<p>時評</p>
<h3>中美經濟合作之觀察</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>舉世矚目之孔祥熙羅斯福談話已於二十九日開始。談話的中心為中美兩國經濟合作問題。美國朝野。對於中國的經濟建設與富源開發。一向懷有深長之興趣。而因為中美兩國邦交素睦。在遠東方面。美國沒有領土野心。中國朝野。對於美國亦有特別的親善與希望。如果利用外資開發中國。是目前應有的國策。則美國資本是我們目前最應該歡迎的。這次談話的成功。會到什麽程度。當依美國對於中國市塲所取得積極態度而决定。</p>
<p>因為多种政治的考慮。美國對於中國市場。態度頗不一定。一部分短見的美國人。認為美國對華輸出。僅佔總輸出很小部份。且多為原料品。美國在華投資。其數量遠遜於英日。而中國所能供給美國之原料品。其他國家。事能供給。同時美國為保有及開拓中國市場。所費之大。所買之險。遠過於所得。故與其依戀中國市場。不如毅然退出。以免因市塲之競爭。啟政治上之糾葛。這種見解在國會方面亦頗有力量。但是中國給予美國的不是眼前的利益。而是未來的偉大希望美國國內富源開發。漸達山窮水盡加拿大與中南美洲。漸慚入於飽和狀態。不能充份地容受美國的利餘資本與商品。只有四萬萬人的中國。為美國經濟前途之所寄託。</p>
<p>近來美國對於中國。在政治上雖沒有像華盛頓九國公約及史汀生不承認主義等積極表示。在經濟方面。仍奮是十分關心的。去年五月陳光甫等和華盛頓政府所訂之銀協定。便是美國積極與中國作經濟上提携之明证。目前美国對華輸入。已佔中國之輸入國第一位。美國商人及資本家們。實無時不運用其非常的競爭持能。戰勝英日法德各國。在自由競爭原則下。取得在中國市場之優勢。何况中國現在不僅在政治統一上已有成就。財政之穩定。亦告成功。經過了數年最嚴重之試驗。全國上下。正積極推進經濟建設。與工業發展之五年計劃。感覺銳利的美國工商界金融界。自然不願放松了這個千載一時的機會。</p>
<p>所以中美經濟合作的條件。目前已十分充份。但是我們不能忘。記中美經濟合作的一個重大障碍。這便是政治問題。要美國金融界對華投資美國政府首先要表示態度。對於他們投資的安全。是否給以充份保證。所謂安全問題。便是當侵略的國家妨害中國之主權。侵犯中國之領土。因而損害了美國在華之利益。美國政府能夠有何種積極行動。關於這個問題。目前的美國政府。恐怕不願有很滿意的表示。因為美國固然在積極準備軍艦飛機。做外交的後援。然而在軍艦未全部完成。飛行根據地未建築完畢。前美國却不願意輕易表示地的遠東政策。他覺得對於侵略好戰的國家。只有拿實際的軍事力量出來做威脅。才可以使他們不敢橫行無忌。而在現在情形之下。美國在武力上尚未能佔絕對優勢。</p>
<p>我們不能厚非美國這種等待政策。延宕主義與唯實態度。但是這種態度確會使願意對華投資的工商界金融界。受到抑制。而中美經濟合作進行之受阻。無異乎給侵略中國的國家以無限鼓勵。我們認為第一美國主張先看實力再作政治表示。是十分合理。然而對華經濟合作。使中國經濟建設完成。便是一種擴大和平力量的工作。中國的國力增加一份侵略國的力量便相對的减低一份所以如果和平需要實力。中美經濟合作。應受鼓勵。第二在美。國海空軍準備未充份以前固然美國不易推行其和平政策。但是藉美國單獨力量維持太平洋一帶美國權益之安全。亦未免太幻想目前美國想與英法中蘇等和平國家。一致聯合。建樹太平洋集體安全制度以維持和平者維持經濟利益。政治問題如因列强合作而解决。則中美經濟合作。前途無量。希。望無量關心中國問題的美國人士。深願其能注意及此。</p>

<h3>雲南建設</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>滇黔兩省、居西南的中心、雲南又處西南的極邊、若兩省公路發展、即可將西南公路網澈底貫通、向來西南的國內交通、多借重國外路綫、如赴西藏、須經過印度、赴雲南須經過安南緬甸、這都是對國防最不利的現象、而令滇黔公路的修築、已完成通車、又如京滇週覽圖、也可由南京直達雲南、過去的弱點、算是可以補救了、</p>
<p>滇黔公路在雲南的一段、即雲南四大幹綫的滇東幹路、所謂四大幹路、都以昆明為中心、㊀滇東幹路、㊁滇東北幹路、都是由昆明通黔川的要道、滇東幹路、修築於民國十七年、由昆明經嵩明尋甸馬龍曲靖霑益平彝等縣、直達貴州的盤縣、現已通車、由曲靖轉陸良師宗羅平、以出貴州的黃草壩一段、世已大體完成、滇東北幹路、由昆明經嵩明尋甸會澤魯旬、以達昭通、現已通車至會澤、會澤至昭通、及由會澤至巧家、亦將修築完工、㊂滇西幹路、是省內最要的幹道、現已通車至大理、㊃滇南幹路、已通車至玉溪、此外昆明市區還有環城路、統計各幹路通車里程、約一千二百零七公里、其餘尚在繼續修築中的、為三千六百零九公里、</p>

<p>全省對外貿易、出口貨以大錫為第一、入口貨以紗布為第一、每年貿易總額、各值國幣一千餘萬元、惟雲南除錫以外、即無大宗輸出品其輸入的紗布、則日益增加、故雲南經濟委員會、乃積極設立紡紗織布廠•及雲南鑛業公司、蓋欲藉是以求貿易平衡也、</p>

<p>箇舊大錫、每年産量約八千餘噸、每噸值國幣二萬餘元、但從前因製造不良、成色不一、必須轉運香港、以粵商提煉改裝、才能運銷外埠、產地僅得微利、後經雲南經委會成立箇舊煉錫公司、設爐加工提煉、乃得圓滿成績、於是箇舊之錫、竟一躍而直達國外倫敦紐約的市場、</p>

<p>元永•阿陋•兩井、是雲南主要的産鹽地、兩井開關的年代已很久、用薪柴煎製、已把附近山林、砍伐馨盡、燃料來路愈遠、成本愈高、兼之灶戶壟斷“承製權、”使民食常受影響、幸發現距兩井約四十里的一平浪地方、盛產煤炭、便在那里設置製鹽廠、將兩井所產鹽滷、順着一條河流的傾斜度、用一種陶製導管、把它(鹽滷）移來就煤、用款達國幣三十萬元、</p>

<h3>市府負責人談麵紛交易所防止廿六年度概算支配</h3>
<p>對市參議會審查意見解釋</p>
<p>關於市參議曾審查二十六年度市預算一案昨日市政府負責人發表談話如下、查前日本市各報載臨時市參議會審核本市二十六年度概算意見、其中所云、“各機關支出經費之中、以俸給占百分之五三•一一辦公及其他等費占百分之四六•八九、而事業建設費中如道路修治費、僅占歲出總額百分之一•五、相形之下、似覺輕重縣殊”等語、對於計算之標凖、似有錯誤之處、以致百分比亦與實際情形不甚符合、恐滋誤會、分別說明如下、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>為力爭制憲的女同胞們進一言</h3>
<p>— 蕭梅</p>
<p>自從三中全會通過了召集國民大會的日期，和國民政府公佈了國大的組織法和選舉法修正案以後，國大代表的競選運動，又在活躍起來了。婦女界方面，因為“我全國二萬萬女同胞之當選為代表者，竟占少數中之少數，以額計之，僅十分之一二，”所以趁選舉法修正案中有一增加政府指派代表二百四十名”的規定，“懇祈就二百四十名指定代表中，盡量增多婦女代表之名額，使結果能得其平，而國民大會，方為我國二萬萬女同胞所擁護。”這運動，日來正在開展中，根據報紙所載，則本市各婦女團體，不僅開過聯席會議，也且發過宣言及通電，在聯席會議上，更且推定代表，赴京出席全國婦女代表大會商討進行事宜，看樣子，是有不達目的，誓不甘休的决心。</p>
<p>婦女既為國民的－份子，她的權利和義務，自然是該和男國民絕對平等。“惟以一向傳統觀念，深入人心，種種待遇，未臻平等，”所以時至今日，雖然“女界同胞近年以來思想學力已非昔比，於社會上供獻之成績，”也“殊不亞於男子，”然而結果卻還是依舊“種種待遇，未臻平等。”此無他，一言以蔽之日：婦女在經濟地位上依舊處於從屬地位是也；經濟方面既操縱在男子之手，那么任馮再把男女平等的口號喊得響些，“種種待遇未臻平等，”則還是要繼續下去的。</p>
<p>然而世間男子也絕非個個都是女子的仇敵，這從過去的各國婦運史上，是不難找到先例的；反之，在婦女羣中，借羣眾為階梯，作個人的登龍，我不敢說有，然而總也不能拍拍胸膛，說絕對沒有吧？</p>
<p>自然，如果這樣說，是難免有名為贊成，而暗使破壞之實的嫌疑的，為了免去這嫌疑，那麼，我對於將來入選的女議員們，請其不要將婦女獲得完全平等的市民權，當作最後的目的，如果如此，如果不把婦女性的奴隸制度和妻子的經濟依賴主義打破，那麼，女議員們或許是和男議員們是“平等”了，於大部份的婦女，則將依舊無益，依舊要“種種待遇，未臻平等”的。奧格斯脫倍倍爾說得好，“數千幸福的婦女的地位改善，是决不能改善婦人全體的一般狀態的。”而現在力争制憲的姊妹們，則正是“數千幸福的婦女。”这一點，還祈真正為婦運着想的婦運者，注意及之也。</p>
<h3>喊</h3>
<p>— 羅荃</p>
<p>人像一條無家的狗，挾着尾巴在街上溜跶；可是隨時隨地會張紅了眼睛，露出了尖銳的牙，跟人在街頭撕打起來，為的是一個小錢，一句互相抵觸的話，或是無意中彼此撞了一下，然後面孔打得青腫，頭髮被撕掉，或者手掌被抓去一塊皮，淌着鮮血，才搜出一條污黑的手帕來包紮着，嘴裏罵了幾句，啐一口唾沫，各自走開。這是我的家鄉。</p>
<p>那些人整天趿着下駄，手電筒插在腰間，褲管抄起來，小刀子便藏在襪子裏。看見那一雙雙獰惡的面扎，如果可能，他們是會在黑暗的巷子裏偸偸地把人做掉的。</p>
<p>街上，洋行，株式會社，商店和金融組合公司輪流着日夜班開門；台灣班子的胡琴從向晚起便拉得分外起勁：談話室却為戒姻的人擺起烟燈，為擺不起烟燈的人打嗎啡針，人習慣了“老海”便連說話都覺梆多餘了。</p>
<p>那海島上有明媚的天野，也隱約有一抹陰影。</p>
<p>家屋的左鄰是一個買辦兼雜物商的人家，每次從那店面走過的時候，我照例向那個肥豬似的本地店主點一下頭，但我卻從來沒有招呼的好意。而且偶然抬頭看見那槐“×××籍民”的小木牌，總也使我不快。</p>
<p>專營高利貸，按日計算利息，用少數的貸金變成多數的本利和，在院子裏拷打貧窮的債戶，這是買辦兼雜貨商的職業。這一個人家也許還敷衍過市民登記稅，而在全市的入口總額裏，這個五口之家也許沒有被統計進去。</p>
<p>一個年青的乳媽被這樣的人家物色到了，為的是照顧那雙胖胖的小肥豬。時常看見一桶小坐車從馬路上推了過去，而乳媽却是憂愁的。</p>
<p>“誰教她在這樣人家裏吃眼淚飯呢？”</p>
<p>那乳媽受了委屈的時候，總跑到人前偸偸垂淚苦訴，人家却在她的背後責備她。</p>
<p>終於有這麽一天，乳媽被那人家的主婦趕走了。隨後那屋子裏便是男子的吵鬧聲，患瘧疾似的哭聲，好像又摔了傢私，搥打了孩子。</p>
<p>“那爛污貨，收留，收留……我不管”。女人吃醋似地哭鬧起來。</p>
<p>像一切難聽的街坊消息一樣，這小</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>風波呌人想到最猥䙝的一面去。</p>
<p>就在那個晚上，我因爲左鄰的哀切的呌喊聲從床上跳了起來，走到靠左邊的窗子，却看見一種殘酷的刑罰被舉行着。</p>
<p>一個人雙脚用索子拴着，倒懸地吊起來，一條鞭子便不辯部位地亂抽，那人殺豬一樣地哀呌起來，但是四周寂静，没有人聲。</p>
<p>在慘澹的燈光下，那人的面孔歪紐着，模樣是那年輕乳媽的男人，一個貧窮的債户。</p>
<p>那哀切的呌喊教人的心臟急促起來，心坎裏有一把憤怒的火。燃燒着，整顆心要爆炸了。</p>
<p>我想喊。</p>
<h3>讀者呼聲一個高職畢業生向教育當局請命</h3>
<p>— 蔣培祖</p>
<p>我是一個高職畢業的學生，感到畢業後受着失業和投考學校太少的二種痛苦，來向教育當局請命。失業在現在的病態社會制度之下，當然是難免的，教育當局也感到束手無策，因為是整個的社會問題，是不能一刻就可以解决了的，所以我們對於這個問題雖然急切，但是也有不得不暫時擱置的苦處。我現在所要請命的是投考學校問題，是敎育當局所能辦得到的問題。按現在有許多學校，不準我們高織畢業的學友投考，因是我對於這些學校，就發生下列三個疑點。</p>
<p>一，就程度說學校的入學試題，旣然以普通中學的課本為依據，那末我們高職畢業的學友，若自審有同等程度去應考，學校方面當須允許，我們投考者，若是不及標準，當然是程度不到，但若是及標準，那豈非表示我們高職的錄取學友和普通中學的錄取學友的程度是相等嗎？我不知道那些限制職學投考的學校是為的什麽道理？</p>
<p>二，就學歷說有許多學校，為防止學生躐等起見，所以要審查畢業年限，若年限不少，就准予考試，這是很對的。可是為何有許多學校，不講年限，而只要是職校畢業就不准考試呢？我在這裏又有點不解。</p>
<p>三，就進修說大學裏所讀的，都是從頭讀起的專門學科，我們高職畢業的學友，一旦為大學所錄取，那末這些學友，就具有同普通中學的學友的同樣的根基，以同樣的根基，讀同樣的學科，這又何分普通學校與職業學校？並且我們有許多學友，他們對於大學裏所欲讀的，他們在職校裏的時候，已經有相當認識，這樣，他們讀起來，當然比那些未曾讀過的要來得容易，旣然容易，成績當然是不會差了。但是這些學友，現在反而連考的資格都被剝奪了，我真有點莫明其妙。</p>
<p>我不懂得敎育原理，甚且不懂得關於敎育的一切，所以我對於上面所說的，不知道是否對或是不對，我急切的期待着敎育當局者來指示，若是敎育當局者，認為我所說是對的，那末現在考期已到，請迅速通令各大學曁與大學相當之各學校，改去那些限制職校投考的條例——已經改去的，接到通令，亦屬無妨——使得我們可以投考；反之，若是敎育當局者，認為我所說是不對的，那末也要請迅速給我們這些想進去而不叮進去的學校的學生，有一個救濟辦法，使我們有一條進去的路。這是我們期待着的，是我們急切所期待着的！</p>

<p>[Chengdu] He Beihong visited Liu Xiang at the provincial government at 6:30 PM on the evening of the 30th for extensive talks.

<p>[Chengdu] According to sources within the provincial government, Liu Xiang is awaiting He Yingqin and Gu Zhutong's arrival in Chongqing on the 5th.

<h3>Fu Zuoyi Discusses the Recent Situation in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>[Guihua] This reporter visited Chairman Fu on the afternoon of the 29th. According to him: (1) Since the 26th, a strange aircraft has been flying reconnaissance missions daily over Hongge'ertu, Damao, Bailingmiao, and other places. The purpose of this is still unclear, but eastern and northern Suiyuan remain very peaceful. (2) The water level of the Yellow River in western Suiyuan has risen approximately five to six feet in recent days, but fortunately, it has risen and fallen intermittently and has not overflowed the dikes. All counties in the province have now received ample rainfall, and the people are at ease. Regarding the flood and drought situation in various provinces, Fu said that in China's more than 4,000 years of history, according to historical records, there have only been 20 years without disasters. This is truly an incredible event. In recent years, the government has made great efforts in disaster prevention and afforestation, and the disaster situation has already been reduced. It is anticipated that in another four or five years, the disaster situation across the country will be further reduced, or even completely avoided. According to Secretary-General Zeng Houzai of the provincial government, Chairman Fu has recently attached great importance to the training of civil servants and educators. A training plan has now been drafted and will be implemented within days. All civil servants will be strictly trained to improve their talents and ensure the political future is bright. According to Shi Huayan, General Consultant of the Mongolian Political Council's Guidance Office, he recently supervised the distribution of disaster relief funds in Bailingmiao and other places. He witnessed abundant rainfall in Mongolia, with lush pasture, unprecedented in recent years. Livestock are also very peaceful and have not suffered from disasters or epidemics. The Mongolian people are very happy. The construction of the Bailingmiao project is divided into three phases. The first phase has already begun, the second phase is well-planned, and the third phase is currently being planned. Shi also said that the National Army stationed in Bailingmiao is in high spirits, which is admirable. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Meets with Roosevelt, Says China Welcomes Foreign Investment</h3>
<p>Organizing Domestic Debt, Developing Resources; Discussing Credit Methods with the United States</p>
<p>[Washington] After Vice President Kong paid his respects to President Roosevelt this morning, he met with approximately 40 reporters from major American newspapers and news agencies, providing detailed explanations on China's finances and budgetary issues. Kong first stated that although China has no plans to borrow from abroad, it is very interested in commercial loans with low interest rates for railway construction and construction programs. Kong then reiterated that China needs not only funds at this time, but also scientific knowledge and expertise to complete the five-year plan for economic construction and industrial development. Kong then said that the purpose of his trip to the United States was threefold: first, to pay his respects and express his gratitude to President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, as they had all cooperated in China's currency reform. Second, to resolve China's foreign debt problem, as evidenced by the recent completion of a solution to the Pacific Construction Company loan. Third, to study the economic and industrial development situation in Europe and the United States. Finally, when answering questions from reporters, Kong said that China's tariff revenue in 1937 could reach 450 million yuan, of which 100 million yuan would be used as security for repaying foreign debt and 200 million yuan would be used as security for domestic public debt, leaving a surplus of 150 million yuan. If low-interest funds could be obtained from abroad to reduce domestic interest rates, China would be willing to do so. (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Chinese Executive Yuan, paid his respects to President Roosevelt today and then gave a speech to various newspapers, stating that China will repay all foreign debts. This is evidenced by the establishment of a solution to the Pacific Construction Bank's five million US dollar loan, which will be repaid anew. Currently, China is very willing for European and American countries to provide assistance in materials, talent, and finance, so that the five-year economic construction plan can be completed. He also said that the results obtained after China's currency reform have been very good, and the 1937 budget can therefore be balanced. Currently, in order to develop China's resources, it is necessary to raise new funds. Therefore, there may be a possibility of exchanging domestic public bonds. The US Export-Import Bank has recently announced that it will allow China to purchase 20 railway locomotives on credit, worth $750,000, to be repaid over five years. Pearson, the general manager of the bank, recently visited China, and the above decision was made after his return from the visit. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Finance Minister Dr. Kong Xiangxi declared today that China is willing to obtain foreign investment to repay domestic debt, as the interest on various domestic debts is as high as 8%, which should be organized. At the same time, China is also willing to obtain foreign credit loans so that it can purchase special commodities in installments. Other than that, China does not want to take on new debt. This statement was made by Kong after visiting President Roosevelt at the White House. President Roosevelt said that he would meet with Kong again after Kong returned from Yale University, probably on Tuesday of next week. Kong also explained his statement, saying that China is very willing to avoid bank loans. Currently, China's tariff revenue, in addition to repaying and securing all foreign debt principal and interest, can still have an annual surplus of 150 million national currency. China's domestic debt totals 2 billion yuan, with 8% interest. If it is changed to 4%, it can save 80 million yuan annually, which can be used for construction. It is said that Kong's conversation with the President was of a general nature, only paying his respects to the President and thanking the President for his cooperation in China's currency reform. Regarding his conversations with Secretary of State Hull and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau yesterday, Kong declined to announce their specific nature, but said that they discussed common problems between the United States and China. Kong also said that he does not intend to raise the silver issue at this time. Since China has been selling silver to the United States, it has many deposits in American banks, but they do not pay interest. It can be seen that the United States currently has a lot of funds, and banks are no longer seeking deposits. If these funds were used to repay China's domestic debt, they could get 4% interest, which would be better than no interest. Moreover, China's credit has been fully restored. For example, all debts to the United States have recently been repaid on time. As for China's five-year plan, it is roughly to develop domestic industry to avoid relying on foreign goods for everything. There are two reasons for this: first, foreign goods are expensive; second, in times of emergency, the source may be cut off. What China needs now is scientific knowledge, technical talent, and sufficient funds. According to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, China welcomes foreign cooperation, as China is eager to develop its inexhaustible resources so that the whole world can benefit. Once resources are developed, the purchasing power of the Chinese people can increase. The United States has a particularly advantageous position in China. First, the relationship between the two countries has always been very harmonious. Second, the two countries are neighbors on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean, and the democratic spirit of the two countries is completely the same, so they can work together. If the American people are willing to invest their surplus capital in China, China can guarantee its safety. China's currency reform has been successful, which has changed the domestic economic situation and greatly improved China's international trade. It is understood that there will be a more detailed discussion when Kong meets with President Roosevelt next time. Tonight, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau is hosting a banquet for Kong, with 30 giants of the financial world attending. Guo Bingwen, Director of the Chinese International Trade Bureau, met with Undersecretary of the Treasury Deller today, but Guo firmly stated that the meeting was only a social visit.

<p>[Washington] Jones, the manager of the American Construction Bank Corporation, announced today that the Export-Import Bank under his company has agreed to lend 750,000 US dollars for China to purchase locomotives. It is said that China is purchasing a total of 20 locomotives, requiring 1.5 million US dollars. 10 locomotives have now been ordered from Baldwin Locomotive Works and American Locomotive Company. These locomotives are the first locomotives China has ordered that are completely made in the United States and will run on various railways in China. Jones also said that Chinese Finance Minister Dr. Kong Xiangxi is still negotiating other credit loans, but because the Chinese government has not yet decided what kind of equipment it needs, the total amount is still unknown. However, what is being considered is probably railway supplies and textile and paper machinery. The Export-Import Bank has no hesitation in granting loans to China, because China can abide by all contracts signed with the United States. The outstanding amount of loans recently granted by the bank to China is 1,300 yuan. (National Dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Observations on Sino-American Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The much-anticipated conversation between Kong Xiangxi and Roosevelt began on the 29th. The focus of the conversation is the issue of economic cooperation between China and the United States. American authorities and the public have always had a deep interest in China's economic construction and resource development. Because Sino-American relations have always been amicable, and because the United States has no territorial ambitions in the Far East, the Chinese authorities and the public also have special goodwill and hope towards the United States. If utilizing foreign capital to develop China is the appropriate national policy at present, then American capital is what we should welcome most at the moment. The degree to which this conversation will be successful will depend on the active attitude of the United States towards the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Due to various political considerations, the United States' attitude towards the Chinese market is quite uncertain. Some short-sighted Americans believe that American exports to China account for only a small part of its total exports, and are mostly raw materials. American investment in China is far less than that of Britain and Japan. And the raw materials that China can supply to the United States can also be supplied by other countries. At the same time, the cost and risk that the United States incurs to maintain and develop the Chinese market far outweigh the gains. Therefore, rather than clinging to the Chinese market, it is better to withdraw decisively to avoid political entanglements due to market competition. This view also has considerable support in Congress. However, what China gives to the United States is not immediate benefit, but great hope for the future. The development of resources within the United States is gradually reaching its limits. Canada and Central and South America are gradually becoming saturated and cannot fully accommodate America's surplus capital and goods. Only China, with its 400 million people, is where the economic future of the United States lies.</p>
<p>Recently, although the United States has not made any active statements on China in political terms, such as the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Stimson Doctrine of non-recognition, it is still very concerned in economic terms. The silver agreement signed by Chen Guangfu and the Washington government last May is clear evidence of the United States' active economic cooperation with China. Currently, American imports to China already rank first among importing countries. American merchants and capitalists are constantly using their extraordinary competitive skills to defeat Britain, Japan, France, and Germany and gain an advantage in the Chinese market under the principle of free competition. Moreover, China has now not only achieved political unification, but also succeeded in financial stabilization. After several years of the most severe tests, the entire country is actively promoting the Five-Year Plan for economic construction and industrial development. The sharp-sighted American business, industrial, and financial circles naturally do not want to let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>Therefore, the conditions for Sino-American economic cooperation are currently very adequate. But we must not forget that a major obstacle to Sino-American economic cooperation is the political issue. If the American financial community is to invest in China, the American government must first express its attitude as to whether they are willing to give full guarantees to the safety of their investments. The so-called safety issue is when an aggressive country hinders China's sovereignty and infringes on China's territory, thereby harming American interests in China. What kind of active action can the American government take? The current American government is probably unwilling to give a very satisfactory response to this question. Because the United States is actively preparing warships and airplanes to support diplomacy, but before the warships are fully completed and the airbases are fully built, the United States is unwilling to easily express its Far East policy. It feels that only by using actual military strength as a threat can aggressive and belligerent countries be prevented from acting recklessly. And under the current circumstances, the United States has not yet achieved absolute superiority in military power.</p>
<p>We cannot blame the United States for this policy of waiting, procrastination, and realism. But this attitude does inhibit the business, industrial, and financial circles willing to invest in China. And the obstruction of Sino-American economic cooperation is tantamount to giving unlimited encouragement to countries that are invading China. We believe that, first, the American advocacy of looking at strength first before making political statements is very reasonable. However, economic cooperation with China, so that Chinese economic construction is completed, is a kind of work that expands the forces of peace. If China's national strength increases by one point, the strength of the aggressor country will be reduced by one point. Therefore, if peace requires strength, Sino-American economic cooperation should be encouraged. Secondly, before the US Navy and Air Force are fully prepared, it is certainly not easy for the United States to promote its peace policy. However, it would be too fanciful to maintain the security of American interests in the Pacific region by the sole power of the United States. At present, the United States wants to unite with peaceful countries such as Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union to build a collective security system in the Pacific to maintain peace and maintain economic interests. If political problems are resolved through cooperation among the great powers, then the future of Sino-American economic cooperation is unlimited. Hope is boundless. American people who care about Chinese issues deeply hope that they can pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Sinks Soviet Russian Gunboat in Heilongjiang</h3>
<p>Negotiations on Island Dispute Just Concluded, Conflict Erupts Again Between the Two Sides</p>
<p>[Changchun] According to the Kwantung Army, the situation between the Soviet Union and Manchukuo is as follows: At 3:00 PM on the 30th, three Soviet warships suddenly intruded into the Jiangtu River south of Ganquanzi, and fired upon the Japanese and Manchukuo troops guarding the area. The Japanese army immediately engaged them, sinking one Soviet gunboat and severely damaging another. The other one was forced to flee. The governments of Japan and "Manchukuo" have promptly lodged a serious protest with the Soviet Union. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>[Changchun] The tense situation caused by the Soviet army's occupation of two small islands in the Heilongjiang River is worsening today. According to a communique issued by the Kwantung Army, the Japanese and "Manchukuo" forces shelled Senufa Island (transliteration) in the two small islands and sank one of the three Soviet gunboats in the Heilongjiang River. The other two, one was severely damaged and one was forced to retreat. The communique also stated that three gunboats sailed into the Heilongjiang River south of Senufa Island this afternoon and shelled the Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops defending the Manchukuo border. The Japanese and "Manchukuo" forces had no choice but to return fire and sank one of them. The number of casualties was not mentioned. The "Manchukuo" government has lodged a serious protest with the Soviet government because the Soviet gunboats recklessly bombarded the Japanese and "Manchukuo" forces. According to reports, after the Soviet army occupied the two small islands, the Japanese government immediately ordered Ambassador to Moscow Shigemitsu Mamoru to protest to the Soviet government. Today, a spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that on the night of the 28th, Shigemitsu informed Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Stomoniakov that Japan had the responsibility to jointly defend "Manchukuo" with the "Manchukuo" government, so it was deeply worried about the overall situation in the Heilongjiang River and wished to restore the peace there as soon as possible in order to preserve peace in the Far East. Therefore, the Japanese government urged the Soviet government to correct the illegal activities of the Soviet army in the Heilongjiang River. At that time, Stomoniakov agreed to report this matter in detail to his government. On the afternoon of the 29th, Shigemitsu again visited Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov to continue negotiations. Litvinov replied that the Soviet government agreed to withdraw the troops from the two islands and restore the original state. When the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Army Ministry heard this news, they were pleased, but unexpectedly, this change occurred again today. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 30th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] On June 29th, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Shigemitsu Mamoru, on the order of his government, visited People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov and asked him to pay attention to the serious situation caused by several islands about 120 kilometers downstream of Blagoveshchensk on the Heilongjiang River. The Japanese government believes that since the Heilongjiang River is between the Soviet Union and the puppet state, the border is in the center of the river, and most of the above-mentioned islands are in the south of the river, they should belong to the puppet state. The fact that Soviet sentries are now stationed on these islands has forced the Kwantung Army to send troops there as well, which may lead to disputes. Litvinov explained to the ambassador that, according to the Treaty of Aigun of 1858 and the Treaty of Peking of 1860, the land on the left bank of the Heilongjiang River belonged to Russia, and the land on the right bank up to the Ussuri River belonged to China." The issue of islands in the river was not mentioned in detail, but it was noted that, in order to make the boundary more clearly defined, both parties should draw a red line on the map attached to the treaty as a definite national boundary. This map was signed and sent to China in 1861. One copy is now kept by the Soviet government, and the other should be in the hands of the Chinese government. Litvinov would find the map and ask the ambassador to carefully observe whether the red line is south of the islands. However, the ambassador avoided discussing this issue. Litvinov continued, according to the documents concluded when the Treaty of Aigun and the Treaty of Peking were concluded, at that time the river flowed south of the islands. However, even if the Heilongjiang River channel has migrated north since the Treaty of Peking was concluded, this cannot become the reason why the islands should automatically belong to the puppet state. This issue can only be resolved through diplomatic negotiations. Therefore, from a legal point of view, the Soviet Union should recognize that the islands do not belong to "Manchukuo," and the local border authorities should have full authority to send sentries to the islands when necessary based on existing treaties and maps. Litvinov continued that the Soviet government had long sought to invite the Japanese side to agree to organize a border commission to investigate all disputes and redraw the border. If the Japanese government agrees to this approach, when the committee starts working, the Japanese side can raise issues such as the migration of the Heilongjiang River channel and the location of the islands. Litvinov also said that, in accordance with its peace policy, the Soviet government never advocates resolving disputes by force, but would rather submit them to discussion. Litvinov proposed to the ambassador that the Soviet and Japanese sides should simultaneously withdraw the troops stationed on the islands, as well as nearby gunboats, so as to conduct diplomatic negotiations in a relatively calm atmosphere. Ambassador Shigemitsu agreed to convey this suggestion to his government and the Kwantung Army Headquarters. At the same time, both parties pledged to take all necessary steps to prevent the situation from being complicated by any unexpected actions. (TASS dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Japanese Ambassador to Moscow Shigemitsu met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Stomoniakov on the morning of the 29th to discuss a solution to the issue of Soviet troops crossing the border to occupy two islands in the Far East. In the afternoon, he met with Foreign Minister Litvinov to convey the Japanese government's view of resolving the issue peacefully and requested that the Soviet Union consider the issue with caution. After the two sides talked for two hours, Litvinov decided to accept Shigemitsu's proposal and agreed to the following two conditions:</p>
<p>(1) The Soviet government ordered the troops on the two islands to withdraw to their original defense positions and restore the original state.</p>
<p>(2) The Soviet government ordered the riverboats, gunboats, etc. gathered near the site to withdraw immediately.</p>
<p>(3) The detailed conditions for resolving this issue will be negotiated separately by the Japanese and Soviet governments. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decides on Budget Formulation Policy</h3>
<p>Ordinance on Central Economic Conference Promulgated</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Cabinet meeting yesterday decided on ten points of the budget formulation policy for the next fiscal year and passed twenty kinds of raw materials that should be investigated for their supply and demand. The decision of these ten policies is intended to realize more planned control in the financial authorities. However, according to general observation, whether it can be effectively implemented in practice is still a problem. For example, the realization of the third point of the policy is very small. The policy stipulates that each province should not use the excuse of rising prices to request an increase in the established expenses, but should save within the original scope. The expansion of armaments has made prices soar, and these expenses will inevitably increase. Furthermore, the fifth point stipulates thrift in order to avoid increasing the cause of foreign silver payments. This point is contrary to the slogan of stabilizing the people's livelihood. The reduction of cargo consumption will naturally increase prices, thereby further oppressing the people's livelihood. Furthermore, no measures to increase revenue are mentioned in the ten points of the policy, which is quite thought-provoking. Therefore, it is not yet known whether the government will increase tax rates or issue more public bonds, or even do both. However, there are great difficulties in implementing any of these policies. The so-called ten points of the policy are only the three principles announced a few days ago, but their method is more concrete. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The ordinance of the Japanese Central Economic Conference was promulgated tonight. Article 1 stipulates the power of the conference as follows: The Central Economic Conference is established under the supervision of the Prime Minister, and shall answer the Prime Minister's consultations and conduct investigations and research on the following matters: (1) The comprehensive economic policy of Japan proper and its colonies, (2) The basic implementation procedures based on the above policy. The Central Economic Conference may also submit suggestions to the Prime Minister on the above two matters. Therefore, the conference has become an important organ for formulating Japan's overall comprehensive economic policy, which is worthy of our serious attention. The eighteen members of the conference were announced today, all of whom are important figures in the banking and business circles, such as Kodama Kenji and Fujiwara Ginjirō, who are all members of the conference.

<h3>Pang Lai Explains the Financial Situation</h3>
<p>Attending the House of Representatives Finance Committee</p>
<p>[Paris] The House of Representatives Finance Committee held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the bill proposed by the Chautemps Cabinet requesting broad powers in financial matters.  By a majority of twenty votes to fifteen, with six abstentions, the bill was passed without amendment. Five of the six abstentions were from Communist Party members.  The full text of the bill is extremely brief, with only one article advocating that Congress authorize the government, until August 31 of this year, to: ⑴ prohibit all attempts to undermine national credit; ⑵ compete against speculative transactions; ⑶ reorganize the economic situation; ⑷ control commodity prices; ⑸ find ways to restore budget balance; ⑹ protect the cash reserves of the Bank of France, but without adopting exchange controls.  The passage of the financial bill by the Finance Committee was due to the Finance Minister Pang Lai's attendance and explanation. Pang Lai's speech was concise, to the point, and earnestly stated that if the current situation continues unabated, it will inevitably endanger the country's financial independence and military security, and that all social facilities and economic recovery will inevitably be hindered. It was found that government regular budget expenditures exceeded revenue, amounting to between 60 billion and 100 billion francs.  The current interim budget deficit has reached a huge 85 billion francs. Recent cash outflows, up to June 28, according to a report from the Ministry of Finance, totaled 77 billion francs. The funds currently available to the treasury are only 20 billion francs. In order to supply various regular expenditures, the government must borrow 40 billion francs from the "Deposit and Consignment Office" (this is an independent institution that holds various private funds involved in unresolved disputes and estates for which heirs have not been determined). Such a financial deficit shows that a financial bill is indeed necessary. Pang Lai then explained that in order to cope with the current situation after the government obtains broad powers, the first steps it will take are three: First, to abolish the minimum limit on the gold parity of the franc. According to the monetary law of October 1 last year, the minimum amount of pure gold contained in each franc should be 0.043 grams, but when the franc is under severe pressure, this limit will inevitably create difficulties and should be abolished. Second, the amount of advances from the Bank of France to the state should be increased by 10,000,000,000 francs. Third, taxes should be increased. Finally, he said that the government has resolved not to increase spending in the future. A committee member raised a question about the monetary agreement between Britain, France, and the United States. Pang Lai replied that British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon and U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau would soon issue declarations on this matter. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Detailed Debates in the French House of Representatives</h3>
<p>[Paris] The House of Representatives convened at 9:00 PM tonight to discuss the financial bill proposed by the Chautemps Cabinet.  First, House of Representatives Finance Committee rapporteur Schmid (Radical Socialist Party) presented a review report to the House of Representatives, explaining the reasons why the Finance Committee passed the government's bill, saying, "Saving the motherland should now become our highest and most supreme law." He then recounted the various figures presented by Finance Minister Pang Lai to the Finance Committee, stating that before the end of this year, the Ministry of Finance will need 17,000,000,000 francs to repay various short-term treasury bonds. The document stated that the government has negotiated with London and New York to suspend trading in francs, and that future monetary measures taken by the French government, according to the monetary agreement between Britain, the United States, and France, will be taken with the consent of Britain and the United States. At this point, several opposition members spoke in turn, criticizing the government's contradictory policies. Among them, central faction Representative Herriot spoke, saying, "What you have organized is a government of the Popular Front, and you have adopted the platform of the Popular Front, but the measures you have proposed are not found in the platform of the Popular Front. You only know how to obey the masses, but you should know that obedience is not the same as ruling." At this point, the House of Representatives adjourned briefly, resuming at 1:05 AM. Then, former Finance Minister Renault, a central faction Representative, spoke, "The Blum Cabinet, four months after devaluing the currency, had to borrow from foreign countries and use cash as collateral. This is probably the only government in the world to do this. Now the new government is again asking us to devalue the currency again to remedy the mistakes made by the Blum Cabinet." Renault continued to harshly criticize the previous cabinet's financial policies, saying that the beneficial consequences of the franc devaluation were completely wiped out by the previous cabinet's social policies. "Given the current situation, although general production has increased by 11%, France still has to import coal worth 4,000,000,000 francs from foreign countries due to insufficient production." Regarding the outflow of French capital, Renault questioned Prime Minister Chautemps, asking whether he would take the measures that the previous Blum Cabinet had taken, or whether he would adopt a "policy of trust." "If he cannot fully adopt a 'policy of trust,' then failure is undoubtedly inevitable." Renault then expressed his deep fear that the government's attempts to revive the economy would not succeed. If this were the case, it would not be due to opposition from Congress, but to the agitation of the masses. "France has made a mistake once. If it makes the same mistake again, the consequences will be unimaginable." At this point, the House of Representatives adjourned again briefly, resuming at 11:40 PM. Then, left-wing non-affiliated Representative Peyrouton spoke, saying, "In the next two years, the Popular Front government may not be able to destroy the financial oligarchy, but the financial oligarchy will certainly not be able to destroy the Popular Front government. Former Prime Minister Blum announced that various social reform projects that had been adjusted would have to be temporarily suspended. This was a big mistake. In the future, the stalemate between the Popular Front and the financial oligarchy still exists and has not been resolved." At 12:20 AM, Finance Minister Pang Lai finally took the podium to explain the government's financial bill, saying that the government will take strict measures to eliminate speculation, but the fundamental solution lies in restoring the health of the treasury and the budget, and preventing a large number of small savers from becoming uneasy. At present, taxes should be increased and various expenses should be tightened. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan's Trade Deficit is Very Large</h3>
<p>For the First Six Months of This Year, it Has Increased More Than Double Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Japan's trade deficit in late June this year reached 16 million yen. Therefore, the total deficit for the first half of this year has reached 64.1 million yen. The total value of exports for the first half of this year was 1,617,770,000 yen, and the total value of imports was 2,242,880,000 yen. The total value of imports for the first half of last year was 1,578,100,000 yen, and the total value of exports was 1,263,680,000 yen, with a deficit of more than 31.4 million yen. Therefore, the deficit for the first half of this year has increased by more than double compared to the same period last year. This huge deficit has only been exceeded by the deficit at the end of the Taisho era in the history of Japan's international trade, when a large number of goods were imported to deal with the aftermath of the Great Kanto Earthquake, resulting in a deficit of 663,000,000 yen.

<h3>The Supervision System is on the Verge of Collapse; Britain Makes Concessions</h3>
<p>May Recognize the Warring Factions in Spain; The Principle of Non-Interference Can Be Preserved</p>
<p>[London] Responsible sources recently declared that if Germany and Italy were to propose recognizing the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups, then as long as the principle of non-interference continues to be effective, Britain may consider this proposal favorably. Prime Minister Chamberlain met with Foreign Secretary Eden this evening to study the Spanish issue. It is reported that they have already agreed that if the non-interference plan collapses, the only solution is to recognize both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups. Regarding this, general observers explained that recognizing belligerent groups does not mean diplomatically recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government, and stated that according to recent news from Rome, the Italian government believes that if the rights of the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War are recognized as belligerent groups, then Italy can also accept maintaining the principle of non-interference, as Italy observes that recognition will facilitate the Nationalists and allow them to impose a blockade on the east coast. From this point of view, the principle of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War may still be preserved as a result. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Supervisory Work on the Portuguese-Spanish Border</h3>

It seems that there is no need for British inspectors to continue to represent the Non-Intervention Committee in carrying out its work. However, after a solution to this issue is found, Portugal is still willing to cooperate. (30th, Guomin dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Chabei People's Army Led by Li Ying Approaches Dolon</h3>
<p>Chen Bingjun Gathers Righteous People in Various Places; Li Haiqing and Others Concentrate in Heihechuan</p>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence: The morale of the Chabei bandits and puppet troops has recently become increasingly shaken because of a reduction in support from a certain party and because puppet leaders De Wang, Li Shouxin, and others have greatly lost the favor of a certain party. Even secondary figures among them who have some foresight are actively attempting to protect themselves. Recently, Li Mingyuan, the deputy commander of the 6th Division of the puppet Mengjiang Army stationed in Gonghui, secretly dispatched his confidant Zhang Zidong to Heihechuan to contact Li Ying, the leader of the People's Army, hoping to lead his troops to revolt and atone for his sins. If the People's Army launches an attack, he is determined to respond internally with his entire force. Li Ying is currently discussing and considering this with his commander-in-chief, Li Tingfang. The recent activities of the People's Army in various parts of Chabei are roughly as follows: ⑴ Li Ying's cavalry, numbering about 700, advanced from Bielagou in Weichang County on June 26 with the aim of approaching Dolon County. ⑵ Liang Guangfu, a righteous citizen of Shibaipan, has gathered a large number of armed people, and Li Ying is sending personnel to count and incorporate them. ⑶ Lu Zhengang, a righteous citizen of Chifeng, Rehe, is leading more than a thousand armed people and is advancing westward from Chifeng towards Guyuan, Chabei. ⑷ Li Haiqing, formerly the commander-in-chief of the Northeast Volunteer Army and currently the commander-in-chief of the East Route of the Self-Defense Army, has recently recruited several thousand people from various local militias and fire associations (similar to Lian Zhuang Associations) in the Jidong war zone and is currently advancing towards Heihechuan, Guyuan, and Dolon. After the connections between the various routes are established and their strength is enhanced, they can launch a large-scale offensive. ⑸ Li Tingfang has now appointed Chen Bingjun as the Southern Route Pacification Envoy and Commander-in-Chief of the Reserve Army. Chen Bingjun is currently active in various places and gathering righteous armies to serve as reinforcements. (June 27)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Rice Merchants Request Interpretation of Inspection Standards</h3>
<p>If Inspection Procedures Are Not Certain, National Rice Transportation and Sales Will Be Very Difficult</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Ministry of Industry has established rice and wheat inspection offices in various rice-producing provinces in order to standardize rice and wheat quality and raise prices. It has first been implemented in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, with the cooperation and assistance of the two provincial governments. In Anhui Province, Wuhu is the concentration area for rice in southern Anhui, and Bengbu is the meeting place for wheat and barley in northern Anhui. Therefore, in addition to establishing a rice inspection office in Wuhu, a wheat inspection office has also been established in Bengbu. Bengbu has been scheduled to start inspection on July 1, and Wuhu is also actively preparing, so it can be established before the new grain appears. However, the Wuhu Rice and Grain Transportation Industry Association believes that Article 1 of the National Product Inspection Regulations passed by the Executive Yuan stipulates that products that have not passed inspection and obtained a certificate shall not be transported or sold. The two issues of rice and grain inspection procedures and the so-called qualified standards need to be carefully considered in fact. Because of the complexity of the situation, if it is not decided in advance, it will have a major impact on the production and sales of national rice, especially since the association is a group of rice collection groups stationed in Wuhu in various rice sales areas in Guangdong, Chaozhou, and Ningbo, specializing in wheel transportation and export, and has a close relationship with its own interests. At this time when the law on inspecting rice has not been promulgated, it specifically raises the above two questions and submits them to the Ministry of Industry, requesting an explanation to follow. The following is an excerpt of the points it requests for instructions: ⑴ Rice and Grain Standards: Upon inspection, the rice and grain exported from the port of Wuhu are transported from various agricultural production areas in the north and south of the Yangtze River. If the grades are subdivided, there are many names, and there are no less than hundreds of species. However, merchants and the people cannot know in advance which ones are qualified and which ones are not. If those who have already purchased and stockpiled them are awaiting transportation, but are suddenly deemed unqualified due to inspection, how will those who are unqualified be handled? Also, those who collect and transport rice and grain include those who purchase and transport from various production areas in the north and south of the Yangtze River, and those who purchase from local mills. Each household varies from dozens of piculs to hundreds of piculs, and some even purchase from small grain stores in small towns in the north and south, purchasing from scattered small farmers from one or two piculs to form a large quantity. If the rice and grain purchased in this mixed manner is inspected, and it is said that some are qualified and some are not, what remedial measures will be taken for those who are unqualified? This is the first point to ask for instructions. ⑵ Inspection Procedures: Regarding this issue, what should be studied is, first, who should be inspected, should the inspection be carried out on firms, or should it be carried out on rice mills or those who transport rice to Wuhu, or should it be carried out on those who collect and transport? Secondly, when should the inspection be carried out, should it be inspected during processing, or should it be inspected during storage, or should it be inspected during export? However, the collection and transportation firms are the exporters, each of whom purchases rice and grain to await transportation and export, and the purchase of certain rice and grain is determined according to the needs of the sales area. The time of collection and transportation and the amount of collection and transportation are determined according to market prices and various other relationships. When the shipment is about to start, a ship is chartered to load and export, and the date of arrival is estimated, so as to make a small profit of one in ten. Therefore, if an inspection is carried out on the collection and transportation firms, there is not only a risk of failing the inspection, but also a loss of opportunity due to the inspection, and the loss can be considerable. Moreover, if a chartered ship is delayed by one day, there will be a large amount of compensation to be paid. Therefore, if an inspection is carried out on the collection and transportation industry, they are even more worried. This is another point to ask for instructions. Now that the autumn harvest is imminent, and new grain is about to appear, and there will be a large amount of collection and transportation, how can we remain silent about what we consider to be dangerous? For this reason, we are submitting our views and requesting your inspection. We humbly ask for your instructions and travel correspondence.</p>

<h3>Yunnan Construction</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>Yunnan and Guizhou provinces are located in the center of the Southwest. Yunnan is situated at the extreme edge of the Southwest. If the highways in these two provinces are developed, the Southwest highway network can be thoroughly connected. Domestic transportation in the Southwest has long relied heavily on foreign routes. For example, going to Tibet requires passing through India, and going to Yunnan requires passing through Annam and Burma. These are all phenomena most unfavorable to national defense. Now, the construction of the Yunnan-Guizhou Highway has been completed and opened to traffic. Furthermore, as depicted in the "Kyoto-Yunnan Panoramic Map," one can now travel directly from Nanjing to Yunnan. Past weaknesses can be considered remedied.</p>
<p>The section of the Yunnan-Guizhou Highway within Yunnan Province is the eastern trunk road of Yunnan's four major trunk lines. The so-called four major trunk roads all have Kunming as their center: ㊀ the eastern Yunnan trunk road; ㊁ the northeastern Yunnan trunk road. These are both vital routes from Kunming to Guizhou and Sichuan. The eastern Yunnan trunk road was constructed in the 17th year of the Republic (1928). It runs from Kunming through Songming, Xundian, Malong, Qujing, Zhan Yi, Pingyi, and other counties, directly reaching Pan County in Guizhou. It is now open to traffic. The section from Qujing, turning to Luliang, Shizong, and Luoping, to Huangcaoba in Guizhou, has been largely completed. The northeastern Yunnan trunk road runs from Kunming through Songming, Xundian, Huize, and Luxun, reaching Zhaotong. It is now open to traffic to Huize. The section from Huize to Zhaotong, and from Huize to Qiaojia, will also soon be completed. ㊂ The western Yunnan trunk road is the most important trunk road in the province and is now open to traffic to Dali. ㊃ The southern Yunnan trunk road is open to traffic to Yuxi. In addition, there is a ring road in Kunming city. The total mileage of the open trunk roads is approximately 1,207 kilometers, with an additional 3,609 kilometers still under construction.</p>
<p>Regarding communications infrastructure, the first priority is to expand telegraph offices in important counties and districts, and to widely establish radio receivers in various counties. The provincial capital's broadcasting station broadcasts news daily. The second priority is to set up long-distance telephones, with Kunming as the center. Nearly twenty counties are currently connected.</p>
<p>In terms of the province's foreign trade, tin is the top export, and cotton cloth is the top import. The total annual trade value for each is over ten million yuan in national currency. However, besides tin, Yunnan has no other major export products, while the import of cotton cloth is increasing. Therefore, the Yunnan Economic Commission is actively establishing spinning and weaving factories and the Yunnan Mining Company, hoping to achieve trade balance through these efforts.</p>
<p>The spinning, weaving, and power plants are located in the southern suburbs of Kunming City, covering an area of 120 mu (approximately 8 hectares). The cost of the machinery is estimated at 800,000 yuan in national currency, and the construction cost is 300,000 yuan. The working capital after commencement will be 1 million yuan. Sixty percent of the capital is government shares, and 40 percent is commercial shares. The factory buildings adopt the latest modern and rational sawtooth-shaped architecture. To suit the local environment and materials, they are built of wood. Water pipes and fire buckets are installed between the beams and columns to prevent fires. There are also atomizers that can be used to adjust humidity when the air is dry and to condense flying fibers and clean the air. The currently installed machinery is expected to spin 5,200 spindles and operate 60 looms. In the future, it can be expanded to 40,000 spindles and 600 looms as needed. The main product is 10-count yarn. Since the quality of cotton products in the province has not yet reached the desired standard, the first step is to purchase foreign cotton for spinning to resist the import of coarse yarn. In the future, after using provincial cotton, foreign cotton will no longer need to be imported. The power plant can generate 1,200 kilowatts of electricity. Besides supplying the spinning and weaving plants for their own use, it can also be exported for the city's lighting. The power plant is entirely electrically powered. Except for the looms, each machine is powered by a single motor, so that the failure of one part will not affect the entire operation. This also eliminates the danger of belt entanglements. Twenty male workers and one hundred female workers have been recruited for training. They are expected to start producing yarn and cloth within May. In the future, they will work in day and night shifts, and it is planned to increase the workforce by 300 people. Workers' salaries are based on work performed and are temporarily set at 30 to 50 cents per day in national currency.</p>
<p>Yunnan is known for its abundant mineral resources. The Mining Corporation, which is currently being planned, will start with tin mining. The capital is set at 3 million yuan in national currency, jointly operated by government and businesses. Equipment for a hydroelectric power plant has already been started, and it is expected to be completed in two years. Scientific methods will be used for mining, transportation, and refining to achieve large-scale production. Based on this foundation, the exploration and mining of other minerals will be undertaken.</p>
<p>The annual output of tin in Gejiu is approximately 8,000 tons, valued at over 20,000 yuan in national currency per ton. However, in the past, due to poor manufacturing and inconsistent quality, it had to be shipped to Hong Kong for refining and repackaging by Cantonese merchants before it could be sold to other locations. The production area only received meager profits. Later, the Yunnan Economic Commission established the Gejiu Tin Refining Company, which processed and refined the tin, achieving satisfactory results. As a result, Gejiu tin directly reached markets in London and New York.</p>
<p>The Yunnan Economic Commission was established in the spring of the 24th year of the Republic (1935). The heads of various departments were designated as ex-officio members, and Miao Yuntai, the president of the Fudian New Bank, was the standing member. The commission's fixed capital includes 600,000 yuan in national currency allocated by the provincial government, and approximately 500,000 yuan in national currency allocated annually from the surplus of salt affairs. The purpose is solely to manage economic construction projects. In addition to the aforementioned spinning and weaving factories, there are also: ㊀ a metal tool manufacturing factory that produces various light industrial machine parts, enamelware, wood lacquered goods, electroplated metal goods, and woolen carpets; ㊁ an electrical copper factory; ㊂ the Maliao River Water Conservancy Project, which involves digging a canal, installing pumping stations, and irrigating 50,000 mu (approximately 3,333 hectares) of dry land with water from Kunming Lake; ㊃ joint management of the Kaimeng Reclamation Zone in Kaiyuan and Mengzi counties. After the project is completed, over 500,000 mu (approximately 33,333 hectares) of arable land can be added; ㊄ the Xiaolongtan Refining Plant. Near the Dian-Vietnam Railway, there are exposed coal seams as thick as 30 meters, with no bottom in sight. After multiple tests, the coal can be processed using a low-temperature dry distillation method to extract non-explosive gasoline, semi-coke, coal tar, and gas. Non-explosive gasoline is most suitable for use in airplanes. Semi-coke and coal tar can be made into coal bricks with the highest heat. Gas can be used as fuel.</p>
<p>The Finance Department has also organized a Tungsten-Antimony Company to mine tungsten and antimony. The capital is 1 million yuan in national currency, jointly operated by government and businesses, with government shares accounting for 70% and commercial shares accounting for 30%. The antimony mine in Zhicun is already building factories for mining and large-scale refining. Antimony is also produced in Pingyi and Guangnan counties, but due to inconvenient transportation, only one factory is built nearby to perform preliminary refining, which is then transported to Zhicun for further refining. A branch company has been established in Zhicun to purchase antimony ore mined by other mining merchants. Tungsten mines are being explored by a branch company established in Gejiu, and the quantities are also considerable. Silver mines have been discovered in Sanjianshan, Chuxiong. Originally a lead mine, it contains a large amount of silver that can be refined. The mountain originates in Midu and meanders through Xiangyun, Puning, Zhennan, and other places. The mountain range is majestic, and the forest is as vast as the sea. Coal mines are also produced in the nearby mountains. If they are officially mined in the future, local materials can be used. Once the forest is depleted, it can be replaced by coal. This is certainly a good mining area.</p>
<p>Yuanyong and Alou are the main salt-producing areas in Yunnan. The opening of these two wells dates back a long time. They are made by firewood boiling, and the nearby mountains and forests have been completely cut down. The farther the fuel comes from, the higher the cost. In addition, the stove households monopolize the "production rights," which often affects people's food supply. Fortunately, it was discovered that Yipinglang, about 40 li (approximately 20 kilometers) from the two wells, is rich in coal. A salt factory was set up there, and the brine produced by the two wells was moved along the slope of a river using ceramic pipes to utilize coal. The cost reached 300,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>Emergency Relief Measures for the Drought in Guizhou Province</h3>
<p>Relief funds of 450,000 yuan are distributed to 44 counties.</p>
<p>Guiyang Communication: The drought in Guizhou Province has lasted for ten months, affecting 62 counties and over 2.72 million people. Its severity is no less than the provincial drought of the 14th year of the Republic (1925). The central government has sent senior officials to conduct on-site inspections and has successively allocated 400,000 yuan in relief funds from the Ministry of Finance. Minister He Jingzhi donated 5,000 yuan, the Shanghai Guizhou Disaster Relief Association donated 115,200 yuan, Hu Wenhu donated 10,000 yuan, and Zou Dianbang, Chen Xiaoshi, the General Staff Headquarters, and others also made donations. As of recently, a total of 517,315 yuan has been received. Adding the donations from various parties that have not yet arrived and the fundraising by the Relief Association, the estimated total is around 700,000 yuan. The Provincial Relief Association and the Ministry of Finance, along with Yan Guofu, a special commissioner for Guizhou disaster relief, consulted and decided to use 450,000 yuan for emergency relief in 44 counties, including Zunyi. The relief affairs branch associations in each county will be responsible for the implementation, and the Provincial Relief Association will send one director to each county to be responsible for supervising the distribution. The method is to strictly remove the lightly affected areas in each county and the lightly affected households in the severely affected areas. Then, the disaster victims, both adults and children, will fill out relief tickets. Each adult should receive at least one yuan, and each child should receive 50 cents. However, if there are adults and children in one household, such as one adult and one child or one adult and three children, they will still receive two yuan or three yuan to simplify calculations. All relief tickets will be sent directly to the disaster victims by the county relief branch association, which will temporarily assign local impartial gentry or teachers to assist the staff. The relief distribution points will be based on the bao (neighborhood) and will be no more than twenty li (approximately 10 kilometers) apart. Compared to past relief distribution methods, it is now more rigorous and convenient, and it may be possible to avoid corruption in the middle and allow the disaster victims to receive real benefits. In addition to emergency relief, the remaining funds will be used for work-for-relief projects after they are collected. One water conservancy project will be implemented in each of the four directions (east, south, west, and north), and the Construction Department is currently planning the details. The list of counties receiving emergency relief and the amount of relief funds allocated to each county are attached below.</p>

<h3>Xiamen University to Become Nationalized</h3>
<p>▲Government to Allocate 290,000 Next Year ▲Chen Jiageng to Focus on Jimei Schools</p>
<p>(Xiamen Communication) The nationalization of Xiamen University has been in the works for a long time. According to recent news from Nanjing, "After multiple consultations between the school authorities and the Ministry of Education, it has been decided that the school will be nationalized. The funding has been included in the budget for the 26th year of the Republic (1937), totaling 290,000 yuan." Recently, when Lin Wenqing, the president of the school, went to Beijing to discuss Xiamen University's funding and improvement methods with the Ministry of Education, Chen Jiageng, the founder of the school, telegraphed Lin to negotiate cautiously, ensuring that Xiamen University would obtain a fundamental improvement plan. When Lin arrived in Beijing and conveyed Chen's views, the authorities were determined to nationalize the school and stated that if the founder insisted on his original views, the government could not increase the annual subsidy of 130,000 yuan. Lin telegraphed Chen for instructions, and Chen also recognized the necessity of nationalizing Xiamen University. However, he hoped that personnel and administration would still seek Chen's opinions, and that the selection of the president was of utmost importance and should be sought in cooperation with the Ministry of Education. According to news from Xiamen University, Xu Dishan has been internally designated. Xu is from Zhangzhou, Fujian, and is a famous writer known in the Chinese literary world for his book "Empty Mountain Spirit Rain" (Kongshan Lingyu). According to another source, Lin Zhiqing will continue as president. The central government intends to commend the founder of the school, but Chen declined, believing that investing in education is a national duty and that he has no right to claim national honors. Chen's recent fundraising in Singapore for the Xiamen University fund amounted to 180,000 Singapore dollars (equivalent to more than 350,000 yuan in national currency), which he decided to transfer to the Jimei School fund to enrich the school. The school is very large, with middle schools (senior and junior), commercial, fishery, agricultural and forestry, elementary, kindergarten, and other schools, except for the normal school, which was suspended this year due to provincial government regulations. From the next semester, normal school students, middle school, commercial, and fishery schools will be exempt from tuition and accommodation fees, and agricultural schools will also be exempt from meal fees. Chen Jiageng independently founded both Jimei and Xiamen Universities. Xiamen University was founded in the tenth year of the Republic (1921), and construction equipment was regularly funded independently. By the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the investment reached 4 million yuan (the same as Jimei). After the 20th year of the Republic, the world economy was affected, and Chen's business failed. He began to receive subsidies from the Ministry of Education, more than 100,000 yuan each year, ranking first among the subsidies for private universities. The provincial government subsidized 60,000 yuan per year. Two years ago, the number of students decreased to more than 300, and the annual tuition revenue was more than 10,000 yuan, while the expenditure still required more than 280,000 yuan after two rounds of reduction and consolidation. Even with national and provincial subsidies, it was still insufficient by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. The provincial government even considered stopping the subsidy, which was unsustainable. Students have repeatedly advocated for nationalization, but Chen had a strong sense of responsibility and did not want to shirk his responsibilities. He requested the Ministry of Education to increase the subsidy and raised funds for Xiamen University in Singapore. The Ministry of Education believed that Xiamen University needed a thorough reorganization of its performance, personnel, and administration. This point was recognized not only by the Ministry of Education and the provincial government, but also by the general public and even Xiamen University students and some faculty members. A thorough reorganization can only be achieved through nationalization. Otherwise, increasing the subsidy would not benefit Xiamen University itself. However, the Ministry of Education still respected Chen's opinions and did not want to force him, so it delayed for more than a year. Now Chen has agreed. (June 30)</p>

Yan Wei, Director of the Sui Education Department, plans to invite famous figures in the domestic education community to Sui to speak to the trained primary and secondary school teachers.</p>
<h3>Textbook Fonts Consider Student Eyesight</h3>
<p>Explanation from the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously received a report from the Hunan Education Department regarding the proposal of Cao Fei, a teacher at the Provincial First Normal School, on measures to alleviate nearsightedness among middle school students. The Ministry of Education has instructed the department to respond. The report from the department states: "The font size, spacing, line spacing, illustrations, paper, printing, etc. of textbooks are all part of the review standards. Our department has always paid close attention to this when reviewing cases. The main text of junior high school textbooks uses No. 4 font, and the main text of senior high school textbooks uses No. 5 font. Annotations after the main text are allowed to use a smaller font because they are only for reference and not for reading. If there are cases of overly dense arrangements, overly small illustrations, blurry printing, poor paper quality, or glare that harms eyesight, we have instructed corrections to be made at any time. As for horizontal alignment, it has been proven by experts that it is better than vertical alignment and does not harm eyesight." Since this case has been closely monitored by the department, there is no need for separate regulations. The department should inform the teacher accordingly.</p>

<h3>Liang Yugao Arrives in Shanghai from Yunnan to Discuss the Significance of the Yunnan-Burma Border Demarcation</h3>
<p>Peace Should Begin with Mutual Respect for the Law; Borderland Development Should Start with Sanitation</p>
<p>Liang Yugao, the Chinese representative of the Sino-Burmese Border Commission, has returned to Nanjing to report on his mission, which has come to an end. He arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from Yunnan. According to an interview with a reporter from the Central News Agency, "I have been in Yunnan for more than half a year since I flew from Shanghai to Yunnan last November. On January 2 of this year, we continued to meet at Lao Chang until the official closing meeting on April 23. In the two sessions of the conference, there were a total of one hundred and sixteen meetings. On the 24th, I and my colleagues left the border and returned to Kunming, traveling through Lancang, Nanjiao, Fohai, Cheli, Sifang, Ning'er, Eshan, Yuxi, and other counties. On May 24, we arrived in Kunming, the journey taking exactly one month. Half a year of living like birds, familiar with the tribes of draped hair and tattoos. Today, I have returned to Shanghai and once again see modern civilization, as if I have gone through two worlds. The task of the joint survey is that both sides should seek the truth of border affairs with an objective spirit and report the research results to both governments. This report will be made public by both governments in the future, so there is no need to go into detail here. Now, it is better to take this opportunity to tell you the significance of this border survey."</p>
<p>This Central government's</p>
<p>joint survey is purely a peaceful method and an equal status to resolve the land dispute. This initiative, at a time when land plundering is rampant, is like an awakening bell in the crowd. Looking at the battles since the Great War, those who fight for cities kill people until the cities are full, and those who fight for land kill people until the fields are full, consuming countless amounts of money and sacrificing countless lives. The reason is only to use unlimited ambition to fight for limited land. After the Great War, the world expanded its armaments, and the war for re-dividing the world is faintly waiting to break out. It is also the desire for land that triggers the killing of mankind. At a time when there is no way to call for a peaceful solution, this peaceful method of resolving land disputes is actually carried out between two major countries like China and Britain, which is a very meaningful thing. It is even more necessary to have a deeper understanding. Since we recognize this move as an advocacy of world peace, we should also experience the method of seeking peace in this dispute. Originally, each country and each nation has its own interests. It is almost impossible to prevent them from competing. What should be paid attention to is guiding this dispute into a normal track. This normal track is the principle of law. This Sino-British joint survey of the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma border is purely based on legal procedures to handle everything, turning the battlefield into a conference venue, and the two sides use rationality to deal with the proposals. If it is reasonable, we can fight for it. If it is unreasonable, we will not adopt it. Therefore, the method of peaceful resolution is completed. However, what is important is that both countries equally respect the law. Otherwise, how can there be no courts in the world, and human struggles continue as before. Therefore, peace should begin with mutual respect for the law. While China is being watched by strong enemies, it can still lead the peace movement with another strong friendly country. This shows that today's world should not care about the dispute over inches of land, but should focus on greater benefits. The narrow-minded dispute only cares about the immediate interests, resulting in bad results, and often loses more than it gains. Both sides suffer. On the contrary, friendship and mutual assistance ultimately benefit both sides. This point was clearly understood by former President Wang, so when he was also the Foreign Minister, he sent people like me to the border to handle joint survey matters with the spirit of peace and law. After two years of work, we can bring the long-standing border case between China and Britain to an end, which cannot be attributed to former President Wang's instructions. I hope that after this section of border affairs is written, China and Britain will develop commerce and promote transportation with an attitude of equality and mutual assistance, and my country's southwest border area will increase prosperous areas, then the good results of peace work can be used as a world law. Secondly, what I saw on the border trip can also be told to you. Today, the youth of our country are concentrated in cities, and farmers are crowded in the interior. There are too many urban populations and limited positions, resulting in unemployment. There are many good farmers in the countryside, but there is limited cultivated land and they want to cultivate without land. However, the situation in the border area is just the opposite. In the Shan ethnic area, there are no beggars, because not only do all cultivators have their land, but there is also more land than people. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of lack of cultivated land and the problem of unemployment, we urgently need to immigrate and colonize the border. However, if we investigate, why has the border colonization movement not been enthusiastic for hundreds of years? Because the concept of "dampness" in the border area is deeply rooted in the minds of the people, and this fear is not without reason. It is reported that malaria is prevalent in the Enpu area, which has been for fifteen or sixteen years. The population has decreased from 200,000 to 20,000. During the epidemic in March and April of this year, some people died within 24 hours of onset. When I passed through the area, the infectious disease had just subsided two weeks ago. The threat of death was so terrifying that those who lived there still wanted to move, and those who had not arrived were even more hesitant to move forward, let alone develop. Therefore, I advocate that today, the development of the border area should be led by sanitation work. Looking at Panama before it was opened, travelers and workers regarded it as a terrible place. As a result of conquering infectious diseases, it has now become a transportation hub. Greece, Spain, and Portugal were once the mothers of civilization, and the latter two once held the world's hegemony, but they all declined due to their inability to overcome the attack of malaria. If the health of the people is not guaranteed, survival is not guaranteed, let alone other things. The current limitations of Yunnan Province's economy can only be a palliative measure, such as distributing  quinine and establishing local hospitals, etc. However, the disease goes away with the medicine, and the disease comes again when the medicine is used up, which is not a fundamental cure. This kind of serious natural disaster is worse than drought. I hope that the central government will find ways to provide relief as soon as possible, and select experts to investigate the fundamental cause of the malaria epidemic and promote a planned fundamental cure. I believe that this kind of expenditure on epidemic prevention will definitely be many times the future gains in increasing people's productivity. Otherwise, the epidemic will spread and harm the whole country. Yunnan is an important town for national defense, and the country's strength and resources must be rectified as soon as possible. Recently, we have repeatedly awakened all walks of life to pay attention to these situations. In the near future, there will definitely be some progress.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau Discuss Opium Prohibition in the Concessions</h3>
<p>Five Principles Determined; Implementation Can Be Done Within Days</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun, the acting mayor of this city, visited Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, a few days ago to discuss the issue of implementing drug prohibition in the Public Concession. The cooperation method has now been roughly agreed upon. It is reported that the principles are: ㊀ The Municipal Government entrusts the Public Works Bureau to handle drug prohibition in the Public Concession. ㊁ The Public Works Bureau establishes another office specifically responsible for this matter, and the Municipal Government recommends officials to assist in the work, but the full authority still belongs to the Public Works Bureau. ㊂ Opium prohibition licenses are modeled after the Municipal Police Bureau style. ㊃ The funding problem, if it is not enough, will be subsidized by the Municipal Government as appropriate. ㊄ Captured opium offenders will be sent to the Caohejing Prison. It is said that the above five measures have been approved by the Public Works Bureau and will be implemented within days.</p>
<h3>Person in Charge of the Municipal Government Discusses Flour Exchange to Prevent Control by Non-Industry Players</h3>
<p>Explanation of the Review Opinions of the Municipal Council on the Twenty-Sixth Year Budget</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the Municipal Council's review of the Municipal Budget for the Twenty-Sixth Year, the person in charge of the Municipal Government made the following statement yesterday: "After reviewing the opinions of the Provisional Municipal Council on the budget for the 26th year of this city, as reported in the newspapers of this city the other day, it said, 'Among the expenditures of various agencies, salaries account for 53.11% and office and other expenses account for 46.89%. In contrast, the cost of business construction, such as road repair costs, accounts for only 1.5% of the total annual expenditure. The proportions seem to be disparate.' The standards for calculation seem to have errors, resulting in percentage ratios that do not match the actual situation. For fear of misunderstandings, the explanations are as follows:"</p>
<p>㊀ The original review opinion stated that the construction costs for projects, such as road repairs, only accounted for 1.5% of the total annual expenditure, which refers to the Engineering and Maintenance Costs in Item 8, Section 2 of the annual current budget. According to past precedents, this maintenance fee is designated for daily small repairs to roads, ditches, bridges, revetments, etc. If there are major repairs and construction projects, special appropriations have been made in the past, which are not within this 1.5% range. If this number is referred to as the entire construction cost of the city and its percentage is calculated, it is easy to cause misunderstandings.</p>
<p>㊁ The subjects listed in the municipal budget are compiled according to the "Standards for the Classification of Budget Revenue and Expenditure". If they are classified according to the nature of "business construction costs", then all items related to the promotion of municipal construction, such as the Public Works Bureau in charge of city-wide engineering, and the Municipal Central District Construction Committee, the Municipal Central District Construction Cost Protection Committee, the Wusong River Dredging Fee, the Level Crossing Maintenance Fee (Section 8 of the current annual budget), the Bureau of Social Affairs in charge of city-wide industry, commerce, education, and culture (Items 12 to 14 of Section 1, Items 1 to 5 and Section 6 of Section 5), the Bureau of Health in charge of city-wide public health (Section 7 of the budget), and the Bureau of Public Utilities in charge of city-wide street lights, water and electricity, and land and water transportation (Items 16 to 20 of Section 1), as well as libraries, museums, and stadiums for cultural construction (Items 9 to 11 of Section 5 of the budget) and other expenses, all fall within the scope of "business construction costs". Other expenses, such as public security expenses, are also an important expenditure of urban administration, accounting for 35.57% of the expenses of various agencies, and the expenses of other agencies account for only 19.23%.</p>
<p>㊂ As for salaries, office expenses, etc., it should be determined according to the nature of their use. If they are set up to handle matters related to "business construction", then their nature should also belong to the "business construction cost" item. If the same numbers in the "subjects" of salaries, office expenses, etc. in the budget are summarized and their percentages are calculated, it is very confusing. That is, according to what the original review opinion said, salaries account for 53.11% of the expenses of various agencies, and after analysis, the salary of the military and police agencies should be classified as public security expenses, accounting for 28.78%, and the salary that should be classified as the above-mentioned business construction cost item accounts for 12.86%, and the salaries of other agencies account for only 11.47%. The Municipal Government has decided to implement austerity measures in order to reorganize finances and has prepared the annual budget accordingly.</p>
<h3>Flour Exchange Prevents Manipulation by Outsiders</h3>
<p>Supervisory Staff Summon Directors; Will Investigate Multiple Accounts</p>
<p>The flour and wheat market has been turbulent. It is reported that the supervisors of the exchange are afraid that there will be multiple operators outside the industry and will also investigate the accounts of the brokers in the exchange. The Board of Directors of the Flour Exchange is currently seeking instructions on how to deal with the situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Prevent Skyrocketing</p>
<p>The flour and wheat market skyrocketed several times last week. Although additional security deposits were added, the rise was not suppressed. The auction was suspended due to incomplete follow-up evidence and will not be opened until July 3. In order to prevent the market price from soaring again, the Board of Directors of the Exchange specifically visited Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, to explain the process of the market price soaring, and proposed to set a price limit. Before the rise is extinguished, the market price of each session shall not exceed the closing price of June 26. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has formally requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to verify the matter. Once approved, it will be officially ordered by the Exchange to comply.</p>
<p>Investigate Accounts</p>
<p>Yu Kaizhan, the supervisor of the Shanghai Exchange, summoned Gu Xinyi and Jin Runzhao, two directors of the Flour Exchange, on the morning of the 30th because the flour and wheat market was surging and was afraid that multiple operators outside the industry were manipulating the market. He inquired about the recent situation of the exchange and instructed them to send personnel to the exchange on July 3 to investigate the accounts of the multiple brokers in the exchange. It is reported that the Board of Directors of the Exchange will be formally ordered within days to order the multiple brokers to comply.</p>

<p>Letter to the Municipal Council</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: Regarding the new cattle and sheep transit tax ordinance issued by your Municipal Council last year, our association has repeatedly sent letters through the City Chamber of Commerce and the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association to negotiate, detailing the cruelty of this tax regulation, which damages national rights and harms both businesses and people, requesting its cancellation. After more than a year of running around and appealing, your Municipal Council has ignored legal principles and public opinion, and stubbornly persisted in its own way. As a result, our industry has suffered extra burdens and considerable losses over the years. If this continues, our industry will be exploited and face various difficulties, inevitably leading to extinction. The reason for your Municipal Council's new tax, according to your reply to the municipal government, is purely to prevent traffic obstacles and other malpractices caused by the transit of livestock. Regardless of whether this reason is the true intention of your Municipal Council's new tax, even if it were true, you cannot suddenly create this unreasonable cattle and sheep transit tax. Moreover, what you say is just a pretext to cover up the facts, and your intention is to use this to force our industry to slaughter cattle and sheep entirely at your Municipal Council's slaughterhouse. Everyone knows your intentions. Our industry is deeply concerned and fully aware. There are many ways for your Municipal Council to improve the slaughterhouse business and make it more prosperous. Why resort to such coercive measures and provoke resentment from our industry? Now you insist on seeking the prosperity of the slaughterhouse business by imposing unbearable burdens and unreasonable taxes on our exhausted industry. This is not the way to maintain your Municipal Council's slaughterhouse business, but to move towards extinction together. People's lives are at stake, how can you be so reckless? Our industry, unable to endure it any longer, in addition to submitting a proposal to the 8th Members' Congress of the City Chamber of Commerce to request the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward a letter to the French Ambassador to negotiate for the prompt cancellation of this illegal tax, also convened a general meeting of all industry member representatives on the 30th of this month. It was resolved that starting from July 1, your Municipal Council must approve the cancellation of the cattle and sheep transit tax and stop issuing compulsory pre-purchase inspection tickets every month, otherwise we will unanimously stop slaughtering cattle and sheep at your Municipal Council's slaughterhouse, which is hereby recorded. Therefore, we send this letter, hoping that your Municipal Council will carefully consider it and promptly cancel this illegal tax, so as to avoid extreme measures and move towards extinction together. Furthermore, we must inform your Municipal Council that this resolution represents the will of all members of our industry, and no one holds a dissenting opinion. People are not foolish, and they will never rashly make meaningless sacrifices unless they are subjected to intolerable oppression. We hope that your Municipal Council will understand this unavoidable action, adopt public opinion, and restore business as soon as possible. We sincerely hope for this. To the French Concession Municipal Council, from the Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Industry Association.</p>

<h3>Labor Representatives of Labor-Capital Arbitration Committee Reinstated</h3>
<p>Twenty-Four People Including Zhu Xuefan Have Been Approved by the Ministry of Industry for Record</p>
<p>The final arbitration body for handling labor-capital disputes in this city has always been the organization of the Labor-Capital Arbitration Committee. However, due to the peaceful labor situation in recent years, even if there are occasional labor-capital disputes, they are resolved after the Social Affairs Bureau mediates them according to law, so the work of the committee has been suspended in an invisible way. Since this year, due to the slight upturn in the market and the improvement in the business of various industries, the price index has gradually risen, and the workers in various industries have demanded improvement of treatment, which has led to an irrepressible wave of labor disputes. The Shanghai General Labor Union, in order to seek to eliminate the situation, once submitted a request to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Department to restore the arbitration committee and implement compulsory arbitration as a remedy. The proposal was adopted. The selection of arbitrators was ordered by the Municipal Government to be recommended by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the capital side. As for the labor side, the Municipal Party Department has appointed Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Shao Lubai, Lan Peiyun, Zhang Kechang, Shui Xiangyun, Long Yuting, Fan－Feng, Liu Jintai, Li Hua, Ding Changyan, Lu Keming, Long Pixiong, Su Shaotao, Liu Xinquan, Chen Xiupu, Lou Jingguan, Lu Muqin, Bao Boyi, Zhu Weichang, Shen Jiabin, Hu Menglin, Weng Shanhe, and twenty-four others. The selection was approved by the 261st Standing Committee Meeting and approved by the Municipal Government in Public Letter No. 715, and the Ministry of Industry in Letter No. 6014 approved the filing.</p>

<h3>Merchant Marine Alumni Association's Defense of Marine Engineer Qualifications</h3>
<p>Re: Zhaoshangju's Cai Zengji</p>
<p>Recently, the state-owned Zhaoshangju published a letter to all marine engineers, which the engineers felt was inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, the Merchant Marine Alumni Association sent a letter to Zhaoshangju to defend them. The original letter is recorded below: To the esteemed sir, regarding the third point in your bureau's announcement, as published in the June 19th Shen Bao, concerning the three reasons for the salary disparity between deck officers and marine engineers due to the marine engineers' request for higher pay, which states, "Those from schools possess better knowledge, but often focus on theory and lack experience. Furthermore, due to their unfamiliarity with practical operations, they cannot personally perform tasks, which affects work efficiency." Upon reading this, the marine engineers of our association were shocked and dismayed. It is regrettable that such untrue remarks appeared in your bureau's public announcement. Upon investigation, the years of study for marine engineers and deck officers in our association are the same. Both undergo two years of classroom instruction and two years of practical training. After completing four years of study, they must pass the Ministry of Transportation's rigorous examination. Only those with both excellent knowledge and experience can be issued a diploma by the school and a Class A engineer certificate by the Ministry of Transportation. Since their academic qualifications are equal and their qualifications are the same, the disparity in salary is unfair. Our members, being graduates of schools, are confident that they can balance both knowledge and experience. During the two years of schooling, they have thoroughly studied marine engineering courses. During the two years of practical training, work experience is particularly emphasized. Moreover, theory is the accumulation of experience, and thorough theory is the purification of experience. The original letter states that those from schools often focus on theory and lack experience, but we do not know on what basis this is said. Furthermore, upon investigation, the marine engineers of our association who are currently serving in your bureau are all dedicated and hardworking. The chief engineers of various ships rely on them heavily. For example, the second engineers of the Hai Yuan, Hai Li, Hai Zhen, Hai Heng, Jiang Hua, and Xin Jiang Tian, among others, are not only competent but also have outstanding performance. Your bureau should commend this manifestation of facts to provide encouragement. Now, the drafter of the original letter, being unaware of the facts, falsely accuses them of being unfamiliar with operations and unable to personally perform tasks, etc., and we do not know what this refers to, which is puzzling. Also, the last paragraph of the letter to marine engineers states, "... At the same time, personnel from specialized schools must have considerable experience before they can enjoy the highest treatment that can be given in practice..." The knowledge and experience of the marine engineers in our association are very rich, as we have stated in great detail before. Moreover, when marine engineers of our association enter your bureau, they must start as third engineers, then second engineers, then first engineers, and then chief engineers. The time it takes is at least six years. Their skills and experience must be proficient and abundant. Your bureau claims that considerable experience is required before enjoying the highest treatment that can be given in practice. Such vague regulations are deeply dissatisfying. The general relationship between the members of our association and your bureau has always been very harmonious. This time, the erroneous views in the published announcement have caused resentment among the members. This measure of your bureau lacks thorough consideration. The marine engineers of our association are the rising stars of the marine engineering field, and they are striving for improvement and making efforts to be successful. It seems that they should not be given unreasonable blows, which would be a disservice to the Ministry of Transportation's intention to run schools for cultivation. For the sake of the future careers of our members and the reputation of society, our association dares to present this defense, hoping for your understanding and correction, so as to correct public opinion and clarify the situation. We also request a reply. We are eagerly awaiting it. Respectfully to Cai, General Manager of the State-Owned Zhaoshangju, from the Wusong Merchant Marine Alumni Association of the Ministry of Transportation, June 28th.</p>

<h3>Zhongxing Steamship Company Officially Opens Today</h3>
<p>Sixteen Vessels Mainly Transporting Coal, Shipping Schedule to Be Determined in the Future</p>
<p>The Zhongxing Coal Mining Company's original ships were managed by the shipping section of the Zhongxing Coal Mining Company's operations office for all shipping matters. It is now known that in order to facilitate management and develop the shipping industry, the steamship portion has been separated to establish the Zhongxing Steamship Company, operating independently. 1.5 million yuan has been converted into the company's capital. The inaugural meeting has already been held some time ago, electing directors and supervisors, and hiring a deputy manager to be responsible for everything. It is now scheduled to officially start operations today. The company has seven new-style giant ships ranging from 3,000 to 7,000 tons, six iron barges, and three tugboats, totaling 16 vessels. Therefore, it has considerable strength in shipping. However, at present, the main business is still to transport coal for Zhongxing Company, traveling to ports in Japan, Annam, and major ports along the coast and the Yangtze River. If there are foreign customers delivering passengers and goods, they will also be accepted. After a solid foundation is gradually established in the future, it will proceed with planning and setting shipping schedules to transport passengers and goods.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Ye Fukan's Fraud Case Overturned by Higher Court</h3>
<p>Part of the Embezzlement of Wang Hanqing's Deposit Not Accepted</p>
<p>Lawyer Ye Fukan was previously sued by Wang Hanqing in the Shanghai District Court for fraud. He was sentenced to imprisonment. Ye refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Jiangsu Higher Court. Chief Judge Zhu Zongzhou, Assessors Zhang Bingci, and Zhang Zefu reviewed the case file. Without summoning both parties for questioning, they determined that the original trial court had violated the law. Therefore, on June 3rd, they announced the judgment. The judgment is as follows:</p>
<p>The above appellant, because of the embezzlement case, refused to accept the first instance judgment of the Shanghai District Court on April 10, 1937. This court's judgment is as follows: Main text: The original judgment regarding Ye Fukan's crime and punishment is revoked. Ye Fukan's prosecution for embezzlement of Wang Hanqing's deposit is not accepted. Reason: According to the old Criminal Procedure Law, Article 347, Paragraphs 1 and 3, the private prosecutor may withdraw the case before the conclusion of the first instance debate. After the private prosecution is withdrawn, it may not be re-sued or reported. The current Criminal Procedure Law, Article 317, Paragraph 4, also stipulates that a person who has withdrawn a private prosecution may not re-sue or report or request. In this case, the original private prosecutor Wang Hanqing filed a private prosecution with the Shanghai First Special District Court on May 11, 1933, against Ye Fukan for fraud. He then submitted a petition to withdraw it on the 22nd of the same month. The court ruled that the case was not accepted. Although fraud is not a crime that is prosecuted only upon reporting or requesting, it is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 317, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which stipulates that the private prosecutor may withdraw the case. However, Wang Hanqing's withdrawal of the private prosecution was during the effective period of the old Criminal Procedure Law, and the judgment of the First Special District Court that the case was not accepted has already been finalized. Its effectiveness should not be lost due to the retroactive implementation of the new Criminal Procedure Law. Therefore, in September 1936, the private prosecutor Wang Hanqing again filed a complaint with the Judicial Yuan based on the "facts." The Yuan instructed the Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu Higher Court to transfer the case to the Chief Prosecutor of the original court for investigation and response. The prosecutor of the original court actually re-investigated the fact that the private prosecution had already been withdrawn and filed a public prosecution. If it is said that the prosecutor's prosecution of the crime does not depend on a legitimate report or request, nor is it bound by the withdrawal of the private prosecution, then Article 335 of the Criminal Procedure Law clearly stipulates the private prosecution procedure. Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, the provisions of Sections 2 and 3 of the previous chapter shall apply. Article 249 in Section 2 of the previous chapter states that "the withdrawal of the prosecution has the same effect as a non-prosecution disposition, and Article 239 shall apply." Since that article belongs to the scope of private prosecution, then the withdrawal of the private prosecution is not under the circumstances listed in the various clauses of Article 239 of the same law, that is, the prosecution may not be re-filed. The original prosecutor in this case started the investigation based on Wang Hanqing's submission to the Judicial Yuan. After reviewing the submission, it was roughly the same as the private prosecution filed in the First Special District Court last year. No new facts or new evidence were discovered, nor were there any statutory reasons for a retrial. Then, the re-filing of the prosecution violated the law. It is very clear. The original trial did not review whether the prosecution procedure was legitimate first, but accepted it and made a substantive ruling. It was even more erroneous. The appellant's intention is to request that the original judgment be revoked and a judgment of non-acceptance be rendered, which cannot be said to be unreasonable. Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 361, Paragraph 1, Article 356, and Article 295, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3>Cruel Stepmother Drives Away Young Child</h3>
<p>Entire Family Moves Elsewhere, Child Homeless</p>
<p>Zhu Qinxiung, a ten-year-old boy from Ningbo, lived at No. 4, Yuqing Lane, Roberts Road, West Shanghai. At around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, he was wandering and crying in the Wujiaochang area of Caojiadu for a long time without leaving. He was seen by Liu, the policeman at post No. 7 there, who immediately went forward to inquire. According to him, he was driven out by his stepmother and is now homeless, which is why he was crying. Policeman Liu brought Qinxiung back to the police station. According to the child, he is the son of Zhu Shide, the grandson of the late Ningbo merchant Zhu Baosan in Shanghai. He was driven out by his stepmother at 9:00 AM. Because he was hungry all day and had nowhere to stay, he still intended to return home at around 11:00 PM that night. Unexpectedly, after arriving home, he learned that the whole family had moved during the day and did not know where they had gone, so he was crying there, etc. Under questioning by the police officer, because the matter was bizarre, detective Gu Shendu was sent to investigate. It was confirmed that they had moved. The neighbors also said the same thing. He returned to the station and reported the investigation. The police officer thought that the stepmother's driving away her children was too cruel. Perhaps there was another hidden reason, so he ordered a document to be transferred to the main office for disposal.</p>
<h3>Two Robberies Occurred on Xinzha Road Within Two Hours</h3>
<p>One Bamboo Shop and One Exchange, Losses Exceeding 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>At 8:10 PM the night before last, four bandits suddenly came to Changshun Bamboo Shop, located at the north exit of Wenzhou Road on Xinzha Road in the Public Concession (along the Suzhou River). Three were wearing short shirts and trousers made of blue coarse cloth, one was wearing black short shirts and trousers, and they spoke with a Jiangbei accent. First, one bandit broke in, showing a pistol to scare them into silence. Then, two bandits went straight upstairs, forcing them to hand over the silver box key. Another bandit guarded the door, also holding a pistol in his hand. They ransacked the place, searching for silver notes and small bills, totaling more than 900 yuan, two gold buttons on their clothes, one inlaid gemstone ring, one gold ring, one watch, etc., worth more than 1,000 yuan in total. The robbery lasted about 45 minutes. After the robbery, the bandits used a vegetable basket to put the stolen silver notes and jewelry in the basket, covered with a towel, and fled. Afterwards, the shop owner Cai Zhongxi ran to report to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives in patrol cars. The bandits had already disappeared. It was learned that the shop was about to settle accounts with Japan, so it had such a large sum of money. Unexpectedly, before the police station's patrol car returned for a long time, at about 10:00 PM, at the west end of that place, at the intersection of Park Road (commonly called the opposite of Triangle Field), at Dechang Exchange, which has three bays, just after closing, four bandits wearing long clothes also came. The first bandit wore a snuff-colored long gown, a white straw hat, one bandit wore a raincoat, and two bandits wore black long gowns. Each held a pistol. First, they drove the people in the store to the west side of the counter downstairs. One bandit guarded the main door, and two bandits searched the accounting tables on the east and west sides. Because the store usually has precautions, the upstairs had already learned when the bandits entered the door, shouting "Robbers!" and blowing police whistles, causing the bandits to panic. They were unable to search and only took away 121 yuan, 124 jiao, and silver dimes in banknotes from the accounting tables. The three bandits fled one after another, and the bandit wearing the snuff-colored long gown was the first to enter and the last to escape. Afterwards, the owner of the exchange also reported to the Xinzha Police Station. After receiving the report, the police station was extremely surprised that two robberies had occurred in succession. They immediately sent Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. They are currently investigating and arresting.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Customs Reports Yichang Floodwaters Have Receded</h3>
<p>Hankou Water Level Also Reduced by Two Inches, Counties Along the River Begin Flood Control Today, Huangpu River Not Affected by Yangtze River Flood</p>
<p>The Yangtze River flood, according to a report received yesterday by the Customs from Yichang in the middle reaches, the water level has dropped sharply, but the situation in the lower reaches is still tight. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yichang Water Recedes</p>
<p>According to the Yichang water level report received by the Shanghai Customs yesterday, it has dropped to 19 feet 5 inches. The highest water level in Yichang was on the 18th of last month, reaching 29 feet 3 inches. Compared with yesterday's water level, it has dropped by more than 10 feet. Therefore, all those concerned about the Yangtze River flood situation must be rejoicing at this news.</p>
<p>Han River Slightly Reduced</p>
<p>However, the Hankou water level, according to the report received by the Customs, is still from the 28th of last month, measured at 40 feet 5 inches, which is also reduced by 2 inches compared with the 27th. However, since the water level in the middle reaches has dropped dramatically, the Hankou water level is expected to decline in the coming days. As for the water levels in Jiujiang, Anqing, Wuhu, and Zhenjiang, there is still no sign of shrinking.</p>
<p>Start Flood Control</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Province Jiangnan Water Conservancy Office has ordered all counties along the river to start flood control from today. The flood season is approaching in an instant. The county magistrates of Baoshan, Taicang, and other counties in Shanghai personally inspect the embankment and seawall projects to see if there are any leaks, in order to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Huangpu River Unaffected</p>
<p>During this Yangtze River flood season, whether the Huangpu River will be affected is also a matter that residents of this port are eager to know. According to the opinion of the Dredging Bureau yesterday, there is no need to worry. Because Wusongkou, outside, is the tail of the Yangtze River estuary. The Yangtze River water discharge, if not subject to a strong wind attack, rarely rolls into the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Huzhou Kidnapping Case Criminal Permitted to Be Transferred</h3>
<p>Gui Xu, a widow from Huzhou, lives at No. 5, Wangjia Lane, in the city of her hometown, living in the same house as her uncle Gui Luchen. She has a son, Shunkang, who is eight years old. In the meantime on the 17th of last month, Shunkang was studying at Chaoyang Primary School there. He was brought to Shanghai by his sister-in-law Gui Xu on the pretext of going to Shanghai for a wedding banquet. He first went to Sun Zukun, a Yongren at No. 127, Tonglefang, Jining Road, who instigated him to carry out the kidnapping. He drafted two letters and had Gui Xu copy them. He delivered them to Gui Luchen, demanding 15,000 yuan. Shunkang was hidden in the Pang family's little sister's house at No. 16, Caojiazhai, Caojiadu, waiting for news. The case was detected by the detectives of the Sixth District Police Branch in the Chinese area, and Gui Xu was arrested. They recovered the child Shunkang, and together with the Yulin Road Police Station, sent detective Zhao Ziren secretly to arrest Sun and send him to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieffen presided over the interrogation in the Third Criminal Court. Police Station lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the Municipal Police Bureau has not yet officially announced the transfer, and he does not object to the transfer. The defendant denied that he had drafted the ransom letter. Judge Xiao instructed that Sun Zukun be allowed to be transferred after the official letter from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau arrives at the court.</p>
<h3>Qu Binggen Sentenced to Six Years for Rape Case</h3>
<p>Surrendered to Hear the Verdict, Immediately Taken into Custody</p>
<p>Qu Binggen, a local from No. 2, Qiuchuanwan, Yinhang Town, Jiangwan, on September 16th of last year, in the fields behind Maojiazhai, stopped Zhao Di, the 20-year-old adopted daughter-in-law of his neighbor Luo Gongshi, and committed adultery in the field.

It was found that Qu had paid 800 yuan for bail. He surrendered to hear the verdict and was taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Dai Dunrong Commits Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>Young Couple Was Extremely Loving, Committed This Desperate Act Due to Stimulation</p>
<p>Young Dai Dunrong, at 1:00 AM the day before yesterday, at the Guangdong Road pier, unloaded a fake gray woolen long gown and a white fu gang short shirt, and then threw himself into the Huangpu River and died. Inside his clothes, there were two photos, one of a man and one of a woman. On the back of the woman's photo, it was written "Died for you." The Central Police Station of the Public Concession turned the relics over to the Water Patrol Police Station to investigate and claim them. It was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been learned that the deceased in this case did not take this desperate act because of heartbreak. He was 26 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at No. 3, Ruxin Lane, Xiaobeimen. His father's name is Maolin, and he works at Jardine Matheson. Dai once studied at Minli Middle School and later specialized in English. His father recommended him to work as a clerk in the shipping department of Jardine Matheson. He married at the age of 22. His wife's name is Chuan Yizhen, and she is 22 years old this year. She is from the same hometown as Dai. Because she is lively and gentle, the young couple was extremely loving. The next year, she gave birth to a son, who died soon after. However, his mother-in-law and Dai had different opinions. Last year, Yizhen returned to her parents' home and never returned. The mother had repeatedly urged her son-in-law to remarry. At around 5:00 PM on the 28th, Dai finished his work in the writing room and returned home. His mother-in-law was already there. The two argued for a long time. After the mother-in-law left, Dai left home at around 10:00 PM. After a while, his father received a phone call from him, saying that he would wander to other places and would never return home in this life. When his father tried to persuade him, the phone had already been hung up. But at this time, Dai had walked to the Jardine Matheson Wharf in the French Concession to meet a friend on the Hunan ship. He wanted to buy green bean liquor to relieve his boredom and talked about how boring it was to be a human being and that he would throw himself into the Huangpu River and commit suicide. His friends thought it was just drunken talk and did not pay attention to it. Unexpectedly, it became a reality. As for the photos he left behind, the man was his portrait and the woman was his wife. The day before yesterday evening, Yizhen learned of the bad news at her mother's house and ran to her husband's house to cry bitterly. Dai's parents also wept incessantly. After being persuaded by others, they stopped. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Dai's father went to the Water Patrol Police Station himself to retrieve the relics and hired a boat to salvage the body.</p>

The number of staff along the road will be expanded from July to allocate them.</p>
<p>Hospital Opening Postponed</p>
<p>This year, because the weather is cooler and there are fewer hot days, the opening time of the epidemic hospitals is also later. For example, the North Xizang Road Emergency Epidemic Hospital (the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yu Qiaqing Road is scheduled to open tomorrow) and the free epidemic departments attached to the Zhabei and Nanshi hospitals have been postponed to open after July 1st. Most of them will be opened between July 10th and 15th, and all will be delayed compared to last year.</p>

<h3>Honors of Weng Shanggong, Overseas Chinese Aviator in Japan</h3>
<p>Weng Shanggong, an overseas Chinese businessman from Fujian residing in Japan, entered aviation school at the age of fifteen and after three years of practical training, returned to China to apply to a military academy, where he served as a cadet for four years. He then went to Japan again for further study at an aviation school. In April 1936, among the twenty-eight pilots selected for testing across Japan, Weng was ranked first among the five who passed, greatly adding glory to the nation. The school principal, taking pride in this achievement, appointed him as an instructor at the school. It is noted that among aviation students studying in Japan, Weng is the only one who has been valued by the Japanese and has served as an instructor at the school. In September of the same year, he further responded to a special aerobatic flight test by the Japanese government's Aviation Department, performing stunning stunts such as somersaults, barrel rolls, side slips, and falling-leaf maneuvers, earning unanimous praise from the Japanese. Not content with this, Weng continued to work hard and applied for the highest-level pilot selection test. All five candidates were renowned Japanese aviators. Weng was one of only two who passed the test. Weng's score was the highest record in the aviation community studying in Japan, truly an honor for our country. Furthermore, Weng performed parachute jumps at the Suzaki airfield in Fukagawa Ward, Tokyo, in November 1935, and performed and tested parachute performance at the Funabashi airfield in Chiba in February 1937, with excellent results. This time, he returned to China to survey aviation routes and plans to undertake an international flight in the near future.</p>

<h3>Huang Chunsheng's Estranged Wife Sues for Alimony Due to Infatuation with Dancer</h3>
<p>Requesting a Lump Sum Payment of 18,000 Yuan. Defendant's Whereabouts Unknown, Service by Public Notice Will Be Used.</p>
<p>Huang Chunsheng, formerly residing at No. 42 Xinmin Village, Malan Road, and who previously worked as a translator in the French Police Court Special No. 2 Court Bailiff's Office, had a dispute with his wife, Huang Chen Ruifen (36 years old, local, currently residing at No. 43 Caishi Road). His wife filed a case in the Special No. 2 Court requesting mediation for cohabitation and living expenses. Now, Huang's wife, Huang Chen Ruifen, is suing Huang again because he has stopped providing living expenses and</p>
<p>Abandoned Her.</p>
<p>Therefore, she has hired four lawyers, Jiang Yiping, Wu Baotai, He Xianzhang, and Li Gengxiang, to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Huang Chunsheng of intentionally abandoning her and requesting a judgment for alimony in a lump sum payment of 18,000 yuan. The complaint states that the plaintiff married the defendant sixteen years ago and has a daughter named Zhao Di, who is thirteen years old, and another daughter named Yu Di, who is eight years old. However, the defendant, who possesses assets of several hundred thousand,</p>
<p>Became Lustful After Gaining Wealth.</p>
<p>Since 1927, he has been infatuated with a dancer and has disappeared without returning home. He has made excuses to quarrel and has often resorted to violence. He has previously filed lawsuits in both the Court and the Provisional Court, which were mediated, resulting in a settlement agreement for him to pay 100 yuan per month for living expenses and to cohabit. However, after the mediation, the defendant has neither returned home to cohabit nor provided living expenses. Furthermore, he has taken the liberty to dispose of</p>
<p>All Property</p>
<p>On Caishi Road, colluding with others to force them to relocate. Living expenses have not been paid for a long time. Therefore, she requests a judgment ordering a one-time payment of 18,000 yuan. According to the court, on the morning of yesterday, Judge Li Liang summoned the defendant in Civil Chamber 7. As the defendant's whereabouts are unknown and he cannot be served, only the plaintiff and her lawyers appeared in court, recounting the previous circumstances and requesting service by public notice. After reviewing the situation, the court granted the request and rescheduled the hearing for the morning of July 28th.</p>

<h3>Xin Jiang and Tian Xing Collide. Ningbo Native Place Association Requests Severe Punishment.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Maritime Administration Bureau requesting punishment of the captains. The association could not remain silent due to its position as a fellow native place organization.</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau yesterday regarding the collision between the Xin Jiang and Tian Xing vessels, stating: "We are writing to inform you that, as reported in the newspapers, the Xin Jiang and Tian Xing vessels collided twice within the Zhenhai port at approximately 5:00 AM on the 23rd of this month due to racing to be the first to sail to Ningbo. Although fortunately no disaster occurred, the situation at the time was quite serious. After learning of this, our association is deeply saddened by this incident. Protecting the safety of travelers is a creed that must be strictly followed in the shipping industry. The captain is responsible for the safety of the passengers on board.  Normally, how should one be loyal to their duty and ensure safety?  However, this unnecessary racing behavior led to this collision, which is a serious dereliction of duty and a treatment of passengers' lives as a child's play. As a fellow native place organization, our association, while it should remain silent on this unfortunate event, hereby writes to request that you investigate and make a decision promptly, severely investigate and handle the matter without any leniency, and also request that you inform each shipping bureau to warn its affiliates not to allow similar incidents to occur to ensure passenger safety.  This is a matter of public concern."  There were also letters sent to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Sanpei Company, requesting warnings to the shipowners. The content of these letters is the same and will not be recorded separately.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>A Word for Our Female Compatriots Striving for Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>— Xiao Mei</p>
<p>Since the Third Plenary Session passed the date for convening the National Assembly, and the National Government announced the revised organizational and electoral laws for the National Assembly, the election campaign for National Assembly representatives has once again become active. In the women's sphere, because "the number of our 200 million female compatriots elected as representatives is a small minority of the minority, accounting for only one or two tenths," they are taking advantage of the amendment to the electoral law, which includes "an increase of 240 representatives appointed by the government," to "earnestly request that the number of female representatives be increased as much as possible among the 240 designated representatives so that the results can be fair, and the National Assembly can be supported by our country's 200 million female compatriots." This movement has been developing in recent days. According to newspaper reports, women's organizations in this city have not only held joint meetings but have also issued declarations and telegrams. At the joint meetings, they have also elected representatives to go to Beijing to attend the National Women's Representatives Conference to discuss matters. It seems that they are determined not to give up until they achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Since women are a part of the nation, their rights and obligations should naturally be absolutely equal to those of male citizens. "However, because traditional concepts have deeply ingrained themselves in people's minds, various treatments have not yet reached equality." Therefore, even today, although "the thoughts and learning of female compatriots have improved in recent years compared to the past, and their achievements in society" are "no less than those of men," the result is still the same: "various treatments have not yet reached equality." There is no other reason. In a word, it is: women are still in a subordinate position economically; since the economy is controlled by men, no matter how loudly the slogan of equality between men and women is shouted, "various treatments that have not yet reached equality" will continue.</p>
<p>However, not all men in the world are enemies of women. This is not difficult to find precedents in the history of women's movements in various countries in the past. Conversely, among women, there are those who use the masses as a ladder to achieve personal advancement. I dare not say there are, but I can't pat my chest and say there are absolutely none, right?</p>
<p>Naturally, if I say this, I will inevitably be suspected of supporting it in name but actually undermining it. To avoid this suspicion, then, I ask that the female councilors who are elected in the future do not regard women's attainment of full and equal citizenship as the ultimate goal. If this is the case, if the sexual slavery of women and the economic dependence of wives are not broken, then the female councilors may be "equal" to the male councilors, but it will still be of no benefit to the majority of women, and they will still be subject to "various treatments that have not yet reached equality." August Bebel said it well, "The improvement of the position of thousands of happy women can never improve the general state of all women." And the sisters who are now striving for constitutionalism are precisely "thousands of happy women." I hope that those who truly care about the women's movement will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Shouting</h3>
<p>— Luo Quan</p>
<p>People are like homeless dogs, tails between their legs, slinking down the street; but at any moment, their eyes might redden, revealing sharp teeth, and they'll tear into someone on the street, all for a small sum of money, a contradictory word, or accidentally bumping into each other. Then their faces are bruised, their hair torn out, or a piece of skin is ripped from their palm, bleeding freely, before they fish out a dirty, black handkerchief to bandage it, cursing a few words, spitting, and going their separate ways. This is my hometown.</p>
<p>Those people wear clogs all day long, flashlights stuck in their waistbands, trouser legs rolled up, with a small knife hidden in their socks. Looking at those pairs of ferocious faces, if they could, they would secretly do someone in a dark alley.</p>
<p>On the street, foreign firms, joint-stock companies, shops, and financial cooperatives take turns opening day and night shifts; the Taiwanese troupe's erhu pulls all the more vigorously from dusk onwards: the conversation room, however, sets up opium lamps for those abstaining from marriage, and for those who can't afford opium lamps, they administer morphine injections. People get used to "old stuff," and even talking feels superfluous.</p>
<p>On that island, there is bright sky, but also a vague shadow.</p>
<p>The family to the left of my house is a compradore and sundry goods merchant. Every time I pass that shop, I habitually nod to that pig-like local shop owner, but I never have any friendly greetings. And whenever I happen to look up and see that small wooden plaque that says "XXX籍民" (Resident of XXX Nationality), it always makes me feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Specializing in usury, calculating interest on a daily basis, turning a small loan into a large sum of principal and interest, and torturing poor debtors in the courtyard—this is the profession of the compradore and sundry goods merchant. This family may even perfunctorily pay the resident registration tax, but this family of five may not have been included in the city's total population.</p>
<p>A young wet nurse was sought out by such a family to take care of those two fat little pigs. I often see a small baby carriage being pushed down the road, and the wet nurse looks worried.</p>
<p>"Who told her to eat tears in such a family?"</p>
<p>When the wet nurse suffers grievances, she always secretly sheds tears and complains to people, but people blame her behind her back.</p>
<p>Finally, one day, the wet nurse was driven away by the mistress of the house. Afterwards, there were men's quarrels, malaria-like cries, and it seemed like furniture was being smashed and children were being beaten.</p>
<p>"That filthy thing, taking her in, taking her in... I don't care." The woman cried jealously.</p>
<p>Like all unpleasant neighborhood news, this small</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>disturbance makes people think of the most obscene side.</p>
<p>That very night, I jumped out of bed because of the sorrowful cries from the neighbor to the left. I went to the window on the left and saw a cruel punishment being carried out.</p>
<p>A person's feet were tied with ropes, and they were hung upside down. A whip was randomly lashed, and the person cried out like a pig being slaughtered, but all around was silent, without a sound.</p>
<p>In the dim light, the person's face was twisted, and it looked like the young wet nurse's husband, a poor debtor.</p>
<p>Those sorrowful cries made people's hearts race, and a fire of anger burned in their hearts, making their whole heart feel like it was about to explode.</p>
<p>I wanted to shout.</p>
<h3>A High Vocational School Graduate Appeals to the Education Authorities</h3>
<p>— Jiang Peizu</p>
<p>I am a graduate of a high vocational school, and I am suffering from the dual pain of unemployment and the limited number of schools available for further study. I am appealing to the education authorities. Unemployment is, of course, inevitable under the current morbid social system, and the education authorities also feel helpless, because it is a comprehensive social problem that cannot be solved in an instant. Therefore, although we are eager for this issue to be addressed, we have to temporarily set it aside. What I want to appeal for now is the problem of applying to schools, which is something the education authorities can do. Currently, many schools do not allow our high vocational school graduates to apply. Therefore, I have the following three questions regarding these schools.</p>
<p>First, in terms of academic level, since the entrance exam questions for schools are based on the textbooks of ordinary middle schools, then if our high vocational school graduate friends feel they have the equivalent level to take the exam, the school should allow it. If our applicants do not meet the standard, then of course their level is insufficient. But if they do meet the standard, doesn't that mean that the level of our admitted high vocational school friends is equal to that of the admitted ordinary middle school friends? I don't know what the reason is for those schools that restrict vocational school applications?</p>
<p>Second, in terms of academic qualifications, many schools, in order to prevent students from skipping grades, require a review of the graduation year. If the years are sufficient, they are allowed to take the exam, which is correct. But why do many schools not consider the years, but simply refuse to allow vocational school graduates to take the exam? I am a bit puzzled here.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of further education, what is studied in universities are specialized subjects that start from the beginning. Once our high vocational school graduate friends are admitted to a university, then these friends have the same foundation as ordinary middle school friends. With the same foundation, studying the same subjects, what difference is there between ordinary schools and vocational schools? Furthermore, many of our friends have a considerable understanding of what they want to study in university when they were in vocational school. In this way, it is naturally easier for them to study than for those who have never studied it before. Since it is easier, their grades will certainly not be poor. But these friends are now being deprived of even the right to take the exam, and I am really confused.</p>
<p>I do not understand educational principles, and I do not even understand everything about education, so I do not know if what I have said above is right or wrong. I am eagerly awaiting instructions from the education authorities. If the education authorities believe that what I have said is correct, then the exam period is now approaching, please quickly issue a notice to all universities and schools equivalent to universities, to change those regulations that restrict vocational school applications – it is harmless to receive the notice even for those that have already been changed – so that we can apply; on the other hand, if the education authorities believe that what I have said is incorrect, then please also quickly give us students who want to enter schools but cannot enter, a relief measure so that we have a path to enter. This is what we are waiting for, this is what we are eagerly waiting for!</p>
