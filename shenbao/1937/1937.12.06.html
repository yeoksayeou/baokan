<p>［華盛頓］關於遠東時局問題、倫敦方面傳出消息謂、英國對於日本所採取之態度、業已較爲堅决、有人並主張由關係各國共同有所表示、藉使日本明瞭歐美各國在遠東方面所保有之利益、並無放棄之意云云、美國海軍界人士獲悉之餘、表示滿意、而各該人士自中日爭端發生以還、原已主張出於强硬行動、甚至曾以在太平洋上實行封鎖爲言、此在外交界人士、則以爲關係各國出以共同表示一層、美國輿論界未必予以贊助、其理由有二、㊀美國東部某數州各報、雖多主張美國應與其他各國相互合作、但國內大多數人民依然奉孤立政策爲圭臬、㊁關於日軍所屬部隊昨在上海公共租界遊行、曁日軍在事變發生後、攔入美軍防區兩事、美國各報論調、雖均表示不滿、但國會人士類皆以爲衡諸美國在遠東方面所保有之利益、殊不值得干冒與日本發生衝突之危險、此外、關於德國駐中日兩國大使、與各該國負責當局進行談話一事、美國外交界人士均極爲重視、而在國務院當局之意、以爲九國公約簽字各國所進行之調解工作失敗之後、德國倘能有所成就、美國並不反對、質言之、中日兩國爭端一日有獲致解决之可能、美國卽一日不欲出而干預也、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>土貨大批運滬</h3>
<p>上海與長江各埠及津浦路南段京滬路沿綫交通、目前祇有南通一路、南通鎮江間交通、並未阻滯、惟難民人數過多、因徵調舟車輸送、小汽艇輪船班期無定、滬通間郵遞亦暢通、各埠運至南通轉往上海之郵包、日近千袋、南通揚州間郵件、均由郵政汽車分班送達、江北方面土貨、連日由運鹽河大批運抵天生港裝英義輪船運滬、鮮豬運在滬不便、均在天生港宰殺、剖腹剜凈內臟、整隻裝輪、港埠屠戶大忙每日屠宰之豬、多至五百餘隻、又天生港西碼頭開放為外國商輪停泊處、因旅客增多貨物運輸忙碌、天生港市面極繁盛、倍於平日、上海南通間電報直達水綫中斷、電報均由鎮江轉、現亦不通、目前對於江南各處電報均停、未及拍出之電、均郵寄鎮江轉發、江北各綫路刻亦因轉報忙碌不堪、（一日）</p>
<h3>雜糧業訂米分配零糶辦法</h3>
<p>法租界各米號派八千包　公共租界米號昨已復業</p>
<p>囤積居奇者已取銷售米權</p>
<p>法租界當局、對於界內食米之分配、及售賣、素持週密嚴厲態度、居民類都知之、但自實行派米制度以來、仍有少數居民及售米商人、觸犯定章、故再鄭重通吿、俾各充分明瞭情形、免蹈覆轍、現時法租界內米店、每家每次派米四十包、當以每人最多購拾斤之限度、如數零售完竣、每升限價八分半、各米店為職員留存之米量、亦以每人至多十斤為限、在派米及售米時、捕房方面皆派有巡捕在塲照料保護、如遇違反定章等情、卽予停業處分、在所派四十包米售罄後、法捕房卽行調查剩餘米糧、如該項米量超過留供米店職員食用應需之數、並有囤積居奇行為、則捕房將永遠取消其售米權利、—本月四日、已有維爾蒙路九十三號德豐米號、勞神父路一○三號志和米號、康悌路一三二號公大米號、及貝勒路六三三號公大第三分號四家、喪失售賣工部局米之權利、蓋德豐米號曾謊報無米後、經查明尚有三十包、共二千七百四十公斤、志和•公大•及公大第三分號•三家、則於四十包米售罄後、尚分別存有九百八十公斤•一千一百六十五公斤•一千九百六十公斤•不等、茲將昨日法租界分派雜糧業購米及公共租界米號復業情形誌下、</p>
<p>法界另行派米一次</p>
<p>雜糧業公會革一批抵滬之安南米二萬零一百包、分配辦法中、曾規定以八千包分派法租界萬昌•永大等二百家米號•辦理零糶、法公董局已與米號業公會商定、凡法租界二百號額內各米店、决以該項洋米另行派米一次、該會特發緊急通吿、凡法租界內各米號、於五日上午八時起至下午四時止、凖備貨款、隨帶車雜費十元、赴會填領購米申請書、逾時卽行截止、故前往繳款申請者、頗為踴躍、</p>
<p>公共租界米號復業</p>
<p>華南米業公會委託違孚洋行代購之第四批洋米三萬包、抵滬後、米號業公會卽派員於四日卸貨、先送法租界內二百家米號、當晚卽完全送竣、昨晨已經繼續運送公共租界內三百家米號、故碼頭保護及隨車押運、已改由英駐軍派英兵一小排担任、各米店領到該項洋米後、旋卽次第開市、辦理零糶、一般平民購米者甚多、各米號門前均極擁擠、當由巡捕房派中西巡補各一名、在各店門前維持秩序、</p>
<p>閉歇飯店逐漸復業</p>
<p>公共租界及法租界內、有一部份飯店及包飯作、前以三批洋米吿罄、四批洋米復在途中躭擱、致無法購到食米、不得不暫吿停業、茲以四批洋米已到、分發各店出售、且雜糧業訂購之安南米亦已運到、故均設法購買、停歇多日之飯店及包飯作、業已逐漸恢復營業、</p>
<p>國產食糧起運有待</p>
<p>雜糧豆米米號等三業公會會員米行號萬與豫•仁大•大成•等、向蘇浙兩省各地採辦鉅額食糧、經市商會及各公會發給證明文件、證明採辦之食糧、係調節滬市民食之用、各米行號均已派員前往採辦、因今年內地米麥等均吿豐收、頗易辦足、惟各縣政府以事關運糧出境、須請示省政府核准後方起運、</p>
<p>南市之米無法運出</p>
<p>在我軍未撤退時、運抵南市之國米、總約二萬担左右、因時間侷促、均存在船上無法卸貨、自經各米業團體請求法當局交涉放行後、業經法當局向日方數度交涉無效、事實上恐無放行之希望、各貨主之損失、當在國幣二十五萬元以上、但各貨主仍在作最後之設法中、</p>
<p>本市食用需米約數</p>
<p>昨向糧食界探悉、滬市過去所需之米、每日約一萬二千担、戰後因人口减少、减為七千担左右、自國米因交通梗阻無法運滬後、滬市民食、全賴洋米維持、今雖經華南米業公司及各糧食團體、向國外訂購洋米運滬調節、但各米店零糶購米者依然擁擠、故設法繼續訂購、以維滬市民食、</p>
<p>麵粉價格尚稱穩定</p>
<p>滬市小麥存貨甚為充足、由福新阜豐等紛粉廠趕製、目前二號粉批發價、每包國幣四元四角五分、四號粉批發價、每包國幣三元七角、頭號粉三號粉市上無貨、二四號粉存貨總約二十萬包左右、</p>
<h3>米店零糶數量不足</h3>
<p>未經帶捕根究　公會先予警吿</p>
<p>法租界白爾路南陽橋鐵門口米店、昨日午間十二時半、有住附近安納金路榮生里三號居民楊培之、前往糶得米一元、當時發覺米量短少、遂報吿該店門口值差巡捕、請將該店人帶入捕房、乃該捕認爲並不短少、楊卽將糶得之米、放置該處警亭、復往該管霞飛路捕房、旋由西捕核算、始悉該米店售米斤量、並不凖足、故由繙譯給以銅元三枚、以作補償米店售米不足之款、最後楊將購得之米、携往公共租界梅自克路𢢌益里五十二號樓上米號業同業公會、經負責者將米過量、則確有數量不足情事、惟以當時值差警務人員、未將該店經理或店夥帶入捕房、故决先予該米店警吿、並稱嗣後無論何家會員米店、有扣尅斤量、可將該店人帶同購得之米、交與本會立卽取銷登記米號號卡、停止派米營業、而按照規定另糶一元可得米凖確市秤十一斤十二兩、且極望市民檢舉、俾絕舞弊、</p>

<p>日軍發言人昨日（四日）接見新聞訪員時、曾代表日高級指揮發言、對於星期五日日軍由極司非而區調至虹口者所經過之各路上法租界與公共租界當局所施之防範、表示感忱、又曰、“諸君皆知當日軍進行之際、曾發生一不幸案件、惟日當局今視此案業已結束、日軍與工部局警務處之代表交換意見後、警務處已允竭其能力、防杜此類案件之重見矣、”</p>

<h3>Retreat of Lishui Frontline Leads to Urgent Situation in Jurong</h3>
<p>Our Troops Deploy Defensively in the Suburbs of the Capital; Main Force Concentrated Southeast of Zhenjiang; Jiangyin Blockade Line Unbreached</p>
<p>[Hankou] News received here today from Chinese sources indicates that Japanese troops advancing along the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal have crossed Liyang and Lishui, and are currently pressing towards Jurong, approximately 22 miles southeast of Nanjing. This morning, the sound of artillery fire was heard in Nanjing. At the same time, reports indicate that Chinese troops have deployed defensively in the suburbs of the capital, preparing for a major battle. The fall of the Jiangyin Fort and Danyang has been confirmed by the Chinese side. The main force of the Chinese army is currently concentrated southeast of Zhenjiang, with a division acting as a rearguard between Zhenjiang and Danyang. After the fall of Wuxi and Changzhou, the Jiangyin Fort was completely surrounded by Japanese troops. The Japanese army, with the aid of heavy artillery and tanks, broke through the Chinese defense line. Before withdrawing from the fort, Chinese troops destroyed all gun emplacements. It is reported that the artillery positions on the northern bank of the Yangtze River opposite the Jiangyin Fort are still holding firm, capable of thwarting Japanese warships attempting to breach the blockade line. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Glorious Sacrifice of Guangde Garrison</h3>
<p>[Hankou] After reinforcement of the Japanese forces in the Guangde area, they reoccupied Guangde and advanced westward. The Chinese garrison in the area, comprised of Sichuan troops, although lacking in technical equipment, bravely confronted the enemy, regarding death as their homecoming. Of the 1,800 strong force, nearly all were wounded or killed. Japanese aircraft continue to heavily bomb the Yangtze River defenses in the Jiangyin area. According to Chinese sources, although the water barriers have been damaged, the presence of a large number of mines in front of the barriers has prevented Japanese warships from crossing. Japanese troops advancing from Liyang are eyeing Jintan, and the Xing Tianwang Temple in Danyang is under threat. Due to transportation disruptions, detailed reports have not yet been received here. (National Maritime News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources, Guangde has been occupied after fierce attacks by the Okamoto, Takeshita, Nagano, and Yamada units, and the important rear base of Nanjing, Shuiyang Town, has been occupied, continuing the advance towards Wuhu. At the same time, the Ono and Noda units occupying Jintan are pressing towards Jurong, which is only ten miles from Nanjing.</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources, the elite Japanese troops advancing towards Jurong reached Wangcun, two kilometers outside the city, at 10:00 AM on the 4th, and engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops outside the city at 2:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Counterattack Nanjing on Zhejiang-Anhui Border</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to Chinese sources, Chinese troops on the Zhejiang-Anhui border have indeed been gradually advancing towards Changxing. At the same time, Chinese guerilla forces active near Yixing have posed a significant threat to Japanese troops attacking Lishui. The fighting on the Nanjing-Shanghai line is currently taking place fiercely near Baitu Town, southwest of Danyang. The defensive works of the Chinese army in that area are solid enough to prevent the Japanese advance. The Jiangyin Fortress has also fallen, but the blockade line had not been breached as of the evening of the 4th. Therefore, the Japanese Navy's activities still cannot go beyond Jiangyin. (Express News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>We are Determined to Defend the Capital to the Death</h3>
<p>[Hankou] According to those arriving here from Nanjing, although the Chinese troops are thinly clothed in this cold winter, they are all determined to defend the capital to the death. Defensive works have been built throughout the city, and many streets are piled with water pipes as obstacles. Troops are stationed everywhere. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>The Japanese transport ships Nissho Maru and Tateyama Maru arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 5th with military supplies. The Hoan Maru arrived with many boxes of ammunition, unloaded at the Osaka Wharf, and transferred to small steamships to be transported upstream of the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Recapture Changxing</h3>
<p>Wuxing is Now Surrounded By Us; Guangde Recaptured Three Times Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>External News: Our elite troops fiercely attacked Changxing, and also attacked Wuxing at Niudian Bridge, controlling Japanese communication lines. Changxing was recaptured at noon on the 3rd. The army entered the city, with cheering throughout the streets, greatly boosting our army's morale. They took advantage of the victory to advance south, launching a pincer attack on Wuxing with the western route army. Guerilla forces attacked in the east of the city, and Wuxing is now surrounded. External News: After Guangde fell on the 30th, it was recaptured by us on the 1st, and lost again the following day. It was recaptured again on the 4th, and invaded for the third time by Japanese troops in the afternoon. Our Deputy Commander Chen then strictly ordered a certain division to launch a fierce counterattack, and finally recaptured the area for the third time on the morning of the 5th. For a week, the Japanese and us have been in a back-and-forth, seesaw battle, with heavy losses on both sides.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plane Shot Down and Destroyed in Jintan</h3>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reports, "At 10:00 AM on the 27th, Lieutenant Commander Takahashi Nirokuro, Petty Officer Sugimoto Masao, and Aviationman First Class, flying together in a Navy plane, led a flight of accompanying aircraft to bomb the military stronghold of Jintan behind Nanjing. Unfortunately, the Tanaka aircraft was immediately set on fire by an enemy (referring to our troops) hit by a bullet, resulting in a glorious death. Lieutenant Tanaka was originally one of the leading bombing experts in the Naval Air Corps. Now, he has unfortunately died, leaving us in deep sorrow."</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Attempts to Open Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Route in War Zone</h3>

<h3>British Chargé d'Affaires Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Passes Through Guangzhou to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Encountered Multiple Japanese Aircraft En Route to Hong Kong; Demonstrated in the Sky but Did Not Drop Bombs</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] British Chargé d'Affaires Sir Archibald Clark Kerr arrived in Guangzhou from Hankou today, rested briefly at the British Consulate in Guangzhou, and after breakfast, took a car to Hong Kong. En route, they passed several Japanese bombers, which demonstrated in the sky for more than ten minutes but did not drop bombs or strafe. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The special diplomatic train carrying British Chargé d'Affaires Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, members of the British Embassy, and more than forty other foreigners arrived safely here at 11:20 this morning. This is the first leg of the journey for British Embassy personnel transferring from Hankou to Shanghai. According to passengers, after the train left Guangzhou, two Japanese aircraft flew above it along the way, but did not drop bombs. Japanese aircraft bombed the tracks before and after the train, but did not hit them. There were several foreign women and children, several sick naval soldiers, and several French citizens among the passengers. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr arrived in Guangzhou at 8:00 this morning, where he was greeted by the British Consul General and senior naval officers. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr will stay in Hong Kong for several days, which has not yet been decided. The journey from Hankou to Hong Kong took two days, and no accidents occurred along the way. The special train consisted of five passenger cars with large British emblems painted on the roofs. Preparations were also made to use gunboats to come to Hong Kong if the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was bombed and impassable. It is now believed that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and his entourage will take the Blue Funnel Line's Patroclus to Shanghai tomorrow, as their luggage has already been loaded onto the ship today.

<h3>Island Near Guangzhou Occupied</h3>

<h3>Japanese Troops Must Withdraw from China First Before Peace Negotiations Can Begin</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Expresses Firm Position; German Ambassador Returns to Hankou After Meeting with Chiang; No Essential Points Gained from the Meeting</p>
<p>[Hankou] The meeting between Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and German Ambassador Oskar Trautmann in Nanjing has concluded. Ambassador Trautmann is scheduled to return to Hankou today. It is reported that Chairman Chiang insisted that peace negotiations cannot begin as long as the Japanese military continues its armed pressure on China. It is said that Chiang suggested that Japanese troops should withdraw from China first before peace can be discussed. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] German Ambassador Dr. Oskar Trautmann returned here today with Vice Minister Xu Mo aboard a customs patrol boat after meeting with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing. Xu accompanied Dr. Trautmann to Nanjing. Both declined to disclose the details of the talks in Nanjing, but according to responsible sources, no essential points were gained from the talks. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] An editorial in today's Kokumin Shimbun criticized Germany's mediation of the Sino-Japanese conflict, stating that based on repeated statements by the Japanese government, Japan is prepared to consider mediation by a third party, provided that such mediation is based on friendly spirit and does not conflict with Japan's policy of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. However, it is doubtful whether Germany can handle the Far East issue independently without relying on Britain. Germany urgently needs Britain's cooperation on European issues. Britain has described Japan's actions in China as aggression. If the mediation method proposed by Germany follows British policy, then its efforts will ultimately fail. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Reuters learned today from responsible sources that the rumors that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has left Nanjing for Guling are unfounded. Liu and Chiang are still in Nanjing directing the war. Yesterday, an important military conference was held in Nanjing, chaired by Chairman Chiang. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Large Formation of Japanese Aircraft Attacks Nanjing</h3>
<p>Impoverished Areas from Outside Zhongshan Gate to Xihua Gate Street Devastated by Bombing, a Truly Heartrending Sight</p>
<p>External news: At 11:10 AM on the 5th, a large formation of Japanese aircraft attacked Nanjing, dropping more than twenty bombs and incendiary bombs in the area of the riverbank on the right-hand side east of Yixian Bridge. The reporter happened to be walking across the bridge and saw six Japanese aircraft flying towards him from the sky above Zijin Mountain. When passing Zhongshan Gate, they suddenly lowered altitude and indiscriminately dropped bombs. At the same time, two other Japanese aircraft dropped more than ten sulfur bombs, shaped like leather balls, from low altitude, like falling stars descending, reflecting blindingly in the sunlight. The bombs landed with several loud bangs. Immediately, several houses about thirty yards away in front caught fire. In an instant, several long motorboats were seen swaying down along with the incendiary bombs. Then, the sound of explosions and the sound of walls collapsing rang out together, like thunder in the ears. At the same time, tongues of fire and pillars of smoke shot into the sky. After a minute or two, the sound of women and children wailing and screaming came in waves. Seeing the Japanese aircraft flying away, the reporter proceeded to the fire scene to investigate. The impoverished areas between outside Zhongshan Gate and Xihua Gate Street were devastated. In the rising smoke and dust, a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old boy was blown in half at the waist, and a middle-aged poor woman resembling his mother was nearby, her clothes and hair scorched. Beside her was her beloved son, crying uncontrollably. A few steps away, an old woman in her fifties caught the eye, her left arm and right face blown away, blood gushing out, struggling and trembling on a pile of bricks. Beside her was a seven- or eight-year-old child, his body difficult to put back together, but already stunned to death. Further back, a man crawled out of a pile of bricks, already having lost his mind, still pointing blankly into the brick pile with his hand, as if saying that his flesh and blood relatives were still inside. All twenty-odd houses in the area, which were already very dilapidated, had been turned into ashes by this bombing. Because the fire was at its most intense, the fire brigade arrived and did not allow pedestrians to pass through. A wave of crying was clearer and more sorrowful than before. According to the reporter's investigations before and after, a total of fourteen poor people died and more than twenty were injured in the area today. More than fifty houses were burned down and collapsed. The flames were extinguished around 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The capital has been subjected to two air raids in the past two days. This morning, six Japanese aircraft appeared in the sky and dropped several light bombs on the civilian airfield and nearby Chinese houses. Several houses caught fire and were destroyed. There were probably other aircraft involved in this operation. Yesterday, Japanese aircraft also targeted the civilian airfield for their bombing. After the air raid siren sounded at 11:00 AM yesterday morning, six Japanese aircraft flew over the city and dropped five bombs in the airfield. The remaining bombs landed in nearby open areas, and one house was slightly damaged, but there were no deaths or injuries. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Lanzhou Subjected to Air Raid</h3>
<p>Fierce Air Battle Over Guangzhou Yesterday</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Naval Press Department of the General Headquarters announced the following at 2:00 PM on the 5th: On December 4th at 1:00 PM, Japanese naval air force aircraft attacked the airfield in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, destroying barracks and four large aircraft (equipped with four engines) and ten small aircraft, and damaging several small aircraft.

<h3>Stagnant Warfare in Central Shanxi</h3>
<p>Our Troops, Joint Guerilla Forces, and Volunteers on Pinghan, PingSui, Zhengtai and Tongpu Railways Hong Kong</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] After occupying Taiyuan, the Japanese army claimed that all of northern Shanxi had been occupied by them, but in reality, we still occupy a vast area in the border areas of Shanxi, Hebei, and Chahar, with a large number of guerilla forces and volunteers. This force can threaten the Japanese army's rear communication lines on the Pinghan, PingSui, Zhengtai and Tongpu Railways at any time. The Japanese have recently attempted to eliminate the border areas, and judging from their recent military actions, they are indeed gradually pushing forward. For example, Japanese troops from Datong, Zhangjiakou, Beiping, and Baoding have all transferred a portion of their forces, dividing them into attacks on Hunyuan, Yangquan, Yixian, Quyang Yunsou, and Pingshan counties, with approximately a thousand troops on each route. Japanese aircraft are also constantly reconnoitering and bombing. Hunyuan, Yangquan, and Yixian have fallen one after another, but our troops knew their plan early on and are determined not to give up this advantageous base. They have united with the guerilla forces and volunteers in each area, and cooperated with the local people, and are separately resisting. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>German Newspaper Discusses Sino-Japanese Strategy</h3>
<p>Frankfurt. Today's Frankfurter Zeitung commented on the Sino-Japanese conflict, stating that it has now reached a decisive moment. The counterattacks launched by the Chinese side from this day forward show that Chinese Army Commander-in-Chief General Chiang Kai-shek is a clever strategist. The arrival of Japanese reinforcements may lead to the capture of Nanjing, but this is not easy. The Japanese army must fight for every inch of land. This fact fully demonstrates that the Chinese army has not been disorganized. The newspaper also stated that the lack of adequate munitions for the Chinese army is a disadvantage, but in other aspects, China has a huge war industry, that is, China has unlimited hinterland, which is sufficient for long-term combat.

<h3>The Far East Situation is Serious, and the British Attitude is Increasingly Firm</h3>
<p>Firmly Resolved to Safeguard Interests; Seeking to Maintain Close Liaison with the United States; Washington Attaches Great Importance to German Mediation Efforts</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the Far East situation, news from London indicates that Britain's attitude towards Japan has become more resolute, and some even advocate that all relevant countries jointly express their views, so that Japan understands that the European and American countries' interests in the Far East will not be abandoned. US naval personnel were satisfied after hearing this, and these personnel had already advocated strong action since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese dispute, and even suggested implementing a blockade in the Pacific. Diplomatic personnel believe that the US public may not support the joint expression of views by relevant countries, for two reasons: (1) Although the newspapers in some eastern US states mostly advocate that the US should cooperate with other countries, the majority of people in the country still adhere to the policy of isolation; (2) Regarding the parade by Japanese troops in the Shanghai Public Concession yesterday and the Japanese troops' blocking the US military's defense zone after the outbreak of the incident, although the US newspapers all expressed dissatisfaction, Congressional members generally believe that judging from the US's interests in the Far East, it is not worth risking a conflict with Japan. In addition, US diplomatic personnel attach great importance to the talks between the German ambassadors to China and Japan and the responsible authorities of the respective countries, and the State Department believes that if Germany can achieve something after the failure of the mediation efforts by the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, the US will not object. In other words, as long as there is a possibility of resolving the dispute between China and Japan, the US does not want to intervene. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the victory parade held by Japanese troops in the Shanghai Public Concession on Friday, the British House of Commons will question Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden on Monday. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>[London] According to today's news, the foreign authorities in Shanghai had given well-intentioned advice to the Japanese side before the demonstration parade held by Japanese troops in the Shanghai Public Concession the day before yesterday, but the Japanese ignored it. After the explosion occurred, the Japanese army occupied the central area of Shanghai without authorization. It is said that the British authorities consider this serious incident to be the first since the outbreak of the Shanghai war. As a result of a long discussion between Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden, it was decided to draft a declaration stating Britain's determination to safeguard British interests in Shanghai and Hong Kong and submit it to the Cabinet next week for approval. The reason why the British authorities consider the Shanghai situation to be unprecedentedly serious is that they fear that after the Japanese have set a precedent, they will become reckless and create a serious situation. At the same time, Prime Minister Chamberlain believes that merely lodging a protest with Japan will definitely have no effect, so he decided to ask the Cabinet to decide on a policy so that when harassment incidents occur again, they can respond accordingly, so as not to be caught off guard. On the other hand, Britain is seeking to maintain close liaison with the United States. It is generally expected here that when the House of Commons convenes next Tuesday, the Labour Party and the Liberal Party will launch a fierce attack on the government's "continuous retreat" policy, as they all believe that the Japanese's current recklessness is caused by the British government's retreat policy.

<h3>England Endures and Maintains Self-Restraint Despite Damage to Prestige</h3>
<p>Victory Ultimately Obtainable in the Final Round, British Press Comments on Japanese Military Parade in Shanghai International Settlement</p>
<p>[London] The "Sunday Dispatch" today carried an editorial addressing the Japanese military's "victory" parade in the Shanghai International Settlement on Friday. It stated briefly, that the unfortunate incidents in Shanghai were prevented from escalating into major disturbances due to the strong restraint of British, American, and French forces. Only the wise understand "acting in a timely manner" and "knowing when to stop." It continued, "The British can wait calmly, knowing that Great Britain invariably achieves victory in the final round. This is a great lesson of history, for only this round can provide a true judgment." An editorial in the "Sunday Times" stated, "The purpose of the Japanese military's 'victory' parade was undoubtedly to strike a blow against the prestige of the Western powers associated with the International Settlement. Their focus was particularly on the underlying danger posed by the United States and Great Britain. It was only thanks to the skillful and swift handling of the International Settlement police that an outbreak was averted. No honest person would dare to say that we have suffered no loss for failing to uphold our prestige. It should be understood that if our actions were not constrained by the pressing domestic problems and dangers, our actions might have been different today. However, things have reached this point, and our past and present suggestions have been that our actions in the Far East will be consistent with those of the United States. We do not wish to exceed the limits of American policy. This measure may temporarily cause our prestige to suffer, as it did in this instance. However, this is the only way to adhere to prudence." The article concluded, "Japan's current behavior clearly stems from the command of the military. The reckless and destructive behavior of Japan's senior commanders, disregarding the emotions of other nations, has greatly disappointed the public." (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the Japanese military's victory parade through the Shanghai International Settlement, local newspapers continue to cover it prominently, though with few comments. The "New Era" reported, "The Shanghai incident proves that the League of Nations is sometimes weak and ineffective, making coordination among European nations essential. This coordination should include all European nations, even the Soviet Union should not be forgotten." The "Excelsior" stated, "The established rights of the major powers in China should be acknowledged and should not become a question under any circumstances. Moreover, these established rights are closely and inseparably linked to the noble and enduring interests of the white race." The "Morning Light" reported, "The failure of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Beijing has immediately heightened the arrogance of the Japanese militarists. Although the Japanese government has issued declarations to reassure the public, the future of the foreign concessions in Shanghai remains unsettling. France, with its concession in a major Far Eastern city and its proximity to China through its Vietnamese colony, should be vigilant regarding these Japanese actions." (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Government to Issue Declaration</h3>
<p>Clarifying Stance Towards China</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Since the progress of the war, the idea that the Japanese government should seize this opportunity to reiterate the Empire's firm stance to both domestic and foreign audiences has been gaining momentum within the government and related authorities. Preparations are underway. As various European and American countries seem to be waiting for an opportunity to mediate, Japan should now lay bare its resolute determination to deal with the current situation, reject all delusional schemes, and move towards achieving the intended war results and the ultimate goals of the incident.

<h3>Japan-Soviet Fisheries Negotiations Stalled</h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Issues Statement Urging Soviet Government to Reflect</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the conclusion of the revised Japan-Soviet fisheries treaty, the two countries had been engaged in discussions. The Foreign Ministry issued the following statement on the 4th, expressing hope for a sincere attitude from the Soviet side:</p>
<p>"Since this spring, the Japanese government has sought opportunities to urge the Soviet government to reflect on the final agreement reached last autumn and to promptly sign the new agreement, aiming to eliminate long-standing fishery disputes. The Soviet government has consistently stated that the negotiations on the fisheries treaty were influenced by the general Japan-Soviet relations and has shown no inclination to reopen discussions, leading to delays until now. As this year's fishing season has ended, operators must prepare for next year. On October 19, Ambassador Shigemitsu pointed out to the Soviet government that the completion of the revision negotiations since last year and the signing of the new agreement were treaty obligations. He also wrote to Deputy Chairman Butenko of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, attaching the requested new agreement and repeatedly urging its signing. Finally, on November 20, Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Stomonyakov told Ambassador Shigemitsu that the Soviet government was prepared to conclude a new fisheries agreement based on the treaty, but that it was difficult to confirm the agreement reached between the authorities of the two governments last year as is, and that they were currently gathering specific revision proposals. The attitude of the Soviet side was unexpected by the Imperial government. While provisionally awaiting the opponent's specific proposal, we urged them to submit it promptly, but they claimed they were not ready, delaying the presentation of specific opinions. The Soviet government's attitude is merely delaying the fishery negotiations and must be regarded as neglecting the treaty obligation to sign a new agreement. In this situation, the Imperial government has maintained a cooperative attitude, enduring and urging the signing of the new agreement. However, as the Soviet government continues to delay negotiations, Japan has repeatedly endured and urged the Soviet government to reflect. We are now strongly urging the signing of the new agreement and deeply hope that the Soviet government will understand the fair attitude of the Imperial government and, in view of the overall Japan-Soviet relations, promptly resolve the new fisheries agreement."

<h3>British Dockworkers Refuse to Load and Unload Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Similar Incident Occurs in New York; US Cotton Exports to Japan Decline Drastically</p>
<p>⊙ Southampton, England: The Chang Hing Company's ship "Lizzie Richmond" arrived here carrying Japanese goods, but the local dockworkers refused to unload them. Therefore, the ship plans to carry the Japanese goods back to Canada. It has been found that the dockworkers who refused to unload the Japanese goods are members of the British Transport and General Workers' Union. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>⊙ Southampton: British dockworkers show a strong tendency to refuse to unload Japanese goods. An incident that occurred here today proves this. When the steamer "Lizzie Richmond" arrived at the port, it carried 200 tons of Japanese goods, including cotton textiles and Christmas wrapping paper. The dockworkers had unloaded part of the goods, but upon discovering the origin of the goods, they held an emergency meeting and decided to return the goods to the ship. However, other Canadian goods on the ship were still unloaded. Therefore, when the ship left the port, the Japanese goods were still on board. At that time, the workers' meeting also decided to recommend that unions in all ports take similar action. (Kokumin, 4th)</p>

When the Prime Minister's train arrived at the Italian border, representatives of the Italian government greeted him, and Italian troops paid their respects. Italian and Yugoslav flags were displayed at each station the train passed through. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>⊙ Capital of Yugoslavia: Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović departed for Rome this afternoon. Officials commented on the Prime Minister's trip, saying that Yugoslavia has no intention of joining the Anti-Comintern Pact of Italy, Germany, and Japan. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano visited Yugoslavia in March of this year and signed a treaty of friendship with Yugoslav authorities. The Prime Minister's trip is a reciprocal visit, and discussions will be limited to commercial issues and the issue of the Yugoslav minority in the Istria region of Italy. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia is scheduled to arrive here this afternoon for a visit. Renowned journalist Gayda commented in the "Italian Daily," saying, "The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia is coming here to hold talks with Italian government officials, with the primary objective of the following three points: To protect the cultural order of Europe and jointly oppose disruptive forces; secondly, Italy and Yugoslavia should move closer to each other within the Central European and Balkan systems; thirdly, Italy and Yugoslavia should cooperate with each other politically, economically, and culturally." (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>⊙ Capital of Yugoslavia: Well-informed sources here believe that after the Yugoslav Prime Minister's visit to Rome and the French Foreign Minister's visit to Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Prime Minister will also visit Germany to reciprocate the visits of German General Göring and Foreign Minister Neurath to Yugoslavia. This trip is expected to take place around January next year. Political figures here believe that the Yugoslav Prime Minister's reciprocal visit to Berlin is a clear sign of the growing friendship between Yugoslavia and Germany. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<h3>Belgian King Suddenly Visits England Again</h3>
<p>[London] Belgian King Leopold III, accompanied by his mother, arrived here at 4:45 PM and will stay for several days at a villa in the countryside owned by the Duke of Portland. King Leopold only made a trip here in late November, and this sudden visit is receiving considerable attention. It is rumored that Germany has made demands regarding Belgian Congo in Africa, and the King's visit is related to this matter. However, some believe that regarding the issue of Belgian colonies, the King's attitude was very firm during his last visit and he stated that the transfer of sovereignty over Belgian Congo to Germany was unacceptable to the Belgian people. Therefore, there is no need to express this again. Political figures believe that the King's visit to England has no diplomatic significance and is actually related to the issue of remarriage. However, Belgian sources say that since the death of his late wife, the King has been deeply saddened and has no intention of remarrying. (Havas, 4th)</p>

<h3>US Implements Five-Year Plan to Strengthen Pacific Defenses</h3>
<p>Building Large Airfield in Hawaii; Garrison Forces Increased to 20,000</p>
<p>[Washington] The United States is currently constructing defensive works in the Hawaiian Islands to ensure that these islands in the Pacific Ocean are protected from any attack by sea, land, and air. The five-year plan proposed by naval and land army officials, requiring an expenditure of US$20 million, is currently underway. In addition, US$17 million has been allocated to build Hickman Airfield, which will be one of the largest airfields in the world upon completion. It was previously rumored that the United States would only build ordinary-scale defensive works in the Hawaiian Islands. However, according to recent news, the scale of the construction is surprisingly large. The garrison forces have been greatly increased, numbering nearly 20,000, and their headquarters are located on Oahu Island, where Honolulu, the capital of the Hawaiian Islands, is located. Army officials say that this plan began before the Sino-Japanese incident, and now that they see the turbulent situation in the Far East, they feel that it is all the more necessary to strengthen American Pacific defenses. Therefore, they congratulate themselves on having foresight. After the United States withdraws from the Philippine Islands in the future, Hawaii will become the main site of the Western defense line. It is expected that the Hawaiian defense works will include underground ammunition and fuel storage rooms, underground airfields, and so on. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Britain Undertakes Major Reorganization of Military Organizations</h3>
<p>Major Reshuffle of Army Officers; Air Force Council to be Reorganized Next</p>
<p>[London] Well-informed sources recently announced that after Secretary of War Hore-Belisha visited France in September of this year to observe the country's army maneuvers and study its army organization, he felt deeply that the British Army needed to be updated with reference to the French organization. Therefore, he recently made major changes to the army officers, assigning outstanding talents to important positions. He also plans to organize a semi-official organization in the near future, called the "Imperial National Defense Military Association," to assist the War Department and encourage citizens to enlist. This association will be chaired by former Governor-General of India, Lord Willingdon, and deputized by Lord Derby, a member of the Joint Select Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform. A national defense propaganda campaign will be launched throughout the country in January of next year. In addition, well-informed sources also said that when Hore-Belisha was in France, he informed French military authorities of his intention to modernize the British Army, saying that the cooperation efficiency of the British and French armies would be increased once something happened. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>[London] The 9th Battalion of the Manchester Regiment of the British Army recently held a medal presentation ceremony. Secretary of War Hore-Belisha delivered a speech on the spot, praising the three members of the Military Council, namely, General Deverell, Chief of the General Staff; Lieutenant General Knox, Adjutant-General to the Forces; and General Elles, Master-General of the Ordnance, for voluntarily offering to resign to make way for more capable individuals. He also said that during this reorganization of army officers, all generals with combat capabilities were not transferred to departments but were still ordered to command troops to maintain contact with the troops. However, when necessary, they should still participate in military administration. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>[London] The British government has recently undertaken a major reorganization of various military organizations. The Army Council has been reorganized, and the Air Force Council may also be reorganized. Some members of the British House of Commons have offered this suggestion to the Air Ministry. Labour MP Mr. Fletcher will raise the issue of Air Force reform in the House of Commons next Tuesday. Regarding this matter, the opposition party is dissatisfied with the government on two points: The production of British aviation materials has failed to accelerate and is inferior compared to Germany; Secondly, the air defense policy adopted by the British Air Defense Authority is based on the principle that the best way to protect civilians from sky attacks is to bomb enemy air force bases. This air defense policy, based on aggression rather than defense, has drawn fierce criticism. However, according to sources close to the aviation industry, the British Air Force Council has achieved quite a few successes. Since 1934, the number of aviation personnel in the British Air Force has increased from 32,000 to 70,000, the number of aircraft pilots has increased from 2,000 to 4,700, and the number of military aircraft squadrons has increased from 53 to 123. There are currently 1,550 front-line aircraft, and this will increase to 1,750 by March next year. If overseas aircraft squadrons are included, the number of front-line aircraft has reached over 2,000. In addition, there are reserve aircraft (civilian aircraft that can be converted into military aircraft), the number of which is impossible to estimate. In short, the number of aircraft that can be used in wartime will exceed the total number of front-line aircraft by about two to three times. If the government accepts the discussion of the Air Force issue in the House of Commons, the discussion will focus on the following two items: ㊀ Whether the speed of aircraft manufacturing is sufficient; ㊁ Whether the air defense measures are appropriate. From now until the House of Commons discusses the Air Force issue, the government may provide various information to the majority party members in the House of Commons to reassure them. However, the issue of reorganizing the Air Force Council will still be considered. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Friendly Atmosphere in Franco-Polish Diplomatic Talks</h3>
<p>Bilateral Ties Expected to Strengthen; Poland Reiterates Colonial Demands</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw—French Foreign Minister Delbos, on a tour of Central European countries, held a lengthy discussion with Polish Foreign Minister Beck yesterday. Official sources stated today that the atmosphere during the talks was very friendly. This meeting was described as a routine exchange between high-ranking officials of allied nations. It is expected that the Polish Foreign Minister will raise the issue of colonies in future discussions. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw—French Foreign Minister Delbos today held a two-hour discussion with Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Army Chief Inspector Smigly-Rydz. The discussions centered on Poland raising another arms loan from France. Subsequently, Delbos met with President Mościcki to discuss a proposal to relocate 120,000 Polish Jews to the French colony of Madagascar to alleviate Poland's population density and quell the anti-Semitic sentiments prevalent in Poland for the past two years. Wealthy Jewish individuals have pledged US$1.75 million to support the emigration. Recently, a Polish delegation returned from an inspection tour of Madagascar, and a draft agreement has been discussed with French authorities. Unofficial sources indicate that Delbos and Beck, after their discussions, have decided on the issue of German colonies. If a resolution is reached, any territory beyond Germany's pre-war holdings, should other nations' territories be involved, must be distributed among all nations jointly. Diplomatic circles here generally believe that Delbos's talks in Poland represent a significant step forward in restoring Franco-Polish relations, marking a shift from the situation when Germany and Poland signed a non-aggression pact. (National Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw—While various newspapers here have commented extensively on Poland's demand for colonies in recent days, and the semi-official "Iskra News Agency" has issued statements advocating for it, Foreign Minister Colonel Beck did not mention this matter during his talks with French Foreign Minister Delbos yesterday. Rumors that Poland intends to borrow from France have also been denied by relevant parties. Essentially, there are no outstanding issues between France and Poland, and their economic relations face no particular difficulties. Colonel Beck and Foreign Minister Delbos focused on promoting cultural relations between the two countries, including plans to widely disseminate each other's languages. They are currently negotiating a cultural agreement. Beyond this, Foreign Minister Delbos informed Colonel Beck about the content of the Anglo-French talks in London, as well as his meeting with German Foreign Minister Neurath at the Berlin train station, which Colonel Beck greatly valued. Colonel Beck also believed that Neurath's actions might be a prelude to Germany stabilizing the situation through practical means, which cannot be ruled out. Poland is deeply concerned about the Rhine region agreement and does not wish to be excluded from future discussions with relevant countries, a point Colonel Beck also raised. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the gradual easing of the European situation. Colonel Beck also explained Poland's foreign policy, stating that its practical approach involves anticipating potential disputes between Poland and its neighbors and deciding on resolution methods in advance to avoid temporary friction leading to issues of national dignity. The Polish government also believes that direct negotiations between countries are preferable. Differences of opinion with Czechoslovakia regarding the minority issue are not new and are unlikely to be resolved quickly. The Polish government has also decided not to participate in the anti-communist agreement established by Italy, Germany, and Japan. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw—Regarding the colonial issue, Polish Foreign Minister Beck stated in a speech to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee on January 29th of last year, "Once the issue of redistributing colonies is brought up for international discussion, Poland should enjoy the same benefits as other relevant countries." As the issue of Germany reclaiming its old colonies gains momentum, Polish political figures recall Colonel Beck's above-mentioned speech, thus re-raising the issue of Poland acquiring colonies. For Poland, the colonial issue is inextricably linked to the issues of relocating surplus population abroad and securing raw materials. Poland has a surplus population, increasing by an average of 400,000 people annually, projected to reach 42 million by 1950. Furthermore, Poland's economy is severely affected by Jewish competition domestically, making it necessary to seek development opportunities abroad, thus precluding the nation's identification as a "satisfied nation." All of these are reasons why Poland needs colonies. Currently, the "Marine Colonial Association" is responsible for promoting the colonial issue. When British Lord Privy Seal Halifax visited Germany, the Association issued a statement stating, "The Polish government representative has repeatedly stated internationally that the current state of colonial distribution is unfair. If our country wishes to stand firm in the world, it will inevitably need colonies." (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw—Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck hosted a banquet for the French Foreign Minister last night, during which he delivered a welcoming speech, stating, "Foreign Minister Delbos's visit has significant political meaning. The cooperative relationship between France and Poland is exceptionally strong, and this is an important factor in the post-war international political revival. The amity between the two countries is not of recent origin, and you can be deeply confident in this. The people of our country unanimously welcome your visit, as evidenced by the commentaries in various newspapers." Delbos replied, stating that the Franco-Polish alliance treaty remains strong and satisfactory. This treaty was created because the needs of both sides were aligned, and their ideals were in harmony. However, the joint and consistent relationship between the two sides is not intended to exclude other countries. On the contrary, both sides are willing to actively cooperate within the League of Nations framework to stabilize the general situation. In essence, the policies pursued by our two governments are based on complete mutual understanding and shared ideals, and I am very pleased to have the opportunity to reaffirm this during this visit." (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw—A report that French Foreign Minister Delbos's visit aimed to mediate between Poland and Czechoslovakia in order to resolve their differences has been denied by the "Ati News Agency," which is close to the Polish Foreign Ministry. It stated, "Poland believes that if this were true, it should be initiated by Czechoslovakia. Moreover, Poland's foreign policy is based on the principle of conducting bilateral talks and would not involve a third country." Regarding German Foreign Minister Neurath personally welcoming Foreign Minister Delbos at the train station during his transit through Berlin, this is clear evidence of a relaxation in Franco-German relations, which is very gratifying.

<h3>New York Political Commentator Assesses Results of Anglo-French Talks</h3>
<p>[New York]—Prominent political commentator Lippmann recently published an article in the "New York Herald Tribune" commenting on the recent Anglo-French talks. He stated that Britain and France have grown closer as a result. British Prime Minister Chamberlain did not demand the abandonment of France's friends and allies in Central and Eastern Europe, nor did he demand a reduction in France's status as a first-rate power in Europe, so that Britain would not incur Germany's resentment because of its pro-French stance. In short, Britain will not disregard affairs on the European continent for the sake of the security of the British Empire. "The overall resolution of European problems cannot be sought through fascist countries, as totalitarian regimes cannot survive without creating enemies abroad. Once a peaceful situation is stabilized, there is no reason for the controlled economies of Italy and Germany to exist, and the same is true in Soviet Russia. German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini are both well aware that once the European problem is resolved, the foundation of their power will be completely destroyed. Britain and France are also aware of this, and their continued talk of an overall resolution is nothing more than a way to delay and avoid war." (Havas, 4th)</p>

<h3>Truth of Sky Murder Case Revealed</h3>
<p>Caused by Jealousy; Court Has Decided</p>
<p>Versailles—On December 20th last year, a bizarre "sky murder" occurred in France, shocking the nation. An aviator named Lallemand was found with a bullet wound to his neck, wandering in the fields outside Paris. According to him, he was flying his plane in the skies above Versailles at an altitude of 2,000 feet when a female passenger suddenly shot him in the back. He was not seriously injured and was able to land the plane. However, the female passenger threatened him with a pistol, jumped into the pilot's seat, and took off alone. After receiving this report, the police investigated at various airfields but could not find the plane. The next morning, news came from England that a plane piloted by a young, beautiful French woman had crashed in a fishing village in Sussex last night, destroying the plane, but the woman was unharmed. Her name was Schmidt. The woman was subsequently extradited to France, and the contents of the incident became clear after a court trial. Lallemand was originally Schmidt's lover, but he later fell in love with someone else. Schmidt was extremely angry and committed the "sky murder." However, Lallemand now has a family and did not hold Schmidt too accountable, so his lawyer spoke on Schmidt's behalf in court. When the verdict was announced today, no fewer than ten thousand people inside and outside the courtroom were listening for news. The jurors considered the case an ordinary assault and ordered Schmidt to pay court costs, exempting her from further prosecution. The crowd cheered upon hearing this news. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

In addition, according to the New York Times, the Haitian people are deeply dissatisfied with their president, Vincent, accusing him of occupying a position without performing his duties, and even accusing him of colluding with Dominican President Trujillo. Demonstrations have been held nationwide, and strikes have been encouraged to express opposition. The Haitian Congress is therefore holding frequent meetings in the hope of pacifying the people.

<h3>Measures for Foreign Ships to Transfer in Lower Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Jointly Formulated by Military, Finance, and Transportation Ministries for Implementation; Tiensheng Port's Market Multiplies in Prosperity</p>
<p>Nantung Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war and the blockade of the Yangtze River below Kiangyin Fortress, only foreign merchant ships have been sailing between Shanghai, Nantung, and Tiensheng Port. Small river boats are used for transshipment between Tiensheng Port and Taitsing Port, facilitating intermodal transport between ports and ships to various cities upstream. The National Government has now announced five measures jointly formulated by the Ministries of Military Administration, Finance, and Transportation to temporarily allow foreign ships to load and unload passengers and goods and import and export goods at port areas, and to implement transshipment between Tiensheng Port and port areas. ㊀ Foreign ships are allowed to load and unload passengers and goods at port areas until the end of the Yangtze River blockade. These ships are also allowed to transship export and import goods between port areas and Tiensheng Port to facilitate wartime trade. ㊁ The road or waterway transportation between port areas and Tiensheng Port should be handled by the original domestic transportation agencies entrusted by foreign merchants, and no other vehicles or ships may be rented without reason. The original transportation agencies should try to increase transportation tools as much as possible to facilitate transshipment. ㊂ Regarding customs inspection procedures, goods transferred and exported through port areas should be declared to the customs at the port of origin for inspection and collection of export duties, and the customs should send copies of the relevant customs declarations to the Chinkiang Customs and Kianghai Customs for verification, so that the goods can be transshipped at the port areas under the jurisdiction of Chinkiang Customs and verified and released for export in Shanghai. Goods imported from Shanghai and transported to Tiensheng Port for transshipment should be verified and taxed by Kianghai Customs, and a copy of the customs declaration should be sent to Chinkiang Customs and the customs at the designated final destination for verification and release. ㊃ Regarding inspection procedures along the way, those who use vehicles or ships to transship import and export goods between port areas and Tiensheng Port through inland or inland rivers should apply to the customs officers stationed at the port area or Tiensheng Port for a transshipment certificate, stating the name of the declarant, the type and quantity of goods, the source, etc., and hand it over to the declarant for safekeeping for inspection by military and political authorities along the way. ㊄ Foreign shipping companies should give the same convenience to Chinese ships transporting goods from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which need to be transferred to foreign ships at Tiensheng Port for export, and to goods imported from Shanghai, which need to go to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River via Tiensheng Port and are willing to be reloaded onto Chinese ships for transport, as they give to foreign merchants.</p>
<p>Nantung Imposes Curfew Early</p>
<p>The number of Japanese warships on the Kiangyin River off Nantung's Langshan has recently increased to more than 40. Since the morning of November 29th, they have repeatedly bombarded the Liuhaisha area. Kiangyin also has booming cannons, but Tongshuh is as peaceful as usual. The Nantung Garrison Headquarters has imposed a curfew starting at 8 p.m. every night, with no travel allowed after 10 p.m. without a special pass, due to the increasing number of refugees from the Kiangnan and Chekiang war zones coming to Nantung, which is causing rumors to flourish. This is in order to carefully maintain public order.</p>
<h3>Local Goods Transported to Shanghai in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Currently, Nantung is the only route for traffic between Shanghai and various ports along the Yangtze River, as well as the southern section of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway and the Shanghai-Nanking Railway. Traffic between Nantung and Chinkiang has not been disrupted. However, due to the large number of refugees, vehicles and ships are being requisitioned for transportation, and the schedules of small motorboats and ships are irregular. Mail delivery between Shanghai and Nantung is also smooth, with nearly a thousand bags of mail transported daily from various ports to Nantung for transfer to Shanghai. Mail between Nantung and Yangchow is delivered by postal vehicles. Local goods from north of the Yangtze River have been transported in large quantities along the Yenshui Canal to Tiensheng Port for loading onto British and Italian ships bound for Shanghai. Fresh pork is inconvenient to transport in Shanghai, so it is slaughtered at Tiensheng Port, gutted and cleaned, and loaded whole onto ships. Butchers at the port are very busy, slaughtering up to 500 pigs per day. In addition, the west wharf of Tiensheng Port has been opened as a berthing place for foreign merchant ships. Due to the increase in passengers and the busy transport of goods, the market at Tiensheng Port is extremely prosperous, more than twice as usual. Direct telegraph lines between Shanghai and Nantung are disrupted, so telegrams are routed through Chinkiang, but they are also currently unavailable. Telegraphs to various places south of the Yangtze River are currently suspended, and undelivered telegrams are mailed to Chinkiang for forwarding. Various routes north of the Yangtze River are also overwhelmed due to busy relaying. (1st)</p>
<h3>Regulations for Grain Merchants on Rice Distribution and Retail</h3>
<p>French Concession rice stores to distribute 8,000 bags. Public Concession rice stores reopened yesterday.</p>
<p>Hoarders have had their rice sales rights revoked.</p>
<p>The French Concession authorities have always maintained a meticulous and strict attitude regarding the distribution and sale of rice within the concession. All residents are aware of this. However, since the implementation of the rice distribution system, a small number of residents and rice merchants have violated the regulations. Therefore, a solemn announcement is made again to ensure that everyone fully understands the situation and avoids repeating mistakes. Currently, each rice store in the French Concession is allocated 40 bags of rice each time, with a limit of a maximum purchase of 10 catties per person. After the rice is retailed completely, the price is limited to 8 and a half cents per liter. The amount of rice reserved by each rice store for its employees is also limited to a maximum of 10 catties per person. During rice distribution and sales, the police department sends patrol officers to the scene to provide care and protection. Violations of regulations will result in suspension of business. After the allocated 40 bags of rice are sold out, the French police department will investigate the remaining rice. If the amount of rice exceeds the amount required for the rice store employees' consumption and there is hoarding behavior, the police department will permanently revoke the rice sales rights. On the 4th of this month, the following four stores lost their rights to sell rice from the Public Works Department: De Feng Rice Store at 93 Avenue Villemer, Zhi He Rice Store at 103 Route du Père Hilaire, Gong Da Rice Store at 132 Rue de Canton, and Gong Da Third Branch at 633 Route Béthune. De Feng Rice Store had falsely reported having no rice, but it was found to have 30 bags, totaling 2,740 kilograms. Zhi He, Gong Da, and Gong Da Third Branch each had 980 kilograms, 1,165 kilograms, and 1,960 kilograms, respectively, remaining after the 40 bags of rice were sold. The following is a record of the distribution of rice to miscellaneous grain merchants in the French Concession and the reopening of rice stores in the Public Concession yesterday.</p>
<p>French Concession to Distribute Rice Again</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association allocated 20,100 bags of Annam rice arriving in Shanghai. The distribution method stipulated that 8,000 bags would be distributed to 200 rice stores, including Wan Chang and Yong Da, in the French Concession for retail. The French Municipal Council has agreed with the Rice Store Industry Association that each rice store within the 200-store quota in the French Concession will receive this shipment of foreign rice for another round of distribution. The association has issued an urgent notice that all rice stores in the French Concession must prepare payment and bring miscellaneous transportation fees of 10 yuan to the association to fill out the rice purchase application form from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM on the 5th. The deadline will be strictly enforced. Therefore, those who went to pay and apply were quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Public Concession Rice Stores Reopen</p>
<p>After the fourth batch of 30,000 bags of foreign rice purchased by William Viëtor &amp; Co. on behalf of the South China Rice Industry Association arrived in Shanghai, the Rice Store Industry Association sent personnel on the 4th to unload the goods. The first shipment was sent to 200 rice stores in the French Concession and was completely delivered that night. Yesterday morning, they continued to transport the rice to 300 rice stores in the Public Concession. Therefore, the protection of the wharf and the escort of the vehicles have been taken over by a platoon of British soldiers sent by the British garrison. After the rice stores received the shipment of foreign rice, they successively opened for business to retail the rice. There were many ordinary people buying rice, and the entrances of the rice stores were extremely crowded. The police department dispatched one Chinese and one Western patrol officer to maintain order in front of each store.</p>
<p>Closed Restaurants Gradually Reopening</p>
<p>Some restaurants and meal providers in the Public Concession and the French Concession had to temporarily close because the three batches of foreign rice had been sold out, and the fourth batch was delayed en route, making it impossible to purchase rice. Now that the fourth batch of foreign rice has arrived and is being distributed to various stores for sale, and the Annam rice purchased by the Miscellaneous Grain Industry has also arrived, they are all finding ways to purchase rice. Restaurants and meal providers that have been closed for many days have gradually resumed business.</p>
<p>Shipment of Domestic Food Still Pending</p>
<p>Members of the Miscellaneous Grain, Bean and Rice, and Rice Store Associations, such as Wan Yu, Yu, Ren Da, and Da Cheng, purchased a large amount of food from various provinces in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various associations issued certificates to prove that the purchased food was for regulating the food supply of Shanghai citizens. Various rice stores have sent personnel to purchase the food. Because this year's domestic rice and wheat have had bumper harvests, it is quite easy to purchase enough. However, the county governments require requesting instructions from the provincial government for approval before shipping grain out of the province because it concerns the transportation of grain out of the area.</p>
<p>Rice in Nanshi Cannot Be Shipped Out</p>
<p>When our troops had not withdrawn, the total amount of domestic rice shipped to Nanshi was about 20,000 piculs. Due to the limited time, all of it was stored on ships and could not be unloaded. Since the various rice industry groups requested the French authorities to negotiate for release, the French authorities have negotiated with the Japanese side several times without success. In fact, there is probably no hope of release. The losses of the various cargo owners are estimated to be more than 250,000 national currency. However, the cargo owners are still making final efforts.</p>
<p>Approximate Amount of Rice Needed for Consumption in This City</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was learned from the grain industry that the amount of rice needed in Shanghai in the past was about 12,000 piculs per day. After the war, due to the decrease in population, it has been reduced to about 7,000 piculs. Since domestic rice cannot be transported to Shanghai due to traffic obstruction, the food supply for Shanghai citizens relies entirely on foreign rice. Although the South China Rice Industry Company and various food groups have ordered foreign rice from abroad to regulate the supply in Shanghai, those who retail and purchase rice from various rice stores are still crowded. Therefore, efforts are being made to continue ordering to maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens.</p>
<p>Flour Prices Remain Relatively Stable</p>
<p>The stock of wheat in Shanghai is very sufficient. It is being rushed to be produced by flour mills such as Fu Xin and Fu Feng. Currently, the wholesale price of No. 2 flour is 4.45 national currency per bag, and the wholesale price of No. 4 flour is 3.70 national currency per bag. There is no stock of No. 1 flour and No. 3 flour on the market. The total stock of No. 2 and No. 4 flour is about 200,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Retail Quantity of Rice Stores</h3>
<p>The Association Issues a Warning Before Investigation by the Police</p>
<p>At 12:30 PM yesterday, Yang Pei-zhi, a resident of 3 Rong Sheng Lane, Annakin Road, near the iron gate of Nanyang Bridge, Rue Paul Beau, French Concession, went to the rice store to buy one yuan worth of rice. At that time, he discovered that the amount of rice was short, so he reported it to the patrol officer on duty in front of the store and asked him to take the store's people to the police station. However, the patrol officer believed that there was no shortage. Yang immediately placed the rice he had bought at the police booth and went to the Rue Lafayette police station in charge. After the Western police officer verified it, he realized that the weight of the rice sold by the rice store was not accurate. Therefore, the translator gave him three copper coins as compensation for the insufficient amount of rice sold by the rice store. Finally, Yang took the rice he had purchased to the Rice Store Industry Association upstairs at 52 Rue Amiral Courbet, Public Concession. After the person in charge weighed the rice, it was confirmed that there was indeed a shortage. However, since the police officer on duty at the time did not take the store manager or clerk to the police station, it was decided to give the rice store a warning first. It was also stated that in the future, if any member rice store shortchanges customers, the store's people can be taken, along with the purchased rice, to the association, and the registered rice store card will be immediately revoked, and the distribution of rice will be stopped. According to regulations, one yuan can buy 11 catties and 12 taels of rice with an accurate city scale. Citizens are also urged to report any fraudulent activities in order to eliminate corruption.</p>
<h3>Special District Rickshaw Industry Suffers Losses of Approximately 50,000 Yuan Due to the War</h3>
<p>The deadline for license application this month is tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Special District Office of the Rickshaw Industry Association of this city has set the deadline for members to donate and apply for licenses this month as tomorrow. According to the person in charge of the association, the number of rickshaw licenses in the First Special District is still set at 9,500. However, affected by the war, more than 500 vehicles were damaged in the area north of the Suzhou Creek, and more than 600 vehicles in the Nanshi area were not able to be pulled out. Based on the cost of 80 yuan per vehicle, the industry's losses have reached 50,000 yuan. Currently, various operators are planning to rebuild the damaged or lost vehicles. As for business, due to the depressed market and the scarcity of passengers and goods, it is quite difficult to maintain.</p>

<h3>Former President of Hangzhou's Zhijiang University Proposes a Safe Zone in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Using the New Market area as the zone. He came to Shanghai from Hangzhou specifically for negotiations.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that when the Japanese authorities met with news reporters yesterday (the 4th), Mr. Fei Shu, the honorary retired president of Zhijiang University in Hangzhou, happened to arrive from Kangzhou. He suggested that the former Qixiaying (i.e., the area along the lake at the New Market) in Hangzhou be designated as a safe zone for civilians to live in, as the area is outside the lines of attack and retreating troops. When he asked the Japanese authorities about their attitude toward this proposal, a spokesman for the Japanese embassy said that the proposal was currently under study and asked Mr. Fei whether he knew what the Chinese authorities' attitude was toward it. Mr. Fei replied that he did not know, but he believed that they would definitely approve it. Mr. Fei later told the reporters present that he had lived in Shanghai for 30 years and knew many Chinese citizens and officials. He came to Shanghai from Hang specifically for this purpose. He said that his proposal had been endorsed by the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss. A foreign reporter then asked the Japanese spokesman to note that he had reliable information that the Chinese authorities were very much in favor of this plan. The Japanese spokesman then asked Mr. Fei to postpone conducting this matter non-publicly with the Japanese authorities.</p>
<h3>Brief News from Beijing and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Stamp plates still stored in banks. The Tianjin Customs has a peculiar status.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News dispatch from Beijing on November 2nd stated that the Japanese are currently actively consolidating their power to control North China. The Tianjin and Beijing postal administrations are now entirely managed by the Japanese, with only nominal relations with the Nanjing government. The Russian postal official, Mr. Dumaf, was detained for a long time because the Japanese demanded the stamp plates but did not succeed. He has now been released. The Central Government had ordered these plates to be stored in a certain foreign bank, and the Japanese were unable to retrieve them. It is said that a new version will be printed in Japan to create new stamps. The status of the Tianjin Chinese Customs is quite peculiar and very secretive. According to reliable sources who know the details, the Tianjin Customs authorities and the Japanese authorities have agreed that future tax revenues will be remitted to Nanjing only for the amount necessary to pay the principal and interest on foreign debts, with the remainder stored in a certain bank for future overall resolution. Apart from controlling tax revenues, the Japanese authorities have not yet interfered in the administration of the Customs. However, commerce in Tianjin remains unusually sluggish. Customs revenues are unlikely to have a large surplus. Moreover, according to various sources, Japanese goods imported into Tianjin are now exempt from any duties. As a result, Customs revenues have further decreased. Japanese newspapers are recently full of grand plans for the economic development of North China, and claim that many companies are being organized with huge amounts of capital. However, such extravagant talk is already familiar, and at least the Party has heard it from time to time in the past two years, but it is only empty talk and has not been realized in practice. If this is due to a lack of necessary capital, it seems unlikely that any major development will be realized according to the plan in the near future.</p>
<h3>Quarantine Launches Also Detained</h3>
<p>Portuguese launch not yet returned. Difficult to resume river lines in the short term.</p>
<p>The five launches of the Portuguese merchant Dege Chinai Navigation Company at 612 Suzhou Road have not yet been returned. Several quarantine launches of the Port Quarantine Office have also been detained. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Quarantine Launches Also Detained</p>
<p>In addition to the Customs patrol ships and the dredgers and survey ships of the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, etc., the quarantine launches of the Port Quarantine Office, such as the Mulan and Cai E, have also been detained and have not been released. As for the Jianghai Customs transport ships Liuxing and Haiguang, after being released, they are currently loading grain, fresh water, and oil to be transported to various lighthouses and light buoys at sea to maintain the safety of navigation.</p>
<p>Detained Launches Not Released</p>
<p>Since the five launches of the Portuguese merchant Dege Company were detained by the Japanese, the head of the company, Gao De (a Portuguese), filed a complaint with the Portuguese consulate. After the consulate requested the Japanese to release the launches, reporters learned from the company yesterday morning that there has been no result. As a result, the company's plan to resume various inland river lines is unlikely to be realized in the short term. As for the launch Xinyongan, which sank under the Shanxi Road Bridge on the Suzhou Creek, the hull is sinking further and has not been removed.</p>
<h3>Charity Groups Provide Relief to Refugees</h3>
<p>Christmas Relief for Children Movement</p>
<p>The International Relief Committee is launching an expanded children's relief movement in honor of Christmas on the 25th of this month. The committee sent letters to various food companies, such as Tai Kang and Fen Sheng Garden, and major companies such as Sincere, Wing On, New World, and The Sun, as well as the Kang Yuan Canning Factory, requesting items such as candy and toys, and hoping that all sectors of society will voluntarily donate to distribute to the disaster-stricken children in various shelters on that day for consolation. Families are also welcome to bring candy or old toys to donate to the committee or nearby shelters.</p>
<p>Urgently Needed Items to Shelter from the Wind and Cold</p>
<p>Many of the shelters set up by the International Relief Committee are temporary worker-built structures. At this time of severe cold, the cold wind is invading, which is enough to affect the health of the refugees. The committee urgently needs all sectors of society to donate old newspapers or advertising paper for pasting to shelter from the wind and cold, or burlap sacks, etc., to make curtains or temporarily replace bedding to protect against the cold.</p>
<p>Refugees Remaining in Shanghai Continue to Be Sent Back</p>
<p>Charitable organizations in this city are taking in refugees on the one hand and continuing to send them back to their hometowns within the possible scope on the other, in order to ensure sustainability. At the same time, many of those who are temporarily staying with relatives and friends are also voluntarily returning to their hometowns. Therefore, the number of passengers leaving Shanghai on the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Tongzhou lines has been quite large in recent days. The Joint Relief Association of Charitable Organizations yesterday continued to send more than 120 refugees from Ningbo and Shaoxing and more than 230 refugees from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Shanxi to Tongzhou by boat to return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>The First Special District Federation Begins to Take In Refugees</p>
<p>The Relief Committee of the First Special District Citizens' Federation has been actively preparing since resolving to take in homeless refugees along the streets. However, it is quite difficult to find spacious empty houses for the time being. It is now learned that the committee has first taken in 200 people at 6 Dagu Lane, Tiantong Road, and is planning to expand relief efforts.</p>
<h3>Qiu Xin Factory Has Resumed Work</h3>
<p>The Qiu Xin Factory in Nanshi is a shipbuilding factory funded by French merchants. It was originally protected by French soldiers. Now the factory has resumed work, but all the craftsmen are picked up by car from Nanyang Bridge every morning and sent to the factory. However, to avoid danger, they are not allowed to go out after arriving at the factory.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Expresses Cooperation with the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Acknowledging that the Nanjing Road incident has ended. The nationality of the grenade thrower has not yet been identified.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the Japanese spokesman declared yesterday that after the Japanese military authorities exchanged views with the Municipal Council, the Municipal Council has taken the necessary steps within its power to prevent a recurrence of the bomb case on Nanjing Road on Friday. Someone asked, "Is the Japanese authority willing to cooperate with the Police Department to prevent a recurrence of such cases? In the future, if the Japanese army has any movements in the concession, would it be willing to take the safest route and the most convenient time according to the advice of the Municipal Council Police Department?" The spokesman replied, "It is currently difficult to answer such questions." He was then asked, "Do you think this is an important question?" The spokesman replied, "It goes without saying that the Japanese authority will cooperate with the Municipal Council. However, we cannot specifically explain or answer the questions raised here. We also believe that with this cooperation, such cases will not recur." Someone in the audience then asked whether the four demands made by the Japanese authority to the Municipal Council Police Department, as reported in the Japanese newspapers yesterday morning, were true. The spokesman said that this was probably a memorandum from the Japanese authority to the Police Department requesting that necessary steps be taken to prevent a recurrence of such cases. He knew nothing about the news reported in the Japanese newspapers because he did not have this newspaper.</p>
<p>The Japanese military spokesman, when meeting with news reporters yesterday (the 4th), spoke on behalf of the Japanese senior commander and expressed his gratitude for the precautions taken by the authorities of the French Concession and the Public Concession on various roads through which the Japanese army passed when traveling from Jessfield Park to Hongkou on Friday. He also said, "As you all know, an unfortunate incident occurred during the Japanese army's march. However, the Japanese authority now considers this case to be over. After representatives of the Japanese army and the Municipal Council Police Department exchanged views, the Police Department has agreed to do its best to prevent a recurrence of such cases."</p>
<p>The remains of the person who threw a grenade at the marching Japanese army on Nanjing Road on Friday, who was hit by four bullets and died on the side of the road, were still on display at the Public Mortuary yesterday, and it has not yet been determined who he is. The person looks like an Oriental and is about 30 years old. However, his nationality cannot be determined. He was wearing a dark green Zhongshan suit, blue serge pants, a gray coat, a gray felt hat, and yellow canvas shoes. The autopsy is scheduled for Monday.</p>
<h3>Great Way Municipal Government Discovered in Pudong</h3>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reported that the Japanese army has appointed Su Shuxiao as the mayor of Shanghai and Zhu Yuling from Taizhou as the chief of the Public Security Bureau. They took office at 10:00 AM yesterday inside the police station in front of the Chunshen Wharf in Pudong.</p>
<p>Another report stated that since the westward movement of the war, two or three scattered small organizations have been discovered in the four suburbs of Shanghai, but they can only control extremely small areas. Currently, the situation in various places, such as Nanshi, which has been a scorched earth after two weeks of fire, and Zhabei, where there have been three months of fighting, has very few intact houses. Residents in the north and south are scattered, and the scene is desolate. Pudong, on the other hand, has not been as severely damaged as Nanshi and Zhabei. Most of the houses are still intact. Last month, Su Xiweng went to the area to prepare to organize the "Great Way Municipal Government of Shanghai." Su Xiweng is a native of Fujian who studied in Japan from a young age and speaks Japanese. When he first arrived, the first step was to recruit more than 500 police officers. He established the "Military Commander's Pacification Class Police Officer Training Institute" with 360 officers, divided into three teams of 120 people each, led by a team leader, all under direct control. The remaining 100 officers first formed the Pudong Police Branch in order to stand guard. In recent days, the two police forces have been implementing training on the Qingnian Hui training ground in Pudong, which has been very busy. On the other hand, preparations for the "Municipal Government" are being made rapidly in order to gradually advance the force towards Nanshi, Zhabei, and western Shanghai. The government was established in the Laiyi Ferry Police Branch yesterday (the 5th) by improvising. A large number of flags had been made in advance, with a yellow background and a circular red and green Taijitu in the center. Yesterday morning, they were displayed in front of empty houses on various streets and along the Huangpu River. In addition, a dozen motorboats were dispatched to fly flags and parade back and forth in Pudong. At 12:00 noon, a banquet with 50 tables was held in the Pudong Branch. Dozens of Japanese military officers and advisors were among the guests. The inauguration was announced, and several speeches were given alternately with the Japanese side. Because the meanings were not clear, there was a translator. It did not disperse until about 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Refugee Areas Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Merchants Registering Enthusiastically. No Worry of Beverage Shortage</p>
<p>The Nanshi refugee area is now gradually becoming more stable. Many shops have already opened for business. The relief society believes that public stoves are essential for residents, so they have specially opened a large-scale refugee area public stove in front of the Small World to meet the public's needs for beverages. In addition, because it is feared that children among the refugees will miss out on their education, they are now planning a refugee area school in the group houses in Yu Garden. Burials for the dead are handled by the Pushan Villa and Tongren Fuyuan Hall. Medical treatment for refugees is handled by two doctors in the Yimiao and the Red Cross Hospital of the Lingxue Society on Minguo Road. Drug stores such as Yishengtang have also opened. The only difficulty is that all food needs must be transported in from outside, which inevitably makes prices even higher than in the concessions. As for pawnshops, they have all moved to the concessions, making it very inconvenient for residents who want to redeem their pawned items.</p>
<p>Since the Nanshi Refugee Area Chamber of Commerce was established at the request of merchants who had been displaced and unemployed for a long time, it has organized a goods adjustment committee. The Guanshengyuan Food Company is voluntarily providing transportation vehicles. The chamber of commerce, seeing the enthusiasm for registration in recent days, has appointed store representatives as order monitors in the area. In order to prevent petty theft at night, the International Relief Committee has imposed a curfew from 7:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning. Anyone walking on the road will be detained on the spot. Lang Boro, the director of the area police station, also hopes that law-abiding merchants will not go out at night. If there are still people lingering on the road during curfew hours, the police officers will take emergency measures to protect the security of the merchants in the refugee area, and there is a fear of shootings. Please be aware of people impersonating meter readers or census takers who are mixing in during the day. Also, please do not tease or talk with the troops outside the refugee area to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Ends and Cancels Various Lease Contracts</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau in this city has recently been closed. All lease contracts signed by the bureau with various industries before August 13 have been temporarily terminated due to the extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<h3>Machine Association Dinner Colleagues Stop Eating to Donate</h3>
<p>And propose raising a public accumulation fund</p>
<p>The colleagues of the Machine Association Double Tenth Festival Dinner have donated all of their savings from stopping the dinner due to national crisis, totaling 4,574 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen in national currency, to the International Relief Committee for the needs of refugee relief. It is also suggested that since the westward movement of the Shanghai war, the disaster area has become wider, and refugees from all over have gathered in Shanghai, suffering from hunger and cold, which is unbearable to say. Fortunately, your association has come forward to provide relief, providing clothing, food, housing, and medical care to the best of your ability. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have been able to survive and gradually recover. The kindness and compassion are admirable. The colleagues of our association have donated all their savings from stopping the dinner due to national crisis to your association's One-Corner Movement for the Sixth Shelter, doing our best to express our sympathy. I think that there are many organizations of dinners at sea, as well as other public and private groups, some of which must have public accumulation funds. If your association can plan and do its best to publicly solicit these savings to increase the relief power, I think that the city is not short of public-minded and righteous groups, and benevolent gentlemen, who will definitely generously donate money to help in times of emergency, and jointly support the righteous cause. This will allow all refugees to avoid starving to death and have clothing and food, which is a win-win situation and will greatly benefit them. I have provided my humble opinions for your reference. Please consider and implement them, and I hope to hear back from you.</p>
<h3>Xinshi is Peaceful</h3>
<p>According to Mrs. Gao Xiang, who came to Shanghai from Xinshi Town, Deqing County, she hired a boat from Xinshi to Donghuang with her children on the 20th of last month, and transferred from Donghuang to Ningbo on the 2nd of this month to take the Deping wheel to Shanghai. When she left Xinshi, the place was still peaceful. Only troops occasionally passed through. All stores were operating as usual. There were many people who had taken refuge in Xinshi from nearby, but rumors occurred from time to time.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Establish a Women's University</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's University, initiated by educators and celebrities at home and abroad, such as Liu Tingfang, Sun Guiding, Liu Wendao, Zhang Yaoxiang, and Wu Zhiqian, has been actively preparing since the organization's preparatory committee was formed and Zhao Yiwei was appointed as the preparatory director. It is about to be completed. The founding declaration has already been issued, and its main points are two: First, it will create a new culture and innovate society from the foundation. Second, it will mold new women and revive the nation from the roots. It is heard that the school board is currently being hired, the school board is being organized, and a request is being submitted to the Ministry of Education for registration.</p>
<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Informs Banks to Suppress the Practice of Drawing Bills at a Discount</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Bank, Money Shop, and Money Exchange Associations, stating that speculators in this city have been exchanging legal tender by drawing bills, with a discount of about 20 yuan per 1,000 yuan. The Ministry of Finance has verified and approved the supplementary measures proposed by the Shanghai Silver Money Industry Association and other associations. Circulating bills for drawing is originally for the convenience of receipts and disbursements and turnover among Shanghai Silver Money Industry colleagues in order to stabilize the market. If there is a practice of drawing bills at a discount, it should be immediately suppressed in order to value finance.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Severe Cold: Ice Seen in Ditches</h3>
<p>The weather in this port had turned mild a few days ago, but yesterday it suddenly turned severely cold again. Ice accumulated in the ditches, and the sharp north wind was like a knife, causing the refugees wandering the streets to be unable to withstand the cold and shrink back in fear. There were even more deaths from freezing than usual. Therefore, concerned people should make proper plans for the hundreds of thousands of refugees to survive the severe winter.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Volunteer Corps Bids Farewell to Graham</h3>
<p>Colonel Graham, Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, has served for four years since taking office, and his planning and achievements have been remarkable. As his term has expired and he is about to return to England, all officers of the regiment held a farewell parade in the drill hall yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. First, Xu Tongyu, the squadron leader and major of the regiment, gave a speech and presented a souvenir. Then, the commander thanked them. After the ceremony, the commander hosted a banquet in the hall for the officers of each team and their families. The commander's duties will be officially taken over by Tu Xiaoxiang, who has already arrived in Shanghai, on the 9th of this month.</p>
<h3>Third Shareholders' Meeting of Taikang Bank</h3>
<p>After Taikang Bank temporarily suspended operations, two extraordinary shareholders' meetings were convened, but due to the current situation, a quorum was not reached, and formal meetings could not be held. In the second discussion meeting, a tentative resolution was passed to resume business. However, as this matter is of great importance and concerns the rights and interests of all shareholders, it is hereby decided to convene the third extraordinary shareholders' meeting at 2:00 PM on the 18th of this month, still at the bank's location at No. 112 Ningbo Road. All shareholders have been notified to attend on time and jointly discuss the way forward.</p>
<h3>Huang's Garden Reduced to Ashes</h3>
<p>Ruined walls and broken bricks fill the eye with sorrow; rare and exotic flowers all gone with the wind.</p>
<p>Huang's Garden, located in Xilao Cemetery in Caohejing Town, west of Shanghai, is the property of Mr. Huang Jinrong, a philanthropist in Shanghai. The location is suitable for both transportation and scenery. Later, the owner exhausted his efforts to plan and manage it, making it a scenic spot for suburban recreation in Shanghai. Every spring and summer, ladies flock there like clouds. The garden has many precious flowers and trees, and a zoo is enclosed, housing various exotic birds and animals for people to watch. The interior architecture is magnificent and elegant, costing a great deal. However, Mr. Huang is over seventy years old and has long retired from the garden, cultivating his mind and character. In recent years, apart from participating in local public welfare and various charitable activities, nothing more has been heard of him. When the August 13th Shanghai War broke out, he devoted himself to rescuing refugees. As the war situation changed and the city fell, the family members in the garden all fled, resulting in a severance of contact and unresolved worries. Now, after entrusting people through the intercession of Mr. Huang's Chinese and foreign friends, they were dispatched yesterday to conduct an on-site inspection. According to the reply, the entire garden was burned down. Apart from the ruined walls and broken bricks and one or two pavilions inside and outside the garden, there is nothing left. After learning this, Mr. Huang deeply felt the loss of the crystallization of his life's energy and was deeply saddened, especially for the rare flowers, exotic trees, various rare animals, and rare books and classics in the garden. Because the above-mentioned items are difficult to collect and cannot be purchased with money, the loss is difficult to estimate. Everyone who hears about it cannot help but sigh with regret.</p>

<h3>Continued Detailed Report on the Destruction of Buildings in Nanshi</h3>
<p>Many Buildings from Ximen to Dananmen Destroyed; The Fire Line on Zhaojia Road Reaches Two or Three Miles</p>
<p>The great fire in Nanshi, leaving behind a scorched earth, has been reported in previous issues. Here is a continued report on the destruction in other areas:</p>

The area around the Lao Dafang tea shop and Danfenglou restaurant inside Ximen, leading to the Guandi Temple and Daquanfu restaurant, and Wengjia Lane and Jinjiafang were burned, with over a hundred houses destroyed.

To the east, from the Sanpailou Hongqiao intersection, past the Fuxingyuan restaurant, the building opposite the pharmacy guild, a one-story teahouse, burned all the way past Xianji Bridge to Jinyu pawnshop. To the west, on both sides of Sanpailou Hongqiao, such as the Diyi Lou teahouse and Yonghexing cloth shop, all the way to the Xue Nong bottom entrance of Dengyun Bridge, the fire line in the Zhaojia Road area can reach two or three miles, crossing five or six roads.</p>
<p>Sipailou (Four Arches): Starting from Quchawan, north to near the refugee area, and turning east into a Dong Street running between Da and Xiao Dongmen, and turning west into Xueyuan Road, reaching Guangqi Road. To the east, the Caiyi Street, Dafugui restaurant, Futai clothing store, and Manli Bridge fish market area can also connect to Dong Street. The former site of the old Municipal Public Security Bureau, Xundao Street, entering Daufang from Zhonghua Road, invading near the Shuixian Temple, is also half scorched earth. Sixty percent of the houses from Dong Tangjia Lane to Qiaojiabang Yongxing Bridge have also been destroyed. Along Dong Zhonghua Road, starting from the entrance of Xundao Street, scattered and reaching the Xiaonanmen area, only a few sections remain intact. The Qiaojiabang entrance of the Bao'an Tuan headquarters was also destroyed, and nearby deaf and mute schools were partially damaged.</p>
<p>Xiaonanmen (Small South Gate): The area inside the city gate has not been affected, but on the opposite street, starting from Jiahelong rice shop, the houses on both sides, passing through Yuetangfang Lane and Fogejie Street, all the way through the Majia Ting Nanfang Book Market, Madeji dowry shop, Chaoyanglou, Yan Rongji dowry shop, Yu Changshun dowry shop, Shen Nanchang dowry shop, Wang Yuanxing dowry shop, and Huang Yuanlong dowry shop, burned quite a bit until Jiang Yanze pharmacy.</p>

<p>North of Xiangua Street (Salted Melon Street): From Dongmen Road, through Tie Mao Lane and Sanguantang Lane, reaching the inner and outer Xiangua Street of the Quanzhang Huiguan, the pharmacy and ginseng shop areas on both sides of the two roads, burned all the way past Taiping Lane, east from the Bund Taiping Lane and Dongcheng Lane, west to Zhonghua Road, and south to Dama Tou Street, leaving no clean ground. Over a thousand houses were destroyed. Even if there were steel and concrete buildings, the exterior was still good, but only the outer shell remained, and the inside had become scorched earth.</p>
<p>Laobaidu (Old Ferry) Area: The houses in the area of Langjia Bridge Dam and the surrounding area still exist. What was destroyed was nothing more than the areas along the river, etc. The bombed areas are still habitable. After crossing Laobaidu Street, few houses are complete. Furthermore, Wangjia Pier, Wanyu Pier, Wanyu Street, and the Dongjiadu area are in the most terrible condition. All the houses have collapsed. If one were to walk there, it would be difficult to discern the names of the roads and the east and west directions. Broken walls and rubble are like</p>
<p>wild mounds. The inner roads of Wangjia Pier and Zhuhang Pier, and the Chaoli Huayi Street, Xin Street, Wangjia Pier Street, Wanyu Street, Daji Lane, Yongzhen Lane, Xianghe Lane, and Xiaopi Lane, the two sides of Wanyu Sauce Garden (Wanyu Sauce Garden was not destroyed) up to Dongjiadu Catholic Church (the church was not destroyed, but the Catholic Church Fire Brigade was half bombed). Outwardly, the inner and outer Bund streets of Zhuhang Pier, Wangjia Pier, and Dongjiadu were all destroyed. Yizhichun Tea House at Dongjiadu was also destroyed, and a stone counter of a Nanhuo shop was burned to ashes. After crossing Dongjiadu Street, the inner side was not destroyed, and the outer side was half destroyed by fire and half by bombing, up to the rice mills and rice warehouses at the Rice Wharf. There were three to four thousand houses. Several lumber yards in the middle were also burned, and the wharves and warehouses along the Huangpu River, such as Taiping Wharf, were not intact.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Coastal Areas South of the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Tinglin Town Completely Destroyed; Order Gradually Restored in Nanqiao</p>
<p>The southern bank of the Huangpu River, located on the coast, was the first to bear the brunt of the Japanese landing. News is scarce. For the past month, when Pudong was passable, most of the refugees detoured through Zhangang, Dujia Hang, Chenjia Hang, Tianfu Nunnery, Shenjia Hang, Sanlin Tang, Hejia Hang, Beicai, Yangjing, and other places to cross the Huangpu River and escape to Shanghai. Yesterday (the 2nd), several people passed through Donggou at 2:00 PM. Transportation had been cut off, but fortunately, they were rescued by a small Texaco steamboat and were able to retreat into the concession. It is said that 80-90% of the houses in Zhangyan City, Jinshan County, have been destroyed. There are more than two hundred Japanese troops stationed there. Robberies occur frequently in the countryside, and there are reports of daily deaths and injuries. When the Japanese troops landed in Jinshanwei and Jinshanzui, it was learned that we had built defensive works along the coast to protect the embankments, which the Japanese bombarded with artillery. Many of the villages outside the embankments have been destroyed. Since the 4th of last month, large units of Japanese troops have been landing and advancing. Songyin suffered relatively little damage. The market in Ganlüxiang has recovered early. In the Zhujing area, due to the rapid outbreak of the incident, less than a hundred people escaped, and even the agencies did not have time to evacuate, resulting in chaos and heavy losses. When the Japanese troops occupied Tinglin Town in Songjiang County, the southeast streets had already been burned down. In recent days, all the houses in the town have been reduced to ashes, leaving only the residence of Zhou Zhanqi, where the Japanese headquarters is located, the county-run elementary school used as barracks, and the three locations of the Jesus Church. After the 25th, fires broke out in villages large and small near the town, and the flames spread to a radius of six miles. Even the homes of Tang Diba, etc., in the towns of Yanduntou Town Henan, which borders Songjiang and Fengxian, have been affected. There have been tragic deaths of men and women, such as the Zhang Jianshi family of eight, who died in the artillery fire, Mr. Dai, who suffered eight knife wounds, and Mr. Cai and Mr. Gong, whose corpses turned to ashes. Farmers such as Zhu Heshang were shot dead at the Long Bridge. Such cases are too numerous to list. There was fierce fighting at the Xiaozhoujia Cemetery, and the scars are especially numerous. Yexie suffered less damage, but at Qianbu Jing, which is five or six miles from the town and borders Songjiang and Fengxian, on the 9th of last month, when one of our brigades retreated to Songjiang, it encountered Japanese troops in the middle, resulting in hand-to-hand combat for two hours. Finally, the isolated army was trapped and valiantly sacrificed, leaving corpses strewn across the field, many of which were not buried. About 30% of Caojing was destroyed by artillery fire. Japanese troops were stationed there a few days ago, but have recently withdrawn. Chongque and Shanyang and other places have recently become gathering places for salt smugglers, and the market is gradually recovering. In Nanqiao Town, Fengxian County, the streets and houses are as before. Although the area was once disturbed, fortunately, merchants such as Dongya, Dingfeng, and Yishengzhen have made efforts to suppress the unrest and raise funds to recruit men to defend and protect the area. The county government, police station, and other agencies had already burned down before the evacuation on the 7th of last month. Later, dozens of unscrupulous people took advantage of the chaotic order and set fire to public places and the small radio station of the Agricultural Improvement Center. The public places were built with donations from Shen Menglian, the former chief of the water police, and others, as a place for local organizations in the county to work. Now, it has suffered this calamity, and the losses are immeasurable, especially the Education Bureau, the County Party Headquarters, and the library, which have suffered the most damage. The market in Zhuanghang Town is busier than before, due to the relocation of people from Tinglin and other places. Qingcun Port is still commercially prosperous, but the area is complex and difficult to deal with. The markets in the four townships, such as Qianjia Bridge, Jinhui Bridge, and Qixian Bridge, are as usual. The Daoyuan was completely looted on the 3rd. Fengcheng was the most destroyed by artillery fire, and the scenic spots have become relics of the past. The towns in Nanhui, such as Xinchang, Zhoupu, and Datuan, are relatively far from the war zone and have suffered very little damage, and local order is well maintained. The liveliness is especially pronounced in places such as Zhaojialou. At the same time, according to an official who escaped from the trail, the security teams and bureau chiefs and police chiefs of Songjiang, Fengxian, Jinshan, Qingpu, and Nanchuan counties were ordered to retreat to Beiqiao on the 9th of last month. There were encounters at the Huqiao on the Songhui Road and at the foot of Dong Sheshan, resulting in many sacrifices. Wang Gongyu, the Songjiang Special Commissioner, has been transferred to the Jiangning District Special Commissioner, and Yu Xilai, the Fengxian County Magistrate, has been appointed as the secretary of that district.</p>
<h3>British-American Tobacco Factory in Pudong to Resume Operations on the 7th</h3>
<p>The British-owned Yizhong Tobacco Company (i.e., British-American Tobacco Factory) in Pudong, originally scheduled to resume operations on December 6, has now been rescheduled to officially resume operations on the 7th. All workers who have been working in the factory in recent weeks, such as those in the Chinese packaging, copper, and printing departments, will still gather at the New Customs Wharf on the 6th as before, and go to work in Pudong.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the British-owned Yizhong Tobacco Factory (i.e., British-American Tobacco Factory) in Lujiazui, Pudong, which was originally scheduled to officially resume operations today (the 6th), with male and female workers taking tugboats and iron barges from the temporary pontoon bridge built in the Bund Fenyuan directly to the factory's wharf to enter the factory, has been postponed by one day to tomorrow (the 7th) because the pontoon bridge could not be completed in time. All factory workers with copper badges and photos can enter and exit the Bund Park in the morning and evening.</p>
<h3>Talking About Ningbo Residents Relocating</h3>
<p>Houses in the Countryside are Even More Expensive Than in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to people from Ningbo, the current situation there is very peaceful. However, since the north bank of the city was bombed on the 12th of last month, residents were shocked by the tragic state of the bombed corpses, so the hearts of the people are quite uneasy, and they have moved to the countryside. Therefore, the city's population has decreased by sixty to seventy percent. These people are mostly those who have just returned to Ningbo from Shanghai, so they mostly still rent houses in Shanghai. After arriving in Ningbo, they have to rent houses again. Now they are escaping from the city to the countryside, so they have to rent houses again to shelter themselves. Therefore, on average, each family has to bear the burden of housing rent. The so-called "cunning rabbit has three burrows," and people are now imitating it. Moreover, houses in the countryside are even more expensive than in Shanghai. For example, the rent for a small attic room is often more than ten yuan. Therefore, most people in the countryside rent out their houses, while they build their own thatched huts, so the profit is tenfold, better than working hard in the fields all year round.</p>
<h3>Seeking News from Hometowns</h3>
<p>Taicang: If there are fellow villagers from Taicang and Shuangfeng Town who have taken refuge in Shanghai, please provide information to Mr. Yang Yuming at No. 309 Hankou Road, or call 93248. Your news will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Songjiang: Hu Shouheng, a member of the Education Committee of the Songjiang County Education Bureau, Zhu Wen, the head of the First District, Bao Yongren, the principal of Yangjiaqiao Elementary School, and others have been out of contact since the fall of Songjiang. If anyone knows their whereabouts, please write to Hu Shouzhong at No. 270 Chongqing Road, Xinhuan Vocational School (telephone 36181). Your help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<h3>Yitaixing and Others Purchase Huge Amount of Hongji Coal</h3>
<p>Shipped to Shanghai in Batches on Taikoo Steamships</p>
<p>Yitaixing Coal Company and the French-owned Dewey Foreign Firm, in order to regulate the fuel supply in Shanghai, have ordered a huge amount of Hongji white coal from Annam, which is being shipped to Shanghai in batches on steamships of the British-owned Taikoo Company. After the 3,000 tons brought by the Niuzhuang steamer were unloaded a few days ago, the market price soared because the weather was getting colder and stoves were in urgent need of coal. Demand exceeded supply, and the stock was quickly exhausted. The wholesale price was 48 yuan per ton in national currency, and the retail price was about 52 yuan per ton in national currency. Another 3,000 tons under Yitaixing's name will be shipped to Shanghai on Taikoo steamships the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Gold Jewelry of an Old Woman Robbed</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 10:00 AM, an elderly local woman, Ms. Huang, was taking a car to visit relatives in the French Concession. However, while passing through the intersection of Route Tenant de Tour and Avenue Orléans, she was suddenly accosted by a rogue, who snatched the gold circle she was wearing. The woman shouted for help, and the thief fled into Dingxiang Lane nearby and disappeared without a trace. The woman was unable to track him down, and only sighed in frustration before getting back in the car and leaving without reporting the incident to the police.</p>
<h3>Amateur Dance Party Opens</h3>
<p>The Amateur Dance Research Association at No. 7 Junle Village, Rue D'Édouard VII and Rue de Tsintao, was founded by Xu Guodong, Xu Weiru, and Chen Xiang. The venue is spacious, the floor is smooth, the setting is beautiful, and the music is elegant. All members are ladies of high society, which is very different from the current popular dance schools. The association officially opened yesterday, welcoming visitors from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Change in Flag Hanging at Autumn Horse Racing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Race Club's spring and autumn horse races are highly valued by foreigners. During the horse racing season, the club usually hangs three flags: one is the British national flag, one is our national flag, both hanging on the roof of the west end of the grandstand, and the other is the horse racing flag, hanging on the top of the big clock. However, the recent autumn horse racing has changed the usual practice and only the British national flag and the horse racing flag were hung.</p>
<h3>Sacrifice of Chinese and Western Supplements</h3>
<p>Jiuxing Vitamin Malt Extract Cod Liver Oil, Jiuxing Vitamin Milky White Cod Liver Oil, Jiuxing Egg Yolk Malt Extract Cod Liver Oil, Vitamin Chicken Juice, and Vitamin Beef Juice, distributed by Sima Road's Zhongxi Pharmacy, are now being offered with a buy-two-get-one-free promotion to benefit customers.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>We have read in the news column of your newspaper on the 5th of this month about an accident at Aihua Pharmaceutical Factory this morning, which is clearly a misunderstanding. No. 132 Shandong Road was sublet by our company to Nan City Yu Feng medicinal material firm two months ago. Therefore, it was not our company that was involved in the accident this morning. Please correct the information.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Aihua Pharmaceutical Factory</p>
