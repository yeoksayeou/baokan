<h3>我軍按照預定計劃自動撤至第一道防綫</h3>
<p>目的在脫離敵艦砲火威脅　該綫新陣地已有嚴密佈置　敵一度進犯劉行被我擊退</p>
<p>中央社云、我軍發言人談、滬戰開始以後、我方在虹口楊樹浦等處積極採取攻勢、敵軍陣地日形侷促、我方早已預料敵增援後、必將襲一二八故技、在長江口沿岸利用海軍之優越炮火、掩闢登陸、我軍對沿江作戰計劃、早經决定、在其登陸之時、奮勇攻擊、予以重大損失、並延長其時間、在其登陸之後、使其各個不能互相聯絡、現此項計劃已按步實現、敵軍所遭受之損失、為空前所未有、現目的既達、自前日起已照預定計劃自動撤至第一道防綫、其目的在逐漸脫離敵艦砲火之威脅、而引入於陸軍陣地戰、現我軍新陣地已於昨晚佈置就緒、此後戰事當有重大之發展云、</p>
<p>茲招得可靠方面消息自楊行月浦形勢吃緊以後、我軍卽固守新陣地、搆築鞏固之防禦工程、以避免敵方兵艦力量、而以陸地戰爭誓必殲滅敵軍實力、現我軍自閘北之靑雲路八字橋、以迄江灣·廟行·至楊行西面二里處之某地、以迄羅店、新陣地業已佈置完竣、嚴陣以待、誓予敵軍以重創、以削弱其陸戰實力、</p>
<h3>市中心區我軍移北站江灣聖一帶</h3>
<p>敵軍如再進犯必予痛擊　羅店殘敵仍予嚴阻前進</p>
<p>中央社云、楊行之役、我忠勇將士以血肉之軀、與敵軍砲火相拼、血戰兩晝夜、陣綫屢進屢退、我軍雖有壯烈犧牲、但敵軍因採取攻勢、遭我痛擊、創傷尤為戶重、估計暱軍死傷至少莊三千人以上、我軍自將月浦楊行一綫後撤後、已在瞿家浜一帶據工事堅面之新陣地堅守、同時敵軍因傷亡慘重亟待整理亦未敢再進、故該處戰事昨日轉趨沉寂、惟因楊行陣綫之變化、我市中心區引翔鄉及陽樹浦一帶陣地、遂成突出之形勢、易被敵軍包圍、在軍事上為極不利之形藝、我軍為避免無謂犧牲計、於昨日上午以整齊之陣容、自動移至北站至江灣一帶之第一道防綫、改取守勢、該綫陣地、早已築成堅固之工事、敵如進犯、必能憑險予以嚴重之打擊、至羅店方面之殘敵、仍被我大軍嚴阻、决難前進云、</p>
<h3>軍事要員之觀察</h3>
<p>求爭取最後勝利為目的　尺寸士地進退不足重視</p>
<p>據某不事要錢向記者談、渠對滬戰之觀察云、滬戰爆發至昨日為號三十二日、我軍抱定長期抗戰、爭取最後勝利之决心、抵抗敵軍侵略、血戰逾月、精神之壯烈、戰績之宏偉、已寒敵膽而震驚全球、當戰事爆發之初、我軍以英勇之姿態、向敵迎頭猛攻、虹口楊樹浦一帶敵軍重要陣地、迭被我軍攻克、摧枯拉朽、勢如破竹、我軍前鋒並曾一度進遠匯山碼頭、切斷敵軍聯絡、滿擬一鼓而下、直搗敵營、無如敵軍源源增援、進擾沿江濱海各地、牽制我軍進攻、以致功虧一簣、當上月二十三日敵增援部隊在羅店蘊藻浜張華浜等地登陸時、先以敵艦大砲向我陸地轟炸、藉阻我軍進入砲火綫內、故我軍欲根本阻遏敵軍登陸、實為一不可能之事、惟我軍氣吞山河、銳不可當、每乘敵軍登陸立足未穩之際、卽疾進痛擊、予以重創、是以虹口、楊樹浦區、吳淞區、及羅店區之敵軍、始終朱能銜接會合、而羅店區殘敵被我包圍、尤為狼狽不堪、三週以來、各路劇戰、敵軍死傷數逾二萬、創傷之慘重、遠在我軍之上、惟敵軍在滬作戰者、計有陸軍六師團、海軍陸戰隊約一萬人、軍艦百三十餘艘、飛機三百架、騎兵千餘名、並附機械化部隊、共中尤以敵艦所附大小口徑之大砲共七百門之多、火力最為雄厚、自寶山被敵艦砲火攻破、我姚子香營全部壯烈犧牲後、月浦興楊行一綫、我軍陣地已夫屏障、然我軍猶能與敵血戰兩晝夜、予以重傷後、始行後撤、精神之壯烈與作戰之勇猛、遠非敵軍所可比擬、至於市中心區引翔鄉一帶陣地之後、全因避免被敵包圍、此乃戰略上必採之步驟、不足為奇、試觀連日我軍在軍工路一帶殲敵經過、即可知如我軍全綫進展時、該區地帶極易收復、現我軍全綫所守之第一這防綫、工事早經築就、陣地異常堅固、且離江邊較遠、敵艦七百餘門大砲火力、完全失却效用、於我極為有利、敵軍如再進犯、當可知我忠勇將士實力之不可厚侮、總之、我軍抱定長期抗戰之决心、以求爭取最後勝利為目的、勝固不驕、敗亦不餒、目前尺寸土地之進退得失、在整個戰局進行中、實不足重視云、</p>
<h3>楊行敵軍進犯劉行</h3>
<p>我軍嚴守原有陣綫　敵已退回楊行西郊</p>
<p>昨日敵傾全力由楊行向西推進、企圖進窺劉行、我軍在東陸附近一帶新陣地構築防禦工事、嚴拒敵軍來犯、淸晨槍砲之聲、由疏漸密、前綫發生接觸、十時後停息、聞敵軍進犯朱逞、已退回楊行西郊、我軍嚴守原有陣綫、待機進攻、張華浜方面、昨有敵軍二千、進襲泗塘河、經我守軍抵禦、未幾兩軍逼近、勢將短兵相接、我軍突出陣綫、以大刀手溜彈迎擊、殺敵頗多、敵受挫潰退，我軍未予追擊、進駐南泗塘河、</p>
<h3>月浦我軍待機反攻</h3>
<p>中央社云、吳淞方面之敵、十日起藉強烈之砲火、向我楊行綫進犯、楊行鎭在密集砲火下、已成一片焦士、我數度反攻後、安然移至新陣綫、敵軍以傷亡慘重、亦在整理𥙷充中、由未敢進據、故前夜（十二日）該綫戰事沉寂、已飛調生力軍準備反攻、至月浦方面、因受楊行局部環境關系、亦放棄原有陣綫、據守新陣地、待機反攻、以與楊行正面相策應云、</p>
<h3>羅店瀏河戰事沉寂</h3>
<p>中央社云、羅店方面之敵、前日（十二日午後以小組游擊隊、分路向我進攻、我軍奮勇迎擊、敵小l隊長井三、當塲擊斃身上搜獲日記一冊、藉悉羅店方面之敵、係巍留米第十二師團、前晚羅店瀏河之綫、較為沉寂云、</p>
<h3>大批敵軍昨日登陸</h3>
<p>中央社云、昨晨黎明前、有敵商輪改造之運輸艦兩艘、駛入浦內、一名鳥取丸、停靠大阪碼頭、有敵軍約千名左右登陸、一名衣笠丸停靠招商局中棧、起卸軍火、直至昨日下午六時、尚未完竣、下午一時後、又續有敵運輸艦天洋丸、大陸丸及東泰丸等三艘相繼駛入、分別停靠招商局北棧碼頭、大阪碼頭及黃浦碼頭、除又有敵革約二千左右登陸外、並續運來大批重軍械、如坦克車、裝甲汽車、重砲、及其他軍需品等、敵軍之源源增援虹口及楊樹浦預料日內該處將有劇烈反攻也、</p>
<h3>敵機又往北新涇炸沉難民船三艘</h3>
<p>虞姬墩河面幾為屍身壅塞　死傷人數又在三百人以上</p>
<p>（本報特訊）昨日下午四時許、敵機數架又飛往非武裝區域之北新經肆行轟炸、當時見有滿載難民之民船六艘、正駛經北新涇西首約七八里、虞姬墩之蘇州河面、敵機遂投下重量炸彈四枚、致有三艘被擊沉沒、當時無辜難民慘遭滅頂及炸斃之屍身、該段河道、幾為壅塞、為數又在數百人以上、慘酷情形、見者酸鼻、該管水巡分隊、立即派警趕往照料、該處因地處鄉僻、交通頗感不便、加之敵機投彈後、仍久留不去、更頻頻低飛用機槍掃射、至本市各慈善團體之救護車輛、無法前往施救、直至昨晚九時許、始有卡車二輛、前往載來一部份受傷難民四十餘名、送至仁濟醫院救冶、</p>
<p>又據某救護團體報告、昨日下午國際收容所及蘇州同鄉會、雇有公信小輪、拖帶民船儿雙、運送難民赴嘉興、另有恊茂輪、拖帶十二雙、運送難民赴蘇州、至四時半、行至距離我新涇西約八里許某地時、突有敵機兩架、低飛偵察、盤繞數匝、即投重量炸彈兩枚、於是公信恊茂兩輪所拖之船、分別解纜、敵機又投兩彈、當時、共沉民船三隻、死傷計三百餘人、由救護隊趕往救護、將傷者分別送至仁濟等各院急救、情形極為悽慘、</p>
<p>又據中央社消息、敵機昨在北新涇炸沉難民船三艘、並毀六艘、係駛往嘉興之小輪所拖帶、另一艘駛住蘇州之小，則啟行較遲、幸未罹難、</p>
<h3>昨日敵艦移泊情況</h3>
<p>吳淞口一帶約四十艘　石洞瀏河亦約四十艘</p>

<h3>敵機昨日肆暴一斑</h3>
<p>專事破壞商民房屋　焚燒無關戰鬥財產</p>
<p>敵機數十架、昨竟日在閘北·南市·浦東·南翔各處恣意轟炸、為狀極慘、茲分紀如下</p>
<p>浦東</p>
<p>昨日午後一詩四十分許、敵機二小隊六架、又飛往浦東白蓮涇一帶投彈十餘枚、旋至三時許又有敵機五架再度飛往、投彈三十餘枚、二度共投約有五十枚之多、該處大來公司棧房對過中國酒精廠著彈有二十餘枚、廠遭炸燬、（按該廠週圍約有三四里、開設僅三年）附近鄉間中彈十八枚、炸燬民房三四十幢、義泰與煤棧南棧亦落彈七八枚、浦東南碼頭亦投彈二枚、炸燬平房十數幢、大來棧房雖幸未遭投彈、但其牆垣已遭彈片炸損、彈痕斑斑、工人平民受傷有三十餘人之多、當場被炸斃命者亦有十數人、受傷者由該處浦東紅十字會派員前往救護醫治、</p>
<p>浦東陸家嘴附近一帶、於昨日下午四時許、復遭敵機二架投擲燒夷彈多枚、該處民房當即着火、一時延燒甚烈、浪烟繚繞沖天、距至四時半許、又有敵機二架、飛往投彈二枚、至五時半許、火勢稍煞、嗣即熄滅、</p>
<p>南市</p>
<p>昨下午一時半、敵轟炸機飛出、計七架、內四架飛赴浦東南黃浦白蓮涇一帶、另有三架、在南市薛家浜米碼頭及大碼頭一帶、投擲炸彈凡十餘枚之多、惟爆炸者甚少、敵機於南市沿浦碼頭轟炸後、復在近城一帶大東門、小南門外投擲炸彈、亘兩小時之久、至下午四時許、敵轟炸機三架、又出現於環城上空、又在東半城外邊近碼頭方面投彈七八枚、而十六䋠東門路一帶、亦被擲兩彈、南車站南華商電車公司及國貨路新普育堂各被投兩彈、但死傷尚少、</p>
<p>閘北</p>
<p>昨晨七時許、敵機五架飛往閘北共和新路一帶、投擲燒夷彈十數枚、該處鎭安里即首當其衝、立卽着火、一時火勢大熾、霎時蔓延、致不可收拾、雖經閘北一·二·三·四段各區救火會驅車馳往灌救、奈因該處河水告乏、灌救不易、旋至十一時許、金陵路大統路等處均發生火警、其勢益猛、滬南區西北二區、及董家渡二區等救火會開警、亦均相率驅車馳往、奮勇恊助施救、嗣該處火塲、達有四處之多、自東大統路起、至西金陵路麥根路車站棧房止、火災區域、延燒數里之廣、直至下午五時許、火勢始告稍殺、</p>
<p>南翔</p>
<p>南翔鎭連日被敵機屢往轟炸、精華本已化為焦士、乃前日上午敵機七架、復往該鎭素以羊肉及小饅頭市集之香花橋及南街一帶轟炸一小時之久、該鎮最繁盛之南街香花橋、已全成焦士、死傷民衆不少、</p>
<h3>虹口楊樹浦昨大火</h3>
<p>昨日上午楊樹浦引翔鄉一帶房屋、擊中砲彈、燃燒甚烈、火勢復向閃延、至午稍殺、至午後三時許、虹口吳淞路北四川路、老靶子路、外虹橋、東熙華德路一帶民房、突然着彈起火、一時烟冲霄漢、火星四濺、其狀備極猛烈、直至晚六時許仍未熄滅、</p>
<h3>救護工作緊急亟需官民合作</h3>
<p>傷兵醫療器械缺乏　國人應速慷慨解囊</p>
<p>字林報云、戰地訪員鐵爾特曼氏、以生動之筆、紀中國傷兵困苦情形、字林報前亦嘗評論此事、得鐵氏之證明、乃益顯明矣、此為上海中國市民急迫應盡之責任、而義不容辭者也、紅十字會工作者之勞績、已受鐵氏熱烈之讚仰、惟目下顯需巨款、置購待遇傷兵所必要而極缺乏之物品、諒彼尊重其國家·令譽之華人、對於此舉、必能表示同情、慷慨解囊、曩者他國亦覺傷兵所需醫藥上之安慰品等物、專賴官方來源、實嫌不足、尚須仰給於官方之外、紅十字會實際乃在感覺官方力量有限之時、而告成立、上海今雖遭遇兵燹、然資財尚富、希望熱心有力華人、速起輔助目前使傷兵關注之中國各團體、俾得減除缺憾、鐵氏描寫中國戰士忠勇之言論、會由各獨立方面予以徵實、日者某君曾至傷兵醫院、聞一肺部受傷之華兵問其長官、何時始可歸家、待向詰詢、則彼之所謂“家”者、即前綫之戰壕是也、噫、具此忠勇精神者、於受傷後、而因設備簡陋、致不能獲得醫藥救治的基本方法、此將為束手旁觀之華人同胞一種罪惡矣、</p>
<h3>我前方兵士守衛雄姿</h3>

<p>字林報云、前駐北平英大使署參贊、現駐華英代辦賀民、十二日晨十時三十分、訪駐華日天使川越於滬邸、密談一小時之久、所談之問題、未經宣露、賀氏已定十四日、偕英大使署武官彿萊塞、乘汽車入京、按賀氏於一九三四年加入英使署、當賈德幹爵士交卸返國、許閣森爵士未履新之際、賀氏會攝理使署職務、賀氏於𢿛洲大戰中服役英陸軍、一九一九年、供職外交部、近因許閣森爵士受傷、趕至滬埠、以便代爵土處理外交事務、到滬後、卽漏夜檢閱一切外交檔案、俾得大局之綫索、</p>

<p>［日內瓦］各國代表團今日皆已抵此、以便參加國聯大會第十八屆會議之開幕禮、西班牙國民軍亦派非正式代表團來此、承認問題因以發生、但此代表團將在複選西班牙政府為行政院理事等問題上、竭力運動表同情於國民軍之友邦、為其打倒政府之聲援耳、印度代表阿迦汗將被舉為大會主席、惟西班牙伐倫西亞政府總理奈格林以代理主席之資格致開會詞、但僅泛論國際事件、而未提及西班牙內戰此後大會將秘密投票、以决定西班牙爲行政院常任理事之資格問題、屆時能否獲得三分之二之必要多數、現尚屬疑問、大會今日議程雖全屬儀式、然遠東問題定將為主耍論題之一、（中央社十三日路透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>歐洲的戰雲</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>在全面抗戰局勢開展以後。大家的注意力都集中於戰事形勢的推移。而對於遠東以外的國際政局則多不加注意。這本是自然的現象無足爲怪不過現代的國際關係非常密切。所以我們對於最近歐洲局勢的發展也應予以相當的注意。</p>
<p>在遠東戰事發生後歐洲局勢的重要發展是法西斯的德意二國已乘機向和平之神作更進一步的挑戰。一方面擴展他們的勢力。一方面替他們遠東的法西斯同志遙為聲援。這種挑戰的事實。主要的是下列兩項。</p>
<p>第一。德意更公開的干涉西班牙內戰。德意的帮助弗蘭哥叛軍。干涉西國內戰本是公開的秘密但是最近却更加明顯了。當意大利黑衫軍攻下桑坦特城時。弗蘭哥竟電墨沙里尼表示感謝慶賀之意。而黑衫首相也公然承認。並祝叛軍前途勝利這種公開的干涉在以前是少見的。</p>
<p>第二。地中海上屢次出現神祕潛艇。襲擊各國商船與軍艦蘇聯商船被擊沉者就達二艘之多。其他被襲擊而未受損者更不可計數這種海盜行為顯然是地中海上某一國家所為因此蘇聯於事發之後。卽直接向意大利提出二次抗議而英法等國也對這種海盜行為嚴予痛斥。</p>
<p>法西斯國家這種挑戰的行動當然是愛好和平的國家所不能忍受的。因此在桑坦特陷落後。法國卽主張召開國際干涉委員會。向意國提出抗議。但後來因見於這種行動未能發生實效。而地中海的形勢又非常緊張。於是卽聯合英國邀請蘇土意德等十二國在尼翁召開會議討論制裁地中海上海盜行為的辦法。但意大利根本是很有嫌疑的國家。對於這種於己不利的會議。自然不願參加於是卽藉口拒絕而德國也與意國採取一致行動拒不參加。不過英法蘇土等國非但不因德意拒絕而不召開會議。而且還很快的商妥三種具體辦法。制裁海盜行為的再度發生。而保各國商船的安全。英法等國在尼翁會議中所採的堅决態度。自然是對法西斯挑戰國家一個重大的打擊。</p>
<p>法西斯國家對於尼翁會議的决定辦法。是否表示尊重。而不再從事海盜行爲。現在尚不可知。假如德意現有沒有立刻挑起歐洲大戰的决心諒來總不敢再像過去一樣的野蠻行事。但是德意現在是否沒有燃起大戰導火綫的意思呢。這問題因關係過大。很難加以斷定。不過就他們的挑戰行動說。他們是早已向這大火山口邁步前進了。德意二國間已在去年結成法西斯的軸心。最近黑衫首相又擬於二十五日訪問德國同希特勒會晤這二巨頭的會晤。是斷不會商出好事來的。</p>
<p>歐洲法西斯的挑戰行動。一方面是在擴展他們自已的勢力。而一方面却是響應遠東兇手的進攻中國。因為德日防共協定早已成立。而意日防共協定也不久卽可簽訂。這種國際法西斯的聯合。對於世界和平將是一個極大的打擊。因在世界上愛好和平的國家。都應一致立卽聯合起來。結成堅固的集體安全制度。來制裁這破壤和平的國際集團。</p>
<h3>德元首重申收回舊屬地要求</h3>
<p>謂此一問題不解决　歐洲局勢難望安定</p>
<p>［柏林］德國元首希特勒今日與新聞記者縱談國內及國際開題、承認德國頗有糧食缺乏之虞、並謂殖民地之支配問題、如不能解决、歐洲局勢卽難安定、希氏並未提出德國欲收回何處屬地、惟堅稱德國被奪之屬地、在道德上有收回之權利、希氏亦鄭重聲明、德國並無備戰之計創、且力促各國善待國內之少數民族云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］據法國記者報告、德元首希特勒、昨日在紐倫堡、接見外國記者、作非正式談話時、曾發表若干重要申明、當哈瓦斯社提出關於殖民地問題一節、希氏表稱堅信此項問題、將來必能自動解决、猶之乎過去平權問題之自動解决、然希氏聲稱、“此為合手理性之事、余深信理性終必勝利、同時此為關乎吾人榮譽之事、因德國人民幷非希望移入他國、僅要求歸還原有殖民地、幷非從他國手中、奪為己有、”繼而英國記者問、“德國是否將在殖民地、建立海軍根據地、”希氏答曰、“必有强大艦隊、乃需要海軍根據地、戰前德國擴張殖民地、完全為經濟之動機、對於軍事上之觀點、未加考盧、今甘如欲以陸軍保護遼遠殖民地、則不惟徒勞無功、且亦不可能”云、（十三日海通電）</p>
<p>⊙紐倫堡　德元首希特勒頃在本城古堡大禮堂中、延見德國與外國各報記者、元首着褐色襯衫、當與各該記者一一握手、狀至懇摯、並發表談話、其扼要一語、係謂“關於殖民地問題、終須覓得一種方式予以解决、有如軍備平等權利問題之卒歸解决者然、總之、殖民地問題、苦一日不解决、則歐洲時局、卽一日無眞正綏靖之可能、”元首又告各記者云、余在八日之中、前後發表演說十一次、並有數次係在十餘萬人前發言、殊感疲乏、“一俟國社黨大會結束之後、余當前往慕尼黑城、並赴貝許斯德加登鎭、稍作休憇、然後遄返柏林、”</p>
<p>意相聘德用意</p>
<p>有人叩以意首相墨索里尼聘問德國之意義、是否僅欲再度申明柏林羅馬政治軸心之强固、抑或尚有更為重要之用意、元首答稱、“就意相來聘一項事實言之、其意義頗為明顯、無待辭費、各國對於吾人意向均懷疑慮、但吾人現極安靜、無所動作、旣不願攘取任何人所有之物、亦不欲凌駕任何外國民族之上、吾國之種族主義如此而已、明乎此、種種疑慮、當可渙燃消釋也、</p>
<p>軍備恢復平等</p>
<p>抑歐戰結束以還至一九三三年為止、在此十四年中、德國之在歐洲不啻成一𦉌隙、但國社黨秉政之徒、此種情形已不復存在、吾人業已恢復軍備平等權利、而將罅隙妥予填滿、歐洲不安全之因素、從此為之消滅、吾人乃可以致力於各項主要職責矣、</p>
<p>糧食缺乏堪虞</p>
<p>此種職責至為繁重、而以糧食問題尤為重要、德國所產糧食、不足儘人民之需要、所缺數量為百分之十乃至十二、質言之、卽德國有七百萬人缺乏糧食是也、此項問題倘欲圓滿解决、自非德國取獲殖民地不可、吾人須知此事、並非和平或戰爭問題、而僅係理智問題、余深信理智終必獲得勝利也、﹂</p>
<p>殖民地所蘄求</p>
<p>至是、英國某報記者叩以德國取獲殖民地之後、是否將作馬海軍根據地、希特勒元首微笑答曰、“此層倘欲實行、必先置有充分之海軍而後可、溯當歐戰之前、德國開發殖民地、僅爲發展商業、而並無軍略用意存乎其間、蓋養兵以保衛遼遠殖民地、非計之得者也、某記者又叩以德國何不從商務方面着手、以解决殖民地問題、元首答稱、“就商務言之、各國倘向德國儘量購貨、德國亦當向各該國儘量購買貨物、以為報答、但殖民地問題非僅商務問題、而實有關德國之榮譽、吾國人民現不願離本國、而與外國人生息一處、亦不僅欲經商、而願受本國國旗之保護、彼英國比利時西班牙葡萄牙日本均有殖民地、吾國何獨不可有之、抑吾人並未要求地國土地、所蘄求者、亦惟收回吾國往昔殖民地而已、”</p>
<p>少數民族問題</p>
<p>嗣談及他國境內少數民族問題、則謂德國並無帝國主義的野心、“吾人僅望他國當局對於境內德國少數民族予以公允之待遇、有如南斯拉夫政府之所為、該國境內德國少數民族七八十萬人、對於所處地位現均感覺滿意、可為明證、”</p>
<p>致力建設事業</p>
<p>最後元首談及德國政府在國內所實施之公共工程計劃、例如建造汽車公路、並於一九四五年在慕尼黑城·一九五○年在柏林。擧行國際博覽會之類、並謂“其他各國倘均有此種偉大計劃、幷埋首工作、十年以至二十年有如吾人所為、則世界卽可靖平矣”云云、（中央社十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>尼翁協定卽日生效</h3>
<p>英法政策勝利　歐局轉趨和緩</p>
<p>［日內瓦］尼翁九國協定於星期六日成立後、英國將担任遺派驅逐艦卅五艘、法國亦將担任廿五艘、共同巡遲地中海、以保障航運之安全、而在海軍根據地馬爾太與直布羅陀兩區附近、除驅函艦外、並有飛機襄助巡遲、英法海軍專家相信尼翁協定之僅僅簽字、已足發生制止海盜行動之效力、故此協定雖自明日起實施為效、然未必有施用武力之必要也、同時意德兩國因地中海巡邏工作未有蘇聯加入、為之慰、目前德意報紙皆抱海欣盜行爲、蘇聯實負其責之態度、據羅馬消息、地中海任何辦法、茍不使意國與他國處於完全同等之地位、則意國不欲遵守之、大約在西亂不干涉委員會集議以前、意國未必遽作關於參加尼翁協定事之决定、又據紐倫堡消息、德國各界對於蘇聯外長李維諾夫在尼翁所演說之各節、表示憤憊、甚至有德國從此不復與李維諾夫同列議席之建議、惟蘇聯共產黨機關眞理報則對於李維諾夫大加崇揚、謂意國盜藏匿於“國籍不明”之煙幕彈後、但此假面具現已為李氏所揭開矣、蘇聯願完全贊助尼翁會議保障地中海航運安全之次議、苟意國海盜毀傷蘇聯船隻而殺害其人民、蘇聯定將採行其自已計畫、（中央社路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］今晨英國各報皆歡迎地中海方案、認為處理潛艇威脅之切合實際的辦法、泰晤士報稱、尼翁會議以極迅速之手腕、成立協定、而其所採用之計晝、又具有實事求是之性質、故責難尼翁會議者為之默然無言、英法海軍顧問已樹立一種辦法、可使中立國船隻往來於地中海兩大航路者、免再遭潛艇暴行矣、英代表在尼翁所表示之奮勉、與英政府扶助地中海弱國之凖備、皆甚可嘉向云、每日電聞報稱、任何政府决不能對於尼翁協定所規定之海軍措施、提出反對、意德兩國咸已宣佈其對於尼翁全議旨趣之同情今會笑迎决議、旣已證明其絕無在西班牙內戰中有何偏袒之處、世人乃期望意德同情、終可成為切實贊助云、（中央社十三日路透電）</p>

<h3>前綫歸來</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>一片焦土的閘北好比紅粉骷髏　曾建殊勳的旅長關懷國際局勢</p>
<p>平時由租界去閘北，頭頭是道，好像由外院進內室，眞是“便當來些”；如今砲火連天的時期，却難於上靑天了。但包謂的難，並非指如蜀道的崎嶇不平，而是說兩界密邇，僅有一綫可通的幽徑，若無熟人引導，便將無從問津·前夜眞湊巧得很，在友人駱亦文君處，碰着某部主任王伯雄君，承他引導着去完成了視察閘北的目的。</p>
<p>我們由某處快要出發的時候，英勇可佩的童子軍，忽捉來一個拿着一大紮巨額“盧布”廢票，在街頭瞻望的嫌疑漢奸·經檢查結果，證明他是某師黨生隊的落伍兵。盧布是江　拾得，幸而不是敵人的金元票。他有個哥哥，已是一二八抗戰殉國的烈士，他此次隨軍遠征,還想兼報兄仇哩！最後的發落，是將他附搭醫愈傷兵歸隊車，送行前綫服務．他高興了連嘴都合不攏來。他說：他决定要求長官掉換職務，讓他衝到敵綫去翻本！點名上車，有人妄問了一句：“剛才那個漢奸那裏去了”？不料車廂中便發出電一般的抗議聲：“在這里——在這里，不過，那個忘八龜兒才是漢奸”！這話剛引起了哄堂的大笑，我們的車子，也就嬌嬌的向前開步走了。</p>
<p>前綫次去的戰地，大多数是荒郊，間或是小鎮，孤村，會使人感到砲聲的輕鬆，火光的暗流·這间去的閘北，她原是個洋樓高聳，馬路平滑，工商發達，人烟稠密的繁華都市·照一般常理說：雖不幸她已被戰种魔掌抓住了，但被蹂躪的日子還不久，而且她的秉賦優厚，似乎她的容顏該不會怎樣的改變．可是在事實上，不幸是閘北，她慘罹了這次敵人殘暴瘋狂的砲火，不僅改變了容顏．簡直成了大時代犧牲下的紅粉骷髏了！</p>
<p>在這紅粉骷髏似的閘北之夜，首先給你的深刻印𧰼，便是陰森可怕的黑暗。汽車上的電炬，不許開放了手電筒也同樣的不得放光，早知不帶來，也落個清閒．有時當空突然爆放出飄蕩着的照明彈，光耀我方陣地，那你只好下車側避，屏息靜聽敵機的嗡嗡聲。三四分鐘後，依然又恢復了常時間的陰森；黑暗。走着走着，更有紛亂電綫的絆輪，廢垣頽牆的當道；又有新燒房屋，餘燼未熄，烟臭氤氲，無從掩鼻通過．偌大的一個區域自然也有不少的里衖樓房，金甌無恙，得刊意外的倖存。可是雞犬無聲，人影不見（哨兵當然也不易發現），沉靜寂滅，儼若夜半獨行深山和野阱。□□□一帶肉搏巷戰的槍彈聲，轉灣繞角，陣陣傳至，好像燜在𤍠鍋裏的炒荳，愈炸愈響。分析一下：疎疎落落地　着手溜彈的，類多是我衝鋒逼進敵壘的戰士：“他董他董”地放着三八式步槍的，準是堅壁高壘憑險速射的倭寇·這些緊迫陰森的巷戰空氣，都與野戰的輕鬆砲聲，黯澹火光，顯然不同。</p>
<p>在一條深衖堂底的屋中，會見一位身先士卒，政克愛國女學的連長□□□氏，他已升任某旅旅部副官主任，據說：愛國女學之攻克與否？關係江灣區戰局勝敗極大。該連官兵，雖建此攻克大功，但經此劇烈戰爭，僅有七人不曾“掛彩”；　餘輕重傷多至五十餘人，陣亡多至六十餘人，可見犧牲之大·現敵軍野心不死，還常來反攻·前夜被我軍奪得裝甲車一輛，今夜用卡車拖運後方，黑夜相遇於途，可惜未得細加鑒賞。</p>
<p>電話中商得某旅旅長廖□□將軍的同意，由王伯雄王振甲兩主任引導，帶起鋼盔，拿着手槍，再摸索前進二十餘里，達到□□□一帶陣地視察。汽車曾兩度出險，司機人口部，誤觸把竿，為之流血。捨車步行，得遇剛出火綫換防下來的某團士兵，他們見我穿着亂通便服，不斷呼出“咦咦咦”的驚問聲。至於他們浴血苦戰的疲乏，似乎“滿不在乎”。這種沉毅堅靱的精神，眞是值得十二萬分的敬佩！</p>
<p>廖旅長體軀魁梧，態度荘重，淞滬戰幕揭開，我們得接連欣誦攻取持志大學，愛國女學，粵東中學等各重要陣地的戰報，都是他運籌帷幄，督戰疆場之所賜！廖氏年華，不過三十許人。出身武昌師大，轉入黃埔軍校四期，出綰軍符，向以勇敢善戰著稱。傳四期舉業生，目前擢任旅長者，僅他一人而已。</p>
<p>此次戰地會見，滿以為他必侃侃縱談戰事，𧗊量發揮感想，以便記者報道讀者·誰知當我提出問題之後，他却很客氣地說：“此次全面抗戰，實是一種艱苦偉大的工作·我們當軍人的，唯有服從命令，埋頭苦幹，努力應𧗊的天職，以達到渡過難關的目的。多說話，賞與事實無益。不過我歡迎你冒險前來，是想請你告訴我一些最近國際間對我被侵略國的同情啊！”</p>
<p>由這一席坦白誠摯的話，尤足見廖氏學有根底，器度偉大，前綫有將如此，對於戰事勝利，眞是希望無窮。他雖未發表正式談話，但我認爲他這樣的態度，對於我們精神上的感召，更比發表談話好得多！</p>

<p>— 相</p>
<p>昨日余曾言之。此次中日戰事。常全部計算。不當局部計算。當最後計算。不當臨時計算。故總結賬不知何年何月。當難預料。推卽以滬地一小部分與一月以來計之。其成績亦大可親矣。日本原是一位挑動世界大戰之魔王。其自負何等偉大。何等自誇。但大軍十萬。苦戰月餘。增兵三次其損失奇重。已可確知。據一般統計。每月耗費須五萬萬元。而在滬財產輿營業上之損夫不計。士兵之損失不計。飛機兵艦被我軍擊毀者亦不計。而其結果尚在我第一道防綫之外。這也未免太浪費矣。</p>

<h3>沈痛的回憶（三）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>㊂二十八日的勝利消息之謎</p>
<p>全盤眞象，現在早己完全表露，放在一般人面前了。亳無疑問的，七月二十八日所有的一些勝利消息，完全是不確實的·但是，最令大家引起‘謎一樣感覺的，却有兩點：一，難道所有的勝利消息，連半點踪影也沒有啊？三，什麽地方傳出這些不確實消息來的呢？又是為的什麼？</p>
<p>對於第一點，我想，祇要我們把當天的眞實戰況，約略敘述一下，就會完全解答的。</p>
<p>二十七號，冀察當局和日方進行的‘和平’談判，宣告了最後的失敗·當天，來哲元氏發表他的最後聲明，調：本人努力和平苦心，為一般共見，但努力已告失敗．以後一切大計，當聽中央主持，祇有請全體居民，力持鎭定，共赴國難·等語，云云。當天夜裏，津，浦，平漢，以及北平，通州間的戰事，同時爆發。這三路．全是我方取的攻勢，爭奪地點，平漢綫上，是宛平，盧溝橋一帶，津浦綫上，是豐台廊房一帶，平通間是冀東偽組織的老巢通縣·像這樣攻勢出擊的戰略，不用說，直可是遵着中央所指示的趁機就近解决敵人華北駐屯軍·’那樣方針上做去了．不過，可惜的是，時間已經遲了兩個多禮拜！兩個禮拜前的敵人實力，和這時比，已經增加了許多倍·所以，敵人除分頭應付我們的進攻外，同時又結集兵力，向北平近郊，分三路猛攻：南面一路，是對着南苑一帶，西面是西郊一帶，北面，是沙河一帶，當天，在直徑不到一百里的圓圈地域內，同時發生戰事的，幾乎有十處左右。這一次，雙方所川的戰略，都是非常厲害的：假如我軍各路勝利，那末，敵人在平津一帶的陣勢，有一直被逼到關外去的可能：反過來，假如敵人勝利，北平立刻失去的話，那末，我們在華北的陣勢，就不得不分為三路，向平綏·平漢·津浦等樣，分頭退去了·這一天，我們在平漢綫上作戰的，是三十七師馮治安部下，在津浦綫上的，是五十三軍萬福麟部下，加上馮治安的一部，向通州方面进攻的，是趙登禹部下，在南苑應戰的，是成立訓練不久的敎導團，在西郊的，是馮治安部下的何基豐旅，在沙河方面應戰的，是石友三的冀北保安隊。總計各處戰事，我軍取攻勢的三路，平漢綫無大勝負，津浦綫上我軍確會佔領豐台車站二小時，至於敵人軍營，因爲電網·地雷和其他防禦工事太堅，衝鋒十一次，總沒有攻下，所以不久連車站也佔領不住了·通縣這一路，我們原先就有一營人住在通縣西門外，戰事一開始，我們增援太慢，而又不趁早調開，所以慘被敵人消滅，我軍進攻部隊，和敵人在平通之間遭遇，發生激戰，勝負不分·然而，敵人向我軍進攻的三路，却非常之糟了：首先，在南苑方面，這是二十九軍軍部所在地，副軍長佟麟閣就駐在那裏，然而，却一點防禦工事也沒有，除去一圈土圲子和壕溝以外，什麼都沒有了。而尤其奇怪的在事先，彷彿連這裏會發生戰事的事，也完全不知道。所以，當敵人排列着重砲向南苑進攻時，我們駐在南苑的敎導團，立刻就完全陷入了手足無所措的狀態：土圩子在大砲飛機轟炸下，不久就摧平了，部下找不着官長，官長找不着部下，於是，這三千多名從沒有作過戰的敎導隊，（他們都是高中或初中畢業的靑年）·就祇有憑着血肉之軀，各自爲職，和敵人的大砲飛機拚命了·結果，死傷了兩千多，逃出的是很少的一部·而身兼敎導團團長的佟麟閣，以及馮玉祥公子馮國維君，段祺瑞的孫公子段君，都也跟着葬身在內·對於這種壯烈的犧牲精神本身，我們除肅然起敬外，還敢再說什麼呢？不過，像這種不計效果的犧牲，毫無準備的犧牲，我們覺得太慘了，太兒戲人命了！與其這樣糊糊塗塗地犧牲，反不如趁早調開，倒可以保全國家民族一部份有作為的靑年，也就是多留下一股元氣，南苑是二十八日下午失守的·這麼一來，北平已經和平漢路我軍斷了聯繋，而有三面陷在敵人包圍裏了，西苑方面，我軍作戰很勇，雖然在敵人大砲，飛機，終日夾攻下，忠勇的何基豐旅，還能支待，到夜裏，宋哲元氏等高級人員退走後，才撤退的·沙河方面，石友三部隊，在敵人重壓下，一連敗了兩仗，向西南潰退：而最奇怪的，駐紮在北苑的三十八師張自忠部下的阮玄武旅，竟大部按兵不動，袖手旁觀·戰事發展到二十八號夜裏，我軍完全成為劣敗的地位，北平那時，在戰路上，祇有兩條路可走：一條是放棄，另一條，是將四郊所有已潰未潰武力，完全調進城，加上城裏的憲·警·保安隊等萬餘人，作最後的困守，等待我軍的營救。然而宋哲元氏却取走的第一條路。——於是，北平失陷了。</p>
<p>山當天戰况上看，可以說是完全慘敗，那裏有什麼勝利可言！一切勝利消息，皆是毫無踪影的。</p>
<p>那末，什麽地方傳出這些不確實消息來的呢？有什麼作用呢？</p>
<p>首先受一班人責難的，是新聞記者。他們因失望而怨恨，不　以為新聞記者的話完全靠不住，甚至懷疑到他們是受了別人的收買，罵他們沒有人格．我有一位朋友，就憤憤地大聲宣稱着：一以後永遠不看這些造謠的報紙了！</p>
<p>其實，把這一同虛假消息的責任，放在記者們身上，那是完全寃枉的。爲着要解答這個問題，我們必須把當天北平的實際情形、敘述一下。</p>
<p>二十七號夜裏起，一直到二十八號夜裏，這期間，北平週遭，完全被槍砲聲瀰漫着，不獨辨不出雙方的勝負，連每一聲所自來的方向，也辨不淸楚了。城門除一兩個為運輸軍隊外，其餘完全關閉着·城外就是火綫，而頭緒又非常紛繁，實地探訪消息的事，完全不可能了。這時，消息的來源，祇有幾處：一，向來負對外公告責任的官方機關，二，半官性質的機關，（如進德社等類）·及與戰事或官方有關聯的個人，三，外人使館方面。</p>
<p>比如豐台收復這個消息，大家本來早已聽到了，但，一直等到從進德社綏靖公署方面，正式徵實，並山德國使館某武官方面證實後，才山某報首先印售號外。其餘消息，雖來源各有不同，但也總不外這幾個方面。雖然如此，也絕不能說，每一個消息的最初來源，就是上述這三方面。有的時候，他們往往也是從別的方面聽到，加以描述。所以，有許多消息，是經過了多次輾轉傳吿和改變原來面目，才印到報紙上，公佈給讀者們的。像這種查不淸來源的消息，也非常之釣；不過比起來，還是有正式來源的多些。</p>
<p>至於傳出這些消息的作用問題，我想，倒有大部份，是山於滿足大家內心的希望和幻想，因而就自覺或不覺地，大家輾轉傳述着的時候，使牠們漸漸誇大了，越說越像眞的了·自然，另有一小部份，也是某一方面為的要掩蔽他們的退却．不過，無論前者後者，總是愚蠢和笨拙的，和第二天那樣情景一對照時，我們總覺得，我們中華民族在這裏鬧了一個笑柄·這，眞是令人哭笑不得的事！</p>

        <h1>1937.09.14</h1>
<h3>Our Troops Automatically Withdrew to the First Line of Defense According to Plan</h3>
<p>The purpose is to get rid of the threat of enemy naval gunfire. The new positions on this line have been carefully arranged. The enemy once attacked Liuhang but was repelled by our forces.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that a spokesperson for our army stated that since the beginning of the Shanghai battle, our side has actively taken the offensive in areas such as Hongkou and Yangshupu, and the enemy's positions have become increasingly cramped. Our side had long anticipated that after the enemy reinforcements, they would inevitably repeat the old trick of January 28th, using the superior naval firepower along the Yangtze River estuary to cover the landing. Our army had already decided on a plan for operations along the river, launching courageous attacks at the time of their landing to inflict heavy losses and prolong their time. After they landed, they would be prevented from communicating with each other. Now this plan has been implemented step by step. The losses suffered by the enemy are unprecedented. Now that the goal has been achieved, since the day before yesterday, we have automatically withdrawn to the first line of defense according to the planned schedule. The purpose is to gradually get rid of the threat of enemy naval gunfire and introduce them to land-based positional warfare. Our army's new positions were arranged last night. There will be major developments in the war from now on.</p>
<p>Reliable sources report that since the situation in Yanghang and Yuepu became tense, our army has immediately held on to the new positions and built solid defensive works to avoid the enemy's naval power and vowed to annihilate the enemy's strength through land warfare. Now our army, from Qingyun Road and Baziqiao in Zhabei, to Jiangwan and Miaohang, to a certain place two miles west of Yanghang, to Luodian, the new positions have been completely arranged, and we are waiting in battle, vowing to inflict heavy damage on the enemy and weaken their land combat strength.</p>
<h3>Our Troops in the City Center Moved to the North Station, Jiangwan, and Sheng Yi Area</h3>
<p>If the enemy attacks again, they will be severely hit. The remnants of the enemy in Luodian are still being strictly blocked from advancing.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that in the Battle of Yanghang, our loyal and brave soldiers fought the enemy's artillery fire with their flesh and blood, fighting fiercely for two days and nights. The front lines advanced and retreated repeatedly. Although our army had heroic sacrifices, the enemy suffered even heavier casualties due to taking the offensive and being severely hit by our forces. It is estimated that the enemy's deaths and injuries are at least three thousand people or more. After our army retreated from the Yuepu-Yanghang line, they have held firmly to the new positions in the Qijia浜 area, relying on fortifications. At the same time, the enemy, due to heavy casualties, urgently needs to reorganize and dare not advance again. Therefore, the battle in that area has become quiet yesterday. However, due to the changes in the Yanghang front line, the positions of our city center in the Yinxiang Township and Yangshupu area have become prominent and easily surrounded by the enemy. In military terms, this is an extremely unfavorable situation. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, our army moved to the first line of defense from the North Station to Jiangwan in an orderly formation yesterday morning, and took a defensive posture. The positions on this line have long been built into solid fortifications. If the enemy attacks, they will surely be able to rely on the terrain to give them a serious blow. As for the remnants of the enemy in Luodian, they are still being strictly blocked by our army and will definitely not be able to advance.</p>
<h3>Observations of Military Officials</h3>
<p>The goal is to strive for final victory. The advance and retreat of small pieces of land are not worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>According to a military official who spoke to the reporter, his observations on the Shanghai battle are: The Shanghai battle has lasted for thirty-two days since its outbreak yesterday. Our army is determined to fight a long-term war and strive for the final victory, resisting the enemy's invasion, and fighting fiercely for more than a month. The magnificence of the spirit and the greatness of the achievements have chilled the enemy's courage and shocked the world. At the beginning of the war, our army launched a fierce attack on the enemy with a heroic posture. Important enemy positions in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas were repeatedly captured by our army, destroying the old and rotten with the force of a landslide, as if breaking bamboo. Our army's vanguard once advanced far to the Huishan Wharf, cutting off the enemy's communication. We were fully prepared to take it down in one go and attack the enemy camp directly. However, the enemy continued to reinforce and harass various places along the river and coast, containing our army's offensive, resulting in failure to achieve success. When the enemy's reinforcements landed in Luodian, Yunzaobang, and Zhanghuabang on the 23rd of last month, they first used enemy naval guns to bombard our land, trying to prevent our army from entering the line of fire. Therefore, it was impossible for our army to fundamentally prevent the enemy from landing. However, our army had a magnificent spirit and irresistible momentum. Every time the enemy landed and had not yet gained a firm foothold, they would quickly attack and inflict heavy damage on them. Therefore, the enemy in the Hongkou, Yangshupu, Wusong, and Luodian areas could not connect and meet from beginning to end. The remnants of the enemy in the Luodian area were surrounded by us, which was especially embarrassing. In the fierce battles of the past three weeks, the enemy's deaths and injuries exceeded 20,000. The severity of the injuries was far above our army's. However, the enemy's forces operating in Shanghai include six army divisions, about 10,000 marines, more than 130 warships, 300 aircraft, more than 1,000 cavalry, and mechanized units. Among them, the enemy's warships are equipped with a total of 700 large-caliber guns, and the firepower is the most powerful. Since Baoshan was broken by enemy naval gunfire and our Yao Zixiang camp was completely heroically sacrificed, the Yuepu-Xingyanghang line, our army's positions have lost their barriers. However, our army can still fight the enemy fiercely for two days and nights, inflicting heavy injuries on them before retreating. The magnificence of the spirit and the courage of the operation are far beyond what the enemy can compare. As for the retreat of the positions in the Yinxiang Township area of the city center, it was entirely to avoid being surrounded by the enemy. This is a strategic step that must be taken and is not surprising. Looking at the enemy's annihilation in the Jungong Road area in recent days, we can know that if our army makes progress on the entire line, the area will be very easy to recover. Now the first line of defense held by our army on the entire line has been built long ago, the positions are extremely solid, and they are far away from the river, and the enemy's firepower of more than 700 guns has completely lost its effectiveness, which is extremely beneficial to us. If the enemy attacks again, they should know that the strength of our loyal and brave soldiers cannot be underestimated. In short, our army is determined to fight a long-term war in order to strive for the final victory. We are not arrogant in victory, and we are not discouraged in defeat. At present, the advance and retreat of small pieces of land are not worth paying attention to in the entire war situation.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Army in Yanghang Attacked Liuhang</h3>
<p>Our army strictly defended the original front line. The enemy has retreated to the western suburbs of Yanghang.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the enemy used all its strength to advance westward from Yanghang, attempting to spy on Liuhang. Our army built defensive works in the new positions near Donglu, strictly rejecting the enemy's invasion. The sound of guns and cannons gradually became dense in the morning, and contact occurred on the front line. It stopped after ten o'clock. It was heard that the enemy's attack had been repelled to the western suburbs of Yanghang. Our army strictly defended the original front line, waiting for an opportunity to attack. On the Zhanghuabang side, 2,000 enemy troops attacked Sitang River yesterday. After resisting by our defending soldiers, the two armies approached before long, and were about to engage in close combat. Our army protruded from the front line and used broadswords and hand grenades to fight back, killing many enemies. The enemy was defeated and retreated, and our army did not pursue, but advanced into the South Sitang River.</p>
<h3>Our Army in Yuepu is Waiting for an Opportunity to Counterattack</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the enemy on the Wusong side, since the 10th, has used strong artillery fire to attack our Yanghang line. Yanghang Town has become a scorched earth under intense artillery fire. After several counterattacks by our army, it safely moved to the new front line. The enemy, with heavy casualties, is also reorganizing and replenishing, and has not dared to advance. Therefore, the battle on that line was silent the night before (12th). Fresh troops have been transferred to prepare for a counterattack. As for Yuepu, due to the local environment of Yanghang, it also abandoned the original front line and held on to the new positions, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack, in order to coordinate with the front of Yanghang.</p>
<h3>The Battle of Luodian and Liuhe is Silent</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the enemy in Luodian, the day before yesterday (12th) in the afternoon, used small guerrilla teams to attack us in separate ways. Our army bravely fought back. The enemy's small team leader, Jing San, was killed on the spot. A diary was found on his body. It was learned that the enemy in Luodian was the Twelfth Division of Weiliumi. The line between Luodian and Liuhe was relatively silent the night before last.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Enemy Troops Landed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that before dawn yesterday morning, two enemy merchant ship-transformed transport ships sailed into the Huangpu River. One, the "Tottori Maru," docked at the Osaka Wharf, and about 1,000 enemy troops landed. The other, the "Kasa Maru," docked at the China Merchants Bureau Zhongzhan, unloading military supplies, which had not been completed until 6 pm yesterday. After 1 pm, three more enemy transport ships, the "Tenyo Maru," the "Tairiku Maru," and the "Totai Maru," successively sailed in and docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, Osaka Wharf, and Huangpu Wharf, respectively. In addition to about 2,000 enemy troops landing, a large number of heavy military equipment, such as tanks, armored vehicles, heavy artillery, and other military supplies, were continuously transported. The enemy's continuous reinforcements in Hongkou and Yangshupu are expected to have fierce counterattacks in those areas within days.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bombed and Sunk Three Refugee Boats in Beixinjing Again</h3>
<p>The Yujidun River surface was almost blocked by corpses. The number of deaths and injuries was more than 300 again.</p>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) Yesterday afternoon at about 4 o'clock, several enemy planes flew to Beixinjing, a non-military zone, and wantonly bombed. At that time, six civilian boats full of refugees were seen passing through the Suzhou River surface at Yujidun, about seven or eight miles west of Beixinjing. The enemy planes dropped four heavy bombs, causing three of them to be sunk. At that time, the innocent refugees tragically drowned and the corpses of those who were bombed to death. The river section was almost blocked. The number was more than several hundred. The tragic situation was unbearable to witness. The water patrol detachment in charge immediately sent police to take care of it. Because the place is located in a remote rural area, the transportation is very inconvenient. In addition, after the enemy planes dropped the bombs, they stayed for a long time and frequently flew low to strafe with machine guns. Therefore, the ambulances of various charitable organizations in the city could not go to rescue. It was not until about 9 pm last night that two trucks went to carry more than 40 injured refugees and sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>According to a report from a rescue organization, yesterday afternoon, the International Refugee Camp and the Suzhou Association hired a Gongxin small steamer to tow a dozen civilian boats to Jiaxing. Another Xie Mao steamer towed twelve pairs of boats to Suzhou. At 4:30, when they were about eight miles west of our Beixinjing, two enemy planes suddenly flew low to scout and circled several times, and then dropped two heavy bombs. At that time, the boats towed by the Gongxin and Xie Mao steamers were untied separately. The enemy planes dropped two more bombs. At that time, a total of three civilian boats were sunk, and the number of deaths and injuries totaled more than 300. The rescue team rushed to rescue and sent the injured to Renji and other hospitals for emergency treatment. The situation was extremely tragic.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, enemy planes bombed and sank three refugee boats in Beixinjing yesterday and destroyed six others. They were towed by small steamers heading to Jiaxing. Another small steamer heading to Suzhou left later and was fortunate enough to escape.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Situation of Enemy Ships Mooring</h3>
<p>About forty ships in the Wusongkou area. About forty ships in Shidong and Liuhe.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that according to the results of the reporter's investigation yesterday, there are about sixty enemy ships in the river area around Wusongkou (from the Qiujiang Wharf to the Lion Grove), including about forty cruisers, destroyers, and gunboats. The rest are transport ships converted from enemy merchant ships. The number of enemy ships in the river area around Shidong and Liuhe has increased sharply in recent days, and the total number should be more than forty. It is expected that fierce battles will occur there within days. As for the enemy ships in the Huangpu River, in addition to the five transport ships, there are a total of twelve enemy ships. The mooring situation is as follows: One destroyer No. 21 and one destroyer No. 11 at the Mitsubishi Wharf (this ship was originally No. 17, and suddenly the number "11" was added to the stern. The enemy ships change their numbers from time to time, which can be seen from this.) One destroyer No. 3 at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, one floating gunboat each of Nos. 40, 36, 22, 17, and 10, one floating destroyer each of Nos. 9 and 7, one flagship Izumo floating gunboat No. 3, and one destroyer No. 18 floating gunboat No. 1, a total of twelve ships. All the ships in the Huangpu River were very quiet yesterday. Only the enemy ships outside Qiujiang Wharf fired westward to bombard our positions.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Enemy Planes' Rampage Yesterday</h3>
<p>Specializing in destroying commercial and civilian houses and burning property unrelated to combat.</p>
<p>Dozens of enemy planes wantonly bombed Zhabei, Nanshi, Pudong, and Nanxiang all day yesterday, and the situation was extremely tragic. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Pudong</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 1:40, two small teams of six enemy planes flew to the Bailianjing area of Pudong and dropped more than ten bombs. Then, at about 3 o'clock, five enemy planes flew again and dropped more than thirty bombs. A total of about fifty bombs were dropped in two times. The China Alcohol Factory across from the Dalei Company warehouse in that area was hit by more than twenty bombs, and the factory was bombed and destroyed. (The factory is about three or four miles around and has only been open for three years.) Eighteen bombs hit the nearby countryside, destroying thirty or forty civilian houses. Seven or eight bombs also hit the Yitai Coal Warehouse South Warehouse. Two bombs were also dropped at the South Wharf of Pudong, destroying dozens of bungalows. Although the Dalei Warehouse was fortunate not to be hit by bombs, its walls were damaged by shrapnel, with bullet marks. There were more than thirty workers and civilians injured. Dozens of people were killed on the spot. The injured were sent to the Pudong Red Cross Society in that area for rescue and treatment.</p>
<p>The area near Lujiazui in Pudong was attacked by two enemy planes dropping multiple incendiary bombs at about 4 pm yesterday. The civilian houses there immediately caught fire, and the fire spread fiercely for a while, with billowing smoke soaring into the sky. By about 4:30, two more enemy planes flew to drop two bombs. By about 5:30, the fire subsided slightly, and then it was extinguished.</p>
<p>Nanshi</p>
<p>At 1:30 yesterday afternoon, enemy bombers flew out, totaling seven. Four of them flew to the Bailianjing area of Nanhupu Dongnan Huangpu, and the other three dropped more than ten bombs in the Xuejiabang rice wharf and Dama Wharf area of Nanshi. However, very few exploded. After bombing the wharves along the Huangpu River in Nanshi, the enemy planes dropped bombs outside the Dadongmen and Xiaonanmen near the city, lasting for two hours. At about 4 pm, three enemy bombers reappeared over the ring city and dropped seven or eight bombs on the side near the wharf outside the eastern half of the city. The area of No. 16 Dongmen Road was also hit by two bombs. The Nanhua Commercial Tram Company at the Nanshi Station and the Xinpu Yutang on Guohuo Road were each hit by two bombs, but there were few deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>Zhabei</p>
<p>At about 7 am yesterday, five enemy planes flew to the Gonghe Xinlu area of Zhabei and dropped more than a dozen incendiary bombs. The Zhenanli area was the first to be hit and immediately caught fire. The fire was raging for a while and spread rapidly, making it impossible to control. Although the fire brigades of Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Zhabei drove to the scene to put out the fire, it was difficult to put out the fire because the river water was scarce. Then, at about 11 o'clock, fires broke out on Jinling Road and Datong Road, etc., and the situation became more intense. The fire brigades of the northwest and second districts of Hunanqu and the second district of Dongjiadu also opened the alarm and drove to the scene to help put out the fire bravely. Later, there were as many as four fire sites in that area, from East Datong Road to the western Jinling Road Maigen Road Station warehouse, and the fire area spread for several miles. The fire was only slightly suppressed until about 5 pm.</p>
<p>Nanxiang</p>
<p>Nanxiang Town has been bombed by enemy planes for several days in a row, and the essence has already been turned into scorched earth. However, on the morning of the day before yesterday, seven enemy planes bombed the Xianghua Bridge and South Street in the town, which are known for their mutton and small steamed bun markets, for an hour. The most prosperous South Street Xianghua Bridge in the town has been completely turned into scorched earth, and many civilians have been killed and injured.</p>
<h3>Big Fire in Hongkou and Yangshupu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, houses in the Yinxiang Township area of Yangshupu were hit by shells and burned fiercely. The fire spread again and subsided slightly at noon. At about 3 pm, civilian houses in the Hongkou Wusong Road North Sichuan Road, Laobazi Road, Outer Hongqiao, and East Xihuade Road area suddenly caught fire, with smoke soaring into the sky and sparks splashing everywhere. The situation was extremely fierce and had not been extinguished until about 6 pm.</p>
<h3>Rescue Work is Urgent and Requires Cooperation Between Officials and the Public</h3>
<p>Lack of medical equipment for wounded soldiers. The Chinese people should donate generously as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News said that the war correspondent, Mr. Tertman, vividly recorded the plight of the Chinese wounded soldiers. The North China Daily News had also commented on this matter before. Mr. Tertman's testimony made it even clearer. This is the urgent responsibility of the Chinese citizens of Shanghai and cannot be shirked. The achievements of the Red Cross workers have been warmly praised by Mr. Tertman. However, a large amount of money is currently needed to purchase the necessary and extremely scarce items for treating the wounded soldiers. It is understood that those Chinese who respect their country and reputation will be able to express sympathy for this action and donate generously. In the past, other countries also felt that the medical comfort items needed by the wounded soldiers were actually insufficient depending solely on official sources, and still needed to be supplemented by sources outside the official ones. The Red Cross was actually established when it felt that the official power was limited. Although Shanghai is now suffering from war, it is still rich in resources. It is hoped that enthusiastic and powerful Chinese people will quickly rise up to assist the Chinese groups that are currently concerned about the wounded soldiers, so as to reduce the shortcomings. Mr. Tertman's remarks describing the loyalty and bravery of the Chinese soldiers have been confirmed by various independent parties. A gentleman once went to the wounded soldiers' hospital and heard a Chinese soldier with a lung injury ask his commander when he could go home. Upon questioning, his so-called "home" was the trenches on the front line. Alas, those who have such a spirit of loyalty and bravery, after being injured, cannot obtain the basic methods of medical treatment and rescue due to simple equipment. This will be a sin for the Chinese compatriots who stand by and watch.</p>
<h3>Our Forward Soldiers Guarding Heroic Postures</h3>

<h3>The British Chargé d'Affaires Will Go to Beijing This Morning</h3>
<p>Notified both China and Japan before departure. Western newspapers reported secret talks with Kawagoe.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen has not recovered since being injured by Japanese planes. The British government has specially appointed Mr. Holman, a counselor of the embassy who is on vacation in England, to come to China at full speed. During the ambassador's recovery period, he will serve as the chargé d'affaires. Mr. Holman has arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. In order to pay a visit to our diplomatic authorities, he specially took a car to Beijing with military attaché Fraser at 3:30 this morning. It is expected to arrive at about 2 pm. It is said that in order to avoid accidents, Mr. Holman notified both China and Japan before departure and painted the British national emblem on the top of the car.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that Mr. Holman, the former counselor of the British Embassy in Beiping and now the British chargé d'affaires in China, visited Mr. Kawagoe, the Japanese ambassador to China, at his residence in Shanghai at 10:30 on the morning of the 12th for a secret talk of one hour. The issues discussed were not disclosed. Mr. Holman is scheduled to take a car to Beijing with Mr. Fraser, the military attaché of the British Embassy, on the 14th. According to reports, Mr. Holman joined the British Embassy in 1934. When Sir Cadogan handed over and returned home, Mr. Holman took over the duties of the embassy before Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen took office. Mr. Holman served in the British Army in the European War. In 1919, he worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Recently, due to Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's injury, he rushed to Shanghai to handle diplomatic affairs on behalf of the Duke. After arriving in Shanghai, he immediately reviewed all diplomatic files overnight in order to obtain clues to the overall situation.</p>
<h3>Battalion Commander Mei Zhiwei Heroically Died</h3>
<p>Battalion Commander Mei Zhiwei of a certain battalion in Pudong was unusually loyal and brave. He always took the lead in battle. In the Pudong area, he would always strike and repel the enemy's coming to spy on them. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, enemy ships used dense artillery fire to cover the army and attempted to land at the Mitsubishi Wharf in Pudong. Our army calmly responded to the battle. Battalion Commander Mei also led the machine gun team to strafe. The enemy soldiers were unsuccessful. During the fierce battle, Battalion Commander Mei was unfortunately injured by a shell. He was escorted by the rescue team to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. Due to serious injuries, he died on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, that is, at 1:30 pm on the 12th. When he was dying, he still asked about the front-line battle situation. He died with such a heroic spirit. His name will last forever.</p>

<h3>The 18th Session of the League of Nations Assembly Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Prime Minister of the West Served as Temporary Chairman and Delivered a Speech. The Obligations of the Sacred Covenant Should Be Respected. No Representatives From Italy and Abyssinia Attended.</p>
<p>[Geneva] The 18th regular session of the International League Assembly opened at 11:25 this morning. Representatives from 44 countries attended. Neither Abyssinia nor Italy sent representatives to attend. The chairman of the Executive Yuan, Prime Minister Negrin of the Spanish Republican government, served as temporary chairman and delivered an opening speech, which said: "Spain's belief in the League of Nations has not been shaken at all, and it is even more so than in the past. However, the various sacred principles of the League of Nations Covenant, most of which have been repeatedly violated, are regrettable. I think that revising the covenant may not make the implementation of the covenant more convenient, because the organization of the League of Nations and the respect for its covenant are all from the will of mankind. The politicians of some countries often hesitate to fulfill their covenant obligations, then even a very perfect covenant will not help." He continued, "The League of Nations is still very active. The work carried out by the League of Nations in the past year, such as the autonomous system of the two cities of Yaan in Syria, the Palestine issue, the raw material issue, and the economic issue, are too numerous to mention." In conclusion, he said, "The main principles of the League of Nations Covenant are nothing more than two points: good faith and respect for international constraints. Then the General Assembly adjourned until 5 pm and reopened. At that time, it will vote to elect the Chairman of the General Assembly. (Central News Agency, Havana, 13th, Havas Electric)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Delegations from various countries have arrived here today in order to participate in the opening ceremony of the 18th session of the League of Nations Assembly. The Spanish National Army has also sent an informal delegation here. The issue of recognition has arisen, but this delegation will do its best to mobilize friendly countries sympathetic to the National Army to support its overthrow of the government on the issue of re-electing the Spanish government as a member of the Executive Yuan. Indian representative Agha Khan will be elected as the Chairman of the General Assembly, but Prime Minister Negrin of the Spanish Valencia government will deliver the opening speech in the capacity of acting chairman, but only discuss international events in general, without mentioning the Spanish civil war. After that, the General Assembly will vote secretly to decide the issue of Spain's qualifications as a permanent member of the Executive Yuan. Whether it can obtain the necessary two-thirds majority at that time is still a question. Although the agenda of the General Assembly today is entirely ceremonial, the Far East issue will definitely be one of the main topics. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters Electric)</p>
<h3>I Officially Lodge a Complaint with the League of Nations</h3>
<p>To Halt Japanese Aggression, Please Take Appropriate and Effective Measures</p>
<p>[Nanjing] External Affairs News: On the 12th of this month, our country's delegation to the League of Nations, headed by Chief Delegate Gu Weijun, submitted a formal letter of complaint to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. The original text is as follows: "I am now instructed by my government to respectfully request your Secretary-General to take note of the fact that Japan is using its army, navy, and air force to invade China with all its might, and is continuing to do so. This constitutes an act of aggression against China's territorial integrity and political independence. As China is a member of the League of Nations, this action clearly constitutes a case to be dealt with in accordance with Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. Furthermore, the grave situation created by Japan's acts of aggression also falls within the scope of Article 11 of the same Covenant and is thus a matter of concern to the entire League of Nations. As for the facts of this case, please refer to the Statement of Facts sent to the League of Nations by the Chinese Government, which has been forwarded by the League of Nations to all member states and to the Advisory Committee established by the Assembly of the League of Nations on February 24, 1933, in accordance with Article 3, paragraph 3 of the Covenant. In view of Japan's current relationship with the League of Nations and its actions in China, the Chinese Government believes that Article 17 of the Covenant is also applicable. However, all resolutions passed by the Assembly and the Council of the League of Nations to date regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute shall not be affected in their continued validity and binding force. I, on behalf of my government, request the application of Articles 10, 11, and 17 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, and submit to the Council of the League of Nations a clear account of the situation as stipulated in the aforementioned articles, proposing appropriate and necessary measures to take appropriate and necessary action." (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Special dispatch from Havas News Agency's diplomatic correspondent: The main purpose of the Chinese government's complaint to the League of Nations is to revive the Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues established by the Extraordinary Assembly of the League of Nations in 1933. This committee was composed of twenty-three countries: Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, the Soviet Union, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey, Hungary, Portugal, Ireland, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Panama, and Canada. After its revival, its greatest benefit would be that the United States could also participate. The legal advisors of the Chinese government advocated re-filing this complaint because Japan declared its withdrawal from the League of Nations on March 27, 1933. Therefore, China must submit the complaint again in order to invoke the provisions of Article 17 of the Covenant regarding conflicts between member states and non-member states. In addition, the Chinese government has also invoked Articles 3 and 10 of the Covenant. According to Article 3, the Assembly of the League of Nations may deal with any matter affecting world peace. Therefore, if the Council submits a draft resolution to the Assembly after discussing the complaint submitted by China, the Assembly only needs to convene the Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues instead of forming another committee to handle it. In this way, the main purpose of the Chinese government, which is to promote a common policy of the major powers such as Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Far East, can also be achieved. Article 10 of the Covenant concerns respecting and maintaining the territorial integrity and political independence of member states, which the Chinese government has also invoked. Its benefit, from a purely theoretical perspective, is that after accepting China's complaint, the Council will certainly invite Japan to undertake the obligations of a member state in accordance with Article 17 of the Covenant in order to resolve the dispute, but Japan may not accept it. Chinese sources here recently claimed that the reason for China's complaint is to hope that "the League of Nations can proclaim to the major powers the obligations that they should bear." This hope is not extravagant. Recent probes of opinions from various parties have led to the firm belief that this can be achieved. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th, Havas)</p>
<h3>A Full Account of Japanese Military Atrocities: Full Text of Our Supplementary Statement</h3>
<p>Wanton Attacks on Non-Combatants, Use of Poison Gas, Extinction of Humanity</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a formal statement to the League of Nations on August 30 regarding the facts of Japanese aggression and atrocities, and translated and published the full text. On the 7th of this month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement, sent by telegram from our representative office to the League of Nations, which was delivered to the League of Nations on the 12th. Now, the full text of this supplementary statement is translated as follows: Since the Chinese Government submitted its first statement to the League of Nations on August 30 regarding Japan's aggression against China, Japan's aggression against China has become more serious and brutal. The lives and property of non-combatants, and even the lives and property of people from third countries, have been wantonly trampled upon, with extreme cruelty. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the Chinese Government believes that it is necessary to submit a supplementary statement, and especially hopes to pay special attention to the following important facts: ㊀ Military and political situation: Since the Japanese Marines created the Shanghai war on August 13, the Japanese army, navy, and air force have continued to reinforce, and the situation has become increasingly tense. It is estimated that in addition to the original 10,000 Marines, the Japanese army has reinforced Shanghai with a total of five divisions, equipped with the latest weapons and a large number of military aircraft. Japan is determined to contain China's first commercial port, so despite China's acceptance in principle of the proposals of third countries regarding the withdrawal of troops (including warships) from both sides, it has brazenly refused. The current battle in Shanghai has caused great sacrifice of life and property, and the confrontation between the large armies of both sides is a life-and-death battle. The battle in Shanghai is bound to be prolonged. As for North China, after the Chinese army fought bravely to defend the key point of Nankou for about two weeks, it was finally attacked by the Japanese army using poison gas, and the Kwantung Army of Japan invaded from Rehe. The Chinese army will inevitably be attacked from both sides and had no choice but to withdraw. Japan took advantage of the situation to invade westward, occupy various cities along the PingSui Railway Line, and occupy Zhangjiakou, the capital of the province of Chahar. The Chinese army in Zhangjiakou was also forced to withdraw on August 27. On September 4, the Japanese side declared that it would organize a puppet organization called the "South Chahar Autonomous Government" in the area. There was continued warfare on the northern sections of the PingHan and JinPu Railways. The strength of the Japanese army in this area is estimated to be nine divisions, no less than 150,000 men. As for the area around Tianjin and Beiping, which is under Japanese control, the order is chaotic and people are panicked. Ten foreign missionaries in Beiping were once held hostage. The Japanese military also admitted that Japanese soldiers in Beiping had repeatedly committed looting incidents and are now trying to prevent them. In order to destroy China's coastal commercial ports, Japan has now expanded its air force activities. As for South China, on August 31, Japanese aircraft used six or seven aircraft to bomb Guangzhou. On the same day, Shantou and Zhangzhou were also attacked. On September 3, after Japanese warships bombarded the Xiamen fort, Japanese seaplanes bombed Xiamen City again. On September 6, Shantou was bombed again by Japanese aircraft. In fact, throughout China, with the exception of a few provinces, there are few that have not been ravaged by the Japanese air force. When Japanese air force personnel carry out bombing and devastation, they make no distinction between combatants and non-combatants. These brutal actions will be described in detail below. ㊁ Japan Declares a Blockade of the Chinese Coast: On August 25, the Japanese Navy declared a blockade of the sea area from Shanghai to a point south of Shantou, prohibiting Chinese ships from sailing. Although Tokyo claimed that it would not interfere with the "peaceful trade" of third countries, Nobu Atsuhira, legal advisor to the Third Fleet of Japan, which is fighting in China, declared to the press that Japanese warships patrolling the blockade waters were ordered to stop foreign ships for inspection and stated that if the Japanese side considered that foreign ships were carrying contraband of war, the Japanese side might apply a "right of first purchase." On September 5, the Japanese side further announced that it would expand the blockade area, extending from Qinhuangdao in the north to Beihai in the south. As a result, the entire coastline of China is de facto under blockade. At the same time, the Japanese naval authorities announced that the Japanese side reserves the right to inspect the nationality of all ships in Chinese territorial waters and requested that all foreign shipping companies notify the Japanese side of the movements of their ships in Chinese territorial waters. ㊂ Japanese Aircraft Bomb the Red Cross: Although Japan is a signatory to the 1929 Geneva Convention, its troops in China have brazenly violated the provisions of the Convention and have repeatedly ravaged the Red Cross, which is engaged in humanitarian work to rescue wounded soldiers. Dr. Yan Fuqing, head of the Chinese Red Cross, gave a statement to the press on August 29, stating that the Shanghai Red Cross had a total of 30 ambulances, of which 7 were destroyed by Japanese aircraft. The Red Cross emblem is very easy to recognize, but Japanese aircraft often deliberately pursue Red Cross vehicles and sometimes even throw bombs at them. On August 18, the Zhenru Red Cross Hospital was bombed by Japanese aircraft. Fortunately, the wounded soldiers had been transferred in advance. Only one stretcher bearer was killed and one doctor and three rescue personnel were injured. The next day, the Nanhsiang Red Cross rescue team was bombed by Japanese aircraft, killing two wounded soldiers and injuring four team members. The atrocities of the Japanese army in shooting Red Cross personnel in Luodian on August 23 were even more inhumane. At that time, 43 rescue team members were rescuing wounded soldiers when they were suddenly surrounded by the Japanese army, who tore off their Red Cross emblems from their white uniforms, forced them to kneel down, and shot them. One doctor and four nurses were killed on the spot. Only three nurses escaped in the meantime, and one of them was shot and injured by the Japanese army while escaping and died the next day. The whereabouts of the other team members are still unknown. The brutality of the Japanese army has made the work of the Red Cross extremely difficult. Currently, most of the staff's work behind the lines must be carried out at night to avoid danger. As for the Japanese claim that Red Cross ambulances were carrying ammunition, it is completely unfounded. The Chinese Red Cross is very cautious in the use of the Red Cross flag. All 30 ambulances have been specially authorized by the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession to pass through the concessions. Before they set off for the war zone, they were thoroughly inspected. Therefore, the Japanese side's deliberate bombing of Red Cross hospitals and ambulances cannot be concealed by any pretext. ㊃ Wanton Attacks on Non-Combatants: There are many cases of Japanese air force indiscriminately attacking non-combatants. Here are a few examples to show the brutality of the Japanese army. On August 17, about ten Japanese aircraft attacked Nantong, 80 miles from Shanghai, and dropped six bombs on the American Church Hospital, which hit the main building and caused a fire, killing two Chinese doctors and two nurses, and injuring many people, including two American nurses who were on duty. On August 28, twelve Japanese aircraft attacked Nanshi, Shanghai. Nanshi is a densely populated residential area for civilians and has no Chinese troops or positions. Japanese bombs landed densely near the South Railway Station, killing more than 200 innocent civilians and injuring 500 others. Most of the victims were refugees waiting for trains to leave Shanghai, especially women and children. On August 31, Japanese aircraft bombed the public bus station in Dachang Town, killing and injuring hundreds of people on the spot. On the same day, Cangzhou, about 70 miles south of Tianjin, also suffered the same tragedy. Hundreds of civilians were killed and injured by Japanese aircraft. On the morning of September 5, sixteen Japanese aircraft attacked the western side of the Shanghai Public Concession, and Beixinjing, which is not a war zone. Many houses were destroyed and many people were killed and injured. When Japanese aircraft were flying over the area, they saw two sailboats full of refugees in the Suzhou River, and they immediately bombed them. One was bombed, killing 40 people and injuring 60. The other was strafed by aircraft machine guns, also killing many. ㊄ Japanese Military Wantonly Destroys Cultural and Educational Institutions: Since the outbreak of the war, the Japanese military has paid special attention to Chinese educational and cultural institutions, selecting them as targets and wantonly destroying them. Nankai University and its affiliated middle school, which are well-known, were set on fire by the Japanese army. This was one of the earliest atrocities after they occupied Tianjin. Since then, schools at all levels, partially or completely destroyed by Japanese air force bombing, are too numerous to mention. Nantong Zhongying Girls' School, Nanchang Baoling Fang School, Agricultural College, and Rural Normal School, Nanjing Central University and its affiliated experimental school, Orphans' School, and Wusong Tongji University are the most prominent. It is especially noteworthy that all the schools attacked by the Japanese air force, with the exception of Tongji University, are far away from the war zone and have nothing to do with the war. Even Tongji University is not in the actual war zone, and there were no Chinese troops stationed inside when it was destroyed. The actions of the Japanese army in Chinese territory in the past few weeks, as described above, are sufficient to prove that Japan is determined to expand its aggressive actions throughout China, and its goal is to destroy China's political institutions and eliminate Chinese culture in order to realize its dream of conquering the continent. Even more, according to the facts mentioned above, it can be seen that the Japanese military, when invading Chinese territory, has absolutely disregarded all international public law, treaty provisions, and humanitarian creeds, ignoring legal and moral considerations, resorting to unchecked violent trampling, and indulging in the dream of conquest, relying on massacres and destruction. Not only is the life of our 450 million Chinese people in danger, but also the world's culture and security are precarious, and the future is unthinkable. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>⊙Hyde Park: President Roosevelt, in view of the growing domestic fear of war, announced today that he would shorten his vacation. He was originally scheduled to return to Washington on Wednesday morning, but now he has advanced it to Tuesday. At the same time, according to Washington news, due to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, domestic peace groups are advocating the implementation of neutrality laws, so whether or not a special session of Congress will be convened this fall cannot be decided. If Congress holds a special session, there will be many people in both the House and Senate who will demand the implementation of neutrality laws. (National Telegraph dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek's Radio Address to America</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] (Continued from yesterday) The Japanese warlords have already shown the world that they brazenly disregard their international credibility, shaming their former samurai in the afterlife and diminishing the noble spirit of Bushido. Yet, after the world has witnessed their ugly deeds, they shamelessly remain unashamed. The real reason for this is their confidence that no world power dares to oppose them. There is no doubt about it. Therefore, the Japanese warlords are striving to carry out their conquest plan, confident that they can destroy China and, in time, exclude Western culture and commercial power. If we Chinese do not stop them, they will conquer China and establish a Japanese empire on the mainland to disrupt the world. Since they have already destroyed international morality, their mainland empire will be based purely on force. At the very least, Japan intends to dominate the Eastern countries in order to further manipulate international actions and policies. Since Japan harbors such ambition, it is not surprising that they openly question why China dares to resist. Premier Konoe's accusations are also inevitable. In the past, when China succumbed meekly, all countries were surprised why China did not resist. Today, the situation is exactly the opposite. China has begun to resist, fighting for sovereignty, for survival, and for the dignity of treaties, yet other countries sit idly by while their rights and interests in China are being destroyed by Japan, and their expatriates in China are forced to relocate and become refugees. Is this not a strange thing? This passive acceptance by other countries is what the Japanese military is most pleased to see, for they believe that the prestige of Europe and the United States in the Far East has been effortlessly swept away by the Japanese. Therefore, we are bewildered and feel that this is a sign of cultural collapse. Do you not see the Japanese planes dropping bombs all over the place? The enemy ships on the Yangtze River stretch for dozens of miles, with countless cannons and machine guns. The Chinese people are being slaughtered miserably. Do you not see homes and markets destroyed by arson or reduced to ashes by bombing? Do you not see blood flowing in the fields and corpses piled up like hills? Do you not see thousands upon thousands of Chinese and foreign refugees screaming in terror, hoping to save their lives? Woe to my Chinese people, millions of women and children, who have seen their homes destroyed and have nothing to wear and nothing to eat, and have become homeless and helpless. And when they try to leave Shanghai to escape this catastrophe, the tragedy becomes even more horrific. Just a few days ago, thousands of refugees gathered at the South Station in Shanghai, waiting for trains to leave, when Japanese planes appeared overhead and dropped bombs at will, scattering the flesh and blood of three hundred innocent people, with over four hundred injured. There were no soldiers near the station. There is absolutely no reason for such a massacre. The Shanghai-based British newspaper, the "North-China Daily News," described this barbaric act as "a crime of wantonly killing human beings, whose cruelty could not be more extreme." A few days later, when many refugees were taking trains to leave Shanghai at Songjiang Station, a few miles from Shanghai, they were attacked again in the same way, resulting in another three hundred people being shattered to pieces and killed, and hundreds more seriously injured. Again, there was not a single soldier on the train. The "China Press", an American newspaper published in the Far East, said in its editorial that the first incident was "deliberate murder," and when the second atrocity occurred, it said directly that "no word in the dictionary can adequately describe such a heinous act." Furthermore, in Changshu, not far from Shanghai and with no troops, on August 23, Japanese bombers suddenly flew in and first strafed the people with machine guns on one side of its prosperous streets, and then bombed homes and shops, before flying to the other side to do the same, until hundreds were dead and the whole city was a ruin. Such massacres are now taking place throughout our country. In the future, when they build airfields on the islands they have seized or on the Japanese suburban golf courses in Shanghai, the extent of the massacres will become even more severe. I now dare to ask the Western countries, is sitting idly by and saying nothing while watching such massacres and destruction to be regarded as advocating humanity, paying attention to morality, respecting chivalry, and believing in the triumph of Christian civilization? And I also ask whether the great powers are standing by with their hands in their pockets, as if frightened by Japan's violence, so that they dare not say a word of criticism. Is this not to be regarded as the prelude to the decline of international morality, Christian creeds, or so-called Western virtues? If the Western countries are indifferent to the above and abandon the treaties lightly, then we Chinese, who have always been known as cowardly and have been working hard for years, will have to resist to the end as far as our strength allows. We will fight until we achieve final victory, or fight until final defeat. Even if our beautiful land and long history are stained with blood and destroyed, we will not hesitate. Gentlemen, you can hear the sound of artillery fire on the radio, but you can only imagine the groans of the dying, the pain of the wounded, and the sound of collapsing houses. The suffering and hunger of the majority of innocent, homeless, and displaced people, the cries of mothers mourning their beloved sons, and the black smoke and flames of burning houses are often beyond your comprehension. I will stop here. Goodbye, gentlemen. (Central News Agency telegram, 12th)</p>

<h3>War Clouds Over Europe</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, everyone's attention has been focused on the development of the war situation, and little attention has been paid to international political situations outside the Far East. This is a natural phenomenon and nothing to be surprised about. However, modern international relations are very close, so we should also pay considerable attention to the recent developments in Europe.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in the Far East, an important development in Europe is that the fascist countries of Germany and Italy have taken the opportunity to further challenge the God of Peace, expanding their influence and remotely supporting their fascist comrades in the Far East. This challenge is mainly manifested in the following two aspects.</p>
<p>First, Germany and Italy are more openly interfering in the Spanish Civil War. Germany and Italy's help to the Franco rebels and interference in the Spanish Civil War was an open secret, but it has become more obvious recently. When the Italian Blackshirts captured the city of Santander, Franco even telegraphed Mussolini to express his gratitude and congratulations. And the Blackshirt Prime Minister openly admitted and wished the rebels victory in the future. Such open interference was rare in the past.</p>
<p>Second, mysterious submarines have repeatedly appeared in the Mediterranean, attacking merchant ships and warships of various countries. As many as two Soviet merchant ships have been sunk, and countless others have been attacked without being damaged. This piracy is obviously done by a country in the Mediterranean, so the Soviet Union directly protested to Italy twice after the incident, and Britain, France, and other countries also severely condemned this piracy.</p>
<p>The fascist countries' actions of challenge are naturally intolerable to peace-loving countries. Therefore, after the fall of Santander, France advocated convening an international intervention committee to protest to Italy. However, later, seeing that this action failed to produce practical results and the situation in the Mediterranean was very tense, it united with Britain to invite twelve countries, including the Soviet Union, Turkey, Italy, and Germany, to a meeting in Nyon to discuss ways to sanction piracy in the Mediterranean and ensure the safety of merchant ships of various countries. However, Italy, which is fundamentally a highly suspected country, naturally did not want to participate in this meeting that was unfavorable to it, so it refused on the pretext. Germany also took consistent action with Italy and refused to participate. However, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and other countries not only did not cancel the meeting because of Germany and Italy's refusal but also quickly negotiated three specific measures to prevent the recurrence of piracy and protect the safety of merchant ships of various countries. The firm attitude adopted by Britain, France, and other countries at the Nyon Conference is naturally a major blow to countries challenging fascism.</p>
<p>It is not yet known whether fascist countries will respect the decisions of the Nyon Conference and no longer engage in piracy. If Germany and Italy do not currently have the resolve to immediately provoke a European war, they will probably not dare to act as barbarously as in the past. But do Germany and Italy now have no intention of igniting the fuse of war? This question is too important to determine. However, judging from their actions of challenge, they have long been marching towards this volcano. Germany and Italy formed a fascist axis last year. Recently, the Blackshirt Prime Minister plans to visit Germany on the 25th to meet with Hitler. This meeting of the two giants will definitely not produce anything good.</p>
<p>The fascist challenge in Europe is both to expand their own power and to respond to the Far East killer's attack on China. Because the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact has already been established, and the Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact will soon be signed. This international fascist alliance will be a great blow to world peace. Therefore, peace-loving countries in the world should unite immediately and form a solid collective security system to sanction this international group that is destroying peace.</p>
<h3>German Leader Reiterates Demand for Return of Former Colonies</h3>
<p>Says that if this issue is not resolved, the European situation will be difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>[Berlin] German leader Hitler held a frank discussion with news reporters today on domestic and international issues, acknowledging that Germany is at risk of a food shortage and stating that unless the issue of the disposition of colonies can be resolved, the European situation will be difficult to stabilize. Hitler did not specify which territories Germany wishes to reclaim but firmly asserted that Germany has a moral right to reclaim its confiscated territories. Hitler also solemnly declared that Germany has no plans for war preparations and urged all countries to treat their domestic minorities well. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>[Paris] According to a French reporter, German leader Hitler made several important statements yesterday during an informal talk with foreign reporters in Nuremberg. When Havas News raised the issue of colonies, Hitler stated that he firmly believed this issue would be resolved automatically in the future, just as the issue of equal rights had been resolved automatically in the past. However, Hitler claimed, "This is a matter of reason, and I firmly believe that reason will eventually prevail. At the same time, this is a matter of our honor, because the German people do not want to immigrate to other countries, only ask for the return of their original colonies, not to seize them from other countries." Then a British reporter asked, "Will Germany establish naval bases in the colonies?" Hitler replied, "A strong fleet is necessary to have naval bases. Before the war, Germany's expansion of colonies was entirely for economic reasons, and military considerations were not taken into account. Now, if you want to protect distant colonies with an army, it is not only futile but also impossible." (Haitong Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>⊙ Nuremberg German leader Hitler recently met with German and foreign reporters in the Grand Hall of the ancient castle in this city. The leader wore a brown shirt, shook hands with each reporter in a very sincere manner, and made a speech, the main point of which was that "a way must eventually be found to resolve the issue of colonies, just as the issue of equal rights in armaments was eventually resolved. In short, unless the issue of colonies is resolved, there can be no real peace in Europe." The leader also told the reporters that he had given eleven speeches in eight days, and several times spoke in front of more than 100,000 people, and felt very tired. "Once the National Socialist Party Congress is over, I will go to Munich and Berchtesgaden to rest for a while, and then return to Berlin."</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister's Visit to Germany's Intentions</p>
<p>Someone asked what the meaning of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's visit to Germany was, whether it was only to reaffirm the strength of the Berlin-Rome political axis or whether it had a more important purpose. The leader replied, "The meaning of the Italian Prime Minister's visit is quite obvious, and there is no need to say more. All countries are suspicious of our intentions, but we are now very quiet and doing nothing. We do not want to seize anything that belongs to anyone, nor do we want to dominate any foreign nation. That is all there is to our racism. Understanding this will dispel all doubts."</p>
<p>Restoration of Equality in Armaments</p>
<p>"Since the end of the European War until 1933, Germany was nothing more than a gap in Europe for fourteen years, but this situation no longer exists under the rule of the National Socialist Party. We have already restored the right to equality in armaments and have filled the gap properly. The factor of insecurity in Europe has thus been eliminated, and we can now devote ourselves to various major responsibilities."</p>
<p>Concern about Food Shortage</p>
<p>"These responsibilities are very heavy, and the food problem is especially important. The food produced in Germany is not enough to meet the needs of the people. The amount lacking is 10% to 12%. In other words, 7 million people in Germany lack food. If this problem is to be solved satisfactorily, Germany must obtain colonies. We must know that this is not a question of peace or war, but only a question of reason. I firmly believe that reason will eventually prevail."</p>
<p>Colonies Seek</p>
<p>At this point, a reporter from a British newspaper asked whether Germany would use the colonies as naval bases after acquiring them. Hitler smiled and replied, "If we want to implement this, we must first have a sufficient navy. Before the European War, Germany's development of colonies was only for the purpose of developing commerce, and there was no military intention. It is not a wise plan to raise troops to defend distant colonies." Another reporter asked why Germany did not start from the commercial aspect to solve the colonial problem. The leader replied, "In terms of commerce, if all countries buy as much goods from Germany as possible, Germany will also buy as much goods from those countries as possible in return, but the colonial problem is not only a commercial problem, but also related to Germany's honor. Our people now do not want to leave their country and live with foreigners, and they do not only want to do business, but want to be protected by the flag of their country. Britain, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, and Japan all have colonies, why can't we? We are not asking for land from any country. What we are seeking is only to reclaim our country's past colonies."</p>
<p>Minority Issues</p>
<p>When talking about the issue of minorities in other countries, he said that Germany has no imperialistic ambitions. "We only hope that the authorities in other countries will treat the German minorities in their countries fairly, as the Yugoslavian government has done. The 700,000 to 800,000 German minorities in that country are currently satisfied with their situation, which is clear evidence."</p>
<p>Devote to Construction Undertakings</p>
<p>Finally, the leader talked about the public works plans implemented by the German government in the country, such as building automobile roads and holding international expositions in Munich in 1945 and in Berlin in 1950, and said, "If other countries also have such great plans and work hard for ten to twenty years as we do, then the world can be at peace."

<h3>Nyon Agreement Takes Effect Today</h3>
<p>British and French Policy Victory, European Situation Turns to Moderation</p>
<p>[Geneva] Following the conclusion of the Nyon Nine-Power Agreement on Saturday, Britain will be responsible for dispatching thirty-five destroyers, and France will dispatch twenty-five, to jointly patrol the Mediterranean Sea to ensure the safety of navigation. In the vicinity of the naval bases of Malta and Gibraltar, in addition to destroyers, aircraft will also assist in patrolling. British and French naval experts believe that the mere signing of the Nyon Agreement is sufficient to deter pirate actions. Therefore, although the agreement will take effect tomorrow, it may not be necessary to use force. At the same time, Italy and Germany are pleased that the Soviet Union has not joined the Mediterranean patrol. Currently, German and Italian newspapers hold the attitude that the Soviet Union is responsible for condoning piracy. According to Rome sources, Italy does not want to abide by any Mediterranean solution unless it places Italy on an equal footing with other countries. Italy may not make a decision on participating in the Nyon Agreement until the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish situation convenes. According to Nuremberg sources, German circles express resentment at the speeches delivered by Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov in Nyon, and some even suggest that Germany should no longer sit at the same table with Litvinov. However, the Soviet Communist Party's organ, Pravda, greatly praises Litvinov, saying that Italian pirates hide behind a "nationality unknown" smokescreen, but this mask has now been unveiled by Litvinov. The Soviet Union is willing to fully support the Nyon Conference's proposal to safeguard the safety of navigation in the Mediterranean. If Italian pirates damage Soviet ships and kill its people, the Soviet Union will adopt its own plan. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] This morning, British newspapers all welcomed the Mediterranean plan, considering it a practical way to deal with the submarine threat. The Times stated that the Nyon Conference concluded an agreement with extremely swift means, and the plan it adopted has a pragmatic nature, so those who criticize the Nyon Conference are silent. British and French naval advisors have established a method that allows neutral ships traveling on the two major sea routes in the Mediterranean to avoid submarine atrocities. The efforts shown by the British representatives in Nyon, and the British government's readiness to assist the weak countries in the Mediterranean, are all commendable. The Daily Telegraph reported that no government can object to the naval measures stipulated in the Nyon Agreement. Italy and Germany have both declared their sympathy for the Nyon Conference's objectives. Today's smiling welcome of the resolution has proven that they have absolutely no bias in the Spanish Civil War. People expect that Italian and German sympathy can eventually become tangible assistance. (Central News Agency, 13th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Rumor of Japan and Italy Concluding Anti-Comintern Pact</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Recently, some in Japan have advocated strengthening the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact. At the same time, the future of Japan-Italy relations is attracting attention. This morning, the "Nichinichi Shimbun" reported that when Horita, the new ambassador to Italy, took office in June, Hirota instructed him to begin preliminary negotiations on concluding an Anti-Comintern Pact. After Horita's arrival, he met with Mussolini once and had several talks with Ciano. It has been clarified that Italy is willing to accept Japan's consultation. Therefore, it is still in progress. The content of the agreement is generally the same as the Japan-Germany agreement. However, due to the complex and delicate European political situation, when to start formal negotiations is still under consideration. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this statement is unfounded and may be a misinterpretation of the Japan-Italy trade treaty negotiations.

<h3>Returning from the Front Lines</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>The scorched earth of Zhabei is like a painted skull, while the meritorious brigade commander is concerned about the international situation.</p>
<p>In peacetime, going to Zhabei from the concessions was easy, like entering an inner room from an outer courtyard, truly "easy as pie." However, during this time of constant artillery fire, it is as difficult as ascending to heaven. But the difficulty is not like the ruggedness of the roads of Shu, but rather that the two areas are closely connected, with only a narrow path to pass through. Without a familiar guide, it would be impossible to find the way. It happened that the night before, at the home of my friend Mr. Luo Yiwen, I met Mr. Wang Boxiong, director of a certain department, who kindly guided me to complete my inspection of Zhabei.</p>
<p>Just as we were about to depart from a certain place, heroic and admirable Boy Scouts suddenly captured a suspected traitor who was holding a large bundle of "ruble" banknotes and looking around in the street. After inspection, it was proven that he was a straggler from a certain division's party student team. He had picked up the rubles in the Jiang area. Fortunately, they were not the enemy's gold yuan notes. He had an older brother who was a martyr in the January 28th Resistance. This time, he joined the army on a distant expedition, hoping to avenge his brother! The final decision was to have him accompany the wounded soldiers on the medical transport vehicle to the front lines. He was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. He said he would ask his superiors to change his duties and let him rush to the enemy lines to recoup his losses! During roll call, someone casually asked, "Where did that traitor go?" Unexpectedly, an electric-like protest came from the car compartment: "Here—here! But that bastard is the real traitor!" This remark provoked a burst of laughter, and our car gently started moving forward.</p>
<p>Most of the battlefields we passed through on the way to the front lines were desolate countryside, occasionally small towns or isolated villages, which made one feel the ease of artillery fire and the undercurrent of flames. Zhabei, on the other hand, used to be a prosperous city with tall Western-style buildings, smooth roads, thriving commerce and industry, and a dense population. According to common sense, even if she had unfortunately been seized by the devil's claws of war, she had not been ravaged for long, and her endowments were so good that her appearance should not have changed much. But in reality, unfortunately, Zhabei had suffered from the enemy's brutal and crazy artillery fire. Not only had her appearance changed, but she had simply become a painted skull sacrificed to the great era!</p>
<p>In this painted skull-like Zhabei at night, the first deep impression is the eerie and terrifying darkness. The lights on the car are not allowed to be turned on, and even flashlights are not allowed to emit light. I wish I hadn't brought one, as it would be easier. Sometimes, a floating flare suddenly bursts out in the sky, illuminating our positions, and you have to get out of the car and hide, holding your breath and listening to the buzzing of enemy planes. After three or four minutes, the eerie darkness returns as usual. As you walk, you encounter tangled electric wires and crumbling walls blocking the way. There are also newly burned houses with lingering embers and acrid smoke, making it impossible to cover your nose and pass through. Naturally, in such a large area, there are also many alleys and buildings that have miraculously survived unscathed. However, there is no sound of chickens or dogs, and no sign of people (sentries are also not easy to find). The silence and stillness are like walking alone in a deep mountain or wilderness at midnight. The sound of gunfire from the melee street battles in the □□□ area reaches us in bursts, like soybeans being fried in a hot pot, exploding louder and louder. Analyzing it, the scattered sound of hand-launched grenades mostly comes from our soldiers charging into enemy fortifications. The "ta-dong, ta-dong" sound of Type 38 rifles is surely from Japanese pirates who are holding fast to their strongholds and firing rapidly from dangerous positions. This tense and eerie atmosphere of street fighting is clearly different from the ease of artillery fire and dim flames of field battles.</p>
<p>In a house at the end of a deep alley, I met a battalion commander of the Zhengke Patriotic Girls' School who led by example. He has been promoted to the deputy director of a certain brigade headquarters. It is said that whether the Patriotic Girls' School is captured or not is extremely important to the outcome of the battle in the Jiangwan area. Although the officers and soldiers of that battalion made great contributions to capturing it, only seven of them were not "wounded" after the fierce battle. More than fifty were lightly or seriously wounded, and more than sixty were killed in action, showing the extent of the sacrifice. Now the enemy's ambition is not dead, and they often counterattack. The night before, our army captured an armored vehicle, which was being towed to the rear by truck tonight. Unfortunately, we didn't get a close look when we met it on the road in the dark.</p>
<p>After consulting by telephone and obtaining the consent of Brigadier General Liao □□ of a certain brigade, Director Wang Boxiong and Wang Zhenjia led the way, wearing steel helmets and holding pistols, and groped forward for another twenty miles to inspect the positions in the □□□ area. The car encountered danger twice, and the driver accidentally touched the lever, causing him to bleed. After abandoning the car and walking, we met soldiers from a certain regiment who had just been relieved from the front lines. When they saw us wearing casual clothes, they kept calling out "Eh? Eh? Eh?" in surprise. As for their fatigue from the bloody battles, they seemed to "not care at all." This spirit of composure and perseverance is truly worthy of twelve thousand points of admiration!</p>
<p>Brigadier General Liao is tall and dignified. Since the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, we have continuously rejoiced in reading the battle reports of capturing important positions such as Chizhi University, Patriotic Girls' School, and Guangdong East Middle School, all thanks to his planning and command on the battlefield! Mr. Liao is only about thirty years old. He graduated from the Wuchang Normal University and then entered the fourth class of the Whampoa Military Academy. Since taking command, he has been known for his courage and skill in battle. It is said that he is the only graduate of the fourth class who has been promoted to brigadier general.</p>
<p>I had thought that this battlefield meeting would be a chance for him to talk freely about the war and express his feelings so that reporters could report to readers. Who knew that when I asked questions, he said very politely, "This all-out war of resistance is a difficult and great undertaking. As soldiers, we can only obey orders, bury ourselves in hard work, and strive to fulfill our natural duties in order to overcome the difficulties. Talking more is not helpful to the facts. However, I welcome your risking your life to come here because I want to ask you about the recent international sympathy for our country that has been invaded!"</p>
<p>These frank and sincere words show even more that Mr. Liao has a solid foundation in learning and a great mind. With such a general on the front lines, there is truly endless hope for victory in the war. Although he did not make an official statement, I believe that his attitude is more inspiring to us spiritually than making a statement!</p>

They personally purchased national salvation bonds. Even young children can be so enthusiastic about loving their country. It is hoped that compatriots across the country will enthusiastically contribute.</p>
<h3>National Youth Association Serves Troops in North China</h3>
<p>Gongren Society Service Group Provides Long-Term Service on the Front Lines</p>
<p>The Military Service Department of the National Youth Association, in order to serve the troops fighting on the front lines in North China, has already established a wounded soldiers' club, an officers' club, and a soldiers' club in Baoding. All tasks have been planned and are very suitable for the needs of the local troops. In Shijiazhuang, the Youth Association has also established a service branch to provide special services for military personnel. Many soldiers and officers visit the department every day, recognizing the Youth Association as their second home.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Gongren Society Youth Service Group has been working very hard, especially in rescue work. They hear daily about going to the front lines to rescue wounded soldiers and have achieved great results, which is highly praised by officers and soldiers of our army. Currently, there is a great shortage of rescue personnel on the front lines. The ×× Division of our army specially sent medical officer Li ×× to the group, requesting them to go to ×× and station there for a long time to provide rescue services. The group immediately sent personnel, and the first team set off by car to work on the front lines last night.</p>
<h3>Schools in the Public Concession Resume Classes One After Another</h3>
<p>Qinghua Primary and Secondary School</p>
<p>Qinghua Primary and Secondary School and Kindergarten on Baker Road have now resumed classes. Despite the rumbling of artillery fire, the number of applicants increases daily. Other schools, such as Chengzhong Primary and Secondary School, Chongshi Primary and Secondary School, and the affiliated secondary school of Shanghai University, have all negotiated borrowing arrangements. The night school of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is cooperating with the Shuhua Vocational Night School affiliated with Qinghua. Thus, the singing of learning continues without interruption, cultivating talents for the country. There is much to commend. All levels of primary, secondary, and kindergarten schools continue to enroll new male and female students and offer four installments for tuition payment. Typing and traditional Chinese painting courses are available for enrollment at any time, with low fees to encourage education.</p>
<h3>Zhencui Primary School</h3>
<p>Zhencui Primary School, located at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Hart Road in this city, reopened on September 10. Almost all of the old and new students attended. The school is scheduled to resume classes tomorrow, the 15th, and will continue to accept transfer students to facilitate students from the war zone.</p>
<h3>Amidst Vegetable Panic, Large Quantities of Salted Fish Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in this city, transportation has been hindered, and vegetables from various places cannot be transported to Shanghai, directly affecting the lives of residents. The Shanghai Salted Fish Industry Association, recognizing the increasing cost of living for ordinary people, specially instructed its member Yuanchang Fish Company to directly order 300 boxes of small Qingchuan salted fish (approximately 400 catties per box) from the British company Case &amp; Co. in Canada for long term benefit. They have now been shipped to Shanghai and will be distributed to fish vendors in order to lower market prices.</p>
<h3>YWCA Introduces Refugee Women and Children to Work</h3>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident, the Shanghai YWCA began to take in refugee women and children. A few days ago, the YWCA again took in a large number of homeless women and children who had fled from Yangshupu. It is reported that the YWCA is finding it difficult to continue taking in more people due to the large number of people it has already taken in. The YWCA has found ways to introduce some of the refugees to suitable jobs. It is now publicly seeking employers for the remaining majority of refugees.</p>
<h3>Chinese Manager of Japanese Bank Resigns</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, the whole country united to resist Japan. According to reliable information from the Foreign Banks Association, the Chinese managers and all staff and servants of various Japanese commercial banks have resigned because they are unwilling to cooperate with the Japanese side. They have all resigned since the outbreak of the war. From now on, the Japanese side will lose their assistance, and matters in the banks will become even more disorganized. This is also a good sign of our country's resistance against Japan.</p>

<h3>Enemy Attacks Repeatedly Fail, We Firmly Defend New Defense Line and Respond Calmly</h3>
<p>This morning, our side concentrated artillery fire on North Sichuan Road. Our troops on Huangxing Road bravely resisted, and the enemy suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>In order to escape the threat of enemy naval artillery fire and avoid unnecessary sacrifices, our army withdrew its positions in the city center and Yinxiang Township yesterday morning (13th) and retreated to the first line of defense. The troops of our army that withdrew from the city center area guarded the line from Gaojingmiao to the Wanguo Sports Association, east of Songhu Road. Enemy troops invaded the line from Lujiajiao (west of the city stadium) to Sijingqiu Field (near Yangjiazai on Yingao Road). Since midnight yesterday, they have attacked our positions several times. Our army responded calmly, waiting for the enemy to approach before unleashing dense machine gun fire and attacking with hand grenades. As of noon today, the enemy has not succeeded. As for the troops of our army that withdrew from the Yinxiang Township area, they are guarding the line of Huangxing Road, with the right flank still based on the northern line of the concession, with no changes. The enemy in the eastern part of Yinxiang Township attacked our Huangxing Road line last night. Our army braved the rain to meet them, and the sound of rifles and machine guns never stopped all night until dawn this morning. The enemy suffered heavy losses and retreated.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Advance to Sijingqiu Field</h3>
<p>Fierce fighting took place there last night. Our army is still stationed on Huangxing Road.</p>

<p>At around 8:00 AM this morning, the enemy in the Sijingqiu Field area launched a fierce attack on our army's positions at Songhu Road and Jiangwan Racecourse. Our army's defenses there are solid, and the enemy suffered significant losses after being severely attacked by us. There was also artillery fire near the Zhabei Water Tower. Our army at Qingyun Road Baziqiao fiercely shelled the North Sichuan Road area at around 6:00 AM this morning. At the same time, the sound of machine guns was as dense as a string of beads. The enemy suffered heavy losses near the Japanese naval landing force headquarters and the Japanese elementary school.</p>
<h3>We Resolutely Resist on Huangxing Road</h3>
<p>Enemy warships shelled the Huangpu River this morning. The enemy's infantry attack ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Although the enemy has invaded Yinxiang Township and the city center, our army in Yinxiang Township is still retreating to the area west of Ningguo Road and Huangxing Road. There was fierce rifle and machine gun fighting there from around 6:00 PM last night to dawn this morning. This morning, enemy warships occasionally opened fire in the Huangpu River, aiming at our army's positions there in order to assist their infantry's attack. However, our army resisted resolutely, vowing not to retreat. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and ultimately failed to succeed.</p>
<h3>Busy Troop Movements by Enemy in Hongkou</h3>
<p>According to people coming from Yangshupu, starting at 6:00 AM this morning, Japanese military transport trucks in the Yangshupu and Hongkou districts were fully loaded with armed Japanese soldiers and supplies, rushing back and forth, heading to Hongkou Park and Xiangxiang and other places. This kind of busy state had not been seen in a month. It seems that the enemy is reorganizing its military deployment in that area.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Attack Our Pudong Positions</h3>
<p>Frequently Bombarding Us with Cannons This Morning, a Small Enemy Squad Attempting to Land Was Repelled</p>
<p>After the front lines of our army in Baoshan, Yanghang, and Yuepu were broken through by enemy troops, the situation in Pudong also became tense. Enemy troops have been patrolling the surface of the Huangpu River in armed motorboats for days, spying on our military situation and attempting to land, changing from passive to active. This morning, enemy troops resumed bombarding our army's Chen land in Pudong with cannons. At the same time, a small squad of enemy troops attempted to land and was immediately repelled by our army.</p>
<h3>Another Enemy Transport Ship Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After Loading the Bodies, It Will Sail Back to Japan Tonight</p>
<p>At dawn this morning, an enemy transport ship arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Mitsubishi Wharf on Huangpu Road, unloading a large number of burlap bags and defensive materials.

Several of them are unloading huge quantities of military supplies at the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu. Most of the naval landing forces carried by the remaining ships have also landed and gradually sailed out until dawn this morning.</p>
<h3>Enemy Bombs and Destroys Alcohol Factory in Pudong</h3>
<p>Disregarding Foreign Property, Enemy Planes Harass Nanshi Again This Morning</p>
<p>From 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, enemy planes gathered in small squadrons three times and flew to Bailianjing in Pudong to bomb the alcohol factory, dropping a total of thirteen bombs, most of which landed in the fields. Although the alcohol factory was slightly damaged, many nearby civilian houses were destroyed. After crossing the river to investigate this morning, there were more than twenty people injured and five dead on the spot, all of whom were villagers in the neighborhood. It was found that the alcohol factory had long been shut down and that a British flag was hanging on its roof. At the same time, there was the American Dale Shipping Company and the British Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory nearby. Most of the factories in that area are the property of foreigners, and the Japanese planes' disregard for international law in bombing them is evidence of their arrogance. In addition, the Dongjiadu area of Nanshi was also bombed yesterday, but the bombs did not explode. At around 9:00 AM this morning, another enemy plane flew low over Nanshi along the Rihui Port area for reconnaissance and occasionally strafed with intermittent machine gun fire before flying to Pudong.</p>
<h3>Enemy Motorboat Sinks in Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Five of Seven Enemy Soldiers Drown</p>
<p>Last night (13th), a small enemy motorboat responsible for transmitting information sailed into the Huangpu River and transmitted some kind of important information to the enemy warships in the river. The motorboat then hurriedly sailed out of the Huangpu River, but it is believed that because the boat was traveling too fast and because it was night, the boat mistakenly collided with buoy number thirty-eight, causing the boat to sink. Seven enemy soldiers were on board. Two of the enemy soldiers were rescued, and five enemy soldiers drowned. Today, another enemy warship is using machines to try to salvage the motorboat.</p>
<h3>Enemy Gunboats Bomb Humen This Morning, Two Shot Down by Our Planes</h3>

The planes returned safely at 6:30 AM. It is confirmed that two enemy ships were shot down. At the same time, part of the Pearl River has been blocked by the Chinese authorities. The authorities have sunk two civilian ships and an old ship full of cement in a shallow area of the second beach, about six miles downstream of Huangpu. Only a narrow channel is left open for ships to pass through. This morning after the battle, Chen Ce, the commander of Humen Fortress, telegraphed Guangzhou and said that the Japanese ships participating in the shelling included one cruiser and four destroyers. According to the reports of Chinese planes, the shells fired from Humen Fortress hit twice. As for the damage suffered by Humen, it was very minor and not worth mentioning.

<h3>French Woman Writes to This Newspaper, Bitterly Describing the Enemy Planes' Atrocities</h3>
<p>French Woman Personally Experiences Great Suffering, Expresses Gratitude to Chinese People for Escorting Her to Safety</p>
<p>Madam A. Jcurdant, a French national residing at No. 139 Huanlong Road, French Concession, Shanghai, encountered a Japanese aircraft bombing on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train while returning to Shanghai from Mogan Mountain. She was escorted to safety by Chinese people along the way and expressed her deep gratitude. She sent a special letter to this newspaper, saying, "I went down the mountain from Mogan Mountain, where I was escaping the summer heat, on the 22nd of last month. I took the train from Hangzhou back to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, at around 9 pm, when the train passed a certain village, two Japanese aircraft suddenly appeared in the sky and dropped two bombs, one in front of the train and one behind it. The railway tracks in front and behind were destroyed, and the train could not move forward. The train staff immediately informed us that there was no other way but to walk to Songjiang. At this time, the only foreigners who encountered this difficulty were myself and an American lady. I am physically weak and often ill, and it was already difficult for me to crawl alone, let alone carry the clothing I had with me. Just when I was in a state of great difficulty, two Chinese people happened to be nearby and took pity on my weakness. They generously each carried one of my clothing bags and escorted me on foot late at night, walking all night until 8 am the next morning, when we finally arrived in Songjiang. One of these Chinese people also took the train from Songjiang to Shanghai with me. I am eternally grateful. I think that the Japanese planes arbitrarily bomb civilians, non-combatants, and non-battlefields without any restraint, truly disregarding justice and lacking humanity. Recalling these two Chinese people who helped me through the difficult situation, the difference is like heaven and earth. Therefore, I am writing a few words and asking your newspaper to publish them in the newspaper to express my gratitude for the kindness of these two Chinese people. Furthermore, when I parted with these two gentlemen, I gave them my address in Shanghai in detail, and I hope that these two gentlemen will visit my humble residence so that I can thank them in person."</p>
<h3>World League of Nations Association Makes Final Appeal to Japan</h3>

<h3>Lingyan Mountain Monks Help Save the Nation and Donate</h3>
<p>Master Yinguang is a true monk who combines words and deeds and practices diligently. In recent years, he has secluded himself in Baoguo Temple. His disciples and monks from Lingyan Temple, nearly a hundred people in total, all regard the Dharma master's morality as their guide, living a simple and ascetic life without any savings. Many people in Suzhou are well aware of this. Now that the war in Shanghai has broken out, not only is there an urgent need for military supplies, but also for funds to rescue the wounded soldiers and refugees. Master Yinguang voluntarily donated 600 yuan, Lingyan Temple donated 210 yuan, Master Desen donated 30 yuan, and Master Miaozhen Liaoran Hengzhi and others each donated 10 yuan. All the monastics and laypeople in the two temples did their best to contribute, raising a total of 1,013.8 yuan in national currency, which was transferred to the Wu County Anti-Enemy Support Association by layman Cao Songqiao. It was specified that this amount be used for three equally divided purposes: saving the nation, comforting the wounded soldiers, and rescuing the refugees, to fulfill the duties of citizens. Furthermore, Lingyan Temple has set up a shelter at its lower temple at the foot of the mountain at the end of Mudu Street to accommodate homeless refugees, with expenses generally covered by the temple monks. The monks of the two temples are so simple, yet they are so spontaneously patriotic. It is hoped that other temples and nunneries will also be inspired and invigorated.</p>

On the 13th, it issued a general order to all its subordinates to learn from their example.</p>
<h3>Trivial Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>I said yesterday that this Sino-Japanese war should be calculated entirely, not partially, and calculated finally, not temporarily. Therefore, the final reckoning is difficult to predict, and I don't know what year or month it will be. By extension, taking Shanghai as a small part and counting from the past month, the results are also quite gratifying. Japan was originally a demon king who instigated world wars. How arrogant and boastful it was. However, with an army of 100,000 men, fighting fiercely for more than a month, and increasing its troops three times, its losses are extremely heavy, which can be confirmed. According to general statistics, the monthly expenditure must be 50 million yuan, and the losses in property and business in Shanghai are not counted, nor are the losses of soldiers, nor are the planes and warships destroyed by our army. And the result is still outside my first line of defense. This is too wasteful.</p>

<h3>Painful Memories (3)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shu Di</p>
<p>㊂ The Mystery of the Victory News on the 28th</p>
<p>The whole truth has now been fully revealed and placed before everyone. Without a doubt, all the victory news on July 28th was completely inaccurate. However, the two things that most arouse everyone's "mysterious feeling" are: First, is it possible that all the victory news, not even a trace of it exists? Third, where did these inaccurate news come from? And what for?</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, I think, as long as we briefly describe the real battle situation of that day, it will be completely answered.</p>
<p>On the 27th, the "peace" negotiations between the Hebei-Chahar authorities and the Japanese side declared their final failure. On the same day, Lai Zheyuan issued his final statement, stating: "My efforts for peace have been seen by all, but the efforts have failed. All future major plans should be presided over by the central government. I only ask all residents to remain calm and face the national crisis together," and so on. On the same night, the battles on the Tianjin-Pukou, Pinghan, and between Peiping and Tongzhou broke out simultaneously. All three routes were our side's offensive, and the points of contention were the Wanping and Lugouqiao areas on the Pinghan Line, the Fengtai and Langfang areas on the Tianjin-Pukou Line, and Tongxian, the old nest of the Ji Dong pseudo-organization between Peiping and Tongzhou. Needless to say, such an offensive strategy was carried out in accordance with the central government's instructions to take the opportunity to resolve the enemy's North China Garrison Army nearby. However, the pity is that the time was already more than two weeks late! The enemy's strength two weeks ago was already many times greater than it is now. Therefore, in addition to dealing with our attacks separately, the enemy also gathered troops and launched a fierce attack on the outskirts of Peiping in three routes: one route in the south, facing the Nanyuan area, one route in the west, the western suburbs, and one route in the north, the Shahe area. On that day, within a circular area of less than one hundred miles in diameter, battles broke out simultaneously in almost ten places. This time, the strategies used by both sides were very fierce: if our army wins on all routes, then the enemy's position in the Peiping-Tianjin area may be forced all the way to outside the pass: conversely, if the enemy wins, and Peiping is immediately lost, then our position in North China will have to be divided into three routes, and retreat separately in the directions of Ping Sui, Ping Han, and Tianjin-Pukou. On this day, we were fighting on the Ping Han Line with the 37th Division under Feng Zhi'an, on the Tianjin-Pukou Line with the 53rd Army under Wan Fulin, plus a part of Feng Zhi'an's, attacking Tongzhou with Zhao Dengyu's troops, fighting in Nanyuan with the teaching corps established not long ago, in the western suburbs with He Jifeng's Brigade under Feng Zhi'an, and fighting in Shahe with Shi Yousan's Northern Hebei Security Force. In total, in all the battles, our army took the offensive on three routes, and there were no major victories or defeats on the Ping Han Line. On the Tianjin-Pukou Line, our army did occupy Fengtai Station for two hours, but because the enemy's barracks were too fortified with electric fences, landmines, and other defensive works, after eleven assaults, they were never taken down, so before long even the station could not be held. On the Tongzhou route, we originally had a battalion of people living outside the west gate of Tongzhou. When the battle started, our reinforcements were too slow, and we did not transfer them away early, so they were tragically annihilated by the enemy. Our attacking troops encountered the enemy between Peiping and Tongzhou and engaged in fierce fighting, with no clear victory or defeat. However, the three routes of the enemy's attack on our army were very bad: First of all, in the Nanyuan area, this was where the headquarters of the 29th Army was located, and Deputy Commander Tong Linge was stationed there. However, there were no defensive works at all, nothing but a circle of earthen walls and trenches. And what was especially strange was that beforehand, it seemed that they did not even know that there would be a battle here at all. Therefore, when the enemy lined up heavy artillery to attack Nanyuan, our teaching corps stationed in Nanyuan immediately fell into a state of complete helplessness: the earthen walls were soon flattened under the bombing of artillery and aircraft, the subordinates could not find the officers, and the officers could not find the subordinates. As a result, these more than 3,000 teaching corps, who had never fought before (they were all high school or junior high school graduates), had only to rely on their flesh and blood, each doing his duty, and fighting desperately with the enemy's artillery and aircraft. As a result, more than 2,000 were killed or wounded, and only a small number escaped. And Tong Linge, who was also the head of the teaching corps, as well as Feng Guowei, the son of Feng Yuxiang, and Mr. Duan, the grandson of Duan Qirui, were also buried inside. Regarding this heroic spirit of sacrifice itself, what more can we say than to pay our respects? However, we feel that this kind of sacrifice without regard to effect, this unprepared sacrifice, is too tragic, too trifling with human life! Rather than sacrificing in such a confused way, it would be better to transfer them away early, so as to preserve a part of the nation's promising youth, which is also to leave behind a bit more vitality. Nanyuan fell on the afternoon of the 28th. As a result, Peiping had lost contact with our army on the Ping Han Road, and was surrounded by the enemy on three sides. In the Xiyuan area, our army fought very bravely. Although under the daily onslaught of enemy artillery and aircraft, the loyal He Jifeng Brigade was able to support until night, when Song Zheyuan and other senior personnel retreated, and then they withdrew. In the Shahe area, Shi Yousan's troops were defeated in two consecutive battles under the heavy pressure of the enemy and collapsed to the southwest: and the most strange thing was that the Ruan Xuanwu Brigade under Zhang Zizhong of the 38th Division stationed in Beiyuan actually stayed put and stood idly by. As the battle developed to the night of the 28th, our army was completely in a position of inferior defeat. At that time, Peiping had only two roads to take strategically: one was to abandon it, and the other was to transfer all the forces that had collapsed or not collapsed in the four suburbs into the city, plus more than 10,000 constitutional police, security teams, etc. in the city, to make a final stand and wait for our army to rescue them. However, Song Zheyuan took the first path. - Thus, Peiping fell.</p>
<p>From the battle situation on the mountain that day, it can be said to be a complete defeat. Where was there any victory to speak of! All the victory news was completely unfounded.</p>
<p>So, where did these inaccurate news come from? What was the effect?</p>
<p>The first to be blamed by a group of people were the journalists. They were disappointed and resentful, thinking that the journalists' words were completely unreliable, and even suspected that they had been bought off by others, and scolded them for having no personality. One of my friends angrily declared loudly: "I will never read these lying newspapers again in the future!"</p>
<p>In fact, it is completely unjust to place the responsibility for this same false news on the journalists. In order to answer this question, we must describe the actual situation in Peiping that day.</p>
<p>From the night of the 27th until the night of the 28th, during this period, the surroundings of Peiping were completely filled with the sound of gunfire, and it was not only impossible to distinguish the victory or defeat of the two sides, but even the direction from which each sound came was not clear. Except for one or two that were used to transport輸 troops, the city gates were completely closed. The outside of the city was the front line, and the clues were very complicated, and it was completely impossible to investigate the news on the ground. At this time, there were only a few sources of news: First, the official agencies that were always responsible for external announcements, second, semi-official agencies (such as the Jinde Society, etc.), and individuals related to the battle or the official side, and third, the foreign embassies.</p>
<p>For example, everyone had already heard the news that Fengtai had been recovered, but it was not until it was formally verified by the Jinde Society Pacification Commissioner's Office and confirmed by a certain military officer of the German Embassy that it was first printed and sold by a certain newspaper. Although the sources of other news were different, they were still from these few aspects. Even so, it is by no means possible to say that the initial source of every piece of news is the above three aspects. Sometimes, they often hear it from other aspects and describe it. Therefore, many news items have been repeatedly relayed and changed their original appearance before being printed in newspapers and announced to readers. News of this kind that cannot be traced to its source is also very钓; however, compared, there are still more official sources.</p>
<p>As for the effect of spreading these news items, I think, for the most part, it was because of satisfying everyone's inner hopes and fantasies, and thus, consciously or unconsciously, everyone relayed them, making them gradually exaggerated, and the more they talked, the more they seemed to be true. Naturally, there was also a small part of it that was a certain aspect's way of covering up their retreat. However, whether it is the former or the latter, it is always stupid and clumsy, and when compared with the scene the next day, we always feel that our Chinese nation has made a joke here. This is really a matter of laughing or crying!</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Attack the Coastal Areas of Chaozhou and Meizhou</h3>
<p>Attempt to Enter Shantou Port Under the Cover of Foreign Ships</p>
<p>Coastal Fishing Boats Detained and Fishermen Killed</p>
<p>Enemy Espionage Agency in Yunxiao Destroyed</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Since the enemy announced the blockade of our coastline, four enemy ships, the Hayate, Uzutake, Sanae, and Wakatake, have been anchored near the Biaojiao Red Butterfly Line, De Island, and Chi'ao Lighthouse, eight miles from Ma Yu Kou, to control the key points of the entrance to Shantou Port, Shanghai, and the Nanyang shipping lanes. They removed their gun covers and questioned foreign ships entering and leaving. Shantou and Nan'ao are only separated by a narrow strip of water. At this moment, traffic is cut off. Fishing boats and sailboats cannot travel near the coast. Even the Chaozhou Customs patrol ships cannot go to sea to perform their inspection duties. Moreover, the enemy ships wanted to take advantage of this period to repeatedly try to enter the port under the cover of foreign ships. All were stopped by the signals issued by the Aotou mine team and could not succeed. Enemy ships interrogated foreign ships traveling in the high seas at night with signal lights, and used searchlights to illuminate the coastal villages of Chenghai and Chaoyang, driving away the boats fishing at sea, or even intercepting them. Salt, rice, and fresh fish on the boats were all looted. Fishermen who were captured were injected with medicine in both arms, causing their limbs to ache and making them unable to resist. It can be said to be inhumane. On the 29th of last month, nine fishing boats sailed to Chi'ao to cast their nets, and they never returned. According to fishermen, the fishing boats were sunk by enemy ships, and more than 70 fishermen died tragically. The families of the deceased reported to the Shantou Maritime Police Station on the 4th of this month, asking for ways to retrieve the corpses. Most of the fishermen in Shanwei, Jiao Xiao, and Zhao'an are unemployed, and fish are several times more expensive. Also, on the morning of the 4th, three enemy ships sailed from the Fujian border, passing the fishing boats off the coast of Nan'ao outside the Shantou estuary. All were shot at, and one fishing boat was captured and set on fire. Eleven fishermen died. The enemy ships then went to Shanwei, Magong, and Houmen in Haifeng County to intercept our anti-smuggling ships, firing cannons and sinking many sailboats. There were more than 100 marines on the ships, attempting to land. They were countered by our garrison troops with cannons, and after an hour of battle, enemy ships were hit by artillery shells, wounded and retreated from Magong, and then sent two seaplanes to bomb Ma Shi, Jiazi, and Shanwei. The enemy ships finally retreated at 2 pm, because the coastal defense troops were prepared.</p>
<p>In Yunxiao County, Fujian Province, the enemy had set up an espionage agency in the area, which was recently destroyed by the garrison troops. Plans to sabotage Fujian and Guangdong were found. The enemy spy chief, surnamed Song, ostensibly opened a pharmacy, but secretly colluded with civilian troops and bandits, provided them with food and weapons, and surveyed detailed transportation maps of Zhao'an, Yunxiao, and Pinghe, planning to respond to enemy naval and air force attacks. He also sent people to Gulangyu to participate in the organization of the "pseudo-Southern Fujian Autonomous Government," calling for anti-communism and pro-Japanese. Yunxiao is only a few hours' drive from Shantou, and is the throat of transportation between Fujian and Guangdong. Since the agency was destroyed, the military police followed the maps to arrest the traitorous agencies in Chaozhou and Shantou, and arrested more than 100 lurking traitors in one fell swoop. Eighty-four of them, with solid evidence of crimes, have been executed by shooting. Most of the traitors in the area had been specializing in smuggling to evade taxes a year ago. Now that the Japanese consulate has withdrawn and lost its support, they have become traitors. Since the espionage agency was destroyed, many traitors who slipped through the net have fled to other ports. However, the enemy's plan to break through Fujian and Guangdong has suffered a serious blow.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Organizations Are Established One After Another</h3>
<p>Professional Circles Pass Important Cases</p>
<p>Capital to Hold Art Exhibition</p>
<p>The Municipal Professional Circles National Salvation Association has been actively working since its preparation. The inaugural meeting was officially held at 3:00 pm the day before yesterday (12th). No less than 700 members and representatives of group members attended. Guests included Wang Xiaolai, Xie Liuyi, Yang Jialin, and newspaper reporters.

The most important of these were "requesting the government to order entrepreneurs not to easily lay off employees during the war of resistance, at least maintaining a minimum standard of living," "establishing a solicitation team for national salvation bonds in professional circles," and so on.</p>
<p>The Shanghai student community, in order to unite students from all over Shanghai and increase the strength of resistance against Japan and saving the nation, previously organized the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Student Community Salvation Association. It is now known that preparations have been completed and more than 30 units have joined the group, and the inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held at 2:00 pm today. At that time, each student group is requested to send four representatives with their notification letters to attend. The association has also sent letters to party and government agencies requesting them to send personnel to attend and provide guidance.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Higher Education Committee for Literacy, the Literacy Teachers and Students Association, and mass education experts jointly launched the Shanghai Mass Education National Salvation Association, which was established the day before yesterday. More than 200 members attended. Liu Qiming served as chairman and Bao Shangxian served as recorder. The organization plan and the proposal to request the Social Bureau to assign mass education work were passed. The communication address is at No. 206 Beihai Road, and mass education in the city will be promoted from today.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama Circle National Salvation Association has formed national salvation drama troupes since the War of Resistance, and has gone to various parts of the interior to work. It is now known that the 12th team has been organized by Ling He, You Jing, and others, and was formally established the day before yesterday. Ling He was elected as the team leader, and You Jing and others were assigned to be the playwrights and directors. The actors include Yin Yang, Xiao Kun, Gao Liping, Xia Guojiong, Mo Yanni, Sha and more than 20 others. The team's work is temporarily scheduled to be performed for wounded soldiers, refugees, and citizens in this city.</p>
<p>All members of the National Salvation Propaganda Department of the Children's Community National Salvation Association have been working hard for more than a week and have now completed 200 cartoons for the national salvation of fierce children. Due to environmental reasons in Shanghai, they will go to Nanjing to hold an exhibition. Representatives left for the capital this morning to contact and prepare everything. Wang Renlu and Zhou Tianlai edited "Chinese Children," a children's education reading material for the extraordinary period, which is scheduled to be published on the 20th.</p>
<p>More than 100 students who have received training in this city, including Luo Guangbing, etc., in view of the start of the all-out war of resistance, believe that all of our people should rise up and respond in order to increase the strength of resistance, and that the trained students should especially take the lead. Therefore, the Shanghai Trained Students National Salvation Association was organized, and a preparatory meeting was held yesterday at Guangxia Middle School. Li Linqi of the Municipal Citizen Training Office, 𠉽 Zhongbiao Yang Jialin of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Hu Zining Tian Zhi of the Municipal Social Bureau were hired to serve as instructors. From today, please bring your certificates (military training graduation diplomas or certificates) to the registration office of the association's preparatory office (Guangxia Middle School) at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Muyu Lane to register.</p>
<h3>Workers of Japanese Cotton Mills Request Relief</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, factories in the war zone have all ceased operations. Tens of thousands of workers have suddenly lost their jobs. The Shanghai Local Association has sent a letter to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau to organize registration and find ways to provide relief to unemployed workers in Japanese-owned cotton mills, both domestic and foreign. A special representative was dispatched to request relief from Party and government organs. It is reported that the Municipal Party Department has sent Li Weixiong, together with Du Liang from the Social Bureau, to conduct an investigation in order to find a way to handle the matter. It is reported that the Party and government authorities have decided to register unemployed workers and find ways to send them back to their hometowns to prevent them from wandering around Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade Urgently Requests Idlers Not to Stand in the Streets</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade hereby issues a public notice, urgently requesting idlers not to gather in the streets. In recent times, fires and stray bullet injuries have occurred frequently within the Settlement. When the Municipal Council Fire Brigade dispatches vehicles to the scene of the incident for firefighting or rescue, there are always large numbers of idlers standing in the streets to watch. This kind of meaningless behavior seriously hinders firefighting or rescue work. The actions of the fire brigade personnel prioritize speed, so that first aid can be administered to the injured in a short time and they can be sent to the hospital for treatment. If there are idlers gathering at the scene of the incident, the work of the fire brigade personnel will inevitably be delayed. Moreover, if the injuries of the injured are caused by stray bullets, there are bound to be shrapnel or stray bullets in the vicinity of the scene of the incident. The danger of being hit by bullets is even greater for pedestrians who gather to watch. In the event of an accident, the fire brigade personnel may feel that their hearts are willing but their strength is insufficient. Therefore, all sectors of the public must understand this meaning and must not watch in the streets again, so as to avoid harm to both public and private interests.</p>
<h3>Industrial Circles Send Representatives to Console Soldiers at the Front Lines</h3>
<p>At the joint meeting of important industrial groups and organizations held the day before yesterday, it was proposed that the heroic resistance of our military generals and soldiers during the month of the Shanghai War not only terrified the enemy, but also shocked all countries in the world. In order to show the respect of the industrial community, Hu Xiyuan was publicly elected as a representative to pay tribute to the two commanders-in-chief, Zhang Zhizhong and Zhang Fakui, and to go to the front lines to console the generals and soldiers separately.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Notice Regarding Settlement Refugee Statistics</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's statistics on the 10th of this month, there are a total of 116 refugee shelters within the Settlement inspected by the Council's Health Department, accommodating a total of 61,835 refugees. 69 people were vaccinated on the 10th, and 2,294 people were injected with preventive vaccines. According to statistics on the 12th, there were 115 shelters, accommodating 60,815 refugees. No one was vaccinated on the 11th, and 306 people were injected with preventive vaccines.</p>
<h3>All Group and School Relocations Must Be Reported</h3>
<p>Since the military uprising in this city, many legitimate groups and schools have relocated. However, a small number have not reported to the Social Bureau, resulting in documents not being delivered. It is reported that the Bureau yesterday issued another notice stating that the above-mentioned groups and schools must report by letter within one week.</p>
