<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國對華政策的展望</h3>
<p>— 幸</p>
<p>英國出口信用担保局駐華代表巴特利克已於本月十一日到滬。巴氏此來的任務。我們從去年十月間中英信用大借欵消息傳來時。英國出口信用。担保局總經理尼克遜所發表的談話就可以領略一二。當時尼克遜氏否認一千萬鎊信用借欵之說但也說到該局派定一位駐華代表使英國對華的出口信用可以增加。無論如何。巴氏此來足使中英關係增進。是可斷言的。</p>
<p>從目前的英國對華政策。我們有着兩種認識第一英國的對華政策是它一般外交上和平政策的一環。英美法自去年九月間建立世界貨幣協定以來。不但在世界經濟的發展上避免了循環貶值的惡戰。而且在世界三大民治國家之間還結成了強固的聯合陣綫到目前為止這三大國的合作可說已成了世界和平的重心。維持世界和平既是英國外交的核心。而遠東和平又不能和世界和平分割英國對於遠東安定的要求當然是很急切的了第二。英國對華政策的中心原則是從現實利益上出發的在遠東方面英國的金融利益比任何國家都來得大尤其在中國長江以南近年更增加了許多新的投資利益。英國因要保衛這些現實的利益。對於中國政治上經濟上的困難也就不能坐視不救了。</p>
<p>自從中國施行法幣政策以來英國憑着它在遠東市塲的力量對於中國金融。建立了合作的基礎。這種合作精神。在中國經濟建設。及遠東和平秩序上。顯已收了極大的成就。此次巴特利克氏來華。英國對華輸出信用如能大量供給則中國經濟建設固將愈益進步遠東局勢也將更趨安定這是可以預期的。</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>廠需漸見發展</p>
<p>棉市轉緊一歩</p>
<p>加之紗花差價太遠</p>
<p>棉市略形堅挺、因陝甘政局不静、西北來源恐受阻礙、兼之紗花差價距離太遠、新抛者愈見缺乏、同時現棉廠需發展、市氣轉緊一歩云、</p>
<p>棉花檯面堅穩　標花前市開盤、美印棉市均見下落、而跌勢未熾、大勢仍不脱盤旋之局、故市塲情形無大變遷、但大阪三品花近日起伏甚大、各月又漲四·五角至一元七·八角二元外、人心重振、各月均見上升、結果各月比上日收盤價漲一角至二角半、午後開盤市態稍平疲、因三品花再跌一元外、塲中抛賣者不旺、故檯面尚能支持、結果近月比上午收盤價尚平、遠月漲五分、查賣出合興一千二百擔、同豐一千擔、福康一千二百擔、益康一千七百擔、長和一千二百擔、賡豐二千九百擔、大豐九百擔、信誠九百擔、買進同孚一千一百擔、裕大一千二百擔、仁豐二千四百擔、元一六千四百擔、大昌成一千四百擔、長豐一千一百擔、潤康一千一百擔、源大一千擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>期紗自絢爛歸於平淡</p>
<p>總恩結賬期期近</p>
<p>雙方鉑無結束</p>
<p>紗市平静、交易殊形淸淡、故拍板時間較短、實則總結賬時期日近、多空兩方皆有一度結束、客銷不動、人心更乏起勁、加之大阪三品紗狂升猛降、飄摇不定、使人殊難捉摸、三品紗昨日恢復全天營業、開盤大漲、收盤回跌、午後開盤再跌、收盤平平、結果比上日價均跌五角至七元四角云、</p>
<p>賡豐晨進午出　標紗前市開盤、各月轉趨高翔、因上日狂跌之三品紗復趨上升七八元至十元、人心激昻、賡豐又來大量獨進二月期、遠期牽動、市盤緩歩上漲、但現紗生意岑寂、同業仍無抵補之念、但三品收盤價回挫、跌三四元至六元、電到、標紗已經收盤矣、標紗結果、各月比上日收盤價均漲一元三四五八角、午後開盤、因下午三品紗開盤價再跌四五六元、市况受其打擊、但新賣者未見十分踴躍、跌勢未濃、現紗交易仍微薄、賡豐又來賣出、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌四六九角至一元一角、賡豐大昌成均晨買午賣、查賣出裕大一千二百包、聚興五百包、恒益四百包、森康七百包、仁豐七百五十包、望泰興一千三百包、頥大五百五十包、泰昌五百包、益昶一千零五十包、買進振大一千六百五十包、合興一千九百五十包、泰興四百包、潤康七百五十包、恊成一千六百包、源大六百包、生源六百包、明德四百包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>美棉多頭了結不了</p>
<p>同業仍在等候借欵棉花之進展</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月跌八磅音至漲一磅音、交易尚活、正月期因有交割通知單二十二紙、多頭了結而跌、遠月初因同業活動買進而堅、後因三月期至一角二分半、多頭繼續了結、卒以同行買意衰頽、商人觀望、市面疲勢、外商多空均有、同業仍在等候借欵棉花之進展、收盤堅穩、計現貨跌三磅音、期貨跌二至四磅音、英棉現貨漲六點、期貨不動、印棉初因日紗猛跌而疲、旋以股市上漲、同業及投懷家買進而回、卒因棉商跨賣及空户抛售、市價再軟、計平果爾跌○·五○至○·七五羅比、奥姆辣跌○·二五至○·七五羅比、白羅溪跌一·二五羅比、原電錄左、（十三日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十四日開盤預測、白羅溪爲二百三十一羅比、奥姆辣爲二百○八羅比、平果爾爲一百八十四羅比二五、均跌○·二五羅比、</p>
<p>三品紗跌風仍厲</p>
<p>十四日大阪電、三品紗各月均跌一元六角至七元四角、近月收盤爲二百八十五元五角、遠月爲二百六十六元一角、又棉花除遠月漲一元三角五分至一元一角五分、餘月均跌六角五分至一元四角、近月收盤爲七十五元三角、遠月爲七十八元一角、</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>棉布隨紗市爲轉移</p>
<p>客帮紛紛搜羅現貨</p>
<p>昨棉布以三品紗市續歩挫落、國內紗銷不振、本色棉布東疋細布細斜續跌（每疋）二分半至五分、本廠細布細斜跌二分半至一角、組布市盤平定、色布色斜直貢嗶嘰綫呢價均平穩、現銷漸見增加、良以期貨價格一致高昂、客帮搜羅廉價現貨之心思益見活動、北路山東帮續辦白地色丁六元三四角、克羅綢七元一二角之貨、一百餘箱、滇帮添辦本廠細斜一百餘包、本街批發莊及染廠續辦白貨細布細斜原布色布坯子現貨三百餘包、川粤閩長江寗波等帮進胃均稱不惡、致市勢仍殊鞏固、進口日貨售盤續堅、中擋斜羽綢昨由岩井洋行開出三·四月份期貨近百箱、價已自（每碼）五角三角升至六角六分半云、</p>
<p>元芳疋頭叫價减色</p>
<p>昨爲本埠元芳洋行第三千零二十三次拍賣、爲陰歷年關、仍照舊規開放六禮拜延期現銀出貨、陳列泰西緞元絨直貢呢羽綢洋紅布五種、拍價比上期遜色、拍開泰西緞五牌、獅合猴每碼降三分、狐牛陣漲四分、直貢呢升三分、元絨平立、羽綢拍五十一牌、安殿寶疋價漲七角七五、竹林伯子兩牌升半元、海牛惟妙兩牌各降五角、其餘祗一二角上落、然平者居多、洋紅布拍七磅、係重磅貨、缺貨已久、業中互相抬價競爭、價獨挺秀云、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>麵粉欲漲反跌</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初穩繼跌之象、以十三日路透紐約電、芝加哥麥市開盤、外國電訊良好、傳英將進行收儲小麥及糧食計劃、現需殷繁、市面堅穩、價漲二五至八七五、又坎拿大漲一角零、利物浦漲一辨士零、當開價後、因洋麥回漲、人心未免轉佳、各月份較前日好起一分零、惟目下實銷不暢、業中人均少問訊、因此交易稀少、市面不能硬挺、故至收盤、即回跌一分外、迨至下午開盤、本月份半因結賬、半因實銷未見暢抽、業外略有回出、市面即覺不振、遠期亦因買氣不旺、業中人又多看小面、故亦歩歩鬆落、照目下情形、總因物價過高、銷塲暗减致投機者亦難爲力云、</p>
<p>麥市奄無生氣</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份大致呈停寂之態、惟以總結賬之故、客路交易、逐歩結束、市塲之爭競既少、致出入無多、生色毫無、各月份祇有一二分之進出、迨至下午開盤、交易比較暢旺、遠期亦略見起色、惟本月份因現銷不暢、人心甚平、以紛銷不振、麥市自頻帶疲、現麥情形、更趨沉寂、因市上祗有交易、大批之貨、均已上棧、所以統市又祇千餘包交易、價無變動、</p>
<p>客秈交易已見减退</p>
<p>昨市僅成交六千餘包</p>
<p>昨客秈到頭仍有萬包以上、但粤汕兩帮運日暢辦以後、進胃略懈、本街以囤户觀望、消胃亦减、統市成交數、乃從二三萬包减至八千餘包、到多銷細市已見軟、加之貨主紛紛求售、形勢更軟、幸大部份貨主不願輕脱市價祇帶小二三分而已、全日開出贛米四千六百三十包、浙米二百包、漢糙五百包、甬元六百十五包、小絞六十包、汕粤兩帮共去二千包、其餘盡出本街收進、</p>
<p>食米本街略有動辦</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到有五十餘號、貨共萬一千二三百石、內中薄稻有二十六七號、本街銷塲較前稍動、不過于胃口依然淸淡、祗青島帮辦薄稻近二千包、致薄稻市况猶屬疲軟、行情續修幾分至角許、南港早稻亦短數分、僅蘇同粳因供求相仿、無所榮辱、然形勢亦帶軟象耳、杜洋尖及陰變元、尚屬定局、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船念六七艘、市上各貨銷塲各店揀巧者略見動化、白粳價與前市相仿、薄稻高貨挺秀、中次帶軟、早稻去路尚可、價形堅定、陰元貨稀銷活、價形緊俏、白元貨旺、零貨不暢、價軟數分、其餘各貨、價形平定之勢、</p>
<p>豆餅趨勢頗形樂觀</p>
<p>近日豆餅市况頗形樂觀　蓋大連市既漲多跌少、黄豆行情因之亦易升難挫、標準市價、堅守穩固之局、致引起套賣心思交易、且汕頭厦門等銷塲、續有問津、所以行情每盤趨升分譜、昨市照長德廠報告、該廠四牌餅已開至二元零五分、昌記廠四牌開二元零四分、惟大昌新廠開二元零二分、統市成交各廠四牌廠一萬五千片云、</p>
<h3>金融</h3>
<p>標金仍見疲弱</p>
<p>多方及現貨號均售</p>

<h3>特載</h3>
<p>— （叔斐譯）</p>
<p>紙價暴漲原因（續）</p>
<p>上海的紙業市塲，在一九三六年的上半年中，比較尚還平静。德産與加拿大産的捲筒紙，交易甚旺。成交價格，均在每噸六鎊十九先令，至七鎊十七先令六便士之間的低價。一月間，加拿大紙，曾謀將價格提高至八鎊五先令，但其結果，終以不能與德紙的低價相競爭，而於三月間，降至七鎊十八先令。在一月間，一般紙商的經濟地位，大見危殆，廢歷新年中，有紙商八家，及銀號若干家，均曾陷於停止狀態中。春間的華北走私潮，雖然依於海關的報告，除香烟紙外，其他紙貨，未有走私的輸入，但紙業界及滙兑界，已因而顯呈不安定與煩慮。上海的紙價，截至八月間，常盤旋於低價之中，更其是「純質印報紙」，（Woodtreeprintfngs）與「大號寫字紙」，（Cap）更形不振，不過在這時期中，「機器用紙」，（Mechanical　Prints）「大號寫字紙」，「彩印紙」，（Clromo）與「純質印報紙」，也在低價之下，與德商作成了不少很可觀的交易。加拿大與斯于迭那維亞各國的「牛皮紙」（Kraft　Paper），以及美國的上等紙張，如「公文用紙」（Document　Paper）之類，交易也相當的暢旺。</p>
<p>去年的五六月間，是上海紙市最不振的時期，七月至九月之間，略見起色。加拿大紙，因世界市塲，日趨高漲，而於九月間，將價格提高，於是美國紙，便榮機活動。在八九月間，美産印報紙，以七鎊十七先令六便士、獲得了若干定單。十月，德産印報紙，漲至八鎊十五先令，而斯干迭那維亞産的印報紙，漲至九鎊之上。牛皮紙與大號寫字紙的交易，也很暢旺。十一月間，傳聞德國各紙廠，售出之消息，於是沉寂已久的斯干迭那維亞紙，榮機活動。但斯干迭那維亞紙的供應力殊弱，因而在十一月末，十二月初的價格，扶摇直上。捲筒紙，漲至每噸十二鎊左右，較諸年初每噸八磅之價，已高百分之五十。大號寫字紙及牛皮紙，雖紙商自願依掛牌增加二十先令以上的代價，還是無法收購。因爲十一月十二月的價格昂騰，一般紙商之擁有存貨的，無不大獲其利。十二月中旬的西安事變，給與了紙業界的以兜頭的一勺冷水。在時局演變的十三天中，上海的紙價，幾有一蹶不振之勢。但一經解决之後，便立即回復了原有繁榮。</p>
<p>總觀去年一年中，中國所消耗的外國紙，德居首位。海關對於紙類的徵税，全年中，未有變動。十一月間，利用庚欵，開始在滬籌設一外人經理的造紙廠，因着原料的價值低廉，以及紙價的昂貴，其前途的發達，必然是可預卜的。在温州設立造紙廠的計劃，仍在擱淺中。在廣州設廠製紙之議，在最近期中，也還不能見諸實施。（完）</p>

<h3>谷崎氏的「戀愛與色情」</h3>
<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>女性乃西洋純文學的基調</p>
<p>東洋女性缺乏永遠的崇高</p>
<p>鶉鷸隴雜纂是谷崎潤一郎最近的隨筆集，乃搜集曾發表在中央公論上之諸隨想隨筆而成的，這集子包含有戀愛及色情，陰翳禮讚，我所見的大阪和大阪人，憶東京，春琴抄後語，我的貧窮故事，青春故事等等。其中戀愛及色情，可以説是谷崎氏對於東西洋的特徵與文化所下的評語，</p>
<p>在戀愛與色情之中，谷崎氏籠統地把西洋純文學看做必然地是處理男女間愛情的東西。把那些以動物爲題材或冒險社會等的小説，看做是非純粹的文學；説東洋的文字，則似乎竭力在避免女性與男性的交涉。譬如李白的「峨眉山月半輪秋，影入平羗江水流，夜發淸溪向三峽，思君不見下渝州。」這首詩裏的思君不見，表面似乎是指的明月，但從峨眉山月四字推測起來，隱隱約約地有暗示着戀人的地方；他解説像這樣的能進大雅之堂的東洋貴族文學，都不一定像西洋的必然地以男女關係爲題材，縱或有了，也隱約不顯，這完全是受着經典和舊禮教的束縛的緣故。不過在平安朝的文學，如採竹故事，源氏物語等等，相當地對女人拂着敬意，並且後者是專門以男女的交涉爲題材的。</p>
<p>平安朝以後的鎌倉時代的文字，很少以男女的戀愛故事爲題材的，但到了徳川時代（江户時代）像西鶴的「好色物」，近松的「心中物」就勃發起來，但那些取理男女的戀愛故事爲題材的作品，在當時被看成爲一種戲作和低級品，猶之繪畫藝術上的最能表達現世相貌的「浮世繪」被當時的上流社會所抹煞無視一般。在這些作品裏出現的女性，常把她們完全描成爲「永遠的」「崇高的」「神聖的」相對物，男性站在女性的上面；這可説是與平安朝的作品相異之處；平安朝作品之崇拜女性的特徵，據谷崎氏解釋起來，頗與西洋的諸作品的那種精神相一致。西洋的作品裏，男性把自己的戀人，看成是聖母瑪麗亞，是「永遠的女性」之姿容，究其這種觀念的根本原因，實是身體和氣候的影響所致。</p>
<p>東洋的文學，（除了平安朝的特例外）不能與西洋的文字同樣地歌頌女性，實在由於東洋的女性之美，和男子的體力上有不及西洋的地方，東洋女性在處女時代是她的黄金時代，一過這幾年，就失掉了妖艷乃至魅惑的能力，但西洋的女性達到其美的極致，是在結婚後的約三十一二歳時代，所以在這肉體美的持久上，西洋女性就有種崇高的精神；所以西洋有所謂『神聖的淫婦』或『淫亂的貞婦』這種典型，日本則不得有，日本女人一與男性接觸以後，就立刻失掉了處女的健康和端麗，血色姿態也都衰敗，成了與醜業婦同樣的下品之淫婦了。</p>
<p>這地方是述明在東洋的諸作品中，不能把女性描寫成爲「永遠」「崇高」的東西之原因。同時谷崎氏還説，由於東洋男性的性慾與色慾的澹泊——對女性的眷戀每在達到了肉慾的滿足後，立刻就起厭憎之念——的那種情形，也是使之不能崇高女性。這種肉慾的澹泊，甚之連有超人的精神與肉體的德川家康（在明治維新前掌握了日本天下三百年的德川家之始祖）也是如此。谷崎引德川的話道：「女人不應久睡於丈夫的床上，在性交之後宜立即離去，才能被丈夫所深愛」的這句話，更證明東洋男性的肉慾之澹泊。</p>
<p>以上是谷崎氏對於色情與戀愛的一種解説，但他這種含有否定了在社會關係上的愛並男女地位之關鍵，專在肉體上求其根源，當然也是近乎「盲目」的。但作爲一個作家的這種非合理的觀察之告白，對於讀者在若干的深度上，却使之極易理解了作爲谷崎氏作品內的「色情與戀愛」之基調。</p>
<h3>音訊</h3>
<p>— 禾金</p>
<p>「我並不憂傷，我不能哭泣，</p>
<p>所有我底記憶都教安息；</p>
<p>我看那河流變得更潔白而奇異，</p>
<p>整日夜我看它變移。」</p>
<p>—E.　Dow　on</p>
<p>冬夜沅落得有無限的深。我倦睡在床上——我底心醒着。</p>
<p>冷！——外面，没有風也没有雪，四野裏是　静的，兀立着像一個巨大的死屍——然而那寒冷！——寒冷上染了漆黑的喪色：燈熄滅了；窗外，没有月亮，没有星星，我猜想那一定又是一個怕人的夜。</p>
<p>我睜着刺痛的眼睛，不移地看向那無邊的黑暗中去——我覺得，在自己底心的中心，燃着一星若明若滅的熖燼，這熖燼喘息在無邊的漆黑中，作着無助的摇曳，用牠如豆的螢光，費力地照見周圍的方寸地……</p>
<p>於是，由於牠，我才摸淸我與外界的分界綫；由於牠，我才知道我與外面的漆黑原是二個相異的個體。</p>
<p>然而絲毫無來由地，一種異樣的波浪衝擊了起來，我受着支解的楚病——那種曠坦內沉静化爲無限的凄凉，像潮汐後的荒寂的沙灘。一分鐘前的，環行着有節奏的永流的蒼海，而今成了乾涸的死野，綿亙到千萬里没有人烟。有的僅僅是一羽喪服的鴟鷹，縱横衝折地躪亂着這孤寂的方寸地；又如誰個厭生的夜行客，在暴亂地叩響一塊荒塚的墓碑……</p>
<p>然而周圍仍然是一片空曠的，然助的凄凉！</p>
<p>我疑心，那音訊也許便是「死」……！</p>
<p>「死！」我感到一陣冷冽，我彷彿看見一座巨大晶螢的冰山，一種如水的寒凉傳澈我底肢體——第一次我從這中間認取了嚴肅的悲哀。這一回，一死所給與我的，不再是一種若遠若近的，黑暗的恫嚇；而却是一種悲壯的偉大的容儀。我彷彿是在面對一位親切的，懇摯的先生。在他底面前，人開始有那種决心要抛棄自己底人類的精塗，而想到加急地趕行人生的路程；也祇有在他面前，人才能有勇氣來撫摸自己底楚痛。他教我們擎起人生的火把，於是，使我們放下來安息。他賦與我們以一種高山流水的心情，他也使我們暇想孤島高空中的行雲。</p>
<p>我們今日倚肩同行。</p>
<p>到明天我們必</p>
<p>相互道聲「告别」！</p>
<p>悲壯，嚴肅，音訊傳響着如仙童的鋃角。我疑心那便是自然的語音，是足以奪去人類底感謝的温情。</p>
<p>我們今日緊握着手，</p>
<p>到明天我們就</p>
<p>各自分散了走……</p>
<p>響音——那音訊，響着。</p>
<p>我感到沉重的無恒的足音，從遠方得得地行近來，足上繫着繁響的銀鈴，這之間打出新切的，可感的信號；我感到在人生的道路中，我已來到了一個應該開始急奔了的時候——那時候，眼淚將不足以濯去我永世的悔恨，嬉笑將不足以抹掉我成年的楚痛。那説不盡的凄凉的音訊傳給我以更多更多的無聲的言語，我聽那遠來的銀鈴决然以行去……</p>
<p>是夜，是無訴的夜。在我中間摇曳着一點星火，我聽他用如豆的螢光，費力地照亮周圍的方寸地。</p>
<h3>明天</h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>恨糟心的日子過得太慢，</p>
<p>我狠狠的撕去日曆，</p>
<p>一頁一頁投給火熖，</p>
<p>我要撕出心裏的明天。</p>
<p>三百六十天已經撕完，</p>
<p>露頭一個鉛臉的元旦，</p>
<p>黑暗淤塞了潮流的河，</p>
<p>在歡呼聲裏我寂寞。</p>
<h3>漫憶</h3>
<p>— 思慕</p>
<p>海外的除夕「接吻無禁」的五分鐘</p>
<p>忽然間記起桌上日曆的最後的一頁，應該撕去了。</p>
<p>「這樣子，我們便算過了年！」病榻上的妻苦笑一聲，在鉛色的薄暗裏潮熱了四個月的深陷的雙頰展動人一下，又歛回了。</p>
<p>室門外不聞下女的沉重的拖鞋響，不聞隔室朝鮮人的格格的談話聲，整個「阿帕脱」（公寓）峭寒，寥寂像荒墳一樣。</p>
<p>「新年舖子恐怕休業，替我到新宿買一點小麵包回來吧。」</p>
<p>妻—近來性情變做嬌養慣的小孩子似的妻—的戒口食物的選購，對於我是一個煞費思索的問題；好容易得了她的自動的提示，我便從事跑到我們久已不涉足的城中最熱閙的一角去。</p>
<p>寛大的街道，給「滿員」的行人，商品，燈光，和囂音窒塞着，風在這兒停了，十二月的天時像温室一般的暖和。</p>
<p>買和賣便是一切，一切盡在今宵，萬千的臉龐都泛着帶有緊張的喜色，軍需的景氣漲至要爆裂了。</p>
<p>不少女人高聳着沉重的古式的髻，洗帽子的攤子新添了好幾處，賣草繩似的門口裝飾的攤販，忙個不了，人們真個是過年呢！</p>
<p>我的脚像蟻爬那樣在這人堆和商品林中一寸一寸動着，眼睛迷惘繚亂，心裏茫然，往年在故鄉歳暮闖花市那樣的興致，不知那裏去了。</p>
<p>擠上回家去的電車，出了車站，又是另一個世界，扁圓昏黄的月在空地上灰一色的天氣中貼着，「燒烏」帳棚外的燒紅如焚的圓柱形的招牌燈籠在針似的寒風中摇曳着，布帳也撲撲作響，棚裏却然没有一個顧客。道上零落的木屐聲格外淸越。</p>
<p>回到家裏，妻已用被堆過頭睡了，火鉢頽然將熄，公寓還是那樣的寥廓。</p>
<p>本來不容易入寐的我，今晚，在閉着眼的時候，更遏不住回憶的思潮。</p>
<p>前四年的除夕也是在外國過的—並且是在咖啡店過的。在銀光四射的華燈之下，千百的五彩紙帶的飛繞交織的網裏，滿座異國男女的雜作的歡笑聲中，我跟幾個男朋友和他們的女伴，帶着好奇的心，數着時刻等待「接吻無禁」的黑暗五分鐘的來臨。</p>
<p>掛鐘終於指着十二時了，電燈突然全熄了，狂歡的舞蹈樂開始奏起來，地穴似的黑暗中擠擁着雜沓着追逐着無數憧憧的黑影，充塞着，震動着，爆裂着浪謔狂笑，歡呼的怪音，連我的同伴也擠進這漆黑的混沌裏凑熱閙去。</p>
<p>一曲才終，燈又立刻放亮，「接吻無禁」的五分鐘已過，而新歳也已在這黑暗裏躡足進來了。外頭的教堂的鐘不斷響着。</p>
<p>在歡塲，我永遠是個冷静的旁觀者，但當時我正在熾熱的友情的火熖裏焚着。縱然幻想是一個跟着一個破，但我還在幻想的深處。</p>
<p>回到中國以後的第一個除夕，是在上海過的，也是單身，也是作客。跟同一個朋友在俄國小餐館吃過晚飯，在那燈光燦然，無盡似的筆直的霞飛路往往蹈蹥了好久之後，便一同回到朋友借住的雪窖似的亭子間去。燒了一壺茶，冰殭的兩手撫着茶壺邊取煖；因爲單薄如紙的棉被經不住從洋灰地透來的徹宵的寒氣，我們還照例倒了一杯朋友自製的苦烈的白蘭地酒，喝入肚裏。煖了，興奮了，我們拉雜談了一會，便把一年的最後一刻度過。</p>
<p>是的，在那時，鐵的現實已逼入而來，但是我還刻意搆着未來的夢—傳奇般的瑰奇的夢。</p>
<p>現在呢，像是一切只爲着生活，不，爲着單純的意味上的生存，并且是僅目前的生存。</p>
<p>我縱然還没有意識到老，生活的鞭子過處，斑斑的瘀痕却赫然印在我的背上，印在我的心上。</p>
<p>明天是又一年了。但是我近來夢的只是過去，險幻可喜，重壓着我的過去。今晚—當然還是做這樣的夢，如果睡得着的話。</p>
<p>怪不得前幾天，我把歌德自傳的最末一段翻譯過來時，我瞿然驚起來，因爲我自己心裏欲吐的話給他説出來了。他説：</p>
<p>『孩子，孩子！不要説下去了，光陰的白駒像是給看不見的幽靈所鞭策那樣曳着我們的命運的輕車跑過，我們没有别的辦法，只有勇敢地鎭静着，牢牢地握着馬韁，駛轉車輪時而左，時而右，閃避石頭，躱開懸崖。這車究竟到那兒去，誰知道呢？牠從那兒來，差不多也記不淸了！』</p>
<p>但是，在這樣的年頭，『閃避石頭，躱開懸崖』也不是容易的事呵！</p>

<p>有一羣忘記了晨昏，</p>
<p>你將他們輕輕地擎上浮雲，</p>
<p>完了，一羣都完了！</p>

<h3>從“活埋”到“餵狗”</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>還是我在小學里讀書的時候，我就聽見人說：做了亡國奴是怎麽怎麽的苦：例如七家人家合用一把菜刀：如果亡國奴的主子走路走得疲勞了，就可以逼令亡國奴伏下身子來，讓主人坐在他的身上休息一下，諸如此類，真是不勝枚舉。可是就因為聽到那些宣傳亡國奴的慘痛的苦楚，所以對於做亡國奴這一件“大事”，實在是在小心里非常的恐懼的。而這種恐懼心，就是到了現在已是成人长大了，還是存在着，并且擴大着。</p>
<p>本來，只要你乘乘地，馴服地，替主人去作牛做馬，一絲一毫也不必去拗違主子的意念，那末，也未必不可以安安逸逸做一個“順民”的，可是偏偏有種人却不肯那麽照辦，這或許是不識時務者的傻子了吧？</p>
<p>南京七日電訊，有着這末一個驚人的消息，現在筆者不憚麻烦，抄錄如下：</p>
<p>關係方面擴张坦來電：熱河圍塲縣近發生一大惨案，有張榮堂等六人，近被某方憲兵，施行活埋酷刑，聞張係前熱河省議员張维成之子，最近為某方所疑，卽加以逮捕，被捕者共有二十餘人，除六名活埋外，其餘均生死不明。</p>
<p>張榮堂等只是為“某方所疑”，所以就要遭到活埋的酷刑，这眞是使甘願為人牛馬者，所要擔心的了。“疑”，尚未到“眞相大白”的階段。所以一到“真相大白”的階段，就要施行“餵狗”的酷刑了。例如，這里再抄一段新聞來加以證實這一事實：</p>
<p>據遼寗來人談：最近有某校女教員，因私通義軍，竟被某方捕去，剝去衣裤，驅入一畜有狼犬数十頭的院子內，將其活活嚙斃。</p>
<p>“活埋”與“餵狗”，雖然殊途同歸到死的境地，雖然同為慘無人道的舉動，似乎在這二十世紀的三十年代，不應再有的了，然而將歷史的輪齒倒轉的巨魔，如果不施用那種中古世紀的毒刑，似不足以戒人者然。不過，歴史無論巨魔的力量多大，牠仍是向前邁進的，活埋，餵狗，這是不足以寒人胆的呵！</p>
<p>人們越是見到那種慘無人道的舉動，越是感到憤恨，越是憤恨，就越是要打碎奴隸的枷鎖，或是拼命掙扎，務使奴隸的枷鎖，不致套上頭來。於是乎，歷史的輪⿒，依然向前邁進！</p>
<p>而施行酷刑的獸舉者，這是給人一種明證，那就是歷史的叛逆者，人類文化的大敵！</p>
<p>無論怎樣的酷刑，都嚇不退人的。不識時務者的傻子，要受那種酷刑，理所應得，然而識時務者的英傑，也未見得會太平一世的！因為主子的“疑”，是主子隨時都可疑到的，你不能統治主子，呌他不疑！</p>

<h3>駱清夫婦</h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>冒着北国裏冷酷的早風，經過那許多山村，河流，荒蕪的高梁田，狹窄而曲折的沙路，直到太陽正中的辰光，才算望見了這座充滿一股死氣的商埠——營口。</p>
<p>清晨到現在，五個多鐘頭的過程中，他們倆加緊着脚步，毫不鬆弛底行走這五六十里的長途。情形簡直和搶險是沒有半點两樣的。找到搭船碼頭的時候，四條疲乏的腿子，幾乎攀得和自己的軀壳像脱了關聯似的。</p>
<p>駱清提着二個铅皮小箱匣，慚漸地走近鐵柵去，邊走邊拍着衣衫上一層層凝冻了的寒霜，他是悶不作聲他從☓☓兵的枪架旁挤過，只像山鼠般底缩伏着長長的腦袋。繞過二個彎角，方上前將嘴巴凑近妻的耳邊，低聲兒的説道：</p>
<p>“茵！你現在可以放心些呵！”</p>
<p>做妻子的收住了脚步，把混身倚依在骆清身旁。那病後苍黃的顋巴下沉着，只是點了一頭：“你，你早點……去打船票啊！”</p>
<p>駱清把她送進“乘客待候室。”自己一個瘦削和萎顿的身影漸漸底在人叢中離遠。</p>
<p>這是在異鄉的輪埠上，一间充滿着嘈雜的人聲的屋子里。—那屋是用水門汀來支撑着鐵皮的屋顶的。在四周，在粉白的墙壁上，給“人丹”，“味の素”，“老篤……”的廣告紙佔去了大塊地方，花花綠綠地逗引着人們去關眼。可是她，祇是對這些輕意地掃射了一下，又把臉子掛下，凝眸的坐着。</p>
<p>正這時候，她耳邊突然響起了一張沙嗄的嗓子來：</p>
<p>“你到那里的，一個人嗎？”</p>
<p>“上海——”她從沉默里回過身來，站在四個穿着制服的和掛了匣子砲的人前。她混身全冒着汗，脚子又像慄慄地打軟。</p>
<p>“上海？”高個子的一個先向她遍身瞧了一眼，又把鐵尺似的東西在她那二個箱匣上輕輕擊幾下：“還有男人同行呢，女人？”</p>
<p>“男人。”茵的心臟跳動了。雖然早知無法躲過他們的檢查；可是事臨頭來，却又失了一股裝作的勇氣，感到全身不安；想抑制這心內衝動的血流，这時也變得沒有一絲勁。</p>
<p>眼看着他們一会兒，便開始老練地用手，用眼在她身上檢視起來，一個箱匣，也帶累了這同樣的翻倒和搜查。</p>
<p>“你男人那兒去了，他做什麽事業的？”</p>
<p>“買船票去，他是☓☓書局當夥計。”</p>
<p>“書局？——”高個子的把眼睛馬上擴大一點，正似乎他們是作這一職業的關係，認為大有詳細盤詰的必要，於是</p>
<p>“書坊開在那兒，老闆呌什麽？”</p>
<p>“開設在☓☓大西邊門，老闆呌☓☓☓。”</p>
<p>“他是那裏人？今年多大歲数？长的還是矮的？……”</p>
<p>“這，——問我男的去。“事前，她們知道这手續的麻煩，她們會詳細試習的。不過說的書坊，只是六年前他的職業！而現在呢，一對夫婦正是東北的流亡者啊！</p>
<p>“哼！”比較矮一點的搶步上來，这時朝她鼻子一皺，說：“你們是那兒人？到上海那裏去？”</p>
<p>“我們都是☓☓人，到上海是姑母家裏。”</p>
<p>“姑母住在上海那裏？有幾個人？”</p>
<p>“住北四川路☓☓里，一共三四個人吧！”</p>
<p>“决定地說，說！”</p>
<p>“是——是四個人。”</p>
<p>“好大膽的！你們不知是什麽勾結。一矮個子的一手指着她，阔弧的嘴巴一撇。</p>
<p>現在，這四個人更把她圍攏起來，八隻眼睛冒着火，浴着血，幾乎要把這弱小女子一口吞下肚去；他們暴怒着，那些橫肉的臉上有時却堆起笑容來，但這幾聲出口来的笑音，簡直像無数柄鋒利的尖刀，在刺觸着她的驚慌的心。</p>
<p>“男人什麽時光回來？高喉嚨的又響了。</p>
<p>“就來的。”</p>
<p>回過那話，她用手擄開了一把遮蔽在前額的亂髮，這回——却改裝作不经意似的態度，把那些絨绳球，衣裳，和一本本碎亂的書籍，當着他們𤡛兇的眼光投射之下，却非常鎮定地一叠叠藏進那箱匣去。可是她的腦海，一忽兒又似乎自己的丈夫赤裸着縛在木柱上，被人鞭揪，针刺，用嚴厲的口腔盤詰……的恐怖的情景，一幕幕的在她面前幌動</p>
<p>十分鐘過去，駱清買了票回來，他，同樣更受到一點鐘極嚴厲的詰詢，甚至連衣衫也被剝下來給細細的检閱：可是結果，沒有什麽可使他們疑竇的東西發現！</p>
<p>“放你們行吧。狗！”</p>
<p>最後挨過這駡聲，他們才侥倖地拋下了心裏那塊沉重的鉛土，離開他們踏上了船的甲板。</p>
<p>好久，妻回過笑臉來望着廣闊的海；海的一邊，便是他們的甜密的故鄉啊</p>
<h3>小品三章</h3>
<p>— 家怡</p>
<p>冬夜</p>
<p>房子裏不是一隻冰箱麽？我如一尾白了眼不能動弹的魚呢！</p>
<p>白的剝落了粉飾的牆，玻璃，書，筆…我感得冷冰冰的；唯一的灯光也𠮓得那麽微弱森寒了！是一個幽魂的地獄麽？</p>
<p>星星在高空顫抖，摇摇地要落下來似的。樹梢的幾片枯葉又不是在飲泣麽？我的四周是一個人彌留時的悲切。到處都有一缕缕告訴！</p>
<p>街頭的叫賣聲，把他內心一股的暖氣都嘔出來了——是多可憐的哀號！從那聲音中我憬憧着伴着孤燈在顫寒的憔悴的影子。犬吠無力地婉遲拖續下去，更形成這夜的冷落來。</p>
<p>轆轆的夜車像受傷的野獸爬過這黑漠的荒野，首先是嗄聲的哀號。长途的旅人做着凶險的夢寐吧：</p>
<p>凝固的思绪慚慚地遠開了；在那遼遠的天涯的古屋裏，我憬憧着掛着熱淚的老人，孤燈如豆的光下還蹲着那頭黃貓在打盹。…</p>
<p>母親…家…故鄉…孩子…不連續的思緒打成一團，又分開来像一束亂麻。</p>
<p>五年了。夜是漫漫地。囚徒的心燃啃着難耐的生命！</p>
<p>霜晨</p>
<p>禮拜堂的鐘聲在冷空中悠揚地波散到这一角。这聲音落到各人苦痛懺悔的心田。夢醒後的清晨浮上了昨夜艱澀的夢境來！</p>
<p>一切還是靜靜的。凋零零的樹木，兀然地立着。從窗口看出去，在那低矮黑色的瓦背和田圃壅上一層薄簿的霜粉。這霜粉肅殺了夜間一切的混沌的妖氛，现在的空氣是爽潔得像一朵雨後的鮮花。</p>
<p>血色的太陽被霧氣遮住篩不下光茫，人家只看得東方一個沒有光輝在爐裏的煤塊。但四處也在蒸起了嬝嬝的水汽，地球彷佛一片開始融解的冰海！</p>
<p>在一條泥路上，我有些熟人：那便是早晨推着菜車往市塲裏的老人和裹着頭包挑着担子的鄉婦。多麽偉大的職業啊！從他們的生活中我感到生的意義與热烈來。</p>
<p>太陽</p>
<p>我們爱太陽。太陽也愛我們：牠给我們的心温暖了。</p>
<p>日裏，在可蔽風的一隅，在光亮的塲上，都有許多人伴着太陽。牠也慈愛得像母親般的撫摸。一朶在笆籬下的黃花我看牠笑得媚媚的。光明，溫暖撥動了一切有機的活動，從活動中一切得到生命的可愛來。</p>
<p>少時，母親把我放在冬日的陽光下長大的。如今，我也把找的孩子放在太陽下睡覺，為的讓他多吸些温暖，温暖是一切的活動之力啊。</p>
<p>太陽照過山嶺，照到碧野，照遍大地：在牠金色的光輝下，谁都有權利盡量吸取牠的光明的，牠的氣息。惟有牠是一切偉大的慈母，一個爱的洪爐。</p>
<p>宇宙間要是沒有米斯拉斯（Mithras)，這地球上就會有阿利曼（Ahriman)的。后羿是死了，我們，青年的心裏要一個永遠睛明，快片，爽朗的天。</p>
<h3>病</h3>
<p>— 楊家鹏</p>
<p>生，老，病，死，这是人生必經的過程，而“病”還是特別接近“死”的，所以人若有病，便應重視。</p>
<p>假使一個人對於他所患的病，一點不知道治療，或者胡亂的服藥，那他的病就没有痊愈的希望！他的生命也要發生危險！</p>
<p>我說“胡亂的服藥”，是因为我覺得有些人對於藥物不知道愼重的選擇，祇聽名稱，而不问它的內容，功效。要曉得現在一般滑頭的藥品實在太多了，怎能拿生命去冒險呢</p>
<p>所以患病的人，千萬不可贪圖便宜，為走近路，去買那没有信用的藥品。然则我們将何所適從呢？现在配方最凖確。製剂最精良的，當然睢有五洲大藥房了。</p>
<h3>紅眼睛</h3>
<p>— 拂塵</p>
<p>“他是一個紅眼睛啊！”這是近來人們譏笑他的一句話。</p>
<p>本來，他的眼睛就是有病的，到了這冷天，他的眼病就格外加重，眼圈發癢！眼球發赤！真是“觀之不雅”。</p>
<p>他怕别人譏笑，躲在家裏不出門，但在家裏也是一樣的有苦惱呢！讀書，閱報，眼睛都感覺得酸痛，他不知道怎樣才能解除眼睛上的障害！</p>
<p>他正在難受着的時候，忽然有人告訴他，“明明眼藥水”治一切的眼病很靈騐，勸他到五洲藥房去買一瓶來用；果然一用之後，他的癢也止了，紅也消了，連他以前的眼病也都痊愈了。</p>
<p>現在再聽不见人说“他是紅眼睛”的这一句話。</p>

<p>電影</p>
<h3>國泰映「女醫生祕史」</h3>
<p>凱茀蘭茜絲傑作</p>
<p>一年以來，凱茀蘭茜絲主演的影片，在滬上公映的，已經有過「白衣觀音」和「斷腸雲雨」兩部。現在又有一部「女醫生秘史」Mary　Stevems　M.　D.。以女醫生爲題材的影片，以前好像很少見，就是這一部片子，雖然是以女醫生爲題材，但主要之點仍在戀愛。該片述一女醫生，對爲男女戀愛之事，初時看得十分透澈，熱心勸告别人，不要墜入情網，多找麻煩，但是後來她自己竟做了愛情的俘虜，所嘗的痛苦滋味，比别個女子還要利害，凱茀蘭茜絲演這種角色，當能勝任愉快，確與「白衣觀音」有異曲同工之妙，該片今日起在國泰大戲院公映。</p>
<h3>「永遠的微笑」公映</h3>
<p>「永遠的微笑」今日起在金城大戲院公映了，這是胡蝶的一九三六代表作。</p>
<p>它抒寫秦淮河邊一個歌女的聖潔的感情，她生活於一個陰暗醜惡而没有感情的環境裏，無處寄托她的苦悶的感情，但在一次的偶然中，她發現了一顆偉大的男性心靈，她就開始爲它而忍辱，犧牲，她倒傾了全部的感情，建造了她的安慰，但是殘酷的環境和冰冷的法律到底是不許她滿足，到底她是爲了那顆心靈而死亡了，但，她終於是滿足了，即使死，她是帶着一個美麗而快樂的微笑而死。</p>
<h3>維多麥克勞倫新片「鐵血俠骨」上映</h3>
<p>大明星維多麥克勞倫，自從在「革命叛徒」中演出後，因爲他那種率直的作風，引起觀衆們非常的擁護：並且他因爲那張片子，得了學院的金章褒奬。現在他又主演一張新片，片名「鐵血俠骨」，飾一個鐵錚錚的硬漢，忠肝義胆，柔腸俠骨，後來遇見了一個脂粉隊裏的尤物，變得神魂顛倒，一蹶不振，百折不磨壯士志，英雄難逃美人關，劇情之動人，較之「革命叛徒」有過之而無不及。該片今日起在南京大戲院公映，助演者有英國美麗明星琵麗彭絲及琪恩狄克蓀等。</p>

<h3>The Military Mobilization in Xi'an is Extremely Busy and Urgent</h3>
<p>Rumor has it that Mao Zedong has arrived in Xi'an; together with Yang Hucheng, he is inspecting troops in Weinan; traffic between Weinan and Chishui is cut off.</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Road News: Military mobilization in Xi'an is extremely busy and urgent. Residents are now prohibited from leaving the city, and all news from Tongguan to the west is completely cut off. Only Zhang Hongyan, who is temporarily stationed at the Xi'an Station in the Longhai Railway, can contact the road affairs in the Tongguan-Zhengzhou area via long-distance telephone. All other transportation lines are completely cut off. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Tongguan News: The attitudes of the Shaanxi generals Yang Hucheng are stubborn and they are actively preparing for war, in the hope that the Central Army will awaken. The Shaanxi situation, whether to resolve through war or peace, has reached a final critical juncture. The troops along the Longhai Line still maintain their original defenses, and all traffic is cut off. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Road News: Yang Hucheng is mobilizing troops, and preparations for war are very urgent. The Chishui Bridge on the Longhai Line was destroyed by Yang's troops. Both sides are still in a state of serious alert. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Xi'an is experiencing extreme shortages of food and fuel. Prices are soaring, and people are panicking. There is no will to fight. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Government is making every effort to be lenient in dealing with the Shaanxi situation. After Li Zhigang went to Shaanxi to convey the Central Government's wishes, Mi Chunlin arrived in Nanjing on the 13th. It is rumored that Mi will go to Shaanxi again within days to convey to Yang and others that they should comply with the Central Government's arrangements for the aftermath of the Shaanxi situation as soon as possible. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Road News: The bandit Mao Zedong has arrived in Xi'an, and the Communist Party and students warmly welcomed him. On the 12th, he went to Weinan with Yang Hucheng to inspect troops and summoned the generals at the front lines for a speech. The bandit Mao has a beard and hair more than a foot long and looks extremely strange. It is also reported that a portion of the bandit army has arrived in Xi'an and joined forces with Zhang and Yang's troops, wearing red armbands. The atmosphere within the city is filled with an ominous atmosphere. The Northeast Army has no courage to fight at all. Officers and soldiers are timid and extremely afraid of the power of the National Army. They are only being held hostage by left-leaning elements and Yang Hucheng. Sun Weiru is now also under Yang's surveillance, and his troops are now directly commanded by Yang. Yang's troops are also being mobilized to Chishui to take charge of the right-wing defense, while Zhang's troops are responsible for the front and the north bank of the Wei River. (14th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] It is rumored that the bandit Mao Zedong went to Weinan with Yang Hucheng on the 6th for a meeting, which did not end until late at night. Traffic between Weinan and Yishui was cut off starting on the 7th. On the 8th, the bandit Mao went to Pucheng, stayed for one day, and then went west. It is also rumored that Yu Xuezhong and Wang Yizhe arrived in Xi'an one after another and met with Yang Hucheng to discuss the current situation. Yang, seduced by the Red bandits, still stubbornly adheres to his views and insists on resisting to the end. The discussions between the two sides yielded no results, and the conflict of opinions has become even more severe. (14th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] According to information obtained here, Yang Hucheng recently sent personnel to the Lantian area to recruit scattered bandits, expanding his three garrison brigades and two special service regiments into divisions, calling himself the Eastern Route Army, and heading to the Weinan and Weibei areas to rush the construction of fortifications. (14th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu, Yang Hucheng is still acting perversely and has not yet awakened. Red propaganda is extremely rampant within Xi'an. The "Liberation Daily," run by people like Li Tiancai, is even more blatant in its support of the Red cause. Other newspapers are also prohibited from publishing news from the Central Government. All civilian radios that can receive reports from Nanjing are confiscated. The people are extremely panicked, especially merchants. The Xi'an radio broadcasting station is now also controlled by the Red Party, broadcasting reactionary propaganda every day. Yang Hucheng's troops and the Red bandits who have arrived around Xi'an are now taking advantage of the situation to loot and plunder, and robbery cases are repeatedly seen. Yang Hucheng is currently traveling between Sanyuan, Xi'an, and Lintong. Sun Weiru is in Xi'an, and a portion of Sun's troops is in Sanshui, moving east toward Xi'an. Among the Northeast Army in the Chishui area are a portion of the 57th Army under Miao Zhengliu and the 67th Army under Wang Yizhe.

<h3>People of Gansu Province Suffer Greatly from Bandit Disasters</h3>
<p>Representatives Arrive in Nanjing to Petition</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Shui Zi, the representative of the Gansu Bandit Disaster Relief Association, and Gao Wenwei, the chairman of the Provincial Relief Association, arrived in Nanjing and visited He Lian and Zhu Qinglan, among others. According to them, the counties of Wangning, Huanxian, Ningxian, Qingyang, and Heshui in eastern Gansu were occupied by the Red bandits Liu Zidan and others. Until last year, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and others led tens of thousands of troops to Gansu, passing through Minxian, Zhangxian, Weiyuan, Longxi, Wushan, and Gangu. Xu Donghai fled from southern Shaanxi, passing through Huixian, Chengxian, Liangdang, Kangxian, Xihe, Lixian, Tianshui, Qin'an, Qingshui, and Tongwei in southern Gansu, and joined forces with Mao, Peng, and others. Furthermore, passing through Zhuanglang, Jingde, Jingning, Huating, Pingliang, Zhenyuan, and Jingchuan in eastern Gansu, they joined forces with Liu Zidan, Yang Sen, and others who were entrenched in the counties of Qingyang, creating a large force that has been causing harm to this day. In August of last year, the bandit leaders Zhu De, Xu Xiangqian, Xun Ke, He Long, and others led all the bandits from Sichuan and Kang in separate directions to Gansu. Zhu and Xu's troops invaded Linhai, Zhangxian, Weiyuan, Lintao, Yuzhong, Kangle, Longxi, and Tongwei from Minxian. Xiao and He's troops invaded Tianshui, Xihe, Lixian, Huixian, Chengxian, Kangxian, and Liangdang in southern Gansu from Xigu, and then returned from Huicheng and other counties through Tianshui, Gangu, and Wushan to Longxi and Tongwei, joining forces with Zhu, Xu, and other bandits, cutting off the western section of the Longhai Railway, capturing Huining, besieging Dingxi, and attacking Jingyuan and Haiyuan. They also joined the forces entrenched in Haiyuan and eastern Gansu (Mao Zedong and Xu Donghai's troops) - one troop crossed the river from Jing'an (Zhu De, Xu Xiangqian, and other bandits) and invaded Jingtai and Yongdeng, capturing Gulang and attacking Wuwei Yongxiao, threatening to disturb the entire province of Gansu. Wherever the Communist bandits went, they either occupied and searched, or looted and tortured, digging three feet into the ground and burning everything to the ground. A large number of strong men and women were coerced. The people's stored grain, cattle, sheep, horses, and mules were almost completely plundered. The number of people who were brutally killed for resisting is even too terrible to describe. The losses suffered by the people can only be calculated by compiling the reports from each county regarding grain and livestock alone. Other losses of houses and property are even more difficult to enumerate. The people of Gansu rely entirely on farming and animal husbandry for a living. Now, the stored grain and livestock in various counties have been completely plundered by the Communist bandits. Not only is there no hope for the people's livelihood at present, but also this year's spring plowing has become a very serious problem. If the Central Government does not take remedial measures in advance, the survivors after the disaster will have no one left. We respectfully request the Central Government and our compatriots across the country to have pity and rescue us. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee previously designated Shi Weihuan, Chen Changheng, Liu Tong, and others to be responsible for drafting the Provisional Inheritance Tax Regulations. Shi and others invited Gao Bingfang, the Director of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, to a meeting at the Yuan on the morning of the 14th to exchange views on the drafting. There was no concrete conclusion yet, and further meetings are still needed for continued discussion. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has prepared a preliminary draft based on the inheritance tax principles set by the Central Political Committee and sent it to the committee for participation. The preliminary draft consists of seven chapters, including General Provisions, Taxation, Exemptions, Reporting, Investigation, and Evaluation Organizations, and Supplementary Provisions, totaling thirty articles. Most of the articles are based on the Provisional Income Tax Regulations. However, the tax rate issue is of utmost importance and has not yet been decided. Experts generally advocate that the inheritance tax should be levied on the total amount of the inherited property exceeding 5,000 yuan at a rate of 2%. For those whose total inherited property exceeds 50,000 yuan, an additional inheritance tax should be levied on the excess amount, with tax rates starting at 1% and reaching a maximum limit of 50% for the amount exceeding 15 million yuan. It is also heard that the Ministry of Finance has not yet expressed its opinion on whether these tax rate provisions are appropriate. It is hoped that people across the country will offer their valuable opinions for reference, so as to ensure fair legislation. (14th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Draft Regulations for the Appointment of Civil Servants by the Ministry of Personnel and the Ministry of Audit</h3>
<p>Time Limit for Submission and Salary Payment; Jointly Drafted Six Provisional Measures</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to Article 8 of the Civil Servant Appointment Law, the term of acting service shall not exceed three months. Currently, some acting personnel only submit the appointment review form and relevant supporting documents one or two months after acting, causing the review procedures to exceed the prescribed time limit upon completion. If there are unqualified personnel who have received salaries after the expiration date, the Ministry of Audit will deduct them according to law. However, disputes often arise during recovery. To remedy the above difficulties, the two ministries have jointly drafted six provisional measures for the time limit for submitting civil servant appointments for review and the payment of salaries. The measures have been approved by the Examination Yuan and will be implemented from January of the 26th year. The main points of the measures are as follows: If a candidate for a civil servant position is approved by the personnel agency within the statutory acting period, they will be paid according to the approved salary from the date of arrival of the agency's reply. Acting personnel are required to submit the appointment review and related supporting documents within 20 days from the start of the acting service. The competent authority should review and forward the documents to the personnel agency within 10 days after the acting personnel submit the documents. If the statutory acting period has expired but has not yet been approved, the salary may be borrowed by the competent officer at their discretion. After approval, the approved salary will be paid from the day following the expiration of the statutory acting period. Any overpayment will be returned. If the salary is changed due to a review, the salary will be paid according to the reviewed salary after the personnel agency's review decision. Those who are deemed unqualified after review, in addition to the statutory acting period, all salaries already paid will be recovered in full. However, this shall not apply to acting personnel and their competent authorities who have submitted the documents for review within the prescribed time limit.

<h3>Prospects for British Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>— Fortunately</p>
<p>Mr. Patrick, the representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department in China, arrived in Shanghai on the 11th of this month. We can get a glimpse of the mission of Mr. Patrick's visit from the talk given by Mr. Nixon, the General Manager of the British Export Credit Guarantee Department, when the news of the Sino-British credit loan of last October came out. At that time, Mr. Nixon denied the claim of a £10 million credit loan, but also said that the Bureau had assigned a representative to China to increase British export credit to China. In any case, it can be asserted that Mr. Patrick's visit will enhance Sino-British relations.</p>
<p>From the current British policy toward China, we have two understandings. First, British policy toward China is part of its general diplomatic policy of peace. Since Britain, the United States, and France established the World Monetary Agreement last September, they have not only avoided a vicious battle of currency devaluation in the development of the world economy, but also formed a strong united front among the world's three major democracies. So far, the cooperation of these three countries can be said to have become the focus of world peace. Maintaining world peace is the core of British diplomacy, and peace in the Far East cannot be separated from world peace. Britain's demand for stability in the Far East is, of course, very urgent. Second, the central principle of British policy toward China is based on realistic interests. In the Far East, Britain has larger financial interests than any other country, especially in southern China where many new investment interests have been added in recent years. In order to protect these realistic interests, Britain cannot sit idly by and ignore the political and economic difficulties of China.</p>
<p>Since China implemented the legal tender policy, Britain has established a cooperative foundation for Chinese finance by virtue of its strength in the Far East market. This spirit of cooperation has already achieved great success in Chinese economic construction and the Far East peace order. If Britain's export credit to China can be supplied in large quantities with Mr. Patrick's visit this time, then Chinese economic construction will become more and more advanced and the situation in the Far East will become more stable. This is to be expected.</p>
<h3>No German Troops in Morocco</h3>
<p>British Reporter's Investigation Results</p>
<p>[London] Today, the Daily Telegraph correspondent stationed in Ceuta, Spanish Morocco, spoke with Colonel Bepite of the Spanish National Army about the situation in North Africa. Colonel Bepite solemnly declared that no matter what the outcome of the Spanish Civil War, General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the National Army, will never cede Spanish territory to other countries or violate the Morocco Treaty. Franco has not allowed German troops to land in Spanish Morocco. German assistance to the National Army is all channeled through the three ports of Vigo, Cadiz, and Seville in mainland Spain. My relationship with the German authorities in Morocco is very good. What is even more satisfying is that I have invited Britain to send warships to Ceuta so that the British naval commander can investigate the truth on the ground. The British naval authorities have accepted this invitation. The correspondent also said that he had inspected western Spanish Morocco in one day and did not see any German troops or any signs of other foreign forces invading. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

<h3>German Aviation Minister Goering Visits Mussolini</h3>
<p>To Promote Further Cooperation Between Germany and Italy; Plans to Lease Italian Island to Open Aviation Line</p>
<p>[Rome] German Aviation Minister Goering today first paid respects to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the European War and the Tombs of the Fascist Martyrs. Then he went to the Royal Palace to meet King Victor Emmanuel III. The Queen received his wife. At 1:30 pm, Goering and German Ambassador to Italy Hassel visited Prime Minister Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia and held their first talks, which lasted a short time before they left. They are scheduled to continue their long talks at 5 pm. Political circles have not announced anything about the talks. All newspapers have praised Goering. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Rome] German Aviation Minister Goering departed from Berlin today to visit Italy. When he arrived at the Brenner Pass on the Italian border, he was welcomed by local senior officials. Goering and his party then continued on their way, passing through Florence, where they were welcomed by many local German expatriates. At 10:35 pm, he arrived in Rome. The station was decorated with lights and banners, which was very beautiful. Prime Minister Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano and his wife, and high-ranking officials were all waiting at the station. After getting off the train, Goering and Ciano rode in the same car and left the station. Then, a car followed, in which Goering's entourage and Mrs. Ciano rode together. The crowd cheered wildly when they saw it. Prime Minister Mussolini waited for Goering and others to leave the station before returning to the office with a secretary of the Fascist Party. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Rome] General Goering visited Mussolini this morning. In addition to discussing the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Gentleman's Agreement and the Spanish Civil War, they also discussed the Dodecanese Islands (belonging to Italy, located in the Mediterranean Sea between Asia Minor and Greece). When Italian Undersecretary of Aviation Fari visited Germany last summer, he negotiated an agreement: If Germany wants to open an aviation route to the East, Italy will allow Germany to choose a site in the archipelago to build an airfield. During today's meeting with Mussolini, Goering probably mentioned that Germany's aviation plan has matured and asked for the lease of a smaller, uninhabited island in the archipelago to Germany. However, because this matter may affect the status quo in the Mediterranean, Mussolini must have expressed to Goering the intricate relations in the agreement signed with Britain to maintain the status quo. At the same time, Mussolini must have reiterated that the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement will not weaken Italian-German relations, and that the cooperation between the two countries will continue.

<h3>Difficult to Achieve German-French Economic Negotiations for the Time Being</h3>
<p>Schacht Will Not Go to Paris for Now; German Reaction to Eden's Speech</p>
<p>[Berlin] Foreign news reports that the President of the Deutsche Bank, Schacht, will visit Paris are groundless. Schacht himself stated that he is too busy with official duties and cannot leave Berlin at present. (13th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] The French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, had a long conversation with the Minister of Commerce, Bastid, and the Director of the Commercial Treaty Department, Alphand, at the Ministry of Commerce tonight. According to reliable sources, this conversation was a preparation for the commencement of German-French economic negotiations. (13th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] The German pavilion at the Paris International Exposition will soon begin construction, with the groundbreaking ceremony to be held on the 16th of this month. Yesterday's newspapers reported that the German Minister of Economic Affairs and President of the Central Bank, Schacht, would come to Paris to personally preside over the groundbreaking ceremony. However, today the German semi-official news agency, Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur, issued a message denying this, saying that Schacht would not come to Paris on the 16th. Responsible individuals here do not view this denial as unusual. On the contrary, they are quite surprised by yesterday's reports that Schacht will come to Paris within days, as official reports received in recent days have made no mention of Schacht's imminent arrival in France. It is understood that although the new French-German commercial treaty is currently under negotiation, observers believe that more general economic talks between France and Germany will have to be postponed to a later date. Therefore, there is no need for Schacht to come to France at present. (13th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] Newspapers recently reported that Prime Minister Léon Blum is scheduled to deliver an important speech in Lyon on the 24th of this month, declaring that France and Germany should engage in extensive negotiations on economic and financial matters, without imposing any political preconditions. In this regard, the L'Entreprise newspaper stated, "France and Germany should find a way to establish understanding in economic and political terms, and then discuss political conditions." Le Journal stated, "Based on past experience, we have always granted benefits to Germany with conditions attached, but these conditions ultimately proved ineffective." (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Rome] Yesterday, it was widely rumored that the German Minister of Economic Affairs and President of the Central Bank, Schacht, would visit Paris within days. This rumor was subsequently denied by the German News Agency. Before the denial was issued, the Roma Tribune published an article hoping that Britain would also participate in the economic talks between France and Germany, and that future talks between Britain, France, and Germany in Paris would be expanded to include Italy, so that the four major European powers could jointly negotiate. (13th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German government and the public warmly welcomed the speech delivered by the British Foreign Secretary Eden last night at the Foreign Press Association. Eden's expression of his desire to maintain friendship and cooperation is fully in line with Germany's efforts to maintain cooperation and friendly relations with peace-loving countries, especially Britain. Regarding the elimination of obstacles to international trade, Germany has been working towards this goal for many years, in line with Britain's wishes. However, there is no doubt that the current economic situation is still severe, and this cannot be ignored. Eden's declaration that war leads to disaster is also in line with the basic principles of Hitler's policies. Germany also sympathizes with the view that expanding armaments cannot bring happiness and prosperity to the country. The German Chancellor has repeatedly put forward practical proposals to reduce armaments, but unfortunately, they have all been ignored. Therefore, Germany, like Britain, has no choice but to maintain equality in armaments in order to safeguard its own security. (13th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech at a dinner for foreign journalists last night, saying that between butter and cannons, he would rather sacrifice cannons for butter. Upon hearing this, the German newspapers expressed outrage, saying, "Germany is under the threat of great powers." Germans are tightening their belts and reorganizing their armaments. The Foreign Secretary Eden failed to see this. The Börsen-Zeitung, the mouthpiece of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated, "The words of the Foreign Secretary Eden are not pertinent. Britain has never experienced the pain of the Treaty of Versailles. Butter and cannons are available at will." The semi-official newspaper Politisch-Diplomatische Korrespondenz stated, "The rich do not know the difficulties of the poor." (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Issue of Prohibiting Volunteers from Going to Spain</h3>
<p>Portugal Agrees in Principle with Britain; French Cabinet Plans to Issue Legal Decree; US Advises People Not to Go to Spain</p>
<p>Lisbon, Portugal Regarding the issue of prohibiting volunteers from enlisting in Spain, after the British government made a new proposal to the five countries of France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Portugal, the Portuguese Foreign Minister Salazar submitted a reply to the British Ambassador, Sir Walford Selby, yesterday, expressing acceptance in principle, stating, "The government of this country will submit a bill to the parliament to prohibit the recruitment of volunteers and the passage of volunteers through the country's borders. The strictness of the measures will be the same as those established by other related countries. We are now awaiting the governments of the related countries to stipulate the measures, so that we can follow suit and implement them on the same day. The scope should not be limited to the nationals of the related countries, but also to foreigners within and outside the borders of those countries, whether they are going to Spain or leaving Spain, should be prohibited equally. This is what the government of this country considers necessary." (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Diplomatic circles are unwilling to disclose anything about the Portuguese reply, only saying that it is satisfactory and very helpful to the ongoing negotiations. Although the replies from Germany and Italy have not yet been received, it is generally speculated that their attitude will be similar to that of Portugal. (13th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] After the Cabinet held a state council this morning, Foreign Minister Delbos revealed the news that the Cabinet will submit a draft law to the Chamber of Deputies at 5:00 PM, requesting that the government be granted the necessary powers to take appropriate action on the issue of prohibiting volunteers from enlisting in Spain within six months, and will request the Chamber of Deputies to submit it for discussion immediately. As for the activities of Germany in Spanish Morocco, after the German Führer Hitler and the French Ambassador to Germany François-Poncet provided mutual assurances and issued a joint statement, this issue has been declared resolved. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Cabinet held a state council this morning, during which the agenda of the Chamber of Deputies was discussed, and Foreign Minister Delbos read out the proposed draft law, advocating that the Chamber of Deputies should grant the government the necessary powers to issue legal decrees at any time to prohibit volunteers from going to Spain. This draft law will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion this afternoon. It is still uncertain whether the Chamber of Deputies will grant the government full powers. Political figures are deeply concerned that members of both the left and right extremes will resolutely oppose this bill, unless the governments of the countries concerned participate in the plan to monitor the land and sea borders of Spain in a unified manner. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Civil and Criminal Law Committee of the Chamber of Deputies has decided to suspend the review of a bill proposed by a member of parliament to curb French citizens from enlisting in volunteer corps in Spain. The committee made this decision because the government itself will submit a bill with the same purpose. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Acting Secretary of State Moore recently received a report that 76 Americans had arrived in the port of Barcelona, Spain, preparing to join the government forces of that country to fight. He then instructed the consul in the port of Barcelona to advise these people not to participate in the civil war, and to inform them that according to the law of 1909, Americans who are recruited domestically to go abroad to participate in war may be sentenced to three years of imprisonment and a fine of one thousand US dollars. Well-informed sources believe that Americans who are recruited abroad and join the wars of other countries may not be bound by this law. (13th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Krupp Armaments Factory in Germany Profitable</h3>
<p>Rare Phenomenon in Twenty Years; Reflection of Global Arms Race</p>
<p>[Berlin] It has been heard that Krupp Steel Company shareholders can be paid a dividend of 4%, a phenomenon that has not occurred in the company for twenty years. The company's total capital is 160 million marks. The total profit for the fiscal year 1934-1935 was 9.7 million marks, and for the fiscal year 1935-1936, the profit was 14.4 million marks, accounting for 9% of the total capital. In addition to the 4% dividend paid to shareholders, the remaining 5%, or 8 million marks, is used as a reserve fund.

He then met with Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pacelli and Bishop Mariani. (13th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Madrid In the outskirts of the capital, thick fog has covered the sky in recent days. Both sides have stopped artillery fire. Only a few artillery sounds were heard around 3:00 PM today. Although the situation on the outskirts of the capital is very quiet at present, it cannot be assumed that military operations have ceased. The offensive adopted by the National Army is very serious and will not be interrupted. The government forces have also prepared to launch a counterattack. Judging from the situation in the past few days, the government forces have become more agile in combat than before. Their militia has also become experienced, and they can take advantage of the terrain to attack and defend, no less capable than the formal army. Looking at the siege of the capital, which has lasted for two months, it has not been captured. The defenders deeply know that they have a major historical mission, so they all fight bravely and do not give in, comparing favorably with the defenders of the Verdun fortress during the European War. This reporter asked General Miaja, Chairman of the Defense Committee, about the situation of the war. Although he did not want to disclose anything, he had a smile on his face, which shows his optimism. (13th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Today, the world is using illegal competition in commerce, and most countries decorated with suspicion are taking coercive measures, failing to consider the interests of each other in the future, and the path forever. However, the US government is avoiding this kind of trade policy. We not only dare to assert this, but also must work hard to hope that other countries will hold the same view. We are here this time as a private organization, not representing the government, but it is recognized by the government's understanding. We are not here to express dissatisfaction with Japan. Our goal is to explain all misunderstandings between Japan and the United States in the future, and to avoid things that are unfavorable to both countries. This is our goal.

<h3>Closing of the Third Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Budget Passed</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union has approved all resolutions passed by the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee during the second and third sessions and the standing committee period. The session was adjourned after a speech by Bettolovsky. (TASS telegram of the 13th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union today unanimously approved the 1937 national budget, with an estimated revenue of 98,069,500,000 rubles and an expenditure of 97,119,500,000 rubles. (TASS telegram of the 13th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] An editorial in Pravda stated, "The socialist national budget is a vivid reflection of the economic and cultural development of our motherland. When the First Five-Year Plan was completed, the total national budget revenue was 30.6 billion rubles. This year's budget revenue has reached 97.8 billion rubles, an increase of 17.3% over 1936. The basis for the increase in revenue lies in a 20% increase in industrial production, a 16.6% increase in railway freight revenue, a 23.6% increase in retail trade, and the commencement of work by numerous new enterprises. In the 1937 budget revenue, income from production and commodity circulation will reach 76.7 billion rubles, an increase of 16.5% over last year.</p>
<p>The newspaper also stated, "A characteristic feature of the budget expenditure is the increased funding for strengthening the Red Army and acquiring superior military equipment. This has been unanimously agreed upon by the whole country as the most reliable way to safeguard peace and the most reliable guarantee for the further victory of the laboring class and culture. The vast amount of funding for education, health, and cultural construction in the budget is particularly noteworthy. This year, education expenditure has increased from 13.9 billion to 18.5 billion rubles, and expenditure on schools, kindergartens, and nurseries has increased by 36.2%. Subsidies for mothers with multiple children, childcare centers, maternity hospitals, milk distribution centers, infant homes, and other construction and maintenance costs have increased from 1.8 billion to 3.2 billion rubles. In addition to the sharp increase in the national budget, the budgets of various republics and local governments have also increased significantly, especially in the newly established federal republics. The budget of the Kyrgyz Republic has almost increased by 69%, Kazakhstan by nearly 46%, Armenia by 31%, and Azerbaijan by 26%. This shows that the Leninist-Stalinist party's ethnic policies have helped previously backward ethnic groups achieve the status of advanced ethnic groups in terms of economy and culture."

<h3>Case of Japanese Secret Service Agency in Zhengzhou Conspiring to Harm Our Country</h3>
<p>Commissioner's Office Releases a Portion of the Documents - Utilizing Bandit Uprisings and Investigating Traitors</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Correspondence The Japanese Garrison in North China dispatched Shiga Hideji, Yamaguchi Isao, Tanaka Norio, etc., to Zhengzhou last summer to engage in espionage. They established a secret service agency in the backyard of Baihua Silver Shop on Datong Road under the guise of the "Cultural Research Institute." For several months, through the secret activities of the agency chief Shiga, they bribed traitors and spied on military and political situations. (The District Administrative Commissioner's Office and the Public Security Bureau had long been aware of the agency's activities in Zhengzhou. However, because they were Japanese residents living here, the authorities, in addition to providing protection, were not convenient to take any action. Recently, a traitor named Zhao Longtian, also known as Zhao Yumen, was dispatched by the agency to Xi'an to investigate military and political news. He was investigated and proven by the Xi'an authorities and arrested and dealt with according to law. Later, he was released due to the Xi'an Incident. On the evening of January 2nd, at 10 pm, he returned to Zhengzhou from Shaanxi and stayed in the secret service agency. Our side had already detected Zhao Longtian's illegal activities, but because he lived in seclusion, it was impossible to thoroughly investigate. It was delayed until about 9 pm on the 4th of this month, when Zhao Longtian and Yamaguchi accompanied a companion to Tianjin to meet with a staff officer Zhang of Liu Guitang, intending to recruit more than a thousand remnants of Liu's bandits in Yuxian County, western Henan, in an attempt to riot. However, because the area near the agency was densely guarded by our personnel, they did not dare to go out. Instead, they jumped out of the back wall and landed in the courtyard of the Chamber of Commerce Fire Brigade. Yamaguchi and Zhao Longtian were about to flee when they were captured by Public Security Bureau police officer Jin Guoding. He immediately telephoned Public Security Bureau Chief Chuan Liangbi, who dispatched the bureau's detective team leader Chen Boting to take the case for interrogation. According to Zhao Longtian's confession, he admitted to being bought by the Japanese to work as a traitor. After the bureau recorded the confession, considering that the case involved foreign affairs and included a Japanese person, Yamaguchi, they handed it over to Li Shenhai, adjutant of the Provisional Office of the First District Commissioner's Office, for delivery to the Commissioner's Office. Commissioner Ruan personally interrogated Zhao Longtian after receiving the report that night. According to the confession, he was 36 years old, from Shen County, Shandong (note: there is no such county in Shandong; Shen County in northern Henan is also different from this Shen character). His family includes his father, brothers, sisters-in-law, and wife. He studied from a young age and graduated from Tianjin Police Academy (note: there is no police academy in Tianjin). In the 16th year of the Republic of China, he worked in the military. In the 22nd year, he served as a police chief. Last September, he was hired by the Japanese through Zhang Jin to investigate the local military and political situation in Shaanxi. After returning to Zhengzhou, he reported that Chairman Shao advocated overthrowing Japan at a meeting in Xi'an. He did not report anything else, nor did he do anything with him. This time, he gave me fifty yuan, which is true. I heard the Japanese say that there is a person surnamed □, who is a Japanese student, and another surnamed □. □ lives in □□ for a long time, while □ does not know. I also heard the Japanese say that □'s work performance in □□ is better than others. □ does not know if he works for you. □ constantly travels back and forth to Zhengzhou and often stays at the Wuzhou Hotel. The Japanese said that there are more than a thousand bandits in Yuxian County, and they asked Liu Guitang's staff officer to come and discuss further. They are preparing to open a rubber factory in Zhengzhou in the next few days, first inviting about a hundred Koreans to Zhengzhou to set up an agency to sell opium and create chaos in Zhengzhou. When Liu Guitang's staff officer Zhang arrives, there will be a solution. He also knows that there is a Tianjin person □□□, and another □□□, whose alias is □□□. He often lives in Tianjin and works. Both of them have been to Zhengzhou. In the Japanese's house, there is a cook, a child, and Yamaguchi's wife. This time I went to Shiga's place, and he wouldn't let me leave. He wanted me to jump over the wall, so I was captured by the detectives." After Commissioner Ruan recorded the confession, considering that Shiga and others had established a secret service agency in Zhengzhou under the guise of the "Cultural Research Institute," with the personal confession of the traitor Zhao Longtian as evidence, he was well aware of Shiga's secret activities in Zhengzhou, colluding with bandits, attempting to riot, and sabotaging transportation and hijacking express trains. Therefore, at 9 am on the 5th, Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau Chief Fu Liangbi led police officers and Zhang Wanli, Japanese secretary of the Commissioner's Office, to the Japanese secret service agency in Tongshang Lane and notified Sasaki, the Japanese Consul stationed in Zhengzhou, by telephone. After the consulate received our notification, it immediately notified Shiga to prepare. As a result, the agency closed its doors tightly and burned various secret documents. After our inspection personnel arranged their positions and rang the doorbell, the agency's doorman child originally intended to open the door immediately, but the Japanese used guns to threaten him not to open the door and stood in front of the door. The inspection personnel, seeing that the door was tightly closed, were deeply afraid of changes, so they broke down the door and entered the courtyard. Tanaka came downstairs, and Shiga prepared a pistol upstairs to resist. Secretary Zhang negotiated with him for inspection, but it was ineffective. Bureau Chief Chuan ordered his detective team leader Chen Boting, accompanied by a detective, to go upstairs with Tanaka and begin the inspection. Shiga, in a hurry, burned the documents he had prepared to take away with coal fire and also sent his attendant to burn all the secret documents in the toilet at the same time. After our discovery, the police went to the toilet to put out the fire. Shiga, Tanaka, and all the unburned documents upstairs were taken back to the First District Administrative Commissioner's Office, along with the traitor Zhao Longtian and the Japanese Yamaguchi, Tanaka, and Shiga, who were captured on the 4th. The five people were placed under guard in a separate room in the Commissioner's Office. Sasaki, the Japanese Consul stationed in Zhengzhou, visited Commissioner Ruan at the Commissioner's Office at 12 pm on the 6th for this case, accompanied by Sada Hirai, a secretary dispatched from the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, expressing apologies for Shiga and others' establishment of a secret agency and activities in Zhengzhou, and requesting the extradition of the detained Shiga, Yamaguchi, and Tanaka. Commissioner Ruan agreed to issue a formal extradition document and notified the Japanese Consulate to deport the three people. However, after the Japanese Consulate extradited Shiga and others from the Commissioner's Office, they are still residing in their consulate. Yamaguchi's wife also moved to the consulate after the inspection. Considering that this case involves foreign affairs, the Commissioner's Office, in addition to sending personnel to sort out the various secret documents obtained, reported the details of the case to Chairman Chiang, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Provincial Government, and the Pacification Headquarters. It is learned that the Commissioner's Office has received a reply telegram from Chairman Chiang, instructing on the handling method, and a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting the prompt submission of evidence copies for negotiations with the Japanese Embassy. Consul Sasaki telegraphed the Japanese Embassy in China in Nanjing on the night of the 5th after the case occurred, reporting the details of the case. Sada, a secretary stationed here by the embassy, urgently telegraphed Nanjing to report to the embassy on the morning of the 6th and dispatched Secretary Yatsuya Minoru from Shanghai to Zhengzhou on the morning of the 8th to conduct an on-site investigation. After Yatsuya Minoru arrived in Zhengzhou, he went to the Japanese Consulate to listen to the report of Consul Sasaki. The Japanese Garrison in Tianjin also dispatched Shimada Jiro, who had another mission in Lanfeng, to Zhengzhou on the night of the 7th to investigate at the Japanese Consulate. He has now completed his mission and returned to Lanfeng on the 8th.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Shiga and others, dispatched by the Japanese Garrison in North China, came to Zhengzhou to set up a secret service agency in the backyard of Baihua Silver Shop on Tongshang Lane, Datong Road. According to investigations, this house originally belonged to Zhang Xiaoxuan, but due to debt relations, it was pledged to a Mr. Li in Beiping. Mr. Li sold drugs with Japanese ronin Ogata in Tianjin last year and transported them to Zhengzhou. After being seized by the police, Mr. Li, unable to bear the losses, transferred the house in Tongshang Lane to Ogata. When Shiga and others came to Zhengzhou to set up the agency, they rented it from Ogata. Originally, Zhang Xiaoxuan advocated selling it to Mr. Li for 5,000 yuan after Shiga and others rented the house to pay off his debt. Mr. Li discussed it with Ogata, who only wanted to offer 1,000 yuan, so it has been delayed until now and has not been resolved. Since the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau solved this case, it has been sealed off and police have been assigned to guard the house. No one is allowed to enter. It is currently awaiting instructions from higher authorities.</p>
<p>It is also reported that after the Japanese secret service agency in Zhengzhou was seized by us, Zhang Qianmin, a traitor who came from Tianjin to Zhengzhou to receive a 100 yuan travel expense from the Japanese side to carry out activities in □□, was also captured. He is currently being detained in the Commissioner's Office for interrogation. However, whether Zhang is the staff officer of Liu Guitang's bandit gang has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>The translated text of the important documents copied by the Commissioner's Office is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Skillfully manipulate Koreans in Qiaojin or make them go deep into Henan to sell ordinary commodities or various drugs, and give convenience or lend capital travel expenses to core Korean or Japanese personnel, or provide commodities without revealing the power of this agency behind them. On the one hand, publicize that this kind of behavior is very profitable in Henan, so that the Chinese authorities shift their attention and no longer pay attention to this agency. If there are improper arrests, immediately request extradition and propose aircraft to escort the prisoner for negotiation, and on the other hand, make other demands and invest some expenses to buy off the Chinese authorities. After air transportation is implemented, this agency will become the agency of the airline company.</p>
<p>(B) The Chinese authorities' surveillance and oppression of Zhengzhou are extremely serious, and it is simply impossible to carry out activities. As reported before, espionage and investigation must use Chinese personnel. Since the liaison officer of Guan Wu Guan was killed, the lives of Chinese people are also very dangerous, so the treatment must not be the same as in Tianjin. Zhang Mu, recommended by Bao Guancheng, brought him with him when he took office, but he was frightened by the Public Security Bureau and ordered to leave Zhengzhou. He was forced to be sent to Kaifeng, and then returned to Tianjin. It is planned to order Zhang and Bao's secretary-general Zheng (a Henan native who once served as the secretary-general of the Harbin Municipal Government) to organize a small newspaper in Zhengzhou, and try to run it on a small scale for two or three months to observe the effect. The start-up cost is about 500 yuan, and a monthly subsidy of 200 yuan is enough to run it. Please consider and approve. Although the Zhengzhou agency has a monthly intelligence fee of 300 yuan, the Chinese personnel used are not fixed (odd jobs cannot be compared), and the local situation is as mentioned above. The amount is not sufficient for liaison with local bandits and militias, and various investigations, etc. Please understand and find a way to solve it.</p>
<p>(C) (Leaking confidential matters) This agency has agreed with the consulate to use the name of the Cultural Research Institute externally, which is very secretive. Today, Mr. Masuda, a Chinese researcher stationed in Zhengzhou, met with Secretary Zhang of the First District Commissioner's Office. Zhang said that regarding the Cultural Research Institute, he was ordered to inquire at the consulate beforehand. According to Hirayama Yu, the police chief in charge, the institute is actually a secret service agency sent to Zhengzhou by the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin. The Major immediately informed this agency of this purpose. According to various circumstances, it is suspected that the police department of the consulate leaked secrets. This report can confirm it. Furthermore, Hirayama Yu hopes to be transferred (especially wants to be sent to Yantai). He returned to his country with his family luggage a few days ago. The above situation should be notified to Sasaki Takayoshi, the consul stationed in Zhengzhou. Although the Chinese side already knows that this agency is a military agency, there is currently no intention to request its withdrawal. However, he once said to Masuda that in principle, the treaty port only welcomes the residence of merchants and cannot allow the existence of military and political agencies. Remaining crimes (this should refer to Hirayama), the Mogi incident, the Dazhong Weekly, the Wang Nu incident, the Hankou Zhengzhou debt not repaid, the influence of the above-mentioned matters passing through Xuzhou (incomplete).</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Investigating and Pursuing Robbing Fishermen</p>
<p>Fisherman Zheng from Zhejiang, carrying 25 loads of crucian carp, set off on the 10th to deliver them to the Shanghai fish market. At about 1 am that night, when passing the Longwang Temple area of Henglu Jing in Jinshan County, he was stopped by a bandit ship. Four bandits jumped out and boarded the ship, driving Zheng and his crew into a corner and robbing all the crucian carp they were carrying, loading them onto the bandit ship and sailing away. After the fisherman reported to the First District Department of the Minhang Water Police, Detective Chen was dispatched to investigate. Detective Chen came to Songjiang yesterday to meet with Fei Gongxia, captain of the water patrol team, and found that a certain fish shop in the city had purchased five loads of dead crucian carp. At the same time, another fishing boat came to peddle fish, but because the price was not right, it sailed to Punan. Captain Fei and others, after receiving the news, have already gone to Punan to investigate and pursue.</p>
<p>Jail Officer Found Guilty of Dereliction of Duty Hou Qixiang, the former prison officer of Muxian County, was ordered by the province to be dismissed and investigated due to repeated major prison escape cases during his tenure.

<h3>Famous Malayan Inside Defender Wang Kehou Joins Tung Wah</h3>
<p>To Play Western Merchants at the City Stadium the Day After Tomorrow. This Week's Western Football League Referee Assignments Set</p>
<p>The Western Football League has a total of thirteen games scheduled for the next two days. In the First Division, Jinan and Socal have a bye. There are five games competing tomorrow, Saturday. The day after tomorrow, Sunday, Tung Wah meets Western Merchants at the City Stadium in a plain and unremarkable match that is difficult to attract spectators. St. Francis versus Royal Engineers at the Racecourse is a tense situation, although victory will ultimately go to Royal Engineers. However, St. Francis should have excellent offense and defense to contend with the British troops, which can be predicted from their performance against Lax last week. Tomorrow, Lax will play against French Merchants. The Lax team has practiced twice in the past two days, preparing to go all out to resist. Their famous left winger, Boussely, is scheduled to return to Shanghai today, but it is not yet known whether he will be able to play tomorrow. If he can help, then the Lax team's strength will be even more formidable, allowing them to put up a strong fight against French Merchants. Western Ports versus Portuguese is an evenly matched contest, and the outcome is difficult to predict. The League is taking it seriously and has specially designated linesmen. Tomorrow, the Measurement and Yuyou teams in the Second Division will face each other in the final week of the Zilin Cup, which can also be used to predict who will be the champion. All other games are uninteresting. As for the lineup of Tung Wah versus Western Merchants, it has not yet been arranged. What is worth mentioning is the addition of the newly acquired Malayan star Wang Kehou. Wang is a skilled left defender. Last year, when the World Games team went south, Wang represented the Java team and played against the World Games team, giving an excellent performance. This time, through Li Ning's introduction, he joined Tung Wah, replacing Li's position. He will make his debut in the city center the day after tomorrow. From then on, Tung Wah's problem of lacking inside defenders can be solved satisfactorily. The referees for each game this week have been assigned as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday's two Western Youth Basketball games were both makeup games. Fudan versus Tongji took the stage first at 8 PM. Tongji had a strong momentum, with Luo Guangkai and Chen Bangben scoring four goals first, leading 8 to 0. The audience was excited. Fudan worked hard to advance, relying on two throws by Zhou Qiu to get four points. But Tongji's Luo Guangkai scored again, until Chuan Qiu Weng succeeded, then they chased to 10 points each. Tongji then added three points, still leading 13 to 10. But then they lost all momentum, and Fudan scored six goals in a row, leading 22 to 13. After the restart, Tongji scored two more goals, once chasing to 17 to 22. But then it became Fudan's world again, ending the game 48 to 18. Fudan also won. The next game was Chih Chih versus St. John. Initially, Chih Chih was strong, and the whole game was one-sided. After ten minutes, it gradually became more balanced. The first half ended 29 to 16, with Chih Chih in the lead. The second half was even closer. As a result, Chih Chih scored 24, and St. John scored 22, only one goal behind. Chih Chih won 53 to 38 due to the sufficient capital in the first half. Currently, Independent and University Groups each have five games to be played. The final rankings will likely be stable. According to this week's situation, the final outcome can be observed. Today's one game is not very exciting.</p>

He departed from Genoa on December 22nd of last year, accompanied by Mr. Zeng Zhongming and Mr. Chen Yaozu, on the Norddeutscher Lloyd ship "Berlin" to return to the country. He passed through Hong Kong on the 12th. The Central Government specially dispatched Central Committee members Shao Lizi, Zhou Qigang, and Zhou Fo-hai to Hong Kong to welcome him. They arrived in Shanghai together yesterday afternoon. The details are shared as follows:</p>
<p>Welcome from All Sides</p>

He spoke eloquently when meeting with the welcoming personnel on the ship, showing no signs of fatigue. Later, as there were other relatives and friends welcoming him at various wharves, he sent Director of the Foreign Affairs Ministry's Shanghai Office Zhou Jue and Section Chief of the Municipal Government Li Dachao to Gonghexiang Wharf, Xinguang Wharf, and Jinliyuan Wharf, etc., on his behalf to thank the welcoming personnel for their grand welcome.

As for the location of the meeting with President Chiang, whether it will be in Nanjing or Fenghua, has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Written Remarks</p>
<p>Chairman Wang published written remarks on the ship as follows: "Brothers, on December 22nd of last year, I published written remarks when disembarking in Genoa. On January 6th, I published written remarks again when passing through Singapore. On the 10th, I passed through Manila and handed these two written remarks to the press. The same was done when I passed through Hong Kong on the 12th. Now I am re-examining them for reference. As for other records, I have not reviewed them and cannot be responsible for them. There are many important domestic problems that need to be resolved urgently, but I do not wish to express opinions alone before discussing them in detail with my colleagues in the Central Government. I hope you will forgive me for this. Now I can only share with you my recent feelings. For several months in Europe, due to my illness, I did not have much contact with the government and people from all walks of life. However, as far as I have seen and heard, I feel that people from friendly countries are very sympathetic to the difficult situation in our country and have many expectations for our country's united efforts to seek survival and progress. This is very gratifying. When returning home by ship through Singapore, Manila, Hong Kong, and other places, meeting with overseas Chinese, and reading the newspapers sent from the country, my feelings were even deeper. I feel that in times of urgency, there is a unified understanding and a clear position within and without, from the central and local governments to all walks of life, and the feeling of shared destiny is natural and sincere. This is truly the Prime Minister's teaching of 'love and sincerity,' and the true expression of unity since the September 18th Incident. With this sincerity, our country can rely on seeking life from death and survival from extinction. Based on this sincerity, and fully leveraging it, there will be no barriers that cannot be eliminated and no suspicions that cannot be dispelled among all party comrades and all compatriots. I hope to work together to strive for daily progress. Finally, I have one more word. China's most urgent task today is to save the nation, and saving the nation depends on the strength of the people. The increase in the strength of the people is the increase in the power to save the nation, which must be cultivated with care. The method of cultivation lies in spiritual tempering, and material supply is equally important. The weakness of China's national power is due to the exhaustion of people's livelihood, so improving the living conditions and alleviating the suffering of the general public is saving the people and saving the country. This is what I hope to regard as one thing and work together to achieve." (Remarks in Genoa) The remarks made on December 22nd of the 25th year when disembarking in Genoa said, "For several years, China has been struggling to support itself under the heavy pressure of internal and external troubles, striving for united solidarity and preparing for the final sacrifice. Day by day, progress has been made. The recent defense of Suiyuan against the invaders is a sign of progress. Just when we were working together to seek thoroughness, the Xi'an Incident suddenly occurred, undermining the country's discipline and disrupting the military's discipline. This gradual progress will be devastated, and internal and external troubles will fall into confusion. To talk about resisting insults at this time is truly going south by driving the chariot north. All the central government's resolutions on this incident have shown our goal of effort. China's struggle depends on the leadership of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. We must strive to restore his safety and freedom. I have been ill for several months and have been recuperating in Europe. I had already decided to return to the country in the near future. Since hearing about the Xi'an Incident, I have been particularly heartbroken. The central government has repeatedly sent telegrams urging me to return, so I set off for home today. In the future, I will work together with my comrades to reverse this critical situation." (Remarks passing through Singapore) The remarks made on January 6th when passing through Singapore were roughly as follows: "I have been granted leave by the central government to recuperate from illness. For several months, I have gradually recovered. It was originally scheduled to take a boat back to the country in mid-November of last year, but my gallbladder inflammation suddenly broke out, which led to the postponement. In mid-December, I heard about the Xi'an Incident, and I was very anxious. So I disembarked on the 22nd. On the 26th, I received a telegram from Mr. Chiang safely arriving in the capital, and I was relieved. Regarding the policy of saving the country and seeking survival, the central government has a whole plan and a certain procedure. Since Mr. Chiang has been in charge of administration, the central government has been strengthened, national power has increased, and diplomatic responses have been very appropriate. We can only unite as a country and follow this effort. As for other questions, I plan to wait until I arrive in Nanjing to discuss them in detail with my comrades. I have no opinion to express at this time. Finally, regarding the case of the assassination attempt on me, I would like to say a word. Previously, because the matter was related to the judiciary and was in the process of trial, I did not want to speak. Recently, I heard that the case has been judged. I think that in my life, I have no private hatred, and in recent years, I have been in charge of administration, at a time when internal and external troubles are pressing. Although I have exhausted my efforts, the hardships and setbacks are unknown to outsiders. If there is a misunderstanding that leads to violent acts, it is forgivable. After returning to Nanjing, I plan to ask the National Government to generously pardon all the linked criminals."</p>
<p>Thanking All Circles</p>
<p>Wang also issued an announcement last night saying, "Wang Zhaoming respectfully thanks all circles." "This afternoon, I arrived in Shanghai, and I am deeply grateful for the kindness of representatives from all circles, the general public, all comrades, and all relatives and friends who have condescended to welcome me. Because I did not know in advance, I left the ship from Wusong and could not personally go to the wharf to meet with everyone, which I deeply regret. I hereby express my thanks and hope that everyone will understand and forgive me. Wang Zhaoming respectfully announces."</p>

<h3>Income Tax to be Implemented as Scheduled; Issuance of Notices for Categories One and Three Collection</h3>
<p>Businesses Can Send Letters to Request Copies</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Finance's collection of income tax will be fully implemented this year. Various businesses are following the procedures, and many have been going to the Income Tax Office to inquire about the collection methods in recent days. The office has prepared explanatory materials for distribution. The two types of collection notices for the first and third categories of income tax have been approved and printed by Minister Kong. Businesses can send letters to request copies. The second category is still being drafted. Regarding the third category of income tax on interest from deposits, the banking industry has discussed the procedures and submitted a written opinion for the Ministry of Finance's reference. On the 14th at noon, representatives were sent to visit Liang Jingchun, the deputy director of the office, to discuss the matter. According to Mr. Liang's remarks to reporters, the banking industry is ready to implement the tax on schedule. For those who, due to business customs, need to close their accounts by February 10th, the Ministry of Finance has issued an order exempting them from taxation before the closing period. As for reports that 1% of the income will be used as a handling fee for collection or returned to depositors as a preferential treatment, Mr. Liang stated that this is not accurate. Mr. Liang then presented two copies of the collection notices, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>Category One Tax Collection Notice: 1. Regarding Article 5 of the Implementation Rules, which refers to branches operating abroad while the head office is in China, this refers to branches whose entire operations are abroad. If a branch operates partly abroad, the profits from its operations abroad should be excluded when calculating the head office's net profit. 2. Regarding Article 6 of the Implementation Rules, which refers to the capital of the head office and its branches being divided, this refers to the capital and operations of the branches being completely independent. 3. If there is an increase or decrease in the capital of a for-profit enterprise, it should be reported to the local competent tax collection authority within 15 days from the date of the increase or decrease. 4. The capital mentioned in Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the Implementation Rules does not include investments in credit or labor. 5. The public reserve fund mentioned in Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the Implementation Rules is limited to the public reserve fund stipulated by laws and regulations. 6. If there is an increase or decrease in capital during the business year, the average capital at the end of each month of that year should be used as the capital for that year. For example, if the capital in January is 100,000 yuan, and the capital increases to 150,000 yuan in October, then the capital should be calculated as the sum of 9 months multiplied by 100,000 yuan and 3 months multiplied by 150,000 yuan, divided by 12 months, resulting in 112,500 yuan. 7. For Category A and B for-profit enterprises, if the business period is less than one year or the business year is changed, when calculating their income, the capital should be converted according to the proportion of the business period or the transition period between the old and new periods to the entire year. For example, if the business period is 3 months, the net profit is 3,000 yuan, and the actual capital is 120,000 yuan, then 3 months is equivalent to one-quarter of the entire year of 12 months, so the actual capital for that period should be one-quarter of 120,000 yuan, which is 30,000 yuan. The net profit of 3,000 yuan for that period combined with the actual capital of 30,000 yuan is calculated as 18%. 8. If the business period in the preceding paragraph is less than one month, it will be counted as one month. 9. The term "total revenue" refers to the total income actually received and receivable from business operations. 10. The term "actual expenses" refers to the necessary and reasonable expenses actually paid and payable in business operations, as well as other losses and expenses other than bad debts, depreciation, inventory consumption. 11. The "public reserve fund prescribed by laws and regulations" is limited to the public reserve fund stipulated in Articles 170, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Company Law and the premium from issuing stocks exceeding the par value. If the public reserve fund has reached one-half of the total capital, the public reserve fund set aside cannot be used as a statutory public reserve fund. 12. The following items cannot be considered necessary and reasonable expenses and losses in business operations. If the taxpayer includes them in the profit and loss statement, they should be excluded when calculating net profit: (1) Interest on capital; (2) Profits distributed to shareholders, directors, supervisors, managers, and other employees; (3) Voluntary donations; (4) Expenses for expanding or renovating equipment in business operations; (5) Repair expenses for houses, factories, warehouses, machinery, tools, appliances, and ships that are sufficient to increase their original value or utility; (6) Losses from operating businesses other than the main business and affiliated businesses; (7) Losses from floods, fires, storms, the portion covered by insurance compensation. 13. Income tax already paid in business income should be deducted from the income tax payable. 14. The valuation of assets should be calculated according to the valuation method and the attached table. 15. Losses from the previous business year cannot be included in the calculation for this year. 16. For Category A and B for-profit enterprises, if the amount of remaining assets after liquidation or settlement due to merger, dissolution, closure, or transfer exceeds the original actual capital, the excess portion will be taxed at the tax rate in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations. 17. Taxpayers of Category A and B for-profit enterprises' income should, within three months after the end of each business year, fill out the Category A Report Form for Category One Income and submit a list of assets, balance sheet, profit and loss statement, or other books and documents sufficient to prove their income to the local competent tax collection authority in accordance with Article 24 of the Implementation Rules. 18. If a for-profit enterprise's income is calculated on an annual basis and the business period is less than one year or the business year is changed, the taxpayer should report the amount of income within 20 days after the settlement, following the procedures in the preceding paragraph. 19. For income from temporary for-profit enterprises that can be calculated based on capital, the taxpayer should report the amount of income within one month after the settlement, following the procedures in Item 17 of this notice. 20. For income from temporary for-profit enterprises that cannot be calculated based on capital, the taxpayer should fill out the Category B Report Form for Category One Income separately and report it to the local competent tax collection authority within one month after the settlement. 21. For Category A and B for-profit enterprises, if there is still income after liquidation or settlement due to merger, dissolution, closure, or transfer, they should fill out the Category C Report Form for Category One Income, follow the procedures in the preceding paragraph, and report the amount of income together with the liquidation or settlement statement. 22. For income from buying and selling in Articles 12, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Implementation Rules, the agent or payer paying the income should deduct the income tax payable in advance at the time of settlement or payment, submit it to the local Central Bank or its entrusted tax collection agency, obtain a receipt, and fill out the Category D Report Form for Category One Income daily, together with the withholding list, and report it to the local competent tax collection authority. 23. When the competent tax collection authority investigates or reviews Category A and B taxpayers, if they fail to provide the necessary books or transcribed books of assets and liabilities for transactions, inflows and outflows of money for the current or previous business year, or other documents sufficient to prove it, the competent tax collection authority may directly determine the amount of capital, income, and tax payable.

<h3>Business and Industry Inquiries About Income Tax Issues</h3>
<p>Accountant Shen Receives 500 Letters, Providing Detailed Replies Respectively</p>
<p>Since Mr. Shen Liren, the director of the Zhonghua Accounting Firm, published an article on the study of Article 15 of the Income Tax Implementation Rules in the Shen Bao a few days ago, because the end of the article included several questions and answers, it has aroused great attention from the business and industry community. In the past few days, the firm has received more than 500 letters from both local and out-of-town businesses inquiring about various issues related to income tax.

The firm has opened and classified these more than 500 letters one by one. Many of the questions asked are the same. Therefore, based on the main questions asked in more than 30 cases, Mr. Shen will successively add replies.</p>

If it can be implemented as ordered, it will eliminate discord and bring auspiciousness, which is the blessing of the country and the nation. In addition to telegraphed the military and political leaders of the Shaanxi 20th Army to obey the arrangements and strive for self-reliance, we especially lead the party members of the national seamen to sincerely support it. We hope that you will consider it. We also telegraphed Yang Hucheng, etc., saying, "Director Yang Hucheng of Xi'an and Chairman Yu Xiaohou of Lanzhou, Jianjian, the Xi'an Incident shocked the country, and since the turning point, all things have rejoiced. The central government has issued measures for the handling of the generals, which are based on the circumstances and the law, and take into account all aspects. All our people are convinced. You have made meritorious service in defending the country with arms. At this time, the false bandits in Suibian have not yet been annihilated, and the red invasion of the western border still exists. You should be aware of the warning of being in the same boat in the storm, and listen to the orders of the central government to handle the aftermath as soon as possible, follow the right track, and cover up the previous sins. Please do not hesitate, so as not to cause the nation's sorrow. We rush to telegraph, hoping that you will understand." (2) The 24 groups telegraphed the Central Executive Committee, "Nanjing Central Executive Committee Jian, the Xi'an Incident shocked the country. Thanks to the central government's skillful handling and the great power of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, it did not drown. Moreover, the handling of this incident respects national principles and preserves local vitality. Under the dual difficulties, the combination of grace and power is appropriate. We are grateful for the patriotic intentions and will never forget it. Zhang Xueliang and others should think about their mistakes and devote their remaining lives to repaying the country's generosity and establishing the foundation for our nation for ten thousand years. We always rely on the protection of the wind and clouds. We also telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, saying, "Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Nanjing, Mr. Yang Hucheng of Xi'an, and Mr. Yu Xiaohou of Lanzhou, Jian, the Xi'an Incident last month opened up a rare spectacle in ancient times. In terms of our country's history, you are almost inevitable. Fortunately, the central government cares for and bestows grace, and at the same time takes into account national principles. All the post-disaster arrangements are well-planned. All the Chinese people agree that you should trace your deep insights, lead the troops to obey wholeheartedly, and strive for self-reliance to help achieve the merit of reviving the nation and leave behind the principle of seeing righteousness and being brave. The future is bright, and we hope that you will follow it."</p>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Union sent a telegram to Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong yesterday, saying, "Director Yang Hucheng of Xi'an and Director Yu Xuezhong, Jian, the Xi'an Incident has already made a big mistake. Fortunately, the central government is generous, and the post-disaster arrangements for the Shaanxi Incident are in accordance with the law and the circumstances, and many loans have been granted. It should be inspired to make a good conscience and obey the orders of the pioneers, in order to seek late coverage. In a stormy and dangerous boat, we must be of one heart and one mind to reach the other shore. If we go against the road again, there will be terrifying waves, and we will not know where to succumb. We will all be drowned, and there must be those who will be held accountable. We sincerely telegraph, hoping that you will understand. Yang Hu, the special commissioner of the Chinese Seamen's Union, led the national seamen to kowtow." He also presented a telegram to the Central Party Department and the National Government, saying, "Nanjing Central Party Department and National Government Jian, our central government's arrangements for the post-disaster of the Shaanxi Incident are generous and have the painstaking efforts to stabilize the security situation and maintain the vitality of the country. All nationals admire it. It is heard that Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, etc. have not yet obeyed the orders.

<p>Li Zidong and Wang Suisheng, presidents of the Xi'an branch of the China Bank of Communications, left Xi'an on the 7th and arrived in Beijing on the 10th. Mr. Wang arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and went to the Bank of Communications to meet with Manager Tang Shoumin to report on the situation of the Shaanxi Incident and the business conditions of the branch. Mr. Li is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. According to Mr. Tu, the three banks of China, Zhongzhong, and Jiao in Xi'an are still operating as usual. However, due to the fact that railway transportation in Xi'an has not yet been restored, there is a great disconnect from the central government's intentions and all external situations, and rumors are rife in the city of Xi'an, and people are extremely panic-stricken. It is heard that there were a total of eleven people who entered Beijing from Xi'an this time, including Li and Wang, who were representatives of all circles in Xi'an to state the local situation. After arriving, they successively met with military and political authorities such as He Yingqin, Zhang Ji, Dai Chuanxian, and Yu Youren on the 11th and 12th. It is heard that He and others indicated that the central government has always been broad-minded in dealing with the Shaanxi Incident, so the key to peace lies entirely in whether Yang obeys the orders.</p>
<h3>Central Machinery Factory Transferred to the Ministry of Railways for Management</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the preparation of the Central Machinery Factory of the Ministry of Industries, it has been engaged in building factory buildings and installing machines.

<h3>The Swedish Chargé d'Affaires in China Promoted</h3>

Mr. Beck-Friis flew to Beijing the day before yesterday to meet with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Mo and others to notify. He will leave Beijing tonight and return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>New British Consul General in Shanghai, Philip, Will Return Home First</h3>
<p>Will Bring Family to Shanghai in September</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Guangzhou, Mr. Philip, the British Consul General in Guangzhou, who has been in office for seven years, has recently been transferred to the position of British Consul General in Shanghai. Before taking office, he will take a leave of absence to return home. Huang Musong, the Chairman of Guangdong, Yu Hanmou, the Director of Pacification of Guangdong, and Zeng Yangfu, the Mayor of Guangzhou, hosted a banquet on the night of the 12th to bid farewell to Mr. Philip. Many civil and military officials accompanied the banquet. Huang and Zeng were not in the province, so Yu delivered a short speech at the banquet, praising Mr. Philip's achievements in office, especially his efforts to enhance the friendship between the local people and the British expatriates. In addition, during the depression, Mr. Philip made every effort to maintain the trade between China and Britain in South China, so as to avoid the desolation, and his contribution is also worthy of praise. Mr. Philip then rose to reply, expressing his gratitude for the generous treatment given by the local officials over the years. He went on to say that his situation in office for several years was not easy, especially in the era when Guangzhou had an independent government. Fortunately, both sides were well-intentioned, so when encountering difficulties, they were able to resolve them harmoniously without involving the issue of diplomatic recognition. As a consul, his main responsibility was to get along well with the de facto authorities. He has always taken this as his goal, and he has achieved very satisfactory results. Now that Guangdong Province has returned to the central government, the political situation has been stabilized, and the new government's reconstruction plan has shown its noble purpose in a short period of time, and he is deeply confident in its great progress in the future. What is even more gratifying is the progress of the relationship between Hong Kong and Guangdong. He is fortunate to have helped a little in this regard. He knows that under the current enlightened government, the relationship between the two sides will definitely improve day by day. The Governor of Hong Kong's visit to Guangzhou last September and the Provincial Chairman and Mayor's visit to Hong Kong in November have aroused good impressions on both sides, which will surely last and not change. In November, a delegation from the business and financial circles of Guangzhou went to Hong Kong, which also greatly helped to promote friendship between the two places. Mr. Philip then expressed his regret at leaving Guangzhou, but at the same time he was relieved that he would still be serving in China for several years. He has great respect and love for China and finally wishes Guangdong Province to be tranquil after many years of turmoil and to be able to prosper for a long time. Mr. Philip will take his eldest daughter to Hong Kong on the 21st of this month, and then take a ship back to England. He plans to bring his family to Shanghai in September to take office.</p>
<h3>Labor Service Association Inspects Implementation Status</h3>
<p>To Increase Work Efficiency</p>
<p>This year's municipal government policy includes labor service as the second major item. Now, the Labor Service Association is sparing no effort to promote it with a spirit of solid work and quick action. The young men in each district are also spontaneously rising up and participating in the service. Moreover, some rural areas outside the designated district areas have also applied to hold the association one after another. As this year's project has been determined and announced, it is not convenient to change it. The remaining districts will be discussed later. It can be seen that the spirit of public interest, solidarity, and cooperation has penetrated the people, which is a great phenomenon for the revival of our nation. It is now learned that the association has sent Xiang Zhikui, Wu Menggong, Liu Zanqing, Zhang Bingfu, and Hong Zishou to various districts for inspection from this month to understand the implementation status of each district, and to provide guidance and correction to increase work efficiency.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Shanghai Telephone Bureau</h3>
<p>Expanding Business Area</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in light of the increasing development of industry and commerce in Shanghai, although the Ministry has uniformly revised the General Regulations for Urban Telephone Business, the original business area is too small. (According to the bureau, users outside the area have to pay extra-territorial engineering fees, pole fees, extra-territorial maintenance fees, etc.) Therefore, based on the requests of the industrial and commercial sectors, and taking into account the existing pole lines, the bureau has requested the Ministry to expand the original area. The current business area of the district is as follows: ㊀ Nanshi: east to the Huangpu River, south to the Huangpu River, west to the Rihui Port, and north to the Second Special District. ㊁ Zhabei: east to Tiyuhui Road and Shajing Port, south to Suzhou River and the First Special District, west to Zhongshan Road, and north to Shuidian Road, Liuying Road, and Zhongshan Road. ㊂ Longhua: east to Rihui Port, south to Longhua Port, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, Caohejing River and town, west to Zhongshan Road and Caoxi Road 300 meters, and Caohejing town, north to the Second Special District and Hongqiao town. ㊃ The four boundaries of the city center are limited to the Jiangwan town area and near the station in the city center (south to Shuidian Road, west 500 meters from the railway, and north to Jiangwan town). ㊄ Pudong: east to Pudong Road East 500 meters, south to Tangshui Jing, west to Huangpu River, and north to Majiabang. ㊅ Wusong: east to the Huangpu River, south to Yunzao Port, west to Sitang River, and north to Shuichan Road, Yongqing Road, and Taixing Road. ㊆ The four boundaries of Zhenru are limited to Zhenru street, the southern part of the university district, and 300 meters west of Taopu West Road to the Zhenru Radio Station. ㊇ Dachang: The four boundaries are based on the exchange as the center, with a business area of 1.5 kilometers east, west, north, and south.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Call Methods</h3>
<p>According to Shenzhou News Agency, according to the city telephone bureau yesterday, the Ministry of Communications stipulates that although urban telephone users have registered their installed telephones, paid long-distance telephone deposits, or filled out application forms, if they need to use a certain "unregistered telephone" to send long-distance calls, according to the current regulations, they must rush back to the location of their registered telephone or go to a nearby long-distance telephone retail outlet to register and wait before making a call. This causes a loss of time. If there is an important event that needs to be dealt with urgently, and they cannot be separated, it will inevitably lead to neglecting one thing and losing another, which is particularly inconvenient. In addition, regarding "calling someone to talk," if the caller or receiver is out for some reason when the long-distance call is connected and cannot talk, a fee should be paid and the call canceled according to regulations. However, if the caller or receiver knows where the other party is and that place is also equipped with a telephone, they should be allowed to apply to the telephone bureau for reconnection to facilitate the call. It is now learned that the Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate the public, has specially stipulated the following two methods: ㊀ Urban telephone users who have registered their installed telephones and paid a long-distance telephone deposit (or have filled out an application form for connecting to long-distance calls) and need to borrow another unregistered telephone (regardless of whether it belongs to the user) to send long-distance calls, and request that the long-distance call fee be recorded in the fee account of their registered telephone and paid, the telephone bureau can also handle it. However, this borrowed telephone is limited to being within the same urban telephone business area as the user's registered telephone. ㊁ Calling someone to talk: When connected, if the caller or the designated receiver is out for some reason, such as if the calling user knows where the receiver is, or the receiving user knows where the caller is, and the place is also equipped with a telephone that belongs to the same urban telephone business area as the calling user or receiving user, the user can tell the authorities the telephone number of that place for reconnection. If, after the telephone bureau reconnects to that place, the caller or receiver is still not found, the fee should be paid and the call canceled according to regulations. If the call is connected, only the call fee needs to be paid, and no additional fees will be charged for the reconnection procedure. It is reported that the above methods have been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to be implemented by the bureau from January 15 of this year. For detailed application and registration procedures, you can inquire and contact the local telephone bureau.</p>
<h3>Jing-Gan Railway Line Abandoning Tunxi, Fellow Townsmen from Huining Strenuously Contend</h3>
<p>The Association Sends Telegrams to Authorities Urgently</p>
<p>The Huining Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission, the National Economic Commission, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating (summary): "It has been found that the Jing-Gan Railway, from Xuancheng to Guixi, passes through a section of Huizhou. Recently, the Jing-Gan Railway Bureau intends to abandon Tunxi and open a new route, deciding to go from Yansi to Wan'an. In national railway construction, the first priority is transportation and facilitating merchants and travelers. Everything that benefits the country and the people is taken into consideration and planned as a whole. There is no need for detailed discussion. However, based on repeated reports from the gentry and people of Tunxi and the Chamber of Commerce of Xiuning County, Tunxi is the most important town in southern Anhui, with merchants gathering and luggage blocking the roads. The volume of goods transported is very large. In addition, with the completion of highways in recent years, the main stations of various bus routes converge here. Water and land transportation are particularly important. They deeply believe that if the railway does not pass through Tunxi, not only will the original economic construction be completely destroyed, but also the business of the railway will be greatly affected in the future. Judging from the facts, Tunxi has always been an important commercial center, with a long history, and has long been recognized. It is not only a major town in southern Anhui, but also the entire line from Guichi to Guixi cannot be compared with it. In terms of population, the entire town has more than 100,000 people. In terms of products, tea exports amount to about 7 million yuan per year, timber is worth 3 million yuan per year, bamboo shoots are worth more than 1 million yuan per year, charcoal is worth more than 1 million yuan per year, bamboo skin is worth 500,000 yuan per year, and shiitake mushrooms are worth 500,000 yuan per year. Other tung oil, rosin, and various mountain products are also worth 2-3 million yuan per year. The total value of exported products is no less than 16-17 million yuan, not including imported goods. Going south daily through Maotianpu and crossing Dongganmuling, there are large coal deposits and abundant minerals in this area. Mining will bring great benefits. Setting up Tunxi Station from here to Zikou, the distance from Zikou to Tunxi city is less than one mile. Going west from Tunxi, passing through the two major villages of Meilin and Panzhao, to reach Wan'an, although it is more than ten li, the benefits will be limitless in the future. Tunxi has the above-mentioned huge amount of products as the general hub for import and export, and the coal mine of Dongganmuling will further increase the railway's ability to absorb freight and develop its business. It does not seem appropriate to abandon Tunxi, which is the central hub for concentrating freight, and operate a new line. There is no such convenience. This is related to the commercial center of southern Anhui. The decline of Tunxi city is actually a turning point in the prosperity and decline of the entire Huizhou. Therefore, the Huizhou people are striving for the railway to pass through. This association observes the present, anticipates the future, and considers the national transportation, carefully weighing the advantages and disadvantages. We dare to contribute our humble opinions and respectfully ask your superiors to examine and approve our request, follow the opinions of the people, and still follow the planned route through Tunxi, and order the railway bureau to follow this implementation, in order to comply with the wishes of the people and comfort their expectations. We respectfully await your orders with anticipation. Huining Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai."</p>

<h3>This City Strictly Prohibits Opium and Drugs: Drug Offenders Have Nowhere to Hide</h3>
<p>Recent Arrests Bring Joy / Garrison Headquarters Executes Offenders According to Law</p>
<p>The police authorities in this city have been vigorously enforcing the prohibition of opium and drugs. According to the Interim Regulations on the Prohibition of Opium and Drugs promulgated by the Central Government, starting this year, anyone arrested for trafficking, manufacturing, or smoking drugs will be sentenced to death. The Shanghai Police Bureau expanded publicity at the end of last year to avoid punishing without warning. According to Director Ye of the Fourth Section of the City Police Bureau, speaking to a reporter from Guomin News Agency, a significant number of opium and drug offenders have still been arrested in the past half month. They have all been sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for punishment according to law. The Garrison Headquarters has also submitted the cases to the Opium Prohibition Supervisory Department for approval before execution. Therefore, no death sentences have been carried out in the past half month. It has been found that most of the recently arrested opium and drug offenders reside in the concessions, but their activities sometimes require them to go to train stations, ports, or other locations, so they cannot escape the eyes and ears of the inspectors. Moreover, the concessions have also severely punished arrested opium and drug offenders in accordance with the Interim Regulations on the Prohibition of Opium and Drugs. Therefore, drug offenders in this city have nowhere to hide. Unless they immediately go to a hospital to quit opium and drugs, they will rush to their deaths, and it will be too late to regret it.</p>
<h3>Han Shiyuan Returns Home, Arrives in Shanghai, Talks About Aircraft Manufacturing Competition in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Han Shiyuan, a first-class aircraft engineer who studied in France, Italy, England, and Germany, has returned to his motherland to contribute after living abroad for six years, specializing in on-site research on aircraft manufacturing, and inventing the Han Shi No. 101 high-altitude aircraft. Han returned home on the Potsdam, a ship of the Norddeutscher Lloyd, and arrived in Shanghai at 2 pm yesterday. Many people went to the ship to welcome him. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency interviewed him during his journey and recorded the details.</p>
<p>Aircraft Manufacturing Competition is Very Intense</p>
<p>In 1931, Mr. Han went abroad to France to study for three years and obtained an aircraft engineer degree, which is a rare honor for Chinese people overseas. He then went to England and Germany to study, and then to Germany to specialize in aircraft engine manufacturing, successively interning in aircraft manufacturing factories such as Fiar, Alla Romeo, Isotta Fraschini, and Riaggio for two years. According to Han, the emphasis on the air force in the military preparations of various countries in the world is an undeniable fact. This is because aircraft manufacturing is simple and the cost is lower than that of the navy. Italy, England, France, Germany, and other countries have intense competition in aircraft manufacturing, and the products are extremely fast. For example, Italian machine factories work 24 hours a day without stopping, and can produce more than 5,000 aircraft per year. The victory in the Italian-Abyssinian War was mainly due to aircraft. France also makes great efforts in aircraft manufacturing. The country with the highest aircraft production in the world is the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>China Needs to Manufacture its own Aircraft</p>
<p>After staying in Europe for six years, Mr. Han deeply felt that all countries in the world manufacture their own aircraft. He believes that the most important aspects of China's national defense are aircraft, submarines, and tanks, especially warplanes. However, they must all be self-made. If national defense industries are not self-reliant, it will be difficult to cope in case of an emergency, and there is a risk of being unable to purchase them. At the same time, there are questions about the strength of aircraft materials, the engines, and whether other tasks are completely sound. Therefore, he advocates that China manufacture its own aircraft.</p>
<h3>Prices of Newspapers and Magazines Sold on the Two Railways are Fixed</h3>

<h3>Joint Association of National Product Factories Concludes Factory Safety Investigation</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Product Manufacturers Association of this city, in view of the close relationship between factory security, industrial safety, and the lives of workers, in addition to having petitioned the authorities to negotiate and implement factory inspections in the concessions, now wants to understand the equipment situation of the member factories in the special zone. A factory safety equipment survey has been launched to promote improvement and serve as a reference for future government inspections. The association has specially developed a survey form, which is divided into items such as factory name, factory address, economic status, working hours, fire protection equipment, and sanitation. Special attention is paid to fire protection and hygiene. The association's move aims to improve the lives of workers and prevent accidents in factories, which is beneficial to both labor and capital.</p>
<h3>British-owned Ruirong Shipyard Cancels Labor-Capital Contract</h3>
<p>Mediation Fails to Yield Results / Workers' Emotions are Resentful</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, the Ruibing Machinery Shipyard in Yangshupu has always been founded by British merchants and employs hundreds of workers. The relationship between labor and capital is still satisfactory. Labor-capital conditions have been agreed with the Shipbuilding Workers Union of the Fourth District regarding all factory affairs and treatment methods, and they have been at peace for many years. On December 18 of last year, the factory suddenly notified its intention to cancel the original conditions and stop subsidizing union activities. On the 29th of the same month, it announced new holiday arrangements for the New Year. After receiving the notice, the workers were immediately suspicious and greatly disturbed. The union sent representatives to demand an explanation from the factory, but they refused to meet with the union representatives. A few days ago, the factory workers sent representatives to petition the party and government agencies. The Social Bureau sent Zhu Jintao and Fei Changhua, the Municipal Party Department sent Lu Yinchu, and the General Labor Union sent Zhu Xuefan to personally join the representatives in mediating with the factory. The factory's associate manager, Ai Mu (transliteration), received them and spoke firmly, saying that the labor-capital contract would no longer be signed according to the board of directors' decision, and the factory would formulate new methods. The factory was also unwilling to continue subsidizing union activities. The party and government representatives then vehemently stated the pros and cons and the current living conditions of the workers, asking them to consider carefully. The factory representative Ai Mu then agreed to convey the matter to the board of directors within a few days and reply. The workers are currently resentful, and if the matter is not resolved, it will inevitably lead to a major dispute.</p>

<h3>Robbery Attempt on a Social Enterprise Vehicle and a Water and Electricity Company</h3>
<p>Due to Thorough Reconnaissance and Tight Security, the Attempt Failed; Police Have Captured Multiple Robbers and Confiscated Firearms</p>
<p>The French Concession Water and Electricity Tram Company routinely disburses a significant amount of salaries on the [blank] day of each month. Last year, it was robbed by bandits, so the company requested that the police station assign detectives to provide protection every [blank]. The salary disbursement was scheduled for the tenth of the month [blank], so the company advanced the disbursement by [blank] days to the morning. Unexpectedly, bandits learned of this and rented a car from the Sixth Branch of the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, intending to rob the Water and Electricity Company in front of its premises. However, seeing the [blank] police [blank], they could not proceed [blank]. The bandits abandoned the car on the [blank] road. The patrol police discovered it and reported it to the police station, which instructed the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company to retrieve the car. The circumstances of the car being rented and found on Kangti Road were briefly reported. Yesterday morning at [blank] and a half, French Concession police inspectors received a tip-off from Futian Li Xian and others, stating that the gang of robbers were hiding in the forty-room dwelling at the intersection of Caishi Road and Father Du Road. They immediately led detectives Zhou Bingcheng, Lu Daorong, Bian Zhixiang, Tao Ronglin, Shen Jin, Weng Huanzhang, Dai Rongji, Xu Kaixing, and others, fully armed, to the address. They arrested the robber Shen Chaoyu (35 years old, from Qingjiang). According to Shen, they had attempted to rob the French Concession Water and Electricity Tram Company on the ninth of this month but failed. He also revealed the whereabouts of his accomplices. The detectives then took Shen to the back of the Keluo Road number 19 [blank] and arrested Liang Honggen (33 years old, from Funing) and his brother Liang Zhujiu (20 years old, working as a bodyguard for a Mr. Bei) from Funing. According to Liang Honggen, there were pistols and Mauser pistols hidden in the attic of a bungalow at number 6, row 4, on Pingjili Road in Songqingfang. The detectives then went to the attic of number 64 Songqingfang and further arrested Qiu Rufu (48 years old, from Funing) and his son Qiu Dingkui (18 years old), as well as Tao Muxi (28 years old, from Jiancheng), all three of whom lived by pulling rickshaws. They also found a Browning pistol and a Mauser pistol, along with nine bullets, under the attic floorboards. They then proceeded to number 1111, Chi Nei number 1, Xietu Road in the Chinese area and arrested Wang Changyu (28 years old, from Yangzhou) and Jia Henghe (31 years old, from Jiancheng). In total, they apprehended eight robbers. When the detectives arrested Liang Honggen at number 9 Keluo Road, Liang saw detective Shen Jinshu holding a pistol and attempted to seize it. However, the struggle was too intense, and the pistol went off, the bullet piercing Liang's left hand and left foot. He fell to the ground, injured. The detectives then sent Liang to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They escorted the remaining seven robbers, along with the pistols and Mauser pistols, back to the police station for detention. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Special Court for questioning. Judge Sun Peng, acting as a trial judge, opened the criminal court. Attorney Yuan Jiahong from the Police Department stated that the defendants were arrested for robbery, and the Police Department had not yet completed its investigation, requesting a two-week adjournment for further questioning. Shen Chaoyu testified that he did not know who owned the pistols and Mauser pistols and denied attempting to rob the Water and Electricity Company but admitted to knowing that Zhang Wanfang had initiated and discussed the robbery with Liang Honggen. He also claimed to not know which company they were planning to rob. Qiu Rufu testified that he made a living pulling rickshaws. On the 29th day of the twelfth lunar month, Zhang Wanfang asked him to take the pistols and Mauser pistols to Jiangbei to sell them. He refused to go, and later Zhang brought them to his house himself. He was out at the time, and his roommate told him that "a big guy" (referring to Zhang Wanfang) had come. Later, he saw a child's clothes wrapping the pistol in the attic. Yesterday, he looked for Zhang all day but could not find him and was unaware of the robbery. Liang Zhujiu testified that Honggen was his cousin. Honggen used to be a junior patrolman at the Bei residence and later passed the job on to him. He knew nothing about the robbery. The remaining four defendants all claimed to be unaware of the robbery. Liang Honggen was not escorted to court due to his injuries in the hospital. The court verified the testimonies and adjourned the hearing to 2 PM on the 25th. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Land Brokers' Extortion by the Land Bureau</h3>
<p>To Facilitate People's Certificate Renewal</p>
<p>The Shanghai Land Bureau has learned that when people renew land certificates, they are sometimes required to obtain guarantees from land brokers due to incomplete procedures. These brokers often engage in extortion, greatly affecting the prospects of certificate renewal. The Land Bureau has ordered all land brokers to strictly prohibit such practices. The edict is appended below for compliance. Since taking office, the director of this bureau has frequently heard of extortion by land brokers, making certificate renewal a daunting task for property owners. While there are certainly law-abiding land brokers in this city, which is vast with numerous properties, there are also those who engage in improper and fraudulent conduct. At a time when governance is being reformed and corruption eliminated, efforts should be made to rectify the situation. In addition to sending bureau personnel for covert investigations, any brokers found engaging in such activities will be severely punished according to the law. This is hereby announced for strict compliance and self-examination. Do not say you were not warned. This edict is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Court to Implement Bell for Filing Lawsuits Today</h3>
<p>Following the Ancient Practice of Setting up a Drum for Appeals, Promoting Verbal Complaints to Benefit the People; the Regulations for Using the Appeal Bell are Promulgated</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office, to facilitate emergency complaints from the public and to assist impoverished people who cannot afford to purchase legal documents, has installed an electric bell at the west gate of the court. This is similar to the ancient practice of beating a drum to voice grievances, allowing people to file lawsuits verbally. This matter has already been reported. The Prosecutor's Office of the court now issues Bulletin No. 1153 to ensure that the public understands the installation of the appeal bell and its usage regulations. It officially begins today. The text of the bulletin and the provisional regulations for using the appeal bell are excerpted below.</p>
<p>Court Bulletin</p>
<p>The law clearly states that people can report crimes verbally through complaints, accusations, or confessions. This was originally intended to benefit the people. However, due to ignorance of the law or situational constraints, it is rarely implemented, rendering the beneficial law a mere formality and failing to uphold the fundamental intent of national legislation. Efforts should be made to promote it to benefit the people. Therefore, following the ancient system of setting up a drum for appeals, an electric bell, named the Appeal Bell, has been installed at the west gate of this office. It is specifically for people to make verbal complaints, accusations, or confessions. Provisional rules for using the Appeal Bell have been established for compliance. Additional prosecutors, clerks, and judicial police have been assigned to rotating duty to handle matters promptly. Starting from January 15th of this year, individuals who genuinely face urgent circumstances and cannot prepare written documents, or who are impoverished and cannot afford legal documents, and wish to make verbal complaints, accusations, or confessions, are permitted to use it. The bell connects directly to the offices of the Chief Prosecutor, prosecutors, clerks, and judicial police. Once pressed, all offices will sound simultaneously. The judicial police on duty will immediately lead the person into the court. The prosecutor and clerk will immediately conduct an inquiry and create a written record according to the law to conduct investigations. The Chief Prosecutor may also monitor the diligence of subordinates and the truthfulness of the people's claims. The public must understand that the purpose of setting up this bell is to uncover crime and to show compassion to the people. All should understand this intention and use it cautiously. Anyone who dares to make false accusations out of spite will be severely punished without leniency. Therefore, the provisional rules for using the Appeal Bell are copied and announced to all people within the jurisdiction for general knowledge and strict compliance. This is an urgent bulletin. Chief Prosecutor Zhu Huanbin.</p>
<p>Bell Usage Regulations</p>
<p>Here are the provisional regulations for using the Appeal Bell: Article 1: This office has installed an electric bell, named the Appeal Bell, to facilitate verbal complaints, accusations, or confessions from the public, so that people can use it in accordance with these regulations. Article 2: The Appeal Bell shall not be used without authorization unless one of the following conditions is met for making a verbal complaint, accusation, or confession: 1. In urgent circumstances where it is impossible to prepare written documents. 2. Those who are impoverished and cannot afford legal documents. Article 3: The Appeal Bell is managed by the judicial police on duty, who will also guide its use and must not suppress or obstruct its use. Article 4: Anyone wishing to make a verbal complaint, accusation, or confession must, upon pressing the bell, follow the instructions of the on-duty police in Article 3, stand still at the bell and await the judicial police to lead them into the court and must not leave without authorization. Article 5: The prosecutor on duty shall immediately lead the clerk to the court after hearing the bell and the clerk shall create a written record according to the law. Article 6: Anyone violating Article 2 of these regulations will be ordered to provide written documents. Article 7: If a complainant or accuser is found to have made false accusations out of spite, they will be dealt with according to the law. Article 8: These regulations will be submitted to the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Office and then to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for record-keeping. Article 9: These regulations may be amended at any time if there are any omissions. Article 10: These regulations shall take effect on January 15th, the 26th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Wu Qigen and Others Accused of Extorting Money from a Female Guide</h3>
<p>Inviting a Female Guide to a Room in a Hotel; After All Sorts of Insults, Using Pretexts to Extort Money</p>
<p>The Yongjian Tiansheng Guide Agency at 305 Gongqing Building, 454 Hankou Road, is organized by Li Lili (25 years old), a woman from Ningbo, who employs about 12 female staff members. In September of last year, Li sued her employees Xu Changxian and others for damage. In December, a child named Ji Wentian, hired by Li to distribute leaflets, stole a woolen sweater from female doctor Zhang Jin at Yan Maoyuan. Li invited Zhang to a teahouse to discuss the matter, which was reported to the police, who detained and released her due to insufficient evidence. Now, Li has reported to the police that Wu Qigen and two others extorted money from her. The facts are that Wu Qigen from Haimen, Chen Yonglin from Ningbo, and Zhang Asheng, all idlers, checked into room 110 at the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road the day before yesterday. At 6 PM, they telephoned the Tiansheng Agency for a female guide. Li Lili ordered Zhang Ying (19 years old), a Shanghai woman, to respond to the call. After Zhang arrived, Wu and the others behaved in a lewd and scandalous manner. Wu then took Zhang to room 420 on the fourth floor, where there were seven or eight other men. They subjected Zhang to insults and attempted to force her to engage in indecent acts with Wu. Zhang, unable to bear the humiliation, burst into tears. Wu, considering this unlucky, became angry and ordered Zhang to be confined in room 110. He then summoned Li Lili, demanding that Li provide two "gaozi" (a vulgar term) or pay 20 yuan for Zhang to return to the agency. Li apologized and stated that she did not have any money on her, promising to discuss it the next day. However, Wu and the others refused. Li then managed to notify the agency. Tea servant Li Asan reported to Chinese detectives Song Wenqing and officer 3263 from the Lao Zha Police Station, who rushed to the scene and arrested Wu, Chen, and Zhang. Numerous slips of paper with hotel telephone numbers and addresses of private prostitutes were found on Zhang's person. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police attorney Ru Baoyi charged them with extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Code, stating that the three defendants had previous convictions with fingerprints on file and requesting severe punishment according to the law. Li Lili and Zhang Ying testified one after another. The three defendants denied the extortion, claiming that when Li Lili arrived, Zhang Ying had been at the hotel for more than one hour but less than two, so they asked her to wait until she had been there for two hours before returning to the agency. Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the testimonies and concluded the debate, scheduling the sentencing for next Thursday. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Lao Zha Police Officer Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Still Possibly Salvageable</p>
<p>Our local news agency reports that police officer number 2882, a young Chinese officer from Lao Zha Police Station, attempted suicide by shooting himself at the station yesterday afternoon at 4 PM. The officer excused himself at 4 PM and went to the Chinese police office. He placed his service pistol to his temple and pulled the trigger. Fortunately, the bullet exited the front of his head without damaging the brain. He was rushed to the police hospital in an ambulance. By 5:20 PM, he had regained consciousness and is expected to make a full recovery.</p>
<h3>Child Bitten by Rat</h3>
<p>Bleeding and Face Covered</p>
<p>Yang Koucheng, 31 years old from Funing, a resident of a bungalow on Qingyang Branch Road in Zhabei, earns a living as a worker. He is married to He, 27 years old. In October of last year, they had a son, nicknamed Xiaogouzi, who is lively and clever. Yesterday morning around 9 AM, He was washing clothes by the tap when she suddenly heard her child crying incessantly. She rushed to check and found that Xiaogouzi's nose and lips had been bitten off by a rat, and his face was covered in blood. The rat ran away when it saw people. He immediately rushed her son to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Unlicensed Hotels Prosecuted, Tried, and Fined by the Police</h3>
<p>Superficially Operating as "Lettered Warehouses," But Actually, Facilities are Crude, Harboring Filth</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department recently received a tip-off stating that there is a type of disguised hotel operating within the concession, calling themselves "Lettered Warehouses." They do not pay for licenses from the Public Works Department and engage in all sorts of filthy practices. The tip-off requested strict action. Therefore, Chinese police chief Lu Dagong and Western police chief Mike Waylen of the Lao Zha Police Station were ordered to investigate. After verifying the facts, they filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court, accusing eight "Lettered Warehouses" of violating Article 34 of the Public Works Department Land Regulations and Articles 33 and 18 of the Prohibition and Punishment Laws: Changshun at No. 4 Songjiang Lane; Yongkang at No. 8, Lane 21, Hubei Road; Tongshungong at No. 10, Lane 488, Aiduya Road; Huyuanxing at No. 10, Lane 47, Xishanglin Street; Yongxingxie at No. 28, Lane 117, Shandong Road; Minyong at No. 439, Yuegui Lane, Guangdong Road; Taifengyong at No. 54, Tongli; Tongyi at No. 16, Lane 118, Zhejiang Road. Yesterday morning, the Special Court summoned the responsible persons of the eight establishments to the Ninth Criminal Court. Attorney Qian Xunjiu, specially dispatched by the Legal Department of the Public Works Department, presented the case, stating that on October 5th of last year, the Public Works Department received a letter from the Shanghai Association of the Same Trade, stating that there were many disguised hotels operating in the city, calling themselves "Lettered Warehouses." They were operating publicly without licenses and hiring tea servants to solicit travelers, and also offering gambling and opium. The Police Department was not paying attention and should investigate strictly. The police then dispatched Chinese and Western police chiefs on the 28th of last month to investigate and verified the facts. The defendants were informed that they had to obtain licenses from the Public Works Department from January 1st of this year, otherwise they would not be allowed to operate, and they would be prosecuted. When the police went to investigate on January 5th, the defendants were still operating as usual and without licenses. The only difference between the "Lettered Warehouses" set up by the defendants was the sign hanging outside the door. However, because they do not have licenses, if criminals hide inside, the police cannot inspect them. Moreover, the facilities are crude and unsanitary, and a fire would be disastrous. The Public Works Department had no choice but to take strict action to protect the safety of residents, and to prosecute according to the law. According to Article 24 of the Public Works Department Land Regulations, a fine of up to 100 yuan can be imposed, and while continuing to violate the law without obtaining a license, a fine of up to 25 yuan can be imposed every 24 hours. He requested that the penalties be severe. Judge Shen questioned the defendants briefly and sentenced each of them to a fine of 30 yuan or 20 yuan as a warning.</p>
<h3>Eleven People Tremble Simultaneously After Lunch</h3>
<p>Pork and Tofu Cooked Together; Patients Injected for Treatment</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM yesterday, police officer Li Jinsheng, badge number 47 from the Gaochangmiao Police Station of the Municipal Police Department, reported that 11 workers at the Datong Melon Seed Factory at No. 2, Lane 454, Laoyingpan Road, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Yao Jiqing, Zhu Fuqing, Wang Jiasheng, Wang Kangnian, Xie Dasheng, Du Achun, and the factory owner Hong Yifu, etc., all vomited and trembled after lunch, losing consciousness and in a dangerous state. At lunchtime, they had cooked pork from Tang Changgen Meat Shop in Gaochangmiao, Youdoufu Gan from Fengzhen Kang Tofu Shop, and exposed soy sauce from Yichangtai at No. 46, Ximen Road, French Concession. Unexpectedly, after eating, they developed this condition. All of the above were rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. Subsequently, Patrol Captain Ma Shijun from the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Police Department, along with Detective 177 from the Public Concession Police Department, went to the hospital to investigate. Each person is currently receiving injections for treatment, and their lives can be guaranteed. They are all conscious but feel pain in their lower backs and hands. It has not yet been determined whether it was poisoning or an epidemic. The police department has ordered the owners of the tofu shop and meat shop to come to the station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Opium Den Uncovered in Old School Field</h3>
<p>Chen Shusheng, a household registration officer from the Yimiao Police Station, led police officer Li Ming last night at 9 PM to investigate opium dens within his jurisdiction. He smelled opium in the Old School Field at 103 Lane and secretly investigated, finding that the smell was coming from inside number 5. However, that house could not be entered directly, so they had to enter through the barber shop at number 65, a clever arrangement that made it a large-scale opium and gambling den. He immediately covered the stairs and secured the doors on both floors. He then drove the opium smokers and gamblers into one room and had Officer Fang call the police station to send a large patrol unit to surround and arrest them. They caught the den owner, Chen Cunfu (54 years old, from Nanjing), as well as 16 male and female opium smokers and gamblers including Zhang Ziga et al. They seized four opium pipes and lamps, as well as opium residue trays, pots, dragon heads, and three sets of mahjong tiles, all being used for gambling. They also found an account book with dozens of opium smokers and gamblers, and evidence that it had been operating for a long time, selling more than ten taels of opium daily. All were taken to the police station for questioning. It was also discovered that the sub-tenant of the house was Li Renan, who had signed a guarantee but failed to report the opium den, clearly providing shelter. He has been ordered to come in for questioning. The den owner Chen Cunfu had been repeatedly escaped arrest in previous opium cases. This is the first time he has been arrested, and he will be handed over to the General Bureau and transferred to headquarters for severe punishment.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Factory Demand Gradually Developing</p>
<p>Cotton Market Tightens Further</p>
<p>Coupled with Large Yarn and Cotton Price Differences</p>
<p>The cotton market is slightly firm, because the political situation in Shaanxi and Gansu is unstable, and the source of supply from the Northwest may be blocked. In addition, the price difference between yarn and cotton is too large, and new sellers are becoming increasingly scarce. At the same time, the current demand from cotton mills is developing, and the market sentiment is tightening further.</p>
<p>Cotton Countertops Stable Market opening before marked cotton, US and Indian cotton markets have declined, but the decline is not strong. The overall trend is still in a hovering situation, so the market situation has not changed much, but the Osaka Sanpin cotton has fluctuated greatly in recent days. Each month has risen by 4.5 jiao to 1.78 yuan and 2 yuan outside. People's hearts are revived, and each month has risen. As a result, each month rose by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market was slightly tired in the afternoon opening. Because Sanpin cotton fell by another 1 yuan outside, sellers in the market were not strong, so the countertops were still able to support. As a result, the near month was still flat compared to the morning closing price, and the far month rose by 5 fen. It was found that He Xing sold 1,200 dan, Tongfeng 1,000 dan, Fukang 1,200 dan, Yikang 1,700 dan, Changhe 1,200 dan, Gengfeng 2,900 dan, Dafeng 900 dan, and Xincheng 900 dan. Tongfu bought 1,100 dan, Yudai 1,200 dan, Renfeng 2,400 dan, Yuanyi 6,400 dan, Dachangcheng 1,400 dan, Changfeng 1,100 dan, Runkang 1,100 dan, and Yuanda 1,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices in a day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Current Cotton Consumption Improves The current cotton mill's appetite is expanding, with 1,680 bales of Yao cotton and 1,919 bales of Tong cotton coming in.</p>
<p>Futures Yarn Returns From Brilliance To Dullness</p>
<p>The Final Settlement Period Is Approaching</p>
<p>Both Parties' Bets Are Not Over</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and transactions are particularly light, so the auction time is shorter. In fact, as the final settlement period approaches, both long and short sides have a degree of settlement. Customer sales are stagnant, and people's hearts are even less motivated. In addition, Osaka's Sanpin yarn has risen and fallen sharply, making it very difficult to grasp. Sanpin yarn resumed full-day business yesterday, with a big rise at the opening and a fall at the closing. The market fell again in the afternoon opening, and the closing was flat. As a result, the price fell by 5 jiao to 7.4 jiao yuan compared to the price of the previous day.</p>
<p>Gengfeng Enters In The Morning And Exits In The Afternoon Market opening before marked yarn, each month turned to high-flying. Because the Sanpin yarn that had plummeted the previous day rebounded by 7-8 yuan to 10 yuan, people's hearts were agitated. Gengfeng came again to enter the February period in large quantities. The distant period was affected, and the market rose slowly, but the current yarn business was quiet, and the industry still had no intention of offsetting. However, the closing price of Sanpin fell back, falling 3-4 yuan to 6 yuan. When the telegram arrived, the marked yarn had already closed. The result of the marked yarn was that each month rose by 1.3458 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market opened in the afternoon. Because the opening price of Sanpin yarn fell again by 456 yuan in the afternoon, the market situation was hit by it, but new sellers were not very enthusiastic, and the decline was not strong. Current yarn transactions were still meager. Gengfeng came again to sell out. As a result, each month fell by 469 jiao to 1.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Gengfeng Dachangcheng bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon. It was found that Yudai sold 1,200 bales, Juxing 500 bales, Hengyi 400 bales, Senkang 700 bales, Renfeng 750 bales, Wang Taixing 1,300 bales, Yidai 550 bales, Taichang 500 bales, and Yichang 1,050 bales. Zhendai bought 1,650 bales, Hexing 1,950 bales, Taixing 400 bales, Runkang 750 bales, Xiesheng 1,600 bales, Yuanda 600 bales, Shengyuan 600 bales, and Mingde 400 bales. The highest and lowest prices in a day are listed on the left.</p>

<p>American Cotton Bulls Cannot Close</p>
<p>Industry Is Still Waiting For Progress On Loaned Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with each month falling 8 pounds to rising 1 pound. Transactions were still active. The January period fell because there were 22 delivery notices, and the bulls closed. The distant early period was firm because of industry activities buying in. Later, because the March period was at 1.25 jiao, the bulls continued to close. Finally, the buying interest of peers declined, merchants watched, and the market was tired. There were many long and short positions among foreign merchants. The industry is still waiting for the progress of loaned cotton. The closing was firm. It is estimated that spot fell by 3 pounds, and futures fell by 2-4 pounds. British cotton spot rose by 6 points, and futures did not move. Indian cotton was initially tired due to the sharp fall in Japanese yarn. Then it recovered due to rising stock prices and purchases by industry and investors. Finally, the market price softened again due to cross-selling by cotton merchants and short-selling by short accounts. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell by 0.50 to 0.75 rupees, Aomula fell by 0.25 to 0.75 rupees, and Bairo Creek fell by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram recorded on the left (13th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast on the 14th was that Bairo Creek would be 231 rupees, Aomula would be 208 rupees, and Pingguoer would be 184.25 rupees, all down by 0.25 rupees.</p>
<p>Sanpin Yarn's Falling Trend Is Still Severe</p>
<p>According to an Osaka telegram on the 14th, the price of Sanpin yarn fell by 1.6 yuan to 7.4 yuan in each month. The closing price for the near month was 285.5 yuan, and the closing price for the far month was 266.1 yuan. In addition, the price of cotton rose by 1.35 yuan to 1.15 yuan in the distant month, and fell by 0.65 yuan to 1.4 yuan in the remaining months. The closing price for the near month was 75.3 yuan, and the closing price for the far month was 78.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Changes With The Yarn Market</p>
<p>Customer Gangs Search For Spot Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the continued decline in the Sanpin yarn market, and the sluggish sales of domestic yarn, plain cotton cloth, Dongpi fine cloth, and fine twill continued to fall (per piece) by 2.5 fen to 5 fen. Fine cloth and fine twill from domestic factories fell by 2.5 fen to 1 jiao. The market for coarse cloth was stable. Dyed cloth, dyed twill, Zhigong bige, and line呢prices were all stable. Spot sales gradually increased, because futures prices were consistently high, and customer gangs' thoughts of searching for cheap spot goods became more active. The Beilu Shandong gang continued to handle 100 boxes of white ground satin at 6.34 yuan and Kewulu silk at 7.12 yuan. The Yunnan gang added more than 100 packages of fine twill from domestic factories. Wholesale stores and dyeing factories on this street continued to handle more than 300 packages of white goods, fine cloth, fine twill, raw cloth, dyed cloth, and blank goods. The intake of the Sichuan, Guangdong, Fujian, Yangtze, Ningbo and other gangs were all said to be not bad, so the market situation was still very consolidated. The selling price of imported Japanese goods continued to be firm. Yanjing Foreign Firm opened nearly 100 boxes of three and four months futures of medium-grade twill silk, and the price has risen from (per yard) 5 jiao 3 fen to 6 jiao 6.5 fen.</p>
<p>Yuanfang Piece Goods Ask For Lower Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 3,023rd auction of Yuanfang Foreign Firm in this port. For the Lunar New Year, the old regulations were still followed to allow six weeks of deferred cash delivery. Five kinds of goods were displayed: Western satin, yuan velvet, Zhigong ne, feather silk, and foreign red cloth. The auction price was inferior to the previous period. Western satin was auctioned for five brands. The price of Lion, He, and Monkey fell by 3 fen per yard, Fox, Cow, and Matrix rose by 4 fen, Zhigong ne rose by 3 fen, Yuan velvet was flat, and feather silk was auctioned for 51 brands. The price of Andianbao silk rose by 7.75 jiao, the price of Zhulin Bozi two brands rose by half a yuan, and the price of Hainiu Weimiao two brands each fell by 5 jiao. The rest only rose or fell by 1-2 jiao, but the flat ones were more numerous. 7 pounds of foreign red cloth were auctioned, which were heavy-weight goods. There has been a shortage for a long time, and industry people raised prices and competed with each other. The price was particularly strong.</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Flour Intended To Rise But Instead Fell</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, showed signs of initial stability followed by a decline in each month. According to the Reuters New York telegram on the 13th, the Chicago wheat market opened with good foreign news. It was reported that the UK would implement a wheat and grain storage plan, and the current demand was heavy. The market was firm and prices rose by 25 to 875. In addition, Canada rose by 1 jiao and Liverpool rose by 1 penny. After the opening price was announced, the price of foreign wheat rebounded, and people's hearts inevitably improved. Each month was better than the previous day by 1 fen. However, current sales were not smooth, and industry people rarely inquired. Therefore, transactions were scarce, and the market could not hold firm. Therefore, by the closing, it fell back by 1 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, the current month was partly due to settlement and partly because current sales were not smooth. People outside the industry slightly returned. The market felt sluggish, and the distant period was also because buying was not strong, and industry people were more pessimistic, so it also gradually loosened. According to the current situation, it is always because the price is too high, and sales in the sales area have decreased, making it difficult for speculators to exert force.</p>
<p>Wheat Market Lifeless</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in the morning, each month generally showed a state of stagnation. Only because of the final settlement, customer transactions gradually ended. The competition in the market was less, so there was little fluctuation, and there was no color at all. Each month only had a fluctuation of 1-2 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, transactions were more active, and the distant period also slightly improved. However, the current month was very flat due to the sluggish current sales. The wheat market was tired due to the sluggish sales, and the current wheat situation was even more depressed. Because there were only transactions in the market, and most of the goods had been put on the stack, the total market only had more than 1,000 packages of transactions, and the price did not change.</p>
<p>Customer Indica Transactions Have Already Decreased</p>
<p>Only More Than 6,000 Packages Were Transacted In The Market Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were still more than 10,000 packages of customer indica that arrived, but after the Yue and Shantou gangs smoothly handled transportation every day, the intake was slightly relaxed. The merchants on this street watched, and the sales also decreased. The total number of transactions in the market decreased from 230,000 packages to more than 8,000 packages. The arrival of more sales in the fine market has already softened. In addition, the cargo owners are selling one after another, and the situation is even softer. Fortunately, most of the cargo owners are unwilling to easily sell, and the market price is only slightly 2-3 fen. 4,630 packages of Gan rice, 200 packages of Zhe rice, 500 packages of Han rice, 615 packages of Yongyuan, and 60 packages of Xiaojiao were opened throughout the day. The Shantou and Yue gangs took a total of 2,000 packages, and the rest were all taken by this street.</p>
<p>Rice Movement Arose Slightly On This Street</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of each gang totaled 50 numbers, and there were 11,200-11,300 stone of goods in total. Among them, there were 26-27 numbers of Bo rice. The sales market on this street moved slightly more than before, but the appetite was still light. Only the Qingdao gang handled nearly 2,000 packages of Bo rice, so the market for Bo rice was still weak, and the market price continued to repair several fen to about 1 jiao. The early rice in Nangang also fell by a few fen. Only Sutong japonica, because the supply and demand were similar, had no honor or disgrace. However, the situation also showed a soft trend. Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan were still a fixed situation.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 26-27 boats arrived from various routes in Heshang. The merchants and stores in the market moved slightly. The price of white japonica was similar to the previous market. High-quality Bo rice was outstanding, and the middle and inferior quality showed softness. The sales of early rice were still good, and the price was firm. Yin Yuan goods were scarce and the sales were active, and the price was tight. White Yuan goods were popular, and retail goods were not smooth, and the price was soft by a few fen. The price of other goods was stable.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake Trend Is Quite Optimistic</p>
<p>The Soybean Cake Market Situation Has Been Quite Optimistic Recently. The Dalian Market Has Risen More And Fallen Less. The Soybean Market Situation Is Also Easy To Rise And Difficult To Fall. The Standard Market Price Adheres To A Stable Situation. This Has Caused A Selling Mindset And Transactions. Furthermore, Sales Markets Such As Shantou And Xiamen Continue To Inquire, So The Market Price Tends To Rise A Fraction Each Plate. According To The Changde Factory Report Yesterday, The Factory's Four-Brand Cake Has Opened To 2.05 Yuan, The Changji Factory's Four-Brand Opened To 2.04 Yuan, Only The Dachang New Factory Opened To 2.02 Yuan. The Total Market Transaction Of Each Factory's Four-Brand Factory Was 15,000 Pieces.</p>

<p>U.S. Feared Not to Maintain Silver Policy</p>
<p>But Allowed to Buy New Mine Silver at Special Price</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th - This week's silver market saw a sudden decline in demand from India, and a tendency to sell. China and speculators continued to sell, with only slight purchases from Europe. The soft trend was due to news from Washington that Congress and the Treasury, apart from allowing the purchase of newly mined American silver at a special price, lacked enthusiasm for retaining the silver policy. The potential for labor was weak. If Indian demand does not recover, banks are expected to continue to fall. The securities market paid the most attention to South African gold mine stocks, with extremely strong buying interest.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Government Bonds Trading More Active in Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of government bonds in the China National Securities Exchange continued to fluctuate. The market sentiment was also dull and leisurely.

However, as the delivery period gradually approached, the current account for this month was still huge, and the bulls and bears gradually had the giving and swap transactions, and the market price was brewing, with the change to closing being more prevalent, and unanimously rising. However, as the current situation is still chaotic, the trend of the bond market is still difficult to break away from this numb and insensitive status quo. Yesterday morning, the market opened with a quiet mood, and the buying and selling became more and more sparse. Retail investors also mostly conducted sporadic transactions. Except for the Renbing stock futures falling by $0.10, and the Jia stock rising by $0.10 next month, the rest were unanimously similar to the previous market. The secondary market was still extremely dull. No. 47 and No. 5 were mostly offered, while No. 34 was mostly bought. The market price was in a stalemate between the bulls and bears, with varying rises and falls. When the afternoon market opened, the market situation turned firm and expensive, and the buying interest of retail investors turned stronger. No. 38 and No. 77 were purchased quite a lot, and Renjia and others all rebounded by $0.05 to $0.30. The closing trend became more and more stable. The buying of No. 79 and No. 50 was very strong, while the selling of No. 10 and No. 11 was quite a lot. The market price continued to rise by $0.05 to $0.15. The overall result for the day was that except for the Mao stock futures slightly weakening by $0.05 next month, all others rose by $0.05 to $0.30. The total number of transactions was $4,945,000.

<h3>Special Article</h3>
<p>— (Translated by Shufei)</p>
<p>Reasons for the Soaring Paper Prices (Continued)</p>
<p>The paper market in Shanghai was relatively calm in the first half of 1936. German and Canadian reel paper were actively traded. Transaction prices were all at a low price between £6 19 shillings and £7 17 shillings and 6 pence per ton. In January, Canadian paper tried to raise the price to £8 5 shillings, but as a result, it finally could not compete with the low price of German paper, and it was reduced to £7 18 shillings in March. In January, the economic status of general paper merchants was greatly endangered. During the Lunar New Year holiday, eight paper merchants and several silver firms were in a state of suspension. Although the smuggling wave in North China in the spring, according to the customs report, did not have smuggled paper other than cigarette paper, the paper industry and the exchange industry were therefore showing instability and anxiety. The price of paper in Shanghai often hovered at a low price until August, especially "pure newsprint" (Woodtreeprintfngs) and "large writing paper" (Cap) were even more sluggish, but during this period, "machine-made paper" (Mechanical Prints), "large writing paper", "colored printing paper" (Clromo) and "pure newsprint" also made a lot of considerable transactions with German merchants at low prices. Canadian and Scandinavian "kraft paper" (Kraft Paper), as well as American high-quality paper, such as "document paper" (Document Paper), were also traded quite actively.</p>
<p>May and June of last year were the most sluggish periods in the Shanghai paper market, and it improved slightly between July and September. Canadian paper increased its price in September due to the rising world market, and American paper took the opportunity to move. In August and September, American newsprint won some orders at £7 17 shillings and 6 pence. In October, German newsprint rose to £8 15 shillings, and Scandinavian newsprint rose to over £9. The trading of kraft paper and large writing paper was also very active. In November, there were rumors that German paper mills were selling out, and the long-silent Scandinavian paper seized the opportunity to move. However, the supply of Scandinavian paper was very weak, so the prices in late November and early December soared. Reel paper rose to about £12 per ton, which was 50% higher than the price of £8 per ton at the beginning of the year. Although paper merchants were willing to pay an additional 20 shillings or more based on the listed price for large writing paper and kraft paper, they still could not purchase them. Because of the high prices in November and December, most paper merchants with inventory made a lot of profit. The Xi'an Incident in mid-December gave the paper industry a bucket of cold water. During the thirteen days of the evolution of the situation, the price of paper in Shanghai almost fell. However, after the problem was solved, it immediately recovered its original prosperity.</p>
<p>Looking back on the past year, Germany ranked first in the foreign paper consumed by China. There were no changes in the customs tax on paper throughout the year. In November, using the Boxer Indemnity, preparations began in Shanghai to set up a foreign-managed paper mill. Due to the low value of raw materials and the high price of paper, its future development is bound to be predictable. The plan to set up a paper mill in Wenzhou is still stalled. The proposal to set up a paper mill in Guangzhou cannot be implemented in the near future. (End)</p>

<p>Reading Notes</p>
<h3>Tanizaki's "Love and Eroticism"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>Women Are the Keynote of Western Pure Literature</p>
<p>Oriental Women Lack Eternal Sublimity</p>
<p>Quail Snipe Miscellany is a recent collection of essays by Junichiro Tanizaki, which is a collection of essays and essays that have been published in the Central Public Opinion, including love and eroticism, In Praise of Shadows, Osaka and Osaka People I have Seen, Memories of Tokyo, Afterword of Shunkinsho, My Poor Story, Youth Story, etc. Among them, love and eroticism can be said to be Tanizaki's comments on the characteristics and culture of the East and the West.</p>
<p>In Love and Eroticism, Tanizaki vaguely regards Western pure literature as something that inevitably deals with the love between men and women. Those novels with animals or adventures in society as the subject matter are regarded as impure literature; it is said that oriental writing seems to be trying to avoid the involvement of women and men. For example, Li Bai's "Emei Mountain Moon Half Wheel Autumn, Shadow Enters Pingqiang River Flow, Send Clean Creek to the Three Gorges at Night, Thinking of You I Can't See Under Yuzhou." The Thinking of You I Can't See in this poem seems to refer to the bright moon on the surface, but from the words Emei Mountain Moon, it faintly implies the place of lovers; he explained that oriental aristocratic literature that can enter the hall of elegance is not necessarily like Western literature, which inevitably takes the relationship between men and women as the subject matter, even if there is one, it is vaguely invisible, which is entirely due to the constraints of classics and old etiquette. However, in the literature of the Heian Dynasty, such as The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, The Tale of Genji, etc., respect women considerably, and the latter is specifically based on the involvement of men and women.</p>
<p>The writing of the Kamakura period after the Heian period rarely took the love story of men and women as the subject matter, but in the Tokugawa period (Edo period), like Saikaku's "Amorous Objects" and Chikamatsu's "Double Suicide Story", they broke out, but those works that dealt with the love story of men and women as the subject matter were regarded as a kind of play and low-level products at that time, just like the "Ukiyo-e" that can best express the appearance of the world in painting art was ignored by the upper class at that time. The women who appear in these works often depict them completely as the opposite of "eternal", "sublime" and "sacred", and men stand above women; this can be said to be different from the works of the Heian Dynasty; Tanizaki's explanation of the characteristics of the Heian Dynasty's worship of women is quite consistent with the spirit of Western works. In Western works, men regard their lovers as the Virgin Mary, the appearance of "eternal woman". The root cause of this concept is the influence of body and climate.</p>
<p>Oriental literature (except for the special case of the Heian Dynasty) cannot sing praises of women in the same way as Western writing. This is really because the beauty of oriental women and men's physical strength are inferior to those in the West. The golden age of oriental women is their virgin era. After a few years, they lose their ability to charm and even bewitch. However, Western women reach the peak of their beauty at about 31 or 12 years old after marriage. Therefore, in the durability of this physical beauty, Western women have a kind of sublime spirit; therefore, the West has the so-called "sacred prostitute" or "promiscuous chaste woman". This type does not exist in Japan. Japanese women immediately lose the health and elegance of a virgin after contacting men, and their complexion and posture are also weakened, becoming as vulgar as a vulgar prostitute.</p>
<p>This place states the reason why women cannot be described as "eternal" and "sublime" in oriental works. At the same time, Tanizaki also said that because of the faintness of oriental men's sexual desire and lust - the nostalgia for women immediately arouses hatred after reaching the satisfaction of carnal desire - that situation also makes it impossible to sublimate women. This faintness of carnal desire, even Tokugawa Ieyasu, who had superhuman spirit and body (the ancestor of the Tokugawa family who controlled Japan for 300 years before the Meiji Restoration), was also like this. Tanizaki quoted Tokugawa's words: "Women should not sleep on the husband's bed for a long time. After intercourse, they should leave immediately in order to be deeply loved by the husband," which further proves the faintness of oriental men's carnal desire.</p>
<p>The above is Tanizaki's explanation of eroticism and love, but this kind of key that contains the denial of love in social relations and the status of men and women, and seeks its root source only in the physical body, is of course also close to "blindness." However, as an irrational observation confession of a writer, it makes it extremely easy for readers to understand the keynote of "eroticism and love" in Tanizaki's works to some extent.</p>
<h3>Sound News</h3>
<p>— He Jin</p>
<p>"I am not sad, I cannot cry,</p>
<p>All my memories are at rest;</p>
<p>I see the river become whiter and stranger,</p>
<p>All day and night I watch it move."</p>
<p>— E. Dow on</p>
<p>The winter night in Yuanluo is infinitely deep. I am tired of sleeping in bed - my heart is awake.</p>
<p>Cold! - Outside, there is no wind and no snow, the wilderness is silent, standing like a huge corpse - yet that cold! - The cold is stained with the lacquer black of mourning: the lamp is out; outside the window, there is no moon and no stars, I guess it must be another scary night.</p>
<p>I opened my stinging eyes and looked unswervingly into the boundless darkness - I felt that in the center of my heart, a star of dimly flickering embers was burning, this ember was breathing in the boundless darkness, making helpless swaying, using its bean-like fluorescence to laboriously illuminate the surrounding square inch of land...</p>
<p>Therefore, because of it, I was able to touch the boundary line between myself and the outside world; because of it, I knew that the darkness outside and I were originally two different individuals.</p>
<p>However, for no reason at all, a strange wave surged up, and I suffered from the Chu disease that was being dismembered - the tranquility in the vastness turned into infinite desolation, like a desolate beach after the tide. Just a minute ago, the azure sea that was circling with rhythmic eternal flow is now a barren dead field, stretching for thousands of miles with no one inhabited. There is only a barn owl in mourning clothes, flying horizontally and vertically, trampling on this lonely square inch of land; or a night traveler who hates life, violently knocking on a tombstone on a barren mound...</p>
<p>However, the surroundings are still a vast, helpless desolation!</p>
<p>I suspect that the sound news may be "death"...!</p>
<p>"Death!" I felt a burst of coldness, and I seemed to see a huge crystal-clear iceberg, a kind of water-like coldness passing through my limbs - for the first time I recognized serious sorrow from this. This time, what death gave me was no longer a kind of distant, dark threat; but a tragic and great appearance. I seem to be facing a kind and sincere gentleman. In front of him, people begin to have the determination to abandon their human essence and think about hurrying on the journey of life; and only in front of him can people have the courage to caress their own Chu pain. He teaches us to hold up the torch of life, so that we can put it down to rest. He endows us with the mood of high mountains and flowing water, and he also makes us imagine the drifting clouds in the high sky of an isolated island.</p>
<p>We walk side by side today.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we must</p>
<p>Say "Goodbye" to each other!</p>
<p>Tragic, solemn, the sound news is ringing like the tinkling bells of a fairy boy. I suspect that it is the language of nature, which is enough to take away the warmth of human gratitude.</p>
<p>We hold hands tightly today,</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will</p>
<p>Go our separate ways...</p>
<p>The sound - that sound news, rings.</p>
<p>I felt the heavy, impermanent footsteps, coming closer from afar, with busy silver bells tied to my feet, which gave off new, perceptible signals in between; I felt that in the road of life, I had come to a time when I should start running desperately - at that time, tears would not be enough to wash away my eternal regret, and laughter would not be enough to erase the Chu pain of my adulthood. The indescribable desolate sound news conveyed to me more and more silent words, and I listened to the silver bell from afar resolutely going away...</p>
<p>It was a night of no appeal. A little spark flickered in the middle of me, and I listened to him laboriously illuminating the surrounding square inch of land with his bean-like fluorescence.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>I hate the terrible days that pass too slowly,</p>
<p>I tear off the calendar fiercely,</p>
<p>One page after another thrown into the flames,</p>
<p>I want to tear out the tomorrow in my heart.</p>
<p>Three hundred and sixty days have been torn off,</p>
<p>Revealing a leaden-faced New Year's Day,</p>
<p>Darkness silted up the river of the tide,</p>
<p>I am lonely in the cheers.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Yearning</p>
<p>The Five Minutes of "Kissing Allowed" Overseas on New Year's Eve</p>
<p>Suddenly, I remembered that the last page of the desk calendar should be torn off.</p>
<p>"In this way, we can be considered to have passed the New Year!" My wife on the sickbed gave a bitter smile, and her deeply sunken cheeks, which had been humid for four months in the leaden twilight, twitched slightly, then subsided again.</p>
<p>Outside the room, I didn't hear the heavy dragging sound of the maid's slippers, nor the chattering of the Koreans in the next room. The entire "apartment" was bleak and desolate, like a desolate tomb.</p>
<p>"The shops will probably be closed for the New Year. Please go to Shinjuku and buy some small bread for me."</p>
<p>My wife—who has recently become like a spoiled child—choosing her dietary restrictions is a brain-racking problem for me. Fortunately, I got her automatic suggestion, so I ventured out to the most lively corner of the city, which we haven't visited for a long time.</p>
<p>The wide streets were suffocated by "full" pedestrians, goods, lights, and noise. The wind stopped here, and the weather in December was as warm as a greenhouse.</p>
<p>Buying and selling is everything, and everything is tonight. Thousands of faces are flushed with tense joy. The boom in military demand has risen to the point of bursting.</p>
<p>Many women are wearing heavy, old-fashioned high buns. Several new stalls have been added to wash hats. Vendors selling straw rope-like door decorations are extremely busy. People are really celebrating the New Year!</p>
<p>My feet moved inch by inch through the crowd and forest of goods like ants crawling. My eyes were dazed and confused, and my heart was blank. The excitement of rushing to the flower market in my hometown at the end of the year was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>After squeezing onto the train home and leaving the station, it was another world. The flat, round, dim yellow moon was plastered in the gray sky in the open space. The cylindrical signboard lantern, burning red like fire outside the "yakitori" tent, swayed in the needle-like cold wind, and the cloth tent also fluttered. However, there wasn't a single customer inside the tent. The sparse clatter of wooden sandals on the road was particularly clear.</p>
<p>When I returned home, my wife had already piled the quilt over her head and fallen asleep. The brazier was about to go out, and the apartment was still so desolate.</p>
<p>Originally, it was not easy for me to fall asleep, but tonight, with my eyes closed, I couldn't hold back the tide of memories even more.</p>
<p>Four years ago, I also spent New Year's Eve abroad—and in a café. Under the dazzling lights, in the net of thousands of colorful ribbons flying and intertwined, amidst the mixed laughter of foreign men and women, I, with a few boyfriends and their female companions, counted the moments with curiosity, waiting for the coming of the five minutes of "kissing allowed" in the dark.</p>
<p>The wall clock finally pointed to twelve o'clock, and the electric lights suddenly went out completely. The carnival dance music began to play, and countless dark shadows crowded, stumbled, and chased in the cellar-like darkness, filling, shaking, and bursting with wanton laughter and strange shouts. Even my companions squeezed into this dark chaos to join in the fun.</p>
<p>As soon as a song ended, the lights were immediately turned on again. The five minutes of "kissing allowed" had passed, and the New Year had tiptoed in in this darkness. The bells of the church outside kept ringing.</p>
<p>In the joyous occasion, I am always a calm observer, but at that time, I was burning in the fiery flames of ardent friendship. Even though one fantasy after another was shattered, I was still in the depths of fantasy.</p>
<p>The first New Year's Eve after returning to China was spent in Shanghai, also alone, also as a guest. After having dinner with the same friend in a Russian restaurant, we often wandered for a long time on the endlessly straight Avenue Joffre, which was brightly lit, and then returned together to the garret-like room where my friend was staying, which was like an ice cellar. We boiled a pot of tea and warmed our icy hands on the edge of the teapot. Because the thin cotton quilt could not withstand the all-night chill permeating from the cement floor, we also poured a glass of my friend's homemade bitter brandy as usual and drank it into our stomachs. Warmed and excited, we talked haphazardly for a while and spent the last moment of the year.</p>
<p>Yes, at that time, the iron reality had already forced its way in, but I was still deliberately constructing dreams of the future—legendary and magnificent dreams.</p>
<p>And now, it seems that everything is only for life, no, for mere existence in the simple sense, and only for current existence.</p>
<p>Even though I have not yet realized that I am old, the mottled bruises are clearly imprinted on my back and on my heart where the whip of life has passed.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is another year. But recently, I only dream of the past, dangerous, illusory, and delightful, heavily pressing on my past. Tonight—of course, I will still have such dreams, if I can fall asleep.</p>
<p>No wonder a few days ago, when I translated the last paragraph of Goethe's autobiography, I was startled, because he said what I wanted to say in my heart:</p>
<p>'Children, children! Do not continue to speak, the white colt of time, as if whipped by an invisible ghost, drags our destiny's light chariot to run past. We have no other way but to bravely calm down, firmly hold the reins, and steer the wheels now left, now right, dodging stones and avoiding cliffs. Where this chariot will eventually go, who knows? Where it came from, I can hardly remember!'</p>
<p>But in such a year, "dodging stones and avoiding cliffs" is not easy!</p>
<h3>Mother and Child</h3>

<p>Black as if a deep abyss,</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>From "Live Burial" to "Feeding to Dogs"</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>When I was in elementary school, I heard people say how bitter it was to be a subjugated people: for example, seven families shared a kitchen knife; if the master of the subjugated people was tired from walking, he could force the subjugated people to lie down and let the master sit on his body to rest, and so on, which was truly endless. But because I heard those descriptions of the painful suffering of the subjugated people, I was really very afraid in my little heart of this "major event" of being a subjugated people. And this kind of fear still exists and is expanding even now that I am an adult and grown up.</p>
<p>Originally, as long as you are obedient and docile, and act as a beast of burden for the master, and do not disobey the master's ideas in the slightest, then you may not be able to live comfortably as an "obedient citizen." But there are some people who refuse to do so. Perhaps they are fools who do not understand the times?</p>
<p>A telegram from Nanjing on the 7th contained such a shocking piece of news. Now, the author will take the trouble to transcribe it as follows:</p>
<p>Related parties expanded and frankly telegraphed: A major tragedy recently occurred in Weichang County, Jehol Province. Zhang Rongtang and other six people were recently subjected to the cruel torture of live burial by a certain military police force. It is said that Zhang is the son of Zhang Weicheng, a former member of the Jehol Provincial Assembly. He was recently suspected by a certain party and immediately arrested. More than 20 people were arrested. In addition to the six people who were buried alive, the fate of the others is unknown.</p>
<p>Zhang Rongtang and others were only "suspected by a certain party," so they were subjected to the cruel torture of live burial. This is really worrying for those who are willing to be beasts of burden for others. "Suspicion" has not yet reached the stage of "the truth coming to light." Therefore, when "the truth comes to light," the cruel torture of "feeding to dogs" will be carried out. For example, here is another piece of news to confirm this fact:</p>
<p>According to people from Liaoning, recently a female teacher from a certain school was caught by a certain party for privately communicating with the volunteer army. She was stripped of her clothes and driven into a courtyard with dozens of wolves and dogs, and was bitten to death alive.</p>
<p>Although "live burial" and "feeding to dogs" lead to death by different paths, and although they are both inhumane acts, it seems that they should no longer exist in the thirties of this twentieth century. However, the behemoths who turn the wheels of history backwards seem to need to use that kind of medieval torture to warn people. However, no matter how great the power of the behemoths of history is, it is still moving forward. Live burial and feeding to dogs are not enough to chill people's hearts!</p>
<p>The more people see that kind of inhumane act, the more resentment they feel. The more resentment they feel, the more they want to break the shackles of slaves, or struggle desperately to prevent the shackles of slaves from being put on their heads. Thus, the wheels of history continue to move forward!</p>
<p>And those who carry out cruel torture are giving people clear evidence that they are traitors to history and great enemies of human culture!</p>
<p>No matter how cruel the torture is, it will not scare people away. Fools who do not understand the times deserve to be subjected to that kind of torture, but outstanding people who understand the times are not necessarily safe for life! Because the master's "suspicion" can be suspected by the master at any time. You cannot rule the master and tell him not to suspect!</p>

<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Luo Qing</h3>
<p>— Zhi Fu</p>
<p>Braving the cold morning wind in the north, passing through so many mountain villages, rivers, barren sorghum fields, and narrow and tortuous sandy roads, it was not until the sun was at its zenith that they finally saw this commercial port full of lifelessness—Yingkou.</p>
<p>From early morning until now, they had quickened their pace and walked this long journey of fifty or sixty miles without any relaxation for more than five hours. The situation was simply no different from a rescue operation. When they found the pier to catch the boat, their four tired legs seemed to be almost detached from their bodies.</p>
<p>Luo Qing carried two small lead boxes and gradually approached the iron fence, patting the layers of frozen frost on his clothes as he walked. He was silent, squeezing past the gun racks of the soldiers, crouching his long head like a mountain mouse. After rounding two corners, he leaned close to his wife's ear and whispered:</p>
<p>"Yin! You can rest assured now!"</p>
<p>The wife stopped, leaning her whole body beside Luo Qing. Her sallow chin drooped, and she just nodded: "You, you go and buy the boat tickets earlier!"</p>
<p>Luo Qing sent her into the "passenger waiting room." His own thin and wilted figure gradually disappeared into the crowd.</p>
<p>This was in a foreign port, in a room filled with noisy voices.—The room was supported by cement and a tin roof. On the surrounding white walls, advertisements for "Rendan," "Ajinomoto," "Lao Du..." occupied large areas, attracting people's attention with their colorfulness. But she only glanced at them casually, then lowered her face and sat with a focused gaze.</p>
<p>Just then, a hoarse voice suddenly rang in her ear:</p>
<p>"Where are you going? Are you alone?"</p>
<p>"Shanghai——" She turned around from her silence and stood in front of four people wearing uniforms and carrying gun holsters. She was covered in sweat, and her legs were trembling as if they were going limp.</p>
<p>"Shanghai?" The tall one first looked her up and down, then tapped the two boxes lightly with something like an iron ruler: "There's a man traveling with you too, woman?"</p>
<p>"Man." Yin's heart pounded. Although she knew that there was no way to avoid their inspection, she lost her feigned courage when things came to a head and felt uneasy all over. She tried to suppress the flow of blood surging in her heart, but at this time she felt that she didn't have a shred of strength.</p>
<p>Watching them, they soon began to expertly inspect her with their hands and eyes. One box also burdened the same overturning and searching.</p>
<p>"Where did your man go? What does he do?"</p>
<p>"Going to buy boat tickets, he's a clerk at the bookstore."</p>
<p>"Bookstore?——" The tall one's eyes immediately widened a little, as if they were related to this occupation, and thought it necessary to interrogate in detail, so</p>
<p>"Where is the bookstore located? What's the boss's name?"</p>
<p>"Located on the west side of X-X Street, the boss's name is X-X-X."</p>
<p>"Where is he from? How old is he this year? Is he tall or short?..."</p>
<p>"This,——ask my man." Beforehand, she knew the trouble of this procedure, and they would practice in detail. But the bookstore she was talking about was only his job six years ago! And now, the couple were just refugees from the Northeast!</p>
<p>"Humph!" The shorter one rushed up and wrinkled his nose at her, saying, "Where are you from? Where are you going in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"We are all from X-X, going to my aunt's house in Shanghai."</p>
<p>"Where does your aunt live in Shanghai? How many people are there?"</p>
<p>"Lives in the X-X District of North Sichuan Road, about three or four people!"</p>
<p>"Say it definitely, say it!"</p>
<p>"Yes——it's four people."</p>
<p>"How bold! You don't know what kind of collusion you're in." The shorter one pointed at her, his wide mouth twitching.</p>
<p>Now, the four of them surrounded her even more, eight eyes blazing with fire, bathed in blood, almost swallowing this weak woman in one bite; they were furious, but sometimes smiles piled up on their fleshy faces, but the sound of laughter that came out was like countless sharp knives stabbing her panicked heart.</p>
<p>"When is your man coming back? The high-pitched voice sounded again.</p>
<p>"Coming soon."</p>
<p>Turning back those words, she used her hand to pull away a bunch of messy hair that was covering her forehead, this time——but changed to a seemingly careless attitude, putting those velvet rope balls, clothes, and messy books, in front of their fierce gazes, she very calmly stacked them into the box. But in her mind, it suddenly seemed that her husband was naked, tied to a wooden post, being whipped, pricked with needles, and interrogated with severe mouths... scenes of terror flickered before her eyes.</p>
<p>Ten minutes passed, Luo Qing came back with the tickets. He, too, was subjected to an hour of extremely severe questioning, and even his clothes were stripped off for a thorough inspection: but in the end, nothing was found that could make them suspicious!</p>
<p>"Let you go. Dog!"</p>
<p>Finally enduring this scolding, they were fortunate enough to throw off the heavy leaden soil in their hearts and leave them to board the ship's deck.</p>
<p>After a long time, the wife turned her smiling face and looked at the vast sea; on one side of the sea was their sweet hometown.</p>
<h3>Three Sketches</h3>
<p>— Jia Yi</p>
<p>Winter Night</p>
<p>Isn't the house just a refrigerator? I'm like a fish with glazed eyes, unable to move!</p>
<p>The white walls, glass, books, and pens are peeling off their paint... I feel cold and icy; the only light is so weak and eerie! Is it a hell of wandering souls?</p>
<p>The stars are trembling in the high sky, as if they are about to fall. Aren't the few withered leaves on the treetops sobbing? All around me is the grief of a person dying. There are strands of telling everywhere!</p>
<p>The hawking in the street vomits out a stream of warmth from his heart—it's such a pitiful wail! From that sound, I dream of a haggard shadow shivering with a lonely lamp. The dog's bark continues weakly and slowly, further forming the desolation of this night.</p>
<p>The rumbling night train crawls across this black and desolate wilderness like a wounded beast, first with a hoarse wail. Long-distance travelers are having dangerous dreams:</p>
<p>Frozen thoughts gradually drift away; in the old house at the distant ends of the earth, I dream of an old man with hot tears hanging, and under the light of a solitary lamp, the yellow cat is still dozing...</p>
<p>Mother... home... hometown... child... discontinuous thoughts form a ball, then separate like a bundle of tangled hemp.</p>
<p>Five years. The night is long. The heart of a prisoner gnaws at the unbearable life!</p>
<p>Frosty Morning</p>
<p>The chimes of the chapel spread out in the cold air to this corner. The sound falls on the field of each person's painful repentance. The clear morning after waking from a dream floats up the difficult dream from last night!</p>
<p>Everything is still quiet. The desolate trees stand alone. Looking out from the window, there is a thin layer of frost powder on the low black tile backs and the fields. The frost powder eliminates all the chaotic demon atmosphere of the night, and the air now is as refreshing as a fresh flower after rain.</p>
<p>The blood-colored sun is blocked by the mist and does not filter down any light. People can only see a lump of coal without luster in the furnace in the east. But misty water vapor is steaming everywhere, and the earth seems to be a melting ice sea!</p>
<p>On a dirt road, I see some acquaintances: the old man pushing a vegetable cart to the market in the morning and the country woman wrapped in a headscarf carrying a shoulder pole. What a great occupation! From their lives, I feel the meaning and enthusiasm of life.</p>
<p>The Sun</p>
<p>We love the sun. The sun also loves us: it warms our hearts.</p>
<p>During the day, in a corner that can block the wind, in the bright field, there are many people accompanying the sun. It also caresses affectionately like a mother. I see a yellow flower under the fence smiling charmingly. Light and warmth stimulate all organic activity, and from activity, everything gains the loveliness of life.</p>
<p>When I was young, my mother put me in the winter sunshine to grow up. Now, I also put my children to sleep in the sun, so that they can absorb more warmth, and warmth is the power of all activity.</p>
<p>The sun shines over the mountains, shines on the green fields, and shines all over the earth: in its golden brilliance, everyone has the right to absorb its light and its breath as much as possible. Only it is the great mother of all, a furnace of love.</p>
<p>If there were no Mithras in the universe, there would be Ahriman on this earth. Hou Yi is dead, and we, the young people, want an eternally clear, quick, and cheerful sky.</p>
<h3>Illness</h3>
<p>— Yang Jiapeng</p>
<p>Birth, old age, illness, and death are the inevitable processes of life, and "illness" is especially close to "death," so people should pay attention to it if they are sick.</p>
<p>If a person does not know how to treat his illness at all, or takes medicine indiscriminately, then there is no hope of recovery! His life will also be in danger!</p>
<p>I say "taking medicine indiscriminately" because I feel that some people do not know how to carefully select medicines, but only listen to the name without asking about its content and efficacy. You must know that there are too many slippery medicines nowadays. How can you risk your life?</p>
<p>Therefore, sick people must not be greedy for cheapness and take shortcuts to buy unreliable medicines. But what should we do then? Now, the most accurate prescriptions and the finest preparations are of course only available at the Wuzhou Pharmacy.</p>
<h3>Red Eyes</h3>
<p>— Fuchen</p>
<p>"He's a red eye!" This is a recent expression people use to mock him.</p>
<p>Originally, his eyes were just sick, but in this cold weather, his eye disease became even worse, and his eye circles became itchy! His eyeballs turned red! It was truly "unaesthetic to look at."</p>
<p>He was afraid of being mocked by others, so he hid at home and didn't go out, but there was still suffering at home! When reading books and newspapers, his eyes felt sore, and he didn't know how to get rid of the obstacles on his eyes!</p>
<p>While he was suffering, someone suddenly told him that "Mingming Eye Drops" were very effective for treating all kinds of eye diseases, and advised him to go to the Wuzhou Pharmacy to buy a bottle to use; sure enough, after using it, his itching stopped, his redness disappeared, and even his previous eye diseases were cured.</p>
<p>Now, people no longer say "He's a red eye."</p>

<p>Light clouds and drizzle, the spring brew is rich. Cast aside idle worries and ascend to the Emerald Pavilion. The scenery is full of fragrant flowers and chirping birds. Suddenly, a pair of butterflies chase the fragrant dust. Fluttering like flower clusters. Rising and falling like birds entering the forest. It is, the wind settles and occasionally carries swallows. Playfully wanting to learn from dragonflies when splashing in the water. That Bao Yu is. Hand carrying a silk fan gently patting. Only to see, the green sleeves slightly fan, fragrant sweat drips. Crossing the nine bends of the painted gallery. Parting flowers and brushing willows, the more cautious. Just at the point of, wanting to capture but failing to reach, alas. Suddenly hearing, whispered words across the water. That Bao Yu is, always alert and able to feign change. Crossing Fragrant Bridge, but hesitating to retreat. Loudly calling Pin'er on purpose. It is, shifting the blame to Jiangdong, afraid of killing himself. Thank goodness he spared no effort.</p>

Plum blossoms are now designated as the national flower. The leader of a hundred flowers announces the new spring. Six-sided snowflakes foretell a bumper year. The talent of singing willows is unsurpassed in ancient and modern times. The most flourishing plums are in Dengwei and Chao Mountains. Severe cold in the northern country, snow always exists. Plum, pine, and bamboo are called the three friends. Delivering charcoal in the snow shows true feelings. Cao Aman. Remotely pointing to the plum forest, the crowd's thirst is quenched. Zhuge Liang. Heavy snow breaks the Qiang people. He Jing forcibly makes plum blossoms his wife. Sun Kang reads diligently by the light of snow. Consort Mei is banished from the palace. Snow blocks Zhongchen at Lan Guan. Heroes discuss with green plums and wine. Standing in the snow at Chengmen, rain is bestowed. The plum's nature is cold-resistant and called iron bone. Snow is like goose feathers, each piece true. The plum must concede three points of whiteness to the snow. The snow, however, loses to the plum a segment of fragrance. Plum blossoms bloom on the ridge in October. In the burning summer, snowfall brings the relief of injustice. The allusions of the plum are difficult to sing completely. The origins of the snow character are also difficult to pour out. A newly composed ballad of two or three voices of plum and snow.</p>

<h3>After Sounds</h3>
<p>Mr. Bao Mingshan, who previously taught harmonica music at Youlian Radio Station (frequency 880) from 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM every morning, has recently resigned from the station due to an increase in morning teaching duties and a lack of time to continue broadcasting. However, the director of the station, recognizing the program's popularity, personally visited the Universal Harmonica Association a few days ago to strongly persuade him to stay. Mr. Bao, unable to refuse the heartfelt request, has agreed to continue broadcasting the program every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM, starting next Monday (the 18th). The textbook used is "La Li Song" written by Bao Mingshan, composed by Xian Xinghai, and with lyrics by Wu Yonggang. It is a very tragic and inspiring song. Those who wish to obtain a copy should send a one-cent stamp (two cents for out-of-town) to (1) Feisheng Opera Society, No. 96, Lane 73, Bei Kai Commercial Road; (2) Jiaotong Radio Station, No. 137 Sassoon House, Bund, to be forwarded to the society; (3) Propaganda Department, Xinhua Film Company, No. 433 Edward Road, and it will be sent to you.</p>
<p>Those who wish to listen to the theme song record of Xinhua Film Company's "Soaring Ambition" should call 18228 at Jiaotong Radio Station or write to Feisheng Opera Society, and it will be played for the winter listeners.</p>
<p>The White Egret Opera Society has been established for four years. It was suspended for a few weeks due to the academic commitments of its members. A portion of the orchestra was reorganized into the White Egret Orchestra and participated in performances for various societies and groups. This spring, the society broadcast new songs by Ma Tinglong, which were very successful. Mr. Ma has now composed two new songs, "Autumn Red Leaves" and "Iron Blood Song," which are beautiful and moving. They are dedicated to comrades who love music and singing. Those who wish to obtain a copy should send a three-cent stamp. Singing groups should send a letter with a stamped cover and a half-cent stamp to Mr. Ma, No. 16, Lane 37, Remi Road, Shanghai.

Now there is another film, "The Secret History of a Female Doctor," Mary Stevems M. D. Films with female doctors as the theme seem rare. Although this film uses a female doctor as the theme, the main point is still love. The film tells the story of a female doctor who initially sees the matter of love between men and women very clearly. She enthusiastically advises others not to fall into the trap of love and find trouble. However, she herself later becomes a captive of love, and the pain she experiences is even more severe than that of other women. Katherine Francis is well-suited to play this kind of role, and it is indeed similar to "White-Clad Goddess of Mercy." The film will be shown at the Cathay Grand Theater starting today.</p>
<h3>"Eternal Smile" Opens</h3>
<p>"Eternal Smile" opens at the Jincheng Grand Theater today. This is Hu Die's representative work from 1936.</p>
<p>It expresses the sacred feelings of a singing girl on the Qinhuai River. She lives in a dark, ugly, and emotionless environment, with nowhere to place her depressed feelings. However, in a chance encounter, she discovers a great male soul, and she begins to endure and sacrifice for it. She pours out all her emotions and builds her comfort, but the cruel environment and cold laws ultimately do not allow her to be satisfied. In the end, she dies for that soul, but she is finally satisfied. Even in death, she dies with a beautiful and happy smile.</p>
<h3>Victor McLaglen's New Film "Iron-Blooded Hero" Released</h3>
<p>Since his performance in "The Informer," the big star Victor McLaglen has gained tremendous support from audiences for his straightforward style. He also received the Academy Award for that film. Now he stars in a new film, "Iron-Blooded Hero," playing a tough guy with unwavering loyalty, courage, and compassion. Later, he meets a beautiful woman and becomes infatuated and devastated. The indomitable spirit of a warrior succumbs to the charms of a beauty. The moving plot surpasses "The Informer." The film will be shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater starting today. Supporting actors include the beautiful British stars Peale Pearce and Keene Dickinson.</p>
