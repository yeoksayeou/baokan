<p>時評</p>
<h3>日議會的新形勢</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>日本第七十屆議會。再過兩天。又要在東京永田町新議事堂復會了今年正是日本實施憲政的第五十週年而這紀念憲政的新議事堂又費了十七年的時間。纔建築完成。在日本政民兩“旣成政黨”看來。這次議會應有特別的意義。他們頗欲乘這議會復會的時機對那為軍部勢力所左右的。</p>
<p>廣田內閣的施政方針。提出嚴厲的質問。藉作復興議會政治的手段。同時政府當局也在埋頭計劃應付方略。所以這次議會是很值得注意的。廣田內閣預備在這次議會提出的法案。多至百數十件。其中最重要而又會成為論戰中心的。要算增稅問題。去年十一月二十七日。廣田內閣僅以一小時餘時間的討論。一致可决了昭和十二年度的龐大預算案。歲出入總額達三十萬四千萬元。其中軍事預算達十四萬二千六百萬元。占歲出的百分之四七。而這大預算的來源。就以增稅收入。居重要部份。計二萬三千餘萬元。增稅的結果。自然一方面要引起物價的騰貴。使薪工生活者負担加重。購買力减退。另一方面又要影響出口貿易以至於工業。使經濟恐慌的深度增加。所以這一消息傳出以後。財界羣起反對。產業界也愁眉不展。最近大阪工商界要人片岡安栗木勇之助古川鐵紹郎等組織團體。以實爲資助“旣成政黨。”使其在出席議會的時候。能竭力反對政府增稅政策。政府方面。除將由馬塲藏相答覆政黨的質問。否認物價騰貴和增稅有關外。更凖備以強硬的。甚而至於解散議會的手段來實現其增稅計劃。</p>
<p>其次廣田內閣在外交上。又有許多弱點。授“旣成政黨”以進攻的機會。最重要的就是對蘇對華對英等等外交只能一味遷就。似乎有損東亞盟主的尊嚴雖然日蘇漁業和日澳通商談判已於去年年底獲得暫時妥恊辦法但成為縣案的日埃日印日荷通商交涉。依舊逗留在停頓狀態。廣田外交失敗的悲哀。究竟是無可掩飾了。所以旣成政黨勢必要抓住廣田內閣這方面弱點来鞭策一下。</p>
<p>“旣成政黨和政府的對文形勢。既如上述。廣田內閣在這次重開的議會中。究竟能否渡過難關。取得勝利。這大概是要以軍部的支持力量如何為斷的罷。</p>

<p>上午在倫敦舉行之海軍會議、未能達其對海軍軍備作量的限制之初步目的、與會之五强國中、英美法三國均允作某種限制、如主力艦以三萬五千噸為限、裝十六吋口徑之砲位等類、當時曾圖將砲位口徑規定以十四吋為限、但須加入華府海軍公約之各國於一九三七年四月一日前一律聲明願加遵守、始能有效、此點希望絕微、英政府現已與德國挪威瑞典丹麥荷蘭蘇俄諸國商訂單獨條約、包含倫敦海軍公約之主要條欵、惟大會當時、曾通過銷除建造新艦之驚人因素計盡矣、</p>
<p>今將海軍列强所已實行及所巳提出之造艦程序、審愼分析、可以略知世界海軍計盡之大槪、造艦程序、以英國者為最大、共列各類軍艦九十九艘、試閱下表、對於各主要海軍國、現時正在建造或已在計劃中之軍艦數額及種類、卽可略知其梗概、</p>
<p>英戰艦二艘、航空母艦三艘、驅逐領袖艦三艘、驅逐艦三十二艘、（其中巨型者十六艘）清水艇十三艘、小兵艦及掃雷艦十三艘、埋網艦•漁船•及魚雷艇共十七艘、共計九十九艘。</p>
<p>法戰艦三艘、（排水量三萬五千噸、載有十五吋口徑砲位者三艘、挑水量二萬六千噸、載有十三吋口徑砲位者一艘、）巡洋艦三艘、驅逐領袖艦二艘、小兵艦砲艦等十一艘、共計四十三艘、</p>
<p>德戰艦一艘、（排水量三萬五千噸、載有十四吋口徑砲位、）航全母艦二艘、重巡洋艦三艘、驅逐艦十二艘、大小潛艇九艘、掃雷艦十二艘、共計三十九艘、</p>

<p>日計劃建造之戰艦四艘、（大約為三萬五千噸級）航空母艦二艘、巡洋艦二艘、驅逐艦十四艘、潛水艇四艘、魚雷艇十二艘、共計三十八艘、</p>
<p>“乾恩氏之軍艦新刊”中、對於各外國之造艦程序、批評如下、“法國海軍建造工事、雖仍受勞工糾紛及他各種困難之阻礙、但一九三七年之新建造程序中擬次第興建之軍艦、總數不下四十艘左右、舊艦之被廢去者、較前增加、最著者為大戰前之戰艦“迪特羅”及“伏爾泰”兩號、德國則繼續循序進行其以新易舊之工作、美國海軍目下正努力於驅逐艦之建造、以便代替各廢艦之位置、美國潛艇之數目、已可為世界各國之冠、至於蘇俄方面之海軍、雖其海軍總司令聲言自一六三三年以來、蘇俄海軍之潛艇、已增加百分加百分之三○○、海岸防護艦增加百分之一七五、但實際上、並未見蘇俄有任何大批新建之艦艇、卽蘇俄最努力建造之潛艇、恐其所宣傳之數額、亦難免有誇張之處、</p>
<p>日本傳來消息之最堪注意者、殆為日政府已决議將按照一九三○年條約改為砲術練習艦之二萬六千噸之軍艦一艘改為戰艦、今雖無官塲明文微實此說、但似無理由不予置信也、又日本曾將戰艦一艘改造新式、觀其圖影、極為精緻、堪稱日本海軍工事非常之特點、英國新戰艦之設計、將於防禦空襲上作特別之設備、除裝十四吋口徑之砲位外、且備有飛機焉、英國新飛機母艦三艘、每艘排水量二萬二千噸、聞各能載飛機七十架云、（路透社）</p>

<p>富林德　通用汽車廠罷工工人　今日因資方違約、堅决拒絕如期撤退、其理由有三、卽㊀資方曾秘密通知加狄拉克廠工人於星期一到廠工作、此與資方允於正式談判前不開廠一層違反、㊁向非工會工人提議分別談判、㊂在各廠派駐衛兵禁止工人糾察、（十八日國民）</p>

<p>［莫斯科］關於禁止志願兵投效西班牙一項問題、英國政府前於本月十日提出新建議之後、蘇聯政府頃已送出復文、除訓令駐英大使邁斯基、送達英國外務部而外、并以一份、送交英國駐俄大使邱爾斯頓勛爵、此項復文、係用打字機打成兩張并由外交人民委員李維諾夫簽署、首述俄國駐英大使邁斯基、前於去年十二月四日將公函一件送致倫敦不干涉辦法調整委員會、主張各國現有所採行之不干涉政策、務當予以推廣、俾對於志願兵問題、亦得適用并主張、各國旣擬在西班牙海陸邊境、設置專員、監寮輸入該國之軍火、則志願兵之投效西國者、亦當責成該專員從專監察、邁斯基嗣於十二月二十九日又復提出備忘錄、內容係將蘇聯政府前此所接受各點、予以證實、并表示殷願調動正委員會確定日期、設立有效的監察辦法、此項日期、愈近愈妙、至是、復文乃謂、“就余所見、上述公文兩件、卽可以答復貴國所提照會、并與監寮辦法推行於志願兵與正式軍隊之議、相呼應也、“蘇聯政府、茲望調整委員會各會員國、立卽責成其駐在西班牙境內之代表、對於志願兵或正式軍隊之在西國登陸者、務當立卽予以監察、初不必等待西國叛軍當局在原則上贊成而後行之、“但禁止志願兵辦法、若由調整委員會任何一會員國、片面行之，而其他各國、並不接受約束、則非僅不能達到預期目的、且反將有利於西國叛軍、蘇聯政府、今茲提及此層、自屬義不容辭、“抑猶有進者、西國叛軍、對於監察辦法、截至目前為止、在原則上並未表示贊同之意、至於援助叛軍之某某國政府、對於設立監察辦法一層、旣無明確表示、對於各該國正式軍隊、美其名曰志願軍者之停止派往西國一項問題、亦復游移莫定、事實如是、然則採取禁止辦法、豈非時機未至歟、其結論謂、“蘇聯政府、目前並未派遺志願兵前往西班牙、但亦未便採取片面辦法、自行加以約束”云云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>結賬期限日近紗市局勢渙散</p>
<p>紗市平靜、局勢異常渙散、塲中成交殊清、故拍板時間甚短、大槪總結賬期限漸近、大都須要結束、多空兩方陣綫縮短矣、但同業心思多數觀小、因實需不振、雖證券高與金業商仍在多頭地位、終以大阪三品紗反動、跌風未戢、市價稍受牽制矣、</p>
<p>標紗二月獨半</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月一致下降、且跌風尤熾、良以三品紗步步下游、兼之同業中大都看小、於是市情甚弱惟二月期多方把持甚力、三盤以後、開現紗銷路尚不薄、浮空抵補而回升、結果二•四月比上日收盤價漲二•四角一•三月跌三•六角、午後開盤三品紗雖繼續下跌三•四元、市塲人心仍無變遷、塲內交易殊少、市價絕無進出、結果各月比上午收盤價回跌一•三•四角、查賣出賡豐四千八百五十包、通記七百包、裕康七百包、大豐千三百包、長餘一千一百五十包、仁豐一干○五十包•願大一千一百包、潤康一千○五十包、輻康六百五十包、益昶六百包買進吉豐六百五十包、恒益一千九百包、錦昌四百五十包、振大七百五十包、愼昌九百包、望泰與六百包、泰昌一千○五十包、長豐三千六百包、恊成七百包、大昶四百五十包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>期棉絕少生氣</p>
<p>棉市絕無榮辱可分、塲中情形極其散漫、多空兩方旣少生氣、並有袖手旁觀之勢、於是盤旋之力愈強也、同時現棉廠需呆頓、人心更難興奮也、</p>
<p>標花買賣觀望</p>
<p>標花前布開盤、因英印棉市俱見下落、大阪三品花來電亦跌、人心頗虛、各月下墮、但市價極其疲乏、毫無精彩可言也、結果各月比上日收盤價跌五分至一角、午後開盤、布况平靜、塲中買賣尤稀、市盤無大變化、結果一月比上午收盤價跌一角、二月漲一角半、遠期勿動、查賣出源大一千六百担、聚興一千担裕大一千三百担、大豐一千二百担、潤康一千八百担、大昶二千一百担、永大二千一百担、源興昌一千担、長和三千八百担、泰昌二千一百担、福康一千三百担、買進大孚一千八百担、明德一千一百担、愼昌一千一百担、長餘一千八百担、泰興二千七百担、生源三千一百担、同和一千百担、新昶一千一百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>現棉消費轉趨沉悶</p>
<p>現棉廠需停滯、來源財有姚花到一千九百五十包、通花一千五百九十包、</p>
<p>大阪現紗狂跌十七元</p>
<p>三品期紗亦跌七元八</p>
<p>十八日大阪電、現紗跌八至十七元、十六支扇面二百四十七元、跌十三元、二十支金焦二百六十七元、跌八元四十支五星四百元、跌十元、四十二支雉子三百九十八元、跌十七元、三品期紗跌五元至七元八角、近月爲二百六十七元、遠月為二百四十九元、期棉跌一角至八角、近月為七十三元八角、遠月為七十六元五角、</p>

<p>去年末上海各廠存紗統計</p>
<p>緼存量爲一萬六千六百三十七包</p>
<p>本埠華英日紗廠棉紗存量至上年年底截止、查日紗存量為一千○十六包、華英紗存量為一萬五千六百二十一包、合計一萬六千六百三十七包、比十一月底之六千一百三十八包、其中日紗增一百十六包、華英紗激增一萬○三百八十九包、合計大增一萬○四百九十九包、上海華商紗布交易所倉庫中存紗、十一月中僅剩一千○六十五包，至十二月底激增至七千九百四十包、其中十支反手粗纱有四千三百包二十支細紗有三千三百廿十包、十六支紗有二百四十也、茲將中外各廠存紗內容摘錄如下、（單位包）</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>府綢漂布價殊堅穩</p>
<p>細綫坯布原料缺乏　川粵山東積有添辦</p>
<p>昨日紗市機疲•綫價仍甚堅昂、根子奇缺、棉布市氣平和、白貨細布•細斜由本街批發荘及染廠吸進東貨本廠貨約過四百餘件、價大都做下每疋五分至七分半、粗布本掛需要清淡、而粵帮長江帮添辦較殷•天津帮亦有重磅貨進胃、且軍装十六磅組布有卽將發動之訊、市氣稍為振作、價亦趨穩定、惟淺色印花貨及春令府綱漂布均以缺乏原料細綫及坯布關係、西南路川粵長江等帮進意加濃、北路山東帮亦續有添辦、廠方新花樣翻出一批數十箱、四五天卽能銷完、存貨亦漸次走脫、價殊堅穩、客帮白貨走勢不佳、刻惟江西帮福建帮粵帮較爲生色迄無躉批交易、市盤因之趨軟云、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>五年來如一日上海生絲出口無進步</p>
<p>去年較前年减少一萬三千餘包</p>
<p>據實業部上海商品檢騐局報告、二十五年全年上海生絲出工總數為四一、四四六包、較二十四年减少一萬三千五百六十一包、與二十一年比僅增九百三十二一包、五年來如一日、華絲對外貿易之不振、可以想見、就最近兩年各種生絲言之、白廠絲之輸出、較二十四年减少五千餘包黃廠絲减一千七百餘包、緝里絲减二千三百餘包、其他各絲均减數百至千餘包不等、以運銷地點言、輸歐較前年减四千餘包•輸美較前年减六千餘、翰往亞洲及非洲則减三千餘包、茲將最近五年上海生絲出口數量這比較、及去年每月輸出統計分別列表如左、以供參考、（單位包）</p>
<p>外絲興奮後復歸平淡</p>
<p>昨日續演絲市、現期貨互有上落、然漲跌甚微、（計現貨漲五元期貿跌七元、）海外絲市邇來一度與奮後、境又見清淡、故昨日申市洋莊絲銷極靜、僅信孚有少數成交、印莊進胃亦似滿足、故亦無動靜用戶絲杭帮略有購進包額亦鮮、市盤則頗穩定、昨日共售出四○包、</p>
<p>英荷茶商再議限制產量</p>
<p>上年度世界紅茶產量據倫敦國際茶業總會估計依磅秤指數約共四千萬担、各國消費法美波蘭意種等國、均無重大出入、惟蘇聯銷路較往年大爲銳减、因此之故英倫市塲、紅茶存底尚多在商家之手、其中尤以印度茶爲多、現英國茶商、業已通知荷屬東印度、及爪哇茶商、對於本年度紅茶生產數量、再議嚴厲限制、聞對三四縣茶、决定禁止採摘俾產額可减百分之三十、藉得供求上之平衡、而維茶業基礎云、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>抵空與收買並起麵粉又見堅挺</p>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈一致回振之家、因洋麥報價、芝加哥加拿大雨處麥市參差、五月份因浮多了結獨軟、餘月皆漲、大衆買進、天氣不良、價目跌一二五至漲六二五、加拿大上落亦微、利物浦跌一便士零、當初開時人心仍見不穩、本月份開價初三元九角七分、惟連日慘落、空頭已思抵進卽廠家籌碼、亦陸續收回、故卽國漲至四元零零五厘、因此二月份開始、亦卽挺起四分、三四月份亦跟漲一二分、以後各盤近期則因抵空、遠期則業外續有收進、故又續好一二分、迫至下午開盤、因外行收買、雖續漲一二分不等、惟結賬已近，客帮未有暢吸、一部分浮多又有回脫、市氣遂又轉平、最後結局、祇較漲二三四分、至以近况而言、總須實銷活絡、市氣方能穩站云、</p>
<p>麥價午後為粉帶起</p>
<p>陳麥各好七八分</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面呈先跌後漲之象、開盤各月份交易尚暢、價則互有出人、本月份至四月份雖有一二三分之漲落六月份新麥、則人心甚軟、跌去五六分、迨至下午開盤、各月份均見反振頗烈、因粉市反動高昂、人心又為帶起、買氣一盛、近遠期均提漲七八分不等、不過人心雖好、趨勢並不嚴重耳、六月份新麥、較上午亦好五六分、與前週則無上落、現麥市面、尚見平穩、較前週喊起一三分、開蚌埠麥六元五角、江北麥六元四角、做開一萬餘包、由申大福新阜豐辦去云、</p>
<p>客秈去路以本街為大宗</p>
<p>昨日客米市况、仍居平軟、客秈機糙各米因粵銷停頓、本街不貪而來源不絕、貨主均主早日了結、南乃續呈疲軟無神、繼因機元米爲汕舉頭本街爭辦、數雖祇有一千多包、然在此沉寂中有此活動、市價立卽回好近角售開市價已與上週最高價相似矣、機糙各釉仍以清淡見疲、全日開出温爾米七百包、湘米九百二十六包赣米三千包消化以本街爲主、油顯次之、粵泉均祇點綴而巴。</p>

<h3>戰時的財政</h3>
<p>— 奚東曙</p>
<p>（續十三日報）</p>
<p>應艱於衣食住行的必需品，一切奢化物，不應再事享愛，財富稅，卽可将此剩餘的人力與財力，讓渡於政府，此種財富稅，如所得稅，造産稅，戰時利得稅等，往往利用累雖號，使人民損財好難，不依固定的成分，而依甚財力之最大的限度，因之政府得以確切的方法，獲得大量的收入，同時因徵税，减少人民的消耗，增加人民的生産，政府並未製造信用，單方的增添其購買力，故國家可以避免通貨與信用的膨脹，所以一般理財家，都主張戰時的稅收，應以直接的財富稅，為最合理化的主體税。</p>
<p>但政府徵收任何捐税，必須經過相當的手續，與若干時間，尤其是所採用之新的賦稅，譬如我國現在所頒佈的所得稅條例，必越若干時，方可有大宗的收入，統入國庫，當軍需孔亟的時候，决不龍以稅收短絀，而停止軍事，在這青接不接的期間，祇得採取募債的方法，可以立時收进太宗的欵項，而應急需，就是把未來稅收的零數，化為目前的整數面預先支用，公债的優點，就是在極短期間，可以凑集巨大的欵項，而将公债的負擔，加諸以後若干年內一般付稅人的身上，購買公債的人，目視寫一種投資，不覺其爲戰待的魚擔，卽一般人民，亦不至有若何　抗與怨懟，而政府亦可從春作本來加稅的計畫，但是舉債，實屬一時權宜之計，比較加稅，總是利少而害多，一般人以爲舉債沒有加增他們的負擔，所以也不减少其財物的消耗，同時可以坐車公債的利息，遂也不必努力於格外的工作，其結果，一以剝削國仙戰時可以利用的財物，一以減少現有的資本，并妨害後代經濟的繁榮，而應寡公債的人，往往不提事節儉，而乃利用銀行信用以爲週轉，這就造成信用的膨賬，促成物價的上漲，（未完）</p>

<h3>追懷唐有壬</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>唐有壬，於去歲十二月廿五日，為周年祭，溯自昔年，被暴徒狙擊，殞命於滬上，不禁為之悼措者久之，茲忽忽已一稔矣•爱追懷其幼時，及留東求學，一二軼事，書之於后。</p>
<p>當清光緒丁未歲，滬上三育學校，自梅福里遷至新閘樹浜橋左，新舍宏敞，學子負笈以肄業其間者，益衆。時執教鞭者，有吾邑汪指衡，上海王超人，王孟祿，楓涇蔡匹之，而愚亦與於其列。生徒中至今能記憶所及者，常熟翁之華，上海蔣氏保釐保廉，而有壬唐林，暨其弟唐沐，皆爲青年中之錚錚者。有壬為瀏陽唐才常之子，故汪指衡授國交，於民族主義，與革命史蹟之可取者，尤三致意焉。每一課講畢，必令有壬朗誦之。汪讀文音節宏亮，不同凡響，而有壬發音能肖之，同學中咸稱之為汪調，亦佳話也。</p>
<p>嗣，留學日本，入慶應大學，專攻政治經濟，寓東京萬田橋萬田町清水坊，相與往還者，吾邑徐雨青，（此君亦於前二年物化）潘公弼，及浙江戴克諧等。有壬課畢回寓，喜穿和服，擅日語，不知者固未識其為留東學子也。秉性習靜，而長於弈，雨青嘗與之對局，而弗能勝。有時引觥浮白，雖至漏夜，或竟頹然欲醉，而有千面無改容。閒談及祖國事，激烈者恒張脈奮興，幾於拍儿頓足，而有千曾不稍露辭色；蓋其胸藏蘊蓄，沈默之中，固非恒人所能窺耳。</p>
<h3>報業大王赫斯特</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>任何人知道美國的新聞事業，比世界各國來得發達。提起了美國的新聞事業，我們便立刻會聯想到美國的報業大王赫斯特，MR.Hearst的確他是美國新聞界的權威，他所經營的報館，有二十八家之多，滿佈了全美國。</p>
<p>赫斯特的從事新聞事業，歴時已有五十年之久，畢生的精力，完全用在新聞事業上。現在雖已垂暮之年，而他對於新聞事業的努力，還是不减於昔日。就是對於一個極徵細的問題，也什麽都知道，不拘對人對物，更都能處置得非常得當。</p>
<p>報紙上所發表的論文，計較重要一些的，都要由他看過一遍，簽了字，才可付印。所以不要說別的，就以簽字說來，他每天不知要簽多少呢。因此有人會懷疑到他自己發表的文章，或許是出於別人的手筆，祇簽了一個字，並不是自己寫的。其實凡是經他簽過字的作品，全是他親筆寫成。</p>
<p>赫斯特寫文章的時候，多半是在夜晚，因為白天他的事情很多，關於報館方面的組織問題，經濟問題，行政問題發行問題，廣告問題，印刷問題，乃至照片的刊印問題等等，事無巨細，都要由他一人取决。白天處理了那麽多事情，當然不再有時間去寫作；至於夜晚，比較甯靜一些，就是在他自己家裏，孩子們也都睡了，不再有所纏擾，確是寫作的最好時期。所以他在報紙上發表的文章，多半是夜晚寫成的。</p>
<p>他不但是一個有數的報人，在文學方面，也有相當的修養。因此現在他更預備抽出一部分的餘閒，寫幾部文學作品。</p>
<h3>兩位張公使</h3>
<p>— 眞相</p>
<p>四年前我曾在人物小誌這一角上，發表過一鑰“公使二張”，那時張乃燕任駐比公使，張歆海駐葡萄牙，委任狀才下，他們正準備行裝，出國榮膺新命。時間眞像電影一般，四年以後的“公使二張”，眞不勝令人有今昔之感了。</p>
<p>張乃燕在比利時鬧了一些很幽默的故事，外國報紙形容得實在不便翻譯成本國文字了。再等些日子，或者我們會另用一種絲毫不含攻擊作用的筆墨，輕描淡寫紀述下來，留為後人作殷鑑罷。</p>
<p>張歆海本來是外交部參事，原有相當的老練。所以，由葡萄牙轉為捷克公使，又兼波蘭公使。在專任波蘭公使時，張夫人韓湘玫女士，曾以演講小國文學，博得國際上一些美譽。他們夫婦在國內時，對於文學就很有研究，曾同時擔任中央大學外國文學系教授，很得學生的信仰。</p>
<p>張乃燕早回國了；張歆海最近也因案為張岳軍撤職，不久據說也要回國。繼任張歆海的是民元外交次長魏宸組。也有人說：張歆海被撤的原因，實在是代人受過，暫時他或許在海外尚可度著作生涯。他們夫婦在外國雜誌上常發表文字，每月收入很豐，不過揮霍也很厲害哩！</p>
<p>已經是個木人頭還要套上一個假面具</p>
<h3>我所知道的王瑗仲</h3>
<p>— 木木</p>
<p>王瑗伸是現任上海大夏大學文學院的教授，兼高等師師科國文系的主任。我在三年前，曾經受他兩年課，這兩年中，他從來沒有缺席一點鐘，亦沒有早退或遲到，缺席早退和遲到，是大學教授的摩登病，但他是不够摩登的。講書的時候，老是閉着眼，口中滔滔不絕的說着，口音是準國語，却非常宏亮。課堂裏一百多人，可說沒有一點兒的聲息，儻是一有了聲息，他馬上睜大了眼睛望着。有人問他為什么閉着眼，他說，平時看書太勞的緣故，並且說左宗棠也常常閉着眼的。所講的課程，就是最乾燥的，如經學之類，亦能引起興趣，因為他的典故特別多，常常引用着，尤其是熟於歷史。他上課寫札記，從不帶本子，就是千把多字，亦是靠記憶力的。有一天有一個同學問他秦代三十六郡名，他便絕不遲疑地寫出來。他的衣服很樸素，舉動很隨便，不大善於交際似的，但有人說他也穿過西裝，跳過舞的，我却不很相信。他還有一件特別的事，他從來沒有寫過一句白話文，也沒有寫過一個簡體字，但他自已說喜歡看近代人的小說，尤其是魯迅郭沫若。他的文章，特別古奧，有一次他替人做一篇傳，中間有往寗……著製……等幾句，我們看了，大家莫明其妙，後來方始曉得，是以前的願望和穿雨衣的意思，至今我還記着。字也多寫古體，充满着復古色彩，但他老是對人說，文字要通俗。這不是太矛盾了嗎？也許是替我們青年人說法，不得不如此罷。我近來所見的人物也不能算少，但是印象最深刻的要算是他了。（移酬援緩）</p>
<h3>蘇州的茶博士</h3>
<p>— 德鄰</p>
<p>茶博士，是個專門名字，絕對不是他具有髠于淳飲酒般的一斗亦醉，一石亦醉的茶量，或是他慣吃十多塊錢一兩的武彜茶葉，茶博上，實在是蘇州幽閒階級的特具榮銜。</p>
<p>他們日常的生活，整天自日上三竿，直到夕陽西墜，除掉了在家裏吃飯的時候，差不多都消磨在茶肆裏面，那麽到底蘇州的茶肆，是何等的引人入勝；流連忘返呢？這點，據一個戴着傳士榮銜的友人對我說：在蘇州的茶肆裏面，有着各種典型的人物，像落伍的商人，近花眼的冬烘，紈袴子弟的青年，說不定失意的軍人，和失意的政客，也有在裏面。（未完）</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回（黃花對憔悴秋心添愁　素帕寄緾绵奇文鑄錯）</p>
<p>最後，他終於是把意思想得了。在紙上寫着道：佛自然不敢當，花也，月也，雪也，亦非平常之人，所敢比擬，但心意已可感矣。寫完了，自己兩手棒着，斟酌了一番，覺得除了學國器的樣，上下都不落欵，沒有別的法子。因之把那張八行，作雙層折疊着，就放在中間抽屜裏，那封信的旁邊。本來那一封信，友梅可以拿了走的。但是拿到手上顚了兩顚之後，覺得不妥當了。信封上說的是知君，這知君不一定，就是江夢蘭於是依然把那封信放下，將抽屜關着。站起身來，便待要走。可是心裏頭第一個感想跟着上來。他抽屜裏稿件很多，隨便折一張稿子在災裏，他回來之後，怎樣會知道？於是，綏緩的坐下來，將手摸着右邊的臉，想了一想。究竟他心裏得意的事，他也很容易想法子，這就在身上摸出塊花綢手絹，在空中抖了兩抖，有一陣很濃厚的香氣，送到鼻子裏來，自己笑了一笑，拉開抽屜，把手絹就向裏面一寒。可是把手絹寒進去之後，立刻想到頗不妥當。這種作法，很容易讓人看去是失落在抽屜裏，不是故意放在抽屜裏的。於是把抽屜拉開，取出那手絹，折了個四方塊子，放在抽屜裏。在挷手絹下面，就是自己寫的那張字條，國器對於這手絹，能够驚訝一下的祈，這字條立刻就可以達到他眼睛裏去了。扶着桌子出了一會神，似乎還是感到不妥，這又第三次把抽屜打開，將那條花綢手絹的一隻角，緩緩的拖了出來，搭在抽屜口上，這一關抽屜，花綢手絹就有一部分在外面了。這樣安排妥當了，友梅走開桌子去幾步。偶然回過頭來，作個很不在意的樣子，果然的，那花綢手絹角，很顯然的看在眼裏把一百二十分不自在的心事，這算是安定了。到了房門口，再回頭看看，也就很高興的走去。他這種作法，用心良苦，總是很有效騐的。常這日下午四點鏡，國器由外面同來了。進房之後，先是不曾介意。後來到媽端了水進來告訴他，李小姐又來了。在書桌子邊坐了很久，寫了一張字條。國器說是寫了字條，這就向桌子上看去。見硯池移動了地方，一枝套着筆帽的筆，也架在硯也上。（一二四）</p>
<h3>段芝泉先生軼事</h3>
<p>— 合肥人</p>
<p>前執政段芝泉先生卒於滬邸，近已舉殯回平，敵備國葬。先生造共和，參加歐戰，與其當軍國重任數十年之豐功偉績，夫人皆能知而道之；茲特綴拾關於先生之遺聞軼事，爲人所未盡知者，以買本談：</p>
<p>先生合肥人，故宅在合肥西鄕西僑畔之陶崗，距城五十餘里。茅屋數椽，僅蔽風雨，在大蜀山紫蓬山之間，風景幽絕。先生貴顯後，家人屢請高其門閭，廣置田産，皆不許，其介弟弼鄕爲之稍置簿田並葺居廬而新之，然與合肥各世家之第宅相較，固猶弗如遠甚也。</p>
<p>先生有兩弟：仲曰弼卿，季曰子猷，仲鄕居務農，先生顯達後，猶荷鋤隴畔，與田夫野老為伍，遇之者，初不知其爲堂堂執政之介弟也。先生篤於手足之誼，仲每歲必省公，顧無所給與，每次祇贈川資五十元及家用二百元而已。仲居鄕，好爲人排難解紛，先生誡之曰：排難解紛周美事；我今貴，爾為親弟，理曲者，將飲爾之以勢凌之也。後勿復爾矣，其廉潔謙謹有如此。季隨公居北洋久稍習商務。與人合作營井陘煤礦，不特未以累公，且時以盈餘諮先生之匱乏焉。</p>
<p>先生少有大志，初投効銘軍—卽劉壯肅公之軍號—充某营哨書，旋因李文忠公創辦武備學堂，令各軍保送優秀子弟入學，先生隊以鍩軍之保送人堂肄業，是爲先生投身陸軍始。</p>
<p>先生在武備學堂，每試輒列前茅，時李文忠銳意創新軍，派學生赴德國留學，先生以成績卓越，資票穎異，與其選，以先生長於算事，遂習砲科，嘗在克虜卜砲廠實習數年，中國留德習砲學者，先生爲第一人去。</p>
<p>先生生平寡言笑，而氣凝重如由，雙目炯炯，如電炬，使人不敢平視，有諢號曰“歪鼻孜”然其平時鼻甚端，殊不稱其號，惟每當盛怒之前，鼻輙微斜，左右恒仰窺其鼻以覘其喜怒，無或爽，其諢號之由來蓋如此，先生又有諢號曰“齒鍋子”——天津方言謂背微隆之狀——则殊肖而人轉不之稱。</p>
<p>袁項城在北洋時代，先生與王士珍，馮國璋，皆出其門，時有北洋三傑之稱，又爲之語曰“北洋三傑龍虎狗”蓋指先生為虎，王為龍，馮爲狗，殊未料狗之地位轉在龍虎之上也。（馮曾任大總統，先生反臨時執政，王則並領袖滋味而未嘗也。）</p>
<p>先生平生以不植黨不營私自矢，故當軍國重任數十年，未嘗私鄕人故舊，雖親舊干求，祇助以金錢，而不假以職務，然頗偏慝其門下高足弟子，以為天下人材，皆已在吾門墙，是亦先生之一短也。</p>
<p>先生善弈，然不敵其長公予駿良，每今駿良侍弈：駿良勝，則訶之曰：他事不行，止會下棋。負則又訶曰：弈且不能精，况他事耶，駿良每待弈，恒戰慄不知所可。</p>
<p>先生遇危難，最鎮定，定國軍之役，東西兩路俱敗，直軍且迫城下，當時所謂安福系中人，如曾毓雋，李思浩，梁鴻志輩，皆紛紛匿居東交民巷日本兵營，先生獨兀居戶部街警備司令部，弈如常，左右勸投交瓦巷，怒斥之。然當時之叛將強藩，亦莫如之何也。</p>
<p>“九一八”之後，先生居天津私邸，一日有某國人請謁，面餽公金質紙烟夾一枚，啟視之，赫然有五十萬元之支票在焉，先生急正色授還，曰：君誤矣。文送客，未幾遂南來。故其卒於海上，國人莫不悲悼欽仰焉。</p>

<h3>法租界全體國藥號昨因反對苛捐罷市</h3>

<h3>擴大統一救國運動的展望</h3>
<p>吳市長在市府紀念周報告</p>
<p>本市市政府、於昨日上午九時、舉行擴大總理紀念週、由吳市長主席領導行禮、並有重要演說、題為“擴大統一救國運動的展望茲探錄演詞原文如下、</p>
<p>一•緒言</p>
<p>各位同志、今天所欲與各位同志說的、就是關於上海市文化界•教育界•及工商各界所發起的統一救國運動、其宣言已在前天報上發表想各位同志已經看到、今天就已此為題目、來說幾句話、</p>
<p>去年底十二月十二日、西安叛變及至委員長脫險回京的十幾天中、全國人民所表示的、一方面對西安叛徒一致的憤恨、一方面對於我們領袖一致的愛戴、有如對於領袖投了一次總信任票、這是中國自有歷史以來全國人民發揮民權的唯一表現、在政治上、實是一大進步、由於這一點、我們知道中華民族的前途、巳經到了一個有希望的階段、所以我在本年元旦、告訴上海市民說、中華民國二十六年是中華民族抬頭的第一年、中華民族抬頭的第一年就是有希望的第一年、但是我們在歷史上可以看到很多“功虧一簣”“事啟垂放”的先例、萬事往往剛剛在有希望時候、剛剛在要成功的時候而失敗了，所以我們對於中華民族的前途、旣知過有希望、我們更要小心謹愼更要努力奮鬥不要使此事“功虧一簣”“事敗垂成”其中最值得我們注意和努力的、就是統一、我們一方面要注意國內一切殘餘的惡勢力作最後掙扎、破壞統一、一方面要努力無論以如何代價、我們必須於根本上掃除統一的一切障礙、否則、中國眞正的統一、就是從實現、不統一民族就沒有復興的基礎民族不能復興、就不能救國、所以本市各人學校長•教授•各中小學校長•教职員•以及著作家•新聞記者•曁工商各界人士•有统一救國運動的發起、其宣言已見前日各報、統救國運動、在中國今日需要萬分迫急、而其意義亦甚為重要、統一救國運動成功、則中華民族復興、不幸而告朱敗、則中華民族滅亡、其關係重大、可想而知、全國人民當前的急務乃是解除國難、抵禦外侮、要解除國難、抵禦外侮、卽要充實國力、要充實國力、卽要重建國家、然而要建設一個什麽樣的國家呢、就是要建設一個三民主義的國家、如何去建設三民主義的國家呢、就是國民經濟建設運動與新生活運動</p>
<p>㊁統一的必要</p>
<p>統一就是救國、不統一不能救國、統一不統一的關係如此之大、統一障礙不掃除、眞正統一無從實現、因為殘餘軍閥各據一方、不服從政令軍令、各自為政、形成割據的局面、在如此情形下、人民的生活、受封建制度的壓榨、其疾苦日甚一日、求生之不邊、復有何餘力來貢獻給國家作救國運動呢、所以殘餘軍閥與封建餘孽都是統一的障礙、要實現眞正的統一、非根本加以肅演不可、要根本掃除這種障礙、並且要使這種障礙永遠不再發生、在積極方面、我們應該要有一個中心的思想、三民主義不是我們建國救國的中心思想不樹立中心思想、全國人民意志不統一、就不能建國救國、其次我們要從本位來努力、充實我們的力量、集合全國的力量、來作我們民族革命的武器、來完成我們民族革命的使命、統一的必要就在此、</p>
<p>㊂統一的可能</p>
<p>中國是世界上最大最古的一個文明國家、土地面積、有四百萬多方里、人口有四萬萬五千萬、估全世界人口四分之一、土地如此廣大的一個國家、人口如此衆多的一個民族、少數人或尚懷疑是否有統一的可能、此非別有懷抱必為喪失了自信力現在我們就下列幾點來看可以斷定中國的統一、不但是可能、而且是具有必然性的、</p>
<p>㊀就民族的質素來說</p>
<p>我們全國人民的血統。語言•文字•風俗•習慣　等均相同、雖有漢滿蒙回藏之分、但是差別日少、到現在利害相共休戚相關、實已無可分離所以總理曾說我們是漢滿蒙回藏五族成立的中華民族、</p>
<p>㊁就歷史的基礎來說</p>
<p>中國自秦朝廢封建制度以後、設立郡縣已經建立了統一國家的始基所以總理嘗說“中國向為一大統一的國家”、</p>
<p>㊂就民衆的心理來說</p>
<p>中國民衆無南無北、均無不能調和的意見、此爲與各國聯邦不同的特點、酷愛和平、渴望統一、實爲中國民衆的普遍的心理、孟子所说“天下烏平定、定於一”這種教訓、尤深入於中國民衆的心裏、具有確切的信仰、</p>
<p>㊃就時代的需要來說</p>
<p>中國國家的特點爲有組織的、能團結的、尤其十九世紀以來民族主義的發展、爲近代多數“民族國粗”建立之根據、以中華民族建設中華民國、深合於時代需要、</p>
<p>㊄就交通來說</p>
<p>中國自秦廢封建以後、雖然已粗具統一國家的雛形、但是因為國民經濟、正滯留在農業自給經濟時代、人民生活簡單、復因面積遼闊、交通艱難、故有古時不相往來之說現在則已大不相同、已進至工業互助經濟時代、交通日益發達、輪船鐵道公路航空等交通利器、已日漸完備、中國在秦朝已知需要統一、到現在要需要統一、不過從前的統一的方法、不適用於現代而已、</p>
<p>㊃統一的障礙</p>
<p>中國旣有統一的必要、又有統一的可能、但是潛伏於社會中人民思想中的障礙不掃除、雖有統一可能、而其正統一、還是不能實現、就算能統一、其統一的內容、還是不合乎現代國家的方法的、中國統一的障礙是什麽、在政治理論上、一•有聯省政治論、倡此論者、都為殘餘軍閥、封建餘孽企圖於近代國家組織之下、保持割據之局、此種軍閥、原為封建制度之殘餘產物、覇據地方、將地方人民及財政兵權等、一切據為己有、魚肉人民、為所欲爲、如果國家一且眞正統一、彼等感覺於自身不利、故雖到了末路窮途、還想作最後的掙扎、假借名義、以圖反抗中央、二•有階級鬥爭論、倡此論奢為國際共產黨、以勞動階級爭奪政權之工具、在資本主義國家、產業發達的社會裏、勞動羣衆、受資本主義的壓迫與榨取、為謀解除其痛苦、或者有階級鬥爭的需要、但中是國非資本主義的國家、産業不發達、斷沒有階級鬥爭的必要、何况現在資本主義國家、及產業發達的社會、以階級鬥爭的手段、仍達不到解除勞動羣衆痛苦的目的、所以已由階級鬥爭、而轉向於勞資合作、中國現在雖然地大物博、有無盡之實藏、但十九還沒有開展正須要龐大的資本、來開發這無盡藏的資源、以裕民生所以我們現在一方面要獎勵投資、一方面要預防資本發達之害、所以總理要節制資本、總理說中國並沒有大富、祇有大貧小貧、我們祇要獎勵勞資合作、無須階級鬥爭、階級鬥爭、反足以分散民族的力量、破壞國家的統一、三•有人民陣綫率、倡此論者、也是國際共產黨、國際共產黨之所以倡此說者、為謀緩和世界各國反共產國際的空氣、又為國際共産黨在各國作政治策動的烟幕彈、西班牙遭世界空前的慘殺，至今末熄、這就是赤黑兩主義所給予我們的一個大教訓、在中國唱此說者、無非欲使人民與政府分離、破壞人民與政府通力合作的救國建國的聯合陣綫、故人民陣綫、在中國今日、實爲自殺之說也、至於那無恥的漢奸們、妄圖依府外力不惜賣國求榮、那就根本談不到理論了、</p>
<p>㊄統一的途徑</p>
<p>中國統一的途徑有四：</p>
<p>㊀恢復民族自信力</p>
<p>要恢復全國人民的民族自信力、在消積方面應信念中國有幾千年的光榮歷史、我們祖先對世界文明貢獻極大、我們中華民族、决不會滅亡、在積極方面、我們愛信念中國人的智識能力、並以挽救當前的國難、足以建立一個近代的新中國如果要這樣、則先要發揚民族意識、篤信自力更生、</p>
<p>㊁確立中心思想</p>
<p>我們要使全國人民一致信仰三民主義爲最切合國情的救國主義、來確立適應環境的救國理論、對於其他似是而非的或荒謬絕倫的議論、絕不為所搖惑、</p>
<p>㊂發展經濟建設</p>
<p>近代歐美各國政治的演進、據法國歷史學家西諾巴（Scignobos）說、就是物質建設與進步的結果、所以我們如果要與歐美各國今日的富强、就要求國家的進步與謀物質的建設、但要求國家的進步與物質的建設、非以整個國家統一的力量、大規模的進行不為功、國民經濟建設運動、就是一個有利於國計民生的建設運動、不但可以鞏固統一、而且可以使統一的國家適合於民族生存與人民生活向上的需要、</p>
<p>㊃擁謹最高領袖</p>
<p>我們從中外古今歷史上看、一個民族之興、决非偶然的事、矣有一個全民族所擁戴的領袖在那裏運用全民族的力量、來興民族建國家、然後民族得以興盛、國家得以建立、我國今日很慶幸、已有了一個全國人民總投信任票的最高領袖、從此我們祇要竭誠擁戴這個最高的領袖、以我們一己所有的力量與自由、都貢獻給國家、使我們的最高領袖、可以自由運用我們整個的力量來建立國家復興民族當前的國難、於不久的將來就可望解除、國難一解除、我們的國家、才可以達到歐美各國今日富强的境地、</p>
<p>總之、上海市各界人士所發起的統一救國運動、是有極重要的意義的、希望上海市三百五十萬市民、一致奮起參加這個運動、並希望將此運動擴大及於全國、來制裁破壞統一的一切殘餘惡勢力、鞏固統一、這就是目前救國的要圖、</p>

<h3>薛香姐案續訊車夫瀝陳往事</h3>
<p>言曖昧行為僕役皆知　香姐曾否生育待研訊</p>
<p>已故顔料巨商薛寶潤之女薛香姐、自嫁地產商許良臣為室後、同居於麥特赫司脫路一○六弄二號、近有十八歲蘇州青年王根寶（家住白爾路仁元里十一號）由其父王永泉為法定代理人、延陳文律師、具狀在特一院民庭、對許薛氏提起確認親子之訴、緣王永泉前在薛寶潤家</p>
<p>為汽車夫</p>
<p>時、與薛香姐有染、珠胎暗結、為避耳目計、乃賃屋北山西路泰安里二九二號暫作生產之所、在民國八年二月十二日、誕生一子、名根寶、其取名之意義、卽寓有根基於外祖寶潤公也，嗣薛香姐自適許良臣後、從此侯門似海難予會面、雖致函薛氏、要求認領、</p>
<p>均置不理</p>
<p>因此起訴云云、此案業經特院一度傳訊各情、已誌本報昨晨、由徐推事蒞民七庭續訊、被告薛香姐未到、延鄂森•唐愼培•兩律師到案、卽據原告律師陳文起稱、上次奉庭諭查傳證人、但北山西路之二房東現適離滬返鄕、尚有穩婆、則未查到、繼據原告王永泉投稱、在民國六年三月間、在薜家爲汽車夫、至翌年五月間辭退、我當在薛家時四五日後、卽與薛香姐</p>
<p>發生關係</p>
<p>不久薛氏懷孕、為避人耳目計租屋於北山西路泰安里二九二號樓上、二房東爲徐姓、月租八元、在民八二月十二生一子、卽根寶、薛氏迨產後三四天、乘車回家、面我扔居該處約三年、暗中時相往返、我每當夜間卽至薛家、因其門外祇有極短之圍墙、故必</p>
<p>越牆而入</p>
<p>直達薛氏之閨房、及後薜家在後面另造新屋、香姐之臥室亦遷移、我不能前去、曾由薛氏致函於我、告明入室之途徑、直至某年九月十二日、薛氏因須在一品香出閣、在事前我乃致電與氏、相約在永安公司傢私部談話、薛氏向我哭泣、謂彼現須出閣、卽</p>
<p>餽五百金</p>
<p>從此不相謀面、但此種曖昧行為、薛家舊日之僕役•馬夫•花匠•等、均屬知悉云云、繼據原告代理陳文律師起面請求飭傳被告親自到案、謂本案因相隔日久、致證據證人、調查不易、但面貌血簇等等、均可鑑定、况據原告所知、薛香姐在產生根寶之前、亦曾懷孕、且</p>
<p>屬雙包胎</p>
<p>由原告親自用藥草代為打去云云、被告律師鄂森•唐愼培起而否認原告所控種種事實、謂被告極願親自到案、祇因本案原告所控、非但證據毫無、抑且全屬子虛、本辯護人可以</p>
<p>負責聲明</p>

<h3>由衛生行政機構改革談到所謂中西醫問題（下）</h3>
<p>— 花新人</p>
<p>我們對於未來的全民保健的衛生前途雖不敢輕斷，但深信總不至“不歸中卽歸西”的趨於極端，而又必抵於非根本推翻科學醫的旣仔，成再略滲非科學醫力量的妥恊底側中途徑，因為按目前國內現實衛生基礎來說是只能容一元的獨斷而不能容多元的摩擦，所以根本用不着去緩衝諸勢力，但揆諸衛生行政性質而言，目前工作仍應一貫澈底的做下去，而不可因着他人倡議改革卽慨括模稜下去，所謂暗淡的雲霧總有一天可以放射出日月的光輝來，值茲二十六年首我有三點意見提供：</p>
<p>（甲）衛生行政應合乎國情—所謂量布裁衣量米造飯，應視個體力量而行德日方式未必可行之於國內，英美辦法未必又合乎國情，擷精取華滲合國粹用最平實之方式去發展工作，當有事半功倍之效。近幾年來衛生工作得能暢利進行博得民衆信仰者，雖謂負責有人，計劃精密，但“合乎國情”還這一重要原因，試觀各診療所各鄕村衛生指導員均能應用所學施之於人比種下級幹部人員自後當力加擴充，目前衛生行政最高當局應明瞭現階段民衆對於衛生工作所發生之期望心是較昔日濃厚，進一步更當創設一維擊向心力之衛生制度來推進工作方不負民衆之期望，有人指摘衛生署長兼職太多，故有些次倡議改革之實行，一人兼職太多，，雖謂賢者多勞，然疏忽之處必甚多，此亦不合為政之道，更不合治理，故最好宜愼選精幹負一而專責的人才，然後職守明，付託專，人人能盡共職，能忠於事，則决無貪汚凟職之事發生，再對於本身職權底限度亦應認清，則决無越爼代庖之弊端發生（有人指摘此次醫師甄別考試應由考試院主持）希望衛生行政當局應採用合乎國情之計畫，方可免除內在的矛盾，也再不會受人指摘。</p>
<p>（乙）增進中醫的科學化，中醫的科學化，間接可以增厚衛生行政基礎的效率，直接可以提高國醫的地位，假若是走上合科學的路上，在學術的水凖上纔有平衡的可能，所以今後負有衛生行政專責者應以促進中醫科學化為努力的中心，否則就是行政機構改革實現對於整個事業亦將受到鉅大之打擊，根據事實來說，人類是競爭的動物，人類社會亦為競爭的社會，沒有競爭，就沒有人類的生存，沒有人類的進步，競爭的結果是適者生存是優勝劣敗，所以在這裏我們證實了個人的成敗民族的盛衰國家的盛亡，都是建設在競爭的形熊上，日本漢醫的落伍也就是因爲失去了競爭的原素，所以在衛生行政機構未改革前，促進國醫的科學化是目前迫切需要的，而對於行政機構改革問題是當加以充份的考慮，要是仍斤斤於講求目前的對策而忽路了百年大計，便是不忠於國家的負托。</p>
<p>（丙）增設研究部—吾國衛生行政多着重於西醫這也是增加中醫反對的主因情勢來論斷、行政機構的改革是絕對不可能的，卽令有一部份人主持改革决心堅持，其結果也不過是促動中西醫的權利爭奪而致衛生行政內部的崩潰，因爲有這原因，所以國醫研究部的設立是調整這種紛爭的原則，研究部內可以羅致國醫碩彥共同研究，將國醫國藥用合科學的方法去發揚光大，使中國固有的國粹—治療藥劑、能成爲一種適用合科學化的東西，同時我們也可以打破“中學爲體西學為用，”和“中醫善於治內科，西醫精於治外科”的傳統矛盾封建思想，所以在學術的立塲，我們不妨作開誠佈公的商討，在學術競爭的立塲我們不要放棄了責任，因此我深信假若眼光專着重於地位勢力和人事方面，去競爭，而放棄學術的研究，則對於事業是無補益的，目前我們所需要的是公醫建設定减低死亡率是增進全民族的健康而不是互相鬧爭傾軋標榜，所以我們要完成這種工作，只有站在醫畫建設的旗幟下互相親善，共存共榮的來爲人類謀幸福爲社會謀福利，我想總比較作權利的爭奪來倡議衛生行政機構改革來得好一點。</p>
<p>上面三點是很平易的期望，現在並不是我們空言可成就事業的時期，而是要以實力來表示的時代，衛生事業是任重道遠，必須脚踏實地埋頭苦幹也决不是投機取巧僥險徼倖所能收效，所以今後我們應避去浮囂的空論，要注意着實際的建設，最後希望國內中西醫界能多産生幾位巴士德，冉那，李士待和古霍Koob總比較空言改革來得有效率。</p>
<h3>談癌（三）</h3>
<p>— 卒小</p>
<p>癌是著名的羅司氏雞肉腫。Rouscbe　Sarkom。可是這種雞的肉腫，雖然能够累代接種，（用的是肉腫的濾過液）而一則這種接種的産物，在培養時呈著異態，不跟其他癌細胞一樣，二則Rous雞肉腫，只是惡性疤腫類中一種，不能普遍的應用。還有，普通傳染病都引起發炎性的反應組織國，何以這裏却只是瘤腫的形成，也是不可解疑問。至於寄生蟲或植物，在癌細胞裏的發見，圖說很多，經過仔細的檢查後，知道這種染色標本內所見的東西，無非是所謂細胞內蓄物。是成形體內變質物。不過形態有些像寄生物罷了！</p>
<p>關於刺激的理論，也有相當的事實助證，例如白蠟廠工人的癌腫，吸板烟老槍的口唇席腫等等，最有力的實證，為日本人山極氏在歐洲留學時代所浩成的柏油癌腫，他用柏Teer油不厭不倦地，天天塗抹在兔子的耳朶上，這裏的皮膚，經過五十五至三百日的持久的刺激，便會先行發生角質增殖，乳嘴狀瘤腫，而再長成眞眞的癌腫。此中的主因，當然是直接物埋的，簡接化學的作用，當時便自有人疑心到也許是栢油中有一種特殊的化學物質，能够引起癌腫，但是沒有找到，聽說現在已經有人分析出來，但據我人所知，則不是單單栢油一物，可以造癌，卽洋紅Eosin蘇洞SudanⅢ白蠟Paraffin等都有同樣的效用，所以，栢油卽使可以造癌，造成者也不過是癌中一種，（毒性較輕）但跟他同等的化學物質，也有同等效用，由此推測，栢油癌腫，只證明了長期的刺激，有形成癌腫的能力不能遽引伸爲癌腫普遍的成因。卽使已經分析出來的物質，是成癌的主因物，也只是一種癌的主因，卽博思氏Borst　所稱之類似癌腫Cacinoid是也，栢油癌腫的成功，如於由極氏Jamagiva一九一四。這個試騐的成功，常時頗震驚一時，至今還在不斷的研究，雖然還不能够達到他原來的意圖，可是他的功蹟，已到不可磨滅之境。因為學者們在研究癌腫的工作中，若欲得到隨手可得，百試無爽的人工癌腫，當以此法為最有把握，而且可以看他一步一步的形成，所以更加可貴。在觀測癌腫進化及形成時程序工作中，栢油癌腫實予我人以寶貴的工具。</p>
<p>最後是博司Borst的見解了，他排除一切。摭住細胞本體，憑着種種解剖，病理解剖，胚胎學上，生理學上的智識。認為癌腫的形成，還是細胞本身的，一種異於尋常，在病理學上旣知的變化。靜因當然是所謂素質Dispcsition，動因則不一致。癌腫的形成，原也是一種補充性的反應，但是因為他本身有無限制的自主的生長能力，不循常軌，不守中樞命令，所以結果是尾大不掉，養癰成患，一變而為侵蝕器官敗壤身體的組織。正如老人亂命，本意雖不差，而力量與理智已不逮，每每於事無補，皮而有害。這種見解，雖然似乎帶些辯論的色彩，但是拿客觀的眼光來看，比較最為近戸而合理。</p>
<p>現在輪到怎樣會長癌的問題了，根據各種病原理論的觀察，醫家臨床的觀察，與研究室的動物實騐的例子，和經騐。我人可以說，癌腫形成的初步，不問其動因何若，必先有被癌腫侵發地本身組織質的不健全或衰敗的變動，先天笥的素因，當然也作一樣觀，包含在裏面。就用例來說，久病的損傷，持久的刺激等等，譬如一個久年的胃潰瘍，後來可變成胃癌的出發點。（現在的病理學家不談胃潰瘍而說潰瘍素質了）！硬化的肝臟，可成為肝癌的策源地。可是硬化是硬化，肝癌是肝癌，並且還有眞性與膽管肝癌的分別，讀者的一部份，千還莫誤為一談！！還有一件有趣味的實騐，是Doderlein報告，用膽脂Cholesterin　飼養的動物，有百分之四十，具着易發而强烈的人工癌腫的效率，這也可算是身體因為受了特殊勞養而起的新陳代謝功能，有使細胞受損，易具癌腫形成的伏因的可能性，在人種中，就歐洲的統計說，猶太種生癌最多。文化落伍的人種則較少。男女二性間，女的較多。尤其是乳及生殖器部份佔大多數。消化系器官的癌腫，則東方較多。肝癌更是中日二國內不希有的病症。（長與氏統計）就人的年齡言，患癌腫者，大都在五六十歲時，或以後，三十左右的最少。（肉腫則有之），但這並不是金科玉律，初生的小孩，也有患癌症的例子呢！本來嚴格地說，眞正健康的身體組合，在人類中只佔着少數，有着不可見的缺憾的，反在多數，這裏面癌腫的素因，當然也不少了！何怪癌的産生這樣的普遍而不息呢！</p>
<p>癌的種類，旣大別之為腺質癌，與上皮痛。則凡能長癌的地方，都由着這二個目標說明了。皮膚，各種管道，腸胃，肝胰，子宮，卵巢攝護腺，口唇，是此中最多而顯明的患癌部份。</p>

<h3>上海貧民庇寒所的醫事問題</h3>
<p>— 李彩華</p>
<p>關於貧民庇寒所的眞情，以及貧民在庇寒所裏的生活，我已另作訪問記在本報一月十二日本埠增刊發表過。這裏恕略。</p>
<p>我總覺得不論慈善事業也好，社會辜業也好，祇要有人的存在，醫事問題總是有相當重要的；因爲缺少了它，慈善事業似乎覺得美中不足；社會事業也不免有些功虧一匱”。貧民，誰都知道，是貧而無衣，貧而無食，上海慈善團體能有這庇寒所的設立，而且已是第八屆了，眞是我要替貧民喜歡，替貧民祝福。當然貧民離不開醫藥，而且十分急迫，貧民旣離不開醫藥，貧民庇寒所便發生了醫事問題。</p>
<p>現在就請大家指教。</p>
<p>第一點關於體格檢查方面，當貧民人所時就開始極嚴格的體格檢查，因為貧民無家可歸，無衣無食，就不免日晒夜露，則飢不飽，營養十分不良，而且因為職業的不同，所處的是最低的最惡劣的下等社會，你想在下等社會裏面生活，有什麽好事情做得出來；自然耳濡目染，類皆奸盜淫邪，言語行為，更屬卑陋散漫，有染梅毒的，有打嗎啡針的，有吃紅丸的，亦有吸雅片烟的，形形色色，不一而足，如果我們把他一進門就檢查，凡遇有患梅毒的或其他傳染病的就送醫院，打嗎啡吃紅丸吸雅片的送戒烟醫院，普通寒熱病的實行隔離，留所延醫診治，絕對的病人與非病人分隔開來，因為本來他在外面所影響的小，而現在却影響到全所人的生命，為了要保障全所貧民的生命，就不得不先施行極嚴格的體格檢查。</p>
<p>第二點，我們不僅僅第一次檢查以後，就算完結，還要在可能範圍以內每星期檢查一次，至少每月一次，為的是貧民在庇寒所裏有三四個月的庇寒時間，看他們健康的狀態進步到若何程度，誰比誰進步，製一個健康表，每星期或每月按他們的健康狀態忠實填寫，以作下屆促進貧民健康的參老。至於醫生，我想為了貧民福利，特約幾個免費醫院，請幾個醫生盡些義務，也是不難辦到的。</p>
<p>第三點，關於空氣通暢方面，以現在庇寒所裏的貧民人數計，已有一千四百人左右，室小人多窗少，大夥兒住在一起，自然裏面的炭氣多於養氣，憑你怎來呼吸，吸來吸去，養氣少炭氣多，身體的健康，必就不免發生變化，我以為可以就他們原有的組織——分班制，十三人一班，由班長率領每天早晚到曠野去散散步，呼吸新空氣，換換新環境，做幾節極簡單的柔軟體操，這是與身心有極大裨益的。</p>
<p>至於飲食方面，盡可能的做到够他們營養。</p>
<p>末了希望庇寒所常局，將貧民疾病狀况，種類，原因，以及死亡原因，作一縝密的統計，以資與下屆比較改進，使貧民得到更“康樂和善安平”的境域。</p>
<p>上而幾點，不過就作者所想到的，常然還有未曾想到的很多，在這裏，敢請社會人士予以不客氣的指教。同時熱誠地代庇寒所懇請社會人士，一錢不落虛空地，踴躍地不斷地捐輸。</p>
<h3>牙爛預防法</h3>
<p>— 任君明</p>
<p>牙爛多由細菌侵蝕所致。茲就吾人口腔內最易積留污物的地方。致細菌獲得侵蝕之機會。及其預防方法等。略述如下。</p>
<p>查牙體易被齲蝕的地方。可分三處。㊀齒冠部。（卽咬合面。）因是處凹凸不平。且有裂溝。最易拘留食糜。讓生細菌。㊁鄰接面。（卽齒縫側。）該處有罅隙可乘。肉類纖維。及殘餘食片之屬。最易附著。而醱酵齲蝕。㊂齒頸部。此處常有口涎中之細微物質。沉澱附着。擦牙時。掃除不清。積留上久。遂成牙石。亦一藏留細菌之好所在也。</p>
<p>至細菌所得侵蝕齒牙之機會。亦可分為數端。略述如下。㊀積穢拭掃不清。細菌滋生。而起齲蝕。㊁食物冷熱過度。致牙質生縮漲之急劇變化。因而破裂。為細菌侵入。㊂好食硬物。如猪骨果核之屬。咀嚼用力過甚。牙質易生咬耗及破裂。致爲細菌所乘。㊃好用金屬牙籤。牙頸常受攻伐。以致虧損。而藏細菌。㊄好作裝飾。無故鑲嵌金齒。施術者鑲配不精。或用劣料。致齒頸間粘着金冠之士敏粉逐漸脫落。遂藏留細菌。及食糜穢物。㊅江湖術士。器械未經消毒。將細菌傳染口內。且其器械粗劣。傷破牙質。細菌遂乘機而入。㊆誤用粗劣牙粉。將牙質擦薄。以致脫灰。㊇貪費廉。用劣質藥水洗牙。傷害齒牙玻質。㊈常用硬毛牙擦。</p>
<p>齒牙腐爛機會之多。已如土述。因念旣爛而求治。曷若防患於未然。預防方法。有如下述。</p>
<p>一·檢查口腔。每年請牙醫檢查二次。小心診察。缺者鑲補。殘者援脫。穢者清洗。</p>
<p>二·晨起之後。臨睡之前。及每食之後。均宜擦牙漱口。以保潔净。</p>
<p>三·牙粉牙水。宜擇質細。而不傷害齒質者為佳。牙擦用完。宜使乾燥。</p>
<p>四·勿食太硬。太冷。及太熱之物。</p>
<p>五·牙籤宜用木質而有彈性者。</p>
<p>六·糖類食後。宜卽漱口。且勿多食。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（九十九）阿迪孫氏病Addison's　Disease</p>
<p>問　什麽呌做阿迪係氏病？</p>
<p>答　阿迪孫氏病是腎上腺的疾病，於西歷一八八五年由英國醫家阿迪孫Thomas　Adison氏首先記載，所以有這種名稱。</p>
<p>問　阿迪孫氏病，原因怎樣？</p>
<p>答　眞實原因，還不能確定。但事實上是因爲腎上腺的機能减退。而使這種機能减退的原因，不外乎腎上腺結核，腫瘍，梅毒，腎上腺萎縮，腎上腺血腫等。</p>
<p>問　假使把腎上腺行外科手術而摘出之後，也能發這種病症嗎？</p>
<p>答　腎上腺摘出後所發的病狀，和阿迪孫氏病的病狀大同小異。</p>
<p>問　腎上腺摘出後所發的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　全身肌力衰弱，營養障碍，神經系障礙，（嗜眠昏睡癲癇發作，瞳孔散大等。）血壓低下體溫降低，皮下色素沉着等。</p>
<p>問　阿迪孫氏病的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　病狀發生比較徐徐進行。肌肉也是無力。神經症狀有精神倦怠，頭痛，眩量，耳鳴，不眠記憶力减退，魯鈍等。消化也起障礙，像胃液分泌缺乏，噯氣，嘔吐，吃逆，胃痛等。有時起泄瀉。</p>
<p>問　皮層也起色素沉着嗎？</p>
<p>答　這是本病的特有病狀，大槪在面部，頸部和手背等處，起褐色的色素沉着。而生理上本來多色素的部分，這時候更深些。又口唇齒齦顎和頰點膜，多起色素沉着，宛然像黑種人的樣子。</p>
<p>問　這種病發生之後，是否危險？</p>
<p>答　絕對不治。其致死原因，在乎衰弱脫力和神經症狀。</p>
<p>問　病症經過，快慢如何？</p>
<p>答　大都屬慢性經過。但若合併發熱，嘔吐、泄瀉，腹痛的時候，經過便成急性。</p>
<p>問　診斷阿迪孫氏病的時候，須要和那幾種病相辨別？</p>
<p>答　應該辨別的是妊娠時色斑，流浪人的皮色暗黑砒色素，銀中毒，皮膚黑變症，巴西多氏病等。</p>
<p>問　這種病的治療方法怎樣？</p>
<p>答　用大量的腎上腺製劑腎上腺浸膏，腎上腺素等的注射，一天三四回。或外科的腎上腺移植法等。但希望都很小。（完）</p>
<h3>海寗縣醫藥衛生之過去和現在（上）</h3>
<p>— 夏蒼霖</p>
<p>寫在前面</p>
<p>說起看潮。便沒有人不知道浙江省有海寗一縣。尤其是十九年諸橋的腦膜炎大流行。和二十三年硤石的新生活運動賽燈會。更是轟動遠近。而本年三月間之海寗縣長凟職處理烟案。濫詞一萬零四百五十元一案。遍載日報。海寗二字。更深刻的印到全國人們的腦海裏。海寗是滬杭鐵路（硤石是安）滬杭公路所經過。尤其是硤石一鎮。足以代表全縣。關於硤石的衛生調查。本刊曾刊載硤石國醫沈松年先生調查報告。現在我再把全縣醫藥衛生狀况。補充一過。也许是關於衛生事業的同志們所樂聞吧。</p>
<p>全縣公共衛生設施之過去和現在</p>
<p>海寗的公共衛生。也可説没有特别的記載。從前縣公安局（十九年）也曾設過衛生科。主其事的爲楊祖炯醫師。楊醫師是南通醫專畢業。考取甲種衛生行政人員。他是很肯研究而負責的人。關於全縣衛生行政。也着實計劃過一番。可是以經費關係。對於楊醫師的條陳。當局没法採納。祇有諸橋腦膜炎流行的時候。總算大規模的防過一回疫。化了幾萬塊錢。設了五處防疫所。這一件可説是海寗公共衛生史上最有價值的一頁。然而從反面看來。正是海寗公共衛生不完備的一種徵象。要不然便没有這種大疫流行呢。自從二十一年以後。衛生科也取消。就是連决而不行的衛生委員會。也默默無聞了。關於海寗醫藥衛生方面的集團。有</p>
<p>（一）海寗縣衛生委員會</p>
<p>（二）海寗縣臨時防疫委員會</p>
<p>（三）海寗縣縣立醫院籌備委員會</p>
<p>（四）海寗縣禁烟委員會</p>
<p>（五）寗鹽醫師公會</p>
<p>（六）海寗中醫公會</p>
<p>但是（一）—（四）現在多消滅於無形了。最近縣府雖已有衛生人員之設置。但正式的縣立診療所或縣立醫院。迄未成立。歷年來衛生事務。仍由公安局處理。比較還可記錄的。祇有一年一度的施種牛痘和防疫注射。（由縣府委托各地指定醫院義務代理）至於冬夏二季之衛生運動會。可説是照例公事。雖按期舉行。除了呼口號貼標語。開會遊行以外。對於公共衛生上有没有影響。能否刺㦸一般民衆。那就成疑問了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>救救孩子</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>早些時候，有所謂小學生“入山訪道”的這種怪誕的現象發生，這已早宣告了現代小學教育的嚴重危機，而現在却又發生了小學生的“財述”的愚舉，現代小學教育眞是值得使我們担憂的了。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：有某校讀書的小學生李明華，天天經過該校附近擺設相面攤，而專以花言巧語，騙人錢財的相面先生打聽出李明華的家道頗為富有，因此此在這天眞的小孩子身上用功夫了。說他有一種“奇術，龍將法幣每元變為百元。李明華為其所惑，卽於家中取得法幣一百二十元交於那位“神通廣大”的相面先生。相面先生念念有詞，就命李孩緊閉雙目，旋卽交彼一袋，令其迅速返家，袋中有一萬二千元矣•李孩一到家中，取開袋來一看，不過是一疊黃草紙罷了！姑知受騙，遂卽告訴他的母親，徼倖那位相面先生未曾逃走，當被帶入捕房。</p>
<p>本來，教育這東西有人視為“清高”，“神聖”，實質還不是騙人之談，教育却還是要受某一特定的社會所制限的。封建時代有適應於封建時代的教育，現代社會當然也有適應於現代的教育。自從社會進展到用“貸幣”來交換物品的階段，而貨幣又由“牛皮”等類進而至於“金錢”這一東西時，因此“金錢”這怪物，被人視為是“權力”的一種標誌，誰的金錢多，誰的“權力”就大。人，誰不歡喜做“權力者”？因此教育鼓勵人去發洋財，而為父兄者，也把他們的子弟作為一種“升官發財”的工具，給他們讀書，也無非是下一注“本錢”，將來非但有撈回的希望，並且更有“賺進”的把握。這樣交互應適，雖然一個小孩子，他們的頭腦里也充塞着發財的想頭，你不信，隨便拖牢一個小孩子去问问他：“你為什麽讀書？”總有大半會回答你：“讀了書，識得字，將來可以敬生意。”在小孩子時代作這樣想，在大孩子的時代，就會有做官的念頭了！</p>
<p>現在正是我們的民族非常危險的當兒，“入山訪道”據說是為了“救國”，倒還有“情有可原”的餘地，而現今這種“神迷”的愚舉，不可不說是教育的莫大的危機。我要向全國的小學教育界喊出：“救救孩子！”</p>
<h3>海</h3>
<p>— 灰影</p>
<p>我讀過許多關於海的文章，聽過許多海的故事，我渴望着平静時像少女般嫻靜，暴怒時壯士似的兇暴，他養活千萬的人類，亦吞減千萬的人類的海，但我第一次有機會住在近海的地方。</p>
<p>懷着恐怕和羞澀的心願似的踏上塘岸，說前面是海，但望到的只有橫在長長的沙灘後面的一個個白的浪頭，像一羣鳥在啄食，一線綠色的邊綠彷彿鑲在地的邊上，只有這一些是海，我不禁失望了。想爬下塘岸，走過沙灘，到近邊去看看海的究竟，可是陪着我的親戚不允許，說是潮漲的時候了，去會遇危險的。</p>
<p>說得那麽可怕，使我打消了走到海邊去的念頭，却堅持着要他陪着我看海怎樣從這一里多路遠走近塘岸。望着，我慚漸感到無聊，這小小的白的浪頭雖像走來，但那麽遲緩，仿佛扶着杖跨步的老者，候着，候着，天黑下來了，我再也不能堅持拉着親戚陪我，塘岸上又不能過夜，我是多願意看着海走來的姿勢，和月光上時，那一片銀色的海面呃？</p>
<p>第二天趕上塘岸，太陽照得那麽有</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>力，海，却跑得更遠了，遠到我懷疑這裏没有海，懷疑這些黄黄的土地没有人耕種的原因。我走下塘岸，細沙跳進我的鞋子，貝壳散在地上，走了幾丈遠，沙濕了，陷進我的脚，才相信這裏曾經有海的脚踏過。我以懷舊的心情，一歩歩訪着海所留下的脚跡，却只有貝殻和海藻，海他去了，彷彿一晚上他就回到不知什麽地方來的那個家去了。我望着太陽，雖然比都市中的顯得大，有力，但照在黄黄的砂岸上，總覺得討厭。</p>
<p>這一天我變成海的懷念者了。第一次想到這種心情也許是所謂失戀的心情，我還没曾有過失戀的經騐呢。</p>
<p>失了希望的夢是甜蜜的，夢安慰你的創痛。半夜，我夢到海潮漲了，海在怒嘯，我高興的跳起身子，跳起，從塘岸上滾進了洶湧的海，滾進去，可是我滾在床沿上，幾乎滾到地上，我醒了，醒了還疑心在做着夢，海嘯得多麽有力。</p>
<p>一種低沉的激怒的聲音，澎湃的撲岸聲中有着一聲聲曼長的尖哨，雜亂而宏大，這聲音就在屋頂上響，就要壓破房屋，壓扁我的頭；像許多馬從屋邊奔過，説不定踏碎這座茅屋。我半恐懼地尖起耳朶諦聽這奇偉的，雄壯的嘯聲，這大自然的呼息使我發抖了。</p>
<p>海怒着了？怒着也的脚跡被人踏糢糊了？還是海在招喚懷念他的人呢？我變得懦怯，不敢打開房門，似乎海就站在門邊，不敢去探望他，把他當作一個可怕的惡徒。懷着滿足而又惴惴的心又睡了。</p>
<p>第二早，天没亮，就起身了。踏着潮濕的小草，穿過霧層走上了塘岸，呵，在我脚下不是海麽？他一夜工夫不僅跑了過來，而且長得很高了，丈多高的堤，今天只有三四尺高，向前望去，霧阻住了我的目光，一片白，但也辯出呌嘯了一夜還在跳躍着。近岸處，浪翻着種種不同的花式，貓捕鼠似的向岸上打着，一個滾上另一背。</p>
<p>太陽起來了，朝霧漸漸散開去像一縷輕烟，鹹味的水汽洗着我的鼻子，臉，海面上先是通紅的半海的血水，接着成爲一條條金色的蛇在蠕動，跳躍，望過去没有陸地了，只見到海，海。</p>
<h3>夜</h3>
<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>在那離小車站不遠的龍記飯店中住了大約有半個月的光景，那位白髮的獨臂老人，　　我們釋　了疑　，在早晚空閒的時光，跟一切年老的人們一樣，瑣瑣地翻起他們過去的日子，歡悦的與悲愁的，且下着不約而同的感慨了。回憶，不論是苦難與幸福，對於鬢髮斑斑的人們，似乎始終是一章詩，然而把過去看得如仇人一樣，像那位没了一條手膀的老金福，一提起過去就憤恨得至於半瘋狂的狀態的老人，我們却很少見到過。——也許過去我們所生活着的是另一個世界，而老金福，則曾把他底六十歳開外的衰弱的身體，衰弱的靈魂，與無人知曉的老淚傾洒在奴隷的，虐殺的，恥辱與没有太陽的世界中的—二三年（僅僅是二三年啊）！來的地獄般的磨折使他有了一種近於瘋狂的神經，猜疑，畏懼到甚於老鼠，而對於卑汚酷慘的世界的仇恨的心情，則尤甚於火——那燃燒在老人體內的火！</p>
<p>這一天，天又夜下來了，客人們洗了手脚，在冒着黑烟的煤油燈下面亂烘烘的講説日間所見到的外面的世界，把無法排遣的疲勞與苦惱在談話中如煤油燈的烏烟一樣的噴騰出去。老金福，而今對於我們已經失掉了初時的疑懼了，照例把頭向紙窗外探一探，接着把窗子關了起來，彷彿一半是對自己説的那樣，輕輕的説過：「外面又下雪了。」</p>
<p>接着，從煤油燈的暗紅的光綫中，把蒼老的眼睛向各人底臉上疑慮地掃射了一下，但隨後又似乎放了心似的，低聲怪氣地開起口來：「你們，從小車站上來的時候，也曾留心到不曾？小站上的站名牌，也加上了折折曲曲的鬼子字了。」</p>
<p>他，特别把眼睛盯着我們，彷彿因爲我們才半個月前打那小車站上來的，要我們把那事情證實一下似的。而我們也的確曾看到過那觸目的，彷彿祇寫了半邊或一部份的中國字那樣的東西，這深深使地我們楚痛，可是，也終於無言地點了點頭，把這些不祥的事實爲老金福證實了。</p>
<p>「這地方又得遭難了，」老金福繼續説下去，這一回的聲音是不如先前那麽的平易了，彷彿有什麽東西塞在他底喉頭似的，他梗住了聲氣，抖抖地，連字眼也説不淸楚了。</p>
<p>「是的，我説，」完全是一個樣了的啊！三年前，在老家裏，也有從外面來的客人説，車站上有了鬼子字，這世界就不是我們的了！—是的，就不是了。</p>
<p>「人，那時候還笨得多，誰相信會有這種事呢？那時候是秋天快要完的時季，人趕着忙在田裏的性命，到青紗帳起後兩三個月光景，天就下起雪來了，跟現在那樣的，一片，兩片，……」</p>
<p>老金福底牙齒也打起顫來了，彷彿過去的酷慘即刻就要搬來重演似的。「在一個雪夜裏，從車站上開來了許多兵，砲車，……雷亮的刺刀，脚踏在雪地上刺刺的響，遠遠地有了槍聲，人從夢裏驚了起來—那時我還没有失掉那條臂膊，二十一歳的孩子還像小牛那般的挺壯，老婆子還會早夜咒駡那過不完的貧窮的苦日子，田裏還長着自己的高粱……」</p>
<p>「可是就這樣的，趕起來了，不明不白的，鬼子越來越緊，一家家翻箱倒籠的搶刧，把精壯的年青孩子抓住當義勇軍，拖到司令部就不明不白地整幾十個一殺，還抓了人去拷問，—抓了我去，就問孩子當了幾時的義勇軍，問他底伙伴……然而孩子不是在家裏做地的嗎？誰能説得出什麽呢？拷打了又切斷了膀子，牢裏一關二年……」</p>
<p>「不知道外面的日子是怎樣在過的，然而出來的時候，對於這生長到老的故鄉已全然不認得了，有那麽許多可愛的孩子都像豬狗一樣的死掉，娘兒們也給淫虐得死在没有太陽的角落裏，遠處有那面驀生的旗子，媽的什麽太陽，是屠主的記號……！」</p>
<p>「從這時候起，這世界就没有我們的份子。」</p>
<p>老金福駭怕得打抖，人們全都有點異樣的感覺了！那世界决不是夢，誰都那麽想，也許，這小小的市鎭不久也會……？</p>
<p>雪下得很大，外面是漆黑的夜，有誰在沙沙地踏着泥地走來，煤油燈下面的人都住了口，老人底眼睛裏已有晶營的水珠了！</p>
<p>有誰在暴急地叩響着門。</p>

<p>曹笑英「玉蜻蜓」</p>
<p>中西（一○四○）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「紅粉事跡」</p>
<p>紅粉事跡唱聲聲。是是非非照實陳。姑妄言之姑妄聽，無非遊戲作閒文。花枝姊妹歸虞舜，就是那，娥皇與女英。夏妹喜生性多奢侈，酒爲游池肉爲林。姮己欲把忠良害，巧立名目砲烙刑。周幽王誘笑寵褒姒，烽火無端亂舉行。苧蘿村中西施女，忘吳復仇報越君。烏江項羽刎垓下，殉節虞姬萬古名。出塞和番不得已，遠離祖國嘆昭君。温柔鄉裏樂無限，飛燕掌上舞身輕。陰麗華艷名傳光武，居然立后佐中興。胡笳十八歸東漢，可羡文姬恊律音。二喬不爲阿瞞鎖，空留銅雀話春深。薛靈芸針工稱妙手，魏宫博得夜來名。綠珠墜樓原有志，誓守貞操不嫁人。張氏麗華陳主幸，髮光深鑑受深恩。慧眼紅拂識俊傑，却受戀愛効私奔。則天武后心腸狠，鴆母殺君把朝臨。七月七日長生殿，太真半夜表衷情。楊柳腰，櫻桃唇，小蠻樊素配詩人。英雄巾幗梁紅玉，親執桴鼓戰金兵。艷明樓中董小宛，才容絶世擅丹青。自古美人難數盡，史籍俱已載分明，區區擱筆暫留停。</p>
<p>蔣賓初「三笑」</p>
<p>新聲「一三八○」下午七時至八時</p>
<p>開篇「三笑盤相」</p>
<p>一夜朦朧睡不寗。勸妻房自恨少章程。勉强起身無限悶。見廳前佛像無影形。依然赫赫顯門庭。進中門。上樓坪。只聽得鶯聲燕語喚新人。問唐興如醒邯鄲夢。方知中計枉聰明。恨枝山。太不情。絶交今日要翻新。書房中正在紛爭處。報道龍亭相國臨。想他位又尊。齒又高。盛怒而來難與競。眼前雖則多才士。怎及允明善解紛。談笑之間生妙計。請石田翁爲首接年尊。仇周文祝相隨後。魚貫而行出大廳。太師啟口滔滔説。老夫是特追逃僕至吳門。衆斯文聽説微微笑。半譏半勸半</p>

<p>相恃。無非衛　好　朋　與衆不同祝希哲。强詞奪理話紛紜。説得鴻山氣漸平。當塲騙出賣身契。彷彿魯連今又生。説道，欲見九娘須進內。命僮兒引領至房廳。一天大事化爲冰。</p>

<h3>火炬劇社排練「我們的故鄉」與「走私」</h3>
<p>承繼過去一年劇壇的蓬勃現象，本年度一開始，中國劇運的展開，更顯得非常之活躍了。</p>
<p>個「火炬」劇社的誕生。「火炬」的份子，都是對於戲劇工作異常努力的青年。第一次公演已選定「光明」半月刋一卷七期登載由章泯執筆的集體三幕劇作「我們的故鄉」——該集體劇作者之一的凌鶴先生導演。演員有此次演「賽金花」博得好評之夏霞小姐等。和「光明」創刋號洪深執筆的獨幕劇「走私」。「走私」一劇，在內地如南京，廣東等地曾有數十次公演，每次公演，均告滿座，足見觀衆對於國防戲劇出演之擁護，上海因客觀環境限制太嚴，未聞正式公演。聞此次該「我們的故鄉」與「走私」等劇本，已蒙社會局修正通過，將來演出，定能哄動一時云。</p>
<h3>「自由魂」雜聞一束</h3>
<p>秋瑾的服裝問題</p>
<p>四十年代劇社服裝負責人藍蘭女士，近來頗爲「自由魂」服裝問題而奔走，不單奔走，而且見人就在詢問，討論，據藍女士發表意見謂：「自由魂」在時期上説，雖緊接着「賽金花」之後，但是在服裝上説，不無少許出入，那時婦女衣長過膝，袖細而長，褲亦以瘦長爲美，而最時髦之江南派，更以滾邊紅狹爲最美觀，至於秋瑾之日本和服，以當時流行之式樣而言，大致須在和服之外，加一長裙，當時日本的知識份子，多喜架上一副眼鏡，蓋不如是似乎不能表示知識份子的尊嚴（？）云。</p>
<p>金城劇院擬改裝脚燈頂燈並製斑燈</p>
<p>自「賽金花」演出後，四十年代劇社對於該院燈光設備，頗多不滿，而最不滿意者，自然是燈光專家歐陽山尊氏，因之在演出「自由魂」之前，由歐陽山尊氏畫出圖樣，要求金城將脚燈加以改裝，並加增若干頂燈及斑燈，以便更加完美，而適於舞臺之燈光條件，聞金城方面已有採納之意。</p>
<p>秋瑾時代之婦女的頭髮</p>
<p>四十年代化裝大師辛漢文氏，在「賽金花」演出時，大有應接不暇之勢，近來辛氏每談及此，輒謂「吃不消！吃不消！」並擬聘請助手一二人，以助「自由魂」之演出，有人詢以秋瑾時代一般婦女之服裝如何？彼答：「此乃藍女士之專長，非老辛之責任也。」問者自難以此答復爲滿意，所以立即詢以頭髮之式樣，辛氏還不等問者説完話，馬上就唱起來「長劉海，彎彎分，背後再加一條尾。」</p>

<h3>Foreign Nationals in Xi'an Begin Evacuation to Luoyang</h3>
<p>External Affairs Ministry chartered plane flies from Nanjing to Shaanxi, four round trips will complete the transportation. The situation in Xi'an is now extremely chaotic, and the transition is becoming more serious again.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the repatriation of foreign nationals from Xi'an, the External Affairs Ministry and Eurasia Aviation Corporation have agreed that the company will dispatch a plane. On the 18th at 11:00 AM, the plane will fly from Nanjing to Luoyang and then to Xi'an. Accompanying the plane are Wang Guang, a specialist from the External Affairs Ministry, and Beckston, a third-class counselor from the American Embassy. The plane arrived in Luoyang around 2:00 PM, where it met with two military attachés from the British and American embassies stationed in Luoyang to handle the repatriation of foreign nationals. They flew together to Xi'an. According to embassy sources, the plane arrived in Xi'an around 4:00 PM and has a capacity of over ten people. Currently, there are approximately fifty British, American, and French nationals in Xi'an, excluding missionaries. The sixteen German nationals have already left the area at different times. The plane is scheduled to begin repatriating the first batch of foreign nationals from Xi'an to Luoyang on the morning of the 19th, making one round trip every four hours. Therefore, the plane can complete the evacuation of all foreign nationals from various countries in Xi'an in four or five round trips. Another source states that some foreign nationals have already left Shaanxi and arrived in Tongguan. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The situation in Xi'an is becoming serious again because Yang Hucheng lacks a thorough understanding and a large number of communist bandits have arrived around Xi'an. It is reported that the front line was still peaceful on the 18th, and the Central Army was only taking a defensive posture, so there was no conflict. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Yang Yiqing and five or six other officials from the Shaanxi Audit Office of the Audit Department came to Nanjing via a detour from Xi'an and reported on the office's situation during the incident. According to Yang, the situation in Xi'an is now extremely chaotic, and the future is not promising. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Tongguan news reports that the Central Government's suppression policy is still being fully implemented. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Railway news reports that the front line is quiet, and security between Huaxian and Chishui is still strict. Trains on the Longhai Railway are currently transporting grain from Yichuan and Pingxian to the west to relieve the disaster victims in western Henan. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The procedures for foreign nationals to leave Xi'an have been completed with the consent of the Central Government and Yang Hucheng. A representative from the External Affairs Ministry departed for Luoyang this morning to oversee the departure of foreign nationals. At the same time, a plane from Eurasia Aviation Corporation is en route to Xi'an. Upon arrival, all local foreign nationals who wish to leave the country can take the plane to Luoyang. Because there are about sixty foreign nationals in Xi'an, the plane will have to make several round trips between Xi'an and Luoyang to complete the transportation. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to sources in the transportation sector, Wang Guang, a section chief from the External Affairs Ministry, and Poxstan, an official from the American Embassy, took a chartered plane from Eurasia Aviation Corporation to Xi'an at 11:00 AM on the 18th to welcome foreign nationals staying in Shaanxi to leave the province. When the plane passed Luoyang, it also met with Barrid, the military attaché of the American Embassy already in Luoyang, and Chuan Ruize, the military attaché of the British Embassy, and flew west together to take care of them. After Wang and others stay in Shaanxi for a short time, they will escort the foreign nationals staying in Shaanxi in batches from that day on, using the plane to transport them out of Shaanxi. There are currently more than sixty foreign nationals in Shaanxi. The plane can carry about sixteen passengers each time. It is planned that the plane will travel back and forth between Luoyang and Xi'an four times starting at 5:00 PM on the 18th, so that all foreign nationals can be transported out of Shaanxi. It is reported that this method was agreed upon by the External Affairs Ministry and Eurasia Aviation Corporation. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] All levels of the Guangdong Municipal Party Headquarters and all party members sent a telegram to the Central Government on the 18th, requesting that Yang and other rebels be openly suppressed, stating that at this time when the suppression of bandits in Chahar and Suiyuan is striving for the final victory, how can the remnants of warlords jointly disrupt unity and hinder the national defense and salvation plan? Yang and other rebels have already broken away from the party and the country, so everyone can arrest and execute them. Why should we continue to tolerate them? Please make a decisive decision and issue an open suppression order to quell the chaos and rectify discipline. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Various suburban farmers' associations in Guangdong sent a telegram to the Central Government on the 18th, requesting that Yang and other rebels be openly suppressed.

<p>[Hankou] The Pinghan Railway Party Headquarters sent a telegram to the Central Government on the 18th, requesting that Yang Yu be openly suppressed immediately to impose sanctions on arrogant soldiers and generals, and also requesting that the whole country unanimously advocate for it. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Shanxi Provincial Party Headquarters sent a telegram to the Central Government on the 15th, stating: "The Central Executive Committee, in light of the Xi'an Incident, the whole country is heartbroken. Our Central Government has consistently adopted a generous and merciful approach, treating Zhang and Yang leniently and giving them an opportunity to reform themselves, so that they can be inspired to repay the country and jointly maintain the national foundation. Unexpectedly, the rebel Yang Hucheng is entrenched in Xi'an, showing no intention of obeying orders, and even colluding with the communists to conspire against us. If they are not eliminated promptly, the spread of the red disaster will inevitably lead to a major national disaster. We hope that you will issue an open suppression order to eliminate the rebels, rectify discipline, and quell the chaos. The people of the Northwest will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. We are eagerly awaiting your orders. The Shanxi Provincial Party Headquarters sincerely request this." (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan: Zhang Kunsheng, the director of the Shaanxi Provincial Security Office, arrived in Tongguan on the 17th for official business. According to him, Shaanxi Province has been developed under the government's leadership in recent years, and the banking industry has invested heavily, benefiting merchants and people. Shaanxi Province is also becoming more prosperous day by day. Unexpectedly, during the Xi'an Incident, Yang Hucheng recruited bandits in Sanyuan, Jingyang, and Gaoling and has recently joined forces with communist bandits to wreak havoc, causing all the construction in Shaanxi Province to be destroyed without leaving anything behind. The people all hate them to the bone. When the communist propaganda team arrived in Fuping, the local security teams all deeply understood righteousness and hated the bandits. They immediately drove them out of the area. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Flew to Nanjing Yesterday to Attend the Central Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Delivered an Important Speech</p>
<p>Also Visited Chairman Lin at the National Government</p>
<p>Warm Welcome Expressed by All Parties</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Wang of the Central Political Council, who had been receiving medical treatment in Europe, hastily returned to China due to the Xi'an Incident. Exhausted from the journey, he made a brief stopover in Shanghai. At 6:40 PM on the 18th, he flew to Nanjing from Shanghai by special plane with his wife, Madam Chen Bijun, and Central Committee member Zeng Zhongming, among others. They arrived at 8:05 AM. Party and government dignitaries braved the rain to welcome them at the Ming Palace Airport. Among those present were Chairman Lin, Sun Ke, Ding Weifen, Wu Jingheng, Zhang Qun, He Yingqin, Chen Shaokuan, Yu Feipeng, Chen Shuren, Zhang Jia'ao, Chen Lifu, Ye Chucang, Li Liejun, Zhou Qigang, He Lian, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, Ma Chaojun, and more than a hundred representatives from the central party headquarters, municipal party headquarters, various academies, ministries, and commissions. Banners with slogans such as "Welcome Chairman Wang of the Central Political Council Back to Nanjing" were hung all along the main roads. After disembarking from the plane, Wang first bowed respectfully to Chairman Lin, then shook hands and thanked the welcoming party. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, he returned to his private residence on Yihe Road with his wife and Zeng Zhongming to rest. At around 9 AM, he went to the central party headquarters to attend the memorial week report, titled "Thoughts After Returning to the Country," detailing the importance of sincere unity. After the meeting, he immediately went to the National Government to visit Chairman Lin, who expressed his deep concern. They talked for about 50 minutes. Afterwards, he visited Sun Ke, Feng Yuxiang, and chatted with Ye Chucang. After returning to his private residence, Ye, Feng, He, and others visited him one after another. Wang was wearing a dark gray suit with a black woolen overcoat. His face was fuller and more robust than before he went abroad. He looked as energetic as ever. When reporters visited him, Wang repeatedly expressed his gratitude, saying that what he wanted to say had already been expressed in his central memorial week report after arriving in Nanjing today, and he had no other opinions. According to Wang's secretary, Chen Kewen, after arriving in Nanjing, Wang was eager to meet with old friends he had not seen for a year, so he was busy with visits all day. Wang's health has recovered, but he felt slightly tired from the long journey and would take a short rest, so he politely declined all parties' banquets. Wang's thoughts after returning to the country have been reported to the Central Committee, and he has no other opinions. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Wang took the Eurasia No. 17 postal flight special plane from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 18th and arrived in Nanjing at 8:05 AM on the morning of the 18th, landing at the Ming Palace Airport.

All the dignitaries in Nanjing and representatives of various agencies went to the airport to welcome him at about 7:00 AM. Welcome slogans were posted throughout the city. Although it was drizzling and the airport was muddy, the crowd of welcomers did not diminish, which proves the enthusiasm of their emotions. Chairman Lin, President Sun, Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members Ye Chucang, Ding Weifen, Chen Lifu, Wu Jingheng, Ma Chaojun, Shi Ying, Wang Yongbin, Gu Zhenggang, Luo Jialun, Chuan Rulin, Jing Hengyi, Deng Jiayan, Chen Shuren, Pan Yunchao, Wang Maogong, Zhou Qigang, Fang Zhi, Zhang Lisheng, Liang Hancao, etc., and the ministers of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin, Yu Feipeng, Chen Shaokuan, Jiang Zuobin, Zhang Daofan, Peng Xuepei, the Capital Police Chief Wang Gu Pan, and representatives of various agencies, as well as all staff above the chief of the Central Party Department, and all members of the municipal party headquarters, and representatives of party members throughout the city, totaling more than a thousand people, held flags and banners welcoming Chairman Wang back to Nanjing. The airport was heavily guarded by the military police. At 8:05 AM, the giant Eurasia plane flew into the distance of the airport, and the entire welcoming team raised flags and applauded to show their respect. A band at the airport played music to welcome him. Mr. Wang wore a dark gray silk gown, a black horse jacket, and was full of energy and amiable. After getting off the plane in the music, he took off his hat and shook hands with Chairman Lin first as a courtesy, and expressed his gratitude. He then shook hands with Wu Jingheng, He Yingqin, Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Ding Weifen, Jing Hengyi, Chen Shuren, Gu Zhenglun, Wang Gu Pan, etc. one by one, before getting into the car. In the car, he still took off his hat and nodded to the welcoming crowd, and left the airport to return to his private residence in the new residential area. The welcomers also left by car. Wang returned to his residence for a short rest, and after half an hour, he went to the Central Party Headquarters to attend the Central Memorial Week. When he arrived at the Party Headquarters, he first met with the members of the Central Committee in the conference hall. After the Central Memorial Week, he went to the National Government to attend the Memorial Week and then returned to his residence. Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Wu Jingheng, He Yingqin, etc. all came to visit. (Central News Agency telegram from the 18th)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] The Central Committee held its 59th Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 18th. Those who attended included Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Sun Ke, Chen Lifu, Ding Weifen, He Yingqin, Jiang Zuobin, Ma Chaojun, Zhu Peide, Gan Naiguang, Wu Jingheng, Shi Ying, Zhang Daofan, Peng Xuepei, Gu Zhenglun, Luo Jialun, Jing Hengyi, Chen Shuren, Xiao Zhongzhen, Shao Hua, Zhang Qiang, Hong Lanyou, Chen Shaokuan, Fu Rulin, Xiao Jishan, Chen Panling, Gu Zhengding, Fu Bingchang, Wang Yongbin, Chen Bijun, Zeng Zhongming, Wang Maogong, Hong Ludong, Deng Jiayan, Gu Zhenggang, Pan Yunchao, Lu Yougang, Di Ying, Mei Gongren, Tian Kunshan, Liang Hancao, Liu Jiwen, Wang Shufang, Mai Siwude, Zhou Qigang, Fang Zhi, Yu Feipeng, Wang Kunlun, Xiao Zheng, and others, as well as all staff members, totaling about 700 people. At 9:00 AM sharp, the bell rang and the meeting began. When Wang entered the hall, everyone applauded to welcome him. After Chairman Sun Ke led the ceremony, Wang delivered a report. The meeting adjourned at 9:30 AM. The original text of Wang's report is explored below: "Since I was falsely assassinated at the gate of the Central Party Department on November 1st, two years ago, my old illness was triggered by the new injury, and I lingered for several months. It is only today that I am able to meet with you comrades again at the Central Party Department. I am truly filled with mixed emotions. Especially when I think about how, in these past few months, you comrades, based on the domestic and foreign policies set by the Fifth Plenary Session and the First and Second Plenary Sessions of the Central Committee, have strived hard under the leadership of Comrade Chiang Kai-shek and made continuous progress amidst internal and external troubles and heavy pressure, and I, due to my injury and illness, was unable to participate, I feel even more ashamed and deeply admire the difficult efforts of you comrades. The Xi'an Incident on December 12th of last year was extremely painful. Fortunately, the central government handled it properly, Comrade Chiang's sincerity was touching, the efforts of all comrades were consistent, and the people were of one mind, upholding justice, so that this incident was able to turn danger into safety. We can only work harder to complete the mission of the National Revolution. When I returned from overseas, I passed through various ports and saw that the overseas Chinese mostly had inquiries about various important issues in the country. Because I had not discussed them in detail with the comrades of the Central Committee, I was unwilling to express any opinions alone, so I only told the overseas Chinese some of my thoughts. Today, when I first arrived here and met with you comrades, what I can say are still some thoughts. For several years, our comrades have been working actively under the policies set by the Central Committee, trying to find a way out of internal and external troubles. The common slogan is "Sincere unity to overcome national difficulties." Because we deeply feel that at this juncture, if we want to seek survival from death and preserve existence from destruction, we must rely entirely on our own strength. The so-called self-reliance is by no means an isolated meaning. We are willing to join hands with any country or nation in the world in the sense of common survival and development. We are of course willing to work together under the principle of mutual benefit with those who have no aggressive ambitions. Even if there are those with aggressive ambitions, and they have taken action, we are willing to use 12 points of sincerity and patience to seek their awakening and embark on the path of common survival and development. In addition to offering our hearts, we are also prepared to shed our blood, because in the case of aggression, friendship is out of the question. We need a lot of bloodshed, continuous bloodshed, until the aggressor puts down his butcher knife and says, "You have shed enough blood." Only then will the aggression end and friendship begin. Our so-called self-reliance is doing our best, not isolation. We have been coping with national difficulties with this kind of determination for several years now. In these years, although there have been various changes and temptations, our determination has never wavered. For example, someone once said, "Joint anti-communism." We believe that the current anti-communism problem in China is limited to the country. We believe that our own strength will be more than enough to prevent communism. If it were not for the internal troubles and external threats in recent years, we would have completely prevented communism long ago. Even with internal troubles and external threats, the facts tell us that the anti-communism progress has not been stopped because of this, although it has suffered a lot of obstruction and牽掣. From Jiangxi to Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan, it has been gradually cleared. This is the greatest evidence that we can prevent communism with our own strength. Also, someone said, "People's Front, jointly resist insults." This slogan is even more popular. I think we need to pay attention to a few points here. First, the so-called sincere unity to overcome national difficulties is of course not only for the party, but also for the whole country. However, the so-called People's Front has a certain meaning and scope. For example, France also has the slogan of the People's Front, and its content is that various parties unite under the same goal and stand on the same front. The most important condition is that none of the parties are armed. French Prime Minister Léon Blum disarmed the Croix-de-Feu group, and at the same time did not allow the Communist Party and other groups to be armed. France has only one government, and there is no so-called Soviet government outside the French democratic government. France has only one army, and there is no so-called Red Army outside the French National Defense Army. This is how the People's Front in France can happen and exist. It is hoped that those who use the slogan of the People's Front will pay attention to this. Second, someone said, "The most important thing today is to resist foreign aggression first and internal stability second." However, we don't know that internal stability and resisting foreign aggression are one thing, not two things. It should not be divided by importance, but by order of priority. Because survival depends on winning or losing against foreign aggression, we must have the ability to resist foreign aggression before we can be sure of resisting foreign aggression. There is no way that we can talk about resisting foreign aggression if we are not healthy ourselves. We still remember that during the Battle of Shanghai, the government transferred the Jiangxi army to help, and the communists attacked Ganzhou. During the Battle of Gubeikou, the government transferred the Yangtze River army to help, and the communists broke Fuzhou and attacked Nanchang. After these two painful experiences, armed comrades and those who understand the content know that internal stability is essential for resisting foreign aggression, so there have been years of bloody battles. This bloody battle is not because internal stability is considered more important than resisting foreign aggression, but because it is well known that internal stability is the first step in resisting foreign aggression. This point must be paid close attention to. Third, someone said, "The communists have already expressed their intention to jointly resist foreign aggression, which shows that the situation is different from the past." However, we need to know whether this expression is reliable or not, and whether there is a guarantee. The facts of the past tell us that when the first National Congress was held, the communists solemnly stated that their joining the Kuomintang was for the National Revolution, not for propagating communism. However, later, they did not do what they said. Some people in the Kuomintang still believed them, and some were already suspicious. Therefore, the Kuomintang had continuous disputes for several years. In hindsight, it was not that the Kuomintang was wrongly injured, but that the Communist Party broke its promise. But would the Communist Party admit that it broke its promise? They believe that revolution is for the purpose, regardless of the means. The so-called keeping promises and being trustworthy, in their view, is feudal morality and not worth considering. Their view is like this. What reason do we have to believe that their expression is true and lasting? This painful past experience cannot but be worth arousing our attention. The above are used to explain the facts of the past. Today, we certainly need the people of the whole country, regardless of boundaries, to work together. At the same time, we must also see the environment clearly, stand firm, and not let our entire plan and certain steps for saving the country and preserving existence be greatly affected by negligence, or even put the country's future in the tragic situation of Spain. I mean that our first step today must be to lead the whole country towards the Three People's Principles and move forward vigorously, so that we can gather the strength of the whole country to lay the foundation of the country. The second step must be to strengthen the country's ability to save itself and stand on its own, so that it can be worthy of being friends with any country in the world. This is a goal that the Central Committee has given us to strive for for several years, and we must adhere to it and move forward without stopping. The above are my recent thoughts, and I hope you comrades will give me your advice. (Central News Agency telegram from the 18th)</p>

<p>Events Occurred Repeatedly Last Year</p>
<p>The Debt Market Was Not Shaken</p>

<h3>The Number of Casualties in the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Accident Exceeded 100</h3>
<p>The Fire Was Caused by Careless Actions</p>
<p>And Expanded Due to Insufficient Equipment in the Car</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] This morning, another 20 charred corpses were found in the ruins of the Guangzhou-Kowloon express train accident last Saturday night. The number of casualties has now reached 105. According to a preliminary investigation, the fire was caused by a passenger accidentally setting fire to candles and rosin toys, which immediately spread to various luggage items. When the passengers saw the fire, they panicked and fled to neighboring cars, causing many people to be crushed and trampled to death. When the train was running, the wind was strong, so the fire took advantage of the wind and shot out from the middle carriage, affecting neighboring cars, until it burned the third car, and the driver noticed it and stopped the train. At that time, it was near Youlong, about 50 miles from Guangzhou. The car was not equipped with a alarm system, so it was impossible to warn the driver for a while, because it was to prevent ignorant passengers from arbitrarily pulling the alarm rope, so this equipment was not made. The authorities have now ordered a thorough investigation of the cause of the accident. (Reuters telegram from the 18th)</p>

<h3>New Developments in the Japanese Parliament</h3>
<p>— Independence</p>
<p>The 70th Japanese Parliament. In two more days. It will reconvene at the new Diet building in Nagata-cho, Tokyo. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the implementation of constitutional government in Japan, and the new Diet building commemorating constitutional government took seventeen years to complete. From the perspective of the two "established political parties" in Japan, this parliament should have special significance. They are eager to take advantage of the opportunity of this parliament's reconvening to confront the one controlled by military forces.</p>
<p>The Hirota Cabinet's policy direction will face severe questioning, using this as a means of reviving parliamentary politics. At the same time, the government authorities are also working on strategies to cope with the situation. Therefore, this parliament is worth noting. The Hirota Cabinet plans to submit as many as one hundred and several dozen bills to this parliament. Among them, the most important and the one that will become the focus of debate is the tax increase issue. On November 27 last year, the Hirota Cabinet, after only a little over an hour of discussion, unanimously approved the massive budget for the Showa 12th fiscal year. The total revenue and expenditure amounted to 3.04 billion yuan, of which the military budget amounted to 1.426 billion yuan, accounting for 47% of the expenditure. The source of this large budget is largely based on tax revenue, estimated at more than 230 million yuan. The result of the tax increase will naturally lead to rising prices, increase the burden on wage earners, and reduce purchasing power. On the other hand, it will also affect export trade and industry, increasing the depth of economic panic. Therefore, after this news spread, the financial community strongly opposed it, and the industrial community was also gloomy. Recently, leading figures in the Osaka business and industry circles, such as Kataoka Yasuyuki, Kigi Yunosuke, and Furukawa Tetsushiro, organized groups to actually support the "established political parties," so that when they attend parliament, they can do their utmost to oppose the government's tax increase policy. The government, in addition to having Finance Minister Baba respond to the parties' questions, denying that rising prices are related to tax increases, is also prepared to use strong, even dissolving parliament, measures to achieve its tax increase plan.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Hirota Cabinet has many weaknesses in diplomacy, giving the "established political parties" an opportunity to attack. The most important is that diplomacy towards the Soviet Union, China, and Britain can only be accommodated, seemingly undermining the dignity of the leader of East Asia. Although the Japan-Soviet fisheries and Japan-Australia trade negotiations reached temporary compromises at the end of last year, the pending Japan-Egypt, Japan-India, and Japan-Netherlands trade negotiations remain stalled. The sorrow of the Hirota diplomacy's failure is ultimately undeniable. Therefore, the established political parties are bound to seize on this weakness of the Hirota Cabinet to spur it on.</p>
<p>The confrontational situation between the "established political parties" and the government is as described above. Whether the Hirota Cabinet can overcome the difficulties and achieve victory in this reopened parliament probably depends on the strength of the military's support.</p>
<h3>Philippine President Declares Military Training to Maintain Independence</h3>
<p>No Intention to Help the US Fight Japan, Quezon to Visit China and the US Soon</p>
<p>Manila - Philippine Commonwealth President Quezon delivered a speech to 15,000 members of the ROTC at the Philippine University parade ground today, saying that pacifists at home and abroad are indignant at the misunderstanding of the mission of US military advisor to the Philippines, MacArthur, to train the Philippine army. The mission of the Philippine army is to ensure the security and dignity of the Philippines. The world should understand that the Filipino people are determined to rely on their own strength to build an independent country, maintain the integrity of its territory, and the rights of the nation. No group in the United States and the Philippine Islands can stop it. The Philippine Constitution is the most modern constitution in the world, which prohibits the use of war as a tool for national policy and adopts international law as national law, and therefore is unwilling to use force for aggression. The national force is only used to defend the country and maintain order within the country. Speaking of the strength of the Philippine army, including the police, there are about 10,000 people. It is ridiculous to say that this small number is enough to attack a militarist country with 1.5 million soldiers. Or it is said that the US military advisor to the Philippines, MacArthur, is determined to train a large army to help in times of urgency when the US and Japan go to war. This is also not worth the laugh of those who know the situation. Japan is a friendly country of the Philippines and has no signs of interfering in the affairs of the Philippine Islands. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Philippine Commissioner's Office in the United States announced today that Philippine President Quezon will come to the United States via China and Japan, first to Hong Kong, and then take a Canadian company's mail ship, arriving in Vancouver around February 14. President Quezon's visit is to attend the US-Philippine Economic Conference opening in March. However, the itinerary has not yet been completely determined, and it is possible to travel through Europe to Washington. (17th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Conditions for Resolving the US Maritime Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>Workers Agree to Consider</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The Chairman of the Shipping Association, Mr. Bland, announced today that the shipping companies have submitted two proposals to the International Longshoremen's Association for them to choose from. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ $1.00 per hour during work hours, $1.50 per hour during overtime hours, six hours of work per day, but dockworkers may work two hours of overtime when necessary without additional pay.</p>
<p>㊁ $0.95 per hour, $1.40 per hour for overtime, six hours of work per day, from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the International Longshoremen's Association has now begun to consider it.</p>
<p>Mr. Bland also stated that the Shipping Association and the International Longshoremen's Association have reached a consensus on other points of contention. We have reached a tentative agreement with the Three Labor Union Conference, and agreements with the other four labor unions will soon be established. The progress is very satisfactory, proving that if both parties are sincere, nothing is impossible to resolve. Representatives of the shipping companies are continuing negotiations with the Cooks and Stewards Union. (17th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>New York Silver Company's Annual Report Comments on China's New Monetary System</h3>
<p>Excellent Results in Foreign Exchange Management, No Belief in Restoring Silver Standard</p>
<p>[New York] The leader of the New York silver market, Henry Harman &amp; Co., issued its annual commentary on silver today, stating that China's currency management plan has achieved excellent results in foreign exchange. However, it is currently difficult to determine whether China's foreign exchange is completely divorced from silver prices. As for the silver that China and Hong Kong shipped to the United States last year, it was the same as in 1934, exceeding the production of silver that year. In total, the silver exported by China and Hong Kong, including the silver shipped out by Japan exceeding production, reached 30.2 million ounces. Although there were cases of smuggling out of China, it was not of great importance. Last year, the world's silver production increased by 16% compared to the previous year, but the international monetary use of silver did not tend to increase. The US silver purchase plan has not been successful, so the company still advocates abandoning it. London estimates that if the United States stops buying silver, the price of silver may fall to 16 pence per ounce. Last year's fluctuations in silver prices were minimal, the only time seen since 1900. The increase in production was the most in South American countries, averaging 34%. The United States also reached 32%, an increase of 15.5 million ounces compared to the previous year. The strongest supporter of the silver market was the United States, which not only fully absorbed the raw silver from Canada and South America, but also purchased the Chinese government's silver reserves, which greatly improved public confidence. Secondly, India made a significant contribution to the London silver market, never selling throughout the year, and its absorption increased tenfold, averaging 10 million ounces purchased annually in the past four years, and reaching 100 million ounces last year. The total world production was 252 million ounces, of which the United States accounted for 64 million ounces, Mexico 82.1 million ounces, Canada 19.2 million ounces, South America 31.4 million ounces, and other countries a total of 56.3 million ounces. China's silver smuggling in the first eight months of last year was at most only 30 million ounces, far from the situation in the previous two years. The Chinese government sold 19.2 million ounces in the first eleven months. If the price of silver rises in the future, the Chinese currency will naturally not be affected, but the government may sell the profitable silver again. Even if the price of silver falls, the Chinese people now firmly believe that the currency has nothing to do with silver, and there will be no panic. The opinion in Shanghai does not believe that silver will have the opportunity to be the standard of China's monetary system again, unless the United States wants to make other arrangements with China. Since the competition for currency devaluation in various countries has not completely ended, China will not use the silver standard again unless it reaches a firm understanding with the United States. Of course, there is still a lot of silver hidden in the Chinese interior, and the amount is difficult to estimate, but if the price of silver can be stabilized, the Chinese government will never change its current policy. As for the funds from China's sale of silver reserves, they are now stored in the US Treasury, partly in cash and partly in foreign exchange credit. The United States is still in the most important position regarding the world's silver situation. Last year, the government purchased 381.2 million ounces. The government's current silver reserves, including silver coins, total 1.9 billion ounces. (17th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Current State of Naval Competition Among Nations</h3>
<p>(London Dispatch) "Jane's Fighting Ships," edited by Mr. McMurtrie, has just been published, detailing the tireless efforts of the world's naval powers to compete in military expansion. It is said that Britain currently holds the top spot, with a total of ninety-nine new ships under construction. Other countries related to maritime security are also implementing massive programs to increase and replace warships. The failure to limit battleships in "quantity" is closely related to this. In the next three years or more, the number of new battleships launched will be more than at any time in the past twenty years. Since the principle of treaty-based quantitative restrictions was effectively abandoned, the naval construction boom has erupted with fury. Since the end of the European War, the tonnage of new ships built has never been as great as it is today. In recent years, countries have rarely built battleships, but today, all major powers are free to build them. By 1940, Britain will add two completely new 35,000-ton battleships. These two ships, named King George V and Prince of Wales, will have their keels laid at the beginning of this year. The United States will build two battleships of the same displacement on the same day. Japan also plans to do so. France has already started building one ship and will continue to build another one soon. Germany currently has one 35,000-ton battleship and is expected to add another one of the same type this year. Italy started building two battleships in 1934, but the project is progressing slowly and is unlikely to be completed before 1940. Therefore, the total number of new battleships launched by 1940 will undoubtedly be more than in any year since 1916. This astonishing speed of shipbuilding seems to be creating new characteristics in naval tactics. It is now believed that none of these new battleships have a speed of less than 30 knots, while Britain's most advanced battleship, the Nelson, has a speed of only 23 knots.</p>
<p>The naval conference held in London this morning failed to achieve its initial goal of quantitatively limiting naval armaments. Among the five participating powers, Britain, the United States, and France all agreed to certain restrictions, such as limiting battleships to 35,000 tons and installing 16-inch caliber guns. At that time, it was attempted to limit the caliber of the guns to 14 inches, but it would only be effective if all countries that joined the Washington Naval Treaty declared their willingness to comply by April 1, 1937. This hope is extremely slim. The British government has now negotiated separate treaties with Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union, containing the main clauses of the London Naval Treaty. However, the conference had already exhausted all means to eliminate the alarming factors of building new ships.</p>
<p>Now, a careful analysis of the shipbuilding programs that naval powers have implemented and proposed can provide a general understanding of the world's naval planning. The shipbuilding program is the largest in Britain, listing a total of 99 warships of various types. The following table provides a brief overview of the number and type of warships currently under construction or planned by major naval powers:</p>
<p>Britain: 2 battleships, 3 aircraft carriers, 3 destroyer leaders, 32 destroyers (including 16 large ones), 13 small watercraft, 13 small warships and minesweepers, 17 net-laying ships, fishing boats, and torpedo boats, totaling 99 ships.</p>
<p>France: 3 battleships (3 with a displacement of 35,000 tons and 15-inch caliber guns, 1 with a displacement of 26,000 tons and 13-inch caliber guns), 3 cruisers, 2 destroyer leaders, 11 small warships, gunboats, etc., totaling 43 ships.</p>
<p>Germany: 1 battleship (displacement of 35,000 tons, equipped with 14-inch caliber guns), 2 aircraft carriers, 3 heavy cruisers, 12 destroyers, 9 large and small submarines, 12 minesweepers, totaling 39 ships.</p>
<p>Italy: 2 battleships (displacement of 35,000 tons, equipped with 15-inch caliber guns), 2 ocean-going cruisers, 4 destroyers, 35 torpedo boats, 23 submarines, totaling 66 ships.</p>
<p>United States: 2 battleships (displacement of 35,000 tons, equipped with 16-inch caliber guns), 1 aircraft carrier, 11 cruisers, 52 destroyers, 15 submarines, totaling 83 ships.</p>
<p>Japan: Plans to build 4 battleships (approximately 35,000-ton class), 2 aircraft carriers, 2 cruisers, 14 destroyers, 4 submarines, 12 torpedo boats, totaling 38 ships.</p>
<p>"Jane's Fighting Ships" criticizes the shipbuilding programs of various foreign countries as follows: "Although the French naval construction work is still hindered by labor disputes and other difficulties, the total number of warships to be built successively in the new construction program in 1937 is no less than about 40. The number of old ships being decommissioned has increased compared to before, the most notable being the pre-war battleships 'Diderot' and 'Voltaire'. Germany continues to follow its orderly process of replacing old ones with new ones. The United States Navy is currently working hard on the construction of destroyers to replace the positions of decommissioned ships. The number of US submarines can already be the highest in the world. As for the Soviet Navy, although its naval commander has stated that since 1633, the Soviet Navy's submarines have increased by 300%, and coastal defense ships have increased by 175%, in reality, there has been no large-scale construction of new ships by the Soviet Union. Even the number of submarines that the Soviet Union is most vigorously building is likely to be an exaggeration of the announced number."</p>
<p>The most noteworthy news from Japan is that the Japanese government has decided to convert a 26,000-ton warship, which was converted into a artillery training ship according to the 1930 treaty, back into a battleship. Although there is no official confirmation of this statement, there seems to be no reason not to believe it. Japan has also renovated a warship in a new style. Judging from the images, it is very sophisticated and can be called a very characteristic feature of Japanese naval construction. The design of the new British battleships will have special facilities for defense against air raids. In addition to being equipped with 14-inch caliber guns, they are also equipped with aircraft. Each of the three new British aircraft carriers has a displacement of 22,000 tons and is said to be able to carry 70 aircraft. (Reuters)</p>
<h3>US Auto Workers Strike Resurfaces</h3>
<p>Workers Refuse to Leave the Factory, Negotiations May Be Frustrated</p>
<p>Flint - The workers occupying the factory buildings of General Motors, who were on strike, originally planned to leave the factory this afternoon, but have temporarily changed their policy. The workers' leaders are holding meetings to study whether the company has agreed to collectively negotiate with employees who do not belong to the union. If this is true, the workers remaining in the factory will definitely not leave. The company has completely denied this, saying that although the company has received telegrams from such employee groups, it only replied that the company is willing to discuss everything with any group without any preconceived notions. At the same time, the chairman of the strike committee, Martin, also telegraphed the Senate Civil Liberties Investigating Committee, saying that the group's leader, Bao Aisheng, is colluding with the company to sabotage the strike. Michigan Governor Dafei issued a statement today, warning military and police authorities to protect all parties and not to be partial. (17th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Flint - The striking workers at the General Motors factory today firmly refused to withdraw as scheduled due to the breach of contract by the capitalists. There are three reasons: ㊀ The capitalists secretly notified the workers at the Cadillac factory to go to work on Monday, which violates the agreement that the capitalists would not open the factory before formal negotiations. ㊁ Proposing separate negotiations with non-union workers. ㊂ Deploying guards in various factories to prohibit worker pickets.

<h3>British Trade Minister to Arrive in Washington</h3>
<p>London Elites Pay Close Attention</p>
<p>[London] British financial expert and Trade Minister Ren Sickman and Sir Milo Ya, Director of the International Clearing Bank, will arrive in Washington this week. Financial elites in London are paying close attention to this. There is much speculation about the true purpose of the two gentlemen's trip. However, the rumor that this is a prelude to convening an economic conference of Britain, the United States, and France has been denied by the authorities. It is the intention of certain people in the financial world that this trip is closely related to negotiations on stabilizing the exchange rate fund. It is heard that US Treasury Secretary Morganthau especially approves of this move. During the two experts' stay in the United States, they seem to be discussing the exchange rate issue. Many also believe that they will take the opportunity to consider reducing tariff barriers to encourage free trade. This trip is especially welcomed by the financial community, because they intend to expand the sterling area to include the three countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula, which in practice is beneficial to the expansion of trade.

<h3>France to Implement 40-Hour Work Week</h3>
<p>[Paris] The Council of State held a meeting at 10:30 this morning, dedicated to Public Works Minister Bedus presenting the issue of implementing a 40-hour work week for railway employees nationwide. This working time will be implemented from January 25. Bedus added that, according to expert opinion, after the implementation of the 40-hour work week, the national railways can hire 60,000 more employees. Bedus also said that the current railway business situation has improved. During the Christmas season last year, railway revenue increased by 20.7% compared to previous years, and the average railway revenue also increased by about 15% compared to before. (18th Havas)</p>

<h3>Mussolini and Göring's Talks Come to an End</h3>
<p>German Ambassador to Italy Returns Home for Instructions, Mussolini Talks About Italian-German Relations</p>
<p>[Rome] Mussolini declared when he received a German reporter today, "German-Italian friendship is the prelude to European cooperation." When the reporter asked whether this cooperation can form a European federation in the future, Mussolini gave a negative answer, saying that this is a utopian dream and is impossible from the perspective of history, geography, and politics. As for the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Agreement and its impact on German-Italian understanding, Mussolini said that the agreement will not only not weaken German-Italian understanding but will also strengthen it. Mussolini also said, "The agreement alleviates the increasingly tense situation and gives us several years of time to continue peaceful development to build lasting peace. This is the inevitable result of Italy's efforts to maintain European peace, and the Anglo-Italian agreement is an important step in realizing this plan." (17th National Telegram)</p>

<p>[London] The German National Socialist Party's newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter, published an interview with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in which he stated that the Mediterranean Gentleman's Agreement concluded between Britain and Italy will strengthen the system with Germany and Italy as the axis of Europe. Political figures here feel uneasy about the interview, because the British side has not made such an interpretation of the Mediterranean Gentleman's Agreement. At the same time, it is rumored that Mussolini intends to initiate a union of Italy, Germany, Britain, and France to conclude a treaty. This is also viewed with suspicion by political figures in Britain. It is heard that British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, has not reported on the talk between Mussolini and German Aviation Minister Göring about concluding a four-nation treaty. Drummond is scheduled to return home for a visit within days to attend his relatives' wedding. (18th Havas)</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Principally Agree to Ban Volunteer Soldiers to Aid Spain</h3>
<p>But cannot sit idly by as Spain turns Red. Soviet Russia and France have already submitted their replies to England.</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to well-informed sources here, Germany will express its principal agreement in its reply to England regarding the proposal to ban volunteer soldiers from going to Spain to participate in the war. Today, a spokesman for the German Foreign Office stated that although Germany is happy to see the end of the Spanish Civil War, it cannot turn a blind eye to the attempts to organize a Soviet colony in that country. Germany's opinion on this matter is exactly the same as that of the Italian government. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Regarding the question of banning volunteer soldiers from serving in Spain, after the British government put forward new proposals on the 10th of this month, the Soviet government has now sent a reply. In addition to instructing its ambassador to England, Maisky, to deliver it to the British Foreign Office, a copy was also sent to Lord Chilston, the British ambassador to Russia. The reply was typed on two sheets of paper and signed by Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Litvinov. It first stated that the Russian ambassador to England, Maisky, had sent a letter to the London Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee on December 4 of last year, advocating that the non-intervention policy currently adopted by various countries should be promoted so that it can also be applied to the volunteer soldier problem, and advocating that since various countries intend to set up commissioners on the sea and land borders of Spain to monitor the import of munitions into that country, the recruitment of volunteer soldiers to Spain should also be entrusted to these commissioners for special supervision. Maisky then submitted a memorandum on December 29, the contents of which confirmed the points previously accepted by the Soviet government and expressed a sincere desire for the adjustment committee to determine a date to establish an effective monitoring system, the sooner the better. To this end, the reply stated, "In my view, the above two official documents can respond to the note submitted by your country and correspond to the proposal to extend the monitoring method to volunteer soldiers and regular troops." The Soviet government now hopes that the member states of the adjustment committee will immediately instruct their representatives stationed in Spain to immediately monitor the landing of volunteer soldiers or regular troops in Spain, without having to wait for the rebel authorities in Spain to agree in principle before proceeding. "However, if the ban on volunteer soldiers is implemented unilaterally by any member state of the adjustment committee, and other countries do not accept the restrictions, it will not only fail to achieve the expected goal, but will instead benefit the Spanish rebels. The Soviet government now mentions this point as a matter of duty." "Moreover, the Spanish rebels have not yet expressed their approval in principle of the monitoring method. As for the government of a certain country that is aiding the rebels, it has neither clearly expressed its position on the establishment of a monitoring method, nor is it certain about the issue of stopping the dispatch of its regular troops, which are called volunteer soldiers, to Spain. If this is the case, is it not premature to take a ban? Its conclusion stated, "The Soviet government is not currently sending volunteer soldiers to Spain, but it is also inconvenient to take unilateral measures and impose restrictions on itself." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The French government sent a reply to British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps on the 13th of this month, the full text of which was recently published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The content confirmed the points previously agreed upon orally by the French government and stated that the French government is now asking its parliament to grant it the necessary powers so that it can implement a ban on volunteer soldiers serving in Spain when other governments take similar restrictive measures. However, the above ban will be of little practical effect if it is not accompanied by effective monitoring measures. Furthermore, even if effective monitoring measures are formulated, if it proves impossible to implement them, France will then be free to resume its actions, either by declaring the abolition of its obligations or by organizing international cooperation measures.

<h3>Greece Borrows Heavily from Germany</h3>
<p>To Expand Military Preparations</p>
<p>Athens - Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Savvatzianos recently told the press that Germany will lend Greece a huge sum of 4,000,000,000 drachmas (the name of the Greek currency) for the purpose of expanding military preparations. He also hinted that the government will issue an order in the shortest possible time to issue this loan, with an interest rate of three percent, and repay it in six years with the surplus from trade with Germany. Greece has always had a trade surplus with Germany, with tobacco exports to Germany alone reaching 1,600,000,000 drachmas annually. The Finance Minister also said that after the government obtains this loan, it will immediately implement the previously decided military expansion plan. This plan will be completed in eight years, at a total cost of 5,500,000,000 drachmas. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>German Military Service Extends to Overseas Germans</h3>
<p>[Berlin] German leader Hitler has decided to recruit Germans living abroad for military and labor service. This is the first time since Germany implemented conscription. The authorities today issued a notice ordering German consulates abroad to recruit soldiers born in 1917. Germans born in that year may be forced to serve. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Representatives Arrive in Germany for a Return Visit</h3>
<p>First Time Since the European War</p>
<p>[Berlin] Air Minister General Göring previously invited British Air Force officers to send a delegation to Germany for a tour to promote friendship. This delegation has now arrived here. As Göring himself has gone to Italy and has not yet returned, General Milch, the Undersecretary of the Air Ministry, will be responsible for hosting them. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] A delegation of British Air Force officers flew to the Staaken military airfield today. This visit was in response to an invitation from Air Minister Göring and is also the first time that British Air Force representatives have visited the German Air Force. The delegation consisted of four officers, led by Air Vice-Marshal Carter. They flew to Germany on a passenger plane from Imperial Airways. Upon arrival, Colonel Dowding, the British Air Attaché, Major von Viehlinghof, the Adjutant of the German Air Ministry, and many senior German Air Force officers went to the airfield to welcome them.

<h3>British Leftists Form United Front</h3>
<p>And Announce Political Program</p>
<p>[London] The Socialist League, the Independent Labour Party, and the Communist Party have recently decided to conclude an agreement in order to take concerted action. They will jointly issue a communiqué stating that the labor movement has now formulated a plan for mass struggle and will establish a united front within the scope of the Labour Party and trade unions to engage in the struggle against fascism, anti-war, anti-national government, and to suppress reactionaries. The main points of this plan are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Resist the government's rearmament plan.</p>
<p>㊁ Advocate that Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries where workers enjoy political freedoms should jointly conclude a treaty.</p>
<p>㊂ Nationalize the arms industry.</p>
<p>㊃ Assist India in resisting British imperialism.</p>
<p>Finally, the communiqué stated that the United Front has now received the support of some leftists and will soon conduct propaganda throughout the country. The first meeting is scheduled to be held in Manchester on the 24th of this month. The Communist Party separately passed a resolution stating that the above agreement is not directed against the Labour Party. On the contrary, its purpose is to make the Labour Party the unified organization of the British labor movement. The Independent Labour Party also passed a resolution, putting forward several reservations regarding cooperation with the United Front, the most important of which is that the working class has always distrusted the League of Nations' collective security system and the military agreements established between capitalist governments.

<h3>Polish Opposition Party Determines Political Program</h3>
<p>Cooperation with the Government is Possible</p>
<p>Warsaw - The People's Party, which belongs to the opposition and originally represented the Polish peasantry, recently convened a temporary congress and passed a resolution. Its listed political program is as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Oppose fascism and communism.</p>
<p>㊁ Demand the establishment of a democratic electoral system.</p>
<p>㊂ Grant amnesty to all political prisoners currently imprisoned in the country and those exiled abroad.</p>
<p>㊃ Oppose political concessions to the Free City of Danzig.</p>
<p>㊄ Oppose the German government's oppression of Polish minorities within its borders and the construction of defensive works on the Polish border.</p>
<p>㊅ Oppose the continued tense relations between Poland and Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>This political program is more moderate in tone, so it is possible that the People's Party may join the government. Currently, opinions within the government are divided into two factions: one is the right wing, which advocates dictatorship, and the other advocates cooperation with the more moderate opposition. These two factions are evenly matched. With the support of yesterday's congress of the People's Party, it is increasingly possible for the party to cooperate with the government. Therefore, political figures are paying close attention. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>British-Irish Negotiations</h3>
<p>Commercial Treaty Can Be Concluded First. Merger of North and South Ireland is Difficult.</p>
<p>[London] According to the Sunday Express, after a sincere conversation between Irish Free State President Éamon de Valera and Dominions Secretary Malcolm MacDonald, a British-Irish commercial treaty will be concluded, enabling Britain to reduce import duties on Irish cattle and horses, while Ireland will also reduce import duties on British manufactured goods. According to a dispatch from the newspaper's Dublin correspondent, all major issues have been decided. The only obstacle is the "Irish Federation" issue. It is also said that de Valera insists on the merger of Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State, but the method of merger has not been explained in detail. This request seems to be the main difficulty in realizing friendly relations between Britain and Ireland. The newspaper finally stated that it is too early to speculate on close cooperation plans, but negotiations based on goodwill rather than malice will ultimately be an important contribution to British-Irish relations.

<h3>Tianjin Cotton Merchants Oppose Increased Cotton Inspection Fees</h3>
<p>Stalemate Continues for Over a Month with No Solution. Losses to Officials and Merchants Reach 14 Million Yuan.</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The dispute over the increase in cotton export inspection fees here began last month and is still unresolved after one month. Officials and merchants are in distress, and the impact on export tariffs is significant. Since the 12th, cotton merchants have resolutely opposed this move and have severed contact with foreign merchants handling exports. As a result, no cotton has been shipped out of Tianjin port since the 13th. The severity of the situation has reached its peak. The cause of this incident was the dismissal of Chang Hongjun, the director of the Ministry of Industry's Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau, in early December of last year. Ji-Cha Political Council directly appointed advisor Liu Ji to take over. At the same time, it ordered that, starting from December, the inspection fee would be increased by one yuan for each bale of export cotton under 200 catties, and two yuan per bale for bales over 200 catties. The reason given was to restrict the export of substandard cotton to avoid affecting international trade. However, the underlying reason was that the Ji-Cha region had huge expenditures and insufficient military and political funds, so it took this opportunity to slightly supplement its finances. After the measures were promulgated, the cotton merchants of Tianjin were in an uproar. In the past, the cotton inspection fee was only one yuan per bale, plus the tooth tax and commission fee of 35 cents, totaling 1.35 yuan, which was already a considerable amount. If another yuan is added, the burden on the cotton merchants would be too heavy. In addition, the common suffering of the cotton merchants is that cotton is usually purchased from various counties at the beginning of summer and autumn and then contracts are signed with foreign exporters. All expenses are included in the total fixed price. For example, if it is stipulated that 100,000 bales will be exported, the Commercial Inspection Bureau will charge an additional two yuan for each bale when the goods are delivered, totaling an additional 100,000 yuan in losses for the cotton merchants. Although the North China cotton crop was abundant last year, the selection for export was very strict. Foreign merchants rejected and did not purchase any cotton that was slightly damp or had slightly shorter fibers. After the Shaanxi Incident, millions of bales of cotton stored in Xi'an were destroyed. This is especially difficult for ordinary cotton merchants to bear, so they decided to fight to the death against the Commercial Inspection Bureau's increase in inspection fees. Starting on the 11th of last month, the Cotton Merchants Association publicly decided to refuse inspection. Cotton transported from outside the county was stored in warehouses. On the one hand, representatives were sent to the Commercial Inspection Bureau, the Tianjin Municipal Government, and the Ji-Cha Political Council to petition and voice their business difficulties, demanding cancellation. On the other hand, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Industry, requesting that the Ministry instruct them to stop this. Some cotton merchants submitted a petition to Minister Wu Dingchang when he came north to visit Song while residing in Tianjin. However, as this matter was not handled by the Ministry of Industry, Wu also felt that he could not intervene. The cotton merchants have been running around appealing for weeks with no results. The Ji-Cha Political Council summoned representatives of the Cotton Industry Association last week and promised to mediate, adopting a compromise approach, ordering the Commercial Inspection Bureau to slightly reduce the inspection fee, and the cotton merchants to bear a little more of the burden. The cotton merchants refused, leading both sides to go to extremes. On the 12th, the cotton merchants convened a trade association and jointly decided to sever contact with foreign merchants in order to expand the issue and attract the attention of foreign merchants. This idea was successful. On the 13th, Tianjin cotton export foreign merchants held a meeting and drafted a letter to the Commercial Inspection Bureau, asking the authorities to pay attention, quickly resolve the issue, and not go to extremes or delay, causing foreign merchants to suffer. The Commercial Inspection Bureau forwarded the letter to the Ji-Cha Council for approval. Japan, which purchases a large number of cotton from North China, accounting for 75% of its production, purchased even more last winter in preparation for military needs. At the beginning of this disturbance, they were also worried about being affected and expressed their opposition. Later, as a result of negotiations, the cotton purchased was transported through Tianjin and exported through the puppet territory of eastern Hebei without bearing the aforementioned fees. Currently, only British and American export companies are assisting the cotton merchants in the dispute. There are currently more than 240,000 bales of cotton stored in Tianjin. Each bale of American cotton is worth 57-58 yuan, and each bale of Xihe cotton is worth 48-49 yuan. Since it has not been exported for a month, the combined losses to officials and merchants are more than 14 million yuan, which can be said to be huge.</p>
<h3>Capital Social Construction in Progress</h3>
<p>And the Situation of Relief Efforts</p>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: The Municipal Government held the weekly memorial service for the Premier at 8:00 AM yesterday. All staff members attended, and Bureau Chief Chen Jianru of the Social Affairs Bureau presided over the ceremony. Subsequently, Zheng Shenhui, the section chief of the Second Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, reported on the recent progress of social construction and relief efforts, stating briefly: "In handling social affairs, we should give equal consideration to both the active aspects of construction and the passive aspects of relief, without favoring one over the other. Therefore, the social administration of our bureau over the past year has been advancing based on this principle. Now, I will briefly describe the most important four social undertakings that have been recently carried out, as follows:"</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the Construction Aspect: ㊀ Preparing for the Establishment of a Rice Market. According to the original four major rice markets in China, one was in Changsha, Hunan; one in Nanchang, Jiangxi; one in Wuhu, Anhui; and one in Wuxi, Jiangsu. As for whether it is necessary to establish a rice market in Nanjing and whether it meets the conditions for establishing a rice market, according to my observation, Nanjing is not only a crucial hub on the Yangtze River in terms of transportation, but also the center of the north-south railway. The areas around Xiaguan Sanwen River and Jiangxin Island can dock a large number of ships. In terms of personnel, the population has increased from over 300,000 to over one million. In terms of national defense, the capital's position is crucial. Therefore, Nanjing has the necessity to establish a rice market in all aspects and meets the conditions for establishing a rice market. However, why has it been delayed until now that the Rice Market Management Office has been reluctantly established? The history behind this is very complex. In simple terms, there was a proposal to establish a rice market in Nanjing during the late Qing Dynasty. Later, due to the deep hometown sentiments of Li Hongzhang, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, the planned Nanjing rice market was changed to be established in Wuhu, Anhui. Before the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Capital Construction Committee also proposed the establishment of a rice market in Nanjing and established a Capital Rice Market Preparatory Committee to prepare everything. During the time of Mayor Shi Qian, the committee was changed to the Capital Rice Market Preparatory Office. However, due to the failure to abolish the Dashengguan rice dumpling donation at that time, the ban on rice exports from Jiangsu Province, and various other personnel issues, it failed to succeed early on. After Mayor Ma took office, considering that the Nanjing rice market was related to the people's food in the capital and the prosperity of the city, he ordered our bureau to make the preparation for the establishment of the rice market one of the central tasks and strive to promote it, and appointed me as the director of the preparatory office. Over the past year, the organization design committee has conducted group research, and with the full cooperation of all parties and joint efforts, it has now been largely completed. As for the location issue, many citizens have submitted requests for surveys and confirmations. Some advocated for Touguan or Dashengguan, while others advocated for outside Zhonghua Gate. After repeated on-site surveys by us, we felt that the areas around Touguan and Dashengguan were too far from the city center, and although the outside of Zhonghua Gate already had a prototype of a rice market, the river channel was too narrow, making ship transportation inconvenient. Our ideal goal is to find a location that is suitable in terms of terrain and transportation to help promote the development of the rice market. We have no preconceived notions. Recently, the Rice Market Design Committee, after careful research, decided to first establish a rice market management office to manage the existing rice market. We feel that the establishment of the Nanjing rice market is indeed something that cannot be delayed any longer. First, Nanjing produces very little rice, and the city's monthly demand for rice reaches 150,000 to 160,000 dan, mostly relying on external sources. Second, the city has been preparing for the establishment of a rice market for more than a year. Although the conditions are not yet perfect, Mayor Ma and Bureau Chief Chen both believe that it is better to establish it first, and efforts can be made to complete it in a short period of time. Third, although there were bumper harvests in various places last year, Jiangsu and other provinces have banned rice exports. Not long ago, He County, Anhui, detained more than 100 rice boats coming to Beijing. After several negotiations, they were released. Due to these various reasons, the city officially established the Rice Market Management Office on December 25 last year to manage and adjust, so that sources are smooth and supply and demand are balanced. However, due to financial constraints, personnel and administration are striving for economy. All personnel are concurrently serving bureau members, and only two are full-time, both of whom were transferred from the former Rice Market Preparatory Office. In addition, four students were selected from the graduates of the commerce department of the Municipal Junior Vocational School as trainees. It is hoped that all parties will uphold the spirit of impartiality and selfless dedication, a sincere attitude of cooperation, and truly connect and work together to lay the foundation for the rice market as soon as possible. Moreover, the Rice Market Management Office is by no means a tax collection agency, but a service-oriented organization that serves the citizens completely. In the future, there may be charging fees, but all decisions made will be used for construction project expenses. This should be specially and solemnly stated. I recently went to Wuhu, Wuxi, and other places to investigate the future management office of the rice market, and plan to adopt the advantages of each place as much as possible. ㊁ Promoting Cooperative Enterprises: Before the city received the rural areas, there were only more than a dozen cooperatives in the city. Since receiving the rural areas, the city's cooperatives have increased to 78, of which Xinxihe District accounts for the largest number and Xiaoling District accounts for the smallest number. After Mayor Ma took office, considering that cooperative enterprises are related to the development of the national economy, he made promoting cooperative enterprises one of the central tasks. As a result, the number of cooperatives in the city has greatly increased. Recently, I met with the person in charge of the Rural Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and explained in detail the improvement of rural areas in the city. Currently, the Rural Finance Bureau intends to set up a cooperative treasury in the city, with a planned capital of 100,000 yuan. The city intends to draw a distribution map of rural cooperative enterprises, marking the established cooperatives and the cooperatives that should be established but have not yet been established, as a basis for promotion. In the future, it is estimated that at least more than 100 cooperatives can be added. As for talent, it is planned to hold winter rural training courses, selecting the current directors and supervisors of each cooperative and outstanding members of the rural areas to attend lectures. This training course was held once last year and achieved good results. It is now planned to hold the second training course at the end of next month, focusing on discussing cooperative issues. Experts from all parties are invited to serve as lecturers to instill cooperative common sense. The training period is about two weeks. The cooperative personnel training class held by the Rural Finance Bureau will graduate at this time, and it is planned to ask them to send graduates to serve in various rural areas in the city to promote cooperative enterprises in the city.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Relief Efforts: ㊀ Expanding the Municipal Relief Center: The center is the only relief organization in the city, and the number of people it accommodates has now increased to about 5,000. Last year, Mayor Ma and Bureau Chief Chen felt that the city's refugees and beggars were forming groups, which hindered the appearance of the capital. Therefore, last year, 33 refugee and beggar shelters were built on Badou Mountain to accommodate a large number of refugees and beggars in the city, strictly manage them, and combine education and training, in order to achieve the goals of industrialization and discipline. As for the craftsmanship aspect of the relief center, although several types have been set up before, the content is very lacking and insufficient to meet the needs. Therefore, Mayor Ma recently ordered the Finance Bureau to allocate 15,000 yuan as a craftsmanship fund for the expansion of the relief center, and plans to concentrate efforts on expanding the most important types of craftsmanship, such as woodworking, brick and tile, straw shoes, earthwork, etc. Special attention is also paid to the issue of the future of orphans. It is now planned to select 50 to 80 orphans and send them to military factories, construction industries, barber shops, clothing stores, etc. to learn. After they complete their studies in the future, they can either stay in their original places to serve or return to the center to serve. In this way, it will be a win-win situation, and these orphans will be able to make a living on their own in the future. ㊁ Holding Winter Relief: Every winter, the city has a precedent of establishing a winter relief association. This year's winter relief association's methods are different from previous years. The investigation of the poor is entirely handled by the military police, and then the winter relief association sends personnel to review and decide before distributing relief. It is currently being actively handled, but the funding is very tight. In addition to the 8,000 yuan left over from last year's winter relief association, the Ministry of Finance allocated 10,000 yuan, the Municipal Government allocated 500 yuan, and the Relief Committee allocated 1,000 yuan, totaling only about 20,000 yuan. There is too little porridge for too many monks, and it is felt that the distribution is insufficient. It is now being carefully handled to ensure that the generally poor and helpless people can receive practical benefits.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Electric Power User Association Established</h3>
<p>The local electric power company used to charge 25 cents per character. Recently, after the Shanghai Chinese Electric Power Company provided electricity, the price was reduced by one cent. However, with the increase in electricity and the acceleration of the electricity meter, each user felt that the monthly electricity bill had increased sharply compared to before, which was not worth the loss. Previously, the county Gao Association, at the request of merchants, requested a reduction in electricity fees. The company replied that the fee collection had been approved by the Construction Committee and did not send anyone to attend and explain. The merchants believed that the company had no sincerity and held a general meeting of users at the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday (17th). More than 200 people from groups, schools, shops, and users attended. Cheng Weiru was temporarily elected as chairman. After discussion, Zhang Mengxing, Chen Weiru, Lu Shulian, Sun Shiheng, and 11 others were elected as committee members to organize the committee. They requested that the electricity price be charged at 18 cents per character, based on the electricity price provided by the Chinese Electric Power Company to Pudong, and sent personnel to negotiate with the company. If there is no solution, they will petition the Construction Committee. During the petition period, the association will notify users to temporarily suspend payment and wait for a solution. As for the speed of the electricity meter, it seems inaccurate. The committee should seek to improve it properly and install street lights in the area outside Dongmen Mingxing Bridge and in densely populated areas.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Builds the Lao Wutuan Bridge</h3>
<p>Director Cao of the Wuxian Construction Bureau, considering that the Lao Wutuan Camp outside the Chuangmen Gate to Huqiu Road is separated by a river, and there has never been a bridge, only a ferry boat. Pedestrians crossing at the entrance of the West Garden are extremely dangerous every time it rains. Now there are more residents in the area, and there is also the Provincial Magnetic Engineering School. In order to facilitate transportation, it was approved by the Construction Department to build a bridge there, named Lao Wutuan Bridge, 6 meters wide and 22 meters long. Construction has already started and is scheduled to be completed in 55 clear days. After the bridge is completed, cars can directly reach Huqiu, the railway station, Lao Wutuan, Zhujia Bridge, Sanliuliu Bay, and other places.</p>
<p>Two Lawyers Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Lawyers Shi Liang and Shen Junru were detained in the detention center of the High Court for investigation of the case. The Wuxian Lawyers Association was ordered by the High Court to inform them that the above two lawyers were temporarily suspended from their duties. The High Court also notified the Shanghai Local Court and lawyers Shi and Shen.</p>
<h3>Changshu Xingfu Murder Case Has Clues</h3>
<p>After the male corpse found in the Di family wheat field outside Hanbeimen was inspected by the county government, important clues were obtained and there was great development. At that time, a pair of reed flower shoes was found beside the corpse, which was not taken seriously at first. Surprisingly, it was the only clue. The other shoe was found in the Xu Yier Tea House. Therefore, all were arrested and determined that the case was indeed a murder for money. In addition to the four main criminals Xu Er, Lu Yuyu, Tan Yongfu, and Lu Erer who have been captured, two criminals, He Mou and a fat man, are also being pursued. The truth of the case will soon be revealed. The deceased Qian Shengsheng has been collected and buried by his father Qian Guanfu.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Urges the Collection of Old Arrears of Land Tax</h3>
<p>Dong Chengqi, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department, cleaned up the old arrears of land tax in Wuxi, Changshu, and Taicang counties and inspected financial administration and organized the treasury accounting system. Therefore, he came and went in a hurry and was quite busy. Yesterday (18th) at 4:00 PM, member Dong went to the Xixian Government again to discuss the method of clearing old taxes with Section Chief Huang Fu of the Second Section. It was decided to first pursue the old taxes from the Republic of China in 1921, 1922, and 1923, and then pursue them in order. If major households resist and fail to pay, they will be detained immediately.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Private Prostitutes Arrested</p>
<p>The women's reformatory in this county is affiliated to the South Gate vagrant training center and has now been established. Police Chief Zhang Da, because the city is full of private prostitutes, which is harmful to society, ordered each branch bureau to earnestly arrest them. Yesterday (18th), the first branch bureau arrested 25 private prostitutes in Jiuchengli and Shoukangli and other places and transferred them to the main bureau for custody. They will be sent to the reformatory for training today, for a period of six months, and then released. Currently, there is no trace of private prostitutes in various hotels on the road, but each branch bureau is still conducting a strict search.</p>
<h3>Kunshan Holds Business Registration</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau of this county, in order to facilitate the management of restaurants, has specially held business registration and has formulated 20 rules, which have been submitted to the provincial department for approval and implementation. It has strict regulations on the sanitary equipment of restaurants and various business matters, and restricts the employment of female waitresses.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Da Zhonghua Company Goes Bankrupt</h3>
<p>The Da Zhonghua National Goods Company in Yangzhou's Duozi Street was originally opened by Qiu Zhenming in Gongde Lane, Zeng Mou in Fuxi Street, Zhong Mou in Zhangganggou, and three or four other shareholders, and Liu Yiqing was in charge of everything. All goods were shipped from various manufacturers in Shanghai to participate in the business. The company's rent and miscellaneous expenses were distributed to the company, which was equivalent to a disguised national goods market. Unexpectedly, the company leased houses to decorate the storefront and owed all street accounts, which amounted to a large number. Yesterday (16th), as it was unable to cope, the person in charge avoided appearing and went bankrupt invisibly. Each manufacturer packed up and shipped out the goods last night (16th) at 7:00 PM. At that time, the company owed Huamu's Dai Zhonghe, Baofan's Kong Xinji, Yikang Huamei's two electrical material stores, and the blacksmith shop that made fences, totaling 750 yuan. Because the person in charge had repeatedly promised to pay but had not paid, they rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and tried to interfere. Because there were public security guards guarding the door, and the manufacturers who were packing the goods had broken a lot of glass furniture in the chaos, the situation was extremely messy. Zhu Bian entered the door and went to Gongde Lane to ask shareholder Qiu Zhenming for payment. However, it was heard that in addition to this huge debt, there were still some debts to the printing shop, rent, and street relief households, amounting to nearly 1,000 yuan, which was not easy to clear up. Today (17th), those who passed by the company's door saw that the fences were tightly closed, and there were several films in the glass windows, indicating the names and addresses of the shareholders and the person in charge, so that creditors could find the address to go to negotiate the aftermath.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang Smokers' Surrender Period Extended</h3>
<p>Wang Depu, the commissioner of the Huaiyin district, because the four counties of Huai, Huai, Lian, and Si in this district have been carrying out drug clearing, and the time limit has been extended to the 10th of this month, and there are many county, district, and township chiefs stationed in Huai, it is suspected that there are not enough people handling drug clearing, and the drug clearing work has not been thoroughly done. He previously reported to the Ministry of Civil Affairs requesting an extension to the 20th of this month. On the 14th, he received an order from the Ministry approving it. Today (15th), he telegraphed the above-mentioned counties, that the time limit for smokers to surrender will be extended for another ten days from January 10. Overdue procedures for general review will be carried out. If anyone is reported or caught as a smoker, they will be punished with appropriate criminal penalties.</p>
<h3>Funing County Staff Privately Forge Grain Skewers</h3>
<p>Tao Chunfu, a bookkeeper in the county government's tenant guard section, reported to the county government through the Dongkan sub-counter that fake skewers and fake stamps were found to collect grain and money. The government sent police to Tao Chunfu's house in Dongjia Lane to search and copied out fake skewer vouchers and a lot of other evidence. He immediately took Tao Chunfu and Miao Yuzhi, who was distributing the application, to the county government. After interrogation, his words were vague, and he was indeed suspected of privately collecting grain and money. It was ordered to be put under guard first, and then reviewed when County Chief Wang Shuxian returned to the government from supervision due to public affairs.</p>
<h3>Dinghai Daishan Riot Case Verdict</h3>
<p>The Daishan fishermen and salt miners' riot case once caused a sensation. After the captured criminals were transferred to the Hangzhou Local Court for trial, it was not concluded for a long time. On the 11th, the Criminal Court summoned them again and announced the verdict. Seng Xinliang was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of political rights for life. Lin Afeng and Lin Shaoye were each sentenced to twelve years of fixed-term imprisonment and deprived of political rights for ten years. Wu Rongguang was sentenced to fourteen years of fixed-term imprisonment and deprived of political rights for ten years for two crimes combined. Fan Agen and Lin Shoufeng were each sentenced to five years of fixed-term imprisonment and deprived of political rights for five years. The remaining seventeen people were innocent and released on bail.</p>

<h3>Second Inter-Port Football Trial Match This Sunday</h3>
<p>Ideal Team vs. China Team at Shenyuan - Saturday Youyou Survey Decides Zilin Cup</p>
<p>This week, the West League football Saturday Youyou and Survey will hold the Zilin Cup final. In Group A, Jinan will play against Portugal, West Capture will play against Shell, and Lax will play against the West Chamber of Commerce. On Sunday, the inter-port Ideal Team will play against the China Team for the second trial match, which will still be held at Shenyuan. The rest will only write about the B-Inner Group and the Morning League. As for the lineup of the Ideal Team this week, the Shanghai Football Association announced it at the same time yesterday. In addition to Bao Saizhong, Zhaxu, Chen Zhenhe, Sun Jinshun, Tuile, and Jiemu Huate, the rest have been changed to a new one. Yezi and Xiaboers of Laoyier, Jack Huate and Bao Xiutuo of the French Chamber of Commerce, and Viktai of Portugal have been added to the inter-port team. However, the lineup arranged this week, such as Sun Jinshun being appointed as the center forward, is still debatable. Sun has been playing on the left and right wings for a long time and has not officially served in the center. Once he suddenly changes position, I am afraid he will not be used to it. Jack Huate serving as the left midfielder is also a waste of talent. Zhaxu is old, but he still has to be prepared. Bao Saizhong has played before and performed extremely poorly, but he is still given the original position, while Zhang Rongcai has no chance to try. It is really unpredictable. The trial match will start at 3:00 PM, but the following players must gather at Shenyuan before half past one. In addition to the team uniform provided by the association, they must also bring their own shorts, socks, and shoes. At that time, the lineup may still need to be changed, so the reserve members must also be present. The lineup and order of the Ideal Team this week are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Xiqing Basketball Independent Group Ends - Xintong Wins Championship</h3>
<p>Yesterday, San Yi defeated Mailingjia 31-24 - Mailingjia Took the Lead by Seven Points in the First Half</p>
<p>Xiqing Basketball held three games yesterday. Nanjing University still forfeited in the University Group. The success or failure of the final between the Xin Tong and Mailing Jia in the Independent Group was crucial to the championship and was very attractive. The stadium was full again. After the match, Mailing was extremely sharp. Bolie Caijin Dong, Pan Luosi, and others shot four times in succession, and they were invincible with eight points. Carson scored a goal, and Xin Tong started recording. After Mailing paused, he added a penalty point. After that, Xin Tong added five points and chased to 9 to 7. However, Mailing Jin Dong, Lobok, Lie Cai, and others made three throws, and they took the lead with 14 to 7 in the first half. The audience was sweating for Xin Tong. Unexpectedly, after the re-match, Xin Tong's arrogance suddenly increased, and Mailing fell sharply. Pisai Er, Shi Guia, and Carson fired without fail. In a flash, he exceeded Mailing by two points with 19 to 14. After Mailing asked for a stop twice, Jin Dong shot a goal. Shi Guia made a throw and Carson made two penalties, and the score was even more ahead. Although Mailing adjusted his new force to appear, it was not helpful in the end. After adding that point, Xin Tong easily added to 27 to 18. As time was about to end, Mailing saw some activity, once chasing to 27 to 20 and 29 to 22. In the last few seconds, Lan Yin and Locke each made contributions. Mailing actually turned defeat into victory with 31 to 24 in an extremely superior situation. Xin Tong also dominated the independent group of Xiqing with twelve wins in twelve games and won the championship. The last game was between Xin Team and Qingguang. In order to prevent the Chinese team from falling into the bottom, the Xin team specially sent substitutes. The old men personally appeared on the stage, and the Chinese talk turned out to be a hundred jokes. At the end of the first half, 23 to 20, Qingguang took the lead. As a result, 56 to 36, the Xin team was defeated. Now the independent and university groups of Xiqing have all ended. Xin Tong and Fudan have won the independent and university group championships.</p>
<p>Junior Group Final Order</p>
<p>The A Division of the Junior Group of Xiqing Basketball has been completed. However, the three teams of Yuezhong, Tongwen, and Su Keer are tied, so a championship round-robin tournament has been held separately. In addition to the first game where Tongwen has won Su Keer, there are still two games between Yuezhong vs. Tongwen and Yuezhong vs. Su Keer. After the championship is produced, the championship final can be held with the B Division champion, adopting a three-game two-win system. If the second game has been resolved, the third game does not have to be held. There are still two A Division supplementary games and two B Division championship games, and three championship games, a total of seven games. The order has been arranged as follows:</p>
<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association Results Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Basketball Association had three games in Group B and one in Group A and A. ㊀ The strength of Tianxing and Jingwu was equal, and they played very well all the way. In the last four minutes, Tianxing rose to a peak and won with 36 to 21. ㊁ The game between Zaofeng and Guanghua was quite close in the first half, but after entering, Guanghua became a river going downhill. ㊂ The war between Jianmei and Shangzhong was also close. ㊃ The A and A group game between Wulong and Quanhei was initially evenly matched. After ten minutes, Wulong's ball momentum was smooth. At the end of the first half, Wulong led by 20 to 8 points. In the sound of re-war, the actions of both sides gradually became rough, especially Quanhei, which almost led to unhappiness, which is regrettable. As a result, Wulong won with 36 to 21. The results are as left.</p>
<h3>Huang Bochang to Fight Haben Xin Tonight</h3>
<p>8:30 PM at the Vienna Ballroom</p>
<p>Huang Bochang, a famous Chinese wrestler, will meet Haben Xin at the Vienna Ballroom on Jing'an Temple Road at 8:30 tonight. Haben weighs 220 pounds, which is 5 pounds heavier than Huang. In addition to the last person, Ha also defeated the four of Huang's previous losers, Petersen, Yarkuido, Miha, Pihavan, and Abbadal. Therefore, his strength is not weaker than Huang. In addition to the main match between Huang and Ha, tonight's program also includes a wrestling match between Philippine Yarkuido (215 pounds) and Indian Pihavan (230 pounds), and four other boxing matches. Tickets are divided into two types: 4 yuan, 3 yuan (reserved seats) and 2 yuan (ordinary).</p>
<h3>West Capture's Amazing Move - First Win Against China Youth</h3>
<p>600 to 421</p>
<p>In the Shanghai Amateur Billiards League, the Chinese Youth Association ranked first on the score table of each team. Unexpectedly, in the first game of the sixth week against the Buxi Sports Association yesterday, they encountered a strong opponent. The fifth Yan Xiangguan and the first Ding Mingyi, who competed, were defeated one after another, suffering heavy losses. The total number of points lost was 179, which was an unprecedented huge loss for the Chinese Youth Association. The position of the leader is inevitably shaken. Tonight, the third Zhu Qiliang will face Brett, and the fourth Bao Qiyun will face Tuolinxi. The two generals Zhu Bao should seize the opportunity to regain the lost points and maintain the original leading position to fulfill their duties. The reason for the failure is that the personnel are half and half. The two generals who participated in the war were in poor spirits. As soon as they encountered obstacles, they showed signs of slackness and unease. In addition, the bullets were moving too slowly, which was not accustomed to. When Yan and Chang Erben were in a battle, the situation was extremely tense, and the score difference was still close. At the last moment, Yan failed with 243 to 300 behind. The highest record was Holben 27, 27, 20, 23. The best was 35, 25, 21. In the second game, Ding Mingyi appeared and lost to Que Xiaoxun with 178 to 300. Que Xiaoxun is also one of the famous generals in Shanghai and is not easy to deal with. If Ding Mingyi is in a good mood, the outcome is still uncertain, let alone being distracted and unfamiliar with the platform. It is only natural that he suffered a major defeat. The highest record Que Xiaoxun 20, 48, 24, 34, 52, Ding Mingyi 24, 23.</p>
<h3>Qingwu Handball Team Held General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Qingwu Handball Team held a general meeting at the Indian Curry Restaurant on Sima Road yesterday afternoon to discuss team affairs. During the meeting, team leader Gao Zishou reported on the team's history and future plans, and passed Liu Yulin, Yu Dingan, Hua Qifeng, Xu Baomin, Wang Heliang, and Zhang E, and six others. It is also known that the Qingxing team, a strong team led by handball veterans Sun Daosheng and Zhu Kuan, has verbally invited the team to hold a confrontation. However, for the sake of prudence, the team will not act without a formal war invitation.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Northeast University Has Not Yet Accepted Students, Internal Disputes Arise</h3>
<p>Due to Conflicting Views, They Ultimately Resorted to Armed Brawls</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Peiping, 18th: Northeast University experienced a bloody brawl due to the issue of food. Light injuries were sustained by both sides, and the students are gradually recovering. Apart from Jing Si Ji, there have been no changes in the conditions of the seriously injured students. The three Northeast schools are now calm. The students who were summoned for questioning yesterday have been bailed out by the school authorities. The school authorities are holding a Disciplinary Committee meeting today to punish the students involved in the incident. Li Futong, Xue Zhenjia, Yang Xiaofei, Wu Shixuan, Zhang Shangzhou, and five others, totaling nine, have been expelled and ordered to leave the school immediately. Wang Daren, Yang Ti, and Liu Nanlu have each received two major demerits. Zhai Guofu and four others have each received one major demerit. Chen Jianxing and two others have each received one demerit.</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: Regarding the Northeast University takeover issue, the newly appointed President Zang Qifang has not yet received the Ministry of Education's order and is still waiting. The current Secretary-General of Northeast University, Zhou Jingwen, hosted a banquet on the evening of the 17th for all members of the school's Faculty Union to discuss coping strategies and examination matters. Regarding the student body, due to the takeover issue, extremely opposing factions have formed internally that are irreconcilable. Those who oppose the takeover are led by the Student Union, while those who welcome the takeover are centered around the "Anti-Communist National Salvation School Protection Group." Previously, they attacked each other through wall posters and slogans, but this was quelled after the school authorities intervened. Because their emotions had nowhere to be vented, they moved from written conflict to armed brawls. Recently, both factions have been actively preparing, resulting in an outbreak at the South Campus on the morning of the 16th. Five people were seriously injured, and more than ten were slightly injured. The seriously injured students were all sent to the Central Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the school authorities and police intervened to suppress the situation and took two students involved in the incident to the Fourth District for questioning. As of 6 PM, security throughout the school remained extremely tight. A brief account of the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Both Sides Issue Accounts of the Brawl</p>
<p>The Student Union issued the following account of the incident: At 8:30 AM this morning, during breakfast, some students were dissatisfied with the poor food quality and banged their bowls. This responsibility should have been borne by those in charge of the food service and had nothing to do with the so-called "New Student Union." However, the head of this illegal group, Xue Zhenjia, returned to the dormitory, armed with a wooden stick and a dagger, and charged back to the dining hall, raising his knife to stab Li Yi, who was mediating. Li's eye socket was injured, and blood flowed. Taking advantage of the opportunity, the perpetrator returned to the dormitory and gathered accomplices, preparing to escalate the situation. At that time, the crowd was furious and wanted to question the assailant. Li Yi questioned him while injured, and the thugs broke down the door and attacked the students with thick, long sticks. A sacred institution of learning became a scene of violence. Zhang Shangzhou, who had plotted the attack and stayed overnight at the South Campus, was the first to knock down Jing Si Ji with a heavy stick. The others, including Xue Zhenjia, Yang Ji, and Wang Dake, used coal, bricks, water bowls, flower pots, stove lids, and other objects to throw at the students. The seriously injured students were taken to the Central Hospital by the school's car. According to the examination results, the doctors are still uncertain whether they are in life-threatening condition. According to the "School Protection Group," the account is as follows: ⑴ The incident this morning occurred when the Secretary-General of the school, Zhou Jingwen, came to the South Campus and personally directed the Student Union to injure "School Protection Group" students. ⑵ The school authorities called the police to help suppress "School Protection Group" members. ⑶ Student Union members carried weapons when entering the dining hall. ⑷ After the incident, a group of forty or fifty men carrying sticks were brought in by car to join the fight. ⑸ The Student Union guarded the school gate, preventing "School Protection Group" members from entering or leaving. Those with minor injuries jumped over the wall to leave the school, while the seriously injured were sent to the hospital.</p>

<p>Around 11 AM, the Secretary-General of the school, Zhou Jingwen, the Dean of the College, Yang Weizhen, and the Director of the Preparatory Class, Guan Fude, arrived after hearing the news. Zhou immediately convened a meeting of all students at the South Campus in the auditorium to give instructions, saying, "I am deeply saddened by this unfortunate incident that occurred at our school today. Why must we, as Northeast youths who have fled to the interior, divide ourselves? I hope that the students will focus on the exam tomorrow, and the school will be responsible for protecting the safety of all students." Subsequently, Yang and Guan gave separate instructions. The meeting concluded around 12 PM.</p>
<p>Five Seriously Injured People Were All Sent to the Hospital</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Large Accounts Selling Public Bonds</p>
<p>Type A Especially, Down 80 Cents Alone</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw increasingly active trading. The market situation was bleak due to the times, firm but falling again. The market sentiment was initially firm, and buying interest was strong, causing the market to rise sharply in the morning. Both Type E and Type B bonds exceeded the new high since the opening auction. In the afternoon, due to the emergence of large long positions and the enthusiastic selling of hedging positions, the supply of lots gradually became crowded, and market prices tended to decline again. Type A bonds, in particular, attracted much attention from large accounts due to their surprisingly high prices, and many sold off their positions, so the drop was also sharp. The trend was still stable when the market opened yesterday morning. Number 50 and retail investors were quite willing to bid. Type E and Type B bonds rose by 5 to 30 cents. Type C bonds, on the other hand, were decorated by Number 72 and sold off by Number 47, and returned to a decrease of 5 to 10 cents. In the next round, the selling pressure on the floor turned strong, and Numbers 10, 47, and 11 all had huge sales. Numbers 43 and 50 still bought in, and market prices uniformly fell by 5 to 40 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, the decline became even more severe.

The total trading volume was 8,385,000 yuan. The comparison of the rise and fall of highs and lows is listed on the left (unit yuan, trading unit 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Settlement Deadline Approaching, Yarn Market Situation Unraveling</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the situation is unusually fragmented. There are few transactions in the market, so the auction time is very short. Generally, as the final settlement deadline approaches, both long and short positions have shortened their lines. However, most operators have a small mindset. Although securities and gold merchants are still in a long position due to sluggish actual needs, they are ultimately restricted by the Osaka Sanpin yarn reaction and falling winds.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn February Only Half</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning, and each month fell unanimously, and the falling wind was especially strong. The reason is that Sanpin yarn is moving step by step downstream, and most of the industry is bearish. Therefore, the market situation is very weak. Only the February issue is held very strongly by the long side. After the third session, the sales of spot yarn are still good. The floating positions were offset and rose. As a result, the February and April issues rose by 2.4 cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. The March issue fell by 3.6 cents. Although the Sanpin yarn continued to fall by 3.4 yuan after the market opened in the afternoon, the market sentiment has not changed. There were very few transactions in the market, and the market price did not rise or fall. As a result, each month fell by 1, 3, and 4 cents compared with the morning closing price. It was found that Gengfeng sold 4,850 packages, Tongji 700 packages, Yukang 700 packages, Dafeng 1,300 packages, Changyu 1,150 packages, Renfeng 1,150 packages, Yuanda 1,100 packages, Runkang 1,050 packages, Fukang 650 packages, and Yichang 600 packages.

<p>Futures Cotton Lacks Vitality</p>
<p>The cotton market has no distinction between honor and disgrace. The situation in the market is extremely loose. Both long and short parties have little vitality, and there is a tendency to stand by and watch. Therefore, the power of hovering is getting stronger. At the same time, the needs of the current cotton mill are stagnant, and the people's hearts are even more difficult to excite.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Trading Awaiting</p>
<p>The standard cotton front cloth opened, and the Osaka Sanpin flowers also fell due to the decline in the British and Indian cotton markets. The people's hearts are quite empty, and each month is falling, but the market price is extremely tired, and there is no brilliance at all. As a result, each month fell by 5 to 10 cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. The cloth market was calm after the market opened in the afternoon. Trading in the market is especially rare, and the market price has not changed much. As a result, January fell by 10 cents compared with the morning closing price, February rose by 1.5 cents, and the forward price did not move. It was found that Yuanda sold 1,600 dan, Juxing 1,000 dan, Yuda 1,300 dan, Dafeng 1,200 dan, Runkang 1,800 dan, Dachang 2,100 dan, Yongda 2,100 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,000 dan, Changhe 3,800 dan, Taichang 2,100 dan, and Fukang 1,300 dan.

The highest and lowest prices for one day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Consumption Tends to Be Depressing</p>
<p>The current cotton mill needs to be stagnant. The source of wealth is that Yao flowers have arrived at 1,950 packages, and Tong flowers have arrived at 1,590 packages.</p>
<p>Osaka Spot Yarn Plummets 17 Yuan</p>
<p>Sanpin Futures Yarn Also Falls 7.8 Yuan</p>

<p>Japanese Yarn Exports Last Year Were 330,000 Packages</p>
<p>In the 25th year, the total amount of export sales of Japanese factory yarn in Shanghai was 330,577 packages, which was a decrease of 51,525 packages compared with 382,102 packages in the previous year, that is, a weak 14%. The sales volume in the first half of the year wrote 162,400 packages, a decrease of 18,543 packages compared with the same period of the previous year, that is, a strong 10%, and the sales volume in the second half of the year was 168,177 packages, a decrease of 32,981 packages, that is, a strong 12%. Now the table is listed on the left again.</p>
<p>Statistics on Yarn Stocks in Shanghai Factories at the End of Last Year</p>
<p>The amount of storage was 16,637 packages</p>
<p>The stock of cotton yarn in the Shanghai Chinese, British and Japanese yarn factories was checked until the end of last year. The stock of Japanese yarn was 1,016 packages, and the stock of Chinese and British yarn was 15,621 packages, totaling 16,637 packages, which was a large increase compared with 6,138 packages at the end of November, of which the Japanese yarn increased by 116 packages, and the Chinese and British yarn increased sharply by 10,389 packages, totaling a large increase of 10,499 packages. The yarn stock in the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange warehouse was only 1,065 packages in mid-November, and increased sharply to 7,940 packages at the end of December, of which 4,300 packages were 10-count backhand coarse yarn, 3,320 packages were 20-count fine yarn, and 240 packages were 16-count yarn. The following is an excerpt of the yarn stock content of Chinese and foreign factories (unit package).</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Poplin Bleached Cloth Prices are Very Firm</p>
<p>Fine Thread and Blank Cloth Raw Materials are Lacking, Sichuan, Guangdong and Shandong are Accumulating to Replenish</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was tired and the thread price was still very firm. The roots were extremely scarce, and the cotton cloth market was peaceful. The wholesale shops and dyeing factories in this street absorbed about 400 pieces of white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill from eastern goods and local factory goods, and the price was mostly reduced by 5 to 7.5 cents per piece. The demand for coarse cloth was light, but the Guangdong and Yangtze gangs replenished more frequently. The Tianjin gang also had heavy-weight goods entering the stomach, and there was news that the military uniform 16-pound group cloth was about to be launched, and the market atmosphere was slightly invigorated, and the price also tended to be stable. However, the light-colored printed goods and spring poplin bleached cloth are all due to the lack of raw material fine thread and blank cloth. The intent of the Sichuan, Guangdong and Yangtze gangs on the southwest road to enter the goods is becoming stronger, and the Shandong gang on the north road also continues to replenish. The factory has turned out dozens of boxes of new patterns, which can be sold out in four or five days, and the stock is gradually being sold, and the price is very firm. The sales of white goods from the customer gangs are not good. At present, only the Jiangxi gang, Fujian gang, and Guangdong gang are more vivid, and there are no wholesale transactions, and the market is therefore softening.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Shanghai Raw Silk Exports Have Not Improved in Five Years</p>
<p>More Than 13,000 Packages Less Than Last Year</p>
<p>According to the report of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the total number of raw silk exports from Shanghai in the 25th year was 41,446 packages, which was 13,561 packages less than in the 24th year, and only 932 packages more than in the 21st year. The lack of vitality of Chinese silk's foreign trade in the past five years can be imagined. In terms of various raw silks in the past two years, the export of white factory silk was more than 5,000 packages less than in the 24th year, the export of yellow factory silk was more than 1,700 packages less, the export of Qi Li silk was more than 2,300 packages less, and the other silks were reduced by hundreds to more than 1,000 packages. In terms of sales locations, exports to Europe were more than 4,000 packages less than in the previous year, exports to the United States were more than 6,000 packages less than in the previous year, and shipments to Asia and Africa were more than 3,000 packages less. The comparison of the export quantity of Shanghai raw silk in the past five years and the monthly export statistics last year are listed separately on the left for reference (unit package).</p>
<p>Foreign Silk Returned to Calm After Exhilaration</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market continued to play out, and spot futures rose and fell against each other, but the rise and fall were very small (it is estimated that the spot rose by 5 yuan and the future trade fell by 7 yuan). After the foreign silk market has been excited once recently, the situation has become clear again, so the sales of foreign village silk in Shanghai yesterday were extremely quiet, and only Xinfu had a few transactions. The stomach of the Indian village also seems to be satisfied, so there is no movement. The user silk Hangbang has slightly purchased the package amount is also fresh, and the market is quite stable. A total of 40 packages were sold yesterday.</p>
<p>British and Dutch Tea Merchants Discuss Further Restrictions on Production</p>
<p>According to the estimate of the London International Tea Industry Federation, the world's black tea production in the last year was about 40 million dan based on the pound index. There is no significant difference in the consumption of various countries such as France, the United States, Poland, and Italy, but the sales volume in the Soviet Union has been sharply reduced compared with previous years. For this reason, the British market has a large inventory of black tea in the hands of merchants, especially Indian tea. Now British tea merchants have notified Dutch East India and Java tea merchants to further discuss strict restrictions on the amount of black tea production this year. It is said that it has been decided to prohibit the picking of tea in the three or four counties, so that the production can be reduced by 30%, so as to achieve a balance between supply and demand and maintain the foundation of the tea industry.</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Hedging Shorts and Buying Together, Flour is Firm Again</p>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the market in each month presented a consistent rebound, because the price of foreign wheat, the Chicago and Canada rain wheat markets were mixed, May was soft due to more floating positions, and the rest of the months rose, the public bought in, the weather was bad, the price fell 125 to rise 625, the rise and fall in Canada was also slight, and Liverpool fell 1 penny zero. When it opened at the beginning, the people's hearts were still unstable. The opening price of this month was 3.97 yuan, but it has been falling miserably for days. The short heads have been thinking of hedging, and the factory's lots have also been recovered one after another, so the national price has risen to 4.005 yuan. Therefore, the February issue also rose by 4 cents, and the March and April issues also followed up by 12 cents. After that, the recent period in each market has been hedging shorts, and the far period has continued to be taken in by outsiders, so it has continued to be better by 12 cents. Forced to open in the afternoon, because of the purchase by outsiders, although it continued to rise by 12 cents, the settlement is approaching, the customer gang has not had a smooth absorption, and some floating positions have returned, and the market has turned flat again. In the end, only 234 cents were increased. In terms of the recent situation, the market can only stand firm if the actual sales are active.</p>
<p>Wheat Price Brought Up by Flour in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Chen Wheat is Better by Seven or Eight Points</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened yesterday morning, the market in each month showed a trend of falling first and then rising. Trading in each month was still smooth when the market opened. The prices rose and fell against each other. Although there was a rise and fall of 123 points in the current month to April, the new wheat in June was very soft, and fell by 56 points. When the market opened in the afternoon, each month saw a strong rebound, and the people's hearts were brought up again because of the flour market's rebound and high prices. When the buying atmosphere was strong, the near and far periods were raised by 78 points. However, although the people's hearts are good, the trend is not serious. The new wheat in June is also better than 56 points in the morning, and there is no rise or fall compared with the previous week. The current wheat market is still stable, and it has been raised by 13 points compared with the previous week. The opening of Bengbu wheat is 6.5 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat is 6.4 yuan, and more than 10,000 packages have been opened, which were handled by Shen Dafu Xinfufeng.</p>
<p>The Main Destination of the Guest Xian Rice is This Street</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of guest rice was still soft. The owners of each machine rice and brown rice of the guest xian rice are mainly to settle as soon as possible because the Cantonese sales have stopped, this street is not greedy and the source is endless. The South continued to be tired and lifeless. Because the Shanjutou on the street is fighting for the machine yuan rice, although there are only more than 1,000 packages, but in this silence, there is such an activity, and the market price immediately returned to a similar opening price with the highest price last week. Each machine-made brown glaze is still tired due to the light. Throughout the day, 700 packages of Wenermi rice, 926 packages of Xiang rice, and 3,000 packages of Gan rice were digested, mainly on this street, followed by oil, and both Cantonese and Quanzhou were just decorations.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of thirty or so numbers of sources from each gang arrived, and a total of 6,000 stones of goods arrived, including seventeen or eight numbers of thin rice. The sales field was both retail and bulk stomach, and they were still flat. Baowei Qingdao Yantai Gang handled more than 2,000 packages of thin rice, so the situation was still difficult to invigorate. The market was still stable due to the rare arrival due to rain. The market for thin rice still did not rise or fall. Hou Geng was observing from the shopkeeper, and there were few inquiries, and the price was reduced by a few more points. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan were still flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about twenty-one or two numbers of goods arrived from various places in Hexia. The sales of each good in the market are normal. The white geng market was short of nearly a cent in the early market. In the afternoon market, shop stomach and scattered hoarders continued to trade, and the market situation turned stable. The early thin rice was flat and the price was stable. The white yuan was actively sold, and the market price stood firm. The Yin Yuan goods were scarce and beautiful. Each xian and other goods had no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>Foreign Village Sesame is Still Solid</p>
<p>Yellow Soybeans Followed Dalian's Decline</p>
<p>Foreign village sesame once opened at 15.15 yuan, and then fell to 15.1 yuan due to the downward revision of the standard. It is said that 700 tons were traded before and after, but until the previous yesterday, it was still solid, and the market was not easy to cast aside cheaply, so under the successive cicada of the stomach, the sales price still maintained 15.15 yuan, and 500 tons were traded, which was taken by Dafu alone. Yellow soybeans followed Dalian's plunge. Yesterday, Sipin Street soy opened at 6.11 yuan, and the oil mills handled 12 vehicles. The other situation was still stable, and the destination was Fuzhou This Street, etc. The total market transaction was 1,600 to 1,700 packages of each bean.</p>

<h3>Wartime Finance</h3>
<p>— Xi Dongshen</p>
<p>(Continued from the 13th)</p>
<p>In response to the necessities of food, clothing, housing and transportation, all luxuries should no longer be enjoyed. The wealth tax can transfer this surplus manpower and financial resources to the government. This kind of wealth tax, such as income tax, real estate tax, and wartime profit tax, often uses cumulative numbers to make it difficult for the people to lose money. It does not depend on fixed components, but on the greatest extent of financial resources. Therefore, the government can obtain a large amount of income in a precise way. At the same time, tax collection reduces people's consumption and increases people's production. The government has not created credit and unilaterally increased its purchasing power, so the country can avoid currency and credit inflation. Therefore, general financial managers advocate that wartime taxation should be based on direct wealth tax as the most rationalized main tax.</p>
<p>However, the government must go through considerable procedures and some time to collect any taxes, especially the new taxes adopted. For example, the income tax regulations promulgated by our country now must take some time before a large amount of income can be incorporated into the national treasury. When military needs are urgent, it is by no means possible to stop military affairs due to tax revenue shortages. During this period of non-connection, we have to adopt the method of raising debts, which can immediately collect a large amount of funds to meet emergency needs, that is, to turn the fractions of future tax revenue into the current integers for advance use. The advantage of public bonds is that they can raise huge amounts of money in a very short period of time, and impose the burden of public bonds on the general taxpayers in the next few years. People who purchase public bonds see writing as an investment, and do not feel that it is a fish burden to wait for war. Even the general public will not have any resistance or resentment, and the government can also start with the original plan to increase taxes. However, borrowing is really a temporary expedient. Compared with increasing taxes, it is always less beneficial and more harmful. Some people think that borrowing has not increased their burden, so they do not reduce the consumption of their property. At the same time, they can sit in a car and earn interest on public bonds, so they do not have to work harder on extra work. As a result, one is to exploit the wealth that the country can use during wartime, and the other is to reduce the existing capital and hinder the economic prosperity of future generations. People who should be in charge of public bonds often do not advocate thrift, but use bank credit for turnover, which creates credit inflation and promotes price increases. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Biographies</p>
<h3>Remembering Tang Youren</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Tang Youren's one-year memorial was held on December 25th of last year. Recalling the past, when he was shot and killed by thugs in Shanghai, I couldn't help but feel sorrow for a long time. Now, a year has passed in a flash. I am writing down some anecdotes about his childhood and studies in Japan.</p>
<p>During the Dingwei year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, the Shanghai Sanyu School moved from Meifu Lane to the left side of Xinza Shubin Bridge. The new buildings were spacious, and more students came to study there. At that time, the teachers included Wang Zhiheng from my hometown, Wang Chaoren from Shanghai, Wang Menglu, Cai Pizhi from Fengjing, and myself. Among the students, those whom I can still remember include Weng Zhihua from Changshu, the Jiang brothers Bao Li and Bao Lian from Shanghai, and Tang Youren and Tang Lin, along with their younger brother Tang Mu, all of whom were outstanding young men. Youren was the son of Tang Caichang from Liuyang, so Wang Zhiheng paid special attention to nationalism and valuable revolutionary historical traces when teaching civics. After each lesson, he would have Youren recite it aloud. Wang's reading had a loud and extraordinary tone, and Youren could imitate it well. The classmates all called it the "Wang tone," which was a great story.</p>
<p>Later, he went to Japan to study at Keio University, majoring in political economy. He resided in the Shimizu house in Mandacho, Kanda Bridge, Tokyo. Those who associated with him included Xu Yuqing from my hometown (this gentleman also passed away two years ago), Pan Gongbi, and Dai Kexie from Zhejiang. After class, Youren liked to wear Japanese clothes and was fluent in Japanese. Those who didn't know him wouldn't recognize him as a student studying in Japan. He was naturally inclined to quietness and was skilled in chess. Yuqing often played against him but couldn't win. Sometimes, he would drink and although he would drink until late at night, or even seemed drunk, his expression never changed. When discussing national affairs, he would often become agitated and excited, almost stamping his feet, but Youren never revealed the slightest emotion; his mind was deep, and his silence hid things that ordinary people could not fathom.</p>
<h3>The Newspaper King, Hearst</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Anyone knows that the newspaper industry in the United States is more developed than in any other country in the world. When we talk about the American newspaper industry, we immediately think of the American newspaper king, Hearst. Mr. Hearst is indeed an authority in the American newspaper industry. He runs as many as twenty-eight newspapers, spread all over the United States.</p>
<p>Hearst has been engaged in the newspaper industry for fifty years, devoting his entire life to it. Although he is now in his twilight years, his efforts in the newspaper industry are no less than in the past. He knows everything, even about extremely minor issues, and he can handle people and things very appropriately.</p>
<p>The articles published in the newspaper, especially the more important ones, must be reviewed and signed by him before they can be printed. So, not to mention anything else, just the act of signing takes up much of his time. Therefore, some people may suspect that his own published articles are perhaps written by someone else, and he just signs his name, not writing them himself. In fact, all the works that he has signed were written by his own hand.</p>
<p>Hearst mostly writes articles at night because he has many things to do during the day, including organizational, economic, administrative, publishing, advertising, and printing issues related to the newspaper. Even the printing of photos, no matter how trivial, must be decided by him alone. After dealing with so many things during the day, he naturally has no time to write; as for the night, it is relatively quiet, and he is in his own home, and the children are all asleep, so there is no disturbance, making it the best time to write. Therefore, most of the articles he publishes in the newspaper are written at night.</p>
<p>He is not only a leading newspaper publisher, but also has considerable literary cultivation. Therefore, he is now preparing to set aside some of his spare time to write a few literary works.</p>
<h3>The Two Ministers Zhang</h3>
<p>— Zhen Xiang</p>
<p>Four years ago, I published a short piece in the "People" column called "The Two Ministers Zhang." At that time, Zhang Naiyan was appointed as the minister to Belgium, and Zhang Xinhai was the minister to Portugal. The letters of appointment had just been issued, and they were preparing their luggage to go abroad to assume their new positions. Time is like a movie, and after four years, the "Two Ministers Zhang" are truly making people feel the changes between then and now.</p>
<p>Zhang Naiyan stirred up some humorous stories in Belgium, which foreign newspapers described in a way that was really inconvenient to translate into our national language. In a few more days, perhaps we will use a kind of writing that contains no attack at all to lightly describe them, leaving them for future generations to learn from.</p>
<p>Zhang Xinhai was originally a Counselor in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and had considerable experience. Therefore, he transferred from Portugal to become the minister to Czechoslovakia, and also served as the minister to Poland. When serving as the minister to Poland, Mrs. Zhang, Han Xiangmei, won some international acclaim by lecturing on the literature of small countries. When they were in the country, the couple had a great interest in literature and served as professors in the Foreign Literature Department of Central University at the same time, which was greatly trusted by the students.</p>
<p>Zhang Naiyan returned home early; Zhang Xinhai was recently dismissed by Zhang Yuejun due to a case, and it is said that he will also return home soon. The successor to Zhang Xinhai is Wei Chenzu, the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs during the early Republic. Some people also say: The reason for Zhang Xinhai's dismissal was really to take the blame for others, and perhaps he can spend his time writing overseas for the time being. Their couple often publishes articles in foreign magazines, and their monthly income is very substantial, but they also spend it very lavishly!</p>

<h3>What I Know About Wang Yuanzhong</h3>
<p>— Mu Mu</p>
<p>Wang Yuanzhong is the current professor of the School of Liberal Arts at Shanghai Great China University, as well as the director of the Chinese Department of the Higher Normal Division. Three years ago, I took his class for two years. During these two years, he never missed a single hour, nor did he leave early or arrive late. Absence, early departure, and late arrival are the modern diseases of university professors, but he is not modern enough. When lecturing, he always closes his eyes and speaks eloquently in standard Mandarin, which is very loud. In the classroom with more than a hundred people, there is almost no sound at all. If there is any sound, he immediately opens his eyes wide and looks at it. Someone asked him why he closed his eyes. He said that he usually read too much, and that Zuo Zongtang often closed his eyes as well. The courses he teaches, such as classics, can also arouse interest, because he has many allusions, which he often quotes, especially those familiar with history. He never brings a notebook when taking notes in class. Even a thousand or so words are based on memory. One day, a student asked him the names of the thirty-six commanderies of the Qin Dynasty, and he wrote them down without hesitation. His clothes are very simple, his behavior is very casual, and he doesn't seem to be good at socializing, but some people say that he has also worn suits and danced, which I don't quite believe. He also has a special thing. He has never written a sentence in colloquial Chinese, nor has he written a simplified character, but he himself says that he likes to read modern novels, especially those by Lu Xun and Guo Moruo. His writing is particularly archaic. Once, he wrote a biography for someone, in which there were several sentences such as "going to Ning... making system...", which we read and were all confused. Later we realized that it was the previous wish and the meaning of wearing a raincoat, which I still remember. The characters are mostly written in the ancient style, full of retro colors, but he always says to people that the writing should be popular. Isn't this too contradictory? Maybe it's just a way of speaking for our young people, and he has to be like this. I have seen quite a few people recently, but the most profound impression is still him.

<h3>Tea Masters in Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Delin</p>
<p>Tea master is a specific title. It definitely does not mean that he has a tea capacity like that of Ruanyu Chun, who is drunk after one bucket or one stone, or that he is used to eating Wuyi tea leaves that cost more than ten dollars per ounce. Tea master is actually a unique honorary title for the leisurely class in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Their daily life, from sunrise to sunset, is spent in tea houses, except for eating at home. So, what is so fascinating about Suzhou's tea houses that makes people linger and forget to return? According to a friend of mine who holds the title of Jinshi, there are various typical characters in Suzhou's tea houses, such as outdated merchants, near-sighted Confucian scholars,纨绔 young men, perhaps frustrated soldiers, and frustrated politicians.

<h3>Replaced Nest of Luan Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10 (Yellow Flowers Add Sorrow to Withered Autumn Hearts; Plain Silk Handkerchief Conveys Entanglement and Wondrous Texts Cast Mistakes)</p>
<p>Finally, he finally figured out what it meant. He wrote on the paper: "Buddha is naturally not worthy, flowers, moon, and snow are also not comparable to ordinary people, but the intention is appreciable." After writing it, he held it in both hands and considered it for a while, feeling that there was no other way but to imitate Guoqi's style, both above and below the signature. Therefore, he folded the eight-line note in double layers and placed it in the middle drawer, next to that letter. Originally, Youmei could have taken that letter away. But after holding it in her hand and weighing it twice, she felt it was inappropriate. The envelope said "Knowing You, Sir", and this "Knowing You, Sir" might not necessarily be Jiang Menglan, so she put the letter back down and closed the drawer. Standing up, she was about to leave. But the first thought in her mind came up. There were many manuscripts in his drawer. If she randomly folded a manuscript in it, how would he know when he came back? So, she slowly sat down and touched her right face, thinking for a while. After all, he was pleased with what he was doing, and she could easily think of a way. She took out a floral silk handkerchief from her body, shook it twice in the air, and a very strong fragrance was sent into her nose. She smiled to herself, opened the drawer, and inserted the handkerchief into it. But after inserting the handkerchief, she immediately thought it was quite inappropriate. This kind of practice could easily make people think that it was lost in the drawer, not deliberately placed in the drawer. So she opened the drawer, took out the handkerchief, folded it into a square piece, and placed it in the drawer. Underneath the handkerchief was the note she wrote herself. If Guoqi could be surprised by this handkerchief, the note would immediately reach his eyes. Holding the table, she zoned out for a while, seemingly still feeling that it was inappropriate. So she opened the drawer for the third time and slowly dragged out one corner of the floral silk handkerchief, draping it over the edge of the drawer. As she closed the drawer, part of the floral silk handkerchief was outside. With this arrangement settled, Youmei walked a few steps away from the table. Turning her head occasionally, feigning indifference, as expected, the corner of the floral silk handkerchief was very clearly seen in her eyes. One hundred and twenty points of unease were considered settled. When she reached the door, she looked back again and left happily. Her practice was well-intentioned and always effective. As usual, Guoqi came back with her at four o'clock in the afternoon. After entering the room, he didn't care at first. Later, when Mama Duan brought water in and told him that Miss Li had come again. She sat at the desk for a long time and wrote a note. Guoqi said that she had written a note, so he looked at the desk. He saw that the inkstone pool had moved, and a pen with a cap on it was also placed on the inkstone. (124)</p>
<h3>Anecdotes about Mr. Duan Zhiquan</h3>
<p>— Hefei Native</p>
<p>Former executive Duan Zhiquan passed away in Shanghai, and recently his funeral was held in Ping, with preparations for a state funeral. Everyone knows about Mr. Duan's achievements in creating the Republic, participating in the European War, and serving in important military and national positions for decades; now I will add some of the forgotten anecdotes about Mr. Duan, for people to understand more fully:</p>
<p>Mr. Duan was from Hefei. His former residence was in Taogang, on the outskirts of Xiqiao in the western suburbs of Hefei, more than fifty miles from the city. The thatched cottage had several rooms, barely sheltering from the wind and rain, located between Mount Dashu and Mount Zipeng, with a secluded and scenic view. After Mr. Duan became prominent, his family repeatedly asked to elevate the gate and acquire more land, but he did not allow it. His younger brother, Bixiang, bought some thin fields and renovated the residence, but compared with the residences of other prominent families in Hefei, it was still far inferior.</p>
<p>Mr. Duan had two younger brothers: the second was named Biqing, and the youngest was named Ziyou. Biqing lived in the countryside and engaged in farming. After Mr. Duan became successful, he still carried a hoe on the ridges and associated with farmers and old men in the fields. Those who met him at first did not know that he was the younger brother of the dignified executive. Mr. Duan was devoted to fraternal affection. Biqing was sure to visit the public every year, but he gave nothing. Each time, he only gave travel expenses of fifty yuan and household expenses of two hundred yuan. Biqing lived in the countryside and liked to resolve difficulties for people. Mr. Duan warned him: "Resolving difficulties is a beautiful thing; now that I am noble, you are my younger brother, and those who are wrong will use my power to bully them. Don't do it again," his integrity, frugality, and humility were like this. The youngest followed the Duke in Beiyang for a long time and learned some business. He cooperated with others to operate the Jingxing Coal Mine, not only did not burden the Duke, but also sometimes used the surplus to consult on the Duke's poverty.</p>
<p>Mr. Duan had great ambitions when he was young. At first, he joined the Ming Army—that is, the army of Duke Liuzhuangsu—as a scribe in a certain camp. Soon, Duke Li Wenzhong founded the Military Academy and ordered the various armies to recommend outstanding children to study at the school. Mr. Duan's team entered the school as a recommendee of the 鍩 Army, which was the beginning of Mr. Duan's involvement in the army.</p>
<p>Mr. Duan was always at the top of the list in the Military Academy. At that time, Li Wenzhong was determined to create a new army and sent students to study in Germany. Mr. Duan was selected for his excellent grades and outstanding qualifications. Because Mr. Duan was good at arithmetic, he studied artillery and practiced in the Krupp artillery factory for several years. Mr. Duan was the first Chinese to study artillery in Germany.</p>
<p>Mr. Duan was usually taciturn and rarely smiled, but his aura was heavy and steady. His eyes were bright and piercing, like electric lights, making people dare not look at him directly. He had a nickname called "Crooked Nose Zi," but his nose was usually very straight, which did not match the nickname at all. Only before he was extremely angry would his nose slightly slant, and those around him always looked at his nose to see his joy and anger, without any mistakes. The origin of his nickname was probably like this. Mr. Duan also had a nickname called "Tooth Pot"—Tianjin dialect means a slightly protruding back—which was very similar, but people did not call him that.</p>
<p>During Yuan Xiangcheng's time in Beiyang, Mr. Duan, Wang Shizhen, and Feng Guozhang were all his subordinates. At that time, they were known as the "Three Heroes of Beiyang," and there was also a saying: "The Three Heroes of Beiyang are Dragon, Tiger, and Dog," meaning that Mr. Duan was the Tiger, Wang was the Dragon, and Feng was the Dog. Unexpectedly, the Dog's position turned out to be above the Dragon and the Tiger. (Feng once served as the President, Mr. Duan was the Temporary Executive, and Wang never tasted the flavor of leadership.)</p>
<p>Mr. Duan pledged to himself that he would not plant parties or engage in private matters, so he never promoted his hometown people or old friends during his decades of important military and national positions. Even if relatives and friends sought help, he only helped with money and did not give them positions. However, he was quite partial to his outstanding students, believing that all the talents in the world were already within his walls, which was also one of Mr. Duan's shortcomings.</p>
<p>Mr. Duan was good at chess, but he was not as good as his eldest son, Yu Junliang. Whenever Junliang accompanied him in chess: if Junliang won, he would scold him, "You can't do anything else, you only know how to play chess." If he lost, he would also scold him, "You can't even master chess, let alone other things." Whenever Junliang waited to play chess, he was always trembling and didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>Mr. Duan was most calm in the face of danger. During the war of the National Protection Army, both the east and west routes were defeated, and the Zhili Army was approaching the city. At that time, people from the so-called Anfu clique, such as Zeng Yujun, Li Sihao, and Liang Hongzhi, all hid in the Japanese barracks in the East Jiaomin Lane. Mr. Duan was the only one who lived alone in the Garrison Headquarters on Hubu Street, and played chess as usual. Those around him advised him to surrender to Jiaowa Lane, but he angrily rebuked them. However, the rebellious generals and powerful feudal lords at that time could do nothing to him.</p>
<p>After the "September 18th Incident," Mr. Duan lived in a private residence in Tianjin. One day, a person from a certain country asked to see him and presented him with a gold cigarette case, which, when opened, contained a check for 500,000 yuan. Mr. Duan quickly and solemnly returned it, saying: "You are mistaken." Wen sent the guest away, and soon came south. Therefore, when he died at sea, the people of the country were all saddened and admired him.</p>

<h3>All National Medicine Stores in the French Concession Struck Yesterday to Protest Against Unjust Levies</h3>
<p>Pharmaceutical Association Issues Declaration - Urgent Meeting Convened Today</p>
<p>All national medicine stores in the French Concession of this city went on strike at 3 p.m. yesterday due to the French Municipal Council's forced collection of the "Chinese Medicine Retail Sales Regulations Fee," which has no legal basis, and its use of water and electricity cuts as a means of oppression. The National Pharmaceutical Association has issued a declaration and scheduled an urgent representative meeting for 2 p.m. today at the Ningbo Association to discuss countermeasures. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process</p>
<p>Last summer, the French Municipal Council of this city initiated the collection of a "Chinese Medicine Sales Regulations Fee," ranging from ten to twenty-five yuan. The national medicine stores in the French Concession believed that this fee had no precedent and that they could not afford it during this time of economic recession. They jointly submitted a request to the French authorities to consider the difficulties of the businesses and withdraw the order. They also asked the French Concession Taxpayers' Association to fight for them. Although the Taxpayers' Association mediated at one point, it ultimately failed to resolve the matter due to the wide gap between the parties. Recently, the Municipal Council notified the medicine stores that the fee must be paid by January 12, otherwise water and electricity would be cut off. The Pharmaceutical Association, recognizing the urgency of the situation, sent another letter to the Municipal Council, requesting that it not resort to cutting off water and electricity to avoid causing serious incidents. However, the French Municipal Council replied, rejecting the Association's request and stating that the business tax was implemented according to the French Municipal Council's regulations and that all other businesses in the French Concession must comply. It requested that the payment be made quickly according to the specified amount, showing no sincerity in withdrawing the order.</p>
<p>Triggering a Strike</p>
<p>Because the medicine stores refused to pay, the French Municipal Council suddenly ordered the French-owned Water and Electricity Company to send personnel at 3 p.m. yesterday to cut off the water and electricity of the Baxianju, Darentang, Guangshengye, and other medicine stores. Upon hearing the news, the national medicine stores in the area were outraged by the oppression and, within an hour, went on strike in solidarity. The announcement posted on their doors after the strike is recorded below: "Due to the French Municipal Council's strange levy of the Chinese Medicine Retail Sales Regulations Fee, which has no legal basis, and its oppression by cutting off water and electricity, we are going on strike to help and urge the Standing Committee to realize the situation. However, for the sake of the sick, prescriptions will still be filled. Shanghai National Pharmaceutical Industry Association." According to reporters' investigations along the Avenue Edward VII, the medicine stores painfully closed their doors and went on strike, feeling very angry. After hearing the news, the French Municipal Council sent police to tear down the strike notices posted in front of the medicine stores, but they were soon reposted by the Association.</p>
<p>Urgent Meeting</p>
<p>After the strike occurred, the standing committee members of the Association consulted once and decided to convene an urgent meeting of representatives from the industry throughout the city this afternoon to discuss effective countermeasures. Their notice is recorded below: "Tomorrow (the 19th) at 2 p.m., a representative meeting of the national pharmaceutical industry throughout the city will be held at the Ningbo Association on Yu Qiaqing Road. We hope that you will send one or two representatives to attend on time. This is an urgent notice."</p>
<p>Declaration Issued</p>
<p>The Association issued a special declaration stating that the French Concession Municipal Council suddenly announced the collection of a Chinese Medicinal Material and Medicine Sales Regulations Fee last summer, ranging from 25 to 10 yuan per year. The collection was urgent, and the national medicine stores in the area were running around in fear. They believed that the fee not only had no legal basis but was also unbearable during this time of commercial recession and financial strain. They requested the Association to argue on the basis of reason and strive to cancel the fee to avoid harassment. The Association not only sent two letters but also sent representatives to the bureau for negotiations. They were not received and received no reply. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession mediated once, but due to the wide gap, it was ultimately unsuccessful and the matter was delayed. As the end of the year approached, at a time when business was busy, the bureau sent Chinese personnel to threaten to cut off water and electricity, forcing the stores to pay within a time limit. The stores in the area did not owe any water or electricity fees, so why cut them off without reason? They were unwilling to submit to the illegal slaughter and were equally indignant at the bullying by barbaric means. Therefore, at two emergency meetings on the 8th and 9th of this month, it was decided that if the bureau disregarded the legal rights of Chinese taxpayers and insisted on barbaric oppression to achieve its desires, the stores in the area would go on strike and resist, determined to fight to the end. However, based on the principle of pacifying people, a letter was sent by all the stores in the area, and the Association sent a letter with gentle words of persuasion, hoping to avert the crisis. These sincere intentions were rejected, and yesterday the French authorities used the usual technique of oppressing Chinese taxpayers by cutting off electricity. The stores in the area will naturally promote, respond, and deal with the situation step by step. Therefore, the strike of all the national medicine stores has also been forced to be realized, enduring the greatest pain to seek relief for our Chinese taxpayers, fighting for personality without compromise, and looking forward to the preservation of justice. This is hereby announced for your consideration.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Issues Order Restricting Grain Prices</h3>
<p>Investigate Speculation and Manipulation - Immediate Strict Punishment</p>
<p>Because grain prices have soared recently, affecting the people's food supply, the Shanghai Social Bureau issued Order Hai Zi No. 362 yesterday, ordering all grain trade unions and grain exchanges in the city to restrict soaring grain prices. The original text of the order reads: "It has been found that grain prices have soared recently, which has greatly affected the food supply of the citizens.

In addition to sending personnel to thoroughly investigate whether there is any speculation or manipulation, anyone found to be involved will be punished immediately. It is hereby ordered that the trade union (exchange) comply and strictly restrict soaring grain prices in order to emphasize the importance of the people's food supply.

<h3>Mr. Jin Shichun, Overseas Chinese Labor Comfort Representative from Nanyang, Talks About Recent Conditions on the Border</h3>
<p>Our soldiers' morale is high, defense is solid, and the pseudo-bandits have no way out. Soldiers have enough clothing, but food and doctors are needed.</p>
<p>Since the pseudo-bandits invaded the border area of ​​Suiyuan, the soldiers guarding the territory rose up to resist. People from all walks of life have sent representatives to express their condolences. The overseas Chinese in Nanyang have shown particular sincerity. Jin Shichun, the representative sent by the overseas Chinese in Singapore, and Zhang Demu, the representative sent by the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, returned to China one after another to comfort the soldiers in the front line of Suiyuan. They arrived in Suiyuan at the end of last year, stayed for ten days, and returned to Nanjing the day before yesterday. Mr. Jin Shichun, the representative of Singapore, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency went to interview him. According to Jin, the representatives of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang went to Suiyuan to express their condolences and visited Sui, Gui, Bailing Temple, Da Laj, Pingdi Xi, Zhuozi Mountain Army and other important places. They visited Gui Sui in great detail and stayed for a long time. They received warm receptions from Chairman Fu and Chief of Staff Yuan Qingrong, Commander of the 22nd Brigade Sun Lanfeng, etc., who informed them of everything and led them on visits. We are very grateful for their kindness. The following are what we learned in Suiyuan: ㊀ The national army's defense work is extremely solid, the morale is high, and the prospects for the war of resistance are optimistic. ㊁ There were more than 100 wounded soldiers in the Suiyuan Comfort Hospital at that time, and the hospital conditions were good. ㊂ The war in northern Suiyuan seems to have come to an end, while there are very small-scale contacts in eastern Suiyuan from time to time. It is said that the pseudo-bandits are very busy with conscription. Our army's position is solid and there is no need to worry. ㊃ There are many troops from the pseudo side who have revolted. Although a certain side is now trying its best to instigate trouble, they all know that we are promoting loyalty and courage, and it seems that they have no way out. ㊄ All the female students of the Shanxi Provincial Women's Normal School organized a nursing team and requested Chairman Fu to serve in the hospital. Fu was afraid of interfering with their studies and repeatedly dissuaded them to no avail. As a result, it was decided that one class would be rotated every month, with each class consisting of more than 20 people. They have now begun to serve, led by Song Weijing, the representative of the Shanxi Women's Association. These female students have all received nursing training and are very respectable. ㊅ The market in Suiyuan Province is still good. Because there are many troops, the price of fur has increased, about twice as much as last year. Jin also told reporters that Chairman Fu once said that in this war of resistance, our army has deaths and injuries, but no one showed a sad expression at the time, and all were willing to die for the country. The monthly allowance for the soldiers at the front is very meager. All donations have been kept by the Joint Army-Civilian Association and are subject to the Central Government's discretion. A publication is published every day to report the income of goods and money. The reporter then asked Jin about the needs of the front line. According to him, the clothes and other items donated by various parties are sometimes not very suitable. From my observation, the soldiers at the front have enough clothes, and what they need now are food and fewer doctors in the hospital. After Jin returned to Shanghai, he sent a detailed letter reporting the situation of his visit to Suiyuan to the overseas Chinese in Nanyang, who were very concerned about the soldiers in Suiyuan, and then returned to Singapore on a regular basis to explain everything in detail.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Students Anti-Enemy and National Salvation Alliance Telegraphs the Central Government to Punish Traitors and Resist the Enemy</h3>
<p>Punish the Culprits of the Shaanxi Incident and Suppress the Rebels, and Then Gather National Strength to Resist the Enemy and Save the Nation</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the students of universities and middle schools in this city, in view of the increasingly serious internal and external troubles, have successively elected representatives to organize the Shanghai Students Anti-Enemy and National Salvation Alliance. Yesterday, they issued a circular telegram, advocating that the central government be requested to punish the culprits of the Shaanxi Incident, suppress the rebels, and then gather national strength to resist the enemy and save the nation. The full text of the circular telegram is recorded below. All newspapers are requested to forward it to the compatriots of the whole country for their information. It was recently presented to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Military Commission. The telegram reads: (Omitted titles) Looking back, when the victories in defending against foreign insults on the border were repeatedly reported, and the national sentiment of resisting the enemy was extremely enthusiastic, unfortunately, there was a rebellion in Xi'an that hijacked the leader and advocated heresies to destroy unity. All Chinese people are indignant. The central government, in order to allow the criminals to repent and start anew, has tentatively allowed self-renewal and the scope of lenient peace is unprecedented. If Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng had a conscience, they should be grateful for the nation's grace and obey government orders. However, they acted perversely and went further down the wrong path. The central government's clear and bright orders were ignored, and the representatives traveled back and forth as if they were enemies. Where is the discipline? Where is the credibility? Resisting the enemy in this way is only enough to cause shame. Saving the nation in this way will only lead to destruction. What Zhang and Yang advocated in the past and where they will go in the future, is not to resist Japan and save the country, but to unite with Russia and tolerate communism. Is it not to stop the civil war, but to create a people's front? In fact, they are colluding with the bandits, holding troops and occupying territory, obeying the Third International, and destroying national unity. Who will they deceive by saying that they are resisting Japan? During the Shenyang Incident, they fled without a fight. The title of "General of Non-Resistance" is known to women and children. During the Battle of the Great Wall, Zhang Xueliang was stationed in Hebei and Jehol, perfunctorily fulfilling his responsibilities, indulging in his territory, and failing to resist effectively. He did not resist when he should have resisted, and he did not resist when there was an opportunity to resist. He said that the troops who were in the remote northwest and found it difficult to suppress the bandits could be led by the General of Non-Resistance to ask for battle against Japan. It is really a dream. As for stopping the civil war, it is like a glib tongue. If you do not think about it, since the founding of the Republic of China, there have been civil wars, such as the Zhili-Fengtian War, the Zhili-Anhui War, the Qi-Lu War, and the several battles against the National Army, which exhausted the national strength. Which one was not directly or indirectly initiated by Zhang's father and son? Since the resolution of the Liangguang Incident, the whole country has celebrated the completion of peace and unity, diplomacy has become stronger, and Suiyuan has been able to win. However, Zhang Xueliang, with the ambition of a wolf, was confused by heresies and took the initiative to rebel, clearly creating war, but using "stopping the civil war" as a name, trying to force the central government to succumb to the rebels and accommodate the communists. The toxicity of his calculation cannot be overstated. If the central government sanctions him, he will be accused of civil war. If the central government is lenient with him, he will threaten with accommodating the communists. Under the slogan of "stopping the civil war," only warlords are allowed to occupy territory and resist orders, and the central government cannot sanction rebels. Only the communists are allowed to harass the people, and the central government cannot eliminate bandits. There is no such thing as saving the country in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad. If we talk about uniting with Russia, it is even more ridiculous. Regardless of whether or not Soviet Russia should be united with today, or whether or not it can be united with, who was the first to enlighten Soviet Russia? In the dispute over the Chinese Eastern Railway in the 19th year of the Republic of China, he arbitrarily mobilized troops and broke off diplomatic relations. It was Zhang Xueliang who acted rashly at that time. He suddenly mobilized troops and suddenly stopped fighting, indulging in his own way, losing national sovereignty, and incurring the hatred of Soviet Russia and the surveillance of the Japanese. The disaster of the "September 18th Incident" originated from this. How can a person who is so impulsive and acts emotionally be said to be able to understand the international situation and determine diplomatic strategies? The theory of accommodating the communists is even more absurd. He was originally ordered to suppress the bandits, but he was unable to suppress them. He secretly colluded with the bandits. Knowing that colluding with the bandits is a bad name, he created the term "accommodating the communists" to cover it up. He does not know that if the communists have a national concept and national awareness, they should abandon the absurd strategy of establishing their own government and setting up their own army and sincerely return to righteousness and serve the country. However, at the time of resisting the enemy in Suiyuan, he created the source of chaos in the northwest, which shows that he is alienated from his birth and has no motherland in his heart. Today, the deceit and suffering of the people in Shaanxi and Gansu are all caused by the word "accommodating the communists." Is it not enough to ruin Shaanxi and Gansu? He wants to drag the whole country into a state of deep water and fire before he is satisfied. According to those who came from Xi'an, Zhang Xueliang once said to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek that the result of resisting the enemy is nothing more than one of three paths: winning, dying, or surrendering. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek criticized Zhang Xueliang in his diary, saying that the path of "surrendering" is shameless. Today, he cannot move the bandits, but he advocates "accommodating the communists." It is no wonder that the enemy has not yet been resisted, but he has already intended to surrender. Such a shameless and spineless rogue actually discusses the affairs of the world, and the central government still repeatedly indulges him. Our association really does not know why the central government rewards the rebels to this extent. As for the people's front, it sounds appealing, but in fact, what our country urgently needs today is national unity, not the separation of the people from the government and the establishment of their own banners. Unity is to be unified in the central government, issuing orders, and having a government, which is the basic condition for constituting a modern country. The people should be the backing of the government, and the country will have strength. It is not allowed to have units standing in a country, each occupying territory, each holding power, and even having different organizations and different flags. The feudal consciousness has not disappeared, and the separatist forms are the same. The intention is nothing more than to protect the communists and seek a way out for them. If it is for resisting the enemy and saving the country, how can this be the right way? In short, Zhang Xueliang and others, thinking that they have troops in their hands and land to plunder, were domineering and outrageous, and thus created the Shaanxi Incident. If our people really want to resist the enemy and save the country, then we should first ask the central government to punish the culprits who have lost their sovereignty, lost their land, committed crimes, and caused chaos in accordance with the law in order to maintain discipline. The other rebel soldiers and generals who are stubborn and unyielding and cannot be reasoned with should also be quickly suppressed to clarify the difference between the rebels and the obedient. Only in this way can heresies not run rampant and the communists can be wiped out. Then we can review the teachers and brigades, join forces to resist the enemy, not only will the border no longer be invaded, but the lost land can also be recovered. At the beginning of the establishment of this alliance, we would like to represent the young students of the entire city of Shanghai, vowing to be the backing of the central government, and earnestly present our words. Please consider this. We also sincerely hope that the whole country will call for it unanimously. The Shanghai Students Anti-Enemy and National Salvation Alliance is hereby announced.</p>
<h3>More Than Ninety Labor Unions Petition the Central Government to Suppress Yang and Yu</h3>
<p>If We Continue to Indulge Them, It Will Cause Trouble</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reported that more than 90 labor unions in the first district of this city, such as water and electricity, telegraphed the central government yesterday because the Shaanxi-Gansu Incident has not yet been resolved, requesting that a clear order be issued to suppress and pacify it on a specific date. The original text reads: The Nanjing Central Executive Committee, the National Government Committee, are hereby informed that the Shaanxi-Gansu Incident has occurred and has lasted for more than ten days. The central authorities have repeatedly been lenient, hoping to seek a solution through peaceful means. However, Yang and Yu and other rebels have hidden their evil intentions and have not shown any remorse. Such defiance and armed rebellion to destroy unity is the greatest enemy of the nation. If we continue to indulge them, it will cause trouble. Therefore, we telegraph to your committee, begging you to issue a clear order to suppress the rebellion and pacify the incident on a specific date in order to warn the wicked and maintain law and order. We are extremely frightened and disturbed by this telegram.

<h3>Prospects for Expanding the Unified National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu's Report at the City Government Memorial Week</p>
<p>Our municipal government held an expanded Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at 9:00 AM yesterday, led by Mayor Wu as chairman. He also gave an important speech titled "Prospects for Expanding the Unified National Salvation Movement." The original text of the speech is excerpted below:</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Comrades, what I want to discuss with you today concerns the unified national salvation movement initiated by the cultural, educational, and business circles of Shanghai. Its declaration was published in the newspapers the day before yesterday, which I believe you have all seen. Today, I will use this as a topic to say a few words.</p>
<p>During the dozen or so days from the Xi'an Incident last December 12th to Chairman Chiang's safe return to Nanjing, the people of the whole country expressed both unanimous anger towards the Xi'an rebels and unanimous love and support for our leader, as if casting a general vote of confidence in the leader. This was the only demonstration of civil rights by the people of the whole country since the beginning of Chinese history, and it was a great progress politically. From this, we know that the future of the Chinese nation has reached a hopeful stage. Therefore, on New Year's Day this year, I told the citizens of Shanghai that the 26th year of the Republic of China is the first year of the Chinese nation's rise, and the first year of the Chinese nation's rise is the first year of hope. However, we can see many precedents in history of "failure for want of one final effort" and "success about to be thrown away." Everything often fails just when it is hopeful, just when it is about to succeed. Therefore, regarding the future of the Chinese nation, now that we know there is hope, we must be more careful and strive harder so that this matter does not "fail for want of one final effort" or "succeed only to be thrown away." The most worthy of our attention and effort is unity. On the one hand, we must pay attention to the last-ditch struggles of all remaining evil forces in the country to destroy unity. On the other hand, we must strive, at any cost, to fundamentally eliminate all obstacles to unity. Otherwise, China's true unity will not be realized. Without unity, the nation has no basis for revival; if the nation cannot revive, it cannot save the country. Therefore, the principals, professors, primary and secondary school principals, faculty, writers, journalists, and business people of various schools in this city have initiated a unified national salvation movement. Its declaration was published in the newspapers the day before yesterday. The unified national salvation movement is urgently needed in China today, and its significance is also very important. If the unified national salvation movement succeeds, the Chinese nation will revive; if it unfortunately fails, the Chinese nation will perish. The importance of this is self-evident. The urgent task for the people of the whole country is to resolve the national crisis and resist foreign aggression. To resolve the national crisis and resist foreign aggression, we must strengthen national power. To strengthen national power, we must rebuild the country. But what kind of country should we build? We should build a country based on the Three Principles of the People. How do we build a country based on the Three Principles of the People? Through the National Economic Construction Movement and the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>㊁ The Necessity of Unity</p>
<p>Unity is national salvation; without unity, there can be no national salvation. The relationship between unity and disunity is so great that unless the obstacles to unity are removed, true unity cannot be realized. Because remnant warlords occupy their own territories, disobey government and military orders, and govern independently, forming a situation of division. In such a situation, the people's lives are oppressed by the feudal system, and their suffering increases day by day. They struggle to survive, so how can they have the remaining strength to contribute to the country's national salvation movement? Therefore, remnant warlords and feudal remnants are obstacles to unity. To achieve true unity, it is necessary to fundamentally eliminate them. To fundamentally eliminate these obstacles and prevent them from ever happening again, on the positive side, we should have a central ideology. The Three Principles of the People is our central ideology for building the country and saving the nation. If we do not establish a central ideology, the will of the people of the whole country will not be unified, and we cannot build the country and save the nation. Secondly, we must strive from our own positions to strengthen our strength and gather the strength of the whole country to create a weapon for our national revolution and to complete our national revolutionary mission. The necessity of unity lies in this.</p>
<p>㊂ The Possibility of Unity</p>
<p>China is the largest and oldest civilized country in the world, with a land area of more than four million square miles and a population of 450 million, accounting for a quarter of the world's population. In a country with such a vast land area and a nation with such a large population, a few people may still doubt whether unity is possible. This must be because they have ulterior motives or have lost their self-confidence. Now, let's look at the following points and we can conclude that China's unity is not only possible but also inevitable:</p>
<p>㊀ In terms of the quality of the nation</p>
<p>The bloodlines, languages, writing systems, customs, and habits of our people are all the same. Although there are Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan distinctions, the differences are diminishing day by day. Now, their interests are shared and their fates are intertwined, and they are truly inseparable. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that we are the Chinese nation formed by the five races of Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan.</p>
<p>㊁ In terms of the historical foundation</p>
<p>Since the Qin Dynasty abolished the feudal system and established prefectures and counties, the foundation for a unified country has been established. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said, "China has always been a large, unified country."</p>
<p>㊂ In terms of the psychology of the people</p>
<p>The Chinese people, whether from the south or the north, have no irreconcilable opinions. This is a unique characteristic that distinguishes them from the federations of other countries. They love peace and yearn for unity, which is the universal psychology of the Chinese people. Mencius' saying, "The world is about to be at peace, and it will be unified," is deeply rooted in the hearts of the Chinese people and is firmly believed.</p>
<p>㊃ In terms of the needs of the times</p>
<p>The characteristic of the Chinese nation is that it is organized and able to unite. In particular, the development of nationalism since the 19th century has been the basis for the establishment of most modern "nation-states." Building the Republic of China with the Chinese nation is in line with the needs of the times.</p>
<p>㊄ In terms of transportation</p>
<p>Since the Qin Dynasty abolished the feudal system, although the outline of a unified country has been roughly established, because the national economy is still stagnating in the era of agricultural self-sufficiency, the people's lives are simple, and the area is vast and transportation is difficult, there is the ancient saying that they do not interact with each other. Now it is very different, and it has entered the era of industrial mutual assistance economy. Transportation is becoming more and more developed. Transportation tools such as ships, railways, highways, and aviation are becoming increasingly complete. China knew it needed unity in the Qin Dynasty, and it still needs unity now, but the methods of unity in the past are not applicable to the present.</p>
<p>㊃ Obstacles to Unity</p>
<p>China has both the necessity and the possibility of unity, but if the obstacles lurking in society and in the people's minds are not removed, although unity is possible, true unity cannot be realized. Even if it can be unified, the content of the unity still does not conform to the methods of a modern state. What are the obstacles to China's unity? In political theory: 1. There is the theory of provincial federation. Those who advocate this theory are remnant warlords and feudal remnants who attempt to maintain a situation of division under the organization of a modern state. These warlords are remnants of the feudal system, occupying local areas and taking everything, including local people, finances, and military power, as their own, oppressing the people and doing whatever they want. If the country is truly unified, they will feel that it is not in their own interests, so even when they are at the end of their rope, they still want to make a last-ditch struggle, using false pretenses to resist the central government. 2. There is the theory of class struggle. Those who advocate this theory are the international communists, who use the working class as a tool to seize political power. In capitalist countries and industrialized societies, the working masses are oppressed and exploited by capitalism, and there may be a need for class struggle in order to alleviate their suffering. However, China is not a capitalist country, and its industry is not developed, so there is no need for class struggle. Moreover, even in capitalist countries and industrialized societies, the means of class struggle have still not achieved the goal of alleviating the suffering of the working masses, so they have shifted from class struggle to labor-capital cooperation. Although China is vast and rich in resources, with endless reserves, most of them have not yet been developed and require large amounts of capital to develop these endless resources and enrich the people's lives. Therefore, we must now encourage investment on the one hand and prevent the harm of capitalist development on the other. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen wanted to regulate capital. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that China does not have great wealth, only great poverty and small poverty. We only need to encourage labor-capital cooperation, not class struggle. Class struggle can only divide the strength of the nation and destroy the unity of the country. 3. There is the theory of the people's front. Those who advocate this theory are also the international communists. The reason why the international communists advocate this theory is to ease the anti-communist atmosphere in various countries around the world and to use it as a smokescreen for the international communists' political maneuvers in various countries. Spain has suffered unprecedented massacres that have not yet subsided. This is a great lesson that the red and black ideologies have given us. Those who promote this theory in China only want to separate the people from the government and destroy the united front of the people and the government working together to save and build the country. Therefore, the people's front is, in China today, a suicidal proposition. As for those shameless traitors who attempt to rely on foreign forces and do not hesitate to betray the country for personal gain, there is no need to talk about theory at all.</p>
<p>㊄ Ways to Unity</p>
<p>There are four ways to unite China:</p>
<p>㊀ Restore National Self-Confidence</p>
<p>To restore the national self-confidence of the people of the whole country, we should, on the negative side, believe that China has thousands of years of glorious history, that our ancestors have made great contributions to world civilization, and that our Chinese nation will never perish. On the positive side, we should believe in the knowledge and ability of the Chinese people and that we are capable of saving the current national crisis and establishing a modern new China. If we want to do this, we must first promote national consciousness and firmly believe in self-reliance.</p>
<p>㊁ Establish a Central Ideology</p>
<p>We must make the people of the whole country unanimously believe that the Three Principles of the People is the most suitable national salvation ideology for China and establish a national salvation theory that adapts to the environment. We must never be swayed by other seemingly plausible or absurd arguments.</p>
<p>㊂ Develop Economic Construction</p>
<p>According to French historian Scignobos, the political evolution of modern European and American countries is the result of material construction and progress. Therefore, if we want to achieve the wealth and power of European and American countries today, we must seek national progress and material construction. However, to seek national progress and material construction, it is impossible to succeed without carrying out large-scale efforts with the unified strength of the entire country. The National Economic Construction Movement is a construction movement that benefits the national economy and the people's livelihood. It can not only consolidate unity but also make the unified country suitable for national survival and the people's improved living standards.</p>
<p>㊃ Support the Supreme Leader</p>
<p>Looking at the history of China and foreign countries, the rise of a nation is never a coincidence. There is always a leader who is supported by the entire nation, using the strength of the entire nation to revitalize the nation and build the country. Then the nation can prosper and the country can be established. Today, our country is very fortunate to have a supreme leader who has received the total vote of confidence from the people of the whole country. From now on, we only need to sincerely support this supreme leader and contribute all our strength and freedom to the country so that our supreme leader can freely use our entire strength to build the country and revive the nation. The current national crisis can be expected to be resolved in the near future. Once the national crisis is resolved, our country can reach the wealth and power of European and American countries today.</p>
<p>In short, the unified national salvation movement initiated by people from all walks of life in Shanghai has extremely important significance. I hope that the 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai will rise up and participate in this movement and that this movement will be expanded to the whole country to punish all the remaining evil forces that destroy unity and consolidate unity. This is the most important plan for national salvation at present.</p>

<h3>All Sectors of the City to Periodically Settle Zhang Xueliang's Crimes of Harming the Country and Ruining the People</h3>
<p>Initiated by the Citizens' Associations of the First and Second Special Districts, Representatives from All Sectors to Convene Discussion on the 21st</p>
<p>—Location: City Chamber of Commerce—</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, citizens from all sectors of the city believe that Zhang Xueliang is a remnant of the warlords and his crimes of harming the country and ruining the people cannot be tolerated. Therefore, the citizens' associations of the first and second special districts jointly initiated a call to convene representatives of all legal entities in the city to discuss the settlement of Zhang Xueliang's crimes of harming the country and ruining the people at the City Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM the day after tomorrow (21st). The list of invited groups and the original letter of notification are recorded below:</p>
<p>Convener Groups</p>
<p>The convener groups include the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Education Association, the Local Association, the Joint Association of University Faculty and Staff, the Joint Association of Secondary School Faculty and Staff, the Joint Association of Primary School Faculty and Staff, the Joint Association of Universities, the Joint Association of Secondary Schools, the Municipal Women's Association, the Municipal Defense Committee, the Municipal Fishermen's Association, the Lawyers' Association, the Accountants' Association, the Physicians' Association, the National Physicians' Association, the Journalists' Association, and other groups.</p>
<p>Original Text of Notification</p>
<p>The notification was issued yesterday, and the original text is recorded below: "Dear Sir, Upon investigation, the chief culprit of the Xi'an Incident, Zhang Xueliang, etc., committed heinous crimes. According to law, even capital punishment is not enough to cover their remaining guilt. The central government's extraordinary leniency only sentenced Zhang to ten years in prison and pardoned him on New Year's Day. Yang Hucheng and others were removed from their posts but retained their positions, which was originally out of a painful effort to protect national strength and love the local area. The goal was only to give the rebels a chance to reform and extricate themselves from their predicament under the principle of not violating discipline or deviating from reality. However, Zhang and Yang Hucheng, etc., refused to accept this and not only ignored the advice of the entire country but also increased their arrogance and actively engaged in reaction. It is clear that they are determined to resist orders and destroy the foundation of the country's resistance to foreign aggression and national salvation. Do Zhang and others think that because their crimes have been pardoned, they can be carefree and act arbitrarily? It must be known that violating military law can be pardoned, but their crimes of harming the country and ruining the people are countless. For example, in the September 18th Incident, they lost national territory by not resisting and led their troops into the pass, causing the four northeastern provinces to be handed over to the enemy, not only shameless but also bringing endless humiliation to the entire nation. This is the greatest of their crimes. Since the founding of the Republic of China, all internal wars, such as the Fengzhi, Zhizhi, Luqi, and Fengdui National Army battles, have exhausted the country's strength and put the people in dire straits. Which one was not directly or indirectly launched by Zhang and his son? In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the use of troops against Russia was started without authorization and then stopped without authorization, losing national rights and arousing the Japanese people's covetousness, which led to the main cause of the September 18th Incident. The pain is extreme. Moreover, when Zhang and others entered the pass, they always claimed to support the central government and Chairman Chiang, but in fact, during the war in the 19th year, Zhang and others provoked on both sides and also monitored the central government's representatives to Pan. The witnesses are all there. How can there be any support? The central government ordered them to lead their troops to Tianjin and Beijing. At first, they hesitated and watched the situation. When the victory or defeat was decided, they reorganized their troops to enter the pass and take over the Tianjin-Beijing territory. Is this what is called sincere support for the central government? During the Great Wall War of Resistance, Zhang and others watched and procrastinated without fighting hard and were also attached to Tianjin and Beijing as a military obstacle. If it were not for the central government and Chairman Chiang's tolerance and preservation, how could Zhang, who was condemned by the whole country, have safely come to Shanghai, safely gone abroad, and then returned to the country triumphantly? Zhang and others do not distinguish between gratitude and resentment. How can they have any conscience? In recent years, they have possessed an army but did not work hard to suppress the bandits and also deducted military pay in large quantities and privately transferred it to Northeastern University to recruit bad elements and create anti-central forces, causing officers and soldiers to lack supplies. They also slandered the central government with unfair treatment and deceived their subordinates. They clearly knew that the bandit suppression work could be completed in the last two weeks and that all forces could be unified to deal with foreign enemies, but they launched an unprecedented rebellion, causing eight years of hard work to be in vain. The lives of all the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed in the past and the strength of society have all been wasted. Is their flesh still edible? Moreover, Zhang and others' private lives are known for their extravagance in the universe. The huge amounts of money that have been rumored to be continuously remitted amount to millions at every turn. Where do these come from if not from the marrow of the northeast and the blood of the people? Recently, Zhang's troops and Yang Hucheng have developed close relations with the Red bandits, and the evidence is conclusive. Zhang and others' conspiracy to collude with the Red bandits has been completely exposed, and there is a danger of complete redization in the northwest. The central government will certainly not sit idly by and watch the people of the northwest being ravaged by the Red bandits and ignore the military force nurtured by the blood and sweat of the people of the northwest. Therefore, it will take decisive and swift measures to impose military sanctions on the rebels who collude with the bandits and resist orders. This is indeed the only way to protect the military and civilians in the northwest and preserve the foundation for national salvation and resistance to foreign aggression. It is not comparable to civil war, and the damage to national strength, the devastation of the local area, and the suffering of the people can all be imagined. Who is really responsible for this and who caused it? This cannot but be blamed on Zhang and others. Looking at the above-mentioned facts of Zhang's crimes of harming the country and ruining the people, it is clear at a glance. We should settle accounts with them from the standpoint of the people and must bring Zhang and others to justice before we stop. Therefore, we specially jointly initiated a call to convene people's groups in this city to hold a joint meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on the 21st of this month to discuss the settlement of Zhang Xueliang's crimes of harming the country and ruining the people. We have always admired your association's concern for national affairs, and we dare to send this letter to you, hoping that you will send four representatives to the meeting on time to jointly plan the progress. Yours sincerely,"</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Lack Raw Materials and Suspend Operations; Central Government Decides to Support Silkworm Seed Production</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province Handles Equipment and Working Capital Loans; Applications Accepted Immediately and Loans Issued by the Agricultural and Commercial Bank; Jiangsu Province Unifies Spring Seeds and Stipulates Transportation and Sales Methods</p>
<p>In order to develop the silkworm silk industry and save the lack of raw materials, the authorities in charge of improving the silkworm silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have decided to do their best to support the production and transportation and sales of silkworm seeds. The Zhejiang Silkworm Silk Unification Association has negotiated with the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to handle loans for silkworm seed production farm equipment and working capital. The Jiangsu Silkworm Industry Improvement Management Committee has stipulated unified transportation and sales methods for spring silkworm seeds. All have been implemented separately. A reporter from the New News Agency investigated and recorded the various situations as follows:</p>
<p>Zhejiang Silkworm Unification Association Rewards Seed Production</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Silkworm Silk Unification Committee believes that in recent years, there has been a shortage of domestic silkworm seeds. If this continues and no measures are taken to increase seed production, there will be a panic in the future, which will have a significant impact on the entire silkworm silk industry. Therefore, it has specifically negotiated with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Agricultural and Commercial Bank to support the improvement of silkworm seed farm equipment and handle working capital loans. After the Agricultural and Commercial Bank sent personnel to Zhejiang to investigate, the chairman of the Silkworm Silk Unification Association, Zeng Yangfu, and the deputy manager of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, Zou Bingwen, negotiated and formulated loan methods. The Silkworm Unification Association will start accepting applications and introducing loans from the Agricultural and Commercial Bank from now on.</p>
<p>Announcement on Handling Capital Loans</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Silkworm Silk Unification Committee's announcement on handling equipment and working capital loans for silkworm seed production farms in this province states that in order to support the silkworm seed production industry, this association has specially formulated the "Measures for Aiding Silkworm Seed Production Farms to Expand Equipment Loans in the 25th Year" and the "Measures for Working Capital Loans," which have been submitted to the provincial government for approval and implementation. All silkworm seed farms in this province, whether old or newly established, can apply to this association for introduction to the Agricultural and Commercial Bank for equipment loans for the construction, purchase of glory land, or expansion of equipment according to law. The established silkworm seed farms can also use their silkworm seeds as collateral and apply to this association for introduction to the Agricultural and Commercial Bank for working capital loans in order to expand the quantity of seed production. Applicants should come to the association to handle application procedures before February 9th. Separate printing measures and application forms are on file. This announcement.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Improvement Association Unifies Spring Seeds</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Silkworm Industry Improvement Management Committee stated that there was a shortage of spring silkworm seeds in the Suzhou and Wuxi areas last year, while there was a surplus in Zhenjiang, Danyang, and other places. Therefore, in accordance with the silkworm seed unification measures, it has decided on the following spring silkworm seed management and distribution measures for this year: ㊀ The total output of spring silkworm seeds for this year produced by various seed farms in this province will be increased by 8% compared with the actual sales volume in the spring season of Yun Year to supplement the number of Japanese seeds imported as spring silkworm seeds retained in the province. The remaining amount will be sold to Zhejiang Province first, and the remaining amount will be sold to other provinces and cities after approval. ㊁ In addition to the quantity stipulated for retention in the province and the quantity approved for export, the remaining or supplemented silkworm seeds of various seed farms shall not be sold freely. ㊂ The import quantity of various seed farms in other provinces and cities shall be limited to the actual sales volume of last year and shall be subject to approval. ㊃ The remaining amount of various seed farms shall be purchased by this association and distributed to the silkworm mulberry improvement areas in various counties for resale to silkworm farmers. A deposit of 20 cents will be paid for each sheet first. ㊄ In order to adjust the demand for silkworm seeds in this province and prevent middlemen from hoarding and speculating on prices, as well as smuggling to other provinces for false subsidy seed prices, distributors must first obtain a license. ㊅ The sales area for distributors in each area is limited. Those who cross the area will be fined five times the amount.</p>
<p>Silk Factories Shut Down Due to Lack of Raw Materials</p>
<p>Due to the reduction in the output of autumn cocoons last year, Shanghai factories were unable to purchase large quantities. Recently, due to the lack of raw materials and insufficient silk reeling, more than 20 factories have successively suspended operations. There are currently only 26 factories still in operation, but the raw materials are exhausted, and they will also suspend operations one after another in the coming days. According to the silk industry, the overseas silk market is still sluggish recently, and sales are stagnant. The highest price for Shanghai-produced warp is only over 700 yuan per load. Although the silk factories that are currently working hard want to purchase raw materials for silk reeling from abroad, the result will be more harm than good. Therefore, most silk factories are unwilling to operate due to excessive losses. The future of the silk industry is very pessimistic. As for the silk factories that have suspended operations, they will have to wait until this year's cocoon market to see what the cocoon price is like before they can prepare to start operations.</p>

<h3>German Nationals in Shanghai Depart for Japan in Groups to Enjoy the Snow</h3>
<p>Yokheinen, a well-known physical education teacher in Shanghai, has invited 21 German nationals in Shanghai to form a team to go to Japan to enjoy the snow scene, led by Yokheinen. The group departed yesterday on the Nagasaki Maru. It is reported that the group will land in Kobe and rest at the Shiga Kogen International Sightseeing Hotel before visiting various places.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Leaders Initiate Buddhist National Protection and Peace Association</h3>
<p>Buddhist leaders of this city, including Venerable Yuan Ying, Chang Xing, Miao Xing, Pin Jue, Hong Ming, Bao Jing, along with Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Zhao Puchu, Shen Binhan, Zhu Zigan, Gu Junyang, Qian Jingping, and others, deeply concerned about the escalating turmoil in the world and the human tendencies towards conquest, slaughter, death, and displacement, all of which are apparent, have initiated the Chinese Buddhist National Protection and Peace Association. This initiative aims to realize the spirit of Mahayana Buddhist salvation, to avert this seemingly inevitable fate, to unite Buddhists domestically, to promote the Buddhist teachings of compassion, joy, and equanimity, to practice the Bodhisattva's vows of altruism and relieving suffering, to maintain the vitality of the nation and people, and to ensure peace and tranquility for all humanity. Organizational efforts are already underway, and active progress is being made. The following is an exploration of the origins and purpose of the organization:</p>
<p>The chaos and upheaval in the world are intensifying daily, and people everywhere are filled with anxiety and a sense of impending doom. The realities of conquest and slaughter, the cries of death and displacement, assault our ears and eyes. Civilization faces the threat of destruction, and nations the peril of extinction. We Buddhists, living in this world and in China today, should consider how to realize the spirit of Mahayana salvation in order to reverse this seemingly inevitable fate and avert this seemingly insurmountable crisis. Thus, the movement for national protection and peace is what ought to be advocated. The Tathagata's teachings are for the protection of the nation. The Benevolent Kings Sutra and other scriptures have already proclaimed this principle. All beings must rely on the nation for survival, and thus must be saved through the nation. This is why Buddhas and Bodhisattvas sometimes manifest in national forms, showing that the nation must be protected. Furthermore, the Tathagata's teachings are teachings of peace. The precepts against killing, rooted in compassion, and the teachings of skillful means to liberate beings, have fully expressed this meaning. In this era of internecine conflict and pervasive killing intent, we Buddhists should especially arise with boundless compassion and great empathy, vowing to sacrifice our heads, eyes, brains, and marrow to alleviate the suffering of all beings. Therefore, the cause of peace must be pursued with unwavering dedication. We, the undersigned, feel the urgency of the burning house and the responsibility of our disciples, and thus initiate the organization of a National Protection and Peace Association to unite Buddhists nationwide, to promote the Buddhist teachings of compassion, joy, and equanimity, to carry forward the legacy of benevolence and peace of Sun Yat-sen, and to practice the Bodhisattva's vows of altruism and relieving suffering, in order to maintain the vitality of the nation and people and to ensure peace and tranquility for all humanity. We hope that all virtuous monks, elders, and lay practitioners across the country will be filled with compassion and vow to generate great resolve, universally encouraging participation, joyfully supporting this endeavor, together becoming a bulwark against the raging torrent and striving to be a ferry across the sea of suffering. We offer our sincere prayers and anticipation.</p>
<h3>Jingyun Building Robbery Investigation Not Yet Completed</h3>
<p>Rescheduled for Trial</p>
<p>The accounting office of Liu Jingdetang, located in room 505 of the Jingyun Building on Beijing Road, was invaded by bandits on December 31st of last year at 11:30 AM. The bandits stole over 5,000 yuan in national currency. As the robbers fled, they were pursued and attacked. As a result, Sikh Constable Lyet of the Western District Police Station and Pan Shulong, the gatekeeper of the Jingyun Building, were shot and killed by the bandits. Police apprehended one of the robbers, Wang Jinsheng, at the scene, and killed another robber, Wang Bingsheng. They also seized a pistol and a Mauser pistol, along with a portion of the stolen goods. Subsequently, Chinese and foreign detectives from the General Police Department apprehended over a dozen male and female bandits, who were handed over to the First Criminal Division of the Special First Court for detention pending further investigation. The aforementioned details have already been reported in the newspaper. It is now learned that when Judge Feng Shide convened the trial yesterday afternoon, the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, immediately stated that the investigation of the case was not yet complete and requested a postponement. Judge Feng approved the request and rescheduled the trial for the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3>Food Poisoning, One Dead</h3>
<p>Corpse Examined Yesterday</p>
<p>On the 14th of this month, twelve colleagues at the Datong Melon Seed Factory on Manufacturing Bureau Road in the Nanshi district shared a lunch. Half an hour later, they all experienced vomiting, numbness in their limbs, and fell unconscious. The factory immediately sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment. The local police station was notified and dispatched officers to investigate. They took the remaining food for analysis to determine the cause. Unfortunately, one of the victims, Zhu Fuqing, age 21, from Ningbo, died at 4:00 PM on the 16th due to lack of effective treatment. The hospital reported the death to the Laozha Police Station, which ordered detectives to take the body to the Philand Road mortuary. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang Zongru from the First Special District Court, along with medical examiners Wei and Zhang, court clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, arrived at the mortuary to examine the body. According to the detectives' report, the case occurred in the Chinese district and is currently under investigation by the local police station. Mr. Zhang concluded that the deceased, Zhu Fuqing, male, died from food poisoning before death. The body was released to his father, Zhu Kunyuan, who signed a statement.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteers in 1936</h3>
<p>㊀ General Overview: In March and April of last year, the Commander of the British Forces in Shanghai inspected several units of the Volunteers, examining their mobilization readiness, supply depots, and management methods. The annual drills of the unit were held on schedule, with 1,588 officers and members participating, breaking previous records. The annual rifle competition held on weekends lasted for four weeks due to the large number of individual and team participants. Drill exercises were held between February and April. From June to July, most units' officers and non-commissioned officers practiced reconnaissance in various parts of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The entire unit's members were well-dressed and equipped, which was commendable. As of the end of last year, the unit had 1,943 members, excluding quartermasters, instructors, medical officers, and reserve officers.</p>
<p>㊁ Renovation of Armored Vehicles: Since 1934, the Volunteers had two armored vehicles, but they were too large and impractical. The unit commander decided to spend a small amount of money to slightly modify them so that they could continue to be used without replacement. After the renovation, the unit handed them over to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department for use by its riot squad. As for replacing a layer, the Council was implementing austerity measures and had to postpone the plan.</p>
<p>㊂ Inspection of the British and American Troops: Last year, a representative from the British Forces in Hong Kong came to Shanghai to inspect the supplies and equipment of the unit's British troops. The Commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment in Shanghai inspected the weapons and equipment of the unit's American troops. All firearms were inspected, and all useless supplies were removed.</p>
<p>㊃ First Term Training This Year: The first term training this year was held between October and December of last year. Strategy training courses, firearms training courses, and field tactics training courses were held as scheduled. Mr. Fan, the Deputy Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, attended twice to lecture on the knowledge of riot suppression. The unit drew a map for use when it was necessary to send troops to the border line of the concession for guard duty. The locations of the units were marked on the map. The next term of training will continue this year, and the organization will be further expanded. Many American officers will serve as instructors. In addition, from November to December of last year, a separate class was opened for platoon leaders, quartermasters, and sergeants to impart knowledge of their duties in peacetime and during mobilization.</p>
<p>㊄ Weekend Camping: The unit practiced camping every weekend. During this period, in addition to training in shooting and indoor lectures, most units practiced patrol and guard duties.</p>
<p>㊅ Russian Unit: The members of the Russian unit were in good health and had received sufficient training. They are learning English and can closely cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department in the event of an accident, and can be fully mobilized at any time. Last year, sixteen members were transferred to the Police Department for service and achieved good results. Another officer and forty-three members of the unit served as guards at the Ward Road Jail.</p>
<p>㊈ Disbanding of the Artillery Unit: Since November of last year, all members of the unit's light artillery unit have been reorganized into machine gun units. Half of the members of the heavy artillery unit were transferred to other units, and the rest were dismissed.</p>
<h3>Two Cases of Adultery</h3>
<p>One Sentenced, One Under Investigation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court accepted two adultery cases transferred by the Yulin Road and Huishan police stations. One was a husband accusing his wife of adultery, and the other was a wife accusing her husband of adultery. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Husband Accuses Wife</p>
<p>Yan Long from Tongzhou, 33 years old, works at the Shenchang Glass Factory in the Pingmin Village on Qimusi Road. He married Yu Xiuzhen from Haimen six years ago and lived with her at No. 32 Yanshan Lane, Yanshan Road. Yu also works at the Shenxin No. 6 Cotton Mill. Yan only returns home once or twice a month due to his work. Wu Boxian, a 29-year-old from Suzhou, has been living with them and works at the Zhonghua No. 1 Knitting Factory. He is not yet married. In April of last year, Yu became ill and lacked care. Wu took the opportunity to serve her medicine and accompanied her all day, thus gaining her favor and engaging in illicit relations. Yan was unaware of this. Recently, Wu has become more brazen and terminated his own lease and moved in with her, essentially taking over Yan's home. Recently, when Yan Long returned home, Wu actually acted as the host and evicted Yan. Yan was unwilling to accept this and reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station at around 4:00 PM yesterday. Detective Ma Anxiang went to the scene and apprehended the adulterous couple. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu charged them with adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Code. After questioning by Judge Ye Shengchao, Yu Xiuzhen and Wu Boxian were each sentenced to two months in prison as a warning.</p>
<p>Wife Accuses Husband</p>
<p>Lin Fuqing, a 29-year-old coppersmith from Ningbo, was engaged in 1928 to Miss Cai, the 18-year-old daughter of Cai Zifang, a fellow villager living at No. 35 Wufu Lane, Tangshan Road. Because she was young, the marriage was postponed until March 1st of last year. However, after the engagement, Lin became involved with Shen Jiqing, a 32-year-old woman from Ningbo, and lived with her at No. 350, Wuhou Lane, Zhoushan Road. As a result, Lin treated Cai poorly after their marriage. Whenever Cai asked Lin for household expenses, she was beaten. He also did not return home often. Cai began to pay attention to Lin's whereabouts and recently learned of his secret. She reported it to the Huishan Police Station at around 12:00 AM last night. Detective Gu Zhongshu went to the scene and arrested Lin and Shen. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shuaizhu also charged them with adultery. However, Lin Fuqing argued that Cai had long known about his affair with Shen and that the two women often met. Lin Cai denied this. Judge Ye considered that this point should be investigated and ordered that the case be rescheduled for further questioning of the witnesses.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Dispatches Officers to Strictly Arrest Opium Offenders</h3>
<p>Citizens Who Have Quit Opium Will Be Randomly Inspected and Tested; Licensed Smokers Will Also Have Their Opium Consumption Gradually Reduced</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly eradicate opium addiction, the Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has recently appointed special officers to strictly arrest opium offenders who have evaded the law. Random inspections and gradual reductions in opium consumption will be implemented for citizens who have already quit opium and for licensed smokers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Orders to Strictly Arrest</p>
<p>The central government stipulated a two-year deadline for drug prohibition, from 1935 to the end of last year, which has now expired. From January 1st of this year, all those caught manufacturing, transporting, selling, and injecting morphine, etc., will be sentenced to death according to law. The Fourth Division of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau began registering opium addicts last year, with a total of over 40,000 people. Among them, over 18,000 have voluntarily quit, and over 32,000 have renewed their licenses. However, as Shanghai is a major industrial and commercial city and has treaty port relations, there must be many who intend to evade the law. In order to thoroughly eradicate opium addiction, the Municipal Police Bureau has appointed special officers to work with the district and branch bureaus to strictly investigate and arrest offenders. The police have also negotiated with the French Concession Police to assist in the effort. It is estimated that over 110 opium offenders have been arrested this month, all of whom have been transferred to the Third Division for interrogation and then to the Garrison Headquarters for trial. It is reported that the Garrison Headquarters, in order to strictly enforce the law, will impose the death penalty on all drug offenders. This has been reported to the Military Affairs Commission for approval and will be implemented as soon as it is approved.</p>
<p>Gradual Reduction and Random Inspection</p>
<p>After the opium addict registration deadline, it is necessary to conduct random inspections and tests to determine whether those who have quit opium have resumed smoking and whether those who have not quit have reduced their opium consumption, in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Opium Prohibition Commissioner. According to Director Ye of the Opium Prohibition Section of the Police Bureau yesterday, the two issues of gradual reduction of opium consumption and random inspection of those who have quit are important, and the work will not be successful without detailed measures. The section has drafted regulations and submitted them to the Commissioner, who will then submit them to the Municipal Government for approval. As soon as they are approved, they will be implemented separately in order to thoroughly eradicate opium addiction.</p>
<h3>Indian Man Who Survived Hanging Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>To Be Sent to India to Serve Hard Labor</p>
<p>Indian man Atma Singh was sentenced to death for murder. During the hanging at Ward Road Jail on December 29th of last year, the rope suddenly broke, and Singh fell to the ground and did not die. The British Consul General in Shanghai, Sir Herbert Phillips, investigated and determined that the steel beam of the gallows was too sharp, causing the rope to break. The executioner was not at fault. After reporting to the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, it is learned that the Ambassador has reduced the sentence to life imprisonment with hard labor. Singh will be sent to India for imprisonment.</p>
<h3>White Russian Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Celebrates 10th Anniversary</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the 10th anniversary of the founding of the White Russian Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. White Russian community groups in Shanghai, in recognition of the detachment's diligent service and excellent past performance, sent many representatives to congratulate them.</p>
<h3>Shoal Discovered at Jiaoshan, Hindering Navigation on the Shanghai-Hankou Route</h3>
<p>Rapid Siltation in the Daijia Island Channel; River Water Has Slightly Risen Recently</p>
<p>According to reports received by the Customs House yesterday morning, the water level in the Shanghai-Hankou section of the Yangtze River has risen slightly. However, there are many silted and shallow areas along the route, making navigation difficult. The following is a record of the various situations:</p>
<p>Slight Rise in Draft for Shanghai-Hankou</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai-Hankou water level report received by the Customs House yesterday morning, the minimum draft limit is ten feet three inches. The minimum draft limit on the 15th was only eight feet nine inches, so the river water has risen by more than one foot, easing navigation difficulties slightly. However, major river steamers and shipping companies are temporarily suspending services to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Shoal Discovered East of Jiaoshan</p>
<p>Due to the low water level of the river, obstacles have emerged on the Shanghai-Hankou waterway. The Customs House has received reports of a shoal east of Jiaoshan waterway in the Zhenjiang section. However, whether this is accurate is still pending a report from the Customs survey vessel dispatched for measurement, after which instructions for navigation will be issued to guide Shanghai-Hankou shipping vessels.</p>
<p>Survey Vessel Stationed at Madang Port</p>
<p>At the same time, the Madang waterway in the Jiujiang section is the most dangerous port in this period of shallow water. Therefore, the Customs House has specially dispatched a survey vessel, manned by a river affairs officer, to be stationed there and to survey the surrounding waterways at any time, so that shipping vessels can consult them nearby to maintain navigation safety and protect the waterway.</p>
<p>Daijia Island Channel Silted</p>
<p>The Chief River Affairs Officer of the Maritime Customs House also issued a notice regarding the siltation of the waterway east of Daijia Island in the Hankou section, stating that the river affairs section of the Jianghai Customs House telegraphed on the 15th of this month (whether it is accurate needs to be confirmed) as follows: "The waterway east of Daijia Island is silting up rapidly. The shallowest water depth in the waterway east of Daijia Island was 2.89 meters (9.5 feet) on the 15th of this month, while the Hankou water gauge reading was zero degrees."</p>
<h3>Japanese Literary Giant Shimazaki Toson Passes Through Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Shimazaki Toson, a veteran of the Japanese literary scene who represented Japan at the World PEN Congress in the Brazilian capital last June, is returning to Japan from Europe aboard the Junyo Maru. It is learned that Mr. Shimazaki will pass through Shanghai tomorrow afternoon and plans to stay in Shanghai for a while before returning home.

After returning home, he has written many works, the most famous of which are "Spring," "New Life," "Home," "When Cherries Ripen," "Breaking the Commandment," and "The Life of a Certain Woman." Recently, he completed the book "Dawn," which describes the historical facts of the Meiji Restoration and has caused a sensation in the Japanese literary world. It is reported that the Japanese literary community in Shanghai has been preparing to welcome Mr. Shimazaki since learning of his visit.</p>
<h3>Anti-Tuberculosis Association Launches Anti-Tuberculosis Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Actively Seeking Submissions</p>
<p>The Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association is launching an anti-tuberculosis Chinese painting exhibition to promote the anti-tuberculosis movement among citizens, in the hope that citizens will have a deeper understanding of the anti-tuberculosis movement. The Association has now begun seeking submissions, and will schedule a public exhibition once all submissions have been received.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade Report for Last Month</h3>
<p>In December of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade received a total of 68 alarms, including 5 false alarms. The total value of property lost due to fire was 42,090 yuan in national currency within the Shanghai Municipal Council and 3,876 yuan in national currency in the road extension area outside the boundary. The total value of property endangered by fire was 4,343,755 yuan in national currency within the Shanghai Municipal Council and 285,800 yuan in national currency in the road extension area outside the boundary. In the same month, the Brigade received a total of 429 requests for medical assistance, and a total of 428 patients were sent to various hospitals.</p>
<h3>Climate Gradually Improving, Sharp Decrease in Citizen Deaths</h3>
<p>Fifty-One Deaths from Illness Last Week</p>
<p>The Huaye News Agency reports that as winter approaches, the climate is gradually improving, and the number of citizens dying from illness has been decreasing recently. According to the joint statistics on infectious disease deaths for the past week, jointly released by the Harbor Quarantine Office, the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, and the French Concession Health Department, there were 9 deaths from smallpox, 3 from scarlet fever, 2 from dysentery, 2 from meningitis and cerebrospinal meningitis, 3 from diphtheria, 16 from typhoid and paratyphoid, 4 from measles, 3 from beriberi, 1 from influenza, 6 from pulmonary tuberculosis, and 2 from pneumonia, for a total of 51 deaths, a decrease of 15% compared to the previous week. It is also reported that influenza is currently most prevalent in the Japanese residential area.</p>
<h3>Import of Foreign Rice Will Definitely Decrease This Year</h3>
<p>The Food Transport and Sales Bureau Humbly Plans to Facilitate the Transportation and Sale of Domestic Rice</p>
<p>Due to the bumper grain harvests in various regions last year, rice prices have not shown a downward trend, benefiting the rural economy significantly. Due to the increase in foreign rice tariffs last year, foreign rice imports decreased significantly compared to the previous year. It is expected that foreign rice imports will decrease even further this year. Recently, there has been a lot of rice transported from Shanghai to Guangdong and North China. Guangdong is still experiencing a rice shortage, and the government is providing various conveniences in transportation to ensure that rice is supplied steadily from the rice-producing areas, preventing panic. The government has now established the Food Transport and Sales Bureau, and all work needs to be planned from the beginning. However, considering the domestic grain supply and demand situation in various regions this year, if transportation and sales are carried out properly, it will not only benefit the rural economy significantly, but also improve the overall food supply. It is learned that the Food Transport and Sales Bureau is currently drafting a detailed plan, which will be submitted to the central government for approval before it can be implemented step by step. As for the rumor that the central government will establish a separate Food Administration Bureau, all parties have denied it.</p>
<h3>1936 Bank Surplus Amounts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers' Association recently compiled and published the annual surplus amounts of various banks in Shanghai for 1936, including 24 banks such as the Bank of Communications. Yesterday, the Association published the surplus amounts of eight banks, including the China &amp; South Sea Bank: China, 800,000 yuan; Juxingcheng, 365,000 yuan; Jiangsu Farmers, 232,100 yuan; Sichuan-Kang, 165,800 yuan; Zhuhai, 83,000 yuan; China Agricultural &amp; Commercial, 82,600 yuan; Yongxiang, 56,800 yuan; Hengli, 54,000 yuan. The reports from more than ten other banks, including the Bank of China, will be published successively.</p>
<p>In addition, the 1936 surplus of the Central Bank is estimated to be over 14 million yuan, not including the surpluses of its branches and sub-branches in various regions, which is an increase compared to the previous two years.</p>
<h3>Woman Confesses to Husband and Commits Suicide with Scissors</h3>
<p>Tailor Pretends to Be Drunk and Attempts Indecent Assault; Perpetrator Arrested and Charged by Police After Incident</p>
<p>Shen Yunshan, a 24-year-old man from Ningbo, runs the Yuanchang Hongbang Tailoring Shop at No. 410 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. His wife, Mrs. Hu, is 20 years old and from the same hometown, and also lives in the shop. At 8:30 PM on the 13th of this month, Shen went out on business. A tailor employed in the shop, Jin Jichen, 32 years old, from Songjiang, pretended to be drunk and broke into Shen's room, sleeping on Shen's wife Hu's bed, intending to indecently assault and rape her. After she shouted at him, another employee, Tong Rensheng, and two apprentices pulled Jin out of the room. That night, when Shen returned to the shop, Mrs. Hu and the other employees and apprentices kept the matter secret. On the afternoon of the 15th, at 2:30 PM, Shen Yunshan learned of the incident and questioned his wife. Mrs. Hu felt ashamed and unable to face people. In a moment of desperation, she took a pair of scissors and stabbed her throat in an attempt to show her innocence to her husband. Shen and the other employees immediately snatched the scissors from her hand, but she had already suffered a severe injury and was bleeding profusely. Shen prepared a vehicle and sent her to the Shanghai Hospital in Nanshi for treatment. He also reported the incident to the French Police, who sent detectives to arrest Jin. Yesterday, he was transferred to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Judge Sun Penghao interrogated him. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the case, briefly saying that the investigation into the case of attempted rape and abetment to suicide had not yet concluded and requested a postponement for further investigation before filing a charge. The court acknowledged the report, stating that the case was related to public morals and prohibited spectators. After questioning the defendant and witnesses, the court ordered a postponement until the 25th for further questioning and ordered a forensic doctor to go to the hospital to examine the injuries.</p>

<h3>Continued Report on the Case of Miss Xue Xiang</h3>
<p>Ambiguous Behaviors Known to All Servants; Whether Miss Xiang Had Children Remains Under Investigation</p>
<p>Following the marriage of Xue Xiang, daughter of the deceased paint tycoon Xue Baorun, to real estate merchant Xu Liangchen, and their subsequent cohabitation at No. 2, Lane 106, Maithurst Road, an 18-year-old youth from Suzhou named Wang Genbao (residing at No. 11, Renyuan Lane, Bair Road), represented by his father Wang Yongquan as his legal guardian, filed a lawsuit at the Special First District Court's Civil Division against Mr. and Mrs. Xu, seeking confirmation of paternity. The suit arises from Wang Yongquan's prior employment at Xue Baorun's residence</p>
<p>as a chauffeur</p>
<p>during which time he had an affair with Xue Xiang, resulting in a secret pregnancy. To avoid scrutiny, they rented a house at No. 292, Taian Lane, Beishansi Road, as a temporary place for childbirth. On February 12th of the Republic of China's eighth year, a son named Genbao was born. The significance of this name lies in its implication that the child's foundation is rooted in his maternal grandfather, Baorun. Subsequently, after Xue Xiang married Xu Liangchen, it became difficult to meet her due to her residing in a seemingly inaccessible grand residence. Despite sending letters to the Xues, requesting recognition,</p>
<p>they were ignored.</p>
<p>Hence, the lawsuit was initiated. This case has already undergone preliminary interrogations by the Special Court, as reported in this newspaper yesterday morning. The judge, Xu, presided over a continued hearing at the Civil Court No. 7. The defendant, Xue Xiang, did not appear. Lawyers E. Sen and Tang Shenpei were present. Plaintiff's lawyer Chen Wen stated that they were ordered by the court to investigate and summon witnesses, but the landlord of No. 292 Beishansi Road is currently out of Shanghai and back in his hometown. They have not been able to locate the midwife. Plaintiff Wang Yongquan testified that he was a chauffeur at the Xue residence from March of the Republic of China's sixth year until he resigned in May of the following year. Four to five days after I arrived at the Xue residence, I</p>
<p>began a relationship</p>
<p>with Xue Xiang. Soon after, Miss Xue became pregnant. To avoid attracting attention, they rented a house upstairs at No. 292, Taian Lane, Beishansi Road. The landlord was surnamed Xu, and the monthly rent was eight yuan. On February 12th of the Republic's eighth year, a son, Genbao, was born. Three or four days after the delivery, Xue Xiang took a car home. I continued to live there for about three years, secretly visiting her from time to time. Every night, I would go to the Xue residence. Because there was only a very short wall outside the door, I had to</p>
<p>climb over the wall</p>
<p>directly into Miss Xue's boudoir. Later, the Xue family built a new house in the back, and Xiang's bedroom was also moved. I could not go there anymore. Miss Xue once sent me a letter, explaining the way to enter the room. Until September 12th of a certain year, Miss Xue was to be married at Yipinxiang. Beforehand, I telephoned her, agreeing to talk at the furniture department of Wing On Company. Miss Xue cried to me, saying that she had to get married now, and</p>
<p>gave me five hundred gold pieces.</p>
<p>From then on, we did not see each other again. But this kind of ambiguous behavior was known to the old servants, grooms, gardeners, etc. of the Xue family. Plaintiff's lawyer Chen Wen then requested that the defendant be ordered to appear in court in person, stating that the case has been delayed for a long time, making it difficult to investigate evidence and witnesses. However, facial features, blood types, etc., can all be identified. Moreover, according to the plaintiff's knowledge, Xue Xiang was also pregnant before producing Genbao, and it</p>
<p>was twins</p>
<p>that the plaintiff personally used herbal medicine to terminate. Defense lawyers E. Sen and Tang Shenpei stood up and denied all the facts alleged by the plaintiff, saying that the defendant was very willing to appear in court in person, but because the plaintiff's allegations were not only devoid of evidence, but also completely fictitious. The defense can</p>
<p>solemnly declare</p>
<p>that Miss Xue has never given birth. If the plaintiff can provide evidence, the defendant will also present conclusive counter-evidence. It is obvious that the purpose of forcing the person to appear in court for questioning in such a worthless lawsuit is clear. Judge Xu ordered the case to be adjourned to the morning of the 25th for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Grain Transport and Sales Bureau Investigates Rice Production in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Consulting with Rice Merchants at Any Time; Planning the Traditional Regulation of People's Food Supply</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Grain Transport and Sales Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, it has been paying close attention to the transport and sales situation of rice and grain in various provinces. In addition to consulting rice merchants for general opinions at any time, it has also been investigating the actual rice production conditions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei and other provinces in separate groups, so that it can discuss with the Ministry of Finance and propose a plan to regulate the people's food supply in a coordinated manner. Regarding cooperation with rice merchants, because the bureau is an administrative body responsible for managing transport and sales, it does not have a specific organization that invites the rice industry to participate (such as a council). External rumors may be a misunderstanding of cooperation.</p>
<h3>National Goods Competition Halted as Lunar New Year Approaches</h3>
<p>Most Factories Have No Time to Participate; Difficult to Realize in the Near Future</p>
<p>The United Competition Conference of National Goods Factories, initiated by the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, has already designated the former site of Yunfei Automobile Company at No. 126 Jing'an Temple Road as the venue. More than 80 booths have been set up inside the venue, divided into special, A, B, and C grades, which factories can freely choose. It has been more than a month since preparations began, but the number of participating manufacturers is still small, which has caused the opening date to be postponed repeatedly. According to the reporter's inquiries, the factories are all busy with preparing for the settlement procedures because the Lunar New Year is approaching soon, and they have no time to participate in this competition. Therefore, the association's affairs have been virtually suspended, and it is unlikely to be realized in the near future.</p>
<h3>Fire on Bair Road This Morning, Five People Buried in Flames</h3>
<p>Fire Started in the Home of Tenant Chen Zhougui; Entire Family of Six Died Together</p>
<p>—Shen Shoushan Also Died Shortly After—</p>
<p>A city-owned house at No. 119, next to Xinping Lane at the intersection of Pingjili Road, Bair Road in the French Concession, together with the overpass building of Xinping Lane, was rented by Shen Shoushan, a 56-year-old from Anhui Province, who acted as the second landlord. He lived with his concubine, an old woman named Bi Lan, from Yangzhou (55 years old), and her son Bi Changsan (35 years old), daughter-in-law Bi Liu (31 years old), grandson Bi Abao (10 years old), adopted granddaughter-in-law Bi Zuanyu (12 years old), and granddaughter Bi Yindi (3 years old), a family of seven, in a three-story attic. The storefront was rented out to someone to open a Zhongxing retail cloth shop. The front and back building's pavilion rooms and overpass were all rented out to people. At about 3 o'clock this morning, a fire suddenly broke out accidentally in the room of Chen Zhougui, a tenant in the back building who was a 毛毛匠 (a craftsman specializing in street sewer work) from Nanjing. By the time Bi Changsan and his late father Shen Shoushan noticed it, the fire had spread to the attic. They immediately climbed through the tiger window to the roof and jumped off the sun deck. Bi was injured due to his old age. Shen's concubine, i.e. Bi Changsan's mother, wife, daughter-in-law, granddaughter-in-law, and granddaughter Bi Lan, Bi Liu, Bi Abao, Bi Zuanyu, and Bi Yindi, five elderly and young people, were all killed in the fire because they were unable to escape. When the fire broke out, the tenants living in the front and back buildings and the pavilion rooms all jumped out of the windows because the stairs were blocked by the fire. Upon receiving the news, the Fire Brigade immediately drove the fire engines to the scene to put out the fire. It took an hour to extinguish it, also affecting the floor space of the Fuchang Grain Shop to the left, destroying a total of three rooms. After the fire was extinguished, the injured Shen Shoushan was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by the Fire Brigade, but he died in the hospital due to his serious injuries. The five corpses, large and small, were pulled out and sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall autopsy site. The corpses were all burned beyond recognition, with incomplete limbs, a tragic sight to behold. At noon, the police station reported to the Special Second Court, and Prosecutor Wang Ren arrived at the scene to verify that the five corpses, large and small, had been burned to death and handed them over to Bi Changsan to claim the bodies.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Xu Xueseng Case</h3>
<p>Xu Xueseng, the former Director of the Gansu Opium Prohibition Bureau, was severely injured in the face and head by a thug named Gao Jinsheng, who doused him with wine and nitric acid on Wangzhi Road in the French Concession in March of the 25th year. Gao Jinsheng was arrested on the spot and sentenced to four years by the Second Special Court. Xu Xueseng then filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai Local Court against his sworn brothers Zhu Guanghan and Chen Axi for instigating the injury. After repeated investigations by the Local Court, Xu Xueseng has now filed a motion to withdraw the lawsuit. However, during the trial of this case, Xu Xueseng suddenly found a witness, Fang Aliu, who said that his brother and Gao Jinsheng were in the same cell in the Second Special Court detention center. Zhu Guanghan's defense lawyer, Gu Changyuan, even went to the detention center on behalf of Zhu Guanghan to meet with Gao Jinsheng, instructing him not to confess anything, and Gao Jinsheng entrusted him to take out three letters to his aunt, explaining the matter, etc. Xu Xueseng used this to accuse Gu Changyuan to the prosecutor of destroying evidence. During the investigation, Gu Changyuan stated that Gao Jinsheng's defense lawyer was Zou Shengzu, but because Zou had to go to Jiangsu for something, he acted as the alternate defense lawyer. Therefore, he should have met and inquired about the case, and there was no instigation to confess. Moreover, Zhu Guanghan's case occurred later, and he had not yet been entrusted by Zhu at that time. The prosecutor should summon Lawyer Zou to the court to prove the matter, and Gao Jinsheng also denied the matter when questioned in the criminal court. While this case was being investigated and studied, the witness Fang Aliu suddenly surrendered himself to the prosecutor, claiming that the previous testimony attacking Gu Changyuan was all Xu Xueseng Shen Tong's private lawsuit to extort Zhu, so he fabricated this fake letter as proof. The prosecutor was highly suspicious of Fang Aliu's inconsistent statements, so he jointly prosecuted Fang Aliu for perjury and Gu Changyuan for destroying evidence. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Lu Hongyi opened the trial. Xu Xueseng did not appear. Gu Changyuan argued that Xu Xueseng saw that he was vigorously defending Zhu Guanghan and exposing his scheme of fraud, and held a grudge against him, so he falsely accused him. Moreover, Gao Jinsheng had also gone to the court to verify that the handwriting on the letter did not match, and claimed that he had never written the letter and had no aunt at all. In short, Xu's false accusation was intended to prevent me from defending Zhu and attacking his misconduct. Fortunately, Xu has already realized that he is at fault in the Zhu Guanghan injury case and is afraid of being harmed himself, so he requested to withdraw the lawsuit, and even fled for fear of punishment. Please investigate clearly, etc. Fang Aliu confessed that he and Xu Xueseng were friends, and because he was enthusiastic for a moment, he listened to help. Later, he heard that the perjury was found out and would be severely punished, so he surrendered himself to the case and asked for leniency, etc. Witness Xu Shunjun also testified that Xu Xueseng and Fang Aliu were introduced to him by friends Xu Yousan and Zhu, etc. Because Gao Jinsheng poured nitric acid wine on Xu Xueseng, the case involved sworn brother Zhu Guanghan, and it is now being tried in your court. Xu Xueseng asked me for help, and I didn't want to, but I saw that the letter carried by Fang Aliu was issued from the Second Special Court detention center. I don't know who wrote the letter, etc. The official instructed on how the case is related, and adjourned the hearing to summon Xu Yousan et al. for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Pays Attention to Public Health Undertakings</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau is sparing no effort in promoting public health undertakings. Director Li Ting'an and Chief Zhou are enthusiastically planning various matters, which have been gradually realized. The following is the recent progress announced by the bureau:</p>
<p>Municipal Hospital Now Open</p>
<p>The newly built Municipal Hospital in the city center is one of the few medical institutions in the city. Construction took two years to complete, and the internal equipment has been arranged. Future expansions are planned. For the convenience of patients, it opened on January 4th. Those seeking medical treatment are very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Hygiene Experiment Institute Moves to New Building</p>
<p>The Hygiene Experiment Institute is also one of the bureau's important constructions. Since the foundation was laid on New Year's Day in the 24th year of the Republic of China, the entire building has been completed. Starting on New Year's Day this year, it gradually moved from its old site on Guangdong Street, Qiujiang Road, to the city center. Now it has all been moved and started working, further facilitating the citizens. In addition, a branch office has been set up in Xiude New Village, Chengdu Road, to handle various inspection and inspection matters and sell blood serums and vaccines.</p>
<p>Hubbei Health Center is Now Open</p>
<p>The Hubbei Health Office was completed last winter and also started working on New Year's Day. In addition to all administrative affairs, there are also diagnosis and treatment, cleaning, maternal and child health, infectious diseases, prevention, and other work. All poor citizens who go for medical treatment are given free treatment. The center also plans to set up a public bathhouse to benefit the public.</p>
<p>Luxing Clinic Completed</p>
<p>The Health Bureau has also established a clinic in Luxing. The land and construction costs of the clinic are about 2,000 yuan, all of which were raised by Zhang Qiwen and other members of the local administrative committee. Director Li considered it a matter of public health and, in addition to submitting this plan to the municipal government for approval, he twice personally went to inspect it. Now the construction project and internal equipment are ready, and work will begin within days.</p>
<h3>Poor People Crowding the Temporary Shelter in South Shanghai</h3>
<p>Total Number Reaches More Than 2,800; Difficult to Expect Donations From All Circles</p>
<p>The temporary shelter in South Shanghai, sponsored by the Shanghai Charity Federation, has been sheltering civilians in the Chaozhou Guild Hall in the South Station since its establishment on December 15th of last year, reaching more than 2,800 people. In recent days, the weather has been severely cold, and the number of poor people who are hungry and cold and throwing themselves into the shelter is increasing, which is very miserable. The members of the association, Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Gu Xinyi, etc., are working tirelessly to raise funds because the shelter's funds are insufficient and rely entirely on fundraising, and the relief efforts cannot be delayed. Successive donors include Zhabei Water and Electricity Company 500 yuan, Renji Shantang first time 400 yuan, Gu Xinyi raised from Grain Exchange and Grain and Oilcake Industry Association 100 yuan each, Pengshoutang Pengshou noodles 500 packs, Chunfeng pawnshop 6 quilts, 18 cotton clothes, Chunhe pawnshop 24 cotton clothes, Wu Wenqing 25 old underwear, Layman Songshan 10 stones of white rice, Lu Wenzhong Baoan water 500 bottles, Xinwei Relief Association 400 bottles of sha medicine water, all are very enthusiastic. However, it is still hoped that all sectors will donate generously, whether it is clothing or rice. If there is a substantial amount, it can be sent to the association at Renji Changnei, 6 Ma Road.</p>
<h3>Employees of the Gold Industry Exchange Petitioned Du and Others Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting an Increase in the Amount of Retirement Pay</p>
<p>The board of directors of the Shanghai Gold Industry Exchange decided to reduce staff in order to save expenses. The laid-off employees were to be given six months' severance pay. All 130 employees (107 staff and 23 workers) were panicked. At 5 pm yesterday, they sent four representatives, together with the directors of the general affairs accounting, business, and calculation departments, to the board of directors to petition for an increase in the number of months of severance pay. They traveled by car, first to Tongfengyong Gold Shop on Nanjing Road to visit Executive Director Xu Busun. Unfortunately, Xu was out. They then went to Huagenei Road to visit Chairman Du Yuesheng and Executive Director Zhang Xiaolin. Representatives stated their opinions, requesting justice, and submitted a petition. It is reported that all employees of the institute requested an increase in the number of severance payments to three years per person, calculated according to salary proportions. The reason is that the institute has been in operation for 16 years. Except for a normal year in the 24th year and a loss of more than 100,000 yuan in the 25th year, the accumulated surplus over the years has been very large, reaching more than 2 million yuan. The request for three years of severance pay is not excessive. Moreover, when the previous Goods Exchange was dismissed, each person was issued one year of severance pay.</p>
<h3>Soldiers Carrying Counterfeit Money</h3>
<p>Wei, the captain of the Municipal Police Water Patrol Team, dispatched police officers Wang Fucheng and Huang Yutang to inspect pedestrians in the Pubin area of ​​South City at about 5 pm the day before yesterday. When they patrolled to Pier 6, they saw an armed soldier on the Xirenhe passenger ship. When they caught sight of the police team arriving, they looked shocked. Suspecting that the soldier was suspicious, they stopped him and arrested him on the spot, and conducted a physical examination. As a result, they found ten counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of China, each worth five yuan, totaling fifty yuan, and a special agent symbol of the Tax Police Regiment. They immediately took him to the team for questioning. He claimed to be Zeng Xiong, 25 years old, from Hefei. He faltered when it came to the origin of the counterfeit money. As the case involved carrying counterfeit money, he was ordered to prepare a document to be sent to the bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Wan and Lu Accountants Handle Income Tax</h3>
<p>Shanghai's famous accountants and lawyers Wan Weijian and Lu Jingmin believe that the calculation and declaration procedures of income tax are very complicated, and are difficult for ordinary business circles to understand. Moreover, the Chinese business community uses old-fashioned accounting methods. Not only are the names of the thin books different, but also for issues such as inventory valuation, asset depreciation, and bad debt handling related to net profit, they are often overlooked. Accurate net profit is difficult without accurate and proper calculations. Therefore, Wan and Lu have jointly established an income tax agency to specialize in handling all income tax matters for the business community and freelancers. In recent days, there have been dozens of cases of entrustment and consultation from various circles. It is reported that a brochure has been printed for all sectors to request for review. The agency is located at Room 213, 2nd Floor, Jinxing Building, Henan Road.</p>
<h3>Branch of the Chinese Medical Science Society Established in the United States</h3>
<p>The Chinese Medical Science Research Society is about to publish the eighth issue of the Scientific Medical Journal. The president of the society and the chief editors Xie Liheng, Fang Gongpu, Gong Xingzhai, Xu Kai, and Sheng Biru are sparing no effort in promoting the affairs of the society. Therefore, the number of members and readers is increasing, and there are many branches established in various places. Recently, the American branch Chen Yansheng, Lin Dasheng, the domestic Guangdong branch Xue Yuwei, and the Jiangsu Yangku branch Tang Difen have all been established. According to Director Xu Kai, more branches will be established in the future, and all efforts will be made to work with colleagues at home and abroad to improve Chinese medicine, promote complete scientificization, and benefit the people.</p>
<h3>Qiaogao Rural Improvement Society Schedules Group Wedding</h3>
<p>The Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association has scheduled the first group wedding ceremony for 10 am on the 22nd of this month at the Holiday New Auditorium in order to improve marriage customs and save grinding expenses. Everything is handled by the association, and no fees are charged. Currently, there are already three pairs of new couples who have registered. The set ceremony is extremely grand. At that time, the association's president, Du Yuesheng, will also send a car with colorful ribbons to welcome and send them off. Six hundred observation tickets have already been issued. This matter is still a first in the rural areas, and the enthusiasm of the situation at the expiration date can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shitan's Memorial Post Will Be Held</h3>
<p>On the 25th at Shiquan Street, Suzhou</p>
<p>The famous lawyer Zhang Shitan passed away on November 16th of last year. It is now scheduled to be held on the 25th of this month at his residence at No. 149 Shiquan Street in Suzhou. The funeral is collected by the Wuxian Lawyers Association. In addition to funeral expenses, it is planned to raise a substantial amount to establish a family and children education fund. The Shanghai Lawyers Association has also forwarded letters to all members.</p>
<h3>Husuul Sells Well</h3>
<p>German "Husuul" asthma medicine Felsol is a specialty for all kinds of asthma, difficulty breathing, cardiomegaly asthma, all kinds of heart disease, spasmodic cough, new and old cough, and other symptoms. After taking it, all the medicines work to cure the disease, and the effect is remarkable. It has long been praised by all sectors of the country. Now is the season when the northwest wind is blowing, and asthma and cough and other symptoms are prevalent again. I heard that the Shanghai Tongfu Road Tongde Hospital offers free gifts of the medicine to the public without charging fees. According to those who have taken it, no matter what kind of severe asthma cough or cough, it can definitely relieve asthma and stop cough within five minutes after taking it. Therefore, the sales are increasing, and there is a large shortage. This product is produced by German Roren Pharmaceutical Factory. The Chinese general manager is Huashang Luying Western Pharmacy, No. 150 Jiujiang Road, Shanghai. Also, the medicine also has a trial package, each package is sold for eight cents in national currency. Outlying areas can mail to the general manager's office in Shanghai, and postage is not counted.</p>
<h3>Dr. Li Weiguang Invented Special Effective Smoking Cessation Drug</h3>
<p>Dr. Li Weiguang, a medical doctor specializing in pediatrics who studied in Japan, founded Weiguang Hospital in Shanghai and has been in business for three years. In addition to specializing in pediatrics, he also handles internal medicine. His accurate diagnoses have won the trust of people from all walks of life. Recently, he invented a smoking cessation drug called Neo Antitoxin "An Di Du Jin" injection. The effect is miraculously effective. Whether it is a new or old heavy sugar, it can be completely eliminated within four days after injecting the drug. This drug is the result of Dr. Li's painstaking research for more than ten years, using the latest scientific methods and endocrine preparations. The effect is rapid, the medicine is peaceful, and there are no irritation or other side effects. All those who use the drug to quit have neither the strangeness of being drunk nor the danger of being unconscious. Therefore, those who quit suffer no pain at all and can continue to work as usual. This kind of smoking cessation method is truly a major invention in medicine. Dr. Li's clinic was originally located in the Kanghuan Apartment on Avenue Joffre, but the address there was insufficient. It has now been moved to No. 21, Simingli, at the intersection of Luban Road on the same road.</p>

When he left, he was wearing a striped cloth robe, leather shoes, a perm, and no hat. If anyone sees him and persuades him to go home, a small gift will be prepared, or he can be sent to Li Dongsheng's residence at Li Jiazhaizi, Luban Road.</p>

<h3>From the Reform of Health Administrative Institutions to the So-Called Problem of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Hua Xinren</p>
<p>Although we dare not lightly judge the future of national health care, we firmly believe that it will not tend to the extremes of "either Chinese or Western". It must not fundamentally overturn the existing basis of scientific medicine, nor will it be a compromise middle path of slightly infiltrating non-scientific medical forces. Because, according to the current domestic realistic health foundation, it can only accommodate a single element of autocracy, and cannot accommodate multiple elements of friction, so there is fundamentally no need to buffer the various forces. However, judging from the nature of health administration, the current work should still be carried out consistently and thoroughly, and should not be vaguely summarized because others advocate reform. The so-called dark clouds will one day radiate the brilliance of the sun and moon. On the occasion of the first year of the twenty-sixth year, I have three points to offer:</p>
<p>(A) Health administration should conform to national conditions—the so-called tailoring clothes according to the amount of cloth, and cooking rice according to the amount of rice. It should be based on individual strength. The German and Japanese methods may not be feasible in China, and the British and American methods may not conform to national conditions. Extracting the essence and taking the best, integrating the national essence, and developing work in the most practical way will have a multiplier effect. In recent years, health work has been able to proceed smoothly and win the trust of the people. Although it is said that there are responsible persons and meticulous plans, the important reason is still "conforming to national conditions." Observing the various clinics, the various rural health instructors are able to apply what they have learned to others. Lower-level cadres should be expanded later. The highest authorities of the current health administration should understand that at this stage, the people's expectations for health work are more intense than in the past. Furthermore, a health system that maintains centripetal force should be created to promote work, so as not to disappoint the people's expectations. Some people criticize the director of the Department of Health for holding too many concurrent positions, so some people advocate reform. Although it is said that the virtuous are more laborious, there must be many oversights. This is also not in line with the way of governing, and it is even less in line with governance. Therefore, it is best to carefully select capable and responsible talents who are dedicated to their work. Then, the responsibilities will be clear, the entrustment will be specialized, and everyone will be able to fulfill their duties and be loyal to their work. There will be no corruption or dereliction of duty. Furthermore, the limits of their own powers should be clearly recognized, so that there will be no usurpation of authority. (Some people criticize that the physician qualification examination should be presided over by the Examination Yuan.) It is hoped that the health administrative authorities will adopt plans that conform to national conditions, so as to avoid internal contradictions and not be criticized by others again.</p>
<p>(B) Increase the scientification of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The scientification of Traditional Chinese Medicine can indirectly increase the efficiency of the health administration foundation, and directly improve the status of national medicine. If it is on the road to science, there is a possibility of balance in academic standards. Therefore, those responsible for health administration in the future should focus on promoting the scientification of Traditional Chinese Medicine, otherwise, even if the reform of the administrative institutions is realized, the entire cause will be greatly hit. According to the facts, human beings are competitive animals, and human society is also a competitive society. Without competition, there would be no human survival, and no human progress. The result of competition is survival of the fittest, and the survival of the superior and the elimination of the inferior. Therefore, here we confirm that the success or failure of individuals, the prosperity or decline of nations, and the rise and fall of countries are all built on the form of competition. The backwardness of Japanese Kampo medicine is also because it has lost the elements of competition. Therefore, before the reform of the health administrative institutions, promoting the scientification of national medicine is an urgent need. The issue of reforming the administrative institutions should be fully considered. If we are still focused on current countermeasures and ignore long-term plans, we will be unfaithful to the trust of the country.</p>
<p>(C) Increase the establishment of research departments—Our country's health administration focuses more on Western medicine. This is also the main reason for the increase in opposition from Traditional Chinese Medicine. Judging from the situation, the reform of the administrative institutions is absolutely impossible. Even if some people are in charge of the reform and are determined to persist, the result will only be to promote the power struggle between Traditional Chinese and Western medicine, leading to the internal collapse of the health administration. Because of this reason, the establishment of a national medicine research department is the principle of adjusting this dispute. The research department can recruit national medicine experts to conduct joint research, and promote and develop national medicine and national drugs in a scientific way, so that China's inherent national essence—treatment agents—can become something that is applicable and scientific. At the same time, we can also break the traditional contradictory feudal thinking of "Chinese learning for the body, Western learning for the use" and "Traditional Chinese medicine is good at treating internal medicine, and Western medicine is proficient in surgery." Therefore, in terms of academics, we may as well have open and honest discussions. In terms of academic competition, we must not abandon our responsibilities. Therefore, I firmly believe that if we focus on status, power, and personnel, and abandon academic research, it will not benefit the cause. What we need now is public medical construction, reducing mortality, and improving the health of the entire nation, rather than mutually fighting, squeezing, and flaunting. Therefore, to accomplish this work, we can only stand under the banner of medical construction, be kind to each other, and coexist and prosper to seek happiness for mankind and welfare for society. I think it is better than advocating the reform of health administrative institutions through the struggle for power.</p>
<p>The above three points are very simple expectations. Now is not the time when we can accomplish anything with empty words, but the era when we must express ourselves with strength. The health cause is a heavy responsibility and a long journey. We must be down-to-earth and work hard, and we will never be able to achieve results through speculation and luck. Therefore, in the future, we should avoid frivolous and empty talk, and pay attention to practical construction. Finally, I hope that the domestic Chinese and Western medical communities can produce a few more Pasteurs, Jenners, Listers, and Kochs. It is more efficient than empty words of reform.</p>
<h3>Talking About Cancer (3)</h3>
<p>— Zuxiao</p>
<p>Cancer is the famous Rous's chicken sarcoma. Rouscbe Sarkom. However, although this chicken sarcoma can be inoculated for generations (using the filtered liquid of the sarcoma), on the one hand, the product of this inoculation presents an abnormal state in culture, not like other cancer cells. On the other hand, Rous chicken sarcoma is only one type of malignant scar tumor and cannot be universally applied. Furthermore, common infectious diseases all cause inflammatory reactions and tissue formation. Why is there only tumor formation here? This is also an incomprehensible question. As for the discovery of parasites or plants in cancer cells, there are many illustrations. After careful examination, it is known that what is seen in these stained specimens is nothing more than so-called intracellular storage. It is a degraded substance in the formed body. However, the morphology is somewhat like parasites!</p>
<p>There is also considerable factual evidence for the theory of stimulation. For example, cancer in workers in white wax factories, lip swelling in old pipe smokers, etc. The most powerful empirical evidence is the tar cancer created by Mr. Yamagiwa, a Japanese student studying in Europe. He tirelessly and tirelessly applied tar to the ears of rabbits every day. After 55 to 300 days of persistent stimulation, the skin here would first develop keratin hyperplasia, papilloma-like tumors, and then grow into true cancer. The main cause of this is certainly the direct physical and indirect chemical action. At the time, some people suspected that there might be a special chemical substance in tar that could cause cancer, but it was not found. It is said that someone has now analyzed it, but as far as I know, it is not just tar alone that can cause cancer. Eosin, Sudan III, paraffin, etc. all have the same effect. Therefore, even if tar can cause cancer, what is caused is only one type of cancer (with less toxicity). However, chemical substances equivalent to it also have the same effect. From this, it is speculated that tar cancer only proves that long-term stimulation has the ability to form cancer and cannot be hastily extended to the universal cause of cancer. Even if the analyzed substance is the main cause of cancer, it is only the main cause of one type of cancer, that is, what Borst calls carcinoid. The success of tar cancer is due to Jamagiwa in 1914. The success of this experiment was quite shocking at the time, and it is still being studied continuously. Although it has not yet been able to achieve its original intention, its merits have reached an indelible state. Because if scholars want to obtain readily available and unfailing artificial cancer in their research on cancer, this method is the most reliable, and they can watch its formation step by step, so it is even more valuable. In the work of observing the evolution and formation process of cancer, tar cancer really gives us valuable tools.</p>
<p>Finally, there is Borst's view. He excludes everything. He holds on to the cell itself, relying on all kinds of anatomy, pathological anatomy, embryology, and physiological knowledge. He believes that the formation of cancer is still a change in the cell itself that is different from the usual and known in pathology. The static cause is of course the so-called disposition, and the dynamic cause is inconsistent. The formation of cancer is also a complementary reaction, but because it itself has the ability of unlimited autonomous growth, it does not follow the usual rules, does not obey the central command, so the result is that the tail is too big to wag, and raising a tumor becomes a disease. It changes into a tissue that erodes organs and destroys the body. Just like the confused orders of the elderly, the original intention is not bad, but the strength and reason are not enough, and it often does not help but is harmful. This view, although it seems to have a bit of argumentative color, is the closest and most reasonable when viewed from an objective perspective.</p>
<p>Now it's time to talk about how cancer grows. According to the observation of various pathological theories, the clinical observation of doctors, the examples of animal experiments in the laboratory, and experience. We can say that the preliminary stage of cancer formation, no matter what its dynamic cause is, must first have the unsound or decadent changes in the tissue itself that is invaded by the cancer. The congenital predisposition is of course also regarded as the same and included in it. For example, long-term illness and injury, persistent stimulation, etc. For example, a long-term stomach ulcer can become the starting point of stomach cancer. (Present-day pathologists do not talk about stomach ulcers but talk about ulcer predisposition!)! Sclerotic liver can become the source of liver cancer. However, sclerosis is sclerosis, liver cancer is liver cancer, and there is also the distinction between true and bile duct liver cancer. Some of the readers should not mistake it for a talk! There is also an interesting experiment reported by Doderlein. Animals fed with cholesterin have a 40% efficiency of being prone to and strongly developing artificial cancer. This can also be regarded as the possibility that the body, due to special nourishment, undergoes metabolic functions that damage cells and make them susceptible to the formation of cancer. In terms of race, according to European statistics, Jews have the most cancer. Races with backward cultures have less. Between the two sexes, women have more. Especially the breast and reproductive organs account for the majority. Cancer of the digestive system is more common in the East. Liver cancer is a common disease in China and Japan. (Statistics of Mr. Nagayo) In terms of the age of people, those who suffer from cancer are mostly in their fifties or sixties, or later, and the least around thirty. (There are sarcomas), but this is not a golden rule. There are examples of newborn children suffering from cancer! Originally, strictly speaking, truly healthy body compositions only account for a minority of human beings, and those with invisible defects are in the majority. Of course, there are also many cancer predisposing factors here! No wonder the occurrence of cancer is so common and unceasing!</p>
<p>Since the types of cancer are roughly divided into glandular cancer and epithelial pain, all places where cancer can grow are explained by these two goals. Skin, various ducts, stomach, liver, pancreas, uterus, ovary, prostate, and lips are the most and most obvious parts affected by cancer.</p>

<h3>Medical Problems of Shanghai Poor People's Shelters</h3>
<p>— Li Caihua</p>
<p>Regarding the true situation of the poor people's shelters and the lives of the poor people in the shelters, I have already written another interview report that was published in the Shanghai edition supplement of this newspaper on January 12. I will omit it here.</p>
<p>I always feel that no matter whether it is a charity or a social undertaking, as long as there are people, medical issues are always quite important; because without it, charities seem to feel that there is a flaw; social undertakings are inevitably somewhat "all in vain". The poor, as everyone knows, are poor without clothes and poor without food. It is really a thing that would make me happy and a blessing for the poor, to have these poor people's shelters set up by Shanghai charitable organizations, and which are now in their eighth session. Of course, the poor cannot be separated from medicine, and it is very urgent. Since the poor cannot be separated from medicine, medical problems arise in the poor people's shelters.</p>
<p>Now, please give me your guidance.</p>
<p>The first point is regarding physical examinations. Strict physical examinations should begin when the poor people enter the shelter. Because the poor have no home to return to, no clothes to wear, and no food to eat, they inevitably suffer from sun and dew, and they are hungry and not full, and their nutrition is very poor. Moreover, because of the different occupations, they are in the lowest and worst lower-class society. What good things do you think can be done living in a lower-class society? Naturally, they are influenced by what they see and hear, and they are all treacherous, thieves, lewd, and evil. Their words and deeds are even more vulgar and scattered. Some have syphilis, some take morphine injections, some take red pills, and some smoke opium. In short, there is no end to them. If we check him as soon as he enters the door, those who have syphilis or other infectious diseases will be sent to the hospital, those who take morphine, red pills, or smoke opium will be sent to the drug rehabilitation hospital, and those with ordinary colds will be isolated. Medical treatment will be extended to those who remain in the shelter. Absolutely separate patients from non-patients, because originally what he affected outside was small, but now it affects the lives of all people in the shelter. In order to protect the lives of all poor people in the shelter, we must first carry out extremely strict physical examinations.</p>
<p>The second point is that we not only check for the first time and then consider it finished, but we also check once a week as far as possible, at least once a month, in order to see how far their health has progressed during the three or four months of shelter in the poor people's shelter, and who has progressed more than whom. Make a health chart and faithfully fill in their health status every week or month to serve as a reference for promoting the health of the poor in the next session. As for doctors, I think it is not difficult to make a special appointment with several free hospitals to ask several doctors to do some volunteer work for the benefit of the poor.</p>
<p>The third point is regarding air circulation. According to the number of poor people in the shelter now, there are about 1,400 people. The rooms are small, there are many people, and there are few windows. Naturally, there is more carbon dioxide than oxygen inside. No matter how you breathe, there is less oxygen and more carbon dioxide, and the health of the body will inevitably change. I think it is possible to use their original organization—the shift system, thirteen people in a shift, led by the shift leader, to go to the wilderness every morning and evening to take a walk, breathe fresh air, and change the new environment. Do a few simple stretching exercises, which is of great benefit to the body and mind.</p>
<p>As for diet, do as much as possible to ensure that they are nourished enough.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the shelter management will make a thorough statistics of the diseases, types, causes, and causes of death of the poor, so as to compare and improve with the next session, so that the poor can have a more "healthy, happy, peaceful, and safe" environment.</p>
<p>The above are just some of the things that the author has thought of. Of course, there are many things that have not been thought of. Here, I dare to ask people from all walks of life to give unceremonious guidance. At the same time, I sincerely appeal to people from all walks of life to donate generously and continuously, not letting a penny fall into vain.</p>
<h3>Prevention of Tooth Decay</h3>
<p>— Ren Junming</p>
<p>Tooth decay is mostly caused by bacterial erosion. The places in our mouth where dirt is most easily accumulated, the opportunities for bacteria to erode, and the prevention methods are briefly described below.</p>
<p>The parts of the teeth that are easily eroded can be divided into three parts. ㊀ The crown of the tooth. (That is, the occlusal surface.) Because it is uneven and has cracks, it is most easy to retain food debris, allowing bacteria to grow. ㊁ The adjacent surface. (That is, the side of the tooth seam.) There are gaps here that can be taken advantage of. Meat fibers and residual food fragments are most easily attached and fermented and eroded. ㊂ The neck of the tooth. This place often has fine substances in saliva that settle and attach. When brushing teeth, it is not cleaned. After accumulating for a long time, it becomes tartar. It is also a good place to hide bacteria.</p>
<p>The opportunities for bacteria to erode teeth can also be divided into several points, which are briefly described below. ㊀ Accumulation of dirt is not cleaned, bacteria breed, and erosion occurs. ㊁ The temperature of food is too cold or too hot, causing rapid changes in the shrinkage and expansion of the tooth substance, resulting in cracks for bacteria to invade. ㊂ Liking to eat hard objects, such as pork bones and fruit pits, chewing too hard can easily cause the tooth substance to be worn and cracked, allowing bacteria to take advantage of it. ㊃ Liking to use metal toothpicks, the neck of the tooth is often attacked, resulting in damage and hiding bacteria. ㊄ Liking to decorate, indiscriminately inlaying gold teeth. If the technician's inlay is not precise, or inferior materials are used, the cement between the tooth neck and the gold crown will gradually fall off, resulting in the accumulation of bacteria and food debris. ㊅ Itinerant quacks, whose instruments are not disinfected, transmit bacteria into the mouth. Moreover, their instruments are rough and damage the tooth substance, allowing bacteria to take the opportunity to enter. ㊆ Misusing rough tooth powder, which thins the tooth substance, resulting in demineralization. ㊇ Greedy for cheapness, using inferior mouthwash, which damages the enamel of the teeth. ㊈ Often using hard-bristled toothbrushes.</p>
<p>The many opportunities for tooth decay have been described above. Therefore, if you think about treating it after it has decayed, it is better to prevent it before it happens. The prevention methods are described below.</p>
<p>1. Check your oral cavity. Please ask a dentist to check it twice a year. Carefully examine it. Fill in the missing ones. Pull out the remaining ones. Clean the dirty ones.</p>
<p>2. After getting up in the morning, before going to bed, and after each meal, you should brush your teeth and rinse your mouth to keep them clean.</p>
<p>3. Tooth powder and mouthwash should be selected with fine quality and without harming the tooth substance. After using the toothbrush, it should be dried.</p>
<p>4. Do not eat things that are too hard, too cold, or too hot.</p>
<p>5. Toothpicks should be made of wood and have elasticity.</p>
<p>6. You should rinse your mouth immediately after eating sugary foods and do not eat too much.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Q&amp;A About Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(99) Addison's Disease</p>
<p>Q: What is Addison's Disease?</p>
<p>A: Addison's Disease is a disease of the adrenal glands. It was first recorded by the British physician Thomas Addison in 1885, hence the name.</p>
<p>Q: What are the causes of Addison's Disease?</p>
<p>A: The true cause is still uncertain. But in reality, it is due to decreased function of the adrenal glands. The causes of this functional decline are nothing more than adrenal tuberculosis, tumors, syphilis, adrenal atrophy, adrenal hematoma, etc.</p>
<p>Q: If the adrenal glands are surgically removed, can this disease also occur?</p>
<p>A: The symptoms that occur after adrenalectomy are very similar to those of Addison's Disease.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms that occur after adrenalectomy?</p>
<p>A: General muscle weakness, malnutrition, nervous system disorders (drowsiness, lethargy, epilepsy, dilated pupils, etc.), low blood pressure, low body temperature, subcutaneous pigmentation, etc.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of Addison's Disease?</p>
<p>A: The symptoms develop relatively slowly. There is also muscle weakness. Neurological symptoms include mental fatigue, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, insomnia, memory loss, dullness, etc. Digestion is also impaired, such as lack of gastric juice secretion, belching, vomiting, hiccups, stomach pain, etc. Sometimes diarrhea occurs.</p>
<p>Q: Does pigmentation occur in the cortex as well?</p>
<p>A: This is a unique symptom of the disease. Generally, brownish pigmentation occurs on the face, neck, and back of the hands. Areas that are naturally more pigmented become even darker. Pigmentation also occurs on the lips, gums, palate, and buccal mucosa, resembling the appearance of black people.</p>
<p>Q: Is this disease dangerous after it occurs?</p>
<p>A: It is absolutely incurable. The causes of death are weakness, exhaustion, and neurological symptoms.</p>
<p>Q: How fast or slow is the course of the disease?</p>
<p>A: Most cases are chronic. However, if it is combined with fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, the course becomes acute.</p>
<p>Q: When diagnosing Addison's Disease, what other diseases should it be differentiated from?</p>
<p>A: It should be differentiated from chloasma during pregnancy, the dark skin of vagrants, arsenic pigmentation, silver poisoning, acanthosis nigricans, Basedow's disease, etc.</p>
<p>Q: What is the treatment for this disease?</p>
<p>A: Use large amounts of adrenal preparations, adrenal extracts, adrenaline, etc., injected three or four times a day. Or surgical adrenal transplantation, etc. But the hope is very small. (End)</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of Medical and Health in Haining County (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xia Canglin</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>When it comes to watching the tide, no one doesn't know that Zhejiang Province has Haining County. In particular, the large-scale meningitis epidemic in Zhuqiao in the 19th year and the New Life Movement Lantern Festival in Xiashi in the 23rd year caused a sensation far and wide. And the case of the Haining County Magistrate being punished for dereliction of duty in handling the opium case, embezzling 14,450 yuan, which was widely reported in the daily newspapers in March of this year, has even more deeply imprinted the name "Haining" in the minds of people across the country. Haining is passed through by the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway (Xiashi is a station) and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Xiashi town, in particular, is representative of the entire county. Regarding the sanitary survey of Xiashi, this journal once published the survey report of Mr. Shen Songnian, a national doctor from Xiashi. Now I will supplement the medical and health conditions of the entire county. Perhaps this will be welcomed by comrades in the field of sanitation.</p>
<p>The Past and Present of Public Health Facilities in the Entire County</p>
<p>The public health of Haining can be said to have no special record. In the past, the County Public Security Bureau (19th year) also set up a health section. The person in charge was Dr. Yang Zujiong. Dr. Yang graduated from Nantong Medical College and passed the Class A health administration personnel examination. He was a very willing and responsible person in research. He also earnestly planned for the entire county's health administration. However, due to financial reasons, the authorities were unable to adopt Dr. Yang's recommendations. Only during the meningitis epidemic in Zhuqiao was a large-scale epidemic prevention carried out. Tens of thousands of yuan were spent to set up five epidemic prevention stations. This can be said to be the most valuable page in the history of Haining's public health. However, from a negative perspective, it is a sign of the imperfection of Haining's public health. Otherwise, there would not have been such a large epidemic. Since the 21st year, the health section has also been cancelled, and even the health committee, which was resolved but not implemented, has been silent. The groups related to medicine and health in Haining include:</p>
<p>(1) Haining County Health Committee</p>
<p>(2) Haining County Temporary Epidemic Prevention Committee</p>
<p>(3) Haining County County Hospital Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>(4) Haining County Opium Suppression Committee</p>
<p>(5) Ningyan Doctors Association</p>
<p>(6) Haining Traditional Chinese Medicine Association</p>
<p>However, (1) to (4) have mostly disappeared. Although the county government has recently established health personnel, a formal county clinic or county hospital has not yet been established. Over the years, health affairs have still been handled by the Public Security Bureau. The only things that can be recorded are the annual smallpox vaccination and epidemic prevention injections (delegated by the county government to designated hospitals in various places as voluntary agents). As for the health sports meetings in the winter and summer seasons, they can be said to be routine official business. Although they are held on schedule, apart from shouting slogans, posting slogans, holding meetings, and parades, it is questionable whether they have any impact on public health or whether they can stimulate the general public.</p>

<p>Short Talk</p>
<h3>Save the Children</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>Some time ago, the bizarre phenomenon of primary school students "entering the mountains to seek enlightenment" occurred, which had already announced the serious crisis in modern primary school education. Now, the foolish act of primary school students "seeking wealth through divination" has occurred again. Modern primary school education is truly worthy of our concern.</p>
<p>The fact is this: Li Minghua, a primary school student studying at a certain school, passed by a fortune-telling stall near the school every day. The fortune-teller, who specialized in using flowery words to swindle people out of their money, found out that Li Minghua's family was quite wealthy. Therefore, he put effort into this naive child. He told him that he had a kind of "miraculous technique" that could turn each yuan of legal tender into one hundred yuan. Li Minghua was deceived by him and immediately took 120 yuan of legal tender from his home and gave it to the "all-powerful" fortune-teller. The fortune-teller chanted incantations and ordered Li to close his eyes tightly. Then, he handed him a bag and told him to quickly return home, saying that there were 12,000 yuan in the bag. As soon as Li arrived home, he opened the bag and saw that it was just a stack of yellow paper! Knowing that he had been deceived, he immediately told his mother. Fortunately, the fortune-teller had not escaped and was taken to the police station.</p>
<p>Originally, education is regarded by some as "noble" and "sacred", but in essence, it is nothing more than a deceptive talk. Education is still restricted by a specific society. The feudal era had education adapted to the feudal era, and modern society naturally has education adapted to the modern era. Since society has progressed to the stage of exchanging goods with "currency", and currency has evolved from "cowhide" and the like to "money", this "money" monster has been regarded as a symbol of "power". Whoever has more money has greater "power". Who doesn't like to be a "power holder"? Therefore, education encourages people to make a fortune, and parents also regard their children as tools for "getting promoted and making a fortune". Giving them education is nothing more than investing "capital", hoping not only to get it back in the future but also to have the assurance of "earning more". In this way, although a child's mind is filled with the idea of getting rich, you don't believe it, just grab a child and ask him: "Why are you studying?" Most of them will answer you: "After studying, knowing how to read, I can do business in the future." Thinking this way in childhood, in adulthood, they will have the idea of becoming an official!</p>
<p>Now is the time of great danger for our nation. "Entering the mountains to seek enlightenment" is said to be for "saving the country", and there is still room for "understanding". However, this kind of "superstitious" foolish act can be said to be a great crisis in education. I want to shout to the primary school education community across the country: "Save the children!"</p>
<h3>Sea</h3>
<p>— Huiying</p>
<p>I have read many articles about the sea, and heard many stories of the sea. I long to see the sea that is as quiet as a maiden when calm, and as fierce as a warrior when enraged. It feeds millions of humans, but also swallows millions of humans. But this is the first time I have the opportunity to live near the sea.</p>
<p>With a heart of apprehension and shyness, I stepped onto the embankment. They say the sea is ahead, but all I see are white waves lying behind a long sandy beach, like a flock of birds pecking at food. A line of green edges seems to be inlaid on the edge of the land. Only these are the sea. I can't help but be disappointed. I wanted to climb down the embankment, walk across the beach, and go near to see what the sea is like, but my relatives who accompanied me did not allow it, saying that it was high tide and it would be dangerous to go.</p>
<p>What they said was so terrible that I gave up the idea of going to the seaside, but insisted that he accompany me to see how the sea walks from this mile-long distance to the embankment. Watching, I gradually felt bored. Although these small white waves seemed to be coming, they were so slow, as if an old man with a cane was striding forward. Waiting, waiting, it got dark, and I could no longer insist on dragging my relatives with me. I couldn't spend the night on the embankment. How much I wanted to see the posture of the sea coming, and the silver sea surface in the moonlight!</p>
<p>The next day I caught up with the embankment, the sun shone so</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>powerfully, but the sea ran even further away, so far that I doubted that there was a sea here, and doubted the reason why these yellow lands were not cultivated. I walked down the embankment, fine sand jumped into my shoes, shells were scattered on the ground. After walking a few feet, the sand was wet and sunk into my feet, only then did I believe that the sea had stepped here. With a nostalgic mood, I visited the footprints left by the sea step by step, but there were only shells and seaweed. The sea was gone, as if he had returned to that home from somewhere overnight. I looked at the sun, although it seemed bigger and more powerful than in the city, but shining on the yellow sandy shore, I always felt disgusted.</p>
<p>This day I became a sea memorialist. For the first time, I thought that this feeling might be what is called the feeling of unrequited love. I have never had the experience of unrequited love.</p>
<p>A lost dream is sweet, and the dream comforts your pain. In the middle of the night, I dreamed that the tide was rising, and the sea was roaring. I jumped up happily, jumped up, rolled from the embankment into the turbulent sea, rolled in, but I rolled on the edge of the bed, almost rolling to the ground. I woke up, and I still suspected that I was dreaming, how powerfully the sea roared.</p>
<p>A kind of low, angry sound, the sound of the waves surging against the shore had a long, sharp whistle, chaotic and grand. This sound rang on the roof, about to crush the house, flatten my head; like many horses galloping past the house, maybe they would trample this thatched cottage. I half-feared and pricked up my ears to listen carefully to this magnificent, majestic roar. This breath of nature made me tremble.</p>
<p>Was the sea angry? Angry that the footprints were blurred? Or was the sea calling to those who missed him? I became cowardly, dare not open the door, it seemed that the sea was standing by the door, dare not go to visit him, and regarded him as a terrible villain. With a satisfied and uneasy heart, I fell asleep again.</p>
<p>The second morning, it was not dawn yet, and I got up. Stepping on the wet grass, passing through the fog, I walked up to the embankment. Oh, isn't that the sea at my feet? He not only ran over overnight, but also grew very high. The embankment that was more than a zhang high was only three or four chi high today. Looking forward, the fog blocked my sight, a piece of white, but also distinguished that it was jumping and shouting all night. Near the shore, the waves were turning with various patterns, like cats catching mice, hitting the shore, one rolling on the other's back.</p>
<p>The sun rose, the morning mist gradually dissipated like a wisp of light smoke, the salty water vapor washed my nose and face. The sea surface was first a sea of blood half red, and then became strips of golden snakes wriggling and jumping. Looking over, there was no land, only the sea, the sea.</p>
<h3>Night</h3>
<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>I had been living in the Longji Hotel not far from the small railway station for about half a month. We had dispelled the suspicion of that white-haired, one-armed old man. In his spare time in the morning and evening, like all old people, he would trivially turn over his past days, both joyful and sad, and sigh with one accord. Recollection, whether it is suffering or happiness, seems to be a poem for people with gray hair. However, we rarely see old people who regard the past as an enemy, like that old Jin Fu who lost an arm, who became half-crazy with anger at the mention of the past. – Perhaps the world we lived in the past was another world, and old Jin Fu once shed his weak body over sixty years old, his weak soul, and unknown old tears in a world of slavery, abuse, humiliation, and no sun – two or three years (only two or three years!)! The hellish torture of the past made him have a near-mad nerve, suspecting and fearing even more than a mouse, and his hatred for the base, filthy, and cruel world was even more than fire – the fire burning in the old man's body!</p>
<p>This day, it was night again. The guests washed their hands and feet, and under the smoky kerosene lamp, they talked noisily about the outside world they had seen during the day, spewing out the fatigue and distress they could not get rid of in the conversation like the black smoke of the kerosene lamp. Old Jin Fu, who had now lost his initial fear of us, routinely stuck his head out of the paper window, then closed the window, as if saying to himself, he said softly: "It's snowing again outside."</p>
<p>Then, from the dim red light of the kerosene lamp, he suspiciously swept his old eyes over everyone's faces, but then seemed relieved, and in a low and strange voice, he began to speak: "When you came from the small railway station, did you also pay attention? The station nameplate at the small station has also been added with crooked Japanese characters."</p>
<p>He stared at us especially, as if because we had come from that small railway station half a month ago, he wanted us to confirm that matter. And we did see that eye-catching thing, which seemed to be only half or a part of a Chinese character, which made us deeply distressed, but we finally nodded silently, confirming these ominous facts for Old Jin Fu.</p>
<p>"This place is going to suffer again," Old Jin Fu continued, this time his voice was not as gentle as before, as if something was stuck in his throat, he choked, and even the words were not clear.</p>
<p>"Yes, I said," it's exactly the same! Three years ago, in my hometown, there were also guests from outside who said that there were Japanese characters at the station, and this world would not be ours! – Yes, it wasn't.</p>
<p>"People were much more stupid at that time, who would believe that such a thing would happen? At that time, it was the end of autumn, and people were rushing to work in the fields for their lives. Two or three months after the green gauze tents rose, it started to snow, like it is now, one flake, two flakes,..."</p>
<p>Old Jin Fu's teeth also began to chatter, as if the cruel past was about to be re-enacted immediately. "On a snowy night, many soldiers and gun carriages came from the station,... The bright bayonets made a rustling sound as they stepped on the snow. There was the sound of gunfire in the distance. People were awakened from their dreams – at that time, I had not lost that arm, and the twenty-one-year-old child was as strong as a calf, and the old woman would curse the endless poor and hard days day and night, and there was still sorghum growing in the fields..."</p>
<p>"But just like that, they were driven away, inexplicably. The Japanese became more and more aggressive, ransacking house after house, grabbing strong young children to be conscripted as volunteers. They dragged them to the headquarters and killed dozens of them for no reason. They also grabbed people to torture – they grabbed me and asked how long the child had been a volunteer and who his partners were... But wasn't the child doing farm work at home? Who could say anything? They tortured me and cut off my arm. I was imprisoned for two years..."</p>
<p>"I don't know how the days outside were spent, but when I came out, I didn't recognize this old hometown at all. So many lovely children died like pigs and dogs, and the women were also abused to death in the dark corners. In the distance, there was that unfamiliar flag, damn the sun, it was the mark of the butcher...!"</p>
<p>"From this time on, this world has no part for us."</p>
<p>Old Jin Fu shuddered in fear, and everyone felt a little strange! That world was definitely not a dream, everyone thought so. Maybe this small town will soon...?</p>
<p>The snow was very heavy, and it was pitch black outside. Someone was walking on the muddy ground, making a rustling sound. The people under the kerosene lamp stopped talking, and there were already crystal tears in the old man's eyes!</p>
<p>Someone was knocking on the door urgently.</p>

<h3>Ballad Singing</h3>
<p>Cao Xiaoying "Jade Dragonfly"</p>
<p>China West (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Romance of the Beauties"</p>
<p>Romance of the Beauties sings out loud. It is the truth of right and wrong. I will speak it, you will listen, no more than a game for leisure. Flower branch sisters returned to Yu Shun, that is, Ehuang and Nuying. Xia Mejixi was extravagant by nature, using wine as swimming pools and meat as forests. Hengji wanted to harm loyal and good people, and cleverly set up the torture of branding. King You of Zhou tempted Bao Si to laugh, and the beacon fires were set off for no reason. Xi Shi, a woman in the village of Luoluo, forgot Wu to take revenge for the Yue ruler. Xiang Yu of Wujiang committed suicide at Gaixia, and Concubine Yu martyred herself for all time. Leaving the country to make peace was unavoidable, and Zhao Jun sighed far away from his homeland. Limitless joy in the gentleness, Flying Swallow danced lightly on the palm. The beauty of Yin Lihua was passed down to Guangwu, and she unexpectedly became empress and assisted in the revival. The eighteen melodies of the barbarian flute returned to the Eastern Han Dynasty, and Wen Ji's harmony was admirable. The Two Qiaos were not locked up by A Man, leaving only the Bronze Sparrow Terrace to talk about the deep spring. Xue Lingyun's needlework was praised as a masterpiece, and she gained fame in the Wei Palace at night. Green Pearl fell from the building with a purpose, vowing to protect her chastity and not marry. Zhang Lihua was favored by Emperor Chen, and her hair shone deeply with grace. Hong Fu, with her discerning eyes, recognized a hero, but she was in love and eloped privately. Empress Wu Zetian was ruthless, poisoning her mother and killing the emperor to seize the throne. On the seventh day of the seventh month, in the Palace of Eternal Life, Tai Zhen expressed her feelings in the middle of the night. Willow waist, cherry lips, Xiao Man and Fan Su matched the poet. The heroic Liang Hongyu personally held the mallet and drums to fight the Jin soldiers. Dong Xiaowan in Yanming Tower, with her talent and beauty, excelled in painting. Countless beauties have existed since ancient times, and history books have already recorded them clearly. I will put down my pen for a while and leave it here.</p>
<p>Jiang Binchu "Three Smiles"</p>
<p>New Sound (1380) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Three Smiles, Plate Appearance"</p>
<p>One night of hazy sleep, restless. I hate myself for having too few rules. I reluctantly get up, endlessly bored. I see the Buddha statue in the hall, without shadow or form. Still majestic and conspicuous at the gate. Enter the middle gate. Up to the upper floor. I only hear the oriole and swallow sounds calling for the new people. I ask Tang Xing as if waking up from a dream in Handan. I realize that I was tricked and my intelligence was wasted. I hate Zhishan. Too unreasonable. The severance of friendship must be renewed today. In the study, there is a dispute. The news reports that the Prime Minister has arrived at the Dragon Pavilion. I think that he is highly respected. He is old. He is coming in a fit of anger. Although there are many talented men in front of me. How can they be as good as Yunming in resolving disputes. A wonderful plan arises during the conversation. Please ask Shi Tianweng to be the first to welcome the respected elder. Chou Zhou Wen Zhu followed. They walked out of the hall in a line. The Grand Master started to speak eloquently. I am here to pursue the escaped servant to Wu Men. The scholars listened and smiled slightly. Half mocking, half persuading, half</p>

<p>relying on each other. Nothing more than Wei Hao's good friends are different from Zhu Xizhe. Arguing forcefully, the words are chaotic. He spoke so well that Hongshan's anger gradually calmed down. He cheated out the deed of sale on the spot. It seemed that Lu Lian was reborn today. He said, if you want to see Jiu Niang, you must enter the inner room. Order the boy to lead him to the room. A great event of the day turned to ice.</p>

<p>Yuanchang (1120) 6:00 AM to 6:30 AM</p>
<p>(1) Lectures on the biographies of Chinese artists of past dynasties.</p>
<p>(2) Teaching the second volume of radio lectures on Chinese and Western painting.</p>
<h3>Afterthoughts</h3>
<p>According to a letter from Yuanchang Radio Station, the "Meteor" singing program listed in "Tomorrow's Program" on the 16th did not take place at the station, and a correction is urgently needed. However, more troubles will follow, so this is a respectful notice to all broadcasting groups: please do not submit broadcasting manuscripts until you have properly contacted the radio station. Thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>The Fenghuang Music and Singing Society has perfect organization and outstanding talent, and is very popular in all circles. Due to the fact that the existing members are insufficient to distribute, we are now specially recruiting male and female singers who are interested in radio broadcasting. The monthly salary will be discussed in person. Those who are interested, please send your resumes and skills to Mr. Hua Qing c/o No. 142 Lane, Saposai Road. If suitable, an interview will be arranged.</p>

<h3>Coffee Shop Price War</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Tangjie opened a coffee shop called "Meimei Coffee Shop," and Xiao Chen Cao Xuesong opened a "Lili Coffee Shop" opposite Mr. Wang's shop, competing with each other and refusing to give in. You lower the price, and I lower the price too. You buy one get one free, and I buy one get two free. As a result, both sides were hurt. This performance completely exposes the weaknesses of businessmen in the current recession.</p>
<p>Taishan Danger</p>
<p>Nanjing and Shanghai Simultaneously Showing the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<h3>Torch Drama Society Rehearses "Our Hometown" and "Smuggling"</h3>
<p>Continuing the vigorous phenomenon of the drama scene in the past year, the development of Chinese drama movement at the beginning of this year is even more active.</p>
<p>The birth of the "Torch" Drama Society. The members of "Torch" are young people who are exceptionally dedicated to theatrical work. The first public performance has selected the collective three-act play "Our Hometown" written by Zhang Min, published in the 7th issue of the 1st volume of the semi-monthly magazine "Guangming" - directed by Mr. Ling He, one of the collective playwrights. The actors include Miss Xia Xia, who has won praise for her performance in "Sai Jinhua." and the one-act play "Smuggling" written by Hong Shen in the first issue of "Guangming." The play "Smuggling" has been performed dozens of times in the mainland, such as Nanjing and Guangdong, and each performance was sold out, which shows the audience's support for national defense dramas. Shanghai has not heard of any official performances due to the strict objective environmental restrictions. It is said that the scripts such as "Our Hometown" and "Smuggling" have been revised and approved by the Social Bureau and that future performances will definitely cause a sensation.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from "Freedom Soul"</h3>
<p>Qiu Jin's Costume Problem</p>
<p>Ms. Lan Lan, who is in charge of costumes for the 40s Drama Society, has been running around for the costume problem of "Freedom Soul" recently. Not only is she running around, but she is also asking and discussing with people. According to Ms. Lan, although "Freedom Soul" is immediately after "Sai Jinhua" in terms of time period, there are some differences in costumes. At that time, women's clothes were longer than the knees, and the sleeves were thin and long, and the trousers were also slim and long, and the most fashionable Jiangnan style was the most beautiful with red trim. As for Qiu Jin's Japanese kimono, in terms of the popular style at the time, a long skirt had to be added to the kimono. At that time, Japanese intellectuals liked to wear a pair of glasses, because if they didn't, they seemed unable to show the dignity of intellectuals (?).</p>
<p>Jin Cheng Theater Plans to Renovate Footlights and Top Lights and Make Spotlights</p>
<p>Since the performance of "Sai Jinhua," the 40s Drama Society has been very dissatisfied with the theater's lighting equipment, and the most dissatisfied person is naturally the lighting expert Ouyang Shanzun. Therefore, before the performance of "Freedom Soul," Ouyang Shanzun drew up a design and asked Jin Cheng to renovate the footlights and add some top lights and spotlights to make it more perfect and suitable for the lighting conditions of the stage. It is said that Jin Cheng has already intended to adopt it.</p>
<p>Women's Hair in Qiu Jin's Time</p>
<p>Xin Hanwen, the makeup master of the 40s, was very busy during the performance of "Sai Jinhua." Recently, Xin often said when talking about this, "I can't stand it! I can't stand it!" and plans to hire one or two assistants to help with the performance of "Freedom Soul." Someone asked how the clothes of ordinary women in the Qiu Jin era were? He replied: "This is Ms. Lan's specialty, not Lao Xin's responsibility." The questioner was naturally not satisfied with this answer, so he immediately asked about the style of hair. Xin immediately sang before the questioner finished speaking, "Long bangs, curved parting, and a tail in the back."</p>
