<h3>關於華僑教育的幾點建議</h3>
<p>— 吳俊升</p>
<p>記者最近因為攷察美國教育的機會，也參觀和調查了許多在美國設立的華僑學校：當時很感覺華僑教育的重要，同時也發現有許多應該改進的地方。現在建議幾點，以供留心華僑教育的人士的參攷。</p>
<p>華僑教育的重要，自不待言。華僑過去對於祖國的貢獻，有一部分不能不歸功於華僑教育。今後要維持僑胞和祖國的聯繋，尤其不能不留心華僑教育。依有些國家（如美國）的法律，土生的子女，卽屬於所在國的國籍。這種身分的規定，很容易使土生子女忘懷祖國。可是直到現在，一般華僑子弟的祖國意識，還是很深强，愛國的情緒，還是很熱烈，這不能不歸功於華僑學校：因為華僑學校敎授祖國的語言文字和歷史地理，所以他們至今沒有忘懷祖國，愛國的表現，有時比國內的同胞還要熱切。就記者在美國所看到許多華僑學校而論，它們都大體使人滿意。至於主持這些學校的人的熱心和毅力，尤其使人欽佩。不過這些學校在設施上也不免有些困難和缺憾，應該要設法補救的。</p>
<p>美國的華僑舉校和國內學校有同樣的缺憾，就是校數太少，華僑子弟不能都有入學的機會。舊金山是華僑教育最發達的地方。華僑所設立的中文學校有九所之多，其中有七所兼有中學班。學生共計有二千多人。據學校中人的估計，當地華僑子弟入美國的學校的，每十人之中有九人同時入中文學校。受中文教育的子弟，如此之多，很可令人滿意。可是除了舊金山以外的其他城市的華僑教育情形，便不能如此令人滿意了。以美國的大城市如支加哥和紐約而論，中國的僑民，不在少數，可是華僑學校只有一兩所。至於其他有華僑居住的小城小鎮，大抵都設有華僑學校。這種情形在現時還不十分嚴重。因為一部分的華僑子弟雖然沒有機會進中文學校受中國教育，可是他們的祖或父，者是從中國來的，或多或少，都受過中國教育，都還保存着本國的成訓，對於他們的子孫還可在家庭裏施行教育，使他們不致忘懷祖國。可是這種情形，如其繼續幾個世代，那麼祖國的意識，必定要逐潮模糊，愛國的情緒，也將逐漸冷淡，而僑民和祖國必將失去還有的可寶貴的聯繋，”。這在祖國和僑民兩方面，都是極大的損失。為了免除這種損失，我們對於華僑子弟不能普遍受中國教育的缺憾，不能不設法彌補。</p>
<p>美國的華僑學校的第二點缺憾，是在課程方面。這些學校幾乎全是依照國內中小學校的普通標準來編記課程的。各種科目總數，雖略有减少，但是所設置的各科的內容，幾乎完全和國內相同。所用的教	科書，也多是國內中小學通用的。這樣辦法，儘量使僑民子弟和國內兒童受同樣教育，似乎是很合於理想的。可是在事實上却有很大的困難。原來這些入華僑學校的兒童，依法律還是要進當地的美國公立學校的。照現在通行的辦法，為求雙方兼顧，他們是日間進美國學校和美國兒童受同樣的教育；晚間進華僑學校受和祖國兒童幾乎完全相同的教育。這樣一來，在這些聰明活潑可愛的華僑兒童的肩上，便加上了雙重的負擔！這種過分的負擔，對於他們的健康和學習的效率，自然不免都有捐傷，這是很嚴重的問題。不但如此，還有些華僑學校，因為依照學生家長的要求，一切教本都採取文言編制的：在普通科目而外，還添上讀經和詩賦等類的功課。這在稚弱的心靈上，又加上重壓。這些僑民異國的家長們，因為眷懷祖國，非把祖國過去文化的精華傳遞他們的子弟，精神上便不能得着慰安。他們的這種心情，是很值得同情和欽佩的。可是他們沒有知道，在他們的子弟的負擔已經過重的肩上，再加上這種連國內子弟都不能勝任愉快的負擔，甚結果不但要損傷了子弟的健康，還反要引起他們對於祖國文化的壓惡。為了减輕華僑子弟的知識的負擔，我們對於這種課程方面的困難，也不能不設法解除。</p>
<p>關於華僑教育不普及，以及課程分量太繁重這兩種困難，記者建議兩種救濟的辦法。</p>
<p>華僑教育的不發達的最大原因，自然在經費和師資的缺乏方面。要擴充華僑教育，固然希望當地的僑胞多多熱心捐欵。可是國內主管華僑教育的機關，也應該加以協助。這種機關，本也有協助欵項的辦法。可是據華僑學校的主持人說，這種協欵本來很少，各校分配下來，每梭所得錢數，折合成美金，實在是微乎其微。這種種協欵的有無，實在是無足輕重。在國內義務教育尚未普及的情形之下，我們當然不能希望政府支撥鉅欵來補助華僑教育。不過政府的帮助，不一定要在經濟方面。僑校最大的支出，在於教師薪金方面，國內與其接濟無足輕重的，少量金錢，莫如供給僑校最感需要的教師。這些敎師如何供給呢？據支加哥中國領事館中的一位朋友說起，他會經向政府上過條陳，請政府規定，凡是公費留學生都有在當地教育華僑子弟的義務。這種辦法，記者覺得是極可採用的。留學生旣受公家的優過，在上課的餘暇，每尾湖油出幾小時來為僑胞服務，這是應該的。並見留學生本負有文化的使命，一面在國外接受外國的交化，一面也把祖國文化在國外散播些種子，正是溝通文化的最有意義的工作。現在美國的大小城市，凡是華僑聚集的地方，大都有公費留學生，政府如果有上述的規定，那麼各地推廣華僑教育，師資問題，便可完全解决，經費問題，也因此解决了一大部分了。這種推廣華僑教育的輕而易舉的辦法，是值得鄭重向國內建議的。</p>
<p>關於僑校的課程，記者建議重行改組，而改組應以簡單化為原則。僑校課程的分科和分量，决不宜與國內中小學相同。科目和時間都應儘量减少。小學部分，至多分國語和社會兩科。國語科純敎白話文，使學生能說國語，能識能寫中國文字。社會科應該混合中國史地公民，和過去有價值的成訓，使兒童對於祖國能有扼要的認識。這兩科每日上課的時間，都不可以過一小時。中學部分的課程，也只應分國語和社會兩科。國語仍以白話文為主，可以酌加文言文以及淺近易解有價值的古文創作。可是文言文以用古文創作，但望學生可以了解和欣賞，却不可賣令寫作。社會科可以酌分中國歷史，中國地理，中國公民，三部分學習，但是仍要求其聯貫。中學的國語和社會，每天上課時間，也都以一小時為限。中小學的國語和社會的敎本，應該特別編輯。選材要力求精要，同時還要切合華僑的需要。這些敎本，最好由敎育部編輯和印行。凡是敎育部立案的華橋學校，都可免費領取這些敎本。無代價的潑給學生。課程和敎本問題，倘能如此解决，我想一面固可减輕學生的負擔，一面還可因此增加華僑敎育的效率，可算是一舉而兩得了</p>
<p>以上這兩項建議，都是簡而易行的。倘得當局採取施行，華僑敎育前途，將有無限的希望</p>

<p>［東京］組織新黨之空氣現已消散、近衛內閣公開表示、無意組織新黨、俾得政民兩黨之擁擠、其左右之從事組織黨者、亦已偃旗息鼓、惟因日本正積極在統制主議下改革其政治經濟機構新政黨之需要、尚未消失、目前政民兩黨、因鑒於國內與國外各情、深感所謂復興政黨必須從本身之改革始、民政黨已開始此種改革、决定在建設新的集權國家之口號下、擬定數項新此策、民政黨自信為非右亦非左之政黨、對其地位認為係屬於中立、其新政綱則稍為改變以自由主義維持現狀主義與資本主義為　導之原則、政友會內之改革運動亦已開始其趨向、大慨與民政黨者無異、日本旣成政黨之被迫改革本身以迎合環境與開發將來、表示在現行局勢上有極大之影響、而各黨繼續右傾之趨勢、尤堪注意也、（十九日中央社電）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談取名</h3>
<p>— 起瀾</p>
<p>據報載：柏林十七日電，德內長佛立克下令禁止兒童取名希特勒後，今日復下令禁止兒童用戈林（普魯士總理），郭培爾（宣傳部長），及德國任何政治要人之名為名，近有一女孩取名希特勒利克，為當局駁絕。</p>
<p>禁止兒童取名希特拉，戈林，戈培爾以及德國任何政治要人的名字，這樣的事不特在德國是僅見，開歷來所未有的先例，就是在歐洲各國也是非常罕見的。可是像這樣的禁令，在中國歷朝可就不同，而且反而是傳統的成例了。不過這些到底長封建時代的產物，一到民國就完全廢棄了的。</p>
<p>取名不特不能與皇帝相同，而且甚至於連皇親國戚的名字也不能與之相抵觸•并且一個字也不准苟同。有時有些大家族，兒孫的名字也常常是不許和祖宗類同的。可是這種大家族的制度，在平民間卻不合用的，阿貓阿狗……這一類的名字非常普遍地流行，不但祖宗呌做阿狗，到了子孫一代也可以呌做阿狗。有時同輩兄弟同名者也常常不在少數。這就是非常顯著的例證。</p>
<p>其實取名的相同，利害的關係是很少的。只是滿腦子里的封建思想的人，一朝大權在手，就以為別人有意估他的光，或者有意冒犯皇上面已。所以無怪乎孫總理名字分明是“孫文”，可是在滿清的統治者的手下，却徧徧把他改成“孫汶”，顯示着他是一個罪犯或逆黨的意思。但是改自由他改，事實上絲毫無害於孫總理在革命上的功績的。</p>
<p>孔夫子有句話，呌做“名不正，則言不順”，意思是說一個人非要正名不可。但是往往名字的正否，却並無害於他的事業。只是人們往往好面子，小時候的名字有點太粗俗，一旦發跡起來，就把阿貓阿狗改換別的雅號，以表示自己並不粗俗，其實於正名是毫無關係的。比如殷汝耕，你能夠說他的名字原來就是漢奸的名字麼？</p>
<p>不過名字到底是難取的，以前監察院有位委員的名字，剛好跟“偽滿的某顯要相同，一相同，自然也就容易引起誤會，不過事實一明白之後，於那位委員依舊是絲毫無損的。所以像希特拉這一類名字，在德國經過禁止他人取用，可是萬一他國人取用了，他依然是無權利制止的。但是話又得說轉來，恐怕這幾個兇惡的獨裁者的名字，有正義感的人正厭惡得很，大約也不會替孩子們取用的吧？</p>
<h3>蠻荒旅行記</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>法國女新聞家浦維約陀，與她的女同志𡩳諾尼斯，一九三四年曾赤足坐在駱駝背上，游歷法屬西非的蠻荒區域。浦女士近把她的冒險事績，寫成了一書勇敢女子，在旅途中經歷蠻野人民的生讀者閱讀了訂浦女士所著的書，都要覺得驚心動魄，欽佩她們兩位的冒險精神</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>並且由此可知今日的世界，雖然四通八達，旅行家並無什麼異跡可以發見，但是游踪所至，依然會遇到羅曼斯的。</p>
<p>浦女士在她書中告诉我們，气概高贵的酋王，用手把羊肉與米飯搓成一團，塞入嘴裏，等到晚宴完畢，瞧瞧他沾滿了油脂的兩手，便用刀把手上的油脂刮下擦在脚上，這是茅里太尼亞蠻人的禮節。女士又說及她們的游行，並無目的，經過了許多艱難困苦，夜間在骯髒的摩爾人棚帳裏過宿，日間常常不能得到食物，隔許多小時，才有物止飢，有水止渴，可是都骯髒萬分，在文明的都市中沒有一人敢嚐一點兒的。至於沙漠地方，置身其間，自然覺得枯燥無味，可是那赤黃色的沙丘，處處隆起，那星光下的夜景，悲涼雄壯，也別有一種悅目怡情的美點，而那惡狠狠部落人民，在起伏的沙丘上用沙代水，摩擦面部，作為應有的凈身，對他們敎主穆哈默德行讚禮的當兒，那一種古樸的神態，也是別處所不能見到的。</p>
<p>她們兩位同乘了一隻小漁船，離開法國，夜間睡在魚網之上，用一隻盛炭化鈣的箱子，當牀邊的小案。航行了十三天，才瞭見茅里太尼亞平坦荒蕪寂寞的海濱，她們正要登岸的當兒，那游牧之民用槍彈作他們的歡迎物。她們後來在愛蒂安港下船，開始在游牧民衆中度那蠻野的生活。她們又從這港航行到美姆爾哈，便跟怪異的族類同住在海濱棚帳裏，在十天之內，她們居然學會飮七製的綠茶四杯，這是土人待客的敬禮。她們的充飢物是用手搓成的米飯牛羊肉跟沙混合的團子。</p>
<p>她們於是僱了駱駝數頭，覓了一個强壯的土人作嚮導，換了沙漠居民的服裝，沿着旅行隊的途徑，向內地進發•這時皮鞋也脫去了，頭上的遮陽帽換了土人的纏頭布。她們漫遊茅里太尼亞境內的各地。從金黃色的土人，到黑檀色土人住的地方，都有她們的足跡。她們首先跟摩爾人共同起居，因此熟悉這些土人的習慣性情。摩爾人的母牛，倘若沒有公牛在旁，是不肯給人擠乳的。她們看見摩爾的賣淫婦，一雙眼睛上畫一個紅圈，另一雙眼睛上畫一個藍圈，額角上還寫上經文，兩頰却晝些花兒，髮上塗滿了牛酪。她們看見土人奇怪的跳舞，或食物的槃子，用牲畜的乾糞擦凈。她們大膽地合土人廝混，才得到這些經騐，她們夜裏受各種蟲虱的侵擾。</p>
<p>土人家庭的習慣，尤為奇異。男子在生客面前不敢對他的妻妾表示熱情，在他的長輩面前，甚至不敢跟兒女談話嬉弄。一夜浦女士被一個女兒的哭聲吵醒，她便起身查問原因，知道啼哭的是酋長的女兒，名呌陀陀、陀陀已到了結婚的年齡，她的監護人正在逼她進食，因為監護人負着使她肥胖，以便出嫁的責任，所以除去日間所吃的東西不算，每晚睡後到清晨之間，逼她飲牛乳五革囊，其實她的身量已長得很肥大了。監護人並須替她理髪修面，捉身上的虱子，替她戴結婚的面巾，跟寶石的飾品。更可怪的，還須把她的門牙㧞去，使她的牙齒有一個隔一個的缺洞，這是土人的風俗、然後把她送到結婚的棚帳裏，但在結婚的第一年，每夜雖須跟丈夫在一處，天明之前，必須回到她父母的棚帳裏。土人的一夫多妻制，也很奇怪。她們名義上是一夫一妻，不過女子與丈夫同居了數年，便帶了相當數目的駱駝，回到他的爸爸處，再由爸爸替她覓一新丈夫。那丈夫也另娶一個女子為妻，所生的兒女，却歸丈夫撫養。</p>
<p>浦女士與她同伴所遇的最難問題之一，便是飲食。她們居然也吃慣了令人作嘔的餐品，但有一次前往訪問沙漢的首領的當兒，他拿出敬客的美品，却不能下咽。那是一個大羊肚，由奴隸把其中的污穢擠空，然後塞滿了肉食與脂肪，拌黍煮熟，再塗上惡臭的生酪和石鹽，放在一個大瓢裏，端到面前，那飄在不進食的時候，用它盛燃料裝牛乳，洗臉，還供歐洲游客洗脚之用，但在盛食物之前，奴隸却用他的衣服下半截把它謹愼地擦乾凈，浦女士說：“倘若你能吃這個美味的話，也許會發見沒有弄凈的羊屎豆”。</p>
<p>這些土人的生活，似乎又回到舊約中所說的時代。浦女士曾見到他們奇異的性情，據她的觀察，摩爾人秉性狡猾，兩眼凶光暴露，待人却能諂媚。其中有奴族，雜種，還有黃褐色或黑色的佩爾婦女。佩爾人差不多全靠牛乳生活。浦女士一次大姆指上曾中一刺，致發生血毒，她的同伴在駱駝進槽的當兒，曾由牠背上墜地，致扭傷了頸𩓐子，這是她們旅途中的不幸遭遇。她們雖漫遊了多時，但因此縮短了豫定的期限，後來行到某法地方的法兵哨營，才得到潔凈的牀位，那時的快樂，非筆墨所能寫出的。</p>

<h3>My Attitude Towards Japan Is Neither Softened Nor Hardened</h3>
<p>Diplomatic Policy Remains Consistent　Resistance Will Erupt If Invaded　If Political Issues Are Left Unresolved　Other Negotiations Will Not Yield Good Results　Foreign Minister Wang's Words to Japanese Reporters</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to news, Foreign Minister Wang met with resident Japanese reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4 PM on the 18th of this month, including Hashimoto and Yamamoto from the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, Shimura from the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, Ureshino from the Yomiuri Shimbun, and Okumiya from the Domei News Agency, totaling five people. The reporters inquired about Sino-Japanese relations, and Minister Wang frankly replied, stating that improving Sino-Japanese relations has always been his aspiration. However, the integrity of the relationship between the two countries depends on the joint efforts of both sides. He has great expectations for Ambassador Kawagoe. If the new instructions brought back by Ambassador Kawagoe are indeed based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, then the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations should be easily realized in the short term. As for the steps for adjustment, it is advisable to start with easier issues first, he said. The conversation lasted about 30 minutes, and the Japanese reporters all expressed satisfaction. The main points of the questions and answers during the conversation are as follows: (Question) What are your impressions of the Konoe Cabinet? (Answer) As far as we know, Prime Minister Konoe is a leader whom the Japanese people widely admire, familiar with the domestic and international situation, and deeply loved and respected by all sectors. His formation of a cabinet this time will surely bring great plans and strategies to satisfy the expectations of people at home and abroad. The statements made by Mr. Konoe as reported in the press, such as advocating the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, should first eliminate any suspicion, hostility, and misunderstanding between the Chinese and Japanese governments and people, promoting sympathy and practical assistance for the Chinese in building a new China, are all accurate and immutable arguments. We deeply hope that he will overcome all difficulties and earnestly implement these principles, so that Sino-Japanese relations can fully return to normal, and East Asian peace and practical benefits will rely on it. (Question) What are your opinions on Foreign Minister Hirota's diplomacy towards China? (Answer) Mr. Hirota is a respected senior diplomat, and his name is well-known to the Chinese people. We still vividly remember his speech on January 23, 1935, regarding non-aggression, non-threat, and good neighborliness towards China, seeking closer relations with China, and we deeply hope that it can be realized soon. Over the past year, the situation in East Asia has changed significantly. We especially hope that he can take the spirit of the new era and the principle of equality and mutual benefit to open a new chapter in Sino-Japanese relations. (Question) Kawagoe is about to return to his post. Is the Chinese side prepared to start negotiations to adjust Sino-Japanese relations after Ambassador Kawagoe returns to his post? If so, what is the fundamental policy of the Chinese side? (Answer) China's diplomatic policy has already been declared in the declaration of the Third Plenary Session and when I took office. I am ready to exchange views with the Japanese side at any time. After Ambassador Kawagoe returns to his post, I am very willing to listen to his opinions. (Question) It is said that since the Sino-Japanese negotiations last year, China's attitude towards Japan has hardened. Is this true? (Answer) China's diplomatic policy is consistent, and its purpose is to seek self-preservation and coexistence. There is no such thing as softening or hardening. (Question) If the adjustment of political relations is not possible, will the policy of rejecting economic cooperation be maintained? (Answer) Regarding opening up Sino-Japanese relations, our side does not specify which issue should be the prerequisite, but in fact, all issues between China and Japan are related to political issues. If political issues are left unresolved on the one hand, and other issues are pursued on the other hand, it may be difficult to achieve good results. This is a practical situation, not a theoretical issue. (Question) What is the policy of the National Government on political and economic issues in North China? If problems such as smuggling in eastern Hebei are not resolved, is Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China impossible? If these issues are resolved, is there an expectation of resolving other outstanding issues and restoring normal relations between the two countries? (Answer) If problems such as smuggling in eastern Hebei are not resolved for one day, the administration of politics and economy in North China will not be complete for one day.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Volunteers in Chahar-Suiyuan Region Establish Contact</h3>
<p>Clash Occurred Near Chongli　A Platoon of Bandits and Puppet Li's Troops Captured</p>
<p>[Tianjin] According to news from Jining, the anti-Japanese volunteer troops led by Zhang Chengde and Li Tingyuan between Huade, Chongli, and Shangwen have established contact. The troops of the puppet Li Shouxin are surrounded and are gradually concentrating towards Zhangbei. A clash occurred near Chongli on the morning of the 17th, and a platoon of Li Shouxin's troops was captured.

<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Konoe is paying close attention to the various situations in North China, the Soviet Union, and Manchuria, as well as the development of general foreign affairs issues, and is carefully considering solutions. Today, on the morning of the 19th, he invited Army Minister Sugiyama to his official residence to listen to detailed explanations on the recent situation in North China and the Five-Year Plan for Manchurian Industry, exchanging views for more than an hour. The Prime Minister also went to Hakone in the afternoon of the same day for a week's rest, staying at the Fujiya Hotel in Miyashita, and scheduled to invite Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi on the 20th to listen to general foreign affairs issues.</p>
<p>Army Minister Sugiyama told people after meeting with Prime Minister Konoe as follows: The Prime Minister said that he wanted to hear about the situation in Manchuria and North China because there was not enough time to explain in detail at the cabinet meeting. Therefore, he was able to talk about the general situation today. The Manchurian issue alone took more than an hour, and he was not able to explain the details. As for the meeting with General Minami, it was a cordial discussion on the situation of governing Korea and other matters.</p>
<p>Since taking office, Foreign Minister Hirota has hoped to implement smooth diplomacy. Regarding the policy towards China, he has established close contact with the army and navy authorities and plans to convene a three-ministry meeting soon.

<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese financial officer stationed in Shanghai was discontinued after the September 18th Incident. Now the Ministry of Finance has decided to resume this system from September this year. In the past five or six years, Japan only had one secretary stationed in Shanghai to collect materials. Last month, the Bank of Japan sent Hisataka Munakata, the director of the National Debt Bureau, to China for inspection. In his report, he strongly advocated that the Bank of Japan should also send personnel to station in Shanghai. This proposal has been adopted by the bank authorities, and the bank's representative will be dispatched to China in September or October. It is heard that the adoption of this measure is due to the following reasons: the financial, economic, and monetary information obtained by Japan in China lacks unity, which easily leads to serious errors in Japan's understanding of China. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan have decided to send representatives to station in Shanghai permanently to eliminate this defect and obtain accurate information.

<p>(Continued from Page 3: Foreign Minister Wang's Remarks)</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, any new political or economic measures may not be easily effective. If these issues can be satisfactorily resolved, relations between the two countries should not be difficult to return to normal, and other outstanding cases can be easily solved. (Question) Recently, the Chinese side has been vigorously promoting the spirit of resistance against Japan. This kind of talk, which provokes Chinese people's resentment towards Japan, not only induces ominous incidents everywhere but also has a great stimulation on the Japanese people. Does this seem contrary to Minister Wang's so-called "harmonizing national sentiment"? What is your opinion? (Answer) "Harmonizing national sentiment" is indeed important, but it requires simultaneous efforts from both countries and cannot be the sole responsibility of one side. As far as I know, China has not been advocating anti-Japanese sentiments recently, but if there are any aggressors, no matter which country, our people will surely rise up and advocate resistance. (Question) Are Sino-British negotiations in progress, and to what extent? (Answer) The current relationship between China and Britain is as before, handling ordinary matters through normal diplomatic channels. (Question) What is China's attitude towards Anglo-Japanese negotiations? (Answer) The scope of Anglo-Japanese negotiations is presumably very broad and is not limited to Chinese issues. However, any understanding, if it involves China, must first respect China's territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity, and second, consult with China and obtain China's consent. I deeply believe that the negotiators on both sides must have the same view as us. (Question) Regarding the issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction, are there plans to begin negotiations with the relevant countries in the near future? What is the truth? (Answer) Abolishing consular jurisdiction is a consistent policy of the Kuomintang, and the government is prepared to proceed at any time. It is currently still under study and preparation. (Question) Are negotiations for a Sino-Soviet commercial treaty currently in progress? (Answer) The Sino-Russian commercial treaty is like China's commercial treaties with other foreign countries and can be discussed at any time. (Question) It is heard that preparations for the centralization of North China are steadily progressing. Has sufficient consideration been given to Japan's position in North China in this regard? (Answer) The northern provinces, like other provinces, are part of China's territory, and national laws should be implemented in the northern provinces as well. This is a natural phenomenon in a modern unified country and is not surprising. As for the legitimate rights and interests of all countries in China, they should be respected. (Question) What are your expectations for Japan? (Answer) I hope that Japan will respect China's territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity and, based on the spirit of equality and mutual benefit, adjust Sino-Japanese relations through diplomatic channels. (Question) Is the world situation heading towards peace or war? I would like to hear your opinion. (Answer) Currently, there are clearly two forces in the world: one force is working to maintain peace, and another force, unknowingly, could contribute to future wars. The waxing and waning of these two forces will determine the fate of world peace or war. The Chinese people have always loved peace and deeply hope that the forces that maintain peace can overcome everything for the sake of world culture and human happiness. (Question) For the work of Far Eastern peace, do you think it is necessary to convene a special conference? (Answer) If all the countries concerned can participate in such a conference, cooperate sincerely, and discuss everything, it will indeed benefit Far Eastern peace. (Question) It is reported that the Australian Prime Minister has proposed a non-aggression treaty for Pacific countries at the British Imperial Conference. What are your thoughts, Minister? (Answer) The Australian Prime Minister's proposal seems worthy of our study, but its content has not yet been read. (Question) The foundation of Japan's policy towards China lies in free and satisfactory trade of economic raw materials and products. What are the strategies regarding this issue? (Answer) China is very willing to have mutually beneficial economic cooperation with Japan due to various geographical and cultural reasons. As long as the current political obstacles are removed, this cooperation will not be difficult to achieve. (Question) According to recent intelligence from various places, the tension in the relationship between the Chinese and Japanese people in China (especially in North China) is increasing. If this is allowed to continue, the result is tantamount to waiting for a crisis. What do you think? (Answer) The information may be somewhat exaggerated, but conflicts in the feelings of the two countries' people should indeed be avoided. I hope that both countries will make joint efforts, especially to find ways to remove the obstacles to restoring feelings. (Question) What are Minister Wang's ambitions for opening up Sino-Japanese relations? (Answer) Improving Sino-Japanese relations has been my long-held wish. Years ago, when I did not hold any diplomatic responsibilities, I did my best in this regard. Now that I am in charge of foreign affairs, I will naturally do my best to implement this wish. However, the adjustment of relations between the two countries still requires the joint efforts of both sides. (Question) According to the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session, the North China political issue must be resolved in a short period. Does your country have an active intention to start negotiations with Japan on this matter, or are you waiting for the time to ripen and taking a wait-and-see attitude for the time being? (Answer) The so-called North China political issue, no matter what method is used to deal with it, only requires Japan to have the determination to untie the knot, and the solution is very easy. (Question) Ambassador Kawagoe will return to Nanjing from Japan around late June, carrying a new policy towards China based on equality and mutual benefit. What are your expectations and thoughts on this, Minister? (Answer) I have great expectations for Ambassador Kawagoe. If the new instructions that Ambassador Kawagoe brings back are indeed based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, then I deeply believe that the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations can be achieved in a short period. (Question) Is there a way to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations? If so, what kind of method will it be? Specifically, how can this deadlock be broken? (Answer) I believe that breaking the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations is not difficult. It only requires both sides to respect each other's territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity and strictly maintain the spirit of equality and mutual benefit in negotiations. It is not difficult to break the deadlock. As for the steps, I think it is better to start with easier issues first and then proceed to resolve more difficult issues. (Question) It is heard that the Chinese side insists on the cancellation of eastern Hebei as an absolute condition for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. Is this true? (Answer) Our side has not specified any issue as an absolute prerequisite for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, but the existence of the puppet organization in eastern Hebei is detrimental to China and does not benefit Japan. It is a very simple and easy issue to resolve. If such a simple issue cannot be satisfactorily resolved, other more complex issues will naturally be even more difficult to address. This is a very obvious truth. (Question) No matter how much the tax police corps is expanded and strengthened, before Sino-Japanese relations are normalized, the thorough suppression of smuggling will not only be impossible but will also risk causing unforeseen events between China and Japan. Does the Chinese side have any intention of reducing tariffs? (Answer) Smuggling not only reduces China's tax revenue but also affects Chinese and foreign businesses. Even legitimate Japanese merchants are harmed by it. The Chinese government's use of appropriate force to prevent smuggling is a matter of course. We sincerely cannot imagine that it will cause any unforeseen events. As for import tax rates, any country can consider the situation and adjust them automatically at any time, but illegal merchants cannot use smuggling as a threat to demand tax reductions. (Question) What does Minister Wang hope for from our (Japanese) people? (Answer) I hope that the general Japanese public can have a correct understanding of the new China and gain a correct understanding of the crux of the disputes between China and Japan over the years. I also hope that the Japanese press will avoid inflammatory remarks and create a friendly atmosphere. If this is achieved, the work of the diplomatic authorities of the two countries in adjusting relations will be greatly reduced. (Central News Agency, 19th)</p>

<h3>Some Suggestions Regarding Overseas Chinese Education</h3>
<p>— Wu Junsheng</p>
<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to investigate education in the United States, and I also visited and surveyed many overseas Chinese schools established in the United States. At that time, I deeply felt the importance of overseas Chinese education, and at the same time, I also discovered many areas that should be improved. Now, I would like to suggest a few points for the reference of those who are concerned about overseas Chinese education.</p>
<p>The importance of overseas Chinese education is self-evident. In the past, the contributions of overseas Chinese to the motherland cannot be attributed in part to overseas Chinese education. In the future, to maintain the connection between overseas compatriots and the motherland, we must pay attention to overseas Chinese education. According to the laws of some countries (such as the United States), native-born children belong to the nationality of the country where they are located. This provision of status can easily make native-born children forget their motherland. But until now, the sense of motherland of the general overseas Chinese children is still very strong, and the patriotic sentiment is still very enthusiastic. This cannot but be attributed to overseas Chinese schools: because overseas Chinese schools teach the language, writing, history, and geography of the motherland, they have not forgotten their motherland to this day, and their patriotic expression is sometimes more enthusiastic than their compatriots in the country. Judging from the many overseas Chinese schools that I saw in the United States, they are generally satisfactory. The enthusiasm and perseverance of the people who run these schools are especially admirable. However, these schools inevitably have some difficulties and shortcomings in their facilities, which should be remedied.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese schools in the United States have the same shortcomings as domestic schools, that is, there are too few schools, and not all overseas Chinese children can have the opportunity to attend school. San Francisco is the most developed place for overseas Chinese education. There are as many as nine Chinese schools established by overseas Chinese, seven of which also have middle school classes. There are more than 2,000 students in total. According to estimates from people in the schools, for every ten overseas Chinese children who attend American schools in the area, nine of them also attend Chinese schools. The number of children receiving Chinese education is so large that it is very gratifying. However, the situation of overseas Chinese education in other cities besides San Francisco is not so gratifying. Taking major cities in the United States such as Chicago and New York, the number of Chinese expatriates is not small, but there are only one or two overseas Chinese schools. As for other small cities and towns where overseas Chinese reside, most of them have overseas Chinese schools. This situation is not very serious at present. Because although some overseas Chinese children do not have the opportunity to attend Chinese schools and receive Chinese education, their ancestors or fathers either came from China or have received Chinese education to varying degrees, and they still retain the teachings of their home country, and they can still educate their children in their families so that they will not forget their motherland. However, if this situation continues for several generations, then the sense of motherland will inevitably gradually blur, and the patriotic sentiment will gradually cool down, and the valuable connection between overseas Chinese and the motherland will be lost. This is a great loss for both the motherland and overseas Chinese. In order to avoid this loss, we must try to make up for the shortcoming that overseas Chinese children cannot receive Chinese education universally.</p>
<p>The second shortcoming of overseas Chinese schools in the United States is in terms of curriculum. These schools almost all compile courses according to the ordinary standards of primary and secondary schools in China. Although the total number of subjects has been slightly reduced, the content of each subject set is almost completely the same as in China. The textbooks used are also mostly those commonly used in primary and secondary schools in China. This approach, which tries to enable overseas Chinese children to receive the same education as domestic children, seems to be in line with the ideal. But in fact, there are great difficulties. Originally, these children who enter overseas Chinese schools are still required to attend local American public schools according to the law. According to the current practice, in order to take care of both sides, they attend American schools during the day and receive the same education as American children; in the evening, they attend overseas Chinese schools and receive almost exactly the same education as children in their motherland. As a result, a double burden is added to the shoulders of these smart, lively, and lovely overseas Chinese children! This excessive burden will inevitably damage their health and learning efficiency, which is a very serious problem. Not only that, but some overseas Chinese schools, because they follow the requirements of students' parents, adopt classical Chinese for all teaching materials: in addition to ordinary subjects, they also add homework such as reading scriptures and writing poetry. This adds even more pressure to their weak minds. Because they care about their motherland, these overseas parents cannot feel at ease unless they pass on the essence of the past culture of their motherland to their children. Their feelings are very worthy of sympathy and admiration. However, they do not know that adding this kind of burden to the already overloaded shoulders of their children, a burden that even children in China cannot bear, will not only damage the health of the children but will also arouse their resentment towards the culture of their motherland. In order to reduce the burden of knowledge on overseas Chinese children, we must also find ways to alleviate this kind of curriculum difficulty.</p>
<p>Regarding the two difficulties of the unpopularity of overseas Chinese education and the excessive amount of curriculum, I suggest two remedies.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the underdevelopment of overseas Chinese education is naturally the lack of funding and teachers. To expand overseas Chinese education, we certainly hope that local overseas Chinese will be more enthusiastic about donating money. However, the domestic authorities in charge of overseas Chinese education should also assist. This kind of agency also has ways to assist funds. However, according to the principals of overseas Chinese schools, this kind of assistance is originally very small, and the amount of money allocated to each school, converted into US dollars, is really negligible. The existence or absence of this kind of assistance is really insignificant. In the situation where compulsory education in China has not yet been popularized, we certainly cannot expect the government to allocate huge sums of money to subsidize overseas Chinese education. However, government assistance does not necessarily have to be in the economic aspect. The biggest expenditure of overseas Chinese schools is in the aspect of teachers' salaries. Instead of providing insignificant small amounts of money, it is better for the country to provide overseas Chinese schools with the teachers they need most. How should these teachers be supplied? According to a friend in the Chinese Consulate in Chicago, he once submitted a memorial to the government, requesting the government to stipulate that all publicly funded students should have the obligation to educate overseas Chinese children locally. I think this method is very adoptable. Students who are publicly funded have received preferential treatment from the public. In their spare time from class, they should spare a few hours each week to serve overseas Chinese. This is their duty. Moreover, students have a cultural mission. On the one hand, they accept foreign cultures abroad, and on the other hand, they also spread some seeds of Chinese culture abroad. It is precisely the most meaningful work of cultural communication. Now, in the large and small cities of the United States, wherever overseas Chinese gather, there are mostly publicly funded students. If the government has the above-mentioned regulations, then the problem of teachers for promoting overseas Chinese education in various places can be completely solved, and the problem of funding can also be solved to a large extent. This easy way to promote overseas Chinese education is worth seriously recommending to the country.</p>
<p>Regarding the curriculum of overseas Chinese schools, I suggest that it be reorganized, and the reorganization should be based on simplification. The subjects and amount of curriculum in overseas Chinese schools should definitely not be the same as those in domestic primary and secondary schools. The number of subjects and time should be reduced as much as possible. In the primary school section, there should be at most two subjects: national language and society. The national language course purely teaches vernacular Chinese, so that students can speak the national language and can recognize and write Chinese characters. The social studies course should mix Chinese history, geography, civics, and valuable past teachings, so that children can have a concise understanding of their motherland. The class time for both subjects should not exceed one hour per day. The curriculum in the middle school section should also only be divided into two subjects: national language and society. The national language is still mainly vernacular Chinese, and classical Chinese and easily understood and valuable ancient prose creations can be added appropriately. However, classical Chinese is used to create ancient prose, but it is hoped that students can understand and appreciate it, but they should not be forced to write it. The social studies course can be divided into three parts for learning: Chinese history, Chinese geography, and Chinese civics, but it is still required to be continuous. The class time for national language and society in middle school should also be limited to one hour per day. Special textbooks should be edited for national language and social studies in primary and secondary schools. The selection of materials should be as concise as possible, and it should also be tailored to the needs of overseas Chinese. These textbooks are best edited and printed by the Ministry of Education. All overseas Chinese schools registered with the Ministry of Education can receive these textbooks free of charge. Give it to students at no cost. If the problems of curriculum and textbooks can be solved in this way, I think that on the one hand, the burden on students can be reduced, and on the other hand, the efficiency of overseas Chinese education can be increased. It can be regarded as killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>The above two suggestions are simple and easy to implement. If the authorities adopt and implement them, the future of overseas Chinese education will have unlimited hope.</p>
<h3>Japanese Representative Requests Development of Raw Materials in Other Countries</h3>
<p>South American Representatives Raise Questions, Believing It Harms Territorial Sovereignty</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Raw Materials Committee established by the Council of the League of Nations continued its meeting today. The Japanese representative, Shutō, spoke first, arguing that countries that do not produce raw materials should have the right to develop raw materials buried in undeveloped areas, and cited the League of Nations' current mandate system as supporting evidence. The Brazilian representative, Muniz, questioned Shutō, asking whether the United States or Brazil were countries that contained raw materials that had not been developed according to Shutō's meaning. Shutō replied that he did not mean that. The Argentine representative, Antokoletz, also said that he hoped that Shutō's meaning was not referring to any country in South America. Thereupon, the committee organized a special subcommittee composed of representatives from Japan, Brazil, Poland, and the United Kingdom to draft a report on the Japanese representative's proposal. Muniz then declared, "The principle put forward by Shutō can only be applied to colonies, not to any country with complete territorial sovereignty. Therefore, Shutō should be asked to specify the general meaning of his claim." Sir Leeds Ross, the British representative, continued, "The Raw Materials Committee should only deal with the redistribution of raw materials and should not involve territorial issues." Muniz then said that some countries' views on the raw materials issue were too narrow, and this tendency might cause serious repercussions for Latin American countries.

<h3>Weng Wenhao Gives a Speech in Germany</h3>
<p>Welcoming Foreign Investment and Talent</p>
<p>[Berlin] At the invitation of the Sinological Research Association, Weng Wenhao, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan of China, gave a speech yesterday at the Dresdner Bank here on the development of China's industry and its relationship with the development of rich resources. The audience included numerous officials from the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Economy, various departments, the National Bank, and the National Socialist Party. Weng declared that the work of developing China's mines had just begun and that significant progress could be expected within a few years. The method of "spheres of influence" in the past is no longer politically possible today. The current Chinese government's mining law has proven to be extremely successful in terms of Chinese and foreign perspectives and interests. Weng listed several examples to illustrate this point, and then stated that China is now willing to cooperate with foreign countries and welcomes the assistance of foreign capital and technical personnel in organizing personnel. China has made amazing progress in technology in recent years, and domestic engineers are even better than foreign engineers, but China still feels that it lacks experience in the development of modern engineering and is willing to cooperate with friendly countries to make progress. Weng pointed out that the basic condition for all cooperation is that foreign groups must respect China's sovereignty. China hopes to cooperate with any foreign country that accepts this condition.

<h3>Three Soviet Aviators Fly Over the North Pole to the United States</h3>
<p>Non-Stop Flight Progressing Smoothly; Fundraising for Moscow-San Francisco Route</p>
<p>[San Francisco] Three Soviet aviators are planning to fly a red-gray monoplane from Moscow over the North Pole to San Francisco (6,250 miles). They flew over the North Pole at 1:10 PM yesterday (Shanghai time) and were near the northern border of Canada this morning. According to an announcement by the U.S. Army Department at 3:20 PM yesterday, the Soviet plane was 550 miles from the North Pole. Officials at the Walker Wren Air Harbor in San Francisco have begun preparations for the welcoming ceremony. As for the route of the Soviet plane, after passing the North Pole, they will first head to Prince Patrick Island, then take the route through Simpson Fortress in Canada, and enter Seattle, Washington in the United States. However, they must fly over the treacherous Rocky Mountains to reach San Francisco along the Pacific coast. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The authorities did not announce that a Soviet plane was flying from Moscow to San Francisco until 24 hours after the plane had departed. They stated that three famous aviation heroes were undertaking this feat. Eighteen and a half hours after departure, they had already flown over the North Pole. It is expected that if this flight is successful, an observatory will be established in the Arctic and an aviation base will be established on Prince Rupert Island. Within two years, a regular air route from Moscow to the United States via the North Pole can be established. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] At 10:20 AM this morning (Greenwich Mean Time), the Soviet plane had flown 400 miles into the Americas. It is reported that the weather conditions along the planned route over northern Canada are extremely favorable. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Troianovsky, arrived here quietly today and stated that Soviet aviator Chkalov, along with Belyakov and pilot Belyakov, had flown from Moscow via the North Pole to the United States and are expected to arrive here on Sunday. He also said that the single-engine aircraft used this time is the same as the one used by Levanevsky two years ago when he tried to fly the same route, but Levanevsky was forced to fly back due to a broken oil pipe. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] According to Gilmore (who was ordered to inspect the various instruments on the Soviet plane when it arrives in San Francisco), he has received information that the Soviet plane will arrive in San Francisco at 2:00 PM tomorrow (Greenwich Mean Time). (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The non-stop long-distance flight from Moscow via the North Pole to North America departed from here at 4:05 AM on the 18th. The aircraft used was the Ant-25, piloted by Soviet aviators Chkalov, Belyakov, and Belyakov. They volunteered for this test flight, which was approved by the government. A special committee was formed to prepare for the flight, consisting of Heavy Industry Commissioner Rukhimovich, Deputy Commissioner Kaganovich, aircraft designer Tupolev, Deputy Defense Commissioner Yaknis, and Deputy Director of the Northern Sea Route Administration, Jansen. Before reaching 65 degrees North latitude, the plane flew at an altitude of 1,150 to 1,430 meters. Between 65 and 68 degrees, it ascended to 2,500 meters. At 12:32 PM, it crossed 68 degrees. At 4:32 PM, it reached 72 degrees 7 minutes North latitude at an altitude of 2,600 meters. Thick clouds covered the sea and the temperature reached -10 degrees Celsius. Until then, the plane had been flying straight along 38 degrees East longitude. At 8:13 PM, when it reached 78 degrees 10 minutes North latitude and 91 degrees East longitude, it switched to complete blind flight and ascended to 4,080 meters. There was slight icing on the plane. At 10:00 PM, it approached Franz Josef Land. The mechanical operations were excellent. (19th, TASS)</p>
<h3>Purge Movement in Soviet Russia: Arrests Continue Across Regions</h3>
<p>Accusations Arriving Like Snowflakes; Sabotage of Railways and Manipulation of Bread Supplies</p>
<p>⊙Riga According to Moscow sources, Stalin's purge movement is still ongoing. Recently, many more people have been arrested, and telegrams from all over the Soviet Union condemning Trotsky's destructive conspiracy and separatism are arriving like snowflakes. It is also reported that among those recently arrested are seven suspects for sabotaging locomotives and two high-ranking officials from the Archangel region, charged as enemies of the people. The former director of the Far East Timber Company in Khabarovsk, Geberk, was charged with engaging in counter-revolutionary activities and inciting popular discontent. Vasilyev and several of his subordinates were arrested for repeated dereliction of duty in failing to provide facilities for 5,000 expatriate families. Eight people were also arrested in Rostov, charged with purchasing large quantities of bread for speculation. In the same city, five officials and numerous staff members were arrested on charges of espionage. Many people have also been arrested in the Omsk railway works. It is said that more people will continue to be arrested in the future. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Belgian Prime Minister Arrives in New York</h3>
<p>To Visit Roosevelt</p>
<p>[New York] Belgian Prime Minister Paul van Zeeland and his wife arrived here today aboard the Berengaria. In a statement to the press, he said, "I am very happy to revisit the United States and to meet with President Roosevelt and his advisors. Compared to Europe, the economic recovery in the United States is very rapid, which is beyond the reach of European countries. However, there is a growing desire among Europeans to develop various businesses in the most realistic and generous way. I dare to believe that this desire is completely in line with the views of the American people. Moreover, the tendency to coordinate the efforts of various countries to promote the smooth development of the general situation has already emerged. It is not far from now to take a further step to concretize this tendency, because this coordinated tendency can improve the common living standards of mankind, which is the common desire of people all over the world." When reporters asked if his visit to the United States was due to a commission from the U.S. and French governments to investigate the possibility of removing international trade barriers, Prime Minister van Zeeland replied, "I was indeed entrusted by the British and French governments, but the tasks entrusted to me are completely different from my visit to the United States today and should not be confused."

<h3>Japanese Political Parties</h3>
<p>The Seiyukai and Minseito Engage in Reform</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The atmosphere of forming a new party has now dissipated. The Konoe Cabinet has publicly stated that it has no intention of forming a new party to gain the support of the Seiyukai and Minseito. Those engaged in organizing the party on the left and right have also ceased their activities. However, because Japan is actively reforming its political and economic structure under a controlled system, the need for a new political party has not disappeared. Currently, the Seiyukai and Minseito, in view of the domestic and international situations, deeply feel that the so-called revival of political parties must begin with their own reform. The Minseito has begun this reform and decided to formulate several new policies under the slogan of building a new centralized state. The Minseito is confident that it is neither a right-wing nor a left-wing party and considers its position to be neutral. Its new political platform will be slightly changed to use liberalism, maintaining the status quo, and capitalism as guiding principles. The reform movement within the Seiyukai has also begun, and its trend is probably no different from that of the Minseito. The forced reform of existing political parties in Japan to adapt to the environment and develop the future indicates a great influence on the current situation, and the continued rightward trend of the parties is particularly noteworthy.

<h3>Japanese Excess of 40 Million Yen</h3>
<p>In the Second Ten Days of This Month</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Ministry of Finance announced the preliminary figures for Japan's foreign trade in the second ten days of June as follows (all figures in units of 1,000 yen):</p>
<p>Exports: 87,491</p>
<p>Imports: 127,507</p>
<p>Total: 215,000</p>
<p>Trade Deficit: 40,081</p>
<p>The total trade deficit since January is 624,919. (19th, Domei)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Both exports and imports continued to decline in the second ten days of June. Exports decreased by 1,597,700 yen compared to the first ten days, and imports also decreased by 7,786,600 yen. However, the total trade deficit still reached 40 million yen, so the cumulative trade deficit this year has reached 624 million yen, which is more than double that of the same period last year. It can be said to be an unprecedented record. Although exports have been very strong since January, there is still a huge trade deficit, which far exceeds the increase in exports, but this is due to the vigorous economy, especially the expansion of production, so a large number of materials and machinery are imported, which is the reason. It should not become any pessimistic material. (19th, Domei)</p>
<h3>French Full Powers Bill</h3>
<p>Senate Committee Overturns</p>
<p>[Paris] The Senate Finance Committee met today to examine the Full Powers Bill and passed a new draft law, which in effect completely overturned the Full Powers Bill passed by the House of Representatives on the 16th of this month. Therefore, after the political turmoil has just subsided, it will once again cause disputes due to the attitude of the Senate. When the Senate Finance Committee met today, Premier Blum and Finance Minister Auriol did not attend, but Auriol sent a letter to the Senate Finance Committee rapporteur Garde, asking the committee to pay attention and make a decision as soon as possible, saying that under the current circumstances, the government should not only stop speculative manipulation, but also try to prevent French capital from fleeing abroad. It is estimated that over the past two years, five or six million francs of French funds have flowed out of the country. These outflows of capital are all evading their responsibility to the country. It is imperative to make them flow back into the country. In the final part of the Finance Minister's letter, he said that the government could not submit any new bill to the Finance Committee that would impose too many restrictions on the government's actions, so he hoped that the Finance Committee would approve the law passed by the House of Representatives as soon as possible. However, after the Finance Committee met and discussed, it still insisted on drafting a new bill to replace the bill passed by the House of Representatives. This new bill was passed by a majority vote of the committee this afternoon and is prepared to be submitted to the Senate for discussion. The new bill only allows the government to take various necessary measures for the following purposes: to prevent and punish any speculative manipulation that may harm savings and public credit. In addition, the new bill clearly stipulates that the government shall not take the following five measures: (1) Any measures to manage foreign exchange, or to restrict the circulation of foreign currencies and domestic and foreign securities, or to stipulate their prices; (2) Any measures to change the existing gold parity of the franc; (3) Any measures for the nationalization of industry and commerce that are not stipulated by current laws; (4) Compulsory fundraising of national debt or compulsory exchange of government bonds; (5) Any measures to change the existing relationship between the Bank of France and the state. The government shall not take any of the above five measures based on the Full Powers Bill. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas)</p>

<p>[Berlin] The German secret police's crackdown on the Evangelical Church has been extended to various provinces. "Opposition" pastors are being interrogated everywhere, and two more people have been arrested. Since the National Socialist Party came to power, about 500 pastors and church officials have been arrested, imprisoned, or detained in concentration camps. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Philippine Sugar Dumping in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Netherlands Lodges Protest</p>
<p>[Manila] U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, reported to the U.S. Department of State today that it is rumored that the Philippine sugar industry has violated the London Sugar Agreement by overproducing and dumping sugar in Hong Kong, requesting a ruling. Javanese sugar merchants have also requested the Dutch authorities to protest to the U.S. government about this matter. According to a report from the Philippine Sugar Association to McNutt, 4,000 tons of Philippine sugar were shipped to Hong Kong after the London Sugar Agreement was signed. McNutt asked the Philippine Autonomous Government personnel to help stop this dumping, pending the U.S. Department of State's handling. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Internal Dissension Movement in the British Labour Party</h3>
<p>Members of Parliament Criticize Leaders</p>
<p>[London] Labour MP, Mr. Wier, has submitted a lengthy article to the party's Executive Committee criticizing the fact that the party's MPs and parliamentary leaders often remain silent when important issues are raised for discussion. In particular, regarding Prime Minister Chamberlain's abolition of the fixed annual salary (stipulated at 2,000 pounds per year) of the Leader of the Opposition, Labour Party parliamentary leader Major Attlee did not strive for it. Wier especially launched a fierce attack in the article, saying that this would cause the Labour Party to lose the true meaning of its opposition party in Parliament. It is generally believed that Wier's move is enough to prove that the internal dissension movement within the party has become increasingly serious. The party will raise it for discussion at its meeting next Wednesday. (Central News Agency, 19th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Lushan Summer Training</h3>
<p>Administrative Personnel Summoned to Participate; Gather in Lushan in Batches Starting in July</p>
<p>Nanchang correspondence: Lushan has beautiful scenery and a cool climate in the summer, making it a great place for summer recuperation. Chiang Kai-shek held summer military training here in the 22nd and 23rd years [of the Republic], which eventually pacified the bandits. In order to implement this spirit, summer training will continue to be held in Lushan this summer. In advance, lecture halls have been built in Hualian Academy to provide accommodation for trainees. The scale is quite grand and has been completed. Those summoned for training include principals and deans of instruction of middle schools, scout instructors, commissioners of various administrative regions, section chiefs of county governments, and directors of county education bureaus. They will gather in Lushan in batches from July 1st to August 30th to undergo rigorous training. The main subjects are spiritual speeches, specialized lectures, and instructions from central figures, so that the spirit of the top and bottom can be connected as one. Currently, the Xun-Lu road is crowded with officials, and the price of houses in Guling is more than double that of last year due to the shortage of supply. (June 18th)</p>
<h3>Wuchang District Procuratorate Appeals the Yang Assassination Case</h3>
<p>Currently Reviewing Case Files and Drafting Supplementary Reasons for Appeal; Yang Family Files Independent Appeal on Civil Matters</p>
<p>Hankou correspondence: After the first instance judgment of the assassination case of the late Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Yang Yongtai, except for Li Qunjian, who was declared not guilty, the remaining seven defendants, Liu Luyin, Cheng Xiechao, Gong Baizhou, Cao Bingrong, Yang Qixin, Nie Jingquan, and Wen Maoguan, all filed appeals one after another. The prosecutor of the Wuchang District Court in charge of the case, Zhu Chengzuan, also filed an appeal, stating only that he disagreed with a part of the judgment in this case, and did not specify whether the appeal was directed at Liu Luyin, Li Qunjian, or other parts. The reasons for the appeal will also be submitted later. In addition, the Yang Yongtai family believes that the sentence imposed on Liu by the court was too light. In addition to expressing their disagreement and requesting the prosecutor to write the appeal on their behalf, they also filed an independent appeal on the civil part. The original text of their attached civil appeal is as follows: 1. Appellants Yang Li Wuzhen, Yang Yixi, Yang Xuanxi, Yang Qiuxi, Yang Yanxi, Yang Chenxi, Yang Lianxi, and Yang Zhunxi, and Yang Tang Xueyong, the legal representative of the four people on the right, are appealing the judgment of the attached civil lawsuit for the murder case of Liu Luyin, etc., because they disagree with the judgment. The court ordered the defendants Liu Luyin, Cheng Xiechao, Gong Baizhou, and Cao Bingrong to jointly and severally compensate the plaintiffs for damages of 20,000 yuan in national currency and a consolation fee of 10,000 yuan, and rejected the remaining claims. However, the plaintiffs filed an incidental civil lawsuit in accordance with Article 192, Paragraph 2, Article 194 of the Civil Code, and Article 491, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, requesting compensation for support expenses of 118,560 yuan and a consolation fee of 100,000 yuan, based on the status of the victim and the living conditions of the victim's family, and the degree of mental suffering, as well as the status and financial resources of the perpetrator. The victim, Yang Gong Yongqin, had served in important positions and advocated integrity, which was known to all. He devoted himself to public affairs and neglected his family's production. All the family's education and upbringing expenses depended on his salary income. The plaintiffs have a large family, some studying abroad, some studying at domestic universities, some just entering middle school, or even entering elementary school together. The cost is self-evident. Now that the public has been killed suddenly, the children have lost their father, and the whole family is dependent. Not only is the future bleak, but also the current life is difficult to support, and the mental suffering is even more difficult to describe. The original judgment stated that the amount of compensation requested by the plaintiffs was not much, which was indeed a brilliant view. However, because the defendants Cheng Xiechao, Gong Baizhou, and Cao Bingrong were all poor and had no property, and also speculated that Liu Luyin was not wealthy, they only ordered the defendants to jointly and severally compensate for support expenses of 20,000 yuan and a consolation fee of 10,000 yuan, and rejected the remaining claims, which was not enough to convince them. How the property situation of Cheng Xiechao, Gong Baizhou, and Cao Bingrong was, has not been investigated by their authority, and it is difficult to determine whether they have the ability to compensate. As for Liu Luyin, he is a member of the Central Committee, a standing member of the Mass Movement Committee, and was appointed Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Government and Vice President of the Examination Yuan of the National Government. His position is not unimportant. He also organized the China Youth Special Forces, with monthly expenses of thousands of yuan, and organized the Revolutionary Corps, which was even larger in scale. The headquarters has departments for secretaries, organization, propaganda, transportation, finance, etc. The defendant Liu Luyin is currently the leader and is in charge of the regiments, battalions, companies, and squads. How could he organize it without sufficient funds? The general charter of the Revolutionary Corps was approved and implemented by Liu Luyin in his capacity as leader, and it did not indicate who was responsible for the expenses. It is even more proof that this huge amount of funds was provided by the defendant personally, a counter-revolutionary leader who has usurped high positions and possesses huge assets. The original judgment actually speculated that he was not wealthy, which was obviously inappropriate. It is not enough to appeal to seek relief. It is now reported that Liu Luyin and others have recklessly filed an appeal against the criminal judgment. Please submit the appeal of this attached civil lawsuit together to the second instance court for trial to correct it. It is a public convenience. It is respectfully reported that when this case will be transferred to the High Court, it is said that the District Court Prosecutor still needs to review the case files and draft the reasons for the appeal, which will be delayed until next week. The High Court must wait for the District Court to send the entire case file and the appellants' reasons for appeal to be fully stated before it can start researching and then decide on the hearing date. According to the President of the High Court, Xi Jun, the court has three criminal courts, the first, second, and third, each with a president and two judges. Cases are handled on a rotating basis in a certain way. It is still impossible to predict which court will hear the reasons and who will be responsible. (June 18th)</p>
<h3>Pinghan Railway Huage Branch Line Officially Commences Construction</h3>
<p>The Entire Line is 300 Kilometers Long; Funding of 25 Million</p>
<p>Hankou correspondence: The Ministry of Railways ordered the Pinghan Railway Bureau to construct the Huage branch line. Planning began in January last year, and now it is ready. At 12:00 noon on the 17th, a commencement ceremony was held at the Huayuan Station. Commander-in-Chief of the Executive Yuan, He Chengjun, attended in person, and the Provincial Government sent Director of the Construction Department, Wu Tingyang, as a representative to participate. After all the ceremonies were held, more than 300 workers began work immediately. The Huage branch line is one of the branch lines under the Pinghan Railway. It starts from Huayuan Station and passes through the territories of Xiaogan, Anlu, Yingshan, Suixian, Zaoyang, and Xiangyang counties to Laokou in Guanghua County. All the areas along the way are densely populated and rich in products in northern Hubei. The total length is 104 kilometers. In the past, transportation was inconvenient, and product transportation was extremely difficult. Although a highway was built later, connecting Hankou directly to Laokou, passing through Jun and Yun and reaching Baihe to connect to the Shaanxi border, it was still not enough to cope with the situation. The Ministry of Railways believes that the road connects Qin and Long in the north and Bashu in the west. If a branch line is built, it can make the northwest border area closely connected with the Yangtze River basin, which is beneficial to military affairs, politics, society, people's livelihood, and the progress of the country's entire road administration. Therefore, it was decided to build the Huage branch line. The construction cost, including locomotives, vehicles, and all equipment, was originally budgeted at 20 million yuan in national currency. Later, due to soaring material prices and steel mountain prices, the funding budget was increased by 15 million yuan, bringing the total to 35 million yuan. The Ministry ordered that the construction time be completed within two years from the date of commencement of construction, and limited the completion of the 110-kilometer section from Huayuan to Lishan in Suixian within this year. The branch line was also named the Huage branch line by the Ministry, and the Huage Branch Line Engineering Office was established, subordinate to the Bureau. According to the Bureau's prediction, after the branch line is completed, there will be many benefits. From the perspective of the Bureau's economy, on the day the line is completed and open to traffic, there will be more than 300,000 tons of freight transported annually. This income is enough to bear the interest on the construction cost of the line. The completion of this branch line will also increase the operating income of the main line by more than 1 million yuan per year, which is sufficient to cover the principal and interest on its construction capital.

<h3>Construction of a Scenic Route in the ZOU-LU Sage Area</h3>
<p>Sun Tongxuan Repairs Roads to Facilitate Visitation and Sightseeing</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Construction Department of Shandong Province, Taian County, and Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the 20th Division, recently collaborated on a plan to develop Mount Qin. Sun Tongxuan is also actively developing Qufu and Zou County in Yanzhou as the hometowns of Confucius and Mencius and the birthplace of Chinese culture. The highway between Yanzhou and Qufu has long been completed, with shady trees lining the road and a pavilion every few miles as a resting place for travelers. The pavilions feature stone carvings of Confucian and Mencian maxims, allowing people to hear the teachings of the sages even on their journeys. Furthermore, Zou County is where the Mencius Temple and the Mencius Tomb are located, and Mount Ni in the county is where Confucius' mother prayed for and gave birth to Confucius, and Fuzhuang is the hometown of Mencius. Therefore, the highway is being extended from Qufu, passing through Mount Ni, to Fuzhuang in Zou County, a distance of about 180 miles, which can be toured by car in two hours. Those traveling by Jinpu Railway can disembark at Zou County, Qufu, or Yanzhou. There are also plans to build a road from Taian Railway Station, passing through the western mountains of Mount Tai, to Zhongtianmen, where visitors can then switch to mountain sedan chairs to climb the mountain. In the future, transportation to famous scenic spots in southern Shandong will be convenient. What was once the Sage Area has now become a scenic route.</p>

<p>Threat of Explosives Against the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Luodian Township Chamber of Commerce in the Fourth District of the county received threatening letters and a package of explosives on the 17th. It is believed that the reason is related to the increase in business tax rates, blaming the chamber for failing to effectively fight for reductions or exemptions. Regarding the tax increase issue, Chairman Xu Shenqian is reportedly working on a solution.</p>
<p>The County Government Strictly Pursues Overdue Taxes</p>
<p>The county government has always strictly pursued the collection of new and old overdue taxes. With the spring harvest approaching, an order was issued on the 18th to collect all overdue taxes for the first and second periods of the 25th year, as well as any arrears from previous years, to be fully paid by the end of this month. Those who intentionally delay will be severely punished to emphasize the importance of taxation.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Peppermint Prices Soar</p>
<p>In recent years, the rice harvest in this county has been poor, and farmers have switched to planting peppermint. As a result, production has increased year by year. The county now has over 4,000 mu planted, producing over 20,000 jin of oil. As the first harvesting period approaches, factories have set the oil price at 7.5 yuan per jin on the market scale. This year, due to demand exceeding supply, the price has increased by three yuan compared to last year. Leaflets have also been distributed to explain the second harvesting methods in detail, to increase farmers' income.</p>
<p>Appeal in Embezzlement Case</p>
<p>Jin Mingshu, the director of the county's Tooth Tax Collection Office, was reported to the county government by Wu Xiangfeng, an employee of the office, for embezzling educational construction surcharges. After a trial, the county sentenced Jin Mingshu to six months of penal servitude for embezzlement and fined him 300 yuan. Jin refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court, which has been approved. A summons was issued on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Students from Perming Hair</p>
<p>The County Education Bureau believes that many female teachers and students in primary and secondary schools throughout the county have permed hair and revealing clothing, which is contrary to the true meaning of the New Life Movement. To rectify this, it has been decided to strictly prohibit such behavior. Starting next year, teachers who continue to engage in such behavior will be suspended, and students will be expelled.</p>
<p>Labor Unrest Criminals Transferred to the Commissioner's Office</p>
<p>On the 6th of this month, a strike occurred at the Lixin Textile Dyeing Company in this county. The police chief, He Yuliang, was drowned on the spot, and several officers and police were injured. After suppression by the military and police and mediation by the party and government, work resumed. The perpetrators who caused the trouble, including Wang Tongkun and Ge Boquan, and 30 plus people, were arrested by the police and transferred to the county government for interrogation. County Magistrate Long believed that the case was related to disturbing local public security and transferred eleven key people, including Wang Tongkun, to the Security Command of the First District for handling. To prevent labor unrest, the Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of representatives from the county government, the Party Department, the garrison 88th Division, the Chamber of Commerce, the Police Bureau, the Construction Bureau, and various yarn and silk factories. It was decided that the county government would organize a committee involving relevant factories to discuss ways to eliminate the unrest.</p>
<p>Levying a Wheat Business Tax</p>
<p>The case of the temporary wheat business tax has been strongly opposed by grain merchants for two years without a resolution. In the spring of this year, the Ministry of Finance sent a special committee to Shanghai to repeatedly discuss with representatives from various flour mills in Shanghai and Gu Xin, the chairman of the Grain Association. An agreement was reached: (1) A temporary business tax of 1.2 cents will be levied on each bag of wheat, based on a weight of 100 jin, plus an inspection fee of 8 cash, for a total of 1 cent per bag. (2) The local business tax bureau will check the factory's wheat import register monthly to calculate the number of bags and collect the tax accordingly. The above measures will be implemented on July 1. However, the flour mills believe that the situation in inland flour mills is different from that in Shanghai. The raw wheat they purchase is all obtained from grain merchants and not directly from grain merchants, making it impossible to collect the tax on their behalf. The grain merchants also claim that they face many difficulties. Therefore, after receiving the notice, they have requested the Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Ministry of Finance, arguing that, according to the established practice of levying a unified tax without imposing other damaging taxes, they should strive to alleviate the merchants' difficulties.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Transfer of Judges from the Shanghai Court</p>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court, under the order of the Ministry of Justice, has reassigned Shao Qinzhi, a judge from the Shanghai District Court, to another position. Weng Zhenshu has been appointed to fill the vacancy, and Qiu Hongzao has been appointed as the chief clerk of the Shanghai District Court. President Zhu immediately issued an order to inform the Shanghai District Court.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Strict Pursuit of Embezzled Funds</p>
<p>Hou, the county magistrate of Wuyi County, organized a review committee to audit previous years' receipts. Discovering a shortage of more than 395,000 yuan, the county magistrate had the two treasury custodians placed under surveillance and required them to provide guarantees for the recovery of the funds. However, after a long delay, the exact amounts owed by each individual have not been clearly verified by the two treasury officials. The deputy chiefs of field taxation, Wei Guojun and Mao Feiran, were ordered to pay the shortfall by the 18th of this month, or they would be dismissed. After receiving the order, the two chiefs worked overnight and calculated the specific amounts owed by each person on the evening of the 18th. In addition to the 60,000 yuan previously paid, they gathered another 45,000 yuan on the 19th and presented a detailed account of the arrears over the years, requesting that the remaining amount be paid in installments. The county government will submit a report to the authorities for instructions.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Over One Million Collected in Field Taxes</p>
<p>The county government has collected over 700,000 yuan in overdue field taxes from Tong County and over 450,000 yuan in new taxes, totaling over 1.16 million yuan, an unprecedented amount. The debts of various county and national agencies have been cleared.</p>
<h3>Mingguang</h3>
<p>Reorganization and Expansion of the Power Plant</p>
<p>The Daminguang Power Plant in this port, originally sponsored by the Cotton and Cloth Industry Association, could not develop its business due to its small machines. It has now been taken over by the Bangbu Yaohuai Power Plant. It is reported that the plant has a large machine that can supply 5,000 lights. The site has been surveyed, and it is expected that power generation can begin in October.</p>
<p>Resumption of Ming-Xu Road Bus Service</p>
<p>The Ming-Xu Road long-distance bus service was temporarily suspended due to the roadbed near Qingshuiba being washed away by mountain floods. Repairs are now underway, and the work should be completed in a few days. To prevent traffic disruption, the bus service will continue as usual, but passengers will need to change vehicles where passage is impossible.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Deadline for Eliminating Opium Addiction</p>
<p>The county government has designated the Fourth and Sixth Districts as opium-free zones. All licensed opium smokers must quit by the end of June. All opium dens and places for opium use must be completely closed by July 1st of this year. Opium smokers who have already quit will be re-examined to ensure thoroughness.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Holds 8th General Membership Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Report on the general commercial situation over the past year, 19 resolutions passed, declaration to safeguard national industry issued</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce held its 8th General Membership Meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. A declaration to safeguard national industry was resolved and issued, along with other important resolutions. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives present included: Representatives from the Municipal Party Department, Wang Manyun and Zhu Yakui; representatives from the Social Bureau, Wu Huanru and Song Zhongqing; and representatives from various industry associations including cotton cloth, tobacco leaf, cigarette factory, silk, new medicine, bank, pawnshop, construction company, iron industry, shipping, money exchange, rice shop, miscellaneous grain, sugar, glass, silk weaving, medicinal materials, silk factory, rice milling, pawnshop, transportation, wood industry, copper and iron machinery, insurance, paper industry, copper and tin, bean and rice merchant, land cargo, fresh fish, foil and inland shipping, fruit and land cargo, and books; Zhenhua Paint Company, Huasheng Ronghao, Yong'an Textile Company, Dazhong Company, Huashang Electric Company, Dazhong Coal Mine Company, Xinxin Company and other stores' representatives, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiying, Jin Runxiang, Ke Ganchen, Lu Feibohong, Shen Weiting, Chen Ziyi, Zheng Zenan, Fang Yexian, Xu Yangnan, Zhu Zixiang, Zhu Wenqi, Luo Qinghua, Lin Ruiting, Yuan Ludeng, Nie Shaoquan, Fang Jiaobo, Wei Shanfu, Pei Yunxiang, Gu Xinyi, Xu Chengxun, Ma Jiliang, Xu Xinliu, Yue Fucheng, Yu Zuoting, Guo Shun, Pan Xusheng, Chen Jianting, Xia Deyang, Kai Lanting, Dong Zihua, Yang Guanbei, Chen Ziming, Zou Jingcheng, Wang Jiemei, Fang Yuxiang, and other two hundred and fifty-one people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>After the meeting was opened and formalities were performed, Chairman Wang Xiaolai gave an opening address, stating: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has a long history. This is the fourth general membership meeting since the establishment of the unified chamber. We should report on the matters handled by the chamber this year for the examination of the member representatives. However, since there is a special report, I will not repeat it here. I would like to briefly describe the general commercial situation over the past year and how to strive for progress in the future, as a mutual encouragement to all our merchants. Last year, with the bumper harvests in the provinces along the Yangtze River, the stability of the legal tender, and the abundance of chips, consumers' purchasing power increased, and prices gradually rose, leading to a revival in some commercial sectors. This is something we can celebrate. However, for some sectors, the prosperity was only temporary, and the aftermath of the commercial depression has not easily changed the overall situation. This is evidenced by the frequent advertisements for store closures and the increase in bankruptcy cases announced by the courts. Moreover, the prosperity of domestic commerce depends on the rural areas. Last year, we were fortunate to have a bumper harvest, but this year, the drought-stricken provinces cover a wide area. Therefore, whether consumers' purchasing power can maintain the same standard as last year is doubtful. In addition, the smuggling trend is increasingly rampant, and foreign merchants in the textile industry in North China have already taken over the main business. Their light industries are also gradually being operated on a large scale, seeking to monopolize them. In all these circumstances, the domestic market is shrinking day by day. Our country's tariffs are not even comparable to the so-called protection levels of other countries. However, even this foundation is now being shaken. First, there is large-scale smuggling, and then there are open demands for tax cuts. We are afraid that the crude-scale domestic goods factories will be forced to a point where they cannot survive. Furthermore, countries are competing in quasi-wartime economies and controls. They either restrict or manage the export of raw materials they need or compete to buy them at high prices. Just taking paper and pig iron as examples, they have already had a profound impact on our country's industrial and commercial sectors. Our country relies on foreign merchants as intermediaries for trade. Foreign countries often want to directly purchase large quantities of our country's goods or are willing to exchange goods with our country, but our country does not have agencies to supply large quantities, so it cannot meet their needs. For example, in the case of raw silk, since our country has no direct export agencies, this year's silk harvest in Japan is abundant, and the European and American markets can meet supply and demand. However, foreign merchants operating silk in China are still hesitant and unwilling to take action. We do not know what will happen to the silk market this year. As another example, the construction industry is on the verge of stagnation due to soaring raw material prices. Considering the above situations, we should know that domestic and foreign commercial competition has already entered the final five minutes of close combat. Without thorough awakening and a firm determination, we will inevitably suffer a complete defeat. We cannot be complacent with the temporary prosperity of last year. However, in terms of our country's progress, there are several things that can be cited as comforting: (1) The financial sector can cooperate with the industrial sector. For example, the two textile factories in Tianjin survived and prospered, and the Hunan Second Textile Factory is being planned and completed, all thanks to the support of the banking syndicate. (2) The financial sector can penetrate into the rural areas, provide loans, and guide cooperation to cultivate the purchasing power of the vast masses. (3) Industrialists can cooperate with specialized technicians. Therefore, in recent years, our country has indeed had some chemical industries that can compete with foreign products and stand on a solid and unshakable foundation. Tianyuan, Yongli, and Wuzhou are all well-known and need not be mentioned. (4) Government and businesses can gradually cooperate sincerely, eliminating the previous suspicion and discrimination. Therefore, there are often some industries and businesses that combine the administrative volume of the public sector with the technical experts they attract to operate jointly, making progress easier and reducing many future difficulties. For example, vegetable oil factories, tea companies, the Shanghai Fish Market, and Wenxi Paper Mill are the most obvious examples. The merchants of this city stand on the front line of the commercial war. At this time of increasing global changes, they should strive to maintain and promote the points of progress they have already made. They should also seriously reflect on their shortcomings and gradually eliminate them. The Chamber of Commerce, as a merchant group, shares weal and woe. On the one hand, it is willing to offer its experience from the past year as a warning. On the other hand, it also hopes that the merchants of the city and the member representatives will provide deep guidance for the future direction of the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Addresses from Party and Government Representatives</p>
<p>(1) Wang Manyun, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, said in brief: The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce has made great achievements in various aspects since last year, such as conducting research on income tax issues and assisting the government in combating smuggling. We express our sincere admiration. The chairman just mentioned the social decline, rural bankruptcy, and other situations in recent years, which are indeed worthy of our attention. The current smuggling trend continues unabated, and our country's industry and commerce are constantly threatened. This makes us feel a hidden worry. Therefore, at this 8th General Membership Meeting, we should find ways to maintain social prosperity and break the bankruptcy of the rural areas. This city is in the front line, as the chairman just mentioned, and is extremely important. All of you are soldiers on the front line. At this time of serious national crisis, we should prepare to consolidate this first line of defense, concentrate our strength, unite, and defend against foreign attacks. We hope that the City Chamber of Commerce will make efforts to promote the development of past construction and determine the direction of future progress, together with the representatives of various industries present today. (2) Wu Huanru, representative of the Municipal Social Bureau, said in brief: Over the past year, officials and civilians in our country have been able to thoroughly awaken and cooperate, which is what the ancients called "great adversity revives the nation." The depth of the stimulation is enough to produce the current phenomenon. We have seen the achievements of various construction projects and the awakening and progress of the industrial sector. These are all gratifying phenomena. The issue of promoting national goods, which has been advocated for more than 20 years, has now been largely resolved. Consumers know how to purchase domestic goods, and producers also know how to strive to improve and satisfy customers. Therefore, the national goods movement no longer needs to be promoted in the future. In recent years, the industrial and commercial sectors have indeed taken on a new look. Even in heavy industry, such as the chemical sector, nitric acid, acetic acid, and hydrochloric acid can all be created independently without relying on foreigners. There are countless other domestic factories manufacturing textiles, printing machinery, and so on. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government. I was ordered to organize an industrial exhibition. Judging from the many industrial products that have been solicited, there are many that are not as good as foreign goods, but there are also many that can surpass foreign goods. From this, we can observe that producers are indeed cooperating closely with consumers and advancing on the same front. Over the past year, more than half of the city's industries and businesses have been able to obtain considerable profits for many reasons, such as the increase in rural purchasing power and the effectiveness of the legal tender policy. However, this year's disastrous conditions in various provinces have made everyone worry that the harvest of industry and commerce may not be as good as last year. However, I believe that under a unified will, with our steadfast cooperation and doing our best, we can overcome our environment and create our environment. I believe that when we hold the annual meeting here next year, the industrial and commercial sectors will definitely have better results. What we cannot do this year, we will definitely be able to do next year. I wish you all progress and health.</p>
<p>Discussion of Various Resolutions After the addresses, Chairman Du Yuesheng and Xu Jiying reported on the Chamber's handling of affairs over the past year. Pei Yunxiang, director of the Finance Department, and Xu Xinliu, director of the Three Successive Bonds Fund Management Committee, reported on finances. Then, the following resolutions were discussed and decided: (1) The Chamber proposed a declaration to safeguard national industry (the declaration is shown later) and was resolved to pass and publish it. (2) Urge the government to promptly promulgate the new Chamber of Commerce Law and the new Industrial and Commercial Guild Law. Resolved to have the Executive Committee appoint representatives to present the petition to the central government, along with representatives appointed by various industry guilds. (3) The Chamber's final accounts for the 25th year and the budget for the 26th year were resolved to pass. (4) Resolved to withdraw the lawsuit against Yongxing Money Shop for owing funds to the Chamber's fund. (5) Resolved to pass the resolution to implement Article 13 of the Executive Charter, which stipulates that those who do not pay the annual membership fee will be suspended from attending the General Assembly of that year. (6) Resolved to pass the resolution to request the government to maintain the original import tariff and to intensify anti-smuggling efforts. (7) Article 681 of the Civil Law stipulates that partners in business should bear joint and several liability, which is inconsistent with the inherent commercial practice of bearing liability according to shares. It is proposed to appeal to the Legislative Yuan to amend the law. Resolved to hand it over to the Executive Committee for consideration. (8) Resolved to pass the resolution to request the government to issue a clear order prohibiting the export of wheat in order to prioritize the people's food supply. (9) The new cattle and sheep border crossing tax imposed by the French Concession Public Works Bureau in this city harms merchants and the people and damages national sovereignty. Repeated petitions to the municipal government for negotiations have been ineffective. It is proposed to request the General Assembly to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the French Ambassador and order its prompt cancellation, and to order the abolition of the compulsory pre-purchase of inspection tickets in order to maintain national sovereignty and alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Resolved to pass it. (10) Resolved to vigorously implement the sanctions prescribed by the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the Central Party Department for not joining industry guilds. (11) Resolved to request that all industries with industry guilds should, in the event of disputes between members arising from business, not immediately litigate, but first apply to the industry guild to attempt mediation (principle passed, handed over to the Executive Committee for handling). (12) Resolved to submit a petition to the government to establish iron refineries to manufacture iron sheets so that commercial use can be self-sufficient and to prevent huge amounts of leakage. Resolved to pass it. (13) Documents used in trade with foreign merchants must be ordered to affix stamps in accordance with the regulations to emphasize official orders, and the phrase "in case of doubts, the English text shall prevail" commonly used in trade should be deleted and changed to "the Chinese text shall prevail" in order to maintain the principle of equality. Resolved to notify all members to implement it. (14) Recommend that the government eliminate old non-decimal auxiliary coins and add half-cent auxiliary coins to avoid raising the level of life. Resolved to hand it over to the Executive Committee to invite experts to study and then recommend to the government. (15) Proposed to request the Ministry of Finance to exempt the transit tax on domestic goods in order to benefit industry. Resolved to pass it in principle and hand it over to the Executive Committee for handling. (16) Resolved to pass the resolution to petition the Ministry of Railways to order the administrations of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Tianjin-Pukou Railways to quickly prepare more vehicles in order to clear the backlog of goods, and to collect opinions from various industries on difficulties in road transportation and submit them together. (17) Resolved to submit a proposal to the Ministry of Industry to correct the names of foreign-style guilds in order to show uniformity and conform to reality. (18) Resolved to petition party and government organs at all levels to improve the organization of merchant groups and absolutely prohibit division. (19) Urge the Legislative Yuan to quickly review and amend the Chamber of Commerce Law, the Commercial Trade Association Law, the Industrial Trade Association Law, and the Export Trade Association Law and promulgate them for implementation in order to benefit production and construction and revive the national economy. Resolved to pass and handle it together with the second resolution. (20) Discussion of temporary proposals was handed over to the Executive Committee for handling. Before the chairman reported, a sound system was installed by a Chinese and Western pharmacy for today's meeting, and the sound was clear and loud and very suitable. Thanks should be extended. This sound system was designed and manufactured by the pharmacy itself, specifically for serving society. Any group or organization can officially send a letter to the pharmacy to borrow it. The meeting also distributed one copy each of the Partnership Law and Regulations published by the Chamber's Commercial Monthly, and an Interpretation of Income Tax Regulations published by Libao Publishing House. Taikang Company presented a small box of high-quality biscuits and a fan.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Declaration: The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce issued a declaration to safeguard the national industry, stating that since the completion of unification and the stability of the political situation, the central government has carefully considered the national situation and examined neighboring countries, and has made efforts in economic construction as the most important plan to stabilize the country. At the Third Plenary Session, a declaration was issued to the people of the country, stating that "the reason why our country is poor is due to the encroachment of enemy countries externally and the backwardness of production internally. If class struggle is incited internally, it will be enough to offset the strength of the entire nation and plunge the country into destruction. Internally, it will be enough to cause a mixed war between various production elements and prevent the progress of production construction." It hopes that both labor and capital will work together on the open road of production construction and share the heavy responsibility of national revival. The words are sincere and earnest, and every member of the Republic of China, upon reading them, will be excited and think about how to serve the country. The industrial and commercial sectors bear this mission. Therefore, although they have endured the city's declining market conditions over the years, the dumping of foreign goods, the surge of smuggling, and the difficulty of business, they have not failed to uphold their spirit of fighting alone and to make repeated efforts. It is not for personal gain, but also to prevent the industrial wind and rain in the boat with the world economy between the tide floating away.</p>

<p>The National Rice Marketing Inspection Group, consisting of members Zhao Zhi Zhou, Cui Liang Gong, Lin Ruo Fu, Xu Yue Cen, Xu Zhong Fu, Kang Yue Ling, Zhuo Bao Ting, experts Shen Guo Jin, Xu Ri Kun, Lin Xi Chun, Mei Sheng Mao, and others, a total of eleven people, departed for Hong Kong at ten o'clock yesterday morning aboard the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hai Zhen" steamer. Those who came to the Jin Li Yuan Wharf to see them off included Gu Xin Yi, Chairman of the Cereal, Oil, and Cake Trade Association, and Committee Member Chen Zi Yi, among others. Group Leader Zheng Baozhao made a last-minute change and took a China National Aviation Corporation plane on the Shanghai-Guangzhou route at eight o'clock yesterday morning, flying to Guangzhou first. After the group arrives in Hong Kong by steamer, they will take a train to Guangzhou to meet with Group Leader Zheng Baozhao and Hunan members Huang Pei Shi and Hu De Biao, and then begin their inspection. The inspection locations include Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou, a total of five locations, and the duration will be one month, it is said. It is to be the bastion of national rejuvenation. Therefore, the Third Plenary Session's declaration included the statement: "Those who know the circumstances of their difficult struggle truly cannot help but sympathize." This association deeply feels the government's virtuous influence and seeks the broad sympathy of the world. Recently, labor unrest has been rising and falling. The records in various newspapers and the appeals of various industries have made the fledgling industry feel deeply uneasy. The aftershocks have spread to Wuxi, Changsha, and other places. Observing the general trend, it seems that there is a possibility of destroying national industry. How can conscience allow us to remain silent? This association respectfully extends the declaration of the Third Plenary Session, believing that our country must maintain the light and heavy industries necessary for "self-sufficiency" and "self-defense," and then our nation can stand gloriously on the earth for ten thousand years. The key lies in the cooperation of all the people, regardless of boundaries. Only then can national industry flourish and grow. Therefore, protecting this fledgling industry is protecting the Chinese nation. This association sincerely seeks the sympathy of the national people for the above solemn and simple declaration, and each strives to fulfill their duties as a member of the nation. This is the declaration.</p>

<h3>The Bureau of Public Works is Repairing Seawalls</h3>
<p>Approved by the Municipal Government to Allocate Funds for Repairs, Tenders to be Invited in the Near Future</p>
<p>The east, west, and Zhou San seawalls under the jurisdiction of this city, approximately 24 kilometers in length, have been in disrepair for many years and are in danger of collapsing. It is reported that the Municipal Government has spent no less than six or seven hundred thousand yuan on seawall expenses from 1930 to 1935, including emergency repairs, individual repairs, and new construction. This shows the importance that the authorities attach to seawalls. In recent years, all places that have been built with proper engineering have been quite safe. However, there are still many places along the seawall that have not been built with protection projects and are still in danger. It is reported that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has submitted a request to the Municipal Government to allocate funds for repairs, and tenders will be invited in the near future, it is said.</p>

<h3>Six Companies Drastically Increase Northern Shipping Costs Starting on the 23rd</h3>
<p>Barge Fees Increase to $2.80, Flour Increases to $0.65</p>
<p>In recent months, Northern shipping has been booming, with goods piling up. However, the Hai River in Tianjin is silting up and the water level is falling sharply. Ships with deeper drafts can only go to Tanggu and cannot enter Zizhu Lin. Most of the goods going to Tianjin are now transported by barges. Yesterday, the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, Sanbei, China Merchants, and Kailuo companies held a meeting to discuss the urgent need to raise the barge fees for goods shipped from Shanghai to Tanggu. They decided to raise the barge fees from $1.50 per ton to $2.80 starting on the 23rd of this month.

<h3>Liu Ruiheng Returned to Shanghai to Discuss Eradicating the Plague</h3>
<p>Training Personnel to Go to Various Counties, Striving to Kill Rats and Prevent Rats, Medicines for Treating Kala-Azar Can Be Made</p>
<p>This year, the plague in Fujian has caused more than a thousand deaths, a rare phenomenon in the past thirty years. All parties are paying close attention to this. Liu Ruiheng, head of the Health Corps, made a special trip to Fujian last month to inspect the situation and formulated a nine-year plan to eradicate the plague. He arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency made a special visit to interview him and learned the following details:</p>
<p>Calling a Meeting of Fellow Fujianese</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Liu met with Xiao Bi Chuan, Huang Jian Zhong, Wang Ping Nan, and others, representatives of the Fujian Plague Prevention and Control Committee, at his hotel to discuss the eradication measures in detail. It was decided to convene a meeting of Fujianese in Shanghai and relevant parties at the YMCA on Baxianqiao at 2:00 PM today, where Liu will report on his proposed five-year plan to eradicate the plague. The Plague Prevention and Control Committee has also drafted a five-year plan to eradicate the plague, which will also be presented for discussion at the meeting.</p>
<p>Liu Discusses the Plague Eradication Plan</p>
<p>Liu told reporters yesterday that the plague in Fujian Province is indeed rampant. It is very difficult to eradicate the plague. India has been preventing and controlling the plague for decades, but it has not been completely eradicated. The Bureau of Health is paying close attention to this and has dispatched doctors, health inspectors, and engineers to Fujian to carry out relief work, such as vaccinations. However, this is a passive measure. The active measure is to seek eradication. Because the plague is caused by rats, there is no way to eliminate the plague without reducing rats. Therefore, to eradicate the plague, we must first reduce rats. A plan has been formulated to train 160 staff members in the first phase, with special attention to training in rat extermination. It can be completed by the end of the month and dispatched to various counties as basic team members, equipped with rat extermination equipment and medicines. After these more than one hundred basic personnel are sent to various counties, it is hoped that the county governments and local Baojia will work together to teach them the extermination methods to expand the work of killing, preventing, and catching rats. If we continue to work hard like this, it may be possible to clear the plague after five years.</p>
<p>Confidence in Preventing and Treating Kala-Azar</p>
<p>Liu continued to talk about the prevention and control of Kala-Azar, saying that the treatment of this disease is more certain than the plague. The Bureau of Health has dispatched staff members to work in the Qingjiangpu area. The treatment of Kala-Azar is absolutely certain. However, the medicine is very expensive. Because the area affected by Kala-Azar is quite wide, with hundreds of thousands of patients, the Bureau is organizing treatment teams and is also studying how to manufacture its own medicines. It is still in the testing phase and will be successful soon. After the medicine is successful, because the price is low and it is domestically produced, the vast number of Kala-Azar patients will have no economic problems, and the disease will not be difficult to eliminate. Liu said at the end that the current health work is to select the most urgent matters and those related to the overall national health for implementation first, it is said.</p>

<h3>Long-Distance Telephone Call Notification Method</h3>
<p>Effective July 1</p>
<p>When making a long-distance telephone call and asking someone to answer, the caller may simultaneously request, "If the designated recipient is not available and unable to answer the call, the telephone company should notify the recipient's subscriber and inform the recipient that the caller hopes to receive a return call at a certain time or within a certain time period." After the calling exchange accepts the request, it should notify the receiving exchange to comply. When the receiving exchange calls, if the designated recipient is not available, it should immediately notify the recipient's subscriber of the caller's location, name, address, or telephone number and ask them to notify the recipient to follow the caller's instructions and return the call on time. The calling exchange should also notify the caller to pay the fee and cancel the call according to the regulations. This method is currently only available on the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hankou, and Shanghai-Guangzhou direct circuits. It is learned that the Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate the public and promote business, has stipulated that this method will be implemented nationwide for all long-distance telephone calls starting on July 1 of this year and has ordered all exchanges to comply with the regulations, it is said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's Joint Celebration Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau has more than 800 employees. Because they are usually tied to their duties, there are few opportunities for everyone to gather and shake hands. Therefore, the bureau holds a joint celebration once a year, bringing employees and their families together. The joint celebration society organized by the bureau's employees will stage traditional Chinese opera and various recreational performances to add to the fun. This year's joint celebration is scheduled to be held at the Xu Garden on Kang Nao Road in this city from 1:00 PM today (the 20th). The program includes martial arts, dramas, magic, music, and traditional Chinese opera. To increase the interest of the guests, each person will receive a tea and pastry coupon and a lottery ticket on the spot. All prizes, in addition to those donated by the bureau's employees, are donated by major companies and factories in this city. The names of all companies, factories, and donated items will be announced separately by the bureau's broadcast station, it is said.</p>
<h3>Land Administration Bureau Approved Shortening the Public Notice Period</h3>
<p>Numerous Land Registration Procedures, Shortened to Three Months to Facilitate Turnover</p>
<p>The Municipal Land Administration Bureau believes that the six-month public notice period for land registration stipulated in Article 100 of the Land Law is too long in view of the actual situation in this city. Because land prices in this city are relatively high and financial circulation often relies on real estate for turnover, land title deeds are often used as collateral and guarantees by the public. Their nature is equivalent to securities. If the public notice period is extended, it will affect the use of title deeds. For the convenience of citizens, it has specially requested the Municipal Government to forward a request to the Central Government to shorten the public notice period to three months. It is now learned that the case has been resolved by the Central Political Committee, and before the amendment to the Land Law is promulgated, it will be temporarily approved for record filing. The National Government has approved the request and ordered the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Interior to inform the Municipal Government for reference. The Municipal Government has ordered the Land Administration Bureau to comply, it is said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South District Property Owners Ordered to Complete Supplementary Registration</h3>
<p>Six Months for Supplementary Registration Starting in October</p>
<p>Land registration in the Shanghai South District of this city began on April 1 of this year. All land that has not been issued a land title deed must be registered within six months after the start of registration. Land that has been issued a land title deed for more than one year and has no disputes shall be deemed to have been registered in accordance with Article 5 of the Shanghai Land Registration Implementation Rules. The Land Administration Bureau shall reissue land title deeds within a certain period. It is now learned that the land title deeds previously issued by the bureau only contain the land register household name and Mu Fen. The types of land to be registered, the usage status, the declared land price, whether there are other rights and interests, the existence and value of fixed objects, and the age, origin, occupation, and address of the owners are not recorded. If, according to Article 26, Paragraph 2 of the Land Law Enforcement Law, it is recorded in the register and a land title deed is reissued, the various indicators in the register and deed cannot be fully prepared according to the law. Therefore, land that has been issued a title deed for more than one year and has no disputes can be considered to have been registered in law, but in fact, the owners should still be ordered to register and complete the procedures. It has been stipulated that a six-month period from October 1 of this year to March 31, 1938, shall be used for completing the supplementary registration procedures. The application was submitted by the Municipal Government to the Ministry of Interior for approval for record filing. All land owners in the Shanghai South District who have been issued title deeds for more than one year and have no disputes shall complete the supplementary registration procedures within the time limit to be registered according to the law and have the land title deeds reissued, it is said.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Industry Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Take Over the Cotton and Silk Associations</h3>

<p>The Central Government, in order to plan for unified industrial administrative jurisdiction, ordered the Ministry of Industry to take over the Cotton Industry Control Association and the China United Silk Improvement Association, which were sponsored by the National Economic Council. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Industry appointed Zhou Yichun, Yan Shenyu, Zhang Yiou, Xu Tinghu, Ouyang Lun, Tan Xihong, and six others as receiving officers. They are scheduled to come to Shanghai in the coming days to negotiate with the two associations, with the goal of completing the takeover by the end of this month. The Cotton Water Adulteration Control Office under the Cotton Industry Control Association will also be taken over at the same time and transferred to the Ministry of Industry's National Product Inspection Committee, renamed the Cotton Industry Inspection and Supervision Office. According to reliable information obtained by a reporter from the Xinxin News Agency, the Cotton Industry Control Association and the Silk Improvement Association have begun to close down and prepare for the handover. In the future, the Ministry of Industry does not intend to make any changes to the organization and business of the two associations after the takeover. Since the establishment of the Cotton Industry Control Association more than three years ago, Chairman Chen Guangfu and Standing Committee Members Zou Bingwen, Li Shengbo, Ye Zhuotang, and Tang Xinghai have been leaders in the cotton industry and finance. Therefore, the Central Cotton Production Improvement Institute, branches in Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi, Hebei, Hubei, Shanxi, and other provinces, and cotton industry guidance offices in various regions, the Gansu Province Guidance Officer's Office, and the Central and Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, Hunan, Shanxi, Jiangxi, and other provinces to crack down on cotton water adulteration and cotton production and sales offices have been successively established.

<h3>Construction of Public Buildings Directly North of the Customs Inspection Office</h3>
<p>For the Convenience of Travelers and Relatives, Completion Expected Next Year</p>
<p>The "Zi Lin Bao" reports: It is learned that a two-story public building is planned for construction directly north of the Customs Inspection Office in the Bund area, intended for use by arriving and departing travelers and their welcoming relatives. The preliminary plans have been drafted. If approved by the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council, construction will be undertaken on the existing underwater foundation by the Public Works Bureau, at an estimated cost of 200,000 yuan. The building will face Terminals 9, 10, and 11 and connect to the Customs baggage inspection area. In addition to waiting rooms, it will include an information desk and a tea room selling tea and refreshments. This will ensure that those waiting to greet their friends will not suffer from hunger or thirst. Furthermore, newly arrived travelers in Shanghai will not have to inquire about accommodations and other matters in a state of confusion, as they did before. An experienced clerk will inform them of essential information about Shanghai, offering a welcoming experience. The building is said to be approximately 220 feet long and 50 feet deep, directly opposite the Bank of Communications. If constructed, it will likely require driving piles using imported pine from the United States. Therefore, completion is expected next year. Currently, the Municipal Council's accountant is reviewing the budget. After completion, it will likely be submitted to the Public Works Department for review.</p>
<h3>Atlantic Shipping Industry Scheduled to Increase Freight Rates</h3>
<p>Increase of 10% Starting July 1st Due to Rising Expenses and Commodity Prices</p>
<p>Shipping industry news: American shipping companies operating between England and various ports along the eastern coast of the United States and Canada, including American Merchant, Anchor, Baltimore Mail Line, Bristol City Line, White Star Line, Wilson Line, Furness Withy, Manchester Lines, and United States Lines, have announced a 10% increase in freight rates on the aforementioned routes, effective July 1st, due to rising labor costs. This increase in freight rates was anticipated by the New York shipping industry, as increased operating expenses, high commodity prices, and rising wages are the main reasons for the rise in freight rates. The recent seamen's strike in the United States is also likely related to the increase in coastal freight rates. Additionally, three shipping companies operating between the Atlantic and various ports on the west coast of the United States will also increase freight rates for timber and general cargo between New York and California.</p>
<h3>Boiler Explosion on the Fuyang Steamer in the Shallow Waters of Taiping Creek, Fuyang</h3>
<p>Three Stokers Injured, Some Seriously; Huafu Attempts Rescue, Then Collides</p>
<p>The Fuyang steamer, owned by the Sanbei Steamship Company of this port, carrying 897 tons and powered by 2,500 horsepower, with a speed of 15 knots per hour, is an excellent river vessel. On September 2nd of last year, the steamer struck a reef in the Taiping Creek area, 180 li upstream of Yichang, causing a hole in the bottom and damaging the axle. The company sent personnel to rescue the vessel. They took advantage of low tide to run it aground, unloading cargo to Chongqing while repairing the hole. The original plan was to tow it back to Shanghai immediately. However, the upper reaches of the river were too low, preventing downstream travel. After nine months, the damaged parts of the hull have been repaired, awaiting high water to tow the ship to Shanghai for repairs. Recently, the water level in the upper reaches of the river has risen significantly. While being towed out of the shallow waters of Meiren Tuo in Taiping Creek on the 18th, the boiler in the engine room suddenly exploded. Two stokers working in the engine room were seriously injured, and one was slightly injured. Fortunately, the company's Huafu steamer was passing by and rushed to the rescue. However, the Huafu collided with the Fuyang's stern, causing minor damage. The Fuyang was barely towed to Yichang. Upon inspection, the steering gear on the stern of the Fuyang was also damaged. The three injured stokers were sent to the hospital for treatment, and a telegram was sent to Shanghai requesting another tugboat to tow the Fuyang to Shanghai for major repairs.</p>

<h3>Wu Yuanlong's Wife Commits Suicide by Poison; Autopsy Required</h3>
<p>The Deceased Left a Letter to Qin, Stating Economic Hardship and Marital Discord as Reasons for Suicide</p>
<p>Wu Yuanlong married an English woman, (Masy L. Wn) (Mei Xue Ai Wu, 29 years old), on January 1st of last year and resided with her in Shanghai. Later, Wu Yuanlong's opening of the New Dance Hall failed, leaving him heavily in debt and facing multiple lawsuits. Wu then went to work in Sichuan, and Mei Xue resided at the home of Qin Defang, manager of the Public Welfare Cotton Mill, at 860 Yu Yuan Road, as Qin's wife is also English. On the 17th of this month, at 11:30 PM, Mei Xue suddenly went alone to Room 111 of the New Asia Restaurant at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Tiantong Road. Without paying the room fee, she closed the door and went to sleep. At 12:30 PM on the 18th, the waiter Zhang Chunlin went to knock on the door to inquire whether the room would be kept and to collect the room fee, but there was no response. He called the room, but there was no answer. Realizing something was wrong, he forced the door open and found Mei collapsed in the bathtub, which was three-quarters full of water. She was unconscious. He urgently reported this to the Hongkou Police Station, who sent officers to transport Mei to the Gongji Hospital for treatment. However, she died shortly after arriving at the hospital. Police officers found a bottle of sleeping pills in Mei's suitcase. The bottle should have contained 100 pills, but four were missing. Mei's original name was (Nee Kathleen Neary). However, an investigation at the British Consulate revealed that she was not registered there, so they declined to handle the case. The police sent the body to the Feilun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, they reported this to the First Special District Court's Procuratorate, which assigned Prosecutor Song Genshan, along with forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan, to inspect the body. According to Qin Defang, he received a letter from the deceased at 3:00 PM yesterday, stating that she was committing suicide due to economic hardship and marital discord with Wu Yuanlong. However, he did not know that she intended to commit suicide. Xu Runjie, Wu Yuanlong's cousin, stated that Wu Yuanlong is currently in Sichuan, and his family is in Nanjing. He had previously asked the deceased to live with them in Nanjing, but she declined. Therefore, the Wu family provided her with a monthly allowance of 200 yuan. The police believe that it is necessary to perform an autopsy to confirm whether Mei Xue committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. Prosecutor Song ruled that the cause of death was unclear and should be determined after an autopsy by the court's forensic doctor. The body was released to Xu Runjie for burial.</p>
<h3>"Shanghai Times March" Has Been Approved</h3>
<p>Disagreement Among Censors Leads to No Further Cuts</p>
<p>Regarding the report yesterday about the Public Concession banning the screening of the new film "Shanghai Times March," the film was screened twice on Friday morning and afternoon before film censors from the Public and French Concessions. At 3:15 PM, the censors finally decided to allow the film to be screened. Therefore, it will be shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater today. Only the Deputy Police Chief of the Public Concession, Lorimer, and the Deputy Police Chief of the French Concession, Li Xie, attended the screening in the morning. The other two censors, Major Bourne, Deputy Police Chief of the Public Concession, and Lieutenant Blanc, Assistant Police Chief of the French Concession, did not attend. Lorimer and Li Xie still insisted on cutting the scene of a Japanese warship in the Huangpu River, but had no objections to scenes of warships from other countries in the river. They also wanted to delete one or two lines of dialogue that they claimed contained anti-Japanese propaganda. Cosk, an employee of the Peacock Film Company, which distributed the film, stated that the company had already made cuts a month ago at the request of the two censors. Further cuts would damage the value of the film. The argument was heated, and no agreement was reached by lunchtime, resulting in a stalemate and an unpleasant parting. Bourne and Lieutenant Blanc also attended the afternoon screening. After viewing the film, the censors finally approved it without further cuts. It is said that Peacock Film Company would appeal to the Shanghai Film Censor Board if there were any further difficulties, as the film has already been approved by the National Government Film Censor Board.</p>
<h3>Masterminds Behind the Robbery of the Jiangsu Bank Branch Arrested</h3>
<p>Both Suspects Firmly Deny Involvement in the Robbery; Court Orders Remand for Further Debate</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Bank branch at 339 Xinwen Road was preparing to load over 7,000 yuan in banknotes into a car for transport to the head office at 5:00 PM on February 3rd of this year when multiple robbers suddenly appeared, drawing pistols and firing at the bank's security guard Shi Jinzhi (No. 194) and guards Jiang Ziqin and Gu Wenlin. Shi Jinzhi was killed, and Jiang and Gu, along with rickshaw puller Chen Youru, were wounded. Jiang and the others returned fire, injuring Zhang Shaoqing, one of the robbers. The robbers failed to steal the money and fled in a stolen Yunfei automobile. Police officers from the Lao Zha Police Station arrested several suspects, including Chen Changfu, Zhang Shaoqing, Zhao Jinrong, Zhao Youren, and Yang Yuchun, and seized several pistols and a large quantity of ammunition. The First Special District Court convicted Zhang Shaoqing and Zhao Jinrong to death, Chen Changfu to twelve years imprisonment, Zhao Youren to nine and a half years imprisonment, and Yang Yuchun to two and a half years imprisonment. The masterminds of the case, Ren Shaoye (also known as Ren Wenhai, Zhang Yiqing, Ren Huanzhang, Xiao Ren) and Wang Abing (also known as Liu Bingshun, Zhang Zhensheng), remained at large. Hua Zong Detective You A'gen and Detective Lu Gengsheng of the police station arrested Ren and Wang in Anhui and other places. Both denied the charges, claiming that they were working as drivers for a highway transportation company in Anhui and Qingjiang when the Jiangsu case occurred and were not involved in the robbery. The court adjourned the case to investigate in those locations. Zhang Shengqing and the other nine defendants appealed to the Second High Court after sentencing. At the hearing yesterday, Judge Yu upheld the original verdict at the request of the police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, claiming the original trial was correct. The court appointed Lawyer Yu Enliang to defend the defendants, and the court ordered a final decision after a period for debate. Reports from the court's investigations from the regions relating to the cases of Ren and Wang have arrived, and Judge Feng Shide of the First Special District Court held a session to continue the hearing. Police Lawyer Ru Baoyi reported on the case's details. Feng then read the investigative report about Wang Abing's case, stating that the findings had found Wang's statements were not true. Both Ren and Wang firmly denied involvement in the robbery of the Jiangsu Bank and retained Lawyer Huang Xiubo to defend them. The court reviewed the evidence, and ordered the two into detention to await further debate on the case.</p>
<h3>Neighbors Suspected of Jealousy Mutually Accuse Each Other of Intimidation</h3>
<p>The Court Concludes the Hearing, Sentencing Scheduled for a Later Date</p>
<p>Ding Quanbo, owner of the Sparrow Card shop at 246 Fuyou Road, and Zhang Juchun, Ding Yuebo, Bao Nianfu, Zhao Chunhua, Li Binyao, Yu Xiaogao, and others were indicted by Prosecutor Li Fen of the Shanghai District Court for intimidation. The indictment alleges that the defendants, knowing that Wang Shirong's Wang Desheng Sparrow Card shop at Fuyou Road had been in business for decades and was thriving, conspired to obtain his property through intimidation. Early last month, they jointly decided to change the name of the World Sparrow Card Factory, which the Ding Quanbo brothers had originally planned to open on Fuyou Road, to Wang Desheng Shunji Sparrow Card Shop. On the first of last month, Zhang Juchun wrote a sign for Wang Desheng Shunji Sparrow Card Shop and posted it at 246 Fuyou Road. Meanwhile, the defendants Yu Xiaogao, Zhao Chunhua, Bao Nianfu, and others went to intimidate Wang Linshi, Wang Shirong's wife, claiming that Ding Quanbo and the others had pistols and axes and demanding a large sum of money from Wang Linshi as a condition for canceling the Wang Desheng Shunji sign. They also wrote two anonymous threatening letters urging her to comply. On the tenth of the same month, Bao Nianfu took Wang Linshi to lawyer Zhu Yongkang's office in the Zhonghui Building, where they agreed on a payment of 2,000 yuan, to be delivered on the 14th. Wang Linshi informed manager Gao Facai, who reported the case to the Detective Team, leading to the arrests. The defendants claimed that Gao Facai had framed them. They stated that Gao was an associate of Xu, a known gangster, and that his appearance was that of a hoodlum. They requested an investigation into his background, claiming that he was not a legitimate manager but a rival motivated by jealousy. They also pointed out that Gao Facai himself had recently been arrested and detained by the police for writing threatening letters in an extortion case. They requested that he be punished under the regulations for punishing bandits, and that the court transfer him to the Garrison Command for punishment. They claimed that the alleged intimidation was entirely fabricated by Gao himself and requested that the defendants be acquitted. The court ruled that the hearing was concluded and that sentencing would take place on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Wang Xinggao Ordered to Be Re-tried By the Third High Court</h3>
<p>Wang Xinggao, implicated in the murder of Tang Jiapeng by Zhao Guangfu, was arrested by the French Police and handed over to the Second Special District Court. The initial trial sentenced Wang to life imprisonment. Wang appealed to the Second High Court, which overturned the original verdict and acquitted Wang. The French Police appealed to the Supreme Court, citing errors in the Second High Court's decision. Wang, eager to be released, requested bail, which was granted with guarantees from several bathhouse owners, including Ma. The Supreme Court has now sent the case back for retrial, citing errors in the original verdict and raising numerous questions. The Third High Court of Jiangsu will summon Wang and the guarantors for a retrial in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Bei Xinglou and Bei Yikun Accused of Instigating Injury</h3>

<p>Li Jinlong, a Shandong native employed as a bodyguard by the wealthy Suzhou merchant Bei Runsheng at 5 Baowanfang, Lane 25, Bellows Road in the French Concession, was promoted from a security guard and had served faithfully for ten years. This spring, he suddenly suffered a nervous breakdown and committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with his service pistol in the Bei family's garden on February 21st at 11:00 AM. The police were notified and reported the incident to the court, which sent personnel to investigate. The family collected the body for burial. Afterwards, the employer Bei Runsheng, considering Li's poor family and young children, provided a pension. Li's wife, Zhangshi (45 years old, from Jinan, residing at 38 Daode Lane, Bellows Road), attempted to request further compensation from the Bei family. On May 20th, accompanied by Li Yipeng, who had introduced Li Jinlong to the Bei family, Zhangshi went to the Bei residence to speak with one of Bei Runsheng's two sons, Bei Xinglou and Bei Yikun. They were blocked from entering by the Bei family's gatekeeper, Wang Shulu (also known as A'liu), resulting in a conflict. Subsequently, Li Zhangshi was injured. She filed a petition with the First Special District Court for a medical examination and then retained lawyer Yao Junyu to file a complaint with the Second Special District Court's criminal division, accusing Bei Xinglou, Bei Yikun, and gatekeeper Wang Shulu of jointly instigating and committing assault. She requested an investigation and also filed a civil lawsuit seeking damages of 1,567 yuan. The court accepted the complaint, and Judge Zhu Chuzhe convened a hearing yesterday morning. Lawyer Yao Junyu represented the plaintiff, Li Zhangshi, and presented the plaintiff's case. The defendants arrived on time to await the hearing and retained three lawyers, Xue Dubi, Cao Shoulin, and Hua Jun, for their defense. The court noted that the plaintiff was absent and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Printing Shop Owner Detained for Assaulting Apprentices</h3>
<p>Two Brothers Tied Up and Beaten with Sticks; Police Investigate Zou for Other Cases</p>
<p>Zou Jiarui, a native of Nanjing, runs the Da Wuwei Printing Shop at 523 Kang Nao Road. He hired two brothers from Zhenjiang, Bao Ziqiang (20 years old) and Bao Zian (16 years old), as apprentices for two years. However, Zou is known for his violent temper and often treats the Bao brothers poorly. For slight offenses, he resorts to beatings. On the 14th of this month, Zou accused the Bao brothers of stealing his leather shoes and severely beat them. Bao's aunt learned of the incident and reported it to the police. However, she only requested that the police issue a warning and did not wish to pursue the matter further. On the afternoon of the 16th, the police sent detectives to the Da Wuwei Printing Shop to warn Zou and order him not to abuse the apprentices again. Zou appeared to comply, but after the detectives left, he became angry with the Bao brothers for reporting him to the police. At 11:30 PM that night, he tied the Bao brothers' hands behind their backs in the shop and beat them severely with wooden sticks, causing injuries to their heads, shoulders, and legs. After two hours of being tied up, they were untied and forced to write a statement declaring that they had misbehaved and that the shop owner Zou Jiarui had not abused them. Afterwards, the Bao brothers were released. Later, Bao Ziqiang reported the incident to the Gordon Road Police Station. Detective Lu Di was dispatched to arrest Zou and detain him. The Bao brothers were sent to Baolong Hospital for examination, which confirmed their injuries. Yesterday morning, Zou was brought before the Eighth Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a public prosecution for the crimes of obstruction of justice under Articles 302 and 304 of the Criminal Code and presented the details of the case. He stated that the police had determined that Zou Jiarui was a known rogue with considerable influence in the western district of Shanghai. He had been previously punished twice for theft and gambling. He requested a postponement of the hearing to investigate whether Zou had committed other crimes, such as extortion. The Bao brothers testified that Zou had repeatedly abused them and that they had been tied up, beaten, and forced to write a statement. They requested that he be punished. When questioned, the defendant admitted to the beatings but denied tying them up. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the evidence and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody. The hearing was rescheduled for the morning of the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3>Unsuccessful Marriage Proposal to Female Worker Leads to Panic Over a Love Affair</h3>
<p>The Court Concludes the Hearing, Sentencing Scheduled for the 21st</p>
<p>Wang Wumei, a 24-year-old local female worker at the Shenxin Cotton Mill, residing at 1760 Bailinan Road in the western district of Shanghai, is known for her beauty and fashionable attire. She would be mistaken for a lady of high society if she were to wander around the concessions. Lu Qingda, a 24-year-old male worker from Changzhou, who is still unmarried and self-admiring, became infatuated with her. The two became intimate, and Lu Qingda's affection for Wang Wumei grew to the point that he could not live without her. He assumed that they were destined to be together. He asked his sister, Wu Lushi (28 years old, also a factory worker), to propose marriage to Wang Wumei on the 30th of last month. Unexpectedly, Wang Wumei rejected Lu Qingda, stating that he was not qualified to be her life partner. The intimate relationship between the two also ended. Lu, feeling betrayed by a heartless woman, became resentful and threatened to disfigure her face with acid to force her to submit. Fearing for her safety and angered by his unfaithfulness, Wang Wumei reported Lu Qingda and his sister Wu Lushi to the local court on the 6th of this month. Prosecutor Kong Xianglin investigated the case. Lu Qingda and Wu Lushi admitted to proposing marriage to Wang Wumei but denied making any threats. However, Wang Wumei insisted that they had threatened her. Therefore, they were publicly prosecuted for the crime under Article 305 of the Criminal Code. Judge Bai Dongling convened a hearing yesterday. The defendants retained lawyer Hu Yuanjun for their defense, arguing that people in love would not resort to threats and that there was no evidence to support the accusation. When questioned by the court, Lu Qingda admitted to having been in a room with Wang Wumei once, but denied making any threats. He stated that Wang Wumei did not love him and was biting him out of spite, which was heartless. Wu Lushi testified that she was Lu Qingda's sister and that she only asked Wang Wumei to marry her brother because they were in love. She only went to Wang's house once to propose, and when the proposal failed, she did not make any threats. Wang Wumei testified that she had been in a room with Lu Qingda once, but that it was just a joke. She said she did not want to marry him, but that he insisted and asked his sister Wu Lushi to pressure her. She said that she refused, and then Lu threatened to harm her with acid if she did not marry him. She learned of this from others and, being a young woman, she was afraid and reported the incident to the police. Her testimony was candid and unashamed. Lu appeared remorseful and regretful for taking advantage of her. The court ruled that the hearing was concluded and that sentencing would take place on the 21st.</p>

<h3>Filing a Lawsuit to Break an Engagement and Seeking to Extort Money from a Chongqing Girl - Once Feared Man Took Ms. Xu as Concubine Due to Wife's Infertility - No Sign of Pregnancy When Relationship Ended - Xu Xueqing Denies Being Concubine, Demands Support</h3>
<p>Zeng Weiren (also named Guangcai, age 36), a native of Xinghua, Hunan, residing at No. 70 Siming Lane, Avenue Joffre, currently employed at the Jianghai Customs, had worked at the Chongqing Customs Finance Office in Sichuan for over ten years. He was transferred to the Shanghai Customs two years ago. On November 11, 1934, while in Chongqing, he married Xu Xueqing (age 17 this year), a woman from Chongqing, through matchmakers Tong Zhongxin, an employee of the Chongqing Customs, and Chen Yiliang, an employee of the Chongqing China Bank, and they lived together. When Zeng was transferred to Shanghai, he left Xu in Chongqing, providing her with 700 yuan for expenses. Subsequently, Xu Xueqing, claiming that Zeng had become incommunicado after his transfer to Shanghai, came to Shanghai in August of last year to find him. At the time, she was already several months pregnant. As her due date approached, Zeng sent her to Cihui Hospital at the intersection of Route Ghisi and Rue Bourgeat to await childbirth. After the delivery, Xu Xueqing, feeling abandoned by Zeng, and unable to resolve the matter through negotiation, filed a private prosecution with the Special No. 2 Court a month ago, accusing Zeng of abandonment. Because the lawsuit stated that Xu Xueqing had married Zeng as a secondary wife, the court dismissed the case after summoning witnesses, deeming it procedurally incorrect. Now, Zeng Weiren, represented by his lawyer, has filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Xu Xueqing and her mother, Xu Wu, (currently residing at Datong Apartment, Rue Pelliot) of false accusation and attempted extortion, requesting a legal investigation. Upon receiving the lawsuit, the court, yesterday presided over by Judge Sun Pengxian, summoned witnesses for a hearing. The plaintiff, Zeng Weiren, arrived with his lawyer, stating that previously, because his wife was infertile, he had taken Xu Xueqing as a concubine in Chongqing. Because she was not accustomed to staying at home and often went out, he had her sign an agreement through a lawyer to abide by family rules. Later, when he was transferred to Shanghai, she refused to accompany him, so they ended their relationship, and he gave her 700 yuan. Last year, she suddenly came to Shanghai, claiming to be pregnant, but at the time of their separation, there was no sign of pregnancy. After arriving in Shanghai, she claimed to be pregnant, but he could not confirm that the child was his. Nevertheless, he sent her to a hospital to give birth. The child was stillborn. Later, he bought her a boat ticket, provided expenses, and sent her back to Sichuan. Beforehand, they had signed a contract at the lawyer's office. Now, she has come to Shanghai again to make trouble, demanding that he support her for life. Zeng reported the matter to the police. Later, they filed a lawsuit against him, attempting to extort money and falsely accuse him. He requested an investigation and submitted two copies of the contract as evidence. When questioned, Xu Xueqing denied marrying Zeng as a concubine, saying that initially, it was said to be a down payment for a house. The judge also questioned Xu's mother, Xu Wu, once. Due to insufficient witnesses and the need for further investigation, the case was adjourned, and a new hearing was scheduled.</p>
<h3>Wang Heying Sues Zou Zhihao, Hope for Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Wang Sues Zou for Abandonment and Files Incidental Civil Suit - Wu Countersues Wang for False Accusation and Damage to Reputation</p>
<p>Wu Zhihao, a native of Fenghua and former manager of the Shanghai National Goods Company of the Ningbo Industrial Bank, was previously sued for abandonment and incidental civil action in the Third Special Court by Wang Heying, a woman from the same hometown, along with Shi Yuanxin. After an initial hearing and adjournment, as reported in previous newspapers, Judge Jian Zhenxian continued the hearing yesterday. The defendant, Zou Zhihao, was ill in his hometown and sent lawyer Wang Zuxun to present a defense and file a countersuit accusing Wang of false accusation and damage to reputation, stating that the plaintiff was willing to go to Ningbo for reconciliation. When questioned, the plaintiff said that someone had contacted her and that there was hope for reconciliation. The judge then told the defendant's lawyer that litigation is ultimately harmful and that he hoped for reconciliation, preferably an early resolution. The defendant's lawyer also stated that the two parties had only lived together for a year and had separated, with a handwritten document from the plaintiff and reports in Shanghai newspapers. However, according to the defendant, the child was not Zou's, so the separation agreement did not mention the child. Last year, the plaintiff came to the lawyer's office seeking assistance, and the defendant had provided 300 yuan, etc. The plaintiff then stated that when she signed the separation agreement, Wu Zhihao said, "You are very knowledgeable, sign it and let me see," which is why she signed it. She left in September 1934 and received temporary living expenses of 300 yuan from lawyer Wang last year, etc. At this point, the court adjourned for three weeks, hoping the parties could reconcile outside of court.</p>
<h3>Wang Wenyao Murder Case</h3>
<p>Two Fugitives Arrested</p>
<p>On the night of March 21, 1935, at 7:00 PM, Wang Wenyao, an Anhui native who owned a "tiger stove" (water boiler) business, was brutally attacked with axes by a group of thugs at the entrance of his residence at No. 208 Longhua Road, South Shanghai, due to jealousy from competitors, and died from his injuries at the scene. Last year, the police solved the case and successively arrested the murderers Wang Zuoju, Fei Dekui, Wang Xiaheshang, and others, and sent them to the court for legal action. Now, the deceased's wife, Yang, has learned that accomplices Xu Huaide (also known as Xu Dequan) and Wang Zheng Biao (i.e., Wang Xiaoguanggun), were hiding at No. 45 Zhoufu Lane, Kangqu Road, South Shanghai, and were evading justice. She secretly reported this to the Shanghai Police Bureau's Detective Squad. The squad leader, Liu Guangjun, led detectives and rushed to the location at 6:00 AM the day before yesterday, arresting all of them and bringing them to the bureau's Third Section for interrogation yesterday morning. They were then sent to the local court for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Special No. 1 Court Accepts Bankruptcy Case of German Resident</h3>
<p>The case involves a motion by the Belgian Banque Sino-Belge to declare the German company, Moelle &amp; Co., bankrupt with debts totaling over 80,000 yuan.</p>
<p>It is rare for Chinese courts to accept bankruptcy cases involving foreign residents. Upon investigation, Moelle &amp; Co. is operated by L.R. Moelle, a German resident in Shanghai. Their outstanding debt is as high as 80,000 yuan. The Banque Sino-Belge is the largest creditor, with over 50,000 yuan owed. The bank has filed a petition with the Special No. 1 Court, following the procedure stipulated in the Chinese bankruptcy law, to declare the German company, Moelle &amp; Co., bankrupt. The Special No. 1 Court accepted it and yesterday approved the declaration of bankruptcy for the German resident, L.E. Moeller, effective at 10:00 AM on the 10th of this month. They also appointed lawyer Liu Shifang as the bankruptcy administrator, who will be responsible for handling creditor claims starting from today. A meeting of creditors is scheduled for 9:00 AM on July 10 at No. 133 Yuanmingyuan Road. However, according to Liu's law firm, the German resident has already left Shanghai and returned to his country, and the closed Moelle &amp; Co. has no assets that can be seized, making the bankruptcy proceedings quite difficult.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Transporting Bricks Leads to Worker's Death</h3>
<p>At the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Hankou Road, old houses are currently being demolished. On the 17th of this month, at around 5:00 AM, two groups of workers, one from Jiangbei (north of the Yangtze River) and the other from Shaoxing, each consisting of seven or eight people, started a dispute over transporting bricks, leading to a brawl. Zhu Zhengui (age 29), a worker from Jiangbei, was injured, suffering a severe head injury. The General Patrol Police received a report and sent detectives to investigate. They sent Zhu to Renji Hospital for treatment and arrested three suspects, including Lu Donghai, and detained them at the police station. They were transferred to the Special No. 1 Court and detained with permission. Zhu died at 10:45 AM the day before yesterday due to the severity of his injuries. His body was taken to the mortuary on Rue Pichon for examination. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, a prosecutor from the First Special Court, arrived at the mortuary and confirmed that the body had died from a head injury sustained in the fight. The body was released to his cousin, Zhang, for burial upon signing a guarantee.</p>
<h3>Maid Terrorizes Master Out of Jilted Love; Eight Month Prison Sentence</h3>
<p>Zheng Cao, who resides at 35 North Xizang Road, employed a maid named Lou Aqiu. In March of this year, Aqiu suddenly became acquainted with Wu Deli, a Yangzhou barber who worked at No. 31 Dianqi. They met in secret at the Taian Hotel on North Xizang Road about four or five times. On the 10th of this month, Wu again asked Lou to meet, but she refused. Wu discovered that Lou had another love interest, a tailor. Wu was filled with resentment and had a fortune teller on North Suzhou Road write a letter to Lou's mistress, Zheng Cao. The letter was not signed. It stated that the writer had a relationship with Lou Aqiu, but she suddenly transferred her love to another man, so the writer planned to use a knife against her. Fearing that both families would be harmed, the writer asked that Aqiu be fired; otherwise, the recipient's husband might be accidentally injured. After receiving the letter, Mrs. Zheng reported it to the police station. An investigation revealed that Wu was responsible, and he was arrested. Yesterday, the police station lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted him in the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Court for violating Article 305 of the Criminal Law, which deals with crimes against freedom. When questioned, Wu Deli admitted to having a relationship with Lou Aqiu, but denied writing the threatening letter. After being questioned by Judge Di Fengqi, Wu Deli was immediately sentenced to eight months in prison.</p>
<h3>Preparations Underway for Establishing Mortuaries in North and South Shanghai</h3>
<p>Budget Requires Over 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The establishment of one mortuary each in the northern and southern districts of the city, for the purposes of collecting bodies and conducting examinations at any time, had previously been discussed between the Shanghai Local Court and the Municipal Police Bureau. However, the matter has been shelved since the spring of last year, as it not only faces difficulties in raising funds but also requires the cooperation of other agencies in administrative procedures. In order to concentrate personnel and financial resources, the court and bureau have convened again, together with the Municipal Health Bureau, Land Bureau, and the Zhenru Forensic Institute, to resume preparations. It has been decided that the location of the mortuaries will be selected by the Land Bureau in areas of the northern and southern districts that are convenient for transportation, and that several acres of land will be selected in the shortest possible time. The internal equipment will be the responsibility of the Health Bureau, while all equipment for examining corpses will be purchased by the Forensic Institute. Once the entire budget is prepared, it will be submitted to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Justice for approval and allocation, and a portion will be raised from charities. The total cost of the two mortuaries in the north and south is estimated to be over 100,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Foremen's Brawling Case Resolved with Fines</h3>
<p>Over 120 Defendants; Judge Orders Zhu Wengong to Pay Half the Medical Bills</p>
<p>Xie Qiaosheng, the foreman of the Texaco Oil Depot on the Gaoqiao Wharf in Pudong, had been leading eighty workers. Recently, Zhu Wengong, a Jiangbei native and the foreman of the oil depot on the Puxi Wharf, attempted to seize control. On May 31, at around 1:00 PM, he led 111 workers aboard a tugboat to the wharf to forcibly take over command of the workers, using weapons to smash four windows of the Texaco oil depot. They also injured the original workers: Chen Shilin received a head injury, Yang Heshang injured his leg, Yu Lu received a head injury, and Yao Genfu injured his leg.

All were captured and five axes and five iron rods were seized. They were transferred to the local court. Aside from the damaged property, the manager of Texaco, McCowley, stated that he would not pursue the matter. However, the injuries were prosecuted by Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu, who detained all 112 defendants. The defendants included Zhu Wengong, Shan Yazhou, Yang Dechan, Gu Musheng, Dai Dafuzi, Zhou Sentao, Gu Guanxiao, Lin Gongkun, Feng Qizhen, Deng Ximing, Qi Si, Xiao Shiying, Pei Erde, Shen Changyi, Wang San, Xu Ren, Wei Zunbao, Yang Guisheng, Shen Gongxia, Gao Zhengxin, Zhou Asan, Chen Zhongyi, Sun Furui, Chen Asan, Wang Asi, Luo Xiaosi, Zhu Xiaozhu, Geng Dada, Wang Jinzhong, Jiang Dengshan, Li Afu, Yang Mingyi, Zhang Xiaoshan, Hu Ali, Liu Xiaoerzi, Zhai Bugao, Zhang Afu, Liu Daxiaozi, Ma Changgen, Liu Guochang, Chen Shushou, Wang Afu, Mai Baolin, Ding Longbao, Gao Derong, Sun Changgen, Liu Asi, Liu Boxiong, Chen Are, Zhu Dalo, Shen Axiong, Cai Xiaolinzi, Jiang Xiaosizi, Teng Guoxiang, Guan Changgui, He Xiafu, Ouyang Zhao, Liu Chongyuan, Zhang Depeng, Yang Zhaoyu, Jiang Shuyin, Jia Youqing, Shen Jifu, Yang Yuefu, Lu Zhaoxiong, Wu Xiaochuan, Zhu Xianglian, Dai Yaohua, Li Agen, Peng Qisheng, Sun Chunfu, Wu Xiaowuzi, Cao Zhenyu, Tu Erqun, Shi Weigan, Yuan Zhengrong, Gao Xiaosanzi, Han Agen, Xu Xiangxiang, Pan Zhenglin, Zhu Wandde, Yu Dasizi, Huang Simaazi, Wang Agen, Wang Ru, Zhang Guangju, Zhu Sanmaazi, Wang Guangde, Niu Jinxiang, Ren Yuncai, Zhang Wenhui, Zhao Gui, Wang Yongen, Yu Guangquan, Zhao Jinshan, Sun Fuxi, Lai Azhong, Wu A, Zhou Yinshan, Xu Wanchao, Wang Dehong, Pan Buji, Hu Bigui, Tang Fenglou, Liu Shoucai, Zhu Yuecai, Yao Agen, Zhu Honglian, Liu Kerong, Wang Dehou, Xiao Jisheng, and Zhou Awu. Yesterday afternoon, Chen Kang and Sun Fuzhuan opened the first court session. Because there were over 110 defendants, it was a record-breaking number. The courtroom was packed, so police chief Zhang Shuping led four officers to maintain order. Judge Chen, a compassionate judge, saw this group of ignorant people, with their families at home waiting to be fed, and that the plaintiff's injuries were healing, so he addressed the 111 followers besides Zhu Wengong, saying, "You are poor people. If you don't work for one day, you don't live for one day. Now, the plaintiff's medical expenses are about 200 yuan. You will share it together, which is less than two yuan per person. If you are willing, you can be bailed out immediately." The defendants listened to the instruction and said they were willing. The judge then asked the victims if they were also willing, and they said yes. The judge then brought Zhu Wengong to the case, first giving a warning, and then said that the plaintiff could now withdraw the case, but the loss fee was 200 yuan. As the main offender, he was to pay half, 100 yuan, and the remaining 100 yuan was to be shared by the others, because there were many people involved and some may have been wrongly accused. Zhu Wengong agreed. So, the plaintiff withdrew the case. The defendants who had lawyers, 52 in total, were taken out under the responsibility of the defense lawyers Zhang Jie, Xu Yinhan, and Lu Songya. The rest were told to provide bail at any time.</p>
<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A (29)</h3>
<p>Q: Mr. Cao Guangbiao of Nanjing wrote, "I sent several pieces of clothing and a few dozen scenic photos from Tianjin to Nanchong, Sichuan, in two packages through the post office. However, the recipient has not received them yet. I don't know why. This seems to be contrary to the post office's principle of secure and speedy delivery. If the items are lost, is the post office responsible? Can the sender be notified of the loss? If I want to inquire, should I inquire at the original post office or the destination post office?"</p>
<p>A: Small parcel mail is a delivery method for small, scattered items, delivered together with letters. Each item is limited to one kilogram in weight. See the Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A in Issue 22 of this newspaper for details. Judging by the quantity of items sent, it seems that you were sending parcels, not small parcel mail. If they have not arrived for a long time, it may be due to postal congestion, a stopover in transit, or other reasons. You can apply for a check with the following items: 1. Type of mailing (e.g., registered letter, express registered letter, ordinary letter, ordinary parcel, insured parcel, etc.), 2. Post office reference number (refers to the number on the post office receipt), 3. Date and place of mailing, 4. Names and addresses of sender and recipient, together with the post office receipt and a search fee of 16 cents per item. Send a letter to the original post office to investigate. If you paid a registration return receipt fee when mailing (i.e., an additional 8 cents on top of the parcel fee so that the destination post office could collect a receipt prepared by the post office from the recipient when delivering the parcel and send it back to the sender for safekeeping; this receipt is called a return receipt by the post office), you do not need to pay a search fee. Also, if the search reveals the cause of the error and the post office is responsible, the search fee will be refunded in full.</p>
<p>After receiving your letter, the original post office will forward the above details and issue an inquiry form to the post offices along the way for investigation. If it is found that the item was delivered to the recipient on a certain date, the recipient will be asked to provide a receipt (i.e., acknowledgement) and send it to you for verification. If it is found that it has been lost, the details of the loss will be sent back to you. If the cause of the loss is not due to one of the following reasons: 1. Loss caused by the nature or defects of the item, 2. Loss caused by natural disasters or other force majeure events, 3. Loss caused by the item being contraband or violating postal regulations, you can apply to the post office for compensation. The compensation amount is no more than 5 yuan in national currency for items weighing less than 10 kilograms, and no more than 10 yuan in national currency for items weighing more than 10 kilograms. If the actual price of the item is less than the above-mentioned amount, compensation should be based on the actual price. The method of estimating the actual price is based on the market price of the item in the original place of mailing at the time of mailing.</p>

<h3>Successful Experiment of New Tonic Product: Soy Milk Powder</h3>
<p>Ministry Approves Exclusive Patent for Five Years</p>
<p>Chemical engineer Bao Youxin and mechanical engineer Zhang Bingju, noting that the common soy milk sold on the market has reduced effectiveness due to the high heat during the manufacturing process which reduces the protein and vitamins, and that it is inconvenient to carry, jointly invented a type of soy milk powder. Its effectiveness is equivalent to cow's milk or cod liver oil, but the price is only one-fourth of that of cow's milk. After five years of experimentation, it has now been successfully tested and has been approved by the Ministry for an exclusive patent of five years. They have already begun raising funds and will soon be able to mass-produce it for sale both domestically and abroad.</p>
