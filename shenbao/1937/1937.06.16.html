<p>增加學問精神愉快</p>
<p>去年新運總會組織大學生暑期農村服務團目的是要使現在在校的學生利用他們的假期去認識農村、和體騐現在農村崩潰實在的情形、鼓勵他們下鄉服務的精神、調查現在破產的農村和農民、使能設法救濟、當時參加的有中央政治學校全體學生不計外、其他另外的十四個學校、也有六十六位同學、參加的人數雖然不多。可是他們在酷熱天氣苦幹的精神、已經博得農民不少的信仰、引起袖手旁觀的智識份子莫大的慚愧就是在實際上、他們對於農村衛生社曾調查平民教育等等方面也有相當的收穫他們做完了工作都該祥細的把經過的情形向總會報告我們看見所有報告也感覺到很大的與奮、有許多醫學校的學生帶着藥箱和宣傳品、到農村去做了不少實際工作、有許多學經濟政治的學生、去年不但做了服務的工作、並且得到了許多書本上所得不到的學問、此外學習各種不同科事的學生、都感覺到農村是他們最好的試騐室我們深信我們中國的農村、是有辦法救濟的、雖然目前有許多困難、可是找們榮深的感覺到。如果大家都肯盡自己的本分、不管困難是怎麼多、不管困難是怎麼大困難總有被我們志氣克服的一天、去年暑期農村服務團工作的結果、眞是增加我們不少的勇氣、不少的希望今年暑假又快到了、新運總會早就已經積極的籌備第二次大中學生暑期農村服務工作、憑去年的經騐、這次籌備一定更進步一點、計劃也一定更週密了、各位如果感覺到農村服務的重要、應該馬上毫無遲疑地參加這個工作、一定不會徒然白費了一個暑假四五十天寶貴的光陰到結果的時候、精神上會得到很大的愉快、各位祇要看看去年農村服務人員的報告、就可以知道我說的是千眞萬確了、也許有些學生離開農村太久、或是完全沒有到過農村去、不知道農村的情形是怎樣有點不敢參加服務的工作、我們中國農村總要佔了十分之九、所以我們要知道中國眞實的情形、正要乘機去看農村到底是怎麼的樣子、而且農民的忠實可愛很能夠引起我們服務的精神、農村也許骯髒一點、可是農民內心的沾潔、會令我們忘却一切外表的不如意、去年的農村服務人員、都和農民發生很好的感情、臨別的時候、大家還都依戀不捨、所以你們祇管到農村去到了那裏、你們就會覺得好像回到家裏樣的歡樂、並且新運總會已經編好一本農村服務辦法、一本日期農村服務手册你們就可以此為根據去做、這兩本書裏面不但寫了許多方案、並且把許多疑難問題都替你們一件件的想出了解决的辦法、還有去年的暑期學生農村服務報告、也已經印了出來、你們大可以拿來參考參考、如果再有什麼不明白的地方、不論關於那一方面你們還可以隨時寫信詢問南京新運總會、自然有專門負責人回答你們、新運總會並且可以給你們介紹與當地的政府、和社會各界的負責人員認識、他們會給你們很大的帮助、現在你們祇回到自己生長農村裏、或是到附近的農村去、並且祇幹一兩個月簡單的工作、難道也怕什麼辛苦嗎、暑天的確悶熱難受、農村的環境的確是粗鄙簡陋、一般人認為在暑假的時候、正是納凉休息的時候、你如果叫他在那裏悶熱難受的天氣、到那麼粗鄙簡陋的農村服務、實在有點不願意不過我們中國的農村破產到這樣的田地、如果我們在閒暇的時候還不盡力去救濟他們、那末帝國主義者、直不用費一顆子彈、我們中國就會亡了、我們要認清服務農村就是救國古語說、一國家興亡、匹夫有責、我們做學生的時候、就是在準備的時候雖然還不龍拿全力到社會裹去做事、但是我們大可以乘着暑假的時候、出來幫助人民和國家、大家須知這個工作、才叫眞正救國救民的基本工作而且是救人救已的惟一途涇、</p>
<p>大學生應刻苦耐勞</p>
<p>老實說一個學生、除非有特殊的地方如果在空暇的暑假、也不肯去做那麼重要而又簡便的農村服務那也就很難希望他將來為國家出力了、農村服務利益直接可以救濟農村間接可以鍛鍊本人身體、養成刻苦耐勞的精神、無論那一個國家、要想强盛、一定先要有刻苦耐勞的人民外國大中學生、有許多在課餘的時候去作工、去演說、去掃街去、賣報去洗衣去做服務社會的工作、他們都認為很平凡、很安適的事情、我們中國的大中學生、大半是　生活舒服的、衣食住行固然要滿足他們的奢望並且還要去跳舞去賭牌、去做種種不合理的墮落的勾當所謂“畢業就是失業”的這句話、大家也都知到了、尤其是大學生是國家的智識份子、是國家的基本人物、中國有這樣多的大學生、如果眞能刻苦耐勞為社會服務、怎會不强盛呢、所以只要每個大學生人人都能參加農村服務、鍜鍊出一種刻苦耐勞的精神、這拯救危亡復與民族的責任、方能擔任起來、所以有許多靑年問我一現在暑假餘暇什麼工作、最有益於救國”、我很簡單的答復說、“救国的工作、莫過於救民、救民的工作莫過於到農村去服務了一、去年的農村服務．已經有相當的成績、希望今年有更好的效果、今後我希望全國大學生總動員皆能到農村去服務、（十五日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本經濟危機與日滿一體經濟方案</h3>
<p>— 禹</p>
<p>這幾年來。日本不斷的實行着對外擴展政策。在經濟方面更陷於殘破的境地。這是誰都知道的事實。最近這種殘破程度越發加大。幾乎有不可收拾的趨勢了。這我們從生產•貿易•物價財政等各方面可以明白地看出來。</p>
<p>第一是生產發展的不平衡性。我們固然承認近年來日本生產總指數是增大的。但所增大之絕大多數乃是軍事上的消耗品。只有破壞作用而不能再生產。至於其他一般工業生產（尤其是國民大衆的日常用品）和農業生產則不但依然處於停滯狀態。而且日益衰落。所以就實質上說來。日本生產的畸形發展。且較其他各國為甚。就整個日本經濟而言。這顯然是一種不好的現象。</p>
<p>第二是貿易入超的擴大。日本原料資源非常貧乏。跟着軍事工業的膨脹。原料輸入必然隨之增大本年一月起雖已實施強化匯兌管理限制一般物品的輸入但終究抑壓不住擴張軍備所招致的巨額的入超不得不把大量黃金運往紐約。並且實施强制的購金法。以強化黃金的集中。這種情形。在貧窮的日本。是無法支持下去的。</p>
<p>第三是物價的昂騰。預算增大•軍備擴張•入超激增•以及一般商品生產及農業生產的衰落。都互為因果。使物價日益趨於昂騰。物價昂騰的結果。不但日本當局所計劃的所謂廣義國防的經濟政策不能順利進行。而且因為國民大衆負担增加的緣故。容易引起社會的不安。這是日本經濟的致命傷。同時又可成為政治上的毒癌。是必須從速加以解救的。</p>
<p>第四是財政破綻的加大預算增加軍備擴張支出方面旣無法減少。而收入方面又太多困難金融市塲上消化公債的能力已經達到了飽和點因之續發公債不很容易。同時。由於國民大衆的貧窮。要增加稅收又有重重的掣肘。近以日本財政當局不得不陷於徬徨歧途之中。一方面要順應軍部的苛求。一方面要顧及國內實際的情形。其應付之為難可知。</p>
<p>但日本資本主義終不能坐以待斃。目前除在國內極力强化種種統制的手段外。對於國外又作積極的擴展。企圖由此而緩和上述經濟的危機。這對外擴展的主要對象。當然又是中國。十五日內閣會議所通過的“日滿一體經濟發展方案。”便是擴展政策中重要的項目。日本强佔東北雖已達五年餘之久。但因種種的掣肘。直到現在還不曾好好開發過。這次“日滿一體經濟發展方案。”是有非常重大的意義的。據說範圍很廣。鑛業重工業輕工業農業牧畜業以及交通設施等都在“一體”之列。那就是。要把我們東北的富源。盡量開發起來給日本去用。同時。又使東北作排洩日本製造品的尾閭我們曾聽到過偽滿的“產業五年計畫。”事實上這也是日本人一手包辦的。這個計畫裏所需要的資金估計為二十四萬萬圓。其中規定由日本政府滿鐵日本民間擔任的約達十七萬萬圓。可見其計畫的龐大。自然。日本國內旣是這樣貧窮。上述十七萬萬或二十四萬萬的資金。事實上是負擔不起的。結果。最後的犧牲者。主要是將加在我們東北人民的身上了。</p>
<p>要之。日本經濟是在破裂中。它正企圖犧牲中國來彌縫它自己的破裂。所謂“日滿一體經濟發展方案。”就是加强榨取東北資源的方案。對於整個中國尤其是華北不消說是有莫大的不利的我們該怎樣加以深切的注意啊。</p>

<h3>法衆院通過財政全權法案</h3>
<p>反對黨坪擊現政府失策　總理聲明維持法朗幣價</p>
<p>［巴黎］衆議院昨日開始討論財政全權法案、反對派中央共和黨黨團領袖前財畏萊諾與前國務總理佛蘭亭均曾發表演說、加以批評、旋由國務總理勃魯姆熱烈答辯、并籲請共產黨各議員賡續贊助人民陣綫政綱、素院卒以三百四十六票對二百四十七票之多數、表决通過、</p>
<p>佛蘭亭之言有曰、人民陣綫所屬各黨、過去對於凱洛•杜美格•普恩加賚三內閣所要求之財政全權、多堅决反對、卽渠本入前於一九三五年間內閣總理任內在財政上要求全權時、社會黨各議員亦曾為之阻撓、人民陣綫內閣今乃出爾反爾、據云此項全權乃用以制止投機維護法郎、詎知政府業已獲有匯兌平準基金一○、○○○、○○○、○○○法郞、安用他求、至此欵尚存若干、運用情形如何、吾人願聞其詳、又謂政府主張提高稅額暨姻草火柴售價、亦屬不當、</p>
<p>萊諾原係財政專家、其所發表之演說有云、關於提高人民購買力一層、政府業已失敗、至誘致資金返歸本國一項政策、亦未能如願以償、政府業已發行國防公債七、○○○、○○○、○○○法郎强、而財政狀况拮据如故、其故可深思矣、玆有一事、須請政府明白說明者、統制匯兌辦法是否準備實行、設若付諸賞施、則中產與勞工階級均蒙其弊、</p>
<p>勃魯姆總理當答稱、政府决定維持法郎現行比價、并不採用匯兌統制辦法、卽强制掉換公債亦决不予以施行、此項财政全權法案所由提出之故、乃因一星期來、各投機家均以政治問題為口實、而在交易所多方活動、“吾人對於操縱金融策動政治陰謀之輩、必當有以應付、”至財政困難癥結所在、乃因本國資金流出國外者、已達五○、○○○、○○○、○○○法郎之多、政府現擬提高某種稅額、并擬酌量提高工資、予以抵消、此與入民陣綫政綱正相符合、總理最後并謂、政府所提之全權法案、實卽政府所提之信任票、務望衆院賡續加以贊助云、總理演說旣舉、衆院卽停會數分鐘、迨復開時、共產黨各議員亦卽聲明接受全權法案、藉以表現人民陣綫各黨之團結精神、此項法案因而順利通過、（中央社十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］衆議院本日晚間九時半開會、嗣卽宣告休會、俾財政委員會須將該項法案審查完竣、迨至午夜十二點十五分、衆議院賡續開會、當由財政委員會報告員施米德說明政府迫於種種事故、不得不提出財政法案、藉以制止投機操縱、妨害儲蓄戶利益、並防止資金逃避外國、但財政委員會、茲已决定、限制政府行使全權之時期、至本年七月三十一日而止云云、共產黨與右派暨一部份中央派議員當均表示保留熊度、財政部長奧利沃爾乃繼起發表演說、略謂、“現內閣秉政一年以來、批發物價業已恢復正常數字、工商業營利之稅收、自六九五、○○○、○○○法郎、增至八六八、○○○、○○○法郎、一般所得稅、則自九四五、○○○、○○○法郎、增至一、三三四、○○○、○○○法郎、財政狀况良好、於此可見、然则除原來預算虧空之外、再加以鐵路虧累、與曆屆政府所舉債額數十萬萬法郎、凡此固非吾人之過也”云、（中央社十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］德國外長牛賴特、應英國政府之邀請、現定於六月二十三日來此間正式聘問、據公報所稱、屆時英德兩國外交當局不擬舉行談判、但牛賴特此來、倘能就有關英德兩國問題、尤其是西班牙問題、與英國當局交換意見、則固為一般人之所期望云、并本月初、德國軍艦開砲轟擊西班牙阿爾米利亞港之後、英國政府原擬請牛賴特卽行來英、俾謀解决西班牙海面監察艦安全保障問題、當時英法政府商得完全同意後、曾向牛賴特發出邀請書、當由牛賴特答覆、謂渠極願來英一游、情渠已有成約、當先赴巴爾幹半島各國一行、故一時不及抽身、因此乃延期至本月二十三日方能來英、據負責人士聲稱、英國政府邀請牛賴特來英事、法國政府先後均獲得通知、自不能因此認為英國政策已有變更、聞牛賴特來英之後、雙方談話當以撤退西班牙境內各外國志願兵一事為主、則以英國認定此事為歐洲目前最重要之一問題也、此外、英國內閣各閣員自亦當就英國對於各項歐洲問題之立塲、向牛賴特有所陳述、其中以洛迦諾新公約問題及西歐一般問題之解决、為尤關重要、政界人士、以為本日不列顛帝國會議閉幕之前、通過關於外交政策之報告書、其中認各項區城協定不應與國聯會盟約之原則相牴觸、此層實頗堪注意云、（中央社十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］據此間官方宣佈、德外長牛賴特訂於本月內聘問倫敦、據悉、此行月的并非在進行某種專門問題之談判、而在對於有關兩國問題、包括西班牙問題在內、交換意見、官方人士謂牛氏此行、係按照德圈一貫政策、卽與各國政治家直接會談、以促進歐洲和平是也、因此德外長此次聘英、與渠會經赴南斯拉夫保加利亞匈牙利各國之聘問、為同樣性質云、（十五日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］德國參謀總長貝克將軍今日抵此、據悉法國參謀總長蓋米林將軍曾邀請貝克將軍會晤、貝將軍業已接受、法國防部長達拉第亦將接見貝將軍云、（十六日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［柏林］乘法國達克艦訪部德國海軍根據地基爾之法國海軍官長多人、今日抵達此間、德國海軍上將電德設宴招待、并邀法國駐德大使龐賽及德國前海長皮特里等參加、席間兩國海軍將領發表演說、均望對兩國關係有以增進云、（十五日國民海通電）</p>
<h3>德意聲明重返不干涉委員會</h3>
<p>根據本月十二日協定　恢復實際監察期未定</p>
<p>［柏林］據此間權威人士稱、德國駐英大使里賓特羅甫已於今日正式通知倫敦不干涉委員會主席、謂德國依照本月十二日之協定、恢復與調整會之合作、及重行參加西班牙海岸監察、并稱意大利駐英大使亦將發表同樣宣佈、此間政界人士指陳、德國重回調整會之計劃已經實現、但其恢復實際合作之確期則尚未確定云、（十六日國民海通電）</p>
<h3>巴斯克軍死守比爾波</h3>
<p>兩軍爭奪西南山地　英艦保護撤退難民</p>
<p>安達伊　外間雖盛傳比爾波業已失守、但巴斯克軍確仍防守該城、奮死禦敵、此說已由薩拉蒙加國民軍所發表之公報徵實、公報中承認國民軍尚未能直下此爾波、巴斯克軍仍佔有該城西南之高地、國民軍飛機正在猛轟該地、又據維多利亞消息、國民軍自於星期日攻破比爾波“鐵圈防錢”後、迄今已俘敵五千人、同時、比爾波人民刻仍陸續返出、而由英軍艦保護、巴斯克政府苟遵守遷移者以婦孺老年與為質為限之約言、則英軍艦將繼續予以保護、（中央社十五日路透電）</p>
<p>維多利亞　比爾波港政府軍最後一道鐵圈防綫、係以加爾達加諾地方防務最為堅固、其地在崇山峻嶺之中形勢極為險要國民軍頃已開始向該地進攻、並不斷派遣飛機轟炸敵方陣地、但政府軍似有生力軍開到、現方負嵎頑抗、國民軍頃已在比爾波港附近、貯備大批食物、一俟攻入該港之後、卽當散給居民、連日國民軍所擭俘虜共有一萬餘名、政府軍士兵棄械來降者日以數百計云、（中央祉十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］巴斯克前綫阿根廷觀戰員某君今日自聖約輸特路斯來電、謂“予觀察前綫、見叛軍大隊、已準備妥當、一俟入城令下、隨時卽可開入比爾波、沿海一帶約有巴斯克人八千以上歸降叛軍”、並以為叛軍或將於星期三晚或星期四晨入城云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>美國鋼業工潮僵持</h3>
<p>州長調解無結果</p>
<p>［華盛頓］記者今日就詢羅斯福總統、倘主要鋼廠不充與工業組織委員會簽訂合向、是否違背華格納勞工法、總統答稱、鋼廠旣願與該會在口頭上進行集體交涉、又何以不願簽訂合同、惟總統並未指出任何鋼廠之名稱、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>哥倫布　俄亥俄州長台維今日召集鑛業代表華行會議、達四小時之久、會議畢後、共和鑛廠及楊斯頓鋼板綱管公司之代表皆稱、態度並無改變、內地鋼廠及伯利怛鋼廠則未曾出席、今日之會議雖毫無進步、然州長宣布、仍擬於本星期內召開第三次會議云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>華倫　本城共和鍊鋼公司所屬工廠罷工風潮日趨緊張、工人內部發生贊成罷工者與反劉龍工者兩派、互相鬥爭、本日自本薛文尼亞州通至共和鍊鋼公司所屬工廠之一段鐵路路軌遭罷工工人用炸藥轟燬、事前、該公司有運貨車卅五輛、甫經通過該鐵路、駛入廠內、以謀恢復工作、轟燬之後、當將路軌立卽修復、照常通電、其時雖有罷工糾察隊隊員數百人在旁怒目而視、然以軍警保護森嚴、故亦無可如何、此外、大批鑛工不屬於工業改進會者、紛紛自各地前來華倫及揚斯頓、則以掦斯頓鋼片鋼管製造公司、已宣布所屬工廠、擬於十六日起恢復工作、而由大批軍警加以保護、故此等鑛工均應募前來、代替罷工工人、以從事工作也、（中央社十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>羅馬尼亞　京城捷克國務總理霍德柴來此以後、迭與總理泰泰里斯哥外長恩多奈斯哥舉行談話、聞其談話以中歐各國經濟合作為主、霍德柴現定於明日會晤羅馬尼亞其他政界要人、然後于明日晚間、偕同羅國總理外長自此間啟程前往南斯拉夫、會晤南國總理斯多瓦的諾維區、三國總理嗣定于十七日泛舟多瑙河上、遊目聘懷、並在舟中、舉行小協商三國總理會議、屆時當年就中歐各國經濟合作問題、作更進一步之探討、此間政界人士以為、自目前德國外艮牛賴特赴南斯拉夫聘問之後、外聞對於小協商各國間之團結、頗多疑慮、預料小協商三國總理舉行會議之後、此積疑慮必可渙然冰釋也、（中央社十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>標紗回跌主因</p>
<p>照杜月笙氏商勸買賣雙方、於昨晨開拍交易時、其市價仍維持十五日前市紅牌價為標準、不得再有漲跌、詎至開盤後、各月期紗市價突趨回跌、蓋其回跌原因、據大公社記者向各方群細探詢結果、㊀國外洋花市價跌小㊁空方不願抵補、而多方大量賣出、㊂時屆夏今、天氣炎熱、棉紗銷路疲弱、此系根據國內外商情之一般實際情况所回跌、並非市塲壓低市價也、也、</p>
<p>今日恢復新交</p>

<p>當局繼續查賬</p>
<p>紗交市塲投機操縱市價暴漲風潮、業經監察院實業部、特派大員來滬澈查於前日起會同交易所監理員赴市塲、吊閱經紀人賬月清查因手續甚煩、自晨至暮、祇查竣多方經紀人六家故昨晨仍繼續澈查、下午休息、俟將多方經紀人賬目查畢後、再吊查空方經紀人賬目、將來全郃賬目查竣後、卽彙呈中央主管機關核辦、如查有操縱事實、或搗亂市塲者决嚴厲究辦云、云、</p>
<p>經紀公會之言</p>
<p>經紀人公會函紗布交易听云、逕啟者、玆准會員裕大等函開、竊此次本所風潮之起皆由賣方大批賣出、無法維待初則把持不令拍板、繼則請由地力協會杜會長出而調渟、迨旣重行拍板、費方見我買方經紀人接受調停、苦勵委託人絡續出售、乃從而肆意狂㶑、落井陷石、妄所不為、降及今日、本月期棉紗已跌為二百八十元零一角、比之八日市價狂跌十四元九角之巨、揆之现紗市價二十支金鷄三百元、除去统稅交易所市價應為二百八十九元、即其他商標棉紗價格較小、然以合交易所市價、則無一不在交易所市價以上、十三日本所理事會、為適應緊張局面停止棉紗棉花新買賣、現在緊張局勢、已成過去、倘仍繼續停止新買賣、在賣方正可肆其團結之力把持撳壓、不恤一切、買方旣無可活動、祇可生受宰割、豈得謂事理之平、抑於交易所平準市價調劑金融之旨失其效用、懇卽轉函本所理事會、卽日取消停止紗花新買賣之揭示、實深德便等因、到會准此、相應函達、卽希查照核辦為荷、</p>
<p>實部商防止法</p>
<p>南京息、實部以交易所風潮、影響市塲甚大、十六日由部長吳鼎昌、邀參事陳匪石、司長張軼歐等晤商防止辦法、聞已决定擬訂辦法施行、卽着手起草、俟草竣咨送財部同意後、卽會呈行政院核准施行、</p>

<h3>“人性”解</h3>
<p>— Ｖ</p>
<p>我們常常聽人說起“人性”這名詞，但究竟什麽是人性？又怎樣的行為，才算不違反人性呢？有時的確也很難解釋的。</p>
<p>就譬如拿眼前的例子來說吧。常州人賀世根，曾生四子，均因病夭亡。據民間的迷信，這是偷生鬼來討債。本年四月，伊女來桂，又患肺疾，這看來自然又是偷生鬼在作祟了。於是他一時情急，就將賀來桂抱至一條弄堂口，用菜刀砍死。不料却被地保沈和尚杳悉，報官檢騐，屬實，遂依刑法二七一條第一項殺人罪起訴。</p>
<p>依常理看起來，賀世根對於自己的生女，不惜親下毒手，用刀砍斃，這自然是違反人性的行為。在中國，溺嬰雖成普通的習慣，猶為法律所不許，而况將自己親生的骨肉來砍死呢？然而他那殺人的動機，却完全是由於生子不育，為要使後來者不致再夭亡，這才對於患病將死的女兒，施行着殘酷的手段的。若說人性，這裏也有着人間本來的至性存在。他不是為着個人的私利而殺人，其目的，却在於種族最高延續。從我國舊社會的習慣看，不惟男女的待遇，有所岐視，而“不孝有三，無後為大的觀念，也深植於一般民衆的心理中。由是而賀世根為着在子不育，就一时情急，將自己的生女砍斃，在這行為的底裏，難道不也存在着“人性”的伏流麽？</p>
<p>我們要相信人性的存在，但也知道牠的存在，不是一成不變的：在某種異乎尋常的境遇裏，是可以有着驚人的變革。野蠻人因生產力的薄弱，對於氏族中的年老者，要活活的處死他。但這動機，却由於生產力不足的緣故。也許有人要說，這是野蠻人的道德，到文明社會裏，就不適用了。那麼，我現在就再舉出一個文明社會中的例子罷。</p>
<p>目前四川大災荒，有些地方的婦女，帶了她的孩子，到外面去行乞，因為不能討飽肚子，就只得把孩子從半途上丟棄了。這，在紳士們的眼睛裏，怕也要成為違反人性的事件吧？</p>
<p>然而這却為眞正的人性呢！在老百姓的心裏。他只知道行心之所安，從不曉得什麼虛偽的。</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>黑人</h3>
<p>— 羅才清</p>
<p>黑種人給於我們的印象似乎是很惡劣的，就是從許多美國電影中看到的黑人，他們耳朶土穿着幾乎垂到肩頭上的大耳環，鼻子上也用一種鼻環銷着，說起話來嘰哩咕嚕，那樣子使人看了就不高興。不過他們對於他們的白種主人却是“鞠躬盡瘁死而後已”的。那種所謂探險電影之所以一攝再攝，除了“生意眼”的把握之外，宣揚他們“文明人”的特權也不無理由吧？</p>
<p>於是我想起林肯。在一七七六年美國獨立宣言宣佈了人類平等自由之旨：一八六三年林肯大總統又頒佈解放黑奴的命令；但是那傳之於史的記載，也祇是紙上的陳跡而已。黑種人至今還是白種人的“忠僕”，雖然比之“奴隸”這名稱已經動聽得多了。</p>
<p>然而，能夠做主人之“忠僕”還是黑人中的“倖運兒”，他們倒底還能和白種人站在一起嘰哩咕嚕談話。其他欲做“忠僕”而不得的，“文明法律”為他們規定了無論電車，公共汽車，都在最後劃定一“特別區城”，給黑人乘坐；卽學校，停車塲的候室中，黑人亦不得與白人雜處。在劇塲中，黑人倘闖入白人的坐席，例當被處一私刑”。</p>
<p>“私刑”是怎樣一種刑罰呢？據上月美國密蘇里州格勒那達城的電訊：此間有黑種人數名，因犯謀殺白種商人罪，被捕下獄。當有羣衆百餘人，將各該黑人自獄中刦去，處以私刑，卽將各該黑人縛之柱土，積薪以焚之。“與白人雜處”，就有處“私刑的危險，“謀殺白種人”，自然罪無恕了。</p>
<p>當這些新聞在報章上宣傳的時候，一方面果然顯示了白種人的“英武”，但是也有一部份“主張公道者”覺得抱“種族異見”不無有可議之處，昨天報上就這樣“描哭老鼠”式的美國亞拉巴馬州蒙特哥美里的電訊，謂被控於一九三一年在載貨火車侮辱兩白種女子的黑人九名，初經判處死刑，其一名巴特森者，經主張公道老訾議地方官抱種族異見，及各團體援助，於一九三六年一月經第四次覆審後，得免登電椅，改處徒刑七十五年，今日（十四日）已由最高法院批準云。在讀到這新聞的時候，起初覺得這世上還有所謂“主張公道”的人，而這“公道”又對之於黑種人的；旣而我忽然替那巴特森者佔計起年齡來了，七十五年之後，他將變成一具怎樣的怪物呢？而其他八人呢，“公道”又到那里去了？自然，我們不必再去迫究他們所搆成的罪狀，因為除了“忠僕”能在主人面前待候之外，一切其他舉動都可以被處“私刑”。侮辱白種女子，其罪狀也就非同小可</p>
<p>不過，由於梅辱女子，却想起一件事來了。是在二三星期之前，有二位“文明”水兵輪姦一嚮導员，初则强詞奪理，後由捕房派捕趕到才賠償洋數十元了事！就是作不輪姦論。輪姦大概是“侮辱女子”之尤者，那些黑人或許是沒有這樣的膽量的，但是為黑人定下若干“私刑”法律的“文明人”却就是眞正的罪犯，我們在讀到如許“文明人”對黑種人抱“種族異見”的新聞之後，也會想一想我們黃種人的命運嗎？信憑“主張公道者”的夢早就打得粉碎了，祇有做“主人”就是“法律”！</p>
<h3>苗祭</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>幾個晴天一過，太陽又發出了牠的兇殘面目，光與熱交流看令人難過，太空上萬里無雲，城垛壓住了遠山的跟麓。偶然的，除了苗婦用熟練的字句呌賣著山上的野菓，讓尖銳的調子掠過長空，這城市是根本不會有煩囂的。</p>
<p>對面，朋友公館里雇用了兩位同化了的　家苗，從雇用起，已經有五六年了。無論在裝束上以及語言上，都找不出苗人的記號。她有和善和忍耐的性格，同時也存蓄了光明的理想，她的丈夫同她的年紀差不多，逢到有什麼節令或朔望的時候，有時也領了孩子到城裏來，可是在表面上雖則已經同化了，而對於固有的語言還非常流利。</p>
<p>這兩天有點希奇，她的衣飾變了，也像其他的苗人一樣，腿上裹着很厚的綁腿，上衣能蓋在臀部以下，𩓐子上還套了三四條銀製的項圈，看樣子那分量不會很輕，映看日光燦爛奪目。照例，朋友家里做什麼點心，她是負有遞送之使命的，這天，她裝扮得很齊楚，上了樓，滿臉的高興！</p>
<p>“為什麼不去看苗祭，少爺：她也慣用開門見山的筆法，設了以後，似乎覺得並不完全，於是又補上幾句：“就在廣東街，這兩天正是熱鬧的時候。”</p>
<p>苗祭，給我們莫大的興味，為什麼要祭呢？她沒有多餘的時問來回答，忽忙地去了。隨後，我們也就趕去。不用走到那中心的所在，一進街口，人們的臉上掛了欣快的笑，層層地包圍了核心，蘆笙，笛子，鼓……相互交奏，把難得聽到的另一種調子散開，揚溢到每個角落去。</p>
<p>擠呀擠的，汗滴如許多明亮的珠子，貼在焦灼的額角，下巴。這，引不起理會，𩓐子都伸得滿長，脚尖且立着，最好能在眼上生兩雙鈎子，可以鈎着里面動作的精髓。</p>
<p>祭塲不小，這條街完全斷絕交通。參祭的苗民，男女老少俱全，衣着也光怪陸離，尤其在年靑的婦女身上，更顯得炫奇鬥艷，項圈有的竟套了幾十條，圈上還刻了許多零碎，如果估計重量，當在五六斤以上。里面好像遠擺了些什</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>麽，爲了擠着不淸楚。據説這里並不限於某一種族，凡寄居在附近的，都應該參加致祭。</p>
<p>事後，聽受雇於朋友家里的苗婦説，因爲苗人的首領落葬於此，爲了紀念他的功績，每年有三天的祀祭，就以他的誕辰做爲祀祭的日期，所以，日子是永遠不會變更的，至於首領的姓名和事蹟，因爲年代久遠，她也記不淸楚了。最後她説，我們參觀的這天，已經是末日了，要不然，又要等到再一個年度的熱天呐！</p>
<p>熱，投下了火燄，在火燄中，我們領受了偉大的盛典。</p>

He will stay in Lushan for a few more days, postponing it to around the 25th before coming to Nanjing, then transfer to Huangshan to stay for a few days, and then go to Shanghai to travel overseas. Because of his advanced age, lack of language skills, and unfamiliarity with diplomatic skills, he is ashamed of his inability to serve as a diplomat. He will take this opportunity to state this to President Chiang. Duke Konoe's cabinet was formed based on international and Japanese domestic justice, which harmonized the fluctuations in Japanese politics in a very short period of time, and I admire it very much. Foreign Minister Hirota is an old friend of mine, and I sincerely congratulate my old friend on his return to diplomacy. After taking office, he immediately declared that the three principles he had created in the past were no longer applicable due to the changing times, which proves his insight and keen vision, and he has a deeper understanding of the new China. Some say that Hirota's diplomacy is active, but I think that whether it is active or not, we should adhere to a single-minded approach. What is a single-minded approach? In my personal opinion, it is justice and sincerity. The so-called justice and sincerity are related, not separate. Sincerity without justice will certainly not work, and justice without sincerity will be difficult to approach. Only justice and sincerity can complement each other, and coordination and consultation with the spirit of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect. If we can proceed on this basis, I believe that the future of Sino-Japanese diplomacy will be harmonious. Friendly neighboring countries will also support this statement. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Serious Situation in Changsha Cotton Mill Labor Strike</h3>
<p>Authorities Expel Workers from Factory; Entire Workforce Sleeps in Open Air in Front of Provincial Government; Factory Manager Fan Shudu Has Resigned; Representatives in Beijing Petition Again</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A labor strike has occurred at the First Cotton Mill in Hunan and has lasted for almost a month. The workers are demanding the implementation of the factory law promulgated by the Central Government to improve their treatment, but the factory has refused, resulting in a strike. The factory subsequently dismissed the workers, forcing them to leave the factory. The workers, concerned about their livelihoods, remained in the factory and sent representatives to Beijing to petition, awaiting a fair resolution. According to a report from Changsha on the 15th, the Hunan Provincial Government has now dispatched a battalion of troops to forcefully evict all 3,000 workers from the factory. The workers are now gathered in the city, lying in front of the Hunan Provincial Government to petition. Having achieved no results, they vowed not to return home, so the situation has become more serious. It is feared that any unexpected events will be difficult to handle. The workers' representatives, Chen Tianzuo, and the Hunan labor representative, Li Bingqian, went to the Central Party Headquarters again on the 15th to petition. Xu Yuanda of the Central Department of Civil Training received them and told them that the Department of Civil Training had sent a letter to the Executive Yuan, ordering the relevant departments to jointly dispatch personnel to Hunan to handle the matter with the Party Headquarters, and had also ordered the Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters to consult with the Provincial Government and wait for a resolution. The workers then petitioned the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, where they were received by Tang Jianfei, Director of the Labor Department, who also said that he planned to dispatch personnel to Hunan with the Central Party Headquarters to handle the matter and had notified the Hunan Provincial Government by telegram. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>[Changsha] The strike at the Hunan Textile Mill has been delayed and unresolved. Factory Manager Fan Xindu's request for leave has been approved, and Xiao Xiang, Section Chief of the Department of Construction of the Provincial Government, has been temporarily appointed to act as factory manager. The matter of the strike has been ordered to be thoroughly investigated and submitted for approval. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>[Changsha] All the workers of the Hunan Cotton Mill petitioned on the 15th without result and slept in the open air in front of the Provincial Government that night. The military police dispatched teams to guard them, but the workers were very orderly. On the 16th, they continued to petition the provincial and municipal Party Headquarters. Li Yangxi, Director of the Department of Civil Training of the Provincial Party Headquarters, earnestly guided the workers, advising them to return to the factory to register in order to avoid sleeping in the open air without a home. Factory Manager Fan Xindu, due to the serious situation, requested to resign, which was approved by the provincial government. Xiao Xiang, Section Chief of the Department of Construction, was appointed to act as factory manager. The workers then appointed representatives to negotiate with the new manager, requesting two things: 1. Request temporary permission to return to the factory, guarantee the restoration of freedom, and be willing to strictly abide by order and wait for a resolution; 2. Request that the new manager adopt the workers' opinions on resumption of work and improvement of treatment. It is reported that the provincial government, in addition to ordering the new manager to formulate a plan, has also requested the Central Government to send personnel to resolve the matter together. All the workers will still sleep in the open air tonight. The municipal Party Headquarters and various trade unions sent food and supplies. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>What is the most effective work for national salvation during the summer vacation?</h3>
<p>President Chiang's Talk (Continued)</p>
<p>Increase Knowledge, Enjoyable Spirit</p>
<p>Last year, the New Life Movement Promotion Association organized the University Students' Summer Rural Service Corps. The purpose was to enable current students to use their vacations to understand the countryside and experience the real situation of the current rural collapse, to encourage their spirit of serving the countryside, and to investigate bankrupt rural areas and farmers so that they could find ways to provide relief. At that time, all the students of the Central Political School participated, not counting others. In addition, 66 students from 14 other schools also participated. Although the number of participants was not large, their spirit of working hard in the hot weather had won a lot of faith from the farmers, and aroused great shame among the intellectuals who stood by. In fact, they also gained considerable experience in rural health, community surveys, and mass education. After they completed their work, they should report the details of the process to the Association. We saw all the reports and felt greatly encouraged. Many medical school students took medicine chests and propaganda to the countryside and did a lot of practical work. Many students studying economics and politics not only did service work last year but also gained a lot of knowledge that they could not get from books. In addition, students studying various subjects felt that the countryside was their best laboratory. We firmly believe that our Chinese rural areas can be rescued. Although there are many difficulties at present, we deeply feel that if everyone is willing to do their part, no matter how many difficulties there are, no matter how great the difficulties are, there will always be a day when our ambition overcomes them. The result of the rural service corps' work last summer really increased our courage and hope. Summer vacation is coming soon, and the New Life Movement Promotion Association has already been actively preparing for the second summer rural service work for college and middle school students. Based on last year's experience, this preparation will definitely be more advanced, and the plan will definitely be more comprehensive. If you feel the importance of rural service, you should immediately and without hesitation participate in this work. It will definitely not be a waste of a summer vacation of forty or fifty days of precious time. In the end, you will get great pleasure in spirit. You only need to look at the reports of last year's rural service personnel to know that what I said is absolutely true. Maybe some students have been away from the countryside for too long, or have never been to the countryside at all, and don't know what the situation in the countryside is like. They are a little afraid to participate in the service work. Our Chinese rural areas account for nine-tenths of the country, so if we want to know the real situation in China, we should take this opportunity to see what the countryside is like. Moreover, the farmers' loyalty and loveliness can easily arouse our spirit of service. The countryside may be a little dirty, but the farmers' inner purity will make us forget all the external shortcomings. Last year's rural service personnel developed a very good relationship with the farmers. When they were about to leave, everyone was reluctant to part. So you just go to the countryside. When you get there, you will feel like you have returned home. Moreover, the New Life Movement Promotion Association has already compiled a rural service method and a rural service manual. You can use these as a basis for your work. These two books not only contain many plans but also solve many difficult problems for you one by one. There is also a report on the rural service of students during the summer vacation last year, which has also been printed. You can refer to it. If there is anything you don't understand, no matter which aspect it is about, you can always write to the Nanjing New Life Movement Promotion Association for inquiries. There will naturally be a person in charge to answer you. The New Life Movement Promotion Association can also introduce you to the responsible personnel of the local government and all sectors of society. They will give you great help. Now you only need to return to your own rural hometown or go to the nearby rural areas, and only do a month or two of simple work. Are you afraid of any hardship? The summer is indeed hot and uncomfortable, and the rural environment is indeed crude and simple. Most people think that the summer vacation is the time to enjoy the cool and rest. If you ask him to serve in such a hot and uncomfortable weather, in such a crude and simple rural area, he is really unwilling. However, our Chinese rural areas have gone bankrupt to such an extent. If we don't do our best to provide relief to them in our spare time, then the imperialists will not even need to spend a bullet, and our China will perish. We must recognize that serving the rural areas is saving the country. As the saying goes, "The rise and fall of a country is the responsibility of every individual." When we are students, we are preparing. Although we are not yet able to devote all our efforts to doing things in society, we can take advantage of the summer vacation to come out and help the people and the country. Everyone must know that this work is the basic work of truly saving the country and the people, and it is the only way to save people and save ourselves.</p>
<p>University students should be hard-working and bear hardships</p>
<p>To be honest, unless a student has a special place, if he is not willing to do such important and simple rural service during the free summer vacation, then it is difficult to hope that he will contribute to the country in the future. Rural service can directly relieve the rural areas and indirectly train the body and cultivate the spirit of hard work and endurance. No matter which country, if you want to be strong, you must first have hard-working and enduring people. Many foreign college and middle school students work, give speeches, sweep streets, sell newspapers, wash clothes, and do social service work in their spare time. They all think it is a very ordinary and comfortable thing. Most of our Chinese college and middle school students live comfortably. Their clothes, food, housing, and transportation must be satisfied with their extravagant desires, and they also go to dance, gamble, and do all kinds of unreasonable and decadent things. Everyone knows the saying "graduation is unemployment". Especially university students are the intellectuals of the country and the basic people of the country. If there are so many university students in China, if they can really be hard-working and serve the society, how can they not be strong? Therefore, as long as every university student can participate in rural service and cultivate a spirit of hard work and endurance, they can take on the responsibility of saving the country from danger and restoring the nation. Therefore, many young people asked me, "What work is most beneficial to saving the country during the summer vacation?" I replied very simply, "The work of saving the country is to save the people. The work of saving the people is to go to the countryside to serve." Last year's rural service has achieved considerable results. I hope this year will have better results. In the future, I hope that all university students in the country will be mobilized to serve in the rural areas. (Central News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Economic Crisis and the Japan-Manchukuo Economic Integration Plan</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>In recent years, Japan has been constantly implementing a policy of external expansion. In economic terms, it has fallen into a state of ruin. This is a well-known fact. Recently, the degree of ruin has intensified, almost to the point of being irreparable. We can clearly see this from all aspects of production, trade, prices, and finance.</p>
<p>First, the unbalanced development of production. We certainly acknowledge that the overall index of Japanese production has increased in recent years. However, the vast majority of the increase is in military consumables, which only have a destructive effect and cannot be reproduced. As for other general industrial production (especially the daily necessities of the general public) and agricultural production, they are not only still in a state of stagnation but are also declining day by day. Therefore, in essence, the abnormal development of Japanese production is even more serious than in other countries. For the entire Japanese economy, this is clearly a bad phenomenon.</p>
<p>Second, the expansion of trade deficits. Japan's raw material resources are very scarce. Following the expansion of military industries, the import of raw materials will inevitably increase. Although enhanced exchange control has been implemented since January of this year to restrict the import of general goods, it has ultimately failed to suppress the huge trade deficit caused by the expansion of armaments. A large amount of gold has had to be shipped to New York, and a mandatory gold purchase law has been implemented to strengthen the concentration of gold. This situation is unsustainable in impoverished Japan.</p>
<p>Third, the rise in prices. Increased budgets, expanded armaments, increased trade deficits, and the decline of general commodity production and agricultural production are all mutually causal. They are making prices rise day by day. As a result of rising prices, not only can the so-called economic policy of broad national defense planned by the Japanese authorities not be carried out smoothly, but also because the burden on the general public has increased, it is easy to cause social unrest. This is the fatal wound of the Japanese economy. At the same time, it can also become a political cancer that must be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Fourth, the increase in financial flaws. It is impossible to reduce expenditures on budget increases and armaments expansion, and there are too many difficulties in terms of revenue. The ability to digest public bonds in the financial market has reached saturation, so it is not easy to continue issuing public bonds. At the same time, due to the poverty of the general public, there are many constraints on increasing taxes. Recently, the Japanese financial authorities have had to fall into a state of bewilderment. On the one hand, they have to comply with the military's demands, and on the other hand, they have to take into account the actual situation in the country. The difficulty of dealing with it can be known.</p>
<p>However, Japanese capitalism cannot sit idly by and wait for death. At present, in addition to vigorously strengthening various means of control in the country, it is also actively expanding abroad, attempting to alleviate the above-mentioned economic crisis. The main target of this external expansion is, of course, China. The "Japan-Manchukuo Economic Integration Plan" passed by the Japanese cabinet meeting on the 15th is an important item in the expansion policy. Although Japan has occupied the Northeast for more than five years, it has not been properly developed until now due to various constraints. This "Japan-Manchukuo Economic Integration Plan" is of great significance. It is said that the scope is very broad. Mining, heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and transportation facilities are all included in the "integration." That is, to develop our Northeast's resources as much as possible for Japan to use. At the same time, the Northeast will also be used as a sump for discharging Japanese manufactured goods. We have heard of the "Five-Year Industrial Plan" of the puppet Manchukuo. In fact, this is also handled by the Japanese. The funds required for this plan are estimated at 2.4 billion yen. It is stipulated that the Japanese government, the South Manchuria Railway, and Japanese private companies will bear about 1.7 billion yen. It can be seen that the plan is huge. Naturally, Japan is so poor that it cannot afford the above-mentioned 1.7 billion or 2.4 billion yen in funds. As a result, the final victims will mainly be the people of our Northeast.</p>
<p>In short, the Japanese economy is in a state of rupture. It is attempting to sacrifice China to mend its own rupture. The so-called "Japan-Manchukuo Economic Integration Plan" is a plan to strengthen the exploitation of Northeast resources. For the whole of China, especially North China, it goes without saying that it is extremely unfavorable. How should we pay close attention to it?</p>
<h3>Roosevelt talks about the New Deal without forgetting the welfare of the poor</h3>
<p>Designing to increase national income; detailed methods jointly drafted by various departments</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt spoke today on the Second New Deal, saying that this large-scale social and economic plan aims to increase national wealth, so that the 30 million people who are hungry, cold, and inadequately housed can increase their income, thereby revitalizing commerce. The federal tax system does not need to be changed, and there is no intention to discriminate against the rich. The President also promised to give details in his next "fireside" broadcast speech. The details of the New Deal, increasing wages, reducing working hours, and the Social Security Act are only preliminary plans. This new plan is now being compiled by cabinet members, disaster relief personnel, and members of the National Resources Committee. It has not been stated how much the national income is expected to increase in the future. This year's total national income is estimated at 70,000,000,000 yuan, but the total amount of public debt for this fiscal year will reach 36,000,000,000 yuan. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Filipino youth unwilling to undergo military training</h3>
<p>This year's number is 25% less</p>
<p>Manila - The number of Filipino youths who registered for compulsory military training this year has decreased by 25%. U.S. Military Commissioner to the Philippines, Major General MacArthur, originally intended to form a non-Filipino national defense force before the Philippines became fully independent from the United States. He is now paying close attention to this situation. When military training was first established last year, 130,000 20-year-old youths registered for enlistment. Although the registration period this year was extended from one week to one month, the training headquarters estimates that only 100,000 people have registered as of the end of last month, a decrease of 30,000 from last year. It is found that the Philippine conscription law was formulated in accordance with MacArthur's plan to train the Philippine National Defense Force. The law stipulates that 40,000 20-year-old youths must enlist for training each year. It is expected that after ten years, the number of trainees will reach 400,000. If Filipinos who reach the age of 20 have not registered for enlistment by April 1, they will be fined 40 pesos and imprisoned for one year. Government officials claim that many people have been punished, but it has now been relaxed a little. Most of the young trainees come from rural areas and usually go barefoot. Now they have to wear leather shoes and drill for several hours every day, which is very painful. Many of the youths in long-term military training are illiterate, accounting for up to 40% to 50%. Some youths need to support their families, so economic difficulties are another reason for the decrease in the number of military training registrations. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>

<h3>French Chamber of Deputies passes financial full-power bill</h3>
<p>Opposition parties criticize the current government for mistakes; the Prime Minister declares to maintain the value of the franc</p>
<p>[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies began discussing the financial full-power bill yesterday. Former Finance Minister Leno and former Prime Minister Flandin, leaders of the Central Republican Party faction of the opposition party, both delivered speeches and criticized it. Then Prime Minister Blum made a passionate reply and appealed to the communist party members to continue to support the platform of the People's Front. The House finally passed the bill with a majority of 346 votes to 247.</p>
<p>Flandin said, "The parties belonging to the People's Front have resolutely opposed the financial full powers requested by the three cabinets of Caillaux, Doumergue, and Poincaré in the past. When I was Prime Minister in 1935, the members of the Socialist Party also obstructed me when I requested full powers in finance. The People's Front cabinet is now going back on its word, saying that this full power is to be used to stop speculation and maintain the franc. I wonder if the government has already obtained a 10,000,000,000 franc exchange equalization fund, what else is it for? How much is left of this money and how is it used? We would like to hear the details. It is also inappropriate for the government to propose raising taxes and the price of tobacco and matches."</p>
<p>Leno was originally a financial expert. In his speech, he said, "The government has failed to increase the people's purchasing power. The policy of attracting funds back to the country has also failed to achieve its wishes. The government has issued more than 7,000,000,000 francs of national defense bonds, but the financial situation is still tight. The reason for this can be deeply thought about. Now there is one thing that the government must clearly explain: Is the exchange control method ready to be implemented? If it is put into practice, both the middle class and the working class will suffer from it."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Blum replied that the government has decided to maintain the current exchange rate of the franc and will not adopt exchange control methods, nor will it forcibly exchange public bonds. The reason why this financial full-power bill was proposed is because in the past week, speculators have used political issues as an excuse and have been actively engaging in activities on the stock exchange. "We must deal with those who manipulate finance and instigate political conspiracies." The crux of the financial difficulties is that the country's funds flowing out of the country have reached as many as 50,000,000,000 francs. The government now intends to increase certain taxes and is also considering increasing wages appropriately to offset them. This is in line with the People's Front platform. The Prime Minister finally said that the full-power bill proposed by the government is actually the government's vote of confidence, and it is hoped that the House will continue to support it. After the Prime Minister's speech, the House adjourned for a few minutes. When it reopened, the members of the Communist Party also declared that they accepted the full-power bill to show the unity of the parties of the People's Front. This bill was thus passed smoothly. (Havas Electric News on the 16th by the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies met at 9:30 p.m. today and then adjourned so that the Finance Committee could complete the review of the bill. When the Chamber of Deputies resumed its meeting at 12:15 a.m., Finance Committee reporter Schmid explained that the government had to propose the financial bill due to various accidents in order to stop speculation and manipulation, harm the interests of depositors, and prevent funds from fleeing abroad. However, the Finance Committee has now decided to limit the period of the government's exercise of full power to July 31 of this year. Members of the Communist Party, the right wing, and some members of the central faction all expressed reservations. Finance Minister Olivo then gave a speech, saying, "Since the current cabinet came to power a year ago, wholesale prices have returned to normal figures, and tax revenue from industrial and commercial profits has increased from 695,000,000 francs to 868,000,000 francs. General income tax has increased from 945,000,000 francs to 1,334,000,000 francs. The financial situation is good, as can be seen from this. However, in addition to the original budget deficit, there are also railway losses and tens of billions of francs in debt incurred by previous governments, all of which are not our fault."

<h3>Japan's Expanded Production Plan May Be Difficult to Fulfill</h3>
<p>Financial Resources and Manpower Are Insufficient; Planning Board Studies Specific Plans</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government decided yesterday in a cabinet meeting to establish a comprehensive economic plan to communicate between Japan and "Manchukuo," based on the three principles of ⑴ balancing international payments, ⑵ adjusting the supply and demand of materials, and ⑶ expanding productivity, as the fundamental policy for expanding economic power. Therefore, the Planning Board has also decided to urgently contact relevant ministries to formulate its concrete plan. Hirota Koki, President of the Planning Board, convened a joint meeting with various ministries at the board at 1:00 PM today. Attendees included President Hirota and Deputy Director General Ino of the Planning Board, as well as investigation officials, Director-General Oya of the Tax Bureau and Director-General Kaji of the Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, Director-General Kojima and To of the Industrial Affairs and Mining Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and other relevant officials. President Hirota explained the government's policy on establishing financial and economic plans decided at yesterday's cabinet meeting and discussed the Planning Board's future liaison with various ministries to formulate a concrete plan for the issue. The Planning Board has not yet received the Ministry of Army's reference plan regarding national defense and industrial plans, so it will urge the ministry to submit it as soon as possible. At the same time, it will also require each ministry to formulate and submit a concrete plan and then use it as material to consult with relevant ministries. When it is deemed necessary, committees for various issues will be established to discuss in detail, or President Hirota will conduct political negotiations with relevant ministries to expedite the decision on the outline of the plan. Opinions were also exchanged at today's joint meeting regarding the above points. (Sixteenth, Dōmei News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Yesterday's cabinet resolution to implement the three principles of integrated control of the economy of Japan and "Manchukuo" has attracted close attention from all quarters. The comprehensive five-year industrial plan drafted by the Ministry of Army, which is closely related to the six-year army replenishment plan that began this year, has been submitted to the Planning Board to draft specific procedures. This plan not only includes the five-year industrial plan for Manchuria (the realization of which requires 235 million yuan), but it will also greatly increase the production capacity of the munitions industry in Japan proper and Korea. From the perspective of national defense, the increase in production capacity is extremely necessary. This industry includes iron, steel, liquid fuel, coal, copper, soda, airplanes, automobiles, locomotives, trains, aluminum, nickel, magnesium, etc. The production capacity of all of them is planned to be increased from two or three times to six or seven times. The funds required for the implementation of the entire plan are approximately 9.3 billion yuan. If this huge amount of funds is allocated within five years, it will require approximately 1.9 billion yuan annually. However, the increase in reserves in Japan's current national wealth is only 1.5 billion yuan. Under Japan's current political and economic system, whether the government has the power to mobilize all of these annual reserves to implement its plan is a major question. Even if it is possible to use these funds, there is still a huge shortfall of 400 million yuan in the annual funds required. Therefore, whether the Ministry of Army's plan is feasible is highly doubtful. The implementation of the economy and the expansion of productivity are inevitable given Japan's current situation, but any broad and feasible procedure cannot be implemented given the economic strength, financial situation, international payments, labor, and technology. Therefore, some experts are deeply worried that many points in the plan drafted by the Ministry of Army are not suitable for the actual environment. How the Planning Board will revise the plan is a very eye-catching issue. Even in terms of labor and technology alone, the implementation of the plan has encountered serious difficulties. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry stated the other day that it is currently planning to train 500,000 skilled workers for various heavy industries, but the actual procedure this year is only able to train two or three thousand workers every two years. Japan currently feels a deep lack of skilled workers. If the above-mentioned huge plan is truly implemented, it will be necessary to train at least two or three hundred thousand workers every year. Even if there is a suitable institution for training skilled workers, the time is too long, and the implementation of this plan will further oppress the people's lives. This is another extremely serious problem. Furthermore, the absorption capacity of national public bonds has shown that it has reached a saturation point. It seems that it is impossible to rely solely on issuing public bonds to raise funds, and increasing taxes again will seriously threaten the people's lives. Whether the Japanese people will decide to endure the sacrifices of individual lives like the people of Soviet Russia and Germany and devote themselves to the expansion of national defense cannot be predicted either negatively or positively. We should pay close attention to a measure stipulated in the Ministry of Army's plan to implement a compulsory labor system in the munitions industry. In short, our attention to Japan should be on the reform of the Japanese economy, not on the changes in the political situation. The former is of greater significance than the latter, not only because political trends are mostly determined by economic changes, but also because the main task of the Konoe cabinet is to reform the structure of the Japanese economy. In short, Japan's economic entry into the German path has become an inevitable trend. (Sixteenth, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The general public is now speculating about the Manchurian five-year plan and the Japanese five-year industrial plan decided by the cabinet. According to Yomiuri Shimbun, the former requires 2,350,000,000 yen, and the latter will be implemented in approximately four years, costing 6,900,000,000 yen. Minister of Commerce and Industry Yoshino told a news reporter today that it is now necessary to cultivate financial resources and manpower to increase Japan's productivity. Yoshino meant that it is now necessary to implement controlled labor and prohibit workers from transferring from one factory to another, imitating what Germany or Italy has done. According to various newspapers, the government may be planning to implement compulsory labor in accordance with the compulsory military service method. (Central News Agency, Reuters, Sixteenth)</p>

<h3>New Trends in German Diplomacy: Foreign Minister Visits Britain, Chief of Staff Visits France</h3>
<p>British and German Authorities Claim Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged; Only Seek to Remove Misunderstandings and Reach Genuine Understanding</p>
<p>[London] The public is paying great attention to the news that German Foreign Minister Neurath will come here on the 23rd of this month to visit the British government. It is heard that Neurath does not want to conduct any negotiations during this trip to Britain, but the public hopes that the British and German authorities will take this opportunity to exchange views on matters of common interest to the two countries, especially the Spanish question. Berlin has stated that Neurath's trip should not be seen as a departure from the policy of mutual proposals between Germany and Italy. All of the German Foreign Minister's actions are now being reported in detail to Italy, and the Italian government's views are completely in line with them. Germany hopes that this trip will make the European political situation more moderate. It is heard that the West European Pact is also among the matters that British Foreign Secretary Eden will discuss with Neurath after he arrives here. However, apart from clarifying the opinions of both Britain and Germany, there will be no major developments. It is now believed that the British government's attitude has not changed and still regards the conclusion of the West European Pact as the first step towards a general resolution. The Spanish question will be one of the main issues discussed by both sides. It is now hoped that after the meeting with Neurath, Germany's views on the possibility of strengthening the monitoring plan and withdrawing foreign volunteers from Spain will be understood. (Central News Agency, Reuters, Sixteenth)</p>
<p>[London] German Foreign Minister Neurath, at the invitation of the British government, is now scheduled to come here on June 23 for a formal visit. According to the communiqué, the British and German diplomatic authorities are not planning to hold negotiations at that time, but it is generally hoped that Neurath's visit here can be used to exchange views with the British authorities on issues related to Britain and Germany, especially the Spanish question. In addition, after German warships shelled the Spanish port of Almeria earlier this month, the British government originally planned to invite Neurath to come to Britain immediately to seek a solution to the issue of the safety of Spanish maritime monitoring ships. At that time, after the British and French governments reached complete agreement, they issued an invitation to Neurath. Neurath replied that he was very willing to visit Britain, but he already had an appointment to visit the Balkan Peninsula countries first, so he could not spare the time for the time being. Therefore, it was postponed until the 23rd of this month before he could come to Britain. According to responsible sources, the French government has been informed of the British government's invitation to Neurath to come to Britain, so it cannot be considered that British policy has changed as a result. It is heard that after Neurath comes to Britain, the talks between the two sides will focus on the withdrawal of all foreign volunteers from Spain, as Britain believes that this is one of the most important issues in Europe at present. In addition, the British cabinet ministers will also present Britain's position on various European issues to Neurath, among which the issue of the new Locarno Pact and the solution to general Western European issues are particularly important. Political figures believe that it is worth noting that before the closing of the British Imperial Conference today, the report on foreign policy was passed, which recognizes that the principles of various regional agreements should not contradict the principles of the League of Nations Covenant. (Central News Agency, Havas, Fifteenth)</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to an official announcement here, German Foreign Minister Neurath is scheduled to visit London this month. It is learned that the purpose of this trip is not to conduct negotiations on a specific issue, but to exchange views on issues related to both countries, including the Spanish question. Official sources said that Neurath's trip is in accordance with Germany's consistent policy of directly meeting with politicians from various countries to promote European peace. Therefore, the German Foreign Minister's visit to Britain this time is of the same nature as his visits to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Hungary. (Fifteenth, Nationalist Maritime Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Basque Army Defends Bilbao to the Death</h3>
<p>Two Armies Compete for Southwest Mountains; British Ships Protect Evacuation of Refugees</p>
<p>Andorra Although there are widespread rumors that Bilbao has fallen, the Basque army is indeed still defending the city and fighting to the death. This statement has been confirmed by a communiqué issued by the Salamanca Nationalist Army. The communiqué admits that the Nationalist Army has not yet been able to directly attack Bilbao and that the Basque army still occupies the highlands southwest of the city. Nationalist Army aircraft are heavily bombing the area. According to news from Vitoria, the Nationalist Army has captured 5,000 enemy soldiers since breaking through the "Iron Ring Defense" of Bilbao on Sunday. At the same time, the people of Bilbao are still leaving in succession, and British warships are protecting them. If the Basque government abides by the promise to limit the evacuees to women, children, and the elderly as hostages, then the British warships will continue to provide protection. (Central News Agency, Reuters, Fifteenth)</p>
<p>Vitoria The last line of defense of the Bilbao government army is most heavily fortified in the Garda Kano area. The area is located in the middle of towering mountains, and the terrain is extremely dangerous. The Nationalist Army has recently begun to attack the area and is constantly sending aircraft to bomb the enemy's positions, but it seems that reinforcements have arrived for the government army, and they are now stubbornly resisting. The Nationalist Army has recently stored a large amount of food near the port of Bilbao. As soon as it enters the port, it will be distributed to the residents. In recent days, the Nationalist Army has captured more than 10,000 prisoners in total. Hundreds of government army soldiers are abandoning their weapons and surrendering every day.

<p>Warren The strike at the Republic Steel Corporation plant in this city is becoming increasingly tense. Two factions have emerged among the workers, those who support the strike and those who oppose it, and they are fighting each other. Today, a section of the railroad track from Pennsylvania to one of the Republic Steel Corporation's plants was destroyed by striking workers with explosives. Prior to this, 35 freight cars from the company had just passed through the railroad track and entered the plant to resume work. After the destruction, the track was immediately repaired and the power was turned on as usual. Although there were hundreds of striking pickets glaring nearby, they could do nothing because of the strict protection of the military and police. In addition, a large number of miners who do not belong to the Committee for Industrial Progress have come to Warren and Youngstown from various places. Because the Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Company has announced that its plants will resume work on the 16th and will be protected by a large number of military and police, these miners have been recruited to replace the striking workers to do the work.

<h3>Famous Opium King Ye Qinghe Arrested in Fujian</h3>
<p>Evidence of Ye's Treasonous Acts Obtained; Also Trafficking Drugs and Selling Goods from a Certain Country</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence Recently, a certain number of foreign nationals have been going deep into the interior of southern Fujian, plotting wrongdoing or having ulterior motives. There must also be traitors in various places colluding with them. The crisis is latent and deeply concerning. The jurisdiction of the Heshan Special Zone is the entire Xiamen Island outside the Xiamen urban area. It was originally the interior, and foreigners or foreign nationals have no right to reside there. However, in fact, there are still thousands of foreign nationals living in Heshan, and those with clear nationalities are still easy to defend against. Those who are seemingly right but not, or seemingly not but actually are, such as bat factions or individuals with unclear nationalities, are countless and hard to guard against. Recently, such as the famous opium king Ye Qinghe, presented a petition to the Heshan Special Zone Office, requesting that the coastal area from Zhongzhai to Gangshuitou be opened as a fishing ground, and also submitted it to the provincial government for filing. This section of the coast, from Zhongzhai through Tiantou, Gaoban, Banzhi, to Hongshuitou, is more than four miles long and about one mile wide. The Special Zone Office is sending personnel to investigate. Ye was originally from Xiamen, and only last autumn did he seek to obtain Japanese citizenship in Taiwan. However, Ye's Chinese citizenship was not canceled, and he is truly a dual-national individual. He is currently serving as the general manager of the Yumin Company, which is responsible for selling opium throughout Fujian Province. The people of Heshan have questioned Ye's nationality, and the matter concerns national territory, and have jointly opposed its realization.</p>
<p>In the midst of this plot, Ye Qinghe was suddenly arrested in Fuzhou by the provincial government on the 12th. At the same time, Cheng Yunshan, Director of the Fujian Opium Suppression Inspectorate, was also detained. Ye's confidant, Yumin Company Secretary Lu, was arrested in Xiamen on the same day and sent to the province on the 13th. It is rumored that Ye and Lu were detained for smuggling and bribery. In addition, there are also acts of treason and espionage and conspiracy and reactionary relationships on the international stage. Earlier, a Taiwanese man was captured in Quanzhou ten days ago. This man served as the principal of a certain middle school in Xiamen around 1924 or 1925. Spy documents were seized, including survey forms on the donations, taxes, military affairs, and politics of southern Fujian. As a result of strict investigation, Ye was indeed involved. Furthermore, there is evidence that Ye and Lu's arrest was mainly due to this. Cheng's detention was because Lu had a close relationship with Ye Bai. The provincial government is handling this case very secretly. When the Taiwanese man was arrested, the Japanese consul in Xiamen immediately requested extradition. The Jinjiang County Government denied it. The Japanese consul then negotiated with the provincial government, which also denied arresting this person. According to custom, foreigners must obtain a travel passport from the provincial government before entering the interior, so that the government can assume the responsibility of protection. Otherwise, there is no proof and no way to negotiate. The provincial government's arrest of Ye was also very secret, wanting no one to know. However, Ye's Chinese citizenship has not been canceled, so he cannot immediately escape the sanctions of our country's laws. It is heard that this case may be sent to the capital if necessary. Ye is an internationally renowned opium king. Years ago, he escaped back to Shanghai after committing a drug case there. To this day, the Shanghai court has an arrest warrant for him. He has a great influence in Xiamen and Fuzhou and has been in charge of special goods throughout the province for many years. In society, he uses the name Ye Qinghe without hesitation, but on the documents of the Yumin Company and when obtaining Japanese citizenship, he changes his name to Ye Zhensheng to avoid the Shanghai court's arrest warrant. This person intends to do evil and is openly unashamed. Last year, he spent tens of thousands of yuan to obtain Japanese citizenship, and the Japanese side immediately used him to preside over a certain movement in southern Fujian. This spring, Ye personally went to Dalian and Tianjin to contact certain military authorities. After returning, Tianjin drugs and Rehe opium were successively transported to Xiamen. Northeast agricultural products and certain foreign goods were also dumped in southern China under Ye's direction. If something happens in Fujian one day, Ye will be the second Yin Rugeng, but his crimes are far more than that. During his tenure as the seller of special goods, he also transported a large amount of drugs. A month ago, Ye sued two Japanese people in Taiwan, accusing the two Japanese people of selling him fake morphine two years ago, delivering the goods in Xiamen, and defrauding him of 43,000 yuan. This is only exposing a part of it. This arrest is probably because he used his position to transport a large number of drugs, which is also one of them. (Fifteenth)</p>
<h3>A Certain Party Induces and Recruits Laborers, Already Transporting 240,000 People</h3>
<p>Assigned to Develop the Puppet Manchukuo and Build Roads, Over Sixty Traitorous Labor Recruiters Apprehended in Tianjin, Hebei Provincial Government Formulates Measures to Suppress Labor Recruitment</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: A certain party employs traitors to induce and recruit laborers in the inland areas of Hebei Province and the border regions of Shandong and Henan Provinces for work outside the customs. Tianjin serves as the central hub, with the so-called "entry procedures" handled by the Daito and Sanko companies in the Japanese concession of Tianjin. According to investigations, since the beginning of spring, approximately 40% of the exported workers have been transported out of the customs via the Beining Railway, and about 60% have been transshipped to Dalian by sea. Japanese ships, such as the Tsuko Maru and the Nissho Maru, have been specializing in transporting laborers in recent months. As of now, a total of 240,000 people have been transported out, still 160,000 people short of the number required by a certain party. However, recently our side has been strictly cracking down on laborers leaving the customs, and the laborers have also heard that their lives and safety are not guaranteed after leaving the customs, and many have suddenly woken up and no longer fall for the traps. Therefore, in recent days, the number of laborers leaving the customs has decreased significantly. Some traitors who recruit laborers for a certain party have gone deep into the inland areas to intensify their efforts to win over and persuade people. However, due to the accounts of hardship from laborers who escaped back from outside the customs, the news spread far and wide, and the inland workers have all come to view leaving the customs as a dangerous path. Although the traitors have exhausted their sweet words and promises of benefits, it is still difficult to achieve results. A certain party is extremely anxious about this and has now increased the recruitment reward from six yuan to eight yuan per person in order to attract more people. Furthermore, the purpose of recruiting laborers is nothing more than two points. First, to implement the "Five-Year Plan for the Development of Puppet Manchukuo Industries." This year is the first year, and there is a great need for workers in mining, gold mining, road construction, river dredging, and other projects. At least 380,000 people are required to meet the allocation needs. Therefore, in addition to employing traitors to persuade people everywhere, a certain party has also ordered Yin Ni in the counties of "Eastern Hebei" to forcibly conscript 100,000 able-bodied men for transportation to "Manchukuo" for use. Second, to build roads in the border areas of Inner Mongolia and Chahar. The plans include more than ten lines, such as the Zhanzhang (Zhanyuan to Zhangbei) and the Chao Cheng (Chaoyang to Chengde), to facilitate the transportation of troops, military supplies, and private goods. This matter also requires 120,000 people. Therefore, the total demand for laborers this year is 400,000 people. In recent months, more than sixty traitors who recruited laborers for a certain party have been arrested here and transferred to the local court by the Tianjin Municipal Police Department for investigation and prosecution according to law. The most prominent case is the Zhang Zijie case. The criminal Zhang recruited laborers for a certain country's military police to transport to Mongolia for road construction. The enticed hard laborers, such as Li Baoqing, were forced to work under the supervision of a certain country's people during the day, and at night, a certain country's people surrounded the residences with electric fences to prevent their escape. The criminal Zhang also extorted money and goods from Li Shiqing and others. One of the hard laborers, named Li Changbao, was beaten to death by a certain country's people. Li Baoqing took the opportunity to escape back to Tianjin. On April 12 of this year, Li Baoqing and the criminal Zhang coincidentally met at the Tongxing Store in Hedong, which led to the cracking of the case. The Tianjin Local Court recently sentenced the criminal Zhang to thirteen years of imprisonment for the crime of continuously and illegally depriving people of their freedom, and he has already been sent to prison for execution. Other labor recruitment traitors, such as Yang Zhongsheng, Miao Chungui, Wang Yonghe, Hu Shaotang, Shao Huating, Gao Zhenfan, Wang Dongjiang, Li Liandi, etc., have been sentenced to two or three years or three or five years of imprisonment.</p>
<p>The Hebei Provincial Government has recently formulated the Hebei Province Labor Recruitment Management Regulations to crack down on illegal labor recruitment. The full text consists of five articles and has been submitted to the Jicha Political Committee for approval, ordering all subordinate counties to comply with it and notifying the Tianjin Municipal Government for information. The original text is as follows: Article 1: Any labor recruitment offices established in the counties of this province shall submit a register containing the organization's name, location, business scope, and the name, age, and origin of the manager, obtain a reliable commercial guarantee, and obtain two telegram certifications from the responsible authorities in the work location. Only after approval by the provincial government can recruitment be conducted. Article 2: Each time the labor recruitment office recruits workers, it shall submit a draft of the recruitment area, the number of workers, the destination, the type and duration of work, and the worker's treatment (such as working hours, wages, payment procedures, round-trip travel expenses, medical subsidies for injuries and illnesses, and death benefits) to the provincial government for approval. After approval, the county governments in the recruitment area will be notified to allow them to recruit workers in accordance with the regulations. Article 3: After the labor recruitment office has recruited all the workers, it shall immediately submit a register of the workers' names, ages, and origins to the county governments in the recruitment area for record. Article 4: When the labor recruitment office violates the provisions of these regulations, the county governments in charge or in the recruitment area shall investigate and crack down on the violations separately. Article 5: If there are any matters not covered by these regulations, the provincial government may amend them at any time and implement them after they are decided by the provincial government's committee meeting.

<h3>Song Zheyuan's Reasons for Staying in His Hometown</h3>
<p>Rumors About Personnel Changes Are Untrue</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since Song Zheyuan returned to his hometown of Leling, he has stayed away for a long time, causing rumors about diplomatic issues and personnel changes here to resurface. How Pingjin feels about Song personally is little noticed. However, the rumors that Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong has expressed his passivity and will be replaced by Liu Ruming and Zhao Dengyu are more prevalent. Whether Zhang has indeed resigned has not yet been proven by facts, but Zhang's Secretary-General Ma Yanzhang has indeed resigned. When Ma Yan met with reporters last Friday, he personally revealed the news. Who will be his successor? It mostly concerns the issue of Mayor Zhang Zizhong. Song's residence in his hometown is secluded and simple, not asking about right and wrong. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, it was rumored that he would return to Ping to handle government affairs in two or three days after the festival. Judging from the current situation, the date of his return to Ping may still be pending. Since Ikeda, a staff officer of the Japanese Army Headquarters stationed in Tianjin, visited Song in Leling last week for talks, Song has made clear his intentions. The central and local policies on the economic development of North China are completely consistent. With political issues unresolved, discussions on the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway, the Tanggu Port Construction, and the Luyan Salt Improvement will be postponed. If the Japanese side shows genuine sincerity in cooperation, they can first handle the Longyan Railway. However, this matter is subject to an absolute condition: China is willing to provide the interest and manage it independently, and is unwilling for the Japanese side to join the capital and create a Sino-Japanese joint venture system. Second to this matter, cotton improvement and production, and wool improvement and breeding can be handled. If the Japanese side agrees, they can be contacted at any time, regardless of whether he returns to Ping or not, because there is a dedicated person responsible for the talks. Between the central government and Jicha, apart from those that cannot be held due to the special environment, the local authorities have recently respected the authority of the central government and have done their best to implement the laws and regulations promulgated by the government. For example, for the military training during the summer vacation, Li Wentian, the commander of the 37th Division of the 29th Army and the deputy commander of the 38th Division of the Security Army (and the Director of the Tianjin Police Bureau), was appointed as the training team leader, responsible for the centralized training of Hebei Province and Tianjin City. For example, for the election of National Assembly representatives, Hebei Province has already divided districts and is preparing, and the cities of Pingjin are also starting to work on it. In addition, all matters within the scope of the responsibilities and powers of the local authorities and without external interference are followed without violation. Therefore, considering the situation and logic, the previous two rumors about Song's delayed return to office are not entirely true. (13th)</p>

<h3>The Yarn Market Turmoil Can Be Said to Be Over, New Trading Resumes Today</h3>
<p>Both Near and Distant Futures Yarn Prices Fall Back After Yesterday's Resumption of Auction, Competent Authorities Continue to Thoroughly Investigate Accounts</p>
<p>The yarn market resumed auction yesterday morning, with both near and distant futures market prices falling back. The market situation has stabilized. The exchange will resume new trading starting today. The competent authorities are still closely investigating the accounts of brokers. Once the investigation is completed, it will be submitted to the central authorities for review. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resumption of Auction Situation</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the Brokers Association held a temporary meeting of its members to report the exchange's decision that if either the buyer or seller deliberately disrupts the market, their qualifications will be revoked and their business will be suspended. After the mediation of the association's directors, the exchange rang the bell and opened the auction at 10:30 AM after the meeting adjourned at 10:20 AM. When the first lot of June futures yarn was auctioned, the long side lowered the market price, and the short side did not reach out to respond. The market atmosphere went from tense to silent, lasting for ten minutes. The long side lowered the market price again to sell, so the result was that the June futures market price was auctioned at 284.10 yuan (compared to the red card market price of 287 yuan before the 15th, a drop of 6.90 yuan), the July futures were at 277.50 yuan (red card 279.50 yuan), a drop of 2.50 yuan, the August futures were at 274.50 yuan (red card 277.10 yuan), a drop of 1.60 yuan, and the September futures were at 274.20 yuan (red card 277 yuan), a drop of 2.80 yuan. The closing result was that the afternoon market opened at 1:00 PM, with the first lot (June futures) at 278 yuan, (July futures) at 275.10 yuan, (August futures) at 274 yuan, and (September futures) at 272.50 yuan. The second lot (June futures) was at 278.30 yuan, (July futures) at 275.80 yuan, (August futures) at 276.50 yuan, and (September futures) at 274 yuan. The third lot (June futures) was at 378 yuan, (July futures) at 278.40 yuan, (August futures) at 276.90 yuan, and (September futures) at 277 yuan. The fourth lot (the closing) when auctioning the June futures, the market price fell to more than 8 yuan, although the long side sold, the short side refused to cover, so it could not be auctioned and remained on the blackboard, (July futures) at 276 yuan, (August futures) at 275 yuan, and (September futures) at 275.50 yuan. In total, the total volume of yarn auctioned in the morning and afternoon yesterday reached more than 100,000 bales, of which about 30,000 bales were sold by small, scattered long side, but the number of large long side was limited.</p>
<p>Main Reasons for the Fall in Auction Prices</p>
<p>According to Mr. Du Yuesheng's advice to buyers and sellers, when trading at the opening yesterday morning, the market price should still maintain the red card price of the 15th as the standard and should not rise or fall again. However, the market price of yarn futures for each month suddenly fell back after the opening. According to the Great Public News reporter's detailed inquiries from all parties, the reasons for the fall are that (1) the market price of foreign cotton fell slightly, (2) the short side was unwilling to cover, and the long side sold in large quantities, (3) the summer is here, the weather is hot, and cotton yarn sales are weak. This fall is based on the general actual situation of domestic and foreign business conditions, and it is not the market suppressing the market price.</p>
<p>New Trading Resumes Today</p>
<p>The market is scheduled to resume new trading starting today. The announcements are recorded as follows: (Announcement No. 2019) New trading of cotton and cotton yarn will resume from the 17th. In addition to filing with the ministry for record and notifying the Brokers Association, this is hereby announced. (Announcement No. 2020) Starting from June 17, the special margin for new trading of cotton futures for each month made by various brokers will be re-stipulated as follows: June futures will be charged 9 yuan in cash per dan, July futures 6 yuan, August and September futures 6 yuan. New two-deposit accounts will be charged to both parties. In addition to notifying the Brokers Association, this is hereby announced. (Announcement No. 2021) Starting from June 17, in addition to the basic margin and special margin for new trading of cotton yarn futures made by each broker, a pre-paid margin of 50 yuan in cash per bale will be charged. New two-deposit accounts will be charged to both parties. In addition to notifying the Brokers Association, this is hereby announced. (Announcement No. 2022) Starting from the 17th, the special margin for large-scale trading of cotton and yarn made by brokers will be charged to one party according to the fixed rate of Announcement No. 1971. In addition to notifying the Brokers Association, this is hereby announced.</p>
<p>Authorities Continue to Investigate Accounts</p>
<p>The speculative manipulation of market prices and the surge in prices in the yarn market has been thoroughly investigated by the Supervisory Yuan and the Ministry of Industry, which sent special officials to Shanghai. Since the day before yesterday, they have been working with the exchange supervisors to go to the market to review the monthly accounts of brokers. Because the procedures are very complicated, only six long brokers have been investigated from morning to night. Therefore, the investigation continued yesterday morning, and they rested in the afternoon. After the accounts of the long brokers have been investigated, the accounts of the short brokers will be investigated. In the future, after all the accounts have been investigated, they will be submitted to the central competent authorities for review. If any manipulation or disruption of the market is found, it will be severely investigated and dealt with.</p>
<p>The Brokerage Association's Statement</p>
<p>The Brokerage Association sent a letter to the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, saying, "To Whom It May Concern: Herewith is a letter from our members Yuda et al., stating that the recent turmoil in the exchange was caused by the sellers selling in large quantities, which could not be maintained. At first, they refused to allow the auction, and then they asked Chairman Du of the Local Forces Association to mediate. When the auction was resumed, the buyers saw that our buying brokers accepted the mediation, and they encouraged the principals to continue selling, so they wantonly lowered the price and took advantage of the situation. As of today, the price of cotton yarn for this month has fallen to 280.10 yuan, a huge drop of 14.90 yuan compared to the market price on the 8th. Considering that the spot price of 20-count Golden Rooster is 300 yuan, after deducting the unified tax and exchange market price, it should be 289 yuan. Even if the prices of other brands of cotton yarn are lower, they are all above the exchange market price. On the 13th, the council of the exchange stopped new trading of cotton yarn and cotton to cope with the tense situation. Now that the tense situation has passed, if the new trading is still stopped, the sellers can use their united strength to hold down and suppress the price at all costs. The buyers have no activity and can only be slaughtered. How can this be said to be fair? And the purpose of the exchange to stabilize the market price and regulate finance will lose its effect. We urge you to forward this letter to the council of the exchange immediately to cancel the announcement to stop new trading of yarn and cotton. We would be deeply grateful."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry Discusses Prevention Methods</p>
<p>Nanjing News: The Ministry of Industry believes that the exchange turmoil has a great impact on the market. On the 16th, Minister Wu Dingchang invited counselors Chen Feishi and Director Zhang Yizhou to discuss prevention methods. It is heard that it has been decided to formulate and implement prevention methods, which will be drafted immediately. After the draft is completed, it will be sent to the Ministry of Finance for approval, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reported that the Jardine Matheson vessel Jih Wo, which departed from Shanghai to Hankou on the 14th, hit a reef about 60 miles from the Wusong Estuary at midnight.

<h3>Merchant Steam Navigation Bureau Marine Engineers Request Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>Five Demands Submitted; Request the Marine Engineers Association to Negotiate</p>
<p>Since Cai Zhenshen took office as General Manager and Shen Zhongyi as Deputy General Manager of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, they have reorganized various aspects such as business and pier management, with considerable success. However, there has been no practical improvement in the treatment of crew members. For example, the treatment of marine engineers has not been improved, and recently only the salaries of captains have been increased, while the salaries of other crew members have not been increased, which is unfair. All the marine engineers of the bureau have repeatedly appealed for improvement. Recently, they also requested the China Marine Engineers Association to forward a letter to the bureau to negotiate the five demands they put forward, which are extracted as follows: ① Increase treatment: (A) Chief Engineer: starting salary of 250 yuan, with an increase of 20 yuan after one year of service, 40 yuan after two years, and then a yearly increase, not exceeding the captain's salary; (B) First Assistant Engineer: starting salary of 170 yuan, with an increase of 15 yuan after one year of service, 30 yuan after two years, and then a yearly increase, not exceeding the chief engineer's starting salary; (C) Second Assistant Engineer: starting salary of 120 yuan, with an increase of 10 yuan after one year of service, 20 yuan after two years, and then a yearly increase, not exceeding the first assistant engineer's starting salary; (D) Third Assistant Engineer: starting salary of 90 yuan, with an increase of 5 yuan after one year of service, 10 yuan after two years, and then a yearly increase, not exceeding the second assistant engineer's starting salary; ② Please add salary for Sundays and public holidays; ③ There must be one month of rest every year, and salary should be paid during the rest period. Those who voluntarily do not rest should be paid extra salary; ④ The marine engineers' food should be the same as the captain's; ⑤ Marine engineers should not be dismissed without reason.</p>
<h3>Chen Tiesheng Arrives in Hankou Yesterday by Plane</h3>
<p>Continues to Fly to Chongqing This Morning</p>
<p>Chen Tiesheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Child Welfare Association, took the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Chongqing flight to Sichuan yesterday morning at 7:00 AM to inspect the actual situation in the disaster area and handle the resettlement of disaster-stricken children.

According to news from the Child Welfare Association, they received a telegram from Chen in Hankou yesterday afternoon, stating that the plane was stopped in Hankou due to weather conditions and was preparing to continue flying to Chongqing this morning (the 17th) to contact various parties to handle the resettlement of disaster-stricken children.</p>
<h3>Traffic, Jiangsu, and Agricultural Banks Jointly Form a Native Cloth Loan Syndicate</h3>
<p>The Exact Amount of Investment Has Not Yet Been Decided; Commissioner Ge from Nantong Will Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>In Nantong counties of Jiangsu Province, farmers rely solely on native cloth as a sideline occupation. Now, for the sake of development, leaders of the official and business sectors of the county, in addition to jointly uniting with industrial and financial circles to organize the Nantong Native Cloth Improvement Association and formulating a three-year improvement plan, Commissioner Ge from the administrative supervision office of the district will come to Shanghai to contact the Shanghai banking community to organize a "Native Cloth Syndicate" to invest in the sideline occupation of Nantong farmers. According to the reporter of the Shenzhou News Agency, who inquired about the matter from the financial community of this city yesterday, the syndicate will be jointly formed by the Traffic Bank, Jiangsu Bank, and Jiangsu Farmers Bank, and will be led by the Traffic Bank. Because the above three banks have been most active in promoting rural sideline occupations in Jiangsu Province, the initial loan method has been approved by the board of directors of the Traffic Bank and a decision to proceed has been made. What is now awaiting negotiation is the entire method and the detailed rules for extending loans, so Commissioner Ge will come to Shanghai again in the next few days to discuss the matter. It is said that the exact amount of investment has not yet been decided when it starts, but the banks are very enthusiastic about promoting native cloth, and it is possible to expand to one million or more. According to relevant parties, promoting native cloth means developing household industries and rural sideline occupations, and the mission is extremely important. However, these sideline occupations are all legacies of patriarchal society, and it is more difficult to implement reforms. For example, it is not easy to make old-fashioned things conform to the new style in an instant. Therefore, for the sake of developing the countryside, the banking community has decided to proceed with the native cloth syndicate, and will conduct thorough research and implementation of all methods to seek development and improvement.</p>
<h3>Representatives from All Walks of Life Held a Memorial Ceremony for the Premier's Ordeal in Guangzhou Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Entire City Flew Flags in Commemoration</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 16th) was the 15th anniversary of the Premier's ordeal in Guangzhou. The city party headquarters specially convened representatives from all walks of life at 10:00 AM yesterday morning in the auditorium of the headquarters to hold a memorial meeting, with Pan Gongzhan as the chairman, Du Mengsen as the recorder, and Zhang Hanyun as the master of ceremonies. All agencies, organizations, schools, party headquarters at all levels, and households in the city flew flags in commemoration. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Attending the Meeting</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan from the city party headquarters, Lou Zhaoding from the Bureau of Navigation Affairs, Huang Zaoxiong from the Education Association, Lin Kecong from the Women's Association, Huang Xianggu from the French Concession Taxpayers Association, Hu Tianzeng from the New Life Movement Association, Du Mengsen from the Cooperative Undertakings Promotion Association, Zhang Yichen from the First Special District Citizens' Association, Gong Jingyan from the Second Special District Citizens' Association, Hu Shouqi from the South District Citizens' Association, Zhu Shide from the National Products Sustaining Association, Zhang Sheng from the Agricultural and Industrial Life Improvement Society, Ma Hanfeng from the Labor Education Association, Zhao Zhenhui from the Pharmaceutical Workers Union, Yu Yaoqiu from the Baoshan Fellow Villagers Association, and more than 200 representatives from the local court, Wuben Girls' High School, Minli Girls' High School, New Asia High School, and various agencies, organizations, schools, and party headquarters at all levels.</p>
<p>Meeting Order</p>
<p>① All stand at attention; ② Sing the party song; ③ Pay the highest respect to the party and national flag and the Premier's portrait; ④ Read the Premier's will; ⑤ Silent tribute; ⑥ Report; ⑦ Speech; ⑧ Slogans; ⑨ Adjournment;</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremonial procedures, Chairman Pan Gongzhan gave a report, stating that the Premier's life experience, the blows he suffered to the revolution, were no less than ten times. After the Xinhai Revolution, he thought that the Republic of China had been established, but who knew that Yuan Shikai would restore the imperial system, Zhang Xun would attempt restoration, warlords would divide the country, and internal unrest would not subside, leaving only the name of the Republic of China. Therefore, the Premier advocated the establishment of a truly Three People's Principles republic, which must defeat the warlords and imperialism, otherwise the revolution would not succeed. Therefore, the Premier established a revolutionary government in Guangzhou, but unexpectedly, just as he was deploying the Northern Expedition, the troops all departed for the Guangxi-Hunan front, entrusting the important task of the rear to Chen Jiongming. At this time, Chen colluded with Wu Peifu and brewed a rebellion. The Premier received the news, returned to Guangdong to take charge, and changed course to the Northern Expedition. Chen fled to Huizhou, expressing opposition. The Premier then removed him from the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, hoping for his repentance. At that time, there were not many troops stationed in the suburbs of Guangzhou. Chen took the opportunity to incite rebellion. The Premier initially did not believe it, and when it was confirmed, he was still unwilling to leave the Presidential Palace. Later, at the request of his comrades, he boarded the Yongfeng warship in Baietan to mobilize troops to suppress the rebellion, waiting for two months, firmly maintaining discipline, regulations and prestige. We have recently read Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Half-Month Record of the Xi'an Incident. Last year's Xi'an Incident was completely similar to the Premier's ordeal in Guangzhou. Being able to face great difficulties and not be coerced into submission requires cultivation in ordinary times, which is easy to achieve. When the Premier suffered in Guangzhou, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also personally followed and was inspired by the Premier's great spirit to maintain discipline and justice in the face of this great difficulty. This kind of fearless spirit is truly a model for revolutionary comrades. Therefore, we feel the necessity of cultivation in ordinary times, and hope that our party comrades will work together to complete the revolution, etc. Then he shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans</p>
<p>① Emulate the Premier's revolutionary spirit; ② Rectify party discipline and strengthen the organization; ③ Unite sincerely and jointly meet the national crisis; ④ Support the leader and consolidate the central government; ⑤ Promote production and construction; ⑥ Long live the Three People's Principles; ⑦ Long live the Kuomintang; ⑧ Long live the Republic of China;</p>
<p>Other Organizations</p>
<p>The Special Party Department of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway convened more than 100 party members from the Railway Bureau, various workers' organizations, workers' schools, Rotary elementary schools, and the party headquarters of the first district under its jurisdiction yesterday to hold a memorial meeting for the Premier's ordeal in Guangzhou. Chen Chengshi presided over the meeting and reported on the historical summary of the Premier's ordeal in Guangzhou and commemorative thoughts, followed by a speech by Ying Shouzhi, and then shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting. Also, the Special Party Department of the Chinese Seamen of the Kuomintang held a memorial meeting for the Premier's ordeal in Guangzhou at 10:00 AM yesterday morning in the auditorium of the headquarters on Zhonghua Road, Dahanmen, with more than 200 people attending.

The propaganda section of the department also printed and distributed leaflets entitled "The Premier's Ordeal in Guangzhou is a manifestation of Fearless Spirit" and shouted slogans at the same time, adjourning the meeting at around 11:00 AM.</p>

Yesterday, the Shanghai General Bureau received a telegram from them, stating that they had weighed anchor at 8:00 AM this morning and were heading to Shanghai. It could have arrived at the port at 11:00 or 12:00 last night, but because there were still a lot of passenger luggage on the ship, it was inconvenient to dock late at night.

<h3>Zhao Daiwen Telegraphs Jin Province Disaster Situation</h3>
<p>Selling Wives and Children, Receiving Permits to Flee the Famine</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association received a telegram from Zhao Daiwen, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, which said (briefly): "I have just learned that you gentlemen have deep compassion and are concerned about those suffering from hunger and drowning. Currently, due to the disasters in Sichuan, Guizhou, Gansu, and Henan, you are generously providing relief. Furthermore, you are deeply concerned about the severe summer disaster in Shanxi Province. Looking from afar at your virtuous demeanor, I am filled with admiration. An investigation reveals that last spring, over thirty counties in this province were invaded and ravaged by communist bandits, resulting in families being displaced and villages becoming ruins. In areas where the bandits did not reach, the efforts to prepare for defense and provide supplies have exhausted the people's strength and emptied the granaries. In the summer and autumn, we suffered from waterlogging, drought, wind, hail, and insect damage, resulting in disasters in over sixty counties. Although the remaining areas did not experience disasters, the harvests were meager. Suffering from these two disasters within a year, we are fortunate to have received frequent relief funds from the Central Government, and various parties have also made donations. The benefits provided have been praised by all. However, due to limited distribution, it has only barely prevented starvation. We hoped that this summer would bring recovery and celebration, but the drought demon has wreaked havoc, and rainfall has been delayed. Over a hundred counties in the province are once again experiencing widespread drought, especially in southern Shanxi. Since last autumn, there has been a lack of rain, and there was no snow in the winter. The winter wheat was barely sown, and the roots did not develop properly. Since the beginning of spring, strong winds have been frequent, and extreme cold has struck repeatedly. Ninety percent of the wheat seedlings have withered, and much of the cotton has not been sown. Even if it has been sown, the seedlings are extremely sparse and unlikely to grow. On the 18th and 24th and 25th of last month, various counties reported rainfall one after another, but due to the prolonged drought, the rain was insufficient to penetrate the soil, and the season for replanting wheat seedlings has passed, making it difficult to recover. The cotton planting season has also passed. Although we have telegraphed the counties to urge the people to rush to plant autumn crops, there are still several months until the autumn harvest. In the aftermath of this disaster, the people's grain reserves have long been depleted. Eighty to ninety percent of the population are already struggling to survive. They have pawned everything, and there is no way to borrow. Thin wheat paste and porridge are insufficient to fill their hungry stomachs. The digging of grass roots and tree bark is limited. The people of Shanxi attach great importance to their homeland and have deeply ingrained customs. However, recent reports from various counties indicate that impoverished people are receiving permits to flee the famine on a daily basis. Wives and children are scattered, and families are separated. Some are even selling their wives and children or secretly committing suicide. The situation is already this dire at the beginning of summer, and the days ahead are long, making it unbearable. This province is still recovering from the aftermath of the communist bandit attacks, and the provincial treasury is empty, making it impossible to raise funds. We are deeply saddened by the urgent need for relief. In addition to telegraphing the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Relief Committee to request the swift allocation of large amounts of funds for comprehensive relief, we respectfully present the actual situation of the disaster in this province. We sincerely hope that you will vigorously promote and generously provide universal relief. The benevolent soup and righteous grain that you bestow will be remembered by the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in Shanxi for the rest of their lives. I respectfully submit this telegram, awaiting your clear instructions. Zhao Daiwen, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, respectfully bows."</p>
<h3>Chang Zhicheng Telegraphs the Tragic Situation of the Disaster in Western Henan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association received a telegram from Chang Zhicheng of the Henan Relief Committee, which said (briefly): "Zhicheng went to western Henan along the Pinghan Railway on the *X*th day of May to survey the disaster situation. He visited twelve counties, including Mixian, Dengfeng, Yanshi, Luoyang, Yiyang, Luoning, Lushi, Wenxiang, Lingbao, Mianchi, and Xinan. Due to the severe drought last year, the wheat was not harvested in the autumn. There was no snow in the winter. The sparsely planted wheat seedlings were also damaged by insects and hail. This year, the wheat is less than a foot tall, with empty ears. Except for a very small number of paddy fields that have yielded a small harvest, the rest is not even enough for seed. Moreover, the wheat is short and thin, unsuitable for seed. Along the way, the tree leaves have been eaten almost entirely. People are emaciated and kneeling and weeping, refusing to leave. Tragedies such as selling wives and children and lying on the tracks to await death are frequently seen. Although it has rained recently, the autumn harvest is still far away. If relief is not continued, all will inevitably starve to death."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Railways Orders Expedited Preparations for Through Train Service Between Shanghai and Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Delays in Foreign Materials, Rescheduled Opening for New Year's Day - Both Railway Bureaus Ordered to Complete Preparations Before November</p>
<p>The through train service between Shanghai and Guangzhou, a major key to domestic transportation, was originally scheduled to be implemented on the Double Tenth Festival this year after a meeting of the heads of the Aohan, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus in Shanghai this spring. According to information obtained, the service could not be realized on the Double Tenth Festival due to the materials not arriving as scheduled and will be postponed to January 1st of next year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways Orders Expedited Preparations</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus recently received instructions from the Ministry of Railways, stating in brief: "According to the report from the Joint Transportation Department, the through train service between Shanghai and Guangzhou was originally scheduled to commence on October 10th of this year. However, due to the replacement of rails on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the foreign sleepers required were delayed in delivery by ship to Shanghai by about two months. The 33 passenger cars ordered by the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways are expected to be completed by the end of this year. Furthermore, the cars attached to this through train service by the Wagons-Lits Company will also be available for use by the end of this year or January of next year. Considering the circumstances of all parties, the commencement date of the through train service between Shanghai and Guangzhou must be appropriately postponed. It is proposed to commence the service from January 1st of the 27th year. Please approve or provide instructions on the appropriateness, etc." After investigation, the matters stated are factual and should be approved. In addition to distribution, the railway is hereby ordered to expedite preparations and complete them by the end of this year, and report the progress of preparations at any time, etc. It is now known that the two railway bureaus have ordered the engineering, traffic, mechanical, and materials departments to complete preparations before the end of November of this year.</p>
<p>Through Train Service Between Shanghai and Guangzhou to Connect Five Provinces</p>
<p>Since the active preparations by the various railways for the through train service between Shanghai and Guangzhou, the service is expected to commence on New Year's Day next year without any problems. The Qianjiang Bridge in Hangzhou is also expected to be completed in November, and the joint transportation station is also under construction. In the future, after the through train service between Shanghai and Guangzhou is opened, there will be one train per day in each direction, aiming to reach the destination in the shortest possible time. It is expected that the entire journey can be completed within 48 hours. The entire line will connect five provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong. The agriculture, industry, and commerce of these provinces are all highly developed. In the future, after the through train service is opened, it will not only be sufficient to regulate the finances of each province and develop the national economy, but it will also greatly facilitate trade between the provinces, such as the transportation of Hunan rice to Guangdong, etc. Therefore, all parties have high hopes and are very optimistic about this.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Literature Exhibition Convened Collectors' Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reporting on Collection Status, Appointing Appraisal Committee</p>
<p>The collection of exhibits for the Shanghai Literature Exhibition is largely complete. Hundreds of items have been received from various locations daily in recent days. The handwritten copy of the *Siku Quanshu* from the Wenlan Pavilion, which previously participated in the Paris Exhibition, is also planned to be solicited this time, as most Chinese people have never seen it. Other items solicited from the ten counties are quite precious, mostly items that people are usually reluctant to show easily. Recently, as the exhibition period coincides with the 10th anniversary of the municipal government, the number of visitors will inevitably be very crowded. All aspects of traffic, hygiene, and protection must be consistent with various other exhibitions. Therefore, some matters have been revised. In addition, as the deadline for receiving exhibits is approaching, matters related to the receipt of items, appraisal procedures, and the opening ceremony need to be discussed urgently. Therefore, the meeting invited the directors of collections from various counties and all executive directors to a meeting yesterday afternoon at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge. Attendees included Chairman Ye Gongchuo, Vice Chairmen Shen Xinqing and Qin Yanqi, Executive Directors Hu Zhaochun, Wu Hufan, Chen Duanzhi, Wu Jingshan, Shen Qinlu, and Lu Danlin, Directors of Collections from various counties Liu Donghai, Qin Bowen, Lei Junyan, Gao Junding, Zhang Jizhai, Zhang Bochou, Shen Xiangzhi, Gu Bingyi, Jin Jushan, Yang Weiyu, Lu Hongnian, and Zhu Kaichou, and Directors of Collections from the city Yao Yuqin, Lin Erqing, Xu Bangda, and Li Zu　, etc. Chairman Ye presided over the meeting. First, the chairman reported briefly that the deadline for receiving items from the association is approaching. In order to understand the collection status of each county and enable those responsible in each county to exchange opinions, he has invited everyone to a meeting again today. At the same time, he plans to report on the recent situation of the meeting to everyone, and some other matters are also planned to be discussed with everyone. Now, he will explain the reporting items one by one. ❶ Regarding the receipt of exhibits, as of yesterday afternoon, in addition to many items sent by institutions, organizations, and individuals, Beijing, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Suzhou have also sent the complete catalogs of exhibits. From the ten counties, Jiading, Jinshan, and Taicang have sent the first batch of more than 500 items. Songjiang, Baoshan, Fengxian, Qingpu, and Shanghai have also sent the first batch of registration forms for more than 600 types of items. As of yesterday, a total of 849 items have been received in the classics category, 236 items in the calligraphy and painting category, 70 items in the image category, 80 items in the epigraphy category, 94 items in the historical materials category, and 92 items in the local worthy relics category, totaling 1,571 items in the six categories. There are also more than 2,200 types of items for which letters have been received reporting them but registration forms have not been received. It is expected that by the deadline on the 20th, the total number of exhibits will be more than 5,000. In order to avoid duplication in the exhibits of each category, after receiving the exhibit form, the association will first check and notify the exhibitors to remove any duplicates. Therefore, the association has actually received exhibit forms from various places for more than 3,500 items. Even with the current exhibits received in each category, there are many precious items. The members of the association should be very grateful to the exhibitors and collectors. ❷ Regarding the deadline for receiving items, various places have requested an extension. The office, due to the cumbersome procedures, will still limit the deadline to the 20th, as any further delay will affect the opening date. If there are a few precious exhibits that cannot be completed in time due to the reorganization procedures, please notify the office in advance, and it can be delayed by one or two days. It is hoped that this batch of exhibits will still be sent to the association by the 20th. Please pass this on to the solicitors. ❸ The association has specially formulated measures for consignment of books and items in response to the requests of exhibitors and major bookstores from various places, which have been published in the newspapers. Today, the measures will be distributed to everyone. If anyone asks the association to sell on consignment, please contact the office before the 25th of this month. ❹ The expenses incurred by the directors of collections and helpers from various places for liaison must be high. The association is also limited by funds and cannot pay for each one individually. However, the association should pay for the funds used to transport exhibits to the association. Please ask the directors of collections from various counties, whether they personally or send someone to transport the exhibits to the association, to collect the funds from the office and not be polite. The assistance provided by various places to the association has been infinitely grateful, both in spirit and in material. It is planned to compile a special publication after the exhibition to leave a permanent memorial to repay everyone's kindness in assisting the association this time. ❺ When conducting collections in various places, most have separately organized a solicitation committee and established an office and a receiving office, and temporarily hired specialists to handle investigation, interviews, collation, registration, and other work. The enthusiasm is unprecedented. Furthermore, counties such as Fengxian plan to take this opportunity to hold a county's literature exhibition to conduct a preliminary review and arouse local interest in literature and historical sites. The speaker plans to plan a program to preserve and promote the literature and historical sites of the ten counties after the association is closed. At that time, he will discuss the details with the people of the county. Since Shanghai is a major port in the country and the city with the most international contact, things are changing very quickly and have the greatest impact on the country. The counties are all neighboring counties of Shanghai, and in the past, they were all under the jurisdiction of Song and Tai. They have a linked relationship in space and time. Literature is the mother of all things. Now that we have held this exhibition, we should further plan how to make the inherent civilization of the ten counties flourish and how to make the future culture of the ten counties advance together with other things. It is hoped that everyone present today sympathizes with this attempt. Next, Wu Hufan of Shanghai City, Qin Bowen of Shanghai County, Gao Junding of Jinshan, Lei Junyan of Songjiang, Gu Bingyi of Nanhui, Zhang Hongnian of Jiading, Zhu Kaichou of Taicang, Jin Jushan of Baoshan, Zhang Jizhai of Qingpu, and Zhang Bochou of Chuansha successively reported. In general, each county solicited more than 1,000 items, and at least 100 or 200 items. Each county has precious exhibits. Finally, Cai Jiemin, Ye Yuhu, Wang Yiting, Niu Tixian, Zhang Jusheng, Liu Yazi, Shen Xinqing, Qin Yanqi, Chen Taoyi, Teng Ruoqu, Ding Fuzhi, Wu Hufan Yao Yuqin, and Pang Laichen, and fourteen others were elected as members of the appraisal committee. The meeting adjourned at about 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Literary Association Held Its First Symposium</h3>

<p>The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Literary Association will hold its first symposium today (the 17th) at 631 Continental Emporium at 4:30 PM.

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Issues Order to Seriously Handle Drug Cases</h3>
<p>Must Carefully Investigate with Intention of Prudence</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government recently received an order from the Military Affairs Commission, which stated in brief: "The Temporary Regulations for the Prohibition of Drugs and Punishment of Crimes stipulate in Article 8 that, from the 26th year of the Republic of China, those who commit the crime of manufacturing, transporting, selling, or using drugs shall be sentenced to death. The legislation is strict, but many ignorant people still defy the law and attempt to use drugs. Those who are excusable may apply the provisions of the criminal law to reduce their sentences. However, those who abandon themselves to depravity and despise the law cannot be deterred without extreme punishment. Hereafter, the drug trial organs in each province, city, and county must handle drug cases seriously and investigate carefully, so that in the midst of strictness, there is still an intention of prudence." After receiving this order, the Municipal Government immediately instructed the Police Bureau to comply.</p>
<h3>Three World-Renowned Musicians Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Will Perform at the Nanjing Theater Soon</p>
<p>The *North China Daily News* reports that three world-renowned musicians will arrive in Shanghai soon to perform at the Nanjing Theater. One is the pianist Mr. Mirowitch, one is the violinist Mr. Piatigorsky, and one is the double bassist Mr. Schuster. Mr. Mirowitch is one of the senior American pianists who has performed in major cities in the United States and has toured the world eight times. He has repeatedly visited European capitals and is very popular. Mr. Piatigorsky is currently the solo violinist and music director of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. He is often conducted by the world's most famous conductors, such as Mr. Toscanini, and performs. He and the famous violinist Mr. Elman studied under Mr. Wall. Since 1931, he has performed with Mr. Toscanini until Mr. Toscanini's retirement. Mr. Schuster is currently the solo double bassist of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and was also a giant in the music industry in the past. In 1917, Mr. Piatigorsky and Mr. Mirowitch came to Shanghai to join the music class hastily assembled by Mr. Percy. The establishment of the music class by the Shanghai Municipal Council was due in part to the elegant rhythm of the two gentlemen, which aroused the musical interest of the people of Shanghai. The three masters plan to jointly demonstrate their high skills at the Nanjing Theater on the 24th of this month. The first half of the program will be solo performances, and the second half will be ensemble performances. It is expected that another day will be scheduled to perform with the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra. The gathering of three masters in one hall is a rare and beautiful opportunity. It is thought that connoisseurs of Western and Chinese music in Shanghai will wash their ears and listen carefully.</p>
<h3>Children's Welfare Society Sends Personnel to Investigate the Truth About the Human-Faced Spider</h3>
<p>The Human-Faced Spider is Displayed at the Family Exhibition - Played by Adults, No Harm to Children</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Children's Welfare Association has always attached great importance to cases of child abuse. Recently, it suddenly received a letter reporting that the human-faced spider on display at the Improved Family Exhibition held at the racecourse was created by destroying children's limbs, twisting and transforming them. The association, which is responsible for children's welfare, should pay attention to it, etc. After receiving the report, the association immediately sent personnel to visit Mr. Alfred, a Westerner from Chengdu Road who is responsible for supervising the holding of the Improved Family Exhibition. According to Mr. Alfred, he had reviewed the entire exhibition beforehand and there was absolutely no such thing as destroying children's limbs. Subsequently, Mr. Zhao Jian, the association's protection officer, personally went to the exhibition to investigate and learned that the so-called human-faced spider was played by adults standing behind the scenes and performing various postures. Due to the scientific effect of light changes, a phantasm of a human face suspended in the air occurred. In fact, there was no harm to children. A certain gentleman sent a report to the Children's Welfare Association out of enthusiasm, but in terms of facts, it seems that he has not fully understood the situation.</p>
<h3>What is the Intention of the Bandits Who Hijacked the Car?</h3>
<p>At about 5:00 AM yesterday, a man wearing a white-gray long gown and speaking with a Chongming accent rented a car from the Meihua Motor Company on Ningbo Road in the Public Concession, saying that he wanted to go to a certain place in Zhabei to visit the company's accountant. He often ordered the driver, Huang Zhixiang, to drive the passenger car with license number Hua Zhao 4450. When he reached the western end of Jiaotong Road in Zhabei, the passenger suddenly ordered the car to stop. Four people jumped out from the roadside, two wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers, and two wearing black long gowns. They ordered the driver to get out of the car, and two of them drove the car away. Two others monitored the driver's actions and said that the car would be back in a little while. After a while, two people returned and told the driver not to make a fuss and left. After the bandits had gone far away, Huang Zhixiang ran to report to the Caojiadu Police Station in charge, and notified the Meihua Motor Company by telephone. The company reported to the Laoza Police Station on the one hand, and went to the Caojiadu Police Station to inquire on the other hand. Unexpectedly, not long after, the car was found near the Pingmin Village on Pushan Road in Zhabei. Someone reported it to the Sun Temple Police Station, which forwarded it to the Xinzha Police Station. The car was driven back to the police station. The Xinzha Police Station then notified the Meihua Motor Company by telephone, and sent personnel to Zhabei with the Laoza Police Station to retrieve the car. However, the purpose of the bandits renting the car is unknown, and the police station has reported the situation to the Inspectorate of the Police Headquarters for record.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Tragic Overturn of the Wuxi-Shanghai Bus</h3>
<p>Three Passengers and One Driver Seriously Injured, All Other Passengers Safe</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports that the No. 47 bus of the Wuxi-Shanghai Long-Distance Bus Company unfortunately overturned on the way from Changshu to Wuxi in the early morning, causing a tragedy. The Datong News Agency reporter recorded the truth from the company as follows:</p>
<p>Departing from Changshu to Wuxi</p>
<p>The No. 4th local bus on the Changshu-Wuxi section of the Wuxi-Shanghai Long-Distance Bus departed from Changshu for Wuxi at 8:25 AM on the morning before. There were more than a dozen passengers on board at the Changshu station. After the bus reached Dongting and other stations, passengers continued to board. The total number of passengers on the bus before the accident was 25. The vehicle was driven by Jiang Jinchu (28 years old, from Danyang). According to reports, Jiang is very skilled in driving.</p>
<p>Overturned on the Way</p>
<p>When the bus passed the Guiting Station and drove between Bridge No. 3 and No. 4 at the western end, the road surface was muddy due to light rain at the time, and at the same time, it overturned in a hurry to avoid pedestrians, resulting in a tragic overturning. The wheels of the bus were facing the sky and fell to the side of the road. Fortunately, it was spotted by passers-by, who came forward to break the car windows and rescue the passengers and the driver from danger. At the same time, they rushed to report to the Guiting Station, which notified Sun Baokang, the station manager of Wuxi Station, by telephone.</p>
<p>Four People Seriously Injured</p>
<p>An examination of the passengers showed that Huang Yinmin (Captain of the Military Training Team of the Ministry of Railways), Shi Minyong (Commissioner of the Changshu Anti-Smoking Committee), and Zhu Kun (Student Military Training Office of Zhenjiang) were seriously injured. All three were injured in the chest and front ribs. At the same time, the driver, Jiang Jinchu, was also seriously injured in the chest (sent to Changshu Hospital). As for the remaining passengers, they were squeezed against each other after the overturn. Although there were minor injuries, they were not affected. At that time, the Wuxi station had already been alerted and immediately dispatched vehicles to pick up all the passengers and send them to Wuxi. After arriving in Wuxi, the three injured passengers were sent to Puren Hospital for treatment. The remaining passengers returned separately.</p>
<p>Headquarters Investigation</p>
<p>After receiving the news, the Shanghai Zhabei Headquarters immediately sent the traffic director, Zhou Zhongyi, to Wuxi at 3:00 AM on the morning before to investigate the truth of the accident and to comfort the injured passengers who were receiving treatment. He returned to Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. It was found that the accident occurred as described above. As for the overturned bus, it has been damaged and was towed to Shanghai for repairs at 11:00 AM yesterday morning. There was no loss of luggage, etc.</p>
<h3>Dying of Untreated Lung Disease, Committing Suicide by Opium</h3>
<p>The deceased was a Tianyi Actor, Coffin and Burial Arranged by Company Colleagues</p>
<p>Sun Pinglang, a 25-year-old actor from Hangzhou with the Tianyi Film Company, had been suffering severely from lung disease recently. He sought treatment but it was ineffective, causing him great suffering. On the day before yesterday, he suddenly had the thought of ending his life. Alone, he went to the Jue Lu Hotel at 250 Yu Qiaqing Road, booked room number 66, and secretly consumed a large amount of opium to commit suicide. Later, a tea server at the hotel discovered him while cleaning. The case was reported to the Lao Zha Patrol Station, and an ambulance was summoned to the scene. He was rushed to Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective. He died around 8:00 PM that evening. An investigator was dispatched to investigate and had the body transported to the Philantrophy Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, a prosecutor from the First Special Court, along with forensic doctors, visited the morgue to examine the body. According to the statement from the tea server, who worked at Jue Lu Hotel, the deceased arrived to book a room at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Around 5:00 PM, he wrote four letters and asked me to mail them. At that time, I saw his face had turned pale and knew something was wrong. So, I took the letters to the front desk to report to the staff. After they opened and read the letters, they realized he had taken poison and immediately reported it to the police, who sent him to the hospital, etc. Furthermore, according to Shen Yarlun and Fei Lun, who claimed to be colleagues of the deceased, they were notified by the police that he had taken poison. Recently, he had been on leave due to lung disease. As for whether he had any family, he never mentioned it, so they did not know. Now, the company colleagues are willing to contribute to arrange for the coffin and burial, and the two of us are here to represent the company to claim the body. Mr. Song approved this and instructed that the body be handed over to Shen and Fei to take away for the coffin and burial.</p>

<h3>Liu Songkun Embezzles Over Ten Thousand US Dollars Recounts Absurd Experience Contracts Venereal Disease, Falls for a Beauty Trap</h3>
<p>Thousand US Dollars Stolen by Fellow Townsman, Case Investigation Concluded, Sentence Scheduled for 23rd</p>
<p>Liu Songkun, a Cantonese man also known as Paul Old Kun, 25 years old, served at the Thomas Cook Travel Agency at 49 Nanjing Road after graduating from St. Francis College. On November 6th last year, Liu was instructed by his manager, a Westerner named Keaden, to mail 5,000 US dollars (equivalent to 16,750 Chinese currency) to Citibank in New York. However, Liu took the opportunity to steal the US dollars and replaced them with blank paper to mail. Liu also resigned before the incident came to light, using the embezzled money to travel to various scenic spots. He was recently arrested by detectives Sun Jishan and Han Shoushan of the General Patrol Station in Qinghefang, Hangzhou, and brought back to Shanghai, and detained by the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. During the adjournment, Liu confessed to the police about the various circumstances after embezzling the money, stating that after stealing the money, he first went to various dance halls in Shanghai, spending over a thousand dollars. Then, he took the Shanghai-Beiping train to Beiping and then to Tianjin, staying at the Huizhong Hotel. One night, he suddenly heard a woman crying in the next room, very sadly. He asked the tea server what happened. He was told that the person in the next room was a Cantonese woman named Chen Xiuzhen who came to Tianjin to look for relatives but was unsuccessful and lacked the funds to return home. Liu was moved by hometown sentiments and offered to accompany her back to Guangdong. That night, they took a train to Shanghai and stayed at the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road, waiting for a ship to Guangdong. However, when he woke up, the woman had disappeared, and the thousand US dollars in Liu's pocket had also been stolen. Liu realized he had been deceived but dared not make a sound. Thereupon, he returned to Tianjin to play, staying at the White Palace Hotel. The hotel had a dance hall, and Liu indulged in it all day long without restraint. Then he traveled to various scenic spots in Beijing and Shanghai. In Jiaxing, he contracted smallpox due to frequenting prostitutes and went to Hangzhou for medical treatment, where he was caught by the detectives. The stolen money had all been spent. Yesterday morning, this case was heard again in the Criminal Court One by Judge Qian Hongye. Liu confessed to the fact of replacing the US dollars with blank paper. After arguments between the police lawyer Ru Baoji and the defendant's lawyer Ge Zhaoji, the court concluded the arguments and scheduled the sentencing for next Wednesday (i.e., the 23rd).</p>
<h3>Gong Jingyan's Case Declared Not Guilty Yesterday</h3>

Yao accused Gong of gathering five people, including Hong Sheng and Mei Lanqing, near the United Market in Xiaodongmen on May 17th at 3:00 PM, and beating Yao, causing injuries, requesting legal action, and filing an incidental civil suit. The case has been interrogated twice by Judge Chen of the District Court and has been debated to the end. The verdict was announced yesterday (16th) at 10:00 AM. The main text was that Gong Jingyan, Hong Sheng, and Mei Lanqing were all innocent, and the incidental civil suit was dismissed.</p>
<h3>Philips Company Comprador Embezzles Over 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Wanted for Five Years, Recently Arrested. Shu Chengrong Claims It Was Owed by His Deceased Brother</p>
<p>Shu Chengrong, a Ningbo native, 38 years old, was a comprador for the Shanghai Philips Electrical Materials Company at 41 Sichuan Road. From July to August of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), he successively embezzled 109,000 yuan of the company's funds and absconded without a trace. The company reported it to the police, requesting the Special Court to issue an arrest warrant. After many years, it was not until 1:30 PM the day before yesterday that Shu Chengrong was arrested by Huishi Patrol Station detective Shang Wu and detective Zhao Ziduo at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chongqing Road, brought to the patrol station, and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court Eight of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhiyou filed a public prosecution according to Article 336, Section 2 of the Criminal Law for embezzlement and stated the case, saying that the Philips Company was opened by a Dutchman. At first, they hired the defendant's brother, Shu Chengde, as a comprador, who was very diligent and gained the trust of his superiors. After Chengde died, the defendant took over, with a monthly salary of 250 yuan. On August 29th of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the defendant suddenly left his job. At the same time, a letter from the defendant's appointed lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, stated that his brother had a lot of debts while in office. At the beginning of his tenure, the defendant originally intended to find a way to make up for it, but because the electric bulb part of the company was handled by others, his monthly income decreased, and he was affected by the Shanghai War, making it impossible to make up for it. Now he is trying to raise money outside, etc. After receiving the letter, the company was very suspicious. After investigation, it was found that the defendant had embezzled more than 100,000 yuan of the company's funds, so they reported it to the police. The defendant's method of embezzlement was that the company had buying and selling customers who could pay within three months. The defendant handled a large number of these customers. After the defendant collected the money from the customers, he did not immediately hand it over to the company but deposited it in various banks himself. Later, because the company's demand was very strict, the defendant issued bad checks, with the deadline being the end of August. The defendant suddenly left, causing all the checks to be unredeemable, totaling about 109,000 yuan. He was arrested yesterday after a warrant issued from the Special Court, the suspect was living at 18 Yuanji Lane, Tangshan Road, however he was not found. The defendant only admitted to using 40,000 yuan of the company's funds privately. His guarantor has already compensated 7,500 yuan of the funds. Now, because the amount is too different, it is requested to postpone the hearing. According to the complaint of Fugen, the accountant of the Philips Company, a German, the checks issued by the defendant, the Chinese comprador, when he left, totaled more than 100,000 yuan, all of which could not be cashed. When questioned, the defendant stated that he was a clerk in the company in the 11th year of the Republic of China and a comprador in the 16th year of the Republic of China, but all of this money was owed by the runner employed by his late brother. His lawyer, Yu Xiangqin, stated that the comprador is fully responsible for all customer funds, whether they have been collected or not. According to this situation, it does not involve criminal matters. The police should investigate this point during the postponement. Judge Chuan Lin verified the confession and instructed the defendant to be remanded in custody, pending a re-examination in seven days.</p>

<h3>Repeated Injections to Prevent Fetal Toxicity Lead to Child's Death</h3>
<p>Autopsy Results Show Death from Acute Poisoning, Guanghua Hospital Director and Doctor Accused</p>
<p>Wang Xianzong, 42, from Hefei, Anhui, owner of Renji Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 138 Yangjia Du Street, Pudong, and his wife, Liu, 34, had given birth to seven or eight children, only three of whom survived. The eldest son is 15 years old, the youngest is three years old, and the third child was born on February 26th of this year. However, the three-year-old child suffered from fetal toxicity after birth. Wang himself had suffered from syphilis ten years ago and was cured, but he feared that it would not be completely eradicated and would be passed on to his wife and children. Therefore, when his wife, Liu, was about six or seven months pregnant, around November of last year, Wang accompanied his wife, Liu, to the Shanghai Guanghua Hospital at No. 101-103-105 Baliqiao Street, French Concession, for treatment. The director and doctor of the hospital, Qian Wenhui (31 years old, from Wuxi), treated her with 606 injections. However, Wang was still afraid that the child would be infected with fetal toxicity after birth, so he asked Dr. Qian to make an appointment to bring the child for treatment after it was born. On February 26th of this year, Wang Liu gave birth to a full-term baby boy, named Xiao Niu, who was chubby and cute. In the middle of last month, the child's face suddenly developed blisters and a skin disease with yellow pus. Wang feared that this disease was fetal toxicity, so on the first day of this month, he carried Xiao Niu across the river to Shanghai and went to the Shanghai Guanghua Hospital for treatment. Qian Wenhui's assistant, Wan Xuanqing (30 years old, from Wuxi), gave him a half cc injection of blood-clearing medicine and applied medicine to the affected area, making an appointment for another injection in two weeks and vaccinating him in the second half of the year to ensure that he would never have sores or boils. After returning home, the child's face gradually cleared up. On the 15th day, Wang, following the doctor's instructions, had his wife, Wang Liu, carry the child and a neighbor across the river to Guanghua Hospital at 9:00 AM, arriving at 10:00 AM. Wan Xuanqing gave him another 0.8 cc injection of blood-clearing medicine. Unexpectedly, five minutes later, the child suddenly changed, his eyes rolled back, his mouth and nose turned blue, and his breathing was rapid, in a very dangerous state. The hospital director and doctor, Qian Wenhui, examined him and administered artificial respiration and a heart-strengthening injection, but it was ineffective. In the end, because the child was weak, he could not resist the potency of the medicine and died at 5:00 PM that afternoon. The child's mother ordered someone to notify the child's father, Wang Xianzong, who learned that Wan Xuanqing, who gave the injection, did not have a doctor's license or permit and rashly treated and injected people. The hospital director, Qian Wenhui, did not examine the child beforehand and ordered his assistant to give the injection, causing his beloved son to lose his life. Overwhelmed with grief, he reported it to the French police station, who sent detectives to investigate, arrested Qian Wenhui and Wan Xuanqing, and sent the body to the Tongren Fu Yuan Branch Hall for examination. At noon yesterday, he reported to Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court, accompanied by forensic doctors Wei and Jiang, for examination. First, Chinese and Western detectives reported the case and the investigation process, and the needle and medicine bottle were presented in the case. Then, according to the child's father, Wang Xianzong, the child had a history of two injections, and he said that the last injection was a white liquid, and this injection was a yellow liquid. When questioned, Qian Wenhui and Wan Xuanqing said that the child's mother had syphilis and came for injections to treat it, and the child was feared to have inherited syphilis, and after the last injection, the disease was feared to have entered the heart, causing the change and death after this injection. Then, the two forensic doctors dissected the body and found that the heart did not have any disease phenomena. It was indeed caused by acute poisoning. The official ordered the body to be handed over to his father for burial. The defendants, Qian Wenhui and Wan Xuanqing, were sent to the Medical Affairs Office for legal action. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the police sent the two defendants to the Second Special Court, where Judge Liao Yun presided over the First Criminal Court for interrogation. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated that the defendants caused death due to negligence in their duties. The police investigation was not completed, and a request was made to postpone the interrogation. Then, the plaintiff, Wang Xianzong, testified about the child's death from the injection. After questioning the defendants, the court ordered a postponement to the 23rd for another interrogation. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Store Prints and Distributes Silver Ear Fungus Test Report</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Store in this port is famous in Shanghai for specializing in Sichuan silver ear fungus and all Sichuan native products. The store believes that although silver ear fungus is known as a supreme tonic, in this era of scientific prosperity, there should be detailed scientific tests to accurately confirm its benefits to the public. The store previously submitted the silver ear fungus produced in its own mountains to the Shanghai Hygiene Testing Institute and Mr. Hu Shijun of the Science Society of China for two tests. The results confirmed that the chemical components contained in it are more nourishing than any other medicine, and silver ear fungus does not have the drawbacks of being biased or greasy and is suitable for consumption in all seasons. It is recognized as the most superior domestic tonic. The store has now compiled the information on the silver ear fungus tests into an accurate and faithful written report, with extremely detailed and reasonable content. If various circles wish to read it, they can write to the Sichuan Store's main store on Nanjing Road or its branch store on Polling Grounds.</p>

<h3>On "Human Nature"</h3>
<p>— V</p>
<p>We often hear people talk about the term "human nature," but what exactly is human nature? And what kind of behavior can be considered not to violate human nature? Sometimes it is indeed difficult to explain.</p>
<p>For example, let's take the example before us. He Shigen, a native of Changzhou, had four sons, all of whom died of illness. According to folk superstition, this is because "ghosts of premature death" come to collect debts. In April of this year, his daughter, He Laigui, also suffered from lung disease, which naturally seems to be the work of "ghosts of premature death." Therefore, in a moment of desperation, he carried He Laigui to the entrance of an alley and hacked her to death with a kitchen knife. Unexpectedly, the local constable, Shen Heshang, found out, reported it to the authorities for inspection, and it was confirmed to be true. He was then prosecuted for the crime of homicide under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Logically, He Shigen did not hesitate to personally kill his own daughter with a knife. This is naturally a violation of human nature. In China, although infanticide has become a common practice, it is still not permitted by law, let alone killing one's own flesh and blood. However, his motive for killing was entirely due to his children's high mortality rate, to prevent future children from dying prematurely. That is why he used cruel means on his daughter who was sick and about to die. If we talk about human nature, there is also the original human nature here. He did not kill for personal gain, but for the highest continuation of the race. From the perspective of the old Chinese society, not only was there discrimination in the treatment of men and women, but the concept of "there are three unfilial acts, and the greatest is to have no offspring" was also deeply rooted in the minds of the general public. Therefore, He Shigen, because he had no sons, in a moment of desperation, hacked his own daughter to death. In the depths of this behavior, isn't there also a hidden current of "human nature"?</p>
<p>We must believe in the existence of human nature, but we also know that its existence is not static. In certain extraordinary circumstances, there can be astonishing changes. Savages, due to their weak productive forces, had to put the elderly in their tribes to death. But this motive was due to the lack of productive forces. Some may say that this is the morality of savages, and it does not apply to civilized societies. Well, let me give you another example from a civilized society.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a great famine in Sichuan. Some women take their children and go out to beg. Because they cannot get enough to eat, they have to abandon their children on the way. In the eyes of the gentlemen, this is probably also an event that violates human nature, right?</p>
<p>But this is true human nature! In the hearts of the common people. They only know to do what their heart tells them, and they never know what hypocrisy is.</p>

<h3>Black People</h3>
<p>— Luo Caiqing</p>
<p>The impression that black people give us seems to be very bad. It's from the black people seen in many American movies. Their ears are adorned with large earrings that hang almost to their shoulders, and their noses also have nose rings piercing them. When they speak, it's a jumble, making people unhappy to see them. However, they are "devoted to their duties until their death" to their white masters. Isn't the reason why those so-called adventure films are filmed again and again, in addition to the grasp of the "business eye," also to promote the privileges of their "civilized people"?</p>
<p>So, I thought of Lincoln. In 1776, the American Declaration of Independence declared the principle of equality and freedom for mankind. In 1863, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. However, the historical records are just words on paper. Black people are still the "loyal servants" of white people, although the name is much more pleasant than "slaves."</p>
<p>However, being able to be a "loyal servant" of the master is still a "lucky one" among black people. After all, they can still stand with white people and chat. Others who want to be "loyal servants" but cannot, are subject to "civilized laws" that stipulate a "special zone" in the back of streetcars and buses for black people to ride in. Even in schools and waiting rooms at parking lots, black people are not allowed to mix with white people. In theaters, if a black person intrudes into a white person's seat, they are usually subjected to "lynching."</p>
<p>What kind of punishment is "lynching"? According to a telegram from Grenada, Missouri, USA, last month: Several black people here were arrested and imprisoned for the crime of murdering a white merchant. More than a hundred people went to the prison, seized the black people, and lynched them, that is, tied each of the black people to a post and burned them with firewood. "Mixing with white people" involves the risk of being subjected to "lynching," and "murdering white people" is, of course, an unforgivable crime.</p>
<p>When this news is publicized in newspapers, on the one hand, it does show the "heroic might" of white people, but there are also some "advocates of justice" who feel that holding "racial prejudice" is not without its problems. Yesterday's newspaper contained this "crying wolf" style telegram from Montgomery, Alabama, USA, saying that nine black people accused of insulting two white women on a freight train in 1931 were initially sentenced to death. One of them, Patterson, was spared the electric chair after a fourth retrial in January 1936, due to the advocacy of justice by local officials who held racial prejudices, and the assistance of various groups. He was resentenced to 75 years in prison, which was approved by the Supreme Court today (the 14th). When reading this news, at first I felt that there were still people in this world who "advocated justice," and that this "justice" was for black people. Then, I suddenly started calculating Patterson's age. After 75 years, what kind of monster will he become? And what about the other eight? Where has "justice" gone? Of course, we don't need to delve into the crimes they committed, because other than being a "loyal servant" waiting before the master, any other actions can be subjected to "lynching." Insulting white women is, of course, a very serious crime.</p>
<p>However, because of the insult to women, I am reminded of something. It was two or three weeks ago that two "civilized" sailors gang-raped a tour guide. At first, they quibbled, but after the police sent someone to arrest them, they paid tens of dollars to settle the matter! It was treated as if there had been no gang rape. Gang rape is probably the worst kind of "insult to women." Perhaps those black people don't have such courage, but the "civilized people" who set down some "lynching" laws for black people are the real criminals. After reading so much news about "civilized people" holding "racial prejudice" against black people, do we ever think about the fate of us yellow people? The dream of trusting "advocates of justice" has long been shattered. Only "master" is "law"!</p>
<h3>Miao Festival</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>After several sunny days, the sun showed its fierce face again. The exchange of light and heat is distressing, and the sky is cloudless for thousands of miles. The city walls suppress the foothills of the distant mountains. Occasionally, apart from Miao women using skilled words to sell wild fruits from the mountains, letting sharp tones sweep across the sky, the city would have no clamor at all.</p>
<p>Across from me, the friend's mansion employs two assimilated 　Jia Miao. It has been five or six years since they were hired. Whether in dress or language, one cannot find any traces of the Miao people. She has a kind and patient personality, and at the same time cherishes bright ideals. Her husband is about the same age as her. When there are festivals or new moons, he sometimes brings the children to the city. But although they have been assimilated on the surface, they are still very fluent in their native language.</p>
<p>These two days are a bit strange. Her clothes have changed. Like other Miao people, she has thick leggings wrapped around her legs. Her upper garment can cover below her hips, and she wears three or four silver necklaces around her neck. It seems that the weight is not light, reflecting the sunlight dazzlingly. As usual, she has the mission of delivering snacks when the friend's family makes them. This day, she was dressed neatly, went upstairs, and was full of joy!</p>
<p>"Why don't you go to see the Miao Festival, young master?" She is also used to getting straight to the point, set up afterwards, seems to feel not completely, then added a few words: "It's on Guangdong Street, these two days are exactly lively time."</p>
<p>The Miao Festival gives us great interest, why is it being celebrated? She didn't have time to answer, and hurried away. Afterwards, we also hurried over. Without walking to the central location, upon entering the street entrance, people's faces wore happy smiles, layer upon layer surrounding the core. Lusheng, flutes, drums... interplayed with each other, scattering a different tune that is rarely heard, spreading and overflowing to every corner.</p>
<p>Squeezing and squeezing, sweat droplets like many bright beads, stuck to the scorched forehead and chin. This, does not attract attention, necks are stretched very long, and toes are standing, it would be best to grow two pairs of hooks on the eyes, so you can hook the essence of the action inside.</p>
<p>The festival site is not small, this street is completely cut off from traffic. The Miao people participating in the festival, men, women, old and young, are all present, and the clothing is also bizarre and colorful, especially on young women, it is even more dazzling and competitive. Some have dozens of necklaces, and many odds and ends are carved on the circles. If you estimate the weight, it should be more than five or six pounds. It seems that something is far away inside, because of the squeezing, I can't see clearly. It is said that this place is not limited to a certain ethnic group. All those living nearby should participate in the festival.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I heard from the Miao woman employed in my friend's house that because the Miao people's leader was buried here, in order to commemorate his achievements, there are three days of worship every year, and his birthday is used as the date of the worship, so the date will never change. As for the leader's name and deeds, because of the long years, she can't remember them clearly either. Finally, she said that the day we visited was already the last day, otherwise, we would have to wait for another year of hot weather!</p>
<p>Heat, cast down flames, in the flames, we received the great ceremony.</p>
