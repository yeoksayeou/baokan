<h3>科學化與科學精神</h3>
<p>— 徐旭生</p>
<p>設想我們今天走到書舖子裏面，買了很多的書籍，把它搬回來，放在我們的書櫃子裏面，永遠不去動它，那就是放過十年八年，書總是不沾染我們一點的痕迹，即使有極敏鋭的偵探來檢查，也很難判斷這些書是什麽人藏的。如果我們拏回來以後，就努力去翻閲它，研究它，不久以後，書裏面就要加入我們所作的記號，所寫的批注，那就是加入了我們工作的痕迹。即使不然，什麽也没有加入，而經我們披閲多次以後，書頭的顔色一定變了，書皮子的形式一定不若從前的整齊了，觀察力强的偵探在那裏面發現岀來讀者是何等樣的人，並不是一件很難的事情。換句話説，就是：只要我們把這些書籍一翻，總要在那上面留下若干不可磨滅的痕迹。一個民族的文化是他們精神工作的結晶，在那上面印不上這一箇民族特殊的標識，是件不可能的事情。固然，人類思想的構造和它的發展有其大同，所以世界各民族的文化發展史有很多相類的地方，尤其是當人智進化以後，凡研究學術的人，對於好用主觀的本能，異常小心，異常抑制，使研究的結果中間，帶主觀性的成分攙入的愈少愈好，那時候全人類的學術幾乎是没有很大的分别。但是無論如何，我們的看總是用我們自己的眼睛，我們的聽總是用我們自己的耳朶。我們的感官固然有其大同，但是小異仍不能免。感官如是，思想更如是。所以我們努力所得的結果，無論如何，想使它免掉我們自有的標識是不可能的。藝術之為物，民族間的差别頗大，可以姑且撇開不説。具體的科學，如礦物，生物，社會，政治，經濟等科，地方的差别性甚大。研究的方法雖説大同，但因對象很有差别，方法也不能不跟着有其小異，因而研究的結果也不能完全相同。這些也姑且不説。進一步到抽象的科學，比方説數學之類，普徧性最大，幾乎可以説“推而放諸四海而皆準”者矣。可是你如是翻開美國人的數學書和法國人的數學書，你可以很驚異於他們的區别還没不小：有些題目，美國學者用幾箇頗單純的圖形，或幾箇公式，就可以簡短的把它們解决了，至於法國的學者，非用連篇累牘的極精密的解析，總覺得還不能自己信心，並且與人共信。幾何論約幾何摘要等書，專看它們的名字，就可以知道是中國學者的作品，别國是不大會有的。所以現在中國，只怕它没有文化，或文化不高，却不怕它没有帶着它自己標識的文化。一切主張中國本位文化或中國的科學化的學者們，全是疊牆架屋，頭上加頭，他們致慨於中國近來止有世界的文化，没有了中國的文化，那是誤認將書本從書舖子裏搬到自己書櫃子裏的人為實行工作的人。實在講起，我國近若干年從外輸入的學術，僅可以説是搬來了，真正掀開書本來努力研究，開始還没有多天，那裏談得上在那上面我們所遺留的特殊的標識。但是這是文化發展與否的問題，與將來是否保留特殊標識的問題無干。</p>
<p>我們人類的使命在於征服自然界，想要征服它，必須先要服從它的命令，換句話說，就是必須先把自然界的定律知道的淸淸楚楚：這是從歐洲文藝復興以來一切科學家所信用的金科玉律。人類文化進步的階段：最初是用簡單的工具直接或差不多直接取得衣食住的材料，以後是用複雜精良的工具，並且製造工具又成了專門的職業，間接而又間接的取得日用生活所需的品物。前者是漁獵，游牧和農業社會的特徵，後者為近世工業社會所獨有。前者需用的知識還簡單，後者需用的知識極複雜。必須知識有進步工業才能跟隨著進步。雖說古代希臘人民的知識頗為發達，而把這些知識應用到工業上面止是近一二百年的事情，可是知識就是權力，工業的發展必項實用科學的進步，實用科學的進步必須理論科學相當的成功：也是毫無庸致疑的實在情形。到近數十年來，德國人首先感覺到科學與工業的密切關係，提倡工業會社裏面的研究組織，而後工業乃有超越尋常速度的進步。所以對於自然界興趣的濃厚實為近世工業進步的主因。近來有人主張中國文化遇着歐美文化頗像鄉下人遇見城市人，中西文化的分別只在時間上，並不在性質上：這樣的說法大致是可信的。但是他們因此主張中國現在惟一的問題，就是工業化的問題，那却未免倒果為因。對於自然界的興趣不濃厚，只注意於工業的改進，終不免於無源之水，“共涸也，可立而待也”。並且近時世界各國專致力於物質的改進，忽略了人類相互間的關係，致使軍備無限度的，瘋狂的擴張，吾先民辛苦締造的文化頗有同歸於盡的危機，大約是專注意於工業，忘了全體知識，有以致之。如果對於自然界的興趣全體濃厚，而工業也跟隨著進步，那人類相互間的極可寶貴的關係，當可不至於忽視，上面所述的危機或者可以相當的免除。所以今日我們惟一的問題，不是如何工業化的問題，却是如何科學化的問題。</p>
<p>科學並不是一種成型不變的東西，只是－種方法。並且就是說它是一種方法也不甚適宜，因為方法的自身也是與日俱進的東西。科學中惟一不變的東西是它的精神，最可寶貴的也就是這一種精神。我國近來有些人，非什麼衛生的東西不肯喫，非西藥西醫不肯服，家裏也有不少的科學器械，對於一切，就表面大致可以說很有科學態度的，可是他們對於鬼狐命運等等含混的，不科學的觀念繼續着相信，這可以比作畫龍不點睛，一點精神也沒有；科學的精神一失，那其他的一切全成了呆板的，沒有生氣的，歸結鬧成了反科學的。我們現在想發展科學的精神，第一步就是遵從法國哲人特嘉爾（Descartes)的格言，把一切不明白，不淸楚的觀念全驅除到我們意識的外面，然後靠住我們健康的理性，小小心心的向前進行，那才能適用科學的方法，利用科學的結果。那時侯用不着談中國本位的文化而自然有中國的文化，不必專談工業化而工業自然可因之以發展。這種最可寶貴的科學精神却有兩個最大的仇敵：一個是舊的，可是新人也常常不免，那就是書本敎育的流毒；－個是新的，就是口號標語的迷信。這兩個仇敵打不倒，科學的精神就無法發展。但是這些話太長，他日有暇，容當專篇論之。</p>

<p>齊蘭定六月間首途　討論國際經濟問題</p>

<p>比京　據此間官方宣稱、比利時總理齊蘭、因英法兩國政府之請求、進行普遍减低關稅之調査工作、進行極為順利、齊氏已授權前任奧大利中央銀行願問福萊爾從事一切籌備工作、本人則於上星期在倫敦時會與英政府經濟顧問李滋羅斯及財政界人士以及外交財政各部之代表、舉行會商、並定下星期一訪問巴黎、然後轉赴其他各國、繼續調査工作、（十七日國民海通電）</p>

<h3>意國外交動態</h3>
<p>對英已接近對法仍不滿　與羅馬尼亞談判尚困難　南斯拉夫當局將訪羅馬</p>
<p>［羅馬］據此間政界人士宣稱、英意關係數日前甚為緊張、現已驟然轉好、變為“極端友善”、共故由於意大利從最近英國對比爾波封鎖、認為異常公正之態度、故英意關係驟然轉變、至于法意關係殊無進步、意報對白倫內閣攻擊仍不遺餘力、宣稱法國反對不干涉政策而欲使西班牙建立人民陣綫政府、至於法報所傳、佛蘭哥將軍卽將辭去軍職之說、此間認為係法國之希望、而非事實云、（十七日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］據此間消息靈通人士聲稱、意大利政府現亟望與羅馬尼亞、締結修好公約、此項公約如能訂立、則於意大利一貫外交政策、頗有臂助、所謂意大利一貫外交政策、卽保持地中海沿岸與多瑙河流城各國之普遍安謐、然而羅匈兩國之間、若因羅政府待遇少數匈牙利民族之方法、所引起緊張之局面、可以和緩、則意羅之諒解較易為功、故衆信在環境下、意羅修好公約之談判似尚感複雜困難云、（十六日國民海通電）</p>

<p>［羅馬］意國現正準備大規模之外交活動、藉以擴展其在中歐洲與多瑙河流域各國之勢力、其所採之方式、則擬先後與德奧南斯拉夫•阿爾巴尼亞•羅馬尼亞•⼟耳其等國政治家、進行談話、俾克交換意見、達到目標、例如德國航空部長戈林將軍定于本月下旬來此聘問、與首相墨索里尼相會晤、奧國國務總理舒斯尼格、亦定於本月廿二廿三兩日、在意國威尼斯城、與墨索里尼舉行談話、聞意國認為若令奧國担任德意兩國間之聯領、叫奧國內部親德份子之勢力勢必增强、此於意國不利、故不如由意國與中歐各國直接談判之為愈、關於阿爾巴尼亞問題、意南兩國上月所成立之政治經濟協定、並未加以提及、南斯拉夫國務總理兼外交部長斯多瓦的諾維區現定於本月三十日來此、卽欲與意闕簽定協定、用以解决阿爾巴尼亞問題、一俟此項協定成立之後、意國外長齊亞諾伯爵卽當親訪阿爾巴尼亞京城、復次、土耳其國務總理伊斯美外交部長魯舒第近曾訪問南斯拉夫京城、此乃欲藉南國為媒介、以謀意七兩國之接近、至於意國與羅為尼亞兩國相互接近之舉、雙方亦已在積極考慮中、（中央社十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］據眞理報消息、南斯拉夫國與土國今日在貝爾格勒討論意南希⼟四國地中海公約事、該報并稱、前曾有締結此約之運動、但卒歸失敗、因南國前外相蒂杜樓斯哥主張羅馬尼亞加入、而意國不予同意、今乃拋棄羅國而績申前議、此種締結兩方面條約之計劃、殊堪痛恨、以其危及和平也云、（中央社十七日路透電）</p>

<p>紡業發展、爾離上海而轉向他埠之趨勢、上年尤形顯著、所增紡錠、除英商均在上海、日商在上海僅一萬七千七百六十枚餘均在靑島、計三萬二千五百三十八枚、華商上海且减七千一百五十四錠、他埠則增四萬一千九百五十六錠、自二十年、在華日商紡業有迅向華北拓展之象、靑島一埠、始則增錠、繼則設廠、至二十三年而冀魯兩省日錠已超過華錠、殆經濟提携之說起、又移其重心於天律、上年一歲、卽得四廠、其裕元、寶成•天津華新三廠、購自華商裕大廠則早有日資、近則正式改隸日廠、因此冀魯兩省紡業　主客之勢縣殊、以去年而言㊀山東華廠十萬零八千二百四十四枚、日廠五十二萬零三百四十枚、㊁河北華廠十三萬四千二百十二枚、日廠十六萬八千八百六十二枚、且津沽向銷滬廠紗布甚鉅、二十年後已吿衰落、今後殆將益减、</p>

<p>前年棉產大歉後、紗愈賤而棉愈貴、各廠營業損折、初不限於藥廠、華廠財力匱乏、愈苦不支、故在上年新棉上市以前、棉業境况之劣可謂已臻其極終至無法維持、長期停業者、達二十三廠、公吿召賣者、竟達九廠、回憶彼時紡織業幾已為入視同敝屣天佑吾華、全國農產豐收、農村復興幣制日趨穩固、經濟昭蘇、紗布旣吿暢銷棉產又復大增、紗賤花貴之逆勢、幸於最短期間、頓然消除、紡業驟行起色、停工之廠、先後以出租改組復業及代營等種種方式開工、招賣九廠、除津沽二廠售於外商外、其已復業者三、餘四廠已均在洽商中、不久亦可復業、而長期停業諸廠、其現已出租者八、自行復業者二、委託代營者五、此乃十年來最良好之現象、</p>
<p>棉貨對外貿易出超</p>
<p>棉貨居海關進口之前列、已有年矣、最初、棉紗進口最多、至民九達七八、二三二、七五二海關兩之最高峯、迨國內紡廠漸興、產鈔增加因此棉紗歲减、而棉布歲增、至民十五棉布進口、達一八○、四九九、三五六海關兩之項點、至二十三四年、棉布入超已不及十萬擔、惟以棉花輸入尚多、棉貨總值仍為入超、二十五年棉產豐稔、入超棉花、降至三萬擔、卽棉布輸入價值雖高於輸出、數量則已由有關册以來之入超記錄而變為出超、二十五年花紗數量進口共計四十七萬四千公擔、出口五十二萬七千公擔比較、出超五萬三千公擔、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>“惜陰”說的演進</h3>
<p>— 陳浮</p>
<p>小時候在學校裹念書，敎科書中有一種呌做“修身”的，講的都是敎育兒童的大道理，預備他日成人，作為立身處世的金科玉律。有些道理，我至今還記得，其中的一種呌做“惜寸陰”書中畫一個道貌岸然的古人，在庭前捲起衣袖搬酒罎子，文曰“陶侃運甕，”以古人的勤奮惜時，以為後世楷模。然而當時我很懷疑：既然有暇，何不到外邊玩玩呢？我不懂得每天把酒罎子搬進搬出，有什麽好處。一直到近兩年，“誠書救國”說發明之後，這才想通了一點點，大概是呌小孩子閑空下來，不要胡鬧，還是到庭前搬搬酒罎，以惜光陰的意思。</p>
<p>“惜陰”之論，近來久矣不聞了。“修身”也早改了另一種名目。可是華胄精神，還須賡續，不過說法已經大異，證明著時代的確是在前進。其說曰，靑年立世，務須勤謹，惜時努力，以增加工作的效能。“我們做事，雖則為人家，同時也是為自己，給予人家的是成績，給予自己的是經騐，因此成績少，經騐也少。”規規矩矩的向上爬，老老實實的前走，少管閑事，多幹正經，此“社會的要求，亦迎頭趕上去的妙法”也。</p>
<p>然而尤有進焉！</p>
<p>國難嚴重，靑年已經不大安份，搬搬酒罎固然好，其奈失地千里，“親善”之聲方興未艾何！要想“奮鬥求進步”，不料無路可通，“辦公室”無由插足；幸而佔了“辦公室”一席的，孳孳矻矻，很可以“迎頭趕上去”了，又恐怕還未趕上，就做了亡國之民，萬事全休。於是指導家又來指導了，國是要救的，但救國之道，是在“各盡其能，各用其力”云。</p>
<p>論調其實並不新鮮，可說是“讀書救國”論的演進。但這種論調，共精義所在，却是說：國家的進步，要在各方面平衡發展里推進，不是一部份特殊力量，便可勝任。故凡眞正老牌的愛國家，必須不問政治，各自從本身的業務上求發展去。</p>
<p>話是對的。救國自然要讀書，一個國家的國民，全都荒惰閑游，不務正業，也誠然太不成話。但使商者勤於業，農人勤於耕，和關在屋子裏讀書未必能夠救國，其理則同。而且這樣荒唐墮落的靑年，就業而不知“各盡其能，各盡其力”的人，據現狀而論，恐怕未必很多，還不勞諄諄規導的。——中國人的彷徨苦悶並不在這裏。</p>
<p>就“惜陰論”到“本位救國說，面目雖不同，其為用則一：呌靑年安分守己，不要顧問國事，這種論調，靑年們聽聽固然不妨，如果加以信賴，却是大大的上當！</p>
<h3>桑田</h3>
<p>— 田舍</p>
<p>算一算，合村子有幾家餋蠶的？恕保叔家，族長家，癩痢壽富家，還有嗎？歪嘴阿福家半死不活的，養不養還沒定，悽慘得很，一隻手指頭還扳不滿。說起來，這勢口養蠶眞也不容易，從前說不好，還能保個本，這幾年來連本也難保，今年巴望來年，來年再巴望來年，一年一年的忙着，忙到後來還是一塲空。從窩蠶蟻直到三眼過後上山，希望嗎？吊在半空裏。</p>
<p>村子裏村子外的桑田一年一年减少，勤儉的主人把泥塊鋤鬆種油菜，栽瓜秧，搭荳棚，蓋豬窠屋。懶惰的主人任讓它荒着，長蔓草，桑樹蛀的蛀，枯的枯，伐掉當劈柴燒，頭果僅存的幾株，葉子長大了沒用處，給人摘着上茅坑。夏天摘來包醬瓜送親戚，蓋魚蝦。冬天葉子給霜打黃，女人把它全摘下扔在蒲包裏挑上街去，賣給藥店，祗幾百文一擔，亦算沒出息中的一些出息。可是這－些生話源泉之殘餘，夠做什麼？買一副鞋口滾條，秤斤鹽，打四兩油，買幾個燒餅帶給孩子，都還是不夠的。</p>
<p>眞和小時候的情景大不相同，小時</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>候我們的村子初層層密密的桑樹包圍着，遠遠的祗看到祠堂的白粉屋脊，和屋脊上的老鴉窠，村舍矮的多，別說春夏秋三季被綠蔭掩蔽，就在凋零的冬天，村子四週的枯禿桑枝，也似乎成為天然的籬笆，從籬笆裹傳出幾聲鷄鳴，狗吠，和孩子們在塲上的高唱。村子的眞面目是全然見不到的。從那許多肥沃的桑田，可以看出我們這村子的富庶，殷實，勤儉，和收穫的豐裕。一到春三月，蠶蟻窩出哺葉，便開始有人到桑田裹去摘葉，“你家今年窩幾張種？”“三張半，你家窩得多囉？”“也不多，沒人手忙呵。”“你家的（妻或夫）巴結呵，我家的就不中用。”………這些問答可以在桑田裏聽到，大家都含着一種為生活而工作的愉快之情。</p>
<p>現在不正是蠶蟻窩出的時候嗎，別說那許多愉快的問答話再也聽不到，連天然的籬笆亦被陸續拆除了，遠遠就可看見村子裏頹敗的磨屋，祗有門欄而沒有門的廠廳，和村梢那幾家的草房，外形顯得非常蕭條，冷落。正同一個癆病患者，日益贏瘦，漸漸露出靑筋，下顎，和顴骨，呈現涸竭之象。能有幾家比較好些，不愁吃，不愁燒的呢？恕寶叔，族長，癩痢壽富……這三四家比較底子好，外邊又有點面子，活絡得轉。該桑田，養蠶，也祗剩他們了。其實他們不靠這季蠶出產，養着不過顯顯他們是“大戶”而已。桑葉現成的，長工現成的，繭價好，樂得撈幾個，不好，自己剝出織綢子，拉絲棉，這樣情形，在別家再也辦不到。</p>
<p>“借本錢養蠶，自己人工不算，要是連本也丟了，那還不如坐着，橫堅都是死路！”大狗子阿龍就常這樣嘮嘮叨叨，最近又把那塊一畝四分桑田買給癩痢壽富了。“與其養蠶做了繭子被大老闆們飛價，今生今世也不預備養蠶了。大老闆們賺穩錢，刮我們的皮，我老子沒這麼瘟！”昌根也咬牙切齒的說過。堆在堂下的七八座大蠶架，都劈掉抵了柴。這道理樓子裏的太婆也弄不懂，她到處講給人聽：“這勢口湖縐直貴上去，給二姑娘買三件大衣裳料，整的化十多塊錢，綢緞鋪子裏的先生滿口推絲漲了價，為什麼養蠶的就活該倒一百二十四個霉運，一到繭子開秤，行裏便說絲賤了？”</p>
<p>可是誰也不能給她個明白的解釋，“老太婆（尊稱），你還化得起十多塊錢給千金小姐備嫁時衣呢，像我們只好伐桑樹，賣桑田過日子！”大狗子阿龍又像譏諷又像自怨自艾的回她這幾名話。在祠堂裏坐館的老秀才也常反背着手，搖頭嘆氣：“唉，書上說的老話都反應了，‘滄海桑田’，如今又將‘桑田滄海’……！”可是誰都不能了解他話裏所含的意思。</p>
<h3>傳音印機</h3>
<p>— （國維）</p>
<p>目前印刷報紙书籍的印刷機的速率巳經很快，但是究竟還嫌排字製版等工作太麻煩，於是有人發明用言語製版；只須請一個人站在一架增音器前（Microghone）將所要印刷的文字口頭讀出、由一種軟片（和有聲電影的軟片相同）拿這些文字紀錄下來，然後以片上字跡搬到另－軟片上，將兩片合一，用機器將字跡複印到鉛片上去，便成印刷底版。立刻可大量印刷，省時不知多少。所以有人預測，不久的將來，報館可以隨時山報，著作家只須將他的原稿念一遍，不到十分鐘，他的著作已在書鋪中出售，多麼便利。</p>
<h3>歸來</h3>
<p>— 白岩</p>
<p>走到柳莊前，他才睡醒了，坐正了問一問這已經到了什麼地方，於是打開轎車簾子，向外望了一望，天是陰陰地，糢糊的星光今夜也不見了。風吹得凄厲，一片片的落葉從山項上亂樹林里飛墜，車在山脚下小路中潛行，驢子不時的打一兩聲嚮鼻，</p>
<p>“離石河集還有多遠？”</p>
<p>“拐過這個山嘴子去沒多少路了。”</p>
<p>車夫說完話，仍把烟袋塞進嘴里，右手上的鞭子有一下沒一下的嚮着，經過福橋時，零落地幾間土坯房蹲伏在沉黑的夜色里，溪邊盧莑叢中，漁船上閃出火光，遠在橋南的魯家蕩，依稀能聽見曄喇曄喇竹篙撥水的聲音，大約是運私貨的船罷。</p>
<p>各隆各隆的，在亂石路上嚮着，走近坡陀的城牆了，進了城，鋪子大半已關門了，只有幾個賣零食的小攤子，還掛着半明不滅的油燈，在街角背風的地方射出熒熒地黃光，經過一帶開着烟館的小巷，靜悄悄地是一片沉黑，二三個佝僂着脊背的人影，鬼魂樣的穿行，有時飄來幾聲犬吠，沉寂中更使人感到凄然，</p>
<p>在家門前那顆老松下跳下車來，門樓里陰慘慘的掛了一盞煤油燈，給夜風吹得飄飄蕩蕩地快要熄滅了。他跟那看守故園的老僕人打了招呼，老人便歪歪倒倒地走下石階來，深深地弓着腰，拖著兩隻肥大的袖管揉了下昏花的眼睛，滿臉的皱紋浮出來一個天眞的微笑。</p>
<p>“老天爺，大先生你會回來了。”</p>
<p>少年人從燈光下笑看着這打自已呀呀學語時就帶他玩的老人，並告訴他今天所以到家太晚的緣故，是昨夜在車站遇了一塲大雨，老人有些聾了，他只喃喃不休的訴說着什麼，當走出圓月亮門時，這闊別了故居的少年人，看見東邊一帶的磚牆都倒塌了，脚下踐踏的竟是些蓬蒿，他不曾想到園內會這般荒凉，記起兒時母親培植的菜畦，淸晨的陽光，映照在金黃色的菜花上，記不起名字來的許多菜苗，發出一片鮮明的綠色……夜來月光下刺槐花放出一縷淸香，母親早晚都在園里看澆園的人汲水，這才幾年光景呢……</p>
<p>他坐在一間滿壁塵封的房內了，地下散堆着他的行裝，小小的一個手提燈擺在桌上，他疲倦的兩手扶着頭，靠桌坐着，在寂然中，他想起十年前與老父離別時，鬚眉皓白的老人，柱着拐杖顫巍巍地送他出門，母親苦笑着握他的手，老半天捨不得放開，叮囑了幾次“早些歸來”，這飄渺的影子，如今已是十年了。他輕輕地嘆了聲氣，抬起頭來：</p>
<p>“我爸爸和媽媽的墳上有人看守嗎？”</p>
<p>年老的僕人連連咳嗽着，</p>
<p>“黃山堡老爺子的墳上嗎？我老了，走不動了，整整三年沒去上墳去丁，”</p>
<p>他默默地揉了下眼睛，揮揮手令老人去睡，自巳點起一枝熊熊的紅臘燭來，揣着燭台，懶散的走進臥室去，</p>
<p>正房中的古名檯鐘，或許已經生銹了吧，也不知道現在是什麼時候，風呼呼地吹勸窗紙，夜在這小城中更濃了。</p>
<h3>賽金花（十三）</h3>
<p>— 陳禾作</p>
<p>在洋人壓境的當兒，淸丘不思人民養育之恩，以盡保護人民，和捍衛國家，為民族爭生存的責任。反乘人之危，搜刦民間財物，陷害良民。不啻上作朝廷壓制人民的工具，下助貪官汚吏剝削人民的先鋒。比烏合之衆還不如。見着洋兵，脚底反天；見着良民，笑逐顏開。這眞是破國失土的最大罪人！賽金花逃難遇着這般敗種，早已囊空如洗。長途遙遙兮！脚小零丁怎能行！日移星轉兮！肚餓腸餓怎能俟！落難的人啊！落難的人啊！你將怎樣呢？</p>

<p>###程天固 Visits Guangdong Authorities to Discuss Tax Exemption for Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Wu Te-cheng Telegraphs the Central Government Saying Original Plan Will Be Followed; Rice Merchants Request Customs to Immediately Release Rice</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Hong Kong rice merchants telegraphed the Executive Yuan and Wu Tiecheng, Yu Hanmou on the 17th, stating that based on the central government's tax exemption order number 41, they transported rice to Guangdong to relieve famine, but are now suffering losses for no reason, with goods stranded at sea for two days. Each day of delay in release causes merchants to suffer additional losses and heavy burdens. They request that customs be ordered to immediately release the rice to maintain good faith. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Cheng Tiangu visited Wu Tiecheng and Yu Hanmou on the 17th to discuss tax exemption for foreign rice. They decided to meet with rice merchants within days to solicit opinions.

<p>[Nanjing] Wu Tiecheng telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industries on the 17th regarding the tax exemption for imported foreign rice in Guangdong Province. He stated that he has already instructed to continue handling the matter according to the original plan approved by the central government. Reporters noted that the dispute between Guangdong and domestic rice merchants is very fierce. If the approved quota for tax-exempt foreign rice imports to Guangdong is reduced, Guangdong will find it difficult to accept. If the opinions of domestic rice merchants are disregarded, they will continue to oppose. A special visit was made to various experts to solicit solutions. The majority expressed that the approved four million piculs of tax-exempt foreign rice should be imported in four batches over the originally scheduled four-month period. In April, there is still a large stock of domestic rice. In August, some new rice will be harvested, so the import volume can be regulated to be smaller. May and June are precisely the time of year when the old harvest has been depleted and the new harvest is not yet in, so the import volume should be regulated to be larger. However, a standard price for domestic rice must be set separately. If the price of domestic rice falls below the standard price due to the import of tax-exempt foreign rice, the government should immediately suspend the import of this approved tax-exempt foreign rice. The majority of experts believe that this compromise will take care of both Guangdong and domestic rice merchants and hope it will be adopted and implemented. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Secretary of the American Pacific Council Gives a Speech on the Relationship Between China and Japan</h3>
<p>If Japan Does Not Restrain Itself, There Is a Risk of War; America's Transcendental Policy Is Sufficient to Alleviate Japan's Difficulties</p>
<p>Philadelphia, USA. Field, secretary of the American Pacific Council, said in a speech at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Political Science today that war between China and Japan is very likely. It is impossible for Japan to withdraw from China or automatically restrain its actions. China's anti-Japanese movement can very well lead to armed resistance. The transcendental policy of the United States is sufficient to alleviate the tense situation between China and Japan, and to alleviate Japan's internal problems, so that the civilian government can defeat the military. However, the transcendental faction in the United States believes that the United States does not need to help China attack Japan. However, the majority of people believe that if Japan's difficulties can be resolved, Japan's oppression of China can be reduced and the situation in the Far East can be improved.

<h3>Scientification and the Scientific Spirit</h3>
<p>— Xu Xusheng</p>
<p>Imagine that we went to a bookstore today, bought a lot of books, and brought them back to put in our bookshelf, never touching them. Even if ten or eight years pass, the books will not bear any trace of us. Even if a very keen detective came to inspect, it would be difficult to judge who was keeping these books. If we brought them back and worked hard to browse them and study them, before long, we would add our marks and notes to the books, which would be traces of our work. Even if not, even if nothing was added, after we had perused them many times, the color of the top of the book would definitely change, and the form of the book cover would definitely not be as neat as before. It would not be difficult for a detective with strong powers of observation to discover what kind of person the reader was. In other words, as long as we flipped through these books, we would always leave some indelible traces on them. A nation's culture is the crystallization of their spiritual work, and it is impossible for it not to imprint the special mark of that nation on it. Of course, the structure of human thought and its development have great similarities, so the cultural development history of various nations in the world has many similar aspects. Especially when human intelligence has evolved, anyone who studies academic subjects is extremely careful and restrained with their subjective instincts, so that as little subjective ingredients as possible are mixed into the results of the research. At that time, the academic subjects of all mankind are almost without great distinction. But in any case, we always look with our own eyes, and we always listen with our own ears. Our senses certainly have their great similarities, but small differences are still inevitable. If the senses are like this, then thought is even more so. Therefore, no matter how hard we work, it is impossible to make the results we obtain avoid our own marks. The difference between the arts among different nations is quite large, so we can put that aside for the time being. Concrete sciences, such as mineralogy, biology, society, politics, economics, etc., have very large local differences. Although the research methods are said to be largely the same, because the objects are very different, the methods cannot but also have their small differences, and therefore the results of the research cannot be exactly the same. These can also be put aside for the time being. Further on to abstract sciences, such as mathematics, the universality is the greatest, and it can almost be said that "when pushed, it can be applied to the four seas and all are accurate." However, if you open American math books and French math books, you may be very surprised that their differences are not small: For some problems, American scholars can solve them briefly with a few rather simple figures or a few formulas. As for French scholars, they always feel that they cannot convince themselves and others unless they use lengthy and extremely precise analyses. Books such as Geometry Outline and Geometry Summary can be known to be the works of Chinese scholars just by looking at their names, which other countries would not have much of. Therefore, China today is only afraid that it has no culture, or that its culture is not high, but it is not afraid that it has no culture with its own mark on it. All scholars who advocate Chinese-based culture or the scientification of China are all building walls on walls, adding heads on heads. They lament that China has only world culture in recent years, and no Chinese culture, which is a misidentification of people who move books from bookstores to their own bookshelves as people who carry out work. In fact, the academic subjects that our country has imported from abroad in recent years can only be said to have been moved here. We have not started earnestly studying and researching by actually opening the books for many days, so there is no question of the special marks that we have left on them. But this is a question of whether culture is developing, and it has nothing to do with whether special marks will be retained in the future.</p>
<p>The mission of mankind lies in conquering the natural world. If we want to conquer it, we must first obey its orders. In other words, we must first know the laws of nature clearly: This is the golden rule believed by all scientists since the European Renaissance. The stage of human cultural progress: At first, simple tools were used to directly or almost directly obtain materials for food, clothing, and housing. Later, complex and sophisticated tools were used, and the manufacturing of tools became a specialized profession, indirectly and again indirectly obtaining the goods needed for daily life. The former is the characteristic of hunting, nomadic, and agricultural societies, and the latter is unique to modern industrial society. The knowledge required by the former is still simple, and the knowledge required by the latter is extremely complex. Industry can only follow progress if knowledge progresses. Although the knowledge of the ancient Greeks was quite developed, it was only in the last one or two hundred years that this knowledge was applied to industry. But knowledge is power, and the development of industry must be based on the progress of applied science, and the progress of applied science must be based on the considerable success of theoretical science: This is also an undoubted reality. In the last few decades, the Germans were the first to feel the close relationship between science and industry and advocated research organizations within industrial societies, and then industry made progress beyond ordinary speed. Therefore, the strong interest in the natural world is really the main reason for the progress of modern industry. Recently, some people have argued that Chinese culture meeting European and American culture is quite like country people meeting city people. The difference between Chinese and Western cultures is only in time, not in nature: This statement is generally credible. But they therefore argue that China's only problem now is the problem of industrialization, which is putting the cart before the horse. If we do not have a strong interest in the natural world, but only pay attention to the improvement of industry, we will inevitably end up with water without a source, "both will dry up, and we can stand and wait." Moreover, in recent times, various countries in the world have focused on material improvement and neglected the relationship between human beings, resulting in the unlimited and crazy expansion of armaments. The culture painstakingly created by our ancestors has the crisis of all perishing together, which is probably due to the special attention to industry and forgetting the overall knowledge. If the overall interest in the natural world is strong, and industry also follows progress, then the extremely precious relationship between human beings can be prevented from being ignored, and the crisis mentioned above can be considerably avoided. Therefore, our only problem today is not how to industrialize, but how to scientize.</p>
<p>Science is not a fixed and unchanging thing, but only a method. And even saying that it is a method is not very appropriate, because the method itself is something that progresses with each passing day. The only unchanging thing in science is its spirit, and the most valuable thing is this spirit. Some people in our country recently are unwilling to eat anything that is not hygienic, and unwilling to take anything but Western medicine from Western doctors. There are also many scientific instruments at home. With regard to everything, it can be said that they have a very scientific attitude on the surface, but they continue to believe in vague and unscientific concepts such as ghosts, foxes, and destiny. This can be compared to drawing a dragon without dotting its eyes, without any spirit. If the spirit of science is lost, then everything else becomes rigid and lifeless, and in the end it becomes anti-scientific. If we want to develop the spirit of science now, the first step is to follow the motto of the French philosopher Descartes, to banish all unclear and unclear concepts outside our consciousness, and then carefully move forward with our healthy rationality, so that we can apply scientific methods and use the results of science. At that time, there is no need to talk about Chinese-based culture, and naturally there will be Chinese culture. There is no need to talk specifically about industrialization, and industry can naturally develop because of it. This most valuable scientific spirit has two greatest enemies: One is old, but new people often cannot avoid it, that is, the poison of book education; the other is new, that is, the superstition of slogans and signs. If these two enemies are not defeated, the spirit of science cannot be developed. But these words are too long. If there is time another day, I will discuss it in a special article.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Invites Belgian Prime Minister to Visit the United States</h3>
<p>Chirand Plans to Depart in June to Discuss International Economic Issues</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt officially stated today that he has invited Belgian Prime Minister Chirand to visit Washington, but the President did not explain the meaning of this invitation. The Belgian Prime Minister will travel to the United States in June, ostensibly to accept an honorary degree from Princeton University, but the President's invitation has aroused general speculation that the United States may convene a world economic conference early. The United Kingdom and France recently entrusted this Prime Minister to study the world economic situation, so Chirand's visit to the United States may be to discuss the United States' attitude towards the economic conference with President Roosevelt in advance. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Brussels The Prime Minister Chirand notified the cabinet today that he has accepted the invitation of US President Roosevelt and will set sail for the United States on June 10, returning to the country after staying for about three weeks. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Brussels Responsible parties have recently confirmed that Prime Minister Chirand is scheduled to travel to the United States in June. The Prime Minister chose to depart in June because he was entrusted by the governments of the United Kingdom and France to conduct investigations in European countries, and this work can only be completed at that time. The ultimate goal of this investigation is to convene an international economic conference, so Chirand must meet with US President Roosevelt at that time to allow the United States to participate in the conference. President Roosevelt has always advocated reducing tariff barriers to promote the recovery of world trade. (Central News Agency, Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Brussels It has recently been officially confirmed that Prime Minister Chirand will travel to the United States in the near future to meet with President Roosevelt and other dignitaries. According to official sources, after Prime Minister Chirand goes to the United States, he will study the implementation of the trade agreement signed between the United States and Belgium last year with the US authorities. He will also participate in the annual meeting of Princeton University in the United States on June 21, where he will be awarded an honorary degree by the university. As for the British and French governments entrusting Prime Minister Chirand to investigate the possibility of removing international trade barriers, the Prime Minister has ordered his brother, Maurice Chirand, to carry out various preparatory work. Maurice Chirand already met with Sir Lees-Ross, the British government's financial advisor, and officials from the British Foreign Office, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Finance in London last week, and will travel to Paris next Monday to continue to visit other national capitals to conduct investigations. (Central News Agency, Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Brussels According to official sources here, Belgian Prime Minister Chirand is conducting a survey on the general reduction of tariffs at the request of the British and French governments, and the progress is very smooth. Chirand has authorized former Austrian Central Bank advisor Freyerr to carry out all preparatory work. He himself met with British government economic advisor Lees-Ross and financial figures and representatives of the diplomatic and financial departments when he was in London last week and scheduled to visit Paris next Monday, and then travel to other countries to continue the investigation.

<h3>US Auto Workers Union to Sue Ford</h3>
<p>For Violating Labor Law</p>
<p>Washahua Martin, president of the United Automobile Workers Union of America, recently told a workers' congress that the union has decided to accept the invitation to participate in a conciliation conference, but the strike will continue until the conference has results. Martin also said that he is now preparing a campaign against Ford, a giant in the automotive industry. The union will soon sue Ford for violating the Wagner Act, because the bill stipulates that collective bargaining agencies must be forced to recognize. Within a day, we will try to make Ford run around in a panic. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3>Canadian Auto Workers Strike</h3>
<p>Workers Return to Work Today; Union Movement Fails</p>
<p>Canadian Washahua The auto industry strike at General Motors here has been resolved. Four thousand workers are scheduled to return to work next Monday. Martin, president of the United Automobile Workers Union of America, announced that a solution was agreed upon in Detroit yesterday, and the terms will be submitted to the workers' congress for review tonight. After the workers return to work, General Motors will begin negotiations with the workers' committees of the company's Canadian factories, and it is said that all points will be completely resolved. This type of committee will include members of the United Automobile Workers Union of America, but General Motors seems to have achieved its goal of not signing a contract with the officials of the group, but only with its own employees. One special feature of this strike is that Hepburn, chairman of the Ontario provincial government, prevented the Committee on Industrial Organization from controlling the Canadian automotive industry. Hepburn's attitude caused Labor Minister Crowell and Justice Minister Robuck to resign due to dissatisfaction. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>British Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>Metalworkers Sympathize with Shipyard Apprentices</p>
<p>[London] Twelve thousand five hundred apprentices at the naval shipyards along the River Clyde have been on strike for fifteen days due to unsuccessful demands for wage increases. Metalworkers in the area and workers from various shipyards also staged a one-day sympathy strike today. Although the Executive Committee of the labor union stated that this strike action was a disruptive act and could not be approved, the strike still occurred, and the Brown shipyard was also involved. Additionally, coal miners in several parts of the country have stopped working due to demands for wage increases and reduced working hours. Whether this labor unrest will escalate will be decided by the Mining Union in the middle of next week. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

Teller, the director of the Overseas Party Affairs Bureau, also issued a strongly worded declaration, and Foreign Minister Neurath telegraphed the Argentine ambassador to express condolences to Mrs. Lieder.

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Education Investigates the Physical Condition of Young People Nationwide</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] During the Hirota Cabinet, the government recognized that improving the physical condition of the people was the foundation for revitalizing national strength and advocated the establishment of a Ministry of Health.

<h3>Italian Diplomatic Moves</h3>
<p>Approaching England but Still Dissatisfied with France - Negotiations with Romania Still Difficult - Yugoslav Authorities to Visit Rome</p>
<p>[Rome] According to political figures here, Anglo-Italian relations, which were very tense a few days ago, have suddenly improved and become "extremely friendly." This is because Italy considers Britain's recent blockade of Bilbao to be extraordinarily fair. As a result, Anglo-Italian relations have suddenly changed. As for Franco-Italian relations, there is no progress. The Italian newspapers continue to attack the Blum cabinet, claiming that France opposes the non-intervention policy and wants to establish a Popular Front government in Spain. As for the French newspapers' reports that General Franco is about to resign from his military post, this place believes that it is France's hope, not a fact. (National Maritime Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>[Rome] According to well-informed sources here, the Italian government is now eager to conclude a friendship treaty with Romania. If this treaty can be concluded, it will be of great help to Italy's consistent diplomatic policy. The so-called Italian consistent diplomatic policy is to maintain the general tranquility of the countries along the Mediterranean coast and the Danube River basin. However, if the tense situation between Romania and Hungary caused by the Romanian government's treatment of the Hungarian minority can be eased, then Italian-Romanian understanding will be easier to achieve. Therefore, it is generally believed that negotiations on an Italian-Romanian friendship treaty are still complicated and difficult. (National Maritime Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>[Rome] It is reported that the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia, Stojadinović, will come here on the 30th of this month to return the visit and will supplement the Albanian clause in the recent treaty between Italy and Yugoslavia. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Italy is currently preparing for large-scale diplomatic activities to expand its influence in Central Europe and the Danube region. The method it adopts is to first conduct talks with politicians from Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia, Albania, Romania, and Turkey to exchange opinions and achieve goals. For example, German Aviation Minister General Göring is scheduled to come here at the end of this month to pay a visit and meet with Prime Minister Mussolini. Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg is also scheduled to hold talks with Mussolini in Venice, Italy, on the 22nd and 23rd of this month. It is said that Italy believes that if Austria is allowed to serve as a link between Germany and Italy, the power of pro-German elements in Austria will inevitably increase, which is not conducive to Italy. Therefore, it is better for Italy to negotiate directly with the countries of Central Europe. Regarding the Albanian issue, the political and economic agreement concluded between Italy and Yugoslavia last month did not mention it. The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia, Stojadinović, is now scheduled to come here on the 30th of this month to sign an agreement with Italy to resolve the Albanian issue. Once this agreement is concluded, the Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano will personally visit the Albanian capital. Furthermore, Turkish Prime Minister İsmet and Foreign Minister Rüştü recently visited the Yugoslav capital, intending to use Yugoslavia as a medium to seek closer ties between Italy and Turkey. As for the move towards mutual rapprochement between Italy and Romania, both sides are also actively considering it. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] According to the Truth newspaper, Yugoslavia and Turkey are discussing the Italian-Yugoslav-Greek-Turkish Mediterranean Pact in Belgrade today. The newspaper also said that there was a movement to conclude this pact before, but it ultimately failed because the former Yugoslav Foreign Minister Titulescu advocated Romania's accession, but Italy did not agree. Now it has abandoned Romania and continued the previous proposal. This kind of plan to conclude two-sided treaties is hateful because it endangers peace.

<h3>Serious Romanian Political Situation</h3>
<p>Royal Brother Expelled - Right Wing Unstable</p>
<p>[Vienna] After the expulsion of Romanian King Carol's brother, Prince Nicholas, the country is now on the verge of civil war or revolution. Although censorship is strict, it has been learned here today that the Peasants' Party and the Socialist Party have decided to join hands to support King Carol to oppose the Iron Guard, a fascist group. The Iron Guard secretly plotted to overthrow Carol and install Nicholas as the new king, but the secret was leaked, and Nicholas was expelled. As the Prime Minister Tătărescu is neither popular nor able to resolve the Iron Guard, the cabinet may resign. The cabinet held an emergency meeting today to discuss countermeasures. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Journal recently published a London dispatch stating that Prince Nicholas, the brother of the King of Romania, was recently demoted to commoner status for marrying a commoner woman and refusing to cancel the marriage contract. It is rumored that the Iron Guard, a fascist group in the country, is taking this opportunity to plot something untoward. Professor Gherota, the royal physician, and his assistant Dr. Verolda, have also been arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of endangering national security. It has been learned that the Iron Guard leader, Codreanu, has always sided with Nicholas and recently threatened that if the government forced the prince to leave the country, the group would not hesitate to take military action. At the same time, a leading figure on the right wing, former Prime Minister Maniu, is said to also support the Iron Guard's claim and demand that King Carol break off relations with his mistress, Mrs. Lupescu. However, the leader of the Conservative Party, Filipescu, has reached a compromise with the Peasants' Party and the Socialist Party, so that each party can establish a unified front to deal with the Iron Guard.

<h3>Hungary Arrests National Socialists</h3>
<p>More than Twenty Have Been Captured</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: The new Minister of the Interior, Sztranyavszky, today ordered the elimination of the Hungarian National Socialist Party.  Twenty-four people, including the National Socialist Party leader, Major Szálasi, have been arrested and will be charged with disturbing social order. The party headquarters was thoroughly searched, and evidence of crimes was found. The party organized by Major Szálasi imitates the National Socialist Party in everything. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: Yesterday, the government dissolved the extreme right-wing "National Will Party" and arrested the party leader, the retired officer Szálasi. However, on the same evening, the leaders of various extreme right-wing and right-wing parties held a meeting, and some leaders of the government party participated in it. When Szálasi's name was mentioned at the meeting, the whole audience stood up and applauded. When Prime Minister Darányi's name was mentioned, they exchanged glances and whispered to each other. Many people gave speeches, advocating uniting various extreme right-wing forces to seize power and establish an authoritative political system. In addition, the extreme right-wing leaders' meeting also telegraphed Admiral Horthy, the regent, expressing enthusiastic support. Therefore, some people in political circles believe that Horthy's aides are morally supporting the extreme right wing, and Prime Minister Darányi's position has become increasingly difficult. Legal circles recently said that if Prime Minister Darányi wants to ease the current political situation, he must choose between the left and right wings. The Prime Minister is scheduled to deliver a speech in Zalaegerszeg tomorrow. The general public is eagerly awaiting this speech, because under the current circumstances, the right-wing elements in the government party have stated that if the government cannot firmly support the approach to the National Socialist Party, they will rise up to oppose the government. The smallholder party and the Christian Socialist Party on the left wing of the government party have joined forces with the Revivalist Liberal Party and the Socialist Party to protest against the threat to the parliamentary system. What Prime Minister Darányi will say and do will be seen in his speech tomorrow. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Plans to Build a Navy to Compete with Japan</h3>
<p>Wants to Use American Engineers in French Shipyards - Build Two Battleships and Ten Cruisers - American and French Authorities Have Rejected It</p>
<p>[Paris] Soviet Russia is currently negotiating with France and the United States to use French shipyards and American engineers to build warships to compete with Japan. France has received a Soviet request to allow the shipyards in Saint-Nazaire, Brest, and Le Havre to build Soviet warships. Naval officials here say that France will not agree to the Soviet request, because French shipyards are still worried about building their own warships in the next five years and will not have time to build foreign warships. Moreover, the shortage of steel is also a major problem. Naval experts believe that if Soviet Russia wants to build a navy, it will take at least ten years and cost 200 million U.S. dollars to compete with Japan. According to London news, Soviet Russia may seek American engineers to help build two 35,000-ton battleships. American special envoy Davis and Colonel Wilson, the naval attache of the American embassy in England, had dinner with the Soviet ambassador to the United States, Maisky, on Wednesday. Davis then met with British Naval Minister Hoare and is said to have exchanged views on the Japanese naval issue. It is also said that Soviet Russia still needs to build ten 10,000-ton cruisers. (National Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>[Washington] It was learned today that two American arms factories had applied to the State Department for licenses to send drawings of steel cannons and gun emplacement equipment for American battleships to Soviet Russia for the construction of a Soviet battleship. This matter has been rejected by the State Department, because Soviet Russia plans to install 16-inch guns on its new ships and hire American naval experts to inspect the guns and gun emplacement equipment before they are shipped out, which is inconsistent with American policy. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The State Department revealed today that the Soviet government recently asked two American companies to supply the materials, designs, and equipment needed to install 16-inch guns on a new battleship and planned to assemble them in Soviet shipyards. The two companies that received this inquiry consulted with the State Department in early March. At that time, Japan had not yet declared that it did not approve of the suggestion that the caliber of guns be limited to 14 inches. The State Department opposed this transaction, because the maximum caliber of battleship guns was still a matter of international discussion. If the United States supplied Soviet Russia with the weapons it needed, it would create a situation unfavorable to the United States. Another reason for the State Department's opposition was that the contract for this transaction stipulated that the manufacturers should first submit the armor and cannons to the U.S. Navy for testing, which is contrary to the U.S. government's policy of not participating in the promotion of the arms export trade. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>[Washington] It was recently heard that two American arms dealers had inquired with the State Department whether they should apply for an export license if they supplied the Soviet Union with 16-inch guns and materials for building battleships. The State Department immediately replied in the affirmative, but did not specify whether it would issue the license. Regarding this matter, a semi-official source pointed out that if the U.S. government allows the export of guns and shipbuilding materials, it will naturally issue a factory certificate, but this move would be considered an assistance to Soviet Russia in expanding its naval armaments, which is inappropriate. In addition, naval powers are currently negotiating to set 14 inches as the caliber of battleship guns, and the State Department would naturally not allow the export of 16-inch guns. Moreover, if the latest American guns were supplied to other countries, it would definitely attract opposition from the general public. Therefore, the State Department would not allow the guns and shipbuilding materials to be transported to the Soviet Union. Officials said that they were unaware of the inquiries made by the arms dealers and that the Soviet Navy's shipbuilding plan was kept secret, and its contents were unknown to the United States.

<h3>British Naval Minister Hoare Warns Against Naval Competition</h3>
<p>People of All Countries Cannot Afford the Burden - England and Japan Can Restore Old Ties</p>
<p>[London] British Naval Minister Hoare said in a speech at the Naval Architecture and Engineering Team banquet last night that he was seriously concerned about the unlimited competition in world naval construction and earnestly asked the naval powers of the world to take into account the heavy burden caused by unlimited naval construction and to understand that the conclusion and maintenance of international agreements on land, sea, and air forces is not an impossible task. All countries should reconsider. If the size of battleships is not limited and new ships continue to be built, the burden on the people will reach an unbearable level. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, it is very willing to ratify the previously drafted London Naval Agreement, and the reason why it has not yet been ratified is only to enable the majority of naval powers to join in cooperation. Furthermore, the competition between the United Kingdom and the United States will never be seen again, and the United Kingdom and Germany have also concluded an agreement and can be expected to live in peace, which are all gratifying things. Hoare continued that he felt that there was no reason why the past relations between the United Kingdom and Japan could not be restored. As the recent emotional events between the United Kingdom and Japan have been peacefully resolved, he is even more hopeful. According to Hoare, the emotional events refer to the Keelung incident in Taiwan. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>American Navy Begins Exercises</h3>
<p>War Zone is Two Million Square Miles</p>
<p>American Battleship Pennsylvania Flagship Telegram: One hundred and thirty-nine American warships concentrated today to advance on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This is the largest naval exercise in American history. The war zone covers two million square miles. The battle line forms a large triangle, each side of which is more than two thousand miles long, that is, from the coast of California to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, and then to the Hawaiian Islands. Midway Island, 1,200 miles northwest of the island, is also within the battle line. Forty-five ships in the fleet are equipped with 403 aircraft. The naval authorities are keeping the fleet's organization a secret. It is rumored that there are four aircraft carriers, equipped with 274 aircraft, 15 battleships, equipped with 45 aircraft, 16 first-class cruisers, equipped with 64 aircraft, and 10 second-class cruisers, equipped with 20 aircraft. In addition, there are several squadrons of naval aircraft stationed in Pearl Harbor and the coast of California, preparing to participate in the exercise. The air and naval forces are divided into "Black" and "Blue" armies for the exercise. The organization and exercise problems of the two armies are now sealed. Even senior officers will not be able to know the details until the exercise begins. Only the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and a few staff officers are involved in the secrets. The results of the exercise will also be kept secret. Only the officers' university and senior generals will know the details. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<h3>Northern European Countries Will Sign an Agreement</h3>
<p>Exchange Military Intelligence</p>
<p>Swedish Capital: According to officials here, negotiations between Sweden, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Finland on exchanging military intelligence have reached the final stage and an agreement will be signed soon. It is said that other countries have been invited to join. (National Maritime Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<h3>Basque Military Supplies and Food are in Dire Straits</h3>
<p>The Blockade of Bilbao Has an Impact</p>
<p>Saint-Jean-de-Luz: The blockade of the port of Bilbao by the Spanish National Army is now having a major impact on the defending troops. The defending authorities, in their eagerness to obtain food, are now offering special rewards to British ship captains who break through the blockade line and transport goods into the port. If they can sail in immediately, they will be given 5,000 francs, and the amount will be reduced by 1,000 francs for each day of delay. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Bayonne: According to news from Bilbao, important figures from the Basque and Valencia governments met today to discuss the food shortage problem in northern Spain caused by the National Army's blockade. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Policy</h3>
<p>Unfavorable to the Monarchists</p>
<p>Vienna: Chancellor Schuschnigg recently gave a speech, believing that the important issue at present is the maintenance of Austria's independence, not the adoption of Austria's political system. Political circles here have commented on this. Semi-official newspapers pointed out that Schuschnigg's speech indicated that the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria was not an urgent issue. His speech was actually aimed at the upcoming negotiations in the Danube countries. The newspaper of the Nationalist Party took this opportunity to fiercely attack. Austrian royalist propagandists said that the constant mention of the imminent restoration of the Habsburg dynasty by the royalists was enough to disturb the political atmosphere. This strategy was the most unfortunate "skill of agitating the masses." Austria should not listen to irresponsible politicians as test items. (National Maritime Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Archduke Otto of the Austrian Habsburg dynasty is currently staying in Paris. Although this visit has attracted attention from all parties, it is not considered to have political significance. Well-informed sources here say that Archduke Otto does not seem to want to use the power of French political circles to increase the chances of restoration. (National Maritime Telegraph, 17th)</p>

<p>Was Found to be Unconstitutional</p>
<p>Boston: The social security law for the elderly and unemployed in the American New Deal has been ruled unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals here today. The court did not discuss whether the federal government had the authority to grant subsidies to the elderly and unemployed, but it collected taxes from wages to provide the economic source for the law, which is contrary to the constitution. The Supreme Court has also had some disputes over the same issue. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Stalled Duty-Free Foreign Rice Imports to Guangdong</h3>
<p>The Regulatory Committee Refuses to Issue Import Permits for Foreign Rice; Various Trade Associations Telegraph to Request Designation of a Certification Authority</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: After the Guangdong authorities requested and were granted by the Ministry of Finance a temporary waiver of tariffs on imported foreign rice (from April 1st to the end of August) to regulate the food supply in Guangdong Province, the Guangdong Provincial Government officially announced its implementation. Following this announcement, Guangdong rice merchants rushed to purchase Annam and Siamese rice for import. Unexpectedly, dozens of rice ships, upon arriving at the Pearl River and about to enter the city, were suddenly blocked by the Dachan Customs from entering. The merchants, pointing to the explicit order from the Guangdong Provincial Government allowing duty-free import of foreign rice for four months, questioned why the Customs was still obstructing them. They were informed that the rice being imported did not possess import permits, hence the Customs' refusal to release it. Consequently, the rice merchants sought to obtain duty-free rice import permits from the Food Regulation Committee. However, the Food Regulation Committee disclaimed any authority to issue duty-free rice import permits, stating that the committee was about to be dissolved and requested the Provincial Government to establish another body to be responsible for managing the duty-free import of foreign rice and handling registration matters. It is understood that the reason the Food Regulation Committee refuses to be responsible for managing duty-free rice imports is that this action conflicts with the committee's principles. The committee was initially established by the Finance Department, inviting banking circles to join as members, with major banks providing hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans to purchase Wuhu rice for Guangdong, aiming to regulate the food supply. Currently, the committee still holds a large quantity of unsold Wuhu rice, and the bank loans have not been recovered. Now, suddenly allowing duty-free import of foreign rice for four months will inevitably affect the committee's ability to sell the Wuhu rice it has stored. Therefore, allowing duty-free foreign rice imports constitutes a major blow to the committee. The committee's refusal to be responsible for managing and issuing duty-free foreign rice import permits is thus quite understandable. However, with the Food Regulation Committee refusing to handle the permit issuance, the merchants' hope of importing the foreign rice they have purchased seems indefinitely delayed. Consequently, those who have already purchased foreign rice in preparation for import are all anxious and worried. They have petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to find a solution. The Chamber of Commerce, noting that the four-month duty-free foreign rice import policy has been officially announced but is now being obstructed due to the Food Regulation Committee's refusal to issue permits, urgently seeks a remedy. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce immediately sent representatives to meet with the authorities to inquire about solutions, urging the establishment of an agency to issue duty-free rice permits. Simultaneously, twenty-odd trade associations, including the Restaurant and Tea House Guild, jointly telegraphed the central government, appealing, "To the esteemed President of the Nanjing Executive Yuan and the Minister of Finance, the temporary duty exemption on foreign rice is a benevolent policy of the central government to relieve the people of Guangdong. The famine-stricken people of Lingnan rejoice together, but the Food Regulation Committee has refused to provide certification, making it difficult for those starving to receive actual benefit. Furthermore, rice reserves are dwindling, and supply sources are stalled. We implore you to implement the initial intention of relieving famine, promptly designate a certification body, so that the thirty million people of Guangdong will not starve to death. We present our urgent plea for your consideration," and so on. After this telegram was sent, the merchants continued to request the Guangdong authorities to find a way to quickly issue duty-free foreign rice import permits so that the rice ships anchored in the Pearl River can unload the foreign rice to avoid spoilage and losses. Recently, the authorities announced that the approved duty-free imports of foreign rice and grains, totaling two million dan, should be transported to the inland areas of Guangdong Province separately and not entirely imported through Guangzhou. A plan has been drafted, allowing 60% of the total duty-free foreign rice and grains to be imported through the Yuehai Customs and Jiangmen Gongbei Customs, 30% through the Shantou Customs, and 10% through the Qiongzhou Customs. However, the implementation of this allocation plan still requires the finalization of detailed rules, which may not be achievable within a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Change of Head of a Certain Party's Special Agency in Zhangbei</h3>
<p>Greatly Related to a Certain Party's Plan for Chahar and Suiyuan; Wang Ying Still Plans to Rise Again, Has Sent Ma to Lobby</p>
<p>Zhangbei Dispatch: Recently, the puppet army of Chahar North, due to insufficient strength and unstable base, coupled with a certain party's concerns, their claims of advancing westward, requisitioning vehicles, transferring defenses, and constructing roads and bridges are purely for show. The outposts of both sides have not shown any signs of tension.</p>
<p>The head of a certain party's special agency, who holds all power in Zhangbei, has recently been replaced, which is greatly related to the entire situation in Chahar North. The former head of the special agency, Kuwahara, had already served in this position twice and has now been transferred. His successor, Hoshizuki, arrived in Zhangbei on the 12th of this month, and both parties completed the handover on the 14th. Hoshizuki has officially assumed his duties from that day.</p>
<p>Wang Ying, who caused the most harm on the Suiyuan battlefield, has had conflicting rumors regarding his whereabouts since the end of the war. It is now known that Wang suddenly intends to rise again. On the 13th, he secretly sent his puppet secretary-general, Ma, to Zhangbei, who is lobbying Hoshizuki, intending to act as Feng Fu again, recruiting a puppet army to be driven by a certain party.</p>
<p>A certain party's military preparations are also very active. On the evening of the 10th of this month, a certain party transported a large batch of electric fences from Dolon to Zhangbei, which were loaded onto eight heavy trucks. On the 14th, all were unloaded and stored in the Zhangbei special agency for future use. In addition, regarding the puppet organization, in order to prevent soldiers from deserting with weapons, starting from the 13th of this month, each company in each division is only allowed to keep five rifles for sentry duty, and the rest are to be collected and stored in their respective divisional headquarters.

<h3>Songjiang: Electricity Users Decide to Disconnect</h3>
<p>The Joint Association of Electricity Users held its third general meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM yesterday. Over 400 users attended. Chaired by Sun Shiheng, the company's wire-cutting was discussed at length. If the company still lacks sincerity in improving and reducing fees, it was unanimously decided that all members will automatically disconnect electricity starting from the 22nd of this month, and telegraphed the Construction Committee, suggesting that the company should be shut down and nationalized to ensure safety and prevent monopolies.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Planning to Build the Sujiao Highway</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Sukun Road in this county, travelers have found it convenient. However, those in rural areas who wish to take the Shanghai-Nanjing train find it particularly inconvenient. Recently, the Construction Department plans to build the Sujiao Road, starting from Jiaozhi Town in this county and extending westward to Suzhou, with a length of 25 kilometers. It passes through many towns and villages to facilitate transportation. Surveying has been completed, and construction will begin soon.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: An Appeal from the Suzhou Silk Weaving Industry</h3>
<p>Silk weaving factories in Suzhou, such as Zhenya, believe that China's import tariffs weigh heavily on raw materials compared to finished products. For example, each case of rayon, weighing approximately 200 pounds and valued at 150 yuan, is subject to a specific duty of 290 yuan in legal tender. If the same raw material is woven into goods, it is subject to an ad valorem duty of 80% of the value, requiring only 120 yuan. Neighboring countries, taking advantage of the gap, have been dumping large quantities of finished products at full force, causing chaos in the silk market in the past month. Retail stores are vying to purchase them, so inferior goods spread quickly, and domestic silk lags behind. If this continues, it will not only affect the survival of the silk weaving industry but also the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers. Therefore, they have jointly sent a letter to the Workers' Union branch, which telegraphed the Shanghai General Labor Union yesterday, requesting that they immediately unite with colleagues in Suzhou and Shanghai to petition in Beijing, demanding that import tariffs on finished silk products be revised and that raw material rayon be taxed ad valorem, leveling the playing field and preventing loopholes. This would give domestic silk a chance to survive and not be strangled by unfair tariffs.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Twenty-Four Silk Factories Operating</h3>
<p>During the most prosperous era of the silk industry in our county, there were a total of forty-nine factories. After the eighteenth year, due to the severe drop in the silk market, few were operating due to business failures. Since the twenty-fourth year, the silk industry has shown signs of recovery, and the market has gradually turned around. However, due to a shortage of raw materials, it is still difficult to maintain operations year-round. Last year, the silk industry giant Xue Shouyi organized the Xingye Silk Manufacturing Company, eliminating most of the speculative Guang businessmen and establishing several new small silk factories. With the increase in both input and output, the silk industry is once again showing a booming trend. According to surveys, a total of thirty-seven factories were operating last year. This year, a few factories have temporarily closed due to a lack of raw materials and will continue to operate after the new cocoons are available. Currently, Yongtai, Huaxin, Jinji, and other factories are expected to open, with a total of 24 silk factories and 9,042 silk looms.</p>
<p>Fatal Accident During Stage Construction</p>
<p>The Nanshui Xian Temple outside Nandou in our county, which enshrines Wang Qiqin, the Ming Dynasty magistrate of Wuxi, was celebrating Wang's birthday on the 17th. The people of Nanli voluntarily donated funds to build a stage with lanterns along the Qingming Bridge and Shangtang Street, stretching about two li. At night, the lights illuminated the area as if it were daytime, and Ping opera was performed in front of the temple to celebrate his meritorious deeds. Tens of thousands of people flocked to the area, causing a great stir, and traffic was completely blocked. The authorities were unable to maintain order. Tonight (18th), a large fireworks display was planned. However, Miao Er, a worker from the Wang Yuanlong Paper Shop on Nanchang Street, was building the stage when he was knocked off the ladder by Zhu Decai, a rickshaw puller. He landed headfirst, his brains splattered, and he died despite being rushed to the hospital. It was a tragic event. The rickshaw puller, Zhu Dehu, has been detained and sent to court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Haizhou: Plainclothes Officer Assassinated</h3>
<p>Zhang Lesheng, a plainclothes officer of the anti-smoking enforcement team of the Haizhou vehicle office of the Jiangsu Provincial Office of the Tobacco Suppression Inspectorate, was assassinated at around 11:00 PM last night. After watching a play at the Sanxin Theater, due to heavy rain, and his home was located across from the Yongfeng Candle and Soap Factory on Dongda Street, Lesheng hired Xu XiaoSi's rickshaw to take him home. As soon as he got out of the car in front of the door, two people rushed up, one wielding an ax, slashing Zhang several times, and the other with a handgun, firing several shots, hitting his head. He fell to the ground and died on the spot. Rickshaw puller Xu XiaoSi fled to the front of the Agricultural Bank under a wonton cart. When the Zhang family reported to the police to investigate, the murderer had already escaped. The police station, in addition to sending police to guard the body, immediately reported to the county government to send people to examine the body.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Zhen Da Road Fully Open to Traffic</h3>
<p>The Zhenhai Jiangnan to Daqi Highway, since its planning and construction in the 24th year of the Republic by Tang Ailu, director of the land administration office of the Zhenhai County Government, has been completed after two years of construction. It is scheduled to fully open to traffic on the 20th of this month. There are four stations: Daqi, Shangzhangjiabu, Gaotang, and Twenty-Eight Houses.</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang Lingers in Fenghua</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang, Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, after attending the funeral of the late Chairman Chiang in Xikou, is currently lingering in Fenghua. At 3:00 PM on the 15th, Feng met with reporters from Ningbo at his residence in Wuling Park, expressing his impressions of Fenghua, saying that Fenghua has beautiful mountains and clear waters, rich produce, and a culture that is more advanced than other places. The leader's hometown has an excellent environment, which is worthy of emulation. He hopes that the elders and brothers of the hometown will devote themselves to the country and carefully preserve the lovely and precious national land inherited from their ancestors, passing it on for generations. He greatly approved of the fact that no monks or Taoists participated in Mr. Jiang Jieqing's funeral. He also said that if he has time when passing through Ningbo on his return to Nanjing, he would very much like to meet with the compatriots of Ningbo. It is reported that Feng will stay in Xikou for several more days and will take time to visit Tianmu Mountain in the Taizhou area.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang: Qingzhen Small Passenger Ships Suspend Service</h3>
<p>The Qingzhen inland long-distance passenger ships recently received an electric order from Shao Bapao Ship Lock, stating that from the 10th of this month to the end of the month, the lock will undergo rigorous repairs, and all passing ships will be suspended. Upon receiving the news, the local shipping industry association telegraphed the joint operating office of the Zhenjiang small passenger ship companies, requesting a solution. However, the Qingzhen long-distance buses continue to operate as usual to maintain north-south transportation. Therefore, although the small passenger ships of various companies have suspended service, the general public is not inconvenienced.</p>
<h3>Gleanings from the Yunnan Journey (2)</h3>
<p>— Beijuan</p>
<p>Day 4 (April 8): Visited the Fuliang Pottery Industry Administration, the Jiangxi Porcelain Company, the Ceramics Vocational School, and the kiln firing plant. Mr. Tu, the guide, provided enthusiastic explanations, and Mr. Zhang Hao gave detailed lectures. Mr. Zhang graduated from a Japanese higher technical school and established a porcelain factory in Liaoning, achieving results surpassing Japan, which the Japanese were quite wary of. He is now in charge of the Pottery Experiment Station and is working very well with Mr. Du Chongyuan. The equipment and facilities of the Experiment Station are also simple and useful. In the future, the Fuliang porcelain industry can gradually transition from a handicraft industry to a semi-light industry. Du Chongyuan, the Director of the Fuliang Pottery Industry Administration, is the one who received national sympathy during the "New Life Incident." Du, originally from Fengtian, had an improved porcelain company in Jiujiang and gained the trust of Chairman Chiang and Chairman Xiong, who ordered him to manage Jingdezhen porcelain. The equipment of his Pottery Experiment Station, although innovative, is much more advanced than the old-fashioned manual porcelain in Jingdezhen. Du is good at rhetoric and speaking, with a grasp of the psychology of the masses. His speech at the Commissioner's Office won good sympathy from the inspection tour group. Jingdezhen porcelain exports reached 20 million yuan in the 13th year of the Republic, decreasing to only 2 million yuan in the 24th year. In the 25th year, due to the retreat of bandits in the Gan territory, it recovered to over 8 million yuan. Judging from the situation this spring, it should increase rather than decrease. In the 20th year, the Communist Fang Zhimin's troops arrived in the town twice, demanding 200,000 yuan the first time and taking gold and silver from pawnshops the second time. The third time, local civilians also raised red flags and distributed all the clothes and items in the pawnshops. Dozens of people were killed in the town at that time, and the direct losses suffered by the residents were not significant. However, villages outside the town were completely burned down. Therefore, within a hundred kilometers of the Anhui-Jiangxi border, there are only a few farmhouses, and the wasteland is continuous without anyone cultivating it. Upon entering the territory, we know that the province's population must have decreased significantly (Jiangxi's population was 20 million in the 13th year of the Republic, but only 14 million in the 25th year). In order to promote domestic porcelain, members of our group went to the exhibition hall to purchase, totaling more than a thousand yuan, which was directly sent to their homes by the institute. Averaged among 180 people, it was only a little over ten yuan per person. The Jingdezhen Chamber of Commerce has great power, and local affairs are almost entirely decided by the Chamber of Commerce. Commissioner Feng Jingfu, a short, stout man with a local accent, is quite capable. The Chamber of Commerce has a good relationship with him, so the person and the place are well-suited. The Jingdezhen woodland is only in its rudimentary form. Group Leader Chu and Mr. Long Qian each practiced Tai Chi in Taibai Garden to invigorate their muscles and bones. Day 5 (9th): At dawn, we departed from Jingdezhen and traveled over ten li to Lvmengdu, where the river is 200 feet wide. The cars were transported to the other side on ferries. After another fifty li, we passed through Leping County, where there is the Hanjiadu ferry, where the river is 400 feet wide. The Jing-Gan Railway will build a large bridge here, costing approximately one million yuan. Currently, cars are transported by ferry pulled by small wheels, taking about ten minutes per car to cross. To the north is the Pole Coal Mine, which currently produces over a hundred tons per day. This mine was taken over and reorganized by Mr. Shi Weixin, a member of our group, several years ago, so it still has its current scale. After another forty li, we reached Huangjinbu in Yujiang County, which is also a ferry crossing. We still used wheel-pulled boats to cross. After three ferries, we reached Bogan. Today, transporting to two ferry crossings did not waste any time. Indeed, the division into three groups by Secretary-General Xue Shen followed the original schedule, and no one had to wait at the riverbank. Not a moment was wasted. Only the vegetable oil car was slightly behind, but it also caught up. At 1:00 PM, we left Bogan and traveled on a smooth road, parallel to the Zhe-Gan Railway, to Liantang Town, where the Jiangxi Agricultural College is located. The college has gathered quite a few talented people. Unfortunately, the soil near the college is sandy, and plant growth is not very vigorous, so it does not appear lush. However, the indoor research is quite complete, as it is still in the stage of academic experimentation. At 4:00 PM, we arrived in Nanchang. The Nanchang Station has a car repair factory, which is quite complete and can produce over a hundred kinds of parts and repair over fifty large trucks at the same time. After arriving at the Lizhi Society, we brushed off the dust of the journey. The Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government hosted a dinner, and Chairman Xiong and others gave speeches. The Central News Agency's branch president, Cheng Xiqian, had already broadcast that night.</p>
<p>Day 6 (10th): In the morning, we visited the Highway Bureau's factory and the local product exhibition hall. Everyone purchased some summer cloth to promote it. Then, we went to the education achievements exhibition. Everything showed progress. I did not focus on the big picture, but I saw that used light bulbs were used to display agricultural products in rows, which is the ultimate use of waste. I would like to recommend it to economic speakers in various provinces. Then, we paid our respects at the Martyrs' Cemetery, with the whole country offering wreaths to the unknown heroes. There is a Ji Zhong Pagoda, made of stone with seven layers, which is the highest point near Nanchang. Climbing up and looking out, I thought of the young Wang Bo overlooking Chang'an and pointing to Wu and Hui at the Pavilion of Prince Teng, which was no different. In front of the tomb, there is a large grave, the remains of General Hu Shangzu Yu, a famous hero before the unknown heroes. The place is not far from "Qingyunpu." Qingyunpu was originally a Taoist temple with a true piece of work by Bada Shanren, which can be copied. There are also old osmanthus trees, said to be from the Ming Dynasty. The old Taoist likes to pretend to be knowledgeable, saying that Bada Shanren was the host of the temple that year. A monk running to a Taoist temple to be the head, I'm afraid that's not the case. This matter still needs to be verified by experts in historical anecdotes.</p>

<h3>The South China Rice Industry Company Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Twenty-three People Including Song Ziwen Elected as Directors</p>
<p>The South China Rice Industry Company, initiated by Song Ziwen, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, and others, and organized jointly by the financial circles of Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hong Kong, has been preparing for over a month. Its capital of ten million yuan has been fully subscribed. Yesterday (the 17th) at 4:00 PM, a founding meeting was held on the fifth floor of the Bankers' Club. Over a hundred shareholders attended, and representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Baoyun, and accountant Pan Xulun were invited to provide guidance. Song Ziwen chaired the meeting and delivered an opening speech. The articles of association were approved, and directors and supervisors were elected. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Song's Speech</p>
<p>After the routine opening ceremony, Song Ziwen was elected as the temporary chairman. He delivered an opening speech, stating that the company's purpose was reported at the previous promoters' meeting by President Sun, Mayor Wu, and himself. It is entirely for regulating the food supply in South China and supporting the rural areas in the interior. Since the share subscription, we have received the support of people from all walks of life and the assistance of the promoters. In just over a month, the original total capital of ten million yuan has fortunately been fully subscribed. This shows that people from all sectors are eagerly anticipating the early establishment of the company, which makes us feel infinitely excited and grateful. Now that preparations are complete, the founding meeting is convened today. We gather together to lay the foundation of this company on solid ground, which makes us extremely gratified. However, during this preparation period, the rice supply in Guangdong Province was scarce. If the company's rice mills could have provided loans earlier, it might have been able to remedy the situation to a considerable extent. Therefore, the company must intensify its work and organize itself as soon as possible. We hope that the annual shareholders' meeting next year will have substantial achievements. The company's future management should be based on economic principles and scientific methods to maximize efficiency and reduce costs so that consumers and producers can both obtain fairer prices. As for the current rice trading system, although the company's future practices may be slightly different, the company's planned project only accounts for a portion of South China. We also hope that rice merchants will work together with the company to achieve the goal of regulating the food supply and making the country self-sufficient in rice. However, since the establishment is just beginning, everything needs to be planned. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will provide guidance from time to time, and shareholders will provide assistance from time to time. This is our earnest hope.</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>Then, Huo Yamin, a preparation member, reported on the preparation process, stating that the company held a promoters' meeting last month to decide on the organization and set the total capital at ten million yuan, divided into one hundred thousand shares. The promoters subscribed for half of the shares, and the remaining shares were offered to the public. The undersigned was appointed to be responsible for the preparation. Now the capital has been fully subscribed as scheduled, and the one million yuan has also been fully paid, all in cash. We have dispatched personnel to investigate and survey the rice production and sales situation in various regions, as well as the establishment of rice mills and warehouses in Guangzhou and Wuhu, and have submitted reports, which will be sent to the board of directors for review and approval. During the preparation period, various expenses, including investigation fees, totaled 9,512.52 yuan, which is only one-thousandth of the total capital and should be borne by the company. Accounts are available for inspection. The preparation members have no special interests or compensation. It is specially attached for reporting.</p>

<h3>The Nanking Road Citizens' Association Cables Foreign Minister Wang Requesting the Revocation of Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The Citizens' Joint Association of the First Special District of this city telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday morning, "To Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance in Nanking, we humbly report that smuggled Japanese goods are still rampant everywhere. The opening of the gates of the provinces in North China goes without saying. Even in Shanghai, numerous seizures of smuggled goods have been made in the past month. At the same time, armed ronin have been escorting the goods and assaulting customs officials. Fortunately, the employees of the Jianghai Customs have been enforcing the law and defying violence, repeatedly seizing goods despite injuries, causing those who smuggle goods to be somewhat wary. Smuggling not only destroys the tax laws and affects tax revenue but also greatly damages national industry and commerce. If it is not swiftly curbed, the failure of national tax laws and the bankruptcy of the national economy are self-evident. We request your ministry to instruct all customs offices across the country to strengthen anti-smuggling organizations in order to eliminate the root of smuggling. The matter concerns national law, tax revenue, industry, and commerce. We hereby telegraphically request your review and implementation in order to safeguard national laws and protect the lifeline of the economy. We cannot express our earnest prayers enough. Sincerely, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Citizens' Joint Association of the First Special District of Shanghai. Hail."</p>
<h3>Citizens' Association of the Special District Cables the Ministry of Finance Requesting the Strengthening of Anti-Smuggling Organizations</h3>
<p>Instructing the Whole Country to Eliminate the Root of Smuggling</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association and the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association of this city telegraphed Wang Chonghui, the Acting Premier and Foreign Minister, yesterday to call for the abolition of consular jurisdiction, "To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, we humbly report that foreigners in China use consular jurisdiction as a shield, and unscrupulous people often take advantage of this to do evil. The tangible and intangible damages suffered by our country's people are countless. To cite the major ones: hindering the private smuggling of military goods, leading to an increase in bandits and disturbing social tranquility; smuggling drugs, leading to endless vices and sapping the morale of the people. In commercial transactions, victims of fraud have no recourse but to endure it. Opening gambling dens and casinos, luring good people into losing their morals, ruining their reputations, and destroying their families, causing endless disasters. All of this is due to the constraints of consular jurisdiction. Our country's officials have no way to investigate and ban them. Therefore, we recall the late Premier's efforts to abolish unequal treaties and yearn for it. You, Minister, are a famous figure in the legal world, renowned both domestically and internationally. You are skilled in negotiations and must have good plans to promote its early realization. Moreover, foreigners in the past used the imperfection of our country's laws as an excuse to seize the improper right of consular jurisdiction. Now, our rule of law is fully prepared and is sufficient to satisfy the wishes of foreigners. If there is no other intention, there is no reason not to be happy to comply. If you still seek cooperation with a tiger, it will not be easy to solve. We request that you, Minister, take the spirit of great fearlessness and resolutely take the initiative to show the abolition in order to extend national rights. The people of the whole country place great hopes on you. We cannot express the urgency of waiting for orders enough." Sincerely, The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association of the First District Branch of the Citizens' Joint Association of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables Again to Argue for the Tax Exemption of Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Requesting the Executive Yuan to Promulgate a Clear Order Soon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce cabled the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry in Nanking yesterday, "To the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, we humbly report that the rice merchants of six provinces have traveled to the capital twice to petition for the tax exemption of imported foreign rice in Guangdong Province, which hinders agricultural production. We are grateful for the concern of the Executive Yuan and ministries for the national economy and the people's livelihood. You have repeatedly and solemnly deliberated and sought a middle ground, showing great impartiality, which is admired by the people. The merchants also regard this case as the key to the survival of over ten million dan of stored rice in the six provinces. The fate of the rural areas depends on this. Before receiving a clear order determining the relief measures, they are all gathered in Shanghai, anxiously awaiting orders, hoping like clouds and rainbows. We humbly request that you issue a clear order soon to comfort the people. Otherwise, the sales will be sluggish and the prices will fall, and the rice markets in the six provinces will be unimaginable. We venture to submit these words and humbly request your adoption." Sincerely, The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>International Trade Bureau and Others Host Tea Merchants</h3>
<p>Japanese-Made Tea Candy and Tea Rice on Public Exhibition for Study</p>
<p>Dong Kunfan and Dong Guangying, representatives of Fujian Province at the Chicago World's Fair two years ago, noted that Japanese tea was selling well in the United States, especially the new products of tea candy and tea rice created by Japan, which were most welcomed by the people there. They studied them and made on-the-spot inspections in Japan on their return journey, making detailed investigations into the production and sales of Japanese tea and collecting dozens of samples of Japanese tea for the Chinese people to study. The International Trade Bureau, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and the International Exposition Association of this city, in view of the promotion of domestic tea production and sales and the expansion of overseas trade as the current key tasks, held a tea party at 4:00 PM yesterday at the Sixth Floor of the Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association on Avenue Edward VII, inviting tea merchants and leaders from all walks of life in this city to publicly exhibit the Japanese tea samples brought back by Mr. Dong and others, and to brew the newly produced Japanese tea candy and tea rice on the spot to entertain the guests. A total of more than 50 people, including Lin Kanghou, Zhu Yinong, and Miao Zhongxiu, attended. Lin Kanghou chaired the meeting and reported on the significance of the tea party. Dong Kunfan then reported on the production and sales of Japanese tea, stating that Japan's national affairs are progressing because the Japanese can "work hard," "work hard," and "continue to work," and the same is true for the tea industry. Therefore, they have been able to catch up and encroach on our country's overseas markets. During my inspection in Japan, I deeply felt that the progress of the Japanese tea industry relies on a strong organization and continuous research. There are comprehensive plans for variety selection, fertilization, baking, decoration, and publicity. This kind of spirit is what our country urgently needs to emulate. Then, Mr. Dong Guangying also reported on the purpose and process of establishing the Chinese Children's Health Experimental Station after returning to China. Finally, a film of the Chicago World's Fair was shown to entertain the guests. It is understood that the International Trade Bureau and others will jointly study the newly produced Japanese tea candy and tea rice with tea merchants and set up factories to manufacture them themselves, planning to bring these new products to the New York World's Fair in 1940 for exhibition.</p>

<h3>Rumor that Section Chief of Customs Administration Embezzled Funds is a False Accusation by Feng Futing</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Thoroughly Investigated and Found That All Allegations in the Original Complaint Did Not Correspond to the Facts and Had Been Concluded Long Ago</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports: Recently, there have been reports in the Beijing and Shanghai newspapers regarding allegations of embezzlement by the Department of Finance concerning a section chief of the Customs Administration, which has attracted considerable attention from society. In order to clarify the truth, our reporter visited Zheng Lai, Director of the Customs Administration, to inquire about the whole story. He received our reporter and responded as follows: According to Director Zheng, "Feng Futing, who posted an advertisement in the Beijing Morning Post, was originally a staff member of this administration. In May of last year, he falsely accused Wu Jing, Section Chief of this administration, Situ Junhou, and others of illegally seeking personal gain, and of improperly spending public funds at the Executive Yuan and the Military Commission. The Executive Yuan thoroughly investigated the matter and found that all allegations in the original complaint did not correspond to the facts. Wu Jing and Situ Junhou should be exempted from any further consideration. On July 7 of last year, the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan sent an official letter with document number 5044 to the Ministry of Finance for investigation. This case had been concluded long ago."</p>

<h3>Abstract of the Annual Report of the Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association</h3>
<p>Foreign Mills Have Expanded to Shandong and Hebei Provinces; Foreign Trade in Cotton Goods Has Turned into a Surplus</p>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association held its 20th annual meeting on April 14, reporting on the details of the domestic textile industry. The abstract is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Mills Decrease, Foreign Mills Increase</p>
<p>The number of spindles worldwide has been decreasing year by year, while China's number has been increasing year by year. At the end of 1935, the country had 4,952,826 spindles installed. By the end of 1936, this had increased to 5,071,122 spindles, an increase of over 118,000 spindles, all of which belonged to foreign mills within the country. During this period, Japanese mills increased by a total of 219,128 spindles, and British mills also increased by 33,228 spindles, while Chinese mills decreased by a net of 134,060 spindles. The divergence between Chinese and foreign mills is unprecedented. Examining the reason for this, it is due to the change in affiliation of four Chinese mills in Tianjin and Tanggu to Japanese ownership. These four mills had a total of 168,862 spindles. Without discussing the transfer of spindle nationality, based on the number of newly installed spindles, Japanese mills had 50,260 spindles, and Chinese mills had 34,802 spindles. Comparing the two, Japanese mills also had more. In recent years, foreign and Chinese mills in the country have been developing side by side, with minimal changes in the ratio, less than 1%. However, last year the situation changed drastically. The gradual prosperity of China's spinning industry is already well-known to the people of the country, but some may not yet fully understand this change.</p>
<p>Foreign Mills Have Expanded to Shandong and Hebei</p>
<p>The trend of textile industry development moving away from Shanghai to other ports has become even more pronounced last year. The increased spindles, except for those of British mills which are all in Shanghai, and Japanese mills, of which only 17,760 were in Shanghai, with the remainder, totaling 32,538, being in Qingdao, whereas Chinese mills decreased by 7,154 spindles in Shanghai, and increased by 41,956 spindles in other ports. Since 1931, the Japanese spinning industry in China has shown a rapid expansion towards North China. Starting with an increase in spindles in Qingdao, followed by the establishment of mills, by 1934, Japanese spindles in Hebei and Shandong provinces had exceeded Chinese spindles. The theory of economic cooperation began, and the focus was shifted to Tianjin. In the past year alone, four mills were acquired. The Yu Yuan, Bao Cheng, and Tianjin Hua Xin mills were purchased from Chinese merchants, and the Yu Da mill, which already had Japanese capital, was officially changed to Japanese ownership. As a result, the balance of power between the host and the guest in the spinning industry in Hebei and Shandong provinces is significantly different. In terms of last year, (1) Shandong Chinese mills had 108,244 spindles, and Japanese mills had 520,340 spindles; (2) Hebei Chinese mills had 134,212 spindles, and Japanese mills had 168,862 spindles. Furthermore, Tianjin and Tanggu used to sell a significant amount of yarn and cloth from Shanghai mills, but this has declined since 1931 and will likely decrease further in the future.</p>
<p>Mills' Operations Gradually Recover</p>
<p>After the major cotton crop failure the year before last, yarn became cheaper and cotton became more expensive. The operating losses of mills were not limited to a few. Chinese mills, lacking financial resources, suffered even more. Therefore, before the new cotton crop was on the market last year, the situation of the cotton industry was at its worst and eventually became unsustainable. The number of mills that suspended operations for a long time reached 23, and the number of mills that publicly announced their sale reached 9. Recalling that time, the textile industry was almost treated as worthless. Heaven blessed China, and the national agricultural production had a bumper harvest, rural areas were restored, the currency system became more stable, and the economy was recovering. Yarn and cloth were selling well, and cotton production increased greatly. The adverse trend of cheap yarn and expensive cotton was fortunately eliminated in the shortest period of time. The spinning industry suddenly improved. The mills that had suspended operations resumed operations in various ways, such as leasing, reorganization, resumption of operations, and agency operations. Of the nine mills for sale, except for the two mills in Tianjin and Tanggu that were sold to foreign merchants, three have already resumed operations, and the remaining four are still under negotiation and will soon resume operations. Of the mills that have suspended operations for a long time, eight have been leased, two have resumed operations on their own, and five have been entrusted to agents for operation. This is the most favorable phenomenon in ten years.</p>
<p>Foreign Trade in Cotton Goods Shows a Surplus</p>
<p>Cotton goods have been at the forefront of customs imports for many years. Initially, cotton yarn was the most imported, reaching its peak in 1920 at 78,232,752 customs taels. As domestic spinning mills gradually emerged and the production of banknotes increased, cotton yarn imports decreased year by year, while cotton cloth imports increased year by year. By 1926, cotton cloth imports reached a peak of 180,499,356 customs taels. By 1934 and 1935, the cotton cloth import surplus was less than 100,000 dan. However, due to the large import of cotton, the total value of cotton goods was still an import surplus. In 1936, with a bumper cotton crop, imported surplus cotton decreased to 30,000 dan. Although the import value of cotton cloth was higher than the export value, the quantity had changed from an import surplus record since the relevant records began to an export surplus. In 1936, the total quantity of imported flowers and yarn was 474,000 metric tons, and the export quantity was 527,000 metric tons, a surplus of 53,000 metric tons.</p>
<h3>Workers of the Public Welfare Cotton Mill Petition the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Demanding Swift Mediation</p>
<p>After the British-owned Public Welfare Cotton Mill on Rue Robert in Western Shanghai announced the suspension of operations due to a workers' strike, all the workers petitioned for mediation the day before yesterday but were blocked by police officers from the Caojiadu Police Sub-bureau. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., they changed their approach and sent six representatives, including Dai Guoliang, to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition for swift mediation in order to maintain the workers' livelihood. Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section of the Third Department, received them and promised to immediately consult the Director of the Bureau for instructions.</p>
<h3>Jiangdu County Detained Lü Zhuqing, Court First Approved Transfer</h3>
<p>Should Supplement Transfer Procedures and Evidence</p>
<p>The bandit Lü Zhuqing, also known as Xiaoqing, is 42 years old this year. Because he formed a gang to commit robbery in Jiangdu County, Yangzhou, committing numerous crimes, he fled to Shanghai and hid in a thatched shed in the south end of Dapuqiao in the Chinese area. Every morning, he made a living as a vendor in the Xinli Small Vegetable Market on Route Père Robert in the French Concession. Recently, his accomplices were captured in Jiangdu and revealed Lü's hiding place in Shanghai. Therefore, the Jiangdu County Police Bureau, led by Detective Team Leader Liu Zonghan, came to Shanghai to investigate. They encountered Lü at the Xinxinli Small Vegetable Market on Route Père Robert at 10 a.m. the day before yesterday and ordered the Chinese patrolman on duty at Post No. 43 to arrest Lü and bring him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Special No. 2 Court. Presiding Judge Liao of the Criminal Court interrogated him in the Criminal Division No. 1. First, he asked Lü's name, age, address, and occupation. Then, Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case, briefly saying that the defendant committed crimes in Jiangdu County. The Jiangdu County Government prepared an official letter and sent personnel to Shanghai to request the assistance of the French police in arresting the defendant. However, the visiting personnel did not submit evidence of the defendant's crime. They should be ordered to supplement the evidence before the transfer. Liu Zonghan, Detective Team Leader of the Jiangdu County Police Bureau, submitted the case, requesting that the defendant be transferred to his custody for investigation. If they waited for the supplementary evidence, the accomplices would surely flee upon hearing the news. Questioning Lü, he denied committing crimes in the mainland. After verifying the statements, the court approved the transfer of the defendant to the custody of the Jiangdu County personnel, and ordered the submission of transfer procedures and evidence for review.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Trade Association Schedules Celebration of First Sino-American Flight</h3>
<p>Reports on Preparations and Route Times; Commemorative Envelopes Printed to Invite People from All Walks of Life to Participate</p>
<p>Since the American Airlines China Clipper crossed the Pacific Ocean and arrived in Manila last year, only the section between Manila and Hong Kong remained. There were already China National Aviation Corporation flights between Shanghai and Hong Kong, carrying passengers. Last year, with the efforts of various parties, the section between Manila and Hong Kong was also opened to air travel. Shanghai to San Francisco can be reached via Hong Kong, Manila, and Honolulu. This opened a new era in Sino-American aviation. The Sino-American journey used to take 14 days, but now it only takes seven days. The first official flight between China and the United States is scheduled for April 27. Mail can be sent between China and the US as of that date. The Sino-American Trade Association will hold a celebration banquet at the American Club on Fuzhou Road at noon on April 26. In addition to reports from key figures in the aviation industry on the preparations for Sino-American aviation and explanations of the route and timing, commemorative envelopes will be printed and sold on the spot. Aviation letters can be mailed at the banquet. Personnel are now actively preparing the invitation cards for people from all walks of life to participate.</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation yesterday received an official notice from Pan American Airways that the final section of the Sino-American joint air transport route will begin operations on April 28. On that day, a Clipper with two four-engines will be used to transport airmail from Manila to Hong Kong. Last year, the company's Clipper seaplane has already started flying from the United States (San Francisco) to the Philippine Islands (Manila) once a week. Now it will fly directly to Hong Kong, opening a new era in Sino-American transportation, and Sino-American trade will therefore become even more prosperous. The dreams of ancient poets and writers are now the most ordinary journey for aviation travelers. In terms of civilian aircraft departing from Shanghai, traveling around the world via Hong Kong takes less time than traveling by sea from Shanghai to North America and Southern Europe. The first joint air transport mail from China via Shanghai to the United States will be transported from Shanghai on April 17 (Tuesday) and will arrive in San Francisco on May 4 (Tuesday). (All airmail from China to the United States via Shanghai will be transported weekly.) For airmail from various parts of China to the Philippine Islands, Guam, Hawaii, Canada, and cities in the United States, in addition to ordinary foreign postage of 25 cents for every 20 grams, an additional airmail fee should be added for every 5 grams as follows: Philippine Islands 35 cents, Guam 50 cents, Hawaii 85 cents, United States and Canada (including domestic airmail in Canada and the United States) 1.20 yuan. For example, the postage for airmail from Shanghai to New York, USA, weighing 5 grams is 1.20 yuan, plus the ordinary foreign postage of 25 cents, for a total of 1.45 yuan. For registered letters, an additional 25 cents will be charged in addition to ordinary and airmail postage. Now, the Clipper seaplane is scheduled to start carrying passengers on May 6, departing from Hong Kong. Passengers from Shanghai should take the CNAC Shanghai-Guangdong route plane to Hong Kong on May 4 and transfer to the Clipper to fly to the Americas. (In the future, it is tentatively scheduled to transport passengers, goods, and mail from Shanghai to Hong Kong for transfer to the Clipper every Tuesday to fly to the Americas.) CNAC has received inquiries from Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai, who want to be among the first to try the initial joint Sino-American air transport. However, the company does not want to publish the names of the passengers yet, but it says that ticket sales will be in order of seat reservation on a first-come, first-served basis, and tickets will be sold while supplies last. For inquiries about ticket prices and other matters, please go to the CNAC ticket office at 57 Nanjing Road in this city, or the company's offices or agencies in various locations.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Orders Silk Weavers to Resume Work Immediately</h3>
<p>Also Mediating Dispute at Tianyi Silk Factory; First District Union Rescues Zhou Yunqing</p>
<p>After silk factory workers requested improved treatment and a ruling was made, the city has legally handled the industry association's case. The Social Affairs Bureau has ordered workers at the Meiya Jingwei Factory and other silk factories to resume work immediately, or face severe punishment. It is also mediating the dispute at Tianyi Factory, and the First District Silk Weavers Union is petitioning to rescue the arrested Zhou Yunqing. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Awaiting Adjudication</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau instructed the First, Third, Fourth, and Seventh District Silk Industry Unions, stating: "Regarding the case of silk workers in this city requesting wage increases and improved treatment from factory owners, this Bureau has already made an impartial decision and issued an instruction, City Order No. 8476, to be followed. Now, because the Electrical Silk Industry Association is dissatisfied with the Bureau's decision and has filed an appeal, a legal response has been made. During the appeal period, the unions in each district should await the Municipal Government's legal adjudication and refrain from causing disturbances. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued for compliance without fail."</p>
<p>No Strikes Allowed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau instructed the preparatory committees or offices of the First, Third, Fourth, and Seventh District Silk Industry Unions and the Electrical Silk Factory Industry Association, stating: "The Company Law and Factory Implementation Regulations have explicit provisions regarding holiday pay for factory workers on commemorative days. The issue of holiday pay was also included in the workers' request for improved treatment, and the request was made before March 29th. Therefore, holiday pay should be provided in accordance with the law for the March 29th Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day. As for the workers' working hours, both parties have agreed to set it at eleven hours. The so-called working hours refer to actual working time, and meal times are naturally not included. Since the various silk factory workers have repeatedly inquired about this, it is necessary to provide an explanation to ensure compliance. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued for compliance. If any employer has not complied with the order, it should be reported truthfully for review and handling, and no strikes should be used as an excuse, which would violate the law."</p>
<p>Tianyi Mediation</p>
<p>Regarding the Tianyi Xieji Silk Factory at the intersection of Jinsheng Road and Pingliang Road in Pudong, after the workers went on strike and announced a work stoppage, the Social Affairs Bureau, in order to resolve the situation as soon as possible, convened both parties at the Bureau at 9:00 AM yesterday for questioning and mediation. Representatives from the management side were Li Yinchu and Zhang Tingcheng, and representatives from the labor side were Yu Zongren and Song Baiying. The mediation was chaired by Zhang Chuqiang, a mediator from the Social Affairs Bureau. The management representatives stated that the workers had been uneasy and stopped working halfway through the shift for several days, and had returned to their hometowns, making it impossible to resume production. The labor representatives stated that the conditions were unacceptable, and requested a strict order for the factory to resume production. The mediation lasted until noon, but no agreement was reached due to the parties' inability to reconcile their views. Party and government agencies have decided to convene another round of mediation.</p>
<p>Petition for Rescue</p>
<p>Zhou Yunqing, a preparatory member of the First District Silk Industry Union, is a worker at the Jiu Hua Silk Factory in Nanshi and was elected as the Nanshi District Committee Member of the Citywide Silk Workers' Movement to Demand Improved Treatment. On the evening of the 15th, while walking near the entrance of Sanxingfang on Dapu Road (near the union), he was arrested by plainclothes officers. The district union sent representatives to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau the day before yesterday to petition for his rescue, and organized a Rescue Committee. They plan to petition again tomorrow (Monday).</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Continues to Allocate Disaster Relief Funds and Food</h3>
<p>Relief for Henan Disaster</p>
<p>The Joint Office of the Chinese Southeast Branches of the World Red Swastika Society previously received a telegram from the Joint Committee for Guidance of Party, Government, and Military Work in Henan Province, stating that the drought-stricken area in Henan Province covered more than ninety counties, with millions of disaster victims and countless displaced and dead people. They requested the allocation of relief funds for assistance. The office sent letters to various branches to raise funds for relief. The Wuxi Red Swastika Society, in conjunction with the Puren Charity Association, raised funds to purchase 6,000 bags of corn, which were transported to Shan County in the province for distribution. Zhang Zizhen and Lan Zhonghao, the presidents of the two associations, were publicly recommended to go to the disaster area for inspection and distribution. According to reports from Zhang and Lan yesterday, the disaster area in Shan County is vast, and the number of disaster victims is large. The donated grain is insufficient for distribution. The Wuxi Red Swastika Society has purchased an additional 3,000 bags of corn, which will be transported for relief immediately. However, requests for assistance from various counties in Henan Province are pouring in like snowflakes, and samples of food for disaster victims are being sent to the Shanghai and Wuxi branches for assistance. The Southeast Joint Office has specially raised 4,000 yuan in relief funds and handed them over to the Farmers Bank of China for remittance to the Henan Provincial Government, which will be transferred to the Committee for Guidance of Party, Government, and Military Work for inspection and receipt, and distributed to the most severely affected areas for relief. It is hoped that benevolent gentlemen from all walks of life will generously contribute and continuously provide assistance to save the dying disaster victims. The merit is immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee's Fundraising in the Capital</h3>
<p>The China Foreign Famine Relief Committee, located at 505 Henan Road in this city, is raising funds for disaster prevention projects. In the capital, fundraising for the 15th-anniversary commemoration is being carried out. Chairman Wang Jingwei and American Ambassador Johnson, along with prominent Chinese and foreign figures, have convened leaders from all walks of life to discuss the progress. They have received enthusiastic support. Ma Chaojun, the mayor of Nanjing, and Baker, the general secretary of the committee, each presented a silver cup to those with the best work performance as an incentive. The fundraising was originally scheduled to last for ten days, from the 6th to the 16th of this month. However, because many important figures in the capital went to Fenghua to attend the funeral, they were unable to raise funds as scheduled, so it was extended by one week to the 23rd. Currently, donations received include 300 yuan from German consultant Heshuzhu, 200 yuan from acting Premier Wang Chonghui, 200 yuan from Minister of the Interior Jiang Zuobin, 110 yuan from the American Embassy, 213 yuan jointly donated by Yang Zaichun and others from the Ministry of the Interior, 100 yuan from colleagues at the Jinling Customs, 62 yuan from the Jiangsu Postal Administration, 55 yuan from Cai Ziping, the director of the Secretariat of the Ministry of the Interior, 10 yuan from Mr. McKay of Jardine Matheson, and 5 yuan from League of Nations technical expert Gentre.

To maintain order in the venue, a ticket price of five cents is charged for those without complimentary tickets. Yesterday (the 17th), the association received inquiries from various institutions and organizations about group visit arrangements. The association has now formulated a plan. Any schools, organizations, etc., holding letters or business cards can visit regardless of the number of people to promote widespread participation.</p>

<h3>Fire Brigade Holds Drill, Injuring Mrs. Schneider, Municipal Council Responsible for Compensation</h3>
<p>After Disfigurement, Consular Court Sentences, Including 9,400 Yuan in Litigation Costs</p>
<p>According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," on August 20th of last year, the Public Concession Fire Brigade held a fire drill at the Racecourse Apartments. While extending the ladder and approaching the wall of the apartment, a connecting object unexpectedly fell from the end of the ladder and struck the face of Mrs. Schneider, a German national, causing injury below her left eye, leaving a permanent scar. Subsequently, Mrs. Schneider hired lawyer MacDonald to sue the Municipal Council in the Consular Court, seeking compensation for losses of 220,000 yuan. Later, the lawyer stated that the amount was reduced to 145,000 yuan. The case was heard multiple times. The final hearing was on April 13th of this year. On that day, the debate was declared over. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that since the injury, Mrs. Schneider had not only been disfigured, but also suffered damage to her cheekbones, preventing her upper and lower jaws from meeting properly, making her speech unclear, and preventing her from opening her mouth wide. Her eyesight was dull, and she suffered from frequent headaches and nervous weakness. Mrs. Schneider was originally the caretaker of the apartment. After the injury, she lost her job and, due to her disfigurement, was unable to find employment elsewhere. Her hope of being hired in the future was slim. Therefore, the court was asked to consider this situation and order the Municipal Council to compensate the requested amount, etc. The defendant's lawyer, Borland, stated that the fire brigade had taken all precautions at the time, and that the unfortunate incident was beyond human control, etc. The plaintiff's lawyer then asked whether it was caused by God. Later, the court recognized that the defendant's argument was flawed and should compensate the plaintiff for the loss. However, the amount of compensation was not determined on that day. The defendant's lawyer stated that the amount requested by the plaintiff was too large. If the Municipal Council was ordered to pay a large sum, it would go against the policy of the Consular Court. The largest amount of compensation ever paid by the Municipal Council in loss cases was 4,680 yuan, plus 900 yuan in litigation costs and 200 yuan in miscellaneous expenses, which was given to a certain woman. It could not exceed this amount to set a bad precedent, etc. Today, the Consular Court announced that the Municipal Council should compensate the plaintiff for a loss of 9,400 yuan, including litigation costs. According to the defendant's lawyer, the litigation costs exceeded 10,000 yuan. Also, the court fees should be paid by the Municipal Council, amounting to several hundred yuan. It is heard that during the litigation, the Municipal Council had offered 25,000 yuan to settle the case, but the defendant did not agree.</p>
<h3>Large Fishing Boat Sunk by Wind and Waves Off Daji Mountain</h3>
<p>Mast Broken, Boat Damaged, Seawater Rushes In, Drifting to Deserted Island, Loss of 2,000</p>
<p>Xia Xiaochun, a Ningbo native, 44 years old, lives in Changshan, his ancestral home. He inherited a three-masted fishing boat, with Xia himself as the captain. The crew consisted of Xia Abiao, Xia Daqi, Xia Achang, and others, all of the same clan. The boat operated along the coast, carrying goods for business. On the 7th of this month, they were hired by merchants in Ningbo to load 5,000 bundles of firewood and transport them to Xiaoshan for sale. After two days of sailing, the boat arrived off Daji Mountain when it was hit by a large storm. They tried to steer to the coast for refuge, but it was too late. They struggled at sea for two or three hours before the mast broke, the boat was damaged, and seawater rushed in. The entire boat and its cargo sank into the sea. All the firewood was lost. Xia and the four crew members climbed onto a small sampan and drifted with the tide. After a day and night, they floated to a small deserted island. The four men abandoned the boat and landed, surviving on grass and other plant fruits. They spent the night on the island, enduring great suffering. Until the morning of the 14th of this month, a Customs meteor cruiser passed by the island. The four men waved objects and shouted for help. After a while, the crew on the ship noticed and sent a small boat to rescue the four men to the ship. However, they had not eaten or warmed themselves for several days, looked emaciated, and were exhausted. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the meteor ship returned to Shanghai and sent the four men to the water police station. After questioning, the owner of the boat, Xia Xiaochun, stated that the boat was old, estimated to be worth 1,200 yuan, the firewood was worth about 500 yuan, and the items on board were worth several hundred yuan, for a total loss of 2,000 yuan. The captain sent detectives to the Ningbo Tongxiang Association in Shanghai to provide assistance in returning to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>Problems with Lost Items in Luggage Cars on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>Investigation Shows Not Theft, Railway Bureau Has Already Compensated</p>
<p>Regarding the theft that occurred in the luggage car on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway the day before yesterday, according to the English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," yesterday afternoon (the 18th), fifteen pieces of luggage in the luggage car of the express train from Beijing to Shanghai were pried open by thieves. It is reported that the value of the lost valuables and cash is about 50,000 yuan. The owners have already filed loss reports with the railway bureau requesting compensation. The actual amount is not yet known. The thieves entered by drilling a hole in the bottom of the car and are believed to have gotten off the train in Suzhou and fled. The incident was discovered at 9:26 PM last night when the train arrived at the North Station and the luggage department staff began working. The door of the car was unlocked, and upon inspection, fifteen pieces of luggage were found to have been pried open, with items scattered all over the floor. There was a large hole in the bottom of the car. However, most of the sturdy boxes and some baskets were untouched. The station police went to the scene to investigate, but found no clues. The opened boxes are now being kept by the railway bureau for investigation. The owners can inspect the lost items and report them to the railway bureau. One female passenger had already inspected her opened box last night and claimed to have lost several pieces of jewelry, a bank deposit book, and 30 yuan in cash. The woman had planned to go to Fujian today, but now has to postpone her trip. It is heard that this is the second theft on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. The first time, the car guard committed suicide due to depression. According to further investigation, the luggage belonged to a certain Western passenger. They said that there were no valuables inside, and that due to the old age of one or two boxes, they were shaken and broken during handling, causing the contents to spill out and be lost. After the railway bureau staff explained this to them, they were given some compensation and the matter was settled.</p>

<h3>China Economic Cooperation Society to Relocate</h3>
<p>And Plan to Establish a Family Consumer Cooperative</p>
<p>The China Economic Credit Insurance Cooperative in this city has been established for four years. The chairman of the cooperative, Zhang Shouyong, has always promoted cooperative enterprises and is responsible for the cooperative's affairs with his personal reputation, which is why it is highly trusted by the outside world. Two years ago, due to the depressed market, the cooperative did not proceed with various affairs. Now, seeing the market active and the government actively promoting cooperation, the director and manager of the cooperative, Qiu Hanping, and Liu Daofang, Zheng Daren, Zhao Xiguang, and others, have decided to develop the business in accordance with the cooperative's regulations. In addition to publishing a cooperative newsletter, they have specially established a family consumer cooperative to handle daily necessities to meet the needs of cooperative members' families, and plan to add an economic reading club, an item procurement department, and extracurricular entertainment. They have found a three-story building at 533 Foch Road (intersection of Avenue du Sacré-Cœur) as the cooperative's location. It is being renovated and is scheduled to open on the first day of next month. All of the cooperative's offices originally located in the Women's Building on Nanjing Road will also be moved to the new cooperative location at the same time. They are implementing the spirit of practicality to seek the welfare of cooperative members and to implement urban cooperation.</p>
<h3>Continuing Report on the Six Deaths in a Tragedy on Wuzhen Road, Zhabei</h3>
<p>Local Court Performs Second Autopsy Yesterday, Second Landlord's Daughter Voluntarily Turns Herself In and Confesses</p>
<p>The fire that occurred in the morning the day before yesterday at No. 13 Fudeli, across from the small vegetable market on Wuzhen Road, Zhabei, which resulted in the tragic deaths of six men, women, old, and young, and the sudden death of an elderly man, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Shanghai Local Court, in addition to dispatching Prosecutor Wang JiaMei, accompanied by clerk Wang Guancheng, to the scene to autopsy the bodies of Li Wangshi and Wang's three sons, Jin Longshun and Longshun, at around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, dispatched Prosecutor Huang Meiqing, clerk Zhou Yiping, and Shen, the coroner, for a second autopsy at around 11:00 AM yesterday because there were two more bodies that were discovered after the first autopsy. After investigation by Baojia Shen Xiaowu, it was determined that the last two bodies discovered were one male, named Lu Guixing, 40 years old, and one female, named Lu Aichen, 31 years old, both from Shaoxing. Lu Aichen was Lu Guixing's mistress. Prosecutor Huang and others then separately confirmed that both had been burned to death, filled out the corpse identification forms, and handed the corpses over to the Baojia for proper disposal. At around 2:00 PM, the daughter of the second landlord, Xie Songtao (Xie Jianzhang), named Xiuzhen, suddenly voluntarily turned herself in, claiming to be 20 years old, from Songjiang. Her family lived with three families in total. The front building was rented to the Li family, which included the mother and three sons who were burned to death. The back building was rented to the Lu family, where Lu Guixing and Lu Aichen lived. Aichen was out running errands at night (known as "tangbai"). On this particular night, she did not get any business. When she returned home, her mistress lit a fire to make her some snacks, and her newly bought two tins of kerosene, one of which belonged to the front building, somehow caused the fire. After the fire started, she immediately fled to her sister's husband's house on Xinmin Road. Her mother, Chen, is 60 years old and is burning incense in Hangzhou. Her father, Xie Jianzhang, 56 years old, was sleeping in the living room. She was sleeping behind the living room. After the fire started, neighbors told her that her father had also fled, wearing only a single short shirt and barefoot. She has come today to state that they were not the cause of the fire and that her father's whereabouts are unknown. It is also reported that a six-inch Browning pistol, number 134832, containing live ammunition, was found at the scene of the fire the day before yesterday. It had exploded and was handed over to the police station. It is said that it belonged to the Li family in the front building.</p>
<h3>Upper Yangtze River Water Levels Low, Night Navigation Prohibited Starting Today</h3>
<p>Between Yuezhou and Yichang, Within Waterway No. 16</p>
<p>The Upper Yangtze River water levels are low this year. Due to the spring floods, the sections of Jiujiang, Yichang, and Yuezhou are also affected by low water levels. The Shanghai Customs announced yesterday that night navigation is prohibited and that stopping, yielding, and collision avoidance measures have been implemented. The six companies in the city have been notified, and the announcement is as follows: ㊀ Jiujiang Section: Near the Jianglong Reef lightship, all upstream vessels should, when they see a downstream vessel approaching the Jianglong lightship, immediately wait on the right side of the waterway, three-quarters of a nautical mile below the Jianglong lightship. They must wait until the downstream vessel has completely passed before proceeding upstream. Otherwise, there is a risk of running into the Jianglong reef and causing a major accident. ㊁ Yueyi Section: Within Waterway No. 16, due to the rapid drop in water levels, all upstream and downstream vessels may pass through the waterway during the day from half an hour after sunrise to half an hour after sunset. Night navigation is prohibited. Upstream vessels approaching the waterway should, when they see a downstream vessel, temporarily stop on the right side of the waterway below the downstream limit of the waterway, and proceed upstream only after the downstream vessel has completely passed. This will be implemented starting today (April 18). The shipping companies in the city have received this announcement and have notified all Yangtze River shipowners to comply.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Pays Attention to Pedestrian Safety, Widely Posting Warning Slogans</h3>
<p>Saying "You Only Live Once"</p>
<p>The Public Concession authorities, recognizing the importance of traffic, have been working hard to promote various new traffic facilities and measures in recent years, with considerable success. The council now believes that these new facilities should be actively promoted, especially to make citizens understand that, in addition to the yellow pedestrian lanes painted on the main thoroughfares, warnings are being widely posted to attract citizens' attention, hoping to reduce unfortunate traffic incidents. These warning posters are written in both Chinese and Western languages, and are printed in color. The words are eye-catching and moving, such as "You only live once, you should walk on the yellow pedestrian lane" and "You only live once, you should walk when the green light is on," etc.</p>

<h3>Zheng Xihua Applies for Mediation to Annul Mute Marriage</h3>
<p>Deaf and Dumb Student Under Seventeen Years Old, His Father is Wealthy But Unwilling to Marry</p>
<p>Young woman Zheng Xihua, 20 years old, from Chaozhou, currently residing at No. 3 Jingmingli, Fuyou Road, Xinkai River, has hired lawyers Yuan Yangan et al. to file a lawsuit in the local court against her husband, Chen Huanzhen (18 years old, a mute, residing at No. 8 Yonganli, Xueyuan Road, within the city, whose father, Chen Zhihou, owns Guangchang Jinghuo Store on Tianzhutang Street and Yonghe Pawnshop at the intersection of Yongan Street and Minguo Road, possessing assets of over 200,000), seeking the annulment of the illegal marriage. Yesterday, Judge Wang Run opened a mediation hearing. Lawyers Yuan Yangan et al., representing Zheng Xihua, stated the facts, saying that the petitioner was betrothed to Chen Huanzhen through parental arrangement in the 15th year of the Republic. At this time, the petitioner was still a young girl, unaware of anything. Suddenly, in January of last year, there was talk of marriage, and after the marriage was completed, it was discovered that the other party was a deaf-mute child under the age of sixteen, who was violent and domineering, relying on his wealth to bully others. Even during the honeymoon, he would brutally beat her for minor reasons. Unable to bear the abuse, the petitioner had no choice but to take refuge in her mother's home. Although the other party is now nominally eighteen years old, having been born in May of the 9th year of the Republic, he is actually not yet seventeen years old. According to Articles 980, 989, and 999, Section 12 of the Civil Code, a man who is not yet eighteen years old may not marry, and violation of this is grounds for annulment, and compensation should be paid for the damages suffered as a result of the annulment. The petitioner, for the sake of her own legal interests, should exercise her right to annul the marriage in accordance with the law, and incidentally request the return of the dowry, compensation for damages, and consolation money, totaling 19,889 yuan in national currency. It was also stated that Chen Huanzhen is currently studying at the Longhua School for the Deaf and Dumb. Because Chen Huanzhen did not arrive, the mediation was unsuccessful, and a formal lawsuit will be filed.</p>
<h3>Xue Xinqi Used Opportunities to Deceive Female Depositors into Lending Money</h3>
<p>The Four Banks Savings Society Suspended Him from His Position; He Even Intended to Shift the Blame to His Wife</p>
<p>Zhang Qinghua, a Wuxi woman residing at No. 24, Lane 1603, Jing'an Temple Road (currently 47 years old), had some savings, most of which were deposited in the Four Banks Savings Society. Because she frequently went to the bank to withdraw and deposit money, she became acquainted with Xue Xinqi, a Wuxi native and staff member in the Teller Department. On August 1st of last year, Xue suddenly visited Zhang Qinghua's home with his wife, Xue Wu, claiming that Zhu Zhongzhang, a colleague in the bank, was short of funds for his sister's wedding and requested a loan of 300 yuan. Zhang agreed, drew up a loan agreement, and stipulated that the loan term would be six months, with interest calculated as a pawnshop loan. On the 28th of the same month, Xue and his wife went again, claiming that their friend Ye Jitang needed 300 yuan due to the birth of a child and asked for a loan through them. Zhang again lent the money as before, with the same procedures. On September 30th, Xue borrowed another 1,000 yuan from Zhang in the name of Ye Jitang. On February 1st of this year, when Zhu Zhongzhang's loan was due, Zhang went to the Four Banks Savings Society to ask Xue for repayment. Xue kept making excuses, and the so-called debtor, Zhu Zhongzhang, was not allowed to meet. Later, Zhang called Zhu Zhongzhang, but there was no Zhu Zhongzhang in the bank, only Zhu Zhongchang. However, Zhu Zhongchang absolutely denied entrusting Xue to borrow money on his behalf. Zhang also sent a letter to Ye Jitang to inquire, but Ye also denied borrowing money. Zhang then went to the Four Banks Savings Society and argued with Xue, which led to Xue's recent suspension from his position by the bank. Zhang then reported the matter to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Hua, a detective, arrested Xue Xinqi and Xue Wu at No. 41, Lane 685, Gordon Road, the day before yesterday and confiscated many seals of Zhu Zhongzhang and the guarantors on the loan agreements. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special First Court, where Judge Huang Risheng interrogated them. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, stated the case, prosecuting them for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law and forgery under Article 210 of the same law, and claiming that the plaintiff used the surname Yang for the first two loans and the surname Cui for the third loan. When Xue Xinqi was questioned, he claimed that all three loans were made by his wife and that he had never been consulted. Xue Wu, however, admitted that she did it all herself because she had lost money buying aviation lottery tickets and betting on dog races. Judge Huang, after verifying the confessions, ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody. The case was postponed for a week, pending the summons of Zhu Shenchang and Ye Jitang to testify before further interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Hua An Cooperative Life Insurance Company Hosted a Banquet for Loovink Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Hua An Cooperative Life Insurance Company held a banquet at noon yesterday on the eighth floor of the company to entertain Mr. Loovink, Director of the East Asia Affairs Department of the Netherlands East Indies government. Guests attending the banquet included Loovink, the Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai, Boetzelaer van Oosterhout, Mu Ouchu, Xi Yushu, Lü Yuequan, Lu Wenshao, Pan Zhiwen, Chen Zixin, Jing Qiankun, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Lü Weiping, Ding Jianqiao, Wang Liangti, Gong Huibai, Sheng Pihua, Chen Sidu, Yang Zhisheng, Lu Jinwen, Lu Zhaozhang, Lü Weifan, Lü Weihan, and more than twenty others. During the banquet, the company's General Manager, Mr. Lü Yuequan, delivered a welcome speech, which was translated by Mr. Jing Qiankun, saying, "Today, the Board of Directors of this company has prepared a simple banquet to welcome Mr. Loovink, Director of the East Asia Affairs Department of the Netherlands East Indies government, and Mr. Boetzelaer van Oosterhout, the Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai. We are extremely honored that Mr. Loovink and Mr. Boetzelaer van Oosterhout have graced us with their presence. Our company was established in 1912 and began expanding its business abroad in 1925, first establishing a branch office in Batavia, Java, in the Dutch East Indies, and then a branch office in Medan, Sumatra. For more than ten years, we have been treated favorably by the Dutch East Indies government and have received much care from Mr. Loovink, enabling our company's business in the Dutch East Indies to develop fully and prosper. We are extremely grateful for this high regard and friendship. Furthermore, I recently visited Southeast Asia and was impressed by the excellent politics, cultural progress, clean streets, and magnificent buildings in the cities. All industries are thriving, which I deeply admire. What moved me most was that during my interactions in Southeast Asia, I found the Dutch people to be kind, amiable, and courteous. When I had the honor of visiting Mr. Loovink, I received a cordial reception, and his sincere attitude was evident in his words. I recall that at a banquet in Batavia, Dr. Van Rappard gave a sincere speech, saying that China and foreign countries are one family, without distinction of race. This can truly demonstrate genuine friendship. The life insurance industry is still in its infancy in our country, but in the Dutch East Indies, the Dutch people, with their advanced culture, deeply understand the benefits of life insurance in providing for old age, death, and economic security for families. It is a career that seeks happiness for the people, so they value the life insurance industry more than any other. The government's promotion and supervision are also tireless. When I was in Batavia, I visited the Netherlands Life Insurance Company and saw its grand scale, abundant assets, and rapid business development. However, its General Manager told me that although the company had been established for seventy years, its expertise was no different from that of a child. His words are truly worth pondering. What I admire most is that the Dutch East Indies government highly values the life insurance industry and treats Chinese and foreign companies equally. This shows the Dutch people's broad-mindedness and great spirit. This time, Mr. Loovink is passing through Shanghai on business, and our company is very happy to have this opportunity to fulfill our duty as host. I propose a toast to Mr. Loovink's health and Mr. Boetzelaer van Oosterhout's health." Mr. Loovink then delivered a thank-you speech, which was translated by Mr. Yang Zhisheng. He began by saying that he was deeply grateful to the Board of Directors of the company for inviting him and the Consul-General to such a magnificent feast and praising words, which could not be expressed in words. He then said that Mr. Lü's praise of the Dutch East Indies government and himself for supporting the company was, in fact, the Dutch East Indies government's duty to protect the company's business in the Dutch East Indies. As for his own duty to answer any inquiries from the company, the company's progress was due to its own efforts. He did not dare to accept Mr. Lü's praise of the Dutch East Indies government and himself. He also said that Mr. Lü had mentioned that he had seen the grand scale and abundant assets of the Netherlands Life Insurance Company in Southeast Asia and that the company had been established for seventy years. Now, the company only has twenty-five years of history, but it has already achieved such results. When it reaches seventy years, its results will be better than those of the Netherlands Life Insurance Company. He also thanked Mr. Lü for praising the excellent politics and cultural progress of the Dutch East Indies. In fact, China's political construction in recent years has been making rapid progress, and its progress is truly admirable. The company's sound management also made a very good impression on him. The company's promotion of life insurance in the Dutch East Indies is beneficial to the people. When he returns to the Dutch East Indies soon, he will report his observations to the people of the Dutch East Indies in detail. He wishes everyone good health and the company prosperity. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed at four o'clock.</p>

<h3>Jia Yi Sues Ding Xudong and Others for Conspiracy to Coerce Written Agreements; Witnesses Testified and the Trial Concluded</h3>
<p>Classmate Du Ernan Acted as Scribe for Testimony; Zhang Suzhen Added a Security Deposit of 500 Yuan</p>
<p>Lawyer Jia Yi sued Zhang Suzhen, a young woman from Suzhou, and lawyer Ding Xudong in the local court, accusing them of using a "honey trap" method to coerce him into writing two agreements severing their cohabitation relationship and stating that he owed her 280 yuan at the Southeast Hotel in Beinicheng Bridge. After investigation by Prosecutor Jiang, a public prosecution was filed. Yesterday morning, Judge Lu Hongyi continued the trial and summoned witness Du Ernan, 32 years old, residing at No. 15, Hepingli, Avenue Edward VII, who is Jia Yi's classmate. When the incident occurred, I was eating at Ding Xudong's place. Jia Yi called Ding and asked him to come. Because of our classmate friendship, I went with him. When we arrived at the Southeast Hotel, I saw Jia with Zhang Suzhen and two other men. I asked what happened. Jia said that the woman was his client and that he had had a relationship with her in Suzhou. Now, the woman was asking him for money. The rest was about mediating the amount of money. At that time, Zhang said that Jia owed her money, but Jia said he didn't. In the end, they agreed on 280 yuan and wrote an agreement. Ding Xudong was only helping to mediate. I wrote the agreement on his behalf, Ding Xudong drafted it, and Jia Yi read and revised it before it was finalized. Zhang Jinsheng, a waiter at the Southeast Hotel, testified that he was 30 years old. Jia Yi and Zhang Suzhen came first, and then two other people came later. Jia made a phone call. I didn't hear what they were talking about in the room, but when Jia and Zhang arrived, they closed the door. Later, I didn't hear any arguing in the room. Ding Xudong testified that I drafted the agreement, which Du Ernan wrote on his behalf. Jia Yi read it before it was finalized. The court debate concluded, and the judgment will be announced on the 22nd. Zhang Suzhen added a security deposit of 500 yuan.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>The Evolution of "Cherishing Time"</h3>
<p>— Chen Fu</p>
<p>When I was a child, there was a subject called "Self-Cultivation" in school textbooks, which taught children great principles to prepare them for adulthood and serve as golden rules for establishing oneself in the world. I still remember some of these principles, one of which was "cherishing every inch of time." The book depicted a dignified ancient person rolling up his sleeves and moving wine jars in the courtyard, with the caption "Tao Kan Moving Jars," using the diligence and time-consciousness of the ancients as a model for future generations. However, at the time, I was very skeptical: since he had free time, why didn't he go out and play? I didn't understand what good it was to move wine jars in and out every day. It wasn't until the "Saving the Nation Through Earnest Study" theory was invented in the past two years that I understood a little bit. It probably meant telling children to not fool around when they were free and to move wine jars in the courtyard to cherish time.</p>
<p>The theory of "cherishing time" has not been heard for a long time. "Self-Cultivation" has also been renamed. However, the spirit of the Chinese people must continue, but the statement has been greatly changed, proving that the times are indeed progressing. It says that young people must be diligent in establishing themselves in the world, cherish time, and work hard to increase work efficiency. "When we do things, although it is for others, it is also for ourselves. What we give to others is achievement, and what we give to ourselves is experience. Therefore, less achievement also means less experience." To climb steadily upwards, to move forward honestly, to mind one's own business, and to do more serious things, this is "the demand of society, and also a good way to catch up."</p>
<p>However, there is even more!</p>
<p>With the severity of the national crisis, young people are no longer very content. Moving wine jars is certainly good, but what about the loss of thousands of miles of land, and the voice of "friendship" is still rising? If you want to "strive for progress," unfortunately, there is no way to go, and there is no way to set foot in the "office." Fortunately, those who occupy a seat in the "office" can diligently "catch up." But they are also afraid that before they catch up, they will become people of a conquered nation, and everything will be over. Therefore, the instructors come to guide again, saying that the country must be saved, but the way to save the country is to "each do their best and each use their strength."</p>
<p>The argument is not new, and can be said to be an evolution of the "Saving the Nation Through Study" theory. But the essence of this argument is that the progress of a country must be promoted through balanced development in all aspects, and not just a special force can be competent. Therefore, all true old-fashioned patriots must not ask about politics, and each seek development from their own business.</p>
<p>The words are right. Saving the country naturally requires studying. If all the people of a country are idle and irresponsible, it would be too bad. But making merchants diligent in their business and farmers diligent in their farming is the same as not necessarily being able to save the country by reading in a room. Moreover, according to the current situation, there are probably not many young people who are so absurd and degenerate, or who are employed and do not know how to "do their best and each use their strength," so there is no need for so much instruction. - The Chinese people's hesitation and suffering are not here.</p>
<p>From the "Theory of Cherishing Time" to the "Theory of Saving the Nation in One's Own Position," the appearance is different, but the use is the same: to call on young people to be content with their own position and not to ask about national affairs. It is certainly okay for young people to listen to this argument, but if they trust it, they will be greatly fooled!</p>
<h3>Mulberry Fields</h3>
<p>— Tianshe</p>
<p>Let's count, how many families in the village raise silkworms? Shu Baoshu's family, the clan chief's family, Lai Li Shoufu's family, and is there anyone else? Crooked-mouth Afu's family is half-dead, and whether they will raise them or not is still undecided, it's very miserable, and you can't even count them on one finger. Speaking of which, raising silkworms is really not easy these days. Before, it was said that you could at least guarantee your capital, but in recent years, it's been difficult to even guarantee your capital. You hope for this year and then hope for next year, and you work hard year after year, but in the end, it's all for nothing. From hatching silkworm ants to going up the mountain after three moults, is there hope? It's hanging in mid-air.</p>
<p>The mulberry fields inside and outside the village are decreasing year by year. Diligent owners loosen the soil and plant rape, melon seedlings, and build bean trellises and pig pens. Lazy owners let them lie fallow, with weeds growing, mulberry trees being蛀ed and枯, being felled and burned as firewood. Of the few remaining first fruits, the leaves are useless when they grow up, and people pick them to wipe their bottoms in the outhouse. In summer, they are picked to wrap pickled cucumbers and send to relatives, or to cover fish and shrimp. In winter, the leaves turn yellow from the frost, and women pick them all, throw them in rush bags, carry them to the street, and sell them to pharmacies for only a few hundred coins a load, which can be considered a little bit of income among the useless. But what can this little bit of livelihood do? Buying a pair of shoe bands, weighing a pound of salt, buying four ounces of oil, and buying a few sesame cakes to bring to the children are still not enough.</p>
<p>It's really different from the scene when I was a child. When I was a child, our village was surrounded by dense mulberry trees, and you could only see the white-powdered roof ridge of the ancestral hall in the distance, and the crow's nest on the roof ridge. Most of the village houses were short. Not to mention that the village was obscured by the green shade in the three seasons of spring, summer, and autumn, but even in the withering winter, the withered and bare mulberry branches around the village seemed to become a natural fence. Several sounds of chickens crowing, dogs barking, and children singing loudly in the field came from within the fence. The true face of the village was completely invisible. From the many fertile mulberry fields, you could see the wealth, prosperity, diligence, and abundant harvest of our village. In March of the spring, when the silkworm ants hatched and were fed leaves, people began to go to the mulberry fields to pick leaves. "How many sheets of seeds did your family hatch this year?" "Three and a half sheets, your family hatched a lot?" "Not much, there aren't enough people to handle it." "Your (wife or husband) is diligent, mine is useless."... These questions and answers could be heard in the mulberry fields, and everyone contained a kind of pleasant feeling of working for life.</p>
<p>Now isn't it the time when silkworm ants hatch? Not to mention that you can't hear those pleasant questions and answers anymore, even the natural fences have been dismantled one after another, and you can see the dilapidated mill house in the village from afar, the factory hall with only a door rail and no door, and the thatch houses of a few families at the end of the village, their shapes appearing very desolate and deserted. It's just like a tuberculosis patient, getting thinner and thinner, gradually revealing blue veins, jawbones, and cheekbones, presenting a picture of exhaustion. How many families are relatively better off, without worrying about food and fuel? Shu Baoshu, the clan chief, Lai Li Shoufu... These three or four families have a better foundation and a little face outside, so they can turn around more flexibly. As for mulberry fields and raising silkworms, only they are left. In fact, they don't rely on this season's silkworm production. Raising them is just to show that they are "big families." The mulberry leaves are readily available, the farmhands are readily available, and if the cocoon price is good, they are happy to make some money. If it's not good, they peel them off themselves to weave silk and pull silk cotton. This kind of situation can no longer be done in other families.</p>
<p>"Borrowing money to raise silkworms doesn't count your own labor. If you lose even your capital, it's better to sit still, anyway, it's a dead end!" Big Dogzi Along often nags like this, and recently sold that one-acre-four-point mulberry field to Lai Li Shoufu. "Instead of raising silkworms and having the cocoons飞priced by the big bosses, I don't plan to raise silkworms in this life. The big bosses make steady money and scrape our skin. My old man didn't have such瘟!" Changgen also said with gritted teeth. The seven or eight large silkworm racks piled in the hall were all chopped up and used as firewood. Even the old woman in the loft couldn't understand this reason. She told people everywhere: "These days, lake crepe silk is going straight up in price. Buying three large clothes materials for the second girl costs more than ten yuan. The先生 in the silk and satin shop kept saying that the silk漲 has gone up in price. Why should silkworm raisers have one hundred and twenty-four霉 unlucky things happen to them? As soon as the cocoons are weighed, the trade says that the silk is cheap?"</p>
<p>But no one could give her a clear explanation. "Old lady (honorific), you can still afford to spend more than ten yuan to prepare clothes for your千金小姐 when she gets married. Like us, we can only cut down mulberry trees and sell mulberry fields to live!" Big Dogzi Along replied to her with these few words, half satirizing and half self-pitying. The old scholar who sat in the ancestral hall often put his hands behind his back and shook his head and sighed: "Alas, the old words in the book have been reflected, '沧海桑田', now it will be '桑田沧海' again...!" But no one could understand the meaning contained in his words.</p>
<h3>Sound Printing Machine</h3>
<p>— (Guowei)</p>
<p>At present, the speed of printing machines for printing newspapers and books is already very fast, but after all, the work of typesetting and platemaking is still too troublesome, so someone has invented a method of using speech to make plates; you only need to ask someone to stand in front of a增音器 (Microphone) and read out the text to be printed. A type of film (the same as the film for sound movies) records these texts. Then, the writing on the film is moved to another film, and the two films are combined. A machine is used to copy the writing onto a lead sheet, which becomes a printing plate. Mass printing can be done immediately, saving an unknown amount of time. Therefore, some people predict that in the near future, newspaper offices will be able to山报 at any time, and writers will only need to read their manuscripts once. In less than ten minutes, their works will be on sale in bookstores. How convenient.</p>
<h3>Homecoming</h3>
<p>— Bai Yan</p>
<p>He only woke up when he arrived at Willow Village, sat up straight and asked where they were. He then opened the sedan curtain and looked out. The sky was overcast, and even the faint starlight was invisible tonight. The wind howled mournfully, and fallen leaves flew from the tangled forest on the mountain peak. The carriage crept along a small path at the foot of the mountain. The donkey snorted once or twice.</p>
<p>"How much farther to Stone River Market?"</p>
<p>"Just around this mountain bend, not much further."</p>
<p>After the coachman finished speaking, he stuffed his pipe back into his mouth and flicked his whip absentmindedly. As they passed Fortune Bridge, a few scattered adobe houses squatted in the deep darkness. In the reed bushes by the stream, a fishing boat flashed with light. Far away south of the bridge at Lu's Marsh, the sound of bamboo poles pushing through the water could be faintly heard. It was probably a boat smuggling contraband.</p>
<p>Clang, clang, clang, the carriage rattled along the stony road, nearing the sloping city wall. Once inside the city, most of the shops were already closed. Only a few small snack stalls remained, their half-lit oil lamps casting a faint yellow glow in the sheltered corners of the street. Passing through an alley lined with opium dens, a silent, deep darkness prevailed. Two or three hunchbacked figures, like ghosts, wandered through. Occasionally, the barking of dogs floated over, making the silence even more desolate.</p>
<p>He jumped out of the carriage in front of the old pine tree at his gate. A kerosene lamp hung dimly in the gatehouse, flickering in the night wind, almost extinguished. He greeted the old servant who guarded the ancestral home. The old man tottered down the stone steps, bowing deeply, rubbing his bleary eyes with his large sleeves. The wrinkles on his face formed a naive smile.</p>
<p>"Heavens, Master, you've come back."</p>
<p>The young man looked down from the lamplight, smiling at the old man who had played with him since he was a toddler, and explained why he was so late in arriving home today, because of the heavy rain he encountered at the station last night. The old man was a little deaf, and he just muttered something endlessly. As he walked out of the round moon gate, the young man who had been away from his old home for so long, saw that the brick walls on the east side had collapsed, and he was treading on artemisia. He had not imagined that the garden would be so desolate. He remembered the vegetable patch that his mother cultivated when he was a child, the morning sun shining on the golden rape flowers, many unnamed vegetable seedlings, emitting a bright green color... At night, the locust flowers released a wisp of fragrance under the moonlight, and his mother would watch those watering the garden morning and evening. How could it only be a few years...</p>
<p>He sat in a room with dust-covered walls, his luggage piled on the floor. A small hand lamp sat on the table. He wearily held his head in his hands, leaning against the table, and in the silence, he remembered when he parted with his old father ten years ago. The old man, with white hair and beard, leaned on a cane and trembled as he saw him off. His mother smiled bitterly and held his hand, reluctant to let go for a long time, repeatedly urging him to "come back soon". That misty image was now ten years ago. He sighed softly and looked up:</p>
<p>"Does anyone look after my father's and mother's graves?"</p>
<p>The old servant coughed repeatedly,</p>
<p>"Old Master's grave at Yellow Mountain Fortress? I'm old, I can't walk. I haven't been to the grave for three whole years."</p>
<p>He silently rubbed his eyes and waved for the old man to go to sleep. He lit a bright red candle himself, took the candlestick, and lazily walked into the bedroom.</p>
<p>The old grandfather clock in the main room was probably rusty. He didn't know what time it was now. The wind howled against the window paper, and the night grew darker in this small town.</p>
<h3>Sai Jinhua (13)</h3>
<p>— Written by Chen He</p>
<p>When foreigners were invading, Qing Qiu did not think of the people's nurturing grace, to protect the people, defend the country, and strive for the survival of the nation. Instead, they took advantage of the crisis, looted the people's property, and framed good people. No different from being a tool for the imperial court to suppress the people, and a vanguard for corrupt officials to exploit the people. Worse than a rabble. When they saw foreign soldiers, their feet turned to the sky; when they saw good people, their smiles blossomed. This is truly the greatest sinner of a ruined country and lost territory! Sai Jinhua, escaping from disaster, encountered such a degenerate creature and was already penniless. The long journey is far away! How can small feet walk with nothing! The days pass, the stars turn! How can a hungry stomach wait! People in distress! People in distress! What will you do?</p>
