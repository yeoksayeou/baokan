<h3>敵襲後路計劃失敗獅子林竟日猛烈血戰</h3>
<p>截至今晨五時戰事猶未停　羅店竄入之敵已完全殲滅　張華浜等處敵軍悉數掃蕩</p>
<p>（本報特訊）最近兩日來、戰事重心、移至吳淞沿岸、敵應援軍兩師團、窺伺多日、乘隙偷渡、抄襲我軍後方，幸我軍早有充分準備、連日一部份在張華浜·蘊藻浜·吳淞砲台灣·獅子林·等海口登陸之敵軍、均經我軍奮勇迎頭擊退、零星殘敵、現集中獅子林負嵎頑抗、另一部份約千餘人、間道竄至羅店鎭、經我軍重重包圍、激戰半日、完全殲滅、獅子林方面、自昨午起、展開最猛烈之血戰、雙方肉搏衝擊、敵遺屍遍野、截至今晨五時、戰事迄未停止、據某軍事專家言、獅子林之敵、根據雙方軍力之比較、與夫所處地理之形勢、敵全部消滅、僅爲時間問題、絕不能予我方軍事有任何牽制、故毫不足慮也、</p>
<p>敵軍於二十二日以迄二十三日晨、偷襲吳淞張華浜·蕰藻浜·瀏河·及楊林口·等處、企圖登陸、當經我軍奮勇迎擊、戰事異常劇烈、敵終不支、狼狽而退、惟敵軍登陸之企圖、並未因此而消滅、乃於前晚（二十三日）特派一旅團之衆、在敵艦密集、砲火掩護之下、猛攻我吳淞砲台灣一帶、並有少數敵軍偷渡登陸、我軍沉着應戰以機關槍密集掃射、並以重砲還擊、旋我空軍飛至助戰、猛劇轟炸、敵軍經我陸空軍之夾擊、傷亡奇重、血戰至昨晨三時許、我軍卒將敵軍痛擊潰退、敵軍之登陸企圖、完全失敗、</p>
<p>又訊、昨（二十四日）晨四時許、天將拂曉時、又有敵軍約三千人前來犯境、在砲台灣洋碼頭迤東沿塘至石梗一帶、蜂擁登陸、因該處係面積頗廣之沙灘、卽海水浴塲地帶、故容易上岸、當時我軍毫不動靜、俟敵軍全部登陸後、突出伏兵包圍、用機關槍奮勇掃擊、取三面夾攻勢、激戰三小時餘、敵軍死傷大半、始向沙灘潰退、紛紛躍上汽艇、駛往三峽水逸去我軍奪獲敵械不少、尚有獅子林及吳淞對江白龍江等處海面敵艦頗多、時有登陸之企圖、故我軍在各該地派有重兵駐守、昨日敵艦上除發砲掩護軍隊上陸外其他砲戰時間不多、下午砲聲稀少、因敵軍膽怯、不敢白天偷襲、且我軍沿海陣地鞏固、敵艦終難得逞、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）昨日午後本埠某輪公司、接到被阻在裏銅沙之某外輪電告、言昨日吳淞戰事之烈、砲火之猛、華軍迎擊之勇、殊難言述、午刻戰事最烈時、華軍有空軍一隊、飛至吳淞海面、冒險擲彈、轟炸日本滿載援軍之運輸艦、因是發生空中戰爭、機槍子彈、亂飛海空、間有落至船畔者、直至下午四時、吳淞口槍砲聲稍息、怡隆洋行之神福輪、卽首先冒險開進、至晚方到金利源碼頭停泊、寗興及新北京、猶未能開進、須今晨八時至滬、蓋工部局與駐滬日海軍司令商定、凡懸外國旗之運載難民輪、每天規定上午八時及下午三時、可以通過吳淞、若在激戰時、（如昨日情形）雖有規定、亦不能進出、</p>
<p>登陸敵軍痛遭打擊</p>
<p>確息、前日（廿三日）上午四時左右、敵以一旅團之衆、在多數兵艦强烈砲火掩護下、又在寶山川沙河口沿岸向我進犯、我守軍奮力守禦、拼死相持至六時左右、卒有敵軍一部乘隙登陸、向我陣地猛撲、自獅子林砲台至川沙河口沿岸、均發現敵踪、敵復以小部隊約六七百名、於敵我戰鬭激烈時、乘隙由川沙鎭經木杓橋向羅店鎭潛退時、我羅店守軍、接前方告急訊、已開抵盛家橘月浦鎭之綫、我控制於××地區之主力部隊、尚未到達羅店鎭、該處僅有極少數之留守部隊、抵抗無效、敵軍卽佔領該鎭、並在附近接築工事、拒止我援軍、下午二時許、我增援部隊、沿嘉羅路及滬太路到達前綫、當向羅店之敵、包圍痛擊、此時敵重兵器尚未全部展開、經我軍猛烈攻擊、敵掙扎一時許、全綫不支、一面縱火焚燒房屋、掩護退却、一面卽向原路退走、我軍跟踪追擊至川沙鎭附近、敵憑河抵抗、雙方隔河激戰、我軍由敵之右翼包圍、至全綫潰亂、四時許、我軍將敵軍全部殲滅、奪獲敵軍所用地圖及武器甚夥、敵傷亡枕籍、我軍將此綫之敵肅淸之後、卽沿江東下、進抵盛家橋前方時、我軍仍在與登陸之敵激戰中、我以極優勢之兵力、向敵側面猛攻、敵紛紛潰退、截至昨日（二十四）下午三時止、我軍仍在獅子林砲台舊址將敵包圍殲滅中、</p>
<h3>敵軍竄入羅店經我全部殲滅</h3>
<p>二百餘人均吿肅淸　敵機飛往擲彈起火</p>
<p>中央社、前日（二十三日）午刻、寶山縣境獅子林附近之石洞、突有大隊敵軍、在重砲及飛機掩護之下、偷渡登陸、我軍當卽奮勇迎擊、奈以敵方砲火密集、竟有敵軍二百餘人、突圍而出、竄入石洞附近之羅店鎭、旋我後方部隊、由□□□□兩地增援而至、夾擊進入羅店之敵軍、直至昨晨（二十四日）一時、已將進入羅店之敵、全部殲滅、我軍當卽進抵石洞、將該處之敵、加以肅淸、</p>
<p>中央社、寳山縣羅店鎭、商業原極繁盛、足爲全縣之冠、詎前日（二十三日）上午七時許、有敵機六架、飛往投擲硫磺彈、該鎭頓起大火、經救火人員全體出動施救、敵機對我救火人員用機關槍任意掃射、當塲被傷亡七人、以致火勢蔓延、所有該鎭熱鬧地帶、盡付一炬、昨日上午十時許、復有敵機數架、飛往投彈、均未命中、故損失無多、該縣旅滬同鄕會現正積極設法施救該縣難民出險、尙有嘉定縣城內外於前日亦有敵機飛往投彈、達六十餘枚之多、幸我方已有凖備、故無損失、</p>
<p>張華浜敵軍全擊退</p>
<p>據官方消息、二十三日上午十二時許、敵軍六七百人、由張華浜偷渡登陸、當經我軍以密集之機槍及猛烈之砲火、奮勇擊退、另有敵軍約一旅之衆、在寶山及川沙口（卽石洞）之間偷渡登陸、業經我大軍包圍、激戰甚烈、當時曾有少數之敵、於二十三日午後二時許、到達羅店、亦經我軍包圍、全部殲滅、並奪獲地圖多件、及武器甚多、</p>
<p>川沙開到敵航空艦</p>
<p>據確息、川沙縣北之徐家鎭海面、開到敵航空母艦一艘、其目的在隨時掩護敵軍、在我沿海口岸偷渡登陸、但我軍防地、異去鞏固、敵决難得逞、</p>
<p>我軍中路向西突進</p>
<p>（本報特訊）前晚敵援軍偷流登陸之後、本埠戰事中心、已由虹口而移往吳淞、故虹口前綫、昨晨較爲沉寂、元芳路兆豎路之綫、並無劇烈接觸、北面則虬江路方面有斷續之砲聲、匯山路華德路西牢左右、仍有相持不下之巷戰、我軍中路自到達匯山碼頭一帶之後、連日奮勇向西突進、一部到達梧州路、刻已進展至北新虹橋而與狄思威路方面之我軍銜接、一部到達東西華德路、亦已進展至虹橋河邊、敵軍退至外虹橋西百老匯路一帶、作最後掙扎、</p>
<p>佔據公動鐵廠之殘敵百餘人、業於前日完全被我軍殲滅、目前保定路華德路荊州路及塘山路一帶、均在我軍手中、並無敵蹤、由塘山路至昆明路一帶房屋、敵軍於退却時、縱火焚燒、幾已全化灰燼、</p>
<p>虹口東區戰事、昨晚官方消息如下、㊀由塘山路至昆明路之房屋、敵軍於退却時、縱火焚燒、幾全化爲灰爐、㊁塘山路一帶現全在我軍手中、㊂日軍公勤鐵廠之殘敵百餘人、於前昨兩日、完全被我軍殲滅、現保定路華德路荊州路一帶、已無敵踪、㊃尙在敵軍手中之楊榭浦沿浦各碼頭、被我砲兵轟燬甚多、殘敵損失極重、不敢進入碼頭內、現正在碼頭附近、加緊構築新工事、希圖死守、但軍心恐慌已極、關於虹口方面、困守虹口公園之殘敵、因已陷入重圍、將臨絕境、於二十三日傍晚起、接連三次、向我陣綫進攻、希圖衝出、均被我軍擊退、敵前後死傷達二百人、</p>
<p>我軍飛機三次夜襲</p>
<p>（本報特訊）昨晚九時二十分、我空軍於月光斜照、夜色蒼茫中、突然出現於浦江敵艦及虹口區敵軍陣地上空、敵猝不及防、倉皇失措、流星式之紅綠照空彈、及高射砲、聯珠齊發、五光閃爍、蔚爲大觀、但我空軍毫不介意、機聲且愈逼愈近、約歷一刻鐘之久、敵方高射砲更加密集、而同時我軍飛機、亦報以極猛烈之機關槍聲、詎一剎那間、突聞霹靂巨聲、震動遠近、蓋我軍飛機已擲下巨型炸彈矣、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）今晨零時十五分、我空軍飛機數架、又向浦江敵艦作第二次之夜襲、敵艦高射砲齊發、我飛機連續投彈五枚、內有一彈、炸聲異常宏脆、想係命中敵艦所致、我飛機轟炸約半小時之久、始從容向淞口方面飛去、乃敵驚魄甫定、方冀今日拂曉以前、我機决不致再度飛往、不料未及半小時、我空軍竟作第三度之奇襲、當時以敵軍高射砲無的亂放之情形、卽可覘知敵方倉皇紛亂之一斑、但此次我飛機僅迴旋約十餘分鐘、並未投彈、仍向東北方面而去、綜計我空軍三次夜襲、估計敵軍所耗去之高射砲彈、至少當在千發以上、</p>
<p>中央社、我機於昨晚飛往淞口夜襲敵艦之後、午夜由淞飛滬、在敵艦高射砲密射之中、從容投擲炸彈多枚、卽行安然離滬而返、</p>
<p>我機擊落敵機兩架</p>
<p>茲悉前晨九時、敵機企圖在吳淞一帶登岸被我軍痛擊時、我飛機二十七架、曾飛往助戰、除向敵艦投彈予以重傷外、並擊落敵機兩架、</p>
<p>敵機昨晨偵察閘北</p>
<p>（本報特訊）昨日上午十時許、敵機三架、先飛往閘北我軍陣地偵察、約一刻鐘之久、未幾、又來敵機五架、在二千尺至二千五百尺之高空、飛成一圓形、然後投下數彈、我方毫無損失、同時我陣地高射砲齊飛、敵機立時飛遁虹口上中、至下午一時許、敵機數架又往閘北各地偵察、迄晚未息、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）敵機鑒於我南市方面空防、異常完密、隨時隨地、有遭我軍擊落之虞、故、昨日南市上空之敵機、已减至極少數、卽間有一二飛來、其飛度亦極高、隱蔽雲裏幾爲目力所不能見、</p>
<p>敵艦昨又砲轟浦東</p>
<p>昨日清晨、日旗艦出雲統率敵艦多艘、曾以密集之砲火、向我浦東方面轟擊、我××方面亦予還擊、砲聲甚巨、全市人民、均從睡夢中驚醒、旋稍止、迨九時起、砲聲又作、約一小時許始停、同時有敵機多架、在浦東上空盤旋偵察、</p>
<p>浦東虹口昨均大火</p>
<p>（本報特訊）昨日上午二時三十分、南市自十六舖至董家渡一段對江浦東方面沿江之日商日淸公司·東省鐵路碼頭·及三菱洋行等所有倉庫·堆棧·碼頭突然同時起火、烈熖飛騰、火光啣接、且延燒甚速、結果全部付諸一炬、直至昨日下午三時、餘爐尙未全滅、損失不可勝計、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）虹口各區之大火、延燒亘三晝夜、雖曾一度稍殺、但今晨火勢又高、餘火復熾、據各方報告、中路之火、正在南洋烟公司附近之華式民房燃燒、東區方面、楊樹浦路之平和洋行堆棧之東、亦已着火、北面之火、則在虹口捕房附近及嘉興路、以及租界之邊境等處、</p>
<p>敵軍在虹口一帶縱火、阻我軍前進、延燒塘山路·百老汇路·吳淞路·海寗路等處、數千民屋、盡成焦土、幸我軍設法撲救、昨晨已大部熄滅、惟沈家灣一處、尙在延燒、而漢璧禮路·元芳路等處則又死灰復燃、焚燒甚烈、又有燎原之勢、</p>
<h3>本報記者今晨親至前綫視察</h3>
<p>王敬久師長有懇切談話　最短時間內可殲滅敵軍</p>
<p>（本報特訊）昨晚十二時許、本報記者驅車赴吳淞前綫視察、沿途路綫紆𢌞、疊經盤查、嗣經過眞茹大場、到達某地、時已今晨二時、訪晤前進攻匯山碼頭之師長王敬久氏、據談、獅子林·川沙口·一帶偷渡上岸之敵軍約計一師團、因中途遭我轟擊、內有一部卽中途敗退、其餘殘部、勉强掙扎、今晨我軍劇烈攻擊、預料於最短時間內、必可全數殲滅、截至今晨五時止、砲聲未絕、張華浜與蕰藻浜前夜上岸敵軍約二千人已完全被我軍擊退、至於楊樹浦虹口一帶、我軍嚴守所得優勢陣地、仍伺機向敵進攻中、王氏精神煥發、談吐精警、臨別並爲本報題“抗戰到底”四字、以爲紀念、將於今日本報夕刊中製版刊布、</p>
<h3>南京路墮彈確係日飛機炸彈</h3>
<p>發現彈頭開關上有一“安”字　與虹橋日軍官所遺手槍相同</p>
<p>前日先施公司之墮彈慘劇、死傷纍纍、現此項流彈、經各方面之研究、已證明爲飛機炸彈、而非砲彈、因當時尙有一彈落於四川路海彌爾登大廈後面之美國海軍堆棧、幸未炸裂、先施之炸彈、與海軍堆棧者、經研究結果、互相彷彿、惟略短而已、彈底直徑、約十八英吋、高約四英呎、重量約計須一千磅、故砲彈之說、已屬不可能同時英美槍砲專家、將堆棧未炸之彈、縝密研究之結果、已一致認爲空中炸彈、毫無疑義、且未炸之彈、尙有似中文而實非中文之字數字、彈上有黃綫三條、肇事之時、租界及浦東方面、毫無我空軍活動、而其時則一致目擊有日機數架、正在公共租界上察迴旋、至於此未炸之彈、由美海軍保管</p>
<p>發現重要證據</p>
<p>中央社云、前午有炸彈一枚、墮落於先施公司、炸死者達一百七十餘人、茲悉此炸彈之頭、業經尋獲、檢視之下、發現彈頭開關之上、有一“安”字、前者虹橋事件發生之時、曾檢獲日軍官所遺之手槍一枝、該槍開關之上、亦有一“安”字、由此足以證明前日先施公司炸彈、確係日機所墮、　　交通昨日恢復</p>
<p>南京路浙江路口昨日發生慘劇後、經公共租界警捕英軍、萬國商團、救火會及救護隊童子軍等之迅速救護、前晚已全部收拾淸楚、路面亦經修復、今晨五時起、交通已完全恢復、電車公共汽車、俱已開行、惟因炸毀房屋上、尙有碎片碎石落下、故出事地點兩旁之行人道、用阻礙物攔斷、禁止行人通行、先施永安營業、完全停止、左近新新大新、則照常開門、先施永安炸碎玻窗、俱加釘木板、先施永安內部、聞損失奇重、三樓東亞酒樓、全部毀壞、彈穿至二樓、故一樓亦損失不小、底層亦遭震毀、永安之損失、當時除舖內顧客及職員死傷外、自底層至四樓、震毀甚烈、</p>
<p>西人方面觀察</p>

<h3>上海中立區問題</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>上海局勢惡化後。日本帝國主義卽利用公共租界為軍事根據地。向我市區的武裝隊伍進攻。我軍爲保衛國士起見。自不能不卽起應戰。同時租界的中立地位。已為日本的軍事行動所破壞。因此我們為着戰略關係。不得不進而擊破日軍的根據地。由此而發生的損失。當然全由日本帝國主義負責。這在有利害關係的英美二國亦當明白諒解不過英國在滬有二萬五千萬鎊的投資。爲着保護這巨大利益起見。自然不願上海戰事繼續擴展。因於日前曾向中日二方建議在上海設立中立區。內容約分二點。㊀中日雙方軍隊退出上海四週地帶。㊁由英美法等國向日本担保僑民的安全向中國担保日本不利用租界爲軍事根據地。這個建議提出後。中日雙方尚未正式答復。據半官消息。日本業已决定拒絕我國方面則云可在原則上接受。此事以後如何發展現在尚不可知。</p>
<p>上海中立區的提出。就英國方面說為着保護他們的巨額投資利益起見自很切需。不過就我們方面說。應當堅守二點重要的立塲。</p>
<p>第一。上海戰時的發生。本由於日帝國主義的挑戰與侵略我國領土而起。我們祇不過是為自衛而起應戰。因此只要日本軍隊能退出吳淞口。不以租界爲軍事根據地上海的戰事就可結束。所謂設立中立區的提議根本無此需要。同時公共租界的本身本為一中立區域。主權仍屬中國。只要租界局能夠切實維持這中立地位。上海的戰事亦不至於擴大。及有關各國過去旣不能維持這種中立地位阻止日本利用租界為軍事根據地。而現在又倒果為因。建議設立中立區將上海市區亦劃入在內。這是我們所不能不愼重考慮的。</p>
<p>其次上海的戰事本是我國對日本帝國主義侵略之全面抗戰的一部。在日本的侵略沒有終止以前我們决不能局部休戰。假如上海可因租界與私人利益關係而設立中立區那末天津廣州漢口等地也可照樣設立中立區。這樣不但妨碍我們全面抗戰局勢的展開。損害我國領土主權的完整。而且還有利於敵人的進攻。這是我們所應愼重考慮的一點。</p>
<p>總之我們對於各友邦的中立區建設。固應予以善意考慮。但對於我們領土主權的完整與全面抗戰的局勢尤應嚴密顧到。</p>

<p>依據國際條約和解爭端　美對和平政策願使生效</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國防部長赫爾今日竭力呼籲世界和平、大致係對中日二國而發、赫氏並重提彼於七月十六日所聲明之美國外交政策、謂該項政策已有五十餘國正式承認爲國際關係之原則、中日兩國亦已表示贊同、此外尚有種種國際條約、如凱洛非戰公約及華府九國公約等、所包含之原則、莫不相同、中日兩國均經簽字、現在美國政府仍堅信此等原則應為國際關係之基礎、且應在全世界普遍實施、太平洋一帶亦不宜除外云此語顯係針對日本所提出之保留而作、同時赫氏並鄭重聲明、美國政府仍擬努力維持遠東和平、並保護該處之僑民、政府為此已調遣少數海軍陸戰隊開往上海、美國軍隊並無侵略之意、惟欲恊助維持當地之治安云、參院外交委員會主席華德門今晚作廣播演說、對於羅斯福總統不願草率實施中立法一事、為之辯護甚力、（廿三日國民電）</p>

<h3>上海撒兵建議</h3>
<p>我國復英聲明接受　日本狡猾英人失望</p>
<p>［倫敦］中國頃已通知英國、準備在原則上接受英國建議、中日軍隊及軍艦共同自上海區域撤退日本復文尚未送到、但英政府對於東京之消極態度、咸極失望、倫敦方面之日人均信、日本援軍已開到上海、戰勝之期當不在遠、故以為華軍若被日軍驅逐、則中立區之需要自即消滅再則、法國雖已同意英國之建議、但美國則覺此種建議之是否有效、尚須視日本之就範與否、以現狀觀之、則殊難成事實也、故中國之同意、除將一切拒絕之責任推諸日本之身外、他無實效云、（中央社二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］首相張伯倫·外相艾登·暨其地主要閣員數人、將於明後日舉行會議、討論上海戰事、據英國外交界人士聲稱、英國政策乃係保護上海公共租界以及英國在共他受戰事威脅各處利益為限、此項政策不致有所變更、大約各閣員將决定增加上海英國駐軍員額、但日本政府對於英國建議、若能提出折衷方案、俾西方各國對於上海僑民之安全及在該處利益、不復有所憂盧、則英國或不致續派軍隊前往上海云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］外相艾登現在漢浦郡海濱休憇、下星期中曾返倫敦一次、本星期亦將如此、外相今日下午將至外交部與掌璽大臣哈立法克斯勳爵、乘首相星期三日暫返倫敦之機、向之報告外交現局、而尤注重遠東地位、並與討論有關係之事件、英政府所提出上海中立建議、現仍未接中日兩政府之覆文、東京半官界對此建議似不同情、故此間頗為失望、南京雖未正式答覆但聞有贊同之傾響、英人對此、殊為滿意、上海英國當局現正竭力保護英僑、但租界四週之戰事、長此進行不能保不發生意外死傷、故特將婦孺暫遷他處、以免受有種種不便、實文告、聲明英政府决議取各種計畫保衛公共租界英僑生命財產、而使得臻安全也、據海軍部宣稱、中國英艦現分佈於下列各點、上海有巡洋艦與護送艦各一艘、吳淞有驅逐艦·旗艦·與護送艦各一艘、普渡島有巡洋艦兩艘、驅逐艦一艘、靑島有飛機母艦與驅逐艦各一艘威海衛有潛艇給養艦·埋雷艦·驅逐艦·護送艦各一艘、烟台有驅逐艦一艘、秦皇島有驅逐艦一艘、大沽有護送艦一艘、南京有巡洋艦一艘、（中央社二十四日路透電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］此間外交界人士對於外傳美國駐英大使平漢遄返華盛頓、係與英國所提在上海組織美法聯合陣綫之提議有英關之說、極為注意、雖此項傳說截至現時尚未證實、但英國頗有提出此議之可能、惟美方是作之意向、美國對英國所提在上海設立中立區之意見、雖表贊助、但申明此乃純粹消極辦法、美政府並未考慮及任何積極辦法云、（二十三日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］關於中日兩國戰事、美政府現所注意之唯一問題厥為上海與中國其他各他美國僑民之保護問題、羅斯福總統·赫爾國務卿·暨總統各重要顧問、連海陸軍高級將官在內、上星期六日所由均未離開華府者乃欲注視遠東時局之發展、局勢嚴重於此可見一斑、關於保僑一事、國務院原已訓令中國各地美國領事、堅勸本國僑民、務宜儘速離開戰區、但各該僑民、一則曾以巨額資金投放中國、不甘放棄再則自信係在領事裁判㯫保護之下、不慮有他、欲令彼等撤退、頗非易易、此外、關於美國實施中立法一事、消息靈通人士以為、此舉僅於日本有利、羅斯福總統爰决定儘量予以延綏、但若日本大舉進攻中國、則羅斯福總統自當實施之後、未必盡於日本有利、緣該國屆時必須以現金向美國購買貨物、并用本國船舶前來載運、此為日本着想、殊為不便也、美國當局曾經考慮禁止某某數種原料品、如　鐵·銅·煤油等物、輸往中日兩國、特以為此舉若果見諸實施、日本實必立即加以反對耳（中央社二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>中日戰爭勢必持久</h3>

<p>誘敵深入集中火力掃射　敵軍猝不及防傷亡逾千</p>
<p>確息、昨日上午六時餘有敵艦十餘艘、隨帶小艇數十艘、開抵南匯海灘洋面、卽以排砲、集中火力、向我岸上陣地、猛烈轟擊、移時、遂以小艇滿載步兵約一千二百餘人、携帶輕機關槍等軍器、迅速駛近灘岸，潮湧上陸、我守軍當時佯示力薄、僅以少數部隊與敵周旋、敵覃遂乘勢深入、我大部守軍、俟敵立足未穩之際、以機關槍集中火力、向敵軍密結隊掃射、同時復以砲火脅迫敵軍後路、敵狼狽萬狀、我軍伺機衝鋒肉搏、敵衆披靡、傷亡累累、是役敵軍生還者、僅有百餘名、我軍□□師、稍受損傷、</p>
<p>另據續訊、南匯方面敵軍殘部約一百數十人、仍在我軍三面包圍截擊中、因該處沙灘甚闊歸路被我火力壓斷之故、</p>
<h3>吳淞沿岸已無敵踪</h3>

<h3>敵艦兩艘中彈神下沉</h3>
<p>沿江沿海我軍實力雄厚　敵軍决不能越雷池一步</p>
<p>據頃由前綫返滬者報告、昨日下午五時、我軍砲隊、以重砲密集向吳淞口外掩護敵軍登陸之敵艦猛擊、敵維兩艘擊中下沉、</p>
<p>確訊、昨日外傳口外登陸之敵軍、已突破我軍之陣綫、並巳深入某某地帶、完全為無稽之謠言、頃據軍界可靠特訊、我方在沿江沿海各處口岸、配備兵力、非常雄厚、最近又復在各該處要點、增援部隊、達口師以上、敵軍雖欲拚死打開血路、亦絕對不能越雷池一步、</p>
<p>中央社、今晨（二十五日）零時五分一時三十分左右、我空軍又曾數度出動於浦江及吳淞口上空、轟炸敵艦、時月光皎潔、萬里無雲、但聞機聲軋軋、不絕於耳、淞口及浦面之敵艦、遂紛以探海燈職射、並亂放高射砲、卒因找駕駛員膽大心細、技術神妙、依然在敵艦叢中、活躍異常、當時曾投下數彈、並開放機關槍掃射、據昨日抵淞口之加拿大皇后號輪乘客西人多人、於今日上午抵滬談、渠等目賭停泊淞口外之砲艦一艘被我擊沉、驅逐艦一艘被我擊中尾部、受傷甚重、</p>

<h3>敵圖轉移戰局不果</h3>
<p>增援三師團冀解虹口之圍　我迎頭痛聲登岸企圖失敗</p>
<p>敵軍在場樹浦虹口方面、已陷勢窮力蹙之境、覆滅之期、必不在遠、敵在此綫戰事、自始卽處被動地位、受制於我優勢之兵力、無法轉移戰局、現敵欲解除上海戰局之危機、以期以速戰速决之手段、使我軍敗衂、故增援三師團來滬、欲以優勢兵力登陸、牽制戰局、並轉捩其悲慘之地位、連日在我長江下游各口及南匯沿海各處企圖登陸、均被我軍擊退、損傷極大、預料敵軍受此重創後、短期內不敢再犯、</p>

<p>敵機在我東西各區投彈　但均在田野間無甚損害</p>
<p>我空軍於昨夜同敵軍陣地及敵艦作三次夜襲後、據今晨探悉、在淞口一帶敵軍觔既．曾受重創、同時托北四川路蓬絡間之確軍細萬、亦曾波妝審軍擲中曰彈、立郎爆炸、敵軍傷亡甚衆我機均於敵軍密集之高射砲彈中、安然而返、</p>
<p>敵軍自受此重創後、該敵艦上水上轟炸機十餘架、亟於今晨五時許飛起、分回東西區各地偵察、並在××等處投彈、不下二十餘枚、今晨黎明時之巨嚮、亦係日機投彈時所致、惟我方一無損失、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>二十四日倫敦電。中國頃已通知英國。準備在原則上接受英國建議。中日軍隊及軍艦。共同自上海區域撤退。日本復文。尚未送到。英政府頗感失望。日本係侵略者的國家。我國係被侵略的國家。我國誠極願希望和平。然在此‘共同撤退’之原則下。或可接受。否則惟有‘抗敵到底’四字奉告。以待日本自行悔悟而已。</p>
<p>日本時報宣稱。戰事至少當延長至一年之久。然陸相杉山。則謂日本當在軍事上迅運獲得勝利。决不使曠日持久。故將改採攻勢。此語誠為奇特。試問自蘆案發生以來。日本軍事上何時何地曾取守勢乎。我國軍隊。則處處惟取守勢。靜待一年或兩年之後再來說話。</p>

<h3>平漢前綫（三）</h3>
<p>— 西民</p>
<p>在前綫使我感觸最深的莫過於兩件事，第一是北方一般民氣的消沉和民衆組織之鬆懈，第二是漢奸活動的特別猖獗。中國本來就是一盤散沙的民族，近年來因為國難嚴重，中國中南部各省在政府注意之下訓練了許多壯丁隊等，總算略見成績。但在河北省政治措施上，過去處處與中央政府有些相違，因此對於國民中佔絕對多數的農民從來就忽略了他們的訓練和訓練工作。農民們知識係陋民族國家意識，因為缺乏訓練和實際的認識，簡直是無從充實和發展。這一種缺點，在今日需中國全民族社員抗戰的時候，特別嚴重！德國名將魯登道夫曾說，全民族精神統一是戰爭勝利的基本條件，這眞是千古不磨的定論。可是在德國。牠的戰爭上的是向外發展，侵略的小民族和國家。這一戰爭只是為德國和緩的金融寫明獲取原因和製成品的市塲，所以戰爭的利益，不在大多數中國人民而在少數上層階級。因爲如此，所以德國的野心軍人爲了號召全國民衆起來，爲少數資產階級擲頭數抛熱血，以爭奪市塲，就只得創造一種虛僞的什麼日爾曼民族是天生最優秀民族等理論，一方面積極排斥猶太人，認爲共產主義與宗敎，都是猶太人的陰謀，以這種種牽强附會的方法來統一民族精神，雖然我們不得不嘆贊軍人陰謀家用心之苦，但是結果民衆必然會從事實上認識種種理論的虛偽性．東方唯一强盗的日本，現在發動全國民衆來侵略中國，他們法西軍人的中號與目的，性質上是跟西方的德國絕對相同的，因此他們的結果也同樣是一般無二。侵略國家的軍人雖然道出了全民族精神統一的重要，但是現在的社會虛構終會使他們的努力歸於泡影。</p>
<p>然而在找們中國就全然不同了。中國是在日本帝國主義壓迫下的一個民族，全民族都一致要求打倒侵略他們領土主權的敵人和爭取國家的自由獨立。所以只要抗敵戰爭一爆發，全民族都會精誠地團結一致。我們的民族精神統一，不需要像魯登道夫那樣去創造違反眞理的理論，但是北方民氣却出人意外的消沈，幾乎使我們不可解釋，而因民氣消沈組織䯳懈，對全民抗敵的偉大戰鬥力量的樹立，不待說是一大缺陷。因此民衆的組織和訓練工作，在前方是特別于需要了。我們爲了求得抗戰的最後勝利，怎樣去組織民衆訓練民衆，使民衆的力量與軍隊弟兄的戰鬥有機的聯系起來，該是今日最迫切的任務．記者在前綫晤及某師敎調處長文國琳先生，他很懇摯的與我談組織前方民衆的各種困難，和軍隊裏政訓工作的不易開展。我仔細地考慮了這個問題，覺得今後的民衆組織和訓練工作，必須軍隊政府和民衆團體方面密切合作之下，才能獲得成効。</p>
<p>在前綫我們聽到好些極嚴重的傳說，有少數縣份的地方行政長官，會在敵人蹝踪絕未發現前，而棄城潛逃，這樣的行政長官，怎樣配去領導民衆調練民衆。所以在此地便我想起後方的救國團體應該努力培植深入民間的工作人員。</p>
<p>其次關於漢奸問題，在前方不時可以捕獲漢奸份子，這些被逮捕的漢奸中，十之八九皆爲生活無法解决，以極低廉的代價，供敵人驅使的可憐虫。他們的技術非常低劣，記者有一晚宿前綫某司令等，車站方面促來一個漢奸，問他你在什麼地方做事，他說是在二十九軍三十七師當弟兄的，問他三十七師師長是誰，他却瞠目不知所對。這樣的漢奸，敵人驅使他們不在探聽軍情．主要的是在破壞交通等等，爲了幾塊錢忘掉祖國去爲敵人拚命，想起來眞是可痛而又可憐。</p>
<p>記者早就認定，對付這些漢奸的辦法，最根本的是加緊組織民衆和調練民衆，提高人民愛國抗敵的熱情，這樣，民衆便可以直接肅淸當地的漢奸，使漢奸無法活動。同時目前軍隊對漢奸的注意的確是極認眞的，但是也有缺點，因爲我覺得無論是政府軍隊或民衆團體，對於撲滅漢奸組織，應該有負專責的組織來辦理，這才能有系統的調査和破獲。我們對捕獲的漢奸，不僅是處以極刑，最要緊的是應該用各種方法，使他供出羽黨，以便一網打盡。這决不是普通軍隊裏的長官或弟兄所管得了的。記者到各處考察的結果，有許多漢奸自逮捕後，即東移西遷，引渡到第二第三機關審問定讞，時間五拖長，就可以使那漢奸羽黨有所凖備，捕捉自然困難得多。我很希望政府的特務機團，在此時應該全體到抗戰前綫去專門做撲滅漢奸的工作，後方的民衆團體也應該加倍努力於剷除漢奸的宣傳和行動。</p>
<p>記者在前方觀察的結果對於我國抗戰的最後勝利問題，我不關心我國軍隊的戰鬥能力的强弱，最迫切的倒是注目於今後民衆與軍隊怎樣打成一片的問題，僅以此語作本文結束，希望大家注意這個問題。</p>

<h3>難民產婦醫院訪問記</h3>
<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>雙胞胎六個月流産，産婦生命危險　經費不甚充足，希望各界熱心捐助</p>
<p>（本報特寫）月從滬戰發生以後，戰區內的同胞，都擁擠到租界里來，甚至還有從上海四鄕來的。他們都留得條性命，他們的財產，現在或許已經犧牲在猛烈的砲火之下了，這無數萬流連失所的難民，是誰讓他們遭遇到這種悲慘的局面，這是我們應該認淸楚的。我們的生命財產都可以犧牲，但對蹟武國家的野心侵略者非給予迎頭痛擊不可。記者曾經到過幾個難民收容所他們雖然感到妻離子散，家破人亡的悲哀，但是他們是如何逼切地盼望着“最後的勝利”而且他們相信“最後的勝利”是屬於我們的。</p>
<p>現在，據統計：上海約有十二萬難民二百餘處收容所。所里每天供給二粥一飯，生活自然右以不生問題，但是有許多臨𣄀的難婦，是應該及早預爲她們設想的，於是有惠生及人和兩醫院的張麗玲，盛名綺，嚴用江，郭惠楨，陸鳴玉，張必如等六位產科女醫師，及王岳峯先生組織了一個“上海市難縱產婦醫院”，院址暫借戈登路一○八五號生活幼稚園。記者今日早上特地去訪問了一次。</p>
<p>送進了名片之後，就再盛文綺醫師很殷勤地招待到各處去參觀。首先到臨產室，那里居中放着一張臨產床，靠壁是兩個櫥，裏面都是手術器械及各種藥水。因爲是學校讓出一部份來佈置的，設備方面當然選稍稍簡陋點、但對於產婦，這是多麼偉大的人類互助精神底表現。</p>
<p>病房是三間敎室，現在共有八十個舖位、需要時可以增加到一百個。接生就由上面的六位醫師擔任，主任醫師是張麗玲小姐。她是去年正月到日本大阪赤上字社病院去攻習，因爲此次上海戰事發生，特地歸國來創設這個“難民產婦醫院”的，看護共有九位，有三位因為昨天輪着晚班，就在病房裏安睡，這種服務精神，值得嘉許！</p>
<p>現在院裏有二位產婦。一位是由貝勒路南洋無綫電傳習所（現在也收容難民）送來的，或許是避難的時候，胎兒受了損傷，昨天晚上流產了，胎兒祇有四個月，這無辜的小生命是受誰之賜呢？我不禁要問。所幸產婦安全。</p>
<p>還有一位，是由大世界收容所送來的，也是因爲墮彈那天受了傷，六個月流產了，而且還是雙胞胎。盛醫師也曾引導我參觀這一對同命嬰孩。他們像一對小貓一樣安放在一個瓷盆裏，靜靜地閉着眼，他們沒有看到蹟武國家的慘酷行為，這是幸，還是不幸呢？產婦因爲流產的時候，胞衣久久不上，以致流血過多，而且那天又是颱風過滬，或許還受了點凉，現在變成“產熱症，”至今沒有脫離危險期。記者到病房裏去的時候，正見她對我們注視着，她面色像蠟紙一樣蒼白，聲吸也有些急促。本來想詢問她避難的情形及流產的經過．但看到這樣慘凉的情况，還能忍心去無她開口嗎？她或許正在惦念她的存亡莫卜的丈夫，和兩個可愛的子女，這眞是極人　的悲痛了！</p>
<p>盛醫師最後吿訴我，這“難民產婦醫院”因為是私人組織的，經費方面不很充足，這是希望各界熱心捐助。這不但是惠及產婦，同時也是後方很重要的工作。</p>
<p>還有一點要聲明的，這醫院接收的產婦，是要從各難民收容所送來的，或者有相當證明書。就是打電話去，她們也同樣出診。電話是三七七六六號。</p>

<h3>Enemy's Rear Assault Plan Fails, Fierce and Bloody Battle Rages All Day in Lion Grove</h3>
<p>Battles Still Unstoppable as of 5 AM This Morning. Enemies Who Slipped into Luodian Have Been Completely Annihilated. Enemy Troops in Zhanghuabang and Other Areas Have Been Completely Swept Away.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) In the past two days, the center of the war has shifted to the Wusong coast. Two divisions of enemy reinforcements, having spied for many days, took the opportunity to sneak across and attack our army's rear. Fortunately, our army was well prepared. For days, enemy troops landing at Zhanghuabang, Yunzaobang, Wusong Paotaiwan (Fort Taiwan), Lion Grove, and other coastal areas have been bravely repelled head-on by our army. Scattered remnants of the enemy are now concentrated in Lion Grove, putting up a desperate resistance. Another group of approximately one thousand men infiltrated Luodian Township by a roundabout route. After being heavily surrounded by our army and engaged in fierce fighting for half a day, they were completely annihilated. On the Lion Grove front, the most intense bloody battle began yesterday afternoon. Both sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat, with enemy corpses scattered across the field. As of 5 AM this morning, the fighting had not stopped. According to a certain military expert, based on a comparison of the military strength of both sides and the geographical situation, the complete elimination of the enemy at Lion Grove is only a matter of time. It will not cause any military hindrance to our side and is therefore not a cause for concern.</p>
<p>From the 22nd to the morning of the 23rd, enemy troops launched sneak attacks on Wusong, Zhanghuabang, Yunzaobang, Liuhe, Yanglinkou and other places, attempting to land. Our army bravely countered, and the fighting was exceptionally fierce. The enemy was ultimately unable to withstand the attacks and retreated in a disarray. However, the enemy's attempt to land was not extinguished. The enemy dispatched a brigade the night before last (23rd), under the heavy cover of dense enemy ships and artillery fire, fiercely attacking the Wusong Paotaiwan (Fort Taiwan) area. A small number of enemy troops also managed to sneak across and land. Our army calmly responded with dense machine-gun fire and heavy artillery counterattacks. Soon, our air force arrived to assist in the battle, launching fierce bombings. The enemy troops, caught in a pincer attack by our land and air forces, suffered heavy casualties. After a bloody battle until approximately 3 AM yesterday morning, our army finally inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy, completely thwarting their attempt to land.</p>
<p>Further news: Yesterday (24th) morning, at approximately 4 AM, as dawn was breaking, another approximately 3,000 enemy troops approached the border, swarming ashore in the area from east of Paotaiwan (Fort Taiwan) Foreign Wharf along the embankment to Shigeng. This area, a wide sandy beach, a former seawater bathing area, was easily accessible. At the time, our army remained completely still, waiting until all the enemy troops had landed before launching an ambush and encirclement. They used machine guns to bravely sweep the area, taking a three-pronged attack, engaging in fierce fighting for over three hours. The enemy troops suffered heavy casualties, with most either killed or wounded, and began to retreat in disarray towards the beach, hastily jumping onto motorboats and fleeing towards Sanxia Water. Our army seized a significant amount of enemy equipment. There are still many enemy ships on the sea off Lion Grove and Bailongjiang River facing Wusong, constantly attempting to land. Therefore, our army has deployed heavy troops to guard each of these locations. Yesterday, in addition to firing to cover the landing of troops, there was little other artillery combat time from enemy ships. The sound of artillery fire was sparse in the afternoon because the enemy troops were intimidated and did not dare to launch sneak attacks during the day. Furthermore, our coastal positions are solid, making it difficult for enemy ships to succeed.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Yesterday afternoon, a certain shipping company in this port received a telegram from a foreign ship blocked in Litongsha, stating that the intensity of the Wusong battle yesterday, the fierceness of the artillery fire, and the bravery of the Chinese army in repelling the enemy were indescribable. At the height of the battle at noon, a squadron of Chinese air force flew to the Wusong sea area, risking danger to drop bombs and bombarding a Japanese transport ship fully loaded with reinforcements. This led to an air battle, with machine-gun bullets flying wildly in the air and occasionally landing near the ship. The sound of gunfire at Wusongkou subsided slightly at 4 PM. The Jardine Matheson's Shinfuku Maru was the first to venture in, finally arriving at the Kin Lee Yuen Wharf at night. Ningxing and New Beijing have not been able to come in yet, and have to come to Shanghai at 8 o'clock this morning, because the Public Concession and the Japanese Naval Commander stationed in Shanghai have agreed that all refugee ships flying foreign flags can pass through Wusong at 8 am and 3 pm every day. If there is fierce battle (such as yesterday), even if there are regulations, they cannot enter or leave.</p>
<p>Enemy Landing Troops Suffer Heavy Blows</p>
<p>Reliable news: The day before yesterday (23rd) morning, at approximately 4 AM, the enemy, with a brigade of troops under the intense artillery cover of a large number of warships, once again attacked us along the coast of the Baoshan Chuansha River Estuary. Our defending troops fought valiantly to defend their positions, holding on for dear life until approximately 6 AM. Eventually, a portion of the enemy troops took the opportunity to land, launching fierce attacks on our positions. Enemy traces were found along the coast from the Lion Grove Fort to the Chuansha River Estuary. While the enemy engaged us in intense fighting, they sent a small detachment of approximately six or seven hundred men, sneaking from Chuansha Township through Mujiao Bridge to Luodian Township. Our Luodian defending troops, upon receiving the urgent report from the front lines, had already arrived at the line between Shengjiaju and Yuepu Township. Our main force, which was controlling the ×× area, had not yet arrived at Luodian Township. There were only a very small number of garrison troops stationed there, and they were unable to resist effectively. The enemy troops then occupied the township and constructed fortifications nearby to prevent our reinforcements from advancing. At approximately 2 PM, our reinforcements arrived at the front lines along the Jialuo Road and the Huta Road, immediately surrounding and fiercely attacking the enemy at Luodian. At this time, the enemy's heavy weapons had not yet been fully deployed. After our army launched a fierce attack, the enemy struggled for approximately an hour before collapsing completely. They set fire to houses, covering their retreat, and immediately retreated along the original route. Our army tracked and pursued them to the vicinity of Chuansha Township. The enemy resisted by relying on the river. Both sides engaged in fierce fighting across the river. Our army encircled the enemy from the right flank, causing the entire line to collapse. At approximately 4 PM, our army annihilated all of the enemy troops, capturing a large number of enemy maps and weapons. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, with bodies littering the area. After our army cleared the enemy from this line, they immediately moved eastward along the river, advancing to the front of Shengjia Bridge. Our army was still engaged in fierce fighting with the landing enemy. We used an overwhelming force to launch a fierce attack on the enemy's flank, causing them to collapse in disarray. As of yesterday (24th) at 3 PM, our army was still encircling and annihilating the enemy at the old site of the Lion Grove Fort.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Who Slipped into Luodian Completely Annihilated by Us</h3>
<p>Over Two Hundred People All Eliminated. Enemy Planes Fly to Drop Bombs, Causing Fire.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: The day before yesterday (23rd) at noon, a large number of enemy troops suddenly appeared in Shidong, near the Lion Grove in Baoshan County, and with the cover of heavy artillery and aircraft, sneakily landed. Our army immediately fought valiantly to meet them, but because the enemy's artillery fire was dense, more than two hundred enemy troops broke through and slipped into Luodian Town near Shidong. Soon after, our rear troops reinforced the troops from □□□□, and attacked the enemy troops who entered Luodian. By 1:00 a.m. yesterday (24th), the enemy who had entered Luodian had been completely annihilated, and our army immediately advanced to Shidong, and eliminated the enemies there.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Luodian Town, Baoshan County, used to be a very prosperous commercial center and the best in the entire county. But the day before yesterday (23rd) at about 7:00 a.m., six enemy aircraft flew to drop sulfur bombs, and a big fire broke out in the town. After all the firefighters were dispatched to rescue, the enemy planes used machine guns to arbitrarily strafe our firefighters, and seven people were injured or killed on the spot, causing the fire to spread and all the bustling areas of the town were turned to ashes. Yesterday morning at about 10:00 a.m., several enemy planes flew to drop bombs, but none of them hit, so there was not much loss. The Shanghai Fellow Association of the county is now actively trying to rescue the refugees of the county from danger. There were also enemy planes flying to bomb the inside and outside of the Jiading County the day before yesterday, with as many as sixty bombs dropped, but fortunately our side was prepared, so there was no loss.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops at Zhanghuabang Completely Repulsed</p>
<p>According to official news, at about 12:00 noon on the 23rd, six to seven hundred enemy troops sneaked across and landed at Zhanghuabang, but were bravely repulsed by our army with dense machine guns and fierce artillery fire. Another group of approximately one brigade of enemy troops sneakily landed between Baoshan and Chuanshakou (ie Shidong), and have been surrounded by our army, and the battle is very fierce. At that time, a small number of enemies reached Luodian at about 2:00 p.m. on the 23rd, and they were also surrounded by our army and completely annihilated, and many maps and weapons were seized.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Carrier Arrives at Chuansha</p>
<p>According to reliable news, an enemy aircraft carrier arrived at the sea off Xujia Town, north of Chuansha County, with the purpose of protecting the enemy troops at any time and sneaking across the coast to land, but our army's defenses are so solid that the enemy will never succeed.</p>
<p>Our Army's Central Route Thrusts Westward</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After the enemy reinforcements sneaked ashore the night before last, the center of the war in this port has shifted from Hongkou to Wusong. Therefore, the Hongkou front was quieter yesterday morning. There was no fierce contact on the line of Yuanfang Road and Zhaoshu Road. In the north, there was sporadic artillery fire in the Qujiang Road area. On the left and right sides of Hushan Road and Huade Road, there were still stalemated street battles. Since arriving in the Hushan Wharf area, our army's central route has been bravely thrusting westward for days. One part has arrived at Wuzhou Road, and has now advanced to North New Hongqiao, connecting with our army in the Disiwei Road area. Another part has arrived at East and West Huade Road, and has also advanced to the Hongqiao River. The enemy troops retreated to the Bailao Road area west of the Outer Hongqiao, making a final struggle.</p>
<p>The hundred or so remnant enemies who occupied the Gongdong Iron Factory were completely annihilated by our army the day before yesterday. Currently, Baoding Road, Huade Road, Jingzhou Road, and Tangshan Road are all in the hands of our army, and there are no traces of the enemy. The enemy troops set fire to the houses from Tangshan Road to Kunming Road when they retreated, and almost all of them were turned to ashes.</p>
<p>The official news about the battle in the eastern district of Hongkou last night is as follows: ㊀ The enemy troops set fire to the houses from Tangshan Road to Kunming Road when they retreated, and almost all of them were turned to ashes; ㊁ Tangshan Road area is now entirely in the hands of our army; ㊂ The hundred or so remnant enemies in the Japanese Gokin Iron Factory were completely annihilated by our army in the past two days. Currently, there are no traces of the enemy in the Baoding Road, Huade Road, and Jingzhou Road areas. ㊃ The wharves along the Yangshupu and the along-river areas, which are still in the hands of the enemy, have been severely damaged by our artillery fire. The remnant enemies suffered heavy losses and did not dare to enter the wharves. They are now stepping up the construction of new fortifications near the wharves, hoping to defend them to the death, but their morale is extremely panicked. Regarding the Hongkou area, the remnant enemies trapped in Hongkou Park, because they have fallen into a heavy encirclement and are facing a desperate situation, have launched three consecutive attacks on our lines since the evening of the 23rd, hoping to break through, but were all repulsed by our army. The enemy suffered approximately two hundred casualties.</p>
<p>Our Air Force Launches Three Night Raids</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At 9:20 last night, our air force suddenly appeared in the moonlight, in the dim of night, over the enemy ships in the Huangpu River and the enemy positions in the Hongkou area. The enemy was caught off guard and panicked, and the meteor-style red and green illumination bombs and anti-aircraft guns were fired in a continuous stream, glittering with multicolored lights, creating a spectacular sight. But our air force did not care, and the sound of the planes became closer and closer. After about a quarter of an hour, the enemy's anti-aircraft guns became more and more dense, and at the same time, our planes responded with extremely fierce machine-gun fire. Suddenly, there was a thunderous sound, shaking far and wide, as our planes dropped huge bombs.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At 0:15 this morning, several of our air force planes launched a second night raid on the enemy ships in the Huangpu River. The enemy ships fired their anti-aircraft guns in unison, and our planes dropped five bombs in a row. One of the bombs made an unusually loud and crisp sound, presumably hitting an enemy ship. Our planes bombed for about half an hour before leisurely flying towards the Songkou area. Just as the enemy's terrified souls had settled down, hoping that our planes would not fly again before dawn today, unexpectedly, within half an hour, our air force launched a third surprise attack. At that time, the situation of the enemy's anti-aircraft guns firing wildly and aimlessly showed the enemy's panic and chaos. But this time, our planes only circled for about ten minutes and did not drop bombs, and still went to the northeast. In summary, our air force's three night raids are estimated to have cost the enemy at least a thousand anti-aircraft shells.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: After our planes flew to Songkou last night for a night raid on the enemy ships, they flew from Song to Shanghai at midnight. Amidst the dense firing of enemy ships, the planes calmly dropped many bombs, and then safely left Shanghai and returned.</p>
<p>Our Planes Shoot Down Two Enemy Planes</p>
<p>It is now known that at 9:00 a.m. the day before, when enemy planes attempted to land in the Wusong area and were severely attacked by our army, 27 of our planes flew to assist in the battle. In addition to dropping bombs on the enemy ships and causing them serious damage, they also shot down two enemy planes.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Reconnoiter Zhabei Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At approximately 10 AM yesterday morning, three enemy planes first flew to Zhabei to reconnoiter our army's positions for about a quarter of an hour. Shortly thereafter, five more enemy planes came, flying in a circle at an altitude of 2,000 to 2,500 feet, and then dropped several bombs. Our side suffered no losses. At the same time, our position's anti-aircraft guns fired in unison, and the enemy planes immediately fled into Hongkou. Until approximately 1 PM, several enemy planes came to reconnoiter various parts of Zhabei, and did not stop until evening.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy planes, in view of the fact that our air defenses in the Nanshi area are exceptionally complete, and that they are at risk of being shot down by our army at any time, have reduced the number of enemy planes over Nanshi to a very small number. Even when one or two fly over, they fly at extremely high altitudes, hiding in the clouds and almost invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Enemy Ships Bombard Pudong Again Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Japanese flagship Izumo, leading many enemy ships, used dense artillery fire to bombard our Pudong area. Our ×× area also returned fire, and the sound of artillery was very loud. The people of the city were all awakened from their sleep, and then stopped slightly. At about 9:00, the sound of artillery fire started again, and stopped after about an hour. At the same time, many enemy planes hovered and reconnoitered over Pudong.</p>
<p>Major Fires in Pudong and Hongkou Yesterday</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At 2:30 a.m. yesterday, the Japanese Nissin Company, the East China Railway Wharf, and the Mitsubishi Corporation, all located on the Pudong side of the river from the 16th Pier to Dongjiadu in Nanshi, suddenly caught fire simultaneously. The flames soared, and the firelight connected, and spread very quickly, resulting in all of them being turned to ashes. Until 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the embers had not been completely extinguished, and the losses were incalculable.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The major fire in various districts of Hongkou has been burning for three days and nights. Although it had been slightly extinguished once, the fire rose again this morning, and the embers reignited. According to reports from all sides, the fire in the middle route is burning in the Chinese-style civilian houses near the Nanyang Tobacco Company. On the eastern side, the east side of the pile of Pinghe Yangxing on Yangshupu Road has also caught fire. The fire on the north side is near the Hongkou Police Station and Jiaxing Road, and the border of the concession, etc.</p>
<p>The enemy troops set fires in the Hongkou area to block our army's advance, and spread to Tangshan Road, Broadway Road, Wusong Road, and Haining Road, etc., turning thousands of civilian houses into scorched earth. Fortunately, our army managed to put out the fire, and most of it was extinguished yesterday morning. However, one place in Shenjiawan is still burning, while Hanbili Road and Yuanfang Road, etc., have been rekindled and are burning fiercely, with the potential to spread further.</p>
<h3>Our Newspaper's Reporter Personally Inspected the Front Line This Morning</h3>
<p>Commander Wang Jingjiu Had a Sincere Conversation: The Enemy Troops Can Be Annihilated in the Shortest Possible Time</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At approximately 12:00 last night, the reporter of this newspaper drove to the Wusong front line to inspect. The route was winding and circuitous, and there were repeated inspections. After passing through Zhenru Dachang, the reporter arrived at a certain place at 2:00 a.m. this morning, and interviewed Commander Wang Jingjiu, who was attacking the Huishan Wharf. According to him, the enemy troops who sneaked ashore in the Lion Grove and Chuanshakou areas are estimated to be one division. Due to being bombarded by our army midway, one part of them retreated midway, and the remaining remnants barely struggled. This morning, our army launched a fierce attack, and it is expected that they will be completely annihilated in the shortest possible time. As of 5:00 a.m. this morning, the sound of artillery fire has not stopped. The approximately 2,000 enemy troops who landed in Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang the night before have been completely repulsed by our army. As for the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas, our army is strictly guarding the advantageous positions it has gained and is still waiting for an opportunity to attack the enemy.

<h3>The Bomb Dropped on Nanjing Road Was Indeed a Japanese Airplane Bomb</h3>
<p>A "安" (An) Character Was Found on the Fuse of the Bombhead, Which Is the Same As the One on the Pistol Left by the Japanese Officer in Hongqiao</p>
<p>The tragedy of the bomb dropped on the Sincere Company the day before yesterday, which resulted in numerous deaths and injuries, has now been proven by various parties to have been an airplane bomb, not an artillery shell. This is because another bomb fell behind the U.S. Navy depot behind the Sichuan Road and Hamirton Building, but it did not explode. The bomb at Sincere Company and the one at the Navy depot were studied, and the results were similar, but slightly shorter. The diameter of the bottom of the bomb is about 18 inches, and the height is about 4 feet, and the weight is about 1,000 pounds. Therefore, the theory of artillery shells is impossible. At the same time, British and American gun experts conducted a detailed study of the unexploded bomb in the depot, and unanimously agreed that it was undoubtedly an aerial bomb. And there are several characters that look like Chinese characters but are not actually Chinese on the unexploded bomb. There are three yellow lines on the bomb. At the time of the incident, there was no activity of our air force in the concession and Pudong areas, but at that time, it was unanimously witnessed that several Japanese planes were circling in the public concession. As for the unexploded bomb, it is kept by the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>Important Evidence Found</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that a bomb fell on the Sincere Company the day before noon, killing more than 170 people. It is now known that the head of the bomb has been found. After inspection, it was found that there was an "安" (An) character on the fuse of the bombhead. When the Hongqiao incident occurred earlier, a pistol left by a Japanese officer was seized, and there was also an "安" (An) character on the fuse of the gun. This is enough to prove that the bomb at the Sincere Company the day before yesterday was indeed dropped by a Japanese plane. Traffic Resumed Yesterday</p>
<p>After the tragedy at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road yesterday, the Public Concession police, British troops, the Volunteer Corps, the fire department, and the Boy Scout ambulance team quickly rescued and cleaned up the scene completely the night before. The road surface has also been repaired, and traffic has been fully restored since 5:00 this morning. Trams and buses have all resumed operation, but because there are still fragments and gravel falling from the destroyed buildings, the sidewalks on both sides of the scene of the accident are blocked off with obstacles to prohibit pedestrian traffic. Sincere and Wing On are completely closed, while the nearby New World and Great World are open as usual. The broken glass windows of Sincere and Wing On have been nailed with wooden boards. It is said that the internal losses of Sincere and Wing On were extremely heavy. The East Asia Restaurant on the third floor was completely destroyed, and the bomb penetrated to the second floor, so the first floor also suffered a lot of damage. The bottom floor was also shaken and destroyed. The losses of Wing On, in addition to the deaths and injuries of customers and employees in the store at the time, were severe from the bottom floor to the fourth floor.</p>
<p>Observations from Westerners</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News stated that the huge bomb that hit the building of Sincere Company has been determined to be a bomb, but it has been broken into pieces and is difficult to identify. However, the huge bomb that fell on the U.S. Navy depot at the same time is complete because it did not explode. It is believed to have been dropped by a plane flying at extremely high speed. According to foreign observers, when the tragedy occurred at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, three Japanese planes were seen flying over the Public Concession. A silver single-seat aircraft, which foreign observers called a "strange aircraft," was flying extremely high, and even with powerful telescopes, it was impossible to identify the symbols on the aircraft. The Public Concession is currently being investigated by Inspector Robertson of the Lao Zha Police Station. The British and American naval authorities are also conducting a separate, informal investigation for the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Death and Injury Toll Announced</p>
<p>The Public Concession announced the death and injury toll as follows: From 6:00 p.m. on August 23rd to 10:00 a.m. on August 24th, the latest statistics of the deaths and injuries in the Nanjing Road tragedy are as follows: 173 dead, 549 injured. Sincere, Wing On, and the surrounding buildings suffered heavy losses. The deaths and injuries of foreigners are as follows: Deaths: Mr. Brunner, Swiss, and Mr. Eggerd, German. Injured: Mr. Beringer, American, Ms. Sheamomey, Ms. Grant Chow, and Ms. Denai. The police deaths and injuries were one Indian police officer and two Chinese police officers. Seriously injured: one Indian patrol leader and four Chinese police officers. Slightly injured: one Chinese patrol officer, one Chinese patrol leader, and three Chinese police officers.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Continue to Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>From 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. yesterday, more than 400 foreigners continued to board small fireboats at the Jianghai Customs Wharf in four batches and sailed to Songkou, where they transferred to the German Postal Ship Company's Glouisenan to Hong Kong. Most of them were German nationals. In addition, a fourth group of about 100 American women and children from Shanghai boarded a small Dalat Company wheelhorse at the Customs Wharf at 1:00 p.m. yesterday and went to Songkou, where they transferred to the Pierce President to Manila. In total, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the total number of foreign nationals (excluding Japanese) who have left Shanghai is over 4,000.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Neutral Zone Issue</h3>
<p>— Supplement</p>
<p>After the Shanghai situation deteriorated, Japanese imperialism immediately used the Public Concession as a military base to attack our city's armed forces. For the sake of defending our territory, our army had no choice but to immediately fight back. At the same time, the neutral status of the Concession had already been undermined by Japan's military actions. Therefore, for strategic reasons, we had to advance and destroy the Japanese military base. The resulting losses will naturally be the full responsibility of Japanese imperialism. This is something that the two countries with vested interests, Britain and the United States, should understand and appreciate. However, Britain has an investment of 250 million pounds in Shanghai. In order to protect this huge interest, it is naturally unwilling to see the continuation of the war in Shanghai. Therefore, it recently suggested to both China and Japan that a neutral zone be established in Shanghai. The content is roughly divided into two points: ㊀ Both Chinese and Japanese troops withdraw from the area around Shanghai. ㊁ Britain, the United States, France, and other countries guarantee the safety of expatriates to Japan and guarantee to China that Japan will not use the Concession as a military base. Since this proposal was put forward, China and Japan have not yet officially replied. According to semi-official sources, Japan has already decided to reject it, while China has stated that it can accept it in principle. How this matter will develop in the future is still unknown.</p>
<p>The proposal for a neutral zone in Shanghai is very necessary from the British point of view in order to protect their huge investment interests. However, from our perspective, we should adhere to two important positions.</p>
<p>First, the outbreak of war in Shanghai was due to the challenge and aggression of Japanese imperialism against our territory. We are simply fighting back in self-defense. Therefore, as long as the Japanese army can withdraw from the Wusongkou and not use the Concession as a military base, the war in Shanghai can be ended. The so-called proposal to establish a neutral zone is not needed at all. At the same time, the Public Concession itself is inherently a neutral area, with sovereignty still belonging to China. As long as the Concession Bureau can effectively maintain this neutral status, the war in Shanghai will not escalate. The countries concerned in the past could not maintain this neutral status and prevent Japan from using the Concession as a military base. Now they are putting the cart before the horse and suggesting the establishment of a neutral zone, including the Shanghai urban area. This is something we cannot but consider carefully.</p>
<p>Secondly, the war in Shanghai is part of our country's comprehensive resistance against Japanese imperialist aggression. We will never have a local truce until Japanese aggression ends. If Shanghai can establish a neutral zone due to the relationship between the Concession and private interests, then Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places can also establish neutral zones in the same way. This will not only hinder the development of our overall resistance situation and damage the integrity of our national territorial sovereignty, but also benefit the enemy's offensive. This is a point we should carefully consider.</p>
<p>In short, we should give goodwill consideration to the neutral zone construction of friendly nations, but we should also closely consider the integrity of our territorial sovereignty and the overall situation of the war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle at Liangwangzhuang as Our Troops Advance on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line</h3>
<p>Our reinforcements arrive in Jinghai to provide support. The remaining enemies in Duliu Town are surrounded. The enemy in Liangxiang suffers setbacks and is panicked.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to transportation sources, the Japanese army on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line continued to invade on the morning of the 24th. It is reported that the artillery fire was very intense in the Liangwangzhuang area before noon, and has subsided slightly in the afternoon. The national army's front line is still near Duliu. There was heavy rain along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line, which did not stop on the 24th, making it very difficult for the Japanese army to transport supplies. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] At 7 o'clock last night, our army had already recaptured Wulidian, five miles north of Jinghai City. Currently, the enemy forces are east of Jinghai Station, and our forces are west of the station, confronting each other. The county seat is in our hands. This morning, our reinforcements arrived. Our armored vehicles engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy all night and have now moved to the front line again. Stray bullets in the station. The enemy's position is outside the North Yangqi and near Wulidian. The enemy captured our civilians, dressed them in Japanese military uniforms, and placed them unarmed at the forefront. If they shout that they are civilians or retreat, they will be killed by the second-line Korean soldiers. Advancing also means death. Our army is trying to rescue them. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>[Baoding] In order to prevent our attack, the enemy on the Pinghan Railway line has recently set up barbed wire from the east gate and south gate of Liangxiang County to Kaigezhuang, and installed flat-trajectory cannons on the city walls. Enemy tanks frequently travel between Liangxiang and Changxindian, and the situation is extremely panicked. In addition, Kaigezhuang is now stationed with five or six hundred enemy infantry and more than ten cannons, and has built a strong position, firing artillery at our army's position from time to time. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>[Baoding] Our army on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line has also won successive victories. Since the 21st, our army and the people of Duliu Town have jointly attacked the enemy entrenched in the town, heavily surrounding the enemy soldiers. The enemy was attacked from all sides and unable to cope. As a result, more than 400 were killed by us. The remaining few enemies fled to the station. Our army and civilians are closely pursuing them and are currently besieging them in the station area, which can be completely cleared soon. In addition, a certain unit of ours bombarded and intercepted the enemy's artillery position in the area north of Duliu, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, who fled madly to Liangwangzhuang, and now retreated to Yangliuqing, still appearing to retreat towards Tianjin. In total, from the 21st to the 23rd, our army won victories one after another, and the enemy was repeatedly defeated, suffering heavy casualties. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Since Sunday night, artillery fire has been heard from time to time due to favorable winds, which is very clear. Therefore, people are now speculating about the source of the artillery fire and the location of the battle. The Japanese side insists that this artillery fire is only intended to intimidate plainclothes teams. However, since the sound comes from the southwest, and some Japanese soldiers had moved southwest along the canal two days ago, and the artillery fire has been rumbling almost continuously in the past 24 hours, it is generally expected that the battle is now underway. Observers speculate that the battle may have taken place near Duliu, 15 miles from Tianjin, where the canal connects with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line. However, the details are not yet known.

<p>Enemy planes bombed Ningbo twice and scouted the Zhejiang coast.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At 8:00 p.m. on the 24th, nine enemy heavy bombers flew to the capital from the northwest, attempting a night raid. Our air force, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched fighter planes to intercept. Under threat, the enemy planes dropped two bombs in the suburbs and tried to escape. Our army suddenly flew down from the sky and strafed the enemy with machine guns, driving them to the east of Qinglong Mountain near Jurong. One enemy plane was hit and crashed, catching fire. The remaining planes fled in panic and were chased down by our planes, and another one was shot down. The location is still being investigated. The enemy's attack failed completely this time, and two more planes were lost. The casualties of the enemy pilots are also under investigation. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] Five enemy planes passed over Pingyang, Ruian, Yongjia, Qingtian, Linhai, Zhuji, and other places this afternoon. Fearing being attacked by our anti-aircraft guns, they flew very high. Two planes flew east via Yuqian, Lin'an, and Yuhang, appearing to be heading to Hangzhou. At 6:15 p.m., they flew over the city of Hangzhou without dropping bombs. Two planes flew east via Xiaoshan, and one plane flew to Ningbo via Shaoxing, Yuyao, and Cixi, dropping bombs. Enemy planes bombed Ningbo twice, the first time at 6:50 a.m. and the second time at 8:10 a.m. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>[Wuhu] An enemy heavy bomber was shot down in Guangde a few days ago and burned in Baishuitang, a suburb. Except for one pilot who died on the spot, the remaining four escaped. According to reliable sources, the four men got lost in a village in Nanxiang, looking extremely distressed. They were escorted to the county government by farmers and immediately sent to the capital for disposition. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Secretary of State Hull Calls for a Ceasefire Between China and Japan</h3>
<p>Settle Disputes Based on International Treaties. The U.S. is willing to put its peace policy into effect.</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of Defense Hull today strongly appealed for world peace, primarily directed at China and Japan. Hull also reiterated his statement of July 16 regarding U.S. foreign policy, saying that more than 50 countries have formally recognized this policy as a principle of international relations, and both China and Japan have expressed their approval. In addition, there are various international treaties, such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, which contain the same principles. Both China and Japan have signed these treaties. The U.S. government still firmly believes that these principles should be the foundation of international relations and should be universally implemented throughout the world, including the Pacific region. This statement was clearly made in response to Japan's reservations. At the same time, Hull solemnly stated that the U.S. government still intends to work hard to maintain peace in the Far East and protect its expatriates there. To this end, the government has dispatched a small number of Marines to Shanghai. The U.S. military has no intention of aggression, but wants to help maintain local security. Senator Warman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gave a radio address tonight, strongly defending President Roosevelt's unwillingness to hastily implement the Neutrality Act. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently issued an appeal to China and Japan, advising each country not to engage in war and asking both parties to resolve their current disputes based on the principles recognized by most countries in adjusting international relations. "Since the outbreak of the conflict between China and Japan, the U.S. government has been constantly urging both parties to seek peaceful solutions. The U.S. government does not trust the two strategies of forming alliances and absolute isolation. On the contrary, the U.S. government believes that only by carrying out peace work can the various goals listed in my written speech of last month be achieved." Hull further explained that the government has now taken various measures to protect U.S. expatriates in China, saying that most countries, especially the United States, have interests and rights in Shanghai, so the situation in Shanghai is particularly "special." "U.S. troops in China have the responsibility to protect expatriates, and their mission is not of an aggressive nature. However, the scope of the current Far East dispute is far beyond the urgent issue of protecting the lives and interests of expatriates. In short, the U.S. government has great faith in its peace policy and is eager to put it into effect. It will do everything possible to ensure that the various basic principles of this policy are complete and undamaged, and that they are universally implemented in the Pacific and around the world."

<h3>Shanghai Troop Withdrawal Proposal</h3>
<p>Our country's response to British statement accepts the proposal. Japan is cunning, and the British are disappointed.</p>
<p>[London] China has recently notified Britain that it is prepared to accept in principle the British proposal that Chinese and Japanese troops and warships jointly withdraw from the Shanghai area. Japan's reply has not yet arrived, but the British government is extremely disappointed with Tokyo's passive attitude. Japanese people in London all believe that Japanese reinforcements have arrived in Shanghai, and the date of victory is not far off. Therefore, they believe that if the Chinese army is driven out by the Japanese army, the need for a neutral zone will naturally disappear. Furthermore, although France has agreed to the British proposal, the United States feels that the effectiveness of this proposal depends on whether Japan complies. Judging from the current situation, it is difficult to achieve in reality. Therefore, China's agreement has no practical effect other than shifting the responsibility for rejecting everything onto Japan. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 24th)</p>
<p>[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden, and several other key cabinet members will hold a meeting in the next few days to discuss the war in Shanghai. According to British diplomatic sources, British policy is limited to protecting the Shanghai Public Concession and British interests in other places threatened by the war. This policy is not likely to change. It is expected that the cabinet members will decide to increase the number of British troops stationed in Shanghai. However, if the Japanese government can propose a compromise plan regarding the British proposal so that Western countries no longer have any concerns about the safety of expatriates and their interests in Shanghai, then Britain may not continue to send troops to Shanghai. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden is currently resting at the seaside in Hampshire. He returned to London once in the middle of last week and will do so again this week. The Foreign Secretary will visit the Foreign Office this afternoon and report the current diplomatic situation, especially the situation in the Far East, to the Lord Privy Seal, Lord Halifax, taking advantage of the Prime Minister's temporary return to London on Wednesday, and discuss related matters. The British government has not yet received replies from the Chinese and Japanese governments regarding the Shanghai neutral proposal. Semi-official circles in Tokyo seem unsympathetic to this proposal, so there is considerable disappointment here. Although Nanjing has not officially replied, it is heard that it has a tendency to agree, which pleases the British. The British authorities in Shanghai are currently doing their best to protect British expatriates, but if the war around the Concession continues for a long time, it cannot be guaranteed that there will be no accidental deaths or injuries. Therefore, women and children have been temporarily moved elsewhere to avoid various inconveniences. The British government has issued an official announcement stating that it has decided to take various plans to protect the lives and property of British expatriates in the Public Concession and ensure their safety. According to the Navy Department, British ships in China are currently stationed at the following locations: Shanghai has one cruiser and one escort ship each; Wusong has one destroyer, one flagship, and one escort ship each; Putuo Island has two cruisers and one destroyer; Qingdao has one aircraft carrier and one destroyer each; Weihaiwei has one submarine tender, one mine-laying ship, one destroyer, and one escort ship each; Yantai has one destroyer; Qinhuangdao has one destroyer; Dagu has one escort ship; Nanjing has one cruiser. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 24th)</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Telegraph published an editorial today entitled "Japan's Dangerous Attempt," saying that if the Shanghai Public Concession is kept out of the war zone, the safety of Japanese expatriates can be guaranteed. The mediation by all parties seems to be rejected by Japan, which must be acknowledged. The steady forces in Japan have now been trampled on by the war-mongering military cliques. All those who sympathize with the Japanese Restoration cannot help but regret the decisions of the current Japanese authorities, which harm everything they have gained in the unprecedented progress of the past fifty years. Japan is now participating in battles in two places with a large army, and there is a trend to extend it to other places. Its financial and economic resources are unable to cope. Japan's assets, used for business in China, are already dwindling, and the benefits promised to its people in the new area of activity have not been realized. It may not be too late for Japanese politicians to discuss whether it is worth betting the country's entire economy on the victory of its continued aggression. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 24th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Ambassador Returns Home; British Attention</h3>
<p>Ambassador Gu Visits French Authorities</p>
<p>[London] Diplomatic circles here are paying close attention to the rumor that the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Bingham, is returning to Washington because it is related to Britain's proposal to form a joint U.S.-French front in Shanghai. Although this rumor has not been confirmed as of now, it is quite possible that Britain will make this proposal. However, there is no intention on the part of the U.S. to do so. Although the United States has expressed support for the British proposal to establish a neutral zone in Shanghai, it has stated that this is a purely passive measure, and the U.S. government has not considered any active measures. (National Maritime Telegraph dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the war between China and Japan, the only issue that the U.S. government is currently paying attention to is the protection of U.S. expatriates in Shanghai and other places in China. President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and the President's key advisers, including senior army and navy generals, did not leave Washington last Saturday and Sunday because they wanted to pay close attention to the development of the situation in the Far East. The seriousness of the situation is evident. Regarding the protection of expatriates, the State Department had already instructed U.S. consuls in various parts of China to strongly advise their nationals to leave the war zone as soon as possible. However, these expatriates, on the one hand, have invested huge sums of money in China and are unwilling to give up, and on the other hand, they believe that they are under the protection of consular jurisdiction and do not worry about anything else. It is not easy to get them to withdraw. In addition, regarding the U.S. implementation of the Neutrality Act, well-informed sources believe that this move would only benefit Japan. President Roosevelt has decided to postpone it as much as possible. However, if Japan launches a large-scale attack on China, President Roosevelt will naturally implement it, which may not be entirely beneficial to Japan, because Japan will then have to buy goods from the United States in cash and use its own ships to transport them, which would be very inconvenient for Japan. The U.S. authorities have considered prohibiting the export of certain raw materials, such as pig iron, copper, and kerosene, to China and Japan, but they believe that if this move were to be implemented, Japan would definitely object immediately.

<p>[Washington] The Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Yarnell, reported to the Navy Department today that after a detailed investigation of the incident in which the U.S. flagship Augusta was hit by a stray bullet in the Huangpu River, it was impossible to prove the source of the bullet. All seventeen sailors who were injured have gradually recovered and are in no danger. However, both China and Japan have been asked to pay special attention to the direction of artillery fire in the future. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Germany Worries About the Escalation of the War</h3>
<p>Affects Export Trade</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the war between China and Japan, German business and export people are deeply concerned about the expansion of the scope of the conflict between China and Japan, and say that German trade with China occupies an important position in Germany's total foreign trade, but it has now completely stalled. For example, China recently ordered a large batch of railway materials from Germany that could not be shipped to China, which is one example. Some observers now believe that Germany's future attitude towards the Far East incident may be based on the above-mentioned economic points. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>The Sino-Japanese War Is Bound to Be Protracted</h3>
<p>Paris Times Commentary</p>
<p>[Paris] The "Times" recently commented on the Sino-Japanese situation, saying, "Judging from the current situation, a large-scale conflict between China and Japan is bound to be protracted. Will Japan decide to mobilize a large number of troops to protect its military prestige? Will China support a long-term war of resistance on all fronts? The current situation in Shanghai is very chaotic. Foreign concessions continue to suffer from the military influence of both sides, resulting in disturbances. If the safety of the concessions is not respected one day, the future disasters will be unimaginable. After the failure of the British proposal for the neutralization of Shanghai, the major powers are now jointly considering submitting diplomatic negotiations to both China and Japan again. The "Japan Times" has already declared that the war will last for at least one year. However, Japanese Army Minister Sugiyama said that Japan should quickly achieve military victory and never allow the war to be protracted, so it will adopt an offensive strategy. However, whether Japan can win in a short period of time depends on China's military strength. Regarding this level, although there is no definite information to prove it, it seems credible that China has unexpected military strength. As far as Japan is concerned, if the war zone expands more and more, it will not be in Japan's interest. Although Japan does not have to use all its national power to engage in war, it can engage in war with great strength, but after the area of responsibility expands, the military strength is dispersed, and it will naturally be impossible to win quickly. Based on the above difficulties, it is not known whether China and Japan can still open the door to negotiations. If so, countries related to the Far East can find ways to promote this negotiation," (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas telegram)</p>

<h3>The Commercial Press Raises 50,000 Yuan for National Salvation Donations</h3>
<p>The company and its colleagues each contribute half of the amount. 10,000 taels of gold will be sent monthly starting at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Commercial Press has stipulated the following measures to raise 90,000 yuan for national salvation donations: ㊀ 50,000 yuan for national salvation losses will be borne equally by the company and all colleagues. ㊁ Half of the 25,000 yuan borne by the company will be deducted from the cash revenue of the Shanghai Distribution Office and the cash remitted by various branches at 5% starting from August 1 until this amount is satisfied. ㊂ Half of the 25,000 yuan borne by colleagues will be used to collect the interest on long-term incentive savings for the six months from April to September of this year. The interest donated by each person in the previous item will be rounded up to 5 jiao if it is less than 5 jiao, and rounded up to 1 yuan if it is more than 5 jiao but less than 1 yuan. ㊃ For donations in the third item, the company will print a voluntary letter, distribute it to depositors for signature and confirmation, and then send it to the accounting department for deduction by the personnel department. When the voluntary donation in the previous item is less than 25,000 yuan, colleagues will make up for it with special donations. ㊄ Those who do not have long-term incentive savings but are willing to make special donations, or those who have long-term incentive savings and are willing to make additional donations, may join. For special donations and additional donations in the previous item, the person should contact the personnel department. Those in branches and factories should contact the managers and factory directors of the respective branches and factories and report to the personnel department. ㊅ The funds jointly donated by the company and its colleagues will be sent by the company to the official receiving agency for national salvation donations in five monthly installments of 10,000 yuan each, from the end of August to the end of December of this year. If there is a balance, it will be included in the fifth month's payment. It is commendable that the company is cooperating with labor and management in this extraordinary period to repay the country with huge sums of money. There are many factories in Shanghai with strong financial resources, and they should be inspired by this.</p>

It is also reliably learned that the Kurume Division of the Japanese reinforcements to Shanghai has successively landed in Hongkou, Wusong, Zhanghuabang, Yunzaobang, and Lion Forest for combat. Because the positions were not secure, they suffered repeated defeats. More than half of them have been killed or injured, and their strength has been sharply reduced and they are completely defeated.</p>
<h3>Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses on Nanhui Beach</h3>
<p>Luring the Enemy Deep and Concentrating Firepower to Sweep, Enemy Troops Were Caught Off Guard and Suffered More Than 1,000 Casualties</p>
<p>According to reliable information, at about 6:00 am yesterday, more than a dozen enemy warships, accompanied by dozens of small boats, arrived at the sea off Nanhui Beach and immediately used platoon guns to concentrate firepower and bombard our onshore positions fiercely. After a while, small boats fully loaded with infantry, about 1,200 people, carrying light machine guns and other military equipment, quickly approached the beach. The tide surged ashore. Our defending troops feigned weakness at the time and only used a small number of troops to deal with the enemy. The enemy then took advantage of the situation to go deep. When most of our defending troops waited for the enemy to gain a firm foothold, they used machine guns to concentrate firepower and sweep at the enemy's densely formed teams. At the same time, they used artillery fire to threaten the enemy's retreat. The enemy was in a panic. Our army seized the opportunity to charge and engage in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy was defeated, and there were heavy casualties. In this battle, only a hundred or so enemy troops survived. Our division suffered slight damage.</p>
<p>According to further news, the remaining enemy troops of about one hundred and several tens of people in Nanhui are still being surrounded and intercepted by our army on three sides. Because the beach there is very wide and the way back is cut off by our firepower.</p>
<h3>No Enemy Traces Along the Wusong Coast</h3>
<p>There are still 200-300 Remaining Enemies in Yunzaobang, Surrounded by Our Army, Unable to Break Through and Get on Ships</p>

The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Currently, there are still 200-300 remaining enemies in Yunzaobang, surrounded by our army and unable to break through and get on ships. They are still struggling. It is expected that they will be wiped out in one fell swoop this morning. Also, enemy corpses are scattered everywhere along the river and cannot be collected. The situation is extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>Two Enemy Warships Sunk After Being Hit</h3>
<p>Our Army Has Strong Strength Along the River and Coast, Enemy Troops Will Never Be Able to Cross the Thunder Pond</p>
<p>According to reports from those who returned to Shanghai from the front, at 5:00 pm yesterday, our artillery team densely used heavy artillery to fiercely attack the enemy warships outside Wusongkou that were covering the enemy's landing. Two enemy ships were hit and sunk.</p>
<p>It is reliably learned that the rumors that the enemy troops landing outside the port had broken through our army's line of defense and had penetrated into a certain area are completely unfounded. According to reliable special news from the military, our side has deployed very strong forces at various ports along the river and coast. Recently, we have also reinforced the key points in each place with more than one division of troops. Even if the enemy troops want to desperately open a bloody path, they will absolutely not be able to cross the Thunder Pond.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: This morning (25th), around 0:05 and 1:30, our air force dispatched several times over the Huangpu River and Wusongkou to bomb enemy ships. The moonlight was bright and there were no clouds for thousands of miles, but the sound of engines was incessant. The enemy ships at Songkou and on the Huangpu River used searchlights to shine and fired anti-aircraft guns indiscriminately. Because the drivers were brave and careful and had superb skills, they were still exceptionally active among the enemy ships. Several bombs were dropped at the time, and machine guns were fired. According to several Western passengers on the Canadian Empress, who arrived at Songkou yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning, they witnessed a gunboat anchored outside Songkou being sunk by us and a destroyer being hit in the stern and seriously injured.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Jiangwan Position</h3>
<p>The Top Floor of the Enemy Headquarters Has Been Confirmed to Be Destroyed by Our Bombing, Last Night's Small Contact, Our Artillery Destroyed the Enemy's Observation Post</p>
<p>This morning, a new mortar platoon leader from the X Division, Chuan Jinshan, arrived at a certain wounded soldier hospital. According to Platoon Leader Fu, who recognized the reporter from this newspaper, he has a long-term stomach problem and took the opportunity to be transferred to the hospital for treatment, and was not injured. The reporter asked about the recent situation on Jiangwan Road. According to him, the enemy troops are still entrenched in the southeast of Jiangwan Road, stubbornly resisting, relying on their extremely solid national defense work. Our army has repeatedly advanced and retreated at Baziqiao, which is a strategic relationship and it is not convenient to go deep, so they are still in a stalemate. At Chizhi College, the battle was very fierce at the beginning, and the school building has now been completely turned into ashes. Our army occupies the northeast corner of Hongkou Park. The top floor of the enemy headquarters at the Jiangwan Road intersection has been confirmed to have been destroyed by our army's artillery fire and bombs. The enemy's air force is very active and flies very low, using machine guns to strafe our positions. The wounded soldiers who entered the hospital today were injured by their air force last night.

<h3>The Enemy's Attempt to Shift the Battle Situation Failed</h3>
<p>Reinforcing Three Divisions to Relieve the Siege of Hongkou, Our Head-on Pain Sound Landing Attempt Failed</p>
<p>The enemy troops in the Changshu, Hongkou area have fallen into a state of exhaustion, and the time of their annihilation must not be far away. From the beginning, the enemy's battle on this line was in a passive position, controlled by our superior forces, and unable to shift the battle situation. Now, the enemy wants to resolve the crisis in the Shanghai battle situation in order to use quick battles and quick decisions to defeat our army. Therefore, they reinforced three divisions to Shanghai, wanting to land with superior forces, contain the battle situation, and reverse their tragic situation. For several days, they have been attempting to land at various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and along the coast of Nanhui, but they have been repelled by our army and suffered great losses. It is expected that after suffering this heavy blow, the enemy troops will not dare to invade again in the short term.</p>

<h3>Wang Jingjiu, Commander of the Division, Inscribed Words for This Newspaper</h3>
<h3>There Is a Saying That the Enemy Troops Have Changed Their Commanders</h3>
<p>Leading a Reinforced Division to Shanghai, Repeated Landing Failures Drained Their Spirit</p>
<p>Xin Xin She said, reliable news, the enemy troops have indeed been successively sent to Shanghai, about one division, which is drawn from the troops stationed in the country, so the number is about 15,000 people. The rumor that there are two divisions is actually a false show of strength by the enemy. The commander-in-chief is Matsui Ishine, who is here to replace the commander of the Third Fleet, Hasegawa, in charge of the battle. The enemy, who has been trying to land at Wusongkou for several days, is the enemy's reinforcements, but after being severely damaged by our army, the large number of enemy troops trapped in the ships have lost their spirit.</p>
<h3>The Waibaidu Bridge Is Moored by British Warships</h3>

The extent of the loss can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Zhangbei Officially Recovered</h3>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] Zhangbei is an important town outside the pass, and the enemy regards it as a lifeline. Therefore, it has been repeatedly gained and lost. After a dozen hand-to-hand combats, at 12:00 pm on the 19th, Liu Ruming personally led his troops to climb the city and charge before officially recovering it. The enemy suffered countless casualties and retreated to Baochang and Guyuan. We are sending teams to pursue them. Hundreds of men and women have been successively arrested in Zhang these days and are being interrogated. (20th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Our Army Fought Bravely to Repel the Enemy in the Counties of Liangxiang and Fangshan</h3>
<p>In Areas Such as Meierling and Lutantan</p>
<p>[Baoding] The troops in Meierling, Lutantan, Pingdingshan, Beicheying, Nanliyuan and other areas in our Liangxiang and Fangshan counties repelled the enemy separately on the morning of the 23rd. At 7:00 am on the 20th, the enemy used a combined force of infantry and cavalry of more than 500 people to launch a fierce attack on our Magaozhuang and Yangtougang positions on the border of Fangshan County under the cover of tanks and artillery fire. Another part of the enemy, about 200 people, advanced towards our Nanguan and Bashimudi positions from the Dafangchang area. The battle situation was extremely fierce. Our officers and soldiers calmly responded to the battle, and the enemy failed. We used guerrilla troops to cross the river from a certain place to attack the enemy's rear. The enemy suffered heavy losses and casualties and retreated in a panic. Also, in the Beicheying area, after our army defeated the invading enemy at 11:00 pm on the 22nd, it captured the surrounding villages and highlands and took advantage of the situation to attack Xiangyuan and Xiaojueer. On the one hand, we sent plainclothes troops to attack Lutantan. The enemy was attacked from the front and back and collapsed. Our army captured Lutantan and the surrounding highlands and advanced to the road from Shan Lutantan to Dafangchang on the 13th morning. At 8:00 am on the 22nd, the enemy once again attempted to counterattack our Beicheying position. Our army fought fiercely. At 2:00 pm, the enemy opened four cannons and bombarded our position with more than 400 shells. At 4:00 pm, the enemy increased to more than 800 people. Our officers and soldiers, seeing the enemy repeatedly reinforcing, knew that its main force had already been shaken and were extremely excited. They engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Because our army's morale was increasing day by day, their courage was taken away. The artillery fire they fired was completely ineffective and disintegrated. Also, in the Shitituli area, the enemy used a combined force of infantry and artillery of more than 500 people to attack our Pingdingshan and Zhaojiazhuang positions and used smoke screens in an attempt to cover up. Our army rushed forward, and another small unit detoured out of the left side of Dingshan and engaged in fierce battles with us, and launched a fierce artillery attack. Our two companies, Dan Moumou, bravely died at this time, but the enemy suffered even more casualties. In the end, our army defeated them. In this battle, the enemy fought with the main force of the Pinghan Line and used various new weapons to help the battle. Our soldiers, without exception, were brave and fought fiercely for the highlands and fought bloodily with the enemy for several days, going in and out seven times. Although the enemy reinforced again, they ultimately failed. The number of their deaths was several times that of ours. The stubborn enemy was very depressed after this blow.

However, many of those that were halfway through loading have been resold to Chizhou Port and will not proceed to Shanghai.

<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>A telegram from London on the 24th states that China has informed Britain that it is prepared, in principle, to accept Britain's proposal for the joint withdrawal of Chinese and Japanese troops and warships from the Shanghai area. Japan's response has not yet arrived, and the British government is quite disappointed. Japan is an aggressor nation, and our country is a nation that has been invaded. Our country sincerely wishes for peace. However, under the principle of "joint withdrawal," it may be acceptable. Otherwise, we can only offer the advice of "resisting the enemy to the end" and await Japan's own repentance.</p>
<p>The Japan Times claims that the war will last for at least a year. However, Army Minister Sugiyama says that Japan should quickly achieve victory militarily and will not allow it to drag on. Therefore, it will adopt an offensive posture. This statement is truly bizarre. Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, when and where has Japan ever taken a defensive posture militarily? Our troops have always taken a defensive posture, waiting quietly for a year or two before speaking again.</p>

<h3>The Pinghan Frontline (3)</h3>
<p>— Xi Min</p>
<p>What impressed me most on the front lines were two things: first, the general decline in the morale of the people in the north and the laxity of popular organizations; and second, the particular rampancy of traitorous activities. China has always been a nation of disunity. In recent years, due to the severity of the national crisis, the central and southern provinces of China have trained many militia teams under the attention of the government, which can be regarded as having made some progress. However, in the Hebei Province, past political measures have often been somewhat at odds with the central government, so the training and instruction of farmers, who constitute the vast majority of the population, has always been neglected. Farmers have limited knowledge of national consciousness. Because they lack training and practical understanding, it is simply impossible to enrich and develop it. This shortcoming is particularly serious today, when the entire Chinese nation needs to participate in the war of resistance! The famous German general Ludendorff once said that the unity of the spirit of the entire nation is the basic condition for victory in war. This is truly an immutable conclusion. But in Germany, its war effort is aimed at outward expansion, invading small nations and countries. This war is only for the purpose of securing reasons for Germany's economic relief and acquiring markets for manufactured goods, so the benefits of the war are not for the majority of the Chinese people but for a few upper-class elites. Because of this, in order to mobilize the whole nation to fight and shed blood for the sake of a few capitalists in order to compete for markets, Germany's ambitious soldiers had to create a false theory that the Germanic nation is inherently the most superior, and actively exclude Jews, arguing that communism and religion are Jewish conspiracies. They used such far-fetched methods to unify the spirit of the nation. Although we cannot help but admire the efforts of military conspirators, the people will inevitably recognize the falsity of these theories from the facts. Japan, the only robber in the East, is now mobilizing the entire nation to invade China. The methods and goals of their fascist soldiers are absolutely identical in nature to those of Germany in the West, so their results will be just as unsuccessful. Although the soldiers of the invading country have emphasized the importance of unifying the spirit of the entire nation, the social structure will ultimately make their efforts vanish into thin air.</p>
<p>However, in our China, things are completely different. China is a nation oppressed by Japanese imperialism, and the entire nation unanimously demands to overthrow the enemy who is invading their territory and sovereignty and to strive for national freedom and independence. Therefore, as long as the war of resistance breaks out, the entire nation will unite sincerely and unanimously. Our national spiritual unity does not need to create theories that violate the truth, as Ludendorff did. However, the morale of the people in the north is unexpectedly low, which is almost inexplicable to us, and the laxity of the organization due to the decline of morale is undoubtedly a major defect in the establishment of the great combat power of the entire nation against the enemy. Therefore, the organization and training of the people is particularly necessary in the front. In order to achieve the final victory in the War of Resistance, how to organize and train the people, so that the strength of the people is organically linked to the fighting of the army brothers, should be the most urgent task today. When the reporter met Mr. Wen Guolin, the director of the training department of a certain division on the front line, he talked to me very sincerely about the various difficulties in organizing the people in the front and the difficulty in carrying out political training work in the army. After careful consideration of this issue, I feel that the organization and training of the people in the future must be carried out in close cooperation between the army, the government, and popular organizations in order to achieve results.</p>
<p>On the front lines, we heard many extremely serious rumors that local administrative officials in a few counties had abandoned their cities and fled before the enemy was even discovered. How can such administrative officials lead the people and train the people? Therefore, this reminds me that the national salvation groups in the rear should strive to cultivate personnel who are deeply rooted in the people.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the issue of traitors, traitors can be captured from time to time on the front lines. Among these arrested traitors, eight or nine out of ten are poor wretches who cannot solve their livelihood problems and are driven by the enemy at extremely low prices. Their skills are very poor. One night, the reporter stayed at a certain commander's residence on the front line. The station sent a traitor, and asked him where he worked. He said that he was a brother in the 37th Division of the 29th Army. When asked who the commander of the 37th Division was, he was stunned and did not know how to answer. The enemy drives such traitors not to inquire about military intelligence, but mainly to sabotage transportation and so on. For a few dollars, they forget their motherland and risk their lives for the enemy. It is both painful and pitiful to think about.</p>
<p>The reporter has long believed that the most fundamental way to deal with these traitors is to step up the organization and training of the people and raise the people's enthusiasm for patriotism and resistance to the enemy. In this way, the people can directly eliminate the local traitors, making it impossible for the traitors to act. At the same time, the army is indeed very serious about paying attention to traitors, but there are also shortcomings, because I feel that whether it is the government, the army, or popular organizations, there should be a special organization responsible for eliminating traitorous organizations, so that there can be systematic investigation and cracking down. When we capture traitors, we should not only impose severe punishment, but more importantly, we should use various methods to get him to confess his accomplices in order to wipe them out in one fell swoop. This is definitely not something that ordinary military officers or brothers can handle. As a result of the reporter's investigations in various places, many traitors have been transferred east and west after being arrested, and extradited to the second and third agencies for interrogation and sentencing. The time is dragged on for a long time, which can allow the traitor's accomplices to make preparations, and it is naturally much more difficult to capture them. I hope that the government's special service groups should all go to the front lines of the War of Resistance at this time to specialize in eliminating traitors, and popular organizations in the rear should also double their efforts in publicizing and acting to eliminate traitors.</p>
<p>As a result of the reporter's observations on the front lines, I am not concerned about the strength of my country's army's combat capabilities regarding the final victory of our country's War of Resistance. What is most urgent is to pay attention to how the people and the army will become one in the future. I would like to end this article with this sentence, hoping that everyone will pay attention to this issue.</p>
<h3>The Federation of Commerce Associations Calls on Merchants Nationwide to Donate Money to Relieve the National Crisis</h3>
<p>Everyone should contribute to the country to the best of their ability. The first national salvation donation will be made up of business income and worker's wages.</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce Associations of this city wired to all provincial and district commerce associations and commerce associations at home and abroad yesterday, (Briefly): Extremely Urgent. It has been found that since the Lugouqiao Incident, the bulwark of peace in East Asia has been destroyed by the enemy. The self-defense war of resistance of our Chinese nation has also begun at this time. The recent defense of Nankou, the recovery of Chahar Province, the battle of Shanghai, and the defense of various places, the enemy has exhausted the full power of the navy, army, and air force, and ultimately failed to succeed. This fully demonstrates the central government's determination to respond comprehensively and the loyalty of our front-line soldiers to sacrifice their lives on the border. However, the strong invaders are still not at ease, and the self-defense resistance has a long way to go. At this critical moment, we should strengthen the unity of the people and concentrate the strength of the people to overcome the national crisis together. This month, on July 30th, a telegram was sent to the National Federation of Commerce Associations and people from all walks of life to organize anti-Japanese support associations in various places, and it is assumed that it has been handled accordingly. Now it is the beginning of a long-term resistance, which is also the moment of final sacrifice. All Chinese people should contribute to the country to the best of their ability. Our soldiers have already fought with blood and flesh as the vanguard, and our people should contribute wealth to support the rear. This telegram is sent to your association, hoping that you will investigate and, in addition to working hard to guide free donations, also inform various factories and stores to completely donate one day's business income and various staff and workers to donate one day's wages, collect them to your association, and directly remit them to the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government in the two capitals as the first national salvation donation for merchants nationwide. To save the country by destroying families, Bu Shi was a model in the Han Dynasty, and Zheng Youxian was a model in donating wealth to reward the army. People today should not give way to the ancients. This matter concerns the life and death of the entire nation and country. Please pay attention to handling it carefully and earnestly. Sincerely pray, President Lin Kanghou of the National Federation of Commerce Associations of the Republic of China respectfully kowtows.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Donations from All Sides</h3>

<h3>Brief Report on Rescue and Repatriation</h3>
<p>Rescue</p>
<p>Military training students in this city, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, have asked the military authorities to volunteer their services. A model student brigade has now been established. The team has been going to the front for rescue and condolences in recent days, and their work is extremely tense. It is reported that the team also dispatched recruiting teams to go in different directions to collect comfort items directly from the public. The Red Swastika Society relief team set off in two routes at 3:00 AM yesterday, one to the Dachang Zhenru area and one to the front to rescue 28 wounded soldiers, who were sent to the society's third hospital for treatment. The association also noted that the refugee shelters were full, and that many of them were women and children who were eager to return to their hometowns. Therefore, they negotiated with the Ningbo Fellow Association to issue free boat tickets to the refugees for repatriation. The Refugee Relief Committee of the Shanghai Charity Group Joint Relief Association, in view of the many refugees injured in the war zone, specially organized a monk rescue team to go to the war zone to rescue injured soldiers and civilians.</p>
<p>Repatriation</p>
<p>The Relief Committee of this city, in view of the large number of refugees in Shanghai, has been sending people to Songjiang, Hangzhou, and Suzhou in recent days, and has sent more than 10,000 people. In addition, in order to facilitate the employment of boats or vehicles by various fellow associations to send refugees, the group specially requested the Jinghu Garrison Headquarters to issue passes. If the various fellow associations wish to receive them, they can contact Mr. Shao Xubai of the repatriation team of the Pudong Fellow Association.</p>
<p>The Chinese Yellow Swastika Society has established a refugee shelter in the Dashi World, which has reached 1,500 people. In addition to more than 200 refugees who have left the shelter voluntarily, 140 more people have been taken out by the Relief Committee's legacy group and sent to Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places.</p>
<p>The Dinghai Fellow Association held a meeting yesterday and decided to hire a boat to send the affected fellow villagers back to their hometown. However, they must first register with the association.</p>
<p>The Wujiang Shanghai Fellow Association sent another batch of refugees it had taken in yesterday, numbering about 100 or more. In the future, if there are fellow villagers from the county who require shelter or repatriation, they can register with the association at 31 Tongchunfang, Baker Road. The Yunnan Shanghai Fellow Association plans to find a way to provide funds to send the affected fellow villagers back to their hometown. It is reported that it has contacted a British shipping company and booked berths. All fellow villagers must register with Jin Canjun at the Comfort Goods Collection Office of the Anti-Japanese Support Association of the Guangxia Middle School at the intersection of Foch Road and Moore Road within three days in order to reserve berths. No more registrations will be accepted after the deadline.</p>

<h3>Rumors are Rife in Xiamen, and Many Residents are Moving to Gulangyu</h3>
<p>Thousands of people have moved to Hong Kong in the past few days. Business circles in southern Fujian automatically refuse enemy goods. Bandits are willingly acting as traitors and are being hunted down.</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence. Of the Japanese warships stationed in Xiamen, the cruiser Yubari has been in Xiamen since its arrival on July 9 and has not gone elsewhere. The rest come and go without a fixed pattern and are anchored behind Gulangyu without any other action. Therefore, Xiamen appears to be calm on the surface, but rumors are rampant. Since the 3rd of this month, many people have moved to Hong Kong and Gulangyu. Wealthy people are moving to Hong Kong in large numbers, and middle-class families are moving to Gulangyu. On the 8th and 9th, as many as 1,000 people went to Hong Kong by boat. Including the previous week, a total of more than 3,000 people have gone. On the 12th, several hundred more people went to Hong Kong by boat. Those who returned home after doing business in the Nanyang region and those who have relatives and friends to turn to in the Nanyang region have also traveled to the Nanyang region by British, Dutch, and Philippine ships. The number of people moving to Gulangyu was especially large on the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th. Moving carts and boats can be seen everywhere. According to estimates by rice shops, the population of Gulangyu has increased by more than 10,000 in recent days. Many people from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in the interior have also moved to Gulangyu. In recent years, Gulangyu has lost its importance, and property prices have fallen, with many empty houses. However, within a few days, they have all been rented out. Families with spare houses and landlords with houses to vacate are also renting them out, and many are renting houses in case they need to move. Rents have soared, increasing fourfold compared to normal times, and contracts are only allowed if four months' rent is paid in advance. As for the prices of goods on Gulangyu, they have also risen sharply, which shows the unease in people's hearts.</p>
<p>The military and political circles in the interior of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou are very active in preparing for emergencies, and the anti-Japanese support movement and the fundraising movement are also very enthusiastic. The merchants and people of the counties in southern Fujian have automatically refused enemy goods and have held meetings to establish oaths. They will be implemented immediately. For example, all merchants in Anxi swore not to buy or sell enemy goods, and those who violate the oath will be regarded as traitors. Stone Code cloth merchants swore that those who violate the oath three times will be subject to the confiscation of all property. On the 11th, the Shishi cloth merchants returned the shipped enemy goods in their original boxes to Xiamen. All other counties are doing the same.</p>
<p>A small number of frustrated bandits in southern Fujian have recently engaged in traitorous activities, such as Zhang Xiongnan and Chen Weijin, who have gone back to Dehua and Nan'an in Jinjiang, and Lü Zhenshan and Guo Zong, who have contacted certain parties in Xiamen and Hong Kong. However, Zhang and Chen are difficult to suppress because of their scars, and Lü has only a few hundred people and is being besieged in Yongchun. Guo has only 20 or 30 people. Zheng Mingzhi, the current captain of the Quan Shui De car road guard team, was bought by a certain party to be the head of the traitors in Jinjiangnan'an. On the night of the 7th, Zheng went from Jiudu in Nan'an to Quanzhou City and was surrounded and arrested by the garrison on Dajie Street. Zheng escaped by car that night. A search of the city that night yielded nothing. On the night of the 8th, the garrison captured Zheng's wife, Xie Xiuying, his son, Zheng Jinchun, and nine others in Jiudu and sent them to Quanzhou. They also confiscated the weapons of Zheng's road guard team in Honglai. According to reports, Zheng was originally a famous bandit in southern Fujian and served as a battalion commander in Chen Guohui's troops. He owned a number of firearms. Last year, he served as the captain of the Quan Yong De road guard team and was then bought by a certain party. He moved his family to Jiudu, and he himself often took his own car to run around Quanzhou and Yongchun, and his activities were mysterious.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Captures Disguised Enemy Spy</h3>
<p>—Also Detains Several Suspects—</p>
<p>Yangzhou Dispatch: The Jiangdu Police Bureau on the morning of the 18th, arrested a person of unknown nationality who did not speak the language, resembling an enemy spy. He was escorted to the county government, where Magistrate Ma interrogated him and provided paper and pen, ordering him to write a confession. He wrote the characters "Door Hundred Big Three." He was immediately sent to the political police station. This reporter, upon receiving the news, went to investigate and saw him bareheaded and barefoot, wearing only dirty white cloth shorts, looking like a beggar. However, his eyes were bright and piercing. He had foot bindings. He sat with his knees bent, his soles facing upwards, supporting his buttocks. He was also instructed to write his origins, and he wrote "Exit Pass People" not door path "Plant Middle Fire" light ash born sky fire □" and other characters. At that time, the court was opened again, and this reporter attended the hearing. The interrogating officer interrogated him in Japanese, but he mumbled continuously, with only one phrase discernible, sounding like the Shanghai dialect for "twenty-one years old." The interrogating officer, unable to proceed, sent him back to detention. Later, a request was made to detain him with the special affairs team. It was reported that he had previously been in a certain field in the western suburbs, where he was arrested and sent to the police station. However, after interrogation, there was no recordable confession. He was released on parole and police were dispatched to follow him back to his residence, but he returned to the police station and was sent to the county government. After the court hearing, an examination of his physique showed that his skin color from his waist to below his knees was white, proving that his hair, skin, face, and appearance were all disguised. According to several cart pullers, a month ago, he had been disguised as a semi-mute and foolish beggar around the bridge in the sixth district of Yiling County. The Yiling police station on the morning of the 18th, escorted a suspected traitor, Wang Yunru (from Hebei), to Yangzhou. Wang had only practiced medicine in Yiling for a short time when he was inspected by the local Baozhang (chief of a bao, a unit of local administration), and the police searched his residence, seizing nine seals, a diary, a detailed map of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line, a map of Zhenjiang, and two personal business cards with the title of former Songjiang County Physician. He is currently being interrogated at the police station. On the same day, a young man surnamed Shen, who lived in the alley opposite the Longevity Temple in the city, who usually wore Western suits and leather shoes, suddenly disguised himself as a vegetable vendor and cut telephone lines, which was discovered. He is suspected of being a traitor and was also arrested by a certain agency. Another young man surnamed Meng is being held for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Hospital Visit to Refugee Mothers</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Twins, six-month miscarriage, mother's life in danger. Funding is insufficient, hoping for enthusiastic donations from all sectors.</p>
<p>(Special Report from this Newspaper) Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, compatriots from the war zones have crowded into the concessions, and some have even come from the four suburbs of Shanghai. They have managed to save their lives, but their property may have already been sacrificed in the fierce artillery fire. Who caused these countless homeless refugees to encounter such a tragic situation? This is something we must clearly understand. Our lives and property can be sacrificed, but we must give the ambitious aggressors of militarist countries a head-on blow. This reporter has visited several refugee shelters. Although they feel the sadness of wives and children being separated and families being destroyed, they eagerly hope for the "final victory," and they believe that the "final victory" belongs to us.</p>
<p>Currently, according to statistics, there are about 120,000 refugees in Shanghai and more than 200 shelters. The shelters provide two bowls of porridge and one meal a day, so survival is naturally not a problem. However, there are many expectant mothers among the refugees, and we should plan for them as soon as possible. Therefore, six female obstetricians from Huimin and Renhe Hospitals, Zhang Liling, Sheng Mingqi, Yan Yongjiang, Guo Huizhen, Lu Mingyu, and Zhang Biru, along with Mr. Wang Yuefeng, organized a "Shanghai Refugee Maternity Hospital." The hospital is temporarily located at 1085 Gordon Road, at the Living Kindergarten. This reporter made a special visit this morning.</p>
<p>After sending in a business card, Dr. Sheng Wenqi very diligently hosted a tour of the facilities. First, we went to the delivery room, where a delivery bed was placed in the center, and against the wall were two cabinets filled with surgical instruments and various medicinal liquids. Because part of the school was used for the setup, the equipment is naturally a bit simple. But for pregnant women, this is such a great manifestation of the spirit of human mutual assistance.</p>
<p>The wards are three classrooms, with a total of eighty beds now. The number can be increased to one hundred if needed. Deliveries are handled by the six doctors mentioned above, with Miss Zhang Liling as the chief physician. She went to Osaka, Japan, to study at the Red Cross Hospital last January, and because of the outbreak of the Shanghai War, she returned to the country to establish this "Refugee Maternity Hospital." There are nine nurses, three of whom were sleeping in the ward last night because they were on the night shift. This spirit of service deserves commendation!</p>
<p>There are currently two pregnant women in the hospital. One was sent from the Nanyang Wireless Telegraph Training School on Baylor Road (which also houses refugees). Perhaps the fetus was injured while fleeing, and she miscarried last night. The fetus was only four months old. Who is responsible for this innocent little life? I can't help but ask. Fortunately, the mother is safe.</p>
<p>The other was sent from the Great World Shelter. She was also injured on the day of the bombing and miscarried at six months, and they were twins. Dr. Sheng also guided me to see this pair of ill-fated infants. They were placed quietly in a porcelain basin like a pair of kittens, their eyes closed. They did not see the brutal actions of the militarist country. Is this fortunate or unfortunate? The mother bled excessively because the placenta did not come out for a long time during the miscarriage, and she may have caught a cold during the typhoon that passed through Shanghai that day. She now has "postpartum fever" and has not yet emerged from the danger period. When this reporter went to the ward, I saw her staring at us. Her face was as pale as wax paper, and her breathing was a bit rapid. I originally wanted to ask her about her escape and the miscarriage, but seeing such a tragic situation, how could I bear to ask her to speak? She may be thinking of her husband, whose survival is uncertain, and her two lovely children. This is truly an extreme human tragedy!</p>
<p>Dr. Sheng finally told me that this "Refugee Maternity Hospital" is a private organization, and funding is not very sufficient. She hopes that all sectors will make enthusiastic donations. This not only benefits pregnant women but is also a very important task for the rear.</p>
<p>One more thing to clarify is that the hospital accepts pregnant women sent from various refugee shelters or with a valid certificate. Even if you call, they will still make house calls. The telephone number is 37766.</p>
