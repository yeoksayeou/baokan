<h3>橫渡太平洋大飛船計晝</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>自中國和美國間的橫渡太平洋翦風式飛機航行成功。定期航綫開關後。美國的朝野。又汲汲乎計劃着橫渡太平洋的大飛船。據本月二日上海泰晤士報的記載。美國齊泊林運輸公司。擬建築大飛船兩艘。作定期的橫渡太平洋飛行。該公司已經向美國國會要求津貼。並將應用美國特產的氦氣。以代替輕氣。乘齊泊林大飛船。自美國舊金山到香港。只需四天。比太平洋翦風式飛機的航程。减短了兩天而每隻飛船。每次可載客七十人。據美國商業部負責人員談話。至遲在兩年以內。這個計劃。定可實現。</p>
<p>美國積極從事於太平洋面的航空發展。在商業上。在政治上。以至於在軍事上都有很重大的意義。就商務上說。目前世界的商務競爭。凡是控制着最重要國際航空綫的。便可以控制住國際最大市場。在十六世紀。列强所爭的。是通達印度的海道。在二十世紀。列强所角逐着的。都是通遠東廣大市塲的航空綫。中國是各國最所垂涎的寶藏。四萬萬的人民。偉大的地下富源。他的經濟前途。無可限量。航空是目前運輸與交通的最速工具。凡是鐵道汽船。都瞠乎其後。所以最進步的資本主義國家。如英如美如德。都傾全國的力量。以政府之財力。來開闢東方航空綫。美國之汎美公司。英國的帝國航空公司。均其明例。最近。德國擬建造齊泊林飛船多艘。自柏林通荷領東印度各埠。雖有興登堡大飛船在美之失事。曾未足以稍抑德國當局之雄圖。飛船之速度。比飛機高載重的能力。比飛機大。所以我們雖然屢屢聽到大飛船失事消息。而龐大的空中怪物。却旋滅而旋生。旋仆而旋起。</p>
<p>美國特别注意太平洋的航空。還有軍事上的意義。因爲美國一旦在遠東用兵。艦隊遠離根據地而作戰。在地利上。遠遜於牠的理想敵人。一方面。牠需要多量的空中利器。來轟炸敵國的軍事政治及經濟重心。一方面。他需要迅速的交通工具。做艦隊與艦隊間。及艦隊與根據地間之聯絡。飛機固然可以轟炸敵人。傳達情報。可是飛機不能負運輸之責。而前方作戰。後方運輸接濟源源不斷。是制勝的必要條件。所以海軍當局。雖建有大量飛機。終以飛船缺乏為可慮。數年以前。美國海軍所有的兩艘巨型飛船。卽亞克隆號與麥空號。相繼覆沒。現在美國齊泊林公司提議建造商用飛船。當然使海軍部感到深長的興趣。</p>
<p>因為經濟與軍事上的原因。自然會發生了政治上的結果。美國為求資本主義生命之維持。對於遠東市場。决不願任人霸佔瓜分。美國因為保衛本國及其海外利益之安全。對於軍事上之各種優勢。决不願放棄。所以他對於遠東政治之關心。因為交通之發達及商務之增加而日益加劇。由舊金山到香港。因飛機之應用。航程由二十天縮到六天。大飛船計劃成功。太平洋距離。又由六天縮到四天。遠東的一切。藉飛機飛船。而迫近於美國之眼前。他要對遠東政治作袖手旁觀。取不干涉態度。事實上更不可能。誰控制住太平洋優勢。誰便成為世界的盟主。目前美國正積極努力爭取太平洋之王座。而我們由美國大飛船計劃。可以看出所謂孤立主義中立政策。不過是迂闊之論。太平洋一日有事。美國必是最重要的角色。</p>

<h3>國防錢上（十）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>㊅閻百川先生答三問　　去年的緩遠抗戰，是中華民族復興史上，劃時代的一戰，這已成舉世的定評了。那時候，在後方，有全國廣大的民衆，作為後盾；在上面，有中央各當局作為重心；而在綫，實際英勇戰鬥的呢，却是我們全國所敬愛的許多萬的武裝同胞，以及身負指揮之責的各位將領•記者於這戰後不久的時候，來到了山西，對於當時力主“守土抗戰”，而且毀家抒難的晉綏最高當局的閻百川先生，當然，是懷着十二分的景仰之心的．——這是記者這次在太原晋見閻先生的第一層意思；表示敬意。</p>
<p>不過，自從去年年底綏戰告了一個段落，接着，西安事變發生以來，這幾個月內，前綫上，表面是比較人了沉寂的狀態。全國人對於國防前綫的注意點，就也跟着換了一個角度；由軍事的行動上，移到國防的準備上去了。於是，對基礎最鞏固，準備最積極的山西，由記者想來，大家的注意點，一定是落在這三個題目上的：㊀對於國防的最高指導原理，是什麼呢？㊁作為總動員預備階段的民衆組織和訓練，是什麼一種狀態呢？㊂物力的準備，到了什麼程度了，這種種設施詳細內容的報道，對全國人，是非常必要的；但尤其必要的，還是傾聽一下主持這一切的，最高當局的，對這些方面的襟懷和抱負。——這，是記者晋閻先生的第二層意思。</p>
<p>不過，為了使讀者們便於了解閻先生和記者談話裏所用的名詞含義起見，先簡括地說明一下，對於上述的第一點，山西當局的最高指導原理，就是所謂“踢破經常範圍，加緊自强”，而辦法、就是“加大預算”；在什麼社會條件下，才可以達到目的呢？於是，就有了“按勞分配”和“物產證券”的兩種主張。這些，是一貫而來的，有體系的理論。對於第二，第三兩點，最令全國人注意的：前者，是“主張公道團”，“犧牲救國同盟會”等等的組織，和當局所提倡的種種民衆運動；後者，是由西近些年來的種種工商的建設。</p>
<p>時間，是本年四月五號上午十點鐘左右，地點在太原的綏靖公署主任會客廳，晋绥最高當局的閻百川先生，接見了記者；陪同在座的，還有記者的一位朋友。</p>
<p>記者首先開口，向閻先生表示敬意。接着，閻先生就提到不久以前，“綏遠挺戰陣亡軍民追悼大會”舉行時，新聞界同人們的熱烈，而表示了稱讚和感謝。於是，託者就把下面這三個問題，逐一地提了出去，請求解答；他用着非常和藹誠懇的態度，一一地詳細解答了。在當時，並沒有用筆記下詞句來，現在這裏的記錄呢，也沒有機會能請閻先生校看一遍；所以下面所記，是出於記者的事後筆錄。大體意思，想不至有甚大出入，為集中讀者們印象起見，仍用一問一答的方式，記在下面。其詞句的配置，是完全出於記者的。——在這裏，應當首先聲明一下。</p>
<p>記者問：“閻先生的踢破經常範圍，加緊自强”的計劃，“加大預算”的辦法，以及“按勞分配”“物產證券”的主張，是已經一一拜讀過了；處處有科學的切實根據，眞是拜服之至！不過看起來，以目前情形而論，要想放到全國範圍上去行，似不免有相當困難的。廳外面傳說，貴省已經打算先試行一下了。那未，照閻先生尊意，是否預備並是否可以先就貴省試行一下呢”？</p>
<p>“不能的！”閻先生斷然地答。“你提到的“按勞分配”和“物產證券”，祇是我個人的兩種主張。這兩種主張的能否施行，這就要靠全國人士大家的研究了。我為什麼提出這兩種主張呢？主要的目的，還是在於富國强兵。因為，我們中國，受了近二千年來馬馬虎虎不負責任的流弊，比起列强來，國勢落後，眞不知有好多遠，現在我們要挽救危亡，最緊要的，當然是迎頭趕上人家。不過，在我們追趕的同時，人家進步的速度，比我們要快得多，所以要用經常的方法，我們恐怕會永遠落在後頭的。所以我提出一踢破經常範圍，加緊自强。”的口號。如何可以達到這個目的呢？於是，我就提出“加大預算”的辦法。同時，據我研究，現在世界上所有的列强，不過有兩種經濟制度；一是美日等國代表的資本主義社會；另一是蘇聯代表的社會主義社會。前者，牠的國家預算增加之可能限度，十年內，頂多是四倍。像美國，一九二六年度的預算，是三十五萬萬美金，而到了今年一九三六年度，就加到七十六萬萬美金；日本呢，一九二六年度是十五萬萬日金，而今年，就約到三十萬萬日金了。一個十年內增加了二倍多；一個十年內增加了一倍不到。可是社會主義的國家，牠的預算，十年內增加的可能限度，可以到十七倍。比如蘇聯，一九二六年度，牠的預算，是五十一萬萬盧布，一九三六年度，就到了七百八十萬萬盧布，而一九三七年度，就可以到九百八十萬萬盧布，十年內，一共增加了十七倍不到。這些，和我研究的估計，完全相合。我們的國家，如果走資本主義國家的路子，趕美日等列强，已經困難；縱使走社會主義的路子，而趕起蘇聯來，也難以趕得上的。於是，我另外研究一種能够趕上列强的路子，這就是你剛剛提到的“按勞分配”和“物產證券”。在這兩種制度下，國家的預算，十年內可以增到五十五倍多。我想起來，不如此，是難躋國家於富强之列的。近來，國人大都談論迎頭趕上去的辦法，我這些，也不過是我提出的辦法而已。又，還有一點，就是近來的人，研究國家的富强，往往祇注意美日等國，而忽略了蘇聯•××是我們當前的大敵，然而想到將來，對蘇聯，我們也應當加以注意。</p>

<h3>揚子江航業競爭</h3>
<p>公司挽救湖南綫　運川水脚分期跌减</p>
<p>本年航業趨勢、已從長江轉入沿海、故南洋營業、邇來非常發達、貨多船少、噸位缺乏、滬上之船舶噸價又告飛漲、每噸增至十先令、合諸國幣、約計八元五角、去年此時、每噸租價祇二元五角、以今較昔約漲三倍有强、故太古•日淸•怡和•等五大輪公司、昨日又召集會議、討論再將水脚增加、除五一•六一•已加百分之十外、今决定七一、再漲百分之十、其漲價之運輸地點為上海到福州•汕頭•廈門•香港•廣東•烟台•靑島•威海衛•天津等埠、而長江方面、乃發生野旗輪之競航、减跌水脚使六公司受重大打擊、今正設法挽救以擊破此競航的勁敵、此事關係航界頗巨、茲分述如次、</p>
<p>抵禦滬湘競航</p>
<p>去歲湖南農田大熟米糧運出至金、農民之購買力大增、而上海之運湘貨、較往年增至六七倍、由是上海至長沙一路之航業、異常發達、六公司競派專航班江輪、叟載往來貨物、先時因湘江水枯難航、運費加增到百分之一百　十、迄至現在湘河水漲、滬湘航路暢通、積貨趕裝數額甚巨、六公司公議雜貸水脚、每噸收十五元、詎料有永泰公司者、忽租用永安、與神福號兩輪開行上海至漢口及長沙班、以與六公司競爭滬湘航業、因不受公攤之束縛、故將水脚减跌每噸祇收七元五角、較六公司僅及半額開航以後、六公司大受打擊、現在由六公司一再曾商、决定抵禦方策、先將永泰租用之泳安輸、由招商局名義、向該船東大振航業公司每月以六千餘元之租金承租、業告成功、第二船神福號、亦由六公司設法租下、使永泰無船行駛、則此項競航可無形消滅、聞泳安租約業由招商局鑒定、此船大致亦派人湖南航路行駛、神福號租賃辦法、刻正與船束怡隆洋行接洽中、從此長江一路不論上下游、不准有野旗輪之挿足矣、</p>
<p>四川航業銳落</p>
<p>在過去三年中、川河航業、可稱發達到最高峯、造成民國六年以後之最新紀鋒、專航此路之民生公司、在此三年中、每年盈利均在百餘萬元、而太古•怡和•日淸等、亦年各餘利數十萬元、此一路之上海去貨、以棉紗為最大宗、在一年前、運費最低時、棉紗每件祇收三元、每噸僅十二元、今羅每件漲到二十六元、每噸為一百零四元、兩月前、川河水淺、分三段航行時、每個運費曾到四十餘元、其他各貨、亦漲至百數十元、鋼鐵機器每噸更漲到二百餘元、在此極度發達之時、川中乃發生大旱災、占地至數十縣之廣、川民之購買力、一落千丈、現值漲水航路暢通之時、照例止當去貨最擁之際、乃以旱災之影響百貨均遭阻停、去路全無、滬上川帮、業已相牽止辦人宗貨件、行駛川河之各輪船、營業亦陡然銳落、因去貨之少、收入大减、民生公司、已有大部分船、調往宜昌、運載成渝路積存之材料入川、以咨調劑、連日太占•怡和•民生•日淸•三北•等六公司已會議多次、决將上海運川貨之水脚分期跌减第一期、將棉紗每噸跌八元、什貨亦跌去十元、此項辦法昨已實打、但有數公司、私自放盤而將棉紗水脚下跌至二十四元一噸者、但運價雖跌、仍無貨件裝載、第第三期更有續跌之勢、</p>

<h3>國際勞工公約之制定與實施續</h3>
<p>— 程海峯</p>
<p>會員國批准公約之後，卽須切實執行，如不頒布法令或條例以及其他方法使公約發生效力，該國之工入團體或僱主團體可向國際勞工局控訴。理事院卽可將告訴書通知被訴國政府，請其發表辦證書。若在相當期限以內，該國政府不交辯證書，或雖交而理由不充足時，理事院便可將告訴書與辯證書公佈，訴諸世界輿論之批評。又任何會員國，認為另一會員國未曾切實履行彼此所批准之公約時，有向國際勞工局提起控訴之權利。凡此類控訴，均交審查委員會辦理。</p>
<p>公約草案之制定，雖為國際勞工組織之中心工作，但吾人决不能謂國際勞工組織僅為一制定國際勞工立法之機關。目前之種種重大經濟與社會問題，均有待於國際勞工組織之注意與解决，處此轉變時代之世界，種種經濟勢力，實有從事調整之必要。而今各國所感覺切需者，為如何建立一新的經濟平衡制度，俾得消减目前之危機與不景氣，而使世界達於和平繁榮之境，然此問題包括極廣，所有國際貿易，公平競爭，貨物與勞力之交易，以及金融價值之國際調整等問題俱在其內。故新經濟平衡制度之建立，乃係一最大之國際問題，决非僅賴各國之單獨努力所可奏效。必須國際間有誠意之合作，方足以言恢復世界經濟之秩序，此種任務，非短期內所能完成，因國際的經濟復興並無捷徑之可圖也。年來世界情况，雖有昭蘇之象，失業工人逐漸减少，工人生活亦稍有改進，但欲達到恢復繁榮之期，尚有不少之改革事業亟待實行。而此種事業之實現，惟有根據民主主義之方式，以自由討論及自由思想或利害衝突所引起之公開締約等，方能完成。此種民主主義之方法，卽國際勞工組織所採用以協助新經濟與社會秩序之建設者也。過去所制定之公約草案及建議書，皆係根據客觀的需要，以民主主義的方式所制成者。其實行將使世界各國之勞工狀况得到永久與普遍之改善。勞工生活改善之後，世界和平與繁榮方能維持。是以國際勞工組織之努力於保工立法，並不限於勞工地位之改進而已，實以社會正義為根據，而建設普遍之國際和平為目的焉。</p>
<h3>梁桐芳自殺獲救後表示努力奮鬥</h3>
<p>並認此次自殺為錯誤</p>
<p>愛國志士梁桐芳、此次服毒自殺獲救後、各方頗為關懷均紛往勸慰、梁君昨特說明其自殺錯誤云、這次我的自殺、竟引起各方面的批評在許多批評中間包含了忠誠的關懷、嚴厲的譴責、和誠懇的勸慰、我除了十二萬分的絕對接受和感謝外、是沒有絲毫多辯的餘地、可是并為了許多朋友和各界先進們的關懷起見、很慚羞地在刦後餘生的今日吐露我的一切、我承認我是一個缺乏正在認識的人、在各方面情感是重於理智的、這次的自殺舉動當然是缺乏理智的結果、在我富初的意思為內心矛盾衝突到無以自解的時候、祇有自殺、也許可以根本斬斷我的痛舌、不能表白被誣蔑心跡的痛苦、然而事實告訴我、這種自殺是錯誤的、祇有加重我的罪惡、現在我是明自了、從今以後、我决不再自殺、我認清楚自殺不是唯一的辦法我要盡我刦後餘生的力量、好好地幹積極的救人的工作、我知道我的能力是細微而薄弱的但是我現在堅决地要活下去、我竭誠的立誓、我要活下去、今後我要排斥了消極的意念、决定在國貨方面努力、為了中華民族的前途、盡中華民族一份子的力量、希望各界的先進們、和熱誠的朋友們寬恕我的旣往、我純潔的心雖遭受到魔鬼爪的撕裂、但我知這在這黑暗的打擊、更要勇敢起來、回復我原有的面目、這裏至誠地希望各界先進們和朋友們、給予嚴厲的督責我願意虔敬地接受一切批判和指示、同時我抱着慚愧的心敬致無限的謝忱、對於各界先進和關懷我的朋友們、</p>

<h3>繭行</h3>
<p>— 魯平</p>
<p>“大豐鮮繭行准於六月一日開秤”。</p>
<p>錢上這幾天來顯然是鬧熱了，就是幾家茶館和點心店，也比平日活潑了許多。</p>
<p>“繭行開秤了”！</p>
<p>“哦，繭行開秤了，有繭子賣的人家是多開心呀”！</p>
<p>“今年蠶汛不熟，繭價恐怕要貴點了吧”！</p>
<p>“桑葉價錢太貴了，今年繭子賣不上五十洋是要虧本的”。</p>
<p>近來，在街頭，在巷角，不論男女老少，只要一碰頭，誰都會互相地談到了那個問題上去。可是，有繭子賣的人在快樂，沒有繭子賣的却在嘆息，甚至，有些女人為了養蠶賠本，半年生活落了空而在哭泣着。</p>
<p>市梢上那一列白堊的牆壁，已經經過了一翻粉刷和修葺，“大豐繭行”四個擘窠大字，就分外來得有精神；那扇木柵門已敞開了，門前除原有的一個廊棚外，又臨時搭了二十來丈的一個蘆蓆篷，一直伸展到了小河浜邊，里進的繭房早已收拾清楚，烘繭間里的烘灶也全佈置得端端正正，那些“當方土地”也在那里出出進進地，十分忙碌。</p>
<p>外面的廊柱上，像神廟里的對聯似的貼着一雙宮簿皮一概不收”那一類老套。</p>
<p>六月一日的大淸早，大豐繭行門前已擠滿了一擔擔的繭子，河浜里也有好多艘裝着繭子的小船。</p>
<p>八點敲過了，還不見開秤，從木柵門里望進去，里面靜悄悄地，只有幾個伕役在安排着扛籃和－切應用的東西。</p>
<p>“到現在還不開秤呢，正是繭行老爺”！</p>
<p>到了九點鐘，兩個秤手才出來在高凳上一坐，大家馬上搶着把繭子筐送上去，伕役們接過來倒在那隻特製的大扛籃里，由那位“看牌”先生把繭子從上到下的翻－回，再撈起幾佪來用兩個指頭捏捏看，纔讓伕役掛到秤钩上去。秤手們却眼睛眇着秤梢，手檔着秤錘，機械地報告着斤兩和價錢。</p>
<p>“三十斤，十二元”。</p>
<p>“先生，十二塊錢不够的”。</p>
<p>“多少，這又沒討價還價的”！</p>
<p>“再加點”！</p>
<p>“噢！十二元二角……”</p>
<p>“不賣的，至少十五元”！</p>
<p>“倒回去，倒回去”！</p>
<p>於是，秤手先生又去秤別隻扛藍了，那個鄉下人只得把那隻扛藍拖了過來，將給翻癟了的繭子，仍舊倒回了自己籃里！懊喪地挑着，咕噥着走出了繭行門。</p>
<p>“騙鬼，五十洋一擔，三十斤挺硬</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>的繭子十四塊錢也賣不滿，他們這些大</p>
<p>老虫只曉得刮鄉下人，人家桑葉不要錢</p>
<p>買的。咳，不上五十洋不賣，情願回去</p>
<p>抽絲”。</p>
<p>但是當着一個賣繭女人從人叢里擠</p>
<p>出來的時侯，不知是誰在那里切切私語</p>
<p>：</p>
<p>”嗨！倒底要交情，阿寶娘子二十</p>
<p>五斤薄衣頭繭子也賈了十五隻洋呢”！</p>
<p>“誰呌你也不去拜一個做繭行秤手</p>
<p>的乾兒子的啊”！</p>
<p>外面依舊是擠着人頭，繭子筐忙亂</p>
<p>地從欄杆上遞進去空筐和聯票由欄杆上</p>
<p>送出來，繭子給扛夫扛進了繭房里去，</p>
<p>聯票到小窗里去換了法幣，於是鄉下人</p>
<p>看着法幣想：還債，贖當，剩餘下來的</p>
<p>可做種田本錢。繭行老闆也看着繭子在</p>
<p>想：今天的情形每百斤乾繭可穩賺十元</p>
<p>，要是下半天貨色再是那樣擁擠的話，</p>
<p>還可抑低五塊錢一擔，假定這一市里能</p>
<p>够收到二千擔，那末一二萬塊錢是風吹不</p>
<p>去，雨打不掉了。</p>
<p>到了十二點鐘，里面喊着：“停秤</p>
<p>了，下半天再來”！便把那扇木柵門關</p>
<p>上了。</p>
<p>可是，下午却跌落了五元一百斤的</p>
<p>繭價。</p>
<h3>捕魚船</h3>
<p>— 郭卞</p>
<p>西沉的太陽佩着雲霞向萬石山背後隱藏，山頭的積雪發出晶光，彷彿拚力抵抗陽光的暴力。海江已經蔓延到枯寂的樹林中，赤裸裸的枝幹不住氣的搖擺着。村落起了噪囂，牲口呌號，“呌馬車”尖聲的響着，孩子哭的哭，吵的吵。一切都不平靜，每天都是這樣！祇有“關帝廟”前的一對高入天空的白銀頂太旗杆，靜穆穆的矗立着。人們一刻不停的工作着，搓稻草繩，補漁網，編蓆子，結預備秋初打海𧎴用的草繩網，就連小孩子也不得閒着玩兒，大人給他們些魚干子或晒乾的“蝦仁”，呌他們揀選，好的壞的分開。</p>
<p>不等太陽落山，就吃了晚飯，漁夫們就出船打漁去了。常船隻像蛾蝶似的在無邊的海面上行進，山岬間的“燈塔”便開始放光了。篷帆被風吹着，跟懷孕的女人的肚皮似的，他們喊呌着，並非是驚駭浪滔的汹湧，乃是習慣了的生活，他們一工作起來總帶着喊呌，這跟打椿的工人必須唱歌是一樣的道理。</p>
<p>達到目的地時，夜色已把海面吞沒了，他們發現了機器漁輸，機器聲淸淸楚楚的灌進耳鼓裏來。誰都驚異着，在“桑島”一帶從來沒有用機器船打漁的，靑鳥和威海有機器船捕魚，可是“桑島”不會有的。</p>
<p>一網一綱總是落空，魚都哪兒去了呢？遠處那機器魚輪開過來了，牠發狠的東跑西跑，魚全給牠嚇走了。在黑暗中，光憑着一點點漁火是看不出那機器漁輪的，他們沒可奈何就離開這兒，向着更遠的地方去。</p>
<p>動手工作時，那可恨的漁輸又追來了，大概牠是誠心要找別扭—漁夫們憤恨着，他們的漁船一齊上前去包圍那漁輪。</p>
<p>“誰家的漁船呀？”一個漁夫氣忿忿的問。</p>
<p>漁船上沒有回聲，管理機器的人一點也不理會他們。</p>
<p>“老子要你們這船走開，桑島海面不准用機器船打漁，聽見沒有？馬上走開！”</p>
<p>漁船上的回答是：</p>
<p>“我們是××的漁輪！”那個敢趕我們走開！”</p>
<p>一陣笑聲之後又跟着一句蠻橫的話</p>
<p>漁夫們個個垂頭喪氣的離開漁船，撑着自己的船往別處走，不惹他們躲他們好啦！</p>
<p>“踏着頭啦屎欺人太甚啦”！漁夫們剛開始工作，那漁輪又開來亂跑，攪得魚不上網。然他們自己的漁輪却滿網滿網的魚打上來。實在不能供人忍受這恥辱！忽然一個漁夫從後尾的艙中拿出了“快鎗”，他們平常都帶着鎗，防備海盜！一聲槍響，別的漁夫也都擔起自己的鎗向着那漁輪放！</p>
<p>勝利了！那漁輪飛一般的逃跑了！漁夫們愉快的工作着，直到天明。</p>
<p>第二天“桑島”海面上，又發現了××的機器漁輪，一隻，二隻，三隻，……七八隻掛着太陽標幟的。他們一見了中國漁民的漁船就開槍，開砲，“桑島”海面立成了戰塲！漁夫們退避了！他們在向着新的地方去開闢新的捕漁區！</p>
<p>桑島海面上天天都有××的大批機器漁輪捕漁，誰也不敢冒犯牠，漁民都敢怒而不敢言。談言。</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>儲力運動</h3>
<p>— 趙夢瀾</p>
<p>靑年會最近在舉辦一種“儲力運動”。這運動，據靑年會有一位幹事先生說：“這不過是一種提倡，實行與否，是要民衆自己去决定的。”所提倡的要儲的力，是分四類：自信自尊盡其全力協助國家之建設事業（心力）：每日體操一刻鐘體力）；有一技之長（智力）；及每日至少儲畜一分錢（物力）是也。關於“儲力運動”，靑年會規定以後經常要做的工作很多，開其端的，作為提倡的提倡的“儲力運動展覽會”，則在四日已經舉行過開幕典禮了。</p>
<p>“力”而要儲”，可見我們過去是把“力”浪費了的，“儲力”而要“提倡”，而且是成為一種“運動”，則更可見我們過去是在把“力”怎樣的在浪費着，或者，簡直是在摧殘力的生長。儲力展覽會開幕典禮中主席致詞有云：“故一國土地之大小，人民之多小，應與其國力之强弱為正比例，其有時不能成正比例，轉成反比例者，大約不外兩途：㊀為不能將國家整個的力量集中起來；㊁例如過去軍閥之自殘，將整個國家的力量，由於不必要之耗費”，這話是說得不錯。而我們的過去，恰好就是這“兩途”，尤其是後一途，就不知道造成過多少“人禍”，和人造的“天災”！</p>
<p>而一有天災人禍，逃命不遑，又那裏還有餘暇把力儲起來？兪代市長在“儲力與民族復興中說：“未有一民族終日從事其本身力量之戕伐，而能不滅不亡者，樹不折於暴風而毁於蛀蝕，其故可深長思”！這眞是“可深長思”者。</p>
<p>但除此之外，還有“可深長思”者。</p>
<p>記不起是那一位先生說的“有用的人才大都在牢獄中”。這句話如果要演釋一下，那麼就是“大約不外兩途”中的第一途“不能將國家整個的力量集中起來”，“不能將國家整個的力量集中起來”的根據，那在儲力運動展覽開幕時已經有人說過了，“國家整個力量潛伏於每個民衆身上，善用之則潛伏之力量可以表現出來，發揚出來；不善用之，則潛伏之力量，亦可以平白地蹧蹋掉，浪費掉，化為烏有。”而把“人才”（也就是優秀的力量）“儲”在牢裏，則也正是把潛伏之力量，平日地蹧蹋掉，浪費掉，化為烏有。</p>
<p>所以，“我們不要先自欣幸國家統一了，國力集中了，以為此後任何困難，俱可對付過去，還要注意到每個人身上，他們潛伏的力量，果能表現出來嗎？果能發揚出來嗎”？“使他們很好的力量，不致埋沒掉，浪費掉，那末把四萬五千萬人的力量，造成整個國家的力量，自然可以與世界大强國並駕各驅了。”</p>

<h3>Adoption of the Metric System for Automobile Odometers and Fuel Gauges – Implementation Measures</h3>
<p>Drafted by the Ministry of Industries, Promulgated for Implementation</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan, based on a report from the Ministry of Industries stating that the construction of urban roads and highways in our country has progressed rapidly in recent years, and the number of automobiles in use has increased significantly, while most odometers and fuel gauges installed in domestically used automobiles are measured in miles and U.S. gallons, respectively. As the new system is being universally promoted throughout the country, such non-compliant units of length and volume should not be allowed to persist. Moreover, since all national highways are measured in kilometers, the mile-based odometers are inconvenient for drivers. The adoption of the metric system should be gradually implemented to facilitate uniformity in national standards. The Ministry also drafted a set of measures for the implementation of the adoption of the metric system for automobile odometers and fuel gauges, along with a conversion table for automobile distance and fuel measurements between the metric and imperial systems. With the approval of the National Economic Council, it was recently passed by the Executive Yuan and promulgated for implementation. The original text of the implementation measures is as follows: ㊀ Automobile odometers shall measure distance in kilometers, and fuel gauges shall measure volume in liters. Six months after the promulgation of these measures, highway traffic authorities shall refuse to register any new automobiles whose odometers or fuel gauges still use the imperial system. ㊂ All signs indicating automobile speed limits in each province and city shall uniformly use kilometer markings. ㊂ Oil and fuel used in automobiles, whether packaged in barrels or cans, shall uniformly indicate the number of liters. ㊃ All fuel transactions and fuel dispensers at gas stations shall uniformly measure volume in liters. ㊄ Each province and city shall uniformly use the metric system for the registration of automobile distance and fuel volume. ㊅ When registering an automobile, a copy of these measures and a conversion table for distance and fuel measurements between the metric and imperial systems shall be provided, one for the car owner and one for the driver. ㊅ These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

<h3>Trans-Pacific Airship Plan</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Since the successful trans-Pacific clipper airplane flight between China and the United States, and the opening of regular air routes, American government and private sectors are keenly planning a trans-Pacific airship. According to the Shanghai Times of this month's 2nd, the American Zepplin Transport Company plans to build two large airships for regular trans-Pacific flights. The company has requested subsidies from the US Congress and will use American-produced helium instead of hydrogen. A Zepplin airship from San Francisco to Hong Kong would take only four days, shortening the Pacific Clipper flight time by two days. Each airship can carry seventy passengers each time. According to officials in the US Department of Commerce, this plan could be realized in two years at the latest.</p>
<p>The active American involvement in aviation development in the Pacific has great significance commercially, politically, and even militarily. Commercially speaking, in today's world of business competition, whoever controls the most important international air routes can control the largest international markets. In the sixteenth century, powers fought for sea routes to India. In the twentieth century, powers are competing for air routes to the vast markets of the Far East. China is a treasure trove coveted by all countries, with four hundred million people and vast underground resources. Its economic prospects are limitless. Aviation is the fastest means of transportation today, surpassing railways and steamships. Therefore, the most advanced capitalist countries, such as Britain, America, and Germany, are using national power and government funds to open up air routes to the East. The American Pan American Company and the British Imperial Airways are prime examples. Recently, Germany planned to build multiple Zepplin airships to connect Berlin with various ports in the Dutch East Indies. Despite the Hindenburg airship disaster in the United States, it did not diminish the ambitions of the German authorities. Airships have higher speed and greater carrying capacity than airplanes. Therefore, although we often hear news of airship accidents, the massive aerial monsters are quickly destroyed and then rebuilt, falling and rising again.</p>
<p>The United States pays special attention to aviation in the Pacific for military reasons. If the United States goes to war in the Far East, its fleet will be far from its base. Geographically, it is far inferior to its ideal enemy. On the one hand, it needs a large number of aerial weapons to bomb the enemy's military, political, and economic centers. On the other hand, it needs rapid transportation to connect fleets and connect the fleets with their bases. Airplanes can bomb the enemy and transmit information, but they cannot bear the responsibility of transportation. Continuous transportation from the rear is necessary for victory. Therefore, although the naval authorities have built a large number of aircraft, they are concerned about the lack of airships. Years ago, the US Navy's two giant airships, the Akron and the Macon, were destroyed one after another. Now, the American Zepplin Company's proposal to build commercial airships naturally interests the Navy Department deeply.</p>
<p>Economic and military reasons naturally lead to political consequences. To maintain its capitalist existence, the United States does not want to allow others to monopolize and divide the Far Eastern market. To protect its own security and its overseas interests, the United States does not want to give up any military advantages. Therefore, its concern for Far Eastern politics is intensifying due to the development of transportation and the increase in commerce. From San Francisco to Hong Kong, the journey has been shortened from twenty days to six days with the use of airplanes. If the airship plan succeeds, the distance across the Pacific will be reduced from six days to four days. Everything in the Far East is brought closer to the United States' eyes through airplanes and airships. It wants to remain aloof from Far Eastern politics and adopt a non-interference attitude, but it is practically impossible. Whoever controls the Pacific advantage will become the leader of the world. The United States is actively striving for the throne of the Pacific. We can see from the American airship plan that the so-called isolationist neutral policy is just a naive argument. If something happens in the Pacific, the United States will be the most important player.</p>

Kong recently told a Havas reporter, "I am very happy to have this opportunity to contact prominent French figures. I would like to publicly express my heartfelt gratitude for the sincere hospitality of the French government and people." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Qingyi Newspaper recently published a commentary praising Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Chinese Executive Yuan, saying, "It is an undeniable fact that China's finances and economy are thriving, and Dr. Kong is the most important leader in this regard. Dr. Kong is the 75th generation descendant of the sage Confucius, and his life's work is to promote China's construction and modernization. The recent reorganization of the Central Bank and the implementation of the legal tender policy are particularly noteworthy. Furthermore, in terms of China's foreign relations, if China wants to establish its prestige and credit abroad, it must ensure that all of China's foreign debts are repaid on time with principal and interest. During his tenure as Minister of Finance, Kong was able to repay all foreign debt principal and interest when due. Therefore, all foreigners are happy to provide China with capital assistance. This is naturally dependent on foreign capital assistance when China's own domestic capital strength is not yet sufficient." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Air Battle During the Burial of Mola</h3>

<h3>Deceased Oil Tycoon's Estate Worth 25 Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>Income Tax Approximately 19 Million US Dollars</p>
<p>⊙White Plains, USA The method of disposal of the entire estate of the late oil tycoon Rockefeller, worth 25 million US dollars, has been announced today. In the third codicil to his will in October 1943, all the income from the estate will be inherited by his niece, Margaret. According to Margaret, the least known of Rockefeller's clan, is the Marchioness of Guevara of Spain and has two children. Today's announcement of the will is surprising. However, in the codicil, Rockefeller also stated that he had long provided for other descendants. The estate is now managed by the trustee, and the income is received by Margaret or her descendants or the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. If the total value of the estate is indeed 25 million US dollars, the federal government will receive more than 15 million US dollars in inheritance tax, and the New York state government will receive more than 4 million US dollars. The trustee will be able to manage only more than 5.5 million US dollars. (National News Agency dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<h3>Germany and Italy's Reply to England on the Spanish Question</h3>
<p>Oppose Prior Consultation Among the Four Countries, Still Cooperate to Ensure Safety</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to well-informed sources, the German government sent a reply to the British government today regarding the security of surveillance ships. The content can be divided into the following points: ㊀ Germany unreservedly supports the establishment of a safe zone. ㊁ Germany acknowledges that the safety of surveillance ships should be guaranteed by both sides of the Spanish Civil War. The British government can request the Spanish Nationalist government to guarantee not to attack warships of various countries engaged in surveillance work, but Germany cannot fully trust the guarantee provided by the "Valencia Red Committee." ㊂ If a surveillance ship is attacked, Germany believes that the existing system where the commanders of the naval fleets of England, France, Germany, and Italy stationed in Spanish waters must conduct consultations is insufficient, and this consultation process is inevitably too slow. Therefore, Germany advocates that if any participating surveillance warship is attacked for violating international law, it should be allowed to take legitimate self-defense measures on its own. The fleet commanders of each country may take retaliatory measures on their own. In addition, the German reply repeatedly stated that Germany hopes to resume the surveillance work of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War and resolve the bombing incident of the Deutschland. It is reported that before Germany issued this note, it had obtained the consent of the Italian government in advance. Political figures believe that Germany's opinion is nothing more than to establish a relationship of joint consistency among the countries participating in surveillance, and hope that the British government can fully understand this. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The content of the German reply on the British proposal is quite optimistic. The British side seems to be studying the reply and then conducting negotiations. However, the Soviet Union's opposition has a significant influence on France, and there still seems to be obstacles in the future. (National Seafarer's Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Foreign Minister Count Ciano met with the British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, this morning, and stated the views on guaranteeing the safety of warships participating in surveillance in Spanish waters. This statement is the Italian government's reply. According to well-informed sources, the content of the Italian reply is completely consistent with the reply sent by the German government yesterday. According to responsible persons, Ciano told Drummond that Italy was very pleased to hear that England suggested limiting participation in naval surveillance to England, France, Germany, and Italy. This should be put on record. However, Italy opposes the British suggestion that the fleet commanders of the participating surveillance countries should consult each other before taking retaliatory action in the event of an incident. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 5th) ⊙Valencia, Spain Since receiving the request from the Non-Intervention Committee to uphold humanitarian principles in the civil war, the Minister of the Army sent a reply to the committee today, implying that the Spanish government has the right to retaliate. The reply stated, "Regarding the horrors of aerial warfare, the only way to follow is to deal with the enemy with equal or more severe methods. This is a method of fighting poison with poison and terror with terror." (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 6th)</p>

It is reported that Hitler and Papen will discuss the recent war of words in the German and Austrian newspapers and the speech delivered yesterday by the Archbishop of Vienna, Theodor Innitzer. Archbishop Innitzer's speech stated that the anti-religious movement promoted by Germany is detrimental to the reputation of the German nation.

He said that the German Air Defense Association now has 12 million members, 5,000 branches, 800,000 staff members, 2,400 air defense instructors, 5 million organized technicians, and 3,400 air defense schools. Millions of gas masks for general civilian use have been manufactured and are being sold on the market. Staff members of the Air Defense Association conduct regular drills on the use of gas masks. Göring continued by mentioning the bombing of the German cruiser "Deutschland," saying, "In the past, Germany could be intimidated and succumb, but now that is not the case. Germany can now be in charge of its own affairs. If Germans are subjected to bloodshed, it cannot be compensated with ink, but should be repaid with cannons." In addition, Göring also said that if a war breaks out, men should serve on the battlefield, and women should be responsible for air defense in the rear. "Our German ancestors, thousands of years ago, defended the homeland and resisted Rome, and were known for their heroism throughout the world. Today, we should also emulate the spirit of our ancestors. After the men sacrifice themselves, the women should continue to fight. Not only should German men not act like weak women, but women should also have the spirit of courageously killing the enemy." (Central News Agency, Havas, 5th)</p>

<h3>National Defense Funds (10)</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Shu Di</p>
<p>(5) Mr. Yan Xishan Answers Three Questions: The defensive war of resistance in Suiyuan last year was an epoch-making battle in the history of the Chinese nation's revival. This has become a universally accepted assessment. At that time, in the rear, there was a vast national populace as the backing; at the top, there were various central authorities as the focus; and on the line, the actual heroic fighters were the tens of thousands of armed compatriots and the generals responsible for command whom our entire nation respects. Shortly after this war, I came to Shanxi. Naturally, I held Mr. Yan Xishan, the highest authority of Jin-Sui who strongly advocated "defending the territory and resisting the enemy" and sacrificed his family to relieve the nation's difficulties, in the highest esteem. This was my first intention in meeting Mr. Yan in Taiyuan this time: to express my respect.</p>
<p>However, since the Suiyuan war came to a close at the end of last year, followed by the Xi'an Incident, the front lines have been relatively quiet for the past few months. The focus of the national attention on the national defense front lines has also shifted: from military action to national defense preparation. Therefore, regarding Shanxi, which has the most solid foundation and the most active preparations, I believe that everyone's attention must be focused on these three questions: (1) What is the highest guiding principle for national defense? (2) What is the state of the popular organization and training as a preparatory stage for general mobilization? (3) To what extent has the preparation of material resources reached? Detailed reports on these various facilities are very necessary for the people of the whole country, but what is especially necessary is to listen to the sentiments and ambitions of the highest authorities in charge of all this in these areas. This was my second intention in meeting Mr. Yan.</p>
<p>However, in order to make it easier for readers to understand the meaning of the terms used in Mr. Yan's conversation with me, I will first briefly explain that the highest guiding principle of the Shanxi authorities for the first point mentioned above is the so-called "breaking through the regular scope and accelerating self-strengthening," and the method is to "increase the budget." Under what social conditions can the goal be achieved? Therefore, there are two proposals: "distribution according to labor" and "property securities." These are consistent and systematic theories. For the second and third points, what attracts the most attention of the people of the whole country are: the former is the organizations such as the "Advocating Justice Corps" and the "Sacrifice to Save the Nation Alliance," and the various popular movements advocated by the authorities; the latter is the various industrial and commercial constructions in recent years.</p>
<p>The time was around 10 a.m. on April 5 of this year, and the location was the reception room of the Director of the Pacification Headquarters in Taiyuan. Mr. Yan Xishan, the highest authority of Jin-Sui, met with me. A friend of mine was also present.</p>
<p>I first expressed my respect to Mr. Yan. Then, Mr. Yan mentioned the enthusiasm of the people in the press at the "Suiyuan War of Resistance Martyrs Commemoration Conference" held not long ago and expressed his praise and gratitude. Then, I presented the following three questions one by one and asked for answers. He answered each of them in detail with a very kind and sincere attitude. I did not take notes on the words and sentences at the time, and I have not had the opportunity to ask Mr. Yan to review the records here; therefore, what is recorded below is from my post-event notes. I believe that the general meaning is not greatly different. In order to focus the impressions of the readers, I will still record it in a question-and-answer format below. The arrangement of the words and sentences is entirely from me. This should be stated first.</p>
<p>I asked: "I have already read Mr. Yan's plan to 'break through the regular scope and accelerate self-strengthening,' the method of 'increasing the budget,' and the proposals of 'distribution according to labor' and 'property securities.' Everywhere there is a scientific and practical basis, and I am truly impressed! However, it seems that, judging from the current situation, it may be quite difficult to implement it on a national scale. It is rumored outside that your province has already planned to try it out first. Then, according to Mr. Yan's intention, are you prepared and is it possible to try it out first in your province?"</p>
<p>"No!" Mr. Yan answered decisively. "The 'distribution according to labor' and 'property securities' that you mentioned are just my personal proposals. Whether these two proposals can be implemented depends on the research of everyone in the country. Why did I propose these two proposals? The main purpose is still to enrich the country and strengthen the army. Because our China has suffered from the malpractice of being careless and irresponsible for nearly two thousand years. Compared with the great powers, the national strength is far behind. Now, to save the country from danger, the most important thing is to catch up with others. However, while we are catching up, the speed of others' progress is much faster than ours. Therefore, if we use regular methods, I am afraid that we will always be left behind. That is why I proposed the slogan of 'breaking through the regular scope and accelerating self-strengthening.' How can this goal be achieved? Therefore, I proposed the method of 'increasing the budget.' At the same time, according to my research, all the great powers in the world today have only two economic systems: one is the capitalist society represented by the United States, Japan, and other countries; the other is the socialist society represented by the Soviet Union. For the former, the possible limit for increasing the national budget is at most four times in ten years. For example, the budget of the United States in 1926 was 35 billion US dollars, and in 1936, it increased to 76 billion US dollars; for Japan, the budget in 1926 was 15 billion Japanese yen, and this year, it is about 30 billion Japanese yen. One increased by more than two times in ten years; the other increased by less than one time in ten years. However, for socialist countries, the possible limit for increasing the budget in ten years can reach seventeen times. For example, the Soviet Union, in 1926, its budget was 5.1 billion rubles, and in 1936, it reached 78 billion rubles, and in 1937, it can reach 98 billion rubles, an increase of seventeen times in ten years. These are completely in line with my research and estimates. If our country takes the path of capitalist countries, it will be difficult to catch up with the United States, Japan, and other great powers; even if we take the path of socialism, it will be difficult to catch up with the Soviet Union. Therefore, I have researched another way to catch up with the great powers, which is the 'distribution according to labor' and 'property securities' that you just mentioned. Under these two systems, the national budget can be increased by more than 55 times in ten years. I think that without doing so, it is difficult to elevate the country to the ranks of wealth and strength. Recently, most people in the country are talking about ways to catch up, and these are just my proposals. Also, there is one more point, that is, recently people have been researching the wealth and strength of the country, often only paying attention to the United States, Japan, and other countries, while neglecting the Soviet Union. ×× is our current great enemy, but thinking about the future, we should also pay attention to the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Yang Yongtai Assassination Case: Court Holds Collegial Panel Hearing</h3>
<p>Minister Jiang was shot at last year. Prosecutor investigates as an ancillary matter. The case has concluded its debates and will be pronounced after deliberations.</p>
<p>Hankou Aviation News. The Criminal Division of the Wuchang District Court held a collegial panel hearing at 9:00 AM on the 4th to publicly try the Yang Yongtai assassination case. Military police were stationed inside and outside the court as before. From 7:00 AM, those requesting to attend the hearing arrived in droves. Many additional seats were temporarily added to the audience area. At 9:05 AM, Criminal Division Chief Liu Xianji, alongside judges Wang Zhaoji and Yue Shutang, prosecutor Zhu Chengzan, and clerk Shi Gujing, took their seats in the first courtroom. All representatives of the plaintiff, the Yang Yongtai family, their private attorney Xie Shengkan, the defense attorneys selected by the defendant Liu Luyin, Wang Zhaoxiang, Zhang Guoen, and Gong Bozhou, the defense attorney selected by Yang Qixin, Zhou Qiyou, the defense attorney selected by Wen Maoguan, Geng Yigong, the defense attorneys selected by Nie Jingquan, Chen Bangben and Yin Shaoliang, and the court-appointed attorney for Cheng Xiechao, Hu Sijiang, and the attorneys for Cao Bingrong and Li Qunjian, Xiao Buyun, also arrived on time and took their seats in the attorneys' area. At 9:15 AM, Judge Liu Xianji ordered the defendants Liu Luyin, Cheng Xiechao, Gong Bozhou, Yang Qixin, Cao Bingrong, Li Qunjian, Nie Jingquan, and Wen Maoguan to be brought to the court and seated in the defendant's area. Liu Luyin was still wearing his old flannel suit and appeared sickly due to the oppressive and hot weather. Cheng Xiechao was still wearing his grass-green military uniform with shackles on his feet. After someone ordered him to remove his military uniform, he also sat in the defendant's area. Judge Liu then questioned Liu Luyin and the other eight defendants about their names, ages, native places, addresses, family situations, education levels, and property amounts. He then asked prosecutor Zhu Chengzan to explain the gist of the indictment, briefly explaining the criminal acts of the defendants Liu Luyin and the other eight, and stated that he was now ordered by the High Prosecutor's Office to also conduct an ancillary investigation into the shooting of Minister Jiang's car in Beijing on October 10th of last year. Judge Liu then held a public trial. According to Liu Luyin's statement, he had not only not committed the crime of inciting murder in the Yang Yongtai case, but he had never even dreamed of such a thing. He said that he had followed the Premier in the revolution for many years, and his work had always been in the field of writing and had never held actual political responsibility. He had always been indifferent to fame and fortune, which is why he was willing to sacrifice his positions as Minister of Propaganda and Vice President of the Examination Yuan to travel south and work for the unity of the Party and the country. Since he was indifferent to fame and fortune, there was no question of him competing with others for power and profit. He had been in the Party for more than 20 years, and although he had not achieved anything, he had always loved the Kuomintang and believed in the Central Government, especially in Chairman Jiang, whom he loved and believed in even more. After the Xi'an Incident last year, he was very worried about Chairman Jiang's safety. He did not advocate military conquest and published a speech in the Hong Kong newspapers. As for his friendship with Yang Yongtai, if Yang's family had financial difficulties, he could find ways to help them out of personal friendship, but he was not legally obligated to do so. From the above, he proved that he had nothing to do with the Yang Yongtai assassination case and that his love for Chairman Jiang was genuine because Chairman Jiang was a follower of the Premier and an important person responsible for the Central Government, proving that he had never participated in the work of investigating Chairman Jiang's whereabouts. At this point, Liu Luyin declared to the court that he would ask attorneys Wang Zhaoxiang and Zhang Guoen to defend him on legal matters because he was a little sick and would leave the court first.</p>
<p>Next, according to Cheng Xiechao's confession, he joined the assassination organization in April of last year. When he assassinated Yang Yongtai on October 25th, he fired two shots. Gong Bozhou was also present at the time of the assassination and also took a gun and fired. He also met Cao Bingrong in front of the People's Office and nodded slightly, but he did not know whether Cao Bingrong participated. The court took out the pistol used in the assassination from the stolen goods warehouse and asked Cheng Xiechao, "Is this the gun you used in the assassination?" Cheng replied, "Yes, it is."</p>
<p>Next, according to Gong Bozhou's confession, he did not know about the assassination organization. He only came to Hankou to ask Yang Xiaoming for money. He did not buy a pistol in Nanjing. Yang Xiaoming gave him 70 yuan in Shanghai, of which 10 yuan was used to buy a "Dong Piao" ticket. He took the money and returned to Nanjing to recuperate. In May of last year, he went to Xingzi County with Yang Qixin to see a friend, but he did not go to Lushan to investigate Chairman Jiang's whereabouts because he caught a cold on the road and became ill when he arrived in Xingzi County. He did go to Wutaishan Village Park in Nanjing. He refused to admit to the assassination of Yang Yongtai. Yang Xiaoming showed him a photo of Yang Yongtai in a room in the Nanjing Hotel with Fan Qishu and Liang Jiubao. If Cheng Xiechao's statement about assassinating Yang Yongtai was true and he was present and fired a gun, how could no one have seen it at the time? He also did not know about the shooting of Minister Jiang's car in Beijing on October 10th of last year. When Gong Bozhou confessed, he spoke hesitantly and unclearly, and he repeatedly quibbled with his previous confessions, which caused the judges a great deal of trouble.</p>
<p>Next, Cao Bingrong, Yang Qixin, Li Qunjian, Nie Jingquan, and Wen Maoguan were questioned, and their confessions were the same as those given to the investigation court. They all stated that they did not know about the shooting of Minister Jiang's car in Beijing on October 10th of last year. However, after Li Qunjian finished his confession, he burst into tears and submitted a written defense to the court. After finishing his confession, he also claimed to be ill and requested to leave the court, leaving his attorney to defend him.</p>
<p>At this point, the attorneys for each defendant were ordered to stand up and defend their clients in turn. ⑴ Wang Zhaoxiang, the attorney selected by Liu Luyin, stated that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the defendant Liu Luyin had committed a crime. The purpose of the special agent plan approved by Liu was to eliminate traitors and had nothing to do with the Yang case. The doctrine referred to in the plan was of course the Three Principles of the People. The doctrine of training members was to train members in the eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, loyalty, righteousness, harmony, and peace, and there was absolutely no implication of assassination. Furthermore, the words "Approve two thousand yuan per month to be remitted by Ru Yun" had no implication of inciting murder. At that time, Liu Luyin was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the People's Sports Association. Liu did not affix his seal or signature after the approval, nor did he indicate the date, which shows that the approval was based on someone else's dictation. Moreover, five or six days later, he went to Shanghai to work with Mr. Wang Liangchou on Party unity. The eleven words in the approval cannot be used as evidence of the crime of inciting murder. Secondly, Neng Lu's written confession was not made just once, and each time the written confession contained the statement that he was dispatched by someone to discuss the matter, which shows that his will was not free. Since Xiao Ruoxu had no suspicion of participating in the assassination, the prosecutor had already given a disposition of non-prosecution. Even if there was an assassination group, Xiao Ruoxu did not participate, so how could he know that there was an assassination organization? Moreover, Xiao Ruoxu had already made a report in the investigation court and repeatedly stated that his written confession was written under duress and in a state of unfreedom due to fear of being tortured. If Liu Luyin was added to the Standing Committee of the People's Sports Association because he was deemed to be disrupting order, then it would be even more arbitrary to say that the organization of the People's Sports Association was in accordance with the Premier's will and intended to awaken the people. The special agent team was directly controlled by the People's Sports Committee and indirectly controlled by the Kuomintang, and it could not be concluded that it was a society whose purpose was to commit crimes. Therefore, this point cannot be established. Furthermore, the crime of preparing to incite murder is the crime of creation. Now, the special agent team was not created by Liu Luyin, but was an inherent organization. Cheng Xiechao's assassination of former Chairman Yang had no relationship with the special agent team at all. Moreover, the other one thousand criminals were not members of the special agent team, and Liu Luyin had absolutely no intention of assassinating Yang, which does not meet the standards of the crime of creation. Therefore, the court should declare Liu Luyin innocent and reject the private prosecution of the family of former Chairman Yang. Secondly, Zhang Guoen, the attorney selected by Liu, also stood up and defended his client, explaining that Liu Luyin had nothing to do with the Yang case. ⑵ Hu Sijiang, the attorney appointed by the court, stood up to defend Cheng Xiechao, saying that Cheng Xiechao's motive and purpose for committing the crime stemmed from a mistaken patriotic idea, and asked the court to reduce the sentence. ⑶ Lin Hengyuan, the attorney selected by Gong Bozhou, stood up and said that Gong Bozhou denied buying a pistol. Gong and Yang Xiaoming were relatives and borrowed money.</p>
<p>Although Gong had been to Xingzi County, he did not go to Lushan to investigate Chairman Jiang's whereabouts. Going to Wutaishan Village Park in Nanjing was also a purely recreational activity. Gong did not assassinate at the same time as Cheng Xiechao because Cheng Xiechao fired two shots, and former Chairman Yang only suffered two gunshot wounds. There is no other evidence to prove that Gong took Cheng Xiechao to Wuchang to assassinate former Chairman Yang twice, but according to Cheng Xiechao's confession, Gong Bozhou was late and missed the opportunity, which shows that Gong did not participate in the assassination. ⑷ Xiao Buyun, the attorney appointed by the court, defended Cao Bingrong and Li Qunjian. Cao Bingrong's act of marking Cheng Xiechao was not admitted by Cheng Xiechao. Since Cheng and others had been in Wuhan for a long time and were familiar with the terrain, there was actually no need for Cao Bingrong to mark the target or act as a lookout. Resisting the enemy and eliminating traitors is one thing, and whether there is an assassination organization is another. The investigation should not be carried out in detail. As for Li Qunjian, he was delivering letters for Yang Xiaoming as a private matter, and he was young and ignorant. Since there is no evidence to prove that there is an assassination organization, how can he be charged with a crime? ⑸ Zhou Qiyou, the attorney selected by Yang Qixin, said that Yang Qixin's behavior before August of last year was a mechanical act of writing letters for Gong Bozhou under environmental pressure. He joined the revolutionary corps as a member, but did not complete the formal procedures and should be declared innocent. ⑹ Chen Bangben, Yin Shaoxian Wen Maoguan, and Geng Yigong, the previous attorney of Nie Jingquan, defended Nie and others. Buying a gun was not an intentional act. The principals were all soldiers and had passports for self-defense purposes. Fan Qishu requested to be released on bail.</p>
<p>Finally, Xie Shengkan, the private attorney for the family of former Chairman Yang, stood up and demanded that Liu Luyin and others be held liable for compensation for the Yang family's maintenance and condolence money, and hoped that all the criminals would be punished to the full extent of the law. The debate ended at 2:00 PM and the court was adjourned. The court held a deliberation meeting to discuss the case yesterday afternoon, and the verdict will be pronounced today.

<h3>Japan's Quasi-Wartime Industrial Development in Northeast Advances Rapidly</h3>
<p>Plant oil production exceeds one million catties per day. Large factory established in Fuxin to manufacture petroleum.</p>
<p>Tokyo Newsletter. Conflicts between Japanese political parties and parliament have garnered significant attention from the press here, and people in our country are also closely following the development of this issue. In reality, this is merely a superficial problem. Regardless of who forms the cabinet in Japan, while their policies towards China may tend to change in method, the ultimate goal remains to advance along the original, consistent policy. People in our country must first recognize this to gain insight into Japanese politics. The most important undertaking for Japan at present is the "quasi-wartime issue," which is even more crucial than Japanese political turmoil. A certain Japanese individual has thoroughly investigated the "Manchurian" quasi-wartime industry and submitted a report to relevant parties in Tokyo. The contents are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Chemical Industrial Products</p>
<p>There are very few specialized factories for pharmaceutical products in "Manchuria." Only sulfuric acid and nitric acid are manufactured by the "Manchuria" Industrial Company, with the former producing 6,500 tons and the latter 1,000 tons. Hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfide are manufactured by the Sankyo Company and the Kanmo Industrial Factory. The equipment of the Sankyo Company can produce three and a half tons of hydrochloric acid per day. The manufacturing facilities include the Kanmo Shoten Dalian Branch Pharmaceutical Factory, the Sankyo Company, the "Manchuria" Pharmaceutical Company, the Kanmo Industrial Factory, and the Fengtian Acid Manufacturing Company, the Fushun Coal Mine Sulfuric Acid Factory, etc. The remainder are byproducts of other industries. The main products are sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium sulfide, ammonium nitrate, oxygen, etc. The current sulfuric acid manufacturers include the Showa Steel Works, the "Manchuria" Chemical Industrial Company, the Fushun Coal Mine Sulfuric Acid Factory, and the Benxi Lake Coal and Iron Company, etc. The capacity of these factories is 873 tons per day. With factories currently being expanded, the daily output could reach 930 tons once completed, demonstrating the Japanese dedication to developing the "Manchurian" chemical industry. The production volume of each factory since Showa 6 (the September 18th Incident) is recorded below:</p>
<p>Sodium hydroxide production is two and a half tons per day. The Kanmo Industrial Factory produces 45,000 bottles of hydrochloric acid per month and 70,050 bottles of sodium sulfide. Oxygen is manufactured by the Dalian Oil and Fat Industrial Company, the Dalian Machinery Manufacturing Plant, and the Fengtian Oxygen Manufacturing Company, etc. In terms of factory equipment, the Dalian Oil and Fat Industry produces 560,000 koku per year, the Dalian Machinery Manufacturing Plant 380,000 koku, and the Fengtian Oxygen Manufacturing Company 600,000 koku at its Fengtian factory and approximately 86,000 koku at its Harbin factory.</p>
<p>Plant Oil Production Volume</p>
<p>The most significant plant oil is soybean oil. There are 319 oil press factories in Southern Manchuria and 48 in Northern Manchuria, totaling 367. The daily soybean oil production capacity is 1,779,970 catties. However, many have been shut down recently due to poor management. In Showa 10, the production of soybean cake was 3,906,333 koku, with soybean oil totaling approximately 19,816,500 catties. The next largest is perilla oil, which is manufactured by the Nisshin Oil Company and the Santai Oil Mill. Production volume has increased recently. In Showa 5, it was only 5,320 tons, but it increased to 15,124 tons the following year. Recently, the Datong Pharmaceutical Industrial Company has also begun manufacturing perilla oil and peppermint oil, etc.</p>
<p>Mineral Oil Manufacturing Methods</p>
<p>The main mineral oil is cottonseed oil. The "Manchuria" Petroleum Company refines gasoline, kerosene, light oil, and machine oil, etc., with an annual output of 120,000 tons. The Fushun Coal Mine Oil Plant produces 66,000 tons of heavy oil, 20,000 tons of crude wax, and 24,000 tons of gasoline annually. Since last year, there have been plans to increase production by extracting 300,000 tons of crude oil, producing 20,000 tons of crude wax, 14,000 tons of kerosene, 15,000 tons of cracked gasoline, and 5,000 tons of straight-run gasoline. Regarding coal liquefaction, the "Manchuria" Oil and Chemical Industry Company was established last year with a capital of 2.5 million yuan. The company is located in Sipingjie and employs the oilification method invented by Mr. Kuroi Chiyokichi, a Japanese steel technician. The first production plan is to manufacture 10,000 tons of gasoline from 100,000 tons of raw coal per year. The coal liquefaction research being conducted by South Manchuria Railway requires an investment of 1.6 million in capital to establish a new factory in Fushun. Powerful Japanese capitalists centered around the "Manchuria" Coal Mine have joined together to establish a large factory in Fuxin, with plans to produce 200,000 tons of petroleum per year, demonstrating the Japanese dedication to developing national defense chemical industry.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Establishing a Tap Water Company</p>
<p>County Magistrate Deng Xianghai, in order to improve the drinking water of citizens and emphasize public health, has joined with local figures such as Zhang Yipeng to establish a tap water company. They have negotiated with relevant parties several times and have made progress. The funds will be advanced by the Shanghai Construction Bank, and the machinery and water pipes will be supplied by the Siemens foreign firm. County Magistrate Deng specifically went to Shanghai yesterday to negotiate with the Construction Bank again. After the methods are determined, a preparatory office will be established to carry out all preparations.</p>
<p>Deadline for Eliminating Opium Addiction</p>
<p>Wu County is working very hard on opium prohibition, aiming to eliminate it entirely by the end of July next year. The county government has set a deadline of the 15th of this month for the arrest of opium addicts and private opium dealers. Those who exceed the deadline will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Lixin Cloth Factory Strike</p>
<p>The Lixin Textile Dyeing Factory in this city earned more than 2 million yuan last year, and the workers should have received 160,000 yuan in bonuses, including 48,000 yuan for the workers. However, the bonuses have not been paid, causing dissatisfaction among the workers. More than 7,000 workers went on strike and demonstrated on the evening of the 5th, assaulting police officers and destroying the accounting office and staff dormitories. The factory director, Long Fei, persuaded the workers and promised to negotiate the workers' demands with the capitalists on behalf of the Party and government, so the case may be resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Refugees Rob Farmers</p>
<p>A large number of refugees arrived in Sheqian, Xiaoshan, on the first day and forcibly demanded silver and rice from the farmers. At that time, more than 100 yuan in banknotes were forcibly taken in Yulin Pass. On the second day, they went to Wenyan, where the police station sent police officer Zhang Zaixiang to suppress them and force them out of the territory. Unexpectedly, the refugees committed further robberies in Yinjiashan, losing more than 200 yuan in total. On the third day, they robbed civilian homes again in Jinxi Bridge, stealing dozens of yuan worth of rapeseed. They were then expelled from Xiaoshan by the local police.</p>
<h3>Dinghai</h3>
<p>筹组渔业合作社</p>
<p>Shenjiamen, in Dinghai, is the fishing center of eastern Zhejiang. The total value of various fish products produced annually exceeds 10 million yuan. However, there is a lack of cooperative spirit, leading to plummeting fish prices and a decline in the fishing industry. Recently, intellectuals in the fishing industry, for the sake of control and revival, plan to unite fishermen, fish merchants, and ice merchants to organize a production and sales cooperative. After applying for registration, preparations will be made for its establishment.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Leveling Salt Evaporation Ponds on the Coast</p>
<p>Along the coast of Tong County, the Xiaoyanggang Huaidong Village area has many salt evaporation ponds like a honeycomb. Villagers privately produce salt, which hinders official sales. The Huainan Tax Police Bureau sent personnel to lead police to destroy all the salt evaporation ponds and sent a tax police team to patrol Haifeng to prevent the private scraping of salty soil for salt production.</p>
<p>Water Police Seize Opium Trafficker</p>
<p>The First District Water Police Investigation Team seized a large quantity of smuggled opium on the Baofeng transport ship. The trafficker, Shen Xiaomao, was arrested on the spot with 257 taels of opium. The opium was hidden inside more than 20 cedar planks that had been hollowed out in the middle and tied together with rope at both ends to look seamless. The suspect and the evidence have been handed over to the district security command for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Robbers Brutally Torture Elderly Woman</p>
<p>Sun Hanxiong, a farmer in Jinyajiang Township, Fifth District, had some savings in his home, which attracted the covetousness of robbers. On the night before last, dozens of robbers suddenly arrived with guns and broke into his house, scaring the family into silence and firing shots as a warning. The Hanxiong family was completely tied up. The robbers stripped Hanxiong's elderly mother naked, hung her from the beam, tied her feet tightly with ropes, and then used cotton wool soaked in kerosene to burn between her legs to force her to hand over silver dollars. They also ransacked the house, taking all valuables. The Hanxiong family and the hanged elderly mother were only able to escape after the robbers left. After investigation, the losses were estimated to be worth more than 1,000 yuan. Hanxiong's mother, due to her old age and frailty, and because both her front and back genitalia were burned, is now unable to pass stool or urine, and her condition is quite critical.</p>

<h3>The Third Session of Civic Training Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Simultaneously Held the Coaching Institute's Inauguration Ceremony; Reviewing Officers Were Commander Yang and Acting Mayor Yu; Representatives from Various Agencies Gave Sincere Words of Encouragement</p>
<p>The inauguration ceremony of the Cadre Coaching Institute of the Municipal Civic Training Office, and the graduation ceremony of the third session of the civic training of the Training Corps, were held yesterday morning (the 6th, at 8:00 AM) at Longhua Airport. Over ten thousand people attended, including senior officials from various agencies, representatives from various groups, trainees, and graduating team members. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Reviewing Officers</p>
<p>The ceremony was presided over by Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun. On both sides of the chairman's platform, there was a couplet: the first line was "Embodying soldiers in agriculture, industry, and commerce, the spirit of three generations promotes our martial prowess," and the second line was "Enlightening the people with wisdom, benevolence, and courage, ten years of education have the teachers of the past." On the viewing stands to the left and right of the chairman's platform, there was a horizontal banner on each side: the left one read "Good citizens are the foundation of good soldiers," and the right one read "Good soldiers are the model of good citizens." The arrangements were simple and the atmosphere was solemn. After the flag-raising ceremony, a military review and parade were held. The general commander was Tao Yishan, the commander of the Training Corps of the office, and the deputy commanders were Zhao Zhuzhong and Tang Huicha. The reviewing officers were Acting Mayor Yu and Yang Hu, the commander of the Songhu Garrison. Accompanying them were Qiu Yangwu and Zhang Shaochen, representatives of the Training Supervision Department; Cai Jinjun, a representative of the Ministry of the Interior; Qian Dajun and Zhang Zhizhong, former education directors of the Central Military Academy, represented by Xing Zhennan; Wang Xiaoji, Speaker of the Municipal Council; Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Municipal Local Association; and Ji Tingan, Jiang Huaisu, Zhou Yongneng, Wu Guangu, and Li Xiangqi, Director of the office, and Wang Shaoqi, Deputy Director; and Ji Jian, General Commander of the Municipal Security General Corps, Wen Huazhou, General Commander of the Corps, Yue Tuanzhang, Commander of the First Corps, Jiang Tuanzhang, Commander of the First Corps, and Zhu Xia, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters, as judges. The trainees and team members were all full of energy and proficient in their drills. The achievements they made in such a short period of training were truly commendable and earned thunderous applause from the audience.</p>
<p>Realistic Performance</p>
<p>Following this, the trainees were divided into eastern and western armies to conduct a combat exercise. At the sound of a bugle, the sounds of gunfire echoed, smoke filled the air, and soldiers fell forward one after another, as if facing a real enemy. Smoke bombs were released, and the vast airport was transformed into a battlefield filled with the smell of gunpowder. More than thirty female students from Guanghua High School's rescue team also performed a rescue drill. The stretcher-bearing, bandaging, and escorting were rapid and accurate, and extremely realistic. The team then performed bayonet drills, broadsword exercises, boxing defense, sword stick techniques, and the "Arhat-Subduing Demons" formation, all of which were very energetic. At around 10:00 AM, the ceremony began. The entire audience performed the rituals, and under the leadership of the Director and Deputy Director of the Civic Training Office, all team members took an oath. Mayor Yu then presented certificates.</p>
<p>Mayor Yu said, "Brothers, I feel very comforted and excited. In the past year or so, civic training has followed the direction indicated by our supreme leader, and with the concerted efforts of officials at all levels and everyone, although only five, six, seven, or eight thousand people are trained each session, this number is not large in proportion to Shanghai's population of more than 3.7 million. However, if we are determined to continue training for one, two, three, or even ten or twenty years, it will not be difficult to have all Shanghai citizens trained. An ancient saying goes, 'The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is solid, the state is secure,' and another saying goes, 'The people are the most important, the gods of the soil and grain are next, and the ruler is the least important.' These are words from an autocratic era, but they are meaningful because the strength of a nation lies in its people. Therefore, the first of the Three Principles of the People of the Premier is nationalism. The two phrases 'Good iron is not used to make nails' and 'Good men do not become soldiers' have misled China for more than two thousand years. Now the government has seen this and has made a great determination to change the previous erroneous views of the people and to work hard through civic training. While the quantity of civic training is important, the quality is especially important. I hope that all graduating team members today will maintain the spirit instilled by the leaders at all levels while in the team and will absolutely adhere to the tenets of the New Life Movement advocated by our supreme leader: know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame; take responsibility; and observe discipline. You are citizens who have received military training, and it is especially important to know shame. As an ancient saying goes, 'Knowing shame is close to courage.' I believe that if every Chinese person knew shame, there would never be so many traitors in the three northeastern provinces and eastern Hebei. If China had no traitors, it would never be destroyed." The mayor then inspected the ranks and gave his speech. Commander Yang and representatives from various military and political officials also gave speeches. The office's Director Li gave a reply, followed by the shouting of slogans, a photo session, and adjournment.</p>
<p>Mayor Yu's Speech</p>
<p>In brief, he said, "Today is the graduation of the third session of the Shanghai Civic Training Corps, and also the inauguration ceremony of the Cadre Coaching Institute. Seeing everyone full of spirit and their movements neat and orderly, I am deeply moved. The rise and fall of a nation does not depend on the size of the army, but on whether the nation's strength is substantial. China has 400 million people, which is not few, so why are we still being bullied? The reason is that in the past, we lacked organization. No matter how many unorganized people there are, they are useless. Why are Chinese people unorganized? It is because they have been poisoned by autocratic monarchs since the Qin Dynasty, which has led to the erroneous concept that the people are often soldiers, that is, as the saying goes, 'Good iron is not used to make nails, good men do not become soldiers.' I not only hope that everyone will maintain the spirit they had while training but also hope that you will vigorously promote it to society so that all compatriots recognize their responsibility to save the country and strive to become stronger, eliminating the bad habits of being decadent, perfunctory, lazy, and complacent. Only then can they become sound citizens. Also, I hope that the students of the Cadre Coaching Institute will study hard in the short period and be able to truly undertake the work of civic training cadres in the future, laying the foundation for civic training. Finally, I hope that everyone will remember not to disappoint the government and our supreme leader."</p>
<p>Commander Yang's Speech</p>
<p>In brief, he said, "Looking at your spirit, I can tell that all the officers are very responsible and all the team members are working hard. I deeply admire civic training, which is very important for the future of the country. The future of the country depends on the strength of our people. Your responsibility is even greater after graduation. You should always keep your responsibilities in mind and not forget the hard work and teachings of Director Li and officers at all levels. At the same time, I hope that the students of the Cadre Coaching Institute will first train themselves and then train others. I also hope that you will strive for success," and so on.</p>
<p>Speech from the General Supervision Department</p>
<p>In brief, he said, "I heard in Nanjing that civic training in Shanghai is very good. Today, after seeing it in Shanghai, it is indeed well-deserved. I am very excited. Civic training can be said to be an open-air school for all our people. The principal is Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek unified China after serving as the principal of Whampoa Military Academy. Now that he is also the principal of an open-air school, he will definitely be able to complete the task of revitalizing the Chinese nation. Everyone is now a student of Chairman Chiang. Receiving certificates and medals today is a comfort for now. Supporting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in revitalizing the Chinese nation is a comfort for the future. I hope that after leaving the team, you will still not forget production and, on the other hand, not forget to practice," and so on.</p>
<p>Speech from the Ministry of the Interior</p>
<p>In brief, he said, "Just now, the mayor talked about the New Life Movement and said that the most important thing is that everyone must encourage each other to know shame. Those who do not know shame will become traitors and slaves to the country. What the mayor said is extremely important. To save the country, we must know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame; take responsibility; and observe discipline. Foreigners say that we are an unorganized country. Why are we unorganized? It can be said that the biggest reason is the lack of discipline. An unorganized country is a country without true citizens. We must wash away this shame and start with discipline training. If our country is organized, we will not be afraid of being bullied. Constant training can achieve the goal of internal pacification and external resistance. We not only hope that everyone receives military training but also hope that everyone will strive to create a nation of people's police," and so on.</p>
<p>Speech from the Education Director</p>
<p>In brief, he said, "The slogan of any country today is the armed people because an armed people can protect their own lives on the one hand and protect the country and nation on the other. Those who study must hold a gun in one hand and a book in the other. Those who work in agriculture, industry, and commerce must also hold a gun in one hand and a hoe, tool, or abacus in the other. If such a country and nation are created, under the leadership of our leader, the work of revitalizing the nation will definitely be successful immediately," and so on.</p>
<p>Speaker Wang's Speech</p>
<p>In brief, he said, "Seeing everyone's spirit today, I deeply admire you. People say that Shanghai is a place of enjoyment, but enjoying happiness will lead to the destruction of the country. We must work hard to save the country. Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. I hope that everyone will take good care of their bodies, not be afraid of storms and rain, and not be afraid of the sun, so that they can save and defend the country," and so on.</p>
<p>Director Li's Reply</p>
<p>In brief, he said, "Today is the graduation ceremony of the third session of civic training and the inauguration ceremony of the Cadre Coaching Institute. I am grateful to Mayor, Commander, all representatives, all officials, all gentlemen, and all guests for taking the time to personally attend and give us many important instructions. We are very grateful. I, Li Xiangqi, on behalf of all the officials, students, and team members, express our acceptance and gratitude, and on behalf of all the performers and team members, I have two points to report. First, we all know that civic training is truly the only way for our Chinese nation to be self-aware, self-reliant, self-confident, self-strengthening, self-saving, and self-preserving. We are willing to permanently maintain the spirit of training and be soldiers in the revitalization of the Chinese nation. Second, we know that since the beginning of training, all team members and students have been fully empowered in terms of spirit, material, education, and academics by the instructions of the Mayor, Commander, all officials, and all gentlemen, and have been encouraged, cared for, and supported by all sectors of Shanghai, which is why we have achieved today's results. We are willing, from now on, to continue to be encouraged, instructed, cared for, and supported by everyone so that we can improve every day. In addition, I, Li Xiangqi, also have two sentences to tell all the students and team members. The first sentence is that I hope everyone will not forget the great and solemn impression of today's graduation and inauguration ceremony and will maintain the spirit of "newness, love, precision, and sincerity" as a whole, always remembering their responsibility to the country and the nation. The second sentence is that I hope everyone will bring today's spirit back to their homes, to society, and to their workplaces, giving others a good impression and a good example. They must not have any feelings of pride, exaggeration, or selfishness. In short, we must constantly exercise our bodies, strive for our studies, cultivate our morals, and always maintain our spirit to fight and sacrifice for society, the country, and the nation under the leadership of our only leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek."</p>

<h3>Liu Xiang Expresses Absolute Support for the Central Government</h3>
<p>Telegram Reply to the Sichuan Fellow Countrymen Association Yesterday</p>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai previously sent a telegram to Liu Xiang, Chairman of Sichuan Province, urging him to come to Nanjing as soon as possible to report on his duties in order to dispel doubts, as there were rumors that Liu Xiang's attitude was different, causing concerns in all quarters. It is now learned that the association received a reply from Liu yesterday, expressing absolute support for the central government and stating that he would go to Nanjing to report to the central government as soon as his health improves. The original telegram read, "To the Sichuan Fellow Countrymen Association on Jiujiang Road, Greetings. Received the telegram from Jianri. I am sincerely grateful for the care and love of the fellow countrymen. I have always been determined to assist the central government in completing the unification. I will do everything possible to avoid anything that may cause misunderstandings. I have also been sending people to Nanjing from time to time to request instructions and assist in major military and political plans. I have also been accepting and implementing various instructions from the central government. Regarding the matter of going to Nanjing to report on my duties, it is my sincere wish. However, I have just recovered from a long illness and am weak and unused to long flights. As soon as I am a little stronger, I will still go to Nanjing to report everything in person and take the opportunity to learn from you. Thank you for your concern. I am sending a telegram to reply and express my gratitude. Liu Xiang kowtows, Dong Shengmi."</p>
<h3>Magnificent Architecture and Perfect Facilities; Qiujiang Pier to Open on the 10th</h3>
<p>Grand Ceremony Awaits President Kong's Return to Host; Changxing's Japanese Empress to Make Maiden Voyage; Business Management and Transportation Facilities Planned and Ready</p>
<p>The Qiujiang Pier, built by the Central Bank, is the most modern cargo transfer facility in the East. Construction began in June of last year and the first phase of the project has now been completed after a year. It is scheduled to open on the 10th of this month. The official opening ceremony will be held after President Kong returns to the country. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Construction Background</p>
<p>Pier business is closely related to international trade. Countries with developed commerce all build complete piers in their commercial centers to facilitate the loading and unloading of import and export goods. Shanghai is China's trade center, but it lacks this new construction. Therefore, the Central Bank purchased land at the mouth of the Qiujiang River in the Yinjiang District to invest in the construction of the Qiujiang Pier. The shoreline of the river mouth is long and straight, and the river water is deep and wide, making it more convenient for ships to travel back and forth than other river basins. Song Ziliang, Chen Jian'an, Ye Zhuochang, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Keting, Zhang Gongquan, and Chadley were hired as pier construction committee members. The committee designed the building, and President Kong personally presided over the groundbreaking ceremony on June 20, 1936, and construction began immediately. It has now been a year, and the first phase of the project has been completely completed.</p>
<p>Perfect Equipment</p>
<p>The pier is located at the mouth of the Qiujiang River, north of the Huangpu River, and is approximately 1,500 feet long. Since construction began, the entire first-phase plan has been completed, including two piers, each 590 feet long, with a small port in the middle for berthing barges, and two warehouses, each 220 feet long and 130 feet wide, with two floors. There are four cranes, two inclined rollers, one one-ton and one six-ton elevator, and one hundred and fifty sliding cars. There is a large two-story office building, with the pier office on the upper floor and the customs inspection office and passenger reception room on the lower floor. There are also two temporary iron-roofed flat warehouses for short-term storage of goods, each 220 feet long and 80 feet wide. There are also three beams that run directly to the pier deck. The total warehouse capacity is approximately 15,000 tons of cargo, which is loaded and unloaded by cranes directly to any floor of the warehouse. The equipment is very perfect.</p>
<p>Opening Business</p>
<p>After the completion of the pier project, Ling Xianyang, manager of the Qiujiang Pier Business Management Office, and Chen Zikang, assistant manager, actively prepared and arranged the interior, which is now ready. It is scheduled to open on the 10th of this month. The grand opening ceremony will be held after President Kong returns to the country to preside over it, in order to show solemnity. Regarding the development of the pier business, it has also been decided that: ㊀ workers on the pier will be hired and trained through the workers' management committee; ㊁ the cost of trucks and barges for loading and unloading goods can be subsidized by the pier; two cars will be prepared to drive five or six times a day to pick up and drop off customers who want to see the goods for free; ㊂ passenger transportation and luggage matters will be entrusted to China Travel Service to handle, with a charge of 30 cents per piece for pickup and 40 cents per piece for delivery, and delivery can be made within one hour at the latest; and it has been agreed that Silver Taxi will pick up and drop off passengers for only one yuan per trip. At the same time, it has been agreed with China Bus Company and Shanghai Ferry Company to pick up and drop off passengers in advance whenever a ship arrives.</p>
<p>Maiden Voyage</p>
<p>Qiujiang Pier is the most modern pier in the East with perfect equipment. While the project was in progress, various shipping companies approached the pier's business office to arrange berthing procedures. It has now been decided that the first ship to make a maiden voyage to the pier will be the Japanese Empress of British Changxing Company. At that time, people from all walks of life will be invited to visit. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the Philippines on the 13th of this month and stay for one day before sailing to Vancouver, USA, the following morning. The second ship will be the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso, which will arrive in Shanghai from Europe on the 21st of the same month. Both of these ships are large international liners and have agreed with the pier to berth there on a long-term basis. Other shipping companies such as Dale, Java, and Mosti have also contacted the pier one after another to discuss berthing in order to facilitate passenger and cargo transportation.</p>
<p>Convenient Transportation</p>
<p>There are three transportation routes to the pier: ㊀ from Wuquan Road to Jungong Road to Yangshupu Road; ㊁ from Wuquan Road through the city center to Qimei Road to Diswei Road; ㊂ from Wule Road through the city center to Jiangwan Road to North Sichuan Road. Cars can travel directly on all of these routes in less than twenty minutes. China Bus Company will change the route of Route 6 from the 10th of this month to run through the city government to the pier. The fare for the entire route, which connects with Special Zone Route 9 Bus and Routes 4 and 5 of the company, is 41 cents. When foreign ships berth, special buses will be dispatched from the Baoshan Road intersection at a cost of 10 cents per person. Transportation can be described as convenient.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Dharma Treasure Museum Holds Tea Party</h3>
<p>Li Qiqing and Guan Jiongzhi Enthusiastically Donate; Great Compassion Dharma Master Delivers Important Remarks</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dharma Treasure Museum held a tea party the other day at the Buddhist Jingye Society's Xiangguang Hall to raise funds and solicit arrays of goods. Invitations, appointment letters, donation books, and regulations were sent out in advance. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Appointment of Committee Members</p>
<p>㊀ Respected Sir, In recent years, Buddhist undertakings have become increasingly prosperous, but there is no dedicated institution for the collection and exhibition of sutras and Dharma objects. In order to meet the needs and fulfill our responsibilities, we have built a Dharma Treasure Museum within the Buddhist Jingye Society in Shanghai Jueyuan. Although the building has been completed, the internal construction and maintenance require a great deal of funding. We are continuing our efforts to seek the compassion and sympathy of those who share our aspirations. We have long admired your pure vows and enthusiasm for benefiting all, and we hope that you will grant your blessings to our museum's establishment and growth. The first board meeting of our museum has publicly elected you as a member of the fundraising committee. We hereby send you a special letter of appointment and respectfully request that you accept the appointment, creating auspicious causes and eternally completing the pure karma. The fundraising methods are detailed in the enclosed booklet, which we hope you will review.</p>
<p>㊁ Respected Sir, In recent years, Buddhist undertakings have become increasingly prosperous, but there is no dedicated institution for the collection and exhibition of sutras and Dharma objects. In order to meet the needs and fulfill our responsibilities, we have built a Dharma Treasure Museum within the Shanghai Jueyuan Buddhist Jingye Society. Although the building has been completed, there are many classic images and all kinds of Dharma objects that have been scattered for decades and over tens of thousands of miles, and we urgently need to find ways to collect them. We are afraid that our strength is insufficient, and the first board meeting of our museum has ordered fifteen rules for collecting exhibits, and publicly elected you as a member of the exhibit collection committee. We have long admired your pure vows and enthusiasm for benefiting all, and we hope that you will grant your blessings to this undertaking of our museum. We hereby send you a letter of appointment and respectfully request that you accept the appointment, creating immeasurable merit.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation</p>
<p>Dozens of directors and committee members attended the meeting that day, including Ye Yufu, Guan Jiongzhi, Li Qiqing, Ding Guiqiao, Jian Yujie, Ding Guicen, Dong Hanzhi, Li Fuhou, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Qu Wenliu, Fei Fanjiu, Ding Zhonghu, He Shaoyu, Zhao Pucha, Great Compassion Dharma Master, and Yuan Ao Dharma Master. Director Ye Yufu presided over the meeting, and the museum's secretary, Qian Zhongzhi, took notes. First, the chairman reported on the museum's initiation and construction process, as well as the procedures and key points for future progress. Next, the fundraising and exhibit collection methods were discussed.</p>
<p>It was then resolved that:</p>
<p>Each committee member should raise funds within June of this year. It is estimated that the manufacture of cabinets and other items will require 10,000 yuan, and the fund will require more than 20,000 yuan. At that time, Li Qiqing pledged to donate the entire year's expenses, totaling 1,200 yuan. Guan Jiongzhi and Huang Hanzhi of Jingye Society pledged to donate eight display cabinets, totaling 1,700 yuan. In addition, He Shaoyu, Ding Zhonghu, and others also pledged to donate successively. Great Compassion Dharma Master of Liuyun Temple also delivered,</p>
<p>Important Remarks</p>
<p>Believing that the establishment of the Dharma Treasure Museum is truly an innovation in Chinese Buddhism, the vastness of China's land, the long history of Buddhism, and the dispersion and destruction of classics and Dharma objects are bound to be many, which is very painful. From now on, there will be a well-equipped and well-managed Dharma Treasure Museum to collect and preserve them, which is very fortunate. At the same time, it can also encourage various temples to pay attention. It was immediately decided that the Chinese Buddhist Association would send a letter to all temples across the country, informing them of the significance and role of the establishment of the Dharma Treasure Museum, and requesting donations of money, sutras, images, and Dharma objects.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Shipping Competition</h3>
<p>Companies Salvage Hunan Line, Fares to Sichuan Decreased in Stages</p>
<p>This year's shipping trend has shifted from the Yangtze River to coastal routes, so Nanyang [Southeast Asia] business has recently become very prosperous. There are more goods than ships, a lack of tonnage, and Shanghai's ship tonnage prices have soared again, increasing to 10 shillings per ton, equivalent to about 8.5 yuan in various currencies. At this time last year, the rental price per ton was only 2.5 yuan. Compared with the past, it has increased by about three times. Therefore, the five major shipping companies, Taikoo, Nissin, Jardine Matheson, etc., convened a meeting yesterday to discuss further increasing fares. In addition to the 10% increase on May 1st and June 1st, it has now been decided to increase another 10% on July 1st. The locations where the price increase will be implemented are Shanghai to Fuzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Yantai, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Tianjin and other ports. On the Yangtze River, however, competition from independent [lit. "wild flag"] ships has emerged, reducing fares and causing a major blow to the six companies, which are now trying to salvage the situation and defeat this powerful competitor. This matter has a significant impact on the shipping industry, as described below:</p>
<p>Resisting Competition on the Shanghai-Hunan Route</p>
<p>Last year, Hunan's farmland had a bumper harvest, and grain was shipped to various places, greatly increasing the purchasing power of farmers. The amount of goods shipped from Shanghai to Hunan increased six to seven times compared to previous years. As a result, the shipping business along the Shanghai-Changsha route was exceptionally prosperous. The six companies competed to dispatch dedicated Jianglun [river steamer] ships to transport goods back and forth. Initially, due to the dry season in the Xiang River, making navigation difficult, freight rates increased to 110%. Until now, with the Xiang River's water level rising and the Shanghai-Hunan route clear, the accumulated goods being loaded were substantial. The six companies jointly agreed that the miscellaneous freight rate would be 15 yuan per ton. Unexpectedly, Yongtai Company suddenly chartered the Yong'an and Shenfu ships to operate routes from Shanghai to Hankou and Changsha, competing with the six companies on the Shanghai-Hunan route. Because they were not bound by the public allocation of costs, they reduced the freight rate to only 7.5 yuan per ton, only half of the six companies' rate. After the start of operations, the six companies were greatly impacted. Currently, after repeated discussions among the six companies, a decision has been made to resist. First, the Yong'an ship, chartered by Yongtai, was leased by the China Merchants Bureau in name from the shipowner, Da Zhen Shipping Company, for a monthly rental of more than 6,000 yuan, which has been successfully done. The second ship, Shenfu, is also being leased by the six companies, preventing Yongtai from operating any ships, thus eliminating this competition invisibly. It is heard that the Yong'an lease agreement has been verified by the China Merchants Bureau. This ship will likely be assigned to the Hunan route. The leasing method for Shenfu is currently being negotiated with the ship owner, Ewo [Yee Lung] Trading Company. From now on, independent ships will not be allowed to gain a foothold on the Yangtze River, whether upstream or downstream.</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Sichuan Shipping</p>
<p>In the past three years, the Sichuan River shipping industry can be said to have reached its peak, creating the newest record since 1917. The Minsheng Company, which specializes in this route, had annual profits of more than one million yuan in these three years, while Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, and others also had annual profits of tens of thousands of yuan each. The largest category of goods going from Shanghai on this route is cotton yarn. A year ago, when freight rates were at their lowest, cotton yarn was charged only three yuan per piece, or only twelve yuan per ton. Now, each piece has risen to 26 yuan, or 104 yuan per ton. Two months ago, when the Sichuan River was shallow and navigation was done in three sections, each freight charge reached more than 40 yuan. Other goods also rose to hundreds of yuan. Steel machinery even rose to more than 200 yuan per ton. During this period of extreme prosperity, a major drought occurred in Sichuan, covering dozens of counties. The purchasing power of the Sichuan people plummeted. Now, at a time when the water level is rising and the route is clear, which is normally the peak period for goods being shipped, all goods are being stopped due to the impact of the drought. There is no outbound traffic at all. Shanghai's Sichuan businesses have already stopped handling people and goods together. The business of the ships traveling on the Sichuan River has also declined sharply. Due to the shortage of outbound goods, income has been greatly reduced. The Minsheng Company has already transferred most of its ships to Yichang to transport materials accumulated on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway into Sichuan for adjustment. In recent days, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Minsheng, Nissin, Sanbei, and other six companies have held multiple meetings and decided to decrease Shanghai freight rates to Sichuan in stages. In the first stage, the price of cotton yarn will drop by eight yuan per ton, and miscellaneous goods will also drop by ten yuan. This measure has already been implemented yesterday, but some companies have privately released discounts and lowered the cotton yarn freight rate to 24 yuan per ton. However, even though freight rates have fallen, there are still no goods to load. There is a trend for further declines in the third stage.</p>

<h3>China Association for the Deaf and Mute Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chairman Hopes to Promote Deaf and Mute Education; Elected Li Dingqing, Hong Guiming, etc. as Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>The China Association for the Deaf and Mute held its inaugural meeting at the Deaf and Mute School in Xiaonanmen at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. More than one hundred members from the Central Department of Civic Training and the City Party Committee, represented by Huang Tiren, the Social Bureau, represented by Xu Manxin, and Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and other places were present. Wang Xun, Sun Zuhui, and Dai Shishi were elected as the presidium. After deliberation, various proposals to promote deaf and mute careers were passed, and directors and supervisors were elected. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Dai Shishi gave a report, stating that the association was officially established today, and he was honored to have representatives from party and government agencies and guests from all walks of life participate and provide guidance. He himself was neither deaf nor mute, and being elected as chairman was a case of "filling a position without ability." He had been engaged in deaf and mute education for more than ten years and had a considerable understanding of the psychology of the deaf and mute. At the same time, the deaf and mute had a very sincere attitude towards him in all aspects. The world thinks that the blind are pitiful, but although the blind cannot see, they can still gain a considerable understanding. The deaf and mute, due to physiological abnormalities, find it difficult to acquire knowledge, so their suffering is indeed greater than that of the blind. History shows that Zuo Qiuming in the Spring and Autumn period and the Russian poet Eroshchenko were all famous blind people, but there were almost no famous deaf and mute people. It can be seen that the deaf and mute are the most unfortunate among human beings. The number of deaf and mute people in our country is extremely large, and their symptoms can be divided into congenital and acquired, with acquired being the majority. According to a worldwide survey, deaf and mute people account for one in every thousand people. China has fewer requests for sanitation, so the number of people suffering from deafness and muteness accounts for about 450,000. The number of deaf and mute schools in the country, including the three northeastern provinces, is only about twenty, and there are even more deaf and mute people who have not received education and relief. As a result, there is very little contact between the deaf and mute. This association was founded for the sake of the happiness of the deaf and mute. Fortunately, it has been smoothly carried out with the enthusiastic support of the party and government authorities and social leaders, which is deeply gratifying. It is hoped that the government will widely establish public deaf and mute schools, popularize deaf and mute education, and recruit deaf and mute employees in state-owned factories as much as possible to save the unemployed deaf and mute. This is especially desired.</p>
<p>Party and Government Instructions</p>
<p>Then Huang Tiren, representative of the Central Department of Civic Training and the City Party Committee, gave instructions, which Dai Shishi conveyed through gestures, stating that he was deeply honored to attend the inaugural meeting of the China Association for the Deaf and Mute. He had just heard the chairman's report and knew that there were as many as 450,000 deaf and mute people in China, and that only a few of them were educated. The establishment of this association today is the prelude to seeking the happiness of the deaf and mute. He hoped that the association would uphold the spirit of mutual assistance, seek self-reliance, alleviate the suffering of the same disease, and awaken the deaf and mute compatriots across the country to unite and save themselves. Then, Xu Manxin, representative of the Social Bureau, gave a speech, stating that he was attending the Inaugural meeting of the association today, seeing that everyone could not speak and had to rely on gestures to convey their meaning, he felt very pitiful. However, due to the establishment of the association, the deaf and mute people across the country would help and unite with each other, which made him feel gratified. Facts have proved that the intelligence of the deaf and mute is not lower than that of ordinary people. In the future, with their own unity and the common support of the people of the country, they will be able to develop the cause of the deaf and mute and increase the welfare of the deaf and mute. Then, Wang Jingyuan, consultant of the association, gave a speech to encourage the deaf and mute students. The content of the speech was omitted. Finally, Chairman Dai Shishi gave a reply.</p>
<p>Congress Proposals</p>
<p>After passing the constitution, the proposals were discussed. ㊀ Sending representatives to the capital to request the government to subsidize annual expenses was resolved and passed. ㊁ Holding a national deaf and mute exhibition was resolved and passed. ㊂ Before the problem of deaf and mute careers is resolved, the association should ask the factories for voluntary guidance and conduct field research, or the association should add research classes to solve livelihood problems, which was resolved and passed. ㊃ The association should publish a monthly magazine for further study, which was resolved and passed.</p>
<p>Elected Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>Then, directors and supervisors were elected, including Li Dingqing, He Yulin, Wang Xun, Chen Zhuoxiang, Sun Zuhui, Ge Zhenmin, and Sun Minsheng, etc. seven people as directors; Jiang Zhiyuan, Chen Zugeng, and Qian Jiaqiu were substitutes; Hong Guiming, Hong Chengguan, and Shao Guanghao, etc. three people were supervisors, Huang Huanian was a substitute and were sworn into office on the spot.</p>
<h3>Minister to Denmark Wu Nanru Returns to Post</h3>

<h3>Zhu Qinglan Discusses Disaster Relief with Various Sectors</h3>
<p>Chen Tiesheng to Fly to Sichuan Within Days</p>
<p>Zhu Ziqiao of the Relief Committee went to Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi a month ago to investigate the disaster situation and allocate relief funds. He has recently returned to Beijing to report everything to the government. The night before last, he came to Shanghai from Beijing and discussed disaster relief plans with Wang Yiting, Lu Bohong, Chen Tiesheng, and other leaders of charitable organizations in this city, and had contacts with various sectors. It is expected that he will return to Beijing within days. Also, Chen Tiesheng, deputy director of the China Children's Welfare Association, will fly to Sichuan within days after contacting Zhu, planning to set up two disaster children shelters in Tongchuan (Santai) and Chongqing, and also planning to set up several disaster children shelters in Shaanxi and Gansu.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Disaster Relief Association Cables Sichuan to Reduce Land Tax</h3>
<p>Victims Unable to Rest, Annual Collection Should Be Changed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association cabled Chairman Liu of Sichuan Province yesterday, saying, "Chairman Liu of Chengdu, Fu Chengxunjian, Sichuan Province has been followed by natural disasters after man-made disasters, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and everything has been exhausted. To alleviate the people's strength, we must first reduce the burden. It is heard that your budget for land tax is still set at four collections per year, plus various local surcharges, which are already more than 80%. At this time of prolonged drought, sowing is delayed, Eastern works have not been repaired, and Western harvests are hopeless. The only thing that the people rely on to pay food taxes is to sell agricultural products, but now there is nothing to sell. How can we raise money? I am afraid that the trouble of chasing and arresting in the future will be even worse than today's drought. I despise the remnants who do not die from disasters but die from taxes. Looking at the future, I can't help but feel cold. It is a common practice to collect taxes once a year. All provinces are the same, but Sichuan is uniquely different. Under the central government, it should not be uniquely different. When the Sichuan incident was just settled and the Sichuan finances were not managed, it can still be excused as a temporary period of difficulty and having to endure it. It has been three years since then, with two rounds of troop reductions and financial stability. In the midst of the inability to save the dying, we still do not hesitate to follow this huge evil system. When can we hope to abolish it? Even if the military and political expenses are related, it seems appropriate to strictly review the fraudulent expenses and reduce expenses. If it is not enough, the central government should make overall plans and act concurrently, and cannot only increase land tax as a way to make up for the budget. This is the only way that the dying victims can get a little rest. Therefore, to relieve the Sichuan disaster, no matter whether it is a temporary or fundamental solution, it is the first important strategy to stipulate that land tax will be collected once a year from the 26th year. The directors are concerned about the people's suffering and care deeply about the Sichuan disaster. The people admire them. I hope that this relief strategy will be adopted and implemented, and I dare to report it by cable. I hope that you will supervise it. The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association bows,</p>

<h3>Iron Lung Man Slater Left Shanghai for the United States Last Night</h3>
<p>Left Lester Chinese Hospital at Noon, with Crowds Watching; Stopped Breathing for Two Minutes While Changing New Iron Lung</p>
<p>American boy patient Slater, who was treated with an iron lung for paralysis, arrived in Shanghai at 2:01 AM on the 4th of this month. After entering Lester Chinese Hospital, he left the hospital at 12:05 PM yesterday and boarded the President Coolidge to return to his country. When crossing the Huangpu River and boarding the ship at 2:00 PM, he stopped breathing for two minutes while changing to a new iron lung. He then safely entered his reserved room. At 6:15 PM, the ship weighed anchor and returned to the United States. It is expected to arrive in San Francisco on the 18th.</p>
<p>Stayed in Shanghai for Two and a Half Days</p>
<p>The iron lung man arrived in Shanghai early in the morning on the 4th and entered Lester Chinese Hospital on North Suzhou Road at 6:00 AM on the same day. He lived as usual during these two days without any abnormalities. At 12:00 PM yesterday, he left the hospital and took a truck numbered 13402 in the Shanghai Municipal Council and 16610 in the French Concession to board the Coolidge. When he came out of the hospital, there were more than 1,000 onlookers inside and outside the hospital. Slater left the room on the fifth floor at 12:05 PM and boarded the truck on a pre-arranged escalator. The motor was still moving slowly, and the speed of the car was three miles per hour.</p>
<p>Arrived at the New Customs at 12:30 PM</p>
<p>If calculated from the time he left Lester Chinese Hospital, he only stayed in Shanghai for two and a half days. The car he took was the same as when he arrived in Beijing. The colored iron lung was placed in the car, and the car was also equipped with a motor. It was reported that when he arrived at the New Customs Wharf, the Public Concession Police Department would send personnel to maintain order and prevent idlers from approaching to prevent infection. However, the workers of the Shanghai Transportation Company and the Mautai Foreign Company still did not wear masks and helped the iron lung man up and down.</p>
<p>Stopped Breathing When Boarding the Ship</p>

At 6:15 PM, he safely set sail for the United States.</p>
<p>Two Doctors Talk About Ordinary Life</p>
<p>In addition to his parents, there were also about 20 American doctors, six Chinese nurses, and engineers on this trip.

<h3>The Number of Rickshaw Thefts in the City Has Increased Daily</h3>
<p>Eleven Vehicles Stolen in Six Days</p>
<p>There are 22,000 rickshaws operating in the city's Nanzha, Beite, and Huxi districts. Since the Taiping Insurance Company underwrote theft insurance from the first of this month, the gangsters who relied on stealing rickshaws and extorting money have been greatly panicked. The main leaders in this regard are Zhou Bugen, Xiao Dexi, and Xiao Changsheng in Zhabei, and Wu Er Meizi, Li Guoer, Deng Zhaozhi, Chen Xihua, and Xiao Sosan in Nanshi. They once discussed and implemented drastic measures to steal a number of rickshaws in the shortest possible time, so that the insurance company would stop insurance work and restore the previous state of stealing and redeeming. In the past five or six days, three municipal rickshaws were stolen before and after Xinmin Road and Wuzhen Road Bridge on Hengfeng Road in Zhabei, and four rickshaws were stolen around the Sixteenth Bund in Nanshi. There were also many rickshaws stolen at night at four depots. Among them, most of the rubber inner and outer tires were stripped off and discarded in remote alleys, and were taken in by the local police station. The association prepared a letter to collect them on behalf of the owners and compensated according to the insurance regulations. The losses of the rickshaw pullers are very limited, but the insurance company is temporarily bearing a heavy burden. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will seriously investigate and arrest these people and send them to the vagrant work-study center to eliminate harm to the rickshaw pullers, so as not to lose the effort.</p>
<h3>Railway Police Falsely Report Robbery to Cover Up Shooting and Injury of Pedestrian</h3>
<p>Falsely Reported Facts of Robbery of Gun; Weapon Has Been Certified by Pedestrian and Police Station</p>
<p>On the evening of the 4th of this month at around 9:00 PM, eight bandits occurred at the Talu Road Traffic Road Railway crossing in Zhabei, snatching the firearms of the railway police officer stationed there, causing the police to open fire and accidentally hit a pedestrian, Yang Yongfa, in the right leg. It was reported in the newspapers that the injured person was immediately sent to the hospital. It is now learned that at 9:00 PM that evening, when the Beijing-Shanghai Line express train arrived in Beijing, it was necessary to block pedestrians with a gate to prevent danger. When the gate had not yet been closed, several pedestrians wanted to cross the railway. The traffic police officer named Lin Mutai did not allow it, causing a conflict. In order to protect himself, the police officer fired a shot, unexpectedly hitting a pedestrian, Yang Yongfa, in the right leg. The injured person was immediately sent to the Tongren Hospital in the concession for treatment by the railway authorities. Fortunately, the injury was not fatal and there was no danger to life. At the time of this unfortunate incident, Zhao Guanying, the police officer at Post 38 of the Taiyang Temple Police Station of the Xinzha Branch Bureau, witnessed the incident at the gate on the north side of the railway and assisted in detaining two pedestrians, Zhou Hongji, i.e., Zhou Hongji, who confessed after interrogation that he was a 38-year-old Hunanese who lived at No. 3 Jiu'anli (i.e., the west side of the Taiyang Temple Police Station) on Jiaotong Road and made a living selling toothbrushes. It was verified by the patrol officer Pang Guiling that Zhou had a wife and two daughters. Zhou Hongji claimed that he was eager to return home for dinner, so he wanted to cross the railway and claimed that he was slapped in the face by the railway police officer and hit in the right thigh with the butt of a rifle, and showed bruises as evidence. However, the railway police officer knew that he had caused trouble and wanted to shirk responsibility, so he falsely reported that bandits had snatched the firearms and pointed to Zhou Hongji as a bandit, trying to bring Zhou to the railway bureau for interrogation, but the police station refused. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Xinzha Branch Bureau and then to the Police Headquarters.</p>

<h3>Child Endures Abuse by Elderly Woman, Escapes</h3>
<p>Investigation Reveals Abuse, Elderly Woman Sentenced</p>
<p>Zhu Tingxiang, an eleven-year-old girl from Ningbo, came to Shanghai with her sister, Fang Zhu, after her mother passed away last July, due to poverty. They received thirty yuan and placed her as an adopted daughter with Tao Zhang, an elderly woman from Shaoxing, at No. 62, Lane 828, Huade Road. Initially, the treatment was good, but recently, if Zhu made a slight mistake in her work, she would be brutally beaten with a bamboo pole, leaving her covered in wounds. On the 15th of last month, at 6 PM, Tao Zhang beat the girl again and locked her in a small room without food.

<h3>Japanese Merchants in Hongkou Oppose the Establishment of Osaka Department Store</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language "Mainichi Shimbun," the famous Osaka Daimaru Department Store, in order to develop in this city, has acquired the Bigo-ya foreign firm at No. 201, Peng Road, and is scheduled to start business on July 1. Japanese merchants in this city believe that Daimaru has huge capital. If it enters this city, small retailers in Hongkou will be greatly threatened. They are currently gathering merchants to oppose the construction. However, Daimaru has already sent Manager Yoshimura and Business Director Katayama to Shanghai to prepare for the opening. According to Trade Director Hoshijima, Daimaru's establishment in Shanghai is not mainly for retail, but focuses on exports to Nanyang and Africa. The initial investment is only 300,000 yuan, with future plans for development. However, the Japanese community believes that even without a store in Shanghai, Daimaru can directly trade with Nanyang and Africa. Instead of establishing a large company on Nanjing Road to compete with foreign department stores, it is establishing a store in the Japanese-populated area of Hongkou, which hinders the business of Japanese merchants. Therefore, small stores will jointly send representatives to Osaka to oppose the establishment.</p>

In the steerage cabin, they encountered a middle-aged woman with bound feet, holding a four or five-year-old boy. Suspecting their behavior, they questioned them separately.

He also said that the floral cloth shirt and running shoes he was wearing were given to him by the woman.

The Water Police Station was notified and sent Detective Xu Juelu to report to the local court. Prosecutor Zhong was commissioned to come to the bureau and inspect the body, finding that it was a cross-sectional wound that had not yet healed, leading to the misunderstanding.

Since no relatives could be found, the bureau was ordered to prepare the body for burial pending claim.</p>

<h3>Formulation and Implementation of International Labor Conventions (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Haifeng</p>
<p>After a member state ratifies a convention, it must be effectively implemented. If it fails to enact laws or regulations or use other methods to make the convention effective, the country's labor unions or employers' organizations can complain to the International Labor Office. The Governing Body may notify the accused government of the complaint and request it to submit a defense. If the government fails to submit a defense within a reasonable period or if the defense is insufficient, the Governing Body may publish the complaint and the defense, subjecting it to the criticism of world opinion. Any member state that believes that another member state has not effectively implemented the conventions ratified by each other has the right to file a complaint with the International Labor Office. All such complaints shall be handled by the Review Committee.</p>
<p>The drafting of convention proposals is the central task of the International Labor Organization, but we cannot say that the International Labor Organization is merely an agency for formulating international labor legislation. The current major economic and social problems require the attention and resolution of the International Labor Organization. In this era of transition, various economic forces must be adjusted. What countries feel they need now is how to establish a new economic equilibrium system to reduce the current crisis and depression and bring the world to peace and prosperity. However, this problem is very broad and includes international trade, fair competition, trade of goods and labor, and international adjustment of financial values. Therefore, the establishment of a new economic equilibrium system is the biggest international problem and cannot be achieved solely by the individual efforts of countries. International cooperation with sincerity is sufficient to restore the world's economic order. This task cannot be completed in the short term, because there is no shortcut to international economic recovery. In recent years, the world situation has shown signs of recovery, the number of unemployed workers has gradually decreased, and the lives of workers have improved slightly, but there are still many reforms that need to be implemented to reach the period of prosperity. The realization of this kind of enterprise can only be completed according to the method of democracy, through free discussion and free thought or open agreements caused by conflicts of interest. This democratic method is used by the International Labor Organization to assist in the construction of a new economic and social order. The draft conventions and recommendations formulated in the past are based on objective needs and are made in a democratic way. Its implementation will permanently and universally improve the labor conditions of all countries in the world. Only after the improvement of workers' lives can world peace and prosperity be maintained. Therefore, the efforts of the International Labor Organization to protect labor legislation are not limited to improving the status of workers, but are based on social justice and aim to build universal international peace.</p>
<h3>After Liang Tongfang's Suicide Attempt, He Expresses Efforts to Strive</h3>
<p>And Acknowledges the Suicide Attempt Was a Mistake</p>
<p>After the patriotic Liang Tongfang attempted suicide by taking poison and was rescued, all parties were concerned and went to comfort him. Mr. Liang specifically explained the error of his suicide yesterday, saying, "My suicide has aroused criticism from all parties. Among the many criticisms, there are sincere concerns, severe condemnations, and sincere comfort. I have no room for hesitation other than absolutely accepting and thanking them with all my heart. However, for the sake of many friends and advanced people from all walks of life, I am very ashamed to reveal everything today after surviving the disaster. I admit that I am a person who lacks understanding, and emotions are more important than reason in all aspects. This suicide attempt was certainly the result of a lack of reason. In my initial intention, when internal contradictions and conflicts were unsolvable, only suicide might fundamentally cut off my painful tongue. Pain that cannot express the stigmatized heart of being slandered, however, the facts tell me that this suicide is wrong, only aggravating my sins, now I am clear from now on, I will never commit suicide again, I realize that suicide is not the only way I will do my best after the disaster I will do a good job of actively saving people's lives, I know my abilities are subtle and weak, but I am now determined to live, I sincerely swear, I will live, I will reject negative ideas in the future, and decide to work hard in the field of domestic products, for the future of the Chinese nation, to do my part as a member of the Chinese nation. I hope that advanced people from all walks of life, and enthusiastic friends, forgive my past, although my pure heart has been torn by the claws of the devil, I know that in this dark blow, I must be brave and restore my original appearance, I sincerely hope here that advanced people and friends from all walks of life will give me severe supervision, I am willing to piously accept all criticisms and instructions, and at the same time, I bow with a ashamed heart to express my infinite thanks, to all the advanced people and friends who care about me."</p>

<h3>Silk Cocoon Business</h3>
<p>— Lu Ping</p>
<p>"The Dafeng Fresh Cocoon Business is approved to open its doors on June 1."</p>
<p>Money has obviously been lively these days, even the tea houses and dim sum shops are much more lively than usual.</p>
<p>"The cocoon business has opened!"</p>
<p>"Oh, the cocoon business has opened, the families with cocoons to sell are so happy!"</p>
<p>"The silkworm season this year is not good, the price of cocoons will probably be more expensive!"</p>
<p>"The price of mulberry leaves is too expensive. If the cocoons don't sell for 50 yuan, it will be a loss."</p>
<p>Recently, on the streets, in the alleys, no matter men, women, old or young, as long as they meet, everyone will talk to each other about that issue. However, those with cocoons to sell are happy, while those without cocoons to sell are sighing. Some women are even crying because they lost money raising silkworms, and half a year's life has been in vain.</p>
<p>That row of white walls on the market has already been whitewashed and repaired. The four large characters "Dafeng Cocoon Business" are particularly spirited. The wooden fence door has been opened. In addition to the original shed in front of the door, a reed mat shed of about 20 feet has been temporarily built, extending all the way to the small river. The cocoon rooms inside have already been cleaned up, and the drying stoves in the cocoon drying room have also been arranged neatly. Those "local squires" are also busy there, going in and out.</p>
<p>On the outside pillars, like couplets in a temple, are pasted old-fashioned sayings such as "official silk cocoons and thin cocoon skin are not accepted."</p>
<p>On the morning of June 1st, the front of the Dafeng Cocoon Business was already crowded with cocoons in baskets. There were also many small boats loaded with cocoons in the river.</p>
<p>It's past eight o'clock, and the opening hasn't started yet. Looking in through the wooden fence door, it's quiet inside. Only a few coolies are arranging the carrying baskets and everything else needed.</p>
<p>"It's still not open yet, what a cocoon business master!"</p>
<p>At nine o'clock, two weighers came out and sat on the high stools. Everyone immediately rushed to send the cocoon baskets up. The coolies took them and poured them into the specially made large carrying basket. The "card watcher" first turned the cocoons over from top to bottom, then picked up a few with two fingers to pinch and see, before letting the coolie hang them on the scale hook. The weighers squinted their eyes at the balance beam, their hands blocking the weight, mechanically reporting the catties, taels, and price.</p>
<p>"Thirty catties, twelve yuan."</p>
<p>"Sir, twelve yuan is not enough."</p>
<p>"How much, this is not bargaining!"</p>
<p>"Add a little more!"</p>
<p>"Oh! Twelve yuan and two jiao..."</p>
<p>"Not selling, at least fifteen yuan!"</p>
<p>"Pour it back, pour it back!"</p>
<p>So, the weigher went to weigh another carrying basket. The villager had to drag the carrying basket over, pour the flattened cocoons back into his own basket! Discouraged, he picked it up, muttering, and walked out of the cocoon business door.</p>
<p>"Lying ghosts, fifty yuan a dan (hundred catties), thirty catties of good and firm</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The cocoon can not even sell for fourteen yuan, these big</p>
<p>Old bugs only know how to exploit the villagers, people don't need to buy mulberry leaves for money</p>
<p>Bought. Alas, I won't sell unless it's fifty yuan, I'd rather go back</p>
<p>Draw silk".</p>
<p>But when a cocoon-selling woman squeezed out of the crowd</p>
<p>Out of time, I don’t know who is whispering there</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>"Hey! After all, it's about friendship, A Bao's wife</p>
<p>Twenty-five catties of thin clothing head cocoon are also worth fifteen ocean yuan!"</p>
<p>"Who said you didn't go to worship a cocoon business weigher</p>
<p>A dry son!"</p>
<p>The outside is still crowded with people, cocoon baskets are busy</p>
<p>The empty baskets and coupons are handed in from the railing</p>
<p>Delivered, the cocoons were carried by the porters into the cocoon room,</p>
<p>The coupon was exchanged for legal tender at the small window, so the villagers</p>
<p>Looking at the legal tender and thinking: pay debts, redeem items, the remaining money</p>
<p>Can be used as a seed money for farming. The cocoon business owner also looked at the cocoons in</p>
<p>Thinking: Today's situation can steadily earn ten yuan per hundred catties of dry cocoons</p>
<p>, If the goods are as crowded in the afternoon,</p>
<p>It can also reduce five yuan per dan, assuming that this city can</p>
<p>Receive two thousand dans, then twelve thousand yuan cannot be blown by the wind</p>
<p>, and can't be beaten away by rain.</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock, the inside shouted: "Stop weighing</p>
<p>, come again in the afternoon"! The wooden fence door was then closed</p>
<p>go up.</p>
<p>However, in the afternoon, the price of cocoons dropped by five yuan per hundred catties</p>
<h3>Fishing Boats</h3>
<p>— Guo Bian</p>
<p>The setting sun, adorned with rosy clouds, hid behind Wanshi Mountain. The accumulated snow on the mountain peaks emitted a crystalline light, as if struggling to resist the sun's violent rays. The sea had already spread into the desolate woods, and the bare branches swayed restlessly. The village was filled with noise, livestock were calling, the shrill sound of "jiaoma che" (a type of cart) rang out, children were crying and clamoring. Everything was unsettled, like this every day! Only the pair of tall, silver-topped flagpole at the front of the "Guandi Temple" stood silently, reaching into the sky. People worked incessantly, twisting straw ropes, mending fishing nets, weaving mats, and knotting the straw rope nets in preparation for catching sea cucumbers in the early autumn. Even the children were not allowed to play idly. Adults gave them some dried fish or dried "shrimp meat" to sort, separating the good from the bad.</p>
<p>Before the sun had even set, they ate dinner, and the fishermen went out to sea to fish. Numerous boats moved across the boundless sea like moths. The "lighthouse" between the mountain capes began to emit light. The sails were filled by the wind, like the belly of a pregnant woman. They shouted, not out of fear of the turbulent waves, but because of their accustomed way of life. They always shouted while working, just as workers driving piles must sing.</p>
<p>By the time they reached their destination, the night had already engulfed the sea. They discovered mechanized fishing boats, and the sound of the machines clearly entered their eardrums. Everyone was surprised. There had never been mechanized fishing boats in the "Sangdao" area. Qingdao and Weihai had mechanized fishing boats, but "Sangdao" would not have them.</p>
<p>Net after net, cast after cast, came up empty. Where had all the fish gone? The mechanized fishing boat in the distance was approaching, running fiercely east and west, scaring all the fish away. In the darkness, one could not see the mechanized fishing boat with only the faint light of fishing lamps. Helpless, they left and headed for a more distant location.</p>
<p>As they began to work, the hateful fishing boat chased after them again. It was probably deliberately trying to cause trouble. The fishermen were furious, and their fishing boats moved forward together to surround the fishing boat.</p>
<p>"Whose fishing boat is this?" one fisherman asked angrily.</p>
<p>There was no response from the fishing boat. The person managing the machinery paid them no attention.</p>
<p>"We're telling you to leave! Mechanized fishing boats are not allowed to fish in the Sangdao waters, do you hear? Leave immediately!"</p>
<p>The response from the fishing boat was:</p>
<p>"We are the fishing boat of ××! Who dares to tell us to leave?"</p>
<p>After a burst of laughter, followed a rude remark.</p>
<p>The fishermen were dejected and left the fishing boat, steering their own boats elsewhere. It was better to avoid them!</p>
<p>"Treading on our heads, bullying us too much!" Just as the fishermen began to work, the fishing boat came again, running around and preventing the fish from entering their nets. But their own fishing boat caught net after net of fish. It was truly unbearable to endure this humiliation! Suddenly, one fisherman took out a "rifle" from the rear cabin. They usually carried rifles to defend against pirates! With a gunshot, the other fishermen also took up their rifles and fired at the fishing boat!</p>
<p>Victory! The fishing boat fled as fast as it could! The fishermen worked happily until dawn.</p>
<p>The next day, on the "Sangdao" sea, more ××'s mechanized fishing boats were discovered, one, two, three… seven or eight with sun symbols. As soon as they saw the Chinese fishermen's boats, they opened fire with guns and cannons. The "Sangdao" sea immediately became a battlefield! The fishermen retreated! They were heading to new places to open up new fishing areas!</p>
<p>Every day, a large number of ××'s mechanized fishing boats fished in the Sangdao sea. No one dared to offend them. The fishermen were angry but dared not speak. Talk.</p>
<p>Talk.</p>
<h3>Storing Strength Movement</h3>
<p>— Zhao Menglan</p>
<p>The Youth Association has recently launched a "Storing Strength Movement." According to a staff member of the Youth Association, "This is just a promotion; whether or not to implement it is up to the public to decide." The strength to be stored is divided into four categories: self-confidence and self-esteem, doing one's best to assist the country's construction undertakings (mental strength); exercising for 15 minutes daily (physical strength); having a skill (intellectual strength); and saving at least one cent per day (material strength). Regarding the "Storing Strength Movement," the Youth Association stipulates that there is a lot of work to be done regularly in the future. As a beginning, the "Storing Strength Movement Exhibition," which serves as a promotion for the promotion, has already held its opening ceremony on the fourth.</p>
<p>That "strength" needs to be "stored" shows that we have wasted "strength" in the past. That "storing strength" needs to be "promoted" and even become a "movement" shows even more how we have been wasting "strength" in the past, or, simply, destroying the growth of strength. The chairman's speech at the opening ceremony of the Storing Strength Exhibition stated: "Therefore, the size of a country's land and the number of its people should be directly proportional to the strength of its national power. If they are sometimes not directly proportional, but instead inversely proportional, it is roughly due to two reasons: ㊀ failure to concentrate the entire power of the country; ㊁ for example, the self-destruction of warlords in the past, which unnecessarily consumed the entire power of the country." This is well said. And our past has been exactly these "two reasons," especially the latter, which has caused so many "man-made disasters" and man-made "natural disasters"!</p>
<p>And when there are natural disasters and man-made disasters, one is too busy fleeing for their lives, so where would there be time to store strength? Mayor Yu said in "Storing Strength and National Rejuvenation": "No nation has ever constantly engaged in the destruction of its own strength and been able to avoid destruction and demise. A tree is not broken by a storm but destroyed by蛀蝕(zhu shi: woodworm or internal decay), the reason for which can be deeply considered"! This is truly something to "deeply consider."</p>
<p>But besides this, there are other things to "deeply consider."</p>
<p>I can't remember which gentleman said, "Useful talents are mostly in prison." If this sentence is to be interpreted, then it is the first reason of the "roughly two reasons": "failure to concentrate the entire power of the country." The basis for "failure to concentrate the entire power of the country" has already been said by someone at the opening of the Storing Strength Movement Exhibition: "The entire power of the country lies dormant in every member of the public. If used well, this dormant power can be expressed and developed; if not used well, this dormant power can also be wasted and destroyed for no reason." And "storing" "talents" (that is, excellent strength) in prison is precisely wasting and destroying dormant power for no reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, "we should not be complacent that the country is unified and national power is concentrated, thinking that any difficulties can be dealt with in the future. We should also pay attention to whether the dormant power in each person can be expressed? Can it be developed?" "If their good strength is not buried and wasted, then making the strength of 450 million people the entire strength of the country will naturally allow us to compete with the great powers of the world."</p>
