<p>［南京］林主席十八日晨在國府建都南京十週年紀念會致詞、題為“十年來之民生建設”原文如次、</p>
<p>省察過去　今天是國民政府奠都南京十週年的紀念日，我們今天舉行這個紀念會、我想最大的意義、是在省察我們十年來的工作成績、從前曾夫子講過吾日三省吾身、我覺得我們個人固然應該每日三省吾身、就是政府也應該常常省察過去的設施、是不是都今於福國利民的原則、有沒有應做而不做、或不應做而做的事情、所以我們今天在這個紀念會中、應該把政府十年來所做的工作提出來報告一下、一方面作我們自己的檢查、作我們自己的省察、一方面亦是向全國國民作一個十年來的工作報告、國民政府十年來所做的工作、頭緒很多、我們在這個短時間的中間、當然不能作很詳細的報告、總理在建國大綱上面告訴我們、建國之首要在民生、民生的四大需要、是食衣住行、我們今天就把政府十年來關於全國國民的食衣住行方面所做的工作、提出來作一個簡單的報告、</p>
<p>食的方面　我國自古以農立國、關於食的方面、本來出產很富、國內所產的各種糧食、不但足夠自給、並且還常常有餘、可是近幾十年來、因為世界農業技術的進步、我國的農業、就不免相形見絀、加以盜匪竄擾、閭閻不安、農村大有瀕於破產之勢、政府有鑒於此、所以年來對於救濟農村的工作、異常努力、而對於農業技術的改進、尤特別予以注意、關於農業改進方面、設立有中央農業實騐所、及全國稻麥改進所等等、關於農業推廣方面、設立有中央模範農業推廣區、及烏江農業推廣實騐區等等、關於救濟農村經濟方面、設立有中央模範倉庫、現有專倉五所、分倉三百餘所、最近中央為調整農業產品、流通農村資金、以謀全國農村經濟的發達起見、由實業部聯合國內各銀行組織農本局、固定資金三千萬元、由政府分年籌撥、合放資金三千萬元、由參加各銀行合繳、流通資金額數、由參加各銀行與農本局協定、現已組織成立、正在積極經營、我們預料將來對於發達農村經濟方面所收的成效，一定非常偉大、以上是政府近年來關於食的方面所做的工作、</p>
<p>衣的方面　其次關於衣的方面、可分作兩部份講、一部分是農業部分、一部分是工業部分、在農業部分、上面所講的、農業改進•農業推廣•及救濟農村經濟等等、大部分都與衣的方面有連帶關係、此外為設立蠶絲改良委員會、改進正定棉業試驗塲、對於植桑製種育蠶植棉等等、都分別研究、力謀改良、為時雖短、而都已收有相當的成效、這是政府對於衣的方面關於農業部分所做的工作、在工業部分、如設立棉業統制委員會、集中權力、澈底謀棉業的改善、以及獎勵紡織業、救濟繅絲業、提倡毛織物工業等等、其目的都是在增加工業方面的大量生產、這是政府對於衣的方面關於工業部分所做的工作、</p>
<p>住的方面　第三講到住的方面、亦有一點重要的報告、我國在未曾通商以前、自己亦有很好的建築，亦有很偉大的宮室、所用的磚瓦木料、都是取材於國內的、可是到了近幾十年來、關於建築方面的材料、很多的採用舶來品、把本國固有的材料、棄置不用、以至國家的入超與日俱進、政府有鑒於此、所以近年來對於建築方面、竭力提倡採用本國材料、中國本來有很好的木料、現在經政府提倡之後、木商亦把這種木材做成起口板、較之外貨旣廉且美、最近各地方的建築、都紛紛採用此項國貨材料、這實在是中國建築方面一個很大的進步、此外有磚瓦的製造、中國本來進步很快、五金與水泥方面、中國亦稍稍有些出品、可惜數量太少、不敷供給、現在實業部正在辦理鋼鐵廠、將來大批出貨之後、對於建築材料方面、一定亦有很大的帮助、</p>
<p>行的方面　第四講到行的方面、政府在這個方面所做的工作、此較最多一點、可分作四部分來講、第一鐵道部分、十年來新築的鐵道、業己完成通車的、有粵漢路的株韶段、有隴海路的西段•及港務段•與臺趙支綫•有蘇嘉路•浙贛路•江南路•淮南路•及同蒲路幹支綫、共長二千七百五十四公里、正在建築中的、有杭曹路•南萍路•宣衢路•湘黔路•共長一千七百九十公里、其他如二十二年九月間竣工的首都輪渡、二十四年年底竣工的連雲港、二十三年十一月興工本年夏季可以竣工的錢塘江大鐵橋、都是與鐵道有連帶關係的鉅大工程、第二公路部分、民國十六年以前、國內公路建設、零星簡陋、鮮有成績可言、政府奠都南京之後、交通鐵道兩部、先後規盡國道幹支各綫系統、及工程標準、公路的建設、才正式開始進行、二十年十一月，全國經濟委員會籌備處成立之後、卽首先從事督造各省聯絡公路、由蘇浙皖三省擴充至蘇浙皖贛湘鄂豫七省、廿二年該會正式成交、對於各省聯絡公路、重行通盤籌畫、撥借基金、繼續興修、陝甘閩青各省及贛粵閩邊各重要路綫、亦陸續列入督造範圍、先後修築西蘭、西漢•漢寗•各路、最近京滇公路亦已直接通車、總計全國公路、業已完成的、有十萬零九千七百四十九公里、正在建築中的、有一萬六千一百六十五公里、業經測量完畢卽將開工的、有四萬五千九百七十九公里、總計有十七萬一千八百九十三公里的公路、不久卽可以完全通車、這不能不說是我國交通方面一個顯著的進步、第三航政方面、我國航業、原甚幼稚、經近年積極整理之後、已日見進步、如改組招商局、改良航務管理、改善航運辦法、增加航行速率、提倡航業合作等等、都收獲相當的成效、今後主管機關再能繼續加以注意與努力、將來我國的航業、當不難與外航並駕齊驅、第四民用航空方面、自中國航空公司與歐亞航空公司相繼成立之後、截至二十五年年底、中國的航空綫、已增至十四條路綫、總長一萬七千八百公里、兩公司常用的飛機有二十四架、乘客人數在十九年度祇有二千六百五十四人、至廿四年度已增至一萬零四百零四人、乘客飛行的路程、在十九年度祇百零二萬七千九百零二公里、至廿四年度已增至五百八十五萬七千一百零三公里、由此推算、在數年之後、中國的航空綫、當可普及全國、以上是政府十年來關於行的方面所做的工作、</p>
<p>努力將來　上面所報告的是單就食衣往行方面而言、此外如礦產的開發、林懇的推廣、水利的興修、郵電的改進、以及長途電話普遍佈設於全國的重要城市、這都與民生建設有關、亦都是建設新中國的基本工作、因此一般人認為中國在這十年中間、似乎已經有了很大的進步、但是我們自己一想、覺得距離我們所希望的程度尚遠、總理在建國方略上講、全國要築十萬里鐵道、一百萬里石子路、現在我們才築了萬多里的鐵道、十幾萬里的公路、不過才做了總理所講的十分之一二、其他沒有做到十分之一二的還多、今後我們應該怎樣的自勉、怎樣的努力、來完成我們要做的工作、應盡的責任、我想我們今天參加這個紀念會、一定都有這種同樣的感想、我們今後祗有與全國國民共同努力共同來完成我們建設新中國的使命、（十八日中央社電）</p>

<p>［東京］日日新間今日繼續以最顯著之地位、載一消息、謂我國將促請英美等國組織太平洋集體安全保障制度、題為一反對吾人之大陸政策斷然不能容許”，據該報意見、此種制度之設置、終將威脅日本國家生存權之行施、故日本應自始至終堅持予以排擊之决心等語、上述消息、使人感覺為無的放矢、或國際間之挑釁云，（十八日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>蘇聯造艦與美軍演戰</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>自從日本宣布廢止華盛頓條約。到去年年底正式生效以來。太平洋上的形勢。已陷於無條約的狀態。就現狀看。新條約的訂立。似乎渺不可期。於是大規模的海軍競爭。便逐漸發動起來。在過去二三月中。英國海軍曾在南太平洋接連的舉行演習。而且决定以巨額經費。增築新加坡與香港的防禦工事。現在蘇聯也有了加速增建戰艦的計劃。而美國海空軍更在夏威夷羣島附近。舉行着空前大規模的演戰了。</p>
<p>這種種海軍競爭的活動。我們要知道。都是隨着某方面的侵略野心而發展的。日本在太平洋上採取着南北並進的政策。日本軍閥已經把整個的財政經濟機構放在“準戰時體制”的基礎上。這樣自然引起了太平洋上各國緊急戒備的行動。所以這種軍事活動的增加。一方面固然表現着世界大战的危機的迫近。另一方面也顯示着各國都在準備實力。以抵制日本的威脅。</p>
<p>這次蘇聯的增造戰艦。在太平洋的局勢中。實有重大的意義。蘇聯的海軍力本來是微弱的。但是近年來由於日德的加緊威脅。蘇聯於完成東西邊境的陸軍防禦工事之後。也開始注意到海軍的力量了。去秋英蘇海軍協定成立。英國承認蘇聯在遠東有斟酌情形而擴充海軍之權。乃是這次蘇聯增造戰艦的先聲。從那時以後。蘇聯一面趕造潛水艇。完成海岸防禦的第一步。一面積極開關北極航路。使波羅的海與白海的艦隊。可以迅速調遣至遠東。據前月倫敦“每日電聞”所載。現在蘇聯的潛艇力量。在波羅的海有九十艘。在海參歲有四十艘已佔世界的第一位。這一步成功之後。它又進一步計劃增築巨型的戰艦了。</p>
<p>美國海空軍在夏威夷一帶的演戰。近年來是常常舉行的。但這次參加演戰的有軍艦一百三十九艘。演戰節圍達二百萬方哩。可說是美國際史上最大規樓的演戰。這樣大規模演戰的示威的作用。是很顯明的。記得在前年美國海軍的大演戰中。有一種祕密文件被某方間諜竅去。因此演戰突然中止。去年美國破獲海軍間諜案。又牽連到許多日本人。所以這次美國海空軍的演戰。對於艦隊的編制。完全保守着秘密。從這點上。也可以看出美國海軍在太平洋上與日本尖銳對立的形勢。</p>
<p>這次蘇聯的增建戰艦。據傳有與美法兩國接洽。希望獲得它們在工程上幫助的計劃。而美法則因種種關係。已加以拒絕。這消息的傳出。我們覺得也顯然有對日示威。使它在海軍競爭上讓步的意思。在美蘇之間。並沒有軍事上的衝突。血祇有利害的一致。法蘇之間。更不必說。最近美國派往倫敦的特使台維斯也與蘇聯駐美大使格斯基會晤。談到海軍上的問題。這表示美蘇的海軍合作。仍有相當的可能。假如這一步能雊實現。則對於日本的侵略野心。當是一個很大的壓力。對於遠東的整個局勢。也是很有益的。</p>

<p>新加坡通訊、孔特使•陳副使•一行二十七人、此次奉命代表中國政府慶賀英王加冕記者亦得機會隨行、現在把沿途的見聞摘要寫出、以告國人、</p>
<p>特使團此次所乘的艦、是義輪維多利亞號原來定於四月二日正午十二點鐘開行的可是因為到輪來與孔特使話別的人太多、所以延到下午兩點才開行、維多利亞號的設備是狠完善的、加以沿途風平浪靜、所以大家都很感到舒適、第二天的下午、孔特使在船上召集同行的人、開了一次談話會、分配工作、並且指示大家此行應當注意的幾點、同行的人、有許多是以前沒有會面過的、但在船上、大家談笑的機會狠多、不到兩天、彼此都為了要好的朋友了、</p>
<p>四日早晨十點、船就到了香港、香港總督、因在鄉下休息、特別派了輔政司史密斯、前來迎接、此外本地的紳士、以及從廣州來的軍政各界代表、到碼頭歡迎的不下數百人孔特使等、先由史密斯陪乘港督小輪、直赴督轅、略行休息、便赴伺東爵士的宴會、席間何東爵士舉杯、慶祝中華民國萬歲、孔特使亦舉杯、慶祝英王萬歲以為報、何東爵士盛稱孔特使過去政績、並祝孔特使此行之更能鞏固中英邦交、孔特使答詢、略謂此行專為慶祝英王加冕、但在典禮完畢後、希望到各國游歷、參觀各項經濟建設、以為建設新中國之參考、又謂香港與中國大陸聯結、自粵漢鐵路通車後、關係益為密切、以後中英友誼的增進、香港應為重要之一圖云、陳副使因同時有英駐遠東海軍司令李德爾歡宴所以在何東爵土家中、略坐卽行辭去、當日下午、還有兩處茶會、一為華僑四十餘團體組織的歡送孔特使赴英大會、於下午四時在思豪酒店舉行、另為華商總會的歡送會、於下午五點舉行、兩次孔特使均有演說、大意謂過去十餘年國民政府革命之成績、海內海外之廣東同胞、貢獻狠多、以後國家建設之工作很多、希望廣東同胞仍繼續以往的精神為國家努力對於華商總會孔特使尤冉三敦囑、略謂中國已日趨於工業化、工業製造品之出路、須靠商人、商人開關銷路、然後工業有辦法、工業有辦法、農民的生活程度、也可增高、過去香港商會、對於推銷國貨、已有成績、以後尤當盡力、孔特使演講時、極為誠懇、聽者均為動容、報以熱烈的掌聲、四日、香港各華報、均以大字登載特使消息、並著有社論、歡送赴英特使國、維多利亞號、亦卽於當日下午八時左右離港、</p>

<p>六日早上七點我們的船、便到了馬尼拉政府代表•黨部及華商的代表、擠滿了船上的會客廳、我們都是來歡迎孔特使的、我們先生早已預備好的汽車、繞市走了一週南國的風光、到底與溫帶的地方不同千紅萬紫、觸目皆是、領導我們參觀的人說、這是人間天上、</p>
<p>略為遊覽之後、我們便去參加國民黨總支部的茶會、孔特使知道菲律濱的僑胞、一定很願意知道最近國內各種建設的消息、所以便乘這個機會、把數年來公路及鐵路航空等方面的建設、略加申述、同時特別指出中國數年的建設、在蔣院長領導之下、是物質與精神同時並進的、精神方面的建設、便是新生活運動、最後謂在菲僑胞除在本地發展事業之外、應念念不忘祖國、中國歷年均有入超問題、但未損傷國家元氣、最重要的原因、便是得利於華僑匯欵、卽此一端、可見華僑對於祖國的貢獻、中國現正在建設之路上前進、華僑對於人力及財力兩方面、均可為祖國効力云云、茶會後、卽赴美國駐菲最高專員、及菲總統在總統府舉行的香檳會十二點赴駐菲中華總領事館及中華商會在馬尼刺旅館舉行的歡宴會席間孔特使謂中菲友誼素稱和洽、菲律賓獨立中國政府極表同情、中國為愛好和平之國家、中國强盛不為菲律賓之碍、而為菲律賓之助以後兩國在商業上、在文化上、應亙相合作、以謀遠東之和平云、此次宴會、本地政學商各界代表到者甚多、對於孔特使之演詞、均同聲謂佩、</p>
<p>在馬尼拉停留的時間不多、除了正式的宴會之外、私人的應酬也不少、這一次同行的人、姓陳的共有三位、除了陳副使之外、還有陳炳章與陳立廷二先生、馬尼刺的陳氏宗祠、便把他們三位都請去、攝影、題安、吃茶馬尼刺的國貨進口商會主席桂榮山先生、在我們的同行中找到了桂永清武官、大喜過望、因為姓桂的根本就很少、他們兩位同宗、難得又在海外相逢、所以招待得特別殷勤卽此一點、可見兩胞雖然遠離祖國、但對於祖國的人情風俗、還是戀戀不捨的、</p>

<h3>公共租界電車工人昨晨罷工各路停駛</h3>
<p>因新條件公司未允卽行談判　黨政澈查定今日商處置辦法</p>
<p>大公社云、公共租界英商電車公司車務機務兩部工人、因新提要求條件五項、經黨政一再調處公司不予接受、乃於昨晨六時起宣佈罷工、各路有無軌電車一律停駛、捕房派探捕嚴密警備、黨政當局會商處置辦法、將先勸導復工、靜候調處、分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>談判决裂</p>
<p>電車工人要求條件原為五項、曾經市黨部社會局派員一再邀集勞資雙方談判、除退職金問題已解决外、其餘各條伴、則因意見懸殊、無法解决、工方為表示讓步、及宣告祇堅持、㊀機務部工人每月升工兩天、㊁開車工人、每月做滿二十五天增加升工一天、（連前兩天共三天）資方亦不予接受、該公司總經理伊文、並聲明卽將出國、請將工人條件延至六個月後再談、工方表示不能接受、談判乃告决裂、</p>
<p>聯合罷工</p>
<p>談判决裂後、工人乃於前晚召開緊急代表會議議决、定昨晨一律罷工、故昨晨六時起、該公司所有有軌電車、（一路）靜安寺至公園靶子塲、（二路）靜安寺至十六舖、（三路）麥根路至東新橋、（四路）善鐘路至提籃橋、（五路）法商電車原由老西門至北車站、現因公共租界電車罷工、已縮短路綫、由老西門至東新橋、（六路）圓路、（七路）北火車站至提籃橋、（八路）楊樹浦至十六舖、（十二路）靜安寺至提籃橋、無軌電車、（十四路）民國路至北火車站（十五路）、三洋涇橋至岳州路、（十六路）曹家渡至民國路（十七路）打浦橋至蘭路、昆明路、（十八路）斜橋至岳州路、（十九路）民國路至小沙渡、（二十路）靜安寺至兆豐公園、（二十一路）戈登路至平凉路、各路車輛、一律停駛、至法租界有軌四路、五路電車、及四十七•十八•等各路無軌電車、亦一律暫不駛入公共租界</p>
<p>黨政處置</p>
<p>自各路電車停駛後、市面交通、極感不便、各路公共汽車則乘客突然擁擠、黨政當局、認為長此僵持、不獨勞資雙方蒙受損失、且妨害社會尤屬重大、故除派員調查罷工詳情外、决定今晨會商處置辦法、將勸令工人先行復工、以謀妥善處理、聞資方表示可以讓步、而工人則以此次罷工為第三次、堅持非達到目的、决不復工、故工潮前途如何、殊堪重視云云</p>
<p>捕房戒備</p>
<p>自公共租界電車工人提出五項條件後、捕房方面、為防患未然、由政治部派員密切注意談判之趨向、自昨日工潮再度爆發後、捕房為維持治安起見、立卽飭派大批探捕、至赫德路、匯山路、倍開爾路、各車廠、嚴密戒備、北蘇州路總公司、亦加派警探保護、惟工人方面、除覓定通訊地點、靜候消息外、均嚴守秩序、並無意外情事發生云、</p>
<p>今晨請願</p>
<p>電車工人、自實行聯台罷工後、因適值星期日、黨政機關曁公司均停止辦公、故雙方並未進行談判、工方為貫澈要求條件計、此次態度異常堅决、如不達目的、則不惜重大犧牲、惟為求糾紛早日解决、以免影響交通、特定今晨推代表楊兆餘等分赴市黨部、社會局、總工會、等各機關請願、要來賜予切實援助</p>

<h3>閘北水電公司昨開股東常會</h3>
<p>水電兩部份積極擴充　董事監察人任滿改選</p>
<p>商辦閘北水電公司、昨假寗波同鄉會、召集第十三屆股東常會、并合併召集第三次增資股東會、計到會股東二十五萬八千四百十五股、合二十三萬五千七百四十權、下午二時開會、公推樂振葆主席、宣告開會後、先由監察人報告增資情形、繼由總經理陸伯鴻報告業務狀况、其詞云、</p>
<p>本公司二十五年度業務、可區別為三個時期、上半年承去年各業凋敝之後、業務頗受影響甚至較二十四年份猶有遜色、此為徘徊時期、下半年市塲活動、各業猛進、工廠日夜開工、電力之需要、突然增加、此為發皇時期、而在秋季受地方謠諑之影響、冬初又有西安事變發生、居戶遷徏、工業需要减落、此為意外時期、一年間之變遷雖有不同、而精進之方針、始終如一、全年統計營業收入、尚較去年為高、此差可告慰於各股東者、</p>
<p>至水電兩部份業務與工程、亦可約略分別言之、水之需要、雖不能達到預期、然因去年需要量之增加、有超過水廠原有出水量之勢、不得不預為準備，故上年已定之水廠擴充工程、於三月初卽開始興工、計沉澱池一座、快濾池四座、水塔一座、九百公里幹管一路、在二十六年夏季以前、均可完全竣工、適應炎暑需要之增加、經此次擴充後、每日出水量可增加三萬六千餘立方公尺、而鑑於二十五年份業務狀况、自須推廣出路、以消納此新增之出水量、故决定擴充中山路給水、該處工廠林立、居戶漸增、預期排管給水以後、定可為業務增色不少、</p>
<p>電氣部份、在下半年因各工廠需要突增、最高負荷一躍而至二萬元九千餘瓩、幸上年决定之廣充工程、如期進行、新增之一萬四千瓩透平發電機一座、每小時產汽五十噸之鍋爐二座、以及其他設備、均於年底以前裝竣試用、得以應付需要之突然增加、不至臨時張皇無措、尚有鍋爐一座、須二十六年方能裝置、同時為推廣業務計、利用供電嘉豐紡織廠之桿綫、與嘉定華興永記電燈廠訂立合同、供給該廠用電、業已實行、而南翔生明電氣公司、由本公司饋電、接洽亦已成熟、並在滬西蒲淞區、擴充一新營華區域、已奉主管機關核准、地方之便利與公司之業務、交有利賴、惟電氣之需要、鑑於過去情形、有繼續增高之趨勢、故二十六年份、又决定第二步擴充電廠計劃、再添購一萬四千瓩透平發電機一座、已在進行中、預計第二步擴充完成、三四年中、可以從容應付、不致有竭蹶之虞、此水電兩部份業務與工程之大略情形也、</p>
<p>本公司以如此之努力、故能得政府之嘉獎、與投資人之信任、建設委員會頒給榮譽獎狀、至本屆為止、連得五年、而增加資本、每次順利進行、其第三次增資之一百萬元、業已如數收足、第二次發行之公司債券、亦招募足額、使公司經濟、得以穩固、惟本屆營業收入、雖較去年增加、嘏辨增老大部份皆屬電力、計費本極低廉、本屆又减低電價、故利潤較薄、本公司旣抱定輔助工商業之宗旨、自當具遠大目光、以與各業共趨繁榮之途、勿沾沾於小己之自利、當為各股東所樂許云云、</p>
<p>繼由監察人報告賬略、通過益餘分配、及修正章程兩案、最後選舉董事監察人、開票結果、陸伯鴻、施省之•錢新之•馮炳南•樂振葆•徐新六•王子崧•朱壽丞•陳煩謙•張雲搏•徐春榮•施丙之•朱孔嘉•陸子冬•沈聯芳•等十五人當選為董事、施博羣•王雲甫•徐乾麟•李濟生•劉聘三•等五人當選為監察人、至下午六時散會、並悉談公司二十五年份股息紅利、定於本年五月十日開始發給、</p>

<p>蠶葉之供</p>
<p>求尚能適應、本年則突飛猛晋、改良種子孵育、較去年增加十分之二、土種亦復稱是、而其關係飼料之桑葉、則逈非昔年之繁榮可比、一屆食葉旺汛、難免</p>

<h3>偽造名刺</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>不久之前，曾有這本一個“傻子”，偷了人家的東西，却自首到巡捕行裏去，要求吃官司，後來法官判他五十天的刑期，也却皺長眉頭來，認為刑期判得太少了。這個新聞在常人看來，眞是有點“滑稽”之感，然而在那個“傻子”本身，却是件解决衣食住人生三大問題的大事呵！</p>
<p>人們為了衣食往的三大問題，甘願去吃官司，甘願把自己的自由失却，似乎“不自由，母寗死”這法國式的戒條，到我們中國來（其實，可說現在全世界都是這樣的了，）却是失掉其神聖般的價值了。這是不是人們出於自願而不要自由呢？還不是為了要解决衣食住這人生的三大問題啊！</p>
<p>為了要解决這衣食住人生的三大問題，人世間不知有多少的人却犯了“罪”而得到可怕的“罰”呵！</p>
<p>“少年吳振民，因失業已久，忽異想天開，竟偽造蒋委員長名刺，於前晨赴市府求見俞鴻鈞，圖謀騙取職位•”偽造蔣委員長的名刺，吳某的胆量可不謂不太矣，又何况在名刺上以墨筆書有：“兪代市長，祈代來人安置市警察局職務”等字樣，這種“招搖撞騙，希圖不法，”其罪不可逭，眞是夫復何言了！然而畢竟因為“失業已久”，所以才這樣“異想天開”的來偽造蔣委員長的名刺，謀騙職位，以求生活之安定，其行為雖屬可恥亦可惡，可是其情也實屬可悲而可憫也。</p>
<h3>藥</h3>
<p>— 羅荃</p>
<p>風打着唿哨，緊密地把雨的點線吹打在坡璃窗上，吹打在屋前的破銅爛鐵上，響着古暗的叮咚。</p>
<p>我却在這樣狂暴的風雨中守望着一根顫顫欲斷的蛛絲。</p>
<p>壓倒了我的伙伴的不只是那沉重的病症，還有那過逝的一大堆日子裏累積下來的勞瘁。這麼，會醫治他的也不只是藥石，應該還有一些日子的調養。這在我的伙伴顯然是辦不到的。</p>
<p>記得是一個灰晦的黃昏，他雙手抱着頭踉蹌回來。便一語不發地倒身在被褥上，喊着頭痛，喊着口渴，還喊着血……接着啐在地板上的痰便嚇然多了一抹殷紅的顏色。</p>
<p>待走過去攙扶着他的時候，才發覺他的手背青筋像蚯蚓似地漲起，全無一點血色，身體發冷似地顫戰着。於是一陣恐怖的陰影襲上了我們的心，使我們感到空虚，使我們畏懼地相看着了。</p>
<p>便這樣地被沉重的病症壓倒了，而那多年累積下來的勞瘁使他變得更贏弱，使他的呼吸更飄渺，直像一根橫結在暴雨中的顫顫欲斷的蛛絲。</p>
<p>因為白天無意地在賣卜攤前擺下幾個戲謔的錢，却聽說他的病是一把撒在水裏的砂糖，會慢慢地兀自消融的。回来的時候，我不禁偸偸地看着昏睡中的他，一張蒼灰的臉，堆着難耐的痛苦似地，胸膛在蓋被下殫然無力地起伏着。我知道着那起伏是不均勻，而且困頓的</p>
<p>强調地亢進着的昏睡能雊摒除他的病痛嗎！日常粗淡的飲食能雊遏止他的殷紅的血絲嗎？</p>
<p>我不能袖手等待着，我不能啊！</p>
<p>那幾個錢換來的慰藉的話不足使我放心。我想那麼脆弱的生命綫也許一陣風一陣雨，便會吹斷也說不定。我不能而且也不忍袖手守望着他在痛楚中掙扎。</p>
<p>於是我便擠在一大羣憂患的人羣裏了。</p>
<p>我傾軋着其他心急的人，也被前前後後的人傾軋着，推擁着。我顧不了老弱，顾不了負看病痛的女人們。觉得自己是蹈到緊張的生死塲去搭教一個垂死的人，我急躁着，為的是替我的伙伴討求一帖好藥石。</p>
<p>我開始對小窗裏的那人说明了他的病狀。我說他現在是在痛苦着，在牀上打滾着，喊着頭痛，喊着口渴，而且他嗆嗽以後喀血。這些便是我所知道的一切了。</p>
<p>可是他的病狀委實不只這些。他被人呼喝，被人驅趕。他撕碎自己的皮肉，餐飲着自己的血和汗，他是牛馬一樣地活過來的。現在他是為病症和勞瘁所壓倒着，而我是為他而來的。</p>
<p>我要討一些藥。</p>
<p>那人問我他生的是什麼病。這正是我要質問他的，我還要去質問一切的人。</p>
<p>可是我能夠說些什麼呢？我要討求一些東西，只得低垂着頭，感到一些羞赧。像其他的人一樣，他門感到欣幸和無限的慰藉。</p>
<p>然而我終於激怒起來了。我要質問他生病的原因，我不但要為他討一些藥，而且還應該討回他那些被人剝奪了的一切。我用咆哮的聲調，是的，討回一些被剝奪了的東西，是用不着和氣的聲調的。</p>
<p>我心急，我憤恨，我跟小窗裏的那人無端地吵鬧起來了•我瘋狂似地槌着那口小鐵窗，想抓着那人和一切人的頭髪，把他們拖倒在地上，並且把他們頭髪撕掉。我呼喊着，揚着手臂，我蹦跳着，拳頭落在身邊的人的身上。</p>
<p>一個粗野的人跑過來給我重重的一拳，於是我們倒在地上，再也掙扎不起來。我用右手支起上半身，用仇視的眼光望着那個野種。</p>
<p>一些藥醫得好我的伙伴的病嗎？不能的。他的生活力是久被剝奪了。僅是一些藥於他的病也終是徒然。我想。</p>
<h3>槍聲</h3>
<p>— 羅鬱</p>
<p>當我到天津的第五天，冒着馳騁在街里的夾了塞北黃沙的風，搬到城西南的N校底宿舍里去。在忙着檢點行李的時候，我抽空望一下那南北的長街，想是不是已迷失在記憶後邊了。街底南端，空曠的土堤背後，風來回地狂奔迫逐着。而沙士也迷矇了左近的樓舍。</p>
<p>行人是很稀少的？連膠皮車也都躲到凹進的牆角里去：祇有一種特出的聲音，間或從南邊飄過來。</p>
<p>卜卜卜……</p>
<p>有些學生戴了風鏡或日本式的口罩很忽促地在街上穿過去。他們一面跑着，一面互相說笑着，走進一家照像館底門。一切景像顯得新穎，嫻熟，不關心的意味，除了那夾在風中的，有時揉入人底眼里會使人無端淌出淚來的那黃沙，還有那夾在風中的，時時更密，更緊地飄過來的那</p>
<p>卜卜卜卜……</p>
<p>從那以後，我無論在宿舍里，在食堂里，或走到校園看水池里的金魚的時候，我總是聽到那單調的而又積極的聲音，㢠繞着我底耳里。</p>
<p>開學前的一個禮拜日晚上，那間屋里祇有我和一個十四五歲的同學。當其餘五六個孩子都跑進租界里看影戲去的空兒，我們就都在寫信。院子里很靜。我底心里却時時充滿着不寗，迷矇和疑惑，時時又好像聽到那夾在風里不斷刺耳的槍聲。</p>
<p>我靦覥地問那個孩子，看他“是否也呼到那種奇突的聲音。他於是對我笑了一笑，又皺了一下鼻樑，卑夷着說：</p>
<p>—是日本兵打靶呢！你慢慢會聽慣的。</p>
<p>這一點啟示對於我是一個很有效的帮助，使我從迷矇和疑惑里轉入具體的想像來。</p>
<p>以後每隔三五天，我又可聽到那同樣的槍聲了。有時正在一個平靜的灰色黎明中的睡夢里，聽到那清脆而密接的連續的打擊，就會像想出一些豆綠色的矮小而好動的兵在野外活動着，踏過人家底田苗，越過一些通菜園的水溝，把那屠殺的機械放在田壠上，向着晨曦，向着啼鷄聲里的小村開始扮演了。</p>
<p>卜卜卜卜…卜卜卜卜…</p>
<p>有時，在一個霧的早晨，我又聽到那沉重而窒悶的槍聲，我甚至迷失了那個飄過來它們的那方向。我祇能想像那冷酷的鋁田的死底安琪兒，在朦朦一片霧陣里，它無選擇地穿過去，穿過來。</p>
<p>那雖是聽慣了的聲音却終於使我不能保持寗靜。我底想像生出了針刺，那些針刺很细微地刺痛我底神經，於是一種新來的，擴大了的迷矇和疑惑又佔據了我。</p>
<p>我在一個夕暮時分，向郊外馬塲道那邊踱去，一邊踱着，一邊把握着那飄忽的如黑蝙蝠似的槍聲。我看到一輛輛的汽車打大道盡頭的跑馬塲開過來，駛向都市里去。那些賭罷的，坐在膠皮車里的市民和商贩们把塗了灰土的臉兒扮乍滑稽的或哀苦的丑角相。我走了很遠，一至太陽已慢慢下沉。那槍聲中止了。</p>
<p>隔了不多久，從前面跑來一輛大的汽車，上面載着豆綠色的兵們，向市里的方面冲過來。我看到那車頂上的架起來的屠殺的機械正對準我底胸口，正對準我底眼睛。我猜想那死庇安琪兒底水冷的箭矢，也在對準我底心臟兇笑着吧。</p>
<p>一陣旋風留給我一个寒戰。生存之鞭使我清醒。</p>
<h3>櫻花殘了</h3>
<p>— 魯平</p>
<p>櫻花殘了……</p>
<p>一種恐戄像磨磐那樣的壓在自己的心上，整整地三年以來，我幾乎給它壓得連喘一口氣的自由都失却了。於是心情也變遷得非常利害：從前，我愛春天，也愛秋天，因為春天好像一個美麗的少女，她那明媚活潑的姿熊，十分的引起我的愛戀，秋天恰如㊀位英武的勇士，他那雄偉不屈的精神，很令我無涯的欽敬。但，現在我不但怕見秋天，而且簡直連了春天也不會和我發生好感了。我憎惡這勢利的春光，它旣給了人們以溫柔甜蜜，轉眼又要呌人們受它殘酷的剝削，譬如一個不忠實的女人，起先她是怎樣地讓人去愛她，不久却終於使人去受了她的欺騙，她自己就得意洋洋地去了。秋天的一切是死的，只要秋天一降臨，大自然便死去了一半，到了此時，我自己心頭那恐懼的磨磐也壓得特別重了。人一過中年，就好像一年中的秋天來臨，秋天是中年人將老老年人將死的象徵！雖則，我還剛纔跨進中年人領域的邊緣，然而一看到這象徵就會興起人生如朝露的悲哀來的。</p>
<p>這一次回到故鄉，恰巧是櫻花凋謝的季節，因此沒有看到櫻花，可是，雖沒有看到櫻花，而櫻花給我的回味却永遠也不會忘記的。</p>
<p>我的愛櫻花，母寗說是同情櫻花的生命和我的幸福一般地短促，所以看到了櫻花，立卽會追懷到我的童年時代，可是過去只像是一個夢，這夢已離開得那麼遙遠，想起來也多少有點糢糊了。縱使在櫻花樹底下能看到別些孩子們在儘情謳歌笑樂，還會引起自己一點高興，但這高興在霎那間便會給一層薄薄的感傷罩住的。</p>
<p>如今又是櫻花凋謝的季候了，春光也將悄悄地逝去，而無意中自己恰恰在這個時候會從遙遠的客地跑回了故鄉來。於是在櫻花樹下又重溫了童年的舊夢。我雖沒有看到細緻潔白的櫻花盛放，而當一陣大風吹過時，祗見無千無萬片的殘花瓣兒在空中飄舞，飄在草徑里，飄在我的身上，像秋風里的落葉。不禁太息着“櫻花又殘了！我何以不早些回來呢？”</p>
<p>現在又悄然地離開了故鄉，走上了這生活的征途。</p>

<h3>Tenth Anniversary of the National Government's Establishment of the Capital in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Grand Ceremony Held Yesterday; Chairman Lin Attended and Delivered a Speech; Discussing the Progress of People's Livelihood Construction Over the Past Decade; Improvements in Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The eighteenth marked the tenth anniversary of the National Government's establishment of the capital in Nanjing. The entire city of the capital was adorned with flags in celebration. The National Government held a grand commemorative ceremony at ten o'clock in the morning in the Great Hall. Participants included Ye Chucang, Zhang Ji, Chen Lifu, Deng Jiayan, Li Wenfan, Jing Hengyi, Wang Boqun, Wang Chonghui, He Yingqin, Jiang Zuobin, Zhang Yipeng, Gu Zhenglun, Chen Xunyong, Zhang Daofan, Liu Jiwen, Cao Haosen, Wei Daoming, Wang Gu Pan, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and others, as well as civil officials above the rank of Senior Appointment from various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions, and all staff of the National Government, totaling over a thousand people. After the music was played and Chairman Lin led the attendees in performing the rituals, he delivered an extemporaneous speech. The ceremony concluded with music at ten forty, and everyone went to take a group photo in front of the National Government Hall before dispersing. (Eighteenth, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Lin delivered a speech at the tenth anniversary commemoration of the National Government's establishment of the capital in Nanjing on the morning of the eighteenth, titled "People's Livelihood Construction Over the Past Decade." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Reflecting on the Past Today marks the tenth anniversary of the National Government's establishment of the capital in Nanjing. I believe that the greatest significance of holding this commemorative meeting today lies in reflecting on our work achievements over the past decade. Zeng Zi once said that he examined himself three times a day. I feel that not only should we, as individuals, examine ourselves three times a day, but the government should also frequently reflect on past policies to see if they are all based on the principle of benefiting the country and the people, and whether there are things that should have been done but were not, or things that should not have been done but were. Therefore, in today's commemorative meeting, we should present a report on the work done by the government in the past decade, partly as our own self-examination and self-reflection, and partly as a report to the people of the whole country on the work of the past decade. The work done by the National Government in the past decade has been very extensive. In this short period, we certainly cannot give a very detailed report. The Premier told us in the Outline of National Reconstruction that the primary task of national reconstruction is people's livelihood, and the four basic needs of people's livelihood are food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Today, we will present a brief report on the work done by the government in the past decade regarding the aspects of food, clothing, housing, and transportation for the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Food In terms of food, our country has been based on agriculture since ancient times. In terms of food, the production was originally very rich. The various grains produced domestically were not only sufficient for self-sufficiency, but there was often a surplus. However, in recent decades, due to the advancement of agricultural technology in the world, our country's agriculture has inevitably paled in comparison. In addition, banditry and unrest made the rural areas close to bankruptcy. The government, recognizing this, has made extraordinary efforts in recent years to relieve the rural areas, and has paid special attention to the improvement of agricultural technology. Regarding agricultural improvement, there are the Central Agricultural Experiment Station and the National Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute, etc. Regarding agricultural extension, there are the Central Model Agricultural Extension Area and the Wujiang Agricultural Extension Experiment Area, etc. Regarding the relief of rural economy, there is the Central Model Warehouse, which currently has five specialized warehouses and over 300 branch warehouses. Recently, in order to adjust agricultural products, circulate rural funds, and promote the development of the national rural economy, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has jointly organized the Agricultural Capital Bureau with domestic banks, with a fixed capital of 30 million yuan, which will be allocated by the government in installments, and a matching fund of 30 million yuan, which will be jointly paid by the participating banks. The amount of circulating funds will be agreed upon by the participating banks and the Agricultural Capital Bureau. It has now been established and is actively operating. We anticipate that the results achieved in developing the rural economy in the future will be very significant. The above is the work done by the government in recent years regarding food.</p>
<p>Clothing Secondly, regarding clothing, it can be divided into two parts: the agricultural part and the industrial part. In the agricultural part, the agricultural improvement, agricultural extension, and relief of the rural economy mentioned above are mostly related to the aspect of clothing. In addition, there is the establishment of the Silk Improvement Committee and the improvement of the Zhengding Cotton Experiment Field. Research is being conducted separately on mulberry planting, seed production, silkworm rearing, and cotton planting to strive for improvement. Although the time has been short, considerable results have been achieved. This is the work done by the government regarding the agricultural part of clothing. In the industrial part, such as the establishment of the Cotton Industry Control Committee to concentrate power and thoroughly seek the improvement of the cotton industry, as well as the encouragement of the textile industry, the relief of the silk reeling industry, and the promotion of the woolen fabric industry, the purpose is to increase the massive production in the industrial aspect. This is the work done by the government regarding the industrial part of clothing.</p>
<p>Housing Thirdly, when it comes to housing, there is also an important report. Before our country opened up to trade, we also had very good architecture and magnificent palaces. The bricks, tiles, and wood used were all sourced domestically. However, in recent decades, many of the materials used in construction have been imported, and the original domestic materials have been discarded, resulting in an increasing trade deficit for the country. The government, recognizing this, has made every effort in recent years to promote the use of domestic materials in construction. China originally had very good wood. Now, after the government's promotion, timber merchants have also made this wood into tongue-and-groove boards, which are not only cheaper but also more beautiful than foreign goods. Recently, construction in various places has been adopting this domestic material one after another. This is indeed a significant progress in Chinese architecture. In addition, the manufacture of bricks and tiles has progressed very quickly in China. China also has some production of non-ferrous metals and cement, but unfortunately, the quantity is too small to meet the demand. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is currently operating a steel plant. After large-scale shipments in the future, it will definitely be of great help to the building materials aspect.</p>
<p>Transportation Fourthly, when it comes to transportation, the government has done the most work in this area. It can be divided into four parts. First, the railway part. The railways newly built in the past decade that have been completed and opened to traffic include the Zhushao section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the western section and port section of the Longhai Railway, and the Taizhao branch line, the Sujia Railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Jiangnan Railway, the Huainan Railway, and the main and branch lines of the Tongpu Railway, totaling 2,754 kilometers in length. Those under construction include the Hangcao Railway, the Nanping Railway, the Xuanqu Railway, and the Xiangqian Railway, totaling 1,790 kilometers in length. Other major projects related to the railway include the Capital Ferry completed in September 1933, the Lianyungang Port completed at the end of 1935, and the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, which began construction in November 1934 and is expected to be completed in the summer of this year. Second, the highway part. Before 1927, domestic highway construction was sporadic, crude, and had little to show for it. After the National Government established the capital in Nanjing, the Ministries of Communications and Railways successively formulated a system of national trunk and branch lines, as well as engineering standards. Highway construction officially began to proceed. After the establishment of the National Economic Council Preparatory Office in November 1931, it first began to supervise the construction of inter-provincial highways, expanding from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Henan. In 1933, the Council was formally established, and it comprehensively planned the inter-provincial highways, allocated funds, and continued construction. The important routes in the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Fujian, and Qinghai, as well as the borders of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian, were also successively included in the scope of supervision. The Xilan, Xihan, and Hanning roads have been successively built. Recently, the Jingdian Highway has also been directly opened to traffic. In total, 100,9749 kilometers of highways have been completed nationwide, 16,165 kilometers are under construction, and 45,979 kilometers have been surveyed and are about to begin construction. A total of 171,893 kilometers of highways will soon be fully open to traffic. It cannot but be said that this is a significant progress in China's transportation. Third, the shipping administration aspect. Our country's shipping industry was originally very immature. After active reorganization in recent years, it has made daily progress. For example, the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the improvement of shipping management, the improvement of shipping methods, the increase of sailing speed, and the promotion of shipping cooperation have all achieved considerable results. If the competent authorities can continue to pay attention and make efforts in the future, it will not be difficult for our country's shipping industry to compete with foreign shipping companies. Fourth, in terms of civil aviation, since the successive establishment of the China National Aviation Corporation and the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, as of the end of 1936, China's aviation routes have increased to 14 routes, with a total length of 17,800 kilometers. The two companies commonly use 24 aircraft. The number of passengers was only 2,654 in 1930, but it has increased to 10,404 in 1935. The distance flown by passengers was only 1,027,902 kilometers in 1930, but it has increased to 5,857,103 kilometers in 1935. Based on this extrapolation, in a few years, China's aviation routes should be able to cover the entire country. The above is the work done by the government in the past decade regarding transportation.</p>
<p>Striving for the Future The above report is only in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. In addition, the development of mineral resources, the promotion of forestry and land reclamation, the construction of water conservancy, the improvement of postal and telecommunications, and the widespread establishment of long-distance telephones in major cities across the country are all related to people's livelihood construction and are also the basic work for building a new China. Therefore, some people believe that China has made great progress in these ten years. However, when we think about it ourselves, we feel that it is still far from the degree we hope for. The Premier said in the Plans for National Reconstruction that the whole country should build 100,000 miles of railways and 1,000,000 miles of stone roads. Now we have only built more than 10,000 miles of railways and more than 100,000 miles of highways, which is only one-tenth or two-tenths of what the Premier said. There are many other things that have not reached one-tenth or two-tenths. How should we encourage ourselves and strive to complete the work we want to do and the responsibilities we should fulfill in the future? I think we all have the same feeling when we participate in this commemorative meeting today. In the future, we can only work together with the people of the whole country to complete our mission of building a new China. (Eighteenth, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Kawagoe Plans to Suggest to the Japanese Government a Diplomatic Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>Adjustment of the Economic Activity Front is Necessary; The Newspaper Publishing Rights Case Should Be Negotiated with a Sympathetic Attitude; Japanese Newspapers Publish Reckless Provocative News</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Asahi Shimbun reported this morning a special dispatch from Nanjing stating that the Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigeru Kawagoe, is preparing to submit six points of suggestions regarding the diplomatic policy towards China to the Japanese government after returning to Japan. They are: 1) State that as a result of the clarification of the Southwest issue and the resolution of the Xi'an Incident, the Chinese National Government is now taking advantage of this favorable development and moving towards national unification. 2) In terms of its policy towards Japan, the National Government sincerely hopes for a resolution of the North China political issue. Although the resolution of such local issues is difficult to ensure the complete opening of the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations, given the current environment, even if Japan insists on a "realistic approach," it is necessary to seek its resolution within a considerable range. 3) The degree of Sino-British economic cooperation is progressing extremely rapidly, which can be regarded as an expression of the US policy towards the Far East, especially towards China, and should be given special attention. 4) Japan should not be indifferent to the National Government's five-year economic construction plan. 5) It is necessary to adjust and strengthen the front line of Japanese economic activities in China. The institutions established by various provinces in China should be integrated and an "economic embassy" should be organized as a control mechanism. 6) Regarding China's demand to abolish the extraterritoriality of various countries, Japan should negotiate with a sympathetic attitude. (Eighteenth, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The cancellation of the resignation intention of our Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, and the scheduled return to Japan for debriefing by Ambassador Kawagoe, both indicate that the atmosphere of Sino-Japanese diplomacy has entered a new stage, gradually changing from mutual observation to crystallization. Japanese newspapers have recently published extreme provocative news about our country. The Yomiuri Shimbun is particularly noteworthy. The newspaper published a news item on the 15th of this month, detailing how our country is preparing for war against Japan and publishing a map showing our country's three major defense lines and bases for land and air forces, pointing out that our country intends to declare war on Japan. The newspaper again published a report the next day on the extensive schemes of our government to manipulate the independence and anti-Japanese movements of the Manchurian, Mongolian, and Korean people. Today, the newspaper published another news item, which is very long, describing how our country's attitude towards Japan is overly tough. This kind of news has been published in the first item on the front page in the largest font for days in a row. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun also published a news item in the same position in large headlines today, detailing how our government is taking advantage of Kong Xiangxi's visit to England to attend the coronation of the British king and Zhang Qun's overseas inspection to provoke European and American countries and hinder Japan, causing Japan to fall into a seriously unfavorable position. The sources of the above news are all marked as coming from special correspondents in Shanghai. Furthermore, the "Evening Empire" even published lengthy extra editions on the 15th and 16th, the content of which was entirely about how China is taking advantage of Foreign Minister Sato's diplomatic policy to despise Japan. The newspaper, on the one hand, advocates a punitive policy towards China, and on the other hand, overthrows Sato's diplomatic policy. This kind of news is as abundant as a tide, which makes one suspect whether someone has recently intentionally instigated this systematic anti-China provocative movement, so as to at least resist the opinion advocating a re-examination of Japan's view of China. (Seventeenth, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Nichi Nichi Shimbun continued to publish a news item in the most prominent position today, saying that our country will urge Britain, the United States, and other countries to organize a Pacific collective security guarantee system, entitled "Absolutely Cannot Tolerate Opposition to Our Continental Policy." According to the newspaper's opinion, the establishment of this system will eventually threaten the exercise of Japan's right to national survival. Therefore, Japan should be determined to reject it from beginning to end. The above news gives people the feeling of being reckless or an international provocation.

<h3>Central Government Plans to Temporarily Allow Half of the Duty-Free Import of Foreign Rice to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce to Hold Executive Committee Meeting Today to Discuss; Guangdong Rice Industry Association Sends Telegram to the Whole Country and Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce accepted the requests of various merchants and decided to hold an executive committee meeting on the nineteenth to discuss the method of convening a meeting of representatives of all members of the city. The General Assembly will elect representatives to petition Cheng Tiangu and Yu Wu to allow the duty-free import of foreign rice in accordance with the number previously determined by the Central Government. The Guangdong Rice Industry Association telegraphed the whole country and overseas Chinese on the eighteenth, saying that Guangdong rice can only buy six, seven, or eight catties per yuan, which is unprecedented since the Republic of China. The central government has a temporary decree to allow the duty-free import of foreign rice, with a fixed amount, to help the people who are suffering from famine. Although it is not a fundamental and thorough plan, it is still a necessary measure at present. However, some rice merchants in Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Shanghai, and Zhejiang used the Guangdong famine in advance to raise the price of rice to profit, and then delayed transportation on the pretext of using their insidious schemes, regarding the Guangdong famine as a private source of profit. The so-called promotion of domestic rice and maintenance of the countryside are nothing more than using public office for private gain, wanting to put the people of Guangdong on the stove to be cooked and chewed, and enjoying themselves privately. It is hoped that they will speak out righteously and uphold justice, so that the traitors can restrain themselves. It is heard that the central government plans to temporarily approve half of the duty-free import of foreign rice to Guangdong, which is 2 million dan. (Eighteenth, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>American Woman Naturalized as Chinese</h3>

Since they have come to China, they should respect Chinese law. This naturalization is due to her admiration and belief in Chinese morality and culture.

<h3>Soviet Shipbuilding and US Military Exercises</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Since Japan announced the abolition of the Washington Treaty until it officially came into effect at the end of last year, the situation in the Pacific has fallen into a state of no treaty. Judging from the current situation, the conclusion of a new treaty seems to be a distant prospect. As a result, large-scale naval competition has gradually begun. In the past two or three months, the British Navy has continuously held exercises in the South Pacific and has decided to increase the defensive works of Singapore and Hong Kong with huge funds. Now the Soviet Union also has a plan to accelerate the construction of warships, and the US Air Force is conducting an unprecedented large-scale military exercise near the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>We must know that all these naval competitive activities are developing with the aggressive ambitions of certain parties. Japan is adopting a policy of advancing both north and south in the Pacific. The Japanese warlords have already placed the entire financial and economic structure on the basis of a "quasi-wartime system." This naturally aroused the emergency alert of various countries in the Pacific. Therefore, the increase in these military activities, on the one hand, shows the approaching crisis of World War, and on the other hand, shows that various countries are preparing their strength to resist the threat from Japan.</p>
<p>This Soviet shipbuilding has a significant meaning in the situation in the Pacific. The Soviet Navy was originally weak. However, in recent years, due to the intensified threats from Japan and Germany, the Soviet Union began to pay attention to naval power after completing the defensive works of the eastern and western borders. The British-Soviet naval agreement was concluded last autumn. Britain recognized the Soviet Union's right to expand its navy in the Far East at its discretion. This was the precursor to the Soviet shipbuilding. From then on, the Soviet Union rushed to build submarines and completed the first step of coastal defense. It also actively opened the Arctic route so that the Baltic and White Sea fleets could be quickly transferred to the Far East. According to London’s "Daily Telegraph", the Soviet Union's submarine power now has ninety submarines in the Baltic Sea and forty in Vladivostok, ranking first in the world. After this step was successful, it further planned to build giant warships.</p>
<p>The US Air Force has often conducted military exercises in the Hawaiian Islands in recent years. But this time, 139 warships participated in the exercises, and the exercise area reached 2 million square miles. It can be said to be the largest-scale exercise in American history. The demonstration effect of such a large-scale exercise is very obvious. I remember that in the large-scale exercise of the US Navy two years ago, a secret document was stolen by a spy. Therefore, the exercise was suddenly stopped. Last year, the United States uncovered a naval espionage case, which involved many Japanese people. Therefore, in this US Air Force exercise, the formation of the fleet was kept completely secret. From this point, we can also see the sharp opposition between the US Navy and Japan in the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is rumored that this Soviet shipbuilding has contacted the United States and France, hoping to obtain their assistance in engineering, but the United States and France have refused due to various reasons. We feel that the spread of this news also obviously has the meaning of showing off to Japan and making it concede in naval competition. There is no military conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. There is only a convergence of interests. There is no need to say anything about the relationship between France and the Soviet Union. Recently, Davis, the special envoy sent by the United States to London, also met with Soviet Ambassador to the United States Gorsky to discuss naval issues. This indicates that naval cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union is still quite possible. If this step can be realized, it will be a great pressure on Japan's aggressive ambitions and will be very beneficial to the entire situation in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Oslo Convention Countries Draft New Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>A Prelude to Improving International Trade: Beque Invited to Visit the US in June to Promote a World Economic Conference</p>
<p>⊙Beijing After a six-day meeting, the expert conference attended by economic authorities from the Oslo Convention countries, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, closed yesterday. The draft of the new agreement will be signed by various countries, and its purpose is to increase the trade volume of the so-called "Oslo" countries. According to the official gazette issued by the expert conference, this is the first step to eliminate international trade barriers. Experts from various countries will send the draft agreement to their respective governments, and the governments will send ministers to attend official meetings to decide on the implementation policy. The official meeting is scheduled to be held in The Hague at the end of May. (National Maritime Telegraph on the 18th)</p>
<p>⊙Beijing Before the Prime Minister of Belgium, Zeiland, is about to leave for the United States, experts from Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Belgium, the signatory countries of the Oslo Convention, have suddenly drafted a multilateral agreement to improve international trade. This practical achievement is the result of months of consideration, and all those who promote new international economic organizations welcome it. It is also found that Zeiland's visit to the United States is related to the recent visit of Dr. Schacht, President of the German National Bank, to Belgium, and the subsequent visits of US special envoy Davis and British Foreign Secretary Eden to Belgium. Eden's visit to Belgium will be around the weekend of next week. The currently drafted agreement has been attached with implementation procedures and submitted to the governments of their respective countries for approval. The Belgian Prime Minister's visit to the United States, although nominally to accept an honorary degree from Princeton University, is actually to discuss with the US President ways to revitalize world trade. If this is successful, a world economic conference will be convened. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 18th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Washington officials are speculating today about the Belgian Prime Minister Zeiland's visit to the United States in mid-June to meet with President Roosevelt. Because Zeiland is informally entrusted by Britain and France to inquire about the hope of holding a world economic and peace conference with the United States. Informed sources believe that the second move of the United States may be closely related to the Spanish Civil War, because the current war has fallen into a stalemate. Both sides may ask President Roosevelt to mediate and establish a lasting truce. At the same time, officials here also believe that European countries are deeply aware that the President has no intention of proposing an economic and disarmament conference at this time. Secretary of State Hull feels that if the United States initiates it at this time, it will not be successful. (National Telegraph on the 17th)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels Regarding the Belgian Prime Minister Zeiland's visit to the United States to meet with President Roosevelt, it was recently learned that President Roosevelt invited Prime Minister Zeiland to visit the United States on the 11th of this month, before the by-election of the Belgian House of Representatives. At the same time, the governments of Britain and France also entrusted Prime Minister Zeiland to investigate the possibility of removing various obstacles to international trade, as stated in the monetary agreement between Britain, France and the United States. It is known that President Roosevelt's invitation is naturally complementary to the actions of Britain and France. He will do his best to make the mission of Prime Minister Zeiland come to fruition as soon as possible. In addition, the devaluation of the Belgian currency last year promoted the restoration of the economy and finance, and part of the reason was that it was successful by referring to President Roosevelt's experience. The ultimate goal of the investigation work currently being carried out by Prime Minister Zeiland is to convene an international economic conference. Once the Prime Minister arrives in the United States, the investigation work will have been completed. He will know clearly what European countries can contribute to the international trade recovery and can talk to President Roosevelt as "Europe's envoy" so that the international economic conference can be convened quickly.

<h3>Disarmament Bureau Extends Meeting</h3>
<p>[Paris] The Parisian newspaper "Le Petit Parisien" recently reported that the Disarmament Conference Bureau, which was originally scheduled to hold a meeting on May 6, will be postponed because the League of Nations will hold a temporary congress at the end of May to discuss the issue of Egypt joining the League of Nations. At that time, representatives from various countries can take the opportunity to discuss the disarmament issue first, so the Disarmament Conference Bureau meeting may be postponed until then.

<h3>Coronation of King George VI Approaching</h3>
<p>London Rehearses Ceremonial Parade</p>
<p>[London] The coronation ceremony of King George VI is less than a month away. London rehearsed a ceremonial parade this morning. At dawn, the streets were deserted, and the parade followed the scheduled route. The parade started from Westminster Abbey with a total of sixteen carriages. The first was the royal carriage in which the King and Queen rode together, followed by the carriages of the Prime Minister and the Prime Ministers of the various autonomous territories, then the carriages of the royal nobles, and finally the carriage of the Queen Mother Mary. A music band led the way in front of the carriages, and a team of mounted police escorted the parade on both sides. Staff members held clocks to measure the time and recorded some details in a book for reference. There were also two small trucks full of police officers, equipped with wireless communication devices for broadcasting. When the parade started, because it was still early, there were few pedestrians on the street watching. Later, more and more people gathered. In addition, to make the rehearsal as realistic as possible, the organizers built grandstands in two areas. When the parade arrived there, the grandstands were already crowded. Except for the King and Queen and other major personnel who did not participate, everything else was the same as the formal ceremony. There were even vendors along the street selling "Coronation Ceremony Rehearsal Order Forms," and citizens scrambled to buy them. City threefold.

<h3>French Foreign Minister Elucidates Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Restoring the Authority of the League of Nations, Peaceful Cooperation with All Countries</p>
<p>⊙Garges, Southern France. Foreign Minister Delbos recently delivered an important speech at a banquet for the Radical Socialist Youth Party members here, explaining that the goal of French foreign policy is to safeguard peace. The main principles followed are as follows: ㊀ Mutual assistance pacts should be signed by the member states of the League of Nations by region to restore the authority of the League of Nations. ㊁ The policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War should be strictly enforced and monitored. Volunteer soldiers from all countries should withdraw from Spain, and the civil war should be mediated in the hope of restoring its independence. ㊂ The three major democratic countries of Britain, France, and the United States must cooperate with each other to safeguard peace. Any situation in which ideological groups form opposing sides must be avoided at all costs. ㊃ The existing friendly relations between France and its allies, especially the Soviet Union, Poland, and the Little Entente countries, should be maintained and promoted. In addition, France should establish new friendly relations with other countries, but only on the condition that these new relations do not conflict with existing agreements. ㊄ France should take the lead in advocating for universal disarmament and propose to the presidency of the Disarmament Conference the implementation of a monitoring system for the armaments of each country and the public announcement by each country of its armaments situation. ㊅ Revitalize international trade and promote peaceful cooperation among nations so that the economic self-sufficiency policies pursued by certain countries can be gradually abolished. Regarding this, Belgian Prime Minister Janson is currently making efforts (referring to conducting an investigation into the possibility of removing international trade barriers).

<h3>British Prime Minister Baldwin Speaks of Peace</h3>
<p>With Pioneer Qualifications, Britain Undoubtedly Holds the Key</p>
<p>[London] British Prime Minister Baldwin delivered a broadcast address on the responsibility of the British Empire on the evening of the 16th, saying that although the world is encountering various national difficulties and dangers, he firmly believes that it will eventually reach a state of peace and prosperity. However, there are still many thorns ahead, which cannot be achieved overnight, so there must be a joint effort, perseverance, and above all, a pioneer. Among all countries in the world, the British Empire is best qualified to lead the way. This is not because the British are superior to other nations, but because they have experience and have learned the lesson of cooperation in solving current problems. In practice, we have shown that the solution to difficulties depends on discussion, not force. Only patience can create trust, and only trust can create harmony. The construction of the British Empire is based on the idea that internal war is impossible. If this concept were extended to all countries in the world, would it not be even more beneficial? The British people have always held the ideal of freedom, and today they should aim to maintain this ideal and prove its appropriateness. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Political Warfare</h3>
<p>Entering its Fourth Week</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The third week of political warfare ended yesterday, the 17th, and we have now entered the final decisive stage. The nationwide candidate lineup has also been largely completed. At the same time, the battle lines have been reinforced, and all efforts have been concentrated on the battle of words. The final charge has not yet been reached because the government has no party affiliation and is therefore inevitably low-key. Yesterday (17th), one additional candidate was added from the Minseito and neutral sides. At this point, it can be said that the fourth week of the battle of words has been entered. With the exception of two districts in Oita and Ehime prefectures, all districts have exceeded the quota. The 19th is the last day to stop the election bulletin, and the official struggle for power will then unfold. (Domei News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>Former Minister of Education Enters the Battle - Need Funds, Come to Me</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] More than ten days have passed since the dissolution of the Diet. More than 840 candidates, aiming to win the clean votes of the people, are fighting for the central plains with a do-or-die spirit. The greatest difficulty for these candidates is obtaining election funds. Former Minister of Education Hirao Hachisaburo suddenly entered the vortex of political warfare and issued a declaration: "Anyone who needs funds, come to me. If you are truly a candidate who can purify the political world, regardless of your party affiliation, I will provide you with funds." In this era of election fund panic, Mr. Hirao's declaration has become a major topic in the political world. There are already thirty candidates who have passed Mr. Hirao's "examination." It is said that Mr. Hirao's move has nothing to do with the new party. (Domei News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>Government Adopts a Wait-and-See Attitude, Hoping for Factionalization of Existing Parties</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] With only ten days remaining until the general election, the anti-government fervor of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties is becoming increasingly intense. In this state, it is inevitable that they will submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet in the special Diet session. However, the government is relatively optimistic and continues to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, believing that the strong attitude of existing parties this time has a strong election policy connotation. However, regarding the establishment of a new party, according to the current situation, it is almost impossible to expect the emergence of the new party initially planned by Prime Minister Hayashi. Therefore, the government has no intention of coming out to carry out new party work before the general election. They can only hope for a new turn of events in the political world after the general election. After all, even if the Seiyukai and Minseito parties occupy a majority of 370-380 seats as a result of this election, their divisions are expected to undergo considerable qualitative changes. At the same time, the internal affairs of the political parties themselves are quite complex. Even if some people advocate submitting a no-confidence motion after the special Diet session opens, considerable disputes will inevitably arise before they can achieve a united front, or even trigger a crisis of division within the existing parties. This is the point of greatest concern for the government. If the unity of the political parties is unexpectedly strong and they take a stand against the government, the government has secretly resolved to dissolve the Diet again. Therefore, the extent to which the confrontation between the political parties and the government intensifies after the election is the deciding factor in the future direction of the political situation.

<h3>Japan-Chile Trade Conference</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The first trade deliberation meeting between the Chilean commercial delegation and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the business community was held in Tokyo on the 17th. The Chilean delegation asked questions about the Japanese proposal to renew trade relations, and the Japanese side responded. The intentions and proposals of the Chilean side can be presented at the second deliberation meeting on the 20th. All parties concerned are highly anticipating the effect of this meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, the Japanese proposal was generally based on the adjustment of Japan-Chile trade in order to increase mutual benefits, and it was hoped that Chile would ease the current exchange control measures. The Japanese side also believed that if it was necessary to adjust trade, it would implement compensatory imports for Chilean products. For products such as Chilean nitrate and copper, a public association would be established in the private sector to increase their imports. On the other hand, the export of Japanese low-priced heavy industrial products should also be increased. A consortium would be formed based on the model of the Japan-Brazil Enterprise Council in order to promote trade between the two groups. In addition, it is also desired to take this opportunity to realize a Japan-Chile trade reciprocity agreement and establish settlement compensation methods, etc., and to use this as a prerequisite for the establishment of a Japan-Chile Economic Association.

<h3>A Record of Our Country's Special Envoy Delegation to the Coronation of the English King, Westward Bound</h3>
<p>—Via Hong Kong to the Philippines—</p>
<p>Singapore News: Special Envoy Kong, Deputy Envoy Chen, and their party of twenty-seven people, were ordered to represent the Chinese government to celebrate the coronation of the English King. This reporter also had the opportunity to accompany them and will now write a summary of the sights and sounds along the way to inform the people of the country.</p>
<p>The ship the delegation took was the Italian vessel Victoria. It was originally scheduled to depart at 12:00 noon on April 2nd, but because so many people came to the ship to bid farewell to Special Envoy Kong, it was delayed until 2:00 PM before it set sail. The Victoria was very well-equipped, and the weather was calm along the way, so everyone felt very comfortable. The next afternoon, Special Envoy Kong gathered the people traveling with him on the ship for a meeting, assigned tasks, and instructed everyone on the points to pay attention to during this trip. Many of the people traveling together had not met before, but on the ship, there were many opportunities for conversation and laughter, and in less than two days, everyone became good friends.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the 4th, the ship arrived in Hong Kong. The Governor of Hong Kong, who was resting in the countryside, specially sent the Colonial Secretary, Smith, to greet them. In addition, local gentlemen and representatives from the military and political circles of Guangzhou, numbering no less than several hundred, welcomed them at the pier. Special Envoy Kong and others were first accompanied by Smith on the Governor's launch directly to Government House for a brief rest, and then proceeded to Sir Robert Ho Tung's banquet. During the banquet, Sir Robert Ho Tung raised his glass to celebrate the longevity of the Republic of China, and Special Envoy Kong also raised his glass to celebrate the longevity of the English King in return. Sir Robert Ho Tung praised Special Envoy Kong's past achievements in politics and wished that this trip would further consolidate Sino-British relations. Special Envoy Kong replied briefly, saying that this trip was solely to celebrate the coronation of the English King, but after the ceremony, he hoped to travel to various countries to visit various economic construction projects as a reference for the construction of a new China. He also said that Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland were connected, and since the opening of the Canton-Hankow Railway, the relationship has become even closer. In the future, Hong Kong should be an important figure in promoting Sino-British friendship. Because Deputy Envoy Chen also had a banquet with the British Naval Commander of the Far East, Liddell, he excused himself shortly after sitting down at Sir Robert Ho Tung's house. In the afternoon, there were two more tea parties, one organized by more than forty overseas Chinese groups to bid farewell to Special Envoy Kong's trip to England, held at the Hotel des Nations at 4:00 PM, and the other a farewell party by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, held at 5:00 PM. Special Envoy Kong gave speeches at both times, mainly saying that the achievements of the National Government's revolution in the past decade or so owed much to the contribution of Guangdong compatriots at home and abroad. In the future, there would be many national construction projects, and he hoped that Guangdong compatriots would continue to work hard for the country with the same spirit as before. Special Envoy Kong especially made three earnest requests to the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, saying that China was increasingly industrialized, and the outlet for industrial manufactured goods depended on merchants. Merchants opened up sales channels, and then industry had a way to succeed. If industry succeeded, the living standards of farmers could also be raised. In the past, the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce had already achieved results in promoting domestic goods, and it should continue to do its best in the future. Special Envoy Kong was extremely sincere when he spoke, and the listeners were moved and responded with warm applause. On the 4th, all the Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong published the news of the special envoy in large characters and had editorials to bid farewell to the special envoy to England. The Victoria also left Hong Kong at around 8:00 PM that afternoon.</p>
<p>After leaving Hong Kong, the weather became hotter day by day. Everyone packed away their spring clothes and put on their summer clothes. Some people, because there were still stoves at home when they left Shanghai and Nanjing, did not expect it to get over ninety degrees on the way, so they did not bring summer clothes. At this point, they all complained. Fortunately, there was still a slight sea breeze blowing on the deck, and when it was too hot, they could also take a bath and swim, so the days could still be spent comfortably.</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM on the 6th, our ship arrived in Manila. Representatives of the government, the party headquarters, and Chinese merchants crowded the ship's reception room to welcome Special Envoy Kong. Our Mr. Kong had prepared cars to take us on a tour of the city for a week. The scenery of the South Seas was different from that of temperate regions. Red and purple were everywhere. The person leading our tour said, "This is heaven on earth."</p>
<p>After a brief tour, we went to attend the tea party of the Kuomintang's general branch. Special Envoy Kong knew that the overseas Chinese in the Philippines would definitely want to know the latest news of various constructions in the country, so he took this opportunity to briefly explain the construction of highways, railways, aviation, and other aspects in the past few years. At the same time, he particularly pointed out that under the leadership of President Chiang, China's construction in the past few years had been progressing simultaneously in both material and spiritual aspects. The spiritual aspect of construction was the New Life Movement. Finally, he said that overseas Chinese in the Philippines, in addition to developing their careers locally, should never forget their motherland. China had had import problems for many years, but it did not damage the country's vitality. The most important reason was that it benefited from remittances from overseas Chinese. From this point alone, it can be seen the contribution of overseas Chinese to the motherland. China is now advancing on the road of construction, and overseas Chinese can serve the motherland in both manpower and financial resources. After the tea party, he went to the champagne party held by the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines and the Philippine President at the Presidential Palace. At 12:00 PM, he attended the banquet held by the Chinese Consulate General in the Philippines and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce at the Manila Hotel. During the banquet, Special Envoy Kong said that Sino-Philippine friendship had always been harmonious, and the Chinese government expressed great sympathy for Philippine independence. China is a peace-loving country, and a strong China would not be an obstacle to the Philippines, but an aid to the Philippines. In the future, the two countries should cooperate with each other in commerce and culture to seek peace in the Far East. Many representatives from local political, academic, and business circles attended this banquet and unanimously expressed their admiration for Special Envoy Kong's speech.</p>
<p>The time spent in Manila was not long. In addition to formal banquets, there were many private engagements. There were three people with the surname Chen traveling with us this time. In addition to Deputy Envoy Chen, there were also Mr. Chen Bingzhang and Mr. Chen Liting. The Chen Clan Ancestral Hall in Manila invited all three of them to take photos, write inscriptions, and have tea. Mr. Gui Rongshan, chairman of the National Goods Importers Association in Manila, found the military attache Gui Yongqing in our group and was overjoyed, because there are very few people with the surname Gui. The two of them were from the same clan, and it was rare to meet again overseas, so they were treated with special hospitality. From this point alone, it can be seen that although the two compatriots are far away from their motherland, they are still reluctant to part with the customs and traditions of their motherland.</p>

<h3>Promotion of Cotton Bean Production in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Acres of Land Have Been Closed Off as Areas for Planting Cotton Beans</p>
<p>Wuhu News: The land in northern Anhui is vast, and the production of miscellaneous grains is extremely abundant. However, in recent years, due to the economic depression in rural areas, the farmers in those areas have been unable to seek revitalization. After careful investigation by the construction authorities, it was believed that the soil in northern Anhui could still be widely planted with cotton beans. Now, Hefei, Shouxian, and other counties have been selected, and tens of thousands of acres of land have been closed off as areas for planting improved cotton beans. Technicians such as Jiang Zemin have been dispatched with a large amount of seeds to distribute to farmers for planting around the Grain Rain season, and to provide overall management to seek development. The Construction Department has established a cotton bean promotion management office. Matters such as the design, promotion, production, and cooperative marketing of cotton bean improvement throughout the province, as well as the technical guidance for cotton harvesting, ginning, and packaging, are all the responsibility of the management office. Counties with more than 50,000 acres of cotton bean promotion areas will establish one office, and those with more than 10,000 acres will establish one branch office. All tasks have been fully implemented. If significant results are achieved after the autumn of this year, the promotion will be expanded in the future.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Police Team Conducts Air Defense Drill</h3>
<p>On the 17th, the county police chief and more than 80 members of the police training team conducted a temporary air defense drill. In the morning, leaflets were distributed throughout the city to inform all sectors of the population. In the afternoon, a signal was issued using the time bell of the Jinsha Pagoda to implement traffic control. From 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM, lighting control was also implemented to search for poison gas, rescue the wounded and dead. The air defense gun team fired into the air, creating a very tense atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Shen Junru and Others to Be Publicly Tried</h3>
<p>Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Li Gongpu, Zou Taofen, Wang Zaoshi, Sha Qianli, Shi Liang, and seven others were arrested in Shanghai on November 23 last year. Shi Liang was released on bail to return to her hometown for medical treatment. Shen and the other six were transferred to the Jiangsu Higher Court in Suzhou and sent to the Higher Court Detention Branch Office in Hengjie, Wuxian County, for detention and investigation. Later, Shi Liang recovered from her illness and voluntarily surrendered in Suzhou. After being detained in the women's prison of the Simaqian Street detention center by the High Procuratorate, the prosecutor Weng Zannian completed the investigation. The defendants were charged with forming an organization for the purpose of jointly endangering the Republic of China and propagating doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. In accordance with Article 11 and Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 6 of the Emergency Crime Punishment Law for Jointly Endangering the Republic of China, except for Tao Xingzhi, Zhang Zhongmian, Chen Daohong, Chen Zhuo, and others whose whereabouts are unknown and have been wanted, the defendants Shen Junru, Wang Zaoshi, Li Gongpu, Sha Qianli, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, Shi Liang, Luo Qing (in custody), Gu Liuxin, and Ren Songgao (on bail) were publicly prosecuted to the Criminal Court of the same court on the 3rd of this month. The presiding judge of the Criminal Court 1 of the Higher Court, Wen (Jiongfu), was assigned to hear the case. The case has been fully sorted out and is scheduled to be publicly tried on the 28th and 29th of this month. At that time, in addition to the presiding judge Fang Wenshen, and the chief clerk of the Wu Daquan subject, the two judges Si Wen and Zhu Jianxun will also attend the court to serve on the jury. Furthermore, Li Liejun (Xiehe), a member of the Central Committee who had been convalescing in the Soviet Union, went to the Higher Court Detention Branch Office and the Detention Center on the afternoon of the 17th to visit Shen Junru and Shi Liang, among others.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Sericulture Farmers in Four Rural Areas Collect Ant Eggs</h3>
<p>The spring silkworm season is approaching in an instant. The enthusiasm of farmers in the four rural areas of this county for silkworm farming is stronger than in previous years. The number of silkworm eggs ordered has increased sharply. As of the 18th, more than 145,300 sheets have been ordered. However, the silkworm model area has only received more than 142,000 sheets from the Improvement Association, which is not enough to distribute. The Tangshan Improvement Association purchased 100,000 sheets of Japanese silkworm eggs from Japan to provide assistance. The Japanese silkworm eggs have already been transported to the county and are approved to allocate 20,000 sheets to avoid a shortage of silkworm eggs. Currently, the various guidance stations are scheduled to distribute them on the 19th, 20th, and 21st for three days. However, because the weather this year is colder, the large spring silkworm must be collected by the end of this month. It is reported that a small number of sericulture households in the northern countryside are still using ten types of silkworm eggs, and their hatching period is earlier. They collected silkworm eggs yesterday, and the silkworm bodies are quite good.</p>
<p>Tourists Reach 60,000 People</p>
<p>This county is located on the shores of the lake, with beautiful mountains and clear waters. Party and state dignitaries, as well as people from various ports, come to Wuxi in groups to visit, with several thousand people every day. According to a survey by the county's railway station, an average of 3,000 more tickets must be collected on Saturdays and Sundays each week. At least 6,000 or more tourists arrive in Wuxi every week. If the weekly holidays and spring break during the spring season are combined, there are a total of more than 20 days of vacation, then there will be more than 60,000 tourists. Each tourist spends an average of four yuan in Wuxi, then there is a cash amount of more than 20 million yuan circulating in the county's market during the spring season. Travel agencies and groups came to Wuxi yesterday and the day before yesterday, and all the hotels were full, and the catering industry was booming.</p>
<p>Investigation of Police Chief's Case</p>
<p>Li Junjian, chief of the fifth police station in Dangkou Town, District 8, was recently charged by five citizens of the town, Hua Bingyi, Chen Guojun, Cai Tianmei, Wu Xingnong, and Jin Zhifan, with illegal extortion, bribery of opium offenders, and letting go of the ringleader of thieves. They filed a complaint with the Supervisory Envoy Office, requesting an investigation. After receiving the complaint, Supervisor Ding Han believed that the truth of the allegations should be thoroughly investigated and sent an official letter to County Chief Ji, who then instructed Police Chief Zhang Da to investigate and verify the facts.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Robbery on the Wu-Li Road</h3>
<p>Xiang Wei'an, a resident of Dongdai Town, District 2 of Wuyi, transported more than 50 piculs of rice to Wuxi for sale on the 14th of this month and obtained more than 200 yuan in rice money. On the afternoon of the 16th, he took the money back to Changzhou by car. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 PM, while traveling on the Wu-Li Road near the West Lane of Cuojiatang in Chendu Township, three robbers wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants suddenly appeared. Two of them, holding pistols, ordered Xiang Wei'an to stop. They immediately stepped forward to search him and took all the more than 200 yuan of rice money hidden on his body. They also ordered Zou Wei'an to follow them to a remote place under the desolate kiln at the top of Tangmen. The bandits then left in a north direction. Xiang Wei'an reported the incident to the township chief afterward and requested the county to investigate and arrest the bandits.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Increase in the Proportion of Business Tax</h3>
<p>The provincial revenue of Jiangsu Province is mainly from land tax and business tax. Regarding business tax, the initial collection was not effective due to the wait-and-see attitude of the business community, and the results were poor. Later, after several reorganizations, the amount collected gradually improved. However, the contractor system allowed many contractors to embezzle the funds. Since the Finance Department took over the collection itself from two years ago, it has been put on the right track. Last winter, the tax rate was amended, and the amount collected increased even more. The recently announced provincial budget lists the business tax revenue as 5,109,600 yuan, accounting for one-sixth of the total revenue, an increase of more than one million yuan compared to last year. For this increase, the Finance Department decided to increase the business tax. A meeting of business tax directors from all over the province was specially convened the day before yesterday to discuss this in detail. Preliminary agreements have been reached on both the tax rate and the proportion. Once the reorganization is completed, it can be submitted to the provincial government meeting for discussion and announcement. After this news spread, the business community gathered to discuss it. It is reported that the Provincial Federation of Commerce will convene a temporary members' meeting to discuss this matter.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Vehicle Inspection Uproar Subsides</h3>
<p>Yao Daru, an inspector of the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Administration, inspected automobiles in Tongzhou. More than 200 vehicles were inspected, and 46 were found to be unqualified, resulting in the revocation of licenses and causing an uproar. Director Shen Qi of the Administration specially came to Tongzhou from Zhenjiang. After discussing with representatives of the Party and government agencies, it was decided that all unqualified vehicles would be repaired and then re-inspected by personnel dispatched on May 5. The problem was immediately resolved. Shen talked about Jiangsu Province's rectification of automobiles in various counties, prohibiting the sale of eliminated vehicles from Shanghai to the inland areas.</p>
<p>Lawyers Association Re-Elected</p>
<p>The Nantong County Lawyers Association held a general meeting of members at 1:00 PM on the 17th. As a result of the re-election, Liu Guoquan was elected as the president, and Zhu Rongchang was elected as the vice president.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Major Fire in Caishi Lane</h3>
<p>A major fire broke out in Caishi Lane, Lingqiao Road, at about 11:00 PM on the 16th. When the residents noticed it, it was already beyond control. Because the lane was very narrow, rescue was difficult, and the fire spread more violently. It took an hour to extinguish. The houses burned down include the Shixia Rong Shui Mu workshop, Chun Ji Oil Cage workshop, Fumao Fruit shop warehouse, Yongtai firewood shop, and residences of Yin Xinsheng, Chen Azhu, Qian Abaobao, Dai Azhu, and Gong Jintian, among others, as well as the Zhejiang Hotel on Lingqiao Road, the Yibi Qinfeng Southern Goods Store, the Yuan Tai Rice Shop, the Tongsheng Xiang Sesame Oil Shop, the Tianshun Distilling Shop, the Tong 　 Sauce Garden, the Shisheng Hat Shop, the Xiehe Straw Paper Shop, the Xianghe Sauce Garden on Haohe Street, the Taishun Linen Yarn Shop warehouse, the Yifeng Rice Warehouse, the Dingheng Linen Warehouse, and the Henghe Tai Hardware Store, among others, totaling more than 80 rooms, with losses amounting to more than 100,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Homeland Sightseeing Group Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Led by Group Leader Pan Kaixing, a Party of Twenty-Seven People to Stay for a Month, The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau Held a Tea Party Yesterday to Welcome Them</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that the second Homeland Sightseeing Group of the Java Overseas Chinese Youth Association, consisting of twenty-seven people led by Group Leader Pan Kaixing, arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 3:00 PM aboard the Tjisedane ship. They are staying at the New Asia Hotel and plan to stay in the homeland for a month to visit various places. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau held a tea party yesterday to welcome them, and organizations such as the China Children's Welfare Association are scheduled to hold a banquet at noon today. Group Leader Pan spoke about the motives and hopes of the second Homeland Sightseeing, and the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>The Tjisedane ship they were on arrived at the port at about 1:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong. All the group members changed to ferries and arrived at the Jianghai Customs Wharf at about 2:00 PM to disembark. Those who went to welcome them included the director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, Jian Jinglun, receptionist Tan Zhonglu, the Overseas Chinese Cultural Affairs Department of National Jinan University, the South China Overseas Chinese Endeavor Association, the China Children's Welfare Association, the Chinese Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute, the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation, and representatives from more than a hundred Shanghai YMCA and other organizations, holding banners that read "Welcome the Java Overseas Chinese Youth Homeland Sightseeing Group" at the wharf to welcome them. Group Leader Pan Kaixing led the group members to shake hands and thank all the welcoming personnel, and then took cars directly to the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road, and attended the welcome tea party held by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>List of Group Members</p>
<p>Group Leader Pan Kaixing, group members Chen Jianzhang and his wife, Zhao Weilin and his wife, Chen Mianchang and his wife, Lin Shaolu and his wife, Xiao Fengrong and his wife, Yao Ronghui and his wife, Yang Zhongjie and his wife (male), Zhang Yizong, Guo Shenbao, Gao Longxian, Shi Xinjie, Han Quanging, Lin Ganlin, Liao Yuanyuan, Wei Xiaozhang, Chen Zhengui, and females Tang Baoniang, Chen Naizhi, Chen Yangliu, etc., totaling 27 people.</p>
<p>Group Leader's Speech</p>
<p>Group Leader Pan Kaixing said to the Xin Xin News Agency reporter that the Java Overseas Chinese Youth Sightseeing Group had returned to the homeland for inspection once before, and was very excited that various construction projects in the homeland were proceeding in order. Over the years, it must have made rapid progress, so there was a motive to organize a second Homeland Sightseeing Group, hoping to tell the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia about the various progress situations in the country and assist in the development of the homeland. As for the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, there are many of them. In Java alone, there are more than 600,000 people, most of whom are engaged in commerce, followed by agriculture and industry. However, in recent years, due to the cumulative effects, the economic situation of the overseas Chinese has not been as active as before. The overseas Chinese are all hardworking people, so in the face of the current state of decline, they are still working hard to unite and promote revitalization. It is hoped that compatriots in the country will communicate and assist in the progress.</p>

<p>Tea Party Welcomed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau held a tea party at the New Asia Hotel at 5:00 PM yesterday to welcome them. More than 50 people attended, including Jian Jinglun, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, and Group Leader Pan Kaixing of the group, as well as representatives from all group members and various organizations. First, Chairman Jian Jinglun gave a welcome speech, saying that today's tea party was held on behalf of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to welcome the Java Overseas Chinese Youth Homeland Sightseeing Group and express respect. Historically, overseas Chinese have paid close attention to and assisted in the various developments in the homeland. The enthusiasm for donating planes to celebrate birthdays last year is an example of this. It is hoped that overseas Chinese will often organize inspection groups to return to the country for inspection, so that they can promote to overseas Chinese the various construction situations that they have seen on the ground. The group's return to China this time is quite opportune, as the Chinese Art Exhibition has just opened in Beijing. Although this art exhibition is the second of its kind, it represents China's culture for thousands of years and is quite valuable. It is hoped that your group will visit Beijing. Then, Group Leader Pan Kaixing gave a reply speech, saying that he represented all the group members to express his gratitude and thanks for the warm welcome from the compatriots in the country. The overseas Chinese are very concerned about the homeland. This second return to the homeland is entirely to visit the various construction and progress situations in the homeland. It is hoped that compatriots in the country will also often organize inspection groups to inspect the situation of the overseas Chinese in order to seek common development.</p>
<p>Group Banquet</p>
<p>Six charitable organizations, including the China Children's Welfare Association, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Chinese Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute, the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation, and the Shanghai YMCA, believe that the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have always supported and spared no effort in various social causes in the homeland, so they are scheduled to jointly hold a banquet at Yuantuan in Jiangwan at 12:30 PM today to fulfill the responsibility of the host. Organizations such as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and the China National Foreign Trade Association are also preparing to hold a grand welcome and are currently negotiating the date.</p>
<p>Inspection Itinerary</p>
<p>The group plans to stay in the homeland for a month and is scheduled to return to Java from Shanghai on the 20th of next month. The inspection itinerary has been arranged as follows: April 18, arrived in Shanghai; 19, visited the construction of the city center in Shanghai and toured the city; 20, went to Hangzhou at noon; 21 and 22, both in Hangzhou, visiting various scenic spots; 23, returned to Shanghai; 24, in Shanghai, continued to inspect industry and commerce, and visited various organizations; 25, went to Suzhou and Wuxi in the morning to visit; 26, from Wuxi to Nanjing; 27 and 28, both in Beijing, visited the tomb of Premier Sun and visited the construction of the capital; 29, from Beijing to Qufu, Confucius Temple and Mount Tai, etc., for sightseeing; future itineraries will have to wait until after visiting Mount Tai before continuing to book them.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Tram Workers Went on Strike Yesterday Morning, All Routes Suspended</h3>
<p>Because the Company Did Not Agree to New Conditions and Immediate Negotiations, the Party and Government Thoroughly Investigated and Decided on Measures Today</p>
<p>According to the Greater Shanghai News Agency, workers in the vehicle and machinery departments of the British-owned tram company in the Public Concession announced a strike at 6:00 a.m. yesterday due to five new demands that the party and government repeatedly mediated but the company refused to accept. All trolleybuses and trams on all routes were suspended. The police sent detectives to maintain strict vigilance. The party and government authorities consulted on measures to be taken, and will first persuade the workers to resume work and await mediation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiations Break Down</p>
<p>The tram workers originally had five demands, and the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to repeatedly invite labor and management to negotiate. Except for the retirement pay issue, which has been resolved, the remaining clauses have been difficult to resolve due to divergent opinions. The workers, to show their willingness to compromise, declared that they would only insist on: ➀ A raise of two days' pay per month for workers in the machinery department; ➁ An increase of one day's pay per month for drivers who work 25 days or more (for a total of three days, including the previous two days). The management also refused to accept this. The company's general manager, Ivan, also stated that he was about to go abroad and requested that the workers' conditions be discussed again after six months. The workers said they could not accept this, and the negotiations broke down.</p>
<p>Joint Strike</p>
<p>After the breakdown of negotiations, the workers held an emergency representative meeting the night before and decided to strike across the board yesterday morning. Therefore, starting at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, all of the company's trams (Route 1) Jing'an Temple to Park Shooting Range; (Route 2) Jing'an Temple to the Sixteen Pups; (Route 3) McLean Road to East New Bridge; (Route 4) Zongshan Road to Tilanqiao; (Route 5) The French Concession tram originally ran from Old West Gate to the North Railway Station, but due to the tram strike in the Public Concession, the route has been shortened to Old West Gate to East New Bridge; (Route 6) Round Road; (Route 7) North Railway Station to Tilanqiao; (Route 8) Yangshupu to the Sixteen Pups; (Route 12) Jing'an Temple to Tilanqiao, trolleybuses (Route 14) Minguo Road to the North Railway Station; (Route 15) Sanyangjing Bridge to Yuezhou Road; (Route 16) Caojiadu to Minguo Road; (Route 17) Dapu Bridge to Lan Road, Kunming Road; (Route 18) Xieqiao to Yuezhou Road; (Route 19) Minguo Road to Little Shadu; (Route 20) Jing'an Temple to Zhaofeng Park; (Route 21) Gordon Road to Pingliang Road. All vehicles on all routes were suspended. The French Concession trams on Routes 4 and 5, as well as trolleybuses on Routes 47 and 18, were also temporarily not running into the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Party and Government Measures</p>
<p>Since the suspension of trams on all routes, traffic in the city has been extremely inconvenient. Public buses on all routes have suddenly become crowded. The party and government authorities believe that a prolonged stalemate would not only cause losses to both labor and management, but also seriously harm society. Therefore, in addition to sending personnel to investigate the details of the strike, they decided to consult on measures to be taken this morning, and will urge the workers to resume work first in order to seek a proper solution. It is reported that the management has indicated that it can make concessions, while the workers believe that this strike is the third time and insist on not resuming work until their goals are achieved. Therefore, the future of the labor unrest is of great concern.</p>
<p>Police Security</p>
<p>Since the tram workers in the Public Concession put forward five demands, the police have been closely monitoring the trend of negotiations by sending personnel from the Political Department to prevent unforeseen circumstances. Since the labor unrest broke out again yesterday, the police immediately ordered a large number of detectives to go to Hart Road, Wayside Road, and Baker Road, at all tram depots, to maintain order and maintain strict vigilance. The headquarters on North Suzhou Road has also dispatched police detectives for protection. However, the workers have been strictly observing order, except for finding a communication location and waiting for news, and no accidents have occurred.</p>
<p>Petition This Morning</p>
<p>Since the tram workers implemented the joint strike, both party and government agencies and the company have stopped working because it happens to be Sunday. Therefore, the two sides have not conducted negotiations. The workers' attitude is unusually firm in order to implement the demands. If they do not achieve their goals, they will not hesitate to make significant sacrifices. However, in order to resolve the dispute as soon as possible to avoid affecting traffic, they have specifically appointed representatives such as Yang Zhaoyu to go to the Municipal Party Committee, the Social Affairs Bureau, the General Labor Union, and other agencies this morning to petition, requesting practical assistance.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Recovers and Went to the Capital Last Night</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, came to Shanghai from Beijing at the beginning of the month. Due to physical discomfort, he stayed in Shanghai for medical treatment. It is now learned that Mr. Sun has recovered and took the night express train to the capital last night with Ma Chaojun, Shao Lizi, He Yaotsu, Chen Jiliang, Chen Jie, Peng Xuepei, and Sun Lianzhong.</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, and Sun Lianzhong Returned to Shanghai from Ningbo</h3>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, Yu Xuezhong, Commander of the 51st Army, and He Zhuguo, Commander of the Cavalry Army, took the opportunity to attend the funeral of Jiang Xihou in Ningbo. After the matter was completed, they returned to Shanghai by car from Hangzhou at 10:30 p.m. the night before, and met with Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Commission, and Zhu Shaoliang, the newly appointed Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government. The two stayed at the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. It is also reported that Sun Lianzhong, the commander-in-chief of the 26th Route Army, has also returned to Shanghai from Ningbo and returned to the capital that night.</p>
<p>Huang's Banquet: Huang Jinrong, a prominent figure, hosted a special banquet for Yu, He, and Sun at the Huang Family Garden in Caohejing yesterday afternoon. Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Zhinan, and others attended as guests.</p>
<p>Yu's Remarks: According to the Central News Agency, Yu said that his troops had been ordered to be stationed in Anhui Province and were about to complete their deployment. He plans to stay in Shanghai for a while and then go directly to Anhui. The trip to Shaanxi and Gansu has been canceled. It is also learned that Yu will visit Zhu Shaoliang, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, in Shanghai to discuss handover matters. As for all transfer procedures, Yu has already sent personnel to take charge. He will also stay in Shanghai for a day or two before returning to the capital and then to Shaanxi.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan and Others Will Fly to Sichuan This Morning</h3>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the Relief Work Committee, went to Beijing on the 16th to discuss relief measures for the Sichuan-Guizhou earthquake disaster. After meeting with Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, Wei Daoming, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and others, Zhu returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. Zhu said that the Ministry of Finance allocated one million yuan in public bonds for relief of the Sichuan disaster. Now, a deal has been negotiated with Juxingcheng Bank to mortgage the bonds for 714,000 yuan in cash. Therefore, he is scheduled to take the China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Chongqing line aircraft to Sichuan this morning with Secretary Rao Pinqing, Cao Zhonghuan, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, and others to provide relief. According to Zhu's interview with a reporter from the New News Agency, after receiving one million yuan in public bonds from the Ministry of Finance for earthquake relief in Sichuan, he immediately consulted with Ren Shishang, manager of Juxingcheng Bank, to handle the conversion of the bonds into cash. Because the funds were urgently needed, the bank has found a way to convert them into cash, totaling 714,000 yuan, which has been remitted to the Chongqing head office by the bank. Therefore, he will first go to Chongqing to receive the funds from the bank, and then go to Chengdu to meet with the Sichuan provincial authorities to discuss everything. The preliminary plan is to contact the Sichuan provincial authorities and local gentry to organize a large-scale relief association so that personnel can be sent to the disaster areas to conduct on-site investigations and relief. In addition to the one million yuan in public bonds allocated by the Ministry, another one million yuan will be allocated by the Sichuan Provincial Government. He has already consulted with Liu Hangchen, Director of Finance of Sichuan Province in Shanghai, today (18th). Liu advocated that all three million yuan of agricultural loans from the Agricultural Bank of China be used for agricultural loans. As for the provincial government's relief funds, Liu has telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Bank Association to prepare 714,000 yuan from each bank to form 1,428,000 yuan as urgent relief funds. In addition to the special commissioner sent by the Ministry of Finance to supervise the implementation, he has also telegraphed Hong San, the special commissioner sent by the former Executive Yuan to supervise the implementation in Xikang, to go to supervise the implementation nearby. He will stay in Sichuan for about four days, and then fly to Lanzhou, Gansu for inspection. After staying in Gansu for about three days, he will return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Outgoing British Hong Kong Governor Hodejie Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Landed for Sightseeing and Will Leave Shanghai Today</p>
<p>Outgoing British Hong Kong Governor Hodejie returned to China from Hong Kong. He passed through Shanghai on the Japanese Queen Liner of Changxing Branch Company at 6:00 a.m. yesterday. At 8:00 a.m., he landed at the Gonghexiang Wharf on East Broadway Road with his wife. Hodejie had telegraphed Shanghai in advance, stating that this trip was a private action and declined any entertainment. Therefore, no one from any party sent personnel to the wharf to greet him. After Hodejie landed, he visited various places in the city. He returned to the original liner that night and left Shanghai at 2:30 a.m. this morning, taking the route to Canada to return to England. After seeking instructions from the government, he will take up his new position as Governor of Ceylon.</p>
<h3>Yu Feipeng Returned to Shanghai from Ningbo and Went to the Capital</h3>
<p>Yu Feipeng, Minister of Transportation, went to Ningbo a few days ago to attend the funeral of Jiang Xihou. He returned to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday morning and took the military plane to the capital at 4:00 p.m. on the same day to handle departmental affairs.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association Asks Ministry of Finance to Prevent Dumping of Foreign Silk</h3>
<p>Luo Qinghua Has Gone to the Capital to Petition</p>
<p>The Silk and Satin Industry Association believes that the tax rates on rayon and woven products are unbalanced, and foreign silk can be dumped. If we do not seek remedies urgently, the surge will drain the national silk industry, leaving it as dried fish in the market. Luo Qinghua, Chairman of the Association, went to the capital a few days ago to meet with the Ministry of Finance to discuss remedial measures. The reasons given are that the initial import tax on rayon in China was set at 60% ad valorem, and the import tax on woven products was 80% ad valorem. The intention was to make the tax rate on woven products higher than the raw material tax, so as to prevent the domestic sale of foreign silk. The legislation was excellent. However, rayon is taxed by quantity. The price of each box of goods used to be 500 yuan, but now it has fallen to 150 yuan. Because the tariff is based on quantity, it still needs to pay 290 yuan. Its tax rate is almost three times lower than that of woven products. The tariff barrier is counterproductive. Our country's silk industry uses raw materials with a three-fold tax rate to weave goods, and compares them with foreign woven products with 80% ad valorem tax. The selling price is vastly different (the original price of a box of rayon in China is 150 yuan, plus 290 yuan in tariffs, plus 11% profit on rayon, the total cost is 456 yuan. Foreign countries use raw materials worth 150 yuan, plus 80% ad valorem tax of 120 yuan, the total cost is 270 yuan). The breach of defense will lead to a collapse. Last year, a certain country's silk spinning industry has filled the market. In the past three or four months, like bamboo shoots after a rain, the markets in various ports and cities are full of them, dumping goods at low prices. General merchants, because of their cheap prices and good quality, are easy to attract, and act as sacrificial lambs, competing to promote them. At this time when summer goods are just starting, there is a danger of being wiped out by foreign goods in one fell swoop. If measures are not taken urgently to restore the balance of tariffs, the sale of military silk will be bankrupted, and millions of weavers will lose their jobs. The future is dangerous and unimaginable. The Association once sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, requesting a re-imposition of import taxes on woven products. On the one hand, before rayon has its own manufactured products, the import tax will be collected ad valorem. Now, because the matter is significant, it is necessary to not only find ways to prevent the invasion of foreign silk, but also to consider the consequences of rejecting a tiger and introducing a wolf. Therefore, they made a special trip to the capital to discuss the matter at length.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank Held Annual Shareholders Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank on Ningbo Road held its annual shareholders' meeting. More than 200 shareholders attended, holding more than 15,000 shares, which was sufficient for the statutory quorum. The meeting was then rung to order. Mr. Jin Boping, a director, represented the chairman of the board and delivered an opening speech. Then, Mr. Yang Jiemi, a managing director, represented the general manager and reported on the business situation of the 25th year.

<h3>Zhabei Water and Electricity Company Held Annual Shareholders Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Actively Expanding Both Water and Electricity Sections, Directors and Supervisors Re-elected After Term Expiration</p>
<p>The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company held its 13th Annual Shareholders Meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association yesterday, and also held a joint 3rd Additional Capital Increase Shareholders Meeting. A total of 258,415 shares were represented, totaling 235,740 votes. The meeting opened at 2:00 p.m. Le Zhenbao was elected as the chairman. After announcing the opening of the meeting, the supervisors first reported on the capital increase situation, and then the general manager Lu Bohong reported on the business situation. He said,</p>
<p>The business of our company in the 25th year can be divided into three stages. The first half of the year was affected by the decline of various industries last year, and the business was even worse than that of the 24th year. This was a period of hesitation. In the second half of the year, the market was active, various industries made rapid progress, and factories were operating day and night, so the demand for electricity suddenly increased. This was a period of development. In the autumn, it was affected by local rumors, and at the beginning of winter, the Xi'an Incident occurred. Residents moved away, and industrial demand declined. This was an unexpected period. Although the changes in one year were different, the policy of progress remained the same. The total business revenue for the whole year was still higher than last year, which is gratifying to all shareholders.</p>
<p>The business and engineering of the water and electricity sections can also be roughly described separately. Although the demand for water did not reach the expected level, due to the increase in demand last year, the original water production of the water plant was about to be exceeded, so preparations had to be made in advance. Therefore, the water plant expansion project determined last year began construction in early March, including a settling tank, four rapid filtration tanks, a water tower, and a 900-kilometer trunk line. All of these can be completely completed before the summer of the 26th year, to meet the increased demand during the hot summer. After this expansion, the daily water output can be increased by more than 36,000 cubic meters. In view of the business situation in the 25th year, it is necessary to promote outlets to digest this new water output. Therefore, it was decided to expand the water supply on Zhongshan Road. There are many factories and residents are increasing there. It is expected that after the pipe water supply, it will definitely enhance the business.</p>
<p>In the electrical section, in the second half of the year, the demand from various factories suddenly increased, and the maximum load jumped to more than 29,000 kilowatts. Fortunately, the Guangchong project decided last year was carried out as scheduled. A new 14,000-kilowatt turbine generator, two boilers with a steam output of 50 tons per hour, and other equipment were installed and tested before the end of the year, so that they could cope with the sudden increase in demand without being caught off guard. There is still one boiler that will be installed in the 26th year. At the same time, in order to promote business, the pole line supplying power to Jiafeng Textile Factory was used to sign a contract with Jiading Huaxing Yongji Electric Light Factory to supply power to the factory, which has been implemented. The Nanshang Shengming Electric Company is also being powered by our company, and negotiations have matured. A new Yinghua area is being expanded in the Pu Song area of ​​West Shanghai, which has been approved by the competent authorities. The convenience of the location and the company's business are mutually beneficial. However, in view of the past situation, the demand for electricity has continued to increase. Therefore, in the 26th year, the second phase of the power plant expansion plan was decided again, and another 14,000-kilowatt turbine generator was purchased, which is in progress. It is expected that after the completion of the second phase of expansion, it can be handled with ease in three or four years, without fear of being exhausted. This is a general overview of the business and engineering of the water and electricity sections.</p>
<p>The company's efforts have won the government's commendation and the investors' trust. The Construction Committee has awarded an honorary certificate, and it has been awarded for five consecutive years up to this session. The increase in capital has proceeded smoothly each time. The one million yuan for the third capital increase has been fully collected, and the company bonds issued for the second time have also been fully subscribed, making the company's economy stable. Although the business revenue of this session has increased compared with last year, most of the increase is electricity, which is extremely low in cost. The electricity price has also been reduced in this session, so the profit is thinner. Since the company is determined to assist industry and commerce, it should have a long-term vision and strive for prosperity with various industries, without being obsessed with its own self-interest, which should be approved by all shareholders.</p>
<p>The supervisors then reported on the accounts, passed the profit distribution and two amendment proposals, and finally elected directors and supervisors. The results of the vote were: Lu Bohong, Shi Shengzhi, Qian Xinzhi, Feng Bingnan, Le Zhenbao, Xu Xinliu, Wang Zisong, Zhu Shoucheng, Chen Fanqian, Zhang Yunbo, Xu Chunrong, Shi Bingzhi, Zhu Kongjia, Lu Zidong, and Shen Lianfang were elected as directors. Shi Boqun, Wang Yunfu, Xu Qianlin, Li Jisheng, and Liu Pinsan were elected as supervisors. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m. It was also learned that the company's dividends and bonuses for the 25th year will be issued starting on May 10th of this year.</p>

<h3>Various Chinese Goods Organizations Jointly Request Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>Submitted to Foreign Minister Wang</p>
<p>Various organizations in the city, including the Federation of Chinese National Products Manufacturers, the National Goods Consumption Association, the Shanghai National Goods Promotion Association, the Federation of Citizens of the First Special Zone, and the National Goods Movement Committee, jointly submitted a petition to Foreign Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that in order to implement the central government's resolution, they requested the speedy declaration of the abolition of consular jurisdiction of various countries in China in order to restore national rights and comfort the people. Since the Opium War, foreign disasters have been pressing down on us, and various countries have forced us to sign unequal treaties, among which the most damaging to our national sovereignty is consular jurisdiction. Those unscrupulous foreigners in China use consular jurisdiction as a shield to openly act out of bounds and humiliate Chinese people, or harbor smugglers, or traffic in drugs. If they are reported, they are not subject to trial under our country's laws and can still escape justice. As a result, social tranquility and the national economy are all adversely affected. At the Washington Conference, the Chinese representatives stated the harms and negotiated for abolition, but although various countries organized inspection teams to come to China to investigate the judiciary, no results were achieved. This year, the central government held the Third Plenary Session and paid special attention to this, and made a resolution to abolish consular jurisdiction of various countries in China. Today, our country's unification has been completed, and the judicial system is improving day by day, which is proven by the facts. The excuse of judicial misconduct no longer exists. Therefore, we specifically request Your Excellency to uphold the legacy of abolishing unequal treaties, based on the resolution of the Third Plenary Session, and proceed with negotiations to abolish consular jurisdiction of various countries in China. If there are those who do not understand our country's situation and attempt to obstruct it, we especially hope that you will resolutely declare abolition on your own initiative with the spirit of revolutionary diplomacy in order to restore national rights and comfort the people. We are deeply grateful.</p>

<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Labor Unrest at a Stalemate</h3>
<p>Appeal Case May Be Approved Today or Tomorrow, Zhenhua and Three Other Factories Strike Again</p>
<p>According to the Dagon Company, the labor unrest in the silk weaving industry in this city has not yet stabilized. Strikes and slowdowns have occurred one after another in silk factories in various districts. The municipal government's appeal to the industry association may be approved today or tomorrow, and the original method determined by the Social Affairs Bureau will be followed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meiya and Other Factories Are Still at a Stalemate</p>
<p>After the Shanghai silk factory labor-management dispute was resolved by the Social Affairs Bureau, the workers had complied with the order to resume work. Half a month has passed, but the management has not yet accepted the expression and has filed an appeal to the municipal government requesting the withdrawal of the order, which has aroused the anger of the workers. The workers of Meiya Jingwei Factory and the General Factory first went on strike and petitioned the party and government, but there was no result. Later, Meiya's weaving factories announced a shutdown due to a lack of raw materials. The workers in each factory requested that they be ordered to start work, but there was no result. The labor attitude is currently very strong. If the management does not accept the method approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, they are afraid of resuming work. Therefore, the current situation is still at a stalemate.</p>
<p>Zhenye and Other Factories Announce Strikes</p>
<p>Zhenye Weaving Factory, No. 689 Baker Road, Pudong, with more than 400 workers, is one of the largest silk factories in the city. On the afternoon of the 19th, the workers went on strike because the factory refused to implement the conditions approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. The management tried to persuade people to mediate, but the workers were determined that there was no possibility of negotiation because the factory did not accept the government's order, so there was no result. The workers petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau the day before, requesting strict orders for the management to comply with the compromise method. Zhang Chuqiang met them and promised to forward the request to the director for verification and order the workers to resume work first. The workers expressed dissatisfaction and are currently continuing their strike. Also, Yi Xin and Yue Ping two silk factories on Xietu Road in South Shanghai also went on strike the day before due to the same reason, and negotiations have not yet yielded results.</p>
<p>The Dispute Between Fuxing and Puyi is Resolved</p>
<p>Fuxing Silk Weaving Factory on Bailinan Road, West Shanghai, with more than 400 workers, once went on strike the day before due to requests for implementation of conditions and subsidies, and the transformation of tools. After the dispatch of personnel by the Third District Silk Weaving Trade Union, it was agreed that the workers in the preparatory department would receive a subsidy of 27 cents per day, and the workers in the weaving department would receive a subsidy of 30 cents per day. All other conditions were implemented in accordance with the order, and the dispute was resolved. The workers also worked as usual yesterday morning. Also, more than 500 workers in Puyi and Tongyi Silk Factory on Xiaoshadu Road also announced a slowdown starting at 4:00 p.m. the day before because they requested the implementation of the conditions approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. The night workers did not enter the factory. The Puto Road Police Station and personnel from the First District Labor Union were dispatched to jointly mediate and persuade the workers to resume work immediately. Wages will be paid as usual during the slowdown. The Social Affairs Bureau approved the conditions, and the factory agreed to investigate within March. If other factories have already implemented them, they will be paid the same. The workers expressed their acceptance and resumed work at noon yesterday.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Decides to Maintain the Order</p>
<p>The compromise method proposed by the Social Affairs Bureau in this labor unrest takes into account both sides and is extremely fair. However, both labor and management were dissatisfied in the past, but the labor side has complied with the order to resume work. However, the management has not yet agreed to accept it and has filed an appeal to the municipal government requesting further mediation and has notified all member factories that they must not implement it alone. After delaying for half a month, it has aroused the resentment of the workers, and strikes and slowdowns have occurred one after another. There is a possibility that the labor unrest will expand again. The Social Affairs Bureau has already replied to the appeal and requested that the municipal government maintain the original proposal. After the mayor heard the report, he invited opinions from all parties and believed that the labor unrest should be resolved quickly in order to protect the budding national industry and take care of social security and the people's livelihoods. Therefore, it was decided to maintain the Social Affairs Bureau's order to quell the labor unrest. Yesterday was Sunday and offices were closed. The order will be issued today or tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Young Man in Western Suit Impersonates Yu Xuezhong's Eldest Son</h3>
<p>Dares to Swindle in Minhang; Car Overturns in Ditch Due to Careless Driving</p>
<p>At 1 PM the day before yesterday, a young man in a Western suit, driving a car with municipal license plate 7735, rented license plate 7957, arrived at the Shanghai-Minhang Company on Guohuo Road in the South City, seeking out Ge Zimin, a Shandong driver from the No. 2 car. Because Ge was in Minhang, he drove the car to Minhang to find Ge, but Ge was not there. Ge's wife asked about his intentions, and he claimed to be the eldest son of Yu Xuezhong, commander of the 51st Army. He said he wanted to buy a new car, so he came to find Ge and falsely claimed that Ge's aunt was seriously ill in Shanghai and suggested that she take his car to visit her. Ge's wife declined because she had just come from the countryside. Unable to achieve his goal, he claimed that he had not brought any money and planned to buy something else in Minhang, so he asked to borrow a few yuan, promising to return it when Ge came to his residence. Ge's wife then asked Cheng Tonglu, a porter at the station, to borrow nine yuan in national currency from the accounting office, and Cheng accompanied him on a tour of the town. At 4 PM, he got into the car and drove back to Shanghai. However, while driving south of the Tongqiao station, due to lack of skill, the car overturned into a ditch by the roadside. The two people in the car both suffered facial injuries. At the time, the station staff still thought he was the real Yu's son and helped rescue the people, taking them to a nearby sanatorium for treatment. They then notified the Minhang station to send someone to tow the vehicle. After the injured were bandaged by the doctor, they hired another car to take them to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment. The driver was sent away first, and then he took the opportunity to escape. Later, when the driver returned, intending to drive the car back, he realized that he had been tricked by an imposter. The Shanghai County Public Security Bureau detained him. However, when questioning the driver, he seemed unaware and possibly had been deceived himself. After contacting the Yu residence, they were informed that the son was only five years old. The car is currently being held at the county government, and the driver has been released on bail while the origin of the car is being investigated.</p>

<p>Ma Mingyi, a 22-year-old worker from Nanjing at the China Egg Factory at 501 Minhang Road, fell from the elevator gap while working on the third floor of the factory at 12:20 PM the day before yesterday. At the time, approximately 300 pounds of almonds were being loaded onto the elevator, and Ma planned to carry the heavy load out of the elevator. For the convenience of carrying, the driver had raised the elevator about two feet. However, as Ma was bending over to carry the large bag, he could not bear the weight of the load and fell through the elevator gap, suffering severe injuries. The factory quickly sent him to Tongren Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he died shortly after. The body was taken to the forensic center on Feilun Road. The Hongkou police station ordered Detective Chen Dabao to investigate. Yesterday morning, the First Special Court dispatched Prosecutor Zhang Zongru to the center to confirm the cause of death.

She was housed in Xuxing Lane in the Japanese concession. Chen Xiaowuzi then sold Xiao Chengbao into prostitution. Xiao Chengbao vowed not to comply. The brothel owner, because Xiao Chengbao refused to receive guests, returned her to Chen Xiaowuzi, who brought Xiao Chengbao back to Shanghai to find another buyer. However, Xiao Chengbao, realizing that she had arrived in Shanghai, escaped back home like a bird freed from its cage and told her parents, who reported the matter to the police. Chen Gezi was arrested and brought before the local court, while Chen Xiaowuzi fled. Prosecutor Jiang prosecuted him for abduction. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Wang Shanxiang. Xiao Chengbao, accompanied by her mother, Xiao Cao, testified to the previous events. Chen Gezi vehemently denied the charges, claiming they were malicious accusations. Finally, witnesses Qi Amao and Tang Cailian testified that they had seen Chen Gezi taking Xiao Chengbao to the hotel. The judge, finding the facts clear, immediately announced the verdict: Chen Gezi was found guilty of joint abduction, but in consideration of the fact that the victim was a woman, he was sentenced to three months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>

The embassy should do its best to assist, but the credibility of these businesses and the reliability of their products have a significant impact on international trade. It is proposed that the relevant authorities be consulted and that all exporters seeking assistance from embassies and consulates be required to submit their requests through the relevant authorities for review and transmission in order to ensure standardization.' After reviewing the original report, it is deemed to be reasonable. Therefore, the relevant consular report is being forwarded to your ministry for review and handling." Based on this, it is noted that many members have requested consulates to introduce trade. As domestic goods are becoming increasingly developed, the number of requests for consulates to introduce overseas trade will inevitably increase. For the convenience of the consulates in managing this, all members who intend to promote trade overseas in the future should submit their requests to the Ministry of Industry's International Trade Bureau for review and transmission to ensure proper procedure and facilitate sales. You are hereby notified to comply accordingly.</p>

<h3>Prosecutor Requests Severe Sentence in Xu Hongshou's Case of Rape of a Young Girl</h3>
<p>Xing Meimei Has Not Yet Developed; Trial Concludes, Verdict to Be Announced on the 22nd</p>
<p>Xing Meimei, the ten-year-old daughter of Xing Zhigang, who owns a clock and watch shop in Sanguantang, Tangqiao, Pudong, was allegedly lured to the attic and raped by his eighteen-year-old apprentice, Xu Hongshou, on March 18th of this year. Xing discovered the act and reported it to the police, who arrested Xu Hongshou. The Tangqiao police station transferred the case to the local court. Prosecutor Kong Xianglin investigated the case. The plaintiff claimed that there was only one instance of rape. However, a forensic examination revealed traces of more than ten instances of rape, even the hymen had been ruptured. The girl stated that she had been raped more than ten times since January of this year, or the twelfth lunar month of last year. The defendant, however, firmly denied the charges. The prosecutor stated that the facts were clear and there was no room for denial. He filed a public prosecution for the crime of rape of a minor. Because the main punishment in this case is severe, the court specifically appointed a pro bono lawyer, Liu Xiang, to defend him. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Chen. The plaintiff and Xing Meimei both claimed that there was only one instance of rape. The defendant still denied the charges. The prosecutor, based on the facts and the victim's testimony, requested a severe sentence. The defense lawyer, based on the defendant's defense, argued that Xing Zhigang had a feud with the defendant and was venting his anger by injuring his daughter with his fingers and framing the defendant. He argued that a ten-year-old girl who had not yet developed could not have been sexually violated by a man more than ten times. The court concluded the debate and will announce the verdict on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Reporters Association Requests Municipal Government to Thoroughly Investigate Case of Police Officer Assaulting Reporter</h3>

On the 17th, the association received a letter from the Sixteenth Precinct stating that the officer responsible for maintaining traffic that day was a supervisor dispatched by the Municipal Police Headquarters and not an officer directly under the jurisdiction of the precinct. That evening, the association received reports from members of various newspapers stating that the Municipal Police Department had sent letters to each newspaper stating that an investigation had been conducted and that nothing had occurred. On the 18th, the association received a letter from member Zhai Yicheng, providing a supplementary account of the incident. The association immediately convened an emergency executive meeting that day (the 18th). It was decided to submit a request to the Municipal Government to dispatch personnel to conduct a fair and thorough investigation to ensure the convenience of journalists exercising their duties.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Department's Sixteenth Precinct sent a letter, stating: "We have read the news item in your newspaper entitled 'Police Officer from Sixteenth Precinct Assaults Journalist.' The content is inconsistent with the facts. On that day, all traffic matters were placed under special guard, and a supervisor dispatched by headquarters was in charge of directing traffic. The journalist attempted to enter the restricted area and was explained to and persuaded by the supervisor, which led to a misunderstanding. This is a matter within the supervisor's authority and responsibility, and this precinct cannot arbitrarily interfere. Furthermore, the supervisor is not a direct subordinate of this precinct. How could we have the ability to allow the supervisor to assault the journalist? In addition to reporting the facts of the day to headquarters, we fear that the outside world may misunderstand the truth. Therefore, we are sending this letter to request a correction. To the Shen Bao Newspaper, from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department's Sixteenth Precinct, April 18th."</p>
<h3>Zhang Afeng, Waitress at the Great New World, Suspected of Bigamy Due to Husband's Poverty</h3>
<p>Denies Marriage Relationship with Shi; Shi Presents Evidence of Marriage</p>
<p>Zhang Afeng, a first-class waitress (commonly known as a "glass cup") at the Great New World Entertainment Center, enjoying a reputation as one of the top beauties, unwilling to be harmonious with her rustic husband, Shi Lianfa, in her ultra-modern identity, used her opportunity and skills in entertaining guests to fall in love with and commit herself to Zeng Rongzhang, a wealthy soy sauce merchant. On December 8th of last year, they formally held their wedding ceremony, thinking that their love would finally be fulfilled. However, the beautiful scene did not last long. Shi discovered the affair and sued her in the local court, ordering Zhang Afeng to post bail and indicting her for bigamy. Zeng Rongzhang, not knowing about the previous marriage, was investigated by Judge Bai Dongling. Zhang Afeng denied any marital relationship with Shi, claiming that she had only been raped by Shi once in an attempt to extort money, leading to the lawsuit. However, Shi Lianfa presented evidence of their marriage. Therefore, the judge determined that Zhang Afeng was guilty of bigamy due to her husband's poverty and sentenced her to four months of imprisonment in court. She is currently within the appeal period and has been released on the original bail.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Association Cables Zhejiang Provincial Government to Relieve Panic Over Silkworm Feeding</h3>
<p>Sudden and Rapid Increase in Silkworm Egg Hatching This Year; Panic Inevitable Due to Peak Leaf-Eating Season; Two Suggestions Proposed for Adoption and Implementation</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Association cabled the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday to request relief from the panic over mulberry leaves, stating: "To Zhu Junjian, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, our Zhejiang Province has always been a prosperous region for sericulture. Since the drastic drop in overseas silk prices, silkworm farmers have viewed raising silkworms as a daunting task and no longer</p>
<p>pay attention to planting mulberry trees</p>
<p>leaving them barren and uncultivated, with no efforts to cultivate them. The good mulberry forests have gradually become bare. Our association believes that sericulture is a natural benefit to our country. In the autumn of the year before last, we requested the former provincial government to issue an order to all counties, stating that the silk market was gradually improving and that sericulture would surely recover. We advised farmers to fertilize and replant their existing mulberry gardens to meet the needs of feeding silkworms and composed a</p>
<p>song to encourage farmers</p>
<p>describing the possibility of sericulture recovering, distributing and posting it as encouragement. However, considering the ten-year plan of planting trees, it is impossible to restore the once lush and verdant appearance of the mulberry trees, which are gradually withering, overnight. Last year, silkworm farmers, bearing the burden of years of failure, did not have a strong interest in raising silkworms, and the harvest was only moderately good. Therefore, the</p>
<p>supply of mulberry leaves</p>
<p>was still able to meet the demand. This year, there has been a sudden and rapid increase, with improved breeds of silkworm eggs hatching, increasing by 20% compared to last year. The native species are also showing similar trends. However, the mulberry leaves, which are essential for feeding, are far from as abundant as in the past. With the arrival of the peak leaf-eating season, it is inevitable that a</p>
<p>shortage will occur</p>
<p>leaf prices will skyrocket, and the costs will outweigh the benefits. The future of silkworm feeding is deeply worrying. Our association, deeply concerned about local affairs, has the following suggestions for relieving the leaf shortage: ㊀ Based on the silkworm season in various regions, which varies due to differences in climate, soil, and customs, some are earlier and some are later. For example, in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing area, Yuhang is the earliest, followed by Haining and Xiashi, and then Jiaxing and other regions. After the</p>
<p>silkworm season ends early</p>
<p>there are still surplus leaves in some areas. Qingyunqiao, Xieqiao, and Guodian, in particular, have always been known as leaf mountains. In the past, merchants would often transport leaves to the lower reaches to sell. Due to the inconvenience of transportation in the past, there was often a lament that goods were abandoned on the ground. It is proposed that the Construction Department be ordered to consult with the Sericulture Control Association to borrow the remaining funds from the improvement fund and dispatch personnel to the counties with abundant leaves to</p>
<p>purchase them separately</p>
<p>(or have the county guidance offices take on the responsibility). At the same time, the Highway Bureau should be ordered to provide 20 designated vehicles to transport the leaves in batches daily to areas lacking leaves for sale. The route from Yuhang to Jiaxing is the longest, and it is estimated that two round trips can be made daily. This will ensure that market prices are stabilized and prevent price gouging or speculation, and the silkworm feeding can be assured. ㊀ To fundamentally revitalize the sericulture industry, it is necessary to promote mulberry planting, especially relying on high-quality mulberry seedlings to ensure vigorous growth. In recent years, due to the low value of mulberry leaves,</p>
<p>the planting of mulberry seedlings</p>
<p>has also been affected. It is proposed that the Control Association prepare millions of mulberry seedlings and distribute them to the counties for distribution to farmers. At the same time, consult with various banks to provide loans for farmers to purchase mulberry seedlings for replanting. It is also necessary to encourage them to apply more fertilizer, cultivate diligently, and increase production so that the benefits of mulberry planting can gradually develop, especially for the revival of the rural areas, which will be greatly beneficial. Respectfully hoping that the Honorable Chairman, with deep concern for the people's livelihood, will pay special attention to improving the sericulture industry. Are these humble suggestions feasible? We earnestly hope that you will review them and adopt them. We will be infinitely grateful. Shanghai Zhejiang Provincial Association respectfully.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement Case of Detective</h3>
<p>Public Trial to be Held Tomorrow for the Third Time</p>
<p>Liu Bingyuan, the leader of the Zhabei Sixth Squad of the Municipal Police Department's Detective General Team, and detectives Miao Yizhong, Wu Songshan, and others, were previously sued by Ruan Defu, who owns a leather goods and sundries shop at No. 119 Xinmin Road in the Shanghai Local Court, for embezzling money under false pretenses of official duties. The prosecutor has filed a public prosecution, and Judge Li Xuedeng has held two public trials on March 23rd and April 2nd. However, due to insufficient evidence, it was ruled that further summons and investigations were needed and the date for the hearing was postponed. It has now been learned that the court has issued subpoenas to the plaintiff, defendant, witnesses, and related parties, scheduling the third public trial for 9 AM on the 20th of this month (i.e., tomorrow). The previous trial had a full audience, and a large number of attendees are expected this time as well.</p>
<h3>Forged Receipts and Stamps: Wu Yongsheng and Others Defraud for Money</h3>
<p>Defrauding Various Associations of Membership Fees</p>
<p>Wu Yongsheng from Anhui, colluded with Wang Yuming from Pinghu around January of this year, forging receipts for the Civic National Goods Promotion Association located at 47 Gaodun Street, Ji畝地, Huajie. They privately carved a seal and defrauded Hengyi Sheng Department Store on Wusong Road, Hua Feng Cotton Weaving Factory on Qipu Road, Puqiu Hardware Store on Fujian Road, Yuhua Mirror Store on Tiantong Road, and other businesses, collecting over 頁 yuan in membership fees, which they divided and spent. On February 3rd, Wu was arrested by Feng Qishan, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, and taken to the Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Subsequently, Detective Feng discovered that Wang had committed the same crime at the Chinese District Court and was sentenced to three months in prison. He then sent an official letter to have Wu transferred to the Criminal Court III. After an interrogation, Wu was returned to the police station. The other day, Wu and Wang were both escorted to court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, prosecuted them under Article 210 of the Criminal Code for forging documents and obtaining property by fraud, requesting an investigation. When questioned, the two defendants stammered in their testimonies. Judge Xiao ordered them to be remanded in custody and scheduled a sentencing date.</p>
<h3>Chen Tingbiao Loses Thousands of Yuan Gambling on "Turn-Over Game," Seeks Justice</h3>
<p>Defendants Fail to Appear; Chen Requests Suspension of Trial</p>
<p>There is a group in Shanghai known as the "Turn-Over Game" gang, specializing in luring people into gambling. They use dice filled with lead or cards with pre-made marks to cheat people out of their money. They are commonly referred to as "Ground Measurements." Chen Tingbiao, residing at No. 15 Yujia Lane, Rue Wagner, in the French Concession, was invited by Hu Aqing, Ren Ajiu, Zhou Mingde, Zhao Zhiquan, and others on March 1st this year to gamble on Pai Gow in Room 207 of the Paramount Hotel on Yuyuan Road. They gambled for five consecutive days, and Chen lost every time. In total, he lost about 800 yuan in cash and owed 200 yuan. He pawned a diamond ring worth 300 yuan. On the 6th, they continued to gamble, but Chen discovered obvious patterns on the cards, which were the so-called "disordered muscle cards." He realized he had been cheated and immediately seized sixteen cards. He negotiated with Hu and the others. At that time, the Paramount Hotel hastily closed its iron gate. After mediation, everyone dispersed. Now, Chen is unwilling to accept this and has hired lawyer Li Zhongwen to file a criminal lawsuit against Hu and the other four in the Special District Court for fraudulent acquisition of property. He also filed a civil lawsuit, demanding the return of the 808 yuan in cash that was cheated and the diamond ring worth 300 yuan. The other day, Judge Pan Zhenyang of the Special District Court opened the Criminal Court V to summon the defendants Hu Aqing, Ren Ajiu, Zhou Mingde, and Zhao Zhiquan, but none of them appeared. The plaintiff's agent, lawyer Li Zhongwen, immediately requested that the case be suspended. Judge Pan approved the request and ruled that the trial would be suspended.</p>

<h3>Mongolian-Chahar-Suiyuan Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition Closes Tonight</h3>
<p>The Mongolian-Chahar-Suiyuan Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition has been open for six days. Yesterday was Sunday, and despite the bad weather, over a thousand people still braved the rain to visit. Many Japanese civilians and European and American expatriates also attended. Foreign reporters made detailed interviews, demonstrating the importance attached to Mr. Shen's works by various circles at home and abroad. Furthermore, Hu Pu'an, the president of Minbao News Agency, Zhang Zhiben, a member of the Central Committee, and Jiang Jianbai, the section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, also visited the exhibition and wrote inscriptions. Several works in the exhibition, such as "Zou Erdos' Pastoral Record" and "A Shepherdess," as well as "The Conscripts on Hui Tengliang," were booked. It is regrettable that many of the works in the exhibition were not for sale, with only about fifty pieces being priced for sale. People who admire Mr. Shen's works consider this a pity. It is reported that the exhibition will close tonight, and the crowds on the fourth floor of the Da Xin Company can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Trial of Manslaughter from Debt Collection Gambling Brawl: Clear Examination, Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>Four Released as Unrelated; Chen Yousheng and Others Remanded</p>
<p>Cai Huazai, a member of the Qunyi Triad at No. 30 Shishan Lane, Rue Seward, had a dispute with A Li, a Cantonese member of the Hua Lian Triad at No. 9 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, and Chen Yousheng from Jiangxi, over collecting a gambling debt of one yuan from a prostitute named A Tang at No. 15 Jiugeng Lane, Rue Pottier. They parted in resentment. At 9:50 PM on the 6th of this month, both sides gathered over a dozen thugs each, armed with axes, knives, and clubs, and engaged in a brawl near Route des Haies and Miller Road. As a result, Chen Xiaoheizi, a 19-year-old Cantonese man from Cai Huazai's side, was stabbed in the chest with a triangular bayonet, fell to the ground, and died. Subsequently, Feng Qi and Bai Mingfu, Chinese detectives from the Hongkou Police Station, and Special Agent Tehua arrived at the scene upon hearing the alarm and arrested seven people, including Chen Yousheng's assistant Zhan Xuying, Cai Huazai, and suspects Lu Axiang from Ningbo, Zhu Tingfang, Li Guoxiang from Guangdong, and Huo Yulin, along with the murder weapons, and sent them to the Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Judge Xiao Xiexuan of Criminal Court III continued the trial. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated that after an interim change, it was clarified that the four suspects, Lu, Zhu, Li, and Huo, were not related to the case and requested that they be released first. The court approved the request. Judge Xiao found the testimonies of the defendants Chen Yousheng, Zhan Guanying, and Cai Huazai clear and ordered them to be remanded in custody, awaiting sentencing.</p>
<h3>Trademark Infringement Lawsuit for Underwear: Civil Claim for Damages Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>Xinguang Standard Underwear Company Manufacturing Factory, located at No. 13, Lane 26, Rue Lubin, French Concession, has a distribution office at No. 473 Avenue Joffre. The factory produces various types of underwear, which are sold both domestically and abroad with a good reputation. The trademark used by the factory has been registered and approved by the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for exclusive use, prohibiting imitation. Recently, Huajiao Hosiery Factory, located at No. 47 Route Cardinal Mercier, Ba Xian Qiao, was found to be counterfeiting Xinguang's registered trademark by selling its own inferior products on the market. After customers notified the police station, Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to search Huajiao Hosiery Factory and confiscated counterfeit underwear and counterfeit labels. Manager Zhang Chulin was sent to the Second Special District Court, where the French Police Department filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. The plaintiff, Xinguang Underwear Company, also hired a lawyer to file an ancillary civil suit, seeking compensation for damages, including six months of business losses and the cost of publishing advertisements to restore its reputation, totaling 5,675 yuan. The result was a judgment that Zhang Chulin was fined 400 yuan for counterfeiting another person's registered trademark, and the counterfeit underwear and labels were confiscated. The ancillary civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court. Now, the manager of Xinguang Standard Underwear Company has hired lawyers Tu Zhengui and Wu Xiangxian to file a separate lawsuit for damages against Zhang Chulin of Huajiao Hosiery Factory in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court. The amount is the same as the amount presented in the Criminal Court. The court accepted the lawsuit and summoned both parties to court the other day. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff's side stated the facts, reasons, and objectives of the lawsuit. Then, the defendant's side stated that they denied the counterfeiting and that the first instance judgment in the criminal case was currently under appeal, and the judgment had not yet been finalized. Regarding the civil case, they requested that it be suspended in accordance with Article 183 of the Civil Procedure Law. The court, after reviewing the situation, ruled that the case would be investigated and re-examined at a later date.</p>
<h3>Wu Yaozong and Zhao Sihong Gather Crowds for a Bloody Brawl</h3>
<p>A Jocular Remark Turns into Resentment; Police Station Should Investigate</p>
<p>Wu Yaozong, over 30 years old and nicknamed "Chicken Feather Girl," the owner of the First Teahouse across from the Qiujiang Bridge Small Vegetable Market in Zhabei, is a well-known hooligan. Last autumn, he led his followers to hack Nantong native Cheng Liuming with axes and was wanted by the police. Wu fled to another port to evade punishment but recently returned secretly, claiming to be a detective team member of the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, wearing a pistol and swaggering through the streets, boasting to his peers. Around 3:00 AM the other morning, Wu encountered Zhao Sihong, a native of Yangzhou whom he knew, at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Old Baz Road. They exchanged jokes, but Wu suddenly became angry and fired a shot. Fortunately, Zhao was alert and ran away. Then, both sides displayed their power and gathered over forty followers each, armed with pistols and axes, and engaged in a brawl. As a result, four or five people were injured on each side and bleeding profusely. They each hired cars to take them to the hospital, and the crowd dispersed. Until yesterday morning, both sides gathered again at the First Teahouse, intending to brawl again. The number of people gathered grew to over 110, blocking the road. The North Sichuan Road Police Station dispatched a large number of police officers to rush to the scene, and the crowd dispersed. The police station is currently investigating.</p>
<h3>Ma Lin to Return to His Post</h3>
<p>Ma Lin, the chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai by train the other evening after passing through Ningbo and Hangzhou, and stayed at the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. According to Tan Kemin, the secretary-general of the Qinghai Provincial Government, speaking to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, Chairman Ma will stay in Shanghai for a day or two and then go to Beijing to return to Qinghai after taking leave. Ma's epilepsy, which he had been suffering from, has been cured after treatment in Shanghai. It has not recurred in the past few months abroad. Also, Ma Zhanshan returned to Shanghai from Ningbo the other evening.</p>
<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A (20)</h3>
<p>Question: Mr. Xia Cheng from Nanjing asks: I would like to send printed matter to a bookstore in the United States. I don't know how many stamps to attach in the letter. If I attach Chinese stamps, can the United States use them (referring to using them to pay the postage for the printed matter sent from the United States to China)? If they cannot be used and I need to attach American stamps, I don't know where I can buy American stamps in China. Also, the American currency system is different from ours. Is one cent of an American stamp equal to one cent in our country when used?</p>
<p>Answer: The postage depends on the weight. The postage for printed matter sent from the United States to China is 1.5 US cents for every 90 grams. US stamps should be attached. Stamps from other countries cannot be used. Also, our country's and the United States' currency systems are different, and the value of the two countries' stamps is naturally not equal. There is also nowhere to buy American stamps in China. However, the Chinese Post Office, in accordance with the regulations of the Universal Postal Convention, prints an international reply coupon, which is sold at post offices and is specially used for situations like the one you described. If you buy one and attach it in the letter, the bookstore can take it to the US post office and exchange it for one or several US stamps, the total value of which is equal to the postage that should be paid for an ordinary letter weighing no more than 20 grams sent from the United States to China, which is 5 US cents. If the printed matter you are requesting weighs less than 150 grams, it will be enough to pay the postage.</p>
<p>Or someone asks: I am studying in Beijing and my home is in Ba County, Sichuan. The other day, because I urgently needed money, I telegraphed home to remit money. My family heard that postal airmail remittances could arrive on the same day, so in the morning, I bought a remittance order at the Ba County Post Office using the usual procedure and enclosed it in a letter as airmail to Beijing. After arriving in Beijing in the afternoon, I rushed to the Beijing Post Office before 5:00 to cash the money. However, the post office said that the stub had not arrived and could not be cashed at that time, and a stamp was affixed on the remittance order saying, "This is an ordinary remittance order sent by airmail and must be paid only after verification of the certificate (i.e., the stub) has arrived." I don't know why.</p>
<p>Answer: The remittance order you purchased is an ordinary remittance order that you sent in an airmail letter. It is not a special airmail remittance order provided by the post office. The procedures for the two types of remittance orders are different. If the remitter wants to purchase an airmail remittance order, they should explain to the post office when purchasing it and request a remittance order form printed with the red characters "飞滙" (airmail remittance), fill it out according to the instructions, and pay an additional airmail fee of 1.5 jiao per order in addition to the ordinary remittance fee. The post office will then fill out a remittance order stamped with a rectangular red "飞汇" (airmail remittance) stamp and enclose it in an airmail letter for delivery. The stub will be sent by the post office by airmail. If you only purchase an ordinary remittance order, even if the remitter encloses it in an airmail letter, the stub from the post office will be sent by ordinary mail, and it will naturally not arrive at the same time.</p>
<h3>First Day of Public Screening of "Secret Code"</h3>
<p>Four Sold-Out Shows, Praised by Chinese and Foreign Audiences</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the public screening of "Secret Code," produced by the Central Film Studio, at the Grand Theater in the city. Because of the film's long-standing reputation among the public, everyone was eager to be the first to see it. Moreover, yesterday was a holiday, and although the weather was not good, all four shows were extremely crowded. Every show was sold out before the screening began. Many foreigners also came to see it. The second and fourth shows were especially crowded. The belief that the film gives to the public can be seen from this. Before the screening of the film, there were three other excellent short films worth introducing: ㊀ "China News" No. 48, which contained the latest news in the country, such as Chairman Chiang's personal tribute to General Zhu Peide, the German warship "Emden" visiting the capital, the Qiantang River Railway Bridge project, and Kong Xiangxi's special trip to England to attend the coronation of the British King; ㊁ a cartoon of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and Chairman Chiang's mottos; and ㊂ the grand occasion of the International Eucharistic Congress recently held in Manila. All of these were newly obtained news materials from various places by the Central Film Studio News Department, and they were warmly welcomed by Chinese and foreign audiences.</p>
<h3>Madame Fan Passed Away Last Night</h3>
<p>Madame Hu Shuyuan, the wife of Mr. Fan Guang, a counselor of the Ministry of Finance, had been suffering from a back ailment. She had repeatedly consulted famous Chinese and Western doctors for treatment. However, her condition worsened in recent days, and her whole body became swollen. The doctors were unable to help her, and she passed away at 子時 (11pm-1am) on the 18th. The 大云 (funeral service) will be held at her residence at No. 529 West Avenue on the 19th at 酉時 (5pm-7pm).</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>▲A Passenger Vomited Blood and Died. At 1:00 AM yesterday morning, a rickshaw with license plate No. 5530, driven by Wang Jiahua, a 1-year-old from Taixing, who lived at No. 88 Nancang Street in the South City, was traveling north on Rue du Consulat when a passenger, about 40 years old, wearing a duckbill cap, a black cloth padded jacket, cotton pants, black shoes, and gray socks, resembling a vendor, suddenly vomited fresh blood near Xietu Road and was unable to speak. The rickshaw puller notified the police, who urgently summoned the ambulance from the West District Fire Brigade to take him to Hunan Hospital. He had already died when he reached the hospital.</p>
<h3>Appeal Investigation into the Use of Elderly People to Transport Counterfeit Money</h3>
<p>Han Yan耕 and Others Disagree; Judge Wu Rules for Postponement</p>
<p>The French Police Station received a tip-off in January this year that private traffickers of counterfeit banknotes were using poor elderly people to transport the goods. The delivery location was at No. 4 in Fuxing Lane, East Zilaihuo Street, and so on. Inspector Jiang Futian led the detectives on duty to wait at the address. They saw Wang Zengjin (65 years old, from Shaoxing) and Zhao Yixian (56 years old, from Ningbo) coming along, wearing ragged clothes. They went forward to inspect them and found 98 counterfeit one-yuan banknotes of the Central Bank, two counterfeit five-jiao banknotes, and 400 counterfeit two-jiao banknotes of the Chinese Farmers Bank. They were arrested and confessed that their boss was Han Yan耕 (44 years old, from Shaoxing, living at No. 60 Yuelai Lane, Caishi Road). The detectives then arrested Han. Han confessed that the sales agency was at Xie A Mao's house at No. 22 Kangyi Lane, Kangti Road. The detectives then went to arrest Xie, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. Only his mistress Han Wangshi (i.e., Wang Xiuzhen, from Suzhou) and Liu Wangxuan were arrested. Rubber sticks, flower plates, and other items used for printing banknotes were found in the pavilion. They were all sent to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution. At the end of the trial, Wang Zengjin and Zhao Yixian were each sentenced to two years in prison and deprived of their civil rights for two years. Han Yan耕 was sentenced to three years in prison and deprived of his civil rights for three years. Liu Yuxuan and Xie Wu were each sentenced to one year and six months in prison and deprived of their civil rights for two years. Han Yan耕 and others disagreed with the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. The other day, Judge Wu Tingqi, accompanied by Judges Chen and Wang, presided over Criminal Court III to interrogate and investigate the facts and reasons for the appeal. They ruled that they would wait for a later date to re-examine. The appellants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Forging Business Cards</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>Not long ago, there was a "fool" who stole someone else's things, but turned himself in to the police station, demanding to be sued. Later, the judge sentenced him to fifty days, but frowned and thought the sentence was too light. To the average person, this news is truly a bit "ridiculous," but to that "fool" himself, it was a major matter of solving the three major problems of life: food, clothing, and shelter!</p>
<p>People are willing to be sued and lose their freedom for the three major problems of food, clothing, and shelter. It seems that the French precept "Liberty or death!" has lost its sacred value when it comes to China (in fact, it can be said that this is the case all over the world now). Is this because people voluntarily give up freedom? Isn't it still to solve the three major problems of life: food, clothing, and shelter!</p>
<p>In order to solve these three major problems of life, countless people in the world have committed "crimes" and received terrible "punishments"!</p>
<p>"Young Wu Zhenmin, having been unemployed for a long time, suddenly had a whimsical idea and forged Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's business card. He went to the Municipal Government to seek an audience with Yu Hongjun the other morning, intending to trick him into a position." Wu's courage in forging Chairman Chiang's business card cannot be said to be small. Moreover, he wrote in ink on the business card: "Acting Mayor Yu, please arrange a position in the Municipal Police Bureau for the bearer." This kind of "fraudulent deception, hoping for illegal gains" is an unforgivable crime! However, after all, it was because he had been "unemployed for a long time" that he "whimsically" forged Chairman Chiang's business card to seek a position in order to secure his livelihood. Although his behavior is shameful and despicable, his situation is truly sad and pitiable.</p>
<h3>Medicine</h3>
<p>— Luo Quan</p>
<p>The wind whistled, tightly beating the rain's dots and lines against the glass window, against the scrap metal in front of the house, sounding ancient and dark tinkling.</p>
<p>I was watching a quivering, almost broken spider silk in such a violent storm.</p>
<p>What overwhelmed my partner was not only the heavy illness but also the accumulated fatigue of the large pile of days that had passed. Therefore, what would cure him was not just medicine, but also some days of rest. This was clearly impossible for my partner.</p>
<p>I remember a gloomy dusk when he staggered back, holding his head in both hands. Then he collapsed on the bedding without a word, shouting about a headache, shouting about thirst, and shouting about blood... Then the phlegm he spat on the floor shockingly had a streak of scarlet.</p>
<p>When I went over to help him up, I realized that the veins on the back of his hands were swollen like earthworms, completely devoid of color, and his body was trembling as if cold. A terrifying shadow invaded our hearts, making us feel empty and looking at each other in fear.</p>
<p>He was overwhelmed by the heavy illness, and the accumulated fatigue of many years made him even weaker, making his breathing even more ethereal, like a quivering, almost broken spider silk stretched across a rainstorm.</p>
<p>Because I unintentionally placed a few playful coins in front of a fortune-telling stall during the day, I heard that his illness was like a handful of sugar scattered in water, which would slowly dissolve on its own. When I came back, I couldn't help but secretly look at him as he slept, his face ashen, piled with unbearable pain, his chest rising and falling feebly under the covers. I knew that the rising and falling was uneven and tired.</p>
<p>Could the strongly heightened stupor keep out his pain? Could the daily coarse food stem his scarlet blood streaks?</p>
<p>I can't wait idly, I can't!</p>
<p>The words of consolation bought with those few coins were not enough to reassure me. I thought that the fragile lifeline might be broken by a gust of wind and rain. I could not and could not bear to watch him struggling in pain.</p>
<p>So I squeezed into a large crowd of worried people.</p>
<p>I jostled with other anxious people, and was jostled and pushed by the people in front and behind. I couldn't take care of the old and weak, couldn't take care of the women carrying their sick. I felt like I was going to a tense life-and-death arena to help a dying man. I was impatient, for the sake of begging for a good medicine for my partner.</p>
<p>I began to explain his condition to the person in the small window. I said that he was in pain now, rolling in bed, shouting about headaches, shouting about thirst, and that he coughed up blood after coughing. This was all I knew.</p>
<p>But his condition was indeed not just these. He was yelled at, he was driven away. He tore his own flesh, eating his own blood and sweat, he lived like a cow or a horse. Now he was overwhelmed by illness and fatigue, and I came for him.</p>
<p>I wanted to beg for some medicine.</p>
<p>The man asked me what disease he had. This was exactly what I wanted to ask him, and I was going to ask everyone.</p>
<p>But what could I say? I had to beg for something, and I had to lower my head, feeling ashamed. Like the others, they felt happy and infinitely comforted.</p>
<p>But I finally got angry. I wanted to ask the reason for his illness. I not only wanted to beg for some medicine for him, but I should also get back all that had been taken away from him. I used a roaring tone, yes, it was useless to use a friendly tone to get back what had been taken away.</p>
<p>I was impatient, I was angry, and I quarreled with the man in the small window for no reason. I madly hammered at the small iron window, wanting to grab the heads of that man and everyone else, drag them to the ground, and tear off their hair. I shouted, waving my arms, I jumped, my fists landing on the bodies of the people around me.</p>
<p>A rude man ran over and gave me a heavy punch, and we fell to the ground, unable to struggle any more. I propped up my upper body with my right hand, glaring at that wild animal with hostile eyes.</p>
<p>Can some medicine cure my partner's illness? No. His vitality had been deprived for a long time. Some medicine would be in vain for his illness. I thought.</p>
<h3>Gunfire</h3>
<p>— Luo Yu</p>
<p>On my fifth day in Tianjin, braving the wind mixed with yellow sand from the north that raced through the streets, I moved to the N school dormitory in the southwest of the city. While busy sorting through my luggage, I took a moment to look at the long north-south street, wondering if it had already been lost to my memory. At the southern end of the street, behind the empty earthen embankment, the wind ran back and forth wildly, chasing after itself. The sandstorm also blurred the nearby buildings.</p>
<p>Were there very few pedestrians? Even rubber-wheeled carts hid in recessed corners of the walls: Only a unique sound occasionally drifted from the south.</p>
<p>Boo-boo-boo…</p>
<p>Some students, wearing goggles or Japanese-style masks, hurriedly crossed the street. As they ran, they chatted and laughed with each other, entering the doorway of a photography studio. Everything looked new, familiar, and indifferent, except for the yellow sand mixed in the wind, which sometimes got into people's eyes and made them tear up for no reason, and the sound mixed in the wind, which drifted over more frequently and urgently,</p>
<p>Boo-boo-boo-boo…</p>
<p>From then on, whether I was in the dormitory, in the cafeteria, or walking around the campus watching the goldfish in the pond, I always heard that monotonous yet assertive sound, circling in my ears.</p>
<p>One Sunday evening before school started, only I and a fourteen or fifteen-year-old classmate were in the room. While the other five or six children had all run into the concession to see a movie, we were all writing letters. The courtyard was very quiet. However, my heart was always filled with unease, confusion, and doubt, and I always seemed to hear the piercing gunshots constantly mixed in the wind.</p>
<p>I timidly asked the child if he also "heard that peculiar sound." He smiled at me, wrinkled his nose, and said disdainfully:</p>
<p>—It's the Japanese soldiers doing target practice! You'll get used to it eventually.</p>
<p>This revelation was a very effective help to me, turning me from confusion and doubt to concrete imagination.</p>
<p>After that, every three to five days, I could hear the same gunfire again. Sometimes, in the middle of a dream during a peaceful gray dawn, hearing the crisp and closely connected continuous strikes, it would be like imagining some bean-green, short and lively soldiers moving in the field, stepping over people's crops, crossing some water ditches in the vegetable gardens, placing the slaughtering machinery on the ridges of the fields, and starting to play out their roles towards the morning light, towards the small village in the sound of crowing roosters.</p>
<p>Boo-boo-boo-boo… Boo-boo-boo-boo…</p>
<p>Sometimes, on a foggy morning, I would hear the heavy and muffled gunfire, and I would even lose track of the direction from which it was drifting. I could only imagine the cold, dead angel of the aluminum fields, passing through and back through a misty fog bank indiscriminately.</p>
<p>Although it was a sound I had grown accustomed to, it eventually made it impossible for me to remain calm. My imagination produced needles, and those needles pricked my nerves very subtly, so a newly arrived and amplified confusion and doubt took over me again.</p>
<p>One evening, I strolled towards the racecourse road in the suburbs, walking while grasping the elusive gunfire that seemed like black bats. I saw cars driving from the end of the avenue, from the racecourse, towards the city. Those gamblers, sitting in rubber-wheeled carts, wore faces painted with gray dirt, making them look like comical or pitiful clowns. I walked a long way until the sun had slowly set. The gunfire stopped.</p>
<p>Not long after, a large car came running from the front, carrying bean-green soldiers, rushing towards the city. I saw the slaughtering machinery erected on the roof of the car pointed directly at my chest, directly at my eyes. I guessed that the death angel's water-cold arrows were also aimed at my heart, grinning menacingly.</p>
<p>A whirlwind left me with a chill. The whip of survival sobered me up.</p>
<h3>The Cherry Blossoms Have Fallen</h3>
<p>— Lu Ping</p>
<p>The cherry blossoms have fallen…</p>
<p>A kind of terror, like a millstone, presses on my heart. For three whole years, I have almost been crushed to the point of losing the freedom to even take a breath. As a result, my mood has changed drastically. In the past, I loved spring and autumn because spring was like a beautiful young woman, and her bright and lively posture aroused my love very much. Autumn was like a brave and heroic warrior, and his majestic and unyielding spirit filled me with boundless admiration. But now, I am not only afraid to see autumn, but I simply can't even develop a good feeling for spring. I hate this snobbish spring light. It gives people gentleness and sweetness, but in the blink of an eye, it makes people suffer its cruel exploitation, like a disloyal woman. At first, she makes people love her, but soon she finally makes people suffer her deception, and she herself goes away triumphantly. Everything in autumn is dead. As soon as autumn arrives, half of nature dies. At this time, the millstone of fear in my heart also presses especially hard. Once a person passes middle age, it is as if autumn has arrived in the year. Autumn is a symbol of middle-aged people about to grow old and elderly people about to die! Although I have just stepped into the edge of middle age, seeing this symbol will arouse the sorrow of life being as fleeting as morning dew.</p>
<p>This time, returning to my hometown, it happened to be the season when the cherry blossoms were withering, so I didn't see the cherry blossoms. However, although I didn't see the cherry blossoms, the aftertaste that the cherry blossoms give me will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>I love the cherry blossoms. Mother always said that it was because I sympathize with the brevity of the cherry blossoms' life, just like my own happiness. So when I see the cherry blossoms, I will immediately recall my childhood. But the past is just like a dream, and this dream has gone so far away that it is somewhat vague when I think about it. Even if I could see other children singing and laughing under the cherry blossom trees, it would still arouse a little joy in me, but this joy would be covered with a thin layer of sadness in an instant.</p>
<p>Now it is the season when the cherry blossoms are withering again, and the spring light will also quietly pass away, and unintentionally, I happened to run back to my hometown from a distant land at this time. So, under the cherry blossom trees, I relived the old dream of childhood. Although I did not see the delicate and pure white cherry blossoms in full bloom, when a gust of wind blew, I only saw countless petals of withered flowers dancing in the air, floating on the grass path, floating on my body, like fallen leaves in the autumn wind. I couldn't help but sigh, "The cherry blossoms have withered again! Why didn't I come back sooner?"</p>
<p>Now, I have quietly left my hometown again and embarked on this journey of life.</p>
