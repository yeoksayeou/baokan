<h3>日貴族院質問對華外交策略</h3>
<p>勝田指摘廣田外交拙劣　英國政策奏功大可效法　佐藤今日向衆院闡明方針</p>
<p>［東京］日外相佐藤尚武將於明日在衆議院答復民政黨議員鶴見祐輔及政友會議員蘆田均所提之質問、屆時藤將闡明日本之外交政策、（中央社十日路透電）</p>
<p>［東京］日貴族院預算委員會今晨舉行會議時、勝田主計於質問國內問題後、轉至外交問題、首責首相於答復衆議院質問時、曾迭用“多元外交”之名稱、彼覺多元外交“名稱甚不適宜、勝田繼謂、林首相所闡明之經濟外交、確為二十年前日本之外交、彼時雖屬經濟性質、惟從未有此種名稱、日本對華外交主要者為經濟外交、但惜乎從未能顯示其效果耳、英國對華外交、自始至終均偽經濟外交、數十年來未嘗稍變、故能成功、日本在華雖有橫濱正金銀行之設立、但其業務純為外國匯兌、不若匯豐銀行之具有投資力、余覺吾人將來有開設此類銀行之必要、政府認為如何、勝田次復提出質問曰、自岡田內閣以來、廣田卽標榜對華外交三原則、其精神誠正確、惟行施之法殊覺拙劣、故廣田外交終歸失敗云、外相佐藤尚武聲稱、渠不擬完全變更以前各外相之方針、惟僅將變更梁認為不適合之點云、勝田乃曰、如是則前閣之外交方針、何者適合、何者不適合、佐藤答曰、關於經濟外交及在華設立類似匯豐銀行之銀行等事、均與大藏省有關、故將與大藏省充分進行協商、至余在貴族院大會所述各節、不過為政策之綱領、與此後之心境耳、又關於具體問題、如何者應予繼續、何者應加變更、則余尚未决定、且此種問題不能由外務省單獨定奪、不久卽將與有關各省舉行協商云、（中央社十日電）</p>
<p>［東京］貴族院預算總會於十日午前十時十二分開會、岩倉道俱男對對於議事程序首先發言、略謂、審議期間不足、政府應作何見解等語、當時因林首相缺席、乃由兒玉遞相代答略謂、若於不得已時、自當充分考慮云其次由研究會之勝田主計氏起稱、國體明徴當為國民全體充分了解者、為何故意列入政綱第一絛、而使外人發生誤會、余認為應深自謹愼、又近閱衆議院之答辯中、有所謂多元外交及二元外交等等語句、查我國外交本屬一元、並非多元、而此種語調、認為足以使外人對於我國外交抱其不信之念、故一國之首相、在發言上應請極其愼重、何况在政綱上公然揭山、實屬不合、當請說明其理由、至於現內閣、擄謂以經濟外交為主、但自二十年前迄今、均以經濟外交為主矣、故其後將經濟外交之語、僅稱外交（而今日再稱經濟外交、固無不妥、維徒有其言、當無效果、查英國之對華政策、皆為經濟外交、且於三十年來獲得成功者也、若行使經濟外交、則應行照英國之匯豐銀行、當有設立之必要、政府對此作何見解、至於對華外交、溯白岡田內閣以來、設有所謂三大原則、日前佐藤外相在貴族院大會演說、摘出前內閣外交方針中之優點、謂意在照之實行、但究以何者為優點、又不知其劣點為何、應請答解、</p>
<p>佐藤外相答、對於經濟外交、認為彷照英國之匯豐銀行、我國亦有必要、此項尊見極關重要、且屬於財政事項、自應與大藏當局充分協議、至於昨在貴族院所述各節、不過為政策之大綱而已、具體上究應踏襲任何政策、此事尚未抱有充分意見、最近當與關係各大臣盡量協議也、</p>
<p>結城藏相答、對華外交上迄今所有之金融機關、各有其職分、其活動情形不能認為充分、今後務使之得以充分活動、自應與關係當局充分協議、</p>
<p>勝田氏又稱、就任以來為日尚淺之外相、所言固是、但事實急辦、尚請從速講求對策、並望研究國內情勢、愼重辦理為盼、現內閣之所謂庶政一新、究竟出鬼出蛇、莫知底蘊之事其名、應請詳細說明、其次、關於預算之不安情形、認為伸張國力之人物、尚嫌不足、現內閣應樹一定之理論、依其理論而設定稅制、然後研究根本辦法、此項主張卽為世上不安之原因、應請將預算前途、加以明白之解釋、零時半休息、午後一時半繼續開會、林首相說明日本建國之理想後答解如左、所謂外交二元化之語言、余愼重希望之、至於二元化等類語句、則為極力避免者也、所謂庶政一新之語、認為內容空虚而使民心不安、給與注意、但政綱上無論對內對外、均經留意、全國進展國運、安定民心、力主穩健排除急激、以欲實行政第者也、</p>
<p>勝田氏復謂、由預算而調整物價、政府有何見解、對於國際借貸、寄運現欵、大致所需欵額若干、現欵在世界之地位、須愼重考慮、蓋世界各國爭相保留現欵、目的在國防故也、現內閣處理此事、操之過急、實為寒心、至改正日本銀行條例、與低利政策、均請表示大致見解等語、</p>
<p>結城藏相一一解釋後、由大藏公望男爵關於樹立政綱提出質問、林首相答以同感、又對於庶政一新與新設諮詢國策機關、亦由林首相答以正在考慮等語、午後三時五十五分散會、（十日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日本四相保持聯絡</h3>
<p>俾確定具體策</p>
<p>［東京］佐藤外相現認為有確立新外交方針之必要、其第一步擬於議會閉幕後、卽須提議設立關係各大臣問之會議、其範圍與前內閣同、陸海外三省會議或成為常設機關、或應其必耍、隨時要求干係大臣參加協議、究以何老為宜、雖未抱有决定之意見、而林內閣之對華政策、則以民間接觸之經濟觀啻為主旨、且與財政當局擁有緊密關係、又如結城藏相會在東京商工會議會長任內時、特別對於中日經濟外交、具有獨自之見解、因此加入結城藏相、大致將以陸海外大藏四相會議為中心、設立四省事務當局會議、以便開始外交方策之再檢討云、（十日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日外部發言人答記者問</h3>

<h3>經濟提携之意義</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>邇來國際間之經濟事態。可注意者。除歐洲方面。法國廢止統制外匯仍採自由主義政策。日內瓦國聯原料會議討論原料分配問題等兩事以外。在東亞方面。則日本經濟政策近復十分活躍。日議會對於日“偽”經濟制度之樹立。既有明確之展示。面兒玉等經濟使節且將於明日啟程來華。日本在華商工會議所又準備在滬舉行聯席會議。聞其二十六件提案中。十一件為要求交涉減低關稅。凡此種種經濟上之活動。皆直接間接以中國為其對象者也。</p>
<p>我國既已成為日本經濟發展之對象。不能不深察日本之經濟目的若何。此項材料。隨處可得。。最近日代表在國聯原料會議卽有坦白之陳述。其言曰。“使原料品輸入日本獲得便利。尚不足以解除當前之困難。此必同時探取各項措置。使工業製造品之國際貿易。獲得便利而後可。”觀此數語。則日本之意。實在一箭雙雕。寗非彰彰明甚。然在各國限制進口制度未廢止前。日本究將以何術打破現狀。進謀解决日貨之出路。原料之徵集乎。此一問題之解答。吾人觀於日商相最近對議員之答復詞。可知一斑。滿洲出產原料。日本</p>
<p>以其原料而加工。當屬最良之辦法……現想上當以日滿經濟集團打成一片。……實際上滿洲之產茶計晝及其資金。均由日本一手造成者。若如此滿洲竟受中國之威脅。實為吾國（日本商業之奇恥大辱……”日本經濟發展之根本企圖如此。則所謂經濟提携。其性質常可想見。卽置此而不論。僅就當前事實。一加考察。亦不難明瞭此一新名詞之含義。津青紡織業近年來陸續歸入日人掌握。現在日商擁有中國紡椗總數三百萬椗以上。上海紗市非惟不能如往日之獨立。且時受青島紗市之牽掣。恐不久以後。不特華北為然。卽全國紡織業亦將全受其操縱。年來油豆餅市面之受制於大連特產市塲。非顯例歟。再如華北走私。盡人皆知為特殊勢力造成之局面。而非關稅政策招致之結果。但彼方仍有交涉减稅之說。彼方雖稱正規商人不欲同流合污。又不甘受損失。乃有此項請求。要知冀東狀況未能復原以前。卽使增稅。亦可能杜絕走私。况减稅乃中國原有工商業之致命的打擊乎。</p>
<p>要之。人之謀我者周。其有計劃有步驟。固理所當然。吾人惟有力求所謂平等互利者。能名實相符而已。</p>

<h3>國際貿易協會發起日大使館紙織中國旅行協會</h3>
<p>以引致外人來華遊歷為宗旨　邀各部會長及各界領袖發起</p>
<p>中國國際貿易協會、為引致各國人士來華遊歷、藉以增進吾國旅行事業之收入、抵補入超、並傳播吾國文化、促進國際認識起見、特仿照歐美各國及日本已有辦法、發起組織中國旅行協會、昨曾函請各部會長暨本市市長吳鐵城、各界領袖虞冶卿王曉籟•徐新六•林康候•杜月笙•張嘯林•等為發起人待協會組織成立後、擬聯合中國旅行社各交通機關公司商號、在國外宣傳我國名勝、在國內設法改善旅行設備、便利國內遊歷、</p>
<p>其宣言云　比年以來、中國外受世界經濟恐慌之波動內遭天災人禍之摧殘、白銀外流、金融枯窘、都市既陷於困窮、農村復瀕於破產國際收支之平衡、屢年逆差、而對於貿易上之入超問題、亦日形嚴重、全國上下、殆無不欲急速自拔於經濟恐慌之深淵、故努力作各方面之調整、政府曾實行貨幣金點之改造、及推進中央地方之建設、人民亦兢兢業業、急圖生產事業之發展、以謀各項商品之自給、封外輸出之增加與夫貿易入超之彌補、此固良堪欣幸、惟綜觀各方之努力、對於國際收支平衡逆差之抵補、類皆偏於增加有形貿易一方面、對於無形輸出、則尚未能切實注意、至於</p>
<p>無形輸出　中之旅行事業、則尤為各方所漠視、夫招引外人來本國遊歷、自不僅可使外人在本國消費其日用之資、多購買本國之物產、因而增加全體本國國民之收入、亦且可使外人對於本國之文化及民情、得有更深切之認識一切誤會與淺見、得以消除、國際間之友誼因而增進、其為益至巨、以故近世各國、無不以旅行事業為國家最重要之企業、盡力提倡、瑞士本以</p>
<p>旅行事業　為立國之經濟基礎、倡導最力、法德美意等國亦急起直追、美洲之加拿大古巴墨西哥美國、曾未遑多讀、東方之日本印度及越南復迎頭趕上、倡導不遺餘力、歷審各國倡導之方法、殊不外政府與人民共同努力、各有捐輸將鐵道輪船旅館各業聯合一致、力謀適富之改進、並作普遍之宣傳及周詳之指導、語其結果、則來遊之人、扶老携幼、爭前恐後成千累萬、而各國由此種事業之牧入、類皆</p>
<p>以百億計　不特足以抵償國際收支平衡之逆差、亦且可以繁榮全體國民之經濟、但試問其提倡所耗之費用、則尚未值由提倡而得之利益之絲毫、我國土地廣漢、物產豐富、勝蹟佳景、隨地皆是北平之宮宇、杭州之湖山、固久已膾炙人口、曲阜之聖境、長安之古蹟青島之海濱廬山之面目、亦向為中外所稱道、至於桂林之山水、昆明之氣候、峨嵋佛林雁蕩之瀑布、則已漸受外人之注意、而上海之繁華、廣州之富麗、復早在外人心目之中、他若悠久之文化、及純樸之民意、尤值得外人之研討與認識故環顧全國、殆無地不足使外人</p>
<p>留連忘返亦　無物不足使外人出資購備、準是而論、則我國由旅行事業一項所得之收入、似應極巨、然一老歷年國際收支平衡之估計、則可知其為數甚微與西洋各國固無從比較、卽對東方之印度與日本、亦有遜色、推原厥故、實為我國政府與人民、尚未能積極提倡之所致、考旅行事業發達之要件、除優美之天然環境外、當為交通設備之便利、旅館佈置之舒適、僕役侍奉之慇懃、國產物價之劃一、與夫國外官傳之普遍及指導之團體、其在我國、則凡此諸端、苟非尚有待於改良、卽係</p>
<p>全需創造　然若無一中心之組織、作精詳之計劃、為統一之指揮、則無論改良與創造、均屬着手無從曠觀先進各國之政府與人民、殆無不有此種組織、如日本之旅行事業局、瑞士之國家旅行社、德國之旅行事業促進社意大利之國家旅行部、雖名稱各異、而性質則同、同人等內怵於經濟恐慌之深刻、及我國旅行事業之落後、外感於各國提倡旅行事業之成效、爰有旅行協會之組識、冀圖將全國有關缺行事業之各種機構、及對於旅行事業有特殊興趣之中外人士、</p>
<p>聯合一致　共同努力於國內之設備改良、及國外之宣傳指遵等等、而期來遊我國之仕女、無倫在任何方面、皆感便利與舒適、進而希望來遊之人、日益增多俾國民得巨大之收入、國情得正確之了解、中外之感情因以日臻融洽、而我國家之國際地位、及經濟情形、亦得由之增高與改善、至本會組織完成之後、對於國人在國內及赴國外之旅行、亦擬就力之所及、</p>
<p>加以倡導　蓋目前我國之多數國民尚缺乏高尚之娛樂、其偶有閒暇、則大都為不正富之消遣、其結果不僅無益亦且有害、欲圖糾正此種錯誤、提倡旅行、實為最善之一途、蓋旅行始足使國民於工作忙碌之餘、變換一新環境增進新精神與新力量再以從事所業、且若使國民常在國內旅行、則鄉村之居民、可洞悉城市之繁華、城市之居民、可深解鄉村之樸質、於考察邊彊重鎮、遊覽名勝古蹟之時、藉以明悉我國歷史之悠久、文化之深邃、及建設之偉大、因而益增其</p>
<p>愛戀祖國　之熱情、在參觀各種工商組織、政治學術及社會機關之際、亦可認識我國各方面之實情、因而增進其所必需之常識、此於國民本身及國家前途、為益殊未可勝言、至若使國人往外旅行、則他山之石、可以攻錯、我國家方在近代化之過程中進行、其所欲取法於先進各國者正多、國人在國外如有心得、於返國之後、自足以改進所業、而國家亦實受其益、要之、旅行事業之提倡、在今日之中國、實為必要、無論外人來華旅行、國人赴外國放行、或國人在國內旅行、於我國皆有百利而無一害、同人等深信此種工作之極有價值、用敢聯名發起、努力從事、期有所成、謹此宣言、望邦人君子、共起圖之、</p>

<h3>國際籃球二次决賽中華隊壓倒美國</h3>
<p>45：32　周達雲時來運來獨獲二十分　全隊活躍防禦森嚴敵勢收歛</p>
<p>俄國再勝日本得乙組冠軍</p>
<p>中華籃球隊昨晚以極敏捷活潑之姿態、以四十五比三十二壓服美國隊、於是本屆國際籃球高級組錦標、不得不於本星期六晚第三次决賽解决矣、查第一戰中華雖曾以三十四比四四敗北、而昨晚自始即取激進政策、聲勢雄壯、除上半時一度以十四比十六落後外、後此則一路引領前導、浩浩蕩蕩、使美國陷於苦戰周達雲之打法、雖有礙於全隊之合作、然昨晚時來運來、有投必中、獨得二十分、反爲中華獲勝之第一功人、以償其第一次賽之過失、如是以觀中華隊成敗、將繫於周子一人歟、另一獲勝原因、則由於五人均能克盡厥職、嚴密監視其對像、長人如洛克萊茵、均無所用極、卡遜亦鮮有深入籃下機會、比較言之、當以馮念華最爲出色、乙組之戰、俄國再勝日本、二十八比十七、錦標遂歸俄國所得、中美戰績如下、</p>
<p>先發制人　日俄戰畢、中美繼之登塲、中華由馮·尹·鄺·蔡·王五人上塲、美國京登缺席、由勃利時·洛克·萊茵·派洛斯·及卡遜五人作戰、開賽後、中華先發制人、猛撲敵壘、鋭氣殊盛、馮念華先行登記、蔡演雄罰勃利時加上一分、繼之蔡在籃下奪球衝出、直達對方籃下、一舉又告成功、以五比零盛極一時、馮念華等鑽營活躍、王蔡防禦森嚴、敵勢歛跡、五分鐘時、因鄺耀雅之犯規、始由勃利時爲美國打開紀錄、</p>
<p>緊張時期　鄺耀稚登記二分後、洛克忽演故技、籃下兩中、成七比五、蔡演雄百歩穿揚、落克卡遜努力搏戰、造成九九平手、中華暫停、由陳宗祺入替蔡演雄、以對付洛克、果見效果、馮念華王南珍又加三分、中華原居前茅、萊茵雖還敬一只、鄺耀稚又增一球、萊茵罰中後、中華由周達雲上場、調下鄺耀稚、洛克隻手向背後抛中一球、突以十五比十四超出中華、卡遜藉罰球又增一分、局勢乃愈加嚴重、幸各人加緊防衛、力堵敵勢、馮念華先造十六平手、周達成繼之以十八比十六、爲中華爭得二分之勢先權、終了上半時、</p>
<p>全盛時代　再戰聲起、中華由韓振元入替尹貴仁、餘爲馮·周·陳·王、美國一仍其舊、萊茵直衝籃下、在界外擲中一球、裁判未見、乃造十八比十八、王南珍突破重圍、運球如神、立即敬中、周陳馮三顧茅廬、以二十五比十八高枕衾席、聲勢顯赫、美國叫停、派洛斯出、調以福斯透、斯時中華方興未艾、美國長脚失去效用、卡遜雖勇、防禦不暇、遑論進攻、而周達雲忽然時來運來、得球即射、射而必中、霎時間連獲五球之多、以三十五比十八壓倒美國、氣勢之盛、不可一世、從此中華高枕無憂矣、</p>
<p>一路順風　一通百通、中華斯時竟無往不利、中鋒跳球、亦屢爲馮陳等攫得、更使對方缺少投籃機會、有之、亦屢以操之過急、失去標的、而周達雲時運未衰、又續獲五分、以四十比廿三前導、相差十七分之多、成爲最大之差數、嗣後鄺耀稚調周出塲稍息、待四十三比二十七馮念華四次犯規時、乃再度進場、斯時中華勝利在握、大又馬將、美國隊心餘力拙、不得不甘拜下風矣、最後結果爲四十五比三十二、</p>
<p>俄勝日本　七時起、日俄先行開火、俄隊憑其體格上之便利、頗爲順手、加以鴻運高照、投籃凖確、竟以十七比四佔先上半時、休息後、日本力圖報復、雖以十二比十一領前一分、總結果仍以十七比二十八歸俄國獲勝、成績如下、</p>

<p>有機化學、向初視爲一種繁頥複雜之科學、數十年來各國學者所提出之學説及規律不一而足、但均祇能説明極小一部份之事實、此外極多反應、均被視爲越規、而無從加以解釋、浙江大學化學系主任周厚復氏、近年來對於有機理論、研究不遺餘力、曾於去年發明一新電子學説、在中國化學會會誌、德國中央化學雜誌登載、該論文指陳數十年來各家學説之誤謬、並將所有有機化學全部之事實、均包羅賅括、往昔所視爲無可理喻之無數軌外之反應、至此均得一極簡單一元化之滿意解釋、使一部繁劇瑣碎之有機化學、變爲一極易理解便於記憶之學科、與無機化學中之電離學説、同其功效、周氏學説之主要點、在於不承認每個原素在週期表中佔一固定之位置、而謂其實際上因電子位置之移動、各原素之性質可隨之而變、例如炭有時可等於硼、有時可等於㲷或氧、㲷有時可等於氧、有時可等於硼或炭之類是、故週期表實爲一連續之函數、而不爲各個單獨之原素所佔據、若即謂週期表爲無量數不同性質之原素所連接而成、亦無不可、此種厚之移位、恒視其所連接之原子而定、且悉遵照一簡單不變之規則、去年周氏在中國化學會誌上所發表之論文、曾分寄歐美有機及物理化學當代之權威、如德之韓慈費許·夫而非·革爾樂法央司、法之布雷司·諾馬、美之羅克斯等人、均有覆函稱譽、例如電子移動説之創立者及近世有物理論化學之最高權威英國應果德氏來函中有云、「當余以濃厚興趣讀完君之論文時、有不禁使余情緒上感受震驚者、即君説致用之廣與理解之透澈也、余希望君學説之流傳、將使今而後世界上對於有機化學反應及構造問題益深刻其興趣、余可斷言、君所討論之大部、必立即爲歐洲及美洲大多數國家所承認也、」周氏近復推廣其學説、並加整理、著爲一書、凡七萬餘言、名爲「有機反應之新電子學説、」旁徵博引、歷舉數十年來有機化學中疑難未决之問題數百則、一一加以極簡單顯明之解説、並用也克司光·赤內光·陰極·綫分柝·有機基之分解電位差、及偶極矩等物理方法測量之結果、證明其學説之精確、在書末並將歷來各家關於有機反應學説、加以簡明之叙述、以爲比較、該書已出版、聞現由上海聯營書社代爲分寄分售、預料周氏學説流行後、將使整個化學中發生一大革命、而在化學史上亦佔重要之一頁云、</p>

<p>侵犯主權蔑視行政　不懂教育不諳環境、無理干涉、侵犯我主權蔑視我行政、日益加甚、必使我學校當軸、不勝其煩、不能照辦、顧全主權、不願照辦、自動放棄補助權利而後已、夫監督華人學校、社會局自有職權、何勞工部局代謀、且得有補助費之各校、其設備情形、補助開始以前、早得工部局認爲滿意、今設備情形仍舊、學生數量仍舊、吹毛求疵、被扣補助費及有問題之學校、竟達十之七八、壓廹臻於極點、禮讓無可再言、獨立之國、自由之民、豈可妄自菲薄、任人支配宰割耶、奮鬥求生存、同胞們盍起而與之爭、誓爭平等待愚、要求增加華人教育經費、並反對此次無理吹求、立即取銷限期改造通知、倘不能達到目的、則補助費乃我華人納税後應享之權利、爲國家主權計、爲租界同胞教育計、爲納税人權利計、糾合區內全體同胞採有效手段、以相周旋、而我私校同人尤宜整齊歩驟、鞏固陣容以待後命云、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>三品紗突降</p>
<p>紗市愈覺不支</p>
<p>近期套賣不絶</p>
<p>檯面異常鬆懈</p>
<p>紗市趨勢、跌風稍起、良　連朝狂漲之大阪三品紗、昨則突然回挫下、降矣、且打破二百六十元關口、於是人心受其影響、同時昔日之多頭、在近月依然抛賣、壓力殊重、至於現紗銷塲、亦屬平常、惟北路辦胃尚佳、即美棉狀况、仍在穩定中、對於遠期購進看好、市態益昂、</p>
<p>標紗跌一元三四角</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因美棉復趨上升、本月市氣較緊、漲六角、但拍至遠期轉趨下落、因價高後、錦昌在近月套賣不絶、人心怠懈、檯面轉鬆、同時三品紗來電近跌遠漲、市况愈挫、二盤開拍、本月忽跌一元四角、遠月尚能支持、三收盤仍屬平庸、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均跌八·九角至一元、午後開盤以三品紗下跌、人氣尤弱、買者缺乏、市價緩歩下游、二三盤稍見回上、迨至收盤、三品紗再見下落、比上日價近失五元八角外、遠跌三元四角、賣勢忽强、標紗結果各月比上午收盤價均跌三四五角、查賣出大豐一千○五十包、賡豐二千七百五十包、大昌成三千四百包、潤康二千五百五十包、福康　千四百包、恒益一千六百包、裕康九百包、義成六百包、大昶五百五十包、愼記五百包、買進錦昌七百包、裕大二千一百五十包、昶記一千二百包、泰昌二千八百包、信誠一千八百包、森康二千包、仁豐一千包、恒昌九百包、振大六百包、</p>
<p>紗銷推津帮爲最健</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚佳、但比上日爲少、津帮辦胃最健、所貨昨亦有六百包開去、連其他各帮買去統計一千三百八十五包、售價平平、買額列下、</p>
<p>預料美棉將回</p>
<p>標花昨先下落</p>
<p>棉市下落、氣勢甚疲、因上海存棉充盈、廠方儲藏、足敷二三個月之需用、外棉雖蒸蒸日上、而空方膽氣仍壯、午後以紗市回挫、三品棉花下墜、逆料今日之美棉、恐有反動回跌之勢、</p>
<p>遠月跌四角爲最鉅</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、美棉雖告回漲十六至二十四磅音、然印度棉跌二羅比半至三羅比、市塲人心和平、買氣澹泊、蓋以上海存棉充足、紗市回軟、棉市更帶疲乏、標花結果各月比上日收盤價均跌五分至　角、午後開盤因三品花市回小、市盤更挫、且多數心理預料今日美棉、有反動回跌之象、市情尤軟、結果各月比上午收盤價再跌五分至一·　角、查賣出達記一千三百擔、大豐一千一百擔、澄記一千五百擔、合興二千二百擔、益昶五千七百擔、潤康三千八百擔、益康三千二百擔、新昶一千一百擔、大昶二千四百擔、福康一千三百擔、買進錦昌一千一百擔、昌記二千五百擔、大豐一千四百擔、泰昌五千擔、元一千一八百擔、永大三千五百擔、長和五千三百擔、瑞源一千二百擔、聚興一千一百擔、達記一千擔、大昶一千一百擔、同和一千一百擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>現棉消費日廠較旺</p>
<p>現棉華商採辦不暢、而日商廠對於靈寳細絨採辦不絶、來源全無云、</p>
<p>抵空與了結均有</p>
<p>美棉仍漲二十餘磅音</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况參差、各月由跌二磅音至漲六磅音、旋投機家從事買進、市價逐歩上升、現棉脚地有力、現貨商及同業購買不已、同時、布銷暢旺、空户紛紛抵補、市勢益趨堅挺、其後多頭獲利了結、稍見回軟、收盤時、依然堅定、計現貨漲二十二磅音、期貨漲十九至二十五磅音、英棉現貨跌七點、期貨跌一至三點、印棉初因多頭了結而跌、後因出口商買進而回、其後、多頭了結及期貨商售出之額、爲逢跌買進者所吸收、計平果爾跌二·五至二·七五羅比、奥姆辣跌二·五羅比、白羅溪跌二·五至三羅比、原電錄左、（九日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十日開盤預測、白羅溪爲二百三十九羅比、奥姆辣爲二百二十二羅比七五、均漲四·五羅比、平果爾爲一百九十羅比半、漲四·二五羅比、</p>
<p>三品期紗反動回跌</p>
<p>期棉上落仍少</p>
<p>十日大阪電、現紗漲三至五元、十六支扇面二百五十元、漲四元、二十支金魚二百六十八元、漲三元、四十支五星四百○五元、四十二支雉子三百九十九元、均漲五元、三品期紗跌三元四角至五元八角、近月爲二百五十四元一角、遠月爲二百五十八元五角、期棉跌二角五分至漲三角、近月爲七十八元九角五分、遠月爲八十二元三角、</p>
<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>拆息日長公債大户紛紛出籠</p>
<p>市價下跌四五六角</p>
<p>公債市况經長時期之盤旋後、昨漸有開朗之勢、大户多頭、均漸出籠、空户仍有大批實貨流出、同時拆息亦緊、昨市開至一角二分、套利漸遠、公債賣氣愈濃、按本月期存賬籌碼、尚在二千萬之數、空方陣容、均操諸於實力雄厚之大户、故前途趨勢、恐將續有虚軟下降之可能也、昨日上午開盤、趨勢尚趨沉悶、散户頗有購進、三十五·四十三號等則賣出頗湧、戊丁種本月好上五分、丙甲等均下降五分至二角、次盤五·三十五號等仍賣出不少、十號頗多買進、市價續跌五分至二角、下午開盤、進出漸見繁盛、市况依然不振、四十三·三十二號抛賣益勁、五號亦多出籠、戊種起再小五分至三角半、收盤趨勢仍見萎靡、四十三號每檔續有不少售出、五·三十五號等仍在抛賣、市價復小五分至三角半、全日結果一律下跌二角半至六角、成交總數、計四百七十一萬五千元、兹將其漲跌高低比較、列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>麵粉實銷停頓</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈先漲後跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好二三角、坎拿大好三四角、利物浦好一便士、故開價時、人心頗覺振奮、較前日收價、計漲一分左右、惟過此之後、反漸回跌、近期則實銷停頓、業外多頭、祗好隨市出檔、四月份亦有多頭、同趨疲弱、七八月份、究屬新粉、出户一多、遂亦轉平、迄至下午開盤近期如三四月份、實銷仍少動静、多頭則微有了結、較上午又落一分、七八月份、因新空加碼、亦落一分零、現目下情形、如去化不暢、近期市面、尚看續疲云、</p>
<p>日粉運銷來滬</p>
<p>爲量雖微…日後可慮</p>
<p>半年以來、日貨大量進口、每週恒在萬噸之譜、據航業界言、竟已恢復一二八前之景象、故日商個個喜形於色、至於進口之日貨、向以砂糖·人造絲·鋼鐵·鉛絲·以及化學品·鏹水等爲最多、迭誌前報、但昨進口之日輪三笠丸儎貨三千一百四十餘噸、內砂糖鋼板之外、並有麵粉一千包、蓋自粉麥價格高漲以來、足以引誘洋粉之輸入、在平津一帶、日粉占有特殊地位、本有起代本國粉之勢、上海則粉廠林立、向係供給各地、而今竟有日粉輸入、機製麵粉業不知作何感想與應付、</p>
<p>來價所跌更鉅</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、各月份市面、呈疲滯不振之象、洋麥雖報漲二三四角及一便士不等、惟以最近之粉銷而言、北方雖幾處已經開河、但交易反見岑寂、大部分原因、實爲本粉市值太高之故、日粉乘機推銷、麥市既無粉銷帶動、遂不得不趨鬆軟、故本月份反逐跌七分、遠期亦少生色、迨至下午開盤、本月份因粉市難振、人心又軟、最低曾至六角二分、較前日計跌一角三分之巨、四月份亦帶落五分、六月份以下新麥、出入不多、尚見平静、至本月份之暴落、半屬多頭心虚回出、半則聞有新籌碼加入、是以一蹶不振也、現麥市面、因粉銷無起色、標凖又跌、故各檔又喊低二三分、開山東麥六元六角半、天台麥六元六角一二分、淮安麥六元六角三分、計開一千餘包云、</p>
<p>油豆餅午後忽回小</p>
<p>昨標凖油豆餅市、午前開市承前日之漲風、且連電繼續報漲、油豆餅各市一律堅挺、惟昨日現豆廠化已减、祇有客帮略辦、油餅消化亦平、而大連電訊亦有回跌之傳説、行空立即套出、多頭亦紛求了結、午後各盤隨市歩趨而下、收市標油跌二角至三角半、標豆小四五分、標餅小二分半至一分半、</p>
<p>河米銷塲無起色</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源較稀、共祗二十餘號、貨約四千七八百石、乃本街銷塲既滯、包胃亦淡計天津帮辦薄稻七八包、及西安帮辦厚粳七八百包、故市况依然疲軟、結果厚粳行情又跌五分至一角、薄稻繼貶角許、形勢似尚難以看好耳、杜洋尖帶軟幾分、陰元無市、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地來船無多、約七八號、因天時乍陰乍雨、店方上市無幾、市上各貨交易愈見淸淡、白粳價疲軟、薄稻高價免定、中次薄稻及早稻疲勢、白元及各秈依然懈淡、其餘各米、稍帶軟勢、</p>
<p>（客秈）昨到頭仍旺、存積亦厚、上午本客進胃均淡、祗本街略有應酬、客帮泉州粤帮各辦數百包、半日間只成交三四千包、價乃立小五六分、午後粤化復活、在市暢辦糙米五千包、　米千餘包、本街亦有續辦、市價急轉向上、回好五六七分不等、貨主貶價求售之舉亦懈、形勢復轉站立全日開出江西米八千多包、湘米二千多包、漢糙一千包、</p>
<h3>金融</h3>
<p>標金起伏有限</p>
<p>金市昨初以海外銀市下降滙兑回長、倫敦生金跌半便士、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位縮三厘、標凖標金價降爲一一五九元一角、晨開平盤、開後略形疲軟、但起仆有限、市態呆滯、今將半天市况誌後、</p>
<p>晨開爲一一五六元、與前收同價、春源永元茂永生源永脱手、退至五元八角、恒昌永同豐裕納條、升至五元九角、入後多空均有限盤、滙豐掛牌英美俱平、以及平衡税下降二分二五、均乏變化、午收仍爲一一五五元九角、半天間祇有二角起仆、結果微挫一角、</p>
<p>結價以中央標準金價退爲一一五九元一角、照收盤價言約撳三元餘、現貨市况平定、天津貨照加十四元、烚赤買價十一元、均未對做、賣價照加十五元、由銀樓帮做七十兩、大豐恒售予銀樓帮五十兩、同價、</p>
<p>塲內交易有限、綜計同豐餘恒昌永大豐恒等略進、春源永生源永元茂永略售、半天成交祗二十八條、本月份條子、尚剩五百六十條、內多空各三家、</p>

<h3>所得税申報表類之編製法（七）</h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>（三）商號收受存款報告表</p>
<p>現行所得税之第三類，爲證劵存欵所得。依所得税暫行條例第二十七條之規定，存欵利息之所得税，應由付息機關之業務負責人代爲扣繳。所謂付息機關者，除銀行錢莊等金融機關外，爲收受存欵之商號。本表即此種商號用以報告其收受存欵之事情，以備主管徵收機關之稽考者也。至於將來扣繳存欵利息所得税時，則另有第三類證劵存欵所得額報告表。查收受存欵，依照現行之商法，本限於銀行錢莊等金融機關。商號收受存欵，原非法律之所許。惟事實上商號之收受存欵者，比比皆是。如第三類存欵利息所得税祗徵諸正式之金融機關，則金融機關之存欵，將逃避於商號，反有失政府監督金融機關以保護存户之本意。故現行關於所得税之法律，特根據事實，對於各商號之收受存欵者，與金融機關同樣課税。其税率，最近亦如金融機關之自千分之五十，减至千分之四十。本表稱商號收受存欵報告表，此商號二字，應依照商人通例第四章之規定，從廣義解釋。凡所得税暫行條例施行細則第四十六條所稱之公司，商號，行棧，工廠，及營利之個人，其收受存欵者，均應塡此報告表。兹説明本表之編製方法於次：</p>
<p>（一）商號名稱，地址，業别，電話，依照所得税暫行條例施行細則第八十五條及第四十六條之規定，凡公司，商號，行棧，工廠，及營利之個人，應將其商號，住址，營業種類等，分别塡入公司報告表及行號報告表。本表應塡之商號名稱，地址，業别，蓋應與此等報告表中應塡者相同。至於電話之塡報，亦無非爲徵收機關接洽之便利起見，並無多大之意義也。</p>
<p>（二）存欵種類　存欵之種類，以普通商號所收受者而言，當不外定期存欵，活期存欵，同人儲金等數種。至於儲蓄存欵，則除儲蓄銀行，及兼營儲蓄之銀行外，不得收受，依所得税暫行條例第一條之規定，第三類所得税即證劵存欵利息所得之課税，所謂存欵者，當作存入欵解釋。惟據財政部之解釋，普通商店及個人間之變相存欵貸欵，如係以生息爲目的者，其所得之利息，亦應課程，又據第三類證劵存欵所得征收須知草案第三條之規定、銀錢業外商號團體及個人借與公司商號之欵項，其利息亦應課税。則借入欵之不來自銀行錢莊者，無論其帳簿，係記作存入欵，抑借入欵，均應塡入本表，其存欵種類中，當加入定期借入欵及活期借入欵等種曪。普通商號從銀行錢莊所來之借欵或往來，逢行莊向其結算利息時，應全部照付，不得代其扣繳利息所得税，故此種借入欵或往來，無須塡入本表。</p>
<p>（三）存户總數　存欵種類本表所塡報之存欵，爲各種存欵人之户數總計及金額總計，無須逐户塡報其户名及金額。例如定期存欵三户，存欵總額三萬六千元是。此項户數及存欵總額，應以塡報日之現在情形爲凖。其存欵之金額，無論變動如何迅速，祗須記入其塡報日之總數，將來發生增减時，無須爲變更之報告。</p>
<p>（四）負責人姓名及塡報年月日　塡報年有日者，記入塡報本表之年月日也。負責人姓名，依所得税暫行條例施行細則第二十七條之規定，第三類所得税之扣繳，由付息機關之業務負責人，代爲扣繳。本表所塡之負責人姓名，當係負有扣繳責任之業務負責人。而所謂業務負責人者，即公司，商號，行棧，工廠等之董事長，經理人，或廠主，號主等是也。考現行所得税制度，對於第一類所得即營利事業之所得，其課税以採用申報法爲原則，對於第二類所得即薪給報酬所得，及第三類所得，即證劵存欵所得，課税以採用課源法爲原則，課源法之所得税，應由支付機關代爲扣繳。依所得税暫行條例第十八條至第二十條及施行細則第三十五條之規定，扣繳之負責人，將來對於税欵如不依期限報告，或怠於報告，或隱匿不報，或爲虚僞之報告，或不依限繳納税欵者，須受罰則之制裁。而扣繳之額有不足時，應負賠償之責。（未完）</p>

<h3>鴻門宴</h3>
<p>— 鍾寶</p>
<p>楚項羽是一個志大才大的大人物，但可惜他的量太小，和他的才志不相稱：所以他雖能成大名，終竟身敗名裂。他的手下本來有許多賢才，可是慢慢的都跑到漢高祖那裹去了，因為項羽捨不得給人高官大爵來酬勞，和好勝，不肯承認有人的才能會高過他的。既不得實惠，又不得尊重，當然護也不甘心為他用了。漢高祖適得其反，他志小（他只想子女玉帛，無心做皇帝。他後來有此心，是人教他的），才小，但他的量大，能容人，能用人，捨得給人好處。夫下之士都樂為用，因此他能無敵於天下。項羽所學的是“萬人敵”，所以他是一個良將，高祖所能為的是信義與寬容，所以他是一個大領袖。由他兩人看來，可知失敗成功不是偶然的。“鴻門宴是高祖生命裹一個最大的難關。他之所以能打破這個雖關，全靠他平日能得士。有了事來，赴湯蹈火都有人替他苦幹，他怎能不成功呢？</p>
<p>秦二世無道，羣雄紛紛起來革命。楚項羽的叔父梁，為着便於號召，立了楚懷王的孫阿心做楚王，大家都尊他做共主（其實是一個傀儡）。那時秦兵還很強，誰也怕和他正面開仗。懷王覺得當前最要緊的事，是滅素，因此到了點將出發時，他和諸將約道：</p>
<p>“誰先入關中誰便王關中。”</p>
<p>諸將面面相覷，各有難色。漢高祖因為今天起床太早，精神不足，在班裹不斷的打呵欠，並沒有留心懷王說什麼。不想懷王偏偏看上了他，有心呌他去，不斷的看了他幾眼。這可把站在高祖身後的張良急壤了，他不知要用什麼方法把高祖提醒好。他使勁的抓了幾下頭皮，想出法子來了。他重重的踩着高祖的鞋後跟，低聲說：</p>
<p>“您就說，您去。”</p>
<p>“我去！”高祖果然這樣對懷王說，其實究竟去那，他還是莫名其妙的，不過他相信張良的計謀不會有錯的。</p>
<p>“我也願和沛公（高祖曾被衆人擁立做沛縣宰，常時的人都呌他做沛公）同去。”項羽志在全天下，區區一個秦國，他是看不起的。他現在爭着要去，他是恨秦打破了他叔父的軍隊，他要親自去報復。</p>
<p>“這可不成！這可不成！”懷王的老將生怕懷王答應了項羽，忙氣急急的攔着說。這裹又不是什麼的正式朝庭，許多禮節都可以不用顧及，大家儘可以隨便的說話。“項羽這個人，又兇悍，又殘忍，又輕挑。他也曾攻破襄城，襄城人都給他活活的埋死，沒有一個剩。他無論經過什麼地方，沒有不大屠殺的。不如另派一個仁厚的人仗義西去，告諭秦父兄，以德服人，不以力取。秦父兄受他們的主人，磨折了許久。如果眞的派一個仁原的人去，不虐待他們，一定可以破秦的。項羽兇悍，不要派他。只有沛公素來寬大，是個長者，夠資格去。”</p>
<p>懷王果然單派高祖西略秦，不許項羽去。可是項羽不是這樣容易控制的。他不聽懷王的話，回頭把一位上將軍殺了，自己做上將軍，帶着諸侯軍，從另一條道攻秦。那時秦攻鉅鹿，項羽親自帶兵來教。他看出諸侯軍都是沒用的東西，不靠他們。獨自帶楚軍渡漳水。過了河，他把船都弄沈了，把燒飯吃的鍋都打破了，把士兵居住的房屋都燒了，只保留夠吃三天的糧餉。然後對士兵說道：</p>
<p>“人家都說我們楚人只會打敗仗的。不打個勝仗，怎能雪恥？我以為一個人忍辱而生，還不如雪恥而死。我是誓寧死不辱的，楚國健兒，你們也該有這樣的志氣。你們看罷，我們只有三天的糧餉，什麼後路都絕了。你們要生存就得拼命殺敵，前路才是你們的生路。”</p>
<p>項羽說時，轉着他那一雙發亮的圓眼，威嚴而又銳利的眼光射在每一個士兵的身上，他們像中電一般似的，馬上起了大反朧，都興奮起來，勇氣百倍。他們和秦軍打了九次大仗，斷絕了秦軍的知道，殺死了秦軍幾個大將。秦軍一敗塗地，不可收拾。</p>
<p>此時諸侯軍來救鉅鹿的，有許多人，這裹那裹築了十幾個營駐紮着，但他們都怕秦兵，不敢出頭。等到楚兵和秦兵交戰，諸侯軍的將領都爬上營牆上來看，他們看見楚戰士無不一以當十，人變了血人，馬變了血馬，還是在打着。有時看到眼花了，只見一道一道的紅光，簡直分不出什麼人啊，馬啊，刀啊。楚兵呼聲動天，幾乎把他們的耳膜都震破了。他們嚇縮做一團，牙關不斷的打顫，一切都像不由自主了。最後楚軍的勝利消息把他們驚醒了。項羽召他們去，他們眞佩服到五體投地，將入轅門，跪走進去，沒有人敢仰起頭來看看項羽，於是項羽眞眞實實的做諸侯上將軍了。</p>
<p>項羽浩浩蕩蕩的帶着大軍入秦。他人難英武，舉世無雙，但可惜只靠一人之力，究竟有限，結果趕不上手下有許多謀士勇士的漢高祖。高祖竟先入關了，並且更前進得遠，連咸陽也攻破，整個秦國也得到上手了。這可把項羽氣壤了，他暴跳起來，把自己心愛的畫戟也打斷了，大罵道：</p>
<p>“𢋷癩蝦蟆想吃天鵝肉！你劉邦（漢高祖姓劉名邦）什麼身分？一個泗水亭長，一個無賴漢，敢和我項羽爭天下嗎？你想做秦王？好，讓我先烹了你！”</p>
<p>項羽毫不講理，便用武力打入關來。</p>
<p>這一邊的漢高祖，還是“一頭霧水不知天”。他看見咸陽宮的富麗，趙女衛姬的嬌媚，歡喜到眉開眼笑，全身癱瘓了。他笑笑地對他的左右說道：</p>
<p>“讓我就住在這裹罷。”</p>
<p>有人去報告給樊噲張良知逍，他們忙跑來勸諫道：</p>
<p>“主公今日如有所貪，失衆人心，大事去了！”</p>
<p>高祖給他們提醒，馬上覺悟起來，橫着心，頭也不掉便離開咸陽宮去了。他呌人把秦國的重寶財物都藏在府庫裹，婦女都讓她們出宮自由擇配去。他保全自己一個清白的身子，乾乾凈凈的回到霸上的軍營裹來。士卒和百姓看見高祖這樣高潔，人人感佩自勉。高祖又聽張良的話，召集諸縣父老豪傑宣告道：</p>
<p>“父老受秦苛法之苦，已經許久了！誹謗的滅族，兩人談話問絞。我也曾和諸侯相約，誰先入關誰做關中王。今兒我先入，當然是我做你們的國王。什麼苦民的苛法，我也不要，我只和父老約法三章：殺人的死，打傷人的和偷盜的，按所犯輕重抵罪。用人照舊，不更動。我之所以來，是替父老除害，不是有所侵略殘暴，不要害怕！我現在回到霸上軍營來，不過是等待諸侯來定約束罷了。”</p>
<p>高祖派人和秦國的官吏到處去佈告，秦人都非常歡喜，爭着送牛羊酒食來慰勞漢軍，生怕高祖不做秦王。</p>
<p>項羽來到戲西。高祖才知道。高祖以為，卽使項羽來，也不能無故背約的，因此他完全不以為意。高祖左司馬曹無傷是一個小人，他聽見項羽生氣，要打高祖，他相信高祖敵不過項羽的，想先為自己留一個地位，因此甘作漢奸使人悄悄地告訴項羽道：</p>
<p>“您快來處置沛公罷！他想王關中，已經使子嬰（新投降高祖的秦王）做宰相，秦宮裹的珍寶他都全要了。”</p>
<p>“明天給士兵吃飽，去打破沛公軍！項羽聽了來人的話，很生氣，馬上下令攻高祖。</p>
<p>“沛公住在山東那時，貪財貨，好美姬。今兒他入關，財物無所取，婦女無所幸，可以見得他志不在小。他才是你的敵手，快打他，不要錯過了機會！”項羽的參謀范增，查得高祖的事情很清楚，乘機勸項羽趁早下手。</p>
<p>（范增也是一個才大量小的人，他不知道一個人量小便不能成器，他以為一個人的失敗，大抵是被人所算，殺盡勝己者，自己便是天下第一人了。他不曉得“一雞死，一雞鳴”，天下的賢能是殺不盡的。量小的人，整天眼紅人，謀害人，心勞力絀，反促自己更快的滅亡呢。）</p>
<p>楚左尹項伯是項羽的叔父，素來和張良要好，忙乘夜跑入漢軍，找着張良慌慌張張的說道：</p>
<p>“老弟，快走罷！明天項王派大兵來打沛公，到時玉石俱焚，你也不會生了！老弟前途遠大不能自作無益的犧牲，快跟我走罷！”</p>
<p>“沛公待我非常的好。今兒他有急難，我便逃走去了，非義士應為的事，我一定要把這個消息告訴他。”</p>
<p>張良不等項伯應許，便跑進高祖帳裹來儘情告訴他。</p>
<p>“怎麼辦呢？怎麼辦呢？”高祖從床上驚跳起來，連問着。</p>
<p>“誰替大五定激怒項王之計？”</p>
<p>“　生。他說如果我守着關，不讓諸侯兵進來，我可以王整個秦地呢。故此我聽了他的話。”高祖很懊悔的說。</p>
<p>“大王您自己想想，您的軍隊打得過項王嗎？”</p>
<p>“當然打不過。”高祖很失望的答道。</p>
<p>“那末，怎能和人計較呢？請您就去見項伯，說沛公不敢背項王如何”？</p>
<p>“你怎能認識項伯？”</p>
<p>“這事遠在秦亡以前。</p>
<p>他和臣交游，他殺了人，定了死罪，我救了他，所以今兒事急，他來告訴臣。”</p>
<p>“你們誰大誰小？”</p>
<p>“他比臣年紀大”。</p>
<p>“請君替我請來，我也得以兄事他。”</p>
<p>張良出來請項伯。項伯難碍情面，只得入見高祖。高祖大排筵席欵待項伯，舉着酒杯替他祝壽，和他約為婚姻。高祖先使他說服了，才說出正文：</p>
<p>“聽聞有人在將軍面前說我壞話，其實我那裹有什麼對將軍不起。我入關來，一點也無所貪，籍吏民，封府庫來等待將軍。我之所以遺將守關，是防備盜賊與其他意外。我日夜望將軍來，怎敢作反呢？望伯把臣之不敢背德，盡情和將軍說說！”</p>
<p>“不用掛心，我可以代您說話，但您明兒千萬要早一點來對項王謝罪才好！”項伯這老實人，就信了高祖的話，露出憐憫的眼光來安慰他。</p>
<p>“當然，我一定早去。”高祖裝着很敬謹的答着。</p>
<p>項伯不敢躭擱，乘夜回去，把實情告訴項羽，並且勸他道：</p>
<p>“沛公不先破關中，公怎敢進來呢？打有大功的人，不義，不如因而善待他罷。”</p>
<p>項羽答應了。</p>
<p>那時高高祖軍隊在霸上，只有十萬；項羽的軍隊在新豐鴻門，有四十萬。如果他們眞的交戰起來，高祖當然敵不過項羽。</p>
<p>第二天，高祖帶着一百騎到鴻門來見項羽。項羽看見高祖眞個親來謝罪，心裹也就釋然了。（量小的人，最要緊是要人肯下他。一讓了他，他認為自己勝利了，心滿意足，也就無意怪人防人了。）高祖把昨晚從張良那裹學好的話對項羽說道：</p>
<p>“臣和將軍戮力攻秦，將軍戰河北，臣戰河南。出乎意外，臣先入關破秦，得到在這裹復見將軍。今兒有小人離間，使將軍疑臣。臣素愛鐵將軍，不願因臣不肖，重傷將軍的心，所以特地親來請罪。”</p>
<p>“這都是您左司馬曹無傷說的，不然，籍（羽名）何至懷疑您？”</p>
<p>項羽卽日宴請沛公。項羽項伯東向坐，范增南向坐，沛公北向坐，張良西向陪坐。范增本想就在席上結果了高祖這一條命，飲酒的時候，他送了項羽幾次眼色，又拿自己所佩的玉玦，舉了三次，暗示項羽馬上决意，下命斬高祖。項羽自心裹想道：“沛公這可憐蟲，還能幹什麼，殺之不武，讓他去罷。”因此他默然不理范增。范增看見項羽不肯下手，只得自己出來找着項羽的堂弟項莊，對他說道：</p>
<p>“君王為人不忍，眞誤事！這事！索性就讓我們幹罷。你進去祝壽，祝壽完，就在席間殺了沛公，否則我們終有一天會給他俘虜了。”</p>
<p>項莊入來祝壽，祝壽完，對項羽請求道：</p>
<p>“君王宴飲沛公，軍中無以為樂，請讓我舞劍！”</p>
<p>“好。”項羽不知項莊的用意，以為他眞想欵待客人，也就答應了。</p>
<p>項莊㧞劍起舞，劍尖常常對着高祖，想找機會行刺。項伯看見不像樣，生怕項莊鬧出事，也起來舞劍，常常拿自己的身子遮蔽着高祖。情形非常緊張，張良忙跑出軍門來找樊噲入衛。</p>
<p>“今日事情怎樣？”樊噲看見張良，發急着問。</p>
<p>“緊急極了！今兒項莊在席前舞劍，他的意常常在於沛公。”</p>
<p>“那末，他就是想殺沛公了！讓我進去和他拚命。”</p>
<p>樊噲立卽帶劍擁后進來。軍門拿戟的衛士，攔着不讓他進。他側着盾把衛士撞倒了，脫身跑進來，靠着帷向西站着，很生氣的睜着一雙發紅的圓眼瞪着項羽，氣忿忿很像想吞吃了他。項羽嚇了一驚，忙起來跪着（古人席地而坐，跪着是想提高身子，準備有本便於起來）接着劍問道：</p>
<p>“這個客人想怎呢？”</p>
<p>“他是沛公的參乘樊噲。”張良答。</p>
<p>此時因為有新客進來，舞劍暫時停止，但沛公已經哧到完全失了主意了。</p>
<p>“是個壯士，賜他喝一大杯。”項羽這樣吩咐着。</p>
<p>樊噲拜謝後起來，把酒喝了。</p>
<p>“賜他一肩猪。”項羽又吩咐着。</p>
<p>他們給樊噲一個生猪肩。樊噲把盾覆在地上，把猪肩擱在盾上，㧞劍切來吃。</p>
<p>“壯士還能喝嗎？”項羽問。</p>
<p>“臣死還不避，一杯酒辭什麼？”樊噲已經沒法再忍了，乘機把要說的話都一齊說山來：“—秦王有虎狼之心，盡力殘殺無辜，因此天下都背叛他。懷王和諸侯約，誰先破秦入咸陽便做秦王。今兒沛公先破秦，入咸陽，一點也不敢有所貪，封閉宮室，同霸上駐軍，來等待大王。所以遣將守關的，是防備別的盜賊和意外之事。他勞苦功高如此，還未有對侯之賞，而大王竟聽小人的話，要誅有功之人。這正是亡秦之續，臣竊為大王不取呢。</p>
<p>他理直氣壯，說得項羽答不出來。項羽只得改容，以禮貌待他，請他跟張良坐在一塊。坐了一會，高祖要起來解手，張良和樊噲都跟着出來。此時還未終席，項羽派都尉陳平來請高祖。高祖又想出走，又想回頭，不知怎樣才好，問張良樊噲道：</p>
<p>“我想走啦，但出來未曾告辭，怎麼辦呢？”</p>
<p>“大行不顧細謹，大禮不辭小讓。如今人為刀爼，我為魚肉，還辭什麼？”</p>
<p>樊噲要高祖馬上走避，高祖乃留張良替他謝罪。</p>
<p>“大王來時，帶了什麼禮物？”張良問。</p>
<p>“我帶了一雙白璧來，想獻給項王：一雙玉斗，想獻給亞父、是范增，項王尊他做亞父）。他們一直有氣，我不敢獻，現在請您替我獻罷！”高祖這樣吩咐張良。</p>
<p>“好，讓我獻去。”</p>
<p>項羽的軍營和高祖的，距離有四十里遠。高祖决定不坐車，騎馬，帶樊噲，夏侯嬰，靳彊，紀信，四個人拿着劍盾步行跟隨，從酈山下，芷陽間道走。臨走時，高祖對張良說道：</p>
<p>“從這條路到我們軍營，不過二十里。您猜我已經到了，才好入見項王。”</p>
<p>高祖去了許久，張良猜想已經到了軍營，才入謝道：“沛公多喝幾杯，受不了，醉到不能親自拜辭，謹使臣良奉白璧一雙，再拜戲大王足下：玉斗一雙，再拜奉大將軍足下。”</p>
<p>“沛公現在那裹？項羽問。</p>
<p>“沛公聽問大王有意督責地，他害怕，獨自脫身去了，想現在已到了軍裹。”</p>
<p>項羽不說什麼，取了那白壁，隨手放在座位上。范增受了玉斗，氣忿忿掉有地上，㧞劍撞碎了牠們，嘆道：</p>
<p>“唉！䜿子不足與謀，奪項王天下的，一定是沛公。我們今兒都被他俘虜了。</p>
<p>高祖一回到軍裹來，便把曾無傷殺了。過了幾天，項羽引兵往西屠咸陽，殺秦降王子嬰，放火燒阿房宮，一直燒了三個月，火還不減。項羽把寶賃，婦女滿載着往東走，刦回老家去。有人說項王道：</p>
<p>“關內由河險阻可做屏障，東有函谷關，南有武關，西有散關，北有蕭關可以拒敵，同時地肥民富，可以發展。在這裹建國都立國，實在是霸王之業呢。”</p>
<p>項羽不聽，因為他看見秦宮室都已經殘破不能住，並且他又非常的思念鄉土。他說：</p>
<p>“富貴不回故鄉來，像穿着錦繡衣裳，在夜裹遊行，誰看見呢？”</p>
<p>說項羽那個人同來嘆道：“人說楚人是洗乾凈頭戴帽的猴子，千眞萬眞！”</p>
<p>有入把這句話傳給項羽知道，項羽生氣，烹死了那說他的人。</p>
<p>范增認項羽不可與有為，告辭回鄉。他氣到幾乎走也走不動，走到半道，背上生疽而死。</p>
<p>（目前項羽雖然一時之盛，結果他－味孤行，敵不過多人幫忙的高祖）</p>

<h3>談談本國地圖</h3>
<p>— 陳天澤</p>
<p>地理是研究人類生活與自然環境間相互的關係，而研究地理最重要所必備的工具，便是地圖。世界各先進的國家，對於地圖的編繪，無不力求精明詳密，而其編繪之色彩分劃，從前以政區為分界，現在進而以色彩為表示地形學之等高綫色層，而由地形之高低，探求其水系，山脈，以及氣候，人口，民放，言語，農產，礦產，交通，商埠等等的情狀，這確地圖編繪上一大進步，也就研究地理學者得到一種較有進益的工具。</p>
<p>我國近年來對於地圖之編繪事業，較往年為盛而且也較多進步者。例如除了商務印書館中華書局開明書店世界書局箏書局所發行者外，而有“世界輿地學社”“東方與地學社”“上海與地學社”等專事研究編繪地圖的學社，統計其出版關於本國的地圖，包括：掛圖，各省分圖，地方明細地圖，以及人口密度圖，疆域變遷圖，交通圖，農林畜產分布圖，等，亦不過數十種，都是供普通實用，與夫小學中學地理科之工具用書，較之歐美日本各國，共印刷編繪等項，雖遠不能及，然而其隨地圖進步之趨勢，漸能採用等高綫色層之地形圖，可謂合於科學的方法。</p>
<p>現代所需要之本國之地圖，固然其編繪要求上列之標準，而吾國人所希望當有注意者，約列數點如下：（未完）</p>
<h3>集團設診</h3>
<p>— 大德</p>
<p>“集團結婚”已經舉行不少的回數，因為這能節省許多的物力，而得行堂皇的婚禮，並能由市長親自證婚，所以社會稱便，每屆參加的很是踴躍。</p>
<p>醫病和結婚，同樣是人生的大事，但有些人生了疾病，找不到適宜的醫生。或者一個人生了幾種病，要東西奔走着去治療，激樣豈不是糜費了許多物力。所以有人理想把上海的名醫聚於一堂，集團設診，使病家再沒有找尋的困難，也沒有東西奔走的浪費。現在這種理想居然實現了，這就是五洲大藥房，特請專家設計，在總店大厦內裝置完備的診室，舉凡內外各科，都由海上第一流的名醫主診。五洲總店大樓，就在四馬路中，交通非常便捷，而且診室一部，附設收方處，診病以後，藥方隨即配好，就可帶回服用。像這樣週到的服務，病家當然稱便，要踴躍的參加了。</p>

<h3>親善的眞實憑據</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>日佐藤外相，在貴族院演說外交方針時，我國新任外交部長王寵惠氏，亦在南京發表對日方針，惟王部長之聲明，此較佐藤外相更為抽象，更為簡單，然外交官之發表意見，而是初次發表意見，只能說外交方針的輪廓，决不能為詳細的具體的說明，此固外交官之立場應如此也。</p>
<p>林銑十郎前在議會所發表的演說，及佐藤尚武就外相後所發表之談話，當為日本一種重要的立場，與對外之姿勢，佐藤在貴族院宣佈同樣態度後，王外長卽發表談話，相隔僅數小時，王氏措詞，雖極抽象，但在兩國外交的姿態上，業已發現新途徑，及意見相符之點，則以後兩國，當本親善互惠的精神，進行具體的談判，此固無可懷疑者也。</p>
<p>但是所謂親善，所謂平等，所謂互惠，并非空言可塞責，應有事實為之根據，現在要看日方之眞親善和假親善，眞正互惠和口頭互惠，誠意平等與貌為平等，當先看華北問題，倘日方果有誠心，果有眞意，應該撤銷冀東非驢非馬的偽組織，取消冀察侵害國權的政委會，取消侵害中國領土權之所謂中日“滿”三國接壤之特殊地帶，若果能如此，方足以見日方眞正親善之精神，否則發表的言語，雖屬好聽，我看都是廢話。</p>
<p>但日外相佐藤尚武，在貴族院所發表之演說，决非貿然，其演詞的大意，必獲得首相林銑十郎，陸相山元，及海相米內光政的同意，大河內之質問，亦似係事前商妥，以予佐藤發表該演詞之機會，據此以觀，則佐藤尚武的演詞，必有相當的價值，决不是僅僅能說幾句好聽的話，以博取聽衆的滿意與贊賞，而拋棄事實於不顧，或事實與言論竟絕端相反，便算了事，蓋以外相的地位與發表的演詞，為世界所共聞，更應有相當的價值也。</p>
<p>現在日外相佐藤尚武的宏論，我輩已欣聞之矣，現在且看所謂中日經濟提携的手法如何？華北方面的態度如何？我輩當熱切地渴望地拭日以觀。</p>
<p>歷史故事</p>
<h3>漁夫的死</h3>
<p>— 陳汝惠</p>
<p>那漁夫打着槳唱道：</p>
<p>“太陽已下山了，</p>
<p>誰知我心中憂傷；</p>
<p>月亮也起來了，</p>
<p>為什麼還不渡江？”</p>
<p>伍子胥聽到這歌聲，知道追兵已去遠了，就帶着太子勝鑽出蘆葦，走到江邊去，漁夫的船，果然已經悄悄地靠在那裹。他抱起太子跳進船裹，漁夫把槳一擺，撥刺刺一陣水聲，船就向江心淌去了。</p>
<p>白茫茫的一片江水，對岸只隱在烟霧裹；這船就像浮葉一樣的從江而上划過去，漁夫的鬚髮都花白了，但是打起槳來，還像一個強壯的漢子。日夜驚慌的伍子胥，這時候才把心安定下來，三個人都不曾說話，他倆獃獃地看着漁夫打槳，漁夫也只管着自己的槳的起落。</p>
<p>不消倆個鐘頭就渡過了江，這已經是吳國的地界了。伍子胥背着太子先上岸，漁夫縛好船也跟了上來。沒等伍子胥拜謝，就說：</p>
<p>“將軍好像餓了，待我去取些飮食。”</p>
<p>伍子胥望着忽忽走去的漁夫的背影，不覺疑惑起來，“他這樣慌慌忙忙的跑去，或者是報告了誰來捉我吧？可是偽什麼要渡我過江呢？——我且躲一躲吧。”他就拉着太子，又藏到蘆葦裹去了。</p>
<p>不一會漁夫提着飯籃來了，江岸上却沒有了他倆，他想：“只有一刻工夫，决不會跑遠的；一定躲在那裹了？”又向四處一望，只見密密叢叢的蘆葦，在風裹搖擺着。“大概就在這裹吧，讓我喚他出來＂漁夫就唱道：</p>
<p>“蘆中人，</p>
<p>蘆中人，</p>
<p>就是落難的窮士嗎？</p>
<p>為什麼避着我不見！”</p>
<p>伍子胥聽見呌喚，又向外偷偷地張望，知道只有漁夫一個人，就帶着太子走出來；從漁夫手裹接遇飯菜，坐在江邊很快地吞完。他心裹非常感激漁夫，不知怎樣道謝才好。想了一想，决定摘下腰裹的寶劍，送給漁夫，他十分恭敬地說道：</p>
<p>“感謝老丈救了我倆的性命，使我們脫出楚國的虎口，這種大恩，是永遠不敢忘記的。可是身旁沒有帶得金銀，只有一口防身的寶劍，送給老丈，表示找的一點意思。………”</p>
<p>“哈哈”！漁夫的笑聲打斷了他的話，左手又將寶劍推了回去，“伍將軍，你太看輕我了，我救你，因為你是一個英雄，不是你有這把寶劍。哈哈……”</p>
<p>漁夫的冷笑，燒熱了伍將軍的臉，伍子胥托着寶劍，不知怎樣才好。</p>
<p>“伍將軍，你知道楚王懸賞捉你，我都不貪，這一把寶劍我會收受嗎？將軍，你帶着太子快去吧，我們後會有期。”漁夫嚴肅的態度，鋒利的說話，把伍子胥怔住了；他慚愧地揰好寶劍，還呆呆地望着漁夫去解釋：突然他想起了什麼，就喊道：</p>
<p>“老丈慢走，請教尊姓大名，將來也好報恩。”</p>
<p>漁夫回過臉來，並不答話，慢慢地自語着：“什麼報恩，這就不像英雄口氣。”</p>
<p>但是伍子胥還不走，他跨前一步，膽怯地說道：</p>
<p>“那麼，老丈—你千萬不要把我的消息告訴別人！”</p>
<p>漁夫聽得這麼說，就重新走了過來，臉色也氣青了，咬着顫動的嘴唇，狠狠地把伍子胥望了幾眼，才說道：</p>
<p>“伍將軍，你放心去吧；我死了也不會洩漏你的消息。”</p>
<p>漁夫上了船，看伍子胥還不會轉身，就憤怒地喊道：</p>
<p>“你一定要看我死了才安心嗎？罷！罷！罷！想不到伍將軍是這樣小氣的人。”</p>
<p>伍子胥嚇了一跳，正想分辯的時候，只見漁夫張開兩臂，用脚踏住船舷，只一蹬，小船早翻了身，把漁夫壓在下面，一陣急流，連人帶船都沖走，在暮色蒼靄中消失了。</p>
<h3>兩小姐的密談</h3>
<p>— 順</p>
<p>房門緊閉着，兩位小姐在裹面低聲密談！</p>
<p>江小姐：剛才在路上，我問你近來怎麼容顏枯黃？你為甚麼不向我說明呢？</p>
<p>劉小姐：在路上說話很不便常，現在我告訴你，因為平素我的月經不調，時常覺得腰腿酸軟，腹脹頭痛，我也不介意；不料近來這種現象更增加了，使我的肉體和精神都很痛苦！所以你看我的容貌也顯得衰老！</p>
<p>江小姐：啊，原來是為了這事，這祗要去買五洲藥房的‘月月紅’來吃，月經就會通暢有序，體態也可以恢復健美了。</p>
<p>劉小姐：你怎麼知道這藥有如此的靈效呢？</p>
<p>江小姐：從前我也患過月經困難的毛病，後來就靠‘月月紅’把我的毛病治好。</p>
<h3>無冕的阿皇在英維持小朝廷</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>忍淚看江山，不堪回首</p>
<p>號稱萬王之王猶太之獅的阿比西尼亞國皇帝海爾塞拉亞，目前住在－座小山巔上的灰色石屋中，他所統治的地方，不過兩英畝。他曾很率直地說道：“凡人憂在心頭時，所住的地方，確然不足合意。”但是他對於自己的前途，依然像住在阿狄斯阿巴巴（阿京）時的堅信</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>不疑，他至今仍抱着恢復他帝國統治權的希望。他在阿比西尼亞的宮邸，雖已被意兵列隊出入，他依然在英國鄕野中維持一小朝廷。他在左右忠心侍臣數人中依然言出卽為法律，但出了園門之外，便毫無威權。</p>
<p>自從意大利王加了阿比西尼亞皇帝的尊號以後，最近戈柴年誌中已將阿比西尼亞皇族的數頁刪除，這位無𤲈之皇目下靜居在築於峻峭的山邊一所別墅中，那別墅可望見有礦泉的巴資城，四面綠樹成蔭，很覺幽靜。他在裹面安閒地隱居着，從不出臨大庭廣衆之前，也難得跟當地社會仕女會晤。凡往見他的人仍須行朝見的禮式，先在門外通報，然後由一位身高七呎的侍衛帶領到一間高大的方室中，那愁眉雙鎖的皇帝，整日在室中消磨他的光陰。壁上掛着他的殘破江山的地圖，架上滿堆着書籍，書案上散播許多文牘。他時常靜立窗前，遙望巴資古城，那是他敵人的祖宗在數百年前攻人英倫時建築的。鄰室中有幾位御用的職員在打字機上修函，原來他現在仍破費他的私囊，維持倫敦巴黎日內瓦三處的阿國公使館來往的函牘，源源不絕。</p>
<p>他的侍衛雖已改穿薩維爾式漂亮的服裝，但他本人，却仍然玄袍白褲，加上一項扁冠，這套裝束，全世界各處電影新聞片子上已見慣了的。他自從離開阿狄斯巴巴，出奔外國以後，舉止沒有什麼變化，他接見來賓時，依然一見如故，但他仍盼望引見的人稱他為“陛下”</p>
<p>美聯社記者某日曾往謁見，他對記者說道：“我决不放棄我的希望。”他否認想移居歐洲他處之說，并且說道：“我自從被迫出國後，英人侍我很好，目前我决計留住在這兒，我仍希望有一天回到阿比西尼亞。”</p>
<p>他雖然承認戈爾政府已不復存在，但仍稱，在未被意軍佔據的地方，現在還有一種代表阿皇的行政組織。他又傲然說道：“有那些境內，我的人民仍在奮鬥，以求保全他們的自由哩。”記者問道：“陛下願在意大利保護之下回阿比西尼亞麼？”他聳肩答道：“倘若國聯這麼指導。”記者又問，“難道陛下還信國聯麼？”“我們常望由國聯得到些稍為滿意的事”這是他的簡單答語。阿皇不願討論他的財政地位，但是一般人都相信他因為維持使館，保留他們的職員，已用去不少金錢。最近他在倫敦賣去一批白銀，約得英金二千五百鎊。他談起這事，說是為環境所迫，不得不出此一舉他又說：“我現在用不着金錢，因為找在這兒，并沒有什麼應酬。”</p>
<h3>鎖</h3>
<p>— 申氷</p>
<p>我用謹愼的鎖鎖住了寒酸的囊篋和可憐的抽屜。每天，我抓着成串琅琅然的鑰匙在手裹，像一個握有很大的財產的人那麼地得意着。可是，鎖却是代表着人類的恥辱，狡黠和悲哀。</p>
<p>我的破舊的籐皮的囊篋鎖住着過了時的舊短衫，父親讓給我的毛葛的夾袍子，——父親的身材跟我相彷彿，但是對於我它却太侷促了——和幾年來我所有的日常生活的衣著，應酬生活的衣著。被衣魚蝕穿了的，被烟蒂燒焦了的。全被樟腦丸的氣味薰染着，全被古舊的記憶薰染着然而用謹愼的鎖鎖起囊篋來我並沒有謹愼的意思。</p>
<p>我的抽屜是凌亂的。一切都是暫時和隨便。每一個星期尾，看見抽屜狼籍的局面，我像一個不高明的醫生那麼地扼腕了。荒涼地給扔在角落裹的墨水瓶擺出苦喪的臉，訴說着它脖子上的灰塵，稿箋訴說着它被摺斷了腰肢，淋漓着的墨漬，和它的受奚落的字紙簏裹的命運——稿箋有二四×二五格的切細的難以填補的空白——那付不完整的硯台，殘疾的徽州墨，幾年間同甘苦的秃筆，全以怨懟的眼光衝着它們的主人直望，一點辦法也沒有地我搓了搓手。</p>
<p>寒酸的囊篋和可憐的抽屜像貴重的銀物似地被掩藏着。</p>
<p>我用謹愼的鎖鎖住了寒酸的衣箱和可憐的抽屜。每天，我抓着成串琅琅然的鑰匙在手裹，像一個握有很大的財產的人那麼地得意着。可是，鎖却是代表着人類的恥辱，狡黠和悲哀。</p>

<p>中西（一○四○）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「寳玉哭靈」</p>
<p>烟飄飄飄滿一爐香。黯淡淡淡煜素燭光。白漾漾靈帳高掛起。火熊熊錠帛化幾張。巔巍巍木主中間坐。静俏俏紙婢立兩旁。灰蓬蓬蓬灰乾點心。冷冰冰冰冷一盞湯。黑黝黝五尺桐棺木。光閃閃七燈色昏黄。苦哀哀哀苦紫娟女。淚盈盈盈淚滴兩行。走沙沙來了多情子。思㷀㷀憂鬱愁滿腔。一歩歩歩入靈堂內。口泣泣泣聲裂肝腸。輕微微呼喚林妹妹。請聽聽從頭説端詳。情綿綿共讀西廂記。意濃濃聯吟在海棠。氣冲冲園內葬花去。急忙忙前來勸悲傷。病懨懨嬌軀熬不住。倦迷迷横到小牙床。夜深深探病瀟湘館。風扇扇伴爐煎藥湯。情屬屬終想鸞儔結。緣薄薄竟成夢一塲。喜洋洋堂前花燭拜。細看看豈知代桃僵。昏沉沉沉昏站不穩。神懸懸懸神魂飄蕩。怨恨恨恨煞二嫂嫂。潑辣辣辣手毒心腸。惡很很人心不古道。虚僞僞哄我做新郎。休怨怨怨我情太薄。難酬酬酬卿命不延長。渺茫茫已歸黄泉路。哭聲聲何來返魂香。髮剃剃願入空門去。遠離離撇下舊家鄉。一陣陣静聽木魚聲。再修修來生作鴛鴦。心酸酸如何想得盡。願卿卿靈魂到天堂。心悔悔禪門度時光。</p>

<h3>大光明映「霧夜拯美記」</h3>
<p>嫓美考爾門主演的「霧夜飛屍案」</p>
<p>許許影迷們還記得吧，在兩年以前，考爾門曾主演過一部片子呌「霧夜飛屍案，」在滬上公映的時候，曾經轟動遐邇。現在這部「霧夜拯美記」Bulldcg　Drummond　Escapes的故事，就是緊接着「霧夜飛屍案」的情節，述那綽號「猘犬」的大偵探堀勒門，又在倫敦一個大霧迷漫的晚間，連破兩樁奇案，救得一位美人，較之「霧夜飛屍案」，還要緊張奇突，主演此片的是「獸國女皇」主角雷密倫及葛史丹亭爵士，希珊安琪兒等三明兒，片爲派拉蒙公司出品，今日起在大光明大戲院公映云。</p>
<h3>「慈母曲」</h3>
<p>倫理片的新標本</p>
<p>秉性孝順的人看了「慈母曲」，可以撫躬無愧，益知自勉，生來頑逆的人看了「慈母曲」，可知警惕，從速改善，得做完人。—它予人以道德的啟示，同時也于人以藝術的撫慰。</p>
<p>「慈母曲」的演出，是用一種極通俗的形式，好像閑話家常一樣，而故事則又曲曲折折，妮妮動人，每個觀衆都易於接受。</p>
<p>西片中也有名「慈母」的，曾經轟動世界，受盡世人的歡迎。看過西片「慈母」的觀衆，尤其應該看「慈母曲」，因爲「慈母曲」是完全以東方色彩，中國情調寫出來的，較「慈母」一片，更爲體貼細膩。</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Releases Statement</h3>
<p>Met With Tashiro Several Times, Did Not Discuss Diplomacy; Economic Development to Start With Mining and Road Construction</p>
<p>[Beiping] When meeting with reporters on the morning of the 10th, Song Zheyuan said that during his stay in Tianjin for over a month, he had met with Acting Commander Tashiro several times, but these were only ordinary social gatherings and did not involve any specific diplomatic issues. Regarding diplomacy, there are diplomats responsible for it. He only knows to follow the intentions of the Central Government and consider the actual situation to seek benefits for the locality. He has always advocated supporting the Central Government and stabilizing the locality. Nitpicking at the Central Government is the biggest mistake. Therefore, he will continue to uphold this principle in the future, striving to ensure that the local people live and work in peace and contentment. Regarding economic development, he will still adhere to the principles of coexistence, co-prosperity, equality, and mutual benefit, starting with the development of mineral resources and the construction of railways. The current projects underway are the construction of the Cangshi Road and the mining of the Longyan iron ore. He has had many contacts with the Japanese side, but concrete measures have not yet been decided. The rumor that construction of the Cangshi Road is about to begin is not accurate. The Japanese army's plan to expand barracks in Fengtai has been shelved due to public opposition. He had originally planned to return to his ancestral home in Leling during the Spring Festival to sweep the tombs, but due to the cold weather and inconvenience, it did not happen. He may go when the weather warms up. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Preliminary Agreement Signed for Export of Lu Salt to Japan</h3>
<p>To be Submitted to Both Governments for Approval; First Batch to be 100,000 Tons</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The preliminary agreement for the export of Lu salt to Japan was signed at the Changlu Transportation Office at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th, one day ahead of schedule. The Japanese representative was Hirayama Keizo of the Xingzhong Corporation, and the director of the Salt Affairs Department was Kiyono Jotaro. The Chinese representatives were Li Shuhua, the Changlu Transport Commissioner; Li Menglu, the special commissioner of the Hebei-Chahar Economic Council; Shao Jingyin, manager of the Lufeng Store; and Xu Xianfang, the assistant manager. The signing was completed at 4:00 PM. Li Menglu returned to Beiping in the evening to report to Li Sihao. The agreement will be submitted to both governments for approval, and then four official copies will be drafted and stored by the relevant authorities on both sides, as well as by the buyers and sellers. The preliminary agreement consists of ten articles, the main points of which are that the first batch will be 100,000 tons at a price of 2.3622 yuan per ton. The Xingzhong Corporation sent an official letter to the Lufeng Store, reserving the right to purchase an additional 130,000 tons, but a separate agreement must be signed for this. The buyer has the freedom to increase or decrease the quantity by 5%. The shipping period will begin in early March and end at the end of this year. Export will only be possible after the Tianjin Customs receives an order from the Ministry of Finance. Payment for the salt will be made in advance before loading, and the full amount will be paid upon completion of half of the export quantity. After the agreement is established, the seller shall not sell to anyone other than the buyer for transport to Japan, and the buyer shall not directly purchase or transport from other salt flats. Currently, there are only 700,000 tons of Lu salt stored in the Dagu salt flats. The Transportation Office fears that signing an agreement for the Japanese side to purchase 230,000 tons at once will affect the food supply for the people, so it will only sign the second batch of the agreement after there is a surplus.

The members selected this time are all eminent figures in traditional Chinese medicine and will certainly make great contributions. He hoped that a selective approach would be adopted to facilitate learning and management, such as anatomy, pathology, immunology, and bacteriology, which are all auxiliary to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. Chen replied that the establishment of the committee was still based on the advocacy of previous years and that he would strive to encourage himself with three things: 1. To integrate the academic knowledge of Chinese and Western medicine into one to form a new Chinese-based medicine. 2. To enable traditional Chinese medicine practitioners across the country to benefit from scientific education so that they can share the great responsibility of improving the health of the people with Western medicine at the same level. 3. In the past, many medical disputes arose from misunderstandings, which should be avoided in the future. The proposals of the meeting included: 1. Should the application for traditional Chinese medicine certificates in various provinces and cities be handled by the committee or issued by the local government? 2. Designating several people to study traditional Chinese medicine schools and determine standards. 3. Requesting the establishment of training classes for traditional Chinese medicine health. 4. Formulating measures for the registration of traditional Chinese medicine associations to be approved and promulgated. 5. How should the sale of proprietary Chinese medicines in various pharmacies be reorganized and standardized? 6. Proposing to add provisions to the regulations on the review of traditional Chinese medicine concerning graduates of traditional Chinese medicine schools established by the Song Jingjiao Ministry or educational authorities, requesting that they be allowed to apply the regulations on the review of traditional Chinese medicine when applying for certificates. 7. Proposing the compilation of a Practical Dictionary of Chinese Materia Medica and the establishment of a Chinese Medicine Hospital, etc., totaling fourteen proposals. At the same time, the General Assembly issued a circular to the whole country, announcing the establishment of the Committee on Traditional Chinese Medicine. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Minnan Zhangzhou Bandit Wen Yaye Executed</h3>
<p>Bandit Inflicted Cruelty on Several Counties, Killing Hundreds and Burying Dozens Alive</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: After the troops stationed in Zhangzhou (Yunxiao, Zhao'an, Pinghe, Zhangpu) suppressed the communist bandits, the area along the Longxi Road became peaceful. The bandit areas of Yunxiao and Zhao'an were also recovered. The remaining bandits fled back to their old nests in Liangshan in Pinghe and Wushan in Yunxiao, and established a fake Yun Zhao and Rao Border Region Committee, causing disturbances in the border region of the four counties of Yunxiao, Zhao'an, He, and Rao between Fujian and Guangdong. The troops stationed in Yunxiao continued to encircle and suppress Wushan. On March 1, the troops stationed there, together with the strong men of seven villages in the 11th District, captured the bandit leader Wen Yaye, the fake border region committee member, and four others: Li Xin-chun, Zhan Shun-shi (fake transport), Zhan Lian-tai (fake propagandist). Two pistols and two bombs were seized. Wen had been engaged in propaganda work in Zhangzhou for many years, and the bandit nest in Wushan was created by him. He was extremely cruel, and tens of thousands of families were ruined because of him. On March 2, the troops stationed there executed Wen and Li Xin-chun. The families of the victims trampled on their corpses, and some even cut out their hearts to vent their anger. The troops also prepared a bulletin of Wen's crimes, stating: "The notorious bandit Wen Yaye has long been engaged in propaganda work in the Yun (xiao), Zhao (an), He, and other border regions. A large number of intellectuals with weak will and ignorant good people in various places have been deceived and blindly followed him. Hundreds of people have been burned, killed, and robbed by the bandit leader's rifles and knives. Fifty or sixty people have been captured and buried alive. On March 1, he was captured by our army while propagating communism to the people in Wushi Resistance. Wen Yaye, the fake border region committee member of Yun (xiao), Zhao (an), and He, and Li Xin-chun, the fake transport member, were interrogated and admitted that they had been important figures in the bandit party for many years, which warrants the death penalty to appease the people." Wen was a native of Raoping, Guangdong, 26 years old. (March 7)</p>
<h3>Anhui Business Community Reorganizes the Provincial Business Federation</h3>
<p>This Proposal Arose Due to Research on Income Tax, and It Will Become a Tool for Developing Commerce Abroad</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Five or six years ago, various counties and towns in Anhui had an organization called the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation. Wuhu, due to its convenient location and transportation and its status as a commercial hub, had the federation's headquarters attached to the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce. Later, due to the economic recession in commerce and finance, the membership fees owed by the chambers of commerce in various counties and towns were not paid, and the work of the Federation itself became unusually slack. The Provincial Government ordered it to cease its activities some years ago, and the only union of merchants in Anhui was once again scattered. This time, the government is promoting income tax, and the procedures involved are most relevant to the interests of merchants. Moreover, the business tax rate in Anhui Province is particularly harsh. Chambers of commerce in important counties and towns in northern and southern Anhui have sent representatives to Wuhu to hold a conference to discuss income tax. In addition to unanimously agreeing to send telegrams to all parties to strive for the cessation or improvement of business tax in order to alleviate the hardships of merchants, many achievements have also been made regarding the points that should be requested for income tax. During the meeting, it was generally agreed that in this era of commercial warfare, it is necessary to reorganize the commercial institutions in various parts of the province. Otherwise, power cannot be concentrated, and the group will hardly be able to develop. It is like a soul without a body, without anything to rely on. After discussion, it was decided to reorganize the Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, and a joint telegram was sent to the Anhui Provincial Party Headquarters requesting the issuance of a permit and the dispatch of personnel to guide the preparations. The original telegram is recorded below: "A petition to initiate the organization of the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, requesting your department to approve the issuance of a permit to facilitate preparations. It has been found that the Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates that there should be an organization of a federation of chambers of commerce in each province, so as to unite industry and commerce throughout the province as a tool for external development. Moreover, in the current world of commercial competition, Anhui Province is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, with abundant products, and it is particularly necessary to develop externally. The members of the association have gathered in Wuhu to discuss and study income tax, and now state the reasons for initiating the organization of the Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation in accordance with Article 37 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, requesting your department to approve the issuance of a permit in accordance with Section 2 of the Third Section of the Organizational Plan of People's Organizations, and to send personnel to guide the preparations, which is truly convenient for the public."

<h3>Japanese House of Peers Questions Foreign Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>Katsuta Criticizes Hirota's Clumsy Diplomacy, Praising the Success of British Policy as a Model to Follow, Sato Clarifies Policy to the House Today</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Naotake will respond tomorrow in the House of Representatives to questions raised by Minseito Party member Tsurumi Yusuke and Seiyukai Party member Ashida Hitoshi. Sato will clarify Japan's foreign policy at that time. (Reuters, Tokyo, 10th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] During a meeting of the Budget Committee of the Japanese House of Peers this morning, after questioning domestic issues, Katsuta Shukei turned to foreign policy. He first criticized the Prime Minister for repeatedly using the term "multilateral diplomacy" in his response to questions from the House of Representatives. He felt that the name "multilateral diplomacy" was "very inappropriate." Katsuta continued, saying that Prime Minister Hayashi's explanation of economic diplomacy was indeed Japan's diplomacy of twenty years ago. Although it was economic in nature at that time, there was never such a name. Japan's main diplomacy towards China is economic diplomacy, but unfortunately it has never been able to show its effect. British diplomacy towards China has been economic diplomacy from beginning to end and has never changed for decades, so it can be successful. Although Japan has established the Yokohama Specie Bank in China, its business is purely foreign exchange and does not have the investment power of HSBC. I feel that we will need to open such a bank in the future. What does the government think? Katsuta then asked, Since the Okada Cabinet, Hirota has promoted the three principles of diplomacy towards China. The spirit is indeed correct, but the method of implementation is clumsy, so Hirota's diplomacy ultimately failed. Foreign Minister Sato Naotake stated that he does not intend to completely change the policies of previous foreign ministers, but will only change what he considers to be unsuitable. Katsuta then said, If so, which aspects of the previous cabinet's foreign policy are suitable, and which are not? Sato replied that matters such as economic diplomacy and the establishment of a HSBC-like bank in China are related to the Ministry of Finance, so he will fully consult with the Ministry of Finance. As for the various points I mentioned at the General Assembly of the House of Peers, they are only policy guidelines and my current state of mind. As for concrete problems, which should be continued and which should be changed, I have not yet decided, and this kind of problem cannot be decided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs alone. It will soon consult with relevant ministries. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The General Budget Meeting of the House of Peers opened at 10:12 a.m. on the 10th. Iwakura Michikata first spoke on the procedural agenda, saying that the deliberation period was insufficient and asked what the government's views were. At that time, Prime Minister Hayashi was absent, so Kodama Vice Minister replied on his behalf, saying that if it was unavoidable, he would give it full consideration. Next, Katsuta Shukei of the Study Group rose and said that the elucidation of the national polity should be fully understood by the entire nation. Why was it deliberately listed as the first principle of the political platform, causing foreigners to misunderstand? He believed that he should be very cautious. Also, recently in the House of Representatives, there were words such as multilateral diplomacy and dual diplomacy. It was found that our country's diplomacy is originally unipolar, not multilateral, and this kind of tone is considered sufficient to make foreigners distrust our country's diplomacy. Therefore, the Prime Minister of a country should be extremely cautious in his statements, especially when openly declaring it on the political platform, which is inappropriate. He should explain the reason. As for the current cabinet, it claims to focus on economic diplomacy, but economic diplomacy has been the focus since twenty years ago. Therefore, the term economic diplomacy is only referred to as diplomacy (and it is not inappropriate to call it economic diplomacy again today, but it is only talk and will have no effect. It has been found that the United Kingdom's policy toward China is all economic diplomacy, and it has been successful for thirty years. If economic diplomacy is to be implemented, a bank like HSBC in the United Kingdom should be established. What is the government's view on this? As for diplomacy toward China, since the Okada Cabinet, there have been so-called three major principles. The other day, Foreign Minister Sato said in his speech to the House of Peers that he would extract the advantages of the previous cabinet's diplomatic policy, saying that he intended to implement it, but what are the advantages, and what are the disadvantages? He should answer.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Sato replied that he believes that it is necessary for our country to imitate HSBC in the United Kingdom in economic diplomacy, which is extremely important and belongs to financial matters, so he should fully consult with the authorities of the Ministry of Finance. As for the various points mentioned in the House of Peers yesterday, they are only a general outline of the policy. He has not yet fully formed an opinion on which policies to follow and which to change. He will try to consult with the ministers concerned in the near future.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yuuki replied that the financial institutions that have existed so far in diplomacy toward China each have their own duties, and their activities cannot be considered sufficient. In the future, they should be made to function fully, and he should fully consult with the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>Katsuta also said that the Foreign Minister, who has only been in office for a short time, is right, but the facts are urgent, and he should quickly seek countermeasures and hope to study the domestic situation and handle it carefully. The so-called new administration of the current cabinet, what kind of ghosts and snakes are they, and what is the bottom line? He should explain it in detail. Secondly, regarding the uneasy situation of the budget, he believes that there are still not enough people who can expand the national power. The current cabinet should establish a certain theory, set the tax system according to its theory, and then study the fundamental methods. This claim is the cause of uneasiness in the world and should clearly explain the future of the budget. After a short break at half past noon, the meeting continued at half past one in the afternoon. Prime Minister Hayashi explained Japan's ideal of building the country and replied as follows: He hopes to be cautious in his use of the language of diplomatic dualization, and he will try his best to avoid terms such as dualization. The so-called new administration is considered to have empty content and makes the people uneasy. He will pay attention to it, but the political platform, whether internal or external, has been carefully considered, to promote national progress and stabilize the people's hearts, to advocate stability, and to eliminate radicalism, in order to implement the government.</p>
<p>Katsuta then said, "What is the government's view on adjusting prices through the budget? What is the approximate amount of money needed for international loans and shipments of currency? The status of currency in the world must be carefully considered, because countries around the world are competing to reserve currency for the purpose of national defense. The current cabinet is handling this matter too hastily, which is chilling. As for amending the Bank of Japan Act and the low-interest policy, please express your general views."</p>
<p>After Finance Minister Yuuki explained everything, Baron Okura Kobo asked a question about establishing a political platform. Prime Minister Hayashi replied with the same feeling, and Prime Minister Hayashi also replied that he was considering the new administration and the establishment of a new advisory national policy agency. The meeting adjourned at 3:55 p.m. (Allied News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Four Ministers Maintain Contact</h3>
<p>In Order to Determine Specific Measures</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato now believes that it is necessary to establish a new diplomatic policy. The first step is to propose the establishment of a meeting of relevant ministers after the closure of the Diet. Its scope is the same as that of the previous cabinet. It is uncertain whether the meeting of the three ministers of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs will become a permanent agency, or whether the ministers concerned should be asked to participate in the consultation at any time, depending on the necessity, and whether the old practice is appropriate. However, the Lin Cabinet's policy toward China is mainly based on the economic view of civilian contact and has a close relationship with the financial authorities. Also, since Finance Minister Yuki had his own views on Sino-Japanese economic diplomacy when he was the president of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he has joined Finance Minister Yuki, and the four ministers of the Army, Navy, Foreign Affairs, and Finance will be the center of the establishment of a four-province affairs authorities meeting in order to start a re-examination of diplomatic policies.

<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Answers Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>Irrelevant</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign reporters visited the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today and asked whether Foreign Minister Sato Naotake's speech in the House of Peers on the 8th of this month could be regarded as Japan changing its attitude and respecting all international agreements signed by Japan. The spokesman replied lightly, saying that he also thought so. When asked about the Nine-Power Treaty, the spokesman replied that he thought so as well. When asked again about Japan's guarantee of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the treaty, the spokesman replied again that he also thought so. At this point, the reporters of various newspapers asked whether the attitude of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs towards Wang Chonghui, as shown by the Asahi Shimbun yesterday, was true. The spokesman said that in principle there should be no problem, because the so-called equality and reciprocity are principles recognized by international law, but if it involves concrete issues such as eastern Hebei and northern Chahar, it should be regarded as another event due to its complexity.

<h3>Japanese Government Defense Room Bill</h3>
<p>Submitted to the House of Representatives</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government submitted the Air Defense Bill to the House of Representatives on the 9th. Its content is to prepare the general public other than the army and navy for air defense under a certain plan. Although there have been air defense exercises in various important cities, there is no legal basis, and the content of the exercises varies from region to region, with no control force. The exercises are only implemented with a temporary plan, so it is difficult to prepare the necessary equipment in the event of an emergency. Therefore, the air defense affairs will be legalized, and air defense plans will be stipulated, and training will be implemented on the basis of this plan from peacetime, and necessary air defense materials will be gradually prepared. The main points are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Elucidate the content of air defense and air defense plans and stipulate the obligations regarding air defense plans;</p>
<p>(2) On the basis of the necessity of air defense, stipulate the scope of orders and implement obligations regardless of conditions such as salary;</p>
<p>(3) Stipulate matters related to air defense training;</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the burden of expenses, make necessary provisions for national treasury subsidies;</p>
<p>(5) Regarding other matters, set up necessary provisions. Based on the above-mentioned guidelines, the Air Defense Bill has a total of twenty-two articles. (Allied News Agency, 10th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Refuses Entry to Japanese Embassy Translator</h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Attaches Importance</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Soviet Union's refusal to allow Japanese Embassy translator Sugihara to enter the country has been repeatedly negotiated with the Soviet government by Ambassador Shigemitsu and Counselor Sugimoto. Recently, when Ambassador Shigemitsu met with Foreign Vice Minister Stomoniakov, he said that such an incomprehensible fact was arousing the Soviet side's attention to the new relationship that Japan and the Soviet Union must develop.

<h3>After Pentecost, the British Prime Minister Will Resign</h3>
<p>Chamberlain to Succeed as Prime Minister</p>
<p>[London] It is rumored that British Prime Minister Baldwin will resign from his position immediately after Pentecost, likely around May 26th. It is said that the Prime Minister has a very busy schedule in the week leading up to May 26th, with appointments every day. The King and Queen are scheduled to host a banquet on the 25th, so the Prime Minister will definitely not have time to submit his resignation in the week before the 26th. Although the above news is not from official sources, it is said with certainty and is likely not without reason. Political reporters here predict that Baldwin will likely be ennobled as an Earl, and MacDonald will also enter the House of Lords. The succession of Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain to the position of Prime Minister is generally considered inevitable. First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare and President of the Board of Trade Runciman are said to be the most promising candidates for the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer.

<h3>German Ambassador to Britain Returned to His Post Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rumored to be Carrying New Instructions to Negotiate the Locarno Treaty Issue</p>
<p>[Berlin] German Ambassador to Britain, General Ribbentrop, is scheduled to return to London today. It is generally believed that he is carrying new instructions for negotiating the Western European Pact. Officials here are currently paying close attention to this matter. Germany's second step will likely be to respond to the British memorandum from November of last year. The main points of the reply are currently under consideration. It is generally believed that negotiations will continue through ordinary diplomatic channels in the future, as it seems unlikely that a meeting convened without sufficient preparation would be successful. Political circles here believe that the Spanish issue may be resolved soon, so they are quite optimistic about the outcome of these negotiations. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>Dublin: The draft of the new constitution of the Irish Free State has now been completed and is scheduled to be submitted to the House of Representatives on the 11th of this month. The House will propose several amendments during the first reading and hold a second reading after Easter to begin debate.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Significance of Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Recently, noteworthy international economic developments include: in Europe, France abolished foreign exchange controls and resumed a liberal policy; the Geneva League of Nations raw materials conference discussed the issue of raw material allocation; and in East Asia, Japan's economic policy has recently become very active. The Japanese Diet has clearly outlined the establishment of a Japanese-"Manchukuo" economic system, and economic envoys such as Kodama will depart for China tomorrow. The Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China is also preparing to hold a joint meeting in Shanghai. It is said that among its 26 proposals, 11 involve requesting negotiations to reduce tariffs. All of these economic activities directly or indirectly target China.</p>
<p>Since our country has become a target of Japan's economic development, we must deeply understand Japan's economic objectives. This information is readily available. Recently, the Japanese representative made a frank statement at the League of Nations raw materials conference, saying, "Making it convenient for raw materials to enter Japan is not enough to alleviate the current difficulties. It is necessary to simultaneously take various measures to facilitate the international trade of industrial manufactured goods." From these words, Japan's intention is to achieve two goals with one arrow, which is very obvious. However, before the import restriction systems of various countries are abolished, how will Japan break the current situation and seek to solve the problem of exporting Japanese goods and collecting raw materials? The answer to this question can be gleaned from the recent response of the Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry to the Diet members: "Manchuria produces raw materials. It would be best for Japan to process these raw materials... Currently, we want to combine Japan and Manchuria into one economic group... In fact, the tea production plan in Manchuria and its funding are all created by Japan. If Manchuria is threatened by China in this way, it would be a great humiliation for our country (Japan's commerce)..." Such is Japan's fundamental intention for economic development. Therefore, the nature of so-called economic cooperation is easy to imagine. Even if we set this aside, it is not difficult to understand the meaning of this new term simply by examining the current facts. In recent years, textile industries in Tianjin and Qingdao have successively fallen into the hands of the Japanese. Currently, Japanese merchants own more than three million spindles in Chinese textile mills. Not only is the Shanghai yarn market unable to be as independent as it once was, but it is also often constrained by the Qingdao yarn market. It is feared that before long, not only North China but also the entire country's textile industry will be completely controlled by them. Isn't the soy bean cake market's control by the Dalian specialty market in recent years a clear example? Furthermore, everyone knows that smuggling in North China is a situation created by special forces, not a result of tariff policy. However, the other side still talks about negotiating tax reductions. Although they claim that regular merchants do not want to collude and are unwilling to suffer losses, they make this request. It should be known that even if taxes are increased before the situation in eastern Hebei is restored, smuggling may be stopped. Moreover, tax reduction is a fatal blow to China's original industry and commerce.</p>
<p>In short, those who plot against us are thorough, and it is only natural that they have plans and steps. We can only strive for what is called equality and mutual benefit to be consistent with the name and reality.</p>

<h3>Spanish Nationalist Forces Launch Major Offensive</h3>
<p>Government Forces Resist Vigorously but Fail - Fate of Madrid Depends on This Battle</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid: A battle is currently raging about 65 miles northeast of Madrid, the scale of which is rare since the beginning of the civil war. The fate of Madrid may depend on this battle. After receiving heavy support, the Nationalist army launched a new offensive yesterday. As a result of the day's fighting, they advanced seven and a half miles along a broad front. The Nationalist army aims to further reduce the area surrounding Madrid and the main roads connecting the capital to the outside world through the Jingdong area. After gaining ground yesterday, they continued their fierce attack today. Although the government army's communiqué today acknowledged yesterday's retreat, it said that they are still bravely resisting the enemy. After fierce battles on the Guadalajara front yesterday, government forces were attacked on the Madrid front by a superior enemy force from the north. According to a communiqué from the Defense Committee, government forces were forced to retreat on the Corroel Villa front, and the enemy is still advancing there. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>Incident of Western Government Merchant Ship Being Bombed</h3>
<p>Crew and Passengers All Shot - Only Two Escape by Swimming</p>
<p>⊙ Hendaye: The command of the San Sebastian fortress in Spain announced today that the "Mar Cantabrico" ship has safely arrived at the Nationalist-controlled port of Faro in the Bay of Biscay. (National News dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Paris] After the Spanish government army's merchant ship "Mar Cantabrico" was sunk yesterday by the Nationalist cruiser "Canarias" in the Bay of Biscay, the newspaper's special correspondent in Argèles-sur-Mer (in southern France) reported on the circumstances of the ship being attacked, stating that the "Mar Cantabrico" was carrying 133 crew members and ten passengers, of whom only a Spaniard named Juan Pujol and another Italian were able to escape by swimming. Mr. Pujol was rescued by a French fishing boat after entering the water. According to his account, all the crew members and passengers of the "Mar Cantabrico," including Italians and people from various South American countries, were ordered to be shot by the captain of the "Canarias," without exception. Before the attack, the "Canarias" had ordered the "Mar Cantabrico" to stop immediately, but the "Mar Cantabrico" ignored it and continued to sail full speed ahead, intending to escape. The Canarias then opened fire, hitting the ship's side and immediately starting a fire, and sending out a radio distress signal. At this time, sailors from the Canarias boarded the Mar Cantabrico and took control. When nearby ships received the distress signal and came to rescue, they were rejected by the Canarias, saying that no assistance was needed. After boarding the ship, the sailors searched the crew and passengers, killing them on sight, without any mercy. The sound of gunshots was constant, and each gunshot meant the death of a companion. The scene was brutal and unimaginable. The place where I (Juan Pujol) was hiding was almost discovered. Although I was fortunate enough to escape, I still shudder when I recall the sound of gunfire.

<h3>U.S. President Appeals to the People for Support of Judicial Reform</h3>
<p>Judges Should Fulfill Their Judicial Duties - Should Not Interfere with Legislative Power</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt gave a special radio address to the nation tonight on the plan to reform the federal judicial system, saying that for four years, the actions of the Supreme Court have no longer been those of a judicial body, but have become those of a body that formulates national policy. We have endured this to this point and have no choice but to find a way to free the Constitution from the constraints of the Court. The actions of the Supreme Court must conform to the Constitution and not exceed its scope. The President further said that four years ago, when he first gave a radio address, the nation's banks were in a state of collapse, and the government ordered cash to be nationalized. Judging from today's recovery, it can be seen that the policy adopted was not wrong, but the Supreme Court at that time only ruled by a vote of five to four that the current nationalization law did not violate the Constitution. If there had been a difference of one vote, the national plan would have been hopeless. The four judges who voted against the law at that time even believed that private contracts to pay off debts by selling flesh were more sacred and inviolable than the goal of the American Constitution to establish the foundation of the nation. The function of the Constitution is to consolidate the foundation of the nation and promote the welfare of the people, so Congress has broad powers to levy taxes to achieve this goal. In modern times, laws are often made to seek progress in all aspects of society and the economy, but the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected them, so that the laws passed by Congress to balance agricultural production, improve the lives of workers, protect commercial competition, and cultivate national resources must all be decided by the Supreme Court whether they should be implemented. The Court is in fact no different from an Upper Congress. The people of the country certainly want an independent judicial body, but it cannot be so independent as to not recognize universally recognized facts. The President also argued that although some people advocate amending the Constitution to seek reform, these people are also sufficient to obstruct the points that should be amended. The meaning of the Amendment to the Constitution must also be interpreted by the Supreme Court. As for the rumors that the President can appoint private individuals as judges, Roosevelt replied that he would be willing to appoint judges who do not overturn the decisions passed by Congress on legislative policy. In other words, he would be willing to appoint judges who can fulfill their judicial duties and not interfere with legislative power. Therefore, he advocated that the reform plan should be passed within the term of the current Congress so that the American judicial system can have progressive ideas as soon as possible.

<h3>French National Defense Bond Bill Passed by the Chamber of Deputies</h3>
<p>Right-Wing Amendment Rejected - Bonds to be Issued Today</p>
<p>[Paris] The government's bill on the issuance of national defense bonds and the amendment of the current monetary law, namely ① the current fixed buying, selling, exporting, and importing of gold can now be done freely, ② The government should compensate people who sold their gold to the government before the passage of this bill at a price lower than the current price. The Chamber of Deputies presented it for discussion this afternoon and passed it with a very large majority vote of 470 votes to 46 votes. It is expected that the Senate will also quickly approve it when it discusses it tomorrow. It is reported that the national defense bonds may be issued starting on the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>During the discussion in the Chamber of Deputies today, Prime Minister Blum gave a speech, requesting that the Chamber of Deputies unanimously pass the government's proposal. His words included: "The measures that the government should take are the urgent needs of our country at present, and not for the government's own sake. It is our common goal that these measures can be achieved as soon as possible. Therefore, the government specially appeals to all members of the Chamber of Deputies." After the Prime Minister finished speaking, members of various parties successively expressed their opinions, which are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>① Right-wing members, especially the leader of the Republican Federation, former Minister without Portfolio Marland, immediately proposed a reservation and continued to demand that members of all parties in Congress form a committee to supervise the use of national defense bonds. This amendment was ultimately rejected by the Chamber of Deputies by a vote of 367 votes to 136 votes. ② Central members, especially former Finance Minister Reno, former Navy Minister Petit, and former Prime Minister Flandin, although they criticized the government's general policies, all announced that they would vote in favor of national defense bonds. Renault briefly said that he firmly believed that the issuance of national defense bonds would be successful, but even this alone was not enough. The main problem at present lies in increasing production, so the government's economic policy should also be revised at the same time as the financial policy. Petit stated that he and his political allies agreed with the government's changes to fiscal policy, especially the reduction of 600 million francs in expenditures, and would naturally vote in favor. Flandin also said that he would vote in favor of national defense bonds and hoped that capitalists in Britain and the United States would subscribe to these bonds, but the interest on the bonds should be as low as possible so as not to compete with France's existing securities. ③ Left-wing members all supported the bill proposed by the government, especially the Vice-President of the Chamber of Deputies, Communist member Dugrolo, said that although the party criticized the restoration of freedom to the gold market, it would still vote in favor of the National Defense Bond Act. Ultra-left member Pécheré said that he hoped that the government would abide by the spirit of the Popular Front. Radical Socialist Party official Gambin also supported the bill proposed by the government on behalf of the party. Finally, the Chamber of Deputies voted to pass the government's bill.

<h3>British Home Office Budget Increases Sharply</h3>

<h3>Conference on Raw Materials Continues General Debate</h3>
<p>Netherlands Declares Open-Door Policy in Its Colonies - U.S. Representative Strongly Advocates Free Trade Policy</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Administrative Council's Committee on Raw Materials continued its general debate this afternoon, with Polish representative Rostosky giving a speech, stating that the availability of raw materials is a matter of life and death for Poland. Poland advocates that two subcommittees should be established to study the issue of raw material allocation from the financial and colonial perspectives, respectively. The representative of the Union of South Africa then spoke, supporting the claims of Sir Leith-Ross of Britain, and insisted that food should be included in the investigation, and said that for those who complain about the shortage of raw materials, it should be investigated whether their words are true, and whether the difficulties they feel are due to the policies implemented by other countries or their own countries. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Then, Dutch representative Gerden gave a speech, stating that the Dutch government has always adopted an open-door policy in the Dutch East Indies. Dutch goods imported into the archipelago account for only 13% of the total imports, which is a lower percentage than any other country's colony that adopts an open-door policy. In addition, Japanese representative Shuto once proposed that there should be a fixed ratio between the amount of industrial imports and the amount of raw material exports as a standard, but the number of industrial products imported into the Dutch East Indies is far greater than the number of raw materials exported, which is contrary to the standard proposed by Shuto. The authorities of the Dutch East Indies had no choice but to take various appropriate measures to restore the balance of foreign trade and enable the colony's products to be sold. As for the financial policy adopted in the archipelago, it is more generous than other countries' colonies in terms of foreign investment. For example, the amount of Dutch investment in the island, excluding the sugar industry, accounts for only 62% of the total investment in the island, which is clear evidence.</p>
<p>Czech representative Pospisil then spoke, stating that the solution to the various difficulties of the current situation is to take gradual measures to restore free trade policy.</p>
<p>Then, U.S. representative Grady rose to speak, advocating that the current import quota system and preferential tariff system of various countries should be abolished, and all colonies should adopt an open-door policy. He also said that the reason why some countries have difficulty obtaining raw materials is often due to barter agreements.</p>
<p>Belgian representative Shearer then spoke, saying that since Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Portugal, and Turkey signed the Berlin Treaty in 1885, establishing a free trade zone in various African territories, the Belgian Congo colony has always adopted an open-door policy, which should now be promoted to all colonies. As for the food issue, it should not be included in the agenda of this committee, because there has been no monopoly or shortage. In conclusion, he advocated that free trade policy should be restored immediately, and countries with sufficient capital should provide financial assistance to countries lacking capital so that they can purchase raw materials.</p>
<p>At this point, Assistant Director-General of the International Labour Office Morel spoke, supporting the British representative Sir Leith-Ross's opposition to the transfer of colonies belonging to various countries, and finally, Brazilian representative Muniz spoke, saying that the raw material issue is one of the most important issues of the League of Nations. If this issue can be resolved, most of the causes of war can be eliminated. Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Competing for Prime Minister in the House of Representatives Seats</h3>
<p>Struggling Against the Rexist Party</p>
<p>⊙Brussels News Mr. Olivié, a Rexist Party member of the House of Representatives, resigned from his position as a representative of the capital region. The party leader, Degrelle, will also follow suit. It has been decided that when a by-election is held for the seat vacated by Olivié, he will stand as a candidate. Prime Minister Janson recently declared in the House of Representatives that he would compete with Degrelle as a joint candidate representing the three major government parties (namely the Catholic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Liberal Party). (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, September)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels News The Rexist Party, in an attempt to increase its number of seats in the House of Representatives, has decided to have its current members resign in succession, and then resign again after being re-elected. This cycle will continue in order to cause disruption and force a general election. The government, aware of this scheme, has submitted a bill to the House, arguing that members who leave office for reasons other than accidental ones, especially those who resign and then participate in by-elections in an attempt to cause disruption, should not have a by-election held. The House of Representatives debated this bill yesterday and passed it by a vote of 20 to 26. However, the law does not have retroactive effect, so it does not apply to the recent resignation of Rexist Party member Olivié in the capital region, and a by-election will still be held. Prime Minister Janson announced in the House yesterday that he would stand as a candidate to compete with the Rexist Party, stating that the government could have proposed a bill to abolish the by-election system altogether, but he believed it would be better for the government leader to stand as a candidate. He added, "My participation in this election does not represent any political party. I am only seeking a solution to revive the nation based on the will of the people." After the Prime Minister finished speaking, all members of the House, except for the Communist Party, the Flemish Nationalist Party, and the Rexist Party, applauded in approval.

<h3>England Continues to Operate Aviation Services Between Penang and Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[London] Viscount Swinton, the Secretary of State for Air, announced today the recommendation to continue the trial aviation service between Penang and Hong Kong. It is said that this service will continue to be handled until other arrangements are made for first-class mail to and from Hong Kong to be transported by air. Therefore, it is currently planned to conclude a contract with Imperial Airways to maintain the current route of Penang, Saigon, Hue (or Da Nang), and Hong Kong, with one flight per week to each location, for a period of twelve months from March 23 of this year. If other arrangements are made to connect the Hong Kong route with the Imperial Airways route, the contract may be cancelled with two weeks' notice. As for the temporary business subsidy, it will be a maximum of £12,500 per full year, and may be reduced if it is less than one year. The Hong Kong government has been asked to provide one-sixth of the funds. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, September 9)</p>

<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Continuing to Request Exemption from Collection</p>
<p>The county's collection office for arrears in rent has been established for more than ten years. At that time, for every silver dollar collected from the renters, 15 cents were deducted for various public expenses, and 2 cents were deducted for warehouse start-up costs and 5 cents for security costs, totaling 12 cents per dollar. At that time, the original plans were all temporary in nature. However, up to today, they have not been cancelled. The rent collection is sluggish, and taxes are not being generated. Therefore, before the preparation of the county's 25th year local budget, the renters believed that the warehouse and security fees were an additional burden, lacking legal balance. Moreover, the security fee has always been listed under county tax items, and should be planned comprehensively within the county's local budget. Therefore, they repeatedly requested exemption in the state budget, but were not approved. At the time of preparing the 26th year budget, the renters continued to apply in order to alleviate the people's hardships.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Planning to Organize a Literature Exhibition</p>
<p>The Wu Chinese Literature Exhibition was held in Suzhou and achieved excellent results. It has now closed. The gentry in this area also had the motivation to hold a Haiyu Literature Exhibition. Because this county is known for its culture and is the hometown of Yan Zi, there are many historical sites and treasures in various collections. Currently, Qu Liangshi, a bibliophile from the Tieqin Tongjian Lou (Iron Zither Bronze Sword Pavilion), along with literati Zhang Yin Nan and Yan Zi's descendants, are planning to initiate the exhibition. The location is planned to be in the Zhishan Hall of the Shimei Reading Terrace. At that time, the Tieqin Tongjian Lou will display all of its treasured items. In addition, collections will be gathered from various places.</p>
<p>Tomb Relocation Unearths Artifacts</p>
<p>In order to build the Huanshan Road in this county, the tombs along the route must be relocated. Near the Tanglongfang outside Beidou, at an old tomb of the Jiang family, the engineering office instructed the owner to relocate it. However, their descendants were poor and only collected 15 legal tender dollars to start work. They then unearthed four coffins, all made of nanmu wood. Below, there was a pit containing two pairs of jade bowls, one gold ruyi, one inkstone tile, and one water bowl. Among them, the jade bowls and inkstone tile are the most valuable. It is said that the tomb belongs to Jiang Yuanshu of the Qing Dynasty, who served as the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi and the Taiwan Circuit. At that time, due to a mistake, he was dismissed and executed.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Widening the Street Inside the North Gate</p>
<p>The previous county administration meeting decided to rebuild the Beiyuecheng (North Moon City), demolishing and rebuilding the old Yuecheng, increasing the height and widening the city gate, which would cost about 7,000 yuan. Also, widening the section of the street from Beiyuecheng Main Street to Fuxing Road would cost about 13,000 yuan, totaling more than 20,000 yuan. The county government has submitted this to the provincial government for approval and will allocate the funds from the municipal administration budget. However, the width of the road was previously set at eight meters, but some merchants in that section requested that it be changed to six meters, and the dispute has not been resolved. It is now planned to submit the actual situation to the Construction Committee for discussion and decision.</p>
<p>Investigation Reveals Huge Losses</p>
<p>The county government previously received a provincial order to thoroughly rectify the land tax and eliminate malpractices. A special investigation committee was formed and many investigators were recruited. Starting from July 1 of last year, the tax receipts from the 16th year of the Republic to the 24th year were investigated year by year. After eight months of work, it has recently been completed. According to the previous land tax director Zhu Kaiguan's report on the land prices and taxes for each year, from the date of collection to the date of the transfer of the investigation, the inventory of collected and uncollected receipts, the detailed verification of the listed collected and uncollected amounts, are generally consistent. However, the number of receipts checked and the number of receipts inventoried are very different, and there are shortages in each year. It is estimated that from the 17th year to the 24th year, the total loss is 97,169 yuan, 4 jiao, 7 fen, and 2 li of silver. In addition to reporting the detailed amount of losses over the years to the Provincial Department of Finance for review, County Magistrate Long ordered the former land tax director Zhu Kaiguan (currently the deputy manager of the Shanghai Fish Market) to be responsible for compensating the payment and to take measures to pay it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Textile Industry Actively Expanding</p>
<p>This county's Shenxin, Qingfeng, Guangqin, Yukang and other textile factories have developed well last year and have made profits, which Qianfeng has never had before. In addition, Lixin, Zhenxin, Gengyu and other cloth factories also have surpluses. All factories are now actively expanding internally, resulting in a great shortage of existing female workers. Therefore, they are recruiting and training apprentices to train new workers to meet the needs. Lixin originally had more than 10,000 yarn spindles, but this year it decided to add more than 30,000 spindles. Gengyu Cloth Factory also added 30,000 spindles to engage in spinning. In addition, Xia Tieqiao, a local resident, raised 500,000 yuan to purchase 90 mu of land near Changyuan Bridge and established the Weixin Dyeing and Weaving Factory. It plans to purchase 150 cloth machines and start work on July 1.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>New Director of Lake Field Arrives in Suzhou</p>
<p>Dong Binqian, director of the Taihu Lake Field Clearing Office, was transferred to the position of director of the Wuxi County Business Tax Bureau by order of the Department of Finance. Zhang Zhongning was appointed to fill the vacancy. Zhang arrived in Suzhou on the 10th and will take over on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Loot Xilai Town</p>
<p>In the ninth district of Jiangdu, Xilai Township, the main town, at about 4 PM on the afternoon of the eighth, more than 40 bandits suddenly arrived. Initially, eight or nine people participated in gambling in the town's teahouse, and then suddenly drew out pistols and shouted to prohibit gamblers from making noise, looting all the cash on hand. Then, they fired shots into the air to show their power. Both ends of the town street were cut off by bandits to prevent entry and exit. They went to various shops to search and loot for four hours. Chen, the wife of Xie Yongxiang, the owner of Lu Chen Hang, was shot in the right thigh. At about 8 PM, they began to transport the looted cloth, rice, wheat, clothing, and foreign ornaments onto three bandit ships parked at the river mouth, and left by water and land. In addition to Township Head Tu Zhiguo reporting to the Huang Jue Huai Ziliang Bridge Security Team for investigation, the County Bureau also sent detective team members Wei Xusheng and others to investigate. It is said that the bandits escaped to the Chenjia Village area in the northeast. In addition, the nun Tian Shun Yuanyun of the Shouzhen Nunnery in the township was severely injured by more than 30 bandits who poured kerosene on her and beat her. Tian Shun died en route after having her nipples burnt and getting injections in the city. Yuanyun stayed in the city for treatment, but her injuries were too severe and it was not easy to save her life.</p>
<h3>Gao You</h3>
<p>Bandit Activity Rages Unabated</p>
<p>Recently, bandit activity in this county has raged unabated, with robberies occurring frequently. Wu Zhaoqi, who runs a general store in Jia 8, Bao 9, Zhahe Township, District 1, was robbed by eight or nine bandits of ten silver dollars, twenty strings of copper coins, and about a hundred dollars' worth of goods. Also, four bandits speaking with a scholar's accent came to the home of Yuan Er, a resident behind the Taisan Temple outside Beidou, at midnight on the seventh, and stole many items of clothing before escaping.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Construction of a Weir on the Central River</p>
<p>The Central River, which relates to water conservancy in both Zhenjiang and Danyang counties, has been the subject of dam construction disputes for many years, and has not yet been dredged. Responsible personnel from the two counties of Zhenjiang and Danyang held a special meeting last month. Attendees included Zhang Qingyuan, Magistrate of Zhenjiang County, Liu Yongnian, Director of the Bureau of Construction, Yu Qiuyuan, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Danyang County Government, and the District Chief of District 1. The general consensus was that dam construction on the river had repeatedly caused disputes in the past, and that the initial plan for dredging alone would not completely resolve the problem. Since Danyang is located downstream, the general public would find this difficult to accept. While conscription for labor would unlikely proceed smoothly, it would probably cause other disputes. It was immediately resolved that a request be submitted to the Department of Construction to plan the construction of a permanent rolling stone weir, and at the same time conscript labor to dredge and reorganize the river channel.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Meningitis Spreads More Widely</p>
<p>Cases of meningitis have occurred in Xian, Fengqiao, Shifosi, Wangdian, and other places in the southern countryside of Jiaxing. The county government and the Department of Civil Affairs have sent personnel to investigate and take measures for treatment. A disease prevention center has now been established in Fengqiao and other places to specialize in the prevention and treatment of meningitis. This disease has spread to the county seat. Many children over ten years old have died from meningitis. The course of the disease, from onset to death, is less than a day and a night. The Jiaxing Red Swastika Society has specially purchased vaccines and hired doctors for long-term injections. Residents who receive preventative shots are not charged a penny. Therefore, the number of people who come to the society for injections every day is quite high. Both Chinese and Western doctors are devising methods of prevention and announcing them to all the residents of the county to engage in prevention.</p>
<p>Continuing to Urge Payment of Old Taxes</p>
<p>The results of Jiaxing's collection of land taxes are quite good. More than 70% of the upper term land tax from the 25th year of the Republic has been recovered. Together with old taxes, more than 600,000 yuan has been collected. Now, the third term of old taxes is approaching the urging and collection period. The Department of Finance has specially dispatched Po Letian as a committee member to supervise the old taxes of the counties formerly under Jiaxing, so that he can supervise and urge payment nearby. Yan has already arrived in He the day before yesterday and set up an office to investigate the collection amounts over the years and the actual amount of debt currently owed by the people, so as to instruct the lenient collection personnel to start urging payment. However, this term is when the countryside is focusing on silkworm farming, and it is feared that there will be no surplus funds to pay the old taxes. It is expected that the success of this term's urging and collection will be inferior to the previous two terms.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Major Native Banks Close One After Another</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, since the big settlement this term, the native banks that have closed down because shareholders are unwilling to continue operating include Tongde and Jiekang. Now, Yiyuan Native Bank has also released four or five thousand yuan in accounts receivable in Yuhang and other places last year, which cannot be recovered, and the person in charge of the bank has also lost about 30,000 yuan, so it has officially announced the cessation of business and liquidation. Deposits will be refunded in advance. Also, Renhe Pig Trading Company, which has been operating in Jianggan for more than ten years with annual turnover of about 200,000 to 300,000, has also announced its closure because it was owed more than 20,000 yuan by bankrupt butchers and was unable to sustain operations. It may be reorganized and operated by shareholders who invest more capital.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>The Qiantang River Rises and the Dike is in Danger</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, it has been raining continuously. Mountain floods in the You, Jinqu, and Yan areas of the Qiantang River have broken out, causing the water level of the Qiantang River to rise sharply. Recently, the water standard point of the Sanlang Temple in the Qiantang River has risen to 3.95 meters. Goods from all parts of the upper river are drifting along the water. In the eastern countryside and the Ximu Township of the fifth and seventh districts of Xiaoshan County, more than one million mu of newly grown sandbanks have been collapsing day and night due to the rapid flow of the river, and the situation is quite fierce. The dike bank suddenly appears to be in danger. The dike body in the fifth and sixth districts along the Qiantang River on the north bank is also in imminent danger. The Hangzhou Sand Protection Association has sent a letter to the district chiefs of the fifth and sixth districts to investigate and assist, and to supervise the strong men to plan the emergency rescue. Mayor Zhou Xiangxian also personally went to inspect the dike bank, and convened gentry and the district chiefs of the fifth and sixth districts to discuss emergency rescue matters.</p>

<h3>The New Eurasia Aircraft Arrives Today</h3>

<p>The new three-engine large aircraft Ju52aluc purchased by the Eurasia Aviation Company from the German Junkers Aircraft Factory was flown to China by the German pilot Raffiki on the 2nd of this month.

It will fly directly north this morning and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around 1:00 PM and land at Longhua Airport. After receiving confirmation of the arrival in Shanghai today, the company will immediately notify people from the Chinese and German communities in the city to welcome the aircraft. The aircraft is identical to the one purchased last year. Due to the development of air services in recent years, the company has extended the Ping-Zheng section to Hankou, and is gradually seeking to resume the full Ping-Yue line. In addition, the Ping-Bao Ning (Ningxia) section has added an up and down section each, resulting in an insufficient number of original aircraft for deployment, so the purchase was added for application.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu's 50th Birthday Acknowledgment</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the 9th of this month was Mayor Wu Tiecheng's 50th birthday. All sectors of the city felt that Wu had been the mayor of Shanghai for five years and had experienced countless dangers and difficulties, and had made many contributions to culture, economy, and society, and planned to hold a celebration on that day to express their respect. However, Wu was humble and did not want to be extravagant, and repeatedly dissuaded them in advance, and even avoided going elsewhere on the day. However, many leaders from all sectors of the city and Wu's friends still went to Wu's residence to leave notes and pay their respects. Wu felt that their kindness was touching, so he drafted a letter of thanks in response. The original letter is excerpted as follows: The other day was Tiecheng's 50th birthday. Because the country is in difficulty and the people's livelihood is exhausted, I have spent half my life in vain and have made no achievements. Therefore, I have strictly warned my family in advance not to take any action, lest it disturb relatives and friends. However, I am grateful to the colleagues in the press and friends from all sides for their kind congratulations and excessive praise. In addition to feeling grateful, I only increase my sense of guilt. Tiecheng serves the party and the country and is a public servant. I have little talent and am ashamed to have made no contribution. However, I am fortunate not to have failed, thanks to the guidance of the party and the government and our leaders, as well as the guidance of people from all walks of life and the assistance of my colleagues. If there is any honor, it should be attributed to the country and the leaders. The ancients said, "At the age of fifty, one knows the faults of the forty-nine years." From now on, Tiecheng can only work harder and hope to contribute a little, so as not to disappoint the expectations of all circles.</p>

Therefore, he was sent to Japan to inspect the museum affairs of that country in order to draw lessons. This trip will take about three weeks, and he plans to return home in early next month. At that time, he will report the inspection to the competent authorities for adoption.</p>

<h3>The Liangzhe Salt Affairs Tax Police Bureau Investigates Yuyao Private Boards</h3>
<p>Please Assist the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association</p>

It is stipulated that the number of boards will be investigated on March 15th, and our bureau is assigned to carry out the investigation. The factory bureau has the special responsibility of protecting taxes and suppressing smuggling. Since we have received the command of the Salt Transport, we cannot shirk it. However, this matter is of great importance, and at the beginning of the implementation, we are deeply afraid that various parties will misunderstand and cause disputes. We have attached a letter to the Salt Bureau notifying all salt farmers in the field and request that you examine it and widely publicize it. As for our bureau's implementation of the board inspection, we will definitely rectify the police discipline and proceed with caution. We hope that the salt merchants will understand everything and hope for the best. With this special message, we respectfully wish you good fortune." After receiving the letter, the Association has assisted in publicity to emphasize national taxes.</p>

<h3>International Trade Association Initiates Japanese Embassy Paper Weaving China Travel Association</h3>
<p>Aimed at attracting foreigners to travel in China, inviting presidents of various ministries and prominent figures from all walks of life to initiate.</p>
<p>The China International Trade Association, in order to attract people from various countries to travel in China, thereby increasing revenue from our country's tourism industry, offsetting trade deficits, spreading our country's culture, and promoting international understanding, is imitating the existing methods of European and American countries and Japan to initiate the organization of the China Travel Association. Yesterday, it sent letters to the presidents of various ministries and commissions, as well as the mayor of this city, Wu Tiecheng, and prominent figures from all walks of life, Yu Zhiqing, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Xinliu, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, etc., to be the initiators. After the association is established, it plans to jointly promote China's scenic spots abroad in conjunction with China Travel Service, various transportation agencies, companies, and businesses, and to improve travel facilities domestically and facilitate domestic travel.</p>
<p>Its declaration says: In recent years, China has suffered from the fluctuations of the world economic panic from the outside and the devastation of natural and man-made disasters from the inside. The outflow of silver, the exhaustion of finance, the cities have fallen into poverty, and the rural areas are on the verge of bankruptcy. The balance of international payments has been in deficit for many years, and the problem of trade deficits has become increasingly serious. The whole country, from top to bottom, almost universally wants to quickly extricate itself from the abyss of economic panic. Therefore, efforts are being made to adjust in various aspects. The government has implemented the reform of the monetary gold standard and promoted the construction of central and local areas. The people are also working diligently and urgently seeking the development of production industries to achieve self-sufficiency in various commodities, increase exports, and make up for trade deficits. This is indeed gratifying. However, looking at the efforts of all parties, most of them are biased towards increasing tangible trade in order to offset the deficit in the balance of international payments. Insufficient attention has been paid to intangible exports. As for</p>
<p>Intangible Exports The tourism industry is especially neglected by all parties. Attracting foreigners to travel in one's own country can not only allow foreigners to consume their daily necessities in one's own country, buy more of one's own country's products, and thus increase the income of the entire population of one's own country, but also allow foreigners to have a deeper understanding of one's own country's culture and customs, eliminate all misunderstandings and superficial views, and thus enhance friendship between countries. Its benefits are enormous. Therefore, in modern times, all countries regard the tourism industry as the most important enterprise of the country and do their best to promote it. Switzerland originally</p>
<p>Tourism Industry is the economic foundation of the country, advocating the most vigorously. France, Germany, the United States, Italy, and other countries are also catching up quickly. Canada, Cuba, Mexico, and the United States in the Americas have not had much time to read. Japan, India, and Vietnam in the East have also caught up, sparing no effort in promotion. Examining the methods of promotion in various countries, it is nothing more than the joint efforts of the government and the people, each with donations, uniting the railway, shipping, and hotel industries, striving to improve to suit the rich, and making widespread publicity and detailed guidance. Speaking of the results, the people who come to visit, supporting the old and carrying the young, scrambling forward for fear of falling behind, number in the thousands and tens of thousands. The income from this kind of business in various countries is</p>
<p>Counted in the Tens of Billions Not only is it enough to offset the deficit in the balance of international payments, but it can also prosper the economy of the entire nation. But try to ask the cost of its promotion, it is not worth a trace of the benefits obtained from the promotion. Our country has vast land, abundant products, and scenic spots everywhere. The palaces of Beiping and the lakes and mountains of Hangzhou have long been well-known. The holy land of Qufu, the ancient sites of Chang'an, the seaside of Qingdao, and the appearance of Mount Lu have also been praised by China and foreign countries. As for the landscape of Guilin, the climate of Kunming, the Buddhist forest of Mount Emei, and the waterfalls of Yandang, they have gradually attracted the attention of foreigners. The prosperity of Shanghai and the splendor of Guangzhou have long been in the minds of foreigners. Other things such as the long-standing culture and the simplicity of the people are also worthy of foreign research and understanding. Therefore, looking around the country, there is almost no place that cannot make foreigners</p>
<p>Linger and Forget to Return Also, there is nothing that cannot make foreigners spend money to buy. Based on this, the income that our country obtains from the tourism industry alone should be extremely huge. However, based on the past international balance of payments estimates, it can be known that the amount is very small. There is no way to compare it with Western countries. Even compared to India and Japan in the East, it is inferior. The reason for this is that our country's government and people have not been able to actively promote it. Examining the key elements for the development of the tourism industry, in addition to the beautiful natural environment, it should be the convenience of transportation facilities, the comfort of hotel arrangements, the courteous service of servants, the uniformity of national product prices, and the widespread official transmission abroad and the guidance of groups. In our country, all these things are either still in need of improvement, or they are</p>
<p>All Need Creation However, without a central organization to make detailed plans and provide unified command, both improvement and creation will be impossible to start. Governments and people in advanced countries almost all have this kind of organization, such as the Japan Tourism Bureau, the Swiss National Tourist Office, the German Tourism Promotion Association, and the Italian National Tourism Department. Although the names are different, the nature is the same. We are deeply aware of the profound economic panic and the backwardness of our country's tourism industry, and we are impressed by the effectiveness of the promotion of the tourism industry in various countries. Therefore, we have organized the Tourism Association, hoping to bring together various institutions related to the national tourism industry and Chinese and foreign people who have a special interest in the tourism industry,</p>
<p>United and Consistent Working together to improve domestic facilities and promote and guide abroad, etc., and hoping that women who come to our country to visit will feel convenient and comfortable in any aspect. Furthermore, we hope that the number of visitors will increase day by day, so that the people can obtain huge incomes, the national conditions can be accurately understood, the feelings between China and foreign countries can become more harmonious, and our country's international status and economic situation can also be increased and improved by this. After the organization of this association is completed, it is also planned to promote the travel of Chinese people at home and abroad to the best of our ability.</p>
<p>Encourage Because the majority of our country's people still lack noble entertainment, and when they occasionally have leisure, they mostly indulge in improper enjoyment. The result is not only useless but also harmful. To correct this mistake, promoting travel is the best way. Traveling is enough to enable the people to change to a new environment and increase new spirit and new strength after being busy with work, and then engage in their careers. Moreover, if the people often travel in the country, the residents of the countryside can understand the prosperity of the cities, and the residents of the cities can deeply understand the simplicity of the countryside. When inspecting the border towns and visiting scenic spots and historical sites, they can understand the long history, profound culture, and great construction of our country, and thus increase their</p>
<p>Love for the Motherland Enthusiasm, in visiting various industrial and commercial organizations, political academics, and social institutions, can also recognize the reality of our country in all aspects, and thus increase the knowledge that is necessary for them. This is extremely beneficial to the people themselves and the future of the country. As for letting the people travel abroad, the stones from other mountains can be used to polish jade. Our country is undergoing modernization in the process. There are many things that we want to learn from advanced countries. If the people have gained something abroad, they will be able to improve their careers after returning to the country, and the country will actually benefit from it. In short, the promotion of the tourism industry is necessary in today's China. Whether foreigners come to China to travel, Chinese people go abroad to travel, or Chinese people travel in the country, it is all beneficial and harmless to our country. We are deeply convinced of the extreme value of this kind of work, and we dare to jointly initiate it and work hard to achieve something. We hereby declare, hoping that our fellow countrymen will jointly plan for it.</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony of the Military Attaché Office of the Japanese Embassy</h3>
<p>Military Attaché Kita Presides Over Everything</p>
<p>The Japanese Embassy in China has built a military attaché office at the intersection of Tihui Road and Qicha Road. Construction began in September last year and has been completed. Yesterday afternoon, the opening ceremony was held in the new building. Military attachés stationed in various places such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao came to Shanghai a few days ago to participate. Military Attaché Kita presided over everything and invited Chinese and foreign people from this port to participate. As for the rumors that the Japanese military attaché will hold a meeting in Shanghai, the representative of the information office of the Japanese Embassy claimed that it was a misrepresentation. There is currently no preparation to convene a meeting. However, when military attachés from various places gathered in Shanghai to meet Military Attaché Kita, they would naturally report the situation in various places. Military attachés from various places will stay in Shanghai for a while and then return to their respective posts.</p>
<h3>San Francisco Immigration Commissioner Cahill Describes the Reasons for American Resistance to Chinese Labor</h3>
<p>Preventing and Reducing Wages in the US; Difficult for Quota Movement to Pass</p>
<p>The mainland newspaper reported that Mr. Cahill, the San Francisco District Immigration Commissioner who also handles naturalization matters, and his wife returned to San Francisco from the Philippines on the President Hoover. When they passed through Shanghai on Tuesday, they talked to a reporter from the mainland newspaper about the reasons why American laborers are striving to maintain the current immigration laws that exclude Chinese people from entering the country, saying that American laborers are deeply afraid that the entry of low-value workers will reduce their wages. Therefore, they have tried their best to resist Eastern immigrants from entering the United States in the past. There are also quotas for European immigrants entering the United States. In recent years, due to the economic downturn, laborers have struggled to maintain their wages in order to avoid further reductions, and they are working harder than before. Their organizations are also more complete, so that the wages they earn are enough to purchase daily necessities. In addition, laborers are all worried about unemployment. There are still as many as 9 million unemployed people in the United States, and 1 million young people graduate from school every year to seek employment. These two reasons have made the American labor resistance line more consolidated. Although the number of Europeans and non-Europeans allowed to enter the United States is limited to 154,000 people per year, only 32,000 people were allowed to enter last year. The number of people who can enter this year is approximately only 16,000 people. All others who apply for entry are rejected due to the strict regulations promulgated by the State Council, because of various reasons for verifying physical fitness and financial resources. Now, every immigrant must hold approximately 1,700 US dollars before they are eligible to enter the country. When the reporter asked if there was any hope for setting a quota for Eastern immigrants, Mr. Cahill replied that he heard that some people are now campaigning for this matter. The current Congress may propose this matter, but because the labor party strongly opposes it, there is little hope for this kind of bill to pass. I would like to express my gratitude for the good spirit of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have no complaints about the measures taken by the immigration officials to implement the law. They know that they can only do their duties in a reasonable way and have no right to change the law.</p>

<h3>Crew of Ning Shao Company Opposes Salary Reduction</h3>
<p>Shipping Engineers Association and others submit requests for assistance from party and government agencies.</p>
<p>The entire crew of the Ning Shao Commercial Shipping Company opposed the salary reduction of the crew of the Ning Jing Wheel. They sent separate letters to the driving and maritime workers' union and the shipping engineers' association, etc., to quickly negotiate with the capitalists and demand the immediate restoration of the original salaries of all the crew of the Ning Jing Wheel. The association, etc., in order to protect the interests of its members, seek the happiness of its members, and hope that labor and capital will cooperate sincerely, hopes that the capitalists will immediately realize this in order to avoid unfortunate twists and turns. Therefore, it has submitted a request to the party and government authorities to strictly prevent salary reduction behavior, immediately restore the original salaries, and earnestly protect the positions of the crew members and not make any changes without reason.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Checks Smokers</h3>
<p>Those Who Have Relapsed After Quitting Will Be Punished According to Law</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, in order to prevent smokers from relapsing after quitting and to completely eliminate opium addiction, the Municipal Police Bureau has specially stipulated that the first batch of 2,000 smokers who have quit smoking will be selected for random checks, and entrusted the Longhua Temporary Drug Rehabilitation Center and the Zhabei Opium Addiction Hospital to conduct the checks. Since the beginning of this month, the Municipal Police Bureau has ordered various branches and districts to notify smokers, and they have been going to respond to the checks in crowded numbers in recent days. The second round is scheduled to begin at the beginning of next month, and more than 18,000 smokers who have registered to quit will be checked one by one.</p>
<p>Punishing Relapsed Smokers According to Chief Ye of the Registration Section of the Fourth Division of the Bureau, the purpose of the Bureau's handling of random checks of smokers is to prevent the abuse of those who have quit and have relapsed. The hospitals responsible for the random checks will report the results of the smokers' random checks to the Bureau every day. If it is found that any smokers who have quit have relapsed, the Bureau will punish them in accordance with the Provisional Bamboo Regulations for Punishing Opium Addiction promulgated by the Military Commission, and will never condone them.</p>
<p>Implementing Joint Liability Since the implementation of the city's anti-opium work, propaganda and persuasion have been carried out simultaneously. Although the situation is complicated, it is no more than a city where Chinese and foreigners live together, and the results are very significant. However, in order to eliminate opium addicts and drug offenders within the time limit, the joint liability system has been implemented. If an unlicensed opium addict is found to be residing in the urban area and the landlord conceals it and does not report it, once arrested, the landlord will be punished in the same way as the opium addict.</p>

The following is a record of the Reserve Association's business report and the Acceptance House's business report.</p>
<p>Business Report of the Reserve Association</p>
<p>The Joint Reserve Committee's 1936 Business Report stated: Politics and economics are closely related. This year's situation, such as Sino-Japanese diplomacy and the Xi'an Incident, was sufficient to affect finance. Fortunately, the panic of "lack of chips" in the past has now been eliminated, so we are safe and sound. If it had occurred before the implementation of the new monetary policy, the degree of tension would have been higher than today. Rumors of capital flight often deafened the ears. However, although the price of gold and foreign currencies was occasionally high, it soon returned to stability due to the strict management of the National Bank. Other factors, such as the abundance of agricultural products, the rebound in prices, the increase in industrial and commercial production, and the reduction in international import surpluses, as demonstrated by the facts and reflected in reports from various parties, are now sufficient to prove the progress of the national economy. Although its reflection in the Shanghai financial community is not yet significant, real estate transactions, which account for an important part of investment, remain stagnant. However, it can be asserted that the general market situation has shown signs of turning, and the increase in the Association's exchange volume is one proof of this. Our colleagues in the industry operate prudently, each consolidating their foundation, allowing the market to begin calmly and then become lively. Their painstaking efforts are conceivable. At the beginning of this year, the Association, in view of the urgent need to promote bill acceptance and spot cash, established the Bank Acceptance House to handle the acceptance and discounting of bills of exchange, so that industry funds can be used flexibly. In the past five years, the Association has taken the lead in joint reserves, the planning and establishment of the Clearing House, and gradual promotion, relying on the supervision of colleagues in the industry and responding to the needs of the times. All planned projects have been gradually implemented and have achieved results. This is somewhat comforting to our colleagues in the industry. In the future, how should the Association adapt to the environment and needs, improve efficiency, and strive to fulfill its service responsibilities? We still hope that our colleagues in the industry will provide guidance at any time so that we may have something to follow, and we are infinitely hopeful. At the end of 1936, in addition to the Bank Acceptance House providing a separate report in accordance with regulations, we hereby report the main points of the business situation over the past year as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Department of Joint Reserves: (1) Reserve Assets: The total number of reserve assets deposited by each bank, according to the year-end financial statement, is 60,001,338.90 national currency, which is slightly lower than the number at the end of the previous year. This is because the market price of real estate in the reserve assets has changed slightly. This year, the evaluation committee re-evaluated strictly, so the numbers are difficult to see a reduction, and the content is more factual. The total amount of all reserves was 59.98% of the total evaluation amount in the first half of the year and 60.91% of the total evaluation amount in the second half of the year. According to the number of the financial statement in the second half of the year, real estate accounts for 82% of the total amount, foreign marketable securities account for 11.75%, domestic government bonds account for 5%, and cash accounts for 0.25%. (2) Promissory Notes and Call Loans: In addition to being used as various reserves, the promissory notes received by each bank, including the public promissory notes, can be used to offset call loans or remit funds to the Association. The total amount of public promissory note call loans in the first half of the year was 44,454,000 national currency, which is an increase of 24,260,000 yuan compared to the first half of 1935. The total amount of public promissory note call loans in the second half of the year was 56,670,000 national currency, which is a decrease of 51,360,000 yuan compared to the second half of 1935. The trend of decreasing public promissory note call loans is because the Association's Bank Acceptance House was established in March of this year, and each bank has the convenience of accepting and discounting bills of exchange. The original public promissory note call loans are now partly converted into bill of exchange acceptance and discounting. After the implementation of the new monetary policy, the chips are abundant, the finance is loose, and the need for call loans is also reduced. The Association's public promissory note call loan interest rate is usually 10% per annum, and the call loan interest rate is usually around 8%, with very little change, which proves the stability of the market. (3) Acceptance Bill Discount: Each bank holds bills of exchange accepted by the Association's Bank Acceptance House, which can be discounted at any time to the member banks of the Acceptance House or the Association. Among colleagues, funds can have appropriate turnover. During the year, the total discount of acceptance bills by the Association was 4,660,000 national currency. At the end of the year, the amount that had not yet expired was 2,530,000 national currency. The Association's acceptance bill discount rate, based on 90-day bills, averaged 11.19% per annum. (4) Clearing Deposits: The average daily amount of clearing bank deposits this year was 95,914,000 national currency, which is an increase of more than 11,790,000 yuan compared to the average daily amount of the previous year. The total year-end deposit balance was more than 98,849,000 yuan, of which clearing deposits accounted for 39.68% and remittance deposits accounted for 60.32%. The ratio of clearing differences to clearing deposits averaged 1/6. (5) Profit and Loss: The total revenue from loan interest for the year was 200,896.15 yuan, plus 37,240.98 yuan from call loan interest, discount interest, and other income, totaling 246,208.13 yuan. The budget for the expenses of the Reserve Department this year was 24,720 yuan, and the financial statement was 25,674.62 yuan, which exceeded the budget by 954.62 yuan. After deducting the total amortization of equipment of 8,017.76 yuan, the net profit after offsetting profit and loss was 212,515.75 yuan.</p>
<p>(B) Department of Bill Exchange: (1) Exchange Banks: Because the seats in the Exchange House were full, the Association was temporarily unable to arrange for banks applying to join the exchange this year. The Executive Committee specially stipulated that member banks of the Bankers Association who are unable to join as exchange banks due to the limited location of the Exchange House may entrust the Association to act as an agent for exchange and collection of bills. In January of this year, six banks, including Zhejiang Local, Sichuan Meifeng, Jiangsu Provincial Farmers, China Farmers, Yongda, and Pudong, successively entrusted the Association to act as an agent for exchange and collection of bills. On January 28, the Central Bank joined the Association as a Yuanhao exchange bank. From the same day, the collection and settlement of the Association's exchange bank customers were handled jointly by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, and a joint office of the Central, China, and Communications Banks was established in the Association. On September 1, the Sichuan-Kang Colonial Bank and the Agricultural and Commercial Bank simultaneously entrusted the Association to act as an agent for exchange and collection of bills. On November 2, the Zhonghui and Jiangzhe banks in the Association's exchange banks merged their operations, and the exchange house number of Jiangzhe Bank was eliminated due to the merger. On December 1, the China Farmers Bank changed from a trust agent exchange bank to an exchange bank to fill the vacancy of Jiangzhe Bank. In addition, eleven branches of each bank established in the city successively joined the exchange this year. (2) Exchange Volume: The total exchange volume for the year was 5,984,300,080.71 national currency, with 2,578,913 bills. Compared with the previous year, the amount increased by 61.05% and the bills increased by 38.71%. The increase in the exchange volume this year can be attributed to the joining of the Central Bank in the exchange and the expansion of the Association's agency exchange scope. The average daily exchange volume was 20,149,000 national currency, with 8,683 bills. On February 31, the exchange amount reached 195,253,052.31 yuan, and on April 14, the exchange bills reached 24,261, both of which were the highest records since the exchange was held. Comparing the monthly amounts, the daily average in May was more than 16 million yuan, March and August were both more than 17 million yuan, February, April, July, and September were all more than 18 million yuan, January and November were both more than 12 million yuan, and October and December averaged more than 24 million yuan per day. The ratio of the annual exchange difference to the total exchange amount, calculated by combining clearing and remittance, averaged 11.67%, a decrease of 1.69% from the previous year. (3) Collection of Bills: Since the Association started handling the collection of bills in mid-June of the previous year, after several months of training, all procedures have become proficient by the beginning of this year, and the service efficiency has become more significant. The total number of collections this year was 1,455,457,124.06 yuan, with 1,242,703 bills, averaging 4,111,000 yuan and 3,511 bills per day. On December 31, the collection amount reached 14,169,836.73 yuan, which was the highest record this year. On October 1, the collection of bills reached 10,880, which was the highest record since the collection was handled. In the total amount of collections throughout the year, remittance and money house payable funds accounted for 57.68% of the total amount, silver and money industry payable funds outside the Bankers Association accounted for 23.56%, and various shops or merchants outside the silver and money industry accounted for 18.76%. As for the money industry's receipt of bills from the Association's exchange banks, with each bank issuing checks to the Association, and the Central, China, and Communications Banks reconciling accounts with the money industry's reserve bank, the total number for the year was 1,376,499,938.28 yuan, averaging 3,888,000 yuan per day. (4) Statistics on Returned Checks: The total number of returned checks after exchange this year was 90,792, averaging 306 returned checks per day, accounting for 3.54% of the average daily exchange bills, a decrease of 1.3% compared to the percentage from September to December of the previous year. (Exchange and Collection Expenses: The budget for the exchange portion of the expenses this year was 51,960 yuan, and the financial statement was 53,709.60 yuan, which exceeded the budget by 1,749.60 yuan. Calculated according to the total exchange receipts and payments for the year, it costs about 4.5 cents for every 1,000 yuan of exchange bills, which is a decrease of 1.7 cents from the previous year. The budget for the collection portion of the expenses this year was 67,320 yuan, and the financial statement was 68,969.18 yuan, which exceeded the budget by 1,649.18 yuan. Calculated according to the total amount of collections for the year, it costs about 4.74 cents for every 1,000 yuan of collection bills, which is an increase of 2.2 cents from the previous year. In order to avoid burdening the banks, it is planned to pay it from the Association's net profit.</p>
<p>Acceptance House Report</p>
<p>The Bank Acceptance House's 1936 Business Report stated: The backbone of the modern financial market is bill acceptance and discount. The history of our country's modern financial organization is relatively shallow. Shanghai is the financial center of the country, but acceptance bills and other borrowing tools have not yet taken root. Banks mostly provide funds to industry and commerce in the form of mortgage loans. Before the due date, this type of mortgage loan cannot be circulated through discounting. Once there is a financial crunch, there is no room for turnover and financing of sluggish book debts. As a result, bank funds sometimes feel lacking. In the past few years, due to the concentration of funds in urban areas, financial relaxation, and loose market conditions, since 1935, the abnormal prosperity has turned into frank embarrassment. In June of that year, the market was extremely tight, which was unprecedented. Our colleagues in the industry usually operate steadily. Although the difficult times have passed, and they are breathing a little easier, in order to seek development for themselves and to plan for the revitalization of the market, they entrusted the Association to plan the establishment of a bill acceptance house. At that time, a committee was organized to start discussing methods. After several months and five or six meetings, various rules and regulations were drafted, but they were delayed until the end of the year due to obstacles and were not implemented. At the beginning of this year, the financial stagnation was still the same as before. Colleagues deeply felt that the promotion of acceptance bills should not be delayed any longer, so they re-studied and decided to set up a Bank Acceptance House in the Association, with the scope of serving colleagues. On February 20, the 14th Committee Bank Representatives Meeting passed the articles of association and covenant drafts, and sent them to the Bankers Association for approval and filing. At the same time, the Executive Committee actively prepared for the signing of contracts, the raising of funds, the completion of various detailed rules, and the arrangement of venues and the allocation of personnel. The preparations were completed on March 16, and an announcement was made on the same day to establish and start work. A total of 38 member banks joined, paying up a total of 7,613,750 national currency in acceptance funds, of which 5% was deposited in cash in the House, and the remaining 95% was deposited in the original paying bank, agreeing that the total amount of acceptance was 30,495,000 national currency. Afterwards, each bank successively deposited acceptance collateral in the House. By the beginning of April, each bank had begun to sell and hand over to the House for acceptance, and discount transactions were implemented among colleagues. As of the end of the year, the various businesses were proceeding smoothly. The Association aims to serve the industry, and the acceptance of bank bills is intended to make the funds of colleagues flexible. Since there are no previous rules in the country, all facilities are created from scratch, and expansion and improvement are still to come. We sincerely hope that our colleagues in the industry will not hesitate to give guidance, so that the House can provide soil and fine streams in the development process of each colleague, and then we will be grateful. At the end of 1936, we hereby report the main points of the business situation over the past year as follows: (1) Acceptance Collateral: The total amount of acceptance collateral deposited by each bank, according to the year-end financial statement, is 3,867,368 national currency. The acceptance amount accounts for 71.34% of the total evaluation amount of the collateral. According to the year-end financial statement, marketable government bonds, company bonds, bills, and stocks account for 50.01% of the total amount, real estate in the city accounts for 20.71%, domestic commercial paper accounts for 18.2%, the Association's promissory notes account for 6.48%, and domestic goods account for 4.69%. (2) Acceptance Bills: The total number of bills issued by each bank and accepted by the House during the year was 84, totaling 4,020,000 national currency. The number of acceptance bills of the House that have expired this year is 27, totaling 1,340,000 national currency. The number of bills that have not yet expired at the end of the year is 57, totaling 1,680,000 national currency. The average term of the bills is mostly 90 days. The acceptance amount is delivered to the House by the issuing bank one day before the bill expires. There were no expired bills extended throughout the year. (3) Discount Transactions: The sale and purchase of acceptance bills of the House are temporarily limited to member banks. The House acts as an agent for contact every day. If there is a sale but no purchase on the same day, the Association may discount it, and then sell it again when needed. The total number of discount transactions of acceptance bills of the House this year was 6,710,000 national currency, of which 4,660,000 yuan was discounted by the Association, and 2,050,000 yuan was discounted by each member bank. The acceptance bill discount rate, based on 90-day bills, averaged 11.9% per annum. (4) Profit and Loss: From March to December of this year, the income from acceptance handling fees and interest totaled 8,327.15 yuan. The budget for the expenses of the acceptance portion of the year, calculated from March to the end of the year, was 8,000 yuan for ten months. The financial statement was 5,007.69 yuan, which was 2,992.11 yuan less than the budget. After deducting the total amount of start-up costs of 1,908.14 yuan, the net profit after offsetting profit and loss was 1,411.32 national currency, which is planned to be fully included in the surplus for rollover.</p>
<h3>Tajiri Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Went to Beijing the same night to visit Kawagoe</p>
<p>Tajiri, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy in China, returned to Japan last month on behalf of Ambassador Kawagoe to make a request. The matter has been completed. He returned to Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru at 3:00 PM yesterday. After disembarking, he went to the Consulate General to visit Consul General Kawase. That night, he took the night express train to Beijing to visit Ambassador Kawagoe and report on the trip.</p>
<h3>The Lawyers Association Suggests Improving the Judiciary</h3>
<p>Vigorously Implement Oral Petitions, Quickly Handle Preservation Measures, and Deliberate on the Amount of Guarantee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association submitted a document to the Jiangsu High Court and the courts at all levels in the region where its members practice law, stating that it was a request. It stated that Article 426 of the Civil Procedure Law stipulates that a lawsuit, a request for mediation, and statements or representations outside the date of the hearing may be made orally. Last year's judicial conference also resolved to adopt the proposal that oral prosecution should be vigorously implemented in civil simple cases, and the Ministry of Justice adopted it. Subsequently, the Ministry of Justice issued Instruction No. 6137, ordering the courts under its jurisdiction to earnestly implement it. At present, the above-mentioned methods have not been implemented in the Shanghai courts, and the parties to the lawsuit feel inconvenienced. It seems that the local courts should be requested to implement them quickly and announce detailed methods for oral petitions and lawsuits. Secondly, the lack of provisions for provisional attachment and provisional injunction in civil cases is intended to preserve the creditor's compulsory execution. Therefore, the most important thing in handling such cases is speed. If the handling is slightly delayed, the debtor will have already escaped after hearing the news, or has already disposed of or concealed the property, so that the creditor's claim cannot be preserved, which violates the original purpose of the preservation procedure. At present, the Shanghai courts have failed to handle such cases quickly, so it should be requested to formulate effective and prompt methods. A deadline should be clearly set for matters such as copying and delivery, in order to be fast and achieve the purpose of the preservation procedure. In addition, regarding provisional attachment and provisional injunction cases, the court clearly orders the creditor to provide security. The amount of security should be determined by the court in accordance with its authority. However, the court does not consider whether the debtor has any actual possibility of damage. For example, in a rent case, the landlord applies for provisional attachment in order to avoid the tenant escaping the rent, and the number of securities ordered to be provided is often equal to the object of the request. This is nothing more than to protect the interests of the tenant in the court, but for the landlord, the claim has already been in danger, and he must provide a huge amount of security, and in fact, he is overwhelmed. It seems that the Junyuan should be requested to consider the actual situation, take into account the interests of both parties, etc. The meeting was submitted to the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, and it was resolved that it should be forwarded to the courts for adoption, etc. In addition to submitting it separately, it is urgently submitted to the Junyuan for review and adoption, which is convenient for the public.</p>

However, it was not carried out due to the need to complete the filing procedures. Now the association has appointed Xu Guanqun, Sun Daosheng, Xu Jianruo, Xu Yunhui, and others to handle the filing matters.

<h3>American Female Explorer Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Cleese Makris Licks Her Life's Adventures, Now Retired from Exploration for Leisure</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that Mrs. Cleese Makris, an English woman, began traveling and exploring after the death of her husband, Mr. Kirk, fourteen years ago. There is no place she has not been to. Her travel books, written under the name of Mrs. Cleese Makris, have been read by millions of readers. Later, she married Mr. Fischer, so she is now renamed Mrs. Fischer. Mr. Fischer also likes to travel very much. Recently, the couple traveled together, passing through Mandalay, Burma, Yunnan, India, and now they have arrived in Shanghai. According to Mrs. Fischer, who told the Continental News reporter that she has retired from exploration and is now traveling for leisure. She and her husband travel to foreign countries every year. The most recent trip took forty days, sometimes by boat, sometimes on foot, sometimes with a mule train, and sometimes flying in an airplane. After a short stay in Shanghai, they plan to return to London via Moscow and plan the itinerary for next year's trip. Mrs. Fischer also mentioned the dangers she encountered during her travels, saying, "I was attacked by wolves in Western Siberia, and I was once trapped in a glacier. The situation was very difficult. I have several bullet and arrow scars on my body. The one on my nose was received in the Azalea Desert. I also have a knife wound on my waist. Several years ago, every time I went to South America, there was a revolution there. But when people are in danger, they are calm. Every time I go to a place, I am not discouraged by the dangers. I remember once when I wanted to enter Russia, I couldn't because there were soldiers patrolling the border. So I entered the Arctic region, hired four Lapps from Lapland as guides, and traveled by reindeer sled for sixty-seven days before finally entering Russia. The most dangerous of my travels was contracting tropical fever in the Amazon River in South America. The reason was partly because I had to climb the Andes Mountains, which were 17,000 feet high, so I reduced the weight of the food I carried, which made the situation weak, and partly because the Czech youth who was traveling with me shot himself in the head with a pistol and died, which was caused by shock. Before the Italian-Ethiopian War was about to break out, I traveled to Addis Ababa and dined with the Ethiopian Emperor. Then, escorted by an Ethiopian guard, I traveled 1,200 miles by freight car to enter British Kenya. I have traveled from Cairo, Egypt, to the Cape of Good Hope, and I have also hunted in the Rocky Mountains of the United States and the Himalayas, and I have also entered Tibet with merchant caravans. I have visited almost all the historical sites in various countries that you can mention." ×××</p>

<h3>Song Amao Stabbed to Death for Only Three Yuan and Fifty Cents</h3>
<p>The Murderer Confessed to the Murder After Failing to Recover Debt. The Police Filed a Public Prosecution for Murder</p>
<p>Song Amao, a 34-year-old man from Ningbo, used to be a carpenter and recently worked as a vendor. He and his wife, Song Zhang氏, lived in the Fulaike Inn at No. 43 Mantingfang, Wuhu Road. Unfortunately, at around 1 p.m. the day before yesterday, he had a dispute with his friend Wang Rongzhang over money, which led to a feud. Wang then used a sharp blade to stab Song six times at the entrance of the inn, including one in the left breast, sternum, left ribs, left arm, right shoulder, and left thigh. Wang did not escape and was immediately seized by Song's wife, Zhang, and handed over to the patrol officer, who took him to the Laozha Police Station under its jurisdiction. Song was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment but was ineffective. He died at 2:30 p.m. Detective Zhang Yi went to investigate and took the body to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road to await examination. Yesterday morning, the police sent Wang to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the case and filed a prosecution for murder, stating that the autopsy was still pending, so all evidence could not be submitted and requested an extension. Judge Qian Hongye briefly questioned the defendants and approved the postponement for further review. At around 10 a.m., Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the Prosecutor's Office of the Special District One Court, together with two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and a clerk, arrived at the Forensic Examination Office. At the same time, the police also transferred the defendants to the office. After Zhang examined the body, Wang Rongzhang was interrogated and confessed that he was 35 years old, a local, and lived at No. 15 Tongchunfang, Dongxinqiao. He worked as a shadow puppeteer. The deceased owed him three yuan and fifty cents in national currency and refused to pay it back. The night before, he beat me. Yesterday, I was drunk and borrowed a fruit knife. I first fought with the deceased, and because I was no match for him, I stabbed him with the knife. The rest of the confession was evasive. According to Song Zhang's投称, the death of the deceased Song Amao, male, was indeed caused by being stabbed to death by a knife while alive. The body was handed over to his wife, Song Zhang, for burial. The criminal, Wang Rongzhang, has been prosecuted by the police and is awaiting a court verdict.</p>

<h3>Zhang Wenbin Accused of Extortion and Fraud, Trial Concluded</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenbin, an investigator hired by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, in September of the 23rd year of the Republic, when he was under Captain Yu's command, falsely accused Yang Baoshan, who lived at No. 4 Xingye Lane, Bailinan Road, of smoking opium and took him to the Investigation Team. He then used non-criminal intimidation by pouring tap water into his mouth and nose and extorted 20 yuan from Yang Shi山 before releasing him. Yang endured it without saying anything. On April 12, 25th year of the Republic, he and the escaped detectives Xiao Huaibaozi and Du Sanhua went to Yang Baoshan's home to search for smoking paraphernalia, thinking that they could extort him again. Yang Baoshan, feeling that things were different now than they were before, reported it to the police, who arrested Zhang Wenbin and sent him to the Songhu Garrison Command for investigation. The case was determined to be an ordinary criminal case and did not involve military matters, so it was transferred to the local court, where prosecutor Tang Ruxiu opened a trial for investigation, summoning witness Sun Shouqing to testify that the 20 yuan was transferred to Zhang's hand, thus clarifying the case. He then filed a public prosecution for the crime under Article 346, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Yu opened a trial, and the defendant's lawyer, Gu Jichang, appeared in court to defend him. The defendant claimed in his own defense that he had arrested people for opium before, so he was falsely accused out of resentment, and that the search of his home was only based on his statement and had no evidence. The court debate concluded and the verdict will be announced on the 16th.</p>

<p>Zheng He, the Three Treasure Eunuch of the Zhu Ming Dynasty, led the fleet seven times to the Western Seas during the Yongle and Xuande reigns, laying the foundation for the migration of millions of overseas Chinese to Southeast Asia today. Zheng He managed more than 30 countries and his footprints extended to the east coast of Africa. He is not only a great man of China but also one of the world's greatest navigators. In recent years, Chinese and Western scholars have written extensively on him. However, because the Ming History and the notes written by people at that time only focus on the voyages to the Western Seas and there is no information about Zheng He's family, hometown, nature, and descendants, modern research is rich in quantity but cannot escape its scope. Zheng He was a Hui Muslim from Kunyang County, Yunnan. His descendants are in Shigoutou Village, Yuxi County, adjacent to Kunyang. Recently, General Li Yiting of Yuxi discovered his family's secretly hidden family tree. Mr. Li Shihou of Ludian explained it in detail and wrote a book, "A Study of Zheng He's Family Tree." The original family tree provides detailed records of Zheng He's hometown, background, nature, and descendants, and the study provides thorough explanations without omission. It also provides many corrections to the errors in historical records regarding the voyages to the Western Seas. It is expected to arouse great interest in academic circles. This book is currently sold by the Zhengzhong Bookstore on Xihua Street, Yunnan. Each copy costs one dime in national currency. For mail orders from other places, no extra postage is charged, and postage stamps are fully accepted.</p>
<h3>Hunan Woman Luo Xi Sues He Kangli for Obscenity and is Sentenced</h3>
<p>Six months imprisonment suspended for two years</p>
<p>Luo Xi, a 17-year-old woman from Hunan, was orphaned at a young age and fostered in the Wei family, so she is also known as Wei Xuezhen. Because her foster father engaged in misconduct towards her, she resolutely came to Shanghai with her classmate Xu Zuomin to study in August last year. She currently resides at No. 318 Qinle Village, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. On the morning of October 19 last year, she went to her fellow villager He Kangli's place at No. 16 Xuehuafang, Avenue Edward VII, to borrow a bed board and was forcibly raped by He. This happened several times thereafter. He promised to marry Luo, but after several liaisons, Luo became pregnant. When she urged He to hold the engagement ceremony, He proposed absurd conditions: first, Luo would commit suicide with him in Pudong; second, Luo would commit adultery with Liu Binru, a fellow villager living with her, in order to place the responsibility for the child on Liu in the future. Luo had no choice but to accept the first condition and had intercourse with Liu. Later, Liu discovered He's secret and invited his fellow villagers to a banquet to announce He's scheme. He was enraged and abandoned Luo. Luo had no choice but to report to the French police. He had already heard the news and fled to Nanjing. He secretly returned to Shanghai in the middle of last month and was discovered by Luo, who reported to the French police again. The detectives arrested He and sent him to the Special Second Court, where the lawyer of the Police Department filed a public prosecution for rape of a woman under the age of sixteen and obstruction of morality. The plaintiff, Luo Xi, also hired a lawyer to file an incidental civil suit, requesting compensation for living expenses (at 40 yuan per month until the age of 50) and losses such as dowry money, totaling 20,200 yuan. Judge Liao Yan opened court several times to summon witnesses and conduct investigations. The defendant also hired a lawyer to defend him. The case was declared closed, and a date was set for sentencing, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the date for sentencing arrived. At 3:00 PM, Judge Liao ordered the defendant to be brought to the First Criminal Court. The plaintiff also appeared in court to await sentencing. After a brief inquiry into the defendant's age and place of origin, Judge Liao sentenced He Kangli to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years, for raping a woman under the age of sixteen. The incidental civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court.</p>

<h3>International Basketball Second Finals: China Defeats the United States</h3>
<p>45:32 Zhou Dayun's Luck Comes and He Scores 20 Points Alone; The Whole Team is Active and the Defense is Tight, and the Enemy's Momentum is Restrained</p>
<p>Russia Defeats Japan Again to Win the Group B Championship</p>
<p>Last night, the Chinese basketball team, with its extremely agile and lively posture, defeated the American team with a score of 45 to 32. Thus, the senior group championship of this year's international basketball tournament will have to be resolved in the third final on Saturday night. Although China lost the first game 34 to 44, it adopted an aggressive policy from the beginning last night, with great momentum. Except for a brief period in the first half when it was 14 to 16 behind, it led the way and put the United States in a difficult battle. Although Zhou Dayun's style of play hinders the cooperation of the whole team, his luck came last night, and every shot was a hit, scoring 20 points alone, which was the greatest contribution to China's victory, compensating for his mistakes in the first game. From this point of view, the success or failure of the Chinese team will depend on Zhou himself. Another reason for the victory is that all five players were able to fulfill their duties and closely monitor their opponents. Tall players such as Rock Klein were useless, and Carson had few opportunities to penetrate the basket. Comparatively speaking, Feng Nianhua was the most outstanding. In the Group B match, Russia defeated Japan again, 28 to 17, and the championship went to Russia. The scores of the China-US battle are as follows:</p>
<p>First Strike After the Japan-Russia game, China and the United States took the stage. China started with Feng, Yin, Kuang, Cai, and Wang. American Kinding was absent, and Borie, Rock, Klein, Paros, and Carson played. After the game started, China took the first strike and pounced on the enemy's stronghold with great vigor. Feng Nianhua registered first, and Cai Yanxiong added one point for Borie's foul. Then Cai snatched the ball under the basket and rushed out, achieving success again, with a score of 5 to 0 at the height of the moment. Feng Nianhua and others were active in drilling, and Wang and Cai's defense was tight, and the enemy's momentum was restrained. After five minutes, Kuang Yao Ya's foul allowed Borie to open the record for the United States.</p>
<p>Tense Period After Kuang Yaozhi registered two points, Locke suddenly performed his old tricks and scored two in the basket, making it 7 to 5. Cai Yanxiong was a sharpshooter, and Rock and Carson fought hard, tying the score at 9 to 9. China suspended the game, and Chen Zongqi replaced Cai Yanxiong to deal with Locke, which proved effective. Feng Nianhua and Wang Nanzhen added three points, and China was originally in the lead. Although Klein returned a goal, Kuang Yaozhi added another ball. After Rhein made a free throw, China replaced Kuang Yaozhi with Zhou Dayun. Locke threw a ball behind his back with one hand, suddenly surpassing China with 15 to 14. Carson added another point with a free throw, and the situation became more serious. Fortunately, everyone stepped up their defense and blocked the enemy's momentum. Feng Nianhua first tied the score at 16 to 16, and Zhou Dacheng followed with 18 to 16, winning two points for China. The first half ended.</p>
<p>Golden Age As the battle resumed, China replaced Yin Guiren with Han Zhenyuan, while the others were Feng, Zhou, Chen, and Wang. The United States remained the same. Rhein rushed straight into the basket and threw a ball from the outside of the boundary, which the referee did not see, resulting in a score of 18 to 18. Wang Nanzhen broke through the encirclement and dribbled the ball like a god, immediately scoring. Zhou Chen and Feng made three visits to the thatched cottage, leading by 25 to 18, with great momentum. The United States called a timeout, and Paros was replaced by Fost. At this time, China was in its prime, and the long legs of the United States lost their effectiveness. Although Carson was brave, he had no time for defense, let alone offense. Zhou Dayun's luck suddenly came, and he shot as soon as he got the ball, and every shot was a hit, scoring five goals in a short time, overwhelming the United States with 35 to 18. The momentum was so strong that it was invincible. From then on, China was worry-free.</p>
<p>Smooth Sailing A smooth road leads to all things. At this time, China was invincible. The center jump was also repeatedly seized by Feng Chen and others, further reducing the opponent's shooting opportunities. When there were opportunities, they often lost their targets due to overeagerness. Zhou Dayun's luck did not wane, and he continued to score five points, leading by 40 to 23, with a difference of 17 points, the largest difference. Later, Kuang Yaozhi replaced Zhou to rest, and at 43 to 27 when Feng Nianhua committed his fourth foul, he re-entered the field. At this time, China's victory was in hand, and the United States team was exhausted and had to admit defeat. The final result was 45 to 32.</p>
<p>Russia Wins Japan Starting at 7:00, Japan and Russia opened fire first. The Russian team, with its physical advantages, was quite smooth, and with high luck and accurate shooting, they took the lead in the first half with 17 to 4. After the break, Japan tried to retaliate, and although it led by one point with 12 to 11, the overall result was still 17 to 28, with Russia winning. The results are as follows:</p>

<h3>This Year's Elementary School Joint Games Adds Special Groups for Boys and Girls</h3>
<p>Hand-Thrown Distance and Tug-of-War Competitions</p>
<p>The Social Bureau Provides Separate Explanations</p>
<p>The ninth Municipal Social Bureau-sponsored Elementary School Joint Games, scheduled for next month, have been previously reported. When athletes from various districts register to participate in the joint games, each district must prepare a group photo of all athletes, and must mark the name and school name on each person. The girls' group A will add a 200-meter relay event. Male athletes weighing over 115 pounds and female athletes weighing 110 pounds or more will be classified as a special group and will use the same events as the male and female group A. The points they obtain will not be included in the military ranking calculation.</p>
<p>Explanation of Hand-Thrown Distance 1. The hand projectile weighs one and a half pounds. 2. The rules of the softball throwing distance competition are used. 3. The Lao Ximen Standard Company and the Ziqiang Sporting Goods Company both sell them.</p>
<p>Explanation of Tug-of-War Competition (1) Use a thick hemp rope with a diameter of two inches and a length of approximately 120 feet. A red ribbon is tied in the center, and a red ribbon is also tied on each side, ten feet away from the center, as a sign. (2) During the preliminary selection in each district, the school is the unit, and each school participates in one team, limited to 30 people. During the general assembly, the district is the unit, and each district participates in one team, limited to 50 people. (3) The competition adopts an elimination system, using a five-game three-win system to determine the winner. (4) During the competition, each team holds one end of the rope, with the red ribbon in the center aligned with the white line on the ground. Touching the rope with one hand within fifteen feet of the center to either side is forbidden. After the referee gives the order, the two teams pull backwards with all their strength, and the team that pulls the red ribbon of the opposing team over the white line wins. (5) After each win or loss, there is a one-minute break, and then the competition resumes. If no winner is determined within three minutes, the referee will order the game to stop, rest for one minute, and then restart the game until a winner is determined. (6) During the competition, each side has one cheerleader who may use a megaphone to shout.</p>
<h3>Xiqing Volleyball Qixiu Defeats the Bureau of Works Girls' Middle School</h3>
<p>Since the start of the Xiqing Women's Volleyball League, Qixiu and the Bureau of Works Girls' Middle School have won all their battles and are tied for first place. The two teams met for the first time last night, which was no different from the championship finals. After the contact, the Bureau of Works Girls' Middle School showed its power and won several cities first. Qixiu tried hard to counterattack, but had to follow behind. Before long, the Bureau of Works Girls' Middle School easily won the first game 15 to 10. How could Qixiu be weak? Relying on skilled cooperation and sharp spikes, the score rose sharply, and the Bureau of Works Girls' Middle School was helpless. The whole game scored only five points, and Qixiu tied the score 15 to 5. The last game was the key to victory or defeat, and both sides gave their all. Qixiu was ultimately a better player and won the third game 15 to 8 again. Thus, the championship seat has fallen into Qixiu's hands. In another game, Suker defeated the Red Team in three straight games, which has no bearing on the championship. The list of the two Chinese teams and the results of yesterday's competition are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Dr. Zhou Houfu's New Discovery: Electronic Theory</h3>
<p>Enables an extremely simple and unified satisfactory explanation</p>
<p>of the complex and fragmented field of organic chemistry</p>
<p>British expert Ingolde, a leading authority in chemistry,</p>
<p>sends a letter congratulating on its success</p>
<p>Organic chemistry has long been viewed as a complex science. Over the decades, scholars from various countries have proposed numerous theories and rules, but they can only explain a tiny portion of the facts. In addition, many reactions have been seen as irregular and unexplainable. Zhou Houfu, head of the Chemistry Department at Zhejiang University, has devoted himself to the study of organic theory in recent years. He invented a new electronic theory last year, which was published in the Journal of the Chinese Chemical Society and the German Central Chemical Journal. The paper points out the errors of various theories over the decades and encompasses all the facts of organic chemistry. Countless previously incomprehensible reactions are now given an extremely simple and unified satisfactory explanation, transforming a complex and fragmented organic chemistry into an easily understood and memorized subject, similar to the effect of the ionization theory in inorganic chemistry. The main point of Zhou's theory is that it does not recognize that each element occupies a fixed position in the periodic table, but that in fact, the properties of each element can change with the movement of electron positions. For example, carbon can sometimes be equal to boron, sometimes equal to nitrogen or oxygen; nitrogen can sometimes be equal to oxygen, sometimes equal to boron or carbon, and so on. Therefore, the periodic table is actually a continuous function, not occupied by individual elements. It is also acceptable to say that the periodic table is connected by countless elements of different properties. This kind of shift in thickness always depends on the atoms it is connected to and always follows a simple and unchanging rule. Last year, Zhou's paper published in the Journal of the Chinese Chemical Society was sent to contemporary authorities in organic and physical chemistry in Europe and the United States, such as Han Zifei Xu of Germany, who was not a Geller Fayan Division, Bress Noma of France, and Rox and others of the United States, all of whom sent replies praising it. For example, Ingolde of the United Kingdom, the founder of the electronic transfer theory and the highest authority in physical theoretical chemistry in modern times, wrote in his letter: "When I finished reading your paper with great interest, I couldn't help but feel shocked in my emotions, that is, the breadth of your theory's application and the thoroughness of your understanding. I hope that the dissemination of your theory will deepen the world's interest in organic chemical reactions and structural problems from now on. I can assert that most of what you have discussed will be immediately recognized by most countries in Europe and America." Recently, Zhou has further promoted and reorganized his theory and written it into a book of more than 70,000 words, entitled "A New Electronic Theory of Organic Reactions." It draws on extensive evidence, lists hundreds of difficult and unresolved problems in organic chemistry over the past few decades, and gives extremely simple and clear explanations one by one. It also uses the results of physical methods such as X-ray, red internal light, cathode ray analysis, decomposition potential difference of organic groups, and dipole moment to prove the accuracy of his theory. At the end of the book, it also gives a concise description of the theories of organic reactions of various schools in the past for comparison. The book has been published. It is reported that the Shanghai Joint Bookstore is distributing and selling it on consignment. It is expected that after the popularity of Zhou's theory, a major revolution will occur in the entire chemistry field, and it will also occupy an important page in the history of chemistry.</p>

<h3>Private School Association Opposes the Concessions Bureau's Harsh Demands</h3>
<p>The Fire Department claims that the equipment is inadequate for some reason</p>
<p>It is decided to negotiate with the government based on reason</p>
<p>The Private School Association of the First Special District of this port has been working quite intensively recently on the issues of the Concessions Bureau's subsidies and infringement of educational sovereignty. At a meeting held a few days ago, the attending committee members Feng Yixian, Sun Yucai, Jin Yuezhang, Cui Jianwu, Zhang Lingfei, Qi Juechen, Song An, Feng Shuhua, Weng Guoxun, Ge Youren, Li Guixiong, Lin Zhenxin and others unanimously resolved to issue a declaration, the full text of which has been revised and passed by the meeting, and is now specially transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Different Treatment for Chinese and Foreign Schools: Chinese and foreign people residing in the First Special District pay the same 14% of the Concessions Bureau's taxes, but the education subsidies they receive, according to the statistics of 1936, are 35.8 yuan per student for the Japanese, 27.1 yuan per student for Westerners, and only 4.9 yuan per student for us Chinese. In the same area, they fulfill the same obligations, but the rights to education subsidies they enjoy are vastly different. This unequal treatment can be said to be extreme. Unexpectedly, the Concessions Bureau still thinks it is not enough and makes extra harsh demands on this small amount of subsidy funds, creating difficulties in every way. First, it was the toilets and teacups, then the building facilities. Westerners who do not understand education or the environment are assigned to harass the schools from time to time. If the orders are delayed slightly, the subsidies are deducted. Once they are followed, they are changed every morning and evening, and new tricks must be invented every semester. Recently, they have become even more aggressive. Because we Chinese are courteous and easy to deal with, they have gone so far as to limit the number of students in classrooms, investigate all accounts, remodel stairs, and remove window frames. May I ask what regulations the Concessions Bureau is based on? Outside the scope of the subsidy funds, they can review all our accounts. As for limiting classrooms and remodeling stairs, the costs are not cheap. Removing window frames will make it impossible to sleep peacefully at night due to the need to guard against petty thieves. And what benefits does it have for education? If it is said to be an excuse for fire prevention, then schools have disaster avoidance training during the day and teacher supervision, which can gather at a safe location in a few minutes, which cannot be compared to a disorganized crowd. Looking at Shanghai, how many hundreds of fires have there been, and have any students sacrificed themselves?</p>
<p>Infringement of Sovereignty and Contempt for Administration: Not understanding education, not being familiar with the environment, unreasonable interference, infringement of our sovereignty, and contempt for our administration are becoming increasingly serious. It is bound to make the school authorities overwhelmed and unable to comply. To protect sovereignty, they are unwilling to comply and automatically give up the right to subsidies. The Social Bureau has its own authority to supervise Chinese schools, so why bother the Concessions Bureau to act on its behalf? Moreover, the equipment situation of each school that has received subsidies was considered satisfactory by the Concessions Bureau before the subsidies began. Now, the equipment situation is still the same, the number of students is still the same, and the subsidies of as many as seven or eight out of ten schools are deducted or have problems due to nitpicking. Oppression has reached its extreme, and courtesy cannot be said again. A country with independence and a people with freedom cannot belittle themselves and be controlled and dominated by others. Strive for survival, compatriots, why not rise up and fight for it, vowing to fight for equal treatment, demanding an increase in Chinese education funds, and opposing this unreasonable nitpicking and immediately canceling the deadline for renovation notices. If these goals cannot be achieved, then the subsidies are the rights that we Chinese should enjoy after paying taxes. For the sake of national sovereignty, for the sake of education for compatriots in the Concessions, and for the sake of the rights of taxpayers, unite all compatriots in the area and take effective measures to deal with it. And we colleagues in private schools should especially organize our steps and consolidate our ranks to await further orders.</p>
<h3>The Social Bureau Orders Supplementary Schools to Submit Registration Applications</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau believes that a small number of private supplementary schools in the city have been approved for establishment for a long time, but have not yet submitted registration applications after the deadline, which is a violation of the regulations. It is reported that the bureau specially instructed each supplementary school yesterday to complete the registration procedures within one month, otherwise the establishment will be revoked, the school will be ordered to close, or disciplinary action will be taken.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Three-Ply Yarn Plummets</p>
<p>The Yarn Market Feels More and More Unsupported</p>
<p>Recent Hedge Selling Continues</p>
<p>The Market is Exceptionally Slack</p>
<p>The yarn market trend has started to decline slightly. Osaka's three-ply yarn, which had been soaring for days, suddenly fell back yesterday, breaking the 260 yuan mark. As a result, people's hearts were affected. At the same time, the bulls of the past are still selling in the near month, and the pressure is very heavy. As for the spot yarn sales market, it is also normal. However, the North Road office has a good appetite, that is, the situation of US cotton is still stable, and the attitude towards forward purchases is optimistic, and the market is becoming more and more expensive.</p>
<p>Auction Yarn Falls by 1.34 Yuan</p>
<p>Because US cotton rebounded again, the market atmosphere this month was tighter at the opening of the auction yarn market, rising by 0.6 yuan. However, when auctioned to the forward month, it turned downward because the price was high and Jinchang continued to sell in the near month, people's hearts were slack, and the market turned slack. At the same time, the telegram of three-ply yarn was recently close to a decline and far to a rise, and the market situation was more frustrated. At the second auction, the near month suddenly fell by 1.4 yuan, the far month was still able to support it, and the third closing was still mediocre. The auction yarn result was that each month fell by 0.8 yuan to 0.9 yuan to 1 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon opening, the price of three-ply yarn fell, the popularity was even weaker, buyers were lacking, and the market price slowly went downstream. The second and third rounds saw a slight rebound, but until the close, the price of three-ply yarn fell again, losing 5.8 yuan for the near month and 3.4 yuan for the far month compared to the previous day's price. The selling momentum suddenly strengthened. The auction yarn results were that each month fell by 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,050 bales, Gengfeng 2,750 bales, Dachangcheng 3,400 bales, Runkang 2,550 bales, Fukang 1,400 bales, Hengyi 1,600 bales, Yukang 900 bales, Yicheng 600 bales, Dachang 550 bales, and Shenji 500 bales. Jinchang bought 700 bales, Yuda 2,150 bales, Changji 1,200 bales, Taichang 2,800 bales, Xincheng 1,800 bales, Senkang 2,000 bales, Renfeng 1,000 bales, Hengchang 900 bales, and Zhenda 600 bales.</p>
<p>The Jin Gang is the Healthiest for Yarn Sales</p>
<p>The spot yarn sales are still good, but less than the previous day. The Jin Gang's appetite is the healthiest, and 600 bales of goods were opened yesterday. Including other gangs bought a total of 1,385 bales, the selling price is average, and the purchase amount is listed below.</p>
<p>It is Expected that US Cotton Will Rebound</p>
<p>Auction Cotton Fell First Yesterday</p>
<p>The cotton market is falling, and the momentum is very weak. Because Shanghai has a surplus of cotton and the factory's storage is enough for two or three months of use, although foreign cotton is rising steadily, the air force is still strong. In the afternoon, the price of cotton fell due to the decline in the yarn market and the price of three-ply cotton. It is expected that today's US cotton may have a reactive rebound trend.</p>
<p>The Decline of the Far Month of 0.4 Yuan is the Largest</p>
<p>Because US cotton reported a rebound of 16 to 24 pounds, but Indian cotton fell 2.5 to 3 rupees, the cotton market at the opening of the previous market was peaceful and the buying atmosphere was indifferent. Because Shanghai has a sufficient supply of cotton, the yarn market has softened, and the cotton market is even more tired. As a result, each month of auction cotton fell by 0.05 yuan to 0.4 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon opening, the market fell even more because the three-ply cotton market rebounded slightly, and most psychology expected that today's US cotton would have a reactive rebound phenomenon, and the market was even softer. As a result, each month fell by another 0.05 yuan to 0.1 yuan to 0.4 yuan compared with the morning closing price. It was found that Daji sold 1,300 dan, Dafeng 1,100 dan, Chengji 1,500 dan, Hexing 2,200 dan, Yichang 5,700 dan, Runkang 3,800 dan, Yikang 3,200 dan, Xinchang 1,100 dan, Dachang 2,400 dan, and Fukang 1,300 dan. Jinchang bought 1,100 dan, Changji 2,500 dan, Dafeng 1,400 dan, Taichang 5,000 dan, Yuan 1,1800 dan, Yongda 3,500 dan, Changhe 5,300 dan, Ruiyuan 1,200 dan, Juxing 1,100 dan, Daji 1,000 dan, Dachang 1,100 dan, and Tonghe 1,100 dan. The highest and lowest prices in a day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>The Consumption of Spot Cotton is More Prosperous by Japanese Factories</p>
<p>The spot cotton procurement by Chinese merchants is not smooth, while Japanese merchants factories are constantly purchasing Lingbao fine velvet, and there is no source.</p>
<p>Both Hedging and Closing are Available</p>
<p>US Cotton Still Rises by More Than 20 Pounds</p>
<p>At the opening of the US cotton market yesterday, the market was mixed, with each month falling by 2 pounds to rising by 6 pounds. Then speculators bought in, and the market price gradually rose. The spot cotton legs were strong, and spot merchants and colleagues continued to buy. At the same time, the cloth sales were prosperous, and the empty accounts were being covered one after another, and the market situation became more and more firm. Later, the bulls took profits and closed out, and a slight rebound was seen. At the close, it was still firm. It is estimated that the spot price rose by 22 pounds, and the futures rose by 19 to 25 pounds. The British cotton spot price fell by 7 points, and the futures fell by 1 to 3 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to bulls closing out, but then rebounded due to exporters buying in. After that, the amount of bulls closing out and futures merchants selling out was absorbed by those who bought in on dips. It is estimated that Pingle Falls 2.5 to 2.75 rupees, Oumula Falls 2.5 rupees, and Bairoxi Falls 2.5 to 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 9th).</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast on the 10th was 239 rupees for Bairoxi and 222.75 rupees for Oumula, both up 4.5 rupees, and 190.5 rupees for Pingle, up 4.25 rupees.</p>
<p>Three-Ply Futures Yarn Reacts and Falls Back</p>
<p>The Fluctuation of Futures Cotton is Still Small</p>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 10th: The spot price rose by 3 to 5 yuan, 250 yuan for 16-count fans, up 4 yuan, 268 yuan for 20-count goldfish, up 3 yuan, 405 yuan for 40-count five-star, and 399 yuan for 42-count pheasant, both up 5 yuan. The price of three-ply futures yarn fell by 3.4 yuan to 5.8 yuan, 254.1 yuan for the near month, and 258.5 yuan for the far month. The price of futures cotton fell by 0.25 yuan to a rise of 0.3 yuan, 78.95 yuan for the near month, and 82.3 yuan for the far month.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Call Loan Interest Rates Rising, Major Public Bond Investors Emerging</p>
<p>Market Prices Down 4-6 Jiao</p>
<p>After a long period of consolidation, the public bond market showed signs of gradually clearing yesterday. Major bullish investors emerged, while bearish investors continued to release large quantities of physical bonds. At the same time, call loan interest rates tightened, opening at 1.2% yesterday. With arbitrage opportunities diminishing, selling pressure on public bonds intensified. The total amount of margin accounts for this month is still around 20 million. The bearish camp is controlled by major investors with strong financial resources. Therefore, the future trend is likely to continue to be weak and decline. At the opening of trading yesterday morning, the trend was still sluggish. Retail investors were buying, while bonds numbered 35 and 43 were being heavily sold. Category E bonds for this month were up 5 fen, while Category C and A bonds were down 5 fen to 2 jiao. In the second session, bonds numbered 5 and 35 continued to be sold off significantly, while bond 10 saw considerable buying. Market prices continued to fall by 5 fen to 2 jiao. At the opening of trading in the afternoon, activity increased, but the market remained weak. Bonds numbered 43 and 32 were being heavily dumped, while bond 5 also saw significant selling. Category E bonds rose again by a small amount, from 5 fen to 3 jiao 5 fen. The closing trend remained sluggish, with considerable selling of bond 43 at each level. Bonds numbered 5 and 35 continued to be dumped. Market prices fell again by a small amount, from 5 fen to 3 jiao 5 fen. Overall, the results for the day showed a uniform decline of 2 jiao 5 fen to 6 jiao. The total transaction volume was 4,715,000 yuan. The comparison of price increases and decreases, highs and lows, is listed in the table below: (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: Hundred Yuan)</p>

<p>Flour Actual Sales Stalled</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a pattern of rising first and then falling in all contract months after opening in the morning. Foreign wheat quotations were positive, with Chicago up 2-3 jiao, Canada up 3-4 jiao, and Liverpool up 1 penny. Therefore, the opening prices were quite encouraging, rising by about 1 fen compared to the previous day's closing prices. However, after this, prices gradually fell back. Recent actual sales stalled, and non-industry bullish investors had to release positions along with the market. April contracts also saw bullish investors becoming weak. July and August contracts are new flour, and with increased releases to market, prices also leveled off. As of the opening of trading in the afternoon, recent contracts such as March and April saw little activity in actual sales. Bullish investors slightly liquidated positions, falling another 1 fen compared to the morning. July and August contracts also fell 1 fen due to new short selling. Currently, if sales remain sluggish, the market in the near term is expected to continue to be weak.</p>
<p>Japanese Flour Shipping to Shanghai</p>
<p>Although the Volume is Small... Future Concerns</p>
<p>In the past six months, Japanese goods have been imported in large quantities, with weekly volumes consistently reaching 10,000 tons. According to the shipping industry, this has almost restored the situation before the January 28th Incident. As a result, Japanese merchants are all delighted. As for the imported Japanese goods, sugar, rayon, steel, lead wire, and chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid, have been the most common, as reported previously. However, yesterday's imported Japanese vessel Mikasa Maru carried 3,140 tons of cargo, including 1,000 bags of flour in addition to sugar and steel plates. Since flour and wheat prices have been rising, this is enough to entice the import of foreign flour. In the Tianjin area, Japanese flour has a special position and has the potential to replace domestic flour. Shanghai, on the other hand, has numerous flour mills and has traditionally supplied various regions. Now, Japanese flour is being imported. It is unknown what the machine-made flour industry thinks and how it will respond.</p>
<p>Price Declines Even Greater</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was sluggish and weak in all contract months. Although foreign wheat quotations were up 2-3-4 jiao and 1 penny, recent flour sales have been weak. Although some rivers in the north have opened, trading has been quiet. The main reason is that the market price of domestic flour is too high. Japanese flour is taking the opportunity to promote sales. With the wheat market not driven by flour sales, it has to trend towards softening. Therefore, this month's contracts fell by 7 fen, and distant contracts also lacked luster. By the opening of trading in the afternoon, this month's contracts became soft again due to the difficult flour market. The lowest price was 6 jiao 2 fen, a huge drop of 1 jiao 3 fen compared to the previous day. April contracts also fell by 5 fen. New wheat contracts from June onward saw little trading and remained quiet. The sharp fall in this month's contracts was partly due to bullish investors becoming nervous and exiting positions, and partly due to rumors of new short selling entering the market, resulting in a complete collapse. Currently, the wheat market is weak due to the lack of improvement in flour sales and a decline in the standard. Therefore, prices are being lowered by another 2-3 fen. Shandong wheat is quoted at 6 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen, Tiantai wheat at 6 yuan 6 jiao 1-2 fen, and Huaian wheat at 6 yuan 6 jiao 3 fen, with an estimated 1,000 bags traded.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil Cake Suddenly Returned Downward in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the standard soybean oil cake market opened in the morning, continuing the previous day's bullish momentum. Continuous telegrams reported price increases, and soybean oil cake prices in all markets were firm. However, the actual soybean processing by factories decreased yesterday, with only merchant groups handling small amounts. The consumption of oil cake was also average, and there were rumors of a decline in telegrams from Dalian. Short sellers immediately hedged, and bullish investors also sought to liquidate positions. In the afternoon, prices in all sessions followed the market and trended downward. The closing price for standard oil fell by 2 jiao to 3 jiao 5 fen, standard soybeans fell by 4-5 fen, and standard cake fell by 2.5 fen to 1.5 fen.</p>
<p>River Rice Sales Not Improving</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various groups was relatively scarce, totaling only about 20 groups, with approximately 4,700-4,800 piculs of goods. The local sales market was sluggish, and buyers were weak. Tianjin groups handled 7-8 packages of Bo Dao rice, and Xi'an groups handled 700-800 packages of thick Japonica rice. Therefore, the market situation remained weak. As a result, thick Japonica rice prices fell again by 5 fen to 1 jiao, while Bo Dao rice continued to depreciate. The situation seems difficult to improve. Du Yang pointed rice was slightly soft, and Yin Yuan rice had no market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were few boats arriving from various places along the river, only about 7-8. Due to the weather being intermittently cloudy and rainy, few shops listed goods on the market. Trading of various goods on the market became increasingly quiet. White Japonica rice prices were weak, and high-priced Bo Dao rice was not fixed. Medium and lower grade Bo Dao rice and early rice were weak. Bai Yuan rice and various indica rices remained sluggish. Other rices were slightly soft.</p>
<p>(Passenger Indica) Arrivals were still strong yesterday, and inventory was also high. The appetite of local and visiting merchants was weak in the morning. Local, Quanzhou, and Cantonese groups handled hundreds of packages. Only 3,000-4,000 packages were traded in half a day, and prices immediately fell by a small amount of 5-6 fen. In the afternoon, Cantonese consumption revived, and 5,000 packages of brown rice and over 1,000 packages of white rice were actively handled in the market. Local merchants also continued to handle, and market prices quickly turned upward, rebounding by 5-6-7 fen. Goods owners also eased their efforts to depreciate prices to sell, and the situation returned to stability. A total of over 8,000 packages of Jiangxi rice, over 2,000 packages of Hunan rice, and 1,000 packages of Han brown rice were released throughout the day.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Light-Colored Goods Selling Slightly Slower</p>
<p>– Not Without Influence From the Weather</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market showed a pattern of firmness followed by weakness, inevitably following the ups and downs of the yarn market. However, actual sales are expected to continue to develop, and trading in various goods is gradually becoming active.

<p>Lead Selling Firmly, Little Actual Sales</p>
<p>Fixed prices for lead have been increasing continuously in recent days. Therefore, local market prices have also been rising accordingly. Yesterday, the selling price was 43 yuan per picul, an increase of approximately 1 yuan. However, actual sales were limited, and the market appeared quite sluggish. It was found that only over 200 strips were handled by visiting groups yesterday, and the buying and selling of factories seemed very quiet.</p>
<p>Imports Exceed Exports, Dutch and Italian Imports Over 6,000 Tons</p>
<p>January's Foreign Trade Surplus</p>
<p>Recent Imports Show Increased Activity</p>
<p>According to previous reports from the customs, the foreign trade surplus for January was 5 million. Goods shipped to Europe and America were mainly silk and tea, followed by tung oil, egg yolk, egg white, and other products. Since the second half of last year, soybeans, sesame seeds, and other miscellaneous grains have been shipped to Europe, and a small amount of flour has been shipped to Java, Singapore, and other places. It is now known that the Italian vessel Conto Fante, which will export the day after tomorrow (12th), is carrying 1,000 tons of sesame seeds to Italy. The vessel imported 1,000 tons yesterday, including 650 boxes of rayon, over 200 boxes of piece goods, and other items such as foreign paper, steel, and machinery. The Dutch vessel that arrived the day before yesterday carried a large quantity of white wax, 23,360 packages, sugar, over 28,500 bags, and approximately 5,000 tons of rubber, starch, and tea. The import of Japanese goods has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper and does not need to be repeated. Therefore, although there was a foreign trade surplus in January, indicating a lot of exports, recent imports have also been very crowded. It is unknown if there will be another month with similar records in the future.</p>
<h3>Preparation Method for Income Tax Return Forms (7)</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>(3) Report Form for Deposits Received by Commercial Firms</p>
<p>The third category of the current income tax is income from securities and deposits. According to Article 27 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the income tax on deposit interest should be withheld by the person in charge of the business of the interest-paying institution. The so-called interest-paying institution, in addition to financial institutions such as banks and money shops, is also a commercial firm that receives deposits. This form is used by such commercial firms to report the receipt of deposits, so that the responsible collection authority can audit them. As for the future withholding of income tax on deposit interest, there is another report form for the amount of income from the third category of securities and deposits. According to the current commercial law, the receipt of deposits is limited to financial institutions such as banks and money shops. Commercial firms receiving deposits is not permitted by law. However, in fact, commercial firms that receive deposits are common. If the third category of deposit interest income tax is only levied on formal financial institutions, the deposits of financial institutions will escape to commercial firms, which would be contrary to the government's intention to supervise financial institutions to protect depositors. Therefore, the current laws on income tax, based on the facts, levy taxes on commercial firms that receive deposits in the same way as financial institutions. The tax rate has also recently been reduced from 50 per mille to 40 per mille, as with financial institutions. This form is called the Report Form for Deposits Received by Commercial Firms. The term "commercial firm" should be interpreted broadly in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 of the General Rules for Merchants. All companies, commercial firms, commercial depots, factories, and for-profit individuals mentioned in Article 46 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations that receive deposits should fill out this report form. The method of preparing this form is explained below:</p>
<p>(1) Commercial Firm Name, Address, Industry, Telephone: In accordance with Articles 85 and 46 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, all companies, commercial firms, commercial depots, factories, and for-profit individuals should fill in their commercial firm name, address, and business type in the Company Report Form and the Firm Report Form, respectively. The commercial firm name, address, and industry to be filled in in this form should be the same as those to be filled in in these report forms. As for the telephone number, it is filled in for the convenience of the collection authority in contacting the firm and has no great significance.</p>
<p>(2) Types of Deposits: The types of deposits received by ordinary commercial firms are nothing more than time deposits, demand deposits, and colleague savings. As for savings deposits, only savings banks and banks that also operate savings may receive them. According to Article 1 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the third category of income tax, that is, the taxation of income from securities and deposit interest, the so-called "deposit" should be interpreted as deposited funds. However, according to the interpretation of the Ministry of Finance, the interest earned on disguised deposit loans between ordinary stores and individuals that are for the purpose of earning interest should also be taxed. Furthermore, according to Article 3 of the draft Notice on the Collection of Income from the Third Category of Securities and Deposits, the interest on funds borrowed by non-banking and money industries, commercial firms, groups, and individuals to companies and commercial firms should also be taxed. Therefore, regardless of whether the books record funds borrowed that do not come from banks or money shops as deposited funds or borrowed funds, they should be entered in this form, and time-limited borrowed funds and demand-limited borrowed funds should be added to the types of deposits. When ordinary commercial firms settle interest on borrowings or transactions with banks or money shops, they should pay all of the interest in full and may not withhold income tax on the interest. Therefore, such borrowings or transactions do not need to be entered in this form.</p>
<p>(3) Total Number of Depositors: The deposits entered in this form are the total number of accounts and the total amount of various types of depositors. There is no need to enter the name and amount of each account. For example, three time deposit accounts with a total deposit amount of 36,000 yuan. This number of accounts and total deposit amount should be based on the current situation on the date of entry. Regardless of how quickly the amount of the deposit changes, only the total amount on the date of entry needs to be entered, and there is no need to report any changes that occur in the future.</p>
<p>(4) Name of Responsible Person and Date of Entry: The year and date of entry are the year and date of entry of this form. According to Article 27 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the withholding of the third category of income tax should be done by the person in charge of the business of the interest-paying institution. The name of the responsible person entered in this form should be the person in charge of the business who is responsible for withholding. The so-called person in charge of the business is the chairman of the board, manager, or factory owner, owner, etc. of companies, commercial firms, commercial depots, factories, etc. According to the current income tax system, the taxation of the first category of income, that is, the income of profit-making enterprises, is based on the principle of adopting the declaration method. The taxation of the second category of income, that is, income from salaries and remuneration, and the third category of income, that is, income from securities and deposits, is based on the principle of adopting the source taxation method. The income tax of the source taxation method should be withheld by the paying institution. According to Articles 18 to 20 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Article 35 of the Detailed Rules for Implementation, if the responsible person for withholding fails to report within the time limit, or is negligent in reporting, or conceals the report, or makes a false report, or fails to pay the tax within the time limit, they will be subject to penalties. If the amount withheld is insufficient, they shall be liable for compensation. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Feast at Hong Gate</h3>
<p>— Zhong Bao</p>
<p>Xiang Yu of Chu was a great man with high ambitions and great talent, but unfortunately, his capacity was too small and did not match his talent and ambition. Therefore, although he could achieve great fame, he ultimately suffered defeat and disgrace. He originally had many talented people under his command, but they gradually all went over to Gaozu of Han, because Xiang Yu was reluctant to reward people with high positions and generous salaries, and he was competitive, unwilling to admit that anyone's talent could surpass his own. Since they could not obtain substantial benefits nor receive respect, of course, no one was willing to work for him willingly. Gaozu of Han was the opposite. He had small ambitions (he only wanted children, jade, and silk, and had no intention of becoming emperor. He only had this intention later because others taught him), and small talent, but his capacity was large, he could tolerate people, employ people, and was willing to give people benefits. Therefore, the lower-level scholars were all happy to work for him, and thus he was able to be invincible in the world. What Xiang Yu learned was "the ability to defeat ten thousand enemies," so he was a good general. What Gaozu could do was trustworthiness and tolerance, so he was a great leader. Judging from these two men, it can be known that failure and success are not accidental. The Feast at Hong Gate was the greatest difficulty in Gaozu's life. The reason he was able to overcome this difficulty was entirely due to his ability to gain the support of talented people on a regular basis. When something happened, there were people willing to go through fire and water and work hard for him, so how could he not succeed?</p>
<p>During the reign of the tyrannical Second Emperor of Qin, heroes rose up in revolution. Liang, the uncle of Xiang Yu of Chu, in order to facilitate the call to arms, established Xin, the grandson of King Huai of Chu, as King of Chu, and everyone respected him as the common lord (in reality, he was a puppet). At that time, the Qin army was still very strong, and everyone was afraid of confronting them head-on. King Huai felt that the most important thing at the time was to destroy Qin, so when it came time to appoint generals to set out, he made an agreement with the generals, saying:</p>
<p>"Whoever enters Guanzhong first shall be king of Guanzhong."</p>
<p>The generals looked at each other, each with a difficult expression. Gaozu of Han, because he had woken up too early that day and lacked energy, was constantly yawning in the ranks and did not pay attention to what King Huai was saying. Unexpectedly, King Huai took a liking to him and kept looking at him several times, wanting to call him to go. This made Zhang Liang, who was standing behind Gaozu, very anxious. He did not know what method to use to remind Gaozu. He scratched his scalp a few times and came up with an idea. He stepped heavily on the back of Gaozu's shoe and whispered:</p>
<p>"You should say, 'I'll go.'"</p>
<p>"I'll go!" Gaozu said to King Huai as expected, but in fact, he still had no idea where he was going, but he believed that Zhang Liang's plan would not be wrong.</p>
<p>"I am also willing to go with Duke Pei (Gaozu was once supported by the people as the magistrate of Pei County, and people often called him Duke Pei)." Xiang Yu's ambition was the entire world. He looked down on the mere Qin state. He was now vying to go because he hated Qin for defeating his uncle's army, and he wanted to take revenge himself.</p>
<p>"That won't do! That won't do!" The old generals of King Huai were afraid that King Huai would agree to Xiang Yu, so they hurriedly stopped him anxiously. This was not a formal court, and many formalities could be disregarded. Everyone could speak freely. "Xiang Yu is fierce, cruel, and frivolous. He once conquered Xiangcheng, and all the people of Xiangcheng were buried alive by him, not one was left. No matter where he goes, there is always a great massacre. It is better to send a benevolent person to the west to uphold justice, to inform the elders of Qin, to subdue them with virtue, not with force. The elders of Qin have been tormented by their masters for a long time. If a truly benevolent person is sent, who does not mistreat them, Qin can certainly be broken. Xiang Yu is fierce, do not send him. Only Duke Pei has always been generous and is an elder statesman, qualified to go."</p>
<p>King Huai indeed only sent Gaozu west to conquer Qin and did not allow Xiang Yu to go. However, Xiang Yu was not so easily controlled. He did not listen to King Huai, turned around and killed a senior general, made himself senior general, and led the armies of the feudal lords to attack Qin from another route. At that time, Qin was attacking Julu, and Xiang Yu personally led troops to teach them a lesson. He saw that the feudal lords' armies were all useless things and did not rely on them. He led the Chu army alone across the Zhang River. After crossing the river, he sank all the boats, broke all the cooking pots, and burned all the houses where the soldiers lived, retaining only enough food for three days. Then he said to the soldiers:</p>
<p>"People say that we Chu people only know how to fight losing battles. How can we wipe out the shame without winning a battle? I believe that it is better for a man to die for wiping out the shame than to live in humiliation. I am determined to die rather than be humiliated. Chu soldiers, you should also have such ambition. Look, we only have three days of food, and all means of retreat have been cut off. If you want to survive, you must fight desperately. The road ahead is your only way to survive."</p>
<p>As Xiang Yu spoke, his bright, round eyes turned, and his majestic and sharp gaze shot into the body of every soldier. They were like being struck by electricity, and they immediately rose up in great rebellion, becoming excited and their courage increased a hundredfold. They fought nine major battles with the Qin army, cut off the Qin army's knowledge, and killed several Qin generals. The Qin army was utterly defeated and could not be salvaged.</p>
<p>At this time, many of the feudal lords' armies came to rescue Julu, building more than a dozen camps here and there, but they were all afraid of the Qin soldiers and dared not come forward. When the Chu soldiers and Qin soldiers were engaged in battle, the generals of the feudal lords' armies all climbed onto the camp walls to watch. They saw that the Chu soldiers were all fighting one against ten, men turned into bloody men, horses turned into bloody horses, and they were still fighting. Sometimes, when they saw until their eyes blurred, they only saw streaks of red light, and they simply could not distinguish between men, horses, and knives. The shouts of the Chu soldiers shook the sky, almost bursting their eardrums. They huddled together in fear, their teeth chattering constantly, everything seemed involuntary. Finally, the news of the Chu army's victory woke them up. Xiang Yu summoned them, and they were truly in awe of him. As they entered the camp gate, they knelt and walked in, and no one dared to look up at Xiang Yu. Thus, Xiang Yu became the true general of the feudal lords.</p>
<p>Xiang Yu led his mighty army into Qin. His personal demeanor was heroic, unparalleled in the world, but unfortunately, he only relied on his own strength, which was ultimately limited. As a result, he could not catch up with Gaozu of Han, who had many strategists and warriors under his command. Gaozu actually entered Guanzhong first, and even advanced further, conquering Xianyang and obtaining the entire Qin state. This made Xiang Yu very angry. He jumped up and broke his beloved halberd, cursing loudly:</p>
<p>"A toad wants to eat swan meat! What is your status, Liu Bang (Gaozu of Han's surname was Liu, and his given name was Bang)? A petty pavilion chief from Sishui, a rascal, dares to compete with me, Xiang Yu, for the world? You want to be King of Qin? Good, let me boil you first!"</p>
<p>Xiang Yu acted unreasonably and used force to enter Guanzhong.</p>
<p>On the other side, Gaozu of Han was still "completely clueless." He saw the magnificence of the Xianyang Palace and the charming beauty of Zhao Nü Weiji, and he was so happy that he beamed, his whole body paralyzed. He said to his attendants with a smile:</p>
<p>"Let me just live here."</p>
<p>Someone reported this to Fan Kuai and Zhang Liang, who hurriedly came to dissuade him:</p>
<p>"If Your Lordship is greedy today, you will lose the hearts of the people, and the great cause will be lost!"</p>
<p>Gaozu was reminded by them and immediately woke up. He hardened his heart and left the Xianyang Palace without even turning his head. He ordered people to hide all the treasures and wealth of the Qin state in the treasury, and let the women leave the palace to choose their own spouses freely. He preserved his own clean body and returned to the army camp at Bashang spotlessly. When the soldiers and people saw Gaozu's nobility, everyone admired and encouraged themselves. Gaozu also listened to Zhang Liang's advice and summoned the elders and heroes of the various counties to announce:</p>
<p>"The elders have suffered from the harsh laws of Qin for a long time! Those who slander are exterminated, and those who talk about matters are questioned. I also made an agreement with the feudal lords that whoever enters Guanzhong first shall be King of Guanzhong. Today, I entered first, so of course I am your king. I do not want any harsh laws that trouble the people, I only make three laws with the elders: those who kill will die, those who injure others and those who steal will be punished according to the severity of their crimes. The personnel will remain the same, without any changes. The reason I came is to eliminate harm for the elders, not to invade or be tyrannical. Do not be afraid! I am now returning to the army camp at Bashang, but only to wait for the feudal lords to make an agreement."</p>
<p>Gaozu sent people and Qin officials to announce this everywhere, and the Qin people were very happy, vying to send cattle, sheep, wine, and food to comfort the Han army, fearing that Gaozu would not be the King of Qin.</p>
<p>Xiang Yu arrived at Xixi. Gaozu only found out then. Gaozu thought that even if Xiang Yu came, he could not break the agreement without a reason, so he did not take it seriously at all. Cao Wushang, the Left Sima of Gaozu, was a petty person. He heard that Xiang Yu was angry and wanted to attack Gaozu. He believed that Gaozu could not defeat Xiang Yu. He wanted to reserve a position for himself in advance, so he willingly acted as a Han traitor and secretly told Xiang Yu:</p>
<p>"Come and deal with Duke Pei quickly! He wants to be King of Guanzhong, he has already made Ziying (the Qin king who newly surrendered to Gaozu) prime minister, and he wants all the treasures in the Qin palace."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow, feed the soldiers well and go break Duke Pei's army!" Xiang Yu was very angry when he heard the person's words and immediately ordered an attack on Gaozu.</p>
<p>"When Duke Pei lived in Shandong, he was greedy for wealth and fond of beautiful women. Today, when he entered Guanzhong, he took nothing, and favored no women, which shows that his ambition is not small. He is your opponent. Attack him quickly, do not miss the opportunity!" Xiang Yu's advisor Fan Zeng, having found out about Gaozu's affairs very clearly, took the opportunity to persuade Xiang Yu to take action as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(Fan Zeng was also a person with great talent but small capacity. He did not know that a person with small capacity cannot achieve anything. He believed that a person's failure was mostly caused by being plotted against by others. If he killed all those who surpassed him, he would be the number one in the world. He did not know that "one chicken dies, another chicken crows," and the talented people in the world cannot be killed. A person with small capacity is jealous of others, plots against others, and is mentally and physically exhausted all day long, which only hastens his own demise.)</p>
<p>Xiang Bo, the Left Yin of Chu and uncle of Xiang Yu, had always been on good terms with Zhang Liang. He hurriedly ran into the Han army at night, found Zhang Liang, and said in a panic:</p>
<p>"Brother, run quickly! Tomorrow, King Xiang will send a large army to attack Duke Pei. When the time comes, jade and stone will be burned together, and you will not survive! Brother has a great future and cannot make useless sacrifices. Come with me quickly!"</p>
<p>"Duke Pei has treated me very well. Today, he is in trouble, and I will run away. This is not something a righteous man should do. I must tell him this news."</p>
<p>Without waiting for Xiang Bo to agree, Zhang Liang ran into Gaozu's tent and told him everything.</p>
<p>"What should I do? What should I do?" Gaozu jumped up from the bed in shock and kept asking.</p>
<p>"Who gave you the plan to anger King Xiang?"</p>
<p>"A scholar. He said that if I guarded the pass and did not let the feudal lords' armies in, I could be king of the entire Qin territory. Therefore, I listened to his words." Gaozu said regretfully.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, think for yourself, can your army defeat King Xiang?"</p>
<p>"Of course not." Gaozu replied disappointedly.</p>
<p>"Then, how can you argue with him? Please go see Xiang Bo and say that Duke Pei dares not betray King Xiang."</p>
<p>"How do you know Xiang Bo?"</p>
<p>"This matter dates back to before the fall of Qin.</p>
<p>He was friends with me. He killed someone and was sentenced to death. I saved him, so today, in an emergency, he came to tell me."</p>
<p>"Who is older?"</p>
<p>"He is older than me."</p>
<p>"Please invite him for me, so that I may treat him like an elder brother."</p>
<p>Zhang Liang came out to invite Xiang Bo. Xiang Bo could not refuse out of consideration for their friendship and had to go see Gaozu. Gaozu laid out a grand feast to entertain Xiang Bo, raised his wine cup to wish him a long life, and made a marriage alliance with him. Gaozu first persuaded him, and then said the main point:</p>
<p>"I heard that someone is speaking ill of me in front of the general. In fact, I have done nothing to offend the general. When I entered Guanzhong, I took nothing, registered the people, and sealed the treasury to await the general. The reason I sent a general to guard the pass was to guard against thieves and other accidents. I have been waiting for the general day and night, how dare I rebel? I hope you will tell the general that I dare not betray virtue!"</p>
<p>"Do not worry, I can speak on your behalf, but you must come early tomorrow to apologize to King Xiang!" Xiang Bo, this honest man, believed Gaozu's words and comforted him with a look of pity.</p>
<p>"Of course, I will definitely go early." Gaozu replied with a very respectful manner.</p>
<p>Xiang Bo did not dare to delay and returned at night, telling Xiang Yu the truth and advising him:</p>
<p>"If Duke Pei had not broken through Guanzhong first, how could you have entered? It is unjust to attack someone who has made great contributions. It is better to treat him kindly because of this."</p>
<p>Xiang Yu agreed.</p>
<p>At that time, Gaozu's army was at Bashang, with only 100,000 men; Xiang Yu's army was at Hong Gate in Xinfeng, with 400,000 men. If they really fought, Gaozu would certainly not be able to defeat Xiang Yu.</p>
<p>The next day, Gaozu brought a hundred horsemen to Hong Gate to see Xiang Yu. When Xiang Yu saw that Gaozu had actually come to apologize in person, he felt relieved. (A person with small capacity, the most important thing is that others are willing to yield to him. Once they yield to him, he thinks he has won, he is satisfied, and he has no intention of blaming or guarding against others.) Gaozu said to Xiang Yu the words he had learned from Zhang Liang the night before:</p>
<p>"I and the general worked together to attack Qin. The general fought north of the river, and I fought south of the river. Unexpectedly, I entered Guanzhong and broke through Qin first, and was able to meet the general here again. Today, there are petty people sowing discord, causing the general to doubt me. I have always loved and respected the general and do not want to hurt the general's heart because of my unworthiness, so I have come here to apologize in person."</p>
<p>"This was all said by your Left Sima Cao Wushang. Otherwise, how would Ji (Xiang Yu's given name) have doubted you?"</p>
<p>Xiang Yu held a banquet for Duke Pei that day. Xiang Yu and Xiang Bo sat facing east, Fan Zeng sat facing south, Duke Pei sat facing north, and Zhang Liang sat facing west as an attendant. Fan Zeng originally wanted to end Gaozu's life at the banquet. During the drinking, he gave Xiang Yu several glances, and also took the jade jue he wore and raised it three times, hinting that Xiang Yu should make a decision immediately and order Gaozu to be killed. Xiang Yu thought to himself, "What can this poor wretch Duke Pei do? It is not chivalrous to kill him, let him go." Therefore, he remained silent and ignored Fan Zeng. Seeing that Xiang Yu was unwilling to take action, Fan Zeng had to come out himself and find Xiang Yu's cousin Xiang Zhuang, saying to him:</p>
<p>"The king is too soft-hearted, truly a mistake! It is better for us to do it ourselves. Go in and offer a toast, and after the toast, kill Duke Pei at the banquet, otherwise we will be captured by him one day."</p>
<p>Xiang Zhuang entered to offer a toast. After the toast, he requested Xiang Yu:</p>
<p>"The king is entertaining Duke Pei, and there is nothing to entertain with in the army. Please allow me to dance with a sword!"</p>
<p>"Good." Xiang Yu did not know Xiang Zhuang's intention, thinking that he truly wanted to entertain the guest, so he agreed.</p>
<p>Xiang Zhuang drew his sword and began to dance, the tip of the sword often pointing at Gaozu, wanting to find an opportunity to assassinate him. Seeing that this was not right, Xiang Bo was afraid that Xiang Zhuang would cause trouble, so he also got up to dance with a sword, often using his body to shield Gaozu. The situation was very tense. Zhang Liang hurriedly ran out of the army gate to find Fan Kuai to protect him.</p>
<p>"What is happening today?" Fan Kuai asked anxiously when he saw Zhang Liang.</p>
<p>"It is extremely urgent! Today, Xiang Zhuang is dancing with a sword at the banquet, and his intention is often directed at Duke Pei."</p>
<p>"Then, he wants to kill Duke Pei! Let me go in and fight him."</p>
<p>Fan Kuai immediately entered with a sword. The guards at the army gate, holding halberds, stopped him from entering. He knocked down the guards with his shield, broke free and ran in, leaning against the curtain and standing facing west, angrily staring at Xiang Yu with a pair of red, round eyes, looking as if he wanted to swallow him. Xiang Yu was startled and hurriedly knelt down (in ancient times, people sat on the ground, kneeling was to raise the body, preparing to get up easily) and asked with a sword:</p>
<p>"What does this guest want?"</p>
<p>"He is Duke Pei's charioteer, Fan Kuai," Zhang Liang replied.</p>
<p>At this time, because a new guest had entered, the sword dance was temporarily stopped, but Duke Pei had already lost his mind completely.</p>
<p>"He is a brave man, give him a large cup to drink." Xiang Yu ordered.</p>
<p>Fan Kuai thanked him and got up, drinking the wine.</p>
<p>"Give him a shoulder of pork." Xiang Yu ordered again.</p>
<p>They gave Fan Kuai a raw pork shoulder. Fan Kuai placed the shield on the ground, put the pork shoulder on the shield, and cut it with his sword to eat.</p>
<p>"Brave man, can you still drink?" Xiang Yu asked.</p>
<p>"I do not avoid death, what is a cup of wine to refuse?" Fan Kuai could no longer bear it and took the opportunity to say everything he wanted to say all at once: "The King of Qin had the heart of a tiger and wolf, and did his best to kill the innocent, so the world betrayed him. King Huai made an agreement with the feudal lords that whoever broke through Qin and entered Xianyang first would be King of Qin. Today, Duke Pei broke through Qin and entered Xianyang first, and dared not take anything, sealing the palace and garrisoning at Bashang, to await the King. Therefore, the reason for sending a general to guard the pass was to guard against other thieves and accidents. His hard work and achievements are so great, and yet there has been no reward for him, and the King actually listens to the words of petty people and wants to kill those who have contributed. This is exactly the continuation of the fall of Qin, and I humbly believe that the King should not do this."</p>
<p>He spoke with righteousness and strength, so that Xiang Yu could not answer. Xiang Yu had to change his expression, treat him with courtesy, and invite him to sit with Zhang Liang. After sitting for a while, Gaozu wanted to get up to relieve himself, and Zhang Liang and Fan Kuai followed him out. At this time, the banquet had not ended, and Xiang Yu sent the captain Chen Ping to invite Gaozu back. Gaozu wanted to leave, but he also wanted to turn back, not knowing what to do. He asked Zhang Liang and Fan Kuai:</p>
<p>"I want to leave, but I have not said goodbye, what should I do?"</p>
<p>"Great actions do not concern themselves with small details, and great ceremonies do not decline small concessions. Today, others are the knife and chopping board, and we are the fish and meat, what is there to decline?"</p>
<p>Fan Kuai wanted Gaozu to leave immediately, so Gaozu left Zhang Liang to apologize for him.</p>
<p>"What gifts did the King bring?" Zhang Liang asked.</p>
<p>"I brought a pair of white jade bi to offer to King Xiang: a pair of jade dou to offer to Yafu (Fan Zeng, King Xiang respected him as Yafu). They have always been angry, and I dare not offer them. Now, please offer them for me!" Gaozu instructed Zhang Liang in this way.</p>
<p>"Good, let me offer them."</p>
<p>Xiang Yu's army camp and Gaozu's were forty li apart. Gaozu decided not to ride in a carriage, but to ride a horse, bringing Fan Kuai, Xiahou Ying, Jin Qiang, and Ji Xin, four people who walked behind him carrying swords and shields, walking from Lishan, through the Jian path in Zhiyang. Before leaving, Gaozu said to Zhang Liang:</p>
<p>"From this road to our army camp, it is only twenty li. You guess that I have already arrived before you come to see King Xiang."</p>
<p>Gaozu left for a long time. Zhang Liang guessed that he had already arrived at the army camp before he entered to apologize, saying: "Duke Pei drank a few too many cups and could not bear it, he was so drunk that he could not say goodbye in person, so he respectfully sent his servant Liang to offer a pair of white jade bi, bowing twice to the feet of the great king: a pair of jade dou, bowing twice to the feet of the great general."</p>
<p>"Where is Duke Pei now?" Xiang Yu asked.</p>
<p>"Duke Pei heard that the Great King intended to reprimand him, he was afraid, and left alone, thinking that he has already arrived at the army camp."</p>
<p>Xiang Yu said nothing, took the white jade bi, and casually placed it on his seat. Fan Zeng received the jade dou, angrily threw it on the ground, drew his sword and smashed them, sighing:</p>
<p>"Alas! This boy is not worth planning with, the one who will seize King Xiang's world will definitely be Duke Pei. We will all be captured by him today."</p>
<p>As soon as Gaozu returned to the army camp, he killed Zeng Wushang. A few days later, Xiang Yu led his troops west to slaughter Xianyang, killing the surrendered Qin prince Ziying, setting fire to the Afang Palace, and burning it for three months, the fire still not abating. Xiang Yu took the treasures and women, loaded them full and went east, seizing them and returning to his hometown. Someone said to King Xiang:</p>
<p>"The passes in Guanzhong are dangerous and can be used as a barrier, with Hangu Pass in the east, Wu Pass in the south, San Pass in the west, and Xiao Pass in the north to resist enemies. At the same time, the land is fertile and the people are wealthy, which can be developed. Building a capital and establishing a country here is truly the undertaking of a hegemon."</p>
<p>Xiang Yu did not listen because he saw that the Qin palaces were already broken and uninhabitable, and he also missed his homeland very much. He said:</p>
<p>"If you do not return to your hometown when you are rich and noble, it is like wearing brocade clothes and traveling at night, who will see it?"</p>
<p>The person who spoke to Xiang Yu sighed with him: "People say that Chu people are monkeys who wash their heads and wear hats, it is completely true!"</p>
<p>Someone told Xiang Yu about this sentence, and Xiang Yu was angry and boiled the person who said it to death.</p>
<p>Fan Zeng recognized that Xiang Yu could not be done with, and bid farewell to return home. He was so angry that he could hardly walk. On the way, a carbuncle grew on his back and he died.</p>
<p>(Although Xiang Yu was temporarily prosperous, in the end, he acted alone and could not defeat Gaozu, who had the help of many people.)</p>

<h3>Talking About National Maps</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianze</p>
<p>Geography is the study of the relationship between human life and the natural environment, and the most important tool for studying geography is the map. All advanced countries in the world strive for precision and detail in the compilation and drawing of maps, and the division of colors in their compilation and drawing used to be based on political regions, but now it has progressed to using colors to represent the contour lines of topography, and from the height of the terrain, to explore the water systems, mountain ranges, as well as the climate, population, customs, language, agricultural products, mineral products, transportation, commercial ports, and other conditions. This is a major progress in map compilation and drawing, and it is also a more beneficial tool for geography researchers.</p>
<p>In recent years, the map compilation and drawing industry in our country has been more prosperous and more advanced than in previous years. For example, in addition to those published by the Commercial Press, the China Book Company, the Kaiming Bookstore, the World Bookstore, and the Zhengshu Bookstore, there are also academic societies specializing in map research and compilation, such as the "World Geography Society," the "Oriental Geography Society," and the "Shanghai Geography Society." According to statistics, the number of maps published about our country, including wall maps, provincial maps, detailed local maps, as well as population density maps, boundary change maps, transportation maps, and agricultural, forestry, and livestock distribution maps, is only a few dozen types, all of which are for general practical use and as tools for geography courses in primary and secondary schools. Compared with European, American, and Japanese countries, the total number of items printed and compiled is far from comparable, but the trend of map progress gradually adopts topographic maps with contour lines and color layers, which can be said to be in line with scientific methods.</p>
<p>The national maps needed today certainly require the above-mentioned standards in their compilation and drawing, and there are several points that our people hope should be noted, as listed below: (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Group Consultations</h3>
<p>— Dade</p>
<p>"Group weddings" have already been held many times, because this can save a lot of material resources, while still having a grand wedding, and can be personally certified by the mayor, so it is convenient for society, and a very large number of people participate in each session.</p>
<p>Medical treatment and marriage are equally important events in life, but some people become ill and cannot find a suitable doctor. Or, if one person has several kinds of diseases, they have to run around to seek treatment, wouldn't that waste a lot of material resources. Therefore, some people ideally want to gather famous doctors in Shanghai in one place to provide group consultations, so that patients no longer have the difficulty of searching, nor the waste of running around. Now, this ideal has actually been realized. This is the Wu Zhou Pharmacy, which has specially invited experts to design and equip complete consulting rooms in the main building of the main store. All internal and external departments are staffed by the top-notch doctors in Shanghai. The Wu Zhou main store building is located in the middle of the Four Horses Road, with very convenient transportation, and the consulting room is equipped with a prescription collection point. After the diagnosis, the prescription is immediately filled, and you can take it back to take the medicine. With such thoughtful service, patients will certainly find it convenient and will enthusiastically participate.</p>

<h3>A True Proof of Friendship</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>While Japanese Foreign Minister Sato delivered a speech on diplomatic policy in the House of Peers, our newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Chonghui, also issued a statement on policy toward Japan in Nanjing. However, Minister Wang's statement was more abstract and simpler than Foreign Minister Sato's. Nevertheless, it was his first time expressing opinions as a diplomat, and he could only outline the general direction of diplomatic policy, unable to provide detailed and specific explanations. This is indeed the appropriate stance for a diplomat.</p>
<p>The speeches given by former General Hayashi Senjūrō in the Diet and the remarks made by Naotake Satō after becoming Foreign Minister represent an important Japanese position and attitude toward foreign relations. Foreign Minister Wang's statement, made just hours after Satō announced a similar attitude in the House of Peers, revealed a new path and points of agreement in the diplomatic posture of the two countries, despite its abstract wording. It can be confidently stated that the two countries will engage in concrete negotiations based on the spirit of friendship and mutual benefit.</p>
<p>However, so-called friendship, equality, and mutual benefit cannot be used as empty words to evade responsibility; they must be based on facts. Now, we must observe whether Japan's friendship is genuine or feigned, whether its mutual benefit is real or merely lip service, and whether its equality is sincere or simply a facade. We must first look at the North China issue. If Japan is truly sincere and genuine, it should abolish the pseudo-organization in eastern Hebei, which is neither fish nor fowl; eliminate the Political Council of Hebei and Chahar, which infringes upon our national sovereignty; and dismantle the so-called special zone bordering China, Japan, and "Manchukuo," which violates China's territorial rights. Only by doing so can Japan demonstrate its genuine spirit of friendship. Otherwise, no matter how pleasing its pronouncements may be, they are nothing but empty words.</p>
<p>However, Foreign Minister Satō Naotake's speech in the House of Peers was not made rashly. The gist of his speech must have been approved by Prime Minister Hayashi Senjūrō, Army Minister Sugiyama Gen, and Navy Minister Mitsumasa Yonai. Ōkōchi's questions also seemed to have been agreed upon beforehand, providing Satō with an opportunity to deliver his speech. Judging from this, Satō Naotake's speech must have considerable value. It is not merely about uttering pleasantries to win the satisfaction and praise of the audience while disregarding the facts or allowing the facts to be completely contrary to the words. Given the Foreign Minister's position and the speech's widespread publicity, it should have considerable value.</p>
<p>Now that we have heard Foreign Minister Satō Naotake's grand pronouncements, we eagerly await to see the methods of so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and Japan's attitude toward North China. We will watch closely with anticipation.</p>
<p>Historical Story</p>
<h3>The Fisherman's Death</h3>
<p>— Chen Ruhui</p>
<p>The fisherman rowed his boat and sang:</p>
<p>“The sun has set,</p>
<p>But sorrow fills my heart;</p>
<p>The moon has risen,</p>
<p>Yet why haven't I crossed the river?”</p>
<p>Wu Zixu heard the song and knew the pursuers were far behind. He led Prince Sheng out of the reeds and to the riverbank. The fisherman's boat was indeed quietly waiting there. He picked up the prince and jumped into the boat. The fisherman turned the oars, and with a splash, the boat glided into the river.</p>
<p>The vast expanse of the river, shrouded in mist, concealed the opposite shore. The boat floated like a leaf, moving upstream. The fisherman's hair was gray, but he rowed like a strong man. Wu Zixu, who had been terrified day and night, finally felt at peace. None of them spoke. He and the prince stared at the fisherman rowing, who only focused on the rise and fall of his oars.</p>
<p>In less than two hours, they crossed the river, reaching the territory of Wu. Wu Zixu carried the prince ashore first. The fisherman secured the boat and followed. Before Wu Zixu could thank him, the fisherman said:</p>
<p>"General, you must be hungry. Let me fetch some food."</p>
<p>Wu Zixu watched the fisherman's hurried departure with suspicion. "He's running off so quickly. Could he be reporting us to someone to capture us? But why did he ferry us across the river? I should hide." He pulled the prince and hid in the reeds again.</p>
<p>Soon, the fisherman returned with a food basket, but they were nowhere to be seen on the riverbank. He thought, "They couldn't have gone far in just a moment. They must be hiding somewhere." He looked around, seeing only dense reeds swaying in the wind. "They're probably in here. Let me call them out." The fisherman sang:</p>
<p>"People in the reeds,</p>
<p>People in the reeds,</p>
<p>Are you just poor scholars in distress?</p>
<p>Why do you avoid me?"</p>
<p>Wu Zixu heard the call and peeked out, seeing only the fisherman. He led the prince out and took the food from the fisherman, quickly devouring it on the riverbank. He was deeply grateful to the fisherman and didn't know how to thank him. He thought for a moment and decided to take off his sword and give it to the fisherman. He said respectfully:</p>
<p>"Thank you, old man, for saving our lives and helping us escape the clutches of Chu. We will never forget this great kindness. But I have no gold or silver with me, only this sword for protection. Please accept it as a token of my gratitude..."</p>
<p>"Haha!" The fisherman's laughter interrupted him. He pushed the sword back with his left hand. "General Wu, you underestimate me. I saved you because you are a hero, not because you have this sword. Haha..."</p>
<p>The fisherman's cold laughter burned Wu Zixu's face. Wu Zixu held the sword, unsure what to do.</p>
<p>"General Wu, you know that the King of Chu has offered a reward for your capture. I didn't take it, so would I accept this sword? General, take the prince and go quickly. We'll meet again." The fisherman's solemn attitude and sharp words stunned Wu Zixu. Ashamed, he put away the sword, still staring blankly as the fisherman turned to leave. Suddenly, he remembered something and shouted:</p>
<p>"Old man, wait! May I ask your name, so I can repay your kindness in the future?"</p>
<p>The fisherman turned his head, but didn't answer, muttering to himself: "What repayment? That doesn't sound like a hero."</p>
<p>But Wu Zixu still didn't leave. He took a step forward, timidly saying:</p>
<p>"Then, old man—please don't tell anyone about me!"</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the fisherman turned around again, his face turning green with anger. He bit his trembling lip and glared at Wu Zixu before saying:</p>
<p>"General Wu, rest assured; I will die before revealing your whereabouts."</p>
<p>The fisherman boarded the boat. Seeing that Wu Zixu still wouldn't turn around, he angrily shouted:</p>
<p>"You must see me die to feel at ease? Fine! Fine! Fine! I didn't expect General Wu to be so petty."</p>
<p>Wu Zixu was startled and was about to explain when he saw the fisherman spread his arms, brace his feet against the gunwale, and with a single push, the boat capsized, trapping the fisherman underneath. A swift current swept away the man and the boat, disappearing into the twilight.</p>
<h3>The Secret Talk of Two Young Ladies</h3>
<p>— Shun</p>
<p>The door was tightly closed, and two young ladies were whispering inside!</p>
<p>Miss Jiang: I asked you on the road earlier why your complexion has become so sallow recently. Why didn't you tell me?</p>
<p>Miss Liu: It wasn't convenient to talk on the road. I'll tell you now. It's because my menstruation has been irregular for some time. I often feel weak in my lower back and legs, with abdominal distension and headaches. I didn't pay much attention to it. But recently, these symptoms have increased, causing me great physical and mental suffering! That's why my appearance looks so haggard!</p>
<p>Miss Jiang: Oh, so that's what it is. You just need to buy 'Yue Yue Hong' (Monthly Red) from the Wuzhou Pharmacy. It will regulate your menstruation, and you can regain your health and beauty.</p>
<p>Miss Liu: How do you know this medicine is so effective?</p>
<p>Miss Jiang: I used to suffer from difficult menstruation myself. Later, I relied on 'Yue Yue Hong' to cure my condition.</p>
<h3>The Uncrowned Emperor Maintains a Small Court in England</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>Tears fall as he surveys his lost kingdom, unable to bear the memories.</p>
<p>Haile Selassie, the Emperor of Abyssinia, hailed as the Lion of Judah, the King of Kings, currently resides in a grey stone house atop a small hill, ruling over an area of merely two acres. He once said frankly, "When a mortal is troubled, the place where he lives is indeed unsatisfactory." However, he remains as confident in his future as he was when he resided in Addis Ababa (the capital), still harboring the hope of restoring his imperial rule. Although his palace in Abyssinia has been occupied by Italian soldiers, he continues to maintain a small court in the English countryside. Among his few loyal courtiers, his words still carry the weight of law, but beyond the garden gate, he has no authority.</p>
<p>Since the King of Italy added the title of Emperor of Abyssinia to his name, the recent edition of the Gotha Almanac has removed several pages of the Abyssinian royal family. This uncrowned emperor currently resides quietly in a villa built on a steep hillside, overlooking the spa town of Bath. Surrounded by lush trees, it is very peaceful. He lives a secluded life, rarely appearing in public and seldom meeting with local society ladies. Those who wish to see him must still observe the formalities of a court audience, announcing themselves outside the door before being led by a seven-foot-tall guard into a large square room. The emperor, with a furrowed brow, spends his days in this room. A map of his ravaged kingdom hangs on the wall, shelves are filled with books, and documents are scattered on his desk. He often stands quietly by the window, gazing at the ancient city of Bath, built centuries ago by the ancestors of his enemies when they invaded England. In the next room, several of his staff members are typing letters. He is still spending his private funds to maintain Abyssinian embassies in London, Paris, and Geneva, keeping a steady flow of correspondence.</p>
<p>Although his guards have changed into smart Savile Row suits, he himself still wears a black robe, white trousers, and a flat cap, an outfit that has become familiar worldwide through newsreels. Since leaving Addis Ababa and fleeing abroad, his demeanor has not changed much. He still greets guests with familiarity, but he expects those introduced to him to address him as "Your Majesty."</p>
<p>An Associated Press reporter once visited him. He told the reporter, "I will never abandon my hope." He denied rumors of moving elsewhere in Europe, saying, "Since being forced to leave my country, the British have treated me very well. I have decided to stay here for now. I still hope to return to Abyssinia one day."</p>
<p>Although he acknowledged that the government of the Galla people no longer exists, he maintained that in areas not occupied by the Italian army, there is still an administrative organization representing the emperor. He said proudly, "In those territories, my people are still fighting to preserve their freedom." The reporter asked, "Would Your Majesty be willing to return to Abyssinia under Italian protection?" He shrugged and replied, "If the League of Nations so directs." The reporter then asked, "Does Your Majesty still believe in the League of Nations?" "We often hope to receive something somewhat satisfactory from the League of Nations," was his simple answer. The Emperor declined to discuss his financial situation, but it is generally believed that he has spent a considerable amount of money maintaining his embassies and retaining his staff. He recently sold a batch of silver in London, receiving about 2,500 British pounds. He spoke of this, saying that he was forced to take this step due to circumstances. He added, "I don't need money now, because there are no social obligations here."</p>
<h3>Lock</h3>
<p>— Shen Bing</p>
<p>I locked up my shabby trunk and pitiful drawers with careful locks. Every day, I held a string of clanging keys in my hand, feeling as triumphant as someone who possessed great wealth. However, locks represent humanity's shame, cunning, and sorrow.</p>
<p>My old rattan trunk held outdated short shirts, a woolen lined robe that my father gave me—my father's build was similar to mine, but it was too cramped for me—and all the clothes I had worn for everyday and social life over the years. Clothes eaten through by silverfish, scorched by cigarette butts. All permeated with the scent of mothballs, all permeated with ancient memories. Yet I had no careful intention when carefully locking the trunk.</p>
<p>My drawers were messy. Everything was temporary and haphazard. Every weekend, seeing the chaotic state of the drawers, I wrung my hands like an incompetent doctor. The ink bottle, forlornly thrown into a corner, wore a sorrowful face, complaining about the dust on its neck. The writing paper lamented its broken spine, dripping ink stains, and its fate in the despised wastebasket—the writing paper with its precisely cut, difficult-to-fill blank spaces. The incomplete inkstone, the crippled Huizhou inkstick, the bald brush that had shared joys and sorrows with me over the years, all glared at their master with resentment. Helplessly, I wrung my hands.</p>
<p>The shabby trunk and pitiful drawers were hidden away like precious silver.</p>

<p>Opening: "Bao Yu Mourns at the Funeral"</p>
<p>Fragrant smoke gently fills the incense burner. Dim and faint, the white candles flicker. The white spiritual canopy is hung high. The burning ingots and silk become ashes. The tall wooden tablet sits in the middle. The silent paper servants stand on both sides. Ash-covered sacrificial offerings. Cold and iced, a bowl of soup. A dark black five-foot coffin. The flashing seven lamps give a dim yellow light. Bitter, sad, sad, Zi Juan, the maid. Tearful eyes shed two rows of tears. The passionate son approaches, walking slowly. Sorrowful and melancholy, his heart is filled with sadness. Step by step, he enters the mourning hall. Sobbing, his voice cracks his heart. Softly, he calls out to Sister Lin. Listen carefully, I will tell you the details from the beginning. Our love was intimate as we read the Romance of the Western Chamber together. Our feelings were strong as we wrote poems together among the crabapple blossoms. Angrily, I buried the fallen flowers in the garden. Hastily, I came to comfort her sorrow. Wearily and sickly, her delicate body couldn't bear it. Exhausted and lost, she lay on her small ivory bed. Late at night, I visited her in the Xiaoxiang Pavilion. The fan blows by the stove, brewing medicinal soup. She always wished to be united in marriage. But fate was thin, and it all became a dream. Joyfully, flower candles were lit in the hall. Looking closely, little did she know that it was a substitute. Confused and dazed, she stood unsteadily. Her spirit wandering and drifting away. Resentfully, she hated Sister-in-law Er. Fiercely, her hands were ruthless, and her heart was poisonous. Wickedly, people's hearts are not ancient. Hypocritically, she deceived me into becoming the groom. Don't blame me for being too heartless. It's difficult to repay, difficult to prolong your life. In a vast expanse, you have already returned to the Yellow Springs. Crying, what incense can bring back the soul? Hair shaved, I wish to enter the empty gate. Far, far away, leaving behind the old hometown. Constantly, quietly listening to the sound of the wooden fish. Again and again, in the next life, may we be mandarin ducks. Heart sore, how can I think of everything? May your soul ascend to heaven. Heart filled with regret, I will spend my time in the monastery.</p>

<h3>Afterglow</h3>
<p>The Nightingale Art Society, silenced in the air due to the influence of objective circumstances, urgently wanted to revitalize itself. However, due to the constraints of the members' professions, it still could not be realized.</p>
<p>Since the Nightingale Art Society could not broadcast as desired, Manna and Lucy, who had long been loved by art enthusiasts, were unwilling to succumb to the threat of circumstances. Therefore, they gathered a group of art comrades and automatically formed the Manlu Art Society.</p>
<p>The organizational system of the Manlu Art Society is divided into: (1) Singing Group (2) Music Group (3) Drama Group (4) Literary Group. The four departments currently decided are: the Singing Group started broadcasting popular songs on the 8th at Linji Radio Station (KC 1220) from 9:05 PM to 9:50 PM every night.</p>
<p>What I want to tell readers here is that the Manlu Art Society is a purely art-oriented group, so they will have many more departments in the future. Feeling the need for collective research, they are now publicly recruiting several amateur male and female members. If comrades who love art are willing to participate, please send a detailed address to Gu Jialu, Hengmao Elementary School, Hengmao Lane, Eight Immortals Bridge, Shanghai.</p>
<p>The "Chinese Harmonica World," published by the Chinese Harmonica World Publishing House, Volume 3, Issue 2, was published yesterday. The publication has always been recognized by harmonica music lovers as the only harmonica music magazine in the country, so its sales have spread throughout the country. The content of this issue is even richer, with two famous songs: (1) Yu Yuxing's arrangement of "Allegro" (2) Bao Mingshan's arrangement of "Spring Song." The text includes Jin Yangzhi's "Harmony Playing Method," Yunlong's "Opening to the Study of Harmonica Music," Fu Shu's "The Origin of Opera," Chen Xin's "Theory of Tone Fusion," Song Tao's "Anecdotes and Appreciation of Music," and so on. Each article is extremely wonderful. The annual subscription fee for twelve issues, including postage, is only six jiao. The address of the publishing house is Lane 157, Anren Street, Xinbeimen, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Star Magazine</h3>
<p>"Gone With the Wind," directed by Zhang Shichuan and starring Hu Die, is ready and will begin filming as soon as "Street Angel," directed by Yuan Muzhi, is completed.</p>
<p>"Gone With the Wind" depicts a young widowed woman who, although unwilling to sacrifice her precious youth under the cannibalistic old ethics, is willing to sacrifice her happiness for the sake of great love—love for her deceased husband and love for her five-year-old daughter—and falls into this contradictory and inextricable painful situation. The story is extremely tortuous and tragic, and the script is by Professor Hong Shen.</p>
<p>Ms. Wu Jiamou, who was an actress at the Star Film Company ten years ago, visited the Star Company yesterday and made contact with her friends regarding the establishment of the Huai'an Cinema.</p>
<p>In Shen Xiling's "Crossroads," Zhao Dan plays a young man pursuing light and progress. After getting a job, he is not afraid of hardship and does extra work to the best of his ability. Colleagues, jealous, mock him: "You're working so hard, don't you want your life?" His reply is: "It's better to suffer than to have no food to eat." However, he still cannot keep his job and soon becomes unemployed again.</p>
<p>Zhou Xuan sang a "Longing Song" in "Street Angel," which was very beautiful. It expressed her melancholy of "being a young woman alone, still without a husband."</p>
<h3>The Grand Light Presents "The Mystery of the Foggy Night Rescue"</h3>
<p>Comparable to "The Mystery of the Foggy Night Corpse" starring Coleen Moore</p>
<p>Many fans still remember, two years ago, Coleen Moore starred in a film called "The Mystery of the Foggy Night Corpse," which caused a sensation when it was released in Shanghai. Now, this story of "The Mystery of the Foggy Night Rescue," Bulldog Drummond Escapes, follows the plot of "The Mystery of the Foggy Night Corpse," telling how the great detective nicknamed "Mad Dog" Drummond, on a foggy night in London, solves two bizarre cases and rescues a beautiful woman. It is even more thrilling and bizarre than "The Mystery of the Foggy Night Corpse." The stars of this film are LeMyrun, the star of "Queen of the Jungle," Sir C. Aubrey Smith, and Zita Johann, produced by Paramount Pictures, and will be released at the Grand Light Theater starting today.</p>
<h3>"Song of a Loving Mother"</h3>
<p>A new model for ethical films</p>
<p>Those with filial piety can watch "Song of a Loving Mother" and examine themselves without shame, knowing how to improve themselves. Those who are naturally rebellious can watch "Song of a Loving Mother" and be warned to improve quickly and become complete people. It gives people moral enlightenment and artistic comfort.</p>
<p>The performance of "Song of a Loving Mother" is done in a very popular form, like casual conversation, while the story is winding and touching, making it easy for every audience member to accept.</p>
<p>There is also a famous Western film called "Mother," which caused a worldwide sensation and was welcomed by people all over the world. Audiences who have seen the Western film "Mother" should especially watch "Song of a Loving Mother," because "Song of a Loving Mother" is written entirely with Eastern colors and Chinese sentiments, making it more considerate and delicate than the film "Mother."</p>
