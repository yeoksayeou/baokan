<h3>中央秘書處負責者談國大兩法修正意義</h3>
<p>採取更民主的原則　聚集人才制定憲法</p>
<p>［南京］關於修正國民大會組織法、及代表選舉法、業經中央常會公布、交立法院、中央社記者、頃特向中央秘書處方面、探詢一切、據負責者談此次修正之經過及意義如下、查本年二月間、三中全會關於國民大會已作原則上之指示、其要點為㊀督促該管機關繼續辦理選舉、於今年十一月十二日召開國民大會、制定憲法、並决定憲法施行日期、㊁關於國民大會組織法及代表選舉法、其有應行修正之處、授權常務委員會辦理、㊂所有關於國民大會之提案、均交常務委員會參考等項、常務委員會奉到是項决議、經將所有關於國民大會之各方意見、愼重考慮、詳密研究、先後集議達十餘次之多、始得有最近常會之决議、此項原則上之决議、卽將交付立法院、依據修正各有關法規、以便於最近期間公布施行、俾得準於今年七三月十二日召集國民大會也、按此次修正案之精神、簡言之、欲採取更民主的原則、以聚集全國各方之人材、造成、</p>
<p>憲政開始時</p>
<p>之良好基礎、以建立三民主義之國家、故㊀於代表選舉法原定區域職業等選舉、由國民政府指定候選人之規定、一律取消、俾全國公民得有最大之自由、就已推定之初選當選人、選舉其所認為適當之代表、政府原有之指定權、因此取消、但又恐有才學醇正之專家、輿論所孚之老成、及為國奮鬬卓著成績之人士、未必全能獲得各地公民之認識、而予以選出、若擯棄會外、必將為國家前途之損失、故於選舉法第二條中、增加一項、卽“由國民政府指定二百四十名”、以</p>
<p>濟選舉之窮</p>
<p>名額雖有增加、亦不外集中人才、庶幾野無遺賢之微意也、又如各特種選舉、或以區域遼闊、散處各地、選舉困難、或以僑居他國、辦理選舉為當地政府所不容、中央迭據各方告訴、選舉每感極端困難、若不於選舉方法酌予變通、則特種選舉、將有不能依法產生之苦、為顧全事實計、故此次决定“第四章各種特種選舉、如無法舉行選舉、其代表得由國民政府指定之”亦所以濟事實上之困難、凡此均為修正代表選舉法之由來也、㊁此次三中全會、旣决定於今年十一月十二日召開國民大會、為制定憲法、並决定憲法施行日期、常會卽據以修正國民大會組織法第一條、至其他自憲政開始、以至完成之重要事件、中央與到會代表、自</p>
<p>可依法討論</p>
<p>、第一條下半段原尚有“行使憲法所賦予之職權”之規定、因三中全會此項决議、自不能繼續存在、此次擬增加“本屆國民大會、於會期完畢任務終了”一條、卽第一條修正後之當然的結論、附帶修正應行刪去之憲法草案第一百四十六條、“第一屆國民大會之職權、由制定憲法之國民大會行使之、”因與此次三中全會之决議、顯然衝突、故宜明文刪去、且憲法草案係中央常會所决定之原則、故可仍由常會决議加以修正也、餘如第三四條兩條排列不甚醒目、乃更由性質上別行排定、凡中央委員不論候補與否、因當此訓政期間、饒有代行政權之經騐、一律得出席國民大會</p>
<p>為當然代表</p>
<p>以佐大會制成憲法、政府長官仍以列席為宜、至國府主席、為國家元首、於國民大會中、自有其特殊之地位、故不應明定於出席或列席之中、此修正國民大會組織法之意義也、總之、此次修正案之精神、除遵照三中全會决議及補救事實之缺陷外、莫不以羅致全國人才、集中心思才力、以制定建國憲法為目的、故一方使全國公民得自由選舉、更設法羅致遺賢、以充實大會之本身、期於全國上下、精誠團結、凡此决議、當荷全國同胞之贊同與擁護、深盼全國上下、共體此意、以促其實現也、（廿四日中央社電）</p>

<h3>後套的移墾事業</h3>
<p>— 顧頡剛</p>
<p>生長江南的人一談起綏遠，總有極遠極寒苦的感想，因而覺得那邊和自己無關；要是不經這次英勇的戰爭怕就沒有多人去注意。其實平綏路通後，從上海去只消三天，哪裏說得上遠。寒苦呢，我有一年四月初去，關內早已花紅柳綠而那邊還是冰雪未融，似乎可以證實了這句話；但後來夏天去時，黑壓壓的森林和碧油油的禾黍，加上縱橫環繞着的河流，風景不殊江南，比了河北河南等省肥沃得多，就逼我取消了這個成見而注意到那邊開墾的情形來；等到一注意，就不由得不受這些創業人物的刻苦精神的感動了。</p>
<p>什麼呌後套？黃河從事夏過來是一直向北的，到了綏遠的臨河縣界便又轉而向東，到流入山陝間時又向南了，這一個略帶長方形的圈子呌作河套。諺有之，“黃河百害，惟富一套”，河套原是最好的農耕區域，黃河初入綏境時本來歧分為北河和南河兩支，到了清初，北河上流淤塞，這殘存的一段稱為烏加河，從此只有南河是黃河正流。河套地方因此可以畫成兩部；黃河之南稱為前套，黃河之北稱為後套。後套的地土比前套更好，而且開渠之後，從黃河裏進了水，可以退入烏加河，灌溉很是便利，所以更適宜於種植。</p>
<p>這一帶地方，在東周時已伸入了秦晋的勢力。到秦始皇時就佔有了全套，他在那邊設立了九原郡和許多縣，又移民殖邊。其後中原紛擾，匈奴內侵；直到漢武帝時又奪了回來，設置朔方五原諸郡，大舉移民，開鑿渠道，西北邊防因此鞏固。可惜中國政府的力量不能永遠保住這塊肥美之地，北方的游牧部落常常跑進來，已墾之地一到他們手裏很容易變成荒蕪的草原。明朝本來佔有河套，不料到築長城時把整個套地築在城外，就默默地丟了。但是這樣一個適宜耕種的地方是埋沒不了它的光彩的到清中葉以後，河北山西等處的漁戶，商人和農夫等都靠了一手一足的力量開闢草萊，在寂寞的原野中建立起他們的家業。到光緒初年，王同春仗着他的英雄的才路和創造的聰明，察地勢，辨十壤，鑿溝渠，用盡了他的畢生精力來經營這塊地方，於是渠道縱橫，稷菽遍野，後套就成了他的一個富庶的王國，四方流民歸依他的不知有多少。不幸他這一開發，激起了清政府的注意，便派貽榖督辦綏遠墾務，官辦事業總容易有流弊的，王同春的天才被限制了，人民辛苦得來的權利也被剝削了，弄得河道失修，墾業停滯。雖說如此，究竟王氏的功績是巍然不朽的，綏遠的西部在先全歸薩拉齊廳管理，而從這時到民國，由薩拉齋析出了安北，五原，臨河三個新縣，這三縣地方便是王同春用了他個人的力量開發的後套，值得後人永遠紀念。</p>
<p>歐洲的天主敎徒在綏遠傳敎已有八十年的歷史。當內地義和團騷動時，綏遠的蒙民也起響應，殺死了幾個敎徒，事平賠欵，敎堂中就用這一筆錢鑿了一條黃士拉亥渠，墾了許多荒地，增設了許多敎堂。因為神父們不怕見官，敎堂裏可以避兵災和匪亂，所以一般農民相率歸附。到現在，臨河縣敎民所有的田地幾乎佔了全縣的一半。那邊的人民可以只認得敎會，不和政府發生關係了。</p>
<p>十餘年前，張相文王鴻一等都曾到後套辦過移墾事業，但或因匪亂，或因管理不善，都失敗了。到現在，不厭不倦做開發的工作而有成功的希望的共有四個團體，讓我順了他們創立的次序說下去。</p>
<p>民國十八年，閻錫山捐欵六萬元在薩拉齊縣城東南開辦新農試騐塲，他的目的是試行大農制，試立新農村。他聘金陵大學農學院敎員任承統等管理致全力於機器農具的試騐，結果固然是節時省工，可是消耗的油料的價錢就高出於當地人工和牛馬價值之上，在工資低廉的社會裏是不合經濟原則的，所以只得仍用舊法開荒而以機器補人工的不足。後來受政局影響，經費無着。工作人員以事業為重，甘心犧牲，他們擬定十年建設計劃，以前五年為開荒期，後五年為建設新村期。在這十年之內，常年經費由生產收入項下開支，嬴餘則作分紅和推廣費；而把閻氏和省政府所給的經費作為貸欵，在新村建設完成後分期償還。現在墾民有二百戶，一千人，墾地有二百餘頃，還有二十頃圃田，種苜蓿供畜牧。</p>
<p>二十年，閻錫山傅作義等設立綏區屯墾督辦辦事處，撥兵四團，又為救濟失業軍官計，招募軍官屯墾三隊，開往五原臨河屯墾，分作十五個鄉，散佈的區域甚廣。因為資力豐厚，設備甚為完善。閻氏本倡土地村有之制，正好借這墾區作實地的試騐。</p>
<p>二十二年，黃河下流潰决，河北南部長垣等縣受災甚慘，段承澤聯合谷鍾秀等發起河北移民協會，選移百戶到包頭墾殖。段氏本任師長，偶游河套，跋踄在數百里無人烟的草原中，驀然間見有樹木葱蘢集居數百戶的城堡，一問是外國敎士所經營的，這樣有好多處，一處處都像獨立國家，人民也都安居樂業。他受的刺戟太大了，心想中國人為什麼不能，便於十八年脫離軍人生活，到包頭開設麫粉公司，又試種稻米，很有成績；到這時就把移民成立河北新村，每戶授田一頃。二十四年，又移民到五原，組織明軒鄉，當他剛辦移民時很有謠言說他騙招兵士，良民裹足不前；但到移來後一年農民向老家匯去銀錢時，那地人的心理就大變了，到現在每年移一批去時大家踴躍報名了。他是想把敎育做中心組成新社會的，所以在他的新村裏用的新式敎育方法有許多樣。</p>
<p>九一八事變後，東北人流亡到關內來的好些找不到出路，二十三年，朱霽靑等組織西北移墾委員會，由任作田主持，移民到安北的和碩公中，墾田約二百頃。墾區的東邊就是烏梁素海，是絕好的漁獵所在。他們是集團生產的組織，以五年為試騐期，在這期內，共同生產，共同消費，有了嬴餘也公分：因為這樣，他們的組織很嚴密，生活極紀律化，個人的動作處處受團體的支配，沒有什麼自由。</p>
<p>看了以上的簡述，可知他們的組織雖不同，郤無一不充滿了創造和苦幹的精神。他們的工作已不止於墾荒而進一步從事於新社會組織的嘗試。他們是先驅者，試騐結果不好他們自己犧牲，試騐得好便讓後人受用了，這種精神的偉大是值得我們贊歎的。</p>
<p>然而單是贊歎他們的工作是不够的，我們還要責望政府和專家對他們協助。後套有極好的土地而不能盡其地力，這就是所謂“貨棄於地”。但如何而能使地盡其利這非在一個大計劃之下共同進行不可。假使政府方面能少設機關以减輕農民的担負，發展交通以運銷農民的生產，獎勵公私移民使內地勤勞而不能自給的貧農可有安身之地，收買大地主的土地用廉價賣給佃農使他們可以升作自耕農，那麼開發的程度必然超過現階段。假使許多專門人才肯為中華民族的生存而捨棄了都市的繁榮生活，投身於這開荒的工作，出其技術以改良農具，廣修水利，豫防疾疫，增多生產，又就土壤的性質以規定其用途，哪裏該作耕區，哪裏該作牧區，哪裏該作林區，又就實際的需要而給與敎育，使得那邊的農民有精神的安頓和正當的志向，那麼這個新開發的地區就馬上變成一個理想的社會了。</p>
<p>如何可使後套的移墾事業不蹈清末的覆轍而繼續繁榮，不但解决若干墾民的生活問題而且充實了西北的國防，不但充實了西北的國防而且作新社會組織的試騐以解决將來的民生問題？這是極重要的一件事，願這文的讀者都肯去想一想！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>刦後餘生的太平景象</h3>
<p>— 乃一</p>
<p>桮棬先生的“滇程拾遺”云：“吾們今晚雖然打擾孔先生一宿，但是廟貌因吾們過境為之一新，孔先生對吾們當然不會見外的。（蓋萬載招待與刷新市容，省當軸出三千元，地方出二千元，以刦後之城鎮，要人民負擔二千元，却是很够受的了）。”又云：“學術團體之週覽，與中央政府吏之地方視察，逡巡往來，極尋常事，最好不要地方供應，因供應而勞動民衆，壯丁排列二三百里，是勞民也。尤期是農忙時期，片刻黃金，雖然省當局要好太過，然在民衆是一種大損失，卽在受之者，亦覺汗顏慙赧，咸露瑟縮狀態；至於徵集民夫，搬運行李，未聞給值，尤覺不安；他如燃放鞭砲十餘萬響，這種消耗，向誰取償？……今遇此“布爾喬亞”團過境之供張，豈不要平添幾分不良印象麼？”（見二十四日本報）</p>
<p>桮棬先生的意見是極是的“最好不要地方供應”，一豈不要平添幾分不良印象麼？”更是從心坎裹說出來的話。我則以為還不至此。這次政府所以發起京滇的週遊，他的最大意義，應該是考察沿途民生的疾苦，和建設的情况；而加入遊覽的諸君呢，他們的目的自然也應跟普通的遊山玩景不同，當然更不是想享受“壯丁排列二三百里”“鞭砲十餘萬響”的歡迎而去，反之，他們想看的，也應該是看到一些切實的絕無粉飾雕琢的各地民衆的生活。</p>
<p>然而現在週覽團到處，鞭砲之聲也隨之；週覽團諸君坐臥之處，俱經粉飾一新招待遊覽，俱經排定次序，規定地點；本來在田野間或許還可以看到一點耕作情形，現在則因為“要好太過”，在“片刻黃金的農忙時期”，也呌勞動民衆“排列二三百里”來充作夾道歡迎的脚色了。這樣，本來面目未見，而刦後餘生则徒增“打腫了脸充胖子”之苦。而對於欲考察沿途民生實况的，又有何益？</p>
<p>然則靠此急來抱佛脚的粉飾，就能使週覽團諸君認為是太平世界的反映嗎？也不大可能，“沿途壯丁，因營養缺乏，面多菜色，猶帶數年前封鎖區憔悴餘容，”旣見乎“拾遺”，而不久前聞前綫有匪警因而停車半小時的事情也有過，現在則更是“因隔夜聞萬瀏交界處，有携槍團衆百餘過境，未識是民是匪，當由軍隊一團先期開往警戒；”可見這沿途歡迎的“盛况”，也實在頗有戲台上“跑龍套”意味，一旦剝下外面那件彩衣，裏面瘦骨嶙峋，就祇一件骯髒萬分的破棉襖。</p>
<p>地方政府對中央政府所組織的週覽團體，加以招待，予以便利，聊盡地主之誼，原是要的。然而，這招待，這歡迎，應該是非常誠懇的把治下的種種實况，告訴給來賓，讓他們明瞭苦處，也讓他們知道好處，卽使有不好的地方，也儘不妨說明原委，以及以後改進的計劃，庶幾能使考察者看清本來面目，將來或者有何意見貢獻；若一味加以粉飾，而事實上又掩飾不過來，則恐怕所見者不但連掩飾者看做一錢不值，就是好處，也將看做破棉襖中的敗絮也。</p>
<h3>倫敦女扮男裝奇案</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>倫敦瑪爾波羅街警務法庭近曾審訊一件竊案，那被告是一個喬扮男裝的女子，並且還曾跟另一女子結婚為夫婦。她名呌史密士，年四十二歲，在倫敦史考特家充當僕人，被控竊取女主人所有的每張一鎊的紙幣五張。她自認犯罪，法庭判她繳罰欵二十先令，並付訟費五鎊完案。她到庭的時候，穿着藍色的男大衣，褐色呢的女袴，戴着黑氈的女帽。她請了柯爾曼律師為辯護人，原告的律師是文恩氏。</p>
<p>據文恩律師在庭上聲稱：“史考特夫人去年八月間在報上登載廣告，招僱男僕一名，史密斯便來自薦，自稱原有妻室，現已故世，並有前主人所給的服務勤勞證書，史考特夫人認為滿意，便僱定了。當時全家都以為史密士是個男子，毫無疑心。史密士平日工作，極為周到，很得主人的歡心。本年三月十四日，史考特夫人放在臥室的錢袋中，忽少紙幣五張，便向史密士盤問，史密士起初不認行竊，後來却承認了。”</p>
<p>次據偵探頭目供稱：“被告在一九一八年四月間跟澳洲軍隊中的史密士中尉結婚，只同居了六個月。後來她跟澳洲的一個兵士克羅樞同居，有私生子兩個。一九二三年她跟克羅樞分離，前往白拉頓，跟一位賀威特女士同住在旅館中，那時已改男裝，自稱維克托爵士，女士却稱巴克夫人。直到一九二九年四月十六日，她因為結婚登記時曾作謊言，事情發覺，被中央刑事法庭判處徒刑八個月。原來她在一九二三年十一月間用維克托巴克的姓名跟賀威特女士結婚為夫婦，一九二六年由白拉頓前往安杜佛，却把爵士的銜號除去改用“大尉”的銜號，她倆開了一個舊木器店。巴克大尉並曾加入當地棒球俱樂部，又會騎馬出獵，毫未露出女性的破綻。被告又曾加入康浦培爾夫人戲劇公司，充男藝員演了幾齣戲。一九二五年她冒稱維克托巴克爵士的當兒，因欠男子服裝欵四十鎊，被債主控告，法庭判令分十二個月拨還，一九二六年初，她得到恩克菲爾特田莊經理的職位，不多時，便辭去，後來她便跟賀威特女士分離。一九二七</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>年初，她用巴克大尉的名稱參加根辛頓全國法西斯運動，她身穿戎裝，胸佩軍事徽章，她又在法西斯團一個主要機關充當秘書。荷迦資路法西斯總部被搜查後，她因違犯武裝法令，被傳至法庭。一九二七年七月十一日，她在中央刑事法庭被控犯罪兩欵，㊀引用假文據希圖朦混，㊁希圖欺騙，後來因證據不足，判决無罪，在這個當兒，她用布紥住眼部，由一個友人扶至庭上，據説，巴克大尉曾在戰時受傷，雙目暫時失明，醫士曾囑告“他”，神經稍受激刺，便會舊病復發。不多時，她的哥哥故世，得到這産約一千鎊，她便在赫特福西街租了一層房屋，跟一女優同居，稱為夫婦。一九二八年一月，她改稱巴克大佐，開設咖啡館，但因營業不佳，後來發生破産訟案。一九二八年九月十五日，她在攝政宫旅館充招待員，每星期薪水五鎊，後來被小賬股職員拘捕，才離開這個職業。一九三二年二月，她由一家汽車經理公司僱用，到了七月間，因為裁員被辭退，她在職時，兜攬生意，很為岀力，所以經理很器重她。一九三四年初期，她跟一個女子一個孩子同住在攝政公園某屋，人們都以為那是“他”的妻兒。她因為積欠當地商店七十金鎊，忽然遷去。這年她改名希爾，前往海恩菲爾特，在一家狗苑服務，因為濫飲，被主人辭退，後來在一家養鷄塲覔到一個職業，又因不滿主人之意，而被辭退，後來又曾充司頭目。她在坎姆登鎮時，曾自稱希爾爵士，行走時，拄着拐杖，據説，因為戰時腿部受傷，步履不便的原故。直到她在史考特夫人家裏充當男僕，才被發覺她是個女性。”</p>
<p>問官至此，便問道：“她喬裝男子，是岀於怪癖呢？還是别有用意呢？</p>
<p>文恩律師回答道：“我們却不知道，她喬裝已有多年了。</p>
<p>被告律師柯爾曼於是上前説道：“被告從前只犯過一次罪，完全跟本案没有關係，她承認曾取史考特夫人的紙幣。她在夫人家裏工作，極為勤勞，到了去年十二月間，她因為害病，欠了許多醫藥費，因此異常窘困。假使她貪財，早可偷得更大的數目，她到萬不得已時，才起了歹心。至於她改裝男子，她曾告訴我確有一種理由，在這時不願宣露。假使我能把這個理由告知庭上，一定會對她表示同情的。”</p>
<p>問官説道：“她改裝男子這件事，我不必追究。”於是他便對被告史密士發言道：“你自承曾偷取紙幣五鎊，那是我應該審判的案件。剛才偵探頭目詳細説明你的履歷，使我覺得你是一個勤苦耐勞的女子。你是為了手頭支絀，才行竊的，許多淸白良民，也曾遭遇過跟你相同的命運。你平生只犯了一次説謊登記罪，却跟行竊全然不同。假使你以後能設法覔得一種更誠實的工作，正正當當做一個女子，不要再像現在喬裝男子。你可去見見女試用員，我想她一定會盡力帮助你的。</p>
<h3>雨</h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>懷着一個侥倖底心輕輕地掀開窗帷，是陰沉的天，雨點像遊絲似的打在玻璃窗上，明净的玻璃就彷彿车辙那樣混亂起來；同时，擾亂了我的心。</p>
<p>“又是下雨。它將繼續到什麼時候呢？”</p>
<p>心底私語着。合上了窗帷，希望它遠遠地隔離我。</p>
<p>我希望有一個晴天！</p>
<p>屋子是湫溢的，從下雨的那天，我就沒有撕過壁上的日曆，—那邊去的日子更顯得灰黯了。</p>
<p>寫字椅里的雨衣倦伏着像一個蝸牛，在三天之前，我曾穿了它，走過遙遠的路程去探訪一個朋友的病。</p>
<p>—他躺在一張狹小的行軍床上，面色蒼白地，像那灰黯的天空。他氣喘着告訴我；病將近一個星期了，沒有一個探望的人，也沒有請過大夫診治。那個有着菩薩心腸的二房東，每天為他煮一罐粥，用那粗糙的手掌測量他額角上的熱度。</p>
<p>—有時，一顆心像放在油鍋里煎炙，渾身如一個將爆發的炸彈；有時，又跌到冰窖里去，血液都停止了循環似的。</p>
<p>—“我想回家去！”母親會把我摟在懷里，呼着我的乳名；姊姊會講一個故事給我聽；爸爸卽使憤恨我不肯聽從他的話，但是他會替我請一個大夫的。</p>
<p>—“我要回家去！”</p>
<p>我坐在他的對面，聽着他的訴說，我已經忘了用友誼的熱情去安慰他，我忘了是來探望一個可憐的友人的病的。</p>
<p>在他睡熟的時候，我偷偷地逃了出來。</p>
<p>雨繼續下着，天空織着一張飄忽的網。我沿着荒凉的路，踽踽獨行。讓冰冷的雨點打在我焦炙的額上，讓無情的雨點侵蝕着我的將破碎的雨衣。時候已經是黃昏了，我走着歸家的相反的路途。</p>
<p>街燈亮了，我才注意到街旁的白楊在雨絲中抽出嫩綠的枝葉，它飛舞着，又像向我頷首。</p>
<p>“回家去吧，我也有個溫暖的家！”</p>
<p>—田野是翠綠的，遠得的山峯在如烟的雨絲中隱忽着。一個戴䇹笠帽，穿蓑衣的農夫，剛從籪上滿載了鮮魚，沿着魚塘，如飛地跑來，將近家門的時候，喊着他妻子的名字，快到鎮上去打一斤酒。</p>
<p>—晚餐中有一尾鮮肥的大魚。他喝過了二盅酒，用靑竹筷指着魚說：</p>
<p>—“今年雨水好，塘里的魚旺啊大家吃一點…”</p>
<p>—“田里也可下秧了，這樣好雨水，不怕又是個熟年！”</p>
<p>—聽雨聲打在茅屋頂上，睡下去有一個綺麗的夢。</p>
<p>我終於回到了家。脫去了淋漓的雨衣，摔在寫字椅里，納頭躺到床上，不曉得自己吃過了晚飯沒有。</p>
<p>終夜沒有睡熟，那飄忽的雨彷彿錘着我的心一樣。</p>
<p>它將繼續到什麼時候呢？</p>
<p>我希望有一個晴天！</p>

<h3>Those in Charge of the Central Secretariat Discuss the Significance of the Amendments to the National Assembly Laws</h3>
<p>Adopting More Democratic Principles to Gather Talent and Formulate a Constitution</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the amendments to the National Assembly Organization Law and the Representative Election Law, which have been announced by the Central Standing Committee and handed over to the Legislative Yuan, a Central News Agency reporter recently inquired about everything with the Central Secretariat. According to those in charge, the process and significance of this amendment are as follows: In February of this year, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee made principled instructions regarding the National Assembly. The main points were: ㊀ Supervise the relevant agencies to continue handling the election and convene the National Assembly on November 12 this year to formulate a constitution and decide on the date of implementation of the constitution. ㊁ Regarding the National Assembly Organization Law and the Representative Election Law, any amendments that should be made are authorized to the Standing Committee for handling. ㊂ All proposals regarding the National Assembly will be submitted to the Standing Committee for reference. After receiving these resolutions, the Standing Committee carefully considered and thoroughly studied all opinions from various parties regarding the National Assembly and held more than ten meetings before reaching the recent resolution of the Standing Committee. This principled resolution will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to amend the relevant laws and regulations so that they can be announced and implemented in the near future, so that the National Assembly can be convened on July 12 this year. In short, the spirit of this amendment is to adopt more democratic principles in order to gather talents from all over the country and create</p>
<p>a good foundation for the beginning of constitutional government</p>
<p>in order to establish a nation of the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, ㊀ the original regulations in the Representative Election Law for regional, professional, and other elections, whereby the National Government designated candidates, have been completely abolished so that citizens nationwide can have the greatest freedom to elect the representatives they deem appropriate from the already nominated candidates in the preliminary election. The original designation power of the government has thus been abolished. However, fearing that experts with talent and integrity, veterans trusted by public opinion, and people who have made outstanding achievements in fighting for the country may not all be recognized by citizens in various regions and elected, it would be a loss for the future of the country if they were excluded from the meeting. Therefore, an item was added to Article 2 of the Election Law, namely "The National Government designates 240 people" in order to</p>
<p>alleviate the shortcomings of the election.</p>
<p>Although the number of seats has increased, it is nothing more than concentrating talent, hoping to prevent neglecting any worthy people. For special elections, such as those due to vast areas, dispersed locations, difficulty in elections, or residence in other countries where elections are not allowed by local governments, the Central Government has repeatedly received reports from various parties that elections are extremely difficult. If the election methods are not changed, special elections will suffer from the inability to produce results in accordance with the law. In order to take into account the facts, it was decided this time that "In Chapter 4 on various special elections, if it is impossible to hold elections, the representatives may be designated by the National Government." This is also in order to alleviate the difficulties in fact. All of these are the origins of the amendment to the Representative Election Law. ㊁ Since the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12 this year to formulate a constitution and decide on the date of implementation of the constitution, the Standing Committee amended Article 1 of the National Assembly Organization Law accordingly. As for other important events from the start of constitutional government to its completion, the Central Government and the representatives attending the meeting, of course,</p>
<p>can discuss them in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>The original provision in the second half of Article 1, "Exercise the powers conferred by the constitution," cannot continue to exist due to the decision of the Third Plenary Session. This time, it is planned to add the article "The current National Assembly will end its mission upon completion of its term," which is a natural conclusion after the amendment of Article 1. The accompanying amendment should delete Article 146 of the draft constitution, "The powers of the first National Assembly shall be exercised by the National Assembly that formulates the constitution," because it clearly conflicts with the decision of the Third Plenary Session. Therefore, it should be expressly deleted, and the draft constitution is a principle decided by the Central Standing Committee, so the Standing Committee can still decide to amend it. For example, the arrangement of Articles 3 and 4 is not very eye-catching, so they are rearranged according to their nature. All members of the Central Committee, whether candidates or not, because they have the experience of exercising administrative power during this period of political tutelage, are all allowed to attend the National Assembly</p>
<p>as ex officio representatives</p>
<p>in order to assist the conference in formulating a constitution. Government officials should still be invited to attend as observers. As for the Chairman of the National Government, as the head of state, he has a special position in the National Assembly, so he should not be explicitly stated in the attendance or observer list. This is the significance of the amendment to the National Assembly Organization Law. In general, the spirit of this amendment, in addition to complying with the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session and remedying factual defects, is aimed at recruiting talents from all over the country and concentrating thoughts and efforts in order to formulate a constitution for national construction. Therefore, on the one hand, it allows citizens nationwide to freely elect, and on the other hand, it tries to recruit hidden talents to enrich the assembly itself, hoping that the whole country will unite with sincerity. All of these resolutions should be endorsed and supported by the people of the whole country, and it is deeply hoped that the whole country will understand this intention and promote its realization.

<h3>Sichuan Province Urgently Raises 2 Million Yuan for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Cao Zhongzhi is Responsible for Inspection and Distribution; Scheduled to be Completed Within 25 Days</p>
<p>[Chengdu] The Sichuan disaster is extremely severe, and urgent relief is difficult to delay. The Central Government has allocated funds to be handled by the Relief Committee and the Ministry of Finance jointly with the Sichuan Provincial Government. The Central Government has previously remitted 710,000 yuan. Zhu Qinglan requested another appropriation to raise 1 million yuan. The Provincial Government will raise another 1 million yuan, totaling 2 million yuan. After consultation between Zhu Qinglan and Liu Xiang, it was decided to promote Cao Zhongzhi, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, to be responsible for the overall inspection and distribution. Cao will select inspection and distribution personnel and set off separately to various counties with severe disasters to inspect the disaster and distribute funds. Cao will personally inspect the disaster areas within days and plans to complete the work within 25 days of departure so that the dying victims can be saved.

<h3>"The Good Earth" Movie to be Released Soon</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "The Good Earth" film began production in 1933. The film was originally intended to be based on the story in Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth," but our deputy consul in Los Angeles, because there were many insults to the Chinese nation in the book, consulted with the company and deleted them. The embassy in the United States telegraphed and obtained the permission of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education after consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but it was stated that it should be handled in accordance with the regulations for foreign filmmakers in China. In December of that year, the company sent personnel to China to take outdoor scenes. The Central Propaganda Committee, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the US Embassy, and the company's representatives repeatedly contacted each other, and as a result, the company and the Central Propaganda Committee exchanged letters, and the main points were determined as follows: ㊀ The film should praise China. ㊁ China may send representatives to monitor the filming. ㊂ The company should accept any suggestions from the Chinese representatives as much as possible. ㊃ If China wants to insert a preface at the beginning of the film, the company should do so immediately. ㊄ The films taken in China should be allowed to be exported only after inspection. ㊅ It is hoped that all the actors in the film will be Chinese. Then, the Central Propaganda Committee sent Du Tingxiu to the United States as the film's instructor, and later, after consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior, changed to Huang Chaoqin to replace the instructor. In October 1936, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the film editing had come to an end and submitted reports for reference. In January of this year, it was approved by the Central Propaganda Department to be released in the United States first, limited to 40 days to transport the film to China for inspection. In summary, the filming of the film, from the initial discussion to the completion, lasted more than three years. The company paid much attention to the first, second, third, and fifth items of the conditions originally agreed with the Central Propaganda Committee when shooting the film, which was difficult. However, the sixth item, all actors are Chinese, was approved by the Central Propaganda Department to be changed. As for the fourth item, the preface to the film, our country considered it unnecessary to print it, so it was not inserted. Now the film has been inspected and approved by the Central Film Inspection Committee and will be released soon. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Reclamation Undertaking in Houtao</h3>
<p>— Gu Jiegang</p>
<p>People who grow up in Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) always have the impression that Suiyuan (Inner Mongolia) is extremely remote and harsh, so they feel that it has nothing to do with them. If it weren't for this heroic war, perhaps not many people would pay attention to it. In fact, after the PingSui Railway (Beijing-Suiyuan) opened, it only takes three days to go from Shanghai, so how can it be said to be remote? As for harshness, I went there once in early April. The flowers were already blooming in Guannei (areas within the Great Wall), but the ice and snow there had not yet melted, which seemed to confirm this statement. But when I went there later in the summer, the dark forests and the green millet, plus the crisscrossing rivers, made the scenery no different from Jiangnan and much more fertile than Hebei and Henan provinces. This forced me to abandon this prejudice and pay attention to the reclamation situation there. Once I paid attention, I couldn't help but be moved by the hard work of these pioneering figures.</p>
<p>What is Houtao (Rear Bend)? The Yellow River has been flowing north since the Xia Dynasty. When it reaches the Linhe County boundary in Suiyuan, it turns east again, and when it flows into the area between Shanxi and Shaanxi, it turns south again. This slightly rectangular circle is called the HeTao (River Bend). As the saying goes, "The Yellow River is a hundred harms, but the River Bend is the only wealth." The River Bend was originally the best agricultural area. When the Yellow River first entered the territory of Suiyuan, it originally diverged into two branches, the North River and the South River. In the early Qing Dynasty, the upper reaches of the North River were silted up, and this remaining section was called the Wujia River. From then on, only the South River was the main stream of the Yellow River. Therefore, the River Bend area can be divided into two parts: the south of the Yellow River is called Qiantao (Front Bend), and the north of the Yellow River is called Houtao (Rear Bend). The land in Houtao is even better than that in Qiantao, and after canals are opened, water from the Yellow River can enter the Wujia River, which is very convenient for irrigation, so it is more suitable for planting.</p>
<p>During the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, this area had already extended into the power of Qin and Jin. By the time of Qin Shihuang, he occupied the entire River Bend, where he established Jiuyuan Prefecture and many counties, and also migrated people to colonize the border. Later, the Central Plains were in turmoil, and the Xiongnu invaded. It was not until the time of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty that it was recaptured, and Shuofang and Wuyuan Prefectures were established, and large-scale migrations were carried out to open up canals, thus consolidating the northwest border defense. Unfortunately, the power of the Chinese government could not permanently protect this fertile land. Nomadic tribes in the north often ran in, and the already cultivated land was easily turned into barren grassland in their hands. The Ming Dynasty originally occupied the River Bend, but unexpectedly, when building the Great Wall, the entire Bend was built outside the wall, and it was silently abandoned. However, such a suitable place for cultivation could not hide its brilliance. After the mid-Qing Dynasty, fishermen, merchants, and farmers from Hebei, Shanxi, and other places relied on their own strength to reclaim the wilderness and established their homes in the desolate wilderness. In the early years of Guangxu, Wang Tongchun, relying on his heroic talent and creative intelligence, observed the terrain, identified the soil, and dug ditches, using all his life's energy to manage this place. As a result, canals crisscrossed, and millet and beans were all over the fields. Houtao became his prosperous kingdom, and countless refugees from all directions depended on him. Unfortunately, his development aroused the attention of the Qing government, which sent Yi Gu to supervise the reclamation affairs of Suiyuan. Official-run enterprises are always prone to abuses. Wang Tongchun's talent was restricted, and the rights that the people had worked so hard to obtain were also剥削. The river course was neglected, and reclamation stagnated. Even so, Wang's achievements are still巍然不朽. In the past, the western part of Suiyuan was entirely under the administration of the Salachi Hall, and from this time to the Republic of China, three new counties, Anbei, Wuyuan, and Linhe, were separated from Salachi. These three counties were developed by Wang Tongchun using his personal power in Houtao, which is worthy of eternal commemoration by future generations.</p>
<p>European Catholics have been preaching in Suiyuan for eighty years. When the Boxer Rebellion broke out in the interior, the Mongolians in Suiyuan also responded and killed several Catholics. After the matter was settled, the church used this sum of money to dig a Huangshila Canal, reclaim a lot of wasteland, and add many churches. Because the priests were not afraid to see officials, and the church could avoid the disasters of war and bandits, ordinary farmers flocked to them. Now, the land owned by Catholics in Linhe County almost accounts for half of the county. The people there can only recognize the church and have no relationship with the government.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, Zhang Xiangwen, Wang Hongyi, and others had been to Houtao to run reclamation projects, but they all failed due to banditry or poor management. At present, there are four groups who are tirelessly engaged in development work and have the hope of success. Let me talk about them in the order of their establishment.</p>
<p>In 1929, Yan Xishan donated 60,000 yuan to open a new agricultural experiment field in the southeast of Salachi County. His purpose was to test the large-scale farming system and establish new villages. He hired Jinling University Agricultural College faculty members such as Ren Chengtong to manage and devote all their efforts to the experiment of agricultural machinery and tools. The result was certainly time-saving and labor-saving, but the price of fuel consumed was higher than the value of local labor and cattle. In a society with low wages, it was not economical, so he had to continue to use the old method of reclaiming wasteland and use machinery to supplement the lack of labor. Later, it was affected by the political situation, and funds were not available. The staff took the cause as their top priority and were willing to sacrifice. They formulated a ten-year construction plan, with the first five years as the reclamation period and the last five years as the new village construction period. Within these ten years, the annual expenses were paid from the production income, and the profits were used as bonuses and promotion expenses; and the funds given by Yan and the provincial government were used as loans, which were repaid in installments after the completion of the new village construction. There are now 200 households of reclaimed land farmers, 1,000 people, more than 200 hectares of reclaimed land, and 20 hectares of nurseries, planting alfalfa for animal husbandry.</p>
<p>In 1931, Yan Xishan, Fu Zuoyi, and others established the Sui District Reclamation Supervision Office, allocated four regiments of soldiers, and recruited three teams of military officers for reclamation in Wuyuan and Linhe in order to provide relief to unemployed military officers. They were divided into fifteen townships, and the distributed area was very wide. Because of abundant resources, the equipment was very complete. Yan advocated the land village ownership system, which was just right to use this reclamation area as a field trial.</p>
<p>In 1933, the lower reaches of the Yellow River collapsed, and Changyuan and other counties in southern Hebei suffered severe disasters. Duan Chengzhe united with Gu Zhongxiu and others to initiate the Hebei Immigrant Association and selected 100 households to immigrate to Baotou for reclamation. Duan was originally a division commander. He happened to travel to the River Bend, trekking in the uninhabited grassland for hundreds of miles. Suddenly, he saw a castle with lush trees and hundreds of households. When asked, it was run by foreign missionaries. There were many such places, and each place was like an independent country, and the people lived and worked in peace and contentment. He was too刺戟 by this. He thought why Chinese people could not, so he left the military life in 1929 and opened a flour company in Baotou, and also tried planting rice, which was very successful. At this time, he established the Hebei New Village with immigrants, granting each household one hectare of land. In 1935, he immigrated to Wuyuan again and organized Mingxuan Township. When he first started immigration, there were rumors that he was deceiving soldiers, and the people in good standing were hesitant to move forward. But when the farmers remitted money to their hometowns a year after moving, the psychology of the locals changed greatly. Now, when a batch is moved every year, everyone is eager to sign up. He wanted to take education as the center to form a new society, so he used many new educational methods in his new village.</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, many people from the Northeast who fled to Guannei could not find a way out. In 1934, Zhu Jiqing and others organized the Northwest Immigrant Committee, which was presided over by Ren Zuotian, and immigrated to Heshuogong in Anbei, reclaiming about 200 hectares of land. The east side of the reclamation area is Ulansu Sea, which is an excellent place for fishing and hunting. They are an organization of group production. The experimental period is five years. During this period, they jointly produce and jointly consume. The profits are also shared publicly. Because of this, their organization is very strict, and their lives are extremely disciplined. Individual actions are everywhere controlled by the group, and there is no freedom.</p>
<p>After reading the above brief description, it can be seen that although their organizations are different, they are all full of creativity and hard work. Their work is no longer limited to reclamation but has further engaged in the attempt of new social organizations. They are pioneers. If the results of the experiment are not good, they will sacrifice themselves. If the experiment is good, they will let future generations benefit from it. The greatness of this spirit is worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>However, it is not enough to just admire their work. We must also ask the government and experts to assist them. Houtao has excellent land but cannot make full use of its land power. This is the so-called "goods abandoned on the land." But how can we make the land尽其利? This must be carried out jointly under a large plan. If the government can set up fewer agencies to reduce the burden on farmers, develop transportation to transport and sell farmers' products, encourage public and private immigration so that hardworking and self-sufficient poor farmers in the interior can have a place to settle down, and buy the land of large landlords and sell it to tenant farmers at low prices so that they can be promoted to self-cultivating farmers, then the degree of development will certainly exceed the current stage. If many professionals are willing to give up the prosperous life of the city for the survival of the Chinese nation and devote themselves to this reclamation work, using their technology to improve agricultural tools, extensively repair water conservancy, prevent and treat diseases, increase production, and determine their uses according to the nature of the soil, where should be耕区, where should be 牧区, where should be 林区, and provide education according to actual needs so that the farmers there have spiritual安顿 and a proper志向, then this newly developed area will immediately become an ideal society.</p>
<p>How can the reclamation undertaking in Houtao not repeat the mistakes of the late Qing Dynasty and continue to prosper, not only solve the living problems of some reclaimed land farmers but also enrich the national defense of the northwest, not only enrich the national defense of the northwest but also conduct trials of new social organizations to solve future livelihood problems? This is a very important thing. I hope the readers of this article will be willing to think about it!</p>
<h3>Stalin Thoroughly Investigates Large-Scale Embezzlement and Bribery Cases</h3>
<p>Up to 300 Government Officials Arrested, Yagoda's Wife and Others Reportedly Committed Suicide in Fear of Punishment</p>
<p>[Moscow] A secret organization with a very wide scope was recently discovered in the Soviet Russian bureaucracy. Many members of the political police department also used it to enrich themselves. Therefore, Soviet dictator Stalin feels that it is indeed necessary to actively carry out the purification work. It is reported that up to 300 important government officials have been arrested. Many people outside the bureaucracy are also involved. Among the arrested important figures, in addition to the former head of the political police bureau, Yagoda, there are also the director of the police housing group, Laurie, the director of the police discipline group, Fettmann, and the director of the police finance group, Asderovsky. Yagoda's wife, a former prosecutor's office lawyer, was not arrested this time, but she has committed suicide in fear of punishment. It is also reported that the houses and equipment formerly owned by criminals were privately transferred by the political police department members without waiting for the court's determination. Among them, Laurie alone擅自处置 dozens of buildings and thousands of civilian houses. Fettmann shielded his subordinates in every possible way. Asderovsky took all the gold, silver, and foreign currency obtained from searching residences as his own. In addition, Pugreplinsky, an organizer of the model area for workers' housing, has also committed suicide in fear of punishment. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 24th)</p>

<h3>Japan and Russia Have Reached Preliminary Understanding on Adjusting Relations</h3>
<p>Sato Has Obtained Cabinet Members' Agreement, Will Continue Talks with Russian Envoy in the Coming Days</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Since taking office, Foreign Minister Sato has made adjusting relations with Russia the most urgent matter in Japanese diplomacy. He has met with the Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan twice to exchange important opinions in order to find a basis for adjusting relations between the two countries. As a result, the Foreign Minister reached an important understanding on fundamentally improving relations between the two countries. On the 20th, he obtained the understanding of the Army and Navy Ministers. On the 23rd, he reported his policy at the cabinet meeting and obtained the agreement of the members. The Foreign Minister plans to meet with the Russian envoy again in the coming days to continue negotiations on specific issues. (Allied News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] It was learned from responsible sources today that the report that Japanese Foreign Minister Sato and Russian Ambassador Yulenev had reached a fundamental understanding on adjusting Japanese-Russian relations is completely unfounded. However, the Japanese Foreign Minister and the Russian Ambassador have held talks twice recently, once on April 15 and once on Tuesday. In the future, they may have to continue to do so. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the third talk will be held at the beginning of next week. The newspaper also said that Yulenev will leave Tokyo for Berlin at the beginning of next month to take up the post of Ambassador to Germany. There are not many days left. It is difficult to predict what the results of the talks will be within this limited period. However, it is expected that the first stage of adjusting Russian-Japanese relations will be completed before Yulenev's departure. The Soviet government is clearly eager to resolve the issue of the Japanese-Manchurian border. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Streetcar Workers to Stage General Strike</h3>
<p>Labor and Management Take a Hard Line</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The dispute between the Tokyo city streetcar and bus workers has little hope of being resolved because the attitude of the city authorities and the employees is very strong. The labor side's fighting headquarters has issued a second directive to continue the slowdown. Both sides have almost entered the system of a general strike. If the city authorities do not give a considerable response within a day or two, then a general strike is almost inevitable. (Allied News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The slowdown of the Tokyo streetcar and bus employees has been going on for two days now, and there is no sign of an early resolution. The number of streetcars running has been reduced by half compared to usual, and the number of buses has been reduced by 20%. The Transportation Workers Union, which initiated the strike, today rejected the Tokyo city's proposal to increase wages by 8% and still insisted on its demand for a 20% wage increase. The city authorities hope that the police will intervene, but the police have not taken any action. The strike involves 25,000 workers. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt to Visit Philippines Next Year</h3>

<h3>Japanese Parties Begin Campaigning in Earnest</h3>
<p>A Total of 826 Candidates, the Seiyūkai and Minseitō Parties Can Control the Situation</p>
<p>[Tokyo] With only six days remaining until the general election, the outcome is already becoming evident in the election campaigns. Those familiar with Japanese politics unanimously predict that the Minseitō and Seiyūkai parties will undoubtedly achieve an overwhelming victory. Together, they are expected to secure 380 to 400 seats in the House of Representatives, accounting for 80% to 85% of the 466 seats. The remaining seats will likely be distributed equally among other factions on the left, right, and center. The final stage of the election contains five notable features: ㊀ A general lack of enthusiasm for the election among the populace, resulting in 52 fewer candidates compared to previous elections. ㊁ The close cooperation between the Minseitō and Seiyūkai parties. ㊂ The increasingly sharp antagonism between the fascist camp, advocating for breaking the current stalemate, and the anti-fascist camp. ㊃ The redoubled efforts of leftist elements. ㊄ Negative reactions towards veterans and other far-right groups. Furthermore, the joint unveiling of a clear anti-government banner by the Minseitō and Seiyūkai parties is noteworthy. Their victory is undoubtedly a reflection of the public's opposition to the current government. Under such circumstances, the existence of the Hayashi cabinet will completely lose its meaning. However, the current establishment of the Planning Board, the Central Economic Council, and other planned resolutions indicate that the Hayashi cabinet not only has no intention of resigning but is also showing unexpected activity. Observers believe that this tough stance by the government is a preparation to execute the following two steps: ㊀ Using the threat of another dissolution of the Diet as leverage to pressure the Minseitō and Seiyūkai parties into compromise. ㊁ Conspiring to divide the Minseitō and Seiyūkai parties while actively uniting the right-wing and neutral minor factions to form a new party after the general election. The future of the latter is bleak; even if a new party is formed in this way, it would merely be a group of corrupt politicians and would be difficult to maintain unity in the long run. Comparing the two, the former has a greater chance of success. (Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Each party officially concluded its candidate nominations yesterday, totaling 826 candidates. Starting today, they will begin the real battle of sending telegrams and issuing written statements. The Minseitō party believes it has already achieved an overwhelming victory in urban areas and will now infiltrate rural areas, aiming to increase its seats from the 205 it held at the time of dissolution to 235. The Seiyūkai party, due to its anti-government stance, has gained an advantage nationwide and hopes to increase its seats from the 172 at the time of dissolution to 208. The Social Democratic Party, launching its campaign early and seen as the darling of emerging forces, is very energetic and claims it can win 45 of its 65 candidates. Other parties are also quite confident, such as the Kokumin Dōmei with 15 and the Tōhōkai with around 12, both considered highly likely. Finally, it is currently impossible to predict the extent to which neutral and right-wing factions can make progress in this election, where established parties occupy most of the ground. (Dōmei News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese general election ended at midnight on the 23rd with the nomination of candidates, and the election battle entered its final act. The total number of candidates is 46 fewer than the previous general election. Specifically, the number of candidates from existing parties decreased by 70 for the Seiyūkai, 32 for the Minseitō, 13 for the Kokumin Dōmei, and 12 for the Shōwakai. However, the Social Democratic Party increased by 36, right-wing factions put forward 58, and neutral factions increased by 6. As for new candidates, there are 100 fewer compared to the last election. The number of candidates for each party is listed below:</p>

Viscount Chilston, and the Belgian Foreign Minister, Spaak, jointly signed two diplomatic documents at the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 AM today. The first was a declaration by Britain and France that Belgium was released from the obligations of a guaranteeing power under the Locarno Treaty and the mutual assistance obligations stipulated by the Anglo-French-Belgian general staff agreement of March 19 last year. The second was a declaration by the Belgian government acknowledging receipt of the above declaration. These documents have now been copied and sent to the ambassadors of Germany and Italy in Britain, France, and Belgium for transmission to their respective governments and will be submitted to the League of Nations for registration in the future. The full text will be published in the morning newspapers on Sunday. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels. After signing the above documents this morning, Foreign Minister Spaak held brief talks with the British and French ambassadors, followed by meetings with the German and Italian ambassadors. He personally delivered copies of the documents to the German and Italian ambassadors. In addition, the British and French governments simultaneously delivered copies of these documents to the German and Italian ambassadors in London and Paris, respectively. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Romanian-Polish Alliance</h3>
<p>Reaffirmed</p>
<p>⊙Bucharest. Following the arrival of Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck a few days ago, Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu hosted a banquet in his honor in the evening. During the banquet, he delivered a speech stating that the alliance treaty established between Poland and Romania in 1921 aims to safeguard peace, respect each other's existing borders, and promote international cooperation, adhering to the covenant of the League of Nations. It is purely defensive in nature, not directed at any country, nor does it exclude others. In response, Foreign Minister Beck stated that European countries are undergoing evolution in the new methods adopted in politics to maintain peace, even revising current diplomatic methods, which we are closely monitoring. The alliance treaty established between Poland and Romania is sufficient to meet the needs of the times. This cooperation is not driven by temporary circumstances but is a lasting necessity.

<h3>Vienna Police Raid Nazi Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Twenty Important Personnel Arrested, Austria Denies Cooperation with the Nazi Party</p>
<p>[Vienna] Police unexpectedly raided illegal Nazi Party organizations tonight. Because the raid was unexpected, the organizations were unprepared, resulting in the arrest of 20 important Nazi Party personnel and the seizure of a large number of documents. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Vienna] Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg held two important talks with Prime Minister Mussolini in Venice, Italy. He returned here this morning. Regarding the report in the Italian newspaper that the German and Austrian authorities had agreed to allow the Nazi Party to join the Austrian government, the Austrian Chancellor learned of this rumor on his way back. According to well-informed political sources, the report is not true, and the government will issue a statement on this matter shortly. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>⊙Venice. Regarding the news in the Italian newspaper that members of the Nazi Party are about to participate in Austrian politics, political figures here are paying close attention and say that even before the meeting between Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Prime Minister Mussolini, there were rumors that the Prime Minister would advise Chancellor Schuschnigg on this matter. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>[Vienna] Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, told his Rome newspaper by telephone yesterday that as a result of the talks between Mussolini and Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, the Austrian government would soon be able to join the Nazi Party. The Austrian non-officialdom circles were shocked and suspicious. When former Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss was assassinated in 1934, Italy immediately sent troops to the Brenner Pass. Is Italy still prepared to guarantee Austria's independence, as it did in 1934? This is one of the questions asked by all circles in Austria. The general public believes that the greatest force in Italian foreign policy is the feeling of the Rome-Berlin plot. The news in the Italian newspaper has made this feeling even deeper. Although officialdom public announcements have been saying that Italy and Austria have the same views, there is something to pay attention to. There were indeed differences of opinion between Italy and Austria. Many Austrians now fear that national affairs will be transferred into the hands of the Nazi Party. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>[Rome] According to the opinions of general observers, the result of the talks between Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Prime Minister Mussolini should enable Austria to cooperate closely with Germany. After the two men spoke, they agreed that: ㊀ Austria should abandon all steps against Germany in diplomatic matters, such as entering into agreements with Czechoslovakia, etc. ㊁ In Austrian domestic affairs, efforts should be made to enable the Nazi Party to participate in cooperation. Regarding the latter, the semi-official Italian newspaper today published an article by the well-known journalist Gayda, stating that the Nazi Party is about to participate in the cadres of the Austrian Patriotic Front, which is a prelude to the Nazi Party joining the Austrian government. The way to participate is that the Patriotic Front will hire one member of the Nazi Party as an advisor to assist the leader of the Front, Chancellor Schuschnigg, and Secretary Zeina. Thereafter, if disputes arise between the Austrian Nazi Party and the Patriotic Front, the advisor will act as an arbitrator. According to Italy's expectations, the relationship between Germany and Austria will become increasingly consolidated, so that the spirit and purpose of the Rome Protocol and the axis of European politics created by Germany and Italy can be integrated seamlessly. Therefore, it proposed to Austria that the Nazi Party be allowed to participate in cooperation in domestic affairs. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Hungary Satisfied with Italian-Austrian Talks</h3>
<p>Cabinet Meeting Held to Discuss</p>
<p>⊙Budapest. According to the semi-official Hungarian News Agency, all circles in Hungary welcome the talks between Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Vienna, viewing this as an indication that Austria has not abandoned the Roman system, and also believe that it can be seen from this that Austria has not fantasized about Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia forming a new group. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>⊙Budapest. After the Italian newspaper published the news yesterday that the Austrian Nazi Party was about to participate in the government, people here were deeply impressed by the news. Foreign Minister Ganya held talks with Italian Minister Davinci in the evening, and the Cabinet immediately convened a cabinet meeting to discuss the matter, which lasted until late at night. Political figures said recently that Prime Minister Daranyi is now taking strict measures to deal with the activities of the far-right, but it is inappropriate for foreign countries to encourage the momentum of Hungarian Nazi Party members.

<h3>Internal Strife Among Spanish Rebels, Germany Withdraws from the Vortex</h3>
<p>Göring to Visit Mussolini to Discuss, Mussolini to Visit Hitler</p>
<p>[Rome] Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg returned home today, while General Göring, Hitler's confidant, is taking in the beach air in Naples and will soon enter Rome to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini. It is likely that this conversation will have a very important relationship with the Spanish situation. In January of this year, General Göring and Mussolini had a conversation. Before long, the Spanish rebel leader Franco won the victory of capturing Malaga and other places. However, the events that will be discussed this time are different from before. It is heard that Germany and Italy are preparing to withdraw their volunteer soldiers in Spain, but other countries must guarantee that they will follow suit. Although this statement has not been verified by officialdom, it has been rife. Recently, personnel returning from Spain have used the Spanish National Army's supreme command to show the world the friendship between Italy and Germany. However, the Prime Minister may not accept his words, because the friendship between England and France has a long history, and there are still many Germans who have not forgotten the old friendship with England. All circles in Italy cannot help but be jealous. Mussolini will definitely take his own plane to Munich, or he may invite the German leader to travel with him, which is not known. However, Mussolini's political affairs are complicated, and it may not be possible to make the trip immediately. The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Stoyadinović, will consult with Mussolini, and German Foreign Minister Neurath and German Defense Minister Blomberg will come to Italy to visit the military exercises, and the Prime Minister will not be able to adapt for the time being. Libyan and Abyssinian troops will participate in this military exercise, and they will be assisted by many camel teams. When German guests watch it, they should feel what it is like to expand the colony's power. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Well-informed sources announced today that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will meet with Hitler at the leader's villa in Berchtesgaden, southern Germany, within the month. At that time, Italy and Germany may conclude an important agreement. (National Telegraph, 24th)</p>

<h3>Split Between Left and Right Wings of the American Labor Movement</h3>
<p>Railway Workers Brewing Strike, Ford Factory in California Begins Labor Strife</p>
<p>[Washington] American Federation of Labor President Green announced today that all unions belonging to the Committee for Industrial Organization should be immediately expelled. The Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor has also expressed its support for this move. The biggest split in the history of the American labor movement in the past 50 years has been created and cannot be saved, and it is expected that the struggle between these two major unions will become more intense. Green also said that since the unions belonging to the Committee for Industrial Organization believe that they have nothing to do with this association, it is not necessary to convene a general meeting to discuss the issue of expulsion. Green has now notified the presidents of 108 local unions to hold a joint meeting with the Executive Council in Cincinnati on May 18 to discuss expanding the organization to confront the Committee for Industrial Organization and increase "war expenses" to support the operation. However, the association's economy will be greatly affected, as one-third of its members have joined the Committee for Industrial Organization. The Committee for Industrial Organization is not willing to be outdone and is launching a counterattack. Chairman Lewis of the association declared that the actions of the Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor were irrelevant. In terms of numbers, the American Federation of Labor currently has about 2.6 million members, while the Committee for Industrial Organization has 2.029 million members.

<p>⊙Richmond, California. The strike of 1,800 workers at the Ford Motor Company factory here, once on strike, ended last night.

<h3>Japan's Iron Famine</h3>
<p>Minister of Railways Gotto Reports to the Emperor</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Because Japan is currently lacking in iron and there is the phenomenon of the so-called "iron famine", Minister of Railways Gotto specially went to the palace to meet the Emperor at 2:00 p.m. on the 23rd to report to the Emperor on the situation of adjusting the iron supply and demand after the government changed its iron policy, in great detail.

<h3>US Naval Exercise: Hawaii Island Falls</h3>
<p>⊙Honolulu. The US Navy's annual exercise has been testing the defense of the Hawaiian Islands, the so-called "Gibraltar of the Pacific", in recent days. Today, the outcome has been decided. According to reliable information obtained by the Associated Press from non-officialdom, the largest of the Hawaiian Islands, Hawaii Island, has been occupied by the invading forces. The invading forces are composed of one battleship, several fast cruisers, and several fighter-bombers. First, the naval fleet dispatched a large number of battleships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, and aircraft, pointing directly at Oahu Island, the main island of Hawaii, and then secretly dispatched a small team while the defending forces were unprepared, using surprise tactics to attack Hawaii Island and finally took it down in one fell swoop.

<h3>Taiwan Implements Elimination of Chinese Language and Script</h3>
<p>Chinese Version of Taiwanese Newspapers Abolished, Prohibition of Taiwanese Language Extends to Families</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since Japan's "Southward Advance Policy" accelerated last year, it has strictly cracked down on Chinese language and script and rigorously implemented its "National Language Movement" (i.e., Japanese language and script). The original population of Taiwan was surveyed last year to be five million people, of which the Southern Fujian and Quanzhou Chinese accounted for four million, Guangdong Chinese for 500,000, aborigines for 300,000, and Japanese for 200,000. The Chinese account for 90%, and the Southern Fujian Quanzhou Chinese account for 80%. They are all Quanzhou people who moved to Taiwan. After Japan divided Taiwan, they were incorporated into Japanese nationality, only 40 years ago. Therefore, the common language in Taiwan is Southern Fujian (also known as Xiamen dialect), and the writing used is still Chinese. Public schools (eight-year elementary schools) all teach Chinese. Above middle school, Chinese is even a compulsory subject. Taiwanese newspapers mainly use the Chinese version. Although the Japanese have been implementing their "National Language Movement" for 40 years, seeking to gradually abolish Chinese, they have not yet taken intervention measures, and the language is still allowed to be used freely. Since last year, the "National Language Movement" has been implemented suddenly and severely. For example, last summer, the Governor-General's Office ordered Taiwanese newspapers to change the Japanese version to the main version, and the Chinese version was moved to the supplementary version, and the Chinese version's length was reduced as much as possible. When the first military governor, Navy Admiral Kobayashi Seizō, took office, the Governor-General's political and legal status and powers were the same as those of the Korean Governor-General. He then ordered the abolition of Chinese courses in all schools from December 1. All 860 public schools in Taiwan, only 350 of which still had Chinese courses, were also completely abolished. As a result, no Chinese was taught in schools throughout Taiwan. At the same time, strict measures were also taken to crack down on the Taiwanese language (i.e., Southern Fujian). Last month, the Taiwan Governor-General's Office again ordered all newspapers to abolish the Chinese version from April 1 this year. Because of the relationship between sales, the newspapers requested a delay in implementation. According to Taiwan News on the 18th of this month, the Governor-General's Office has agreed to postpone the abolition of the Chinese version of newspapers to June 1 and ordered all newspapers to be notified. At the same time, the import of any of our country's newspapers is prohibited. The Taiwan Governor-General's Office is also working hard to popularize Japanese and strictly prohibit the Taiwanese language. Here are three pieces of news recorded in Taiwan's private "Taiwan Shinminpo" to show one aspect: ㊀ The number of National Language (Japanese) training centers in Hsinchu Prefecture has been increasing year by year. In 1936, there were 365 places, accommodating 23,000 people. 50 new locations have been established this year, and it is decided to reach 35,000 people. ㊁ The Taichung Prefecture Education Association held a meeting on the 9th. Governor Matsuoka and Police Chief Nakahira attended. It was resolved to actively carry out the education movement and sent a notice to all government offices, streets, villages, offices, banks, companies, and groups strictly prohibiting the use of the Taiwanese language "in order to popularize the national language. ㊂ In order to thoroughly popularize the national language, Taipei Prefecture decided on specific plans on the 3rd and implemented them immediately. The state's officials and the county's officials families who do not often use the national language are completely cleaned up. In the future, families who do not often use the national language will never be employed. Investigate families who often use the national language, designate those with excellent results as "national language families", and give them priority rights, such as permission for co-study of children and business permits (opium and other licensed businesses), all given priority. In addition, A. National language for film narrators, B. National language for storytelling and Taiwanese opera, C. Open national language village progress associations, etc. According to this, Taiwanese languages and scripts are all prohibited, even extending to private rooms of families. The pain of national subjugation can be said to be tragic.</p>
<p>In addition, overseas Chinese living in Taiwan planned to establish "Overseas Chinese Education Children's Schools" in Taiwan. The Taiwan Governor-General's Office did not allow it. The Taiwan Chinese Association once submitted a report to the Chinese Consulate-General in Taiwan, requesting it to negotiate. After the Consulate-General negotiated with the Governor's Office many times based on the situation, there were no results. Recently, the return of Consul-General Guo Yimin to Beijing and the visit of Japanese Consul-General Uchida Goro stationed in Fuzhou to Taiwan are all related to this case. It is found that in recent times, Taiwan has been vigorously singing the so-called Sino-Japanese friendly cooperation between Taiwan and Fujian, with official and civilian envoys everywhere. However, what is manifested is actually contradictory. (April 4, 21st)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou City Ferry Bombing Incident</h3>
<p>Extortion Failed, Bombs Used for Intimidation, Resulting in One Passenger Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The rural economy of Guangdong Province is increasingly bankrupt. Adding to this, the prices of all goods are soaring, and food prices are rising. Moreover, political changes have led to a massive increase in unemployment. The old and weak sit and wait for death, while the strong and brave take risks. Consequently, public safety incidents occur continuously. Examples include the increase in prostitution and the growing number of bandits. This is truly a serious social problem. It is noted that in the inland areas of Guangdong Province, the factions of "Hong Kong powder" (likely referring to opium or a related substance) are divided, and ferries between villages are crowded. Bandits take advantage of the vastness of rivers and lakes, combining with gangs to carry out robbery. Before looting, they often send letters to ferries in various villages, demanding huge sums. If their desires are not met, they send their members to secretly transport and detonate bombs as a demonstration. This kind of behavior is commonplace, and ship owners cannot prevent it. Until recently, a bomb attack injuring people occurred again on a village ferry in front of the Guangzhou levee. The newly built levee in Guangzhou was just completed. All the former bay long embankment village ferries have been moved to the front of the new levee. Among them is the "Liao Yong" ferry, which operates between Guangzhou and Xinzao Township in Panyu County. On the morning of the 18th, fully loaded with passengers and goods, it sailed from Xinzao Township to the provincial capital and docked at the new levee to unload goods. As usual, after clearing the cabin, it loaded goods and passengers in Guangzhou and sailed back to the village at noon. That morning, passengers had boarded the ship in succession. Just as it was about to sound the whistle and depart, a loud explosion suddenly occurred in the left corner of the public cabin of the Liao Yong ferry. Thick smoke billowed out. Passengers were greatly shocked and ran away from each other. Fortunately, the ship had not left the shore at this time, otherwise there would have been trampling and people falling into the water. The crew, having barely calmed down, rushed to the scene of the accident and found an iron can under the berth in the left corner of the public cabin. Because the lid of the bomb was very thick, it had not been completely shattered. The smell of explosives inside the can was pungent. A section of the wooden plank of the berth had been destroyed by the explosion. A passenger named Guo Tian was lying in a pool of blood. His head and limbs were severely wounded and he was barely breathing. He was then taken to the convenience hospital by ambulance for treatment. During the chaos, the police searched for bandits. A man named Jia, with a terrified expression, jumped into the water to escape. He was eventually arrested and handed over to the police for interrogation. The police also sent the recovered bomb can and an electric torch battery to the bureau. At the same time, the ship also sent three crew members to the police station to report the case. The ferry, with no major damage, departed back to the village in the afternoon. As for the injured passenger Guo Tian, after entering the hospital, he was still able to speak. He claimed that he was from Nanbu Village in Xinzao Township. He used to raise livestock. Yesterday, he took livestock to the provincial capital for sale and received more than one hundred yuan in cash. He had planned to return to the village, but unexpectedly suffered an undeserved disaster. It was truly unfortunate. After saying this, he sobbed repeatedly. According to the doctor, if Guo's wound does not fester, he may be safe. Otherwise, his life may be in danger. (Evening of April 18th)</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Zhejiang Security Team</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: The Zhejiang Provincial Security Brigade, with a total of fifteen teams, was originally planned by the Provincial Government to be reorganized into security police teams from April 1st, in accordance with the Central Government's orders. They would be distributed to various counties for service, based on the amount of funding originally raised by each county. However, due to difficulties in time and fact, the reorganization was postponed. Now, it is learned that the reorganization order has been forwarded to various levels. The key points of the reorganization implementation plan are recorded below:</p>
<p>㊀ The organization of the security police team is divided into three types: brigade, independent company, and independent platoon. The number of security police teams in each county (city) is determined by whether there are two or more companies, sufficient funding, and important defense. A brigade headquarters must be established to facilitate management and command. ㊁ The security police teams in each county will be established uniformly on July 1st. ㊂ Officers and soldiers of the security brigade who are dismissed due to the reorganization will be given one month's severance pay as a gesture of consideration. Those who are assigned other tasks will be given travel expenses but no severance pay. ㊃ Self-funded teams in each county, such as defense teams and militia cadres, must be disbanded by the end of June at the latest. ㊄ Vacancies in the security police teams in each county (city) should be filled by the county from July 1st, in accordance with the new staffing, by selecting capable individuals from the militia who have been trained in the county to strengthen the force.</p>
<p>Personnel matters of the security police team are under the control of the province. Each county has the power to assess, reward, punish, dismiss, but must provide detailed reasons and submit them to the district and then to the province for record. In addition, the security police team is usually dispatched by each county. However, in the event of special needs within the district, the administrative commissioner and district commander of the district may consider the situation and coordinate the dispatch and command. In the event of a large-scale bandit suppression that requires centralization, the provincial security commander will directly mobilize them. (April 24th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Distribution of Fish Fry at Rice Cultivation Field</p>
<p>The provincial rice cultivation experimental field outside the South Gate, in order to promote rural sideline businesses and increase farmers' production, has an attached fish fry breeding field. On the one hand, it raises a large number of high-quality fish fry between rice fields and ponds. On the other hand, it guides farmers to organize fish farming cooperatives and select river beaches, lakes, and other water surfaces according to law for fry raising. Since its implementation in 1935, it has been quite effective. In March of this year, the field has successively issued grass carp, carp, and black carp fry, totaling more than 13,000. It is said that the promotion results, compared with the previous year, show that the number of fish fry issued has increased fourfold. The number of guided and organized fish farming cooperatives has increased from three to nine, the number of natural ponds has increased from eleven to twenty, and the fish farming water area has increased from 24.5 mu to 92 mu. It is also learned that the field has recently printed several small books, such as "Rice Field Fish Farming Method," "Table Fish Calendar," "How to Organize a Fish Farming Cooperative," and "Using River Beaches and Lakes for Fish Farming," to promote publicity.</p>

<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Violent Winds and Heavy Rains Cause Disaster</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been alternately rainy and sunny, and the temperature is often inconsistent. On the 20th of this month, the weather was sultry. On the 21st, there were strong winds and heavy rains day and night, causing the spring flowers that had matured to be overturned in the fields. The accumulated water was several inches deep, and many were submerged, greatly reducing the harvest. In the eastern countryside, the new sand on one side has been collapsing for days, and it is now approaching the old bank. Hundreds of acres have been collapsed. Both old and new landowners are complaining. What is even more worrying is that the collapse of new and old sand land from outside Renshan to Kanshan is particularly severe. It is feared that the thousands of acres of flower land will soon become dangerous. On the 21st, the wind and rain did not stop. In the West Xiaojiang River, a rice boat from Keqiao to Linpu was blown and sunk by the wind, carrying more than 90 dan of white rice. Because it was nearly dark, no one was able to salvage it at the time. On the morning of the 22nd, nearby fishing boats salvaged it, recovering half of it. More than 40 dan, including the boat, sank in the heart of the river. By the evening of that day, no salvage had been made, and the loss was more than 400 or 500 yuan.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Relief Association Welcomed Baker Last Night</h3>
<p>Baker Spoke About the Actual Situation of the Sichuan Disaster, Zhu Qinglan and Others Telegraphed About the Disaster Situation</p>
<p>The Sichuan Relief Association held a meeting at the Sichuan Fellow Association on Dachuan Road last night to welcome Mr. Baker, the chief executive of the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee, who had just returned to Shanghai from Sichuan. More than 60 people including Dao Xiangyuren, Hu Zhengzhi, Fan Zhongqu, Tang Jinbai, Yang Jifu, Tang De'an, Zhang Shulin, Tan Yigong, Zheng Yushu, Yuan Yicun, Li Jingyu, Gui Rongfen, Lei Yuchun, and Li Yunjie attended. Yang Jifu was elected chairman, and Xiao Yanbin and Yang Zebao were recorders. The chairman delivered a welcome speech first, and thanked Mr. Baker for his kindness in entering Sichuan for disaster relief. Mr. Baker then stood up to deliver a speech, saying that he was ordered to enter Sichuan for disaster investigation this time, traveling back and forth for nearly two weeks. Before entering Sichuan, he thought that the serious situation of the Sichuan disaster generally reported might contain exaggeration. Therefore, he first went to the Nanjing Agricultural Experimental Field to investigate the statistical table of agricultural income in Sichuan Province last year, and carried it into Sichuan. Later, at the Chongqing Relief Association and the Chengdu Provincial Government, he saw the actual situation reports of the disaster area investigated by the Sichuan Relief Committee, and then he knew that the Sichuan disaster was indeed extremely serious. The disaster-stricken area can be divided into four grades: ㊀ extremely severe disaster area, ㊁ secondary severe disaster area, ィ light disaster area, ㊃ non-disaster area. When I passed through Chongqing, I saw from the plane that there were no crops in the fields at all. When I arrived in Chongqing, I learned that there were about 18,000 refugees from the nearby area in the city. Within a week before my arrival, more than 800 people had starved to death. The dead were immediately buried by the local authorities. After that, an average of about 100 people died every day, and refugees from the four townships continued to pour into Chongqing. From Chongqing to Chengdu, the counties I passed through were all third-class light disaster areas. I personally saw women and children digging soil and grass roots, grinding sorghum, and cooking porridge to fill their hunger. In each county along the way, one-tenth was low-lying and could be reluctantly planted, hoping for half a harvest. The remaining five-tenths were higher ground, and four-tenths were the highest ground. If it rained recently, the higher ground could still have three-tenths of a harvest, while the highest ground was hopeless. Many people and foreign missionaries told me that if there was no heavy rain in the next two weeks, then this light disaster area would also become a severe disaster area, and there would be no harvest this year. According to the survey, there are about 9 million people in the severe disaster area, and although not everyone needs relief, at least one-fifth of the people have nothing to eat and must be relieved immediately. The most suitable method of relief is work-for-relief. Based on my experience in handling relief in North China 16 years ago, if we handle emergency relief and distribute money and rice, the funds will be used a lot and the effect will be small. If we handle work-for-relief, the funds can be saved by half, and the results can be doubled. Therefore, I have contributed my opinions to the Sichuan authorities, advocating the rapid construction of highways and railways, paying wages with relief funds, and letting charitable organizations come forward to be responsible, which is the most appropriate. Therefore, if this matter is handled properly, the disaster situation, although severe, is not impossible to recover.</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan and Cao Zhongzhi, members of the Relief Committee, telegraphed the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association yesterday to report on the Sichuan disaster situation, saying: ㊀ In Chongqing, an average of 1,800 people have starved to death every month since January 1st. Previously, the Public Security Bureau issued 1.5 yuan for burial expenses for each starvation death. Now, due to the increased mortality rate, only 80 cents are issued per person. Now, in order to maintain the health of the citizens, a crematorium has been decided to be built. ㊁ There are many orphaned children in Chongqing who are displaced and in a miserable situation. We are now starting to take in and educate them. ㊂ The starved corpses in Chongqing are mostly people who fled from the nearby disaster areas. We are now planning to set up ten porridge factories, which will be run by local charitable organizations. ㊃ The disaster situation in Sichuan Province has become a widespread phenomenon. The disaster area accounts for four-fifths of the province, and the disaster victims account for one-half of the province. The disaster area is divided into three types: severe disaster, secondary severe disaster, and light disaster. The severe disaster area includes nine counties: Zhongxian, Daxian, Guang'an, Quxian, Yilong, Yuechi, Yingshan, Liangshan, and Wusheng, as well as Chonghua, Suijing, and two villages. The secondary severe disaster area includes 35 counties such as Jiangjin and Hechuan. The light disaster area includes 89 counties such as Baxian and Yongchuan. There are a total of 8.5 million disaster victims in the severe disaster area, and the disaster in Bazhong is particularly severe, with 2.5 million people. As for the counties that have received rain, there were 29 cities and counties in the past month, including Chongqing, Dianjiang, and Yibin. In addition, 49 counties such as Xinjin also received light rain. Recently, there was another rain, but the rainfall was very small and did not help spring plowing. If there is no heavy rain within a month, the autumn harvest this year will be hopeless, which is very worrying. Zhu Qinglan and Zeng Zhongzhi respectfully report.</p>
<h3>Records of Contemporary People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Wang Luyi, Secretary-General of the Supervisory Yuan, left Beijing by overnight express train at 11 p.m. the night before last and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. Mr. Sun got off at Zhenru and returned to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest.</p>
<p>It was said that Mr. Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. It is now learned that Mr. Wang is unable to spare time in Beijing, so he did not arrive in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Telegraphs the Ministry of Finance to Cancel the Salt Tax Increase</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council of the First Special District of this city telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying: The Hon. Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: According to a report from the Fourth District Branch of this council, the report is for the salt tax increase, which causes pain to the people. We beseech your council to forward it to the Ministry of Finance to request the cancellation of additional taxes to reduce the burden on the poor. According to the announcement of the Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Envoy and the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, on April 1st of this year, a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stated that the country is now engaged in economic construction, which is related to the national revival plan, and is preparing funds to promote it. It is planned to levy special funds for construction projects under the salt tax of each district, for a period of five years, and to levy one yuan per dan (a unit of weight) according to the market scale. Please inform all merchants and people. Economic construction should be followed, but it is found that salt is an essential element of people's health, as important as food. The price of salt in Shanghai has increased from 5.6 yuan per dan year by year to 10.54 yuan per dan including cost price by June 16th last year, which is equal to the salt tax rate in the interior. Unexpectedly, before one year, it was added again for construction, and one yuan was added to each dan, and the selling price reached 11.54 yuan, which is similar to the high price of sugar, which is really unbearable for the poor and laborers. Western Shanghai is especially an area of ​​laborers and coolies, with extremely tight economy, and most of them are already unable to make ends meet. Everyday life depends only on firewood, rice, and salt. Now, buying one catty of salt requires more than 400 yuan, which is very painful economically. Many people have come to the council to apply. The council is concerned about the livelihood and health of laborers and the poor, and has prepared to report to your council for review and grant to forward it to the Ministry of Finance to withdraw the additional one yuan and revoke the order, etc. to relieve the people's difficulties. It is found that salt is needed for people's livelihood, and taxes have been increased year by year, and prices have soared. If the tax is increased again, it will greatly affect the people's livelihood and health. According to the previous situation reported, it is reasonable to telegraph your ministry to approve the cancellation of the new tax amount to relieve the people's difficulties. The President of the Municipal Council of the First Special District of Shanghai, Lin Kanghou respectfully bows.</p>
<h3>President Yu Telegraphed Shaanxi to Decline Birthday Wishes</h3>
<p>If the Name Can Be Changed, I Will Do My Best to Help It Succeed</p>
<p>Yu Youren, President of the Supervisory Yuan, will have his birthday on the 30th of this month. The women of Shaanxi intend to raise funds to build a library to commemorate it. Yesterday, he specially telegraphed to decline, to express his opinion, increase the scope, change the name, to commemorate all the patriots and martyrs since the revolution. The original telegram said: The Xi'an Xijing Daily forwarded to all friendly colleagues: Reading the newspaper, I know that all old friends intend to raise funds to build a library for the birthday of Youren and his wife as a good omen. I am ashamed and dare not accept it. The colleagues of the affiliated departments and units also intend to rise up. Youren believes that due to his position, he cannot set an example, so he has resolutely declined. I dare not accept any gifts. However, I am deeply grateful for the good intentions of my friends in my hometown, who are working hard for local culture, and I will do my best to help it succeed. If the scope can be increased and the name changed to commemorate all the patriots and martyrs since the revolution, so that the scale is broader and more lasting, and the required construction costs are insufficient, Youren will find a way to raise enough funds. As for the cost of purchasing books, it will be calculated separately. Respectfully announce the trivial matter, and hope to help with love. Yu Youren respectfully.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notifies Local Chambers of Commerce That the Scope of Public Debt Has Been Widened</h3>
<p>But One-Third Has Not Yet Been Revised</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified 13 chambers of commerce in Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxian, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Changshu, Qingpu, Kunshan, Shaoxing, Wujin, Fengxian, Jiaxing, and Zhenjiang yesterday, saying: Greetings, regarding the provisions of Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Income Tax Regulations and Article 5 of the First Category Collection Notice Draft, when this chamber convened the Income Tax Research Association meeting, the representatives proposed to forward a request to delete the restrictive words "one-third" and the words "the public reserve fund is limited to the public reserve fund stipulated by laws and regulations". After discussion, it was decided to forward it to the Ministry of Finance for review and processing, and because it had not been approved for a long time, it was submitted for urging. On the 23rd of this month, the Ministry of Finance issued Approval No. 12898, which stated that the Ministry of Finance checked and learned that Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Income Tax Provisional Regulations stipulates that the public reserve fund is limited to the statutory public reserve, arbitrary public reserve, and retained earnings. Item 8 of the First Category Collection Notice has clearly stipulated it, and you should know it. I hereby notify you specifically, and hope you will check it. The scope of Item 5 of the Draft Notice on the Collection of the Third Category of Income Tax has been widened.</p>
<h3>Last Night, Five Organizations Hosted a Reception Where Sand King Reported on the Details of Suiyuan and Mongolia</h3>
<p>Mongolian Banners' Transportation and Economic Construction Proceeding Steadily - Hoping the Nation Focuses on the Northwest to Consolidate National Defense</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, Shakdurjab, Chairman of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Political Council and also League Chief of the Ikhezhao League (referred to as Sand King), Ochirkhuyagtu, Zasag Beizi of the Zhasake Banner of the Ikhezhao League and also a member of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Council (referred to as Or King), Kang Jimin, Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Army of the Seven Banners of the Ikhezhao League and also Beile of the Dalate Banner, and Chief of the Industry Department of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Political Council (referred to as Kang King), each accompanied by their Fujin (i.e., wives) and Living Buddha Gelaiseng Yishan and others, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday after visiting Putuo. Yesterday evening at 6:30 PM, five organizations, including the Shanghai Students Association for Frontier Affairs, the Southwest Frontier Development Association, the Northwest Problem Research Association, the Mongolian Chahar and Suiyuan Sketching Association, and the Chinese Frontier Education Committee, held a tea party at the fourth floor of the Great World Company to welcome Sand King and others. At the scene, Sand King reported on the recent work of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Political Council. His speech was extremely earnest. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Activities</p>
<p>After Sand King and others arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday morning, they immediately opened a room in the inn. Everything was handled by Chu Mingshan, Director of the Mongolian Affairs Office of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission, and others. Yesterday morning, they visited various bustling places in the city together. In the afternoon at 6:30 PM, Sand King, accompanied by Khatu Ochir Bente, Assistant to the Zasake Banner of the Ikhezhao League, and others, went to the Great World Company to participate in the tea party of the five organizations. Kang King and others rested in their residence due to fatigue from the journey.</p>
<p>Lin King's Speech</p>
<p>The tea party last night was presided over by Lin Kanghou. First, Mr. Lin reported that it was a great honor for Sand King to grace us with his presence today. Currently, all regions are on the right track, and therefore everyone is paying attention to the frontier areas. The frontier is of great importance to national defense. From now on, we must unanimously pay attention to this, develop the frontier, and strengthen national defense. This is the significance of today's welcome, and so on. Then Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, roughly saying that the Mongolian and Tibetan peoples have a very glorious history, such as Genghis Khan, who is still the most glorious national hero. Today we welcome Sand King and others, and we want to restore the spirit of our ancestors, and so on. Then Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and others delivered speeches.</p>
<p>Sand King's Reply</p>
<p>Today, I am very honored to receive the warm hospitality of the five frontier organizations and the prominent leaders of Shanghai. I am very honored to have this opportunity to talk with you all. 1. The Suiyuan-Mongolian Political Council, since its establishment in March of last year due to environmental needs, with the support of the Central Government and Chief Executive Fu Zuoyi, has been in existence for a year now. During this time, my colleagues and I have followed the instructions of the central leaders and struggled hard, so we were able to give the bandits a major blow before the war. Afterwards, we promoted local autonomy in Suiyuan and Mongolia in accordance with the Outline and the resolutions of the successive conferences. Now, I will report on education, security, industry, and health. ㊀ In terms of education, the existing schools in the leagues and banners of Suiyuan have been ordered to continue to improve. Those that have not been established will be urged to open in accordance with the Ministry of Education's frontier education plan. As far as the current situation is concerned, in addition to the National Mongolian Banner Normal School and the Tumet Middle School, the primary schools in the eighteen banners have been established. Recently, the Education Department has also launched literacy campaigns, circular teaching methods, and adult education to improve the knowledge of the Mongolian people as soon as possible. ㊁ In terms of security, the Mongolian banners in Suiyuan are located on the border and are the front line of national defense. To the east are the bandits, and to the west is the Red Scourge. Protecting the territory and ensuring the safety of the people is an urgent task. The Mongolian banner army has been repeatedly ordered by the central government to unify its organization. However, in reality, it is still governed separately. At the beginning of the establishment of this council, it was decided to unify the organization. Currently, it is starting with changing the regimental numbers. It is also important to train the masses and increase self-defense capabilities. Regarding this matter, we have already started with a census. The above two matters have been completed when I left Suiyuan. The second step is to train them separately. ㊂ In terms of industry, Mongolia has a vast territory and a sparse population. The Hetao area has fertile land, and the Ula Mountains are rich in minerals. In recent years, the climate has become more temperate and suitable for planting. The existing wasteland will be developed separately, and the Mongolian people will be taught agricultural knowledge so that they can cultivate their own land and feed themselves. Planting poplar and elm trees extensively along the river will not only be useful in the future when they become forests, but also prevent desertification and flooding. Secondly, animal husbandry is a specialty of the Mongolian people. Unfortunately, they stick to the old methods and do not know how to improve them. As a result, the number has decreased year by year. Last year, the snow disaster and livestock epidemic killed almost all of them. This situation has a serious impact on the Mongolian people's economy. Regarding this point, we are now consulting with the Central Mongolian-Suiyuan Epidemic Prevention Office to prevent epidemics. At the same time, we also plan to set up large-scale pastures and hire experts to study livestock improvement and feed equipment. Again, for transportation construction, transportation is the hub of all political implementation. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, the central government's decrees took years to reach them, which was a great waste of time. Currently, most of the leagues and banners in Suiyuan have post offices, and documents can be sent back and forth quickly. Moreover, the supervisory office is installing radio stations in each banner. If there is anything important, it can be broadcast throughout the country in a moment. For road construction, the Industry Department had a proposal at the first conference to build roads in the four eastern banners of the Ula and Ikhezhao Leagues. The design is very detailed, and construction can begin as soon as the construction funds are received. In addition, we also plan to set up factories in suitable locations. The Construction Committee is currently discussing this. As for the council's headquarters, it has been decided to be at the Gongmiaozi in the West Gong Banner. The design has been surveyed, and construction can begin as soon as the funds arrive. ㊃ In terms of health, the Mongolian population has been decreasing year by year. The reason for this is partly due to religious relations and partly due to lack of prevention. Currently, the Health Department is discussing prevention and control with the Central Suiyuan-based Mongolian Health Institute and other agencies. If it can be realized, not only will the health of the Mongolian people increase, but the population will also increase rapidly. 2. Last year, the bandits invaded Suiyuan, and the national army fought hard. People from all over the country transported supplies to support the army or went to comfort them in person. I was born in the Republic of China and am a frontier official. My duty is to encourage my colleagues to follow Chairman Fu Zuoyi and persevere to the end so that the country's territory will not be lost by a single point. 3. Last spring, Suiyuan and Mongolia suffered a snow disaster. The Shanghai Relief Society sent people to provide relief. Last winter, the bandits invaded, and Mr. Wang Xiaolai and Miss Chen Bo'er and other celebrities went to comfort the army in person. On behalf of the people of Suiyuan and Mongolia, I would like to express my gratitude to them one by one. 4. During my trip to Beijing and Suzhou, I saw rapid progress everywhere. This spirit is admirable. I hope that this spirit will focus on the Northwest, not only to adjust the national economy, but also to strengthen our national defense, and so on.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Government's Decision on the Petition of the Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Trade Association</h3>
<p>The Original Disposition of the Social Affairs Bureau Is Upheld</p>
<p>In the case of a labor dispute involving all silk weaving factory workers in this city demanding wage increases and improved treatment from the factory, the Social Affairs Bureau previously issued Instruction No. 8476. The Shanghai Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Trade Association expressed its dissatisfaction and filed a petition with the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government has decided to uphold the original disposition. The Shanghai Municipal Government's</p>
<p>Decision</p>
<p>(Petition No. 94) is recorded as follows: Petitioner: Cai Shengbai, representative of the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Trade Association, address: 5th Floor, Silk Industry Building, Hankou Road, Shanghai. The petitioner filed a petition with this government in dissatisfaction with the disposition of Instruction No. 8476 of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The decision of this government is as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>The original disposition of the Social Affairs Bureau is upheld.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>This government, according to the Social Affairs Bureau's submission on the 9th of this month, investigated that in the case of a labor dispute involving all silk weaving factory workers in this city demanding wage increases and improved treatment from the factory, the bureau, together with the Municipal Party Headquarters, convened three mediation committees to conduct mediation. Because the workers raised as many as thirty conditions and the two sides argued and could not reach a decision, in order to avoid the expansion of the labor unrest, this bureau, in addition to allowing the two sides to follow the agreed terms, impartially determined a general wage increase of 10% for the wage increase part, and all other wage-related terms were revoked. There were also two items on contract machinery and statutory holiday wages, which were also agreed upon by the Municipal Party Headquarters and a compromise was ordered to be followed by both parties. After receiving the order, the labor and management of the industry initially harbored intentions to wait and see. After this bureau repeatedly sent personnel to various districts to earnestly persuade them, the workers of each factory resumed work one after another on the 3rd and 4th of this month," and so on, and attached a copy of Instruction No. 8476 of the bureau to the government. During the formal review, the Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Trade Association filed a petition with this government in dissatisfaction with the disposition of the instruction, and the Social Affairs Bureau submitted a response to the case to the government.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>The petitioner filed a petition in dissatisfaction with the disposition of Instruction No. 8476 of the original disposition office. However, all the items listed in the instruction were recorded with the consent of both parties when the mediation was convened. However, the petitioner requested to amend them afterwards, which is fundamentally inappropriate. For the time being, let's first discuss the first part of the petition's purpose. 1. Regarding the request to delete the three words "preparation department" in Article 14, "The employment of apprentices in the employee department shall be handled in accordance with the filing method of the trade association" has already been seen in Article 13 of the original instruction. Therefore, the phrase "preparation department" in Article 14, according to the provisions of Article 63 of the Factory Law, the number of apprentices recruited by the factory shall not exceed one-third of the workers. Article 14 of the instruction actually allowed some factories in the industry to recruit apprentices exceeding the legal quota, which is not unfavorable to the factory. Since the article has been agreed upon by both parties, the petitioner shall not raise any further objections. 2. Regarding the request to add "to be implemented when each industry in Shanghai is implemented" to Articles 23 and 24 of the original instruction, the original text of both articles is based on the provisions of Articles 37 and 45 of the Factory Law. The Factory Law has been in effect for a long time. Except for Article 13, which was resolved by the Central Political Conference due to special circumstances and a preparatory period for implementation was set separately, the rest have not been ordered to be suspended. All factories that apply to the law in accordance with Article 1 of the law shall have the obligation to comply. The petitioner's opposition to the non-implementation of all industries is unreasonable. As for what is stipulated in the procedures for the implementation of factory inspection, it is entirely for the convenience of factory inspection work. The inspection work can be carried out in stages, and the implementation of the Factory Law has no explicit provisions for phased implementation. The reasons for the original petition are obviously misunderstandings. 3. Regarding the request to modify the general wage increase of 10%, the Social Affairs Bureau responded that "When mediating, the management advocated setting standard wages, but the financial resources of each factory are different, and the proposal of standards cannot be decided in a few words. This bureau was afraid of the delay of the dispute, and proposed a grading method, but both sides did not agree. Therefore, it was decided to increase wages by 10% in general, and all similar wage increase articles were revoked. The original wages of each factory have been implemented for a long time, and although they are not standard, they have become a habit. A general increase is the principle required by the labor side, and 10% is within the ability of the management. Moreover, a small number of factories in the industry who understand the truth have reconciled with the workers themselves and are willing to increase wages, or even more than 10%. The workers in the industry, after receiving the instruction from this bureau, were not satisfied with the general wage increase of 10%. They requested that the order be withdrawn. After being instructed to enlighten them, they have been able to comply with the order," and so on. The bureau's handling is not inappropriate. The petitioner is inevitably stubborn and deviates from the meaning of labor-management coordination. 4. Regarding the request to amend the contract machinery issue, the bureau responded that "Contract machinery is in the nature of contracting, which was originally claimed by the management representatives of the industry. At that time, the labor representatives insisted on opposing the leasing mechanism. There are two reasons: one is to avoid third parties deducting wages from it, and the second is to determine the employment relationship between labor and management. In view of the firm decision of the management of the visit industry, this bureau is unwilling to cancel the leasing mechanism, and the reasons held by the labor side are the key points of the subcontracting system. Therefore, a compromise plan was formulated, as listed in the original instruction," and so on. However, the petitioner suddenly advocated handling it in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code. The nature of the contracting stipulated in Chapter 8, Section 8 of Part 2 of the Civil Code is completely different. If it is handled by analogy, the factory can not be responsible for the employment relationship with the workers. If the opening of a factory can be used to deny the responsibility for the employment relationship of the workers who are clearly employed, it is unreasonable in terms of reason and reason. 5. Regarding the issue of modifying the wages for statutory holidays, wages for statutory holidays are handled in accordance with the Factory Law. The instruction only stipulates the standard for wage payment in order to avoid disputes. The petitioner again used the fact that the factory inspection implementation procedures were included in the third phase as an excuse and wanted to change the principle and stipulate it as a holiday without pay, which is very inappropriate. As for what is listed in Part B, it has nothing to do with the original disposition of the instruction and is another issue. It should not be included in the scope of the petition. The petitioner's procedures are wrong and it is difficult to deal with the conclusion on the base. The petition in this case is unreasonable. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the first half of Article 8 of the amended Petition Law, the decision is made as the main text. Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun, April of the 26th year of the Republic of China. If the petitioner in this case is dissatisfied, he/she is limited to filing a re-petition with the Ministry of Industry within 30 days from the day after the decision is served.</p>

<h3>US Fleet Commander Yarnell Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>29 US Ships Moored in the Huangpu River - Going to Yantai for Exercises on the 4th of Next Month</p>
<p>US Far East Fleet Commander General Yarnell arrived in Shanghai at 8:30 AM yesterday morning on the cruiser Augusta from Hong Kong. At the same time, ten US ships also arrived in Shanghai.

<h3>The Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Association Telegrams the Executive Yuan Again</h3>
<p>Reconsider the Tax Exemption for Foreign Rice</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, after the Executive Yuan discussed the issue of opposing the tax exemption for foreign rice in Guangdong, it was transferred to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for review. The Ministry of Finance approved Guangdong Province's request to continue to import 4 million dan tax-free as originally planned. In order to continue to fight for this issue, the Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Association of this city telegraphed the Executive Yuan again, requesting reconsideration in order to maintain the difficulties of merchants and express the rural economy. The original telegram reads: To Acting Premier Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Guangdong Province requested tax-free import of foreign rice and grain in order to relieve the needs of the spring and summer harvest. However, more than 2 million dan of rice from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities are waiting to be shipped to Guangdong, and more than 10 million dan of rice are in stock, which is more than enough to supply. Since January, officials and people from all provinces have been fighting hard. We have been honored by your hospital's discussion and transfer of the issue to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for telecommunications review, seeking a way to be fair and just, and we see your concern for the national economy and your magnanimity. However, according to reports, the Ministry of Finance's proposed import quota has been reduced to 1 million dan. After consultations with Guangdong Province, no agreement was reached and the original plan of 4 million dan was maintained. Reading this, we are deeply shocked. We have explained the details of the advantages and disadvantages of this matter in previous telegrams, so we will not repeat them here. However, the intention of the association is that Guangdong Province's so-called spring and summer harvest refers to May and June. Now that April is coming to an end, the 1 million dan of tax-free imported foreign rice that has become a reality is enough to meet the needs of May. As for the needs of June, foreign rice must no longer be allowed to continue to be imported tax-free. The provinces in the producing areas can be responsible for guaranteeing that their rice waiting to be shipped and surplus rice will be continuously transported to relieve the shortage, so that the central government's good intentions for relieving the people's food in Guangdong Province and protecting domestic agricultural products can be achieved. If the reported opinion is based on facts, it is a direct distortion of Guangdong Province's one-sided intentions, ignoring the requests of the governments of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces, ignoring the appeals of farmers and merchants in various provinces and cities, and ignoring the integrity of tariffs and the national economy. What will be left of the country's laws and the government's credibility? Therefore, we urge you to propose reconsideration at the routine meeting, make an overall plan, make a decisive decision without hesitation, and maintain the foundation of the country. The Shanghai Bean Trade Association and the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Trade Association respectfully bow.</p>
<h3>Tramcars at the Boundary of the Two Concessions Resumed Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, after the British-owned tram company in the Public Concession resolved the labor unrest, vehicles on all roads in the concession ran as usual the day before yesterday. However, the No. 2, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 8 trams, which connect the Public Concession and the French Concession, and the No. 14, No. 15, No. 16, No. 17, No. 18, and No. 19 trolleybuses were delayed until 6:00 AM yesterday before resuming normal operation because the issuance of boundary tickets and the procedures for changing addresses could not be rushed. The British and French tram companies originally signed an agreement stipulating that if either party suffers accidental damage in business, the party that caused the accident shall subsidize the losses of the party that suffered the loss. The British tram company's labor unrest this time shall compensate the French company for the losses, calculated from the date the labor unrest occurred to the date it was resolved, in accordance with the agreement. Rumors that the French Concession stopped traffic due to negotiations between the two companies on compensation for losses are false.</p>
<h3>German Ambassador Visited the Municipal Hospital Yesterday</h3>
<p>German Ambassador to Asia, Dr. Trautmann, accompanied by German Consul to Shanghai, Dr. Banhardt, visited the Shanghai Municipal Hospital in the city center at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 24th). The hospital's director, Weng Zhilong, led them to visit the various departments, wards, operating rooms, kitchens, and other places in the hospital. Dr. Trautmann and Dr. Banhardt spoke highly of the hospital's various facilities and praised it as one of the rare hospitals run by the Chinese people themselves.</p>
<h3>The Hainan Island Li and Miao Exhibition Was Crowded with Visitors Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Museum Was Overwhelmed</p>
<p>Following the Cultural and Educational Center's counterfeit money exhibition, the Municipal Museum held a Li and Miao folk exhibition on Hainan Island (i.e., Qiongyai Island), which attracted the attention of the general public. One reason is that the development of Qiongyai has been widely publicized, and the other is that the island is China's only tropical region, and all its customs, people, and products are very different from the mainland, and the living conditions of the uncivilized ethnic groups are particularly touching and arouse curiosity. According to visitors to the museum yesterday, they felt that clothing was the most fascinating. The beauty of the patterns on the barrel skirts was mistaken for ancient Egyptian tomb paintings. Other items, such as the exquisite bamboo hats and the unique hairpins, show considerable skill. Yesterday was the fourth day of the exhibition. Because the closing date was approaching, the weather was cloudy and rainy, and the crowd was extremely crowded. By 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the order was difficult to maintain. It was found that the exhibition site was still in the lecture hall at the north end of the museum. Although the layout was very orderly, the area was too small, so it was not easy to accommodate a large number of people. I hope that the museum will open the reading room at the south end as a second venue for future special exhibitions, so that the order will be easier to maintain and the audience will feel more comfortable. The beautiful and pleasing display methods of the museum are the most appreciated by the general public.</p>
<h3>각 륜선 회사 운임 증가 1할</h3>
<p>5월 1일부터 실행</p>
<p>신신사 보도에 따르면, 국영 초상국, 태고 륜선 회사, 이화 양행, 삼북 회사, 일청 회사 등에서 최근 륜선 응용 물자의 가격이 폭등함에 따라 5월 1일부터 남북양 각 항구의 운임을 일률적으로 원가에서 1할 인상하기로 결정했다고 한다. 그 광고 내용을 기록하면 다음과 같다. "최근 물가가 폭등하여 모든 륜선 응용 물자, 즉 강철, 오금, 연료 등의 가격이 모두 끝없이 상승하고 있으며, 용선 가격 또한 5할에서 7할까지 인상되었다. 항운 개지(航運開支)가 이미 막대해졌고, 원가 또한 따라서 증가하고 있다. 그러나 폐사(敝社) 등의 운임 가격은 너무 낮아 수입이 미미하고, 손실이 막대하다. 힘껏 지탱해 왔지만, 실질적으로 유지가 어렵다고 느껴 폐사 등은 회의를 거쳐 5월 1일부터 남북양 각 항구의 운임을 일률적으로 원가에서 1할 인상하여 개지를 유지하고 손실을 보충하기로 결정했다. 부득이한 조치이오니 살펴주시고, 양해해 주시기를 바란다. 특별히 미리 알린다."</p>
<h3>또 일본 낭인이 관원을 구타</h3>
<p>중앙사 보도에 따르면, 일본 륜선 나가사키마루가 13일 저녁 8시경에 일본에서 상해에 도착하여 휘산 부두에 정박했다. 해관 인원이 관례에 따라 등륜하여 조사했는데, 초사반 제2반 주임 왕흥양이 관원들을 인솔하여 등륜 작업을 진행했다. 해당 륜선에서 대량의 인조견사와 일본 술을 찾아내 즉시 운반하여 해관으로 운송하려 했다. 시간이 이미 10시였고, 행리반 수문 관원 증가동, 심혜인이 갑자기 어떤 일본인이 일본 술 수 병을 들고 급히 뛰쳐나가는 것을 목격하고 즉시 다가가 조사하려 했다. 그러자 해당 일본인은 검사를 거부하고 주먹을 휘두르며 공격했고, 동시에 대량의 일본 낭인 2, 30명이 벌떼처럼 몰려와 몽둥이와 쇠붙이를 들고 조심(曹沈) 두 사람을 맹렬히 공격했다. 조심은 해관 자동차로 도망쳤지만, 일본 낭인은 끝까지 추격하여 조심의 머리를 때려 상처를 입혔다. 조심은 다시 부두로 도망쳤지만, 일본 낭인은 여전히 포기하지 않고 조심을 강물에 밀어 넣으려 했다. 다행히 해당 반 부주임 왕문준이 달려와 조심을 구출하고 일본 낭인에게 책망하자, 해당 낭인들은 그제야 마지못해 떠나갔다. 관원은 즉시 조심을 산동로 인제 병원으로 보내 상처를 검사받게 했고, 치료 후 병원에서 하룻밤을 묵게 했다. 어제 아침 해관 의사의 치료를 받은 후에야 집으로 돌려보내 휴양하게 했다. 이번 일본 낭인의 흉악한 행위는 계획적인 예모로, 전체 관원들은 극도로 분개하고 있으며, 곧 어떤 입장을 표명할 것이다. 어제 각 방면에서 소식을 듣고 잇달아 위로 서신과 전보를 보냈다.</p>
<h3>일본 외무성이 상해에 경제 조사부를 설치할 예정</h3>
<p>일본 만주 일일 신문 보도에 따르면, 정부는 중일 경제 협력 촉진이라는 기정 국책을 수행하기 위해 각종 작업을 준비하고 있다. 사토 외상은 중국 경제 재정을 조사하기 위해 주화 대사관 내에 경제 조사부를 신설할 예정이다. 해당 부서는 상해에 설치될 예정이며, 최근 오카모토 참사관을 파견하여 정식으로 취임하게 할 예정이다. 동시에 미쓰이, 미쓰비시, 정금, 만철 등 상해 조사 기관과 긴밀하게 연락할 것이다. 또한 주화 대사관 기구 또한 개편될 예정인데, 대사 아래에 3명의 참사관을 두고 남경, 상해, 북평 3곳에 상주하게 할 것이다. 남경에 주재하는 자는 외교 사무를 담당하고, 상해는 경제 조사 정보 등 사무를 담당하며, 북평은 화북 업무 관계 등 사무를 담당하여 대중국 정책의 만전을 기할 것이라고 한다.</p>
<h3>일본 대사 가와고에 조기 귀국</h3>
<p>어제 요속(僚屬) 및 공상계와 대화 문제 의견을 연구 토론</p>
<p>일본 주중 대사 가와고에 시게루는 소환되어 귀국하는데, 원래 다음 달 일에 나가사키마루를 타고 출발할 예정이었다. 어제 일 영사관 소식에 따르면, 가와고에는 27일 오후 신임 사관 참사관 겸 주경 총영사 히다카 신타로가 상해에 도착하여 회견한 후 28일 아침 상해마루를 타고 조기 귀국한다고 한다. 일 사관 육군 무관 기타, 해군 무관 혼다 및 영사 요시오카, 타지리 등은 어제 다시 가와고에를 방문하여 대화 문제에 대해 계속 연구 토론했다. 어제 저녁 7시 가와고에는 필훈로 관저에서 일교 공상계 영수를 환영하는 연회를 열어 중일 무역 협회 일본 국적 상무 이사 후나쓰 및 보쿠베, 야마모토 등 30여 명이 참석했다. 좌석에서 중일 경제 제휴에 대한 의견을 교환하고, 가와고에는 이를 근거로 귀국하여 정부에 건의할 것이라고 한다. 가와고에는 오늘 저녁 7시에 일 사령관원을 초청하여 작별 만찬을 할 예정이다.</p>
<p>동맹사 23일 본시 소식에 따르면, 가와고에 대사는 관저에서 다음과 같이 담화했다. "이번 귀국은 정부의 명령에 따른 것이며, 언제 귀임할지는 도쿄에 돌아간 후에 다시 결정해야 한다. 중일 국교 조정 교섭이 언제 다시 시작될지, 일본이 어떤 제안을 할지는 모두 귀국하여 상의한 후에 결정해야 한다. 향후 대화 교섭에 관해서는 이미 복안이 있지만, 지금은 말씀드릴 수 없다. 현재 국부(國府)가 3중 전회(三中全會) 후 대일 태도가 경화되어 모든 일을 노골적으로 비협조적인 태도를 보인다고 말하는 사람들이 많은데, 이는 사실이 아니다. 중일 국교 조절은 중국 측에서도 필요한 일이므로 중국은 소극적인 태도에서 벗어나 현상을 타개하려는 의향은 지금까지 변하지 않았다. 다만 최근 국부(國府)는 다시 교섭을 제안할 의사가 없는 것 같다. 이 시기에 중일 양국은 모두 충분히 고려해야 할 점은 국교 조절은 양국 간의 교섭이므로 일방의 의지를 전면적으로 관철하는 것은 불가능하다는 것이다. 쌍방의 희망을 조화시키고 보조를 맞추는 것 외에는 다른 방법이 없다. 중국 측은 '기동(冀東)'을 취소하고 화북 현상(찰북 문제 및 밀수 문제)을 타개하기를 간절히 희망하고 있지만, 관세 등에 관해서는 양보할 의향이 있다. 나는 여러 차례 정 외교부장에게 중국에 가장 필요한 것은 일본의 정당한 인식을 멈출 수 없는 생존 및 성장 정세라는 점을 분명히 말해 왔다. 일본은 중국의 통일적 경향과 국부의 성장을 정확하게 인식하고, 국부의 실상과 각 부문의 성장을 철저히 연구하는 것이 가장 필요한 일이다. 다시 말해, 일본은 중국 통일의 성격을 충분히 파악하는 것을 선결 조건으로 삼아야 한다고 믿는다. 이러한 근거가 없으면 국교 조절의 길이 어렵고, 경제 제휴 등은 향후 문제이다. 무역 추이는 비관적으로 볼 필요가 없다. 양국 제휴의 미래를 고려하려면 근본적인 준비가 필요하다. 최근 중러 접근 또는 중영 협력설이 유행하고 있지만, 대화 문제는 중국을 중심으로 한 국제 관계이므로 중일 교섭 시 일본과 중국은 당연히 제3국의 동향을 고려해야 한다. 소위 영일 대화 협력설은 남경에서는 영국 측이 이러한 의향을 가지고 있다고 느끼지 못한다."</p>
<h3>금산 동향회 회원 모집</h3>
<p>6월 6일 창립 대회 개최</p>

<h3>동업자가 공회에 가입하지 않아도 납부 의무 면제 불가</h3>
<p>선저(鮮猪) 재작업 공회 순흥(順興) 안건 판결</p>
<p>본시 선저 재작채 동업 공회는 동업자인 순흥 재저작이 공회의 권유를 따르지 않고 여러 차례 가입을 거부하고 회비를 납부하지 않자, 해당 회 주석 서건장은 22년 5월 사법원 원자(院字) 제914호 해석과 23년 10월 4일 실업부 비시에 근거하여 엄격하게 가입 수속을 이행하지 않는 경우에는 당연히 이행해야 할 의무를 면제할 수 없다고 주장하며 상해 지 방법원에 소송을 제기하여 피고 순흥 재작작 주장 순체(順娣)에게 가입비 10원과 25년 8월부터 11월까지 월비 11원 5각 6분을 합하여 총 21원 5각 6분을 지급하라고 판결할 것을 요청했다. 해당 안건은 왕군의(王君毅) 추사가 2차례 심리했으며, 원고 측은 공회 총간사 시역정(施亦政)이 대표로 출정하여 진술했고, 피고는 연호원(延胡遠) 변호사가 답변했다. 기일 선고 후 어제 판결서가 송달되었는데, 사안이 처음 있는 일이므로 원 판결서 전문을 다음과 같이 기록한다. "주문" 피고는 원고에게 국폐(國幣) 21원 5각 6분을 지급해야 한다. 본 건은 가집행을 할 수 있다. 소송 비용은 피고가 부담한다. "사실" 원고 대리인은 주문과 같은 판결을 구한다고 진술했다. 그 진술은 다음과 같다. "피고는 납부해야 할 가입비 10원과 민국 25년 8월부터 11월까지 월비 총 11원 5각 6분을 납부하지 않고, 여러 차례 독촉해도 따르지 않았다. 피고는 아직 공회에 가입하지 않았다는 이유로 항변하지만, 상호(商號)가 공회 가입 수속을 게을리하는 경우에는 회비 납부 의무를 면제할 수 없다는 것은 이미 실업부가 민국 23년 10월 4일에 비시(批示)한 바 있다. 피고는 가입 수속을 이행하지 않았지만, 회비를 납부해야 할 의무는 면제되지 않으므로 전액 지급하라고 판결해 주십시오." 라고 하며 정관 1부, 재작(宰作) 체납부, 재작 매월 저수(猪數)부를 증거로 제출했다. 피고 대리인은 원고의 소를 기각해 달라고 진술했다. 그 답변은 다음과 같다. "피고는 공회에 가입하지 않았으므로 회비를 부담할 의무가 없다." 라고 했다. "이유" 본 건 피고의 항변 요지는 공회에 가입하지 않았으므로 회비를 부담할 의무가 없다는 것이다. 그러나 공상 동업 공회법 제7조 법의에 따르면 상호는 해당 지역 동업 공회에 가입하지 않을 자유가 없으며, 가입 수속을 이행하지 않았다고 하여 회원이 이행해야 할 의무를 면제할 수 없다. 피고는 공회에 가입하지 않았지만, 정관에 따라 회비를 납부해야 한다. 납부해야 할 회비 금액은 이미 원고가 제출한 공회 정관, 재작 매월 저수부 및 재작 체납부를 근거로 증명되었으므로 피고에게 전액 지급을 명해야 한다. 위에서 논술한 바에 따라 원고의 소는 이유가 있으므로 민사 소송법 제389조 제1항 제5관 제78조에 따라 주문과 같이 판결한다.</p>
<h3>초상국 내하륜(內河輪) 완전 매각</h3>
<p>가장 싼 것은 겨우 400원 어제 이미 납부하고 선박 인수</p>
<p>국영 초상국은 내하 소륜(小輪) 운항을 중단한 이후 모든 소륜선을 본시 양사항(楊思港)에 집중시켜 7척은 본국 자용으로 남겨두고 나머지는 모두 입찰 매각했다. 현재 전부 매각되었는데, 가격이 매우 저렴했다. 낙찰자는 심정이(沈靜彝)가 3척을 매입했는데, 1. 이길호(利吉號)는 입찰가 400원, 2. 상부호(翔鳧號)는 입찰가 1570원, 3. 이형호(利亨號)는 입찰가 800원이었다. 영원창(永源廠)은 2척을 매입했는데, 1. 이천호(利川號)는 입찰가 520원, 2. 항인호(恒仁號)는 입찰가 960원이었다. 축명상(祝明祥)은 서순호(瑞順號) 1척을 매입했는데, 입찰가 909원 6각이었다. 진삼사(陳森士)는 하평륜(河平輪)을 2226원에 낙찰받았다. 모금상(毛金祥)은 신안륜(新安輪)을 766원에 낙찰받고, 태창륜(泰昌輪)을 726원에 낙찰받았다. 황이방(黃貽芳)은 화물선을 365원에 낙찰받았다. 이상 각 선박은 원래 항행 노선 증서와 함께 낙찰받았기 때문에 낙찰자들은 매우 기뻐했다. 어제 모두 국에 납부하고 양사항에 가서 선박을 인수했다. 현재 오금 가격이 폭등하고 있는 상황에서 낙찰자들은 설령 해체하여 판매하더라도 이익을 얻을 수 있다고 한다.</p>
<h3>경제 박사 부부 이혼 허가 판결</h3>
<p>시기징(施琦徵)과 구징추(邱澄秋)의 반목 과정 진술</p>
<p>상해서 동부로 대중리에 거주하는 오흥인(吳興人) 구징추(邱澄秋)(또는 구배란(邱培瀾))은 장년에 유미하여 경제를 연구하고 경제학 박사 영예를 얻었다. 구씨 집안과 오중(吳中) 시씨(施氏)는 원래 친척 관계였기 때문에 시성지(施省之)는 사랑하는 딸 시기징을 아내로 맞게 했다. 당시 시는 한구 초상국 국장 직을 맡고 있었기 때문에 구를 국에 천거하여 복무하게 하고 장인과 사위가 함께 일하면서 서로 도왔다. 시기징은 구징추와 결혼한 이후 아들딸을 각 1명씩 낳았는데, 딸은 이미 꽃다운 나이가 되었고 아들 구국상(邱國祥)도 17세가 되었다. 시기징은 올해 나이가 반백이고, 구징추는 겨우 45세이다. 최근 구가 다른 여자를 좋아하게 되자 시씨는 매우 불만스러워하며 함께 늙지 않기로 결심하고 변호사를 통해 제1특구 지 방법원에 구를 상대로 이혼 소송을 제기했다. 처음 법정 심문 시 시기징은 법관이 부부 반목 과정을 자백하라고 명하자 서로 얼굴을 훼손할 뿐이라고 하며 웅얼거리고 말하지 않았다. 재판정에서 방청을 금지한 후에야 이혼을 요구하는 이유를 밝혔다. 현재 해당 사건은 이미 두 차례 심문이 종결되었고, 어제 아침 팽 추사가 판결을 선고하여 시기징과 구징추의 이혼을 허가하고 소송 비용은 피고가 부담한다고 판결했다.</p>
<h3>홍환(紅丸) 범 요계생(姚桂生) 여전히 징역형 선고</h3>

<p>상주인(常州人) 요계생(姚桂生)은 홍환 제조 사건으로 특2법원에서 징역 4년 4개월과 벌금 4천 원을 선고받았다. 요는 불복하고 고3분원에 상소했지만 기각당했다. 요는 다시 최고 법원에 상소했는데, 현재 고3분원으로 환송되어 다시 심리되었다. 또한 피고 조카 요복림(姚福林)이 특2법원 형정에 요계생과 아내 만씨 및 아들 덕화가 공유 재산을 침탈했다고 자소하여 심리 결과 무죄 판결을 받은 후 요복림은 불복하고 고3분원에 상소를 제기했는데, 이미 고3분원에서 두 사건을 여러 차례 개정하여 조사 심문하고 변론을 종결했다고 선고하여 각 정을 기재 보도했다. 어제 오후 2시 반 고3분원 오정기(吳廷琪) 원장이 진왕(陳王) 두 추사와 함께 형3정에 임하여 판결했는데, 홍환 사건은 여전히 원 판결인 징역 4년 4개월과 벌금 4천 원 외에 공민권 박탈 4년이 추가되었다. 조카가 자소한 침산(侵產) 사건에 대해서는 상소를 기각한다고 판결했다. 판결 후 요계생은 법경에 의해 감수소로 압송되었다.</p>
<h3>무장 풍기 문란 사건으로 막금송(莫金松) 구속</h3>
<p>포방(捕房) 풍기 유지 구속하지 못하면 즉시 수배</p>
<p>파이크로 339호 막마기(莫馬記) 유통호(油桶號) 소주(小主) 막금송(莫金松)은 돈이 많다고 믿고 방탕하게 유흥을 즐겼다. 올해 2월 친구 왕덕선을 통해 절강로 태창대루(泰昌大樓)의 도화강(桃花江) 무청에 가서 14세 소녀 오매수(吳梅秀)와 춤을 췄다. 막은 오 여자가 예쁘고 어리다고 생각하여 왕과 함께 좋아하는 무녀 장영(張瑛)을 데리고 오매수와 함께 홍구 대여관에 가서 방을 빌려 각각 교제했다. 막은 당시 오매수를 아내로 맞아들이겠다고 속였기 때문에 오매수는 귀가 후 어머니 오서씨에게 깊이 숨겼다. 그러나 막이 한 번 맛본 후에는 버려진 물건처럼 버렸다. 오매수 어머니는 딸이 강간당했다는 것을 알아차리고 신갑(新閘) 포방에 고발했다. 파탐 옹패옥(翁佩玉)이 조사한 결과 사실로 드러났고, 풍기 문란죄로 공소했다. 여러 차례 제1특구 지 방법원에서 개정했지만 막금송은 모습을 드러내지 않았다. 명하여 체포하여 징벌하라고 명했다고 상세히 전보했다. 어제 아침 황일승(黃日昇) 추사가 다시 심리했지만 막은 여전히 회피했고, 축 변호사를 대리인으로 출정하여 막은 흥화(興化) 중흥(中興) 달걀 공장에 있어 사건에 투항할 겨를이 없다고 주장하며 기일을 연기해달라고 요청했다. 재판정에서 변호사에게 누가 위임했는지 묻자 막금송이 이번 달 21일에 직접 위임했다고 답했다. 포방 변호사 예지산(厲志山)은 본 사건은 발생 이후 피고가 이미 한 번 소환되고 두 번 체포 영장이 발부되었음에도 여전히 모습을 드러내지 않고 있다고 주장했다. 또한 소환된 증인 왕덕선과 무녀 장영 역시 모습을 보이지 않고 있다. 이는 피고가 오서씨 모녀와 화해했다고 믿고 두 증인이 법정에 증언하는 것을 은밀히 막고 있기 때문이다. 장영은 원래 상해 무청 무녀이고, 왕덕선은 북절강로 화안방(華安坊) 23호에 거주하고 있는데 지금은 어디에 있는지 알 수 없으므로 법에 따라 증인 항거에 대해 구속을 요청하고 피고 막금송에 대해서는 수배령을 내려달라고 요청했다. 황 추사는 이에 5월 1일로 기일을 변경하여 피고를 구속하고 증인을 소환하여 다시 심문하고 여전히 구속할 수 없으면 막금송에 대해 수배령을 내리기로 했다.</p>

<p>갑북(閘北) 고륜로 200호 옥내에는 꺾인 누각, 부엌, 쪽방 등이 있는 비둘기장식 거주지이다. 내부에는 장금삼(張金森)이 있는데, 2방 주인이며 아편을 흡식한다. 또한 근처 남녀들을 매일 불러 마작을 하며 용돈을 벌려고 한다. 그 집 꺾인 누각 위의 방에 세든 이해삼은 역술가인데, 약간의 글을 알고 저녁 여가 시간에는 죽림에 노는 것을 좋아한다. 도박으로 장과 언쟁을 벌여 원한을 샀다. 작년 12월 15일 문묵을 사칭하여 시 경찰국에 장금삼을 무면허 흡연하고 흡연자들에게 이익을 제공하며, 수수료를 받고 도박을 주최한다는 익명 편지를 썼다. 시 경찰국은 편지를 접수하고 이 시대에 중대한 사안이라고 판단하고 경찰을 파견하여 장금삼을 경비 사령부에 구금했다. 장은 장유인(張維仁) 명의의 흡연 사진을 제출했다. 사령부는 조사 결과 사실로 밝혀 장금삼을 보석하고 익명 편지 필적을 조사하니 이해삼이 쓴 것으로 드러나 이씨를 체포했다. 무고죄에 해당하므로 보통 형사에 해당하므로 지 방법원 검찰관에게 허구 사실 무고죄로 공소를 제기했다. 어제 오전 오 추사가 개정하여 심리한 결과 이해삼은 편지를 써서 고발한 것을 인정했다. 관은 "당신은 역술가인가, 문묵을 알아서 익명으로 고발하는데 무고죄 형벌이 매우 무겁다는 것을 아는가"라고 묻자 "장은 실제로 무면허 흡연을 하고 체포된 후 보충하여 꾸며냈다"고 답했다. 장금삼은 출정하지 않고 아내 장장씨(張蔣氏)가 대신 출정하여 "남편은 남경으로 일자리를 구하러 갔다"고 진술했다. 관은 "당신의 남편은 장금삼인데 왜 흡연 사진에는 장유인이라고 되어 있는가"라고 묻자 "저것은 남편의 어릴 적 이름이다. 해당 흡연 사진은 토행 내에서 미리 예약한 것이다. 현재 사령부에 있다"고 답했다. 집에 도박이 있느냐고 묻자 "도박은 맞지만 놀이 성격이다"고 답했다. 동거인 주수평(周樹平)을 심문하여 증언하게 한 결과 장금삼은 장유인 명의로 사진을 발급받아 흡연하고 도박은 3백 섶(剷) 정도라고 진술했다. 법정은 변론을 종결하고 27일 판결을 선고하고 피고를 압송했다.</p>
<h3>판공전(潘公展) 등이 어제 막훤원(莫萱元)을 환영하는 연회 개최</h3>
<p>막훤원 군은 복단 대학을 졸업한 후 본시(本市)에서 열심히 청년 운동을 펼쳐 조력이 컸다. 24년 봄 동쪽으로 건너가 도쿄 와세다 대학 대학원에 입학하여 금융 재정을 연구하고 최근 학업을 마치고 귀국하여 며칠 전 상해에 도착했다. 본시 당정 문화 교육 각계는 어제 오후 7시 팔선교(八仙橋) 청년회에서 막 군을 환영하는 연회를 개최했는데, 판공전, 장병휘(張秉輝), 장익(章益), 여남추(余楠秋), 원철(袁哲), 이보침(李寶琛), 이병환(李炳煥), 고계무(顧繼武), 이예용(易禮容), 유수여(劉修如), 정걸(鄭傑), 조패자(曹沛滋), 전식(田植), 주세보(周世輔) 등 100여 명이 참석했다. 좌중에서 판 국장이 환영사를 한 것을 제외하고도 여남추, 이병환 등이 축사를 했고, 마지막으로 막 군이 답사를 통해 지난 2년간 일본 유학 과정과 감상을 개괄적으로 설명했고 10시경에 즐거움을 다하고 흩어졌다.</p>
<h3>상해에 인사 자문 위원회가 설치될 예정</h3>
<p>민중의 절실한 문제 해결 지원</p>
<p>상해시 당부 사회 서비스처는 민중이 진학, 직업, 결혼, 건강 등 절실한 문제를 해결하는 데 도움이 되기 위해 상해 인사 자문 위원회를 조직하고 상해 인사 자문소를 설립하기로 했다. 국민사 기자는 해당 회의 현재 진행 상황을 파악하기 위해 어제 해당 처 주임 임미연(林美衍) 군을 방문하여 이야기를 나눴다. "해당 회의 목적은 전문가를 집중시켜 청소년이 진학, 결혼, 건강 등 절실한 문제를 해결하도록 지도하는 동시에 교육, 건설 실업 등 각 기관과 연락하여 인재를 구하는 사람과 일을 구하는 사람에게 의무적으로 소개하는 데 있다. 진실로 현재 국내에 실업 광풍이 만연하지만 기업가 또는 건설 당국은 일을 위해 사람을 선택하는 데 어려움을 겪고 있으며, 인재를 구하는 데 어려움을 겪거나 개인적인 추천만으로는 재능을 발휘하기 어렵다는 탄식이 많다. 따라서 의무적이고 공개적인 인사 자문 기관을 상해에 설립하는 것이 필요하다고 생각한다." 임씨는 기자에게 해당 회의 장정은 이미 시 당부 집행 위원회를 통과했으며, 도백천(陶百川), 강호(姜豪), 왕만운(汪曼雲), 임미연, 양가린(楊家麟), 오항여(吳恒如), 장건백(蔣建白), 장병휘, 전승서(錢承緒), 낙청화(駱清華), 김윤상(金潤祥), 호단행(胡端行), 정앙해(程仰垓), 도광천(陶廣川), 가불여(賈佛如), 임극총(林克聰), 왕소제(王紹齊), 이겸약(李謙若), 육자동(陸子冬), 오대의(吳戴儀), 제문기(諸文綺), 양관북(楊管北), 육은경(陸隱耕), 고㐻원(顧㐻元), 하청유(何清儒) 등 25명을 해당 회 위원으로 임명했으며, 도백천을 주임 위원, 강호, 주만운을 부주임 위원으로 지정했다. 이 항 임명장은 이미 시 당부 집행 위원회에서 발송되었으며, 현재 적극적으로 준비하여 최대한 빠른 시일 내에 상해를 설립하고 인사 자문소를 설립하여 해당 회 규정에 따른 각종 사업을 처리할 예정이다."</p>
<h3>중산로 옆에 용화원(龍華園) 개척</h3>
<p>유람객 휴식 제공 신생활 실천</p>
<p>본시 용화진(龍華鎮)은 교통이 편리하고 풍경이 매우 아름답다. 지금은 봄이 되어 둑가에 복숭아나무와 버드나무가 활짝 피어 붉은색과 녹색이 빛을 발하며 볼만하다. 아쉽게도 해당 진 근처에는 조용하고 한적한 원장이 없어 휴식을 취할 수 없다. 이에 상계 영수 심구성(沈九成), 동행손(董杏蓀) 등이 동지 10여 명을 초대하여 용화원 개척에 자금을 지원하고 중산로 22호에 부지를 구입하여 진행해 온 지 1년이 다 되어간다. 어제 가보니 원경 배치가 이미 규모를 갖추고 있었다. 사승(嗣承) 양백란(楊伯蘭) 주임이 해당 원 계획과 취지를 다음과 같이 설명했다. "해당 원은 약 80여 무를 차지하고 있으며 남쪽으로는 천요교로(天鑰橋路)와 통하고 현재 공사는 대청, 정자, 포장 도로 건설 및 화초 심기 등이다. 북부는 생생 우유 회사의 제4 소 밭이며 앞으로 유람객은 신선한 우유를 맛볼 수 있다. 잔디밭이 특히 많아 유람객과 단체가 어디든 쉬어갈 수 있도록 준비되어 있으며 음식 등 부서는 경제적이고 실용적인 것을 주旨로 하고 일률적으로 소계 등 추가 손실을 폐지하여 해당 원을 평민화, 대중화할 것이다. 개지는 절약하는 것 외에 부족한 부분은 각 발기인이 보조하고 유람객에게 받지 않을 것이며 개인 화원을 제공하여 대중에게 신생활 주의를 실천하려 한다."</p>

<p>북경로 청원리(清遠里)로 결정 5월 1일부터 영업 시작</p>
<p>광서성 당국은 최근 국산품 장려 및 공장 설립에 온 힘을 쏟고 있다. 먼저 귀현 제당 공장, 류주 알코올 공장, 빈양 도자기 공장, 오주 정유 공장 등을 설립하여 생산품이 매우 좋다. 이후 23년 겨울 광서 출입구 무역처를 설립했는데, 생산품 부분은 동유, 회유, 주석, 텅스텐 안티몬, 망간 및 기타 제품을 대량 판매하고 수입 부분은 전 성에서 필요한 물품과 원자재를 구매하고 매년 영업 총액이 2천만 원이 넘는다. 해당 처 조직은 총처를 광서 오주에 두고 분처를 하현(賀縣), 용주(龍州), 광주, 홍콩 등에 두고 있다. 최근 상해 방면에 분처를 설립하기로 결정하고 육웅림(陸雄林)을 상해 분처 주임으로 파견하여 설립을 준비하고 있다. 처소는 이미 북경로 청원리 10호로 임대했으며 현재 각 항 준비 작업이 거의 완료되어 5월 1일에 정식으로 설립할 예정이다.</p>

<h3>Fraudulent Acquisition of Property by Impersonating Others: Xue Xinqiu and Wife Committing Crimes Together</h3>
<p>Xue Could Not Deny, Still Subject to Penalties; Xue Wu Shi Granted Leniency with a Suspended Sentence</p>
<p>Xue Xinqiu, a Wuxi native and former employee of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society who had already been dismissed, and his wife, Xue Wu Shi, had previously repeatedly used the names of Ye Jitang and Zhu Zhongchang, etc., to borrow money from Zhang Qinghua, a Wuxi woman residing at No. 24, Lane 1603, Jing'an Temple Road, totaling 1,600 yuan. Subsequently, Zhang discovered that the so-called Ye and Zhu had not actually borrowed any money, and that it was entirely a fraudulent scheme by the Xue couple using false names. She reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest the Xue couple and hand them over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This matter has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial in the eighth criminal court. The defendants hired lawyer Yan Eson for their defense. First, lawyer Li Zhishan from the police station stated that during the adjournment, the police station also found that the defendant had borrowed 1,000 yuan from Zhang last November 27th under the name of Zhou Zhiqing, an employee of the Bank of Communications. However, according to the police investigation, there was no such person as Zhou in the Bank of Communications, and the defendant's actual actions were far more than this. The defendant was obviously specializing in fraudulent acquisition of property by impersonating others. Moreover, the seals of the guarantors listed on the promissory notes for the loan to the plaintiff were all copied from the defendant's residence. This further proves the defendant's guilt, etc. Subsequently, Ye Jitang and Zhu Zhongchang filed a case to prove that they had not entrusted Xue Xinqiu to borrow money from the plaintiff, and that Xue was impersonating them, etc. When questioned, Xue Xinqiu still claimed that this matter was solely done by his wife, and Xue Wu Shi also fully admitted that she had borrowed money from the plaintiff under a false name, and had already lost it in gambling. She also pointed out that the interest on the loan from the plaintiff was as high as eight percent. After mutual arguments by the two lawyers, Judge Huang announced the verdict in court: Xue Xinqiu and Xue Wu Shi were jointly sentenced to six months of imprisonment for continuously using forged private documents. Xue Wu Shi was granted a two-year suspended sentence, and the seals, etc., were confiscated.</p>

<h3>A Double Delightful Affair: Young Man Detained by Police</h3>
<p>Zhang Zimei Files a Complaint Seeking His Daughter; Bao Lian'gen's Joy Turns to Sorrow</p>
<p>Zhang Zimei, a native of Shaoxing, is 61 years old and has two daughters. The elder daughter, A'duo, is currently 17 years old, and the younger daughter, Aifei (also known as Xiao Duo), is currently 16 years old. Due to the family's poverty, Zhang ordered Aifei to learn dancing. After completing her studies, she worked as a dancing girl at the Taohua Jiang Dance Hall in the Taichang Building on Zhejiang Road. The father and daughters all lived together in the back building of No. 387 Qipu Road. Bao Lian'gen, a 24-year-old floating youth and the second landlord of the house, does not engage in honest work. Because he saw the Zhang sisters day and night, he had evil thoughts. In June of last year, he tried to seduce Zhang A'duo and engaged in illicit behavior with her. Not satisfied, in July, he seduced Zhang Aifei and committed adultery with her. Afterwards, Bao repeatedly seduced the Zhang sisters to go out to hotels and continue to commit adultery. Although Bao enjoyed a double delight and experienced extreme pleasure, Zhang Zimei was kept in the dark and was completely unaware until June of this year. Aifei's wristwatch, which she wore daily, was also tricked by Bao into being pawned and used, which led to Zhang Zimei discovering the matter and a dispute arising. From then on, Bao returned home and disappeared without a trace. Zhang A'duo, however, was four months pregnant. On the night of the 20th of this month, at about 2:00 AM, Bao suddenly went to the Taohua Jiang Dance Hall and took Zhang Aifei out together, going to Room 208 of the Daxin Hotel at No. 442 Guangxi Road to continue their secret affair and not allowing Zhang to return home. The next day, Zhang Zimei did not see her daughter return home, so she went to Taohua Jiang to inquire. Another dancing girl, Hu Na, told her the whole story. Zhang immediately reported it to the police station, requesting an investigation and arrest. However, Bao's whereabouts were unknown, and he could not be found until 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. Zhang Zimei happened to meet Bao Lian'gen at the intersection of Niuzhuang Road and Guangxi Road, so she called for a Chinese policeman from No. 2224 to come and arrest him at the Laozha Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Zhang Yuanjing and Detective Wu Shoushan, the facts were confirmed. It was also found that Bao had used the alias Jin Amao at the Daxin Hotel on the 20th. Bao was then detained, and yesterday morning he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted him for the crime of disrupting public morals under Article 227 of the Criminal Law. Judge Feng Shide, considering the case involved public morals, ordered a ban on spectators, so the details of the trial and the outcome are unknown. The hearing was postponed.</p>

<p>At about 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Yang Zhongquan, the police chief of Yangjiadu Police Station in Pudong, received a report that several robbers were plotting a robbery at the Weng Shunxing Teahouse in Yujiamiao. He immediately ordered detectives Cui Youkui, Cheng Peizhang, etc., to rush to search. There were a total of four robbers, sitting around a table and chatting. One of the robbers saw the detectives coming and ran away first. The remaining three robbers were captured on the spot, and a six-inch Browning pistol, serial number 32321, containing three live rounds, was found next to one of them. The people and the gun were taken to the police station. The robber carrying the gun confessed his name was Wu Xiaomao, 24 years old, from Taizhou. The other two criminals were Yang Maogou, 33 years old, local, and Xu Songlin, 30 years old, local. The three criminals admitted that they were planning to rob a certain family in Niujiaojian, east of Tangqiao Yanjiuqiao, that evening. The fugitive was named Baba, etc. Yang also confessed that on January 20th of this year, at 2:00 AM, the three of us and several other fugitives robbed Feng Zhen's house at No. 24, Jiande Lane, West Sanli Bridge, Nanmatou, and stole two gold rings, and shot a neighbor, Xu Jiufu, in the right leg. Wu confessed that he denied participating in the West Sanli Bridge robbery, but claimed that on the 10th of this month, a group of six of us, including the fugitive Baba and the leader, etc., robbed Jia Jinfang, a member of the Jiajiajiao Security Corps in Yangjing, late at night, and stole a grey squirrel fur coat and two pairs of gold earrings, and several yuan in cash. The fur coat was pawned at Xinchang Pawnshop on Yangjiadu Road, etc. After verifying the confessions, the police chief ordered the three criminals to be sent to the Police Bureau for interrogation yesterday afternoon, along with the recovered stolen fur coat. The owner was notified to identify the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Gu Huangshi's House</p>
<p>Gu Huangshi (35 years old, a widow from Songjiang whose husband recently passed away), residing at No. 10, Lane 183, Shangwen Road, Xiaoximen, Hunan, was visited at 2:00 PM yesterday by two people wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, and one person wearing a yellow short coat, speaking in a local accent, claiming to be checking and repairing electric lights and fire alarms. They broke into the house from the front door. The two of them took out pistols and threatened (the pistols appeared to be fake), forbidding any shouting. One robber monitored the three men and women in the house, and the other two robbers went upstairs to search. They robbed more than 400 yuan in legal tender, five yuan in subsidiary currency, a pair of gold bracelets weighing one tael and six mace, two platinum watches, two gold rings, a four-yuan Yong'an Company gift certificate, a two-yuan Shanghai Bank gift certificate, six silver ingots (each weighing ten taels), a set of silver account hooks, eleven new silver dollars, more than 200 silver coins, a silver tongue scraper, and other miscellaneous items, totaling a loss of nearly 2,000 yuan. The robbers searched for more than an hour before escaping through the back door. After the police station in charge received the report, they immediately dispatched police officers to conduct a detailed investigation and began to pursue the escaped robbers for legal punishment.</p>
<p>Shu Rongsheng's House</p>
<p>Shu Rongsheng, a 42-year-old pig dealer from Funing, residing at No. 90 Zhangqiao Road, Zhabei, was invaded and robbed by three robbers at 7:20 PM on the 22nd of this month, losing over one hundred yuan in clothing and jewelry. Shu reported the case to the police for investigation. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 23rd), Shu suddenly learned that one of the robbers, He Xiaogouzi, was gambling at a gambling stall in the Dalu Fang of Zhangjiaxiang Road. Without making a sound, he secretly reported it to the police station, which dispatched Police Chief Luo Mingqi to lead police officers to arrest He. Under strict interrogation, He confessed that he had colluded with Yang Zhaoxi, who lived in the grass shed behind the Qingxiu Temple in Zhangnjujia Lane, and an unknown person, a total of three people, and robbed Shu's house with a pistol. Yesterday morning at 1:00 AM, he led the police to continue the arrest. Yang had already heard the news and fled. When the detectives went to Xiangwu Terrace to arrest the gang, Detective Hu Daoxi was suddenly beaten in the lips and cheeks by Dai Xiaowuzi, a Funing native, and bled profusely. The assailant, Dai Xiaowuzi, was detained by the police for interrogation. As for the arrest of He, along with Yang Zhaoxi's photos and other evidence, they were transferred to the local court for investigation.</p>

<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Offers Free Meningitis Vaccinations</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the climate in this city has been abnormal, with uneven temperatures, resulting in a surge of infectious diseases. Initially, smallpox was the most severe. However, after the Municipal Health Bureau made efforts to prevent it and offered free smallpox vaccinations, the momentum gradually decreased. Unfortunately, epidemic meningitis has also become prevalent recently. According to investigations, the number of patients with this disease this spring is very large, which is unprecedented in recent years. In view of this, the Municipal Health Bureau, in addition to ordering the Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital to increase temporary beds for meningitis patients to accommodate as many as possible, has also ordered the health centers in each district to administer free meningitis vaccinations to increase everyone's immunity. It is hoped that the public will pay attention and take precautions as soon as possible to value life.</p>
<h3>Garrison Headquarters Cracks Down on Illegal Melting of Electrical Wires</h3>
<p>Some of the Evidence Has Been Identified</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters previously received a secret report that the Qixing Copper Smelting Plant on Qimei Road, Zhabei, was illegally melting copper coins and various electrical wires for resale and profit. They ordered a special task force and an investigation team, together with the local police station, to search the plant. All the evidence was seized, and three people, including accountant Wang Xingnan, were taken to the headquarters and handed over to the military court for interrogation. It is now known that the various electrical wires seized in the plant have been certified by Wu Jiegai, director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and Shen Nanlin, the foreman of the wire workers, proving that the various electrical wires were indeed stolen from the long-distance telephone lines from Shanghai to Nanjing and various steel wires in the Nanshi District of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. In addition to taking three types of electrical wires back to the telephone bureau for verification, the copper ingots that had already been melted from copper coins have been sent to the mint for chemical testing.</p>
<h3>Water Police Chief Zhu Aizhou Protects Fishing Season and Fishing Boats</h3>
<p>Orders All Teams to Step Up Prevention; Checks Defenses and Assesses Diligence</p>
<p>Zhu Aizhou, the chief of the Third District of the Jiangsu Water Police Force, believes that as the yellow croaker fishing season approaches, the ocean surface is crowded with fishing boats from various provinces casting their nets to catch fish. Fearing that pirates may take the opportunity to sneak in, carry out robberies, and hinder fishing operations, he issued an order to all major and sub-teams under his jurisdiction yesterday to strengthen prevention and diligently protect the fishing boats. All ships with suspicious behavior must be investigated to prevent bandits from mixing in. At the same time, Chief Zhu personally went to the garrison areas of each team by patrol ship to check the defense work and assess diligence to ensure thoroughness.</p>
<h3>Japanese Dancing Teacher Komekura Induces Wealthy Women</h3>
<p>Detained and Strictly Interrogated by Japanese Police</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, the dance teaching center on the upper floor of the Donghe Theater on Zhaopur Road was suddenly closed by the Consulate General on the 17th. At the same time, the teaching license of the dance teaching center opened by Komekura Takashi from Kyoto, located in the Xinkangli of Wuchang Road, was also revoked. It was found that Komekura had no fixed residence, and his crime of inducing women was truly shocking. Under the guise of private dance instruction, since June of last year, he had been entering and leaving the home of a director of a certain company in this port, and was very close to the director's wife. One day, taking advantage of the hostess's fatigue from dancing, he plied her with alcohol and committed adultery. From then on, he took over the role of the host, and the two fell deeply in love, forming an unbreakable bond. When her husband found out, he sent the woman to Japan. Komekura, unable to continue his affair with the woman, turned to seduce the foreign wife of a director of a certain company in the French Concession using the same methods. The foreign wife possessed private wealth of over one million yuan, and the two often went out to wander, living an unusually extravagant life. He is now being detained and strictly interrogated by the Consulate General police. Because the matter concerns public morals and tarnishes the reputation of the Japanese, he will be deported from Shanghai within days.</p>
<p>According to reports, Komekura was escorted back to Japan on the Nagasaki Maru yesterday.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Facilitates Long-Distance Calls</h3>
<p>Regulations for Borrowing Phones to Take Calls</p>
<p>In order to facilitate long-distance calls, the Ministry of Communications has issued two regulations for borrowing phones to take calls, ordering all local telephone bureaus to follow them. They are transcribed as follows: ㊀ When a caller requests a long-distance call, if the receiving bureau knows that the receiver has a phone installed and does not need to send a messenger to call them, it should first call the receiver's phone directly. After the receiver answers, it should be changed to the method of calling someone to talk. However, if the receiver's phone cannot be reached, a messenger should still be sent to call them, using the method of calling someone to talk. ㊁ When a caller requests a call to be delivered via messenger and the receiving bureau does not know whether the receiver has a phone installed, after calling and not getting through, a messenger should still be sent to call them. If there is a phone installed near the receiver's residence that can be borrowed to receive long-distance calls, the receiver should write down the notification number and the caller's location on the notification slip, and write on the back of the notification slip the telephone number of the phone installed in their home or the telephone number of the borrowed phone, requesting the telephone bureau to connect the long-distance call to that phone. They should then hand the notification slip back to the original messenger and return it to the telephone bureau, and immediately go to the location where the phone is installed and report the notification number, the caller's location, their name, and the phone number of the phone they are using to the long-distance station of the telephone bureau by telephone, requesting the telephone bureau to connect the long-distance call to that phone. After the bureau verifies that there are no errors, it will connect the call quickly.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Southern Fujian Plague Prevention and Relief Committee</h3>

In addition to Chen Cheng drafting an opinion on preventing the plague and fundamentally eliminating the plague, which was distributed to all sectors as a reference for plague prevention and relief, a telegram was immediately sent to the National Government, the Military Commission, the Executive Yuan, the Health Department, and the Fujian Provincial Government, requesting the expedited dispatch of plague treatment specialists to fly to the plague-stricken areas of Southern Fujian counties to implement relief efforts. The text of the telegram is as follows: "The plague is spreading in Southern Fujian, and the people are suffering. The bad news of its expansion is being heard daily. If effective relief and prevention measures are not quickly taken, there will be no way to ensure the future. We urgently telegraph and appeal to you to expedite the dispatch of plague treatment experts with a large supply of plague relief drugs to fly to the counties of Southern Fujian to implement relief efforts, treating both the symptoms and the root causes simultaneously, eradicating the plague as soon as possible, and saving the people of Min to secure the nation. We are extremely eager to await your orders." Chairman Chen Cheng of the Jin-Hui Hall in Shanghai, Chairman Wang Pingnan of the Xing-An Hall in Shanghai, Chairman Yang Tongzeng of the Quan-Zhang Hall, and all the fellow villagers from Southern Fujian in Shanghai bow respectfully.</p>
<h3>Renji Hospital's March Report</h3>
<p>Renji Hospital's March report states: 13,392 outpatient visits, 392 new inpatients, 6,520 inpatient days, an average daily supply of meals to 463 people, 47 male suicides, 32 female suicides, 131 inpatient surgical procedures, 280 outpatient surgical procedures, 66 factory accidents, 348 patients sent by the Public Concession Police, 37 patients sent by the French Concession Police, 18 patients sent by the Chinese Public Security Bureau, 22 births, 13,784 prescriptions dispensed, and 254 radiographic and photographic examinations. Based on the above statistics, it is evident that the hospital's social services continue the usual practice of previous years. That is, in the month following the Lunar New Year holidays, the number of people coming to the hospital for treatment has increased significantly. The number of outpatient and inpatient visits, as well as the number of prescriptions dispensed, has increased by 50% compared to February. The number of inpatient days has also increased by 10% compared to February. The hospital's wards were nearly full in March, which is also indicative. The main diseases were largely the same as in the previous month, with measles, scarlet fever, and recurrent fever being quite rampant. The number of male and female suicides has nearly doubled compared to February, which is a source of sorrow in the hospital's work. The common methods used are taking an overdose of opium or similar amounts of medicine, which shows that these drugs are still very easy to obtain, costing about 30 cents a day. In March, two major hospitals were established in the Shanghai area: the Municipal Hospital in the Jiangwan Central District and the Zhongshan Hospital in Fenglinqiao. Both hospitals have comprehensive plans and the latest facilities. In addition to wishing them success, the hospital expresses its respect for their humanitarian work and is willing to offer assistance.</p>

<p>Informal Commentary</p>
<h3>The Scene of Peace After the Calamity</h3>
<p>— Nai Yi</p>
<p>Mr. Bei Quan's "Gleanings from the Yunnan Journey" states: "Although we are disturbing Mr. Kong for one night, the temple appearance has been renewed because of our transit. Mr. Kong certainly won't be offended by us. (The provincial authorities provided 3,000 yuan, and the local authorities provided 2,000 yuan for the welcoming reception and the renovation of the city. For a town after the calamity, it is quite burdensome for the people to bear 2,000 yuan.)" He also says: "The academic groups' tour and the central government officials' local inspection are very common. It is best not to have local supplies, because the supplies will labor the people. The strong men are arranged for two or three hundred li, which is a waste of the people. Especially during the busy farming season, every moment is precious. Although the provincial authorities want to show too much goodwill, it is a great loss to the people. Even those who receive it feel ashamed and embarrassed, and show a state of shrinking back. As for the conscription of laborers to carry luggage, it has not been heard that they are given pay, which is even more unsettling. As for the consumption of more than 100,000 firecrackers, who will compensate for this? ... Now, encountering such ostentatious supply for the transit of the 'bourgeois' group, won't it add a few more unfavorable impressions?" (See the 24th issue of this newspaper)</p>
<p>Mr. Bei Quan's opinion is very correct. "It is best not to have local supplies," and "Won't it add a few more unfavorable impressions?" are words spoken from the bottom of his heart. I, on the other hand, think it's not that bad. The greatest significance of the government's initiation of the Beijing-Yunnan tour this time should be to investigate the hardships of the people's livelihood along the way and the situation of construction. And the purpose of the gentlemen who joined the tour should naturally be different from ordinary sightseeing. Of course, they don't want to enjoy the welcome of "strong men arranged for two or three hundred li" and "more than 100,000 firecrackers." On the contrary, what they want to see should be some realistic lives of the people in various places without any embellishment.</p>
<p>However, now, wherever the tour group goes, the sound of firecrackers follows. The places where the tour group gentlemen sit and lie are all newly decorated, and the receptions and visits are all arranged in order and designated locations. Originally, perhaps a little farming situation could still be seen in the fields, but now, because they "want to show too much goodwill," even during the "precious farming season," the laboring people are called to "arrange for two or three hundred li" to act as the role of welcoming on both sides of the road. In this way, the original appearance is not seen, and the "suffering the pain of swelling one's face to look fat" after the calamity is increased in vain. And what benefit is there for those who want to investigate the real situation of the people's livelihood along the way?</p>
<p>So, can this hastily embracing the Buddha's feet of embellishment make the gentlemen of the tour group think that it is a reflection of a peaceful world? It is also unlikely, "The strong men along the way, because of lack of nutrition, have many pale faces, still carrying the haggard remains of the blockade area a few years ago," has been seen in "Gleanings," and not long ago, there was also an incident where the train stopped for half an hour due to bandit alerts in the front line. Now, it is even more so: "Because it was heard overnight that more than a hundred armed groups were passing through the border of Wan and Liu, it was not known whether they were civilians or bandits, and a regiment of troops was sent in advance to guard;" It can be seen that this "grand occasion" of welcome along the way is really quite a "stagehand" meaning on the stage. Once the colorful clothes on the outside are peeled off, the skinny inside is just a dirty and extremely broken cotton-padded jacket.</p>
<p>It is originally necessary for local governments to entertain and facilitate the tour groups organized by the central government, and to do their best as hosts. However, this entertainment and welcome should be very sincere to tell the guests about the various realities of the jurisdiction, so that they can understand the suffering and also let them know the benefits. Even if there are bad places, it is okay to explain the ins and outs, as well as the plan for future improvement, so that the inspectors can see the original appearance clearly, and perhaps have some opinions and contributions in the future. If they are embellished in every possible way, and in fact, they cannot be concealed, then I am afraid that what they see will not only be regarded as worthless by the concealers, but even the benefits will be regarded as败絮(used cotton) in the broken cotton-padded jacket.</p>
<h3>Strange Case of a Woman Disguised as a Man in London</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent</p>
<p>The Marlborough Street Police Court in London recently heard a theft case. The defendant was a woman disguised as a man, and she had even married another woman as husband and wife. Her name was Smith, she was forty-two years old, and she was working as a servant in the Scott family in London. She was charged with stealing five one-pound banknotes belonging to her mistress. She confessed to the crime, and the court sentenced her to pay a fine of twenty shillings and 5 pounds for litigation costs to close the case. When she appeared in court, she was wearing a blue men's coat, brown woolen women's trousers, and a black felt women's hat. She hired lawyer Coleman as her defense counsel, and the plaintiff's lawyer was Mr. Wynn.</p>
<p>According to lawyer Wynn's statement in court: "Mrs. Scott published an advertisement in the newspaper in August last year to recruit a male servant. Smith came to recommend himself, claiming that he had a wife who had passed away, and had a diligent service certificate given by his former employer. Mrs. Scott was satisfied and hired him. At that time, the whole family thought that Smith was a man, without any suspicion. Smith was very attentive to his work on weekdays and was very popular with his master. On March 14 of this year, Mrs. Scott found that five banknotes were missing from the purse she put in the bedroom, so she questioned Smith. Smith initially denied the theft, but later admitted it."</p>
<p>Next, the head of detectives testified: "The defendant married Lieutenant Smith in the Australian army in April 1918, and only lived together for six months. Later, she lived with an Australian soldier named Crowhurst and had two illegitimate children. In 1923, she separated from Crowhurst and went to Brighton, living in a hotel with a Ms. Hewitt. At that time, she had changed into men's clothing, calling herself Sir Victor, and the lady called herself Mrs. Barker. Until April 16, 1929, she was sentenced to eight months in prison by the Central Criminal Court because she had made false statements when registering her marriage. It turned out that in November 1923, she married Ms. Hewitt as husband and wife under the name of Victor Barker. In 1926, she went from Brighton to Andover, but removed the title of Sir and changed it to the title of 'Captain'. They opened an old furniture store. Captain Barker also joined the local baseball club, and also rode horses to hunt, without revealing any female flaws. The defendant also joined the Mrs. Campbell's Drama Company and acted in several plays as a male actor. In 1925, when she pretended to be Sir Victor Barker, she was sued by the creditor for owing 40 pounds for men's clothing. The court ordered her to pay it back in twelve months. In early 1926, she got the position of manager of the Enkefeldt Manor. Not long after, she resigned. Later, she separated from Ms. Hewitt. In 1927</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>In the early years, she participated in the Kensington National Fascist Movement under the name of Captain Barker. She was wearing military uniform and military badges on her chest. She also served as a secretary in a major organ of the Fascist group. After the Hogarth Road Fascist headquarters was searched, she was summoned to court for violating the armed forces law. On July 11, 1927, she was charged with two counts of crime in the Central Criminal Court, (1) using false documents in an attempt to confuse, (2) attempting to deceive. Later, due to insufficient evidence, she was acquitted. At this time, she covered her eyes with cloth and was supported to the court by a friend. It is said that Captain Barker was injured in the war, and his eyes were temporarily blind. The doctor had told "him" that if his nerves were slightly stimulated, the old illness would relapse. Not long after, her brother died, and she got about 1,000 pounds of this property. She rented a floor in Hertford Street and lived with an actress, calling them husband and wife. In January 1928, she changed her name to Colonel Barker and opened a coffee shop, but because the business was not good, a bankruptcy lawsuit occurred later. On September 15, 1928, she worked as a receptionist in the Regent Palace Hotel, with a weekly salary of 5 pounds. She left this occupation only after being arrested by the small accounts staff. In February 1932, she was employed by a car manager company. In July, she was fired because of layoffs. When she was on the job, she did a lot of work in soliciting business, so the manager valued her very much. In the early days of 1934, she lived with a woman and a child in a house in Regent's Park. People thought that was "his" wife and children. Because she owed 70 gold pounds to local shops, she suddenly moved away. This year, she changed her name to Hill and went to Hayenfield, working in a dog kennel. Because of excessive drinking, she was fired by the owner. Later, she found a job in a chicken farm and was dismissed again because she was dissatisfied with the owner. Later, she also served as a company head. When she was in Camden Town, she called herself Sir Hill and walked with a cane. It is said that it was because her legs were injured in the war, and she had difficulty walking. It was not until she worked as a male servant in Mrs. Scott's house that she was discovered to be a woman."</p>
<p>The interrogating officer then asked: "Is she disguised as a man because of a quirk? Or is there another purpose?"</p>
<p>Lawyer Wynn replied: "We don't know, she has been disguised for many years.</p>
<p>Defendant's lawyer Coleman then stepped forward and said: "The defendant has only committed one crime before, which is completely unrelated to this case. She admits that she took Mrs. Scott's banknotes. She worked very diligently in the mistress's house. In December last year, she was in debt for many medical expenses because she was ill, so she was extremely embarrassed. If she was greedy for money, she could have stolen a larger amount. She only had evil intentions when she had no other choice. As for her disguise as a man, she told me that there was a reason, and she was unwilling to reveal it at this time. If I can tell the court this reason, it will definitely show sympathy for her."</p>
<p>The interrogating officer said: "I don't need to investigate the matter of her disguising as a man." So he spoke to the defendant Smith: "You admitted that you stole five pounds of banknotes, which is the case I should try. The detective chief just explained your resume in detail, which makes me think that you are a hardworking woman. You stole it because you were short of money. Many innocent and good people have also encountered the same fate as you. You have only committed a crime of lying and registering once in your life, which is completely different from theft. If you can find a more honest job in the future and be a woman in a proper manner, don't dress up as a man like you are now. You can go see the female probation officer, I think she will definitely do her best to help you.</p>
<h3>Rain</h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>I gently opened the window curtain with a fluke heart. It was a cloudy sky. Raindrops hit the glass window like gossamer threads. The clear glass was as chaotic as ruts; at the same time, it disturbed my heart.</p>
<p>"It's raining again. How long will it continue?"</p>
<p>I whispered in my heart. I closed the window curtain, hoping it would isolate me from afar.</p>
<p>I hope there is a sunny day!</p>
<p>The house is damp and overflowing. Since the day it rained, I haven't torn off the calendar on the wall - the days that have passed seem even more gloomy.</p>
<p>The raincoat in the writing chair is tired and lying like a snail. Three days ago, I wore it and walked a long way to visit a friend's illness.</p>
<p>-He was lying on a narrow army bed, his face pale, like the gloomy sky. He told me panting; he has been sick for nearly a week, and no one has visited him, and he has not asked a doctor to diagnose him. The kind-hearted second landlord cooks him a pot of porridge every day and measures the heat on his forehead with his rough palms.</p>
<p>-Sometimes, a heart is like being fried in a frying pan, and the whole body is like a bomb about to explode; sometimes, it falls into an ice cellar, and the blood seems to stop circulating.</p>
<p>-"I want to go home!" My mother would hug me in her arms and call my pet name; my sister would tell me a story; even if my father was angry that I wouldn't listen to him, he would ask a doctor for me.</p>
<p>-"I want to go home!"</p>
<p>I sat opposite him, listening to his complaints. I had forgotten to comfort him with the enthusiasm of friendship. I forgot that I came to visit a poor friend's illness.</p>
<p>When he fell asleep, I secretly escaped.</p>
<p>The rain continued, and the sky weaved a fluttering net. I walked alone along the desolate road. I let the cold raindrops hit my scorched forehead, and let the ruthless raindrops erode my about-to-be-broken raincoat. It was already dusk, and I was walking the opposite way home.</p>
<p>The street lights were on, and I noticed that the poplars beside the street were drawing out tender green branches and leaves in the rain. They were dancing and nodding to me.</p>
<p>"Go home, I also have a warm home!"</p>
<p>-The field is emerald green, and the distant mountains are faintly visible in the smoky rain. A farmer wearing a bamboo hat and a raincoat has just fully loaded fresh fish from the pond, running along the fish pond as if flying. When he is near the door, he calls his wife's name and asks her to go to town to buy a catty of wine.</p>
<p>-There is a fresh and fat fish for dinner. After drinking two cups of wine, he pointed to the fish with green bamboo chopsticks and said:</p>
<p>-"The rain is good this year, the fish in the pond are thriving, everyone eat a little..."</p>
<p>-"The fields can also be planted with seedlings. With such good rain, don't be afraid of another prosperous year!"</p>
<p>-Listening to the rain hitting the thatched roof, I fell asleep with a beautiful dream.</p>
<p>I finally returned home. I took off my dripping raincoat, threw it in the writing chair, and lay down on the bed, not knowing if I had eaten dinner.</p>
<p>I didn't sleep well all night, and the fluttering rain seemed to be hammering my heart.</p>
<p>How long will it continue?</p>
<p>I hope there is a sunny day!</p>
