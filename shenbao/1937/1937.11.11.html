<h3>敵軍猛犯日暉港</h3>
<p>我憑堅固工事應戰　敵雖頑强終未得手</p>
<p>敵猛犯日暉港未逞</p>
<p>軍息、敵軍約一聯隊、於昨晨六時、在坦克車六輛之掩護下、沿斜十路東來、向我日暉港之綫進化、我軍憑堅强之工事、沉着應戰、見敵行近沿岸、卽以機關槍掃射、敵軍多人、應聲而倒、敵見我有備、頑鬥約二小時、終未得逞、</p>

<h3>敵在開平碼頭登陸</h3>

<h3>米市渡敵陷重圍受重創</h3>
<p>華漕鎮東我殺敵百餘人</p>

<p>駛近封鎖綫企圖襲南市　昨晚九時許會猛烈攻擊</p>
<p>我南市軍警、奉最高當局命固守南市區域後、敵軍對之頗感焦慮、故於昨日午後二時四十分起、除派大批飛機前往投彈轟炸、企圖破壞外、又於午後五時許、停泊公和祥碼頭江面之敵軍淺水砲艦一艘、竟越英美法各國艦隊防區、駛至十六舖金利源碼頭江面停泊、離我封鎖綫僅百米、期實行從浦江轟擊南市征圖、當時該地一帶居民、見敵艦突然駛至、咸呈恐慌、</p>
<p>紛紛搬塲遷移、十六舖一帶魚行、亦均提早停市、同時法租界當局得悉後、特加派軍警前往十六舖一帶嚴密駐守、藉資防範、至我南市方面軍警對敵軍企圖、早已洞悉、故已在各據點加緊防備、如敵軍進犯、决予迎頭痛擊、至晚九時二十分、敵艦果然亂開機槍、向南市我軍掃射、槍聲甚密、聲震浦江四周、每分鐘約百餘發、我軍沉着應戰、每於敵艦亂開一陣之後、始還擊三五響、並以小鋼砲對凖敵艦射擊、據附近目擊者談、敵艦曾中鋼砲彈、發岀響聲多次、並見火光迸裂、當時租界上空、並有敵機兩架、盤旋數匝即去、而雙方槍聲隨於十時半停止、此敵艦尚逗留不去、預料今後該艦或將再有蠢動、</p>
<p>中央社云、敵軍猛攻日暉港之綫未逞、昨午五時許、以砲艦駛至南市金利源碼頭、企圖衝破我封鎖綫、而由黃浦江沿岸之處來犯、我軍嚴密戒備、至七時、敵以淺水艇二艘、載水兵約五六十名、駛至封鎖綫旁、圖加破壞、經我軍用追擊砲及機關槍痛擊、敵亦還擊、遂起接觸、至八時許、戰况益趨激烈、惟敵計終未得逞、旋敵艦一艘悄然駛去、尚留一艦、與我相持中、</p>

<p>麥氏略歷</p>
<p>麥唐納(姓）哲姆斯萊姆塞（名）於一八六六年十月十五日生於蘇格蘭摩萊郡北面洛西茅斯鎮、幼時家徒壁立、幸賴祖母若母、訓育綦嚴、得以勉畢共學、厥後刻苦攻讀、孜孜不倦、卒得學養俱到焉、行年二十、麥唐納離鄕前往倫敦、一身之外、別無長物、不得不操作糊口、如是者一年有餘、每星期所得工資、自十五先令至一鎊不等、一部份又須寄往洛西茅斯鎭、以供贍家之需、其生活困苦、可以想見、在此期間、麥唐納對於工人生活、積極參加、其傾向社會主義、卽於是時開始、麥氏嗣卽	加入勞工運動、往往其席工人集會發表演說、雄辯消消、漸露頭角、當特勞工運動、抱有兩大目標、一卽减少工作時間、一卽增加工資、此在麥唐納则懷抱更較遠大、其見解與近代社會主義、實相暗合、一八九五年、麥氏首次在蘇桑普敦城參加下議員競選、結果竟告失敗、一九○○年、氏被推為工黨秘書、同年又在蘭塞斯脫城、參加競選、仍告落選、一九○六年、任獨立工黨黨魁、乃再度在蘭塞斯脫城競選、有志竟成、終於當選、氏任該城下議員者凡十二年、一九一一年、脫離獨立工黨、而任正統派工黨黨魁、一九一八年、競選失敗後、越四年、始在亞培拉奉城再度常選、翌年發生閣潮、麥氏應時代之需要、出而組閣、自任總揆、此乃英國歷史上第一次工黨內閣、惟麥氏一方而須獲取自由黨之支持、一方面對於工黨極左派之種種責難、尚隨時加以應付、以故任務至感困難、治至一九二四年、工黨競選挫敗、氏因以辭職、此際氏與工黨之關係、已益見緊張、甚至時有决裂之虞、著就內政而言、氏對於一九二六年所發生之運輸業工潮主張妥協、因此與支持工潮之總工會發生公開衝突、以言外交、黨方輒以麥氏未有充分勇氣、貫澈個人所信守之各項原則為之詬病、但麥氏旣已退居反對派地位、自可在下議院中、不時抨擊政府、此曾對於恢復過去令譽大有裨益、是以奮鬥五年之後、氏在黨中之地位、得以漸次恢復舊觀、終於一九二九年間、出而組織第二次工黨內閣、但經濟恐慌之狂潮、業已一發而不可遏止、一九三一年七月、內閣經濟委員會宣佈預算虧空之數、竟達一萬二千萬鎊之鉅、同時失業工人之增加、亦復有增無減、八月法蘭西銀行與美國聯邦凖備銀行、雖以二千五百萬鎊借予英格蘭銀行、但杯水車薪仍屬無濟於事、經濟委員會研究結果、認為唯一補救辦法、厥為實行緊縮政策、麥氏當卽表示贊成、至此工黨所屬各閣員、因反對减削工資辦法之故、認為碍難賡續合作、遂於八月二十一日聯袂辭職、閣潮因以發生、越後、先王喬治五世怱怱自巴爾廉拉行宮返京急召麥氏與保守黨黨魁包爾溫、自由黨黨魁薩繆爾三人、有所徵詢、翌日、麥氏卽奉命組成國民內閣、已故財相史諾登勛爵、旋於九月十日在下議院提出所謂非常時期之預算案、是月廿一日、英國政府並宣佈放棄金本位、十月十日、下議院舉行改選、結果保守黨獲得絕大多數、國民工黨所屬各閣員、得以常選連任者、僅麥氏與藍斯白雷二人而已、於是麥氏之工黨黨魁、大有名存實亡之概、迨至一九三五年十一月、氏被目疾所苦加以在下議院中、處處須仰保守黨之鼻息、乃以體力不勝為理由、而呈請辭職、保守黨黨魁包爾溫機之組閣、為保持國民內閣之性質起見、氏仍以國民工黨領袖之資格、担仕樞密大臣、一九三七年四月、世界糖業會議、在倫敦開會時、氏被推為主席、而於五月杪今王喬治六世加冕典禮舉行之後、與包爾溫同時引退以迄於今、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>戰略的傑作</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>滬西我軍是後撤了。金山衛一帶集中登敵人是竄擾到滬杭鐵路綫了。可是在持久戰的意義上。上海戰事郤可以說是相當成功的。</p>
<p>從開戰時候起。我軍事當局就感覺到上海是不能久守的。這一帶地方。因為受着停戰協定的限制。平時不能作國防的布置。單靠臨時構築的防禦工事。來抵抗暴敵海陸空軍全力的進攻。其困難是可想而知了。然而我們為了國家的光榮。為了政治上經濟上的關係。以及為了要消耗敵人的實力。决定固守上海以後。郤就在這不可守的地方。守上了三個月光景。而至今南市選在我軍的手里。這可不是值得我們自慰的麼。</p>
<p>而且我軍在作戰過程中。始終不曾中了敵人偷襲或是圍殲的毒計。消耗過大量的實力。每次撤退都非常的敏捷。非常的鎭靜。非常的有秩序。就是最近金山衛方面敵軍偸襲事件。也不能說全由於我軍的疏忽。因為事前那方面我軍主力的徹退正同滬西我軍的後撤一樣。顯然都出於我軍事當局早經預定的戰略。而這戰略的本質就在於集中主力跟敵人作持久戰。</p>
<p>外國的軍事觀察者。對於這次滬西方面我軍的撤退。又說是“戰略的傑作。”（見昨日英文大美晚報）這種盛譽。在我軍事當局實在是受之無愧的。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>團結第一</h3>
<p>— 胡愈之</p>
<p>南北戰塲這幾天軍事上起了一些新的變化•在上海近郊我們的軍隊，除一部分死守南市外，大部分已經開始向崑山松江嘉興這一條新防綫撤退•華北我軍也退出太原，而在山西全省擴大運動戰•就整個戰局來說，這一次軍事上的變化，不能算是失敗•因為上海我軍退出了敵人海軍的砲火綫，扼守防禦工事更堅强的第二道國防綫，就軍事効果上說，是絕對於我們有利的•至於太原的失陷，原已在意料中•而且以後敵軍愈加深入，愈難控制整個華北的戰局•就消耗敵軍力量的意義來說，是可以不必悲觀的。</p>
<p>即使退一百步說，我們已經過了一次失敗，這失敗也是當然的，早在我們預計中的•在對日長期抗戰中，我們必然要經過多次的失敗，不僅是一次二次，而且十次百次的失敗也是可能的•我們本來不想倚靠武力的優勢來戰勝敵人，而是倚靠我們民族抗戰的决心，來消滅敵人•所以我們的最後勝利，一定是由十次百次的失敗積累而成的•失敗並不可怕，可怕的就只是找們自己不堅决，我們內部不團結•但是團結郤比堅决更重要，因為假如內部不團結，是斷不能堅决抗戰到底的。</p>
<p>團結就是一切•假如我們內部不團結，是决不會有這一次抗戰的。九一八事變中，我們不能發動抗戰，是因為我們內部不團結•一二八戰爭半途而廢，也只因為我們還沒有團結•這次我們却能動員全國的力量，以與日寇一决勝負，這就因為我們内部已經團結起來了•就南北戰塲的形勢來說，上海方面我軍顯出異常的英勇，在軍事上創造了空前的勝利紀錄，這是因為在東戰塲，指揮絕對統一，軍隊與民衆，民衆與政府的團結，也比較地堅强•反之，華北戰事的幾次失利，大部分郤是由於指揮不統一團結不堅强的綠故。</p>
<p>團結禦侮這是一種老生常談•但正因為是老生常談，反容易被一般人所忽略•雖然在萬分緊急的時候，有些小心眼兒的人們，往往因一時個人的意氣，而把團結的意義忘記掉•過去一切的牙眼，照理應該完全拋棄，但是因為感染已深。有時竟會重行湧現到心頭•再加上敵人和漢奸，無時無地，不在放冷箭，施毒計，利用一切機會，破壞我們內部的團結，要是軍事上節節勝利的時候，還不要緊，在每遇軍事失利或形勢變換的時候，一般人就很容易動搖，所以在抗戰中間，敵人的飛機，大砲，毒瓦斯，不論如何可怕，却斷不比破壞團結的陰謀詭計更可怕•因為飛機，大砲，毒瓦斯只能摧毀我們一部分的陣地，而破壞團結的陰謀詭計，却可以取消我們的抗戰意志，而使我們陷於萬刦不復之境。</p>
<p>敵人破壞我們內部團結的陰謀詭計，有幾千幾百條，但是主要的不外兩種方法：對於我們的上層分子，用共產赤化這些話來挑撥離間，對於我們的民衆，煽惑他們和政府對立起來•這兩種方法，都是很拙笨的•稍微明白事理的人，旣不會相信抗戰的結果要造成赤化，更不會主張在國難嚴重的時候，和政府對立•但是一切頭腦幼稚的，小心眼兒的，把個人利益看得高過於一切的，就往往會因這種挑撥離間而動搖起來•對於抗戰的前途，旣然動搖，於是就會有意無意地表露出中途妥洽的主張•一個人不要聚，兩個人不要緊，有幾百個幾千個人主張中途妥洽，敵人的挑撥離間，陰謀詭計，就達到目的了。</p>
<p>蔣委員長明白地指示我們：“我們已在抗戰開始時，誰明民族團結，國家統一的力量的偉大，我們更要在抗戰中間，表現我們的統一，加强我們的團結。”假如抗戰在勝利的過程中繼續進展中的今日，還有人誤信抗戰要造成赤化，而因此踟蹰不前，還有人反對政府當局，而因此消極怠工，那就等於執行了敵人命令，以破壞我們的團結。為了民族國家的前途，非根本剷除此種亡國心理不可。</p>
<p>我們不怕失敗，找們不怕困難。我們要準備好應付一切的失敗與困難，而其中不能有一刻忘記的是團結第一”。</p>

<p>茶商之子反對戰爭自殺　物價騰貴市塲異常蕭條</p>

<p>船經三池埠•神戶•大阪•名古屋•橫濱•等埠、在八一三之前、外輪華員、均可自由登岸、但此次則完全不凖登陸、且戒備森嚴、不能稍越雷池一步、一入晚上、因畏我空軍或往夜襲、水陸各處、一律熄滅燈火、呈露非常恐怖狀態、致使繁盛商埠、頓成黑暗世界、</p>
<p>日常局扣留其自國商輪、達數百艘以上、用作運兵輸糧之用、各埠運兵、異常怱忙、每日開出運輸船隻、在二三十艘之間、每船傍岸、僅停留三四小時、卽又滿載開駛、情形極度緊張、</p>

<p>日本乃一新興工業國、全恃國外貿易為養命之源、在戰事發生後、對外貿易、一落千丈、經濟陷於極度枯困、金融基本動搖、禁止對外匯兌、原料輸入停止、工廠幾全部停頓、工人不受徵兵之痛苦者、亦受失業之煩惱、對當局之窮兵黷武、啣之刺骨、怨恨之情、溢於言表、</p>

<p>十日有自滬西漕河涇鎭逃出者談、前（九日）日上午敵機十餘架、至鎭轟炸、毀損房屋甚多、萬壽庵隔壁公安局房屋中一彈、金榮橋亦被炸斷、迨至下午、該鎮與龍華同時發現敵軍、卽被焚燒殘殺、港南楊家港楊小毛住宅、着火燃燒、鎮上店戶門窗、悉已洞開、內部損失不貲、附近鄕民、因不及逃避、慘被殺戮者、約十餘人、內有張金香與張秋林之妻、均被槍殺、棄屍途中、該鎮楊宅、已駐敵軍部、所幸居民走避、敵雖佔據、實毫無得益云、</p>

<h3>本市米糧絕對無虞</h3>
<p>存米七十萬擔且陸續向外採購　米號業公會取締乘機抬高米價</p>
<p>因我國軍移向新陣綫、租界向外交通路事阻礙、致本市米糧、昨又暗漲甚烈、有數家米店、竟閉門不開、人心不免影響、華東社記者昨午晤本市食糧業領袖顧氏、渠囑記者轉吿市民、切勿驚恐、現在存食米、尚有七十萬擔、况食糧團體已紛紛向內地選運、記者親睹內地米商多人、謂有三十萬擔新粳、集中待運、不日可到滬云、並悉公共租界及法租界當局、對於中外市民食米問題、亦極關懷、正計劃從香港•西貢·暹邏等地採購、至昨日紊亂情形、乃少數米商暗中抬價、實則米糧存額、仍極充足、</p>

<h3>抗戰以來的文化街頭（上）</h3>
<p>— 槐靑</p>
<p>自八一三戰事爆發後，上海的出版界，正和整個的市面一樣，全都陷於停止狀態中。直接間接所受到的損失，都非常的重大。後來人心逐漸穏定，市面漸見恢復，文化街上除了二種點綴在沉寂的街頭的抗戰刊物外，也慢慢的振作起來了。可是除了應運而生的抗戰畫報雜誌和各式各種的小册子外，以整個的出版界而論，自然都只是勉力支持，以應付這非常時期！現在姑就管見所及，把抗戰以來文化街上的情形，概述如下。</p>
<p>㊀書局動態</p>
<p>全國出版界“托辣斯”的商務印書館，當一二八的時候，損失最大，寶山路的印刷總廠和東方圖書館，全部燬滅於砲火中•因是停業半年•復業後，實施科學管理，銳意革新，業務乃逐漸繁榮，去年一年，營業尤爲會逹，顯然已超過戰前狀況、卽以今年一月至八月十四而論，除出版大量的教科書和大部叢書之外，單以日出新書一項而論，已逹七百四十五種，計一千零九册•去年全年亦祇八百餘種。</p>
<p>商務書館自第一次砲火所得的經驗，和戰後所生的勞資糾紛所得的教訓，使他們在行政組織上，格外的縝密了，除在香港設立總廠外，上海方面的工塲，也分散設立，所以這次戰事的發生，上海直接所受的損失，若與一二八比較一下，眞是微乎其微。八月下半月及整個的九月，雖然停止出書，可是十月份起，就繼續印行新書和各種雜誌，不過質量稍微緊縮了一些。</p>
<p>本年宣布的每週特價書，現仍繼續發售，但折扣已由七折改爲八折、星期標準書則已停止•每日新書自十月一日起，暫定日出一種。雜誌方面十月份恢復者爲東方雜誌，敎育雜誌，兒童世界，和英語週刊四種，不過以紙張和人力關係，暫時規定以兩期一次合刊。並悉少年畫報和兒童畫報也將於本月內復刊。</p>
<p>新近出版，以承繼小說月報的文學雜誌，是一個大型的交藝刊物：它具有一付新鮮的面目，抱持着一種獨特的主張•門類繁多，製作嚴謹；與時下流行的一些文藝刊物，逈乎不同•是值得呌人凝眸注視的一個奇蹟！可惜只出到四期，便給殘酷　砲火，一陣子連其他的雜誌都一命嗚呼了！</p>
<p>中華書局，他們很早的出版了一部“非常時期報書，”在戰事發生後，很受讀者的歡迎，門市部還相當的熱鬧。可是三個月來沒見他們出過一册新書•卽如發行的七種雜誌，也直到本月初頭才見到復刊的消息；而復刊者還只是少年周報，小朋友週刊，和中華英文周報三種。且還是兩期合併一期出版的。</p>
<p>聽說不久以前，中畢書局有大批書籍•載運外埠，分裝民船五艘，不幸在中途遭遇到敵機的轟炸，全部損毀•這眞是一件很痛心的事！</p>
<p>開明與世界兩書局，整個的印刷工塲，部陷於敵人的戰區里，損失都很重大。開明書店的“中學生”和“新少年”等雜誌，至今不能復刊，即與“文摘”分庭抗禮而最受讀者歡迎的月報”，也只得暫時停刊了</p>
<p>當各書局正在紛亂的局面下，部署整頓的時候，生活書店却乘此機會，大大的活躍起來，很快底在霞飛路康健書局內分設門市部，十幾種世界知識業書，都是把握着當前時代的作品，生意着實不差。</p>
<p>㊁街頭書攤</p>
<p>以畫報起家，轉爲專刊文學作品的良友圖書公司，發行部和棧房等等，都在北四川路，陷於敵人砲火中，雖曾搬出一些，大部份都犧牲了•嗣後又被小偷冒險潛入書棧，竊取大批的書籍，賤價貶賣，有一時期各處馬路上，儘是些書攤子，而書攤上又儘是花花綠綠簇新的良友文學叢書和良友文庫等•一般文學靑年如獲買藏，無不爭相購買，到處搜求，法幣一二元，可以滿載血歸•書販亦利市三倍•顧客賣主，兩得其便，而良友公司却暗暗吃苦不小•</p>
<p>這些書攤的大本營有兩處，一在愛文義路卡德路口，一在霞飛路呂班路一帶•最初的一星期內，各書不論新舊與價值，一律售兩折•後來知道的人多了，生意突然興盛起來，售價也隨之增至二折半至三折。且有時竟不論書的定價多少，而以書的厚薄論值，如文學業書照原定價是不論厚薄一律每本九角，書攤上最初一律售每本兩角，後增至二角半，最後並有售至三角者。而比較厚些的如氷瑩的”一個女兵的自傳”，張天翼的長篇“年”等等，價值往往更要提高些。</p>
<p>有幾家小書店內，也曾有發現這些後門貨”，可是售價要對折，塌便宜貨的朋友是决不會上當的。</p>
<p>全部書籍以文學叢書和中國新文學大系的銷路最好。而中國新文學大系里的兩册散文集，更爲讀者所歡迎。每本取值三角，很快的就被爭購一空。其次是新文學大系三部小說集，銷路也相當的好。建設理論集，文學論爭集，史料與索引，詩，戯劇集等，顧客就比較的少了•可見羣衆的文學趣味，胃口都是相同的。</p>
<p>現在書攤已經漸漸减少了，良友的書籍，大去都已安置在每個讀者的案頭了•我有一次和書攤上的伙計閒談，問他這些書怎麽偷出來的•他說是由“　三”喬裝小販，挑着籮担，上面舖着水菓或花生米等，裹面便裝滿着書，就這樣一次次逐漸偷出來的•最初偷的人不知這些書的價值，稱着斤量當作舊貨賣的，後來知道這些書很有銷路，於是論本數或照定價一折發售。我想　一和小偷决不會搬出這許多書，這里面或者有其他原因的，但總之這是一件冒險的勾當。</p>
<p>書攤上的良友文學書的風頭，已經過去，以前泰東書局出版的許多社會主義的“禁書”，乃又充塞於途•這些書的紙張都已陳舊不堪，可是售價却並不便宜，如陶伯（即已槍斃的彭怵之）所譯布哈林著的“唯物史觀”和“馬克思傳”，每部原定價三元，現在仍得要賣六折或對折•這也是時勢所趋•這些書顯然也有很好的銷路•（未完）</p>

<p>飛機大砲猛烈轟炸我沉着應戰　小部敵軍強渡過橋被我堵擊中　敵強佔英商鬨平碼頭被我包圍</p>
<p>（本報特訊）日暉港東西兩岸、以迄黃浦江邊、我敵兩軍、仍在隔水對峙中、昨日下午四時左右、在楓林橋南之敵軍、開始以野戰砲向南市方而轟擊、同時敵機亦臨沿浦上空、循環投擲巨量炸彈、兼為敵砲兵指示目標、惟以敵方登砲至稀、故我守軍未予理會、但敵軍見我沉着不動、卽在暮色苍茫之際、圍向西岸偷渡、當時我軍立以機槍掃射、敵知有備、急遽竄田、於是東西兩岸、一度引起密集之射擊、約一小時後、卽逐漸疏落、而遠沉靜、入晚後、雙方未有動作、惟敵軍偶在相隔久之後、發出一二砲、於我毫無損傷、直至今晨四時許、敵軍又圖活動、槍砲聲重起、且逐漸轉密、敵機亦於斯時出動、往返投彈、我軍遂立卽還砲、奮起出擊、日暉港間頓時入於緊張狀態、</p>
<h3>徐家匯路情形緊張</h3>
<p>至今晨六時、砲聲始終斷續不絕、並雜有應疏之米槍聲、至九時許、本報記者趨車赴法租界西區與華界接壤處視察、汝林路高恩路一帶、已接近敵軍後方、砲聲隆𨺓震耳、時有敵巨型轟炸機四五架、飛越法租界、附近之某處法軍、曾開高射砲多響、加以警告、該敵機飛至日暉港東區我軍陣地、投擲巨彈多枚、炸聲甚巨、着弹處立卽起火、黑煙直冒、在福理履路淸晰可見、徐家匯路因緊急火綫區域、已斷絕交通、而與徐家匯路啣接之各橫路、如通楓林橋之祁齊路、及通打浦橋之金神父路等、在距徐家匯路約二百米達之處、巳阻止通行、而打浦橋南面、正為兩軍激戰之交叉點、蓋南首華界、卽為日暉港、時砲火異常猛烈、黑煙迷溫、附近房屋、均被震動、而接近打浦橋之金神父路南首一帶居民、均紛紛遷避、甚形恐慌、而徐家匯路一帶、流彈甚多、</p>

<h3>開平碼頭我軍擊敵</h3>
<p>中央社云、南市日暉港西、英商所經營之開平煤礦碼碩、我在該處並未設有防禦工事、乃敵竟不顧國際信義、於今晨一時、由敵軍八十餘人、將該碼頭強行佔據、我為自衛計、遂起而出擊、當時擊傷敵十餘人、餘敵逃入碼頭大樓中、我軍受傷者四五人、</p>

<h3>〔瑣評〕</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>九國公約會議。余早料其絕無效果。惟一般迷信「會議神聖論」者。猶以為至少必有一些用處。而今果如何矣。該會開會之先。曾歡迎蘇聯之參加。蘇聯既參加矣。又惟恐其不去。使被擅於調解委員會之外。宜李維諾夫之拂袖而去也。觀李維諾夫之何為而來。與李維諾夫之何所為而去。則九國公約會議之結果。其劣點已𥁞情表現矣。尚何望之有。</p>

<h3>培成我們有力的抗戰隊伍</h3>
<p>— 張鳴時</p>
<p>大概在一星期以前吧？接到郭我力先生的來函，他指示了們很多的高見，我們除了竭誠欽佩接納之外，有不得已於言者兩點㊀把我們所處環境作一個簡單的報告。㊁在可能範圍以內作一個對外的徵求，以實現我們的理想。可是說也慚愧，連日來編者，為了整理“上海童子軍”月刋稿件和“戰時童軍”稿件，加着被個人生活間題的工作所驅使，把我那藐小身手，陷落在繁忙的氛圍中，因此一遲再遲直到今天。現在不能再遲了，所以在此繁忙中抽出一些時間，完了此素願。</p>
<p>郭先生提出本欄的篇幅问題，他的意思是“願盡綿簿以贊助戰時靑年這一園地，不過，希望能夠將篇幅擴大些更好！”關於這一點就得向郭先生以及其他和郭先生具有同樣意思的“戰時靑年”愛護者大略報告一些。</p>
<p>當我們開始向各方接洽“戰時靑年出版問題的時候，差不多得到一個相同的答覆，就是：“在此抗戰期中，報紙的來源不暢，幾乎全靠存貨支持。因此不得不縮减篇幅，以謀持久。在此種現狀下，一遇新聞擁擠，往往把廣告也抽去，可見地位之侷促，已經到極點了。雖然協助抗戰宣傳是報紙應盡的義務，可是心餘力絀，不得不徒喚奈何了！”我們聽到了這般言論之後，雖與有為國効力之心，但是也不能强人所難，何况這種答復實在是人家不得意的苦衷，當然不好再去商量。</p>
<p>最後，經過多方的設法，纔蒙申報館概許按日酌給一二千字地位，以供本欄發表之用，不過遇到稿件擁擠時，還得酌量縮小。在幾度商討之後，就從十月一日起開始刋佈。那知事情又起變化了，就是申報方面感覺到篇幅不敷，事實上不能天天刋載，如果一定要天天刋載，那麼只有改入夕刋中，比較容易辦到。因此，從二日起，就改入申報夕刋中發表。</p>
<p>當然，我們也很想把篇幅擴充些，使我們可以把內容充實些，同時宣傳的力量也加强一些，對於抗戰前途，不無小補。可是從接洽發表的經過中來觀察，也許是一個很困難的問題吧？不過我們當然還得想商量報館方面，再予我們一些帮助，俾滿足我們和愛護者的希望，我想除非是實在沒有在辦法，否則，報館一定願意贊助的！</p>
<p>郭先生還提出了本欄內容方面的問題，他的意思是；“盡量搜集關於靑年所需要的材料，俾培成我們這一支有力的抗戰急進隊伍。”關於這一點須從兩方面來討論，第一是“需要問題”，什麼是靑年的需要？我們當然不能以主觀的目的光去武斷的，並且各人實際的需要是未必一致的，所以最好的方法，惟有向外徵求，請求靑年界把各人自身所需要的，告訴我們，我們接到了這種報告之後，就可分類整理，照着需要的緩急，分別先後，把那些需要的材料逐漸介紹。否則，我們所介紹的許多材料，也許並非多數靑年所需要的；另一方面，靑年們急切需要的材料，也許我們反而沒有介紹出來，這樣不是太不經濟嗎？第二是“人材問題”，我們這一個團體，所負的使命着實廣大，所任工作着實繁重，像後方傷兵醫院的擔任警衛抬架急救看護慰勞徵募等工作，難民收容所的擔任警衛糾察收容遣送徵衣等工作，在前方則擔任救護運輸交通情報文書聯絡等工作，其他還有各種救亡團體臨時集會的秋序維持等等，隨在需要我們團員職員的參加，因此，我們差不多把整個的力量傾向到這上面。所有宣傳方面的人材，當然不能如何的充實，尤其是編輯方面祇有一二人負責，而所經營的事業，却有“上海童子軍”月刋，“戰時童軍”及“戰時靑年”三種定期刋物，還有“戰時壁書”不定期讀物及應酬各出版界的徵稿，你想窮一二人的力量來應付這樣繁劇，如何不感力量的單薄，何况還有為維持個人生活而產生的職業工作，不能不分一部力量去辦理，這樣豈不是忙上加忙了嗎？如果我們退一步說，卽使不感到忙碌，試問以一二人的才智，是否能滿足靑年界的需要呢？為了以上種種迫切的需要，不得不向各界求協助。</p>
<p>現在我想除了內部工作人員外，還得徵求外界長期義務特約選述，按期供給一些作品，遇到特殊的問題，指定幾位商討解决，這樣，靑年界所需要的材料，不難逐漸供給。質諸郭先生，不知以為何如？</p>
<p>最後，我希望郭先生把尊址告訴我，以便走訪或通信，同時，希望贊同我們上面兩項辦法的，直接來信示知，以利進行！</p>

<h3>Enemy Troops Launched a General Attack on Nanshi Yesterday, Our Loyal and Brave Soldiers Responded with Blood</h3>
<p>Over Twenty Enemy Planes Took Turns Bombing, Utterly Inhuman - Repeated Fierce Attacks on Rihui Port Were All Repelled by Our Troops - The Enemy Suffered Extremely Heavy Losses in the Rice Market Ferry and Huacao Areas</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch reports that the enemy troops launched a general attack on Nanshi starting at 1 PM yesterday. More than 20 bombing planes flew low over the concession, taking turns dropping bombs on Nanshi. A reporter witnessed that, in just fifteen minutes from 2:15 PM to 2:30 PM, as many as forty or fifty bombs were dropped. At the same time, enemy warships also relentlessly bombarded the area with heavy artillery. For a time, black smoke filled the sky, and the sound shook the buildings. The tragic situation was unprecedented since the start of the Shanghai battle. Many residents of the concession went to the tops of high-rise buildings to watch the battle. Seeing these executioners of humanity carrying out their slaughter, everyone was filled with righteous indignation and grief. The loyal and brave soldiers of the 55th Division's Brigade, who were ordered to defend the area to the death, and the city's police force, under the command of Cai Jingjun, fought bravely and tenaciously, their morale was particularly inspiring and tear-jerking. The troops ordered to defend Nanshi began to make frontal contact with the enemy yesterday morning. Although the enemy relied on its powerful naval, land, and air weapons to launch fierce attacks, our positions remained unshaken. At around 6 AM yesterday morning, the enemy first used a small detachment, equipped with small tanks, and launched a three-pronged attack along Longhua Road, Xieshi Road, and Xuxu Road. When they approached the shore of Rihui Port, they were immediately swept by our machine gun fire, and several enemy soldiers fell in response. Although their tanks charged back and forth, they were unable to cross because the bridges at all intersections had been destroyed. After a stalemate of about an hour, the enemy retreated west of Damu Bridge. At about 10 AM, more than 200 enemy soldiers, accompanied by two mortars, advanced eastward along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, but were also met with a head-on attack by our defending troops, who repelled them. The enemy launched several more attacks in the afternoon, but all failed.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Fiercely Attack Rihui Port</h3>
<p>We Rely on Solid Fortifications to Fight Back - Although the Enemy Was Stubborn, They Ultimately Failed</p>
<p>Enemy Fiercely Attacks Rihui Port Without Success</p>
<p>According to military intelligence, an enemy regiment, under the cover of six tanks, advanced eastward along Xieshi Road towards our Rihui Port line at 6 AM yesterday. Our troops relied on solid fortifications and calmly responded to the battle. Seeing the enemy approaching the coast, they immediately swept them with machine gun fire. Many enemy soldiers fell in response. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy fought stubbornly for about two hours, but ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 10th) at 6 AM, two enemy tanks, covering more than a hundred enemy soldiers, and another two enemy tanks, covering fifty or sixty enemy soldiers, attacked Pingyin Bridge, Kangqu Bridge, and other places. Our ××× troops, who were ordered to defend Nanshi, met them with a head-on attack. After a stalemate of more than an hour, the enemy retreated knowing the difficulty.</p>
<p>Enemy Assembles in the Xujiahui Area</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch reports that the enemy troops attacking Nanshi are currently assembling in the Xujiahui area, and a large amount of military equipment, both light and heavy, has been transported there. They started building fortifications at Damu Bridge and Fenglin Bridge last night. Yesterday morning (the 10th), they sent hundreds of enemy soldiers to patrol and loot in various places. At the same time, many enemy planes, in groups of three or five, flew over the entire Nanshi and the neighboring French Concession, circling for a long time, but did not drop bombs.</p>
<h3>Enemy Lands at Kaiping Wharf</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch reports that the Kaiping Coal Mine Wharf (west of Rihui Port in Nanshi) is operated by a British merchant. Our troops did not set up defensive fortifications there, but the enemy, disregarding international trust and righteousness, actually landed there and built fortifications near a certain American-owned house flying the American flag, attempting to use the special terrain to launch an attack.</p>
<h3>Enemy at Rice Market Ferry Heavily Besieged and Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>We Killed More Than a Hundred Enemies East of Huacao Town</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch reports that our new front line, south of Nanxiang, is between the Suzhou River and the Huangpu River, holding several key points in Huangdu, Qingpu, and Songjiang. The positions are consolidated and the defense is tight. However, our troops are currently still in contact with the enemy in front of the main positions. Up to the line from Nanxiang to the north to Liuhe, our positions have not changed.</p>
<p>We Surround the Remaining Enemy at the Rice Market Ferry</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 1 PM on the 10th that at around 3 AM this morning, our fresh troops had surrounded and annihilated the remaining enemy at the Rice Market Ferry and Jinjibin areas south of Songjiang Railway Station. The enemy was trapped in the encirclement, and although they desperately charged, they ultimately failed to break through. By 7:30 AM this morning, the enemy's casualties had reached 400.</p>
<p>More Than a Hundred Enemies Annihilated East of Huacao Town</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 1 PM on the 10th that our troops on the south bank of the Suzhou River near Zhujiabang were ordered to withdraw westward, and yesterday morning, they had set up new positions near Huacao Town. However, our covering troops were still in the Hejiashang Chenxiang area, about 600 meters east of the town. The enemy's advance units, about 300 men, advanced westward along the Bias Road at 9:30 PM last night and encountered our troops, resulting in contact. Our troops immediately adopted an encirclement formation and annihilated more than a hundred enemy soldiers. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the enemy retreated under the cover of tanks.</p>
<h3>Enemy Shallow-Draft Gunboats Attacked Our Nanshi Last Night</h3>
<p>Sailed Close to the Blockade Line, Attempting to Attack Nanshi - Launched a Fierce Attack at Around 9 PM Last Night</p>
<p>After our Nanshi military and police forces were ordered by the highest authorities to defend the Nanshi area, the enemy became quite anxious. Therefore, starting at 2:40 PM yesterday, in addition to sending a large number of planes to bomb the area, attempting to destroy it, a shallow-draft gunboat of the enemy army, which was parked on the river surface of the Gonghexiang Wharf, sailed past the defense zones of the British, American, and French fleets, and parked on the river surface of the Jinliyuan Wharf in Shiliupu, only a hundred meters away from our blockade line, with the intention of bombing Nanshi from the Huangpu River. At that time, residents in the area were panicked when they saw the enemy warship suddenly arriving,</p>
<p>and moved away in droves. The fish markets in the Shiliupu area also closed early. At the same time, after learning about the situation, the French Concession authorities specially dispatched military and police to the Shiliupu area to be stationed there to strengthen the defense. As for our Nanshi military and police forces, they had long understood the enemy's intentions, so they had already strengthened their defenses at various strongholds. If the enemy advanced, they would launch a head-on attack. At 9:20 PM, the enemy warship indeed opened fire with machine guns, spraying our troops in Nanshi. The gunfire was very dense, shaking the surroundings of the Huangpu River, with about a hundred rounds per minute. Our troops calmly responded to the battle, only returning fire three or five times after the enemy warship fired a burst, and using small cannons to aim at the enemy warship. According to nearby witnesses, the enemy warship was hit by cannon shells, making several loud noises, and sparks were seen flying. At that time, there were also two enemy planes circling in the sky over the concession before leaving. The gunshots stopped at 10:30 PM, but the enemy warship remained, and it is expected that the warship will make further moves in the future.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch reports that the enemy's fierce attack on the Rihui Port line was unsuccessful. At around 5 PM yesterday, they used gunboats to sail to the Jinliyuan Wharf in Nanshi, attempting to break through our blockade line and attack from the Huangpu River. Our troops were on high alert. At 7 PM, the enemy used two shallow-water boats, carrying about fifty or sixty sailors, and sailed to the blockade line, attempting to sabotage it. Our troops retaliated with howitzer cannons and machine guns, and the enemy also retaliated, resulting in contact. By 8 PM, the battle became increasingly fierce, but the enemy's plan ultimately failed. Then, an enemy warship quietly sailed away, leaving one warship behind, and remaining in a stalemate with us.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Flew to Hangzhou Bay in Several Squadrons to Bomb Enemy Warships</h3>
<p>One Ship Was Hit and Caught Fire</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 9th: The enemy who had infiltrated Zhejiang Province, after being surrounded and suppressed by our troops on three sides, was already unable to hold out on the 9th, and fled back to the enemy warships. However, the enemy who had been surrounded by us along the coast was still stubbornly resisting, and it is expected that they can be cleared up in the near future. Also, our air force flew to Hangzhou Bay several times in the morning of the 9th to bomb enemy warships. One ship was hit and caught fire. Our planes safely returned after completing their mission.</p>
<h3>The City Defense Corps Assists the Military and Police in Combat</h3>
<p>Expressing the Spirit of Our Great Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, the City Defense Corps of this city, by the order of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, concentrated and reorganized the officers and members of the defense corps in the city's seventeen districts into two regiments. The first regiment consisted of the ten districts south of the Suzhou River, including Pusong, Fahua, Caojing, Hunan, and the Pudong areas of Gaoqiao, Gaohang, Lihang, Yangjing, Tangqiao, and Yangsi. The second regiment consisted of the seven districts north of the Suzhou River, including Zhenru, Pengpu, Huhua, Yinxiang, Jiangwan, and Wusong. At that time, the first regiment was ordered to be under the command of Director Cai Jingjun of the Police Bureau to assist the police in defense. The second regiment was under the command of Chief Director Ji Zhangjian of the Security Corps to assist the troops in combat. Since the start of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, they have participated in combat in the Zhabei Qingyun Bridge area, and have also taken on the roles of guides, paramedics, and stretcher-bearers. They have made great contributions to maintaining local security and preventing traitors. Later, they were ordered to construct solid fortifications in the Nanxiang, West Shanghai, and South Shanghai areas, which are now the fortifications in the combat areas, and received commendation from Commander-in-Chief. Later, on October 5th, they were ordered to place the defense corps in the Pudong districts under the command of the ×× Division. On October 12th, the first regiment of the defense corps in South Shanghai was placed under the command of Director Cai Jingjun of the City Police Bureau, and the second regiment was placed under the command of the ×× Brigade of the ×× Division. On October 26th, the second regiment was ordered to move to the area west of Rihui Port and east of Tianyao Bridge for alert duties, under the command of Commander Yang. On the 9th of this month, the enemy troops broke through Bridge No. 1 on Zhongshan Road and outflanked South Shanghai from Longhua. Because the second regiment of the defense corps only had rifles and no other weapons, and the ammunition had been used up during combat, and they had not been able to replenish it due to being engaged in constructing fortifications, they were unable to firmly resist and retreated towards Nanshi. By 2 PM, after the main force had passed through Rihui Port, enemy soldiers had advanced from Fenglin Bridge and Xietu Road towards Rihui Port. Their forward scouts, numbering eight, charged forward while randomly firing with submachine guns. When they reached the Xiaomu Bridge intersection, Xu Keqiang, the team leader of the first squad of the first platoon of the second regiment of our defense corps, led a class of members and ambushed at the Damu Bridge intersection, providing rear guard cover. Seeing the enemy soldiers approaching, he gave a command, and box cannons showered the enemy soldiers like rain. Two enemy soldiers were seen falling to the ground after being hit. The remaining soldiers fled backward. Seeing that the mission had been accomplished, Team Leader Xu safely retreated past Rihui Port. Soon after, seven enemy armored vehicles arrived. When they approached Rihui Port, they were hit by landmines and also retreated. Currently, in addition to a part of the City Defense Corps that is still maintaining security in Pudong, the Nanshi troops of the first regiment, led by Regiment Commander Yu Zhaopeng, Regiment Adjutants Wang Zhuangfei and Lu Yongqi, and Battalion Commanders Zhu Shengyang, Feng Runsheng, and Fang Weiren, are assisting the military and police in holding Nanshi to the death, making a final stand to show the spirit of our Great Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Isolated Troops in Nanshi Shot Down Two Enemy Planes</h3>
<p>Over a thousand enemy planes flew to Nanshi to bomb in teams of two or three from 1 PM to 5 PM yesterday, dropping dozens of bombs and destroying many civilian houses. However, our defensive fortifications were not damaged. When the enemy planes ran rampant, our troops used anti-aircraft guns to bombard them and hit two of them, which crashed near the South Railway Station. The planes were destroyed and the people were killed. The isolated troops who are holding Nanshi in difficult circumstances demonstrated such an amazing power, and their heroic conduct is admirable.</p>
<h3>The Administrative Power of the Public Concession Will Never Be Changed</h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Absolutely Must Not Interfere</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" of this city reports that a certain senior official of the Municipal Council told a reporter of the "Continental Daily News" on the 9th that the Shanghai battle situation had suddenly changed. However, the Municipal Council will still follow its original aim, making the Public Concession a place where Chinese and foreign people can live in peace. Chinese newspapers and public organizations, as long as their actions do not conflict with the law and order, can still maintain their original status. As for the administrative power of the Public Concession, even when the Japanese army occupies areas outside the Public Concession and the French Concession, it will still be held by the elected directors, and the Japanese side will not interfere. The senior official then denied the rumor that the Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the increased influence of Japan on the north bank of the Suzhou River, was planning to increase the number of Japanese personnel, saying that the Municipal Council had never discussed this issue since the start of the Shanghai Battle, and that the rumor was purely a fabrication. Also, the issue of restoring police power over the extra-territorial roads is being closely watched. It seems that the police power there will not be restored immediately before the situation in West Shanghai is clarified.</p>
<h3>A Young Englishman Bravely Does Good Deeds and Rescues Refugees in Hongqiao Village</h3>
<p>Although in an Extremely Critical Situation, He Remained Very Calm - Finally Overcame Difficulties and Saved a Family of Seven</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that a certain young British architect, accompanied by a Chinese carpenter, went to Hongqiao Village at 10:45 AM on Tuesday, passing through the French soldiers' defense line in Xujiahui, to check on his damaged property. On the way, he went through many dangers and was stopped by Japanese soldiers, who wanted to drag the carpenter down. Fortunately, the young man protected him and was able to pass through. When he arrived at his destination, he saw that the building was not damaged, but there was a Chinese family of seven, old and young, who were taking refuge inside, terrified. The young man was immediately filled with compassion and told them to get into the car, and stuffed the things they had brought into the car, and carried them to Shanghai. The gratitude of the people is self-evident. At first, they encountered twenty Japanese soldiers. After the young man negotiated with them, they were fortunately released. Later, they were blocked by Japanese soldiers again, who opened the car door and wanted to drag the refugees down. The young man told them that they were all non-combatants and were servants of the house, and said that he was an Englishman, and showed his passport. The Japanese soldiers seemed even more angry when they heard this. One of them, who was tall, in addition to carrying a rifle and a pistol, also held a stick, stepped forward and took the passport from the young man's hand, and pointed a pistol at him. The young man saw a wounded Chinese person nearby, and saw a Japanese soldier holding a gun on his shoulder in the corner of his eye. Then he heard the sound of a bullet being fired, because he was killing someone again. The young man's hair stood on end at this time, but although he was in imminent danger, he did not give in. He tried his best to prevent the Japanese soldiers from dragging the people down, so as to avoid a tragic death. So, on the one hand, he ordered the people in the car to sit still and not move, and on the other hand, he argued loudly, pretending to be imposing, in order to prevent the Japanese soldiers from acting recklessly immediately. Earlier, a Japanese soldier was repairing an abandoned truck of the Chinese army on the road, and was struggling to find a way. The young man stopped and watched, and immediately discovered the location of the damage. The Japanese soldier was quite angry with him. At the critical moment, the Japanese soldier suddenly drove the truck to the scene. The young man hurriedly greeted him as if he were an old friend, so the Japanese soldier interceded for him and summoned an interpreter to inquire about everything. The young man was able to escape the siege and safely carry the people to Shanghai. Along the way, he saw the corpses of men and women and farmers, still bleeding. Although this trip was only two hours long, the shock was not small.</p>
<h3>Defending Nanshi Has Supreme Significance</h3>
<p>Commander Yang Gave a Speech Yesterday</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Yang Hu, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, gave an important speech to reporters yesterday in the midst of his busy military affairs, as follows: The Nanshi area is the foundation of Shanghai. Defending Nanshi means defending Shanghai. If Nanshi is not lost for a day, then Shanghai is not lost for a day. Therefore, our military and police forces are determined to defend it to the death, aiming to achieve the purpose of solid defense. Understanding this, one will know that the Nanshi resistance has supreme significance. Secondly, some people may say that the small area of Nanshi is ultimately indefensible. However, it is not known that in the Zhabei Sihang Warehouse, a tiny piece of land, our troops defended it to the death, and the enemy had no way to deal with us. Moreover, the Nanshi positions and food have been fully prepared for a long time. This small area is conducive to holding out in resistance, and our troops guarding this area have the determination to die. We believe that the results of the Nanshi resistance will definitely gain a supreme price. As for our responsibility to defend our territory, it is a matter of course, and there is no need to say more.</p>
<h3>Nanshi and Pudong Suffered Tragic Bombing All Day Long</h3>
<p>Many Houses Were Destroyed - Many Civilians Were Killed and Injured Nanshi</p>
<p>Nanshi Central News Agency reported that yesterday afternoon, starting at 2 PM, more than a dozen enemy planes ran rampant and bombed Nanshi. At the same time, the enemy artillery positions also fired fiercely, bombarding our Nanshi. The destroyed areas that have been investigated and confirmed include the Dongtingshan Street, Damatou Street, Laozidou Street, Doushi Street, and Zhangjia Alley in Shiliupu, all of which were bombed by enemy planes, killing one person and seriously injuring two. The Chao-Hui Guild Hall was bombed and destroyed. The Wangjia Wharf Catholic Church and the Fire Brigade were also bombed. No. 12 of Hesun Lane in Wangjia Wharf was bombed and destroyed. No. 24 of Meijia Lane was completely destroyed. Two houses at No. 25 and 27 of Menghua Street were destroyed. A civilian house in Menghualou Yingshengfang was destroyed by a bomb.

The Taosha Field was hit by enemy artillery shells, and the nearby houses were destroyed and caught fire, burning fiercely. The Nanshi Jianghai Sub-Customs was also destroyed by enemy shells. A bomb hit the Mingde Girls' School in Nancang Street, Dongjiadu, killing one girl. In addition, the Wenmiao Road and Menghua Street areas were hit by dozens of enemy artillery shells. All of the above-mentioned places are civilian houses with no stationed troops, and the enemy planes are indiscriminately bombing them. At the same time, Pudong was also running rampant and bombing, which is truly inhuman. Yesterday (the 10th), starting at dawn, enemy planes flew over Nanshi and Pudong, with as few as two or three planes at a time, and as many as five or six planes at a time, taking turns flying back and forth, circling and scouting. At about 10 AM, three enemy planes rampaged along the Waitan area on the Bund, shooting downwards with machine guns from time to time. At that time, there were two rice boats parked next to the Santai Wharf, and three boatmen were killed by machine gun bullets, and more than ten boatmen were injured. It is not known whether there were any deaths or injuries among passersby. At about 11 AM, another eight enemy heavy bombers flew to Gaochang Temple and other places and dropped bombs. At about 1 PM, eight enemy planes flew to the Rihui Port area and dropped bombs. More than a dozen planes circled over the Bund along the Huangpu River in Nanshi, and then dropped more than twenty bombs in Dongjiadu and Wangjia Wharf, killing and injuring many civilians. Also, the Shiliupu Police Station was bombed, killing and injuring more than a dozen policemen. A bomb hit a civilian house in Wangjia Wharf and started a fire, burning down two houses. Also, a cannon shell hit the Baoqin Rice Shop on the east side of Sanpailou Road, Zhaojiabang Road in the city, collapsing the front building of the house, and also injuring three women and one man on the road, all of whom were killed. In addition, an empty car, parked on the side of the road, was also bombed and destroyed. Also, a stray bullet hit a passerby on Wangyun Road, the south end of Zhaojiabang Road, who was seriously injured and died. Several others were slightly injured and were taken to Renji Hospital by the Fire Brigade ambulance.</p>
<p>At about 2 PM, more than a dozen enemy planes, divided into teams of two or three planes each, dropped more than ten bombs in the Damatou, Nanhui Hall, Wangjia Wharf, and Dongjiadu areas of Nanshi. Several houses were bombed, and some fell into the Huangpu River. The number of deaths and injuries is unknown. When enemy planes formed a team to bomb Nanshi, a piece of shrapnel flew into the office of the bailiff of the Special No. 2 Court on Xuhuali Road, shattering a glass window. Also, shrapnel fell on the open space in front of the registration office across the street, but fortunately no one was injured. Later, our troops opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, and the enemy planes fled to the northwest. Also, enemy planes dropped absurd leaflets in the Nanyang Bridge Ximen area.</p>
<p>Pudong: Yesterday, enemy planes circled and bombed a corner of Pudong all day long. At about 1 PM, a bomb was dropped on Tangmu Bridge. The bomb fell on the empty field of Dayi Middle School behind the Catholic Church, so there were no deaths or injuries because the students were in class at the time. At about 2 PM, two more bombs were dropped in Chuansha, one fell in Lakeside Park, injuring two people, and one fell next to a blacksmith shop on Nanmen Street. One customer was killed on the spot, and about seven or eight others were injured. At about 3 PM, two enemy planes spotted a refugee boat over Xinlu and dropped four bombs. Due to poor technology, none of them hit. The two planes then took turns strafing with machine guns. For a time, bullets flew everywhere, and six people were injured. At 4:30 PM, it was raining. In the drizzle, enemy planes were still soaring in the sky. Several planes flew to Lannima Wharf, dropped many heavy bombs, and opened fire with machine guns. Many people were injured in the bombing and were sent to Renji Hospital by the rescue team. Eight people were seriously injured and five people were slightly injured. Later, five bombs were dropped in Gong Town, and most of them hit busy areas in the town. One bomb hit a night boat that was full of passengers and was about to set sail. As a result, corpses were piled up in the river, and even more people were injured, about fifty or more, which was extremely tragic.</p>

One of our units bravely counterattacked, and a fierce battle broke out, killing a large number of enemies and destroying one of their armored vehicles.

It has now mobilized on several routes simultaneously, advancing towards Shijiazhuang and Dezhou. Feng's troops have crossed Ji County and are heading towards Hejian and Renqiu.

<p>⊙ Xinxiang: Although the number of enemy troops invading northern Henan is not large, and they have been under heavy threat in the rear and on both wings due to our fierce counterattacks in recent days, the enemy's brutal acts in the occupied areas have aroused the indignation of our broad masses. More than ten counties in northern Henan have established mobilization committees one after another, arming no less than 300,000 civilians, who have successively joined the front line to resist the enemy. Moreover, compatriots in central Hebei, western Hebei, and northern Hebei, unable to bear the enemy's trampling, have risen up to resist. Everywhere, as our army has actively counterattacked and recaptured many towns, the compatriots in these areas have become more excited, raising the banner of righteousness, and those who respond are surging like a tide. It is reported that the righteous army in the counties belonging to Baoding, led by Tian and Wu, has more than 6,000 people, fully armed. The militia in a certain county in northern Hebei, led by Gao, has more than 5,000 people. Wei, leading more than 2,000 people along the Pingjin line, can all echo each other, posing a threat to the enemy. Their weapons are mostly obtained from guerrilla warfare. Similar actions are taking place everywhere else. At present, the active situation of the righteous army in Hebei Province is similar to that of the Northeast after the September 18th Incident. In the future, it will surely converge into a huge force with the progress of our frontal troops' counterattack, causing the enemy to collapse completely. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

They also threw poisonous water into the river at Midu Bridge outside Fengmen. A part of the Sulun Yarn Factory was also destroyed. Seventy civilian houses were destroyed at the west end of Shantang Street, and many civilians were killed and injured. The electric light circuits in various places were also damaged. The enemy planes bombing defenseless cities so recklessly further demonstrates their disregard for international law and humanity. In the afternoon, enemy reconnaissance planes flew to Suzhou from time to time to hover and distribute absurd leaflets. Although the enemy planes harassed endlessly all day, our general public was very calm, but their hatred for the enemy was deepened. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Japanese planes had not come to the capital for a week. They attacked again this afternoon.

It is believed that there are still six fighters flying above the bombers. The sound of anti-aircraft guns suddenly became loud, but because the Japanese planes were flying very high, they could not be hit. The Japanese planes then dropped four or five bombs at the flying field outside Guanghua Gate. According to a certain foreigner, he saw several Chinese fighters fighting with Japanese planes. At that time, the sound of machine guns was very rapid, but it is not known whether it came from the planes or from the ground firing at the sky. (Central News Agency 10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙ Linfen: Taiyuan is now making preparations to defend the city. In order to avoid the destruction of enemy artillery fire, many residents are continuing to evacuate. Since the 1st, refugees have been constantly on the roads of Tongpu Road and Tai Fen Road. The enemy planes have wantonly carried out tyranny, arbitrarily bombing the refugees who are non-combatants on the way. In Fenhebian and Jiexiu Station alone, the number of people who were tragically slaughtered reached as many as five to six hundred. According to witnesses, the enemy planes bombed and strafed the above two places in particular. Corpses were piled up everywhere, and severed limbs and mutilated bodies were everywhere in sight. Those who were fortunate enough to escape unscathed were searching for the remains of their relatives, and the sound of wailing and the cries for help from the wounded and dying shook the heavens and the earth. The cruelty of the enemy army has completely extinguished human nature. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Puppet Organization Established in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Wang Gongs of Various Leagues and Banners Insist on Not Submitting</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After the enemy troops entered Suiyuan, they used their usual tricks of coercion and inducement, forcing the leagues and banners of Ximeng to break away from the Central Government. Last month, they convened the so-called "Inner Mongolia League and Banner Representatives Conference" to establish a puppet organization. However, according to reliable information, among the five ministries and thirteen banners under the jurisdiction of the Ulanqab and Ikhaod Leagues in Suiyuan, only the Wang Gongs of the Siziwang Banner and Xingmaoming'an Banner of the U League were forced to turn against them. Other ministries and banners, such as Zhonggong, Ushin, Otog, and Ulata, although under the threat of a strong enemy, still firmly refuse to submit. The Hangjin Banner even issued a telegram after the establishment of the pseudo-organization, expressing its support for the Central Government's bright attitude. The general public in Inner Mongolia is even more eager for the National Army to recover the lost land as soon as possible and break away from the shackles of the Japanese invaders.

<h3>Litvinov Returns to Moscow, Prospects for Brussels Conference Dim</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting Was Very Short, With Little Discussion, Waiting for Japan's Reply Until Saturday to Reconvene</p>
<p>⊙ Brussels: The Chairman of the Brussels Nine-Power Conference, Spaak, stated at the afternoon meeting today that he had received news from the Japanese government that Japan's reply to the application would arrive in Brussels on Friday. Upon hearing this, everyone decided to adjourn the meeting until 11:00 a.m. on Saturday to allow the representatives to have ample time to study Japan's reply. Thus, today's meeting adjourned at 3:45 p.m. However, before the adjournment, British Foreign Secretary Eden, Belgian Prime Minister Spaak, French Foreign Minister Delbos, US Representative Davis, Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, and Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin, successively delivered eulogies to former British Prime Minister MacDonald. (Central News Agency 10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙ Brussels: The sudden departure of Litvinov, the chief Soviet representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, to Moscow has become the main topic of discussion among the representatives today. It is generally believed that Litvinov's departure is due to the fact that someone is agitating against the Soviet Union's inclusion in the small group of mediation committee to be established, and is therefore expressing his opposition by this means. Before his departure, Litvinov visited the chief American representative Davis and the chief British representative Eden. The Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin is still here and will serve as the chief Soviet representative. At the same time, the organization of the small group committee to deal with Japan's reply has been temporarily shelved. It is planned to decide how to deal with it after Japan's reply is received. Today, the European Armistice Commemoration will be held here, and a dinner will be held. Davis, Eden, and British Dominion Minister MacDonald will all attend. In addition to meeting with Litvinov yesterday, Eden also received Davis, Spaak, and Guo Taiqi. (Central 10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙ Brussels: Litvinov, the chief Soviet representative, departed for home at 9:10 p.m. last night. Before his departure, he gave a speech to reporters, saying, "This trip is a scheduled plan. Once the work of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference enters an active stage, and I must attend in person, I will still come here again. The matter of the organization of the small group committee must be submitted for discussion after Japan's reply is sent. It is too early to speak about it at the moment."

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Carries Confidential Plan and Talks Lengthily with Davis</h3>
<p>⊙ Brussels: British Foreign Secretary Eden arrived here by plane from London at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. According to British sources, Eden's visit to Brussels this time carries a new motion. Therefore, this week, the conference will have an important decision on the fate of the Far East. It is said that London is still adopting the original plan of conducting negotiations with China and Japan through Britain, the United States, and Russia. Japanese figures have stated their opposition to this attempt, saying that Japan refuses mediation, but only engages in direct negotiations with China. As soon as Eden arrived at the Capital Hotel, he held a lengthy talk with US Chief Representative Davis. It is believed that Eden will study a "formula" with the United States and France, and jointly take charge of the proceedings. (10th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiang Baili Denies Outside Mediation to Quell Rumors</h3>
<p>⊙ Brussels: Jiang Baili's trip to Germany has sparked rumors. In order to dispel doubts, Jiang declared today that this trip was intended to clarify China's true position in the war of resistance against Japan. The rumor that China is considering the efforts of a third party to mediate outside the Brussels Conference is not true. China has had direct negotiations with Japan for the past four or five years, but unfortunately, they have been fruitless. Therefore, the Chinese government firmly believes that direct negotiations between China and Japan cannot resolve this war and will only give Japan the opportunity to propose unreasonable conditions to impose on China. All conditions that China cannot accept, the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty should also not accept. (Central News Agency 10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[New York] After the rumor of German mediation in the Sino-Japanese dispute spread, the local newspapers already felt a negative impression. Recently, Italy has also joined the German-Japanese Anti-Communist Pact, and the newspapers are even more suspicious, saying that Italy's actions are to support Japan, so that it can continue to implement its expansionist policy towards China with cruel methods. The "New York Times" carried a report, stating that "The task of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to safeguard the rights of all countries in the Far East and to maintain the status quo in the Far East. The Anti-Communist Pact formed by the three countries of Italy, Germany, and Japan is no different from an alliance treaty, and is sufficient to increase the difficulties of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference."

<h3>Japan's Attitude is Stubborn, Saying it Will Tear Up the Treaty</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The opinion of the local newspapers today is that as a result of the plan set by the Beijing Conference, Japan will be forced to withdraw from the Nine-Power Treaty. The "Daily News" declares that Japan, in view of the current evolution of the situation, has made its withdrawal from the treaty inevitable. The Japanese Foreign Ministry is currently considering all aspects of this issue, determined to "abandon the shackles of the past." The newspaper also lists three results, all of which are sufficient to make Japan withdraw from the treaty: ㊀ If the conference explicitly defines Japan as an aggressor or confirms Japan as a treaty violator; ㊁ If the Brussels Conference cannot achieve any definite results, it will prove that the Nine-Power Treaty cannot be maintained; ㊂ If Japan's request to amend the treaty is rejected, Japan will decide to withdraw from this "outdated and unsuitable" treaty in any of the above three situations.

<h3>British Prime Minister Chamberlain's Speech on the International Situation</h3>
<p>Hopes for Practical Cooperation from the United States to Stop the Sino-Japanese War Soon</p>
<p>[London] Last night, the Mayor of London held a banquet at the City Council. Prime Minister Chamberlain gave an impromptu speech, discussing the Sino-Japanese situation. He stated that the British government believes the Brussels Conference has a very high hope of reaching an agreement on a ceasefire, so that a solution can be negotiated based on appropriate principles. The key factor in any attempt to achieve a solution is the cooperation of the United States. The protracted nature of the war only increases the losses of all major countries involved. Britain is now eager for all countries to resolve their differences and move towards consensus. The British government views the U.S. government's willingness to cooperate with other countries at the Brussels Conference as the most valuable first step towards implementing President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago. In his speech, President Roosevelt hoped that all peace-loving countries would work together to uphold the dignity of treaties and resolve international disputes peacefully. The British government deeply believes that closer understanding and more complete shared interests between Britain and the United States will greatly contribute to President Roosevelt's appeal. This appeal is highly aligned with Britain's aspirations. Chamberlain then discussed Britain's relationship with the two powers participating in the Rome-Berlin Axis, saying that the British government sincerely hopes that this relationship can be solidified on the basis of mutual friendship and understanding. He believes that such understanding will greatly contribute to the restoration of trust and security in Europe, and that informal discussions are more likely to succeed than public declarations. The Prime Minister also said that Britain must aim to strengthen the authority of the League of Nations. Finally, he described the astonishing progress in the world's overall economy since 1932. The Prime Minister concluded his speech on a hopeful note, saying, "I am confident that we will find a way to free the world from the pain of armaments and the panic caused by them, and open up a happier and more rational future for mankind."

<h3>Molotov Declares the Soviet Union Needs Peace</h3>
<p>Expresses Limitless Sympathy for Those Suffering Aggression</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet People's Committee held a meeting on the 6th of this month, during which Committee Chairman Molotov issued a statement. He stated that the Soviet Union's sympathy for the Chinese people and its feelings about Japanese aggression can be demonstrated by the signing of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. Soviet foreign policy has not changed. The Soviet Union needs peace and does not endorse foreign adventures. However, it is possible that certain fascist countries deliberately intend to involve our country in adventures. Therefore, we will always pay close attention to our military preparations. The Soviet Union has always expressed sympathy for all nations suffering from foreign aggression, so it is willing to support both Spain and China. However, it is surprising that no country has stepped forward to find a way to stop Japan's unprecedented act of aggression in China. (Central News Agency, 10th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Thirty-Two French Friendship Groups Demand Government Aid to China</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Send Telegrams to Beijing, Requesting Sanctions Against the Aggressor Country</p>
<p>[Paris] The "Association of Friends of the Chinese People," organized by the French General Confederation of Labor, the People's Front parties, the French National Confederation of Veterans, and the World Committee Against War, a total of thirty-two organizations, held a meeting today and passed a resolution. It was immediately sent to the chief representatives of the nineteen countries at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. This resolution demands that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference confirm Japan's aggression against China and prohibit the supply of funds and raw materials to Japan. The resolution also stated that the economic and political power of the countries concerned is far superior to that of Japan. If they want to stop the aggression and restore peace in the Far East, it is easy. In addition, the Association of Friends of the Chinese People also decided to submit three requests to the French government: 1) Provide China with greater assistance; 2) Maintain China's maritime and land transportation with foreign countries; 3) The French representatives attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference should support China's proposals. (Central News Agency, 10th, Havas)</p>
<p>Beijing Chinese commercial and cultural organizations from various places sent telegrams to the representatives of the Nine-Power Treaty today, requesting international sanctions against Japan. For example, the New York Chinese Chamber of Commerce telegraphed: "We, the overseas Chinese businessmen in New York, respectfully ask you to uphold your position so that China can receive the fairest treatment in the end. Please punish our enemies based on the principles recognized by international law and international treaties." (National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Britain's Military Expansion Over the Past Two Years Has Been Remarkable</h3>
<p>Simultaneous Progress in the Navy, Army, and Air Force; Expenditures Close to 300 Million Pounds</p>
<p>[London] The British government has been actively expanding its military for two years, and the achievements have been remarkable. This can be seen in the statement made by Sir Inskip, Minister for Coordination of Defense. Sir Inskip recently declared that, in addition to the existing arsenals and aircraft factories, 58 new ones have been added. As for the air force, there are five large factories manufacturing new types of parts, but the efficiency of these factories will not reach its peak until six months later. In addition, there are many aviation technology research institutes, which are instructed to find ways to improve the newly manufactured parts to ensure that they are as good as possible. All inventions are kept strictly secret. It is expected that in five or six years, other countries will not be able to attack Britain from the air. As for the navy, many old shipbuilding factories that had been shut down have been reopened. This year, a total of 150 large and small warships are scheduled to be launched, including six cruisers. There are also four cruisers, nine destroyers, and five battleships scheduled to be launched before 1940. As for the army, the new light tanks invented last March have already been manufactured in large quantities.

<h3>Former British Prime Minister MacDonald Dies</h3>
<p>Dies of Heart Attack En Route to South America; Came from a Poor Background and Served as Prime Minister Three Times in His Life</p>
<p>[London] Former British Prime Minister MacDonald embarked on the "Pacific Queen" passenger ship to South America a few days ago. He suddenly suffered a heart attack and died on board at the age of 71. His remains will be unloaded when the ship arrives at the British Bermunda Islands in the Atlantic on the 15th of this month. (Central News Agency, 10th, Havas)</p>
<p>MacDonald's Brief Biography</p>
<p>James Ramsay MacDonald was born on October 15, 1866, in Lossiemouth, north of Moray, Scotland. His family was destitute when he was young, but fortunately, his grandmother, taught him strictly, so that he could barely finish his common studies. Later, he studied diligently and tirelessly, and finally acquired both learning and cultivation. At the age of twenty, MacDonald left his hometown for London. He had nothing but himself and had to work to make a living. He earned 15 shillings to a pound a week, and he had to send part of it back to Lossiemouth to support his family. During this period, MacDonald actively participated in the lives of workers, and his inclination towards socialism began at this time. MacDonald joined the labor movement, often giving speeches at workers' gatherings, gradually showing his talent. The labor movement had two major goals: to reduce working hours and increase wages. MacDonald's views were more far-reaching and aligned with modern socialism. In 1895, MacDonald participated in the election for a member of parliament for the first time in Southampton, but he failed. In 1900, he was elected secretary of the Labour Party. In the same year, he participated in the election in Leicester, but he failed again. In 1906, as the leader of the Independent Labour Party, he competed in Leicester again and finally won the election. He was a member of parliament for the city for twelve years. In 1911, he left the Independent Labour Party and became the leader of the orthodox Labour Party. After failing in the election in 1918, he was re-elected in Aberavon four years later. The following year, a cabinet crisis occurred, and MacDonald emerged to form a cabinet, serving as prime minister. This was the first Labour cabinet in British history. MacDonald had to obtain the support of the Liberal Party and deal with the various criticisms from the far left of the Labour Party, making the task very difficult. By 1924, the Labour Party's election was defeated, and he resigned. His relationship with the Labour Party became increasingly tense. As for domestic affairs, he advocated compromise on the transport workers' strike in 1926, thus openly conflicting with the General Confederation of Labour, which supported the strike. As for diplomacy, the party often criticized MacDonald for not having enough courage to implement the various principles he believed in. But MacDonald, having retired to the opposition, could constantly attack the government in the House of Commons, which greatly helped restore his past reputation. After five years of struggle, his position in the party gradually recovered, and he finally formed the second Labour cabinet in 1929. But the tide of economic panic had already become unstoppable. In July 1931, the Cabinet's Economic Committee announced that the budget deficit had reached a huge 120 million pounds, while the number of unemployed workers continued to increase. Although the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States lent 25 million pounds to the Bank of England in August, it was still a drop in the bucket. The Economic Committee concluded that the only way to remedy the situation was to implement austerity policies. MacDonald immediately expressed his support. At this point, all members of the Labour Party's cabinet believed that it was difficult to continue cooperation because they opposed the method of reducing wages, so they resigned on August 21, and the cabinet crisis occurred. Later, King George V hurriedly returned to Beijing from Balmoral Palace and urgently summoned MacDonald, Conservative Party leader Baldwin, and Liberal Party leader Samuel for consultation. The next day, MacDonald was ordered to form a National Cabinet. The late Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Snowden, proposed the so-called emergency budget in the House of Commons on September 10. On the 21st of that month, the British government also announced the abandonment of the gold standard. On October 10, elections were held in the House of Commons, and the Conservative Party won a majority. Only MacDonald and Lansbury were re-elected as members of the National Labour Party, so MacDonald's Labour Party leader was largely a nominal title. By November 1935, he was suffering from eye disease and had to rely on the Conservative Party in the House of Commons. He requested resignation on the grounds that he could not cope physically. Conservative Party leader Baldwin took the opportunity to form a cabinet. In order to maintain the nature of the National Cabinet, he still served as Lord President of the Council as the leader of the National Labour Party. In April 1937, when the World Sugar Conference was held in London, he was elected chairman. After the coronation ceremony of King George VI in May, he and Baldwin retired at the same time until now.

<h3>A Strategic Masterpiece</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Our army in Shanghai West has retreated. The enemy concentrated on landing on the Jinshanwei area has disturbed the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line. But in the sense of a war of attrition, the Shanghai battle can be said to be quite successful.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the war, our military authorities realized that Shanghai could not be defended for long. This area, because it was subject to the restrictions of the truce agreement, could not be used for national defense arrangements in peacetime. It is conceivable how difficult it would be to rely solely on temporary defensive works to resist the full-scale offensive of the enemy's naval, land, and air forces. However, for the sake of national glory, political and economic relations, and to deplete the enemy's strength, we decided to hold Shanghai firmly. We have defended this indefensible place for three months, and now Nanshi is still in our hands. Isn't this something we should be proud of?</p>
<p>Moreover, our army has never been poisoned by the enemy's tricks of sneak attacks or encirclement. Every retreat has been very quick, very calm, and very orderly. Even the recent sneak attack by the enemy in Jinshanwei cannot be said to be entirely due to our army's negligence. Because the prior withdrawal of our main force in that direction, like the retreat of our army in Shanghai West, was clearly based on a pre-determined strategy by our military authorities. The essence of this strategy lies in concentrating the main force and fighting a war of attrition with the enemy.</p>
<p>Foreign military observers have called the retreat of our army in Shanghai West this time a "strategic masterpiece." (See yesterday's English-language "China Press") Our military authorities truly deserve this praise.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's Son Presents a Letter to President Roosevelt as a Tribute</h3>

<h3>Unity First</h3>
<p>— Hu Yuzhi</p>
<p>In the past few days, some new military changes have taken place on the northern and southern battlefields. In the suburbs of Shanghai, our troops, with the exception of a portion who are defending Nanshi to the death, have mostly begun to retreat to a new line of defense in Kunshan, Songjiang, and Jiaxing. Our troops in North China have also withdrawn from Taiyuan and are expanding mobile warfare throughout Shanxi Province. In terms of the overall war situation, this military change cannot be regarded as a failure. Because our troops in Shanghai have withdrawn from the enemy's naval fire line and are holding a second line of national defense with stronger defensive works, in terms of military effect, it is absolutely advantageous to us. As for the fall of Taiyuan, it was already expected. Moreover, the deeper the enemy penetrates, the more difficult it will be to control the entire war situation in North China. In the sense of depleting the enemy's strength, there is no need to be pessimistic.</p>
<p>Even if we take a step back and say that we have already experienced a failure, this failure is natural and was expected. In the long-term war of resistance against Japan, we will inevitably experience multiple failures, not just once or twice, but possibly ten or a hundred times. We originally did not want to rely on military superiority to defeat the enemy, but on our nation's determination to resist the war to eliminate the enemy. Therefore, our final victory must be accumulated from ten or a hundred failures. Failure is not terrible, what is terrible is that we ourselves are not resolute and that we are not united internally. But unity is more important than resoluteness, because if we are not united internally, we will definitely not be able to resolutely resist the war to the end.</p>
<p>Unity is everything. If we are not united internally, we will never have this war of resistance. During the September 18th Incident, we could not launch a war of resistance because we were not united internally. The January 28th War was abandoned halfway because we were not yet united. This time we were able to mobilize the strength of the whole country to fight a decisive battle with the Japanese bandits because we have already united internally. In terms of the situation on the northern and southern battlefields, our army in Shanghai has shown extraordinary bravery and created an unprecedented record of victory in military terms. This is because on the eastern battlefield, the command is absolutely unified, and the unity between the army and the people, and between the people and the government, is also relatively strong. On the contrary, the several defeats in the war in North China were mostly due to the lack of unified command and the lack of strong unity.</p>
<p>Unity against foreign aggression is an old saying. But precisely because it is an old saying, it is easy to be ignored by the general public. Although in times of extreme urgency, some narrow-minded people often forget the meaning of unity due to temporary personal impulses. All past grievances should have been completely abandoned, but because the infection is already deep, it may sometimes reappear in the heart. In addition, the enemy and traitors are always shooting cold arrows and scheming, using every opportunity to undermine our internal unity. It doesn't matter if the military is winning victories, but whenever there are military setbacks or changes in the situation, the general public is easily shaken. Therefore, in the midst of the war of resistance, the enemy's planes, cannons, and poison gas, no matter how terrible, are definitely not more terrible than the conspiracies and tricks that undermine unity. Because planes, cannons, and poison gas can only destroy part of our positions, while conspiracies and tricks that undermine unity can cancel our will to resist the war and put us in a situation of eternal damnation.</p>
<p>There are thousands of conspiracies and tricks that the enemy uses to undermine our internal unity, but the main ones are no more than two methods: using the words "communist" and "red" to provoke and alienate our upper-level elements, and inciting our people to stand against the government. Both of these methods are very clumsy. Anyone who is slightly sensible will neither believe that the result of the war of resistance will lead to communism, nor will they advocate standing against the government when the country is in serious trouble. But all those who are naive, narrow-minded, and value personal interests above all else, will often be shaken by this kind of provocation. If they are shaken about the future of the war of resistance, they will intentionally or unintentionally reveal the idea of compromise halfway through. If one person doesn't matter, two people don't matter, but if hundreds or thousands of people advocate compromise halfway through, the enemy's provocation and tricks will achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang clearly instructed us: "We already understood the greatness of the power of national unity and national unification when the war of resistance began. We must show our unity and strengthen our unity even more in the midst of the war of resistance." If even today, when the war of resistance is continuing to progress in the process of victory, there are still people who mistakenly believe that the war of resistance will lead to communism and therefore hesitate to move forward, or if there are still people who oppose the government and therefore passively shirk their duties, it is tantamount to carrying out the enemy's orders to undermine our unity. For the sake of the future of the nation and the country, this kind of psychology of national destruction must be eradicated.</p>
<p>We are not afraid of failure, and we are not afraid of difficulties. We must be prepared to deal with all failures and difficulties, and what we must not forget for a moment is "unity first."</p>
<h3>Dutch Sailor's Letter Describes Tense Situation in Japan</h3>
<p>Son of Tea Merchant Opposes War and Commits Suicide; Prices Soar, Market Abnormally Depressed</p>
<p>Recently, we received a letter from a crew member of a Dutch merchant ship, describing what he saw and heard during his passage through Japan. According to the letter, the ship regularly sails between the South Seas islands and Japan. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>The ship passed through Miike Port, Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, Yokohama, and other ports. Before August 13th, foreign crew members could freely disembark. However, this time, landing was completely prohibited, and security was tight, preventing any deviation. Every night, fearing air raids by our air force, all lights were extinguished on land and sea, creating a very terrifying situation, turning the prosperous commercial ports into a dark world.</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities have detained hundreds of merchant ships from the sailor's country, using them to transport troops and supplies. Troop movements at various ports are exceptionally hurried. Twenty to thirty transport ships set sail daily. Each ship only stayed at the dock for three to four hours before loading up again and departing. The situation is extremely tense.</p>
<p>Chinese residents in Japan are returning to China in droves. Those who are economically well-off are mostly transferring to various ports in the South Seas. They spoke in detail on the ship about the situation in Japan.</p>
<p>The Japanese military is forcibly conscripting merchants and civilians. Anyone receiving a conscription notice must report immediately. Those who fail to report on time will be executed on the spot. There have been instances of merchants and civilians committing suicide to avoid conscription. The son of a tea merchant in Tokyo was among those conscripted. However, he opposed the war and committed suicide to avoid service. Before his suicide, he told people that whether he was conscripted or not, he would die anyway, and that dying by suicide at home was better than dying in Shanghai.</p>
<p>It is estimated that only over two million people in Japan are registered for military service. From before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident to September 15th, approximately one million troops have been transported to North China and Shanghai to fight. After September 15th, the number transported would not have been small. Over three hundred political figures have been arrested for opposing the war.</p>
<p>Domestic prices have soared, increasing by fifty percent compared to normal times. The market is depressed, and people are in disarray. Because of the excessive deaths of those conscripted to fight in China, the Taishu Shato party has raised questions, demanding that the government resolve and respond to: (1) the issue of relief for the families of soldiers on expeditions, and (2) how to remedy the high prices. The government has been unable to resolve and respond.</p>
<p>Japan is a newly emerging industrial nation, relying entirely on foreign trade as its lifeblood. Since the outbreak of war, foreign trade has plummeted, and the economy is in extreme distress. The financial system is fundamentally shaken, foreign exchange is prohibited, raw material imports have ceased, and almost all factories have shut down. Workers who are not suffering from the pain of conscription are also suffering from the worry of unemployment. Their resentment and hatred toward the authorities' militaristic policy are overflowing.</p>
<h3>Residents of Caohejing Town Scattered and Displaced</h3>
<p>City Committee Sends Refugees to Evacuate; Enemy Forces Occupy, Gaining Nothing</p>
<p>At 4:00 AM on the 9th, it was learned that our positions on the south bank of the Suzhou River were being withdrawn for strategic reasons. The local government in Caohejing Town in western Shanghai, being in a vital location, had to prepare for evacuation. The City Committee of the area supervised all members of the defense corps to notify residents of the entire town to assemble urgently. Rescue trucks were used to transport women, children, and the elderly to Shanghai first. Men walked in formation, reluctantly leaving the town around 7:00 AM, heading east along Xietu Road to temporary shelters in Houjiabang Jishen Temple, Guangfu Temple, and Zijin Elementary School inside Xinbei Gate. An estimated four to five hundred refugees were rescued. However, due to the limited number of vehicles and the large number of people, not everyone could be transported. Along the way, they were hit by stray bullets, causing deaths and injuries along Caoxi Road and Xietu Road, which was shocking. In addition, more than ten enemy aircraft pursued and strafed, causing rumors to spread like bees and people to panic. The reporter was fortunate to escape unharmed amidst the flying bullets, feeling as if he had been reborn.</p>
<p>On the 10th, someone who escaped from Caohejing Town in western Shanghai said that on the morning of the 9th, more than ten enemy aircraft bombed the town, destroying many houses. A bomb hit the police station next to Wanshou Nunnery, and Jinrong Bridge was also bombed and broken. By the afternoon, enemy troops were spotted in the town and Longhua at the same time, and they were immediately burned and massacred. The residence of Yang Xiaomao in Yangjiagang, Gangnan, caught fire and burned. Doors and windows of shops in the town were all opened, and internal losses were considerable. Nearby villagers, unable to escape in time, were brutally killed, about a dozen of them. Among them, Zhang Jinxiang and Zhang Qiulin's wives were shot and their bodies abandoned on the road. The Yang residence in the town has been occupied by the enemy's headquarters. Fortunately, the residents fled, so although the enemy occupied the area, they gained nothing.</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Praises the Effectiveness of Our Military's Resistance</h3>
<p>Japan Forced to Concentrate Main Forces on China, Spending Huge Expenditures</p>
<p>National Maritime News Agency Frankfort, 10th - The Frankfurter Zeitung published a long article today, praising the loyalty and bravery of the Chinese army. The article believes that the Chinese army's ability to resist the Japanese army, which is superior in equipment and weaponry, for three months is "a military achievement worthy of the highest praise." The newspaper continued, although the Chinese army's retreat in Shanghai was a major blow to the patriotic emotions of the Chinese people, it is by no means enough to diminish the special meritorious service of the Chinese army's long-term resistance. The newspaper pointed out that the Japanese army has repeatedly attempted to break through the Chinese line of defense, but has failed. The courage and determination of each Chinese soldier exceeds the Shanghai battle five years ago by an immeasurable degree. It continued, China's months of resistance have not been in vain, because Japan has been forced to concentrate its main forces on China and spend huge expenditures in order to achieve some success. The heroism and bravery of the Chinese army has been announced to the whole world, and the Chinese people are willing to sacrifice to protect the independence of their country.</p>
<h3>All Circles Exert Efforts to Purchase National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Rent Used to Offset Bond Purchases; Still Subject to Deliberation and Verification</p>
<p>Using rent to offset purchases of National Salvation Bonds has been widely publicized for a long time, but has not yet been implemented. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Fundraising Corps received a letter from the First Special District Citizens' Federation requesting permission for tenants to purchase bonds on behalf of landlords, using the rent receipt from the most recent month. The corps forwarded the letter to the General Association for instructions. The General Association has now replied, stating that the matter should be handled in accordance with the actual social situation and after careful deliberation and verification.</p>
<p>Business Circles Corps</p>
<p>The National Salvation Bond Fundraising Corps for Business Circles yesterday received reports from various industry sub-teams regarding the amount of bonds subscribed, as follows: insurance industry, fourth batch, 15,335 yuan; coal industry, sixth batch, 18,280 yuan; fundraising committee member Ye Youcai, 20,150 yuan; construction industry, sixth batch, 4,200 yuan; foreign firms' tea, third batch, 3,810 yuan; tung oil and ramie, third batch, 2,500 yuan; paper industry, ninth batch, 2,250 yuan; gold industry, sixth batch, 539 yuan; cotton industry, sixth batch, 2,000 yuan; tea-making industry, third batch, 500 yuan; copper, iron, and machinery, third batch, 310 yuan; barber industry, second batch, 260 yuan; steel bars and scrap iron, tenth batch, 295 yuan; restaurant industry, third batch, 200 yuan; advertising industry, third batch, 100 yuan. The total is 70,720 yuan. As of today, the total amount raised is 18,655,852.83 national currency.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson Chinese Employees</p>
<p>Chinese employees of British firm Jardine Matheson, seeing the rampant atrocities of Japanese invaders and the severity of the national crisis, decided to economize and purchase National Salvation Bonds to fulfill their duty as people in the rear to defend the country. Yesterday, the general manager of the Chinese staff, Mr. Pan Zhiquan, took the lead by subscribing 5,000 yuan; his brother Zhiheng, 1,000 yuan; Pan Yuchu, 300 yuan; Bao Guochang and Li Yunan, 200 yuan each; Lin Ruixiang, Zheng Yiqiao, Ouyang Shaotang, and Jin Zuochen, 100 yuan each; Fei Xiaohou, Wu Zhongdong, and Ou Junxiang, 50 yuan each; Li Bianxiang, 30 yuan; and Zhong Jibiao and others, totaling several thousand yuan. It is heard that Mr. Pan Zhiquan is naturally charitable. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, in addition to raising funds for bonds, he independently established a wounded soldier hospital, complete with internal facilities.</p>
<p>Hospitalized Wounded Soldiers</p>
<p>All the wounded soldiers residing in the Cilianhui Relief Committee for War Zone Refugees Rescue Hospital, in view of the fact that the fundraising for National Salvation Bonds has not yet reached half the amount, which is sufficient to affect the future of the war, although they are temporarily unable to return to the front to kill the enemy, their heart to save the country is still not behind others. They consulted and agreed to fast for one day, using the saved food expenses to subscribe for National Salvation Bonds. The hospital director, Mr. Huang Dinghu, deeply admired their enthusiasm for saving the country. However, fasting would harm their health and indirectly affect the strength of the war effort. Therefore, Mr. Huang led all the staff to donate 188 yuan to purchase National Salvation Bonds, replacing the wounded soldiers' fasting, and reported the situation to the committee. The committee highly praised the patriotic enthusiasm of the wounded soldiers and all the hospital staff.</p>
<p>Hardware Industry</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Salvation Bond Sub-Team by the Shanghai Metal Parts Industry Association, Captain Yu Wenbiao and others have worked hard to promote it, encouraging all members to purchase bonds. All members enthusiastically subscribed. The association's predetermined goal was 10,000 yuan, and it has now exceeded the predetermined goal, with a total of more than 15,000 yuan raised.</p>
<p>Donating Platinum Rings</p>
<p>The National Salvation Bond Fundraising Association yesterday received two platinum rings donated by Mr. Yu Peng from the Jiangsu Provincial Branch to offset the purchase of bonds. They were immediately forwarded to the Central Bank in their original packaging, requesting a foreign jewelry store to estimate the price and offset it accordingly.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms' Chinese Employees Association Collects Gloves</h3>
<p>The Foreign Firms' Chinese Employees Association, in view of our loyal and brave soldiers fighting the enemy in bloody battles, launched a glove collection campaign. After appealing to all members to actively donate, it is now known that more than 400 yuan have been raised, which can make about a thousand pairs of good gloves. The association is now stepping up production in order to send them to the front lines for soldiers to keep warm.</p>
<h3>Slight Increase in Prices in the City</h3>
<p>Temporary Excitement Can Be Calmed; Concession Authorities Already Have Measures</p>
<p>Prices in the city have slightly risen yesterday. One national currency can only buy one catty and seven ounces of pork. Due to the changing situation in western Shanghai, it is relatively inconvenient to bring vegetables into the concession area. The wholesale prices of fuel products such as firewood and coal have also shown an upward trend. However, the supply of the above items is smooth, and there is no shortage. The rise in market prices is only a temporary excitement and a temporary phenomenon, which can be calmed. In addition, a few rice shops have slightly reduced their inventory and temporarily closed yesterday morning. It is heard that the concession authorities have prepared good measures and are making every effort to maintain the situation.</p>
<h3>Refugees Fleeing from Southern Shanghai and Pudong to Concessions</h3>
<p>Red Swastika Society and City Boy Scouts Work Hard to Rescue and Send People</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the refugee zone in the southern city area yesterday (9th), the Red Cross flags of the International Relief Committee have been flying in the wind in places such as Lao Bei Men and Minguo Road. Shops in the area had opened for business yesterday. Today, because refugees from the areas of Rihui Port, Fenglin Bridge, and Xietu Road gathered like ants, shops on Minguo Road and other places closed again today. The iron gate connecting Lao Bei Men to the concession was flooded with refugees. The French Concession authorities specially dispatched Chinese and French police, as well as detectives, to stand inside and outside the iron fence, making every effort to maintain order, so that refugees could walk shoulder to shoulder in an orderly manner. Those carrying cages and packages were prohibited from entering the concession. Those with suspicious behavior were subjected to inspection. The reporter then went to Nanyang Bridge to inspect. The situation at the iron gate connecting to the French Concession was no less crowded and noisy than at Lao Bei Men. It is heard that the Xieqiao iron gate has been closed due to the situation. Therefore, the actual passages from the southern city area to the concession are only the above two places.</p>
<p>Also, after our army withdrew from western Shanghai, some troops remained to defend the southern city area, confronting the enemy across Rihui Port. Starting at dawn today, enemy aircraft flew over the southern city area for reconnaissance and indiscriminate bombing. Although the refugee area in the southern city area is still stable, there are still many residents south of the refugee area, numbering no less than hundreds of thousands of people. Since the 9th, they have been rushing to the French Concession to take refuge. There were even more people seeking refuge this morning. At the iron gates of Nanyang Bridge and Lao Bei Men, the crowds waiting to enter the concession were overwhelming. The French authorities stipulated that the Nanyang Bridge side would only allow people to exit the concession and refused entry. The Lao Bei Men side remained open as usual. Therefore, Lao Bei Men was a scene of surging crowds.</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society's relief team learned yesterday morning that many refugees had fled from western Shanghai, the southern city area, and the Pudong area, gathering at various wharves at the new customs, the Bund outside the Public Concession, Fenglin Bridge, the areas adjacent to the French Concession, the rice wharves in the southern city area, and the iron fences of the French Concession, carrying luggage, supporting the old and helping the young, sobbing and calling, which was extremely miserable. They immediately increased the number of ambulances. The entire team set out and rushed to the various places, rescuing refugees in shifts. From morning to night, they rescued more than 5,700 people. In addition to those who went to relatives and friends, they also sheltered hundreds of people. At the same time, they also rescued more than 120 wounded soldiers and sent them to the Fourth Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>In recent days, residents of the Pudong area, because of the rumors that spread after our army withdrew from western Shanghai, have been crossing the Huangpu River to seek refuge. Order at the wharves is particularly chaotic. All the members of the Shanghai City Boy Scout Wartime Service First Regiment stationed in Pudong served day and night at the wharves, and escorted refugees across the river. The refugees were very grateful. Yesterday, refugees gathered at the entrance of the French Concession in Lujiawan, their miserable suffering causing heartbreak. Members of the Shanghai City Boy Scout Seventh District Regiment requested assistance from the French Municipal Council, who sympathized and provided large trucks to transport the refugees to various shelters. This shows the French Concession authorities' efforts to uphold humanitarianism.</p>

<h3>Slight Changes in Foreign Exchange After Our Army's Defense Line Changes</h3>
<p>British and American Exchange Rates Have Contracted; Central and HSBC Exchange Rates Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>After our army withdrew from Zhabei, there were slight changes in the local foreign exchange market. Foreign banks and Japanese banks absorbed together, and the U.S. dollar once softened due to stimulation. By November 2nd, it had tightened to 29.40625 yuan. However, the British pound was still hovering around 1 shilling 2 pence 25. Starting on November 4th, there were sudden changes in the foreign market, and the British and American exchange rates rose by about six points, breaking through the 5 U.S. dollar mark. As a result, the local foreign exchange market also showed a trend of tightening for the British pound and easing for the U.S. dollar. The British pound tightened from 1 shilling 2 pence 25 to 1 shilling 2 pence 1875. Foreign banks and firms such as Xinfeng were hedging, but fortunately, traffic and other sources supplied them, and the overall situation was still supportable. Although there was a large amount of kerosene settlement for the U.S. dollar, Japanese and American dealers were spitting out a lot, so it eased from 29.40625 yuan to 29.6875 yuan. After our army withdrew from the defense line in western Shanghai the day before yesterday, although there was a tight trend in the foreign exchange market, the biggest reason for this was that the British and American exchange rates had contracted. Yesterday, swap transactions in the foreign exchange market were quite lively. Formal transactions included the British pound for November at 1 shilling 2 pence 15625, and the U.S. dollar at around 29.5625 yuan. The swap rate was 125 for the shilling and 3125 for the U.S. dollar. Yesterday's closing prices were: British pound spot at 1 shilling 2 pence 25, November at 140625, December at 015625; U.S. dollar spot at 9.53125 yuan, November at 46875, December at 15625. As for the exchange rates of the Central Bank and HSBC for the British pound and U.S. dollar, they remained stable and unchanged.</p>
<h3>Fujian Fellow Provincial Association Sends Telegram to Military Affairs Commission and Fujian Provincial Government to Severely Punish the Jinmen County Magistrate</h3>
<p>And Provide Generous Pensions to Martyred Strong Men</p>
<p>The Fujian Fellow Provincial Association in Shanghai held a meeting yesterday at its office at No. 64 Jing'an Villa. Jiang Yinan, Wang Pingnan, Chen Zhenming, Chi Lingfei, Weng Xingyu, and dozens of others attended. Jiang Yinan, director of the preparatory committee, presided over the meeting. They discussed the solicitation of affairs officers and the proposal by Chen Zhenming, supervisor of the association, that the fall of Jinmen and the sacrifice of all the strong men under enemy fire for their country should be compared to the Spartan guards and Yao Ying of Baoshan County. The magistrate of the county, Zheng Han, abandoned the city and survived and is now being detained. They should send a telegram to the Military Affairs Commission and the Fujian Provincial Government to punish him to the fullest extent of the law, commend them, and provide generous pensions to the martyred strong men to praise their heroic deeds. The resolution was passed and telegraphed separately yesterday.</p>
<h3>Domestic Manufacturers Stop Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>Telegraph to National Agencies to Maintain Long-Term Resistance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Domestic Manufacturers Association telegraphed to chambers of commerce, anti-enemy support associations, and agencies and public groups in all provinces, cities, and counties across the country, saying: (Omitted titles) Since the violent enemy invaded, the people were motivated by patriotism and implemented economic severance from Japan. The Japanese devils have no plans to show, so they change the appearance of inferior goods, impersonate domestic goods, or European and American goods, collude with traitors, obscure and invade sales. Customs at various places have repeatedly seized them, but with their myriad schemes, they mix the said changed enemy goods into the inland to seek sales, which is still unavoidable. At this juncture of national survival and ethnic life and death, economic resistance is no less important than military resistance. Therefore, we specially telegraph your association to block the enemy goods invading the inland, issue interceptions, and detain any suspicious goods. If you have any questions, our association will inform you of what we know at any time. It concerns the foundation of the country and maintains long-term resistance. We hope you will agree to strictly prohibit enemy goods and not allow any expectations. The Chinese Domestic Manufacturers Association bows, ash.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Orders Investigation of Factory Losses</h3>
<p>Estimate Losses and Damage; Report to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in Writing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry ordering factories to quickly report wartime losses and issued a public announcement saying: Received Qing telegram from the Ministry of Industry saying that the situation of factories destroyed in Shanghai needs to be ascertained, and that the names of factories destroyed before November 1 with capital of more than 200,000 yuan, loss estimates, and dates of destruction should be investigated immediately and telegraphed for reply. In addition to the association issuing letters to other public associations to investigate and report, for quickness, it is re-announced to the public. It is hoped that the owners of the factories will report the estimated losses and destruction in writing to the association on their own accord so that they can be telegraphed. Do not delay. This is the public announcement.</p>
<h3>Situation of Nanhui County Town Being Bombed</h3>
<p>East Main Street Was Damaged; Zhoupu Also Was Bombed</p>
<p>Dr. Qu of Nanhui Public Hospital came to Shanghai from Nanhui yesterday and said that at about 10:00 AM on (the 7th), three enemy aircraft came and circled over the county town several times before dropping four massive bombs. One landed in the garden of the County Junior Girls' Middle School in the city and did not explode. One landed on the back of the school building, destroying a clock tower, but the school building was not affected. Fortunately, the school had already suspended classes, and the students had all dispersed home, so no one was injured. There were still two bombs that landed in the most lively section of East Main Street in the city. The area was hit by a lot of shops. Dozens of shops of all sizes, including Huang Changyu Grain Store, Xubinyuan Restaurant, Wanbaoyuan Pickles, Pinlian Native Products Store, Zhengjie Restaurant, Quan Da Meat Shop, Deyu Salted Goods Shop, and Ronghua Photo Studio, were all destroyed. Many nearby houses were also collapsed by the shock. More than a dozen people were killed and about thirty injured. Among them, Ronghua Photo Studio was opened by Wang Hongzhang. Hongzhang happened to be away on business and was not injured, but his wife and five children were killed. It was very tragic. The local rescue team sent the injured to the public hospital for treatment. The dead were buried by their families, and those without families were buried by the charity association. Most of the residents of Nanhui have now moved, and only a few poor people remain. The larger towns and cities near Nanhui have also been bombed. Zhoupu Town was bombed with more than a dozen bombs, and Shangnan Station, Xishi, and Beishi were bombed, destroying houses and injuring people.</p>
<h3>No Absolute Shortage of Rice in the City</h3>
<p>700,000 Piculs of Rice in Storage and Continuous Purchases from Outside; Rice Industry Association Cracks Down on Taking the Opportunity to Raise Rice Prices</p>
<p>Because our national army moved to a new line of defense and traffic to the concession was obstructed, the price of rice in the city rose sharply again yesterday. Several rice shops even closed their doors, and people could not avoid being affected. The Hua Dong News Agency reporter met with Mr. Gu, a leader in the city's food industry, yesterday afternoon. He asked the reporter to inform the citizens not to panic. There are still 700,000 piculs of rice in storage, and food groups have been selecting and transporting from inland. The reporter personally saw many rice merchants from the interior say that 300,000 piculs of new japonica rice were concentrated and waiting to be transported, which will arrive in Shanghai soon. It is also learned that the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession are also very concerned about the rice problem for Chinese and foreign citizens and are planning to purchase from Hong Kong, Saigon, Siam, and other places. As for yesterday's chaotic situation, it was caused by a few rice merchants secretly raising prices, but the amount of rice in storage is still very sufficient.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources from the Public Works Department, rice merchants have ordered a batch of rice from abroad during the past week, which will soon be available for residents of the city to eat. All the ordered goods have been loaded and transported to Shanghai, which will be enough for three or four weeks. The existing rice in stock in the city is also enough to support for three weeks. Therefore, the rice supply in the city is quite sufficient, and there is no shortage.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Industry Association believes that at this extraordinary time, the people's food is of great importance. Since the end of the People's Food Adjustment Association, some rice merchants have taken the opportunity to raise rice prices. Therefore, it convened an emergency meeting to decide that the prices sold by the same industry should comply with the regulations of the People's Food Association, and should not exceed 14 yuan per picul, in order to maintain the people's food. The Rice and Bean Industry Association announced that all rice shops should follow this, saying: Dear Sirs, at this extraordinary time, the people's food is of utmost importance. All rice market prices should still comply with the previous regulations of the People's Food Adjustment Association, and the selling price should not exceed 14 yuan per picul. All rice shops in the city should abide by this, regardless of whether they are buying or selling, and it is hoped that merchants with goods will understand this intention. If there is any transgression, once it is discovered and verified, it will be reported to the local authorities for severe punishment. It is hoped that all colleagues will pay close attention. This announcement is hereby made.</p>
<h3>Cultural Street Since the War of Resistance (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Huai Qing</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, Shanghai's publishing industry, like the entire city, has fallen into a state of stagnation. The direct and indirect losses have been very significant. Later, as people's hearts gradually stabilized and the market gradually recovered, Cultural Street slowly revived, with the exception of two anti-war publications decorating the silent streets. However, apart from the anti-war pictorials, magazines, and various pamphlets that emerged in response to the times, the publishing industry as a whole was naturally just struggling to cope with this extraordinary period! Now, based on my limited observations, I will give an overview of the situation on Cultural Street since the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>㊀ Dynamics of Bookstores</p>
<p>The Commercial Press, the "trust" of the national publishing industry, suffered the greatest losses during the January 28th Incident. The general printing plant on Baoshan Road and the Oriental Library were completely destroyed by artillery fire, resulting in a six-month suspension of operations. After resuming business, it implemented scientific management and was determined to innovate, and its business gradually prospered. Last year, its business was particularly successful, clearly exceeding the pre-war situation. Taking January to August 14th of this year as an example, in addition to publishing a large number of textbooks and large series of books, the number of new books published daily alone reached 745, totaling 1,009 volumes. Last year, the entire year saw only over 800 titles.</p>
<p>The experience gained by the Commercial Press from the first artillery fire and the lessons learned from the labor disputes after the war have made them particularly meticulous in their administrative organization. In addition to establishing a general plant in Hong Kong, the factories in Shanghai have also been set up in a decentralized manner. Therefore, the direct losses suffered by Shanghai in this war are truly insignificant compared to the January 28th Incident. Although the publication of books was suspended in the second half of August and throughout September, new books and various magazines were continuously printed from October onwards, albeit with a slight reduction in quality and quantity.</p>
<p>The weekly special-priced books announced this year are still being sold, but the discount has been changed from 30% to 20%. The weekly standard books have been discontinued. From October 1st, the daily output of new books is temporarily set at one title per day. As for magazines, the ones that resumed publication in October are *The Eastern Miscellany*, *Education Magazine*, *Children's World*, and *English Weekly*, but due to paper and manpower constraints, they are temporarily published as combined issues every two issues. It is also understood that *Young Pictorial* and *Children's Pictorial* will also be republished within this month.</p>
<p>*Literature Magazine*, a large-scale art publication, is a new publication that inherits the *Fiction Monthly*. It has a fresh face and holds a unique position. It has many categories and is rigorously produced; it is very different from the current popular literary publications. It is a miracle worthy of attention! Unfortunately, it only published four issues before the cruel artillery fire wiped it out, along with other magazines!</p>
<p>The China Book Company published a "Special Period Newspaper Book" very early on. After the outbreak of the war, it was very popular with readers, and the retail department was quite lively. However, they have not published a new book in the past three months. Even the seven magazines they publish only saw news of resumption at the beginning of this month; and only *Teenage Weekly*, *Children's Weekly*, and *China English Weekly* were resumed. Moreover, they are also published as combined issues of two issues.</p>
<p>It is said that not long ago, a large number of books from the China Book Company were transported to other ports, divided into five civilian ships. Unfortunately, they were bombed by enemy aircraft midway, and all were destroyed. This is truly a heartbreaking thing!</p>
<p>The entire printing factories of the Kaiming and World Book Companies are located in enemy war zones, and the losses are very significant. Magazines such as *Middle School Student* and *New Youth* of the Kaiming Bookstore have not been able to resume publication until now. Even *Monthly Report*, which competes with *Digest* and is most popular with readers, has had to temporarily suspend publication.</p>
<p>While various bookstores were deploying and reorganizing in a chaotic situation, the Life Bookstore took this opportunity to become very active, quickly setting up a retail department in the Kangjian Bookstore on Avenue Joffre. More than a dozen titles in the *World Knowledge* series were all works that grasped the current era, and business was indeed not bad.</p>
<p>㊁ Street Bookstalls</p>
<p>Liangyou Pictorial Company, which started with pictorials and turned to specializing in literary works, had its distribution department, warehouses, etc., all located on North Sichuan Road, in the enemy's artillery fire. Although some were moved out, most were sacrificed. Afterwards, thieves risked sneaking into the book warehouse and stole a large number of books, selling them at low prices. For a time, there were bookstalls everywhere on the roads, and the bookstalls were full of colorful and brand-new Liangyou Literary Series and Liangyou Library, etc. Ordinary literary youth, as if they had obtained treasures to buy and collect, competed to buy them, searching everywhere. For one or two yuan in legal tender, they could return fully loaded. The booksellers also made a threefold profit. Customers and sellers both benefited, but Liangyou Company secretly suffered no small loss.</p>
<p>The headquarters of these bookstalls were in two places, one at the intersection of Avenue Road and Carter Road, and the other in the area of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lupan. In the first week, all books, regardless of new or old and value, were sold at 20% of the original price. Later, as more people knew about it, business suddenly flourished, and the selling price also increased to 25% to 30% of the original price. And sometimes, regardless of the marked price of the book, the value was based on the thickness of the book. For example, literary books were originally priced at nine jiao per book regardless of thickness, but on the bookstalls, they were initially sold at two jiao per book, then increased to two and a half jiao, and finally some were sold for three jiao. And those that were thicker, such as Bing Xin's *An Autobiography of a Female Soldier*, Zhang Tianyi's full-length novel *Year*, etc., were often priced even higher.</p>
<p>Some small bookstores also discovered these "backdoor goods", but the selling price was 50% off, and friends who wanted cheap goods would definitely not be fooled.</p>
<p>Of all the books, the Literary Series and the *Anthology of New Chinese Literature* sold the best. And the two essay collections in the *Anthology of New Chinese Literature* were even more popular with readers. Priced at three jiao per book, they were quickly snapped up. The next best sellers were the three novel collections in the *Anthology of New Literature*, which also sold quite well. The collections of construction theory, literary debate, historical materials and indexes, poetry, and drama had fewer customers. It can be seen that the literary tastes and appetites of the masses are the same.</p>
<p>Now the bookstalls have gradually decreased, and most of the Liangyou books have been placed on the desks of every reader. Once, I chatted with a clerk at a bookstall and asked him how these books were stolen. He said that they were disguised as vendors, carrying baskets filled with fruit or peanuts on top, and books inside, and they were gradually stolen in this way. At first, the people who stole the books did not know the value of these books and sold them by the pound as old goods. Later, they learned that these books were very marketable, so they sold them by the book or at 10% of the marked price. I think one or two people and thieves would never have moved out so many books. There may be other reasons behind this, but in short, this is a risky business.</p>
<p>The limelight of the Liangyou literary books on the bookstalls has passed, and many socialist "banned books" published by the Taitong Bookstore have now filled the streets. The paper of these books is old and tattered, but the selling price is not cheap. For example, *Historical Materialism* and *Marx's Biography* by Bukharin, translated by Tao Bo (i.e., Peng Shuzhi, who has been executed), were originally priced at three yuan each, but now they still have to be sold at 60% or 50% off. This is also the trend of the times. These books also clearly have very good sales. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Social Bureau Donates Prizes from the National Games</h3>
<p>Four Hundred and Eighteen Taels, Valued at Fourteen Hundred Gold</p>
<p>This city has won many prizes in past National Games, many of which are pure silver shields, cups, and tripods. In view of the nationwide anti-Japanese war, the Social Bureau of this city has presented silver to the government. The bureau donated 26 items, weighing 410 taels and 3 qian, valued at more than 1,400 yuan, to the Central Bank on the 1st of this month. The bank issued receipt No. 1 with the character "央". The bureau also hopes that sports people in this city will support the donation.</p>

<h3>Dancers' National Salvation Association Members Sell Flowers This Morning</h3>
<p>Comfort and Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dancers' National Salvation Association, in view of the lack of comfort for the wounded soldiers and the cold and hunger of the winter refugees, began to mobilize all its members this morning to present the city flower of Shanghai, a drooping pink ribbon, to the ladies of the society. The minimum price is one jiao, and the association's receipt is prepared. The members who are mobilized all wear a white long ribbon on their chests, with the big blue characters "Presenting you with the glorious city flower". Each team has two people, one holding a pointed paper card with bright city flowers inserted in it, and the other holding a pre-sealed money box with the association's seal on it, and the words "Selling flowers for wounded soldiers and refugees, please gentlemen and ladies give more money". The meaning is profound. It is thought that there are many benevolent people in this city who are willing to do good. It is expected that the results will be considerable.</p>
<h3>Joint Conference of the Singing Circle</h3>
<p>Please Restore the Broadcasting of National Salvation Songs, Strengthen the Strength, and Popularize the Effectiveness</p>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Committee yesterday convened a second joint conference of the heads of singing groups in the city, attended by representatives from the Municipal Organizing Committee, the Women's National Defense Association, the Singing Circle, composers, the cultural circle, the professional circle, the entertainment circle, the education circle, the Boy Scouts, and the youth circle, a total of more than forty groups. First, Chairman Yan Keding reported on the ㊀ implementation of the first resolution and ㊁ the incident of the radio station banning the broadcasting of national salvation songs. Then, Chairman Zhen Xingbai gave a speech, giving detailed instructions on the singing work. Then, the following matters were discussed: ㊀ Request to restore the radio broadcasting of national salvation songs. Four steps were decided, and the Singing Association, the Composers Association, the Cultural Circle National Salvation Association, the Education Circle Wartime Service Corps, and the Broadcasting Association were appointed to handle the matter. ㊁ Request all radio stations across the country to broadcast national salvation songs and establish close contact. ㊂ Request the Ministry of Education to order all schools at all levels across the country to teach national salvation songs and send all the songs to the ministry for reference. ㊃ Investigate the singing work of the Anti-Japanese Support Associations in various provinces and cities and the singing talents in various places.

<h3>Central Trust Savings Bank Changing and Consolidating Council List</h3>
<p>Savings Depositors Will Draw Lots Soon, and There Is Another Chance to Win</p>
<p>The Central Savings Association, upon order, received and consolidated the special prize-winning savings of the China Industrial Bank. It has been handling the exchange of lists since last month. All savings certificates or fixed-term mortgage deeds holding the special prize-winning savings of the China Industrial Bank can be exchanged for consolidated council lists from the association. The procedures are very simple. Once the list is exchanged, it can share all the generous benefits stipulated in the association's charter with the original savings depositors of the association and be included in the lottery on a regular basis. There is a hope of winning the lottery every month. It is heard that many of the special prize-winning savings depositors of the China Industrial Bank who exchanged consolidated council lists with the association before the 19th lottery on October 15th won the lottery in that period. Savings depositors who have not exchanged lists, in view of the fact that exchanging lists one period earlier means one more chance to win the lottery, have been flocking to the association at No. 2 Tianjin Road to exchange lists in recent days.</p>
<h3>The Silver Money Industry Amateur Association's Affairs Continue as Usual</h3>

<h3>Our Qibao Line Retracts, Enemy Launches General Offensive on Nanshi, Forcible Crossing at Rihui Port</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Forcibly Occupy Rihui Port, the British Merchant Kailin Wharf; Enemy Dinghies on Huangpu River Stealthily Attack Nanshi, Repelled by Us; Pudong, Where Our Troops Put Up the Fiercest Resistance, Now Occupied by the Enemy This Morning</p>
<p>The Guangfu-Nanxiang Line Remains Steadfast and Unmoved</p>
<p>Military Update: Our troops along the Jinghu Railway are currently holding the line from Nanxiang to Huangdu. The enemy dares not advance, so there has been no intense fighting on this line. Our troops in Jiangqiao Town have retreated slightly westward. After the retreat from the defense line west of Shanghai, they moved to the line from Sijing to Songjiang. Before dawn this morning, a portion of the enemy troops advanced on Sijing from various routes from Qibao Town, where fierce fighting took place. Our troops have established close contact from Sijing to Songjiang. As of this afternoon, Songjiang remains firmly in our hands. As for the enemy troops at Tuanlai Temple, Jinshan, Quangong Pavilion, etc., although they have advanced towards Pinghu and Zhapu on both the north and west routes, attempting to seize these two key points to relieve the siege of Shihudang, our troops had already mobilized heavy forces to intercept them strictly. The enemy's conspiracy will definitely not succeed. According to official news, Pinghu and Zhapu were still secured by our troops as of this morning. In Nanshi, our troops are firmly defending the east bank of Rihui Port to South Huangpu. The enemy began artillery shelling from just after 6:00 AM, and at the same time dispatched large numbers of aircraft, in groups of three to five, to bomb in rotation. Our loyal and brave soldiers responded calmly and were not moved. At around 11:00 AM, the enemy artillery fire suddenly increased, firing densely. The sound of the shelling was like that of machine guns. At the same time, enemy bombing also became more intense. A portion of our fortifications was destroyed. At 11:30 AM, the enemy crossed the Rihui Bridge and a portion of the enemy troops managed to cross over. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting in the area south of Dapu Bridge. During the intense artillery fire, stray bullets landed in the French Concession along the border and in the refugee areas. As for Yongdong, our troops had already withdrawn. However, the enemy did not dare to land a force until this morning. Now, enemy flags are hung in various places along the Huangpu River. Pudong, the position we defended most strongly and where our troops put up the fiercest resistance, has finally fallen.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Fiercely Attack Nanshi, Forcibly Crossing Rihui Port This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft and Artillery Fiercely Bomb, Our Troops Respond Calmly; A Small Unit of Enemy Troops Forcibly Cross the Bridge, Intercepted and Attacked by Us; Enemy Forcibly Occupies the British Merchant Hongping Wharf, Surrounded by Us</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy and our forces are still facing each other across the water on both the east and west banks of Rihui Port and along the Huangpu River. At around 4:00 PM yesterday, enemy troops south of Fenglin Bridge began shelling Nanshi with field artillery. At the same time, enemy aircraft also appeared over the Huangpu River, continuously dropping large bombs and also pointing out targets for the enemy artillery. However, because the enemy's artillery fire was sparse, our defending troops did not pay attention. Seeing that our troops were calm and unmoved, the enemy, in the twilight, surrounded the west bank and attempted a stealthy crossing. At that time, our troops immediately swept the area with machine guns. The enemy, knowing they were prepared for, quickly fled back. Thus, intense firing erupted on both the east and west banks for a time. About an hour later, the firing gradually became sparser and eventually quieted down. After nightfall, neither side took action. However, the enemy occasionally fired one or two shots after long intervals, causing no damage to us. Just after 4:00 AM this morning, enemy troops attempted to move again, and the sound of gunfire resumed and gradually intensified. Enemy aircraft also took off at this time and dropped bombs back and forth. Our troops immediately returned fire and launched a counterattack. Rihui Port was immediately thrown into a state of tension.</p>
<h3>The Situation on Xujiahui Road is Tense</h3>
<p>From 6:00 AM This Morning, the Sound of Artillery Fire Continues Intermittently, Mixed with Sparse Rifle Fire; Around 9:00 AM, Reporters from This Newspaper Drove to Inspect the Area Where the Western District of the French Concession Borders the Chinese Territory; Rulin Road and Gaoen Road are Close to the Enemy's Rear; the Sound of Artillery Fire is Deafening; Four or Five Enemy Heavy Bombers Flew Over the French Concession; Some French Troops Nearby Fired Several Anti-Aircraft Rounds as a Warning; The Enemy Aircraft Flew to Our Military Position in the Eastern District of Rihui Port and Dropped Multiple Large Bombs; The Explosion Sound Was Very Loud; Fire Erupted Immediately at the Point of Impact; Black Smoke Billowed Straight Up, Clearly Visible on Fuli Street; Xujiahui Road Has Been Closed to Traffic Due to the Emergency Fire Zone; The Horizontal Roads Connected to Xujiahui Road, Such as Qiqi Road, Which Leads to Fenglin Bridge, and Jin Shenfu Road, Which Leads to Dapu Bridge, Have Been Blocked About 200 Meters from Xujiahui Road; The Southern End of Dapu Bridge is the Crossroads of Intense Fighting Between the Two Armies; The Chinese Territory in the South is Rihui Port; The Artillery Fire is Extremely Fierce; Black Smoke Fills the Air; Nearby Houses are Shaken; Residents Near the Southern End of Jin Shenfu Road, Which is Close to Dapu Bridge, are Fleeing in Panic; Stray Bullets are Numerous in the Xujiahui Road Area</p>
<h3>Aircraft and Artillery Bomb Nanshi</h3>
<p>The enemy is now deploying heavy artillery behind Zhaofeng Garden and in the Xuhui area, shelling southward. The enemy has densely deployed field artillery in Xujiahui, Longhua, and nearby Fenglin Bridge, concentrating firepower on our military position from three sides. At the same time, enemy aircraft are constantly flying back and forth, conducting reconnaissance and bombing in the air. Our troops are relying on the east bank of Rihui Port, holding firmly, and returning artillery fire to attack the enemy. From morning to noon, the artillery battle was fierce, and the sound of artillery fire was especially dense between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, mixed with the sound of machine guns and rifles. A small portion of our fortifications along Rihui Port was slightly damaged, but was immediately repaired. The soldiers were unharmed. The enemy is focusing on bombing with aircraft and artillery, and the infantry is not moving out, so there is no change in the position.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Forcibly Cross Rihui Port</h3>
<p>But at about 11:30 AM, under the cover of their aircraft and artillery, the enemy on the west bank of Rihui Port began to attack us, firing densely along the coast with machine guns. Our troops on the east bank immediately went out to meet the enemy, using small cannons, machine guns, and rifles to fire across the river. More than thirty enemy soldiers fell dead after being shot. Our side suffered no casualties. But the enemy continued to reinforce, making great sacrifices, and forcibly crossed the river towards Rihui Port. Our troops concentrated firepower and bombarded them fiercely. Countless enemy soldiers were killed. Eventually, due to the strong momentum, a small portion of the enemy troops were able to cross over. Our troops are still intercepting them tightly in nearby trenches and houses.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops on Huangpu River Attempt to Cross in Stealth, Fail</h3>
<p>Two enemy shallow-water gunboats, crossing the defense zone of foreign warships from Britain and France, arrived at the 16th Wharf in Nanshi and anchored outside our blockade line, tail east and head west, fiercely bombarding our Nanshi with artillery. After 10:00 AM today, the enemy attempted to cross our blockade line, attempting to land at the 16th Wharf. They dispatched a small yellow-smokestack steamer, fully loaded with more than a hundred Japanese soldiers carrying machine guns, etc. The boat stopped by our blockade line. The enemy soldiers in the boat, carrying weapons, climbed over the sunken ships that we had sunk to block the river. Under the cover of the enemy warships, they attempted to land. Our troops at that location were very strong. When the enemy soldiers landed, they opened fire and swept the area. Enemy soldiers fell dead one after another, and eventually failed to succeed.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Attack Enemy at Kailin Wharf</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Kailin Coal Mine Wharf, operated by a British merchant west of Rihui Port in Nanshi, was not equipped with defensive fortifications by us. The enemy ignored international integrity and forcibly occupied the wharf with more than eighty enemy soldiers at 1:00 AM this morning. For self-defense, we launched an attack and wounded more than ten enemy soldiers. The remaining enemy soldiers fled into the wharf building. Four or five of our soldiers were injured.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Firmly Defend Songjiang City</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Occurs Near Sijing, All Enemy Soldiers in Xincang Annihilated</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that our new defense line from the Suzhou River to the Huangpu River has been arranged according to plan, holding the Huangdu Town on the north bank of the Suzhou River and Songjiang on the north bank of the Huangpu River. The connecting point between them is Sijing Town, protruding eastward. The entire line is 32 kilometers long. The enemy's westward invasion has already resulted in fierce fighting near Sijing. Our position is stable, and Songjiang County is also firmly defended by our troops.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 10th: The enemy entrenched in Xincang Town has been completely annihilated after our encirclement and suppression on the 10th. We are searching and suppressing the enemy who landed along the coast of Hangzhou Bay. From 8:50 AM to 5:00 PM on the 10th, more than 20 enemy aircraft took turns harassing Zhejiang. Hangzhou issued air raid alerts four times, and Jiaxing was bombed seven times throughout the day, with more than 20 bombs dropped, and Hiashe was bombed twice, destroying several civilian houses.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Our Correspondent Attached to the Army Reported at 1:30 PM on the 11th: Fierce fighting broke out again near Shihudang at around 7:30 PM last night. The artillery fire was exceptionally fierce and did not stop all night, continuing until about 6:00 AM this morning. Enemy deaths and injuries have reached more than 500 people. We also have considerable sacrifices. However, the situation has become more certain.</p>
<h3>The Defense Line North of Guangfu Remains Unmoved</h3>
<p>Two Offensives Were Repelled by Our Troops</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Correspondent Attached to the Army Reported on the Morning of the 10th (Delayed): Our defense line north of Guangfu is unaffected by the changes in the defense line south of the Suzhou River. Starting yesterday, the enemy began a fierce attack on our entire line, firing more than a thousand artillery shells, as densely as machine guns. At the same time, several hundred enemy soldiers advanced towards our line at Wangjiazhai and Zhangjiacun southwest of Luodian. After our troops fought bravely, they finally defeated them. This morning, the enemy near Guangfu again carried out harassing fire on our position. Our troops calmly returned fire, and every bullet hit its mark. The enemy suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Lands in Pudong This Morning</h3>
<p>After Gathering at Lanningdu, They Flank Nanshi Across the River</p>
<p>The Pudong position was occupied by enemy troops who landed this morning at 7:00 AM. In this eastern front battlefield of the three-month war of resistance, which has been subjected to indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft and warships, our loyal and brave soldiers have not only shown no fear, but have also repeatedly demonstrated their power, dealing severe blows in dozens of battles, large and small. Until the enemy changed their plan and landed stealthily at Jinshanwei, the regular troops in Pudong began the strategic abandonment of the positions they occupied along the river on the evening of the 6th of this month, only sending 500 members of a certain unit from a certain place to assist the police and members of the defense corps to defend tenaciously. Therefore, for four consecutive days, enemy aircraft continued to conduct reconnaissance and bombing, and enemy warships also frequently fired artillery to prevent our side from attacking. It wasn't until about 9:00 PM last night that a small motorboat carrying more than a dozen soldiers was dispatched by an enemy warship docked on the Pudong side of the 16th Wharf to explore the Dongchang Road Wharf. At that time, the members of our unit had already received orders to retreat. Seeing no movement, the enemy soldiers crawled ashore, searched and advanced. Seeing that there were no soldiers on any road, they returned to the warship to report. This morning, at dawn, enemy soldiers landed in several directions, including the Qichang Pier, Taitong Pier, Cemetery Pier, Chunjiang Pier, Youlong Pier, and Dongchang Pier. By 7:00 AM, they had rushed to the south of Bailianjing Port. At this point, Pudong was completely lost to the enemy. When the enemy soldiers landed, the first step was to kill anyone who looked suspicious with a pistol. In front of the Xiaoyangjing Temple of the Police Bureau Road, corpses were lying everywhere, forming a temporary execution ground, with blood flowing all over the ground. And if those people's shooting skills were poor, several people were not hit in vital areas, and rolled around in the blood. Many innocent civilians were tied to utility poles and were about to be killed by the enemy. A member of the defense corps was captured by an enemy soldier. When the enemy soldier was about to capture a second person, the member of the defense corps took out a pistol from his bag and shot the enemy soldier to death and escaped. It can be said that he was lucky to have escaped from the tiger's mouth. Yangjing Town Street, which the enemy soldiers regarded as an ominous place, has been set on fire and completely destroyed. The Qichang Pier and Lujiazhai riverfront market houses were burned down to eliminate obstacles to the enemy warships' line of sight. Most of the traitors were active everywhere. If there was half a complaint, they would be shot and killed. After 9:00 AM, enemy soldiers guarded the Dongchang Pier, only allowing people returning from Puxi, not allowing people to cross the river. They forced men to become coolies, sending them to Lujia Ferry, Yangjia Ferry, Laobai Ferry, Zhangjiabang, Tangqiao, South Pier, Zhoujia Ferry, and the south bank of Huangpu to pile sandbags and carry guns, artillery, and ammunition. A large team of enemy soldiers had been sent to those ferries to attack Nanshi from both sides.</p>
<p>Laiyidu, Xinmalu, Lujiazui and other places in Pudong were stealthily landed by the enemy last night. The Japanese flag is now hoisted there. Local refugees are often shot by the enemy, and the elderly are the most severely affected. Also, an enemy gunboat that entered the Jin Liyuan Wharf in Nanshi yesterday afternoon retreated this morning at about 7:00 AM, and then fired artillery shells at Nanshi, totaling more than a dozen rounds. It then sailed back to its original location and docked, and then broke into our 16th Wharf blockade line, which was immediately repelled by our troops firing machine guns at the enemy boat. After the enemy troops invaded Pudong, they first set fire to the Jiangmao Pier, and the fire blazed into the sky. A part of the enemy forces went to Laiyi Ferry, and part to Dongchang Road. The enemy troops stopped the refugees fleeing from Pudong, only allowing vacant troops to cross the river. Most of the enemy troops who went to Pudong were puppet troops from the Eastern Provinces. At about 11:00 AM, the enemy troops hung a balloon in front of the consulate at the Baitou Bridge.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bomb Wuxi and Changzhou</h3>
<p>[Zhenjiang] At 9:30 AM on the 10th, six enemy heavy bombers and two reconnaissance planes flew to Wuxi in succession to bomb the factory area, dropping a total of more than 60 bombs. The Xinhong, Yuguang, Qinking, and Qinfeng factories were heavily bombed, and the damage is still being investigated. Enemy aircraft also flew to Qiyeyan in Changzhou, dropped several bombs, and then turned back, dropping many bombs over Jiangyin and Changshu before fleeing. Also, at 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM, more than ten enemy aircraft flew to the railway stations in Wuxi and Changzhou to drop bombs, and the damage is unknown. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Enemy aircraft again flew into Shandong Province on the 10th, wreaking havoc along the Jinpu Railway. Yucheng, Nanshahe, Qufu, Zou County, and other places were bombed. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>[Changzhou] At 8:00 AM on the 10th, two enemy aircraft attacked Changzhou, dropping two large bombs at the station, one on Shilu Road and one on the coal pile. At the same time, five enemy aircraft dropped five bombs west of Henglin Station, four in the fields and one next to the railway tracks. A train bound for Beijing happened to be there, and the train head was hit by the bomb, causing minor injuries and 13 deaths and injuries. The ironworks room of the Qiyeyan Machinery Factory was also hit by a bomb. Also, at 2:00 PM, six enemy aircraft dropped seven large bombs at the station, two bombs hit the Longtou room, damaging several locomotives, and the rest fell in the fields. They then flew to Qiyeyan Station and dropped two bombs, damaging a section of the platform and destroying three houses. They also dropped three bombs over Henglin, with no major damage.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Reiterates Determination to Resist to the End</h3>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty Conference Will Not Close Without Results, Representatives of Britain, the United States, and France Have Completely Consistent Views</p>
<p>Brussels: The Chinese delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference issued an official report last night, stating that it had received a declaration from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, explaining that the withdrawal of Chinese troops from the vicinity of the Public Concession in Shanghai was entirely due to tactical needs, the purpose of which was to prolong long-term resistance. Chiang Kai-shek continued that the Chinese government and the people of the whole country are determined to resist to the end. As long as the enemy is on Chinese territory, China will do its best to defend it. As long as Chinese sovereignty is threatened, there will be no peace between China and Japan. Under these circumstances, China is not only spiritually but also factually upholding the Nine-Power Treaty, and hopes that other signatory countries can do the same. The declaration concluded by stating that the determination of the entire Chinese nation to resist will enable the Nanjing government to hope that the situation in the Far East can be fairly and justly resolved. (National Telecommunications, 11th)</p>
<p>Brussels: According to informed sources, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will not close until concrete results are obtained. In this regard, the general public attaches great importance to the consultations held by British Foreign Secretary Eden, French Foreign Minister Talberg-Bos, and US Chief Representative Davis at the Capital Hotel at 6:00 PM today. In the evening, Eden hosted a banquet for representatives of the British Commonwealth according to custom, and invited Davis to participate. Many believe that this move indicates that the opinions of Britain and the United States are clearly converging. (National Telecommunications, 10th)</p>
<p>Brussels: Japanese sources here stated that the reports in the newspapers that Japan would abolish the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 are not true. The Japanese government has no such intention and has decided to uphold the principle of the Open Door under any circumstances. (National Telecommunications, 11th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Belgian Ambassador to Japan went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to ask when the Japanese government's reply to the application from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference could be expected. Vice Foreign Minister Horita replied that the Japanese government is currently drafting this reply, which can be submitted to the Cabinet for approval this Friday, and then immediately sent to the Belgian Ambassador for transmission to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference.

<h3>British, American, and French Representatives Discuss the Safety of the Concessions</h3>
<p>Japan Refuses to Participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Leaving No Doubt</p>
<p>Brussels: The chief representatives of Britain, the United States, and France at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Eden, Davis, and Talberg-Bos, held important talks last night to discuss the status of the Shanghai concessions and the protective measures that should be taken. It is heard that the three politicians all believed that there was little certainty regarding Tokyo's response to the application sent to the Nine-Power Conference a few days ago. Therefore, they will agree on recommendations so that they can be submitted as soon as Tokyo's reply is received, without wasting time. There is now little doubt that the Japanese government will frankly reject the application. The only decision that remains is whether the door to continued negotiations will still be open. The Japanese side said that it would not stop military action without complete victory, but China is also determined to continue the war and will not show weakness. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>[London] British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranbourne stated in the House of Commons today that after British Ambassador Hugh Knatchbull-Hugessen was attacked by a Japanese aircraft on the Beijing-Shanghai Road, although British officials had notified the Japanese authorities whenever possible when entering dangerous areas, the illegal damage caused by Japanese troops in China could not escape their responsibility even without such notification. Cranbourne also stated that there is no regulation requiring the Japanese military authorities to be notified of British people's travels by car in China. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>A Large Group of Students in Brussels Demonstrates at the Japanese Embassy</h3>
<p>Thousands of People Sign a Letter to the Japanese Ambassador, Protesting the Destruction of Our Cultural Institutions</p>
<p>Brussels: A large group of students demonstrated outside the Japanese Embassy here today, and many were arrested by the police, including the president of the Student Union and other officials. The students in Brussels originally planned to organize a parade to submit a protest signed by a thousand students to the Japanese Ambassador, opposing the systematic destruction of educational and cultural institutions by the Japanese army in China. The students then gathered at the police station to hold a demonstration, forcing the police to request military police to suppress them before dispersing the students. It is also heard that the Japanese Embassy issued a declaration regarding the students' protest, stating, "Japan has done its best in humanitarian and cultural work in China," and that the students' claims were "base and ridiculous," and that the Belgian students should be concerned with resolving the current disputes in Europe. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>There Are No Enemy Traces in Guanhaiwei</h3>
<p>Since the news of the enemy's landing at Guanhaiwei on the south bank of the Qiantang River spread, the Ningbo and Shaoxing natives in this port were immediately terrified. According to the telegram from the Sanbei Steamboat Company, the reported news is definitely untrue. Also, the passengers who arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo this morning, who passed through Cao'e to Ningbo yesterday, also said that it was not true. Central News Agency reported that there was also news that the enemy had landed at Guanhaiwei on the south bank of the Qiantang River the day before, and that a part of the enemy was advancing on Yuyao, but this has not been confirmed as there was no report from the military authorities.</p>

<p>Nine-Power Treaty Conference. I had long expected that it would have no effect. However, those who superstitiously believe in the "sacred theory of conferences" still thought that it would at least be of some use. And now, what is the result? Before the meeting opened, it welcomed the participation of the Soviet Union. Now that the Soviet Union has participated, they are afraid that it will not leave, so it is excluded from the mediation committee. It is right for Litvinov to leave in a huff. Observing what Litvinov came for, and what Litvinov left for, the drawbacks of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have already been fully exposed. What else is there to hope for?</p>

<h3>Foreign Eyewitnesses Talk About the Situation of Our Troops Withdrawing from Xuhui</h3>
<p>Four Thousand People Marched in Formation and Slowly Advanced Westward to Hongqiao, Presenting British Soldiers with Four Bottles of Wine and Shaking Hands as a Farewell</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that, according to foreign eyewitnesses, there was no chaos or disorder in the withdrawal of the Chinese troops from Xuhui. They organized and abandoned the defensive positions along the Suzhou River and west of the railway. This move showed the orders of the commander. It was on Tuesday night that the artillery roared and the bombs fell near the Hua Jun position near Jessfield Road. About four thousand people marched in formation and slowly advanced westward to Hongqiao, with few wounded soldiers among them. Since they moved to Xuhui to fight, they had been neighbors with the British soldiers. Now, moving to a new position, they still did not forget to sadly say goodbye to the British soldiers. A Chinese captain who had befriended a British officer sought him out and shook hands to say goodbye. Then, from under his coat, he took out four bottles of wine and presented them to the British officer, saying, "Please share them with your troops as a memorial to our friendship." The officers monitoring the withdrawal of the troops followed the ranks until all the soldiers had left to the west before following the ranks.</p>
<h3>Ten Thousand Yuan Loss for Shangsong</h3>
<p>According to Yin Shisheng, the manager of the Shangsong Motor Company, who came to Shanghai from Songjiang, after the enemy landed at Quan Gong Ting and other places in Jinshanwei, Songjiang became an important transportation hub between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the situation suddenly became tense. The enemy was exerting all its strength to attack the area, attempting to capture Songjiang in one fell swoop and threaten our Shanghai garrison. The enemy planes were especially cruel and violent. Currently, the Songjiang County and Public Security Bureau and other agencies have been bombed and destroyed. Part of the Commissioner's Office has also been destroyed. The number of civilian houses that have been destroyed is even more difficult to count. The company properties of the Shangsong Highway's head office at Maluqiao, and the Zhuangqiao Sheshan branch, were also bombed and destroyed by enemy aircraft one after another. Regarding company staff, ticket inspector Liu Bincheng and mechanic Zhang Shihe were injured in the bombing. Since August 13th, only three or four of the company's military vehicles and passenger cars have been traveling between Shangsong. Since the enemy invaded Songjiang, all operations have been completely suspended. The company's total loss is estimated to be more than 100,000 yuan. When I (Manager Yin speaking of himself) left Songjiang the night before last, enemy traces had been discovered in the eastern and southern gate areas. However, our army had elite troops stationed there, and their morale was unusually high, and they were engaged in active counterattacks. Currently, there are very few civilians residing in Songjiang city. Apart from some who have come to Shanghai, the majority are helping the elderly and children and fleeing to the neighboring villages to the west.</p>

The French Concession authorities, considering that the southern part of Xujiahui Road borders the Huajie Xietu Road, have constructed a wall from Xieqiao in the east, westward to Beile Road. Further west, it extends directly to Xujiahui, separated by a creek. Now, because the war has shifted to the western and southern parts of Shanghai, there are fears that the peace and order within the concession will be affected. Therefore, starting yesterday morning, martial law has been declared in the Xujiahui Road area, prohibiting the passage of vehicles and people. French, Russian, and Vietnamese police officers have been dispatched to patrol the area.</p>
<h3>Bombing Situation in Shanghai County</h3>
<p>Warehouses Completely Destroyed, Refugees Eagerly Awaiting Relief</p>
<p>In recent days, various villages and towns under the jurisdiction of Shangsong County have been repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft, and many civilians have been killed or injured by machine-gun fire. The exact number is difficult to count. On the 6th and 8th, the area along the Shangsong Motor Road was bombed all day long. At 4:00 PM on the 8th, two enemy planes bombed the area between Beiqiao and Maqiao on the Shangsong Road, dropping seven or eight bombs in total. Two bombs landed on Maqiao, and four bombs landed on Yantang. Part of the Jiangsu Provincial Yantang People's Education Center Cooperative Hall was destroyed, and the cooperative's warehouse was completely destroyed. More than 4,500 bales of cotton and other goods stored inside were completely lost, totaling about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. At that time, the Yantang People's Education Center was in the process of relocating women and children, and was also subjected to enemy machine-gun fire, resulting in the death of one child. It has been investigated that the county is located east of Songjiang, north of Fengxian, and south of Qibao. Regular transportation has long been cut off. Because the matter occurred so suddenly, many local people remained in their homes, and are eagerly awaiting relief. According to people who walked to Shanghai on the 9th, several bridges on the Hu-Min Road have been bombed and destroyed. Along the way, there are many bombed-out cars and dead and injured civilians, which is a very tragic sight.</p>
<h3>Foreign Nationals and Officials Celebrate Peace Memorial</h3>
<p>Today is the European Peace Memorial Day, also known as Thanksgiving Day. The consulates and military personnel of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and other countries stationed in Shanghai held a celebration and wreath-laying ceremony in front of the Goddess of Peace on the Bund in the French Concession at 9:00 AM. Warships of various countries stationed in the Huangpu River in Shanghai and the consulates and public institutions of various countries stationed in Shanghai all flew flags in celebration. Various foreign charitable organizations also sent young women to sell red paper flowers on the streets to commemorate the occasion and to use the proceeds from the donations to comfort disabled veterans and support charitable causes.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Management Committee Regulates Shanghai's Vegetable Supply</h3>
<p>Supply Decreases, Prices Soar by Half; Efforts are Underway to Stabilize Prices and Prevent Shortages</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Produce Trade Association, in order to meet the needs of wartime society, regulate civilian food supplies, and protect the interests of farmers in the rear, has established a Transportation and Management Committee for Vegetables and Local Produce to handle the transportation of inland vegetables and local produce to Shanghai. Since the Suzhou Creek area west of Shanghai fell into the war zone, the committee has sought to change the route to Shanghai. Now, because Nanshi and other places have successively become war zones, vegetables from the inland areas cannot be transported to Shanghai. Vegetable vendors in various small markets have reduced their supply, and prices have soared, increasing by 50% compared to normal times. The committee is currently trying to ensure that Shanghai's food supply is not affected by shortages.</p>
<h3>Today is the Italian Emperor's Birthday; Officials and Nationals Stationed in Shanghai Celebrate</h3>
<p>Today is the birthday of the Italian Emperor. The Italian Consulate General in Shanghai is closed for celebrations. At 10:00 AM, the Italian Defense Forces held a review in the barracks. Italian Ambassador Cola and Consul General Nilo, stationed in Shanghai, attended. In the afternoon at 6:00 PM, the ambassador hosted representatives stationed in Shanghai. In the evening, Consul General Nilo, Italian warship Captain Sala, and others held a tea party at the Italian General Association to celebrate.</p>
<h3>Relief for Refugees</h3>
<p>Organized by the Relief Association, Concert to Raise Funds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee, in conjunction with the Shanghai music community, is organizing a concert to raise funds for refugees. The Lido Grand Theater has generously agreed to provide the venue free of charge, and the concert will be held on the 20th. It is reported that those who have been invited to participate include Xia Guoqiong, Si Yegui, Ding Shande, Tan Xiaolin, Wei Shenle, Dai Cuilun, Zhang Rongzhen, Cai Shao Xu, Chen Yuxin, Ge Jingxian, and other well-known musical groups and music schools. The program is rich and varied, and all ticket proceeds will be used for refugee relief.</p>
<h3>Various Charitable Organizations Rescue Refugees from Danger</h3>
<p>Since our army retreated to the new defensive positions, the residents of the western districts of Shanghai and the Xujiahui Shishanwan area have lost their support and have moved to safer areas. Except for a portion of young and strong people who have escaped to the border between the Chinese and foreign concessions, where they have been distributed to refugee camps by various charitable organizations, there are still a large number of women and children gathered there awaiting rescue. Upon hearing the news, charitable organizations immediately dispatched a large number of trucks and ambulances to risk going to rescue them. As of noon today, more than 4,000 refugees have been rescued. The rescue efforts will continue this afternoon, but there is a shortage of vehicles, and the number of refugees is large. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will lend or donate vehicles.</p>
<h3>Italian Military Commander Donates Bread to Relieve Refugees</h3>
<p>Today is the Italian Emperor's birthday. The Italian military commander stationed in Shanghai, accompanied by several adjutants, brought a large quantity of bread and canned food to the refugee reception center of the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Relief Committee to distribute to the refugees. The chairman of the committee, Qu Wenliu, and the director of the negotiation section, Yu Xiangqin, accompanied and entertained them, expressing deep gratitude for the friendly spirit of the Italian people.</p>
<h3>Suspect Arrested in Bathtub Corpse Case</h3>
<p>Huang Kejia's Handwriting Quite Similar to the Deceased's Note</p>
<p>Shen Yuzhen, the wife of Huang Weiyuan, the owner of the American Raisin Company, located at No. 13, Lane 296, Gongguan Road, French Concession, was murdered on the 3rd of this month in Room 201 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road. Details have been reported in this newspaper. After investigation by Chief Detective Zhang Yuanqing of the Laozha Police Station, who is handling the case, it was discovered that a note left by the deceased in the room appeared to be in the handwriting of Huang Kejia (31 years old), a Jia Ding native who was a former runner for the American Company. It was also learned that he lived at No. 137, Willmont Road, so he was summoned to the police station. After comparing the handwriting, there were many similarities, so he was detained and sent to the First Special Court this morning. The police station lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the case still required detailed investigation, so he requested that Huang Kejia be temporarily detained. After interrogation by Judge Feng Shide, it was approved to detain him for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Cultivate Our Powerful Anti-Japanese War Team</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mingshi</p>
<p>It was probably about a week ago? I received a letter from Mr. Guo Woli, in which he gave us many insightful opinions. In addition to sincerely admiring and accepting them, there are two points that I must mention: ㊀ To give a brief report on the environment in which we are located. ㊁ To make an external request within the scope of possibility to realize our ideals. But I am ashamed to say that, in recent days, the editor has been immersed in the busy atmosphere of organizing manuscripts for the "Shanghai Boy Scouts" monthly magazine and "Wartime Scouts" manuscripts, coupled with being driven by the work of personal life issues. Therefore, it has been delayed again and again until today. Now it cannot be delayed any longer, so I am taking some time out of this busyness to fulfill this long-held wish.</p>
<p>Mr. Guo raised the issue of the length of this column. His meaning is, "I am willing to contribute my meager efforts to support this field of wartime youth, but I hope that the length can be expanded even more!" Regarding this point, I must give a brief report to Mr. Guo and other "wartime youth" lovers who have the same intention as Mr. Guo.</p>
<p>When we started contacting various parties about the "wartime youth publication issue," we almost received the same answer, which was: "During this period of resistance against Japan, the source of newspapers is not smooth, and it is almost entirely supported by inventory. Therefore, we have to reduce the length to seek sustainability. Under this current situation, when news is crowded, advertisements are often removed. It can be seen that the position is so constrained that it has reached its limit. Although assisting anti-Japanese war propaganda is the due duty of the newspaper, we are more than willing but lack the ability, and we can only sigh helplessly!" After hearing these remarks, although we have the heart to serve the country, we cannot force others to do what they cannot do, especially since this kind of answer is really someone else's frustration, so it is certainly not good to discuss it again.</p>
<p>Finally, after many efforts, we were fortunate enough to be granted a daily allocation of one to two thousand words by the Shenbao Museum for the publication of this column. However, when manuscripts are crowded, it still has to be reduced accordingly. After several discussions, it was decided to start publishing from October 1st. But then things changed again, that is, the Shenbao side felt that the length was insufficient, and in fact could not be published every day. If it must be published every day, then it would be easier to change it to the evening newspaper. Therefore, from the 2nd, it was changed to be published in the Shenbao Evening Newspaper.</p>
<p>Of course, we also want to expand the length so that we can enrich the content and strengthen the power of publicity, which would be of great help to the future of the anti-Japanese war. But judging from the process of contacting the publication, it may be a very difficult problem? But of course, we still have to discuss with the newspaper to give us some help in order to satisfy the hopes of us and the lovers. I think unless there is really no way, the newspaper will definitely be willing to support it!</p>
<p>Mr. Guo also raised the issue of the content of this column. His meaning is; "Try to collect as much material as possible that young people need, so as to cultivate our powerful anti-Japanese war vanguard." This must be discussed from two aspects. The first is the "need problem." What is the need of young people? Of course, we cannot arbitrarily determine it with subjective intentions, and the actual needs of each person are not necessarily the same. Therefore, the best way is to solicit opinions from outside, asking the youth community to tell us what each person needs. After we receive these reports, we can classify and organize them, and gradually introduce those needed materials according to the urgency of the need. Otherwise, many of the materials we introduce may not be what most young people need; on the other hand, the materials that young people urgently need may not be introduced by us. Wouldn't that be too uneconomical? The second is the "talent problem." The mission of our group is indeed broad, and the work we undertake is indeed heavy, such as the tasks of guarding, carrying stretchers, first aid, nursing, comforting, and recruiting at the rear wounded soldiers' hospitals; and the tasks of guarding, maintaining order, receiving, sending, and recruiting clothes at the refugee camps. At the front, we are responsible for first aid, transportation, traffic, intelligence, documentation, and liaison. There are also the autumn order maintenance of various temporary salvation groups' meetings, etc., and our members and staff are needed to participate in these activities. Therefore, we have almost directed all our strength towards this. The talents in all aspects of publicity are of course not very strong, especially in the editorial aspect, only one or two people are responsible, but the undertakings that are managed include three periodicals, "Shanghai Boy Scouts" monthly magazine, "Wartime Scouts" and "Wartime Youth", as well as "Wartime Wall Books" irregular publications and soliciting contributions from various publishing circles. You think it is exhausting one or two people to cope with such complexity. How can one not feel the weakness of power, not to mention the occupational work that is generated to maintain personal life, and one must devote some strength to handle it. Isn't this busy on top of busy? If we take a step back, even if we don't feel busy, may I ask whether the talent of one or two people can meet the needs of the youth community? For the above urgent needs, we have to seek assistance from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Now, in addition to internal staff, I would like to solicit long-term voluntary special commentators from outside, who will provide some works on a regular basis. When encountering special problems, designate several people to discuss solutions. In this way, the materials needed by the youth community will not be difficult to gradually supply. What do you think of this, Mr. Guo?</p>
<p>Finally, I hope Mr. Guo will tell me your address so that I can visit or correspond with you. At the same time, I hope that those who agree with the above two methods will write directly to let us know, so as to facilitate the progress!</p>
