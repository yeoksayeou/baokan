<h3>大雨中殺敵如麻我軍克復羅店鎭</h3>
<p>並乘勝向東挺進追擊　南北兩陣地亦有劇戰</p>
<p>目前戰事之重心、集中於羅店方面、敵集精銳部隊及機械部隊六千人、於十三日晨在大砲及飛機掩謢之下、分向淑里橋北朱店等三路向我羅店之正面掹攻、我軍奮勇迎擊、激戰達三十小時以上、卒於十四日被敵軍一部進入羅店鎭內、縱火焚燒、我軍以火勢掹烈、常卽退出鎭外、堅守西郊預定之陳綫、迄至前日（十五）傍晚、我軍得到後方部隊之增援、乃卽猛力反攻、始則以來復槍及機關槍密集射擊、繼則以手溜彈向敵襲擊、最後紛上刺刀、掹烈衝鋒、卽在大雨之下、與敵肉搏於泥濘之中我軍兵士忠勇萬分、殺敵如麻、敵軍狼狽潰退、屍橫遍地、生還無幾、我軍卽克復羅店鎭、並乘勝向東挺進追擊、敵亟亟增援、企圖反攻、但我軍力雄厚、敵難得逞刻尙在激戰中、至於羅店南北兩面之陣地、亦有劇戰、茲分誌其戰况如下、</p>
<p>羅店之南敵軍來犯</p>
<p>羅店鎭南我軍、據守南郊、及顧家閣南北塘口等要隘、築有堅固工事、以防敵軍左翼之進犯、十五日晨敵果不斷以砲火集中轟擊、獲步兵、猛烈進犯、我軍堅忍應戰、雖在密集火綫下、氣不稍餒、安伏壕內、沉着應付、激戰至午、敵無𨻶可乘、且以天雨道路濘滑、坦克車等不能活動、敵如失重心、始終逗留於我陣地之前、踟蹰不敢進犯、經我後方砲兵陣地、掹烈轟擊、敵死傷甚衆、毫無結果、向後退却、</p>

<p>大美晚報紀述戰績</p>
<p>本市英文大美晚報十六日晚、在封面版以極顯著地位、刋載我軍克復羅店鎭消息、並冠以大號標題、標明“浦東華軍待機襲擊、羅店鎭克復證實”等字樣、茲將該報所載消息迻譯於後、“日本以其主力部隊、現正沿瀏河至閘北陣綫、與華軍相持中、另方面則企圖在浦東登陸、藉以在後方牽制華軍、惟浦東華軍兵力已配備就緒、陣綫異常鞏固、至於該方面華軍軍力如何配備、中國軍事當局則保持緘默、今（十六日）晨有日轟炸機四架、在浦東上空出現、至楊家渡投彈四枚、華方除民房數間被毀外、未受損失、今晨官方及獨立方面、均已證實華軍於十五日午夜在大雨滂沱中克復羅店之消息、十五日晚、有新聞記者一人、隨華軍開入羅店鎭、今午自前方歸來、報告日軍慘敗情形、據云日方所受損失、殊爲重大、華軍於夜色朦朧中、自東郊反攻、卽將日軍驅入羅店鎭內、雙方卽在該處發生激戰、日軍卒不支向東北郊潰退、永安橋十五日晚亦有激戰、日陸軍在大砲及機械化部隊掩護之下、向華軍大舉進攻華軍沉着應戰、日軍終被擊退、十六日晨拂曉、華軍在該處之陣地、毫無變動、</p>
<h3>敵猛攻永安橋無效</h3>
<p>在過去二十四小時之間、敵軍曾以重大之兵力、向我永安橋陣地數度猛烈進攻、希冀突破此綫、以達壓迫劉行、但我軍配備雄厚、待敵進犯、立予重創、而我後方砲火、尤予敵軍以莫大威脅、連日來敵軍傷亡慘重、終未得寸進、我軍以戰略關係、未予追擊、仍固陣以待、</p>
<p>楊行方面敵軍砲隊、於十五日晨五時許、向我永安橋南北陣地、猛力轟擊、希圖破壞我軍陣地、藉以阻擾我軍搆築工事、直至下午七時止、仍不斷射擊、我□□方面炮隊、亦集中火力、聯績還擊</p>
<h3>敵今晨砲轟我陣地</h3>
<p>昨晚十一時四十五分許、敵軍數百名、由北四川路分向虬江路及橫浜橋左近廣東街方面我軍陣地突襲、當時敵先以疏落步槍子彈向我陣地遙射、以探我方動靜但我守軍沉着鎭靜置之不睬、於是敵卽以大部隊向上述兩地進襲、我哨兵見其將近、一聲呼應、後備齊出、紛以機關槍手溜彈向敵擲射、將當前敵兵胥行擊倒、敵恐不支、亟調後援集力向我猛攻、我軍遂亦躍出戰壕、寗勇挺進、與敵肉搏、大領神威、戰至今晨一時十分左右、將敵擊退、敵以傷亡過半、憤無可洩、遂於一時許、指揮其配備於百老匯路以迄提籃橋間之陸戰砲十門、向浦東及江灣閘北一帶作漫無標的之射擊、總計每兩秒鐘一發、直至今晨二時因我軍始終置之不理、方覺乏味而自停、惟炮聲之密、驚醒睡夢不少、</p>
<h3>敵犯劉行被我擊退</h3>
<p>劉行方面、蘭晚八時會有一度激戰地點在劉行之北三里許、有敵約一營、施行夜襲、初時絕無聲息、暗中摸索而來、迫近我陣地時、爲我前哨發覺、開槍射擊、敵乃臥倒停進、我駐軍立卽開放排槍機槍、並齊上刺刀、準備厮殺、敵知有備、不敢再進、以迫擊砲還擊、支持約半小時、我軍躍出壕溝、由中路猛衝、左右兩翼亦迅速趕上、取包圍形勢、敵乃飛奔後退、追至三四百米達處、有敵一連、被我團團圍住、不及兎脫餘則遠颺、我某連長喊令繳械、敵頑强不服、乃以機槍掃射、未幾卽全部殲滅、步槍百餘枝、輕機槍五架、悉數奪獲、此役我完全勝利、始從容退歸、至今晨至、敵不敢再擾、</p>
<h3>侯家木橋我仍固守</h3>
<p>在廟行東北數里之侯家木橋、我軍所守陳地、自戰事爆發迄今、均屹然未動、以前曾憑藉此一據點、一度衝至黃浦江邊、惜以不勝敵人飛機大砲之壓迫、故功敗垂成、復退守原地、現我大部主要陣綫、雖移至第一道防綫、但侯家木橋陣地、以形勢極關重要仍在堅强固守中、自敵軍大言不慚官示本月十五目以前攻至南翔之命令後、該地自十日起、直至昨夜止、敵均傾力來犯、砲火迄未稍息、該地河道灣曲、陣綫紆迴、敵我軍隔河相向、逼近處笑語可聞、遠隔處亦不過數十米達而已、但以兩地陣綫相較、敵軍所受側射較大、故損失亦多、前夜敵軍偷渡江灣、被我俘虜十五人、內僅二日人、餘均爲我東北同胞、迫前來者、謂早有反戈之意、但無機會云云、當將其妥送後方、以示優待、</p>
<h3>蕰藻浜北我軍退敵</h3>
<p>蕰藻浜北岸、前（十五日）發見敵軍步騎聯合之部隊、配以迫擊砲兩門、在廟基附近活動、並沿浜構築工事、經我哨兵以步槍瞄凖射擊、敵應聲而倒、餘衆見我有備、卽退入附近村內、</p>

<h3>我軍事發言人駁斥日方荒誕讕言</h3>
<p>竟謂我浦東之砲兵　曾轟擊日方救護船</p>
<p>我軍事發言人談、日方又散播其荒誕之讕言、竟謂我浦東方面之砲兵、曾轟擊日方之救護船、此實爲世間最愚蠢之謡言、現在所必須聲明者、即爲日方之救護船、常緊靠於日艦之旁、實不知其用意之何在、我人絶未聞及日方任何救護船之曾被砲擊、雖業經確切證明華人及教會所設立之醫院、即如紅十字會之救護人員、屢遭日軍之攻擊、日方雖國掩飾其攻擊非戰鬥員之罪惡、然其不顧人道與正義之暴行、已深印於歷史上矣、</p>

<p>［紐約］紐約世界電聞報今日社論謂、美總統並未對中日兩國、引用中立法、其所宣佈之禁令、不過阻止美政府所有船隻裝運戰品前往遠東耳、中日兩國皆未正式宣戰、故羅斯福總統欲避免發生一種事變、致將美國牽入戰爭漩渦之可能性、美國大多數人民所欲美總統採取者、亦卽此種態度云、（中央社十五日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統今日仍以全力注意、中日戰事、同時商務部長、盧伯表示、政府所有之船隻或有被禁以棉花及廢鐵運往遠東交戰國家之可能、盧氏謂本年前七個月中、日本共購美棉一九二·○五○·○○○元、較之去年增加八七·○○○·○○○元、中國共購三六·九五五·○○○元、亦增一一·○○元、此種情形當然或因工業上之正當需要突然增加、故美國對於此等普通商品、欲研究其是否作為戰爭原料之用、亦須考慮各方面之關係、政府固願增加對外貿易、然亦不願美國商人但顧營利、而使國家牽入他國之爭端云（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］海軍部長史璜生今日宣布、美國海軍兩月以來、已禁止海軍廢鐵及廢銅出口、近來經濟學家及軍事家多批評廢鐵廢銅之出口驟增、咸以為此係他國軍火製造廠所購、最多者為德日意英四國、此種情形、對於美國及世界和平皆有危險、故海軍部有禁止出口之舉、至於此項禁令、是否將普遍實施、則海長不願表示、論者以為海軍部之禁止廢鐵廢銅出口、與羅斯福總統之禁止軍火出口、雖均僅以直屬政府之範圍為限、然亦顧欲一般商界取法云、（十五日國民電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>全面抗戰的再認識</h3>
<p>— 郭沫若</p>
<p>關於全面抗戰。一般人的解释。似乎是專門注重在戰域廣泛的一點。</p>
<p>這次的戰爭本發動在華北。但是。我們對於日本的抗戰却不局限於華北。我們在上海也和日本抗戰了起來。其它沿江沿海。凡有日本飛機來襲擊的地方。我們的空軍都一律地向他抗戰。像這樣，在目前雖然名義上並沒有下總動員令。而事實上是已經發動了全國一致的作戰過程。這個現象。似乎也就是一般人所了解的全面抗戰了。這不用說是全面抗戰的一面，而且是最為醒目的一面。然而這並不是全面抗戰的全部。</p>
<p>一般人說到戰爭便把它局限到軍事的作戰上去。這已經是不正確的一種見解。戰爭本身是有進化的。就單就軍事上的作戰說。有古時的單人獨馬。一刀一槍的平面戰爭。有現代的機械化。化學化。海陸空軍大集團的立體戰爭。戰爭的規模和形式。其進化是很可以驚人的。這種現代的立體戰爭已經不是單獨的軍事上的事體。這兒是把全國的力量集中了起來。全國的學術。產業。政治。經濟。敎育。訓練等等。在平時都要有充分的素養。而且是有系統有計劃的素養，然後才能結晶成為現代的立體戰爭。譬如我們的科學和工業如不發達。我們不能夠製造多量的戰車和坦克車。不能夠製造多量的軍用氣體。我們的部隊便無從機械化起。無從化學化起。這事實在我們目前是存在着的。我們中國因為產業落後。文化落後。因此在作現代的立體戰上我們便感受着沒大的缺陷，我們的部隊不僅還沒有機械化。化學化。連我們的海軍都還沒有建立。我們的空軍也太不充分。假使在這次的抗戰上。我們有得更多的飛機，有得若干的潛航艇。我們的戰爭一定更有可觀。那是毫無可疑的事。</p>
<p>眞實的全面抗戰應該是國家社會內的一切施設的戰時機構化。所謂戰時的經濟。戰時的財政。戰時的敎育。戰時的社會問題等等。那些問題都有專家在那兒規劃。而且有一部分已由我們的政府和社團次第施行着了。這規劃愈完密。施行愈迅速。我們的全面抗戰的威力便愈宏大。關於這些問題的規劃和施行。但可惜的是。那周密的程度和迅速的程度，於目前的軍事作戰的過程。可以說完全不能相應。這層在我們看來，覺得是一種危險的徵候，平時我們的一切規劃和施設已經是落後了的。到戰時的現在。如還要落後於人。那我們在抗戰上是要增加很大的困難的。</p>
<p>現在且舉出幾個事例來證明。</p>
<p>譬如上海紗廠的向内地移動吧。這是自戰事發動以來早已喧傳着的問題。政府也已有一定的規定來獎勵遷徙。然而直到現在大家都還在觀望。這紗廠移動不僅是於國家有利的重要的國策。就於經營產業的個人也是有絕對的利益的。上海在目前的狀態之下。無論怎樣是不能夠繼續營業。即使上海在短時期之內得以恢復和平（這是斷斷乎沒有的事。）然而日本人的侵略是沒有止境的。隔了若干時。必然地又會有同樣的戰事發生。上海已被證明為不是國家產業可以安置的地方了。而且這次淞滬抗戰的結果。日本紗廠被毁滅到了三分之二以上。這正給我們的綿紗業以擴張的機會。聰明的產業家是應該見到這些。自動地把產業向內地移。用不着還要等待政府來鞭策獎勵的。然而大家經了鞭策獎勵郤依然在心存觀望。不肯移動。因此失業的工人便多多淪落為難民。其有不能逃出戰區的。為生活所迫也就不能不被敵人利誘而為不利於國家民族的漢奸。這種遊移的態度。對於國家實在是人財兩失。</p>
<p>最近我們見到報上載着。就是今年的棉絮豐收。前幾天我到浦東去過兩次。看見沿途的農民正在採集棉花。大家都辛辛苦苦地採集大包小袋的。的確也呈着豐收的景象。這在平時本是應該慶賀的事件。然而在目前的戰時郤是値得我們深深考慮的一件。平時浙江一帶的棉花。大抵是為上海的日本紗廠所收買的。今年抗戰的結果。日本紗廠旣被毁滅。棉花的出路便不能不成為問題。因而種植棉花的江浙一帶的農民生活也就不能不成為問題。這一大批農民如一失掉生活。勢必又成為難民。而其一部分人只以為戰爭的結果是使他們失掉生活。勢必又淪為漢奸。為敵人所利用。我想在這時候政府為百般的政務和戰事正忙個不了。有些事體實在兼顧不來。應該要由我們聰明的愛國的資產家來負担起責任。譬如不要把自己的資本窩藏起來。多多拿些來收買棉花。解救農民的生活。迅速把工廠內移。迅速開工。使失業工人復業。這是對於自己的產業有利益的事業。然而已經就在遂行着最高的國策了。</p>
<p>以上所說是戰時的產業計畫推動得很迂緩的事實。此外如戰時的外交計畫也推動得同樣迂緩。我的在這次的抗戰上多多需要國際友人的帮助是明如觀火的事。我們的外交官吏十分努力。在國際關係上誠然是已經獲得了相當的成功。然而全靠正式的外交。這力量是還不夠的。因此在一月以前早就有發動國民外交的計畫提供了出來，希望多多選擇於國際有聲望的文化人作為國民代表派遣歐美，以發動英法美等國的民間力量。使他們了解我們抗戰的意義。並給我們以精神上的和物質上的資助，這實在是有絕對的必要。例如化些國家的資本家在抗戰期間借款。或拍賣大批軍火給我們的敵人。這在我們沒有宣戰的抗戰上。正式的外交是沒法阻止的。但如我們發動了國民外交。在各該國的內部得到了民衆的同情。資本家們的利慾心至少會稍稍收斂一下。那種消極的結果於我們已經是沒大的得益了。如有積極的結果能和各個愛好和平。尊重文化的國家成立互助公約。那對於國家的利益更是不可計量。然而發動國民外交的動議已經有了一個月。而其實現郤渺無影響，倒是據報章所載。日本人的國民外交反比我們先發動了起來。連人選都已經决定了。像這樣在戰時的規畫上我們又落人後。我們要望抗戰持久。並望抗戰必勝。那是有點南轅而北轍的。</p>
<p>總之。所謂全面抗戰的意義是值得我們再加認識，而我們所希望的。尤其是民間的有力者該把這個問題的解答。嚴肅地執行起來。有好些事件應該不必一定要等待政府去措辦的。更有好些事體、經措辦。不僅於國家有益。而且同時更於個人有益。希望大家於保衛國族的神聖誓約之前。擔當起執行全面抗戰的實際。（九月十五日）</p>

<p>— 相</p>
<p>此次我國與敵全面抗戰。不僅爲中華民族而戰。亦爲人類正義而戰。故無論民族之曾被其蹂躪與未經蹂躪。苟其反對。　武主義者。均應一致起來與正義的大敵戰。尤其是朝鮮。台灣。琉球。的被壓迫同胞。亟應起而謀獨立與解放。　矣。并且日本國内反戰運動。亦非常熱烈。因此有許多工人。焚燒其製油所。火藥廠。下級軍官有散布流言之重大事件。又有某某大將被暗殺。雖陸軍當局不肯公布其原因。而亦已承認其被刺。故此輩工人。下級軍官。與某某大將。這眞正可稱爲民族的英雄。值得我們崇拜。務望此種民族英雄。再接再厲。非消滅此人類正義的大仇敵不可。</p>

<h3>沉痛的回憶（五）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>㊄漢奸的各種類型</p>
<p>像一片最完備的，具有各色各樣的百貨商店一般，在現在的華北，幾乎世界上所有的漢奸類型，是全都具有着。我們的華北，其所以是那麽適宜於漢奸繁殖的緣由，追籌起來，我們覺得是非常難受和懊喪的，第一，透露了我們一部份民族道德的淪亡，第二，顯示了我們國民教育的失敗；第三，全體愛國民眾，不能自動起來，給漢奸以制裁，是漢奸們逍遙自在的最大的原因；第四，政府沒有整個辦法對付敵人的，是製造漢奸最好的機會。至於敵人方面的陰謀鬼計，替我們製造漢奸，那是必然的事，用不着驚異。——像這類卑鄙的，亡人國家的鬼計，不正是日本人的拿手好戲麼？</p>
<p>平津淪陷這件事，使華北鳥煙瘴氣的局面揭開了；所有的漢奸，準漢奸的面目，是完全顯露出來，和非漢奸的人們，分別得非常淸楚。因此，可也有好的作用：有反正可能的，趁機反正了：卻又有壞的作用：有漢奸傾向的，急轉直下地促成了。</p>
<p>“漢奸”這個名詞，椅來常常被人濫用。在這裹，記者是十二分地謹愼，盡可能地，把那些略有可以原諒之處的人們，全不歸人這裹面去；但同時也感到個人能力的薄弱，沒有法子，使所有各色各樣的漢奸類型，全都留下他們的形𧰼。</p>
<p>第一類，這是最無恥的一類。明知道自己是在當漢奸了，而反窮凶極惡地做下去，甚至公然宣稱：這正是自己願意走的，意識着走的道路。這類裹，最典型的，是平津淪陷後，出任北平市偽警察局長的潘吠桂。這潘某，是一九三一年天津暴動的暴徒的頭目。冀察局面特殊化以後，他是冀察政權的一位要人，是去年春天突起的所謂“新親日派”的主角。因為近年來，很替敵人立了些功績的緣故，所以，北平陷落的第一天，他就跨上了偽警察局長的坐位。壯職叫事時，召集所有的屬員，訓話道：一我們現在是當亡國奴了。那末，願意當的，留這兒；不願意的，請自便。過了兩天，在招待新聞界的席上，更進一步地說：一本人二十多年來，志願一向是這樣。這回出來，並不是为的做官，而是為的實行志願。有人說我這樣就是當漢奸，當賣國賊麼；那末，我就是漢奸，就是賣國賊能。顯然的，他是知道州漢奸，“賣國賊”是應當怎麼做法的，因為，地接着就又拿行動證實了：第步，出佈吿向人民說，“友邦”軍人是最講信義，最文明的，大家可以各安生業，用不着庸人自擾；同時又警吿着，萬一要略有不妥麼，那末，“友邦”軍人也是晟嚴厲的，闖出禍來，那可就咎由自取了。第斗步，日軍進城的時袱，他就立刻下了命令，把所有警察和保安隊的槍械五六千枝，一齊收繳起來，理由是：一則，治安有“友邦軍人共同維持，用不着帶武器了：冉則是佩帶武器，恐與“友邦”軍人發生誤會。這批槍械，據我們得到消息，已有一大半被日軍拿去了；但潘某卻對新聞界說，是“暫時存在庫裹”。八月八日，日軍進了城。這時，他的第三步工作，就是先來嚴密地檢查戶口和書店，並沒收無搏m收音機，藉以完全封鎖消息，其理由是與其等“友邦”軍人來動手，不如自動效勞。像這種種舉措，於事先，就體會了敵人的意旨，去曲意逢迎，眞可以說是得了作漢奸法內三昧。甚凶惡，皎之敵人尤過的。屬於這一類的人物，還有陳覺生，張允榮，張璧，等等。</p>
<p>第二類的漢奸裹，大槪張自忠是最確當代表，這類的漢奸，大約以武人和頭腦簡單的為多，漢奸的行動，他們是做的；然而，掛在嘴上的卻是：一什麼漢奸不漢奸，大家一樣為的撈子兒（即錢的意思）。你說我麼，我還說你是漢奸哩”！在嚴溝倫事件後的兩天，北平方面有軍事會議，在席上，馮治安當面責問張自忠：“去年春天，你打×××耳光，為他賣國賊；現在，你自己怎樣了？張自忠的回答是：好，你們全有地盤，有子兒，敢情會說風涼話；我呢，一打起來，天津玩完兒，我一個子兒撈不着！“像這一類的漢奸，完全是敵人用金錢地位，女色和其他種種，加以誘惑的。不過，他們有一個特色，就是：絕不肯承認自己在當“漢奸”。一等到他良心發現，知道自己眞在當漢奸，面目，受了敵人的過甚刺激時，於是，這就是他們動搖的時候了。所以，敵人對他們，是不大十分信任的，利用着，同時也監視着。在敵人眼裹，他們漢奸的程度，這是不够的。張自忠的終於被敵人踢開，就是這個緣故。否則的話，他將來反正的可能，也不是沒有的。過去，這一類例子很多，已反正的不必說，未反正的比如李守信，于英，等等，皆是。</p>
<p>第三類，是躲在“維持地方”這藉口下，來替敵人辦種種事情的人物·像北平地方維持會”會長的江朝宗，就是屬於這一類·表面看，為了免除地方糜爛，而出來和敵人周旋周旋，這也許並非是十分壞事吧：但，我們一檢查他們所辦的事，實在是超過了所謂“維持”·比如，北平“地方維持會”所已替敵人辦的事，大槪有這幾項：㊀會動過二十九軍自北平撒退，㊁勸駐在北苑的三十八師阮玄武旅，全部向敵人繳械四千餘枝，㊂替敵人給資，遣散潛伏北平四郊的保安隊，㊃替敵人辦種種糧秣車輛等物。固然，他們也曾要求過日本兵不要進城，也曾要求過平津間允許通車，也曾要求過敵人不必直接對人民有所舉動，並且會按了一架一萬號的電話，說是：如有人民遇有　敵軍的糾紛，即呌這號碼的話，“維持會”就可出頭向日軍接洽了，云云。但結果，替敵人辦的事，是辦了：要求敵人的，除平津間勉强一天可通一次火車外，（為了連兵，敵人不能把平津交通，完全斷絕。），其除要求，等於白費。所以，肥計下來，維持奮1成了敵人的供應機關：實際上，也就盡了漢奸的任務。而且，這些“地方維持會”的人物，在過去的北洋軍閥時代，大多會做過相當的高官，在敵人眼裹，正是未來傀儡政權裹的適當人選。大名鼎鼎的江宇老（江朝宗字宇澄），不必說了；其餘像周肇祥會做過湖南省長；呂均曾做道尹以及某大帥的秘書長之類，皆是。</p>
<p>第四類的漢奸，是過去失意的軍閥，官僚等類人物，他們的大本營，是天津租界。在平時，大家在報上，所看到的所謂一寓公，就是指的這般人。他們在敵人眼裹，是所有各類漢奸裹，最有力的。一面是為了報復過去被打倒的仇恨，一面為了再過過官的癮，於是，就不恤做敵人的工具。他們善於觀望風勢，而且是有辦法的，所以，未來的傀儡政權里，捋盡是這類人們的天下。代表的人物，比如齊夑元，賈德耀等人，就是。</p>
<p>平津的漢奸，除上述四個類型而外，我們本來還可以舉出許多類型的。比如，為了保全身家，而不惜做漢奸的如北平商會會長冷家驥（日軍進城後，地一做了北平偽市長）之類·為！尋找飯碗，而當漢奸的，如．些失業的留日學生，和大學畢業生之類。有為了想魚肉地方鄉愚，而自命為某縣某某自治會代表，而組織了某某會，獻身投靠的土棍地痞之類；又有受敵人廉價收買的各種無恥之徒，亡命之徒，……</p>
<p>總之平津的漢奸，的確是“多如牛毛”。那些不關全局的，在這裹，不再一一類述了·記者離開平津的時候，已經看到五花八門；在目前，花樣一定更多了吧·然而，平津如果一天不收復，那末，像那麼適宜於漢奸存在的環境，那些漢奸的種類，一定會更加繁殖下去的。</p>

<h3>Despite Victory, No Arrogance; Despite Defeat, No Discouragement: Our Loyal and Brave Soldiers Recover Luodian</h3>
<p>Charging Through Heavy Rain and Mud to Kill Enemies and Achieve Extraordinary Merit; A Bloody Battle of Life and Death Before Shuli Bridge; Our Troops Press Close to Yangxing and Engage in Fierce Fighting with the Enemy</p>
<p>The following is the confirmed battle situation from the front lines as of 2 AM this morning, obtained by this newspaper:</p>
<p>① Since around 5 PM on the 14th, after the enemy army desperately seized Shuli Bridge, they continued with airplanes, cannons, and tanks, covering their infantry to fiercely assault our □□ Division's positions at Gujiajiao, Xiezai, and Wujiaqiao. After the division's □ Brigade bravely resisted, fierce fighting continued into the night, resulting in heavy casualties. Moreover, because the positions there were too exposed and were almost completely destroyed by enemy artillery fire, around 1 AM on the 15th, they launched a counterattack against the enemy, inflicting a heavy blow, and then calmly occupied the positions at Houjiazhai, Caizhai, and Zhuzhai, up to the north-south embankment, and engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. Since the morning of the 15th, the enemy army divided into three routes to continuously attack our positions. One route, using more than ten tanks to cover their infantry, fiercely attacked the north-south embankment positions. Another route attacked Qianzhai, Mengzhai, and Houjiazhai from Gujiajiao, Xiezai, and Wujiaqiao. Still another route attacked Beizhudian from Hejiadian. After the division's loyal and brave resistance, they killed many enemies. After a day-long bloody battle, the positions remained unchanged. On the previous (15th) night and yesterday (16th) morning, the two sides were still engaged in fierce fighting in the aforementioned locations.</p>
<p>② In the Luodian southwest, regarding our □□ Division, about two companies of the enemy attacked our land positions on the previous (15th) morning, but they were repelled by the division, with dozens of enemies killed, including one squad leader and one squad leader. Examining their remains, they belonged to the 22nd Regiment. Also, a squad leader's diary was found, recording that each squad had twelve men, two light machine guns, and two grenade launchers.</p>
<p>③ Some of the enemy in Luodian have changed their affiliation to northern registration. Our sentries talked across the lines, and it was claimed that they were forced into military service, because their families were in the Northeast and were monitored by the enemy, so even if they were unwilling, they could do nothing.</p>
<p>④ Regarding Liuhang, since the previous (15th) morning, the enemy's main force has fiercely attacked our □ Army's positions, with very intense artillery fire. Because many of our fortifications were destroyed, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifice, we fought the enemy near Chaowangmiao. Since yesterday (16th) morning, the enemy has continued to bombard us incessantly. Fierce fighting is currently underway.</p>
<p>⑤ More than 4,000 additional men from the enemy's 9th Division arrived and landed at the Qiujiang Wharf on the afternoon of the 13th. Including the first 2,000 men to arrive, there were about 6,000 men in total. The rest of their troops are expected to arrive completely today. It is found that this division is a peacetime formation, totaling about 10,000 men.</p>
<p>⑥ The enemy's current deployment is divided into three routes of attack: A, from Yuepu to Luodian; B, from Yangxing to Liuhang; C, from Qiujiang Wharf and Yinxianggang to Jiangwan.</p>
<h3>Our Army Has Pressed Close to Yangxing</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) According to reports received at midnight:</p>
<p>① Yesterday at noon, the enemy army advanced towards Qiujiang Road and Dongbaoxing Road. Our army lay in ambush in hidden places, and waited for the enemy to approach before unleashing a dense barrage of machine gun fire and attacking with hand grenades. The enemy army suffered many casualties and retreated in panic before being able to retaliate. Around 2 PM in the afternoon, the enemy attacked again. At the same time, enemy troops also advanced from the Bazihqiao area, but they were all bravely repelled by our army. Later, around 8 PM in the evening, the enemy artillery positions near Hongkou Park concentrated artillery fire and bombarded our Zhabei area. Our side immediately retaliated with mortars, and the booming of cannons lasted for an hour before stopping. The enemy army then launched a fierce assault on our North Station at 8:20 PM, under the cover of artillery fire. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, they were finally repelled by our army. The enemy army suffered heavy losses. The enemy army has repeatedly attacked our Zhabei and North Station areas in recent days, but they have all failed. Our forces in that area are extremely strong, and the fortifications are also very solid. It is impossible for the enemy army to gain an inch of ground.</p>
<p>② The enemy army twice attempted to land at Lujiazui in Pudong yesterday morning, but both attempts failed. In the afternoon, a motorboat full of enemy troops patrolled the river surface near Lujiazui, but dared not land. Our defense in Pudong is unusually solid. If the enemy attacks, we will definitely inflict heavy losses on them again.</p>
<p>③ After our army recovered Luodian Town, they pursued the victory and recovered the original positions in the eastern suburbs of Luodian Town. Yesterday morning, another group of enemy troops landed at Xiaochuansha to reinforce them. At noon, they launched a counterattack towards Luodian. Our army responded calmly, and the enemy did not succeed until dawn.</p>
<p>④ Yesterday at noon, under the cover of smoke, our army counterattacked the enemy from the line north and south of Yong'an Bridge. After a fresh rain, our army advanced quickly through the muddy water, fighting fiercely with blood. The enemy army collapsed, and corpses littered the ground. By night, our army had advanced to the vicinity of Yangxing and was engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy.</p>
<p>⑤ Yesterday morning, the enemy army bombarded our Jiangwan area. At the same time, the enemy in the city center attacked us under the cover of artillery fire, but they were bravely repelled by our army.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th: Military news. On the 16th, our army counterattacked from Liuhang and recovered several villages near Yangxing, pushing the enemy back more than one kilometer.</p>
<h3>Killing Enemies Like Hemp in Heavy Rain: Our Army Recovers Luodian Town</h3>
<p>And Pursues Victoriously Eastward; Fierce Fighting Also Occurs on the North and South Fronts</p>
<p>The current focus of the war is concentrated on Luodian. The enemy gathered 6,000 elite troops and mechanized units, and on the morning of the 13th, under the cover of cannons and airplanes, launched a fierce attack on the front of our Luodian in three routes: Shuli Bridge and Beizhudian. Our army bravely met the attack, and after fierce fighting for more than thirty hours, on the 14th, a part of the enemy army entered Luodian Town and set it on fire. Because the fire was too fierce, our army immediately withdrew from the town and firmly defended the pre-determined Chen line in the western suburbs. It was not until the evening of the previous day (15th) that our army received reinforcements from the rear, and then immediately launched a fierce counterattack. First, they fired densely with Lee-Enfield rifles and machine guns, then attacked the enemy with hand grenades, and finally charged fiercely with bayonets. Even in the heavy rain, they fought the enemy hand-to-hand in the mud. Our soldiers were extremely loyal and brave, killing enemies like hemp. The enemy army collapsed in panic, with corpses lying all over the ground and few survivors. Our army immediately recovered Luodian Town and pursued the victory eastward. The enemy urgently sent reinforcements, attempting to counterattack, but our army is strong and the enemy cannot succeed. Fierce fighting is still underway. As for the positions on the north and south sides of Luodian, there was also fierce fighting. The battle situation is recorded separately below.</p>
<p>The Enemy Attacks South of Luodian</p>
<p>Our army south of Luodian is holding the key points of the southern suburbs and the North-South Tangkou of Gujia Pavilion, and has built solid fortifications to prevent the enemy's left flank from advancing. On the morning of the 15th, the enemy did indeed concentrate artillery fire to bombard us and launched a fierce infantry attack. Our army resolutely responded, and although under dense fire, they did not lose heart. They lay hidden in the trenches, calmly responding. After fierce fighting until noon, the enemy had no opportunity to take advantage of, and because of the rain and muddy roads, tanks and other vehicles could not move. The enemy lost its center of gravity, and remained in front of our positions, hesitating to attack. After our rear artillery positions bombarded them fiercely, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated without any result.</p>
<p>Our Army Attacks the Enemy North of Luodian</p>
<p>To the north of Luodian, we took the offensive, and on the 14th, with two columns of about one regiment in strength, advanced fiercely forward under the cover of artillery fire. By the morning of the 15th, we had advanced to the line near Zhangjiayan, Hejiazhai, Lijiazhai, and west of Dingjialou, pressing against the enemy's right flank. The enemy resisted stubbornly. Our army then used light and heavy weapons, as well as hand grenades and bayonets, to charge in hand-to-hand combat. However, the enemy's positions also had dense guns and artillery, like a net of fire. We made full use of the enemy's existing fortifications to support ourselves with hard work, and finally managed to firmly defend the newly advanced positions. At 5 AM on the morning of the previous day, the enemy suddenly launched a counterattack against our left flank with a force of one regiment. After we inflicted a head-on blow, the enemy suffered heavy casualties, with corpses lying all over the ground. We took advantage of the victory to attack and intercepted a banner and military supplies of the enemy's 22nd Regiment. After our side counted the troops, there were also slight casualties.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Thwarting Enemy Attacks Before Shuli Bridge</p>
<p>Shuli Bridge is located southeast of Luodian Town and is an important point on our front. The enemy has been fiercely attacking for days. The area is a focus of attack, and both sides fought desperately, advancing and retreating repeatedly. On the 13th, we lost and regained it twice. On the morning of the 14th, we fought back and forth again. Each time, we used a force of one or two companies or more to fiercely attack the enemy to blunt their advance. The enemy retreated slightly. In the afternoon, the enemy suddenly increased its deployment of eight or nine tanks to cover a fierce attack. After we bravely intercepted them, fierce fighting lasted for three hours. Our brigade suffered slight casualties. Around 5 PM in the afternoon, because the area was too exposed and was receiving concentrated artillery fire from the enemy, making it difficult to defend, we faced the enemy across the river along the embankment between Gujia Pavilion and Xiao Qiantai. Another column crossed the Changdi on the west side of Xin Town, and attacked our Beizhudian position via the East-West Zhaixiang. We resisted bravely, each man doing the work of a hundred, fighting fiercely all night. The enemy did not succeed. At dawn on the 15th, they divided into two routes to attack our Beizhudian and Nanhua Tangkou positions. After our fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and was unable to advance further.</p>
<p>The "Great American Evening News" Reports on the War Record</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" of this city, on the evening of the 16th, published the news of our army's recovery of Luodian Town in a very prominent position on the front page, and headlined it in large characters, stating "Chinese Army in Pudong Waiting for Opportunity to Attack, Recovery of Luodian Town Confirmed," etc. The news carried by the newspaper is translated below: "Japanese main force is currently holding the line from Liuhe to Zhabei, while on the other hand, they are attempting to land in Pudong, in order to contain the Chinese army from the rear. However, the Chinese army in Pudong has deployed its forces and the line is exceptionally solid. As for how the Chinese military force is deployed in that area, the Chinese military authorities remain silent. This morning (16th), four Japanese bombers appeared over Pudong, dropping four bombs on Yangjiadu. Apart from a few houses being destroyed, the Chinese side suffered no losses. This morning, both official and independent sources have confirmed the news that the Chinese army recovered Luodian in heavy rain at midnight on the 15th. On the evening of the 15th, a journalist entered Luodian Town with the Chinese army and returned from the front this afternoon, reporting on the disastrous defeat of the Japanese army. It is said that the losses suffered by the Japanese side were extremely heavy. The Chinese army counterattacked from the eastern suburbs in the dim light of the night and drove the Japanese army into Luodian Town. Fierce fighting then broke out there, and the Japanese army finally collapsed and retreated to the northeastern suburbs. There was also fierce fighting at Yong'an Bridge on the evening of the 15th. The Japanese army launched a large-scale attack on the Chinese army under the cover of artillery and mechanized units. The Chinese army responded calmly, and the Japanese army was finally repelled. At dawn on the morning of the 16th, the Chinese army's positions there remained unchanged."</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Fierce Attack on Yong'an Bridge Was Ineffective</h3>
<p>In the past 24 hours, the enemy army has launched several fierce attacks on our Yong'an Bridge positions with significant forces, hoping to break through this line in order to put pressure on Liuhang. However, our army is well-equipped, and when the enemy attacks, we inflict heavy losses. Moreover, our rear artillery fire poses a great threat to the enemy army. In recent days, the enemy army has suffered heavy casualties and has not gained an inch. For strategic reasons, our army has not pursued, but is holding the line and waiting.</p>
<p>The enemy's artillery units in Yangxing fiercely bombarded our Yong'an Bridge north-south positions from around 5 AM on the morning of the 15th, hoping to destroy our army's positions in order to hinder our army's construction of fortifications. The bombardment continued until 7 PM in the afternoon. Our □□ artillery units also concentrated fire and retaliated continuously.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Bombs Our Positions This Morning</h3>
<p>At around 11:45 PM last night, several hundred enemy troops launched a surprise attack from Beisichuan Road towards our army's positions on Qiujiang Road and Guangdong Street near Yokohama Bridge. At that time, the enemy first fired sparse rifle bullets at our positions from a distance to probe our situation, but our defending troops remained calm and ignored them. Then, the enemy launched a large-scale attack on the aforementioned two places. When our sentries saw them approaching, they responded with a shout, and the reserves came out in force, throwing machine gun hand grenades at the enemy, knocking down the enemy soldiers in front. Fearing that they could not hold out, the enemy urgently deployed reinforcements and concentrated their forces to attack us fiercely. Our army then jumped out of the trenches and bravely advanced, displaying great power. Fighting until about 1:10 AM this morning, we repelled the enemy. Because the enemy suffered more than half of their casualties, they could not vent their anger, and at about 1 AM, they ordered their ten naval guns, deployed from Broadway Road to Tilanqiao, to fire aimlessly at Pudong and Jiangwan Zhabei. A total of one shot was fired every two seconds. They stopped by themselves at 2 AM this morning because our army consistently ignored them, and they felt it was boring. However, the density of the gunfire awakened many sleepers.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Attack on Liuhang Was Repelled by Us</h3>
<p>Regarding Liuhang, there was once fierce fighting at 8:00pm at a location about three li north of Liuhang. There were about one enemy batallion attempting a night raid, which came in total silence in the dark, feeling their way over when they approached my army position, when our outpost discovered them, and opened fire. The enemy dropped to the ground, stopping their advance. Our stationed troops immediately opened up with rifle squads and machineguns, and prepared to stab. The enemy knew we were prepared, and didn't dare advance again, instead retaliating with mortar fire, supporting for about half an hour. Then, our troops jumped out of the trenches, rushing from the middle, and the left and right wings catching up taking an encirclement position. The enemy then fled backwards. We gave chase to a distance of three-four hundred meters, where we surrounded one company, and the remainder fled. Our company commander shouted and ordered the enemy to disarm, but they resisted stubbornly, and then were wiped out by our machinegun fire. Over a hundred rifles, and five light machineguns, were all captured. In this battle, we were victorious, and withdrew leisurely. To this morning, the enemy did not dare harass.</p>
<h3>We Still Firmly Defend Houjia Wooden Bridge</h3>
<p>The position defended by our army at Houjia Wooden Bridge, several li northeast of Miaohang, has remained unmoved since the outbreak of the war. In the past, we once relied on this stronghold to rush to the Huangpu River, but unfortunately, we failed due to the overwhelming pressure of the enemy's airplanes and cannons, and retreated to the original location. Although our main frontline has now shifted to the first line of defense, the Houjia Wooden Bridge position is still being firmly defended due to its extremely important strategic importance. Since the enemy brazenly officially issued the order to attack Nanhua before the 15th of this month, the enemy has been attacking with all their might from the 10th until last night, and the artillery fire has not ceased. The river channel in this area is winding, and the front lines are winding. The enemy and our army face each other across the river. You can hear laughter at close range, and even at a distance, it is only a few tens of meters. But comparing the two front lines, the enemy army suffers more lateral fire, so the losses are also greater. The night before last, the enemy crossed Jiangwan stealthily, and we captured fifteen people, only two of whom were Japanese, and the rest were our compatriots from the Northeast, who were forced to come, and said that they had long intended to defect, but had no chance. We will send them to the rear properly to show preferential treatment.</p>
<h3>Our Army Repels the Enemy North of the Yunzaobang</h3>
<p>North bank of the Yunzaobang, previously (15th) discovered enemy army infantry-cavalry combined troops, with two mortars, which were active near the Miaoji and were building emplacements along the bank. Our sentries targeted and fired, and the enemies fell and died. The remainder, seeing our preparations, retreated into the nearby village.</p>

<p>Reprinted from the American "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Reconnoitered Various Places Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the dim light of dawn, four enemy planes began to spy on Pudong, circling for a long time. They strafed Lujiazui, Yangjiadu, Dongjiadu, and other places with machine guns, and dropped more than a dozen small bombs. They flew away around ten o'clock. In the afternoon, more enemy planes flew to Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong to reconnoiter. Around five o'clock, another enemy seaplane reconnoitered Pudong's Lan Nidu, Lujiazui, and Changjiadu at low altitude, and strafed with machine guns from time to time. The plane flew to Wusongkou after 6:30.</p>
<p>Around 4 PM in the evening of the day before yesterday, two enemy planes dropped several long, cylindrical stones, weighing about thirty or forty kilograms each, behind Qichang Station and the Asia Petroleum Depot in Pudong.</p>
<h3>Our Military Spokesperson Refutes the Japanese Side's Absurd Fabrications</h3>
<p>Actually Claiming That Our Artillery in Pudong Bombarded Japanese Rescue Ships</p>
<p>Our military spokesperson said that the Japanese side is spreading its absurd fabrications again, actually claiming that our artillery in Pudong bombarded Japanese rescue ships. This is the most foolish rumor in the world. What must be stated now is that the Japanese rescue ships are always close to the Japanese warships, and their purpose is unknown. We have never heard of any Japanese rescue ships being bombarded, although it has been clearly proven that hospitals established by Chinese and churches, such as the Red Cross rescue personnel, have been repeatedly attacked by the Japanese army. Although the Japanese side is trying to conceal its crime of attacking non-combatants, its inhuman and unjust acts have been deeply imprinted in history.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Military Strength in Shanghai Is Eight Divisions</h3>
<p>The Recent Transfer to Shanghai Is an Entire Division; The Kurume Division Has Been Almost Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>This newspaper's special report: The enemy's invasion of Shanghai this time has resulted in extremely heavy casualties due to our army's brave counterattack. Therefore, since the outbreak of the war, they have requested reinforcements from their country more than ten times. Before the 12th of this month, the enemy troops dispatched to Shanghai were composed of elite troops drawn from the standing army divisions. The recent transfer to Shanghai is an entire division, namely the Kanazawa 9th Division. Its advance units arrived on the 13th, and another part arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is expected that they will all arrive today. This newspaper's reporter has learned from reliable sources that the enemy's military strength in Shanghai is actually eight divisions. The deployment of their forces is as follows: ① Luodian area: six regiments; ② Yuepu area: four regiments; ③ Wusong area: six regiments; ④ Zhanghuabang area: four regiments; ⑤ Qiujiang Wharf area: three regiments; ⑥ Concession area: three regiments (i.e., from Beisichuan Road to Yangshupu) and three marine corps regiments; ⑦ About two engineering regiments; ⑧ About a hundred light and heavy artillery pieces; 150 naval aircraft; 100 army aircraft (wartime organization, each regiment has 4,500 men).</p>
<p>Confirmed news: It has been discovered that the enemy troops operating in the Shizilin area some time ago were the Kurume Division's mixed brigade. After being repeatedly attacked by our army, they were almost completely annihilated. It is now learned that less than one-third remains, and they are currently reorganizing and replenishing.</p>

<h3>Enemy Battleships Sail to Wusongkou</h3>
<p>According to reports from the front yesterday morning, many enemy ships are anchored in the river near Liuhe and Chuanshakou, seemingly preparing for further landings.</p>
<p>Confirmed news: The enemy's large battleship Nagato has already sailed to Wusongkou and is now anchored in the Sancha Water area outside Wusongkou. The ship has a displacement of 33,300 tons. Japan has only four such large battleships.</p>
<p>Before dawn yesterday (16th), about 3,000 additional enemy reinforcements arrived, divided among three enemy destroyers (two No. 3 and one unidentified), and sailed to the Huangpu Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf and the Osaka Wharf to reinforce the enemy in the Hongkou area.</p>
<h3>Two Enemy Attacks on Pudong Were Repelled</h3>
<p>At around 8 AM yesterday morning, the enemy destroyer No. 17 anchored at the Japan Mail Line Wharf, the destroyer No. 2 at buoy No. 4, and the destroyer No. 16 at buoy No. 6 suddenly jointly opened fire and bombarded our Pudong Lan Nidu and Lujiazui areas. Soon, many enemy motorboats, full of enemy troops, sped to the Nanyang Cemetery wharves, hoping to land. Our defending troops initially ignored them, and when their motorboats approached the wharves, they immediately fired machine guns. Seeing that our side was prepared, the enemy fled in panic, but many were killed by us. At around 10 AM, the enemy attacked again with the same trick, attempting to land and first firing machine guns at the shore. However, after our defending troops densely returned fire, the enemy retreated in dismay. At 12 noon yesterday, the enemy destroyer No. 1 suddenly sailed inward and anchored at the Japan Mail Line Wharf, seemingly still unwilling to give up the attempt to land in Pudong.</p>
<p>When the enemy artillery on Broadway Road bombarded Pudong and Zhabei with heavy artillery this morning (17th), an enemy ship anchored in the Huangpu River in front of the Japanese Consul General's office lowered four small motorboats, carrying about a hundred enemy soldiers, and patrolled back and forth in the Lujiazui and Chunjiang Wharf areas, seemingly spying on the movements of our defending troops and attempting to attack and land. However, when the reporter left a certain place at 3 AM this morning, no enemy soldiers dared to approach the east bank.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Erupts Repeatedly in the Zhabei Area</h3>
<p>At around 8 AM yesterday morning, the enemy artillery positions near Hongkou Park opened fire again and bombarded our Patriotic Girls' School and Bazihqiao, with infantry attacking at the same time. Our artillery also opened fire in return, and the booming of cannons lasted for two hours. Our troops met the attack on separate fronts and charged bravely. The enemy finally could not hold out and retreated. At noon, fierce fighting broke out again in the old factory area of the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road. The enemy army attempted to attack our positions, and we densely fired machine guns and hand grenades. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy army suffered considerable casualties and retreated again. At the same time, a fierce machine gun battle also took place in the Bazihqiao area. The enemy attempted to cross Bazihqiao, but ultimately failed.</p>
<p>After our army retreated to the first line of defense, the enemy army has been bombarding our Zhabei in the city center Jiangwan area intermittently for days, especially yesterday. From morning to night, the sound of cannons never stopped. Our army responded calmly and also retaliated with heavy artillery from time to time. At around 1 PM in the afternoon, the headquarters of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces at the end of Beisichuan Road was hit by two cannons and suffered considerable damage. Many other shells fell near the headquarters. Around 3 PM, the Japanese elementary school and the Japanese naval parade ground were also hit by more than ten shells. The enemy army was quite embarrassed.</p>
<h3>Three Enemy Planes Shot Down in Jiading</h3>

<h3>Heroic Act of Killing the Enemy Before Retreating</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After our troops retreated to the first line of defense, the advanced units of the □□□ division stationed near the downtown area were ordered to hold the line firmly and retreat slowly. A Mr. Wang was wounded last night and came to Shanghai. A reporter interviewed him at a certain location, listening to his oral account of the heroic last battle on the original position, which is worthy of recording. Mr. Wang said, 'At dawn on the 14th, our main force had already reorganized and moved to a new defense. Our □ people were ordered to stay put for three hours before leaving the defense line. At this time, the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, averaging two shells per minute. Shells rained down around us. After about an hour, the artillery fire stopped, and more than a hundred enemy soldiers advanced towards us, about a hundred meters away. We fired intensively with rifles and threw hand grenades, and saw dozens of them fall to the ground one after another. The rest retreated in panic, probably because the enemy was timid, thinking that our army was prepared, and did not dare to venture forward. At that time, three of us were also wounded. The remaining × people took the opportunity to go out of the trenches to search and saw that among the thirty-five enemy corpses, except for four or five who were seriously injured, the rest were dead. We seized two machine guns, twenty-eight rifles, and many other military supplies. Then, after the allotted time, we calmly withdrew from the position and returned to the team to await reassignment. The three of us were only able to be admitted to the hospital for treatment this morning.' This battle shows a glimpse of the bravery of our army.</p>
<h3>Korean, Taiwanese, and Ryukyuan Compatriots Awaken and Rise Up for Independence and Liberation</h3>
<p>Grievous Words from Students Studying in Japan: A Once-in-a-Thousand-Years Opportunity to Shed Blood and Fight for Life</p>
<p>The War Affairs Knowledge Research Association, organized by students who returned to Shanghai from studying in Japan, yesterday specially issued a document flying a message to Korean, Taiwanese, and Ryukyuan compatriots, urging them to seize the opportunity to declare independence. The words were extremely poignant. The following is a translated version of the original text: 'Dear Korean, Taiwanese, and Ryukyuan compatriots, the Chinese nation's war of resistance against Japan has fully unfolded. This is not only for the Chinese nation but also a sacred war of resistance for human justice and East Asian peace. Japanese imperialists have been scheming to enslave all the weak and small nations of East Asia, sucking them dry of every drop of blood. Their many years of brutal and inhuman policies towards you are proof of this. Seeing you being trampled and massacred under the dark and sunless iron heel of Japanese imperialism, and yet you continue your unyielding struggle to win national liberation, is truly worthy of admiration throughout the world. Now is an excellent opportunity for you. The representatives of Japanese imperialism—the Japanese military—are leading hundreds of thousands of troops to invade North China and Shanghai. In the Shanghai war, the ferocious and evil Japanese army has encountered fierce resistance from our loyal and brave national army and has suffered heavy blows, with more than 30,000 casualties. However, the war-mongering Japanese warlords do not know repentance and plan to use the full force of their nation to invade on a large scale. This is precisely your excellent opportunity. Our side will take on the responsibility of annihilating the enemy who comes to invade in large numbers. You can take advantage of the thin defenses in their home country to raise the flames of national liberation movements, launch uprisings everywhere, create chaos in their rear, force them to attend to both ends, exhaust them, and drive them to despair. You must know deeply that if you want independence, liberation, and to wash away years of shame, you can only achieve this goal by seizing this once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity to shed blood and fight the enemy for your lives. Dear compatriots, rise up immediately without hesitation. Rather than living as beasts of burden for generations, it is better to die swiftly and gloriously for national self-salvation and killing the enemy. Rise up, compatriots! Long live Korean independence! Long live Taiwanese independence! Long live Ryukyuan independence!'</p>

<h3>Zhang Yilin Proposes the Creation of a Laozi Army</h3>

<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, upon reading reports of Zhang Yilin's proposal to create a Laozi Army, deemed his uncle admirable, but believed that military organization should be rigorous and that military titles should not be used lightly. He sent a telegram to advise against it. The original telegram is as follows: Mr. Zhang Zhongren of Wuxian, Zheng Bao, reports that your proposal to create a Laozi Army is full of heroic spirit, enough to inspire the people. This is deeply gratifying. However, at the time of resistance, what is hoped of the elders in various places is to supervise and lead the younger generation, strengthen defenses, mobilize the masses, and assist in military affairs. Even if the country is in extreme danger, elders should not be asked to die on the front lines. Moreover, military organization should be rigorous, and military titles should not be used lightly. Please stop this proposal and consider other ways to contribute to the peace. Even a cry from the heights can inspire the cowardly, and the country is already deeply grateful. This is my humble opinion; I hope you will understand. Chiang Kai-shek, Xian (16th) Served as Secretary Jing. (Central News Agency Telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>The United States is Willing to Strive to End the International Arms Race</h3>

Hull also instructed the representatives to explain the United States' economic policy abroad as much as possible and stated that other countries also need to adopt it. Hull said, 'The U.S. government is now making every effort to prevent the arms race from turning into the tragedy of war. I believe that focusing on economic issues can promote the arms race. When the sincerity of the United States in other countries is clear, it is willing to participate in the new disarmament conference thereafter and believes that the U.S. government's insistence on adopting constructive actions to seek the liberalization of international trade is therefore a necessary condition for achieving this goal.

<h3>League of Nations Passes Sino-Japanese Dispute to Advisory Committee for Handling</h3>
<p>Result of Yesterday's Executive Yuan Meeting, Gaining U.S. Cooperation to Increase Strength</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Executive Council met at 5:00 PM today and resolved to hand over the dispute between China and Japan to the 23-nation Advisory Committee for handling. (Central News Agency Havas Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Hours before the League of Nations Executive Council meeting today, British and French representatives firmly asked Chinese representative Gu Weijun to postpone his request for the League of Nations to invoke Article 17 of the Covenant in order to obtain U.S. cooperation. British and French representatives believed that the best approach for both China and the League of Nations was to restore the 1932 Advisory Committee. Gu also expressed his approval. The Executive Council then met at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the League of Nations' convening of the 23-nation Advisory Committee to handle the Sino-Japanese issue, U.S. sources here recently stated that the United States had previously agreed to attend the committee and had not subsequently announced its withdrawal. However, U.S. diplomats stationed in Switzerland or Geneva must wait until they receive new instructions from the White House before they can attend again.

<h3>Our Preliminary Demands to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Ambassador Gu Explains Further</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Executive Council is scheduled to hold a meeting at 4:00 PM this afternoon. China's chief representative, Dr. Gu Weijun, will attend and deliver a brief speech, providing a clear explanation of China's preliminary demands regarding the Sino-Japanese incident. These demands were already explained by Gu in his speech at the League of Nations General Assembly yesterday and are divided into three items: 1) Morally condemning the aggressor; 2) Issuing a clear condemnation of Japan's illegal blockade of China's coast; 3) Condemning Japan's bombing of undefended cities. (Central News Agency Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The speech given by Dr. Gu Weijun, China's chief representative to the League of Nations, at yesterday's General Assembly, with a spirit of perseverance and composure, highlighted the need for urgent action regarding the situation in the Far East. His words have deeply impressed all sectors of the League of Nations. In his concluding remarks, Dr. Gu stated that the League of Nations can take three actions: 1) Consideration and action by the League of Nations Executive Council itself; 2) Formally submitting the issue to the League of Nations General Assembly; 3) Submitting the matter to the Advisory Committee established in 1932 to handle Sino-Japanese disputes. It is expected that the League of Nations will adopt the third strategy. The Chinese government seems to be expecting the League of Nations to take action in this regard. The Executive Council can handle it accordingly at today's meeting. The Advisory Committee is composed of 23 countries and still exists. The Soviet Union, as a member of the Executive Council, will naturally occupy a seat on this committee. The Consultation Committee will ask Japan to explain its reasons without forcing Japan to accept any obligations of the League of Nations. It is said that the Chinese government may not have further applications to the League of Nations before the result of submitting this matter to the Consultation Committee is clear.

<h3>League of Nations General Assembly Announces Postponement</h3>
<p>No One Registered to Speak, Unexpected Strike</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations General Assembly began its general debate on the 14th. As usual, speakers must first register with the Presidium. There are 52 countries attending this General Assembly, with a total of 400 representatives. Today, no one registered to speak, so today's meeting could not be held, and the general debate had to be temporarily suspended. However, it is generally speculated that this unexpected 'strike' state may end tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, at which time representatives of several major countries will take the stage to express their grand opinions. In addition, the various committees of the General Assembly also have the same phenomenon, especially the Legal Committee. When the committee met this morning, it included the issue of women's status, which was requested for discussion by representatives of 15 countries at last year's General Assembly, on the agenda. However, because no one registered to speak, Chairman Politis, the Greek Minister to France, had to announce the postponement of the meeting immediately after it began. Such a desolate scene is unprecedented. In addition, there are two matters that are worth noting: First, Spanish Prime Minister Negrín will deliver a speech at the Executive Council meeting at 5:00 PM today, explaining the application submitted to the League of Nations regarding the attack on Spanish ships in the Mediterranean Sea. Second, the application submitted by the Chinese government regarding the Sino-Japanese issue has been included on the agenda of today's Executive Council meeting. However, according to the Chinese government's recommendation, this application will be submitted to the 23-nation Advisory Committee established by the League of Nations' Provisional General Assembly in 1933 (the United States is also included) for handling. This has been confirmed. (Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>The United States Imposes an Arms Embargo on China and Japan</h3>
<p>Opinions of Our Delegation</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the U.S. government's ban on its ships from transporting arms to China and Japan, members of the Chinese delegation here do not believe that President Roosevelt's move is intended to appease the isolationist faction. A Chinese representative told a Havas reporter, 'President Roosevelt's intention is probably to prevent Japan from having an excuse to blockade the Chinese coast and to delay the time so that he can calmly discuss a common policy with other relevant countries. In short, the only conclusion we have reached after receiving this news is that convening the League of Nations Advisory Committee as soon as possible is an urgent matter, because after the League of Nations' Provisional General Assembly established the Advisory Committee in 1933, the United States agreed to participate in the committee with other major countries.

<h3>The Attitude of the War-Mongering Countries is Strong</h3>
<p>Determined to Strengthen the Anti-Communist Front, Not Caring About Breaking Ties with the League of Nations</p>
<p>[Geneva] According to a Japanese spokesperson here, if the League of Nations takes positive action on China's complaints, Japan will completely sever relations with the League of Nations, and will refuse to cooperate in its non-political activities such as economic, social, and opium-related work. It will also strengthen its anti-communist front with Germany, Italy, and other countries dissatisfied with Moscow's conspiracy. According to the spokesperson, no matter what action the League of Nations takes on China's complaints, Japan will certainly pursue its established policies in the Far East. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] After Dr. Gu Weijun, China's chief representative, delivered his speech at the League of Nations General Assembly this morning, the Japanese observer distributed a report to the delegations of various countries to explain the origins of the dispute between China and Japan and to respond to Dr. Gu Weijun's speech. The report also included Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota's speech to the House of Representatives on the 5th of this month. (Central News Agency Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Concerned About Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>But Unwilling to Implement Neutrality Act; Ban on Exporting Scrap Iron and Scrap Copper</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt recently held talks with Secretary of State Hull and former chief delegate to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, lasting two hours. The discussions likely revolved around the international situation. Regarding this, responsible US officials have stated that the US government does not intend to take any action or change the current situation in either the Far East or Europe. (Central News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>[New York] The New York World-Telegram stated in an editorial today that the US President has not invoked the Neutrality Act with respect to China and Japan. The announced ban only prevents US government vessels from transporting war materials to the Far East. As neither China nor Japan has formally declared war, President Roosevelt wishes to avoid any event that could draw the US into the vortex of war. This is the attitude that most Americans want the President to take. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt continues to pay close attention to the Sino-Japanese war. Meanwhile, Secretary of Commerce Roper indicated that government ships may be prohibited from transporting cotton and scrap iron to warring countries in the Far East. Roper stated that in the first seven months of this year, Japan purchased US cotton worth $192,050,000, an increase of $87,000,000 compared to last year. China purchased $36,955,000, an increase of $11,000,000. This situation may be due to a sudden increase in legitimate industrial needs. Therefore, the United States must study whether these ordinary commodities are being used as war materials and consider all aspects of the relationship. The government is willing to increase foreign trade, but does not want American merchants to only consider profits and drag the country into other countries' disputes. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced today that the US Navy has banned the export of naval scrap iron and scrap copper for two months. Recently, economists and military experts have criticized the sudden increase in exports of scrap iron and scrap copper, believing that they are being purchased by foreign munitions factories, mostly in Germany, Japan, Italy, and England. This situation poses a danger to the United States and world peace. Therefore, the Navy Department has banned exports. As for whether this ban will be universally implemented, the Secretary of the Navy declined to comment. Commentators believe that although the Navy Department's ban on scrap iron and scrap copper exports and President Roosevelt's ban on arms exports are limited to the government's direct scope, they are intended to be an example for the general business community to follow. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>[New York] The financial community is still studying the government's transfer of war materials to the Far East by changing ships. The impact on countries that purchase war materials from the United States and then transfer them to the East is currently unknown. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 16th)</p>

It is reported that Britain and the Netherlands have reached a complete understanding on this issue, and their common policy is to make every effort to prevent the current situation from turning into open warfare.

<h3>World Peace Congress Suggests League of Nations Aid China</h3>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the Sino-Japanese war, the Executive Committee of the World Peace Congress has passed a resolution advocating: 1) The League of Nations should handle the complaint filed by the Chinese government and issue a final appeal to Japan in accordance with the Covenant; 2) China should be assisted financially or otherwise to resist aggression; 3) All necessary assistance should be sought from all parties to implement collective action to stop aggression. In addition, it made suggestions to the League of Nations regarding: (A) Non-recognition of the demise of the independent state of Abyssinia; (B) Implementation of the various provisions of the League of Nations Covenant to assist the Spanish government and people; (C) Attempts by certain governments to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries should be corrected.

<h3>Re-Understanding the Total War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Guo Moruo</p>
<p>Regarding the total war of resistance, the general understanding seems to focus solely on the extensive scope of the battlefield.</p>
<p>This war originally started in North China. However, our resistance to Japan is not limited to North China. We have also started fighting Japan in Shanghai. In other areas along the Yangtze River and the coast, wherever Japanese aircraft attack, our air force uniformly engages in resistance. In this way, although there is no formal order for general mobilization, in reality, a nationwide unified war effort has already been launched. This phenomenon seems to be what the general public understands as the total war of resistance. This is undoubtedly one aspect of the total war of resistance, and the most conspicuous one. However, it is not the entire picture.</p>
<p>It is incorrect to limit the concept of war to military operations alone. War itself evolves. Even just considering military operations, there has been evolution from the ancient single rider with a single sword and spear, to the modern mechanized, chemicalized, large-scale integrated warfare involving the army, navy, and air force. The scale and form of war have evolved in astonishing ways. This kind of modern integrated warfare is no longer solely a military matter. It concentrates the power of the entire nation. The nation's academia, industry, politics, economy, education, training, etc., must have sufficient cultivation in peacetime, and that cultivation must be systematic and planned, so that it can be crystallized into modern integrated warfare. For example, if our science and industry are not developed, we cannot manufacture large quantities of war vehicles and tanks, nor can we manufacture large quantities of military gases. Our troops will have no way to become mechanized or chemicalized. This situation actually exists for us at the moment. Because China's industry and culture are backward, we experience great shortcomings in conducting modern integrated warfare. Our troops have not only not been mechanized or chemicalized, but our navy has not even been established. Our air force is also insufficient. If we had more aircraft and some submarines in this war of resistance, our war would certainly be more impressive. There is no doubt about that.</p>
<p>A true total war of resistance should involve the wartime organization of all facilities within the national society. The so-called wartime economy, wartime finance, wartime education, wartime social problems, etc., all have experts planning them, and some of them have already been gradually implemented by our government and social organizations. The more complete the planning and the more rapid the implementation, the greater the power of our total war of resistance. Regarding the planning and implementation of these issues, it is regrettable that the degree of thoroughness and speed cannot be said to correspond at all with the current military operations. This, in our view, is a dangerous sign. All of our planning and facilities were already lagging behind in peacetime. Now, in wartime, if we continue to lag behind, we will greatly increase the difficulty of our war of resistance.</p>
<p>Now, let's cite a few examples to prove this.</p>
<p>For example, consider the relocation of Shanghai's yarn factories to the interior. This is an issue that has been widely discussed since the outbreak of the war. The government has also established regulations to encourage relocation. However, until now, everyone is still waiting and watching. The relocation of yarn factories is not only an important national policy that benefits the country, but it is also of absolute benefit to individuals operating industries. Under the current circumstances in Shanghai, it is impossible to continue operating under any circumstances. Even if Shanghai were to regain peace in the short term (which is definitely not the case), Japanese aggression has no end. Sooner or later, the same war will inevitably occur again. Shanghai has been proven to be a place where national industries cannot be located. Moreover, as a result of the Battle of Shanghai, more than two-thirds of the Japanese yarn factories were destroyed. This is giving our cotton yarn industry an opportunity to expand. Smart industrialists should see this and automatically move their industries to the interior, without having to wait for the government to spur and reward them. However, even after being spurred and rewarded, everyone is still watching and unwilling to move. As a result, many unemployed workers have fallen into becoming refugees. Those who cannot escape the war zone are forced by life to be lured by the enemy and become traitors to the country and nation. This wavering attitude is truly a loss of both people and resources for the country.</p>
<p>Recently, we saw in the newspapers that this year's cotton harvest is abundant. I went to Pudong twice a few days ago and saw farmers along the way collecting cotton. Everyone was collecting diligently, with large and small bags. Indeed, it presented a scene of abundant harvest. This should have been a cause for celebration in peacetime. However, in the current wartime, it is something that deserves our deep consideration. In peacetime, the cotton from the Zhejiang area was mostly purchased by Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai. As a result of this year's war of resistance, the Japanese yarn factories have been destroyed, and the outlet for cotton cannot but become a problem. Therefore, the livelihood of farmers in the cotton-growing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang cannot but become a problem. If this large group of farmers loses their livelihood, they will inevitably become refugees again. And some of them will only think that the result of the war is that they have lost their livelihood, and they will inevitably become traitors, to be used by the enemy. I think at this time, the government is too busy with all kinds of government affairs and wars. Some things are really difficult to take care of at the same time. The responsibility should be borne by our smart and patriotic capitalists. For example, do not hoard your own capital. Take out more to buy cotton, relieve the lives of farmers, quickly move the factory inward, and start work quickly, so that unemployed workers can return to work. This is a business that benefits their own industry, but it is already implementing the highest national policy.</p>
<p>The above is a statement of the fact that wartime industrial planning is being promoted very slowly. In addition, the wartime diplomatic plan is also being promoted equally slowly. It is as clear as seeing fire that we need the help of international friends in this war of resistance. Our diplomatic officials are working hard, and have indeed achieved considerable success in international relations. However, relying solely on formal diplomacy is not enough. Therefore, a plan to launch national diplomacy was proposed more than a month ago, hoping to select cultural figures with international prestige as national representatives and send them to Europe and the United States to mobilize the forces of the people in countries such as Britain, France, and the United States, so that they can understand the significance of our war of resistance and provide us with spiritual and material assistance. This is absolutely necessary. For example, capitalists in some countries may lend money or auction off a large number of arms to our enemies during the war of resistance. In our war of resistance, which has not declared war, formal diplomacy cannot prevent this. But if we launch national diplomacy, and gain the sympathy of the public in those countries, the desire for profit of capitalists will at least be slightly restrained. That kind of negative result would already be a great benefit to us. If there are positive results and we can establish mutual assistance pacts with various countries that love peace and respect culture, then the benefits to the country will be immeasurable. However, the motion to launch national diplomacy has been around for a month, and its realization has had no effect. On the contrary, according to newspaper reports, Japanese national diplomacy has been launched before us. Even the candidates have been decided. In this way, we are again falling behind in wartime planning. If we want the war of resistance to be prolonged, and hope that the war of resistance will be victorious, that is a bit like going south by driving the chariot north.</p>
<p>In short, the meaning of the so-called total war of resistance deserves our re-understanding, and what we hope for, especially the powerful figures in the private sector, should seriously implement the answers to this question. There are quite a few incidents that should not necessarily have to wait for the government to handle. There are even more things that, after being handled, are not only beneficial to the country, but also beneficial to individuals at the same time. I hope that everyone will take on the responsibility of implementing the actual total war of resistance before the sacred oath to defend the country and nation. (September 15th)</p>
<h3>Italy Strives for Equal Rights in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Threatens to Abandon Neutrality in the Spanish Civil War; Nyon Agreement Annex Signed</p>
<p>[London] Italy has expressed its intention to abandon its neutrality in the Spanish Civil War because it cannot be on an equal footing with Britain and France in the Mediterranean surveillance plan. Diplomatic circles in various countries are very concerned about this matter today. The Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia published an editorial today, asking whether Britain and France want to respect Italy's rights in the Mediterranean, or will disregard Italy and take responsibility for monopolizing the Mediterranean policy? Which to choose is up to the governments of the two countries to decide. Diplomatic circles believe that if Italy abandons neutrality, Germany will follow suit, and Soviet Russia will inevitably openly aid the Spanish government. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>[London] There is a rumor here today that Italy intends to secretly send another 150,000 troops to Spain to complete its work of helping the Spanish rebels capture Madrid before winter. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The implementation plan of the Nyon Agreement has been completed today. Two annexes drafted by naval experts were signed this morning. "Annex 1" specifies the areas that countries can reserve for their submarines to practice in international waters. "Annex 2" delineates the main routes that merchant ships can travel and be protected by warships. The request to Italy to participate in the surveillance plan is still valid. If Italy joins, it can still initiate and participate in this meeting. According to those involved in the Nyon Conference, Britain and France only invited various countries, and were not acting as spokespersons for the conference. The rumour that the British government believes that Italy cannot actually assume an important role in preventing piracy has now been denied by London, and it believes that Britain and France want to implement the current measures immediately. If Italy wants to participate in the future, this plan may be revised so that Italy can appropriately share this work. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding Italy's refusal to participate in the Mediterranean surveillance measures, British officials recently stated that the signatory countries of the Mediterranean Agreement will conduct negotiations with Italy in the short term to discuss the extent to which its request for equal status can be satisfied. Regarding this, Italian officials stated that if the country can obtain equal status, then the previous proposal to submit the Mediterranean security issue to the London Adjustment Council for discussion can be abandoned. However, the full text of the Mediterranean Agreement should still be copied to the various committees. In general, people in Britain believe that the surveillance measures contained in the Mediterranean Agreement should still be implemented immediately, and will not be delayed due to Italy's request. However, as a result of the negotiations, Italy may be allowed to participate in surveillance work with naval forces equal to those of France. Although some British officials regard the Mediterranean Agreement as a lesson for Italy, the British government, in view of the upcoming meeting between Mussolini and German leader Hitler, fears that after refusing Italy's request for equality, it will only make the political axis between Germany and Italy stronger. Therefore, it may ultimately agree to Italy's participation in surveillance with equal naval forces. It is not necessarily impossible. (Havas, Central News Agency, 15th)</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister's Visit to Germany Nears, Berlin Prepares a Grand Welcome</h3>
<p>Streets are decorated with lanterns and festoons, high towers and triumphal arches are being built; the ceremony is grand and comparable to the coronation of the British King</p>
<p>[Berlin] As Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is about to visit Germany in return, the German authorities are actively preparing a grand welcome. The grandeur of the ceremony is comparable to the coronation of the British King. Painters, architects, stage directors, and musicians in the capital have recently organized a special committee to be responsible for preparing various decorations and entertainment programs. The avenue from the Forbidden City, through the capital, to the Olympic Stadium is being actively arranged by the authorities to be decorated with lanterns and festoons, and to hang the national flags of Italy and Germany, and the emblems of the Fascist Party and the National Socialist Party. Stands have also been set up along the way, which can accommodate tens of thousands of spectators. Hundreds of square pillars, twelve meters high, have been erected along the "Unter den Linden" avenue, adorned with golden eagles. The electric lights are all on at night, which is extremely magnificent. The first triumphal arch has been erected near the Brandenburg Gate on Paris Square. In addition, many craftsmen are now rushing to build multiple high towers, all decorated with the emblems of the Italian Fascist Party and the German National Socialist Party, and a triumphal arch is being erected on Tiergarten Street. A flag tower, 52 meters high, is being built on Hitler Square. The German authorities also plan to hold a large-scale celebration in Tiergarten Park, the scale of which is comparable to that held to celebrate Hitler's birthday. As many as 3,000 musicians will participate. (Havas, Central News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3>Strict Rear Area Arrangement for Air Defense, Traffic, and Elimination of Traitors</h3>
<p>Military and Civilians Can Cooperate Effectively; People Donate Money to Purchase Anti-Aircraft Guns</p>
<p>The National Society's reporter has inspected our rear area for days, and has made short stays on the Jinghu and Huxiang-Sujia three railway lines, where he has been informed that our rear area is extremely peaceful. The military and civilians can cooperate effectively, and divide the work on air defense, traffic, rescue, elimination of traitors, etc., and arrange it properly. For example, for air defense, many places have built temporary shelters, and Nanjing and Pukou are even more perfect. What is especially rare is that the people in various places have dedicated their private wealth for the purchase of anti-aircraft guns, etc. For traffic, the people in the interior, in view of the enemy's repeated attacks on our important transportation routes, have not only destroyed our railways, but also the highway bridges are also the targets of enemy aircraft attacks. In order to prevent this incident from happening, in addition to military and police officers being responsible for protection, local able-bodied men have also formed teams to guard. Recently, new roads have been built near the bridges on the highway, in case they are used after enemy aircraft attacks. Secondly, the work on rescue and elimination of traitors is also very complete. Under the guidance of party and government organs, the people in various places have organized anti-enemy support associations that can be used in a lively manner. After the reporter's inspection, I deeply feel that the people in our rear area can automatically shoulder the responsibilities that should be drawn in the long-term war of resistance, which is really a good phenomenon in the voice of the war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Subscribes to 10 Million Yuan of National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Guizhou Branch Subscribes to 3.5 Million Yuan; Colleagues of the Economic Commission Subscribe to 160,000 Yuan —Women's Group Issues a Letter to Women in the City—</p>
<p>The General Association of the National Salvation Bond Promotion Committee received telegrams from various parties yesterday reporting the subscription situation. The original contents of each telegram are recorded below: (1) Telegram from Wen Qun and Yang Xiaobo of the Jiangxi Branch, stating that Jiangxi Province should subscribe to 10 million yuan of national salvation bonds, and will do its best to raise the funds; (2) Telegram from Wang Cheng Rong and Peng Xian of the Guizhou Branch, stating that the national salvation bonds in our province are currently being raised urgently. 500,000 yuan will be raised by all sectors of Guiyang City, 2.5 million yuan will be raised by gentry and wealthy people in various counties, and 500,000 yuan will be raised by public officials in the province, totaling 3.5 million yuan. Please review and approve; (3) Telegram from Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission, stating that subscriptions to national salvation bonds are enthusiastic from all parties. Colleagues of the Economic Commission dare not follow others, and plan to subscribe to 160,000 yuan. The Women's Group of the Municipal Headquarters for Promoting National Salvation Bonds has issued a letter to women in the city to arouse women's enthusiasm for subscribing to national salvation bonds, saying briefly: The enemy is concentrating its army, navy, and air force to attack us. Our government could no longer tolerate it, and has determined to wage a long-term war of resistance. However, in terms of financial resources, there must be a unified plan and full preparation. Seeing this, the government has issued 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds on September 1. In this critical moment when the country is at stake, we can only contribute our lives and property to the country in order to enrich national strength, wage a long-term war of resistance, and seek national survival. If we women recognize that we are part of the country, we should also jointly assume the responsibility of saving the country. The letter concludes by urging the purchase of national salvation bonds.</p>
<h3>Those Who Buy Foreign Exchange Should Buy an Equal Amount of Bonds</h3>
<p>The Municipal Federation Asks the General Association to Investigate and Promote Subscriptions</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation of this city sent a letter to the Municipal Citizens' Promotion Headquarters yesterday, saying: I hereby inform you that, according to a joint letter from various branches such as the Tenth District of our Federation, the government has issued 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds. Calculated by population, there is only a little more than one yuan per person. Judging from the enthusiastic purchase of foreign exchange by our people since the Lugouqiao Incident on July 7, the amount of national salvation bonds is not difficult to raise immediately. All Chinese people, from government officials to vendors, including wealthy merchants, landlords, and wealthy households, must be no less patriotic than others. It is a pity that the road to saving the country has not been opened on a large scale before. Now that they have been given the opportunity to purchase national salvation bonds, those who purchase foreign exchange will be able to purchase national salvation bonds equivalent to the amount of foreign exchange purchased. If not, it must be because no one has promoted subscriptions to them. Fortunately, those who purchase foreign exchange all have account books to check. You only need to suggest to the promotion association to carry out subscriptions to them. The matter concerns saving the country, and we specially request your association to quickly suggest to the promotion association to immediately carry out subscriptions to those who purchase foreign exchange, so as to benefit the country. It is urgently prayed.</p>
<h3>The Business Community in This City Promotes National Salvation Savings</h3>
<p>Those with a Monthly Salary of 50 Yuan or More Should Have 10% Deducted Monthly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued an announcement yesterday, saying: The National Salvation Bond Promotion Committee, in order to encourage the people to accumulate financial resources for a long time and purchase national salvation bonds on a large scale, has created the National Salvation Savings Program. All of us in the business community should do our best to promote it. Starting this month, for employees' salaries of 50 yuan or more, 10% should be deducted monthly. For those with less than 50 yuan, they should be encouraged to subscribe freely. The business director will open a national salvation savings account on behalf of each person, accumulate savings for a long time, and work together to save the country. Each industry association is responsible for advocating and implementing the plan, examining it from time to time, and jointly promoting progress. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3>Zhang Fakui Leads Officers and Soldiers to Purchase National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Subscribing to 10,000 Yuan; Zhang Buys 2,000 Alone</p>
<p>After the issuance of national salvation bonds, Zhang Fakui, director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Border Area, immediately led all officers and soldiers to automatically subscribe to 10,000 yuan. Zhang alone purchased 2,000 yuan, and the remaining officers and soldiers subscribed according to their abilities. They were very enthusiastic, and the quota was quickly filled. It is also heard that the people in various counties under the jurisdiction of the office have also risen up and enthusiastically subscribed. It is expected that the amount will be considerable in the future.</p>
<h3>More Than 4,000 Students from Beijing and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Now Dispersed in Various Ports, All Willing to Sacrifice for the Country</p>
<p>According to students from Beijing and Tianjin, there are more than 4,000 students from Beijing and Tianjin, according to reliable surveys, now in various ports such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Jinan, Taiyuan, and Hankou, with the most in Taiyuan and Jinan. There are more than 200 people in Shanghai and Beijing. These people have expressed their willingness to travel to various places purely because of their patriotic heart. These 4,000 pure youths are willing to sacrifice for the country under the leadership of the government.</p>
<h3>Legal Action Against Traitors</h3>
<p>Using Enemies, Buying Ruffians, Secretly Going to the Mainland to Probe Military Intelligence</p>
<p>In the Pudong area, there are shameless traitors who, after receiving heavy rewards from the enemy, not only probe military intelligence but also take the opportunity to rob civilian property. Many have been killed in recent days. Yesterday at 4 PM, another traitor was robbing a certain family's residence near Tiediqiao when he was shot dead by National Defense troops.</p>
<h3>Submarine Cable Cut Again</h3>
<p>Expected to be Repaired Soon</p>
<p>The Great Northern, Eastern Extension, and Pacific Cable Companies' submarine cable was previously cut off in Wusong. Due to ongoing battles in that area making repairs inconvenient, a temporary line was installed in the Huangpu River to allow normal communication with the rest of the world. However, this line was also damaged on the night of the 15th at 10 PM. It has since been determined that the damage is located at the river mouth. It is expected that repairs can be completed within a few days, and normal communication will be restored.</p>
<h3>Women's League Expands Donation Campaign</h3>
<p>The Chinese Women's Movement League held its second women's donation drive last month, resolving to expand the donation plan. They hope that patriotic women can actively participate and generously donate gold and silver ornaments to contribute to the nation.</p>
<h3>Cholera Rampant in Both Concessions</h3>
<p>Overall Mortality Rate Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Recently, the epidemic in Shanghai has been rampant. According to the third report from the Public Concession's Municipal Council Health Department and the French Concession's Municipal Council Health Department the other day (15th), the number of cholera cases in the two concessions continued to increase to 649. The French Concession estimated 384 cases, and the Public Concession estimated 258. The number of foreigners suffering from this disease has also increased to 14 as of the 14th, an increase of more than a hundred people compared to the 539 reported on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Please Invest in Buying Cotton to Aid Pudong Farmers</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Jiyi, a 70-year-old resident of Pudong, issued a declaration yesterday requesting consideration for investments in buying cotton to aid Pudong farmers. The declaration reads: "To Whom It May Concern, in Pudong, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian, Jinshan, and other counties, 40-50% of the villages strictly cultivate rice, and 60-70% cultivate cotton. Now, in this time of national crisis, Shanghai's commercial yarn factories have ceased operations. As a result, Pudong's cotton businesses are not buying cotton, leading to unimaginable hardship for cotton-growing families who lack rice for meals. According to fellow villagers who have come to Shanghai, cotton was selling for 500 cash per catty at this time last year, but this year it is only selling for 110 cash. Hundreds of cotton businesses, for the sake of caution, are unwilling to open scales to buy cotton, leading to nine out of ten cotton-growing families being empty of rice and suffering unbearably. I, Jiyi, propose that all benevolent gentlemen, with enthusiasm for aiding farmers, invest according to their abilities, whether it be one hundred or two hundred yuan for larger investors, or ten or twenty yuan for smaller investors. The funds can be entrusted to cotton businesses to buy and store cotton on behalf of the investors, so that cotton-growing families without rice will not lament their lack of food. Once the Japanese soldiers retreat, the price of cotton will rise, and at that time, the cotton purchased by the public can be sold, and the principal and profit can be recovered, without any loss. To ensure the safety of this principal, it can be guaranteed by the signatures of the heads of each town, village, and Baojia, ensuring no danger. Furthermore, fluctuations in buying and selling prices can be promptly notified by the town and village heads to all enthusiastic gentlemen who are assisting farmers, to reassure each shareholder and maintain the credit of each business. This is specially declared, hoping for your understanding and active participation, which is greatly anticipated."</p>
<h3>International Refugee Evacuation Association Urgently Seeks Donations</h3>
<p>The International United Refugee Evacuation Committee, organized by well-known Chinese and foreign figures in Shanghai, is dedicated to evacuating Chinese refugees to the mainland. At its inception, the first phase aimed to raise 200,000 yuan to cover expenses. Chinese and foreigners responded enthusiastically, and within three weeks, 70% of the funds were raised. However, in recent days, donations have not been as forthcoming as before. Yesterday, Sir Robert Ho Tung remitted a donation of 5,000 yuan from Hong Kong, bringing the total raised to 116,686.78 yuan. In addition, Wu Techeng, Chairman of Guangdong, has pledged to donate 10,000 Guangdong dollars. Recently, due to the expanding scope of the war, refugees continue to arrive in an endless stream, and the originally planned 100,000 yuan is far from sufficient. Therefore, a second donation drive is being launched. The first phase of donations is urgently needed to be fully raised within one month from the launch date, that is, before the 25th of this month. It is hoped that charitable people in this city will generously assist, so that displaced refugees can return to their homeland as soon as possible. The merit of this act is immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Sewing Cotton Military Uniforms</h3>
<p>Recruiting Volunteer Seamstresses</p>
<p>The local Qingnian Jiuguo Fuwutuan (Youth National Salvation Service Corps) is now entrusted by Ms. He Xiangning, who is in charge of the China Women's Association for Comforting and Defending the War of Resistance Soldiers, to recruit ladies from all walks of life to voluntarily undertake manual labor, sewing mostly silk and cotton military uniforms and anti-virus masks, for the use of the soldiers fighting on the front lines. Anyone who is enthusiastic and eager to serve is requested to register at the office of the Corps at 1422 Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>Introducing Garment Workers</p>
<p>The China Trade Introduction Society wrote to this newspaper, saying, "We have dozens of garment workers who have lost their jobs due to the war. They have entrusted our Society to introduce them for large-scale sewing work and are willing to accept extremely low wages. At this time when the weather is gradually getting colder, both the soldiers at the front and the military and civilians in the rear urgently need cold-weather supplies. We believe that there is no shortage of philanthropists who will generously donate. We believe that this measure can reduce the burden on those who generously donate and can also maintain the livelihoods of dozens of people. Therefore, we are writing this letter on their behalf. If you have any of this work, please write to our Society or call (96304) for notification, and we will immediately inform and send someone to contact you."</p>
<h3>Unified Registration of Agencies Collecting Comfort Goods</h3>
<p>Since the start of the War of Resistance, various organizations in this city have launched campaigns to collect comfort goods for encouraging morale and comforting wounded soldiers, for use on the front lines and in various military hospitals. Their patriotic enthusiasm is commendable. However, because each is acting on its own without consulting with others, the collected goods are often the same, while essential items are lacking. The waste of resources is deeply regrettable. The Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association, recognizing this, has specially formulated measures for collecting comfort goods, stipulating that the Shanghai Comfort Association will uniformly collect the goods, so as to concentrate resources and allocate them in a unified manner, so that supply and demand can both be met appropriately. In the future, anyone wishing to collect or solicit comfort goods must register with and be approved by the Association. Those who are already collecting or soliciting goods should promptly go to the Association to complete the procedures. It is hoped that people from all walks of life, regardless of the organization collecting comfort goods, will only accept the official receipt of the Shanghai Comfort Committee. People from all walks of life can refuse to donate if the receipt is not from the Association, so as to avoid malpractices.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Announces Ways for Various Industries to Commemorate September 18th</h3>
<p>Cars Should Temporarily Stop Driving, Stores Led by Boy Scouts</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday announced to various industries: "To Whom It May Concern, the National Humiliation Memorial of September 18th is approaching. At this time of national resistance, a spiritual national defense movement should be held on that day for self-improvement. The prescribed measures are as follows: (1) All stores in the city must lower their flags to half-mast for one day. (2) All employees must observe a vegetarian diet for one day and promote the eating of anti-enemy biscuits (guangbing), to commemorate Qi Jiguang's achievements in pacifying the Japanese pirates. Biscuit businesses, tea and food businesses, cake and pastry businesses, and pancake stalls must all produce more guangbing to meet the demand. (3) At 12 noon on that day, all employees must stand in place, remain silent for three minutes, and after the silence, raise their right hands and loudly recite the anti-enemy oath. The wording is: 'I swear with utmost sincerity to support the government, obey the leader, and sacrifice everything to resist until the end. I swear!' All resume original positions. (4) The taxi industry should notify all drivers through the union to stop driving at 12 noon, and resume driving after the swearing procedure is completed. The above measures are intended to unify anti-enemy steps and demonstrate the determination to avenge the humiliation. We hope that you will inform all members and guide them to implement them diligently. This is essential." The Shanghai Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps yesterday announced to all its members, stating: "The Municipal Party Department of this city, based on the memorial measures stipulated by the central government, has stipulated that the citizens' memorial measures should be led by our Boy Scouts on the 6th anniversary of 'September 18th.' This is to issue the Boy Scouts' guiding of citizens to hold the 'September 18th' 6th Anniversary Memorial Measures, which are to be complied with. The measures are as follows: (1) At 12 noon on 'September 18th,' when citizens across the city hear the radio broadcast announcing that the memorial time has arrived, they should stand in place and remain silent for three minutes. After the silence, they should raise their right hands and swear an oath. The oath is as follows: I swear with utmost sincerity to support the government, obey the leader, and sacrifice everything to resist until the end. (2) If there are many people gathered together before the oath, the Boy Scouts should lead the reading of the oath. (3) Each district corps and its subordinate team Boy Scouts and directly affiliated team Boy Scouts should each be assigned to their locations. Each Boy Scout should lead the merchant star to hold a memorial service. (4) When hearing the noon broadcast, they should immediately lead all compatriots in the store to stand in front of the store to hold a memorial service."</p>

<p>Mr. Jiang Jun to Speak Today</p>
<p>The Youth National Salvation Service Corps is holding a September 18th series of speeches, specially hiring experts Sha Qianli and Zhang Naiqi to speak on various issues of the War of Resistance on different days. Today, Mr. Jiang Jun, an expert on international issues, will speak on "How to Commemorate This Year's September 18th" on the Shanghai Yasheng Radio Station. The frequency is 1120. The time is from 11:00 AM to 11:40 AM every day next week.</p>
<h3>Continuous Autumnal Coolness Leads to Refugee Deaths</h3>
<p>Children Are Especially Vulnerable; Concession Notifies Charitable Organizations to Move Burials</p>
<p>Continuous overcast and rainy days and a sudden drop in temperature have led to many deaths among the large refugee population in this city due to the inability to withstand the cold and the spread of disease. Children are especially vulnerable. According to statistics from the Pushan Mountain Villa alone, about 300 children's corpses are collected for burial every day, and more than 100 adults are also collected. Other burial organizations, such as the Tongren Fuyuantang and the Red Cross, are not included. In addition, there are also family members who collect the corpses themselves but have nowhere to place the coffins and abandon them in the wasteland near Jiaozhou Road and Haig Road. The number is also large. The concession authorities have notified various burial organizations in this city today to quickly move the burials and prohibit the subsequent unauthorized placement of coffins in the above-mentioned areas, so as to prevent the spread of disease.</p>
<h3>Total Number of Italian Troops Stationed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Two Thousand Two Hundred</p>
<p>Rome, Nationalist Seafarers News Agency, 16th: According to news received here, after Italian troops continued to arrive in Shanghai in recent days, there are now a total of 2,200 Italian soldiers in Shanghai. The newly arrived 1,700 will be sent to reinforce the defense of the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>French Postal Ship Carries Foreign Nationals Leaving Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>The French postal ship D'Artagnan arrived at the mouth of Wusong from Kobe at 10:00 AM. Today (17th) at 7:00 AM, it will load foreign nationals at the French Bund Pier and sail from Wusong via Hong Kong and both Canton, Singapore, Colombo, Djibouti to Marseilles.</p>
<h3>Businesses in Nanshi Reopen; Shops Gradually Open</h3>
<p>In the Nanshi area, businesses were once halted after the Nanshi Railway Station was bombed by enemy aircraft. Many days have passed since then. Now, most of the small businesses in the Nanshi area are reopening gradually as of yesterday, because they cannot endure the cessation of business. As for all rice shops, they can only sell after obtaining permission from the Regulatory Committee. Although there are more than ten shops operating in the entire district, it is still not enough. In addition, according to a survey, there are only more than a thousand hotels open in the entire Nanshi district. As for meat shops, there are only those with difficulties in the small vegetable market. Vegetables are also only available from villagers in the Pudong area. The fresh fish business can be said to have disappeared. Among them, the tobacco and paper sundries shops have never closed, and the same is true of tofu shops. The poor residents who cannot stay permanently in the concession are now gradually returning to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>Chinese-Owned Cotton Mills in West Shanghai Resume Operations</h3>
<p>Shenxin, Wing On, and Seven Others</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, all Chinese and foreign textile mills have ceased operations. Now, Chinese-owned mills in the Public Concession of West Shanghai have resumed operations one after another. They include Wing On Factory No. 3 on Maigen Road, Hongzhang Cotton Mill, Shenxin Factory No. 2 on Yichang Road, Shenxin Factory No. 9 on Aomen Road, Tongyi Cotton Mill on Moganshan Road, Xinyu Factory No. 1 on West Suzhou Road, and Xinyu Factory No. 2 on Robertson Road, totaling seven mills, with approximately 374,000 spindles. In addition, Ewo Cotton Mill, a British-owned company, and Gongyi Factory on Robertson Road have also resumed operations. As for Japanese-owned cotton mills such as Neiwaimian, Rihua, Tongxing, and Toyota, none of them have resumed operations.</p>
<h3>Huihua Girls' School Officially Resumes Classes</h3>
<p>Huiqun Girls' Primary and Secondary School and Kindergarten in Tilanqiao, whose school site was located in the war zone and completely destroyed by the enemy, immediately actively prepared for reconstruction. However, it was not easy to obtain a suitable school building in the western district for a while, and it was impossible to notify the new and old students. Now, with the enthusiastic support of the principals of Guozhong School on Avenue Edouard VII and Guohua Middle School on Gordon Road, the school buildings have been borrowed so that students nearby can continue their studies. Classes have officially resumed today. However, some students may still not know the details, and they should contact the school as soon as possible; otherwise, excessive absences will make it difficult to make up lessons and will hinder promotion and graduation. In addition, in consideration of students in the concessions who may not be able to study for a while, a correspondence office has been specially established at 500 Bubbling Well Road. Principal Wang will make other proper arrangements to solve the studies of new and old students.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle Near Luodian for a Day and Night</h3>
<p>Our Side Gained the Upper Hand by Fighting in an Advantageous Position, Wing On Bridge Our Troops Continued to Advance Eastward, Jiangwan and Zhabei We Maintained Our Original Front Line</p>
<p>The enemy planned to break out of Luodian and attack Jiading. At the same time, they launched a heavy force along several routes from Xinzhen and Yanghang, fiercely attacking our line from Wing On Bridge to Gujiage, and then concentrated artillery fire to attack Liuhang, in an attempt to cut off our rear communications. As a result of the fierce fighting in recent days, the attacking enemy was defeated, and the enemy's military plan was severely thwarted. The loss of baggage and ammunition is incalculable. At 2:00 PM today, the front-line report obtained by this newspaper stated: (1) On the east, south, and north sides of the Luodian area, starting from dawn yesterday morning, the enemy heavily amassed reinforcements, using tanks, artillery, and aircraft as cover, and launched another attack on our positions. Our troops, taking advantage of the victory, fought back on several routes. The fierce battle continued for a day and night without stopping. Due to the rain, the enemy's artillery fire was reduced, and the activity of aircraft was also somewhat affected. On the contrary, our combat strength was not reduced due to the weather conditions, so we always had the upper hand. The villages and houses near Luodian were completely burned down by the enemy. (2) The □ division □ brigade troops in the Yong'an Bridge area are actively counterattacking the enemy in Yanghang, recovering several important villages nearby. As of this noon, the front line continues to advance. (3) The enemy shelled Liuhang all night from 8:00 PM last night, but our positions suffered little damage. (4) In the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas, the enemy shelled our positions with platoon fire, and we also returned fire with heavy artillery. The booming sound shook the distant areas and only stopped at dawn. We maintained our original front line without moving. (5) This morning, many enemy aircraft again flew over Pudong to wreak havoc, and enemy warships in the Huangpu River also sporadically shelled our positions, but we suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Enemy Deaths in Luodian</h3>
<p>Two Sets of Enemy Middle-Ranking Officer Remains Recovered, Our Troops on the Left Flank Advanced to Near Doujianong</p>
<p>The enemy who retreated from Luodian was in a state of extreme disarray. When retreating, they set fire to the villages to the north and south of Luodian to cover their retreat. After our left flank troops reached Zhangjiayan, they engaged in fierce battles with the enemy near Doujianong. Our mortar teams unleashed their firepower, destroying many enemy tanks, while the infantry continued to advance fiercely under the cover of heavy artillery. The fighting in the central sector was also extremely fierce. The enemy at Shuli Bridge crossed the embankment and attacked our Qianzhai Xiaozhuyuan and other places. The fierce fighting at the north and south embankments has not ceased for two days. The bloodbath on that side last night was particularly tragic. Our troops still firmly held their original positions. The enemy attacking our Beizhudian right-wing position came with great force. Because the enemy's battles in Luodian were unfavorable, they used all their strength to attack our Beizhudian, in an attempt to contain our forces. After our troops bravely fought, day and night, fighting in a bloody battle, they completely defeated the enemy troops on that side. Several small groups have been annihilated by us.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the focus of the fighting in recent days has been on the Luodian line. The enemy has attacked with all its strength, and we have fought bravely. The town has been lost and regained, and Shuli Bridge has been fought over and over again. In one day, there have been more than three advances. The intensity of the battle is no less than the battle of the Qiujiang Pier and Bazibao. The enemy suffered heavy damage and temporarily has no strength to attack again. While the enemy was retreating in disarray, corpses were scattered all over the field. Our troops are pursuing them to the eastern suburbs of the town to set up defenses and are also collecting the remains of the enemy soldiers, estimated to be more than a thousand. The bodies of two middle-ranking officers were also found.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Near Yanghang</h3>
<p>Our Troops Advanced Eastward Along the Highway, Enemy Counterattacks Last Night Were All Repulsed</p>
<p>After the enemy occupied Yanghang, they continued to advance along the highway, attacking Yong'an Bridge, attempting to attack our Liuhang position. In recent days, the enemy has concentrated its firepower with heavy artillery and aircraft to bombard our Yong'an Bridge position, trying to destroy it. Our troops calmly fought back, firmly defending their positions. Yesterday afternoon, under the cover of heavy artillery from the rear, our troops began a full-scale counterattack against the enemy, advancing simultaneously on both the left and right wings. The roads were muddy on both sides, and the enemy's tanks were completely ineffective. Our troops took the opportunity to advance rapidly eastward, engaging in fierce combat. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated in disarray. Our troops then recovered the important villages near the left and right, such as Fengjiazhai, Shenjiazhai, and Xishenjiazhai, one after another, and continued to approach Yanghang along the highway. By dusk, they had reached near Yanghang. At midnight last night, the retreating enemy, combined with reinforcements, launched a fierce attack on our troops, attempting to retake the positions. Our troops bravely fought back, relying on the defenses to hold firmly. The enemy repeatedly attacked but was repulsed. This morning at dawn, the fierce fighting was even more intense. This afternoon, the situation is still stalemated.</p>
<h3>All-Night Artillery Battles in Zhabei and Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Enemy Warships Hit and Damaged, Moved Away, Fierce Fighting North of the Eastern District, Enemy Suffered Casualties</p>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) At 1:50 AM this morning, the enemy used heavy artillery to cover a large number of enemy troops to attack our positions along the line from Zhabei Tiantongan, Bazibao, to Jiangwan. Our air force also immediately used intensive machine guns, hand grenades, small mortars, and the fierce firepower of mortars to launch a head-on attack. At the same time, the artillery positions on our ×× side also fiercely attacked the enemy's back with heavy artillery, causing our military to hit the enemy's position and the enemy's warship hard. At that time, an enemy warship parked near the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong was hit by our artillery shells, was seriously damaged, and hurriedly moved away. By about 3:00 AM, the sound of heavy artillery gradually subsided, but the sound of rifles, machine guns, and mortars near the North Station was still extremely fierce, especially in the north of Huishan and Yulin Road, about two British miles. However, as a result, our army still stood firm on the original front line because of the solid defense, while the enemy suffered heavy casualties due to the offensive tactics they adopted.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Destroyed Near Beizhudian</h3>
<p>Enemy Tanks Destroyed by Us at Lufubridge</p>
<p>Near Beizhudian Lufubridge, our □ Division □ Brigade shot down an enemy aircraft, which was burned at the time. In addition, several enemy tanks and more than a thousand infantrymen attacked our Lufubridge front position at dawn this morning. After three hours of fierce fighting, three tanks were destroyed by us, and the enemy could not hold on and retreated.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attack on Yangshupu Failed</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that our troops in the Yinxiang District retreated to the Huangxing Road line, but the line along the north of the concession is still firmly defended. The enemy has repeatedly attacked Huangxing Road and Gongmei Road for days, but all have been repulsed by us. Starting yesterday evening, the enemy in Yangshupu attacked us along the concession line, implementing a central breakthrough strategy in an attempt to cut off the rear of our troops stationed in the area. Our troops responded calmly, firing machine guns and artillery, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The fierce battle continued all night, and the enemy finally could not hold on and retreated this morning (17th) at dawn.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that at about 1:00 AM this morning, the enemy artillery positions in Yangshupu opened fire and bombarded our North Station area. Our artillery also immediately returned fire with heavy artillery. The sound of artillery gradually subsided after an hour and a half. Under the cover of artillery fire, the enemy infantry attacked our North Station area at midnight. The fierce battle continued until dawn this morning and was finally repulsed by our army. The enemy suffered heavy damage.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Enemy Reinforcements Continue to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, the Shikutamaru and Jiyomaru, continued to arrive in Shanghai today (17th) and docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf and Huishan Wharf, carrying approximately one thousand enemy reinforcements. According to the reporter's investigation in Pudong this morning, the Huangpu, Huishan, Osaka, and Gonghexian wharves were all full of enemy troops, and they were coming and going in a hurry, as if they could not handle their busy schedules. As for the Unkai Maru and Daiko Maru, which sailed to Shanghai three days ago, the latter sailed out of the mouth of Wusong before dawn today, while the former remains stationed at the Huangpu Wharf and has not yet sailed out.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Shelled Pudong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Our Troops Also Retaliated, Enemy Aircraft Strafed with Machine Guns</p>
<p>There has been no fierce action between the enemy and us on the entire Pudong line. After 12:00 last night, there was only sporadic artillery fire. However, Japanese boats patrolled the Pudong area, frequently traveling back and forth, so they often exchanged fire with our army's machine guns on the shore, fighting and stopping intermittently. At about 9:00 this morning, Japanese warships in the Huangpu River fiercely opened fire again, and our troops immediately retaliated. Both sides fired more than ten shells before stopping temporarily. At the same time, an enemy aircraft flew and circled in the air and strafed passersby with machine guns. At 10:30, it dropped two small bombs near Lujiazui, and the sound of machine guns rang out again. It did not fly away until noon.</p>
<p>The enemy has repeatedly attempted to launch sneak attacks on the Pudong area and land, but they have all been met with a head-on attack by our troops and repeatedly routed. Recently, the enemy again attempted to land. At about 8:00 this morning, the enemy set up several giant cannons at the Japanese Consulate near the Waibaidu Bridge and fired dozens of rounds at our Lujiazui position in Pudong, bombarding our military positions, but our army suffered no damage. Only more than a hundred civilian houses were destroyed by the artillery fire on the spot, and more than twenty civilians were injured, one of whom died from his injuries at the time. Also, at about 8:30 this morning, an enemy aircraft constantly strafed the Nanshi riverside and Pudong with machine guns. Then, at 9:15, it suddenly dropped three or four bombs in Yangjiadu, Pudong, and fired machine guns before flying away. Then, at about 10:00, the aircraft flew to that place and Lujiazui again, constantly dropping bombs, and did not stop until noon.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bomb Chaoan</h3>
<p>[Shantou] Two enemy aircraft flew to Chaoan yesterday afternoon and dropped three bombs, then flew to Jieyang and dropped two bombs, all hitting civilian houses, causing minor injuries. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Westerners Express Sympathy for Our Resistance Against the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Moulmein News: Japan's large-scale invasion of China has caused unfairness in the opinions of foreigners here. A certain French person who receives the radio, fearing the long distance and hardship, rushed to the Chinese Daily, which is run by overseas Chinese, and translated the above news into Chinese for publication and distribution after receiving the news of our military's victory. Moreover, the French who operate the remittance business in the local area are willing to fulfill their obligations and do not accept remittance discounts and rewards, and some are generous and enthusiastic in donating, hoping that the Chinese army will defeat the Japanese army. From this, it can be seen that even Westerners sympathize with our country's resistance against Japan, and Japan's barbarity and cruelty are especially despised by the world.

We are holding positions south of the station in a stalemate with the enemy. In the afternoon, an enemy armored train once reached south of Xingji, showing an offensive posture. Our armored train was located at Yaoguantun, about six or seven li away, and the railway tracks three or four li further north were damaged, heading east. (Sixteenth Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Our Troops in North China Resisting Heroically, Enemy's Invasion Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Although our troops in North China lack tanks, aircraft, and heavy artillery, they are now fighting to the death to contain the Japanese army's southward offensive along the Pinghan Railway. The Japanese side claims to have made slight advances on the left flank,展开 thirty [sic] miles from Tianjin. However, judging from the situation, our troops in that area are resisting very effectively, preventing the Japanese army from achieving its goal of encircling our troops. The Japanese army is advancing south along the railway from Liangxiang, thirty-five miles south of Beiping. While they have gained some ground, it is very limited. The Japanese army claims to have occupied Fangshan and the nearby mountainous areas west of the railway. However, our troops are still holding the ridges and villages east of Fangshan. The Japanese side claims that occupying the mountains allows them to control the main road behind the ridges leading south, enabling them to flank our positions at Liulihe. The Japanese side also anticipates being able to capture Liulihe and Zhuozhou soon. After launching an offensive on a narrower front since Tuesday, the Japanese army has engaged in bloody battles on both flanks, from the mountains west of the Pinghan Railway, through Gu'an, to a point thirty miles from Tianjin, a front approximately seventy miles long. On this front, the Japanese army claims to have occupied several small villages and towns. After crossing the Hun River, the Japanese army reportedly advanced four to nine miles in the initial twenty-four hours of fierce fighting. It is estimated that over 100,000 of our troops are fighting to cover the retreating forces, resisting the mechanized Japanese army. In covering the retreat, entire companies often perish completely in battle. According to Japanese sources, the troops at Liangxiang are under the command of Sun Lianzhong, while the troops at Gu'an are under the command of Wan Fulin. Snow has fallen in Shanxi Province, making the fighting even more difficult. Several thousand fresh Japanese troops have recently arrived in Shenyang from Japan, which has caused considerable surprise. The Japanese spokesman here vehemently denied the rumors of the defection of puppet troops and stated that the Soviet-Manchurian border is now adequately protected. The dispatch of new Japanese troops to Shenyang is said to be for the purpose of reinforcing the Japanese army in North China. (Central News Agency, Seventeenth, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Decides to Refer Sino-Japanese Dispute to Advisory Committee for Handling</h3>
<p>Our Representative Has Expressed Acceptance</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Council of the League of Nations held a closed-door meeting at 5:00 PM today. The Chairman, Spanish Prime Minister Negrín, decided to refer the dispute between China and Japan to the twenty-three-nation advisory committee. Previously, the Chinese representative, Dr. Gu Weijun, the ambassador to France, delivered a speech explaining that China's complaint was based on Articles 10, 11, and 17 of the Covenant. Japan's aggressive actions not only threaten China's territorial integrity and sovereign independence but also endanger world peace. Therefore, all nations should take wise and effective measures to stop it. China trusts that the Council will choose an appropriate procedure to handle China's complaint. Chairman Negrín then followed with a speech, stating that the mission of the twenty-three-nation advisory committee is to assist the League of Nations in completing its tasks and to encourage non-member states to engage in talks with member states to decide on the actions each should take. If the Chinese representative agrees to refer the dispute between China and Japan to the advisory committee, the Council will immediately request the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, to convene it immediately. Negrín also stated that the Chinese government's statement submitted on the 30th of last month, the supplementary statement submitted on the 8th of this month, and the complaint submitted on the 12th have all been delivered to the member states of the advisory committee and the member states of the League of Nations. Dr. Gu Weijun's speech at the General Assembly yesterday and the minutes of today's Council meeting will also be sent to each country. At this point, the Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, immediately stated that he accepted this arrangement, but stated that China's complaint, after being handled by the advisory committee, must still be submitted to the Council for discussion. The Chinese government also reserves the right to request the Council to take various measures in accordance with Articles 17, 10, and 11 of the Covenant, if necessary. (Central News Agency, Sixteenth, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Council of the League of Nations held a closed-door meeting today and decided to submit China's application regarding the Sino-Japanese conflict to the advisory committee of twenty-three nations formed in 1933 to consider the Manchurian Incident. The committee will be convened at the beginning of next week. In 1933, the committee was chaired by the Dutch representative. This time, a new chairman will need to be elected. Considering China's application by the advisory committee is a more flexible procedure than the Council considering it itself. Therefore, a fundamental decision on how to handle the case has not yet been made. China's chief representative, Dr. Gu Weijun, has accepted this arrangement, but with a reservation, namely that China still has the right to bring the matter back to the Council for consideration and maintains all rights under Article 17 of the League of Nations Covenant. The League of Nations Council's decision has now been notified to the American observer. It is not yet known whether the U.S. government will continue to participate in the work of the advisory committee. (Central News Agency, Sixteenth, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Current Hope Is to Urge the United States to Participate in the Advisory Committee</h3>
<p>The U.S. Government Is Considering Carefully; Likely Not to Refuse</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the Council of the League of Nations' decision to refer the dispute between China and Japan to the twenty-three-nation advisory committee, local newspapers, when reporting this news, all stated that Geneva is currently urging the United States to come forward and participate. Regarding this matter, the State Department stated that it has not received any telegram from the League of Nations. Secretary of State Hull only stated that, regarding the dispute between China and Japan, the United States participated in the Lytton Commission in 1931 and the Sino-Japanese Problem Advisory Committee in 1933, thus creating precedents. However, the government has not yet studied the issue of participating in the advisory committee. Apart from this, Hull refused to issue any statement. (Central News Agency, Sixteenth, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that he had heard that the League of Nations had invited the United States to participate in the advisory committee on the Far East issue. If so, the U.S. government will consider it carefully. Hull was unwilling to speculate on what the U.S. government's decision would be but acknowledged that there was precedent for the U.S.'s cooperation in the advisory committee, as the U.S. government participated in the consideration of the Manchurian Incident in 1933 in an advisory capacity. According to well-informed sources, if the United States decides to join, the U.S. Minister to Switzerland, Harrison, will serve as the U.S. representative. Minister Harrison is currently in Geneva. (Central News Agency, Sixteenth, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Geneva] After the Council of the League of Nations referred the dispute between China and Japan to the twenty-three-nation advisory committee, the general public is asking whether the United States will come forward and participate. People in the Chinese delegation believe that the United States will definitely not refuse. The efforts of China's chief representative, Dr. Gu Weijun, are aimed at urging the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union to take joint action on the Far East. If the United States refuses to participate in the advisory committee, or if the committee cannot achieve concrete results, then it is good that Representative Gu has declared to the Council that China reserves the right to resubmit the dispute between China and Japan to the Council for handling and to request the Council to take various measures in accordance with Articles 17, 10, 11, and 3 of the Covenant, so that we can cope with the situation at that time. In addition, the informal Japanese representative is also very active in this area and has distributed to the various delegations documents on the Lugou Bridge Incident in Hebei Province, China, submitted by the country's Diplomatic Association, Foreign Minister Hirota's speech in the House of Representatives on the 5th of this month, and a report on the Shanghai battles.

<h3>Retired German Army Lieutenant General Praises Our Country's Army Strength</h3>
<p>Our Army's Unyielding Resistance Astonishes Europeans</p>
<p>[Berlin] Retired German Army Lieutenant General Herder recently published an article in the "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung," praising the strength of the Chinese army, stating that, "In the past six weeks, the Chinese army has been engaged in unyielding resistance in the Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin areas, which has astonished Europeans. However, if we pay attention to the reorganization of the Chinese army in recent years and are familiar with the bravery of Chinese soldiers, we will not be surprised by the Chinese army's fervent resistance. Under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, China has made many efforts in military affairs. However, the Japanese navy's blockade of the Chinese coast will inevitably have an impact, as China, despite having several modern arsenals producing good military supplies, must import certain raw materials, especially steel and gasoline, from foreign countries."

<h3>American Ships Continue to Carry American Soldiers, Will Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>One Thousand Four Hundred and Fifty Soldiers</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the U.S. Navy transport ship "Chaumont" sailed from San Diego (California) on the 29th of last month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 19th. The ship is carrying 1,450 American soldiers to help maintain the peace in the International Settlement. It is reported that the ship will carry American expatriates to Manila at the end of this month and then return to the United States.</p>
<h3>Short Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>This time, our country is in full-scale war with the enemy, fighting not only for the Chinese nation but also for human justice. Therefore, regardless of whether a nation has been trampled upon by them or not, if they oppose militarism, they should all unite to fight against the great enemy of justice. In particular, the oppressed compatriots of Korea, Taiwan, and Ryukyu should rise up to seek independence and liberation. Furthermore, the anti-war movement within Japan is also very enthusiastic. Therefore, many workers have burned their oil refineries and gunpowder factories. There have been major incidents of lower-ranking officers spreading rumors. Also, a certain general was assassinated. Although the army authorities refused to announce the reason, they have admitted that he was assassinated. Therefore, these workers, lower-ranking officers, and the certain general can truly be called national heroes and are worthy of our admiration. We hope that these national heroes will continue their efforts until the great enemy of human justice is eliminated.</p>

<h3>Painful Memories (5)</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Shu Di</p>
<p>㊄ Various Types of Traitors</p>
<p>Like a most complete department store with all kinds of goods, present-day North China possesses almost all the types of traitors in the world. The reason why our North China is so suitable for the breeding of traitors is, upon reflection, something we find very distressing and frustrating. First, it reveals the moral decay of a part of our nation. Second, it demonstrates the failure of our national education. Third, the fact that all patriotic people cannot automatically rise up to punish the traitors is the biggest reason why the traitors are free and at ease. Fourth, the government's lack of a comprehensive way to deal with the enemy provides the best opportunity to create traitors. As for the enemy's conspiracies to create traitors for us, that is inevitable and not surprising. Isn't this kind of despicable trick to destroy a country the forte of the Japanese?</p>
<p>The fall of Beiping and Tianjin revealed the miasma-like situation in North China. The faces of all the traitors and would-be traitors were completely exposed, and they were clearly distinguished from the non-traitors. Therefore, there was also a good effect: those who could possibly turn back did so. But there was also a bad effect: those with traitorous tendencies were quickly encouraged to do so.</p>
<p>The term "traitor" has often been misused. Here, the reporter is extremely cautious and, as far as possible, does not include those who have some slight excuse. But at the same time, I also feel the weakness of my personal abilities and have no way to leave a picture of all the different types of traitors.</p>
<p>The first type is the most shameless. Knowing full well that they are acting as traitors, they continue to do so viciously, even openly declaring that this is precisely the path they are willing to take, consciously. The most typical example in this category is Pan Guivei, who took office as the head of the Beiping puppet police bureau after the fall of Beiping and Tianjin. This Pan was the leader of the rioters in the 1931 Tianjin riot. After the special status of the Hebei-Chahar region, he was an important figure in the Hebei-Chahar government and the protagonist of the so-called "new pro-Japanese faction" that suddenly emerged last spring. Because he has made some achievements for the enemy in recent years, he took the seat of the puppet police chief on the first day of the fall of Beiping. When he took office, he summoned all his subordinates and gave them a speech: "We are now acting as slaves of a foreign country. So, those who are willing to do so, stay here; those who are not willing to do so, please leave." Two days later, at a banquet for the press, he went further and said: "For more than 20 years, my aspiration has always been this way. I came out this time not to become an official, but to realize my aspiration. Some people say that I am acting as a traitor, a national traitor. Then, I am a traitor, I am a national traitor." Obviously, he knows how a traitor, a "national traitor," should act because he then took action to prove it. The first step was to issue a notice to the people, saying that the soldiers of the "friendly country" are the most trustworthy and civilized, and everyone can live and work in peace, and there is no need for unnecessary worry. At the same time, he warned that if there is anything improper, then the soldiers of the "friendly country" are also very strict, and if you cause trouble, you will have to bear the consequences. The second step was that when the Japanese army entered the city, he immediately ordered all the police and security team's five or six thousand guns to be confiscated, for the reason that: firstly, the security is jointly maintained by the "friendly country's soldiers," and there is no need to carry weapons; and secondly, carrying weapons may cause misunderstandings with the "friendly country's" soldiers. According to news we received, most of these guns have been taken away by the Japanese army. But Pan said to the press that they were "temporarily stored in the warehouse." On August 8, the Japanese army entered the city. At this time, his third step was to first conduct a strict check of household registrations and bookstores and confiscate wireless radios in order to completely block news, the reason being that it is better to volunteer than to wait for the "friendly country's" soldiers to do it. These measures, in advance, comprehended the enemy's intentions and catered to them, and it can truly be said that he has mastered the essence of being a traitor. He is extremely vicious, even more so than the enemy. Other figures belonging to this category include Chen Juesheng, Zhang Yunrong, Zhang Bi, and so on.</p>
<p>In the second category of traitors, General Zhang Zizhong is the most appropriate representative. This type of traitor is mostly composed of military men and simple-minded people. They do the actions of traitors, but what they say is: "What traitor or not, everyone is just trying to make money. If you say I am, I will say you are a traitor!" Two days after the Xiang River incident, there was a military conference in Beiping. At the meeting, Feng Zhian questioned Zhang Zizhong to his face: "Last spring, you slapped XXX, calling him a traitor. Now, what about yourself?" Zhang Zizhong's reply was: "Okay, you all have territory, have money, and dare to say such sarcastic remarks. As for me, once the fighting starts, Tianjin will be finished, and I won't make a single penny!" This kind of traitor is completely seduced by the enemy with money, position, women, and various other things. However, they have one characteristic, which is that they absolutely refuse to admit that they are acting as "traitors." Once his conscience is awakened and he realizes that he is truly acting as a traitor and is excessively stimulated by the enemy, then this is when he wavers. Therefore, the enemy does not trust them very much, using them while also monitoring them. In the eyes of the enemy, their degree of being a traitor is not enough. The reason why Zhang Zizhong was eventually kicked out by the enemy is this. Otherwise, there is a possibility that he will turn back in the future. In the past, there were many examples of this kind, not to mention those who have already turned back, such as Li Shouxin, Yu Ying, etc., are all examples.</p>
<p>The third category is the people who, under the pretext of "maintaining local order," do various things for the enemy. Jiang Chaozong, the chairman of the "Beiping Local Maintenance Association," belongs to this category. On the surface, in order to avoid local corruption, he comes out to deal with the enemy, which may not be a completely bad thing. But when we examine what they do, it really exceeds the so-called "maintenance." For example, the Beiping "Local Maintenance Association" has done the following things for the enemy: ㊀ tried to persuade the 29th Army to withdraw from Beiping, ㊁ persuaded Ruan Xuanwu's brigade of the 38th Division stationed in Beiyuan to surrender all four thousand guns to the enemy, ㊂ provided funds to the enemy to disband the security teams lurking in the suburbs of Beiping, and ㊃ provided the enemy with various supplies, vehicles, etc. Of course, they also asked the Japanese soldiers not to enter the city, asked for traffic to be allowed between Beiping and Tianjin, asked the enemy not to directly take any action against the people, and even installed a telephone with a number of 10,000, saying that if the people encountered disputes with the enemy soldiers, they could call this number, and the "Maintenance Association" could come forward to contact the Japanese army, and so on. But in the end, the things that were done for the enemy were done, and the requests to the enemy, except for the train between Beiping and Tianjin being able to run once a day with great effort (in order to connect the soldiers, the enemy cannot completely cut off the traffic between Beiping and Tianjin), the other requests were in vain. Therefore, after careful consideration, the Maintenance Association became the enemy's supply organization, and in fact, it fulfilled the task of a traitor. Moreover, these "Local Maintenance Association" figures were mostly high-ranking officials in the past era of the Northern Warlords, and in the eyes of the enemy, they are precisely the appropriate candidates in the future puppet regime. There is no need to mention the famous Jiang Yu Lao (Jiang Chaozong, styled Yucheng). The others, such as Zhou Zhaoxiang, have served as the governor of Hunan Province; Lu Jun has served as a Daoyin and the secretary-general of a certain warlord, etc.</p>
<p>The fourth category of traitors are the frustrated warlords, bureaucrats, and other such figures in the past. Their base camp is the Tianjin Concession. In ordinary times, the so-called recluse that everyone sees in the newspapers refers to these people. In the eyes of the enemy, they are the most powerful of all types of traitors. On the one hand, it is to avenge the hatred of being overthrown in the past, and on the other hand, it is to relive the addiction of being an official, so they do not hesitate to be the enemy's tools. They are good at observing the wind and are capable, so the future puppet regime will be dominated by these people. Representative figures such as Qi Xieyuan and Jia Deyao are examples.</p>
<p>In addition to the above four types, we could have listed many more types of traitors in Beiping and Tianjin. For example, those who do not hesitate to be traitors in order to protect their families, such as Leng Jiaji, the president of the Beiping Chamber of Commerce (he became the puppet mayor of Beiping after the Japanese army entered the city). Some unemployed students who studied in Japan and university graduates become traitors in order to find a job. There are also local ruffians who want to exploit the ignorant people of the countryside and claim to be representatives of a certain county's autonomous association and organize a certain association to dedicate themselves to the enemy. There are also various shameless and desperate people who are bought cheaply by the enemy...</p>
<p>In short, the traitors in Beiping and Tianjin are indeed "as numerous as the hairs on an ox." Those that do not concern the overall situation will not be described one by one here. When the reporter left Beiping and Tianjin, he had already seen all kinds of things. At present, there must be more patterns. However, if Beiping and Tianjin are not recovered one day, then the environment that is so suitable for the existence of traitors, those types of traitors, will definitely continue to multiply.</p>
<h3>Situation of Maritime Transportation After Enemy Blockade</h3>
<p>British, Italian and French Mail Ships Still Operate to Shanghai, Only Pacific Liners Diverted to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Since the enemy's blockade of our North and South China Sea coasts, maritime transportation in this port, regardless of any country's commercial shipping, has suffered a major blow. Enemy ships have also ceased operations and are used for military purposes. The current situation is recorded below as accurately as possible:</p>
<p>㊀ North and South Seas</p>
<p>The transportation between the North and South Seas and Shanghai has been maintained by British firms Butterfield &amp; Swire (太古) and Jardine Matheson (怡和) by dispatching ships, preventing the interruption of maritime transport. Currently, four ships operate between Shanghai and Qingdao, Yantai, and Tianjin. Eight ships operate on the Shanghai to Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou route. Furthermore, two ships operate on the Shanghai to Ningbo route (one Italian ship and one British ship). Previously, the enemy navy had strengthened the inspection of third-country ships entering the port. However, after a joint protest by various consuls, the enemy navy now refrains from inspecting third-country ships arriving in Shanghai. They only use flag signals or light signals for brief inquiries and then allow them to enter. In recent days, cargo owners in Shanghai, anxious to sell off goods stored in warehouses, have shipped out large quantities.</p>
<p>㊁ Europe and America Lines</p>
<p>Pacific mail ships, such as the seventeen President liners of the Dollar Steamship Lines and the four Empress liners of the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company, have all been diverted to Hong Kong for passenger and cargo loading. Passengers and cargo from Shanghai must first take ships of other companies to Hong Kong for transfer. Within the European lines, Blue Funnel Line's passenger ships to Liverpool, British India Steam Navigation Company's mail ships to London, and Italia Marittima's mail ships to Italy all continue to operate to Shanghai as usual. Furthermore, Java Pacific Lijn's ships, Messageries Maritimes's ships between China and France, and Swedish East Asiatic Company's ships of 維昌洋行 also continue to operate to the port as usual. Other cargo ships diverted to Hong Kong include the British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire's ship格林輪, the Danish firm East Asiatic Company's ships, the Tianjin 洋行 ships operating to New York, the German firm H. C. Horn, and Norddeutscher Lloyd's ships between China and Germany. All of them no longer come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>㊂ Japanese Ships</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, the Osaka Shosen Kaisha (日郵社) ships on the Shanghai-Hanshin (阪神) line, such as the Kasagi Maru (笠置丸), Aso Maru (阿蘇丸), Ikoma Maru (生駒丸), etc., were requisitioned for military use. As the fighting in Shanghai continued and the Japanese army suffered repeated defeats, reinforcements were repeatedly dispatched. Due to the transportation of troops, weapons, grain, wounded soldiers, and corpses, ships of the Japanese firm Nippon Yusen Kaisha (日郵社), Osaka Shosen Kaisha (大阪商社), Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (川崎國際), and Dalian Kisen Kaisha (大連汽社), etc., were all requisitioned. Currently, as far as we know, the ships that have been suspended and used for military purposes include: ㊀ Fourteen New York liners, ㊁ Six San Francisco liners, ㊂ Twenty South America and South Africa liners, ㊃ More than twenty European liners, ㊄ More than thirty India line ships, ㊅ For the China-Japan line, except for the Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru, which are operating to meet the country's wartime needs, all other lines have been suspended. Currently, in Shanghai, only two ships on the Nagasaki-Kobe line operate every four days. All other ships have been requisitioned for military use.</p>

<h3>Scout Service Spirit After the Start of the Shanghai Battle</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps, organized by the Shanghai Boy Scouts community, has been quite successful since it began its work. In order to understand the activities of the Corps, the reporter specifically went to the Corps headquarters to inquire about everything. The information learned is recorded below:</p>
<p>Internal Organization</p>
<p>The organization of the Corps is very strict. Its highest authority is the Corps Affairs Committee. The committee has enlisted leaders from the Shanghai Boy Scout community, such as Pan Gongzhan, Tong Xingbai, Leng Xueqiao, Xia Huanxin, etc., totaling more than thirty people, with Leng Xueqiao serving as the Chairman of the Committee. Under the committee, there is one Corps Commander and two Deputy Corps Commanders, with Xu Guozhi serving as Corps Commander and Zhao Weizu and Ni Jiaxi as Deputy Corps Commanders. Wang Gang and Shen Yiqiao were hired as consultants. Below this are four departments: Secretariat, Propaganda, Command, and Enforcement. Under each department are several sections, and under each section are several units. The Director of the Secretariat is Luo Lie, the Director of the Propaganda Department is Zheng Shi, the Director of the Command Department is Shen Yu, and the Director of the Enforcement Department is Ye Chunnian. They are not only enthusiastic about wartime service but also experienced. They engaged in this work during the January 28th Incident and deeply earned the praise and trust of the 19th Route Army authorities.</p>
<p>Participating Members</p>
<p>The Corps began its work on the first day of the outbreak of the Shanghai battle. Initially, there were only 1,000 participating members. Later, the tasks became increasingly complicated, increasing from 1,000 to 2,000, and now reaching 2,500 this month. One-fifth of them are female members. The procedure for joining the Corps is extremely simple and solemn. Those who join in the name of an entire troop form a district sub-corps. Under the district sub-corps are several district sub-teams. Those who join in an individual name are formed into several directly affiliated teams. The number of people in each team varies, depending on the simplicity or complexity of the service tasks. There are currently about 140 directly affiliated teams and about 50 district sub-teams.</p>
<p>Service Spirit</p>
<p>The biggest task of each member is guarding. They can be found in various military hospitals and refugee shelters. They are extremely loyal to their duty of guarding the gates of military hospitals and refugee shelters. In addition, inside the military hospitals, they also assist with nursing and stretcher-bearing work. Sometimes, when there is a language barrier between the wounded soldiers and the nurses, the Boy Scouts will mediate. The wounded soldiers are very receptive to the Boy Scouts' well-intentioned mediation. In the various refugee shelters, they also help teach the refugees to read, sing, and participate in other activities. The general refugees are also quite obedient to these lively and lovely Boy Scouts. Other matters, such as the Relief Committee's escorting of refugees, the Civil Food Regulation Committee's transporting of grain, and the Comfort Group's delivery of comfort goods, are also carefully handled with the assistance of the Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>Assisting in Relief</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the 渭 (Wei) battle, several major tragedies occurred in the non-war zones. The first was the tragedy at the Great World and the Bund on Nanjing Road, the second was the tragedy at the Sincere Company, and the third was the tragedy at the South Railway Station. In each of these tragedies, more than 500 refugees and pedestrians were killed. After each tragedy occurred, the Boy Scouts were able to rush to the scene with great courage and speed to assist in rescue and maintain order. It is also heard that several Boy Scouts made heroic sacrifices in these tragedies. On another occasion, in Minhang Town, about dozens of miles from Shanghai, enemy aircraft dropped bombs, and dozens of residents were injured or killed. Upon hearing the news, the Corps immediately sent Boy Scouts to assist in rescuing the injured residents and bringing them to Shanghai for treatment. This spirit is even more admirable.</p>
<p>Front Line Work</p>
<p>A portion of the Boy Scouts goes to the front line to participate in work every day. They are all older and have a special skill. Their work is mainly to deliver orders, transport supplies, provide first aid, and construct defensive fortifications. This work is indeed welcomed by the general Boy Scouts, but Boy Scouts are not combatants in the first place, so this kind of service seems inappropriate, so it was soon suspended.</p>
<p>Economical Expenses</p>
<p>Most of the Corps's expenses are subsidized by the Anti-Enemy Support Association and donations from various circles, but the expenses are extremely economical. The Corps's headquarters office is borrowed for free, and most of the other supplies are donated by various groups and individuals. Only the food for the staff in the headquarters and the Boy Scouts on duty is a major expense. The service members sent out are taken care of by the organizations or groups in the service location. In short, this lively and pure youth group, because it has strict training and a strict organization on weekdays, can gather in such a rapid manner in this extraordinary period and provide effective services to the country and society, and achieve great results, which is truly admired by society.</p>

<h3>Seven Hundred Volunteer Soldiers Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Italian cruiser Montecuccoli arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 am the day before yesterday (the 15th), sailing from the African Italian port of Massawa. The ship carried a total of 700 Italian officers and soldiers, who were said to be assisting in maintaining the security of the Shanghai International Settlement.</p>
<h3>Post Office Strictly Prohibits Letter Carriers From Soliciting Tips or Holiday Bonuses</h3>
<p>According to Shanghai Post Office news, the Post Office strictly prohibits letter carriers from soliciting monetary gifts or holiday bonuses. If any of the above situations are encountered, all sectors can strictly refuse and inform the Post Office of the situation and the carrier's uniform number by letter for punishment.</p>
<h3>St. John's University Selects a School Site and Opens</h3>
<p>Shanghai's St. John's University on Fanhua Ferry Road held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of continuing to open school this semester, as many former students of the school have registered and are eager to study. As a result, it was decided to open school in mid-October, and the Mainland Commercial Center (大陸商場) was provisionally determined as the temporary school site. Registration for admission will take place on September 30th, October 1st, and the days in between.</p>
<h3>An Application Form Should Be Filled Out for Tax Payments by Check</h3>
<p>To Be Not Subject to Restrictions</p>
<p>The Business Bureau of the Central Bank sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday regarding the issue of tax payments by check, stating that it had approved the Chamber's letter 商字 No. 631, based on the letter from the local woolen industry association, stating that in order to strive for the stability of the rear area's main business, preparations were being made for resumption of operations. However, when purchasing the customs duties of the Jianghai Customs, the current cash value of the general items is subject to restrictions on withdrawals from the Ministry's order. How can a large amount of cash be raised separately? Please comprehensively handle the matter after examination and approval. After investigation, merchants paying taxes by check are not subject to the restrictions of Article 1 of the Measures for Stabilizing Finance. However, for this special payment, an application form should be filled out in duplicate at any time and submitted to the deposit bank for transfer to the Review Committee for approval. Accordingly, a blank application form in duplicate is attached to this letter. Please investigate and notify accordingly.</p>
