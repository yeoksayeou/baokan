<h3>印度民族運動新領袖尼赫魯游歷馬來亞</h3>
<p>— 吳逸生</p>
<p>印度獨立運動的近况　印度國民大會的目的</p>
<p>印度民族運動新領袖尼赫魯努力反英運動，已有十餘年，這次乘着假期之便，偕其愛女漫游馬來亞各地。五月二十三日晨由緬乘“哥利亞”輪抵濱，二十四日離檳成（penang）沿馬來聯邦鐵路過巴里文打，太平，怡保吉隆坡，二十五日抵達新嘉坡。沿途所經上述四地，均小作勾留，受印僑熱烈之歡迎，尤其到新嘉坡時，印僑上自縉紳巨商，下至販夫走卒，一萬餘人齊集火車站，大家都以一瞻此民族領袖的丰采為快。尼氏下車後被羣衆緊緊包圍，連手錶的玻璃也被擠破了，熱烈的情狀，於此可見一班。</p>
<p>尼氏自踏入馬來亞境內，無論英文或華文之日報都用大字標題，群登他的言論，記者用歸納的方法，作一總述如下：</p>
<p>關於印度獨立運動的近况，他只有簡单的報告：印度民族和中華民族同樣具有廣大的土地，衆多的人口，但因為弱小民族，被壓迫民族印度的過去，是非常偉大的，可是現在印度人民却在過着非人的苦生活，全印度的人民，都在貧窮中。英國財政家以銀欵投資，實行商業上的榨取，這是印度人民貧窮的原因。英政府雖不願印度有貧窮狀態之存在，但也沒有辦法。印度政府行政組織，頭重脚輕，耗费至鉅，印度雖為世界上最窮之國家。但國中一部份人員之薪金，乃世界上最高者。故在此種情形之下，印度獨立運動，乃為不可抑止的工作。在過去十七年中，印度曾經實行三次大規模之不合作及不服從運動，就是現在，緊張狀態仍然存在。吾人堅信，印度完全獨立，可望實現，惟何時實現，則不易預言，因為目前的國際情形，變化極為迅速也。</p>
<p>“印度國民大會的政策和目的怎樣？”一位英文報記者問他。他滔滔地闡述：“國大最後的目的，在使印度得到獨立，但亚非如加拿大南斐澳大利亞等自治邦或自治領土，而是完全獨立。倘印度永久為一屬邦，則其子孫將永受奴隸待遇，無論走到何處，都不能避免，這是印度人民所共知的。現在全印度人民，已有百分之七十五至八十為國民大會會員，不同情國民大會者，祇佔極少數而已。印度之新憲法，實為可憎之物，現在遭印民熱烈之反對而棄却之。其不能成功，英政府當然是瞭如指掌的。”</p>
<p>有人詢問尼氏是否反對英人，氏竭力否認。他說：“我所反對的是在印度的英政府，但不是反對英人。我反對英國帝國主義者，也反對任何帝國主義，如德國日本等等。因為英帝國之政策決不會使印度完全自主，有如贈送禮物那麼樣慷概的，印度人民欲得自由，必然沒有許多人想像那樣快，一定要增厚印度人民底力量，使英國不能抗衆，方得完全之獨立。帝國主義是不能妥協的，所以欲求民族的解放，應該先排除帝國主義啊！”</p>
<p>又有人問尼氏，謂印度脫離不列顚後，她將變成其他强國之弱肉，如日本是，這於印度，似非有利。尼氏當即予以極其詳盡的解答。尼氏稱：日本雖為一强國，慣於侵略，但其國內經濟情形極惡劣，是否能有財力，長期侵印，當然大有問題；何况日本介於美國興蘇聯两大國間，此二大國斷不坐視日本攫取印度。日本之近鄰大國為中國，中國雖非强盛，但對日本則極敵視，日本欲完全管治中國，而結果仍然失敗，這就是一個好例子。至於其他列强，實在也不能統治印度，因為列强之均勢已成，巴爾國幹諸小國，尚能因均勢而得保留，何况印度，所以列强均勢，即印度獨立後不受侵略之最好保證。</p>
<p>尼氏述畢，有人向尼氏表示，不贊成激烈行為，尼氏謂，處今之世，實不能緩進，因為全世界已在迅速改換與革變中。尼氏至此復鄭重宣告云，印度將來完全獨立，並非敵對英國，反之，即度欲興英國聯約，作關於政治興經濟之援助，在過渡時間，印度將儘量聘請英國各種專家，訓練印度民衆，使之前進，但這些專家，完全是受印度政府的支配的。</p>
<p>當尼氏與記者談話時，會談起甘地，尼氏謂甘地人格的偉大，乃彼所佩服之領袖，甘地之聲言退休，實乃肉體上的表示，其精神則依然繼續奮鬥。又關於印緬分治問題，氏之意見，希望印度及緬旬人民，能永遠保持合作及友善之精神。</p>
<p>最後，略寫些尼氏對於馬來亞之批評，尼氏說：馬來亞乃富有之邦，鑛產豐富，其他蘊藏尤夥，歐洲失業風潮洶湧，而馬來亞則未受威嚇，馬來亞財政狀况極佳，所以没有政治上的危機，因其如此安穩，所以民衆對於世界各地之任何問題，亦漠不關心。對於旅馬印僑，曾有多番斥責，說馬來亞印僑散漫無組織，也說馬來亞印僑忽視其祖國嚴重局面。</p>
<p>他對於印僑，表示這樣的希望：印度與馬來亞發生關係，將近一千年歷史，當地印僑方面應與此邦各民族聯絡，共圖發展，另一方面，對於祖國問題，應加倍關切，時時予以財政上或其他種種援助。印僑尤應與華人合作，保玲友善，因為中國乃世界上最有活力的國家，目前中國進步甚速，在不久之將來，必能稱雄世界，而印度則仍然落後，這是不可不注意的。</p>
<p>還有需要提及的，尼氏接見華文報記者時，特別表示歡迎，彼謂此次出遊，在緬甸和馬來亞，到處看見華校林立，辦理完善，男女學生，精神活潑給予他以極深刻印象，臨宋，氏謂時至今日，中國之問題，非僅中國一己問題；印席之問題，亦非單屬於印度，而係同屬世界的問題，希望彼此能共喻斯旨云云。</p>
<p>截止記者發稿時，尼氏尚在馬來亞之柔佛，蔴坡，馬六甲等地，受印僑熱烈歡迎。雖然他到處聲明此行任務，乃為遊歷，並非代表印度，在此宣傳，而其實他正是在檢閱實力，到處宣傳獨立運動呀！（六月十日於新嘉坡）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>今年之防疫問題</h3>
<p>— 祺</p>
<p>民國二十年江淮流域大水災。翌年霍亂流行。達三百餘城市。綜計五月至十月。患者十萬餘人。死者不下三萬。各地當局乃傾其全力。為大規模之防治。會天氣漸寒。疫亦自然休止。嗣後每年先事預防。即有疫症發現。亦隨起隨滅。不致釀成大患。上海一隅。因華租當局之合作。與防疫事務所之努力。近數年來亦迄無眞性霍亂發現。今年炎夏又來。據醫界消息。霍亂之流行可慮。未雨綢繆。殊屬必要。茲請就防疫問題。略予論列。</p>
<p>“病從口入”疫症亦往往如是。人當夏令。如果飲食清潔。起居調節。偶有不適。立卽愈治。疫自不易侵入。然即此簡單條件。已非稍有資力者不辦。勞苦羣衆。工畢回家。飢不擇食。環其食具者。率皆營營靑蠅。入晚又有臭蝨惡蚊。擾其清夢。環境惡劣。即予疫菌以進攻機會。一經感染。無力醫治。任其死亡。而又不知消毒。馴致蔓延愈廣。至於不可收拾。故欲預防時疫。須從勞働階級着想。而負衛生行政之責者。必須具有熱烈之慈善心腸。方能防患於未然也。</p>
<p>時疫有回環性。間數年而一發。滬市以防範得力。過去數年。幸已安渡。今年既有重將猖厥之預報。自宜益作防疫之努力。預防方策。要在商勸各自來水公司免費充分供給清水。俾便平民飲用。對飲食物舖嚴加檢查。攤販呌賣切開瓜果。從嚴禁止。住戶垃圾。傾入桶內。不准狼藉滿地。違者重罰。在溝渠及偏僻處所死水。並時澆以石灰水或石炭酸。此外則組織撲滅蚊蠅隊。日夜出動。以冀根本剷除疫源。市民貪凉。深夜露宿。隨時飭警勸阻。施打防疫針汽車。則通行各市區。先期為市民强制注射。各時疫醫院病牀。則廣募各界捐助。多加擴充。俾貧病者得以免費療治。凡此皆老生常談。且為華租當局所熱知。吾人不憚煩凟者。蓋促社會之益加注意耳。</p>
<p>至於內地情形。亦殊不容忽視。內地民衆之衛生知識。多在水準以下。各縣防疫經費又遠不及滬市之充裕。就本報記者之旅行於內地各省者。所得印象。大抵市街狹隘。穢濁薰蒸。牆隅廁所。多為蠅蛆繁殖地。夜間聚蚊成市。吮人膏血。水源惟賴河道。當地居民。一方淘洗米蔬。一方即傾倒便桶。由飲食感染疫菌之機會。自極繁多。鄉民無知。一遇疫氛。祇知乞靈鬼神。其愚可笑。而其遇亦可悲已。故內地防疫之根本辦法。首在組織宣講隊。深入農村。告以時疫來源。及衛生常識。至於防疫方法。具體言之。平時必須清除街路積穢。疏通河道水源。嚴禁傾棄穢物於河渠。並宜廣募當地慈善家。購備防疫器具。為民衆施打防疫針。就公共塲所。設立臨時時疫醫院。免費療治患者。此等措施。皆較易辦到者。今年西北東南各省。紛告旱災。徵諸大災之後。必有大疫之古諺。深望各地當局對於上述諸端。一加注意焉。</p>

<h3>財政折衷案參院否决</h3>
<p>總理最後呼籲　未能挽回頹勢</p>

<p>參院財委會本日午後開會、審查關於財政全權之折衷案、結果仍漠然置之、並另擬新法案、將參院昨日所通過法案中各項限制辦法、幾全數予以採取、其內容主張政府施全權、應以下開兩項目的為限、一卽禁止一切行為之足以妨害公共信用者、二卽維持佛郞價格、務勿越出一九三六年十月一日貨幣法範圍之外、並設法復興財政、保障儲蓄戶之利益、此外政府對於黃金流通•國外匯兌•暨本國外國有價證券、不得採取任何種限制、不得發行强制性質之公債、亦不得變更法蘭西銀行與國家間之現行關係、（按折衷案中、並未載明最後兩點）云、參院嗣於晚間十時開會、首由財委會報告員加德說明依照左派各黨代表團所擬折衷案、政府仍可發行强制性質之公債、並變更法蘭西銀行與國家間之現行關係、以故參院不能認為滿足、財長奧利沃爾繼起發言稱、渠不能接受財委會之新法案、“吾國政治脈搏、萬不能受人箝制操縱、以致妨害我國之信用”、嗣又以顫動之聲慷慨陳辭、謂渠自長度支以來、兢兢業業履行職責、前當去年九月間與英美兩國訂立貨幣協定、郎所以謀國際之合作、“今若“不信任”政府、固非余所能接受、卽“受限制的價任”亦難以接受、余歷年來為所抱理想而進行奮鬬、不願加以背棄、抑諸君亦不能令余背棄之也”云、國務總理勃魯姆嗣亦要求參院通過折衷案、略謂“吾人所代表之政府乃人民陣綫政府、而參院之多數派則並非人民陣綫各黨所組成、過去因參院諸君之求全責備、政府不得不加以遷就、而變更其行動機構、今者政府行動已可收得實效、而參院乃竟變本加厲、對於財政全權法案加以種種限制、殊屬不當、“吾人茲願繼續生存而不求傾覆、內閣生命今實繋於參院之手、若內閣不能繼續生存、則來日大難、諸君其何以善其後乎、溯自現閣秉政一年以還、功業卓著、各項社會法律與財政復興之發𨋃、乃其尤為重要者、又參議院今茲是否欲推翻業經通過之各項法律、抑欲變更多數派之組織、並將現閣與各勞工團體間之關係完全加以變更、當取决於本日之投票、而其後果若何亦請諸君往意反之”云云、最後由財委會主席凱洛發表簡短演說、參議院乃舉行投票、而以大多數否决折衷案、保持參院財政委員會所提出之原案、（中央社二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>談談近衛內閣</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>五月三十一日，林內閣總辭職。六月一日，“近衛組閣”大命降下。六月四日，近衛內閣正式成立。一時不安的日本政局，從此又暫時進入一個“和協”的狀態了</p>
<p>在齊藤內閣末期，卽已有“近衛組閣”的傳說。“二•二六”政變時，“近衛組閣”的空氣也很濃厚。此後，當廣田內閣下台，宇垣內閣流產時，日本朝野上下，也曾一致的希望近衛出馬。但是翩翩貴公子近衛，終於遲疑觀望，不願輕落入政治狂流中，因偶一“不妙”，降低了自己的威信。“千呼萬喚始出來”，近衛內閣是有着這種“派頭”的。</p>
<p>果然，畢竟不同。在組閣的第一日，杉山陸相留任的問題，輕輕解决了，接着米內海相的留任問題，在第二日也得到完滿的解决。遞相政友會党員中島久知平，鐵相民政黨黨員永井柳太郎，雖都是與新黨運動有關的親軍派，未通過兩黨總裁，由近衛指之以個人資格入閣的，但對政黨的“面子”，也算是敷衍下去了。</p>
<p>關於三井財閥代理人，日本銀行總裁池田成彬的辭職問題，組閣本部，在　日午前，卽已請池田的先輩，前一三井合名常務理事有賀長文氏，去和池田接洽。接洽的結果是：“辭職與否，由後任藏相的人選而决定”。還當然是說：必須後任的藏相是能保障三井的利益的，三井的金融資本勢力，纔有與近衛內閣合作的可能。</p>
<p>新內閣的藏相賀屋與宣氏，是由林內閣的藏相結城豐太郎推屬的。賀屋與宣今年纔四十九歲，但在大藏省服務，已經二十五年了。在他任主計局長和預算决算課長時，對各省每年所提出的龐大預算，都能作極細微的檢討。因此在大藏省中，他被稱為“預算之神。從前他的財政計劃，是主張穩健想步武崗田內閣時高橋的健全財政的，但現在當然要發生變化了。</p>
<p>在六月三日的下午，賀屋允許就任藏相後，曾往訪結城氏，請求援助。同時又訪問池田，希望池田能給他很大的支持。雖然未能面會池田，但據說是已可打消辭意了。</p>
<p>近衛公在四日午後親任式終了後的第一次閣議上，曾經說：“企圖緩和國內的對立”。但是在社會矛盾尖銳化了的今日的日本，“對立”是無法避免的。</p>
<p>由於軍部澈底支持，廣田內閣時代編成空前大預算的馬塲瑛一，又入閣就任內相了。同時軍部還表示，要馬塲兼任企畫廳總裁。馬塲一露面，嚇倒了一部份旣成勢力，雄厚的大財閥。這些大財閥，他們和新與軍需工業財閥的立場是不相問的。新與的軍需工業財閥，他們的資本較簿弱，在國外市塲沒有很大的勢力。唯一能集積資本發展資本的方法，只有依靠國內軍需工業的發展。不管軍需工業原料，是如何大量的輸入，不管國家收支是如何的失却均衡，不管輕工業部門受到怎樣的迫害，只要軍需工業景氣，對他們就是有利的。</p>
<p>旣成勢力雄厚的大財閥，他們經營着重工業和軍需工業，但也經營着輕工業部鬥。他們要固守國外已經爭奪到手的市塲，必須不斷的送出生產品去。軍需工業能生產甚麼可以輸出國外的商品呢？而且日本是原料輸入國，紡織業是日本資本主義的骨幹。但棉花和羊毛，都需要從外國輸入。像馬塲那種想防止國際收支惡化，限制輕工業原料輸入的企圖，當然是影響輕工業，防磚日本國外貿易進展的。預算的必須增大，這只是直接增加大衆的苦痛，並不妨害各財閥本身的利益。引起糾紛的最大原因，是在財閥間的利益的矛盾。</p>
<p>結城修改過的預算，比馬塲的預算原案，並好不了許多。但馬塲被罵下台，結城却很有“面子”，就因為日本奮財閥的金融力量，是超過新與軍需工業資本的。</p>
<p>因為人們都相信，近衛內閣是進一步調和軍部，政黨，財閥的强力內閣，所以從五月來销沉着的金融市塲，忽然頓形活躍，三井系和三菱系的許多股票，都顯然漲價了（六月三日讀賣）。到馬塲氏入閣並兼任企畫廳總裁的消息傳出後，經濟市况忽又銷沉下去，這就是日本報紙上所謂的“財界警戒”。</p>

<p>言談</p>
<h3>父親節有感</h3>
<p>— 若英</p>
<p>每逢六月的第一個星期日，是父親節。</p>
<p>這玩意兒的創始，雖比不久前過去的母親節要早三年，但在中國的光景，則似乎沒有母新節的來得熱鬧。這固然可以解釋說，人們對於慈母的恩德，總比嚴父感得更勝一籌，所以就從這些微細的地方，也不由得區別了出來；但更實在的原因，則恐怕在彼而不在此：記念是永遠屬於弱者的吧。</p>
<p>“不准記念”的例子是很多的，這例子中的兩方，屬於要記念的一方面的，總是手無寸鐵的弱者，弱得甚至禁不起一陣風便會“自行失足墮水”；强者方面，则不僅不歡喜記念，有時並且是不准記念的，他們就怕聽垂頭傷氣的哀傷的哭，以免鄰人聽了不舒服。至於屬於喜慶這一類的記念，有時雖然好像格外高興，要來一下普天同慶，但這却為是要表示天下太平，或者是想使人忘記痛苦的綠故，所謂借酒澆愁就是。有時候，並且是“國難時期，一切從簡”，祇開開會或是來一個什麼典禮就算的。</p>
<p>母親飾的比父親節來得熱鬧者，不也正是要使子女們明白身之所出，是由於可憐的母親辛苦撫養的乎？而母親節中活動得最起勁者，也正是這些現在的或未來的母親；至於男人們，則是跟父親節同樣，處之淡然的。</p>
<p>父母的養育之恩是難忘的；但看過“父歸”，則也知道那位不認父親的大兒子也並沒有錯。子女並不是父母的私產，當然更不是奴隸；我們也往往把孩子稱做“小國民”，對於“小國民”的培植，正確的說起來，這責任應該是屬於社會的，民族的，而也可以說，一半是屬於父母的。父母對於子女的出乎天性的監護，子女對於父母的出乎天性的尊敬，這是挺可寶貴的“人性”：而要理智一點，則我們應當說，父母對於子女的負責，那才是天經地義，責無旁貸的責任“孰無子女”，讓子女再對下一代的子女去負責，那不是更好一點嗎？——人類原是往下綿延下去的。</p>
<p>於是問題就接觸到怎樣做個好父親和父母由誰供養上。說得遠一點，這責任是都該由社會來負的，因為每個人都該是一個健全的國民和一個健全的生產者，撫養和教育的責任，原該屬於社會；說得近一點，也可以說是切實於現社會一點，那麼這其中實在也有太大的經濟問題，“易子而食既成為習見的新聞，為了衣食而不得不離井背鄉，流浪到別處去找飯吃，更是現社會中青年們最普遍的現象。你說，怎樣做個好父親？和父母由誰供養？又該怎樣解答呢？</p>

<p>Budget of the Pseudo-Government to Be Greatly Reduced - The Pseudo-Government Will Issue Construction Bonds</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Yin Rugeng, accompanied by Chi Zongmo, Sun Rongbin, Lin Chihming, and others, came to Tianjin by car at 6 a.m. on the 21st. Starting at 9 a.m., they attended a meeting convened by Tadiro at the Zhang Garden residence. Hashimoto, Wachi, Oki, Ikeda, Asai, and Adachi, staff members of the military headquarters, also participated. There was a break at 12 noon, and the meeting continued at 3 p.m. It did not end until 6 p.m., and the various rates were not decided. The discussion will continue on the morning of the 22nd. At the meeting on the 21st, the budget of the pseudo-organization was discussed for a long time. The military headquarters believes that the annual income of eastern Hebei from various donations, taxes, land taxes, and smuggling inspection fees is a total of 12 million yuan, while the expenditure is about 14 million. Recently, the smuggling inspection fees have been sharply reduced, and the security team has been reorganized, resulting in an inability to make ends meet. The budget for the next year must not exceed 9 million yuan. The annual fees of about 600,000 yuan for ronin and traitors who are nominally advisors and councilors will be cut across the board. To build highways, the pseudo-construction department entrusted the pseudo-East Hebei Bank to issue construction bonds of 500,000 yuan from July 1, to be amortized over three years. 13,000 yuan will be allocated from the deed tax every month as a fund for amortizing principal and interest. The bonds are named "East Hebei Government Construction Highway 6% Bonds" and are divided into four types: 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan. The details were agreed upon in Tianjin on the 21st. On the evening of the 21st, Yin hosted a banquet for the military headquarters, South Manchuria Railway, China-Japan Industrial Development Company, and Japanese leaders in the pseudo-office on Penglai Street.

<h3>Central Memorial Weeks</h3>
<p>He Yingqin Speaks on Military Reorganization, Chairman Lin Speaks on National Integrity</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At the Central Memorial Week on the 21st, He Yingqin reported on the "military reorganization" of our country, starting from the Qing Domain of Japan. The original speech was four thousand words long, beginning by stating that the greatness of every nation must go through hardship and difficulty, and only when they reach the end of their rope, gather the strength of the nation, reverse the failures of the past, and move forward in unison toward the path of light can they truly revive. Japan is a good example. Reading the history of the Meiji Restoration, one will know this judgment is correct. He then recounted the experience of the Qing Domain of Japan, followed by saying that the national consciousness of revival that is revealed now, both above and below in our country, is truly exciting in its intensity and correctness. Public opinion is revealing an unprecedented great power, sweeping away abnormal thoughts and transgressive attempts. The conscience and abilities of the general public can be fully utilized and activated, invisibly forming a supreme authority, sufficient to supervise everything and correct everything. All the past unnecessary misunderstandings have been dispelled, and a new common trust and mutual trust have been established. All the construction undertakings of the country are moving towards the path of light under the leadership of our leader, the party, and the government, showing that our nation has the foundation for revival. In the past, our country's troops could not be fully unified under the central government due to accumulated habits, forming a situation of inflated quantity, weak quality, complex organization, inconsistent weapons, lack of equipment, and imprecise training. Since the September 18th Incident, the soldiers of the whole country have awakened, and the central government has been able to start military reorganization. The highest purpose of military reorganization is to unify military orders and military administration under the central government, that is, the so-called "nationalization of all troops." He then explained the meaning and principles of "nationalization," and briefly described the reorganization of the old Northeast Army. Finally, he mentioned the military reorganization of Sichuan and Kang, saying that Director Liu Fucheng and the military generals of Sichuan and Kang have clearly expressed their willingness to accept the central government's principles of military reorganization. Although the implementation steps are yet to be discussed in detail, since the generals have a clear understanding and expression, and military reorganization is a unanimous demand of the whole country, it is believed that the implementation will be smooth and rapid. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government held a memorial week on the morning of the 21st. Chairman Lin, Deng Jiayan, Lu Xunyong, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials of the National Government and various ministries and commissions, totaling about 400 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he reported on "How to Cultivate National Integrity." First, he explained the meaning of the four characters "national integrity," saying that "integrity" can mean righteousness and moral integrity. If a nation can fully develop this righteousness and moral integrity, making it universally penetrate into the hearts of every citizen, then it becomes national integrity. Therefore, national integrity is actually an expression of the national spirit, and is essential for the survival and development of a nation. He then explained the relationship between national integrity and the survival and development of a nation in great detail, and drew on historical examples from our country's history to prove the important influence of this spirit on domestic and foreign affairs. He continued by saying that to cultivate national integrity, we only need to grasp one premise, which is to value the life and interests of the country and the nation very highly, and to value individual life and interests very lightly. If we can grasp this premise, then we can fight and sacrifice for the interests of the country and the nation. Otherwise, if we only seek our own private interests, then when the country and nation are in danger, we will certainly not rise up to fight, or even harm the interests of the country and nation, to become traitors and rebels. Therefore, this understanding is the fundamental starting point for creating national integrity. When a nation has integrity, the survival and development of the nation will be guaranteed. He hoped that everyone would pay attention to and promote this issue, and start with themselves first, so that our nation can forever prosper and grow. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>The New Leader of the Indian National Movement, Nehru, Travels in Malaya</h3>
<p>— Wu Yisheng</p>
<p>Recent Situation of the Indian Independence Movement / The Aims of the Indian National Congress</p>
<p>Nehru, the new leader of the Indian national movement, has been working hard in the anti-British movement for more than ten years. This time, taking advantage of his vacation, he traveled with his beloved daughter to various parts of Malaya. On the morning of May 23, he arrived in Penang from Burma on the "Golia" ship, and on the 24th, he left Penang for Singapore along the Malayan Federal Railway via Parit Buntar, Taiping, Ipoh, and Kuala Lumpur, arriving in Singapore on the 25th. He made short stays in the above-mentioned four places along the way, receiving a warm welcome from Indian expatriates. Especially when he arrived in Singapore, more than 10,000 Indian expatriates, from gentry and wealthy businessmen to hawkers and peddlers, gathered at the train station, all wanting to catch a glimpse of the style of this national leader. After Nehru got off the train, he was tightly surrounded by the crowd, and even the glass of his watch was broken by the squeezing. The enthusiastic situation can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Since Nehru entered Malayan territory, all the English and Chinese newspapers have used large headlines to publish his remarks. The reporter used a summarizing method to make a general summary as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the recent situation of the Indian independence movement, he only gave a simple report: The Indian nation, like the Chinese nation, has a vast territory and a large population, but because it is a weak nation, an oppressed nation, India's past was very great, but now the Indian people are living a subhuman life, and all the people of India are in poverty. British financiers invest with silver, carrying out commercial exploitation, which is the reason for the poverty of the Indian people. Although the British government does not want India to exist in a state of poverty, it has no way to do so. The administrative organization of the Indian government is top-heavy and extremely expensive. Although India is the poorest country in the world, the salaries of some people in the country are the highest in the world. Therefore, under such circumstances, the Indian independence movement is an unstoppable work. In the past seventeen years, India has carried out three large-scale non-cooperation and disobedience movements. Even now, the tense situation still exists. We firmly believe that the complete independence of India can be expected to be realized, but it is not easy to predict when it will be realized, because the current international situation is changing very rapidly.</p>
<p>"What are the policies and objectives of the Indian National Congress?" An English newspaper reporter asked him. He eloquently explained: "The ultimate goal of the National Congress is to make India independent, but the autonomous states or autonomous territories in Asia and Africa, such as Canada, Newfoundland, and Australia, are completely independent. If India is permanently a dependency, its descendants will always be treated as slaves, and they will not be able to avoid it wherever they go. This is well known to the Indian people. Now, 75 to 80 percent of the people of India are members of the National Congress, and only a very small number do not sympathize with the National Congress. The new constitution of India is a hateful thing, and it is now being vehemently opposed and rejected by the Indian people. The British government, of course, is well aware that it cannot succeed."</p>
<p>Someone asked Nehru if he was opposed to the British. He strongly denied it. He said: "What I oppose is the British government in India, but not the British people. I oppose British imperialism, and I also oppose any imperialism, such as Germany and Japan, etc. Because the policy of the British Empire will never make India completely autonomous, as generous as giving gifts. If the Indian people want to be free, it will certainly not be as fast as many people imagine. They must increase the strength of the Indian people, so that Britain cannot resist the crowd, and then they can achieve complete independence. Imperialism cannot be compromised, so if you want national liberation, you should first eliminate imperialism!"</p>
<p>Someone also asked Nehru, saying that after India secedes from Britain, she will become the weak meat of other strong countries, such as Japan, which does not seem to be beneficial to India. Nehru immediately gave a very detailed answer. Nehru said: Although Japan is a strong country, accustomed to aggression, its domestic economic situation is extremely bad. Whether it can have the financial resources to invade India for a long time is, of course, a big problem; moreover, Japan is between the United States and the Soviet Union, and these two major countries will certainly not sit idly by and watch Japan seize India. Japan's neighboring major country is China. Although China is not strong, it is extremely hostile to Japan. Japan wants to completely rule China, but the result is still a failure. This is a good example. As for other powers, they really cannot rule India, because the balance of power of the powers has been formed. Even the small countries of the Balkans can be preserved due to the balance of power, let alone India. Therefore, the balance of power of the powers is the best guarantee that India will not be invaded after independence.</p>
<p>After Nehru finished speaking, someone expressed to Nehru that they did not approve of radical behavior. Nehru said that in today's world, it is really impossible to proceed slowly, because the whole world is rapidly changing and reforming. Nehru then solemnly declared that the future complete independence of India is not hostile to Britain. On the contrary, India wants to form a treaty with Britain for political and economic assistance. During the transition period, India will hire British experts of various kinds as much as possible to train the Indian people and make them advance, but these experts are completely under the control of the Indian government.</p>
<p>When Nehru was talking to reporters, he talked about Gandhi. Nehru said that Gandhi's greatness of personality is a leader he admires. Gandhi's statement of retirement is actually a physical expression, and his spirit will continue to struggle. Regarding the issue of the separation of India and Burma, he hoped that the people of India and Burma could always maintain the spirit of cooperation and friendship.</p>
<p>Finally, let me write a little about Nehru's criticism of Malaya. Nehru said: Malaya is a rich country, rich in mineral resources, and has many other reserves. The European unemployment crisis is surging, but Malaya has not been threatened. The financial situation in Malaya is excellent, so there is no political crisis. Because it is so stable, the public is also indifferent to any problems around the world. He has repeatedly reprimanded Indian expatriates in Malaya, saying that Indian expatriates in Malaya are scattered and unorganized, and also that Indian expatriates in Malaya ignore the serious situation in their motherland.</p>
<p>He expressed the following hope for Indian expatriates: The relationship between India and Malaya has been going on for nearly a thousand years. The local Indian expatriates should contact all ethnic groups in this country and work together for development. On the other hand, they should pay more attention to the problems of their motherland and provide financial or other assistance from time to time. Indian expatriates should especially cooperate with the Chinese to maintain friendship, because China is the most dynamic country in the world. China is progressing very fast at present, and it will be able to dominate the world in the near future, while India is still lagging behind, which cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Another thing that needs to be mentioned is that Nehru expressed a special welcome when he met with Chinese newspaper reporters. He said that during his trip, he saw Chinese schools standing everywhere in Burma and Malaya, well-managed, and the male and female students were energetic, which gave him a very deep impression. Before leaving, he said that today, the problems of China are not only the problems of China itself; the problems of India are also not only the problems of India, but belong to the world. He hoped that each other could understand this meaning.</p>
<p>As of the time the reporter sent the manuscript, Nehru was still in Johor, Muar, Malacca and other places in Malaya, receiving a warm welcome from Indian expatriates. Although he stated everywhere that the task of this trip was to travel and not to promote India here, in fact he was reviewing his strength and promoting the independence movement everywhere!

<h3>This Year's Epidemic Prevention Problem</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>The great flood in the Jianghuai region in the 20th year of the Republic of China. The following year, cholera spread, reaching more than 300 cities. From May to October, there were more than 100,000 patients and no less than 30,000 deaths. The local authorities then devoted all their efforts to large-scale prevention and treatment. As the weather gradually turned cold, the epidemic naturally stopped. Since then, preventive measures have been taken in advance every year. Even if epidemics are discovered, they are quickly suppressed and eliminated, and will not cause major disasters. In a corner of Shanghai, due to the cooperation of the Chinese and foreign authorities and the efforts of the epidemic prevention office, no genuine cholera has been found in recent years. This year, the hot summer is coming again. According to medical news, the spread of cholera is worrying. It is necessary to prepare for a rainy day. Now, please make a few remarks on the issue of epidemic prevention.</p>
<p>"Disease enters through the mouth." Epidemics are often like this. In the summer, if people eat and drink cleanly and regulate their daily lives, even if they feel unwell, they will be cured immediately. It is not easy for epidemics to invade. However, even this simple condition cannot be met by those with a little financial resources. The working masses go home after work and eat indiscriminately. The flies buzzing around their food utensils are all flies. In the evening, there are also smelly lice and mosquitoes disturbing their sweet dreams. The bad environment gives the germs a chance to attack. Once infected, they have no ability to treat it and let them die. They do not know how to disinfect, which leads to a wider spread until it is out of control. Therefore, to prevent epidemics, we must think from the perspective of the working class, and those who are responsible for health administration must have a warm charitable heart in order to prevent problems before they occur.</p>
<p>Epidemics have a cyclical nature, occurring every few years. Shanghai has been able to pass safely in the past few years due to effective prevention. Since there is a forecast that it will be rampant again this year, we should make more efforts in epidemic prevention. The preventive measures should be to advise the water companies to provide clean water free of charge so that the common people can drink it. Strictly inspect food and beverage shops, and strictly prohibit vendors from selling sliced fruits. Household garbage should be poured into buckets and not allowed to be littered on the ground. Violators will be heavily fined. Periodically spray the stagnant water in ditches and remote places with lime water or carbolic acid. In addition, organize mosquito and fly eradication teams to move out day and night in order to fundamentally eliminate the source of the epidemic. Citizens are greedy for coolness and sleep in the open at night, and the police should be ordered to dissuade them at any time. Cars for administering epidemic prevention injections should be passed through various urban areas to forcibly inject citizens in advance. Hospital beds in various epidemic hospitals should be expanded by soliciting donations from all walks of life so that the poor and sick can be treated free of charge. All of these are old sayings and are well known to the Chinese and foreign authorities. We do not hesitate to repeat them in order to promote the public's increased attention.</p>
<p>As for the situation in the interior, it should not be ignored. The sanitary knowledge of the people in the interior is mostly below the standard. The epidemic prevention funds in various counties are far less abundant than those in Shanghai. According to the impressions of our reporters traveling in the interior provinces, the city streets are mostly narrow, dirty, and smoky. The toilets in the corners of the walls are mostly breeding grounds for flies and maggots. At night, mosquitoes gather into cities and suck people's blood. The only source of water is the river. Local residents wash rice and vegetables on one side, and pour out toilet buckets on the other. The opportunity to infect germs through food and drink is extremely numerous. The villagers are ignorant, and when they encounter an epidemic, they only know to beg for the spirits and gods. Their foolishness is laughable, and their encounter is also sad. Therefore, the fundamental way to prevent epidemics in the interior is to organize propaganda teams to go deep into the countryside to tell them the source of the epidemic and basic sanitation knowledge. As for the epidemic prevention methods, specifically speaking, we must usually clear the accumulated dirt on the streets, dredge the river water, and strictly prohibit the dumping of dirt into the river channels. We should also solicit local philanthropists to purchase epidemic prevention equipment and administer epidemic prevention injections to the people. Set up temporary epidemic hospitals in public places to treat patients free of charge. These measures are easier to do. This year, various provinces in the Northwest, Southeast have reported droughts. Considering the ancient saying that there must be a major epidemic after a major disaster, we deeply hope that the local authorities will pay attention to the above points.</p>
<h3>A Political Upheaval Occurs in France, the Blum Cabinet, in Power for Only One Year, is Overthrown</h3>
<p>The Fiscal Full Powers Bill is a Fatal Blow / Audeau is Ordered to Try to Form a New Cabinet</p>
<p>[Paris] After the Senate rejected the compromise proposal submitted by the left-wing party delegations regarding the Fiscal Full Powers Bill last night, the government submitted its resignation at 2:25 a.m. today. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 21st)</p>
<p>[Paris] President Lebrun received Senator Audeau of the Radical Socialist Party at 7:30 this morning and ordered him to form a new cabinet. After a meeting of one and a half hours, Audeau expressed his acceptance in principle. After consulting with various parties, he will submit a concrete response to the President. Audeau then visited Senate President Jeanneney and House Speaker Herriot at 9:20 a.m. as usual, and met with Radical Socialist Party leader Daladier. At 11:00 a.m., he returned to the House to attend the Radical Socialist Party congressional caucus. Only after the meeting did he begin to contact the formation of a cabinet. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 21st)</p>
<p>[Paris] Audeau, who had previously served as Prime Minister and was a minister without portfolio in the Blum cabinet, has been ordered by the President to form a new cabinet. It is expected that Audeau will form a cabinet dominated by the Radical Socialist Party in order to divide the power of the Popular Front. However, whether the Socialist Party will agree is still uncertain. At the same time, the people have followed Blum's appeal and are calmly dealing with the political turmoil. Blum published an article saying that the Senate's rejection of the Full Powers Bill denied the government the power necessary to deal with the country's difficulties. The cabinet unanimously decided that although the House was loyal and unwavering, the Senate's rejection made it impossible for the government to carry out its objectives, so it submitted a full resignation. We now urgently appeal to all members of the Popular Front to remain calm about the political situation. For the benefit of the country, the transfer of power should be carried out calmly and in accordance with the laws of the Republic. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Great Shock in British Political Circles</h3>
<p>[London] After the news of the resignation of the Blum cabinet reached here, British political circles were greatly shocked, believing that Britain and France have the responsibility to maintain peace. At a time when the international situation urgently requires close contact between the two sides, political turmoil has occurred in France, which is regrettable. The foreign policy pursued by the Blum cabinet can maintain a linked relationship with Britain, and it is the only possible policy to prevent the division of European war. The extreme understanding between Britain and France was the greatest during Blum's administration. It is hoped that the foreign policy of the new French cabinet will remain the same as before, which would be a good thing. The social policy pursued by the Blum cabinet will surely be passed on permanently and will not be changed due to personnel changes. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Senate Rejects Financial Compromise</h3>
<p>Prime Minister's Final Appeal Fails to Reverse the Decline</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the Financial Plenary Powers Bill, the government had adopted a compromise proposal passed by representatives of the left-wing parties and submitted it to the Senate for discussion. The Senate ultimately rejected it by a vote of 168 to 96 and passed a new bill proposed by the Senate Finance Committee by a vote of 198 to 82. Before the vote was taken, Prime Minister Blum did not propose a vote of confidence but delivered a moving speech, saying that under the current circumstances, the government must retain "genuine plenary powers." After the vote results were announced, the Prime Minister immediately convened a cabinet meeting to discuss the actions the cabinet should take. Some people believe that the government will not propose a new bill, or may announce its resignation to the House of Representatives in the evening, which is not impossible. The following is a record of the Senate Finance Committee and Senate meetings:</p>
<p>The Senate Finance Committee met this afternoon to review the compromise proposal on financial plenary powers. As a result, it remained indifferent and drafted a new bill, adopting almost all the restrictions in the bill passed by the Senate yesterday. Its content advocates that the government's exercise of plenary powers should be limited to the following two purposes: first, to prohibit all acts that would harm public credit; and second, to maintain the price of the franc, without exceeding the scope of the monetary law of October 1, 1936, and to seek to revive finances and protect the interests of depositors. In addition, the government shall not take any restrictions on the circulation of gold, foreign exchange, and domestic and foreign securities, shall not issue compulsory bonds, and shall not change the current relationship between the Bank of France and the state (according to the compromise proposal, the last two points are not mentioned). The Senate then met at 10 p.m. First, Finance Committee rapporteur Cadot explained that according to the compromise proposal drafted by the representatives of the left-wing parties, the government could still issue compulsory bonds and change the current relationship between the Bank of France and the state, so the Senate could not consider it satisfactory. Finance Minister Olivar then took the floor, saying that he could not accept the new bill of the Finance Committee, "The pulse of our country's politics must not be controlled and manipulated by others, so as to harm our country's credit." Then, with a trembling voice, he spoke generously, saying that since he had been in charge of the Ministry of Finance, he had conscientiously performed his duties. Previously, when he signed a monetary agreement with the United Kingdom and the United States in September last year, he was seeking international cooperation. "If 'distrust' the government, it is not something I can accept. Even 'limited trust' is difficult to accept. I have fought for my ideals for many years and do not want to abandon them, and you cannot let me abandon them." Prime Minister Blum then also asked the Senate to pass the compromise proposal, saying that "the government we represent is a Popular Front government, and the majority of the Senate is not composed of Popular Front parties. In the past, because the Senate insisted on perfection, the government had to make concessions and change its actions. Now, the government's actions can achieve practical results, and the Senate has intensified its efforts to impose various restrictions on the Financial Plenary Powers Bill, which is inappropriate. "We are willing to continue to exist without seeking to collapse. The life of the cabinet is now in the hands of the Senate. If the cabinet cannot continue to exist, then there will be a great disaster in the future. How can you deal with the aftermath? Since the current cabinet took office a year ago, its achievements have been remarkable, and the enactment of various social laws and the revival of finance are its most important achievements. Furthermore, whether the Senate now wants to overturn the various laws that have been passed, or wants to change the organization of the majority party, and completely change the relationship between the current cabinet and the labor groups, will be decided by today's vote, and what the consequences will be, please pay attention to it." Finally, Finance Committee Chairman Caillaux gave a brief speech, and the Senate held a vote, and by a large majority rejected the compromise proposal, and maintained the original proposal put forward by the Senate Finance Committee.

<h3>Popular Front Joint Conference</h3>
<p>Representatives of Various Parties Attend</p>
<p>[Paris] After the cabinet resigned, the Popular Front Joint Committee held a meeting at 11 a.m. this morning. Representatives of various parties belonging to the Popular Front, celebrities, and representatives of various cultural, political, and labor groups participated in the discussion.

<h3>London Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>Unaffected by French Cabinet Tide</p>
<p>[London] London is taking the overthrow of the Blum government calmly. Even the foreign exchange market, which is most directly related, is only expressing the usual surprise as any other government overthrow. The foreign exchange market is currently taking a wait-and-see attitude, so it is easy for the French and British authorities to maintain the price of 110.90 spot francs on Saturday and Sunday of last week. The discount rate for forward francs is higher, which is enough to be a sign of uneasiness, but there are few buyers and sellers do not want to pressure the market, so transactions are very small. Currently, the discount rate for forward francs is 3 francs for one month and 5 francs for three months. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>[Paris] General Beck, Chief of Staff of the German Army, who came to France to visit a few days ago, took a train back to Berlin at 7:15 this evening. The matter was kept strictly secret, and few people outside knew about it. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Konoe Resolves to Reform the House of Peers</h3>
<p>Reduce the Number of Seats, Recruit Talents</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to the opinion of today's political observers, Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro's announcement of a severe reform of the House of Peers is actually a desperate measure. Although the Prime Minister's reform plan will cause disturbances in the House of Peers, the House will have no choice but to revise the peerage system itself. However, the Prime Minister obviously has a firm will to carry out severe reforms of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives at the same time. Observers now believe that the Prime Minister intends to implement parliamentary reform on the one hand, and to ensure that the five-year industrial plan of Japan and Manchukuo is completed. The Prime Minister aims to revise the election law greatly and revitalize the political parties, so as to complete the necessary reform of the House of Representatives. As for the reform of the House of Peers, according to the Chugai Commercial News today, the bill will be submitted when the Diet convenes its regular session in December of this year. It is said that the Prime Minister intends to reduce the more than 410 seats in the House of Peers to 300 seats, one-third of which will be elected by the peers themselves, and the remaining half will be appointed by the Emperor with specialists, and half will be elected or recommended on the basis of occupational representation. The hereditary peerage system will be abolished. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Pan-Manchurian Consular Conference</h3>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Personnel to Attend</p>
<p>[Changchun] Hanafusa and Sato, two section chiefs specially dispatched by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attend the Pan-Manchurian Consular Conference, arrived in Changchun at 10 p.m. last night. Hanafusa said to people, "We are here to attend the Pan-Manchurian Consular Conference and investigate the implementation of the treaty on the transfer of taxation rights, so as to provide a reference for the future abolition of consular jurisdiction and police administration rights. The joint central and local conference held in Tokyo earlier to discuss the abolition of extraterritoriality proceeded smoothly and achieved satisfactory results, so the abolition can be implemented within this year. We intend to take advantage of this opportunity to come to Manchuria to discuss with the Manchukuo authorities the Japan-"Manchukuo" judicial assistance treaty and other related matters."

<h3>Siam Orders Three New Warships from Japan Completed</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The three Siamese patrol ships "Kreungya," "Takbai," and "Kantan," which were completed at the Ishikawa Island Shipyard, were handed over today at the Asagayajima Shipyard. Siamese Minister to Japan Raksha, Vice Minister of the Navy Shimada, and other related persons attended the ceremony. The three ships are scheduled to set sail for Yokohama on the morning of the 23rd, and will join the warships "Dajin" and "Meklong," which were completed at the Uraga Shipyard. All of them will sail to Siam on the 25th. (Dohmei dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Problem of Auctioning Mortgaged Property in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Question Raised in British House of Commons</p>
<p>[London] The British House of Commons discussed the problem of auctioning mortgaged property in Shanghai today. The matter was first raised by Conservative MP Milner, because of a recent decision by the Chinese Judicial Yuan that the auction of property, without the permission of the court, must be executed without objection from the debtor or a third party. Milner said that this decision would allow mortgagees who did not fulfill their debts to delay the execution of the mortgage without a proper reason. Milner asked the government to take appropriate remedial measures. Foreign Secretary Eden has agreed to investigate the matter in order to consider whether to take any measures.

<h3>Politicians from Various Countries Gather in Washington, D.C., a Prelude to Adjusting the World Economy</h3>
<p>Belgian Prime Minister Zeland and Chinese Finance Minister Kung Arrive in Washington. D.C. Brazilian Finance Minister Meets with President Roosevelt</p>
<p>[Washington, D.C.] The fact that Chinese Finance Minister Dr. Kung Hsiang-hsi and Brazilian Finance Minister Costa are visiting the United States at the same time, and that Belgian Prime Minister Zeland will also meet with President Roosevelt, has attracted the attention of the general public here. Costa is scheduled to meet with Roosevelt tomorrow. Whether the gathering of financial authorities from Asia, Europe, and the Americas in Washington, D.C., will lead to a readjustment of financial and economic relations among countries around the world has aroused outside speculation. The current situation is reminiscent of the scene before the World Economic Conference, when politicians from various countries gathered. The Chinese and Brazilian finance ministers have always paid attention to relations with the United States. (Kuo Min News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>[Washington, D.C.] After Belgian Prime Minister Zeland arrived here yesterday, the Belgian Ambassador told the press that although the Prime Minister had been entrusted by the governments of the United Kingdom and France to investigate ways to remove international trade barriers in order to restore normal commercial relations among European countries, this was not the goal of the trip. Prime Minister Zeland will discuss the war debt issue with President Roosevelt on the 23rd of this month. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Former Advisor to the U.S. Treasury Department Publishes an Article</h3>
<p>Warns the Government Not to Unilaterally Depreciate Gold Prices</p>
<p>[Washington, D.C.] The Foreign Policy Association today published a report containing an article by Brad, a former economic advisor to the Treasury Department, warning the United States against unilaterally reducing gold prices. He said that it may be feasible to establish an international agreement to reduce gold prices, but unilateral action may cause deflation and lower the prices of American goods in the international market. If there is no consultation with other countries beforehand, this unilateral action will also undermine the Anglo-American-French monetary agreement, disrupt the relationship between the dollar and foreign currencies, and cause countries to depreciate their currencies. Reducing gold prices will psychologically reduce prices, which will greatly hit business. Therefore, gold prices can only be reduced appropriately within the scope of the trilateral monetary agreement without affecting exchange rates. In theory, this method can avoid the adverse effects of deflation, but in fact prices will inevitably be affected. The British Dominions will oppose reducing gold prices, because gold mines in the British Dominions are currently making profits, and gold has become an important item in their balance of international payments. The United States does not appear to be changing its gold policy on the surface, but foreign gold is flowing into the United States in a steady stream, and it will have to take action within the scope of the trilateral monetary agreement sooner or later to prevent it.

<h3>Japanese Delegation Arrives in England from the United States</h3>
<p>Commercial Negotiations to Begin Next Month</p>
<p>[London] A 24-member Japanese economic delegation led by Monno Shigekuro arrived here today via the United States. The delegation will first go to Berlin for about eight days, and then return to London to begin commercial negotiations with the Anglo-Japanese Trade Group of the Federation of British Industries. According to informed sources, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and Japan will soon begin with the Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Yoshida Shigeru, and the British Foreign Office. Talks between members of the Japanese trade delegation and key figures in British industry will be sufficient to facilitate the negotiations between the United Kingdom and Japan, but their nature will still be informal.

<h3>Trans-Arctic Flight Between the U.S. and Russia a Success</h3>
<p>Possibility of Opening a Regular Air Route Confirmed Authorities of Both Countries Send Congratulatory Telegrams to the Three Heroes</p>
<p>Portland, Oregon, USA The three Soviet aviators Chkalov, Belyakov, and Belyakov have now completed their magnificent flight of 5,500 miles across the Arctic. They landed today at Vancouver Barracks in Washington State, about 550 miles from their destination, Oakland, California. The three took off from Moscow at 2 p.m. (Greenwich Mean Time) on Friday and arrived at Vancouver Barracks at 4:22 p.m. today, flying for 50 hours and 22 minutes. Most of the route was over the ice of the Arctic Ocean. The success of this flight has shown the possibility of a new air route across the Arctic sky. The Soviet Union attempted to fly over the Arctic in 1935, but failed due to slight damage to the aircraft. This time, they actually achieved a groundbreaking record, and the possibility of establishing a regular commercial aviation business between the Soviet Union and the Americas was also confirmed. After landing, Chkalov told a Reuters reporter that his plane flew very well. They landed only because the visibility was poor. There was still plenty of fuel in the plane, enough to continue flying 750 miles. If the weather had been good, they could have flown directly to their destination, Oakland. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet party and government leaders Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Kalinin, Zhdanov, Yezhov, Mikoyan, and Andreev jointly telegraphed the three aviators to congratulate them, saying, "We warmly congratulate you on your glorious victory. The completion of the Moscow-Arctic-America direct flight has made all Soviet workers admire and love you. We are very honored to have such heroic aviators who are not afraid of hardships and do their best to complete their missions. We warmly shake hands with you." (TASS dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>[Moscow] After the completion of the Moscow-America direct flight, the Soviet Union celebrated. That night, workers on the night shift in factories held a meeting to celebrate, which was very grand. Workers at the Moscow Dynamo Factory declared, "Let the employers of the traitors see how great the latent power of our country is. At any time, hundreds of millions of Soviet patriots will rise up to defend the socialist motherland." (TASS dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>[Washington, D.C.] President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull both telegraphed the Soviet aviators to congratulate them on the success of their direct flight from Moscow to the United States. The Soviet Embassy in Washington recently issued a statement saying that the Northeast Air Route, after ten years of arduous preparation, such as exploration, mapping, climate research, and the establishment of a radio network, has now been opened up and can be used for commercial purposes. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Vancouver The three Russian aviators had smiles on their faces when they got off the plane, but because they did not know English, they asked for interpreters to help them ask for food and drink and a place to bathe. Mrs. Marshall, the wife of the commander of the airfield, Major General, gave them ham and eggs, which they said was the first time they had eaten cooked food in three days. The water they carried during the flight had frozen into ice, and they chewed ice to drink when they were thirsty. As soon as they passed the Arctic, they notified the U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Troyanovsky, so Troyanovsky also arrived here today and personally delivered Stalin's congratulatory telegram to the three. At the same time, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull also sent congratulatory telegrams. The famous Arctic explorer Stephenson even called it an unprecedented success in the history of aviation. The plane is now being properly guarded by the army to prevent curious people from taking away parts as souvenirs. According to the aviators, they plan to hire another plane to continue flying to San Francisco, and the original plane will be dismantled and transported to Soviet Russia. San Francisco is ready to welcome them formally. (Kuo Min News Agency, 20th)</p>

<p>Tokyo Correspondence</p>
<h3>Talking About the Konoe Cabinet</h3>
<p>— Nagumo</p>
<p>May 31, the Hayashi Cabinet resigned en masse. June 1, the order to form the "Konoe Cabinet" was issued. June 4, the Konoe Cabinet was formally established. The temporarily unstable Japanese political situation has thus temporarily entered a state of "harmony."</p>
<p>In the late stage of the Saito Cabinet, there were already rumors of the "Konoe Cabinet." During the "February 26th Incident," the atmosphere of the "Konoe Cabinet" was also very strong. Since then, when the Hirota Cabinet stepped down and the Ugaki Cabinet failed, the Japanese government and the public had unanimously hoped that Konoe would come forward. However, the handsome young nobleman Konoe finally hesitated and waited, unwilling to easily fall into the political torrent, lest he accidentally "messed up" and lowered his prestige. "After a thousand calls, he finally came out," the Konoe Cabinet has this kind of "style."</p>
<p>Sure enough, it is different after all. On the first day of forming the cabinet, the problem of retaining Army Minister Sugiyama was easily resolved, and then the problem of retaining Navy Minister Yonai was also satisfactorily resolved on the second day. Nakajima Kumakichi, a Seiyukai party member who was a minister of railways, and Nagai Ryutaro, a Minseito party member who was a minister of railways, were both pro-military figures related to the New Party movement. Although they were not approved by the presidents of the two parties, but appointed by Konoe in their individual capacities to join the cabinet, it was still considered a perfunctory attempt to preserve the "face" of the political parties.</p>
<p>Regarding the resignation of Ikeda Seihin, the agent of the Mitsui zaibatsu and the president of the Bank of Japan, the cabinet formation headquarters, on the morning of the ___th, had already asked Ariga Nagabumi, the former managing director of Mitsui Gomei and Ikeda's senior, to contact Ikeda. The result of the contact was: "Whether to resign or not depends on the selection of the successor to the Minister of Finance." It is of course said that the successor to the Minister of Finance must be able to guarantee the interests of Mitsui, and then the financial capital power of Mitsui can cooperate with the Konoe Cabinet.</p>
<p>The new Minister of Finance, Kaya Okinori, was recommended by the Minister of Finance of the Hayashi Cabinet, Yuki Toyotaro. Kaya Okinori is only 49 years old this year, but he has been working in the Ministry of Finance for 25 years. When he was the director of the Budget Bureau and the director of the Budget and Settlement Division, he was able to conduct extremely detailed reviews of the huge budgets submitted by various ministries each year. Therefore, in the Ministry of Finance, he is known as the "God of Budget." In the past, his financial plan advocated a steady pace to follow Takahashi's sound financial policy during the Okada Cabinet, but now, of course, there will be changes.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of June 3, after Kaya agreed to take office as Minister of Finance, he visited Yuki to request assistance. At the same time, he also visited Ikeda, hoping that Ikeda could give him great support. Although he was unable to meet Ikeda in person, it is said that he has been able to dispel the intention to resign.</p>
<p>At the first cabinet meeting after the ceremony of his appointment on the afternoon of the 4th, Prince Konoe said, "I intend to ease the domestic opposition." However, in Japan today, where social contradictions have become acute, "opposition" is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Thanks to the thorough support of the military, Baba Eiichi, who compiled the unprecedented budget during the Hirota Cabinet era, has again joined the cabinet as Minister of Home Affairs. At the same time, the military also expressed its intention to have Baba concurrently serve as the president of the Planning Board. Baba's appearance frightened some of the established forces, the powerful zaibatsu. The positions of these zaibatsu and the newly emerging military-industrial zaibatsu are incompatible. The capital of the newly emerging military-industrial zaibatsu is relatively weak, and they do not have great power in the overseas market. The only way to accumulate capital and develop capital is to rely on the development of the domestic military-industrial industry. No matter how large the amount of raw materials for the military-industrial industry is imported, no matter how unbalanced the national income and expenditure is, no matter how much the light industry sector is persecuted, as long as the military-industrial industry is prosperous, it is beneficial to them.</p>
<p>The powerful established zaibatsu operate both heavy industry and military-industrial industry, but also operate the light industry sector. In order to defend the markets they have already seized overseas, they must constantly send out their products. What exportable goods can the military-industrial industry produce? Moreover, Japan is a raw material importing country, and the textile industry is the backbone of Japanese capitalism. However, cotton and wool need to be imported from foreign countries. Baba's attempt to prevent the deterioration of the balance of international payments and restrict the import of raw materials for light industry will of course affect light industry and prevent the progress of Japanese foreign trade. The inevitable increase in the budget only directly increases the suffering of the masses, and does not harm the interests of the zaibatsu themselves. The biggest cause of disputes is the contradiction of interests between the zaibatsu.</p>
<p>The budget revised by Yuki was not much better than Baba's original budget proposal. However, Baba was criticized and forced to step down, while Yuki had a lot of "face," because the financial power of the Japanese zaibatsu exceeds the capital of the newly emerging military-industrial capital.</p>
<p>Because people believe that the Konoe Cabinet is a strong cabinet that will further harmonize the military, political parties, and zaibatsu, the financial market, which had been depressed since May, suddenly became active, and many stocks of the Mitsui and Mitsubishi systems clearly rose in price (Yomiuri, June 3). After the news that Baba joined the cabinet and concurrently served as the president of the Planning Board was released, the economic situation suddenly became depressed again, which is what Japanese newspapers call "financial circles' vigilance."</p>
<h3>Western Rebel Army Establishes Provisional Government in Bilbao</h3>
<p>Orders Martial Law Declared, Germany and Italy Send Telegrams of Congratulations</p>
<p>Bilbao: The Nationalist army established a provisional government here today. General Dávila, commander of the Northern Route Army, has appointed Colonel Farin as acting military governor and Lico as civil administrator. Immediately after taking office, Farin ordered the declaration of martial law. According to aerial reconnaissance reports, the main force of the Basque army is retreating westward. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>[Berlin] After the port of Bilbao was captured by the Nationalist army, German Führer Hitler sent a telegram to General Franco, leader of the Nationalist government, to congratulate him. General Franco replied with a telegram of thanks. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Upon receiving the report that General Franco, leader of the Spanish Nationalist army, had occupied Bilbao, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini immediately sent him a congratulatory telegram, stating that the recapture of Bilbao was a great step towards the victory of nationalism, and that the Italian people and government were deeply delighted by the news. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Andai: A Spanish journalist, following the first vanguard of the Nationalist army into the city of Bilbao, recently detailed the circumstances of the Nationalist army's occupation of the city, saying that he saw almost no one on the thoroughfares, only occasional glimpses of people peeking from behind windows. It was not until the Nationalist army reached the arsenal that many people cheered for the victorious army and raised their arms in fascist salutes. The headquarters of the Basque government, the city hall, and the Ministry of Interior were all taken over by personnel sent by the Nationalist army, without any bloodshed. Residents gradually gathered in the bustling areas of the city, while Nationalist army aircraft circled in the sky. It is not yet known how many Basque soldiers were captured in the city, but it is estimated that since the beginning of the siege, the number of captured has reached about 18,000. In the evening, military trucks entered the city, loaded with bread and food to supply the residents. The city had been without water for four days, but now the supply has returned to normal. Commander-in-chief Franco has instructed the troops not to take any retaliatory actions. Except for six bridges that were blown up by anarchists, the material damage in the city is far less than initially expected. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Bilbao: The rebel army has completely occupied the Basque capital today. A column of tanks has crossed the pontoon bridge over the Nervión River. In the distance, the faint sound of gunfire can be heard, the dying echoes of the government army retreating into the nearby mountains. An Associated Press reporter entered the city via the Talio Road, which was so congested with military vehicles and equipment that many refugees on both sides embraced and kissed the soldiers entering the city. The reporter was escorted by two rebel officers. Upon reaching the Beunos Aeres Bridge, they encountered 200 militiamen who shouted "Long live Spain!" and embraced the reporters as if they were fellow countrymen. Several houses in the city remained intact, such as the British Consulate and the British South American Bank. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>Bilbao: The ironworks and other factories in Bilbao have not suffered significant damage. The ironworks were still working as usual a few days ago. The iron ore mines southwest of Bilbao were only shut down for a few days. Because the supply of coal is still sufficient, the Bilbao power plant can be restored to operation immediately. The Deusto arsenal can produce 40,000 rounds of ammunition per day and will also resume operation. The Nibar arsenal has not stopped working. (National Marine Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<h3>Four-Nation Consultation on German Warship Bombing Incident</h3>
<p>Britain and France Express Difficulty in Accepting German Proposals</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the attack on the German cruiser "Leipzig" off the coast of Oran in French Algeria, British Foreign Secretary Eden consulted with the German, French, and Italian ambassadors all day today, but no compromise has been reached. The current political situation in France is unstable, so a solution may be difficult to achieve for the time being. According to unconfirmed reports, Germany will demand that Britain, France, and Italy join Germany in protesting to the Spanish government. In addition, it is also proposed that the navies of the four countries should hold a demonstration off the coast of a certain port belonging to the Spanish Republican government, in order to show solidarity and prevent such incidents from happening again. However, the British and French governments find it difficult to accept this German proposal. The reasons for this are: ㊀ There is no material evidence to support the attack on the "Leipzig"; ㊁ The Spanish Republican government is recognized by the British civil government and the French Popular Front government, and it is impossible to accept a demonstration by its navy off the coast of the Republican government; ㊂ The Republican government has firmly denied all the allegations made by the German side. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>Bombing of Danish Defense Minister's Villa</h3>

Andersen was not at the villa at the time, and his wife and daughter were still asleep, also unharmed, as the bomb exploded in the garden. The perpetrator fled immediately. It is believed that the bomber was dissatisfied with the new defense law implemented yesterday, which dissolved the volunteer corps. (National Marine Telegraph, 21st)</p>

<h3>Japan Controls Northeast Economic Plan</h3>
<p>With Shenyang's Industry and Commerce as the Center, Inducing Japanese Capitalists to Invest, 47 Factories Already Established</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Shenyang is the hub of Japanese industry and commerce in the Northeast and controls the economic center of the entire Northeast. In recent years, the consumption of Japanese goods in Shenyang has exceeded 2.5 million tons per year. As a result, the establishment of Japanese factories in Shenyang has gradually increased. The capital of large Japanese department stores has increased, and small commodity stores have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Currently, there are 34 Japanese trade associations in Shenyang, including the Fengtian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Fengtian Industrial Association Federation, the Store Association, the Manchurian Industrial Association, the Fengtian Tiexi Association, and the Fengtian Import Association Trade Union. These organizations are further cooperating to expand Japan's industrial and commercial power in the Northeast, in order to develop what they see as the "treasure house of East Asia." The Japanese also believe that it has a special relationship with Japanese national policy. The leaders of the Japanese industrial and commercial circles and factories in Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Liaoyang, and other places have organized the Manchurian Industrial Association as the first authoritative industrial organization in the Northeast. The association's address is located at 8 Qingye Town, Shenyang City, and it is named the Manchurian Industrial Association, a corporate legal entity. The purpose of the association is to attract Japanese capitalists and industrialists to invest in and develop industry in pseudo-Fengtian. In addition to the Industrial Association, there is also the pseudo-Fengtian Land Co., Ltd., organized by the South Manchuria Railway and the pseudo-Fengtian Public Office, with a capital of 5.5 million pseudo-currency. The area of land it manages is more than 3.25 million ping. The land managed by the pseudo-company is entirely for capitalists to invest in and open factories in pseudo-Fengtian. Currently, there are 47 factories that have already started construction, including 3 beer factories, 7 sake factories, 2 chemical factories, 2 dyeing factories, 2 rice polishing factories, 4 shoe factories, 3 rubber factories, 12 iron factories, and 2 others. The Japanese believe that their hopes for the industrial and commercial development of the entire Northeast in pseudo-Fengtian are limitless.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Arrives in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Developing Hainan Island Based on Domestic Capital, Streamlining Guangdong's Finances After Detailed Investigation</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council, came south this time with the mission of planning Hainan Island and conducting a detailed investigation of Guangdong's financial and fiscal affairs. On the 17th, after arriving in Hong Kong on the Queen of Asia, he rested in Hong Kong for one night. On the morning of the 18th, he took the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway flower car to Guangzhou. In advance, provincial and municipal authorities and important military, political, and party personnel went to the Da Sha Tou Railway Station to welcome him and sent military police to guard him. Zhu's flower car arrived at the station at 11:40. Those who came with him included Chen Xing, Bei Songsun, Dai Mingli, Jiang Weixian, Chen Kangqi, and Guangxi representative Qu Shounian. After Song got off the car, he shook hands with Yu Hanmou, Wu Tiecheng, Luo Zhuoying, Xu Chongqing, and others to pay his respects. Then he took a car with Yu and Wu to the Yingbin Hotel in the city. Provincial and municipal officials went to visit one after another. Then Yu and Wu accompanied Song to the Taiping Restaurant on Yonghan North Road for lunch. Dozens of provincial and municipal officials were present, and they dispersed at 12:00. At around 1:00 in the afternoon, Song drove to visit Yu and Wu. They discussed Guangdong's finances, finance, and the development plan for Hainan Island. According to Song's opinion, the development of Hainan Island should proceed simultaneously in terms of building the Hainan Island Railway, reclaiming wasteland, mining, developing fisheries, opening forests, and building ports, without emphasizing any one aspect. In the future, a responsible organization will be formed to implement the entire plan. As for funding, in addition to government investment, those in the business community and overseas Chinese who go to operate are also welcome. The government will give the compatriots and the business community considerable rights and be responsible for protection. Investment should be based on domestic capital. As for opening ports, Ma Niao Port should be opened first to facilitate navigation and accommodate large ships. Secondly, regarding Guangdong's economy, including the streamlining of financial and fiscal affairs, a countermeasure will be determined after investigating the actual situation and conducting careful consideration. In addition, the Guangxi authorities have repeatedly telegraphed me to welcome me. I will visit the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou after inspecting Hainan Island. At that time, I may take a detour to visit Guangxi, but it has not yet been decided. (June 18th)</p>
<h3>Jieyang Detains Itinerant Monk Who Poisoned Well</h3>
<p>Wandering Vagrants and White Russian Spies Repeatedly Discovered in the Interior</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Four years ago, there were rumors in the Chaozhou-Meizhou area that vagrants were poisoning wells, causing panic in various villages. Each village sent strong men to guard the drinking water wells and did not allow strangers to approach the wells. Several suspects were detained. This spring, there were widespread rumors that salt had been poisoned by traitors. Two salt factories in Raoping City were sealed by the county government because crystalline substances were found in the salt, and the salt was sent to Guangzhou for chemical testing. The testing showed that it was salt frost, and the public's doubts were dispelled. Recently, the situation in Shantou has been tense and relaxed, and vagrants, White Russians, and other spies have been discovered everywhere. Various rumors have become popular again. On the 18th, two itinerant monks were suddenly discovered in Xiachaizhai Village, Honggou Township, the third district of Jieyang County, kneeling down and chanting scriptures in the countryside, attracting the attention of the villagers. In the evening, when there were few pedestrians in the village, the monks dropped a paper package of medicine into the well. The well water immediately changed, with gas like boiling water rising to the surface. The villagers saw this and immediately detained the two monks and sent them to the police sub-bureau of the third district for interrogation to investigate who instigated the poisoning of the well.</p>

<p>Salt workers from the coastal area around the Yusan Temple in Weiling Dongxiang have been in dispute with Zhang Hanting, a local gentry from Henghe Township, over the salt mounds since last winter. After submitting a petition to the county government to send personnel to investigate, they gathered more than 100 people on the 19th of last month to go to the city to petition, asking the county government to stop it. Unexpectedly, Zhang Hanting continued to build the mounds, and the salt workers' attempts to stop him were ineffective. Therefore, at 11:00 a.m. on the 16th, they gathered 180 people again to file a second petition, requesting the county government to take measures to stop him first.

<h3>Interview Reporters' First Gathering: Minister Shao on Reporter's Cultivation</h3>
<p>"Record Everything Heard" Must Be Judged and Relayed to Readers; Pan Gongzhan Hopes to "Conceal Evil and Promote Good" to Change Customs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Interview Reporters Association held its first gathering yesterday at 2 PM at Bansong Garden. At the same time, the elected executive and supervisory committee members were sworn in. Fifty members attended, and Shao Lizi, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Chen Kecheng, Secretary of the Municipal Government, and Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, were invited to attend and provide guidance. Chen Wanli presided over the ceremony. After the formalities, Minister Shao, Director Pan, and Chen and Mao delivered speeches in succession. Then, the executive and supervisory committee members took office, with Mao Yun administering the oath. Various manufacturers donated exquisite items for a raffle to add to the enjoyment. The gathering ended at 5 PM. The speeches of Shao and Pan are recorded below.</p>
<p>Minister Shao's Address</p>
<p>After Chairman Chen Wanli reported the purpose of the meeting, Shao Lizi, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, delivered an address, saying, "Comrades, I am delighted to have the opportunity to participate in your association's gathering and meet with you all. As practical workers in the news industry, I am especially pleased that you have asked me to contribute my opinions. However, as I have a meeting at Fudan University this afternoon, I must attend and cannot stay longer, which I deeply regret. I apologize to all of you. You comrades are engaged in interview work in the news industry, and its importance is well understood by you. You are 'fighters on the first line of defense in the news industry.' You also understand that news reports must go through many departments before reaching readers, providing them with spiritual sustenance. The most important part is the interview. You also understand that 'news' is a summary of the most recent events in society that arouse the interest of the majority, and it is even better if it is what readers need most. We should provide readers with this information in the fastest way possible. This responsibility rests entirely with the interview reporters. Therefore, interview comrades work harder than anyone else. Ordinary people have fixed times for sleeping and eating, but interview reporters do not. To ensure the accuracy and speed of news, they must work extra hard. However, to ensure accuracy, in addition to 'recording everything heard,' they must also have the ability to 'judge.' Sometimes, the source of the news presents the opposite side of the facts, which we must carefully select. Some news sources have historical connections, so we must know their past 'history.' Therefore, we must also have 'preparation,' 'experience,' and 'knowledge' to be competent. To make the news interesting to readers, we must use vivid language to describe it in the report. If we encounter something particularly interesting, we must 'grasp' it to arouse the reader's interest in the same news. Interview reporters, due to the nature of their work, have to contact various sectors of society, so they must also have 'cultivation' to make the other party happy. Currently, various industries are striving to make progress, and if you comrades work hard at all times, you will surely gain the sympathy of society, and at the same time, you can also get comfort. However, individual efforts progress more slowly than 'joint research,' 'mutual learning,' and 'mutual supervision.' Therefore, the establishment of your association and the holding of gatherings are very meaningful. News reporters must value themselves to be valued by others. Occasionally, a few people may despise themselves, causing damage to the majority. A few people have a bad impression on society, and we should 'tell' and 'persuade' them, unintentionally benefiting each other. Therefore, it is especially necessary for interview reporters themselves to organize. Therefore, I am particularly pleased to hear of the establishment of your association and hope that each member will focus on the group so that the group has strength. I have not done interview work, but I have worked in editing and business, so my suggestions may be somewhat out of touch. I remember when I worked for the Minli Daily in the first year of the Republic of China, I wrote a column called 'Shanghai Chunqiu,' discussing the news industry with readers. However, at that time, the organization of each newspaper was simpler, with no field reporters or news agencies, only a few 'court reporters' or 'commercial reporters.' Therefore, sometimes I had to go out to work. Once, Sun Yat-sen came to Shanghai, and various groups invited him to speak at Zhang's Garden on 'The Principle of People's Livelihood.' At that time, few Chinese people understood Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, and it was the first time he spoke on the Principle of People's Livelihood. This issue was what all sectors of the country wanted to know most. I was not skilled in shorthand, but because the matter was important, I had to take on the task of recording it. Because the speech was very important, I had to 'record it all without changing a word.' Fortunately, Sun Yat-sen spoke very logically, and I did my best to record it, from 4 PM to 6 PM, for more than two hours. The next day, because the text was too long, it was published in two or three installments. This incident can be said to be an interview reporter at that time. When I recall it today, I still have a deep impression. I finished organizing it that day and returned to the newspaper to compile the local news column. The fatigue was no less than the hard work of all of you comrades today, but I was very comforted spiritually and forgot my hard work. Later, readers sent letters of welcome, and I felt that I had fulfilled my duty as a journalist and was comforted by it. From this, I believe that for important speeches or remarks, we should not lose the speaker's original intention and disclose it as much as possible. From this, I think of a recent incident that comrades have a small regret about. Recently, Nanjing held Ma Xiangbo's 98th birthday celebration, which was unprecedented. There were very interesting speeches at the time, and many foreign reporters stationed in Beijing participated. From the standpoint of 'journalism,' the grand event was very interesting. However, the next day, there was nothing special in the newspapers in the capital. Later, a Mr. TASS met me and said that he had intended to refer to the interesting materials in the newspapers and write a systematic report to send to the Soviet Union, but he gave up because there were no reference materials in the newspapers, which he deeply regretted. Therefore, I see that the daily newspapers in various parts of China have formed a 'formulaic' appearance. Any news, no matter how big or small, is recorded in roughly the same way. Due to the relationship of status, many important news items are also omitted. For example, recently, 'Chairman Chiang's talks with students going to the countryside in the summer vacation' were not fully published in the Beijing newspapers. This is not the responsibility of the 'interview reporter' or the 'editing comrade,' but is probably squeezed out due to printing reasons. However, this situation is worth discussing and improving. Because most of you are news agency reporters, there is more room for development. However, at this stage, news agencies themselves have many external difficulties, which cannot be eliminated by spiritual struggle and personal struggle. There may be places where they are underestimated. Therefore, we should pay special attention and work harder to make people value us. When talking to people, we must consider the impact on society, the impact on the speaker, and the impact on the event. If the speaker does not want the talk to be published, we will publish it casually, which will inevitably affect society and our own duties. Therefore, if the phrase 'record everything heard' is hung as a motto in the news industry, then the news industry will have no news to report, because there is a lot of news in society. Why do we only pick one or two items to publish without considering other societies? We will also blame us for the 'record everything heard' being too narrow and abandon us. Because there are many events that happen in society, but newspapers record very little. Therefore, the four words 'record everything heard' must be judged by ourselves. I think a news reporter is like a camera. Society is like a large scenic area. Several people take pictures, and they must consider the interests of the country, society, and themselves. Therefore, you comrades must have extra 'cultivation' in your duties. Some people may lack cultivation due to lack of time to read newspapers and books in their duties. I also hope that they will work hard to read more books. All of you are very 'dear,' so I hope you will forgive my messy words."</p>
<p>Director Pan's Address</p>
<p>Director Pan said in his address, "I am very honored to participate in your association's gathering today. I was unable to attend your association's founding meeting last time because I went to Beijing on business, which I deeply regret. Taking this opportunity to meet, I would like to briefly contribute my personal thoughts. Minister Shao has given detailed instructions on the news profession, especially the work of interview reporters, based on his past experience in the news industry. You should be able to understand its meaning and put it into practice. I would like to add two points, hoping that you will work hard: ㊀ 'Be diligent in work and cautious in speech.' This is the saying of ancient philosophers, which is most suitable for the work of interview reporters. Interviewing for news is like a war, competing for speed. Even a few minutes cannot be neglected, and even sleep and food can be forgotten. This is diligence in work. However, after obtaining the news, we should consider how to publish it. This is caution in speech. The examples cited by Minister Shao in his speech show the importance of caution in speech. However, caution in speech is generally thought to be what commentators and editors should pay attention to. In fact, interview reporters should pay even more attention. ㊁ 'Conceal evil and promote good.' Newspapers are reading materials for the public, so they have a great impact on society. Reporters should pay attention to the impact on the entire society when interviewing and writing articles, not just focusing on one person or one thing. However, the so-called impact varies from person to person. Even in literature, there are symbolic and realistic schools. Realism can make people understand the truth, but it is not the highest ideal. Because on the one hand, we must consider the beauty of art, and on the other hand, we cannot completely write out without omission. The same is true for other things such as painting and photography. Therefore, we must add selection when taking materials, and its standard should be to take its beauty and remove its ugliness. Interview reporters, when extracting news from society, are in the same situation. If those who are excellent, beautiful, good, and virtuous can be published to the readers to give a good impression, then customs can be changed and a good atmosphere can be cultivated. In the past, the incidents of Ma Zhenhua and Huang Huiru were published in competition, resulting in their tragic results. This is the power of newspapers, and it destroyed them. In fact, there are countless such incidents in society every day. If this trend is not changed, I don't know how many more Huang Huiru will be created. Newspapers have this power, and it should be used positively. There has always been a misconception that praising someone slightly is considered bribery, which results in speakers being unwilling to say good things. This kind of wrong view should be corrected so that the entire society can move upward."</p>

If the method of investigation and research is not thorough to stop manipulation, it is difficult to imagine the future disaster. I was ordered by the Control Yuan to investigate this case, and I know that my duty is to be fair. However, my knowledge is limited.

<h3>Shanghai Income Tax Office Levies Income Tax on Foreigners</h3>
<p>Negotiations with Foreign Ministry for Those with Consular Jurisdiction; Report and Pay for Those without Consular Jurisdiction and Those without Treaties</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Liang Hegu, of the Shanghai Income Tax Office, has been actively planning to levy income tax on foreigners since the introduction of income tax to achieve the purpose of fairness and universality. Now, the salary income of foreign personnel serving in Chinese agencies and the income from interest on foreign purchases of Chinese securities are all taxed according to the withholding income tax. Therefore, further steps are planned to levy income tax on foreign business profits and salary income tax on those serving in foreign companies. The issue of taxation of countries enjoying consular jurisdiction is being negotiated by the Income Tax Office with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the diplomatic representatives of those countries in China. As for companies and shops of countries without consular jurisdiction and countries without treaties, there are more than 600 in Shanghai alone. The office has sent letters to them separately, urging them to report and pay taxes, and at the same time, it has sent letters to the consuls of those countries in Shanghai, urging them to inform their nationals to comply with them.</p>

All members of the delegation will return to Shanghai on the 6th of next month and return to the Netherlands East Indies on the 15th. Mr. Pan told reporters that the delegation's visit to Japan via China and its discussions with various circles in China on Sino-Dutch trade issues were not of an exchange nature, but to give China a good market and promotion opportunities. If the Chinese government can help merchants and know how to improve Chinese cotton cloth and other goods, there will be no problem selling to the Netherlands East Indies. I have telegraphed the price and other items to the Netherlands East Indies. I am very pleased that the results of this delegation's visit to Shanghai have eliminated China's past estrangement from the Netherlands East Indies and the actual discussion of Dutch trade. Sino-Dutch business relations will be greatly increased, and the commercial treaty can also be expected to be discussed.</p>
<h3>Yu Shunqing Asks the National Coal Association to Sanction the Transportation and Sale of Private Coal</h3>
<p>Reporting Zhongfu's Transportation of Private Coal; Demanding Strict Sanctions</p>
<p>Shiye Daily: Yu Shunqing, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Coal Production and Sales Association, believes that unscrupulous merchants act as accomplices to evil, transporting and selling private coal, manipulating the coal market, and destroying national economic construction. He specially sent a letter to the association yesterday, asking them to impose strict sanctions to maintain national production. The original letter stated, "To the point, the active smuggling in North China is invading south, and all industries in Shanghai are suffering serious impact. Taking the mining of coal as an example, since the Liujiang Coal Mine was violently occupied by the Japanese, the coal produced has been private goods, which has long been understood by all walks of life. Unscrupulous merchants are so blinded by profit that they are willing to act as accomplices to evil, secretly cooperating with a certain party to operate, passing off national coal, and selling it in large quantities. It has been found that in Shanghai, Zhongfu Company, which is presided over by Ma Shaoquan and others, has come forward and signed a wholesale contract with a certain foreign firm, renaming it Hebei Coal to cover up people's eyes. Last year, there was a dispute due to uneven distribution of spoils among unscrupulous merchants, which was involved in the court and was known to everyone. Now Ma Shaoquan and others are relying on their evil forces to manipulate the coal market, and the transportation and sale of national coal has been greatly affected. I think that the association is the center of the national coal production and sales, and it is its duty to reject private and save the country. I have specially reported the facts and ask you to propose a discussion and impose strict sanctions to warn unscrupulous merchants and maintain national production, which is extremely urgent."</p>
<h3>Pudong Vegetable Vendors Forced to Donate by the Industry Bureau in Yinxiang Town</h3>
<p>Two Yuan Per Year and Strict Penalties; Municipal Federation Asks Taxpayers Association to Negotiate</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association yesterday, stating, "To the point, it has been approved by the 30th District Branch of the Association that more than 40 members of the Association, including Wan Jiangren, Chen Yinpei, and Zhang Xingsen, have sent a letter stating that Yinxiang Town is located in the remote eastern part of Shanghai and has simple equipment. Since the January 28th Incident, there have been few shops, and the market has become even more depressed. It is all due to the Pudong farmers who gather vegetables in the market. Because there are no vegetable markets, the baskets are lined up under the eaves of the streets to add a few hours of bustle in the morning, attracting residents of Guo Jin to buy vegetables. All the objects are arranged, and the members operate on a small scale, relying on it to maintain the food and clothing of their families. Unexpectedly, the Industry Bureau has repeatedly sent Chinese and Western detectives to warn the vegetable vendors that they must have a license to sell. Your Association has prepared a letter to the Industry Bureau to sympathize with the difficulties of the merchants and exempt them from obtaining a license. However, the Industry Bureau refused to accept it. Now, regardless of the people's situation, it suddenly dispatched a police car in the morning, waiting for the vegetable vendors to leave the shore at the Yangshupu Bridge, Dinghai Bridge, and Electric Light Bridge piers. Regardless of whether they are selling along the road in the concession, they are all ordered to obtain a license (two yuan per month). Those who do not have money to obtain a license are detained and the penalties are severe. The vegetable vendors are all afraid of it. It is found that the Industry Bureau stipulates that carrying on the shoulder is not subject to licensing, and they do not come to Shanghai every day to sell. Such exorbitant taxes are not only a great loss to Yinxiang Town, but also affect the livelihoods of the common people, which is unbearable. Your Association is the largest group of citizens and is more concerned about unfair situations. I also ask you to convey to the Municipal Federation for unanimous assistance. It has been found that the vegetable vendors in the town do not sell along the road and there is no vegetable market. They have never been licensed. (According to the most prosperous area, the license in the vegetable market is only fifty cents.) Now, the Industry Bureau has no obligation in the over-border area and suddenly imposes a heavy tax, which is very unfair. It is reasonable to present it for negotiation."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Resolves to Issue Letters Regarding Excess Total Donations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Extraordinarily Increases Property Tax, Affecting More Than Just the Natural Hotel</p>
<p>The First Special Honesty Citizens' Union of this city, upon receiving a report from the 35th District Branch, regarding the member Natural Hotel, which rented several buildings on Zhifu Road, Guizhou Road, from Yifeng Foreign Firm. The monthly rent is eight hundred and thirty-seven yuan. Calculated at fourteen percent, the quarterly property tax payable to the Municipal Council should be three hundred and thirty-four yuan and seven jiao four fen. However, the tax receipts show that since the autumn of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the quarterly tax collected has been three hundred and fifty-nine yuan and two jiao four fen. This is an excess of twenty-four yuan and five jiao beyond the amount that should be paid. Up to the spring of this year, the total amount of extra tax collected has reached a huge sum of one hundred and seventy-one yuan and five jiao. Although repeated negotiations have been made with the Municipal Council and the tax collector, no satisfactory result has been achieved. After receiving the report, the union believes that the Municipal Council's extra property tax collection within the concession is not limited to the Natural Hotel alone. Some may be silently enduring it, or although they have negotiated, there has been no result. Regarding the extra tax donations, it has been decided to send letters to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association and the Municipal Council for strict negotiation, to relieve the suffering of taxpayers.</p>

It is reported that the funds will be used to purchase food and distribute it to the disaster victims, and to purchase various seeds so that farmers can resume cultivation work.</p>

<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Submits a Petition to the Municipal Government Requesting the Cessation of the Cattle Slaughter Tax</h3>
<p>Business Losses - How Can the Yellow Melon of Huangtai Be Picked Again? If There Is a Reason, Immediately Order the Revocation; Otherwise, Please Indicate Clearly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting the abolition of the proposed establishment of a cattle slaughter tax. The petition stated, "The petition is to request a matter based on the facts. According to a letter from the Cattle and Sheep Industry Association of this city, it has recently been heard that the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau has submitted a request to establish a cattle slaughter tax. The members of the association have been coming to the association to inquire about whether this is the case. The association has not seen a clear announcement from the Finance Bureau and has not dared to believe it. However, the members believe that it is indeed the case and that it has been stipulated that a large head of cattle will be taxed three yuan, and a small head of cattle will be taxed one yuan and five jiao. According to the proposed collection regulations, it must be approved by the Shanghai Municipal Government and then promulgated and implemented. The words were explicit. They run around and tell each other, all trembling with fear. The association believes that if the rumor is true, then the future will be difficult and the future is unimaginable. Most of the cattle and sheep industry are small businesses. Forced by livelihood, they do not hesitate to raise debts as operating capital and only earn meager profits. However, due to the excessive burden, they often lose money. The profit is not obtained, and the capital is exhausted. As a result, they not only cannot maintain their lives but are burdened with debt and forced by creditors. The cunning ones certainly flee, while the honest ones sell their wives and children to repay their debts. Therefore, the events of families being scattered and people dying are often seen. The misery in this situation is heartbreaking to speak of. After January 28th, the industry was not only affected by the sluggish market but also suffered from the severe restrictions on cattle exports imposed by the inland provinces to protect cattle breeding. It is difficult to transport, and the price has increased sharply. The burden is even heavier than before, and the market is declining, and business is sluggish, so it is getting worse. Therefore, the number of bankruptcies is unprecedented in decades. The number of members who closed down and withdrew from the association can be found in the files submitted by this association to higher authorities. To this day, all businesses are losing money, the accumulation is difficult to reverse, and they have fallen into a dying state. In addition, this city has a concession relationship, and the government comes from many sources. The French Concession held a cattle and sheep transit tax last year (this association is still firmly opposed to it). This has set a bad precedent. The Public Concession has newly established various restrictions on this industry, increasing the burden. Their pain is indescribable. The yellow melon of Huangtai, how can it be picked again? Anyone with a human heart would have no time to pity and save this industry in the midst of water and fire, how could they bear to create this unreasonable cattle slaughter tax to increase its burden and hasten its death? Furthermore, the slaughter tax is a kind of exorbitant tax. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau held a cattle tax, collecting one yuan and four jiao per head. After the firm opposition and appeals of the entire industry, on January 20th of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Finance Minister Song issued Instruction No. 391, instructing the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct the Finance Bureau to stop collecting this tax. It is sufficient to show that exorbitant taxes are useless to the public and only trouble the merchants. The central government will never allow its establishment. The abolition of exorbitant taxes has also been repeatedly ordered by the government to be implemented by the provincial and municipal authorities. Article 4 of the Regulations for the Implementation of the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on March 25th of this year stipulates that the original slaughter taxes in various localities should also be changed to business tax. Shanghai has never had this kind of slaughter tax, how can it be newly established to disrupt the national financial system? The emperor's decrees are clearly visible. Even if the local authorities ignore the suffering of the merchants, they cannot abandon the government's laws. The Shanghai authorities have always been concerned about the people's suffering and respect the laws of the central government. At this time when the industry's survival is dying, they will not rashly hold this unreasonable cattle slaughter tax. However, the public's opinions are mixed, or they are well-founded, and the association has learned from the misery suffered by the industry when the Finance Bureau held the cattle donation in the 16th year of the Republic of China. Fearing that the same mistakes will be repeated, and disaster will be unpredictable, so it has specially prepared a letter to appeal to your association to submit it to the Municipal Government, begging to cherish the victims after the robbery, who cannot afford to increase the burden. If the Finance Bureau really has a proposal to hold a cattle slaughter tax, please order it to be revoked. If there is no such thing, please issue a statement to dispel doubts and stabilize commerce. The association has received a notice stating that after the implementation of the business tax, the original tooth tax, stamp tax, and slaughter tax in various provinces should be changed to business tax. This city's business tax has not been implemented due to the special circumstances of the concession relationship and after the loss of commercial vitality on January 28th. Now, suddenly, it is proposed to hold a cattle slaughter tax for the industry. If what is heard is true, not only will the industry decline day by day and be difficult to bear, but also according to the national tax law, it is unreasonable and unsupported. The petition requests your government to review and approve it. If the Finance Bureau has such an act, please order it to be revoked immediately, otherwise, please indicate it clearly to dispel public doubts. This is a matter of public convenience."</p>
<h3>The National Tour of Air Defense Exhibition Comes to Shanghai to Participate in the Exhibition</h3>
<p>Agreement Has Been Obtained from the Military Commission</p>
<p>The Shanghai Air Defense Association, in order to participate in the 10th Anniversary Celebration of the Shanghai Municipal Government, had previously decided to hold an air defense exhibition from that day to the 18th of the same month to celebrate the grand event. It is now heard that since the air defense exhibition has been actively prepared, the progress has been quite smooth. All the exhibits, such as models and charts, will be completed soon, and many other display materials have also been collected. It is expected that the exhibition will open as scheduled. It is also heard that in order to make the exhibits of the air defense exhibition complete, the Air Defense Association has contacted the Military Commission and requested that all the materials of the National Tour of Air Defense Exhibition be borrowed for the exhibition. The request has been approved. It is expected that it can be transported to Shanghai at the end of this month. It is noted that the National Tour of Air Defense Exhibition has been held in Nanjing, Changsha, Wuhan, Guilin, and other places in recent years. Its scale is grand and its materials are substantial. It is rare in the world. It is a rare opportunity to display it in Shanghai this time.</p>
<h3>Chen Tiesheng of the Child Welfare Association Informs of the Disaster Relief Situation</h3>
<p>Sichuan Establishes Three Reception Centers, Hoping for Unified Assistance from Shanghai</p>
<p>Chen Tiesheng, the Deputy Secretary-General of the China Child Welfare Association, was ordered by the President, Kong Xiangxi, to take the Zhonghang plane, Nanjing, on the morning of the 16th to fly to Sichuan to handle the affairs of receiving disaster-stricken children. According to news from the Child Welfare Association, Chen stayed in Hankou for some reason on the 16th and took the original plane on the 17th. He arrived in Chongqing at 10:00 am on the same day. Those who welcomed him at the airport included Pan Yimin, the manager of the Chongqing Branch of the Bank of China, Peng Ruicheng, the representative of the Aviation Affairs Office, representatives of various charitable organizations in Chongqing, and many journalists. After Chen got off the plane, he entered the city and stayed at the Central Yuhang Bank, and then moved to the YMCA. Relevant groups and organizations in the local area held meetings to welcome him and discussed specific measures for receiving disaster-stricken children with Chen. According to Chen, it is planned to establish larger-scale disaster-stricken children's reception centers in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Yitai. Other places will consider establishing reception centers if there is a need and possibility. The standard for receiving disaster-stricken children is limited to those under the age of 14 who are truly impoverished and helpless. The local communities will be responsible for donating the start-up costs of the reception centers, while the Child Welfare Association will be responsible for the annual expenses. Chen also relayed the Shanghai Children Save Children Movement, saying that Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, has ordered all junior high school children in the city to donate two cents each day, and primary school children to donate one cent each day to raise huge sums of money to help children in disaster areas. All sectors in Sichuan expressed their admiration and gratitude for this initiative. In the quick letter, Chen even more urgently stated that the disaster relief movement for children in Sichuan has already begun, hoping that people in Shanghai can rise up and assist together so that the disaster relief movement can proceed smoothly and children can be spared from the ravines. This is the greatest fortune for the country and the nation.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Again Urges the Relocation of Shantytowns in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Most Shantytown Residents Make a Living by Growing Vegetables; There Are Concerns That the Land Will Be Abandoned After Demolition</p>
<p>The residents of the shantytowns along the Jiaozhou Park area in Western Shanghai are in a panic after receiving the Municipal Council's order to demolish them by the end of this month. They have appealed to all sectors. The shantytown residents received another notice yesterday urging them to demolish the shantytowns, which caused even greater panic. Representatives were sent to organizations such as the Municipal Union to request that they quickly negotiate with the Municipal Council to demand the withdrawal of the order. Because the shantytown residents in this area are different from those in Eastern Shanghai, those in the Eastern District are all small businesses or rickshaw pullers, while the shantytown residents in Western Shanghai all make a living by growing vegetables. The shantytowns are surrounded by vegetables. The whole family depends on this for a living. The Yanping Road area in Western Shanghai was originally wasteland. After several years of hard work by these shantytown residents, they have achieved such good results. Now, if the shacks are demolished one day, they will inevitably abandon the surrounding cultivated land. How will they make a living in the future? Therefore, they hope that the authorities will provide relief.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Buddhist Association Petitions to Participate in the County Administration Meeting</h3>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association yesterday submitted a document to the Ministry of the Interior stating, "Our Cixian Branch reported, 'We believe that Buddhist associations, in accordance with the Regulations for Supervising Temples and the provisions of the articles of association, have considerable responsibility and authority for enforcing religious rules and supervising temple property. We have been notified by the Ministry of the Interior to inform the whole country of this matter. Now, there are still reports of incidents of driving monks away from property, demolishing temples, and destroying Buddhas. The reason for this is that the government's decrees have not been implemented, and not that the government is not providing protection. If Buddhist branches can be allowed to participate in the county administration meetings convened by the county governments, then matters related to Buddhism that should be addressed and reformed, as well as other related matters, can be proposed and discussed for the purpose of implementing protection and avoiding the separation of monks and occupation of property, or it may be reduced gradually. The associations, in view of this, intend to ask your association to petition the Ministry of the Interior to instruct all provincial and county governments to allow the leaders of the Buddhist Association to attend and participate in the county administration meetings when they are convened. Is this appropriate? We ask for your consideration and instruction.'" According to Article 2, Section 3 of the County Government Administrative Meeting Regulations promulgated by your ministry, it is clearly stipulated that the leaders of local organizations may be appointed as members by the county magistrate. The Buddhist Association is one of the local organizations, so the county magistrate may appoint them to participate in the meeting to communicate opinions and avoid disputes. The aforementioned situation, can it be approved to inform all counties in the country to handle it as appropriate? This document is submitted for your review and implementation, which is truly for the public convenience.</p>

<h3>Before the Completion of the National Assembly Elections, Agricultural Associations Will Temporarily Maintain the Status Quo</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Orders the Social Affairs Bureau to Forward the Notification</p>
<p>Before the completion of the election of representatives to the National Assembly, local people's organizations will temporarily suspend re-election. The Central Department of Civilian Training has previously stipulated the measures and sent them to the party headquarters of various provinces and cities for reference. Now, the department has sent a letter to the Executive Yuan requesting that the competent authorities be instructed to ensure that the agricultural associations in various places temporarily maintain the status quo before the completion of the National Assembly elections, as the Agricultural Association Law and the Implementation Law of the Agricultural Association have been revised and promulgated, and the reorganization of agricultural associations in various places in accordance with the new law will inevitably disrupt the election administration and cause disputes. Yesterday, the Municipal Government received a telegram from the Ministry of the Interior, forwarding the instruction from the Executive Yuan regarding the aforementioned case, which has been ordered to be forwarded to the Social Affairs Bureau for unified notification.</p>
<h3>Chambers of Commerce and Industry Associations Must Affix Seals and Logos to Their Submissions</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Orders the Social Affairs Bureau to Instruct Them</p>
<p>The Municipal Government recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry stating that Article 35 of the Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates that after the Chamber of Commerce is approved for record, the Ministry of Industry will issue a seal. Article 9 of the Implementing Rules of the Industry Association Law stipulates that after the association is approved, the local competent government agency will issue a logo. The aforementioned issuance should be done by each association separately submitting public fees and applying for them automatically in accordance with the law. Recently, some chambers of commerce that have been approved for record in various places have not yet applied for seals or are still using the old seals issued by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. As for the logos of industry associations, since they have been issued by the local competent government agencies, the reported lists of re-elected members often do not have the logo affixed or the association name is simply marked with an ordinary long stamp, which is not in accordance with the law. In the future, all documents submitted by chambers of commerce and industry associations that have been approved for record should be affixed with seals or logos to show caution and comply with the regulations. It is heard that the Municipal Government, after receiving this telegram, has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to forward it for compliance.</p>

<h3>Labor Disputes Are Gradually Resolved</h3>
<p>Silk Weaving Industry: After the joint meeting of the party, government, and police decided on the handling methods for the labor dispute in the silk weaving industry in this city, the workers of Nanshi Meiya warp and weft and the general factory have complied with the order to enter the factory and resume work. Yesterday, two workers were arrested by the police for preventing workers from entering the factory near the factory.

<p>▲Lin Factory: The Yunlin Silk Factory at No. 484 Linqing Road, East Shanghai, employs more than 90 workers. The business was usually fairly developed. This time, a strike broke out because the factory failed to implement the arbitration measures of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and fired the worker Zhang Ji'an. Zhou Xuexiang, chairman of the General Labor Union, was repeatedly asked for assistance. In order to eliminate the labor dispute, the union specially convened both labor and management parties the day before yesterday to persuade them separately. The factory accepted all the minimum requirements of the workers. Both parties were satisfied. Yesterday, Hu Menglin, a member of the General Labor Union, and He Yingbei of the Seventh District Silk Weaving Industry Union went together to resume work. Chinese and Western detectives were sent outside to protect the order, which was very good. The dispute was resolved.</p>
<p>Zhongshan Factory: The workers of the Zhongshan Iron and Steel Factory at No. 59 Bairinan Road went on strike because the Japanese foreman unreasonably beat the boiler room worker Kong Ashan, causing the workers to mutually advise not to enter the factory to work, resulting in the suspension of most of the work. However, a small number of Japanese workers did not join the strike, so the factory announced that there was no strike. After the incident, the Foreign Manufacturers Workers Welfare Association took the initiative to mediate. As a result, the factory agreed to be responsible for compensating the injured worker for medical expenses of five yuan and to record a major demerit for the Japanese foreman who committed the crime. The Chinese workers were satisfied and all returned to work on Sunday evening. The marine corps and obstacles stationed at the factory were all removed that afternoon.</p>

However, these bangs are connected to the outer harbor and have been dispersed by the tide, so after searching for many days, nothing was found.

<h3>Police Chief Doubles as Rental Accountant</h3>
<p>Abuse of Power Ensures No Rent Arrears, But Embezzlement Leads to Landlord's Lawsuit</p>
<p>Huang Xingsheng, a local resident (26 years old) residing at No. 19, Dahua Lane, Jingxiu Road, in the city, inherited ancestral property at Xiejiao Xinqiao Road and other places. Tenants often defaulted on rent, making collection difficult. However, a police chief named Zhong Weichuan from the police station abused his power to act as Huang Xingsheng's rental accountant. As expected, no tenants dared to delay payment. However, Zhong pocketed the collected rent, totaling over one thousand and forty-seven dollars and fifty cents. Huang repeatedly demanded the money to no avail, and hired lawyer Zhou Hongji to file a lawsuit in the local court, accusing him of business embezzlement. The indictment stated that the defendant undertook to collect rent for the plaintiff's seven buildings and four bungalows located at No. 30 South Lane, Xinqiao Xiejiao Road, in November of the 20th year [of the Republic]. The monthly rent was one hundred and six dollars and thirty cents, with a deduction of fourteen dollars for management fees, resulting in a net amount of ninety-two dollars and fifty cents to be paid. It was agreed that half of the amount would be paid on the 15th of each month, and the balance would be paid at the end of the month. Li Xinglong Company was responsible for guaranteeing the rent payment, with a signed rent collection record and a guarantee slip as proof. However, starting from February of the 25th year [of the Republic], the defendant secretly used the collected rent each month for personal purposes, totaling one thousand and forty-seven dollars and fifty cents by December of last year. Despite repeated demands, the defendant refused to return the money, thus violating Article 236, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Lu Hongze opened the trial, but the defendant denied the charges and presented witnesses. However, the witnesses' testimony was unfavorable to the defendant. The judge, suspecting that the cunning defendant might collude with witnesses, ordered his detention, prohibited visitation, and rescheduled the trial.</p>
<h3>Tu Guifang Sued by Concubine for Abandonment</h3>
<p>Plaintiff Not of Legal Age; Formal Lawsuit Procedures Need to Be Supplemented</p>
<p>Tu Guifang, owner of Dasheng Hardware Store in Tiantong Lane, Broadway, enjoys frequenting pleasure quarters. He is often seen at the Liangyue brothel in the Changsan district. Inside the brothel, there is a young prostitute named Li Yingzhen, who possesses some beauty. Tu appreciates her very much. In the winter before last, he redeemed her from prostitution. Last autumn, after Li gave birth to a daughter, Tu moved her from Wuchang Road to the upstairs of a clothing store in Tongren Lane, Touba Road, to live with his first wife. Li then realized that Tu's earlier promises of a proper marriage were all lies. However, since what's done is done, she had to endure living as a concubine. But the first wife was very intolerant, often abusing her. Tu, fearing his wife's authority, could not protect her. Li then took her daughter and left Tu's home. She then appointed lawyer Qian Xingzhong to represent her in negotiations with Tu. Because a peaceful resolution could not be reached, she filed a lawsuit against Tu Guifang in the First Special District Local Court, stating that Tu initially coveted her beauty and lured her with promises of marriage, but ultimately deliberately abandoned her. She requested that the court grant a divorce and order him to compensate for the expenses of raising and educating the daughter, totaling one thousand nine hundred and twenty dollars. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu opened the trial. The defendant did not appear, but lawyer Wang Xintang appeared on his behalf to defend. Judge Xu questioned the plaintiff, who stated that she was twenty years old this year, born on the sixteenth day of the fourth lunar month. Checking her age, she was not yet twenty years old, and according to the law, she did not have the right to sue. He immediately ordered a rescheduling and instructed the plaintiff to correct the lawsuit procedures before another trial.</p>
<h3>An Escapee from Qidong Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>On April 9th of this year, several robbers escaped from Qidong County Prison without a trace. Recently, the county government's detective, based on a tip from an informant named Lu Song, learned that a robber named Lu Mazi, from Chongming, had changed his name to Jiang Jinrong and was hiding in the Chen Shunji carpentry shop at No. 114, Xinjibang Road, Shanghai, evading the law. He then came to Shanghai the day before yesterday and contacted the Huishan Police Station, requesting assistance in the arrest. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched and went to the location to arrest him and brought him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the situation, stating that, according to the investigation, Lu Mazi had only been in Shanghai for nine days since escaping from Qidong. Detective Xu had come to the court to testify, stating that recently there had been many robbery cases in Qidong.

<h3>Armed Robbery and Resistance to Arrest by Robbers on Zhiyuan Road, Zhabei</h3>
<p>Police Detectives Ambush in Advance, Firing Over Twenty Shots; Result: Three Robbers Captured Alive, One Woman Hit by Stray Bullet</p>
<p>A gang of robbers was hiding in a shack on Zhiyuan Road, Zhabei. The City Police Bureau's Detective Division learned of this and secretly dispatched detectives Yu Liankui and others, along with police officers Gui Bin and Ma Bingheng from the Yongxing Road Police Station, to the above-mentioned location for an ambush at 7:40 p.m. yesterday. After a while, they saw several men in long gowns and silk short outfits arrive, whispering to each other as if making secret plans. At that time, the police officers on guard gave a secret signal and rushed forward to arrest them. The robbers, realizing that they had been discovered, scattered and fled, opening fire to resist arrest. The police officers also returned fire. Bullets rained down, sounding like a string of pearls. The robbers retreated while fighting, and the police officers bravely pursued them. As a result, two robbers were arrested, one named He Bufa, from Yancheng, 41 years old, and the other named Wu Chunshen, from Xinghua, 34 years old. Another robber fled westward along Zhiyuan Road, entered Qiujiang Road via Zhongxing Road, and reached Yuyingtang Road. Exhausted, he was finally intercepted by police officers Li Chengao and Sun Kexue from posts No. 8 and No. 10, assisted by detective Yu, who confiscated a six-inch Browning pistol with four bullets inside. All were taken to the Yongxing Road Police Station. After a brief interrogation, it was learned that his name was Chen Zhusun, from Xuzhou, 32 years old. The three robbers, along with the gun and ammunition, were taken back to the Detective Division for interrogation, and the remaining fugitives were pursued. In this operation, the police and robbers exchanged fire over twenty times. A stray bullet only hit a woman from Funing, Shen Yin (49 years old, residing at No. 22 in a shack on Zhiyuan Road), in the lower abdomen, but the bullet did not pass through. The police station dispatched police officer No. 256 to escort her to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that her injuries are quite serious.</p>
<h3>Brawl at Shanghai Dance Hall</h3>
<p>Dancers Cause Trouble by Assembling a Crowd; Sentences Vary Based on Interrogation</p>
<p>A fight broke out at the Shanghai Dance Hall at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Fujian Road at 9:15 p.m. the day before yesterday. The Lao Zha Police Station, upon hearing the report, immediately ordered detective Cao Qishan to go to the scene and arrest fifteen perpetrators. After bringing them to the police station, six of them were released after it was determined that they were not involved. The remaining nine people, including Sun Xianglin, Zhou Yongfu, Peng Yishou, Wu Fuqing, Zhang Sibao, He Songshun, Sun Fengshan, Li Qingsheng, and Li Ruiquan, were detained. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Zhang Shizhu presented them to Criminal Division 2 of the First Court and charged them with property damage under Article 254 of the Criminal Law, and explained the case. He stated that the defendants had consistently denied the charges after being detained at the police station. Later, the police station found out that the defendants were all workers at the British American Tobacco Company, with monthly salaries of only twenty yuan, and could not regularly go to dance halls to dance. After a detailed investigation, it was learned that a dancer named Chen Kefu, an employee of the British American Tobacco Company, had refused to buy a dance ticket and refused to pay for tea when he went to the Shanghai Dance Hall to dance. The dance hall forced him to pay. Chen was dissatisfied and left resentfully. The following Saturday, he gathered many workers from the factory to make trouble (commonly known as "supporting the hall"). Words failed, and they smashed teapots, tables, and chairs. Chen has not yet been apprehended. According to Tang Yiya, the manager of the Shanghai Dance Hall, the damage to property and business losses totaled three hundred seventy-three dollars and seventy cents, and requested compensation. When questioned, the defendants all admitted to going to the dance hall with Chen Kefu, but denied fighting and damaging property. They hired lawyer Ma Leming to defend them. Judge Pan ruled in court that Wu Fuqing was a repeat offender and sentenced him to twenty days of detention. The remaining eight people, including Sun Xianglin, were each sentenced to fifteen days of detention. If they choose to pay a fine in lieu of detention, two days of detention would be equivalent to one dollar. The civil suit was transferred to the civil court for trial.</p>

<h3>Society for the Protection of Animals Forbids Beggars from Extorting Money with Snakes</h3>
<p>Every summer in this city, beggars capture a kind of bluish-white snake, about three feet long, from the countryside. They grind off its teeth and then, in groups of two, go to various shops and lane residents to extort money. If they are not given money, they will place the snake on the table or on the ground, letting it wander around. Those who encounter it are invariably frightened and rush to avoid it. They take the opportunity to steal clothes and utensils. In view of this, the China Society for the Protection of Animals believes that it is difficult for one snake to be small, and it should not be subjected to such cruel treatment. Their fraud and extortion are even more illegal and violate public order. Therefore, yesterday, they sent a special letter to the city police局ordering a strict prohibition and crackdown.</p>

<h3>Wang Yutai Property Division Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Wang Zhenjia Comes to Shanghai to Sue Wang Zhixue and His Son; Requests Litigation Assistance Due to Difficult Circumstances</p>
<p>Wang Yutai Tea House in this city is one of the most famous shops in Shanghai, with nearly ten branches, and is a leader in the tea industry. The shop was founded 83 years ago by Zhuo Xianyong from Jixi, Anhui, who had three sons: Lizheng (eldest), Wenhuan (second), and Lizhu (youngest). In the sixth year of Xianfeng during the Qing Dynasty, Xianyong sold more than ten acres of ancestral property in his hometown and ordered his eldest son, Lizheng, to come to Shanghai to run a tea business. Wenhuan and Lizhu set up a stronghold in Anhui to handle affairs and cooperated with each other. Later, Lizheng founded a shop in Shanghai, which Xianyong named Wang Yutai, meaning to take advantage of the ancestral blessings of the Wang family and to create a great business of "two sheep bringing prosperity." Lizheng had a son named Zhixue. Wenhuan had no children. Lizhu had two sons, Zhizheng (eldest) and Zhigao (second). Zhigao was adopted by Wenhuan as his heir. Zhixue and his son Zhenhuan jointly managed the Wang Yutai tea houses in Shanghai. Zhizheng engaged in other businesses. His son, Zhenjia, is currently working at the Hukaiwen Ink Shop in Yixian, Anhui. Wang Zhenjia claimed that his father Zhizheng and his uncle Zhixue and cousin Zhenhuan occupied the jointly owned property while running the shop in Shanghai. Five years ago, he came to Shanghai and entrusted lawyer Wu Chengyu to file lawsuits in the First and Second Special District Courts for property division. However, Zhixue and Zhenhuan used various methods to lure him back to his hometown, causing the lawsuits to be put on hold. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, Zhizheng died of illness in his hometown of Anhui, leaving behind his wife, Wang Cao, 69 years old this year, and his son, Wang Zhenjia, who lived in poverty. He requested his uncle to divide the inheritance, but was denied. Fearing that as time passed, there would be no basis for his claim, he came to Shanghai and hired lawyers Wang Liwu and Lv Xiehua to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against his uncle Wang Zhixue and cousin Wang Zhenhuan for property division. He claimed that the total value of the property was 1.2 million yuan, and that he should be entitled to one-third, or 400,000 yuan. He also stated that he was in financial difficulty and could not pay the litigation fees, and requested litigation assistance. The court, based on the indictment and the request for litigation assistance, summoned Judge Ma Yishu to the Civil Division 7 yesterday morning. The defendants Wang Zhixue and Wang Zhenhuan did not appear. The lawyers representing the plaintiff stated the purpose of the lawsuit and the request for litigation assistance. After reviewing the statements, the court instructed the plaintiff to provide a written guarantee from a reliable shop worth more than 1,860 yuan for investigation of the property and scheduled another hearing.</p>

<h3>Robbery and Murder Case in Pudong Is Extremely Complex</h3>
<p>Victim Once Kidnapped by Robbers; Kidnappers Released from Prison and Attempted to Extort Money; Simultaneously, Another Group of Robbers Commits Robbery</p>
<p>On the morning of May 4th of this year, at 3 a.m., the residence of Chen Tingzhang, owner of the Huamei Electric Material Store, located at No. 187 Yangjiazhai, Pudong, was broken into by thieves. At that time, Chen's son resisted with a shotgun, resulting in his death by the thieves. The Lao Zha Police Station's Chinese and Western detectives have arrested the perpetrators Zhang Pingjiang, Chen Zhenghe, Chi Tiemin, Zhao Juju, and Xie Jindi, and have handed them over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, Chief Chinese Detective You A'gen, Detectives Yang Huocai, Pang Ruiqing, Wang Jiaju, Zhu Shanghe, and others from the police station have discovered that accomplices in the case were hiding at No. 2, Lane 201, Changping Road. They rushed to arrest Jiangbei native Wang Dian (also known as Wen Yuan), Anhui native Wang Amao, Zhenjiang native Jia Youquan, and Hubei native Li Jinsheng on the 19th, seizing a box cannon and two iron bars from the house and taking them back to the police station. While the police car was en route, Wang Amao suddenly took out two bullets from his pocket and threw them into the car, which was seen by the detective, who seized them. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the circumstances of the arrest and stated that, according to the police station's investigation, the situation was extremely complex. The victim, Chen Tingzhang, had been kidnapped by bandits in the 17th year of the Republic of China. The City Police Bureau arrested a person named Jin Lifu and sent him to the local court for sentencing. Jin has now been released from prison. Zhang Pingjiang and others conspired to go to Chen's house to negotiate and try to extort money. However, when Zhang and others went to Chen's house, another gang of robbers, namely the defendants in this case, also arrived at the same time, intending to commit robbery. Therefore, the defendants in this case did not know Zhang Pingjiang and others when they were questioned at the police station. The police station is now investigating whether the person who shot and killed Chen's son was one of the defendants in the case today or one of the previously apprehended Zhang Pingjiang and others. However, the case is complicated, so he requested that it be rescheduled and tried together. It was also reported that the four suspects apprehended in this case had scars on their bodies from shotgun wounds, and they had all confessed. When questioned, the four suspects, including Wang Dian, all confessed to going to Chen's house to commit robbery, but denied knowing Zhang Pingjiang and others. After reviewing the confessions, Criminal Division Chief Qian Hongye ordered the four suspects, including Wang, to be remanded in custody and tried together with Zhang Pingjiang and others.</p>

<h3>The Pushan Villa Regularly Stages Performances to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>The Sixth of June Renewal Stage hosts day and night Peking Opera performances.</p>
<p>Pushan Villa specializes in providing charitable services such as burying the exposed corpses, providing medical treatment, and dispensing medicine. It has been in existence for over twenty years, and its relationship with public health is significant. During this summer season, with the hot weather, the number of corpses entrusted to various organizations and hospitals is very high, and the number of people seeking medical treatment is also constantly increasing. The supply of coffins, medicines, etc., cannot meet the demand, the workload is huge, and raising funds is difficult. Therefore, directors Wang Yiting, Lu Liankui, Yao Mulian, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Liangyu, Shi Gengyin, and others have initiated day and night opera performances at the Renewal Stage starting from the 30th of this month. Participants are all famous amateur performers and talented ladies in Shanghai. The participation of Misses Gui Fen and Gui Fang, the daughters of Mr. Lu Liankui, in this masterpiece shows a dedication to public welfare and is particularly commendable. The program includes day performances such as Chen Liangyu and Wang Shuying's "Battle of Beiyuan," Wang Shurong's "Wu Zhaoguan," Qian Juyou and Peng Guohuan's "Yellow Crane Tower," Chen Kanglin's "Farewell Kiln," Zhang Guisun's "Scolding Cao," Bao Guangyu's "Golden Lock Record," Wang Benshan's "Losing the Seal and Rescuing from Fire," and Qian Mingpan's "Huarong Road." Night performances include Chen Liangyu and Miss Yue Juan's "Candlelight Record," Qian Juyou and Wang Shuying's "Empty City Stratagem," Zhang Guisun and Miss Liu Meiyu's "Four Plate Mountain," Miss Wu Zhixing's "Cosmic Edge," Shi Shenchu's "Chasing Han Xin," Miss Lu Guifen's "June Snow," Miss Lu Guifang and Mrs. Sang's "Repenting at Dragon Town," Tang Shizhen's "Searching the Orphan to Save Him," Wang Yucheng's "Setting the Army Mountain," Yao Mulian and Ms. Ling Xiangjuan's "Wu Jia Po," Wang Detian's "Beating the Luan Carriage," and You Jusun's "Riot at Jiaxing Prefecture." These are all wonderful and well-matched works. It is expected that benevolent gentlemen with a passion for opera will come together to support this charitable cause.</p>

Near the intersection of Avenue Edward VII, they were suddenly hit by a cargo truck and fell to the ground. The Zhu child's head was crushed on the spot and died immediately. The Cao child, because he was sitting at the back of the bicycle, fell more lightly and only suffered head injuries. He was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Xu Guansong Murder Case to Be Publicly Tried Today</h3>
<p>Wu Jinbao, nicknamed "Robber Jin," who manufactured drugs in the Xujiazhai area of Hongzhen, was investigated by the Hongzhen Police Substation in October of last year because of the case.

<h3>The Calculation Method of Statistical Data on Salt Affairs in Our Country (1)</h3>
<p>Zhang Xinglian, Director of Statistics, Salt Affairs Administration (Also Responding to Mr. Shi Lian's "The Crisis of China's Salt Tax")</p>
<p>Recently, people in society have paid much attention to salt affairs in our country, and various discussions on salt affairs issues have been repeatedly published in newspapers, with some using statistical figures as a basis. However, if the statistical data on salt affairs is not thoroughly researched, the content is not carefully examined, and various comparisons are not made, errors in argument can easily occur. For example, in Mr. Shi Lian's article "The Crisis of China's Salt Tax," published in the Dagongbao on May 28 and 29, he discussed the situation of salt tax in our country over the past ten years and used statistical data as a basis. However, the method of calculating statistics used was fundamentally flawed, and the conclusions reached differed greatly from the facts. Please explain separately: ㊀ Mr. Shi Lian cited the statistics on salt release and tax revenue from the "Salt Affairs Records" and the "Annual Report of the Salt Affairs Audit Office," intending to prove that although salt tax revenue has increased annually, the amount of salt released has declined in recent years, indicating poor management of salt affairs. When making statistical comparisons, one must first understand the content of each figure and whether the parts included are the same; otherwise, no comparison can be made. If a comparison is forced, the results obtained will inevitably be erroneous. In the table listed by Mr. Shi Lian, the figures for salt release and tax revenue for the last sixteen years include the Jiao salt of the three northeastern provinces (Liaoning District) for the first ten years but not for the last six years. This is the first error. To study the state of salt affairs in our country based on salt release statistics, the number of salt exported to foreign countries and the tax revenue should not be included. Mr. Shi Lian's mixed comparison is the second error. In salt affairs statistics, salt that has paid the full tax is called "released salt." If only a portion of the tax is paid, such as Huai salt transported to the four banks of the Yangtze River, only the yard tax is collected in the production area, and the transportation is called "transfer." This is not included in the salt release statistics and is explained in detail in the annual report. Therefore, when Changping salt has not yet been sold, it is generally not calculated. Mr. Shi Lian's miscalculation of Changping salt in the salt release statistics is the third error. The statistical tables in the "Salt Affairs Records" and the annual report are divided into regions and categories, making analysis very easy. Now, the three northeastern provinces and other regions are listed separately (excluding exported salt) (To be continued).</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Father's Day</h3>
<p>— Ruo Ying</p>
<p>The first Sunday of June every year is Father's Day.</p>
<p>Although the creation of this thing was three years earlier than the Mother's Day that recently passed, in China, it doesn't seem to be as lively as Mother's Day. This can certainly be explained by saying that people feel the grace of mothers more than the strictness of fathers, so even in these subtle places, there is an unconscious distinction. But the more practical reason is probably in the former rather than the latter: remembrance always belongs to the weak.</p>
<p>There are many examples of "no remembrance." In these examples, the side that wants to be remembered is always the defenseless weak, so weak that they can't even withstand a gust of wind and will "accidentally fall into the water." The stronger side not only doesn't like remembrance, but sometimes forbids it because they are afraid of hearing the drooping, sad, and mournful cries, lest the neighbors feel uncomfortable. As for remembrances that belong to the category of celebrations, although sometimes they seem exceptionally happy, wanting to have a universal celebration, it is actually to show that the world is at peace, or to make people forget the pain, which is the so-called borrowing alcohol to relieve sorrow. Sometimes, it's even "during times of national crisis, everything is simplified," just holding a meeting or a ceremony.</p>
<p>Isn't the reason why Mother's Day is more lively than Father's Day precisely to make the children understand that their lives came from the hard work of their poor mothers? And those who are most active in Mother's Day are precisely these current or future mothers. As for men, they are as indifferent to it as they are to Father's Day.</p>
<p>The nurturing grace of parents is unforgettable. But after seeing "Father Returns," one also knows that the eldest son who didn't recognize his father wasn't wrong either. Children are not the private property of their parents, let alone slaves. We often call children "little citizens." Speaking correctly, the responsibility for cultivating "little citizens" should belong to society, to the nation, and also, one might say, half to the parents. The parents' innate guardianship of their children and the children's innate respect for their parents are quite precious "human nature." To be more rational, we should say that the parents' responsibility for their children is the natural order and an inescapable duty. "Who doesn't have children?" Let the children then be responsible for the next generation of children. Wouldn't that be better? — Humanity originally extends downward.</p>
<p>Thus, the question touches on how to be a good father and who supports the parents. To put it more broadly, this responsibility should be borne by society because everyone should be a healthy citizen and a healthy producer. The responsibility of raising and educating children should belong to society. To put it more narrowly, or to be more realistic in the current society, then there are indeed too many economic problems. "Children being exchanged for food has become a common news item, and having to leave one's hometown and wander elsewhere to find food and clothing is the most common phenomenon among young people in today's society. You say, how can one be a good father? And who should support the parents? How should these be answered?</p>
