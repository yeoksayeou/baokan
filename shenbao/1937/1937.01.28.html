<h3>錢江大橋覆輪慘案</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>錢江大橋自開始興築以來。工程進行。頗稱積極比以限期追近乃益加緊努力挖泥建墩漏夜從事寒宵風勁露重勞苦原已萬分不意夜渡不愼復肇覆輪之禍同舟百餘工人祇三十人獲救其餘悉付漂流截至最近打撈所得溺斃確數。已達七十八名。而一部被難工友。死生猶朱判明。綜計橋工七百餘名。死者竟佔十分之一。不可謂非驚人之慘劇矣。茲事發生以後。直接負責者。固應不勝其內心之疚痛。卽在異方人士。平日關懷較深。亦無不致其深切之同情。誠以錢江建橋一事。本非輕易克舉。其工程之偉大。實遐邇所具瞻。今竟逢此意外之不幸。小則挫沮工友之熱心。大則影響程功之進展。宜為一般人所難以釋然者。敢於善後辦理之始。路貢吾人一得之愚。</p>
<p>凡百艱險工程。原各有其阻力。要在主持者控制得宜。以免一切無謂之犧牲。卽就錢江橋工而論。過去亦未嘗無損害之事實。或屬於病氣之突發。或出於災變之波及。既非人力所能預防。亦唯有委諾天命而已。若今茲之事。則逈非昔比。以工人蜂擁上船。而致舵師心慌。以渡輪載重逾量。而致中途傾覆。出事之後。復未能有應急之措置。適當之救濟。坐令百餘壯健男子。僅極少數得免魚厄。則其平日訓練之不善。管制之弛懈。設備之缺乏。呼應之散漫。胥可知矣。過去責任。易之論。關於今後懲毖之道。自宜有切實之整頓。不僅深夜廣渡。應有妥善設備。卽屬其他意外。亦必曲經籌維。果人謀之已盡。斯身殉而無𡨚。此在當事者所當予以反復考盧者也。至死難工人。極應從優撫䘏。旣妥幽魂。亦勵生者。聞包商方面已允每人結䘏百五十元。還道代為運柩回籍。而杭總工會並擬呈請省府鐵部。救濟死難家屬。此固平允之要求。非同逾分之需索當局為督促橋工邁進計亦誠宜有立予承諾之必要</p>
<p>最後否人尚有一言橋工之尅期完成為今日唯一要義此次慘事發生非特不足為延宕之籍口且更應以兼程功力促成之蓋基於今回之教訓足徵輪渡之危險錢江在六和塔附近原為較狹淺之一段徒以逾載之故尚復有此寄厄。而義渡處江面遼闊。客如織。平日亦未當無爭先恐後之情形試一設想恐佈寗不更甚於彼欲掃蕩未來之危機唯有從速完成大橋傳側直遠通行而已更言死難諸人平日胼手胝足固在樂覩厥成今此雄偉傑出之橋。方具突兀天挺之勢而躬與版重之人未叨慶功之宴。先遭滅頂之凶九仭一簣之恨。長耿耿於黃泉。後死者能知以此為已任。盡其最大之努力。則於工程之裨補。必且大有增加。而諸工友在地下。亦可稍瞑目矣。</p>

<p>［東京］宇垣大將之組閣、參謀長今井田清德本日午後四時二十分在組閣本部發表談話如左、宇垣大將本日進宮、謂求給與數日之猶豫、所謂數日固可作二三日解釋、亦可作五六日解釋、但不宜以此言為斷、自當盡量圖獲迅速解决、斷不可长此作持久戰、二十八日當可達到最後期間、此言亦不能由余明白說山、至於所謂靜俟宮中方面之任何上諭、實未考盧及此、組閣工作逗延、致惹誤會而令人不安、至為惶恐、吾人之行動倘有增國民之危慮者、自應絕對避免、宇垣大將大致當採取任何行動、但其處置之結果、非愼重考慮不可、宇垣大將所考慮者、固與今日會晤內府之影響亳無關係、總之事態如何、不欲使用好轉或逆轉之字樣、大致吾人依照所思維者而發之於行動、原屬內部情勢若何而定、現在如何進行、當未便明言者也云（二十七日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］今井田清德午后十時又語人如左、今晚原擬促成組閣有所工作、但仍未出謀、當待明日、此處徹底依照圓滿解决之宗旨、以考慮一切、決不為欲得陸相計而行使任何法制上之手段、廿八日或可與陸軍幹部會見、亦未可料、惟此處盡量以協調精神謀解决、凡屬違背此種精神之某項决心或某項用意、决未考慮、海軍方面尚未答覆因尚未達到督促之時機也、此外並無任何先陸軍而後海軍之預定、總之、盡量從事圓滿協調以圖解決、斷不至利用任何例外方法、陸相問題亦須經三長官之同意、當以協調態度使達到目的、在未達目的以前、無論何時是否繼續此種狀態、或再懇猶豫、現令尚未預料及此、宇垣大將廿八日是否與湯淺內府會見或進謁、非至明日不得而知、蓋現在並無所謂預定行動也、至於用電文辦理入閣交涉、則毫無其事云云、（廿七日同盟電）</p>
<h3>陸軍聲明</h3>
<p>貫澈革新政治　絕無獨裁企圖</p>
<p>［東京］宇垣內閣因二十六日陸軍三畏官會議、宣告拒絕推薦候補陸相、遂逢着流產命運、陸軍方面認宇垣大將不得不拋棄組閣工作、而除拜辭大命之外、無其他方法、並解釋宇垣二十六日晚發表之聲明、為表示其拜辭大命之意者、陸軍方面拒絕內閣之原因、並非在於政綱政策等問題、乃由達成肅軍之目的上、認宇垣大將為不適當之人、其實際原因、在於宇垣個人的事情、故陸軍拒絕理由有絕對性質、毫無妥協餘地云、（二十七日向盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］自組閣大命降於宇垣大將以來、流布種種風說、有謂陸軍之態度、為阻止大權全圖獨裁者、又有謂其將謀財界之急激變革者、陸軍方面對此、於下述之見解之下、加以否認、且斷定此種風說、為故意中傷陸軍者、</p>
<p>㊀大權阻止　以現在之陸軍與宇垣大將之關係、為陸軍阻止大權之發動、然最初中島憲兵司令官以私人資格、於宇垣大將入京途上晤大將時、及宇垣大將訪問寺內大將時、均無勸其拜辭、又或以陸軍之總意或團體的壓力等、阻其組閣之事、僅詳細說明部內情勢並陳述無人允繼任陸相而已、而最後寺內大將訪問宇垣大將時、又報告已正式由三長官協議、選定陸相後任候補者、及向各候補者折衝之結果、故阻止大權妨害組閣等之非難、絕不得當、</p>
<p>㊁獨裁政治　陸軍對於政治方式、其不動之根本方針、於二十三日之聲明曾表明之、蓋始終在於恪遵帝國獨特之憲法、遂行正當之立憲政治、於目下情勢之下、惟有以此為基本、期望展開明朗積極之強力革新政治而已、絕無企圖獨裁之事、</p>
<p>㊂財界之變革　謂軍有斷行念激改革經濟界之決意、其結果必使財界陷於混亂者、此乃宣傳、蓋陸軍對於經濟問題之態度、鑑於目下逼迫之情勢、始終以避免混亂、以合法漸進為基調而謀應付、此與向來無殊者也、（二十七日同盟電）</p>
<h3>海軍當局暫不表明態度</h3>
<p>［東京］宇垣大將於二十五日下午會見永野海相、關於組閣問題、請求海軍當局之諒解、海相未與卽答、永野海相關於此問題、須與現在熱海地方避寒之伏見宮軍令部長商議、且有其他種種理由、其對於宇垣大將之回答、似不免遲廷、（二十七日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日本青年黨向寺內進言</h3>
<p>［東京］橋本欣五郎大佐所組織之大日本青年黨、今向寺內陸相提出條陳如左、</p>
<p>苟欲敷衍當前之政局、而誤及皇國前途、則斷然不許、放矢而逸革新之的、則其責任死亦雖償、吾人對於陸軍當局徹底革新在中樞推進力之歷史上大使命、以不向後轉之决心、蝎盡臣節之熱誠、表示滿腔贊意、仍望貫澈初衷、以圖邁進、是所切盼云云、（二十七日同盟電）</p>
<h3>財界希望</h3>
<p>出現強力內閣　政局早日安定</p>
<p>［東京］因陸軍方面拒絕推薦後任陸相、依目下之客觀情勢、宇垣內閣有流產之虞、惟隨政局之緊迫、財界所最注目者、厥為足以左右政局為現實勢力之陸軍之態度、蓋其政治目標及其革新動向之實體、足以决定今後財界之基调、而使全部神經尖銳集中、認新內閣之政策、必較諸從來更飛躍化、故所謂準戰時體制、必於政治經濟之兩分野更加推進、此為財界所引為豪者、故希望速由衆望所歸之強力內閣、收拾政局、安定時局、而明確其政治經濟之動向云、（二十七日同盟電）</p>
<h3>宇垣私邸闖入不速之客</h3>
<p>要求知難而退　比冠竟被毀損</p>
<p>［南京］宇垣大將今晨進宮會見湯淺內府大臣、協商打開組閣難關方策比返私邸、卽有不速之客三人尾隨入室、意欲不利於宇垣卒為宇垣衛士所扼、不得逞宇垣幸告無恙、但其絲質高冠已為損毀矣、三人現已就逮、係屬農工同盟會員、未挾武器、祇懷請願書一紙、要求宇垣知難而退、並無加害之意云、（廿七日國民電）</p>
<h3>日本全國工商會議結城會長重要演說</h3>
<p>防止顧大預算影響　促進中日親善關係　賛成美國經濟政策</p>
<p>［東京］東京商工會議所二十六日在工業俱樂部開全國商工會議所代表會議、在其席上會長結城豐太郎演說時局問題、其內容頗堪注目、結城略謂、政府為對付嚴重國際情形起見、編製本年度龐大預算、且企圖實施稅制改革、此實為不得已之情形、然其對於財界及產業界之影響極大、吾人當政府實行此預算時、須應設萬全之策、以防止其影響、由於預算膨脹、增稅計劃等發生之重大問題、乃是物價之騰貴、失物價勝貴、為現時世界的現象、然在日本發生不自然的物價騰貴、非但對於財界•產業界•及貿易界、有惡影響、且對於預算之實施、有重大障害者、頗為明顯、至於中日關係、中日兩應始終維持親善關係、然近來動輒彼此反目、實為余所遺憾者、余曾於新年宴會時、對於隣邦中國之識者及民衆致言、主張兩國經濟親交之必要、試觀最近國際通商情形、國家主義的經濟觀念、支配一般局面、而在國際之間、釀成不愈快的空氣、余信打開如此國際經濟之窮途、使通商關係明朗化、則能緩和緊張情形、對於世界和平、必有貢獻、因此企圖恢復國際經濟為現下之急務、在此意味上、余對於美國國務長官赫爾之言論、表示最大敬意、吾人提唱經濟親交時、應以互讓精神、進行交涉、以解决通商问題、中國問題等為要云、（二十七日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］力倡促進中日親善關係之日本商工會議所會長結城、於二十六日夜議員招待會席上、提倡日英經濟修好、惹起注目、先是、財界各方面已有派親善使節分赴各國之計劃、或意圖如對班皮英國經濟使師、富奧普斯美國經濟使節、吳鼎昌中國經濟使飾等、已定有派經濟答禮使師之計劃、其後因情勢發生變化、致不得已中止、未能實現、然財界各方面、如結城會長之演說、希望與上述各國之經濟提攜、頗為熱心、故俟目下政局安定、經濟親善答禮使節派遣計劃、勢必重提、尤其日本經濟聯盟、認為國際商會大會六月在柏林開會時、為對英美兩國派遣答禮使節之絕好機會云、（二十七日同盟電）</p>

<p>左手將軍烏承祥、昨晚在上海業餘擊彈高級錦標賽中、以一千比七百五十五點、擊敗蓋恩、到達複賽週、將與前晚克服丁明毅之朱其良奪複賽權、以昨晚烏氏之穏健優秀表演將來鳥朱之職大有一番可觀也、</p>
<p>鳥氏對蓋恩昨晚之戰、除最初之一百五十點時、蓋氏曾佔先四五十點之多、過此關後鳥氏遂入於康莊大道、一路風和日麗蓋恩祇能追隨而已惟亦有一二次緊張之時、則所距僅四五點耳、前半塲結束時、島以五百比四百七十佔先三十點、後半時鳥氏槍出更順、蓋恩成為強弩之末、結果以一千比七百五十五點得勝、最後一槍二十七分時已完成千點之且的、而此槍尚未結束也、</p>
<p>回憶聯賽比賽時、蓋總曾約張英達麥迭那等名將擊敗、了左手將軍以此成績戰勝之、益見難能可貴、</p>
<p>今日為張英達對却士姆之賽、仍分五時牛九时牛两塲、在原地南京路八十八號舉行、张氏得勝具有把握、茲錄鳥蓋兩氏、昨晚最大得點綠下、（鳥承祥）前塲、三四三七、四八、二三、二六、後塲、二九、三十、二二、二十五九、二四，二十、二七、</p>

<p>下半時</p>
<p>休息後、五龍改以劉景峯充衛、代招壽昌職、持志亦以陳學崇調下以高保生改跳中鋒、但未見得意、開始後、卽為五龍－鼓而增六分、成三十五比十六、持志追逐達二分鐘、方由張良雄雙手推入一球、旋又得一𠟟無如得不償失、五龍李祖德徐兆熊射無虛發、一轉瞬間、頻添十一分之多、四十六比十九、勝負早成定評矣、此後持志蘇英海王晋成相繼退出復以徐沛生及舒昌格調上、稍見好轉、徐南登卽建功、五龍李祖德亦命中、但持志徐詹又雙中、五龍復以招壽昌調上、仍難邊其銳氣、徐沛生張良雄又連中三球、追成三十一比四八頗具中興之象、惟時不我待、祇餘三分半鐘、持志諸將、復因操之過急、張徐高四次佳機、反失交臂、旋五龍徐兆熊又中、成五十比三十一後、卽以周學賢調登、雙方各無建樹、卽以此告終、五龍大勝、</p>

<h3>幾個有關英語教學的中等教育問題㈡</h3>
<p>— 王世杰</p>
<p>第二，中等教育所培養的知識、應當學理與實驗並重這一點在中國今日之中等學校更有特別注意的必要、幾千年以前就有一位大學者提出學而不思與思而不學的害處、勉勵人方面要用思想、一方面又要觀察事物、而中國向來研究學問的一種優美精神、就是身體力行、無奈數百年以來、因為中國的學問缺乏科學的成分就使學問之道大半流於空虛、注重理論而忽略實驗、結果是理論缺乏實驗的根據、這是中國學問界上一個積重難返的弊病、二三十年以來大家漸漸覺得這種害處頗能通力合作、力求矯正這種毛病、相當的成效已經漸漸顯著但是病根太深、非有比絞長時間的努力難收普遍的效果、這種毛病、在大學是如此、在中學恐怕只有更厲害、最近二四年以來、教育部對於這個問題作了一個相當普遍的測騐、就是中學與師範學校的畢業會考、大家對於這歷年會考統計的結果、也許多少已經注意到了、這個會考的用處、就是因為他不是限於其幾個學校或某幾個省市、乃是全國各地方各學校一個普遍的測驗、用比較可靠的方法指出全國中等教育有一個大缺點、就是凡是屬於理化和學等科舉的功課、一般學校的成續非常的壞、這是目前中等教育的一個根本問題、中等學校如此、高等教育固然逃不脫影響、而高等教育所能補救的亦屬有限、在目前要提倡科學教育、應當不只是以能仿照教程、做幾套實驗就算滿足、因為若沒有更深切更澈底的認識、這幾套實驗縱然做得好、也比會變幾套科學的戲法、高不了許多、所謂一種更深切更澈庭的認識、就是科學的態度、實驗的精神、照現在的情形看、太家已經認識這問題的重要、這是一件很可慶幸的事近數年來、無論在大學或中學、天家對於科學的設備、教材、教員與教授法都有相當的注意與努力、我們可以認定這只是一個有規模有系統的起點、在這幾方面若將中等學校與大學比較、全國的中等學校數目太多、其成績的水平綫、恐怕要比大學差得遠、將來中等學校更應當特別努力、這樣我們可以希望、全國學生的科學熊度，與實驗精神經過相當的培養、可以逐漸的提高、這種精神與態度、堅強的樹立於青年人的心理、不但於他們做學問有良好的基礎、並且可以養成誠實•忠信•負責•積極•謹守秩序、不肯茍且的修養與操行、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>紗市午後重振</p>
<p>生產雖速下跌亦難</p>
<p>紗市晨跌午順、但氣勢平靜、查多空兩方皆有相當敵力、印商派、對於二月期之多額、絲毫不願放棄、吸進之額、約有五萬包、套出三四月、亦有三四萬包之譜、照此情形而論、勢成騎虎、難以放鬆、至於同業鑒於紗廠生產增速、根子日鬆、現紗有剩積、大都抱逢漲拋賣主義也、</p>
<p>印商多頭維持</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月呈平定之象、一盤開拍一月期忽然下跌檺面轉趨鬆落、蓋以有一部份向廠方開進期紗、套出標紗、同時現銷不旺、加之大孤三品紗市受政潮影響、市價不穩、人心更挫、但印商對於二月期把持、仍不放棄也、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價跌七角至一元一角、午後開盤以三品紗市稍形回升、據云印商多頭不放手、檯面轉緊、市價賈復回止、結果各月比上午收盤價回漲五•八•九角、查賣出裕大三千一百包、裕康五百包、振大七百五十包、森康一千零五十包、愼記一千六百包、仁豐八百包元一四百五十包、大昌成一千一百五十包、大𠰦二千一百五十包、生源七百包、買進合興一千二百五十包、錦昌二千一百五十包、明德一千四百包、豐壽五百包、益昶一千五百五十兇、潤康一千二百五十包、同和一千一百五十包、長豐六百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>棉市徘徊帶疲</p>
<p>棉市絕無生氣終日不脫盤旋徬徨之象、塲內賣買日趨澹泊、多空俱抱觀望態度、又值廢歷年暮之際、多數準備總結賬矣、市價更無精彩可言云、</p>
<p>標棉進出兩稀</p>
<p>標棉前市開盤、各月一致下降氣勢疲憊不振、蓋以現棉廠方實需呆滯、兼之紗市回較、人心愈弱、但塲內交易殊少進出、市盤益覺疲乏、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌五分至一角、午後開盤市况毫無進出、交易極少、拍板時間僅四十分鐘、遂告收盤矣、結果二月比上午收盤介漲一角半、其餘勿動、查賣出仁豐一千九百担、春昌一千二百担、生源一千担、永昌一千担、大孚一千一百担、永大一千一百担、同和一千一百担、買進泰與三千一百担、望泰興一千担、益康二千八百担、合興一千六百担、大昌成一千担、日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>乾繭之出口觀</h3>
<p>— 金聲</p>
<p>邇來乾繭出口問題甚嚴塵上，有謂装運國外裂造軍火，有謂本市絲廠被迫停車，議論紛紛，莫衷一是，本市絲廠同業公會曾開緊念會議，設法制止，八日申報本埠增刋，復載有劍平君鉅額乾繭裝運出口之談言，對於國計民生，多所論列，然此僅就表面觀察而言，倘以嚴格之眼光觀之，其癥結所在，似不在一絲繭商之見利忘義，實繁全國絲廠業命脈之存亡，本文作者，從業絲廠有年，對此問題，頗感討論與趣，爰主管見所及，約略言之，當為關懷絲業者所樂聞，亦聊供政府機關之參考。</p>
<p>查本市絲廠練額，雖有百餘家，但實際祇五六十家，開工者四五十家，其餘之廠，拆卸者有之，改組布廠者有之，或改營其他工廠者又有之，此無他，經營者之不易得手耳。</p>
<p>絲廠出品之優劣，企視機械之良寙，目下浙省府經營之絲廠，多已改裝最新式多條車，民營者亦由政府貸欵裝設新式機車，無錫絲業鉅子薛壽萱氏經營之各廠，曁新創之興業公司，亦相率改為多條車及重繅車，本市則不然，除寶泰，怡和，積餘，中興等五六廠已改裝半新式之重繅車外，多數仍為數十年前義大利式之絲車，從事繅絲，反視車隣五年前認為最新式之御法川式之多條車，今已視為陳舊，由增潭公司所出之新式機取而代之矣。</p>
<p>絲廠機械之重要，旣如上述，今本市絲廠，以老式之機械，製絲勻度，旣難合格，絲身又鮮清潔，故乾蔭之裝運出口，在作者理想，當為國外機械較新，技術較良，需要上等原料，運往繅製高級蠶絲，較為合理，以言製造軍火，殊屬未敢臆勵，蓋蠶絲為我國出口大宗，繭而能製軍火，絲又何嘗不能，由此觀之，是絲亦不能出口矣，故作者以為乾滿出口，非特不足悲觀，且引為慶幸，良以世界產絲國家，當以東隣之產量為最當，原料亦最優，此次購繭者不求之日本，而購諸我國，足見我國乾繭原料，身骨極優，尚兄為國外所採取，此後我國蠶絲應如何加以改良，力求精進，是在經營絲廠者之努力。</p>
<p>上年春夏秋蠶晚秋四季，全國乾繭產量，約計三十萬担，此次裝運出口者，㨜運日報載祇千餘担，尚不足百分之一，所望絲廠同業公會領袖諸公，勿以禁止出口為已盡人事，應卽從事調查國外購繭之用途，如果確係運往繅絲，應領導全國絲廠業急起直追，如保改良機械，如何增進技術，俾免目下百分之一之出口，一變而為源源出口，則絲業前途，庶幾有豸。</p>
<p>據作者所知，本市絲廠被迫停五之原因，不並在原料告盤，而在購價不符，目下本市暨無錫兩處棧中堆存乾繭，尚有萬擔之譜，無奈現時乾繭市價，每擔須國幣二百元，以四百三四十斤原料繅絲一擔計算，須合繭本八百數十元，再加其費七八十元，則每擔絲之成本，須合九百余元，按照現在普通絲價，每擔祇八百元左右，非特無利可圖，且須虧及成本，是經營絲業者不得不另開蹊徑，以圖生存，至於銷售國外之是高級蠶絲，每擔雖亦有九百餘元之價格，但繅製此項蠶絲，必須有最新式之機械，及受有相當訓練之工人，始克有濟，矧自政府實施生絲檢驗以還，本高絲廠之出品，自稔難以及格，多視外銷為畏途，不得已而思其次，惟有銷售於國內織綢廠，此種現象，要亦無可諱言。</p>
<p>關於禁止出口一層，似非澈底辦法，蓋關係國計民生事業之原料，不僅乾繭一項，例如關係民食之麵粉廠，未嘗禁止小麥出口，關係民生之紡織廠，亦未禁止棉花出口，今以少數之乾繭出口，認為非常重要，誠屬舍本逐未，騰笑異邦，今試出證昔年雙宮絲廠之事實，可資借銳，當民廿年春，本市共有雙宮絲廠六家，當時羣謀禁止雙宮繭出口，俾原料充足，得以自給，一面呈請政府增加捐稅，以免外運，致雙宮繭每擔原繳稅銀三兩者，一躍而增至十一兩，其實作繭自縛，曾幾何時，此六家雙宮絲廠，多不勝負擔，相繼停閉，目下所存者僅有一家，尚在力圖掙扎，在雙官絲廠設想之初，以為盡善，詎料本身之實惠未受，同業之報害已嘗，現今絲廠商每年擔負雙宮捐稅之損失，不下數十萬元，不可謂非鉅數，故年來繭商不惜將上好雙宮繭，變作削口廢繭裝運出口者，比比皆是，卽此一端，可為明證。</p>
<p>綜上結論，此項乾繭出口，應從根本上謀救濟方法，决非閉關自守，反造成为淵敺魚，為叢敺爵之現象，作者妄參末議，試述補救辦法如下。</p>
<p>㊀“推廣製種”使本市絲廠商及繭行行主，從而過問蠶種情況，不致隔閡。</p>
<p>㊁養蠶合作與產銷合作，以免繭商屯積居奇。</p>
<p>㊂“政府應以國際市塲規定本國繭價蠶絲價”，不能以日本及美國交易所市價作為標準，因上年春秋兩季，每擔均抬高五六十元。</p>
<p>㊃“改善機械”，各絲廠所有老式機械，須從事改善。</p>
<p>㊄“培植技術人員，改良工人技術”，使出品日益精進。</p>
<p>㊅“由政府統制販賣機關，設立國外推銷所”，使全國絲繭貿易得以統一。</p>
<p>凡此諸端，胥關大計，際此歡歲伊始，百度維新，倘能努力進行，則一切問題不難迎刃而解，作者管窺蠡測，所見甚微，海內宏達，衍而廣之，則幸甚矣。</p>

<h3>卡汾狄許</h3>
<p>— 嵩山</p>
<p>Henry　Cavendish　1731-1810</p>
<p>英國的大化學家兼物理學家卡汾狄許於一七三一年十月十日生於奈斯（Nice)。一七四二年他被送到海克尼（Hackney）的一個學校裹去讀書；一七四九年進劍橋大舉。他不等到取得學位，便離開劍橋，到巴黎去專攻算學和物理。</p>
<p>直到四十歲時他還是很可憐地從他父親那裹取得很少的費用來過日子，到了晚年，他才承繼了大宗的遺產。久做竄措大的他，一朝暴富，要他學處置金錢，裝點門面，更令他感覺麻煩，加重了他的癖性。他非常討厭交際，除參加皇家學會的會議和會員組織的俱樂部裹第星期四的聚餐外，什麼應酬他都拒絕，他彷彿要竭力避免別人對他的注意。就是他的親戚，也難得和他相遇；他每年只許他的承繼人會面縱分鐘。</p>
<p>他越來越討厭見人，他把每天所需的飯菜，寫在一張紙條上，放在大廳的桌子上面，讓女僕來拿去照辦。如果女僕給他看见了，定要被辞退的。他最喜欢吃羊腿。有一天，一个客人留在他家裹用膳，女僕隔牆問他用什魔菜欵待客人，他說，“自然羊腿呀！”女僕急着問，“單一隻羊腿怎麽够呢？”他沉下臉說，“那麽两隻好啦！”</p>
<p>他的個子又長又瘦且穿的衣服都是極老式的，而且老是不換。當裁縫來替他量尺寸時，他却故意穿上破衣。他說話時遲遲疑疑，在人家面前總是顯出那副無地自容的害羞樣子。他因為怕見女人，沒有結婚。他生平只有一張寫照，那是一位熱心的畫師，先愉量他的衣帽，後來再暗地裹補畫上眉目的。</p>
<p>一八一○年二月二十四日，他在克萊番（Capham)靜靜地死了。遺產很多：備欵有七十萬金鎊，每年地產牧入也有八千金鎊，還有五萬金鎊仔在他自己的銀行裹。死後屍體葬在都卑（Derby)的萬聖寺（All　SaintsCburcb)裹。一九二七年愛敬他的人們在他的墓上立一座碑來紀念他。</p>
<p>卡汾狄許的科學工作是非常廣泛的，但他活著時出版的著作却不多。等他死後，許多研究所得才公開於世。他對於皇家學會第一次的買南是一本化學的著作，名呌“人造空氣”（Facoitous　Airs)，裹面大部分是討論“燃氣”（氫氣）和“定氣”（二氧化碳）。他是第一個認識氫是一種元素的人。他發明了空氣中各成分氣體的比重，和這些氣體在不同液體中的溶解度。他查察出從腐爛和發酵所得的“定氣”與從白堊中得到的“定氣”有相同的性質。他對於科學的實驗方面也有很大的改良，如乾燥劑的利用和壓力溫度對於氣體體積的修正。後來他又發表了一篇論文，題目是“倫敦用水之分析，”內中說含石灰的水能吸收“定氣”；石灰和“定氣”結合成白堊，可隨水中原有的白堊，一併沉澱出來。一七八三年他研究大氣的組成試驗空氣幾乎整整地化了六十天工夫。一七八一年他才决定以前所得的比例是不错的，並且知道在各個不同地方的空氣沒有多大差異。</p>
<p>過了三四年，他的論文，“空氣的實驗”陸續山版，內中包含他的大發見：水的性質和硝酸的組成，以前瓦爾太爾（John　Warlure)曾做了一個實驗：將空氣和氣混合，再通電火花，結果原有體積減少而起水霧。卡汾狄許將這實驗仔細地重做一遍：將二分的氫與五分的空氣混合燃燒，結果產生了水；他又將氫和氧混合於特製玻璃器中，通過電火花，結果也得到水。在這實驗中他發見在生成的水中含有硝酸。在第二篇論文中，他說到他發現硝酸成分的方法。他又發現“不燃氣體”中之一百二十分之一是他種氣體，與已知的幾種氣體不同。一百年後才發現的氬實在是他提示的呢。</p>
<p>雖然他信“燃素說”，但不像普利斯特力（Priestley)那樣的固執，他的論文“氣體的實驗”裹面，曾說到許多自然現象，可以用拉瓦錫（Lavoisier)的學說來解釋。不過他仍不承認拉瓦錫的學說，依舊用他的“燃素說”。</p>
<p>卡汾狄許關於電學的著作除了兩篇不重要的論文外，在一八七九年由馬克斯威爾（JamesC　Maxweu）編成，“卡汾狄許先生的電學研究”。從這書裹，我們可以曉得他已預先成就庫倫（Coulomb)法拉第（Fataday）諸人的研究工作了。他曾經研究過蓄電器的電容量，靜電放電的能力，而且也曾預先知道歐姆（Ohm)定律呢！</p>
<p>他也研究過熱，如果他能很怏的發表他的結果，無疑地他可以在勃來克（Joseph　Black)之前取得潛熱及比熱的發見者的實座了。一七八三年他發表一篇討論關於水銀冰點的論文，對於熱之流動說（Fluid　Theory　of　Heat)表示懷疑。他最後的收穫是决定地球密度的實驗，所用的儀器由米開爾牧師（Rev•John　Michell贈給他的。起初他以為地球的密度是5、48但經了二十九次實驗的結果，所得的平均是5.448。他後期的工作是討論極光的高度，及對於天文儀器的改良。</p>
<p>喬治威爾遜（George　Welson)為他寫的傅記於一八五一年在卡氏學社出版了。包含卡氏所有問世的和未發表的作品。卡氏所用過的一部分儀器現在還保存在英國皇家學會為了紀念這位先哲起見，第逢州（Devonshive)七世公替他建了一所“卡汾狄許物理實驗室”。他把卡氏遺留下來的著作保留在皇家學會裹。－九二一年又把他從前已發表的和未發表的實驗編篡起來、名叫“卡汾狄許論文集”，包含了“電學研究”和“化學及力學研究”二卷。</p>
<p>卡汾狄許是一個非常偉大的科學家，只可惜他的脾氣太怪，不肯及時發表，把許多重要發見擱下來，因此不能享受盛名。否則我想他和牛頓爵士比，恐怕有過之而無不及呢！</p>

<h3>怎樣研究哲學（八）</h3>
<p>— 嚴以霖</p>
<p>夫署　三江書店發行</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>本書的最主要的特徵是客觀的說明哲學的研究方法，和哲學內容概要以及哲學發展史的槪要。甚至在說明哲學究竟為如何科學時，或者為什麼應當研究哲學時，也是用其客觀的見地。比如說：對於“哲學”這詞所下的解釋，那就是站在客觀的立塲上面說話的，這是一看正確的具體的敘述，就可知道的。倘若你去閱讀唯心論的哲學，它一開頭就把導入虛渺幽會的世界，使人莫測其高深，這自然並不是閱者的程度問題，而實在因為其內容沒有確切的根據，要是把其神祕的外衣脫去，其理論之空虛處，就無法遮蓋。但這並不是說唯心論者之故弄玄妙，乃是因為他們沒有保持正確的研究態度，以及許多客觀的原因將他們推到哲學的岐途上去。</p>
<p>在論究為什麼應當研究哲學時，也一樣地用了客觀的說法，作者就闡明哲學研究的要求，乃是人類實際生活的誘導和逼迫所引起的，而且說因為寫了實踐也有研究哲學的必要。這種具體的說法根本上是由客觀方面出發的。</p>
<p>因為本書是以科學的觀點來談論研究方法，所以就特別注意實證的和經驗的方法。於是乎就主張運用客觀的鏡子於哲學的研究中，要理解各時代的自然哲學，就要求證於那時代所能發掘和認知的自然事物之真象中，要理解各時代的社會哲學，就要借助於社會的視實事變這把鏡子，在社會基礎上去求哲學思想之本質，形熊，理論的實證。而且必然地更以實踐為研究實證方法之一，認實踐為使理論體系從固有的階段發展到新的階段的唯一的高級研究方法。</p>
<p>這種科學論的觀點是通過了全書每一第每一章，也就是說作者是站在正確的立塲上，來談“怎樣研究哲學，和哲學內容綱要及其發展史綱要。</p>
<p>本書旣然以科學的研究法來談論哲學，它必然地含有“批判”的意義；這也是本書的主要特徵之一。含有“批判”意義的，才是一種好的入門書。我們讀到各科的入門書，往往感到一種很大的遺憾，——就是說，入門書的內容常只是混亂地堆積許多不同的見解，它的作者只是像留聲機那樣傳放各種不同的聲音，使初學者莫知滴從，尤其是內容繁複的哲學入門書，更容易犯這個毛病。本書旣然是含有“批判”的意義的，自然能使初學者直接地走進門去，理解其基本的學派的得失，不至於作一種徒然的徘徊，或者錯迷於各種學派的理論，不知所從：甚至於不幸地跑上岐途。</p>
<p>作為本書另一的主要特徵，乃是它無意中將讀者導入正確的哲學思想裹去。這種“領導”的作用原是站在正確的立塲上說話的，和含有“批判”意義的入門書給與讀者的必然影響。給其實是著作者的正當的任務；著作者寫了一本書，散佈於世間，自然要它是有益的。尤其是所謂入門書，是必需將讀者引到正確的思想中，或者給予讀者以基本的百系統的知識，這才算盡了它的任務。</p>
<p>以上是本畫內容方面的主要特徵，此地將其形式方面來考察一下。</p>
<p>形式方面的最主要特徵，是形式極緊縮的這回事。這又可分兩方面來說，其一，就其全書的組織而言，因其敘述上的次序，是循着正確的綫索的，所以覺得異常的精密。尤其是當談着哲学綱要的時候，正像植物學者欲知道樹的年紀，而看見了樹身的橫剖面的年輪一樣，使讀者對於“哲學”這一學科有了極正確的認識和理解。本書用了極少的篇幅，來講解哲學內容的槪要：它一方面提示了哲學內容的要點，他方面則提出哲學學派的兩大基本營的對於哲學根本命題的見解。這種具體的釋要的解釋方法無疑是最經濟的。當說明哲學發展史的概要時，也是用了那樣經濟的手段。它將哲學發展史的時期作一種新的劃分，這是合理的經濟的敘述法。而且在敘述中，隨時注意於唯心論和唯物論兩大派歷史上的起伏與其進展的恣態。其二乃是文字的緊湊與簡明。它雖則反覆地說明着哲學的研究方法，和哲學綱要，我們讀閱時只覺得其緊凑，簡明，因為這種說明上的反覆，並不是回歸而是更高的進展。總之，形式的緊縮常是提其網要的說明的要素，使讀者加重了注意力，所得的效果是很速地與人以正確的理解，不致使人因其叔述上次序之混亂而陷入迷途的狀態。所以說一本好書是决定於其內容和形式兩者的優劣，而優美的形式也是好書的必要件。</p>
<p>綜觀全書，內容方面的特徵是客觀的來談論哲學研究方法，網要及其發展史，是含有“批判”的意義的，是把讀者導入正確的哲學思想中的；形式方面的特徵是有着极经濟的形式的。這些特徵所在，也就是它的價值所在。（完）</p>
<h3>袁英昌的孔雀東南飛及其他（四）</h3>
<p>— 夔風</p>
<p>二、其他獨幕劇</p>
<p>D總的劇體</p>
<p>袁昌英創作各獨幕劇的意識作用，在第一節經是可以見到大略。各劇的時代意義與價值可不用眼前來置啄。</p>
<p>然而，拿現在的眼光，來批評各劇的技巧，有些地方是不能已於言的。</p>
<p>劇本除了作為演出的以外，尚有作為唸的劇本的話，我可以不用贅言什麼。但是，沒有一個劇作不是希望能够演出的，否則的話然失掉了劇的本身意義。</p>
<p>遺憾的是，這五個獨幕劇多半是不合予舞台技巧的。摘要的說，如活詩人，前方戲士兩劇裹，就有極大的問題。活詩人中黃狗捕貓一段，恐絕無實現的可能；前方戰士中孫中山先生陰靈顯現，一幕中有兩段這樣塲面的插入，外加（背幕上隱隱的：旣出一片汪洋大海；海上暴風疾雨，爭相震怒；雷鳴海吼，號動人地，在這陰慘慘狂波逐浪的海上隱隱浮着一隻大船，船上滿装着駿得面面相视，蹙首蹙额的生靈。船在海中間，飄搖不定。顯然有堲沉之勢，祇有一根索子在岸上，彼一羣人拚命地拖拽着。岸上的人之中，一個特别現得魁梧堂皇的樣子。这明明白白是孫中山先生。……）</p>
<p>这些应属於舞台效果，但這樣的舞古效果，往往演西遊記神鬼戲之類的轉台，是话剧裏所做不來的。同時，这一种近於幻覺表現的戲，不是話劇所應該用的手法。</p>
<p>當然，以目前的眼光來批判，是不易公正。不過，舉其顯見的缺點來說，就當時情形，恐也是不合於舞台演出的戲吧</p>
<p>作者對於創作戲劇努力，在這本冊子裹，是可以窺見的。在當時，作者這一點成績，也許是很難得的收穫。以史的眼光來批判，袁氏能够暴露當時的社會諸相，自有他不可埋沒的價值。對於這樣一位劇作者，我們是極其希望她繼續努力。多創作一些切合目前時代需要的劇本來。</p>
<p>最近在大公報，文藝欄，讀到袁氏近作一首獨幕劇體的散文詩玄武湖濱。顯見作者仍然未忘情於劇的創作。可是，玄武湖濱，這類型的題材，和表現方法，姑不論合於時代需要與否，文本身給我們的食糧，的確是不够的。</p>
<p>一個跟蹤時代前進的文學工作者，一方固然有他的獨特的理想，一方更應復環顧下現實。這是我讀了袁昌英氏新舊劇作的一個感想。</p>
<p>附注：個人讀書很少，雜誌圖書瀏覽的機會不多，料想袁氏尚有其他未為我發見的劇作。本文論點，讓非概括袁氏所有的戲劇作品，應特申明。（完）</p>
<h3>“貨幣的故事”（上）</h3>
<p>— 玉坡</p>
<p>商務出版</p>
<p>英國的政論家兼經濟學家諾門·盎傑爾的貨幣的故事一書，可稱為一部極有價值和趣味的，經濟學常識的書籍。關於貨幣的記載•歷史•及其意見一類的書籍，已刊行於世界上的何止千數百種；但是，牠們不是因了村料過於專門，便是因了見解過於高深，或是文字過於枯澀，不容易為一般人所能理解。中有這部貨幣的故事，却不曾有同類書籍所具的缺點，所以，容易為一般讀者所閱讀，所能理解。我們因了這書的故事體裁和淺明的文字，所以，能一氣讀完，趣味橫溢；不僅知道了世界各地古今貨幣的各種情形和各個故事，而且明瞭了關於貨幣的原則和理論，更聯帶的獲得了些經濟學的常識。確磁，牠對於我們讀者，是盡了趣味和知識的能事</p>
<p>這並不是著者寫作這本書的偶然的成續，却是由於他的有意，所以，能依照他的計劃而達到完美的目的。他在序文裹，已明顯說出他的寫作主旨：㊀人類對於貨幣之經驗；㊁人類對於貨幣之幾種重要的試驗及其給果：㊂人類在貨幣上所犯之種種謬誤。此外，他對於材料的援用，亦預先定有這樣的標準：“本書完全為一般人而作，凡性贊上過於專門者，除為了解根本問題所必要外，莫不力事避免。”他依照着自已的宣佈的寫作主旨和標準來寫作，所以，大告成功。</p>
<p>現在，讓我們概要的談談這本書的內容吧。全書包括十四章，從貨幣的形成最初的貨幣，貨幣的借貸及其利息，隨賃幣而產生的紙幣，直到現代貨幣機構的崩潰，及貨幣的改革意見等，凡是關於貨幣的史事，現象，及一切問題，都經論到，可算完倫之至。在這上四章中間，以“最初之貨幣”章為最饒興趣；著者採論文體裁，以說明貨幣的定義相機能，用故事體裁以敘述世界各地最初貨幣的形式，質料，及其價值，信用等。至於著者對於貨幣定義的見解，是頗很正確的。他這樣說着：</p>
<p>所谓貨幣者，必具四條件，卽：㊀能輾轉流通支付物價與其銀者；㊁收受之時，卽以預備支付他人者；㊂收受之時，對於其質與量，無須予以特別之檢查輿佔量者；㊃收受之時，對於對方信用，無須過問者。（見第七十二頁）</p>
<p>本來，貨幣的定義是最難說明的；這是因不能用一詞概括貨幣的一切現象的緣故。但是，著者却能從上述的四條件去說明貨幣的廣泛意義，可說是難能而貴的。再者，他更從貨幣的機能方面，去補充上面的定可義，這對於他的定義，有了更明白的解釋。他說：</p>
<p>至於貨幣之機能，則一般之定義，大抵認為交易之中介，價值之尺度，償債標準，價值之積聚。換言之，能盡中介，尺度，標準，積聚四種功能者，卽為貨幣。</p>

<h3>特種現金保證辦法續</h3>
<p>銀行公會發表全文</p>
<p>“特種現金保證辦法”之提要㊀甲種保證金、（照行員月薪三倍之數計算）</p>
<p>本金離行時、全數發還利息按年息一分二厘計算、半數發給行員、半數充公共準備金、</p>
<p>㊁乙種保證金、（照行員月薪百分之二計算）</p>
<p>此項保證金、為取消保人之代替物、亦卽等於團體信用之保證費、本無須發還、惟體恤行員起見、如無舞弊案件發生、於離行時、可以全數領回、或除攤賠外、收回其餘額、</p>
<p>㊂內種保證金　中銀行當局核定若干萬元、或為甲種保證金利息半數及乙種保證金全數之和、查上三項保證公共準備金、假定全行員生總數一千八百人、全年薪金總額一百六十萬元、則第一年司得十萬餘元、五年後連利息計算在內、可得約八十萬、元、</p>
<p>㊃連帶處分　行員舞弊案發牛後、在同一行處之其他行員、有下列情形之一者、應受連帝處分、其辦法按照行員獎懲規則規定辦理之、</p>
<p>一、同一行處、共同或連帶經手辦理該項職務者、</p>
<p>二、同一行處之直接主管者、</p>
<p>三、其他經董事長總經理核定應受連帶處分者、</p>
<p>㊄獎勵告發　行員舞弊、經主管者及其他行員查覺或告發、使行方不受或减少損失時、其察覺或告發者、除得免除連帶處分外、行方并應予以獎勵、其辦法按照行員獎懲規則規定辦理、惟告發案經查明不實者、由當局處分之、</p>
<p>“特種現金保證辦法”之方案</p>
<p>行員服務保證規則</p>
<p>第一條　本行行員服務之保證、依照本規則辦理、</p>
<p>前項所稱行員、本行全體員生均屬之、</p>
<p>（說明）本條第二項為行員之定義、將本規則施行之範圍與對象、予以確切之規定、以杜施行時解釋上之爭論、</p>
<p>第二條　行員應按月薪三倍之數額、繳納甲種保證金、</p>
<p>（說明）本辦法之特點、在於取消保人、故必須繳納相當現金、以資保證數額規定為月薪之三倍、限度不高、事實上並無困難比之覓保便易甚多、且保證金及利息之一部、（參閱第五條）將來可以發還、於行員本身、尤屬有益無損、茲假定全年薪金總額為一百六十萬元、則行方除集有保證金四十餘萬元外、年可得利息二萬四千餘元、作為本行預防舞弊損失準備金之一部、保障可謂鞏固、（聞英國密特蘭銀行等、亦有此項類似之辦法）</p>
<p>為保障鞏固起見、甲種保證金限額、原可規定一律繳納一年或半年之薪額、惟恐在此社會經濟極度困窘之時、大多數身家平平之行員、籌措不易、故㪸酌情勢、規定月薪之三培、以期切實易行、倘仍恐行員籌欵不易實行時可將原已扣存之儲蓄金撥充、或在年終獎勵金內扣撥、或分期繳納亦無不可、</p>
<p>第三條　行員未按照前條規定總納甲種保證金以前、槪不指派職務、</p>
<p>（說明）本條規定、完全與現行保證規則第二條性質相同、良以強行規則行員均有遵守之義務、而特種現金保證制度、又屬新創之辦法、欲期收效、必須嚴厲執行、故必俟繳納甲種保證金後方可指派職務、</p>
<p>第四條　行員繳納之甲種保證金、由總行發給行員甲種保證金存摺、此項存摺不得轉讓或抵押、</p>
<p>（說明）發給保證金存摺、為行方收到保證金之憑證、禁止轉讀或抵押、所以保障保證金之鞏固、</p>
<p>第五條　行員甲種保證金、由總行專戶存儲、利息按年息一分二厘計算、每半年複利一次、惟行員應得之利息、為年息六厘、其餘之六厘、則撥充行員保證準備金、（參閱本規則第十一條）</p>
<p>（說明）因甲種保證金利息之半數、須充行員準備金、但行方為使行員並不因此遭受損失起見、故特將利息予以提高、俾雙方兼顧、候將來銀行利息減低時、亦可酌减至規定、以證金利息半數、撥充行員保證金利息、所以使行員繳納之保證金、不致完全盧擱、以半數撥充保證準備、所以增厚保證之力量也、</p>
<p>第六條　行員薪級、如有增減、或職務變更時、應按照第二條規定將甲種保證金數額分別追加或退減之、</p>
<p>（說明）金額旣規定為月薪之三倍、則行員薪級或職務如有變動、保證金額自應隨之增減、（未完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>日本的躍進</h3>
<p>— 汶</p>
<p>隣邦日本今次第七十届的議會中，掀起了軒然的大波。結果是內閣總辭戰。作為這次變動的主要勢力的軍部，在他們所發表對政治的意見中，說：今後的內閣必須能正確認識時代，以利日本之躍進云。對於友邦的“躍進”，我們不能不留意一下的。</p>
<p>論到友邦近代躍進的歷史，有些地方使人確乎不能不對它欽佩。以中日一戰，再加日俄一戰，再加上一七一四—一八年四年間歐洲大戰的機會，日本是在飛速的進程中發展着了。到今日，它並是多了一個“人民三千萬，無苦無憂”的“滿洲皇道樂七”，為其龐然的附庸，看现势，它已發展到不能再發展了。只是，帶著這個一貫的軍事上勝利的躍進而來，也招到了國內國外更多冤家與敵人。比如，在國內就是犧牲了人民的最低生活要求而維持其超過其他各國過度膨大的軍事預算的。而在國外，美國蘇聯不必說，就是歐戰前後一向和好的英國，也對它好不自在了。更重要的，中國是否長此靜默，更是一個大問題，使躍進中的日本日夜耽心着，眼不安枕。這種種，都說明與日本飛速躍進而偕來的，另一方面是可怕的國內國外種種的威脅。這情形，當然不能使正在躍進中的日本，就此半途後退，唯一的辦法，是只求更躍進。中國有句俗話，呌做“一不做，二不休”，又說：“騎虎難下”，只有驅虎噬人的一法了。日本軍部所以在此時日本已無可躍進的候時而還要其更躍進，意義就在於此。</p>
<p>丟開民族的仇恨，就文化上說，日本近世紀的飛速進步，不能不使我們敬欽。也就為此，對於近十餘年來日本走上了不能不更躍進，騎虎難下的情形下，我們也甚為日本近年所接受的西洋文化而惋惜。過去，日本接受外來文化，算現在世界中最活躍最前進的一個國家，多少我國人從日本文化來間接承受了西洋文化，而現在呢，誠如周作人先生所說：“只有武化可言”了—這一點，在日本還要向軍事冒險躍進的人物，是不覺其可悲的，而就純正的文化立塲說，有希望的日本思想家，從事文化工作，却不得不引以為是一件可痛的事罷。</p>
<p>在軍事冒險主義之下牽着走的友邦國策，我們眞為其萬分危險的前途而擔憂。只是，這個擔憂，却先要挨到我們自己身上来。看今後日本的躍進，別的道路不會再有。有，就是我們莽莽的神州大陸罷。這里，躍馬橫戈，僅够友邦軍大展威風的地盤。來罷，他處多荊棘，唯此獨坦途！只是，能否坦到底，這要先請你們留心着，莫要“六十歲老娘倒繃孩兒”，那時才後悔無及！</p>
<h3>九龍城</h3>
<p>— 玉路</p>
<p>從香港渡海，到油蔴地，或者到尖沙咀，都可以換乘“巴士”（BUS）到九龍城。</p>
<p>到香港來遊歷的人，大概總會聽見過這地方的人介紹：</p>
<p>“我們去看宋皇台啊！還有，不要忘記到九熊城食雲吞（餛飩），那是頂有名的。而且，還有那剛從田裹折上來的油菜，或者白花芥蘭，那更有味極了。……</p>
<p>廣東人愛吃，勝地也常以“吃”起家的。這樣一說，人自然便動心的了。因為在廣州，也許游客們還會懷幕着那小北，和沙河的田裏新鮮的菜呢。因此，只要是曾聽過這介紹詞的，總想着到這麼一個地方去玩一下子。於是，沒有什麼困攤，只要有錢便可以起程了。</p>
<p>在巴士上，越過了馬路，到郊外來了。生客們是最容易把九龍塘當做九龍城的，因為那名字是多麼類似啊。然而，只要是一個虛心的遊客，巴士的賣票員常常便是最好的響導了。</p>
<p>沿路，我們看到在開鏧中的黃泥堆成的山，也看見田野，這樣我們是向着九龍城進發了。</p>
<p>巴士到了站，面前橫着一幅温漫的常綠的田野而第一个觸入我們眼簾的，却常常是那用繳皮製的，非常之大的××飛機塲的廣告牌。它告訴着二般支那人，那兒有一個“皇家的”（𧥶）飛機塲，而飛機塲却附股有一個機師的訓練班，只要有錢，皇家簽暑的證書便可以在“調練期滿”後到手了—可是，你要明白：九龍城不是租借地啊。</p>
<p>下了車，田野的愉悅的風會使人感到了一種清新的氣味。給都市的煤烟薰塞了的鼻扎，或呼吸器官，這兒會给你一種另外的說不出那麼地舒適的補償。茅屋，和簡陋的房子，也是在這華麗的香港不曾見過的。用一句俗氣的話來說，這兒完全是“中國味”（註）的。正因為此，也許給人的快感，會超於這島埠的一切的罷。</p>
<p>——這不僅僅是鄉下嗎？</p>
<p>對。是鄉下，是給別人凱覦着的地帶。它，這有點使人懷慕着還是樂園的鄉下，如今只為了因它靠近着租借地的香港和九龍半島，它也就受到了我們這國家的一般命運——被欺侮與被侵佔了</p>
<p>但是，偶然的過客是不會想到這些的，他們只會就便地詢問七人：吃的地方在那裏？</p>
<p>吃的地方，那是一家小村裹的茶館彷彿的小茅屋，前面的門看到後面的門，很小，裝置也很簡陋，幾張木檯，和一些橫七豎八的板凳。沒有什麼誇耀的廣告，甚至連招牌也省略了。然而足以作號召的却有那環繞這小店三面的菜田，田裹的油菜花茂盛地開着，样子已够诱人。還有一面，是前門，迎着大路；後門却通着一條田畦，一直走還有一家“老店”。</p>
<p>人客來到，企堂（堂倌）是堆着笑臉來招呼的。這裹的食品很簡單，只有炸雲吞，蝦仁炒麵，云吞麵，錦鹵之類。但，光是這幾式，也够使人滿足了。在熱天，因為在香港歇夏的人很多，所以他們的生意最降盛。有時人客高興，檯凳還可以放到外邊，甚至田畦上來。冬天雖不十分冷，有風總不是生意經，這時候他們是呌做“淡市”的。</p>
<p>有時，一些好事的人客或者間他們，關於強迫搬遷這些事，（註）他們倒很樂觀的——</p>
<p>“這官司打了幾年了，他們不敢奈何的。我們齊心，怕他？”</p>
<p>九龍城，這是一個原始的，質樸的，樂園般的鄉下啊！</p>
<p>（註）皇家的，—像這樣一句稱呼，在這鳥港上面是最有臉子的。有些高等華人不知是否有所謂“壓性”存在，對一切污穢的不道德的事物，總是鄙夷地說是“中國味”的。</p>
<p>（註）九龍城，如果我們近來也看報紙的話，相信這名字决不是陌生的。九龍半島的統治者正野心勃勃地想騙逐這附近一带的鄉民呢。</p>

<h3>逃伕</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>——山行雜什</p>
<p>半路逃伕子，那該是頂倒霉的事，在行幫，對於這，是有些忌諱的。</p>
<p>吃中飯的時候，不，不能這樣說，所謂“中飯”，實際上是老早的過了鐘點了，本來，在山路上，吃飯是不能遵照鐘點的，“趕尖落棧”，到處都可以喂肚子，只要你的肚子餓，謂儘量的開放了肚皮裝吧！盡路過所有的，能把你脹得要死，而代價却出乎意外的便宜。</p>
<p>該起身了，又是一陣忙亂，照規矩，那個人抬什麽東西，或是挑什麽東西，當初在派定以後，除去必要的事故以外，就很少有變更，誰同誰搭擋，那個與那個拚排，伕子們是不用每次分配的，於此，在將要動身的時候，他們就會用不到催促的尋找著拚擋的伙伴。然而今天，有點不平常，伙伴們肩着貨物一担一担地走过去，最後，剩下了四個担子抬不起來，找了一下，再從街頭喊到了那面的街口，又那裹有什麽踪影呢？</p>
<p>年青的张伙头喊啞了喉嚨，氣憤的走回來，眼裏冒上了一條條的血絲，額上的盤絡暴跳起來，嘴裹嚕囌着：“逃走四個，這羣龜兒子喲！”回頭一看，拚擋的四個伙伴仍舊呆呆地立在那裹。時間在走，當然不能長久的停在這裹，先走的一羣已經邁上了前面的山腰，迤邐着，像蟻在緩慢地爬。</p>
<p>無論由那方面說，老伕頭是不能再做這肩挑的重任了，張李兩個伕頭呢？不容忍默的負起了兩個伕子的缺額，還欠兩名呢，勢必要另外的去尋找了。</p>
<p>出了正直街，張伕頭還在嚕囌着：“好，龜兒子，害得老子要死，要呌我碰到，不把你打個臭爛！”走在畸嶇的路上，火氯還不能全消。同時，為了自己是担負着正面的前導，遇到山側裹有一坑水，或是路旁有一顆樹枝，也要像其他的伕子一樣，不停的喊着！</p>
<p>——前面一片洋喲——</p>
<p>——左手有青蓬𡂿！……</p>
<p>跟着，後面的伙件也就應答着——</p>
<p>——拉開鏡子好照相𡂿！</p>
<p>——抬桿過大峯喲！……</p>
<p>今天的雨意好像並沒有减輕，那“望山似跑馬”的看上去不遠的山峯，被鳥雲緊緊地壓蓋着，嶂氣和烏雲漸次的配合在一起，處在包圍中的山谷是更加幽暗了。澗流的水，這兩天也分外的急，平時，經過了幾度的冲擊濾練，澄清得能看得見澗底的游魚，而現在，則混黃得什麼都不能看見了，原因據說是為了前方的山洪暴發。</p>
<p>照行路的慣例，經過黃呀子的時候，本來還應該再打一回尖，啃那麼兩根才出鍋的玉黍，但天色的確太不好了，斜斜地細雨已經刷下來，落棧，趕路，這念頭吊在心上，撑起了油布，又趕上遥漠的途稈。前面，山峯上的雲壓，，更低了低了。</p>
<p>到了山頂的“茶亭”，雨大了，兜輿裹的褥子都濕了半節，計算一下，距離前面的棧頭，還有十里路的光景，看上去，天色將會阻碍了我們的行進了。商量以後，就决定暫時歇宿在茶亭。說起茶亭，實在不是歇宿的地方，统共只有做山產經營的六七间房子，左面的茶亭裹擺着一只很大的茶缸，三四雙缺了邊的杯子吊在茶缸的外邊，因為兩個尖站的距離比較遠了些，而且，這裹又是上山的孔道，“上山”，在熱天，總是容易口渴的，於此，茶亭就彌補了上項的需要。</p>
<p>同房主人再三的說合，才答應下來，每一間房子都賸了些空位給我們，坐在䓍棚下的長木櫈上，我們詢問着這裹的鄉情。突然的，房子裹揚起了一陣吼聲，那樣粗暴，嚴厲，還夾雜着拳打的回聲，我們驚住了，慌忙的趕了進去，呵！讓我們說什麽呢？兩名逃伕舒服的正躺在床上吸姻，被嚕囌了一路的張伕頭揪住了，不由分說的打上去，老伕頭在罵，許多人在喝吆。後來，調解的結果是他們兩名仍歸到伙裹，到縣城打“牙祭”的時候，由他們請伕頭喝幾兩黃湯作為酬勞，事情，就是這樣的解决了</p>
<p>夜晚，睡不着，靜聽着山裹水聲和雨打茅棚的清脆的音響。</p>
<h3>英國別開生面的化頑學校</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>英國东蘇爾頓鎮有一座十七世紀的古厦一位青年心理學家邵先生在裹面設了一個特殊學校，專對頑拗難教的兒童試行一種心理教育。全校只有學生二十餘人。最小者只有五歲，最大的十七歲。一半是父母教員都認為無法管教而送來的，因為這些兒童都是很激烈地反對尋常的規矩，還有一半，也經過各處心理教導所教導，無法矯正他們的惡習，才送到邵先生處教導，他們都患有各種神經病，內中幾個還患着偸物病。</p>
<p>邵先生命學生設立一個“警務法庭”，並由學生自定法律，自己執行。校裹職員的權威，不比學生更為大些，學生中的主席法官也能對職員起訴懲罰，職員不能對學生施用楚罰，不過遇到極重大的事件，也可以對學生施用威力。法庭開審案件，由證人述畢供詞後，卽由聽審的學生舉手决定被告是否有罪。法庭判决以後，被告若不遵行，可以再行起訴，可是第二次的懲罰，却要比第一次重些，並且還可以剝夺他的應享的權利。最大的懲罚，是不許他參加校裏一切社會生活。犯過的人，可令賠償損失，在他的零用錢裹扣除。若偸了多數金錢，審明以後，可把犯罪者的私人用品拍賣抵償，或罰他在校園裹工作，每小時照兩便士計算。曾有當地的一個農夫，到校訴說幾個兒童把他所養的羊追逐為嬉，於是學生和教職員的每週會議便通過了禁止嚇跑羊羣的法律。有一個小孩違犯了這法律，法庭曾罰他一便士。曾有一個學生，把將近一百條小魚放在一個玻璃瓶中，擠死了許多，經另一個學生報告了後，便通過一種法律，凡學生養魚或其他玩物，須領取執照，執照費是每張半便士。他們的一舉一動，都受團體的拘束。例如學生要乘脚踏車，须先在兩個學生面前考驗在馬路上駕駛，考騐合格，才發給乘脚踏车出外的執照。</p>
<p>邵先生起初准許學生在校如不願意上課，儘可不上課。他們可以隨意什麼時候起身，隨意什麼時候出外。但是經過邵先生化導以後，他們居然不願意享這種過分的自由，他們現在都能遵守新制度，順着常規發展。據邵先生說：這些學生將來都有成為良好公民的希望。</p>

<p>日來除林楚楚，胡戎，王桂林，許坤武，陳仁芝，爲『新人道』演戲，黎鏗廸弟黎錫亦已上鏡頭，乖巧伶俐正與當年無聲『人道』時之黎鏗同也。</p>
<h3>陳玉梅主演太平花</h3>
<p>名小説家張恨水的作品很多，「啼笑姻緣」和「歡喜寃家」已先後被搬上銀幕了。現在，他的名著「太平花」，又將由天一公司攝成影片了。</p>
<p>「太平花」名爲太平，實在不太平，正像名片「西線無戰事」的説是無戰事，實在大戰一般。所以「太平花」是反映着現時代的一部偉大的作品。</p>
<p>在天一的積極籌備中，「太平花」不久即將開拍，由陳玉梅領銜主演，由邵醉翁。文逸民，左明等聯合導演，這無疑是一部轟動影壇的鉅片了。</p>

<h3>The Shaanxi Situation May Be Revealed Within Days</h3>
<p>Kong Believes the Central Government Cherishes Broadmindedness; Yang Hucheng Expresses Acceptance of Measures; Mi Chunlin and Others Revisit Tongguan to Meet Gu</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The problem of post-Shaanxi and Gansu affairs gradually reveals a dawn of peace. Kong Xiangxi stated that the central government has always been broadminded in handling post-Shaanxi and Gansu affairs, guiding them with discipline and transforming them with virtue and righteousness. Director Gu Zhutong of Tongguan has been in close contact these days, acting in accordance with instructions. Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong have expressed their acceptance of the central government's post-disaster handling measures, and it is expected to be resolved. In the future, the army will be stationed in defense zones designated by the central government and will obey all central government orders and dispatch. Wang Shuchang, the Pacification Director of Gansu and Xinjiang, and Sun Weiru, the Chairman of Shaanxi and Xinjiang, are expected to take office soon. The central authorities are loyal to the country and can properly resolve this Shaanxi incident, which is a blessing for the country and the nation. (Special Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Shaanxi situation will be revealed within days. Mi Chunlin, Xie Ke, and others recently arrived at Tongguan again to visit Gu Zhutong. The negotiations are proceeding positively. Mi and others will come to Beijing in a day or two to report. (Special Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Yan telegraphed Yang a few days ago, advising him to take the country and the nation as a prerequisite, and to sincerely obey the central government. From the perspective of the Lu relationship, the Shaanxi incident is expected to be resolved peacefully. Han's representative, Liu Xizhong, plans to stay in Shanxi temporarily. This morning, he visited various military and political figures. Wan Fulin's representative visited Yan yesterday and returned to Baoding this morning to report back.閣政躬 has a health issue and has stopped working today, seeking medical treatment. (Special Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Ding Shaoji left Shanxi and returned to Beijing this morning. (Special Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Tongguan News: Amidst the severity of the Shaanxi situation, a relaxing atmosphere emerges. The troops of Zhang and Yang, along with the bandits, harbor mutual suspicion. Yang's inability to command Zhang's troops has long been an undeniable fact. Although Yang is red, he cannot merge with the red bandits like water and milk. Therefore, the bandit army is still in northern Wei and has not reached southern Wei. According to the current form of the Shaanxi situation, it is very beneficial to the central government's bandit suppression policy, which can be thoroughly completed. (Special Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] There are reports that Zhang's troops will issue orders to accept the situation, pushing He Zhuguo to negotiate with certain important officials. (Special Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] Bai Ruilin, a major general staff officer of the 15th Route Army Headquarters, left Luoyang for Tongguan on the evening of the 27th. (Central News Agency Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Arrives in Beijing to Contribute Opinions to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Dai Kui Sheng Visits Yu to Report; The Control Yuan Will Convene a Yuan Affairs Meeting</p>

<h3>Zhou Lisheng Talks About the Tranquility of Suiyuan</h3>

<p>[Nanjing] The Guangdong High Court requested an interpretation of whether a falsely accused person can request a review. The Judicial Yuan's interpretation is as follows: The crime of false accusation requires the intent to subject another person to criminal or disciplinary punishment as an essential element. In addition to infringing on the interests of the state, it also has the intent to infringe on personal interests. The falsely accused person can file a private prosecution. If he accuses the prosecutor and the prosecutor makes a decision not to prosecute, he can also request a review directive to comply with. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Qianjiang Bridge Overturning Tragedy</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Since the Qianjiang Bridge began construction, the project has been progressing quite actively. As the deadline approached, efforts were stepped up, digging mud and building piers were carried out late at night. The cold night, strong winds, and heavy dew made the work already extremely difficult. Unexpectedly, the overturning accident occurred due to carelessness during the night crossing. Of the hundred or so workers on the boat, only thirty were rescued, and the rest were swept away by the current. As of the most recent salvage, the confirmed number of drownings has reached seventy-eight. Some of the deceased workers' fate is still unknown. In total, more than 700 bridge workers died, accounting for one-tenth of the total. This cannot be said to be a shocking tragedy. After this incident occurred, those directly responsible should feel deeply pained. Even those in other places who usually care deeply cannot help but express their deep sympathy. Building the Qianjiang Bridge is not an easy task. The greatness of the project is widely recognized. Now, this unexpected misfortune has dampened the enthusiasm of the workers and affected the progress of the project. It is difficult for the general public to accept this. Before the aftermath is properly handled, I would like to offer a humble opinion.</p>
<p>All difficult and dangerous projects have their obstacles. The key is for those in charge to control them properly to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Regarding the Qianjiang Bridge project, there have been past incidents of damage, either due to the sudden outbreak of illness or due to the impact of disasters. Since these cannot be prevented by human effort, one can only accept fate. However, this matter is different from the past. The workers were crammed onto the boat, causing the helmsman to panic. The ferry boat was overloaded, causing it to capsize in the middle of the river. After the accident, there were no emergency measures or proper rescue efforts. Only a few of the hundred or so strong men were spared from becoming food for the fish. It is clear that the training was poor, the control was lax, the equipment was lacking, and the response was disorganized. The past responsibility is easy to discuss. Regarding future punitive measures, there should be a thorough rectification. Not only should there be proper equipment for late-night crossings, but other unexpected events must also be planned for. If human efforts are exhausted, then there will be no resentment in death. This is something that those in charge should repeatedly consider. The deceased workers should be given generous compensation to comfort the spirits of the dead and encourage the living. It is said that the contractor has agreed to pay 150 yuan per person and transport the coffins back to their hometowns. The Hangzhou General Labor Union also plans to request the provincial government and the Ministry of Railways to provide relief to the families of the deceased. This is a fair request, not an excessive demand. In order to urge the bridge project to move forward, the authorities should make a commitment as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, I have one more thing to say. Completing the bridge project on schedule is the most important thing today. The occurrence of this tragedy should not be used as an excuse for delay. Instead, efforts should be doubled to expedite the completion of the project. Based on the lessons learned from this incident, it is clear that the ferry is dangerous. The section of the Qianjiang River near the Liuhe Pagoda is originally narrower and shallower. However, due to overloading, this disaster still occurred. The Yi Ferry has a vast river surface and is filled with countless passengers. There must be situations where people are competing to be first. Just imagine how much more terrifying it would be. To eliminate future crises, the only way is to complete the bridge as soon as possible to allow direct passage. Moreover, the deceased worked hard day and night and looked forward to its completion. Now, this magnificent bridge is beginning to show its towering form, but those who participated in the construction have not been able to celebrate their success and have instead met with a fatal accident. The regret of failing after nine piles of earth is always on their mind in the underworld. If those who survive can take this as their responsibility and do their best, then the contribution to the project will greatly increase. The workers in the underworld can also rest in peace.</p>
<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Discusses Strengthening National Defense</h3>
<p>Demanding Unified Military Orders and Mechanization of the Army. The President Orders the Nationalization of Ammunition Manufacturing</p>
<p>[Paris] The French cabinet held a meeting today, at which President Lebrun personally signed seven orders stipulating that several aircraft manufacturing factories be converted into state-owned companies. This is in accordance with the French government's policy of nationalizing a portion of the ammunition manufacturing industry. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies discussed national defense issues this afternoon. Member of Parliament Reynaud gave a speech, stating that the army is not as strong as other countries in terms of numbers, and the government should make efforts to improve armaments to compensate for this. In addition, armaments factories should be established throughout the country to avoid the disadvantages of concentration in one place. He also said that when Germany marched into the Rhineland on March 7th last year, the French government sought the opinion of the military authorities. The answer was that if the French army wanted to take action, the mobilization time required in advance was extremely long, and the cost was extremely high. Based on this, France must have a strong mechanized force so that it can mobilize quickly when necessary. The general staff of the navy, army and air force should also be merged into one, and a grand marshal should be established to command the three services so that military orders can be unified in times of crisis. Regarding the air force, he said that the United Kingdom and France each have 1,300 new-style aircraft, while Germany has 2,000. Therefore, it is also necessary to build more aircraft and organize air defense. In addition, regarding the army, the armored division compiled by the Minister of National Defense Daladier during his tenure as Minister of the Army in 1932 has not been improved recently. Although France has new tanks, their number is far less than Germany. Therefore, the mechanization of the army is extremely urgent. Finally, he said that the government's procedure for reorganizing armaments can ask the working class to cooperate in order to see the results as soon as possible. Yaqinuo, a member of the Republican Democratic Union of the right wing, declared that France's border defenses are quite strong, and even if other countries launch a sudden attack, it will be difficult to succeed. However, the organization of the border defense forces should be flexible so that they can participate in offensive warfare instead of focusing on defensive work. The leader of the Republican Democratic Union, namely former cabinet member Maran, then spoke, advocating the speedy organization of passive defense work, and that all young people in the country should receive military training.

<h3>Resolution of Two International Disputes</h3>
<p>Language Issues in Alexandria and Antioch. Turkey and France Establish a Compromise</p>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting Ends Today. The Next Ordinary Meeting is Scheduled for May 24th</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Administrative Council is extremely pleased to have resolved two thorny disputes. The dispute between France and Turkey was resolved by agreeing to form a committee to draft a concrete code for the Sanjak. Various issues concerning Danzig have also reached a compromise. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The current session of the League of Nations Administrative Council will probably come to an end tomorrow. An informal meeting was held today, and it was decided that the next ordinary meeting of the Administrative Council, namely the 97th session, should originally be held on the first Monday of May (May 10th). However, because King George VI of the United Kingdom is scheduled to hold a coronation ceremony on the 12th of that month, it was postponed by two weeks to the 24th of that month. As for the meeting of the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference, it is scheduled to be held on May 6th. In addition, there are three items on the agenda for tomorrow's meeting of the Administrative Council.</p>
<p>㊀ Following the appointment of Lester, the High Commissioner of the League of Nations stationed in the Free City of Danzig, as the Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations, the successor has been internally determined to be Lieutenant General de Graff, the former Chief of Naval Staff of the Netherlands. It is expected to be formally appointed at tomorrow's meeting of the Administrative Council.</p>
<p>㊁ Regarding the issue of the Turkish minority in the cities of Alexandria and Antioch within Syria, a compromise has now been reached on the language issue that the two sides finally disputed. (According to the Turkish representative, the cities of Alexandria and Antioch should only use Turkish as the official language, which France considered inconvenient to follow.) Therefore, the two sides have reached a complete agreement, and the agreement will be filed at tomorrow's meeting of the Administrative Council.</p>
<p>㊂ Regarding the evacuation of refugees accommodated in the embassies of various countries in Madrid, Spain, a method will be decided at tomorrow's meeting of the Administrative Council.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the issue of re-distribution of raw materials, the Administrative Council has appointed representatives from 14 countries to organize a special committee to study it. Because the International Labor Bureau previously raised this issue for discussion at a meeting in 1919, French Foreign Minister Tarbos advocated that the Bureau also send a representative to participate in this committee in order to achieve better results. The Administrative Council approved it. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Anniversary of the Nazi Party's Rule in Germany</h3>
<p>Hitler to Issue Declaration</p>
<p>[Berlin] Germany will hold a celebration this Saturday to mark the fourth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. On that day, the agenda of the Reichstag includes passing laws to continue Hitler's rule, because the Reichstag granted this power to Hitler for a period of four years in March 1933. It is heard that the election of the new speaker of the Reichstag is also on the agenda. After the completion of the above matters, Hitler will deliver a speech on domestic and foreign affairs. Hitler's speech is quite long, and it will take about two hours. He will respond to British Foreign Secretary Eden's recent call for Germany to cooperate in seeking peace.

<h3>Continued Trial of the Soviet Russian Counter-Revolutionary Case Reveals Conspiracies of Germany and Japan</h3>
<p>German Engineer Testifies to Inside Story - Japan Subsidized Huge Sums - Hollywood Actors Also Involved</p>
<p>[Moscow] The trial of seventeen former high-ranking Soviet officials accused of counter-revolutionary activities continued today. A German engineer named Stamm, employed at the Gusbass coal mine, testified in court with shocking revelations. He claimed that many German engineers working in the Soviet Union had tried to recruit him into a conspiracy of sabotage and espionage, telling him, "You are here working for Germany, not helping the Bolsheviks," to stir his patriotic feelings. When he refused, they called him a coward and a traitor. Eventually, an official representative of Germany in Novosibirsk came to persuade him to engage in anti-Soviet activities, promising assistance if he were exposed. Stamm's testimony also mentioned the German engineer Stickling, who was convicted last November for allegedly plotting sabotage in Siberian mining areas. Therefore, it is generally believed that the prosecutor intends to implicate the 35 German nationals arrested since last November in this case. At the opening of today's trial, Judge Ulrich clashed with the prosecutor because he did not allow the defendant Stroilov to testify about his relationship with the German military attaché in Novosibirsk. After a formal protest by Prosecutor Vyshinsky, the judge allowed Stroilov to continue his testimony, but warned him not to reveal the names and nationalities of foreign representatives. It is said that the German consular officer instructed Stroilov to engage in sabotage in the coal industry to prevent Soviet coal production from competing with Germany. Furthermore, defendants Livshitz, former head of the Soviet Railway Bureau, and Kenazhev testified that they had received 35,000 rubles and other items from Japanese secret agents as rewards for sabotaging railways and assassinating Stalin, Ukrainian important official Postyshev, and his Communist Party Central Committee member Sivers. Their testimony was followed by a detailed account of his life's misadventures by the defendant Aniol, which lasted for three hours, somewhat easing the tense atmosphere in the courtroom. According to Aniol himself, he had become a U.S. citizen, worked as a film actor in Hollywood, and finally joined various dangerous undertakings. He had narrowly escaped death several times while abroad before returning to Russia and joining the Trotskyist party. Aniol further confessed that in 1933, when the Chairman of the Soviet Council of People's Commissars, Molotov, inspected the Ural mines, he served as his driver and admitted that he had intended to drive the car off a cliff to kill Molotov, but at the last minute, he suddenly felt a nervous breakdown and did not carry out the plan. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Another shocking incident occurred today. The former director of the South Ural Railway Bureau, Kryazhev, confessed that there were over 1,500 train wreck conspiracies in 1934 and approximately 2,000 in 1935. According to his confession, he should be held fully responsible for the train accident that killed 65 people and injured 164. Kryazhev continued that he had been forced to hand over the army mobilization plan to a Japanese secret agent, who insisted that troop transport trains should be filled with the most virulent bacteria in the event of war and that trains carrying food supplies should be set on fire.

<h3>Person Who Ordered the Tsar's Execution During the Russian Revolution</h3>

<h3>Japanese Military Refuses to Cooperate, Ugaki Cabinet Fails to Form</h3>
<p>Consultations with Senior Officials in the Imperial Court Yesterday Morning - Decision to Make Further Efforts to Overcome Difficulties</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Although there has been no significant progress in Ugaki's cabinet formation, he is still making a final effort. As of late last night, Ugaki had not indicated that he would abandon the task of forming a cabinet, suggesting that he still has other plans. However, general observation believes that it is very difficult to easily overcome the current difficulties. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Ugaki's cabinet formation has entered its most difficult stage. This morning, Ugaki entered the Imperial Palace to meet with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa Kurahei to request that he report to the Emperor the greatest difficulties encountered in forming a new cabinet. The current situation has reached a point where Ugaki has no hope of obtaining a Minister of the Army unless extraordinary measures are taken. However, not only can such measures not be implemented at this time, but even if they were, they would only make the political turmoil more serious and make it more difficult to deal with the future situation. Furthermore, the cabinet formed by such a posture would also be unsustainable. Therefore, general observation last night and this morning believes that Ugaki has no other way to go but to abandon the task of forming a cabinet. This morning, Japanese newspapers unanimously expressed regret over the impending failure of Ugaki's cabinet formation. This situation makes our perspective on the current trend and future of Japanese politics even more profound. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] General Ugaki, on the third day of cabinet formation, met with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa on the morning of the 27th and is still making a final effort to form a cabinet. However, the current objective situation is still on the verge of failure, and the situation is extremely worrying. General observation from various aspects is roughly like this: It seems impossible for General Ugaki to ease the strong attitude of the army in the current situation using ordinary methods and means. Even if he exerts all his strength, it is doubtful whether he can open up the situation. The meeting with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa may reveal any solution. (Domei News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The difficult process of General Ugaki's cabinet formation and the details of his meeting with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa are as follows, according to General Ugaki's close associates. Today, General Ugaki met with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa to report on the progress of cabinet formation. The cabinet formation headquarters has not given up its hope. The so-called resigning the imperial mandate or other so-called extraordinary measures are not being considered. There are considerable strong recommendations for the successor to the Minister of the Army, so it should not be completely impossible for someone to take office. (Domei News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Senior officials in the Imperial Court stayed up late in the Imperial Palace last night, watching the progress of General Ugaki's cabinet formation, and talked with Prince Saionji for a long time by long-distance telephone. (Domei News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The army authorities refused to recommend candidates for Minister of the Army to General Ugaki. However, General Ugaki issued a statement that he would continue to form a cabinet according to the established policy. The world believes that Ugaki must have a secret plan to achieve his cabinet formation goal. The so-called secret plan is: ❶ Although former Minister of the Army Terauchi stated that there were no candidates for Minister of the Army other than the few recommended on the 26th, General Ugaki is familiar with the internal affairs of the army, or after conducting personal negotiations with the people he deems appropriate, he will request former Minister of the Army Terauchi to convene a meeting of the three chiefs to decide to recommend that person as a candidate for Minister of the Army. ❷ Request the Emperor to issue an imperial edict to the three chiefs of the army to select candidates for Minister of the Army. However, General Ugaki, in view of the seriousness of the situation, is unwilling to take the second method. Therefore, Ugaki seems to be adopting the first method and exerting his final efforts. However, the army's opposition attitude is unlikely to be eased, and Ugaki's cabinet will inevitably fail. (Domei News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Imai's Statement</h3>
<p>Still Upholding the Spirit of Careful Agreement - Proceeding with Organizational Work</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding General Ugaki's cabinet formation, Chief of Staff Imai Tadashigeru issued the following statement at the cabinet formation headquarters at 4:20 pm today: General Ugaki entered the Imperial Palace today and said that he was asking for a few days of delay. The so-called few days can be interpreted as two or three days, or five or six days, but it should not be taken as conclusive. He will definitely try to find a quick solution as much as possible, and he must not prolong the situation into a protracted war. The 28th should be the final period. This statement also cannot be clearly stated by me. As for the so-called quietly awaiting any imperial edict from the Imperial Court, this has not been considered. The delay in cabinet formation has caused misunderstandings and anxiety, which is extremely worrying. If our actions increase the country's concerns, we should absolutely avoid them. General Ugaki will probably take any action, but the results of his handling must be carefully considered. What General Ugaki is considering has nothing to do with the impact of today's meeting with the Minister of the Imperial Household. In short, how the situation is, I do not want to use the words "improve" or "reverse." Roughly speaking, our actions are based on what we think, which depends on what the internal situation is. It is not convenient to say how it is currently proceeding. (Domei News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Imai Tadashigeru further said to others at 10:00 pm: Tonight, I originally intended to promote the cabinet formation, but I still have not come up with a plan and will wait until tomorrow. This place will thoroughly consider everything in accordance with the purpose of a satisfactory solution and will never use any legal means for the sake of obtaining a Minister of the Army. It is not possible to predict whether there will be a meeting with the army cadres on the 28th. However, this place will try to find a solution in a spirit of coordination. Any resolution or intention that violates this spirit has not been considered. The navy has not yet replied because the time to urge them has not yet arrived. In addition, there is no pre-determined priority for the army over the navy. In short, we will do our best to coordinate and solve the problem in a satisfactory manner and will never use any exceptional methods. The Minister of the Army issue must also be agreed upon by the three chiefs and should be achieved through a coordinated attitude. Before the goal is achieved, it is not yet anticipated whether to continue this state at any time or to ask for further delay. It is not known until tomorrow whether General Ugaki will meet with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa or pay a visit on the 28th, because there is currently no so-called planned action. As for conducting cabinet entry negotiations by telegram, there is no such thing. (Domei News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Army Statement</h3>
<p>Implementing Political Reform - No Attempt at Dictatorship</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Ugaki's cabinet encountered a fate of failure because the army's Three Chiefs Conference on the 26th announced that it would refuse to recommend candidates for Minister of the Army. The army believes that General Ugaki has no choice but to abandon the task of forming a cabinet and has no other way but to resign the imperial mandate. They also interpret the statement issued by Ugaki on the evening of the 26th as expressing his intention to resign the imperial mandate. The reason why the army refused the cabinet was not due to issues such as political platforms and policies, but because it considered General Ugaki an inappropriate person from the perspective of achieving the goal of military purification. The actual reason lies in Ugaki's personal affairs, so the army's refusal reason is absolute and there is no room for compromise. (Domei News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Since the imperial mandate to form a cabinet was given to General Ugaki, various rumors have spread, claiming that the army's attitude is to prevent those who attempt to seize power and seek dictatorship, and others claiming that they will seek radical changes in the financial world. The army denies this under the following views and asserts that these rumors are deliberately slandering the army:</p>
<p>❶ Preventing Usurpation of Power: Considering the current relationship between the army and General Ugaki, the army is preventing the initiation of usurpation of power. However, when Commander of the Military Police Nakajima first met General Ugaki in a private capacity on his way to Kyoto and when General Ugaki visited General Terauchi, they did not advise him to resign. Also, the army did not obstruct his cabinet formation with the army's general intention or collective pressure. They only explained the internal situation in detail and stated that no one was willing to succeed as Minister of the Army. Finally, when General Terauchi visited General Ugaki, he reported that the Three Chiefs had formally agreed to select candidates for Minister of the Army and the results of coordinating with various candidates. Therefore, accusations of obstructing the usurpation of power and interfering with cabinet formation are absolutely inappropriate.</p>
<p>❷ Dictatorial Politics: The army's unwavering fundamental policy regarding political methods was stated in the statement on the 23rd, which is to always adhere to the unique constitution of the empire and carry out legitimate constitutional politics. Under the current circumstances, the only way to base is on this is to expect the development of a clear, proactive, and strong reformist politics. There is absolutely no attempt at dictatorship.</p>
<p>❸ Transformation of the Financial World: The claim that the military has the intention to carry out radical reforms of the economy, which will inevitably cause chaos in the financial world, is propaganda. The army's attitude towards economic problems is based on avoiding chaos and seeking to cope with the situation legally and gradually, in view of the current pressing situation. This is no different from the past. (Domei News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Navy Authorities Temporarily Do Not Express Attitude</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] General Ugaki met with Navy Minister Nagano on the afternoon of the 25th to request the navy authorities' understanding regarding the cabinet formation issue. The Navy Minister did not reply immediately. Navy Minister Nagano must consult with Prince Fushimi, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, who is currently taking refuge from the cold in Atami, and there are other various reasons. His reply to General Ugaki seems unavoidable to be delayed. (Domei News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Youth Party Gives Advice to Terauchi</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Greater Japan Youth Party organized by Colonel Hashimoto Kingoro submitted the following petition to Minister of the Army Terauchi today:</p>
<p>If you try to perfunctorily deal with the current political situation and misjudge the future of the empire, it will definitely not be allowed. If you release an arrow and miss the target of reform, you will have to pay for it even in death. We express our full support for the historical mission of the army authorities to thoroughly promote reforms in the central leadership with an unwavering determination and fervent devotion. We still hope to implement our original intentions in order to move forward. This is what we earnestly hope for. (Domei News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Financial World Hopes</h3>
<p>For the Emergence of a Powerful Cabinet - Early Stabilization of the Political Situation</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Because the army refused to recommend a successor to the Minister of the Army, Ugaki's cabinet is in danger of failing under the current objective circumstances. However, as the political situation becomes more urgent, what the financial world is most concerned about is the attitude of the army, which is a realistic force capable of influencing the political situation. Its political goals and the substance of its reformist trends are enough to determine the base tone of the financial world from now on, causing all nerves to concentrate sharply. It is believed that the new cabinet's policies will be more radical than ever before, so the so-called wartime system will be further promoted in both the political and economic fields, which the financial world is proud of. Therefore, we hope that a powerful cabinet that is expected by the public will quickly deal with the political situation, stabilize the situation, and clarify the direction of its political and economic movements.

<h3>Uninvited Guests Break into Ugaki's Private Residence</h3>
<p>Demanding Retreat in the Face of Difficulty - Hat Was Damaged</p>
<p>[Nanjing] General Ugaki entered the Imperial Palace this morning to meet with Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa to discuss solutions to open up the difficulties in forming a cabinet. After returning to his private residence, three uninvited guests followed him into the room, intending to harm Ugaki. However, they were stopped by Ugaki's guards, unable to succeed. Ugaki was fortunately unharmed, but his silk hat was damaged. The three men have now been arrested and are members of the Farmers' and Workers' Alliance. They were not carrying weapons, only holding a petition demanding that Ugaki retreat in the face of difficulty and had no intention of causing harm. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Important Speech by Chairman Yuki of the Japan National Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Preventing the Impact of a Large Budget - Promoting Sino-Japanese Friendship - Supporting American Economic Policy</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry held a meeting of representatives of the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry at the Industry Club on the 26th. Chairman Yūki Toyotarō gave a speech on the current situation, the content of which is quite noteworthy. Yūki briefly stated that the government has prepared a huge budget for this year and is trying to implement tax system reforms to deal with the serious international situation. This is indeed an unavoidable situation, but its impact on the financial and industrial worlds is extremely large. When the government implements this budget, we must make all-round plans to prevent its impact. The significant issues arising from budget increases, tax increase plans, etc., are rising prices. Rising prices are a global phenomenon. However, it is quite clear that unnatural price increases in Japan will not only have a negative impact on the financial, industrial, and trade worlds, but also pose a significant obstacle to the implementation of the budget. As for Sino-Japanese relations, China and Japan should always maintain friendly relations. However, I regret that recently, they have turned against each other at every turn. I said at the New Year's banquet to experts and the public in neighboring China, advocating the necessity of economic friendship between the two countries. Looking at the recent international trade situation, nationalistic economic concepts dominate the general situation, creating an unpleasant atmosphere between countries. I believe that opening up this dead end in the international economy and clarifying trade relations can ease the tension and will definitely contribute to world peace. Therefore, the urgent task now is to try to restore the international economy. In this sense, I express my greatest respect for the remarks of U.S. Secretary of State Hull. When we advocate economic friendship, we should conduct negotiations in a spirit of mutual concession to resolve trade issues, Chinese issues, etc. (Domei News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Yūki, the chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who strongly advocated promoting Sino-Japanese friendly relations, advocated Anglo-Japanese economic reconciliation at a reception for parliamentarians on the night of the 26th, attracting attention. Previously, various circles in the financial world had plans to send goodwill missions to various countries, or intended to send economic reply missions to the British economic envoy Sir Henry Page Croft, the American economic envoy Frank Orren Lowden, and the Chinese economic envoy Wu Dingchang. However, due to changes in the situation, they were forced to suspend and were unable to realize it. However, various circles in the financial world, as in Chairman Yūki's speech, are very enthusiastic about the hope of economic cooperation with the above-mentioned countries. Therefore, after the current political situation stabilizes, the plan to dispatch economic goodwill reply missions is bound to be brought up again. In particular, the Japan Economic Federation believes that the International Chamber of Commerce Congress in Berlin in June is an excellent opportunity to send reply missions to the UK and the US.

<h3>Serious Flooding in the United States - Government Actively Provides Relief</h3>
<p>Victims Numbered 750,000 - House of Representatives Passes Huge Disaster Relief Bill</p>
<p>[New York] It is learned that the number of deaths due to flooding has reached 345, but the death toll is likely to increase after reports are received from many isolated people. To date, the total number of displaced persons has reached 750,000, and property losses are increasing daily, currently estimated at $350 million. The plague in Louisville is the worst of all the major cities, with 200 men, women, and children dying of exhaustion, and there is also a raging fire. Local police are now demolishing tall buildings to stop the spread. Red Cross officials are now working hard to provide relief, saying this is the most urgent event the organization has faced since the European War. Fifty planes carrying multiple doctors and medicines and food have flown to Louisville. It is generally believed that the worst period of the Ohio River basin has passed, but large groups of people are still working day and night to pile up planks and sandbags to secure the 300-mile-long dikes on both banks of the Mississippi River. They are trying to build a high wall to stop the torrents that are now pouring from the Ohio River into the Mississippi. It is reported that approximately 2 million acres of farmland in the Mississippi River basin have been flooded. At the same time, the Midwest is still suffering from drought, and the hope for rain is like the hope for floodwaters to recede in the flood zone. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The lack of drinking water and the rudimentary sanitary facilities in the flood areas have caused great concern about the outbreak of serious infectious diseases. The number of deaths from the flood has now reached 132, and the losses have reached $300 million. This flood is feared to be the largest in American history. Volunteers are now busy piling up sandbags to dam the water in southeastern Missouri, indicating that the Mississippi River will also overflow. The Mississippi River is the eastern boundary of Missouri, 500 miles long. After the great flood of 1927, flood control structures worth $1 billion were built in the lower reaches of the river, and it will now be tested whether they are effective. Washington, Boston, and Philadelphia are sending planes loaded with serum to various disaster areas. At the same time, the Ohio River in Cincinnati, Ohio, is currently rising rapidly, and 200,000 more people may flee to shelters. The House of Representatives today passed a $790 billion disaster relief bill to provide government funds to help the refugees. (Reuter, 26th)</p>

<h3>Various Circles in Guangdong Province Actively Relieve the Current Rice Shortage</h3>
<p>Imported Rice Allowed Entry with Half Tax, Still No Benefit; First Batch of Wuhu Rice to Guangdong Begins to Sell at Reduced Prices</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong's grain supply has recently been short, and prices remain high. In recent days, officials, businessmen, and various circles have recognized rice prices as a serious social problem in Guangdong. If rice prices do not fall, people's livelihoods cannot be solved. In this difficult time of the year, ordinary people are already suffering economic hardship. If rice is as expensive as pearls, all businesses will become more desolate, and it is feared that this will lead to public security problems. Recently, bandits in the countryside have resorted to crime due to lack of food and clothing. Gangs in waterways and bandits in the green forests are taking the opportunity to be active, robbing homes, which is often heard. Robbing ships and looting vehicles are also common. However, to relieve the current rice shortage, the highest military and civilian authorities in Guangdong Province have repeatedly appealed to the central government to exempt taxes on foreign rice to allow temporary imports to regulate the market. However, after repeated appeals, the Ministry of Finance finally approved a half tax exemption on foreign rice, with the remaining half to be borne by the provincial government through bookkeeping. Although this measure shows the central government's deep concern for the food of the people of Guangdong Province, the cost of imported foreign rice with half tax exemption, including taxes, freight, and other expenses, does not appear to be low. Merchants are unwilling to purchase it because it is not cost-effective, and it seems that it will still not help to solve the current rice shortage. Therefore, all circles in the province held a meeting on the 23rd of this month to relieve the rice shortage and decided to promote the Provincial and Municipal Party Departments, the Provincial and Municipal Chambers of Commerce, the Rice Industry Association, the Miscellaneous Grain Association, the Banking Association, the Silver Industry Association, the Machinery Industry Association, the Shipping Industry Association, the Civil Ship Association, the Provincial and Municipal Education Associations, and other 19 organizations to jointly organize the Guangdong People's Food Relief Association. They will raise funds to purchase rice and sell it at reduced prices. At the same time, they will send another telegram to the central government to exempt taxes on foreign rice, order the four provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei to transport rice to Guangdong for sale, abolish export rice taxes, and order the China Merchants Bureau and the Yuehan Railway Bureau to allocate additional ships and vehicles to transport domestic rice to Guangdong for assistance. At the same time, the provincial government ordered the People's Food Regulation Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Provincial Capital Police Bureau, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to investigate the current amount of grain and rice stored, calculate the daily food needs of the people, and prohibit grain merchants from manipulating rice prices. The association has previously signed an agreement with provincial and municipal banks, under which the banking group will provide a loan of 4 million yuan to purchase grain from neighboring provinces and transport it to Guangdong. Of the 4 million yuan loan, more than ten banks will recognize the amount and raise 4 million yuan, which is called the banking group's grain collateral. The agreement stipulates that the weekly interest rate is 6%, and the interest is entirely borne by the People's Food Regulation Association. After this, for each purchase of rice, the banking group will provide 80% of the funds, and the People's Food Regulation Association will bear 20%. For example, for the purchase of 1 million yuan of rice, the banking group will bear 800,000 yuan, and the People's Food Regulation Association will bear 200,000 yuan. The profits and losses of future business operations will also be borne by the People's Food Regulation Association, and the Finance Department is designated as the loan guarantee agency for the People's Food Association. It is reported that the second batch of 32,000 bags of Wuhu rice purchased by the People's Food Association has already been transported to the provincial capital. The city of Guangzhou is divided into twelve districts, and each district is assigned a rice store to sell this Wuhu rice at a fixed price. It is expected that this Wuhu rice will be completely sold out within ten days. The general public still hopes that the People's Food Association will continuously purchase and transport assistance.

<h3>New Mine in Xiamen Confirmed as Hard Manganese</h3>
<p>Reserves of 400,000 to 500,000 Tons, Excellent Ore Quality; Private Prospecting Only Close to Ore Vein, No Illegal Mining Yet</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: A person named Lu Zancheng in Heshan Huguo Village (also known as Zhukeng Lake), Saizai Mountain, outside Xiamen City, formed the "Jianxingyuan Mining Cooperative," appointed himself as manager, signed a contract with Yang Binfu, a representative of the Huguo villagers, and privately started prospecting. He has dug a mining pit seven zhang deep. The Heshu Special Zone Office discovered this, detained Lu Yang and related persons for strict interrogation, and investigated whether there was any background. After this case occurred, the Special Zone Office immediately reported it to the Provincial Government. Construction Commissioner Lin sent mining technician Chen Nie to Xiamen by car on the evening of the 24th. On the 25th, he accompanied Liu Jitang from the Special Zone Office to the mining area for inspection. According to Chen's announcement, the ore quality is confirmed to be hard manganese. The ore bed spreads around about 600 meters, with reserves of about 400,000 to 500,000 tons. However, the depth of the ore bed has not been explored, so it cannot be determined. The ore quality is quite good, with a manganese content of over 80%. Manganese ore is divided into three types: soft manganese, hard manganese, and rhodochrosite. Hard manganese can be used for steelmaking. Currently, the best quality can be sold for 80 to 90 yuan per ton, and the lower quality can be sold for 40 to 50 yuan. Because the reserves of this mine are not large, a small-scale capital of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan can be used for mining. However, its advantage is that it is located in Xiamen and has convenient transportation. The private prospecting mine has also been inspected. Only stones have been dug out, just close to the ore vein. Although there is manganese quality, the content is very thin and has not yet reached the ore layer, so it cannot be said that it has been illegally mined. I have taken samples back to the province for reporting and testing." Chen also said, "The Anxi iron mine is inconvenient for transportation, and the equipment requires too much expense. The Construction Department only spent 80,000 to 90,000 yuan on exploration last year. If mining is carried out, it will require a capital of more than 10 million yuan, which cannot be handled by the current financial and economic situation of Fujian Province, so we can only wait for the future."

<h3>Anhui Province Treasury System Completed</h3>
<p>Land Tax from All 62 Counties in the Province Will Be Collected by Local Banks on Behalf</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui Local Bank was originally a central organization for the provincial government to promote economic construction and activate local finance. Therefore, at the beginning of its establishment, it first focused on the establishment of a foundation and the investigation of the rural economy. In the past year, it has set up branches in Anqing, Bengbu, and Tunxi, and offices in 34 counties. In terms of organization, it has completed the initial plan. In order to strictly construct the economic structure and accelerate the promotion of business, it was decided to add offices in the remaining 26 counties and organize them all before the end of May. At that time, the bank's financial network will have spread to all 62 counties in the province, and the treasury system will be fully completed. Recently, it has decided to develop several plans and actively implement them: ㊀ The construction of new houses for branches and offices in various places will be subsidized by the province, and the rest will be raised by themselves. The bank has decided to raise 100,000 yuan first and start construction in ten counties including Dangtu, He County, and Wuwei. After completion, construction will be carried out in other counties in turn. This housing project will pay special attention to the equipment of the treasury. ㊁ In the future, all provincial and county warehouses in the province must be assigned to the bank for management. ㊂ In addition to the treasury custody library and other items, the business part of the county offices must add a land tax collection office to be in charge of land tax matters. The provincial authorities plan to successfully handle the land report of the entire province in the short term, and change the land tax to be collected by the bank on its behalf, so that the county government can devote itself to the promotion of administrative aspects. This reform of the land tax method will also make the people feel great convenience.</p>
<p>Land Report in Southern Anhui Scheduled to be Handled in March</p>
<p>In order to complete the land report, the Provincial Government decided to handle 21 counties in Wuhu and Xuancheng in southern Anhui this year, and has appointed Du Shihua, a technician from the Construction Department, to be in charge of guidance. In Wuhu, the Finance Department organized a survey team to handle it directly. It is heard that the captain of the survey team has been appointed Luo Chuke, and will start at the same time in March this year. However, in Yitai, Tiancheng, Xingchun Waitan, Xintang, Baoda, Donghu Tan, Minsheng, Ouyang, and Wuzhang of Wu, Ding Jianjun, director of the Wufan Reclamation Bureau and supervisor of the upgrading of the two counties of Sufan, will jointly handle it with the county government. A survey team will be organized and dispatched to work. In order to save expenses, Ding himself will serve as the captain of the team. Regarding the compilation and investigation personnel, the Provincial Land Bureau will transfer 150 people from Fuyang and other Qingzhang personnel to Yanhu or Anqing for training. In the future, the survey will be done entirely by triangulation, and it will be completed in four months. The compilation and investigation will also be completed in four months. Together with the procedures for upgrading, the entire process will be completed in ten months.</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties in Reorganizing Land Tax, Profit Sharing to Subsidize Localities</p>
<p>After the abolition of harsh taxes and miscellaneous fees, the local financial resources of Anhui Finance Department were short. The only way out to open up new sources of income is to reorganize the land tax. The province also only hopes that the land tax can be reorganized, and the provincial and county accounting policies can be coordinated to make it abundant. Therefore, it does not hesitate to allocate the provincial treasury's regular income to supplement the county's local finances. In the 24th year, it formulated the method of reorganizing the land tax, sharing profits, and subsidizing the county's local finances, and submitted it to the provincial government for review and approval. Since its implementation, it has achieved remarkable results, especially the bad habits of following the example of disasters in the past have been completely eliminated. The actual exemption has benefited the disaster victims. The number of annual levies has increased from more than 3.7 million yuan to more than 4.8 million yuan. As of the end of June of the 25th year, the counties that reported profits from the land tax in the 24th year included He County, Huaining, Su County, Hao County, Yingshang, Lingbi, Si County, Chuzhou, and Shucheng, except for Dangtu County. Those who continue to report have not yet been counted. This is the general situation of the reorganization of land tax after the promulgation of the profit sharing method in the 24th year of this province. Since the example of disasters has been eliminated, the reorganization of land tax should focus on investigating wasteland and eliminating abuses. The counties should be urged to handle it seriously. The 25th year's method of reorganizing land tax, sharing profits, and subsidizing the county's local finances will be continued, and the paths that each county should follow for reorganizing land tax and the standard amount of tax revenue increase will be specified in the attached table. Now, a copy of the method and the attached table are specially attached, and the provincial government chairman is requested to review and approve them. They have been submitted to the Standing Committee for deliberation and resolution as planned. (January 26)</p>
<h3>Robbery in Songjiang's Busy City Immediately Solved</h3>
<p>The home of Yang Zhenqing, a resident of Five Households, Six Jia, Seven Bao, Guyang Town, Kuojie, outside the West Gate of this city, was preparing lunch at about 10:00 am today (27th). Suddenly, four thugs speaking with a Hakka accent came, holding pistols, shouting to forbid any noise, and brazenly robbed the gold necklace worn around the neck of the master's mother. Just as they were about to split up to search, the master's wife heard the alarm in the back and went to the Detai Clothing Store (that is, West Gate Avenue) across the river to report the robbery. The store immediately reported it to the police station by telephone and dispatched a team. Unexpectedly, the robbers heard the telephone report across the river and did not stay any longer. They took the stolen goods and fled west and south along the railway line. The 12th Security Brigade and the Detective Team received the report successively and split up to pursue them. Captain Yang personally led the detectives to chase south. At Huangyongtan, Mizidu, Liuqi Township, they forced and captured two robbers. One robber said. They then brought the three robbers back, named Xu Ronglin, 55 years old, from Fenghua, Zhu Kehong, from Wenzhou, and Zhang Asan, 34 years old, from Taizhou. All the stolen goods and weapons were taken away by the escaped robber. This is the first robbery case in the city this year.</p>

<h3>Kunshan Opium Smoker Commits Suicide by Drowning Out of Fear of Punishment</h3>
<p>Qian Huichun, a farmer from Seven Households, Three Jia, Two Bao, Xigu Township, Third District of the county, smoked opium. Because his family was poor and unable to obtain a license, the police went to the countryside to search for opium smokers on the 25th. Qian, fearing arrest for private smoking, committed suicide by drowning that night. After being discovered and rescued, he had already died. His son, A Gen, is blind and his situation is very pitiful.</p>
<h3>Nantong's Coastal Defense Along the Yangtze River Blocks Fleeing Bandits</h3>
<p>The District Security Command in the Tong area along the Yangtze River and the sea has ordered the police and water patrols in each county to strictly guard against the intrusion of fleeing bandits, since the bandits in Xinyangkou have been defeated by the major teams of the Provincial Maritime Public Security Third District.

<p>Investigate and Prohibit the Encirclement of Yicheng Beach</p>
<p>The Yicheng Beach in Changyinsha was reported by the Education Bureau for the purpose of funding educational expenses.

<h3>Robbery Occurs in Boai Township, Jiangyin</h3>
<p>At about 12:00 pm the night before last (25th), more than ten bandits broke into the home of Sun Xuezhai in Boai Township, Third District, and brazenly robbed them, losing about 500 to 600 yuan worth of clothing and other items in legal tender, and left with a roar. On the morning of the 26th, the militia team arrested three suspects, including Wang Peiguan and the wife of Ding Fengguan, and sent them to the team headquarters for interrogation before sending them to the county for trial.</p>
<h3>New Site of Changshu Library Determined</h3>
<p>The problems of the relocation of the county government and the library, which were involved in the establishment of the county court here, have now been resolved. The county court has determined the county government's house as the court site, and the county government will move to the library. The only thing that is vacant is the new site of the library. Initially, the authorities advocated moving the library's books to the private residence of the Zhang family, but this was opposed by a majority of people. Because the library has tens of thousands of books, all of which are rare copies, once they are placed in a private residence, it is inevitable that they will be lost. Therefore, they telegraphed the provincial government and other places to stop it. Later, an order came to the county from the higher authorities, saying that it should be handled carefully. Now, the county has allocated 20,000 yuan specifically for the construction of the library. At the same time, a committee for the construction of the library was organized. After surveying the Zhishan Party in Liang Zhaoming's reading center in Shimei, it was decided to use it as the library site. It has been decided at the meeting that construction will start next month. However, before the new library is built, all the books will be properly sealed and temporarily stored in the Zhang family's house.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan Implements Tea Industry Cooperation</h3>
<p>The Pingshui Mashe Shanlou Circle green tea in Shaoshan and Xiaoshan has always occupied an important position in the international market.

According to Tang Xunze, director of cooperation from the Construction Department, the cooperative business is already actively in progress. Recently, it was decided to extend it to the tea industry. It is planned to convene tea farm directors, tea merchants, and tea farmer representatives by the middle of next month to discuss the organization of the Pingshui Tea Industry Production and Sales Cooperative. This plan has been largely drafted. It is reported that the cooperative will be formally established when the tea season starts this year.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chinese Football Team to Depart for Hong Kong on the Ninth of Next Month</h3>
<p>Departing on the Queen of Asia; Team Practices in Shen Garden This Morning</p>
<p>The Chinese football team is scheduled to gather for practice at Shen Garden at 7:00 am this morning. However, whether Li Ning, Wan Xianghua, and Chen Zhenhe will be able to attend the trial match against the Interport Ideal Team this Saturday is of great concern to the general public. It is reported that Li and Wan have fully recovered from their injuries and will officially attend this Saturday's trial match, and will also attend this morning's practice match. Since Chen Zhenhe returned to Shanghai last week, he has decided not to go elsewhere for the time being, so that he can represent the Chinese team in Hong Kong to attend the Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese Interport Games, which will be restored this year. Xu Yahui's representation of the Chinese team is no longer a problem since he retired from the Aviation School. However, it is feared that he will not attend this Saturday's trial match against the Ideal Team. Whether or not this is certain is still difficult to judge. After the Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese Interport Football Championship was scheduled by the Hong Kong side to be held on the 14th, 17th, and 22nd of next month, the Shanghai team has decided to depart on the Queen of Asia on the 9th of next month to participate in the grand event. The following players must attend the Chinese team's practice match this morning on time. The list is as follows: Zhang Rongcai, Li Ning, Xu Yahui, Xu Jingcheng, Li Yichen, Zhuang Youren, Gu Shangxun, Feng Yunyou, Liu Shidu, Chen Zhenhe, Wan Xianghua, Sun Jinshun, Luo Douwen, Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Xu Buyun.</p>

<h3>Senior Billiards: Left-Handed General Wu Chengxiang Defeats Gain Yesterday</h3>
<p>1,000 to 755 Points; Zhang Yingda vs. Queshim Tonight</p>
<p>Left-handed General Wu Chengxiang defeated Gain with a score of 1,000 to 755 points in the Shanghai Amateur Billiards Senior Championship last night, reaching the semi-final week. He will compete with Zhu Qiliang, who overcame Ding Mingyi the night before, for the semi-final spot. With Wu's steady and excellent performance last night, the future of Wu and Zhu's game is very promising.</p>
<p>In Wu's battle against Gain last night, Gain had a lead of 40 to 50 points in the first 150 points. After passing this hurdle, Wu entered the road to success. Gain could only follow, but there were also one or two tense moments, with a difference of only four or five points. At the end of the first half, Wu led by 30 points with 500 to 470. In the second half, Wu's shooting was smoother, and Gain became the end of his rope. As a result, he won with 1,000 to 755 points. He had completed 1,000 points in the last shot of 27 points, and this shot was not over yet.</p>
<p>Recalling the league game, Gain had invited famous generals such as Zhang Yingda and Medina to defeat him. It is even more commendable that the left-handed general defeated him with this result.</p>
<p>Today is Zhang Yingda's game against Queshim, which is still divided into two games at 5:30 and 9:30 in the original location, 88 Nanjing Road. Zhang is confident of winning. The highest scores of Wu and Gain last night are recorded below: (Wu Chengxiang) First half: 3, 4, 37, 48, 23, 26; Second half: 29, 30, 22, 25, 9, 24, 20, 27.</p>

<h3>持志 Yesterday Lost to Five Dragons</h3>
<p>Score: 50 to 31</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Park basketball season opened with three games. The first game was between Youyou and Xiaguang of Group B, Part 1. Youyou had a full roster of talent, but due to imperfect coordination in the first half, they were behind 13 to 15. In the second half, they rallied strongly, with Cheng Yize, Sun Yize, and Sun Hupei scoring repeatedly, adding more than 30 points. Xiaguang only managed to scrape together 9 points. As a result, Youyou won by a large margin of 43 to 24. The second game was between Fuzhong and the Philippines of Group B, Part 2. The situation was relatively slow-paced. In the first half, Fuzhong only narrowly won 9 to 8. The final score was 26 to 15, with Fuzhong still winning. The final game was a Group A match between Chizhi and Five Dragons. Liu Jingfeng of Five Dragons was late, so Zhao Shouchang played the first half in his place. Liang Yunming, the main player of Chizhi, did not play due to an unhealed foot injury (he had already played against Mailing with difficulty last time). Gao Baosheng filled in for the right forward position, but the coordination was poor, leading to Five Dragons controlling the entire situation. Su Yinghai, who is best at basketball, was also unable to perform well yesterday. Therefore, except for the beginning when they were evenly matched, later it all became the world of Five Dragons. Although Chizhi showed some improvement in the final moments, ultimately time was not on their side. They suffered a crushing defeat of 50 to 31. Chizhi, who was invincible among the university teams of Western Qing, has also become a second-rate team in Shanghai Park. The progress of the game is as follows:</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>Wu Bixian won the jump ball in the center circle. He dribbled forward and scored, giving Five Dragons the first two points. Gao Baosheng broke into the basket and tied the score. Soon after, Wang Zhenlun shot from long range, and Li Zude made a free throw, putting Five Dragons ahead 5 to 2. At this time, both sides committed numerous fouls. Su Yinghai made one of three free throws and then scored again, tying the score at 5 each. Then both sides had double free throw opportunities. Xu Zhaoxiong made both, and Chen Xuechong made one and missed one. At 6 to 7, Chizhi fell behind from then on. After that, Li and Wu of Five Dragons added 5 points, making it 12 to 6. Gao and Chen of Chizhi scored, narrowing the gap to 10 to 12, and gradually getting closer. However, luck was not on their side. Gao Baosheng and Su Yinghai had multiple good chances under the basket, but they all missed. Li and Xu of Five Dragons, on the other hand, were successful on both sides, scoring three consecutive times, and leading all the way from then on, with a fierce momentum. After Chizhi called a timeout, they replaced Gao Baosheng with Xu Peisheng. After Chen Xuechong made it 12 to 21, Xu Zhaoxiong, Li Zude, and Wu Bixian of Five Dragons were unstoppable, quickly reaching 27 to 10. Chizhi showed some improvement with Qian Jincheng, and Chen Xuechong pushed the ball in under the basket. Five Dragons also called a timeout to avoid their momentum. Chizhi then brought Gao Baosheng back on. After that, the situation was very even. Zhao and Xu of Five Dragons made two free throws, and Chen Liangxiong of Chizhi also made two shots. The first half ended with Five Dragons 29 and Chizhi 16.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>After the break, Five Dragons replaced Zhao Shouchang with Liu Jingfeng as guard. Chizhi also replaced Chen Xuechong and changed Gao Baosheng to center, but it did not work out well. After the start, Five Dragons immediately increased their score by 6 points in one go, making it 35 to 16. Chizhi chased for two minutes before Zhang Liangxiong pushed a ball in with both hands. Then they got another point, but it was not worth the loss. Li Zude and Xu Zhaoxiong of Five Dragons shot accurately, adding as many as 11 points in an instant, making it 46 to 19. The victory was already certain. After that, Su Yinghai and Wang Jincheng of Chizhi successively withdrew and were replaced by Xu Peisheng and Shu Changge, which showed some improvement. Xu Nandeng immediately made a contribution, and Li Zude of Five Dragons also scored. But Xu and Zhan of Chizhi also scored, and Five Dragons brought Zhao Shouchang back on, but it was still difficult to stop their momentum. Xu Peisheng and Zhang Liangxiong then scored three consecutive goals, chasing to 31 to 48, showing a sign of revival. However, time was not on their side. There were only three and a half minutes left. The Chizhi players, due to being too anxious, missed four good chances by Zhang, Xu, and Gao. Then Xu Zhaoxiong of Five Dragons scored again, making it 50 to 31. Then Zhou Xuexian was brought on, and both sides made no achievements, and it ended like this. Five Dragons won a big victory.</p>

<h3>Boy Scout Self-Help Society Launches National Boy Scout Mobilization</h3>
<p>Collecting Waste and Performing Entertainment to Request Approval and Implementation from the General Association</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Boy Scout Self-Help Society of China has seen its affairs develop day by day. According to Zheng Haozhang, the person in charge of the society, in order to expand the Aid Sui movement and encourage the people's enthusiasm for saving the country, two suggestions have been made to the Nanjing Boy Scout General Association: one is a national general mobilization for waste collection. It is requested that the General Association issue an order to Boy Scouts in various places to collect all kinds of scrap iron, broken bottles, old paper, rotten cloth, and other items, and sell them publicly to raise funds to save the country. The second is a general mobilization for Boy Scout entertainment performances. It is requested that the General Association set a date and order Boy Scouts in various places to hold entertainment gatherings or bonfire gatherings, sell tickets, and raise funds to save the country. Both of the above mobilizations will be carried out by the Boy Scouts themselves, which is different from ordinary fundraising methods and will surely achieve significant results, and its own significance is also quite profound. It is heard that the society is currently awaiting approval from the General Association in order to actively promote it, and hopes that Boy Scouts across the country will respond.</p>

<h3>Glimpses of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Educational Administration</h3>
<p>Increased Subsidies and Added Elementary Schools Last Year</p>
<p>In 1931, the Shanghai Municipal Council decided on an educational policy aimed at increasing the number of Council schools and allocating municipal revenue to subsidize private schools, so that educational facilities in the Public Concession could be expanded and improved. Since the implementation of this policy, the number of Council schools has gradually increased. There are now five schools for Western children, five middle schools for Chinese children, six elementary schools for Chinese children, and two night schools for workers. The number of students has increased to 8,831. For non-Council schools, a subsidy system is adopted. Private schools located in the Public Concession, whose management, equipment, and teaching achievements are considered satisfactory by the Council and require financial subsidies, can be granted subsidies by the Council. There are currently 223 subsidized Chinese schools. The number of Chinese schools applying for subsidies increased last year, and the amount of subsidies that the Council could allocate was limited. After consideration, it was agreed to increase the amount by 19,000 yuan compared to the previous year. After this, the educational expenses borne by the Council will be nearly one-seventh of the total house tax collected. At the beginning of last year, the Council added an elementary school for Chinese children on Peng Road. The school is specifically designed for students from poor families who cannot afford to study. The tuition fee is only three yuan per semester, including books and stationery. Students are divided into morning and afternoon groups, each group being taught for three and a half hours. The duration of study is four years. The subjects taught are all basic knowledge, in line with the curriculum standards of the primary schools prescribed by the Ministry. The school can accommodate 1,200 students, and there are currently 1,138 students. It is expected to be full this year. Two night schools are attached to the Huishan Road Elementary School (girls) and the Jingzhou Road Elementary School (boys) to provide young male and female workers with extracurricular tutoring. The courses include reading, writing, arithmetic, hygiene, and civics. The two schools currently have more than 800 students. Regarding the future policy of running schools for Western children, a special committee was organized by the Council in October last year to consider issues such as saving expenses and allocating funds. The committee is currently studying this.</p>
<h3>Municipal Social Bureau Reopens Lubin Elementary School in Zhabei</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau has decided to reopen the Lubin Municipal Elementary School in the Zhabei District, which has been closed since the Shanghai War of 1937 for five years. There are not many elementary schools nearby, resulting in a large number of out-of-school children in the area. Ge Qingchen has been appointed to prepare for the reopening next semester. The school has now started registration and is scheduled to recruit new students on January 15th and 31st. The school address is Xing Shucun, Dongheng Hong Road.</p>

<h3>Several Secondary Education Issues Related to English Teaching (2)</h3>
<p>— Wang Shijie</p>
<p>Second, the knowledge cultivated in secondary education should emphasize both theory and experiment. This point is particularly important in today's secondary schools in China. Thousands of years ago, a great scholar pointed out the harms of learning without thinking and thinking without learning, encouraging people to use their minds on the one hand and observe things on the other. The excellent spirit of Chinese scholarship has always been to practice what one preaches. Unfortunately, for hundreds of years, because Chinese scholarship lacked scientific components, the way of scholarship has largely become empty, focusing on theory and neglecting experiment. As a result, theory lacks experimental basis. This is a long-standing problem in Chinese academia. For the past two or three decades, everyone has gradually felt this harm and has been able to cooperate to correct this problem. Considerable achievements have gradually become apparent, but the root of the problem is too deep, and it is difficult to achieve universal results without a longer period of effort. This problem is true in universities, and perhaps even more serious in middle schools. In the past two or four years, the Ministry of Education has conducted a fairly widespread test on this issue, namely, the graduation examinations for middle schools and normal schools. Perhaps everyone has already paid some attention to the results of the statistics of these past years of examinations. The usefulness of this examination is because it is not limited to a few schools or certain provinces and cities, but is a universal test for various places and schools across the country. It uses a relatively reliable method to point out a major shortcoming in secondary education across the country, namely that the grades of general schools are very bad in subjects such as physics, chemistry, and schoolwork. This is a fundamental problem in current secondary education. If secondary schools are like this, higher education will certainly not escape the influence, and the remedies that higher education can provide are also limited. At present, to promote science education, we should not just be satisfied with being able to imitate the curriculum and do a few sets of experiments. Because if there is no deeper and more thorough understanding, even if these few sets of experiments are done well, it will not be much higher than performing a few scientific tricks. What is called a deeper and more thorough understanding is the scientific attitude and the spirit of experimentation. Looking at the current situation, everyone has already recognized the importance of this issue, which is a very gratifying thing. In recent years, whether in universities or middle schools, Tianjia has paid considerable attention and made efforts in scientific equipment, teaching materials, teachers, and teaching methods. We can recognize that this is just a scaled and systematic starting point. If we compare secondary schools with universities in these areas, the number of secondary schools across the country is too large, and the level of their achievements is probably much worse than that of universities. In the future, secondary schools should make special efforts, so that we can hope that the scientific attitude and experimental spirit of students across the country can be gradually improved through considerable cultivation. This spirit and attitude, firmly established in the minds of young people, not only provides them with a good foundation for doing scholarship, but also cultivates honest, faithful, responsible, active, disciplined, and unwilling to be perfunctory character and conduct.</p>
<h3>School News</h3>
<p>Quanzhou-Tong'an Middle School, located on Longhua Road in this city, is funded and established by the Quanzhou-Zhangzhou Guild Hall in Shanghai and Guangzhou. The funding is independent and the management is strict. Recently, after Lu Xingyang succeeded as the headmaster of the school, all facilities have been further advanced. However, the school site has not been completely returned due to being borrowed by the municipal police bureau for police training, which restricts the number of students admitted. The school is truly cultivating children from poor families and admits students from all over the country, not limited to children from the same province. The tuition fees are also low, so the students who apply for the examination are always very crowded. The entrance examination for the current semester is scheduled to be held on February 1st.</p>

Due to a clearer turn in the current situation, public morale was increasingly boosted, and the market trend grew stronger. Major players were actively absorbing supply, and new shorts were wary, leading to tight supplies of publicly available shares. The trend for far-dated contracts was especially strong. Today is the settlement date for January futures, and the market is closed for one day. Yesterday morning, the market opened with an improved environment and high public interest, with retail investors actively buying, causing a uniform price increase of fifteen and thirty cents. Far-dated contracts traded about ten to thirty cents higher than near-dated contracts. In the second session, buying interest was even stronger, with numbers 16 and 77 seeing increased buying, while numbers 43 and 10 saw significant selling. Contracts such as 戌甲 continued to rise by ten to forty cents, while 乙種 for next month fell by five cents. In the afternoon session, number 77 continued to absorb a significant amount, and 戊種 for this month rose by ten cents. When 丁種 started, numbers 431 and 47 saw renewed buying interest, causing the market price to fall slightly by five to ten cents. At closing, the market condition was one of major players continuing to purchase and rally, with numbers 77 and 27 seeing continued buying, while numbers 10 and 43 saw slight selling. Contracts such as 丙乙 rose by about ten cents. Overall, February futures rose uniformly by fifty and fifty-five cents. March futures were newly opened, with a total transaction volume of 7.25 million yuan. A table comparing the price changes, highs, and lows is provided below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market Rebounds in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Although Production is Rapid, a Price Drop is Difficult</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon, but the momentum was calm. Both the long and short sides have considerable opposing strength. Indian merchants are unwilling to give up their large positions in February futures, absorbing around 50,000 bales, and hedging in March and April for about 30,000 to 40,000 bales. In this situation, they are riding a tiger and cannot easily let go. As for fellow traders, seeing the rapid increase in yarn mill production and the loosening fundamental conditions, with a surplus of spot yarn, they mostly hold a "sell on rally" strategy.</p>
<p>Indian Bulls Maintain Position</p>
<p>The opening of the raw yarn market saw flat prices across all months. In the first session, January futures suddenly fell, and the counterparty's position turned loose, mainly because a portion of the market bought forward yarn from the factories and hedged it with raw yarn. At the same time, spot sales were weak, and the unrest in the bulk three-grade yarn market affected market prices, further dampening morale. However, Indian merchants remained steadfast in their hold on February futures. As a result, prices for all months fell by 70 cents to 1.10 yuan compared to the previous day's close. In the afternoon session, with the slight recovery in the three-grade yarn market, it was said that Indian bulls were not letting go, and the counterparty's position tightened, causing market prices to rebound. As a result, prices for all months rose by 50, 80, and 90 cents compared to the morning close. Sold were: Yuda 3,100 bales, Yukang 500 bales, Zhenda 750 bales, Senkang 1,050 bales, Shenji 1,600 bales, Renfeng 800 bales, Yuan Yi 450 bales, Dachangcheng 1,150 bales, Da Li 2,150 bales, and Shengyuan 700 bales. Purchased were: Hexing 1,250 bales, Jinchang 2,150 bales, Mingde 1,400 bales, Fengshou 500 bales, Yichang 1,550 bales, Runkang 1,250 bales, Tonghe 1,150 bales, and Changfeng 650 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Raw Yarn Daily High, Low, and Closing Prices Compared to Previous Day's Inventory. January Futures, Ready for Delivery -- 13.750 February Futures 253.25 251.9 252.9 Down 0.20 172.650 March Futures 246.5 245.1 245.9 1.60 236.300 April Futures 245.9 244.9 245.9 Up 0.10 176.100 Total</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Exceed 900 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. Total sales by all groups today are estimated at 911 bales, with prices remaining flat. The sales volume for each group is listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Lingers with Fatigue</p>
<p>The cotton market completely lacks vitality and remains in a state of circling and hesitation throughout the day. Trading in the market is becoming increasingly quiet, with both long and short positions adopting a wait-and-see attitude. As the end of the lunar year approaches, most are preparing to close their accounts. Market prices have nothing exciting to report.</p>
<p>Limited Activity in Raw Cotton Market</p>
<p>The raw cotton market opened with a uniform decline in prices for all months, exhibiting a fatigued and weak sentiment. This is because the actual demand from cotton mills is stagnant, and the yarn market is relatively weak, further dampening morale. However, trading in the market is very light, and the market is increasingly sluggish. As a result, prices for all months fell by 5 to 10 cents compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon session saw no activity, with minimal trading. The auction lasted only 40 minutes before closing. As a result, February futures rose by 15 cents compared to the morning close, while the others remained unchanged. Sold were: Renfeng 1,900 dan, Chunchang 1,200 dan, Shengyuan 1,000 dan, Yongchang 1,000 dan, Dafu 1,100 dan, Yongda 1,100 dan, and Tonghe 1,100 dan. Purchased were: Taiyu 3,100 dan, Wangtaixing 1,000 dan, Yikang 2,800 dan, Hexing 1,600 dan, and Dachangcheng 1,000 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Depressed Spot Cotton Consumption</p>
<p>Regulations for cotton mills require quietness. The source is 1,700 bales of Yao cotton and 1,768 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Sale of Mortgaged American Cotton Unlikely to Have an Impact</p>
<p>Although There are Reports of Increased American Cotton Acreage, Prices Remain Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with prices up 1 to 3 points for all months. However, the decision that the terms for selling mortgaged cotton would not affect the market was announced. Traders actively bought March and May futures in large quantities, making the market very active. Outside buyers also increased. All large long positions being closed were absorbed. Inquiries for spot cotton were numerous, and prices for high-grade cotton gradually increased. The cloth market was quiet but firm. Later, due to Agriculture Secretary Wallace's statement that there were plans to increase cotton acreage and lower prices, a reaction occurred in the market. Finally, the stock market weakened, long positions were closed, and prices continued to fall. At closing, the market was stable. Spot prices rose by 9 points, while futures rose by 7 to 11 points. British spot cotton rose by 5 points, and futures rose by 8 points. The Indian cotton market is closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 26th).</p>
<p>Three-Grade Futures Yarn Rises, Spot Yarn Falls</p>
<p>Dalian telegram of the 27th: Spot yarn fell by 5 to 89. 16-count belongs to Mian 240 yuan, down 6 yuan. 20-count Goldfish 260 yuan, down 8 yuan. 40-count Five Stars 395 yuan, down 5 yuan. 42-count Pheasant 385 yuan, down 5 yuan. Three-grade futures yarn rose by 1.90 to 3 yuan. Near month is 257.60 yuan, far month is 250.60 yuan. Cotton futures rose by 10 cents to 1 yuan. Near month is 74.45 yuan, far month is 76.70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Sharp Increase in Cloth Prices, Reduced Transactions</p>
<p>Strong Demand for Plain Cotton Cloth in Spring from Various Regions Remains</p>
<p>Yesterday, raw yarn fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon, and the cloth market continued to hold firm. Demand for undyed Dong piece goods from dyehouses on this street remained good, and futures continued to rise. Major holders were aggressively manipulating the market, causing a sharp increase of about 10 cents per piece the day before yesterday, especially for grey cloth, which rose by 15 cents per piece. However, it stabilized yesterday, mainly because loading by various customers decreased significantly in the past few days. Merchants and dyehouses on this street, seeing the sharp increase in the market, reduced their purchasing interest. As a result, transactions for Dong piece goods were not strong the day before yesterday. About 100 to 150 pieces of Qingdao-bound fine cloth, fine twill, and dyed cloth were purchased by various merchants on this street. Heavy and light-weight coarse cloth from factories such as Ewo and Chentai were purchased by merchants on this street and inland Guangdong merchants for more than 400 packages. Sales of fine twill from this factory were sluggish, and production remained large, so the market sentiment was difficult to boost. Sales were flat. The spot price of spring damask is about one cent higher per yard than the original order price. Merchants from distant Sichuan and Guangdong have purchased some spot goods. Inland and local merchants still have a strong interest in hoarding, and storage is done in various places when prices are low. Transactions are particularly strong.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Far-Dated Flour Re-Enters the Four Yuan Level</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning, showed an initial flat trend followed by increases in prices for all months. The price of foreign wheat and the Chicago wheat market opened high. However, due to weak exports and Agriculture Secretary Wallace's statement that wheat acreage would be expanded and prices would fall, speculative long positions were closed, causing prices to fall together. At closing, the results were mixed, with gains of 1.25 to losses of 0.25, and minor gains of 0.48 for Chicago Canadian. Therefore, the opening price was very calm, with very little up and down compared to the previous day's market. However, January has passed, and the closing date is approaching, so traders are mostly waiting and watching. But outside investors are quite willing to buy, and the factories are unwilling to hedge, so although trading is quiet, prices are rising by two to three cents. When the afternoon session opened, trading remained sluggish, because the long positions were slightly offering, and the actual sales to various regions remained stagnant, so there was a slight softening. According to traders' speculation, during the closing period, because all industries are preparing to close, trading will be quiet, and the market will pass peacefully.</p>
<p>Outside Buying Interest in Wheat Futures is Strong Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a slightly better trend for all months after opening in the morning. Because January is in delivery, the total amount is said to be as high as 119 cars. With this situation, stockpiles were inevitably cleared, causing unexpected activity. Therefore, although foreign wheat was slightly lower, buying interest was relatively stronger. February and March were good by three to four cents. April and June initially showed fatigue, then rebounded. When the afternoon session opened, it was said that the goods delivered this month were returning to the factory, and those with spot goods in hand were mostly hedging, causing the market sentiment to return to flat. Because factories are not greedy for spot wheat, customers are hedging at any time according to standards, so no transactions were seen.</p>
<p>Summary of January Miscellaneous Grain Deliveries</p>
<p>Deliveries of miscellaneous grains were all strong. 28 cars of standard soybeans, 10,000 dan of soybean oil, and 70 labels of standard foreign sesame were delivered. In this situation, the domestic miscellaneous grain reserves are really abundant. It is unthinkable that speculators have excessively raised prices in recent months.</p>
<p>Foreign Sesame Continues to Fall by 15 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign sesame fell because the goods owner was closing out, but the foreign firms remained unmoved. About 1,000 tons were still traded through the Central Trust Bureau, with prices said to be 14.85 yuan and 14.75 yuan. With the turn in soybean market conditions in Dalian, morale was stabilized, but the outbound route could not be excited, so the market has not been easy to rise. Yesterday, it was estimated that five cars of Bengbu beans were taken by oil mills. More than 200 packages of Dingjia Zhou beans from this street's mainland were traded, as well as two to three hundred packages of Hankou Zhadou beans, 408 packages of 98 Winter beans, and more than 100 packages of Pinghu Doudou beans.</p>
<p>Slight Improvement in Hexia Rice Market</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of various currencies was less than before, only arriving on the 27th and 28th, with about 5,700 to 800 shi of goods, including thin rice on the 13th. The sales market on this street continued to be active, and groups such as Baowei also handled more than 2,000 packages of thin rice, so the price of thin rice rose by about one jiao. The price of thick japonica rice also increased by one jiao to one jiao and a half. The Du Yangjian market also showed activity.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, ships from various ports in Hexia on the 26th and 27th, the sales of various goods in the market were mobilized, and the white japonica rice in the market rebounded by one jiao and a half. Fu rice also followed closely, the price of thin rice increased by seven to eight cents, the price of Yangdu Bujian increased by nearly one jiao, the price of Kejian was slightly tight, and the price of Baiyuan increased by several cents. The rest of the goods also had an upward trend.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Increasing Shortage of Dried Cocoons, More Silk Mills Shutting Down</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market remained weak. Japanese and American silk prices continued to decline. New York recent futures fell by two and a half to three points, and spot Bin fell sharply by 20 yuan, with JinCai falling to the 885 yuan level, and futures also fell by 18 yuan. Therefore, the export silk market in this port became increasingly lifeless, and the white factories followed the market decline, with sluggish trading. Both domestic and foreign sales were extremely small, and trading records were difficult to use as a market standard. Silk mills continued to shut down due to the tight supply of raw materials. As of mid-August last year, there were 48 silk mills operating in this port, with 11,118 silk reeling machines. Later, due to the increasing shortage of dried cocoons, they were gradually forced to shut down. As of recently, only 15 factories remained, including Jiyu, Jiu Yu, Fu Li, Hengcang, and Xinchang, with only 3,200 machines. However, they will also stop production one after another due to the unsustainable supply of raw materials. Yesterday, foreign firms in this port sold a total of 40 packages, and the price of white factory goods fell by 10 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Authorized Black Iron Sheets: Traders Reluctant to Sell Lightly</p>
<p>The price of 18-gauge authorized black iron sheets has increased from 13 yuan to 14 yuan yesterday, and trading is very strong. However, traders do not have many spot goods and are reluctant to sell lightly, so the market is unusually tight. According to a market survey, sales reached more than 2,300 bundles, purchased by thermos bottle factories and enamel factories. A small amount was also sold to out-of-town groups.</p>
<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Observations on the Export of Dried Cocoons</h3>
<p>— Jin Sheng</p>
<p>Recently, the issue of exporting dried cocoons has become a serious concern. Some say they are being shipped abroad to manufacture munitions, while others say local silk mills are being forced to shut down. There are many different opinions, and it is difficult to reach a consensus. The Silk Mill Association of this city has held emergency meetings to find ways to stop it. The Shanghai Shen Bao newspaper published a special edition on the 8th, which also included Mr. Jianping's remarks on the large-scale export of dried cocoons, with many comments on national economic planning and people's livelihood. However, this is only a superficial observation. If viewed from a strict perspective, the crux of the matter does not seem to be the pursuit of profit by a few cocoon merchants, but rather the survival of the entire national silk mill industry. The author of this article has been working in silk mills for many years and is very interested in discussing this issue. Therefore, I will briefly express my views, which should be welcomed by those who care about the silk industry, and also provide some reference for government agencies.</p>
<p>Although there are more than 100 silk reeling factories in this city, there are actually only 50 or 60, with 40 or 50 in operation. Some of the remaining factories have been dismantled, some have been reorganized into cloth factories, and others have been converted into other factories. This is because it is not easy for operators to succeed.</p>
<p>The quality of silk mill products depends on the quality of the machinery. At present, most of the silk mills operated by the Zhejiang Provincial Government have been upgraded with the latest multi-line machines. Private silk mills have also installed new-style machines with government loans. The factories operated by Xue Shouxuan, a silk industry tycoon in Wuxi, and the newly established Xingye Company have also been converted to multi-line machines and heavy reeling machines. This city is different. Except for Baotai, Ewo, Jiyu, Zhongxing, and five or six other factories that have been upgraded with semi-new-style heavy reeling machines, most are still using Italian-style silk reeling machines from decades ago. Reeling silk is against Che Lin. Five years ago, the multi-line machine of the Mimikawa style, which was considered the latest style, is now considered obsolete and has been replaced by the new-style machine produced by Zengtan Company.</p>
<p>The importance of silk mill machinery is as described above. Now, silk mills in this city, with old-style machinery, have difficulty meeting the uniformity requirements for silk production, and the silk body is not clean. Therefore, in the author's opinion, the export of dried cocoons is more reasonable because foreign countries have newer machinery, better technology, and need high-quality raw materials to reel high-grade silk. As for manufacturing munitions, I dare not speculate, because silk is a major export of our country, and if cocoons can be used to make munitions, why can't silk? From this point of view, silk cannot be exported either. Therefore, the author believes that the export of dried cocoons is not only not pessimistic, but also something to be congratulated on. The country with the largest silk production in the world is our eastern neighbor, and the raw materials are also the best. This time, the buyers of cocoons did not seek them from Japan, but from our country, which shows that the raw materials of dried cocoons in our country are of excellent quality and are still being adopted by foreign countries. In the future, how should our country's silk be improved and strive for excellence is the effort of those who operate silk mills.</p>
<p>The national dried cocoon production in the spring, summer, autumn, and late autumn seasons last year was estimated at about 300,000 dan. According to the Yun Ri Bao newspaper, the amount to be exported this time is only over 1,000 dan, which is less than 1%. It is hoped that the leaders of the Silk Mill Association will not consider the prohibition of exports as having done their best. They should immediately investigate the purpose of foreign cocoon purchases. If it is indeed being shipped for silk reeling, they should lead the national silk mill industry to catch up quickly, such as how to improve machinery and how to improve technology, so as to change the current 1% export into a continuous export. Then the future of the silk industry will be promising.</p>
<p>As far as the author knows, the reason why silk mills in this city are forced to stop production is not because of the depletion of raw materials, but because the purchase price does not match. At present, there are still tens of thousands of dan of dried cocoons stockpiled in the warehouses of this city and Wuxi. Unfortunately, the current market price of dried cocoons is 200 yuan per dan. Calculating the reeling of one dan of silk with 430 to 440 catties of raw materials, the cocoon cost must be 800 to 100 yuan, plus the other cost is 70 to 80 yuan, so the cost of each dan of silk must be more than 900 yuan. According to the current average silk price, each dan is only about 800 yuan, not only no profit can be made, but also the cost must be lost. That is why operators have to find another way to survive. As for the high-grade silk sold abroad, although the price is also more than 900 yuan per dan, the reeling of this silk must have the latest machinery and well-trained workers to be effective. Furthermore, since the government implemented raw silk inspection, the products of local silk mills have been difficult to pass the grade. Most regard exports as a daunting task and have to consider the next best thing, which is to sell to domestic silk weaving mills. This phenomenon cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Regarding the prohibition of exports, it does not seem to be a thorough solution, because the raw materials related to the national economy and people's livelihood are not only dried cocoons. For example, flour mills related to people's food have not prohibited the export of wheat, and textile mills related to people's livelihood have not prohibited the export of cotton. Now, considering the export of a small number of dried cocoons as very important is really abandoning the essentials and pursuing the trivialities, which makes foreigners laugh. Now try to prove the facts of the former double palace silk factory, which can be used as a lesson. In the spring of 1931, there were six double palace silk factories in this city. At that time, they conspired to prohibit the export of double palace cocoons so that the raw materials were sufficient to be self-sufficient. On the one hand, they asked the government to increase taxes to avoid foreign transportation, so that the tax silver paid for each dan of double palace cocoons jumped from three taels to eleven taels. In fact, it was making a cocoon to bind itself. How long did it take? Most of these six double palace silk factories could not bear the burden and closed down one after another. Only one is still struggling to survive. At the beginning of the double official silk factory's idea, it was thought to be perfect, but unexpectedly, the benefits of itself have not been received, and the harm of the industry has been tasted. At present, the annual double palace tax loss of silk merchants is no less than hundreds of thousands of yuan, which cannot be said to be a huge number. Therefore, in recent years, cocoon merchants have not hesitated to transform the best double palace cocoons into cut-mouth waste cocoons and transport them for export. This one thing can serve as a proof.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the export of dried cocoons should seek salvation methods from the root, and it is definitely not to close the door and conserve, which will lead to the phenomenon of creating a deep-sea drive fish and driving sparrows into the jungle. The author's reckless participation in the final discussion, try to describe the remedy as follows.</p>
<p>㊀ “Promote seed production” so that silk merchants and cocoon bank leaders in this city can intervene in the silkworm seed situation without being alienated.</p>
<p>㊁ Sericulture cooperation and production and sales cooperation to avoid cocoon merchants hoarding.</p>
<p>㊂ “The government should use the international market to stipulate the price of domestic cocoons and silk”, and cannot use the market price of the Japanese and American exchanges as the standard, because the price was raised by 50 or 60 yuan per dan in both spring and autumn last year.</p>
<p>㊃ “Improve machinery”, all old-style machinery in silk mills must be improved.</p>
<p>㊄ “Cultivate technicians and improve worker skills” so that the products will become more and more sophisticated.</p>
<p>㊅ “The government controls the sales agency and establishes overseas sales offices” so that the national silk cocoon trade can be unified.</p>
<p>All of these are related to the overall plan. At the beginning of this happy year, everything is new. If we can work hard to carry out, then all problems will not be difficult to solve. The author's pipe-watching is very limited, and the vastness of the sea is vast. If it is extended and broadened, then it will be fortunate.</p>

<h3>Cavendish</h3>
<p>— Songshan</p>
<p>Henry Cavendish 1731-1810</p>
<p>The great British chemist and physicist Henry Cavendish was born on October 10, 1731, in Nice. In 1742, he was sent to a school in Hackney to study; in 1749, he entered Cambridge University. He left Cambridge without obtaining a degree and went to Paris to specialize in mathematics and physics.</p>
<p>Until the age of forty, he lived a meager existence on a small allowance from his father. In his later years, he inherited a large fortune. Having been accustomed to poverty, sudden wealth only added to his troubles and exacerbated his eccentricities. He detested socializing, refusing all engagements except for attending meetings of the Royal Society and the weekly Thursday dinners at his members' club. He seemed to strive to avoid attracting attention. Even his relatives rarely encountered him; he allowed his heir only a brief meeting of a few minutes each year.</p>
<p>He grew increasingly averse to seeing people. He would write his daily meal requirements on a piece of paper, place it on a table in the hall, and have the maid take it to fulfill the order. If the maid was seen by him, she would be dismissed. His favorite dish was leg of lamb. One day, a guest stayed at his home for a meal. The maid asked him from behind the wall what dish to serve the guest. He said, "Naturally, leg of lamb!" The maid anxiously asked, "How can a single leg of lamb be enough?" He frowned and said, "Then two will do!"</p>
<p>He was tall and thin, and his clothes were extremely old-fashioned and rarely changed. When the tailor came to take his measurements, he deliberately put on tattered clothing. He spoke haltingly and always appeared shy and uncomfortable in front of people. Because he feared women, he never married. Only one portrait of him exists, created by an enthusiastic painter who first measured his clothes and hat and then secretly added his facial features.</p>
<p>On February 24, 1810, he died quietly in Clapham. His estate was substantial: seven hundred thousand pounds in cash, eight thousand pounds in annual land revenue, and fifty thousand pounds in his own bank. After his death, his body was buried in All Saints Church in Derby. In 1927, those who revered him erected a monument on his grave to commemorate him.</p>
<p>Cavendish's scientific work was extensive, but he published little during his lifetime. Many of his research findings were made public only after his death. His first contribution to the Royal Society was a chemical treatise titled "Factitious Airs," which mainly discussed "inflammable air" (hydrogen) and "fixed air" (carbon dioxide). He was the first to recognize hydrogen as an element. He determined the specific gravity of the constituent gases of air and their solubility in different liquids. He discovered that the "fixed air" obtained from decay and fermentation had the same properties as the "fixed air" obtained from chalk. He also made significant improvements to scientific experimentation, such as the use of desiccants and the correction of gas volumes for pressure and temperature. Later, he published a paper titled "Analysis of London Water," in which he stated that water containing lime could absorb "fixed air"; lime and "fixed air" combined to form chalk, which could precipitate along with the chalk originally in the water. In 1783, he studied the composition of the atmosphere, spending almost sixty days on the air experiment. In 1781, he concluded that the proportions he had previously obtained were correct and that there was little difference in air from different locations.</p>
<p>Three or four years later, his paper, "Experiments on Air," was published, containing his great discovery: the nature of water and the composition of nitric acid. John Warltire had previously conducted an experiment in which air and hydrogen were mixed and subjected to an electric spark, resulting in a reduction in volume and the formation of water mist. Cavendish meticulously repeated this experiment: burning a mixture of two parts hydrogen and five parts air produced water; he also mixed hydrogen and oxygen in a specially made glass vessel and obtained water by passing an electric spark through it. In this experiment, he discovered that the water produced contained nitric acid. In a second paper, he described his method of discovering the composition of nitric acid. He also found that one-one hundred and twentieth of "incombustible air" was a different gas from the known gases. Argon, discovered a hundred years later, was actually hinted at by him.</p>
<p>Although he believed in the "phlogiston theory," he was not as stubborn as Priestley. His paper "Experiments on Gases" mentioned that many natural phenomena could be explained by Lavoisier's theory. However, he still did not accept Lavoisier's theory, adhering to his "phlogiston theory."</p>
<p>Apart from two unimportant papers, Cavendish's writings on electricity were compiled by James Clerk Maxwell in 1879 as "The Electrical Researches of the Honourable Henry Cavendish." From this book, we can learn that he had anticipated the research work of Coulomb, Faraday, and others. He had studied the capacitance of Leyden jars, the power of static electricity discharge, and had even anticipated Ohm's law!</p>
<p>He also studied heat. If he had published his results quickly, he undoubtedly would have been credited with the discovery of latent heat and specific heat before Joseph Black. In 1783, he published a paper discussing the freezing point of mercury, expressing doubt about the Fluid Theory of Heat. His final achievement was the experiment to determine the density of the Earth, using an instrument given to him by Rev. John Michell. Initially, he thought the density of the Earth was 5.48, but after twenty-nine experiments, the average obtained was 5.448. His later work discussed the height of the aurora and the improvement of astronomical instruments.</p>
<p>George Wilson wrote his biography, which was published in 1851 by the Cavendish Society. It contained all of Cavendish's published and unpublished works. Some of the instruments used by Cavendish are still preserved in the Royal Society. In order to commemorate this sage, the seventh Duke of Devonshire built a "Cavendish Physical Laboratory" for him. He kept Cavendish's surviving works in the Royal Society. In 1921, his previously published and unpublished experiments were compiled into a book called "The Scientific Papers of the Honourable Henry Cavendish," containing two volumes: "Electrical Researches" and "Chemical and Dynamical Researches."</p>
<p>Cavendish was a very great scientist, but unfortunately, his temperament was too eccentric, and he was unwilling to publish in a timely manner, leaving many important discoveries behind, and therefore could not enjoy great fame. Otherwise, I think he might have surpassed Sir Isaac Newton!</p>

<h3>How to Study Philosophy (8)</h3>
<p>— Yan Yilin</p>
<p>Fu Shu, published by Sanjiang Bookstore</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The most important characteristic of this book is its objective explanation of philosophical research methods, the summary of the content of philosophy, and the summary of the history of the development of philosophy. Even when explaining what philosophy is as a science or why philosophy should be studied, it uses its objective viewpoint. For example, the explanation given for the word "philosophy" is from an objective standpoint, as can be seen from an accurate and specific description. If you read idealistic philosophy, it begins by leading you into a vague and mysterious world, making it unfathomable. This is naturally not a matter of the reader's level but because its content has no solid basis. If its mystical cloak is removed, the emptiness of its theory cannot be concealed. But this does not mean that idealists deliberately mystify, but because they have not maintained a correct research attitude, and many objective reasons have pushed them onto the forked road of philosophy.</p>
<p>When discussing why philosophy should be studied, the same objective approach is used. The author clarifies that the requirements of philosophical research are caused by the guidance and compulsion of human practical life, and also says that because of writing and practice, there is also a need to study philosophy. This specific statement is fundamentally based on objective aspects.</p>
<p>Because this book discusses research methods from a scientific point of view, it pays special attention to empirical and experimental methods. Therefore, it advocates using an objective mirror in the study of philosophy. To understand the natural philosophy of each era, it requires verifying the truth of the natural things that can be discovered and recognized in that era. To understand the social philosophy of each era, it is necessary to use the mirror of social reality, seeking the essence, form, and theoretical verification of philosophical thought on the social foundation. And it inevitably takes practice as one of the research empirical methods, recognizing practice as the only advanced research method that enables the theoretical system to develop from the inherent stage to a new stage.</p>
<p>This scientific viewpoint is passed through every chapter of the book, which means that the author is standing on the correct standpoint to talk about "How to Study Philosophy" and the summary of philosophical content and its history of development.</p>
<p>Since this book discusses philosophy using scientific research methods, it inevitably contains the meaning of "criticism"; this is also one of the main characteristics of this book. Containing the meaning of "criticism" is a good introductory book. When we read introductory books on various subjects, we often feel a great regret—that is, the content of introductory books often merely piles up many different opinions in a chaotic manner. Its author simply transmits various different sounds like a phonograph, leaving beginners at a loss as to what to follow. Introductory books on philosophy, especially those with complex content, are more prone to this problem. Since this book contains the meaning of "criticism," it will naturally enable beginners to directly enter the door, understand the gains and losses of its basic schools, and not be left to wander aimlessly or be misled by the theories of various schools, not knowing what to follow, or even unfortunately running onto the wrong path.</p>
<p>Another major characteristic of this book is that it unintentionally leads the reader into the correct philosophical thought. This "leadership" effect originally speaks from the correct standpoint and is the inevitable influence given to the reader by an introductory book containing the meaning of "criticism." In fact, it is the author's proper task; an author writes a book and distributes it to the world, naturally wanting it to be beneficial. In particular, so-called introductory books must lead readers into correct thought or give readers basic and systematic knowledge, and only then can it be said to have fulfilled its mission.</p>
<p>The above are the main characteristics of the content of this book. Here, let's examine its formal aspects.</p>
<p>The most important characteristic of the formal aspect is that the form is extremely concise. This can be divided into two aspects: first, in terms of the organization of the entire book, because the order of the narrative follows the correct thread, it feels exceptionally precise. Especially when talking about the outline of philosophy, it is like a botanist wanting to know the age of a tree and seeing the annual rings on the cross-section of the tree trunk, giving the reader a very accurate understanding and understanding of the subject of "philosophy." This book uses extremely few pages to explain the summary of philosophical content: on the one hand, it presents the key points of philosophical content, and on the other hand, it puts forward the views of the two major basic camps of philosophical schools on the fundamental propositions of philosophy. This specific and essential explanation method is undoubtedly the most economical. When explaining the summary of the history of the development of philosophy, the same economical means are used. It makes a new division of the periods of the history of the development of philosophy, which is a reasonable and economical narrative method. Moreover, in the narrative, it constantly pays attention to the historical ups and downs and the progress of the two major schools of idealism and materialism. The second is the compactness and conciseness of the writing. Although it repeatedly explains the research methods of philosophy and the outline of philosophy, when we read it, we only feel its compactness and conciseness because this repetition in explanation is not regression but a higher progression. In short, the compression of the form is often the element of presenting its outline, which increases the reader's attention, and the effect is to quickly give people a correct understanding, so as not to make people fall into a state of confusion due to the chaotic order of the narrative. Therefore, it is said that a good book is determined by the merits of both its content and form, and a beautiful form is also a necessary component of a good book.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire book, the characteristics of the content are: objectively discussing philosophical research methods, outlines, and their history of development; it contains the meaning of "criticism," and it leads the reader into the correct philosophical thought; the characteristic of the formal aspect is that it has an extremely economical form. These characteristics are where its value lies. (End)</p>
<h3>Yuan Changying's The Peacock Flies Southeast and Other Plays (4)</h3>
<p>— Kuifeng</p>
<p>2. Other One-Act Plays</p>
<p>D. Overall Play Structure</p>
<p>The conscious effect of Yuan Changying's creation of various one-act plays can be seen roughly in the first section. The epochal significance and value of each play need not be discussed at present.</p>
<p>However, from the current perspective, some places in the technique of criticizing each play cannot be said to be perfect.</p>
<p>If a script is not only used for performance, but also as a script to be read, I can say nothing more. However, there is no playwright who does not hope that it can be performed, otherwise, it loses the meaning of the play itself.</p>
<p>Regrettably, most of these five one-act plays are not suitable for stage techniques. To put it briefly, there are huge problems in plays such as The Living Poet and The Frontline Soldier. In The Living Poet, the section where the yellow dog catches the cat is probably impossible to realize; in The Frontline Soldier, the appearance of Sun Yat-sen's spirit has two such scenes inserted in one act, plus (dimly on the back curtain: suddenly a vast ocean appears; a violent storm and rain at sea compete to rage; thunder and sea roar, shaking people's hearts, on this gloomy and stormy sea, a large ship faintly floats, the ship is full of terrified creatures looking at each other, frowning. The ship is unsteady in the middle of the sea, and there is an obvious danger of sinking, only one rope is on the shore, and a group of people are desperately dragging it. Among the people on the shore, one appears particularly tall and majestic. This is clearly Sun Yat-sen……)</p>
<p>These should belong to stage effects, but such stage effects are often used for revolving stages of Journey to the West-style ghost plays, which cannot be done in spoken drama. At the same time, this kind of play that is close to illusionistic expression is not a technique that spoken drama should use.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not easy to be fair to criticize from the current perspective. However, to mention its obvious shortcomings, even in the situation at the time, it was probably a play that was not suitable for stage performance.</p>
<p>The author's efforts in creating drama can be seen in this booklet. At the time, this achievement of the author was perhaps a very rare harvest. From a historical perspective, Yuan's ability to expose the various aspects of society at that time has its own value that cannot be buried. For such a playwright, we extremely hope that she will continue to work hard and create more scripts that meet the needs of the current era.</p>
<p>Recently, in the Literary and Art section of the Ta Kung Pao, I read a prose poem in the form of a one-act play by Yuan, Lakeside Xuanwu. It is evident that the author has not forgotten the creation of plays. However, the subject matter and expression methods of Lakeside Xuanwu, regardless of whether they meet the needs of the era, the food that the text itself gives us is indeed not enough.</p>
<p>A literary worker who follows the advancement of the times, on the one hand, certainly has his own unique ideals, and on the other hand, should also look back at reality. This is a feeling I have after reading Yuan Changying's new and old plays.</p>
<p>Note: I personally read very little, and I don’t have many opportunities to browse magazines and books. I expect that Yuan has other plays that I have not discovered. The viewpoint of this article should specifically state that it does not summarize all of Yuan's dramatic works. (End)</p>
<h3>"The Story of Money" (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yupuo</p>
<p>Published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>"The Story of Money" by Norman Angell, the British political commentator and economist, can be called a very valuable and interesting book of common knowledge of economics. There are more than a thousand kinds of books on the records, history, and opinions of money that have been published in the world. However, they are either too specialized in the material, too profound in the viewpoint, or too dry in the writing, and are not easily understood by the general public. Among them, this "Story of Money" does not have the shortcomings of similar books, so it is easy for the general reader to read and understand. Because of the story style and simple language of this book, we can read it in one breath, and it is full of fun. Not only do we know the various situations and stories of ancient and modern money in various parts of the world, but also understand the principles and theories of money, and also gain some common knowledge of economics. Indeed, it has exhausted the functions of interest and knowledge for our readers.</p>
<p>This is not an accidental achievement of the author writing this book, but it is due to his intention, so he can achieve the perfect purpose according to his plan. He clearly stated his writing purpose in the preface: ㊀ The experience of mankind with money; ㊁ Several important experiments of mankind with money and their results; ㊂ The various errors that mankind has made on money. In addition, he has also predetermined such standards for the application of materials: "This book is completely for the general public, and all those that are too specialized in nature will be avoided as much as possible, except when necessary to understand the fundamental problems." He wrote according to his own announced writing purpose and standards, so he was very successful.</p>
<p>Now, let's briefly talk about the content of this book. The book includes fourteen chapters, from the formation of money, the initial money, the lending of money and its interest, the paper money produced with the rented money, to the collapse of modern monetary institutions, and opinions on monetary reform. Everything about the history, phenomena, and all issues of money is discussed, which can be regarded as the ultimate in perfection. Among these chapters, the "First Money" chapter is the most interesting; the author adopts a paper style to explain the definition and function of money, and uses a story style to narrate the forms, materials, and their values and credits of the first money in various parts of the world. As for the author's view on the definition of money, it is quite correct. He said this:</p>
<p>What is called money must have four conditions, namely: ㊀ It can be circulated to pay for the price of goods and their silver; ㊁ When receiving it, it is prepared to pay to others; ㊂ When receiving it, there is no need to give special inspection and occupancy to its quality and quantity; ㊃ When receiving it, there is no need to ask about the credit of the other party. (See page 72)</p>
<p>Originally, the definition of money is the most difficult to explain; this is because it is impossible to summarize all the phenomena of money in one word. However, the author can explain the broad meaning of money from the above four conditions, which can be said to be difficult and valuable. Furthermore, he further supplements the above definition from the function of money, which gives a clearer explanation of his definition. He said:</p>
<p>As for the function of money, the general definition is generally considered to be a medium of transaction, a measure of value, a standard of debt repayment, and a accumulation of value. In other words, those who can fulfill the four functions of medium, scale, standard, and accumulation are money.</p>

<p>The workers in the bone and ivory carving industry went on strike after many shops failed to implement the unified wage, which was agreed upon at the labor-management mutual aid conference of the industry and announced on January 1, 1937.

Fearing the expansion of the labor unrest, the higher authorities ordered the trade union members to resume work first and await mediation. After receiving the order, the industry's trade union immediately ordered all workers to resume work yesterday morning.

<h3>Directors of the Guangdong-Hankou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways Met Yesterday to Discuss</h3>
<p>Solutions for the Shanghai-Guangdong Through Train; Vehicles Will Be Leased from the Wan Guo Company; Expected to Be Implemented in October This Year</p>
<p>The Shenshi News Agency reports that the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong are the essence of Southeast China, with highly developed agriculture, industry, and commerce. Since the opening of the Guangdong-Hankou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Zhejiang-Gan Railways last year, the central provinces have been able to connect, which has had a great impact on regulating inter-provincial finance and developing national economic construction. However, the five provinces have not yet been able to connect by train. Recognizing this, the railway authorities, led by the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, initiated joint transportation on the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Guangdong-Hankou Railways, so that direct through trains could run between Shanghai and Guangzhou, which is very different from the current transportation between Shanghai and Guangdong, which relies solely on foreign merchant ships. This can also recover huge losses.</p>
<p>Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The leader of this matter is the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Zhou Zhongqi, the deputy director of the railway, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Du Zhenyuan, the director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Together with the directors of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, they held a meeting at the Railway Building yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter. The attendees included Du Zhenyuan, Zhou Zhongqi, He Molin, and Xiao Weiguo. The following resolutions were made: 1. Joint transportation on the three railways will follow the model of joint transportation between the Shanghai-Nanjing and Tianjin-Pukou Railways. 2. The funding issue will be handled jointly by the three railways. 3. The vehicle allocation will be borne by the three railways, and the application for rental from the Wan Guo Sleeping Car Company will also be made. After reaching an agreement with the Wan Guo Company within a few days, they will jointly formulate measures and submit them to the Ministry of Railways for approval, and then implement them on a scheduled basis.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong Direct Service</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to Zhou Zhongqi, the director of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau, the issues of joint transportation on the three railways have already been resolved. Once the Qianjiang Railway Bridge project is completed in August of this year, the Shanghai-Guangdong through train service can begin in October of this year. The train service has also been largely decided, with one train departing from Shanghai and Guangzhou every day, aiming for the most complete and fastest speed, completing the entire journey in more than forty hours. The train will pass through Hangzhou, Nanchang, Zhuzhou, and other places, allowing passengers to view the scenery of several southeastern provinces of China. Therefore, it is expected that this route will definitely develop in the future.</p>
<p>Hangzhou-Yushan Track Replacement</p>
<p>As for the issue of replacing the tracks on the Hangzhou-Yushan section with heavy rails, it is also being actively carried out due to the operation of through trains. According to Du Zhenyuan, the director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, the first batch of rail materials for the track replacement on the Hangzhou-Yushan section will arrive in Hangzhou in March, the second batch in April, and the last batch in June. By October, the replacement will be completely completed. Currently, the reconstruction of bridges on the Hangzhou-Yushan section with steel and concrete is progressing rapidly. It is heard that the business of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was quite prosperous last year and is expected to develop even more in the future.</p>
<h3>Liu Hangchen Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Liu Hangchen, the Director of Finance of the Sichuan Provincial Government, recently went to Nanjing from Shanghai to report on the financial situation of the province to the authorities. Having completed his official duties, he arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. He is expected to stay for two or three days and then return to Sichuan with Fu Zhenwu, the Chief of Staff of the Sixth Route Army Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Death of Austrian Consul Walter Mühler</h3>
<p>The Austrian Consul in Shanghai, Walter Mühler, passed away at his residence on Anhe Temple Road in the French Concession yesterday morning due to illness, at the age of 50. Mühler had been ill for a long time and had been unable to go to the consulate on Sichuan Road to work. His remains were sent to the International Funeral Home for cremation that day. His wife is currently living in Shanghai and has no children. Mühler had lived in Shanghai for 18 years and was well-known among the Austrian community. He also served as the director of the export department of the Lu Lin Trading Company for many years.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Withholding Income Tax Should Follow the Example of the Silver and Money Industry</h3>
<p>Various Chambers of Commerce Jointly Send a Telegram Request</p>
<p>Representatives from the Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxian, and 14 other chambers of commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing the other day, stating: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, the silver and money industry is allowed to deduct 10/1000 as a handling fee from the 50/1000 tax rate for withholding income from savings interest. This has already been implemented in Shanghai. Our associations believe that other companies, businesses, factories also receive savings deposits and have the same responsibility of withholding. The method should be uniform. We request that the Ministry approve the handling of the silver and money industry by analogy, to show fairness. Awaiting instructions, the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce, Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce, Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce, Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, Changshu County Chamber of Commerce, Qingpu County Chamber of Commerce, Kunshan County Chamber of Commerce, Fengxian County Chamber of Commerce, Shaoxing County Chamber of Commerce, Yixing County Chamber of Commerce, Wujin County Chamber of Commerce, Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce, representatives attending the Income Tax Research Association, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully kowtow."</p>

<p>In order to understand the domestic mining situation, the Mining Association of the Republic of China conducted a large-scale survey last year. It has now been compiled into a detailed table. The table lists a total of 143 mining companies, with coal mines accounting for the majority, followed by tin mines. Other metal mines, such as lead, copper, manganese, antimony, etc., are even rarer. The total amount of capital, excluding nine companies that did not list it, reached a total of National Currency 103,824,953.60 yuan, plus English gold 4,264,328 pounds and Hong Kong currency 337,550 yuan. China is rich in mineral resources, and less than one-tenth of them are currently being developed. At this time of active construction, we must rely on the continued efforts of the Chinese people. Based on the information obtained from the association's survey, statistics are compiled and described as follows:</p>
<p>Types of Mineral Deposits</p>
<p>During the survey, the association first sent letters to the construction departments of various provinces to find out that there were no fewer than 900 mining companies under their jurisdiction. Then, they sent survey forms to each company separately. They gradually received responses from 143 companies. The larger-scale mines in the country have not been missed. As for the small and medium-sized mines, or those that have just been established, or those that have been suspended midway, or those that have changed addresses, it was not possible to fully investigate them all. However, by compiling statistics on the mines that have already been investigated, we can see a general overview of China's mining industry. Among the 143 companies, coal mines account for 62%, tin mines account for 11%, iron mines account for 3%, tungsten mines account for 6%, other metal mines account for 8%, and stone mines account for 9%. The total amount of capital for each type is: coal mines total more than 98.1 million yuan, tin mines total more than 3.3 million yuan, and although there are only two gold mines, they also have 1.4 million yuan. Stone mines and other metal mines are relatively few.</p>
<p>Distribution of Each Mine</p>
<p>First, let's talk about coal mines. The distribution is the most in Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, and Hebei, followed by Sichuan, with nine companies. However, their scale is not large, and the highest capital is only 50,000 yuan. Hubei and Anhui provinces are next. There are also one or two in Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Chahar, Guangdong, Hunan, Guizhou, Suiyuan, Yunnan, etc. Calculating the amount of investment in coal mines in each province, Hebei Province has the most, with 21,160,000 yuan and 3,400,000 pounds. Shandong Province is second, with 15,370,000 yuan. Henan and Shanxi provinces each have 11-12 million yuan. In this high tide of developing North China, the development of its business still needs to be self-planned, so as not to have its rights encroached upon by others. As for all coal mines, the production and sales volume in the previous two years was: 13,203,47 tons produced in 1934 and 11,812,465 tons sold; 14,015,527 tons produced in 1935 and 13,640,735 tons sold.</p>
<p>Mine Production and Sales Volume</p>
<p>The production and sales volume of other mines are as follows: Iron mines produced 589,482 tons and sold 563,425 tons in 1934; produced 728,874 tons and sold 720,525 tons in 1935. Tin mines produced 2,204 tons and sold 1,564 tons in 1934; produced 2,272 tons and sold 1,822 tons in 1935. Placer gold produced 20 taels and sold 16.94 taels in 1934; produced 8.66 taels and sold 10.13 taels in 1935. Other metals such as lead, steel, antimony, and manganese produced 48,838 tons and sold 38,318 tons in 1934; produced 26,347 tons and sold 43,481 tons in 1935. Stone mines produced 64,496 tons and sold 20,623 tons in 1934; produced 28,249 tons and sold 18,582 tons in 1935. China's tin production is known for the Gejiu tin mine in Yunnan Province, with a capital of 2 million yuan. It produced 700 tons in 1934 and 600 tons in 1935, all of which were sold abroad. In Guangxi Province, there are 14 tin mines, with a total capital of more than 12 million yuan, most of which were recently established, which shows the province's efforts in developing the mining industry.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Meeting for the Income Tax Accounting Problem Research Association Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Elected Luo Qinghua and 20 Others as Preparatory Members</p>
<p>Leaders from various industries in Shanghai, in order to study income tax accounting issues, jointly initiated the organization of the Income Tax Accounting Problem Research Association. Yesterday afternoon, a founding meeting was held at the Bingzi Society on Yunnan Road, Jiujiang Road. More than 100 representatives from various industry associations attended. Chairman He Yuanming reported on the significance of the organization. Then, accountant Xia Sunhuan gave a speech on the importance of income tax accounting issues. Preparatory members were then elected. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Those who attended yesterday included representatives from the Chinese cigarette industry, dried goods industry, rubber industry, pickled mustard tuber industry, banking industry, chemical raw material industry, insurance industry, sandalwood and longan industry, local goods industry, noodle restaurant industry, rice and grain sales industry, electrical porcelain enamel industry, used wood industry, blue cloth dyeing industry, fishing vessel industry, restaurant industry, northern goods industry, Chinese medicine industry, shoe and leather nail last industry, insurance brokers, yarn and flower shop industry, firewood and charcoal shop industry, cosmetics industry, Chinese and foreign grocery industry, Western cigarette instrument and stationery industry, and other trade associations. Luo Qinghua, Yuan Hongjun, Li Qingfan, He Yuanming, Xie Zhongfu, Shen Weiting, Wang Lianfang, Ba Lingyun, Zhu Yangwu, Jin Chuxiang, Zhu Zhongqing, Gong Jingyan, Zhu Ya Kui, Jin Songtang, Qu Zhenhua, Zhu Pujiao, and more than 100 other people were publicly elected. He Yuanming was elected as chairman.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the formalities, Chairman He Yuanming first reported on the significance of initiating the organization, stating that various industry associations in Shanghai, in view of the fact that the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Implementation Rules of our country have been promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government on October 1st of last year, and have begun to be levied from the 1st of this month, all our companies, businesses, shops, factories, or individual capital of more than 2,000 yuan, and freelance professionals, etc., have the obligation to pay taxes. At the time when the new tax is being levied, people across the country are deeply concerned. However, it is feared that the people of the country cannot fully know the relevant laws and regulations, and the tax collection procedures are extremely cumbersome, the calculation methods are very complicated, and the accounting issues are particularly important. If there is any negligence, the gains and losses will be significant. However, up to now, there is no widespread research group on income tax accounting issues. Therefore, we have gathered colleagues from various industries to initiate the organization of the Income Tax Accounting Problem Research Association, with the aim of researching income and contributing opinions to the government authorities, while also enabling colleagues themselves to understand how to declare taxes. Countries such as the United States have been implementing income tax for a long time, but they still have amendments every year. At the beginning of our country's implementation, how to solve all the problems that arise needs to be jointly researched and discussed. Therefore, the association has the necessity of organization and the value of permanent existence. After He's report, accountant Xia Sunhuan delivered a speech on income tax accounting issues. The original words were very long and are omitted.</p>
<p>Election of Preparatory Members</p>
<p>Immediately, Luo Qinghua, He Yuanming, Shen Weiting, Zhao Erchang, Ba Lingyun, Wang Lianfang, Luo Zhenhua, Song Zhongqing, Sun Wuqi, Jin Chuxiang, Hong Songqing, Hu Shouqi, Zhu Yangwu, Li Qingfan, Wang Yucheng, Zhang Dafu, Yuan Hongwen, Xie Cufu, Zhu Ya Kui, Wang Jingdong, Fu Youming, and 21 other people were elected as preparatory members. It was also decided to hold the first preparatory meeting at 1:00 PM on the first of next month, which will be convened by He Mingjun.</p>

<h3>Continuation of Special Cash Guarantee Method</h3>
<p>The Bank Association publishes the full text</p>
<p>Summary of the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" 1. Type A Guarantee Deposit (calculated based on three times the monthly salary of the employee)</p>
<p>The principal will be fully refunded when the employee leaves the bank, and the interest will be calculated at an annual rate of 1.2%, with half paid to the employee and half used for public reserve funds.</p>
<p>2. Type B Guarantee Deposit (calculated based on 2% of the employee's monthly salary)</p>
<p>This guarantee deposit is a substitute for canceling the guarantor, which is equal to the guarantee fee for group credit. It is not necessary to refund this amount, but out of consideration for the employees, if there is no case of fraud, it can be fully recovered when leaving the bank, or the balance can be recovered after deduction of compensation.</p>
<p>3. Internal Guarantee Deposit: The Bank of China authorities have approved several million yuan, or the sum of half of the interest on Type A guarantee deposits and the full amount of Type B guarantee deposits. According to the above three public reserve funds for guarantee deposits, assuming that the total number of employees in the entire bank is 1,800 and the total annual salary is 1.6 million yuan, more than 100,000 yuan can be obtained in the first year. After five years, including interest, approximately 800,000 yuan can be obtained.</p>
<p>4. Joint and Several Penalties: After an employee fraud case occurs, other employees in the same branch who have one of the following circumstances shall be subject to joint and several penalties. The method shall be handled in accordance with the regulations on employee rewards and punishments.</p>
<p>I. Those who handle the job jointly or jointly with the same branch.</p>
<p>II. The direct supervisor of the same branch.</p>
<p>III. Other persons who are determined by the chairman and general manager to be subject to joint and several penalties.</p>
<p>5. Reward for Reporting: If an employee fraud is discovered or reported by the supervisor and other employees, so that the bank is not subject to or reduces losses, the discoverer or reporter shall be exempt from joint and several penalties, and the bank shall also reward them. The method shall be handled in accordance with the regulations on employee rewards and punishments. However, if the reported case is found to be untrue, it shall be punished by the authorities.</p>
<p>Plan of the "Special Cash Guarantee Method"</p>
<p>Employee Service Guarantee Rules</p>
<p>Article 1: The guarantee of employee service in this bank shall be handled in accordance with these rules.</p>
<p>The term "employee" in the preceding paragraph refers to all employees of the bank.</p>
<p>(Explanation) The second paragraph of this article is the definition of an employee, which clearly defines the scope and object of the implementation of these rules in order to prevent disputes in interpretation during implementation.</p>
<p>Article 2: Employees shall pay a Type A guarantee deposit in the amount of three times their monthly salary.</p>
<p>(Explanation) The characteristic of this method is to cancel the guarantor, so a considerable amount of cash must be paid to guarantee the amount. The amount is set at three times the monthly salary, which is not too high. In fact, there is no difficulty in making it easier than finding a guarantor, and part of the guarantee deposit and interest (see Article 5) can be returned in the future. It is beneficial to the employees themselves, with no loss. Assuming that the total annual salary is 1.6 million yuan, the bank will collect more than 400,000 yuan in guarantee deposits and obtain more than 24,000 yuan in annual interest, which will be used as part of the bank's reserve fund for preventing fraud losses. The guarantee can be said to be consolidated. (It is said that the British Midland Bank also has similar methods).</p>
<p>In order to consolidate the guarantee, the limit of Type A guarantee deposit can be stipulated to pay one year or half a year's salary, but it is feared that at this time of extreme social and economic distress, most employees with ordinary family backgrounds will find it difficult to raise funds, so after careful consideration of the situation, it is stipulated that it will be three times the monthly salary in order to be practical and easy to implement. If there is still concern that employees will find it difficult to raise funds, the previously deducted savings can be used, or deducted from the year-end bonus, or paid in installments.</p>
<p>Article 3: Employees shall not be assigned to a position until they have paid the total amount of Type A guarantee deposit as stipulated in the preceding article.</p>
<p>(Explanation) This article is exactly the same as the nature of Article 2 of the current guarantee rules. Since the strong rules require employees to comply, and the special cash guarantee system is a newly created method, in order to be effective, it must be strictly enforced, so they must wait until the Type A guarantee deposit is paid before they can be assigned to a position.</p>
<p>Article 4: The head office shall issue a Type A guarantee deposit passbook to the employee for the Type A guarantee deposit paid by the employee. This passbook shall not be transferred or mortgaged.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Issuing a guarantee deposit passbook is a certificate for the bank to receive the guarantee deposit. Prohibiting transfer or mortgage is to protect the consolidation of the guarantee deposit.</p>
<p>Article 5: The employee's Type A guarantee deposit shall be stored in a special account by the head office, and the interest shall be calculated at an annual rate of 1.2%, compounded every six months. However, the interest to which the employee is entitled shall be 0.6% per annum, and the remaining 0.6% shall be allocated to the employee guarantee reserve fund (see Article 11 of these rules).</p>
<p>(Explanation) Because half of the interest on the Type A guarantee deposit must be used for the employee reserve fund, the bank has specially increased the interest rate so that the employees will not suffer any losses. Both parties will be taken into consideration, and when the bank interest rate is reduced in the future, it can also be appropriately reduced to the stipulated amount. Half of the gold interest is allocated to the employee guarantee interest, so that the guarantee deposit paid by the employee will not be completely shelved. Half of the guarantee deposit is used to increase the strength of the guarantee.</p>
<p>Article 6: If there is an increase or decrease in the employee's salary grade or a change in position, the amount of the Type A guarantee deposit shall be increased or decreased separately in accordance with the provisions of Article 2.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Since the amount is stipulated to be three times the monthly salary, if there is any change in the employee's salary grade or position, the amount of the guarantee shall be increased or decreased accordingly. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Fire on Rue Pesson Last Night, Elderly Woman Burned to Death</h3>
<p>Old Woman's Sister Jumps from Building and is Seriously Injured, Niece Missing, Fire Spreads to Neighboring House</p>
<p>At around 7:00 pm last night, a fire broke out at No. 19, Lane Yu Kang, Rue Pesson, French Concession. An elderly woman from Ningbo was burned to death on the spot. The elderly woman's sister jumped from the building and was seriously injured. One niece of the elderly woman is missing. The fire also spread to the residents of No. 13 next door. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Ten Families Living in One House</p>
<p>No. 14, Lane Yu Kang, No. 19, Rue Pesson, French Concession, is a single two-story Shikumen building. The second landlord is a man from Ningbo, Chen Long, who works in the shipping industry. He is currently in Hong Kong and has not returned. The second landlord, in addition to living in the front building on the second floor, rents out all the other vacant houses, and even adds a third floor on the second floor, which is also rented to people. There are as many as ten families living there.</p>
<p>Old Woman Too Miserable</p>
<p>The front building on the added third floor is rented to Liu Quansheng (62 years old), a local resident. Liu used to run a paper shop, but is currently unemployed and suffers from a serious illness. He is staying in the hospital for treatment and has not yet been discharged. Liu had an affair with an elderly woman from Ningbo, Ms. Lu, 56 years old, nineteen years ago. According to her, the woman is from Shipu, Ningbo, and her mother's family name is Wang, named Tianxiang. She later married a man named Lu and had a son named Zhongkun, 32 years old, who is currently in prison in Ningbo for a crime and his sentence has not yet expired.</p>
<p>Fire Suddenly Breaks Out in the Living Room</p>
<p>The woman and Liu have been in an affair for as long as nineteen years, and have been living together. They have moved to Lane Yu Kang for several years. The woman's sister and niece, Xiao Xiang (23 years old), also live there. At 7:30 last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the living room of the house in the back. At the time, there were several tenants playing mahjong upstairs. When they heard the alarm and rushed down, the ladder had already been burned. Everyone fled separately, and the order was in chaos.</p>
<p>Buried in the Fire</p>
<p>At the time, the elderly woman, Ms. Lu, was in the room. When she heard the alarm, she planned to go downstairs to escape, but the woman was fat and had small feet, and was unable to escape. She was buried in the fire. The woman's sister also jumped from the building and was seriously injured. Fire brigade members first took the woman's sister to the hospital for treatment, and then tried to pull out Ms. Lu's body and carry it to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan branch to wait for a report to the Second Special District Court for examination. After the fire was extinguished, one of Ms. Lu's nieces, Xiao Xiang, was still missing.</p>
<p>Rumors About the Cause of the Fire</p>
<p>As for the cause of the fire, it is said that an eight-year-old girl living in the back living room was careless when burning a kerosene stove, causing the disaster. The police are currently investigating. In addition, the fire also spread to No. 13 next door, which was also completely destroyed.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Police Crack Down on Counterfeit Currency Gang</h3>
<p>Organized by Brazilian and Polish Immigrants, Japanese National Hasegawa Taken to Court for Interrogation</p>
<p>A certain Japanese national reported to the Hongkou Police that a Brazilian immigrant, Abete Erfang Denghuilimu Tuiji, a Polish immigrant, Airike Zhangdamenggu, and a Polish woman, Yaolaipaituole Nai, were planning to jointly counterfeit Central Bank banknotes. At 4:30 pm the day before yesterday, detectives from China, the West, and Japan were dispatched to No. 12, Lane 34, Haining Road to arrest the four men and women.</p>
<p>And Arrested Them Together</p>
<p>A steel printing press, an iron, two large and small glass bottles filled with liquid, and wooden boxes and clothes boxes were found in the residences of the men in No. 91 and No. 519, Huanlong Road, French Concession. In addition, there were also two Central Bank one-yuan banknotes, and their numbers were exactly the same. After careful examination, it was discovered that the last digit of the A ticket number was washed off with chemical water and filled in with the digit 3, so it was consistent with the</p>
<p>B Ticket Number</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the police escorted the captured criminals and various exhibits to the First Special District Court, where Judge Ye Shengchao opened the court for interrogation. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the case and requested that the criminals be punished in accordance with Article 329 of the Criminal Law. Then the witness, Japanese national Hasegawa Kiyoshi, appeared in court and testified about the details of contacting the defendant to counterfeit banknotes. He roughly said that he</p>
<p>Lives on Haining Road</p>
<p>No. 12, Lane 20. A few days ago, he met Huilimu Tuiji in the French Concession, who said that he was good at making counterfeit banknotes, and introduced the other defendants to meet. He also took out a Central Bank one-yuan banknote, one of which had its number altered. The people then incited him to cooperate and asked him to raise 5,000 yuan to start counterfeiting. Because he had little money, he discussed this plan with his</p>
<p>Wealthy</p>
<p>Friends, and agreed to meet with the defendants at No. 12, Lane 24, Haining Road at 4:30 pm yesterday afternoon. He reported to the police at the same time and was arrested together. However, after being questioned in court, all four defendants confessed that they were using the name of making counterfeit banknotes to lure the Japanese national's money, saying that the Japanese had recently been selling heroin and other drugs in the French Concession to poison the people. One day, at No. 95 of a certain place</p>
<p>In the Swallow's Nest</p>
<p>He met Hasegawa Kiyoshi who came to sell heroin. They were moved and used the excuse that they could make counterfeit banknotes to lure him into cooperation, so as to swindle money from him. In fact, they were not real counterfeiters, so all the objects were temporarily prepared, etc. Judge Ye verified the confession and said that the case still needed to be investigated, and ordered the defendants to be detained and interrogated again next Monday.</p>
<p>Reported in the Newspaper</p>
<p>The Japanese-language Daily News said that since the Shanghai Incident, counterfeit banknotes have been rampant in the streets, and victims have been heard one after another.

In addition to escorting the four foreigners to the Special District Court, Hasegawa was detained at the Japanese Consulate General.</p>

In order to cultivate the people's patriotic enthusiasm, the following procedure can be added to the opening of each movie theater in the future, depending on the situation of the film being shown on that day: 1. Party and National Flag, 2. Premier's Image, 3. National Government Chairman's Image, 4.

<h3>The Ye FuKang Case: Court Detains Wang Hanqing</h3>
<p>Witness Hu Jinkun's Testimony: The Judge Finds It Too Bizarre</p>
<p>Ye FuKang, a former judge of the Shanghai Local Court and a lawyer, was accused by Wang Han卿 in the Ministry of Justice of embezzling huge sums of money under the guise of defense. The case was handed over to Tang Ruxiu, a prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court, for investigation and prosecution. After repeated trials in the criminal court, Wang Hanxiang suddenly requested withdrawal during the trial, admitting to making false accusations. Considering the matter unusual, the court ordered Wang to appear, but he avoided doing so, making it impossible to interrogate and judge. Yesterday, Judge Lu continued the trial, with witness Hu Jinkun appearing in court. The judge asked: "You said last time that lawyer Gu Ao used a 20,000-yuan receipt as a guarantee for Ye FuKang's settlement, but Gu said in court that there was no such thing." Hu replied: "The settlement negotiations were at Gu's place, and Gu came to the Da Yi apartment a second time to discuss it." The judge asked: "Why haven't you found Wang Hanxiang as you were instructed?" Hu replied: "I went to Hankou on November 27th and ran into Wang at Mao Yongji Inn in Dazhimen on the 28th. I immediately asked him how his lawsuit with Ye FuKang was going and suggested that he come to Shanghai with me. He said that his wife, Wang Zhangshi, was not dead, but he was divorced from Wang. As for the details of the case, Wang needed to ask his scribe to inquire with Wang Zhangshi before coming to Shanghai. We agreed to go to Shanghai together on the 30th, but unexpectedly, when I went on the 29th, Wang Hanxiang avoided meeting me again. I returned to Shanghai on January 12th and don't know if the withdrawal papers were filed." The judge asked Wang Fuyou about Wang Zhangshi's whereabouts. Wang replied that he didn't know. The judge said: "What you're saying is too bizarre. Wang Hanxiang sent a withdrawal paper immediately after you arrived in Hankou. Weren't you just going to get this paper?" Wang replied: "I don't know anything about it." The court adjourned the case for another hearing and sent a letter to Hankou to request assistance in interrogating Wang.</p>
<h3>The Zheng YiZhi Family Estate Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The Property Is Managed by Younger Brothers; Concubine Sues the Court for Liquidation</p>
<p>Zheng 鎰zhi from Chaozhou started his career by operating special businesses, accumulating considerable wealth, not less than a million. He married a woman from his hometown, Zhou, who gave birth to a son named Guo Kai, currently over twenty years old. At the time, he also took Zhang Shuyun, a woman from Shanghai, as a concubine, who also gave birth to a son and a daughter. The son's name is Guo Xiao, currently twelve years old, and the daughter Yue Zhen, currently fifteen years old. Zheng 鎰zhi died of illness in the winter of 1924. At that time, the children were still young, so he entrusted all his property to his brothers Zheng Qiting, Zheng 鎰zhi, Zheng Zuo, and Zheng Jian for joint management. After Zheng Qiting and others accepted the will, they determined that Liu would pay Zhang Shuyun and her children 300 yuan per month for living expenses, to be withdrawn by voucher. Later, it was increased to 4,000 yuan per year. Recently, Zhang Shuyun, seeing that her children had grown up, claimed that her uncles and others had not reported any accounts for the property they had been managing for more than ten years. Therefore, she asked Zheng Zhan Ting and others to hand over the accounts for liquidation. However, Zheng and others suddenly claimed that they had not managed Zheng 鎰zhi's property. Zhang had no choice but to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, together with her children, through lawyer Du Xi against Zheng Qiting, Zheng Jian, Zheng Zuo, Zheng Hui, Zheng Zhou, and Zheng Guo Kai, demanding the handover and liquidation of accounts. The court accepted the case, and yesterday, Judge Luo Can opened the Civil Fourth Court for interrogation. Zheng Zhou and Zheng Guo Kai were absent, while the remaining defendants also retained lawyers to appear in court. They denied managing the inheritance. However, the plaintiff's lawyer presented evidence that the defendants were still managing Zheng 鎰zhi's property in Leyu Lane. After Judge Luo's interrogation, he ordered the case to be adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Passenger Smoking in a Tramway Discovered</h3>
<p>Interrogation and Punishment</p>
<p>On the 19th of this month, at 8:55 PM, four detectives from the 𣓾Shupu Police Station were patrolling in their jurisdiction. At the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Songpan Road, they saw an Eight-Road tramway passing by and boarded it for a search. As a result, they found five packs of opium on Zhu A, a passenger from Tongzhou. They took him back to the police station. Under investigation, it was learned that Zhu A was a servant of Lu Juchen, the owner of the World Rubber Factory at No. 16 Hejian Road, who was from Ningbo. The opium was purchased on Lu's instructions. Therefore, Chinese detective Shen Gaozhou and others went to search and seized a opium pipe, a opium lamp, opium, and other opium smoking implements. Lu Juchen and his wife, Lu Li, were arrested. The police station lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, prosecuted them in the First Special District Court in accordance with the Opium Suppression Regulations.

<h3>Shi Xiangyun's Father Dies; His Concubine Gives Birth to Triplets</h3>
<p>Xiangzhen's Brother Believes It Dishonors the Family and Files a Lawsuit with the Court to Dissolve the Relationship</p>
<p>Shi Xiangyun, a veteran female Suzhou opera singer, has performed at the Great World, New World, and other amusement venues in this city, and is quite famous for singing Kunqu opera. She lives at No. 46 Tongkang Lane, opposite the Slaughterhouse in the French Concession. Recently, Shi Xiangyun was about to marry someone surnamed Lin, and the wedding preparations were underway, but the performances were suspended and she stayed at home. Her brother, Shi Xiaoyun, also known as Shi Qingtang, is in a troupe with a woman named Wu Lanying and broadcasts Suzhou opera on various radio stations.</p>
<p>Singing Suzhou Opera</p>
<p>He lives with his sister Xiangyun in the same place. Shi's father, Shi Xikang, is deceased. During his lifetime, he was over sixty years old when he took a woman named Leng as a concubine more than ten years ago. Leng is thirty-one years old this year. After giving birth, she had a daughter named Lanbin, who is twelve years old this year. Since entering the Shi family, Leng has also learned to sing Suzhou opera. After mastering the art, she took the stage name Shi Feixia and performed in the same troupe as Shi Xiangyun and others, also singing Kunqu opera.</p>
<p>Important Supporting Role</p>
<p>After Shi Xikang died of illness last spring, Leng suddenly changed her mind and behaved improperly. She became pregnant and gave birth earlier this month. She went to the Zhongde Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital for delivery. Unexpectedly, she gave birth to triplets, one male and two female, but two died and one survived. Leng rented a residence at No. 47 Fuzhifang in Changxing Lane, Belle Road, after completing her confinement. Shi Qingtang, Shi Xiangyun's brother, believes that the son</p>
<p>Born to Leng</p>
<p>Is not a descendant of the Shi family and that it is a disgrace to the family and affects the reputation. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special District against Shi Leng Feixia and her son to dissolve the relationship. The court responded to the lawsuit, and Judge Liao Yuan visited the Seventh Civil Court yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to hear the case. The defendant was absent. According to the lawyer representing the district's notification, "Our lawyer has learned that the defendant in this case has appointed a lawyer to represent them and should request an adjournment for another hearing," etc. After reviewing the words in court, it was ruled that the hearing would be adjourned to February 4 for another hearing.</p>

Wang's wife, Yang, thirty-six years old, who was nearly three months pregnant, tried to mediate, but Wang Xiangfa kicked her in the abdomen. She fell to the ground in pain and cried for help. Detective Li Changchao heard the alarm and arrived, and after questioning, arrested him and took him to the Qianglin Road Police Station for detention.

Yesterday morning, the police station sent Wang Xiangfa to the First Special District Court. The Public Works Bureau lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the situation, stating that the defendant denied kicking Wang Yang in the abdomen with his foot at the police station, but Wang Dangqing, his wife, and witness Lin Jiazheng all pointed out that the defendant did kick her in the abdomen at the time. Wang Yang is unable to appear in court due to being in the hospital, and the fetus has been brought to the court. Please postpone the hearing. Wang Dangqing and Lin Jiazheng testified about the incident, and when questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive.

<p>Boat Owner and Crew Not Lost</p>
<p>At 11:50 AM yesterday, three rows of fishing boats were moored at the northern end of the fish market wharf. The northernmost row was moored with three fresh fish boats. At that time, the tide was rising very rapidly, and the anchors of the three fresh fish boats were vibrated and broken. At the same time, the Sixth Municipal Ferry was moored at the wharf and was loading and unloading passengers. The fish boats drifted to the side of the ferry. The ferry workers helped to hook up Municipal Certificates No. 50117 and 70216 to the side of the ferry. Only one fresh fish boat, No. 52996, could not be secured and was washed away by the tide, crashing into other fishing boats moored at the southern part of the wharf, causing it to capsize and sink. The masts of the hit fishing boat were slightly damaged. The sunken ship was subsequently recovered a mile away, with an estimated loss of 40 loads of carp.

<h3>Public Works Bureau Road Workers Held a Representative Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Describing Seven Reasons and Arguing Reasonably; Issued a Declaration Appealing to All Sectors for Assistance</p>
<p>The Great Gongshe reports that the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession, in order to implement cost savings, will lay off nine-tenths of the Chinese road workers, which will leave more than 1,200 workers in the district unemployed. The public is panicked. In addition to submitting petitions to various parties the day before yesterday, a general representative meeting was convened yesterday afternoon. Many resolutions were discussed and a declaration was issued. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Representative Meeting: Over a hundred road worker representatives from the Public Works Bureau, including Liu Huanwen, Wang Shuangfang, and Huan Buying, held a meeting at 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Liu Huanwen was elected as chairman and the ceremony was performed. The chairman reported on the reduction of government personnel by the Public Works Department. All workers requested to organize a mutual aid association. The chairman then submitted it for discussion. The following motions are recorded: ㊀ How should road workers defend themselves against the sudden layoff by the Public Works Bureau? It was resolved: (A) To organize the Shanghai Public Concession Road Workers Mutual Aid Association, (B) To issue a declaration, (C) To petition and appeal to party and government agencies and various groups, (D) To send a letter to the Public Works Bureau requesting them to withdraw their order, (E) To pass the declaration and draft, (F) To appoint Liu Shuowen and 14 others as executive committee members. ㊁ How should we advocate for the Public Works Bureau to withdraw their order? It was resolved: To argue reasonably based on the following seven reasons: 1. For government staff reduction, senior staff with monthly salaries of thousands or hundreds of dollars should be reduced. 2. The tightening of the social economy is actually due to the increase in the unemployed population. 3. Recently, the road lines have been lengthened and the road surfaces have been widened, increasing the amount of work. 4. The number of vehicles is increasing daily, and the roads are easily damaged and require more repairs. 5. The original workers have tasted the wind and rain and braved gunfire during the January 28th Incident, risking their lives for the cause. 6. Recently, wages in various industries have increased, but road workers have not requested an increase in wages. 7. Frequent recruitment of workers has many malpractices and is not easy to assemble at once. ㊁ How should assistance be provided if laid off before the reorganization plan is resolved? It was resolved: If one person is laid off, all work will be stopped. The meeting adjourned at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>Declaration: I, a road worker serving in the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau for decades, have been tasting the wind and rain, working diligently, morning and night, paving roads, to achieve today's prosperity in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, we have suddenly suffered a complete elimination by the Bureau. Looking back on the past, we cannot overcome our indignation. Considering the future, we cannot overcome our sadness. The Bureau has stubbornly adhered to its nature, and the workers have no effect from their appeals. We have no choice but to rise up with powerful organizations and resolutely oppose the Bureau's unreasonable oppression. We hope that all sectors will advance and teach us, not let us become displaced. It is a great fortune. According to the Bureau's excuse, laying off workers is due to reducing expenditures. However, in reality, the salaries of over a thousand road workers are not as much as the benefits of nearly ten senior foreign employees of the Bureau. If we really want to reduce expenditures, we should also reduce the generous salaries of senior foreign employees. Why must we make thousands of workers unemployed and increase social unrest? Therefore, making it difficult for us low-level Chinese workers is unreasonable in one way. As far as road administration is concerned, the road lines are gradually lengthening, the road surfaces are gradually widening, and the railway engineering is becoming more and more complicated due to the increase in vehicles. It seems that only road workers should be added, but why is there a layoff? It is really unreasonable in two ways. In view of the recent situation of workers in various industries requesting wage increases, but our road workers are still working as usual, the people who are safe, self-conscious, and have no faults are still suffering from unemployment. This is unreasonable in three ways. During the January 28th Shanghai War, all the defense projects were completed by our road workers braving the gunfire. The injured and the dead are a matter of fact. Now, with a cruel heart, those who are loyal to their duties and have made contributions have not been given any consideration. This is unreasonable in four ways. In short, the Bureau's arbitrary layoff of our road workers is unreasonable and is based on the concept of contempt for our Chinese people. When we are recruited for work, we are now ordered to leave, and we believe that we are of no importance and helpless. But we workers will never degrade our personality or harm the national system. We must unite and argue reasonably. We will not give up until we achieve fair treatment and a reasonable solution. I hereby post my sincerity and hope that the public will understand.</p>

The Executive Committee of the Commission, considering Mr. Baker's enthusiasm for famine relief and his familiarity with the Commission's affairs, unanimously invited him to assume the position of General Secretary to succeed Mr. Zhang. Mr. Baker also agreed to take on this responsibility and originally planned to arrive in China at the beginning of this month. However, the American seamen's strike has not been resolved for a long time, and the voyage was interrupted, making it impossible to start the journey, which caused delays. It is now heard that he departed from Seattle on the 12th of this month, detoured through Japan, changed to the Shanghai Maru liner to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive on the 29th.</p>

<h3>Japan's Leap Forward</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>In neighboring Japan, the current 70th session of the Diet has stirred up a great storm. The result was the resignation of the cabinet. The military, as the main force behind this change, stated in their published opinions on politics that the future cabinet must be able to correctly recognize the times to facilitate Japan's leap forward. We cannot but pay attention to the "leap forward" of our friendly neighbor.</p>
<p>When it comes to the history of Japan's modern leap forward, some aspects certainly make people have to admire it. With the Sino-Japanese War, plus the Russo-Japanese War, and the opportunity of the European War from 1914 to 1918, Japan developed at a rapid pace. Today, it also has another "Manchurian Utopia," with "30 million people, without suffering or worry," as its huge appendage. Looking at the current situation, it has developed to the point where it can no longer develop. However, with this consistent military victory-driven leap forward, it has also attracted more enemies at home and abroad. For example, domestically, it has sacrificed the people's minimum living requirements to maintain its excessive military budget, which is more than that of other countries. Abroad, not to mention the United States and the Soviet Union, even Britain, which has always been friendly before and after the European War, also feels uncomfortable with it. More importantly, whether China will remain silent for a long time is an even bigger problem, causing Japan, in the midst of its leap forward, to worry day and night and be unable to sleep soundly. All of this shows that along with Japan's rapid leap forward, on the other hand, are terrible domestic and foreign threats. This situation, of course, cannot make Japan, which is in the midst of its leap forward, retreat halfway. The only way is to seek even more leap forward. There is a Chinese saying that goes, "If you don't do it, don't do it; if you do it, do it thoroughly." Another saying goes, "It's hard to get off a tiger's back." The only way is to drive the tiger to devour people. The Japanese military's reason for wanting even more leap forward at a time when Japan has nothing more to leap forward is for this reason.</p>
<p>Putting aside ethnic hatred, from a cultural point of view, Japan's rapid progress in recent centuries cannot but make us admire it. It is also for this reason that we are very sorry for the Western culture that Japan has accepted in recent years, given that Japan has taken a path of having to leap forward even further and being unable to get off a tiger's back in the past ten years or so. In the past, Japan accepted foreign culture, and it was considered one of the most active and advanced countries in the world. Many of our people indirectly inherited Western culture from Japanese culture. But now, as Mr. Zhou Zuoren said, "There is only militarization to speak of." Those who want Japan to leap forward into military adventure do not feel that it is sad, but from the standpoint of pure culture, hopeful Japanese thinkers and cultural workers cannot but regard it as a painful thing.</p>
<p>We are very worried about the extremely dangerous future of the friendly neighbor's national policy, which is being led by military adventurism. However, this worry must first be directed at ourselves. Looking at Japan's leap forward in the future, there will be no other path. If there is, it is our vast divine land. Here, galloping horses and wielding spears are enough for the friendly neighbor's army to show its power. Come on, other places are full of thorns, but this is the only smooth road! However, whether it can be smooth to the end, please be careful first, and don't "an old woman of sixty binding a child," or you will regret it too late!</p>
<h3>Kowloon City</h3>
<p>— Yu Lu</p>
<p>From Hong Kong, taking a ferry to Yau Ma Tei or Tsim Sha Tsui, you can transfer to a "bus" to Kowloon City.</p>
<p>People who come to Hong Kong for sightseeing will probably always hear locals introducing this place:</p>
<p>"Let's go see the Sung Wong Toi! Also, don't forget to eat wontons in Kowloon City, which are very famous. Moreover, there are also the oil vegetables or white flower kale that have just been picked from the fields, which are even more delicious...</p>
<p>Cantonese people love to eat, and scenic spots often start with "eating." Saying this, people will naturally be moved. Because in Guangzhou, perhaps tourists will still miss the fresh vegetables from the fields in Xiaobei and Shahe. Therefore, as long as you have heard this introduction, you will always want to go to such a place to play for a while. So, without any difficulties, as long as you have money, you can set off.</p>
<p>On the bus, we crossed the road and came to the suburbs. Strangers are most likely to mistake Kowloon Tong for Kowloon City, because the names are so similar. However, as long as you are a humble tourist, the bus ticket seller is often the best guide.</p>
<p>Along the way, we saw the yellow mud hills that were being mined, and also saw the fields. Thus, we were heading towards Kowloon City.</p>
<p>When the bus arrived at the station, a gentle, evergreen field stretched across the front. The first thing that caught our eye was often the very large advertisement sign made of leather for the ×× Airport. It tells ordinary Chinese people that there is a "Royal" airport there, and the airport has an aviation school, as long as you have money, the certificate signed by the Royal can be obtained after the "training period is over"—but, you must understand: Kowloon City is not a concession.</p>
<p>After getting off the bus, the pleasant wind of the fields will give you a fresh smell. For the nose and respiratory organs that have been smoked by the coal smoke of the city, this will give you a different and indescribably comfortable compensation. Thatched cottages and simple houses are also not seen in this gorgeous Hong Kong. In a vulgar word, this is completely "Chinese flavor" (Note). Precisely because of this, perhaps the pleasure it gives people will exceed everything in this island port.</p>
<p>——Isn't this just the countryside?</p>
<p>Yes. It is the countryside, a territory coveted by others. It, this countryside that is a bit reminiscent of paradise, is now, just because it is close to Hong Kong and the Kowloon Peninsula, which are concessions, also suffering from the general fate of our country——being bullied and invaded.</p>
<p>However, casual passers-by will not think of these things, they will just conveniently ask people: Where is the place to eat?</p>
<p>The place to eat is a small village tea house-like thatched cottage. The front door can be seen from the back door. It is very small, and the equipment is also very simple. There are several wooden tables and some haphazard benches. There is no boasting advertisement, and even the signboard is omitted. However, what is enough to call people is the vegetable field surrounding the small shop on three sides. The rapeseed flowers in the field are blooming vigorously, and the appearance is already tempting enough. On the other side is the front door, facing the main road; the back door leads to a field ridge, and if you keep walking, there is another "old shop."</p>
<p>When guests arrive, the waiter (server) greets them with a smile. The food here is very simple, only fried wontons, shrimp fried noodles, wonton noodles, and chop suey. But just these few styles are enough to satisfy people. In hot weather, because there are many people resting in Hong Kong, their business is most prosperous. Sometimes, when the guests are happy, the tables and chairs can also be placed outside, even on the field ridges. Although it is not very cold in winter, the wind is not conducive to business, so they call this time "slack season."</p>
<p>Sometimes, some nosy guests will ask them about the forced relocation (Note), and they are very optimistic——</p>
<p>"We have been fighting this lawsuit for several years, they dare not do anything. We are united, are we afraid of them?"</p>
<p>Kowloon City, this is a primitive, simple, paradise-like countryside!</p>
<p>(Note) Royal—a name like this is most prestigious in this bird port. Some higher-class Chinese people, I don't know if there is so-called "repression" at work, always disdainfully say that everything dirty and immoral is "Chinese flavor."</p>
<p>(Note) Kowloon City, if we have been reading newspapers recently, I believe this name is definitely not unfamiliar. The rulers of the Kowloon Peninsula are ambitiously trying to deceive and expel the villagers in the surrounding area.</p>

<h3>Runaway Coolies</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>——Miscellaneous Mountain Travels</p>
<p>To have coolies run away halfway is a particularly unlucky thing, and in the coolie trade, there is some taboo about this.</p>
<p>Eating lunch... no, one can’t say it like that. The so-called “lunch” is actually long past the time. Originally, on mountain roads, eating cannot adhere to a fixed schedule. "Rushing to the tip and landing at an inn," one can feed one’s belly anywhere, as long as one is hungry. It means to open up your stomach as much as possible and stuff it! Passing by everything that can make you bloated to death, yet the cost is unexpectedly cheap.</p>
<p>It was time to get up again, and there was another flurry of activity. According to the rules, whatever someone carried or shouldered, once it was assigned, there would rarely be changes except in cases of necessity. The coolies did not need to be assigned partners each time. Thus, when about to depart, they would search for their partners without needing to be urged. However, today was a bit unusual. Partners shouldered their goods, one load after another, and walked away. In the end, four loads were left and no one could lift them. They searched around, and then shouted from the beginning to the end of the street, but where was any trace of them?</p>
<p>Young Zhang, the foreman, shouted himself hoarse and walked back angrily, veins appearing bloodshot in his eyes, the blood vessels on his forehead throbbing, muttering to himself: "Four ran away, those sons of turtles!" Looking back, the four remaining partners still stood there blankly. Time was passing, and of course they couldn’t stay there for long. The first group had already started climbing the mountainside in front, winding along slowly like ants.</p>
<p>No matter how one looked at it, the old coolie leader could no longer bear the heavy burden of shoulder carrying. What about the two coolie leaders, Zhang and Li? They tacitly assumed the roles of two missing coolies, but there were still two short, so it was necessary to find others.</p>
<p>After leaving Zhengzhi Street, coolie Zhang was still muttering: "Good, you sons of turtles, making me suffer to death. If I run into you, I'll beat you to a pulp!" Walking on the rugged road, his anger still hadn't completely dissipated. At the same time, because he was bearing the responsibility of leading the way, if there was a pool of water on the side of the mountain, or a branch on the side of the road, he had to shout like the other coolies!</p>
<p>——A sea of water ahead!——</p>
<p>——Green reeds on the left!…</p>
<p>Following, the partners in the rear would respond—</p>
<p>——Open the mirror to take a photo!</p>
<p>——Lift the pole over the big peak!…</p>
<p>Today, the signs of rain didn't seem to lessen. The mountains that looked not far away, like “seeing a mountain and thinking you can run to it,” were tightly covered by dark clouds. The mountain haze and dark clouds gradually merged together, and the valley in the encirclement was even darker. The water in the stream was particularly rapid these past few days. Usually, after several impacts and filtrations, it was so clear that one could see the fish swimming at the bottom, but now, it was so murky yellow that one couldn't see anything at all. The reason was said to be due to flash floods in the mountains ahead.</p>
<p>According to the usual practice of traveling, when passing Huangyazi, one should actually make another quick stop, nibbling on a couple of ears of fresh corn that just came out of the pot, but the weather was indeed too bad. The fine rain was already falling diagonally. Dropping by the inn and rushing on the road, this thought hung in their hearts. They raised the oilcloth and hurried on the distant journey. Ahead, the clouds pressing down on the mountain peaks were even lower.</p>
<p>When they reached the "Tea Pavilion" at the top of the mountain, the rain was heavy. The quilts in the sedan chairs were already half-wet. After calculating, there were still about ten *li* to the next inn. It looked like the weather would hinder their progress. After discussing, they decided to temporarily stay overnight at the Tea Pavilion. Speaking of the Tea Pavilion, it was really not a place for lodging. There were only six or seven rooms for mountain product businesses in total. In the tea pavilion on the left, there was a large tea vat, with three or four chipped cups hanging outside. Because the distance between the two stops was relatively far, and this was also a passageway up the mountain, “going up the mountain” always made people thirsty in hot weather. Thus, the Tea Pavilion compensated for this need.</p>
<p>After repeatedly negotiating with the homeowner, they finally agreed, leaving some empty spaces in each room for us. Sitting on long wooden benches under the grass shed, we inquired about the local customs here. Suddenly, a burst of shouts rose from the room, so violent, stern, and mixed with the sound of punches. We were shocked and rushed in hastily. Ah! What could we say? Two runaway coolies were comfortably lying in bed smoking, and Zhang, the coolie leader who had been grumbling all the way, grabbed them and started beating them without saying a word. The old coolie leader was cursing, and many people were shouting. Later, the result of the mediation was that the two of them would still return to the group, and when it was time to eat at the county town, they would treat the coolie leaders to several *liang* of yellow wine as compensation. That was how the matter was resolved.</p>
<p>Unable to sleep at night, I listened quietly to the sound of the mountain streams and the crisp sound of rain hitting the thatched shed.</p>
<h3>A Novel School for Difficult Children in England</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>In the town of East Sutton, England, there is an old 17th-century mansion where a young psychologist, Mr. Shao, has established a special school. It is exclusively dedicated to a kind of psychological education experiment for stubborn and difficult children. The entire school only has over twenty students. The youngest is only five years old, and the oldest is seventeen years old. Half of them were sent there because their parents and teachers believed that they were impossible to discipline, because these children vehemently opposed ordinary rules. The other half had also been taught at various psychological guidance centers but their bad habits could not be corrected. Only then were they sent to Mr. Shao for guidance. They all suffer from various neurological disorders, including a few who suffer from kleptomania.</p>
<p>Mr. Shao ordered the students to establish a "Police Court" and to formulate their own laws and enforce them themselves. The authority of the school staff is not greater than that of the students. The student chairman of the court can also sue and punish the staff. The staff cannot impose corporal punishment on the students, but in the event of extremely serious incidents, they can also use force against the students. When the court opens a case, after the witnesses have finished their testimony, the students listening to the trial raise their hands to decide whether the defendant is guilty. If the defendant does not comply with the court's judgment, he can be sued again, but the second punishment will be more severe than the first, and he can also be deprived of his rights. The greatest punishment is not to allow him to participate in any social life in the school. Those who have committed offenses may be ordered to compensate for the loss, which is deducted from their pocket money. If a large amount of money is stolen, after a thorough investigation, the offender's personal belongings may be auctioned off to compensate, or he may be fined to work on campus, paid at a rate of two pence per hour. A local farmer once came to the school to complain that several children were chasing his sheep for fun. As a result, the weekly meeting of students and staff passed a law prohibiting scaring sheep. One child violated this law, and the court fined him one penny. One student put nearly a hundred small fish in a glass bottle, and many died from overcrowding. After another student reported it, a law was passed requiring students to obtain a license for raising fish or other pets, with a license fee of half a penny each. Their every move is restricted by the group. For example, if a student wants to ride a bicycle, he must first be tested in driving on the road in front of two students. Only after passing the test will he be issued a license to ride a bicycle outside.</p>
<p>Mr. Shao initially allowed students to not attend classes at school if they did not want to. They could get up whenever they wanted and go out whenever they wanted. But after Mr. Shao's guidance, they surprisingly did not want to enjoy this excessive freedom. They are now able to abide by the new system and develop according to routine. According to Mr. Shao, these students have the hope of becoming good citizens in the future.</p>

<h3>Aftersounds</h3>
<p>To Yuanchang Radio Station: Upon investigating the article published in Shenbao on the 5th regarding our company falsely using your name, your station has completely misunderstood. It can also be said that our company's staff were careless. Because our company had employees who contacted your station, the program schedule was issued before reaching a proper agreement. This point is where our company is very sorry to your radio station. We sincerely request your forgiveness and hereby issue a statement of apology. Sincerely, Lido Amateur Singing Society</p>
<p>We, the common people, have always not paid attention to dental health, therefore toothaches are most common. Hwa-Shing Broadcasting Station, recognizing this, has specially invited Dr. Zhou Quanzhao, Doctor of Dental Medicine, to explain the principles of dental medicine and oral hygiene every day from 8:15 am to 9:00 am starting from the first day of next month (frequency 1260). As this concerns physical health, it is hoped that all listeners will pay special attention.</p>

<h3>Grand Theater Screens "The Great Detective Donner"</h3>
<p>New Work by Superstar William Powell</p>
<p>Starting today, the Grand Theater will screen Warner Brothers' glamorous detective blockbuster "The Great Detective Donner" (Private Detective 62). The film stars the great William Powell and features the beautiful actress Margaret Lindsay. The film tells the story of an international detective who retires to become a private detective and is ordered by the private detective agency to investigate the secrets of a romantic girl. As a result, he falls in love with the girl and discovers that the detective agency he serves is actually a secret organization of villains. The plot is full of twists and turns and is very interesting. William Powell plays the great detective Donner in the film and his acting skills are excellent, adding a lot of color to the film.</p>
<h3>Behind-the-Scenes at Lianhua Studio</h3>
<p>In "A Match Made in Heaven," Lan Gen has the most shots, with a total of 500 shots in the whole play, while Han Zhan has more than 350.</p>
<p>In "A Pearl Lost in the Sea of People," materials from a guide agency are needed. Director Zhu Shilin and actress Li Lili are both laymen in this field. They once asked the experienced veterans of the main factory and benefited a lot.</p>
<p>The cinematographer of "Spring Comes to the World" is Huang Shaofen. His artistry is originally good, especially when he is filming Yan Yan, which makes him even more excited, so he makes Yan Yan even more beautiful.</p>
<p>When Yin Xiucen has nothing to do, he often likes to go to the recording room to eavesdrop on the work of the studio. It is said that he only hears the sound but does not see the person, like listening to ventriloquism, and its wonder cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>Han Lan'gen looks as thin as a salamander, but his appetite is double that of others. Sometimes he can eat eight bowls in one meal—believe it or not.</p>
<p>Hong Jingling used to play roles like counselors and doctors, so he has the nickname of a standard counselor.</p>
<h3>Lan Ping as Kadlina in "The Thunderstorm"</h3>
<h3>Cathay Screens "Spring on a Yacht"</h3>
<p>A light and fluent romantic comedy</p>
<p>The wide-mouthed, funny actress Martha Raye and the petite, exquisite actress Shirley Ross are both the protagonists of "Kaleidoscope." They also co-starred in a romantic, funny singing blockbuster "Spring on a Yacht" (Hideaway Girl), which opens today at the Cathay Grand Theatre. The film tells the story of a young girl who, because she is forced to marry a boor, is unwilling and tries to escape at the wedding. At that time, another woman steals the boor's precious jewels, but everyone suspects that the girl stole them. So they report to the police to investigate. In order to avoid attracting attention, the girl temporarily pretends to be someone else's bride and hides on a yacht, and all kinds of unexpected things happen constantly. The film is not only full of laughs but also has many opera scenes.</p>
<h3>Minxin News</h3>
<p>After "The Gate of Flesh and Spirit" was accompanied by music, it was largely pre-screened in theaters. The excellence of the results and the touching emotions made the viewers present praise it incessantly. This kind of realistic story can happen in any Chinese family, and it can be so tense, tragic, intense, and moving, which is something that no other film has ever achieved.</p>
<p>"New Humanity" is currently shooting a scene in Zhao Jiaxiang's residence. Hu Rong has taken off his Western suit and leather shoes and put on cloth shoes and a long robe, and he also has a round-topped hat on his head.</p>
<p>"Mysterious Female Detective," directed by Ren Pengnian and starring Wu Lizhu, is in preparation for filming.</p>
<p>Jin Qingyu is now focusing on revising the script of "Fratricide" so that he can focus on directing work during production and avoid the trouble of having to take care of everything.</p>
<p>Tian Han once sent Minxin a new script called "The Blacksmith Shop"</p>
<p>A total of twenty or thirty people participated in the music accompaniment work for "The Gate of Flesh and Spirit." Every time they worked until late at night, they would eat Cantonese pot noodles for supper, which was very interesting.</p>
<p>Recently, in addition to Lin Chuchu, Hu Rong, Wang Guilin, Xu Kunwu, and Chen Renzhi acting in "New Humanity," Li Kengdi's younger brother Li Xi has also been on camera. His cleverness is just like Li Keng in the silent "Humanity" of that year.</p>
<h3>Chen Yumei Stars in Taiping Flower</h3>
<p>The famous novelist Zhang Henshui has many works. "The Story of Laughter and Tears" and "Happy Enemies" have been adapted for the screen successively. Now, his famous book "Taiping Flower" will also be made into a film by Tianyi Company.</p>
<p>"Taiping Flower" is named Taiping, but it is actually not peaceful, just like the movie "All Quiet on the Western Front" says it is quiet, but in fact, there is a big war going on. Therefore, "Taiping Flower" is a great work reflecting the current era.</p>
<p>Under Tianyi's active preparation, "Taiping Flower" will be filmed soon, starring Chen Yumei, and jointly directed by Shao Zuiweng, Wen Yimin, and Zuo Ming. This is undoubtedly a blockbuster film that will cause a sensation in the film industry.</p>

<h3>Completion of the Zhongzheng Bridge</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Zhongzheng Grand Iron Bridge spans the Gan River, connecting Niuhang Station and Nanchang. The main bridge has 28 spans, the approach bridge has 27 spans, and the total length is 3,530 feet. Construction began in December of the 23rd year of the Republic of China and was completed on New Year's Day of this year. A traffic opening ceremony was held. Named Zhongzheng in memory of Chairman Chiang's merits in suppressing bandits in Jiangxi. After the completion of the bridge, the Zhegan, Nanxun, and Ganxiang three railways can be connected; the highways of the eight provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, and Fujian can be linked. Its benefits to national defense, economic, transportation, and cultural aspects are enormous.</p>
