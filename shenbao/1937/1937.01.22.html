<p>時評</p>
<h3>美國羅斯福總統就職</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>同本年五月的英皇加冕典禮一樣。美國羅斯福總統的就職典禮。替一九三七年增加許多熱鬧。這些熱鬧。利用了最新的科學發明。使全世界人類。同時參加。羅斯福的就職演說。同三十萬羣衆歡呼的聲音。藉交通部上海電台的轉播。我們處在地球這一邊的人。也能聽見。美國總統就職。自華盛頓以來。都是在三月四日舉行的。前年美國修改憲法。才把就職日期提前。這一種新的開始。似乎可以象徵。從羅斯福第二度就職之日起。美國歷史。或許會開一個新紀元。</p>
<p>但是。本屆就職典禮最使人注意的。不是富有革新意味的就職演說而是富有復古性質的檢閱台。羅斯福總統故意造一個一八二九年傑克生總統住宅格式的檢閱台。是有深切用意的。據報界魔王哈斯特的說法。除了傑克生以外。美國歷屆大總統。沒有像羅斯福之博得羣衆熱烈擁護的。而羅斯福也隱隱以傑克生為模倣。去年大選之日。他佩戴傑克生的錶鏈。在前次傑克生紀念宴會中。他用傑克生任內的一切。來比較他自己的政績。所以我們不難用這百年前民主黨偉大政治家的一切來推測羅斯福的前途。</p>
<p>傑克生許多的經歷。是和羅斯福相類似的。傑克生就職之初。即大興土木。開河道。闢公路。而羅斯福的工賑政策。結果也是造了許多偉大工程。如大水閘大橋樑等。傑克生任用私人。收引黨徒。開美國分贓制度之始。羅斯福在第一次就職後。兩年以內。畀民主黨人以新職者。達十萬以上。傑克生破壞了內閣成規。而創立了所謂“廚房內閣。”决定政策。不與各部長謀商。而專同幾位親信密談。羅斯福亦有所謂“頭腦托辣斯”之組織。一切革新計畫。都由幾位教授為之策畫。傑克生實行貨幣减價。羅斯福在一九三四年一月。將美幣之價格。减到百分之五十九。傑克生對於最高法院。非常蔑視。不准最高法院來干涉行政立法大權。羅斯福對於最高法院的宣布新法違憲。更其痛恨。他在最近四年以內。或許要改組最高法院。</p>
<p>傑克生兩度當選博得人民很大的擁護。在他第二任的最後兩年因貨幣膨脹政策之結果。地產之價大漲。美國達於空前之繁榮狀況。然而人為的繁榮。畢竟是空中樓閣。當他第二任滿期時候。美國遂入於絕大經濟恐慌之中。羅斯福的政策同抱負。頗有類於傑克生。雖然一個是聰明的政客。一個是豪爽的軍人。但好大喜功之心。勇往直前之志。頗無二致。在今後四年以內。羅斯福或許會重遭傑克生的命運吧</p>

<p>寺內陸相答、對於日本政治動向、若謂有特殊傾向、當屬幻想、其他濱田君之議論中、似乎責備一部分軍人、頗堪遺憾、實為違背軍民一致之趣旨、</p>

<p>對意親善</p>
<p>前次帝國政府將廢止駐阿帝國公使館改設領事館之旨、通告意大利政府、同時意政府亦言明對於帝國在阿之通商上其他之利益保護、與以好意的考慮、目下基此趣旨、進行商議訂立恊定、此不外帝國政府即於現實之事態、且考慮與意國之親善關係、而採適當之措置而已、</p>
<p>對俄方針</p>
<p>帝國對於蘇聯之方針、在於確立維持正常關係、固無論矣、帝國政府以解决日蘇間之各懸案、為增進兩國善鄰關係之道、故由此見地、於去年中關於修正漁業條約、確定“滿”蘇國境及處理紛爭問題等、進行交涉、同時關於北庫頁汕由試掘延長問題、援助日本當業者代表與蘇聯政府當局間之交涉、</p>
<p>石油問題、去年十月日本當業者代表與蘇聯政府當局間成立試掘期限延長五年之契約、又新漁業恊定、經一年有半商議之結果、至去年十一月中旬已確定案文、正將簽字之際、蘇聯政府忽稱國內手續未完、要求延期簽字、其後迄未允簽字、日本以</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>北洋漁業權之本質、及其行使規定之漁業條約、不容中斷、再三喚起蘇聯之注意、折衝之結果、於去臘二十八日訂立暫時協定、使本年之出漁得暢行無阻、至關於恊定之簽字交涉、自然繼續進行、期其解决、又“滿”蘇國境確定及紛爭處理委員會之設置、認為於防止曰“滿”蘇三國間之紛爭、有多大之貢獻、於調整三國間之國交所益非淺、故由此見地、由日本進而提倡之、對於此事之原則的問題、除一二點外、意見業已一致、帝國政府極希望本問題得從速解决也、</p>
<p>帝國政府既如此致力謀與蘇聯確立和平關係、乃蘇聯方面不僅於蘇“滿”加境維持不均衡之軍備、甚至稱日本之行動為侵略的此余所深引為遺憾者也、深信蘇聯方面須諒解帝國之和平的意圖、反省自己從來之態度、解决兩國間之各問題、始可期日蘇關係之正常化也、</p>
<p>日偽關係</p>
<p>上屆議會亦曾言之帝國政府將益謀日“滿”兩國民之融和、使兩國善隣不可分之關係、益加強固、因此之故、於撤廢在“滿洲國”之治外法權、調整乃至移讓南滿洲鐵路附屬地行政權之方針之下、其第一階段、已於去年六月十日與“滿洲國”訂立撤廢治外法權一部、及調整滿鐵附屬地行政權之條約、又日“滿”經濟關係亦益增緊密之度、此殊堪慶賀者也、</p>
<p>對英對美</p>
<p>對於英國、帝國政府強化日英兩國傳統的關係之方針、迄未少變、立於兩國之大局的見地、英國對於日本之立塲、日本對於英國之立塲，與以充分同情之考慮、兩國之利害關係自然有調整之道、叮無疑也、帝國政府為此目的之故、將益努力不懈、</p>
<p>與美國之關係、最近益趨良好、此蓋一面由於帝國之既定方針、在於日美兩國確保太平洋之和平、一面由於美國方面漸次理解東亞之事態所致、此友好關係今日當更使之增進、</p>
<p>國際貿易</p>
<p>帝國政府希望與南洋方面保持密接之經濟關係、惟對此希望、有種種中傷或誤解者、然帝國政府絕未藏有何等侵略的意圖、惟希望藉增進和平友好關係、以期通商之發展、資源之開發而已、</p>
<p>日本之通商貿易、雖各外國採用各種之制限、然去年達未曾有之高額、此足表示日本經濟及產業之非常活潑、又此等制限、其性質非專恃外交交涉不能打開者故帝國政府於外交上為最善之努力、茲舉其顯著者言之、帝國政府為對抗澳洲之防遏日貨、曩對澳洲不得不發動通商擁護法、其後開始通商交涉、折衝數月之後、至去年杪卒達到圓滿之諒解、而恢復正常關係、對於荷領印度、去年中籍帝國政府及荷領政府之斡旋、成立荷印方面所主張為通商交涉前提之彼我海運業者間之協定、至是兩國間始得開始通商商議、目下尚在繼續折衝、已有相當進展、又與英領印度之通商交涉亦大有進步、</p>
<p>開拓市塲</p>
<p>除此等外交交涉之外、帝國政府於舊市塲之維持發展、於世界各地新市塲之開拓、均傾全力付之、以期日本貿易之活躍、於去春特別議會、曾言為國際貿易障礙之措置、其範圍傾向擴大、此事對於如日本不得不於海外確保原料國之供給及製品之銷路以維持國民經濟的生存之國、非常重大、其後足認為此等障礙措置和綏證據之事態、雖似稍稍發生、然遂行此事之各種制限、依然存續、余深信此時所最必要者、各國最少為實現通商之自由起見、須適用如剛果盆地條約之公正的絛約之精神、於其殖民地市塲、余認為此與最近原料資源分配問題之考究實現、於和緩世界焦急氣分、貢獻和平、同為有效適切之方法也、　　　文化事業</p>
<p>最后對於文化事業尚有一言、一國之文化係其國民性之表現、諒解之即所以根本的認識其國、然後始能確立國際正義、實現真正之國際協力、尤其如日本有最古之特殊的文化之國、向海外大事宣揚、足使世界洞悉日本之活動精神、深信此為必要之舉、故政府由此見地、益努力於本事業、</p>
<p>以上為政府之外交方針、及最近外交經過之大要、於此複雜機微之目下內外情勢之下、對於帝國所遭遇之許多困難、須無間朝野、慎重應付、以期亳無遺誤、此固無待言者、對於國策之遂行、深信不可不舉國一致、以十分之注意行之、此余衷心期諸君恊力不置者也、（二十一日同盟電）</p>

<h3>馬塲藏相演說財政</h3>
<p>［東京］馬塲藏相之演說要旨如左、</p>
<p>昭和十二年度預算、較去年度增加相當數量、而今後尚須加入國策關係之臨時經費、是以債券之膨脹暫時繼續、當屬難免、此次對於上項情形、企圖增稅以及其他增加收入之計畫、亦有常年度之增加收入、故今後數年間發行公債總額、大致其與於十二年度之總額程度、此後公債數量預料當可漸次减少、今乘此機會、略將政府之財政經濟政策加以述明、政府為期待產業貿易得到健全發展、並减輕國民全體在金融上之負擔起見、自內閣成立以來、觀察金融界之實况、實施低利政策、而政府方面仍繼續期望低利漸次進行、又自去年五月一日至九月十五日、其間將總額達到二十一億餘圓之五分利國庫債券、借用三分半利之國庫債券、但政府方面對於國債、暫時仿欲維持現在之利息水準、剩餘之五分利及四分半利之公債計二十九億餘圓、亦擬在適當時機實行借換低利、去年對外貿易之總額、內外進出口合計達五十七億二千五百餘萬圓、表示日本貿易市塲之新紀錄、固可認為順暢、然此種趨勢亦未可久恃、值此國際經濟形勢複雜之際、為繼續維持原價之安定起見、則有待於運用外國匯兌者不少、政府於去年底根據外國匯兌管理法、實行更正省令復鑑於最近輸入增加等類之傾向、故講求臨時應急措置、政府今後當留意平時資本之國際移動、應其情勢、為防止資本逃避及匯兌行情之動搖起見、講求萬全之方策、同時在運用匯兌之實際管理時、不使給與產業與貿易上之障礙、擬切實加以注意云云、（二十一日同盟電）</p>

<h3>英法商定對德談判方針</h3>
<p>經濟援助不得擴充軍備　德報亦謂願與各國合作</p>
<p>［倫敦］外相艾登昨往日內瓦、道出巴黎、曾與法國國務總理萊翁勃侖、進行談話、此間政界人士、頃接獲巴黎電訊、得悉雙方業已商定、他日苟在經濟金融上援助德國、必須附以兩種條件、㊀其他各國需要援助者、當與德國享受同等待遇、㊁此項援助、無論如何、不得用以擴充軍備、政界人士對於此項消息、表示滿意、加之昨日談話時、法國國防總長達拉第亦在座、因而相信當時曾就各國逐漸减縮軍備與公佈軍事預算兩事、一併討論之、但以為此層究能與德國成立切實妥協否、仍屬一種疑問、緣按之柏林方面傳來消息、一切方案、凡用以解决歐洲一般問題必須德國變更現行政策•方式•與目標者、該國均不願加以考慮故也、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］英外相艾登在下院演說、德報均加評論、對於艾登所稱西班牙人之西班牙問題之唯一途徑、表示贊成、對於英外相未能說明英國是否願運用其勢力、以重建西班牙之主權、則表示遺憾、開於艾登對德國之忠告、各報認為德國常表示與各國合作之願望、可由多次建議證明之、但合作必須限於公共幸福而努力之國家、艾登以信任為合作之前提、各報亦表贊同、並謂德國人必須獲得發展信任心之機會、使彼等信任從前之仇敵、目前已懷抱好意矣、關於艾登建議於國聯之機構內、實現國際合作之意見、各報均表示不能信任、日內瓦之集體主義、因此項制度不能消除全世界之紛爭也、且於國聯幕後所訂之公約、不惟不能消除歐洲之不安現象、反足以增加不安耳、不若德國建設直接友好關係之制度、可以獲得實際效果、改進歐洲局勢云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］今日得悉、意德兩國對歐洲大局之態度、自戈林將軍與墨索里尼會談後、日益顯明、聞意國願與歐洲列強合作、惟此種合作不得容蘇俄加入、其條件須與已往兩年者異、蓋四國公約今已成過去之事、所謂斯特萊薩陣綫亦已粉碎、永不能再用矣、（二十日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統二届任內繼續為貧苦謀福利</h3>
<p>就職演說時與民同冒雨雪　總統府僅以茶點欵待貴賓</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統今日鄭重聲明、政府將繼續為四千餘萬權利不足之美國人民、謀生活之進步、繼即開始就第二任總統職、羅斯福總統演說之時、科頭立雨雪中、演說台上原有避彈玻璃掩護、嗣由羅斯福令人撤去、並謂“衆人皆能冒此雨雪、予何獨不可”、就職之時、由最高法院院長休士監誓、其他法官亦皆列席、惟史東因病、白蘭地斯因體質過弱、未能參加、總統未到之前、羅斯福夫人因諸法官皆年事甚高、先命白宮侍從以長袍進、俾可禦寒、宣誓之時、為十二時二十九分、按憲法規定、總統須於正午就職、故今日美國有二十九分鐘、在法律上並無總統、總統來時、原乘轎車、惟見羣衆皆立雨中、復返白宮另易敞車、以致夫人之新帽、亦被雨雪所毀、後總統於檢閱遊行隊時、已將濕衣易去、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統宣誓就職發表演說、並出席白宮兩次茶會、今晚就寢頗早、今日總統舉行就職典禮之前、曾邀各界要人七百餘人至白宮進茶點、所食者為冷肉三明治•冰淇淋•咖啡、軍隊冒大雨遊行街衢、經過總統觀壇後、至白宮進茶點者、復有三千人、兩次茶會、總統均蒞席片刻、但羅夫人則招待甚殷懃、今日雖大雨如注、總統仍在國會外露天演說壇行宣誓典禮、拒絕在國會內舉行、總統指國會外觀禮之五萬民衆、遍體淋濕曰、“彼等能耐大雨、余亦能之、”總統太夫人與其公子文孫今日皆參加就職典禮、四代參加盛典、實美國有史以來之第一次、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］全國政治金融商業各界、今日皆預料羅斯福總統就職演說之自然結果、為政府重施壓力、以達行政目的、總統雖未竭力攻擊投機事業、故垣街之反影、為各種價格一律上升、然總統决將領袖政府、促進新政哲學之社會經濟計劃、則毫無疑義也、（二十日國民電）</p>

<h3>市社會局調查全市私塾統計</h3>
<p>市區總計有四五二所　塾師登記後將加訓練</p>
<p>（註）尚有蒲淞區、未曾調查、上海市社會局為謀整頓及改進本市私塾起見、曾於上月二十三日起、舉行全市私塾總調查、並於本月二十日起舉辦全市塾師總登記、茲將調查結果、及整頓計劃、分誌如次、</p>
<p>一般情形　此次調查者僅係市區、結果共有私塾四百五十二所、每所塾師均係一人、故其數量亦為四百五十二人、以男子佔極大多數、女塾師僅有六人、而男塾師中以江北籍者佔多數、其年齡大半在四十歲以上、學生數共有一萬餘人、以閘北區為最多、所址多在草棚之中、除桌椅外無其他設備、學期與普通學校不同、每年分三節、以陰歷為標準、年節至端午為第一節、端午至中秋為第一節、中秋至年底為第三節、收費每生每節最高為七元、最低為一元、普通均為二元或三元、收入最多者、每校每年六百元、（坐館除外）課程以國文•習字•珠算為主體、論語孟子四書五經隨處都是、上課頗隨便、學生於上課時間可自由出入、衣服不必整潔、學費可分期繳納故一般家長頗願意送其子弟入私塾、塾師資格大半係私塾出身、鮮有學校畢業者、</p>
<p>開始登記　社會局以調查結果、私塾之腐敗如此、故即舉辦塾師總登記、以求逐步改善、登記已於二十日開始、登記者須隨帶二寸半身照相二張、親自赴局填具登記表、並予以口試、兩日來登記者頗為踴躍、至二月十日截止、登記完畢後、即舉辦塾師訓練所、以謀澈底整頓、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>多頭重起維持棉紗近期尤昂</p>
<p>遠期亦為其拉起不少　惟現紗售價紛紛下跌</p>
<p>紗市晨疲午漲、氣勢轉挺、蓋以本月交割時期日近、市傳交貨雖有三•五千包、然多方納胃亦健、預備儘量而收之、同時在二月期吸收之額始終不放棄、近期益昂、遠月激起矣、但現紗交易殊覺凋敝、全日成交僅不滿三百包、售價紛紛下跌、</p>
<p>二月紗大戶續拖　標紗前市開盤、因大阪三品紗續升人氣平平、各月均升一•二角、但塲中買勢薄弱、惟二月期大戶繼續拖進、二盤後聞現紗沉寂、市價頻頻下降、人心牽動、各月復趨下游、結果二月期比上日收盤價獨漲二角、其餘皆跌二•七•九角、午後開盤、本月忽然漲起一元四角、傳言多方收貨量宏大、對十二月期堅不放鬆於是人心動盪、遠期滯好、檯面愈拍愈緊、但現紗交易非常淡泊、至收盤時漲力尤強、結果各月比上午收盤價漲一元八•九角至二元、查賣出德大一千一百五十包大孚一千二百五十包、裕大一千三百包、大豐八百包、明德二千六百五十包豐泰一千五百五十包、仁豐二千包、福康二千○五十包、信誠八百包、益昶一千二百五十包、生源八百包、買進賡豐五千包、恒益一千三百包、振大一千包、泰昌一千八百五十包、長豐二千包、恊成九百五十包、大昌成一千二百包、永大七百五十包、長餘六百包、聚興五百包、裕康五百包、吉豐五百包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>產價不鬆棉花套賣漸缺</p>
<p>棉市始跌繼漲、市情轉趨良好、但海外美棉印棉仍在疲境中、且廠需不暢、大都看跌、實則標紗回漲、加之地頭售價、扳緊不鬆、套賣者殊感缺乏也、</p>
<p>標花回好二三角　標花前市開盤、因海外印美棉市俱見下墮、加之紗市不振、賣氣益盛、各月俱跌五分至一角、二盤仍乏上升力量、迨至收盤、三品花來電遠期續漲一元外、市况略昂、結果各月比上日收盤價尚跌五分至一•二角、惟四月期漲五分、午後開盤隨紗市上漲、且氣勢緊張、塲內賣者不旺、二盤後仍趨上進、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一角半至四角半、查賣出裕大三千五百擔、吉豐一千擔、明德一千擔、賡豐二千四百擔、大昌成三千六百擔、益昶一千二百擔、同和三千六百擔、新華三千四百擔、明華一千一百擔、泰昌一千六百擔、長豐一千九百擔、經華一手擔、信誠二千九百擔、益康一千四百擔買進恒益六千擔、大豐一千擔、潤康三千擔、生源一千一百擔、新昶一千六百擔、泰興二千八百擔、元一二千一百担、福康二千八百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>美棉收盤市氣重振</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、交易尚活、因利物浦電訊不佳、汽車業工潮仍重、及日本財政情形不利、各月跌一至九磅音、旋以同業買進、一部份反動、終以多頭重起了結、合作社及西幫賣出、市况再疲、將收盤前、股市有力、羅斯福總統就職演辭、加以同業買進近月、市價又有起色、收盤堅穩、計現貨跌六磅音、期貨漲一磅音至跌三磅音、英棉現貨跌六點、期貨跌二至四點、印棉初因老多頭了結而疲、旋因歐洲出口商買進、並有買進印棉以抵利物浦方面售額、同時套賣缺少、市價回好、計平果爾跌○•五至一羅比、奧姆辣跌○•二五至一•五羅比、白羅溪跌一•二五羅比、原電錄左、（二十日電）</p>

<p>津棉商營業屢經挫折</p>
<p>天津棉花市塲在去年（二十五年）一年間、細絨花駸駕粗絨以上、滬商與日商來津駐壯收貨者、共增加五戶、惟因市况鋒鋩太銳、底價增高、棉商時有危險、上半年間、細絨最大價至六十二元、下半年最大價僅六十元、粗絨上半年增至四十八元、下半年在七•八•月青黃不接之際、漲至四十九元、於是棉商盈餘最多每包五•六元、及至新花上市、頭盤四十五元半開出後、逐步徘徊、歲抄始復返至四十七元半、四十八元之價僅一現而已、棉商中途屢經挫折、獲利希望甚少、多數維持平局、棉棧按固定收入因本年貿易增加盈餘四•五•萬元至一•二•萬元不等、</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>染坯色布成交獨多</p>
<p>落令斜紋絨削價出售</p>
<p>昨日標紗雖同漲二元、而現紗跌勢仍烈、布市受其牽制、趨勢仍疲、日商各洋行白貨開數寥落、津幫及一部份同業均傾向賣出、市面益受壓迫、東疋白貨以細斜勢最不振、續降（每疋）五分、細布尚堅回小二分半、原布粗布均告堅定、成交以本街染廠及批發部、色布染坯居最多數蓋常年例規各染坊在舊曆十二月二十日後、即將停止工作、故必須於此時趕緊發染、以備春盤應市、故連日細布市布成交尚有可觀、本廠白貨亦以細布細斜為最軟、客銷岑寂、本街染廠吸胃有限、均跌五分至一角、粗布粗斜以存貨淺薄、市勢穩定、斜紋絨落令貨昨續有斬出、慶豐十六磅雙魚吉慶跌進十一元內、與九月底開盤價相埒较之十一月份頂峯十五元、已跌去四元外、客帮惟青島濟南洛陽徐州印花貨花布色丁直貢去胃尚佳川帮續辦藍布元灰斜餘路頗外動訊、</p>
<p>元芳羽綢跌多漲少</p>
<p>昨週四逢本埠元芳洋行、第三千零二十四次拍賣、為廢曆年關、仍然向規延期、寬放六星期現洋出貨、陳列泰西緞•元絨直貢呢•羽綢•洋紅布五種、計四十六牌共六十六箱、開拍泰西緞五牌、每碼比上期跌、分至五分二五、元絨兩牌跌四分至七分、頁昵無甚軒輊、羽綢拍五十七牌、疋價亦見下墜、伯子圖•燕國公•彩八士三牌降八九角二美鸞鳳五星海牛蝶仙跌半元左右、其餘降二三角、平占多數、惟花燭竹林人球三牌升一角左右、洋紅布叫輕磅價已平疲云、</p>
<p>厚貨呢絨售盤减低</p>
<p>昨呢絨毛貨銷路、因天時環境關係、逐步見减、冬令厚貨、除本街各帮隨時添辦外、餘無交易各貨漲風大半均已平息惟洋行定貨生意則仍繁盛、而定價亦多報漲、公會上市面、大半明堅暗平、厚貨呢絨賣方均肯减價出售云、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>粉價回漲</p>
<p>麥價帶起</p>
<p>粉市昨上午開盤後、各月份市面、一致回振頗速、以洋麥報價、芝加哥麥市初開甚堅、旋因浮多了結、外國市軟、維持衰退、市面轉形參差、收盤價目自跌六二五至漲三七五、合國幣近小四分、遠好八分至二角、坎拿大跌八分至一二角、洋麥雖小、惟前週以來、跌勢之狂、亦出意料之外、故多空雙方意思已漸接近、多頭之回脫未暢、空頭則均思補、是以開價即步步上升、計漲三分左右、迨至下午開盤、本月份因客帮微有抽動、人心逐穩、遠期各月份、以廠方出數甚少、浮空亦陸續抵補、故喊價又步步高振、此種情形、半屬大跌之回頭、半矚業外人心、又復堅挺、故回漲三五六分、後步如實銷已動則市氣當可暫時站住云、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤、初尚平靜、繼亦高振、以洋麥報價、仍見微小、故各月份交易、依然不暢惟以出數較稀、二三四月份、較好二三分、本月份未有做開、六月份無出入、迨至下午開盤、因粉市回漲頗烈、致業中人心思、一致帶俏、較之前日之收價、訐回漲八分至一角二分、不過後步情形、仍看粉銷如何、市氣方能穩定也、現麥市面、因標準上落不定廠家與行客、意思未能接近、故又無正式見交云、</p>
<p>粵商趁低價進客秈</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、因粵帮繼續暢辦、市面更形活潑粵省雖有洋米稅暫記之核准、目下滬市價低、正可趁機暢辦、昨日辦成漢口糙米等一萬多包、機晚各米亦有四五千包、糙米粤銷最旺、而存到並不見多故市面已被拉起五六分、機米因存到兩旺、貨主與行販以年底結束關係、亦亟亟求脫、故交易雖活、機米反見疲小三五分、全日開出江西米一萬一千三百多包、湘米八百○七包、漢糙一萬包、溫甬米四千一百五十包、小絞一百包、多數為粵帮辦去、其次為本街油頭等應酬甚微、</p>
<p>河下米市不易展開</p>
<p>（灑北）昨日河下各路來源三十餘號、市上銷路平淡、白粳高料價平疲、中次者早市仍欲喊緊、後因去路懈淡、價形回軟之勢、早薄稻堅定、白元貨旺、價轉軟弱、陰元貨稀、價仍挺秀、其餘各貨定勢、</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源六十餘號、貨共萬二千五六百石、內中薄稻有三十餘號、市况仍疲軟、計青島帮共去簿稻千餘包、行情除高料貨賴到源有限尚平、餘如中關者悉步落近角、厚粳自連日跌價後、店胃略動、市色轉定惟觀大局、照此時屆廢曆暮歲、欲轉好面、似屬不易耳、杜洋尖及陰變元與粳市相仿、不過南港早稻因價位較高、削低角許、</p>
<p>黃豆芝蔴支持平穩局面</p>
<p>昨日洋荘芝蔴仍開十五元一角半、及十五元一角、成交五百噸、刻下人心雖虛、但去路尚有、大局得以支持、黃豆亦然、如豆餅銷塲陸續不斷、僅成交數稍有升縮、而行情仍得穩定、則黃豆貨主尚不願輕售、祇有預備結束之小數戶稍見遷就、昨市蚌埠豆由榨油廠辦去三車、本街及廣帮成交東北豆四五百包、及杜豆沙黃四百包、福州通州內地本街等採取漢口遲乍豆、共計二千餘包云、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>紐約期絲回漲白廠經吃價尚未相符</p>
<p>昨日海外絲價均見回漲、計紐約近期漲二分、遠期漲三分、橫濱現貨漲二十元、遠期漲二十元、故美荘來電、對白廠B字七八勻度RR吃價八二五元、較前日已漲起十元、但此價距華商持價尚相差十元許、仍少成交、昨日僅達昌連納購進高級白廠數十件、其他僅印荘略有零星買賣、昨計共成交七十包、</p>
<p>英倫紅茶滯銷跌價</p>
<p>英倫為紅茶銷售集中地、關係甚大、據最近傳來消息、倫敦紅茶銷路、依然不振、英印茶商、向恃新年過後之大量轉口生意、現則因歐洲空氣不良、與夫各國經濟枯竭影響、銷數銳减、即我國祁門紅茶、亦因市塲之不景氣、百五十元以上之貨、未能十分暢銷、售價多逐步下跌、其最滯銷者、厥為花香末片之類、商家多减價脫售、虧折最大、就一般茶商觀察、將來祁茶定價、較往年勢必减低云、</p>
<h3>金融</h3>
<p>純金雖升金價反小七角</p>
<p>買方又呈旁觀</p>
<p>金市昨初以海外銀市俱縮滙兌亦降倫敦生金漲一便士、中央銀行掛牌揭曉英美俱平、海關金單位漲三厘、標準標金價掛牌升為一一五二元三角、晨開微高、開後有行無市叫賣者較湧、塲內缺少維持、成交雖清、市况則疲、後以現貨號家等稍售而降大戶乃來納條、而後略定、後市缺乏多大變化、盤旋而已、今將一天市况誌後、</p>
<p>晨開為一一五三元七角、較前收微升二角、開後有行無市、叫賣者極多缺乏維持、裕新祥大德成賣至三元一角、成大進至三元三角、大德成又賣到三元、久大同裕潤元茂永進至三元二角、滙豐掛牌英美俱平、以及白銀平衡稅縮半分、形勢不定恒昌永生源永洪昌永紛售、跌至二元半、慶發永趁低納條、午收為二五二元九角、</p>

<h3>「偉大的良心」</h3>
<p>— 麗尼</p>
<p>業餘劇人自從組合以來，就努力於排演古典劇，但是，無形之中，卻好像規定了一個範圍，那就是，必然是屬於寫實主義的：以前出演的“娜拉和“欽差大臣”是這樣，這回上演的“黑暗底勢力”（慾魔）和“雷雨”又是這樣。這樣的選擇很令我贊同，私心覺得對目前戲劇上的新運動是十分有益的事，所以，每一次我都高興來說兩句話。這裏的，是關於托爾斯泰和“黑暗底勢力”的一二事情。</p>
<p>記得許多年前，曾有一部名叫“良心復活”的中國影片，那是根據托爾斯泰小說“復活”改編的；這一次，我看見關於“黑暗的勢力”的說明書，那上面也有劇中人尼基達因為“良心發現”而作出了懺悔的話。托爾斯泰曾被稱為“偉大的良心”，將“良心”和托爾斯泰聯在一起，實在是有着深遠的淵源的。然而，我怕將托爾斯泰和良心聯在一起之後，將使這偉大的作家祇是落在消極的光影裏，而會掩蔽了他底積極的一面的。托爾斯泰，在他底半個世紀的活動裏，提出了無數關於社會主義的具體的問題，對於這些問題，我們必須較之對於他自已底道德完成付與更大的注意，然後才可以對這偉大的藝術家底全貌，得到更清楚的認識。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰底主要活動，是一八六一年以後的，殘存於半農奴制度制下的革命前期的舊俄羅斯——鄉村的俄羅斯，地主與農民的俄羅斯。“黑暗底勢力”對於舊俄羅斯所提出的問題，是絕對真實的，強有力的，然而，他解決這些問題之際所現出的矛盾和忙亂，就正是可供我們思考的地方。對於私有財產制度以及其他種種的抨擊，托爾斯泰和我們是站在一條戰綫上的；然而，將問題底解決引到個人底道德完成上，托爾斯泰却和我們相距着一段里程了。</p>
<p>“黑暗底勢力”完成於一八八六年，但是，在當時的檢查制度之下，並不曾立刻得到上演的許可。在此，說一說舊的俄羅斯對於這偉大的天才的迫害，使我們除了他底少數劇本以外得不到更多的劇作，我想，這事對於我們是有意義的。下面是托爾斯泰自己底話：</p>
<p>“我很高興寫作更多的劇本，並且，我感覺我有特殊的需要，在那方面表現我自己：可是，我深知檢查官是不會通過我底劇作的。說來你也許不會相信，自從我在這方面的活動開始以來，可怕的檢查問題就怎樣苦惱着我！我要依我所感覺的去寫作，可是同時，找也知道我所寫作的是不會被通過的；因此，我不得已放棄這種工作了。放棄着，放棄着，而一年一年就過去了。”</p>
<h3>“黑暗底勢力”的一個塲面</h3>
<h3>奧斯特洛夫斯基與“雷雨”</h3>
<p>— 旅岡</p>
<p>關於舊俄時代的戲劇家奧斯特洛夫斯基，在中國似乎還不很引起人們的注意。然而十九世紀的俄國，無論在文學上或舞台上，他的作品却是最具有誘人的魔力的；所以，Brucrner說：“如果有什麼人願意知道俄羅斯，他應該讀些奧斯特洛夫斯基的著作。”其實奧斯特洛夫斯基并不止在十九世紀有這麼巨大的影響，就是在二十世紀，他的作品依舊為廣大的人們所愛好。比方，在一九三三—三四年，蘇聯的演劇季節中，他的二十三個作品，在莫斯科就已經有二十六個劇塲用三十七種方法來演出；而其中十七種演出，還是最初的嘗試。</p>
<h3>雷雨中的女主角卡鐵林娜</h3>
<p>自然，奧斯特洛夫斯基之所以有如此巨大的影響，决不是沒有理由的。克魯泡特金認為：奧斯特洛夫斯基“是劇塲與戲曲家相互影響的最好底表現。”而野崎韶夫則說：“奧斯特洛夫斯基是一位最“演劇底”的作家。”</p>
<p>接着，野崎韶夫又叙述着“奧斯特洛夫斯基為什麼會這樣牽引着蘇聯的觀衆，演員和導演者們”的第二個理由：“是因為蘇聯演劇的主導底傾向是寫實主義。”…</p>
<p>真的，在舊俄寫實主義的作家之中，奧斯特洛夫斯基底偉大的成就是不可忽視的。昇曙夢在“俄國現代思潮與文學”一書中曾說：“……果戈理的寫實主義，其後由岡察洛夫，奧斯特洛夫斯基，屠介湼夫，杜思退益夫斯基，托爾斯太等，而更加發展到圓熟的境界……。”從這裏，可以想到奧氏在俄國寫實主義的文學之路上底不可磨滅的功績。一般地說，普式庚在俄國的文學上是最初奠定了國民文學底基礎的人，而奧斯特洛夫斯基在俄國的劇壇上，則是最初與唯一的國民戲劇的剏造者。</p>
<p>奧斯特洛夫斯基的“雷雨”，和普式庚的“杜布洛夫斯基”一樣，已經在蘇聯被攝成為影片。克魯泡特里認為這是奧斯特洛夫斯基最好的一個戲曲：在“俄國文學的理想與現實”一書中，他說道：““雷雨”是近代俄羅斯舞台演奏中底最傑出的戲曲之一。”其實“雷雨”之所以偉大，並不是如克魯泡特金那樣抽象的說法：僅是令人“驚嘆”而已。主要的是在於：他完全是真實地暴露了俄國小市民層的醜態，一點也不帶着神秘主義的色彩，也不是對於浪漫主義的心醉，或者像象徵主義那產的帶着抽象性。在“雷雨”里，充滿着舊俄時代的抑鬱，不平，與呼‘。暗晦的環境和陰沉的氣氛，使卡鐵林娜不得不走上絕路：跳到伏爾加河去了。………這是非常慘酷的現實的暴露。奧斯特洛夫斯基生長在這個時代里，他有着同樣悒悶的呼吸，體會着這境况，這氣候。當時，有一個批評家朶布洛魯勃夫（Dobruboff），以“黑暗的天國”這個意味深長的題目，寫了兩篇很長的論文來分析奧斯特洛夫斯基的戲劇。這題目，剛好給他說明了他底戲曲的特徵：是暴露着這可怕的“黑暗”。（完）</p>
<h3>“雷雨”中的緊張的一個塲面</h3>
<h3>兒童夜話</h3>
<p>— Ｍ·珂爾佐夫作</p>
<p>“伯薩，你睡着了嗎？”</p>
<p>“是的，我要睡着了。”</p>
<p>“伯薩，我熱得很呢。”</p>
<p>“那末，你踢掉毛毯吧。”</p>
<p>“伯薩，北極是很冷的嗎！”</p>
<p>“要看是在什麼地方。在北極四周的溫度，是在逐漸逐漸地向下降的，一直到它完全消失為止。”</p>
<p>“好玩。它到什麼地方去了呢？誰住在那里？”</p>
<p>“什麼東西全有得住在那裏。熊，狼，還有鸚鵡。在那里天氣是很壞的。到了六月，才開始天氣的變化。”</p>
<p>“明天可是五月一號嗎？”</p>
<p>“是的。你快睡覺吧。明天一整天我們都得坐着貨車東奔西跑。”</p>
<p>“伯薩，為什麼你不是個蘇聯的英雄？”</p>
<p>“沒有空啊！我們正有一大堆的功課，再剩不下時間學飛了。”</p>
<p>“可是為什麼飛行師們要戴護目眼鏡？”</p>
<p>“那是因為在那邊的天空中，空氣都是很薄的，如果你不用護目眼鏡，那簡直看不清任何東西。”</p>
<p>“為什麼它要叫做佛蘭茲。約瑟夫大陸？”</p>
<p>“因為他們老是住在那里的。我希望他們是對雙生子。”</p>
<p>“你是個雙生子嗎？”</p>
<p>“自然不是的。我甚至沒有閑空呼吸，那里會是雙生子。現在功課是多麼的重啊！他們已經增加教師們的薪俸，他們正預備好壓榨我們的油水。可是我們所得的報酬，也是值得感謝的。單單一門算術已經值得這個代價了。博物學也是如此。你知道一隻袋鼠能跳多遠？它竟有三十二尺可跳。”</p>
<p>“你在騙我。”</p>
<p>“是事實。教師也這麼說的。而且，它還只是用兩隻後腿，不然可以跳得更遠些。”</p>
<p>“伯薩，我也要做隻袋鼠，不是嗎？”</p>
<p>“你做不了。它是隻動物，你却是一個孩子。這是絕對不可能的。”</p>
<p>“伯薩，你怎樣懂得了這麼許多？”</p>
<p>“你想，我已經進了三年級哩！”</p>
<p>“伯薩，你見過沙皇嗎？”</p>
<p>“我見過一回。”</p>
<p>“他可怕嗎？”</p>
<p>“不很可怕。當一開始見到他的時候，不論誰都覺得害怕，不瞞你說，我自己也有幾分激動。他有一臉大鬍子。可是以後他動手繞着圈子，織工，廚子，和老祖母罷罷里加都跟着他跑，蜜蜂叮着他們，人們都唱着歌兒，打着鼓兒，他捋起了自己的鬍子，這時候是很有趣的。”（註一）</p>
<p>“老祖母說在列寗格拉有大批的沙皇，可是真的嗎？”</p>
<p>“哼，如果你相信着老祖母的胡言亂語，那你的耳朶都會落掉。什麼沙皇能住在那里？這已跟革命前不同了。現在除了在戲院或者大商店中還需要他們管門以外，我們已經用不着他们。”</p>
<p>“在革命以前可有孩子們嗎？”</p>
<p>“不很多……是的。那時的少年先隊沒有頸巾。”</p>
<p>“你在騙我。”</p>
<p>“是事實。一般的說來，凡在革命以前發生的事情，都可以使我們笑得要死。沒有示威，沒有柑子，也沒有飛機，工人們要躱躱藏藏，薄勃諾夫大叔被監禁着，席米特大叔還沒有一根鬍子。祇有普式庚寫着詩，可是他却給一個法西斯蒂殺死了。”</p>
<p>“啊，你只是騙我。”</p>
<p>“確是事實。我為什麼要捏造故事呢？很多人都是這樣說的。”</p>
<p>“多久以前才是這樣的？”</p>
<p>“四百年以前。我想在那時候我還沒有生出來。我是在八月六號出世的，在我的生日響着大砲。”</p>
<p>“革命前的時代，可能重新開始嗎？”</p>
<p>“當然不可能。你想：已出生的柑子會不會得又落進泥土中去呢？薄勃諾夫大叔不會再坐牢去。席米特的鬍子，就是理髮師把它剃掉，也會得原樣的生長起來。”</p>
<p>“薄勃諾夫大叔在那裏？”</p>
<p>“那是我們的囊珂珀羅斯”（註二）</p>
<p>“你見過他沒有？”</p>
<p>“不曾。我並不裝作曾經見過他。”</p>
<p>“伯薩，你睡着了嗎？”</p>
<p>“是的。你為什麼睡不着？馬上就要打十點鐘了，因為在打過九點十五分以後，已經過了半個鐘頭了。”</p>
<p>“伯薩，他們會給你買一部脚踏車嗎？”</p>
<p>“不知道。恐怕不會吧。不論什麼全跟我不對勁兒，我也實在幹不來什麼好事。算術很困難。這對我並不打緊，可是我如果得了一個很壞的成績，那末媽媽會很激惱……這是我所以經兩個禮拜不到戲院里去了的緣故。你們小孩子們却倒好，沒有什麼事可想，也不要做什麼工作。”</p>
<p>“當我成人的時候，我不想做工。在一星期的六天之中，有五天我都要上戲院裏去。三天到少年先鋒宮，三天到院子裏玩，其餘的日子就是五月一號。”</p>
<p>“老祖母為什麼和你樣這過意不去？”</p>
<p>“為了郵局的緣故。我告訴她們是怎樣裝扮郵差的遊戲：我們跑遍所有的幾層子，所有人都給了信件。她笑着吻我，問我道：“你們這些孩子從那裏變到這麼許多信件？”我回答說：“是從你的寫字檯上拿來的，婆婆！那裏有個用紅絲帶縛着的大包裹。”她聽說不覺號哭而且咒罵。可是我們拿的只不過是信，並不是絲帶。”</p>
<p>“她是有趣的老東西……現在已經沒有多少老傢伙了。就是有，也祇是那些革命前的遺老吧了。”</p>
<p>“伯薩，童話中都是真的故事嗎？”</p>
<p>“也要看情形而定。有些是真的，有些却是牧師們揑造出來。牠們是假的。”</p>
<p>“那個飛毯故事可是真的嗎？”</p>
<p>“是的，那是伏陀辟諾夫。”</p>
<p>“那末睡美人呢？”</p>
<p>“是牧師們空想出來的。”</p>
<p>“那末傑遜取金羊毛和美逖莎的故事呢？”</p>
<p>“是的。我想那是個真的故事。只要看看我們的算術教師。她正是一個美逖莎。對她我並不曾幹過一點惡事。當孩子們拖了一隻死老鼠到教室裏去的時候，我連在也不在。她却也要責罰我。就是演算不錯的時候，她也要像一個賤骨頭似的看着我，取笑着我说：“打听得出你是從谁那裏抄襲來的，一定很有趣的吧。”她不住地嘲弄我，嘲弄我……嘻，你要睡着了嗎？”</p>
<p>“不，我正在想着：假如明天不是五月一號呀！”</p>
<p>“一定是的，一定的。我曾記得這樣許多次的五月一號。當我還很小，只有三歲的時候，即在當時那一天也是五月一號。明天不是五月一號是不可能的。這並不像法西斯蒂的辦法。”</p>
<p>“可是，實在說，法西斯蒂不是有示威運動的嗎？”</p>
<p>“是的，他們有示威運動。可是這對於他們並不十分容易。每分鐘他們都得趕回監獄，看看是不是有工人越獄。”</p>
<p>“他們不是用這方法把自己養肥了嗎？”</p>
<p>“是的，大概他們是養得很肥了。他們還想上這里來呢。”</p>
<p>“為什麼？”</p>
<p>“想我們送人給他們吃。”</p>
<p>“你為什麼知道這樣許多事物呢？”</p>
<p>“這是沒有什麼奇怪的。總之，我已是三年級生了。”（何家槐譯）（註一）出處見普希金的一個童話。伯薩無疑地曾在兒童戲院中見到過它的上演。（註二）蘇聯的教育人民委員。</p>

<h3>交部整頓本市播音事業停止八電台播音權</h3>
<p>因設備簡陋及未換領執照</p>
<p>播音公會已籲請交部救濟</p>
<p>交通部爲整頓本市無綫電廣播電台事業、最近特訓令將設備欠妥之敦本等八電台、限於本月底止、取消播音權、本市民營廣播電台同業公會奉令後、特開會議、呈請交部救濟、兹探誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>停止八電台播音權</p>
<p>交通部電政司、以本市廣播無綫電台事、甚爲發達、但亟要糾正及整頓之處亦多、據經審察結果、特於最近訓令本市電報局、轉播音同業公會、飭令本市敦本·華光·惠靈·周恊記·新聲·同樂·市音·安定·等八電台、限於本月底爲止、着即停止播音、至交通部此次停止該八電台之原因、聞一方面鑒於本市電台數目過多、影響電波呼號、故有减少本市電台之必要、其次因該八電台中有二電台因有特殊事故、須加取締外、餘六電台均因設備簡陋、欠缺之處過多、故限令停止播音、</p>
<p>播音同業公會表示</p>
<p>昨據交通部上海電報局表示，取締敦本等電台、確屬事實、又據播音公會負責人表示、該會已接到各台報告到會、請求轉呈救濟、此次限令拆除之理由大多爲請有許可證有年、尚未換領執照、機件設備簡陋、播音干擾他台等三點、依許可證之期限、確僅有六個月、惟民營電台之未領到執照者尚多、前該公會於二十四年曾據各會員電台備齊文件保證金等彚呈代領、乃當時電信局、以尚無相當辦法、祗令將文件等收存、是亦未能視爲電台之疏忽、至機件設備問題、在民營電台取締規則上、並無明文規定、且各電台之機件圖樣等、事前皆須呈請審核、經核准後、方得建造、事後又須呈請查騐、合格後方准播送、而平日如有訓令添裝機件等、亦遵令辦理、惟民營電台、以資本關係、當不能與國營者設備相提並論、關於干擾問題、以該八電台之電力、並未强大、而其中有一台、自去年因房屋拆除、現尚未覓得相當地位、迄未播音、似無干擾之可能、綜以上情形、均無有意違犯定章之處、當局或有誤會之處、且民營電台、原依營業爲維持、而製造機件、非數千金不辦、一旦限令停播、其機件又不若其他營業之能以轉讓者、將何以善其後、該會業已根據上述情形、呈請交通部及中央廣播事業指導委員會、請予體卹商艱、先行頒佈設備標準、俾各民營電台、知所遵從、而减損失、</p>
<p>調查播音人員完竣</p>
<p>本市電報局、鑒於本市各廣播電台、所有廣播人員之程度高下、對於題材選擇及影響羣衆思想生活頗巨、最近特製成表格、分發調查、對於教育程度一點、最加注意、結果於四百五十七人中、計出身私塾者一百五十九人、佔播音界全體人員三分之一、出身小學者九十九人、佔全體人員五分之一、其中小學去畢業者七十四人、出身中學者一百二十人、佔全體人員四分之一、曾受大學教育者十八名、佔全數二十五分之一、其他不識字及未受教育者共六十一人、故統觀本市播音人員教育程度、尚甚不齊、當局認爲有設法救濟必要、</p>

<h3>“二十年來稀有現象”</h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>十九日本報國際版刊載驚人的各海軍國的造艦競爭，內云現在各國競造軍艦高潮，實為二十年來所未有，“海軍霸主”的英國，甚且有計劃造九十九艘的驚人預算，那自怪不得一般都以這消息而咋舌。去年一九三六，雖未真如預言家所言中為第二次大戰爆發年，但世界的戰雲密佈，與民主和法西兩大陣營對立的尖銳化，各國擴張軍備的狂熱，已使人替這新來的一九三七揑一把汗，雖然新年開頭，艾登曾繼包爾溫所說“今年是和平之年”之後，而說“寗捨大炮而取牛酪”，可是為了海縮期滿，再加以火藥氣味因那“三大巨頭”的一攪，更加濃重，所以即屢屢宣言和平的英國這老大帝國也禁不得不大造其軍艦，以鞏固他海軍帝國的力量了。所以，雖然說起來似乎有點驚人的“二十年來稀有現象”，也自成為意中事了。我們試再看本報十四日要聞中的一段花邊新聞吧，那會更使你覺得這些“稀有現象”的“嘸啥稀奇”呢，這新聞是這樣的：</p>
<p>“克虜伯鋼鐵公司，本屆股東可以分派紅利四厘，此為二十年來該公司所未有之現象。查該公司資本總額為一萬六千萬馬克，一九三四至一九三五年度盈利九百七十萬馬克，一九三五至一九三六年度則盈利一千四百四十萬馬克，即佔資本額百分之九，除股本分派紅利四厘之外，其餘五厘合八百萬馬克，一概作為公積金。但本年度該公司公積金增加數實為二千萬馬克，可見盈利實數不止一千四百四十萬馬克……”</p>
<p>克虜伯兵工廠是什末傢伙，相信盡人皆知，他是德國的，不，是全世界的第一個大軍火商。在第一次世界大戰時，靠了吸取戰塲上各種不同種族的善良的人們的血液而養胖了他的大肚皮。如今，這吸血獸又在這一九三七的新年宣佈他的盈利總額了。一千四百四十萬馬克的盈利數額，相信已不是小數目了吧，何况“實際數額”尚不止這個數目呢。從這盈利額中我們大概已可以嗅到那比一九三六更濃重的火藥氣味，骷髏頭堆積成山的慘景，又依稀在人們的面前了。究竟誰是戰爭製造者，在這兒已充份地顯出他的猙獰的面目，和平的小鴿在那毒氣的霧圍中消失了，沉沒了，再不抬頭！</p>
<p>我們再仔細地想一想吧，所謂“二十年來”，不就是說現在又逢到了一九一四時的世界，列強分割殖民地的時候的情况嗎？二十年來都沒有這末好生意，那是為了給歐戰時累乏了，如今是一九三七了，對！二十年了！世界殖民地再分割的呼聲已由“三大巨頭”喊出而且部份地實行了，那又怎怪得克虜伯公司要大賺錢，而且敢說是“二十年來稀有現象”哩。這不就是靠戰爭盈利的人們的獰笑嗎？</p>
<p>戰，看來已很難避免的了。不特一般口里喊“和平”的列強是那末地備戰狂，而且那“三大巨頭”已經到“不戰則亡”這一境地了，所以我們弱小民族要渴望和平，第一便要以抗戰來消滅那野心勃勃的侵略戰。“二十年來稀有現象”，對的，也許弱小民族對戰神的抗戰會是有史以來稀有的現象哩！</p>
<h3>破冰魚</h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>雪落着，天在矇矓中亮了。</p>
<p>村莊是靜寂的，雪無聲的把田野變成了一片銀閃閃的白浪，風漸漸小了，路上有了趕集去的人，天還陰沈沈的。</p>
<p>賣菜伙子擔着兩大筐白菜，踏的雪花潑刺潑刺地響，大耳蓋的白毡帽下，露出方紫黑色的臉，走一陣，用那粗大的手掌拋把鼻涕，喘口氣，茫然的看看那遼遠的雪程，擔子換了下肩，就又一步步走去。</p>
<p>橋頭秫稭籬笆里，是用蘆葦搭的一個兩開間的小飯館，屋頂的烟囱口，濃濃地向天上噴出股灰色烟氣，木板門開了一半，一個剛剛睡醒的伙計出來掌白木招牌，那上面寫着“葷素大麵，香油燒餅”。掛好，伙計向遠處瞅瞅，打橋對面，叮叮零零的飄來片斷續的鈴聲，清脆的，突破這凌寒的晨風，一個城市里跑外賬的商人，縮作一團的打驢背上跳下來。</p>
<p>“嘿，借光打聽打聽，張俊清住村里那條街？”</p>
<p>“東街，黑大門，對着藥舖，你不吃點什麼？”</p>
<p>“不啦，要完賬回來再吃。”</p>
<p>“這個天還下鄉收賬。”</p>
<p>飯館伙計像對自己說似的，瞅着商人打着小黑毛驢進了村子，他也無聊的</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>走回去。</p>
<p>河邊上有了擔水的人，天更亮了，關着鐵門的木炭廠也把門開了，廚子挑了付吊桶走下坡來，嘴里哼着“十冬臘月喲，好冷天，寡婦的房中心，空半邊，………”一隻黑狗跟在他後面，看見雪地上濕濕的地方，便低下頭去嗅嗅，突的，河中心卜拉拉的發出一串響聲，尾音像碎玻璃般傳到遠方，狗嚎着，廚子向那邊看了一眼，自語着：</p>
<p>“這冷天鑽破冰魚，好小子！”</p>
<p>河灘上一老一少生起了把火，大的木柴在二尺高的火燄中燒着，河心的厚冰上，正有一個傢伙拿着冰鑽，洞洞的鑽冰，他把那冰劃了個三尺見方的圈子，那燿眼的一尺高的鑽頭，在冰面上來往的划刺着，過了陣，一塊大冰猛的給打到老遠的地方，叮冬地響雨聲，便給毛茸茸地雪隔住了。冰慢慢被敲碎了，一方碧色的水流在這堅厚的冰層下動蕩。守火的那老年人，看見這鑽冰漢子立在那里用手抹汗，就曉得已經打通了，便說：</p>
<p>“老二，通了？”</p>
<p>通了！”他說着，提着冰鑽走近火堆來。</p>
<p>站在老人對面的這個二十多歲的小伙子，這時說得赤條條的，肩上披着件長毛老羊皮襖，在腿襠中，他拴上了那隻大得像條短褲的皮口袋，老人拿隻用豬血浸過的豬尿泡，給他包扎上頭髮，他自己在右手的姆指，中指，跟無名指上，各戴上了件小鐵圈，靠着指甲，伸出一寸高很鋒利的彎刀，他蹲在火堆旁，捉起那大肚子黑磁酒瓶，像喝冷水似的嚥了幾口燒酒，抹了下嘴唇，披着皮襖跟那個鑽冰的漢子說：</p>
<p>“二哥，咱下吧？”</p>
<p>他一閃身，把皮襖丟在雪地上，大踏步的邁到冰洞口，用手按着那砍得沒一點楞角的冰層，甫通的下跳進去，那個二哥飛快的跟着跑過來。雙手把住冰鑽，在冰窟口附近弓着身看着，以他多少代傳下來的經驗，瞅着他弟弟在凌冽的冰水中活動。守着火堆的老人這時也走過來，他痛愛那受着冰寒的兒子，他曾經驗過那種冰水中裂膚痛苦的生活，他戰抖抖堆囑咐着那較大的兒子說：</p>
<p>“老二，留心，留心，怎麼樣？”</p>
<p>兒子擺了擺手，走到洞旁邊，水里嘩地伸出隻手來，一條六七斤重的大魚被投到雪地上，魚急燥的跳了幾下身子，喘息着，不一會便靜了。老人高興的抓起那條魚，走回火堆旁，便放在那個裝着水的大牛皮袋里了。</p>
<p>這時那個像條小豹樣健壯的青年人，已爬出冰窟，作哥哥的將皮襖給他披上，誰都忘記了天空中還飄着雪粉，他們奔跑着，近火堆時，哥哥把冰鑽揷在地上，替弟弟解那個裝得累累贅贅的魚兜，父親使乾布給他抹身子，擦乾把燒酒塗上去，他蹲在火堆旁邊，一面烤着，一面使手搓身上的皮膚。</p>
<p>當父親立在他身後替他解頭上那豬血尿泡時，上面凝結成的薄冰，像碎玻璃片似的零落的掉下來。三個人看看那滿滿地魚兜，無言的笑着，作哥哥的正在脫下棉衣，準備第二次跳下冰窟，裝滿另外兩個魚兜。父親說：</p>
<p>“夠買一斗小米了。”</p>
<p>兩個兒子同時崛強的說：</p>
<p>“年底了，好多零碎賬還沒還呢。”</p>
<h3>光電池（電眼）的神奇（下）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>最早的光電池，只有一塊金屬版，對着光的射照，成一個電極。一部分裝在一個金屬器裏，另成一個電極，中間的空間，是大氣壓力中的空氣。今日的光電池，用一塊感光性的金屬版，或玻璃泡裏的一層金箔，作第一電極，再用－塊金屬版作第二電極，兩個電極都藏在一個玻璃管中，裏面的空氣密度，比最初的光電池不及一百萬分之一。那光電池發出來的電力，是極微細的。若非後來發明三極真空管，漸漸達於完美，而把微細的電力增大，足以運用繼電器或表示器的方法，那池是萬不能像今日這般應用。</p>
<p>在大量产生物品的工廠中，能用那池計算各物。若干熱鋼錠經過某種熱度，用人目去數它們，定要頭昏腦脹，若用機械的數器，那熱力也要把牠燒燬。這時只有用“電眼”，才能夠計算數目，辨別顏色，并把大小的種類，一一分開，機械上的一切缺點，“電眼”都能彌補。“電眼”能在某種熱度下鍜鍊鋼條，能把鋼條燒到某種紅度，從爐中取出，並能作其他種種工業用途。</p>
<p>傳影機的收發兩端，都靠光電池的力量。最初的傳影機，由一位德國不聞名的實驗家尼浦柯氏在一八八四年發明時，不過一隻很粗拙的機械轉盤。此後停頓了四十年，然後才知“電眼”聯合應用。起初不過能在實驗室中發生一種極細的形象，後來經過很快的進步，在人目中成了幾乎連接不斷的圖畫。最新最完備的傳影機，是由茲伏里金氏發明，這是像人目一般的光電池。那電池像人目一般，能發出全形，不過這是電子散播的效果。在收接的一端，它把那電子衝動，化成光和影子，同時把圖形整個現出。</p>
<p>有聲電影，是利用從勵磁燈發出的一種準確量度的光錢叢。那燈光用光學律穿過影片上的音紋，而射在電池感光性面上。因為接觸音紋的光綫的量度，是一致而不變的，那音紋上各各不能透過的部分，隨着射在池面上的光量的大小而變化，那配合適宜的度量的細流，經放大後，送到發音器，便發出各種聲音。</p>
<p>荷蘭赫德森河下的隧道，用光電的繼電器計算經過隧道的汽車數目，美國底得律鎮大使橋也用這個方法計算過橋的車辆，紐約城的大百貨商店用光電池作廣告。行路人走近陳列貨品的玻璃窗時，衝斷了光綫，那繼電器立刻活動，窗內便現出廣告數分鐘之久，行路人突然看見了，當然要注目。沒有人的時候，廣告不會亮，那也是一種經濟辦法。還有一種用塗，那是一工廠中用它作烟的表示器和紀錄器，因此可阻止燃料的耗費。危險的機器，用了光電池的方法，可保護工人意外的危險。工人太近那機器，把光綫衝斷，機器便立刻停止運動，或發出警告的聲音。摩天高廈能用光電池使升降機自己上下，不必用人司管。存儲引火品的房間，安置了“電眼”，只須家內發出一縷細烟，便能察覺，立刻大聲報警，或射出滅火液。學校和圖書館有了光電池，室內一黑，電燈自己會亮。造紙工廠有了光電池，它能限定紙的厚薄，遇到厚薄有過和不及的時侯，或紙面破碎，便會發出警告。它在馬車道十字路口能運用交通燈號。它能驗蛋的好壞，和把大小不同的蛋一一分類。這種細微工夫的用途，却不知道還有多少哩。（完）</p>

<h3>派拉蒙慶祝二十五週紀念特殊貢獻“珠聯璧合”</h3>
<p>今天起在大光明獻映</p>
<p>派拉蒙影片公司董事長助克氏，以服務公司歷二十五年，特攝製大批優美影片問世，以資紀念”其第　片“珠聯璧合”Champagne　WaItz，定於本月二十二日在全世界各大戲院同時獻映，本埠大光明大戲院，亦定於今日起開映此片。該片，葛蘭黛史華莎，茀萊特麥克茂萊及買古奧凱等三大明星所主演，這是部媲美“璇宮豔史”的音樂歌舞豔情片，內容包括有爵士音樂與華爾茲音樂的混合奏，古代舞藝與新時代舞藝的大演出，其歌舞塲面之偉大及新穎，的確值得讚美，而二位大明星的演技，亦頗屬不易多得。上圖即助氏小影。</p>
<h3>歐陽飛莉做嚮導員</h3>
<p>以前在電台播音，現已正式進影片公司為演員的歐陽飛莉小姐，她在天一時，曾充當嚮導員。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的，左明編導的“王先生生財有道”，是儘量搜羅現社會各種現象為題材的一部暴露的笑片，而女嚮導員是上海目前流行的一種玩意兒，無論茶樓酒館，舞塲旅舍，到處有她們的足跡，於是左明也就將女嚮導員的題材，收入“王先生生財有道”裏了。歐陽飛莉小姐和寗萱小姐便担任了這嚮導員這角色，演技的確不壞。</p>
<h3>“壓歲錢”中小舞塲舞女生活寫真</h3>
<p>跳舞塲在市面不景氣商業競爭的底下，招徠舞客的方法也就愈來愈奇，特別是小舞塲，票數減低到一元十幾張外，不附加贈品，一般舞女在這樣情形下討生活，她們真夠得凄慘了。</p>
<p>在明星公司最近攝製完成，張石川導演，鄭小秋，胡心靈助導，胡蓉蓉，黎明暉，襲秋霞等二十餘大明星主演的鉅片“壓歲錢”中，對於小舞塲的舞女往往遭受着舞客的凌辱，就有着很深刻的描寫！</p>
<p>白相人從工人手中奪取一塊有喜字的“壓歲錢”後，帶着一種愉快的心情走進在鬥口寫着。元十五跳，裸體表演，神秘贈品廣告的小舞塲，裏面煙雲繚繞，人聲嘈雜，白相人與一個極醜的舞女起舞，不斷的注視別的舞女，他發現有個美麗舞女正與個舞客舞着，他拖着醜舞女到了美舞女前面，將醜舞女推給美舞女的對手，拉過美舞女，那對手看了一看白相人的模樣，祇有忍受，再回看見醜舞女，便廢然罷舞而去。</p>
<p>白相人擁着美舞女狂舞，舉止輕佻，美舞女苦痛已極，舞了很久，美舞女已疲倦不堪，趁機會揩一揩汗，白相人一腳踏痛了她一腳，美舞女請白相人當心一點，竟激起白相人的怒火，順手給舞女一記耳光，又推翻桌子，舞塲經理連忙出來賠罪，答應白相人立刻停美舞女生意，美舞女見停她的生意，要白相人算給她方才跳的舞票，白相人從袋裏摸出那塊從工人手中奪取的“壓歲錢”，向地上一丟，美舞女忍氣拾起來，白相人又將她一把拖住：“一塊錢十五跳，方才只跳了十四跳吶！”又輕佻地擁之而舞。</p>

<h3>Orders Conveyed from the Central Government: Bi Zhigang Arrives in Beijing from Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Reports Made to He Yingqin, Mi Chunlin and Bao Wenyou Remain in Shaanxi, Frontline Situation Still Extremely Grave</p>
<p>[Nanjing] On the 20th, Li Zhigang, together with Mi Chunlin, Bao Wenyou, and others, flew to Xi'an on a Eurasia Aviation plane to convey the Central Government's intentions to Yang Hucheng and others. On the morning of the 21st at 11:00 AM, Li Zhigang departed from Xi'an first, made a brief stop in Luoyang to visit Director Gu Zhutong, and flew directly to Beijing in the afternoon, arriving at Ming Palace Airport at 5:30 PM. After disembarking, he called on Chinese authorities and Minister He Yingqin that evening to report. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] The situation in Shaanxi suddenly turned serious. Bao Wenyou, Mi Chunlin, and others flew from Xi'an to Beijing on the 21st. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, their special plane landed in Zhengzhou, made a brief stop, and continued flying. The peaceful resolution of the Shaanxi affair has reached a final critical juncture. On the 21st, the opposing forces were still in confrontation at the front. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Eurasia Aviation No. 19 giant plane, which carried Mi Chunlin, Bao Wenyou, Li Zhigang, and others to Xi'an on the 20th, returned from Xi'an at 5:00 PM on the 21st, carrying Li Zhigang and the Director of the Shaanxi Construction Factory, Lei Baohua, and his wife, to Beijing. After disembarking, Li immediately went to see He Yingqin to make a report. It is said that Li's future actions will depend on further instructions from Minister He. As for Mi and Bao, they remained in Shaanxi due to matters there and did not come along. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Li Zhigang's visit is due to the post-settlement measures in Shaanxi, which still need to be discussed with the Central Government. Accompanying him was Lei Baohua, the Director of the Shaanxi Construction Bureau who has already resigned. Someone at the airport asked Li whether there was any hope for a peaceful resolution in Shaanxi. Li firmly refused to comment, only saying that the situation in Shaanxi should be announced by the Central Government and that he did not wish to express any opinions. He was also asked why Bao and Mi did not come to Beijing, and he replied that Bao and Mi had completed their missions, so they did not come along. He said that when he would return to Shaanxi would be decided after meeting with the authorities. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Li Zhigang returned to the capital by plane from Xi'an this afternoon. When reporters rushed forward to inquire about the situation, Li did not answer. Half an hour before Li's plane arrived, another plane carrying British Embassy Military Attaché Chuan Ruizhe, US Embassy Deputy Military Attaché Barrade, and Boxston flew from Luoyang. It is said that four British missionaries did not want to leave Xi'an. Xi'an city is currently still peaceful. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan: There is no change on the Weinan front. The rebel soldiers and Red bandits are engaging in rape, abduction, and pillage in the Weinan area. According to people from that area, the rebel bandits are forcing each village to provide ten young women, causing the people unbearable suffering. Many are escaping and committing suicide. There are seven or eight hundred Red bandits with six hundred guns, forcing people to become bandits and forcibly requisitioning food. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] According to road reports, the situation at the front is serious beneath a veneer of calm. The leader of the bandit army went to Xi'an and, after meeting with Yang, returned to the Wei River's north bank. The bandit troops are all stationed on the Wei River's north bank. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] In the Sanyuan area, Red bandits are scattered in the countryside to avoid bombardment by the National Army. They wear grass branches in their hair. More than three thousand female bandits go to the villages every day to promote communization and disguise themselves to dance. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Hang Yi, the Administrative Commissioner of the Second District of Shaanxi, arrived in Beijing via Jin. He went to the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 21st to see Secretary-General Weng, reported on the security situation in the district after the Xi'an Incident, and requested instructions on his next steps. He said that the district is located in remote northern Shaanxi and is still peaceful. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Telegram Requesting Chairman Chiang to Return Early from Leave</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Jiangning County Party Headquarters, directly under the Central Government, telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the 21st, requesting him to return early from leave to preside over the central authorities due to the severity of the national crisis. The original telegram stated briefly: "The disturbances are tense, the Shaanxi Incident is serious. To pacify the country and resist foreign aggression, we urgently need your leadership. We respectfully request you to return early from leave and return to the central authorities to satisfy the expectations of the people." (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Gao Shuangcheng Returns to Yu</h3>
<p>Yulin: Gao Shuangcheng and other military and political officials of northern Shaanxi went to Jin for official business a few days ago. After completing their mission, they returned to Sui. They returned to Yu at about 4:00 PM on the 21st. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bandit and Puppet Troops Very Active in Nanhaoqian</h3>
<p>Newly Formed Troops of An and Wang Ordered to Assist in Defense, Zeng Yanqi Provides Instructions and Returns to Suiyuan</p>
<p>[Tianjin] A telegram from Jining reports that the bandit and puppet troops in Nanhaoqian continue to increase. The troops of Zhang Wanqing and Yin Baoshan have both been placed at the front. A certain party has formed plainclothes teams, under the command of the "Great Han Women's Army Headquarters," operating in Sui West, Baotou, Hetao, and between Datong and Fengzhen, attempting to cut off our lines of communication in case of trouble.

<p>[Guihua] Because of the urgency of the national crisis, Yan Xishan designated last year as the Year of Responsibility and formulated regulations on misconduct by public officials, submitting them to the central government for review to show encouragement.

According to a senior Vatican official speaking to a Reuters reporter, the Pope's physical condition is gradually weakening, which is worrying. The Pope had difficulty sleeping last night due to leg pain. Dr. Milani, the Pope's personal physician, has forbidden the patient from getting out of bed today. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>US President Roosevelt's Inauguration</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Like the British King's coronation ceremony in May of this year, US President Roosevelt's inauguration ceremony adds much excitement to 1937. This excitement utilizes the latest scientific inventions, allowing people all over the world to participate simultaneously. Roosevelt's inaugural address, along with the cheers of 300,000 people, was broadcast by the Shanghai Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications. We, on this side of the globe, could also hear it. The inauguration of the US President has been held on March 4th since Washington's time. It was only when the US amended its constitution two years ago that the inauguration date was moved forward. This new beginning seems to symbolize that from the date of Roosevelt's second inauguration, US history may open a new era.</p>
<p>However, the most noteworthy aspect of this inauguration ceremony is not the innovative inaugural address, but the reviewing stand with its retro nature. President Roosevelt deliberately built a reviewing stand in the style of President Jackson's residence in 1829, which is deeply meaningful. According to the media mogul Hearst, no president in US history has won such enthusiastic support from the masses as Roosevelt, except for Jackson. And Roosevelt also implicitly imitated Jackson. On the day of last year's election, he wore Jackson's watch chain. At the previous Jackson commemorative banquet, he used everything during Jackson's term to compare his own achievements. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to speculate on Roosevelt's future using everything of this great politician of the Democratic Party a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Many of Jackson's experiences are similar to Roosevelt's. At the beginning of Jackson's tenure, he started large-scale construction projects, opening waterways and building roads. Roosevelt's work relief policy also resulted in the construction of many great projects, such as large dams and bridges. Jackson appointed private individuals and recruited partisans, starting the US spoils system. Within two years of Roosevelt's first inauguration, he gave over 100,000 new positions to Democrats. Jackson broke the conventions of the cabinet and created the so-called "Kitchen Cabinet," deciding policies without consulting with various ministers, but only having secret talks with a few confidants. Roosevelt also has the so-called "Brain Trust" organization. All innovative plans are planned by a few professors. Jackson implemented currency devaluation. Roosevelt devalued the price of the US dollar to 59% in January 1934. Jackson had great contempt for the Supreme Court, not allowing the Supreme Court to interfere with administrative and legislative powers. Roosevelt hates even more the Supreme Court's declaration that the new law is unconstitutional. He may reorganize the Supreme Court within the next four years.</p>
<p>Jackson was elected twice and won great support from the people. In the last two years of his second term, as a result of the monetary expansion policy, real estate prices soared, and the United States reached an unprecedented state of prosperity. However, artificial prosperity is, after all, a castle in the air. When his second term expired, the United States entered a great economic panic. Roosevelt's policies and ambitions are quite similar to Jackson's, although one is a clever politician and the other is a bold soldier. But the desire for greatness and the will to move forward are quite the same. In the next four years, Roosevelt may be doomed to repeat Jackson's fate.</p>
<h3>Chaos in Japanese Parliament, Hirota Leaves Without Finishing Speech</h3>
<p>Every Word Provokes Questions; Emperor Orders Parliament to Adjourn for Two Days</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Parliament opened today for the first time in the magnificent new hall. The whole nation is paying close attention. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] This afternoon, when Prime Minister Hirota was giving a speech in the House of Representatives, every word he uttered was met with questions, causing a noisy uproar. The speech could no longer be heard. The Prime Minister was very angry, packed up his documents, stepped down from the podium, and walked quickly out of the hall. Other cabinet members' speeches were also disrupted in the same way. Amidst jeers, there were shouts of "No, no." In particular, the most questions were raised during the speech by Finance Minister Baba. However, Baba ignored them and completed his speech. This morning, when the House of Peers met, the speeches of the cabinet members were very quiet, but no one expressed welcome. All the members of the House remained silent and listened quietly, without any cheers. (February 10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The imperial rescript to adjourn Parliament is as follows: I, in accordance with Article 7 of the Constitution of the Empire of Japan, order the Imperial Parliament to suspend its session for two days, from January 22nd to 23rd. Under the Imperial Seal, January 22nd, Showa 12th year, co-signed by various Ministers of State. (22nd Allied News dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hamada Attacks Military Interference in Politics, Causing a Great Disturbance</h3>
<p>Minister of the Army Considers it Insulting; Hamada Willing to Commit Seppuku as Apology; Military and Political Parties Hold Meetings</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives convened at 1:12 PM with the sound of the bell. The assembly hall and the public gallery were filled to capacity. Speaker Tomita, after various reports, announced the opening of the session at 2:10 PM. The Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Finance Minister each delivered speeches. When the Finance Minister reached the budget proposal, a Diet member shouted, "Know shame!" causing a commotion in the hall. The atmosphere became tense. At 2:40 PM, the financial speech concluded, and the first round of questioning began. Yukio Sakurauchi of the Rikken Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party) took the stage and stated to Prime Minister Hirota that the current cabinet's greatest mission lies in military discipline and the implementation of fresh governance, but its actual achievements are negligible, which is regrettable. Next, Kunimatsu Hamada of the Rikken Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government Party) took the stage to clarify the current cabinet's constitutional operation and the position of Japanese political parties in the constitution. He stated that the new system of military-civilian unity is unsuitable for the spirit of the constitution and fundamentally flawed in concept, explaining the harm of military interference in politics. He also said that Japan's industrial production has doubled since the Manchurian Incident, while the military budget has tripled, leading to high prices and threatening the lives of the people. Budget inefficiency is a natural consequence. The House of Representatives, which holds the power to deliberate the budget, should not be intimidated by any pressure in cultivating national economic strength, the so-called broad national defense, and should deliberate carefully. Under the political conscience, the budget and tax increase proposals should be dealt with appropriately to meet the demands of the people. As for the current deadlocked diplomatic issues, they are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Diplomatic relations with China are on the verge of complete collapse.</p>
<p>㊁ The Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty is in danger of not being ratified.</p>
<p>㊂ The Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany has caused many misunderstandings at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Regarding the truth of the stalemate in diplomatic relations with China, the government should first explain everything in detail to the people to maintain national diplomacy. The reason why the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty cannot be ratified is due to friction caused by the aftermath of the Japan-Germany Agreement, which is a publicly recognized fact. The conclusion of international treaties is the exercise of great power and should be approved by the Privy Council before ratification; otherwise, it is an insult to the country and a loss of national prestige. In accordance with Japan's unique national polity and the established path of constitutional responsibility, the current cabinet should take full responsibility for the failure to obtain ratification. This matter has a significant impact on the important task of assisting the Emperor and on national thought. The government should give a clear response with a solemn attitude, said Mr. Hamada, who concluded with a passionate shout, "Please abandon the military's sense of superiority," and then stepped down from the stage.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hirota replied that at the present time, there is considerable criticism of the military's driving force, strongly believing it is a fascist method, but now we respect political parties and hope for their assistance.</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Terauchi replied that it would be an illusion to say that there is a special tendency in Japan's political movements. It is regrettable that Mr. Hamada's arguments seem to criticize a part of the military, which violates the spirit of military-civilian unity.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Arita replied that Sino-Japanese negotiations have not reached a stalemate, and Sino-Japanese friendship has been a long-standing goal that has not yet been fully realized. To take a very small part of a long history and call it a failure is probably not a fair argument. There are various objections to the Japan-Germany Agreement, but it was unavoidable. The relationship between Japan and the United Kingdom is the same as in the era of the alliance, and there is no change. The Fisheries Treaty has not yet been signed and should not be used as an excuse. It is illegal for the Soviet Union to use it as an excuse, and I should not bear any responsibility.</p>
<p>Hamada took the stage again, stating that the Minister of the Army had said that his words insulted the Imperial Army, and asked again, demanding an immediate answer. The Minister of the Army said he was merely urging him to pay attention. Hamada then asked for the record to be checked quickly, saying that if it was found that he had made such remarks insulting the military, he would commit seppuku on the spot as an apology; if there were no such words, the Minister of the Army should take responsibility. After saying this, his face turned pale, and the assembly hall was filled with a somber atmosphere. The Minister of the Army replied that he would check later. The session adjourned at 6:20 PM. (Kyodo News, 21st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government believes that the atmosphere in both houses, especially the questions raised by Kunimatsu Hamada in the House of Representatives, is not only completely opposed to the government but also makes it difficult for the military, which is striving for military discipline, to tolerate, leading to strong opinions. Therefore, as a result of holding an emergency cabinet meeting after the Diet session adjourned, the Prime Minister proceeded to visit the Emperor, and the situation is rapidly becoming serious. (Kyodo News, 21st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding Mr. Kunimatsu Hamada's speech, the Army held a meeting of its leadership after the Diet session adjourned to discuss countermeasures. They will make a statement in the House of Representatives on the 22nd, believing that Hamada's speech clearly insulted the Imperial Army, which is difficult to condone, and for the sake of the Imperial Army's honor, it cannot be tolerated. The impact within the department is very large, so they will take a very strong attitude and plan to have the Minister of the Army ask Hamada to retract his remarks in the Diet on the 22nd. (Kyodo News, 21st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Navy held a meeting of its leadership in the government committee room in the Diet at 7:50 PM on the 21st. Attendees included Navy Minister Nagano, Vice Minister Yamamoto, and Director of Military Affairs Bureau Toyoda. They decided on the Navy's attitude toward Hamada's speech and held an important meeting. (Kyodo News, 21st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding Minister of the Army Terauchi's remarks about advising Hamada, etc., the Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government Party) considered it regrettable and held a meeting of its executives after the Diet session adjourned on the 21st. The results are as follows: Freedom of speech in the Diet should not be restricted as it would set a bad precedent, so it is inconvenient to remain silent. The Speaker should be informed and asked to request Minister of the Army Terauchi to retract his remarks. Their opinions on this matter have become unified and a meeting of executives will be held on the morning of the 22nd to make a final decision.</p>
<p>Also, Minseitō (Democratic Constitutional Party) President Machida invited both lower and upper house Diet members Sakurauchi and Koizumi and Secretary-General Nagai to his residence at 10:00 PM on the 21st to hold an important meeting of the leadership regarding the major changes in the political situation.

<h3>Japanese Military Again Issues Pamphlet</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of the Army today published a pamphlet explaining the justification for the huge military budget and the need for a powerful army, and made many criticisms of the major powers, especially Britain and Soviet Russia. It is said that Britain is interfering with Japan's "continental policy" everywhere and is clearly trying to undermine the establishment of peace in East Asia and the realization of Sino-Japanese friendship. The pamphlet continued that Japan must prepare because Soviet Russia's attitude of provocation is no longer concealable. As for the desires in the heart of the United States, it is actually trying to seize control of the Pacific Ocean and increase its position in the Chinese market, so the United States has recently been intensifying its efforts to increase its naval and defense forces in the Pacific. According to the Hochi Shimbun, the Japanese military is quite dissatisfied with the attitude of the two major political parties, the Minseitō (Democratic Constitutional Party) and the Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government Party), believing that the two major political parties are not at all concerned about the urgency of the current situation. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Arita Explains Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Continuing to Adjust Relations with China and Russia; Becoming Friendly with Germany and Italy and then Compromising with Britain and the United States</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The 70th Diet officially opened today, and the government and political parties began discussing national policy in the new Diet building at a time of extraordinary domestic and foreign affairs. The House of Peers convened at 10:00 AM, and Prime Minister Hirota first took the stage to deliver a speech explaining the government's policy direction, followed by the Foreign Minister's speech on diplomatic policy. After the two ministers' speeches, Watanabe Chika, representative of the research group, issued the first question to the government. The House of Representatives convened at 1:00 PM. After Prime Minister Hirota and Foreign Minister Arita spoke, Finance Minister Baba spoke on financial policy. Then Sakurauchi Yukio, representative of the Minseitō (Democratic Constitutional Party), was the vanguard in questioning and made a scathing criticism of the government's general problems in domestic and foreign affairs. (Kyodo News, 21st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Arita said in the Diet today, summarized as follows: Today I have the opportunity to state the outline of the Empire's diplomatic policy and its current situation in this House, which I consider an honor. The Empire's national policy, as stated in the special Diet in May of last year, is still to ensure stability in East Asia, to contribute to world peace, and at the same time to establish international justice to promote the welfare of mankind. Since then, we have been working diligently to achieve this goal and have never slackened.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Negotiations</p>
<p>The Empire's government, recognizing the importance of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, advocated the Three Principles for China, hoping to achieve the adjustment of the Chengdu Incident under this policy. Thereafter, the Bei Hai Incident and other unfortunate events continued to occur. We have always carefully considered these events. The resolution of these events themselves is necessary, but unless the fundamental cause is removed at the same time, it will be impossible to prevent their recurrence. It will be impossible to protect the safety of Japanese residents' lives and property and the Empire's rights and interests. From the beginning of September for more than three months, representatives of both sides negotiated repeatedly in Nanjing. As a result, both the Chengdu and Bei Hai incidents were resolved on December 30th. Although negotiations have not achieved the desired results, they are currently at a standstill, but I firmly believe that the negotiations to date have a significant meaning for the stage of future development. Japan's fundamental policy toward China is in Sino-Japanese cooperation and in coexistence and co-prosperity, which goes without saying. Therefore, I firmly believe that making new efforts and engaging in adjustment again is the duty of both governments and the hope of both nations. At the time of the Xi'an Incident, the government of the country observed the development of the situation quietly with a fair and upright attitude and great concern. Fortunately, it did not develop into a major incident and was brought under control, which is especially worthy of congratulation for the neighboring country. This matter, at the beginning, had the background of Zhang Xueliang advocating for accommodating communism and resisting Japan. Therefore, the beginning and end of this incident have a significant impact from the perspective of the overall situation in East Asia. Therefore, the Empire's government has been paying close attention to the trend of the incident.</p>
<p>Friendship with Italy</p>
<p>Previously, the Empire's government notified the Italian government of the intention to abolish the Empire's Legation in Afghanistan and establish a consulate. At the same time, the Italian government also stated that it would give friendly consideration to the protection of the Empire's commercial and other interests in Afghanistan. Currently, based on this intention, we are proceeding with discussions to conclude an agreement. This is nothing more than the Empire's government taking appropriate measures in consideration of the actual situation and the friendly relations with Italy.</p>
<p>Policy Toward Russia</p>
<p>The Empire's policy toward the Soviet Union is to establish and maintain normal relations, which goes without saying. The Empire's government believes that resolving various outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union is the way to improve good neighborly relations between the two countries. Therefore, from this perspective, last year we negotiated on the revision of the Fisheries Treaty, the determination of the "Manchukuo"-Soviet border, and the handling of disputes. At the same time, regarding the extension of the test drilling in Northern Sakhalin, we assisted the negotiations between the representatives of Japanese businesses and the Soviet government authorities.</p>
<p>Regarding the oil issue, last October, a contract was established between the representatives of Japanese businesses and the Soviet government authorities to extend the test drilling period for five years. Also, after a year and a half of negotiations, the new Fisheries Agreement had been finalized by mid-November of last year and was about to be signed. However, the Soviet government suddenly claimed that domestic procedures had not been completed and requested a postponement of the signing. Since then, it has not agreed to sign. Japan believes that the nature of the North Pacific fishing rights and the Fisheries Treaty that stipulates their exercise should not be interrupted and has repeatedly drawn the attention of the Soviet Union. As a result of negotiations, a temporary agreement was concluded on December 28th of last year to allow fishing this year to proceed smoothly. As for the negotiations on the signing of the agreement, they will naturally continue and we hope for a resolution. Also, the establishment of the "Manchukuo"-Soviet border demarcation and dispute resolution committee is considered to contribute greatly to preventing disputes between Japan, "Manchukuo" and the Soviet Union. It is also of great benefit to adjusting the national relations between the three countries. Therefore, from this point of view, it was promoted by Japan. On the issue of the principles of this matter, opinions have already been agreed on except for one or two points. The Empire's government strongly hopes that this issue can be resolved quickly.</p>
<p>The Empire's government is so committed to establishing peaceful relations with the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union not only maintains unbalanced military preparations on the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border, but even calls Japan's actions aggressive, which I deeply regret. I firmly believe that the Soviet Union must understand the Empire's peaceful intentions, reflect on its past attitude, and resolve the various issues between the two countries in order to normalize Japan-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>Japan-Manchukuo Relations</p>
<p>As I said in the previous Diet, the Empire's government will further promote the integration of the Japanese and "Manchukuo" people to further strengthen the inseparable good neighborly relationship between the two countries. For this reason, under the policy of abolishing extraterritoriality in "Manchukuo" and adjusting and even transferring the administrative rights of the South Manchuria Railway affiliated areas, the first stage was completed on June 10th of last year with the conclusion of the treaty with "Manchukuo" on abolishing part of extraterritoriality and adjusting the administrative rights of the South Manchuria Railway affiliated areas. Also, the economic relationship between Japan and "Manchukuo" is becoming increasingly close, which is especially worthy of celebration.</p>
<p>Toward Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Regarding Britain, the Empire's government's policy of strengthening the traditional relationship between Japan and Britain has not changed in the slightest. From the perspective of the overall situation of the two countries, Britain's position toward Japan, Japan's position toward Britain, and giving full sympathy to consideration, the conflict of interests of the two countries will naturally have a way to adjust, without any doubt. The Empire's government will make continuous efforts for this purpose.</p>
<p>The relationship with the United States has recently become increasingly good. This is partly due to the Empire's established policy of ensuring peace in the Pacific between Japan and the United States, and partly because the United States is gradually understanding the situation in East Asia. This friendly relationship should be further enhanced today.</p>
<p>International Trade</p>
<p>The Empire's government hopes to maintain close economic relations with the South Pacific region, but there are various slanders or misunderstandings about this hope. However, the Empire's government does not harbor any aggressive intentions, but only hopes to promote trade development and resource development by enhancing peaceful and friendly relations.</p>
<p>Although various restrictions are adopted by foreign countries on Japan's trade, the total amount reached an unprecedented high last year, which is enough to indicate the extraordinary vitality of Japan's economy and industry. However, this trend should not be relied upon for long. At this time of complex international economic situation, maintaining the stability of the original price depends a lot on the use of foreign exchange. At the end of last year, the government implemented revised ministerial ordinances based on the Foreign Exchange Control Law and, in view of the recent trends such as increased imports, sought temporary emergency measures. The government will pay attention to the international movement of ordinary capital in the future and will seek comprehensive measures to prevent capital flight and exchange rate fluctuations according to the situation. At the same time, in the actual management of exchange operations, it is intended to pay close attention to not giving obstacles to industry and trade.</p>
<p>Opening Up Markets</p>
<p>In addition to these diplomatic negotiations, the Empire's government is devoting all its efforts to maintaining and developing old markets and opening up new markets around the world in order to promote Japan's trade. In the special Diet last spring, it was said that the scope of measures that hinder international trade tends to expand. This is very important for countries like Japan, which have no choice but to secure the supply of raw materials and the sales of products overseas to maintain the national economy. Since then, there seems to have been a slight evidence of the easing of these restrictive measures, but the various restrictions to carry out this matter still exist. I firmly believe that what is most necessary at this time is for all countries to apply the spirit of fair treaties, such as the Congo Basin Treaty, in their colonial markets for the sake of realizing freedom of trade to a minimum. I believe that this, together with the recent study and realization of the problem of raw material resource allocation, is an effective and appropriate method for easing the world's anxiety and contributing to peace. Cultural Projects</p>
<p>Finally, I have one thing to say about cultural projects. The culture of a country is the expression of its national character. Understanding it is to fundamentally recognize the country, and then can establish international justice and realize true international cooperation. Especially for countries like Japan with the oldest special culture, it is a necessary act to promote it to the world in a big way so that the world can fully understand Japan's active spirit. Therefore, the government is making more efforts in this business from this point of view.</p>
<p>The above is the government's diplomatic policy and the outline of recent diplomatic progress. Under the current complex and subtle domestic and foreign situation, we must carefully deal with the many difficulties encountered by the Empire without a gap between the government and the public in order to avoid mistakes. This goes without saying. For the implementation of national policy, I firmly believe that we must unite the country and pay full attention to it. This is what I sincerely hope for your continuous cooperation. (Kyodo News, 21st)</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Hirota's Policy Speech</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The first day of the House of Peers convened at 10:16 AM. Prime Minister Hirota began by giving a policy speech, the main points of which are as follows: Looking at the domestic and foreign situation of the Empire, there are many problems at home, such as thought, national defense, industry, economy, finance, education, and others, lying before us. Abroad, the world situation is chaotic and unclear. The international political situation surrounding the Empire is becoming increasingly subtle, and various foreign problems are becoming more complex. Therefore, we must be aware that the Empire's future has many difficulties lying before us. In order to eliminate these difficulties and promote the expansion of national fortune, we must declare the Empire's lofty mission to the world so that it has a correct understanding. Domestically, we must thoroughly plan various facilities and operations, and achieve the reality of reforming all kinds of governance in order to strengthen national power. The foundation lies in the bright and glorious concept of the national polity, so that various domestic and foreign policies are integrated with it seamlessly, and we revitalize the national spirit. With the Japanese Imperial Family as the center, the determination of national unity, unity, and indomitability is the sincerity of its tempering. This is the basic tone of the government's support for the justice of revitalizing the country. The Empire's diplomatic policy is consistent with the above-mentioned mission of the Empire and has never changed. Based on the above-mentioned fundamental policy, the government will further strengthen the special inseparable relationship with "Manchukuo," and from the perspective of ensuring the status as a force for stability in East Asia and maintaining permanent peace in East Asia, it firmly believes that it is necessary to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. Therefore, we strive to achieve the reality of good neighborliness and cooperation. Next, I would like to state the important policies that the current cabinet intends to realize in connection with the Showa 12 fiscal year budget. Based on the policies stated at the 69th Imperial Diet last spring, we have been diligently working to concretize the policies. As a result, the government has decided to enrich national defense and other seven specific policies. For the sake of implementation, the necessary budget bill and law bill will be submitted to this Diet. It was also said in the previous Diet that there are many things that should be improved in general governance, but in view of the current domestic and foreign situation and the current state of finance, we will concentrate on the most urgent matters that must be realized in any case. Let me describe them separately:</p>
<p>㊀ Enriching national defense,</p>
<p>㊁ Refreshing and improving education,</p>
<p>㊂ Reorganizing the central and local tax systems,</p>
<p>㊃ Stabilizing national life,</p>
<p>㊄ Promoting industry and expanding trade,</p>
<p>㊅ Establishing important national policies for Manchuria,</p>
<p>㊆ Reorganizing and improving the administrative structure. (Domei News Agency, 21st)</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Baba's Speech on Finance</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The gist of Finance Minister Baba's speech is as follows:</p>
<p>The budget for Showa 12 is a considerable increase compared to the previous year, and temporary expenses related to national policies will still need to be added in the future, so the expansion of bonds will inevitably continue for the time being. This time, for the above situation, there are plans to increase taxes and other revenue increases, and there are also regular annual revenue increases. Therefore, the total amount of public bonds issued in the next few years will be roughly the same as the total amount in the 12th fiscal year. After that, the number of public bonds is expected to gradually decrease. Taking this opportunity, I will briefly explain the government's financial and economic policies. In order to expect sound development of industry and trade and to reduce the financial burden on the entire nation, the government has been observing the actual situation of the financial world and implementing a low-interest policy since the cabinet was formed, and the government continues to hope that low interest will gradually proceed. Also, from May 1st to September 15th of last year, it borrowed five-percent national treasury bonds totaling more than 2.1 billion yen and used three-and-a-half-percent national treasury bonds. However, the government intends to temporarily maintain the current interest rate level for national debt, and it is also planned to implement borrowing and lowering interest rates on the remaining five-percent and four-and-a-half-percent public bonds of more than 2.9 billion yen at an appropriate time. The total amount of foreign trade last year, including domestic and foreign imports and exports, reached more than 5.725 billion yen, indicating a new record for Japan's trade market, which can be considered smooth. However, this trend should not be relied upon for long. At this time of complex international economic situation, maintaining the stability of the original price requires the use of foreign exchange. At the end of last year, the government implemented revised ministerial ordinances based on the Foreign Exchange Control Law, and in view of recent trends such as increased imports, sought temporary emergency measures. The government will pay attention to the international movement of ordinary capital in the future and will seek comprehensive measures to prevent capital flight and exchange rate fluctuations according to the situation. At the same time, in the actual management of exchange operations, it is intended to pay close attention to not giving obstacles to industry and trade. (Domei News Agency, 21st)</p>

<p>Chicago: The United Committee of Five Railroad Unions, with a total membership of 300,000, agreed today to immediately demand a 20% increase in wages. If this is implemented, it will cost a total of 116 million yuan per year. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<h3>England and France Agree on Negotiation Policy Towards Germany</h3>
<p>Economic Aid Must Not Expand Armaments; German Newspapers Also Say They Are Willing to Cooperate with All Countries</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden went to Geneva yesterday, then to Paris, and had talks with French Prime Minister Léon Blum. Political figures here have received a telegram from Paris, learning that the two sides have agreed that any future economic and financial assistance to Germany must be subject to two conditions: ① Other countries in need of assistance should enjoy the same treatment as Germany; ② This assistance, under no circumstances, should be used to expand armaments. Political figures have expressed satisfaction with this news. Moreover, since French Minister of National Defense Daladier was also present at yesterday's talks, it is believed that the gradual reduction of armaments by all countries and the publication of military budgets were also discussed together. However, it is doubtful whether this can lead to a concrete compromise with Germany. According to news from Berlin, Germany is unwilling to consider any plan that requires Germany to change its current policies, methods, and objectives to solve general European problems. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>[Berlin] German newspapers have commented on Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the House of Commons. They expressed agreement with Eden's statement that the only way to solve the Spanish problem is through "Spaniards for Spain." However, they expressed regret that the Foreign Secretary failed to clarify whether Britain is willing to use its influence to rebuild Spanish sovereignty. Regarding Eden's advice to Germany, the newspapers believe that Germany has always expressed its willingness to cooperate with all countries, as evidenced by numerous proposals. However, cooperation must be limited to countries that strive for public well-being. The newspapers also agree that Eden sees trust as a prerequisite for cooperation, and they say that the German people must be given the opportunity to develop trust, so that they can trust their former enemies who now harbor good intentions. Regarding Eden's proposal to realize international cooperation within the framework of the League of Nations, the newspapers expressed distrust. They believe that the collectivism of Geneva cannot eliminate the world's disputes, and that the agreements made behind the scenes of the League of Nations not only cannot eliminate the unease in Europe, but can actually increase it. It is better for Germany to build a system of direct friendly relations, which can achieve practical results and improve the European situation. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>[Rome] It was learned today that the attitudes of Italy and Germany towards the European situation have become increasingly clear since General Göring's meeting with Mussolini. It is said that Italy is willing to cooperate with the European powers, but this cooperation must not include Soviet Russia. The conditions must be different from those of the past two years, as the Four-Power Pact is now a thing of the past, and the so-called Stresa Front has been shattered and can never be used again.

<h3>President Roosevelt Continues to Seek Welfare for the Poor During His Second Term</h3>
<p>He Braved Rain and Snow with the People at His Inaugural Speech; The Presidential Palace Only Served Tea and Snacks to Guests</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt solemnly declared today that the government will continue to seek improved living conditions for the more than 40 million underprivileged Americans, and then began his second term as president. When President Roosevelt delivered his speech, he stood bareheaded in the rain and snow. There was originally bulletproof glass protecting the platform, but Roosevelt ordered it to be removed, saying, "If everyone can brave this rain and snow, why can't I?" He was sworn in by Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court, and other judges were also present, but Stone was ill and Brandeis was too weak to attend. Before the president arrived, Mrs. Roosevelt, seeing that the judges were all elderly, ordered the White House attendants to bring in robes to keep them warm. The oath was taken at 12:29 p.m. According to the Constitution, the president must take office at noon, so today the United States had 29 minutes without a president in legal terms. When the president arrived, he originally rode in a sedan, but seeing the crowds standing in the rain, he returned to the White House and changed to an open car, so that his wife's new hat was also ruined by the rain and snow. Later, when the president reviewed the parade, he had already changed out of his wet clothes. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt was sworn in, delivered a speech, and attended two tea parties at the White House, and went to bed early tonight. Today, before the president held the inauguration ceremony, he invited more than 700 dignitaries from all walks of life to the White House for tea and snacks, which included cold meat sandwiches, ice cream, and coffee. After the army marched in the heavy rain through the streets and past the presidential platform, another 3,000 people went to the White House for tea and snacks. The president attended both tea parties for a short time, but Mrs. Roosevelt was very gracious in her hospitality. Although it rained heavily today, the president still held the oath ceremony in the open-air speech platform outside the Capitol, refusing to hold it inside the Capitol. The president pointed to the 50,000 people watching the ceremony outside the Capitol, soaked to the skin, and said, "They can endure the heavy rain, so can I." The president's mother and his sons and grandsons all attended the inauguration ceremony today. Four generations participating in the grand ceremony is the first time in American history. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The political, financial, and commercial circles of the country all expect today that the natural result of President Roosevelt's inaugural speech is that the government will exert pressure to achieve administrative goals. Although the president did not vigorously attack speculation, the reflection on Wall Street was that all prices rose. However, there is no doubt that the president is determined to lead the government and promote the social and economic plan of the New Deal philosophy. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>

On the 14th of this month, the Japanese General Staff Headquarters dispatched subordinate Watanabe Zokyo to Tianjin to convey the diplomatic intentions and the working principles that the heads of various special service agencies should abide by this year. The headquarters of the Japanese garrison in North China has not yet conveyed this to the heads of special service agencies in various places.

<h3>Tragic Incident of a Passenger Train on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Being Burned Midway</h3>
<p>Seventy-six Passengers Burned to Death; Four Died from Falls and Twenty-seven Were Injured; All Three Third-Class Passenger Cars Were Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway train runs several times a day, and the places it passes through are all prosperous towns in Dongjiang. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 16th of this month, an unprecedented tragic train burning incident occurred, burning 76 passengers to death and injuring more than 20 people, destroying three passenger cars and causing a loss of more than 200,000 yuan. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Horrific Fire Scene</p>
<p>On the 16th of this month, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway midday express train departed from Kowloon, Hong Kong, at 12:30 p.m. Because it was Saturday, many people from Hong Kong took the train to Guangzhou for sightseeing, and as the Lunar New Year was approaching, travel between Hong Kong and Guangdong was frequent, so the number of passengers on that day was more crowded than usual. The train consisted of ten cars, including first-class, second-class, and third-class cars. The five third-class passenger cars were closest to the engine, followed by two second-class passenger cars, and the two first-class passenger cars were at the rear. There were no fewer than four or five hundred passengers in each car, and the third-class cars had the most passengers. After the train departed from Kowloon, it stopped briefly at the Shilong station in the Huaxian section at 3 p.m. and then departed again. Less than ten minutes after the train started, a ball of white smoke was suddenly found near the toilet in the third third-class passenger car in the front, and it scattered with the wind. Before long, flames shot out from the thick smoke, and the car was already on fire. According to eyewitnesses, the fire started in a basket of chemical plastic toys weighing about 40 kilograms. At that time, the smell of smoke was pungent and unapproachable. Another theory is that smugglers were secretly transporting explosive items (such as silver powder and white medicine), which caught fire due to impact from the movement of the car. (Note: The two theories have not yet been determined, and the authorities are still investigating. This is because most of the victims in the car at that time were killed, and the injured may not have been eyewitnesses.) After the third car in the front caught fire, the engine was moving forward and it was not easy to detect, so the fire took advantage of the wind and spread to the second and fourth passenger cars adjacent to the third car. The male and female passengers in the three cars had no way to escape, regardless of the chain of burning ships, and the engine at the front was still running with the wind. The passengers in the three cars were at a loss, and when they were exhausted, the fire was already imminent, so they died together. Some jumped out of the car windows to escape, but the engine still did not stop, and they broke their heads and limbs as soon as they jumped down. It was better to die by jumping out of the car, and there was no hope of survival if they did not escape. The cruelty was beyond description. In the blink of an eye, the engine passed the bend, and the driver looked back at the passenger cars and saw thick smoke coming out. At the same time, the road staff also warned with flags, and then the car stopped abruptly, but the three passenger cars had been reduced to ashes. The passengers in the neighboring car could only hear the miserable cries, but the train stopped in the wilderness below Shilihua station, with no one around, and there was no way to find rescue personnel. The stationmaster of Shilihua station, a man named Mai, urgently telegraphed the Shilong station and the Guangzhou Dashatou Railway Bureau, asking them to quickly send a rescue team to rescue the dead and injured.</p>
<p>Collecting Corpses and Rescuing the Injured</p>
<p>After hearing the news, the Railway Bureau immediately sent the head of the Transportation Section, the head of the Medical Department, and other staff members, along with more than ten members of the Guangfang Bianyi Hospital rescue team, to the scene of the accident by special train to rescue. First, they rescued and treated more than 20 passengers who were burned, and transported the burned vehicles back to Shilong to facilitate the resumption of traffic on the railway tracks. It was not until about 9 p.m. on the evening of the 16th that the injured were transported back to Guangzhou and sent to Bianyi Hospital, the Municipal Hospital, and Liangguang Hospital for treatment. A total of 27 men and women were admitted to the hospital. In addition, Zhang Mingjun, Guan Ba, Kong Youqiu, Kong Youxian, Chen Yuan, Guan Ba, Huang Li, and seven others were treated and discharged home because their injuries were not serious. Among the remaining 27 people, Zhang Yao died in the hospital the next day due to serious injuries. The Bianyi Hospital corpse collection team went to the scene of the accident again by special list on the morning of the 17th to collect corpses from the burned cars. Most of the corpses were cremated, leaving only skull heads or incomplete limbs, or only a bundle of withered bones. In fact, the corpses were no longer identifiable. The parties collected them, photographed the skeletal bones, and attached the deceased's belongings. A total of 72 remains were collected, and a pile of other mixed bones, amounting to several people. In addition, two male corpses and two female corpses were found by the roadside, who died from jumping out of the car. Only these four corpses were complete, and they were immediately wrapped in mats and transported to the province by car, unloaded near the stadium above Taishatou Station, and then transported by freight car to the Gao Gang beside Bianyi Hospital on Changgeng Road, where the hospital officially announced that there were 76 male and female corpses, inviting relatives to identify them.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Injured</p>
<p>Those sent to Guangzhou and hospitalized in Guanghua Hospital include Xie Baohua from Longchuan County, Li Youqing from Nanhai, Yang Chuang from Zhongshan, Zhang Yao from Zhongshan (died on the 17th), Cen Lianhao (female) from Baoan County, Yang Qihong from Xinhui, Zhou Mingyou from Gaoyao, Yuan Mankai from Zhongshan, an unnamed person (male) who has died of serious injuries, Chen Ye from Sanshui, Guo Zhong from Zengcheng, Chen Yuan from Nanhai, Guan Ba from Nanhai, Kong Boqiu from Nanhai, Kong Zhaoguang from Nanhai, Zhang Mingjun from Nanhai, and Huang Li from Panyu.

<p>Aftermath News</p>
<p>① The above corpses were burned to charcoal, with incomplete limbs and unrecognizable faces. Even if there are relatives of the corpses to claim them, it is impossible to identify them. Only seven were claimed on the 18th, and the rest could not be claimed. Therefore, the parties plan to build a public cemetery for mass burial, recording the cause of the incident, so that the relatives of the missing can pay their respects. ② The Railway Bureau, because the cause of the fire is uncertain, initiated the organization of an inquiry committee, and designated the Chinese and British directors of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau, the heads of the Transportation Department, the heads of the Road Maintenance Department, the heads of the Mechanical Department, and the general section chiefs to study the cause of the accident. ③ After the tragic incident occurred, the Railway Bureau has purchased dozens of coffins and entrusted Bianyi Hospital to bury the corpses that have not been claimed first, to avoid prolonged exposure. ④ For the sake of the aftermath, the Railway Bureau ordered that fire extinguishers and fire-fighting equipment be added to the cars in the future, and that passenger quotas be restricted and smuggling be strictly cracked down on.</p>
<p>Summary of Losses</p>
<p>The property lost by the victims this time is estimated at more than 10,000 yuan. One debt collector was said to have had more than 20,000 yuan in Hong Kong currency in his pocket, which was also burned. There was also a family of eight who came to the province in the same car. Only one child survived, and the other seven were buried in the fire pit. Three third-class passenger cars were destroyed, each worth about 30,000 yuan, and the Railway Bureau lost a total of 100,000 yuan. In addition, the railway tracks were destroyed by the fire, causing a loss of about 1,000 yuan. Fortunately, the railway tracks were not seriously damaged. After slight repairs, the trains on the 18th operated normally without obstruction. The income of the Railway Bureau was not greatly affected. (January 19th)</p>
<h3>Total Value of Seasonal Fruit Production in Fujian Province Last Year</h3>
<p>Olives and Fortune Oranges Account for the Majority; Export Value Totals More Than One Million</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: Fuzhou's seasonal fruit production is dominated by olives and fortune oranges. Olive species are further divided into two types: one is Sandalwood, which is small in size and fragrant, and has a higher value; the other is Changying, which is round and large, and can be used for pickling and soaking in honey. It is transported from Fujian to various ports in Shanghai and Tianjin, and the sales are very large. The annual sales amount is about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Since the Guangdong Army returned to Guangzhou from Fujian in the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922), they brought olive seeds from Fujian to Guangdong to plant, and now there is production. Taiwan also has Fujian species, and exports have been made in recent years, but the quality is not as good as that produced in Fujian Province. Last year, the olives in Fujian Province fell due to the wind, and production decreased. Exports were only more than 30,000 parts, worth more than 300,000 yuan, a decrease of half compared to the past. Fortune oranges are well-known in Shanghai, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other ports, and are important goods for winter sales. The annual production is more than one million yuan. Last year's production was very strong, and the weather in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places was also very sunny, and sales were very good. However, the selling price could not improve, and it was difficult for operators to profit. More than 5,000 pieces have been exported last year, and they are still being exported one after another. By the end of the season, the combined amount can reach more than 10,000 pieces. After this, the Guang oranges produced in Chaozhou and Shantou have already fallen out of season, and the selling price of fortune oranges is expected to increase slightly.</p>
<h3>Inauguration of the New Building for the Hangzhou Southeast Daily</h3>
<p>Inauguration Ceremony Held on February 1st</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: The Hangzhou Southeast Daily, since its publication, has only been around for a little over two years, but it has gained significant reputation. Its circulation area covers Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Fujian, Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other important cities. There are also many readers in Europe, America, and Japan.

<h3>Corpses and Coffins Robbed by Bandits in Songjiang</h3>
<p>In Taipingfang, Fengjing Town, at the Shen Si Yi Hall, there was a deceased Sun woman who had passed away for more than ten years. At the time of her elaborate funeral, gold, silver, and jewelry were all hidden inside the coffin, which was widely talked about among the townspeople. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 7th, during heavy snowfall, bandits learned that the Sun family's coffin was stored in the North Gate mortuary. They broke into the mortuary, which housed four coffins in total. The bandits only broke open the Sun family's coffin and stole one gold scepter, one silver teapot, one silver cup, and jewelry ornaments. The corpses were left in a messy state. The bandits fled with the stolen goods. The mortuary manager immediately reported the incident to the Second Sub-bureau for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Qian Dajun of Kunshan Returns Home to Recuperate</h3>
<p>Qian Dajun, the director of the Military Affairs Commission's Office of the Attendant, after being injured in the Xi'an Incident, went to Shanghai for treatment on December 28th of last year. He has now recovered. Around 7:00 AM on the 20th, he, along with Madam Ouyang and attendants, traveled in three private cars from Shanghai to his hometown in Zhengyi Waijing Village for a short rest. He is expected to go to Nanjing in about three to four months.</p>
<h3>A Post and Telegraph Office Established at Twelve Forts in Changshu</h3>
<p>Twelve Forts Port in Shazhou City, in this county, borders the Yangtze River and is adjacent to Nantong. It is also one of the most remote major towns in the county's jurisdiction. However, due to transportation issues, travel to and from there is particularly inconvenient. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation specially added a post and telegraph office and a long-distance telephone bureau there. Because there are ferries passing through the area every day and there are many passengers, the installation of telephone poles at the bureau is nearly complete. It is scheduled to officially open on February 1st, making transportation in that area more convenient from now on.</p>
<h3>Accusation Against the Director of the Land Administration Bureau in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Qiu Zixian and others, members of the Wu County party, stated that Chen Shufeng, a resident of Yinma Town in the urban area, submitted several real estate deeds to the Wu County Land Administration Bureau for registration in September of last year. On the 8th of this month, Chen presented the receipt to the Land Administration Bureau to retrieve the deeds. The bureau claimed that they had been fraudulently claimed by someone on the 5th, and the fraudulent receipt was stamped with the bureau's seal and the registration office's small seal. Chen immediately hired lawyer Cai Chenglu to send a letter to the Land Administration Bureau, requesting a reply within three days, but it was ignored. Subsequently, a warning letter was also ignored. Now, legal solutions are being prepared. Such a situation is inevitably detrimental to the property rights of the people. Therefore, on the 21st, they jointly submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau, requesting the removal and punishment of the bureau director, Dong Zhongsheng, the urban area registration director, Sun Qi, and the document custodian, Wei, in order to maintain official integrity.</p>
<p>Managing the Temple Property of Lianchi Nunnery</p>
<p>Lianchi Nunnery on Wufeng Mountain in Mu'du Township is one of the ancient temples in Wu County. The temple is quite popular with pilgrims. Because the abbot of the nunnery, Kuanlu, did not abide by the monastic rules, the county government ordered his expulsion. Afterwards, many people recommended successors to the government. County Magistrate Deng found it difficult to handle, so he requested local figures, such as Li Yinquan, to organize a management committee for the temple property and have the committee select the abbot. The committee has already decided to rotate the management among five people: Pukai from Tianchi Mountain Jiji Nunnery, Miaozhen from Lingyan Mountain Chongbao Nunnery, and others, with each rotation lasting one year. Previously, Yang Zengxiang and others had submitted a petition to the county government to recommend Yinhuai as the abbot of the nunnery, but the county government disapproved it on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Telegraph to the Province from Wuxi Regarding the Handling of Major Bandits</h3>
<p>Duan Qishan, the captain of the detective team of the Public Security Bureau of this county, led detectives on the 14th of this month and arrested six major bandits from the Su gang, including Cai Youxiang, Fei Jingen, Zhou Jinsheng, Zhou Fuchu, Zhou Tangshi, and Zhou Lushi, at No. 30 Ying'anli, Yinglong Town, outside the West Gate. After bringing them back to the bureau, they were strictly interrogated. Cai confessed to robbing the Zhang Miao's house, Huang Xincai's house, and a certain family in Lingyan Mountain, Suzhou, without denial. Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau considered that these criminals had repeatedly committed armed robberies in the villages of Suzhou and Wuxi, showing utter disregard for the law. It was decided on the 22nd to transfer them to the county government for review and handling. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the provincial authorities, requesting that they be dealt with according to the law and requesting the authorities to cooperate in arresting the fugitives, bringing them to justice for interrogation.</p>
<p>Completing the Tax Collection Door-to-Door</p>
<p>The county government of this county began collecting the second installment of the 25th year's land tax as early as December 1st. Initially, very few businesses came to the counter to pay. With only nine days left until the initial deadline, County Magistrate Long issued a handwritten order to all tax collectors and Tu Zheng (local officials) to diligently complete the collection. On the 20th and 21st, the collection amount increased slightly, with more than 10,000 yuan collected each day. The tax quota for this year is 60%, approximately 600,000 yuan. More than 100,000 yuan has already been collected. How can the full amount be collected within this initial deadline? It is because the Yitu (community map) of this county has already been completed, with a total of more than 140 Yitu established. Each Yitu is responsible for door-to-door collection by the Jia Zhu (heads of the villages), sweeping away the amount in one go.</p>
<h3>Three Cars Fall into the River in Haizhou</h3>
<p>At 11 AM on the 18th, a chartered bus from United Motors was returning from Yangji to Guanyun County. When it passed the Shanhou River, the car had just driven onto the ferry when, due to the slippery gangplank after the snow, it plunged into the center of the river, sinking into the mud. Only a foot or so of the car's hood was visible above the water. For the price of 20 yuan, four cows were hired to pull the car up. At 3 PM that afternoon, a chartered bus from Lianyungang Motor Company was coming from Xiangshui Port and also had to cross the river. The car had already boarded the ferry, and when it was ferrying to the north bank, the car drove towards the dock and also slid into the river due to the slippery mud. The company used a large truck, tied with ropes, and invited more than 40 villagers to help push and pull, finally dragging the car up. At 5 PM in the evening, another chartered bus from Public Welfare Motors came from Yangji and passed the ferry crossing of the river. Again, due to the slippery mud on the dock, it plunged into the river. It cost ten yuan to hire six cows from farmers to drag the car ashore. One of the car wheels was damaged.</p>
<h3>Two Robbers Executed in Funing</h3>
<p>The Tongyuxiang store in Dongkan Town, this county, was robbed some days ago, and two policemen from the Public Security Sub-bureau were shot and injured. Two rifles were seized. The national army stationed in the town captured the main offenders, Pan Keyou and Li Fusheng, who were carrying box guns and had seized the police officers' guns, as well as two suspects. After interrogation, a telegram was sent to the Qingjiang Headquarters for review. On the 19th, the order was received to impose the death penalty. That morning, the criminals Pan Keyou and Li Fusheng were identified, tied up, and taken to the east and west streets of Dongkan to be beheaded as a warning to the public.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Boat Association Requests to Establish an Office</h3>
<p>The Huo Jia Bridge Ferry in the Second District of Jiangdu often has disputes over the loading and unloading of goods and dock workers. The Datong and Dada companies do not have anyone stationed at the port to be responsible for the delivery. The Sucheng County Civilian Boat Industry Workers' Union, recognizing that these companies have no one responsible and that there are disputes over the handling of goods, has established an office in Huoqiao to specifically handle the delivery of goods. On the 19th, they submitted a petition to the Jiangdu County Government, stating the reasons and requesting to be put on file.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce Organizes Training Classes</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, in light of the government's announcement that income tax collection will be implemented from the New Year's Day of this year, believes that old-fashioned account books urgently need improvement to make it easier for government tax collectors to audit and to avoid disputes. The Chamber has decided to first organize two classes: an accountant training class and a general store clerk training course, with classes and lectures held day and night. It has recently sent letters to the relevant trade associations, forwarding the information to all merchants.</p>
<h3>Severe Bandit Disaster in Taishun County, Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Taishun County, on the border of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, has been disturbed by bandits since September of the 23rd year, when Fujian bandits Fan Tiemin and Fan Yisheng and their gangs raided.

<h3>All Blacks Lost to Xin Team Yesterday</h3>
<p>60 to 43; First Half 34 to 8</p>
<p>There were a total of three basketball matches at Shen Garden yesterday. The first was between Mailing B of Group A Section B against Liangxi. Mailing was initially very aggressive, leading by as many as 20 points in the first half with a score of 27 to 17. In the second half, Liangxi chased hard, while Mailing seemed discouraged, missing all free throws. As a result, Liangxi scored one point more than Mailing at the end, with a score of 10 to 9. However, due to the large deficit in the first half, Liangxi ultimately lost to Mailing by 36 to 17. The second match was between Jingwu and Fuzhong of Group B Section II. Fuzhong was in poor condition after taking the court and was no match for Jingwu's skillful play, falling behind 9 to 15 in the first half. During the break, Fuzhong's coach, Mr. Han Kuiyong, came to the court despite being ill to provide guidance. Indeed, his advice worked wonders, and after the restart, Fuzhong looked completely renewed. The score also rose rapidly, increasing by eight points in one breath, surpassing Jingwu by 17 to 15. Jingwu repeatedly attempted to catch up, making the situation even more tense. However, after a distant shot, Fuzhong ultimately prevailed with wisdom, reversing the loss by 33 to 24. The last match was between the Xin team and the All Blacks of Group A Section A. Both sides belonged to the same group, showing great politeness during the match. After the exchange, the Xin team first scored. Lu Zhongen missed his shot, but Feng Nianhua made both free throws, scoring four points. Chen Xianglong made two layups, and Lu Zhongen also made one, increasing the score to 10 to 0. The All Blacks missed many shots and appeared flustered. It was not until Xu Jusheng made a layup under the basket that they opened the score. However, the Xin team's Feng Nianhua and Qian Jingyong added three more baskets, and Yuan Shangrang broke the basket, making it 4 to 16. But Qian Jingyong retaliated in the same way. Zhang Shaoqing made a free throw, and Lu Zhongyu and Chen Xianglong also scored continuously, making it 22 to 5, further widening the gap. Before long, the All Blacks' Xu Jusheng and Zhang Shaoqing made one free throw and one field goal, adding three points. But the Xin team's shots were like a string of beads, reaching 34 to 8 in an instant. The first half ended there. After the break, the Xin team replaced Qian Jingyong with Sun Huimin, but soon Qian returned to the court, replacing Lu Zhongyu. The momentum of the All Blacks increased, and Xu Jusheng scored two baskets. Gu Shangrang also made two free throws, adding six points in one breath, reducing the score to 14 to 34. The difference was now only half. After Chen Xianglong made a basket, Jia Youliang and Xu Xilin made two more major contributions, making it 18 to 36, with the difference now only four points. Compared to 34 to 8 in the first half, the situation was completely different. Later, the Xin team's momentum became active again. After Xianglong and Shaoqing each made a basket, Chen added two more, and Jia Youliang scored, making it 57 to 37. The Xin team suddenly took the lead by 20 points again. Later, the All Blacks' Xu and Zhang rallied, and the Xin team also scored slightly. Until Qian Jingyong made a free throw, it ended with a score of 60 to 43. The Xin team ultimately won due to their lead in the first half. Therefore, although the second half ended with a score of 26 to 35, with the All Blacks surpassing them, they still won the victory. The results of each match are as follows:</p>
<p>Mailing B defeated Liangxi (A B) 36 to 17</p>

<p>The basketball team formed by the Shanghai Chinese Sports Referee Association played a friendly match against the US Navy's Mailing H team at the China Youth Gymnasium yesterday.

At the end of the first half, the referee team was behind with a score of 21 to 18. In the third quarter, the referee team once surpassed the lead with a score of 36 to 32. Not long after the start of the fourth quarter, Li Feiyun withdrew due to an eye injury. However, each member had duties last night, so only five people arrived, leaving them with no substitutes to fight with four people.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Improves Overseas Chinese School Subjects</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 21st) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission believes that the curricula of overseas Chinese schools are inconsistent. For example, in overseas Chinese schools in the Philippines, Chinese is taught in the morning and English in the afternoon. The same course is taught in both Chinese and English, which is very inappropriate. In the Dutch East Indies, Dutch laws and regulations are used, and the Malay language is used for trade and communication between various ethnic groups. However, while overseas Chinese schools have a foreign language subject, they only teach English and completely ignore Dutch and Malay. This is impractical and incomprehensible. The Commission has instructed all consulates to instruct their affiliated overseas Chinese schools to make practical improvements and formulate teaching subjects for overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools, taking into account the revised primary and secondary school curriculum tables of the Ministry of Education and the actual needs of various overseas Chinese communities.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Investigates and Compiles Statistics on Private Schools Throughout the City</h3>
<p>There are a total of 452 private schools in the urban area, and teachers will be trained after registration.</p>
<p>(Note) The Pusan District has not yet been surveyed. The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to rectify and improve the private schools in this city, launched a general survey of private schools throughout the city starting on the 23rd of last month and began a general registration of private school teachers throughout the city starting on the 20th of this month. The results of the survey and the rectification plan are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>General Situation: The survey only covered the urban area, and the result was a total of 452 private schools. Each school has only one teacher, so the number is also 452. Men account for the vast majority, with only six female teachers. Among the male teachers, those from Jiangbei account for the majority. Most of them are over 40 years old. There are more than 10,000 students in total, with the Zhabei District having the most. The schools are mostly located in straw sheds, with no equipment other than tables and chairs. The school year is different from ordinary schools. It is divided into three terms based on the lunar calendar: New Year to Dragon Boat Festival is the first term, Dragon Boat Festival to Mid-Autumn Festival is the second term, and Mid-Autumn Festival to the end of the year is the third term. The tuition fee is at most seven yuan per student per term and at least one yuan. The average is two or three yuan. The highest income is 600 yuan per school per year (excluding tutors). The curriculum focuses on Chinese language, calligraphy, and abacus calculation. The Analects of Confucius, Mencius, and the Four Books and Five Classics are everywhere. Classes are quite casual. Students can freely enter and leave during class time. Clothes do not need to be neat, and tuition fees can be paid in installments, so most parents are willing to send their children to private schools. Most of the teachers are from private school backgrounds, and few have graduated from schools.</p>
<p>Registration Begins: The Social Affairs Bureau believes that private schools are so corrupt as a result of the survey, so it immediately organized a general registration of private school teachers in order to gradually improve the situation. Registration started on the 20th. Registrants must bring two two-and-a-half-inch half-length photos, go to the bureau in person to fill out the registration form, and take an oral test. The registration has been very enthusiastic in the past two days and will end on February 10th. After the registration is completed, a training center for private school teachers will be established to seek thorough rectification.</p>

<h3>Liu Haisu Requests Allocation of Boxer Indemnity Funds to Promote Art</h3>
<p>In the past, the use of the interest from the British-returned Boxer Indemnity funds has mostly focused on the encouragement of science, and little attention has been paid to art. When Mr. Liu Haisu exhibited his paintings in the UK, he discussed the issue of Sino-British cultural exchange with prominent figures in the British art world such as Laurence Binyon, Roth, and Yeats. Both sides believed that it was necessary to seek progress urgently. Therefore, after Liu returned to China, he repeatedly consulted with the persons in charge of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee, advocating that the use of the interest in the future should also focus on the encouragement of art and learning. Now that the meeting of the committee is approaching, he has sent another letter suggesting this.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>The bulls are making a comeback to maintain the recent rise in cotton yarn prices.</p>
<p>The forward prices have also been pulled up a lot. However, the current selling prices of yarn are falling one after another.</p>
<p>The yarn market was sluggish in the morning but rose in the afternoon, and the momentum turned strong. This is because the delivery period for this month is approaching, and it is rumored that there are 3,000 to 5,000 bales for delivery. However, the buyers are also strong and are prepared to collect as much as possible. At the same time, the absorption of the February contract has not been abandoned. The near-term prices are rising, and the far-term prices are soaring. However, the current yarn trading is very depressed. The total transaction volume for the whole day is less than 300 bales, and the selling prices are falling one after another.</p>
<p>Large February yarn buyers continue to drag. In the opening market for standard yarn, the rise in Osaka Sampin yarn continued, and the popularity was average. The prices for all months rose by 1.2 cents. However, the buying momentum in the market was weak. Only large February buyers continued to drag in. After the second session, it was heard that the spot yarn market was sluggish and the market price was falling frequently, which affected people's hearts. The prices for all months tended to go downstream again. As a result, the February contract rose by 0.2 cents compared to the previous day's closing price, while the others all fell by 2, 7, and 9 cents. After the afternoon opening, the price for the current month suddenly rose by 1.4 yuan. It was rumored that the buyers were collecting a large amount of goods and were determined not to let go of the December contract, so people's hearts were turbulent. The far-term prices were slow, and the prices on the table became tighter and tighter. However, the current yarn trading was very weak. The rising momentum was even stronger at the closing time. As a result, the prices for all months rose by 1.8, 9 cents to 2 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that the sales were 1,150 bales of Deda, 1,250 bales of Dafu, 1,300 bales of Yuda, 800 bales of Dafeng, 2,650 bales of Mingde, 1,550 bales of Fengtai, 2,000 bales of Renfeng, 2,050 bales of Fukang, 800 bales of Xincheng, 1,250 bales of Yichang, and 800 bales of Shengyuan. The purchases were 5,000 bales of Gengfeng, 1,300 bales of Hengyi, 1,000 bales of Zhenda, 1,850 bales of Taichang, 2,000 bales of Changfeng, 950 bales of Xiecheng, 1,200 bales of Dachangcheng, 750 bales of Yongda, 600 bales of Changyu, 500 bales of Juxing, 500 bales of Yukang, and 500 bales of Jifeng. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn sales are less than 300 bales. The current yarn sales are very sluggish. It was found that the total amount bought by various gangs for the whole day was only 297 bales, and the selling price fell by 2-3 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below: Wuhu 5, Henan 25, Peers 10, Inland 33, Anqing 10, Guangdong 5, Xuzhou 20, Total 297.</p>
<p>Production prices are not relaxed, and cotton hedge sales are gradually lacking.</p>
<p>The cotton market started to fall and then rose, and the market situation turned for the better. However, overseas American and Indian cotton are still in a sluggish state, and factory demand is not smooth. Most of them are bearish. In fact, the standard yarn is rebounding, and the selling price in the area is tightened and not relaxed, so hedge sellers feel a lack.</p>
<p>Standard cotton rebounded by 0.2-0.3 yuan. In the opening market for standard cotton, the selling momentum was strong due to the decline in the overseas Indian and American cotton markets and the sluggish yarn market. The prices for all months fell by 0.05-0.1 yuan. There was still a lack of upward momentum in the second session. By the time of closing, the market conditions were slightly higher as Sampin cotton's telegram showed that the far-term prices continued to rise by 1 yuan. As a result, the prices for all months still fell by 0.05-0.12 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, except for the April contract, which rose by 0.05 yuan. After the afternoon opening, the prices rose along with the yarn market, and the momentum was tight. There were not many sellers in the market. The prices continued to rise after the second session. As a result, the prices for all months rose by 0.15-0.45 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that the sales were 3,500 dans of Yuda, 1,000 dans of Jifeng, 1,000 dans of Mingde, 2,400 dans of Gengfeng, 3,600 dans of Dachangcheng, 1,200 dans of Yichang, 3,600 dans of Tonghe, 3,400 dans of Xinhua, 1,100 dans of Minghua, 1,600 dans of Taichang, 1,900 dans of Changfeng, 1 dan of Jinghua, 2,900 dans of Xincheng, and 1,400 dans of Yikang. The purchases were 6,000 dans of Hengyi, 1,000 dans of Dafeng, 3,000 dans of RunKang, 1,100 dans of Shengyuan, 1,600 dans of Xinchang, 2,800 dans of Taixing, 2,100 dans of Yuanyi, and 2,800 dans of Fukang. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>The current cotton sales are still mediocre. The current cotton factory operations are not smooth. The source is 1,260 bales of Yaohua, 1,118 bales of Tonghua, and 6,600 of Lingbaohua. Shenxin Factory imported 332 pieces of spot goods. Hankouhua 50.00. Yongan Factory imported 200 pieces. Also, Wutong Factory imported 105 pieces at 50.21. Also, 217 pieces.</p>
<p>American cotton closing market atmosphere revived</p>
<p>Yesterday's opening of American cotton trading was still active. However, due to poor Liverpool telegrams, continued heavy auto industry labor strikes, and unfavorable Japanese financial conditions, the prices for all months fell by 1-9 points. Then, due to buying by peers, part of it reacted, and finally ended with a bull market revival. The cooperative and Western gang sold, and the market conditions were tired again. Before the closing, the stock market was strong, and President Roosevelt's inaugural speech, coupled with peer buying in the near month, improved the market price again. The closing was firm, with the spot price falling by 6 points and the futures price rising by 1 point to falling by 3 points. British cotton spot fell by 6 points, and futures fell by 2-4 points. Indian cotton was initially tired due to the settlement of old bulls, but then improved due to purchases by European exporters and the lack of hedge sales. The prices recovered. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell by 0.5-1 rupee, Aomula fell by 0.25-1.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (20th telegram).</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast on the 21st was: Bailuoxi was 227.5 rupees, Aomula was 205 rupees, up 1.25 rupees, and Pingguoer was 179.5 rupees, up 1.5 rupees.</p>
<p>Attached American cotton private estimate</p>
<p>New York, 20th. The Chicago Shields Company predicts that the number of ginned bales for this season will be 11,927,000.</p>

The near-month closing was 76.6 yuan, and the far-month closing was 78.7 yuan.</p>
<p>Tianjin Cotton Merchants' Business Has Repeated Setbacks</p>
<p>In the Tianjin cotton market last year (1936), fine lint cotton surpassed coarse lint cotton. The number of Shanghai and Japanese merchants stationed in Tianjin to collect goods increased by five. However, due to the sharp market conditions and the high base price, cotton merchants were often in danger. During the first half of the year, the maximum price of fine lint was 62 yuan, and the maximum price in the second half of the year was only 60 yuan. Coarse lint increased to 48 yuan in the first half of the year and rose to 49 yuan during the late July and early August period when there was a shortage, so cotton merchants made a maximum profit of 5-6 yuan per bale. When new cotton was listed, the opening price of 45.5 yuan gradually fluctuated, and the price only returned to 47.5-48 yuan at the end of the year. Cotton merchants suffered repeated setbacks in the middle and had little hope of making a profit. Most of them maintained a draw. Cotton warehouses earned a fixed income and made a profit of 45,000-120,000 yuan due to the increase in trade this year.</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>Dyed Blank Cloth Sales Particularly High</p>
<p>Discounted Sale of "Luo Ling" Twill Velvet</p>
<p>Yesterday, the listed yarn price rose by two yuan, but the actual yarn price continued its sharp decline. The cloth market was affected and remained sluggish. Japanese and other foreign firms' white goods orders were few. Businesses from Tianjin and some local firms tended to sell, further pressuring the market. Among Eastern-produced white goods, fine twill was the weakest, continuing to drop by (per bolt) five cents. Fine cloth remained firm, rebounding slightly by two and a half cents. Gray cloth and coarse cloth were both firm. Transactions were mainly with dyeing factories and wholesale departments on this street, with dyed cloth and blank cloth accounting for the majority. This is because, according to usual practice, dyeing workshops stop work after the 20th day of the twelfth lunar month. Therefore, they must rush to dye cloth at this time to prepare for the spring market. Therefore, the daily transactions of fine cloth in the market are still considerable. The white goods from this factory are also weakest in fine cloth and fine twill, with sluggish customer sales. The dyeing factories on this street have limited capacity, and prices fell by five cents to ten cents. Coarse cloth and coarse twill, due to shallow inventory, saw a stable market. "Luo Ling" twill velvet continued to be sold at discounted prices yesterday. "Qing Feng" 16-pound double fish "Ji Qing" fell below eleven yuan, matching the opening price at the end of September, a drop of more than four yuan compared to the peak of fifteen yuan in November. Customer orders from Qingdao, Jinan, Luoyang, Xuzhou, for printed goods, floral cloth, satin, and "Zhi Gong" were still good. Sichuanese businesses continued to handle blue cloth, gray cloth, twill, and other items.</p>
<p>"Yuan Fang" Silk Fabrics: More Declines than Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, Thursday, was the day of the 3024th auction by "Yuan Fang" Foreign Firm in this port. Due to the Lunar New Year, the usual practice of postponing was followed, granting a six-week grace period for cash payment. On display were five types of goods: Western Satin, "Yuan" Velvet, "Zhi Gong" Wool Fabric, Silk Fabrics, and Foreign Red Cloth, totaling 46 brands and 66 boxes. The opening bid for Western Satin (5 brands) was lower per yard than the previous period, down by five and twenty-five hundredths of a cent. "Yuan" Velvet (2 brands) fell by four to seven cents. Wool fabrics remained largely unchanged. Silk fabrics (57 brands) also saw a drop in piece prices. "Bo Zi Tu," "Yan Guo Gong," and "Cai Ba Shi" (3 brands) fell by eighty or ninety cents. "Er Mei Luan Feng," "Wu Xing," "Hai Niu," and "Die Xian" fell by about half a yuan. Most of the others fell by twenty or thirty cents. "Hua Zhu," "Zhu Lin," and "Ren Qiu" (3 brands) rose by about ten cents. The called price for light-weight Foreign Red Cloth was weak.</p>
<p>Reduced Sales of Heavy Woolen Fabrics</p>
<p>Yesterday, sales of woolen fabrics gradually decreased due to weather and environmental factors. Except for various local businesses that are constantly restocking heavy winter goods, there were no other transactions. Most of the price increases had subsided. However, direct orders from foreign firms remained brisk, and quoted prices were mostly higher. The prices at the public market were largely firm on the surface but subtly flat. Sellers of heavy woolen fabrics were willing to reduce prices to sell.</p>

<p>After the market opened yesterday morning, flour prices for all months rebounded quickly. As for imported wheat prices, the Chicago wheat market opened very strong, but foreign markets weakened due to profit-taking, resulting in mixed market performance. Closing prices ranged from a decrease of 6.25 to an increase of 3.75, equivalent to a decrease of nearly four cents and an increase of eight cents to two dimes in national currency for near and far months respectively. Canadian wheat fell by eight cents to twelve cents. Although imported wheat saw only a small rise, the sharp decline since the previous week was unexpected. Therefore, the views of bulls and bears gradually approached each other. Bulls have not smoothly reduced their positions, while bears are considering covering, resulting in the opening price rising step by step, up about three cents. By the time the afternoon session opened, the price for the current month stabilized due to slight buying by customers. Due to limited output from factories, shorts gradually covered positions for further months. Therefore, asking prices increased step by step. This situation was partly a rebound from the sharp decline and partly due to renewed confidence among outsiders, so the rebound was three, five, or six cents. If actual sales move forward, the market can temporarily stabilize.</p>
<p>The wheat market opened quietly in the morning but rebounded later. Imported wheat prices remained slightly lower, so trading in various months remained sluggish. However, due to relatively scarce output, prices for February, March, and April were slightly better by two or three cents. There was no opening price for the current month, and no change for June. By the time the afternoon session opened, the sharp rebound in flour prices caused uniform optimism among industry insiders, rebounding by eight cents to twelve cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. However, the future situation still depends on flour sales, which will determine market stability. In the current wheat market, prices fluctuate unpredictably, and factories and merchants have failed to reach an agreement, so there were no formal transactions.</p>
<p>Guangdong Merchants Take Advantage of Low Prices to Purchase Customer "Xian" Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for customer "xian" rice was lively, as Guangdong merchants continued to actively purchase. Although Guangdong Province has temporarily approved a foreign rice tax, current Shanghai market prices are low, making it a good opportunity to actively purchase. Yesterday, more than 10,000 bags of Hankou brown rice and 4,000 to 5,000 bags of machine-milled rice were purchased. Sales of brown rice to Guangdong were the strongest, but stocks did not appear large, so the market was raised by five or six cents. Due to abundant stocks and the year-end closing, millers and merchants were eager to sell machine-milled rice, so trading was active, but machine-milled rice was weak, down by three to five cents. Throughout the day, more than 11,300 bags of Jiangxi rice, 807 bags of Hunan rice, 10,000 bags of Hankou brown rice, 4,150 bags of Wen Yong rice, and 100 bags of Xiaojiao rice were sold, mostly purchased by Guangdong merchants, followed by a small amount for local oil shops, etc., for minimal needs.</p>
<p>Difficult to Develop the "He Xia" Rice Market</p>
<p>("Sa Bei") Yesterday, shipments from more than 30 sources in "He Xia" saw weak sales in the market. The price of high-quality white "geng" rice was flat and weak. Early in the morning, merchants wanted to raise prices for medium-quality rice, but due to weak sales, prices softened again. Early "Bo Dao" rice was firm, and white "Yuan" rice was popular, and prices turned weak, and the price of hidden "Yin Yuan" was still strong. The prices of other goods were stable.</p>
<p>("Hu Nan") Yesterday, shipments from more than 60 sources totaled 12,500 to 12,600 "shi," including shipments of "Bo Dao" from more than 30 sources. The market situation remained weak. Qingdao merchants purchased over 1,000 bags of "Bo Dao." The price of high-quality goods remained flat due to limited supply, while medium-quality goods fell by nearly one cent. After consecutive days of price declines, "Hou Geng" rice saw slight demand from shops, and the market situation stabilized. However, considering the overall situation, it seems difficult for the market to improve as the Lunar New Year approaches. "Du Yang Jian" and hidden "Yin Bian Yuan" rice saw similar performance to "Geng" rice, but "Nan Gang" early rice was slightly lower due to its higher price.</p>
<p>Soybeans and Sesame Support a Stable Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign sesame seeds remained at 15.15 yuan and 15.10 yuan, with 500 tons transacted. Although current sentiment is weak, there is still demand, so the overall situation can be supported. The same is true for soybeans. As bean cake sales continue steadily, only the transaction volume fluctuates slightly, and prices remain stable. Soybean owners are unwilling to sell easily. Only a few businesses preparing to close down are slightly accommodating. Yesterday, oil mills purchased three truckloads of Bengbu soybeans. Local and Guangdong merchants transacted 400-500 bags of Northeast soybeans and 400 bags of "Du Dou Sha Huang." Merchants from Fuzhou, Tongzhou, the mainland, and local merchants purchased a total of more than 2,000 bags of Hankou "Chi Zha" soybeans.</p>

<p>New York Futures Silk Rebounds, But White Filature Merchants' Acceptable Prices Still Not Met</p>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk prices rebounded. New York futures rose by two points for the near term and three points for the far term. Yokohama spot prices rose by 20 yuan, and far-term prices rose by 20 yuan. Therefore, American merchants telegraphed, offering 825 yuan for White Filature B-grade 7/8 evenness RR, an increase of ten yuan from the previous day. However, this price is still about ten yuan lower than the price held by Chinese merchants, resulting in few transactions. Yesterday, only "Da Chang Lian" purchased dozens of bales of high-grade White Filature. Only Indian merchants made sporadic purchases. Yesterday, a total of 70 bales were transacted.</p>
<p>British Tea Slow Sales, Price Decreases</p>
<p>England is a major distribution center for black tea, and its performance has a significant impact. According to recent news, sales of tea in London remain sluggish. British and Indian tea merchants, who rely on large re-export business after the New Year, have seen a sharp decline in sales due to the unfavorable European environment and the economic exhaustion of various countries. Even China's Qimen black tea, due to the market downturn, is not selling well at prices above 150 yuan, and prices are gradually falling. The most sluggish sales are for flower-scented tea and broken leaves. Merchants are reducing prices to sell, resulting in the greatest losses. According to observations by tea merchants, the future pricing of Qimen tea will inevitably be lower than in previous years.</p>

<p>Short Covering, Government Bonds Near-Firm, Far-Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for government bonds at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was dull, as both long and short parties persisted in their positions. The environment has not yet cleared, and investors are waiting to see how the situation develops. Transactions were mainly swaps. However, the surface trend was extremely firm, and market prices continued to rise. There are only three days of trading left for the current month's futures, and there will be a struggle ahead. The market opened extremely flat in the morning. Retail buying was still strong. E Ding bonds rose by 0.10 yuan. Second gears bonds dropped slightly by 0.05 yuan due to swaps.

<h3>五金</h3>
<p>Factory Produced Round Nails, "Bei Si," Rise Another Yuan</p>
<p>Factory produced round nails rose another yuan yesterday. The price of each barrel of "Bei Si" was 12 yuan. However, factory production was extremely low due to a shortage of raw materials. The price of round nail raw materials was set at 5 pounds per ton. It has recently soared to around 10 pounds, but there has not yet been a shipment to Shanghai. In terms of sales, there have been no new shipments for a long time, and there are many buyers, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand and a strong market. Only 300-400 barrels were produced.</p>

<h3>“The Great Conscience”</h3>
<p>— Li Ni</p>
<p>Since its formation, the amateur dramatic group has been committed to staging classical plays. However, an invisible boundary seems to have been set, namely that it must belong to realism. This was the case with the previously performed "A Doll's House" and "The Government Inspector," and it is also the case with the current staging of "The Power of Darkness" (Desire Demon) and "Thunderstorm." I agree with this choice very much, and I privately feel that it is very beneficial to the new movement in the current theater. Therefore, I am always happy to say a few words each time. Here, it is about Tolstoy and some matters concerning "The Power of Darkness."</p>
<p>I remember many years ago, there was a Chinese film called "Resurrection of Conscience," which was adapted from Tolstoy's novel "Resurrection." This time, I saw the description of "The Power of Darkness," which also contained the words of repentance made by the character Nikita in the play because of "the discovery of conscience." Tolstoy was once called "The Great Conscience," and linking "conscience" with Tolstoy has deep roots. However, I am afraid that after linking Tolstoy with conscience, it will cause this great writer to only fall into the shadow of passivity, and will obscure his positive side. In his half-century of activity, Tolstoy raised countless concrete questions about socialism. We must pay more attention to these questions than to his own moral completion, and then we can have a clearer understanding of the full picture of this great artist.</p>
<p>Tolstoy's main activities were after 1861, in the old Russia of the pre-revolutionary period, surviving under the semi-serfdom system—the rural Russia, the Russia of landlords and peasants. "The Power of Darkness" posed absolutely real and powerful questions to old Russia, but the contradictions and confusions that appeared when he tried to solve these problems are precisely what we should think about. Tolstoy and we are on the same front in attacking the private property system and other things; however, Tolstoy is a long way from us when he leads the solution of the problem to the moral completion of the individual.</p>
<p>"The Power of Darkness" was completed in 1886, but under the censorship system at that time, it was not immediately allowed to be staged. Here, talking about the persecution of this great genius by old Russia, preventing us from getting more plays besides his few scripts, I think, is meaningful to us. Below are Tolstoy's own words:</p>
<p>"I am very happy to write more scripts, and I feel that I have a special need to express myself in that area: but I know very well that the censor will not pass my plays. You may not believe it, but since I started my activities in this area, the terrible question of censorship has troubled me so much! I want to write according to what I feel, but at the same time, I know that what I write will not be passed; therefore, I have to give up this work. Giving up, giving up, and year after year has passed."</p>
<h3>A scene from "The Power of Darkness"</h3>
<h3>Ostrovsky and "Thunderstorm"</h3>
<p>— Lü Gang</p>
<p>Regarding the playwright Ostrovsky of the old Russian era, he does not seem to have attracted much attention in China. However, in the 19th century Russia, whether in literature or on stage, his works were the most tempting; therefore, Brucrner said: "If anyone wants to know Russia, he should read some of Ostrovsky's works." In fact, Ostrovsky not only had such a great influence in the 19th century, but also in the 20th century, his works are still loved by the vast majority of people. For example, in the 1933-34 Soviet theater season, his twenty-three works were staged in Moscow by twenty-six theaters in thirty-seven different ways; and among them, seventeen performances were the first attempts.</p>
<h3>The Female Lead Katrin in "Thunderstorm"</h3>
<p>Naturally, there is no reason why Ostrovsky has such a great influence. Kropotkin believes: Ostrovsky "is the best manifestation of the mutual influence between the theater and playwright." And Nozaki Shao Fu said: "Ostrovsky is the most "theatrical" writer."</p>
<p>Next, Nozaki Shao Fu narrated the second reason "why Ostrovsky would attract Soviet audiences, actors, and directors so much": "because the leading trend of Soviet drama is realism."…</p>
<p>Indeed, among the realists of the old Russian era, Ostrovsky's great achievements cannot be ignored. Sheng Shumeng said in his book "Russian Modern Thought and Literature": "...Gogol's realism was later developed to a more mature stage by Goncharov, Ostrovsky, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, etc...." From here, one can think of Ostrovsky's indelible contribution to the road of realism in Russia. Generally speaking, Pushkin was the first person to lay the foundation for national literature in Russian literature, while Ostrovsky was the first and only creator of national drama in the Russian theater world.</p>
<p>Ostrovsky's "Thunderstorm," like Pushkin's "Dubrovsky," has already been filmed in the Soviet Union. Kropotkin believes that this is one of Ostrovsky's best plays: in his book "Ideals and Realities in Russian Literature," he said: ""Thunderstorm" is one of the most outstanding plays in modern Russian stage performance." In fact, the greatness of "Thunderstorm" is not an abstract statement like Kropotkin's: it is only "amazing." The main thing is that he completely and truthfully exposed the ugliness of the Russian petty bourgeoisie, without any mysticism, nor infatuation with romanticism, or abstractness like symbolism. "Thunderstorm" is full of the depression, injustice, and shouts of the old Russian era. The dark environment and gloomy atmosphere forced Katrin to take a dead end: jumping into the Volga River. ... This is a very cruel exposure of reality. Ostrovsky grew up in this era, he had the same depressed breathing, and experienced this situation, this climate. At that time, a critic Dobrolyubov wrote two long essays with the meaningful title "The Kingdom of Darkness" to analyze Ostrovsky's plays. This title just explained the characteristics of his plays: exposing this terrible "darkness." (End)</p>
<h3>A Scene of Tension in "Thunderstorm"</h3>
<h3>Children's Night Talk</h3>
<p>— By M. Koltsov</p>
<p>"Bersa, are you asleep?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm about to fall asleep."</p>
<p>"Bersa, I'm very hot."</p>
<p>"Then, kick off the blanket."</p>
<p>"Bersa, is the North Pole very cold?"</p>
<p>"It depends on where. Around the North Pole, the temperature gradually, gradually decreases until it completely disappears."</p>
<p>"That's fun. Where did it go? Who lives there?"</p>
<p>"Everything can live there. Bears, wolves, and parrots. The weather there is very bad. The weather only starts to change in June."</p>
<p>"Is tomorrow May 1st?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Now go to sleep. Tomorrow we have to run around all day in a truck."</p>
<p>"Bersa, why aren't you a Soviet hero?"</p>
<p>"I don't have time! We have a lot of homework, and there's no time left to learn to fly."</p>
<p>"But why do pilots wear goggles?"</p>
<p>"That's because the air in the sky is very thin. If you don't wear goggles, you can't see anything."</p>
<p>"Why is it called Franz Josef Land?"</p>
<p>"Because they always live there. I hope they are twins."</p>
<p>"Are you a twin?"</p>
<p>"Of course not. I don't even have time to breathe, how could I be a twin? Now the homework is so heavy! They have increased the teachers' salaries, and they are preparing to squeeze our oil. But what we get in return is also worth being thankful for. Arithmetic alone is worth the price. So is natural history. Do you know how far a kangaroo can jump? It can jump thirty-two feet."</p>
<p>"You're lying to me."</p>
<p>"It's true. The teacher said so. And it only uses two hind legs, otherwise it could jump even further."</p>
<p>"Bersa, I want to be a kangaroo too, okay?"</p>
<p>"You can't. It's an animal, but you are a child. It's absolutely impossible."</p>
<p>"Bersa, how do you know so much?"</p>
<p>"Think about it, I'm already in third grade!"</p>
<p>"Bersa, have you seen the Tsar?"</p>
<p>"I saw him once."</p>
<p>"Is he scary?"</p>
<p>"Not very scary. When you first see him, everyone feels scared, and to be honest, I was a bit excited myself. He has a big beard. But then he started running around in circles, the weavers, cooks, and old Grandma Babariga all followed him, bees stung them, people sang songs, beat drums, and he stroked his beard. It was very interesting at that time." (Note 1)</p>
<p>"Grandma said there are a lot of Tsars in Leningrad, but is that true?"</p>
<p>"Humph, if you believe Grandma's nonsense, your ears will fall off. What Tsar can live there? It's different from before the revolution. Now we don't need them except to guard the door in theaters or department stores."</p>
<p>"Were there children before the revolution?"</p>
<p>"Not many... yes. The Young Pioneers didn't have scarves then."</p>
<p>"You're lying to me."</p>
<p>"It's true. Generally speaking, everything that happened before the revolution can make us laugh to death. No demonstrations, no tangerines, no airplanes, the workers had to hide, Uncle Bobonov was imprisoned, Uncle Simite didn't even have a beard. Only Pushkin wrote poetry, but he was killed by a fascist."</p>
<p>"Ah, you're just lying to me."</p>
<p>"It's definitely true. Why would I make up stories? Many people say that."</p>
<p>"How long ago was that?"</p>
<p>"Four hundred years ago. I don't think I was born then. I was born on August 6th, and cannons were fired on my birthday."</p>
<p>"Can the pre-revolutionary era start again?"</p>
<p>"Of course not. Do you think a born tangerine can fall back into the soil? Uncle Bobonov won't go to jail again. Even if the barber shaves Simite's beard, it will grow back as it was."</p>
<p>"Where is Uncle Bobonov?"</p>
<p>"He is our Nankopolis." (Note 2)</p>
<p>"Have you seen him?"</p>
<p>"I haven't. I don't pretend to have seen him."</p>
<p>"Bersa, are you asleep?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Why can't you sleep? It's almost ten o'clock, because half an hour has passed since a quarter past nine."</p>
<p>"Bersa, will they buy you a bicycle?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I'm afraid not. Nothing goes right for me, and I can't do anything good. Arithmetic is difficult. It doesn't matter to me, but if I get a bad grade, Mom will be very annoyed... that's why I haven't been to the theater for two weeks. You children are lucky, you don't have anything to think about, and you don't have to do any work."</p>
<p>"When I grow up, I don't want to work. Five days out of the week, I want to go to the theater. Three days to the Young Pioneer Palace, three days to play in the yard, and the rest of the days are May 1st."</p>
<p>"Why is Grandma so upset with you?"</p>
<p>"Because of the post office. I told her how we play postman: we ran through all the floors, and everyone was given letters. She smiled and kissed me and asked, 'Where did you children get so many letters?' I replied, 'From your desk, Grandma! There's a big package tied with a red ribbon.' When she heard that, she cried and cursed. But we only took the letters, not the ribbon."</p>

<p>"Bersa, are fairy tales true stories?"</p>
<p>"It depends on the situation. Some are true, some are made up by the priests. They are false."</p>
<p>"Is the story of the flying carpet true?"</p>

<p>"Then what about Sleeping Beauty?"</p>
<p>"It was imagined by the priests."</p>
<p>"Then what about Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece and Medusa?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I think that's a true story. Just look at our arithmetic teacher. She is a Medusa. I haven't done anything bad to her. When the children dragged a dead mouse into the classroom, I wasn't even there. But she still wants to punish me.

<h3>Income Tax Collection Guide</h3>
<p>Second Category: Salaries and Remuneration</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Shanghai Income Tax Office, in order to make the details of income tax collection clear to all sectors and facilitate payment, yesterday specially re-released a draft of the "Income Tax Collection Guide for the Second Category: Salaries and Remuneration." The Shen Shi News Agency reporter has recorded it as follows: ㊀ The scope of public officials is as follows: 1. Personnel of party departments at all levels and their affiliated agencies; 2. Personnel of central and local governments and their affiliated agencies; 3. Staff and teachers of national, provincial, municipal, and county schools; 4. Personnel of state-run enterprises; 5. Personnel of local Japanese governance groups; 6. Other personnel engaged in public service in accordance with laws and regulations. ㊁ Laborers and workers of the aforementioned agencies and organizations are not public officials and should belong to the scope of other industries. ㊂ Personnel engaged in public service, regardless of nationality or position, shall have their income from salaries and remuneration withheld income tax in accordance with Article 27, Paragraph 3 of the Implementing Rules. ㊃ Expenses incurred by public officials for official purposes are not within the scope of salaries and remuneration and are not subject to taxation. ㊄ The salaries and remuneration of public officials shall be calculated and taxed based on the original amount paid, without deducting any expenses. ㊅ Self-employed individuals and others engaged in various industries, in addition to the salaries and remuneration earned through labor in their main business, if they also operate a profit-making business related to their main business, their income from salaries and remuneration and profit-making income shall be calculated and taxed separately. ㊆ If the income from salaries and remuneration for business purposes is in the form of goods or securities, it shall be calculated in legal currency based on the market price at the time of giving. ㊇ As stipulated in Article 17 of the Implementing Rules, the deductible expenses are limited to those with business premises. ㊈ The following items belong to the expenses stipulated in Paragraph 4 of the same article: 1. Repair fees for business equipment; 2. Advertising fees; 3. Association membership fees; 4. Stationery, postage, telecommunications, and other miscellaneous expenses. ㊉ Labor insurance expenses for workers may be deducted from salaries and remuneration. ㊉㊀ Self-employed individuals and others engaged in various industries who have joint business premises shall calculate their income and expenses separately based on their agreed share. ㊉㊁ For income from salaries and remuneration calculated on a monthly basis, if the income is less than one month, the actual amount of income shall be used to calculate and tax based on the original amount paid. (For example, if Mr. A's fixed monthly salary is 400 yuan and he leaves his job after half a month, with an actual payment of 200 yuan, the tax shall be calculated at the original tax rate for 400 yuan, with a tax of 4.8 yuan.) ㊉㊂ If a public agency or employer fails to pay the full salary on a monthly basis, the tax shall be calculated in accordance with the following regulations: 1. For those who pay salaries at a discount, the tax shall first be calculated based on the actual amount paid. When the unpaid portion is paid, it shall be combined with the paid portion to calculate and pay the tax difference. For example, if Mr. A's monthly salary is 300 yuan and he is first paid 60%, which is 180 yuan, a tax of 2.2 yuan shall be temporarily calculated based on the tax rate of the first paid portion. When the remaining 40%, which is 120 yuan, is paid, it shall be combined with the paid portion, i.e., a tax of 5.6 yuan shall be levied monthly based on the tax rate of 300 yuan. In addition to the 2.2 yuan already paid, 3.4 yuan shall be paid monthly. 2. For those who use advances instead of paying salaries, the tax difference shall be calculated and paid in accordance with the calculation method of the previous clause based on the actual amount borrowed in each month. ㊉㊃ For income from salaries and remuneration calculated on an annual basis, the total amount of income for one year shall be divided by the number of months in one year, and the resulting number shall be the monthly average. For example, if Mr. A's annual salary is 1,200 yuan, it shall be divided by twelve, and the monthly average is 100 yuan, with a tax of 0.6 yuan. A total of 7.2 yuan shall be taxed for twelve months, and it shall be withheld and paid together at the time of payment. ㊉㊄ Income with a fixed term, such as salaries and remuneration calculated on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, or fixed-term allowances, shall be calculated in the same way as the previous paragraph, with the number of months in the period and the amount of income averaged. ㊉㊅ If there is income from salaries and remuneration calculated on a monthly basis and calculated on an annual basis at the same time, or if there is income with a fixed term, when there are two or more types, they shall be calculated and averaged together. For example, if Mr. A's monthly salary is 300 yuan and he pays income tax of 5.6 yuan monthly, and he receives an annual bonus of 1,200 yuan at the end of the year, the amount of the annual bonus shall be divided by the number of months in one year, and the resulting monthly average is 100 yuan. Adding this to the monthly salary of 300 yuan, Mr. A's monthly average income is 400 yuan, and the monthly tax should be 9.6 yuan. In addition to the 5.6 yuan already withheld monthly, an additional tax of 4 yuan is required monthly, with a total of 48 yuan in additional tax for the entire year, which shall be paid together when the annual bonus is paid. If the monthly salary increases or decreases during that year, it shall be calculated in accordance with the above-mentioned method when paying the additional tax. ㊉㊆ The amount of income tax payable for income from salaries and remuneration shall be calculated in accordance with the attached table. ㊉㊇ When paying salaries and remuneration each month, heads of agencies or employers shall deduct the income tax payable by their directly affiliated public officials or their employees separately and send it directly to the local Central Bank or other tax collection agencies entrusted by it, obtain a receipt, and fill out the Category II, Type A or Type C Income Statement, along with the withholding list, and report it to the local competent collection agency. If there are circumstances mentioned in Items 13 to 16 of this Guide, the withholding agency shall indicate them separately when reporting. ㊉㊈ Self-employed individuals and others engaged in various industries, if there is no fixed paying agency or employer, shall settle their accounts once every six months starting from January 1, 1937, fill out the Category II, Type B Income Statement based on the average monthly income, and if expenses need to be deducted, they shall also submit an income and expenditure statement on the settlement date to the local competent collection agency to verify the income amount and the tax payable, and pay the tax payable to the local Central Bank or its entrusted tax collection agencies within twenty days from the date of reporting, and obtain a receipt. ㊁㊉ If self-employed individuals and others engaged in various industries fail to provide supporting documents and records during investigations or reviews by the competent collection agency, the competent collection agency may directly determine their income amount based on their business situation.</p>

<h3>Chen Guangfu and Guo Bingwen Gave a Banquet for Patrick Last Night</h3>
<p>Over Eighty People Attended, Including Brennan and Chen Xing. Mr. Patrick Expressed Surprise at the Development of Our Industries</p>
<p>Mr. Patrick, the representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department in China, upon returning to Shanghai from Beijing, was given a banquet last night at the International Hotel by Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the Shanghai Bank, and Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, in view of his significant relationship with the future of our country's construction. The banquet was a grand occasion.</p>
<p>The guests were seated. Those invited to accompany included British Consul General in Shanghai Brennan, Commercial Counselor Peter, Financial Counselor Hopper, Chamber of Commerce President Marshall, Swire Group General Manager Mickle, Brunner Mond General Manager Canleli, Financial Advisor to our Ministry of Finance Rogers, and banking figures Chen Xing, Xi Demao, Ye Zhuotang, Song Hanzhang, Bei Songsun, Xu Xinliu, Wu YunChu, Li Fusun, Zhou Zuomin, Huang Jiangquan, Qin Runqing, Liu Hongsheng, Cai Shengbai, Sun Zhongli, Guo Le, Guo Shun, Tang Shoumin, Yu Qiaqing, Lu Bohong, Yang Jiemei, Zhu Rutang, Xia Xiaofang, and others, totaling over eighty people.</p>
<p>Mr. Guo's Speech. During the banquet, Guo Bingwen delivered a welcome speech, stating that Mr. Patrick, the representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department in China, had recently arrived in Shanghai. Today, Mr. Chen Guangfu and I have prepared a simple feast to welcome him. Everyone present is a leading figure in the banking and industrial sectors and is well aware of Mr. Patrick's past history and experience, so I won't waste words. The purpose of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department appointing Mr. Patrick to this position is probably to allow the representative of the department to make suggestions to the department after on-site inspections. In other words, to examine the creditworthiness of buyers of British goods and recommend them to the headquarters. The British Export Credits Guarantee Department's appointment of this capable representative to take on this huge task is sufficient to show that the United Kingdom has a very strong trust in the future of China. At present, the unity and stability of China's politics, the rapid progress of construction, and the gradual development of industry and commerce have been recognized by the world. Therefore, the British government is assisting its manufacturers and providing long-term credit assistance and encouragement to those who purchase British goods, so that they can participate more in China's construction projects. Therefore, Mr. Patrick's assumption of this position can not only increase Sino-British trade but also promote a deeper understanding of the friendship between the two countries. I am convinced that everyone present wishes Mr. Patrick success and is willing to cooperate as much as possible, etc.</p>
<p>Mr. Patrick's Reply. After Mr. Guo finished his speech, Mr. Patrick stood up to thank him, saying that he was honored to be invited by the two hosts today and to meet with the leaders of Shanghai's financial and industrial sectors. He hoped that he would have a deeper understanding of everyone in the future and increase opportunities for discussion. China's politics have been unified, and the progress of construction will be rapid in the future. In the past, when he was in India, India had cotton yarn shipped to China. Yesterday, he received the China Trade Report from Director Guo, which showed that China's cotton yarn exports were being shipped to India, which shows the amazing development of industry in recent years. Although his duties here are related to material aspects, he deeply believes that it can also be used to enhance the understanding and friendship between the two countries, etc. During the banquet, drinks were exchanged, and the hosts and guests dispersed with joy until around 11:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Swire's New Beijing Wheel Ran Aground Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Bottom of the Ship Has Been Broken, But the Passengers Have Been Safely Rescued.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Swire Shipping Company's New Beijing Wheel, which runs on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, ran aground on the Miri Siis Reef at 5:00 AM yesterday morning, 24 nautical miles from Ningbo (5 miles from Zhenhai). After the ship ran aground, it telegraphed the Shanghai-Ningbo general and branch companies to find a way to rescue it. Upon receiving the telegram, the Shanghai General Company immediately dispatched a special ship to the scene of the accident for rescue. The ship departed from Shanghai for Ningbo at 5:00 PM on the 20th, carrying more than 500 passengers and a large amount of cargo. It is reported that Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and took the ship to Ningbo. After the ship ran aground, Mr. Shen immediately telegraphed his family in Shanghai. His wife, upon learning of this, took the early express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou and then to Ningbo at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. However, according to Swire Shipping Company's ticket office, Mr. Shen had come to book a cabin yesterday morning, but he canceled his ticket before departure and took the New NingShao to Ningbo instead. As for the passengers on the ship, they were safely rescued yesterday afternoon, but the ship has not yet been towed out. It is reported that the bottom of the ship has been broken and needs to be repaired in a shipyard.</p>
<h3>44 Foreigners From Shaanxi and Gansu Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tan's Bandit Army Actively Deploys Military Affairs, But the National Army's Decisive Suppression Will Be Difficult to Sustain</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that after the tense situation in Shaanxi and Gansu, foreign nationals residing in the two provinces felt extremely uneasy. Through the best efforts of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a group of 75 foreigners left Xi'an on the 19th to go south. Among them, 44 arrived in Shanghai by train at 7:00 yesterday morning, while the remaining 31 disembarked in Luoyang, Jinan, Nanjing, and other places. Among the 44 foreigners who arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning were citizens of Britain, the United States, and France. According to their statements upon arrival in Shanghai, Yang Hucheng is still surrounded by the Communist bandits and seems to have no way to break out of the situation. Near Xi'an, the actions of the bandit army are very intense. In an area about 150 miles east of Xi'an, large-scale military projects have been built, such as trenches eight feet deep, air raid shelters, and electric fences. About eight or nine miles northwest of Xi'an, there are now about 15,000 bandit troops. Some of the Communist bandit leaders, such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, are in Xi'an city. These people are now starting to prepare to form a Red Army air force. It is also stated that although the Communist bandits are actively equipping and deploying, they firmly believe that if the Central Army implements a suppression, it will not be able to last long and can be quickly eliminated. Due to traffic obstruction in the Xi'an area, external news is unclear. No external letters or newspapers have been received since December 12 of last year.</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," 44 foreign missionaries who left Xi'an on Monday arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 21st) on the Beijing-Shanghai express train. It is said that Xi'an is now garrisoned by Yang Hucheng's troops, while Zhang Xueliang's troops are stationed outside the city. Military movements are very busy around Xi'an. Yang is actually driven by the Communist bandit leaders. Yang's troops have not yet entered the city, but the paper money they use has appeared in the market. As for anti-Japanese sentiments, it is just a disguise. Commercial activity in Xi'an has completely stopped, and prices have skyrocketed, but the current situation is still peaceful. According to the missionaries, Zhang Xueliang cannot escape blame for this rebellion. A total of 77 foreign missionaries left Xi'an, traveling in three long-distance buses and three freight trucks. On the way to Tongguan, they passed through three trench lines, all of which were covered with thick planks to allow passage. There are currently three foreigners remaining in the rebel army: an American female author, Smedley; a British journalist, Bertram; and a German woman of Chinese descent. The three broadcast propaganda on the Xi'an radio station every night. The missionaries who arrived in Shanghai plan to stay in Shanghai to wait for the unrest to subside before returning to Xi'an. Several Catholic priests are staying in Luoyang, and several others are staying in Zhengzhou. The rest are going north to Jinan and Beiping. Among those who arrived in Shanghai this morning are 25 missionaries from Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, 7 British missionaries, 3 children, 8 Russian missionaries, and the Swedish explorer, Sirén. There are still 5 British missionaries and 2 Russians associated with the agricultural experiment station residing in Xi'an, but they will also leave the country within days. Two American missionaries in Pingliang have telegraphed the American authorities in Hankou, saying they will go to Hanzhong and do not want to leave Shaanxi.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministries of Finance and Industry to Oppose Tax Exemption for Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Measures to Facilitate Transportation Should Be Planned</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent telegrams to the Ministries of Finance and Industry in Nanjing, stating: "To Their Excellencies of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing: According to a letter from the Grain Trade Association dated the 20th of this month, since the unification of import taxes on foreign rice, rice from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui has been shipped to Guangdong in large quantities. Our merchants have also purchased and transported rice from the above provinces in large quantities to regulate the market. This helps to offset the outflow of funds and benefit both the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, now Guangdong Province has petitioned the central government to exempt foreign rice from import tax. If this is implemented, not only will a huge amount of scarce capital flow out, but the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will further decline, and the impact on the prosperity of various industries will be profound. Currently, top-grade Jiangxi machine-milled rice in the Shanghai market weighs 180 catties per bag. Shipping it from Shanghai to Guangdong costs an additional yuan, so each yuan can buy 15 catties. Compared to Shanghai Changxi white rice, which currently sells for 14 catties per yuan, the Shanghai-Guangdong comparison seems quite balanced. Moreover, compared to wheat, which only buys 14 or 15 catties per yuan, and soybeans, which buy 15 or 16 catties per yuan, the price of rice is clearly not as high as beans and wheat. Furthermore, the crux of the rice shortage in Guangdong Province lies in the large disparity in exchange rates between Shanghai and Guangdong. 1,500 Guangdong yuan is only worth 1,000 Shanghai yuan. If the Guangdong currency can be raised to the same level as the Shanghai currency, Guangdong rice will naturally become cheaper. According to detailed reports from merchants in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, rice waiting to be transported is abundant in warehouses and even stored in rural areas. If water and land transportation are smooth, supply and demand can naturally correspond, and there will be no shortage. Therefore, the request from Guangdong Province to exempt foreign rice from tax is a short-sighted view. This Chamber of Commerce, engaged in this industry, has more accurate observations and dares not remain silent. We earnestly request that you forward this to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, take into account the overall situation, and do not approve it. We would be extremely grateful." The Chamber also stated, "The reason Guangdong Province is requesting an exemption from foreign rice import tax is simply because of a rice shortage. However, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces have always exported surplus rice to other provinces, and last year was a bumper year. Using the surplus grain from these four provinces to supply the food for the people of Guangdong Province, according to reason, there should be no shortage. Rice from Hunan and Hubei can enter Guangdong via the Yuehan Railway, and rice from Jiangxi and Anhui can enter Shantou via the Yangtze River and then by sea. Compared to Siamese and Vietnamese rice imported from abroad, the speed should not be significantly different. When rice arrives in abundance, prices will naturally stabilize. Currently, the only concern is that the inspection of Hunan rice is too strict and there are not enough vehicles for road transport, which may lead to less rice arriving and high prices. However, this is a temporary issue. If officials and merchants in Guangdong Province can cooperate with officials and merchants in the four provinces to properly plan measures to facilitate transportation, there is no way to remedy the situation. As for hastily requesting tax exemption for foreign rice, it will increase leakage and damage public funds, which is not a win-win solution for the country and the people. We hereby submit this to your ministry for review and request your leadership, which would be in the public interest. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits."</p>
<h3>Three Rice Industry Groups Jointly Announce to Fellow Traders to Strive to Solicit Donations for Aircraft Purchase</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Grain Trade Association, the Hubbei Rice Carriers Joint Benefit Association, and the Changshu Guild jointly announce: "Regarding the announcement, we have received Instruction No. 2702 from the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, stating: 'For compliance. With reference to the letter from the Committee for Soliciting Donations for Aircraft to Present to the Government as a Commemoration of Chairman Chiang's Fiftieth Birthday, the circumstances under which the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry has collected goods donations for the donation of aircraft to celebrate the birthday have been communicated in writing. All bean and rice industries and Beishi branches have ceased collection. A joint meeting was held on the 8th of this month at the Bean and Rice Industry Beishi Office, attended by Gu Xin-yi of the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, Jiang Shi-zhi of the Hubbei Rice Carriers Joint Benefit Association, Lu Mu-qin of the Changshu Guild, Zhang Song-tao and Cha Bao-san of the Rice Grain Trade Association, and Fu Qian-geng and Wu Ji-yun of the Bean and Rice Industry North Office, as well as Zhang Yu-liang, a staff member of our association, who attended the discussion and resolved: ㊀ That the rice merchants are responsible for deducting a total of 11,000 yuan in national currency, and the trading companies are responsible for deducting 5,000 yuan ('including those previously deducted'); ㊁ That, based on the opinions of all parties, and with the voluntary request of the Miscellaneous Grain Industry itself, the 'Miscellaneous Grain Company' aircraft be renamed 'People's Food' aircraft; ㊂ That the Soliciting Donations for Aircraft and Birthday Celebration Committee be requested to reward them with reference to the Miscellaneous Grain Industry example; ㊃ That the above resolutions be forwarded by the Soliciting Donations for Aircraft and Birthday Celebration Committee to the Municipal Party Department for transmission to all groups in Beishi for compliance and implementation, etc., are recorded on file. In addition to separate handling, a corresponding letter is hereby sent to the above for reference and notification, and to strive to carry out the solicitation, complete the mission as soon as possible, etc.' Approved. In addition to separate orders, the association is hereby ordered to comply with the resolutions and strive to promote them. This is of utmost importance. This order, etc., is hereby recorded and announced, hoping that you will refer to it and advise the rice merchants to resume donating the full amount immediately to complete the entire project. This is what we hope for. This announcement is made on January 21, 26th year."</p>

<h3>The American Association's Grand Gathering Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Listening to President Roosevelt's Inaugural Address, Cheering Resonated From Both Locations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that last night (the 20th), about 500 American residents and guests in the city gathered in a room at the American Association to listen to the inaugural address of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt from thousands of miles away. At 1:30 AM, a wireless report announced that President Roosevelt, accompanied by his son, had ascended the platform to take the solemn oath of office. Then, President Roosevelt's loud voice was heard, saying, "I, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, so help me God." This oath was first read by Chief Justice Hughes, and then repeated by President Roosevelt. At that time, the listeners in the Association all cheered, echoing the cheers in Washington. President Roosevelt then delivered his inaugural address. Last night, the American residents in the city were overjoyed, first holding banquets in various places, and after 11:30 PM, they flocked to the Association. A late-night snack was prepared in the Association, hosted by the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, the Chamber of Commerce, and the presidents of various associations such as the American Association. At around 1:15 AM, the wireless broadcast began to report that the leader of the diplomatic corps, the British Ambassador, had entered the hall with the diplomatic corps, and Chinese Ambassador Dr. Shi Zhaoji was also among them. It was also reported that tens of thousands of people had gathered in the square outside the Capitol. The place where President Roosevelt delivered his speech was built in the style of the home of the seventh U.S. President, Jackson. President Roosevelt sat at President Lincoln's old desk. Since President Lincoln, every president has sat there during the last few hours of Congress's adjournment, which has become a tradition. At this time, it was 12:15 PM (Washington time). A transition between the old and the new, during these fifteen minutes, the United States can be said to have no president. Then, the U.S. Marine Corps band played celebratory music, mixed with the cheers of the crowd. Thus, the president's speech could not be heard clearly. Then, the White House Bishop recited a prayer. President Roosevelt's and Vice President Garner's oath-taking took place at 1:30 AM Shanghai time, and President Roosevelt's speech ended at 1:50 AM.</p>

Joint Meeting of Representatives of Various Groups in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Listing Zhang's Crimes: Zhang Xueliang's eleven major crimes of harming the country and the people: 1. Kidnapping the Commander-in-Chief and rebelling against his superior: Zhang Xueliang held the position of Deputy Commander of Bandit Suppression and Acting Commander-in-Chief. Therefore, Chairman Chiang was his direct superior, but he dared to kidnap him in Xi'an for nearly two weeks, arbitrarily coercing him and subjecting him to various harsh treatments and surveillance. Even when members of the Central Committee, such as Shao Lizi, came to visit, they were monitored. His battalion commander, under Zhang's instructions, even carried weapons and demanded to move him, although he was reprimanded and left. However, his lawlessness and unreasonableness can be seen from this. Zhang's crime of rebelling against his superior is obvious. This is his first crime. 2. Lightly initiating civil war and harming the country and the people: Since the founding of the Republic of China, all civil wars, such as the Fengzhi, Zhiwan, Luqi, and wars against the National Army, have exhausted the country's strength. Which of these was not initiated directly or indirectly by Zhang Xueliang? In these several wars, people were displaced and suffered losses of no less than millions. If the people of the country have not forgotten, the tragic situation should be unbearable to recall. Zhang's crime of harming the country and the people is his second crime. 3. Losing four provinces and humiliating the country: During the September 18th Incident, Zhang Xueliang was the highest official in the Northeast. When the incident was urgent, he was still lingering in Beiping, reveling all day long, dancing like a butterfly, and indulging in wine and pleasure. The newspapers reported it, and both Chinese and foreigners ridiculed him. He did not think about defending the territory and repaying the country, fulfilling his duties, but instead lost four provinces and humiliated the country with non-resistance. This is his third crime. 4. Delaying the defense of the Great Wall and missing opportunities: During the defense of the Great Wall, Zhang Xueliang sat idly by and perfunctorily responded without fighting hard. He was also reluctant to leave Tianjin and Beiping, acting as a military obstacle everywhere, missing opportunities. The whole country was indignant and everyone wanted to kill him. Our Chairman Chiang graciously tolerated him and allowed him to go abroad safely. Now, he has returned to the country and is engaged in this illegal activity again. It is heartbreaking to talk about. This is his fourth crime. 5. Seizing territory and taking advantage of opportunities: During the war in the 19th year of the Republic of China, Zhang Xueliang stirred up trouble on both sides. He also monitored the representatives sent by the central government to Shenyang and ordered them to lead their troops to Tianjin and Beiping. At first, he hesitated and observed the situation. When the victory or defeat was decided, he reorganized his troops and entered the pass, seizing the territory of Tianjin and Hebei, taking advantage of opportunities. He also claimed to support the central government and Chairman Chiang, shameless to this extent. This is his fifth crime. 6. Deducting military pay and misappropriating funds: Zhang Xueliang, in possession of troops, neither fulfilled his duty to defend the territory nor made efforts to suppress bandits. He only knew how to deduct military pay and enrich his own pockets. He also harbored sinister intentions and misappropriated funds for Northeast University, etc., recruiting undesirable elements and creating forces to oppose the central government, causing officers and soldiers to lack pay. He also falsely accused the central government of unfair treatment and deceived his subordinates. This is his sixth crime. 7. Surrendering to the Red bandits and boasting shamelessly: Zhang Xueliang did not move forward according to the established national policy of the central government, but dared to make his own claims and boast shamelessly, as if saving the country and the people could only be done this way. He did not know that the Red bandits had their own Soviet government and Red Army organization. How could two governments and armies be tolerated in one country? It was not only tolerating the Communists, but actually surrendering to the bandits. He was mad and acted arbitrarily, only seeking his own interests, disregarding the party and the country. This is his seventh crime. 8. Obstructing bandit suppression and shaking the foundation of the country: Zhang Xueliang knew that the bandit suppression work could be completed in the last two weeks and the country could achieve unification, and all forces could be used to deal with foreign aggression. However, at this time, he suddenly launched an unprecedented coup, causing eight years of hard work to fall short and all the lives of soldiers and civilians and social forces sacrificed in the past to be wasted, and the foundation of the country was greatly affected. This is his eighth crime. 9. Destroying national defense and deepening the enemy's woes: In recent years, the country has been doing everything in its power to build up the Northwest and develop transportation and economy to make it a national defense base. However, Zhang's rebellion in Xi'an completely destroyed it. If it is to be restored to its former state, it will take more time and effort to succeed. The Suiyuan front line is engaged in fierce combat, and the soldiers are wholeheartedly defending the country against foreign aggression. However, the Xi'an Incident has greatly affected them. Zhang boasts about resisting the enemy, but he actually destroys the foundation of national defense to help deepen the enemy's woes. This is his ninth crime. 10. Detaining vehicles and using them to aid the enemy: Before the September 18th Incident, Zhang Xueliang handed over the best vehicles from the Beining, Pinghan, and Jinpu lines, totaling about 2,000, pulled them out of the pass and did not return them. After the September 18th Incident, due to the loss of land due to non-resistance, the vehicles were completely used to aid the enemy. What is the extent of this loss in national transportation resources? This is his tenth crime. 11. Plundering the people's wealth to fill his own pockets: Zhang Xueliang now has deposits in banks at home and abroad totaling tens of millions of yuan. Which of these are not the people's hard-earned wealth from the people of the Northeast? Plundering the people's wealth to fill his own pockets. This is his eleventh crime. The above eleven crimes are the most obvious and major crimes of Zhang Xueliang in harming the country and the people. As for Zhang Xueliang's personal life, his extravagance and licentiousness are known throughout the world. Roads are advertised, and both Chinese and foreigners are shocked. In short, his crimes are too numerous to count. As for his private deposits, which originally belonged to the people's fat and blood, the country's blood, we should demand a public investigation and return them to the state. If the traitor is not eliminated, the disaster will not end. All our compatriots should promptly settle accounts, file lawsuits in court, and be sure to bring him to justice before stopping. This is hereby announced above for your public knowledge.</p>
<h3>Yesterday the Situation Became Increasingly Serious, Almost All Pharmacies Had Their Electricity Cut Off</h3>
<p>Police Were Dispatched to Seal Off Store Doors and Arrest Store Employees; The Entire City's Industry Was Highly Indignant Upon Hearing the News</p>
<p>The Strike Wave of Pharmacies in the French Concession</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The pharmacy strike wave in the French Concession intensified yesterday as the French Municipal Council completely cut off electricity to all pharmacies, dispatched police to seal off pharmacies such as Xiuxin Tang, and arrested Feng Meiying, wife of the owner of Gaodesheng Tang, and store employee Ma Yan Kang, etc. The situation became even more serious, and the entire city's industry was highly indignant. The executive and supervisory committee members of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association went to the municipal government yesterday afternoon to petition, urging them to quickly negotiate to avoid expansion. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter to the French Municipal Council, asking them to consider the difficulties of businesses and not to force harsh levies, but the Municipal Council refused to accept it. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Situation Became Increasingly Serious Yesterday: The strike wave of pharmacies in the French Concession has entered a more serious stage. According to reporter investigations, the French Municipal Council dispatched personnel again yesterday morning to warn each pharmacy that if they continued to resist paying the levy, all electricity would be cut off. Each pharmacy ignored this and adhered to the association's resolution. Yesterday morning, Xiuxin Tang on Kangti Road, Lirunde, and Mitianyi Tang on Jin Shenfu Road were the first to have their electricity cut off, and the store entrances were sealed off with barbed wire and other obstacles. Police were dispatched to guard the front and rear doors. After 2 PM, the Municipal Council dispatched police cars to cut off electricity to the striking pharmacies. By about 5 PM, according to reports received by the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, almost all had their electricity cut off. Moreover, Feng Meiying, wife of Gao Yu Feng, manager of Gaodetang Pharmacy on Malang Road, and store employee Ma Yan Kang, etc., were also arrested and handcuffed. Observing the situation, it will be difficult to resolve for a while. The entire city's industry was extremely saddened and indignant upon receiving the news. The Pharmaceutical Industry Association has scheduled a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for 2 PM this afternoon to discuss the first step in response.</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Industry Association Requests Prompt Negotiations: Cen Zhiliang, etc., executive and supervisory committee members of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, prepared a petition yesterday afternoon at 1 PM and went to the municipal government to petition. Yu Mingqian, a section member of the Second Section, received them. After stating the petition's intention, Yu section member said that the municipal government was very concerned about the pharmacy strike wave. After receiving the report from the Social Affairs Bureau, Secretary Geng Jiaji was dispatched to negotiate with the French Consul General today (yesterday). He has not returned yet. They will notify your association of the result later and advise all colleagues to wait quietly for a resolution. The committee members returned satisfied.</p>
<p>A Six-Point Explanation Regarding the French Side: The Pharmaceutical Industry Association refuted the reasons announced by the French Municipal Council in its notice, stating that: ⑴ The strike by the entire industry in the French Concession was incited by the French Municipal Council cutting off electricity. The French Municipal Council should bear the responsibility for instigating the strike. ⑵ The detailed regulations for the additional levy were not notified in advance, and the levy rate was completely unfounded. ⑶ The pharmaceutical industry already has a categorized business tax. Adding a pharmaceutical sales regulation tax is an unnecessary layering of taxes. The taxes paid by Chinese pharmacists do not need to be equal to those of foreign pharmacists. ⑷ The water and electricity companies are profit-making organizations. Users have an obligation to pay fees and the right to use them, which has no relationship to the Municipal Council's so-called "taxes levied on residents are commensurate with the benefits of the public facilities they receive." ⑸ Although the Municipal Council has expressed that it may reduce the levy by half, even half still requires the ability to pay and must be an acceptable amount. ⑹ The council's claim that it is instigated by a few people attempting to cause harm is laughable to knowledgeable people.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Letter to the Municipal Council: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the French Municipal Council, stating: "Respectfully, regarding the collection of the Chinese medicinal material and drug sales tax in your concession, we wrote to your council on the 14th of this month requesting that you stop the excessively oppressive collection. We also sent a letter to the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, instructing them to inform us of the details of the aforementioned levy and advising them to make reasonable requests and not to go to extremes. These matters are on file. Now, according to the association's follow-up letter (omitted), please grant assistance, etc. We are enclosing a copy of the Chinese medicinal material and drug sales regulations and a translation of your council's reply. Based on this, we have found that the Chinese pharmacies operating in your concession pay taxes such as police and categorized business taxes. Now, imposing a business tax on top of that is layering taxes, and the industry truly cannot bear the squeeze. Moreover, according to Article 6 of the Chinese medicinal material and drug retail sales regulations, if they are unable to pay the tax, they only need to be prosecuted in the jurisdictional court. Now, abruptly cutting off water and electricity has incited the industry to strike. At this time of severe winter and the end of the year, it not only hinders the commercial security within the concession but also delays treatment for sick residents, which is no small matter. Correspondingly, we continue to inform you of the situation, hoping that your council will investigate and take a fair and lenient view, not just thinking of the levy collectors' side and considering the ability of Chinese pharmacists to bear the burden, and forcefully restrain the forced levy procedure of cutting off water and electricity. We are deeply grateful and hope to receive a reply." Addressed to the French Municipal Council.</p>
<p>The French Municipal Council's Reply to the Chamber of Commerce: The French Municipal Council replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Respectfully replying, we have received your letter regarding the suspension of water and electricity for the collection of the 1936 drug tax from Chinese pharmacies and request that you stop it. We have reviewed it thoroughly. This case was decided by a meeting of the French Consulate General in Shanghai on December 8, 1935, and there is no reason to cancel it. Moreover, in February of last year, because of the pharmaceutical industry's downturn and fearing that the pharmacies would not be able to include the drug tax in their annual budget, we specially approved a reduction of the tax amount from two-thirds of the original amount to one-half. All those who have paid the tax will be calculated and refunded according to one-half. Currently, our council has notified all pharmacies within the concession that they must pay this one-half drug tax, otherwise, in addition to suspending water and electricity, we will still pursue the full year's tax amount. Our council cannot change the established regulations. We hereby reply to your letter for your information." Addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The Second Special District Jointly Requests the Recall of the Order: The Citizen's United Association of the Second Special District wrote to the French Municipal Council, stating: "Respectfully, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Chinese Pharmaceutical Industry Association stating that the French Municipal Council is forcibly collecting drug and medicinal material sales taxes and is adopting barbaric methods, ordering the water and electricity company to dispatch personnel to cut off the water and electricity of Chinese pharmacies such as Daren Tang, Guangsheng Tang on Baxianqiao, and Taishan Tang on Damalu, as a coercion for collecting taxes. Please grant assistance, etc. Upon review, your council should carefully consider the current commercial situation when collecting new taxes. In this autumn of economic depression and the decline of all industries, maintaining the status quo is already difficult for each industry. If heavy taxes are suddenly increased, how can merchants and residents bear them? Now, your council is recklessly collecting these layered taxes, and merchants and residents naturally want to refuse. Unexpectedly, your council is using the means of cutting off electricity to force tax collection because tax collection is unsuccessful. This kind of erroneous action is not appropriate for the municipal authorities. Taxes and water and electricity are clearly two different things. Proper taxes are the obligations that citizens should fulfill. Water and electricity are commercial in nature and are paid directly by citizens to the water and electricity company for use. If there are no outstanding water and electricity fees, water and electricity should not be cut off. Now, your council is using cutting off electricity as coercion for tax collection, which is inappropriate in terms of both human relations and legal principles. Therefore, the citizens of this district are deeply angered by the oppression of Chinese pharmacies. We should request that your council deeply understand the people's sentiments and consider the merchants' difficulties, quickly recall the order, and cancel the new tax. For water and electricity, those that have been cut off should be restored immediately, and we hope that you will not adopt defensive measures in the future to avoid accidents. Correspondingly, we hereby send this letter, hoping that you will investigate and handle it and reply accordingly." Addressed to the French Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Member Jiao Yitang Hosted a Banquet for Various Circles the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>筹建国医院　进行颇顺利</p>
<p>筹建国医院　进行颇顺利</p>
<p>筹建国医院　进行颇顺利</p>
<p>筹建国医院　进行颇顺利</p>
<p>Planning the Construction of a National Hospital; Progress is Quite Smooth</p>
<p>Jiao Yitang, member of the Central Committee and Director of the Central National Medicine Museum, is enthusiastic about promoting the cause of traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacy, working diligently and sparing no effort. Recently, in view of the fact that foreign countries are studying traditional Chinese medicine, and that the Chinese people should preserve and promote this inherent national essence, he intends to plan the establishment of a National Capital Hospital, gather experts, and focus on research. He has already received the support of famous people at home and abroad. Jiao came to Shanghai on the 13th of this month with his secretary Zhang Xijun, spared no effort, and actively carried out this initiative. Upon hearing the news, the Shanghai medical and pharmaceutical groups were excited by Jiao's enthusiasm for promoting traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacy. On the afternoon of the 19th, the Shanghai Municipal National Medicine Association, Shenzhou National Medicine Society, Chinese Medical Association, Chinese Medicine Association, and Shanghai Municipal National Pharmacy Association, Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Association, Traditional Chinese Medicine College, Chinese Medical College, and New China Medical College jointly initiated a welcome meeting at the Ningbo Association, attended by more than 500 people. Details have been published in previous newspapers. Now, in order to thank the medical and pharmaceutical groups for their feelings, Jiao specially hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road the night before last, entertaining more than 200 famous people in Shanghai. During the banquet, Director Jiao delivered a speech, saying that traditional Chinese medicine is developing overseas recently, and the research of Chinese people should not lag behind. In the future, he hopes that comrades in the traditional Chinese medicine community will use scientific methods to organize traditional Chinese medicine so that this inherent national essence of our country for thousands of years will not be lost. The capital is where Chinese and foreign people watch, and the center for promoting academics, so it is necessary to create a national hospital to promote the achievements of ㊅ medicine and popularize the belief of the masses. Being ambitious and far-reaching depends on this. However, the National Hospital is still a pioneering initiative in our country. The scale is complete and it takes a lot of planning. I sincerely hope that famous people at home and abroad, and the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacy community, will support it so that it can be realized as soon as possible, and that Hong Chinese medicine and pharmacy will be more effective. Yitang knows that this matter is huge and cannot be done by one person alone. Now, with Wu Xun's hard work in running schools, I seek sympathy and unity to seek welfare for the masses. I am determined to do this and will not slacken." Then, guests Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Yu Xianglin, Gong Xingzhai, etc. gave speeches successively. Afterwards, Rong Zongjing, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Qu Wenliu, Zhu Ziqiao, Chen Guangfu, Wang Boqi, Zhuang Dezhi, Lin Kanghou, Qian Xinzhi, Chu Huiseng, Fang Jiaobo, Chen Chuxiang, Shen Zhongfang, Zhu Ziyun, Ding Zhongying, Ding Jiwan, Wang Zhongqi, Zhu Hegao, Xia Libin, Gu Weichuan, Zhu Binglu, Tong Baoqing, and Ling Xinjia were publicly elected by the attendees to be responsible for soliciting donations separately. The banquet ended at 11 o'clock. It was also heard that Jiao, as an important official in Beijing, could not stay and took a train to Beijing that night. All unfinished matters will be left to his secretary, Zhang Xijun, to handle in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>The Public Concession's Water Rate Changed from 75% Discount to 80% Discount</h3>
<p>The Company Wanted to Change to 85% Discount; The Board of Directors Rejected It</p>
<p>The water rate set by the Public Concession Waterworks has been paid at a 75% discount since April 1935. At the end of 1935, the Municipal Council agreed with the company that changes to the discount would only be considered after one year. At the end of last year, the company petitioned the Municipal Council to allow them to charge at an 85% discount, the reason being that the expenses were huge and they wanted to ensure that the water supply could continue without danger. These expenses could not be saved. The Municipal Council's Public Works Committee put it forward for discussion at a meeting on the 11th of this month. The director of the council's Finance Office suggested that it could only be changed to an 80% discount. If the company's expenses were still insufficient after changing to an 80% discount, it should be made up from the company's reserve fund. Mr. Pearson, the company's manager and chief engineer, attended and explained the reasons for the price increase, saying that the exchange rate has fallen recently, resulting in increased expenses, and that several machines must be added this year. In addition, the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association instructed the company to install individual water meters in each building. In the future, the amount of water consumed by tenants will inevitably decrease day by day, and the company's losses will be more difficult to make up for. If the water price is changed to an 85% discount this time, it may not be necessary to increase the price in the future. After discussion, four recommendations were passed as follows: ⑴ The committee, because the Shanghai Waterworks Company has made every effort to save expenses within the feasible range, allows the company to charge users at an 80% discount instead of a 75% discount based on the amount of water recorded on each user's water meter according to the company's original price list from February 1, 1937. ⑵ According to the agreement between the Municipal Council and the company, if the situation changes in the future, the amount of the discount may be discussed at any time. ⑶ When the board of directors rejects the company's request to change to an 85% discount, pay attention to the company's expenses, which have increased significantly from 1933 to 1937. ⑷ In the future, the water meter issue will be studied in detail by the departments in charge of the Municipal Council and the company's personnel. The above four recommendations were approved by the Municipal Council's board of directors at a meeting on the 20th of this month, and the Waterworks Company has also agreed.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Verdict in the Bao Gang Case</h3>
<p>Extrapolating Yang Yuehua's Bazi; Her Age Was Already Over Twenty Years Old</p>
<p>The case of lawyer Bao Gang and his servant Zhang Xinkui, who were previously sued by Cui Changgui, the bodyguard of the detective team leader of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, at the Local Court for seducing his fiancée Yang Yuehua, has been ruled by the Criminal Court of the court that Bao Gang and Zhang Xinkui are innocent, and the plaintiff's incidental civil suit is dismissed. The case once caused a sensation in society, so we looked up the full text of the verdict as follows: "Omitted above" Reasons According to Article 1 of the Criminal Law, the act of punishing is limited to the provisions of the law at the time of the act. Furthermore, Article 293 of the Criminal Procedure Law also stipulates that if the act is not punishable, a verdict of innocence shall be rendered. In this case, the defendants, etc., were prosecuted by the prosecutor for the crime of disrupting the family based on Article 140, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the Criminal Law. Although the seduced person, Yang Yuehua, stated that "I am 21 years old this year, I was born in the year of the dragon, on the fifth day of the sixth month of the Republic of China's 5th year. Cui Changgui is my cohabiting fiancé. On May 11, Bao Gang seduced me to the Dafang Hotel, and Zhang Xinkui took me to the countryside, then to Zhang Qinghong's house in Chuansha District for more than a month. I still came to Shanghai once in between." However, the crimes of seduction and abduction in the Criminal Law both require the inducement of men and women under the age of 20 to leave their families as a key element of the crime. Upon reviewing Yang Yuehua's Bazi, which was jointly filed by her father Yang Nanqin and her fiancé Cui Changgui on November 14, it stated that "Bingchen, Xinmao, Jiachen, Guiyou". According to the almanac, it was indeed born on the fifth day of the second month of the Republic of China's 5th year at You hour (5-7PM). Moreover, Yang Buqin stated at the case that "I don't remember whether it was January or June." This kind of Bazi was clearly recognized by Cui Changgui in court during the debate, so Yang Yuehua's age should be based on this Bazi. It should be in February, and the claim of June is difficult to adopt. Her age counted to February 5 of this year (25th year) is already over 20 years old. The alleged inducement on May 11 of this year, the seduced person Yang Yuehua is already over 20 years old, so there is no crime of disrupting the family. In addition, there is no other evidence to prove that the defendants committed a crime. The crime is not established, so a verdict of innocence should be rendered. As for the part of the incidental civil suit, since a verdict of innocence has been rendered, it cannot be relied on and the plaintiff's suit should be dismissed. According to the above, the judgment should be made in accordance with Article 292, Paragraph 1 and Article 507, Paragraph 1, the first paragraph of the Criminal Procedure Law as the main text (omitted below).</p>
<h3>The Overseas Chinese Silk Industry Association in Osaka Remitted Money to Relieve the Suiyuan Disaster</h3>
<p>The United Relief Association of Charity Organizations in Shanghai received a telegram from Feng Yangshan and Yang Zigong, the standing committee members of the association, yesterday, stating: "United Relief Association of Charity Organizations on Yunnan Road, Shanghai. According to reports, the survey personnel in Wuchuan arrived on the 11th and started working on the same day. In order to help the disaster victims urgently, we have also hired five cadres in Peiping to join the various survey teams in order to expedite the process. Wang Lifu and Meng Xianhai joined Taolin, Jia Guangya and Sun Wenxiao joined Xinghe. The members left Ping on the 12th and arrived in Sui on the 14th and were dispatched separately that night. Secretary Zhang Zibin will work in the office for the time being and will be dispatched to the disaster area when necessary. We hereby report this to you for your information. Feng Xuefen, Yang Mingsheng, bowing." The association also received a letter from the General Consulate in Kobe yesterday, stating: "Recently, the Overseas Chinese Silk Industry Association in Osaka has submitted a donation of 100 yen to relieve the victims of the Suiyuan disaster. Please remit it. Correspondingly, we have purchased a Mitsui Bank draft and sent it with the letter. Please check it and send back the receipt for our reference." Addressed to the Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Association. Yesterday, the association continued to receive 1,000 yuan from the Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Trade Association, and 13 large boxes of medicines were donated by the Red Cross Society. Because the association saw that the victims of the Suiyuan disaster were in urgent need of assistance, in addition to sending a follow-up letter urging those who had pledged donations but not yet paid and those who had not yet pledged to pay, it also dispatched accountants to visit members of various organizations and individual members who had pledged donations in order to raise 80,000 yuan as soon as possible to remit to Sui to provide relief to the victims.</p>
<h3>Xian Shi's Female Tea Waitress Sues Zhu Rongkai</h3>
<p>Abandoned After Cohabitation and Giving Birth to a Child; But Medically Difficult to Prove</p>
<p>Zhu Rongkai, a Jiangxi native residing at 38 Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road, was sued civilly by Lu Lanfeng, a 24-year-old Jinhua woman from Zhejiang who used to work as a female tea waitress at Xian Shi Amusement Park, through a lawyer at the First Special District Court. The complaint stated that the virgin came to Shanghai last July to find relatives, and she met Zhu. After they slept together at the Xizang Hotel on Yiqiaxiang Road, they rented a house at 10 Yongyeli, Weihaiwei Road to live together and then chose an auspicious day to get married. Later, she gave birth to a child, named Wenying, but Zhu then hesitated to move forward and abandoned her. She is suing him for abandonment under Article 54, Item 1 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Huang Risheng summoned him once, Zhu Rongkai admitted that he shared a room with the plaintiff at the Xizang Hotel, which was voluntary. He said that Lu Lanfeng (also known as Zhou Suzhen, Bailanhua) was a worthless romantic woman working as a tea waitress at the Amusement Park, and there was no renting a house to live together. The child was not his. The trial was postponed, and both parties were asked to have their blood types tested to see if Wenying was Zhu's bloodline. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang opened Criminal Court No. 8 for trial. Defendant's attorney Lin Yingqing and Zhu came to court. Zhu resolutely denied that Wenying was his. However, the Zhenru Forensic Institute examined Zhu Rongkai's blood type as O, and Lanfeng's blood type as AB. There is a possibility of having a child with blood type B like Wenying, but current science cannot determine for sure that he is the father. Furthermore, according to Zang Boyong, president of Boyong Hospital, who testified that Lu Lanfeng had consulted him for illness before and was not pregnant. Where did the child come from? The court hearing ordered the suspension of the trial and asked the plaintiff to file a lawsuit to confirm paternity.</p>
<h3>An Iron Wheel Flew Off the Roof and Split Open a Small Worker's Skull</h3>
<p>Died on the Spot; The Scene Was Too Horrific to Bear</p>
<p>The Fufeng Flour Mill on Moganshan Road recently hired artisans to repair the exterior of the factory, which had been corroded for many years and was unsightly. Unexpectedly, at about 9 PM last night, while the artisans were working on a bamboo scaffold several feet high, an iron wheel from the mill's wheat grinding machine suddenly flew off the roof and hit a small worker's head. His skull was split open, and blood and brains gushed out, killing him instantly. His body also fell to the ground, the scene was too horrific to bear. The other workers immediately reported to the factory and called an ambulance. Because he had already died, they sent the body to the coroner's office and reported to the Putuo Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate the cause of the machine wheel falling off in detail in order to investigate.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Revised the Traffic Regulations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council has revised some of its traffic regulations. One of the additions requires drivers to reduce their speed when approaching pedestrian crossings and, if necessary, stop their vehicles to allow pedestrians crossing the street to pass without obstruction. Another regulation stating that "vehicles used by the Fire Department or the Police Department have the right to pass through the streets first when heading to the scene of a fire, riot, or other emergency" has been amended. A paragraph has also been added regarding vehicles following behind, stating that "no vehicle shall overtake another vehicle that has stopped or is moving at an intersection in order to compete to go forward." The regulations regarding parking have also been revised. One of them states that "if a driver stops on the roadway for passengers to get on or off, or for any other reason, he must keep the left side of the vehicle as close as possible to the curb on the left side of the street, except when complying with signals given by a police officer." The locations where long-term parking is allowed have been increased and decreased in several places. All the revised articles have been published in the council's English Gazette issued today.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River Water Level Drops Daily, Sichuan River Navigation Interrupted</h3>
<p>Minsheng Company Invites Experts to Chongqing to Discuss Relief Measures; Downstream Fully Loaded Vessels Can Only Reach Wuhu; Six Companies to Increase Shallow Water Fees by 10% Next Month</p>
<p>As the Yangtze River water level drops daily, the Sichuan River becomes increasingly depleted. After the Zhi Guang Shipping Company's Lao Shu Tong vessel ran aground and sank at Qingtan, the Yichang-Chongqing route was blocked. Minsheng Industrial Company divides the Yichang-Chongqing route into three sections. To maintain shipping, it has invited shipping experts to Chongqing to discuss relief measures. Although navigation between Shanghai and Yichang continues as usual, fully loaded vessels can only reach Wuhu. China Merchants, Sanbei, Ningshao, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin, among other six companies, convened a joint meeting. It was decided to increase shallow water fees by 10% starting from the first of next month. The announcement stated: "The Yangtze River water level is rapidly receding. Our company's fully loaded cargo vessels can only sail as far as Wuhu. Vessels sailing downstream must also travel empty to Wuhu. All passengers and cargo rely on extensive lighterage and transshipment, incurring significant losses for our company. It has been decided that starting from February 1, 1937, all cargo destined for ports above Wuhu will be subject to an additional 10% shallow water fee, bringing the total to 50%. This is hereby announced."</p>
<h3>Dismissed Policeman Chen Anong Steals Handgun from the Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Daring to Openly Sell It to Others; Fortunately Arrested by the Police After Investigation</p>
<p>Chen Anong, a 27-year-old from Hangzhou, previously served as a police officer, No. 2225, at the Fourth District First Precinct Mongolian Road Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. Due to poor character, he was dismissed by his superiors in May of last year, and Chen became unemployed and impoverished. At 3:00 AM on the 8th of this month, Chen went to the Mongolian Road Police Station to borrow money from former colleagues. At the time, the station had</p>
<p>Three Handguns and Eleven Bullets. Chen seized the opportunity, stole them, and fled over the wall. By the time the police station discovered the theft, Chen had already escaped. Afterward, Director Cai reprimanded the officer in charge of the station, and the patrol leader, Liu Sun (a Cantonese), was detained. After stealing the three guns, Chen hid at No. 8, Lane 1292, Qiujiang Road. Recently, Lu Maomao planned to purchase one gun from Chen for 40 yuan, and they agreed to meet at</p>
<p>No. 20 Avenue Edward VII Hongxiang Hotel, Room 19, to complete the transaction. Chen invited Yongren Wang Afa and Zhenjiang native Cai Arong, who brought one gun and three bullets. However, the plan was discovered by Chief Detective You A'gen, Detective Feng Xiushan, and Detective Wu Shoushan of the Old Zha Police Station. They rushed to the scene at 1:00 PM the previous afternoon and arrested Chen, Wang, and Cai. One handgun was found on Wang Afa,</p>
<p>Three Bullets. Subsequently, two handguns and eight bullets were found at No. 8, Lane 1292, Qiujiang Road. All three guns were marked with the words "Shanghai Public Security Bureau," confirming that they were the stolen goods from the Mongolian Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division One. Police attorney Ru Baoyi explained the situation and charged Wang Afa and Cai Arong with public endangerment under Article 187 of the Criminal Law. Chen Anong, because the</p>
<p>Gun Theft Location was within the Chinese area, was requested to be transferred to the Municipal Police Bureau for interrogation and handling. Subsequently, Liu Bingyuan, the detective squad leader of the Municipal Police Bureau, surrendered to the court, requesting that the suspect Chen be transferred. Wang and Cai were also requested to be transferred together for questioning, and that the guns and bullets be transferred as well. Judge Qian Hongye verified the confession and delivered a court sentence, sentencing Wang Afa and Cai Arong to one year of imprisonment each. Chen Anong and the two other suspects, along with the guns and bullets, were handed over to the officers of the Municipal Police Bureau for further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Over the Estate of the "Manure King"</h3>
<p>Ma Lushan to Receive One-Fifth of the Estate</p>
<p>After the deaths of "Manure King" Ma Fuqi and Ma A'gui's sister, the entire estate was managed by the eldest son, Ma Hongkui. The second son, Hongsheng, and the third son, Honggen, did not intervene. After Hongkui's death, his wife, Chen, filed a complaint in the Second Special District Court's Criminal Division, accusing her husband's brother, Honggen, and her husband's concubine, Wang A'da, of seizing the entire estate, claiming it was worth four million. After an accountant's investigation, it was found to be only 800,000.</p>
<p>Through mediation, the estate, plus one public account, was divided into four equal shares, and the case was settled. However, Ma Hongkui had a mistress, Qin, who had a son named Lushan, who is now eleven years old. After Hongkui's death, his wife denied that Lushan was her husband's biological son. Therefore, Qin, as the legal guardian, filed a</p>
<p>Suit for Confirmation of Identity with the Second Special District Court's Civil Division on behalf of her son, Lushan, against Ma Hongkui's wife, Ma Chen, son Ma Lushen, daughters Lu Ying, Lu Zhen, etc. After three trials, it was confirmed that Ma Lushan was Ma Hongkui's heir. Ma Qin, along with her son Ma Lushan, filed another suit in the Second Special District Court's Civil Division on August 10 of last year against Ma Chen, Ma Lushen, Lu Ying, Lu Zhen, etc., seeking the partition of the estate. The subject of the lawsuit was the</p>
<p>One-Fifth of the One-Quarter Share That Ma Hongkui Should Have Received from the 800,000 of Ma Fuqi and Ma A'gui's estate. They also applied for litigation assistance, which was approved. After paying 800 yuan for the surety from a woolen shop to cover litigation costs and accountant fees, Judge Ma Yishu repeatedly held hearings and announced the conclusion of the arguments. Yesterday morning, Judge Ma Yishu presided over the</p>
<p>Civil Division Ruling, that Ma Lushan should receive one-fifth of the estate in Ma Hongkui's name. The litigation costs were to be borne by the defendant. It is said that after learning of the loss, the defendant will file an appeal after receiving the judgment. Whether this is certain remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>Detectives, Posing as Rickshaw Pullers, Capture Extortionists</h3>
<p>The Two Criminals Took a Large Envelope, Beaming with Joy; Unexpectedly, Detectives Surprised Them and They Were Arrested</p>
<p>Li Ming, from Wuxing, Zhejiang, lives in the French Concession and recently served as the head of the patrolmen in the Water Patrol, with a monthly salary of 50 yuan. He is addicted to gambling, especially dog racing. Recently, he lost a significant amount and could not make ends meet, so he had a sudden idea. Knowing that Zhou Renci, the principal of Huang Zhou Elementary School at No. 250 Ruijin Road, had some savings, he colluded with Zhang Daming, from Yunnan, residing in Dongxi Huade Road, to</p>
<p>Write a Threatening Letter at home on the 17th of this month. The letter was mailed, demanding 1,000 yuan from Zhou, otherwise they would resort to extreme measures. The next day, they thought that the letter was not effective enough and wrote another letter, enclosing a bullet. They instructed Zhou to seal 1,000 yuan in legal tender in a large envelope around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. He was to bring it to the corner of Dongxi Huade Road and Zhaofeng Road, No. 227, next to a foreign goods store. There was a telephone pole</p>
<p>With a Red Paper Strip attached as a marker. The letter and the money were to be inserted into a gap, and someone would come to retrieve them. If he did not comply, they would give him a "steel hygienic pill" to drink. This letter was not sent by mail; it was personally delivered by Zhou Renci's old servant, Zhang Shi. Zhou received two threatening letters and was very frightened, so he took the letters to the Jiaxing Road Police Station to report them. Detective Jin Yangwu and Cao Jinbiao were dispatched, disguised as clerks at the foreign goods store, to</p>
<p>Observe the Situation at the door. Zhou Renci, carrying a large envelope that looked like 1,000 yuan in legal tender, took a rickshaw, pulled by detective Liu Zhongcheng disguised as a rickshaw puller, to the telephone pole with the red paper marker. He got off the rickshaw, inserted the money into the gap, and pretended to return to school in the same rickshaw. After waiting for a while, Zhang and Li arrived one after another. They looked around and saw no police officers. Zhang stepped forward and took the large envelope from the gap in the pole,</p>
<p>Beaming with Joy. Just as they were about to escape, detectives Jin and Cao rushed forward and arrested Zhang Daming and Li Ming. They were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division Three. Concession attorney Zhang Tianyin detailed the case and presented the two threatening letters for inspection, requesting a strict investigation. Subsequently, both Chinese and foreign detectives and the victim Zhou Renci, and the maid Zhang Shen, explained what had happened. When questioned, the two defendants stammered and claimed that they were temporarily confused and resorted to this bad plan, requesting leniency. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered them to be remanded in custody to await sentencing.</p>
<h3>Junpu Bureau Orders a Giant Dredger from Germany</h3>
<p>Reuters, Shanghai, 21st dispatch. The Junpu Bureau recently signed a contract with the Schihew Company of Ilbin, Germany, to build a giant dredger at a price of 231,700 pounds. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai within two years. It is said that after the ship is built, it will be the largest dredger in the world, weighing about 10,000 tons and equipped with a main engine with 7,000 horsepower. It can dredge about 30,000 tons of mud per day and carry 4,000 tons of mud. According to the plan of Dr. Charter, Lai, the chief engineer of the Junpu Bureau, the ship is prepared to be used to dredge the sandbar at the entrance of the Yangtze River to facilitate the passage of large ships sailing in the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated that 40 million tons of silt will be dredged from the entrance, which can increase the water depth by 9 feet. Thus, ships with a draft of 33 feet can pass through without hindrance at more than half tide. The Junpu Bureau's existing dredger, Jingxi (which arrived in Shanghai from Germany in 1935), was also built by the same company.</p>
<h3>The Robbery at Shenxin No. 9 Factory Was Committed by Insiders</h3>
<p>The Gatekeeper, the Warden, and the Cargo Manager Were All Detained</p>
<p>Zhu Hanbo, the Chinese detective chief of the Gordon Road Police Station, previously arrested seven robbers from Jiangbei: Ma Da, Gu Naifu, Ji Zhenhua, Chen Huisheng, Wang Mengshi, Song Delong (also known as Xiao Sizi), and a 13-year-old girl, Wang Xiaolaohan, etc. Two handguns and ten bullets were seized and sent to the Special Court for investigation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. At around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, Detective Zhu continued to arrest two accomplices, Li Yunzhang from Tianjin, Yang Yaozhong from Chongming, and Zhang Ronghua from Wan, at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory at No. 140 Macau Road. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division Eight. Police attorney Li Zhishan stated the case and requested detention until the 25th, to be tried together with Ma Da and others. Upon investigation, it was found that the defendants Li Yunzhang and others were related to the case of the robbery of 1,800 yuan in wages at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory on December 4 of last year. Because Li was the gatekeeper of the Shenxin Factory, and Yang Yaozhong was the cargo manager of the factory warehouse, and Zhang was a handyman, all of them were suspected of collusion in the robbery. It was requested that they be detained. Judge Fu reviewed the report, briefly questioned Li and the other three, and ordered a change. The case will be retried on the 25th.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Communications Rectifies the Broadcasting Industry in This City, Suspending the Broadcasting Rights of Eight Radio Stations</h3>
<p>Due to Poor Equipment and Failure to Obtain Licenses</p>
<p>The Broadcasting Association Has Appealed to the Ministry of Communications for Relief</p>
<p>In order to rectify the wireless broadcasting industry in this city, the Ministry of Communications recently issued a special order to cancel the broadcasting rights of eight radio stations, including Dunben, by the end of this month, due to poor equipment. After receiving the order, the Private Broadcasting Radio Stations Association of this city held a special meeting and submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications for relief. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Suspension of Broadcasting Rights of Eight Radio Stations</p>
<p>The Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications stated that the wireless radio station business in this city is very developed, but there are many aspects that need to be corrected and rectified. After review, it was specially instructed that the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of this city forward the order to the Broadcasting Industry Association, ordering the Dunben, Huaguang, Huiling, Zhou Xieji, Xinsheng, Tongle, Shiyin, and Anding radio stations in this city to stop broadcasting by the end of this month. As for the reasons for the Ministry of Communications' suspension of the eight radio stations this time, it is heard that on the one hand, the number of radio stations in this city is too large, affecting radio waves, so it is necessary to reduce the number of radio stations in this city. Secondly, because two of the eight radio stations have special circumstances that require them to be banned, the remaining six radio stations are ordered to stop broadcasting because their equipment is simple and there are too many deficiencies.</p>
<p>Broadcasting Industry Association Expresses</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications stated that the ban on Dunben and other radio stations was indeed a fact. According to the person in charge of the Broadcasting Association, the association has received reports from various stations requesting to forward the request for relief. The reasons for the removal this time are mostly that they have had a license for many years but have not obtained a new one, the equipment is simple, and the broadcasting interferes with other stations. According to the term of the permit, it is indeed only six months, but there are still many private radio stations that have not obtained a license. Previously, in the 24th year of the Republic, the association collected documents and guarantees from various member radio stations for collective application, but at that time, the Telecommunications Bureau stated that there was no appropriate method and only ordered the documents to be stored, which cannot be regarded as the negligence of the radio stations. As for the issue of equipment, there are no explicit regulations in the regulations on the ban of private radio stations, and the equipment drawings of each radio station must be submitted for review in advance. After approval, they can be built, and then they must be submitted for inspection and verification. Only after passing the inspection can they be allowed to broadcast. If there are instructions to add equipment, they will also be followed. However, private radio stations cannot be compared with state-owned equipment due to capital relations. Regarding the issue of interference, the power of the eight radio stations is not strong, and one of them has not yet found a suitable location since last year due to the demolition of the building and has not yet broadcast. It seems that there is no possibility of interference. Considering the above situation, there is no intention to violate the regulations. The authorities may have misunderstandings. Moreover, private radio stations rely on business for maintenance, and manufacturing equipment cannot be done without thousands of gold. Once they are ordered to stop broadcasting, their equipment cannot be transferred like other businesses. How can they properly manage it? The association has submitted the above situation to the Ministry of Communications and the Central Broadcasting Industry Guidance Committee, requesting that they be considerate of the difficulties of the business and first issue equipment standards so that private radio stations can know what to follow and reduce losses.</p>
<p>Investigation of Broadcasting Personnel Completed</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the level of all broadcasting personnel in the radio stations in this city varies greatly, and the choice of topics has a great impact on the thoughts and lives of the masses, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau recently prepared a form, distributed for investigation, and paid the most attention to the education level. The results showed that among the 457 people, 159 came from private schools, accounting for one-third of all personnel in the broadcasting industry; 99 came from elementary schools, accounting for one-fifth of all personnel, of which 74 graduated from elementary school; 120 came from middle schools, accounting for one-quarter of all personnel; 18 received university education, accounting for one-twenty-fifth of the total; and 61 were illiterate and uneducated. Therefore, the education level of the broadcasting personnel in this city is not uniform, and the authorities believe that it is necessary to find a way to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau Increases Ham Freight</h3>
<p>Freight Rate Increased by 40 Cents per Piece</p>
<p>The Association Requests to Charge at the Old Rate</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau has changed ham, which was originally listed as fourth-class cargo, to third-class cargo for transportation fees since the 26th year of the Republic, resulting in an increase of 40 cents per piece. The Ham Industry Association of this city received reports from its members yesterday and sent a letter to the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, requesting that the fees be charged at the original rate. The letter stated, "Dear Sirs, we have recently learned from our member, Bei Wan You Quan Ham Store, that they received a notice from the Hangzhou Transportation Company that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau raised the freight rate for ham by one level on January 1 of this year, changing it to third class (originally fourth class), increasing the freight rate by 40 cents per piece compared to the previous time. Our association was shocked to receive the report. Ham is originally a rural sideline product. At a time when the rural economy is collapsing, the government should support and promote agricultural products. Now, if the transportation price is arbitrarily increased, it is tantamount to directly increasing the cost of the item and indirectly affecting sales. This facility is deeply inconsistent with the original intention of the authorities to develop agricultural products on a daily basis. We dare to submit the facts and hope that your bureau will still charge the freight for ham according to the original price of fourth-class cargo. We will be very grateful and hope for a reply to avoid misfortune."</p>
<h3>Two Money Shops and Huafeng Company Announce Closure</h3>
<p>The Two Shops Are Liquidating Separately</p>
<p>Huafeng Will Discuss the Aftermath</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that Yuanzi Money Shop Xiehe Qinji, Hengzi Money Shop Fengrun, and Huafeng Business Company announced their closure the day before yesterday and separately entrusted lawyers to liquidate. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Xiehe Qinji</p>
<p>Xiehe Qinji Money Shop is a Yuanzi-numbered shop in Shanghai, located at No. 13 Ruyi Li, Henan Road and Beijing Road. The manager is Luo Guixiang, and the associate is Liu Yusheng. After the reorganization two years ago, the capital was 140,000 yuan. Now, affected by the economic downturn, deposits have gradually decreased, and loans that have been issued are difficult to recover. Due to the closure of Huafeng Business Company, it had no choice but to announce its closure the night before yesterday and entrusted lawyer Dai Menghan to liquidate. The announcement stated, "According to Xiehe Qinji Shop, the shop is temporarily unable to circulate due to the impact of the market, and is forced to stop business for liquidation, entrusting a representative to handle it. Therefore, the representative is announcing that all holders of the shop's promissory notes should return the notes for the original basis. All depositors and debtors should register at the office within 14 days for verification and liquidation. Please do not delay. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>Runfeng Money Shop</p>
<p>Runfeng Money Shop is a Hengzi-numbered shop in Shanghai, located at No. 23 Ruyi Li, Henan Road and Beijing Road, with a capital of 30,000 yuan. The manager is Wang Yuncheng, and the associate is Chang Baichun. Its main business is to receive secret-marked coupons, etc. Now, affected by the closure of Huafeng Business Company, it could not be maintained the night before yesterday and had no choice but to announce its closure. It entrusted lawyer Shan Yuhua to liquidate. The announcement stated, "According to the manager of Runfeng Money Shop, the shop has been affected by the economic downturn and will stop business from today. The liquidator owes debts to various people. Please trouble your lawyer to represent and notify all creditor and debtor accounts to register within 14 days, bring the proof to the office for registration. Debtors are also limited to 14 days to come and repay, and take a receipt. Please do not delay and be sued. Therefore, a special representative notice is given as right."</p>
<p>Huafeng Company</p>
<p>Huafeng Business Company is located at No. 15 Ruyi Li, Henan Road and Beijing Road, with a capital of 100,000 yuan. The manager is Wang Yuncheng. Its business is the same as a silver company, and it also absorbs deposits. Now, due to business failure, it announced its closure on the 20th and entrusted lawyer Shan Yuhua to announce at the door, "According to the representative of the above-mentioned party, the company is currently affected by the changes of debtors and has to temporarily stop business. Once the shareholders' meeting decides whether to resume business, a formal announcement will be made. We ask your lawyer to represent the announcement. The lawyer has checked and verified the facts and hereby publishes the announcement on January 20, 1937."</p>
<p>Reasons for Closure</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned from the Qian industry yesterday that Luo Guixiang, the manager of Xiehe Shop, and Wang Yuncheng, the manager of Runfeng Shop, jointly opened Huafeng Business Company. Its business is to receive bank secret-marked coupons and operate securities trading, agency insurance, etc. Now, due to business failure, it has a large debt and cannot be maintained. Xiehe and Runfeng shops were implicated and closed at the same time, but it has nothing to do with the entire finance.</p>
<h3>The First Day of the Exhibition to Support Sui and He Was a Great Success</h3>
<p>The Collection Exhibition of Greeting Cards by Mr. Yu Dani, the Director of Education of the Louis Elementary School on Tianzhutang Street outside the New North Gate of this city, opened yesterday. The content was rich, and the layout was elegant. More than 10,000 kinds of artistic greeting cards were divided into 16 categories and displayed in 10 classrooms, which was a feast for the eyes. Although the weather was gloomy and cold, the visitors kept coming. The cartoonist Mr. Lu Shaofei lingered and appreciated in the venue for three hours and still sighed that it was like riding a horse and looking at flowers and could not fully appreciate it. A Japanese scholar, Mr. Jian Saburo, also bought a ticket to enter the exhibition. He was very moved to see the tragic situation of the wounded soldiers in Suiyuan. He expressed his extreme dissatisfaction with the brutal and cruel behavior of his country's warlords, believing that China has a long culture, vast land, abundant resources, and a large population. China and Japan can only achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity if they are friendly and work together. If they use military aggression, carry out bombing, and kill the same kind, it will not only cause Chinese resentment but also be intolerable to heaven. After appreciating it, Mr. Jian expressed his admiration for Mr. Yu's artistic cultivation. After learning that Mr. Yu was a Catholic monk, he wrote the words "The Realm of Happiness and Joy" and left it as a souvenir. In addition, many people from Henan Zhumadian Bishop Wang Bolu and the news and art circles came to visit. Dr. Yu Bin, the Bishop of Nanjing, sent a special telegram from Guangzhou to congratulate the success. Fei Huaiyong, the Dean of Guisui Public Hospital, also sent a letter of congratulation and thanked on behalf of the wounded soldiers in the hospital.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Pisi Tobacco Industry Association Submits to the Guangdong Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Please Order the Repeal</p>
<p>of the Tobacco Floss Transit Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pisi Tobacco Industry Association believes that since the unification has been completed, the national government stipulates one tax for one item, which should be implemented to comply with the decree and reduce the burden. Therefore, it submitted a request to the Guangdong Provincial Government yesterday, requesting that it order the repeal of the tobacco floss transit tax in Guangdong Province. The original submission is as follows, "For the matter of earnestly requesting an order to repeal the tobacco floss transit tax in Guangdong Province, in order to alleviate business difficulties and comply with the decree, it is reported that the association has repeatedly received letters from various members stating that merchants are engaged in Fujian tobacco floss, which is collected from Yongding, Fujian, and transferred through Dabu, Chaozhou, etc., due to geographical advantages. It has already paid the special tax in Yongding, the place of origin. In the past, Chen Jitang, the governor of Guangdong, was extremely greedy and levied heavily on everything. When tobacco floss was transported through Guangdong, he extorted exorbitant taxes, called transit tax. At that time, due to the special circumstances in Guangdong and Guangxi, there was nothing that could be done. Now that the unification has been completed, the Guangdong provincial tax administration will follow the decrees of the central national government and stipulate one tax for one item. Since the tobacco floss has been taxed in the place of origin, the above transit tax should no longer be levied. However, the actual collection is still the same and has not been repealed. Since the establishment of this industry in recent years, it has been ravaged by the communist bandits internally and attacked by the prevalence of cigarettes externally. With internal and external difficulties, even if the government abolishes the harsh taxes and increases the donations and taxes, it is still feared that it will not be able to maintain it. If it is burdened again and again, it will inevitably be on the verge of extinction. Moreover, the sales of tobacco floss are extremely small, and what is the benefit to the provincial treasury from the dribs and drabs of transit tax revenue? It only makes the transport of goods obstructed and the business is more difficult. The association requests that it be forwarded to the Guangdong Provincial Government, which will order the immediate repeal of the transit tax to alleviate business difficulties and comply with the decree. It is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<h3>Renji Hospital December Report</h3>
<p>Renji Hospital recently released its report for December of last year, stating that there were 12,985 outpatient visits, 337 new inpatients, 6,871 inpatient days, an average of 440 patients fed daily, 48 male suicides, 41 female suicides, 242 emergency surgical cases, 61 emergency surgical cases due to factory accidents, 271 patients sent by the Public Concession Police, 40 patients sent by the French Concession Police, 16 patients sent by the Chinese Public Security Bureau, 33 deliveries, 13,322 prescriptions filled, and 443 X-ray examinations.  These statistics show that the hospital's work is progressing according to the usual seasonal patterns. Specifically, the number of inpatients increased from 323 in the previous month to 337 in December, and the number of inpatient days increased from 6,434 in November to 6,871 in December. Emergency surgical cases due to factory accidents increased by 20 percent, which may be attributed to the increased industrial activity in Shanghai. Another lamentable phenomenon in December's work was the increase in female suicides, from 33 in November to 41 in December.  One encouraging aspect of the work is the increase in deliveries, with 33 recorded in the past month.  The obstetrics department is developing so rapidly that, if this growth continues, a pre-registration system for inpatient deliveries will be necessary in the future. Looking back on the past month, the hospital particularly feels the need for charitable organizations to accommodate impoverished patients after their discharge. It is distressing to see patients who have been cured discharged from the hospital only to have no home or job, especially during these cold winter months. This social issue is a serious problem for the hospital's work, although it is not entirely related to the hospital's core mission. Strictly speaking, the hospital's work is done once the patient is cured. However, if the patient is unable to obtain adequate means of living after leaving the hospital, the hospital's achievements in curing them will be rendered useless. The hospital sincerely hopes that charitable organizations can provide assistance in this regard. December, being a month with a strong Christmas atmosphere, saw the hospital receive special donations and assistance, enabling it to provide excellent care for patients throughout the past year. The hospital is deeply grateful. The children in the pediatric ward were able to enjoy gifts and candy. The hospital hopes that the harmonious atmosphere that filled the hospital during Christmas was able to provide real comfort to patients and staff, and to create a happy and lasting memory for them.</p>
<h3>Suma Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Returning to His Country on the Toyo Maru on the 23rd</p>
<p>Suma, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy in China and concurrently the Consul-General stationed in Beijing, was recalled to his country and arrived in Shanghai at approximately 1:00 PM yesterday, having taken an early express train from Beijing. After disembarking at the North Station, he went to his lodgings to rest. He then visited Ambassador Kawagoe at the Consulate-General. It was decided that he would depart for his country with his family at 6:00 AM on the 23rd aboard the Toyo Maru.</p>
<h3>Robbers Posing as Telephone Inspectors Commit Robbery</h3>
<p>At approximately 9:45 AM yesterday, five robbers suddenly arrived at the home of Mr. Zhang, the owner of the Daye Printing Company located at No. 305 Pingliang Road.  They falsely claimed to be telephone company inspectors to gain entry to the house, and then proceeded to rob it. Two of the robbers were armed with Brownings, and one carried a Mauser pistol. They first confined Mr. Zhang's family members, and then forced them to hand over the keys to important boxes.  They began searching and looting, and left with their loot after about half an hour, escaping in a chartered car that had been waiting by the roadside. By the time the victim chased after them, the car was long gone, and the car's license plate number and other details could not be determined. Upon checking the losses, they amounted to over three thousand yuan. He then filed a detailed report with the Yulin Road Police Station, requesting an investigation and pursuit. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched detectives to investigate the scene and inquire about the appearance of the robbers and the color of the car, in order to track them down.</p>
<h3>Shui Mu Workers Brawl at Xi Jinji Construction Plant</h3>
<p>Shi Folang Dies from Head Injuries</p>
<p>Wang Wenkui Makes Every Effort to Provide Medical Attention</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, a brawl broke out between the plasterers and carpenters employed by the Xi Jinji Construction Plant at the intersection of Zhizaoju Road and Hui Ning Road in the Nanshi area. The fight was triggered by a minor dispute over wood planks. As a result, Shi Folang (a 40-year-old man from Chongming, also known as Monk) and Wang Wenkui (a 39-year-old man from Pudong) both suffered severe head injuries from axe wounds. Upon learning of the incident, the local police station dispatched officers to the scene and detained 18 workers involved in the incident, including Yan Shukui and Li Liu'er, for interrogation. The injured were taken to the Shanghai South Bethel Hospital for treatment. However, Shi Folang, the carpenter, eventually succumbed to his head injuries and excessive blood loss. He died at 3:00 AM yesterday. The hospital reported the death to the police station, which ordered the local warden to request an autopsy from the local court. The seriously injured worker, Wang Wenkui, is currently receiving intensive medical treatment and is expected to survive.</p>
<h3>Fire on Tiantong Road</h3>
<p>Old Clerk Burned</p>
<p>At approximately 8:30 PM last night, a fire broke out at Wanheng Sauce Garden, located at No. 856 to 858, at the intersection of Tiantong Road and North Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession. The flames quickly spread through the roof, becoming uncontrollable. During the fire, an old clerk from the sauce garden, a Ningbo native, 44 years old, escaped from the inferno but suffered burns to both legs, which were quite severe. He was subsequently transported to Baolong Hospital by ambulance for treatment. The fire department dispatched a fire engine to the scene and extinguished the blaze after some time. As a result, two buildings were destroyed by the fire.</p>
<h3>Dockworkers and Patrolmen Clash Violently</h3>
<p>Both Sides Suffer Injuries</p>
<p>Luo Zhongxiu, a dockworker for the Sanbei Company at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong, accidentally bumped into patrolman Yang Wanlin while carrying goods from a ship to the wharf at 1:00 PM yesterday, leading to a verbal altercation. The patrolman then reprimanded the dockworker, and the dockworkers gathered a crowd to make trouble for the patrolmen. The patrolmen did not back down either, and a fierce fight ensued. As a result, Luo Zhongxiu was seriously injured on the workers' side, while Yang Wanlin suffered a head injury on the patrolmen's side. Wang Dekun also suffered injuries to his right hand and face. The incident was reported to the Pudong Branch Bureau, which dispatched detectives Li Xinheng and police chief Zhang Zifang to investigate the scene. The crowd dispersed, and Luo was sent to Pudong Hospital for treatment, while Yang Wanlin and Wang Dekun were taken to the bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Harmony Agreement to Be Signed Today in Jardine Matheson Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She states that the labor dispute between the managers and employees of the various ships of the British-owned Jardine Matheson Shipping Company has been largely resolved through the mediation of the Chinese Seamen's Union and its Shanghai branch. Therefore, the Seamen's Union has specifically scheduled a meeting today to convene responsible representatives from both sides to sign a contract, so that they can unite and comply with the already notified arrangements for both parties to review and implement.</p>
<h3>Wu Qigen and Others Convicted of Illegally Detaining Female Guide</h3>
<p>Zhang Ying, a female employee of the Tiansheng Guide Agency located in the Gongqing Building on Hankou Road, was summoned by Wu Qigen, Chen Yonglin, Zhang Asheng, and others to Room 110 of the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road at 6:00 PM on the 13th of this month. They made all sorts of jokes and attempted to assault her, causing Zhang to cry out in distress. Wu and the others, considering this to be inauspicious, invited the manager of the guide agency, Li Lili, to come and threatened her with dangerous words, attempting to extort twenty yuan. Li managed to report the matter to the Lao Zha Police Station, which ordered detective Song Wenqing to arrest Wu and the other three. The details of their delivery to the First Special District Court for interrogation have been previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court declared the judgment in the First Criminal Court. Wu Qigen and Chen Yonglin were each sentenced to 15 days of detention for jointly and illegally depriving others of their freedom of movement. Zhang Asheng, as a recidivist, was sentenced to 30 days of detention for the same crime, as a warning.</p>
<h3>Zhao Shigu's Achievements in Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhao Shigu, a German-trained physician residing at No. 14 Daodali, Avni Road, is a specialist in cardiology and internal medicine. He excels in curing addiction to narcotics, always achieving remarkable results. Recently, Mr. Sun Jianyin, the respected father of Mrs. Zhou Sizhong of the China Travel Service, who was employed by the Jinpu Railway, suffered from a weak constitution and a multitude of ailments due to overwork. He consulted numerous Chinese and foreign doctors, but with little success. Upon hearing of Dr. Zhao's expertise in treating various ailments, he sought treatment from him and was cured within a month. His health has improved daily, and his spirits are high. Dr. Zhao truly deserves to be called a renowned physician of our time.</p>

<h3>Italian Consulate Requested Ban on Abyssinia Film</h3>
<p>Shanghai Grand Theatre Ignores Request Based on Central Inspection Approval</p>
<p>Authorities Sent Police to Suppress Concerns of Disputes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grand Theatre, located at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road, began showing the "Abyssinia Film" at 3:00 PM yesterday. The film had already been approved and licensed by the Central Film Censorship Committee, so there were naturally no major issues. However, the Italian Consulate in Shanghai learned of this and requested that the authorities ban the showing. The authorities reasoned that since the film had already been approved by the Central Film Censorship Committee, there was no reason to prohibit it. However, given the previous incident where a certain film shown at the Paris Theatre on Avenue Joffre (now Huaihai Road) had angered Italian expatriates, who then seized and burned the film, causing a major dispute, they were concerned about a similar incident occurring. Therefore, Liang Fuchu, the chief of the North Station Branch Bureau, led eight police officers to suppress any potential unrest inside and outside the theatre. A reporter from Xin Sheng She, who attended the 3:00 PM showing yesterday, learned that the film was produced by the Soviet Film News Factory. One part depicted the customs and geography of Abyssinia, including its various resources such as gold mines, silver mines, coal mines, and oil fields, as well as important military locations and the harsh conditions of Abyssinian farmers. The other part depicted the Italo-Abyssinian War that began on December 5, 1934, with the Italian army launching attacks from Eritreli and Samali, and the Abyssinians resisting with swords, spears, sticks, and clubs against airplanes and artillery, including the Italian bombing. The film was entirely a newsreel.</p>
<h3>Woman Abuses Child to Death</h3>
<p>Police Prosecute Based on Neighbor's Testimony</p>
<p>Hearing Adjourned for Rescheduling</p>
<p>Ji Longcai, a 42-year-old man from Zhenjiang, married a woman surnamed Wang (39 years old this year) from Yangzhou. Ji works as a cabin officer on a Taikoo Company ship in Hubei. Wang lives in the east wing of A-10 Tongan Lane, Lao Yong'an Street, in the French Concession. Because she only gave birth to daughters and not sons, she adopted a one-year-old boy as her son five years ago, naming him Fuxiang. He is now five years old. However, Wang has a violent temper and does not treat the child well, often abusing him. Starting on the 8th of this month, the child suddenly developed a fever and rash. Instead of seeking medical treatment, Wang beat the child when he cried, and even used a red-hot iron to burn his right leg. As a result, the child's illness and injuries gradually worsened, and he died at 2:30 PM on the 15th of this month. Wang then planned to buy a coffin and hastily bury him. Neighbors, feeling that this was unjust, reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. They arrested Wang and sent the body to the coroner's office. Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court conducted an autopsy and determined that Ji Fuxiang died from the burn injuries. The details have been previously reported in this newspaper. The police have now sent Wang to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Sun Pengham presided over the First Criminal Court to hear the case. Lawyer Yuan Jiahong of the police department prosecuted her for the crime of causing death by injury under Article 277 of the Criminal Law. Witnesses, including the landlord Zhu Run'an and the neighbor Sun Yuming, testified about the defendant's abuse of the child. When questioned, Ji Wang denied abusing the child, claiming that he had measles for seven days and that she was unable to afford medical treatment, seeking ineffective folk remedies until he died. She also retained a lawyer to defend her. After reviewing the evidence, the court adjourned the hearing to 2:00 PM on January 28th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>"A Rare Phenomenon in Twenty Years"</h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>The international edition of this newspaper on the 19th published alarming news about the naval arms race among various maritime powers, stating that the current surge in warship construction is unprecedented in the last twenty years. Even the "naval hegemon" Great Britain has a staggering budget to build ninety-nine ships. It is no wonder that the general public is taken aback by this news. Although 1936 did not truly become the year of a second world war as predicted by some, the world is shrouded in war clouds, and the increasing antagonism between the democratic and fascist camps, as well as the feverish expansion of armaments by various countries, have made people worry about the coming year of 1937. Although at the beginning of the new year, Eden echoed Baldwin's statement that "this year is a year of peace," saying "we would rather have butter than guns," the expiration of naval reduction agreements, coupled with the thickening atmosphere of gunpowder stirred up by the "three giants," has forced even Great Britain, the old empire that repeatedly declares peace, to build more warships in order to consolidate its naval empire. Therefore, although the phrase "a rare phenomenon in twenty years" sounds a bit alarming, it has become something expected. Let us take a look at a piece of gossip news in the important news section of this newspaper on the 14th, which will make you feel that these "rare phenomena" are "not so rare." The news is as follows:</p>
<p>"Krupp Steel Company shareholders can receive a dividend of 4%, which is an unprecedented phenomenon for the company in the last twenty years. The company's total capital is 160 million marks. In the fiscal year 1934-1935, the profit was 9.7 million marks. In the fiscal year 1935-1936, the profit was 14.4 million marks, accounting for 9% of the capital. In addition to the 4% dividend distributed to shareholders, the remaining 5%, or 8 million marks, is used as a reserve fund. However, the increase in the company's reserve fund this year is actually 20 million marks, indicating that the actual profit is more than 14.4 million marks..."</p>
<p>What kind of guy is Krupp Armaments Factory? It is believed that everyone knows. It is German, no, it is the world's largest arms dealer. During World War I, it fattened its big belly by sucking the blood of kind people of various races on the battlefield. Today, in the new year of 1937, this bloodsucker has announced its total profit. The profit amount of 14.4 million marks is believed to be no small amount, not to mention that the "actual amount" is even more than this number. From this profit amount, we can probably smell a gunpowder smell that is stronger than that of 1936. The tragic scene of skulls piled up like a mountain is vaguely in front of people again. Who is the manufacturer of war? Here, his hideous face is fully revealed. The little dove of peace disappeared and sank in the fog of poison gas, never to raise its head again!</p>
<p>Let us think about it carefully. The so-called "twenty years" does it not mean that the world has now reached the time of 1914, when the great powers divided up the colonies? There has been no such good business in the past twenty years. That is because the European war was exhausting. Now it is 1937! Yes! Twenty years! The call for the redistribution of world colonies has been shouted out and partially implemented by the "three giants." How can we blame the Krupp Company for making a lot of money and daring to say that it is a "rare phenomenon in twenty years"? Is this not the sinister laugh of people who profit from war?</p>
<p>War, it seems, is very difficult to avoid. Not only are the major powers, who shout "peace" in their mouths, preparing for war so frantically, but the "three giants" have already reached the point of "death if they do not fight." Therefore, if we, the weak and small nations, want to long for peace, the first thing we must do is use the war of resistance to eliminate the ambitious war of aggression. "A rare phenomenon in twenty years," that's right, perhaps the weak and small nations' war of resistance against the god of war will be a rare phenomenon in history!</p>
<h3>Breaking the Ice for Fish</h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>Snow was falling, and the sky was dawning dimly.</p>
<p>The village was quiet. The snow silently turned the fields into a silvery, shimmering expanse. The wind gradually died down. People were going to the market, the sky still gloomy.</p>
<p>The vegetable vendor carried two large baskets of cabbage, the snow crunching under his feet. Under the white felt hat with large earflaps, a square, purplish-black face was revealed. He walked for a while, blew his nose with his large hand, took a breath, blankly looked at the distant snowy path, changed the carrying position of his load, and then walked step by step.</p>
<p>In the sorghum stalk fence at the head of the bridge was a small, two-room restaurant built of reeds. Thick gray smoke billowed from the chimney on the roof. The wooden door was half open, and a waiter who had just woken up came out to hang the white wooden sign, which read "Meat and Vegetable Noodles, Sesame Seed Cakes". After hanging it up, the waiter looked into the distance. From across the bridge, the intermittent sound of a bell drifted over, crisp and clear, cutting through the freezing morning wind. A merchant from the city, out collecting debts, jumped down from the back of his donkey, huddled in a ball.</p>
<p>"Hey, excuse me, could you tell me which street Zhang Junqing lives on in the village?"</p>
<p>"East Street, black gate, across from the pharmacy. Won't you eat something?"</p>
<p>"No, I'll eat when I come back after settling the accounts."</p>
<p>"Going to the countryside to collect debts in this weather."</p>
<p>The waiter said to himself, watching the merchant enter the village on his little black donkey. He also idly</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>went back inside.</p>
<p>People were fetching water by the river, and the sky was brighter. The charcoal factory with the iron gates was also opened. The cook carried a pair of buckets down the slope, humming, "Tenth and twelfth lunar months, so cold, a widow's heart, half empty..." A black dog followed behind him, sniffing at the wet spots on the snow, suddenly, a series of sounds, like the breaking of glass, came from the center of the river, and the dog howled, and the cook looked over there, muttering to himself:</p>
<p>"Breaking the ice for fish in this cold weather, good lad!"</p>
<p>An old man and a young man lit a fire on the riverbank. The large firewood burned in two-foot-high flames. In the center of the river on the thick ice, there was a fellow with an ice drill, drilling holes in the ice. He had drawn a three-foot square circle on the ice, and the dazzling one-foot-high drill bit was moving back and forth on the ice surface. After a while, a large piece of ice was suddenly knocked far away, tinkling like rain, but it was blocked by the fluffy snow. The ice was slowly broken, and a square of emerald water flowed under the thick ice layer. The old man guarding the fire saw the ice-drilling man standing there wiping sweat, and knew that he had broken through, so he said:</p>
<p>"Second brother, is it through?"</p>
<p>"It's through!" he said, picking up the ice drill and walking towards the fire.</p>
<p>The young man in his twenties standing opposite the old man was now stark naked, with a long-haired old sheepskin coat draped over his shoulders. He had tied a leather pocket, as large as a pair of shorts, around his legs. The old man took a pig bladder soaked in pig's blood and wrapped it around his hair. He himself put on small iron rings on the thumb, middle finger, and ring finger of his right hand, each extending an inch-high, very sharp curved knife from his nails. He squatted by the fire, picked up the big-bellied black porcelain wine bottle, swallowed a few mouthfuls of liquor as if drinking cold water, wiped his lips, and said to the ice-drilling man with the sheepskin coat:</p>
<p>"Second brother, shall we go down?"</p>
<p>With a flash, he threw the sheepskin coat on the snow, took a big step to the ice hole, and put his hands on the ice layer that had been cut without any sharp edges, and jumped down. The second brother quickly ran over and looked down, leaning over the ice hole with both hands holding the ice drill, watching his brother move in the freezing ice water with his generations of experience. The old man guarding the fire also came over at this time. He loved his son who was suffering from the cold ice. He had experienced the skin-splitting pain of that kind of life in the ice water, and he trembled as he exhorted the older son:</p>
<p>"Second, be careful, be careful, how is it?"</p>
<p>The son waved his hand and walked to the side of the hole. A hand suddenly stretched out of the water, and a large fish weighing six or seven pounds was thrown onto the snow. The fish jumped around anxiously, panting, and soon became quiet. The old man happily grabbed the fish, walked back to the fire, and put it in the large leather bag filled with water.</p>
<p>At this time, the young man who was as strong as a leopard had climbed out of the ice cave, and the older brother put the sheepskin coat on him. Everyone forgot that snow powder was still floating in the sky. They ran, and when they got close to the fire, the older brother stuck the ice drill in the ground and helped his younger brother to untie the cumbersome fish pocket. The father used a dry cloth to wipe his body, wiped him dry, and applied the liquor. He squatted by the fire, rubbing the skin of his body with his hands as he roasted.</p>
<p>When the father stood behind him and untied the pig blood bladder on his head, the thin ice that had condensed on it fell down like broken glass. The three men looked at the fish pocket, full of fish, and smiled silently. The older brother was taking off his cotton coat, preparing to jump into the ice cave for the second time to fill the other two fish pockets. The father said:</p>
<p>"Enough to buy a bushel of millet."</p>
<p>The two sons said at the same time:</p>
<p>"It's the end of the year, and many small debts have not been repaid yet."</p>
<h3>The Magic of Photoelectric Cells (Electric Eyes) (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>The earliest photoelectric cells had only a metal plate that served as one electrode when exposed to light. Part of it was housed in a metal container, forming another electrode, with the space in between filled with air at atmospheric pressure. Today's photoelectric cells use a photosensitive metal plate, or a layer of gold foil inside a glass bulb, as the first electrode, and another metal plate as the second electrode. Both electrodes are sealed in a glass tube, with the air density inside being less than one millionth of the initial photoelectric cell. The electricity generated by that photoelectric cell is extremely minute. If not for the later invention of the triode vacuum tube, which gradually reached perfection and amplified the minute electrical power enough to operate relays or indicators, the cell could never be applied as it is today.</p>
<p>In factories that mass-produce goods, the cell can be used to count items. Counting red-hot steel ingots passing through a certain temperature with the human eye would surely cause dizziness. If a mechanical counter were used, the heat would destroy it. At this point, only an "electric eye" can count the number, distinguish colors, and separate sizes and types. The "electric eye" can compensate for all the shortcomings of machinery. The "electric eye" can temper steel bars at a certain temperature, heat them to a certain red color, take them out of the furnace, and perform other industrial uses.</p>
<p>Both the transmitting and receiving ends of a telephoto machine rely on the power of photoelectric cells. The first telephoto machine, invented by an obscure German experimentalist named Nipkow in 1884, was merely a very crude mechanical spinning disc. It then stagnated for forty years before the combined application of the "electric eye" was known. Initially, it could only produce a very faint image in the laboratory, but after rapid progress, it became an almost continuous picture in the human eye. The latest and most complete telephoto machine was invented by Zworykin, and it is a photoelectric cell like the human eye. That battery, like the human eye, can emit a complete image, but this is the effect of electron scattering. At the receiving end, it converts the electron impulses into light and shadows, and simultaneously presents the entire image.</p>
<p>Sound movies use a precisely measured beam of light emitted from an exciter lamp. That light passes through the sound track on the film according to optical laws and shines on the photosensitive surface of the cell. Because the amount of light contacting the sound track is consistent and unchanging, the parts of the sound track that cannot be transmitted vary with the amount of light shining on the cell surface. The appropriately measured stream, after being amplified, is sent to the sound reproducer, which emits various sounds.</p>
<p>The tunnel under the Hudson River in the Netherlands uses photoelectric relays to count the number of cars passing through the tunnel. The Ambassador Bridge in Detroit, USA, also uses this method to count vehicles crossing the bridge. Large department stores in New York City use photoelectric cells for advertising. When pedestrians approach the glass window displaying goods, they interrupt the light beam, and the relay immediately activates, and an advertisement appears inside the window for a few minutes. When there is no one around, the advertisement does not light up, which is also an economical method. Another use is as a smoke indicator and recorder in a factory, thus preventing fuel waste. Dangerous machines, using photoelectric cell methods, can protect workers from accidental danger. If a worker is too close to the machine, interrupting the light beam, the machine will immediately stop moving or emit a warning sound. Skyscrapers can use photoelectric cells to make elevators go up and down automatically, without the need for a operator. Rooms storing flammable materials are equipped with "electric eyes," and they can detect even a wisp of smoke, immediately sound an alarm, or spray fire extinguishing liquid. Schools and libraries, with photoelectric cells, will automatically turn on the lights when the room gets dark. Paper mills with photoelectric cells can limit the thickness of the paper, and if the thickness is excessive or insufficient, or the paper surface is broken, it will issue a warning. It can operate traffic lights at road intersections. It can check the quality of eggs and sort eggs of different sizes one by one. There is no telling how many more uses there are for this kind of delicate work. (The End)</p>

<p>Opening "Farewell Phoenix"</p>
<p>It's hard to meet and even harder to part. I never imagined I'd be seeing you off today. The willows along the ten-mile long embankment follow the wind. All blowing towards the departing traveler's face. Thinking of you, a handsome young man untainted by the world. Song Yu is amorous and delights in recovering himself. Heroines in women's attire and beauties in boudoirs. Who wouldn't admire your talent. Who knew you, wouldn't dislike this humble and poor woman. Entering a humble dwelling, you bestow an appreciative eye. Affection is heavy as a mountain, kindness like the sea. Helping with studies like severing metal, joyfully cultivating. Unexpectedly, there is illness in the high hall requiring decoctions. No one to serve day and night. Therefore, I, urged by telegrams, hasten the journey. Lingering farewell words at the long pavilion. Only hearing that, the Yangguan three stacks sing a sorrowful tune. Shaking hands reluctantly, tears filling the face. I wish you, silently pray that the gods will protect and assist. That the northern hall daylily returns early in spring. I wish you, to cherish yourself when the weather is cold or warm. That the traveler's hardships will feel especially cold. I wish you, a good match destined by the old man under the moon. Plan early and seek out a matchmaker. I wish you, not to break off correspondence. Don't let this slave girl sleep restlessly. Know that I, sit in a sorrowful city, my heart unsettled. Looking towards you over ten thousand miles of cloud-covered mountains. Although it is, the scenery of home is endlessly good. It can't compare to, the North Sea Tian Tan where you can fully express yourself. But I, do not dislike my meticulous admonishments. Each word contains hardship and soreness. Words reaching deep emotion, the intestines are about to break. Words that are unsaid, difficult to say. Today, tears of longing do not dry.</p>

Although your master is ill. He should, seek treatment and medicine and invite a doctor. It has nothing to do with my young mistress. Where can I get magic medicine to save your master. Sister, this illness definitely needs the young mistress to save him. I will, go with you to the study to see my master. I guarantee he will immediately feel better.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications (-1300) invites Mr. Li Jiqing to give a lecture on "Talking about the situation in Europe and the United States" from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM today, Mr. Zhang Kunyu will speak on "Common Sense of Telegraphs" from 5:00 PM to 5:15 PM, and Professor Ge Shouyuan will give an academic lecture from 5:15 PM to 5:30 PM. I hope all sectors will pay attention at that time.</p>
<p>The Yacheng Harmonica Society of this port is an amateur harmonica music group. Since its establishment, it has been more than a year. The society has broadcasted on major radio stations before, and has received enthusiastic welcome from all walks of life. Later, due to the increasing busyness of the association, it was unable to take care of broadcasting. Now it is heard that the association has received letters from all walks of life requesting it, and has decided to broadcast harmonica music on the Zhongyan (ie China) radio station every Sunday afternoon from 1:15 PM to 2:30 PM, which is a gospel for harmonica lovers.</p>
<p>To whom it may concern, I was deeply shocked to read in your newspaper on the 19th of this month that the "Beilei Troupe" broadcasted singing at the Yadong Radio Station. I have checked that the Bi Xuan Arrow has broadcasted on major radio stations before, but recently I stopped broadcasting for more than a month because of my health. The programs published in your newspaper were not sent by our troupe. If there are any programs to be offered in the future, they will be based on the rules of the troupe, so as to avoid causing misunderstanding. This matter concerns the reputation of our troupe, so I am sending this letter urgently, hoping that your newspaper will correct it. Respectfully, Zhang Mingzong, Beilei Opera Troupe.</p>

<h3>Paramount Celebrates 25th Anniversary with Special Contribution "Perfect Match"</h3>
<p>Screening at the Great Light Theater starting today</p>
<p>Mr. Zuke, chairman of Paramount Pictures, has served the company for 25 years and has produced a large number of beautiful films for release to commemorate the occasion. His film "Champagne Waltz" is scheduled to be screened simultaneously in major theaters around the world on the 22nd of this month. The Great Light Theater in this port will also start screening this film today. The film stars three major stars, Klandaish Huasha, Flint McCumolai, and Biggo Okay, and is a musical song and dance romance film comparable to "The Merry Widow." The content includes a mixed performance of jazz music and waltz music, a grand performance of ancient dance art and the new era dance art, and the greatness and novelty of the song and dance scene are indeed worthy of praise, and the acting skills of the two major stars are also quite rare. The picture above is a small portrait of Mr. Zhu.</p>
<h3>Ouyang Feili as a Guide</h3>
<p>Miss Ouyang Feili, who used to broadcast on the radio and has now officially joined the film company as an actress, once acted as a guide in Tianyi.</p>
<p>The fact is that "Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money," directed by Zuo Ming, is an exposing comedy that tries to collect various phenomena of the current society, and the female guide is a kind of plaything popular in Shanghai nowadays. Their footprints can be found everywhere, whether it is tea houses, restaurants, dance halls or hostels. Therefore, Zuo Ming also included the subject of female guides in "Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money". Miss Ouyang Feili and Miss Ning Xuan played the role of the guide, and their acting skills were really good.</p>
<h3>"New Year's Money" - A True Reflection of the Lives of Dance Hall Girls in Small Dance Halls</h3>
<p>Under the economic depression and commercial competition in the market, the methods of attracting dance customers in dance halls are becoming more and more strange, especially in small dance halls. In addition to reducing the number of tickets to more than a dozen for one yuan, without additional gifts, it is really miserable for ordinary dance girls to make a living under such circumstances.</p>
<p>In the blockbuster "New Year's Money", recently completed by Star Company, directed by Zhang Shichuan, assisted by Zheng Xiaoqiu and Hu Xinling, and starring more than 20 major stars such as Hu Rongrong, Li Minghui, and Xi Qiuxia, the dance girls in small dance halls are often subjected to the humiliation of dance customers, and there is a very profound description of it!</p>
<p>After a playboy takes a "New Year's money" with the word "happiness" from the hands of a worker, he walks into a small dance hall with a happy mood. The word "happiness" is written on the fighting mouth. 15 dances, nude performances, and mysterious gift advertisements are inside. Smoky, noisy, a playboy dances with an extremely ugly dance girl, constantly watching other dance girls, he finds that a beautiful dance girl is dancing with a dance customer, he drags the ugly dance girl to the front of the beautiful dance girl, pushes the ugly dance girl to the beautiful dance girl's opponent, pulls over the beautiful dance girl, the opponent takes a look at the playboy's appearance, has to endure, and then looks back at the ugly dance girl, then gives up dancing and leaves.</p>
<p>The playboy embraces the beautiful dance girl and dances wildly, with frivolous gestures. The beautiful dance girl is extremely painful. After dancing for a long time, the beautiful dance girl is exhausted and takes the opportunity to wipe her sweat. The playboy steps on her foot painfully. The beautiful dance girl asks the playboy to be careful, which provokes the playboy's anger. He slaps the dance girl, and knocks over the table. The dance hall manager hurriedly comes out to apologize and promises the playboy to immediately stop the beautiful dance girl's business. The beautiful dance girl sees that her business has been stopped and asks the playboy to calculate the dance tickets she just danced. The playboy takes out the "New Year's money" he took from the worker's hand from his pocket and throws it on the ground. The beautiful dance girl endures her anger and picks it up. The playboy grabs her again: "One yuan for fifteen dances, you only danced fourteen dances just now!" He embraces her again and dances frivolously.</p>
