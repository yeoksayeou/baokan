<h3>平郊發生戰事</h3>
<p>— 高</p>
<p>高自日軍以急遞挑釁形式惹起蘆溝橋事變以來。經六日之砲火交綏。血肉搏併。迄于今茲匪特雖覓消弭之朕兆。且有轉趨擴大之傾響。戰事延至平郊形勢日益緊張。東亞危局。殆如縣聲。朽索維縏。彈指可墜。吾人縱以酷愛和平著稱。在如斯重重陵逼之下。亦誠有難以自處者。此次啟釁經過離奇殊甚。試就已事。一予分析。則是非曲直。不辨自明。查現駐冀省之日軍人數。原已超過辛丑條约之規定。方其調駐之始。外間即多猜測。其後迭次舉行人規模之演習。隨在顯示其威脅恫嚇之作用。當地人士。久已側目。顧普通演習。雖不合法。猶祇限子日間。此次則特別演習夜戰。且在條约以外之地點舉行。其為預定計畫。藉故尋釁。雖三尺童子。亦能洞其梗概。釁端既開。烽火日亟。我方本其息事寗人之旨。在極度憤概之下。猶欲勉自抑制。不使事態擴大。幾經口頭约定。雙方撤兵而日人一再肯信橫施截擊。關外軍隊。復源源開入。大量軍火。携載與俱。並聞由其國內另調兩個師團前來。何所企圖。需此大軍。馬昭用心。路人可識。故以後變化無論至如何程度。而肇事責任。固明白應由日方負之也。</p>
<p>是非既明。且言利害。日人狙於已往意外之獲得。遂謂我國可以任情而狎侮。不悟今日情形。遠非昔比。政府既已一再申明外交之立塲。人民亦能振刷過去頹唐之精神。而全國一致對於國家觀念之認識。實有不堪再受侮辱之趨勢。且現代戰爭。决不限於相對兩國。誠有如讀賣新聞所云云者。而宋哲元所謂與亡之數。不易逆料。亦未嘗無得失之根據。日方對此亦能加以深切之體味否。或謂日方存意。原亦不在擴大。特藉嘗試之故智。以期不勞而坐獲。此其佔計。亦屬錯誤。須知我國退讓之限度。已至最後迫切之關頭。誓與蘆溝橋共存亡之表示。寗尚不足以見我將士守十之决心。而必欲多方壓迫。曲肆陵侮。危機一蹈。將有不堪設想者。兵為危象。弗戢自焚。美報玩火之論。可謂罕譬而喻。日人果猶有一絲顧全東亞大局之誠意者。則縣崖勒馬。應知及時。瓶疊之恥。固不僅吾人抱此殷憂也已。</p>

<p>黃先生是位深思遠慮的政治家、他的愛國心比常人熱烈、他的謀國比常人深遠、他認識事實、不唱浮囂的高調、而力求以自己的力量來戰勝困難、這是黃先生平生一貫的精神、他建設大上海的目的、更給了我們具體的證明、我們歌頌黃先生的大上海計劃、不應忘了他的用意和精神、至於黃先生所創立的市政府組織中、特別值得我們提及的、是酌採美國經理制精神、實行分局治事、分局治事、目下已推行全國、大家認為足以選拔專才、充分給他以施政的使利、而無與於市長的進退、但當時却未必能得到一般人的瞭解、與論方面、往往以為規模過大、經費過鉅、而表示責望、但膺白先生却力排衆議、毅然實行、他和第二任市長張伯璇先生的談話中、會經說過、“吾人立法施政、始盡智慮以决之、繼禀勇氣以赴之、終持毅力以成之、義所當為、浮言奚恤、日後自有事實為其答案也、”是的、現在已經有良好事實作為答案了、</p>
<p>關於膺白先生當時用人無私和識拔眞才的精神、我們最好客觀地引證親歷其事者的叙述來代替說明、黃伯樵先生云、“上海特別市各局皆係新創、所屬職員自秘書科長以下數百人、市長未嘗推薦一人、一任各局長全權選拔、余之公用局如此、其他各局亦如此、局長中從先生多年者如此、與先生初識者亦如此、”潘公展先生於“想到初次會見的膺白先生”一文中云、“我受了他的感動、竟不自覺的吿起奮勇來說、“我願意為先生草擬一個農工商局的組織大綱、同時寫一篇處理勞工行政的計劃、作為對於先生草創我國第一個特別市的些貢獻、”他也笑着鼓動我起草、我就辭別了他、同來動筆以踐此约、却不料膺白先生後來奉命任市長的一天、竟責成我這個沒有行政經騐、同時與他向無深交的人來擔任農工商局的事務、……”</p>
<p>末了讓我們再引沈昌先生的話、證明膺白先生當時治事的辛勤和精密、沈先生說、“余識先生八年、……而為僚屬者、實僅上海市政府、為時不足三月、先生政事忙、無片𣌿之暇、余又在下僚、然於余擬公牘、必躬自批閱、甚至摘由繕寫一字之誤、亦為標出、又吿余、“辦一案必先熟看舊卷、明其本末、擬一稿必首尾完善、條貫淸晰、”……</p>
<p>以上簡略地叙述了黃膺白先生為上海市長時創制和施政、不過略擧數事、疏漏很多、但即此已值得我們的紀念和飲佩了、（上面引據的各家言論、除了黃先生自己的演說詞外、均採自“黃膺白先生故舊感憶錄、”（完）</p>

<h3>有血氣的國人聽者</h3>
<p>人之所以為人，因為他有血氣的緣故，沒有了血氣，就等於行尸走肉，不能稱之為人。</p>
<p>我要問問我自己，我更要問問國人，我們可有血氣麼？我們可能算是人麼？人家折斷了我們的一條腿，我們熬着痛，撑一根拐杖算了；人家扭傷了我們的一條臂，我們捱着苦，絡一根繃帶算了。我們始終是忍氣吞聲，一步步的讓人，簡直那裹還有血氣，那裹算是人！</p>
<p>於是人家又來了，索性伸着鐵箝般的手指，來又我們的喉嚨，要我們的命了。我們已到了生死關頭，實在讓無可讓，忍無可忍了。</p>
<p>有血氣的國人聽者，盧溝橋不但是二十九軍一部份將士的墳墓，也是我們中華民國全民族的墳墓，我們要以鐵和血來保住盧溝橋，以鐵和血來保住全中國。</p>

<h3>革命先進沈醒初</h3>
<p>— 陳劍霞</p>
<p>自中山先生創立興中會以後，當時革命同志，暗中宣傳，多方聯絡。我鄕雖蕞爾小邑，而明達之士，早有參加活動者，我師沈醒初先生，尤為傑出。其灌輸革命思想，遠在光緒季年。時淸廷初擬廢除科擧，先生雖為博士弟子，顧首先興辦學堂，提倡新學。其腦後之髮辮，早付并州一剪。是時社會風氣，尚極蔽塞，物議訕笑，先生弗顧也。每當學校擧行集會，先生利用時機，登台演說，鼓吹其革命宗旨，以推翻淸室為己任，往往口若懸河，亳不顧忌，聽者為之動容。先生跛一足，而健步如飛，奔波於滬杭一帶，遍交當地同志，以貫澈其平素主張。一時相與往還者，有葉楚傖•陳陶遺•褚輔成諸氏，皆當時同盟中堅。而先生之辯才文彩，尤為儕輩所推許。先生別號守瓶，或問其取義，答曰：“君豈不知我為蹺脚乎？蹺脚者步履顚頓，穩瓶難持，我願堅守我瓶，使之顚撲不破耳！”聞者無不捧腹。其風趣有如是者。情後此督理鄕政，偶因細故，被愚民所銜，旣搗其所辦之學校，復將先生圍攻，慘殺於縣衙之前。淸時法制，凡羣情殺戮者，罪得末减。故兇手諸人，直至鼎革後始克抵償。而先生竟不及見光復之實現，當亦含恨於九泉也！現在國府諸公中，想不乏先生舊交，讀此文，不知猶能追溯其平生，而證我言之不虛乎！</p>
<h3>張之江起早</h3>
<p>— 雪文</p>
<p>張之江氏，現在在南京，除了擔任中央國術館的館長以外，另外還辦了一所國體專校，自任校長。該校在紫金山下，環境淸幽，風景絕佳，校舍的建築設備，亦頗稱“棒”，而且還在謀擴展中。</p>
<p>張氏雖然是一位老前輩了，但身體的强壯，表神的飽滿，却還不輸於年輕力壯的小伙子。只要看他講演時候，那種嘹亮的嗓門，指手晝脚生龍活虎的姿態，直不能不呌人佩服他“老當益壯”的精神哩。</p>
<p>聽過他講演的人，沒有不笑的。語調老是那末幽默，而且伸拳曲掌的，有人說：“張先生在講演時也在打拳哩”！</p>
<p>他每天起得很早，據說四點來鐘就起來，在外面練拳。有時學生還沒有起牀，他已坐着汽車來梭了。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十五回（消息問城南芸窗說夢風流辭席上綺巷回車）</p>
<p>章老太道：作母親的人，有不疼愛自己兒子的嗎？而况我的情境，和一般人又大不相同呢。友梅點點頭道：姑母說的很有道理。不過表兄這樣很不自在的樣子，總不能讓他這樣延長下去吧？章老太道：那是的，我也打算今天他醒來的時候，要問他一個詳細的。劉媽，你去看看少爺起來了沒有？就說有客來了。友梅站起來，向章老太同搖着兩雙手，微笑道：表兄如是酒醉還沒醒過來，就讓他再休息休息罷。章老太笑道：李小姐，你很聰明，怕我在你當面敎訓他，他太難為情。當然，我也要顧全他一點面子，不會在客面前說他的。可惜他沒有像你這樣的老朋友，常在一處。友梅把眼皮低下了，望了老太太脚下的銅火爐，將上牙咬了下嘴唇皮，沉思了一會子。然後笑道：表兄也很有幾位文字上的知己朋友吧？章老太倒沒有介意他的熊度，答道：不會有的。假如有的，他這樣不如意的事，一定會告訴那知己朋友，請他設法的。你不要以為他不願意吿訴母親的事，就不願吿訴朋友，那可是兩年事。吿訴了我，不但和他想不了分憂解愁的法子，也許跟着他一塊兒發愁起來。至於知己朋友，那可不然。想不了主意，也不會為了朋友着很大的急。友梅將放在茶椅上的一蓋碗泡茶，雙手捧着，端起來喝了一口。緩緩的放了下來，微笑道：也許他的知己朋友，一樣的想不出主意來。章老太道：那自然，他不是呆子，未見得他沒有辦法的事，別人就有辦法。只是作好朋友的人，看到他這種放浪的樣子，一定是要勸勸的，他現在並沒有人勸勸他，可是他並沒有好朋友了。友梅點點頭道：是，照說，表兄這樣放浪起來……呵！我也是瞎說。其實我並沒有看到他做什麼了不得的事，我怎麼也說他放浪？喝兩杯酒喝醉了，這也是文人的常事。章老太聽了他這話，也是微微的笑着：似乎老人家臨時發現了什麼，要審査一樣，在友梅全身上下，都打量了一遍。友梅見他老人家無端的向自己打量起來，這倒不解他所觀察之由，把頭低了下去，微微的笑着，却有兩塊桃花色的紅暈飛上了臉腮。自己望了脚底下，把脚尖在地面上畫着。（一九六）</p>
<h3>民族英雄“三江好”</h3>
<p>— 則誠</p>
<p>有好些人因為報紙的宣傳出了名，使大家認識了。但也有因為不善宣傳而埋沒了的英雄。這裹我願意價紹一位不很有名的民族英維“三江好”，本名是羅明星。</p>
<p>羅是山東范縣人，故鄕距梁山近，所謂燕趙多慷概悲歌之士，他大概就受了這個秉賦羅？他十四五歲時因為故鄕遭了歉歲，便出關謀生，繼而投到張作相的部隊裹去當兵，民國十八年他已經是一個營長了。“九一八”事變後，稍徵有血氣的人都忍受不了鐵蹄的踐踏，而起來呼號，反抗。羅便領了他的部隊，揭起義旗幹上了。不久就有很多的人響應他。這樣當然會招致漢奸和敵人的憤嫉，於是調集大兵來剿伐他。他的抵抗力可眞成，據說他前後身經五十餘戰，固然有時候失利，但部民弄得他們—敵人及漢奸軍隊疲於應付。</p>
<p>去年他受了重傷，轉道回國來了，一方面為了治療便利，順便也看看國內的情形，那時我正在山東一家報館當編輯，因為朋友的介紹認識了這位民族英雄。明快的談吐，健偉的體格，眞呌你不由得喊一聲：“名不虛傳！”後來我們成了很要好的朋友。有一次他哭着對我說：“×先生：我進關差不多快一年了：雖然我無時不惦念着關外的弟兄，但是我沒有辦法啊。在南京，在北平我會過許多軍政長官，我也會到上海會過許多抗×前輩李杜，王德林，但是……但是……”羅哭不成聲。</p>
<p>有一次他忽的很高興的跑到我家裹吿訴我：“五天後我將到西安去了，會會張少帥，𤩓有東北軍的幾個朋友，大槪半月可以回來，但我將不來這裹，或者直接出關去了，我現在就算來辭行，我希望不久我們在收復了的失地裹相會。”表聽了這話悲戚，但也高興。</p>
<p>可是事不如意十常八九，說話的第三天，西安事變的消息傳到了山東。羅拿着一大捲報紙找到我家裹劈頭就說：“想不到張少帥會鬧這麼一下子，一切都完了！我請你起草打一個電報給張，萬一生點效力也未可知……”我也同樣的憤慨，於是我很快的拿起筆來寫，這時問他怎麼說呢？他很乾脆的回答：“你說張少帥：你已經把關東三千萬人擲到火裹了，你還忍得把全國四萬萬人都擲到火裹麼？”這是多麼有力的口氣，所以我便照這意思擬出稿來拍發了。</p>
<p>不久我便離開了山東，二個星期以前又接到羅從東北寄來的信，才曉得他又出關了，在我的心裹永永不會忘掉這個人，是的，這才是值得佩服的民族英雄，這才是一條站得起來的漢子呢！</p>
<h3>林則徐的放足論</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>日前因事隨友往訪其戚閔君，時閔君方曝書於庭，其中有裝池頗為精緻的二冊，題簽“來鴻集”，却是他的三四代先人，所遺的東札。閔君世代書香，而他的祖會遠三世，都以遊幕為業的，所以在他的“來鴻集”中，所蓄的淸代名人的手墨，幾佔着十之三四。</p>
<p>據我友言，六七年前，會獲一窺其中的梗概。其中一函，是林則徐氏，致閔君的外祖的。據說閔君的外祖，在鴉片之戰時，適遊幕於林氏處，頗為林氏所器重。嗣林氏被謪，遂去而之他。該函，是鴉片戰役之後，林氏於謪居生活中，致其外祖，暢論着婦女應放足。全函長凡五千餘字，是寫在黃糙之至的桑皮紙上的，寫的是一手帶草的歐字，但帶有三分柳字的骨幹。</p>
<p>雖然當時我友，未能窺得其全豹，但對於林氏的放足論，已竊記其一二。首段所述的，是須有天足之母，乃能有魁偉之子。雖未顯明地說淸之亡明，是因滿人不緾足，乃有壯健之戰士，仩字裹行間，此意已躍然於紙背。嗣乃述及於鴉片之戰中，江浙守士之怯於死戰，而歸咎於守將之母之小足，謂為一步三搖之母，所生之子，怎可以當衛國干城之重任。緊接着的，是以倭寇為例，謂明代倭寇之不得內犯，是得力於各地農民的抗禦，而又說農民們是少有由纖足的母觀們所生的，所以是那麼的勇敢而不怕死。</p>
<p>這種言論，在今日看來，自然是覺得有些兒那個，然而在七八十年前，林公已見到緾足之風之宜革，其識見之卓越，也就大足令人驚佩了。</p>
<h3>林主席的儉樸生活</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>現在國府的要人當中，我們知道有二位是美髯公，一位上監察院長于右任，一位却是我們的國民政府主席林森了。因為林主席的年齡雖已到了古稀，可是他的精神却甚矍鑠。𡤕尺來長的銀髯映着半禿的額頂，更襯着他那溫和慈祥的態度，那麼飄飄然的，眞有些兒鶴髮童顏，神仙高人之概！</p>
<p>他原是福建的閩侯人，早年為了革命，一生追隨先總理奔走南北，自己的故鄕也很少機會回去。但南洋羣鳥他倒會到過幾趟，而在南洋的華僑，也對他的信仰很深。就是在六七年以前，被推選為繼任的國府主席時，他還正在南洋視察僑務呢。</p>
<p>然而他到了這樣的高年，還能夠保持他那樣壯健的體格，却完全由於他日常生活的有規律和有修養；自然，平時營養的豐富也是一大原因。譬如他每天要吃一杯童鷄汁，數十年如一日，從未間斷過，因為他時常說：童鷄汁的功效很大，一杯童鷄汁的效力至少要勝過普通補藥十帖。他也非常相信國藥，他說這是國粹，應該保護而改進之。當數年以前，中西醫藥界正在爭鬬風潮時，他和立法委員焦易堂便竭力維護國醫，而使國藥得以保存。</p>
<p>不論天時寒暖，他每天總是很早就起身的，他起身後喝過一杯童鷄汁，便出去散步，呼吸新鮮空氣。他不拘居家出外，都非常愛好樸素淸潔：有時他穿着一件布袍，套着一雙布鞋，悠閒地踱着方步。我相信，如果讓不認識他的人見了，一定不知道他竟是一位當今的堂堂國府主席，而以為他是一位古老的學究先生哩！</p>
<p>人家說他是一位平民化的主席，眞是一點也不過份，因為他不但衣服樸素，他的日常生活更是儉樸，他的言行，尤其值得我們崇仰。照理說，他是國府的最高元首，無論起居衣食都應該是很富麗的了，但是事實上他的生活却還夠不上一位什麼局長或什麼科長來得舒適。</p>
<p>林主席在上海也有一個私邸，就是在金神父路的一條衖裹，那是一所廣式三層樓房屋，每月租金只五六十塊錢：比之一般要人一個汽車間也要佔上三四分地面的，眞是有霄壞之別了。至於他南京的國府主席官邸，自然是例外。</p>
<p>在上海的時候，他有時偶然出門，自己沒有自備汽車，即是到遠處去訪友。或有事，也是在鄰近一家汽車行裹去呌出差汽車的。</p>
<p>他現在沒有妻子，兒子媳婦也不在身邊，上海這座公館裹，只有一對四十來歲的廚子夫婦在兼着守家的職務。</p>
<p>此外，主席也愛好古玩書畫，現在他公館裹，就藏着許多古書古董和其他骨董，他自己會向人說，他對於古董的鑑別本領很强，隨便漢書唐書，祇要一經他辯認，莫不眞偽立分。到了上海，他在閒着的時候，總喜歡一個人走到城隍廟裹去，到舊書攤上去揀點舊書，或在古玩舖裹去看看骨董，所以他差不多便成了城隍廟古玩舖中的老主顧。自然，大家都認得他是國府的主席，於是往往把價格抬得高些，但他還價的門檻也很不差。等到講好了價，看好了貨品，他就吩咐舖子中派人送去，自己却踱着九曲橋回家，待小夥計把貨送到了才給錢。</p>
<p>有時，他的衣服有點破壞了，便呌人修補好了再穿着：並且他還時常對一般年靑的人說：“我們的國家已經窮困到了這樣，只好大家節省一點來培養國力……”</p>
<p>如今，他出任國府主席已經是第三任了；幾次的被推選，他雖一再地竭力謙辭，然而各方都因為他年高望重，除了他以外、實在沒有比他再適宜的人才了，所以終於這一次還是他作了國民政府的主席。</p>

<h3>誓</h3>
<p>— 蕪村</p>
<p>做事要取信於人，最好自然是用事實來證明。但這樣就必須切實去做，費力得很。簡便的辦法是嗚誓，用幾句慷慨激昂，鮮血淋漓的誓詞，來表明自己的心跡。</p>
<p>村婦愛咒人，同時也善於自誓。為人爭論，倘有所解辯，便一手朝天，戟指而言曰：“天在頭上，這件事要是這樣，我一定要天誅地滅；要不然寃枉我的人也不得好死！”</p>
<p>可是彼蒼者天，於人何涉，它是永遠不管人間的是非的。誓嗚過了，事情也就完了。</p>
<p>聽的人也聽過就算了。他們永不會相信。</p>
<p>摩登男女談戀愛，在無人處擁抱接吻以後，說道：“愛人呀，我們要永遠相愛，直到海枯石爛，天崩地裂！”這呌做“信誓旦旦。”但海也不枯，石也未爛，興致過了，不妨大家走散，再找別的對象戀愛，起誓去。</p>
<p>曾經在一本什麽筆記上，大約是一位前清的遺老做的，裏邊有一篇，講的是這樣的一個故事：</p>
<p>據說有一位富家子弟，迷戀了一個妓女，少爺固然非她不娶，姑娘也非嫁給他就活不成了。少爺下了决心，回家去“交涉，”要求父親完成他們的婚事。臨走時彼此起了誓，女的並且要求留一種他的身上的信物，結果是他忍痛犧牲，鑿下了一粒牙齒。誰知回家以後，老太爺堅决不答應，說妓女不會有眞愛情，他不妨裝了窮相再去看看她對他的熊度。於是少爺遵命，三月不薙，十月不滌，弄得樣子狼狽不堪以後，去看他的情婦。結果，那妓女果然不理他了。少爺一下子氣得發抖，要討還他親手鑿下的牙齒。好，要還就還，妓女拿出來了，牙齒有一盒子之多，說道：“那一粒是你的，你自己去找吧。”</p>
<p>這文章，大抵是勸人不要和妓女講愛情，或者竟勸人不要逛窰子的。但我們由此可以知道，世間居然還有以鳴誓為職業的人。</p>
<p>近幾年來，做人的經騐一多，對於那些激昂慷慨的誓詞的敬意就更少。什麽“誓死抗敵，”什麽“誓不作城下之盟，”眞說得民衆遍體清凉，覺得我們的民族就要有救。不料轉瞬之間，嗚誓者又笑嘻嘻的喝着香檳，在跟人家簽訂什麽什麽的“恊定”了。</p>
<p>蘆溝橋事件爆發以後，士氣激昂，我們又聽到了“誓不……”什麽的呼聲。可是，眞掃興，我想起了歷次聽誓的經騐。</p>
<p>但願咒語有靈，華北抗敵的將士，不會再在“親善外交”的影響下白費了他們誓詞吧。阿彌陀佛！</p>
<h3>劉老頭故事</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>正是深秋的天，棉絮的雲塊流遍空朗的天野，樹葉枯黃了，捲着北地的風沙呼嘯着，打在別人的紙窗上。一到這種時候，劉老頭就開始走上悲戚的歲月。</p>
<p>他的年紀在六十開外了，一臉花白鬍子，飄飄地，頭頂數不出有百十根髪絲。他的腿有點殘缺，一根柱杖成了經常的伴旅，但假使有孩子們跌倒他的跟前，就會不顧殘缺的去抱起來。他不會發急，不懂事的孩子不管這些，碰到高興，隨手在他的禿頭上敲上兩下，有時敲得重了，他就用左手緊遮了頭，右手扶了那根柱杖顚獗着走開。他也歡喜喝兩盅，但由喝酒可以看出歲月交替的記號，春秋天氣，每飯兩盅，夏天則改在早晚，像這秋暮時分，整瓶的燒酒成了無上的恩物了。</p>
<p>他在這會館里當長班，（卽門房）一紮脚就是二十多年，那時他年靑，有熱烈的心情，路見不平，就能“㧞刀相助”的。在當時，科舉還沒有廢除，會館是專為投考的同鄉老爺們設備的，里面不准往女人，許多外路的光棍子苦悶得喞哇亂呌，一有閑空，就把話語集中到女人的堆里，並不因自己的身份而有所迴避。可是現在呢？會館里住的滿是些家眷，房子都歪七拗八的不成個樣子，沒有公款，誰肯挖腰包來幹。</p>
<p>說起這個會館却相當不小，兩扇漆黑的大門立着一雙石獅子，劉老頭住的門房是一連兩大間，往後是五進大院落，從正廳的廳堂分做兩個支岔，往西的是後跨院，那里有小偏門通到胡同里，往南的却是條通道，直通到“更樓”。通道當中還有個廁所，里面的兩顆大槐樹緊蓋了大廳的房脊，如凉棚一樣，更樓高過大廳有一倍多，站在樓上能够俯覧整個的會館。在從前，據說樓上還設有鏢師以防不測，現在，碉堡樣的更樓雖已破敗不堪，鏢師雖已不復存在，而每夜打更的責任，在老劉的身上已經二十多年了。</p>
<p>更樓外是荒僻的黑窰廠，一到天黑就斷絕了人跡，冷天更凄凉得令人可怕。街燈吊在很遠的地方，燈火發綠，白天的警察早已撤了崗位，偶爾的有呌賣“炸豆麪丸子”的聲浪尖長的掠過天空，可以呌你打抖，可以讓你意會到隨在聲浪後面的有怎樣一個可怕的塲面。更樓的底層有個小門，封鎖得很長久了，說是那里面有多少不能“及第”的讀書人自尋短見，都被整個的投埋進去，以此，會館才永遠的享不到太平。</p>
<p>沒事的時候，老劉也歡喜和我們瞎談，他說由於多年的經歷，曾聽見過不少的鬼聲，但從沒有人看見過鬼到底是什麽模樣，如果眞遇到了性命一定不保險，老劉就怕這個，但他不能不做工，才用燒酒澆起滿肚子的火燄，喝得眼珠子發紅，這樣，冒了夜風，把一股酒氣來衝散可詛咒的鬼怪。</p>
<p>住在館里的大半都是些本分人家，不過問旁人的閑事，也不讓人家的風濤吹到自己的頭上。可是這幾天變了，掌館的張老爺不知怎麽會不見兩床厚毛氈，簡直是霹靂，鬧翻所有的人家。張老爺罵過車夫，罵過老媽子，也罵過老劉，說他看門不小心，放了偷兒進館，從此，大門提旱關閉以備不虞。</p>
<p>四五天匆忙的過去了。這天夜晚，月色正明，澄清得如鏡子。一更過去了，風吹得窗紙在響，頂棚也一陣呼拉呼拉的動，坑磚的火燒得像春天。他把二更的酒灌下肚子，揑了兩塊羊頭肉塞在嘴里，沿了熟悉的路走進往南的通道，然而說不出緣故，他的心在跳，彷彿失去自主。登上更樓，把梆子敲了幾下，慌忙的再走下來，由着月色，他看見大廳里有兩個灰白的東西在動，在動，似乎預備向他直撲。大喊一聲，一個斛斗滾到地上。</p>
<p>同住的人由四面圍抄過來，狂喊着。有的還拿了傢伙。劉老頭的臉轉成鐵靑，牙磨擦得很響，手指着大廳。於是這些人又呼嚒着衝過去，打開廳門，結果捉着兩個人，一個是張老爺的車夫，一個是後跨院的年輕老媽子，那失去了的兩床厚毛氈，却墊在他們的身下。</p>
<p>最後，劉老頭把這多年的職務，安祥的遺留下來，轉讓給一個生手。</p>
<h3>何處去</h3>
<p>— 石竹</p>
<p>他用紙頭揩了揩當桌子用的大圓凳，再拿好了碗筷，用擱在鼻梁上的老花眼鏡向扶梯下望了望，老婆還沒有來哩，他背起手沉重的在地板上踱着。</p>
<p>整天痴在這個舊亭子間的五歲兒子，大概是嗅到鍋裏的飯香了：</p>
<p>“爸爸，肚子痛吶。”</p>
<p>“這是餓痛了的。今天有飯，等你姆媽下工來一道吃。不要哭。”</p>
<p>他雖呌兒子不要哭，可是看見兒子餓得跟乾蝦蟆似的，禁不住鼻子酸了。自己受了三年的牢獄生活，雖然未死，雙眼已成半瞎了，自己還不過二十八………死了倒算了，可是現在還得來受活罪………出反省院二年了，舊友懷疑，新友又……反是全靠老婆在鬼子紗廠里做工賺苦錢來生活，兒子以後一定餓不下去了，但這小小的生命就……眞太慘</p>
<h3>戰</h3>
<p>阿比西尼亞被意大利軍隊用毒瓦斯宣揚“文明”之後，卽是蘇俄攝製的“阿比西尼亞”紀錄影片也在上海被意大利水兵用木棍，硫水，又“文明”了一次，到今天（十三日）却讀到了羅馬敎皇的廣播演講，主旨為勸人“祈禱和平，”略謂“世界擾攘，人民顚沛，今日之痛苦未除，明日之惶恐已至，吾人其為此世界，為此人民，籲禱上帝賜以和平”云。</p>
<p>世界之所以擾攘，人民之所以顚沛，我們應該籲請羅馬敎皇加以詳𧗊的說明的，—誰不願天下太平，安居樂業呢？</p>
<p>但是阿比西尼亞的人民死傷載道，為王的也出奔他鄉，其誰之咎歟？羅馬敎皇到這時候來“祈禱和平，”總覺太遲了！</p>
<p>世界旣已擾攘了，人民也早受眞沛了，如“增兵”之後，要談“親善，”卽使是“野蠻民族”也懂得生存之道，“祈禱和平”的夢話是祇有“文明人”才想得出來的。</p>
<p>要生存，惟有挺戰！予打擊者以打擊！</p>
<p>— （戰士）</p>

<p>啦！他不能想，搖了搖頭，將眼鏡上的淚痕抹去，勉强的靠着窗口來看一抹如瀉的天空，軟軟的日光正融解在路上行人的笑臉上。他苦着臉再回頭來無意識地望這久已窳敗了的房子，又記起早晨那個抽大烟的女二房東已經辭了他，因為有二個月沒有付房租。他無法地歎口氣撇過頭來再不想看什麼。可是昏黃的視綫又投到用本板擱的牀上，而這牀上的棉絮里還睡着一個二個月的小兒子哩；他好像是忽然知道他還有一個兒子似的，悽然地“哦”了一聲，木頭似的坐倒在木凳上。大兒子蹲在那里無神地望着他。</p>
<p>老婆低着頭來了，她今天臉色更蒼白，交織着憤怒與憂愁，搖㨪着身體倒在牀上喘氣。小孩子被驚醒了，乾啞的嘶啼着，她只得勉强抱起來喂奶，粗糙的手在孩子身上顫抖。</p>
<p>他趕快盛了飯，又把昨天剩下的半塊霉豆腐端出來。大孩子這才靜靜的爬上凳來吃飯。</p>
<p>“秋萍，你還是和往回一樣一面喂奶一面吃飯吧，不是又要來不及上工。扣工錢——你今天像生病哩！”</p>
<p>“上工？唉，全體罷工了。”</p>
<p>他全身麻木了，心在撲撲的亂跳。夫妻兩人都苦痛地互視着。說不出一句話。終於，終於，老婆深陷的眼眶中晶瑩着兩顆淚珠。</p>
<p>“工人流盡汗血，替鬼子一天到晚搖紗，搖紗，可是只給你三四毛錢，這應該罷工的。這次為了大家，我其實也是鼓動者——可是，為自己想一想，我們已經窮得要死了，怎麽能够沒有工做呢！”</p>
<p>那勇敢的瘦婦人，深深地深深地掛下兩條淚流，點滴在懷中毛茸茸的孩子的臉上。</p>
<p>他的喉頭哽住了，說不出一句話。碗里的黃米飯漸漸冷却了，從小孩的尿布上飛了幾隻蒼蠅棲息在上面。他下意識地用手揮了揮；偶然看見兒子正在埋着頭沒命的吃着飯。是的，有十來天沒吃過飯呢，他望着兒子出神。兒子從灰色的臉上劃出兩道跟老人的皺皮似的笑紋：</p>
<p>“爸爸，今天寫意吶！”</p>
<p>他身上一陣冷，忽然跑過去抱着兒子的臉亂吻，半響才迸一句：“孩子，你眞苦啦！”</p>
<p>房里暫時死寂了，馬路上傳來了幾聲汽車的嗚呌，可是却聽不到每天所熟悉的工廠汽笛的長號。</p>
<p>“現在怎麽辦呢？俠夫！”她黯然地扶起頭望着他。</p>
<p>他疲乏極了，但是很緊緊的握着她的手：</p>
<p>“房東今天退了我們的房子了。我還有什麽說呢？你眞太可憐了。——昨天老黃對我說，有一個公司要找一個抄寫員，他問我去不，我眼睛都要瞎了，還能够去麽，我沒有答應他。現在我想我只有去了。”他頓了頓，把那件長衣披上了：</p>
<p>“我就去找老黃去。還不知道遲了不遲哩。”</p>
<p>老婆哭起來了。她哽咽着說：</p>
<p>“你吃了飯再去……”</p>

<h3>駕車經騐談</h3>
<p>— 為元</p>
<p>㊀下山　當駛下一個傾斜度大而路面又畸嶇的山坡。不可放着膽應用下齒輪。想從發動機上得着額外帶緩的效能。新式的制動器對於下坡的危險上有極大的帮助。</p>
<p>㊁握牢　在發烈風的時候。須把轉向輪揑牢。尤其是在旁邊有時有房屋或樹木而忽然沒有的路上。應付事情。切不可馬虎。當你正追前別的車輛時候。因為一陣狂風會把前面的車輛改變趨向。不期然地惹起了禍事。</p>
<p>㊂敏捷　在狹窄地方駕車。把轉向輪施用得愈敏捷愈好。最好使這種動作成為一種習慣。尤其是對於許多新式的汽車。他們的車輪動向次數比較多。許多駕駛者因了轉向太慢而浪費了許多寶貴的光陰和地位。</p>
<p>㊃勿拂塵　人們往往用件乾的拂塵物。以清潔車上的塵埃。這樣容易損傷漆面。最好用水以清潔車身。可免意外的損失。</p>
<p>㊄汽油消耗　除非經過很遠的路程。汽車消耗量的試騐。往往會使我們誤會的。路面的情形。平均速度。以及氣候等對於試驗。結果都有關係。如果我們要得到正確的數字。不能信靠汽油錶的紀錄。甚至汽油唧筒有時也是錯誤的。所以汽油最好用正確的量油器。從油箱裏量出來。才算可靠。</p>
<p>㊅輕便轉向　前輪胎的壓力比尋常的多二磅。非但對輪胎沒有傷害。而且可以使重的轉向變成比較的輕便。</p>
<p>㊆霧影　在霧夜跟隨別的車輛的時候。把我們自己的頭燈最好關了。否則那車輛的前面會橫着個黑影。而使情况會比以先加倍的危險。</p>
<p>㊇利用機會　不要使我們自己着急。如果急於要達到目的地的時候。不要在沒有機會的地方製造機會。只可利用現成的機會。冒險是躭誤的一大原因。</p>
<p>㊈先明白路由　仔細地看熟了地圖。如果我們要到生疏的地方去。先看清了路由而後依着這路由駛去。中途遲疑多耗時間。而且遲疑的人往往會迷路。</p>
<p>㊉緩和制動緩　和制動的技術只須常常練習就很容易學到。這樣。汽車便能安全地駕駛着在光滑的路而上。和急用踏板的方法當然不可同日而語。可是這須注意踏板所用到的地步。完全的成功還得看制動機是否能輕便地運用着。因了這點。如果鼓形輪已經刮傷。應當把他取出矯正。已壞的面料應當換新。</p>
<p>㊉㊀輪胎過大　如果我們决計要改裝個過大的車胎套。我們必須請敎於車胎製造商。他們具有裝置車胎的專家知識而生活的。所以我們能信靠他們知道各種隱伏着的困難。除了那過大的輪胎是否適當地裝置在車輪胎環的問題之外。那輪胎還須經過額外的清除。因為增加了一些重量。有時會使前輪搖擺。</p>
<p>㊉㊁穩停　當換裝車輪的時候。如果車身沒有裝着永久抬重機。我們必須穩妥地以輕便抬重機抬起了車軸離了路而。再應用手板制動機。使車身不致轉動。用以放鬆螺梢的力量是很大的。如果車身不會制動妥善和穩固地抬起。抽是容易轉動的。</p>
<p>㊉㊂氣迷車窗　前窗的裏面將為氣霧迷蔽的時候。把車窗或通氣器稍微開一些。可使車內空氣氣轉動一下。車用發熱器的一個特點。就是使車內不致氣迷。</p>
<p>㊉㊃簡易潔凈　一個車身如灰色的。淡的除外）須要洗凈的次數比深黑色的少。質言的。深黑色的車身須常加洗凈。</p>
<p>㊉㊄駕車舒適　坐在大型車身內。速率雖然緩慢。而在崎嶇的路上。其速率和舒適總可超過小型的車身。</p>
<p>㊉㊅無蓋廚　行李廚外而沒有蓋而只能由後坐褥放入取出的。不如外而加蓋的來得便利。除非不是常用的。牠會使我們感到意外的麻煩。</p>
<p>㊉㊆唧筒潤滑　水唧筒總應用高度融點催滑油脂來潤滑。因為這種油脂不易與水混化。次等的潤機油脂。非但不能成為潤滑物。而且也許不會到散熱系統裏去。</p>
<h3>嚴重性的汽車肇禍問題（下）</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>敎育是防止汽車肇禍的積極方法，近來各公團對於這件事，無有不努力的，而且他們所敎育的，不但限於小孩，就是成人也包括在內，在最近十四年來，因為敎育的成功，已經减少了五分之一，美國汽車會與學校當局及家長敎員團體等，在學校裏努力進行安全運動，目下美國汽車會的敎材，訓練青年汽車駕駛人的，已經在紐约•梅恩•本雪文尼亞•及阿勃麥等的二•五○○新高級學校中，此外該會又在社會中組織三，○○○宣傳隊，專門宣傳安全運動，這樣在七，○○○，○○○名學生中，不啻有了許多安全的基本知識了。</p>
<p>許多市政當局為幫助汽車駕駛者，不致常常違章起見，當他們發生違章事件後，就把他們送到駕駛學校去，使他們養成良好的駕駛習慣，支加哥現已造有專為駕駛人練習用的塲所，各地接踵而起的也不在少數，所有駕駛功課都由專家主持之，各機關又常常標貼傅單圖片標語等，使駕駛者有所警惕。</p>
<p>科學家也發明了許多儀器和工具。作種種測騐。使駕駛人所有的毛病習慣等。都能很正確的表示出來。從此設法改善。便不致茫無頭緒了。對於駕駛與飲酒的影響。和速度危等等的連帶關係。都分析得很明白。怎樣避免炭氣的中毒也在研究之中。除了車廠外。車胎廠。油廠等也都參加安全運動的工作。哈佛大學西北大學的交通研究等科都是有稗實益而很著名的。</p>
<h3>一九三七年是中價汽車活躍的年頭</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>一九三七年度在美國的汽車界看來。已一致的承認是一個中價汽車最活躍的年頭。的確。事實告訴我們。不景氣已經是過去了。所有的實業。已十九踏上了復興的途徑。汽車業當然也不致例外。而且比較上更是來得有一種蓬勃的氣象。有很多事件。足以象徵在一九三七年度。汽車的銷數將繼續增加。而數字方面。更將超過一九三六年度。我們知道統計表上的曲線。一九三六年度。美國各廠所銷去的汽車。比一九三五年度增加了百分之二六。國民收入的普遍增加。包裝方法的改進。一切都足使一九三七年度的車主想購買一輛新車。而各廠的新車。一經放進了樣子間內。顧客就紛至沓來。這些事實。當然可使我們確信一九三七年的汽車銷數。又要比一九三六年度增加不少。就目前的情形說來。汽車界方面作計到本年度的銷數。至少要比去年增加百分之十。而過分樂觀的人。更以為將不上百分之十。結果使所有的車廠自本年度開始而後。都在積極的撕充營業。購置機件。力使可增加幾百萬車輛的產量。因為有許多定單。在年底以前。早已寄至各廠了。每一輛新車製成之後。立刻就可以銷去。這種情形。的確已好多年不見了。</p>
<p>美國的人民收入的加多。不但使他們想購買汽車。而且更使他們想買比較良好而舒適的汽車。所以購買新車的時候。售價方面。就是高些。倒也滿不在乎•一九三六年的數字。債價在美金七百元以上的汽車。比一九三五年度增加百分之四二。但總數祇增加百分之二六。自八百五十元至一千二百元的車輛。一九三六年度銷數竟比一九三五年度增加了百分之九五。自一千二百元到二千元的增加百分之六三。至於最低價的汽車。祇增加一八•三。這種傾向。為了國民購買力的增加。一九三七年度將繼續下去。的確。國民的收入和汽車事業很有關係的。我們回想起來。一九二八——二九這一個年度。全個美國。國民的總收入是八百萬萬元。內中百分之四•一耗費在汽車上面。一九三二年收入低落到四百萬萬元。那一年消耗在汽車上面的祇有百分之二•四。然而一九三二年之後。汽車界方面就發生了一個新的傾向。便是新車的製造。力主提高物質。减低車價。平均一輛汽車的成本。自全盛時代的八百九十五元低减到一九三五年度的六百九十元。這種向下的傾向。可使美國人民目前五十萬萬的收入。購買汽車的力量。足抵以前一百萬萬元的收入。一九三五年度國民的總收是五百六十萬萬元。一九三六年度六百萬萬元。照此推算。一九三七年度將有六百五十萬萬元。而汽車的銷數。可比上年度增加百分之三五。不過能否到達這個目標。我們還要期待事實來證明呢。</p>
<h3>最令一般人需要之斯可達汽車到申</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>斯可達Skoda汽水。為捷克期拉夫斯可達汽車廠出品。以消費奇省。效能特高。著稱於世。歐陸各處。早經風行。本埠福林汽車公司。頃以我國公路交通。日臻發達。效能特高之低價類汽車。當尤合於一般人之需要。爰特向斯可達廠接洽承銷。茲者新車第一批業於日前運抵此間。其概况如何。當為汽車界所欲知者。爰特撮要述之如次。</p>
<p>斯可達汽車之引擎。採用橡皮縣置。為水流保冷四汽缸四衝程式。並立式汽門。實馬力二十二匹。規定馬力十。四匹。汽缸夾層特佳。排汽量為六○。七立方寸。輕量合金精製之自動節熱活塞。力壓潤滑系。下引式化油機。配有自動火花提早管轄裝置之電池發火。電力始動機。運用靈便分接自然之單圓片克拉子。與後軸殻鑄成一體之變速機。三擋前進速度。二擋及三擋均為無聲諧動式。驅動軸無諭動靜胥極均衡。四輪獨立懸置。機械式四輪煞車。及獨立手煞車。轉向機構製絕佳。不受顚震。左御或右御式任便裝置。底盤架搆造特別堅强鞏固。流綫型鋼版車身。置身其中彌感安適。固不僅其外表秀美動人高尚壯觀已也。至其駕駛之不論路而若何。無往而不得心應手。操縱自如。尤不待言。而其安全可靠。亦遂因此而逈不可及。</p>

<p>美國　公路安全運動（Y.）標盡，意為“歡迎呀，愚笨人。試試看，早些死罷”。不啻為鹵莽駕駛人之當頭一棒也。</p>
<h3>汽車與農業影一個農民的自白</h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>在過去的幾年之中，在英美各國農村之中，也到處曝露出一種不景氣象的色彩，於是那些農民在行將破產的悲慘境地之下，很想借助於各種汽車之力，以减低農產品的成本，換一句話說，就是想把機器更廣遍的應用到農村上去，使所有的農作品得到機器的助力，而成本可以减低，汽車是一種運輸的利器，彼邦的農民，既渴望於獲得機器的助力，那麽對於汽車，當然也是希望其能够帮助於農業的，於是汽車界為應農民的需要起見，一種收稻的汽車，便開始問世了，農民的收集稻糧，如果用木製或鐵製的笨拙車輛，當然要比輕快便利的汽車慢得多，</p>
<p>最初，在英國，有十三輛收集稻榖的車輛，一面釘在底盤上，一面縛結在車身上，這集稻車離平地二尺高，前端向地下斜，成了一個巨大的叉形，這樣這集稻車前行之時，便自動的在田畝中收集稻榖，凡是車輛經過的地方，每一顆稻上的榖粒，都可被這汽車摘拮下來，斐爾德希亞地方，有一個農民，曾經寫了一篇文章，在奧斯汀雜誌上發表，他對我們這樣說：“我很想買一輛强有力的農用汽車，每小時的遠率在二十哩左右的，使得在集稻的時期，能得有很大的效果，這問題是很難的，為的是這車輛售價既須低廉，而且又要不會時常修理的，</p>
<p>“可是我後來聽得有一輛一九二一式奧斯汀二十號農用車要出售，離開我們三十里路，因此某一夭的午後，我便走去參觀，在我的心理，這車輛如果適用的話，那麽售價方面，就是超過我的限額，要是相差不遠，也得買它回來，作一度的嘗試，然而我所經過的是一個靜寂的鄉鎮，（未完）</p>

Only one-third of the troops have been transported so far, with the rest en route. Those entering through Gubeikou are part of the Kanto Army's Sato Division. Within three days, the Japanese army gathering in North China will have forces of three divisions and one brigade or more. (Urgent telegram, 2:00 AM, 14th)</p>
<h3>Focus of War Shifts from Lugou Bridge to Peiping Suburbs</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] From 11:00 AM on the 13th, fierce clashes occurred on the iron bridge outside Peiping's Yongdingmen and near Nanyuan. Japanese armored vehicles and tanks have all been transported to the front lines. Over a thousand troops from the Kanto Army were continuously transported from Tianjin to the suburbs of Peiping by heavy trucks starting at 5:00 AM on the 13th. Armored trains are being heated up and made ready to depart at the Tianjin Main Station. (Special dispatch, 3:00 PM, 13th)</p>
<p>[Peiping] The situation continues to worsen tonight. Japanese soldiers are present on both the east and west sides outside Yongdingmen. Japanese troops have not withdrawn from the Jiangjiafen-Gu Temple-Qingcha Village area. Residents have all fled. Tonight, the French and American military barracks have installed machine guns and cannons, and have increased their guard posts. As of tonight, the glimmer of hope for peace is truly hanging by a thread. Tonight is a critical juncture for peace or war, and is extremely important. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Peiping] Sixty to seventy armed Japanese soldiers in Fengtai, traveling in cars and carrying cannons and machine guns, attempted to enter Yongdingmen this afternoon. They were repelled by our troops at Dahongmen. Japanese bullets exploded, making a loud noise. The southern city of Peiping also heard artillery fire very clearly. Shops along Qianmen Street were temporarily closed, and the outer city gates were also closed. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Peiping] Three to four hundred Japanese soldiers are outside Guangqumen, attempting to enter the city but were refused. They have not withdrawn as of this morning and appear to be taking the opportunity to reconnoiter. Three to four hundred Japanese soldiers are also outside Qihuamen, and gunfire is heard from time to time. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Peiping] Several hundred Japanese soldiers, carrying seven tanks, came to Yongdingmen this afternoon to reconnoiter and clashed with our city defense troops.

The two armies are still in a standoff this afternoon. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] After 12:00 PM on the 13th, the fighting outside Peiping's Yongdingmen shifted to Guanyintang. The sound of artillery fire gradually intensified. The area west of Huangtupo-Fengtai is filled with Japanese troops. The Japanese have established a main camp in Fengtai and are now taking a south-west encircling posture around Peiping, amassing troops and gradually pressing in. The Pinghan, Pingsui, and Beining railways are all cut off. The focus of the war has now shifted from Lugou Bridge and Wanping to Peiping. The enemy seems to be focusing on the bases of our 29th Army in Nanyuan and Xiyuan. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Peiping] Chinese and Japanese troops engaged in a fierce battle for two hours today near the railway bridge half a mile south of Peiping outside Yongdingmen. This was the second serious clash in twelve hours. The first was at 10:00 PM last night, when the two armies clashed near the Caishen Temple two miles west of Peiping and at the racecourse two miles from the west city. Today's battle began at 11:00 AM this morning. About 500 Japanese soldiers, carrying four tanks and several armored vehicles, appeared on the railway between Peiping and Fengtai and made contact with Chinese troops from the Nanyuan airfield. The battle quickly approached Peiping, reaching the railway bridge outside Shuidimen. Thereupon, Chinese troops rushed from all sections of the city to reinforce the defending troops near the battle zone. The battle ended at 12:45 PM. During the clash, traffic south of the city was cut off, and residents were not allowed to go out. According to those who witnessed the battle on the city walls, the hand-to-hand combat was very fierce. Japanese troops who came from Gubeikou last night and attempted to enter Peiping City failed. It is reported that they retreated towards Fengtai due to the strength of the Chinese troops. Two heavy trucks carrying gasoline and bullets were destroyed and abandoned on the roadside. Two shells flew over the city wall and exploded. This morning, a small battle also occurred near the Chinese army barracks in Nanyuan because a team of Japanese soldiers went to reconnoiter. This afternoon, Japanese aircraft participated in the battle for the first time. Several aircraft bombed the Chinese troops in the Nanyuan area. According to foreigners living outside the city, last night's battle was also very intense. Both sides used artillery and machine guns to bombard each other, and used star shells to illuminate the battlefield. The battle ended at midnight when the Japanese troops retreated. The Japanese troops advanced along the Wanping-Peiping highway and the Pinghan railway line towards Lugou Bridge. According to villagers, when the battle began, Chinese soldiers captured a Japanese cannon. The Japanese troops coming from the west then engaged in battle with about a thousand Chinese soldiers. The Chinese soldiers dug trenches at the racecourse to hold their ground. This morning, a Reuters reporter visited the battlefield and learned that the Chinese troops withdrew from the racecourse at dawn. Many empty bullet boxes were left in the trenches. The Chinese troops are now guarding the Suiyuan Railway outside the west city. Today, a Reuters reporter visited Kato, the first secretary of the Japanese Embassy, who said that the hope for a peaceful resolution is not entirely lost. Kato visited Qin Dechun this afternoon to discuss ways to resolve the dispute. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Beining railway track outside Peiping's Yongdingmen was dismantled by us at noon on the 13th. A large number of Japanese troops are near the iron bridge. The telephone line between Nanyuan and Peiping was cut by Japanese troops, cutting off communication in that area. There is a Japanese artillery position at Dahongmen, which is constantly shelling our garrison camp in Nanyuan. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Peiping] Over six hundred Japanese troops, with more than forty armored vehicles, departed from Tongxian this morning and gathered at Chaoyang, Guang'an, and Yongding gates. The telephone line between Peiping and Nanyuan is disrupted. Trains on the Beining and Pinghan railways are not running. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Peiping] As of 8:00 PM on the 13th, the city is still quiet. Curfew hours remain the same. However, previously issued passes will be invalidated and reissued. The Peiping-Nanyuan telephone line was restored at 7:00 PM this afternoon. All trains to and from the east and west stations have been suspended. The Peiping-Shanghai train, which was originally scheduled to depart at 7:00 PM this afternoon and had already sold tickets, was temporarily suspended. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Peiping] After the sound of artillery fire outside Yongdingmen, the public panicked without knowing the details, causing shops from north of Yongdingmen Street to Zhushikou and Luomashi Street, Caishikou area west of Qianmen Street to close their doors. However, they completely reopened in about twenty minutes. A small number of shops on Qianmen Street also gradually reopened. Pedestrians remained calm as usual. The inner city gates such as Qianmen, Heping, and Xuanwu were still half-open. Electricity continued to be supplied as usual. However, the sandbags and other obstacles placed at key intersections on the streets, which had been removed yesterday, were now being piled up again. The Peiping-Nanyuan telephone line had not been restored as of 4:00 PM this afternoon. Tourists at the Shidimiao and Yuanmiao temple fairs on Guang'anmen Street were still crowded, showing no signs of alarm. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Peiping] The Japanese troops who were repelled by our army at Dahongmen this afternoon concentrated in the Haihuisi-Guanyintang area. Both sides suffered casualties in this battle. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At each station on the Beining Railway from Tianjin to Yuguan, a team of international police officers was dispatched by the Japanese side in the afternoon of the 13th, with four or five officers stationed at each station to assist the railway team in military transportation and to monitor our railway staff. Japanese soldiers have cut down sorghum and trees beside the Fenglin-Tingping railway and highway to facilitate combat. The Fengtai Fushun School has been occupied by Japanese soldiers as barracks, and classes have been suspended. On the evening of the 13th, one hundred and thirty empty Manchukuo Railway troop transport trains returned to Guanwai to pick up troops. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Peiping] This morning, Japanese soldiers at Shuangqiao, carrying six or seven tanks and more than twenty cannons, attempted to enter Chaoyangmen, but were refused by our army. They then divided and went to Nanyuan and Beiyuan. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Peiping] Official news: Zhang Lingyun and Sakurai, the supervisors dispatched by the Chinese and Japanese sides yesterday, returned to Peiping that evening after inspecting the front lines. According to reports, the Japanese troops have not withdrawn and are still in the Dajing Village-Wulidian area, numbering about 600. Since yesterday afternoon, Japanese troops have been arriving from Yuguan and continuing to concentrate in Tianjin and Fengtai, seemingly with the intention of expanding the incident. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Peiping] After 3:00 PM, I went to Yongdingmen, intending to go out of the city to investigate the truth of the clash, but was blocked by the guards and could not go. Soon, a wounded soldier was carried in from outside Yongdingmen, covered in injuries and in a very miserable condition. However, even in a coma, the wounded soldier showed great grief and indignation, and his spirit of loyalty and courage in defending the country was admirable. According to a soldier who accompanied the wounded soldier into the city, the Japanese troops carried four heavy trucks of bullets. Two of the trucks were hit and exploded by our army, and the remaining two trucks were captured by our army. The Japanese troops have now withdrawn, and our army is on high alert. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At Tianjin East Station, Japanese troops have dispatched teams to disperse to various locations, patrolling back and forth, and have requisitioned a room from the railway bureau to set up a Japanese military station command. The trains carrying Japanese soldiers to Tianjin are all from the South Manchuria Railway or the Guanwai puppet railway. They are currently parked in the freight yard of the East Station. On the 13th, due to the continuous stream of Japanese troop trains from Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and other places, many trains on the Beining Railway from the east could not depart on time. Train No. 4, the Peiping-Shenyang train, which was supposed to arrive in Tianjin at 3:30 PM, was still en route at 5:30 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Peiping] In the clash outside Yongdingmen between Chinese and Japanese troops at noon on the 13th, the Japanese troops were repelled by our army's valiant fighting by about 1:00 PM. When the clash occurred outside Yongdingmen, a part of the Japanese troops attempted to attack the 29th Army headquarters in Nanyuan, but were immediately dispersed by our army. At the same time, two Japanese trucks fully loaded with ammunition were parked in the Guanyintang-Zhelecai area. They were hit by our army and caught fire and exploded with a thunderous sound, and smoke and flames soared into the sky, which could be clearly seen from the Tianqiao area inside Yongdingmen. More than fifty Japanese soldiers were next to the trucks, eight or nine of whom were killed in the explosion, and the rest fled. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Personnel from Both Sides Are Still Negotiating for Peace</h3>
<p>[Peiping] Tonight, the tense situation in the suburbs of Peiping has eased slightly. Most of the Japanese troops at Lugou Bridge, Dajing Village, and Wulidian have withdrawn to the Fengtai-Xiguan Tou area east tonight, leaving only a small number of Japanese troops to defend the original cordon line. The focus of diplomacy has shifted to Tianjin. The peace issue is expected to be resolved tonight. (Urgent telegram, 2:00 AM, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Due to the Japanese side not withdrawing troops from the Lugou Bridge Incident and continuing to dispatch more troops, the resolution of the situation is becoming increasingly difficult. Chinese and Japanese parties are currently in Tianjin for negotiations. Chen Juesheng and Deng Zhexi have been meeting separately with various staff officers of the Japanese military in recent days. It is reported that the first step is to ease the current situation, and then discuss other matters. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Zhang Zizhong returned to Tianjin by car at 9:00 PM on the 13th. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] There is still a glimmer of hope for peace. Zhang Zizhong was originally scheduled to return to Tianjin by special train from Peiping at 6:00 PM on the 13th to discuss solutions at Song's summons. The departure was temporarily delayed because of the explosion of a Japanese ammunition truck in Anlelin Village outside Yongdingmen, which killed three soldiers and attracted a crowd of Japanese onlookers. The sandbags blocking the gap in Yongdingmen could not be removed in time. If there is no conflict tonight, Zhang can arrive on the morning of the 14th. The key to the overall situation lies in the negotiations in Peiping and Tianjin on the night of the 13th. Kato, Matsui, Tsukada, and Oki will meet with Qin Dechun, Zhang Yunrong, and Chen Juesheng, etc., on the 13th. The added Japanese troops seem to have the intention of pressuring and intimidating, wanting to force the local authorities to submit and comprehensively resolve the North China issue under armed threat, in order to realize their ideal territory.

The situation of Japanese residents in Qingdao is good under the protection of Shen, and the local area is also peaceful, so there should be no incidents. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Double-sided Personnel are still Reconciling</h3>
<p>[Peiping] The tense state of Pingjiao eased slightly tonight. The Japanese troops in Lugou Bridge, Dajing Village, and Wulidian mostly retreated to Fengtai to the east and Xiguan Head area tonight, leaving only a few Japanese troops to defend the original alert line.

If there is no conflict tonight, Zhang can arrive on the morning of the 14th. The key to the overall situation lies in the reconciliation between Pingjin and Tianjin on the night of the 13th.

<h3>Kato Visits Qin Dechun</h3>
<p>Expresses Two Japanese Hopes; Peace Slogan Suspected as a Delaying Tactic</p>
<p>[Beiping] Kato visited Qin Dechun this afternoon and stated that he was acting on orders from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Regarding the Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese government hopes for: 1. Non-expansion; 2. Local resolution. Qin stated that peace has always been China's consistent position, but it must be under the principle of preserving territorial sovereignty. Currently, the Japanese army is entering the pass in large numbers, and the front lines are not withdrawing as agreed, which is not a path to peace. Kato also felt that the Japanese diplomatic and military departments' steps were not in sync. General observation suggests that the Japanese side is singing the song of peace regarding the Lugouqiao affair, while firing guns at night and assembling a large army, forming an inevitable victory front. Their peace slogan is actually a delaying tactic. (Special dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<h3>Passengers Overcrowded on Trains Leaving Beiping and Shanghai Heading South</h3>

<h3>Qin Dechun Says Hope for Peace is Extremely Slim</h3>
<p>Situation Will Inevitably Escalate; All Demands Rejected</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Li Shijun, the representative of the 29th Army stationed in Nanjing, spoke with Beiping Mayor Qin Dechun via long-distance telephone between Nanjing and Beiping at noon on the 13th. According to Qin: ① At dawn on the morning of the 13th, about a thousand Japanese soldiers were discovered at Dahongmen, between Nanwan and Yongdingmen, and launched a fierce attack on the positions of our army near Yongdingmen and Nanwan. They were repelled by our army after two hours of fierce fighting. ② Railways in the southeastern suburbs of Beiping have been mostly destroyed by the Japanese. ③ There is no sincerity whatsoever in the so-called withdrawal of Japanese troops. They are still reinforcing their troops continuously. Although they are still sending people to negotiate with us, the hope for peace is extremely slim, and the situation will inevitably escalate. ④ The fighting in the Lugouqiao area has subsided slightly and is still being defended by troops. The positions are fortified. Also, Li asked about whether the Japanese side had proposed conditions during the continuous negotiations and whether our side had acknowledged any circumstances. Qin replied that the other side often has various demands, which have been rejected. He swore that not a single word of the treaty had been acknowledged and asked to relay this reassurance to the central government. Subsequently, Li also spoke with Sun Weidong, the Superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, and the content was similar to what Qin had said. Li has now reported what Qin and Sun said to Minister He.

<h3>US Secretary of State Cables Chinese and Japanese Ambassadors</h3>

(Reuters dispatch from Washington, 12th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull issued a warning today to the representatives of China and Japan stationed in the United States, stating that the Sino-Japanese conflict in North China will strike a blow to the world's peace and progress. At the same time, the Chinese Embassy also issued a statement saying that although both China and Japan had agreed to retreat on July 9, the Japanese army in the Beiping area has continued to increase. There are now 20,000 Japanese soldiers near Fengtai, which clearly shows that Japan has a predetermined plan, and its sole purpose is to make North China a second Manchuria. Since this incident was initiated by the Japanese side, the Japanese side should be responsible for all losses. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>[Washington] US Secretary of State Hull responded to various questions about the situation in North China today, but did not make any definite statements. When asked about British Foreign Secretary Eden's statement that the British government is currently considering discussing the matter with the United States, Hull replied that he has not yet received any information about such a move.

Hull also stated that although the Washington Naval Treaty has ended, the US government believes that other treaties concluded at the same time, such as the Nine-Power Treaty, are still in effect.

<h3>Excerpts from Newspaper Commentary in Various Countries</h3>
<p>[New York] Important newspapers here were greatly shocked by the sudden actions of Japan in North China, as if struck by lightning out of a clear sky. They all published news of the Beiping war with large headlines and in prominent positions. The American public is now fully aware of Japan's conspiracy to expand its aggressive continental policy south of the Yellow River, unlike the ignorance of a few years ago. According to observers familiar with the Far Eastern situation here, the current action of the Kwantung Army to occupy the Lugouqiao area is only the first step in consolidating Japan's power south of the Great Wall, and thereby occupying the Fengtai and Lugouqiao areas to control transportation in North China. The current attempt by the Japanese army is no different from the tactics adopted in the September 18th Incident in Shenyang. However, observers are unwilling to speculate on whether these military personnel intend to expand the puppet organization to the Beiping-Tianjin area. The People's Tribune stated in its editorial this morning that Japanese soldiers are all arrogant people who do not want to be bound by the peaceful policies of the Eastern government. If they have an opportunity, they will expand their hegemony in North China. It is hoped that the new commander of the Japanese Garrison Army in North China, Katsuki Kiyoshi, will be able to stop the Japanese army's irregular actions and save all disputes. Other American newspapers here, such as The New York Times and The Washington Post, also published commentaries on the North China war in recent days. The New York Times stated that Japan's actions came after the conflict in Heilongjiang tested the strength of the Soviet Union. The Washington Post stated that Japan's actions were no less than "playing with fire." The Sunday edition of The New York Times carried an article written by the famous writer Paul Vin, which stated that the Japanese army had three conflicts in two weeks. Although the locations of these three conflicts are far apart, their relationship is very close. Lugouqiao is a direct consequence of the unrest in East Asia and is promoted by Japan's attempt to control East Asia. Observers now believe that under the guidance of General Chiang Kai-shek, China is becoming stronger day by day and has now become a stabilizing force in the Far East. China has now unified its army, and its troops have been trained for a long time, well-armed, and extremely elite. The author then described in detail the unification of China in the past two years and concluded that if China and Japan were to go to war, Japan might gain some minor advantages in the Beiping-Tianjin area in the early stages, but the spirit of China's New Life Movement and the consolidation of China's national unity would eventually shatter Japan's dream. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the situation in North China, it is said that the reason why the United States has not yet invoked the Neutrality Act is that a peaceful resolution is not without hope. Furthermore, The New York Times today published a commentary on the North China issue, stating that Japan's arrogant re-presentation of treaty conditions, seeking to obtain certain political concessions, has once again raised the issue that Americans have been thinking about since the conquest of Manchuria in 1931: "Can Japan's ambition to dominate the five continents coexist with a unified and independent China?" The report stated that this question is also in the minds of the British, which can be seen from the statement made by British Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons yesterday.

<p>[Nanjing] The market price of government bonds has fallen in recent days due to rumors in North China. However, according to the authorities, the government bond fund is solid and has a well-established reputation, and should not be affected by the incident. As for the reason for the decline in government bonds on the 13th, it is nothing more than speculators manipulating the market.

<h3>Japanese Opinion Circles Have Formed a Nationally United Front</h3>
<p>The Overall Situation Has Reached Its Most Concerning Stage</p>
<p>[Tokyo] This morning's Asahi Shimbun editorial was entitled "Nationally United Support," stating that the strong anti-Japanese consciousness in China is the inevitable cause of the current incident. Japan's implementation of its continental policy and China's construction of a modern nation seem to be opposed to each other. To integrate them seamlessly into the national consciousness of both countries, the conflict between the two countries may be an inevitable fate. The depth of the current situation lies in this. The Mainichi Shimbun stated that how the situation will change in the future depends on China's attitude. In any case, Japan's determination has been made (it will surely make it effective until the final goal is reached). The Hochi Shimbun stated that Konoe summoned representatives from various parties, opinion circles, financial circles, and industrial circles in the middle of the night, requesting a nationally united realization of the general mobilization of intentions, which is the same attitude taken by the great powers when participating in the European war. Based on this general mobilization, a new method of permanent solution must be sought. The Miyako Shimbun advocated punishing China in order to have good results. The Chugai Commercial News stated that if China recognizes Japan's position at this time and repents, Sino-Japanese relations will be different from others, and there will be a way to reconciliation. Looking at the Japanese opinion circles as a whole, a nationally united front has been formed. The overall situation has reached its most concerning stage, or it may be difficult to recover.

<h3>War Breaks Out in the Suburbs of Beiping</h3>
<p>— Gao</p>
<p>Ever since the Japanese army provoked the Lugouqiao Incident in the form of a hasty challenge, after six days of artillery fire and hand-to-hand combat, the signs of cessation are still nowhere to be found. On the contrary, there is a tendency to expand. The war has extended to the suburbs of Beiping, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. The crisis in East Asia is like a hanging thread. It is like a rotten rope holding a great weight that is about to fall. We, who are known for our ardent love of peace, are truly unable to handle ourselves under such heavy duress. The process of this provocation is extremely bizarre. By analyzing the past events one by one, right and wrong will become clear. The number of Japanese troops currently stationed in Hebei Province has already exceeded the provisions of the Boxer Protocol. From the very beginning of their deployment, there has been much speculation. Later, they repeatedly held large-scale exercises, constantly displaying their threatening and intimidating effects. Local people have long watched with concern. However, ordinary exercises, although illegal, are still limited to daytime. This time, however, they specifically conducted night combat exercises, and held them in locations outside the treaty. This was a premeditated plan to find fault. Even a child can see the general idea. Once the dispute began, the flames of war spread quickly. Based on the principle of settling matters peacefully, our side, under extreme indignation, still tried to restrain itself so as not to expand the situation. After several oral agreements, both sides withdrew their troops, but the Japanese repeatedly broke faith, engaging in interception and attack. Troops from outside the pass continued to enter, carrying with them large amounts of military equipment. It has also been reported that two more divisions have been transferred from their country. What is their purpose? The use of such a large army is obvious to everyone. Therefore, no matter to what extent future changes may occur, the responsibility for causing the incident should be clearly borne by the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Having clarified right and wrong, let us talk about gains and losses. The Japanese, encouraged by the unexpected gains of the past, believe that our country can be treated arbitrarily and insultingly. They do not realize that the situation today is very different from the past. The government has repeatedly stated its diplomatic position, and the people have been able to shake off the past spirit of decadence. The nationally unified understanding of the concept of the nation is such that there is a trend of not being able to withstand further insult. Moreover, modern warfare is by no means limited to the two opposing countries. As the Yomiuri Shimbun said, Song Zheyuan's statement that the number of those who will perish together is not easy to predict is not without grounds. Can the Japanese side also deeply appreciate this? Some say that the Japanese side's intention was not to expand the situation, but to use the old trick of trying to gain without labor. This calculation of theirs is also wrong. It must be understood that the limit of our country's concession has reached the final critical juncture. The statement of vowing to coexist or perish with Lugouqiao is surely not enough to show the determination of our soldiers to defend it, and they must try to put on pressure in many ways. Crisis is imminent, and the consequences will be unimaginable. War is a dangerous sign. Stopping aggression is the way to self-preservation. The American report's theory of "playing with fire" can be said to be an apt metaphor. If the Japanese still have a trace of sincerity in taking care of the overall situation in East Asia, they should rein in their actions and know to do so in time. The shame of piling bottles is not only a cause of concern for us.</p>
<h3>Sino-US Formally Sign Gold and Silver Exchange Agreement</h3>

<h3>Soviet Aviators Reach American Continent</h3>
<p>Safely Flying Over the Arctic Amidst a Cyclone: Now Only a Thousand Miles from Destination</p>
<p>[Washington] The Soviet aviator Gromov, who departed from Moscow yesterday morning intending to fly directly to San Francisco via the North Pole, is progressing smoothly. After midnight, he flew through a cyclone zone and soon after sent a wireless report stating that he was safe along the way and had entered the American continent. At 8:23 this morning (4:23 PM Shanghai time), he was only 1,100 miles from his destination. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The Canadian Signal Corps received a wireless message today from the Soviet aviator Gromov's plane, stating that the aircraft is now flying 1,500 miles from the Arctic and progressing smoothly. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The plane carrying Soviet aviator Gromov recently sent a wireless message stating that it had passed the Arctic and was flying at an altitude of 2,700 meters. However, due to a hurricane on the ground, visibility was poor both above and below the aircraft. Otherwise, everything was fine. At that time, the aircraft had flown to the Western Hemisphere, 200 kilometers south of the Arctic. Another wireless message was received from the aircraft at 5:40 AM today (Greenwich time), simply stating that all was well, but without specifying its location. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet aviator Gromov departed from here at 3:10 AM today, attempting to cross the Arctic and fly to San Francisco, USA. At 2:17 PM (Greenwich time), the aircraft's position was 51 degrees east longitude and 70 degrees north latitude. At 5:28 PM, it was 56 degrees east longitude and 74 degrees north latitude. According to wireless messages sent from the aircraft, everything was safe. (Havas, Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The "ANT25" aircraft established wireless communication shortly after takeoff, reporting its position at all times. At 10:01 PM on the 12th, it had flown over Rudolf Island near the Arctic. (TASS, 13th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] According to a wireless report from the "ANT25," the aircraft flew blindly through a cyclone at 11:10 PM on the 12th. At 0:15 AM on the 13th, its position was 86 degrees north latitude and 58 degrees east longitude, flying over the cyclone at an altitude of 4,500 meters. (TASS, 13th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Local newspapers published a letter from the aviators Gromov, Yumashev, and Danilin to Stalin, which read: "We are now following in the footsteps of the heroic Chkalov, Baidukov, and Belyakov, and will do our best, in the spirit of socialist competition, to surpass their achievements. Soviet aviators will conquer the air route between Moscow, the Arctic, and the United States, making it regularly navigable. We firmly believe this is possible. No difficulties can shake our conviction. Our conviction is based on a solid foundation: excellent machinery, reliable engines, accurate instruments, and the excellent skills of the pilots, enabling us to surpass others in long-distance flight, high-altitude flight, and speed. Our struggle with nature this time is the same as that of Schmidt, Vize, Byalobrzhesky, Babushkin, Chkalov, Baidukov, and Belyakov in the past. We are by no means fighting alone, but have the backing of the entire free and happy Soviet Union and the great Party of Lenin and Stalin." (TASS, 12th)</p>
<p>Aircraft Construction</p>
<p>▲ TASS Moscow Correspondence The "ANT25" aircraft is now famous in the world of aviation and will be forever recorded in history. A year ago, Chkalov, Baidukov, and Belyakov flew this type of aircraft non-stop for 9,374 kilometers, surpassing the world record of 9,104 kilometers set by the Frenchmen Rossi and Codos. This aircraft was manufactured at the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute and designed by Sukhoi. The supervisor was the famous aircraft manufacturer Professor Tupolev. This aircraft is a cantilever monoplane with the wing located below the fuselage. The wing length exceeds that of similar aircraft by 30%, making it very fuel-efficient. Three fuel tanks are installed in the wings to make them even stronger. The landing wheels can be retracted into the wings during flight.</p>
<p>This aircraft is equipped with an "AM34" type engine, which was designed by Mikulin and has won awards at international aviation exhibitions in Paris, Milan, and Copenhagen. For the purpose of organizing the Russian-American flight, the engine has been improved and the fuselage has also been slightly modified to make the flight more stable. To ensure the comfort of the crew, the cabin is now heated with waste gas from the engine, raising the temperature inside the cabin to a level suitable for long-distance flight at an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 meters above the Arctic Ocean. In addition, oxygen equipment is installed for high-altitude flight, ensuring that no carbon dioxide gas can invade the cabin. In foggy weather, the aircraft is equipped with blind-flying equipment, and there are two sets of flight controls.</p>
<p>The "ANT25" is a land-based aircraft, but it can also float on water. In the event that the crew is forced to land on water or on an ice floe, it is equipped with a spare wireless radio, a rubber boat, and food.</p>
<p>The wireless radio installed on the aircraft is specially designed for this application. The radio is equipped with two receivers, one of which is kept as a backup. Both receivers are capable of receiving both long and short waves. In addition to telegrams, they can also receive telephone calls. The transmitter can only send Morse code telegrams. Tests have shown that the radio can communicate with locations within 6,000 kilometers. In addition, there is also a ground transceiver for use when the aircraft lands.</p>

<p>To Avoid Causing Political Turmoil, Minister of Justice Resigns from Cabinet</p>
<p>⊙ Brussels Minister of Justice Travailleur, a member of the Liberal Party, joined the cabinet in support of the amnesty bill without the party's permission, which displeased the Liberal Party. Recently, the Liberal Party demanded that Travailleur withdraw from the cabinet, otherwise the party would no longer be able to support the current government. In order to avoid causing political turmoil, Travailleur has now submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Janson. (Havas, Central News Agency, 12th)</p>

<h3>Partitioning of Palestine Opposed by Arabs and Israel</h3>
<p>⊙ Jerusalem According to local sources, 150 Islamic groups signed a declaration today stipulating that any Muslim who signs a treaty partitioning Palestine will be excommunicated. This declaration is actually the work of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and is also an expression of opposition to the King of Transjordan, who, under certain conditions, supports the partition plan. At the same time, if the King of Transjordan ascends to the throne of the Arab kingdom, the power of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem will be eliminated. It is said that the Grand Mufti will soon go to Geneva to file a protest against the partition plan and will also go to London and other European capitals to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and other dignitaries.

<h3>The Price of the Franc Shows Improvement on the London Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>[London] After studying the new tax proposals at the end of the week, French foreign exchange speculators seem to have realized that forward foreign exchange transactions will eventually be taxed, so they are closing their positions one after another. As a result, the prices of both spot and forward francs rose today. Most of the selling pressure has now shifted to the US dollar, due to fears that the French and American authorities may cooperate to investigate and punish speculators in the foreign exchange market. There are differing opinions among people in London on whether the French Finance Minister's new tax plan can recover funds flowing abroad. Some criticize the proposal to confiscate all speculative profits made during the period of tension in June, believing that this approach will not help the treasury and only smacks of opposition to capitalism. However, others say that this proposal is only a gesture by the government towards the extreme left, and it remains questionable whether it will be strictly implemented.

<h3>China's Return to Prosperity Benefits Both Britain and Japan</h3>
<p>Military Aggression Affects Trade: Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen's Statement at a Reception for the Japanese Inspection Group</p>
<p>[London] The Federation of British Industries hosted a banquet tonight for members of the Japanese Economic Inspection Group. Lord Barnby (former leader of the Federation of British Industries' economic inspection group to Japan and "Manchukuo" in 1934) delivered a speech, stating: "In the next ten years, the development of East Asian countries will be the hope for the recovery of world trade. As leaders of the business communities of Britain and Japan, we can do our best to eliminate misunderstandings and enhance friendship between the two countries. If this is the case, it will not only be fortunate for the two countries, but also contribute to the security and prosperity of the world. I believe the gentlemen of the Japanese inspection group will also agree with this statement." Subsequently, Shigekuro Monono, head of the Japanese inspection group, rose to respond, mentioning Lord Barnby's visit to Japan three years ago, saying that this visit resulted in mutual understanding between the business communities of the two countries. "I also believe that the results of our discussions in recent days are sufficient to allow both sides to understand various facts and each other's views on these facts. This is very valuable and very beneficial. In short, as far as the trade relationship between Britain and Japan is concerned, there is no situation that would make us feel that the traditional friendship between the two countries is in danger of being seriously harmed." (Havas, Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>[London] Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, Chief Economic Advisor to the British Government, continued to speak, referring to the current situation in China, saying that tanks and military trucks are not the best commercial salesmen. He hopes that common sense will prevail and overcome all difficulties. He is pleased to see that Japanese trade with China has expanded in the past eighteen months, but he believes that if there is a better understanding between China and Japan, Japanese trade with China will improve even more. If China's territorial integrity and its ordinary sovereignty are not respected, then events similar to the current conflict will inevitably occur frequently. Only if China becomes more prosperous can we hope to increase trade with China. Among all countries, Japan will benefit the most from China's prosperity. Therefore, the most beneficial thing for both Britain and Japan is for the two countries to cooperate to make China strong and peaceful again. For the sake of mutual benefit, he has high hopes for the future of British-Japanese relations. Now that Japanese trade is expanding, this is the best opportunity to clear up misunderstandings and improve commercial relations. As for the current import quota system, he advocates replacing it with another system that is beneficial to both Britain and Japan. The Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigeru Yoshida, rose to reply.

Mussolini suggested that representatives from Britain and Italy could hold a round-table conference to discuss the Abyssinian issue and all other issues. According to reports, Lansbury will visit the Vatican leader today before returning to Britain tomorrow, and will visit Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Poland in the near future.

<h3>Germany Proposes Four Demands; Austria Has Already Rejected Them</h3>
<p>Germany's Attitude Temporarily Relaxes</p>
<p>[Paris] Madame Tabouis, the diplomatic correspondent for the "事业报," recently declared that the German government had recently made four demands on Austria: ㊀ Allow members of the Nazi Party to join the Austrian Schuschnigg cabinet; ㊁ Repeal all laws against the Nazi Party and grant amnesty to all Nazi criminals; ㊂ Prohibit any anti-Nazi Party debate in Austrian newspapers; ㊃ Allow German newspapers to be freely transported into Austria. The above four demands were submitted to the German-Austrian Mixed Committee for discussion. The Austrian members immediately expressed their rejection. German Minister to Austria Papen, due to Austria's strong attitude, requested German leader Hitler to adopt a moderate attitude and not to act rashly. Hitler has also decided not to take any drastic action in Central Europe and the Balkan Peninsula until the Spanish Civil War is over. (Havas, Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Britain Again Proposes a Compromise Solution to France, Germany, and Italy</h3>
<p>British House of Commons Discusses the Spanish Issue; French Border Monitoring Methods Have Been Suspended</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden is now scheduled to meet with the ambassadors of France, Russia, Germany, and Italy this afternoon to personally present the compromise solution proposed by the British government, so that it can be submitted for discussion at the meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War on the 16th of this month. (Havas, Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>[London] A compromise solution to the Spanish Civil War non-intervention measures is currently being drafted by Foreign Secretary Eden and experts from the Foreign Office. This solution is roughly divided into the following two items: ㊀ A temporary plan will be adopted for maritime monitoring of Spain, in which naval vessels from Britain and France will patrol all Spanish waters, and observers from Germany and Italy will monitor on board the vessels; ㊁ A concrete plan will be stipulated for future implementation. The details of this plan are unknown, but it roughly advocates the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries within Spain, or the recognition of the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups. Cabinet members related to national defense also gathered at the Prime Minister's Office today to study whether it is feasible to allow observers from Germany and Italy to board British naval vessels participating in the monitoring. Semi-official sources are still pessimistic, fearing that Germany and Italy will not accept either of the above two plans. If so, the non-intervention measures will inevitably collapse completely. In that case, it is still hoped that all countries will at least respect the ban on volunteers traveling to Spain. If foreign volunteers continue to enter Spain in large numbers, international conflict will inevitably escalate, and the future is extremely dangerous. (Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>[London] The Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War is scheduled to meet on Friday, at which time the British government will report on its efforts to find a solution to the impasse in the Spanish maritime monitoring plan. When members of the House of Commons asked about this issue at today's meeting, Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the government is well aware of the difficulties in handling this matter and the urgency of the issue, and will naturally fulfill its responsibilities as quickly and seriously as possible. The government is currently actively engaged in the necessary work on the report. The Foreign Secretary then referred to the French government's announcement that it would suspend all facilities currently provided to foreign observers stationed on the French-Spanish border from tomorrow unless the monitoring of the Portuguese border is restored to its previous state, saying that he had heard that the observers would still be allowed to remain in place, and that all relevant French orders would remain in effect. Members also asked about the nature of the proposals that Britain intends to put forward at the Non-Intervention Committee meeting on Friday, but the Foreign Secretary declined to disclose them in advance. The Foreign Secretary also answered other questions about the Spanish Civil War, saying that he is well aware of the importance of non-Spanish volunteers withdrawing from Spain and establishing fair air and sea monitoring. The Foreign Secretary also replied that the British consul would return to Bilbao as soon as possible, and that an official had already gone there to take over the consulate and all documents. The Foreign Secretary concluded by mentioning the mining industry in Bilbao, saying that to his knowledge, General Franco, the leader of the Nationalist forces, and representatives of the British companies involved had not yet begun negotiations.

<p>⊙ Bobigny, France After the international monitoring measures currently in place on the border between France and Spain were suspended from noon today, the monitoring director, Danish Colonel Lund, and all the monitors have withdrawn to this place to await further orders. The monitoring work they left behind will be taken over by French personnel, and the border between France and Spain will continue to be blockaded. (Havas, Central News Agency, 13th)</p>

At the same time, international monitoring personnel will cease to perform their duties. According to well-informed sources in France, the takeover of the monitoring work by French officials does not mean the cessation of the monitoring work. The execution of the monitoring work will be as strict as before. (National Haitong Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] French Ambassador to Germany François-Poncet visited Foreign Minister Neurath this morning, informing him that German newspapers often publish distorted or even completely inaccurate French official news, which is very harmful, and requested that the German government pay attention to this matter. Regarding the French government's decision to suspend the monitoring measures on the border between France and Spain, the German semi-official agency Deutsche Nachrichten-Agentur recently published a fragmented version of the communique issued by the French government, with numerous errors. Although a correction was requested, it had no effect. The French Ambassador raised this issue today. (Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>[London] General Franco, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist forces, previously issued a note which was forwarded to the British government by the Portuguese government. The note expressed concern about the political nature of Italian aid to the Nationalist forces and stated that the Nationalist government was willing to conclude an agreement with Britain to obtain financial and economic assistance from Britain. However, General Franco subsequently issued another note to the governments of various countries, including Britain, stating that if the countries do not recognize the Nationalist government as a belligerent group, they will impose economic retaliation on these countries in the future. The wording of these two notes is contradictory, and British government officials are puzzled. Spanish sources here believe that after the first note from General Franco to the British government was issued, it was learned by the German and Italian governments, which then exerted strong pressure on the Nationalist government, ordering it not to get close to Britain again. Therefore, General Franco issued the second note to clarify his position. Spanish sources further believe that General Franco had no choice but to comply with the wishes of Germany and Italy and issue threats to various countries. From this, it can be seen to what extent the Nationalist government relies on Germany and Italy, and the plight of General Franco in seeking to change his policy and maintain a more independent position can also be seen.

<h3>The Socialist Party Continues its Congress</h3>
<p>Debating Policy</p>
<p>⊙Marseille. The Socialist Party's National Congress continued this afternoon. Léon Blum, the leader of the left-wing revolutionary faction, delivered a speech, severely criticizing the actions of the former Blum cabinet. He stated that although the previous cabinet possessed patience and skillful tactics, it was still insufficient to curb speculative activities. The enemies engaged in speculative manipulation still exist. If we want to curb such behavior now, it cannot be achieved solely through parliamentary struggle; it requires the action of the masses. Blum then listed various instances of the former Blum cabinet "capitulating to capitalists," saying that Blum himself once claimed that if he had requested full financial powers from the parliament at the beginning of his administration in June 1936, the Senate would definitely have approved it. However, as a result, Blum was unwilling to seek assistance from the people's will to fight, and only used his skills in the parliament's lounge, achieving nothing. Blum finally requested that all Socialist Party cabinet members withdraw from the Chautemps Cabinet, so that they could fully agree with the General Confederation of Labor, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Communist Party to form a fighting cabinet with the Socialist Party as the main body. Subsequently, State Councillor Blum delivered a speech amidst the cheers of the attending representatives, recalling the situation when he took office a year ago, and said, "I do not consider myself a failure at present. After we took office, we deeply changed the lives of the people, increased general purchasing power, and brought the national economy to the point of recovery." Speaking of the Spanish issue, he said that he was responsible for promoting the non-intervention policy in the Spanish Civil War. The reason why the Spanish Civil War did not transform into a pan-European war was due to the non-intervention policy. "Even regarding the bombing of the German cruiser Deutschland, if there had been no non-intervention policy, dangerous consequences might have occurred. In short, freedom is by no means guaranteed by war." "Now that Germany and Italy have withdrawn from the naval surveillance plan, France has entered the most dangerous zone, but France also has interests vital to its survival that should be protected." Finally, regarding the Senate issue, he said that the election methods for the House of Representatives and the Senate are different, but their powers are equal. The coexistence of the two houses is very obstructive. Moreover, no constitution in any country grants the Senate such absolute veto power as France. The Socialist Party should now study the constitutional issue of the Senate's existence." Blum's speech lasted two and a half hours before it ended. All the representatives in the hall cheered enthusiastically for him. (Central News Agency, Havas, 13th)</p>

<h3>A Glimpse Between Lugou Bridge and Wanping After the Twenty-Ninth Army Accepted the Order to Resist the Enemy</h3>
<p>Japanese Soldiers' Fierce Flames Soar, Massacring Civilians Everywhere. Wanping is Under Strict Guard, and Our Army's Morale is Strong.</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence, late on the 7th, the Japanese army suddenly bombarded Lugou Bridge, and our Twenty-Ninth Army rose up to resist for legitimate defense. The fighting temporarily ceased only at 4 p.m. on the 8th. Both sides suffered casualties, and farmers in Dajing Village were brutally massacred by the Japanese army. After the ceasefire, the reporter specially drove out of Zhangyi Gate to inspect the Lugou Bridge and Wanping area. Gunfire was heard from time to time halfway there. When arriving at Wanping, the city gate was tightly closed, filled with sandbags inside, and our soldiers were on strict guard on the city wall, with high morale. The reporter asked the guards on the city wall outside the city about the method of entering the city. According to the soldiers, the north gate could not be opened, and only the east gate might be passable, but there were many enemy soldiers in the southeast corner, and accidents might inevitably occur. In order to see the truth, the reporter ventured forward. Unexpectedly, just after arriving at the east of the city, several gunshots were heard. The soldiers on the city wall immediately stopped us from proceeding, saying that the Japanese army had seen you and opened fire as a warning. If you don't retreat quickly, you will be in danger. The reporter then turned back to the north gate. Gunfire continued intermittently on the way back. About half a mile from the city, I suddenly saw a military vehicle and a private car parked in the middle of the road. Five heavily armed Japanese soldiers stood on the roadside with guns. The car was carrying about forty or fifty poorly dressed Japanese and Korean plainclothes teams, holding pistols, box cannons, and rifles, ready to shoot. The reporter ordered the driver to speed past. When the car reached the railway bridge hole, I suddenly saw a rickshaw puller running wildly with the rickshaw. Blood was dripping from his thigh. He was extremely embarrassed. The reporter stopped the car and asked the reason. According to him, when he was pulling a passenger through the railway bridge hole, he did not know that pedestrians were prohibited from passing there. The Japanese army did not explain and stabbed him in the thigh with a bayonet. The wound was about three inches deep, so blood was flowing like a fountain. The injury was extremely tragic. The reporter knew that it was impossible to stay there any longer and drove quickly back to the city. Along the way, Japanese military vehicles and motorcycles came and went in an endless stream, extremely busy. In addition to a large team of Japanese troops surrounding Wanping County, a large number of Japanese soldiers transferred from Tianjin arrived in Ping on the afternoon of the 8th. At the same time, a team of Japanese soldiers from Fengtai took many heavy trucks and drove to Shagangzi, five miles from Lugou Bridge, to deploy defenses. In addition, more than a hundred Japanese soldiers in Beiping took four cars and attempted to drive to Longwang Temple from the west gate of Beiping, but were stopped by our army and returned to Beiping. At about 11 a.m. on the 8th, a soldier of ours was stabbed to death with a bayonet by a Japanese sentry at Lugou Bridge Station. Now, in addition to the strict guard by our military police inside Zhangyi Gate, there are also troops stationed and sentries deployed outside the city and in nearby areas. Pedestrians have disappeared from the highway and railway near Zhangyi Gate and Wulidian. Only a row of armed police patrols back and forth. Japanese soldiers are stationed everywhere near Lugou Bridge. Plainclothes Japanese people in groups of three or five are scattered in moats and low-lying areas, with extremely fierce faces. Japanese soldiers often go out to search and arrest farmers, forcing them to build fortifications and transport supplies and ammunition. If they are slightly dissatisfied, they will be killed. The Japanese army in Lugou Bridge and other places is well-prepared, and its armed strength is very strong. In addition, there are more than a hundred Japanese soldiers, most of whom are wearing plain clothes, scattered in the farmland near Wanping, using sorghum and rice fields as cover, and arbitrarily shooting at passers-by. More than a dozen sentries are stationed at the Lugou Bridge iron bridge. All pedestrians going west are blocked and returned. At nine o'clock in the morning on the 8th, a shoemaker who was passing by was also killed by a Japanese soldier with a bayonet. After the conflict temporarily stopped, we checked inside Wanping City and found that more than 50 soldiers and civilians were killed, and more than 60 were injured. The Japanese are still deploying troops to reinforce. Our loyal and brave soldiers of the Twenty-Ninth Army are also determined to continue fighting bravely to defend the territory when all hope of peace is lost. (9th)</p>
<h3>Northeast Foreign Trade Statistics for June</h3>
<p>Import Surplus Exceeded 24.9 Million Yuan. Japanese Goods' Dumping in the Northeast Greatly Expands.</p>
<p>Dalian Correspondence, according to the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry's announcement, the Northeast foreign trade statistics for June of this year are as follows (unit: thousand yuan):</p>
<p>Exports 48,889</p>
<p>Imports 73,793</p>
<p>Total 122,682</p>
<p>Import Surplus 24,904</p>
<p>The above exports decreased by 7.24 million compared with the previous month. Although the exports of special products decreased during the summer off-season, they increased by 13.3 million compared with the same period last year. If the cumulative amount since January is 35.27 million, it exceeds the cumulative export amount of the same period last year by about 8.6 million. However, the imports are even more vigorous, increasing by 13.4 million compared with the same period last year. If the cumulative import amount since January reaches 40.67 million, the cumulative import surplus is 54 million. Furthermore, the exports to Japan in June were 23.48 million, accounting for 48% of the total exports, while the imports were 54.07 million, accounting for 75% of the total imports. It can be seen that the dumping power of Japanese goods in the Northeast has expanded.</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Establishes Cotton Planting Guidance Institute</h3>
<p>Drafting a Six-Year Plan to Improve Cotton Production Throughout the Province. Production and Income Will Increase Sharply in Five Years.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence. The Construction Department of the Shandong Provincial Government has established the Shandong Provincial Cotton Planting Guidance Institute to improve cotton planting technology and increase cotton production income in Shandong Province. Hu Changzhun has been appointed as the director of the institute, which was officially established on June 1st and started working. The institute has now set up American cotton original seed fields in five counties including Shanghe and cooperative breeding fields in four counties including Qidong. Two instructors have been assigned to each field and have gone to the respective counties to conduct trials. To understand its work situation, the reporter specially visited Hu Changzhun, the director of the institute. The following is a record of his conversation.</p>
<p>Cotton Seed Improvement</p>
<p>According to Director Hu, the institute was preparing in April and officially established on June 1st. Regarding the improvement of cotton seeds, it is planned to implement it for six years. The first year is for the cotton field, with the cotton improvement field supplying 15,000 jin of cotton seeds. The second year is for the original seed field, that is, the seeds supplied by the cotton field are transported to various cotton-producing counties and distributed to cotton farmers for trial planting, and personnel are sent to provide guidance at any time. The third year is for the cooperative breeding field, that is, the seeds supplied by the original seed field are gradually promoted in the counties. The fourth year is for the purebred area, which can be planted in designated areas in each county to become a purebred area. In the fifth year, the cotton seeds can be handed over to the joint society or cotton farmers to promote planting in several areas. In the sixth year, enough seeds will be collected to supply the entire county, and the cotton quality of the entire county or province will be unified.</p>
<p>Guidance and Promotion</p>
<p>After its establishment, the institute immediately set up American cotton original seed fields and cooperative breeding fields in various cotton-producing counties. ① American cotton original seed fields were set up in five counties including Shanghe, Bin County, Gaotang, Xiajin, and Guantao. They have now reached the second year of the cotton seed improvement program. All the required cotton seeds are supplied by the cotton improvement field. ② Cooperative breeding fields are being trialled in four counties including Linqing, Qiuxian, Huimin, and Qidong. All four counties have trialled up to the third year of the cotton seed program. It is expected that in five or six years, not only will the cotton yield of farmers increase and the quality improve, but also the quality of cotton on the market will be standardized.</p>
<p>Cotton Insect Control</p>
<p>The Construction Department believes that if there is a prolonged drought in late June and early July every year, cotton seedlings are prone to aphids, so it has specially cooperated with the Central Cotton Production Improvement Society to prevent and control them. This year, trials are being conducted in ten counties including Linqing, Xiajin, Gaotang, Tangyi, Shanghe, Huimin, Bin County, Putai, and Boxing. Two to three instructors are assigned to each county, and twenty demonstration fields are set up, with instructors guiding farmers in prevention and control. Each county is also issued a certain number of sprayers by the Construction Department, and the agents are supplied by the joint societies. The application methods are divided into two types: ① spraying method, ② dipping method. The agents are also divided into two types: ① cotton oil emulsion, the composition of which is a mixture of water, alkali, and extracted oil liquid, costing about three cents per mu; ② cotton oil soap, which is a mixture of water and cotton seed oil residue, costing only two cents per mu. The prevention and control results are very good, and the future promotion will definitely be effective. (8th)</p>

<h3>Ambassador Xu Decides to Depart for Japan on the 17th</h3>
<p>Because of the Lugou Bridge Incident, He Resolves to Return to His Post for the Sake of the Country</p>
<p>Ambassador Xu Shiying, stationed in Japan for many years, has dedicated himself to national affairs, working tirelessly and fulfilling his mission without failing. He has become ill from overwork and suffers from acute otitis media. The illness was not mild, and he only recovered after three months of treatment. However, due to his advanced age and prolonged illness, he has not yet regained his health and is still under medical care every day. He has repeatedly and earnestly resigned to the central government, but they have repeatedly comforted him and asked him to stay. Xu felt that his physical condition was too weak to cope with the arduous work, and he reiterated his request. However, recently, the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred. Xu was deeply concerned due to his responsibilities. Seeing the seriousness of the situation, he was filled with patriotic feelings and worried day and night. He specially sent the embassy secretary, Huang Bodu, to Beijing to inquire about the recent situation in North China from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and seek instructions on everything. He received a reply from President Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang, stating that the relationship between China and Japan was tense and relied on his talents to mediate. They urged Ambassador Xu to cancel his resignation and return to his post immediately. Social opinion also hoped that he would continue to take on the difficult situation. Xu is physically weak, old, and has not yet recovered from his illness. He is truly unable to cope with the arduous work. However, considering the situation and the importance of national affairs, at this time of crisis, it is time to serve the country. He disregards his own health and resolves to obey the order to return to Japan as soon as possible. President Chiang and Minister Wang sent telegrams of praise and urged him to leave immediately on the previous two days. He originally planned to leave immediately, but the nearest ship to Japan was the President Coolidge of the Da Lai Company on the night of the 16th. He will take that ship and depart on the 17th. He plans to land in Kobe and immediately take a train to Tokyo. However, as the departure is too rushed, there are still official matters to be handled in the country. It is said that Secretary Huang will be left in the country to expedite the remaining matters and will take the next ship to Japan.</p>
<h3>Actions of the Japanese Military and Civilians After the Lugou Bridge Incident in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Two Warships Arrive</p>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reported that at 12:00 noon yesterday, two more Japanese destroyers sailed into Shanghai. Both belonged to the 16th Destroyer Squadron of the Third Fleet and were moored near the Mobil Wharf. Previously, there were only two Japanese warships in the Huangpu River. After the Izumo arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, two more ships arrived yesterday, bringing the total to five.</p>
<p>Extraordinary Preparations</p>
<p>The Shenzhou News Agency reported that since the Lugou Bridge Incident, the situation has become serious.

It is reported that the Japanese financial community has been ordered to be particularly cautious about entrusted matters. Japanese yarn factories are planning to send women and children back to their country when necessary.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Return Home</p>
<p>The Hua Dong News Agency reported that the Japanese mail ship Nagasaki Maru, which departed at 9:00 AM yesterday, carried more than 40 Japanese residents of Shanghai. However, they were all voluntary and not under the orders of the Japanese Residents' Office.</p>

<h3>Grain Trade Groups in This City Prevent Grain Supplies from Aiding the Enemy</h3>
<p>Japanese Purchase Rice and Wheat for Export from Our Country's Production Areas; Also Order Two Million Dan of Foreign Rice from Siam</p>
<p>Since the Lugou Bridge Incident, national sentiment has been aroused throughout the country. Telegrams have been sent to the central government and various generals in North China, urging them to defend the national territory. The Grain Trade Association of this city, considering that the situation is tense, is concerned that unscrupulous members of the industry may supply the enemy with grain, affecting the people's food supply. They have scheduled a general meeting to discuss strict prevention measures. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Goods Such as Dalian Products Continue to be Exported</p>
<p>Large quantities of grain, such as rice and wheat, are packaged and exported from this city to Dalian, Taiwan, and other places every day. Although most of it is supplied to overseas Chinese in those areas for food, a portion is still secretly purchased by the Japanese. Since the Japanese army provoked the Lugou Bridge Incident in North China, merchants from Dalian and Taiwan stationed in Shanghai have been actively ordering rice and grain in Shanghai. They are also purchasing directly from the rice-producing areas of Huzhou and Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province under the guise of experts, shipping them to Shanghai, and then transferring them to merchant ships of a certain country for export. The amount is more than it was last month.</p>
<p>Preventing Members of the Trade from Supplying Grain to the Enemy</p>
<p>The Grain Trade Association, at this critical time of national crisis, is deeply concerned that unscrupulous members of the industry may disregard national interests and seize the opportunity to make profits by supplying grain to the enemy, which is a betrayal of their patriotic duty. Therefore, they are implementing prevention measures and have scheduled a special meeting of all members and merchants in the city this week to discuss strict prevention measures. At the same time, they will handle city-wide grain statistics and re-export inspections. They have concrete plans to balance market prices during emergencies.</p>
<p>Siam Rice Shipments to Japan Increase Sharply</p>
<p>Japan's plan to implement special policies in North China is a long-standing ambition. The outbreak of the Lugou Bridge Incident was preceded by years of military food preparations. According to reporters from the Ta Kung Pao, the Japanese, in addition to secretly purchasing rice and wheat from rice-producing provinces in our country, have also ordered large quantities of Siam rice from Siam for shipment to Japan, amounting to more than two million dan. This grain is said to be for military purposes.</p>
<p>Large Shipments of Grain to the North Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Reporters for this newspaper have learned that since the Lugou Bridge Incident, the shipping industry in Shanghai has been severely affected on the Beiyang route. Last Saturday, a large amount of flour and grain was still being shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin. Since the beginning of the week (i.e., the 12th), the Beiyang gangs of various merchants in Shanghai have stopped trading due to the intermittent military conflict in the north and the obstruction of transportation. In addition to suspending the shipment of goods, the large amount of flour and huge amounts of grain that had already been reported for shipment have also been suspended as of yesterday. According to people in the Beiyang shipping business, the amount of wheat flour and grain purchased in Shanghai by Tianjin and other places is enormous. The value of the goods waiting to be shipped is estimated at 1 to 3 million yuan. Now, due to the deteriorating situation, the wheat flour and miscellaneous grains have been telegraphed to Shanghai to be temporarily stored in Shanghai until the situation improves before deciding whether to ship them. Also, the shipment of goods from Shanghai to Yantai, Qingdao, and other places has declined sharply since yesterday. The Beiyang shipping business of the six companies has been severely affected. However, the transportation of goods in the Yangtze River and South China regions has not been significantly affected at present. However, various customs declaration agencies have agreed with various merchants that, during this serious national crisis, they will agree that all goods reported for shipment by Chinese people will be loaded onto Chinese ships, regardless of whether foreign ships offer lower freight rates. It has also been agreed to persuade Chinese people to take Chinese ships in the future to show their sincerity in protecting the country.</p>
<h3>American Ships Dismiss Chinese Crew Members for Repatriation</h3>
<p>First Batch Expected to Arrive Within a Week; Those Dismissed Are All from Guangdong</p>
<p>The three passenger ships of the China-America line of the American-owned Pacific Shipping Company in this city will suspend service and withdraw their schedules from next week. All the Chinese crew members on the three ships, such as cooks, servants, stokers, and sailors, totaling one hundred and dozens, have been dismissed. According to the company, the Chinese crew members of the Generals Sherman and Lee ships have been sent to Shanghai by the United States and will be transferred to Hong Kong (because most are from Guangdong) for disbandment within a week. The Chinese crew members of the General Pershing will arrive in Shanghai next month. In addition, the Chinese crew members dismissed from various ships of the Da Lai Shipping Company are said to be on their way and will also be sent to Hong Kong for disbandment.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi and Chen Shaokuan Will Return to China Ahead of Schedule</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Leave the United States for Europe Today for a Short Rest; Expected to Arrive in Shanghai by the End of Next Month or Early September</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, was dispatched as a special envoy for the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor. After being abroad for several months, he originally planned to return to China in November. However, in view of the outbreak of war in the north and the increasing national crisis, he has decided to return ahead of schedule. According to sources from the Central Bank, Kong is scheduled to leave the United States for Europe today. It is estimated that he will arrive in Germany in eleven days and stay there for about three or four weeks for a short rest. Then, he will return to China immediately and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of next month or early September. It is also learned that Chen Shaokuan, Vice Envoy and Minister of the Navy, who participated in the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor, will also return to China ahead of schedule and may travel with Kong.</p>
<h3>French Officials and Citizens in Shanghai to Celebrate National Day Today</h3>

<h3>Security in This City Not a Concern</h3>
<p>Ample Arrangements and Preparations in Place; Traffic Between Shanghai and Beiping Still Obstructed</p>

Reporters from the Shenzhou News Agency interviewed those responsible for the security of this city. They said that amid the serious situation in North China, various aspects of this city have inevitably become slightly more tense. However, the authorities have made ample arrangements and preparations for the security of this city and can guarantee that there is no cause for concern. In addition, the traffic between this city and Beiping, the Shanghai-Beiping military and China airlines are still terminated in Tianjin. Before the situation changes, there is no certainty of reaching it in the near future. However, telecommunications and traffic are still smooth and have not been affected.</p>

It has come to our attention that, with the election nearing, the office yesterday assigned staff to all polling stations in the district. Furthermore, the office yesterday invited candidates Su Liping and Zhu Fengwei to broadcast. Today, it has invited five candidates including Xu Jiting to give broadcast speeches. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Assignment of Staff to Polling Stations</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the Election Law and its implementation rules, each polling station should have election supervisors, inspectors, managers, and assistants appointed by the election supervisor to oversee and manage the voting process. It is reported that the Municipal National Assembly Election Office, considering that the municipal election is scheduled for the 18th of this month (Sunday), deemed it necessary to assign all polling station supervisors, managers, and other staff in advance to notify them for preparation. Therefore, yesterday, the Municipal Election Supervisor assigned 99 supervisors, over a hundred managers, and over a hundred assistants to the 99 polling stations in the city. These notifications were issued yesterday.</p>
<p>Key Points of Su and Zhu's Broadcasts</p>
<p>Yesterday, the National Assembly Election Office specially invited candidates Su Liping and Zhu Fengwei to broadcast separately on the Yuanchang and Zhongxi radio stations, speaking on the significance of convening the National Assembly and the importance of the constitution. Zhang Hanyun was also assigned to report on various regulations at the Ministry of Communications radio station. As the municipal election is approaching, citizens have been paying close attention.

<h3>Mass Resignation of All Workers at Hengfengyong Carpet Factory</h3>
<p>Refusal to Resume Work Unless Arrested Workers Are Released; Wages Settled and Departure from Factory Yesterday</p>
<p>The Hengfengyong Carpet Factory at 2452 Jilu Road, Xuhui, is a leading name in China's handmade carpet industry, boasting top-notch internal equipment in Shanghai. The factory's hundred-plus workers, mostly apprentices, enjoyed harmonious labor-management relations and fair treatment. Not affiliated with any labor union, the workers, on the 7th of this month, used the pretext of celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Municipal Government to request a day off. The factory, stating it hadn't received orders from authorities, couldn't independently grant the holiday. Management's dissuasion proved futile, and the information was reported to the business department. Assistant Manager Zhou Youliang and Director Liu Huashan rushed to the scene, declaring the holiday unnecessary and repeatedly urging workers to work. Unexpectedly, the workers used iron rulers, wooden sticks, and other implements to severely injure Zhou and Liu. The workers then guarded the front and back factory gates and the telephone. Later, an employee managed to escape and reported to the Jinjiqiao and Xuhui police stations, who dispatched officers to escort the injured to Zhongshan Hospital and detain eight workers for instigating the violence. After investigation, the court ordered bail pending trial. The Xuhui police station, led by Inspector Guan, earnestly persuaded the workers to resume work, but they stubbornly refused and remained in the factory. The nearby Garrison Command, aware of the large number of workers and fearing disruption to local order, dispatched Section Chief Li and eight soldiers to monitor the factory and instruct the workers to resume work, but they were ignored. Subsequently, workers Song Hekun, Wang Guiyuan, Zuo Cunfan, Xu Ximeng, Wang Tingzhen, Liu Xuezhi, Cao Baoling, Mao Yangui, Cheng Naigui, Qiu Yusheng, Guo Jinhai, Fang Qiandao, Liu Decheng, and Huang Yiyun, fourteen in total, were detained and sent to the Command. The afternoon before yesterday, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, Dai Jun, went to inquire about the incident. The Command also sent Deputy Officer Tan to mediate the resumption of work. The 78 workers remaining in the factory unanimously insisted that they would not resume work until the arrested workers were released on bail and applied to voluntarily leave the factory on the spot. After repeated persuasion proved fruitless, the factory settled the workers' wages at around 5 PM, paying them by name before they departed. When the reporter visited yesterday, Factory Director Wang stated that the workers' lack of knowledge made them easily manipulated, and he deeply regretted that such a minor incident had escalated into such a major disturbance. He then led a tour of the factory, where most work had ceased except for a few apprentices still working.</p>

<h3>The Yarn Exchange Manipulation Case Postponed to the 16th for Investigation</h3>
<p>虞洽卿谈此案注重证据问题　穆藕初尚在庐前传返沪不确</p>
<p>虞洽卿谈此案注重证据问题　穆藕初尚在庐前传返沪不确</p>
<p>虞 Qiaqing Speaks on the Importance of Evidence in the Case; Rumors of Mu Ouchu's Return to Shanghai from Lu are Incorrect</p>
<p>The Shanghai society's yarn exchange manipulation and speculation frenzy, since the order to transfer Tax Bureau Chief Wu Qiding and Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Unified Tax Bureau Chief Mai Shengxian, suspected of manipulation, to the First Special District Local Court for violating the Literary Exchange Regulations and parts of the Criminal Law, has been meticulously investigated by Prosecutor Song Genshan of the court. Initially, the court scheduled the third interrogation for this Thursday. Recently, it was heard that the court, for some reason, decided to postpone it by one day and scheduled it for 9 AM on the 16th in the court's Fifth Civil Chamber to continue the interrogation. The summonses have also been issued. It is heard that the important new witnesses summoned this time include Yu Qiaqing and four or five others, while three or four old witnesses have been re-summoned, totaling seven or eight people. The defendants Wu and Sheng will also surrender themselves. In addition, President Jiang, in order to thoroughly investigate the matter, had previously telegraphed Shanghai Local Association President Du Yuesheng, business elder Yu Qiaqing, China Farmers Bank General Manager Ye Zhuotang, and Exchange Chairman Mu Ouchu to Lushan for consultation. Now, Du and others have returned to Shanghai after completing their public duties. According to Yu, "This trip to Lushan lasted three days, and I had two meetings with President Jiang. However, due to Jiang's busy schedule, the meetings only lasted ten minutes or so. The report on the Shanghai yarn craze concluded that the focus should be on evidence, and the entire matter should be transferred to the judicial organs for investigation according to the law. However, it is not appropriate to make public statements before the investigation is completed." Currently, Mu Ouchu is still in Lushan. The news report that he returned to Shanghai with us is incorrect. As for Wu Ruiyuan and Xu Maochang being summoned to Lushan, it was to inquire about the names of the clients represented by these brokers.</p>
<h3>Active Implementation of Epidemic Prevention Movement in This City</h3>
<p>Mosquitoes and Gnats Rampant, Many People Suffering from Malaria; Mosquito Eradication Work Especially Tense</p>
<p>The epidemic prevention movement in this city is still being actively implemented. Due to the increasing number of malaria cases caused by mosquitoes and gnats, both the Chinese and Concession health organizations have organized mosquito eradication teams to eliminate the problem. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Epidemic Prevention Injections</p>
<p>According to a message from the Zhabei Health Office yesterday, epidemic prevention injections for residents of shantytowns in the northern district of Shanghai are being actively carried out with increased personnel. Injections in rural areas have also begun. The injections for third and fourth class train passengers are progressing satisfactorily due to the assistance of the health departments of the two railway administrations.</p>
<p>Inspection of Ships</p>
<p>The Wusong Quarantine Hospital of the Seaport Quarantine Office has also opened in anticipation of the summer season, paying particular attention to imported ships that require quarantine inspection. Therefore, both sea and land defenses can be considered thorough. According to the Seaport Quarantine Office, as of now, no cases of cholera have been discovered in any ports nationwide, and Shanghai is especially peaceful.</p>
<p>Mosquito Eradication Work</p>
<p>This summer, mosquitoes and gnats are still rampant in the Public Concession area, as evidenced by the large number of malaria patients attending the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital. Therefore, the work of the Health Department's mosquito eradication team is extremely tense, but it is difficult to completely eradicate the problem. In the urban area, the Municipal Health Bureau has also organized mosquito and fly eradication teams to work in Chanchuan and other areas in western Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Fatal Mistake of Using Cigarette Ash to Treat Diarrhea</h3>
<p>Huang Tianxi Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Huang Tianxi, a young man from Shaoxing, 21 years old, worked in the Chinese Concession and was currently employed at the Kang Yutang Chinese pharmacy at 51 Notre Dame Road in the French Concession. Recently, he suffered from diarrhea for four days. Unable to find relief after taking medicine, he felt at 10 PM on the 12th that consuming opium ash would cure his illness and stop the diarrhea. Unexpectedly, he overdosed, leading to poisoning. At 7 AM yesterday morning, a roommate, Yu Zhicheng (29 years old, from Suzhou), discovered him and informed his colleagues in the store. After deliberation, they sent him to the Red Cross General Hospital on Haige Road. However, his organs were already severely poisoned, and rescue efforts were unsuccessful. He died one hour after admission, at 8:30 AM. The hospital reported the incident to the French Concession police as usual. The Fuxu Police Station dispatched detectives to investigate and sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch mortuary for autopsy, pending a request to the Second Special Court today to send personnel for examination. The deceased's family is still in their hometown of Shaoxing. The store has telegraphed them to come to Shanghai to claim the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Drowning While Retrieving a Jar</h3>
<p>Tragic Death by Drowning</p>
<p>In Youchetou, the fourth bao of Beiqiao Town in the third district of Shanghai County, near the Zhugang River, about a mile from Yutangbei, lived Xu Ada, 37 years old, a farmer. The day before yesterday (the 9th), at 4 PM, the neighboring Weng family had immersed several pig feed jars on the stone bridge in the river to wash them. Later, the tide came and the water rose, carrying the jars northward about thirty feet away. Ada happened to see them by the river and tried to retrieve them with his hoe, but the handle was too short. Forgetting that he was not a skilled swimmer, he jumped into the water to retrieve them. The pig feed jars were swept away and sank into the river, which was deep and flowing rapidly. Ada also lost his footing and drowned. After a while, he floated up and down in the river. A grass cutter saw this and, realizing something was wrong, rushed over and jumped into the water to try to save him, but was unable to. He frantically shouted for help, and the family used a boat to pull him out from the reeds not far away. His limbs were limp like cotton. He had already died. Cries of mourning arose, a truly tragic sight. It is said that Ada's wife is only 27 years old, has no sons, and has three daughters. The family is not wealthy and depends on Ada to support them. Now he has lost his life over a pig feed jar, pitiable and lamentable.</p>

<h3>A Feud Arising from Harassment of a Woman Leads to a Violent Gang Fight</h3>
<p>Chinese Police Open Fire to Disperse the Crowd; One Man Injured and Accomplices Arrested</p>
<p>Ji Jinming from Tongzhou has been cohabitating with Wang Yuedi, an 18-year-old woman from Wuxi, near 340 Baoding Road. A ruffian named Chen Jianfeng often harassed Wang Yuedi, stalking and making lewd jokes, which was discovered by Ji. When Ji reasoned with Chen, Chen insulted him. At 10:15 PM the night before last, both sides gathered dozens of thugs and engaged in a major brawl on Kunming Road, firing guns. Police officers No. 2620, No. 2609, and No. 2998 from the Huishan Police Station rushed to the scene upon hearing the report and opened fire as a warning, causing the crowd to scatter like birds and beasts. As a result, Xu Awu from Jiangyin was arrested. A wooden stick, a bullet, and two shell casings were found on the ground. Wang Jiaquan, a Tongzhou native, was found ax-wounded in the Dexing Physical Education Center at 331 Tonglu, together with Ji Jinming. After questioning, the cause of the fight was learned. Qian Xiaomao, a local, and his brother Chen Caida, accomplices of Chen Jianfeng, and Wang Ruitang, from Jiangyin, Liu Xingye, from Qingkou, and Zhang Cheng, from Anhui, accomplices of Ji Jinming, were arrested, along with the woman Wang Yuedi, who was arrested at 340 Baoding Road. All were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court.

<h3>Dalong Factory's Self-Made Textile Machine</h3>
<p>Extremely Noteworthy to Foreigners</p>
<p>The Dalong Iron Factory has been established for 36 years, specializing in textile machinery. At the Municipal Government's 10th Anniversary Industrial Exhibition, Dalong also displayed its self-made textile machine. The structure is exquisite, and the operation is accurate. Compared to imported goods, it is not inferior in any way. Furthermore, the entire process from self-made spinning to finished cloth demonstrates innovation and is captivating. Smith, the head of the Ewo Yarns Factory, also visited yesterday and carefully examined each machine, paying close attention. It is truly unexpected that China's Dalong Factory has such excellent products. This proves that Dalong's various products can indeed compete with those of Europe and America, and it can dispel the long-standing prejudice of foreigners against China as an industrially backward country.</p>

<h3>Verdict in Fu Wenhao's Home Robbery Case to Be Announced Tomorrow</h3>
<p>In the case of Fu Wenhao, a Sichuan native (the protagonist of "Old Well Heavy Wave"), a former famous socialite and actress living at 72 Yaliangbei Road in the French Concession, who was robbed of clothing and cash totaling over 4,000 yuan by a tenant in her attic room on July 21 of last year, who claimed to be a student of political science and law, after reporting the incident to the police, it was not until the beginning of this month that the female tenant Cheng Tiantian was mistakenly stepped on by a young man from Guangdong named Lin Fuyao in front of the Paris Grand Theatre on Avenue Joffre, leading to a misunderstanding and quarrel. After Lin apologized verbally and dispersed, Lin went to urinate in the Hehefang alley. Cheng Tiantian, accompanied by her brother Cheng Jingfa, followed him and apprehended him, accusing Lin of being the robber in the Fu Wenhao home robbery case. They took him to the police station, who transferred him to the Second Special Court, where he was prosecuted according to law. The plaintiff Fu Wenhao entrusted lawyer Wen Chao to act as her agent and filed an ancillary civil lawsuit, requesting recovery of the stolen goods worth over 4,000 yuan. However, the defendant Lin Chuanyao denied being the robber during the trial, stating that on the day of the robbery, he was staying at the home of Bai Wenwei, a member of the Central Committee in Nanjing, and requested that the Bai residence be investigated. The court sent a letter to the Nanjing court for investigation during the rescheduled hearing. According to the reply, Lin did indeed stay there. However, Fu Wenhao firmly insisted that the defendant was the robber. Presiding Judge Chen Shuoying, tireless in seeking details, repeatedly held hearings to investigate all aspects, which have been reported extensively in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, another hearing was held to continue the trial. The judge summoned the parties and witnesses to question them again and ordered final arguments. The police and the defendant's defense lawyer, Ma Lewu, engaged in mutual arguments, after which the court announced the end of the arguments and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 16 AM on the morning of the 16th.</p>
<h3>Suzhou House Selling Scam Five or Six Years Ago</h3>
<p>Rent Uncollectible After Paying for the House; Chance Encounter with the Con Man Leads to Arrest and Prosecution</p>
<p>Cao Zhiji, a Ningbo native and manager of China Huacheng Tobacco Company, 50 years old, met Pan Luhe (31 years old this year), a Suzhou native, at a friend's banquet in a brothel before 1936. At the time, Pan impersonated a member of the Pan clan, a prominent family in Suzhou. Cao believed him and frequented his company, gradually becoming close friends. Later, Pan falsely claimed to have real estate in Suzhou in a certain location and intended to sell it. Cao, who was planning to buy property in Suzhou, heard that Pan had property for sale and readily agreed, willing to pay a good price. Pan then arranged for Cao to go to Suzhou to inspect the property. After agreeing on a price of over 30,000 yuan, they came to Shanghai together, booked a room at the Far Eastern Hotel, and signed a sales contract. After paying the contract price, Cao went to Suzhou a month later to collect rent from the existing tenants, but they all refused, stating that the property had never been sold. Only then did Cao realize he had been deceived. He searched for Pan Luhe in Suzhou and Shanghai to reason with him, but to no avail, and the matter dragged on for five or six years. Unexpectedly, as the saying goes, "One may search far and wide, but the answer is right under one's nose." For the past five or six years, Cao had been searching for Pan's whereabouts daily. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, at about 5 PM, Cao happened to meet Pan Luhe face to face at the intersection of the West Water and Fire Street on Avenue Edward VII. He immediately grabbed Pan, called the police, and took him to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for interrogation. Judge Chen Shuoying reviewed the case with the police lawyer Chen Ming, requesting a postponement of the investigation. The plaintiff Cao Zhiqing (who walks with a cane because his left foot was run over by a streetcar) also appeared in court to describe the entire process of being deceived by the defendant. The court questioned the defendant and scheduled another hearing for the 20th. The defendant was remanded into custody.</p>
<h3>Wife Wants to Work in a Factory, Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium</h3>
<p>Li Changgen (46 years old), a visitor from elsewhere, lives at No. 8, Yuhou Lane, Xuegong Street, near the People's Education Center inside the Old West Gate, and his wife, Zhu (28 years old), were initially deeply in love. However, in recent years, Li Changgen lost his job, and the family was destitute. Therefore, Zhu wanted to work in a factory, but Li Changgen was stubborn and believed that if his wife entered a factory, she would be influenced by the environment and become infatuated, leading to a change of heart. Therefore, he forbade his wife from working. However, Zhu felt that rather than starve to death, she would rather find another way to survive. Li Changgen was both saddened and angered, and at 1 PM the day before yesterday, he swallowed opium and committed suicide. No one knew at the time, and he became a wronged spirit. When the roommate found out, he reported it to the Wenmiao Road Police Station. In addition to detaining and questioning Zhu, the local bailiff Jiang Pingyang was ordered yesterday to report to the local court for examination. The assigned Prosecutor Wang and others arrived at the scene to examine the body and confirmed that the death was due to poisoning. They ordered the body to be collected and await further review.</p>
<h3>Taxi Driver Cui Jiajun Sued by Mistress for Abduction</h3>
<p>Cui Jiajun, a Yancheng native and driver for Xiang Sheng Taxi Company (27 years old), already had a wife at home. However, he liked to philander, and four years ago, he met Xu Jinmei (currently 22 years old), a woman from Pudong, by chance and fell in love with her. They cohabitated, and the taxi driver actually enjoyed the blessings of two wives. Unexpectedly, the beautiful scene did not last. Xu Jinmei had a falling out with him and hired a lawyer to sue Cui in local court for seduction and abuse, stating that the plaintiff was promised marriage by the defendant Cui Jiajun in 1933, seduced, and then sexually assaulted. They lived at No. 1, Lane 147, Tiantong Road, for four years. Although she had repeatedly urged him, he had not held a wedding ceremony. However, the defendant was associated with hoodlums and often extorted money and pawned clothing from the plaintiff for his own extravagance. Recently, seeing that the plaintiff's savings were exhausted, his attitude suddenly changed. If she slightly displeased him, he would resort to violence. On the night of June 26 of this year, the defendant again became angry when his demands for money from the plaintiff were not met and locked the door, physically assaulting the plaintiff. The next day, he held a hard piece of wood as a weapon and wanted to beat her again. The plaintiff, fearing for her life, had no choice but to escape through the back door and take refuge with relatives. She requested that he be punished under Article 298 of the Criminal Law. At the hearing yesterday, Judge Bai, the plaintiff Xu Jinmei stated, "I originally had a fiancé. I worked behind Huanlong Road, and he would park his taxi there every day and often flirt with me, and I got to know him. He lied to me that he didn't have a wife, so we had a relationship. Later, after moving to his house, I found out that he already had a wife. But it had already come to this, so I had no choice but to cohabitate. Unexpectedly, he used the money I earned and used it. The other day, because he wanted to ask me for my ring, and I refused, he beat me," etc. Cui Jiajun stated, "I have a wife, and she is my mistress of four years. She lives with my parents and wife and has not been abused. What she said is a lie." After hearing the arguments, the court concluded the trial and will announce the verdict on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Grave Robbing Defendant Feels Sentence Too Light; Original Plaintiff Files Appeal</h3>
<p>The ancestral grave of Shi Qixiang, a local gentleman from Tieyi, Caohejing, Shanghai West, was previously dug up by Shi Baisheng from the same clan, in collusion with Yi Haiyun, Xu Wennan, and others, who privately exhumed the remains and sold the bricks. After repeated investigations by the court, they were found guilty, and Shi Baisheng was sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment, while Yi and Xu were each sentenced to one year imprisonment. They are currently awaiting execution. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the plaintiff, based on the law, believes the sentence is too lenient and has filed an appeal with the original court prosecutor, stating that the deceased ancestor in the case is a direct senior relative of the plaintiff and also a direct blood relative of the defendants. According to Article 249, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, the crime carries a sentence of imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than seven years. Furthermore, Article 250 of the same law stipulates that if the crime is committed against a direct blood senior relative, the sentence should be increased by one-half. Additionally, Article 56 of the same law stipulates that if multiple actions constitute the same crime, the sentence may also be increased by one-half. However, the Criminal Court of Your esteemed court only sentenced the defendant to the minimum of two years and six months imprisonment, which is considered too lenient in light of the circumstances. Even the one-year imprisonment imposed on Yi Haiyun and Xu Wennan is considered insufficient, etc. (omitted below)</p>

<h3>Forced to Sign Contract Allowing Concubine; Xu Xuetang Assaults Wife</h3>
<p>Ignoring Fifteen Years of Marital Relationship; Police Prosecution Fines Fifty Dollars</p>
<p>Xu Xuetang, a native of Ningbo and the 33-year-old factory director of the Wei Yi Wool Textile Factory located at 769 Niuzhuang Road, was apprenticed to the Wansheng Chang Foreign Goods Store established by Li Yongyang on Nanxun Road in his youth. Because of his excellent performance, he gained Li Yongyang's trust, who believed that Xu had great potential and betrothed his daughter Xiuyun (now 35 years old) to Xu. They were married fifteen years ago. Xu then left Wansheng Chang and founded the Wei Yi Textile Factory, from which he prospered. The Wei Yi factory is located on Zhoujiazui Road, while Niuzhuang Road serves as the wholesale office. Xu and Li Xiuyun also resided in the wholesale office. For fifteen years, the couple lived harmoniously and peacefully, and had three sons and one daughter. However, recently, Xu began to frequent prostitutes and became entangled with Xuehua Laoer, a prostitute in Huiyao Lane. He now intends to take the prostitute as a concubine and live with her and Li. He immediately discussed this with Li, who refused. On the 20th of last month, at around 1:00 AM, Xu suddenly forced Li to sign a contract allowing him to take a concubine. When Li firmly refused, Xu became enraged and severely beat her. Around 3:00 AM, he again assaulted her. Li sustained injuries to her chest, arms, and other parts of her body. She reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station. Hua Kongmu Lang Jintang and Detective Zhang Keqin investigated the case and sent Li to Guangren Hospital for examination, which confirmed her injuries. Li then, accompanied by lawyer Liang Bohua, went to Guangren Hospital for another examination, and the hospital issued an injury certificate. The police station immediately requested a summons from the Special First Court. Xu Xuetang was summoned to the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning, where the case was tried by clerk Zhan Fengqi. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the case and prosecuted Xu for the crime of assault under Article 277 of the Criminal Law. Li Xiuyun then recounted the details of the assault and presented a photograph of the defendant and Xuehua Laoer as evidence. When questioned, Xu Xuetang confessed that the incident was caused by Li's gambling habit, as she did not return home until 3:00 AM that night. He questioned her, which led to the conflict, but he denied injuring her. He also attacked Li for forming sworn sisterhoods, and for worshiping "old men." He hired Fan Gang as his defense lawyer. After reviewing the testimonies, clerk Zhan sentenced Xu Xuetang to a fine of fifty dollars for injuring another person.</p>
<h3>Chen Xuehai and Others Request Authorities Ban Short Selling of Government Bonds</h3>
<p>Requesting Immediate Dispatch of Personnel for Thorough Investigation and Ordering Short Sellers to Submit Actual Goods</p>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports that Chen Xuehai, Hong Ziliang, Feng Langxian, Lu Fangkun, and others telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan in Lushan, Xu and Du, the two Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, and Wu, Minister of the Ministry of Industry, requesting the maintenance of the credibility of government bonds. The original text reads: "Since the Lugouqiao Incident, unified government bonds have experienced an unprecedented decline, repeatedly hitting the limit. The situation is turbulent and unsustainable. As a result, the financial community has suffered immense damage. It is evident that unscrupulous merchants are manipulating the market and engaging in short selling. If swift measures are not taken to ban this practice, the entire financial system may be irreparably damaged. Therefore, we urgently appeal to Your esteemed office to dispatch personnel for a thorough investigation immediately and, as in previous cases, order short sellers to submit actual goods in order to maintain the credibility of national bonds and safeguard the economic lifeline."</p>

While walking near the entrance of Dasheng Lane, a bag containing 5,000 yuan was snatched by three robbers. The Yimiao Police Station, which had jurisdiction over the area, received a tip that Fan Yongshan (45 years old), a native of Anhui residing at 18 Yinji Road, Xiexu Road, was involved in the robbery. Detectives were dispatched to arrest Fan at his address. However, during questioning, Fan denied any knowledge of the crime. At the time, Fan's neighbors and nearby shops jointly provided bail, proving that Fan Yongshan was a legitimate merchant, that Fan was nearing his 50s and had a beard, and that he did not resemble a robber. After investigation, it was determined that he had been framed by enemies. He has been granted bail.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Quarrels with Manager, Attempts Suicide by Swallowing Poison</h3>
<p>Zhao Junsheng, an 18-year-old apprentice from the Yueji Leather Shop at No. 1 Nantongqing Lane, Xiaobeimen, Minguo Road, got into an argument with manager Zhao Qingkai the other day about a towel for washing his face. As an apprentice, he was naturally beaten by the manager. The apprentice then went out to buy groceries and, upon returning, swallowed "insecticide" used to protect cowhide in attempt to commit suicide. When colleague Zhang Zhenbi discovered this, he immediately sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died. The body was sent to the concession autopsy center, but the Laobeimen Police Station, which had jurisdiction over the area since the incident occurred in the Chinese area, instructed Baojia Jiang Pingyang to report to the local court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Chen and examiners were commissioned to conduct an autopsy and ordered the body to be collected pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Indecent Assault Defendant Appeals Original Verdict</h3>
<p>The rogue Li A'gen, on the day of King George VI's coronation on May 12 of this year, took advantage of the overcrowded conditions near the Yu Qiaqing Road Xiaoyao Ballroom to drag Chen Feifei, a woman traveling in a rickshaw, out of the rickshaw. He tore off Chen's clothes completely and injured her genitals and buttocks with his hands. At the same time, Chen's wallet was also stolen. Chen immediately cried for help, and Li was arrested and handed over to the Special First Court, which sentenced him to five years imprisonment. Li appealed the verdict to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday morning, criminal judge Shan Yuhua, along with judges Xiao and Nie, presided over the hearing in the First Criminal Court. Li vehemently protested his innocence and requested that the original verdict be overturned and that he be declared not guilty. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu argued that Li's actions were extremely vile and that the original trial had been lenient by not prosecuting him for robbery and forcible indecency. Therefore, the appellant's appeal was without merit and should be rejected. Prosecutor Lin Woming also determined that Li's actions were unforgivable. Judge Yu then declared the hearing closed and scheduled a date for the verdict to be announced.</p>

<h3>Ye Guangbei Grape Wine Shipped to Shanghai for Sale</h3>
<p>In order to promote rural industry and develop the national economy, the Xiaoxian County Government has been using the county's surplus grapes to produce grape wine and brandy for many years. The wine was shipped to Beijing for sale during the National Handicraft Products Exhibition last month and was praised throughout the capital in one month. According to factory director Wang Xueqin, the county uses fresh, pure juice extracted from the county's abundant grapes, hires agricultural product manufacturing experts, and uses scientific equipment for processing and brewing. It has been chemically tested by academic and health organizations and found to be of excellent quality, far superior to imported products. However, during the initial sales period, in order to promote the widespread recognition of domestic grape wine by the Chinese people and to capture the market and curb outflow, although the quality is far superior to imported products, the selling price is less than one-fourth of theirs. However, due to cost considerations, it must be slightly higher than the chemically produced fake wine mixed with impurities sold on the market. In order to actively promote sales, the factory has established a Shanghai office at No. 44 Yongping Lane, Maigen Road.</p>

<h3>Mr. Huang Yingbai and "Greater Shanghai" (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jiu Zhai</p>
<p>Mr. Huang was a deeply thoughtful and far-sighted statesman. His patriotism was more fervent than ordinary people, and his concern for the country was deeper and more far-reaching. He recognized the facts, did not sing empty high-sounding tunes, and strived to overcome difficulties with his own strength. This was Mr. Huang's consistent spirit throughout his life. His purpose in building Greater Shanghai gave us concrete proof. We praise Mr. Huang's Greater Shanghai plan, and we should not forget his intention and spirit. As for the municipal government organization established by Mr. Huang, what is particularly worth mentioning is the adoption of the spirit of the American manager system, and the implementation of the bureau-level administration system. The bureau-level administration system has now been promoted throughout the country. Everyone believes that it is sufficient to select talents and fully give them the benefit of administrative power, without interfering with the mayor's progress or retreat. However, at that time, it may not have been understood by the general public. The press often thought that the scale was too large and the cost was too high, and expressed expectations. However, Mr. Yingbai resolutely resisted public opinion and resolutely implemented it. In his conversation with the second mayor, Mr. Zhang Boxuan, he once said, "When we legislate and implement policies, we will exhaust our wisdom to decide on them, then we will be brave enough to go to them, and finally we will persevere to complete them. If we do what is right, what can we do with floating words? There will be facts as the answer in the future.” Yes, there are already good facts as answers now.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Yingbai's spirit of impartiality in using people and identifying true talents at that time, it is best for us to objectively cite the narratives of those who experienced it personally to replace the explanation. Mr. Huang Boqiao said, "The bureaus of the Shanghai Special Municipality were all newly created. The mayor never recommended a single person from the secretary department head down to hundreds of employees. Each bureau chief was fully authorized to select employees. My public utility bureau was like this, and so were other bureaus. This was true for bureau chiefs who had been with the gentleman for many years, and also for those who had just met him." In his article "Thinking of Mr. Yingbai When I First Met Him," Mr. Pan Gongzhan said, "I was moved by him and unconsciously offered to say, "I am willing to draft an organizational outline for Mr. Huang's Bureau of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, and at the same time write a plan for handling labor administration, as a contribution to Mr. Huang's creation of my country's first special municipality.” He also smiled and encouraged me to draft it, so I said goodbye to him and started writing to fulfill this promise. However, I didn’t expect that Mr. Yingbai would later be ordered to serve as the mayor one day, and entrusted me, who had no administrative experience and had no deep friendship with him, to take charge of the affairs of the Bureau of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce..."</p>
<p>Finally, let us quote Mr. Shen Chang’s words to prove Mr. Yingbai’s hard work and precision in handling affairs at that time. Mr. Shen said, “I have known Mr. Huang for eight years... and those who were his colleagues were only in the Shanghai Municipal Government, for less than three months. Mr. Huang was busy with government affairs, with no time to spare, and I was a subordinate, but he would personally read and approve the official documents I drafted, and even point out the errors in the copy of a word, and told me, "To handle a case, you must first carefully read the old documents to understand its origin and end; to draft a manuscript, you must be complete from beginning to end, with clear and thorough regulations...”</p>
<p>The above briefly describes Mr. Huang Yingbai’s creations and administration when he was the mayor of Shanghai, but it only lists a few things, and there are many omissions, but this alone is worthy of our commemoration and admiration. (The above-quoted statements from various sources, except for Mr. Huang’s own speeches, are all taken from "Remembrances of Old Friends of Mr. Huang Yingbai" (The End)</p>

<h3>A Word for the Patriotic Chinese with Blood in Their Veins</h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>What makes a human a human is the blood coursing through their veins. Without that blood, we are merely walking corpses, no longer deserving the name of human.</p>
<p>I ask myself, and I ask the people of this nation: Do we have blood in our veins? Can we truly call ourselves human? When they broke one of our legs, we bore the pain, content to hobble along on crutches. When they twisted one of our arms, we endured the suffering, content to bandage it up and move on. We have always swallowed our pride, yielded ground step by step. Where is the blood in that? Where is the humanity?</p>
<p>And so they come again, extending their iron-fisted hands to grasp our throats, to end our very lives. We have reached the precipice of life and death; there is no more ground to yield, no more suffering to endure.</p>
<p>Hear me, patriotic Chinese with blood in your veins! Lugou Bridge is not only the tomb of a contingent of the Twenty-Ninth Army; it is the tomb of the entire Chinese nation. We must defend Lugou Bridge with iron and blood; we must defend all of China with iron and blood.</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Pioneer Shen Xingchu</h3>
<p>— Chen Jianxia</p>
<p>Ever since Dr. Sun Yat-sen founded the Revive China Society, its revolutionary comrades secretly spread propaganda and worked to connect with one another. Though my hometown was but a small township, its enlightened citizens were active participants in the movement, and my teacher, Mr. Shen Xingchu, stood out among them. He had been inculcating revolutionary ideals since the last years of the Guangxu reign. As the Qing court first proposed abolishing the imperial examination system, Mr. Shen, though a graduate of the Imperial Academy, took the lead in establishing schools and promoting modern learning. He cut off his queue long before it became fashionable. The social atmosphere was extremely restrictive at the time, and people met his actions with mockery, but Mr. Shen paid them no mind. Whenever the school held gatherings, Mr. Shen would seize the opportunity to take the stage and deliver speeches promoting his revolutionary cause, making the overthrow of the Qing dynasty his mission. His words flowed like a river, without any regard for the consequences, and listeners were deeply moved. Mr. Shen had a limp in one leg, yet he moved with incredible speed, traveling between Shanghai and Hangzhou, befriending local comrades in order to carry out his long-held beliefs. Among those who associated with him at the time were Ye Chucang, Chen Taoyi, and Chu Fucheng, all stalwarts of the revolutionary alliance. Mr. Shen's eloquence and literary talent were especially admired by his peers. Mr. Shen's nickname was Shouping, and when someone asked him what it meant, he replied, "Don't you know that I have a limp? Those with a limp walk with unsteady steps, and it is difficult to hold a bottle steady. I wish to steadfastly guard my bottle, so that it will not break even if it is knocked over!" Those who heard it burst into laughter. Such was his sense of humor. Later, he served as director of local administration, but was resented by the ignorant populace over a trivial matter. They not only destroyed the school he had founded, but also surrounded and brutally murdered him in front of the county government office. Under the Qing legal system, the punishment for mass killings could not be reduced. Therefore, the perpetrators were not brought to justice until after the revolution. Mr. Shen, however, did not live to see the realization of the revolution, and must have carried his resentment with him to the afterlife! I imagine that among the officials in the current national government there must be no small number of Mr. Shen's old acquaintances. As they read this article, I wonder if they can still recall his life and attest to the truth of my words!</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhijiang Gets Up Early</h3>
<p>— Xuewen</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhijiang is currently in Nanjing. In addition to serving as the director of the Central Guoshu Institute, he also runs a National Physical Education School, where he serves as the principal. The school is located at the foot of Zijin Mountain, in a tranquil and picturesque environment. The school buildings and facilities are also quite "good," and there are plans for further expansion.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Zhang is an elder statesman, his physical strength and spirited expression are not inferior to those of strong young men. As long as you see his loud voice and lively gestures when he lectures, you can't help but admire his spirit of "getting stronger as you get older"!</p>
<p>No one who has heard him speak doesn't laugh. His tone is always so humorous, and he stretches his fists and bends his palms. Someone said, "Mr. Zhang is also boxing while he is lecturing"!</p>
<p>He gets up very early every day, reportedly at four o'clock in the morning, and practices boxing outside. Sometimes the students haven't gotten out of bed yet, and he's already in the car.</p>
<h3>Replacing the Nest, Luan and Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 15 (News Inquires in the Southern City, Yun Chuang Speaks of Dreams, Elegant Farewell from the Seat, Return Carriage from the Brothel Alley)</p>
<p>Madam Zhang said: "Is there any mother who doesn't love her own son? Especially since my situation is quite different from others." Youmei nodded and said, "Auntie is right. But if cousin is so uncomfortable, we can't let him go on like this, can we?" Madam Zhang said: "That's true. I plan to ask him for details when he wakes up today. Liu Ma, go see if the young master is awake yet. Just say we have a guest." Youmei stood up, shook both hands with Madam Zhang, and smiled: "If cousin is still drunk and hasn't woken up, let him rest a little longer." Madam Zhang laughed and said: "Miss Li, you are very clever. You're afraid I'll scold him in front of you, which would be too embarrassing for him. Of course, I will also save him some face and not talk about him in front of guests. It's a pity he doesn't have an old friend like you, who is often around." Youmei lowered her eyelids, looked at the copper brazier under the old lady's feet, bit her lower lip, and pondered for a while. Then she smiled and said: "Cousin also has several like-minded friends in literature, right?" Madam Zhang didn't mind her demeanor and replied: "He wouldn't. If he did, he would definitely tell that like-minded friend about his troubles and ask him to find a solution. Don't think that just because he's unwilling to tell his mother, he's unwilling to tell his friends. Those are two different things. Telling me will not only fail to alleviate his worries, but may also cause me to worry along with him. As for like-minded friends, that's not the case. Even if they can't think of an idea, they won't be too anxious for their friend." Youmei took a lidded bowl of tea from the tea table, held it with both hands, took a sip, and slowly put it down. She smiled and said: "Perhaps his like-minded friends can't think of a solution either." Madam Zhang said: "Of course, he's not stupid. Just because he doesn't have a solution doesn't mean someone else will. It's just that a good friend, seeing him in this dissolute state, would definitely try to persuade him. He doesn't have anyone to advise him now, because he doesn't have any good friends." Youmei nodded: "Yes, generally speaking, cousin has become so dissolute… Ah! I'm just talking nonsense. Actually, I haven't seen him do anything terrible, so how can I say he's dissolute? Getting drunk after drinking a few cups of wine is common for scholars." Madam Zhang, hearing her words, also smiled slightly: It seemed the old lady had suddenly discovered something and was about to examine it, scrutinizing Youmei from head to toe. Youmei, seeing the old lady scrutinizing her for no reason, didn't understand the reason for her observation. She lowered her head, smiling slightly, but two patches of peach-colored blush flew onto her cheeks. She looked at the ground and drew with her toe on the floor. (196)</p>
<h3>National Hero "Three Rivers Good"</h3>
<p>— Ze Cheng</p>
<p>Some people have become famous through newspaper publicity, making them known to everyone. But there are also heroes who have been buried because they are not good at publicity. Here, I would like to introduce a not-so-famous national hero, "Three Rivers Good," whose real name is Luo Mingxing.</p>
<p>Luo is from Fan County, Shandong Province. His hometown is near Liangshan. Is it possible that he received the endowment that the so-called Yan and Zhao region has many generous and tragic heroes? When he was fourteen or fifteen years old, his hometown suffered a famine, so he went outside the border to make a living, and then joined Zhang Zuoxiang's army as a soldier. By 1929, he was already a battalion commander. After the "September 18th" Incident, anyone with a bit of spirit couldn't stand the trampling of iron hooves and rose up to shout and resist. Luo then led his troops and raised the banner of revolt. Soon, many people responded to him. This would certainly provoke the hatred of traitors and enemies, so they mobilized a large army to suppress him. His resistance was really strong. It is said that he experienced more than fifty battles. Although he sometimes lost, his troops made the enemy and traitor armies exhausted.</p>
<p>Last year, he was seriously injured and returned to the country. On the one hand, it was for treatment, and on the other hand, to see the domestic situation. At that time, I was working as an editor at a newspaper in Shandong. Through a friend's introduction, I met this national hero. His quick wit and strong physique really made you shout, "His reputation is well-deserved!" Later, we became very good friends. Once, he cried and said to me, "Mr. ×: I have been inside the border for almost a year. Although I always think about my brothers outside the border, I can't do anything. In Nanjing and Beiping, I have met many military and political leaders, and I have also met many anti-Japanese predecessors in Shanghai, such as Li Du and Wang Delin, but… but…" Luo was choked with sobs.</p>
<p>Once, he suddenly ran to my house very happily and told me: "In five days, I will go to Xi'an to meet with Young Marshal Zhang and a few friends from the Northeast Army. I will probably be back in half a month, but I will not come here. I may go directly outside the border. I am here to say goodbye now. I hope we will meet again soon in the recovered lost territories." Hearing this, I was sad, but also happy.</p>
<p>However, things rarely go as planned. On the third day of his speech, news of the Xi'an Incident reached Shandong. Luo took a large roll of newspapers and found me at home, saying bluntly, "I didn't expect Young Marshal Zhang to cause such a stir. It's all over! Please draft a telegram for Zhang. Perhaps it may have some effect…" I was equally indignant, so I quickly picked up a pen to write. At this time, I asked him what to say. He replied very simply: "Tell Young Marshal Zhang: You have already thrown 30 million people in Guandong into the fire. Can you bear to throw 400 million people across the country into the fire?" What powerful tone was that! So I drafted the manuscript according to this meaning and sent it.</p>
<p>Soon after, I left Shandong. Two weeks ago, I received a letter from Luo from the Northeast, and I knew that he had gone outside the border again. In my heart, I will never forget this person. Yes, this is a national hero worthy of admiration, this is a real man who can stand up!</p>
<h3>Lin Zexu's Views on Foot Binding</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>A few days ago, I went to visit my friend Min Jun's relatives on business. At that time, Min Jun was drying books in the courtyard, among which were two exquisitely decorated volumes, titled "Lai Hong Ji," which were the letters left by his ancestors of three or four generations. Min Jun's family has been scholarly for generations, and his great-grandfathers for three generations all worked as private secretaries, so in his "Lai Hong Ji," the manuscripts of famous figures of the Qing Dynasty accounted for three or four tenths.</p>
<p>According to my friend, he had a glimpse of the outline of them six or seven years ago. One of the letters was from Lin Zexu to Min Jun's maternal grandfather. It is said that Min Jun's maternal grandfather happened to be working as a private secretary at Lin's place during the Opium War and was highly valued by Lin. Later, Lin was demoted, so he left to go elsewhere. The letter was written by Lin to his maternal grandfather during his demoted life after the Opium War, discussing women's foot-binding at length. The whole letter was more than 5,000 words long, written on extremely rough mulberry paper, in a cursive Ouyang style, but with three parts Liu style bones.</p>
<p>Although my friend was unable to see the whole picture at the time, he had secretly memorized one or two of Lin's views on foot-binding. The first paragraph stated that there must be mothers with natural feet in order to have tall and strong sons. Although it did not explicitly say that the demise of the Ming Dynasty was due to the Manchus not binding their feet, thus having strong warriors, this meaning was already clearly on the paper in the words and lines. Then, it went on to describe how the Jiangzhe soldiers were afraid of fighting to the death during the Opium War, and blamed it on the small feet of the defending generals' mothers, saying that the sons born from mothers who swayed with every step could not be entrusted with the important task of defending the country. Following this, the letter used the Japanese pirates as an example, saying that the Ming Dynasty's inability to invade the country was due to the resistance of farmers everywhere, and that the farmers were rarely born from mothers with bound feet, so they were so brave and unafraid of death.</p>
<p>Such remarks, when viewed today, naturally seem a bit strange, but seventy or eighty years ago, Duke Lin had already seen the need to reform the practice of foot-binding, and his outstanding vision was very admirable.</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin's Frugal Life</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>Among the important figures of the current National Government, we know that there are two with beautiful beards, one is the President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, and the other is our Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen. Although Chairman Lin is already in his seventies, his spirit is still very vigorous. The foot-long silver beard reflects his half-bald forehead, further enhancing his gentle and kind attitude. So fluttering, he really has the air of a divine immortal with crane hair and childlike face!</p>
<p>He was originally from Minhou, Fujian. In his early years, for the sake of revolution, he followed the late Premier, running north and south throughout his life. He has had few opportunities to return to his hometown. However, he has been to the islands of the South Seas several times, and the overseas Chinese in the South Seas have a deep faith in him. Even six or seven years ago, when he was elected as the successor Chairman of the National Government, he was still inspecting overseas Chinese affairs in the South Seas.</p>
<p>However, he is able to maintain such a strong physique at such an advanced age entirely due to his regular and cultivated daily life. Naturally, rich nutrition is also a major reason. For example, he drinks a cup of young chicken juice every day, which has never been interrupted for decades, because he often says: The effect of young chicken juice is great. The effect of one cup of young chicken juice is at least better than ten doses of ordinary tonics. He also firmly believes in traditional Chinese medicine, saying that it is the quintessence of the country and should be protected and improved. When the Chinese and Western medical circles were fighting a trend a few years ago, he and legislator Jiao Yitang did their best to protect Chinese medicine, so that Chinese medicine could be preserved.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the weather is cold or warm, he always gets up very early every day. After getting up, he drinks a cup of young chicken juice, then goes out for a walk to breathe fresh air. Whether he is at home or abroad, he is very fond of simplicity and cleanliness: Sometimes he wears a cloth robe, puts on a pair of cloth shoes, and strolls leisurely. I believe that if people who don't know him see him, they will definitely not know that he is the current Chairman of the National Government, but will think that he is an old scholar!</p>
<p>People say that he is a people-oriented chairman. It's really not an exaggeration, because not only are his clothes simple, but his daily life is even more frugal. His words and deeds are especially worthy of our admiration. Logically speaking, he is the highest head of the National Government, and his life, whether it be in terms of clothing, food, shelter, and transportation, should be very luxurious. But in fact, his life is not even as comfortable as that of a bureau chief or section chief.</p>
<p>Chairman Lin also has a private residence in Shanghai, which is in an alley on Jin Shenfu Road. It is a three-story Cantonese-style building with a monthly rent of only fifty or sixty yuan: Compared to the fact that an average person's garage could occupy three or four tenths of a floor, there is a vast difference. As for his official residence as Chairman of the National Government in Nanjing, that is naturally an exception.</p>
<p>When he is in Shanghai, if he occasionally goes out, he does not have his own car. Even if he is going to visit friends far away or has something to do, he calls an hourly car from a nearby car rental company.</p>
<p>He currently does not have a wife, and his sons and daughters-in-law are not by his side. In this mansion in Shanghai, there is only a cook couple in their forties who also take on the job of guarding the house.</p>
<p>In addition, the chairman also loves antiques and calligraphy and paintings. Now, in his mansion, there are many ancient books, antiques, and other curiosities. He himself has told people that he has a strong ability to identify antiques. Whether it is the Book of Han or the Book of Tang, as long as he identifies them, the authenticity can be immediately distinguished. When he arrives in Shanghai, he always likes to walk alone to the City God Temple in his spare time, pick up old books at the old book stalls, or look at curiosities in the antique shops, so he has almost become a regular customer of the antique shops in the City God Temple. Naturally, everyone recognizes him as the Chairman of the National Government, so they often raise the prices higher, but his bargaining skills are also quite good. After the price is negotiated and the goods are checked, he orders someone from the shop to send them, but he strolls home across the Nine-Turn Bridge and only pays when the boy delivers the goods.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if his clothes are a little damaged, he asks someone to repair them before wearing them again. And he often tells young people: "Our country has become so poor, we can only save a little to cultivate national strength…"</p>
<p>Now, he has served as Chairman of the National Government for the third term. Several times when he was elected, he repeatedly tried to humbly decline, but all parties believed that he was old and respected, and there was really no one more suitable than him, so in the end, he was still made the Chairman of the National Government this time.</p>

<h3>Oath</h3>
<p>— Wu Cun</p>
<p>To gain people's trust in doing things, the best way is naturally to prove it with facts. But this requires really doing it, which is very laborious. A simpler method is to swear an oath, using a few passionate and bloody words to express one's feelings.</p>
<p>Village women love to curse people, and they are also good at swearing oaths. When arguing with someone, if there is something to explain, they raise one hand to the sky, point their finger, and say: "Heaven is above, if this matter is like this, I will surely be struck by lightning; otherwise, those who wrong me will not have a good death!"</p>
<p>But the blue sky has nothing to do with people. It never cares about right and wrong in the world. Once the oath is sworn, the matter is over.</p>
<p>The listeners also listen and forget. They will never believe it.</p>
<p>Modern men and women in love, after hugging and kissing in private, say: "My love, we must love each other forever, until the seas run dry and the rocks crumble, and the heavens collapse and the earth splits!" This is called "solemn vows." But the seas don't run dry, the rocks don't crumble, and when the excitement is over, everyone can break up and find another object to love and swear oaths to.</p>
<p>I once read in some notebook, probably written by a former Qing Dynasty loyalist, a story like this:</p>
<p>It is said that a wealthy young man was infatuated with a prostitute. The young master was determined to marry her, and the girl could not live without marrying him. The young master made up his mind and went home to "negotiate," asking his father to fulfill their marriage. Before leaving, they swore oaths to each other, and the woman even asked for an object from his body as a token. As a result, he painfully sacrificed and knocked out a tooth. Who knew that after returning home, the old master firmly refused, saying that prostitutes would not have true love, and that he might as well pretend to be poor and see how she treated him. So the young master obeyed, not shaving for three months and not washing for ten months. After making himself look embarrassed, he went to see his mistress. As a result, the prostitute ignored him. The young master was so angry that he trembled and wanted to get back the tooth he had knocked out himself. Okay, if you want it back, here it is. The prostitute brought it out. There were so many teeth in the box. She said, "That one is yours. Find it yourself."</p>
<p>This article is probably to advise people not to talk about love with prostitutes, or even to advise people not to visit brothels. But from this we can know that there are actually people in the world who make swearing oaths their profession.</p>
<p>In recent years, as I have gained more experience in life, I have less and less respect for those passionate oaths. What "swear to resist the enemy to the death," what "swear not to make a treaty under the city," it really makes the people feel cool all over, feeling that our nation is about to be saved. Unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, the oath-taker is smiling and drinking champagne again, signing some kind of "agreement" with others.</p>
<p>After the Lugouqiao Incident broke out, morale was high, and we heard the calls of "swear not to…" again. But, how disappointing. I was reminded of my experiences listening to oaths in the past.</p>
<p>I hope that the curse is effective, and that the soldiers fighting the enemy in North China will no longer waste their oaths under the influence of "friendly diplomacy." Amitabha!</p>
<h3>Old Liu's Story</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>It was the deep autumn sky. Patches of cotton wool cloud streamed across the empty wilderness. The tree leaves had withered and turned yellow, and with the howling of the northern wind and sand, lashed upon the paper windows of other people. Whenever it came to times like this, Old Liu began to walk onto tragic years.</p>
<p>His age was beyond sixty years. His face was filled with a white beard, fluttering about, and atop his head, one could not count out one hundred to ten strands of hair. His leg was a bit crippled. A walking cane had become a constant companion. But if there were children who tumbled before his feet, he would regardless of his cripple quickly hug them. He would not be anxious. Ignorant children did not care about these things, and when happy, would casually knock twice upon his bald head. Sometimes when it was knocked heavily, he would use his left hand tightly to cover his head, and his right hand supported that walking cane tottering about as he left. He was also fond of drinking two cups, but from drinking, one could see the signs of the transition of the years. In the spring and autumn weather, two cups with every meal, and in the summer then changes to morning and night, like now this time of late autumn, the whole bottle of burning liquor becomes an unparalleled grace.</p>
<p>He worked as a senior clerk, (or gatekeeper), at this guild hall, sinking foot for over twenty years. At that time, he was young, with ardent feelings, and seeing injustice along the road, he could “draw out a knife to assist.” At that time, the imperial examinations had not yet been abolished, and the guild hall was specially equipped for the fellow townsmen who were taking the exams. Women were not allowed inside, and many outside vagabonds were frustrated and made squealing cries. Whenever there was any free time, they would concentrate their words in the group of women, and would not avoid it because of their own status. But what about now? The guild hall was filled with some family members, and the houses were crooked and out of shape and nothing like they once were. There were no public funds, and who would be willing to empty out their pockets to do it?</p>
<p>Speaking of this guild hall, it was quite a bit small, the two black lacquered doors were standing with a pair of stone lions, the gatekeeper's lodge where Old Liu lived was a continuous two large rooms, and behind that was a large courtyard with five courtyards, from the main hall of the hall that branched into two branches, to the west was the rear courtyard, where there was a small side door leading to the alley, and to the south was a passageway that led directly to the "watchtower." In the middle of the passageway, there was also a toilet, and the two large locust trees inside tightly covered the roof ridge of the hall, like a pergola. The watchtower was more than twice as high as the hall, and standing on the building could overlook the entire guild hall. In the past, it was said that guards were also stationed on the building to prevent unexpected events, but now, although the bunker-like watchtower was in disrepair and the guards were no longer present, the responsibility of striking the night watch every night has been on Old Liu's shoulders for more than twenty years.</p>
<p>Outside the watchtower was a desolate black kiln factory, and as soon as it got dark, traces of people were cut off. The cold weather was even more desolate and terrifying. The street lights were hung far away, and the lights were green. The police during the day had already withdrawn from their posts. Occasionally, the sharp sound of selling "fried bean noodle balls" swept across the sky, which could make you shudder and allow you to understand what a terrible scene was behind the sound. At the bottom of the watchtower was a small door that had been locked for a long time. It was said that many scholars who could not "pass the exam" committed suicide inside and were all buried inside, and therefore, the guild hall never enjoyed peace.</p>
<p>When nothing was happening, Old Liu also liked to chat with us nonsense. He said that due to his many years of experience, he had heard many ghost sounds, but no one had ever seen what ghosts looked like. If he really encountered one, his life would definitely not be safe. Old Liu was afraid of this, but he couldn't help but work, so he used burning liquor to ignite the flames in his stomach, drinking until his eyes turned red. In this way, braving the night wind, he scattered the cursed ghosts with a burst of liquor.</p>
<p>Most of the people living in the hall were honest people who did not ask about other people's affairs, nor did they allow other people's troubles to blow on their own heads. But these days it has changed. The manager of the hall, Master Zhang, did not know how two thick wool blankets went missing, which was simply a thunderbolt, turning all the families upside down. Master Zhang scolded the coachman, scolded the old woman, and also scolded Old Liu, saying that he was not careful in guarding the door, and let the thieves into the hall. From then on, the gate was closed earlier to prepare for unexpected events.</p>
<p>Four or five days passed in a hurry. This night, the moonlight was bright, as clear as a mirror. One watch had passed, and the wind was rustling the window paper, and the ceiling was also moving in a flurry. The fire in the brick pit was burning like spring. He poured the liquor for the second watch into his stomach, pinched two pieces of mutton head meat and stuffed them into his mouth, and walked along the familiar road into the passageway to the south. But for some reason, his heart was beating, as if he had lost his autonomy. He climbed up the watchtower, knocked the clapper a few times, and hurriedly walked down again. In the moonlight, he saw two gray-white things moving in the hall, moving, seemingly preparing to pounce on him directly. With a loud shout, he rolled a somersault to the ground.</p>
<p>The people living together surrounded him from all sides, shouting wildly. Some even took up weapons. Old Liu's face turned iron blue, his teeth were grinding loudly, and his fingers were pointing at the hall. So these people shouted again and rushed over, opened the hall door, and as a result, caught two people, one was Master Zhang's coachman, and the other was the young old woman from the rear courtyard. The two thick wool blankets that had been lost were padded under their bodies.</p>
<p>Finally, Old Liu peacefully left behind this long-term job and transferred it to a novice.</p>
<h3>Where to Go</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhu</p>
<p>He wiped the large round stool used as a table with a piece of paper, then picked up the bowls and chopsticks, and looked down the staircase with his reading glasses perched on the bridge of his nose. His wife had not yet come. He paced heavily on the floor with his hands behind his back.</p>
<p>His five-year-old son, who was always stuck in this old attic room, probably smelled the aroma of rice in the pot:</p>
<p>"Daddy, my tummy hurts."</p>
<p>"This is hunger pains. There's rice today, we'll eat together when your mother gets off work. Don't cry."</p>
<p>Although he told his son not to cry, seeing his son hungry like a dried toad, he couldn't help but feel a lump in his throat. He had suffered three years of prison life, and although he had not died, his eyes had become half blind. He was only twenty-eight years old… It would have been better to die, but now he had to suffer this living hell… It had been two years since he left the reformatory. Old friends were suspicious, and new friends were… On the contrary, he had to rely entirely on his wife to work hard in the Japanese yarn factory to earn money to live. His son would definitely not be able to escape hunger in the future, but this small life… It was too tragic.</p>
<h3>War</h3>
<p>After Abyssinia was propagandized with "civilization" by Italian troops using poison gas, the Soviet-made documentary "Abyssinia" was also "civilized" once in Shanghai by Italian sailors using wooden sticks and sulfur water. However, today (the 13th), I read a radio address by the Pope of Rome, the main purpose of which was to urge people to "pray for peace," saying, "The world is turbulent, the people are suffering, today's pain has not been removed, tomorrow's fear has arrived, we should appeal to God for peace for this world and for these people."</p>
<p>We should ask the Pope of Rome to explain in detail why the world is turbulent and why the people are suffering. Who does not want a peaceful world and a happy life?</p>
<p>But the people of Abyssinia are dying and wounded everywhere, and even the king has fled to another country. Whose fault is this? It feels too late for the Pope of Rome to "pray for peace" at this time!</p>
<p>The world is already turbulent, and the people have long been suffering. After "increasing troops," if you want to talk about "friendship," even "barbarians" understand the way of survival. The pipe dream of "praying for peace" is something only "civilized people" can think of.</p>
<p>To survive, one must fight! Repay those who strike with strikes!</p>

<p>Ah! He couldn't think, shook his head, wiped away the tear stains on his glasses, and forced himself to lean against the window to look at a patch of sky like a waterfall. The soft sunlight was melting on the smiling faces of pedestrians on the road. He looked back with a bitter face, unconsciously gazing at the long-dilapidated house, and remembered that the opium-smoking female landlord had already dismissed him this morning because he hadn't paid the rent for two months. He sighed helplessly, turned his head, and didn't want to look at anything anymore. But his dim vision fell on the bed made of wooden planks, and in the cotton wool on this bed slept a two-month-old son; he seemed to suddenly realize that he still had a son, and with a mournful "Oh," he sat down on the wooden stool like a log. His eldest son squatted there, staring at him blankly.</p>
<p>His wife came over with her head down. Her face was even paler today, intertwined with anger and sorrow. She swayed and fell on the bed, gasping for breath. The baby was awakened and cried hoarsely. She had to force herself to pick him up and breastfeed him, her rough hands trembling on the baby's body.</p>
<p>He quickly served rice and brought out the half-piece of moldy tofu left over from yesterday. Only then did the eldest child quietly climb onto the stool to eat.</p>
<p>"Qiuping, you should breastfeed and eat at the same time as before, or you'll be late for work again. Deduction of wages—you seem to be sick today!"</p>
<p>"Go to work? Alas, there's a general strike."</p>
<p>His whole body went numb, and his heart was pounding wildly. The couple looked at each other in pain, unable to say a word. Finally, finally, two teardrops glistened in his wife's sunken eyes.</p>
<p>"The workers shed sweat and blood, spinning yarn for the devils all day long, but they only give you three or four dimes. This should be a strike. This time, for everyone, I was actually an instigator—but, thinking for ourselves, we are already desperately poor, how can we not have work!"</p>
<p>The brave, thin woman shed two lines of tears deeply, deeply, dripping on the furry face of the baby in her arms.</p>
<p>His throat choked, and he couldn't say a word. The yellow rice in the bowl gradually cooled, and several flies flew from the baby's diaper and settled on it. He waved his hand subconsciously; he happened to see his son burying his head and eating desperately. Yes, he hadn't eaten rice for more than ten days. He stared at his son in a daze. The son drew two smile lines like an old man's wrinkles on his gray face:</p>
<p>"Dad, it's good to eat today!"</p>
<p>A chill ran down his spine. He suddenly ran over and kissed his son's face wildly. After a long while, he blurted out, "Child, you've really suffered!"</p>
<p>The room was temporarily silent. Several car horns came from the road, but the familiar long whistle of the factory that was heard every day was gone.</p>
<p>"What should we do now? Xiafu!" She looked at him with a pale face, raising her head.</p>
<p>He was extremely tired, but he held her hand tightly:</p>
<p>"The landlord dismissed us from the house today. What else can I say? You're really too pitiful.—Yesterday, Old Huang told me that a company wanted to find a copyist. He asked if I would go. My eyes are about to go blind, how can I go? I didn't agree to him. Now I think I have no choice but to go." He paused and put on the long gown:</p>
<p>"I'm going to find Old Huang. I don't know if it's too late."</p>
<p>His wife cried. She choked and said:</p>
<p>"Eat before you go..."</p>

<h3>Experiences in Driving</h3>
<p>— By Yuan</p>
<p>㊀ Descending a Mountain: When driving down a steep and rugged mountain slope, do not be reckless and use low gear. Try to get extra braking power from the engine. Modern brakes are of great help in dangerous downhill situations.</p>
<p>㊁ Hold Firmly: In strong winds, hold the steering wheel firmly, especially on roads with houses or trees on the sides that suddenly disappear. Deal with situations carefully and do not be careless. When you are following other vehicles, a gust of wind can change the direction of the vehicle in front, unexpectedly causing an accident.</p>
<p>㊂ Nimbleness: When driving in narrow places, the more nimble you are with the steering wheel, the better. It is best to make this action a habit, especially for many new cars, which require more turns of the steering wheel. Many drivers waste valuable time and space because they turn the steering wheel too slowly.</p>
<p>㊃ Do Not Dust: People often use a dry duster to clean dust from cars. This easily damages the paint. It is best to use water to clean the car body to avoid accidental damage.</p>
<p>㊄ Gasoline Consumption: Unless a very long distance is traveled, tests of gasoline consumption often mislead us. Road conditions, average speed, and climate all affect the test results. If we want to get accurate figures, we cannot rely on the gasoline gauge. Even gasoline pumps are sometimes inaccurate. Therefore, it is most reliable to measure gasoline from the fuel tank with an accurate dipstick.</p>
<p>㊅ Easy Steering: If the pressure in the front tires is two pounds higher than usual, it will not harm the tires and can make heavy steering relatively easy.</p>
<p>㊆ Foggy Shadows: When following other vehicles on foggy nights, it is best to turn off our own headlights. Otherwise, a dark shadow will appear in front of the vehicle in front, making the situation doubly dangerous.</p>
<p>㊇ Seize Opportunities: Do not rush ourselves. If we are eager to reach our destination, do not create opportunities where there are none. Only take advantage of existing opportunities. Recklessness is a major cause of delay.</p>
<p>㊈ Understand the Route First: Study the map carefully if we are going to an unfamiliar place. Know the route first and then drive according to it. Hesitation along the way wastes time, and hesitant people often get lost.</p>
<p>㊉ Smooth Braking: The technique of smooth braking is easy to learn with frequent practice. This allows the car to be driven safely on slippery roads. The method of rapid use of the pedal is, of course, different. However, attention must be paid to the extent to which the pedal is used. Complete success also depends on whether the brake can be operated easily. Because of this, if the brake drums are scratched, they should be removed for correction, and damaged linings should be replaced.</p>
<p>㊉㊀ Oversized Tires: If we decide to install an oversized tire, we must consult the tire manufacturer. They have expert knowledge and experience in installing tires, so we can trust them to know all the hidden difficulties. In addition to the question of whether the oversized tire is properly installed on the wheel rim, the tire must also undergo additional clearance. Because adding some weight can sometimes cause the front wheels to wobble.</p>
<p>㊉㊁ Stable Parking: When changing wheels, if the car body is not equipped with a permanent jack, we must safely lift the axle off the road with a portable jack. Then apply the handbrake to prevent the car body from rotating. The force used to loosen the bolts is great. If the car body cannot be braked properly and lifted stably, it is easy to turn.</p>
<p>㊉㊂ Foggy Windows: When the inside of the front window is obscured by fog, open the window or vent slightly to allow the air inside the car to circulate. A feature of car heaters is to prevent the car from getting foggy.</p>
<p>㊉㊃ Easy Cleaning: A car body (such as gray, except for light colors) needs to be washed less often than a dark black one. In other words, dark black car bodies must be washed frequently.</p>
<p>㊉㊄ Comfortable Driving: Sitting in a large car body, even at a slow speed, can be more comfortable than in a small car body on rough roads.</p>
<p>㊉㊅ Uncovered Trunk: A luggage trunk that is outside but has no cover and can only be accessed by reaching into the back seat is not as convenient as one with a cover. Unless it is not commonly used, it will cause us unexpected trouble.</p>
<p>㊉㊆ Pump Lubrication: Water pumps should always be lubricated with high-melting-point lubricating grease because this type of grease does not easily mix with water. Inferior lubricating grease will not only fail to lubricate but may also get into the cooling system.</p>
<h3>The Serious Problem of Automobile Accidents (Continued)</h3>
<p>— By Yun</p>
<p>Education is a positive method to prevent automobile accidents. Recently, various public groups have been working hard on this matter. Moreover, what they are educating is not only limited to children but also includes adults. In the past fourteen years, due to the success of education, it has been reduced by one-fifth. The American Automobile Association, school authorities, and parent-teacher groups are working hard to carry out safety campaigns in schools. Currently, the American Automobile Association's teaching materials for training young automobile drivers have been implemented in 2,500 new high schools in New York, Maine, Pennsylvania, and Abomai. In addition, the association has organized 3,000 propaganda teams in the community to specifically promote safety campaigns. In this way, many students, approximately 7,000,000, have a great deal of basic safety knowledge.</p>
<p>Many municipal authorities, in order to help automobile drivers not violate regulations too often, send them to driving schools after they have committed violations to help them develop good driving habits. Chicago has already built a place specifically for drivers to practice, and many other places are following suit. All driving lessons are conducted by experts. Various agencies also often post leaflets, pictures, slogans, etc., to alert drivers.</p>
<p>Scientists have also invented many instruments and tools to perform various tests to accurately show all the driver's problems and habits. From then on, we can try to improve without a clue. The relationship between driving and the influence of alcohol, the dangers of speed, etc., have been analyzed very clearly. Research is also being conducted on how to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. In addition to car factories, tire factories and oil factories are also participating in the work of safety campaigns. The transportation research departments of Harvard University and Northwestern University are both beneficial and well-known.</p>
<h3>1937 is an Active Year for Mid-Priced Cars</h3>
<p>— By Yingdai</p>
<p>In the American automobile industry, the year 1937 is unanimously recognized as the most active year for mid-priced cars. Indeed, the facts tell us that the recession is over. All industries have stepped onto the road to recovery. The automobile industry is, of course, no exception. Moreover, it is relatively more prosperous. There are many events that symbolize that automobile sales will continue to increase in 1937, and the numbers will exceed those of 1936. We know that, according to the statistical chart, the number of cars sold by American factories in 1936 increased by 26% compared to 1935. The general increase in national income and the improvement in packaging methods all make car owners want to buy a new car in 1937. As soon as the new cars from various factories are put into the showrooms, customers flock to them. These facts, of course, convince us that automobile sales in 1937 will increase even more than in 1936. In the current situation, the automobile industry estimates that sales this year will increase by at least 10% compared to last year. Overly optimistic people even think that it will not be less than 10%. As a result, all car factories, starting from this year, are actively expanding their operations, purchasing components, and striving to increase production by millions of vehicles. Because many orders were sent to various factories before the end of the year. Every new car is sold as soon as it is made. This situation has not been seen for many years.</p>
<p>The increase in the income of the American people not only makes them want to buy cars but also makes them want to buy better and more comfortable cars. Therefore, when buying a new car, they do not care if the price is higher. In 1936, the number of cars priced above US$700 increased by 42% compared to 1935, but the total number only increased by 26%. The sales of cars priced from $850 to $1,200 in 1936 increased by 95% compared to 1935. The sales of cars priced from $1,200 to $2,000 increased by 63%. As for the lowest-priced cars, they only increased by 18.3%. This trend will continue in 1937 due to the increase in national purchasing power. Indeed, national income is closely related to the automobile industry. When we think back to the year 1928-29, the total national income of the entire United States was 80 billion yuan, of which 4.1% was spent on automobiles. In 1932, income fell to 40 billion yuan. That year, only 2.4% was spent on automobiles. However, after 1932, a new trend occurred in the automobile industry, that is, the manufacture of new cars focused on improving materials and reducing prices. The average cost of a car decreased from 895 yuan in the heyday to 690 yuan in 1935. This downward trend allows the American people to purchase cars with their current income of 50 billion yuan, which is equivalent to the purchasing power of 100 billion yuan in the past. The total national income in 1935 was 56 billion yuan, and in 1936 it was 60 billion yuan. Based on this calculation, it will be 65 billion yuan in 1937, and automobile sales can increase by 35% compared to last year. However, whether this goal can be achieved, we still have to wait for the facts to prove.</p>
<h3>The Most Needed Skoda Cars Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— By Fu</p>
<p>Skoda cars, produced by the Czech Lav Skoda automobile factory, are known worldwide for their exceptional fuel economy and high performance. They have long been popular throughout Europe. Fulin Automobile Company in this city recently recognized that highway transportation in China is becoming increasingly developed, and that low-priced cars with exceptionally high performance are especially suitable for the needs of the general public. Therefore, they contacted the Skoda factory to negotiate a sales agreement. Now, the first batch of new cars has arrived here a few days ago. What is the general situation? This is something that the automobile industry wants to know. Therefore, I am specially summarizing it as follows.</p>
<p>The engine of the Skoda car adopts rubber suspension and is a water-cooled four-cylinder, four-stroke type with upright valves. The actual horsepower is 22, and the rated horsepower is 10.4. The cylinder jacket is excellent. Lightweight alloy precision-made automatic heat-regulating pistons. Pressure lubrication system. Down-draft carburetor with automatic spark advance control device. Battery ignition. Electric starter. Flexible and natural single-disc clutch. Transmission integrated with the rear axle housing. Three forward speeds. The second and third gears are silent harmonic types. The drive shaft is extremely balanced regardless of whether it is moving or stationary. Four-wheel independent suspension. Mechanical four-wheel brakes and independent handbrake. The steering mechanism is excellently made and is not subject to shocks. Left-hand or right-hand drive can be installed as needed. The chassis frame is specially strong and solid. Being in the streamline steel plate body makes you feel more comfortable. Not only is its appearance beautiful, moving, noble, and magnificent. It goes without saying that driving it, no matter what the road is like, is effortless and easy to handle. And its safety and reliability are therefore unparalleled.</p>
<p>In addition, what is particularly worth mentioning is Skoda's special economic efficiency. Skoda's mileage per gallon of gasoline is 38 miles. The mileage per pint of engine oil is 1,420 miles. Any part of the car body, chassis frame, and machinery is made of specially selected materials and precision-made and has undergone strict inspection. Therefore, they are all excellent and durable. And the minimal repair expenses are therefore a natural result. As for its selling price, it is said that it will be cheaper than similar British and American products. Then, in terms of purchase cost, Skoda will be the most economical. Skoda has these many advantages. This is why automobile industry experts in this city generally recognize it as the most needed low-priced car and predict that it will definitely cause a sensation in the entire automobile industry and be enthusiastically welcomed by the general public.</p>
<p>In America, the Highway Safety Movement (Y.) puts up signs that mean, "Welcome, fool. Try to die sooner." It is a wake-up call for reckless drivers.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Automobiles and Agriculture - A Farmer's Confession</h3>
<p>— By Ying</p>
<p>In the past few years, a recession has been evident in rural areas of England and America. Therefore, those farmers, facing the tragic situation of imminent bankruptcy, wanted to use the power of various automobiles to reduce the cost of agricultural products. In other words, they wanted to apply machinery more widely to rural areas, so that all agricultural products could benefit from the help of machines and the cost could be reduced. The automobile is a powerful tool for transportation. Since farmers in those countries were eager to obtain the help of machines, they naturally hoped that automobiles could also help agriculture. Therefore, in response to the needs of farmers, a type of rice-harvesting automobile began to appear. If farmers collect rice using clumsy wooden or iron vehicles, it will of course be much slower than with light and convenient automobiles.</p>
<p>Initially, in England, there were thirteen vehicles for collecting rice. One side was nailed to the chassis, and the other side was tied to the car body. This rice-collecting vehicle was two feet high off the ground, and the front end sloped down to the ground, forming a huge fork shape. In this way, when the rice-collecting vehicle moved forward, it automatically collected rice in the fields. Wherever the vehicle passed, every grain of rice on every stalk could be picked up by this automobile. A farmer in Philadia once wrote an article that was published in Austin Magazine. He said to us: "I really want to buy a powerful agricultural automobile with a speed of about twenty miles per hour, so that I can get a lot of effect during the rice-collecting season. This problem is very difficult, because the price of this vehicle must be low, and it must not require frequent repairs."</p>
<p>"But I later heard that a 1921 Austin No. 20 agricultural vehicle was for sale, thirty miles away from us. Therefore, one afternoon, I went to visit. In my mind, if this vehicle was suitable, then even if the price exceeded my limit, as long as the difference was not too great, I would buy it back and give it a try. However, what I passed through was a quiet town, (to be continued)"</p>
