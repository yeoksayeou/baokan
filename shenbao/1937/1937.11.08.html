<h3>蘇聯陸長朂勉軍人枕戈待命捍衛疆土</h3>
<p>全國熱烈慶祝十月革命紀念　紅色廣塲舉行盛大閱兵典禮</p>
<p>［莫斯科］蘇俄國防人民委員伏羅希洛夫於十月革命二十週紀念之前夕、向蘇俄紅軍發表宣言、警告他國、謂蘇俄如不得已而自衞、已準備作戰、伏氏云、“吾人已屢次答復好戰之徒、告以吾人雖不欲戰爭、惟亦早有準備、不懼戰爭、紅軍之實力、年有增加、戰術新穎、訓練精良、久為敵人所戒懼，惟法西斯間諜尚未放棄其破壞吾人之企圖、故吾人仍宜隨時提防其陰謀”云、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］本日乃係蘇聯革命二十週年紀念、政府特在紅色廣塲、舉行盛大閱兵典禮、由史丹林親任主席、坦克車隊以及機械化部隊、均皆參加、陣容之盛、為前此所未有、蘇聯當局之意、乃欲藉以使各法西斯國家對於蘇聯知所畏懼、全城各處均張燈結綵、懸掛紅旗、並張貼馬克斯•思格斯。列寗•史丹林•諸人之肖像、情况至為𤍠烈、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>汪主席等致祝賀為和平努力相勉</h3>
<p>［南京］七日為蘇聯十月革命二十週紀念日、汪主席•孫院長•馮副委員長及中蘇文化恊會、均致函蘇聯大使館道賀汪主席函中有“敬祝貴國國運隆昌、人民福利、並願貴我兩國携手為全世界尤其遠東之和平而努力”之語、林主席代表及孔副院長中宣部邵部長等、均訪蘇聯代辦梅拉美德致賀、蘇聯塔斯社亦收到致賀函電甚多云、（七日中央社電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯政府報論文對侵略國致警告</h3>
<p>［莫斯科］消息報為慶祝革命二十週紀念、載有一文、述法西斯主義之危害謂國民當牢憶史丹林所發敵人現僅待適當機會攻擊蘇聯之警告、戰爭之大火、巳在蘇聯邊界之外焚燒甚熾、阿比西尼亞•西班牙•中國•均被捲入殲滅性野蠻屠殺之烈熖中、法西斯主義危害各民族、吾人曾對付好戰者咆哮之詭謀、今又將對付之矣、吾人不欲戰爭、但吾人不畏戰爭、吾人並凖備戰爭、文中並讚揚蘇維埃國、史丹林今日曾參加莫斯科蘇維埃大劇院之大會、與會者有高級官員與工會領袖等、外國蘇維埃勞工代表團若干亦曾參加慶祝、（中央社七日路透電）</p>
<h3>第三國際發宣言籲請民治國團結</h3>
<p>［莫斯科］蘇聯第三國際為慶祝革命二十週紀念、特發表宣言、籲請世界民主力量聯合一致、以援助中國及西班牙、並稱、“此後法西斯之益匪、是否能以世界戰爭加諸人類、卽可以中國及西班牙戰爭之緒果覘得之”該宜言并主張國際工人陣綫之建立、以與法西斯主義相抗、關於德意日三國反共公約之訂立、第三國際宣稱、該三國家內之工人鑒於蘇聯社會主義二十年來之成就、將乘第二次戰爭之機會、以引起革命、卽如西班牙之工人亦已為一民主共和國之新榜樣而戰爭云、（中央社日路透電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］今日乃係蘇聯十月革命二十週年紀念、共產國際執行委員會、昨發表告全世界工人書、略謂、“第一次帝國主義世界大戰結束以還、於茲將近二十年、目下第二次帝國主義世界大戰之慘禍、又復迫在目前、此次大戰必較上次更為殘酷、固不待言、法西斯黨已使人類四分之一、陷於戰爭浩刧、而各資產階級之民治國、對於法西斯黨此種罪行、復加以縱容、各資本主義國勞工羣衆、現已開始認識過去失敗之原因、時至今日、人民陣綫運動、無論在資本主義國或法西斯獨裁國、均有長足進展、法國人民陣綫運動、業使工人之民主權利與經濟利益為之擴大、中國民族現正從事英勇抗戰、保衛祖國抵抗日本、法西斯軍閥之侵略、全世界各國工人、對於中國與西班牙兩大民族之英勇鬭爭、應努力予以援助、蓋保衛中國與西班牙、卽所以維護世界和平”也、結論則提出下列口號、卽“人民陣綫反法西斯主義與反戰運動萬歲”、“打倒資本主義、全世界無產階級革命萬歲”、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法西斯結成集團世界和平受威脅</h3>
<p>華盛頓政府當局感不安　日侵略野心固志不在小　野心不戢列强將自焚身</p>
<p>［華盛頓］德意日三國所簽訂之反共公約、頗使美國政府為之不安、蓋思想集團之政策、實與美國政府所主張之和平政策、背道而馳、抑德意日三國所推行之政策、結果所屆、勢必發動反共神聖戰爭、苟然、則於南美洲不無影響、此美國政府所由深為疑懼也、紐約泰晤士報謂、“南美洲各國倘發生右派革命、則革命分子或將由參加反共集團之國家加以援助、此層實大可殷憂、且葡萄牙將來亦有加入反共公約之可能、該國與南美洲若干國家、係屬同種、茍然、則將來或不免引起歐洲各國干涉美洲之事務、此則與美國之生存利益密切相關者也”云、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國務部當局對於羅馬反共恊定、雖無正式表示、惟在私人方面則稱、此項恊定僅足增加全世界之緊張局勢而已、自此法西斯及凖法西斯國家反對民治主義之陣綫、將益鞏固、卽白魯塞爾會議之前途、亦將因日本之態度更加强硬而愈見困難、若干方面以為德意二國或將利用此項恊定、在拉丁美洲培殖法西斯主義、官方對於此點、亦無所批評、惟悉美國政府已久知歐洲國家甚欲使中美南美法西斯化云、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>［舊金山］著名旅行家哥德、今日於此間共和俱樂部中演說、略謂據彼視察、日本統治階級之野心、决不以征服中國為巳足、於征服中國之後、必繼之以英屬印度之征服、卽荷屬印度亦所難免、第三步則為拉丁美洲之征服、據哥德言、現由秘魯前往巴西之日人、無慮有數千人、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］法西斯報紙今日於一致贊成意國參加反共恊定之外、復盛稱日本海軍在太平洋中之優勢、謂日本艦隊之數量、雖與美國不相上下、然太平洋中則佔優勢、因美國艦隊開往菲列賓羣島、須二十日之久、而日本則僅須三日、此種言論顯係針對美國國內之反法西斯及反日情緒而發、且亦可為對於白魯塞爾會議中、英美法三國聯合陣綫之警告、同時各報亦謂羅斯福總統之芝加哥演說、已使意相墨索里尼深信美國意欲放棄其孤立政策云、（六日國民電）</p>
<h3>美明年度造艦程序</h3>
<p>［華盛頓］海長史潢生上羅斯福總統之年報、表示來年美國將實行承平時代破記錄之造艦程序、報告書述一九三七年六月杪止、財政年度內之海軍事務、主張撥款興造新戰艦兩艘、此事前已言及、又主張興造每艘需費一千六百萬元之巡洋艦兩艘、及輔助艦四艘（中央社七日路透電）</p>
<h3>美國政策兩途可循</h3>
<p>認為非用武力　不足使日就範</p>
<p>—柏弗氏之正論—</p>
<p>［華盛頓］美國遠東問題專家柏弗氏、今日於“美洲雜誌”中發表一文、略謂美國於目前之中日戰爭中、唯有兩途可走、一為參加戰爭、一為袖手旁觀、柏氏又謂自彼返美以來、目擊國人對於遠東問題意見之紛歧、殊為可駭、蓋此種意見之紛歧、實於美國有莫大危險也、據彼之意、欲使日本就範、非用武力不可、否則卽無所謂對日行使壓力也、（六日國民電）</p>
<h3>阿拉斯加日船侵入捕魚</h3>
<p>當地漁業工會　要求政府制止</p>
<p>舊金山　阿拉斯加漁業工會今日宣布、日本漁船肆意破壞阿拉斯加之漁塲、美國政府如再不設法阻止、則該會自十一月十四日起、將在太平洋沿岸各埠、糾察所有抵埠之日本船隻云、（六日國民電）</p>
<h3>日意德公約附有秘密條款</h3>
<p>軍事經濟合作　反共僅為烟幕</p>
<p>［巴黎］外傳意德日三國反共公約、附有秘密議定書、規定三國互助辦法、巴黎晚報駐羅馬訪員頃就此說、叩諸羅馬日本某外交家、據答稱、“秘密議定書、若誠有之、則名為秘密、余如何可以內容相告、抑意德日三國並未受他國之攻擊、則此種議定書、有何用處、總之、意德日三國僅以共產主義國際為公敵、其對於莫斯科政府並未加以敵視、三國對於反共一層、合作範圍並無何項限制、以視訂立軍事恊定、轉足限制公約之意義、寗不較愈乎”、巴黎晚報駐羅馬訪員又以里賓特羅甫未來地位、叩諸德國某外交家、據答稱、“德國政府將以要職畀之”云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］意德日三國反共公約、頃由各報加以評論、咸謂此中定必附有秘密軍事條款、并深以各該國干涉他國內政為慮、急進社會黨、事業報”載稱、意德日三國所當成立之常設聯席委員會、當由各該國參謀部人員參加其間“未來議事日程所當首先討論者、乃各該國艦隊在國際間發生嚴重事件時相互合作問題、此項合作計畫、當在兩個月之內草擬完成、其內容乃規定日本海軍對於遠東方面英法蘇三國屬地所可出之行動、他日并將意德日三國海軍在印度洋以至紅海互相合作辦法、提付討論、”葡萄牙則當於旦夕之間、加入反共公約、即波蘭亦擬設法令其參加、此外、日本已允德意兩國參加帝國開發事宜、“日本帝國所產各種原料、凡屬德國所需者、均以之與該國工業品相交換、日德兩國並當儘速組織合資公司、一如意德兩國前此關於阿比西尼亞之所為、意國則在阿比西尼亞境內、以商務上重大利益畀予日本、以為報、酬”至以中國而論、德元首希特勒近曾面告該國軍專專家蔣百里將軍、謂宜參加反共公約、此其用意、乃欲隔斷中蘇兩國、中央派愛克西有報載稱、“某某國或當以傾向共產主義之嫌疑、而由意德日三國干涉其內政、乃至干涉其外交、一如西班牙之遭際、右派巴黎廻聲報載稱、意德日三國之新組織、與其謂以蘇聯為對𧰼、母寗謂以不列顚帝國為對𧰼，意德日三國均無攻擊蘇聯之可能、其對於英國及其屬地、則優為之、例如德國空軍可以襲擊偷敦、意國之力足以威脅埃及、日本則可威脅香港與新嘉坡、即對於法國亦何莫不然、”右派“斐伽羅報”載稱、日本當在短時期之內、承認西班牙國民軍政府、並為德國恢復舊有殖民地一項要求作聲援、“至其交換條件、則日本茍因侵略中國之故、致被各國實施經濟制裁手段、德意兩國即當為之張目、並於必要時出面調處”云、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>各報評論</h3>
<p>倫敦</p>
<p>意德日三國公約成立之後、此間各報或用大字標題予以登載、但未充分加以評論、星期萊晤士報載稱“反共公約之外、意德日三國其已成立他種諒解、特別涉及遠東戰事、並在中國境內以特殊利益許給意德兩國、或且在歐洲方面許以特殊利益、一俟戰事結束，即任其分別享受歟”、但以實際而言、日本對華作戰之後、國力即因之而削弱、其與意德兩國共同進攻蘇聯之力量、自亦因之减削、以言英國、意德日三國反共公約若有害於地中海上之利益、英國决不漠視置之云、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎</p>
<p>右派“强硬”報頃就意德日三國反共公約加以評論、略謂、意國加入反共恊定、係以德日兩國反共恊定第二條為根據、（該條規定各國凡感受共產主義國際之威脅者應由簽字國與之進行接洽、俾各該國依照本恊定精神、採取防衛措置、或加入此項恊定）“今後德意日三國大可援以為例、而邀請捷克採取防衛性質之措置、或加入反共公約、此項邀請書或以哀的美敦書形式出之、亦未可必、夫德日兩國反共恊定、原為對付東方時局而訂立、今自意國加入之後、原來性質即已為之喪失、意德日三國從而干涉歐洲國家之行政、自非不可能之事也、該報又謂、意國在阿比西尼亞方面、行將以商務上重要利益㫒予日本、急進社會黨“今晚報”載稱、意德日三國反共公約、其有“威權政策侵略遠東“之意義、不圖本月第一星期乃在和平受有威脅局勢之下、宣告結束”、時報載稱、意國參加反共恊定乃係德意兩大獨裁國與日本現行政策之當然的結果、又謂、德國調處中日兩國爭端之說、雖經正式否認、但關係方面仍相當予以重視“日本各報學稱德國調處事屬可能、由此可見東京政府對於調處之議、未始不予以歡迎”云云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>蘇聯</p>
<p>意德日三國反共公約、頃由蘇聯政界人士加以評論、咸謂各該侵略國原已成立諒解、此其所為、徒將旣成事實予以證實而已、自此而後、西歐各國所受之威脅、以視蘇俄所感受者尤為巨大、所幸全世界反法西斯主義之力量已有進展、大足以防止法西斯主義之威脅而有餘、即以蘇聯紅軍而論、其力量之强大、實足以應付一切事變、無所用其𣏌憂也云、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林</p>
<p>意德日反共公約簽字之後、各報評論均謂反對共產主義之鬥爭、今已趨入新階段、柏林日報載稱、“歐洲境內共產主義之危險、現已較前有增、但同時反共陣綫之力量亦已增加、此項陣綫具有防禦性質、而無侵略意向、參加各國所受約束、僅在决定各項防禦性質之適當辦法、以制止第三國際之騷擾、並就第三國際活動情形交換情報、如是而已、”德意志總彙報載稱、世界各國中感受布爾希維克主義分解運動之威脅者、現惟大不列顚帝國而已、“大抵第三國際在其他各處旣無立足之地、自將加緊進行其破壞大不列顚帝國之工作”云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德意進行外交談話</h3>
<p>四項問題為主題</p>
<p>德駐英大使有易人說</p>
<p>［羅馬］首相墨索里尼•外長齊亞諾•曁德駐英大使里賓特羅甫、本日午後進行談話、所討論者係以㊀德意兩國政治軸心之運用情形、㊁兩國在中歐東歐推行共同政策、㊂西班牙內戰問題、㊃德國要求收回舊有殖民地、以及英國方面對於此項要求所發生之反嚮各項問題、最為注重、一般觀察家均以為德國所敦促意國加入德日反共恊定者、實以該國收回舊有殖民地一項要求為主要動機云、頃悉里賓特羅甫雖定於明日返國、但或當展期啟程、亦未可必、關於渠與德駐意大使哈塞爾對調之說、雖由德國方面加以否認、但哈塞爾調往倫敦、則業已內定云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］今日據可靠方面消息、德駐英大使里本特羅甫、因與英外相艾登發生齟齬、或將被召返國、據稱、英外部對於里氏在歐洲之種種任務、如最近屢次遠赴羅馬、動輒數星期不返、頗為反對、此間德國方面雖否認上項消息、惟他國外交家咸稱信有其事云（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>比京會議成敗關鍵繫於日本</h3>
<p>致日申請書內容公布</p>

<h3>隨軍日記（十）</h3>
<p>— 中央社特派隨軍記者　陳萬里</p>
<p>十月的下旬、我過了幾天新鮮的刺激的生活、這在我的生命史上、是留下了可珍貴的一頁、現在呢、我在完成了自己的任務之後完全地脫離了險境、追憶起過去的情景覺得十分够味、在這裹我將寫下了過去的一切、以作我的一隨軍日記一之補遺•因為在過去的幾天、我開始是完全處於敵機的控制之下、即使是寫日記的目的也都給剝奪了、後來又忙於轉移後的種種零星的事情、兼以心緒之不寗、“隨軍日記”因此中斷了、這在我是十分抱歉的、</p>
<p>㊀撤退之前</p>
<p>在這次抗戰之中我們的天空、幾乎完全被敵機控制、這是無庸諱言的、我們必須要等到“日落西山”之後、才能開始活動、無論是構築工事、或是調動部隊、卽使發砲、也沒有例外、所以每天敵人有二十四小時的活動時間、而我們即祗有十二小時的活動時間、至於敵人的火力比我們厲害、敵人的機械化部隊比我們多出幾倍、這都是大家所知道了的事實、處於這種情況之下、我們以全國團結一致的力量、在最高領袖的領導之下、忠勇的將士以血肉之軀、與敵人搏鬥了兩個月又十八天、才從第一道防綫、完全退守第二道防綫、這在我們是光榮的、這在我們是勝利的因為在我們原定的計劃之中、我們預定輿敵人血戰了兩個月、就退守第二道防綫而現在呢、我們巳經超過了預定的期限十八天、並且給了敵人以重大的創傷、才有秩序地撤退至第一道防綫這不是無上的光榮麼這不是絕大的勝利麼、但是遺憾就是我們在第一綫上、本來還能視守一個相當長的時間、要是沒有意外的話、雖然這在我們實在是苛求了、</p>
<p>蕰藻浜南岸之受敵、是從劉行方面撤退之後開始的、最近蕰藻浜南岸（滬太公路以西）的敵人、在十月二十三日、向我走馬塘之綫猛攻、到了二十四日的早晨走馬塘中央的老人橋、被敵突破駐守走馬塘的某帥長、在電話中向×總司令報告、總司令就命令他死守陣地非有命令、不得撤退、但是經過了一個短時間的混戰、終於撤退了、這徹退之速實在是一個意外、在二十四日的晚上、我們駐守蕰藻浜南岸（滬太公路以東）的部隊奉令開至公路以西、扼守和大塲並行之綫、將敵截住、同時在公路之東、是以塲中路為主陣地•並以廟行稍南之綫做警戒綫而沿滬太公路的部隊、也撤至姚村塘一帶、保護大塲、在這條陣綫上、我們有着相當堅强的工事我們是準備在這個陣地上、更予敵人以重大的打擊、然而這也是出乎意外的、就在二十日的上午、姚村塘方面、竟根決地被敵突破、以致竄大塲左翼的陣地、而動搖了全綫、</p>
<p>大塲之綫、雖然空破、我們忠勇的將士、還繼續和敵人不斷地血戰了二十四小時以上、戰况的激烈、實在可説是“得未曾有”、到了二十六日的晚上、我們以少數的部隊、扼守閘北彭浦和眞如三點、阻敵前進、同時其餘的部隊、就從容地撤至蘇州河的南岸、保存着原有的實力、二十七日和二十八日、留駐眞如和彭浦的部隊、也先後撤退了、而死守閘北的勇士、直至三十日的午夜、才遵最高統帥的命令、揮淚退出了閘北、從八一三滬戰塲發到現在、我們已經和敵人苦戰了兩個月又十八天、用鮮紅的熱血、染成了民族史上最光榮的一頁、</p>
<p>㊁敵機控制下的生活</p>
<p>從二十三日起、在大塲眞如和北新涇一帶的上空、總有百架以上的敵機、到處轟炸和掃射、整天沒有片刻的休止、即使是在黑夜、敵軍還是不斷的活動、照明弱在空中放射、光電如同白晝、敵機活動的目的、一方面是企圖消滅我們的力量、一方面是企圖制止我們的增援、</p>
<p>在真如附近的一個小小的村莊、便是××軍總司令部的所在地、也就是我所寄居的地方、每天三十四小時、幾乎完全處於敵機的控制之下、我們每天兩餐的時間、是在早晨五點多鐘、和晚上六點多鐘、因為這是我們僅有的解放的時間、然而有時候是運兩餐而不可得、我們每大祇吃一頓飯、我們被敵機控制的情況、只在這裹也可以明䭜了、</p>
<p>我個人是完全處於敵機的控制之下、無論是白天或是黑夜、都失去了個人行動的自由、炸彈在四周爆發、機槍在頭上掃射、我是幾乎整天躲在避彈浜裹、時刻都感覺到鐵鳥之威脅、但亦無出“懷臂而起”、眞是痛苦到了極點、但是看到了自總司令以下的人們、每一個人都照常地忙着指揮作戰、和處理軍務、這又使我感奮到幾乎流淚、在我個人最怕的、是空中機槍的掃射、因爲機槍的子彈既密、並且射程又遠、加之射擊綫是斜的、使人防不勝防、除此之外、我還有一個恐懼空中機槍掃射的特殊的理由便是二十四日的上午、就在我的住室之前、有一個農婦、被敵機所掃射、我是目睹了那鮮紅的血、從蜂窠般的創口中流出來、這慘狀到現在想起來、還不免要打個寒噤、其次呢、我討厭的是看來十分蠢笨的車轟炸機、它可以大模大樣、毫不灣身地下蛋、這便是所謂、水平轟炸、旣無聲響、又很隨便、也頗使人有、猝不及防一之感、至於輕轟炸機之類、到後來却亦並不介意”了、</p>
<p>完全處於敵機的控制之下、我過了整整的四天、“寢食不安”和“度日如年”這八個字、可以說是寫盡了敵機控制下的生活、白天是連吃飯也不得自由、晚上是連睡眠也不得安定、整天幾乎完全在地下室里生活、有時候跑出了地下室、祇想得到一個伸一伸腰的休息的機會、但是立刻會聽到嗡嗡的重轟炸機、從頭上飛過、不是密集的機槍、在空中掃射、便是重量的炸彈、在附近爆發、馬上把你重又趕進地下室去、真是“寝食不安”、真是“度日如年”、可是到現在回想起來、這種生活、倒是挺新鮮的、挺刺激的、（未完）</p>

<h3>蘇州河鏖戰一週記</h3>
<p>— 珊</p>
<p>自從我軍因戰略上的關係，自動將右翼和中路移防到蘇州河以後，這一條靜寂的河流，頓時成了軍事上的要地，亦即是我淞滬抗戰中的國防第一綫了。因爲牠的重要，和牠流域附近交通上便利的緣故，所以更加成了軍事上的重心</p>
<p>那裏我們築有十分鞏固的工事，并且配備着雄厚的兵力，倘若敵人要來嘗試的話，凖定可以給牠一個嚴重的打擊和慘敗，也許甚至全軍覆沒，這是已經有許多過去的事實吿訴我們，雖然過去我們也有相當的犧牲，爲國捐軀，但是爲了爭求民族的生存，要消滅我們中華民族的唯一敵人——日本，無論犧牲我們多少勇士，流多少無辜人民的血，毀滅了我們所有的建設，以及一切的一切，我們也值得的，願意的，是偉大而壯烈的！</p>
<p>在十月三十一日的早上，敵軍三四十名，在曉霧未散的當兒，就開始在蘇州河的北岸活動，實行其第一次的偷渡，並且照例的在大砲一陣盲轟之下，施放烟慕，向我周家橋襲來。那時我守軍×師將士，正隱伏在蘇州河的南岸，嚴陣以待，目睹這一批敵人架起了帆布橋，屈膝蛇行，不覺彼此啞然而笑，但是等到敵人迫近的時候，那是决不寬恕的，立刻以佈成了的火網，向來敵密集的掃射，因此不到一小時，這一批敵人，已經被我全部殲滅，葬身河底了，帆布橋也變成了我們的戰利品。這天裏，敵人就始終不敢冉來進犯。</p>
<p>到了卅一日的午夜，就是十一月一日的早上，在二三點鐘的時候，大槪敵兵已深經感到我周家橋的堡壘森嚴，虎威難犯，於是改變計劃，遣其六七百名兵士，在那烟幕掩護之下，由陳家渡•馬家宅•潘家港•侯家埭•花家橋，作第二次的偷渡向我劉家宅•北新涇•屈家橋•吳家厙•廳頭一帶陣地來犯；那時候，我們的將士立即分兵堵截，我們的迫擊砲，平射砲，輕重火器和那手溜彈，好像雨點那樣的密集，落向敵人的身上去。雖然敵人想竭力頑抗大量增援，可是經過了我數小時的猛烈轟擊，敵人終於不支，被我將陳家渡•馬家宅•黃家宅•潘家港的來敵，全部擊退；同時因爲敵人的唯一渡河利器帆布橋，有幾座已經被我彈砲擊毀，所以敵兵落河掩死的，實在不少。河邊牠們的死屍，亦不及拖回去，後來還是由我們壯士把牠掩埋的。這一役，敵軍喪亡損失俱重，並且還送了我們將士不少禮物，因此不久久用需求的砲火，向我直轟，好像要借此洩憤似的。但是我們的陣地，始終還是鞏固無缺。到了當天的晚上四點鐘，就是二日的早晨，敵軍又在上述各處蠢然思動，可是結果，還是給我們忠勇將士驅逐回去。嗣後雖有接觸，這是步哨戰。我們的砲火一天沒有停過，彈多命中敵人的重要據點。但是不幸得很，我們的某團長就在這天因爲親往前綫指揮，重傷殉國，這是我們的損失！但在某團長是榮譽的，壯烈的，同時聽說還有兩位團長亦受重傷，現在正在治療中。我在這裏很虔誠的替他祝禱，盼望他們兩位早復健康，繼續殺敵！</p>
<p>在二日晚上，三日拂曉，敵兵放棄了先行的計劃，突然移兵西犯，在侯家埭•花家橋和申紀浜東岸蘇州河的交叉點，再度偷渡，向我姚家宅•廳頭•吳家厙進攻，估計牠一兵力，足在二千左右，同時陳家渡對河劉家宅方面，亦有三四百名强渡登岸，那時我上述各處的守軍，因爲敵勢猖獗，遂即出動吳家厙•廳頭•姚家宅三面的兵力，把敵軍圍住，逐步進剿，劉家宅的我軍，亦奮起與那陳家渡的敵兵接戰，當時兩處的砲火，震撼了整個的上海，彈如雨下，血肉橫飛。敵機更在上空助戰，我軍在那堅苦奮鬥之下，仍得殲滅不少敵人，經過了八九小時的猛樸，劉家宅方面的敵軍，首被北軍解决，內中有百餘名的敵兵，因為退路被堵，逃進到附近西式民房和廠房裏面去，當然仍被我們包圍，但是一部份的敵兵，乖巧得很，立刻屈膝投降，但是負嵎頑抗的，也有三四十名，不久就被陸續解决：吳家厙和廳頭的敵軍，因爲我姚家宅•張宅•蔡家宅的軍隊圍攻不懈，牠的先頭部隊已經喪亡殆盡，乃始倉皇潰退，無奈敵軍的後路未曾截斷，因此被牠在當天下午，又得增援七百餘名，再度進犯，並且在該處搆築工事，四週密佈着鐵絲網，似有圖作根據地的模樣，我軍先發制人。立即用猛烈而密集中砲火向敵陣地轟擊，敵軍就背河頑抗，到當晚八點鐘，展開激戰，但是我軍咸抱必死之心，前仆後繼，再接再厲，待至下午十時左右，我右側軍隊就克復了吳家厙的東半村，不久廳頭的西半部，亦經我左側軍隊收復，可是尚有一部份的敵軍，仍舊沒有消滅。</p>
<p>四日早上，正當我軍北進搜索殘敵的時候，不意敵人的大量援軍，也在那時候被其渡河，估計足有三千左右。那時我某某兩營的兵士，雖已遭遇到困境，但是仍奮奮勇地向敵人的陣地裏衝進去，東剿西殺，如入無人之境，敵軍的陣容，悉被我軍衝破，因此雙方就入了退戰局面，所有的砲火，完全失却了效力，全是白刃血肉之戰，搏擊之烈，空前未有。不久我後方生力軍加人作戰，就把全部的敵軍三面包圍起來，痛擊痛剿，敵軍見勢危迫，亦亟增援，在姚家宅與蔡家宅中間，狼奔豕突，希圖突圍，我們的砲火就對準子敵兵盤據的地方密切轟擊，直戰到四日晚上，有一小部的敵軍，被牠竄出了重圍，逃到了田肚宅和虞姬墩，但是一經我軍兜擊之後，牠仍竄回了吳家厙和廳頭：等到四日午夜，五日清晨，我們的軍隊和生力軍就實行反攻，憑仗我們優越的巷戰術，把敵人逐步逼走：到了五日上午六點鐘，姚家宅•張宅•蔡家宅的敵人，已經被我完全肅清。但是吳家厙和廳頭還在敵人的手裏，並且尚在添築工事，負嵎頑抗。這一役，雙方的損失均重，我軍獲得敵兵的高射機關槍一架，輕機關槍三架，三八式的步槍廿幾枝，防毒面具十幾個，子彈手溜彈無數，這許多戰利品已經運到了後方，存貯起來。我想明年我們慶祝國慶的時候，儘可以把這許多敵人的禮品來搭成幾個紀念牌坊，紀念我們抗戰的將士。</p>
<p>到了五日上午四點鐘，吳家厙和廳頭的敵人，又遣重兵，向我姚家宅•張宅•蔡家宅的陣地進攻，牠的砲火，竟是一秒鐘都没有停過,因此我們的工事,受了一些損害,被牠突了進來•那里候,我被守在八字橋•田肚宅和姜家宅的兵士，就立刻向前面推進，把蔡家宅•姚家宅•張宅和虐姬墩邱敵兵，截成了數段，各個圍殺，因此又形成了混戰的局面。一直打到當天下午，我們的陣地，還是沒有變動，並且在朱家浜的南岸，更加强了雄厚的兵力，防堵敵軍的蔓延。這一次，敵人的損失和死亡，恐怕要超過我們兩三倍，可是牠的重兵器，至今還是沒法搬運過蘇州河來。</p>
<p>同時陳家渡的敵軍，也在這天早上八九點鐘的時候，利用那天然的烟幕，雨，霧，向劉家宅方面偷渡增援，並且一面構築工事，一面就向池圈•薛家厙方面奔竄，我們的生力軍準時趕到，雙方就在這地段裏展開了血戰，我們的聯絡，一度發生過障碍，但是不久就恢復了。等到黃昏時候，大雨頃盆，我忠勇將士冒着雨拚命殺敵，弄得衣衫盡濕，結果終於把敵人趕了出去，保持着原來陣綫。到六日早上兩點鐘，敵人又增援進犯，牠的目的，自然還想奪我北龔宅•池圈等陣地，但是牠已經遭遇到我們鋒銳的阻力，恐怕還是勞而無獲，徒然在牠的死亡表上增加幾個單位罷了。</p>

<h3>山西戰事</h3>
<p>山西的情勢現在的確是十分嚴重了。數十萬敵軍上月二十八日起從東北南路向我全線總攻以來。雖節節遭遇了我軍奮勇的抵抗。到最近終於深入了太原的近郊。太原是我黃河以北僅存的政治上經濟上重要的中心。現在可就免不了遭受砲火的洗禮。這個城市的運命如何。要看眼前當地我數十萬軍民對暴敵血戰的結果來决定了。</p>
<p>就大勢看来。太原也許遲早是要淪陷敵手的。然而我們郤不必因此長歎。山西各路軍隊以往煊赫的戰蹟已使我們獲得相當的滿意了。那些英勇的部隊還是散布在全省山區。隨時可以給予敵人劇烈的打擊。卽使太原不幸失了守。山西全境的軍民也一定要咬緊着牙關。在險要的山地。接連不斷地跟敵人拚命下去。况且敵人在攻太原的戰役。已經遭受了遠出意外的犧牲與損失。而對於此後太原城的巷戰又未必有多大成功的把握呢。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>論“經濟互利主義”</h3>
<p>— 孫懷仁</p>
<p>最近美國國務部次長韋爾斯說：“美國深信其改善國際經濟之原則，遠東方面若能效法，世界各處予以採取，必可有裨於解决當前之問題”，接着他還說：“最近美國特使台維斯所謂遠東問題包含經濟成份，同時並聲明美國主張以此項經濟成份，爲解决戰事之前提云云，卽根據於上述之信念，除此以外，美國卽無其他切實之建議”。由這個談話看來，可以知道美國目前對於遠東中日的戰事，似乎還想掮出一塊“經濟互利主義”的招牌來調解，那是很顯然的。美國的這種論調，在言者也許是毫無惡意，可是我們却不能諱言，美國已中了日本宣傳的毒素了。</p>
<p>所謂國際經濟的互利，這思想從許多自由主義的學者提倡以來，雖然已經有了相當長久的歷史，但我們却不能不承認，到現在這個法西主義猖獗的時代，那種國際經濟互利的古典思想，實在早已宣告了死刑。換一句話說，在目前這個殺氣騰騰的世界中，再要來談什麼國際經濟互利，這可以說是不識時務，關於這一點，美國實在是更應該有一個事實敎訓的，一九三三年世界經濟會議之不能如美國意想的成功，這不正是說這世界上早已沒有什麼眞的互利了嗎？</p>
<p>本來，“經濟互利”這個名詞，也正如“自由”的這個名詞，用得得當是好名詞，用得不得當便成爲了罪惡。在這世界中，眞的國際經濟互利主義，雖然已成爲了殘骸，但是侵路者也仍不妨利用“經濟互利”來做侵略的幌子。這次中日的戰事，在日本方面，誠然是加罪於我們的，說我們不能與牠在政治經濟上合作，然而這究竟是事實嗎？政治方面姑置不論，就是說經濟方面罷，我們在東北淪陷以後，也曾含垢忍辱的談過經濟提携，靦颜的成立過貿易協會，禮讓爲懷的來過火柴聯營，諸如此類，不勝枚舉，這樣還能說我們不與日本經濟互利嗎？到如今，日本已陳軍五十萬於中國領士之上，開始武力侵略，而我們也已忍無可忍的開始了神聖的民族抗戰，在這事實情形下，　設“遠東問題包含經濟成份”，“以此項經濟成份爲解决戰事之前提”，而　　日經濟互利，以弭戰亂，這不顯然是一種錯誤的觀察嗎？</p>
<p>老實說，在日本的心目中，牠能滿意的經濟互利，就是呌中國做日本之經濟的奴隸，因此，美國所謂解决戰事前提的經濟成份，而使日本也能答應的，除非是呌我們讓步爲奴隸，然而這一點，我敢說我們每一個有血性的中國人都是不能容忍的。所以，我們在這裏可以很誠懇的告訴友邦美國，在這次中日戰事中，已談不上什麼“經濟互利”，在日本侵略不停止的時候，所謂“互利”，也不過是日本的“獨利”。我們不否認，我們的經濟誠然是非常落後，我們也很誠意與世界任何國家眞正經濟互利，可是要我們能得到眞正“互利”，各友邦就應該先聲援我們，讓我們打倒“僞互利”。假若美國要在這次中日戰事中，來建議“經濟互利主義”，那實在不啻是毀壞自己信念的國際經濟原則，使眞正的國際經濟互利主義，永遠不得復活。</p>

<h3>日本畏“杯葛”（續）</h3>
<p>— 美國烏特萊著特譯</p>
<p>英美經濟武器　能够終止戰爭</p>
<p>大都替五十萬或此數以上的田主耕種，每年把收穫之米半數以上，交給田主，以爲田租。田主並不供給種籽肥料資本。另有自置田地的農民，雖可自耕自收，但借入的資本，須付極高的利率，所以他們也同樣困苦。總而言之，日本的農民，差不多沒有一人不是債臺高築的。</p>
<p>這種封建時代的社會和經濟關係，直到如今，還存在着，結果使內國銷路，非常狹窄，農村人民貧窮不堪，縱在農產價貴之時，也無力積蓄資本，購買機械，革新耕種的方法。因此却導成一種不相稱的工業發展，僅出於國家的命令，依大規模用新時代的技術經營輸出品的工業，如紡織品之類，此外還經營軍火製造業。至於國內大多數的工業，不過一個主人和幾個學徒，有時加上幾個“跑街”，出於手工製造，或利用極少的機械力。</p>
<p>較下的中級人民，如小地主盤剝重利者，小工業家商家手藝之輩爲數極巨，他們都是窮不堪言，對於控制原料貸款，對外貿易的工商業壟斷者，都恨之刺骨。利率旣高，內國銷路旣窄，使小本經紀者終身勞苦，沒有成爲小康的可能。日本並無投巨資的中級人民，國中的資本，都操在財閥三井住友安田等數家的掌握中，雖每年收入在一千二百元以上者，都得繳納所得稅，但在一九三一年繳納所得稅的只有五六九•○四六人。每年收入在五千元或五千元以上者，只有二○•五二四人。每人平均的收入，約在八百元左右。但有二十人，歲入在三十萬元至一百五十萬元之間。繳納商業盈利稅者只有七十三萬人，各項商業每年凈利在二百元或二百以上者，都得繳納這稅。</p>
<p>這種資本集中，雖在戰時，集合全國的收入，可比有多數中級人民的國家，容易實行，但在危機中，却使日本的社會制度異常不穩•農民痛惡田主和盤剝重利者，（他們實際是銀行的代理人）小工商業家痛惡財閥，已造成一座實在的火山，日本的施治階級，常常　　　　　　　性的宣傳，遏止牠的爆　、自一九三一年起，當局把社會的怨望，化爲對華侵略的贊助，一舉手而佔有滿洲，於是便把滿州前途繁榮，可使人民獲得無上幸福的空望，籠絡人民，遏止他們的叛變。但是發覺征服中國，不是一件易事，而腰帶日見收緊的人民，决不能容忍長期戰争的痛苦，那時要發生什麼事變，是可想而知的。日本佔有滿洲，並無所獲，不過增加國民的担負罷了。日本今又希望不經過眞正戰爭，而併吞華北，但也不能使農民和較下的中級人民稍爲寬慰。一個中毒的人，用食物塞飽他的肚兒，是不能救治的。日本社會機構，病太多了，不是用新殖民地所能醫愈的。滿洲荒地很多，正好移民前往墾殖，但是日本農民赴滿者，只有數百人，日政府迄未供給移民入滿的資本，當日本財閥和軍閥掌握大權之際，永不能得到這筆巨大的資本。</p>
<p>今日的危險，是在英國只圖在日本蹂躪中國之前，保全她在中國的投資，並且恐怕長期戰爭及於日本的影響，因此將壓迫中政府屈服，雖然中國的大軍並未戰敗。但中國人民的大多數，决心抗戰到底，已是一件實在的事情，中國軍隊已在上海表示非常的勇武和堅毅。今只要英美兩國恊力抵制日貨，差不多可保中國能够戰勝日本，目前的英政府，是决不會發起以經濟壓力加於日本的，因爲英政府願見日本施治的階級，依然存在，並且希望一面和日本作討價還價的談判，一面壓迫中國把華北五省割讓給日本，藉以保全他的投資。</p>
<p>雖然，假使美國决計抵制日貨，同時援引中立法，阻止賒賬售貨給日本，英政府也不得不和美國作同樣行動。這一舉不但英國的自由黨和工黨將予贊成，甚至保守黨的若干部分，也樂於贊成的，假使美醫不爲道德上或選輯上的原因，仗義救助中國，也許會因爲日本在華北的主要野心之一，是把華北變成大植棉區，從此可以不必仰賴美棉的接濟一事，有感而發動。的確，爲顧全美國植棉人的永久利益起見，很値得對日本的生絲作幾星期的杯葛。美國在中國的利益，就投資範圍而論，雖不能和英國比較，但就商業範圍而論，却也未便忽視的。</p>
<p>日本的財政，在一九二二年時，比現在强得多哩，然而那時英美兩國提携對付，不費甚力，便迫日本吐出在中國的佔領物，所以今日英美兩國倘以政治或經濟壓力加於日本，决無理由害怕美國或英國會陷入戰爭漩渦，英美兩國只要暗示合作對日實施經濟壓力，便能終止戰爭。美國能在一九二二年使英國的政策和她一致，難道一九三七年便不能如此麼？（譯紐約國家報）</p>

<h3>到前線途中（再續）</h3>
<p>— 中央社戰地特派員通訊　侍桁</p>
<p>從傷兵醫院裹出來、天剛剛過了正午、我們按照頂定的計劃、到隣近的一個美國福音敎堂去訪問一位在本地傳道有三十多年的老牧師、讀者也許會奇怪怎麼在這樣的時候、還有閒功夫丟看這種一般人稱為“宗敎的寄生蟲、好吧、藉着這个機會、我想說明我的一點存心、</p>
<p>近幾處來我國智識階級的文化工作者、從反帝國主義文化侵略的立場、對這些侵略的先鋒宣教的牧師們、給了最痛烈的攻擊、當然沒有人能替他們辯護宣敎的本身、或許是無意識的、但是他們以奴化敎育與宗教的迷信、確確實實是成了帝國主義文化侵略的工具的、不過我們也不能就忘掉他們在中國內地的那悠久的歷史、以及他們和一般中國鄉民多年相處的那種親密的情感、他們雖然處於牧師的地位、却也於無形中受着中國人民的同化、他們對於一般鄉民的愛、不完全是由於他們的虛偽的宗教造成的、</p>
<p>在如今全民抗戰的時期、這些牧師是有他們的用處、他們向外的發言、將是最好的國際宣傳、而且在內地的各國牧師、除去他們的宗敎的任務之外、有很多還是給各地的外國報紙、担任着通訊的職務的、就說陳君介紹我去訪問的這個彭牧師吧、在內地的牧師為獲得中國人民的信任都改取了中國名姓、他就是某地大陸報的通訊員、前幾年當一羣美國新聞記者到徐州來的時候、就是他介紹給富地的新聞界的、而且在我國抗戰開始以後、他還寄了一封信給駐京美大使、指摘着美國最初對中日戰事所取的態度的不當、散在中國各地、這樣熟心的牧師必定不少吧、我想我們若從旁給他們以協助與鼓勵、較之放任他們總是自動地作去、將會收表到更多效果吧、</p>
<p>不巧得很、彭牧師和他的兩三個同事下鄉去了、我們可惜沒有見到面、</p>
<p>順着路、我們又去訪問新駐紥到此地來的第××集團軍司令×××、這個被稱為××之靈魂的靑年將軍、在這裹我將不描繪他的英姿、不稱讚地的將才、我確信我們以後有的是機會來讚揚、他描繪他中國的軍人、在道次的抗戰中、巳經養成極堅强的自信心了、最後勝利的把握、深潛在他的心裹流露在他的眼中、這是我們這次訪問他、留給我的最深刻的一個印象、</p>
<p>這天晚上、從七點鐘便在徐州車站等車、直到夜四時、天將薄明的時候、北行的車才算開到、</p>
<p>車行到山東臨域的時候、已經是翌日的淸晨了、</p>
<p>八點半到離兗州不遠的界河車站車停止前進遇到警報了乘客們下車紛避火車開出站台等地方去隱藏、</p>
<p>我隨着人羣跑到車站東面約有半里地左右的小村子裏去坐在一個乾草堆房、先是聽見在遠遠的地方有了兩聲炸彈、其次飛機在頭上的天空裹盤旋、賞了一個蛋、聲音很大、心臟激劇地動盪起來了、大家猜測、這次總在停車不遠的地方吧、</p>
<p>潛伏了許久、人們才漸漸聚坐在村外的一棵大樹下聞談着、等疾解除警報、</p>
<p>不曉得從那裹從什麼時候出現了個賣花生的小販、他做了一筆意外的生意聚在樹下的旅客、每人都向他買些吃、那是一個四十歲左右的鄉民、面孔裹顯露着誠實而忠厚的樣子、可以說是一個典型的北方的農民、他用秤稱着花生的分量、嘴裹叨唸着、</p>
<p>不會少給你老的、我們是剛剛逃難出來的、不敢再騙人</p>
<p>“你從什麼地方逃來的、”</p>
<p>“滄州”、</p>
<p>“滄州過去的情形還記得些嗎、”</p>
<p>“怎麼不記得、×x軍把運河决開了、現在盡是水了、為的是擋日本兵、那怎麼擋得住、不過道次的戰打得很好、眞是“官兵一心了、”</p>
<p>“你怎麼逃出來的、”</p>
<p>“隨着大兵的鋼甲車、”</p>
<p>“大兵要你們坐麼”、</p>
<p>“要不、怎麼就吃”官民一心”呢、老百姓盡量地裝他們都很客氣、可是老百姓也對得起他們、我在時就每天給他們送飯這次打仗和從前什麼直奉直皖戰爭大不同了、那時大兵隨他到那裹也找不到一個鬼、這次老百姓自己願意替他們作要什麼就是什麼、你要住在我家裹就住在我家裏白麵沒得吃無論什麼就湊活着吧、（未完）</p>

<h3>勝利在我們的掌握中</h3>
<p>— 劉育才</p>
<p>日本帝国主義者這一次的侵略中國，可以說太不度時勢與太不量力•牠只知道憑着田中首相死板的大陸政策，來硬生生地向中國領上進據，實際上適造成其超速度的自掘墳墓的慘敗。我們可以從下面數點來加以證明：</p>
<p>一，太平洋上的各國軍備的益臻鞏固：蘇聯艦隊的激增。即此二端，日本帝國主義者已岌岌不可終日，而深恐整個的摧殘其多年盤踞着華北的經濟市場。於是為未雨綢繆計而首先發制，掀起戰雲，冀欲一鼓氣盪平華北而窺踞華中，藉資鞏固其在華北的軍事根據地，而間接防禦其他國的覬覦。</p>
<p>二，日本帝國主義者一方面又覺到國內少壯軍人的逐年激增，而在絕無出路的情境之下，這般毛頭小軍閥，於是不安穩地跳梁起來，當然囉，其目的是少壯軍人的想佔據軍政上的地位•但是為要貫澈這個目的步驟計，不得不向外侵略，而使得現任的軍部人物，無能為力和老朽昏庸地不堪勝任，少壯軍人派就在這個機會中抬頭而起，負担了侵略中國的使命，同時就在获得了軍事上的重要地位的企圖。</p>
<p>三，為了上述的二種原素，而又不敢公然主張發動侵略中國的部隊，日本的軍閥當局就利用“支那是日本的生命綫”“支那是我們獲得黃金的泉源”的愚民政策之下，來朦混日本國民的意態，至積極的秣馬厲兵大舉侵略的武備。可是日本軍閥這一種的愚民政策，實際上是根本失败了；日本國內民眾的怨聲載道，尤其是日商的聲聲痛惡其軍閥當局的措置，使對外貿易落千丈；其次是日本国內常备軍人的一致反對•按之在平時的日本軍令，如果三次軍令不發後，可以立即就地槍決的。這一次的軍部，　發下軍令有八次之多，是召集常備軍人，開赴中國來為侵略的工具，常備軍人大家在一致的不理睬的團結之下，堅决地違抗了這八次的命令，軍閥當局心勞日拙而實施的愚民政策，至此已摧毀無餘。同時又恐引起國內民眾的反感，甚至暴動起見！竟不敢加以些微的處罰，祇是悶在心裹，敢怒而不敢言宣。</p>
<p>四，自盧溝橋戰事爆發，至八一三滬戰相繼釁起，國際間的痛𧦄，中外輿論的據理抨擊，這一種同聲討伐的情勢之下，日本軍閥當局在這個到處碰壁的焦頭爛額的應日中，牠感覺到如果再不依外力來相機協助，是益發計窮而力疲了•所以德意日的反共協定，就在這個塲合中的締結，其以反共為外表的幌了，實則是侵略陣綫的集合，這一點我們必須要認淸的；這是日寇的自知失敗的補救辦法，然事實上却反促成國際間的有力的制裁。</p>
<p>綜上數點，我們很明顯的證實了日本帝國主義者的必敗是意料中事。加以日本國內的經濟基礎，因不斷的侵略中國，而在軍費膨脹之下，已根本的崩潰，民窮財盡的局勢，其能不敗者，我未之聞也。反之，在中國抗戰的立塲說，我們更可以從下面數點來證明是有必勝的把握：</p>
<p>一，中國是一個愛好和平的國家，始終不欲輕易引起戰端的。我們的領袖蔣委員長早巴說過：“和平米未絕望時期，决不放棄和平，犧牲末到最後關頭，决不輕言犧牲，”日本帝國主義者在九一八東北尋釁，佔據了我們東北三省，在一二八上海又再起戰端，把我們閘北的繁榮蹂𨈆殆盡，我們是忍受着，臥薪嘗膽地忍受着這樣的慘傷，豈知日寇貪得無厭，接着又釁起了蘆溝橋的突然侵略，這是我們已到忍無可忍的時期，和平既經絶望，犧牲亦到最後關頭，我們全國一致的發揮抗戰的自衛力，來和敵人决一死戰，這是全國民眾一致的要求，其威力是非常雄厚的。歷史告訴我們，戰爭的一方，誰為民衆所擁護和聲援的，勝利就是屬於這一方。現在全中國四萬萬五千萬民衆，都團結在全面抗戰一貫的精神上，在政府和最高領袖的指導之下，這一個威力，可以相信勝利是有充分把握的。</p>
<p>二，同時在全世界的大多數愛好和平的國家，見到這樣一個兇暴的強盜，其在侵略中國之後，必將更進一步企圖征服其他的國家，他們也義不容辭的同聲痛詆，在精神上物質上，直接聞接的予日寇重大的打擊。試問：在我們是全國民衆自覺的奮起抗戰，在敵方是愚民政策的不可靠，而將引起內鬨的局勢。在找們是全世界大多數國家的同情和聲援，在敵方是强盜們暫時茍合的打刦，以這種情祝來對比，誰也看得清楚我們的步伐，是一天比一天的走上勝利的光明大道。</p>
<p>三，另一方面，我們可以在日本國內的經濟破產和民業的痛恨軍閥酣戰的火熖中，足够使敵人應付棘手，而直接間接影響到侵略中國的不可持久。我們以長期抵抗的戰策與之配合，這正是給牠一個加速度的失敗的預兆。我們見到牠們的近衛首相的主張速戰速决一的政策，更可以昭然若揭的知道其內在的恐慌了。</p>
<p>四，日寇的侵略野心，不僅在征服中國，同時要征服世界，有控制世界各國的企圖，這就是所謂大陸政策的目的。可是事實上却適得其反的是一種自殺政策。除了同具野心侵略者的暫時勾結外，其他大多數的國家，誰也不會被你威屈。就是被日寇征服一久的韓國，潛伏着的革命勢力，現在已經抬頭起來，他們的同志會國民會等團體，一致的聯合起來反抗日本帝國主義，摧毀被壓迫的鎖練，而同仇敵愾的和我們取一致的步驟，來打倒日帝國主議，恢復韓國的獨立自由。同時也就是殲滅世界和平的強盜，這正是樹起世界各弱小民族反杭日本帝國主義的一枝生力軍，世界愛好和平的民族必將繼續而起的同聲懲討這侵略的强　。這一個的打擊結果。日本帝國主義者的失敗，純屬意料中事。</p>
<p>全國的民眾，一致的武裝起來，來發動全面抗戰的　力，來打倒世界强盗日本帝國主義！最後的勝利是屬於我們的。</p>

<h3>Soviet Army Chief Urges Soldiers to Be Ready to Defend Territory</h3>
<p>Nation Enthusiastically Celebrates Anniversary of the October Revolution; Grand Military Parade Held at Red Square</p>
<p>[Moscow] On the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the October Revolution, Soviet Russian People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov issued a declaration to the Soviet Russian Red Army, warning other countries that if Soviet Russia must defend itself, it is prepared for war. Voroshilov stated, "We have repeatedly responded to warmongers, telling them that although we do not desire war, we are prepared and not afraid of war. The strength of the Red Army increases year by year, its tactics are innovative, and its training is excellent, long feared by the enemy. However, Fascist spies have not abandoned their attempts to sabotage us, so we must remain vigilant against their conspiracies." (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Today marks the twentieth anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. The government held a grand military parade in Red Square, presided over by Stalin himself. Tank formations and mechanized units all participated, making it an unprecedented spectacle. The intention of the Soviet authorities is to use this to instill fear in the Fascist countries. The entire city was decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, hung with red flags, and posted with portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, creating a festive atmosphere.

<h3>Chairman Wang and Others Send Congratulations and Encourage Joint Efforts for Peace</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The 7th marked the twentieth anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution. Chairman Wang, President Sun, Vice Chairman Feng, and the China-Soviet Cultural Association all sent letters of congratulations to the Soviet Embassy. Chairman Wang's letter included the words "Respectfully wishing your country prosperity and its people happiness, and hoping that our two countries will work together for peace in the world, especially in the Far East." Chairman Lin's representative, along with Vice President Kong and Minister Shao of the Central Propaganda Department, visited Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Meramed to offer congratulations. TASS of the Soviet Union also received many congratulatory letters and telegrams. (Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Government Newspaper Article Issues Warning to Aggressor Nations</h3>
<p>[Moscow] In celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the revolution, the Izvestia newspaper published an article describing the dangers of Fascism, stating that the people should firmly remember Stalin's warning that the enemy is only waiting for a suitable opportunity to attack the Soviet Union. The flames of war are already burning fiercely outside the borders of the Soviet Union. Abyssinia, Spain, and China have all been engulfed in the destructive flames of barbaric slaughter. Fascism endangers all nations. We have dealt with the deceitful schemes of warmongers before, and we will deal with them again. We do not desire war, but we are not afraid of war, and we are prepared for war. The article also praised the Soviet state. Stalin today attended a conference at the Moscow Soviet Grand Theatre, along with high-ranking officials and union leaders. Several foreign Soviet labor delegations also participated in the celebration. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Third International Issues Declaration Calling for Unity Among Democratic Nations</h3>
<p>[Moscow] The Third International of the Soviet Union, in celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the revolution, issued a declaration calling on democratic forces worldwide to unite in support of China and Spain, stating, "Whether or not the Fascist bandits can inflict a world war upon humanity can be seen in the outcome of the wars in China and Spain." The declaration also advocated for the establishment of an international workers' front to oppose Fascism. Regarding the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact by Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Third International declared that the workers within these three countries, in light of the achievements of twenty years of Soviet socialism, will seize the opportunity of a second war to incite revolution, just as the workers in Spain are already fighting for a new model of a democratic republic. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Today marks the twentieth anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution. The Executive Committee of the Communist International issued a letter to workers worldwide yesterday, stating, "Nearly twenty years have passed since the end of the First Imperialist World War. Now, the catastrophe of a Second Imperialist World War is imminent. This war will undoubtedly be more brutal than the last. The Fascist Party has plunged a quarter of humanity into the ravages of war, while the bourgeois democratic nations have indulged these crimes of the Fascist Party. The laboring masses in all capitalist countries have now begun to recognize the reasons for past failures. Today, the People's Front movement has made significant progress in both capitalist and Fascist dictatorships. The People's Front movement in France has expanded the democratic rights and economic interests of workers. The Chinese nation is now engaged in a heroic resistance, defending its homeland against the aggression of Japanese Fascist warlords. Workers in all countries around the world should strive to provide assistance to the heroic struggles of the Chinese and Spanish nations, for defending China and Spain is to safeguard world peace." The conclusion put forward the following slogans: "Long live the People's Front against Fascism and the anti-war movement!" "Down with capitalism! Long live the world proletarian revolution!"

<h3>Fascist Bloc Formed; World Peace Threatened</h3>
<p>Washington Government Authorities Feel Uneasy; Japan's Aggressive Ambitions Are No Small Matter; Unrestrained Ambitions Will Cause the Powers to Burn Themselves</p>
<p>[Washington] The anti-communist pact signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan has caused considerable unease within the U.S. government, as the policy of ideological blocs runs counter to the peace policy advocated by the U.S. government. Furthermore, the policy pursued by Germany, Italy, and Japan will inevitably lead to the launch of a holy war against communism. If so, it will inevitably have an impact on South America, which is why the U.S. government is deeply apprehensive. The New York Times stated, "If right-wing revolutions occur in South American countries, the revolutionaries may be aided by countries participating in the anti-communist bloc. This is a matter of great concern, and Portugal may also join the anti-communist pact in the future. That country is related to several South American countries. If so, it may inevitably lead to European countries interfering in American affairs, which is closely related to the vital interests of the United States." (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>[Washington] While the State Department authorities have made no formal statement regarding the Rome Anti-Comintern Pact, in private they say that this pact will only increase the tension in the world. From this point on, the line between Fascist and quasi-Fascist countries opposing democracy will become more solidified. Even the prospects for the Brussels Conference will become more difficult due to Japan's increasingly tough stance. Some believe that Germany and Italy may use this pact to cultivate Fascism in Latin America. Officials have not criticized this point, but they are aware that European countries have long wanted to Fascistize Central and South America. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The famous traveler Gothe, speaking today at the Republican Club here, stated that according to his observations, the ambitions of Japan's ruling class are by no means satisfied with the conquest of China. After conquering China, they will follow it with the conquest of British India, and even the Dutch East Indies will be difficult to avoid. The third step will be the conquest of Latin America. According to Gothe, there are currently thousands of Japanese people traveling from Peru to Brazil. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>[Rome] In addition to unanimously endorsing Italy's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact, Fascist newspapers today also praised Japan's naval superiority in the Pacific, saying that although the number of Japanese warships is comparable to that of the United States, Japan has the advantage in the Pacific because it takes the U.S. fleet twenty days to reach the Philippine Islands, while Japan only needs three days. These remarks are clearly aimed at the anti-Fascist and anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States, and can also serve as a warning to the united front of Britain, the United States, and France at the Brussels Conference. At the same time, the newspapers also said that President Roosevelt's Chicago speech has deeply convinced Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that the United States intends to abandon its isolationist policy. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy's Next Year Building Program</h3>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of the Navy Swanson presented his annual report to President Roosevelt, indicating that next year the United States will implement a shipbuilding program that breaks records in peacetime. The report described naval affairs within the fiscal year ending in late June 1937, advocating for appropriations to build two new battleships, which had been previously mentioned, and also advocating for the construction of two cruisers costing 16 million yuan each, and four auxiliary ships.

<h3>Two Paths the United States Can Follow</h3>
<p>Believes that Force Is Necessary to Make Japan Yield</p>
<p>—Mr. Beverley's Sound Argument—</p>
<p>[Washington] American Far East expert Mr. Beverley published an article in the "American Magazine" today, stating that the United States only has two paths to take in the current Sino-Japanese War: one is to participate in the war, and the other is to stand idly by. Mr. Beverley also said that since his return to the United States, he has been shocked by the divisions in public opinion regarding the Far East issue, as these divisions pose a great danger to the United States. In his opinion, force is necessary to make Japan yield; otherwise, there is no so-called exerting pressure on Japan. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Invade Alaskan Waters to Fish</h3>
<p>Local Fisheries Union Demands Government Intervention</p>
<p>San Francisco The Alaska Fisheries Union announced today that Japanese fishing boats are wantonly destroying Alaskan fishing grounds. If the U.S. government does not take measures to stop them, the union will, starting November 14, patrol all Japanese ships arriving at ports along the Pacific coast. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese-Italian-German Pact Has Secret Clauses</h3>
<p>Military and Economic Cooperation; Anti-Communism Is Just a Smokescreen</p>
<p>[Paris] It is rumored that the Anti-Comintern Pact of Italy, Germany, and Japan has a secret protocol stipulating mutual assistance measures among the three countries. A Paris Evening News reporter in Rome asked a certain Japanese diplomat in Rome about this claim. The response was, "If a secret protocol truly exists, it is called secret. How can I tell you the content? Moreover, if Italy, Germany, and Japan have not been attacked by other countries, what is the use of such a protocol? In short, Italy, Germany, and Japan only regard the Communist International as a common enemy. They have not shown hostility towards the Moscow government. There are no restrictions on the scope of cooperation among the three countries in anti-communism, as military agreements would restrict the meaning of the pact. Wouldn't that be better?" The Paris Evening News reporter also asked a certain German diplomat about Ribbentrop's future position. The response was, "The German government will grant him an important position." (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Anti-Comintern Pact of Italy, Germany, and Japan has recently been commented on by various newspapers, which all said that it must have secret military clauses and are deeply concerned about the interference of these countries in the internal affairs of other countries. The Radical Socialist Party's "Business Report" stated that the standing joint committee to be established by Italy, Germany, and Japan should include personnel from the general staffs of each country. "The first item on the agenda will be the issue of mutual cooperation among the fleets of each country in the event of serious international incidents. This cooperation plan should be drafted within two months. Its content will stipulate the actions that the Japanese Navy can take against the territories of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in the Far East. In the future, the mutual cooperation measures of the Italian, German, and Japanese navies in the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea will also be submitted for discussion." Portugal will join the Anti-Comintern Pact imminently, and Poland also plans to legislate its participation. In addition, Japan has agreed to allow Germany and Italy to participate in imperial development matters. "All kinds of raw materials produced in the Japanese Empire that Germany needs will be exchanged for German industrial products. Japan and Germany will also organize joint ventures as soon as possible, just as Italy and Germany have done in Abyssinia. Italy will grant Japan significant commercial interests within Abyssinia as a reward." As for China, German Head of State Hitler recently told Chinese military expert General Jiang Baili that China should participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact. His intention is to isolate China and the Soviet Union. The Central Party's "Ekesi News" reported, "A certain country may be suspected of being inclined towards communism and may be interfered in its internal affairs by Italy, Germany, and Japan, even in its diplomacy, just like Spain's experience." The right-wing "Paris Echo" reported that the new organization of Italy, Germany, and Japan is aimed at the British Empire, not the Soviet Union. "Italy, Germany, and Japan have no possibility of attacking the Soviet Union, but they are superior to Britain and its territories. For example, the German Air Force can attack London, Italy's power is enough to threaten Egypt, and Japan can threaten Hong Kong and Singapore. The same is true for France." The right-wing "Figaro" reported that Japan will recognize the Spanish National Army government in the short term and support Germany's demand for the restoration of old colonies. "As for the exchange conditions, if Japan is subject to economic sanctions by various countries due to its invasion of China, Germany and Italy will speak out for it and mediate when necessary." (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Newspaper Comments</h3>
<p>London</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Italian-German-Japanese Pact, the newspapers here either published it with large headlines, but did not fully comment on it. The Sunday Times reported, "Outside of the Anti-Comintern Pact, Italy, Germany, and Japan have established other understandings, especially involving the Far East War, and have promised special interests to Italy and Germany within China, or even promised special interests in Europe, to be enjoyed separately after the war ends." But in reality, after Japan's war against China, its national strength will be weakened, and its strength to jointly attack the Soviet Union with Italy and Germany will also be reduced. As for Britain, if the Italian-German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact harms its interests in the Mediterranean, Britain will definitely not ignore it. (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris</p>
<p>The right-wing "Strong" newspaper recently commented on the Italian-German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, stating that Italy's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact is based on Article 2 of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact (which stipulates that countries threatened by the Communist International should be contacted by the signatory countries so that those countries can take defensive measures or join this pact in accordance with the spirit of this pact). "In the future, Germany, Italy, and Japan can use this as an example to invite the Czech Republic to take defensive measures or join the Anti-Comintern Pact. This invitation may be issued in the form of an aide-mémoire, but it is not certain. The German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact was originally established to deal with the situation in the East. Now that Italy has joined, the original nature has been lost. It is not impossible for Germany, Italy, and Japan to interfere in the administration of European countries." The newspaper also stated that Italy will grant Japan important commercial interests in Abyssinia. The Radical Socialist Party's "Evening News" reported that the Italian-German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact has the meaning of "authoritarian policy invading the Far East." "Unexpectedly, the first week of this month ended with a situation in which peace was threatened." The Times reported that Italy's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact is the natural result of the current policies of the two major dictatorships of Germany and Italy and Japan. It also said that although the claim that Germany is mediating the dispute between China and Japan has been officially denied, the relevant parties still attach considerable importance to it. "Japanese newspapers claim that German mediation is possible, which shows that the Tokyo government may not be opposed to the mediation proposal." (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Soviet Union</p>
<p>The Anti-Comintern Pact of Italy, Germany, and Japan has recently been commented on by Soviet political figures, who said that the aggressor countries have already reached an understanding. What they have done is only to confirm the fait accompli. From now on, the threat to Western European countries is even greater than that felt by Soviet Russia. Fortunately, the anti-Fascist forces worldwide have made progress and are more than sufficient to prevent the threat of Fascism. As for the Soviet Red Army, its strength is sufficient to cope with all events and does not need to worry. (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin</p>
<p>After the signing of the Italian-German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, newspaper commentaries all stated that the struggle against communism has now entered a new stage. The Berlin Daily News reported, "The danger of communism in Europe has now increased compared to before, but at the same time the strength of the anti-communist front has also increased. This front is defensive in nature and has no intention of aggression. The participating countries are only bound by deciding on appropriate methods of a defensive nature to stop the harassment of the Third International and to exchange information on the activities of the Third International. That's all." The German General Review reported that among the countries in the world threatened by the disintegrating movement of Bolshevism, only the British Empire remains. "Generally speaking, since the Third International has no foothold elsewhere, it will intensify its work of destroying the British Empire." (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>German and Italian Diplomatic Talks Underway</h3>
<p>Four Issues Are the Main Topic</p>
<p>There Is Talk of Replacing the German Ambassador to Britain</p>
<p>[Rome] Prime Minister Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano, and German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop held talks this afternoon. The discussions focused on the following issues: ㊀ the operational status of the political axis between Germany and Italy, ㊁ the implementation of common policies by the two countries in Central and Eastern Europe, ㊂ the Spanish Civil War, and ㊃ Germany's request for the return of old colonies, and the reaction of the British side to this request. Observers generally believe that Germany's urging Italy to join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact is mainly motivated by its request to recover old colonies. It is learned that although Ribbentrop is scheduled to return to his country tomorrow, it may not be necessary to postpone his departure. Although the German side has denied the claim that he and German Ambassador to Italy Hassel will be exchanged, it has already been decided that Hassel will be transferred to London. (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>[London] According to reliable sources today, German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop may be recalled due to a dispute with British Foreign Secretary Eden. It is said that the British Foreign Office is quite opposed to Ribbentrop's various missions in Europe, such as his frequent trips to Rome for weeks at a time. Although the German side here has denied the above news, foreign diplomats generally believe it to be true. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Key to the Success or Failure of the Brussels Conference Lies with Japan</h3>
<p>Contents of the Application to Japan Announced</p>
<p>[Washington] American political figures generally express doubts about what the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can achieve. They all say that since sanctions and boycott movements have been put aside, the only key to whether this conference will not be a complete failure depends on Japan's attitude. In short, if all the goals of that country can be considered to have been achieved, it may accept mediation. Otherwise, it should insist on not yielding, and other related countries will not be able to make things difficult for it. As for Germany's mediation, since Germany has signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan, it has also lost its qualifications to mediate. (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Beijing It was learned today that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference almost faced the danger of indefinite postponement yesterday. Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of U.S. Chief Representative Davis alone, it was possible to pass a resolution to reopen next Tuesday and temporarily prevent the implementation of the proposal to dispatch mediation committees. It is said that Italy is very willing to participate in this committee. Davis was originally lukewarm, which caused Italian representative Macordi to leave the meeting. Davis was willing to propose that the meeting be reopened on Monday. At that time, France opposed it. Davis resolutely replied, saying that there is much work to be done in the future and it should not be a waste of time. Most of the representatives of small countries agreed with Davis's proposal, so it was finally decided to reopen on Tuesday. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Beijing Our country's chief representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Dr. Gu Weijun, met with a Central News Agency reporter in the afternoon of the 6th and issued a statement saying that the draft letter from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to Japan was passed at the meeting on the morning of the 6th. The letter invited Japan to participate in the meeting in order to exchange views with several important representatives, and to discuss the possibility of improving mutual misunderstandings and stopping the war between the two sides to achieve a peaceful resolution. He stated at the meeting that he did not oppose the policies adopted by the meeting or the goodwill of the representatives to improve the situation, but he retained the position that China expressed on the opening day of the Nine-Power Conference, that is, if mediation is to be adopted, it must be based on the obligation to implement the Nine-Power Treaty. He also requested that the draft letter inviting Japan to participate in the meeting must be fair and impartial, and that the content should include not only Japan's complaints, but also China's accusations against Japan. The representatives considered his suggestions to be fair and expressed their agreement. The draft letter was announced on the evening of the 6th. (Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Reply from Belgium to Japan</h3>
<p>The request from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Beijing, sent to Japan, has recently been voted on and passed by the plenary session and has been sent out. The full text is typed on four pages, divided into six paragraphs. It states that in its reply on the 27th of last month to Belgium's note, the Japanese government stated: ㊀ it has no territorial ambitions in China; ㊁ its actions in China do not violate the Nine-Power Treaty; ㊂ it has many grievances with China, all of which the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has noted. At the same time, the Chinese government also submitted a note stating that Japan had violated the Nine-Power Treaty, refuted Japan's accusations, and listed its grievances against Japan. "The Nine-Power Treaty contains provisions applicable to this situation. The discussions currently underway in Beijing are based primarily on these provisions, namely the method of full and frank communication among the contracting parties as stipulated in Article VII of the treaty. The purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to peacefully resolve disputes between the contracting parties. One party to the dispute, China, has already sent representatives to attend and is prepared to fully participate in the work of the conference. It is hoped that the other party will also come and cooperate. It is regrettable that Japan has not been able to attend." Japan's note also stated that holding a conference by a majority of countries to find a solution would only complicate the current situation further. Regarding this, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference believes that all contracting parties are qualified to exercise the rights contained in the treaty. All countries with interests in the Far East have been affected by the Sino-Japanese war, and the potential consequences of this war for international peace have been noted by countries around the world. Therefore, convening a conference to discuss the matter is appropriate. "Although the representatives of the participating countries believe that there is room for redress regarding the concerns expressed by the Japanese government, it remains to be seen whether the Japanese government is prepared to send one or more representatives to exchange views within the framework of the treaty with representatives of certain countries designated by the conference. The objective of this exchange of views is to clarify certain points declared by both parties to the dispute and thereby find a solution. Please provide a prompt response as to whether the Japanese government can accept the above arrangements." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Britain Willing to Help with Post-War Reconstruction in China</h3>
<p>International Nature as Principle, British Under-Secretary Answers Questions from Members of Parliament</p>
<p>[London] During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Mr. Smith raised the issue of assisting China in recovering after the end of the current Sino-Japanese war. Mr. Smith asked whether, if China needed financial assistance to recover after the end of the war, British influence would be used to ensure that such assistance was of an international nature and not to the benefit of any one country. Under-Secretary Lord Cranborne replied that the British government would continue to focus its efforts on ensuring that such assistance to China was not an issue of international competition, but a matter to be discussed, with China of course included.

<h3>Enemy Troops Landing at Jinshanwei Have Been Defeated and Retreating by Our Ambush</h3>
<p>Our Forces' Positions in Pudong Remain Solid, Bitter Battle at Baziqiao Yesterday, Lost and Regained</p>
<p>This newspaper received a front-line war report at 2:00 AM this morning stating: ㊀ After continuous reinforcements, the enemy landing at Jinshanwei reached nearly a brigade in strength. Yesterday morning, they attempted to advance from Zhalin, Songyin, Mishidu, and other locations to attack Fengxian, Minhang, Songjiang, and other strongholds in an attempt to cut off the rear of our Songhu forces. After our side dispatched elite troops to rigorously block them, the enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated south. Fierce battles are currently underway in the Songyin, Zhangyan, Tinglin area of Punan. ㊁ From 10:00 AM yesterday, enemy artillery units north of the Suzhou River heavily bombarded our positions in Chengeng and Beigongjiazhai, firing over 3,000 rounds. At around 5:00 PM, the enemy at Liujiazhai, under the cover of artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on the Beigongjiazhai position. Our side also used artillery to cover infantry charges, fighting a bloody battle until 10:00 PM, killing over 300 enemy soldiers. The enemy then retreated without support. ㊂ Yesterday afternoon, at 1:30 PM, enemy troops north of the river crossed the river from Houjiadai as reinforcements, but were repelled by our forces, killing over 80 enemy soldiers. However, the enemy at Wujia Ku launched a fierce flanking attack, and our troops at Zhangjiangdu and Qujiaqiao made a slight rearward adjustment. ㊃ Yesterday afternoon, at around 1:00 PM, the enemy at Gejiaxiang launched a fierce attack on our Chichuan position, but were bravely repelled by our forces. ㊄ Last night, at around 8:00 PM, our □□ regiment in the Jiangqiao town area, acting on orders, launched a successful attack towards the Xibang area and are currently in stalemate outside the Zhaiqiao Zhai.</p>
<h3>Enemy Landing in Hangzhou Bay Blocked by Our Forces</h3>
<p>Enemy Also Blocked Outside Xincang</p>
<p>According to military news, the enemy forces landed between Zhalin and Zhapu along the coast of Zhejiang Province and advanced north, but have been blocked by our forces. Fierce battles have occurred approximately four to five kilometers north of the Hangzhou-Shanghai Highway, and the situation there is stabilizing. According to reliable reports, the enemy landed in three locations successively on the 4th and 5th: approximately 300 troops at Caojing Town, and approximately 1,000 troops each at Jinshanwei and Quan Gongting. At that time, 500 troops advanced beyond the highway from Quan Gongting, but were blocked by our forces outside Xincang Town, approximately four kilometers to the north. A small number of enemy outposts advanced further north from Caojing, but were all repelled by our forces.</p>
<h3>Enemy Retreating South from Mishidu</h3>
<p>A military correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 12:45 PM on the 7th that the enemy forces landed in the Jinshanzui area, hoping to cut off the rear of our troops in the Pudong area. Therefore, after landing, they scurried northward. It is learned that a small number of enemy troops advanced to Mishidu on the south bank of the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, but after being attacked by our forces, they were forced to retreat south.</p>
<p>Further report, the enemy who landed at Jinshanwei in Punan are now advancing on two routes with the Yangtze River as their target. One route, from Caojing Town and Jinshanzui southeast of Jinshanwei, captured the towns of Tinglin and Yexie and went straight to Songjiang. The other route goes from Jin Siniang Bridge, Quan Gongting, along Songfeng Road, and Songyin Zhangyan straight to Mishidu, but all were blocked by the natural barrier of the Huangpu River. Our army is currently dividing its forces to encircle and suppress the enemy, strictly guarding Zhalin and Zhapu, cutting off the enemy's retreat, and launching a pincer attack from Pudong and Zhujing. Yesterday morning, the enemy's advance troops once attempted to attack Mishidu, but were severely attacked by our army in the vicinity and defeated to the south. Our army took advantage of the victory and advanced straight forward, and fierce fighting is still in progress.</p>
<h3>Pudong Positions Increasingly Consolidated</h3>
<p>After the enemy forces landed in the Jinshanzui area, Pudong appeared to be threatened due to the terrain, so there was a brief disturbance yesterday morning, and residents fled to Puxi. In fact, our military authorities have built strong fortifications at all important points along the Pudong coast, and it is impossible for enemy soldiers to land even a step. The enemy forces advancing to the upper reaches of the Huangpu River have also been blocked by our main force and cannot flee north, so there is nothing to worry about. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, we dispatched a large number of elite troops to reinforce the Pudong border, so the Pudong positions are now more consolidated than before.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Encircled at Liujiazhai Attempt to Attack Chenggen Without Success</h3>
<p>Attack Beigongjiazhai Again in the Evening, Over 300 Enemy Killed</p>

At the same time, the enemy troops north of the Suzhou River bombarded fiercely with artillery to cover the infantry's sneak attack, firing a total of over 3,000 shells. Our army vowed to resist and persisted with the enemy. Although the fortifications were slightly damaged, morale was not diminished. As a result, the enemy made no progress and retreated to the Liujiazhai position. At 5:30 PM, the enemy launched another fierce attack on Beigongjiazhai, and a bloody battle broke out with our army. Our army, under heavy artillery fire, disregarded life and death and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. By 10:00 PM, the enemy had been killed over 300 men, were wounded and retreated.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Shoot Down Enemy Balloon, Setting It on Fire</h3>

Baziqiao is our main stronghold, and the enemy is making every effort to attack it. Although our position wavered once last afternoon and night, we reinforced the counterattack and finally drove the enemy back. In addition, Zhangjiang Du, which controls the intersection of Zhujiabang and the Suzhou River, is also very important. We originally guarded the north of the bank, but we were threatened by the enemy, so we retreated to the south of the bank and confronted the enemy across Zhujiabang. The enemy used twenty-year-old field guns to bombard our entire line this morning because they had repeatedly failed to attack. The sound of the artillery was deafening, and it had not stopped at the time of reporting, with nearly a thousand shells fired.</p>

<p>At 2:00 PM yesterday, the enemy flagship Izumo fired three shots in a row at Pudong. An enemy ship moored outside the Tai Tong Wharf and fired heavily on the shore with heavy machine guns. At around 4:00 PM, a small enemy military boat carrying a dozen soldiers, with machine guns mounted and shielded by steel plates, sailed to the Yulong Wharf in Lujiazui and outside the Rihua Yarn Factory to reconnoiter. They then lingered at the stern of a British ship and used binoculars to look at the shore, but never dared to approach Pudong. After half an hour, they sailed downstream. Da Gong News reported that, according to people from Puxidong, the number of enemy ships in the Huangpu River suddenly increased this morning. From the Wusongkou to the Yangshupu area, there were no less than dozens of ships, with a large number of motorboats and sand boats parked alongside them, seemingly planning an attack on our Pudong positions.</p>

Central News Agency reported that three enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, Songpu Maru No. 13, Taotu Maru No. 116, and transport ship Iao, arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 7th) and berthed at Osaka Wharf and the North Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, unloading more than 2,000 boxes of ammunition and ordnance.</p>

<h3>Pudong Residents Cross the River in the Rain Yesterday</h3>
<p>Currently Being Resettled by Clansmen Associations</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the enemy has repeatedly attempted to land in Pudong, but has been repelled by our forces. Yesterday, because enemy forces landed on the north bank of Hangzhou Bay, rumors spread in the city, and Pudong residents flocked to cross to Puxi in small boats in the rain. From 10:00 PM the night before last to 6:00 PM last night, the wharves south of Chunjiang Wharf were jammed with refugees. In total, more than 20,000 refugees crossed to Puxi, accounting for a portion of the Pudong population. They have all been taken in by the Pudong Clansmen Association and various refugee shelters. Yesterday happened to be a day of continuous autumn rain, and the refugees were all wet and in a miserable state. Moreover, because there were many people and few boats, many people lost their footing and fell into the water in order to be the first to board the boats. At around 12:00 PM yesterday, a ferry carrying more than 30 refugees capsized when it sailed to the Huangpu River near the Taikoo Wharf due to overcrowding. Although foreign ships nearby sent lifeboats to rescue them, some were not rescued in time and drowned, which was truly unbearable to witness.</p>
<p>At around 1:00 PM yesterday, just as Pudong residents were moving to Puxi, a rowing boat, due to overcrowding, suddenly capsized and sank in the waters south of an Italian warship, throwing more than a dozen male and female passengers into the water at the same time. Two small motorboats were quickly dispatched from the nearby American and French warships to rescue eleven or twelve people, but two or three people tragically drowned and disappeared.</p>
<p>Another report, since the Pudong area has been ravaged and bombed by enemy aircraft, in addition to residents with slightly better living conditions who have moved to safe areas, there are still many poor residents who are trapped by their wealth or inconvenient to move. For some reason, they suddenly became flustered before dawn yesterday and fled westward in the pouring rain. By the morning, thousands of refugees had crossed the river in the rain and sought refuge in the concessions. The Pudong Clansmen Association had no less than a thousand people entering their doors in one day, and they all contacted the association and the relief association, and used several trucks to transport them to the shelters separately. Those who could not be sent were temporarily staying at the association, so that they could continue to be resettled today.</p>
<h3>Stray Bullets Fly in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Residents of Various Villages Fleeing Everywhere, Caojing Town Trying to Rescue Women and Children</p>
<p>Since our side retreated to the new position, the enemy army has repeatedly crossed the river and attacked, but all have been repelled by our army, and they have been unable to succeed in the end. Therefore, from the evening of the previous day (6th) and yesterday (7th), they concentrated artillery fire in the Beixin Canal and Zhoujiaqiao area, hoping to cover their troops to cross the river. Therefore, the sound of guns and cannons was as dense as a string of pearls, causing stray bullets to fly everywhere. A field artillery shell fell on Wangjia Xuan in Xinlonghua, setting fire to and destroying the ship and five houses near the market, injuring one farmer and killing one woman and one boy. A shell fell near Caohe Temple, a small steel cannon shell fell on Fantou west of the Meilong East section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, killing a 13-year-old boy and collapsing two houses. Stray bullets flew into the vicinity of the Caohejing West Town Jiangjia Tomb Mountain North and the south bank of the Yangjia Bridge, causing panic among the residents of various villages, who fled to safe places in cars, with old and young, carrying burdens on their shoulders, crowded on the way, the scene was miserable and unbearable to witness.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, Yang Xinzheng, a municipal committee member of the Caojing District in western Shanghai, and Luo Yinong, head of the defense regiment, have supervised the police and regiment to protect the area, sparing no effort. Due to strategic considerations, our army moved the position westward, no more than about 10 li from the town, causing it to be affected by stray bullets from time to time. In order to stabilize local order, they began on the 6th to first have Yang Jishi, Chen Xueyu and directors of the relief group escort the women, children, elderly and weak throughout the town to the Huimeng Primary School outside the Xinbei Gate of Shanghai for shelter, while urging all shops to operate as usual in order to maintain the market.</p>

<h3>British Consul-General to Xiamen, Marting, Completes Term and Returns Home</h3>
<p>Various Circles in Xiamen Hold Farewell Ceremony</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: British Consul-General to Xiamen, Mr. Marting, completed his term at the end of last month and returned home. Various circles in Xiamen, appreciating Mr. Marting's harmonious relationship during his four years in office, held a grand farewell ceremony and specially made a large red satin canopy in the ancient Chinese style, embroidered with the four characters "Promoting Friendship", to present to Mr. Marting as a memento. Before leaving, Mr. Marting expressed his feelings and impressions of his four years in Xiamen, saying, "As the Consul-General to Xiamen, I have spent four years in a flash. Recalling these four years, I am very happy to have been treated with sincerity by the Chinese people. The progress of Xiamen's undertakings in recent years has been remarkable. When I first arrived in Xiamen, gambling was rampant and caused the most harm. There were almost shootings every week. To eliminate this bad habit, cooperation between Chinese and foreign authorities was necessary. Most of those who opened gambling dens were overseas Chinese holding foreign nationality. After the sharp crackdown by the first mayor, Wang Gu Pan, the scourge of gambling was eradicated in less than a year. In terms of construction, there has been considerable achievement. The seawall reclamation project was completed four years ago, and most of the roads have been completed. The Xiamen-Gulangyu ferry has also been opened. Xiamen is the only port in southern Fujian, and ships of 10,000 tons can enter. The planned construction of the new wharf will make it a modern commercial port. In addition, with the realization of the Gaoqi-Jimei Bridge, its future as a major commercial center in China is immeasurable. Recently, due to the serious situation, commerce has stagnated and people's hearts are uneasy. Fortunately, the new mayor, Mr. Gao Han'ao, has shouldered the difficulties and gained the trust of the Chinese and foreign people of Xiamen and the reliance of the military authorities. This has gradually restored the sluggish market, and residents who had fled are returning to Xiamen in droves. I believe that under the leadership of Mayor Gao, with unity from top to bottom, the prosperity of Xiamen can be predicted."</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Move Back to Hongkou</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Strictly Enforce Curfew; Permits Required for Moving Property</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that the Japanese residents of this city who were previously forcibly repatriated are now returning to Shanghai one after another, settling in their former residences in Hongkou. However, according to an announcement made yesterday by the Japanese military headquarters in the Public Concession, restrictions on the movement of property, transportation, and curfew will continue to be strictly enforced without relaxation. Anyone wishing to move property from one place to another must still obtain a permit from the headquarters. Every night from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. the following morning, only those with night passes are allowed to travel on the roads. As for the curfew, it will continue to be strictly enforced. According to Japanese newspapers, Japanese-owned shops in Hongkou are gradually reopening for business. As of the 2nd of this month, a total of 1,549 Japanese residents had returned to the Hongkou district. Including those who returned on the 2nd, the total is approximately 2,400.</p>
<h3>British Authorities Consider Shipping Safety</h3>
<p>North Waterway of Great Keelung Safe; Changes to Be Notified Immediately</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that British shipping companies were notified yesterday by the British authorities that the issue of transport safety had been further considered by Admiral Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China. The Admiral's view is that since British ships and cargo ships sailing from above Great Keelung to the Public Concession or the French Concession's Pudong have never been hit by shells or bombs, navigation on this route is not significantly more dangerous than berthing near Great Keelung or in neutral waters. The authorities' views on navigation safety may need to be changed in the future, but if there are any changes, all shipping companies will be notified immediately.</p>

<h3>Diary of a War Correspondent (10)</h3>
<p>— By Chen Wanli, Special War Correspondent for the Central News Agency</p>
<p>In the last ten days of October, I experienced a few days of fresh and stimulating life. This has left a valuable page in my life history. Now, after completing my mission, I have completely escaped from danger, and recalling the past scenes feels very enjoyable. Here I will write down everything from the past as a supplement to my "Diary of a War Correspondent." Because in the past few days, I was initially completely under the control of enemy aircraft, and even the purpose of writing a diary was deprived. Later, I was busy with various fragmented matters after the transfer, coupled with a restless mood. The "Diary of a War Correspondent" was therefore interrupted. I am very sorry for this.</p>
<p>㊀ Before the Retreat</p>
<p>In this war of resistance, our sky was almost completely controlled by enemy aircraft. This is an undeniable fact. We had to wait until "the sun set in the west" before we could start our activities, whether it was building fortifications or mobilizing troops. Even artillery fire was no exception. Therefore, the enemy had twenty-four hours of activity time every day, while we only had twelve hours. As for the enemy's firepower being more powerful than ours and the enemy's mechanized troops being several times larger than ours, these are all facts that everyone knows. Under these circumstances, with the united strength of the whole country, under the leadership of the supreme leader, and with loyal and courageous soldiers fighting the enemy with their flesh and blood, we retreated from the first line of defense to the second line of defense only after two months and eighteen days. This is glorious for us. This is a victory for us. Because in our original plan, we planned to fight a bloody battle with the enemy for two months and then retreat to the second line of defense. Now, we have exceeded the scheduled time limit by eighteen days and inflicted significant damage on the enemy before retreating in an orderly manner to the first line of defense. Is this not the supreme glory? Is this not a great victory? But the regret is that we could have defended the first line for quite a long time if there had been no accidents, although this is truly asking too much of us.</p>
<p>The enemy's attack on the south bank of the Wenzaobang began after the retreat from the Liuhang area. Recently, the enemy on the south bank of the Wenzaobang (west of the Shanghai-Taiyuan Highway) launched a fierce attack on our Zoumatang line on October 23. On the morning of the 24th, the old Ren Bridge in the center of Zoumatang was broken through by the enemy. A certain commander stationed in Zoumatang reported to Commander-in-Chief × by telephone. The Commander-in-Chief ordered him to defend the position to the death and not to retreat without orders. However, after a short period of fierce fighting, they finally retreated. The speed of this retreat was truly an accident. On the evening of the 24th, our troops stationed on the south bank of the Wenzaobang (east of the Shanghai-Taiyuan Highway) were ordered to move to the west of the highway to block the enemy, holding the line parallel to Datang. At the same time, on the east of the highway, the main position was the Changzhong Road, with a warning line slightly south of Miaohang. The troops along the Shanghai-Taiyuan Highway also retreated to the Yaocuntang area to protect Datang. On this line of defense, we had quite strong fortifications, and we were prepared to inflict even greater blows on the enemy on this position. However, this was also unexpected. On the morning of the 20th, the Yaocuntang area was resolutely broken through by the enemy, causing them to infiltrate the left flank of the Datang position and shaking the entire line.</p>
<p>Although the Datang line was breached, our loyal and courageous soldiers continued to fight a bloody battle with the enemy for more than twenty-four hours. The intensity of the battle was truly "unprecedented." On the evening of the 26th, we used a small number of troops to hold the three points of Zhabei Pengpu and Zhenru, blocking the enemy's advance. At the same time, the remaining troops calmly retreated to the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, preserving their original strength. On the 27th and 28th, the troops stationed in Zhenru and Pengpu also retreated one after another. The brave soldiers who defended Zhabei to the death only withdrew from Zhabei at midnight on the 30th, shedding tears and obeying the orders of the Supreme Commander. From the start of the August 13th Shanghai Battle until now, we have fought bitterly with the enemy for two months and eighteen days, using fresh red blood to dye the most glorious page in national history.</p>
<p>㊁ Life Under Enemy Aircraft Control</p>
<p>From the 23rd onwards, there were always more than a hundred enemy aircraft over the Datang Zhenru and Beixinjing areas, bombing and strafing everywhere, without a moment's respite all day long. Even at night, the enemy troops continued to be active, with flares fired in the air, lighting up the night as if it were daytime. The purpose of the enemy aircraft's activities was, on the one hand, to try to eliminate our forces and, on the other hand, to try to stop our reinforcements.</p>
<p>A small village near Zhenru was the location of the headquarters of the ××th Army, which was also where I was staying. Thirty-four hours a day, it was almost completely under the control of enemy aircraft. Our two meals a day were at five o'clock in the morning and six o'clock in the evening, because this was the only time we had to be liberated. However, sometimes it was impossible to get even these two meals. We ate only one meal a day. The extent to which we were controlled by enemy aircraft can be clearly seen here.</p>
<p>I was completely under the control of enemy aircraft, and I lost my freedom of personal action, whether it was day or night. Bombs exploded around me, and machine guns strafed overhead. I spent almost the entire day hiding in the bomb shelter, feeling the threat of the iron birds at every moment. There was nothing I could do but "fold my arms and rise up," which was truly painful to the extreme. But seeing that everyone from the Commander-in-Chief down was still busy commanding operations and handling military affairs as usual, this moved me to the point of almost shedding tears. What I personally feared most was the strafing from aerial machine guns, because the machine gun bullets were dense, and the range was long. In addition, the firing line was diagonal, making it impossible to defend against. Besides this, I had a special reason for fearing aerial machine gun strafing, which was that on the morning of the 24th, right in front of my residence, a peasant woman was strafed by enemy aircraft. I witnessed the fresh red blood flowing from the honeycomb-like wounds. Thinking of this tragic scene now still makes me shudder. Secondly, what I disliked was the seemingly clumsy bombing aircraft. It could drop bombs in a grand manner, without even bending down. This was the so-called horizontal bombing. It was silent and casual, and it also made people feel a sense of being caught off guard. As for light bombers, I didn't care about them at all later.</p>
<p>Completely under the control of enemy aircraft, I spent four whole days. The eight characters "uneasy in sleep and food" and "days like years" can be said to have fully described life under enemy aircraft control. During the day, even eating was not free, and at night, even sleep was not peaceful. I spent almost the entire day living in the basement. Sometimes, I ran out of the basement, only wanting to get a chance to stretch my back and rest, but I would immediately hear the buzzing of heavy bombers flying overhead. Either there were dense machine guns strafing in the air, or heavy bombs were exploding nearby, immediately driving you back into the basement. It was truly "uneasy in sleep and food," and it was truly "days like years." But now, looking back, this kind of life was quite fresh and stimulating. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Record of a Week of Fierce Fighting on the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>Since our forces, due to strategic considerations, voluntarily shifted the right flank and central route to the Suzhou Creek, this once-quiet river has instantly become a military stronghold, the very first line of defense in our Shanghai-Songhu resistance. Because of its importance and the convenient transportation around its basin, it has become even more of a military center.</p>
<p>There, we have built very solid fortifications and equipped them with a strong military force. If the enemy dares to try, we are sure to give them a severe blow and a crushing defeat, perhaps even annihilation. This has been proven by many past events. Although we have also made considerable sacrifices in the past, sacrificing ourselves for the country, in order to fight for the survival of the nation and to eliminate the only enemy of the Chinese nation – Japan, no matter how many warriors we sacrifice, how much innocent people's blood is shed, how much of our construction and everything else is destroyed, it is worth it, we are willing, it is great and magnificent!</p>
<p>On the morning of October 31st, thirty or forty enemy soldiers, while the morning mist had not yet dissipated, began to move on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, carrying out their first attempt to cross the river stealthily, and as usual, under a barrage of artillery fire, they released smoke screens and attacked our Zhoujia Bridge. At that time, our defending soldiers of the ×th Division, who were hiding on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, were waiting in strict formation. Watching this group of enemies set up canvas bridges and crawl on their knees, they could not help but smile silently at each other. But when the enemy approached, there would be no forgiveness. They immediately used the pre-arranged fire network to densely strafe the approaching enemy. Therefore, in less than an hour, this group of enemies had been completely annihilated by us and buried at the bottom of the river, and the canvas bridge became our trophy. On this day, the enemy never dared to invade again.</p>
<p>At midnight on the 31st, which was the morning of November 1st, at two or three o'clock, presumably the enemy soldiers had deeply felt that our Zhoujia Bridge fortress was heavily guarded and its tiger-like power was difficult to overcome. Therefore, they changed their plan and sent six or seven hundred soldiers, under the cover of smoke screens, from Chenjiadu, Majiazai, Panjiagang, Houjiadai, and Huajia Bridge to make a second stealthy crossing and attack our positions in Liujiazai, Beixinjing, Qiaojia Bridge, Wujiaku, and Tingtou. At that time, our soldiers immediately divided their forces to intercept them. Our mortars, flat-trajectory guns, light and heavy weapons, and hand grenades fell on the enemy like dense raindrops. Although the enemy tried their best to resist and massively reinforce, after several hours of our fierce bombardment, the enemy finally could not hold out and was completely repelled by us from Chenjiadu, Majiazai, Huangjiazhai, and Panjiagang. At the same time, because several of the enemy's only river-crossing tools, the canvas bridges, had been destroyed by our shells, a significant number of enemy soldiers fell into the river and drowned. Their corpses along the riverbank were not even dragged back; later, our brave soldiers buried them. In this battle, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and losses, and also sent our soldiers many gifts. Therefore, they soon used much-needed artillery fire to bombard us directly, as if to vent their anger. But our position was still solid and intact. At four o'clock that evening, which was the morning of the 2nd, the enemy forces once again stirred in the above-mentioned places, but in the end, they were still driven back by our loyal and brave soldiers. Afterwards, there were some contacts, but these were skirmishes. Our artillery fire never stopped for a day, and many shells hit the enemy's important strongholds. But unfortunately, our regimental commander died heroically from serious injuries while personally directing the front line that day. This is our loss! But the regimental commander was honorable and heroic. At the same time, it is said that two other regimental commanders were also seriously injured and are now being treated. I am very sincerely praying for them here, hoping that they will recover soon and continue to kill the enemy!</p>
<p>On the evening of the 2nd and at dawn on the 3rd, the enemy soldiers abandoned their previous plan and suddenly shifted their troops westward, making another stealthy crossing at the intersection of Houjiadai, Huajia Bridge, and the east bank of Shenjijiabang on the Suzhou Creek, attacking our Yaojiazhai, Tingtou, and Wujiaku. It is estimated that their force was about 2,000. At the same time, on the Liujiazai side, across the river from Chenjiadu, 300 to 400 men also forcibly landed. At that time, our defending forces in the above-mentioned places, seeing the rampant enemy forces, immediately dispatched troops from Wujiaku, Tingtou, and Yaojiazhai on three sides to surround the enemy and gradually suppress them. Our troops in Liujiazai also rose up to engage the enemy soldiers from Chenjiadu. At that time, the artillery fire in both places shook the entire Shanghai, with shells falling like rain and flesh and blood flying everywhere. Enemy planes even assisted in the battle in the sky. Under that arduous struggle, our army still managed to annihilate many enemies. After eight or nine hours of fierce fighting, the enemy forces on the Liujiazai side were first resolved by the Northern Army. More than a hundred enemy soldiers, because their retreat was blocked, fled into nearby Western-style houses and factories, where they were of course still surrounded by us. However, some of the enemy soldiers were very clever and immediately knelt down and surrendered, but there were also thirty or forty who stubbornly resisted, and they were gradually eliminated. The enemy forces in Wujiaku and Tingtou, because of the unremitting siege by our troops in Yaojiazhai, Zhangzhai, and Caizhai, had lost almost all of their advance troops and began to flee in panic. However, the enemy's rear route had not been cut off, so they were reinforced by more than 700 men that afternoon and attacked again, building fortifications there and densely covering them with barbed wire, as if they intended to use it as a base. Our army preemptively took action. Immediately, they used fierce and concentrated artillery fire to bombard the enemy's position. The enemy stubbornly resisted with their backs to the river, and a fierce battle broke out at eight o'clock that evening. However, our army was determined to die, advancing wave after wave, and persevering. By about ten o'clock in the afternoon, our troops on the right flank had recaptured the eastern half of Wujiaku, and soon the western part of Tingtou was also recovered by our troops on the left flank. However, there was still a portion of the enemy that had not been eliminated.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 4th, just as our army was advancing north to search for the remaining enemies, unexpectedly, a large number of enemy reinforcements were also crossing the river at that time, estimated to be about 3,000. At that time, the soldiers of our two battalions, although they had encountered difficulties, still bravely charged into the enemy's position, killing and wiping out the enemy as if they were in an uninhabited area. The enemy's formation was completely broken through by our army, so both sides entered a retreat. All artillery fire completely lost its effectiveness, and it was all a battle of bayonets and flesh and blood, the intensity of the fighting was unprecedented. Soon, our rear reinforcements joined the battle and surrounded all the enemy forces on three sides, attacking and suppressing them fiercely. Seeing the precarious situation, the enemy forces also urgently requested reinforcements, rushing back and forth between Yaojiazhai and Caizhai, trying to break through. Our artillery fire closely bombarded the places where the enemy soldiers were entrenched, fighting until the evening of the 4th. A small part of the enemy forces broke through the encirclement and fled to Tianduzhai and Yujidun, but after being ambushed by our army, they still scurried back to Wujiaku and Tingtou. At midnight on the 4th and early morning on the 5th, our army and reinforcements launched a counter-offensive, relying on our superior street fighting tactics to gradually drive the enemy away. By six o'clock in the morning on the 5th, the enemies in Yaojiazhai, Zhangzhai, and Caizhai had been completely eliminated by us. However, Wujiaku and Tingtou were still in the hands of the enemy, and they were still adding fortifications and stubbornly resisting. In this battle, both sides suffered heavy losses. Our army captured one enemy anti-aircraft machine gun, three light machine guns, more than twenty Type 38 rifles, more than a dozen gas masks, and countless bullets and hand grenades. These many trophies have been transported to the rear and stored. I think that when we celebrate National Day next year, we can use these many enemy gifts to build several commemorative arches to commemorate our soldiers who fought in the resistance.</p>
<p>At four o'clock on the morning of the 5th, the enemies in Wujiaku and Tingtou again sent heavy troops to attack our positions in Yaojiazhai, Zhangzhai, and Caizhai. Their artillery fire never stopped for even a second, so our fortifications suffered some damage and were broken through by them. At that time, our soldiers guarding Baziqiao, Tianduzhai, and Jiangjiazhai immediately advanced forward, cutting off the enemy soldiers in Caizhai, Yaojiazhai, Zhangzhai, and Nuedunqiu into several sections, surrounding and killing them individually, thus forming a mixed battle situation again. The battle continued until that afternoon, and our position had not changed. Moreover, on the south bank of Zhujia Creek, a strong military force was reinforced to prevent the spread of enemy forces. This time, the enemy's losses and deaths were probably two or three times higher than ours, but their heavy weapons still could not be transported across the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>At the same time, the enemy forces in Chenjiadu, at eight or nine o'clock that morning, took advantage of the natural smoke screen, rain, and fog to stealthily cross the river to reinforce Liujiazai, and while building fortifications, they scurried towards Chi Circle and Xuejiaku. Our reinforcements arrived on time, and both sides launched a bloody battle in this area. Our communication was once disrupted, but it was soon restored. By dusk, it was raining heavily, and our loyal and brave soldiers risked the rain to fight desperately, getting their clothes completely soaked. In the end, they drove the enemy out and maintained the original front line. At two o'clock on the morning of the 6th, the enemy reinforced and attacked again. Their purpose, of course, was still to seize our positions in Beigongzhai and Chi Circle, but they had already encountered our sharp resistance. I am afraid that they would still be working in vain, simply increasing a few units on their list of deaths.</p>
<h3>Refugee Camp in Nanshi Expected to be Established Today</h3>
<p>The Public Security of Nanshi is Still Maintained by Our Police Security Corps. The People of Nanshi are Reassured and the Shops are Open as Usual.</p>
<p>The specific measures for the refugee camp in Nanshi, which is being carried out by people from various countries, have been finalized, and it is expected that it will be signed and established today. People from all walks of life are paying close attention to this. From now on, the public security there will still be maintained by our country's police and security corps. As for the armed forces, there are no garrisons in Nanshi, so there is no so-called withdrawal. After hearing the news that the refugee camp will be established, some residents have moved back from the concession. Although the enemy authorities once threatened to bomb Nanshi on a large scale, due to the opposition of people from various countries and the establishment of the refugee camp, although enemy planes occasionally go to reconnaissance, there have been no bombing raids. Therefore, the people of Nanshi are very reassured, and order is gradually being restored. Most of the shops in the Fangbang Road area have resumed business as usual.</p>
<p>The *North China Daily News* reports that the non-combatant safety zone in Nanshi, which was established by the International Red Cross Refugee Relief Committee, has been approved by both the Chinese and Japanese authorities, and is now being arranged in a state that satisfies all parties concerned. The committee is chaired by Father Jacquinot. After a meeting yesterday, it announced that it hoped to arrange everything properly within two days. The Nanshi Police Department is still responsible for maintaining public security in the area, and the committee will send personnel to monitor the implementation of the plan approved by both China and Japan and report to the committee every day. This plan is the responsibility of four foreign committee members, all of whom are expatriates from the International Settlement and the French Concession.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Overseas Chinese War Service Corps Returns to China</h3>
<p>Mechanical Automobile Experts and Technicians. The Second and Third Batches will Return to China in Two Weeks.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, the government has been in great need of various specialized talents, and overseas Chinese have returned to their motherland to participate in front-line service. The Philippine Chinese have been very concerned about their motherland. Since hearing that the government had recruited specialized personnel from various places to return to China and participate in the war of resistance, they immediately formed the "Overseas Chinese Returning to the Country Service Corps." Among the overseas Chinese living in the Philippines, more than forty specialized personnel and technicians have signed up to participate, and they have all reported to the consulate to complete all the procedures for returning to the country. They are scheduled to depart in three batches. The first batch is mechanical automobile experts and technicians, including Lu Tiesheng, Wang Ruoding, Deng Qingting, Li Zuze, Zhang Changjian, Cai Pei, Shi Xingxiu, Ding Jindin, Weng Wenhua, Zhang Yiguo, and 15 others, have returned to China on the Dutch ship Zisaga Nuo. Today, they can transfer to the capital, report to the central government, and wait for the military authorities to assign them to serve on various front lines. According to the overseas Chinese who have arrived, the second and third batches will be equipped with various experts and can return to China in two weeks. It is also said that since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance in our country, overseas Chinese everywhere have heard of it and are united against the enemy. Overseas Chinese merchants have long been saving money and raising funds for the long-term war of resistance. If the government orders overseas Chinese to return to the country to participate in the war, then overseas Chinese will be happy to serve their motherland.</p>

<h3>Rescuing Under the Rain</h3>
<p>The Red Swastika Society rescue team, in the drizzling rain last night, teams one and two and the entire stretcher team set out, rushing to the front line in various directions, rescuing under the rain in ×× and other places, rescuing a total of eighty-four wounded soldiers, and one injured civilian woman, and sending them to various hospitals of the society for treatment.</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Defense Corps Rescue Team's rescue work has mostly focused on the rear in the past. Recently, it has changed its plan and decided to go to the front line for rescue every day. Yesterday, the entire team of more than 3,000 people, led by team leader Xu Fenghan, set out to the Chenjia Bridge Zhoujia Bridge area of the front line, venturing deep into the position to work under the rain. The team members are all in the spirit of service. Although the enemy's shells continue to fall nearby, they remain unmoved and are still busy with rescue work. From 6:00 p.m. that afternoon to 4:00 a.m. the next morning, a total of more than eighty wounded soldiers were rescued and sent to Zhongshan Hospital by the team's ambulance.</p>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Association Anti-Enemy Support Association, since resuming the rescue of wounded soldiers on the front line, its efforts to serve are commendable, and the achievements of its work are also clear to everyone. In order to promote the work, three trucks are specially dispatched every day, rain or shine, to the front. However, all the team members are now suffering from illness due to overwork, but they are still in good spirits and continue to work as usual to fulfill their duties.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou Raises Funds to Relieve Refugees</h3>
<p>A Total of 10,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou, chairman of the First Special District Citizens' Federation, deeply felt the lack of winter clothing for the tens of thousands of refugees in Shanghai as the weather became colder and the number of sick people increased. Therefore, he raised 4,000 yuan from the Continental Bank, 4,000 yuan from the Siming Bank, 2,000 yuan from the Farmer-Worker Bank, and 500 yuan from the Tonghe Bank, totaling 10,500 yuan, and delivered all of them to the Charity Relief Association yesterday to be used for the needs of relieving refugees.</p>
<h3>Yan Huiqing Convened an International Research Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing the Nine-Power Treaty and the Shanghai Issue, etc. It was Resolved to Continue Holding Meetings Once a Week.</p>
<p>Ambassador Yan Huiqing, President of the International Problems Research Association, believes that there are many public and private organizations in Shanghai that study our country's current diplomatic problems. In order to seek collective wisdom and benefit, he specially invited representatives of various important organizations, as well as celebrities and experts in the diplomatic world, to hold a small group research conference at the International Hotel at 4:00 p.m. yesterday.

<h3>The Child Welfare Association is Doing its Best to Take in Refugee Children</h3>
<p>Since the China Child Welfare Association established a refugee children's shelter in the war zone and started taking in children, the number of people has reached more than 150. In addition to providing them with daily rations, they also provide them with appropriate education. According to Mr. Chen Tiesheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Association, the war is now expanding, and the violent enemy is indiscriminately bombing all day long. Many children are displaced and have no one to take care of them because their parents were brutally killed. The number is large, and they are currently looking for a suitable address, a shelter that can accommodate thousands of refugee children. All children without parents aged from six to fourteen will be given shelter and rations as much as possible.</p>
<h3>The Third and Fourth Squads of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Disaster Relief Association Rescue Corps will Depart for the Front</h3>
<p>— (Photographed by Qichang)</p>

<h3>The Situation in Shanxi</h3>
<p>The situation in Shanxi is now indeed very serious. Since tens of thousands of enemy troops launched a general offensive on our entire line from the Northeast South Road on the 28th of last month, although they have encountered fierce resistance from our army at every turn, they have finally penetrated into the near suburbs of Taiyuan recently. Taiyuan is the only remaining political and economic center of importance north of our Yellow River. Now it may not be able to avoid being baptized by artillery fire. How this city will fare depends on the results of the bloody battle that our hundreds of thousands of troops and civilians are currently fighting against the violent enemy.</p>
<p>Judging from the overall situation, Taiyuan may fall into enemy hands sooner or later. However, we do not need to sigh for this reason. The glorious battles of the various Shanxi armies in the past have given us considerable satisfaction. Those heroic troops are still scattered throughout the mountainous areas of the province, ready to inflict heavy blows on the enemy at any time. Even if Taiyuan is unfortunately lost, the troops and civilians throughout Shanxi must clench their teeth and continue to fight the enemy to the death in the dangerous mountains. Moreover, the enemy has already suffered unexpected sacrifices and losses in the battle to attack Taiyuan, and it is not certain how successful they will be in the street fighting in Taiyuan City afterwards.</p>

<h3>On "Economic Reciprocity"</h3>
<p>— Sun Huairen</p>
<p>Recently, Undersecretary of State Welles of the United States said: "The United States firmly believes that its principles for improving the international economy, if emulated in the Far East and adopted everywhere in the world, will certainly help solve the current problems." Then he said: "Recently, US Special Envoy Davis said that the Far East issue contains economic components, and at the same time, he declared that the United States advocates using these economic components as a prerequisite for resolving the war, which is based on the above-mentioned belief. Apart from this, the United States has no other practical suggestions." From this conversation, it can be seen that the United States currently seems to want to put up a sign of "economic reciprocity" to mediate the Sino-Japanese war in the Far East, which is very obvious. This kind of argument in the United States may be without malice, but we cannot deny that the United States has been poisoned by Japanese propaganda.</p>
<p>The idea of so-called international economic reciprocity, although it has had a rather long history since it was advocated by many liberal scholars, we cannot but admit that in this era when fascism is rampant, that classical idea of international economic reciprocity has indeed been declared dead. In other words, in this murderous world today, to talk about international economic reciprocity again can be said to be out of touch with reality. Regarding this point, the United States should really have a factual lesson. The failure of the 1933 World Economic Conference to succeed as the United States had hoped is not exactly saying that there is no real reciprocity in this world?</p>
<p>Originally, the term "economic reciprocity," just like the term "freedom," is a good term when used properly, and it becomes a sin when used improperly. In this world, true international economic reciprocity has become a wreck, but invaders can still use "economic reciprocity" as a guise for aggression. This time, the Sino-Japanese war is indeed our fault in Japan's view, saying that we cannot cooperate with it in politics and economics, but is this really the case? Putting aside the political aspect for the time being, let's just talk about the economic aspect. After the fall of the Northeast, we also talked about economic cooperation, tolerated humiliation, shamefacedly established trade associations, and politely came to the match-making joint venture. There are countless things like this. Can we still say that we do not have economic reciprocity with Japan? Now, Japan has deployed 500,000 troops on Chinese territory and started a military invasion, and we have started a sacred national war of resistance that we can no longer tolerate. Under these factual circumstances, if "the Far East issue contains economic components" and "these economic components are used as a prerequisite for resolving the war," and if Japan's economic reciprocity is used to end the war, is this not obviously a wrong observation?</p>
<p>To be honest, in Japan's mind, the economic reciprocity that it can be satisfied with is to call China an economic slave of Japan. Therefore, the economic components that the United States calls the prerequisites for resolving the war and that Japan can agree to, unless it is to call us to give in to being slaves, but I dare say that every Chinese with blood is intolerable. Therefore, we can very sincerely tell our friendly country, the United States, that in this Sino-Japanese war, there is no question of "economic reciprocity." When Japan's aggression does not stop, the so-called "reciprocity" is nothing more than Japan's "sole benefit." We do not deny that our economy is indeed very backward, and we are also very sincere in having genuine economic reciprocity with any country in the world, but in order for us to get genuine "reciprocity," all friendly countries should first support us and let us overthrow "pseudo-reciprocity." If the United States is going to suggest "economic reciprocity" in this Sino-Japanese war, it is really nothing less than destroying its own beliefs in the international economic principles, so that genuine international economic reciprocity will never be revived.</p>
<h3>Loan of 40,000 Yuan for Difficult People's Reclamation</h3>

<h3>The Hu Wenhu Brothers' Enthusiastic Donation</h3>
<p>National Salvation Bonds Subscription of 500,000 Yuan</p>
<p>And a Large Donation of Rescue Medical Supplies</p>
<p>The prominent overseas Chinese figures, the Hu Wenhu and Wenbao brothers, are extremely enthusiastic about supporting the country's all-out war of resistance. They have subscribed to national salvation bonds for a total of 500,000 yuan. As a standing committee member of the National Salvation Bond Fundraising Association, Hu personally departed to various ports in Malaya to discuss methods of subscribing public bonds with wealthy Chinese merchants. According to Hu, after the principal of the public bonds is repaid in the future, the funds will be used to run charitable and cultural undertakings and will not be recovered. This can also be advocated by overseas compatriots. Furthermore, Wanjin Oil and other medicines produced by the hall are urgently needed by the soldiers at the front and the refugees in the rear. The Nanjing Health Department, the city's慰勞 Committee, and the Women's慰勞 Sub-committee have sent letters and telegrams requesting donations. Hu Guigeng, the manager of the Shanghai branch of the hall, relayed them one by one. Hu immediately donated a total of forty cases of Wanjin Oil and Bagua Dan, two cases of Wanjin Oil Essence, catgut sutures, quinine cream, and other items, which have all been delivered and handed over to the Health Department for distribution to the North China and East China war zones. In addition, Hu purchased a large quantity of medicine, cotton, gauze, and other first-aid supplies from London and shipped them to Hong Kong for transfer to the front.</p>
<h3>Dutch Ship Chinese Seamen Resign to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Refuse to Transport Munitions to Japan</p>
<p>158 People Return Home</p>
<p>The Ziliwang, a wheel of a Dutch shipping company, travels to various ports in Java, Shanghai, and Japan. Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, it has been loaded with large quantities of military materials from various parts of the Dutch East Indies to Japan. Seventy-five Chinese seamen on the ship refused to fuel the enemy's ferocity and aggression against their motherland and collectively resigned in Surabaya. The company reported the detention of all seamen to the local police and used various methods to force them to resume work. Among them, fifteen people would rather be shot than yield. This matter was reported in this newspaper. Later, my Deputy Consul Chen in Surabaya came forward to negotiate, but there was no satisfactory result. Subsequently, my Consul-General in Batavia reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and formally protested to the Dutch government. The company apologized to our consul, and the fifteen Chinese seamen who had been detained were also released. They have now returned home on the Zilikala. Since this incident, it has aroused the public anger of all the Chinese seamen employed by other ships of the company. To express their firm refusal to transport military materials to the enemy country and their unwillingness to indirectly fuel the enemy's aggression against their motherland, 158 Chinese seamen serving on the company's Zishun Dali, Zhimoluo, Zhijindi, and Zhibade have all resigned at the same time and returned home on the Zilikala. Although they sacrificed their jobs, they did not hesitate.</p>

<h3>After the Recovery of Songyin and Zhangyan, the Enemy Counterattacked Fiercely Last Night</h3>
<p>Our Armies' Encirclement and Suppression of the Stubborn Enemy is No Longer a Concern</p>
<p>The Enemy's Several Attempts to Cross the South Bank of the Suzhou Creek Were Repelled</p>
<p>We are Holding Our Original Positions from North of Jiangqiao Town to Zhuyuan</p>
<p>The enemy who landed in Jinshanwei has indeed reached more than one brigade. Their forward outposts passed through Zhangyan and Songyin and reached Mishidu, attempting to cross the Huangpu River, attack Songjiang, and cut off the rear of our Shanghai garrison. We urgently dispatched reinforcements to encircle and flank from the left and right, while holding the natural barrier of the Huangpu River in the front. After three days and nights of bloody battles, the enemy's advance has been frustrated. According to the front-line battle report obtained by this newspaper this afternoon, after we cleared the stubborn resistance in Mishidu, we took advantage of the victory to pursue them. The two important strongholds of Songyin and Zhangyan were successively recovered yesterday afternoon. Last night, the enemy launched a large-scale counterattack. For a time, artillery fire roared, and the battle was fierce. They are still engaged in fierce battles in the vicinity of Zhangyan. As for our army that crossed the river from ××, its fierce attack on the enemy's right flank was extremely successful. Our ×× army encircled the left flank in separate routes. The overall situation is very encouraging. On the south bank of the Suzhou River, although there was a heavy rain yesterday, hand-to-hand combat between the two sides continued day and night. This morning, the weather cleared, and enemy planes were active again. The artillery fire was extremely fierce along the line from the Fanhua渡 Station to Zhoujiaqiao. Our heavy artillery also bombarded the enemy's positions. The enemy has been repeatedly repelled in their attempts to cross the river since dawn. As for the area south of Chenjiadu and near Beigongjiazhai, the enemy continues to reinforce. The enemy and we are still confronting each other across Xiaobin. The fierce fighting on the Zhujia浜 side has not stopped to this day. Our fresh troops are arriving in a steady stream. This line can be firmly defended. As for the line from north of Jiangqiao Town to Zhuyuan and Guangfuzhen, we are holding our original positions, and the enemy has not dared to invade easily.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 7th: The enemy entrenched in Quan Gongting and Jin Si Niang Bridge launched an offensive toward Jinshanwei, Caojing, Zhangyan, Huangdai, Songyin, and Xincang after reinforcements arrived on the 6th, advancing northwest. After our army blocked them head-on and attacked from both sides along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway from Tuolin and Zhapu, the enemy's retreat route was cut off on the morning of the 7th, and they were surrounded on all sides. We are annihilating them separately and it will not be difficult to completely resolve them in a short time.</p>
<h3>Our Army Launches a Three-Pronged Encirclement of Enemy Troops in Southern Pudong</h3>
<p>Songyin and Zhangyan Recovered in Succession</p>
<p>Simultaneous Flanking Attacks from the Left and Right Wings</p>
<p>The enemy that landed in Jinshanwei advanced north in an attempt to threaten Songjiang. Its reconnaissance troops, with isolated forces, went deep into the area and reached Mishidu on the shore of the Huangpu River via Zhangyan. The enemy divided its forces and advanced toward Tinglin and Yexie. Over the past three days, enemy forces have continued to reinforce, and the number of landings is estimated to be six to seven thousand. Yesterday, our army advanced rapidly in the heavy rain and suppressed the enemy forces in separate routes. The enemy forces that reached Mishidu were only a small number of forward infantry. After our army met them head-on with a heavy blow, the enemy at Mishidu retreated south. Our position along the Huangpu River is extremely solid, and it is difficult for the enemy to cross. Yesterday morning, our elite troops launched a fierce attack on the right flank of the enemy forces from □□. At the same time, fresh troops from □□ and other places also rushed to flank the left wing of the enemy forces, repelling the enemy near Xincang. The fierce battle of encirclement on three sides was very intense. According to a report from the front, our army made rapid progress last night and forced the enemy forces to retreat. After Songyin was recovered last night, Zhangyan was also recovered in succession. However, the enemy's forces were stubborn and still planned to resist. At the moment, Songyin and Zhangyan are all in fierce battles. It is difficult for the enemy to gain a foothold in this narrow and protruding position. After our army's vigorous attacks on all routes, annihilation is not far away.</p>
<h3>Full-Scale Artillery War on the South Bank of the Suzhou Creek This Morning</h3>
<p>Significant Increase in Enemy Troops in the Liujiazhai Area</p>
<p>The Enemy Attempted to Cross the River Again on Zhongshan Road</p>
<p>Although the south bank of the Suzhou Creek was fiercely contested yesterday in the heavy rain, our army in the western section is still firmly holding the Zhujiazhai. The position is extremely solid. Although the enemy forces repeatedly attacked the Baziqiao, they were bravely repelled by our army. In the eastern section of Liujiazhai, the enemy continued to cross the river in the heavy rain yesterday, and the number greatly increased. They launched a fierce attack on Beigongjiazhai. Our army defended firmly along Xiaobin. In order to connect the east and west lines, the enemy forces attacked Zhangjiadu and Qujiaqiao. After our army's counterattack, only a small number of enemy forces were able to sneak in. This morning, the two armies were still engaged in fierce fighting north of Lincoln Road and Piers Road. Because the weather cleared up, both sides' artillery teams were extremely active. On Zhongshan Road, the enemy forces seemed to have intentions of crossing the river. Our artillery fire is concentrating on that point and bombarding them fiercely. Therefore, in addition to the infantry battle on the entire line, the artillery battle is also unfolding simultaneously.</p>
<p>Our Artillery War Against the Enemy in Caojiazhai</p>
<p>Central News Agency, accompanying army reporter reported at 12:50 PM on the 8th: After the enemy successively crossed the river and reinforced in Liujiazhai, they launched a fierce attack south. Chen Geng, our important stronghold north of Lincoln Road, was destroyed by enemy artillery fire. Today, the battle shifted to Caojiazhai, south of Lincoln Road. The enemy first bombarded us with artillery fire at 4:00 AM this morning, and we also returned fire and bombarded each other. At dawn, the enemy immediately launched an infantry attack, and enemy tanks also prepared to cross the river. Our artillery team destroyed their pontoon bridge. The fierce battle lasted until about 9:00 AM, and the enemy had suffered about 300 casualties. The battle is still in progress.</p>
<p>We Killed 400 Enemies in Zhangjiangdu</p>
<p>Central News Agency, accompanying army reporter reported at 12:50 PM on the 8th: At around 2:00 AM this morning, the enemy again crossed the river in the darkness in the area of Zhangjiangdu and Qujiaqiao. Our army had already detected it and immediately counterattacked in two routes. The enemy was caught off guard and annihilated by us, reaching 400 people. The remnants retreated to Caijiazhai and other places. It is expected that there will be more intense battles this afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Pudong Remains Stable</h3>
<p>The Rumor That the Enemy Army Will Launch a Large-Scale Offensive is Not True</p>
<p>However, the Migration of Refugees is More Numerous, and Ferries are Forcefully Raising Fares</p>
<p>The situation in Pudong remains stable and there is absolutely no change. The rumor that the enemy army will launch a large-scale offensive is not true. According to the current situation, Pudong is no longer a must-contested place militarily. Moreover, the enemy army is currently focusing all its efforts on western Shanghai and the north bank of Hangzhou Bay. All the troops in Shanghai are distributed in the currently occupied positions and still feel stretched. Even if they divided their forces to attack Pudong, there were only intermittent machine gun sounds on the Huangpu River last night. Other than that, it was unusually quiet. This morning, three enemy planes flew low over various places to reconnaissance, but did not drop bombs. The reporter inspected the streets in the morning, and the order was unusually quiet. However, the number of migrants is more numerous than yesterday. Large and small ferries on the Huangpu River are forcefully raising fares, increasing the fare for each passenger from ten copper coins to one dime. Refugees are complaining endlessly, hoping that the police authorities will promptly take strict measures to maintain the restricted fare of ten copper coins to provide relief.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Attempts to Invade Jiangqiao Town</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, accompanying army reporter reported at 12:50 PM on the 8th: The enemy army has a pattern of launching a full-scale offensive against our Jiangqiao Town. This morning, at around 4:00 AM, large groups of enemy troops were active from Zhuyuan, Guojiazhai, Lujiaxiang, Lijiaxiang to Jishan Temple. According to our reconnaissance, we have taken strict precautions.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Active This Morning</h3>
<p>Nanshi: Two enemy bombers flew over the Gaochang Temple riverside docks in Nanshi around 8:00 AM this morning. They first strafed with machine guns, then dropped two bombs, one of which exploded, the other did not, but there was no damage. Enemy aircraft also dropped two bombs on Zhoujiadu, across the river from Gaochang Temple. Around 9:00 AM, two enemy aircraft continued to fly back and forth over the area, and at 9:15 AM, another bomb was dropped, creating a loud explosion. At the same time, two more enemy aircraft circled over the southern Huangpu River from Damatou to Gaochang Temple from early morning until noon, occasionally strafing with machine guns, causing civilian boats to avoid ferrying passengers. Therefore, the Gaochang Temple ferry boats did not carry passengers this morning, with only small boats risking crossings. At 9:20 AM, enemy aircraft flew over the Shanghai military camp and strafed with machine guns, injuring a woman on Guohuo Road, who was rescued by a fire brigade ambulance and sent to the hospital for treatment. This morning, the area from Bansongyuan to Gaochang Temple was bombed with five or six bombs in total. Road traffic was temporarily stopped by the militia to avoid danger.</p>
<p>West Shanghai: From 6:30 AM this morning, enemy aircraft were very active, especially towards West Shanghai, with an estimated twenty to thirty aircraft, all bombers. However, apart from a small number wreaking havoc along the Suzhou Creek, the rest went towards the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. Around 7:00 AM this morning, several enemy aircraft flew over the British garrison in West Shanghai, where they were repelled by British anti-aircraft fire and warnings, but they flew over several times later.</p>
<p>Pudong: This morning, the weather cleared up, and enemy aircraft flying out of Yangshupu and Wusong unleashed their power again. At 6:01 AM, enemy aircraft first took off from Yangshupu, with a team of three giant heavy bombers, followed by five teams in succession. At the same time, enemy aircraft from Wusong also took off one after another, all flying south along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway via West Shanghai. Around 7:00 AM, three reconnaissance aircraft were very active, flying over Pudong, Lan Ni Du, Zhoupu, Nanshi, and the Bund, circling for about fifteen minutes. Around 8:00 AM, one enemy aircraft returned to the skies over Nanshi for a second reconnaissance. At 8:30 AM, two more enemy aircraft flew out of Yangshupu, followed by three teams of heavy bombers, flying over Zhabei, the Public Concession, and Nanshi to the west end of Xinjing in northwest Shanghai. By 9:00 AM, the first batch of enemy aircraft had completely departed. In three hours, an estimated forty enemy aircraft had flown out. Afterwards, two or three aircraft at a time continued to fly back and forth.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Transporting More Artillery</h3>
<p>Around 4:00 AM this morning (8th), two enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, No. 270 Guangyou Maru and Ganli Maru, sailed into Shanghai and docked at the Huangpu Wharf and the China Merchants Bureau's central pier, unloading fifty to sixty large and small cannons, as well as a large number of bullets. The Jiagutuo Maru, which sailed into Shanghai yesterday afternoon and docked at the China Merchants Bureau's central pier, began transferring the large quantities of military supplies it was carrying into the transport ship Ganli Maru after 9:00 AM this morning. It is said that the ship will sail to Jinshanwei in Hangzhou Bay to supply the enemy troops there.</p>
<h3>Enemy Red Cross Ship Returns to Japan with Over a Thousand Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>The enemy Red Cross ship Harnde Maru (No. 380), which sailed into Shanghai yesterday morning (7th), unloaded a large quantity of medical supplies and then loaded enemy ashes and over a thousand wounded soldiers that night, setting sail for Japan at 5:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Refugee Zone to Be Implemented Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Expanded Area Occupies One-Third of the Old City, All Measures Detailed This Morning</p>
<p>The refugee zone in Nanshi, initiated by the Shanghai International Committee and the Chinese Red Cross, has been thoroughly discussed for several days and finalized this morning, with all measures agreed upon and decided to be implemented from tomorrow (9th). According to those involved, the initial boundary of the refugee zone was set to end west of Anren Street, but after consultations with various sectors, it was deemed too small. Therefore, it has now been decided to expand it to the west of Xiaobeimen. The detailed area is south of Minguo Road, north of Fangbang Road, east of Fangbang Bridge, and west of Xiaodongmen, bordering the northern, eastern, and western parts of the French Concession, and the southern part of Fangbang Road, which runs east-west through the old city, occupying about one-third of the old city area. It has been decided to implement it from Tuesday (i.e., tomorrow), regardless of whether there is a signing or not. Security will still be maintained by the existing Nanshi police. Nanshi has never had troops stationed there, so there is no question of "withdrawal." The Shanghai International Relief Committee has obtained a membership permit from the municipal government and can go to the refugee zone for observation. The flags displayed in the refugee zone are the flags of the Chinese Red Cross and the Shanghai International Relief Committee.</p>
<h3>Japan Fears "Boycott" (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wutlai from Utley, USA</p>
<p>Anglo-American Economic Weapons Can End the War</p>
<p>Most till the land for landlords owning fifty or more mu of land, handing over more than half of the rice harvested each year to the landlords as rent. The landlords do not provide seeds, fertilizer, or capital. There are also farmers who own their own land, but although they can cultivate and harvest themselves, they have to pay extremely high interest rates on borrowed capital, so they are equally distressed. In short, almost every Japanese farmer is heavily in debt.</p>
<p>This feudal social and economic relationship still exists today, resulting in a very narrow domestic market. The rural people are extremely poor, and even when agricultural product prices are high, they are unable to accumulate capital to purchase machinery and innovate farming methods. This has led to a disproportionate industrial development, solely at the order of the state, operating export industries on a large scale using modern technology, such as textiles, as well as the manufacture of munitions. As for most domestic industries, they consist of just one owner and a few apprentices, sometimes with a few "runners," relying on manual manufacturing or using very little mechanical power.</p>
<p>The lower middle class, such as small landlords who exploit high interest rates, small industrialists, merchants, and artisans, are extremely numerous. They are all desperately poor and hate the industrial and commercial monopolists who control raw materials, loans, and foreign trade to the bone. High interest rates and a narrow domestic market make it impossible for small businesses to become prosperous, no matter how hard they work. Japan does not have middle class people who invest large sums of money. The capital in the country is controlled by a few zaibatsu families such as Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Yasuda. Although those with an annual income of over 1,200 yuan have to pay income tax, in 1931 only 569,046 people paid income tax. Only 20,524 people had an annual income of 5,000 yuan or more. The average income per person is about 800 yuan. However, there are twenty people with an annual income of between 300,000 and 1.5 million yuan. Only 730,000 people paid business profit tax, and all businesses with an annual net profit of 200 yuan or more had to pay this tax.</p>
<p>Although this concentration of capital makes it easier to pool the nation's income during wartime than in a country with a large middle class, it also makes Japan's social system extremely unstable in times of crisis. Farmers hate landlords and those who exploit high interest rates (who are actually agents of banks), and small industrialists and merchants hate the zaibatsu, creating a real volcano. The Japanese ruling class often uses propagandistic campaigns to prevent it from erupting. Since 1931, the authorities have turned social resentment into support for aggression against China, seizing Manchuria at one stroke and using the empty hope that Manchuria's future prosperity would bring the people supreme happiness to win over the people and prevent their rebellion. However, they have discovered that conquering China is not an easy task, and the people, whose belts are getting tighter every day, cannot tolerate the pain of a long war. It is conceivable what will happen then. Japan has gained nothing from occupying Manchuria, but has only increased the burden on its people. Japan now hopes to annex North China without a real war, but this will not provide any relief to the farmers and lower middle class. You cannot cure a poisoned person by stuffing their stomach with food. Japan's social structure has too many illnesses that cannot be cured by new colonies. There is a lot of wasteland in Manchuria, which is perfect for immigrants to cultivate, but only a few hundred Japanese farmers have gone to Manchuria. The Japanese government has not provided capital for immigrants to enter Manchuria, and this huge sum of capital will never be obtained as long as the Japanese zaibatsu and warlords hold power.</p>
<p>The danger today is that Britain only seeks to protect its investments in China before Japan tramples on China, and is afraid of the long-term effects of the war on Japan. Therefore, it will pressure the Chinese government to submit, even though the Chinese army has not been defeated. However, the vast majority of the Chinese people are determined to resist to the end, which is a real thing. The Chinese army has shown extraordinary courage and determination in Shanghai. Now, if Britain and the United States work together to boycott Japanese goods, China will almost certainly be able to defeat Japan. The current British government will never initiate economic pressure on Japan, because the British government wants to see the Japanese ruling class remain in power, and hopes to negotiate a bargain with Japan while pressuring China to cede the five provinces of North China to Japan in order to protect its investments.</p>
<p>However, if the United States decides to boycott Japanese goods and invokes the Neutrality Act to prevent selling goods to Japan on credit, the British government will have to take the same action as the United States. This move will be supported not only by the Liberal and Labour parties in Britain, but even by some parts of the Conservative Party. If the United States does not righteously help China for moral or electoral reasons, it may be motivated by the fact that one of Japan's main ambitions in North China is to turn North China into a large cotton-growing area, so that it will no longer have to rely on American cotton. Indeed, for the sake of the long-term interests of American cotton planters, it is worth boycotting Japanese silk for a few weeks. The interests of the United States in China, in terms of investment scope, cannot be compared with Britain, but in terms of commercial scope, it cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Japan's finances were much stronger in 1922 than they are now, but at that time, Britain and the United States worked together and easily forced Japan to spit out the occupied territories in China. Therefore, if Britain and the United States exert political or economic pressure on Japan today, there is no reason to fear that the United States or Britain will be drawn into a war. Britain and the United States can end the war simply by hinting at cooperation to implement economic pressure on Japan. The United States was able to make Britain's policy consistent with its own in 1922, so why can't it do so in 1937? (Translated from the New York Nation)</p>
<h3>Fu Zuoyi Commands Garrison to Defend Taiyuan to the Death</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] After the fall of Zhangde, the Chinese army is now retreating to the Baolian Temple line, ten miles south of Zhangde. Fu Zuoyi is still commanding the garrison of Taiyuan, fighting the enemy and determined to defend the city to the death. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Li Rensheng Accused of Embezzling Refugee Food</h3>
<p>Rented House to Store Rice and Sell It Continuously, Prosecuted for Embezzlement After Secret Report</p>
<p>Recently, there have been widespread rumors in the city about a director of a shelter embezzling refugee food and privately enriching himself. After investigation by reporters, the perpetrator of this incident is Li Rensheng (age 27) from Ningbo, who used to work in a bookstore at No. 154 Yuyuan Road. After the Shanghai war, he was introduced by Shen Binhan, director of the relief group of a charity organization, and sent to serve as the director of the Xinshi Shelter on the south side of the Shenyuan Ball Field. Unexpectedly, Li rented a back room in a living room from a Shi family at No. 3, Lane 196, Xiejiao Lane, on October 8, with a monthly rent of seven yuan. After renting the house, Li stored 50 bags of rice, worth about 669 yuan, in the room and sold it continuously. Recently, someone secretly reported to the General Patrol House, saying that the stored rice was obtained by Li by embezzling refugee food. Hua Detective Zhang Mingde and detectives Huang Fusen and Zhou Kaiwen investigated and arrested Li, and handed him over to the First Special Court last Saturday. The Patrol House lawyers Zhang Shizhu and Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for embezzlement. Because the Patrol House is currently investigating where Li sold the rice, the case has been postponed for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Stalin Inspects Red Army at 20th Anniversary of Soviet Revolution</h3>
<p>Two Million People, Hundreds of Tanks and Airplanes. The Main Objective of the Celebration is Still Domestic Affairs.</p>
<p>[Moscow] The most important event in today's celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution was Stalin's grand review in Red Square. Two million people participated, including demonstrators and soldiers, as well as hundreds of tanks and airplanes. Defense Minister Voroshilov gave a speech, which was met with thunderous applause, stating that the Red Army exists for national defense and that the soldiers of the Red Army are protectors of civilization, but if attacked by the enemy in the future, they will respond with unprecedented offensive warfare. After Voroshilov finished his speech, 30,000 people sang the Internationale in unison, including many representatives from various countries and Outer Mongolia. During the parade, the masses displayed satirical images of Japanese, Italian, and fascist rulers on banners. However, the main themes of this celebration are still important domestic events such as the elections under the new constitution. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Situation</h3>
<p>German Mediation Hopeless, U.S. and France in Agreement</p>
<p>[Berlin] The initial negotiations for Germany to mediate the Sino-Japanese War have no prospect of progress for the time being. Although political circles in France are very optimistic about this matter, it is heard that the Japanese conditions are extremely harsh. After the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, it is even more necessary to doubt whether Germany is absolutely fair and impartial. The Chinese side has also pointed out that Germany and China have not signed a similar agreement, and that General Chiang Kai-shek has achieved considerable success in the many years of anti-communist warfare. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Brussels: The representatives of the countries of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference are now quietly awaiting Japan's reply, or taking a temporary break, or continuing to meet with each other. U.S. chief delegate Davis and French delegate Tedeschi had a long talk today. It is now believed that the two have mostly the same views on the problems of resolving the Far East dispute by peaceful means. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Random Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>The Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy was signed the day before yesterday, and it is said that it contains secret clauses. Yesterday, the Soviet Union celebrated the 20th anniversary of its revolution. Lu Changxu encouraged the soldiers, saying that we have repeatedly replied to the belligerent elements, telling them that although we do not want war, we are not afraid of war. According to this situation, no matter what, a second world war can hardly be avoided. However, the line of the Second World War is naturally the opposition between the camp of peace and the camp of aggression. Therefore, whichever camp is large will be victorious, and whichever camp is united and consolidated will be dominant. Now the camp of aggression is shouting, jumping, blatant, and united, while the camp of peace is mostly fearful, shirking responsibility and perfunctorily. This situation can already be seen in the Nine-Power Treaty meeting. But the more you want to shirk responsibility, the more you may not be able to shirk it, and the more you want to perfunctorily, the more you may not be able to perfunctorily. Because now it has reached the final juncture, it is not the time to shirk responsibility and perfunctorily.</p>

<h3>On the Way to the Front (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent's Communication from the Central News Agency, Shiheng</p>
<p>Coming out of the wounded soldiers' hospital, it was just past noon. According to the fixed plan, we went to visit an old missionary who had been preaching in this local area for more than 30 years at a nearby American Gospel Church. Readers may wonder why we still have the free time to watch this kind of person that is generally called a "religious parasite" at this time. Well, I would like to take this opportunity to explain some of my thoughts.</p>
<p>In recent times, the cultural workers of our country's intellectual class, from the standpoint of anti-imperialist cultural aggression, have given the most painful attacks to these missionary pastors who are the vanguards of aggression. Of course, no one can defend their preaching itself. Perhaps they are unconscious, but their enslaving education and religious superstition have indeed become tools of imperialist cultural aggression. However, we cannot forget their long history in the Chinese mainland and the close feelings they have with the average Chinese villagers after many years of living together. Although they are in the position of pastors, they are also unconsciously assimilated by the Chinese people. Their love for the average villagers is not entirely due to their hypocritical religion.</p>
<p>In the current period of national resistance against Japan, these pastors have their uses. Their external statements will be the best international propaganda. Moreover, among the pastors of various countries in the mainland, in addition to their religious mission, many still serve as correspondents for foreign newspapers in various places. Let’s talk about the pastor Peng that Mr. Chen introduced me to. In order to gain the trust of the Chinese people, the pastors in the mainland have all changed to Chinese names. He is the correspondent for a certain local mainland newspaper. A few years ago, when a group of American journalists came to Xuzhou, he introduced them to the local news media. Moreover, after the start of our country's resistance against Japan, he also sent a letter to the American ambassador stationed in Beijing, pointing out the inappropriateness of the initial attitude taken by the United States towards the Sino-Japanese war. There must be many such experienced pastors scattered throughout China. I think that if we give them assistance and encouragement from the side, it will achieve more results than letting them always do it automatically.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pastor Peng and two or three of his colleagues went to the countryside. We unfortunately did not meet.</p>
<p>Along the way, we also visited General ×××, the commander of the ××th Army Group who had newly stationed here. I will not describe his heroic posture here, nor will I praise the talents of the place. I am sure we will have opportunities to praise him in the future. He described that the Chinese soldiers have already developed extremely strong self-confidence in the resistance war. The certainty of final victory is deeply hidden in his heart and revealed in his eyes. This is the most profound impression that this visit left me.</p>
<p>That night, we waited for the train at Xuzhou Station from 7 o'clock until 4 o'clock in the morning, when the sky was about to dawn, the northbound train finally arrived.</p>
<p>When the train traveled to the Linyi area of Shandong, it was already the morning of the next day.</p>
<p>At 8:30, before arriving at the Jiehe Station not far from Yanzhou, the train stopped advancing due to an air raid alarm. The passengers got off the train to avoid it, and the train left the platform and hid in other places.</p>
<p>Following the crowd, I ran to a small village about half a mile east of the station and sat in a dry haystack room. First, I heard two bomb explosions in the distance. Then the plane circled in the sky above my head and dropped an egg. The sound was very loud, and my heart was shaking violently. Everyone guessed that this time, it must be somewhere not far from the train stop.</p>
<p>After lurking for a long time, people gradually gathered and sat under a big tree outside the village, chatting and waiting for the air raid alarm to be lifted.</p>
<p>I don't know where or when a peanut vendor appeared. He made an unexpected business. The travelers gathered under the tree all bought some to eat from him. He was a peasant of about forty years old, with an honest and loyal look on his face. He can be said to be a typical northern farmer. He weighed the peanuts and muttered,</p>
<p>"I won't give you less, elders. We just fled, so we don't dare to deceive people anymore."</p>
<p>"Where did you flee from?"</p>
<p>"Cangzhou."</p>
<p>"Do you still remember the situation in Cangzhou in the past?"</p>
<p>"How can I not remember? The ×× army opened the canal, and now it's all water, in order to block the Japanese soldiers. How can that block them? But the Daoci battle was fought very well, it was really 'officials and soldiers as one'."</p>
<p>"How did you escape?"</p>
<p>"Following the steel armored vehicles of the soldiers."</p>
<p>"Did the soldiers want you to sit?"</p>
<p>"If not, how can it be called 'officials and people as one'? The common people are doing their best to accommodate them, and they are very polite. But the common people are also worthy of them. When I was there, I sent them food every day. This time the war is very different from the previous Zhifeng and Zhizhi wars. At that time, no matter where the soldiers went, they couldn't find a ghost. This time, the common people themselves are willing to work for them, and they can get whatever they want. If you want to live in my house, just live in my house. If there is no white flour to eat, just make do with whatever you have." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Commander Yang Upholds the Inspection of Commercial Goods, Officers and Soldiers Are Not Allowed to Obstruct</h3>
<p>If Anyone Dares to Violate, They Can Be Named and Told</p>
<p>Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Command, after following the telegram order of the Commander-in-Chief to set up a passport registration and inspection office, requires that the transport of goods from organs must be released with a passport, while ordinary commercial goods are released with a certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to facilitate them. Now it is heard that some staff members are still not fully aware of this, and there are also cases of obstructing commercial goods with a certificate from the Chamber of Commerce. For example, at 2:30 PM on November 5, Liu Xiaozhang intercepted commercial goods at the entrance of the Maochang Optical Shop in Laobeimen. On the 6th, he detained the tools of Ban Zhengxing Iron Material Works at the same place. Also on the 5th, the personnel of the Nanshi Rice Market Wharf and the office in Chang Rice Company detained 100 jars of local yellow wine with tax bills and certificates from the Shanghai Liquor and Tobacco Tax Office, and even detained Zhu Suihua, the manager of Wansen Gong Liquor Workshop. Also on the 6th, Xin Cheng Coal Company was obstructed when transporting one ton of coal with a certificate. All of these are inappropriate. They were sternly ordered to follow the telegram order of the Commander-in-Chief in the future and not to obstruct the transportation of commercial goods in order to maintain rear production. If anyone dares to deliberately obstruct, it is hoped that the affected businesses will provide the address, date, and soldier number to tell the truth so that they can be punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Works Hard</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, according to a letter from the All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, requested to strictly supervise the staff to work actively. The reply stated, "In reply, we received your letter instructing us to strictly supervise the staff to actively step up their work, etc. Since the start of the War of Resistance, the work of this association has been several times that of peacetime. We have ordered the staff to actively work hard and have never made any mistakes. Before receiving your letter, we will naturally forward the instructions to encourage them to work harder to comfort our thoughts. We hereby reply for your reference."</p>
<h3>Laboring Class Salvation Association Sends Telegram of Condolences and Encouragement</h3>
<p>The Chinese Laboring Class Salvation Association yesterday, according to the resolution of the conference, sent a telegram to comfort General Chiang Kai-shek and all the anti-enemy soldiers, and sent a circular telegram to the whole country to unite and mobilize to resist to the end. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to General Chiang: To General Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Committee of Nanjing, and to all the anti-enemy soldiers, The enemy is rampant and invades our territory. Fortunately, Your Excellency led the division to rise up and fight against the enemy. The plan was devised and won thousands of miles away. The generals and soldiers are loyal and patriotic, and the whole people are moved. Today, the National Laboring Class established a Salvation Association in Shanghai. After deliberation, it was decided to send a telegram of condolences and encouragement, and expressed that they would pledge to be the backbone. Please, The Presidium of the Chinese Laboring Class Salvation Association Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Long Peiyun, and Shui Xiangyun, respectfully.</p>
<p>Circular telegram to the whole country: To all newspaper offices, to all laboring class organizations throughout the country, and to all laboring class compatriots: The enemy's disease is getting deeper and deeper, and the national disaster is getting more and more urgent. At this time of full-scale resistance, we rely on the united mobilization of the whole country, contributing all material, labor, and financial resources to the country. In addition to striving to step up production and enrich the war supply, our laboring class should also be united in arms, defending the country with blood and heads, and striving for the independence and survival of the nation and the country. The fish Japan Association has officially established in Shanghai. After deliberation, it was decided to send a circular telegram to the laboring class throughout the country to unite, mobilize, sacrifice everything, and resist to the end. I hope you will see it. The Chinese Laboring Class Salvation Association respectfully.</p>
<h3>War Zone Relief Corps First Distributes Relief in Pudong</h3>
<p>Taicang, Jiading, and Kunshan Counties Also Nearing Completion of Investigations</p>
<p>Due to continuous rainy weather and the approaching cold, the Shanghai War Zone Relief Corps, recognizing the hunger and cold suffered by refugees in the war zone and their urgent need for relief, is actively investigating the disaster situation in various war zones to begin relief efforts. According to a Xin Xin News Agency reporter, the Pudong district has completed its investigation, and the corps has appointed Lu Bohong to oversee the relief work. Relief personnel, appointed by Lu, are scheduled to depart on the 9th, starting with relief distribution in the Gaoqiao area. The Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan area will also complete its investigation within days, and representatives from the three counties will proceed to administer relief together.</p>
<h3>Two Children Kidnapped on Way to School</h3>
<p>Under Strict Investigation</p>
<p>At 8:50 AM today, a kidnapping occurred at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hardoon Road. It is reported that the kidnapped were two sons of Yuan Shuainan, residing at a certain number on Fuxu Road and Hardoon Road, one eleven years old, the other's age unknown. At the time, the two children were on their way to school and were kidnapped at that location. At the time of this report, Tang Jian, the Chinese detective of the Jing'an Temple Police Station in charge, was conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Orders Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to Regulate Shanghai Grain Supply</h3>
<p>Supervise Various Rice Industry Groups in Handling</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Food Regulation Committee believes that with the new rice harvest entering the market, Shanghai rice merchants are rushing to purchase from the interior, ensuring no shortage of food for the city. After the eighth committee meeting of the committee resolved to conclude operations by the 7th of this month, in addition to announcing the conclusion with Announcement No. 10, the decision was reported to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The bureau immediately instructed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, (omission above) stating that since the Chamber is the highest leader of commercial organizations and the Food Regulation Committee has concluded its work, the Chamber should be responsible for supervising the various rice industry groups in the city to properly handle matters related to food supply in the future. The chamber should comply with this order.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rice Merchants Rush to Purchase from the Interior</h3>
<p>Grain Reserves Increase, Ensuring Food Supply</p>
<p>Shanghai has a large population, and the monthly food supply requires approximately 100,000 dan. Therefore, Shanghai grain merchants always strive to purchase and store as much grain as possible. In this extraordinary period, the ability to ensure the food supply is due to sufficient reserves. According to reliable investigations, current reserves total 600,000 dan, enough to meet needs for half a year. Recently, although the war's westward shift has caused occasional transportation difficulties, the authorities of the Chinese Concession have made every effort to dredge the transport channels, allowing normal transport to continue. According to a Xin Xin News Agency reporter, this year's agricultural production in China has been bountiful, and the new grain harvest is now entering the market. Shanghai rice merchants have been rushing to purchase from the interior in order to acquire and store large quantities. Therefore, the supply of rice to Shanghai will steadily increase, reserves will certainly increase further, and there is absolutely no need to worry about food shortages.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation Establishes Solicitations Committee for Comfort Activities</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation Comfort Committee for Soldiers Fighting Against the Enemy has been very active in organizing comfort activities. The committee believes that as soldiers fight more fiercely, the public's comfort movement should also continue to advance. Therefore, the committee has resolved to invite enthusiastic people from all sectors of society, as well as all attending representatives from the committee's district branches, to form a solicitations committee responsible for handling all matters related to solicitations. Appointment letters were distributed yesterday, announcing the establishment of the committee.</p>
<h3>Youth Production Cooperative Strives to Relieve Refugees</h3>
<p>To provide relief to refugees, the Youth Boy Scout Corps used their funds to establish a Youth Production Cooperative, enabling refugees to sell domestic goods and daily necessities (known externally as the August 13th Refugee Sales Group). The profits earned are used to support their livelihoods. Since the trial operation, it has been very effective. Therefore, the cooperative has decided to expand its scope of service, adding shoe-shining and craft groups, aiming to make further contributions.</p>
<h3>Record of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Charity Federation</h3>
<p>Passed Measures for Relief and Land Reclamation for Refugees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association held its eighth standing committee meeting at the Renji Hall at 4 PM yesterday. Attendees included Qu Youliu, Huang Ruzhi, Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, Lu Bohong, Wang Binyan, Tao Mengqing, Wang Yunwu, Ji Mei, Xie Jiaqian, Gu Junyang, Qian Jingping, Zhang Binghui, Wu Kaisheng, Lou Zhaonian, Yin Guanzhi, and dozens of others. The meeting was chaired by Qu Wenliu, with Zhao Chengong as the recorder. First, the chairman reported on the committee's establishment, the Relief of War Zone Refugees Committee, and its past efforts to relieve refugees. Next, the following resolutions were passed: ㊀ The Design Committee of this association submitted the proposed measures for transplanting refugees to reclaim wasteland, which was referred by the fourth plenary committee meeting. The question was whether to approve the measures. "Attached measures" were approved. ㊁ With the westward shift of the war front, refugees are becoming increasingly crowded. As of the end of October, the association has only 117,456.99 yuan remaining in relief funds. Given the current situation, this is only sufficient for ten days. The question was how to proceed. The resolution was to make every effort to solicit donations. ㊂ Committee member Zhao Jinqing proposed that the spread of lung disease in the concessions has been exceptionally rampant recently. He has joined various charity groups to establish lung disease hospitals to provide relief. He proposed that this association also take on part of the work. The resolution was to share equal responsibility with the municipal relief effort and work together to advance the effort. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>
<h3>Victory is in Our Grasp</h3>
<p>— Liu Yucai</p>
<p>This invasion of China by Japanese imperialism can be said to be terribly out of touch with the times and to overreach its capabilities. It only knows how to rely on the rigid continental policy of Prime Minister Tanaka to forcefully seize Chinese territory. In reality, it is creating its own ultra-fast self-dug grave of utter defeat. We can prove this from the following points:</p>
<p>One, the military preparedness of various countries on the Pacific Ocean is becoming increasingly consolidated: the dramatic increase in the Soviet fleet. From these two aspects alone, Japanese imperialism is already in a precarious state and deeply fears the total destruction of its economic market that has been entrenched in North China for many years. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, it launched a preemptive strike, stirring up war clouds, hoping to sweep across North China in one breath and then peer into Central China, using this to consolidate its military base in North China and indirectly defend against the covetousness of other countries.</p>
<p>Two, Japanese imperialism also feels that the number of young soldiers in the country is increasing year by year. Under circumstances where there is absolutely no way out, these hotheaded young military figures are jumping around restlessly. Of course, their goal is for the young soldiers to occupy positions in military and political affairs. However, in order to implement this goal, they have no choice but to externally invade, making the current military figures impotent, old, and senile, and unable to handle the task. The faction of young soldiers takes this opportunity to rise up, shoulders the mission of invading China, and at the same time attempts to gain an important position in the military.</p>
<p>Three, because of the above two factors, and not daring to openly advocate for launching troops to invade China, the Japanese military authorities used the policy of deceiving the people with phrases like "China is Japan's lifeline" and "China is our source of gold" to confuse the minds of the Japanese people, while actively preparing for war and massively invading with military force. However, this kind of policy of deceiving the people by Japanese warlords has actually failed fundamentally. The people in Japan are filled with complaints, especially Japanese merchants who bitterly abhor the measures of their military authorities, causing foreign trade to plummet. Secondly, there is the unanimous opposition from regular soldiers within Japan. According to the Japanese military orders in peacetime, if three military orders are not issued, they can be immediately executed on the spot. This time, the military issued as many as eight military orders, summoning regular soldiers to go to China as tools of aggression. Under a united front of unanimous disregard, the regular soldiers resolutely defied these eight orders. The military authorities' policy of deceiving the people, which had been working hard, was completely destroyed at this point. At the same time, fearing that it would arouse resentment from the domestic people, and even cause riots! They dared not impose even the slightest punishment, only holding it in their hearts, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out.</p>
<p>Four, since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao incident and the subsequent start of the Shanghai Battle on August 13th, the international community has been in pain, and public opinion in China and abroad has criticized it based on reason. Under this situation of unanimous condemnation, the Japanese military authorities, feeling scorched and battered as they stumbled everywhere, realized that if they did not seek external assistance, they would become increasingly desperate and exhausted. Therefore, the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan was concluded in this situation. While using anti-communism as an outward pretext, it is actually a collection of aggressive fronts. This point we must recognize clearly. This is the Japanese bandits' remedial measure for self-recognized failure, but in fact, it conversely promotes powerful international sanctions.</p>
<p>In summary of the above points, we clearly confirm that the inevitable defeat of Japanese imperialism is a foregone conclusion. In addition, the economic foundation of Japan, due to its continuous invasion of China and the expansion of military expenditures, has been fundamentally collapsing. The situation of the people being poor and the wealth being exhausted means that it cannot but be defeated. On the other hand, from the standpoint of China's resistance, we can further prove from the following points that we have the certainty of victory:</p>
<p>One, China is a peace-loving country that has never wanted to easily provoke war. Our leader, Chairman Chiang, has long said: "We will never abandon peace until there is no hope for peace, and we will never lightly speak of sacrifice until the moment of ultimate sacrifice." Japanese imperialism provoked incidents in the Northeast on September 18th, occupied our three northeastern provinces, and again started war in Shanghai on January 28th, devastating our prosperous Zhabei district. We endured it, enduring such tragic injuries with patience and determination. How could we have known that the Japanese bandits would be insatiably greedy and then provoke a sudden invasion at Lugouqiao? This is when we have reached the point where we can no longer tolerate it. Peace has been despaired of, and the moment of sacrifice has also arrived. Our entire country unanimously exerted the self-defense force of resistance to fight the enemy to the death. This is the unanimous demand of the people across the country, and its power is extremely strong. History tells us that in a war, victory belongs to the side that is supported and assisted by the people. Now, 450 million people across China are united in the consistent spirit of all-out resistance, under the guidance of the government and the supreme leader. With this power, it can be believed that there is full confidence in victory.</p>
<p>Two, at the same time, most peace-loving countries around the world, seeing such a brutal robber who, after invading China, will further attempt to conquer other countries, also righteously condemn the Japanese, giving direct and indirect heavy blows to the Japanese bandits in spirit and in material. Ask yourself: on our side is the conscious and vigorous resistance of the people across the country, while on the enemy's side is the unreliability of the policy of deceiving the people, which will lead to internal strife. On our side is the sympathy and support of most countries in the world, while on the enemy's side is the temporary collusion of robbers engaging in looting. Comparing these situations, anyone can clearly see that our steps are day by day moving onto the bright road to victory.</p>
<p>Three, on the other hand, we can see that the economic bankruptcy within Japan and the resentment of the people against the military's reckless war flames are sufficient to make the enemy deal with thorny issues, directly and indirectly affecting the unsustainability of the invasion of China. We are cooperating with it with a long-term resistance strategy, which is precisely giving it a precursor to an accelerated failure. We see that Prime Minister Konoe's policy of advocating for a quick victory is even more revealing of their internal panic.</p>
<p>Four, the Japanese bandits' ambition for aggression is not only to conquer China, but also to conquer the world, with the intention of controlling all countries, which is the purpose of the so-called continental policy. But in fact, what is being created is a suicide policy. Aside from temporary collusion with those who share the same ambition for aggression, no other country will be coerced by you. Even Korea, which has been conquered by the Japanese bandits for a long time, has seen latent revolutionary forces now rising up. Their groups, such as the Comrade Society and the National Association, have unanimously united to resist Japanese imperialism, destroy the chains of oppression, and take the same steps as us to overthrow Japanese imperialism and restore Korea's independence and freedom. At the same time, they are also annihilating the robbers of world peace. This is precisely erecting a new force of the world's small and weak nations to resist Japanese imperialism. The world's peace-loving nations will continue to rise up and jointly punish this aggressive robber. The result of this blow. The defeat of Japanese imperialism is purely a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>People across the country, arm yourselves unanimously to launch the power of all-out resistance, and overthrow the world's robber, Japanese imperialism! The final victory belongs to us.</p>
