<p>時評</p>
<h3>歐洲外交局勢的轉變</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>最近歐洲的外交局勢。是在逐漸轉變之中。這種轉變的局勢。扼要說來。是表現於下列的幾點。㊀北歐各中小國家看到中歐局勢的紛擾不定。危險萬狀。正在進行一種局部的團結。力圖自保。這從本年初所謂波羅的海集團的醞釀。與最近奧斯洛協定的訂立。可以得到證明。㊁在西班牙的戰爭中。德意的武裝干涉。現在大致已告失敗。照最近的情形看。德意雖然不能死心塌地。靜觀叛軍的崩潰。但由於海岸監察辦法的施行。它們的武裝干涉的態度。必不能像原來的明目張膽。㊂德國不僅在西班牙方面失敗。在中東歐方面。也受了許多挫折。芬蘭親德內閣的失敗。奧國國社黨閣員的撤職。匈牙利的反對法西斯獨裁。與羅馬尼亞的嚴禁鐵衛團活動。都是顯明的例子。這種種打擊。對於德國今後侵略的活動。是很有影響的。㊃意國在西班牙方面雖然失利。但在意南協定中則得到了一種收穫。現在它正採取着“東進”的外交。一面鞏固意粵匈的多瑙河集團。一面又拉攏羅馬尼亞。并促使奧國與捷克親好。企圖通過這個關係而與捷克連絡。漸漸把整個小協約吸收在它的羽翼之下。㊄蘇聯現在正取靜觀的態度。法國在小心翼翼應付着四周的環境。英國則趁着法國外交這個低潮時期。趁着德國最近所遭受的挫折。希望利用它傳統的兩重外交。操縱德法間的關係。增强它在歐洲政局中的力量。</p>
<p>這幾種轉變的局勢。就大體看。是好的成份多於壞的成份。也許在今後的一個期間。歐洲的局勢將獲得暫時的平靜。不過這種情形的可能性。却也要看兩個關鍵而定。第一是希特勒是否會因內政外交上的困難。向東面突然冒險一下。第二是英國對於歐洲和平的眞正態度。假使它眞正擁護集體和平的制度。則趁着最近傳說的國際經濟和平運動。英國應斷然有所作為。連絡美法等民主國家以至和平主義的蘇聯。迫使德國放棄其侵略的野心。假使它的擁擠和平是虛偽的。則它的政策適足以鼓勵德意冒險的野心。像去年三月德國的撕毀羅迦諾公約和後來德意的干涉西班牙內戰。就是顯明的例子。</p>
<p>據最近倫敦的著名“通報”Weck所載。在本年英皇加冕時期。希特勒將以驚人的行動。侵入捷克。這消息似乎是不大可信的。但據觀察者的意見。希氏每年必以某種對外的冒險。誇示給他的人民。以緩和德國內部的不安。則此種冒險。也不是絕對不可能的。然而。德國究竟是否敢這樣做。還是要看英國的態度。進攻捷克的行動。必然要牽涉到法蘇。這將是發動歐洲大戰的一顆眞正炸彈。德國在沒有看清英國的容忍限度以前。是不敢貿然有所動作的。</p>
<p>關於英國的態度。在下月英皇加冕。各國外交人物羣集倫敦之際。多少會看出一些端倪。這未來歐洲局勢的轉變。對於整個世界的和平。對於遠東國際的形勢。都是大有關係的。我們應當以最大的關心。注視這種情勢的發展。</p>
<h3>要求增工資不遂東京電車怠工</h3>
<p>軍費膨脹物價暴騰　勞工鬬爭達最高潮</p>
<p>［東京］東京市辦電車及公共汽車工人、今晨宣告怠工、故自今歲初所醞釀之日本勞工爭鬥之新潮、已達最高點、今日在街上行駛之電車及公共汽車、僅及尋常之半數、其速度亦極低、怠工者之主要要求、在增加工資百分之二十、而東京市當局僅允增加百分之六、旣往數年軍事費之膨漲、貨價均因之高漲、結果實際上之工資遂相當减低、工人感覺以平均每日日金一圓半之工資、在東京難以維持生活、陸軍省邇來因恐减低工人生活、或將嚴重影響國民健康及社會思想、乃决定將所僱數十萬工工資增加百分之八、以為緩和之計、東京市當局今拒絕工人之要求、足證其態度較陸軍省尤欠寬和、故電車工人甚為憤慨、而宣告怠工、據官方統計、自今年初所登記之全國勞工糾紛九百起、已及去年全年勞工糾紛之半數、今歲之勞工糾紛、其中百分之六十均為工人要求增加工資、故此次工潮之性質、主要為勞工階級之防禦鬥爭、以維持標凖之生活及反對因戰爭而起之通貨膨漲的進攻也、（中央社廿三日電）</p>
<h3>神戶大阪起而響應</h3>
<p>［神戶］神戶市電車職工聯合會、亦將曾經向當局提出、請增加實收工資一成之要求為根據、决計與東京電車相呼應、開始爭鬥、（廿三日同盟電）</p>

<h3>性質嚴重當局重視</h3>
<p>［東京］東京電車工潮、已於二十三日拂曉、全體實行怠工、揭開决戰之火、蓋因此各處備受奪足痛苦之市民、均陷於大混亂狀態中、市當局亦重視其前途、曾對於怠工團本部限於二十四日答覆、今則提早於二十三日午後、一時、並通知增薪六分二釐、該團本部當卽召集工人討論結果、對於市當局之解决案絕對反對、並將此意於午後三時通知當局、故工潮已入潛行運動、尚有更形惡化之趨勢、倘市當局對於工人方面不肯提出有力之方案、則此種不安狀態仍須繼續、自可豫料者也、警視廳方面目下正在奔走設法調停、值此總選舉急迫之際、形勢若何、殊屬可慮、或採取相當强壓手段亦未可知、（二十三日同盟社電）</p>

<p>今後外相　與駐日蘇聯大使之會談、尚須迭次進行、同時三相會談亦當繼續舉行、聞杉山陸相對於此事、較之米內海相尤有尖銳之質問、此後外相與蘇聯大使優列尼夫之會見尚有數次、極為各方面所重視、（廿三日同盟電）</p>

<h3>國聯將討論資源問題</h3>
<p>日决定三原則</p>

<p>⊙威尼斯港　意奧兩國當局進行談話所獲之主要結果非他、卽奧大利與捷克成立協定之議、業已决定予以放棄是也、意國對於德意兩國所搆成之政治軸心、旣信守不渝、爰乃為德國利益而辯護、并勸告奧國當局、苟欲與捷克國相接近、旣不可反對德國、亦不可不顧德國意旨而竟自為之、此外意奧兩國當局所發表之公報、尚有一點足以引起興趣、卽羅馬議定書業已完全變質、易言之、此項議定書原來目標、乃用以維護奧國獨立、並為匈牙利對於中歐洲局勢之見解作辯護、今則主張改造多瑙河流域各國現行局勢、而與德國暨小協商中某某國相合作、至公報所稱、“意奧兩國見解完全一致”一語、其意若曰奧國政府業已正式贊成德意兩國所搆成之政治軸心、關於奧國哈浦斯堡舊皇室復辟一項問題、公報並無隻字道及之、意奧兩國當局會晤時、似未討論此層也、（中央社二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>黨政機關監視復工</p>
<p>電車公司工人罷工案、前日經杜月笙會同黑政機關代表進行調處、商定四項辦法後、各工人認為滿意、故於昨晨五時半、至赫德路楊樹浦倍開爾路廠中、社會局特派朱圭林、市黨部派陸蔭初、會同工會代表、前往監視各工人於六時正、卽將各路車輛開出、恢復工作、</p>
<p>法商貼費尚未解决</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>佐藤注重擴大經濟活動</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>昨據東京電訊，關於日本統制在華經濟活動問題，中國各方，雖均願望以解决政治問題為先决條件，但此間財政資本及其他各界，似均未因之而感覺沮喪，反抱樂觀態度，深信僅須循日本旣往一二年在華經濟發展上獲得成功之途徑前進，毋庸對政治問題努力云云，誠然，滅人國家的方法很多，而國家所以自取滅亡之道亦不一，衆心分離，政治窳敗，對外因循，內戰頻起，漢奸傀儡之甘為人利用，以上種種，無一而非自取滅亡之道。</p>
<p>至於滅人家國的方法，非用武力强佔，便是用經濟侵略，或利用漢奸傀儡先為之分化，然利用漢奸傀儡分化，亦須以武力為後盾，西班牙之內亂，是其例也。經濟侵略，表面上似較和平，但是以亡人國家，其效能原不减於武力，莫謂他人不取急激手段，而用緩進漸進手段，為果有眞正親善的誠意也。</p>
<p>現在中日的外交當局，莫不曰以平等互惠為原則，此說似矣，但不知所謂平等互惠者，其權利的界說果若何？譬如甲有一物，乙欲攫為己有，甲固不與，乙則曰我與若“哈呼”，我與若平均分配，旣不使若吃虧，我亦决不便宜，此亦平等互惠之說也，現在某某鐵路，有與彼合辦之說，某某礦產，有與彼合作之議，所有我國有利事業，多欲與彼平分秋色，各居其半，而尚號於人曰，此平等互惠也，其誰信之。</p>
<p>假定與外人合資營業，其主權是否能操之於我，此中已有問題，萬一戰事發生，彼方得假保護礦產，保護路綫為名，自由進兵，自由駐軍，而我則無法以抗拒，故我方主張解决政治問題為先决條件，果然不差，茍其政治問題不解决，任何經濟問題多不願談，其用意固有所在，但是現在須要做到，須要認清的，華北的土地，均為我國的土地，華北的官吏，均為我國中央政府委任的官吏；故華北的一切政治活動，均須秉承中央政府以行，所有種種非法的組織，非法的協定，中央固决不承認，而我國民亦决不承認。</p>
<p>又其電訊中之言曰，中國各方，雖均願望解决政治問題為先决條件，日方並不悲觀，僅須循日本旣往一二年在華經濟發展上獲得成功之途徑前進，毋庸努方政治問題，試問這句話，有何等重要的意義？試問日本旣往一二年在華北發展的情狀？我們若不加以深切的考慮，與相當的準備，則有不堪設想者矣。</p>
<h3>剖</h3>
<p>— 雅憫</p>
<p>我已看慣了橫陳的屍體，防腐劑的臭味對我亦是熟悉的；再不會為酒精和“那富特林”的混合味刺激出眼涙，屍床前長時間的佇留也沒有暈弦的感覺。</p>
<p>兩年來解剖室的生活，到今日我已有鈍感的嗅覺與鈍感的感情。守着一具具裸露的屍體，就和守一具石膏的人體模型，我沒有一絲傷感或恐懼。因為成為醫學生的我是讓拉丁名詞和純物質觀裝滿了腦子的，我沒有那些屬於詩人和小孩子的感情。</p>
<p>死滅了的生物在醫學者同無生物有同樣的看法，因此，一具僵屍和解剖館的洗手盆，載屍的剖床在我全是一樣的。我們隔着屍體談笑，有時還割下一塊人肉送到同伴的面前：“老王，請吃一塊猪排。”說着這樣戲謔的話。也曾在晚間熄了解剖室的燈火，幾個人守着藏骨骼的大缸，伸手到滲凉的液體裏把一塊濕淋淋的骨骼摸出來，大家互相猜骨頭每一部分的名詞，憑這個來賭酒吃。</p>
<p>於是用最殘忍的方法敎育出來的最心硬的醫者，一個個走到社會上去，執行着世人所謂最仁慈的事業。</p>
<p>今晚，因為要逼趕一條大腿上肌肉的解剖，大學鐘樓敲十二下的時候，我還逗留在解剖室炫耀的燈光下，我蒼灰色僵硬的肌肉上滑走着銀色的解剖刀。</p>
<p>室子裏有我，有二十幾個完整的屍體，屍坑裏還有一些割殘了的肢體，有一個屍坑裏還用酒精醃藏着許多孩屍，另一個屍坑裏則是許多醜陋的頭顱，許多骨骼，許多臟腑。這情景想起來是頗為可怕的。</p>
<p>可是我安坐在死人堆裏，傾心於我的工作：廣大的解剖室裏也只有我一個人呼息的聲音。</p>
<p>我已熟嫻於解剖刀和　刀的用法，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>在這房間裏逗留到深夜在我也不是初次，不過今天我却有奇怪的心情，解剖刀在手下也異樣地遲鈍起來。時常魯莽地弄壞一根神經的紋絡，或是破壞了一束筋肉的組織。就是手下這肉脯似地枯屍，平日是很易剝離的，今晚却倔强地堅靱起來。</p>
<p>詫異於自己的心情，於是我再四地尋思着，最後注意到正在解剖的屍體。</p>
<p>這是一具女屍，據骨骼的發育和牙齒看上去，她生前該還是有着愛嬌的年紀的。</p>
<p>便在她憔悴的屍身上，我用幻想的彩筆描摩起她生前的風光來。</p>
<p>或者生前她是純潔的。珍惜着自己的美麗，也珍惜自己的戀情，不輕易容一個莽撞的少年挨近她的身邊，因此會有着聖處女的冷傲。也或者她是妖豔的姑娘，浮薄的少年浪費着過多的熱情或金錢，希冀在她身畔得到半時的溫馨。</p>
<p>可是在這裏，她毫無遮攔地在陌生的人前坦開她的軀體，讓輕薄的手指在她身上撫摩，沒有羞澀，也沒有拒絕，這是她生前所沒有夢想到的吧。</p>
<p>於是一個淡淡的輕愁爬上我的心，我垂了頭，想到死，想到自己如果躺在這裏的時候。</p>
<p>縱使不會像這些不幸的屍體一樣被人當作割剝的試騐品，可是墳墓裏，黃土塞住自己的口，讓黑蛇在心窩裏作巢，蚯蚓從骨肉裏穿過，那時候該更加難堪吧。</p>
<p>收拾起書冊和器具，我低着頭怱怱地離開這些屍體和房子。</p>
<h3>狗肉</h3>
<p>— 田舍</p>
<p>橋頭凉亭裏常常被油坊夥計們佔據着扯話，清早，各人把早飯碗和醬豆碟搬來聚餐，有的驕坐在凉亭木欄上，有的蹲在石碑脚邊，有的斜倚在扣牛的木椿上，油坊老闆看見一次總罵一次：“敎化胚料，有桌子給你們不伏，遍要像逃荒佬吃露天食。”可是夥計們這習慣是罵不改的，他們一等老闆轉背，便吱咕起來：“伏桌子，又沒有大魚大肉吃，每天醬豆，青菜湯…，伏桌子裝樣！”其實，在凉亭裏吃粥吃飯，與他們最大的方便還是：可以不受據束的扯話。</p>
<p>飯後息中，和傍晚息工在埠頭洗罷脚的時候，除掉起風落雨，一天三回，像大老闆們議什麼事般的，你一句，他一句，不過有時嘻嘻哈哈，喉嚨冲到半天，就沒像議事那樣鄭重，正經。他們三句話裏倒有兩句講“吃”，個個都好像害了“吃”病，也難怪，油坊裏只有米粥米飯挨一飽，菜水苦得很，初二，十六當葷，紅燒肉塊頭差點只跟骰子那麼大，一個人勉强派到兩塊，些微油水肚腸也滑不過來。因此土根歪嘴就常常發起吃大鍋肉，越肥越好，加淡菜木耳煨。長脚順富第一個贊成，“飯長精神肉長標，我們的標水都不好，誰不瘦得像猴子！”可是馬上來了反響，是油榨上的阿尤，他說話老帶些刻毒：</p>
<p>“吃肉，吃肉，猪還沒投胎呢。只聽見扶梯響，不見人下樓，光是嘴說，不化錢就有肉吃嗎，你們兩口荷包裏該多少？吃狗肉吧！”這些話引起大家一陣苦惱的笑，連土根歪嘴和長脚順富也笑了，歪嘴笑起來，覺得又滑稽，又可憐。笑聲把豆船上撑篙子的老黃也引上岸來了，因為他筋骨好，大家都呌他鐵骨頭，“鐵骨頭，你可要吃狗肉？嘿嘿嘿嘿嘿………”阿尤眼睛一瞇，嘴一癟一癟，身子靠着凉亭石柱。</p>
<p>“狗肉嗎，撈不到。”老黃拍着肩上的豆袋灰，布衫沒扣上鈕扣，午後的太陽照着他寬闊的胸脯，他一本正經地接着說：“狗肉不比猪肉壞，全是精的，比兔子肉香，像牛肉一般鮮潔，沒有馬肉那樣的酸味，而且狗肉吃了有好處，起傷，不論打傷，壓傷，掮傷，挑傷，比傷膏藥靈，賣狗皮膏藥的那來這許多狗皮！你們不相信，可以試騐，從前我在句容路裏撑班船，撞在橋椿上，足足發半年勞傷，是三大碗狗肉吃好的。”他又拍拍胸脯，呌大家看，現在他的身體能如此結實，完全該歸功於狗肉似的。</p>
<p>大家都聽得出了神，像大家都正在嘗着狗肉的滋味，香，鮮潔，沒有酸味。尤其是土根歪嘴，深被狗肉能起傷的說法吸引了，兇是常年患着勞傷的一個，白天做着活兒，有黃豆上便掮黃豆，油榨上缺人便給當下手，搬豆餅，槓石磨盤……倒還不覺得什麼，一到夜裏上牀便了不得，全身骨頭酸痛，手脚發燒，背脊出虛汗，逢下雨，就成天的發起病來，埠頭上雖不要上貨下貨，翻豆蒼却加倍吃力，老闆又不出門上街，油餅客人也沒個上門找他談生意，成天價監督夥計們工作，任憑腰疼得坍下也偷不得一些懶，吃飯沒法，要命的生活。</p>
<p>於是天天購吃，總算講出了眉目，吃狗肉不用化錢，容易辦，阿尤第一個呌人吃狗肉，逃不走，大家限他今夜到鄰近村子去捉狗，土根歪嘴担任柴火，剝和燒全由鐵骨頭動手，要喝酒的自己買，大家臉上都顯出一種喜悅，今夜上有肉吃了，滑滑枯燥的肚腸，狗肉不比猪肉壞，而且是大鍋的。鍋决定向油坊灶司務借，在橋脚邊掘土灶起火。阿尤雖也憧憬着狗肉的佳味，卻担心捉狗反被狗咬，或發生什麼意外。土根歪嘴心裏也正忐忑：“狗肉眞有能起傷的效騐嗎？天下眞有這樣靈的單方？”凉亭裏就好像充溢着生狗肉的腥味……。</p>

<h3>蓮花洞視察記</h3>
<p>— 陳效坎</p>
<p>貴州地處邊陲、崗巒叢疊，高峯入雲，素有山國之稱，而巖洞之多、尤為他處所不能及，其最負盛名者，為龍塲驛之陽明洞，但究厥實際，則該洞並不甚奇，不過以先哲王陽明先生對於黔省整個文化之開明，有非常之功蹟，因此地以人傳，而馳名遐邇矣，如以奇美言，則當推該省普定縣屬之蓮花洞，然因山陬僻壤，苗夷雜處，民智閉塞，故縱有清幽奇勝之古洞，外間知者無幾，僅或地方有兵燹時，作為避秦之桃源而已，烏虖，勝蹟湮滅，詎不長可惜耶。</p>
<p>比者，不佞有貴州之遊，因久耳普定蓮花洞之勝，特乘機往視察，俾得識廬山眞面目，旣抵普定，彳亍出北郭十數里，祇見峻嶺邱岡，綿互突兀，松柏䓤鬰，荊棘沒踝，大有行不得也哥哥之概，於是抖擻精神，轉山𡵿，越松嶺，穿豐林，渡曲澗，甫達目的地，一小徑在叢草中幾不能辨，經土人嚮導，始得洞，洞口險而狹，曲而斜，止可一人通過，魚貫入內，見天窗高敞，豁然開朗，經石鞏橋，循石級而下，約計七十七級，地極平廣，高可六十丈，四壁都為石鍾乳，其形似羅漢，似觀音，似猛獸，似飛禽，似尖塔，似龍柱，形形色色，目不暇給，右有石室，建築精緻，清幽絕俗，左有隧道，深不可測，時高時低，時寬時窄，曲折盡致，唯因黑暗之故，須燃燭方能行，行盡出口，又一大洞，較前洞大數倍，高兩百丈，地作斛坡形，高低相差，約為五十餘丈，高處有土隆起，花草叢生，清氣宜人，最低處有伏流經過，潺潺湲湲，猶若鐘皷之互擊也，洞之中央有一石泉下滴，滴落處有巨石，大可四人圍，四周且有緣可容水五吋許，掏而飲之，清冽醒脾，並有石鼓石鐘，擊之鏗然，石塔石龍，望之儼然、洞內並附小洞數十，或大或小，或高或低，或圓或方，或直或曲，或明或暗，或清或濁，或可以入探，或只能遠眺，而每洞壁上，多鐫佛像，塗以金，金光銀色以及古銅之班斕，熌目驚心，彌足稱道，而藝術之精美，尤堪珍奇，出洞時，復遇一石室，內藏中國歷代名人墨蹟，拓本及印度形書墨蹟，希臘托撤勞文形等，名貴文化遺物，以及其他古物頗夥，余曹胥有蠹魚嗜古癖，遂入內駐足瀏覽，費一小時之心力目力，綜其所獲，殊等於滄海之一粟也，視察歸來後，文以紀之，聊志鴻雪，並促該省當軸之注意，迅加勘察修葺，藉保勝跡云，。</p>

<h3>北平遊記</h3>
<p>— 亮</p>
<p>在我所到過的許多地方中，却沒有一個比得上北平這樣優美，處處充滿了東方幽靜的美妙氣象。</p>
<p>不像在大都會的社會裏，除了電影院舞塲等外，便沒有其他的娛樂地方，在北平只要化一些兒錢，坐着洋車，順着長安街上，便可到中山公園，飽賞着紅綠的花草，和吸着溫香清鮮的空氣。</p>
<p>中山公園的東邊，就是太廟，在那裏除有美麗的景緻外，還可看些明清兩代皇家祭司所用的東西。</p>
<p>從太廟又往東走幾十步，就到古物陳列所了，其中如商周之陶器，石碑，列代所用的武器，錢幣等等，莫不應有盡有。</p>
<p>熱鬧繁囂的東安市塲的對過路經西華門，就是三殿了，裏向建築非常宏麗，所有棟宇在在均雕刻繪畫，特綴着騰龍飛鳳，宛如生物。</p>
<p>隔着不遠，就是古宮，建築也格外壯麗，宮內還陳列着名貴的古董。</p>
<p>景山，或煤山就在古宮的附近，從這小小的山上，全城的景物，或北海，中南海的湖光，盡收眼底。</p>
<p>再往前十幾步，北海就在目前，北海的白塔，在水平如鏡的湖中相映，有時微風吹着，也有輕輕的白浪花激盪着，到了盛夏之時，湖內浮着红白的荷花，間點綴着几片小艇，確是说不出的美麗，直可嫓美杭湖。</p>
<p>城南的名勝，要算是天壇和先農壇了，這裏除了表顯着東方建築技術的高明外，還可賞着鬰鬰秀媚的林木，和四面幽靜，凡是到過北平的人，莫不有不涉足的。</p>
<p>至於城外的名勝更多了，一出西直門約幾里許，蜿蜒起伏的西山迎面而來，到了海甸，前面有許多聳峙着壯麗皇宮似的建築，巍然直立於被垂柳所圍着的湖畔的水塔，那就是燕京大學了，名聞全國的頤和園，或萬壽山，是在該校的西北邊，成遙遙相望之勢。</p>
<p>從靑龍橋，往西北邊，便可到寳藏寺，黑龍潭，溫泉，大覺寺等名勝，往西南的方向走着，便是玉泉山，臥佛寺，碧雲寺，香山，八大處等，古蹟勝地，那些地方，特別是香山，不特有雜花如錦，高入雲霄的山嶺等，優美的風景，同時氣候，高爽，為療病勝地，山顚山麓，遍建有要人的別墅，旅館養療院等，夏季遊客紛集，不愧為北平的廬山。</p>

<p>三月裏的陽光，溫暖得使那些已枯盡的桃柳，又長滿了嫩綠的葉子，垂柳的軟枝，低低地垂在水邊，長長的葉子，輕輕地拂在水面上，彷彿是一位長髪的少婦，對鏡整理她的晨妝，鮮紅潔白的碧桃，開滿了樹枝，像一個戴滿了鮮花的少女，可愛的小鳥，在枝頭唱着清脆悅耳的春之曲，好像告訴人們要及時行樂。</p>
<p>已經玩得膩煩的杭州，對於我們沒有多大興趣，所以就想到紹興去玩，清晨在旅館飽餐了一頓出發，因為錢江大橋沒有完成，所以到江干要過渡，平時是義渡，但汽車要一塊半錢一輛的渡費，達上了蕭紹段公路，路面出於意料的平坦，而又寬闊，跑遍了江浙皖的公路，祇有這裏是我們最滿意的。</p>
<p>當我們過了蕭山，風景更見得美麗，兩旁盡是楊柳，長得似翡翠的寳蓋，快成熟的麥生出肥肥的穗子，金黃色的菜花夾着粉紅色的草籽花及白色的豆花，構成一幅天然的圖案，一條不寬不狹的河道，那種紹興一帶特式的船，手足兼用而划的，在河面上來往着，帶有古式的石橋，益襯得風景是美麗了。</p>
<p>車開得非常快，不及一小時便到了紹興，再向左轉，沒有多少時光就是東湖，車子在橋邊停着不能過去，我們離了汽車，走過石橋，我正想這樣小小的地方，沒有奇峯，沒有怪石，一定會使我們失望，事實恰與理想相反，走進了大門，房屋相當的破舊，被風雨剝蝕了的牆壁，那些殘缺不全的窗戶，顯然是一個被遺棄了的舊蹟，也許現在慢慢地給人們注意起來，所以正在修楫，新做成的窗戶，白白地還沒有加油漆，牆壁及柱子，也有粉刷得很光潔，但有些仍是塗滿了無名作家的墨寳，雖然這樣的破舊，但是這裏的風景，不由得我呌一聲好，地方這樣幽靜，像一個世外桃源，帶有古色古香的風景，使您覺得在另一個世界裏，對面是天然生成像墻壁似的巖石，小小的湖面，平靜得似鏡子一般，曲折的盤槐，靜靜地垂在水面上，嬌艷的紫籐，好似將成熟時的葡萄，一串串的掛着，放出那醉人香氣，忽然躍出一條長長的大魚，靜靜的水面上頓時起了一個水花，慢慢的化大而回復到平靜，我們看了多時，雇了二條小船，慢慢地划到對面的巖石處，裏面恰好通過一條船的地位，兩旁高高的峭壁</p>

<p>，山上的泉水，一滴滴投向水中，船不能再前進，回頭划過小橋，向另一處巖石行走，發現了一個天然成功的洞，船是穿過這洞而在那面出來，我們又舍船登陸，肚子鬧着荒，但都不願離開這地方，結果託他們預備了一些點心，沽了幾斤老酒，舒舒服服的领略风景，把我们預定玩蘭亭的計劃都取消了，到非回去的時候，我們才動身回來，但我現在還忘不了這世外的桃源。</p>
<h3>雁蕩導游</h3>
<p>— 道鎔</p>
<p>“欲寫龍湫難着筆，不游雁蕩是虛生”，從這兩句詩裏，就可知道雁蕩的山水，究竟有多麼好了。</p>
<p>“散而為雁蕩，聚而為黃茸，削而為山峽，中國之四奇”，這是吳雅老遊過雁蕩而為全國名山的批評，從這四句批評中，我們說雁蕩是全國四大名山之一，不是過譽。</p>
<p>“春遊天台，秋遊雁蕩”，這是老於旅行的人們所習知的，因為雁蕩的奇峯怪石，不可勝數，春夏多霧，峯巒常被白雲封鎖，不若秋季的天朗氣清，可以看得明白；相傳雁蕩有馬蜞，叮人甚痛，秋天已無，所以秋遊雁蕩，是最相宜的，其實馬蜞早已絕跡，不成问題，春夏多雨，懸瀑飛流，雁蕩不是不宜於春天的。因為雁蕩的妙處，固在峯巒的雄奇怪誕，但是他的到處飛瀑，確是在全國名山中，找不出第二個。永嘉專員許蟠雲云“雁蕩一雨奔千瀑”，所以雁蕩不單以峯勝，還以瀑勝，說雁蕩是山水窟，這不是虛語，所以要看山水的，要看奇峯而兼有異瀑的，不得不遊雁蕩，中委經亨頤前年來遊雁蕩有句云，“雁蕩春已勝天台”，足徴雁蕩不特宜於秋遊，尤宜於春遊，現在正是遊春的大好季節，所以我來談談雁蕩的導游。</p>
<p>雁蕩是以鳥名山，在浙東溫州的樂清縣，唐時阿羅漢諾詎那是開山祖，宋室南遷，遊踪始盛，當時山中有十八名剎，其盛况概可想見，周圍約三百六十里，有百二峯，內分東內谷，東外谷，西內谷，西外谷，南閣，北閣，六大區，東內谷內，風景最多，幾乎到處都是，如入山陰道上，目不暇接，郁達夫說轎夫一路指示，腦中不易記憶，幾乎要想對轎夫討饒，呌他不要說了，確是實情。</p>
<p>雁蕩山水之佳，不待多方宣傳，固已盡人皆知，但是一般遊客，雖有雅興，因為途徑不熟，山中情况不明，所以大都欲行又止，聽說有許多人到了杭州很想到雁蕩一遊，終因情形隔膜，半途折回，這是多麼可惜的一回事，我對於雁蕩情形，比較熟悉，所以極願把我所知道的，告訴大衆，如於遊客有一得之助，這是我所欣慰的。</p>
<p>要遊雁蕩，可從水陸兩方面走，水路方面，可在上海十六舖乘每星期四下午出口的益利輪船到溫州，星期六晨卽可在溫渡江到山，非常方便，益利輪極清潔；比較坐汽車舒服，或乘招商的海晏輪到溫，時間因直放的關係，可縮短三分之一，否則乘輪到臨海縣的海門登陸，改乘汽車到山，亦極便利，總之，如不用自己的汽車或包客車，與其趁公共汽車不如乘輪船來得舒適。陸路方面又有二路，一由杭州乘汽車經處州溫州而達雁蕩，或由杭乘火車至義烏，改乘汽車赴處州溫州，再達雁蕩，這是西路。另一路則由杭趨台州而達雁蕩，這是東路，遊客如有自備汽車或租小包車，則由杭動身，一日可達，但中經杭州臨海黃岩水漲四渡，臨海渡要注意他的潮水，否則潮落待漲，說不定要等三五個鐘頭，這是遊客們應特別注意的，其餘各渡，則無關係。倘由西路來的，也要注意到溫州同清江兩渡的潮水，自備汽車過渡，每次要納一二元的渡費，如遇下午六時後，還要加倍納費。遊客倘兼遊天台，則先到天台住宿一二日，尤為妥當，途中不致發生困難問題，至於公路方面，路面近來修得甚好，行車不感不便，惟沿途車站設備簡陋，對於女客，比較略有不便，但近日公路局方面，正在設法改良，不久當可滿足旅客的希望。</p>
<p>遊客於不明途徑之外，對於途中的安全，也多顧慮，其實東路方面，毫無問題，儘可放心，山中的情形，更非外間所能明瞭，其中不但無盜賊，並且無烟賭，無流氓，無乞丐，所以陣肇英說，浙江祇有雁蕩是一塊乾凈土，眞彷彿如世外桃源，管理委員會的沿途種桃，意思彷彿也是造成一個桃源的。</p>
<p>我把到山的途徑和山中的情形簡單介紹之後，還得把山中食宿的情形再約略說一說，現在的總入口處是響嶺頭，遊客到達終點後，可揀旅館或寺院投宿，旅館現有二家，在車站相近的有雁山旅社，房間比較高敞，惟房金略高，分每人兩元或一元兩種，伙食每客分二角三角，至於雁蕩旅館，開設靈岩寺口，房金最高每人八角，宜於經濟遊山者，惟衛生設備較差。如住寺院，則以靈岩寺為第一，因雁蕩的風景，集中靈岩，有峯有瀑，可謂集山水的大成。其次為靈峯寺，因係新建，又次為凈名寺，房屋欠佳，又次為觀音洞，以香客居住為多，再次為北斗洞白雲菴等，其中如靈岩凈名，現有新式衛生設備，惜因遊客的不道德，已把他搗壞，現在抽水馬桶，正在重裝，不久靈峯寺的洋磁浴盆及抽水馬桶，也可裝好了。此外如大龍湫的龍壑軒，西石梁雁影山房，散水岩凌霄觀，也都可吃飯投宿，但每夜至多宿得十多人，所以結伴旅行的，到山以後，務須妥為計劃，以免臨時不易解决。</p>
<p>說完食宿情形以後，當然要把山中交通器具來講一講，山中除轎之外，還有黃包車，約三十餘輛，汽車到時，遊客可挨次乘坐，因此間規矩，須依順序，不准你搶我奪，彷彿同杭州西興碼頭的車夫一樣，頗有秩序。轎子都是藤的，式樣已履次改良，先為黃包車式，今則又大有進步，頗合實用，陳誠和張大千等先後來遊雁蕩，認為全國名山，無此好轎，寗波專員徐士達則稱該轎為如意轎萬能轎，其餘一般旅客，也各有好評。</p>
<p>其次要說到山中的遊程了，遊覽的方式，可分為放射式和週遊式兩種，放射式是由住處出去當日返寓，其利在食宿比較舒適，但缺點則遊覽時間較為侷促。週遊式則隨地投宿，不返原寓，其利在有充分的時間可以遊覽，缺點則在食宿較苦，二程各有優點缺點，這要看各人的性情而異其趨向了。如要定一個遊覽日程，則蔣叔南的一覽表狠可供參考，但是現在的情形不同了，我的意思，遊覽一日的，可遊靈岩靈峯大龍湫三處，二日的第一日赴散水岩龍溜顯勝門南閣眞際寺靈峯朝陽洞等處，第二日先赴西石梁再看梅雨瀑羅帶瀑大龍湫燕尾瀑靈岩寺凈名寺三折瀑等處，如能遊三日，則第一日改赴北閣看寒嶺下的大瀑和旬嶺下一路的仙橋仙人洞美人吉士峯等，第二日赴南閣一路第三日赴西外谷一路總之靈岩寺是最好的地方，應放做最後看，庶如看壓軸戲，較有滋味，否則愈看愈遠，愈散；遊山的興趣，無形要减去了不少。倘有要登高處的，可到雁湖，或百崗尖，亦好，不過時間方面，不易許可。</p>
<p>遊山的人，每遇着雨，就要掃興，但是雁蕩則不然，晴天固好，就是下雨亦好，因有雨則瀑大，不看峯而看瀑，也頗有趣，蕭錚來遊雁蕩說，“名山帶雨看”，頗有道理，我常說雁蕩不特宜於秋遊，實宜於四時遊，就是雪遊風遊霧遊曉遊月夜遊乃至黑夜遊，也都有各式各樣的妙處，最好是秋冬之交，大雨之後，明月之夜，其味尤為無窮。</p>
<p>有人說，雁蕩山峯之怪而且多，恐怕不及桂林，其實不然，桂林雖多奇峯怪石，却無飛瀑懸崖，故以桂林相比，雁蕩或勝一籌，生長在桂林的馬君武有詩云，“如何雁蕩石，酷似桂林峯”照他的意見，起碼雁蕩與桂林，可以並駕齊驅了.。</p>
<p>遊客倘有遊雁蕩的興趣，如有不甚明瞭的地方，可以隨時向該山管理委員會詢問，他們很歡迎遊客，當可有滿意的答覆。</p>

<p>四月十三申報有雁蕩旅行之舉，茲將沿途情形，略述於後。由上海往雁蕩不下數百里，遊者恒以路遙為苦，以供有興者參考，並得一賞名山之快。本團是日下午三時由上海出發，走滬杭公路約七時餘抵杭垣，車直達新新旅館，該館因地居裏西湖，僻靜幽美，而取價不昂，卽在旅館中夜飯下榻也。次早七時卽起程至南星橋渡錢塘江每輛汽車取渡費一元半，由蕭紹路經蕭山紹興在紹興站折北，經東湖，亦山陰之名勝也。略遊片刻復行至曹娥站，南彎入嵊新路，至嵊縣，復東向，至新昌，蓋東首之路，乃往奉化者，其南則新天路，（新昌至天台）在新昌車站向鄉人索開水各取備有之乾糧充饑。經天台加汽油，至臨海，中有一段穿嶺而過者，嶺約四五百尺之高，在臨海渡靈江，流甚急，渡船又依人力每次祇能渡一輛汽車，一來一回需時半小時之久，今共有五輛車，費時二小時有半，他日渡江用汽船則時間可節省多多。再行至黃岩，又需過渡者蓋地橋乃浮橋耳祇能行人不能行車，此次渡江較有經騐矣。每當渡過兩輛後，卽分別先行，如是則時間少節省。經澤國縣時，天色已黑，至水漲渡，再渡江，此流水淺，不需用舵，而用撑，故船上不占地位，每次可載兩輛汽車，而二岸距離較短，約十分鐘可解决，由此地去雁蕩山祇二英里之路程，到目的地已晚九時左右矣，此路由上海至雁蕩共長三百七十二英里。</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry Have Submitted a Report to the Executive Yuan Regarding the Case of Tax-Exempt Transportation of Foreign Rice to Guangdong</h3>
<p>In Principle, the Number of 4 Million Dan Remains; The Guangdong Food Regulation Committee Decides to Handle the Matter in Accordance with the Ministry's Instructions; Provincial and Municipal Banks Prepare to Jointly Offer Grain and Rice Loans</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The case of Guangdong Province importing foreign rice with tax exemption has been reviewed by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for discussion. The two ministries have jointly decided that, in principle, the number of 4 million dan of tax-exempt imports will remain. However, it is necessary to consider the domestic production and storage situation, as well as the needs of Guangdong Province, to handle registration at any time and import tax-exempt imports in moderation, not simultaneously. When there is a surplus of domestic rice, imports may be temporarily suspended to be in line with the requirements of rice merchants. This has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Gao Bingfang, Director of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, told reporters that regarding the case of tax exemption for the import of foreign grain and rice into Guangdong, the quantity is still 4 million shi, and the opinions of experts have been adopted, which can be imported for four months. The six management measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance have made appropriate control over the import of foreign grain and rice and have also taken into account the price and sales of domestic rice. The Guangdong authorities have followed suit, and it is expected that this problem can be resolved. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] The Guangdong Food Regulation Committee sent Secretary Director Li Dachao and Section Chief Shen Guojin of the Grain Transport Bureau to consult with Li Du, Commissioner of the Guangdong Customs, on the 23rd to handle the procedures for the tax-exempt import of foreign grain and rice.

All registration and visa matters will be handled by the customs, with the Food Regulation Committee sending personnel to assist. The provincial government also announced the matter to all rice merchants. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Tax-exempt transportation of foreign rice to Guangdong is scheduled to begin on the 24th. Registration and issuance of certificates will be done at the Food Regulation Committee, and imports can begin on the same day. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] The rice shortage in Guangdong has lasted for months, and the people are in dire straits. The Central Government, in consideration of the people's difficulties, has specially approved the tax-exempt import of 4 million dan of foreign grain and rice for relief. After the registration and visa procedures are completed, implementation will begin. The Municipal Bank believes that this is still not a fundamental solution and has decided to jointly offer grain and rice loans with the Provincial Bank to revitalize rural finance and increase production. The 23rd was specially used to discuss the matter with the Provincial Bank. Implementation will begin after the entire plan is formulated. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>Discussing Supplemental Budget Increases and Decreases; The National Assembly Two Laws Will Be Reviewed Next Week</p>

The amended article is as follows: "When the creditors' meeting makes a resolution on reconciliation, it shall have the consent of more than half of the creditors present, and the amount of debt they represent shall also account for more than two-thirds of the total unsecured debt." (According to the original provisions on the total amount of debt, it was three-quarters.

<p>[Nanjing] The Central Standing Committee passed the amendment to the National Assembly Organization Law and the Representative Election Law, and deleted Article 146 of the Draft Constitution. It has been sent to the Legislative Yuan on the 23rd. President Sun separately approved the original drafting committees of the hospital, Fu Bingchang, Liang Hancao, Lin Bin, and Huang Youchang, to review it. A review meeting is expected to be held next week. According to a certain committee member of the hospital, the Central Government has stipulated the main points for this amendment to the National Assembly Organization Law and the Representative Election Law. The hospital only needs to make technical modifications to the relevant articles of the two laws based on the amended main points. As for the constitutional draft, since only Article 146 has been deleted, the amendment procedure is easier. Only the order of the two articles after the original Article 146 needs to be changed. The future constitutional draft will be reduced from the original 148 articles to 147 articles. Other reasons for amending the case will be announced by the Central Standing Committee.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Committee Members Debate the Increase and Decrease Budget</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] When the Legislative Yuan reviewed the first case on the 23rd, Chen Changheng of the Finance Committee first reported on the content of the case and the review process. Then, Luo Ding raised questions to the Finance Committee. Luo said that it is permissible to add a budget after the end of the year to supplement revenue and expenditure in accordance with precedents and the newly revised regulations of the Budget Law on adding a budget. However, reducing the budget falls within the scope of the final accounts. After the end of the year, instead of expediting the final accounts, a reduced budget is handled, abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial. Does this hinder the spirit of the budget system? He asked the Finance Committee to explain. Chen Changheng replied that there are two items in the reduction in this case: one is the reduction of more than 390,000 yuan in tobacco and alcohol tax in revenue, and the other is the reduction of more than 3.74 million yuan in debt expenses in expenditure. The two offset each other, resulting in a decrease in expenditure, which is a good phenomenon in finance. However, the current budget system has not yet been brought into order, and the preparation of final accounts is very late. In order to show the truth of the country's finances, the parts that should be reduced in the budget are reduced to avoid a large difference between the final accounts and the budget in the future. Afterwards, the two committees, Luo and Chen, continued to debate, but the result was still to add and reduce the budget according to the case. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Significance of Amending the Two National Assembly Laws</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The date of the National Assembly was previously resolved by the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee to be postponed to November 12 of this year. Since the National Assembly Organization Law and the Representative Election Law were not perfect, the Central Standing Committee was specially authorized to amend them. The 42nd meeting of the Central Standing Committee on the 22nd amended the above two regulations. After the legislative procedures are completed, the re-election of the National Assembly representatives will be actively promoted. The Central News Agency reporter visited a certain person on the 23rd to inquire about the significance of this amendment to the two regulations and the progress of the National Election work. According to reports, the most important points of the National Assembly Organization Law and the Representative Election Law amended by the Central Standing Committee are ㊀ amending the functions and powers of the National Assembly. According to the original National Assembly Organization Law, in addition to formulating the constitution, the National Assembly also had the power to exercise the powers conferred by the constitution. The amendment has deleted "exercising the powers conferred by the constitution" and clearly stipulates that "the term of this National Assembly shall end when the meeting is completed and the task is completed." The meaning is to enable this National Assembly to concentrate its efforts on drafting the constitution in order to produce a perfect constitution. ㊁ Deleting the item that the Chairman of the National Government may attend the National Assembly. Article 5 of the Organization Law stipulates that "the National Assembly shall be convened by the National Government on a regular basis." Since the National Government has the power to convene the National Assembly, the Chairman of the National Government can of course participate, and a special seat for the Chairman is set up in the National Assembly. The Central Standing Committee deleted this article to show respect for the Chairman. ㊂ Adding 240 representatives appointed by the National Government to the number of National Assembly representatives. This is to remedy the poverty of elections and to recruit talents from all parties and collect ideas for the drafting of the constitution. ㊃ Canceling all provisions in Article 6 and below of the Election Law regarding the designation of candidates by the National Government. This amendment can eliminate disputes in the designation and promote the spirit of universal suffrage. Therefore, the Central Standing Committee's amendment to the above two regulations has great significance and greatly facilitates the promotion of National Election work. Regarding National Election work, it can be actively promoted after the two regulations have undergone legislative procedures. It is expected that the re-election can be completed in March or April. The initial candidates will of course be valid in the re-election. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Transformation of the European Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The recent European diplomatic situation is gradually transforming. This transformation can be summarized in the following points. ㊀ The small and medium-sized countries of Northern Europe, seeing the turmoil and dangers in Central Europe, are engaging in a kind of local unity to protect themselves. This is evidenced by the so-called Baltic Group brewing at the beginning of this year and the recent signing of the Oslo Agreement. ㊁ In the Spanish War, the armed intervention by Germany and Italy has now largely failed. Judging from the recent situation, although Germany and Italy cannot completely give up and quietly watch the collapse of the rebel army, their attitude of armed intervention will inevitably not be as blatant as before due to the implementation of coastal surveillance measures. ㊂ Germany has not only failed in Spain, but has also suffered many setbacks in Central and Eastern Europe. The failure of the pro-German cabinet in Finland, the removal of National Socialist Party members in Austria, Hungary's opposition to Fascist dictatorship, and Romania's strict prohibition of Iron Guard activities are all clear examples. These blows have a great impact on Germany's future aggressive activities. ㊃ Although Italy suffered losses in Spain, it gained something in the Italian-Yugoslav Pact. Now it is adopting a "eastward advance" diplomacy, consolidating the Italy-Austria-Hungary Danube Group on one hand, and wooing Romania on the other, while also prompting Austria and Czechoslovakia to be friendly, attempting to connect with Czechoslovakia through this relationship and gradually absorb the entire Little Entente under its wings. ㊄ The Soviet Union is now taking a wait-and-see attitude. France is cautiously dealing with the surrounding environment. Britain is taking advantage of this low tide in French diplomacy and the recent setbacks suffered by Germany, hoping to use its traditional dual diplomacy to manipulate the relationship between Germany and France and enhance its power in the European political situation.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, these transforming situations have more good elements than bad elements. Perhaps in the coming period, the European situation will achieve temporary calm. However, the possibility of this situation depends on two key factors. First, whether Hitler will suddenly take a risk to the east due to internal and external difficulties. Second, Britain's true attitude towards European peace. If it truly supports the system of collective peace, then taking advantage of the recent rumored international economic peace movement, Britain should decisively take action, connecting democratic countries such as the United States and France and even the pacifist Soviet Union to force Germany to abandon its aggressive ambitions. If its support for peace is hypocritical, then its policy will only encourage the adventurous ambitions of Germany and Italy. The German tearing up of the Locarno Treaty in March last year and the later German-Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War are clear examples.</p>
<p>According to the recent well-known "Dispatch" Weck in London, Hitler will invade Czechoslovakia with surprising actions during the coronation of the British monarch this year. This news seems to be unreliable, but according to observers, Mr. Hitler must show off to his people with some kind of external adventure every year to alleviate internal German unrest. Therefore, this kind of adventure is not absolutely impossible. However, whether Germany dares to do this ultimately depends on Britain's attitude. The action of attacking Czechoslovakia will inevitably involve France and the Soviet Union, which will be a real bomb that triggers a European war. Germany will not dare to act rashly without seeing the limits of Britain's tolerance.</p>
<p>Regarding Britain's attitude, some clues will be seen when diplomatic figures from various countries gather in London for the coronation of the British monarch next month. This transformation of the future European situation has a great relationship with the peace of the entire world and the international situation in the Far East. We should pay the greatest attention to the development of this situation.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Tram Workers Go on Strike After Wage Increase Request Fails</h3>
<p>Military Spending Balloons and Prices Soar; Labor Disputes Reach a Climax</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Tokyo municipal tram and bus workers announced a strike this morning, so the new wave of Japanese labor disputes that has been brewing since the beginning of this year has reached its climax. Today, only half the usual number of trams and buses are running on the streets, and their speed is also extremely low. The main demand of the strikers is a 20% wage increase, while the Tokyo municipal authorities only agreed to a 6% increase. The expansion of military spending in recent years has caused prices to rise, resulting in a substantial reduction in actual wages. Workers feel that it is difficult to maintain a living in Tokyo with an average daily wage of 1.5 yen. The Army Ministry recently decided to increase the wages of the tens of thousands of workers it employs by 8% to alleviate the situation, fearing that reducing workers' living standards would seriously affect national health and social thought. The Tokyo municipal authorities' refusal to meet the workers' demands proves that their attitude is even less accommodating than that of the Army Ministry. Therefore, tram workers are very angry and have announced a strike. According to official statistics, there have been 900 registered labor disputes nationwide since the beginning of this year, which is half the total number of labor disputes last year. This year, 60% of labor disputes are workers demanding wage increases. Therefore, the nature of this labor unrest is mainly a defensive struggle by the working class to maintain a standard of living and oppose the inflation caused by the war. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Kobe and Osaka Rise in Response</h3>
<p>[Kobe] The Kobe Municipal Tram Workers' Union has also decided to echo the Tokyo tram strike, based on its previous request to the authorities for a 10% increase in actual wages, and to start a struggle. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>⊙Osaka The Osaka Municipal Electric Transportation Labor Union and other four groups, also inspired by the Tokyo tram workers' strike, intend to unite the great power of the workers to achieve the wage increase issue in one fell swoop. They have also scheduled a mass labor mobilization to gather at the Osaka City Hall on the morning of the 28th to urge the authorities to respond. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Army Factory Workers Get Pay Raise</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Since taking office, Army Minister Sugiyama has paid great attention to the issue of improving national physique, especially increasing labor and expanding productivity. Recently, due to rising prices, workers' lives have become increasingly uneasy. He has decided to increase the wages of 100,000 workers in army factories. The increase is 8% of the wages paid on April 1st. The army authorities estimate that the increase in workers' wages will cost approximately 300,000 yuan annually. The army is the first to implement this among the workers in various government-run factories in Japan. The army's increase in wages for workers is a practical step in the Lin Cabinet's social policy and stabilizing the people's lives. However, according to the army's own view, government-owned industry workers are also directly related to national defense. Therefore, it does not hesitate to make great sacrifices to implement wage increases to stabilize workers' lives. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Serious Nature, Authorities Pay Attention</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Tokyo tram strike was fully implemented at dawn on the 23rd, igniting the flames of a decisive battle. The citizens, who are suffering from foot pain everywhere, are in a state of great chaos. The municipal authorities also pay attention to its future, and have limited the strike group headquarters to respond by the 24th. Now, it has been advanced to 1:00 PM on the 23rd, and the increase of six percent and two li is also notified. The group headquarters immediately convened a meeting of workers to discuss the results. The city authorities' solution was absolutely opposed, and this intention was notified to the authorities at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Therefore, the labor unrest has entered into a subtle movement, and there is still a tendency to worsen. If the municipal authorities are unwilling to propose a strong plan to the workers, this state of unease will continue, which can be predicted. The Metropolitan Police Department is currently running around trying to mediate. At this time of urgent general election, the situation is particularly worrying, and it is not known whether considerable coercive measures will be taken. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

I have met with him twice and exchanged opinions as much as possible on adjusting relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and resolving outstanding issues. At this time of great importance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that it is necessary to fully listen to the intentions of the relevant army and naval forces. Therefore, it has fully consulted with the army and navy ministers in advance, and then met with the Soviet ambassador. The ambassador will soon be transferred, so I would like to take this opportunity to put the relations between the two countries on a proper track.</p>
<p>In the future, the Foreign Minister and the Soviet Ambassador to Japan will have to hold successive meetings, and at the same time, the Three Ministers' talks will continue to be held. It is heard that Army Minister Sugiyama has sharper questions than Naval Minister Yonai on this matter. The meeting between the Foreign Minister and Soviet Ambassador Yurenev is extremely important to all parties. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Rumor that Russian Ambassador to Japan Will Be Transferred to Berlin</h3>

When Suritz left Germany, many believed that the envoy to Czechoslovakia, Alexandrovsky, would be transferred to Berlin. This plan has apparently been abandoned.

<h3>League of Nations to Discuss Resource Issues</h3>
<p>Japan Decides on Three Principles</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato summoned Yasuto Shuto, the Japanese representative who attended the Resources Special Committee in Geneva in March, to discuss various countermeasures because the League of Nations will reconvene the Resources Special Committee in Geneva in June. As a result, the basic policy was determined: to restore freedom on the three issues of obtaining resources, developing resources, and commerce and trade, in order to achieve equal distribution of resources among countries and establish a foundation for peace. Therefore, the Foreign Minister decided to order Representative Shuto to attend the committee and clarify Japan's position based on these three principles. In addition to the natural conditions of resource disparity, the resulting restrictions on commerce and other man-made conditions, the relationship between rich and poor countries breeds the causes of instability in the world atmosphere. Recently, after countries recognized this fact, those in the know strongly advocated the necessity of equal distribution of resources. Therefore, the League of Nations General Assembly decided last summer to establish a Special Committee on Resources to study and solve the specific methods of resource issues. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send Shuto to attend the meeting to advocate the three principles. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>US Export-Import Bank Director's Mission in China</h3>
<p>[Washington] US Export-Import Bank Director Pierson is currently in China. It was announced here today that his mission is to investigate whether it is feasible for the bank to provide loans to US merchants who are preparing to sell machinery and other items to the Chinese market.

However, it is learned that although the bank is an official agency to promote import and export trade, it is legally unauthorized to directly loan to China, and can only assist US exporters in developing the Chinese market. Pierson is scheduled to stay in China for four to six weeks. (Kuomin News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>A Woman Turns into a Man</h3>
<p>⊙Brussels Ms. Tebom, who is twenty-three years old and from here, wins trophies in every bicycle race and has done so for five consecutive years. Two years ago, after undergoing surgery, she has become a great man and has taken the male name "Weilai." Although Ms. Tebom lacked female characteristics, everyone knew she was a woman until after undergoing surgery, when she wore men's clothing. Only when participating in competitions did she change her hairstyle. Recently, the local public security bureau, because her identity and photos, although belonging to two men and women, were very similar, began to investigate, and the secret of the lady was revealed. The authorities then only allowed her to choose to be a man or a woman, and the lady has admitted to being a man. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>End of Talks Between Italy and Austria, Rome Protocols Altered</h3>
<p>Reshaping the Current Situation in the Danube Region, Austria Abandons Agreement with Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>⊙Venice Port: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini held his second meeting with Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg at 11:00 AM this morning, which concluded at noon. They then had lunch together, with other representatives from both countries present. Mussolini returned to Rome in the afternoon, while the Austrian Chancellor is scheduled to return to Vienna at 6:00 PM this afternoon. In addition, the German ship "Mil-Ke" is currently anchored in this port. Prime Minister Mussolini visited the ship this morning and was greeted by the ship's owner, with both sides exchanging speeches. Prime Minister Mussolini spoke in German, and the ship's owner said, "We are visiting your country for the first time, and we are honored to receive greetings from your Prime Minister today." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>⊙Venice Port: The main result of the talks between the Italian and Austrian authorities is the decision to abandon the proposal for an agreement between Austria and Czechoslovakia. Italy, adhering firmly to the political axis formed by Germany and Italy, defended Germany's interests and advised the Austrian authorities that if they wished to approach Czechoslovakia, they should not oppose Germany or disregard Germany's wishes. Furthermore, one point in the joint communiqué issued by the Italian and Austrian authorities is of particular interest: the Rome Protocols have been completely altered. In other words, the original goal of these protocols was to safeguard Austria's independence and to defend Hungary's views on the Central European situation. Now, they advocate reshaping the current situation in the Danube region countries in cooperation with Germany and certain countries in the Little Entente. The communiqué's statement that "Italy and Austria have completely identical views" implies that the Austrian government has formally endorsed the political axis formed by Germany and Italy. The communiqué does not mention the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria, and it seems that this issue was not discussed during the meeting between the Italian and Austrian authorities. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>⊙Venice: Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg held a three-hour meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this afternoon, from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano and Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt were also present. The two authorities scheduled another meeting for 11:00 AM tomorrow morning. According to a key figure who participated in today's talks, the main topics of discussion were two: first, the relationship between Czechoslovakia and Austria and its connection to the Rome Protocols; and second, the agreements established between Germany and Austria and between Germany and Italy. According to informed sources, the Austrian Chancellor explained the Rome Protocols, believing that they allow each signatory country the freedom to develop diplomatic relations with non-signatory countries. Therefore, the mutual approach between Czechoslovakia and Austria is permitted by the protocols. However, the Italian side believes that the German-Austrian agreement and the German-Italian agreement are complementary to the Rome Protocols. Therefore, the signatories of the Rome Protocols should not adopt an attitude opposing Germany. The agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia does not conflict with the Rome Protocols because it does not oppose Germany. As for Czechoslovakia and Austria, if they wish to approach each other, it must be conditional on not opposing Germany. Political figures believe that Italy's adoption of this attitude is not only to protect Germany's interests but also to protect Hungary's interests. Since Italy has signed political and economic agreements with Yugoslavia and recently proposed mutual cooperation with Romania, Hungary can no longer make territorial claims regarding the Transylvanian province occupied by Yugoslavia and Romania (which belonged to Hungary before the European War). Therefore, Italy can only encourage Hungary to focus on Czechoslovakia. If Czechoslovakia and Austria approach each other, Hungary's territorial demands will inevitably be blocked everywhere and have no outlet. In addition, it is heard that the negotiations between Italy and Austria also involved military issues. As for the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria, it will be resolved in a vague manner as a "non-realistic issue." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Communiqué Issued</h3>
<p>⊙Venice: The Italian and Austrian Prime Ministers continued their talks this morning and issued a communiqué afterward, stating, "The common goal of Prime Minister Mussolini and Chancellor Schuschnigg for Italian-Austrian cooperation to reshape the current situation in the Danube region cannot be achieved without Germany's participation. The views on the mutual relations between Italy and Austria and other countries, as well as various issues related to Italy and Austria, especially economic issues, are completely consistent after discussions between the two sides. Furthermore, the Rome Protocols signed by Italy, Austria, and Hungary in March of last year, which stipulate that other countries in the Danube region may also sign and join under certain conditions, have produced good results and are deeply gratified. In short, the Rome Protocols, the agreement between Italy and Austria established in July of last year, and the political and economic agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia established in March of this year are of great benefit to the development of the Central European situation and European general peace."

<h3>Polish Foreign Minister Visits Roman Authorities</h3>
<p>Seeking to Expand Former Alliance</p>
<p>⊙Romanian Capital: After arriving here, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck met with King Carol for a long time and then met with the Romanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Well-informed sources recently stated that Poland and Romania signed an alliance treaty in 1921, which included a mutual assistance agreement, and that further expansion is planned, with the army staff departments of the two countries cooperating further. In addition, the Romanian authorities also advocate attracting Czechoslovakia and Poland, and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck has also suggested that Romania should improve its mutual relations with Hungary. The economic relations and tourism matters between Poland and Romania have been handed over to experts for research. In short, the attitude of both parties in this talk was very friendly and mutually trusting. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British and French Military Authorities Hold Talks in London</h3>
<p>Release Belgium from Locarno Obligations, Anglo-French Declaration Postponed</p>
<p>[London] After arriving here yesterday afternoon, French State Councillor and Minister of National Defense Daladier held talks that evening at the French Embassy with British Minister for Coordination of Defence Sir Thomas Inskip, Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha, Chief of the Imperial General Staff General Sir Cyril Deverell, and many other senior British generals. Well-informed sources state that, regarding the cooperation and assistance to Belgium by Britain and France after Belgium's cancellation of the guarantor obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty, a complete compromise has been reached between Britain and France as a result of this discussion. It is reported that British military experts have proposed to France that if Belgium is invaded in the future, the aid provided by Britain and France to that country should be limited to the air force, so as to avoid any hasty action on the army side due to a lack of prior preparation, which would lead to various dangers. As for the cooperation between Britain and France, the agreement between the staff departments of the two countries remains effective and should continue to maintain close contact. Britain is very pleased that France is currently extending the "Maginot Line" (named after the late French Minister of War) to the northern border, which makes France safe on the northern frontier. At noon today, Daladier had lunch with Foreign Secretary Eden at the Savoy Hotel. According to well-informed sources, the two discussed the matter of Eden visiting Belgium to consult after the publication of the joint Anglo-French declaration. In addition, the two also explained that Britain and France have completely identical views on various international issues, such as the non-intervention issue in the Spanish Civil War, the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, and the establishment of an international agreement to publicize the military status of each country. Daladier has accompanied the French Ambassador to Britain Corbin to Manchester in the evening to attend and deliver a speech at the local branch of the Anglo-French Friendship Association. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the publication of a joint declaration by Britain and France to release Belgium from the guarantor obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty, diplomatic sources recently stated that the declaration will be postponed for several days. The Belgian government has requested slight modifications to the original wording, so a new draft was prepared after discussions between French State Councillor and Minister of National Defence Daladier, who is currently here, and the British authorities, and was submitted to the Belgian government for review. As of now, Belgium has not yet indicated acceptance. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>France Is Willing to Defend Freedom</h3>
<p>Daladier Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>⊙Manchester: French Minister of National Defence Daladier stated in a speech to the annual meeting of the Anglo-French Association here today that wealth and welfare in the modern world can only be obtained through free trade. The opposition between freedom and autocracy in the past is now seen in the economic and financial spheres, and the escalation of its methods will inevitably lead to an explosion one day. He does not approve of those who believe in force and neglect reason. We should fully defend Western civilization, which is based on love of freedom, aspires to respect life, and respects the belief in freedom of creation. Some people are making malicious propaganda about France, claiming that we are about to fall into the abyss of communism and cannot extricate ourselves. This kind of statement is not worth a knowledgeable person's smile. I dare to assure you that France is prepared to cooperate with Britain. France's friendship with the British people has never been deeper than it is today, and you can be comforted by this. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Maintaining World Peace Is a Common Goal of Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt Publishes an Article, Britain Expresses Willingness to Strive for Peace</p>
<p>[New York] The British King's Coronation special issue published by the Christian Science Monitor here today contains an article by President Roosevelt, which states that Britain and the United States have a common purpose, which is to maintain peace throughout the world. This common purpose has always existed, like a common inspiration. Peace cannot be demanded, but can be achieved through hard work. Civilians everywhere in the civilized world do not want to live in peace with each other. The maintenance of peace also depends on the unanimous support of newspapers around the world.

<h3>Lansbury Returns from Germany</h3>
<p>Hoping to Meet with Italian Prime Minister to Discuss Peace Plan</p>
<p>[London] British Labour MP Lansbury, after meeting with German leader Hitler in Berlin as a peace envoy, returned to Dover today and issued two statements to journalists, saying that he hopes to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to discuss his world peace plan. Now, he has met with all the major European and American politicians. He returned to the country with a belief that the tragedy of war that will be inflicted on the world can be averted. He believes that the world is now gradually abandoning its warlike spirit. The world is currently on the edge of a cliff, but at least he can say that in the last five days, he has not seen anyone who does not want peace. He and German leader Hitler both understand that the future is not without difficulties, but they all believe that these difficulties can be resolved in good faith. Today's Non-Intervention Committee has proved that the round table conference of representatives of various countries to discuss extremely important issues can avoid encountering real obstacles and make the conference fruitless. In Berlin, it was suggested to him that the Non-Intervention Committee might continue to meet in order to discuss the feasibility of convening a world peace conference.

<h3>German Perspective</h3>
<p>US, French and Belgian Staff Conference is Preparing a Plan Against Germany</p>
<p>[Berlin] German General Major-General Metz Black published an article in the Berlin Daily today, explaining the German perspective on the upcoming consultation in Beijing between Britain, France and Belgium. The article is clearly aimed at British Foreign Secretary Eden's upcoming visit to Belgium. According to public information, Britain and France are now seeking to obtain some form of understanding with the Belgian General Staff. In his article, Metz first stated that the consultations of the staff departments of the three countries are contradictory to the issue of neutrality. True neutrality does not require joint consultations with the staff departments of neighboring countries, and the purpose of the consultations is only to anticipate a common enemy and prepare for a response plan. In other words, the consultations of the staff departments of Britain, France and Belgium are irrelevant to the issue of neutrality and are merely anticipating Germany as a common enemy. After the publication of this article, military and political figures here have paid great attention. (National Maritime Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Montreux Conference Making Rapid Progress</h3>
<p>Egypt Abolishes Consular Jurisdiction, Two Technical Issues Remain to be Resolved</p>
<p>⊙Montreux: The current Egyptian consular jurisdiction conference is now making rapid progress, which is the opposite of what was predicted a week ago. France's previous strong attitude has greatly eased after the French chief representative Tedson returned home to ask for instructions. After Ted returned from France, he had a banquet and a long talk with Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas Pasha. Optimists say that the conference is expected to be resolved quickly before the coronation of the British King. The technical issues that remain to be resolved are as follows: ㊀How to supplement the vacancies of foreign judges in the Mixed Courts during the transition period, ㊁The status of nationals and protected persons, ㊂The Egyptian Minister of Justice should consult with the Mixed Courts when announcing judicial regulations. Furthermore, the harmonious relationship between Britain and Egypt at this conference is quite remarkable. Egypt praised the UK for adhering to the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, and the Egyptian representatives enthusiastically agreed with any suggestions made by the British side, which reduced a lot of concerns among other representatives. British consular representative Wallace told reporters today that Britain now has two missions. On the one hand, the UK is one of the countries with consular jurisdiction, and on the other hand, it is a party to the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and helps Egypt get rid of the shackles of surrender treaties. He said that the interests of British merchants in Egypt would not suffer losses, and he did not believe that Egypt would discriminate against foreigners after the end of the transition period.

<h3>British All Sectors Actively Transporting Food to Aid the Civilians of the Port of Bilbao</h3>
<p>[London] British trade unions donated 200 tons of grain and handed them over to the British ship "Bakewitz" to be transported to the port of Bilbao, Spain, to aid the besieged soldiers and civilians there. Other organizations, such as the Friends Church, the Spanish Medical Aid Association, etc., raised £2,000 to purchase food and medical supplies, which were also handed over to the ship. Former Prime Minister Lloyd George contributed £250 and attached a short note saying, "I am a Basque, and General Foch is also a Basque. The Welsh and Basques are of the same race." The "Bakewitz" is piloted by Captain Russell and is expected to set sail on Saturday or Sunday. British warships will escort it to the three-mile limit. Several British MPs are now planning to board the ship to Bilbao. After unloading the goods, the ship will transport refugees, women and children to Britain or France.

<h3>Three British Merchant Ships Break Through the Blockade Line</h3>
<p>⊙Saint-Jean-de-Luz: The British merchant ships "Stanbrook," "Macgregor," and "Hansterly" successively left this port in the dark of night yesterday to head for Bilbao. The ships only showed a faint light. The three ships risked danger and broke through the Nationalist blockade line, delivering the food they were carrying to the garrison. The 42,100-ton British battlecruiser "Hood" and other warships outside the port exchanged signals with each other, indicating that the ships knew the actions of the three ships. Today, three port workers arrived here from Bilbao to serve as pilots for the three ships. According to Nationalist leader General Franco, he has threatened to stop British grain ships from entering the port of Bilbao, even if it means starting a war with the British Navy. He has also secretly laid mines in the port of Bilbao. Therefore, the three British ships currently heading to Bilbao are not only in danger of being sunk by Nationalist warships but also in danger of being blown up by contact mines. From an international observation point of view, a conflict between British warships and Nationalist warships may be unavoidable, and the situation will become more serious.

<h3>Japanese Political Exposition Displays Heartbreaking Chinese Materials</h3>
<p>Overview of the Manchukuo Puppet Organization: Japan's Control of the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Tokyo Special Dispatch: The Japanese Political Exposition was held in Hibiya on the 30th, displaying political materials and models from various countries. The reporter visited on the 14th, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Exposition Venue</p>
<p>The entire venue is very large, divided into eleven pavilions: Constitution, Figures, Army, Navy, Diplomacy, Foreign Countries, Overseas Territories, Transportation, Local Areas, Collaboration, and "Manchukuo." The eastern part of the lower floor houses the Local Pavilion, the House of Peers Meeting Hall, the Transportation Pavilion, offices, and a cafeteria. The western part houses the Collaboration Pavilion, the House of Representatives Meeting Hall, offices, and a guard room. The eastern part of the upper floor houses the Figures Pavilion, the House of Peers Meeting Hall, the "Manchukuo Pavilion," and the Army Pavilion. The central part houses the Constitution Pavilion and the Overseas Territories Pavilion. The western part houses the Foreign Countries Pavilion, the House of Representatives Meeting Hall, the Navy Pavilion, the Diplomacy area, and a rest area. The exhibits in each pavilion have their own value, but Chinese compatriots studying in Japan who visit the "Manchukuo Pavilion" all feel that it is a crystallization of sorrow and cannot help but shed tears.</p>
<p>Heartbreaking Organization</p>
<p>The "Manchukuo Pavilion" contains many materials, all related to the political situation of the puppet organization after September 18th. These are materials that compatriots in the motherland should know but are not easy to obtain. In terms of political organization, its governance methods are as follows: The highest ruler is the puppet emperor, followed by ⑴ the puppet State Council, ⑵ the puppet Imperial Household Agency, ⑶ the puppet Palace Affairs Office, ⑷ the puppet Privy Council, ⑸ the puppet General's Office, ⑹ the puppet Military Attache Office, ⑺ the puppet Legislative Yuan, ⑻ the puppet State Council Advisors, ⑼ the puppet Control Yuan, ⑽ the puppet Supreme Court, and ⑾ the puppet Supreme Audit Office. The organization of the puppet State Council is the most complex, divided into a "Bureau, a Court, five Bureaus, and nine Departments," namely the General Affairs Bureau, the Continental Scientific Academy, the Construction and Supply Bureau, the Awards Bureau, the National Highway Bureau, the National Capital Construction Bureau, the Land Registration Bureau, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Mongolian Affairs. Each department is further divided into divisions and offices. Except for the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Mongolian Affairs, the rest are divided into divisions but have no offices. The Ministry of Civil Affairs is divided into six divisions and twelve offices, with the six divisions being the General Affairs Division, the Local Affairs Division, the Reclamation Division, the Police Affairs Division, the Civil Engineering Division, and the Health Division. The twelve offices are the Jilin Provincial Office, the Xinjing (Changchun) Special Municipality Office, the Longjiang Provincial Office, the Heihe Provincial Office, the Sanjiang Provincial Office, the Binjiang Provincial Office, the Jiandao Provincial Office, the Andong Provincial Office, the Fengtian Provincial Office, the Jinzhou Provincial Office, the Rehe Provincial Office, and the Harbin Special Municipality Office. The Ministry of Mongolian Affairs is divided into the General Affairs Civil Affairs, the Industry Promotion, and three divisions, and the Xing'an East Province, Xing'an West Province, Xing'an South Province, and Xing'an North Province four offices. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is divided into the General Affairs, Commerce, Political Affairs, and Propaganda four divisions. The Ministry of Military Affairs is divided into the Horse Administration, the General Staff, and the Military Supplies three divisions and a part of the Military Investigation Department. The Ministry of Finance is divided into the General Affairs, Taxation, and Financial Administration three divisions. The Ministry of Industry is divided into the General Affairs, Agriculture, Forestry, Mining, and Commerce five divisions. The Ministry of Transportation is divided into the General Affairs, Railways, and Shipping three divisions. The Ministry of Justice is divided into the General Affairs, Civil Affairs, Criminal Affairs, and Execution four divisions. The Ministry of Education is divided into the General Affairs, Academic Affairs, and Etiquette three divisions. The materials in each court, department, office, bureau, and office mostly contain texts expressing sincerity and gratitude to Japan and management plans. Although the highest leaders of each agency are from Northeast China, the real power is in the hands of Japanese advisors. Those who work diligently and do not discuss right and wrong not only receive the grace of having their lives preserved but can also receive a dry salary of more than 100 yuan per month. The general puppet officials, as docile as sheep, bow their heads and fulfill their duties within the prescribed scope. If they don't use opium, they use morphine. This is the so-called sheep-like life.</p>
<p>Japanese Rule</p>
<p>Japan is doing everything possible to rule Manchuria. It is also necessary to pay attention to Japan's political organization in Manchuria. Its organization is as follows: Under the Prime Minister of the Japanese Cabinet, there is ⑴ the President of the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs, concurrently held by the Minister of the Army, ⑵ the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Manchuria, concurrently held by the Commander of the Kwantung Army, ⑶ the Commander of the Kwantung Army Headquarters. The organization of the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs is simple. Under the Embassy to Manchuria is the Kwantung Bureau, with one Director-General, divided into halls, bureaus, offices, and departments: (1) Fengtian Relief Center, (2) Exchange, (3) Observatory, (4) Kwantung Government, (5) Police Station, (6) High Court, (7) District Court, (8) High Court Prosecutor's Office, (9) Postal Bureau, (10) Prison, (11) Maritime Bureau, (12) Monopoly Bureau, (13) College of Engineering, (14) Police Officer Training School, (15) Secretariat (with one Chief), (16) Administrative Department (with one Director), (17) Police Department (with one Director, concurrently held by the Commander of the Military Police), (18) Supervisory Department (with one Director, concurrently held by the Director of Military Traffic Supervision). The Kwantung Government is very large in scale, divided into the Secretariat, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Police Department, the Civil Administration Office, the Police Station, the Museum, the Dalian Fire Department, the Agricultural Experiment Station, the Horse Breeding Station, the Library, the Institute of Physical Education, the Fisheries Experiment Station, the Salt Industry Experiment Station, the Dalian Relief Center, the Lushun Hospital, the Women's Hospital, the Lushun Sanatorium, the Dalian Sanatorium, the Middle School, the Lushun Girls' High School, the Dalian Girls' High School, the Lushun Higher Public School, the Dalian Industrial School, the Lushun Home Economics Girls' School, the Dalian Home Economics Girls' School, the Dalian Higher School, the Jinzhou Agricultural School, and the Dalian School for the Deaf and Dumb. The Kwantung Army Headquarters has one Commander of the Kwantung Army, with considerable power, who is a trustee of the military. Under him are the General Staff, advisors, the Military Traffic Supervision Department (with one Director), and the Military Police Headquarters (with one Commander). Japan's political organization in Manchuria is more rigorous than the East India Company. Its purpose is to seek a so-called permanent unification of Japan and Manchuria. (14th)</p>
<h3>Construction of Fuzhou Tap Water</h3>
<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony Held at Longtan Mountain; First Phase of Project to be Completed by the End of Next Year</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fuzhou, the provincial capital of Fujian Province, has been deliberating the construction of tap water since before 1929, but it did not materialize. In 1934, the provincial government was reorganized, and attention was paid to it. Chen Ticheng of the Construction Department proposed fundraising methods, which were approved by the provincial government and received a remaining fund of 26,000 yuan from the provincial defense donation to start preparations. Later, due to limited funds, in accordance with Article 2 of the National Government's promotion methods, the Construction Department used the Minhou deed tax and the provincial capital's vehicle donation and other construction project income as collateral to issue 900,000 yuan in tap water public bonds, which were approved by the provincial government and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<p>When the preparatory office was established, the project was divided into two phases. The first phase planned to supply water to Nantai, the commercial center, and neighboring areas (with a water volume sufficient for 150,000 people). It was best to take water from the upper reaches of the northern branch of the Yuejiang River as the water source. However, since the first phase was limited to the Nantai area, it was appropriate to choose a location near that area for the intake, and it must not be affected by changes in the waterway. Therefore, it was decided to take Longtan Mountain as the water source for the first phase. Preliminary plans and the first phase of water supply engineering were immediately drafted and submitted for approval. The Central Trust Bureau was entrusted to handle the procurement procedures, and letters were sent to various companies and foreign firms, instructing them to contact the Trust Bureau directly, with price lists sent directly to the Construction Department for review. At that time, a total of 29 companies received the drawings, but only three submitted quotations. Among them, only Siemens, Mitsui, and Mitsubishi were close to the budget. Therefore, the Construction Department submitted a report to Chairman Chen, who instructed Mitsubishi to re-draft the engineering layout so as not to exceed 600,000 yuan. After several consultations, detailed designs by tap water experts were studied and reduced to 599,700 yuan after repeated reductions. After obtaining the consent of the head office and the official signing of the approved issuance of construction public bonds, construction could begin. However, before long, copper prices soared more than doubled, and the prices of machinery and raw materials also increased by more than 200,000 yuan, and the project almost became a pie in the sky. Fortunately, the public bonds had been approved by the central government, and the Central Trust Bureau had also agreed on a method of advancing funds, and the equipment was slightly changed. Finally, on April 5th of this year, a formal contract was signed in Shanghai at the original price, and the first installment of 200,000 yuan was paid immediately. The groundbreaking ceremony was held at Longtan Mountain on the 14th of this month. The venue was beautifully decorated on that day. Around 2 p.m., people from all walks of life participated one after another, including Chairman Chen, members of the party and government, leaders from all walks of life, and foreign guests, totaling more than 500 people. The Director of the Construction Department presided over the meeting, reported on the progress, and hoped that it would be completed in a year and a half. Next, the Chairman gave a speech, and the representative of the Provincial Party Headquarters gave a speech. After the ceremony, Chairman Chen, Chen Ticheng, Gao Dengting, Si Lie, Zheng Zhenwen, Chen Jinglie, and others personally took up shovels and performed the groundbreaking ceremony. The ceremony was completed at 4 p.m.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Smuggling of Steel Discovered</h3>
<p>The Huangbudun Police Station of the County Police Bureau's Water Police Team found a large boat unloading goods from Suzhou to Zhenjiang the day before yesterday, containing 430 dan and 76 jin of scrap copper and iron. Because there was no passport from the Ministry of Military Affairs, it was detained, and the boat owner, He Xingfa, was taken to the station and transferred to the general bureau. Yesterday, he was transferred to the county government for interrogation. Section Chief Li held a court session to interrogate him. According to his confession, the owner of the goods was named Wang Zonghai, who lived in the New World Hotel. The county government temporarily released He Xingfa on bail and summoned the owner of the goods, Wang Naihai, to the case for interrogation. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the provincial government to request instructions on how to handle it.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Old Meng River Turns into a Lake</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County Government reported on the 22nd via telegram from Zhu Tianying, the district chief of the third district and director of the Old Meng River dredging project, stating that the project ordered to dredge the Old Meng River had started on the 6th of this month, and the project was progressing smoothly. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 20th, there was a windstorm and heavy rain that lasted all night. The fields along the river had no embankments or surrounding roads. Once rainwater accumulated, there was no way to stop it. In addition, mountain floods poured down, and the fields within a radius of 40 li around were turned into lakes. The overflowing on both banks could not be stopped, and human power could not prevent it, etc. According to the telegram, the county government, in addition to forwarding a telegram to the Construction Department to request instructions, will also send personnel to the countryside for inspection.</p>
<h3>Dinghai: New Technician Appointed at Aquatic Products Farm</h3>
<p>The position of technician at the Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic Products Farm is extremely important. After the establishment of the farm, Director Chen Tongbai had chosen from many candidates and appointed Chen Chunshou, Lin Shuyan, and Wu Zhongyuan as technicians, all of whom were famous and rare aquatic product talents in the country. Recently, technician Wu Zhongyuan resigned due to personal reasons. After a period of investigation to recruit a replacement, Zhang Yuandi, the principal of the Hebei Aquatic Products Vocational School, introduced Wang Yiguan, the top graduate of the school's vocational program, who had studied fisheries and aquaculture in Japan at public expense and obtained an excellent degree, to serve as a technician at the farm. It is reported that Wang spent more than four years studying in Japan. After graduating, he continued to engage in advanced research in the special department of the Tokyo Fisheries Training Institute in Japan. He worked extremely hard on weekdays and wrote a lot, which was highly praised by experts in the country. After Wang received the appointment approved by the Construction Department, he has already taken a ship from Japan via Shanghai and transferred to the farm to take office. With the assistance of this expert, the farm will surely make more contributions in the future.</p>
<p>Detailed Report on the Wind Disaster Tragedy</p>
<p>A sudden gale hit the ocean surface of Shengshan the day before yesterday, causing great damage to fishing boats of various gangs. It is impossible to count the number of those who had their masts broken, rudders broken, oars lost, and anchors lost, colliding and drifting. According to the investigation, seven fishing boats were overturned, and 68 people drowned as a result. Fishing has been suspended for five days, and the loss in material production is difficult to estimate for the time being. As for those who were killed by the overturning of boats, there was one Wang Gongyu net boat from Baihushan Mouth, Shenjiamen, with seven deaths, one Yan Yongfu net boat from the Hu Gang, with seven deaths, one Hao Lin net boat, with seven deaths, one Xin Yuting net boat, with seven deaths, one A Lin net boat, with seven deaths, one Zhang family fishing boat, with six deaths, and one Aoshan mid-way boat, with twenty-seven deaths.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Preparing to Organize Oil Conversion Experiment Site</h3>
<p>Ding Meihe, a citizen of Yin County, in view of the fact that the kerosene needed daily in our country is all supplied by foreign oceans, which is a huge leak, and in order to counteract it, he has devoted himself to research and has gained a lot of experience in recent years. He now plans to set up a factory for experiments, named the China Oil Conversion Experiment Site. The raw material is diesel oil, which is chemically tested in the field using scientific methods. The oil converted is called chemical artificial oil, and the amount and price used are reduced compared to the original kerosene. He has already submitted an application to the county government for registration and will open the site after submitting it to the province for approval and obtaining a permit.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Terrible Smallpox Epidemic</h3>
<p>The climate in this county has been cold and hot recently, resulting in a smallpox epidemic. The Education Bureau has specially dispatched health instructor Jin Weifan to various schools to vaccinate students to avoid infection. The county hospital also provides free vaccinations.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: Railway Bureau Organizes Investigation Team</h3>
<p>In order to understand the economic conditions of various places along the line, the Jinpu Railway Bureau has specially organized an investigation team, divided into four groups, and appointed Chen Peiyu as the leader to lead all personnel to various provinces, cities, and counties along the line for field investigation. The areas in northern Anhui include Quanjiao, Chuxian, Lai'an, Jiashan, Xuyi, Sixian, Wuhe, Dingyuan, Chaoxian, Liu'an, Huoqiu, Fuyang, Taihe, Haoxian, Guoyang, Mengcheng, Lingbi, Suxian, Huaiyuan, Fengyang, Yingshang, Shou County, Fengtai, Zhengyang, Suixi, Bengbu, and 26 counties and towns. All agricultural, mineral, forest, livestock, industrial, commercial, and real industries, as well as boat, vehicle transportation, and local products, are included in the investigation.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Yunnan Journey (4)</h3>
<p>— Beibeiquan</p>
<p>The weapons of the conscripted soldiers in Jiangxi Province are all spears (i.e., long spears). A few of the spear shafts still have red, green, and black spiral patterns, similar to the patterns on a barber shop sign. This is probably from ten years ago and can be seen among those who were coerced and have returned to reform themselves. The conscripted soldiers along the way mostly have pale faces due to lack of nutrition, resembling the haggard appearance of the blocked areas a few years ago. However, school-age children have a better complexion, which shows that food is the most important thing for the people. The burden of revitalizing the new Jiangxi in the future should be placed on their shoulders.</p>
<p>Gao'an has a population of over 400,000, with more women than men, probably because the strong men have scattered in all directions. Gao'an was once the prefectural city of Suizhou and has a good literary style. Recently, legislator Peng Chunshi is also from Han Gao'an. Peng is the son-in-law of Wei Zonghan. A few years ago, Duan Qirui and Chiang Kai-shek communicated and exchanged feelings through Peng. He is the only talent in Gao'an.</p>
<p>In the evening, we arrived in Wanzai. Wanzai is a ramie cloth producing area. In the past, it was sold abroad, with an annual value of over 10 million yuan. Since Korea used Japanese cloth, exports have sharply decreased. The bandit rebellion destroyed the almost extinct profession. Although it has recovered slightly recently, it is less than one-tenth of its former state. The year before last, a student named Ni was sent to factories such as Mengques in the UK to specialize in the study of ramie cloth. It is hoped that after his return, a large-scale ramie cloth factory will be jointly operated by officials and merchants. Mr. Ni is probably going to be Jiangxi's second Du Chongyuan.</p>
<p>That night, the world-renowned Wang Baochuan, Mr. Xiong Shi'yi, arrived from Nanchang and joined our ranks along the way. Mr. Xiong is a handsome young man in a blue shirt and black jacket, looking like a young master. It is unknown that he has already traveled around half the globe. The place where we stayed was the east and west sesame of the Confucius Temple. While colleagues were tidying up their beds, someone joked, "We are now qualified to be enshrined in Nishan." Someone else said, "Although we are disturbing Confucius for one night tonight, the temple has been renewed because of our transit. Confucius certainly won't mind our presence." (It is said that Wanzai's hospitality and renovation of the city appearance cost 3,000 yuan from the province and 2,000 yuan from the local area. It is quite harsh to ask the people to bear 2,000 yuan in a town that has been robbed).</p>
<p>Originally, the tour of academic groups and the local inspection of officials of the central government are extremely common. It is best not to have local supply, because supply will labor the people, and the conscripted soldiers lining up for two or three hundred miles is laboring the people. Especially during the busy farming season, every moment is gold. Although the provincial authorities want to be too good, it is a great loss to the people. Even those who receive it feel ashamed and blush and show a shrunken state. As for requisitioning civilians to carry luggage without paying them, it is even more uneasy. Other things, such as lighting more than 100,000 firecrackers, who will compensate for this consumption? The people of Jiangxi have just realized the cruelty and deception of the Soviets and have returned to reform themselves. Now, encountering the supplies and arrangements for the passage of this "bourgeois" group, wouldn't it add some bad impressions?</p>
<p>The ninth day (April 13th), we set off from Wanzai, passed through Shangqu City, and passed Dongfeng, which is the border between Jiangxi and Hunan. Since then, we entered Hunan Province. The population density has greatly increased, and the land is full of rice fields. There are tree planting areas next to the highway. Because we heard the night before that more than 100 armed people had passed through the boundary between Wan and Liu, it was unknown whether they were civilians or bandits. A regiment of troops was dispatched in advance to guard. At noon, we arrived at Dayaoshi in Liuyang, the birthplace of Tan Sitong and Tang Caichang (Tang Youwang is the second son of Caichang). The villages are mostly aristocratic families with excellent culture. At noon, we arrived in Liuyang and crossed a 200-foot river. The bridge has not yet been completed. The entire county of Liuyang has a population of over 800,000, and the urban and rural population is over 60,000. The city streets are prosperous, and schools and public undertakings have everything. It is the richest county in Hunan Province. We had lunch at the Confucius Temple. The provincial authorities advocate ancient music and have compiled a dance troupe in Liuyang. All the Zhou system, metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, leather, wood, and pottery instruments such as bells and Yu are complete. The pavilions, terraces, and roof ridges of the temple are all built with blue and white porcelain tiles from the Daoguang era. The Confucius Temple is exquisite. Except for Qufu, I am afraid there is no place so exquisite. The main cadres of the ancient music bureau led sixty-four dancers, wearing sacrificial clothes, such as the Shangding Ceremony, and performed the Eight Yi Dance in the courtyard. All the musical instruments played together, and the tone was solemn. People said that Chairman He Yunqiao advocated restoration. We said that this is not too much to blame. Ancient music may as well be preserved.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the highway between Liuyang and Changsha was flat, and the bridges were all changed to culverts. Tens of thousands of paulownia trees were planted along the road, which have been four or five years old. Now the paulownia flowers are in full bloom, mixed with new willows and poplars, forming shade along the road. The scenery all the way is really beautiful. Our head of the group, Chu Minyi, and Mr. Xiong Shi'yi took the 14th car for half the journey. Someone joked that Wang Baochuan and Sima Yi were traveling to Changsha in the same car. Xiong became famous in England for writing Wang Baochuan, and Chu played Sima Yi at a charity event last year, hence this wonderful metaphor. However, it is a bit disrespectful to both Chu and Xiong. The recorder can only apologize here.</p>
<p>Shenshi (3-5 pm) and the Xiangjiang ferry were very fast. We changed to ferry to enter Changsha City. The local authorities provided tea and refreshments at the Public National Defense Club to wait for the arrival of luggage. We were assigned to stay and rest. In the evening, Director Fu of the Construction Department, who is from Yu籍, hosted a banquet at the Sanhe Restaurant. It was raining heavily, the first time we had encountered rain in the nine days of our trip, and it was after arriving in Changsha, which can be counted as a smooth trip.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Left Zhongshan Hospital Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The dental work went very well; Zhang Qun and Yu Hongjun paid their respects in the morning.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang entered Zhongshan Hospital for a physical examination. As a result, several diseased teeth were discovered with pus inside. To prevent it from affecting other parts of his health, two teeth were extracted on the 22nd. The procedure went very well. Although he felt a slight pain after the extraction, he had recovered by the 23rd. Zhang Qun, Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, and Yu Hongjun, Acting Mayor of Shanghai, went to the hospital together to inquire yesterday morning. Chairman Chiang then left the hospital at 12:30 pm, accompanied by his wife, Madam Soong Mei-ling, Qian Dajun, Director of the Adjutant's Office, and Huang Renlin, Director-General of the Lixingshe, and went straight back to his private residence on Jia'erye Avenue to rest.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui Discharged from Hospital Yesterday After Recovery</h3>
<p>Will Not Go to Nanjing for the Time Being</p>
<p>Member of the Central Supervisory Committee, Mr. Wu Zhihui, was injured in a car accident in Ningbo and returned to Shanghai to be hospitalized for treatment. He has now recovered and was discharged from the hospital yesterday morning, returning to his private residence on Huanlong Road. Yesterday afternoon, he went to the International Library on Avenue Joffre to inspect and handle the affairs of the China Association for International Cultural Cooperation and participated in the tea party hosted by Central Supervisory Committee Member Li Shizeng to entertain the former French Governor-General of Annam. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency met Mr. Wu yesterday and saw that he had recovered his health and was in good spirits, but there was still some rubber plaster on the wound on his forehead. He told the reporter that he was only injured on his forehead and the injury was very minor, so he recovered in a few days. He is currently staying in Shanghai for rest, and the date of his trip to Nanjing is undecided.</p>
<h3>President Yu of the Control Yuan Changes Place to Avoid Birthday Celebrations</h3>
<p>This month's 30th is President Yu's birthday. In recent days, it has been rumored that the Control Yuan and its subordinate agencies are discussing holding birthday celebrations for Mr. Yu and raising funds to build a library. Mr. Yu sent telegrams to Nanjing the day before yesterday, resolutely refusing, saying that national revival should be worked on from a practical point of view, and if this trend is started in this court, the whole country will follow suit, then how will it end? Mr. Yu came to Shanghai with a leg disease some days ago. In order to avoid birthday celebrations, he decided to change places for recuperation in the near future and abolish all ceremonies, and even praise and flattering articles will never be accepted.</p>
<h3>Supervisors Going to Guizhou Report Serious Disaster Situation in Guizhou</h3>
<p>Victims All Eat Grass Roots and Tree Bark; Telegrams Request All Parties to Solicit Relief</p>
<p>The drought in Guizhou Province is very serious. In addition to the Ministry of Finance allocating 100,000 yuan in relief funds to Guizhou, the Executive Yuan has also sent a special commissioner, Cheng Jingsheng, to Guizhou for investigation. Charity organizations in the city received a telegram from Mr. Cheng yesterday, requesting them to solicit donations from all parties to provide relief. The original telegram said, (excerpt) The drought in Guizhou Province is very serious. I, Jingsheng, was sent by the Executive Yuan to Guizhou to supervise the relief efforts. I rushed to Guizhou and inspected along the way. I arrived in the counties on the 20th. The counties have not had a drop of rain for several months, the land is cracked, and the spring harvest is hopeless. The victims all eat mineral-quality Guanyin powder and tree bark and grass roots as food, their faces are pale, and they are not covered in clothes. People are like hell, the tragedy is unbearable. Moreover, the number of cattle being transported and driven on the left side of the road is innumerable. Agricultural work has been abandoned, and the disaster area covers almost the entire province. The severely affected areas reach 41 counties, most of which are about to die. Although the central government has allocated money and the provincial government has implemented measures, the disaster is serious and the money is insufficient. Chairman Gu, Brigade Commander Cao, and the officials of the provincial government are planning day and night, sighing and looking up at the roof. Guizhou Province is located on the border, surrounded by mountains, and is known for its barrenness. The livelihood is rooted in it, but the folk customs are honest and the physique is strong. The bravery and fighting skills and the spirit of self-reliance are unmatched by other provinces. The provincial government has guided them appropriately, so they can deeply understand patriotism, are trained properly, and will soon be the choice of the country. If they are allowed to fall into the ditches, the loss after the disaster will be a great loss to the country. It is not only unbearable to be indifferent. When the time comes when the green and yellow crops are not connected, it is even more a matter of life and death. Now I am discussing concrete measures with the provincial government to rush to handle emergency work, and give aid to grain. However, the approximate statistics, in addition to the allocated public bonds, at least 1 million yuan in cash must be raised to start. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan requesting additional allocations, I also ask you to think about the victims in the border areas and generously call on charity organizations at home and abroad and people of justice to help quickly and provide assistance to the isolated leaders. Tears and words, I look forward to your kind response. Cheng Jingsheng respectfully.</p>
<h3>Actively Carrying Out the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Project</h3>
<p>Expected to be Fully Completed Before the End of August</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau commenced the construction of the Hangzhou-Cao'e section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line, although various engineering works have been slightly delayed, they are expected to be completed before the Qianjiang River Bridge opens to traffic by the end of August. The current status of the various projects is as follows: ⑴ The earthwork and stonework for the entire line's roadbed have been significantly affected by continuous rainfall since the beginning of spring. Approximately 70% of the work has now been completed. The engineering office is currently preparing small steel rails, flatcars, barges, and other tools and is employing over a thousand workers to work day and night. If the weather improves, the project can be completed by mid-June. ⑵ The earthwork for the stations, except for Xiaoshan and Shaoxing stations, has been over 80% completed. ⑶ All seventy-seven small bridges on the entire section were initially planned to be completed by the end of last month. However, due to the poor soil quality of the bridge foundations, the foundation piling work had to be changed, resulting in a slight extension of the completion date compared to the original contract. Most of the work has now been completed, and the construction of wing walls and the dredging of river channels are underway. It is expected that all will be completed this month. ⑷ The water pipe project, except for the seven additional locations requested by various legal entities in the Shaoxing area, has been mostly completed. Only a few remaining stone masonry works for the retaining walls and wing walls remain. ⑸ The reinforced concrete caissons for the Cao'e Bridge have already been built and are being sunk using pneumatic methods. However, the ordered machinery and equipment were slightly delayed, so progress has been slower than planned. They are currently working day and night to catch up. The date of full completion will depend on the arrival date of the steel beam materials from overseas. ⑹ Tendering and construction have commenced for all station building projects along the entire line. Except for Xiaoshan Station, which started slightly later due to its connection with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the remaining stations are expected to be fully completed by around mid-July. ⑺ Track laying may need to be delayed until mid-June due to the late arrival of sleepers. Ballast has been contracted out to merchants in sections. As for the steel rails, they are being replaced on the Shanghai-Hangzhou section and transported in batches to Zhakou for transfer to various sections for use.</p>
<h3>Li Shizeng and Yu Hongjun Hosted the Former French Governor-General of Vietnam Yesterday</h3>
<p>Vanini Scheduled to Go to Nanjing This Morning</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Mr. Vanini, the former French Governor-General of Annam and current member of the French Chamber of Deputies' Socialist Party, is visiting China. Since arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, he has received a warm welcome from various Chinese and French parties. Mr. Li Shizeng held a tea party yesterday afternoon, and Deputy Mayor Yu hosted a banquet for Mr. Vanini last night. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Li's Tea Party</p>
<p>Due to his long-standing friendship with Mr. Vanini, Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Executive Committee, held a grand tea party at the World Society on Foch Road at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon to welcome Mr. and Mrs. Vanini. Those invited included the French Consul-General, the Deputy Consul-General, the Director-General of the French Concession Municipal Council, the Commissioner of Police, and prominent Chinese and foreign figures such as Wu Zhihui, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Jingjiang, Song Ziwen, Zheng Yuxiu, Mrs. Wang Liangchou, Yu Hongjun, Geng Jiaji, and Xie Shou Kang, totaling about one hundred people. Mr. Li, accompanied by his two secretaries, Mr. Cui and Mr. Li, provided attentive hospitality. The guests first toured the Encyclopedia and browsed for about a week, then enjoyed refreshments, followed by a performance of Chinese music by the Datong Music Society for entertainment. The guests and hosts were extremely delighted, and the party ended around 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Mayor's Banquet</p>
<p>Acting Mayor of this city, Mr. and Mrs. Yu Hongjun, hosted a banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Vanini at the Municipal Government Reception Center on Route Cardinal Mercier at 8:30 PM last night. Also invited were the French Consul-General Badas, Commercial Counselor Shao Xin, Military Commander Berthel, French Concession Commissioner of Police Faber, and Central Executive Committee member Li Shizeng, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Municipal Government Secretaries Geng Jiaji, Tang Shixuan, and others, totaling over twenty people. They thoroughly enjoyed themselves until around 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Going to Nanjing This Morning</p>
<p>Mr. Vanini is scheduled to travel to Nanjing by train with his wife and secretary at 8:00 AM this morning. He plans to pay his respects to Foreign Minister Wang and relevant authorities and meet with the Ambassador of that country, Mr. Nacia, for discussions. After visiting Beiping, he will return to Shanghai to await his ship and travel to Japan before returning to France via the United States.</p>
<p>Vanini's Remarks</p>
<p>According to the Foreign Affairs News Agency, the former French Governor-General of Annam, Vanini, arrived at Longhua Airport at 8:40 AM the day before yesterday by plane from Hong Kong. Many important figures from both Chinese and French communities went to the airport to welcome him. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Vanini stayed at the International Hotel. Ms. Rivieis, a female reporter from the French-language Shanghai Daily, visited him. The translated excerpt of their conversation is as follows: "In a living room filled with the national atmosphere of the English, the French and the Laoson, I (the female reporter from the French newspaper, speaking in the first person) went straight forward to talk to the former Governor Van. Because Mr. Vanini is tall, I was able to recognize him immediately in the crowded place. My first question was, 'Was the Governor's trip safe and sound?' Mr. Vanini immediately replied, 'In fact, this flight to Shanghai was not entirely successful because we landed in heavy fog, so we could see almost nothing of Shanghai in the air.' Mr. Vanini also said, 'I boarded the plane with my wife and Major Laulan at 4:00 PM last Wednesday (the 21st) from Wenzhou, but we suddenly received a report of bad weather in Shanghai and had to return. There was no train from Wenzhou to Shanghai, so we had to spend the night in Wenzhou.' Because of spending the night in Wenzhou, I was invited by a British Customs Commissioner in Wenzhou, and I was fortunate enough to meet an extremely old-fashioned Chinese person, which broadened my horizons because the Chinese people I had met before were either Europeanized or Americanized, but not purely Chinese. That night's conversation with the old Chinese man will be unforgettable for the rest of my life.'" It is reported that Mr. Vanini was previously a member of parliament, representing his hometown of Puy-de-Dome in the National Assembly for a total of twenty-six years, and from 1925 to 1928, he served as the Governor-General of Annam. Then I (the French newspaper reporter speaking in the first person) asked Governor Van when he left France and what his mission was in China. Mr. Vanini replied, "I left France last November because I was recommended by the French侨民 in Annam and Tokyo to serve as a representative to the Colonial Higher Council. Now I am traveling in the Far East as a representative to investigate the local economic situation. Regarding the economic situation in Annam, Mr. Vanini believes that Indochina has broken away from the trend of recession because rice and rubber have risen in price, so according to his speculation, a recovery of prosperity will be seen." Mr. Vanini also said, "After leaving Annam, I went to southern China, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong to inspect." According to Mr. Vanini himself, this is his first time visiting China, because when Van was the Governor-General, it was the era of the Chinese Revolution and civil war. However, according to his observations this year, everything in China has progressed, and construction is particularly significant. Today, traveling in southern China is almost as convenient as traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo. Mr. Vanini claimed that the purpose of his visit to China was to promote economic cooperation between China and Indochina, because China and Vietnam are adjacent to each other, and organized cooperation would be beneficial to both parties. After staying in Shanghai for a short time, I heard that he will go to Nanjing and Beiping to meet with the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Qiana. Afterwards, he will have to come to Shanghai again and stay for a week. After inspecting China, Van will return to France via Japan and the United States to report on his mission. According to Mr. Vanini, he will give a long speech the next time he comes to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Baker Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Reports Severe Disaster in Sichuan</p>
<p>Mr. Baker, the General Secretary of the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee, has returned to Shanghai by China National Aviation Corporation plane the day before yesterday, having completed his trip to Sichuan to inspect the drought situation and work with the Sichuan branch to carry out relief measures. According to Mr. Baker's conversation with the reporter of the Xinxin News Agency, the disaster situation in Sichuan is extremely tragic. In addition to the emergency relief work, which is being actively handled by Zhu Ziqiao, Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, work relief is also very important. When he was in Sichuan, he advocated to the Sichuan Provincial Government that work relief should be implemented as soon as possible so that the victims would not starve to death because they had work. Therefore, the Sichuan Provincial Government has ordered each county to gather young and strong victims to engage in the construction of ponds and canals that are beneficial to agriculture, with each owner providing food rations, or building roads and dredging rivers, with the local government providing food rations. The provincial government also allocated 2.39 million yuan to build the Jianqu section of the Sichuan-Hubei Road and the Luzhou-Longchang section of the Sichuan-Guizhou Road. This work relief method is the best way for local construction and disaster relief. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Engineering Bureau has also decided to use 4 million yuan for work relief, which can probably be realized. However, I hope that the entire railway can start construction as soon as possible so that a large number of victims can get jobs to maintain their livelihoods. As for the food problem, there is also a regulatory plan. The provincial government will borrow 1 million yuan from the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to purchase and hoard sweet potatoes and rice in Chongqing and Wanxian for various counties to purchase. In addition, it will borrow 2 million yuan from the silver industry to set up a fund for fair grain sales in various counties. At the end of his remarks, Mr. Baker said that the committee is appealing to all parties, hoping that all sectors will donate generously. The American New York Famine Relief Committee is launching a fundraising campaign to relieve the Sichuan disaster. The Canadian Methodist Church is also expanding its fundraising and has remitted 5,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>British Tram Resumed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Temporarily Not Entering the French Concession</p>
<p>The strike by workers of the British Shanghai Electric Tramways Company in the Public Concession has been resolved through the mediation of Du Yuesheng and Party and government agencies. Work has resumed yesterday morning. However, the issue of fee compensation with the French Water and Electricity Company has not been resolved, so tram services between the two concessions have been suspended. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Supervise Resumption of Work</p>
<p>The tram workers' strike was mediated the day before yesterday by Du Yuesheng in conjunction with representatives of the Party and government agencies. After agreeing on four measures, the workers were satisfied. Therefore, at 5:30 AM yesterday morning, Zhu Guilin, specially dispatched by the Social Affairs Bureau, and Lu Yinchu, dispatched by the Municipal Party Headquarters, went to the Bickell Road factory on Hart Road to supervise the workers. At 6:00 AM, all trams were dispatched and work resumed.</p>
<p>French Fee Compensation Not Yet Resolved</p>
<p>However, the British Tramways Company has not complied with the agreement to compensate the French Water and Electricity Company for the losses caused by the strike. Therefore, except for trams on routes 1, 3, 6, 7, 11, and 12 (tram cars) and route 20 (trolley buses), which operate on their original routes, trams on routes 2, 4, and 8 all stop at Waihongjing Bridge. Routes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 all stop at Avenue Edward VII. The section in the French Concession has been suspended. Routes 4, 5, and 18 in the French Concession turn around at the Bund and Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>Temporary Buses Connect Route 5</p>
<p>Because French Concession route 5 trams have stopped coming north, the British Tramways Company has drawn one tram from each route of the tram cars, named route 5, to run exclusively between the North Railway Station and Dongxin Bridge to connect with French Concession route 5 for the convenience of citizens taking the North Railway Station train. The two companies are currently in negotiations and may resolve the issue today to fully restore services.</p>
<p>Trade Union Sends Letter of Thanks to Du Yuesheng</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Three-District Water and Electricity Trade Union has reported the resumption of work to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau for record. At the same time, they expressed gratitude for Du Yuesheng's efforts in mediation and financial assistance for losses, and sent a letter of thanks. Yesterday afternoon at 8:00 PM, the Improvement of Treatment Promotion Association of the trade union held a meeting to discuss the distribution of losses and the final accounting of income and expenditure during the strike, so that the funds can be distributed according to law after receiving the money.</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors</h3>
<p>Discussing the Yu-Fei Agreement, But No Announcement Was Issued</p>
<p>According to the China Press, the new directors of the Municipal Council have begun to work hard. The first regular meeting was held on Wednesday to consider the temporary agreement on road construction and donation collection outside the boundaries agreed upon by Deputy Mayor Lu Yu and Municipal Council Director-General Fessenden, but due to Japanese opposition, it was decided to postpone it so that the Japanese directors could carefully study the conditions. Yesterday (Thursday), the Municipal Council Board of Directors convened an emergency meeting. It was reported that Fessenden attended the meeting and personally stated the process of his conversations with Deputy Mayor Yu, so that the Board of Directors knew the truth. As for the meeting on this day, it was still like the regular meeting on Wednesday, but no formal announcement was issued. However, according to a certain person who is very close to the Chinese side, the China Press representative said that this matter has now become complicated. Judging from the current situation, because the Chinese municipal authorities recently came out to help the Municipal Council in the settlement of the Defeng Road case, they are unwilling to accept any suggestions that are slightly inferior to the conditions contained in this agreement. The Japanese are doing their best to oppose any limited agreement, that is, an agreement that only involves the collection of donations and leaves administrative matters such as medical and health matters to be handled later. Therefore, the position of the Municipal Council today is like being between water and fire, and its possible actions may be no more than one of the following two: one is to resume the strict attitude advocated by the Japanese, and the other is to express approval of the Yu-Fei agreement immediately and attach reservations, leaving the administrative matters that the Japanese particularly value to be resolved later. However, it is feared that the Japanese may not ease their attitude because of this reservation. This can be proved by the comments published in the Japanese newspapers in this city on Thursday. The translator notes that the China Press also has dissatisfied remarks about the Yu-Fei agreement and pointed out that the Municipal Council's decision to allow the Shanghai Municipal Government to come forward to resolve the labor disputes such as the tram strike is tantamount to tacitly acknowledging that the Shanghai Municipal Government has the power to negotiate all matters with the laborers in the concession. The recent successful negotiations between the Telephone Company and the Shanghai Power Company with the Shanghai Municipal Government have indeed damaged the Municipal Council's power over road construction outside the boundaries.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei and Wang Boqun left Beijing by night express last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning. Tan Zhen took the night train from Beijing the night before yesterday and got off at the North Station at about 7:00 AM yesterday morning. He went directly to his private residence on Route Massenet to rest.</p>
<h3>Minsheng Yarn Factory Resumes Operations Yesterday</h3>
<p>All Old Workers Enter the Factory</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, the Shanghai Minsheng Yarn Factory, a Chinese-owned business on Robison Road in western Shanghai, temporarily closed down in the 24th year of the Republic of China due to the decline of the yarn industry and the inability to maintain operations. However, more than 1,600 workers in the factory suddenly became unemployed and their livelihoods were at risk. In order to take care of the livelihoods of all workers, Xu Caichen, the manager of the factory, has reorganized a new industrial company, leased the original site of the Minsheng Factory, its factory foundation, and machinery, and is actively preparing to open for business. It is now ready and announced the start of operations yesterday (the 23rd). All of the old 1,600 workers have also entered the factory to work. They expressed extreme gratitude to Mr. Xu Caichen for his consideration of the workers' livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Syndicate Begins Lending Money</h3>
<p>Ping'an Wheel Borrows 18,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Fisheries Syndicate of the Ministry of Industry, many merchants have gone to apply for loans. However, the loan procedures are very strict, and the investigation and review procedures are very solemn. Therefore, the only loan that has been approved so far is the mortgage loan for the Ping'an fishing boat. The boat is a new-style fishing boat equipped with a hand-operated net. Each time it goes out fishing, it can sell for more than 1,000 yuan when it is full. Now it is lacking circulating capital, so it has borrowed from the syndicate. After applying according to law and the syndicate sending people to investigate, the loan of 18,000 yuan was approved. The term is set at one year, and interest is paid monthly.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Disaster Association Asks the Central Government to Allocate 15 Million in Public Bonds</h3>
<p>To Rescue More Than 30 Million Disaster Victims in Sichuan Province. Representatives Schedule to go to Nanjing on the 26th to Petition the Central Government</p>
<p>The Sichuan Disaster Relief Association received a telegram from Fang Xu and others yesterday, stating: "Yang Cangbai, Xie Huisheng, Xiang Qingren, and all fellow villagers: The Sichuan disaster is extremely severe and rare in a century. You gentlemen are abroad and launched relief efforts, caring for your hometown, and we deeply admire your feelings. However, the disaster area is too large, and there are too many disaster victims. Although the central and local governments have allocated 2 million in bonds, it feels like a drop in the bucket, which is really difficult to help this extraordinary disaster. Chairman Liu has telegraphed the central government, requesting that about 3 million yuan in Class B Unified Bond tickets be exchanged for the reorganization of Sichuan financial public bonds, and that the remaining annual amount of about 4 million yuan from the Wu Jian tax increase be used as a reserve to issue 15 million yuan in Sichuan disaster relief public bonds. Xu and others have also submitted a request to the central government for review and reply. Now, we earnestly request you to appeal nearby and urge early approval, then the more than 30 million disaster victims will be endlessly grateful. Urgent words, and waiting for your instructions. Fang Xu, Liu Xianrong, Yin Changling, etc." The association also replied in a telegram, stating: "The Chengdu Sichuan Relief Committee to Fang Xu and others: We have received your telegram about requesting the central government to issue disaster relief public bonds. We are also actively carrying out this matter here and have appointed representatives to go to Beijing to jointly request with fellow villagers in Beijing. In addition to the debt amount and methods proposed by the Sichuan Provincial Government, the funds owed to Sichuan Road by the Ministry of Railways can also be transferred as a fund. I hope you will investigate and notify us of the results of the petition at any time. Sichuan Disaster Relief Association." We also learned that the association has appointed Xiang Yuren, Li Qingfan, Lu Yifeng, Tang Dean, and Mei Xinru to go to Nanjing on the 26th to petition the central authorities to quickly allocate 15 million yuan in public bonds to save the disaster victims.</p>

<h3>Tin Can Industry Guild Requests Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The Tin Can Industry Guild in this city telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday regarding the abolition of consular jurisdiction, stating: "To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government: Since the opening of maritime trade, various countries have relied on their strong military power to force the signing of various unequal treaties one after another in order to achieve their political and economic aggression ambitions. The doors are wide open, sovereignty is lost, and the national situation is in danger. It is painful and angry to talk about. Among the treaties, the so-called consular jurisdiction is even more disrespectful of our country's national rights and damages our country's legal rights. Foreigners residing in China take consular jurisdiction as a talisman, and their actions are out of line, not subject to our country's legal judgments, and they are at large outside the law. The abuses are immense and have a huge impact. Now that unification has been completed and national power has been shaken far and wide, we should follow the teachings of the Prime Minister, display the spirit of revolution, and decisively abolish the consular jurisdiction of various countries in our country, and then abolish all unequal treaties. This is the fortune of the country and the blessing of the nation. We cannot express our urgent prayers in a telegram. Zhang Qingfa, Wu Renji, and Sun Wengang, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Tin Can Industry Guild, respectfully."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Transportation Rectifies Naval Officer Conduct</h3>
<p>Orders China Merchants Bureau to Strictly Punish Wrongdoers</p>
<p>Since its reorganization in the spring of last year, the state-run China Merchants Bureau has repeatedly received announcements from President Jiang of the Executive Yuan and instructions from the Ministry of Transportation to thoroughly rectify and eliminate long-standing malpractices. Over the past year, illegal and unethical practices such as privately carrying goods, extorting alcohol money, privately collecting illicit fees, and engaging in corruption have been strictly prohibited. Whenever discovered, the offenders are severely punished according to the law. This has been implemented with vigor and without leniency, so employees dare not test the law, resulting in a significant improvement in conduct. Recently, it was discovered that employees in the purser's department and cargo handling department of a certain ship were privately carrying copper coins. The bureau, upon instruction from the Ministry of Transportation to strictly investigate, immediately dismissed the personnel involved in carrying private goods, as well as relieving the purser, Mr. Guo, and the cargo handling director, Mr. Xu, of their duties. Furthermore, the Ministry of Transportation discovered that a certain Captain Zhang and Chief Engineer Feng of a certain ship were engaging in high-interest lending, recklessly exploiting others, and falsifying service records to fraudulently obtain certifications. The ministry immediately ordered the China Merchants Bureau to dismiss these individuals and never rehire them. At the same time, the Shanghai Maritime Bureau was instructed to revoke all certifications obtained by these individuals. The severity of the measures demonstrates the commitment. It is also reported that the bureau attaches great importance to rectifying employee conduct. At the same time, it has also instructed employees to serve diligently and avoid such behavior, lest they bring trouble upon themselves.</p>

<h3>Land Ownership Certificates for Beiqiao and Dashu Townships</h3>
<p>Shanghai County Land Administration Bureau Issues Public Notice Urging Collection</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Land Administration Bureau, since the beginning of this year, has been processing and issuing land ownership certificates. The work has been extraordinarily intense. Certificates have already been issued for the four townships of Beiqiao, Dashu, Zhong'an, and Yuqi in the first district. It is now learned that the bureau has set May 1st as the date to begin issuing certificates for the two townships of Zizhu and Sangang. The deadline for issuing certificates remains two months. A public notice was issued yesterday urging all property owners to bring their registration documents to the bureau within the prescribed time limit to claim their certificates and secure their property rights. The deadline for collecting custody fees for the ownership certificates for Beiqiao and Dashu townships expires on June 1st. After that date, the registration will be revoked. In order to ensure the security of property rights, the bureau, in addition to notifying each household, issues another public notice as a serious warning. The original text is as follows: "It has been found that the land ownership certificates for Beiqiao and Dashu townships in the third district began to be issued on January 2nd of this year. The deadline for issuing certificates was set for two months. Custody fees are collected after the deadline. If the certificates are not claimed after three months of collecting custody fees, the registration will be revoked. The land will be temporarily managed by this bureau. A public notice has already been issued. It has been found that a small number of property owners in the two townships have delayed claiming their land ownership certificates. The deadline for collecting custody fees will expire on June 1st. If the certificates are not claimed within this deadline, their registration will be revoked according to the regulations, and their land will be temporarily managed. This matter concerns the gains and losses of the people's property. In addition to copying and issuing notices urging the collection of certificates to the township offices for distribution and urging each household, it is imperative to issue a public notice urging property owners who have delayed claiming their certificates to come to the bureau within the prescribed time limit to claim their certificates and secure their property rights. Do not delay and cause harm."</p>
<h3>Reorganizing Aircraft Donations</h3>
<p>Aircraft Donations Should Be Transferred on a Case-by-Case Basis During Changes of Personnel in Various Departments</p>
<p>The General Association of the China Aviation Construction Association has reported that whenever there is a change of personnel in various national departments, there are often cases of outstanding payments of aircraft donations. The outgoing official is deemed exempt because he has left office, while the incoming official claims that the matter was handled by the previous official and shirks responsibility. Such a situation has a significant impact on donation affairs. Therefore, a request was submitted to the Executive Yuan to issue a circular to all national departments stating that whenever there is a change of personnel, all aircraft donations that have been collected but not remitted, or that have been remitted but not cleared, must be transferred on a case-by-case basis and not overlooked. When the incoming official takes over, he must be responsible for thoroughly checking and clearing the aircraft donations handled by the previous official, or for recovering them. If there is any concealment or failure to report, it should be reported to the supervisor for verification and handling, and no cover-ups should be allowed, in order to protect public funds and benefit donation affairs. The request has been approved and forwarded to the National Government to issue a circular to all subordinate departments for compliance.</p>
<h3>Aviation Construction Association Distributes Longevity Commemorative Medals</h3>
<p>Recipients Number 141</p>
<p>Last year, on the occasion of Chairman Jiang's 50th birthday, people at home and abroad enthusiastically raised large sums of money to purchase aircraft as birthday gifts. This spirit of enthusiasm for national defense and love for the leader was unprecedented in history. In addition to requesting the Executive Yuan to reward the donors, the members of the Aircraft Donation Commemorative Meeting were also requested to be awarded medals by the Executive Yuan as a permanent commemoration. The recipients numbered 141. The medals have been sent out in batches by the General Association of the China Aviation Construction Association.</p>
<h3>Hua Yang Charity Reports on the Perilous Conditions of Disaster Relief Distribution</h3>
<p>The Hua Yang Charity, located at 97 Renji Road, is deeply concerned about the increasing number of starving disaster victims in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, who urgently need rescue. It has joined forces with the China Jisheng Society to dispatch a large number of relief workers to the disaster area to provide aid in various locations, in order to quickly rescue the victims and prevent further deaths. However, the county is infested with bandits, making relief distribution extremely difficult. Fortunately, the relief workers, disregarding their own lives and hardships, have been able to actively carry out their work. We have received reports from Feng Yangshan, the director of the relief distribution, outlining the difficulties and dangers they face. Details are provided below. According to reports from the tenth relief team, including relief workers Mai Jinsheng and Fan Shoumin, the team is operating in high mountains and rugged stone roads. The disaster victims are extremely scattered, requiring them to climb over a mountain to reach just three or four households, holding onto vines and climbing on rocks. This is not only exhausting but also extremely dangerous, unprecedented in the history of relief efforts. However, considering the dire situation of the disaster victims waiting to be rescued, they dare not be afraid of danger. However, the number of disaster victims is large, making it difficult to distribute the relief funds adequately. They urgently hope for an increase in funds. According to a report from Feng Youmei of the fourth relief team, everywhere they go, they see disaster victims with emaciated faces. They are eating stone bran and elm bark to survive. It is truly heartbreaking. All along the way, they hear cries of sorrow echoing through the fields. It is unbearable to hear. Many disaster victims are suffering from abdominal distension. Many people who fled the famine are returning, and more aid may be needed. According to a report from Yu Jiashen of the thirteenth relief team, the area they are investigating is known for its barrenness, high mountains, and very little water. Since the great drought last year, nine out of ten households are empty. The situation is dire, with people selling their sons and daughters in increasing numbers. The number of people fleeing the famine is also increasing daily. When they hear that relief workers are coming, most people rush back. Most of the households they investigate are eating elm bark and stone powder to survive. The suffering is indescribable. Fortunately, there was rain and thunder yesterday, and the wheat seedlings may have hope. However, the roads are slippery and muddy, making the investigation even more difficult. It is also reported that, according to a letter from Director Feng, the number of disaster victims previously estimated was about 60,000. However, according to the households investigated by the various relief teams, the number exceeds one-third, totaling over 80,000. The original relief funds are difficult to allocate, causing great anxiety. It is hoped that all sectors of society will generously donate to provide universal relief.</p>
<h3>Kawagoe Holds Meeting with Staff Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Mistress Who Abused Maid Arrested and Sent to Court</h3>
<p>Wang Xisheng, a local resident in his sixties with modest assets, residing at No. 3 at the end of Lane 60, next to the Shunchang pawnshop at Yangwei Bridge, Lafayette Road in the French Concession, had a mistress, a woman from Suzhou. Three years ago, she spent 80 yuan in a village in Chongming to buy a ten-year-old girl as a maid, named Donglan. Unexpectedly, the woman was naturally violent. Any slight displeasure would be followed by whipping, causing the girl's body to be covered with injuries. The night before last, due to a trivial matter, the girl was beaten with a mop handle until she nearly fainted. Unable to bear the abuse any longer, Donglan was sent out yesterday afternoon and took the opportunity to run to the constable and report. She was taken to the French police station. The girl's original introducer was summoned, and the Suzhou woman was arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court. After an initial interrogation, she was released on bail pending further investigation.</p>

It is learned that Chief Detective Liu Huai of the Detective Brigade instructed the third team leader Shan Bin to dispatch many detectives, together with police officers from the police station in charge, to surround and arrest them at the house at about 10:00 p.m. the night before last. Ma Guiying and Gao Zhiyue were arrested on the spot. Later, they confessed that Chen, who was related to them, lived at No. 2, Lane 677. Therefore, at about 2:00 a.m. yesterday morning, they took the criminals to identify him. Chen was not at home, but Sheng Wenyuan, Xing Diankui, Su Futang, and others were arrested. Later, ten rifle bullets and a one-yuan central counterfeit bill were found in the house. They were taken to the brigade for interrogation.

<h3>Young Woman Jin Jingfang Sues Zhuang Dingxuan for Abandonment</h3>
<p>Case Ruled to Be Under Incorrect Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Zhuang Dingxuan, a compradore of Yichang Foreign Firm at No. 1 Sichuan Road and a local resident, residing at No. 709 Gordon Road, was recently sued by Jin Jingfang, a young woman from Ningbo (23 years old), residing at No. 5, Lane 14, Xiaoshadu Road, through lawyer Lu Dingkui, in the First Special District Court for criminal charges of obstructing social customs. The gist of her accusation was that the plaintiff met the defendant through a friend and began living together in September of the 24th year at No. 8 Renhuali, Sapo Sai Road. Later, they moved to No. 66 Pushi Road. At that time, Zhuang stated that he would marry the plaintiff as his wife. To reassure the plaintiff, he wrote a note on March 26th of the 25th year, stating that if he broke the agreement in the future, he would pay one thousand yuan. Now, the defendant has abandoned the plaintiff, so she filed a lawsuit, requesting that he be punished according to Article 229 of the Criminal Code, and demanded the payment of one thousand yuan as ancillary civil action. The case was heard by Judge Zhong Qing yesterday. Zhuang Dingxuan also hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to appear in court to defend him. He did not deny living with the plaintiff. After questioning by Judge Zhong, it was ruled that the crime occurred in the French Concession, so it should be under the jurisdiction of the Second Special District Court. The case was ruled to be under incorrect jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Congratulations to Qu Jinshan's Plaque, Where Did Chairman Lin's Seal Come From?</h3>
<p>Mutual Blame Leads to Nowhere, Further Investigation and Interrogation Allowed</p>
<p>Qu Jinshan, a Jiangbei tycoon in the Rihui Port of Nanshi, was sued for murder. After being acquitted by the High Court, his fellow villagers presented him with a plaque with the inscription "Character of Pure Excellence" as a congratulation. Unexpectedly, below the inscription "Presented by the Yancheng Shanghai Native Association", there was a signature stating "Written by Chairman Lin" and the seal of the Central Chairman. Xue Zhao, the former plaintiff, sued Qu and Cao Dawu, who delivered the plaque, to the District Court. Prosecutor Lei charged them with forging documents. Yesterday, Judge Wu opened the court. Qu Jinshan did not appear due to illness and appointed lawyer Xue Lisheng to represent him. Cao Dawu claimed that it was a mistake made by the lacquerer. Chen Changji (also known as Chen Changqing), the owner of the lacquer shop, testified that he was 60 years old and from Songjiang. Cao Dawu and others came to his shop in April last year to order a plaque, costing 21 yuan. He denied adding Chairman Lin's name and seal. As for the plaque in Chen Dacheng's shop, it was brought from Fujian by him and only had a shell made. At this point, Cao said that the district price was 46 yuan, and including the alcohol, it was 50 yuan. He added Chairman Lin's seal. The court ordered a change of date for investigation and further interrogation.</p>

<h3>Mental Illness Outbreak, Woman Hugs Tree and Shouts for Immortal Hu</h3>
<p>Ignorant Men and Women All Worship, Police Remove Tree</p>
<p>Zhang, an old woman from Chongming, recently suffered a mental breakdown, let her hair down, ran to a large tree on the south side of the former site of the Jisi Fei'er Road Xinchang Silk Factory, suddenly hugged the tree, and shouted "Immortal Hu!" As more and more people gathered, she told the crowd that the immortal resided in the tree. As a result, hundreds of ignorant men and women gathered and burned incense to worship under the tree. The local Caojiadu Police Station, fearing disturbances, sent a large number of detectives to drive away all the incense burners. However, after the news spread, hundreds of people went to pray every day. There were often women with mental illnesses sleeping under the tree and shouting for Immortal Hu. The local police station, believing that such rumors were confusing the public, sent police to drive them away, but they kept returning and would not leave all day. Yesterday, the Caojiadu Police Station, in order to fundamentally eliminate the problem, sent police to contact the landlord to quickly cut down the tree in order to eliminate the root of the trouble.</p>
<h3>Accusation of Throwing Bricks and Shooting Gun Due to Debt Dispute</h3>
<p>Suspected to Be the Work of Zhu Baixiang, Prosecutor Jiang Investigates</p>
<p>Zhu Baixiang, a local resident who runs the Yuanfengshun Silk Factory at No. 1 Yongchangli, Zhongxing Road, owed Xu Yulun, a local resident residing at No. 55 Tanjiacai, Jiaotong Road, 5,000 yuan in national currency for a long time and did not repay it. Xu sued him in the District Court and obtained a judgment for execution. The Yuanfengshun real estate was sealed up three times for auction. This resulted in animosity. After a court hearing on the 19th of this month, at 8:20 p.m., Xu's house was first hit by a large brick, followed by a shot that broke the glass window. The police were immediately called to investigate. A neighbor, Wang Jiali, testified that he saw Zhu Baixiang and a large man standing in the dark. He had talked to them, but because he knew them, he did not want to interfere. Xu Yulun stated that his fence had been set on fire on the night of April 3rd, but it was extinguished by neighbors. On April 5th, he was instigated by hooligans to be beaten. On that day, he was still in court, and Zhu was not present, but many hooligans were waiting in front of the court, intending to harm him. After reporting to the judge, he hired a car through his agent, lawyer Zhou Yu, and escaped from the back door of the court. That evening, there was a shot and a brick thrown into the house, so he believed it was clearly Zhu's work. Furthermore, Zhu was sentenced to two months in prison and given a three-year reprieve on December 2nd of the 24th year for false accusation. He is still on probation and continues to commit illegal acts. Therefore, he presented the newspaper regarding the reprieve and requested the police to arrest Zhu and send him to the District Court. After investigation by Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang, the defendant was temporarily released on bail by Hongchang Silk Factory. Yesterday, Prosecutor Jiang personally inspected the situation at Xu's house for the sake of litigation.</p>

<h3>Shack Dwellers Petition Against Municipal Council's Deadline to Dismantle Sheds</h3>
<p>All Sectors Pay Close Attention to This Matter; Hope the Council Does Not Act Too Radically</p>
<p>The 35,600-plus shack dwellers in the International Settlement, due to the Municipal Council's notice requiring all grass sheds within the Settlement to be completely dismantled before May 1, will inevitably have nowhere to live. They have sent representatives Tang Anping and others to petition organizations such as the First Special District Citizens' Federation and the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement, requesting them to negotiate with the Municipal Council to postpone the demolition until affordable housing is built to provide accommodation. Although the Citizens' Federation and the Ratepayers' Association have forwarded letters to the Municipal Council for negotiation, the Council has not given a clear answer. It is reported that the Council seems to be determined to demolish the grass sheds and is preparing everything, intending to first demolish the grass sheds in the Yangtszepoo area in the coming days. The shack dwellers are extremely panic-stricken upon hearing the news and petitioned the Ratepayers' Association again the day before yesterday, requesting them to stop it. At the same time, they decided that if the Council insists on its own way and refuses to listen, they will all gather together and wait quietly to be trampled upon, preferring to suffer disaster together rather than see anyone's grass shed being demolished. Therefore, the situation is quite serious. All sectors are paying close attention to this matter and hope that the Municipal Council does not act too radically to avoid causing trouble.</p>
<h3>Children's World Opens Today</h3>

<h3>Li Guojie Claims to Have No Assets in Case of Recovering Funds from China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Yesterday</h3>
<p>Siming Bank Stock Issue; Court Instructs Plaintiff to Pay Attention to Investigation</p>
<p>The case of Li Guojie, former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, embezzling public funds of more than 1.2 million yuan, was heard by Judge Wang Fengqiu of the Execution Division of the District Court in the Fourth Tribunal at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon. First, Jiang Hechun, the lawyer representing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stated that Li Guojie mortgaged 50,000 yuan of Anhui Changhua Iron Mine stocks to Siming Bank for 30,000 yuan on November 25, 1935. How could he mortgage it after the incident had already occurred? Therefore, a request has been submitted to the Ministry of Communications, asking Siming Bank to hand over the stocks for execution. At this point, Lu Shifang, the lawyer representing the defendant, stated that the mortgage was in 1931, and since the bank must renew it every six months, it has been extended to this day. However, he agreed to the execution of the remaining 20,000 yuan of stocks. At this point, Shi Naixiu, the lawyer representing Siming Bank, stated that the bank has priority over the stocks and cannot be executed. The judge said to Mr. Shi that last time your lawyer submitted a statement agreeing to hand over the case within five days. Statements made in court are to be held accountable. Now you suddenly oppose it and raise the claim of execution appeal, which is unreasonable. Mr. Shi said that a lawsuit for confirmation has now been filed separately. At this point, lawyer Jiang Hechun said that Li Guojie has not handed over any assets since June 6 of last year, which is obviously wrong. The defendant should be ordered to hand them over within a time limit. Li Guojie said that I really have no assets. If the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company investigates and finds my assets, they can be executed at any time. The court instructed to change the date for investigation and further questioning and instructed the plaintiff to also pay attention to the investigation.</p>
<h3>Fish Market Submits Request for Protection of Fry Purchase</h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce submitted a report to the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, stating that the cultivation of fish fry is crucial to the production of river fish. Now, during the spring fish spawning season, it is appropriate to cultivate fish fry. The market, in view of this, plans to send personnel from the river fish wholesale to fish fry producing areas such as Jiangsu to purchase and transport them to Shanghai to increase production. Fry loading is not comparable to ordinary goods. Not only do they suffer extortion from hooligans along the port, which suddenly increases costs, but they also need to take fresh water for nutrition and care, which are both difficult. The transportation costs are also higher than other goods. From the place of production to the destination, several hundred yuan of miscellaneous expenses must be added. Without improvement, how can it be maintained? Therefore, it is proposed to separately request the relevant government offices to provide convenience to maintain the industry and increase production. It is appropriate to submit a report to your government, requesting you to order all counties along the river to provide protection and convenience to those purchasing fish fry passing through the border to maintain the fishery and emphasize production. It is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Limits Usage of Steam Whistles for Pu River Ferries</h3>
<p>Due to frequent tragedies involving towboats in the Pu River, the harbor master of Jianghai Customs, Tebeck, has issued a notice limiting the usage of steam whistles on towboats to reduce the risk of collisions. The original letter is as follows: According to Article 12 of the Port Management Vessel Regulations and Article 28 of the Navigation Collision Avoidance Regulations, the horn sounds to be used by all towboats and small ferries within the harbor waterway of this port are limited to one short blast, two short blasts, and three short blasts, respectively indicating that the ship has now changed course to turn right, change course to turn left, and reverse quickly, so that the other ship coming can be aware and pay attention. There are no other signal regulations besides these. However, recently, the captains of the above-mentioned vessels within this port often drag out the short blast, which has become a habit. Even more extreme errors occur when they release these signals, not knowing that according to the regulations, it indicates that the ship is shifting direction. Their intention is to indicate the movement of the oncoming ship, which causes misunderstandings and leads to deviations. Incidents of two ships colliding with each other are frequent. Furthermore, the captains of ships in this port have a habit of releasing the horn again after receiving the reported sound of the oncoming ship to indicate a reply. In order to maintain navigation safety and the interests of each ship, all of the above-mentioned habits should be eliminated. The original regulations are hereby further clarified in three items as follows: ① Ships are only allowed to use one short blast, two short blasts, and three short blasts within this port. ② This signal is used to indicate that the ship releasing it has now shifted its direction, and it is not intended to indicate any action by the oncoming ship. ③ After receiving the returning horn sound from the oncoming ship, there is no need to release a horn in response. This letter is sent for your review, and you must explain the above points in detail to each captain and urge them to strictly abide by them to avoid repeating past mistakes.</p>

<h3>Report by Commander of British Forces in Shanghai Inspecting the Volunteers</h3>
<p>Major General De Forest-Molett, commander of the British forces in Shanghai, submitted a report to Mr. Fessenden, chairman of the Municipal Council, after inspecting the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, stating that since the commander took office in August of last year, he had observed the evening drills of various units of the corps and was deeply satisfied with their achievements. The last time a large group of corps members held a mobilization exercise, communicating with the Russian team and Municipal Council police officers, the results were excellent. In the past few months, reserve members of the Russian team have assisted police officers several times, acting quickly and reliably. On April 10 of this year, all members held their annual drill, and their assembly and drills reached the highest level. This commander believes that the Volunteer Corps is well-suited to take action during an emergency, such as a real mobilization. After receiving the report, Mr. Fessenden sent a letter of thanks.</p>
<h3>Qian Yulin, Lu Quansheng, and Others Arrested for Forging Yellow River Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>Finance Office of Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission Sent Personnel to Shanghai to Accuse; Qian Confessed to Selling Forged Tickets for Food Due to Unemployment</p>
<p>The Finance Office of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission in Beiping, after the Yellow River flood, reported to the superiors and was approved to issue Yellow River Flood Relief Lottery Tickets, which were wholesaled by the manager of the Beiping Municipal Bank. Twenty-five issues have been issued to date, with monthly draws. Last month, counterfeit 24th issue winning lottery tickets were discovered on the market and presented for prize money. After a thorough investigation, it was learned that the agency issuing the counterfeit tickets was located at 94 Limei Road in the French Concession of Shanghai. The manager of the Beiping Municipal Bank reported this to the Finance Office of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission, which in turn submitted it to the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission and sent a letter, sending Xu Xingru (32 years old, from Anhui), a staff member of the Finance Office, to Shanghai to contact Director Li of the Shanghai Office of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission in the Xiahui Fang on Avenue Joffre. The day before yesterday, based on intelligence, he reported to the French Concession police and requested the arrest of the counterfeiters. Inspector Qian Chenglong, along with detectives Jiang Shangwen, Wang Rusong, Xu Daorong, Ma Yizhi, Wang Guanlin, and Jin Bingwen, rushed to the office of the Great China Record Company Mail Order Department at 94 Limei Road at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, arrested the owner Qian Yulin (36 years old, from Changshu), and copied the correspondence books and other items for purchasing lottery tickets by mail. They were taken to the police station. Qian admitted to selling the counterfeit lottery tickets and confessed that Lu Quansheng (39 years old, from Baoshan), who lived at 162 Dongzilaihuo Street, printed them. The detectives continued to arrest Lu. He confessed that he had printed the counterfeit tickets and that the printing plate was hidden at the home of Cheng Buyun at 118 Shaonian Road in the Chinese district. The detectives took Lu and went to Cheng's home with police detectives from the Municipal Police Bureau and seized five large lead plates and six small lead plates for privately printing counterfeit Yellow River Flood Relief Lottery Tickets, two bags of lead type, and six seals. The evidence is temporarily stored in the Municipal Police Bureau pending the filing of a document for transfer. At the same time, the detectives arrested Lu's younger brother, Lu Quande, and brought him back to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Sun Pengxian questioned them. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case, saying that the defendants are being detained and investigated for using counterfeit securities and requested a postponement until the investigation is completed and a lawsuit is filed. The detectives reported on the arrest of the defendants. Xu Xingru, the representative of the Finance Office of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission, stated that after discovering the counterfeit tickets, he investigated and came to Shanghai to report the arrest to the police. Qian Yulin confessed that he originally ran a cigarette paper store but was unemployed and had no choice but to sell counterfeit tickets for food. Lu Quansheng confessed that Qian Yulin gave him a sample on the first of this month and asked him to print 1,000 copies for 70 yuan. It was only this one time. Lu Quande confessed that he had just come to Shanghai with his sister from the countryside yesterday and did not know about the printing of counterfeit tickets. After verifying the confessions in court, the judge ordered a postponement for further questioning at 9:00 AM on the 30th. The defendants were detained.</p>
<h3>Spanish Civil War Affects Overseas Chinese Returning Home to Seek Refuge</h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai on the Querrapoo Wheel; Another Group of Refugees Expelled from Japan</p>
<p>Our overseas Chinese in Spain, Xia Guoqing and others, returned home to seek refuge due to the ongoing civil war in Spain. Furthermore, Hu Heling and others, overseas Chinese in Japan, were recently expelled by the Japanese police authorities and returned home. The reporter from Datong News Agency provides the following details:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Spain</p>
<p>Our overseas Chinese compatriots in Spain, Xia Guoqing (43 years old), Wu Zhongxing (37 years old), and Dong Chengru (32 years old), were doing business in the Spanish city. Since the outbreak of civil war in the country, they could not operate. They went to the Netherlands and then to Paris to seek refuge, requesting the Chinese Consulate in France to provide financial assistance. They arrived in Shanghai on the French mail ship Querrapoo the day before yesterday. Upon hearing the news, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of this city sent personnel to the pier to take care of them. Yesterday, they purchased tickets from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on their behalf and sent them back to their hometown of Qingtian, Zhejiang Province, on the Haiyan Wheel.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Japan</p>
<p>Hu Heling (33 years old), from Ruian, Zhejiang, had lived in Nagasaki, Japan, for 12 years. Wu Anyin (55 years old), from Ruian, Zhejiang, had lived in Japan for 14 years. Hu and others were all peddlers. Recently, they were expelled by the Japanese police authorities. Yesterday, they arrived in Shanghai on the Aso Maru. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau sent personnel to receive them, contacted the Shen'an Public Bureau on their behalf, and sent them back to Wenzhou via the Sanjiang Wheel for transfer to their hometown.</p>
<h3>Women's Movement League to Recruit Members</h3>
<p>The Chinese Women's Movement League held its first membership meeting of the year at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road last night. Thirty people, including Ms. Fang Jida, Lin Pengxia, Jiang Ying, Zhu Baoliang, and Zhang Heng, attended. After the meal, Wang Xiaoying was elected as chairman to begin the report and discussion items as follows: ① Liu Wang Liming reported that the association, formerly known as the Chinese Women's Suffrage Association, was established for more than seventeen years and has worked hard for equality between men and women in law and for national liberation. It has a glorious and brilliant history. In recent years, because women have already obtained legal equality, the members' meeting decided to expand the scope of the association's affairs, reorganize the Chinese Women's Movement League, and establish five departments: law, education, agriculture, industry, and family, to engage in practical work and fulfill the duties of citizens. ② Jiang Ying proposed that leading figures in the women's community should be invited to join as members. The association should expand its organization, openly recruit, and invite those present to be recruitment members for a period of two weeks, from the 27th of this month to the 10th of May. ③ The articles of association will be revised, and Wang Xiaoying and Wang Ruizhu will be responsible. ④ The location of the second meeting will be at the residence of Ms. Chen Zemin. ⑤ A new members' reception will be held on May 15, convened by Liu Wang Liming. In addition, many other proposals were passed. Finally, the chairman introduced Ms. Lin Pengxia to give a speech on her trip to the Northwest and her plans to sail to Singapore, India, and Xinjiang, which was earnest and touched the audience. The meeting ended at around 10:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Sato Emphasizes Expanding Economic Activities</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Tokyo telegram reported that, regarding the issue of Japanese control over economic activities in China, although all parties in China hope to prioritize the resolution of political issues, financial capital and other sectors here do not seem to feel discouraged as a result. On the contrary, they hold an optimistic attitude, firmly believing that it is only necessary to follow the path of success achieved by Japan in its economic development in China in the past year or two, and that there is no need to work hard on political issues. Indeed, there are many ways to destroy a country, and there are also many ways for a country to bring about its own demise. Divided hearts, political corruption, following old ways in foreign affairs, frequent internal wars, and the willingness of traitors and puppets to be exploited by others—none of these is not a way to bring about self-destruction.</p>
<p>As for methods of destroying another country, it is either through forceful military occupation or through economic aggression, or by using traitors and puppets to first divide it. However, the use of traitors and puppets for division must also be backed by military force, as exemplified by the Spanish Civil War. Economic aggression, on the surface, seems more peaceful, but its effectiveness in destroying a country is no less than military force. One should not say that because others do not take drastic measures but use gradual and progressive methods, they have genuine sincerity for friendship.</p>
<p>Currently, the diplomatic authorities of both China and Japan are saying that they will adhere to the principle of equality and mutual benefit. This sounds plausible, but one wonders what the definition of so-called equality and mutual benefit is. For example, if A has something and B wants to seize it for themselves, A naturally refuses to give it. B then says, "Let's 'hahū' (a pidgin term implying shared benefits), let's divide it equally, so that you won't suffer a loss, and I certainly won't take advantage." This is also a form of equality and mutual benefit. Now, there are talks of joint ventures regarding certain railways, and proposals for cooperation regarding certain minerals. Many of our country's profitable undertakings are desired to be split evenly, with each side taking half, and they still proclaim to others, "This is equality and mutual benefit." Who would believe that?</p>
<p>Assuming joint ventures with foreigners, whether or not our sovereignty can be controlled by us is already a question. In the event of war, the other party could use the pretext of protecting mineral resources or railway lines to freely advance troops and station troops, while we would have no way to resist. Therefore, our insistence on resolving political issues as a prerequisite is indeed correct. If political issues are not resolved, we are unwilling to discuss any economic issues, and there is a reason for this. However, what needs to be done now, what needs to be clearly recognized, is that the land of North China is all our country's land, and the officials of North China are all officials appointed by our central government. Therefore, all political activities in North China must be carried out in accordance with the central government, and all kinds of illegal organizations and illegal agreements will never be recognized by the central government, nor will they be recognized by our people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the telegram says that although all parties in China hope to resolve political issues as a prerequisite, the Japanese side is not pessimistic and only needs to follow the path of success achieved by Japan in its economic development in China in the past year or two, without the need to work hard on political issues. What important meaning does this statement have? What was the situation of Japanese development in North China in the past year or two? If we do not give it deep consideration and make adequate preparations, the consequences will be unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Dissection</h3>
<p>— Ya Min</p>
<p>I have grown accustomed to corpses lying horizontally, and the smell of preservatives is also familiar to me. I no longer shed tears from the stimulation of the mixed scent of alcohol and "naphthalein," nor do I feel dizzy from prolonged stays in front of the corpse bed.</p>
<p>After two years of life in the dissection room, I now have a dull sense of smell and dull emotions. Guarding naked corpses is like guarding plaster human models; I feel no sadness or fear. Because as a medical student, my mind is filled with Latin terms and a purely material view of things; I lack the emotions of poets and children.</p>
<p>Dead organisms are viewed by medical scholars in the same way as inanimate objects. Therefore, a stiff corpse, the washbasin in the anatomy hall, and the dissection bed are all the same to me. We chat and laugh across corpses, and sometimes even cut off a piece of human flesh and send it to a companion: "Old Wang, have a piece of pork chop." We say such facetious things. We also turn off the lights in the anatomy room at night, and several of us guard the large jar of bones, reaching into the cold liquid to pull out a wet bone, and guess the name of each part of the bone, gambling for wine and food based on this.</p>
<p>Thus, the most ruthless doctors, educated by the most cruel methods, go out into society one by one, performing what the world calls the most benevolent career.</p>
<p>Tonight, because I was rushing to complete the dissection of the muscles on a thigh, when the university bell tower struck twelve, I was still lingering under the dazzling lights of the dissection room, and the silver scalpel was gliding over my pale gray, stiff muscles.</p>
<p>In the room there were me, over twenty complete corpses, and in the corpse pits there were some partially dissected limbs. In one corpse pit, many children's corpses were pickled in alcohol, and in another corpse pit there were many ugly heads, many bones, and many internal organs. This scene is quite terrifying to think about.</p>
<p>But I sat peacefully in the pile of dead people, pouring my heart into my work: only the sound of my breathing filled the spacious dissection room.</p>
<p>I was already skilled in the use of scalpels and dissecting knives.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>It was not the first time I had lingered in this room until late at night, but today I had a strange feeling, and the scalpel felt unusually dull in my hand. I often recklessly damaged the textures of a nerve or destroyed the structure of a muscle bundle. Even the flesh-like, withered corpse in my hands, which was usually easy to peel away, became stubbornly tough tonight.</p>
<p>Astonished by my own feelings, I pondered repeatedly, and finally noticed the corpse I was dissecting.</p>
<p>It was a female corpse, and judging by the development of her bones and teeth, she must have been of an age to be charming when she was alive.</p>
<p>On her haggard corpse, I used the brush of imagination to depict her former glory.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was pure in life. Cherishing her own beauty, and cherishing her own love, not easily allowing a reckless young man to approach her, thus having the cold arrogance of a holy virgin. Or perhaps she was a glamorous girl, and frivolous young men wasted excessive enthusiasm or money, hoping to get half an hour of warmth by her side.</p>
<p>But here, she openly reveals her body in front of strangers without any cover, allowing frivolous fingers to caress her body, without shyness or refusal. This is something she never dreamed of in her lifetime.</p>
<p>Thus, a faint sadness crept into my heart, and I lowered my head, thinking of death, of what it would be like if I were lying here.</p>
<p>Even if I would not be used as a dissecting experiment like these unfortunate corpses, the tomb, with yellow earth plugging my mouth, allowing black snakes to nest in my heart, and earthworms to pass through my flesh and bones, would be even more unbearable then.</p>
<p>Gathering up my books and instruments, I hurriedly left the corpses and the room with my head lowered.</p>
<h3>Dog Meat</h3>
<p>— Tian She</p>
<p>The cool pavilion at the bridgehead was often occupied by oil mill workers chatting. Early in the morning, everyone brought their bowls of porridge and dishes of soy beans for a communal meal. Some sat proudly on the wooden railings of the pavilion, some squatted by the stone tablet, and some leaned against the wooden post for tethering cattle. The oil mill owner would scold them every time he saw them: "Uncivilized lot, you don't sit at the tables provided, always eating in the open like famine refugees." But the workers' habit could not be changed by scolding. As soon as the boss turned his back, they would grumble, "Sit at the tables? There's no fish or meat to eat, just soy beans and vegetable soup every day...sitting at the tables is just for show!" In fact, the greatest convenience for them in eating porridge and rice in the pavilion was that they could chat without restraint.</p>
<p>During their after-meal rest and when they finished washing their feet at the pier in the evening, except when it was windy or raining, they would gather three times a day, like big bosses discussing something, with each person saying a sentence or two. However, sometimes they would laugh and shout at the top of their lungs, without the solemnity and seriousness of a real meeting. In their three sentences, there were two about "eating." Everyone seemed to be suffering from a "eating" sickness. It was no wonder, as in the oil mill, they only got their fill of rice porridge, and the vegetable soup was very bitter. On the first and fifteenth of the lunar month, they had meat, but the pieces of braised pork were barely the size of dice. Each person was barely given two pieces, and the small amount of oil could not even moisten their stomachs. Therefore, Tu Gen, the crooked mouth, often proposed eating a large pot of meat, the fattier the better, stewed with dried mussels and wood ear mushrooms. Chang Jiao Shunfu was the first to agree, "Rice builds strength, meat builds muscle. Our muscle isn't good; everyone's getting as skinny as monkeys!" But there was an immediate response from Ah You at the oil press, who always spoke with some venom:</p>
<p>"Eat meat, eat meat, the pigs haven't even been reborn yet. We only hear the sound of the escalator but don't see anyone coming downstairs. You can't eat meat just by talking; does money materialize? How much do you two have in your wallets? Let's eat dog meat!" These words caused a burst of bitter laughter among everyone. Even Tu Gen, the crooked mouth, and Chang Jiao Shunfu laughed. When the crooked mouth laughed, it felt both comical and pitiful. The laughter attracted Old Huang, who poled bean boats, ashore. Because he had good muscles and bones, everyone called him Iron Bones. "Iron Bones, do you want to eat dog meat? Hehehe..." Ah You narrowed his eyes, pursed his lips, and leaned against the stone pillar of the pavilion.</p>
<p>"Dog meat? Can't get it." Old Huang patted the bean dust off his shoulders. His cloth shirt was unbuttoned, and the afternoon sun shone on his broad chest. He continued solemnly, "Dog meat isn't as bad as pork; it's all lean, more fragrant than rabbit meat, as fresh and clean as beef, without the sour taste of horse meat. Moreover, eating dog meat has benefits; it helps heal injuries. Whether it's a beating, a crush, a contusion, or a puncture wound, it's more effective than injury plasters. Where do those who sell dog skin plasters get so much dog skin! If you don't believe me, you can try it. I used to row a ferry in Jurong Road. I crashed into a bridge pier and had a labor injury for half a year. It was healed by eating three large bowls of dog meat." He patted his chest again, telling everyone to look, as if his current strong body was entirely due to dog meat.</p>
<p>Everyone listened with rapt attention, as if they were all tasting the flavor of dog meat, fragrant, fresh and clean, without a sour taste. Especially Tu Gen, the crooked mouth, was deeply attracted by the claim that dog meat could heal injuries. He often suffered from chronic injuries. During the day, he worked hard, shouldering soybeans when there were soybeans to carry, and filling in as a helper at the oil press when there was a shortage of people, moving bean cakes, and operating the stone mill... He didn't feel much during the day, but it was terrible when he went to bed at night. His bones ached all over, his hands and feet burned, and his back sweated profusely. When it rained, he would get sick all day long. Although the pier didn't require loading or unloading cargo, turning over the bean stalks was doubly strenuous. The boss never went out to the streets, and the oil cake customers didn't come to him to discuss business. He spent his days supervising the workers' work, not allowing them to slack off even if their backs hurt, a life of no rest, a life that was killing him.</p>
<p>So, he purchased dog meat every day and finally revealed the point, eating dog meat doesn't need money. It is easy to do. Ah You was the first one to call people to eat dog meat. You can't run away. Everyone must limit him to catch a dog tonight to nearby villages. Tu Gen the Crooked Mouth is assigned to be in charge of firewood. Skinning and burning the dog is solely handled by Iron Bones. Everyone who wants to drink is in charge of buying alcohol. Everyone showed joy on their faces. There's meat to eat tonight to moisten the dry intestines. Dog meat is not as bad as pork. It will be stewed in a big pot. The oil mill cook is willing to lend a large pot. The earth will be dugout at the foot of the bridge. Ah You also dreamed of the good taste of dog meat but he feared being bitten by the dog, or any accidental happening. Tu Gen's crooked mouth was also filled with anxiety, "Will dog meat really be able to heal my labor injuries? Is there really such an effective remedy under the sky?" The cool pavilion seemed to be filled with the fishy smell of fresh dog meat….</p>

<h3>Postscript</h3>
<p>Modern people, with their developed thirst for knowledge and the ever-improving transportation environment, travel in droves, making what the ancients called traveling ten thousand miles a lifelong ambition, truly incomparable to the past.</p>
<p>The joy of travel is universally understood, and its benefits to knowledge are that seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times. The resources acquired from books and the research of teachers and friends often resolve problems that lingered in the mind, with just a moment of personal observation bringing sudden realization. Gu Tinglin of the past wrote "The Book of Benefits and Harms of the World's Counties and Kingdoms," which spread throughout the land, and scholars know that it benefited from his personal investigation, serving as an example. As for its benefits to the body and mind, traveling with joy, holding a bamboo staff, can both strengthen physical fitness and broaden the mind. For spiritual cultivation, there is truly no better strategy. Sima Qian's literary brilliance, which amazes both the past and the present, was due to his travels through rivers and lands, which truly contributed to his accomplishments.</p>
<p>Since we fully recognize the benefits of travel, we should further promote the cause of travel, the progress of transportation and tools, the construction of the environment, and even the plans for guidance. We dare not lag behind others and are therefore testing its beginnings during this pleasant spring holiday. The compilation of this special travel issue, scheduled to be published in four installments, was undertaken with much effort and creation. We are grateful to the public and those directly and indirectly involved in the travel industry for their generous assistance, which has allowed us to fulfill our initial wishes. The results have even exceeded our planned expectations, which alone shows the increasing importance people place on travel. This is partly due to the public's continued support for this newspaper, and the staff of this newspaper will certainly work harder to further advance the effort in a reasonable period of time, in order to show a small token of our gratitude. With the compilation completed, we use these few words to express our gratitude and appreciation.</p>
<h3>A Visit to Lotus Cave</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiaokan</p>
<p>Guizhou, located in the frontier, is characterized by layers of overlapping hills and mountains, with peaks rising into the clouds, and is known as the "Mountain Kingdom." The abundance of caves is unmatched by other regions. The most famous of these is Yangming Cave in Longchangyi, but in reality, the cave itself is not particularly remarkable. However, due to the extraordinary contributions of the ancient sage Wang Yangming to the enlightenment of the entire culture of Guizhou Province, the place became famous because of the person. In terms of scenic beauty, Lotus Cave, located in Puding County of the province, should be the top choice. However, due to its remote mountainous location, mixed with Miao and Yi ethnic groups, and the closed-mindedness of the local people, even though there is an ancient cave of tranquility and extraordinary beauty, few outside the region know about it, and it is only used as a haven from Qin Dynasty-like turmoil during times of war. Alas, the obliteration of scenic spots is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to travel to Guizhou, and having long heard of the beauty of Lotus Cave in Puding, I took the opportunity to visit and explore it, so that I could truly understand the true face of Mount Lu. Upon arriving in Puding, I walked about ten miles north of the city, and saw only steep ridges and hills, overlapping and protruding, with lush pines and cypresses, and thorns covering my ankles, creating an image of "I cannot go, brother." So, I gathered my spirits, turned mountains and ridges, crossed pine ridges, passed through dense forests, and crossed winding streams, finally reaching my destination. A small path in the weeds was almost indistinguishable. Guided by the local people, I finally reached the cave. The cave entrance was dangerous and narrow, curved and slanting, allowing only one person to pass through. Single file, we entered, and saw a high skylight, suddenly opening up into a wide and bright space. We crossed the stone arch bridge and went down the stone steps, about seventy-seven steps in total. The ground was extremely flat and wide, with a height of sixty meters. The four walls were all stalactites, shaped like arhats, Guanyin, fierce beasts, flying birds, pointed pagodas, and dragon pillars. The shapes and colors were endless, and the eye could not take it all in. To the right was a stone room, exquisitely built, tranquil and secluded. To the left was a tunnel, deep and unfathomable, sometimes high, sometimes low, sometimes wide, sometimes narrow, winding to the fullest extent. Because of the darkness, it was necessary to light candles to proceed. At the end of the tunnel was another large cave, several times larger than the previous cave, with a height of two hundred meters. The ground sloped like a measure, with a difference in height of about fifty meters. At the high points, there were mounds of earth, with flowers and plants growing, and the fresh air was pleasant. At the lowest point, there was a subterranean stream flowing through, murmuring and gurgling, like the mutual striking of bells and drums. In the center of the cave, a stone spring dripped downwards, and at the point of dripping, there was a huge stone, large enough for four people to encircle, with edges around it capable of holding about five inches of water. We scooped it up and drank it, and it was clear and refreshing. There were also stone drums and stone bells, which rang when struck, and stone pagodas and stone dragons, which looked dignified. Inside the cave were dozens of smaller caves, some large, some small, some high, some low, some round, some square, some straight, some curved, some bright, some dark, some clear, some turbid, some accessible for exploration, and some only visible from a distance. On the walls of each cave, many Buddha statues were carved and painted with gold, with dazzling and shocking gold, silver, and ancient bronze colors, worthy of praise, and the exquisite artistry was especially precious. When leaving the cave, we encountered another stone room, which contained rubbings of calligraphy by famous figures from Chinese dynasties, as well as ink rubbings of Indian script, Greek Torcello script, valuable cultural relics, and many other antiques. I and others have a passion for ancient things and entered to browse, spending an hour of mental and visual effort. In summary, what we gained was like a drop in the ocean. After returning from the visit, I wrote this to record my experiences and urge the authorities of the province to pay attention and promptly conduct surveys and repairs, in order to protect the scenic spots.</p>

<h3>Travelogue of Beiping</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>Of the many places I have visited, none can compare to the beauty of Beiping, which is filled with the wonderful atmosphere of oriental tranquility.</p>
<p>Unlike the social life in metropolitan cities, where there are only cinemas and dance halls, in Beiping, one can spend a little money, take a rickshaw, and go along Chang'an Street to Zhongshan Park, where one can admire the red and green flowers and absorb the warm, fragrant, and fresh air.</p>
<p>East of Zhongshan Park is the Taimiao (Imperial Ancestral Temple). There, in addition to beautiful scenery, one can also see things used by the imperial priests of the Ming and Qing dynasties.</p>
<p>A few dozen steps east of the Taimiao is the Museum of Antiquities, which contains everything from pottery from the Shang and Zhou dynasties to stone tablets, weapons, and coins used by previous dynasties.</p>
<p>Across the street from the bustling Dong'an Market, passing through Xihua Gate, is the Hall of Three Greats, whose architecture is very magnificent. All the buildings are decorated with carvings and paintings, especially with soaring dragons and flying phoenixes, as if they were living creatures.</p>
<p>Not far away is the Forbidden City, whose architecture is even more magnificent. The palace also displays valuable antiques.</p>
<p>Jingshan (Prospect Hill), or Coal Hill, is near the Forbidden City. From this small hill, one can see the entire city, or the lake scenery of Beihai and Zhongnanhai.</p>
<p>A dozen steps further, and Beihai is in front of you. The White Pagoda of Beihai is reflected in the mirror-like lake. Sometimes, a gentle breeze blows, and there are also gentle white waves splashing. In the height of summer, red and white lotus flowers float in the lake, interspersed with a few small boats, which is truly indescribably beautiful, comparable to Hangzhou's West Lake.</p>
<p>In the south of the city, the famous scenic spots are the Temple of Heaven and the Altar of Agriculture. Here, in addition to displaying the excellence of Eastern architectural technology, one can also admire the lush, beautiful forests and the quiet surroundings. Anyone who has been to Beiping has visited these places.</p>
<p>There are even more scenic spots outside the city. A few miles outside Xizhimen, the winding and undulating West Hills come into view. Upon reaching Haidian, there are many magnificent palace-like buildings towering in front, standing majestically on the banks of the lake surrounded by weeping willows. This is Yenching University. The famous Summer Palace, or Longevity Hill, is located to the northwest of the school, forming a distant view.</p>
<p>From Qinglong Bridge, heading northwest, one can reach scenic spots such as Baozang Temple, Black Dragon Pool, Hot Springs, and Great Awakening Temple. Walking southwest, one can reach scenic spots and historical sites such as Jade Spring Hill, Reclining Buddha Temple, Azure Clouds Temple, Fragrant Hills, and Eight Great Sites. Especially Fragrant Hills, not only has beautiful scenery such as colorful flowers and mountains rising into the clouds, but also a refreshing climate, making it a good place for healing. Villas, hotels, and sanatoriums have been built all over the mountains, and tourists flock here in the summer, making it worthy of being called Beiping's Lushan.</p>

<h3>East Lake</h3>
<p>— Xiao Nan</p>
<p>The March sun was warm enough to make the withered peach and willow trees grow tender green leaves again. The soft branches of the weeping willows hung low by the water's edge, and the long leaves gently brushed the surface of the water, as if a long-haired young woman was arranging her morning makeup in front of a mirror. The bright red and pure white peach blossoms filled the branches, like a girl wearing a crown of flowers. Adorable little birds sang crisp and melodious songs of spring on the branches, as if telling people to enjoy life while they could.</p>
<p>Having already tired of Hangzhou, we were not very interested in it, so we thought of going to Shaoxing. We set off early in the morning after a hearty breakfast at the hotel. Because the Qiantang River Bridge was not yet completed, we had to cross the river at Jianggan. Usually, it's a free ferry, but cars had to pay a fare of one and a half dollars. We reached the Xiaoshao section of the highway, and the road surface was unexpectedly flat and wide. Having traveled all over the roads of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, this was the most satisfying.</p>
<p>As we passed Xiaoshan, the scenery became even more beautiful. On both sides were willows, growing like emerald canopies. The soon-to-be-ripe wheat bore fat ears. Golden rape flowers were interspersed with pink clover flowers and white bean flowers, forming a natural pattern. A river, neither wide nor narrow, had boats unique to the Shaoxing area, propelled by both hands and feet, coming and going on the river, and the ancient stone bridges further enhanced the beauty of the scenery.</p>
<p>The car drove very fast, and in less than an hour we reached Shaoxing. Turning left again, it was not long before we reached East Lake. The car stopped by the bridge and could not pass. We left the car and walked across the stone bridge. I was thinking that such a small place, without strange peaks or strange rocks, would surely disappoint us, but the reality was the opposite of my expectations. Walking into the gate, the houses were quite dilapidated, with walls eroded by wind and rain, and incomplete windows, clearly a discarded relic. Perhaps people are now slowly paying attention to it, so it is being repaired. The newly made windows are still white and have not been painted, and the walls and pillars have also been plastered very smoothly, but some are still covered with the ink treasures of unknown writers. Although it is so dilapidated, the scenery here made me cry out in admiration. The place is so secluded, like a paradise, with antique scenery that makes you feel like you are in another world. Opposite is a wall-like rock formed naturally. The small lake surface is as calm as a mirror. Winding creepers hang quietly over the water, and delicate wisteria, like bunches of grapes about to ripen, hang in clusters, emitting an intoxicating fragrance. Suddenly, a long, large fish leaped out, and a splash of water suddenly appeared on the still water, slowly growing larger and returning to calm. After watching for a long time, we hired two small boats and slowly rowed to the opposite rock face. The inside was just enough for a boat to pass through. On both sides are high cliffs.</p>

<p>, mountain spring water, drop by drop, falling into the water, the boat could no longer move forward, turned back and rowed across the small bridge, headed towards another rock, discovered a naturally formed cave, the boat passed through this cave and came out on the other side, we then abandoned the boat and went ashore, our stomachs were rumbling with hunger, but we were reluctant to leave this place, so we asked them to prepare some snacks, bought a few catties of aged wine, and comfortably enjoyed the scenery, canceling our planned trip to Lan亭 altogether, it was not until it was time to return that we started our journey back, but I still cannot forget this secluded paradise.</p>
<h3>Yandang Guide</h3>
<p>— Dao Rong</p>
<p>"Trying to describe the Dragon Pool is difficult, it's a waste to live without visiting Yandang", from these two lines of poetry, one can know just how good the scenery of Yandang is.</p>
<p>"Scattered, it is Yandang, gathered, it is Yellow Velvet, carved, it is the Mountain Gorge, one of China's four wonders", this is Wu Ya Lao's critique of Yandang after visiting it, establishing it as a nationally famous mountain. From these four criticisms, we say that Yandang is one of China's four major famous mountains, and this is not an overstatement.</p>
<p>"Spring travel to Tiantai, autumn travel to Yandang," this is commonly known among experienced travelers, because the strange peaks and rocks of Yandang are countless, and there is often fog in spring and summer, and the peaks and ridges are often blocked by white clouds, it is better to go in the autumn when the sky is clear, you can see clearly; it is said that there are horse leeches in Yandang, which sting people painfully, but they are gone in the autumn, so autumn travel to Yandang is the most suitable, in fact, horse leeches have long been extinct, not a problem, there is a lot of rain in spring and summer, hanging waterfalls and flying streams, Yandang is not unsuitable for spring. Because the beauty of Yandang lies in the majestic and strange peaks and ridges, but its ubiquitous flying waterfalls are indeed unmatched in other famous mountains in the country. Yongjia Commissioner Xu Pan Yun said "Yandang has a thousand waterfalls after a rain", so Yandang is not only known for its peaks, but also for its waterfalls, saying that Yandang is a mountain and water cave, this is not an empty word, so those who want to see mountains and water, those who want to see strange peaks and unique waterfalls, must visit Yandang, Member of the Central Committee Jing Hengyi came to Yandang for a visit the year before last and said, "Yandang in spring is better than Tiantai", this shows that Yandang is not only suitable for autumn travel, but also especially suitable for spring travel, now is a great season for spring travel, so I will talk about Yandang travel guide.</p>
<p>Yandang is named after a bird, located in Yueqing County, Wenzhou, eastern Zhejiang. In the Tang Dynasty, Arhat Nuojutuo was the founding ancestor. The Song Dynasty moved south, and tourism began to flourish. At that time, there were eighteen famous temples in the mountains, and the grandness can be imagined. The circumference is about 360 li, with 120 peaks, divided into six major areas: East Inner Valley, East Outer Valley, West Inner Valley, West Outer Valley, South Pavilion, and North Pavilion. The East Inner Valley has the most scenery, almost everywhere, as if entering the Shanyin Road, the eyes are overwhelmed. Yu Dafu said that the sedan carriers pointed out the sights all the way, making it difficult to remember, almost wanting to beg the sedan carriers to stop talking, which is true.</p>
<p>The beauty of Yandang's landscape does not need much publicity, it is already well known, but most tourists, although they have the interest, are hesitant because they are unfamiliar with the route and the situation in the mountains is unclear. It is said that many people arrive in Hangzhou and want to visit Yandang, but end up turning back halfway due to a lack of information, which is a pity. I am relatively familiar with the situation in Yandang, so I am very willing to tell the public what I know, and if it can help tourists in any way, I will be very happy.</p>
<p>To visit Yandang, you can go by both land and water. For water travel, you can take the Yili ship that departs from Shanghai's 16th Wharf every Thursday afternoon to Wenzhou, and you can cross the river to the mountain on Saturday morning, which is very convenient. The Yili ship is very clean; it is more comfortable than taking a car, or take the China Merchants' Haiyan ship to Wenzhou, the time can be shortened by one-third due to direct sailing, otherwise take a ship to Haimen in Linhai County, and then take a car to the mountain, which is also very convenient. In short, if you don't use your own car or chartered bus, it's more comfortable to take a ship than to take a public bus. There are two routes for land travel, one is to take a car from Hangzhou via Chuzhou and Wenzhou to Yandang, or to take a train from Hangzhou to Yiwu, then take a car to Chuzhou and Wenzhou, and then to Yandang, this is the western route. The other route is to go from Hangzhou to Taizhou and then to Yandang, this is the eastern route. If tourists have their own cars or rent a small chartered car, they can reach Yandang in one day from Hangzhou, but they have to cross the river four times in Hangzhou, Linhai, Huangyan. Pay attention to the tide in Linhai, otherwise you may have to wait three to five hours for the tide to rise, which tourists should pay special attention to, the other ferries are not a problem. If you come from the western route, you should also pay attention to the tide in Wenzhou and Qingjiang, and the ferry fee for private cars is one or two yuan each time, and if it is after 6 pm, the fee will be doubled. If tourists also want to visit Tiantai, it is best to stay in Tiantai for one or two days, so that there will be no difficult problems on the way. As for the road, the road surface has been repaired very well recently, and driving is not inconvenient, but the facilities at the stations along the way are simple, which is relatively inconvenient for female guests, but the Highway Bureau is currently trying to improve it, and it will soon be able to meet the hopes of travelers.</p>
<p>In addition to not knowing the route, tourists are also concerned about the safety on the way. In fact, there is no problem on the eastern route, so you can rest assured. The situation in the mountains is even more difficult for outsiders to understand. There are not only no thieves, but also no gambling, no hooligans, and no beggars, so Zhen Zhaoying said that Zhejiang has only Yandang, which is a clean land, really like a paradise, and the Management Committee's planting of peaches along the way seems to be creating a paradise as well.</p>
<p>After briefly introducing the route to the mountain and the situation in the mountains, I must also briefly talk about the food and lodging in the mountains. The current main entrance is Xianglingtou. After arriving at the destination, tourists can choose to stay in hotels or temples. There are currently two hotels. Yanshan Hotel is near the station. The rooms are relatively high and spacious, but the room rate is slightly higher, divided into two types, two yuan or one yuan per person. The food is divided into two corners and three corners per person. As for the Yandang Hotel, it is located at the entrance of Lingyan Temple. The highest room rate is eight corners per person, which is suitable for economical mountain climbers, but the sanitary facilities are relatively poor. If you stay in a temple, Lingyan Temple is the first choice, because the scenery of Yandang is concentrated in Lingyan, with peaks and waterfalls, which can be said to be a great achievement of mountains and rivers. The second is Lingfeng Temple, because it is newly built, followed by Jingming Temple, the house is not good, followed by Guanyin Cave, mostly inhabited by pilgrims, followed by Beidou Cave Baiyun Nunnery, etc., among which Lingyan Jingming, now have new sanitary equipment, unfortunately it has been destroyed by the immorality of tourists, now the flushing toilets are being reinstalled, and soon the Lingfeng Temple's porcelain bathtubs and flushing toilets can also be installed. In addition, Longhexuan in Dalongqiu, Yanyingshanfang in Xishiliang, and Lingxiaoguan in Sanshuiyan can all eat and stay, but at most only a dozen people can stay each night, so those who travel together must plan carefully after arriving at the mountain to avoid temporary difficulties.</p>
<p>After talking about the food and accommodation situation, of course, we must talk about the transportation tools in the mountains. In addition to sedan chairs, there are also rickshaws in the mountains, about thirty or so, when the car arrives, tourists can take them in order, because the rules here require you to follow the order, and you are not allowed to rob, just like the rickshaw drivers at the Xixing Wharf in Hangzhou, quite orderly. The sedan chairs are all made of rattan, and the style has been improved many times. First, it was the rickshaw style, but now it has been greatly improved and is quite practical. Chen Cheng and Zhang Daqian and others came to Yandang one after another and believed that there was no such good sedan chair in the famous mountains of the country. Ningbo Commissioner Xu Shida called the sedan chair a "wishful sedan chair" and a "universal sedan chair", and other general travelers also gave high praise.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must talk about the tour itinerary in the mountains. The tour methods can be divided into radial type and circumnavigation type. The radial type is to go out from the residence and return on the same day, the advantage is that the food and accommodation are more comfortable, but the disadvantage is that the tour time is more limited. The circumnavigation type is to stay anywhere and not return to the original residence. The advantage is that there is plenty of time to visit, and the disadvantage is that the food and accommodation are more difficult. The two programs each have their own advantages and disadvantages, which depends on each person's temperament to determine their direction. If you want to set a tour itinerary, then Jiang Shunan's list is very useful for reference, but the current situation is different. My idea is that if you visit for one day, you can visit Lingyan, Lingfeng, and Dalongqiu. On the second day, the first day, go to Sanshuiyan Longliu Xianshengmen Nange Zhenji Temple Lingfeng Chaoyang Cave and other places. On the second day, first go to Xishiliang and then see Meiyu Waterfall Luodai Waterfall Dalongqiu Yanzhi Waterfall Lingyan Temple Jingming Temple Three-fold Waterfall and other places. If you can visit for three days, then on the first day, go to Beige to see the great waterfall under Hanling and the Xianqiao Xianren Cave Beauty Jishifeng along the Xunling Road. On the second day, go to Nange all the way. On the third day, go to the Xiwai Valley all the way. In short, Lingyan Temple is the best place and should be put to the end, so that it is like watching the final show, which is more interesting, otherwise the farther you look, the more scattered it becomes; the interest in visiting the mountain will be reduced a lot. If you want to climb to a high place, you can go to Yanhu or Baigangjian, which is also good, but it is not easy to allow time.</p>
<p>People who climb mountains are always disappointed when it rains, but Yandang is not. Sunny days are good, but rainy days are also good, because the waterfall is large when it rains. It is also interesting to watch the waterfall instead of the peaks. Xiao Zheng came to visit Yandang and said, "It is interesting to see famous mountains in the rain," which is very reasonable. I often say that Yandang is not only suitable for autumn travel, but also suitable for travel in all seasons. Even snow travel, wind travel, fog travel, dawn travel, moonlit night travel, and even dark night travel have various wonderful things. The best time is between autumn and winter, after a heavy rain, on a moonlit night, the taste is even more endless.</p>
<p>Some people say that the strange and numerous peaks of Yandang may not be as good as Guilin, but that is not the case. Although Guilin has many strange peaks and rocks, it has no flying waterfalls and cliffs, so compared with Guilin, Yandang may be better. Ma Junwu, who grew up in Guilin, has a poem: "How is Yandang Stone, very similar to Guilin Peak." According to his opinion, at least Yandang and Guilin can be tied.</p>
<p>If tourists are interested in visiting Yandang, if there is anything they don't understand, they can inquire with the Mountain Management Committee at any time. They welcome tourists and will give satisfactory answers.</p>

<h3>Yandang Itinerary</h3>
<p>— Y·K·</p>
<p>The Shenbao on April 13th has a Yandang travel plan. Now, the along-the-way situation is briefly described below. Traveling from Shanghai to Yandang is no less than several hundred miles, and travelers often suffer from the long distance. It is provided for reference for those who are interested, and they can enjoy the famous mountain. This group departed from Shanghai at 3 pm on the afternoon of the day, and traveled the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway for about 7 hours before arriving in Hangzhou. The car went straight to the Xin Xin Hotel. Because the hotel is located in the West Lake, it is quiet and beautiful, and the price is not high. We had dinner and stayed overnight in the hotel. The next morning, we got up at 7 am and set off for Nanxing Bridge to cross the Qiantang River. Each car was charged one and a half yuan for the ferry fee. We passed through Xiaoshan Shaoxing on Xiaoshao Road and turned north at Shaoxing Station, passing through East Lake, which is also a famous scenic spot in Shanyin. After a brief tour, we went to Caoe Station, turned south into Shengxin Road, and went to Sheng County. We then went east to Xinchang. The road to the east is to Fenghua, and the south is Xintian Road (Xinchang to Tiantai). At Xinchang Station, we asked the villagers for boiled water and filled our stomachs with the prepared dry food. After passing through Tiantai, we added gasoline and went to Linhai. There was a section that passed through a mountain ridge, which was about four or five hundred feet high. At Linhai, we crossed the Lingjiang River, which flowed very rapidly. The ferry could only carry one car at a time, and it took half an hour for a round trip. Now there were five cars, which took two and a half hours. In the future, if we use a steamboat to cross the river, the time can be saved a lot. We then went to Huangyan, where we needed to cross the river again. The Didi Bridge was actually a pontoon bridge, which could only be used by pedestrians and not cars. This time we had more experience in crossing the river. Each time after two cars crossed the river, they separated and went ahead, so that the time was saved a little. When we passed through Zeguo County, it was already dark. We arrived at the Water Rise Ferry and crossed the river again. The water here was shallow, so we didn't need a rudder and used a pole instead, so the boat didn't take up space and could carry two cars at a time. The distance between the two banks was shorter, and it could be solved in about ten minutes. From here to Yandang Mountain, it was only two miles. We arrived at our destination around 9 pm. This route from Shanghai to Yandang is 372 miles long.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Dengwei Four Cypresses</h3>
<p>On the left of Dengwei Mountain, there are four ancient cypresses, named Qing, Qi, Gu, and Guai (clear, strange, ancient, and monstrous). The "clear" one stands straight and is as lush as a green canopy. The "strange" one lies on the ground in three curves, shaped like the character "之". The "ancient" one has a bald and wide top, half-rotten like a palm. The "monstrous" one has a spiral body, with branches and trunks all like that. It is said to be from before the Han Dynasty.</p>
