<p>時評</p>
<h3>對於川災的感想</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>號稱天府之國的四川省。最近遭遇着空前的旱災。據說災區延長到一百三十四縣。餓莩增加到三千五百餘萬。這不能不說是一個嚴重的局面了。省府方面雖已籌足十四萬元的急賑欵項。預備六百萬元的工賑計畫。然而杯水車薪。還是無濟於事。所以一方籲懇慈善團體踴躍輸欵。來救目前燃眉之急。一方請求中央發行賑災公債。以為從容善後之圖。除此固然沒有其他更好的方法。可是我們覺得備受創傷的四川人民。臨到如此天災人禍的緊張關頭。對於如何促成災況的遠因。以及此後怎樣覓取生存的途徑。趁這機會。也自該有一番精密的打算。</p>
<p>過去的川省。誰都知道是軍閥割據之局。每度火併之結果。所給予川人的痛苦有多少。物力凋敝。人丁潰散。精髓敲盡。元氣斵喪。種種情形。想來已足使人黯然。至於直接為武人所斷送的生命。間接因兵事而荒蕪的田野。這迭次累積的損失。怕更難有適度的統計。頗聞當時川人完納田賦。竟有已至民國五十四年者。這也可想見其中搜括手段的一斑了。無論怎樣富饒之區。也經不起如此重重的剝削。所以這次川荒的形成。固然說是屬於天災。但一究其所以召致災情強化之故。也未嘗沒有人事的因果關係。明乎此。則川人對於今後兵禍之復發。該如何下一個决心去遏絕他呢。</p>
<p>自從中央决意經營西南。川省也頗居一時的重心。當時軍事長官親往巡視。與川當局商洽一切。並且駐節了好一回。帶去不少的利便。經此一來。川省已與中央打成一片。原可好好的建樹一下。以恢復原有的繁榮。可是好亂的莠民。還不時受人利用。肆其破壤的陰謀。三月以前。一度喧傳成都發現大規模的祕密組織。最近又散播許多無稽的謠傳。幾乎攬亂安寗的空氣。這一段經過。目下雖已解釋明白。同時卻可知道蓄意禍省的毒菌。還潛滋於社會的黑暗面。隨時有其蠢動之可能。這在川人自屬大為不利。對於如何撲滅的方法。總該有一個適當的準備𦆵好。須知眼前一幅災民流離圖。是何等激刺的事實啊。</p>
<p>關於趕辦川賑。中央已撥公債一百萬元。抵押現欵七十餘萬匯渝。而全國賑務委員會委員長朱慶瀾。也已飛往重慶著手散放。川民廳長並且提出許多方案。預備施行。似乎治標方面。總不至於沒有辦法。若為懲前毖後著想。該怎樣運用整個的力量。來防止元氣的復傷。是則有待於今後川人自己的努力了。</p>

<p>［倫敦］財相張伯倫在下議院中提出一九三七—三八年預算案之後、反對派工黨議員卽前海軍大臣亞歷山大、卽就西班牙北部此爾波港問題、提出質問、並激烈攻擊政府所採態度、謂共“與英國最優良的傳統精神、完全相悖”又謂、彼西國國民軍所施行之封鎖辦法、乃係非法行動、結果足使比爾波港居民、盡成餓殍、英國政府茲乃表示屈服而拒不保護本國商船、殊屬不當、抑比爾波港實際上並未封鎖、有之、亦唯由英國政府予以封鎖耳、此其所為、乃係遠反不干涉協定、而有利於國民軍、“局勢如斯”、吾人不得不要求政府、變更政策、否則卽當辭職、以謝國人云、海軍大臣霍爾爵士當卽起立答復、說明海軍常局對於西國內戰當事雙方、保守絕對中立態度、按之海軍部所獲消息、西班牙巴斯克邦沿岸、確有國民軍軍艦多艘、游弋監視、而政府軍海軍實力、則較為薄弱、又沿岸一帶、國民軍確曾敷有水雷、并有政府軍掃水雷船兩艘、曾於六星期以前、觸水雷而沉沒、可為明證、又謂英國政府、曾通告西班牙國民軍政府、謂國民軍倘對英國商船、有所行動、决非英國所能容忍、最後則謂、按之目前局勢、政府原定方針、未嘗不可修改、此爾波港一帶封鎖狀態、若並非切實有效、則海軍部自當首先承認之、而改變現所採取之態度云、至是、反對派自由黨領袖勞合喬治繼起發言、對於政府所行不干涉政策、就大體上表示反對、略謂、“西班牙內戰當事雙方之中一方面有外國軍隊十萬員名左右、參加作戰、軍械旣極犀利、設備又至齊全、另一方面、則有外國軍隊一萬至一萬五千助戰、霍爾爵士倘以此為不干涉政策推行有效之明證、則確屬鑿鑿有據矣、“外相艾登最後發言、略謂政府對於西國內戰、現願嚴守中立、此際局勢、亦並非一定不移者云、至是、工黨提出動議案、反對下議院延會、以表敵視政府之意、結果下議院卒以一一九票對四九票否决此項動議、（中央社二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］前海軍大臣工黨領袖亞歷山大聲稱、如英政府承認其所封鎖者不僅為軍火、且為民食、則英政府直默認聽令婦孺死於飢餓之狀况而已、渠在未接到更詳確情報以前、不能承認西國民軍對於比爾波港已施行有效力之封鎖云、海相賀爾答稱、英國海軍政策、在保護海上英船、政府不擬派艦駛入西班牙領海、此非因有危險、但以此興或將礙及不干涉協定耳、政府確信不干涉政策之新局面、刻在開始發展中、故以為不在火上加油、乃極重要事、且政府應在精神上及形式上、維持不干涉政策云、（中央社二十日路透電）</p>

<h3>未來大戰的可怖（下）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>科學殺人的新方法</p>
<p>防禦飛機，還有一種更巧妙的方法，那是在距離工業區域數哩外的曠野中，佈成工業區的形狀，由天空下望，彷佛有鐵路，有河道，有工廠，有道路，接着還有鄕村。飛機當然揀重要地點拋擲炸彈，却不知都落在曠野之中，毫無损害。那是要在較大的區域上佈雙層烟幕，上層却是假的風景，英人曾試用過這個計畫，得到巨大的效果。</p>
<p>更厲害的方法，是一种騰空的機關槍，那是豎升的飛機，裹面地位很小，只裝着一尊機關砲，還有一個發砲臺。它的造費很廉，但是不能作攻擊之用，因為它直上雖然極快，橫動是慢而笨拙的。所喜它的成本很小，所以能集成大隊，在敵軍飛機來攻的當兒，數分鐘內，便能一齊上升，在敵機飛行的平度迎戰，敵機一則因眾寡懸殊，二則因槍砲力弱很難取勝。</p>
<p>飛機建造，還有其他許多發展。德國的飛機，現在多用第色爾引擎，因為這種引擊，可不必燒汽油。這一層在缺少油料供給的國家，是很關重要的。同溫層專炸機現在還感覺缺乏養氣，跟高空太冷的困難？但目下仍在試驢哩。飛行潛艇，—或鑽水飛機，—那是在天空能飛在水下能行的一種戰具。它可以飛到敵方艦隊之中，又可以摺擭兩翼，幹潛艇的工作。飛行坦克車是一種設備齊全的坦克車，裝在飛機之上，飛到敵軍陳綫的險要地點，把它降下。“降落傘大隊”是許多人挾着大砲的零件，用降落傘在敵軍陣綫後降落，數分鐘內可以把大砲零件裝配完成，向敵軍轟擊。這個方法，尤其是蘇聯，試騐已吿成功。</p>
<p>“死離心力”戰具，是一位美國人發明，賣給英國的，現在日本也探用了。那是－架新時代化的“大衛”投石機，一面把鋼彈加入，一面那許多機關便像電一般快的轉動，每分鐘能發彈三萬三千枚。雖然不能像機關槍那般取準，但在兩軍接近的當兒，這種殺人的利器是極可怕的。還有一個優點，它不用火藥跟銅。</p>
<p>陸地戰鬥，還有一種獨人使用的機關槍。這種利器，匪徒已用了多時。洞穿鐵甲的來福槍，也成功了，從前尋常的來福槍跟機關槍所不能低擋的坦克車，現在也有個對頭了，因此新坦克軍已把鐵甲加厚。</p>
<p>最後還有飛箭式的魚雷，升入同溫層，能夠飛行極遠的距離。郵政局曾試騐用這個新利器運送郵件，但還不能及遠，並且降落的地點，常常差訛。最有趣味的發展，是一種宣傳飛機，那是一架極大的飛機，上面裝着收發無綫電報機，小印刷機，放大聲浪器，跟同類的機檢。蘇聯現在備有這種飛機多架，它們能飛到敵境，散播宣傳品。</p>
<p>還有毒瓦斯燒夷彈高炸性的炸彈，跟上次戰爭所用過的許多殺人利器，現在都佈置齊全，準備屠殺。這些新武器，各國的軍政部無一不知道，差不多已同樣地置備了，所以下次戰爭，不問它來勢怎麼急驟，似乎决不會在數小時內或數日內可分勝負的。一定又將兵連禍結，殺得天昏地暗，在這種戰爭中，一國的經濟力跟它的工實財政，將為最後决定勝負的因素。（完）（譯紐約國報）</p>

<h3>山西的民族工業（上）</h3>
<p>— 徐弋吾</p>
<p>工業概况</p>
<p>民國廿一年山西太原兵工廠改組為西北實業公司機廠的一部，農工機器廠，製紙廠，機車廠，一切省內應用的機器，應有盡有，不惟可以供給全省各縣之用，就是陝甘青寗各省的輕工業機器也都仰賴於它。紡織廠，織造𤺲，太原，榆次，都有大規模的工廠，山西人民的衣着，差不多都購用本省的出品。省內的輕工業發達了，外來物品就碰到了堵墻。民族工業的基礎打定了，民生問題就得到解决的希望。</p>
<p>山西是我國產煤鐵最富的省份，煤與鐵是工業的主要原料。也可說是輕重工業的引擊。山西有了這兩宗工業的原料，什麼生產事業，都可以舉辦了。據我所知，山西省營的工業計有下列各種：</p>
<p>鍊鋼廠是重工業的基礎，山西的鍊鋼廠，僅僅以廿萬元的少數資本創辦成立了。現在廠房及內部機器，都已建置完竣，將來出品側重於那一方面，現在還不得而知。如果需要側重軍事工業，那麼鍊鋼廠就可以負起很大的任務。鐵工廠的規模很大，出品除農工機器零件外，還附設着機車廠，同蒲鐵路的客貨車，都是該廠的出品。織造廠有毛織機四十部，棉織機一百廿部，員工一千三百餘人，出品有毛嗶嘰，毛毯，線呢，粗細布，毛巾及日用綿織品等四十餘種。毛織品每尺只售三毛至七毛錢，綿織品每尺只售八分至一毛六分錢，廉價的物品，卻質地堅固，樸素可觀。山西人本來是崇尚儉樸的，廠家出品能夠迎合主題這種心理，不僅營業上獲得利潤，且使舶來品無法推銷，晉華烟草公司，出品有五台山，雲崗等十餘種烟捲，雖然裝璜欠美觀，烟絲製法也不見好，可是山西人的提倡土貨的精神，卽是一根捲烟，也非土货不吸。我曾拜訪过山西的省政常局，巨商富賈，他們招待客人的是雲岗牌捲烟，一位商會委員吿訴我說：“山西沒有捲烟出品之前，我們吸的是本地旱烟，水烟。直到晉華公司有了捲烟出品，我們才有吸紙烟的習慣，現在該公司的出品也跟著提倡土貨的潮流普遍銷售了。綏遠，寗夏的捲烟市塲，晉华公司却佔了銷路的第二位。我們的設想是：大家喜歡吸捲并州四家日報館，都是購用晉隆的一面光報紙，雖然在印刷方面覺得不便，但是他們不因此烟，必須本省有這項生產，不然每年的漏𢨴就很可觀了。何况我们還想把西北各省外溢利权挽回過來呢？記得該公司才發行捲烟，大家都以為烟味不好，不大購吸，後來省府通令各縣，先自公務员提倡購吸，於是民眾才踴蹤推銷，照別的功令一樣重視了。本省當局這种以身作則的精神，怎使人民不威動呢？“晉降造紙廠，規模雖不大，可是出品却樣樣都有，毛邊紙，一面光的報紙，價格很低，除供省垣各机关應用之外，並且逐步向各縣推銷。太原的報館，如晉陽，太原，山西而購用日本貨</p>
<p>產銷辦法</p>
<p>太原各廠家，出產情形，略如上述。我現在將他們推銷的情形介紹如下：太原有一家土貨商塲，這是人人所知道的。這商塲近在民國廿二年才開辦，內部組織，經理以下分設營業，會計，總務三部。營業部主持的人是太原頗有商業經騐的商人，會計部的人員，卻是綏署經濟處的幹員，總務部呢，主要的任務是交際，這一部的人員，天概很熟悉外省情形，關於商業的聯絡，在上海，平，津，他們都嚴密的做到了。營業方面的門市部份，分布疋，皮革，文具，捲烟，農工器具，麵粉等部。陳設條理井然，店夥招待遇到，比較各大商埠的國貨公司整齊得多。土貨商塲，全省已設有四十七個分銷處，國內主要商埠，都設有辦事軍處，而各鐵路局，輪船公司，并特約了推銷員，土貨商塲有了這樣健全的組織與營業的技術，所以近年的營業有如下的進展：民廿四年營業額四十廿萬八千餘元，廿五年上半期五十一萬餘元，下半期一百○八萬元，贏利以幾何等級一五％之此例，望利支配則為：公積金一五％，員工獎金一五％，股柬提成一五％，剩餘利潤二○％，則供各種公共事業的津貼費。</p>

<p>僑胞須要切實團結</p>
<p>據雷氏談我國喬居南非華僑、群數約三千餘人、多係粵籍當初前往者類多作工、現在則頗多營商以雜貨衣館菜園等為主、尤以日常用品如罐頭食物醫油等店鋪較多、華僑初度去非、約在一八八五年間、後南非聯邦政府、頒行黃金條例、禁止有色人種在金鑛區域居住置產、按南非之屢訂苛例目標、不在華僑而在印人、蓋現在南非印人極多、然限制亞洲人及有色人種之苛例、已涉及國人、當初在何績總領任內與非方商談、訂立紳士協定、于垂成之際、徒以少數不法者陰謀毀摧•致未成事實殊為可惜、現聯邦政府、復有亞洲人賃居新例之訂立、除此當由政府與之交涉外、所該注意者、厥為我僑胞須努力於相互間團結、不應目相摧殘蓋同處異城如共一生命也、同時更宜注重於清潔衛生及一切知識之培養、</p>
<p>開拓南非市塲要點</p>
<p>至談南非商務上今後展望、則前途尚屬光明、國人開設店鋪約八百餘所、營業尚佳、南非人口千萬、而有七日萬土人、該處士人、尚慣用華貨、惟此間與南非交通不便、過去國貨運往者不多、今後應設法溝通之、南非無甚工業出品、所用者大部由國外輸入、故我國貨如向該地推銷、頗有希望、惟須注意者、（一）為適應白人用者、如地毯等家庭用品宜取品質精良、色調美好、價格昂廉、固所不問、蓋居住南非白人、均為巨當、而喜用上品也、（二）適合於一般士人之物品運往銷售、須注意其價格低廉、同一貨品、國貨如能低廉於其他各國、銷路必廣、否則難受大部土人之光顧云</p>

<p>麥氏接見記者談、本人因尚未目擊菲島實况、故對於菲島行政、尚無蒼計劃可吿、關於菲島一九三九年實現獨立、此須視美菲經濟專家所組共同委員會、對將來美菲間之經濟問題洽商結果而定、蓋政治獲得自由、如經濟不能獨立、亦殊無意義、要之、經濟問題、必須先求得解决、美國總顧及菲島利益、未有不盼其能早日獨立也云云、</p>

<h3>上海商業儲蓄銀行二十五年度營業報告（續）</h3>
<p>二，幣制之穩定　除物價升漲外，本年度最重要之經濟事件，當為幣制穩定與農產豐收，亦為助長物價之主要分子•我國自民國二十四年度十月初改革幣制以來，對外匯價，始終穩定於五年來平均率左右，雖於中日外交緊張之際，屢受投機者之攻擊，迄未受有重大影響，僅於秋間法郎價值非常不穩之時，為應付英美匯兌劇烈變動計，將我國對外匯率之變動范圍，略為擴大，自法國正式停止金本位後，亦已復趨穩定•此種穩定之成績，為多數人士所始料不友，足以證明當時穩定之匯率，確能合於國情。蓋自幣制改革以後，對外貿易，顯見好轉，本年度進口貿易凡九萬四千一百餘萬元，較二十四年度增加二千二百餘萬元，出口貿易凡七萬零五百餘萬元，較二十四年度增加一萬三千萬元之譜，入超為二萬三千五百餘萬元，較二十四年度咸少達一萬零七百餘萬元之鉅，則由於匯價降低，且始終穩定，故出口貿易之增加，遠較進口貿易為甚也。此項入超數字，因華北走私之猖獗，固未可據為信史，然如幣制不予改革，入超必更不止此數，可無疑義。抑自匯價穩定以後，海外華僑匯欵，亦較往年為盛，或足彌補走私之支出而有餘•故本年度之國際收支，卽或轉為順差，亦極可能，對於幣制之穩定，更具有莫大助力。而對外匯價、旣於𢁙制改革時降低達二成之譜，國內物價，亦於本年度內隨之陸績上漲，其間亦具有因果之關係焉。</p>
<p>三，農產之豐收　然所以造成國際收支之好轉，對外匯率之適當固為一大原因，而另一大原因，則為本年度農產之豐收，卽物憤之升漲，亦無不與臺收有密切之關係也。我國往年米糧棉花之輸人，為量極巨，本年度因農產豐收，進口米棉等商品，大為减退，計米榖一項，本年度進口為二千七百萬元之譜，而二十四年度進口則達八十九百五十餘萬元，計减少達六千三百萬元之譜。小麥項，本年度進口為一千一百八十餘萬元，而二十四年度進口則達三千四百八十餘萬元，計减少達二千三百萬元左右•棉花一項本年度進口為三千六百餘萬元，而二十四年度則為四千一百萬元之譜，亦减九百萬元左右。三者合計則進口方面之减少者，達九千萬元之譜。反之出口方面因本國豐收而增加之商品，其重要者計有棉花二十四年度為二千一百餘萬元，本年度則為二千八百餘萬元，計增六百四十餘萬，米榖及小麥二十四年度公一百萬元之譜，本年度則增為五百萬元左右，計增四百萬元，卽此三項而言，出口之增加者上達一千萬元有奇•吾人試以進口之减少者，與出口之增加者，合計，則得一萬萬數百萬元，適合人超減少之數，故謂人超之減少，由於我國主要農產之豐收。亦幾無不可也•抑農產豐收之時，適值海外榖價上漲，兼以匯價降低，鑲根充盈，迄能維持相當價格，未致演成榖賤傷農之故事，用是農村購買力，頗見增加，日用必需之制成品，如棉紗棉布等，無不銷增價升，而自本年下半期起，物價指數，始有顯著之上漲，苟非農產豐收，曷克臻此•由此可知本年度我國經濟狀况之改善，雖由於幣制穩定，政局統一，及物價之回漲等等，而繫於農產之豐收者，其關係之重大，實高於任何其他份子也。</p>
<p>本年度豐收，究竟至若何程度，據各方面估計，就重要作物言，當以棉花為最，本年產量最低估計約為一千四百萬擔，較之去歲約增七成有奇，實為空前紀錄。其次為大豆，凡一萬二千六百萬市擔，花生凡五千五百萬市擔，均較二十四年度增加達成以上。再次為芝蔴凡一千七百餘萬市擔，高粱為一萬五千萬餘市擔，均較二十四年度增加成至一成半左右•至米稱收獲估計凡十萬萬市擔，較二十四年度約增白分之四之譜•小麥收獲估計凡四萬六千餕萬市擔，較二十上年度增加百分之八•此外次要之農作物，如大麥玉米菸葉等，其收獲量亦多增加。就各省而言，山東，安微，湖北，湖南，四省沾益最厚，山東棉花，花生，安徽米稻，小麥，黃豆，棉花，湖北棉花，小麥，黃豆，湖南米稻，綿花等，均收獲特豐，所以增加該省人民才購買力者，當非淺鮮。其次為河北，江蘇，江西，河南，山西等省，他如陝西，除棉花項豐收外，關於糧食作物，大部欠佳，當地民食，頗成问題，以致本年度下期有大批麵粉，陸續運銷該省。浙江方面，次要之農作物如黃豆菜子蠶豆等，亦均歡收，可謂為豐年之例外云。</p>
<p>四，金融之平穩因農產豐收，幣制穩定，金融狀況，亦遠較往昔為平穩•法幣發行，因逐漸撤退現銀之使用，增加頗速，年底總額為十一萬萬元之譜，具有充實準備，信用日固•銀錢業倒閉情事，大見减少，經營上之困難，遠較昔减。惟大多數行家，均已感受金融恐慌之打擊，不得不整理其往昔缺陷，亦未能迅連發展財計務，新行莊之開設者，並不甚多。工商業旣逐漸恢復景氣，銀錢業存欵，顯見增加，資金市塲，頗有趨於鬆濫之勢，就上海拆息言，常在八分左右，絕少特殊變動，觀察前途，頗有與於低金利之形態。同時資金流動率亦較往昔為連，本年度上海票據交換，合銀錢雨業計算，較之往年，約增二分之一云。（未完）</p>

<h3>物理系展覽概況</h3>
<p>本系自民國二年創辦迄今，已達二十四年，主其事者，先有熊博士𪄵薛，朱，三張教授，近由徐景韓教授，李慶賢博士先後繼任，積極壁劃，系務蒸蒸日上。本屆展覽程序如下。</p>
<p>（一）無線電學組　無線電是新興的科學其應用的廣大，進步的迅速，不是其他任何科學所能及。即以市上出售的收音機而論，也是日新月異，使人目眩。但究其實際，卻逃不出幾種基本的原則和線路本組陳列着各種基本的結構，舉凡收發音機，輸送機，長波，超短波都備。</p>
<p>（二）數學組　數學是一切科學的骨斡，並且居於領導地位，往往先有玄妙的算式，人知其然而不能應用，隔了百十年後，方知可以吻合於　種科學，而藉此豁然地開拓了一個新路徑。所以數學也可以說是科學之源，我們常然也要有所展覽。然而數學可以陳列什麼呢？算式理論，都在數學家的腦子裹，一時無查窺其奧秘。我們祇得把數學用的工具，如立體與曲面的模型，還有各種奇妙的圖解陳列出來，以供人們的欣實。</p>
<p>（三）普通物理學組　本組陳列普通物理中各種簡單而重要的承教實驗，使初學者於學理更能透澈，未學者發生興趣，</p>
<p>（四）力學組　物理學以力學為出發點，其原理最為基本。我們特把各檔度量衡的器具，測定物性的儀器，與靜力舉動力學的實騐一依次陳列。</p>
<p>（五）工場　物理儀器因為結構精確，價值根貴，且都是外貨，一年漏。𢨴不少。我們為了要自給起見，辦了一個小小的工場，這工場雖僅有短短的歷史，而規模已組具，出品亦有數種，請參觀我們的工具和我們的自製品罷。</p>
<p>（六）光學組　本組把光學儀器，如顯微鏡，照相機等。和光的各種現象的顯示實騐如反射折射干涉等。凡能於日光下陳列的都分鬥別類的排列着。</p>
<p>（七）熱學組　本組於熱學的各種儀哭與實騐陳列頗多，即以溫度計一項論已有十餘種之多，其餘尚有新改進的儀器亦不少。</p>
<p>（八）電學組　電的應用任何人都知其偉大，一切日常生活，交通，國防，輕重工業，都不能無電。所以電學組確實值得參觀，這裹有精細的測量器，日常的應用品與電機等。</p>
<p>（九）近代的物理學與光學組　二十世紀的物理學，已入研究物質內部的階段，物質內部目不能見，手不能接，如何可以測知。但是物理學家已經有實騐法證明。本組有分光儀，放射性陶亂，安克ltJ光”除，颼鸛斤導。諸君參觀了大概可以知道物質的內部是什麼？因為這一陳列室是暗室，所以尚有光學上奇妙的現象，於黑暗中方能見到的也展陳在這裹。</p>

<h3>生物系沿革及展覽概况</h3>
<p>本系已有二十餘年之歷史。為國內大學創設生物系之最早者。初由祁天錫博士主辦。旋由胡經甫戴蓀張和岑三先生相繼主持。經營慘澹。各種設備。漸臻完善。動植物標本，各種圖表及胚胎學，動植物組織學，昆蟲學，植物形態學。寄生動物學，微菌學等之玻片。更稱美備。近一年來。得教部之提倡及補助。益有進展。畢業論文。素注重於本國及本地生物之探討。故對於蘇省動植物。研究尤多。</p>
<p>本校地處三吳。物產豐富。採集甚優。鑒於各學術機關及學校實騐材料。皆由海外運來。一漏扈甚大。乃有設立生物材料處之計劃。得洛氏基金社及科學社之補助。得以實現。成立已上餘載。足供國內各處應用。餘如“兩月刊”之出版。於生物學界更有貢獻。本處以歷年經騐所得。對於技衛方面。頗多閘發。如動物解剖及血管有色注射等技術。更屬難能。歐美各國及全國各省授權本處出品。均博得好譽。現尚繼績努力。以副各方之厚望焉。</p>

<h3>東吳大學生物系細菌學實騐室之一部</h3>
<h3>東吳大學化學系無機化學實騐室</h3>
<h3>發刊詞</h3>
<p>— 丁緒言</p>
<p>我們應當承認德國之復興，蘇俄五年計劃之成功，意大利之戰勝阿比西尼亞，都是他們崇尚科學努力研究的結果，都是他們民衆在科學上都有相當程度，相當認識，相當信仰的結果，中國為古文明國家之一，哲學，文藝，美術等，較之歐美各國，末遑多讓，甚且有凌而上之的地方。惟中國科學之幼稚落後，無可諱言•所以科學救國，科學化運動，在今日實有萬分迫切之需要。</p>
<p>可是中國近年來之開展覧會者，所在多有。如美術展覽，文獻展覽，書畫展覽，風起雲湧，各擅勝場。獨對於科學展覽，尚不數親。固然科學展覽，因有材料，人事，經費，時間，地位等乖關係，辦理極感困難。然而我們能畏難荀安嗎？我們能不利用謀外餘暇及校內理學院的設備作小規模的—惠而不費的—科學化運動嗎？</p>
<p>科學展覧會之在中國，假使川國立大學去辦，才可有大規模的表現，才能驚天動地般的引起人民之注意或贊賞。現在由一個私立學校—東吳大學—來嘗試，它在物質方面是感覺缺乏的，它只有本着“苦幹，硬幹，快幹”的精神，去向科學前途作“三年一次”的努力邁進。我們不敢存着什麼奢望雖然，此次東吳科學展覧會之意義，據我看來，略有下列四種：</p>
<p>一，它能擴大青年的科學知識　近年政府的教育方針注重實科。青年學子，不由得要多走到科學路上去。他們求知慾切而尋常他們的知識，多從教科書本上得來，在科學展覽會中，有種種儀器，標本，藥品，模型，機械，圖表以及參考文獻等等，可使他們從實物方面，得到直覺的觀念。如此才能引起他們研究的興趣，才能使地們的智慧更有深切印象，和格外適用。</p>
<p>二，它可將科學作公開的研究：　中國資源豐富，但如何利用資源，如何用精密的科學方法，切實研究諸待解決的問題，科學同志們儘可分工合作，一致努力。例如某一問題，同時頭有多人從多方面去研究。貢獻容有不同，效果却更圓滿。假如全國各大學及各學術機關、常有科學展覽會之組織，大家可以互相觀摩，豈不甚好？何况公開研究，也是科學家應保持的態度？</p>
<p>三，它可使科學大衆化和通俗化：　一般民衆對于科學的效用，往往不免懷疑甚至藐視。或認為“雕蟲小技”，無裨家國；或認為偏于理諭，不切日用。這些謬誤觀念，若不用有效的方法，加以無形的矯正，在科學進步上實有莫大的障碍。全國各處如能不時舉行科學展覽，不但以上觀念，不難一掃面空，民衆也都多少的受科學洗禮。等到那時，中國科學化運動，才算成功。</p>
<p>四，它可使大家覺司到科學研究不像一般所想像的那麼易或那麼雖。尋常大家對于科學家，不是不大相信即責雖太嚴。譬如有一問題，他們來問，如果因有牽涉太多一時得不到答案。他們總覺得不滿意。這是他們將科學看得太容易太簡單的原故。反之，有人以偽科學比什么都難素性不去理會它。那知問題，雖然複雜，仔細研究，畢竟頭頭是道。科學展覽對于一點微塵，一滴血液，一個原子或電子，都有清楚確聲的觀察，都有簡單澈底的說明，使大家可以相信要解決許多科學上的問題，非拿著儀器藥品去實騐，非應用文獻去參考，非準備著相當精力和時間去犧牲，那是毫無希望的•但是這些實騐參考和犧牲，是有相當價值的。只要肯去實騐，肯去參考，肯去犧牲，一定有相當結果的。所以科學展覽會的意義之一，是要使科學家的苦心孤詣，得到大衆的同情和了解，那末他們不至說科學為易如反掌或難于登天了。</p>
<p>東吳大學為提倡科學喚起民衆及公開研究起見，爰有科學展覽會之舉。此會前數年也開過。不過本屆更有中國唯一之淡水生物研究所，在本校止式成立。同時校中新體育館及新女生宿舍亦舉行落成內禮。一舉數利，機會難得。不過關于此次展覽會籌備，布置，諸未盡善，尚希熱心同志及各界人士格外原諒并進而教之。廿六年四月廿日于東吳大學理學院</p>

<h3>兒童健康比賽</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>邇來我國社會人士，對於兒童健康，漸知注意。例如各機關的舉辦兒童健康比賽，便是一個例證。最近本市又將有這項比賽舉行了。中華衛生教育社上海分社，定於本月二十五日舉行兒童健康比賽大會，凡本市公私立各幼稚園小學，均由各該校長廣微學生及學生家屬兒童，踴躍參加。又中華慈幼協會在閘北設立之上海慈幼診療所，亦定於下月二十四日起，舉行大規模的兒童健康比賽三天，參加者定為五百名，分嬰兒組幼稚組及幼童組三部分比賽。</p>
<p>舉辦兒童健康比賽，目的在指導兒童衛生，及增進兒童健康，用意可說是極善的。因為兒童為未來民族的生力軍，兒童身體之強弱，關係於民族的盛衰，十分重要。故各國對於兒童健康問題，皆甚重視，政府及衛生教育各團體，無不致力於兒童衛生方面的工作。我國之知注意兒童健康，尚是近年來的事。但因賴社會人士的努力，成績雖不算如何良好，却亦頗有影響了。像屢次舉行兒童健康比賽，很能喚起一般家庭為父母者的注意。然而要保障兒童健康，僅舉辦比賽，是不夠的。比賽之後，我們既明白兒童的健康狀態，便應設法提高兒童的體格，使達到強壯的地步。否則舉行比賽，不過是熱鬧一回而已，對於兒童，並沒有多大的益處。</p>
<p>就一般情形看，我國兒童之健康，顯然是缺陷極多的。因為普通家庭的兒童，因環境及各種關係，大都缺乏教養。故兒童體格，強健者少，而衰弱者多。我們試以學校兒童說，據前本市舉辦小學生結核菌檢騐，結果五校受騐人數二九一六人，已傳染者二一三七人，未傳染者七三九人，反應未知者四十人。由這個統計看，有結核菌者，竟達百分之七十以上，數目可說是不少的。又前不久，本報教育欄登一報吿，本市舉行小學生體格檢查，結果在九千名受騐學生中，有缺點者達八千人，佔全數百分之九十，這數目更屬驚人了。我國兒童身體之不健全，於此可見一斑。</p>
<p>故我們以為關心兒童健康，舉行比賽，固然要緊，但比賽之後，謀補救辦法，尤為重要。例如本市小學生的健康狀態，是極可憂慮的，非設法救濟不可。這一點希望衛生教育當局，加以注重。近來日本對於國民健康，深切注意。這次文部省所提出之在學者健康施設費，已由議會通過，行將以十五萬元欵項，舉辦全國青年體格檢查，期間五年，調查全國青年有無病狀及其活動能力等，並講究提高國民健康的具體方法。這種辦法，我國若能仿行，對於國民體格，定必有相當的帮助。</p>
<h3>春之行</h3>
<p>— 萍子</p>
<p>擠在一個載重車的里面，路又是那麼地高低不平，眞感覺到莫大的苦惱了。</p>
<p>“要什麼時候纔走盡這顚簸的路程呢？”—這樣地問了自己，自己也是不知道，或許如生命的路程吧，到任何時都可以站住的，但是在這極短的時間內，將不會停止，因為眼睛望到的，祇還是無盡的原野。</p>
<p>天也熱了起來，說是春天，却也使人不耐了。車輪捲起的黃土，像烟一樣地從後面奔了上來，沒有來得及用手絹掩了口鼻的被嗆得咳嗽着；每個為汗所潤着的臉上，或濃或淡地附了土的顏色。看了別人的臉笑了起來，自己的臉也是惹人笑的。這時節，我們到了所要到的地方。</p>
<p>那是一個以梅花出名的名勝地，到我們去的時候，所有的梅花，已經飄到地上了。</p>
<p>“呵，晚了！”—喟嘆如烟一樣裊裊地在每一個心中升起來，但這也許是不盡然的，有的人不是出神於委棄地上的花瓣，像有什麼樣的幽思重重地壓在他們心間，彷彿生長在城市里，每日為人事攪得頭昏腦亂，自己也就欣欣然，十分滿足地活着，到了這有野趣的所在，就感到一切都是新鮮，而且以為該風雅一點，便效才子佳人般地多愁善感了。</p>
<p>我可是輕鬆的，祇是如世外人一樣地望着從小山頂上流下來的清水：有人正把用紙疊起來的小船，放到水上，看能流到什麽地方。更年青一點的人呢，笑逐着浮在水面上的小紙船，隨着它們走過幽徑，穿過山鬥。</p>
<p>在我的悠想中，那為什麼不能是一個可觀的大河呢？河心是不平的，河流在那里翻了各樣的花，轉着不同的方向。於是有隆大的聲音在響着，我卻是一個人傍在那河邊諦視着。忽然我又有着涉水而過的思想，我如何能到彼岸呢，這里又沒有一隻船？我焦慮着，用手抓着頭。因為感到疼痛，我纔意識着橫在眼前的不過是一條細小的山澗水，祇要一邁步，就可以過到那邊去的。我微笑着。</p>
<p>抬起眼睛來呢，同來的人都不知道在什麼時候四散了。我也就踽踽地向着上小山的途上走去，在這幽靜的山徑中，我看到偎了行的一對對的男女們，我是漠然的，微微地冒着點汗，濕了我的頭髮。</p>
<p>一陣陣的木鱼聲音傳過來了，我就把脚步朝那面走去。終於我走到了開着一扇門的正殿，跨進了高的門檻，就看到幾個披上袈裟的和尚，跪在那塑像的面前，低沉而虔敬的聲音，打動了我的心，我脫下了帽子。</p>
<p>有多少樣的念頭在我的胸中如游魚一樣地竄游着，我茫然地走出那殿門，就在門前那石櫈上坐了下來，用手攏了膝頭，空空地望了前面。</p>
<p>樹的影子在地上為落花描好了校幹，我幻想着開白了枝頭的梅花，如又在</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>我的眼中燦爛着一樣。我欣喜地望着，可是突然有一個響亮的聲音刺入耳朶來：</p>
<p>“呵！想不到你一個人坐在這里！”</p>
<p>我仰起頭來望他，覺得他那種怱忙的樣子，有點可笑；我並沒有回答他，祇點了點頭。</p>
<p>“在等你一個人呢，就要回去了。”</p>
<p>“要回去了麼？”—我懷着滿腔依戀之情，懶懶地站起身來：重復望着一枝落盡了花的樹，一地從那樹上落下來的花。</p>
<p>眞是倉促呵！—我一面嘆息一面跟在那個人的後面走着。</p>
<h3>三月的寂寞</h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>當和煦的春風，艷麗的陽光，飄灑到人間。人們像感激着聖恩般底，幸福呵幸福呵！池浜裹的水笑着春風，緩緩地，緩緩地，流着三月的睛空，池水泛着柔和的蔚藍。</p>
<p>三月的晴空是寬曠的，白雲朶朶，浴着春水飄浮，飄浮，而幻化，而消逝於不整齊的建築物輸廓的下面。</p>
<p>大街上有賣削光嫩山薯，春笋，和枸杞籐的人了，時鮮品呢，可也祇是那些老饕者的口福，在這季節裹大多發着胄呆症，他們的滋養料是窗外𧰟陽的天，溫好的流風，一些抽象的自然界的產物。</p>
<p>處處鐵柱石壁，生話眞被鎭壓得苦悶透了，石子士敏士跟鋪上鋼板似的世界，要花上面找支萌芽，就同水底撈月般的夢想。油墨氣息濃厚的日曆已在一天天的把春帶來人問，可是連公園也沒開逛，整天價被生活碾磨着，和自然隔膜着的人，連季節的更調都非常的漠然了。</p>
<p>滿明瓦窗爽亮的陽光，一兩隻小雀在簷下唱着清麗的曲子，牆腳邊見到的那枝紅梅，凋謝，落英片片，一個下意識的想念，一絲哀愁，一刻的茫然感，呵，三月，三月是寂寞的！</p>
<p>當明朗的三月的陽光被煤烟遮成一遍陰黯時，當鳥語被汽笛驚失時，當落英殘技被清道夫掃除時，眼前是否春已來到？其他關於春的例證有無？找尋，隨時隨地的，可偏都失望。</p>
<p>這天却是意外，在一個腥味充溢着的菜市上，發現了春之報道者——黃黃的油菜花。於是我心坎不禁暗暗狂喜了。在販子的篾竹筐裹，一紥一紥，很整齊的堆砌着，那簇擁成球的黃色的小花，那淡綠的蕊，那翠色的苞，纍纍如珠，在纖微裹透視出大自然神秘的孕育，“一粒砂裹見世界”，萊克的哲理深深地刻上我的心版了。容含於黃色花和翠色苞間的露珠，受着陽光的映射，發出晶瑩的光輝，於是眼前感到耀眩了。水顆的晶瑩在菜花間呢，還是在自己的眼眶裹？眞連神經感覺亦模糊了，一點潤濕在心坎。</p>
<p>眼前雖是眼朗的三月，却有着颗雨天的心。</p>
<p>雨天的心是寂寞的，三月的陽光是寂寞的，被禁錮在古菴裹的年輕孀婦似的，耐不住的性靈的桎梏呵，生命力被鎖閉進陰黯絕望的環境，這是時候了，需要一把適合的鑰匙，或者一把鐵錘也爽快，需要一些火，或者一些炸藥的力量也可以。我要打開沉悶環境的倉庫，我要照亮這裹那裹的陰黯，我要炸裂出全部被禁錮的生命力，我終於要驅走沉於生活底層的寂寞……。</p>
<p>“我不是季節的俘虜，”我這樣判决了自己。</p>
<p>可是三月之白晝的深巷整個地被寂寞包圍着了，連狗子踱過的足音亦清晰地聽到，白陽抹上高牆，正同一張貧血症患者的白晳臉，隔牆那株棗樹依然探出蜷屈的枯枝，三月猶未見新綠，不知誰家又在彈着披耶娜，每個音符都是顫慄的，三月，春天了呵，何需這點哀怨的調子呢！呌人閉上心扉，呌人有了凄清感！這耐不住的三月的寂寞，是需要一顆重鎊的炸彈的。</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Among the motions discussed at the Central Political Council meeting on the 21st, the most important was the amendment of the principles of the Land Law. Because this case has a huge impact on the national economy, many members who attended offered detailed opinions. The discussion lasted for two and a half hours, and only half of the entire case was discussed, which shows the importance the members placed on this case. It is reported that the important points discussed today include: ⑴ unifying land names; ⑵ establishing a land bank; ⑶ supporting independent farmers; ⑷ establishing land adjudication tribunals in municipal and county judicial organs, with two trials as the final instance, to reduce the people's litigation burden; ⑸ land surveying and land registration; ⑹ mediation of land rights disputes; ⑺ registration of public land; ⑻ housing relief; and ⑼ tenants requesting expropriation of their farmland in accordance with the law.

<h3>Newly Appointed Ambassador Visits Foreign Minister Wang</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to diplomatic sources, the newly appointed Italian Ambassador to China, Crolli, visited Foreign Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 PM on the 21st to pay his respects and discuss matters related to presenting his credentials. He left at 4:20 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 21st)</p>

In addition, the new Finnish Envoy, Mr. Yrjö-Koskinen, is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing at 4:00 PM on the 26th to pay his respects to Foreign Minister Wang.

<h3>Kawagoe's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Ambassador Kawagoe decided to go to Shanghai tomorrow and is scheduled to take the Shanghai Maru on the 28th of this month or the Nagasaki Maru on May 2nd to return to his country to report in detail on the Sino-Japanese negotiations since last year. He will make important suggestions for adjusting national relations. The ambassador spoke to someone at 2:00 PM on the 21st as follows: I will not explain what opinions I will put forward until I have reported to Foreign Minister Sato. As for opening up Sino-Japanese national relations, the Chinese side has not expressed any specific opinions, so it cannot be considered that the difficult situation at the beginning of the negotiations since last year has been removed. The problem is extremely complicated. I plan to think carefully on the way back to my country. I will not know when I will return to my post until I arrive in Tokyo. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Newspaper Reports of False Information is the Claim of a Minority</h3>
<p>It Will Naturally Subside if There is No Factual Basis. Shimizu Said to the Central News Agency Reporter</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Recently, a small number of newspapers in Tokyo have often published rumors that stimulate the feelings of the people of China and Japan. The reporter specifically visited the Japanese Embassy to inquire about the situation. Secretary Shimizu came out to meet with him. According to the conversation, since the suspension of Sino-Japanese negotiations, the movement of Japanese citizens advocating a re-understanding of China has indeed been quite enthusiastic. The opinions published by the Yomiuri Shimbun and other newspapers are the claims of another group of people. I dare not guess the rise and fall of the two forces. It depends on how the facts develop in the future. If the rumors have no factual basis, they will naturally subside soon. As for what you call the background, I think the Yomiuri Shimbun and other newspapers are large newspapers with status, so they should not publish this. The circulation of the "Evening Empire" is extremely small and will not have much impact. Shimizu is scheduled to accompany Kawagoe to Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd and will stay for about four or five days before returning to Nanjing. Kawagoe will return to his country to report on his duties after meeting with Counselor Hidaka. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<h3>Important Clues Obtained in the Kidnapping Case on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway</h3>
<p>The Location of the Bandit Den and the Hostage Has Been Learned. Rescue Procedures Are Underway</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] In the kidnapping case on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, the bandits captured last night were sent to the Muqiaotou Detachment Headquarters for interrogation this morning. They all admitted to the crime. They were then transferred to Henghe for strict handling. At 3:00 PM today, a bandit was caught buying a ticket to board a train at Penggong Station. The police found banknotes from the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, the same as the hostage's banknotes, on his body. He was taken to Henghe for interrogation. The military police surrounded Huang Weishan in five routes. As a result of the search and suppression, the bandit den has been destroyed, and several bandits have been captured. Together with the bandits captured last night, there are a total of seven bandits. Important clues have also been obtained. After strict investigation, the location of the bandit den and the hostage has been learned. The entire case is clear. The rescue of the hostage is now underway. Surrounded by the military police on all sides, the entire case can be resolved within a day or two. (Special dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] In the kidnapping case of Xu Baiyuan and Xu Binhua on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, the Security Office, the Provincial Public Security Bureau, and the police teams of Hangzhou County, Yuhang County, and Wukang County have been contacted to encircle and search Huang Weishan for the second time. As of the morning of the 21st, the result was that, in addition to the hostage's coat, no trace of the bandits was found. However, the mountain borders Yuhang, Wukang, Anji, and Xiaofeng counties, and is also connected to Guangde, Ningguo, and Kunshan in Anhui Province, with a circumference of several tens of miles. It is not yet known whether the hostage is hidden in a mountain cave or dense forest. Now the military police are blocking and sealing off all the important roads in the mountain to prevent the bandit den from moving to Xiaofeng, Tianpingtang, which is not far from the mountain, so as to avoid difficulties in the rescue. As for the two bandits captured by the Second Security Squadron in conjunction with the Gucheng Zhuangding Team, they were left in Baizhangwu because it was inconvenient to transport them at night. The reconnaissance team leader, Deputy Team Leader Zhao, was sent to interrogate them overnight. On the way to Luoyao Temple, they encountered seven or eight bandits and exchanged fire. The bandits could not hold on and fled into the mountains of Puquan Ancient City. The authorities are now stepping up their efforts to purchase leads and pursue them. The three suspected bandits, male and female, captured on the evening of the 19th, and the one hostage rescued, were related to another kidnapping case in Xiaofeng. It was clear after interrogation that they were not related to this case. (Special dispatch from the 21st)</p>

It has recently been circulated to various telephone companies and business telephone companies to implement it uniformly from May 1st. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the Sichuan Disaster</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Sichuan Province, known as the "Land of Abundance," is currently experiencing an unprecedented drought. It is said that the disaster area extends to 134 counties, with the number of starving people increasing to over 35 million. This must be said to be a serious situation. Although the provincial government has raised 140,000 yuan for emergency relief and prepared a 6 million yuan work-for-relief plan, these efforts are a drop in the bucket and are still ineffective. Therefore, on one hand, they are appealing to charitable organizations to actively donate funds to alleviate the immediate crisis, and on the other hand, they are requesting the central government to issue disaster relief bonds to ensure a proper recovery. While there may be no other better methods, we feel that the wounded people of Sichuan, faced with such a critical juncture of natural disasters and man-made calamities, should also take this opportunity to make a precise plan regarding how to address the root causes of the disaster and how to find a path to survival in the future.</p>
<p>In the past, everyone knew that Sichuan Province was in a state of warlord separatism. The suffering inflicted on the people of Sichuan as a result of each round of fighting, the depletion of resources, the scattering of the population, the extraction of essence, and the loss of vitality - all of these circumstances are enough to make one feel disheartened. As for the lives directly sacrificed by the military, and the fields indirectly devastated by the war, the cumulative losses are even more difficult to accurately calculate. It is said that at that time, some people in Sichuan had already paid land taxes up to the 54th year of the Republic. This shows the extent of the means of extortion. No matter how rich an area is, it cannot withstand such heavy exploitation. Therefore, while the formation of this Sichuan famine can be said to be due to natural disasters, when investigating the reasons for the intensification of the disaster, there is also a causal relationship with human affairs. Understanding this, how should the people of Sichuan make a resolution to prevent the recurrence of war in the future?</p>
<p>Since the central government decided to manage the southwest, Sichuan Province has also occupied a temporary center of gravity. At that time, military commanders personally went to inspect and discuss everything with the Sichuan authorities. They also stationed there for a while, bringing many conveniences. As a result, Sichuan Province has integrated with the central government and could have been built up properly to restore its original prosperity. However, the unruly elements are still being used from time to time, carrying out their schemes of destruction. Three months ago, there were rumors that a large-scale secret organization was discovered in Chengdu. Recently, many unfounded rumors have been spread, almost disrupting the peaceful atmosphere. Although this episode has now been explained, it also shows that the toxic bacteria that are intentionally harming the province are still lurking in the dark side of society, with the potential to stir at any time. This is greatly disadvantageous to the people of Sichuan. There should be an appropriate preparation on how to eradicate them. One must know what a piercing fact the picture of displaced disaster victims before our eyes is.</p>
<p>Regarding the urgent relief of Sichuan, the central government has allocated 1 million yuan in public bonds and remitted over 700,000 yuan in cash to Chongqing. Zhu Qinglan, chairman of the National Relief Committee, has also flown to Chongqing to begin distributing the funds. The director of the Sichuan Civil Affairs Department has also proposed many plans to be implemented. It seems that there will be a way to treat the symptoms. If we want to learn from the past and prevent future problems, how should we use the entire strength to prevent the recurrence of vitality injuries? This depends on the efforts of the people of Sichuan themselves in the future.</p>
<h3>Washington Reports that China Plans to Borrow Foreign Debt</h3>
<p>Building Railways and Developing Production - A Natural Trend with Political Stability</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese officials here announced today that the Chinese National Government may issue foreign debt to build railways and develop production, thereby strengthening domestic institutions. The Chinese government has recently been preparing to repay the 1911 Hukuang Railway loan and the 1919 Chicago Bank loan, and has been negotiating with the United States to clear old debts, such as the Pacific Construction loan. This move to repay old debts will enhance China's foreign credit, making it easier to issue new loans. If China issues foreign debt again, it will generally seek funds from London first, followed by the United States. US government officials told the Associated Press that they had not heard of China's borrowing plans, but that this would not be surprising, as the Chinese government's income has increased recently and the political situation is very secure. Currently, except for the three northeastern provinces, all provinces are under the rule of the National Government, and the political situation is extremely stable. (20th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun Publishes Headline Stating that Britain Suggested Cooperation with Japan on China</h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Claims Ignorance - British Representative in Tokyo Claims It Is Exaggerated</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Nichinichi Shimbun today published a news item with a large headline stating that Britain recently informally informed the Japanese government of its willingness to establish Anglo-Japanese cooperation in China, or an Anglo-Japanese understanding. With Britain initiating this proposal, Anglo-Japanese cooperation negotiations in China can begin soon. These negotiations will first focus on establishing a solid foundation for Sino-Japanese relations in order to seek the normal operation of Chinese customs. (Central News Agency 21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] A Reuters reporter recently visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ask whether the news in this morning's Nichinichi Shimbun about Britain's informal notification to the Japanese government of its willingness to establish Anglo-Japanese cooperation or understanding in China was accurate. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson immediately stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was completely unaware of this development and that the Nichinichi Shimbun was completely fabricated. Other sources related to the government also stated that the news published by the Nichinichi Shimbun was unfounded and purely exploratory. (Central News Agency 20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] This morning, the Nichinichi Shimbun reported that Britain had recently informally stated its intention to cooperate with Japan on China, and that Britain's proposal had three preconditions: ㊀ consolidating Sino-Japanese relations, ㊁ safeguarding Britain's existing rights and interests in China, and ㊂ jointly assisting China. It is said that the content of the cooperation is that, on the one hand, Britain recognizes the existence of the Manchurian organization, and if Japan has no territorial ambitions in North China, Britain also recognizes Japan's special relationship and interests in North China. On the other hand, Japan respects Britain's existing rights and interests in China and takes joint action in financial and economic policies towards China. The newspaper also stated that, regarding this point, Foreign Minister Sato Naotake strongly advocated at the Three-Minister Conference on the 20th when discussing the Soviet Union and China that in order to realize Japan's continental policy, it is necessary to make Britain clearly understand Japan's position. Therefore, for the sake of Anglo-Japanese cooperation, it is necessary to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. It is heard that Sato's proposal has been supported by Army Minister Sugiyama Gen and Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa. Therefore, the newspaper predicts that the two countries will soon begin negotiations on mutual cooperation, starting with the China problem. The newspaper further speculates that Britain's motivation for making the above proposal at this time is twofold: ㊀ to protect Britain's existing economic development in China, and ㊁ to adopt Britain's traditional policy of maintaining a balance of power in the Far East. Regarding the former, the newspaper pointed out that Britain's recent investments in various enterprises in China have made Britain feel that in order to maintain its current position, it is best to have Japan recognize its superior position in East Asia and obtain the guarantee of cooperation in order to stabilize East Asia. Regarding the latter, the newspaper stated that Britain feels that assisting the Soviet Union in increasing its position in the Far East is excessive, so it feels the need to contact Japan to restrain the excessive development of the Soviet Union in the Far East. However, the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that he was not aware of the above news beforehand, and expressed that such news is likely speculation by the Nichinichi Shimbun. Also, according to British sources here, the claim that Britain has made a proposal to Japan is at least an exaggeration. However, it is true that British diplomatic representatives in Tokyo are constantly urging the Japanese government to resolve the smuggling problem, and this problem is of course closely related to the problem of adjusting Chinese relations. As for all the other rumors, they seem to have two intentions: ㊀ to obstruct contact between China and Britain and indirectly resist the alleged hard-line attitude of China towards Japan, and ㊁ to test the atmosphere in London and Moscow. Japan seems to have recognized the mistake of continuing to oppose China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The conclusion is that although the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations is difficult to achieve directly between the two countries, if Japan's relations with Britain or the Soviet Union can be improved, Japan's position in China will at least be strengthened. Therefore, the above news is worthy of attention. (Central News Agency 21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Advocates Child Protection</h3>
<p>Must Be Studied</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Advisory Committee on Social Issues of the League of Nations continued its meeting today. The vice chairman, Yokoyama, the Japanese Consul General in Geneva, explained the situation in which the Japanese government is striving for the happiness of children, stating that Japan is a country with an overpopulation, so it pays special attention to this issue. At this time, the population policy adopted by the country is to improve the people's physical condition and improve their knowledge, not to increase the population. He therefore proposed that the Advisory Committee make recommendations to the governments of various countries, advocating that the League of Nations should closely study the issue of child protection.

<h3>Japanese Army Minister Concerned About Physique of Recruits</h3>
<p>Visibly Declining</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Army Minister Sugiyama Gen strongly emphasized the necessity of maintaining national health at the cabinet meeting on the 21st, saying that he had previously inspected the Kansai region and visited Wakayama Prefecture and the Kyoto region near the industrial city of Osaka to inspect the physical examination of rural recruits. He discovered that the physique of rural recruits, which had always been considered superior to that of urban recruits, has been declining year by year. Thinking of the future of the country, this is truly worrying. The reason is that each place is close to the commercial and industrial cities of Osaka and Kobe. Only about three or four tenths of the children in rural areas stay in the countryside. Most of them go out to seek work, bring disease back to the countryside after cultivating its source in the city, and transmit it to the countryside. This tendency is gradually becoming a national phenomenon, so it is necessary to give it special consideration in order to maintain national health. (21st Allied Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Labor Unrest Becomes Increasingly Serious</h3>
<p>Miners Brew General Strike</p>
<p>[London] The machinists at the British Beardmore factory voted today by 1,015 votes to 64 to continue the strike that began on April 18. All strikers should be subsidized by the machinists' union. At the same time, British miners everywhere have voted on the outcome of the Nottingham mining dispute and have now voted to issue a strike notice. A total of 444,546 votes were in favor of supporting the striking miners in Nottingham, while only 61,445 votes were against. According to this vote, the Miners' Union has the right to take action to announce a national strike if the negotiations in the Nottingham dispute fail and the problem of union recognition is not resolved. Miners' representatives will meet in London on the 30th of this month to consider the issue of issuing a strike notice. The dispute in the Nottingham mining area arose from the demand by the miners to have the right to join the national union rather than the local union. Negotiations ended in stalemate. The Minister of Mines recently declared in the Lower House that he was willing to do his best to seek a resolution of this dispute. (Central News Agency 20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>World Economic Conference: United States Willing to Participate</h3>
<p>But Unwilling to Take the Lead　Japan Also Declares Willingness to Attend</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt recently gave a speech to the press, discussing the talks conducted by British Labour Party figure Ramsay MacDonald and German leader Hitler. He stated that he has always advocated improving the world economic situation, but the President did not specify what methods he intends to use to achieve this goal. Regarding the declaration made by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain yesterday in the House of Commons regarding national defense expenditure in the 1937-38 budget, he said that countries rearming have different purposes. Some do so to facilitate attacks on other countries, while others do so purely for self-defense and not out of their own volition. These should not be treated the same.

<p>[Washington] Congressman Thies today announced his advocacy for convening a world monetary conference, but President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull advocate that European countries should take responsibility for convening it. Hull believes that countries will find it difficult to achieve effective international action unless they first establish regional agreements. However, Undersecretary of State Welles stated that if Europe convenes such a conference, the United States would be willing to participate, because the arms race will lead to cultural bankruptcy. We must do our best to promote international military and economic restrictions. Welles was very pleased with German leader Hitler's statement to British Independent Labour Party representative Ramsay MacDonald that Germany is willing to participate in international conferences, but fears that countries have not yet considered convening any conferences. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>[Washington] There are rumors that the US government will change its gold policy. Congressman Thies has proposed requesting President Roosevelt to convene a world monetary conference. US Treasury officials remain silent on the matter, only stating that there is no change in US monetary policy. Rumors from New York suggest that the United States, Britain, and France will adopt a "gold quota system," restricting gold purchases to the United States only, in order to prevent gold from flowing into the United States. Government officials have refused to discuss this. According to financial experts, the rumors from London and New York that the United States will change its gold policy are intended to disrupt the market. The financial community is very concerned about the proposal by Congressman Thies, leader of the silver faction in the House of Representatives and initiator of the silver purchase plan, to convene a world monetary conference.

<h3>Spanish Rebel Blockade of Ports</h3>
<p>Continued Discussion in the British House of Commons</p>
<p>[London] After Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain presented the 1937-38 budget in the House of Commons, opposition Labour Party Member of Parliament and former First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander immediately raised questions about the issue of the Port of Bilbao in northern Spain and vehemently attacked the government's stance, saying it "completely contradicts the finest traditional spirit of Britain." He also stated that the blockade implemented by the Spanish Nationalist forces is an illegal act, the result of which will be that the residents of the Port of Bilbao will starve to death. The British government's expression of submission and refusal to protect its own merchant ships is inappropriate. Moreover, the Port of Bilbao is not actually blockaded; if it is, it is only blockaded by the British government. This action is a violation of the non-intervention agreement and benefits the Nationalist forces. "Given the current situation," we must demand that the government change its policy, or else resign to apologize to the people. First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Hoare immediately stood up to reply, explaining that the Admiralty has always maintained an absolutely neutral attitude towards both sides of the Spanish Civil War. According to information obtained by the Admiralty, there are indeed several Nationalist warships patrolling the coast of the Basque region of Spain, while the naval strength of the government forces is weaker. Furthermore, the Nationalist forces have indeed laid mines along the coast, and two government minesweepers sank after hitting mines six weeks ago, which is clear evidence. He also said that the British government has notified the Spanish Nationalist government that Britain will not tolerate any actions taken by the Nationalist forces against British merchant ships. Finally, he said that, based on the current situation, the government's original policy is subject to revision. If the blockade of the Port of Bilbao is not actually effective, then the Admiralty will be the first to acknowledge it and change its current attitude. At this point, opposition Liberal Party leader Lloyd George spoke, expressing opposition to the government's non-intervention policy in general, stating, "One side of the Spanish Civil War has approximately 100,000 foreign troops participating in the fighting, with extremely sharp weapons and complete equipment, while the other side has 10,000 to 15,000 foreign troops assisting. If Sir Hoare considers this clear evidence that the non-intervention policy is being effectively implemented, then he is indeed very certain." Foreign Secretary Eden spoke last, stating that the government is currently willing to strictly adhere to neutrality in the Spanish Civil War, and that the current situation is not necessarily immutable. At this point, the Labour Party proposed a motion opposing the adjournment of the House of Commons to express its hostility towards the government. As a result, the House of Commons rejected this motion by a vote of 119 to 49. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from London, 20th)</p>
<p>[London] Former First Lord of the Admiralty and Labour Party leader Alexander stated that if the British government acknowledges that what is being blockaded is not only military supplies but also civilian food, then the British government is directly tacitly consenting to the starvation of women and children. He cannot acknowledge that the Spanish Nationalist forces have effectively blockaded the Port of Bilbao until he receives more detailed information. First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare replied that the British naval policy is to protect British ships at sea and that the government does not intend to send warships into Spanish territorial waters, not because there is danger, but because this might hinder the non-intervention agreement. The government firmly believes that a new phase of the non-intervention policy is now beginning to develop, so it believes that it is extremely important not to add fuel to the fire, and that the government should maintain the non-intervention policy in spirit and form.

<p>⊙ Bilbao: The British grain ship "Seven Seas" has today entered the Port of Bilbao and has been warmly welcomed by the government forces, showing that the rebel blockade plan is largely ineffective. A member of the Basque government stated that the ship was escorted by a British destroyer to a point fifteen miles offshore, and then escorted into the port by the government fleet. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>⊙ Bayonne: The British cargo ship "Seven Seas," loaded with grain, set sail from the Port of Saint-Jean-de-Luz yesterday and has now arrived at the Port of Bilbao in northern Spain. According to a communiqué issued by the information office of the Basque Autonomous Region of Spain, there are currently cruisers and auxiliary ships belonging to the government forces within the territorial waters of the autonomous region, providing strict protection, and ship navigation is without danger, as can be seen from the safe arrival of the "Seven Seas" at the Port of Bilbao.

<p>[London] In order to transport grain to the ports belonging to the Spanish government forces and provide food relief to the people, the Independent Labour Party has raised funds to establish a shipping company dedicated to this task. The board of directors of the shipping company is scheduled to meet today to pass the articles of association and decide on the course of action. According to Independent Labour Party Secretary Brockway's statement to a Havas reporter, the company has decided to purchase a ship for 40,000 pounds, which has now been raised, but the insurance issue remains to be resolved.

<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain Presents Budget to the House of Commons</h3>
<p>Deficit Reaches Over 14 Million Pounds　Increased Income Tax and New Profits Tax</p>
<p>[London] The main points of this year's budget presented by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain this afternoon in the House of Commons are as follows: ㊀ Income tax will be increased by three pence per pound, from four shillings and nine pence to five shillings. ㊁ A new tax will be implemented, called the National Defence Contribution. All businesses engaged in industry and commerce with annual profits exceeding 2,000 pounds will be required to pay this tax, ranging from one-fifth to one-third, depending on the extent of their profit growth, taking into account depreciation over the past four years.</p>
<p>The estimated revenue for this year is £847,940,000, and the expenditure is £862,848,000, resulting in a deficit of £14,898,000. This amount can be reduced to below £2,000,000 due to the increase in income tax (last year's revenue and expenditure offset showed a deficit of £5,597,000).</p>
<p>㊃ The preferential tax on silk stockings produced in the British Empire will be revised. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from London, 20th)</p>
<p>[London] London circles generally say that the sixth budget presented by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain during his tenure is particularly prudent. People are not paying much attention to the increase in income tax, as this was expected. However, they are paying close attention to the new tax named "National Defence Contribution," viewing it as a revival of the "excess profits tax." This new tax was not expected by the general public, and its detailed measures are currently difficult to predict. However, industrial stocks have not been affected much as a result, and market prices seem to be on the rise. This new tax, on the whole, is particularly fair, as it is estimated to generate 25 million pounds per year, which is more convenient than drastically increasing income tax rates. This budget can make British financial policy clearer, as the Chancellor has predicted that the revenue from various taxes can be expected to increase, and he naturally does not want to hinder the inflationary trend caused by the cheap money policy. At the same time, the "National Defence Contribution" can guide companies to invest a large portion of their income in industry, thereby reducing the risk of labor unrest. As for whether companies will change their registration to foreign countries due to excessive taxation, it is difficult to predict. Before the budget was announced, oil stocks were deeply concerned about the imposition of new taxes, so the market was particularly quiet. Now the price has risen sharply. According to the recent rumors of "the revival of the American gold panic," which were immediately denied by the authorities, and now the budget has been announced one after another, with no surprising points, it is hoped that market rumors will cease from now on. Metal prices have already risen first, and tea merchants are very happy because the budget did not increase the tea tax. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from London, 20th)</p>
<p>[London] Before British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain presented this year's budget to the House of Commons, the venue was already full, and the public gallery was also overflowing. Among them were nobles, ambassadors from various countries, and high-ranking special envoys. Chancellor Chamberlain kept the contents of the budget strictly secret beforehand. Even his cabinet colleagues only learned about the contents of the budget last night. This was because last year, he informed his cabinet colleagues of the contents of the budget before the 12th, which resulted in a leak of information and caused a great uproar, and Colonial Secretary Thomas had no choice but to resign to take responsibility. This time, Chamberlain had to be particularly cautious.</p>
<p>Chamberlain entered the parliament at 3:42 pm, and the whole venue erupted in applause. Among the audience, there were four former Chancellors of the Exchequer, namely Baldwin, Lloyd George, Churchill, and Horne. When Chamberlain stood up to speak, the whole venue became silent.</p>
<p>Chamberlain first described the past situation and said that from this year onwards, national defense expenditures will continue to occupy a very important position in national finances for several years to come. He then said that the deficit currently known in the budget is £5,597,000, including debt repayment. If national defense expenditures are not included, then the deficit after debt repayment will be £2,250,000, and the debt repayment will be £13,000,000. The amount by which regular revenue exceeds expenditure, not counting debt repayment, is £10,500,000. The revenue from inland taxes, customs duties, and production and sales taxes is as expected. Customs duties and production and sales taxes generated £14,500,000 more than estimated, while income tax, surtax, and inheritance tax generated £5,500,000 less than estimated. According to the Chancellor, inheritance tax is a measure of trade increases and decreases, and it is gratifying that current revenues exceed £29,000,000. The improvement in tax revenues is the result of trade expansion and increased purchasing power. The Exchange Equalization Fund still shows a surplus, so he proposed to retain the old amount of £224,000,000. The Chancellor explained that although there were savings in the civil administration budget, the national defense budget exceeded the estimate by approximately £8,000,000. The total national defense expenditure is £188,600,000, which is approximately £50,000,000 more than last year's total. If the world environment is better now, this amount can be used for debt repayment and other purposes. The Chancellor said that he did not want to include the budget deficit in this year's budget and intended to ask Parliament to find ways to remedy it, as in 1931, 1932, and 1933. Based on the current tax revenue situation, the estimated total tax revenue can reach £847,950,000, so the deficit will be £14,898,000. Last year's expenditure on the highway budget was approximately £25,000,000, and this year it will be £28,500,000. The civil administration budget is a total of £419,000,000, and the national defense budget is a total of £198,000,000, and the additional civil administration budget of £10,000,000 must be added to the national defense expenditure figure, and the proposed debt of £80,000,000 must be removed, along with the debt repayment of £234,000,000. The total amount of expenditure in the budget is £862,848,000. The Chancellor predicted that the good economic situation will continue this year, and the activities of the coronation ceremony will also contribute to this. The Chancellor predicted that customs duties and production and sales taxes are expected to increase by £12,000,000, and income tax, inheritance tax, surtax, and taxes on oil, tobacco, and beef are expected to increase significantly. Although new taxes must be avoided, the new contributions of taxpayers will enable the country to quickly achieve its security goals. The standard rate of income tax will increase by three pence per pound, from four shillings and nine pence to five shillings.</p>
<p>The increase of three pence in income tax can increase revenue by £13,000,000 and lower the deficit to below £2,000,000. The Chancellor announced that a new tax will be applied to those engaged in industry and commerce with annual profits exceeding £2,000. The tax is very complex, starting from one-third of the fixed profit and up to one-fifth. Losses in the past four years will also be included. The Chancellor stated that this tax is a special temporary contribution from the people to national defense, estimated to generate £2,000,000 this year and £20,000,000 to £25,000,000 per year.

<h3>Roosevelt Submits Austerity Plan to Congress</h3>
<p>Requests 1.5 Billion Yuan for Relief Work　Advocates Balancing Next Year's Budget</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress today, revising the original budget proposal for 1937 to 1938, requesting an appropriation of 1.5 billion yuan for relief work. At the same time, the President also proposed an austerity plan and indicated that he would submit another tax bill when the next Congress convenes to make up for the budget shortfall. According to the President's budget proposal in January of this year, the estimated deficit for this year was 2,248,267,774 yuan, and the budget could be balanced next year. The current amendment is for a deficit of 2,557,000,000 yuan this year and a shortfall of 418,000,000 yuan next year. The various heavy taxes that "could have been abolished this spring" will remain in effect, and the President requested that Congress not make additional appropriations outside the budget, as the flood prevention plan currently under discussion by Congress may require excessive funds, and the expenditure on public works should not exceed 500 million yuan per year. The President defended the national defense expenditure, saying that while he is trying to expand the military regardless of bankruptcy, the US budget for this year is still 131.8 million yuan less than the usual 1 billion yuan. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt ordered the submission of a revised budget proposal to Congress today, requesting a balanced budget in the next fiscal year and recommending reducing the expenditures of various administrative departments and clearing the assets of various temporary agencies. President Roosevelt also advocated raising funds for relief work. According to the revised budget at the end of the current fiscal year, i.e., June 30, 1937, there is an approximate net shortfall of 2,557 million yuan, an increase of 30.9 million yuan compared to the budget in January. President Roosevelt predicted that income tax revenue in the 1937 fiscal year would be 41 million yuan less than estimated. He does not intend to propose new taxes during this session of Congress. The 1938 budget expenditure will be reduced by 45.7 million yuan, and revenue will increase by 168.2 million yuan, for a net shortfall of approximately 41.8 million yuan.

<h3>The Horror of the Future Great War (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>New Scientific Methods of Killing</p>
<p>Regarding defense against aircraft, there is an even more ingenious method: in the wilderness several miles away from the industrial area, a shape resembling an industrial area is laid out. Looking down from the sky, it appears to have railways, waterways, factories, and roads, followed by countryside. The aircraft naturally choose important locations to drop bombs, but they do not know that they are all falling in the wilderness, causing no damage. This involves laying out a double layer of smoke screen over a larger area, with the upper layer being a fake landscape. The British once tested this plan and achieved great results.</p>
<p>An even more formidable method is a levitating machine gun. This is a vertically ascending aircraft with a very small interior, equipped only with a machine cannon and a firing platform. Its manufacturing cost is very low, but it cannot be used for attack because although it ascends very quickly vertically, its horizontal movement is slow and clumsy. Fortunately, its cost is very low, so it can be assembled into a large force. When enemy aircraft come to attack, it can ascend together within a few minutes and engage the enemy aircraft at its flying altitude. The enemy aircraft will find it difficult to win because of the disparity in numbers and the weakness of the guns.</p>
<p>There are many other developments in aircraft construction. German aircraft now mostly use diesel engines because this type of engine does not need to burn gasoline. This is very important for countries lacking oil supply. Is there still a lack of oxygen and the problem of high-altitude cold for stratospheric bombers? But it is still being tested. Flying submarines—or underwater aircraft—are a kind of war equipment that can fly in the sky and move underwater. It can fly into the enemy fleet and fold its wings to do the work of a submarine. A flying tank is a fully equipped tank mounted on an aircraft, flown to a dangerous location on the enemy line, and dropped down. The "parachute brigade" consists of many people carrying parts of cannons, parachuting behind enemy lines, and assembling the cannon parts within minutes to bombard the enemy. This method, especially in the Soviet Union, has been successfully tested.</p>
<p>The "death centrifugal force" weapon was invented by an American and sold to the British. Now Japan is also using it. It is a modernized "David" catapult, adding steel balls on one side, and then many machines rotate as fast as electricity, firing 33,000 rounds per minute. Although it cannot be as accurate as a machine gun, this killing weapon is extremely terrifying when the two armies are close. Another advantage is that it does not use gunpowder or copper.</p>
<p>In land battles, there is also a machine gun used by a single person. This weapon has been used by bandits for a long time. Armor-piercing rifles have also been successful. Tanks that ordinary rifles and machine guns could not resist in the past now have an opponent. Therefore, the new tank army has thickened its armor.</p>
<p>Finally, there are arrow-type torpedoes that rise into the stratosphere and can fly extremely long distances. The post office once tried to use this new weapon to transport mail, but it could not reach far and the landing point was often wrong. The most interesting development is a propaganda aircraft, which is a very large aircraft equipped with radio transceivers, small printing presses, amplifying sound waves, and similar equipment. The Soviet Union now has many of these aircraft, and they can fly into enemy territory and spread propaganda.</p>
<p>In addition, poisonous gas, incendiary bombs, high-explosive bombs, and many killing weapons used in the last war are now fully deployed, ready for slaughter. The military departments of all countries know about these new weapons, and they have almost all prepared them in the same way. Therefore, the next war, no matter how sudden it comes, seems unlikely to be decided in a few hours or a few days. It will inevitably involve protracted warfare, killing until the world is dark. In this kind of war, a country's economic strength and its industrial and financial resources will be the final determining factors for victory or defeat.

<h3>Implementation of Private Loan Registration in Beiping City</h3>
<p>Sales permitted after tax supplement, and strict prevention of private goods from overflowing</p>
<p>Beiping Communication: Since the beginning of smuggling by Japanese ruffians and traitors in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), private goods have been entering the city in a continuous stream, with a great momentum that cannot be stopped. Among them, rayon, sugar, and kerosene are the most numerous, followed by hardware and electrical materials. As a result, all merchants are filled with private goods, piled up like mountains. The Changcheng Branch Office of the Tianjin Customs Administration stationed in Beiping, in order to remedy the situation, sent personnel to inspect various businesses. The measures determined at that time were roughly that all private goods found would be confiscated, and merchants selling private goods would be detained and sent to the court to be sentenced according to the law. However, merchants felt that the inspection was too cumbersome, so they submitted a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to devise appropriate measures. Some legitimate merchants, due to the impact of smuggling, suffered heavy losses, and also submitted a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce expressing the merchants' sentiment that they were not worried about heavy taxes but about inequality. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, fearing that the delay would lead to bankruptcy of businesses, contacted the Municipal Government and proposed that the Municipal Government, Customs, and Chamber of Commerce jointly form a private goods investigation office, allowing merchants to report and register themselves in order to maintain commerce. After repeated discussions, the Customs believed that this was inappropriate, so the office was not established, and now the proposal has been cancelled. It has been changed to first handle the registration of private goods. The registration procedure is that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will draft a "Inventory Report Form," which includes the business name, address, type of inventory, quantity, etc., and notify all businesses. Those who have private goods in stock will go to the Chamber to collect the report form, fill it out, and send it to their respective trade associations, which will then forward it to the Chamber of Commerce, and then submit it to the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government will notify the Customs Administration stationed in Beiping to send personnel to investigate. Only after the investigation confirms that the inventory matches the report form can it be permitted to supplement taxes and sell. This measure has already begun, but many merchants who sell private goods do not understand the purpose of registration, so they are mostly waiting and watching. As of now, there are very few who have registered, most of them being silk and cloth. As for the registered private goods, the Customs Administration stationed in Beiping has not yet sent personnel to investigate, so various inventories cannot be sold. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce specially appointed members Di Zhanjiang, Gao Luntang, and Sun Baichuan to be responsible for contacting the Customs Administration stationed in Beiping, focusing on the investigation of registered private goods and the future disposal of private goods. Di and others have met with Zhang Yongnian, Deputy Tax Commissioner of the Customs Administration, several times. The results of the talks were quite good. Now Zhang Yongnian has appointed investigators to start investigating registered private goods on the 15th. If the investigation is consistent, they will be allowed to sell first, and then discuss tax supplementation measures. As for merchants who are watching and not registering private goods, the Customs Administration has decided to strictly crack down on them. The method is to intensify inspections. Along the Pingpu Line, the Tianjin General Inspection Office and its various checkpoints have been closely cracking down on smuggling. However, the Pinghan and Pingsui lines lack the establishment of such tax checkpoints and are only being inspected by the railway bureau on behalf of the Customs. Recently, the Tianjin Customs Administration stationed in Beiping, in order to strictly prevent the outflow of private goods, has specially set up checkpoints at the Qianmen West Railway Station, Xizhimen East Railway Station, and Guang'anmen Railway Station, which are the export points of Beiping, and appointed special personnel to be stationed there permanently in order to inspect at any time and prevent the transportation of private goods.</p>
<h3>The Provincial Government of Hubei Province Decides on Joint Public-Private Operation of Inland Waterways</h3>
<p>Shipping merchants accuse the provincial government of violating the law and appeal to the Ministry of Communications, and submit a petition to the provincial government to revoke the original decision</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: Before the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), inland waterway shipping in Hubei Province was freely operated by Shanxi merchants, with a total of more than 100 ships. There were as many as dozens of shipping companies, all competing for cargo and causing repeated tragedies. In March of the 23rd year, the then Provincial Governor Zhang Qun forcibly took over all of them for government trusteeship to implement shipping control, with a one-year term. If the reorganization was perfect, they would still be returned to private operation. The following year, the provincial government formulated a five-year reorganization plan and established the Inland Waterway Shipping Administration Bureau to take charge. The merchants, in order to fight for property rights, repeatedly petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications, proposing several minimum requirements. The Ministry of Communications agreed to consult with the provincial government on the issues of increasing monthly interest, issuing depreciation fees, and providing relief to the unemployed in order to resolve disputes. This case was delayed and unresolved. On March 16 of this year, the 233rd meeting of the provincial government again passed a resolution to change the method of reorganizing inland waterway shipping, deciding on a joint public-private operation, merging the existing shipping agencies and reorganizing them into the Hubei Provincial Shipping Bureau in order to concentrate management and operation. The private share portion would be replaced by the current merchant-owned ships at a price, accounting for 40% of the total amount. The government share portion, in addition to the government-owned ships, would also be added with cash, accounting for 60% of the total amount. It is said that the official capital would be valued from Hanyeping tugboats and the Wuhan Ferry Wuchang Machine Factory. The merchants were greatly disturbed upon hearing this and appointed Zhang Guoen, Xie Shengkan, and Peng Qingyan as representatives to accuse the Hubei Provincial Government of violating the law and appealed to the Ministry of Communications, requesting the revocation of the original decision. The reasons are: ㊀ Regardless of whether it is a partnership or a company, according to the law, the consent of the partners or shareholders should be obtained. There is no reason to force participation. Officials should be on an equal footing with the people in private rights. If personal property is arbitrarily allocated by officials, then the civil law that guarantees private rights in the country is equal to a mere formality, and the survival of the people and social security are both affected. The Hubei Provincial Government's forced trusteeship of merchant ships "has the suspicion of infringing on private rights. However, the nominal property rights still belong to the merchants. Now they are forced to recognize shares at a price, turning the actual property rights into uncertain shares, which is a disguised confiscation, let alone having a legal basis. ㊁ The Hanyeping tugboats that the provincial government intends to use as official shares are over 50 years old and cannot be used. In addition, the tugboats with shallower drafts are almost completely decayed due to the thinness of the hull and the long years. The remaining ones have thicker hulls and very deep drafts, making it difficult to navigate the inland rivers. If they are converted into lighters, they are all over 1,000 tons, exceeding the water surface number. There is a world of difference between them and the small inland ships. It is not feasible to adapt to the situation by cutting one's feet to fit the shoes. The merchants also submitted a copy of the appeal to the provincial government for supervision and review, stating: "We have learned that the 233rd meeting of Your Government on March 16 of this year passed a resolution to change the method of reorganizing inland waterway shipping, deciding on a joint public-private operation. We are extremely disturbed and have repeatedly submitted petitions, explaining the reasons why we cannot comply with the resolution, and respectfully asking for the withdrawal of the order. We have not received a reply to this day. We have been forced to appeal to the competent Ministry of Communications on the 13th of this month in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the Appeal Law. We know that Your Government attaches importance to the people's suffering and cares about their well-being. Even if the decision is biased, there will be no prejudice in the aftermath. However, our industries are affected and the interests are closely related, so we cannot remain silent. We have to tie the bell to untie it, and the right is exclusive. After all, it is not enough to rely on Your Government to show special benevolence to comfort our expectations. Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the Appeal Law states that in addition to the appeal petition, the appellant shall also prepare a copy and send it to the official residence that made the original decision. Article 2 of the same article states that if the original decision-making authority considers the appeal to be reasonable, it may withdraw the original decision and report it to the authority that accepted the appeal. We are in accordance with the above regulations and submitting a copy of the appeal petition. We respectfully ask Your Government to supervise and review and approve the revocation of the original decision in order to relieve the difficulties of the merchants and provide real benefits."

<h3>The Truth About Lin Wenfeng's Death in Shantou</h3>
<p>Medical autopsy confirms death from illness; certain parties hope to create a second Kakuta case</p>
<p>Shantou News: The so-called Taiwanese doctor Lin Wenfeng (whose household registration report claims to be from Raoping) died of illness in Anbu, Chao'an. The Japanese Consul stationed in Shantou actually said that the deceased died suddenly and requested our authorities to conduct an autopsy at the Bo'ai Hospital, hoping to create a second Kakuta case. However, our standing authorities refused the Japanese Consul's request because the Chao'an authorities and the Shantou Municipal authorities had successively sent doctors to Anbu to examine and confirm that the deceased had died of illness and transported the body to Shantou. However, the Japanese Consul still went to extremes and secretly telegraphed to request the dispatch of a warship to Shantou, wanting to use force as a diplomatic backing. Now, two doctors each from China and Japan, together with Dr. Holder, the president of the Gospel Hospital run by the British Church, will conduct an autopsy, and Dr. Holder will preside over the autopsy. With the consent of both parties, it was held at the Gospel Hospital on the evening of the 8th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>After the Chinese and Japanese sides reached an agreement, the members of the Cunxin Shantang transported the deceased's body to the autopsy room of the Gospel Hospital. The Japanese Consul accompanied his secretary Obata and two doctors from the Bo'ai Hospital. Our side also sent Municipal Government Counselors Huang Jing and Mai Yingjun, as well as police medical officer Li Xixiang, court medical officers, etc. to the scene for inspection. At exactly 12:00 that evening, the English doctor Holder and several assistants began to work, first dissecting the abdomen and examining the large and small intestines and bones to prove that there were no signs of poisoning or bruises. Then they examined the lungs, and both lungs were completely ulcerated, confirming that he died of tuberculosis. The Chinese and Japanese doctors present also conducted a detailed study and confirmed that he had died of illness. However, in order to be cautious, the internal organs of Lin's abdomen were cut off and divided into two parts. One was handed over to our side to be sent to the Shanghai Fada Hospital for research, and the other was handed over to the Japanese side to be sent back to Tokyo, Japan for research. The scheduled research period is one month. The Chinese, English, and Japanese doctors signed the diagnosis and examination report. At 2:00 in the morning, with the consent of both the Chinese and Japanese sides, the body was still handed over to the Cunxin Shantang for encoffining and sealing, and the Japanese Consul was instructed to have his family claim it for burial. However, on the 9th, the coffin was still parked at the Taiping office of the Cunxin Shantang, and his family had not yet claimed it. According to the autopsy, the truth of the case is clear, and it is evident that the Japanese Consul's excuse to create an invasion incident is only a futile effort.</p>
<p>It is found that Lin Wenfeng went from Shantou to Anbu in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935) and established the Changan Pharmacy inside Gongyangmen. When reporting to the district, he said that he was from Raoping. Since its establishment, the business has been quite good. However, Lin himself suffered from lung disease, and he coughed every night until morning. The neighbors all knew this. On the night of the 3rd of this month, Lin acted as usual, took a walk, and returned to the pharmacy to sleep. At about 4:00, the pharmacy's handyman suddenly heard a sound like a cow panting, and then it stopped. At first, he didn't pay attention to it. But the next morning (the 4th), when he tried to wake him up, he was already stiff. Therefore, it is confirmed that Lin Wenfeng is indeed from Raoping. The fact that the Japanese side intended to falsely claim him is already obvious. Therefore, it has been decided to refute the unreasonable disturbance of the Japanese Consul this time, and to telegraph to the Provincial Government to transfer the message to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify the Japanese Embassy, requesting them to instruct the Japanese Consuls in various places not to create something out of nothing and falsely claim the nationality of the people, creating unnecessary complications, in order to promote Sino-Japanese friendship.</p>

<p>Demolition of Houses Within a Deadline for Street Widening</p>
<p>The Construction Bureau plans to build a new Suzhou this year, widening streets and rebuilding city gates and bridges. The budgeted funding of 290,000 yuan has been borrowed from six banks including Jiangsu Bank and will be paid in installments starting from June 5. The Construction Bureau has issued a notice to residents and shops on Northwest Street, Lindun Road, Shiquan Street, Shizi Street, Weiqian Street, Qian Street, Fenghuang Street, and Hulong Street to demolish and vacate their houses by May 31. Overdue houses will be forcibly demolished. Construction will begin on June 16 and is scheduled to be completed before Double Tenth Day.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Compensation for Equipment and Business Rights</p>
<p>The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce, according to Cai Jiansan and other shareholders of the former Wuxi-run Yaoming Company who held shares, claimed that they saw in the newspaper that the National Government Construction Committee planned to recruit merchant shares to develop the electricity and mining business, and the Qishuyan Changzhou Factory was also on the list. It is said that the Central Political Committee has passed the proposal and it will soon become a reality. However, the entire business of the Qishuyan Power Plant in Wuxi was originally operated by the former merchant-run Yaoming Company, and it was also registered and granted a special business license and issued shares by the Ministry. Later, in the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), it was taken over by the government. The former person in charge of the former merchant-run Yaoming Company has repeatedly requested negotiations regarding the electric light poles, lines, all equipment, and business rights, but no conclusion has been reached and the shareholders' losses have been uncompensated. Now, it is heard that merchant shares are being opened up and investment in enterprise development is being promoted. How should the original investment of the former merchant-run Yaoming Company in the Qishuyan Power Plant be concluded? Or should it be re-evaluated and compensated? It is requested to be clearly indicated for handling. The Chamber of Commerce stated that it had specially telegraphed the Construction Committee to ask how the investments and debts of each shareholder should be evaluated and compensated, and to clarify and maintain the credit of merchant shares.</p>

<p>Robber?? Kills Person Under Xiao Bridge</p>
<p>Under the Xiao Bridge on the East Outer Henan Street, yesterday (20th) at about 4:00 in the morning, a bran boat was parked when suddenly a robber came. Dressed in a gray uniform, claiming to be calling a boat to load rice, he lured the bran vendor Wang Quanyun to the southeast corner of the city and, with three other robbers lying in wait, robbed him of 10 yuan in legal currency. Quanyun resisted, causing the robbers to use knives to slash him eight times, resulting in a lot of bleeding and very serious head injuries. Later, the boatman Zhao Bingquan learned of the incident and sent the injured man to the Gospel Hospital for treatment. His life is feared to be in danger.</p>

<h3>National Industry in Shanxi (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xu Yi-wu</p>
<p>General Industrial Overview</p>
<p>In the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Taiyuan Arsenal in Shanxi was reorganized into a part of the Northwest Industrial Corporation's machine factory. Agricultural machinery factories, paper mills, locomotive factories – all the machinery needed within the province was available. Not only could it supply the needs of all counties in the province, but the light industrial machinery of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces also relied on it. Regarding textile factories, both weaving mills in Taiyuan and Yuci had large-scale factories. The clothing of the people of Shanxi was almost entirely purchased from products of the province. With the development of light industry within the province, goods from outside encountered a barrier. With the foundation of national industry established, there was hope of resolving the people's livelihood issues.</p>
<p>Shanxi is the province richest in coal and iron production in our country. Coal and iron are the main raw materials for industry and can be said to be the engine of both light and heavy industry. With these two industrial raw materials, Shanxi could undertake any kind of production enterprise. As far as I know, the industries operated by the Shanxi provincial government include the following:</p>
<p>Steel mills are the foundation of heavy industry. The steel mill in Shanxi was founded with a small capital of only 200,000 yuan. Now the factory buildings and internal machinery have been completely built. It is not yet known which aspect the future products will focus on. If it needs to focus on military industry, then the steel mill can take on a very large task. The scale of the iron factory is very large. In addition to agricultural and industrial machinery parts, it also has a locomotive factory attached. Passenger and freight cars for the Datong-Pukou Railway are all products of the factory. The weaving factory has 40 woolen looms and 120 cotton looms, with over 1,300 employees. Its products include woolen broadcloth, blankets, serge, coarse and fine cloth, towels, and over 40 kinds of daily-use cotton textiles. Woolen products sell for only 30 to 70 cents per foot, and cotton products sell for only 8 cents to 16 cents per foot. These inexpensive items are nevertheless sturdy, plain, and presentable. The people of Shanxi have always valued frugality, and the manufacturer's products are able to cater to this mentality. This not only brings profits in business but also makes it impossible for imported goods to be sold. The Jinhua Tobacco Company produces more than ten kinds of cigarettes, such as Wutaishan and Yungang. Although the packaging is not very beautiful, and the method of making tobacco silk is not considered good, the spirit of the people of Shanxi promoting local goods means that even for a cigarette, they will only smoke local products. I have visited the Shanxi Provincial Government Standing Committee and wealthy merchants. They entertained guests with Yungang brand cigarettes. A Chamber of Commerce committee member told me: "Before Shanxi had cigarette production, we smoked local dried tobacco and water pipe tobacco. It was not until Jinhua Company had cigarette production that we had the habit of smoking paper cigarettes. Now the company's products are also following the trend of promoting local goods and are widely sold. In the cigarette markets of Suiyuan and Ningxia, Jinhua Company occupies the second place in sales. Our idea is: everyone likes to smoke cigarettes, and this province must have this production, otherwise, the annual outflow of funds would be considerable. Moreover, we also want to recover the outflow of profits from the northwestern provinces. I remember when the company first launched cigarettes, everyone thought the taste was not good and did not buy them much. Later, the provincial government ordered all counties to first promote purchasing and smoking among civil servants, so the public enthusiastically promoted sales, paying as much attention as to other official orders. How can the people not be moved by this spirit of leading by example from the local authorities in the province?” The Jinjiang Paper Mill, although not large in scale, produces everything. Newsprint and one-sided glossy paper are very low in price. In addition to supplying the use of various agencies in the provincial capital, it is also gradually promoting sales to various counties. Taiyuan's newspapers, such as Jinyang, Taiyuan, and Shanxi, all purchase one-sided glossy paper from Jinlong. Although they feel it is inconvenient for printing, they do not therefore purchase Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Production and Sales Methods</p>
<p>The production situation of various manufacturers in Taiyuan is roughly as described above. I will now introduce their sales situation: There is a local products emporium in Taiyuan, which everyone knows. This emporium was only opened in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Internally, it is organized with business, accounting, and general affairs departments under the manager. The person in charge of the business department is a businessman with considerable commercial experience in Taiyuan. The personnel of the accounting department are cadres from the Suiyuan Economic Office. The main task of the general affairs department is public relations. The personnel in this department are generally very familiar with the situation in other provinces. Regarding commercial contacts, they have achieved close ties in Shanghai, Peiping, and Tianjin. The retail section of the business department is divided into cloth, leather goods, stationery, cigarettes, agricultural and industrial equipment, flour, and other departments. The display is well-organized, and the store clerks are more attentive than those in the national goods companies in major commercial ports. The local products emporium has 47 distribution points throughout the province. Branch offices have been established in major domestic commercial ports, and special salesmen have been specially hired by various railway bureaus and shipping companies. With such a sound organization and sales techniques, the local products emporium has made the following progress in recent years: In the 24th year of the Republic of China, the turnover was 402,800 yuan. In the first half of the 25th year, it was over 510,000 yuan, and in the second half, it was 1,080,000 yuan. The profits increase at a geometric rate of 15%. The distribution of profits is as follows: 15% for the reserve fund, 15% for employee bonuses, 15% for shareholder dividends, and the remaining 20% is used to subsidize various public undertakings.</p>
<h3>Gleanings from the Journey to Yunnan (3)</h3>
<p>— Bei Xuan</p>
<p>Day 7 (April 21st): Everyone was divided into groups for inspection. I was assigned to the group examining courts, prisons, social education, and relief efforts. I followed Professor Wu Zelin and the executive committee member Tong Xing to the High Court first. The court was the old county government, with 60 acres of land and hundreds of rooms, most of which were dilapidated. In the West Garden, there was an ancient well from the Ming Dynasty and a 300-year-old pomegranate tree. Beside the court, there was a portrait of the first-generation Zhang Tianshi painted by a Taoist named Jingfan, carved very well, dating from the 12th year of the Luo Zheng era. A large plaque hung in the hall, with the words "Enforcing the Law" written by the investigating censor Wu Xiangkun in the 13th year of the Wanli era, the calligraphy vigorous and lush. Court President Liang Jun described the general situation of the Jiangxi courts in a very organized manner. Jiangxi has four High Branch Courts: "Ganxian, Jiujiang, Ji'an, Hekou," and five Local Branch Courts: "Nanchang, Linchuan, Fuliang, Poyang, Yuan Yi." The Nanchang First Prison's buildings are old and can only accommodate 300 people. A new prison is being built in Jinxian County that can accommodate 1,000 people. The No. 2 prison in Jiujiang can accommodate 500 people. Currently, one-third of the prisoners in each prison are military personnel and those detained by the anti-smoking agencies. We then went to the First Prison. Although the buildings were old, the air and light were sufficient, and the management was still legal. In addition to drug addicts, most of the prisoners were convicted of robbery and murder. Political prisoners also accounted for two-tenths, mostly ignorant people from various counties who were affiliated with the Communists. There were dozens of female prisoners, also mostly convicted of robbery and murder. Among the political prisoners, there was "Miao Min," 26 years old, from Yiyang, the wife of the Communist leader Fang Zhimin. She was a high school graduate. After Fang was captured, Miao still led her troops and fought against the army for more than two years before being captured. She was sentenced to life imprisonment, spared the death penalty. After entering prison, Miao showed remorse and enthusiastically took on the responsibility of writing letters and prison education among the female prisoners, working tirelessly. This shows that capable people, even in prison, still occupy a leadership position. When we saw her, Miao was holding the "Eastern Miscellany" magazine. Miao was tall and very beautiful, wearing a very crisp light purple cheongsam. The six female prisoners in the same cell were all neatly dressed. Fang had three children. At first, they were allowed to accompany their mother in prison, but later permission was denied because the sentence was too long. Other female prisoners had children aged three or four living with them in prison, as there was no way to foster them, so they had to take care of them themselves. Miao has been in prison for three years. If she spends seven years, she may be eligible for the Reflection Regulations and have a chance to see the light of day again.</p>
<p>Nanchang has seven major newspapers and four minor newspapers. After we arrived, one newspaper simultaneously published the crimes of the assassinated Director Cheng Shiwei, doing its best to be harsh. It seemed that someone was deliberately exposing it. On the evening of the news, Zhong and Xiong were taken away by the police, but were released shortly after. We were on a tour, and did not have time to worry about the local grievances. I only felt that using the newspaper as a tool for private attacks and venting anger is a social evil. If there is something to report, it can be brought to court. Those under attack can also file a lawsuit in the civil court. Now, abusing police power to arrest people is also a lack of judgment, and all the methods are wrong. Therefore, what person who has been "fired up" is the most uneconomical.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the group, together with Wei Tingsheng and Zhuan Shi, gave a lecture on finance at the Education Department, which was very exciting. Zhang Shiwei gave a lecture on the test run of vegetable oil cars, which was also of interest to the audience. At Shen Shi (3-5 PM), Chairman Xiong Tianyi invited everyone to a tea party at his residence. Xiong paid great attention to "vocational education" and had already asked Huang Renzhi to jointly draft a plan. He is currently soliciting vocational education methods from Germany for implementation. As for the "Recent Overview of Jiangxi Administration" published by Xiong, it was something he said to his colleagues on the first day. Fearing that the records would be inconsistent, he revised a draft and had it mimeographed and distributed. All the information can be cross-referenced in the "Jiangxi Yearbook of the 25th Year." The colleagues were satisfied with Jiangxi's post-bandit recovery and other construction, especially the popularity of youth education, which is worthy of praise. Xiong and Gong Xuesui, Director of the Construction Department, and Wang Cifu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, did not talk about officialdom but only did practical work, implementing various measures persistently. Although some people say that it has not fully conformed to the party's guiding principles, it is still overly harsh because it is good to see those who are constant after the chaos of Jiangxi soldiers.</p>
<p>Day 8 (April 12th): We departed from Nanchang to Xishan Wanshou Palace. The palace is dedicated to Xu Xun of the Jin Dynasty. In the late Qing Dynasty, when various places established hometown associations, it was often difficult for the government to approve them. The Jiangxi merchants in various places used the name of Wanshou Palace, which had been built under imperial order, so the Jiangxi Guildhalls in various places all operated under the name of Wanshou Palace (like the Tianfei Palace in Fujian). This place is the headquarters of Wanshou Palace, with many ancient cypresses, and thousands of people come to the temple from all over the province every year on the first day of August to pay their respects. The place has become a market. During the Communist Party's time in Jiangxi, the people who came to offer incense were not strictly prohibited, which shows the depth of the people of Jiangxi's superstition in Taoism.</p>
<p>At noon, we arrived in Gao'an County, which is divided into two cities, spanning the Jinjiang River. The north city is denser, and the south region is slightly more relaxed. There is an ancient bridge in Gao'an, over 300 feet long, with solid stonework, which shows the scale of the project at that time. Although the Gao'an Normal School has simple facilities, it is rich in educational spirit. The walls of Yucai Elementary School are made of black cement, with bulletin boards. This method can be emulated by all parties. We see bulletin boards posted everywhere, with rotten paper flying, graffiti, and graffiti, like slogans, which hinder the market's customers. There has never been a method of coating the walls with cement and writing with chalk, which is both economical and good-looking. Dongdou in Gao'an is the Yunqiao Gate, commemorating He Jian's army as the first to enter the city.</p>

<h3>Consul Lei Weiting Resident in South Africa Talks About</h3>
<p>Key Points for Developing South African Commerce</p>
<p>According to Shenzhou News Agency, Lei Weiting, the consul resident in South Africa, returned to the country to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and went to various places in the country for inspection. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency specially visited Lei at his residence yesterday to inquire about the recent situation of overseas Chinese affairs and commerce in South Africa. The conversation was very detailed. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Must Unite Effectively</p>
<p>According to Lei, there are about 3,000 overseas Chinese in South Africa, mostly from Guangdong. Most of those who went there in the beginning worked, but now many are engaged in business, mainly grocery stores, clothing stores, and vegetable gardens. In particular, there are more stores selling daily necessities such as canned food and medicinal oil. The first overseas Chinese went to South Africa around 1885. Later, the South African Federal Government promulgated the Gold Act, prohibiting people of color from living and owning property in the gold mining area. According to the harsh regulations repeatedly enacted by South Africa, the target is not the overseas Chinese but the Indians, because there are now a large number of Indians in South Africa. However, the harsh regulations restricting Asians and people of color have involved Chinese people. In the past, during the tenure of Consul-General He Ji, discussions were held with the South African side to establish a gentleman's agreement. At the verge of success, it was unfortunately destroyed by the conspiracy of a few illegal people, which is a pity. Now, the Federal Government has also enacted new regulations on the renting of residences by Asians. In addition to this being handled by the government, what should be noted is that our overseas Chinese must strive for unity among themselves and should not destroy each other, because being in a foreign land is like sharing one life. At the same time, they should pay more attention to cleanliness, hygiene, and the cultivation of all knowledge.</p>
<p>Key Points for Developing the South African Market</p>
<p>As for the future prospects of South African commerce, the future is still bright. Chinese people have opened about 800 stores, and the business is still good. South Africa has ten million people, and there are seven million natives there. The natives still habitually use Chinese goods, but transportation between here and South Africa is inconvenient, and not many domestic goods have been shipped there in the past. In the future, we should find ways to communicate. South Africa does not have much industrial production, and most of the things used are imported from foreign countries, so there is hope for our domestic goods to be sold there. However, what must be noted is: (1) To cater to white people, household items such as carpets should be of high quality, beautiful colors, and prices should not matter, because the white people living in South Africa are all wealthy and like to use high-quality goods. (2) For goods suitable for the general population, attention must be paid to their low prices. If domestic goods can be cheaper than those from other countries, the sales will be wide, otherwise it will be difficult to receive the patronage of most of the natives.</p>
<h3>New US High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Take the Original Ship to the Philippines This Morning. Talks on Philippine Independence Must First Solve the Economy</p>
<p>After the former commissioner of the United States to the Philippines (i.e., the nature of the former governor), Mr. Murphy, returned to the country and was elected governor of Michigan, the government of the country appointed Mr. Paul Vories McNutt to succeed him. Mr. McNutt arrived in Shanghai at 12:15 p.m. yesterday by the Dollar Line's President Hoover. He will take the original ship to the Philippines at 6 a.m. this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Situation Upon Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>The ship docked at Yangshupu No. 11 and No. 12 pontoon. US Ambassador to China Johnson, US Attorney General to China Hillmic, Consul General to Shanghai Goss, and Shanghai Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun's representative Tang Shixuan, and many other Americans and Filipinos living in Shanghai went to the ship to welcome him. After landing, McNutt went to Hillmic's residence to rest and attended Hill's luncheon. He returned to the original ship that night and continued on to the United States at 6 a.m. this morning.</p>
<p>Accompanying Personnel</p>
<p>In addition to his wife and daughter, those traveling with McNutt included Colonel Ross and his wife, McNutt's personal secretary Hyde and his wife, legal adviser Cardin and his wife, administrative assistant Gao and his wife, accountant Du Baishi and his wife, and female secretary Kona Keyes, totaling more than ten people.</p>
<p>Remarks</p>
<p>McNutt told reporters that he had no specific plans for the administration of the Philippines because he had not yet seen the actual situation on the island. Regarding the realization of Philippine independence in 1939, this depends on the results of the negotiations between the joint committee of American and Philippine economic experts on the future economic problems between the United States and the Philippines. After all, political freedom is meaningless if the economy cannot be independent. In short, economic problems must be solved first. The United States always considers the interests of the Philippines and hopes that it can become independent as soon as possible.</p>
<p>McNutt's Brief Biography</p>
<p>McNutt is from Indiana, USA, and is 46 years old. He graduated from Indiana University and initially practiced law. He then served as an assistant professor at the Indiana University School of Law. He then entered the military and rose from captain to colonel. In 1922, he was elected commander of the National Guard Infantry. In 1933, he became the governor of Indiana and also won the right to run for president. McNutt's appointment to the Philippines was welcomed by the people of the Philippines. He had previously met with Philippine President Quezon in Washington to discuss trade issues between the United States and the Philippines.</p>

<h3>News on the British Tramway Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Party and Government Agreed on Two Measures. Mr. Du Yuesheng Will Mediate Today</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, after all the car and machine workers of the British-owned Shanghai Tramway Company in the Public Concession jointly went on strike on the 18th of this month, the problem has not been resolved due to the insistence of both labor and management. The municipal party and government authorities held a discussion meeting at the municipal party headquarters conference room at 10 a.m. yesterday to discuss a solution. The attendees included Wu Kaixian, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Department, Jiang Huaisu, Secretary-General, Zhou Funong, Chief of the Civil Movement Section, Zhang Sheng, Director of the Labor and Peasant Stock, Lu Sachu, Yu Yaoqiu, Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhu Jintao, a staff member of the Third Section. After the meeting, two measures were decided: (1) Persuade the workers to resume work immediately, and the party and government authorities will be responsible for mediating the issue of treatment conditions. (2) The party and government authorities will inform the Shanghai Tramway Company to convene a board of directors immediately and accept the workers' minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Persuade to Resume Work</p>
<p>After the party and government authorities jointly decided on the handling measures, the municipal party department sent Lu Yinchu, Yu Yaoqiu, Yu Xianqing, Zhu Jintao from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Gong Yuting from the General Labor Union to gather Yang Zhaoyu and Yang Bochu, representatives of the ticket sellers, Li Lansheng, representative of the drivers, and Ge Shixin, representative of the machine workers, at the Zhabei Club to persuade them to resume work first. The party and government authorities were responsible for mediating the issue of requirements. In order to comply with the orders of the party and government, the worker representatives fully accepted the decided measures and promised to set off immediately to persuade the workers in various departments to resume work. It is hoped that work can resume tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Visiting Du for Assistance</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock, representatives Yang Zhaoyu, Yang Bochu, Li Lansheng, Ge Shixin, and Yan Yongqing and others presented a letter to Mr. Du Yuesheng at Du's residence in the French Concession, requesting assistance. Du personally received them and promised to take on the mediation.</p>
<p>Mediation in Progress</p>
<p>After the president of the local association, Du Yuesheng, received the workers' request for assistance, he believed that the matter concerned public transportation and should not be delayed, so he first called the company's Chinese agent Hu Ziyu to talk to him yesterday afternoon at 6 o'clock and scheduled to visit the company at 10 o'clock this morning to meet with the persons in charge of the board of directors and conduct mediation.</p>
<p>Minimum Conditions</p>
<p>The workers have now put forward four conditions for resuming work: (1) Drivers who work 25 days a month will receive one day's additional subsidy (totaling two days including the previous two days). (2) Machine workers will receive two days' additional subsidy per month. (3) Half of the wages will be reissued for the strike period at the Jing'an Temple Road and Huishan Road machine factories. (4) Wages will be paid as usual during the strike period, and workers must not be dismissed on any pretext.</p>
<p>Hope to Resume Work</p>
<p>A reporter from Dagong News Agency inquired with the party and government authorities yesterday.</p>
<p>It is learned that after deciding on these measures to handle the tramway strike, on the one hand, personnel were sent to persuade the workers to resume work first, and on the other hand, the Shanghai Tramway Company was notified to convene a board of directors immediately to accept the workers' minimum requirements. Therefore, the strike can be resolved without delay. Inquiring with the workers, they expressed acceptance of the measures decided by the party and government authorities, but the company must first acknowledge the minimum conditions before they can resume work. The issue of conditions is now being mediated by Du Yuesheng. He will consult with the company this morning to find a solution. If the issue of conditions is resolved today, all workers should be able to resume work as usual tomorrow morning, and the trams on all roads in the concession should be able to resume operation.</p>
<p>Company Losses</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday that the company has a total of 109 trolleybuses and 307 trams (locomotives and trailers). Each trolleybus generates approximately 70 yuan in business revenue per day, with approximately 7 yuan in expenses excluding electricity. Each tram generates approximately 110 yuan in revenue per day, with approximately 2 yuan in expenses. The total daily loss amounts to 40,023 yuan. In addition, it must compensate the French Water and Electricity Company 5,000 yuan per day according to the contract. The company's losses are estimated to reach 180,000 yuan after four days of the workers' strike.</p>
<h3>Public Benefit Cotton Mill Labor Dispute Reaches Stalemate</h3>
<p>Workers Refuse to Re-register</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the strike at the Public Benefit Cotton Mill, located at 150 Robison Road in West Shanghai, was called for mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau the day before yesterday. However, due to the absence of the management, no results were achieved. As the eight improved treatment conditions demanded by the workers have not been resolved, a general meeting of all workers was originally scheduled for 1:00 PM yesterday at the exercise field of the Wo Kung Primary School to discuss ways forward and elect representatives to go to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Industry. However, due to rain, it was rescheduled to be held this afternoon. At the same time, the factory re-issued a notice deciding to re-register all workers. All workers, being in the middle of the mediation period, were unwilling to accept the registration and therefore refused it collectively. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has decided to submit the case to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee for arbitration according to the law.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Factory Workers Petitioned Yesterday</h3>
<p>Demanding Factories Fulfill Conditions</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, silk weaving factory workers declared a strike against silk weaving factories that failed to fulfill the Social Affairs Bureau's ruling. These factories include: ⑴ Shanghai Weaving Factory on Kalou Road, ⑵ Zhenye Factory on Bei’er Road, ⑶ Shenyi Factory in Sanyi Lane, Huasheng Road, ⑷ Tianhua Factory on Huade Road, ⑸ Shili Xin Factory on Huade Road, ⑹ Weicheng Factory in Anle Lane, ⑺ Zhengxin Factory on Huade Road, ⑻ Tianxin Factory on Huade Road, and ⑼ Fuli Factory on Huade Road. Workers from the above factories have formed a weaving strike delegation to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, demanding that the factories be ordered to fulfill the Social Affairs Bureau's ruling as soon as possible, with the most important being the actual measurement in meters and a 10% wage increase for universal labor. According to a survey conducted yesterday by the Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Union, the factories that have implemented the actual measurement in meters include Yulun, Guanghua, Weiwen, Xiefeng, Tao Ji, Yuhou, Dao Hua, Hongda, and dozens of others. Those who have universally increased wages by 10% and also actually measured in meters include Hengfeng, Daxin, Hui Xia Sheng Ji, Nanyang, Xiehe, Meili, Yingyu Jinsheng Chengji, Yongye, and a dozen others. In addition, workers at the Damei Silk Factory in West Shanghai resumed work the day before yesterday, and the factory has agreed to pay wages for the day off on the Huanghuagang Memorial Day.</p>
<h3>Hua Nan Company General Manager Chen Bozhuang Assumed Office Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Singapore China National Products Exhibition Hall Established</h3>
<p>Welcoming All Manufacturers to Participate</p>
<p>The Singapore China National Products Exhibition Hall, organized by the China Industrial Overseas Trade Association of this city, has been formally established. A board of directors has been organized, and the following seven companies have been selected as directors: Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, Family Industrial Cooperative, Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Bank of China, and Tianchu MSG Factory. The Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, and Bank of China were mutually elected as standing directors. All participating manufacturers should pay an establishment fee of 300 national currency. The address of the exhibition hall is on the second floor of the Bank of China on Sisi Street, Singapore, which is the center of the bustling city. In addition to displaying various domestic products, the exhibition hall also has experts in charge. Manufacturers can entrust the exhibition hall to promote sales, introduce banks to handle remittance procedures, and obtain various information about Nanyang. It is a good opportunity for domestic manufacturers to develop overseas trade. The Shanghai office is located in the China Industrial Overseas Trade Association in the Mainland Commercial Building, telephone number 94749. Manufacturers who have not participated are welcome to contact and participate. After the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group from our country went to Nanyang, overseas Chinese and foreign businessmen in various parts of Nanyang have a considerable understanding of domestic goods and hold sincere hopes. It is a pity that there is no overall mobilizing agency, so there is no way to develop. Now that the Singapore Exhibition Hall has been established, it will not be difficult to promote domestic goods in Nanyang in the future.</p>

<h3>Local Association Requests That Gaoqiao Be a Self-Government Experiment Zone</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng's Letter to Acting Mayor Yu</p>
<p>Du Yong, the president of the Local Association of this city, wrote to Acting Mayor Yu to request the takeover of the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association in Pudong and the trial implementation of a local self-government experimental zone. The letter stated, "Respected Sir, Our association founded the Rural Improvement Association in Gaoqiao, Pudong in July of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, and the plan was divided into four main categories: village governance, education, production, and security. Experts and enthusiastic local individuals were invited to be members, responsible for planning everything. The required funds were raised by Yong and others, and the term was set for three years, after which it would be handed over to the local government for takeover. At the beginning of the establishment, a letter was sent to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government for the record. Fortunately, with the guidance of the party and government organs, we have been able to implement it step by step according to the original plan, such as repairing roads and building bridges, spending more than 10,000 yuan, all donated by enthusiastic local individuals. Group weddings have been held twice, with nearly 1,000 spectators each time. Three primary schools have been run independently, assisting the government in carrying out literacy education campaigns, civic training, labor service, and anti-smoking propaganda. Using the four seasons, public entertainment was held and a production mutual aid society was established. More than 10,000 yuan has been lent out, and all have been recovered on time, ensuring credibility. Recently, more than 30 cooperatives have been organized, and the Bank of China has been requested to lend 10,000 yuan. Two nurseries have been set up for year-round care, and temporary ones have also been set up twice during the busy farming season, accommodating more than 200 children. Improved seeds are used and side businesses are promoted. In a small-scale experiment, sanitation work is completely carried out in cooperation with the health office, and it has already taken shape and achieved initial results. Considerable connections have been made with local leaders, ambitious young people, and enthusiastic comrades abroad. As of June of this year, the three-year term has expired, and a total of more than 20,000 yuan has been spent. We want to continue, but we are suffering from exhausted finances. Transferring it to the local government is also feared to be beyond our capabilities. I have heard that the mayor has announced the policy of selecting a suitable location for a self-government experimental zone and gradually promoting it to the entire city. I am extremely admired. I am using this opportunity to inform you of the Gaoqiao Improvement Association that our association has established. I hope that you will send someone to investigate and approve the takeover, so that the three years of management of our association will not be in danger of being abandoned, and the germination of self-government in Gaoqiao can advance to the city of prosperity. If you have any questions, please let me know immediately. The Director-General, Mr. Wang Kuizheng, can be received to present everything in person. I am extremely grateful and await your approval for compliance."</p>

<h3>Twenty-one Christian Organizations Held a Farewell Reception for Ambassador Gan</h3>
<p>Held at the YMCA the Night Before Last</p>
<p>The National Christian Council of China, the National Association of YMCAs, the Chinese Bible Society, the YWCA, the Chinese Christian Education Association, the East China Christian Education Association, the Guangju Association, the Shanghai YMCA, the Shanghai YWCA, the Shanghai Branch of the International YWCA, St. John's University, the Women's Temperance Union, the Shanghai Missionary Association, the Shanghai Christian Federation, the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, the Christian Pui Society, the Ten-Man Corps for National Salvation through Christian Faith and Action in China, the American Church in Shanghai, Shanghai University, the Gospel Broadcasting Station, and the Chinese Women's Medical College, a total of twenty-one organizations, originally scheduled to hold a banquet at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA on the evening of the 16th of this month to bid farewell to Dr. Wang Rutang, who is going to the United States to take office. However, because Dr. Wang was on official business in Hangzhou and could not rush back, the public banquet was canceled and changed to a tea party at the YMCA on Yuanmingyuan Road at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. In addition to Mr. and Mrs. Wang, more than 50 representatives from various organizations were present. First, Chairman Dr. Chen Wenyuan gave a speech and presented Dr. Wang with a Bible and a hymn book on behalf of the organizations. Then, Ms. Sun Wang Guoxiu, the president of the YWCA, gave a farewell speech, stating that today's women's movement in China is making progress day by day. She hoped that Dr. Wang and his wife would be able to convey this to the American women's community and promote friendship between China and the United States. Next, Mr. Bao Yindeng, the representative of the National Christian Council, gave a farewell speech, saying that he and Wang had worked together at the National Association of YMCAs 26 years ago and admired his ability to handle affairs very much. Wang has also spared no effort in promoting international friendship and world peace and is a leader among Christians. Finally, the various organizations asked Wang to give some parting words for them to follow. Wang Rutang said that he was extremely grateful for everyone's sincerity and kindness, but due to time and his throat, he could not say much. He would just like to mention what he has felt in the past 30 years: ⑴ Most Chinese Christians now have a clearer understanding of their responsibility to the church. In the past, they relied solely on others, so those who believed in religion were called "eating the church." Now, they are willing to contribute their own money to run various charitable causes, such as hospitals, schools, and churches. The future is very promising. ⑵ Since most Christians know their own responsibility, it is hoped that all parties will cultivate them so that their ability can be improved and their responsibility can be increased. ⑶ Chinese and foreign Christians can cooperate and carry out various undertakings and promote them. This is not only related to the development of church undertakings but also has a great relationship with enhancing international friendship. Finally, he said that in addition to serving the country and promoting international friendship, he would also do his best for world peace. If there were any shortcomings, he hoped that everyone would give assistance and pray for him. The party broke up at 6:15 PM.</p>

<h3>Urgent Telegram from the Guizhou Branch of the China International Famine Relief Commission</h3>
<p>Begging for Relief for Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Guizhou Province has been suffering from drought since last autumn, and the lack of rainfall has led to withered crops and panic among the people. People are fighting over fern roots and tree bark for food, and incidents of grain robbery are frequent. The Guizhou Branch of the China International Famine Relief Commission cannot bear to stand idly by and appeals to all parties for relief. It also telegraphed the General Commission at No. 505 Henan Road in this city, urging them to promote fundraising and provide assistance to save the disaster-stricken people. It is planned to submit the situation to the Executive Committee for discussion and decision-making, and then provide assistance and relief. The original telegram is transcribed below:</p>
<p>To the esteemed General Commission, Guizhou is an impoverished region where agricultural production is always difficult to sustain. In recent years, natural disasters and banditry have occurred one after another, severely damaging the vitality of society, leading to the decline of rural areas and a decrease in agricultural production. The future of the people's food supply is already causing panic. Furthermore, last year's severe drought affected more than 40 counties, with average harvests falling below 40%. Although the central government successively allocated more than 300,000 yuan in relief funds and the provincial government managed to raise tens of thousands of yuan to carry out county-level relief, it was like a drop in the bucket, unable to alleviate the massive disaster. There was hope for a good harvest this spring to regulate the people's food supply after April and before the autumn harvest. Therefore, from the government to the people, everyone advocated planting more buckwheat to prevent famine. Unexpectedly, the autumn drought was followed by a spring drought. For several months, there has been no heavy rain. Recently, the drought has become even more severe, with water sources drying up, fields cracking, crops withering, and food supplies becoming scarce. There is also concern about a shortage of drinking water. The previous hope for a spring harvest to barely sustain life has now become a pipe dream. Moreover, the food supply in the disaster area is almost entirely depleted. Even if heavy rain falls immediately, it will not affect the eastern planting, and the immediate food shortage is difficult to overcome. If rescue is not carried out quickly, the tragic scene of corpses strewn everywhere in 1925 will be repeated in the future. Recently, the scramble for fern roots and tree bark, and the trend of grain robbery, are just the beginning of the disaster. The current widespread phenomenon is that rice prices are soaring daily, making it difficult for even the wealthy to take care of themselves, let alone the poor. People with gaunt faces and tearful, hungry cries are almost everywhere. The government feels that providing relief is difficult, and the people are afraid of dying every day. We cannot bear to witness this suffering and are launching a fundraising campaign out of compassion for disaster relief. However, the disaster area is vast, making it difficult to provide universal relief. We believe that your commission is the savior of disaster victims in our country, admired both at home and abroad. The people of Guizhou in the past have especially felt your deep benevolence. In addition to appealing to the central government to quickly allocate funds for relief, we are sending this telegram to report the disaster situation, urging you to provide assistance and widely promote fundraising, so that the wailing and desperate people can have a better chance of survival. This urgent telegram conveys our utmost anticipation. Respectfully submitted by Lan Shiqian, Chairman of the Guizhou Branch, and all directors.</p>
<h3>Possession of an Unlicensed Handgun Results in a Fine of 300 Yuan</h3>
<p>During the labor strike that occurred at the New Yu No. 2 Cotton Mill on Lubo Sheng Road last month, a foreman publicly intimidated workers with a handgun provided by the factory. As a result, the handgun was seized by the workers, and a shot was fired, fortunately without injuring anyone. Afterward, the handgun was handed over by the labor side to the Garrison Headquarters, which then transferred it to the Wutuo Road Police Station. It was discovered that this .32 caliber handgun, along with six bullets, had not been registered with the Bureau of Public Works. Therefore, in accordance with Article 186 of the Criminal Code, the First Special Court filed a public prosecution against Zeng Xiangxi, the manager of the New Yu No. 1 Cotton Mill, who was a native of Sichuan. He had been summoned once before, but the defendant did not appear, and the hearing was rescheduled. Details of this case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the rescheduled hearing took place. The defendant, Zeng Xiangxi, appeared with his lawyer. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented the previous circumstances. According to the defendant's statement, No. 8 Lubo Sheng Road was originally the Puyi Cotton Mill. A month ago, it was taken over by the company and renamed the New Yu No. 2 Cotton Mill. There were originally two handguns, both of which had been registered and transferred to the factory. However, one of the handguns was damaged and could not be used. Therefore, this handgun was used as a replacement to be issued to the gate guards for defense purposes. Before the incident, an application had been submitted to the Bureau of Public Works to issue a license. On July 25th, a labor strike suddenly broke out in the factory, and the workers rushed into the office and destroyed equipment. The handgun was placed on the desk and was taken away by the workers. After hearing arguments from both sides, the presiding judge ruled that Zeng Xiangxi possessed military firearms and ammunition without permission and imposed a fine of 300 yuan. If he could not pay the fine, he would be sentenced to labor service, with three yuan equivalent to one day of labor. The handgun and six bullets were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants Telegraph Railway Department to Clear Congestion at Bengbu</h3>
<p>Cargo transportation at Bengbu Station has been experiencing difficulties due to prolonged delays in the dispatch of vehicles, causing hardship for merchants. It is reported that the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association telegraphed the Railway Department yesterday, urging them to find a way to clear the congestion. The original telegram reads: "To Minister Zhang of the Nanjing-Dong Railway Department: For more than a month, Bengbu has been experiencing a shortage of vehicles, and cargo is piling up like a mountain. The new grain and goods purchased and transported by our industry are experiencing sluggish sales and significant losses. Moreover, the wet season is approaching, and spoilage is a concern. We urgently telegraph your department to instruct the Jinpu Railway Administration to find a way to increase the number of vehicles and clear the accumulated cargo to facilitate transportation and alleviate the merchants' difficulties. This is extremely urgent." Respectfully, Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Trade Association.</p>
<h3>"Power Life" Drug Found to Contain No Aphrodisiac Ingredients</h3>
<p>Police File Fraud Charges Separately</p>
<p>Yonghua Pharmacy, located at No. 512 Tianjin Road, previously published advertisements for a drug called "Power Life," claiming that the drug could treat nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. In fact, it was said to contain aphrodisiac ingredients, which was discovered by the Zhabei Police Station. The sale of aphrodisiacs is strictly prohibited by law, so they went to confiscate a large quantity of "Power Life." After testing by the Public Health Department of the Bureau of Public Works, it was found that the drug did not contain any aphrodisiac ingredients. The police, believing that since the drug was not an aphrodisiac, the pharmacy was deceiving others, filed a public prosecution against Luo Huaji, the owner of the pharmacy, for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code. The case was heard yesterday morning by Judge Pan Zhenyang of the First Special Court in Criminal Division Two. The defendant, Luo Huaji, did not appear. After the lawyer Zhang Shizhu presented the case, he requested that the hearing be rescheduled. Judge Pan ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for one week.</p>

<h3>Wet Nurse Abducts Child</h3>
<p>Missing for Almost Two Weeks</p>
<p>At No. 208, Huakang Road, at the intersection of Gonghe Road in Zhabei, the Ji family, who works for the Bureau of Public Works in the Public Concession, has a fifteen-month-old son named Ji Genfu. The wet nurse, Shen Chen, 27 years old, from Jiangsu, suddenly took the child away on the morning of the 4th of this month. It has been almost two weeks, and their whereabouts are still unknown. It is reported that the wet nurse has a lover named Zhang Guisheng, who is a tailor at No. 8 Heyu Lane, across from their house. He is also missing, which is highly suspicious of conspiracy.

<h3>Merchant Liu Yuanzhao Collapses and Falsely Claims Poisoning</h3>

<p>Liu Yuanzhao, a 52-year-old merchant from Jiangxi, residing at No. 111 Zaifeng Road, left his house at 2:00 PM on the 19th. He went to the Juxiao Small Hotel at No. 192 Mintini Yin Road in the French Concession with a woman surnamed Zhang, using the alias Yang Deming, 49 years old, from Hunan, and booked Room 2 for illicit relations. Unexpectedly, pleasure turned to sorrow as Liu collapsed. The woman fled. At 4:30 PM, a tea boy discovered Liu and sent him to Renji Hospital, falsely claiming that he had been poisoned. Liu died after unsuccessful treatment. The hospital reported the matter to the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. The Special Second Court was requested to send personnel to verify the cause of death. Since there were no family members present, the funeral home was instructed to take custody of the body. Liu's family, who had been searching for Liu for three days without success, finally inquired at the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home and found his body. Yesterday, Liu's wife, Liu Zhong, requested the Special Second Court Procuratorate to claim the body.

<h3>Postal Bureau Laborer Sues for 10,800 Yuan in Damages for Injured Foot</h3>
<p>Xie Jinwen Files Private Prosecution; Foreign Director-General Zhapi Lin Named as Defendant</p>
<p>Xie Jinwen, a 31-year-old native of Anhui residing at No. 39 Shunyuwei, Yangshupu, used to work as a laborer at the Shanghai Postal Bureau. On November 3rd of last year, after getting off work at 6:00 PM, he and ten companions took Postal Bureau Truck No. 3 home. The truck was driven by driver Li Guifang. The truck stopped at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund. Eight people who were in the same truck with Xie got off first. Xie was the second to last to get off the truck. At that time, the truck had already started moving, causing Xie to lose his balance and fall, and his left foot was run over by the truck wheels. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by the French Police and has not fully recovered after more than four months. He is currently receiving treatment at the Puai Hospital. Xie, due to the injury to his foot, is not only unable to recover in the short term but will also be disabled in the future and unable to make a living. Therefore, he hired attorney Wu Peng to file a private prosecution in the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court against truck driver Li Guifang and the foreign Director-General of the Postal Bureau, Zhapi Lin (transliteration), for negligent injury, requesting that they be prosecuted according to law and seeking damages of 10,800 yuan (calculated at one yuan per day for thirty years until the age of sixty). The court accepted the case and, yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huanhu presided over the hearing in Criminal Division Two. The plaintiff was examined by the acting lawyer, who stated the plaintiff's intentions. Only the defendant, Li Guifang, appeared with his defense attorney. The small workers who were in the same truck at the time of the accident were also invited to the court to testify. After the court questioned both parties about the facts, it decided that the case still needed to be investigated and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Fourteen Toyoda Mill Workers Sentenced to One Year and Two Months Each</h3>
<p>Second Batch of Arrested Individuals Also Tried; Chen Zhixiang's Sentencing Set for the 24th</p>
<p>After the Toyoda Mill worker representative Sun Qiantai was stabbed, suspects were arrested, and the Caojiadu Sub-Bureau was requested to handle the case. The sub-bureau was destroyed, and the sub-bureau chief Tan Baoshou was injured. The Municipal Police Bureau Garrison Team arrested sixteen workers, including Jiang Asi, Zhou Lianchang, Yang Yuantian, Wu Jinsheng, Liu Chunqi, Yu Geda, Chen Chunsheng, Zhang Wenyuan, Zhang Asan, Wang Asan, Chen Chunguo, Hu Shouhou, Gan Songlin, Qin Qiaosheng, Qu Hongfa, and Yang Ar Er, and transferred them to the District Court. The prosecutor initially requested the release of the defendants at the request of the General Labor Union but subsequently filed a public prosecution. After three interrogations by the Criminal Division, Qu Hongfa and Yang Ar Er evaded and did not appear. At the final closing arguments, the judge ordered the fourteen defendants to pay a bail of 300 yuan each. At that time, due to insufficient bail, they were all detained. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dong Ling opened the court and brought the fourteen detained defendants to the case, announcing the verdict. The defendants were sentenced to one year and two months in prison each for gathering a crowd to obstruct official duties, injure people, and damage property. All the defendants declared that they were dissatisfied and requested bail during the appeal period. The judge ruled that the previous bail bond had expired and that if they wanted bail, they had to pay a substantial bail and provide a business guarantor to the court for review to determine if they had the financial capacity to provide the guarantee before a decision could be made. They were ordered to be returned to custody. In addition, Xu Chengli, Zhou Tonghe, and the female workers Qu Guixiang and Zhou Ajin, who were recently arrested by the Public Security Bureau as part of the second batch of individuals who echoed and disturbed the peace, were also tried yesterday afternoon. The defendants all denied the charges. The court scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the 24th. Xu and Zhou were ordered to find a suitable guarantor, and the female workers were returned to their original guarantors. Chen Zhixiang, the main offender in the stabbing of Sun Qiantai, was also tried yesterday afternoon. According to the prosecutor's argument, "Chen stabbed Sun out of resentment because he did not receive any monetary reward after initially helping Sun establish the union." The court also scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the 24th and ordered Chen to be returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Sun Meitang Accused of Embezzlement, Court Does Not Accept the Case</h3>
<p>Because the Plaintiff Has No Right to Sue Privately</p>
<p>Sun Meitang, the owner of the Meihuali Watch and Clock Shop on Nanjing Road, was recently sued in the First Special Court for embezzlement by Zhu Zhenkang and Wang Lingfu, who hired lawyers. The case concerns Sun Meitang, who is a managing director of the Ning Shao Shipping Company, allegedly embezzling 109,933.54 yuan and 45,462.37 yuan in the name of the Meihuali Head Office of the Yingxi Zhenda Silver Company in 1935. The First Special Court has already interrogated him once. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing in Criminal Division Eight. The defendant, Sun Meitang, appeared with his defense attorneys Liu Chunlu and Lu Jun. The plaintiffs, Zhu Zhenkang and Wang Lingfu, complained of the defendant's embezzlement, claiming that they were both shareholders of the Ning Shao Company, each holding 25 yuan in shares. The witness, Zhu Meiguang, testified that he was the general manager of the Ning Shao Shipping Company. The company's capital was 1.5 million yuan, and the chairman of the board was Yu Zuoting. The defendant was formerly the managing director of the company and the owner of the Meihuali Head Office, and there were dealings with the company. The defendant does owe the company more than 100,000 yuan, but according to the market price, interest is charged at 8.5% per month, and it has been approved by the company's shareholders' meeting. Judge Huang ruled that the Ning Shao Company is a limited liability company and has the status of a legal person. The plaintiffs have no right to file a private prosecution, so the case was not accepted.</p>

Wang Daoyuan confessed that Cai Xu (aka Aying) acted as a lookout, while Zhang Xiaokui and Zhang Yongxiang (both at large) initiated the plan, colluding with Li Dacheng (at large), Wang Da (at large), and the defendants and Li Wancai and Chen Ganquan to commit the robbery. Cai Xu also went to the Zhang's house when they robbed Zhang's family. Gu Shihua exchanged the stolen goods from Zhou's house for money, which was divided into sixteen shares, each receiving 34 yuan. The court questioned each defendant once. It was decided to reschedule the hearing to 2:00 PM on May 5th. The defendants were returned to custody. After the hearing, Wang Daoyuan stated that he had been detained in the British Concession for three weeks and was not given enough food. The air in the detention center in the French Concession was insufficient, and people were getting sick. He requested that he be transferred to the detention center.

<h3>Conflicting Testimonies in Du Wu's Wife-Killing Case</h3>
<p>Wife Says Husband Consorted with Bad People; Husband Says Wife Committed Adultery and Hid a Knife</p>
<p>Du Wenkui from Huaian, Jiangbei (also known as Du Wu, currently 38 years old), and his legal wife, Ms. Li (currently 35 years old), due to her licentious nature, according to Du, had an affair with Zhou Guangfa, a man from Shandong, in Nanjing last winter. Du caught them in the act and decided to</p>
<p>Move to a Better Place. The family moved to a thatched hut on Jinling Road, Zhabei, in this city. However, Zhou also came to Shanghai to continue the affair and engaged in behavior detrimental to the husband. Du claims to have found a small knife by his pillow. Therefore, Du, along with his older brother Du Wenli (also known as Du Si), his younger brother Du Wenhua (also known as Du Liu), and Xu Qingsi, Wenhua's brother-in-law, used sharp knives at Moling Lane, Jinling Road, to stab Ms. Li's head, arms, and other areas over a dozen times.</p>
<p>Ms. Li cried out for help. Fearing arrest, Du and the others fled in a panic. Neighbors rushed Ms. Li to Renji Hospital for treatment. After forty-one days, her life was saved, but she was blinded in one eye. Du Si and Du Liu were arrested by the police and taken to the local court. After investigation, the court found that Du Wu had fled to Xiaguan in Nanjing. The chief prosecutor of the court sent a confidential letter to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, ordering the detective team to rush to Xiaguan and arrest Du Wu, who was then transferred to the local court. Du claimed</p>
<p>He had no intention of fleeing out of fear of punishment. He said that after his brothers were arrested, he wrote to his father-in-law, asking him to hire a lawyer, which is why he was arrested in Nanjing. The prosecutor was clear that the Du brothers had committed murder and jointly filed charges against them, including the fugitive Xu Qingsi. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zongxing opened the court for trial. Ms. Li Du testified that she was 35 years old, from Huaian, living in a thatched hut on Jinling Road, Zhabei. She had been married to her husband, Du Wenkui, for twelve years and had no children. They married in 1925. In 1927, they went to Nanjing, and in 1928, Du took a concubine, Ms. Chen, in their hometown. Subsequently, Du and Chen engaged in</p>
<p>A lawsuit for assault. From then on, her husband abandoned her. She had no choice but to make a living by peddling with her father. Du now has a woman on Maigen Road, but she has not seen her. Last year, he was arrested by the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters for theft. She received a letter telling her so. She asked her father to visit him in Nanjing, and he was released. Ten days later, a friend from Shanghai, Xu Jingeng, also known as Xiao Yangzhou, wrote to her, asking her husband to go to Shanghai. She also came to Shanghai. On January 12th, she saw that her husband was not working all day and was associating with bad people, so she advised him to return to the right path and cursed his bad friend Xu Jingeng. On January 19th, he was so ashamed that he falsely invited her to drink alcohol in order to carry out his plan. Halfway there, Xu grabbed her, and her husband</p>
<p>Stabbed me with a knife. Her uncle and younger siblings had been lying in wait and guarding the area. Ms. Li's father, Du Shan, testified that he was 72 years old and lived at 841 Daqing Lane, Roberts Road. Ms. Li Du was his daughter. His son-in-law was arrested last year for theft, and his daughter scolded him every day, leading to enmity. Du Wenkui testified that he was 38 years old and worked as a dockworker. Because his wife wanted to conspire with her lover to harm him, he stole her</p>
<p>Lover's knife to deal with her. He said he acted on Xinmin Road. The first time he discovered her adultery was in Nanjing. To save face, he moved to Shanghai, but she followed him. He was always on the lookout and felt a small knife on the pillow by the bed, so he was angry and wanted to kill her. He asked for leniency. When Du Wenli and Du Wenhua were questioned, they flatly denied any involvement, saying that Ms. Li was plotting to implicate the entire Du family and wept, pleading for investigation. The court adjourned for further investigation, and the defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Wu Wenjuan Sues for Divorce Due to Husband's Prior Adultery</h3>
<p>Gu Wenbao's Fall: Awaiting File and Public Notice</p>
<p>Wu Wenjuan, a young woman from Beiping, is currently 32 years old. Although past her youthful years, she is still stunningly beautiful. At the age of seventeen, she was married to Gu Wenbao, a merchant from the same area, by her parents. At the beginning of their marriage, their relationship was excellent. A year later, they had a son named Baobao, who is now twelve years old. Later, Gu became addicted to pleasure and immersed himself in brothels, working as a scribe at night, lacking energy, and also falling into the habit of opium, losing his job and staying idle. The family finances declined, and they could not afford to live. Therefore, Wu Wenjuan was introduced by her uncle to the Huacheng Tobacco Company as an employee, earning more than twenty yuan a month to support the family and pay for her child's tuition. Gu, on the other hand, stayed at home, leading a boring life. This lasted for about seven years. In 1933, Wu Wenjuan was unfortunately dismissed by the factory, and the couple were both unemployed. They lived in fear and pawned their belongings to make a living. Eventually, they ran out of things to pawn and were reduced to poverty. They discussed that rather than starve to death, they should take a risky and shameful path. Wenjuan was still in her prime and beautiful, so they decided that she would sell herself. Wu Wenjuan became a "waiter" at the Fuxiangli brothel, serving wine when the lights came on. She met a sympathetic customer. The small house was rented. Gu Wenbao, fearing that it would be taken away by others, in desperation, went to the police station to accuse her of adultery. The illicit lovers were taken to court, where the First Special Court ruled that because Gu Wenbao had been an adulterer before, Wu Wenjuan and her lover were acquitted according to law. Therefore, Wu Wenjuan filed a petition with the Nanshi Local Court, requesting a divorce from her husband so she could be free. She also stated that she did not know where her husband was. Yesterday, Judge Yu interrogated her to find out whether Gu Wenbao had indeed done as described above and what the court's criminal verdict was. The file and public notice to the defendant are awaited so an investigation and decision can be made. The case has been adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Detective's Use of Torture to Obtain Confession for Assault and Other Crimes</h3>
<p>He Wenjin and Others Indicted; Civil Suit Filed for Compensation</p>
<p>On February 9th of this year, over fifty bags of wheat were stolen from the Shen Da Flour Mill. The guard, Lu Tianfa, suspected Wan Ruxi and Wan Xiaochengzi of the theft and reported it to the Municipal Police Bureau, which sent detectives He Wenjin and Gu Junqing from the Ximen Branch to bring Wan and the others to the station. He Wenjin and Gu Junqing, because they refused to confess, tied Wan Ruxi's hands and tortured him, causing injuries. Lawyer Xue Lisheng filed a lawsuit with the local court, requesting justice and upholding human rights. Prosecutor Yang Ruxiu investigated the case and found that Wan and the others were not only innocent but also wrongfully imprisoned and immediately released them. A forensic doctor was also ordered to examine Wan and confirmed that he was indeed injured. The prosecutor summoned detectives He Wenjin and Gu Junqing to court for investigation. They both denied the facts, saying that Wan and the others had fabricated the injuries and falsely accused them. Lawyer Xue continued to submit evidence, stating that Wan and the others were in custody and had been escorted to the court. A court inspection was immediately conducted and if the injuries were fake, the police guards must have helped to inflict them. Therefore, their claim was a complete cover-up. The prosecutor indicted detectives He Wenjin and Gu Junqing for violating Article 302, Paragraph 1, and Article 277, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law, for obstructing freedom and assault, and requested the criminal court to impose a severe sentence for the most serious crime. The trial is scheduled to be held publicly by the criminal court today. Lawyer Xue will appear in court on behalf of the victim to pursue the case and file a civil suit for compensation for wrongful imprisonment and medical expenses.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank Annual Report for the 25th Year (Continued)</h3>
<p>II. Stability of the Currency System: Apart from the rise in commodity prices, the most important economic events of the year were the stability of the currency system and the bumper harvest, which were also the main factors contributing to the rise in commodity prices. Since the currency system reform in early October of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the exchange rate has remained stable at around the average rate of the past five years. Although it has been repeatedly attacked by speculators during times of tense Sino-Japanese relations, it has not been significantly affected. Only when the value of the French franc was extremely unstable in the autumn was the range of changes in China's foreign exchange rate slightly expanded to cope with the drastic changes in British and American exchange rates. Since France officially abandoned the gold standard, it has returned to stability. This kind of stable achievement was unexpected by most people and is sufficient to prove that the stable exchange rate at that time could indeed conform to the national conditions. Since the currency system reform, foreign trade has obviously improved. This year's import trade was over 94.41 million yuan, an increase of over 22.2 million yuan compared with the 24th year; export trade was over 70.5 million yuan, an increase of over 13 million yuan compared with the 24th year. The trade deficit was over 23.5 million yuan, a decrease of over 10.7 million yuan compared with the 24th year. This is because the exchange rate was lowered and remained stable, so the increase in export trade was far greater than that of import trade. This trade deficit figure cannot be taken as reliable history due to the rampant smuggling in North China. However, if the currency system were not reformed, the trade deficit would undoubtedly be even greater than this number. Moreover, since the exchange rate stabilized, remittances from overseas Chinese have also been more abundant than in previous years, which may be enough to offset the expenditure of smuggling and have a surplus. Therefore, it is very possible that this year's international balance of payments will turn into a surplus, which will be of great help to the stability of the currency system. Since the foreign exchange rate has been reduced by 20% at the time of the currency system reform, domestic commodity prices have also risen successively during this year, which also has a causal relationship.</p>
<p>III. Bumper Harvest: However, the appropriate foreign exchange rate is a major reason for the improvement of the international balance of payments, and another major reason is the bumper harvest this year. Even the rise in prices is closely related to the harvest. In the past, China imported a large amount of rice, grain, and cotton. This year, due to the bumper harvest, the import of commodities such as rice and cotton has been greatly reduced. The import of rice and grain this year was about 27 million yuan, while the import in the 24th year reached more than 89.5 million yuan, a decrease of about 63 million yuan. The import of wheat this year was over 11.8 million yuan, while the import in the 24th year reached over 34.8 million yuan, a decrease of about 23 million yuan. The import of cotton this year was over 36 million yuan, while in the 24th year it was over 41 million yuan, a decrease of about 9 million yuan. The total reduction in imports for the three items reached 90 million yuan. On the other hand, the important commodities whose exports increased due to the domestic bumper harvest included cotton, which was over 21.1 million yuan in the 24th year and over 28.8 million yuan this year, an increase of over 6.4 million yuan. Rice and wheat were about 1 million yuan in the 24th year and increased to about 5 million yuan this year, an increase of 4 million yuan. In terms of these three items alone, the increase in exports reached over 10 million yuan. If we add up the decrease in imports and the increase in exports, we get over 100 million yuan, which is consistent with the decrease in the trade deficit. Therefore, it is almost impossible to deny that the decrease in the trade deficit is due to the bumper harvest of China's main agricultural products. Moreover, when the agricultural products were abundant, it happened that overseas grain prices rose, and the exchange rate also fell. The coffers were full, so the prices were able to maintain a considerable level, and the story of "cheap grain hurting farmers" did not occur. Therefore, the purchasing power of rural areas has increased significantly. The sales and prices of daily necessities such as cotton yarn and cotton cloth have increased, and the price index has begun to rise significantly since the second half of this year. If it were not for the bumper harvest, how could this be achieved? From this, it can be seen that although the improvement of China's economic situation this year is due to the stability of the currency system, the unification of the political situation, and the rebound of commodity prices, the importance of the bumper harvest is actually higher than any other factor.</p>
<p>According to estimates from various sources, the degree of this year's bumper harvest is the highest for cotton. The lowest estimate of this year's output is about 14 million dan, an increase of more than 70% compared to last year, which is an unprecedented record. The second is soybeans, with 126 million city dan, and peanuts with 55 million city dan, both of which increased by more than 30% compared with the 24th year. The third is sesame, with over 17 million city dan, and sorghum with over 150 million city dan, both of which increased by 10% to 15% compared with the 24th year. The estimated harvest of rice is 1 billion city dan, an increase of about 4% compared with the 24th year. The estimated harvest of wheat is 46 million city dan, an increase of 8% compared with the 24th year. In addition, the output of minor crops such as barley, corn, and tobacco has also increased. In terms of various provinces, Shandong, Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan have benefited the most. Shandong cotton and peanuts, Anhui rice, wheat, soybeans, and cotton, Hubei cotton, wheat, and soybeans, and Hunan rice and cotton have all had particularly abundant harvests. Therefore, the increase in the purchasing power of the people in these provinces is significant. The second is Hebei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Henan, and Shanxi provinces. As for Shaanxi, except for the bumper harvest of cotton, the food crops were mostly poor, and the local food supply became a problem, resulting in a large number of flour being transported to the province in the latter half of this year. In Zhejiang, minor crops such as soybeans, rapeseed, and broad beans have also had good harvests, which can be said to be an exception to the abundant year.</p>
<p>IV. Financial Stability: Due to the bumper harvest and the stability of the currency system, the financial situation is much more stable than in the past. The issuance of legal tender has increased rapidly due to the gradual withdrawal of the use of cash. The total amount at the end of the year was 110 million yuan, with sufficient reserves and increasing credit. The number of bank and money shop closures has decreased significantly, and the difficulties in operation are much less than in the past. However, most bankers have felt the impact of the financial panic and have had to rectify their past shortcomings, and they have not been able to rapidly develop their financial affairs. Not many new banks and money shops have been opened. As industry and commerce have gradually recovered, bank and money shop deposits have increased significantly, and the capital market has tended to be loose. In terms of Shanghai interbank interest rates, they are usually around 8%, with very few special changes. Looking at the future, there is a tendency towards a low interest rate pattern. At the same time, the capital turnover rate is also faster than in the past. This year's Shanghai clearing volume, calculated for both banks and money shops, has increased by about one-half compared with previous years. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Overview of the Physics Department Exhibition</h3>
<p>Our department was founded in the 2nd year of the Republic of China and has reached its 24th year. Those in charge were Dr. Xiong Xuanxue, Professors Zhu and Zhang. Recently, Professor Xu Jinghan and Dr. Li Qingxian have succeeded each other and actively planned, and the department's affairs are thriving. The exhibition program for this year is as follows:</p>
<p>(I) Radio Engineering Group: Radio is an emerging science, and its application is vast and its progress is rapid, which cannot be compared with any other science. Even the radios sold on the market are changing with each passing day, making people dizzy. But in fact, they cannot escape a few basic principles and circuits. This group displays various basic structures, including transceivers, transmitters, long waves, and ultra-short waves.</p>
<p>(II) Mathematics Group: Mathematics is the backbone of all sciences and occupies a leading position. Often there are mysterious formulas that people know but cannot apply. After hundreds of years, they find that they can match a certain science, and thereby open up a new path. So mathematics can also be said to be the source of science, and we naturally have something to exhibit. However, what can mathematics display? Formulas and theories are all in the minds of mathematicians, and it is impossible to peek into their mysteries for a while. We can only display the tools used in mathematics, such as models of solids and curved surfaces, and various wonderful diagrams for people to appreciate.</p>
<p>(III) General Physics Group: This group displays various simple and important teaching experiments in general physics to make beginners more thorough in learning theory and to arouse the interest of those who have not learned.</p>
<p>(IV) Mechanics Group: Physics takes mechanics as its starting point, and its principles are the most basic. We have specially displayed various instruments for measuring weights and measures, instruments for measuring physical properties, and experiments on statics and dynamics in turn.</p>
<p>(V) Workshop: Because physical instruments have precise structures and are of great value, and they are all foreign goods, they are often damaged. In order to be self-sufficient, we have set up a small workshop. Although this workshop has only a short history, it is already well-equipped, and there are several products. Please visit our tools and our self-made products.</p>
<p>(VI) Optics Group: This group puts optical instruments, such as microscopes and cameras, etc., and various phenomena of light, such as reflection, refraction, and interference, etc. All those that can be displayed in sunlight are arranged separately.</p>
<p>(VII) Thermodynamics Group: This group has a lot of various instruments and experiments on thermodynamics. Even in the item of thermometers alone, there are more than a dozen kinds. There are also many newly improved instruments.</p>
<p>(VIII) Electrical Engineering Group: Everyone knows the greatness of the application of electricity. All daily life, transportation, national defense, and light and heavy industry cannot do without electricity. Therefore, the Electrical Engineering Group is indeed worth visiting. Here are sophisticated measuring instruments, daily necessities, and motors, etc.</p>
<p>(IX) Modern Physics and Optics Group: Physics in the 20th century has entered the stage of studying the interior of matter. The interior of matter cannot be seen with the eyes or touched with the hands. How can it be measured? But physicists have experimental methods to prove it. This group has spectrometers, radioactive pottery, Anke ltJ light, and sou quan jin dao. After you visit, you can probably know what is inside matter? Because this exhibition room is a dark room, there are also wonderful optical phenomena that can only be seen in the dark, which are also displayed here.</p>
<h3>Soochow University Physics Department Radio Experiment Room</h3>
<h3>Overview of the Chemistry Department Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Chemistry Department of Soochow University has a history of more than 20 years. It was initially founded by Dr. Gong from the United States. After the 13th year of the Republic of China, it was successively presided over by Mr. Shen Huiyuan, Mr. Pan Zhenming, and Dr. Gu Yidong. This exhibition is divided into nine rooms, which are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>First Physical Chemistry Exhibition Room: Physical chemistry is the theoretical basis of all chemistry. What is displayed in this Ning place can be divided into photochemistry, thermochemistry, electrochemistry, colloid chemistry, and solution properties. Various instruments are very sophisticated, such as glass electrodes and bomb calorimeters.</p>
<p>Second Microanalysis Chemistry Exhibition Room: Microanalysis is an analytical method that has developed rapidly in recent years and is a major advancement in recent chemistry. Our school has specially set up this subject, which is rare among universities in China. The balances and instruments used are mostly newly purchased and are very accurate.</p>
<p>Third Biochemistry Exhibition Room: Biochemistry is based on the study of the nutritional value of various foods; so we use models to tell everyone. Other displays include the importance of seaweed, the method of judging the quality of milk, and fat extraction devices.</p>
<p>Fourth and Fifth Industrial Chemistry Exhibition Rooms: Industrial chemistry is practical chemistry. It is also a part of chemistry that has the most direct relationship with people's lives. We are also most interested in this subject. In order to make the public understand the situation of various industries, we display the production procedures and products one by one, such as paint making, leather making, paper making, etc., which are all important industries. There are also various unit machines, such as grinders, vacuum distillation machines, emulsifiers, high-pressure heaters, and clarifying separators, etc., to show their use in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>Sixth National Defense Chemistry and Inorganic Chemistry Exhibition Room: National defense chemistry is knowledge that every citizen should always know. This room displays the preparation methods of various poisonous gases, as well as defense methods, the manufacturing and structure of gas masks. There are also the manufacture and release of various colored signal flares. The fuel problem is also an important national defense matter. Therefore, some of our students are studying the gas phase cracking method of extracting gasoline from vegetable oil. It is also displayed here. Inorganic chemistry is the basis of chemistry. What we display includes various methods for determining molecular weight, various demonstration devices, as well as Hawkins' three-dimensional periodic table and other various periodic tables, and the actual objects are displayed in them. There are also the characteristics of various inorganic compounds, etc.</p>
<p>Seventh Laboratory: Most of the items displayed here are water testing and analysis. Among them is the work recently entrusted by the Wu County Government to our county to conduct chemical testing on behalf of the county in order to determine the water source for the establishment of a city-wide water supply.</p>
<p>Eighth Analytical Chemistry Exhibition Room: The composition of each substance can only be determined by analytical chemistry. In this room, there are special analysis methods, semi-micro analysis, ordinary qualitative and quantitative analysis, such as opium analysis methods, and new auxiliary coin analysis, as well as various special instruments used for analysis, such as colorimeters, turbidity meters, and oxidation prevention devices, etc. Some of them are specially designed and custom-made by our department. Each student in our school who studies analytical chemistry has one.</p>
<p>Ninth Organic Chemistry Exhibition Room: There are more than 200,000 kinds of organic compounds in the world, which shows the importance of organic chemistry. What we display includes various extraction devices, various filtration methods, various distillation devices, the quantitative determination method of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in organic matter, the fuel problem, and the preparation procedures of various organic matter, etc.</p>
<h3>History and Exhibition Overview of the Biology Department</h3>
<p>Our department has a history of more than 20 years. It is the earliest university in the country to establish a biology department. It was initially founded by Dr. Qi Tianxi. Later, Mr. Hu Jingfu, Mr. Dai Su, and Mr. Zhang He successively presided over it. The management was difficult. Various facilities have gradually become perfect. Animal and plant specimens, various charts, and slides of embryology, animal and plant histology, entomology, plant morphology, parasitology, and mycology are even more beautiful. In the past year, with the promotion and assistance of the Ministry of Education, there has been more progress. Graduation theses have always focused on the exploration of domestic and local organisms. Therefore, there is more research on the animals and plants of Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>Our school is located in the three Wu areas. The products are abundant and the collection is excellent. In view of the fact that the experimental materials of various academic institutions and schools are all transported from overseas, the leakage is very large. There is a plan to establish a biological materials office. With the assistance of the Rockefeller Foundation and the Science Society, it can be realized. It has been established for more than a year. It can be used by various places in the country. The publication of "Two-Month Magazine" has made more contributions to the biological community. Based on the experience gained over the years, this office has made many developments in technology. Such as animal anatomy and colored injection of blood vessels and other technologies are even more difficult. European and American countries and all provinces in the country have authorized the products of this office, and have won good reputation. We are still continuing to work hard to live up to the expectations of all parties.</p>
<p>The Biology Exhibition of this year is a collaboration between the professors and students of the department to promote science and promote national construction. The exhibits are divided into fourteen sections. (1) Genetics and Eugenics. Examples of species exhibiting the laws of heredity such as fruit flies, corn, ladybugs, guinea pigs, etc., and human personality, constitution, characteristics, etc., are demonstrated. (2) Invertebrate Zoology. In addition to specimens, many live animals are added. (3) Comparative Anatomy of Vertebrates. There are dissections of human bodies and higher animals. (4) Animal Histology. There are slides with magnified depictions, and real objects of organ structures, etc. (5) Parasitology. In addition to displaying the necessary items for academics, more attention is paid to common sense. (6) Entomology. There are various live animals and representative specimens of classifications. Special explanations are given for harmful and beneficial insects. (7) Herpetology. There are no less than 30 or 40 kinds of salamanders, shellfish, toads, lizards, snakes, turtles, etc. Most of those produced locally are collected. Specimens of those not produced locally are also set up. In terms of practical use, there are displays and rearing methods of American giant frogs. (8) Embryology. There are developmental procedures for various mammalian embryos, and embryo specimens such as fish and frogs. (9) Plant Morphology. There are various algae, moss ferns, cryptogams, phanerogams, and other plants. (10) Plant Taxonomy. More attention is paid to local plants. All those that are wild or artificially cultivated and are related to taxonomy are displayed. (11) Plant Physiology. There are examples of plant absorption, photochemical action, and environmental relationships. (12) Mycology. There are antibiotic tests, bacterial cultures, disinfection methods, etc. (13) Economic Botany. There are various kinds of wood and their manufactured goods such as fruits, grains, paints, medicines, etc. (14) Animal and Plant Experimental Materials and Slide Making Methods. Displays of taxidermy skeletons, transparent specimens, water travel boxes, and various slide making and staining techniques.</p>
<p>Last autumn, my colleagues and I realized that scholars in this country have only fragmented research on freshwater organisms, especially on the value of sanitation and economy, and there is also a lack of concrete and systematic research. Therefore, there is a plan to establish a freshwater biology research institute. Liu Chengzhao was appointed to preside over it. Wu Zhong is known as the country of Ze. There are lakes and marshes everywhere. There are very rich freshwater organisms. Setting up a research institute will provide many materials and will surely have great results. Now, during the exhibition, the establishment ceremony will be held. Most of the items displayed this time are live animals. All aquatic plants, plankton, fish, shrimp, shellfish, aquatic insects, and other lower animals are brought together. In addition, there are more than 40 kinds of fishing net models and various fishing methods. However, at the beginning of the opening, we still hope that domestic scholars and people from all walks of life will not hesitate to give advice. Our school will do our best to work in academics, economics, sanitation, and statistics. So as not to betray the good intentions of the elegant.</p>

<h3>Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory of the Chemistry Department of Soochow University</h3>
<h3>Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>— Ding Xuyan</p>
<p>We must acknowledge that the revival of Germany, the success of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, and Italy's victory over Abyssinia are all the result of their emphasis on science and diligent research. They are the result of their people having a considerable degree, understanding, and faith in science. China, as one of the ancient civilized nations, is not inferior to European and American countries in philosophy, literature, and art, and even surpasses them in some areas. However, it is undeniable that China's science is still immature and backward. Therefore, saving the nation through science and the movement for scientific advancement are extremely urgent needs today.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, exhibitions of various kinds have sprung up everywhere in China. Art exhibitions, literature exhibitions, calligraphy and painting exhibitions have emerged like a rising tide, each showing its unique strengths. Only scientific exhibitions are rarely seen. It is true that scientific exhibitions are extremely difficult to organize due to factors such as materials, personnel, funding, time, and location. But can we be afraid of difficulties and seek only ease and comfort? Can we not use our spare time and the facilities of the science departments in our schools to engage in small-scale—beneficial and inexpensive—scientific advancement movements?</p>
<p>If a scientific exhibition in China were to be organized by a national university in Sichuan, it could have a large-scale presentation and cause a sensation, attracting the attention or praise of the people. Now, a private school—Soochow University—is attempting this. It feels a lack of resources in terms of materials. It can only move forward towards the future of science with a "once every three years" effort, based on the spirit of "hard work, relentless effort, and quick action." We dare not harbor any extravagant hopes. However, in my opinion, the significance of this Soochow Science Exhibition is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>First, it can expand the scientific knowledge of young people. In recent years, the government's educational policy has emphasized practical sciences. Young students cannot help but take the path of science. They have a strong desire for knowledge, but their knowledge usually comes from textbooks. In a science exhibition, there are various instruments, specimens, medicines, models, machines, charts, reference documents, and so on, which can allow them to gain intuitive concepts from physical objects. This can arouse their interest in research and make their wisdom more deeply impressed and particularly applicable.</p>
<p>Second, it can make science a public study: China has abundant resources, but how to utilize these resources, how to use precise scientific methods, and how to conduct practical research on the issues that need to be resolved, scientific colleagues can cooperate and work together. For example, multiple people can study a particular problem from multiple perspectives at the same time. The contributions may be different, but the effect will be more complete. If universities and academic institutions across the country could regularly organize scientific exhibitions, everyone could learn from each other. Wouldn't that be great? Moreover, public research is also an attitude that scientists should maintain.</p>
<p>Third, it can popularize and simplify science: The general public often has doubts or even contempt for the effectiveness of science. Some consider it a "trivial skill" that is of no benefit to the nation, while others consider it too theoretical and not practical for everyday use. If these misconceptions are not corrected effectively and subtly, it will be a major obstacle to the progress of science. If scientific exhibitions can be held from time to time throughout the country, not only will the above-mentioned misconceptions be swept away, but the public will also be somewhat baptized by science. Only then can the movement for scientific advancement in China be considered a success.</p>
<p>Fourth, it can make everyone realize that scientific research is not as easy or as difficult as generally imagined. People often either do not trust scientists very much or are too demanding of them. For example, if they ask a question and cannot get an answer immediately because it involves too much, they always feel dissatisfied. This is because they see science as too easy and too simple. Conversely, some people think that pseudoscience is more difficult than anything else and simply ignore it. However, although problems may be complex, careful study will ultimately reveal the underlying principles. Science exhibitions provide clear and accurate observations of a speck of dust, a drop of blood, an atom, or an electron, and offer simple and thorough explanations, so that everyone can believe that to solve many scientific problems, one must use instruments and medicines for experiments, refer to literature, and be prepared to sacrifice considerable energy and time. Otherwise, there is no hope. However, these experiments, references, and sacrifices are of considerable value. As long as one is willing to experiment, refer, and sacrifice, there will be corresponding results. Therefore, one of the meanings of a science exhibition is to gain public sympathy and understanding for the painstaking efforts of scientists, so that they will not say that science is as easy as turning one's hand or as difficult as climbing to the sky.</p>
<p>Soochow University is holding a scientific exhibition to promote science, awaken the public, and encourage public research. This exhibition has been held several times in the past. However, this year, the only Freshwater Biological Research Institute in China was officially established at our school. At the same time, the school's new gymnasium and new women's dormitory were also completed. This is a rare opportunity that yields multiple benefits. However, regarding the preparation and arrangement of this exhibition, there are still many imperfections. We hope that enthusiastic colleagues and people from all walks of life will be extra forgiving and further guide us. April 20, 1937, at the College of Science, Soochow University</p>

<h3>Children's Health Competition</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, people in our country have gradually become aware of the importance of children's health. For example, the organization of children's health competitions by various institutions is one example. Recently, this competition will be held again in our city. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Health Education Society is scheduled to hold a children's health competition on the 25th of this month. All public and private kindergartens and primary schools in the city are encouraged by their principals to actively participate, bringing students and their families. In addition, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Clinic, established by the Chinese Children's Welfare Association in Zhabei, is also scheduled to hold a large-scale children's health competition for three days starting on the 24th of next month. Five hundred participants will be divided into three groups: infants, toddlers, and young children.</p>
<p>The purpose of holding children's health competitions is to guide children's hygiene and promote children's health. The intention can be said to be extremely good. Because children are the future strength of the nation, the strength or weakness of children's bodies is related to the prosperity or decline of the nation, which is very important. Therefore, all countries attach great importance to children's health issues. Governments and various health education organizations are working hard on children's health. Our country's awareness of children's health has only emerged in recent years. However, thanks to the efforts of people in society, although the results are not very good, they have had quite an impact. Holding children's health competitions many times can awaken the attention of parents in general families. However, to protect children's health, it is not enough to just hold competitions. After the competition, once we understand the health status of children, we should find ways to improve children's physical fitness and make them strong. Otherwise, holding the competition is just a lively event, and it does not bring much benefit to children.</p>
<p>Looking at the general situation, the health of children in our country is obviously very deficient. Because children in ordinary families lack education due to environment and various other reasons, there are few children with strong physiques and many with weak physiques. Let us take the children in schools as an example. According to a previous test of tuberculosis bacteria in primary school students in our city, the results of the test of 2,916 people in five schools showed that 2,137 people had been infected, 739 people had not been infected, and the reaction of 40 people was unknown. From this statistic, it can be seen that the number of people with tuberculosis bacteria is as high as 70%, which is a considerable number. Also, not long ago, a report was published in the education column of this newspaper. A physical examination of primary school students in this city showed that among 9,000 students examined, 8,000 had shortcomings, accounting for 90% of the total number. This number is even more alarming. The unhealthy bodies of children in our country can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that it is important to care about children's health and hold competitions, but it is even more important to find remedies after the competition. For example, the health status of primary school students in this city is extremely worrying and must be remedied. This point should be emphasized by the health education authorities. Recently, Japan has paid close attention to national health. The health facility expenses for students proposed by the Ministry of Education have been passed by the parliament and will use 150,000 yuan to conduct a nationwide youth physical examination over a period of five years to investigate whether young people across the country have any diseases and their activity capacity, and to study concrete ways to improve national health. If our country can follow this approach, it will definitely be of considerable help to the physical fitness of the people.</p>
<h3>A Trip in Spring</h3>
<p>— Ping Zi</p>
<p>Squeezed inside a heavy truck, and the road is so uneven, I really feel a lot of distress.</p>
<p>"When will we get through this bumpy road?"—I asked myself this, but I didn't know. Maybe it's like the road of life, you can stop at any time, but it won't stop in this very short time, because what my eyes see is still an endless plain.</p>
<p>The weather is also getting hot. It's said to be spring, but it also makes people impatient. The yellow soil rolled up by the wheels rushed up from behind like smoke. I coughed because I didn't have time to cover my mouth and nose with a handkerchief. On each face moistened by sweat, the color of the soil was attached, either thick or light. I laughed when I saw other people's faces, and my own face was also ridiculous. At this moment, we arrived at the place we wanted to go.</p>
<p>It was a famous scenic spot famous for plum blossoms. By the time we went, all the plum blossoms had fallen to the ground.</p>
<p>"Ah, too late!"—Sighs rose in everyone's heart like smoke, but this may not be entirely true. Some people were not lost in the petals abandoned on the ground, as if some kind of melancholy was heavily pressing on their hearts. It seems that they grew up in the city and are disturbed by human affairs every day, and they live happily and contentedly. When they arrive at this rustic place, they feel that everything is fresh, and they also think they should be a little refined, so they are as sentimental as talented scholars and beautiful women.</p>
<p>But I am relaxed, just like a person from outside the world, watching the clear water flowing down from the top of the small mountain: Someone is putting a small boat folded out of paper into the water to see where it can flow. The younger ones, smiling, follow the small paper boats floating on the water, walking along the quiet path, through the mountain valleys.</p>
<p>In my reverie, why couldn't that be a grand river? The river center is uneven, and the river flows there, turning all kinds of flowers and turning in different directions. Then there is a loud sound, but I am alone by the river, gazing intently. Suddenly I have the thought of wading across the water, how can I get to the other shore, there is no boat here? I am anxious, grabbing my head with my hands. Because I felt pain, I realized that what was in front of me was just a small mountain stream, and I could cross to the other side with just one step. I smiled.</p>
<p>When I looked up, I didn't know when the people who came with me had dispersed. So I walked alone towards the path up the small mountain. In this quiet mountain path, I saw pairs of men and women leaning against each other. I was indifferent, sweating slightly, wetting my hair.</p>
<p>A burst of wooden fish sounds came over, so I walked towards that side. Finally, I walked to the main hall with a door open, stepped over the high threshold, and saw several monks in cassocks kneeling in front of the statue. The low and devout voice touched my heart, and I took off my hat.</p>
<p>Many thoughts were swimming in my chest like fish. I walked out of the hall door blankly and sat down on the stone bench in front of the door, hugging my knees with my hands, staring blankly ahead.</p>
<p>The shadow of the tree drew the trunks for the fallen flowers on the ground. I imagined the plum blossoms that bloomed white on the branches, as if they were shining in my eyes again. I looked happily, but suddenly a loud voice pierced my ears:</p>
<p>"Ah! I didn't expect you to be sitting here alone!"</p>
<p>I looked up at him and found his hurried appearance a little funny. I didn't answer him, just nodded.</p>
<p>"We're waiting for you alone, we're about to go back."</p>
<p>"Are we going back?"—I stood up lazily with a heart full of attachment: Repeatedly looking at a tree with all the flowers fallen, and the flowers that fell from the tree all over the ground.</p>
<p>It's really hasty!—I sighed and followed the person behind me.</p>
<h3>March Loneliness</h3>
<p>— Leon</p>
<p>When the warm spring breeze and gorgeous sunshine sprinkle on the world. People are grateful for the holy grace, happiness ah happiness! The water in the pond smiled in the spring breeze, slowly, slowly, flowing the clear sky in March, and the pond water was filled with soft azure blue.</p>
<p>The clear sky in March is vast, with white clouds floating, bathing in spring water, floating, transforming, and disappearing below the outlines of uneven buildings.</p>
<p>There are people on the street selling peeled tender yams, spring bamboo shoots, and wolfberry vines. Fresh seasonal products are only the good fortune of those gluttons. In this season, most of them suffer from stomach weakness, and their nourishment is the warm sunshine outside the window, the gentle flowing wind, and some abstract products of the natural world.</p>
<p>Everywhere there are iron pillars and stone walls, life is really suppressed and depressed. In a world like a stone pavement covered with steel plates, finding a sprout on a flower is like dreaming of fishing for the moon at the bottom of the water. The daily calendar with a strong smell of ink has been bringing spring to the world day by day, but even the park has not been visited. People who are ground by life all day long and isolated from nature are very indifferent to the change of seasons.</p>
<p>Bright sunshine from the bright glass window, one or two sparrows are singing a clear song under the eaves, the red plum branch seen at the corner of the wall is withering, and the petals are falling. A subconscious thought, a trace of sadness, a moment of feeling lost. Ah, March, March is lonely!</p>
<p>When the bright March sunshine is covered by coal smoke into a dark shade, when the birdsong is frightened away by the whistle, when the fallen flowers and branches are swept away by the cleaners, has spring arrived before your eyes? Are there any other examples of spring? Searching, anytime and anywhere, but always disappointed.</p>
<p>But this day was an accident. In a vegetable market filled with a fishy smell, I discovered the reporter of spring - yellow rapeseed flowers. So my heart couldn't help but be secretly overjoyed. In the vendor's bamboo basket, bundles and bundles were neatly piled up. The small yellow flowers clustered into balls, the light green stamens, and the emerald green buds, piled up like beads, revealed the mysterious gestation of nature in the subtle, "Seeing the world in a grain of sand," Leike's philosophy was deeply engraved on the heart version. The dew contained in the yellow flowers and emerald green buds, illuminated by the sun, emitted a crystal clear light, so I felt dazzled in front of me. Is the crystal clearness of the water droplets between the rapeseed flowers, or in my own eyes? Even the nerve sensation is blurred, and a little moistness is in my heart.</p>
<p>Although it is the clear and bright March in front of me, I have a heart like a rainy day.</p>
<p>The heart of a rainy day is lonely, the sunshine in March is lonely, like a young widow imprisoned in an ancient nunnery, unable to bear the shackles of her nature. The vitality is locked into a dark and desperate environment. It is time now, and a suitable key is needed, or a sledgehammer is also straightforward. Some fire is needed, or the power of some explosives is also possible. I want to open the warehouse of the dull environment, I want to illuminate the darkness here and there, I want to explode all the imprisoned vitality, I will finally drive away the loneliness that is sinking to the bottom of life....</p>
<p>"I am not a prisoner of the season," I ruled myself like this.</p>
<p>But the deep alley in the daytime of March is entirely surrounded by loneliness, and even the footsteps of the dog walking by can be heard clearly. The white sun smears the high wall, just like the white face of an anemic patient. The jujube tree across the wall still protrudes its withered branches. March has not yet seen new green. I don't know who is playing the piano again. Every note is trembling. March, it's spring, why do you need this sad tune! It calls people to close their hearts and gives people a feeling of bleakness! This unbearable loneliness in March needs a heavy bomb.</p>
