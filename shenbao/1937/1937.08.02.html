<h3>日本間諜在華南的活動</h3>
<p>— 蔡力行</p>
<p>日本帝國主義者為着要獨佔中國，除開採用武力掠奪的殘酷政策之外，還採用種種陰險，刻毒，卑鄙無恥的手段，諸如派遣得力間諜，從事特務活動，便是其中之一。現在日本在華的間諜網，已經佈滿各地，平津冀察綏滬等地的特務機關，已採取公開活動的方式，魯晋豫陝等處，亦已成為公開的秘密。這樣看來，從華北到華中，已完全在敵人間諜包圍之下了。</p>
<p>最近聽說華南各地，亦有建立特務機關的消息，經過記者多方調查，得悉此間日方特務工作，本由各地領館負責，自從去年北海事件以後，日方卽在香港建立特務機關，由小田及安村魚責指揮，內部分設情報，社會，軍事，破壞數系，並在華南各南各地組織活動隊，現已成立者計有廣州　香港汕頭瓊崖　廈門各一隊，每隊之下分設若干小組不等，但有些地方人數太少，如福州海口梧州，便成立直屬小組，歸該機關直接領導。</p>
<p>在目前，他們的活動範圍，是以粵桂閩三省為限，暫時不分省界，其工作綱領，卽看重下列各項：</p>
<p>㊀偵探　華南各地軍事實力，諸如駐防軍隊的分佈，民衆武力的組織等等。</p>
<p>㊁偵查　華南各地的國防設備，交通情形，軍事工業狀况，並設法予以破壞。</p>
<p>㊂收買　過去軍政腐化人員如人民政府　殘餘份子，粵桂兩省失意軍人。</p>
<p>㊃偵查並破壞　各級黨部及民衆團體的活動，並設法運動各種不穩份子，破壞抗日救亡工作。</p>
<p>㊄說法分化　中央與西南當局的關係，以移轉地方當局及人物的抗日情緒。</p>
<p>㊅聯絡地方　奸商市儈，組織走私機關，實行武力保運，給予商人利益，以建立在漢奸走狗中的信仰。</p>
<p>㊆利用日韓正當商人，以經商為名，分赴內地活動，從事間諜工作。</p>
<p>自蘆溝橋事變發生後，該機關活動更為緊張，現擬漢奸份子，加緊訓練，特設下層幹部訓練班，將各地漢奸，集中訓練，以便應付將來重大事變。此項訓練時間，預定二星期至三星期，參加者均係親信走狗。訓練的課目，大概有情報技術，偵探術，破壞術、化裝術，社會調查，華南方言等等。</p>
<p>現聞該班職員係以特務機關負責人小田擔任主任，並向上海特務機關長楠本接洽，商派指導人才，已派上海同文書院敎授小野等南下，協同訓練，這一次訓練完畢後，便分發各地工作。</p>
<p>單就日本特務機關在華南的陰謀，便可證明敵人的侵略是毫無止境的，貪圖局部的苟安是做不到的，華北的烽火已經燃燒了，我們惟有以牙還牙，以眼還眼，才能制止敵人侵略的野心！</p>

<h3>時評</h3>
<h3>要求從速收復平津失地</h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>並追悼佟趙兩將</p>
<p>陸軍第二十九軍副軍長佟麟閣。陸軍第一百三十二師師長趙登禹。於北伐剿匪及喜峯口諸役。均能克敵制勝。懋著動猷。不幸前日南苑之役。趙師長四次衝鋒。以身殉職。佟軍長指揮殺敵。葬身砲火。此種忠勇衛國的將領。竟變為歷史上忠義傳中人物。殊為痛惜。現在國府明令褒䘏追封上將。宣矣。</p>
<p>現在我國最須要。最缺少。而最寶貴的。便是此種人物。土地的陷落。可以收回。文化機關的破壞。還可重建。而此種忠勇衛國的將領。實在不易多得。亦是一去不來。</p>
<p>敵人此次轟炸南開大學。破壞我文化機關。是其用心。果然毒辣而殘忍。然我猶認為不甚重要。重要之點。不在此處。我意現在的問題。亦是最急要的問題。便是能够收復平津和不能收復平津的問題。假定平津而能够收復。卽使南開現在雖受絕大的損失。事後恢復。畢竟還有辦法。况平津的最高學府。共有六個之多。除兩個係外人所組織者不計外。若平津不能恢復。非但南開。卽其餘一切文化機關。及人民土地均淪於敵人之手。則我國之文化盡變為敵人的文化。我國的土地人民。盡變為敵國的土地人民。則此次南開卽無損失。亦何可喜之有。更以南開而例平津。眞如九牛之一毛。</p>
<p>國家之所實者。土地。人民。政治。而已。但有土而不能守。有政而無人治。有民而無人管。本不能認為國家。現在平津雖已陷落。而官吏還是官吏。並且還是號稱我國的官吏。地方機關還是地方機關。並且還是號稱我人民的機關。何舊缺少一點。此次平津陷落的緣故。不是敵人的飛機大砲。便是吃這樣一般人的話。我們現在應當從速收復平津失地。肅清一般羣醜。實為我國當局最重要的任務。亦是我國當局義不容辭的任務。現在一切公理正誼人道多談不到。現在爭論是非曲直的時期已經過去。我們祗有萬衆一心。整齊步伐。慷慨激昴。沈着殺敵。此外多是空話。我們現在更不談勝負。不談任何犧牲。我們已至退無可退。讓無讓的最後一步。祗有準備着犧牲。與敵人拼個你死我活。</p>
<p>小小的勝不足喜。小小的敗不足懼。人生不過百年。患醒紅熱死。患虎烈拉亦死。近者不過數年。遠者不過數十年而終歸於死。死原為人生無可逃避之法網。但是死有泰山鴻毛之別。救國的血。是流最有榮譽的血。是流最有價值的血。是為我國民族生存而所流的血。趙登禹在飛機大砲中四次衝鋒陷陣而所流之血。佟麟閣在南苑督戰而所流之血。以及前敵數萬將士。因衝鋒肉博而所流的血。這種血何等名貴。何等有價值。我輩當馨香而崇拜之。服地而痛哭之。則佟趙等軀殼雖死。其靈魂必不死。若一般漢奸走狗賣國求榮之徒。其名雖未死。但是行屍走肉。其靈魂早已死盡。徒供後人的唾罵。</p>
<h3>日本侵略無已危害世界和平</h3>
<p>我進行與各關係國接洽　舍集體制外無以保安全</p>
<p>［巴黎］中國駐法大使顧維鈞今日與美聯社記者談話、謂“中國已與九國公約簽字國家進行談話、現在中國不但能援引該約、且亦贊成此舉、目前談話之範圍、固尚以徵求各簽字國之意見為限、而各國則當然希望華盛頓方面能首先倡議、同時中國亦已進行與關係各國討論國聯盟約及凱洛格公約之規定、日本之侵略華北、實為九一八以來之一貫政策、蓋欲囊括亞洲大陸、故華北之後、卽將向蘇俄進取、然後再圖華中華南、而及於馬來半島·荷屬東印度、此次戰爭將影響太平洋中之均勢、美國將首當其衝、中國决奮鬥到底、現在已開始實行戰時組織、世界旣不能劃分為各自獨立之區域、故遠東之戰爭、實為全世界之問題、且茍非集體安全亦無眞正之可言、余已與法國外部屢次談話、法國人士非常同情、不獨明瞭目前之情形、且亦深知此次戰事對於世界和平前途之關係”云、（卅一日國民電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］此間各觀察家頃評論西班牙內亂問題云、西國內亂對于中日兩國糾紛、不無發生影響之處、歐洲各國旣因此而互相爭持、其在全世界所享有之權威、自必大見减削、而無以見重于人矣云、（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美參議員反對美國施中立法</h3>
<p>因此舉於日本無損　深恐易致牽入戰渦</p>
<p>［華盛頓］參議員路易斯今日竭力反對美國對於此次中日危機實施中立法、路氏謂美國如實施該法、則於一小時內卽可與中國或日本　甚至中日兩國同時開戰、要求實施該法者、不知美國倘宣布任何一國為侵略者、而承認兩國已正式開戰、則美國以貨物運至遠東之商船、卽可被指以軍需供給敵人而予以沒收、美國人民亦將被執而受拘禁、屆時美國勢必以海軍　援救美人之生命財產、如此卽將與中日二國開戰矣、是故為避免此等事件發生起見、總統必須繼續設法勸告西班牙　及遠東之衝突各方、於相當條件之下重復和平云、（三十一日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］今日紐約泰晤士報論評、題為“美國之外交政策”、全文照譯如下、</p>
<p>美國國會議員中、有促羅斯福總統對於遠東事件、採取所謂一九三七年之中立法者、此種法律、規定美國不得以軍火　輸供戰鬥國家、並授總統特權、在現金購買與運輸自行負責之原則下、得准他項材料之輸出、一九三七年過去五個月中、美國輸至中日兩國之貨品、共值一萬六千五百萬元、大都為棉花廢鐵機件等、此類貨品在情理上、均得認為戰爭所用材料、倘總統確認亞洲已入戰爭狀態、則現金購買與運輸自行負責之交易、顯然有害於中國而無損於日本、緣日本藏有大量黃金與現洋、可作現金、有大批商輪可供運輸、中國之金準備僅及日本三分之一、卽無近代商輪、復無近代海軍之可言、是則中立法果眞施諸亞洲兩大國家、徒見其不中立而已、此種結果自與美國無關、蓋美國所冀諸中立法者、無非為維護自身地位、不顧其他結果、但此種法律非惟不合中立原則、抑亦不能實行、國會外交委員會主席畢特門氏之言曰、總統現正力圖保護中國戰區內之美僑、但中立法一旦施行、總統調停戰爭與保護美僑之權力、立卽受其摧殘、易言之、徒使美國所處地位愈增其危險、尚有一點為畢特門氏所未曾道及者、卽歷來美國之遠東外交政策、為維護中國領土之完整與門戶開放政策、易言之、各國在華須有商務上之均等機會、倘因中立法而使美國與國際事件相隔絕、則美國之外交政策安得不遭障碍、要而言之、美國倘不準備維護海外之權利、担負本身之責任、對於犧牲者與侵略者不分其軒輊、則是自减其世界一大强國之勢力云、（一日中央社電）</p>
<h3>德俄報評論中日局勢</h3>
<p>中國欲求獨立生存　發揮力量此其時矣</p>
<p>［柏林］德國報紙密切注視遠東局勢、以為華北之抗戰、乃中國民族開始演變之象徵、亦為中國活動力恢復之表現、目前日軍似佔優勢、然日本軍人是否優於中國軍人、尚係疑問也、英美不能保衛中國、而中國必須憑藉本國之體力與智力、一般歐洲人士、不易瞭解此種力量、惟有德國具備同樣之經騐、二千年來德國民族常發揮其本身力量、以維持其生存、中國亦常保其自信力也、今日中國已開始抵抗、將來歐洲各國在亞洲之地位、繫於對中國復興之認識與諒解云（三十一日海通電）</p>
<h3>日本假借反共掩飾對華侵略</h3>
<p>［莫斯科］“眞理報”論華北局勢云、“日本軍閥已决定變華北為第二“滿洲國、此為適宜的時機、世人周知日人之侵略方法、首先自造‘事件’、繼則派兵鎮壓、最後則屠殺平民、佔領鄰邦土地、華北事件之展開、更使全世界深知日人所謂反共運動、實際全係侵佔鄰邦領土”、</p>
<p>該報繼論廣田關於中日糾紛之演說稱、“彼廣田先生未嘗不知中國人民决不延頸受日帝國主義之宰割、然渠仍貌示鎮靜、依能完全確定在華利益有關的各資本主義、國家、尤其是英國、將坐視侵略不加聞問之後、乃大放厥辭、廣田之演說證明日本政策毫無變更、仍係遵照軍閥之命令行事、”該報復論及日蘇交涉謂、“蘇政府早對日方表示願意組織解决邊界糾紛委員會及勘界委員會、並要求在勘界以前、尊重北京及奉天條約規定的現在邊界、而日方則悍然不顧、委員會迄今未能組織、”</p>
<p>眞理報結論云、“日內閣在特別議會發表的演說、證明該國外交政策自‘九一八’以來毫未變更、佐藤充任外相之短期中、西歐政客曾以為　日政策已趨緩和、實屬完全錯誤、”（三十一日塔斯社電）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>讀保衛蘆溝橋</h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>蘆溝橋的烽火起來了之後，給前綫忠勇將士以回響的，是全民一致的堅决的吼聲：抗戰到底—跟前綫將士的“蘆溝橋是我們的墳墓”相呼應的，是“保衛蘆溝橋”！</p>
<p>“保衛蘆溝橋”！這雄壯的呼聲不僅是代表了全民對前綫將士的感激和欽佩，也不僅是表示“誓為後盾”，這裏面，更有着一重更大的意義：中國四萬萬五千萬的國民，是同一個脈搏的有機體，是同一意志的鐵的集團！</p>
<p>可奈情勢“劇變”得太快，當前綫將士們準備用血肉來報答國家的時候，他們却為漢奸所出卖了。戰士們是不惜一死，不吝一死的，然而他們却想不到會死在漢奸之手。——蘆溝橋在北平失陷以後继以陷落了。</p>
<p>因之，當聞到蘆溝橋事變以後就動員了全體會員合編的，中國劇作者協會的三幕劇“保衛蘆溝橋，”脫稿付印，裝訂成書以後，和讀者相見，便有了“遲了”的感覺。</p>
<p>可是眞的是遲了嗎？蘆溝橋在目前雖是失陷了，但保衛蘆溝橋的精神却到現在並未消失，不祇沒有消失，並且還正在擴大，正在生長，以這樣的浩然之氣，堅實地做去，我們堅信蘆溝橋將永遠是我們中國的！我們並且敢保證蘆溝橋將永遠是我們的！</p>
<p>第二，蘆溝橋人民和蔣士所身受的切身之痛，現在也正降臨到華北各地的人民和守土將士身上，自己種的豆子給敵人的坦克車壓壞了，住的屋子給敵人毀了，而換得的是敵人的鞭子和拳脚，這難道還不够使我們受，這難道還能使我們忘却蘆溝橋！</p>
<p>第三，我們“單呌抵抗不中用，我們要揮刀直向敵人衝”！我們“不能坐守等人打，我們要將進攻消滅進攻”！（見保衛蘆溝橋”第三部插曲：衝鋒歌。）賬應該從頭算起，我們在蘆溝橋事件之前，還有東北四省，如果以狹義來解釋“保衛蘆溝橋”，我們難道以“保衛蘆溝橋”就能滿足嗎？</p>
<p>我們要“保衛蘆溝橋”，我們“單呌抵抗不中用，我們要揮刀直向敵人衝”！</p>
<p>“我們有筆的時候用筆，有嘴的時候用嘴，到嘴筆都來不及用的時候，便勢將以血肉和敵人相搏於戰塲。我們不甘心做奴隸，我們願以鮮血向敵人保證我們民簇的永存”！（見“保衛蘆溝橋”代序。）</p>
<p>蘆溝橋的烽火，是復興中華民族的烽火，“保衛蘆溝橋”的怒吼，是中華民族醒覺的初聲！</p>
<p>保衛蘆溝橋！保衛華北！保衛祖國！</p>
<h3>維護察北</h3>
<p>— 亞廬</p>
<p>在華北敵寇侵犯的緊急聲中，我們得到應加注意的兩個消息：據一日山西電：“察北匪偽連日復乘機活動，閻主任為防萬一，特電綏遠前方部隊，嚴加戒備；又據歸化電：“湯恩伯三十一日由集寗來綏，與傅作義趙承綬共商綏境防務。”我們看到這兩個消息後，深信像閻主任幾年來在山西的勵精國治，切實苦幹抗敵，以及湯傅等收領在去歲綏遠，他們為國的忠勇，這次如果某方駿使的匪偽再來犯綏，必能予以痛擊，不為所侵。</p>
<p>我們知道這次日本既然大舉增兵華北，决不是僅僅得佔平津後，就算了事，牠們將有更遠大的野心，是極顯然的。那末察北匪偽乘機活動，不久的將來，必有擴大的可能，我們安能把牠忽視呢？</p>
<p>敵人能够屢次侵佔我國土，是因為我方沒有充足的準備。如果我們有切實的準備和奮勇的抗敵，至少可以保全敵人想奪我的地方，這種事實，在去歲綏遠戰爭中，就是很明顯的。</p>
<p>我們回想到去年綏戰某方的不得實現佔綏之計，同時再看到現在某方已發動唆使匪偽再度擾綏察的消息，預料某方對察綏的侵略是早有方案而且是抱有决心的。所以我方應早有積極禦侮的方策，來維護察綏。然而在敵熖盛熾的今日，要保守察綏，决不是單靠察綏地方當局和民衆所能够的，同時更需中央政府以及全國實力和民衆的熱忱，予以相當後援，纔能濟事。</p>
<p>事實告訴我們，平津失陷之後，敵人已得利用交通上的許多便利，可長驅直入於華北數省。我們為保全華北未失的省份計，固然要决心沉着抗敵；但是察綏是我們西北的屏障，其在外交政治上，在在足以影響我西北諸省、故我們欲保全西北諸省的完整，應當竭力維護察綏領土主權的安全。</p>
<p>時至今日，决不能再失我們的土地，因為失去一分土地，在敵方是會强一分實力，在我們却滅弱一分實力。這是我們全國上下應該認清的。</p>
<h3>魚船</h3>
<p>— 春野</p>
<p>四月的風帶來了初夏的熱浪在海面上吹，南國的海邊浮現出了成羣的捕魚的船隻，又是黃魚上市的季節了。</p>
<p>以產魚而得名的魚村，又呈現出了活躍的情况，魚商是成羣的到村里來設下收魚的商塲，出售日用品的小販也一年一度的來到村中推銷着他們的貨物，村婦是忙碌的在修補着舊網，村夫在整理着他們的魚船，孩子們更是在盼望着鮮魚的飽吃，總之，整個的魚村都在熱鬧的氣息中。</p>
<p>年老的人憑着他們的經騐報告了是出航的天氣了，於是那停泊在村前的沙灘上的一排排的魚船，像得到了命令的戰艦一樣成羣的向那遼闊的海洋出征了。當着船離開着沙灘的時候，村婦們是成羣的望着那船上的男人或兒子，眼角流着淚水，因為經騐告訴他們，出航的</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>魚船是往往失踪的，可是這些在年青的魚人並沒有覺得，他們整個的心情是給那滿載而歸的希望的野心所佔有了。</p>
<p>船在海面上飄，魚夫們的歌聲在空中飛迸，他們有的談着笑話，有的坐在船尾賭牌，有的在唱着山歌，他們在等待，等待着夜的到來。</p>
<p>太陽在海洋中是沉得那麼遲緩，魚村中也許已經燃起了油燈，可是深藍的海面却還在反射出刺眼的金光。魚夫們望着那將沉的太陽，萬條金光在閃耀的海面，他們在唱：</p>
<p>日頭紅紅沉下海，</p>
<p>打開網兒等魚來；</p>
<p>篤篤孤聲終夜響，</p>
<p>到了天光滿船財。（註一）</p>
<p>太陽終於沉入了水平綫了，海洋上就罩上了一層黑色的幕布，這時成羣的魚船，找出了他們的魚網，拿出了“打孤”的木板，開始的敲起了篤篤篤的孤聲，海洋是平靜的，只有海風在輕輕的吹，佈滿着海面的魚燈，正像那天空上明亮的星子。沒有笑聲沒有人影，只有篤篤的聲音佔着了整個的空間。</p>
<p>夏夜是短促的，一下子那東方的天際已露出了微白的曙色了。經騐告訴他們，魚夫們張開了巨網，向着船的四週散下去，空的網兒下去，沉重的網兒上來，他們在唱：</p>
<p>網兒空空輕來輕，</p>
<p>入了水里變千斤；</p>
<p>手去艙里摸來去，</p>
<p>都是我的好親親。（註二）</p>
<p>太陽照着村前的沙灘，黃沙就好像金子般的耀眼，這時人聲像雷般的在岸邊響着，那昨日出去的魚船，又是一羣羣的歸來了。村婦們在向着溫冷，孩子們在艙里摸着鮮貨，魚商們在評貨講價，沙灘上到處又流溢着熱鬧的聲浪，然而誰都在說：“今年又不比去年的多了，只有再看明天是怎樣了。”頹喪的顏色就塗上了沙灘上一切的人的臉。而識字的人在讀着報的說：“××魚船於魚汛期又在我華南領海出現。”</p>
<p>（註一）係華南一帶魚夫們的小曲，孤聲是用木板敲的，其作用係使魚聞聲而集於船邊，終因給聲音振昏而被捕，這是用了幾百年的捕魚法，而只有捕黃魚可以使用，俗捕黃魚呌“打孤”。</p>
<p>（註二）好親親係指魚。</p>
<h3>我們要拚死在疆場!</h3>
<p>— 綠英木刻</p>
<p>讀者呼聲</p>
<h3>請移打醮費作正用</h3>
<p>— 陳天賜</p>
<p>在上海，廢歷的七月裏，是有許多商號，或弄堂的住戶，他們會很迷信的，依着習俗，凑集了錢，請班和尚道士，做塲“太平公醮”，以為這樣可以超度鬼魂，免去野鬼們的纏繞，一年四季得以平安。其實這種事情，眞不值識者一笑。</p>
<p>試想，費了很多錢，所看見的是什麼，只不過大家熱鬧一天，使那班和尚道士，錫箔店，及紙紮店賺些錢而已。</p>
<p>所以我建議本報讀者，凡是要舉行“太平公醮”的，請將這筆打醮費節省下來，即使有人要發起打醮，亦請讀者們盡力的攔阻，務使他們停止舉行，並將所省下的錢，移作正當的用途。</p>
<p>因為做一塲“太平公醮”，所費至少要數十元，如果節省，那末單是全上海一地，不難有數萬金，假使全國各地都能節省，聚沙成塔，豈非一筆很可觀的款子嗎？</p>
<p>於是我們把這筆省下的款子，來作義舉，捐給振災會，去救濟四川各地的災民，使這班嗷嗷待斃的同胞，得此甘露，可以活命，以便培養我國家的元氣。請想拿錢來做這樣的事，較之用在無益的打醮上，眞是有價值，而有意義。</p>
<p>又如這次蘆溝橋事件，强隣壓境，無理的要求種種苛刻條件，凡我民衆，忍無可忍，便崛起反抗，以求我國的生存，但是兵少糧缺，尤其是救護用品，更屬需要。</p>
<p>本報二十九日載，二十九軍駐滬辦事處長李廣安氏，所報告前方軍情說：“應請全國各界人士注意者，前方大戰一開，需要救護用品甚多，此種用品，以滬上購備較易，甚望滬上各界能迅為募集購備，送往前方應用。至以前各方為本軍募集捐款，當時宋委員長表示，因係局部抗戰，不敢受各方之金錢慰勞。但目下情勢不同，事態業已擴大，如舉辦救護工作，及籌設傷兵醫院等等，在在需款，尚望各界予以援助云。”</p>
<p>看了上面這節報告，可知前方喋血抗戰的將士們，是很需要着金錢接濟。我們不妨把這筆錢，去盡量的捐助前敵將士，或購備醫藥用品，使將士們得此鼓勵，更能為國禦敵。讀者們這不是把有用的金錢，用在最正當的地方嗎？</p>

<p>津訊，據傳本市當局“市長張自忠，”今日宣稱，和平尚未至絕望時期，蘆溝橋方面我軍已復員至八日前狀態，日方則仍未完全撤退，本人始終以國家為重。（十五日中央社北平電）</p>
<p>據官方稱，張自忠在津發表談話，略謂二十九軍已恢復八日前狀態，但日軍尚未完全撤退，張並稱姓張的决不做對不起民衆的事。（十五日中央社北平電）</p>
<p>聞宋哲元離平前，曾手諭張自忠等，分掌各機關職務，新任平警察局長潘毓桂，二十九日晨已到局視事，平市長張自忠定下午三時就職，至就冀察政會職務及日期尚未定。（二十九日中央社北平電）</p>

<h3>Tianjin Has Two Organizations</h3>

The other is a puppet organization directed by Japanese, called the Local Security Maintenance Committee, which was reportedly established on the afternoon of the 1st. The members are Gao Ling□, Wang Zhulin, Wang Xiaoyan, Shen Xianwu, Fang Yaoyu, etc. These people were mostly picked up by Japanese military police in cars on the morning of the 1st and taken to a meeting at the National Hotel at noon, with Gao serving as chairman. It is claimed that they will conduct business at the Hebei Mint on the 2nd and draft a public notice to reassure the people, which will be issued on the 2nd. At the same time, they will also handle the restoration of transportation and the stabilization of local affairs. It is noted that there is no connection between the two organizations mentioned above, and it is feared that the former will not be able to perform its duties due to the lack of Japanese support.

<h3>Franco-Japanese Authorities in Tianjin Are on Bad Terms</h3>
<p>Japanese Cut Off French Concession Telephone Lines, French Consul in Tianjin Protests to Japan</p>
<p>[Tianjin] After Japanese troops occupied the East Station on the 29th, they attacked the small number of French troops stationed inside, which led to increasingly strained relations between the authorities of the two countries in Tianjin. Currently, French troops are stationed at the Wanguo Bridge, strictly prohibiting Japanese soldiers from passing through. At the same time, Japanese troops have also cut off the telephone lines between the Dongjuzi French Barracks and the French Concession. The French Consul General in Tianjin has protested to the Japanese authorities. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] It is reported that a minor clash occurred between the French and Japanese sides yesterday. Japanese troops placed obstacles on the north side of the International Bridge and stationed troops with machine guns, preventing French soldiers from passing through. The French authorities protested to the Japanese military about the French barracks going to the East Arsenal. It was only learned that the Japanese had taken this action in retaliation for the French not allowing armed Japanese soldiers to pass through the French Concession. It is said that the French Concession's refusal to allow Japanese troops to carry weapons through was based on a resolution of the Consular Corps. (1st Central News Agency Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Vice Chairman Feng Composes a Poem Crying and Mourning Tong and Zhao</h3>
<p>Eating the people's fat and grease, receiving the country's upbringing, you must die like this! You two wait for me ahead, I will catch up with you soon.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Vice Chairman Feng was extremely saddened after learning that Generals Tong Linge and Zhao Dengyu had sacrificed their lives for the country. He now expresses his deep feelings for his comrades-in-arms and has composed a poem of mourning. The original text is excerpted as follows: "Mourning Tong and Zhao" Tong was a comrade for 26 years, Zhao was a brother for 23 years. We shared hardships together, we went through difficulties together. In terms of learning, Tong entered the Higher Education Group and worked for a year. Zhao entered the Training Group and returned to the camp after eight months. In terms of physique, they were equally strong, but Zhao was more heroic than Tong. Tong was good at training soldiers and was extremely meticulous. Zhao was good at killing enemies and attacking camps at night. Tong was extremely frugal and very sincere in teaching. Zhao was extremely filial and even more able to practice diligently. The two were equally loyal, the two were equally brave. Now they have both died for the country in the war against Japan, which makes me so sad, but when I think about the two of them, I feel very fortunate. Eating the people's fat and grease, receiving the country's upbringing, you must die like this, which is the best ending. Those who die later will strive to resist the war and take you as an example. Our entire nation is roaring angrily, unafraid of how rampant the enemy flames are. The final victory must be on our side, the final victory must be on our side. You two wait for me ahead, I will catch up with you soon. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Activities of Japanese Spies in South China</h3>
<p>— Cai Lixing</p>
<p>In order to monopolize China, Japanese imperialists, in addition to adopting cruel policies of armed plunder, also employ various insidious, venomous, and shameless means. One of these is to dispatch capable spies to engage in special agent activities. The Japanese spy network in China is now spread all over the country. Special agent organizations in areas such as Beiping, Tianjin, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanghai have adopted open methods of operation. In places like Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi, their activities have also become an open secret. Seen in this way, from North China to Central China, we are completely surrounded by enemy spies.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that special agent organizations have also been established in various parts of South China. After the reporter's many investigations, it was learned that the Japanese side's special agent work in this area was originally the responsibility of the consulates in various locations. Since the Beihai Incident last year, the Japanese side has established a special agent organization in Hong Kong, commanded by Oda and Yasumura. Internally, it is divided into intelligence, social, military, and sabotage departments. It has also organized action teams in various parts of South China. Teams have now been established in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Shantou, Hainan, Xiamen, and one team in each location. Each team is divided into several small groups of varying sizes. However, in some places, the number of people is too small, such as in Fuzhou, Haikou, and Wuzhou, so direct subordinate groups are established, directly led by the agency.</p>
<p>At present, their scope of activities is limited to the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, and temporarily not divided by provincial boundaries. Their work program focuses on the following items:</p>
<p>㊀ Reconnaissance: Military strength in various parts of South China, such as the distribution of garrison troops, the organization of popular armed forces, etc.</p>
<p>㊁ Investigation: National defense facilities, traffic conditions, military industrial conditions in various parts of South China, and efforts to sabotage them.</p>
<p>㊂ Purchase: Corrupt military and political personnel in the past, such as the remnants of the People's Government, and frustrated soldiers in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces.</p>
<p>㊃ Investigation and sabotage: Activities of party headquarters and mass organizations at all levels, and efforts to mobilize various unstable elements to sabotage anti-Japanese national salvation work.</p>
<p>㊄ Sowing dissension: Relations between the central government and the Southwest authorities, in order to shift the anti-Japanese sentiments of local authorities and figures.</p>
<p>㊅ Liaison with local: Treacherous merchants and profiteers, organizing smuggling organizations, implementing armed escort, giving merchants benefits, in order to establish faith in them among traitors and lackeys.</p>
<p>㊆ Use of legitimate Japanese and Korean merchants to go to the inland in the name of business to engage in espionage work.</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the activities of the agency have become more tense. It is now planned to intensify the training of traitorous elements and set up a lower-level cadre training class, concentrating traitors from various places for training in order to cope with major events in the future. The duration of this training is scheduled for two to three weeks, and participants are all confidantes and lackeys. The training subjects include intelligence techniques, detective skills, sabotage skills, disguise skills, social investigation, southern Chinese dialects, etc.</p>
<p>It is now heard that the head of the special agent organization, Oda, is the director of the class, and he has contacted Nanben, the head of the special agent organization in Shanghai, to discuss the dispatch of guidance personnel. Ono, a professor at the Shanghai Tongwen College, has been sent south to assist in the training. After this training is completed, they will be assigned to work in various locations.</p>
<p>The Japanese special agent organization's conspiracy in South China alone proves that the enemy's aggression is endless, and it is impossible to seek temporary peace. The flames of war in North China have already ignited. We can only retaliate with a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye to stop the enemy's ambition of aggression!</p>

<h3>Demand the Speedy Recovery of Lost Territories of Pingjin</h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>Also Mourning Generals Tong and Zhao</p>
<p>Tong Lingge, Deputy Commander of the 29th Army, and Zhao Dengyu, Commander of the 132nd Division, were both able to defeat the enemy in the Northern Expedition, bandit suppression, and Xifengkou campaigns, and made outstanding achievements. Unfortunately, in the Battle of Nanyuan the other day, Commander Zhao charged four times and died for his country. Commander Tong directed the killing of the enemy and was buried in artillery fire. Such loyal and brave generals who defended the country have become characters in historical biographies of loyalty, which is very regrettable. Now the National Government has issued a clear order to commend and posthumously award them the rank of General.</p>
<p>Now what our country needs most, lacks most, and values most is this kind of person. The loss of land can be recovered. The destruction of cultural institutions can be rebuilt. But this kind of loyal and brave general who defends the country is really not easy to obtain. Once they are gone, they are gone forever.</p>
<p>The enemy bombed Nankai University this time, destroying our cultural institutions. Their intention is indeed vicious and cruel. However, I still think it is not very important. The important point is not here. I mean the current problem, and also the most urgent problem, is the question of whether or not Pingjin can be recovered. Assuming Pingjin can be recovered, even if Nankai suffers a great loss now, there will still be a way to restore it afterward. Moreover, there are as many as six institutions of higher learning in Pingjin. Except for the two organized by foreigners, if Pingjin cannot be recovered, not only Nankai, but all other cultural institutions and people's land will fall into the hands of the enemy. Then our country's culture will completely become the enemy's culture. Our country's land and people will completely become the enemy's land and people. Then this time Nankai has no loss, what is there to be happy about? Moreover, taking Nankai as an example for Pingjin is really like one hair from nine oxen.</p>
<p>What a country depends on is land, people, and politics. But if there is land that cannot be defended, if there is politics but no one to govern, and if there are people but no one to manage, it cannot be regarded as a country. Now, although Pingjin has fallen, the officials are still officials, and they are still called officials of our country. The local institutions are still local institutions, and they are still called institutions of our people. What is missing? The reason for the fall of Pingjin this time is not the enemy's planes and cannons, but believing the words of these people. We should now recover the lost territories of Pingjin as soon as possible and eliminate the general mob, which is the most important task of our country's authorities, and it is also an inescapable task of our country's authorities. Now everything about public reason, justice, and humanity is out of the question. The period of arguing about right and wrong has passed. We only need to be united, to be in step, to be generous and excited, and to calmly kill the enemy. Anything else is empty talk. We do not talk about winning or losing now, nor do we talk about any sacrifices. We have reached the last step where we cannot retreat or give way. We only prepare to sacrifice and fight the enemy to the death.</p>
<p>A small victory is not worth rejoicing. A small defeat is not worth fearing. Life is only a hundred years. You die from scarlet fever, you die from cholera. The near ones are only a few years, the far ones are only a few decades, and eventually you will die. Death is originally an inescapable legal net of life. But there is a difference between dying for Mount Tai and dying for a feather. The blood of saving the country is the most honorable blood. It is the most valuable blood. It is the blood shed for the survival of our nation. Zhao Dengyu charged four times into the battle in airplanes and cannons, and the blood he shed. Tong Lingge supervised the battle in Nanyuan, and the blood he shed. And the blood shed by tens of thousands of soldiers at the front due to charging and fighting. How precious is this kind of blood? How valuable is it? We should burn incense and worship it. We should prostrate ourselves and weep bitterly. Then, although the bodies of Tong and Zhao are dead, their souls will not die. If the general traitors, running dogs, and those who sell their country for glory, their names may not be dead, but they are walking corpses. Their souls have long been exhausted, only to be spat upon by future generations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aggression Endangers World Peace</h3>
<p>I am in contact with relevant countries. Collective security is the only way to ensure safety.</p>
<p>[Paris] Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun said in an interview with the Associated Press today that "China has held talks with countries that have signed the Nine-Power Treaty. Now China can not only invoke the treaty, but also agree to this action. At present, the scope of the talks is still limited to soliciting the opinions of the signatory countries, and the countries naturally hope that Washington will take the lead. At the same time, China has also conducted discussions with relevant countries on the provisions of the League of Nations Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Japan's invasion of North China is a consistent policy since September 18, in order to encompass the Asian continent. Therefore, after North China, it will advance to Soviet Russia, and then to Central China, South China, and the Malay Peninsula and the Dutch East Indies. This war will affect the balance in the Pacific, and the United States will bear the brunt. China is determined to fight to the end and has now begun to implement wartime organizations. Since the world cannot be divided into independent regions, the war in the Far East is a problem for the whole world. Moreover, there is no real safety without collective security. I have talked to the French Foreign Minister many times. The French are very sympathetic, not only understanding the current situation, but also knowing the relationship between this war and the future of world peace." (National Telegram on the 30th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Observers here recently commented on the Spanish civil unrest, saying that the Spanish civil unrest has an impact on the dispute between China and Japan.

<h3>U.S. Senator Opposes the U.S. Implementing Neutrality Law</h3>
<p>This move does no harm to Japan; I fear it will easily lead to entanglement in the war.</p>
<p>[Washington] Senator Lewis today vigorously opposed the United States implementing neutrality laws for the Sino-Japanese crisis. Lewis said that if the United States implements this law, it can start a war with China or Japan, or even both China and Japan, within an hour. Those who demand the implementation of this law do not know that if the United States declares any country as an aggressor and recognizes that the two countries have officially started a war, then American merchant ships transporting goods to the Far East can be designated as supplying the enemy with military supplies and confiscated. American people will also be arrested and detained. At that time, the United States will inevitably use the Navy to rescue the lives and property of Americans, and thus start a war with China and Japan. Therefore, in order to avoid such incidents, the President must continue to try to persuade Spain and the parties to the conflict in the Far East to resume peace under appropriate conditions. (National Telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>[Washington] Today, the New York Times published a commentary entitled "American Foreign Policy," translated in full as follows:</p>
<p>Some members of the U.S. Congress are urging President Roosevelt to adopt the so-called 1937 Neutrality Act for the Far East incident. This law stipulates that the United States shall not supply weapons to warring countries and grants the President the prerogative to allow the export of other materials under the principle of cash purchase and self-transportation. In the past five months of 1937, the goods exported by the United States to China and Japan were worth a total of 165 million yuan, mostly cotton, scrap iron, and machinery. These kinds of goods can reasonably be considered materials used for war. If the President confirms that Asia has entered a state of war, then the cash purchase and self-transportation transaction will obviously be harmful to China and harmless to Japan. Because Japan has a large amount of gold and cash that can be used as cash, and has a large number of merchant ships for transportation, China's gold reserves are only one-third of Japan's, and it has no modern merchant ships and no modern navy to speak of. Therefore, if the neutrality law is really applied to the two major Asian countries, it will only be seen that it is not neutral. This result has nothing to do with the United States, because what the United States hopes for in the neutrality law is nothing more than to maintain its own position, regardless of other results. However, this kind of law is not only inconsistent with the principle of neutrality, but also cannot be implemented. The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Pittman, said that the President is now trying to protect American overseas Chinese in the Chinese war zone, but once the neutrality law is implemented, the President's power to mediate wars and protect American overseas Chinese will be immediately destroyed. In other words, it will only make the United States' position more dangerous. There is another point that Mr. Pittman has not mentioned, that is, the consistent U.S. foreign policy in the Far East is to maintain the integrity of China's territory and the open-door policy. In other words, all countries must have equal commercial opportunities in China. If the United States is isolated from international events due to the neutrality law, how can the U.S. foreign policy not be hindered? In short, if the United States is not prepared to safeguard its rights overseas, bear its responsibilities, and does not distinguish between the victim and the aggressor, it will reduce the strength of a major power in the world.

<h3>German and Russian Newspapers Comment on the Sino-Japanese Situation</h3>
<p>China wants to survive independently. Now is the time to exert its strength.</p>
<p>[Berlin] German newspapers are closely watching the situation in the Far East, believing that the resistance in North China is a symbol of the beginning of the evolution of the Chinese nation and also a manifestation of the restoration of China's vitality. At present, the Japanese army seems to have the upper hand, but it is still a question whether the Japanese soldiers are superior to the Chinese soldiers. The United Kingdom and the United States cannot protect China, and China must rely on its own physical strength and intelligence. It is not easy for Europeans to understand this kind of power. Only Germany has the same experience. For two thousand years, the German nation has often exerted its own power to maintain its survival. China has also always maintained its self-confidence. Today, China has begun to resist. The future status of European countries in Asia depends on the understanding and appreciation of China's revival. (Haitong Telegram on the 31st)</p>
<h3>Japan Uses Anti-Communism as a Pretext to Conceal its Aggression Against China</h3>
<p>[Moscow] "Pravda" commented on the situation in North China, saying, "The Japanese warlords have decided to turn North China into a second 'Manchukuo.' This is an opportune moment. The world knows the Japanese methods of aggression. First, they create 'incidents,' then they send troops to suppress them, and finally they massacre civilians and occupy neighboring countries' land. The development of the North China Incident makes the whole world deeply understand that the so-called anti-communist movement of the Japanese is actually all about occupying the territory of neighboring countries."</p>
<p>The newspaper continued to comment on Hirota's speech on the Sino-Japanese dispute, saying, "Mr. Hirota is not unaware that the Chinese people will never extend their necks to be slaughtered by Japanese imperialism, but he still pretends to be calm, and can completely determine that the capitalist countries concerned with interests in China, especially the United Kingdom, will sit idly by and not ask questions about the aggression, and then he will make a great statement. Hirota's speech proves that Japan's policy has not changed at all, and it is still following the orders of the warlords." The newspaper also commented on the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, saying, "The Soviet government has long expressed to the Japanese side its willingness to organize a committee to resolve border disputes and a border survey committee, and requested that the current border stipulated in the Beijing and Fengtian Treaties be respected before the border survey, but the Japanese side ignored it rudely, and the committee has not been organized so far."</p>
<p>Pravda concluded, "The speeches made by the Japanese Cabinet in the special parliament prove that the country's foreign policy has not changed at all since the 'September 18th' incident. Western European politicians once thought that Sato's assumption of the post of foreign minister had eased the Japanese policy, which was completely wrong." (TASS Telegram on the 31st)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] The Chinese Women's Association for Comforting and Defending the Resistance Soldiers, organized by Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, held its inaugural meeting at the Lizi Society in Beijing at 4:00 PM on the 1st. About 700 representatives from various agencies attended. The meeting was chaired by Madame Chiang, who gave an opening speech. Then Wu Yifang reported on the preparations for the association, and then discussions began. The organizational outline of the association and the list of executive and supervisory committee members were unanimously adopted. Fifteen people, including Madame Soong Mei-ling, Ms. Li Dequan, Ms. Shen Huilian, and Ms. Wu Yifang, were elected as executive committee members.

After the meeting, the first executive committee meeting was held, and Madame Chiang, Madame Feng, Madame Ma Chaojun, and Madame Luo Jialun were elected as standing committee members, and many other important cases were passed. Madame Chiang's speech briefly stated, "Dear comrades, we are meeting here today, at a time when a strong neighbor is pressing on the border, which can be said to be the most serious and critical moment in history, because war is a dangerous and hateful thing. In this war, we will have to sacrifice many officers, soldiers, and civilians, and lose countless national properties and resources. It is foreseeable that our ten years of hard work will be destroyed by this very brutal enemy. But for the life of the country, sometimes we need such extreme sacrifices. Our government's attitude has now been clearly expressed. Everything that a nation with self-respect can endure, we have already endured. We must not hesitate any longer, but move forward bravely and use all our strength to save the country from danger. We and the people of the country must absolutely obey the orders of the government and unite to seek the final victory of the nation. We must protect the integrity of the country and the lives of the nation, and we should do everything we can to resist the enemy's aggression. We women are also a part of the nation. Although our positions, abilities, and the things that we can contribute are different, everyone should contribute her ability to save the country as much as possible. Today, the women of Spain are standing on the front line like men. During the European War, the women of various countries did their best to help their countries and achieved victory. We Chinese female compatriots must show the world our patriotic spirit. The purpose of today's meeting is that we want to unite and organize. We are not trying to show off or seek false fame, but to save the life of the country. I hope that everyone can practically take on the work and do their best. During the war, men have to go to the front line to kill the enemy, and rear area work is the responsibility of our women. We need to encourage the men, so that they know that we have our ways to support them, so that they have no worries, not to hinder them. We can also sacrifice everything, even our lives, to support our loyal and brave soldiers at the front. I know that various women's organizations have already begun to organize. We are preparing to do the work. I hope we can all unite together and succeed in a large organization, so that our strength will be even stronger. True unity is strength. The courage of the soldiers at the front all depends on the support of the rear. We must never forget, and we should always keep in mind, that the final victory of the country, no matter how long it is delayed, will eventually be achieved. We will definitely be able to sweep away the national humiliations piled on our hearts day by day." (Central News Agency Telegram on the 1st)</p>

<p>⊙ Montfaucon, France: The U.S. government recently built a memorial here to commemorate the American Expeditionary Force's First Army soldiers who died in the advance on German troops from the Argonne Forest during the European War. The unveiling ceremony was held today, presided over by French President Lebrun. Premier Chautemps, Foreign Minister Delbos, former Minister of War, renowned general of the European War, Marshal Pétain, U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt, and U.S. Expeditionary Force Commander General Pershing all attended the ceremony. All parties expressed their aversion to war and opposition to aggression. Ambassador Bullitt's speech stated, "We should strive for peace. France and the United States cooperated twice during the American Revolutionary War and the European War, and both times achieved victory. Now we should strive for victory for peace." General Pershing then delivered a speech, recounting the events of the Argonne Forest campaign, stating that "Such recollections can make people resent war. As a result of the European War, no party benefited, but rather left behind many problems that cannot be resolved, and cannot be resolved by war. Today, countries around the world are engaged in an arms race, which is in full swing. If this madness is not treated, then another world war will soon break out, and Western civilization will inevitably be destroyed." U.S. President Roosevelt also delivered a radio broadcast speech from Washington, stating, "The purpose of the U.S. participation in the war was to uphold democratic ideals. We still adhere to these ideals, and to state them cautiously, France and the United States do not desire to conquer territory, and are willing to live in peace with other countries, and in friendship with all freedom-loving nations."

<h3>German Fleet Rotation in Spanish Waters</h3>

<p>[London] After the subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War failed to reach a compromise in its meeting the day before yesterday, experts from the British Foreign Office are studying the situation after the committee's failure. French Ambassador Corbin met with Sir Monsey, head of the Spanish Department of the Foreign Office, for a long time yesterday afternoon. British Acting Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax is reportedly engaging in talks with the ambassadors of Germany, Italy, and Russia, striving to mediate so that the subcommittee will not fall into deadlock again and will be able to achieve something when it continues to meet on the 5th of this month. Regarding this matter, Portuguese Foreign Minister Monteiro gave a speech yesterday stating that the recognition of both sides of the Spanish Civil War as belligerents could be implemented even if Soviet Russia did not agree. Diplomatic circles here are commenting that all resolutions of the Mediation Committee have always been adopted unanimously before they are established. Now, if action is taken regardless of Soviet Russia's opposition, it would be abandoning this principle. However, if the Soviet government, despite not accepting the recognition of both sides of the Spanish Civil War as belligerents by the other twenty-six member states of the Mediation Committee in accordance with the conditions contained in the British compromise plan, is still willing to continue to participate in the non-intervention policy, then a solution will be easier to find. In short, if all efforts fail, the Mediation Committee will only be able to convene a plenary meeting to decide to extend the subcommittee's meeting for one month to allow representatives from various countries to spend the summer vacation, or even to admit failure and declare failure. In that case, Foreign Secretary Eden's declaration in the House of Commons that the British and French governments should consult with each other to decide on countermeasures will then be put into practice. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the British compromise plan on non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, Britain, France, and Russia have all submitted replies. Diplomatic circles here are commenting that the replies from Britain, France, and Russia only differ slightly in degree. Regarding the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, Soviet Russia advocates recognizing both sides of the Spanish Civil War as belligerents only after the complete withdrawal, while Britain and France advocate recognizing belligerency after "substantial progress" has been made in the withdrawal. Although the Soviet government has stated that it does not want to grant belligerent rights to the Spanish Nationalist government under any circumstances, this reply is more moderate, perhaps due to French Foreign Minister Delbos's advice to Soviet Russia. As for Soviet Russia's claim that the Moroccan natives belonging to the Nationalist forces should also be regarded as foreign volunteers, France cannot agree to this, which is due to France's possession of colonies. French officials also said regarding this</p>
<h3>Britain and Italy Share Desire to Improve Relations</h3>
<p>Exchange of Letters Between Prime Ministers; Contents Currently Kept Strictly Secret</p>
<p>[London] After Prime Minister Chamberlain held talks with Italian Ambassador Grandi on the 27th of last month to discuss the issue of improving relations, it was rumored that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had received or would receive a handwritten letter from Prime Minister Chamberlain, but this could not be confirmed. Political circles here were very interested upon hearing the news, believing that Prime Minister Mussolini had sent a private letter to London, and this letter from Prime Minister Chamberlain was to reciprocate. In short, the exchange of letters shows that both sides have the desire to improve relations. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 1st)</p>
<p>[Rome] It is confirmed here that after British Prime Minister Chamberlain's meeting with Italian Ambassador Grandi, Chamberlain's personal handwritten letter to Mussolini has been handed over to Grandi and has been sent to Rome by diplomatic personnel.

<p>[Washington] According to authoritative sources today, when the American members of the joint Philippine-U.S. Expert Committee travel to Manila to investigate, they will study in detail the attitude of the Filipino people themselves towards the issue of independence. Senior U.S. officials still do not believe that the general public in the Philippines wants early independence. For example, when the market in Manila hears news that is favorable to early independence, prices fall, and when there is news to the contrary, they rise again. This situation is quite noteworthy.

<h3>Japanese Residents in Hankou Form Committee on the Situation</h3>
<p>Also Forms a Civilian Police Force and Intelligence Division; Japanese Soldiers Continue to Arrive in Hankou, Japanese Dependents Travel to Shanghai</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Japanese concession in Hankou has declared martial law since the outbreak of the Battle of Pingjin. Acting Consul General Tadayuki Matsudaira has repeatedly visited our military and political authorities to request the protection of Japanese residents. Our authorities, due to their naval and land defenses being in a complete state of war, reportedly made reasonable expressions regarding their demands. However, Matsudaira has held security meetings with the chairman of the Japanese Residents Association, Mr. Yasutomo, and important Japanese business leaders for several consecutive days, resolving to organize a Committee on the Situation. The committee held its first meeting at the Tongren Hospital on the 31st, electing Matsudaira as chairman. They hold meetings and have candid discussions every day. In addition, the Japanese residents have organized a civilian police force to assist the Japanese military police in defending the Japanese concession. An intelligence division has also been established to investigate our actions. The Japanese warships anchored on the river are under the command of Commander of the Naval Landing Force, Mataro Tanemoto. On the 31st, another destroyer, the Kuri, arrived in Hankou carrying 130 soldiers. It is heard that more Japanese soldiers will continue to arrive to reinforce the defenses. The Japanese are so overly nervous, claiming it is to protect Japanese residents, but in reality, the number of Japanese in Hubei Province, including Yichang, Shashi, and Huangshigang, totals only 1,340. Most of them have already returned to their country. Even in Hankou, there are not many Japanese women and children left. Even Matsudaira's family members took a boat to Shanghai on the 31st. In terms of merchants, the Nisshin Steamship Company received orders from its head office on the 29th to end its business within 48 hours and completed it on the 31st. Chinese employees were completely dismissed. Taian Spinning Mill, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and both foreign firms are also preparing to temporarily suspend operations or reduce their scope. Both authoritative financial institutions, the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Taiwan, have changed their business direction. For example, they originally adopted an unlimited exchange rate policy for foreign exchange, but now they have automatically changed. Customers who buy foreign exchange must specify the purpose or purchase goods to be shipped to Japan or Hankou before they are allowed to purchase it, otherwise they will be rejected. Other small and medium-sized shops are buying rice and military raw materials, such as broken cotton batting, sand, gravel, scrap copper, scrap iron, etc. It is said that this is a secret order from the military, but because our people have been deeply stimulated and have automatically severed trade, their results are very poor.</p>
<p>The Yuehan Railway Bureau recently uncovered a traitorous organization. After interrogation, it was learned that they were bought by the enemy and attempted to sabotage transportation. The railway bureau then convened a road protection meeting, organized a secret patrol team, and strictly protected the road. On the 31st, ten articles of strict prevention of traitors were announced and circulated throughout the railway for implementation (July 31st).</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul in Zhengzhou Intensifies Espionage Work</h3>
<p>Commands Traitors to Contact Bandits; Japanese Aircraft Arrive in Henan for Reconnaissance and Bombing</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Correspondence: Since Consul Sasaki came to Zhengzhou to resume activities last year, the Japanese consulate in Zhengzhou has been using his diplomatic position to carry out espionage work and secretly instigating Japanese and Korean ruffians to smuggle and sell drugs. In February of this year, after our police bureau uncovered the Japanese special agent agency stationed in Zhengzhou, the Japanese side found it difficult to carry out activities here. Therefore, Mstaro Matsui, a member of the consulate, rented a residence in Datong Hutong and took direct responsibility. However, Matsui was pretending to learn Chinese and living in Zhengzhou. Because of our strict precautions, it was inconvenient to carry out espionage activities such as buying traitors and gathering military intelligence. Therefore, the Fuku-Sho foreign company, the main smuggling base of the Japanese in Zhengzhou, was used as a traffic point for the special agent agency, and the Guangren Hospital was used as a liaison point for buying traitors and colluding with bandits. However, because our customs set up an inspection office in Zhengzhou, smuggling goods gradually disappeared, and the foreign company stopped operating. The Guangren Hospital was also sealed off due to the Dong Fangcheng case. The Japanese side found that its activities in Zhengzhou had been repeatedly uncovered, so the North China Japanese Garrison changed its personnel and sent Shigeo Masuda to Zhengzhou to continue working under the guise of learning Chinese and urge Matsui to work. Masuda was soon transferred back by the Japanese Garrison, and Kō Narita was sent to Zhengzhou instead. Before the July 7th Incident, Consul Sasaki personally went to Hankou to discuss with the Japanese Consul General stationed in Hankou the methods of advancing the special agent work in Zhengzhou, and sent students from the Shanghai Tongwen Academy to travel to Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Xuzhou, and Luoyang under the guise of travel to spy on the terrain and instruct traitors to act. However, Mstaro Matsui's stay in China (ten months) had long expired, so on July 20th, he led the members of the consulate, such as Mr. Ozawa, Mr. Iiyama, and Mr. Yamano, and several dependents from Zhengzhou to Hankou and then took a boat to return home. The remaining special agent work is now the responsibility of Mr. Narita. According to reliable sources, since the July 7th Incident, the consulate in Zhengzhou has had frequent communications with Pingjin, Qingdao, Hankou, and other places, and the text, in addition to using codes, is composed of the text of English, French, German, Japanese and other countries. The content is extremely secret.</p>
<p>On July 20th, Japanese aircraft were spotted in the sky over Anyang in northern Henan, reconnoitering. This was the first time that Japanese aircraft had invaded the airspace of Henan. They also strafed the Shuangmiao station on the Zhanghe River on the border of Hebei and Henan with machine guns, causing heavy losses to our side. After the aircraft strafed the high altitude in Shuangmiao, they flew to the Guandian and Gaopailou stations and strafed the 72nd passenger and freight train on the Pinghan Railway with machine guns, killing and wounding more than ten passengers and soldiers. Dozens of villagers and farmers nearby who were walking on the road or collecting crops in the fields were also wounded or killed by the bullets. Since the airspace of Henan was invaded by Japanese aircraft on the 20th, Zheng City, as an important hub for transportation and military affairs, and the Pinghan Railway Bridge across the Yellow River, should be the target of Japanese reconnaissance and bombing. Therefore, on July 22, 23, 26, etc., Japanese aircraft were found to be reconnoitering at high altitudes at about 3:00 PM. In particular, the reconnaissance aircraft on the 26th was flying at an altitude of only 2,000 meters above Zhengzhou. The red sun emblem under the wings of the aircraft was very conspicuous. It made a low-altitude reconnaissance of our airfield for about five minutes before heading west. At 4:55 PM that afternoon, it arrived in Luoyang, circled five times over the Xigong and the station in the city, and then flew east to reconnoiter over the sky of Xiaoyi County for a week before flying north across the river. It is heard that when Japanese aircraft are flying over Zhengzhou, they must circle over the Yellow River Railway Bridge several times and conduct low-altitude reconnaissance. In view of the Japanese aircraft's invasion of our high altitude, all circles in Zhengzhou urgently need to carry out air defense equipment. Therefore, the Air Defense Headquarters urged the various defense countries to step up organization and training.</p>
<h3>福州日台僑民開始撤退</h3>
<p>Taiwanese divided into three groups to depart, Japanese to retreat by one-third first.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Following the outbreak of war in Hebei, Japanese and Taiwanese residents in Fuzhou have taken special actions. Recently, the opium dens opened by Taiwanese still operate as usual during the day, but have stopped accommodating guests overnight. High-interest loans, totaling more than 100,000 yuan, have been halted, and collection has become strict, with some resorting to armed debt collection. Borrowers requesting extensions have been denied, and some have even been injured. After negotiations by the authorities, this trend has subsided. On the evening of July 29th, representatives of Japanese and Taiwanese residents held a meeting at the Resident Association in Cangshan. Uchida, the Consul-General in Fujian, also attended to give instructions regarding the evacuation plan for the residents. Due to the large number of Taiwanese, they will be divided into three groups. The first group, consisting of women and children, will depart on the Shengjing Maru ship on the 31st. The second group will be teachers and doctors, and the third group will be merchants, who will decide whether to proceed based on the situation. The Japanese plan to retreat by one-third first, consisting of those without important positions. The rest will remain in Fujian temporarily to handle business. Although Fuzhou has declared martial law after midnight, local order remains stable. Chen Yi, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, convened a meeting on the 30th with the heads of the Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction departments, as well as the heads and deputy heads of the Security Bureau and the Water and Land Police Bureau, to discuss and coordinate all measures to stabilize the local situation. However, in the business sector, due to the escalating war in Hebei, exports of tea, timber, and other specialties have been halted, and it is difficult to repatriate funds from Tianjin and Qingdao, resulting in a tight credit situation. Although various money houses have provided an additional 300,000 yuan in credit loans beyond the existing amounts to facilitate circulation, it is still insufficient. The exchange rate of money house promissory notes for legal tender has risen from one yuan to ten yuan per thousand. Currently, various merchant guilds are requesting the provincial government to negotiate with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to jointly raise one million yuan for unsecured loans to businesses to provide relief, but it is unknown whether this can be realized.

<h3>湖北農村雜寫</h3>
<h3>Rural Notes from Hubei</h3>
<p>— Cheng Jun</p>
<p>Qichun's specialties and Wuxue's brothels</p>
<p>Traveling one hundred and eighty li from Echeng to Qichun, the county town is built facing the river and backed by mountains, more majestic than the stone city of Echeng. It was a "lu" during the Lu dynasty, a "fu" during the Ming dynasty, a "zhou" during the Qing dynasty, and a "xian" during the Republic of China. The entire territory covers an area of one hundred and thirty "li" wide and two hundred and fifty "li" long, with a population of approximately five hundred thousand. The main agricultural product is rice, followed by hemp and cotton, then soybeans, wheat, sesame, and tea. There are also many secondary products such as radishes, peanuts, melon seeds, fragrant wood, and leather oil. There are also famous specialties: Qichun snake, Qichun turtle, and Qichun mugwort. Qichun snake is also known as white flower snake, produced in both Sichuan and Hubei provinces. When steeped in wine, it can cure diseases. However, only the one produced in Qichun is the true Qichun snake, with the most miraculous effect and a strong reputation. Qichun turtle is the green-haired turtle, with green hair on its back, and is considered a top-grade tonic. Qichun mugwort can also be used to make medicine.</p>
<p>The county is bordered by the river to the south and mostly mountainous to the north. Floods and droughts are difficult to avoid. Therefore, there is a Water Conservancy Committee and sub-committees responsible for repairing dikes, embankments, ponds, and weirs. However, upon closer examination, they have not been able to fully fulfill their duties. Floods and droughts are still inevitable. Those who hold empty titles but lack practical benefits are numerous. It is not necessary to deeply criticize this committee.</p>
<p>Education funding is more abundant than in other counties. There are over ten thousand dan of rented grains, as well as surcharges on land tax, deed tax, slaughter tax, hemp donation, and rice export registration fees, yielding over twenty thousand yuan annually, so there is no shortage of funds. In addition to the Qimin Middle School run by the church, there is a district-run normal school, a county-run central primary school, and a complete primary school, which are able to develop evenly. Furthermore, large clans and wealthy families have very abundant ancestral properties. They have followed government guidance and allocated three-tenths to four-tenths of their ancestral properties as funds to establish clan schools. A total of one hundred and eighty-three schools have been established, each with its own clan school committee to manage everything. The scale is now roughly in place. However, the Lianbao primary schools are mostly nominal and need to be improved. I stayed in Qichun for one day and went to Wuxue, ninety "li" away, which took two and a half hours to reach. This place belongs to Guangji County. Because the Kanshui River converges here, it is also called Kanjiang, a famous market town on the Yangtze River. To the north, one "gan li" away, is Pan Kui City, named after Fan Kuai who was ordered by Emperor Gaozu of Han to build a city and garrison troops when he was conquering Ying Bu. To the east is Tianjia Town, a dangerous point on the Yangtze River. The words "Yangtze River Key" and "Iron Chain Across the River" are engraved on the stone wall, but they are covered by moss and not easily recognizable. It is said that they are relics of Wu Emperor Hao of the Three Kingdoms when he was defending against the Jin troops. The so-called "thousand-foot iron chain sunk to the bottom of the river" probably refers to this. During the Taiping Rebellion, Hong Yang also used iron chains and rafts to block the river here. The Qing army conquered it only after a hundred battles. In times of war, being able to defend but not attack is fundamentally a poor strategy. Even a dangerous place is ultimately useless. Moreover, being unable to defend at all, even with open gates, is even worse than Sun Hao and Hong Yang.</p>
<p>Wuxue's streets are narrow and not very clean. The sewers are clogged, there are many toilets, garbage is thrown everywhere, and residents raise pigs, allowing them to defecate and urinate anywhere on the streets, which is very detrimental to hygiene. In a large market town with a population of twenty thousand, if this is not corrected immediately, the harm will be incalculable.</p>
<p>Brothels are numerous, divided into public and private brothels. Public brothels are further divided into the Yangzhou and Benbang factions. The Yangzhou faction has Ruyi Hall, Yuelai Hall, Fenglai Hall, Gaolai Hall, and Tan Da Hall. The Benbang faction has Si Xi Hall and Huang Da Fang, totaling seven halls with thirty-four prostitutes. Private brothels are almost everywhere. According to a police station investigation, the city's population is twenty thousand, with over three thousand widowers. It is likely that this is why it can accommodate a large number of prostitutes. However, in recent years, the market has been sluggish, and those who spend lavishly on entertainment feel strained. Therefore, the prostitutes' business is not as good as before. The Yangzhou faction charges higher fees for nighttime services, intending to increase their status, but because few patrons inquire, they have had to greatly reduce their prices. Most of these prostitutes come from Hankou, because business is not good there, so they move here. Who knew that under the same economic decline, it is still not easy to make a living. Their situation is pitiful. As for the large number of private prostitutes, half are due to economic pressure, and half are due to excessive licentiousness. The facts are as they are. There is no need to avoid discussing it in depth.</p>

<p>Obtaining Raw Materials for Exported Gunpowder</p>
<p>The Fourth District Office of Jiangdu reported that rags, old cotton, etc., can all be used as raw materials for gunpowder, and was ordered to investigate and prohibit outward transportation. Recently, many more wasteland goods shops have suddenly appeared in Xianzhen, buying and selling waste copper, scrap iron, and rags for outward transportation and sale to foreign firms. On the 31st, boatman Cui Anfu transported a large batch of rags for wasteland goods shops Xu Defu and Zhao Guolin to the Longzhang Factory in Shanghai for sale. He was detained and reported to the county for instructions. The county government immediately ordered the boatman and shop owner to be brought to court. They both admitted to transporting goods to Shanghai, but did not admit to contacting foreigners. They were ordered to be detained by the political and police room pending investigation.</p>

<p>The Qingchun Silk Weaving Factory at No. 6 Xiaofuqing Lane in Hangzhou City caught fire at 1:05 AM on the 1st due to a short circuit in the installed motor. The fire quickly spread, and the fire brigade and fire rescue association rushed to the scene to put it out. It took half an hour to extinguish. More than forty motors in the factory were completely burned. The nearby Mei Yue Jingwei Factory was also affected. The total loss of the two factories reached 100,000 yuan. Gu Hexian, a manager of the Qingchun Factory, was unable to escape due to the intense fire and perished in the flames. The court has been notified to send personnel to inspect the coffin. Also, a fire broke out on Yuefen Street in West Lake at 5:00 AM on the 1st, destroying four houses. Fortunately, it was quickly extinguished.</p>

Decisions have been made immediately. It is reported that Japanese warships were discovered fifteen "li" from the sea off Zhapu two weeks ago, surveying the harbor terrain. They left for other destinations two days later. Military and police authorities are closely watching for traitors to maintain local security.</p>

<p>Descendants Rob Ancestral Graves</p>
<p>There is an ancient Zheng family tomb in the Banpu Dawu grave area in Cixi South, which is said to be the tomb of Zheng Shangshu during the Song Dynasty. Because he was slandered, he was tragically executed. When the injustice was redressed, his head could not be found, so a gold head was sculpted for reburial. Now, Zheng Zishe, a descendant of the Zheng family, is poor and destitute, and hired someone to excavate the Zheng tomb in order to obtain the gold head, but he found nothing.</p>

<p>The Yellow Sand and Crushed Stone Industry Association of this city stated that the industry has always had two major gangs, one from Ningbo and one from Jiangbei, and the laborers hired by both gangs are from Jiangbei. These people are simple-minded and have no food reserves at home. If war breaks out, the lives of these more than 500 people will become a problem. Under the pressure of life, taking risks is expected. Therefore, it is necessary to plan for coping measures in advance. After the committee members of the association exchanged opinions, they believed that if these laborers cannot maintain their livelihoods, there is a possibility of being used by the enemy. It was decided to form these laborers into a wartime engineering service corps, and when the artillery fire sounds, they will all be moved to the rear to help our army build fortifications.</p>

<h3>Third Japanese Fleet Holds Consecutive Meetings</h3>
<p>The "Kuri" to Return to Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>The "Kuri," a destroyer belonging to the Second Japanese Fleet stationed in Shanghai, recently transported 300 marines and military supplies from Shanghai to Hankou to reinforce defenses. According to Japanese naval sources, the vessel has completed its mission and is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Hankou tomorrow, presumably for a second round of transportation. Furthermore, according to reporter inquiries, Admiral Hasegawa, commander of the Third Fleet, has been holding meetings for days aboard the "Izumo" with naval attaché Tadao Honda, "Izumo" captain Iwamura, naval assistant attaché Mamoru, special naval landing force commander Ouchi Denhichi, and others. As a result of these meetings, strict and concrete decisions have been made regarding military affairs in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and in Shanghai. Therefore, the recent flurry of movement among Japanese warships stationed in Shanghai is a step in implementing this defense plan.</p>

<h3>Chu Minyi Discusses Central Government's Preparations</h3>
<p>Top Officials Completely United in Their Will to Resist　Third Lushan Talks Cancelled</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Executive Committee, arrived in Shanghai by car at 7 a.m. yesterday to handle enrollment matters for the Sino-French National Institute of Technology and returned to Nanjing that evening. According to Chu, since the September 18th Incident, the central government has resolved not to lose another inch of territory, having prepared for six years. This is common knowledge. Unexpectedly, Japan has resorted to old tricks again, with the situation in Peiping and Tianjin changing abruptly, forcing our nation to a final crossroads. Currently, there is no alternative but to resist; otherwise, only destruction awaits. The central government has made various emergency preparations, and the top officials are completely united in their will to resist. Chairman Wang's return to Nanjing from Lushan is to discuss major plans with other key figures at any time. Although Wang's health is not good due to overwork, he is extremely excited and disregards his personal health, not wishing to come to Shanghai for an examination. As for the third Lushan talks, which were originally scheduled to be postponed, it has now been decided to cancel them.</p>
<h3>Shen Junru and Six Others Arrive in Shanghai from Suzhou After Being Released on Bail</h3>
<p>Issued Joint Statement on Train　Will Travel to Nanjing in the Shortest Time</p>
<p>Shen Junru and six others, who had been detained in Suzhou on suspicion of endangering the Republic of China, were released on bail the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at approximately 11 a.m. on a Shanghai-Changzhou express train. Shen's relatives and friends hosted a banquet for the seven at the Dengtuomo Hotel at noon. It is reported that Shen and others will travel to Nanjing within days. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Shen Junru, Sha Qianli, Li Gongpu, Zhang Naiqi, Wang Zaoshi, Shi Liang, Zou Taofen, and six others have been detained since last year, a period of eight months. Hearings have been held repeatedly, but they remained in custody because the evidence needed further investigation. Now, Shen and others applied to the Suzhou High Court to end their detention, which was approved. They were released on bail the day before yesterday. Shen and the others arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at approximately 11 a.m. Because very few outsiders knew in advance, only Shen's family members were at the station to welcome them. After arriving in Shanghai, they all returned to their private residences to rest. They will rest briefly in Shanghai and travel to Nanjing in the short term.</p>
<p>Joint Statement</p>
<p>According to a joint statement issued by Shen and the others upon their arrival, "When we were released from prison, we telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing to request instructions on everything. Because the reply telegram had not yet arrived, and because there are many relatives and friends in Suzhou, staying for another day would only cause more trouble for them, so we took the opportunity to return to Shanghai first. We will depart for Nanjing as soon as we receive the reply telegram. We did not notify relatives and friends in Shanghai in advance, but many have received news from Suzhou and came to the station to greet us, which makes us feel very uneasy. As for the current situation, we have only had two main points in the past: one is unity, that is, a united front of the entire nation, and the other is resistance to Japan. At present, national unity already has a solid foundation, and resistance to Japan has become the unanimous demand of the entire nation. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the central government, a great national liberation war will surely unfold, and final victory will surely be achieved. We can only prepare everything and fulfill our duty as citizens in the national liberation war."</p>
<p>Banquet with Relatives and Friends</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., more than a hundred people, including Zhang Zhirang and Hu Yuzhi, held a welcoming banquet for Shen and the others at the Dengtuomo Hotel. During the banquet, Shen and the others expressed their opinions and thanks one after another. The guests and hosts dispersed happily at around 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Petition for the Release of Sun and Cao</p>
<p>Sun Xiaocun, section chief of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Cao Mengjun, first-class clerk of the Agriculture Department of the Ministry of Industry, were detained by the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters six days after Shen Junru and others were arrested (November 28 of last year) for participating in the national salvation movement. It has been eight months, and they have not yet been transferred to the court. Now that Shen Junru and others have regained their freedom, Sun Xiaocun and others are still nowhere to be heard from. Even their families have not been allowed to meet with them. It is reported that their families and close friends, Chen Gaoyong, Chen Zhigao, Lin Xichun, Shi Zhecun, and Wu Gengmei, have submitted petitions to the Central Party Headquarters, the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters, and other places, requesting their early release. The Shanghai Editors Association and the Chinese Rural Economic Research Association, noting Sun's contributions to cultural work and rural revitalization, also plan to appeal to the authorities. The former has already appointed Zhang Zhirang, a director of the association, to draft a petition to the authorities requesting their release. The latter has appointed Feng Hefa, Xue Muqiao, and other directors of the association to go to Nanjing to petition the party and government authorities.</p>

<h3>Female and High School Students in Training Group Depart</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Encourages Acquisition of Military Knowledge　Director Tang's Realistic and Substantial Three-Point Instructions</p>
<p>The Shanghai 26th Year Student Centralized Training Corps held a departure ceremony for the female military nursing training team at 7 a.m. yesterday at the Zhongzheng Camp in Huacao Town, west of Shanghai. At the same time, the high school centralized training students also held their graduation ceremony and review ahead of schedule yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reviewing Officer</p>
<p>Those in attendance included the reviewing officer, Mayor Yu Hongjun; Zhu Xia, representative of Police Garrison Commander Yang Hu; Police Chief Cai Jingjun; Security Regiment Commander Ji Zhangjian; accompanying reviewing officers Tao Yishan and Wang Shaozhai; evaluation officers Sun Yan, Zhou Songping, Zhou Daming, and Wang Pingruo; and students' families and various schools Sun Kangzeng, Zhang Xiangwen, and the entire student body, totaling over two thousand people. The ceremony was presided over by Li Xiangqi, chairman of the training corps, with Luo Kelun, deputy silk corps leader, serving as review commander.</p>
<p>Conducting Exercises</p>
<p>At 7 a.m. sharp, the ceremony began. First, the commander reported on the program of exercises, followed by the start of the review and exercises. The items were: ㊁ Raising the flag, ㊁ Parade, ㊂ Divisional march, ㊃ Battalion drill, ㊄ Platoon drill, ㊅ Acrobatics, ㊆ Gymnastics, ㊇ Formation spelling exercise by the female team, ㊈ Platoon confrontation, ㊉ Firefighting exercise, ㊉㊁ First aid exercise. Among these, the platoon confrontation was particularly realistic, and the firefighting and first aid exercises were the most skilled and agile.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>At 10 a.m., after the exercises were completed, the ceremony began. After performing the rituals, Chairman Li Xiangqi first reported, stating in brief, "Today is the departure ceremony for the 26th Year Centralized Training Corps' military nursing training team, and at the same time, the graduation ceremony for the high school centralized training students is being held ahead of schedule today. We are very honored to have Mayor Yu, Commander Yang's representative, and other officials and guests from all walks of life participating. Taking this opportunity of holding the graduation ceremony, I will briefly report on the significance of national military training. National military training is divided into three types: ㊀ National physical education, ㊁ Social military training (i.e., Shanghai's civic training), ㊂ School military training. Currently, the implementation of the first two is not yet widespread, and the effectiveness is not yet obvious. Only the third item, school military training, has achieved considerable results since its implementation in the 18th year of the Republic. In addition to regular military training in schools, there is also a centralized training session. This year, because Shanghai built its own barracks, the entry time into the camp is the same, but the departure time is slightly different. A total of four departure ceremonies will be held for this army. Today is the departure ceremony for the female team and high school centralized training. The high school centralized training students were originally scheduled to hold the departure ceremony on August 10th. Now, in order to save time and resources, it is being held simultaneously with the female team today. Furthermore, he praised the hard work and excellent performance of the female nursing team, noting that the members of the female nursing team are all female students from various schools who participated voluntarily."</p>
<p>Chairman's Instructions</p>
<p>Then, Zhu Xia, the representative of Commander Yang, read Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, which stated in essence, "In ancient China, both literary and martial arts were cultivated. In later generations, literary and martial arts diverged, and the nation became weak and the national strength declined. Now, to correct this error, it is necessary to equip the general public and young students with the necessary modern military knowledge and skills."</p>
<p>Director's Instructions</p>
<p>Then, Cai Jingjun, the representative of Training Director Tang Shengzhi, read the instructions, which stated in brief, "At the last entry ceremony, I spoke with you about the significance of student centralized training, which is to understand shame and teach war. Today, I will take the opportunity of holding the departure ceremony to reiterate the following points that I hope you will earnestly enrich yourselves with in the future: ㊀ Cultivate morality, ㊁ Seek knowledge, ㊂ Strengthen your bodies. Finally, I sincerely hope that from now on, you will accept the Prime Minister's will and follow the leader's instructions, and diligently practice what you have been taught in the centralized training corps, so that the national shame of China will surely be washed away one day."</p>
<p>Mayor's Instructions</p>
<p>Then, Mayor Yu delivered instructions, stating in brief, "In today's severe national crisis, holding this centralized training departure ceremony is of great and far-reaching significance. Today, no one does not feel sorrow and responsibility for this severe national crisis. However, mere sorrow and hatred are of no avail, and knowing the heavy responsibility alone is also useless. It is necessary to prepare earnestly for how to shoulder this responsibility so that we can all go to the national crisis and save the country. You have all received thorough training and recognition in physical fitness, mental cultivation, and militarized life, which I need not elaborate on. Here, I respectfully hope that you will remember and be able to earnestly achieve the three phrases: 'Wealth and nobility cannot corrupt, poverty and meanness cannot move, and power and force cannot subdue.'"</p>
<p>Student's Response</p>
<p>Then, Zhu Xia, the representative of Commander Yang, Sun Yuanzeng, the school representative, and Zhang Xiangwen, the family representative, delivered instructions. The chairman gave a response, hoping that the departing students would ㊀ determine their outlook on life, ㊁ achieve what Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "Labor, creation, mutual assistance," ㊂ continue to maintain their natural fighting spirit, and ㊂ strive towards the goal of resisting aggression and defending against insults. Finally, Zhou Yinglong, the high school student representative, and Zhou Yueying, the female team student representative, delivered responses. At 11 a.m., after shouting slogans and taking photos, the ceremony was adjourned.</p>
<h3>US Treasury Department Representative Brooke Passes Through Shanghai to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Dr. Brooke, a special representative of the US Treasury Department and chairman of the Department of Agricultural Economics at Jinling University, returned to his country in April of this spring to report to the government on China's financial situation.

A special notice was sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which stated, "Regarding the case of the flour industry requesting a ban on wheat exports, we have read and understood your notice (Min Zi No. 274). After investigating, due to the poor harvest of wheat and miscellaneous grains this year and the high prices, this Ministry and the Ministry of Industry have jointly decided to ban wheat exports until the new wheat harvest in June of next year. Buckwheat, sorghum, corn, millet, and other miscellaneous grains not listed in the tariff, as well as flours of miscellaneous grains not listed in the tariff, will be subject to export tax according to the export tariff regulations of the 20th year of the Republic of China.

<h3>Shanghai Banking Community Discusses Issues with Tianjin Branches</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Peiping Trains Terminate in Dezhou　Southbound Trains Overcrowded</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident, and especially after the situation in Peiping and Tianjin changed, the most significant phenomena occurring between the north and Shanghai are the obstruction of transportation and the disruption of financial remittances, with the situation being extremely chaotic. Yesterday, the Shanghai-Peiping train only went as far as Dezhou. The Shanghai banking community also discussed ways to address the situation of their branches in Peiping and Tianjin. The details are as follows: ㊀ According to the two railway bureaus, starting yesterday, Shanghai-Peiping trains only sell tickets to Dezhou. Southbound trains still depart from Cangzhou Station and are extremely crowded. ㊁ Due to the war in Peiping and Tianjin, in addition to the Shanghai-Peiping and Shanghai-Tianjin remittances being impassable, the Shanghai banking community believes that measures should be taken to address the situation of their branches. It is reported that the head offices of each bank held a meeting a few days ago to discuss the aftermath of each branch.</p>
<h3>Returning Students from Japan Talk About Tokyo's Frenzied State</h3>
<p>Japanese Youth Comfort Group</p>
<p>Since Japan launched a large-scale invasion of China, Chinese students and residents in Japan have been filled with indignation and have been vying to return to their country. Especially the students do not want to stay in Japan anymore, but they cannot return in large numbers due to the ship's capacity. When the Japanese postal ship Nagasaki Maru arrived in Shanghai at 4:25 p.m. the day before yesterday, another group of students returned home. According to the students who returned home the day before yesterday, Chinese students are subjected to white people's oppression constantly. I think our people have long been aware of it, so there is no need to elaborate. Recently, the atmosphere in Tokyo has become more serious than before. The general Japanese public seems to be crazy. Newspapers promote and exaggerate the truth, and there is no end to it. The conscription is getting busier and busier. Tokyo has long been in a state of war, and all prices have risen. The market is quite chaotic. Most Japanese young people are quite ambitious to invade China. The reason is that the country's education level is relatively uniform and the government is easy to command. At the same time, because the Japanese government's usual control is strict, the Japanese people are ignorant of the international situation and the truth about the Sino-Japanese disputes. Under the rule of obedience, no matter how wrong the government is, they are happy to follow it. This point is worth noting for us. Furthermore, according to the reporter's inquiries from relevant parties in Shanghai, the Japanese naval landing force barracks in Shanghai, although there are not many actions during the day, only four or five Japanese soldiers patrol Hongkou and in the vicinity of the barracks every day, which is no different from usual, but at night, all activities in the barracks begin, such as equipping military supplies, etc., which are all loaded and unloaded at night. It was recently heard that another batch of Japanese troops was shipped from Tokyo to Shanghai the night before last. In addition, a children's federation organized by the Japanese children's joint organization, with more than 40 teenagers, also came to Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru yesterday. The children are around 15 years old. It is said that they came to Shanghai to comfort the so-called "Imperial Army" in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Beiyang Automobile Company Willing to Repair Anti-Japanese Vehicles for Free</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Beiyang Automobile Trading Company sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese Support Association yesterday, stating, "Japan is relying on its power to invade our North China. Our Han people share the same hatred and are willing to work with all our strength. If there are military vehicles in the front line and ambulance transportation in the rear, and other vehicles, if they are bombed, damaged, or have damaged parts, etc., they will be towed to our company's repair department. In addition to matching other parts, all duties are free to facilitate national needs and fulfill our responsibilities. I hope you will check and reply."</p>
<h3>Foreign Trade Association Re-elects New Directors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Industrial Foreign Trade Association held its third member representative meeting at Zhengyi Society on the seventh floor of the Nanjing Road Continental Market at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday. More than 50 people, including Fang Jiange, Xu Guanqun, Chen Jiqing, Ren Tugang, Gao Shiheng, Hu Xiyuan, and Fang Yexian, attended. Chairman Zhang Huikang gave an opening speech and reported on the association's work status. Then, the expansion of the association's work and the increase in expenses were discussed. The 5th Board of Directors decided that the membership fee will be changed to 5 yuan per month for basic members and 2 yuan per month for ordinary members, collected every six months, starting in 1926. The resolution was passed. Next, 15 directors were re-elected. As a result of the ballot counting, Gao Shiheng and others were elected as directors, and Xu Yangnan and others were alternates. Afterwards, there was a dinner, and Shi Renwang and Wu Chengrong performed harmonica entertainment, and exquisite domestic goods gifts were distributed.</p>
<h3>Foreign Company Chinese Staff Vow Not to Buy or Sell Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>All members of the Shanghai Foreign Company Chinese Staff Friendship Association held a group oath ceremony at 6 a.m. at the Public Stadium on Fangxie Road outside Ximen. Chairman Yu Xinyan gave a speech and led all members to take the oath. Yu Yaoqiu, representative of the Non-Buying and Selling Smuggled Goods Movement, gave a speech, expressing his admiration for the Chinese staff members for unanimously vowing not to buy or sell smuggled goods, and said that in the face of the increasingly urgent national crisis, the people's efforts in economic salvation are just as important as the soldiers defending the country on the front line.</p>
<h3>American Citizen Willing to Bleed for the Country</h3>
<p>Moved After Reading the Newspaper　Expresses Sentiment in a Letter</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported yesterday that Mrs. Twinem, a recent Chinese citizen, sent a letter stating her willingness to bleed for China. According to reports, Mrs. Twinem was originally an American citizen and has been a Chinese citizen for only 14 months. She is currently a professor at Jinling University. Although her letter is only a few words, her loyalty and indignation are admirable. The original letter is translated below. I think the patriotic women in the country will be inspired by the news:</p>
<p>July 24 Your newspaper translated the editorial of Dagong Bao, titled "China Does Not Seek Foreign Aid," which contains the words "China knows that no citizen of any country is willing to bleed for China." I read it and couldn't help but be moved. I have been a Chinese citizen for a short time (14 months). I think your newspaper must allow me, as a foreigner, to say that I am today and often willing to bleed for China. I am a proponent of pacifism, so I cannot take up arms for the United States, nor can I take up arms in China, but I am an experienced driver and hold a Red Cross certificate, so I am always willing to be called by my country (China) to bleed. Furthermore, I dare to say that there must be many more people like me who regard dying for China as the highest honor.</p>
<h3>The City's Various Sectors Actively Promote Relief Work</h3>
<p>Christian Churches Remit One Thousand Yuan to Beiping; Red Cross Society Purchases Large Quantities of Medicine</p>
<p>As the situation in North China worsens daily, and as both Beiping and Tianjin fall one after the other, the violent Japanese exploit airplanes and artillery to bombard and massacre our compatriots, exhausting the capacity for cruel brutality. The city's Christian Association, Red Swastika Society, Red Cross Society, and other organizations have risen up to provide relief to innocent afflicted compatriots, to prevent them from becoming displaced. Details of each organization's activities are listed below:</p>
<p>Christian Church Remits Funds for Relief</p>
<p>The city's Christian Association, angered by the Japanese disregard for humanity, using airplanes and artillery to carry out extremely cruel means, bombing our buildings, reducing the cities of Beiping and Tianjin to ashes, causing countless innocent people to be slaughtered, their corpses piled up and unattended to, coupled with the arson, rape, and murder by Japanese soldiers, causing extreme terror among the civilians, who have nowhere to flee. Upon receiving reports, the Association was greatly indignant and, in addition to stepping up relief and fundraising efforts, specially donated one thousand yuan yesterday, requesting the city's Joint Charity Relief Association to remit it to Beiping, to be entrusted to Mr. Adderfu of the American Legation in Beiping for distribution.</p>
<p>Red Swastika Society Handles Burials</p>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society, recognizing that the war in North China has begun, causing countless people to suffer, refugees to be displaced, crying for food, and corpses strewn across the fields without burial, telegraphed its branches in Beiping and Tianjin yesterday, instructing them to promptly handle burials, as well as relief for refugees and treatment for wounded soldiers, in accordance with the Society's charitable principles, and to shelter war refugees to prevent them from wandering. The headquarters is now trying to raise funds to provide for large-scale shelter. The Society has formulated specific plans for relief and shelter work during this extraordinary period, so that branches in various locations can be dispatched at any time should the war expand.</p>
<p>Relief Efforts in Beiping and Tianjin Face Difficulties</p>
<p>According to news from the Chinese Red Cross: ⑴ According to visitors from Beiping, transporting wounded soldiers from the suburbs of Nanyuan to hospitals in the city is extremely difficult due to transportation problems, resulting in wounded soldiers scattered across the fields. Hospitals in Beiping are currently doing their best to treat the wounded and disabled. ⑵ In the Tianjin area, the Chinese Autonomous Region is unable to commence relief work due to intense Japanese bombing, and the situation is unclear. ⑶ Tianjin telegrams were still going through yesterday. The Red Cross Secretary-General Pang Jingzhou telegraphed doctors Geng Dichun, Zhu Shiying, Liang Baojian, Shen Hongxiang, and Li Zongyao in Tianjin, inquiring in detail about the relief work situation in the Tianjin Concessions. Once a reply is received, preparations will be made to supply large quantities of medicine. ⑷ The General Administration of Relief Affairs in Nanjing has been established, with Liu Ruiheng as the director, and Jin Baoshan and Pang Jingzhou as deputy directors. Mei Zhaolin is the head of the medical team, and Xu Shilun is the head of the general affairs team. The Red Cross relief committee has made concrete decisions on purchasing ambulances, X-ray machines, and large quantities of bandages and medicines. Furthermore, according to Red Cross officials, the rapid changes in the political situation in Beiping and Tianjin have meant that relief work in those areas can only be carried out by the Chinese Red Cross North China Relief Committee, which is organized by the medical community in Beiping and Tianjin. The Shanghai Red Cross is currently working hard to purchase bandages and large quantities of medicines, which will be transported to Baoding, Cangxian, and other places for use.</p>

<h3>The City Council Requests Serious Negotiations with the Japanese Side to Restrain Their Soldiers and Civilians</h3>
<p>Do Not Stage Any More Farces to Disturb the Citizens; Japanese Commander Issues Statement Expressing Regret</p>
<p>Since the 24th of last month, the Japanese Shanghai Naval Landing Force, under the pretext of a missing sailor, has been sending patrols across the border, checking pedestrians, and deploying armored vehicles and artillery, causing great anxiety among the citizens. Residents of Zhabei have been fleeing, and the Hongkou district is also in a state of panic. As a result, industry and commerce have withered. It has been learned that the Joint Association of Citizens of the First Special District and the sub-associations of the Hongkou District's 5th, 6th, 7th, 10th, 15th, 17th, 25th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 36th, 38th, 41st, and 47th districts have jointly submitted a petition to the Joint Association, requesting that it be forwarded to the city government, requesting serious negotiations with the Japanese Consul, so that the Japanese Naval Landing Force soldiers stationed in Shanghai and the Japanese residents staying in Shanghai must be strictly restrained, and must refrain from acting rashly, disturbing the citizens, so as to maintain the city's economy and calm the people. It has been learned that the lost Japanese sailor Miyazaki Sadao was rescued after jumping into the Jingjiang River and has been transferred from Beijing to Shanghai to return to his unit. The farce has come to an end.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, the Japanese Naval Landing Force Commander Okawauchi issued a statement saying: Since the case of the missing Japanese Naval Landing Force sailor first class Miyazaki Sadao occurred on the 24th of last month, the authorities of the force have clarified the circumstances after Miyazaki was transferred from Beijing to Shanghai on the 29th. The force, in the name of the adjutant, issued all the circumstances, which were generally the same as Miyazaki's record at our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the same time, Commander Okawauchi issued the following statement: From the night of July 24th, when the sailor Miyazaki went missing, until today, the Naval Landing Force expresses its full respect and gratitude for the enthusiasm and cooperation of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Consulate General Police, the resident officials and the Chinese officials in searching for him. During this important period, this incident caused social unrest, and we are extremely sorry. The Naval Landing Force will be deeply vigilant about this incident, and at the same time, it will strengthen itself to achieve its security mission.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Bishop Praying for China</h3>
<p>Venerable Fathers, Beloved Brothers, the situation in North China presents a state of war and has suddenly become tense. We cannot be indifferent to the significant impact of war. Not only do we, as Saint Paul said, "sympathize with those who suffer," but we also urge you to do your utmost to protect the invaded country. We are Catholic believers, so our patriotism should exceed that of any other citizen. Because our Catholicism is of God, we cannot be indifferent to the part of the world that God has given to each of us, which is our country. The country is the heritage of our ancestors, the mother who gave birth to us and nurtured us. We have an obligation to be loyal to the country. According to Saint Thomas, we have three duties in this world to repay, namely to God, to our parents, and to our country. Since we should have respect, regard, and love for God and our parents, we should naturally also have genuine respect for our country. However, how can this genuine respect be realized in this situation? We certainly cannot all go to the front lines to risk bullets, shed blood, and sacrifice our lives as soldiers on the front lines, but can't we organize support and do our best to help the soldiers defending the country? How can we help? Undoubtedly, we can provide large quantities of various necessities required by the soldiers protecting the country, especially by praying, praying to the only God who can help people. We pray that God protects the officials who bear the important responsibility of the country, and that God grants us a military chairman with the will to assess the situation and respond to the environment for the benefit of the country. During the Xi'an Incident, he was inspired by meditation on the suffering of Jesus, increased his willpower, was willing to sacrifice himself, and was unwilling to give up until the last moment of sacrifice. We pray for him, for all officials, for the military on the front lines, and for China, praying that China unites from top to bottom, that the military and civilians cooperate, that there is long-term peace and stability within, and that China's international status is enhanced, carrying out God's will, so that the Kingdom of Jesus will be embodied in China and receive the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. During this extremely dangerous period, the priest recites the prayer of the Sacred Heart of Jesus daily during Mass, according to the rites of the Holy Church, and the laity recite the prayer of the Sacred Heart of Jesus during Mass. This is a special directive. July 27, 1937 AD, Bishop Hui of the Shanghai Diocese.</p>
<h3>The Stock Exchange Will Open as Usual Today</h3>
<p>Implementing the Use of New Bookkeeping Methods</p>
<p>The city's Chinese Stock Exchange has approved the use of new bookkeeping methods by the board of directors in order to unify accounting.

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Loan Established; First Installment Paid</h3>

<h3>Appeal in the Tang Youren Assassination Case Underway</h3>
<p>The Second Appeal Was Rejected; Defense Lawyers Are Drafting the Indictment</p>
<p>Liu Zhennan from Hubei and Qiu Jiyu from Shaoxing, who were suspected of jointly assassinating Tang Youren, the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs from Hunan, on December 25, 1935, were arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Police and the French Concession Police successively between the autumn and winter of last year. Because the crime occurred in the French Concession, they were brought to the Special Second Court by the French Police Department. The French Police Department prosecuted them according to law. The initial trial resulted in the finding that Liu and Qiu were indeed guilty, and they were sentenced to death and deprived of their civil rights for life. The convicts refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Third Branch Court. After investigation by the investigation court and deliberation by the collegiate bench, it was determined that the two convicts' appeals were entirely empty words, and no substantial evidence was presented to refute the claims. There was no reason for the appeal, and the appeal was rejected on the morning of the 30th of last month. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It has been learned that Liu and Qiu expressed their continued dissatisfaction with the second instance judgment of the High Third Branch Court and prepared to file a third appeal with the Supreme Court in the hope of overturning the death sentence and declaring them innocent. After receiving the third instance judgment, they will file an application with the High Third Branch Court. It is said that a lawyer defending Liu and Qiu is drafting the grounds for appeal.</p>

After personnel are dispatched to report for inspection, the body will be collected and buried.</p>

<p>Every year, from February or March to late autumn and early winter, the number of unidentified floating corpses recovered from the Huangpu River in this city reaches 200 or 300. The peak period for discovery is generally in summer. Last month was the hottest period, which is also one of the months with the most floating corpses. An inquiry was made to the Nanshi Rescue Bureau. In that month, from the Longhua Cement Factory in the south to Gaogiao in the east, a total of 79 corpses were recovered. Male corpses accounted for 18, female corpses only 2, and children's corpses 19. Of these, 34 were identified and claimed by family members, and 45 were buried by the bureau for those without family members. As for the areas where floating corpses were found, the Lujiazui area of the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek were the most common, followed by the Yangshupu area. There were few discoveries of corpse recovery work on the Nanshi Huangpu Riverfront. In addition to the bureau's patrol boats, the Customs Water Police Department also assisted. Furthermore, due to the hot weather in recent days, many ignorant men often swim naked in the Huangpu River for fun, but those who are not familiar with swimming sometimes drown. Recently, the Water Police Department recovered two naked male corpses, aged about 20 or 30, from Lujiazui and Yangshupu. They have been handed over to the Rescue Bureau for collection, pending family identification.</p>

<h3>Huang Chu Jiu's Estate and Debts; Creditors' Meeting Scheduled</h3>
<p>Special Second Court Issues Announcement; Meeting Scheduled for August 18th</p>
<p>After Huang Chu Jiu, a prominent businessman, passed away in the winter of the 19th year of the Republic, his various enterprises, including the Gongfa Company and Riye Bank, were simultaneously declared bankrupt. A liquidation office was established, and accountants were commissioned to audit the accounts. Subsequently, due to numerous lawsuits filed by creditors with the former Public Concession Court, the court ordered the liquidation office to be dissolved and appointed accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu Zheng to liquidate and audit the accounts. After two distributions of 20% of the debt, the Public Concession Court was taken back, and the Special Second District Court was established to take over the case, dispatching personnel to execute the liquidation of Huang Chu Jiu's estate and debts, and gradually clearing up the debts owed to and by the deceased, as well as various mortgaged debts. A creditors' meeting was convened, but due to insufficient creditor attendance, the meeting failed to reach a resolution. The Special Second Court has now issued an announcement convening a second creditors' meeting. The announcement reads: "Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court Announcement Regarding the Liquidation of Huang Chu Jiu's Estate and Debts, Case No. 16, Executed in the 20th Year of the Republic. The first creditors' meeting was previously convened, but the attendance of creditors did not meet the statutory debt amount, resulting in an inconclusive meeting. It is now specifically scheduled for 2:00 PM on August 18th of this year in the First Tribunal of this court to hold the second creditors' meeting. All creditors are expected to attend on time without delay. Sincerely, this announcement. July of the 26th Year of the Republic, President Wang Simo."</p>

<p>Zhou Maoqing, a native of Tongzhou who claimed to be a pediatrician and resided at No. 71, Lane 25, Hailu Road, was visited by his cohabitant, Xia Youtian, from Yancheng, at noon on the 23rd of last month. Xia Youtian suffered from a stomach ailment that recurred intermittently. At that time, he suddenly felt his old ailment return and groaned in bed. Zhou Maoqing volunteered and gave him a packet of Western medicine powder, instructing him to take it three times. The pain would immediately stop. Xia took it as instructed, but the condition worsened and he became unable to speak. He was taken by car to Tongren Hospital, where doctors diagnosed that he had ingested poisonous drugs. The hospital telegraphed the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which dispatched Detective Dong Qingquan to arrest Zhou and take him to the police station. The next morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie fen presided over a continued hearing in the Third Criminal Court.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Respectfully, upon reading the report regarding the collision between our company's truck, Shanghai Municipal License No. 13797, and the Xielong truck, Shanghai Municipal License No. 13537, on Xipu Road at the fish market on July 31st, it does not conform to the facts. Upon investigation, the front headlight of our truck was damaged some time ago and has not yet been repaired. At the time, only the small headlight was on. Even assuming that the large headlight was on, the oncoming vehicle would have been blinded by the light, and the collision should have occurred at the front. Since the collision occurred at the rear, the responsibility for the accident is clear. Therefore, we briefly state the circumstances as above and request that you correct the report. Please trouble the editorial department of Shen Bao to make the correction. From Datong Automobile Company, August 1st.</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>Reading "Defend Lugou Bridge"</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>After the flames of war rose at Lugou Bridge, the response from the loyal and brave soldiers at the front lines was echoed by the unanimous and resolute roar of the entire nation: Fight to the end—echoing the front-line soldiers' "Lugou Bridge is our tomb" was "Defend Lugou Bridge"!</p>
<p>"Defend Lugou Bridge"! This heroic cry not only represents the nation's gratitude and admiration for the front-line soldiers, nor does it merely express "we pledge to be your support," but it also has a greater significance: the 450 million Chinese people are a single, pulsating organism, an iron group with a unified will!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the situation "changed" too quickly. When the front-line soldiers were prepared to repay the country with their blood, they were betrayed by traitors. The soldiers were not afraid to die, they did not begrudge dying, but they never imagined they would die at the hands of traitors. – After the fall of Beiping, Lugou Bridge fell soon after.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the three-act play "Defend Lugou Bridge," compiled by all members of the Chinese Playwrights Association after hearing about the Lugou Bridge Incident, was finished, printed, bound, and presented to readers, there was a sense of "too late."</p>
<p>But is it really too late? Although Lugou Bridge is currently occupied, the spirit of defending Lugou Bridge has not disappeared to this day. Not only has it not disappeared, but it is also expanding and growing. With such a righteous spirit, we firmly believe that Lugou Bridge will always be ours! We can even guarantee that Lugou Bridge will always be ours!</p>
<p>Second, the personal pain suffered by the people of Lugou Bridge and the soldiers is now descending upon the people and defending soldiers of various places in North China. The beans they planted are crushed by enemy tanks, the houses they lived in are destroyed by the enemy, and they are rewarded with the enemy's whips and fists. Isn't this enough to make us suffer? Can we forget Lugou Bridge!</p>
<p>Third, we "shout resistance is useless; we must swing our swords directly at the enemy"! We "cannot sit and wait to be beaten; we must use offense to eliminate offense!" (See the interlude "Charge Song" in the third act of "Defend Lugou Bridge.") The reckoning should start from the beginning. Before the Lugou Bridge Incident, we still had the four northeastern provinces. If we narrowly interpret "Defend Lugou Bridge," are we satisfied with just "Defend Lugou Bridge"?</p>
<p>We want to "Defend Lugou Bridge." We "shout resistance is useless; we must swing our swords directly at the enemy"!</p>
<p>"When we have pens, we use pens; when we have mouths, we use mouths; when we don't even have time to use our mouths and pens, we will have to fight the enemy on the battlefield with our blood and flesh. We are unwilling to be slaves, and we are willing to pledge with our blood the eternal survival of our nation!" (See the preface to "Defend Lugou Bridge.")</p>
<p>The flames of war at Lugou Bridge are the flames of reviving the Chinese nation, and the roar of "Defend Lugou Bridge" is the first sound of awakening of the Chinese nation!</p>
<p>Defend Lugou Bridge! Defend North China! Defend the Motherland!</p>
<h3>Safeguarding Chabei</h3>
<p>— Ya Lu</p>
<p>Amidst the urgent cries of enemy encroachment in North China, we receive two messages that deserve attention: According to a Shanxi telegram dated one day, "Bandits and puppets in Chabei are taking advantage of the situation to resume activities in recent days. Director Yan, to prevent any eventuality, has telegraphed the forward troops in Suiyuan to be strictly vigilant." Another telegram from Guihua states, "Tang Enbo arrived in Suiyuan from Jining on the 31st to discuss defense matters in the Sui border with Fu Zuoyi and Zhao Chengzhou." After seeing these two messages, we firmly believe that, like Director Yan's diligent governance and earnest hard work in resisting the enemy in Shanxi in recent years, as well as Tang and Fu's recapture of Suiyuan last year, due to their loyalty and bravery for the country, if the bandits and puppets of a certain party come to invade Sui again, they will surely be severely attacked and not be invaded.</p>
<p>We know that since Japan has greatly increased its troops in North China this time, it is by no means the case that it will be over after occupying Pingjin. It is very obvious that they will have even greater ambitions. In that case, the bandits and puppets of Chabei are taking advantage of the situation to resume activities, and in the near future, there will be a possibility of expansion. How can we ignore it?</p>
<p>The enemy has been able to repeatedly invade and occupy our territory because we did not have sufficient preparations. If we have thorough preparations and courageous resistance against the enemy, we can at least preserve the places that the enemy wants to seize from us. This fact was very evident in the Suiyuan War last year.</p>
<p>We recall that a certain party's plan to occupy Suiyuan was not realized in last year's Suiyuan War, and at the same time, we see that a certain party has now instigated bandits and puppets to disturb Sui and Chahar again. We anticipate that a certain party has long had a plan for the invasion of Chahar and Suiyuan and is determined to do so. Therefore, we should have active strategies to defend ourselves against aggression and safeguard Chahar and Suiyuan. However, in today's situation where the enemy's flames are raging, preserving Chahar and Suiyuan is by no means something that the local authorities and the people of Chahar and Suiyuan can do alone. At the same time, we also need the central government and the national strength and enthusiasm of the people to give considerable support in order to succeed.</p>
<p>The facts tell us that after the fall of Pingjin, the enemy has been able to take advantage of many conveniences in transportation and can drive straight into several provinces in North China. In order to preserve the provinces of North China that have not yet been lost, we must resolutely and calmly resist the enemy. However, Chahar and Suiyuan are the shields of our northwest, and their diplomatic and political significance is sufficient to affect our northwest provinces. Therefore, if we want to preserve the integrity of the northwest provinces, we should do our best to safeguard the security of the territorial sovereignty of Chahar and Suiyuan.</p>
<p>At this point, we can no longer lose our land, because losing one point of land will strengthen the enemy's power and weaken our strength. This is what all of us in the country should recognize.</p>
<h3>Fishing Boat</h3>
<p>— Chun Ye</p>
<p>The April wind brings the heat of early summer, blowing across the sea. Groups of fishing boats appear on the coast of the southern country. It's the season for yellow croaker again.</p>
<p>The fishing village, named for its fish production, presents an active scene again. Fish merchants come to the village in groups to set up fish markets. Peddlers selling daily necessities also come to the village once a year to promote their goods. Village women are busy repairing old nets, village men are tidying up their fishing boats, and children are looking forward to a good meal of fresh fish. In short, the entire fishing village is filled with a lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>The old people, based on their experience, report that it is the weather for sailing. So, the rows of fishing boats parked on the beach in front of the village, like warships that have received orders, set sail in groups for the vast ocean. When the boats leave the beach, the village women watch the men or sons on the boats in groups, tears streaming from the corners of their eyes, because experience tells them that the fishing boats that set sail are often lost. However, these young fishermen do not feel that way. Their entire mood is occupied by the ambition of hope for a full load.</p>
<p>The boat floats on the sea, and the fishermen's songs fly in the air. Some tell jokes, some sit at the stern and gamble, and some sing folk songs. They are waiting, waiting for the night to come.</p>
<p>The sun sets so slowly in the ocean. Perhaps the oil lamps have already been lit in the fishing village, but the dark blue sea is still reflecting the dazzling golden light. The fishermen look at the setting sun. Ten thousand golden rays are shining on the sea. They sing:</p>
<p>The red sun sets in the sea,</p>
<p>Open the net and wait for the fish to come;</p>
<p>The lonely sound of "duk duk" rings all night,</p>
<p>Until dawn, the boat is full of wealth. (Note 1)</p>
<p>The sun finally sinks below the horizon, and a black curtain covers the ocean. At this time, groups of fishing boats find their fishing nets, take out the "Da Gu" wooden planks, and start knocking the lonely sound of "duk duk duk." The ocean is calm, only the sea breeze is blowing gently. The fishing lights covering the sea are just like the bright stars in the sky. There is no laughter, no figures, only the sound of "duk duk" occupies the entire space.</p>
<p>The summer night is short. In a moment, the eastern sky has revealed a slightly white dawn. Experience tells them. The fishermen open their huge nets and spread them around the boat. The empty nets go down, and the heavy nets come up. They sing:</p>
<p>The empty nets come and go lightly,</p>
<p>They turn into a thousand pounds in the water;</p>
<p>Hands go into the cabin to touch and go,</p>
<p>All are my good darlings. (Note 2)</p>
<p>The sun shines on the beach in front of the village, and the yellow sand is as dazzling as gold. At this time, the sound of people is like thunder on the shore. The fishing boats that went out yesterday are returning in groups again. Village women are heading towards the warmth, children are touching the fresh goods in the cabin, fish merchants are evaluating and bargaining for prices. The sound waves of excitement flow everywhere on the beach again, but everyone is saying: "This year, it is not as much as last year. We can only see what tomorrow will be like." A depressed color is painted on the faces of everyone on the beach. And the literate people are reading the newspaper saying: "×× fishing boats appeared in our South China territorial waters again during the fish season."</p>
<p>(Note 1) It is a small song of the fishermen in South China. The "Gu Sheng" is knocked with a wooden plank. Its function is to make the fish gather near the boat by hearing the sound. Eventually, they are caught because they are stunned by the sound. This is a fishing method that has been used for hundreds of years, and only yellow croaker can be caught. Commonly catching yellow croaker is called "Da Gu."</p>
<p>(Note 2) "Good darlings" refers to fish.</p>
<h3>We will fight to the death on the battlefield!</h3>
<p>— Lu Ying woodcut</p>
<p>Reader's Voice</p>
<h3>Please Use the Ritual Fees for Proper Purposes</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianci</p>
<p>In Shanghai, in the seventh month of the lunar calendar, many merchants or residents of alleys, very superstitious, follow the custom of pooling money to invite monks and Taoists to perform a "Taiping Gong Jiao" (lit. Peace Public Ritual), believing that this can transcend the souls of the dead and prevent the entanglement of wandering ghosts, so that they can be safe and sound throughout the year. In fact, this kind of thing is not worth a knowing smile.</p>
<p>Just think, what do you see after spending a lot of money? It's just that everyone has a lively day, making the monks, Taoists, foil shops, and paper shops earn some money.</p>
<p>Therefore, I suggest that the readers of this newspaper, anyone who wants to hold a "Taiping Gong Jiao," please save this ritual fee. Even if someone wants to initiate a ritual, please readers do their best to stop them, making them stop holding it, and transfer the money saved to proper uses.</p>
<p>Because it costs at least dozens of yuan to do a "Taiping Gong Jiao," if we save it, then just in Shanghai alone, it is not difficult to have tens of thousands of gold. If all parts of the country can save it, gathering sand into a tower, wouldn't it be a very considerable sum?</p>
<p>So, we can use this money saved for good deeds, donating it to the disaster relief association to relieve the victims in various parts of Sichuan, so that these compatriots who are waiting to die can get this sweet dew and survive, so as to cultivate our country's vitality. Please think, taking money to do such things is more valuable and meaningful than using it for useless rituals.</p>
<p>Also, like the Lugou Bridge Incident this time, a strong neighbor is pressing down on us, making unreasonable demands and all kinds of harsh conditions. All of our people, unable to bear it, rose up to resist in order to seek the survival of our country, but there are few soldiers and lack of food, especially relief supplies are even more needed.</p>
<p>This newspaper reported on the 29th that Li Guang'an, director of the 29th Army's Shanghai Office, reported on the military situation at the front, saying: "What all sectors of the country should pay attention to is that when the great battle begins at the front, a lot of relief supplies are needed. These supplies are easier to prepare and purchase in Shanghai. I hope that all sectors of Shanghai can quickly raise money to prepare and purchase them and send them to the front for use. As for the fundraising for our army by various parties in the past, Chairman Song expressed that because it was a local war of resistance, he did not dare to accept the money of consolation from various parties. However, the current situation is different, and the situation has already expanded. If we are to carry out relief work and set up wounded soldier hospitals, etc., money is needed everywhere. I still hope that all sectors will provide assistance."</p>
<p>After reading the above report, we know that the soldiers who are fighting bloody battles at the front desperately need financial assistance. We might as well use this money to donate as much as possible to the soldiers at the front or prepare medical supplies, so that the soldiers can be encouraged and defend the country even better. Readers, isn't this putting useful money in the most proper place?</p>
<h3>Facial Makeup</h3>
<p>— Beast</p>
<p>The world is a big theater, the theater is a small world. Buildings come and go, is it man or illusion? Thus there is a compilation of "Facial Makeup". Readers, please open your eyes and watch the officials take the stage. This is the preface.</p>
<p>According to Tianjin News, it is reported that the local authorities "Mayor Zhang Zizhong" declared today that the time for peace has not yet reached the point of despair. Our army on the Lugou Bridge side has been restored to the state it was eight days ago, while the Japanese side has not yet completely withdrawn. I have always put the country first. (Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th)</p>
<p>According to official claims, Zhang Zizhong made a statement in Tianjin, roughly saying that the 29th Army has returned to the state it was eight days ago, but the Japanese army has not completely withdrawn. Zhang also said that Zhang will never do anything to let down the people. (Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th)</p>
<p>It is heard that before Song Zheyuan left Ping, he hand-wrote instructions to Zhang Zizhong and others, dividing up the duties of various agencies. The newly appointed director of the Ping Police Bureau, Pan Yugui, arrived at the bureau on the morning of the 29th to take up his duties. Ping Mayor Zhang Zizhong will take office at 3:00 PM. As for the duties and date of taking the Jicha Political Council position, it has not been determined. (Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th)</p>
