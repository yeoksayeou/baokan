<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本衆議院的解散</h3>
<p>— 禹</p>
<p>日本衆議院在第七十屆議會閉幕的一天。突遭斷然的解散了。貴族院依照憲法所規定。也於卽日起停會。就表面看來。這眞是“靑天霹靂。”因為在七十屆議會。不但政黨方面處處讓步。就連軍部的態度。似乎也稍稍溫和起來。政黨跟軍部的衝突。至少比議會不曾續開以前弛緩了一些龐。大預算等重要議案旣在議會順利地通過。前幾天且又盛傳政民兩黨人員將無條件加入內閣。担黨鐵道拓務兩省專任大臣。許多人認為政黨跟軍部協調告成。議會將無事閉幕。並不是毫無根據的。</p>
<p>可是日本政局在表面固然“平靜無事。”內骨子的磨擦實在始終沒有停止。議會主義跟法西斯主義的對立。斷非輕易可以消除的。當然我們也承認若干政黨人員只要能夠留些活動的餘地。就願意暫時屈辱着。但是這僅有的活動餘地。軍部也不會慷慨給與的。軍部最終的意念是要舊有政黨意識完全消滅。而以御用的新政黨取而代之。舊政黨必須絕對聽從軍部的指揮。纔有存在的可能。政黨方面滿以為預算案等旣給通過。當能換得軍部若干實質的讓步。那裏知道你退一步。他却反進兩步。政黨被迫而作最後的抗爭。要政府認可修正選舉法案。而延緩其他議案的審議。這是不得不然的。可是軍部就以此為口實。把議會摧毀了。</p>
<p>這次衆議院的解散還有一個重要的因素。就是新政黨的成熟。久巳醖釀着的法西斯官僚御用的新黨。據說最近有着新的開展。軍部以至仰承軍部鼻息的政府。現覺新黨已有充分的把握。由新黨在議會解散後重選舉中跟旣成政府相競爭。這便是合法法西斯派所謂“合法的手段。”</p>
<p>雖然如此。旣成政黨是不會就這樣完全死滅的。政友會安籐幹事長說。“吾黨出席總選舉時將與之作殊死戰。”民政黨聲明書裏也說。“將以國民大衆為後盾。期望必定的勝利。”同時政民兩黨的提携機運非常濃厚。甚至有合併的可能。這種力量雖未見得怎樣充實。但對淸一色法西斯政權。似乎還具有巨大的阻力。林首相說要訴之於“國民的正當良心。”日本大多數國民是否同情於法西斯。這看最近左翼團體潛勢力的增厚。便可測騐明白。所以在我們看來。新政黨能否獲得壓倒的勝利。倒很成問題。縱使新政黨運用特殊手段把選舉票硬生生地拉過去。但那種強制造就的局面。能不能持久也還是疑問呢。</p>
<h3>日政府與政黨準備求直於民意</h3>
<p>林首相披露競選政綱　民政黨攻擊政府謬舉</p>
<p>［東京］政府决定於四月三十日實行總選舉、已得裁可、今日以官報公布如次詔書、朕依帝國憲法第四十五條及衆議院議員選舉法第十八條、命於昭和十二年四月三十日實行眾議院議員之總選舉、（一日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］民政黨於三十一日晚發表聲明書、謂本黨在林內閣內無閣員或政務官等連絡員、而當審議法案時、殊感不便、然刻苦精勵、使預算案·稅制案·及其他在發展國力安定人民生活上必要之諸法案、通過議會、其已經審畢者約達五十件、然至三十一日晨、在議會正欲審議關稅案之時、政府突以阻害議事為理由、解散議會、實不可解、今次議會中最重要之社會法·國民健康保險法·又與國防有密接關係之燃料法·在貴族院卽將成立之時、解散衆議院、以致該法不能成立、殊屬矛盾、本黨敢問天下輿論、就為國家國民之忠誠者、本黨將於總選舉之時、主張革新國政之政策、而以肅正選舉、披瀝誠意、並以國民大衆為後盾、期望必勝、（一日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］昨晚林首相發表談話、其中四點、殊堪注意、㊀重復申明政黨對現有時局之觀念、與政府不同、卽政府認時勢極端嚴重、而政黨在議會討論時則不如此感覺、㊁政府將提出三項重大政策、訴諸人民之公正評判、卽充實國防、發展國家力量、與國體明徵、㊂內閣各大臣準備於必要時、舉行選舉演講運動、政府雖無組織新黨之意、但希望對時局有澈底認識之新黨得以產生、並與之合作、惟此僅為人與人間之提携問題、而並無所謂政府之與黨存在、㊃苟新議會之情勢反映總選舉之結果、能證明政府之認識錯誤者、則政府自當反省、而立卽辭職、但如政府之認識、證明仍屬正當、或新局勢易於感應、則將考慮應否重予解散、林首相上述談話、或可作為推斷將來政局發展之綫索、據一般觀察、組織新黨雖感極端困難、但將採取何種方式、則不易逆料、此間各報對議會解散、均一致表示反對之意、而東京日日新聞尤毫不顧忌、與其他方均有同感、指政府之行動、為“懲罰的解散”云、（中央社一日電）</p>
<p>［東京］政府今日在閣議席上、協議林首相本月五日在首相官邸召集地方長官會議時之訓詞、結果决定左列三大要點、㊀闡明此次解散議會之理由、將政府之眞意所在、努力使國民徹底了解、㊁總選舉之際、竭力以圖肅正、同時鑑於本屆議會責備蹂躪人權之聲浪甚深、故認為當局者亦有反省之必要、㊂政府對於此次選舉之態度、在使立憲政治得到健全之發達、促進政黨之自覺、須標榜此項主旨、而以毀私殉公之精神、實事求是、不得偏於一黨一派云云、（一日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］議會解散後、兩大政黨、卽民政黨及政友會、佔優越地位之選區、對於政府之舉動、已有嚴酷之批評、其餘諸選區、有對新選舉表示漠不關心者、亦有對新選舉表示深切之興趣者、並據議會被解散前之組織、該議會共四百六十六席、內分民政黨二百零四席、政友會一百七十一席、昭和會二十四席、社會大衆黨二十席、國民同盟十一席、無產黨二席、東方會九席、其他六席、獨立派十七席、空席二、現因新黨運動發生、且因社會大衆黨復現蓬勃之勢、故此後普選中、頗有畸形議員產生之可能、如前陸相宇垣大將、此次亦有被選議員之說、蓋宇垣之本鄕、已在督促使加入選舉運動云、至報紙方面、朝日新聞謂議會之解散、固明知其不可免、但人民生估之不能安定、政府亦應負其責、日日新聞則稱，國民對於解散議會之重要性、恐難了解、而首相亟廳組織新黨以資倚靠云、國民新聞則謂、林內閣大約已預期新政黨之成立、庶政治分野得重新分配、而使政治空氣有澄清之望云、讀賣新聞則對於政府及政黨、均表示不滿、並對於前途選舉之是否淸潔、表示懷疑、尤因政府對於新政黨之成立、極為關切之故云、（中央社一日路透電）</p>
<p>［東京］本月三十日為第二十次選舉衆議院議員之期、茲查有選舉權者之人數、根據去年十二月廿日確定之名簿、內務省地方局則以全國地方廳之報告為基礎、已於一日午後發表、其總數計有權者共一千四百六十一萬八千二百九十八人、前屆總選之際、有選舉權者為一千四百四十七萬九干五百五十三人、兩相比較之下、此次則增加十三萬八千餘人、一般認為係因人口自然增加之關係云、（一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>政友會與民政黨擬組聯合陣綫</h3>
<p>兩黨不免合併乎　內閣擬乘機充實</p>
<p>［東京］政友民政兩黨互相呼應、表明反政府熊度、攻擊政府解散議會之不當、三十一日議會解散後、政友會安藤幹事長對民政黨永井幹事長提議、政府今次解散議會、違反立憲精神、政民兩黨應為協力、在總選舉戰對抗政府、以期必勝、永井對此雖未卽答、然在言外巳表示協力意見、但因今次解散、突然實行、政民兩黨對於選舉未有對策、關於選舉經費標語等、亦未有把握、故其提携程度如何、未能推察、然政府旣有組織新黨計劃、而政民兩黨聯合戰綫、對付政府、其結果將必誘致兩黨合併之他步、（一日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］林內閣因將考慮總選舉對策、現决定以組閣時發表之致綱為基礎、製作各政策之具體案、將於日內發表、以期國民理解現內閣、以便總選舉時獲得多數政府黨議員、現內閣此舉與組織新黨運動有關、頗為各方面注目、（一日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］政府三十一日解散議會、同時决意以現內閣獨自立場、研究實施政策之具體案、以對付總選舉後之政局、至於補充閣員问題、林首相從早考慮人選、現因情形逼迫、擬於實行總選舉以前、任命文部鐵道拓務三相、（一日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］伍堂商相提出議會之製鐵事業法案及關於銑鐵鋼料之法案、因議會解散、未能成立、因此商相被迫早將樹立對策、以應付一般物價問題、商相為此目的、擬發動製鐵事業法第二十二條第二項之緊急勒令、據本條文規定、政府於必要時、得檢查製鐵業所．工廠．倉庫·帳簿·書類等、卽本法為確立强力鐵鋼政策之最重要條文、可以之抑壓鐵價暴漲、因此商相熊度、對於鐵界有重大影響共前途極堪注目、（一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>貴族院推測新黨趨勢</h3>
<p>認為當可實現</p>
<p>［東京］貴族院研究會之伯爵團、一日正午集合於華族會館、對於時局問題交換意見、尤以關於總選後之旣成政黨及新黨問題之推測、大致如左、徵諸此次解散衆議院之理由等等情形觀之、則社會大衆黨及其他無產黨、自當獲得相當勢力、至關於新黨問題、雖尚未見有積極動向、而政府確希望新黨之出現、首相對於此項問題、曾在拜領大命之事前、早與二三有力人士會見、似屬事實、故此案終必實現也、而其大部分仍由旣成政黨中具有時局新認識者、為其中心勢力、再參以新選之議員人數、當在一百名至一百五十名之譜、但將以何人為其黨魁、當屬問題、旣成政黨之人員、固有未便之處、自不待論、由理想上言之、當以近衛天磨公爵為最適任、但該公爵多半不至出馬云、（一日同盟電）</p>

<h3>日本議員窘境</h3>
<p>［東京］因政府解散議會、由白堊殿堂内議員地位、轉落為普通市民之各政黨代議士、三十一日紛繚電致選舉地域、報告解散、並請求援助、然因總選舉之日、僅在一月之後、且在此物價高漲時際、選舉經費不易籌達、其可依靠之文書戰、亦因紙價漲三成、提高郵費法自今日實施、至於其他酒類亦一律漲價、諸員莫不感苦痛、從來以無産號召之社會大衆黨、迭次遭遇選舉戰、無法對付、决定今次抛棄文書戰、以計節省經費、東京市内各印刷所、預料總選舉之文書戰、大登廣告、開始競争、展開選舉氣分、（一日同盟電）</p>

<h3>南遊鱗爪（二）</h3>
<p>— 君實</p>
<p>文化低落的民族，只配過着惡劣的生活，做被壓榨者，被支配者；而所謂文明的民族，天之驕子，當然是享受者，支配人者，壓榨人者．這恐怕是天下的通義，不用懷疑的！我們踏足到南島後，所見的馬來人能夠做鐵路，郵局或政府機關的中下級辦事員，已是榮幸萬分了，數目也不多．這是統治者以夷制夷的方法，𦆵能得到這種榮寵，此外則完全是農夫，礦工，苦力，和一般卑徵的職業。趕馬車,開汽車，男女待役，都是他們的專業。</p>
<p>馬來大生活的享受，是極其廉樸的，在終年高溫的氣候下衣住都可以不講究·男女衣着，下部都穿着一種長大的裙，叫做“沙籠”，下垂及踝，惟花樣不同。上穿短衣，長不及膝，布質或綢質不等，有紅綠花紋（男衣亦然）棕黑色的面龐與鮮艷的衣色，相映成趣。男女多數都赤着脚，高貴的穿拖鞋似的屐，男子頭上終年都戴着帽，信回敎者戴圓筒式的帽。爪哇人的帽用花布做成，各地均有一定的形式。如有職務者像鐵路，郵政職員穿制服時，戴上花布帽後，上面還要戴上一頂制帽。馬來亞的女子，鬟垂於腦後，與吾國舊時同，頭上另披上一個沙籠，或圍巾，或披肩，僅僅露出頭面。據說從前女子出外，姿容美麗的，有被刦奪危險，所以要蒙頭蓋面云。荷屬之峇厘島，女子槪裸露上體，不穿短衣。他如蘇島之峇達等處婦女，以及沙蓋女子，大都如此。</p>
<p>女子裝飾品，倒很講究、　　　　飾，胸針，頸鍊，耳環及手鐲脚環等，都要佩帶。</p>
<p>馬來人的房屋多離城市數里的僻壤的海邊，自成部落。形式與日本房屋相似，用木作柱，屋頂用亞峇（棕樹的一種）樹葉遮蓋：地板距地高四尺；前面陽台，爲接待賓客用；中間爲寢室，後面走廊爲廚房，用短梯升降，地板下可飼養牲畜。</p>
<p>食的方面，要算是他們全部生活裏最主要的一事了，食料最喜辛辣。他們吃飯，不像我們要用碗筷，或西洋式的刀叉，盛飯在香焦葉上，或盤內，手指代箸，但限於右手，（因大便時用左手指洗肛門）用手將菜飯拌勻，送入口裏。</p>
<h3>巴布亞土人</h3>
<p>喫老葉是他們一種特殊嗜好品，（此種嗜好，在南洋各處很普遍，不專屬馬來人，）無論男女，在閒暇無事，或飯後拿來咀嚼，彷彿像一般吸食紙烟有同樣的作用。此種老葉，係一種草本植物之葉，大如手掌，作心臟形，食時雜以檳榔，甘蜜，白灰等置口中咀嚼，味澀而辣，吃後滿口紅痕，齒牙亦紅黑，狀極可怖，老葉不獨供自己咀嚼，並用以餉客，客來時，用木盒盛着老葉，供客取用。年老後有齒牙的，還做有一個竹具，先將老葉放在筒內春碎後，然後下口，不過現代摩登女子，因爲愛護齒牙不再咀嚼老葉了。</p>
<p>信奉回教的，依據回敎的習俗，每年有一個月的禁食節，這一個月中，無論老少，每日從日出起，禁止食物，甚至飲水和咀嚼檳榔老葉都不許可，至日落才許飲食，嚴守不渝．禁食節究畢，乃設盛筵，合家團食，彷彿我們團年。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>“到監獄吃飯去”</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>報載有一失業者，因受生活的驅迫，在某家偷一木檯，然後向捕房自首，一經詰問，據供因失業已久，經濟無法維持，故出此舉，期入獄之後，衣食住得以暫告解决，結果判處拘役五十日示儆云。藉犯罪來求吃飯，可說是異想天開的。然而其計之苦，却也很足引人的惋歎。</p>
<p>失業之苦，是難以形容的。爲生活所壓迫，弱者在飢餓綫下哀呌，強者就鋌而走險。社會上作奸犯科者之多，大半皆是衣食住迫出來的。他們豈生而爲惡人，共敢於爲非，實不得已哩，誰不想安分做個良民？尤其是近年來，經濟恐慌，普遍各地，致失業之羣，徬徨街頭。外國時有飢餓隊的組織，向當局要求麵包，這也足見情形嚴重的一斑。</p>
<p>故這個失業者的行爲，是不算希奇的。他失業已久，除非不要活，否則便得想法子維持生計。然而工作在那里呢？這便使他不能不幹起偷的勾當，籍此入獄，以解决一時的衣食住。監獄生活雖苦，但比在外面飢凍，好過得多了。這辦法自然也非久計，可是至少在眼前，總不至於就白白餓死！若有人問起出獄之後，經濟又特如何維持？我只能說你太遠慮。</p>
<p>然而話雖這樣說，究竟願意入獄受苦的，怕不會多。要是以後一班失業者，個個像他一樣，一陷入末路，便齊喊一聲：“到監獄吃飯去！”我看那時就眞不好應付了。</p>
<h3>惆悵之什失去了的黃昏</h3>
<p>— 葉家怡</p>
<p>送走了悽凉的夕陽沈落在爲烟灰濁漫着的西方，黑暗就漸漸地爬上我的心頭：光明的掩沒襯出孤寂的哀悲來！</p>
<p>開亮了幽暗的燈光，爲的是想减去我底苦悶；可是這糢糊的光綫射在被時間剝蝕了泥質的墻壁上，狹小的房子裏更現得陰氣了！</p>
<p>“做了什麼？生命又在此消沈了一天！”</p>
<p>在抑鬱的黃昏下，只有一個抑鬱的影子伴着我。難堪的襲擊，使我抓住了，—緊緊地抓住我的亂髮，牠宛似我的仇人，滿腔的忿怒就好比在牠的上面</p>
<p>“去吧，這都市予你的有什麼？——霓紅的燈光，淫佚的歌曲，肉的苦笑，生命的角逐：”</p>
<p>但是，一年，二年……留下來了！</p>
<p>黃昏許也有美麗的吧，但只有巳往的一個：</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>那該不會忘掉的。是一個星星熌熌，流螢穿舞着，虫聲節凑在爽風習習底黃昏；沒有人的聲息的黃昏；恬靜，神秘，幽美的黃昏：那黃昏裏有兩個靑春的影子在星星下懷抱着，兩個熱烈的靈魂縈盤在和諧的氣息裏。還有少女歌着“夢戀”的一曲。那聲音像淸冽的泉聲，像天上的裳舞，牠繚繞在狹小而又廣漢的空間，飛入睡着人們的心海，掀開夢裏的微笑。</p>
<p>“不會忘記這一個黃昏麼？”我說。</p>
<p>“永遠地……”</p>
<p>啊！這太可紀念的黃昏如今是破碎了，失落在永不復得的大海裏。</p>
<p>遼遠沈醉的黃昏，如今在記憶逼近來，可是牠像一根蛇來吮着我的心血！</p>
<p>現在抑鬰的黃昏更暗淡，糢糊，緊束；把我這顆心壓成一粒煤渣，牠又爲記憶的蹴踏裂成無數的小點，留下來只是一個空虛的心房與難堪的黃昏了！</p>
<p>啊！我是多麼在記念着你啊！這失去了的黃昏。</p>
<h3>隂沈的春天</h3>
<p>這不是三月天麼？然而宇宙沒睜開牠的明眸呢！</p>
<p>每天，漸漸的冷雨在瓦背匯成細流從水管涎下，墮在積水的陰溝只是響着響着，老是這麼像時鐘的擺垂那樣單調的。舉頭看一看這灰淡而哀怨的雲天，聽這樣冷落的雨聲，這沈寂與悵惘是深重的！</p>
<p>——今年這春天……人們這麼常常嚷着。</p>
<p>這未盡的語意是十分的悵怨的。</p>
<p>死寂的池塘，不曾有朵點綴季節的綠萍，枯死的草坪又何曾有一朵野生的黃花沒有帶來春訊的燕子在低矮的天空穿射，也沒有蝴蝶戀着黃花夢。孩子爲了他新糊的紙鳶每天翹首望着迷糊的白天，只想一⾓的缺縫漏下一點太陽，讓太陽照醒這該醒的春光。終於，終於他小小的心靈也失望而陰沈了！</p>
<p>在惆悵中我掘起了我的遠去了的一個春天：</p>
<p>那是在我偏僻鄕村的郊野，也是這個三月天，但却有那鄕間三月天的情調：葱葱的麥隴，野花，明眸的太陽，煦煦而醉人的春風，還有牧童們坐在牛背上送過來的情歌。春天，眞是一個春天。</p>
<p>我的姑娘有一雙似春水的眼波和飛漲着桃色的臉龐，我們倆在青草的田塍共曳着一個蝴蝶形的風爭。那是我們的骨肉和靈魂共糊在一道的。</p>
<p>“玲子，這才是個春天呢是你的，也是我的；是我們兩人的。”</p>
<p>她倒在我的懷裏，在地上㧞起一朵黃花插在我的衣紐。她說：</p>
<p>“把住吧，抱住吧，抱住這春光；我們不要讓牠逃跑了。”</p>
<p>她笑得比春山還明麗，比太陽還溫柔。</p>
<p>“把我們的兩個心䌘在這風箏的綫上，吹到天上去吧像我們脫離了這人間一切的羈絆。”</p>
<p>那時靑春的靈魂勇敢而快樂的交流着。</p>
<p>然而，然而這春光是多麼的短促啊：兩個䌘在紙鳶綫上的心，不料被狂風吹斷了綫而離散了，如今，她的已深鎖在重重的閏裏！</p>
<p>每年，當自然的三月天重映到我失了神的眼晴，流落者的悲凉和創痛的心，翹望着故鄕的天邊，該是怎的難耐啊！</p>
<p>這陰沈的春天許是不久會來的吧，……</p>
<h3>平湖畫舫</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>衣上車塵尚未拭凈，卽匆匆僱得遊艇，回首南屏，待要聽取晚鐘，畫舫已輕輕剪水而北了。這時晚陽忽然撒起嬌來，不知躲到什麼地方去，灰晦色的天幕下，環湖諸山都隱隠扶上一層紫暗的量影；西望蘇堤，只能於水煙縹渺處尋得一線綠意，雖未飄雨，已使人覺得這時的西湖顰態可愛；也第一次認得西湖水的溫柔閒適而有光澤，在那樣平靜細膩的波面之上，倒映着山光柳色，紅亭橋岸，都如此迷離有致；卽輕盈若無的畫舫，也好像消受不起，眞令人不忍把划子打下，呌這嬌柔溫靜的水面剪破。</p>
<p>畫舫穿過斷橋，已進入裏湖來了，與迎面來的一隻畫舫擦蓬而過。使人驚奇的是那隻畫舫載着的却是三四個明眸善笑的女尼。船戶告訴我們，今天是舊暦四月八日，她們是來湖上放生唸經的。當前去的畫舫遊過斷橋，果然隔橋度水傳來隱隱的唸經聲和木魚聲。</p>
<p>在放鶴亭前，把畫舫䌘在一株柳樹下，那裏看到了馮小靑的墓，一個饅頭形式的土堆，埋葬着她一生的哀艷。從放鶴亭上去，走入一個石柱竪的墓門，在梅的綠葉下，訪過林和靖的墓和鶴塚，覺得隱士有此歸結，確也値得的了。而今鶴雖不再歸來，但年年梅花還是一樣繁放，更多了個聽明不俗的小靑作伴，和靖有知，自當微笑。像浮世俗者如我們一般遊客的憑吊歆羨，只不過是自作高蹈或聰明的俗物罷了。</p>
<p>因爲六點鐘尚有友人待約，只短短兩個鐘頭的湖遊實太珍貴了，在山上稍稍走了一趟，也不及舒舒徐徐的來消受林木的幽趣，又匆匆解舟而西，裏湖風景另有趣處，湖雖狹窄，自有高山深林。樓⾓別墅，都密集於此，我更愛此處的幽靜，不比新市場一帶的暄闐嘈雜。卽順便把畫舫划到惠中旅館門前，進去看了房子，約定明晨再搬過來，同伴似嫌不熱鬧，我可顧不了許多。過西泠橋時，沒有上去一訪小小的墓，心裏甚覺疚歉，她固然是一個妓女，但只要她心地明凈，純潔，縱然作妓女也無損於她的人格，比之一般欺世盜名者實高超萬倍。畫舫便由此折東，向平湖秋月遊去，平湖秋月係十景之一，亭樓無甚可觀，又非月夜，全看不出它的好處。對望卽南屏諸山，若能於淸晨幽夜，一杯綠茗，臨湖靜坐，廳鐘聲度水而來，當必有一種空靈的靜趣。但船戶說，那口大鐘今已移到裏湖的鳳林寺了。</p>
<p>畫舫本來停在羅苑右邊，先時不知這數椽白屋的羅苑已作了藝術學院，從平湖秋月出來，回頭看見那口洞開的鐵橺，裏面朱簷紅柱，甚是美奐，就胡亂闖進去，害得飾頭的門警忙追進來問係訪問何人。</p>
<p>畫訪離開羅苑再剪向湖心，湖上巳有幾分暮色了，始驚覺兩個鐘點的時間比起剛才在火車上竟會消磨得如此之快。遊舟也漸漸少下去。忽然又隱隱傳來一陣唸經聲和木魚聲，隨着微微的細波，飄散湖上。待回頭追尋，只見平湖一片，逶逶迤迤，聲來所在，頓覺無可踪跡。</p>

<h3>Guangdong Military Branch School Holds Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>Chairman Lin Inspects and Delivers a Speech; Yu Hanmou Delivers Instructions on Behalf of Chiang</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] The Guangzhou Branch School of the Central Military Academy held its opening ceremony at the large parade ground of the Alumni Association at the foot of Baiyun Mountain on the 1st. Chairman Chen Cheng arrived at the venue at 9:00 AM, accompanied and protected by Chen Cheng, Yu Hanmou, and senior generals. He inspected the major student corps around the field. Subsequently, Chairman Lin delivered instructions on behalf of the Central Committee, and Yu Hanmou delivered instructions on behalf of Principal Chiang. Chairman Lin spoke about the significance of Premier Sun Yat-sen's order to Principal Chiang to establish the Whampoa Military Academy and Mr. Liao Zhongkai's order to preside over party ideology education at the school, encouraging the students to realize the party's ideology and shoulder the important task of national rejuvenation. Principal Chiang's instructions were read by Yu Hanmou on his behalf. The ceremony concluded at 11:00 AM, and the entertainment began in the afternoon, dispersing at midnight. The original text of Principal Chiang's instructions is as follows: The climax of the National Revolution originated in Guangdong and Guangxi, accumulating momentum and creating this unparalleled glorious history. Considering the relationship between geography and culture, the enterprising spirit of Guangdong and the Whampoa education created by Premier Sun are the greatest mainstream. As the national crisis deepens and foreign insults become more urgent, it is our inescapable responsibility to promote the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs to save this endangered country. The establishment of the Guangzhou Branch School, in terms of system, belongs to the same body as the central government, and in terms of history, it is the successor of Whampoa. Students, cherishing the past and contemplating the future, must think about how to strive forward, inherit the past, and create an infinitely bright and splendid future. Premier Sun founded Whampoa and established the party army, teaching and cultivating talents to assist in the great cause. The spirit he proclaimed will always shine like the sun and the moon. Students studying in this land must uphold the legacy, always as if Premier Sun's earnest teachings are present, sincerely believing in the Three Principles of the People and vowing never to change. This is the first point. Guangdong was the revolutionary base area at that time and is even more so the revolutionary base for future revival and national construction. The central government's establishment of a branch school here (and the students' pursuit of studies here, its significance is doubly extraordinary. Bearing great responsibilities and aiming far, it all depends on self-reliance. Inheriting the past and paving the way for the future is not something that others can take on. This is the second point. Character has no limits, and learning has no end. One must possess a flawless personality and an ever-improving knowledge to be worthy of the name of a modern soldier. In terms of technology, one must strive to catch up, diligently study, and seek profound attainments. Furthermore, one must practice the Four Cardinal Principles and the Eight Virtues, eliminate past bad habits, and establish excellent models, which must be regarded as the sole lifelong career. Establishing oneself and establishing others are all within this scope. This is the third point. Responsibility, discipline, and mutual love and sincerity, unity, and mutual assistance are the creeds that soldiers cannot do without for a moment. I have often taught soldiers these principles, and the party member code of conduct and military reading instructions are even more specific guidelines for implementation, which should be followed closely, choosing the good and adhering to it throughout life. As times advance and responsibilities become heavier, if the foundation is not established, one will inevitably fall midway. I sincerely hope that you will persevere, advance without懈怠, and strive to fulfill our revolutionary and reforming duties. This is the fourth point. The journey is obstructed, and I cannot come in person. I specially send a few words to serve as face-to-face instruction. Students, please strive! (Central News Agency dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<h3>Tax-Exempt Imported Rice Transported to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce Submits to the Yuan, Requesting That the Original Plan Not Be Changed</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce resolved on the 1st to submit to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and Industry, requesting that the original plan for tax-exempt transportation of 4 million dan of imported rice to Guangdong not be changed, and sent letters to various organizations advocating fairness, and immediately sent a telegram stating that the central government's approval of tax-exempt transportation of 4 million dan of foreign rice to Guangdong has caused consternation among rice merchants in Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui, who suddenly sent telegrams to stop it and make petitions. The food of the Guangdong people has become a panic and tragic scene. Anyone with a heart should help. Although there is a half tax and rice from Hunan and Jiangxi coming to Guangdong, the current rice price is only seven catties for one small ocean, and the time for 青黄不接 is approaching, what can be imagined? Neighboring provinces cannot help by 指囷相助, nor can they depreciate and sell, as if the rice shortage in Guangdong has become an opportunity to advocate rights. The so-called "朱门酒食不知冻骨之悲" ignores the starvation of 30 million people. Anyone with a heart, how can they do this? At this time, if neighboring countries were to provide relief, it would also be approved, let alone the central government's benefits to the people. Is there still room for opposition? Moreover, 4 million dan of foreign rice, with Guangdong's vast land and dense population, is still not able to benefit universally. The central government seems to be planning more relief measures to avoid starvation of the Guangdong people. It is understood that the opposing remarks are only a minority of advocates. Continue to allow the tax exemption for foreign rice to save the people of Guangdong. (Special dispatch on the 1st)</p>

Zhang's telegram briefly stated that Brother Mingjie's visit to Beijing provided an opportunity for them to talk freely about Sichuan affairs, which was very pleasant. All parties' criticisms of Sichuan and personal opinions have been expressed in detail, and Brother Mingjie has returned to the province and will certainly relay them.

However, due to the persistence of old habits, abuses often arise, especially in the old prisons in various counties, which should be thoroughly improved. The repair and equipment of prisons, the treatment, hygiene, work, instruction, and security of prisoners should all be improved at any time.

If escape or prison break occurs, the head of the prison and the superior in direct supervision should be severely punished, and special penalties should be formulated for application.

<h3>The Ministers of Finance and Railways Announce the Method of Consolidating the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Loan</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Railways (or the Chinese Ambassador, acting on the orders of the government) have issued the following notice regarding the method of consolidating the Tianjin-Pukou Railway loan announced in London on February 25, 1936, and in Berlin on September 26, 1936: The notice issued on February 25, 1936, stated that the principal of the loan was approximately £6,150,000. It is found that this amount does not include the unissued 1910 Tianjin-Pukou supplementary loan bonds mortgaged to the German-Asian Bank as collateral for the bank's advances during the construction of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. According to the Sino-German exchange of letters in June 1924, the Chinese government recognized them. Now, an agreement has been reached with the German-Asian Bank to recognize the effective bonds amounting to £678,000, which are considered an original part of the 1910 loan, and retain them at the German-Asian Bank as collateral for advances, while the remaining mortgaged bonds will be cancelled. These £678,000 bonds are now only recognized as valid and will not be issued on the market, nor will they be attached with bonus tickets. The interest will be paid from the Tianjin-Pukou and customs revenues, closely following the interest of the £6,150,000 bonds. The repayment of principal will be made from the total revenue of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway by adding a percentage to the amount required for the £6,150,000 bonds. In order to prevent the current bonds' bonus tickets from being affected, the original method has been revised, and the tickets will be paid from the total railway revenue.

<h3>The Dissolution of the Japanese House of Representatives</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The Japanese House of Representatives was abruptly dissolved on the day of the closing of the 70th session of the Diet. The House of Peers, as stipulated by the Constitution, also adjourned from that day forward. On the surface, this was truly a "bolt from the blue." This is because in the 70th Diet, not only did the political parties make concessions everywhere, but even the attitude of the military seemed to have softened somewhat. The conflict between the political parties and the military was at least more relaxed than before the Diet had reconvened. Major bills such as the large budget were successfully passed in the Diet. Just a few days ago, there were widespread rumors that members of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties would unconditionally join the cabinet and assume the positions of Minister of Railways and Minister of Colonial Affairs. Many people believed that the coordination between the political parties and the military had been achieved, and the Diet would close without incident. This was not without basis.</p>
<p>However, while the political situation in Japan appeared "peaceful and uneventful" on the surface, the internal friction never really stopped. The opposition between parliamentarianism and fascism cannot be easily eliminated. Of course, we also acknowledge that some members of political parties are willing to endure temporary humiliation as long as they can retain some room for activity. But the military will not generously grant this limited room for activity. The military's ultimate goal is to completely eliminate the existing party consciousness and replace it with a government-controlled new party. The old political parties must absolutely obey the military's command in order to exist. The political parties believed that since the budget and other bills had been passed, they could exchange them for some substantive concessions from the military. However, they did not know that you take a step back, and they will take two steps forward. The political parties were forced to make a final struggle, demanding that the government recognize the amended election law and delay the review of other bills. This was inevitable. However, the military used this as an excuse to destroy the Diet.</p>
<p>There is another important factor in this dissolution of the House of Representatives, which is the maturity of the new political party. The long-brewing fascist bureaucratic government-controlled new party is said to have had new developments recently. The military, and even the government that follows the military's lead, now feels that the new party has sufficient confidence to compete with the established government in the re-election after the dissolution of the Diet. This is what the legal fascists call "legal means."</p>
<p>Even so, the established political parties will not completely die out just like that. Ando, Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, said, "Our party will fight a life-and-death battle when attending the general election." The Minseito's statement also said, "We will take the general public as our backing and expect a certain victory." At the same time, the momentum for cooperation between the Seiyukai and Minseito parties is very strong, and there is even the possibility of a merger. Although this force may not be very substantial, it still seems to have a huge resistance to a purely fascist regime. Prime Minister Hayashi said that he wanted to appeal to the "legitimate conscience of the people." Whether the majority of Japanese people sympathize with fascism can be measured by looking at the recent increase in the latent power of left-wing groups. Therefore, in our opinion, whether the new political party can achieve an overwhelming victory is very questionable. Even if the new political party uses special means to forcibly pull the election votes over, it is still doubtful whether that kind of artificially created situation can last.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government and Political Parties Prepare to Seek Direct Mandate from the People</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi Discloses Election Platform, Minseito Attacks Government's Erroneous Actions</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government has decided to hold a general election on April 30, which has been approved. Today, the following edict was promulgated in the official gazette: "I, in accordance with Article 45 of the Imperial Constitution and Article 18 of the House of Representatives Election Law, order that a general election of members of the House of Representatives be held on April 30, Showa 12." (1st, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Minseito Party issued a statement on the evening of the 31st, stating that the party has no liaison personnel such as cabinet members or parliamentary vice-ministers in the Hayashi Cabinet, which has caused inconvenience when deliberating bills. However, through hard work, the party has enabled the budget, tax system, and other bills necessary for developing national power and stabilizing people's lives to pass the Diet. About 50 items have been reviewed. However, on the morning of the 31st, when the Diet was about to deliberate the tariff bill, the government suddenly dissolved the Diet on the grounds of obstructing the proceedings, which is incomprehensible. The most important social law in this Diet, the National Health Insurance Law, and the Fuel Law, which is closely related to national defense, were about to be passed in the House of Peers. Dissolving the House of Representatives, which prevents the law from being established, is contradictory. Our party dares to ask the world's public opinion, for the sake of loyalty to the country and the people, our party will advocate a policy of reforming national affairs in the general election, and with the purification of the election, we will reveal our sincerity, and with the general public as our backing, we expect a certain victory. (1st, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi made a speech last night, in which four points are particularly noteworthy: 1) He reiterated that the political parties' views on the current situation are different from those of the government, that is, the government believes that the situation is extremely serious, while the political parties do not feel this way when discussing in the Diet. 2) The government will put forward three major policies to appeal to the fair judgment of the people, namely, to strengthen national defense, develop national power, and clarify the national polity. 3) Cabinet ministers are prepared to hold election speeches when necessary. Although the government has no intention of organizing a new party, it hopes that a new party with a thorough understanding of the current situation can be produced and cooperate with it. However, this is only a matter of cooperation between people, and there is no so-called government and party. 4) If the situation in the new Diet reflects the results of the general election and can prove that the government's understanding is wrong, then the government should reflect on itself and resign immediately. However, if the government's understanding proves to be correct, or the new situation is easy to respond to, then it will consider whether to dissolve the Diet again. Prime Minister Hayashi's above remarks can be used as a clue to infer the future development of the political situation. According to general observation, although it is extremely difficult to organize a new party, it is not easy to predict what method will be adopted. The newspapers here all expressed opposition to the dissolution of the Diet, and the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun was particularly unconcerned, and all other parties felt the same way, pointing to the government's action as a "punitive dissolution." (1st, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government today discussed the instructions of Prime Minister Hayashi at the meeting of local governors at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 5th of this month. As a result, the following three main points were decided: 1) To clarify the reasons for the dissolution of the Diet this time, and strive to make the people thoroughly understand the government's true intentions. 2) In the general election, do your best to purify the election. At the same time, in view of the deep-seated voices in the Diet criticizing the trampling of human rights, it is believed that the authorities also need to reflect on themselves. 3) The government's attitude towards this election is to make constitutional politics develop healthily and promote the political parties' self-awareness. It is necessary to advocate this purpose and seek truth from facts with the spirit of destroying private interests for the sake of public service, and not to be biased towards one party or faction, etc. (1st, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the dissolution of the Diet, the two major political parties, the Minseito and the Seiyukai, in the constituencies where they have a superior position, have made severe criticisms of the government's actions. In the other constituencies, some have expressed indifference to the new election, and some have expressed deep interest in the new election. According to the organization before the Diet was dissolved, the Diet had a total of 466 seats, divided into 204 seats for the Minseito, 171 seats for the Seiyukai, 24 seats for the Showakai, 20 seats for the Social Democratic Party, 11 seats for the Kokumin Domei, 2 seats for the Proletarian Party, 9 seats for the Toho Kai, 6 seats for others, 17 seats for the independent faction, and 2 vacant seats. Now, due to the occurrence of the new party movement and the resurgence of the Social Democratic Party, it is possible that there will be abnormally shaped members of parliament in the general election in the future. For example, former Army Minister General Ugaki is also said to be elected as a member of parliament this time, because Ugaki's hometown is urging him to join the election movement. As for the newspapers, the Asahi Shimbun said that the dissolution of the Diet was known to be inevitable, but the government should also be responsible for the inability of the people's livelihood to be stabilized. The Nichinichi Shimbun said that the people may find it difficult to understand the importance of dissolving the Diet, and the prime minister is eagerly organizing a new party to rely on. The Kokumin Shimbun said that the Hayashi Cabinet has probably expected the establishment of a new political party, so that the political field can be re-divided and the political atmosphere can be cleared. The Yomiuri Shimbun expressed dissatisfaction with both the government and the political parties, and expressed doubts about whether the future election will be clean, especially because the government is very concerned about the establishment of the new political party.

<p>[Tokyo] This month 30th is the date for the 20th election of members of the House of Representatives. According to the list confirmed on December 20th last year, the Local Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior is based on reports from local prefectural offices across the country and announced it on the afternoon of the 1st. The total number of eligible voters is 14,618,298. At the time of the previous general election, there were 14,479,553 eligible voters. Compared with the two, this time there is an increase of more than 138,000 people. It is generally believed that this is due to the natural increase in population.

<h3>Seiyukai and Minseito Plan to Form Joint Front</h3>
<p>Will the Two Parties Inevitably Merge? The Cabinet Plans to Take the Opportunity to Replenish Itself</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Seiyukai and Minseito parties echoed each other, expressing their anti-government stance and attacking the government's impropriety in dissolving the Diet. After the Diet was dissolved on the 31st, Seiyukai Secretary-General Ando proposed to Minseito Secretary-General Nagai that the government's dissolution of the Diet this time violated the constitutional spirit and that the Seiyukai and Minseito parties should cooperate to fight the government in the general election campaign in order to win a certain victory. Although Nagai did not respond immediately, he expressed his willingness to cooperate in his words. However, because this dissolution was implemented suddenly, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have not taken countermeasures for the election, and they have not been able to grasp the election funds, slogans, etc. Therefore, the degree of their cooperation cannot be estimated. However, since the government has a plan to organize a new party, and the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are united to deal with the government, the result will inevitably lead to the other step of the two parties merging. (1st, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Hayashi Cabinet is now considering countermeasures for the general election and has decided to produce a concrete plan for each policy based on the outline announced at the time of the formation of the cabinet, which will be announced in the near future in order to make the people understand the current cabinet and to obtain a majority of government party members in the general election. This move by the current cabinet is related to the movement to organize a new party and has attracted attention from various quarters. (1st, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government dissolved the Diet on the 31st and at the same time decided to study and implement concrete plans for policies from the independent standpoint of the current cabinet in order to deal with the political situation after the general election. As for the question of replenishing cabinet members, Prime Minister Hayashi has been considering candidates from an early date. Now that the situation is pressing, it is planned to appoint three ministers of Education, Railways, and Colonial Affairs before the general election is implemented. (1st, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Minister of Commerce Godo submitted the Iron and Steel Industry Law and the Pig Iron and Steel Materials Law to the Diet. Because the Diet was dissolved, they could not be established. Therefore, the Minister of Commerce was forced to establish countermeasures as early as possible to deal with the general price problem. For this purpose, the Minister of Commerce plans to launch an emergency order based on Article 22, Paragraph 2 of the Iron and Steel Industry Law. According to the provisions of this article, the government may, when necessary, inspect iron and steel industry plants, factories, warehouses, books, documents, etc., that is, this law is the most important article to establish a strong iron and steel policy and can suppress the surge in iron prices. Therefore, the Minister of Commerce's actions have a major impact on the iron industry and the future is extremely noteworthy. (1st, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Speculation on New Party Trends in the House of Peers</h3>
<p>Believed Achievable</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Count group of the House of Peers Research Society convened at the Peerage Hall at noon on the 1st to exchange views on current affairs issues, especially regarding speculation on existing political parties and new parties after the general election. The general consensus was as follows: Considering the reasons for the recent dissolution of the House of Representatives, the Social Mass Party and other proletarian parties should gain considerable influence. Regarding the new party issue, although no active movement has yet been seen, the government certainly hopes for the emergence of a new party. It appears to be a fact that the Prime Minister met with two or three influential figures before receiving the Imperial command on this matter. Therefore, this proposal will ultimately be realized, and most of it will still be centered on those within existing political parties who have a new understanding of the current situation. Furthermore, considering the number of newly elected members, it should be in the range of one hundred to one hundred and fifty. However, who will be the party leader is a problem. It is inconvenient for personnel from existing political parties, needless to say. Ideally speaking, Duke Konoe Fumimaro would be the most suitable candidate, but it is unlikely that he will run, (1st, Allied Press)</p>
<h3>Yonai and Hyakutake Promoted to Naval Admirals</h3>

<h3>Predicament of Japanese Assemblymen</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Due to the government's dissolution of the Diet, representatives of various political parties, who have fallen from their positions as Diet members in the hallowed halls to ordinary citizens, telegraphed their constituencies on the 31st, reporting the dissolution and requesting assistance. However, because the general election is only a month away, and at a time when prices are soaring, it is not easy to raise election funds. Their reliance on document-based campaigns is also hindered by a 30% increase in paper prices and the implementation of increased postage rates from today. Furthermore, alcoholic beverages have also uniformly increased in price, causing all members to feel distress. The Social Mass Party, which has traditionally appealed to the proletariat, has repeatedly encountered election battles and is unable to cope. It has decided to abandon document-based campaigns this time in order to save expenses. Printing houses in Tokyo anticipate a document-based campaign for the general election, and major advertisements have begun competition, unfolding an atmosphere of election.

<h3>Spanish War Situation Changes, Government Forces Achieve Success on All Fronts</h3>
<p>Rumors of Unrest in Rebel Headquarters: London Reports Rebel Commander Returned to Morocco; Italian Authorities Declare Adherence to Non-Intervention Agreement</p>
<p>⊙ Hengtai The Spanish Nationalist forces are under intense pressure today, both militarily and diplomatically, and are, at least for the moment, in the most difficult position since the outbreak of the civil war. Although reports from various sources are varied, the various states of unrest within the Nationalist-controlled territory are undeniable. There are signs of unrest in Valladolid, Salamanca, Burgos, Malaga, Algeciras, Seville, and even the Moroccan defense areas. At the same time, the government forces on the southern front have the momentum to wipe out the Nationalist forces in one fell swoop. The highway from Madrid to Valencia is now completely open, and the government forces are advancing towards Burgos. It is said that their planes have destroyed two rebel headquarters in the Zaragoza area. The government navy has also repeatedly attacked the rebels in the Mediterranean, with considerable success. In terms of air power, the government forces have turned the tide and gained a significant advantage. As for diplomacy, the warnings from Britain and France to the rebels not to interfere with maritime traffic further increase the momentum of the government forces. Mexico, regardless of external criticism, openly declares that it will provide further assistance to the Spanish government forces. If the situation remains unchanged, unless Italy sends a large number of troops to aid the rebels, the rebels' hopes of success are very slim. It is said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is carefully considering this matter. (31st, National Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The evening papers recently carried a report from Tangier, North Africa, stating that General Franco, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist government, indeed flew with four senior military officers to Ceuta in Spanish Morocco. (31st, Central News Agency, Havas)</p>
<p>⊙ Tangier Regarding the discovery of a conspiracy in the city of Tétouan, the capital of Spanish Morocco, the Nationalist military officials are unwilling to comment, only stating that several criminals were indeed executed yesterday, but the mutiny has been quickly suppressed. According to reliable private sources, this mutiny was connected throughout Spanish Morocco and mainland Spain. Many air force officers were also involved. The original plan was to depart from the Tétouan airfield, bomb the High Commissioner's Office of Spanish Morocco, and then fly to Alicante, Spain, to join the government forces. Unexpectedly, the matter was known to a civilian hired by a conspiring rebel officer, who reported it to the authorities. The police rushed to the airfield, at which time there were six aircraft, boarded by many officers, preparing to depart, and immediately stopped them. In total, 32 people were executed, and over 100 were arrested. Furthermore, many people have also been arrested in the ports of Larache and El Ksar el Kebir. (31st, Central News Agency, Havas)</p>
<p>⊙ Gibraltar A Nationalist captain from the port of Algeciras in southern Spain, who was ordered to execute several rebel criminals at the end of last week, recently committed suicide in his camp. The reason was not stated. (31st, Central News Agency, Havas)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid According to military news, the government forces today have entered the province of Burgos for the first time since the start of the civil war. The government forces are now advancing towards the rebel headquarters in the city of Burgos, less than 40 miles from the city. It is rumored that the rebel troops defending the city have begun a general retreat. Although this news has not yet been confirmed, it is undoubtedly true that the rebel forces on all fronts are on the verge of collapse. (1st, National Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙ Córdoba The offensive launched by the government forces in the area of Pozoblanco in this province has made increasing progress in recent days. The village of El Soldado and the railway line from that village to Belmez have both fallen into the hands of the government forces. The government forces immediately took advantage of the victory and advanced directly to a point 23 kilometers southwest of the city, and dispatched several other detachments to advance towards the towns of Villaharta and Obejo. The Nationalist forces collapsed at the sight of the government forces and fled in all directions. Many were captured by the government forces, especially Moroccan native soldiers and Italian soldiers. At the El Soldado train station, there was a train loaded with food and ammunition, which was intercepted by the government forces. When the good news reached Joann City, the local people were extremely happy and paraded in teams on the main thoroughfares to celebrate, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic. In addition, the government forces captured many spoils of war in the battle to capture the towns of Alcaracejos and Villanueva del Duque, south of Pozoblanco, the day before yesterday, including 380 rifles, 300,000 rounds of ammunition, many machine guns, a batch of gas masks, three truckloads of food, and many flags and banners, as well as a batch of propaganda materials printed in German and Italian. Upon inspecting the remains of the Nationalist soldiers left on the battlefield afterward, most of them were Italian and German soldiers and Moroccan native soldiers, and there was not a single Spaniard among them.

<p>[Rome] Minister of Propaganda Alfieri explained Italy's attitude towards non-intervention in the Spanish civil war to foreign journalists today, saying that since various countries decided to prohibit volunteers from going to Spain, Italy has strictly abided by this prohibition. Therefore, the rumor that there are Italian soldiers going to Spain is unfounded. The measures agreed upon by the Non-Intervention Committee in London must be implemented on an equal basis. If other countries break their promises and send volunteers to Spain, Italy will inevitably reconsider this matter. As for the recent rumors of a major defeat of the Italian army in Spain, it is also an exaggeration. The number of Italian troops killed, injured, and captured in the Guadalajara area is only several hundred. (31st, Central News Agency, Reuters)</p>
<p>⊙ Casablanca It is said that several hundred black soldiers from the Italian colony of Somalia, who have been in the military for a long time, arrived in Spanish Morocco today, wearing Italian uniforms and commanded by Italian officers, and are stationed in the Punte Chicao and Beni Arous areas. Another report also states that the original German technicians, pilots, and engineers in Spanish Morocco have all been replaced by Italians. All Germans have been transferred to Gamara and Algeciras. The reason for the transfer was not announced. (31st, National Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙ Tangier It was rumored that Italian army soldiers landed at Ceuta in Spanish Morocco yesterday, but it has now been learned that this news is not accurate. In addition, the city of Tétouan is very safe and secure. The rumor that General Franco, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist government, has arrived there has not been confirmed.

<h3>Annual Meeting Held at Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China</h3>

<p>[London] The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China held its annual meeting today. In his speech, Chairman Wileys touched on the current situation in China, saying that state monopolies are extremely dangerous for China's future. Mr. Wiley expressed his admiration for the completion of China's new monetary system and the increasing popularity of Chinese products abroad. However, he stated that China will soon realize the irrationality of state industrial monopolies. Mr. Wiley further stated that the Chinese people are a hardworking and resilient nation, firmly believing that the results of individual labor should be enjoyed by individuals, and that the foundation of the new assembly organization is the family system. These deep-seated views are incompatible with the theory of state-run operations, and it is believed that private enterprises are more reliable in terms of effective management and abundant profits.

<h3>New Constitution Implemented Yesterday: Autonomy in Eleven Provinces of India</h3>
<p>India and Burma Implement Separation; British King Issues Edict Concerned About People's Welfare; Nationalist Party Holds Demonstrations Against Constitution</p>
<p>[London] Today is the day when the Government of India Act stipulates that autonomy will be implemented in the eleven provinces of British India, and Burma and India will implement separation. The British Emperor specially issued an edict to the people of India and Burma, stating that he is determined to care for their happiness and regard their future welfare. In the article regarding India, it stated, "A new page of history has now begun. We earnestly hope and pray that the current opportunity will be utilized in a clear and generous manner to seek the lasting welfare of all the people of India." For Burma, the British Emperor hopes that the region can find a path to long-term happiness and prosperity in its new constitution. Today, the British Emperor also bestowed the Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George on the Governor of Burma, Sir Cochrane. The provincial autonomy now being implemented in India includes more than two-thirds of the total land area of India, and the population within the autonomous territory exceeds 290 million people. Each province has a government that is responsible to the elected Legislative Assembly and clearly stipulates a broad scope of administration. The central government has no right to interfere in administrative affairs within the prescribed scope. Except for certain matters specifically stipulated in the laws, the governors of each province must follow the advice of government officials. The implementation of the new constitution in Burma involved the Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, presenting the Burmese Senate with a silver scepter as a symbol of the separation of India and Burma. Lord Linlithgow also earnestly hoped that Burma could understand the conduct of Burmese public affairs in the coming years, which is based on the parliamentary administrative system, and that this would be appreciated. Another impact of the change in the Indian constitution is that Aden's affiliation with the Indian government, which has lasted for nearly a century, is now severed, and it becomes a part of the colonial empire. However, on the day the Aden colonial government was established, the British Emperor's edict to the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the region stated, "The commercial links and personnel exchanges between Aden and India will remain as usual."

<p>⊙ New Delhi Today is the day when the new constitution of British India began to be implemented, and the Indian National Congress organized large-scale demonstrations, general strikes, and general market shutdowns to show their opposition. The Calcutta Company has passed a resolution to stop work, schools are also closed for one day, and newspapers are not published. The police department issued a notice that the police can provide assistance to those who do not wish to strike or stop business but are forced to do so. Assam Province has now formed a coalition cabinet in accordance with the constitution, with two Muslims, one Hindu, and one Indian Christian. The chairman is the Muslim, Sa'adullah, who has been a member of the Assam Legislative Assembly since 1933. The National Congress Party of the province is the largest party in the Assam Legislative Assembly, but it has declined the invitation to form a cabinet because the headquarters of the National Congress Party had a proposal that the Governor must agree not to exercise his constitutional privileges before the Congress Party can cooperate. The demonstration has now passed peacefully. This morning, six people were arrested in Bombay for obstructing traffic, and 25 people were arrested in Delhi for this reason.

At the same time, because April 1 is the implementation date for provincial autonomy, British India has organized minority party governments in four of the six provinces where the Congress Party has won a majority. (31st, Ziran Daily, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙ Calcutta Although the government has prohibited prominent Congress Party leaders from organizing large-scale marches and demonstrations, the leaders are still continuing their efforts and plan to implement the anti-constitution day tomorrow to express their opposition to the constitution and plan to announce a boycott.

<h3>Opening of the Political Conference of the Little Entente</h3>
<p>Comprehensive Review of the Central European Situation to Be Conducted, with Particular Emphasis on the Economic Structure of the Danube River</p>
<p>⊙ Capital City of Yugoslavia The Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente is scheduled to open today. The Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia, Mr. Krofta, and the Foreign Minister of Romania, Mr. Antonescu, arrived here together at 9:30 this morning. The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of South Korea, Mr. Stojadinović, the Minister of the Army and Navy, General Marić, and many other dignitaries welcomed them at the station. Krofta then made a statement to the press, saying that South Korea has recently held a leading position in several important international events, and this Standing Political Conference will discuss the impact it may have. "But there are no resolutions of a surprising nature, and the covenant on which the Little Entente was founded is not acceptable. Please do not expect it." (1st, Central News Agency, Havas)</p>
<p>⊙ Capital City of Yugoslavia The Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente is scheduled to open here tomorrow. The Czech Foreign Minister Krofta and the Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu have both arrived here. It is expected that this conference will last for two days before it ends. The importance of its nature is above the previous conferences, because in recent months, Britain and Italy have signed the Mediterranean Gentleman's Agreement, and Italy has adopted a new attitude towards the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria (according to the Italian side, the time for the restoration is not yet ripe (and is trying to get closer to the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, so the political situation in Central Europe and the Danube River region has undergone major changes, and should be comprehensively reviewed at this conference. The most important issue that the three foreign ministers of the Little Entente will jointly explore is the future economic structure of the Danube River region. Recently, Italy and Yugoslavia signed an economic agreement, and Yugoslavia and Hungary, and Czechoslovakia and Austria, are all seeking mutual cooperation in the economy. Therefore, although the three countries of the Little Entente and the three countries of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, which signed the Rome Protocols, each established their own economic groups, they have now begun to interact with each other. Therefore, the Little Entente Conference should find a way to lay the foundation for economic cooperation between the two major economic groups in Central Europe that are currently evenly matched. As for the political aspect, it is generally expected that the Little Entente Conference will clearly stipulate the common policies of the Little Entente countries in the future, and try to reconcile two different points of view. The so-called two different points of view are: one is the point of view of Czechoslovakia, which advocates further expanding the scope of the existing mutual assistance obligations between the three countries of the Little Entente based on the principle of collective security stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant; one is the point of view of Yugoslavia, which obviously advocates that the Little Entente countries should separately conclude bilateral agreements with other countries.

<p>[Vienna] The Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia, Hodža, has been visiting here for a week. After meeting with the Prime Minister of Austria, Schuschnigg, again on Saturday and Sunday, he will return to his country immediately. The President of Czechoslovakia, Beneš, will also pass through Austria to visit Yugoslavia, but does not intend to stay here. Politicians here are now focusing on the Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente, believing that the establishment of the Little Entente originally had a negative goal, in other words, to resist Hungary's claim to revise the Treaty of Trianon. Up to now, the Little Entente is shouldering a positive task, in other words, to promote a policy of coordination and easing the situation in Central Europe. (1st, Central News Agency, Havas)</p>

<h3>Davis Arrives in London</h3>
<p>American Ambassador to France Returns to His Post</p>
<p>[London] It is widely rumored here that as a result of talks between the American Envoy Davis and Eden and Chamberlain, the United States may convene a world peace conference. Mr. Davis came to England this time to attend the International Sugar Conference and arrived here today. However, Mr. Davis also intends to meet with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, so it is believed that Mr. Davis's mission is not limited to attending the Sugar Conference. (31st, National Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The International Sugar Conference will be held in the Locarno Room of the London Foreign Office next Monday. 23 countries will participate at that time. The purpose of this conference is to consider ways to adjust the supply and demand of sugar. The American representative, Davis, arrived in Plymouth last night to attend this conference. It is said that the main purpose of the Sugar Conference is to find a plan that will enable sugar growers to make a slight profit without the current loss, and at the same time, the price of sugar will not increase greatly, without harming consumers. Mr. Davis then spoke about the general economic difficulties in the world, saying that the United States is prepared to join any policy that can reduce tax rates. Although there is no tendency to disarm in Europe at present, the United States is prepared to cooperate with other countries when the image is better in order to reduce armaments and maintain peace.

<p>⊙ Beijing The leader of the Belgian delegation, Mr. Putin, has departed for England to attend the Sugar Conference. According to well-informed sources, the conference seems to be about to conclude an agreement to adjust production and consumption to stabilize sugar prices. However, other parties are also worried that Japan's attitude towards the Chinese market will cause difficulties, because the status of Java sugar and Cuban sugar will be affected. If Java and Cuba refuse to participate, the international agreement cannot be established. (31st, National Haitong Telegram)</p>

<h3>American Labor Strikes Rise and Fall One After Another</h3>
<p>Coal Miners Brew Strike; 300,000 Will Participate</p>
<p>[New York] The contract previously signed between coal miners and mine owners will expire at 11:00 PM tonight. As the mine owners are unwilling to renew the new contract with the United Mine Workers, more than 300,000 miners have decided to announce a strike tomorrow. The continuous rise and fall of labor strikes in the United States proves the trend of the American labor movement. The leader of the coal mine strike is John L. Lewis, chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization. He rushed here immediately after leading the auto industry strike in Detroit. Without even having time to rest, he led miner representatives to hold a labor-management meeting with the mine owners today. Their primary demand is for the employers to recognize the union and sign a new contract with it. Lewis declared after today's meeting, "No contract, no work." However, labor and management will continue the meeting at 4:00 PM tomorrow. Whether the strike will occur depends on this meeting. The union representatives also demanded that the annual working days be set at 200 days, the daily wage at six dollars, the weekly working hours at 30 hours, and two weeks of paid vacation per year. The employers hope to extend the weekly working hours and maintain the current wage levels. Under Secretary of Labor McGrady is prepared to arbitrate if necessary. The date on which Lewis will return to Lansing to meet with Michigan Governor Murphy and Chrysler Corporation Chairman Chrysler to discuss resolving the auto industry strike has not been announced.

Regarding the section criticizing internal party work, it states: "We must not indiscriminately attack genuine Trotskyite saboteurs and comrades of our party who previously opposed us but have now repented." Furthermore, "The establishment of a democratic system within the party is essential. Workers in all industries, regardless of whether they are party members, must continue to supervise their leaders, and national leaders must also be subject to the supervision of the people. The people's right to supervise is exercised during elections. Leaders should also be criticized for their faults, even if those who are hostile to the Soviet Union use it as fodder for gossip." Furthermore, "Since we must train the masses, we must go deep among the masses to train ourselves. Some leaders, on the pretext that party members lack sufficient understanding of Marxism, expel them from the party. This is wrong." (1st Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Northeast China Massacre Large Numbers of Our Patriotic Fighters</h3>
<p>Over 300 Arrested in Andong Puppet Provincial Area; 195 Have Been Brutally Killed</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: In recent years, the people of Northeast China have suffered from inhumane oppression, and as a result, patriotic resistance movements have risen and fallen, one after another, with renewed efforts. Although the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters, the Military Police Headquarters, and special agencies have jointly made every effort to search, arrest, and kill countless people, the people, oppressed beyond measure, all hold the determination that living is worse than death. Even though they witness the cruelty of the martyrs and righteous men being executed, they still do not waver in their will to recover the land. Among those in North Manchuria, the anti-Japanese forces of Xie Wentong, Zhao Shangzhi, Kong Xianwu, and others in Ning'an, Dongning, Yilan, Fujin, Huachuan, and Raohe are the strongest. In South Manchuria, due to the mountainous terrain, the Soviet experimental zone in Huanren and Ji'an has the greatest influence. Apart from these two branches, the people's front is generally hidden in the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. Among them, the intellectual class is the center of activities. Last year, when the news of the Suiyuan resistance against Japan reached Northeast China, the patriotic fervor of the people, who had been under prolonged suppression, became even more intense, and the land recovery movement became more active. Last winter, the Kwantung Army, in order to trap the Huanren Soviet experimental zone for a long time, implemented a blockade policy, designating Fengcheng, Andong, Huanren, Ji'an, Xiuyan, Zhuanghe, and other places as its attack areas. The Andong and Huanren land recovery and patriotic movement was detected by the Japanese military police due to careless communication. In early January of this year, the Japanese and puppet military police in the Andong puppet provincial area were fully mobilized to search. More than 314 people were arrested, including more than ten high-ranking officials from the current puppet Andong Province and puppet Fengtian Province. Sun Wenshu, the Director of the Education Department of the puppet Andong Province, and Jin Wenbin, the Magistrate of the puppet Kuandian County, were also among them. At the same time, countless local gentry, wealthy merchants, and businessmen were implicated. The Japanese and puppets separately reported and organized a military law court within the puppet First Military Region for the convenience of interrogation. During the interrogation, the 314 captured righteous men suffered all kinds of torture. It was not until recently that the trial was completed. Among them, 195 were dealt with in accordance with the so-called Punishment of Traitors Law. It is reported that they were killed last week. 54 were sentenced to imprisonment, with terms ranging from three to twelve years. Another nine died under torture. 56 are still under investigation. It is also reported that more than 30 people in the Jilin education sector were arrested in this case and have been executed. Although the Japanese puppets have wantonly massacred patriotic righteous men in Northeast China, they have still failed to quell the patriotic sentiments of the 30 million people. The people in the cities and towns of the four northeastern provinces, as well as in the remote countryside, are longing for relief from their suffering. Therefore, they are all taking actions to break free from their bonds. Although the Japanese puppets want to arrest and kill them, they are already overwhelmed. Therefore, the Japanese military police and officials are busy day and night searching for anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese elements, and they are especially strict in restricting travelers from the interior from going to Northeast China.

<h3>Glimpses of the Southern Tour (II)</h3>
<p>— Junshi</p>
<p>A nation with a low level of culture is only fit to live a poor life, to be oppressed and controlled; while a so-called civilized nation, the darling of heaven, is of course the enjoyer, the controller, and the oppressor. This is probably the universal truth, no need to doubt it! After we set foot on the South Sea Islands, the Malay people we saw were fortunate enough to be able to work as mid- to lower-level clerks in the railways, post offices, or government agencies. The number was not large. This is the ruler's method of using barbarians to control barbarians. Besides those who can obtain this kind of favor, they are all farmers, miners, coolies, and general humble occupations. Driving carriages, driving cars, and serving as male and female servants are their specialties.</p>
<p>The Malays' enjoyment of life is extremely simple. In a climate with year-round high temperatures, clothing and housing can be casual. Men and women both wear a long skirt called a "sarong" on the lower body, which hangs down to the ankles, but with different patterns. They wear short tops, no longer than the knees, made of fabric or silk, with red, green, and floral patterns (the same for men's clothing). The brown-black faces and bright clothes complement each other. Most men and women are barefoot; the nobles wear clogs like slippers. Men wear hats year-round; those who believe in Islam wear cylindrical hats. The hats of the Javanese are made of floral cloth, and each region has its own specific style. Those with jobs, such as railway and postal workers, wear uniforms, and after putting on their floral cloth hats, they also wear a uniform cap on top. The women of Malaya have their hair hanging behind their heads, like in our country in the old days. They also wear a sarong, scarf, or shawl on their heads, only revealing their faces. It is said that in the past, women who were beautiful were in danger of being robbed when they went out, so they had to cover their heads and faces. On the island of Bali in the Dutch East Indies, women generally expose their upper bodies and do not wear short tops. The same is true for women in other places such as the Batak in Sumatra and the Sakai women.</p>
<p>Women are very particular about ornaments, ornaments, brooches, necklaces, earrings, bracelets, anklets, etc., all must be worn.</p>
<p>The houses of the Malays are mostly located in remote coastal areas several miles from the city, forming their own tribes. The form is similar to Japanese houses, with wooden pillars, and the roof is covered with leaves of the aba (a type of palm tree). The floor is four feet above the ground. The front balcony is used to receive guests; the middle is the bedroom, and the corridor behind is the kitchen. Short ladders are used for ascending and descending. Livestock can be raised under the floor.</p>
<p>In terms of food, it is considered the most important thing in their entire lives. They like spicy food the most. They don't eat like us with bowls and chopsticks, or with Western-style knives and forks. They put rice on banana leaves or plates and use their fingers instead of chopsticks, but only the right hand (because the left finger is used to wash the anus when defecating). They mix the vegetables and rice with their hands and put them in their mouths.</p>
<h3>Papua Natives</h3>
<p>Chewing betel leaves is a special habit of theirs (this habit is very common throughout Southeast Asia, not exclusive to Malays). Whether men or women, they chew it during leisure or after meals, as if smoking cigarettes has the same effect. These betel leaves are the leaves of an herbaceous plant, large as the palm of the hand, heart-shaped. When eating, they are mixed with betel nut, gambier, white lime, etc. and chewed in the mouth. The taste is astringent and spicy. After eating, the mouth is full of red marks, and the teeth are also red and black, which is extremely terrifying. Betel leaves are not only for one's own chewing, but also used to treat guests. When guests arrive, they are served with betel leaves in a wooden box for the guests to take. The elderly with teeth also have a bamboo tool to crush the betel leaves in the tube before putting them in their mouths. However, modern fashionable women no longer chew betel leaves to protect their teeth.</p>
<p>Those who believe in Islam, in accordance with Islamic customs, have a month of fasting every year. During this month, regardless of age, food is prohibited from sunrise to sunset, and even drinking water and chewing betel leaves are not allowed. Eating and drinking are only allowed at sunset, strictly adhering to the rules. After the fasting month is over, a grand feast is held for the whole family to eat together, just like our reunion dinner.</p>
<h3>Wang Guogacha, League Chief of the Ikezhao League, Goes to Shanxi</h3>
<p>— Reportedly Discussing the Construction of the Guihua-Shouxian Railway in Shanxi and Suiyuan —</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: Wang Guogacha, the League Chief of the Ikezhao League, along with more than 30 staff members, took a special train on the PingSui Railway on the 29th, passed through Zhangjiakou to Peiping, met with Song Zheyuan, the Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission, stayed for a short time, and then took the PingHan Railway via Shijiazhuang and transferred to the Zhengtai Railway to Taiyuan to visit Yan Xishan, the Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi and Suiyuan, to report on the situation of the Mongolian administration. He also plans to go to Nanjing.</p>
<p>According to Wang's statement when passing through Zhangjiakou, "Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces have now become the front line of national defense. The development of transportation construction should be promoted urgently. The authorities of Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces have all realized this. It has now been decided to build a section of railway from Guihua to Shouxian. The required funds total about 5 million yuan. After the entire Tongpu Railway is completed and opened to traffic in September of this year, all the assets of the railway will be mortgaged to the Shanxi branch of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank. Wang Ping, the Director of the Finance Department of the Shanxi Provincial Government, has obtained the consent of all parties in Beijing. Construction can probably begin within this year. The situation in Mongolia is extremely peaceful. The troops of Jin Xianzhang, who defected and returned, have been reorganized into the newly編第二師 and have been stationed in Gaoping County in southeastern Shanxi Province since the 27th of this month. After I arrive in Peiping, I will stay for a short time and meet with Chairman Song and others, and then I will transfer to the well and report the situation of the Mongolian administration to Director Yan, or I may go south to Beijing. This has not yet been decided." (29th)</p>

<p>Two Boats Collide, Almost Causing Disaster</p>
<p>Zhuang Shaoji, a chicken merchant from Bingshan, bought more than 500 chickens from Changshu at around 10:00 AM on the 30th and hired a boat to transport them to Shanghai for sale. When passing through the river outside the North Gate of this county, a large Yuan Da steamboat towing six cargo ships came speeding along. Because it was too late to avoid them, they collided violently. The chicken boat suddenly capsized, and all four crew members and more than 500 chickens fell into the river. Fortunately, nearby farmers managed to rescue the crew members, and they were able to survive. As for the lost chickens, a compensation of 100 yuan was paid.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Police Team Captures Lake Bandits</p>
<p>The Water Police Team of the county police station recently received a secret report that the lake bandit leader Qin Er, had gathered more than 20 bandit boats and planned to rob the temple pilgrims on the 31st. After receiving the report, the team leader led more than 20 patrol officers and policemen, disguised themselves, and went to Renzigang, a place bordering Wuxi. They took another small boat to Dongshan to investigate. At that time, the bandit leader Qin Er and his wife, and his younger brother A San, had already learned that the police team had arrived and immediately jumped into the lake and swam to escape. The police opened fire to pursue and arrest them, and finally captured the bandit leader and his accomplices. They were strictly guarded. The team leader and others then continued to capture the bandit party Zhang Defa and his son Zhang Yonggui, along with a bandit boat, in Shilubang, a place bordering Wujiang County. On the morning of the 30th, they were escorted to Wuxi and transferred to the police station on the 31st for interrogation.

<p>Court Continues to Interrogate Adultery Case</p>
<p>After the adultery case occurred in the county's drug rehabilitation center, the male and female students were taken into custody by the court. The case has been investigated by prosecutor Ren twice. However, the inside story of this case is extremely complicated. In addition to going to the drug rehabilitation center to investigate, prosecutor Ren summoned six people yesterday, including the female doctor Xu Huaiyu, the servants Qi Hong, Yang Ma, Li Ma, Shen Gen, and Jin Aju, as well as the female opium addicts Sun Wang, Wang Zhou, Wang Lu, and Fan Zhou, who were transferred and inspected at the same time as Hua Jinglan, to the case for interrogation. According to Sun Wang and others, the doctor Zheng Fuxi did call Hua for rape on the evening of the 23rd of last month. Hua refused, so he used his power to send her to the county government for treatment and punishment. They also said that Zheng used his contemptible tricks and threatened with authority to engage in teasing and playing whenever he encountered opposite-sex debugging and detoxification with better-looking faces. The black curtain in the institute was all done by Zheng Fuxi alone.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Long-Distance Buses Collide</p>
<p>The fifth bus of the Zhen Dan Jin Automobile Company, driven by chauffeur Gao Zixian, was fully loaded with passengers and heading to Jintan at 4:00 PM on the 29th. When it reached a place about two miles from the Hujiaqiao in Nandan, the tenth bus, also coming from Jintan, came head-on. Unexpectedly, the two sides failed to give way properly and collided violently. The iron awning of the fifth bus fell off on the spot. The company immediately sent personnel to the scene of the accident, carried the dead passengers into the city, and placed them in the Xiaogong Temple at Shenjiaqiao. The injured passengers were transported to the obstetrics and gynecology hospital for treatment. At the same time, the county was notified, and the drivers Xu Fengsheng and Gao Zixian were sent to the county for custody in order to be punished according to the law.</p>
<p>Maoshan Incense Boat Sinks</p>
<p>Every year when spring warms up, the Maoshan incense season is very prosperous. The day before yesterday, a water-drawing boat towed two boats carrying incense-burning men and women to Danyang. Because it was already late, they anchored near the Dachemen Bridge. Unexpectedly, the water-drawing boat was already damaged, and the bottom of the boat was leaking. The boatmen discovered it and tried to remedy it, but it was unsuccessful. The boat sank soon after. Fortunately, the boatmen escaped ashore and were not drowned.</p>

<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Petition to Reduce Land Tax Surcharges</p>
<p>The land tax surcharge in Nantong has been increased several times, exceeding nine times the tax. As a result, the land rent received by the landowners is not enough to pay the grain tax. The people are struggling to bear the burden. Everyone regards owning land as a burden. Sun Songtao and others from the county petitioned the Finance Department to reduce the land tax surcharge. The department has approved the county's report that the land registration will soon be completed before the land registration. It is now planned to organize a land value tax. All the surcharges should be considered and resolved together when the land value tax is reorganized.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Petition to Exempt Construction of Tangqiao Road</p>
<p>Tangqiao Road in the Tudian area of Jiaxing has been surveyed and staked by the construction section of the county government. The road base is stipulated to be 8 meters. The route starts from the Tangqiao Township Office, passes through Shujiaqiao, Wanjia Stone Bridge, Yuejie Bridge, and reaches Guojie Township, connecting with the Hangshan Highway, losing nearly a thousand mu of farmland. Moreover, construction needs to start immediately, which will damage crops such as beans, wheat, mulberry leaves. The local farmers, suffering too much damage, led by farmers Feng Hanshou, Wang Tianshou, Xu Amei, etc., more than 60 people, led by township chiefs Shen Shixi and Shi Feizhang, went to the county government yesterday to petition for exemption from construction. Secretary Ling Jifu received them. After the villagers stated the pros and cons, Secretary Ling said that according to the Fengcai Road method, the road surface would be reduced to two and a half meters, that is, the original rural road would be widened, and the original wooden bridge would be replaced with wooden piles, so as to avoid losses to the farmers. The villagers were satisfied and left.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Buzheng Lane Bizarre Blood Case</p>
<p>Lin Jianqiu, a resident of No. 12 Buzheng Lane in the western suburbs of this city, has a son and two daughters. The son, Xinghui, is now a household tax collector in the county government. The eldest daughter, Meijuan, is twenty years old and is in love with Feng Changgui, a teacher at the nearby Jingjin Primary School. They live together in his house and have not yet officially married. The younger daughter, Menghua, is still young. The family employs a maid, Zhang Cai, who is 25 years old. At 6:00 PM on the 29th, Jianqiu's son-in-law and younger daughter Menghua went to the Zhongnan Theater to watch a play. Meijuan did not go because she was pregnant. She was accompanied by the maid at home. At about 9:00 PM, two uninvited guests came and knocked on the door. After the door was opened, the two rushed inside and asked if Mr. Lin was there. The maid replied that he was out. They asked if the eldest sister (Meijuan) was there. Seeing that the situation was not good, the maid shouted loudly. Unexpectedly, the visitors extinguished the lights and tried to go upstairs. The maid stopped them. One of them took out a sharp knife and stabbed the maid's right arm wildly, and covered her mouth with his hand. The maid was strong and fought desperately with the assailant. At this time, Meijuan heard the sound and shouted for help upstairs. Fearing arrest, the assailant fled through the door. Afterwards, a new bayonet scabbard and a hemp rope were found on the ground. The police station in charge of the area took them back for research in order to arrest and punish the murderer. The truth of this incident is not yet known.</p>
<h3>Taizhou</h3>
<p>Hui Society Life and Death</p>
<p>On the 16th of the Wenling Jiaotong township, there was a parade for the idol competition. Taiwan's pavilions, stem bearers, stories, gongs and drums, flags and weaves, etc. numbered more than 2,000 people. On the way through the Lo Qi Bridge, there were a large number of viewers, and they walked through the fields, causing the planted wheat to be crushed into the soil. The owner, Shao Jinfab, could not bear to see the damage to the objects. He immediately asked them to walk on the road, which angered the crowd and they attacked each other. Seeing that the situation was not good, Jinfab fled. Unexpectedly, the crowd still chased him to the river bank. Because there was no way to go, he went into the water to avoid the attack. Because he was not familiar with water, he drowned. When his family heard the news, they came to rescue him, but he had already died and was lying stiffly on the surface of the water. His family reported to the local court, which sent people to investigate and verify the body on the 18th.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang's Speech: During the tea party, Mr. Wang rose and delivered a farewell speech, saying, "The coronation ceremony of the British monarch is exceptionally grand, and the diplomatic relations between China and Britain have always been harmonious. Therefore, our country's representation at the coronation ceremony is extremely important. The current Special Envoy to the coronation ceremony is Deputy Director Kong. Considering Deputy Director Kong's knowledge, morality, reputation, and status, I deeply believe that we have chosen the right person. Although Deputy Director Kong's government affairs are heavy in the country, this mission is so important that he resolutely decided to go. I hope that Deputy Director Kong will further promote harmony in Sino-British relations during this trip, and after returning to the country, contribute the gains from this trip to the nation. I would like to raise a glass to wish Deputy Director Kong, Deputy Envoy Chen, Secretary-General Weng, and all the members of the delegation a safe journey."</p>
<p>Mr. Kong's Reply: Subsequently, Mr. Kong rose and gave a reply, saying, "I am honored to be appointed as an envoy to Britain to congratulate the British monarch on his coronation. I am humbled by Minister Wang's farewell speech. This time, I will sincerely attend this grand ceremony, which is rarely seen in the world today. In addition to representing the country to congratulate the British monarch, I also wish to represent the government and the people to express our sincere enthusiasm to the British government and public, so that the friendly relations between the two countries will become even more harmonious. After the event, I plan to visit various countries on the way back to China to inspect various construction projects as a reference for China's economic construction. Minister Wang is a veteran diplomat, and I hope that he will not hesitate to give guidance on everything during this trip, so as to avoid making mistakes."</p>
<p>Farewell Banquet by Financial Circles: The financial circles of this city held a banquet at the International Hotel's second floor yesterday (the 1st) at 7:00 PM to bid farewell to Special Envoy Kong, Deputy Envoy Chen, and their accompanying counselors and specialists, as well as Xiao Zhenying, who is traveling abroad on the same ship. Those listed include leading figures in the banking and money industries, such as Song Hanzhang, Chen Hang, Hu Bijiang, Xu Kan, Wu Yunzhai, Du Yuesheng, Zhou Zuomin, Ye Fuxiao, Xu Jiqing, Ye Zhuotang, Fu Rulin, Tang Shoumin, Wu Qiding, Qiu Yanshan, Qian Xinzhi, Lin Kanghou, Zhou Shouliang, Xu Xinliu, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Xiaolin, Feng Gengguang, Zhang Rongpu, Mei Zhezhi, Zou Bingwen, etc. Friends of Mr. Kong who joined temporarily included Xu Shiying, Li Zhaohuan, Qin Zhen, He Dekui, and over a hundred others. A Western-style meal was served, and the guests and hosts took their seats in order.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: During the banquet, Xiang Wu Yunzhai delivered a farewell speech on behalf of everyone, saying, "Special Envoy Kong, Deputy Envoy Chen, and distinguished guests, today, colleagues from the financial industry in Shanghai have jointly gathered to bid farewell to Special Envoy Kong, Deputy Envoy Chen, and distinguished guests who are going abroad to attend the coronation ceremony of the British monarch, as well as Mayor Xiao, who is traveling abroad on the same ship. This event was originally initiated by colleagues from the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association. Because the departure date of Special Envoy Kong and the others was suddenly advanced, many friends of Special Envoy Kong, Deputy Envoy Chen, and others joined temporarily to bid them farewell together. Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of our Banking Association, is unfortunately recuperating in Moganshan due to illness, and Mr. Shao Yanshan, Chairman of the Money Industry Association, is too modest to speak. As one of the standing committee members of the Banking Association, I have been asked to say a few words. Over the years, Special Envoy Kong has dedicated himself to the party and the country, working diligently for the nation. His accomplishments are numerous, and people at home and abroad admire him. In particular, we colleagues in the financial industry have seen that in recent years, during this time of domestic and international turmoil, our country's finances have gradually gotten on track. Since the success of the legal tender policy, the market has been very active, and industry and commerce have shown a thriving atmosphere. Various construction projects have made great progress. It can be said that these great achievements are mostly due to Special Envoy Kong's leadership. Now, Special Envoy Kong, with the qualifications of a founding member of the party and the country and a leader in finance, and with Deputy Envoy Chen's prestige in the navy for many years, has been ordered to go abroad as an envoy, which represents our newly emerging country. This is a great honor for our country's position, and the friendship between China and Britain will surely be greatly enhanced as a result. Not only does our entire country feel fortunate about this, but the British side also welcomes it sincerely. I have heard that Special Envoy Kong, Deputy Envoy Chen, and the others will also visit various countries in continental Europe to inspect finance, economics, and construction projects. Accompanying them on this trip are politicians, experts in railway construction, experts in economics and finance, and experts in international trade. It is expected that when they return to China after completing their inspections, they will have made great gains to help our nation's revival. The responsibility and significance of this mission are so great, so we sincerely wish you all success, which is also wishing for the prosperity of our country and nation's future. Special Envoy Kong, Deputy Envoy Chen, and the others, this time traversing the ocean, are also doing a part of the hard work for our country and nation, and we should really thank you. I sincerely ask everyone to raise a glass to wish Special Envoy Kong, Deputy Envoy Chen, Mayor Xiao, and all those traveling with them a healthy journey and successful endeavors."</p>
<p>Envoy Kong's Reply: Next, Special Envoy Kong delivered a speech in response, saying, "Today, I am grateful to the colleagues from the banking and money industries for hosting this banquet to bid farewell to me and my fellow travelers. I am deeply moved by your kindness and would like to express my gratitude on behalf of myself and my colleagues. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy in our country, industry and commerce have prospered, and the market situation has stabilized. This is all due to your assistance, which made it possible for us to succeed. I have been working hard for the country and the nation, and I dare not take credit for any contributions I have made to the country's finances or any development I have made to the social economy. I am going abroad this time, and you are still concerned. But I dare to tell you that the things that should be done now are all in progress. For example, the reorganization of the Central Bank into a reserve bank will soon be realized. Various bills have been established to balance the national budget and strengthen the banking system. Last year, industry and commerce made profits, and politics became more stable. Now, Chairman Chiang's health is getting better and better, and there is someone to lead the political affairs. And the social undertakings are presided over by all of you. I deeply believe that the development of the country's future and the stability of the economic organization are very promising. I hope that all people in the government and the public will unite sincerely and work hard for the country and the nation. As the old saying goes, 'When a thousand people are of one mind, they can break gold.' I also hope that you will give me guidance at any time so that the mission of my trip abroad can achieve its purpose. Finally, I wish you all prosperous careers and good health." After finishing his speech, he shook hands with the hosts to express his gratitude and then took his leave. Wu Yunzhai and Lin Kanghou escorted him to the door and then returned to their seats. The guests and hosts spoke happily, and the banquet did not end until late at night.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association Held a Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the Increase in Taxes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association heard about the proposed tax increase earlier and held several meetings to discuss it. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, it convened the 24th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees and invited representatives of various members to attend and discuss the matter together. Those present included Shen Weiting, Jing Yimeng, Shen Yankang, Ding Houqing, Sun Lishan, Wu Linzhi, Xie Jishan, Chang Qinggui, Liang Zhidong, Yu Renqin, Chen Qitao, Liu Jiyun, Wang Meifu, Ge Xiongfu, Li Xuedong, Wang Xingtang, Wang Ruilin, Gu Zhongying, Lin Zhaopin, Li Xianping, and Hang Jizhang. Shen Weiting presided over the meeting, and after the ceremony, the chairman reported on the progress of the petition to the Taxation Bureau, saying that the Taxation Bureau had now informed the association by letter that the two-level tax system would be changed to a four-level tax system from April 5th. For cigarettes with a registered price of 800 yuan or more per 50,000 cigarettes, the first level will be taxed at 800 yuan; for those with a registered price of 400 yuan to 800 yuan, the second level will be taxed at 400 yuan; for those with a registered price of 200 yuan to 400 yuan, the third level will be taxed at 200 yuan; and for those with a registered price of less than 200 yuan, the fourth level will be taxed at 100 yuan, and so on. Then, discussions began. It was generally believed that handmade and hand-operated machine-made private cigarettes had not yet been eliminated, and the government wanted to implement a tax increase, which would place a heavier burden on cigarette merchants and make it difficult for them. However, considering the government's hard work in construction in recent years, which required funds everywhere, the cigarette merchants had to bear the burden. Moreover, the Taxation Bureau had indicated that it would gradually remedy the refund of taxes on moldy cigarettes and other difficulties for cigarette factories within the possible scope, so the cigarette merchants should abide by the new tax system. After a long discussion, the chairman put it to a vote, and it was passed without objection. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Grand Occasion of Three Medical Events Yesterday</h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony of the New Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital Building, Completion Ceremony of the New National Shanghai Medical College Building, and the Fourth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Medical Association</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of the new Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital building, the completion ceremony of the new National Shanghai Medical College building, and the opening of the Fourth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Medical Association, three ceremonies, were jointly held at 2:00 PM yesterday in the auditorium of the Shanghai Medical College. The Maple Bridge was bustling with traffic, and the congratulators filled the courtyard, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. It was heard last night that a social gathering was held at the International Club, and the atmosphere was extremely lively. Details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: The attendees included Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan; Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Department of Health; Duan Xipeng, Vice Minister of Education; Wang Zhengting, Ambassador to the United States; Xu Kan, Vice Minister of Finance; Sun Kuifang, Director of the Forensic Research Institute of the Ministry of Judicial Administration; Qi Shounan, Dean of the Medical College of Central University; He Bingsong, President of Jinan University; Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Command; Chen Xing, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank; Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers Association; Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs; Shen Qing, Director of the Bureau of Public Works; Li Tingan, Director of the Bureau of Health; and leaders from all walks of life, including Du Yuesheng, Liu Haisu, Chen Tiesheng, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Binyan, Ma Yinliang, Wu Liande, and Ding Huikang, as well as thousands of members of the Chinese Medical Association, etc.</p>
<p>Grand Opening: At 2:00 PM, the ceremony began as scheduled. First, Chairman Kong, the Vice President, delivered a speech, followed by speeches from Vice Minister Duan, President Zhu, and Hengbi. Then, President Yan (Fuqing) reported on the security arrangements of the two institutions. Mao Yun, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Liu Hengrui, the Director of the Department of Health, delivered speeches one after another. Wang Zhengting then delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of all the guests, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony: The attendees then proceeded to the front of the Zhongshan Hospital's main gate for the ribbon-cutting ceremony. A red satin ribbon was tied across the main gate, with the national flag hung on either side. Vice President Kong, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Song Ailing, and guests from all walks of life, stood in front of the gate. Mrs. Kong cut the ribbon with scissors, and the main gate was opened. Afterwards, the guests went to the auditorium for refreshments and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Kong, Vice President of Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, said in his speech, "Humans are inevitably subject to illness and pain, and if they seek to be cured, then medical affairs are paramount. This is why our country in the past elevated the merits of good doctors to those of good ministers, and why the Premier personally initiated the Republic to alleviate the suffering of the people, all stemming from his art of saving lives. The Three Principles of the People pay particular attention to public health, highlighting the importance of medicine and the value of human life. Shanghai is a diverse meeting place for people from all over. The population is large, diseases are prone to occur, and the cost of foreign hospitals is high, and the treatment methods are unfamiliar. For those below the middle class, if they suffer from illness, they are helpless and at a loss. With over three million citizens, the number of hospital beds is less than five thousand, which not only fails to provide adequate medical care but also falls short of addressing the people's suffering. Therefore, in 1930, it was proposed to establish Zhongshan Hospital to continue the Premier's legacy of saving the people. A preparatory committee was established with Xiangxi as the director, and leaders from all walks of life in the country were invited to participate. Xiangxi took on the task and consulted with those in charge to form groups to raise funds domestically. The Rockefeller Foundation in the United States donated over 130 acres of land on Rue Père Robert, stipulating that the land could only be used as a hospital foundation, and the construction costs had to be borne by the Chinese people. Therefore, colleagues formed the Shanghai Medical Affairs Board, with Xiangxi as the chairman, and Sun Zhesheng, Ye Ziheng, Qian Xinzhi, Liu Hongsheng, Lin Kanghou, Yan Fuqing, and the late Shi Liangcai as executive directors. Mr. Yan Fuqing was appointed as the general manager to prepare for the establishment of Zhongshan Hospital. Active fundraising efforts raised over 554,850 yuan, enabling the acquisition of 100 acres of land south of Maple Bridge in the spring of 1935, where construction began. The hospital buildings were completed in the winter of 1936, with 500 beds. The outpatient clinic can simultaneously diagnose 500 patients. Diagnosis and hospitalization are divided into departments, and medical equipment is largely complete. The site is adjacent to the National Shanghai Medical College, with magnificent buildings facing each other. The hospital serves as a training ground for the college, while also meeting the medical needs of the society. Cooperation and mutual support promote the advancement of scientific endeavors. In the winter of 1932, Mr. Ye Ziheng, a Ningbo gentleman living in Shanghai, donated the Ye Garden in Jiangwan, covering over 80 acres, to be converted into a sanatorium for lung diseases, named Chengzhong Hospital, in memory of his father, Chengzhong. Since its establishment in the spring of 1933, Chengzhong Hospital has increased beds and equipment, with donations from various parties exceeding 100,000 yuan. It has 150 beds, but the demand far exceeds the supply. In the autumn of 1936, leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai planned to establish the Qiaqing Hospital in memory of Mr. Yu Qiaqing, adjacent to Chengzhong Hospital, raising over 100,000 yuan. Construction is planned with 120 beds for the treatment of lung diseases, complementing Chengzhong Hospital. The administrative system of Chengzhong Hospital is also under the board of directors and serves as the Second Teaching Hospital of the National Shanghai Hospital. Furthermore, the Leprosy Hospital in Dachang and the Epidemic Hospital on Yuqiaqing Road cooperate with the Shanghai Medical College in providing medical services, both meeting the local medical needs and providing practical training for medical education. Since the establishment of Zhongshan and Chengzhong Hospitals, they have provided some relief for the medical needs of the people. Although their facilities are no different from other medical institutions, what we are fortunate about is their establishment purpose and the spirit of those in charge, which are worthy of praise. Please allow me to briefly describe them. The land and construction costs of Zhongshan and Chengzhong Hospitals were donated by all sectors of society and should serve the public widely, striving to achieve great results at the lowest cost. Therefore, most of the beds are designed for the common people, which is commendable. First, the hospital serves the common good, and the doctors, nurses, and staff are willing to devote their energy to serve the world. Both Zhongshan and Chengzhong Hospitals are led by Mr. Yan Fuqing, who is full of vigor and dedicated to sacrifice. Mr. Yan is able to lead by example, striving to serve the medical community and promoting Mr. Niu Huisheng to preside over Zhongshan Hospital, demonstrating that medical affairs are a public asset, and no one is more suitable than Mr. Niu. Mr. Niu, despite his long illness, took on the position of honorary director, and his spirit of service is even more admirable. This kind of ethos is worthy of emulation by the medical community. This is commendable. Second, Zhongshan Hospital and Chengzhong Hospital are both teaching and training grounds for the Shanghai Medical College. Teachers and students cooperate and work hard on research, combining the dual meanings of diagnosis and teaching. This is also different from general hospitals. This is commendable. Third, Shanghai is the medical center of our country, and well-known medical experts from various countries come and go. Now that we Chinese people have this self-established medical academic institution, we can occupy a considerable position in the international arena. This is commendable. Fourth, alas, it is often difficult to start something, but easy to continue it. The establishment of a hospital by the Chinese people in Shanghai has been desired for a long time, and now it has been completed. The joy of the Shanghai celebrities in praising its completion is unparalleled, and Mr. Yan Fuqing's overseeing of the matter, tirelessly and taking serving the people as his duty, is even more unparalleled. I hope that those who hear the news and are inspired will promote this great cause and build hospitals to alleviate the suffering of our compatriots across the country. This is what Xiangxi prays for day and night. On the occasion of the opening of Zhongshan Hospital, I hereby describe the establishment of Shanghai's medical affairs and what it is based on, so that I can inform the benevolent gentlemen of the country."</p>
<p>Vice Minister Duan's Speech: Duan Xipeng, Vice Minister of Education, said in his speech, "I am very happy to be attending this grand ceremony today. This achievement is the result of countless people's efforts in spirit and material resources. I have two thoughts on this: First, the Shanghai Medical College has only ten years of history. In the beginning, everything was very simple. Later, it became somewhat established, but then it was almost completely destroyed during the 'January 28th' incident. Fortunately, Dean Yan's hard work and the spiritual and material assistance from Chinese and foreign people enabled it to have a relatively solid foundation today. With this achievement in just five years, its future prospects are undoubtedly expected. Second, the completion of the new school building is not only a material success but also a significant improvement in teaching and research, which is a spiritual achievement. For example, medicine has only a hundred years of history in China, and the period of running schools is less than fifty years. Although it is not yet fully developed, it already has a considerable foundation. The new school building of the Shanghai Medical College has a good environment, so it will definitely have great development in the future. It can carefully study and contribute in academic theory, not only make contributions in Shanghai but also extend to the whole country and penetrate into general villages so that the general public can enjoy the happiness given by new science. I hope that colleagues in the medical field can truly unite and be truly responsible, serving the nation and the country, so that the entire nation can enjoy health and happiness. National health is the starting point of national rejuvenation, so medical colleagues should make medical affairs flourish and expand."</p>
<p>President Zhu's Speech: Zhu Hengbi, President of the Chinese Medical Association, said, "Today (the day of the completion ceremony of the National Shanghai Medical College building, the opening of the Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, and the opening of the Fourth Congress of the Chinese Medical Association, jointly held), Hengbi should first represent the Medical Association, stand in the position of a guest, and congratulate the Shanghai Medical College on the completion of the new school building and the Zhongshan Hospital on beginning to serve the community. On the one hand, I respectfully thank the Medical College and Hospital for lending the venue for the meeting. Recalling that the Medical Association has held four congresses since merging with the Medical Missionary Association of China, the first was held at the newly established Lester Institute of Medical Research in Shanghai, the second was held at the newly built Department of Health and Central Hospital building in Nanjing, the third was held at the newly renovated Boji Hospital in Guangzhou, and this time it is held here. The venues for each congress are all large-scale medical institutions, which shows that China's medical affairs have made great progress in recent years, which was unattainable in the past. Furthermore, the Shanghai Medical College, where this meeting is held, has made great ambitions to promote the meaning of the word 'medicine' and include all personnel who can work to improve the health of the people in the ranks of the college's cultivation. Last year, it added a medical and pharmaceutical vocational training course and a senior nursing vocational school to train pharmacists and nurses. In the future, it will continue to add a dental vocational training course and a public health specialty to train dentists and public health service personnel, in order to support the government's active promotion of medical education and comply with the recognition and advocacy of new medicine shared by all countries in the world. The Medical Association feels that holding this meeting here is more meaningful than the previous ones. It is hoped that the next meeting can be held in a newer and greater medical institution, which will not only be a blessing for the Association but also the glory of Chinese medicine. Those of you present are either people in the medical field or not. People in the medical field must have long been aware of the Chinese Medical Association. Non-medical people, then, often fail to understand its organization and situation. Hengbi now has to briefly state it once and talk to you. The Chinese Medical Association has a history of twenty-five years. Seven years ago, it merged with the Medical Missionary Association of China, which was founded by foreign doctors in China. The Medical Missionary Association had a long history of forty-five years before the merger and was very well-organized. After the merger, the number of members has increased to three thousand, without political implications and without factional concepts. A congress is held every two years. At the congress, most of the time is spent on scientific research, and a very small amount of time is spent on discussing association affairs. The members are all outstanding people in the medical field. All domestic health officials, hospital directors, and medical school directors are members of the Medical Association. There are eight hundred foreign doctors because science should not have international boundaries, and medicine has long broken national boundaries. Therefore, all research work in the association is made equal for foreign members to study together. However, all the power in the association is in the hands of domestic members. This is a major feature of the Chinese Medical Association. The association publishes two magazines in Chinese and English. The Chinese magazine specializes in promoting medical knowledge in China, and the English magazine specializes in making contributions to medicine in the international arena. Libraries in any country in the world have the English Chinese Medical Journal, and medical journals in various countries regularly extract the essence of the English Chinese Medical Journal as part of their data. This is a small contribution of the Chinese Medical Association in China and the world. Furthermore, the Chinese Medical Association has always advocated teaching medicine in Chinese, so it is committed to compiling and translating medical books, which is very motivating. Nearly a hundred books have been completed and sold widely, and it seems to have made a small contribution to the medical culture in China. The above are all the points that you should pay attention to in the Chinese Medical Association. Your time is very precious, and what is said today will stop here. If you are interested in studying medical papers, then the Medical Association will have group discussions for seven days starting tomorrow, and you are very welcome to join the meeting for joint research.

<p>Wonderful content, a rare and valuable historical commemoration, as well as Guangzhou Special and Scout Grand Review and other films. Fundraising of 100,000 to be completed within the year. Iron Blood Loyalty, a Large-Scale War Film.</p>
<p>Produced by the Film Section of the Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission</p>
<p>The Film Section of the Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission is the only film organization that shoots military education films for the government. Over the years, it has produced hundreds of types of film news and educational short films, all of which are valuable films of great contemporary significance. The section's mobile screening team takes them to various military divisions and rural areas across the country for screening. In response to the requests of domestic cinemas, the section has screened newly completed films one after another in the Central Cinema in Hankou, Shanghai Cinema, and the Xindu, Guomin, and Shoudu Cinemas in Nanjing, as well as in Xi'an, Luoyang, Nanyang, and other places, all of which have been warmly welcomed by the audience. Especially when it was screened at the Guomin Assembly Hall in the capital last month, it was unanimously praised by military organs, school officials, and students. Recently, in response to the invitations of major cinemas in Shanghai, Luo Jingyu, the group leader, specifically transported the famous films to Shanghai and contacted the cinemas to arrange for the screening to be enjoyed by audiences from all walks of life in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Screened Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Grand Theater in Shanghai is the only large cinema in the East. Mr. Zhu Boquan, the manager of the theater, because he saw that domestic news films were warmly welcomed by the audience, and Shanghai is especially related to international perspectives, is very willing to introduce the progress of our country's military and other aspects of construction to the audience in Shanghai. He specifically contacted the section and planned to select and add them before the feature films, and especially planned to add various important news films at any time in the future. At 10:00 AM yesterday (the 1st), a trial screening was held at the theater, including "Xi'an Incident Album," "Guangzhou Special," "National Scout Grand Review," "National Army Autumn Military Exercise," "President Chiang Kai-shek's Aphorism Education Cartoon," and military news and construction news films such as the Central China Games. Cai Jinjun, the police chief of Shanghai Municipal Government, Hu Hengzhuang, the curator of Shanghai Museum, representatives of Shanghai Air Defense Association, and celebrities such as Ye Gongchao, as well as people from the film and news industries, a total of seventy or eighty people, arrived. The screening was completed at 10:15 AM. The audience praised the shooting skills and the content of the news. Especially, they admired the "Xi'an Incident," "Guangzhou Special," "Scout Grand Review," "Aphorism Cartoon," and "National Army Autumn Military Exercise" as rare works.</p>
<p>Content of Each Film</p>
<p>The content of the "Xi'an Incident" includes various aspects before and after President Chiang Kai-shek was in distress, such as the scenic spots of Huaqing Pool, the cave in Guishan Mountain where he was detained, the place of residence, and the situation of flying from Luoyang to Beijing after escaping danger, the line of the march in Luoyang, and the indignation of the people across the country after hearing about the incident. The joyous scenes of the people celebrating day and night after Chiang escaped danger were also filmed, all of which are valuable historical commemorations. The "Guangzhou Special" is divided into episodes. The first episode includes the construction of new Guangzhou and the beautiful scenery and revolutionary historical sites of southern China, such as the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang and the artillery platform used by Chen Jiongming to bombard Guanyin Mountain and the Presidential Palace. Among them, the Whampoa Military Academy, the birthplace of our country's revolution, is the most valuable. The shooting skills of the film, with many shots taken from airplanes, allow viewers to not only save the labor of traveling and visit the scenic spots of Lingnan but also have the interest of touring Guangzhou by air. The second episode includes the grand welcome of President Chiang Kai-shek to Guangdong and the joy of visiting his revolutionary hometown. The situation of him implementing the New Life Movement, prohibiting smoking and gambling, and handling Guangdong affairs after arriving in Guangdong is also filmed. The closure of the large casinos in Guangzhou is especially a spectacle. The joyous scenes of Li Zongren flying to Guangdong to visit President Chiang Kai-shek, as well as various military and political figures such as Chen Cheng, Xiong Shihui, Ju Zheng, Cheng Qian, and Zhu Peide, are also filmed. Among them, there is also a report from the late Guangdong Chairman Huang Musong on the process of drug prohibition, and Cheng Qian's personal report to the people on the process of mediating the peace movement is even more rare. In addition, President Chiang Kai-shek's aphorism cartoon is a logical presentation of President Chiang Kai-shek's revolutionary philosophy, which is of great educational value. The National Army Autumn Military Exercise and the National Scout Grand Review are even more meaningful for national defense.</p>
<p>Recent Developments</p>
<p>The section has recently dispatched a special photography team to the front line of national defense in Suiyuan to shoot "National Army Spring Military Exercise, Cavalry Performance," and "Memorial Service for Martyrs Who Died in the War Against the Enemies," which will be completed soon and screened for the people of the country. The section also, in view of the need for active progress in our country's domestic feature films, specifically organized the "Wuhan Film Studio." The factory site is located in Yangsen Garden in Yihé Village, Hankou, and the scale is very grand. After years of preparation, the equipment in each technical department has been completed. All machines are the latest and most scientific devices, which can be called the most complete sound film studio in China. The first work will be a war film about the army, navy, and air force, with the title "Iron Blood Loyalty." The production capital is scheduled for 100,000 yuan, under the overall supervision of He Junshan, director of the Political Training Department, with Zheng Yongzhi as the supervisor, Yuan Congmei as the director, and Wu Weiyun, Luo Jizhi, and Wang Zhongxi as the photographers. The technical director of the entire film will be Luo Jingyu, who will be responsible for the design and sound recording. In addition to the basic actors Dai Hao, Zhu Mingxian, Yu Jingyuan, and Hong Hong, etc., trained by Wang Ruilin, the leader of the film troupe, the male and female protagonists are currently being selected. Because the scenes in the play are very large, other minor roles are being entrusted to the famous playwright Xiong Foxi to recruit on his behalf in Ping. When the film is produced, the national army, navy, and air force will be mobilized to take on the war scenes. The exterior scenes will be set in Suiyuan and other border provinces, and preparations have already begun for everything, with the goal of completing it by the end of this year. It will surely be an unprecedented masterpiece of domestic war films.</p>

<h3>Soon After Engagement, They Lived Together, But Suddenly Filed for Dissolution of the Contract</h3>
<p>The Dispute Between Dong Mingzhen and Xu Cifu: The Case Was Concluded Yesterday and Sentencing Was Scheduled</p>
<p>Dong Mingzhen, a Ningbo native woman residing at No. 22, Shen Yu Lane, Tiantong Road, North Zhejiang Road, is 22 years old. She used to study at Zhiren Yong Girls' School, with the school name of Dong Lili. In October of last year, she met Xu Cifu, a local who was formerly a secretary of the World General Assembly. They fell in love at first sight, and on the 15th of that month, both parties, through a matchmaker, got engaged at Hong Shihao Law Firm, with lawyers Li Lingtong and Sun Minhou as witnesses to the marriage contract. Because of the intense feelings, they began living together before the marriage. Unexpectedly, after only a few months, they had a falling out. Recently, Dong Mingzhen hired a lawyer to request the dissolution of the marriage contract with Xu Cifu from the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, as well as the return of her belongings. At 2:30 yesterday afternoon, the case was heard by Judge Mo Runhua in Civil Court Six. Xu Cifu hired lawyer Jin Ximing to defend him, and Hong Shihao, Li Lingtong, and Sun Minhou were also summoned to testify. According to Dong Mingzhen's statement, she used to study English at Zhiren Yong Girls' School with the Western name Lili. After Dong met the defendant last autumn, he pursued her. She then agreed to his request and got engaged on October 15th of last year. Immediately after, they cohabited at his home. Unexpectedly, within three days, she offered some advice because the defendant's behavior was improper. She was immediately insulted and beaten, and two pieces of clothing were torn. On February 22nd of this year, after having dinner together at the Xinzheng Restaurant in the Garbage Bridge, he threatened her with a handgun, saying that if she did not listen to him, he would use the gun against her or throw sulfuric acid at her. Terrified, she dared not resist. From then on, the defendant's abuse and insults became more and more frequent. If she were to continue with the marriage contract, her lifelong happiness would be unimaginable. Therefore, she requested the court to dissolve the marriage contract and return a radio, a box, a silver hairpin, and clothing, silk quilts, and other items. Questioned, the defendant Xu Cifu stated that the plaintiff used to be a female guide at the Daxin Company's cover flyer guidance agency, named Dong Lili, and later was a dancer at the Paris Ballroom. That is how they met. Because of the harmonious feelings, they got engaged. Later, she lived with my parents and others, and there was no abuse or threats with a handgun. Because I lost my job after working at the World General Assembly, the plaintiff began to discriminate against me and went out on her own without permission. To this day, I do not know where she lives. Now, I do not want to dissolve the marriage contract and request to continue living together. Lawyers Li and Sun proved the marriage contract, which was signed by them. A month ago, Dong Mingzhen came to the law firm and stated that she wanted to move out with Xu Cifu to form a family; otherwise, she would file for dissolution of the contract. After our persuasion, Dong and Xu reconciled as before, and there was no mention of threats. Lawyer Hong Shihao also testified that he and Xu Cifu's father have a friendly relationship. I have never met Dong Mingzhen, and I do not know the details. After mutual arguments from both lawyers, the court ordered the sentencing to be scheduled for the 5th of this month.</p>

<h3>Western Newspaper Reports on Shanghai's Moral Issues</h3>
<p>About 25,000 People Engaged in Prostitution</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Chinese Public Opinion Weekly published in this city yesterday contained a detailed report on the League of Nations conference on the suppression of trafficking in women and children held in Bandung.

The deceased's father, Zhang Tongtai, reported to the General Patrol Police, who ordered the detectives to arrest Qiao and send him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Zhang's body was sent to the autopsy room, and the prosecutor of the First Special Court went to examine it. Because the cause of death was unclear, an autopsy was required. Yesterday morning, the case was heard by Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Court of the Special Court. Qiao Yinglin hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the deceased Zhang Guiyu had been dissected by court physician Zhang Yan. According to the physician's report, although there was a wound on the deceased's head, it did not damage the bones or brain. The cause of the deceased's death was poor treatment after the injury, resulting in death due to illness. Therefore, the defendant in this case should not be held responsible for causing the death of another person. However, the responsibility for minor injury cannot be avoided, but according to the law, minor injury requires a complaint to be filed. Therefore, the court should ask the deceased's family whether they need to file a complaint to determine whether the police should prosecute the defendant. Judge Feng then summoned the deceased's wife, Zhang Li, and father, Zhang Tongtai, to court. Both claimed that they did not want to file a complaint and expressed that the defendant should pay them money. Police lawyer Wang and defendant's lawyer Fan requested that Qiao be released since the deceased's family did not want to file a complaint. However, when Zhang Tongqin heard that the court was going to release Qiao, he stated that he must file a complaint because he would not be able to get money if Qiao was released. Judge Feng, seeing that Zhang's intentions were undecided, adjourned the case for two days and instructed the police to inquire about the true intentions of Zhang Tongtai and Zhang Li before making a decision.</p>

<p>The Firewood and Charcoal Sales Industry Association of this city previously requested the Municipal Public Works Bureau to expand the adjacent shoreline of the original three wharves for the convenience of shipping charcoal to the port and unloading it, and to designate it for the berthing and unloading of charcoal sales ships. The Association rented it for use by fellow traders, but the ongoing expenses increased as a result. Therefore, the commission for the sale of firewood and charcoal was set at 8.8 fen per yuan.

<h3>A Young Woman Abducted to Another Place Cries in a Theater</h3>
<p>Discovered by a Tea Room Employee on the Same Ship, the Truth is Uncovered. The Abductor is Detained and the Woman is Brought Back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The abductor, Li Jinbao, is twenty-four years old and from Yancheng, Jiangbei. Recently, he seduced Zhang Qiu, a woman from his hometown, in Shanghai. His accomplice, Zhang Sikuai, also seduced a girl named A San from the same hometown. The two criminals colluded and boarded the Yihe Company's North China Ding Sheng steamboat a few days ago, taking the two women to Dalian, intending to sell them into brothels as prostitutes. When the ship arrived in Tianjin, it docked for four days as usual before setting sail again. The two criminals took Zhang Qiu and A San to a theater to watch a play. Although Zhang Qiu was persuaded by their sweet words, she was inevitably homesick in a foreign land and couldn't help but burst into tears. At that time, Li A Si, a tea room employee on the Ding Sheng steamboat, was also watching a play in the theater. Seeing that Zhang was a passenger on the ship, he paid close attention. Taking the opportunity when she returned to the ship, he inquired about her background and learned that Qiu was the sister of Qiu A Rong, a dock worker at the Huashun Wharf in Shanghai, who had mistakenly fallen into the hands of the abductors. He then arrested Li and took the plaintiff and defendant back to Shanghai. However, Zhang, seeing that things were not going well, took the abducted A San and fled ashore in Tianjin. The Ding Sheng steamboat arrived at the port at 7:00 am yesterday. He then reported to the Customs Water Patrol Room, and detectives Xu Juelu and Zhou Zenghua were dispatched to board the ship and take Li, Qiu, and her brother Qiu A Rong to the police station. According to Li, he confessed that on the fifth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, he and his accomplice Zhang Sikuai, who was at large, abducted a girl named Yang Xiaomei in Daya, Zhabei, and sold her to a brothel in Tianjin for 150 yuan, which they divided between them. According to Zhang Qiu, she is twenty-two years old, from Yancheng, and lives at No. 17 Shuiping Lane, Linping Road, Zhabei. Her husband makes a living pulling a rickshaw in Wuxi. She worked at the Lake Silk Shop on Tianbao Road in Shanghai. One day, she went to see a play at the New Stage in Zhabei and was seduced by the defendant in every possible way. She didn't know that he was an evil abductor, etc. After verifying the confession, the police chief ordered the detectives to continue to arrest the remaining accomplices for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Cheng Xiuling's New Book: English Dictionary of Chinese Opera</h3>
<p>Ms. Cheng Xiuling, a lawyer, has recently written an English book "Chinese Opera Dictionary." The book collects various photos of Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Shang Xiaoyun, Ma Lianliang, Jin Shaoshan and other famous actors in casual and costume dramas. The content is extremely rich, and various facial makeups and props are painted in five colors, which is particularly beautiful. The whole book is divided into three parts. The first part is a general discussion of the evolution of Chinese opera. ㊀ Theater, ㊁ Opera costumes and props, ㊂ Musical instruments, ㊃ Character facial makeup. The second part focuses on expressions, postures, and acting skills, with illustrations. The third part selects fifty recently popular Chinese operas, explaining the plot. The printing is excellent and the language is fluent. According to Ms. Cheng, the origin of compiling this book is that some British and American friends are very fond of Chinese opera, but they do not know the Chinese plot and performance, but only admire the names of actors such as Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu, but do not understand the meaning of the play. She often asked Yu (Ms. Cheng referring to herself) to explain and write in detail. Mr. Mei once went to Russia to perform two years ago, which was very popular, but foreign audiences always felt that they were scratching an itch, so she specially compiled this book, which took two years to complete. It was printed by Bifashop Bookstore on Nanjing Road. In the future, when Mr. Mei and Ms. Cheng go abroad to perform, this book will definitely be of great help to Europeans and Americans, so that Chinese opera can have a considerable understanding of the international status and Europeans and Americans. This book has 240 copper plates and 54 color plates. It is really a masterpiece in the Chinese opera world. Although there were one or two English Chinese opera books before, they were not as detailed and beautiful as this book. Ms. Cheng is a top student of the Sino-Western Girls' School, and she is proficient in English. She especially likes to study literature and drama. After graduating, she served as a teacher in her alma mater. Then she studied law at Soochow University. After graduating, she worked as a lawyer. In her spare time, she devoted herself to compilation and writing. She also specialized in comparative criminal law at the Soochow Graduate School and obtained a master's degree this summer. She will go to the United States in the autumn for further study.</p>
<h3>A Wife Accuses Her Husband's Mistress of Disrupting the Family</h3>
<p>Zhu Songshou, a Suzhou native living at No. 31 Dongxin Lane, Maitian Road, French Concession, married Pan Xiayun in the past, and their relationship was very close. However, Zhu was fond of fishing for sex. In April of the old lunar calendar last year, he was introduced by Zhang Shushan to Huang Rulin, a Ningbo native living upstairs in Wantong Tiyuan at No. 126 Zilaihuo Street. Huang is twenty years old this year and cohabited in a pavilion at No. 5 Xinan Lane, Jiumudi. After a few months, Zhu became disgusted. In September, there was a verbal conflict. Zhu beat Huang severely and then abandoned her. After Huang reported to the Chenxiangge Police Station, he was summoned and persuaded the two parties to reconcile. After mediation by friends, they reconciled as before and cohabited at No. 10 Lixian Lane, Zilaihuo Street. Zhu's wife, Pan Xiayun, learned about this and led many people to move all the furniture away. Zhu, fearing his wife's power, no longer went there and did not care about Huang's living expenses. Recently, Zhu Pan Xiayun filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Huang Miaolin of disrupting the family, leading to a happy family, and being instigated by Huang to alienate the husband and wife and the mother-in-law. The plaintiff's family happiness has been damaged by the defendant, and he does not know where he is going. He requested that the defendant be punished with the crime he deserves. According to the complaint, the court summoned the two parties for trial by Judge Qiu Huanshi yesterday morning and instructed them to wait for another hearing.</p>

<h3>Japanese Medical Expert Collects Valuable Chinese Medicine Materials</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, Dr. Ochi Shinichi, a professor at Kyoto Medical University and a world-renowned expert in endocrinology, who was dispatched by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' China Cultural Affairs Department to study Chinese secret recipes, has been investigating the Yangtze River coast in Nanjing and other places with the support of the Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences for a month. He has collected more than 100 kinds of valuable raw medicinal materials related to endocrinology from all the family secret medicines in Chinese folklore, and will take them back to study hard. It is expected that after Dr. Ochi returns to China, he will make a significant academic contribution to the single-prescription and unique-flavored miracle drugs that have been used in China for thousands of years. It is reported that Dr. Ochi has collected more than 100 kinds of raw medicinal materials, mainly animal-based, and also a large number of plant-based materials related to alcohol. In particular, the animal-based purple river car is a dried placenta taken from the corpse of a woman. This substance is difficult to obtain in Japan due to legal regulations. Other examples include white flower snake, tiger's genitals, seahorse, hippocampus, praying snake's eyes, tiger's eyes, clams, dragon's claws, yellow human monkey dates, sea dog kidney, blood remainder (woman's hair), etc., which are all wonderful medicines from ancient China and have not yet been scientifically proven. In the future, it is worth examining why these raw medicinal materials can nourish and strengthen the body.</p>
<h3>Workers at British-owned Public Welfare Yarn Factory Went on Strike Yesterday Morning and a Conflict Occurred</h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the British-owned Public Welfare Yarn Factory at No. 150 Robert Sheng Road (road built across the boundary), Shanghai, previously had a disturbance. After the party and government agencies jointly issued a notice, ordering the resumption of work, the labor-capital treatment conditions have not been resolved due to the insistence of both parties. All workers of the factory jointly announced a go-slow at 6:00 am yesterday. A misunderstanding occurred between the workers and the Chinese police sent by the Gordon Road Patrol House, resulting in a conflict. Nineteen workers were injured. The factory has now issued a notice announcing the closure of the factory. The workers have decided to send representatives to the party and government agencies this morning to petition for assistance. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Original Conditions The entire workers of the Public Welfare Factory are now in a strike. The party and government agencies have conducted mediation, but it has not been resolved due to the different opinions of both parties. The eight conditions are as follows: ㊀ The factory must cancel new employees. Except for the engineer, the factory can select experienced people to fill the position. All must be promoted by experienced old workers. ㊁ The factory must guarantee that workers will not be dismissed. ㊂ When workers ask for leave, if their work is done by other workers, the full wages for the part done must be paid. ㊃ Do not increase work. If the work is increased, it should be doubled according to the original wages. ㊄ The factory must organize a workers' club, which is responsible for the workers' representatives, so that workers have the opportunity to relax and entertain themselves in their spare time. ㊅ The factory must restore and increase the one-tenth of the wages and the two cents of the half-subsidy that were reduced last year. ㊆ The wages during the last strike period will be paid as usual. ㊇ The factory must sign a contract after accepting it to abide by it.</p>
<p>Disturbance The yarn department of the factory has 1,000 female workers on day and night shifts, 360 male workers on day and night shifts, 700 female workers on day and night shifts in the weaving machine room, and 170 male workers on day and night shifts, totaling 2,230 people. Because the factory refused the workers' eight conditions, they expressed their indignation. Therefore, at 6:00 am yesterday, after the day shift workers entered the factory, the night shift workers did not leave the factory, and they jointly announced a go-slow. The factory then notified the patrol house on Gordon Road to send more than 20 detectives to suppress them. However, just because the Chinese manager of the factory, Qin Defang, and the detectives of the patrol house gathered in one place to talk, the workers upstairs opened the windows to watch and suddenly dropped a small wooden board on the window onto the patrolman. The patrolman bravely went upstairs to question the workers. All the workers, seeing the patrol house coming upstairs, panicked and rushed down the stairs. The patrolmen downstairs heard the news and gathered and went upstairs, and a conflict occurred between the two sides.</p>
<p>Police Suppression After the misunderstanding occurred, the detectives reported to the Gordon Road Patrol House by telephone, and immediately sent more than 20 Chinese and Western police teams to suppress them in two police cars. At the same time, the Yulin Road Patrol House also sent more than 80 reserve teams to suppress them in four police cars. Therefore, the workers were even more panicked and rushed to escape. At the same time, Gu, the patrol officer of the Gordon Road Police Station of the Police Bureau, also led more than 10 policemen to rush to the factory. Because the factory refused to enter the factory, it was impossible to provide protection, and the medical authorities of the concession believed that the situation was serious, and sent 80 foreign merchant groups to rush to the factory in four police cars. Seeing that the workers had dispersed, they immediately withdrew.</p>
<p>Workers Injured After the disturbance occurred, the Chinese and Western Alarm Team of the concession arrived. During the disturbance, there were Xie Xiaoyou, Huang Mingsan, Xi Asan, Wang Xiaosheng, Chen Zhuo, Xu Jing Er, Wu Jingyuan, Chen Fangfang, Shen Huicheng, Wu Weizi, Wang Jinkui, Ding Wenhan, Xu Ada, Zhang Xiaomei, Xi Shaotang, Xia Xiaoshunzi Zhu Ami, Ge Jinshe, Zhao Yulong, and other male and female workers, 19 in total, who were all injured in the head. The Gordon Road Police Station of the Police Bureau immediately called the Zhongshan Hospital of the Renji Hospital to send an ambulance to rescue them. Eleven of the seriously injured were sent to the ward of the Zhongshan Hospital, and the eight slightly injured were discharged after being bandaged by the Renji Hospital. During the disturbance, the Western foreman of the cloth machine room, Grelisi, and the Chinese employee of the tube room, Zhu Putian, were also slightly injured in the head. It is learned that the eleven workers who went to the Zhongshan Hospital for medical treatment were treated yesterday afternoon. Because there was no danger to the head injury, they were all discharged after being bandaged.</p>
<p>Factory Notice Yihua Foreign Firm, a British company, posted a notice at the gate of the factory at 1:00 pm yesterday, saying: Our firm is in the Public Welfare Factory, and unscrupulous workers have taken the liberty to close the car this morning, causing trouble and causing a disturbance, which makes it impossible to drive. We have no choice but to implement the closure of the factory. It is hereby decided to pay all the wages of all male and female workers in the factory from 9:00 am on the 9th of this month. This is a notice from Yihua Foreign Firm, April 1.</p>
<p>Petition This Morning After the incident occurred, all the workers of the factory pushed out representatives to gather in No. 7 Minsheng Lane, Bairinan Road. It was decided to continue to demand that the party and government agencies negotiate with the factory based on the original eight conditions and have pushed out seven responsible representatives. They are scheduled to go to the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, and the Social Bureau at 10:00 am this morning with the 19 injured workers to petition for assistance in mediating to avoid the expansion of the dispute.</p>

<p>Bureau's Admonition</p>
<p>After the workers' side received the approval order from the Social Bureau at about 9:00 pm the night before, the committee for requesting improved treatment convened an emergency representative conference to discuss the order. More than 100 representatives attended the conference. The workers thought that the original wage request of 20% had not been achieved, and the 14 important conditions related to wages had been cancelled. They unanimously expressed their unwillingness to resume work. However, in order to respect government decrees, it was decided to hold a large-scale petition yesterday morning, requesting the withdrawal of the order to increase wages by 10% and cancel the order on matters related to wages. Continue to mediate and discuss many other important cases. At about 1:00 pm yesterday, 120 petition representatives from the workers, including Zhang Yuezhen, gathered at the Social Bureau to petition. Eight general representatives were selected from the representatives of each factory. At about 12:00 pm, Section Chief Xu of the Third Section personally received them. For the workers' request to withdraw the order, in order to maintain the authority of the government, he expressed that it could not be done. If the workers think that the content of the cancelled conditions is important and must be negotiated again, they can handle it as a separate case after resuming work in order to seek remedy. After lunch, Xu personally went to the gathering place of the workers' petition representatives to transfer the story, roughly saying that the national industry must be protected with all efforts, and the labor and capital parties should cooperate earnestly. At the same time, he also reported the various difficulties in handling this case. The factory side still found it difficult to confirm the general wage increase of 10%. He hoped that the workers would understand this situation and resume work immediately, and must not have any recurrence of the situation. Otherwise, the government will severely punish it. At about 3:00 pm, the representatives promised to convey the government's opinions to the workers and returned together.</p>

<h3>Qian Yunhe's Patriotic Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Qian Yunhe, a painter from Wuxing, formerly known as "Sick Crane," served as a strategist and compiler for newspapers such as Minli and Minquan, advocating revolution without fear of authority. His reputation has long been established at home and abroad. Later, he suffered from the Shanghai Incident, and his family property was completely destroyed in a fire. Fortunately, he has a wise son, Xiaohe, who takes care of him in Beijing. He still amuses himself with painting and calligraphy. Now, at the age of sixty, he is still in good health. Unable to sit idly by in the face of national crisis, he has meticulously painted many historical national heroes and new life-related historical facts to arouse the public's enthusiasm for patriotism. Last year, he held solo exhibitions in Beijing and Zhenjiang, achieving remarkable success. Now, at the invitation of old friends, he has supplemented his collection and brought more than 200 new and old works to Shanghai for a solo exhibition. His daughter, Ms. Wen Rui, is a skilled painter of flowers and birds and will also show her skills at the same time. The exhibition is scheduled to be held at the Hushi Society on Guizhou Road for seven days, starting from April 3rd to the 9th. Admission is free, and a very lively event is expected.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Four Seasons Flower Garden at Hongqiao Sanatorium</h3>
<p>The Hongqiao Sanatorium in western Shanghai has recently constructed a four-seasons flower garden at the highest point of the sanatorium. The entire garden is a reddish-brown color and is extremely bright. It uses appropriate temperature control. There are also flowers and plants that bloom in all seasons, as well as an aquarium. All kinds of fish in the world are available. Being in it, the birds sing and the flowers are fragrant, as if in a good spring. Climbing to a high place and looking around, the green fields are beautiful, and the eyes are widened and the mind is pleased. Watching fish and cultivating flowers can cultivate emotions and nourish the mind, which is especially important for patients. This kind of arrangement, in European and American sanatoriums, does everything possible to be wonderful, so that they forget the pain of illness and know the joy of recuperation. It is now set every Sunday morning as the opening time. All sectors are welcome to visit. Mr. Wu Zhihui made a special trip to watch it yesterday, and had lunch in the restaurant for a while. According to the hospital, it is China's specialized hospital for the treatment of heart and lung diseases, the newest type of sanatorium in the East. Dr. Ding Huikang, the dean of the hospital, was ordered by the Ministry of Interior Affairs a few years ago to investigate the facilities for tuberculosis prevention and the situation of sanatoriums in various countries. Since returning to China last spring, he has adopted various specialized machines, promoted pulmonary surgical treatment, X-ray group examinations, China's disease insurance system, the national implementation of tuberculosis prevention implementation regulations, health examinations, etc., which are highly praised by the authorities and all sectors.</p>

<h3>"Going to Jail for a Meal"</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>According to reports, an unemployed man, driven by the pressure of life, stole a wooden table from a certain house and then surrendered himself to the police. Upon questioning, he confessed that he had been unemployed for a long time and could not maintain his livelihood. Therefore, he took this action in the hope that after entering prison, his basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter could be temporarily resolved. As a result, he was sentenced to 50 days of detention as a warning. Seeking a meal through crime can be said to be a whimsical idea. However, the bitterness of his plan is also quite worthy of lamentation.</p>
<p>The suffering of unemployment is indescribable. Pressed by life, the weak wail below the starvation line, and the strong take risks. Most of the criminals in society are forced out by the lack of food, clothing, and shelter. Are they born evil, dare to do wrong, really have no choice, who does not want to be a good citizen? Especially in recent years, economic panic has been widespread, causing groups of unemployed to wander the streets. Foreign countries often have hunger teams to demand bread from the authorities, which is enough to show the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>Therefore, the behavior of this unemployed man is not surprising. He has been unemployed for a long time, unless he does not want to live, he must find a way to maintain his livelihood. But where is the job? This makes him have to do the dirty business of stealing, to enter prison, to solve the immediate food, clothing, and shelter. Although prison life is hard, it is much better than starving and freezing outside. This method is certainly not a long-term plan, but at least in the short term, it will not lead to starvation! If someone asks how to maintain the economy after being released from prison? I can only say that you are too far-sighted.</p>
<p>However, having said that, I am afraid that not many people are willing to go to prison to suffer. If in the future a group of unemployed people, all like him, once in a dead end, then shouted in unison: "Go to jail for a meal!" I think it will be really difficult to cope with at that time.</p>
<h3>A Melancholy Ode: The Lost Dusk</h3>
<p>— Ye Jiayi</p>
<p>Having sent off the desolate sunset sinking in the smoky, turbid West, darkness gradually crept into my heart: The eclipse of light sets off the loneliness of sorrow!</p>
<p>I turned on the dim light in an effort to alleviate my depression; but the faint light shone on the mud-plastered wall worn down by time, and the cramped room seemed even more gloomy!</p>
<p>"What have I done? Life has faded away for another day!"</p>
<p>In the depressed dusk, only a depressed shadow accompanies me. The unbearable assault made me grab--grab tightly onto my disheveled hair, it was like my enemy, and the anger in my heart seemed to be all over it.</p>
<p>"Go away, what does this city have to offer you?--Neon lights, licentious songs, the bitter smiles of flesh, the struggle for life:"</p>
<p>But, one year, two years...I stayed!</p>
<p>Perhaps there are also beautiful dusks, but only one in the past:</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>That should not be forgotten. It was a twilight where the stars twinkled, fireflies danced, and the insects chirped in a gentle breeze; a twilight without the sound of human voices; a quiet, mysterious, beautiful twilight: In that twilight, two youthful shadows embraced under the stars, and two ardent souls intertwined in a harmonious atmosphere. And a girl sang a song called "Dream Love." The sound was like a clear spring, like a celestial dance, it lingered in the small yet vast space, flew into the hearts of sleeping people, and opened up a smile in dreams.</p>
<p>"Won't you forget this dusk?" I said.</p>
<p>"Forever..."</p>
<p>Ah! This all too memorable twilight is now shattered, lost in the sea from which it can never be recovered.</p>
<p>A distant and intoxicating dusk, now draws near in memory, but it is like a snake sucking my heart's blood!</p>
<p>Now the melancholy dusk is even dimmer, fuzzier, and more constricting; crushing my heart into a cinder, which is then kicked by memory into countless small spots, leaving only an empty heart and an unbearable dusk!</p>
<p>Ah! How much I commemorate you! This lost dusk.</p>
<h3>A Gloomy Spring</h3>
<p>Isn't this the third month? Yet the universe has not opened its bright eyes!</p>
<p>Every day, the gradually cold rain gathers into streams on the back of the tiles, dripping down from the pipes into the stagnant gutters, just ringing and ringing, always as monotonous as the pendulum of a clock. Looking up at the gray and sorrowful clouds, listening to the desolate sound of rain, the silence and melancholy are profound!</p>
<p>--This spring of this year...people often clamor so.</p>
<p>The unfinished meaning is full of sorrow.</p>
<p>The stagnant pond, without a green duckweed to adorn the season, the withered lawn, yet has there been a wild yellow flower that has not brought the spring news, the swallows shoot through the low sky, and there are no butterflies in love with the yellow flowers. The child looks up at the blurred day every day for his newly pasted kite, just wanting a corner of the gap to leak a little sunshine, let the sun wake up the spring that should be awake. Finally, finally, his little soul is also disappointed and gloomy!</p>
<p>In melancholy, I dug up a spring that had gone far away:</p>
<p>That was in the suburbs of my remote village, also in this third month, but it had the sentiment of the third month in the countryside: lush wheat fields, wildflowers, bright eyes of the sun, a warm and intoxicating spring breeze, and pastoral songs sent by herdsmen sitting on the backs of cattle. Spring is really spring.</p>
<p>My girl has a pair of eyes like spring water and a face flying with peach colors, the two of us dragged a butterfly-shaped kite together on the field of grass. That was our flesh and blood and souls pasted together.</p>
<p>"Lingzi, this is spring is yours, and also mine; it is of the two of us."</p>
<p>She fell into my arms, picked a yellow flower from the ground and inserted it on my button. She said:</p>
<p>"Hold it, hold it, hold this spring; let us not let it escape."</p>
<p>She laughed brighter than the spring mountains, gentler than the sun.</p>
<p>"Let us tie our two hearts on the string of this kite, blow it to the sky like we have broken away from all the shackles of this world."</p>
<p>At that time, the souls of youth exchanged courageously and happily.</p>
<p>However, however, how short this spring light is: two hearts tied to the line of the kite, unexpectedly were blown off the line by the strong wind and separated, and now, hers is deeply locked in the heavy boudoir!</p>
<p>Every year, when the natural third month of spring is re-reflected into my lost eyes, the sorrow of a wanderer and the heart of pain, look up at the sky of the hometown, how unbearable it should be!</p>
<p>This gloomy spring may be coming soon,...</p>
<h3>A Pleasure Boat on the Calm Lake</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Before the dust from my clothes had been wiped off, I hurriedly hired a pleasure boat. Looking back at Nanping, I wanted to listen to the evening bell, but the boat was already lightly cutting through the water and heading north. At this time, the evening sun suddenly became coquettish, not knowing where it had hidden itself. Under the gray sky, the mountains surrounding the lake were faintly covered with a layer of purple shadows. Looking west at Su Causeway, I could only find a line of green in the misty water. Although it was not raining, it already made people feel that the frowning appearance of West Lake was lovely at this time. For the first time, I recognized the gentleness and comfort of West Lake water with its luster. On such a calm and delicate wave surface, the mountain scenery, willow colors, red pavilions, and bridge banks were reflected so hazy and charming. Even the light and weightless pleasure boat seemed unable to bear it. It really made people unwilling to paddle, let alone cut through this delicate and quiet water surface.</p>
<p>The boat passed through Broken Bridge and entered the inner lake. A boat carrying three or four nuns with bright eyes and kind smiles passed by. The boatman told us that today is the eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, and they have come to the lake to release lives and chant sutras. When the boat going forward had passed the Broken Bridge, the faint sounds of chanting sutras and wooden fish could be heard across the bridge over the water.</p>
<p>In front of Fanghe Pavilion, the boat was tied under a willow tree. There I saw the tomb of Feng Xiaoqing, a mound of earth in the shape of a steamed bun, burying her life of sorrow and beauty. From Fanghe Pavilion, I went up and walked into a tomb door erected with stone pillars. Under the green leaves of the plum blossoms, I visited the tomb of Lin Hejing and the Crane Tomb. I felt that the hermit had this ending, which was indeed worthwhile. Now, although the crane no longer returns, the plum blossoms still bloom every year, and there is also the discerning and refined Xiaoqing to accompany him. Hejing, if he knows, will naturally smile. The mourning and envy of tourists like us ordinary people in the floating world is nothing more than self-styled lofty or clever vulgarity.</p>
<p>Because I had an appointment with a friend at six o'clock, the two hours of lake tour were too precious. After walking a little on the mountain, I did not have time to leisurely enjoy the tranquility of the forest. I hurriedly untied the boat and went west. The scenery of the inner lake has its own interesting places. Although the lake is narrow, it has high mountains and deep forests. Buildings and villas are densely packed here. I prefer the tranquility here, unlike the noisy and bustling Xinshichang area. I also took the opportunity to row the boat to the front of the Huizhong Hotel, went in to see the house, and agreed to move over tomorrow morning. My companions seemed to dislike the lack of excitement, but I couldn't care so much. When passing Xiling Bridge, I did not visit the small tomb, and felt very guilty. She was indeed a prostitute, but as long as she was pure and clean at heart, even being a prostitute would not detract from her personality, which is far superior to ordinary deceivers. The boat then turned east from here and headed towards Pinghu Qiuyue (Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake). Pinghu Qiuyue is one of the ten scenic spots. The pavilion and buildings are not very impressive, and it is not a moonlit night, so I can't see its merits at all. Opposite it are the mountains of Nanping. If you can sit quietly by the lake in the quiet morning or night with a cup of green tea, and hear the bell tower sound across the water, there must be a kind of ethereal tranquility. But the boatman said that the big bell has now been moved to Fenglin Temple in the inner lake.</p>
<p>The boat was originally parked on the right side of Luoyuan. At first, I didn't know that Luoyuan, a few white houses, had been used as an art college. Coming out of Pinghu Qiuyue, I turned around and saw the open iron fence, with its vermilion eaves and red pillars, which was very beautiful, so I rushed in indiscriminately, causing the doorman wearing a cap to rush in to ask who I was visiting.</p>
<p>The boat left Luoyuan and cut towards the center of the lake again. There was already some twilight on the lake, and I was surprised to realize that the two hours had passed so quickly compared to the time on the train just now. The number of boats was also gradually decreasing. Suddenly, another faint sound of chanting sutras and wooden fish came, scattered on the lake with the slight waves. When I turned around to look for it, I only saw a vast expanse of the calm lake, and the place where the sound came from was nowhere to be found.</p>
