<p>（七）山西的國防經濟建設　省政十年建設計劃</p>
<p>山西這幾年來的，一切經濟建設（也可以說是一切建設。）的最後作用，似乎可以用“自强”兩個字去包括。所以，當牠編定“省政十年建設計劃”的時候，也特別檫明了牠的動機，是：“在於了未來的國難，在於自强。”這個建設計劃內容涉及的範圍，是非常之大；其規模實在就是總動員的變態。記者在山西時，對於牠各部門建設活動的情形，曾仔細地加以考察，而得訓的印象呢，却是無論任何部份，都有一種共同的精神，在充溢著。這所謂共同精神，其實就是向著總動員目標邁進的奮鬥。山西的今日，雖沒有達到總動員的地步，然而，那一種至少可說是非常時的現象，却在這裏那裏地呈現著。這個“十年建設計劃，”是二十一年年底編成的。五年以來，牠策動了山西非常時的行動，使牠的一切建設，（尤其是經濟建設。（都一律帶上了濃厚的國防色調。　　　　對於這麼一個龐大的，作爲山西這十年內一切建設凖則的，所謂“省政十年建設計劃，”我覺得，比牠所有的具體沽動，還要值得我們的注意。我在山西的時候，曾多方設法搜集和訪問，現在，把我所得的歸納起來，被露在下面</p>
<p>（甲）產生這個計劃的動機。十九年中原大戰後閻百川先生離開山西。一直到“九一八”事變後，二十年年底，四屆一中全會開會的時候，他才正式對國防表示了意見，提出“請政府檢拔十萬勁旅死守錦州以救危亡”，和“請政冷及時確定十年自强計劃”，這兩個議案。二十一年春天，閻氏就晋，綏的綏靖主任，這時，他又正式負起晋，綏兩省的國防重貞了。當時的山西情勢，一方面，是地方局面的暫時平爲；而另一面，則又是國防前衛責任的加重。這麼著，使山西的當局們，不得不作長遠的打算、他們確認當時及未來國難的嚴重；可是，他們以為，現在的國難，是由於過去的當國者沒有整個建國計劃，和未能盡建國的責任所致；而要解除這嚴重的國難呢，也不是一句空話所能奏效，必須有通盤的計劃，和竭力的實行。要是用山西當局的說法，就是：“了現在的國難，在抵抗；了未來的國難；在自强。”以為如果沒有確實的自强計劃去實行，那末，不獨目前國離抵抗不了，而且，還會把牠“移植到將來去的。”所以，在國家沒有整個辦法以前，他們就不得不先替山西一省訂一個“省政十年建設計劃。”概括設來，這計劃產生的動機，就是如此。不過詳細地說來，當時他們的意覓，對於山西的積弱，一共又細分成四點：㊀“從政者心理不良，”使政治亦隨之窩敗。㊁“人民的無組織，無能力，因而等於無人”，“可能動作；所謂“國民總動員”的事，也就無從談起㈢“工陶淍敝，”“而農民尤有民不聊生的情勢。”所以，在民力上，就呈出了“貧•弱•愚•私•”的四種現象•㊃“關稅旣不能保護坐彥，”而大宗實業官家因“待財政充實，或外資借入”故一時不舉辦；“私人旣苦無資，又患無利，甚至虧倒，誰肯輕易冒險！”於是“生彥就永遠落後”了。山西的當局們，把山西的積弱分成上列的四點以後，接着，針對着這四方面就打算定出四種計劃；卽是所謂：“改善現行政治之計劃，”“籌備地方自治計劃，”“人民生產計劃，”以及“公營事業計劃。”把這四種合成一體，就是成爲“省政十年建設計劃”的胚胎。所謂“省政十年建設計劃”產生的動機，就是這樣•不過。還應當加上一句的，就是：他們所謂的四種計劃裏，後二者是主體，前二者是輔助；換句話說，“省政十年建設計劃”的唯一重心，還是在於國防經濟建設這一點。再引用一遍閻百川先生的話就是；“造產救國。”</p>
<p>（乙）產生的經過嚴格地說，這個龐大計劃的產生，第一個階段，應當說是“九一八”事變後，山西特殊情勢的醖釀，因而，引起山西人士們相當一致的思考。其次的一個階段，就是彼此意見的交換和討論，在某些點上，得着了大概一致的結論。等到正式從事編定的時候，那已經算是第三個階段了。現在，祇就正式從事編定後的產生經過，略述一述。</p>
<p>二十一年春天，閻百川先生正式提出了編定“十年建設計劃的意思。不久，就以山西省政府名義，召開一個‘山西省政設計姿負會，並且請閻百川先生爲會長，負召集的責任。’又不久，就由閻召集軍政各界人員，議定了期限，設計原則和網領。這是第段工作。網領等議定後，就派定了許多有專門學識，或辦事經騐的委員，把綱領等交給他們去根據設計。這些委員裏，又委定邱仰𤀹（現任民政廳長）和樊象離（現任建設廳長）二氏做主任。前者主持政治部份的起草，後者主持經濟部份的起草。這是第一次草案，算是第二段工作。這時，閻氏又添派有學識有經騐者多人，組織第一第二兩審查委員會。派李慶芳氏爲第一審主任，陸近禮氏爲第一審主任。將上述第一次草案，交兩會同時審查，並限期竣事。這是第三段工作。所有這三段工作，可謂爲集思廣益時期。閻氏將各種意見滙集之後，於是，派編輯多人，從事編輯。其時、閻氏忽因其封翁病重，不得不滯留河邊村私邸，編輯進行，不得不暫時停頓。繼而爲積極進行起見，由閻氏電令編輯四人携各案到河邊村，就近向閻氏逐口述，以便其逐案明瞭，作最後决定。這時，除以上述各案意見為主，酌量採取外，閻氏又將以前在綏署和軍政各界共同研究的“廉潔政治及有效工作辦法，”一併挼入，擬定了一個“山西省政十年建設大綱。依這大綱，又擬定“縣村建設計劃之榜樣及指針，”亦加入其中。除此而外，閻氏又想到種種推行上的實際問題，於是，本著這些問題（共有九個。）的意旨，又把原來所擬的，加以增訂。一直到這時，“山西省政十年建設計劃集，”才算正式定了出夾。最後，爲愼車起見，又出閻召集軍政各界人員，反覆討論後，始作爲定奪。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>不賣買私貨運動感言</h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>昨日本市各界。在布商會開不賣買私貨運動宣傳大會。到者十分踴躍。宣傳十分熱烈。此種不賣買私貨運動在今日確有必要。但是推究其故實可痛心。放釋其義。以告國人。</p>
<p>本國人用本國貨。是現代愛國人民所應遵守之原則。無論劣貨私貨。不應賣賀。卽凡舶來的品物。非不得已。實亦不應賣買。現在劣貨私貨。充塞市塲。舉目皆是。國貨所受打擊。異常深烈。凡我國人。茍稍有一些愛國心。一些自覺心。對於此種現𧰼。能不惕然。</p>
<p>國人當知東北同胞正在水深火熱之中。身受痛苦。無法自㧞。而華北事𧰼猶多觸目驚心者。在此種情勢之下。國貨已難積極發展。如再任令私貨汎濫全國。則亡國之禍可立而待然。一般奸商惟利是圖。而不顧國家存亡。無論道德上之制裁。不生效力。卽明定法典刑章。亦恐有所不顧。此不賣運動與不買運動所由必須同時並進也。</p>
<p>吾以為我國人之愛國心。未必薄弱。凡有血氣。俱有天良平日隱伏於中。無從表見。一經激發則良心上之火焰。自易燃燒。此次不賣買私貨運動宣傳大會以後。深盼賣買私貨者。各憑着自己良心。毅然决然戒除此種貽害國家之罪惡。</p>
<p>鄰邦人士常謂我國人素以五分鐘熱度著稱。愛國之心。往往不能維持永久時至今日國人能否免此譏誚當於此次大會之後果覘之矣。</p>

<h3>日本第一財閥三井的政治經濟勢力</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>（一）引言</p>
<p>今日的世界，有六分之五的面積，是被金融資本統制着。日本是六分之五中的一部份。日本的金融資本家，最大的是三井，他的資本估日本全財富的百分之二十五，無論在政治方面經濟方面，都有着極大的支配作用。解剖三井發展的全過程，這對於理解日本，日很有帮助的。而且，中日的關係，在目前是太特殊了，中國失去了廣大的土地，中國的民衆，正感受着重大的威脅與壓迫：這威脅與壓迫，便是世界資本主義——尤其是日本，贈予中國的禮物。代表資本主義的利益的、在任何國裏都只是少數人，勤勞大衆及一般小資產層，原也是和殖民地或半殖民地的大衆樣，忍受着生的煎熬和生的苦痛，這現象，日本也當不能例外。</p>
<p>日本的大衆生活，較前苦多了。日本的社會的矛盾，也較前深刻多了。統制日本的金融資本家，爲求避免目前的危機，自然要擴大殖民地。——擴充殖民地，這與我國的關係是多麼密切。在國內刋物中，研究日本財閥的文字現在還很少，把日本最大金融資本家的發展和動向，介紹於國人，這在筆者認爲是很必要的。</p>
<p>（二）三井姓氏的來源</p>
<p>把握着日本資本界的中樞神經的井家，在一六三三年時，還只是一個釀酒製醬油的商店。講到三井家的歷史是很有趣味的，他家本姓藤原，在九百多年前，隷屬武士階級，在近江一帶有很大的莊園和權力。後來不知為了甚麼，捨棄了都市生活，移居到一個叫做“三井”的村落裏。同時也捨棄了藤原的姓，從定住地改姓三井。這三井，便是今日有總資本額五十五億一千數百萬元，橫縱日本的金融界，產業界，同時更强力的支配着日本政治的井財閥了。</p>
<p>說起現在的日本閱閥來，誰也知道貴族院議長近衛文麿家是最高的門第。但近衛公自己就使用着一個“藤原文麿”的印章，“九•一八”事變後，三井更捐巨欵建了一個紀念近衛公亡父的會館。這樣一來，是近衛公的家系和三井的家系，都是同出“藤原”了。這些貴族和財閥的家系，我們原無推究之必要，不過山此種事實，也可看出三井的勢力及日本資本主義的封建性。</p>
<p>但，所謂三井家的歷史，是從一六三三年才開始的。那便是他家從武士階級受到排擠，做為一個商人的時候。三井之能逃出武士階級的沒落命運，以一個新興資產階級的姿態出現，這事情是很關重要的。</p>
<p>（三）三井的發展</p>
<p>距今三百零四年前，三井家是釀酒和製造醬油的。二白六十五年前，三井家纔到東京開設了一個叫做越後屋的吳服（日本服）綢緞舖。現在在日本生活的人誰也知道有個富麗堂皇馳名世界的三越百貨公司，這三越公司就是出越後屋發展下來的，而且也是三井王國在東京的最初的商業基礎。</p>
<p>開設吳服店後，三井家接着又成立了兩個錢莊。這錢莊，也卽便是今日三井銀行的前身。</p>
<p>明治維新是日本踏上近代資本主義的第一步。這維親事是由三井家的財刀支持成功的。表面上說來是忠君勤王，其實却是新興資產階級反封建的表現。明治維新，同時也就是三井維新，這維新是三井財閥發展的一個重要關鍵。</p>
<p>因爲三井曾經積極的支持過新政府，所以從明治改元起，政府的一切政策——特別是財政策，大半是取决於三井的意向。同時，執行政實的責任者，又多是三井的部下。在明治政府中，三井財閥的絕大政治支配力，是不能否認的。</p>
<p>財閥三井的發展過程，也和一般資本家相同，那便是山商業資本而工業資本，更由工業資本發展到金融資木獨估的階段。要說三井工業，首先不能不說到三池炭山。三池炭山原來是日本國有的，但在明治初年時，被三井以四百五十萬元的代價買爲已有了。買到手後，大加整頓，沒有幾年，不只是把四百五十萬元的買價賺了回來，而且還得了很多的利益。現在三池炭山的出炭量，每年爲三白萬噸，以一噸十元計算，每年的收入已是三千萬元了。</p>
<p>此後三井又陸續收買了許多炭山，從南方的五洲一直到北海道，沿途都可看見三井的炭山，無怪乎日本人要說：“三井之富從石炭”了</p>
<p>三井的炭山共有七個，每年產炭八百二十三萬三千九百八十噸。全日本每年的產炭量，據最近的調査，是三干二百五十二萬三千餘噸•那麼三井炭山的產量，是佔日本全炭產量的十分之一已二•五了。</p>
<p>除了炭山外，三井還有金銀銅錫的礦山。這些礦山所支配的公司共有二十多個。此外做爲石炭業的附帶事業的，更有染料工業和化學工業等。如三池染料工業所（製造肥料，工業藥品，火藥，染料，化學兵器……等）及三池製鍊所（製造亞鉛，硫酸……等）便是。</p>
<p>促進三井的發展的，有三件最重大的事：第一是中日戰事，第二是日俄戰爭，第三是世界大戰。中日戰爭期間，日本國內軍需工業景氣了，這給予初興的三井工業以莫大的利益。中日戰爭後，日本奪取了東亞的最大車塲，三井的資本網，就大大的伸張到中國和臺灣方面了。從中國取得豐富的原料，從這些原料製造商品，然後冉把這些商品輸出國外去，從此三井的物產公司（一八七六年創辦，資本原爲五萬元，現已增加爲一億元。）大大發展了，三井的商品大量的輸入中國，同時也輸入歐美了。這也就是說，新興的日本資本主義，從此在世界資本主義的鎖鍊中，成爲重要的一環了。寫到這裏，筆者不禁悲從中來，只因爲中國的政治腐敗，以致把中國淪入半殖民地的悲慘狀况裏，做了日本資本主義發展的墊脚石。三井財閥的發展，便是日本資本主義發展的縮影，這財閥的發展，每次都和進攻中國有密切的和關係。</p>
<p>中日戰爭後是日戰爭，日俄戰爭的結果，確定了日本在中國東北的勢力。東北的一切特產，從此便大部份被三井經營着，東北物產傾銷於世界市塲，三井的勢力，也就在世界市塲中，取得更進一步的重要地位了。</p>
<p>世界大戰，令日本的資本主義定上最高峯，三井的資本蓄積，也由此發展到金融資本獨佔的階段。這只要看三井銀行的資本的蓄積，就可以明白。</p>
<p>三井銀行，三井信託，三井生命保險，是井財閥金融資本中的最重要部門。三井銀行的資金，在一九一四年（歐戰開始時），還只是二千萬元，到一九一九年便已發展到六千萬元了。這數字，一直繼續到現在。儲欵的數字，近已較一九一九年增加三億三千六百五十一萬餘元。此外，三井信託和三井生命保險的資金，也在飛躍的增進着。這在說明甚麼呢？這說明了三井財閥的資本獨佔性，說明了日本歐內農村之必然破產及勞動階級之必然成熟和强大，同時更說明了走上帝國主義階段後的日本國內的危險：於是“九•一八”事變發生了。這事變，强化了日本的統制階級，暫時，麻醉了一般在生活難下掙扎着的小市民，緩了勞動階級的鬥爭情緒。</p>

<h3>婦女團體要求參加制憲宣言</h3>
<p>本市各婦女團體、為要求參加制憲、昨聯合發表宣言、略云、全國男女同胞們在目前的中國召集國民大會、制定國家憲法、誠如三中全會宣言所示實在“救亡圖存”的偉大工作之一、為了加强“救亡圖存”的力量起見、不能不有一部良好的根本大法、眞能代表全體民意的憲法、來確定人民的根本利權與義務、使人民與政府的相互關係、使人民有充分的“權”、政府有充分的“能”、同心協力、從事於“建國之大業”、所以制憲在目前的中國、的確是具有非常重大意義的工作、參加國民大會的制憲、無疑的是中華民國全體國民所應有的權利與義務、固然佔國民半數的婦女、在條文上本有參加制憲的權利、可是眼前的事實、吿訴我們、因為一般婦女的社會地位低落、與敎育機會的受限制、在國民代表的選舉上、無法與男同胞競爭、以致在初選中、只有極少數的地方、和極少數的婦女、當選為候選人、複選時她們能否當選、尚屬疑問、因此、我們婦女在實際上、無異被排斥於國民大會的門戶之外、結果、將只有遵守憲法的義務、而無參加制憲的權利、這决不止影響婦女本身的利益、同時也必然要影響於整個民族和國家的利益、我們婦女、為了行使國民應有的權利、履行國民應盡的義務、同時也就是為了挽救國家的危亡、復興民族的光榮、不能不要求與男國民一樣、參加國民大會制憲的神聖工作、如果佔國民半數的婦女、實際上不能有適當人數的代表、參加國民大會、結果、就會有半數國民的利益、不能得有充分的保障、同時也就有半數國民的力量、不能充分的發揚、而最最不幸的是中華民國第一次的國民大會、不能成為名符其實的全體國民所共有的大會、這將是一個多麼可驚的不幸的結果啊、我們不僅為了本身利益、同時為了整個國家整個民族的利益、義不容辭地要爭取我們應有的國民權利與義務、我們淸楚地認定、惟有我們婦女自己、才眞能瞭解除我們自身的痛苦、而且也惟有依賴我們自身的力量、才可以解除我們自身的痛苦、所以我們惟有能夠實際參加制憲的工作、我們婦女在憲法上的權利、才有可以信賴的保證、我們婦女在憲法上的義務、才有可以遵守的價值、而且我們也惟有緊密地聯台起來、堅强的表現出我們半數國民的意志和力量、我們才能爭得眞正的光榮的勝利、我們婦女參加制憲運動乃是拯救國家復興民族的偉大運動之一、所以我們誠懇地希望全國的男同胞們贊助我們這個運動、同時我門熱烈地希望全國的女同胞們、立刻聯合起來、迅速地廣泛地開展我們這個運動、要我們把定决心、一致努力我們的前途、一定有光明燦爛的前程、上海市婦女會等、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>良心和决心</h3>
<p>— 沈倩</p>
<p>看到日輪車平丸上我國水手四人，“月擊該船走私一年有餘，為義憤所激，於該船駛至秦皇島附近中國領海時，乘機將押運私貨之某方人監視，臨時將該船改向烟臺開駛，於二十二日駛抵烟臺，當由烟毫東海關將私貨全部沒收的新聞時，（見昨日本報濟南通信），我想是無不人心大快，也無不對這四位義勇的英雄，表示至高的敬意的。從這帶有戲劇意味的英雄舉動中，我們不但證明平素為士大夫們所瞧不起的販夫走卒之流的水手“愛國不敢後人”，並且他們的愛國之心還超過患得患失的士大夫們，他們一且激於義憤，不但不爲自己的職業打算，並且還不顧性命，敢四個人微小的力量來和走私的浪人對壘！這義舉，不但是這四位義勇的英雄的光榮，更且也是全中國海員的光榮！</p>
<p>現在，由於這義勇的舉動，日方已經有一艘兵艦駛到烟臺示威了，並且還蠻橫的“索此中國水手”，看樣子，大概又將來一套故作張皇，冀將事態擴火的把戲了吧？如果正是這樣，那麼，除了凖備了爲保衛民族和正義血流血的决心，靜以待變之外，實在也决無第二項辦法。</p>
<p>恰好在這條新聞和讀者相見的同日，上海市各界不買賣私貨運動會在舉行一個擴大宣傳會。爲了使人明瞭走私的毒害，擴大宣傳，原是很重要的。不過這次擴大宣傳，實際上却不够“大”，地點祗限於市商會大禮堂，那不僅容積太小，而且限於工作時間等等，一般的市民怕也不能出席參加，何祝在較冷僻的工人區域間，因為不識字和不看報的關係，恐怕就連這會事都不知道。</p>
<p>因之不由人想起用最通俗和最接近民衆的敎育工具，如說書小調等來喚起民衆，灌輸不買賣私貨不做漢奸的思想的方法來，據昨日出版的本報每週增刊“太原通信”告訴我們，太原現在正在厲行“救亡書詞運動”，而且成績很好，起先意存觀望的，現在也紛紛要求加入來學習了，“就在日常說唱的時候，觀衆點他們的戲點得頂多的，還是救亡書詞。”這在上海也很不乏先例。譬如“活捉XX人”，在上海的各遊戲塲裏，不是就會風行一時過嗎？而據其他雜誌如“光明”如“戲劇時代”的太原通訊告訴我們，在太原，不但是“書詞”是擔負起了救亡的責任，就是其他遊藝，也莫不用了新的內容，來參加救亡的工作的。</p>
<p>同樣，我們如果利用這些最通俗的接近民衆的藝術，來喚起民衆不買賣私貨，不做漢奸，他的成效也一定會極大的。</p>
<p>自然這還祇做到求我們的“良心”所安，這還祇是喚起同胞的“良心”的工作，而在敵人的武力的文化的以及政治經濟的侵略下，單靠“良心”，實在也不够防術我們的被侵害；就如走私，便有無恥浪人的武力護衛和內奸的改頭換面，以致本來不願買賣私貨的，因爲經過了改裝的手續，就難以看出它的眞面目，結果還是上當。何况軟詐之外，還有硬欺，像東平丸事件，隨後而來者，便是兵艦！</p>
<p>因之，單單靠着“良心”，就顯得不够，繼“良心”之後，我們還敢有血的“決心”！這决心並且不單該是幾個人有，更且是該全民一致的有的。</p>
<p>而喚起人人的“良心”和“决心”，則眞正的擴大宣傳，應該是急不及待的。</p>
<h3>項明</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>我認識項明是當我還不大懂事的時侯，我正跟著叔叔住在河南省的一個大城市裏，那時北伐軍剛剛打到那兒不久，叔叔便是隨軍隊來的。</p>
<p>我們住在一道，白天我去讀書，晚上回來，每逢到家，家裏總有很多人，全穿灰衣服：是叔叔的同事們。</p>
<p>那時候雖然明明地禁止打牌，他們晚上除非值日不能不去上班以外，每晚總要來八圈。</p>
<p>不知道怎麼的，我從小孩子的時候就討厭打牌，無論是什麼牌，哪種賭，我都討厭。他們在那裏嘩啦嘩啦地洗牌，或者筒呵萬的呌起來的時候我總非常難過，頭痛，書不能讀，就氣得呆坐在院子裏。叔叔雖然知道我這個壞脾氣，為了他底那些朋友總不能不打，或者到別的地方去打，有時候！他還吵我：“孩子不大，脾氣可不小！”</p>
<p>有一天，來了一位叔叔的同事，他很年輕，個子很高，有一張山東人的大臉，嚮亮的喉嚨，比我們體育敎員的還強。他很怪，跟我一樣不喜歡打牌。</p>
<p>他就是項明。</p>
<p>那一天，大家夥又凑起手來了，就嘩啦嘩啦的洗起牌來，只有項明不參加，甚至連他一看也不看，就跑過來看我演算術。</p>
<p>他剛一站在我身後，那邊的人就吵了：</p>
<p>“老二，來呵，！”</p>
<p>“我討厭打脾！”</p>
<p>“好家伙，”一個人說，“你聽他說的還怪好聽哩！你可知道，不服從多數就是反動份子，就是軍閥走狗，就是帝國……”</p>
<p>“別說啦！”項明轉過身去，向著那够嘻嘻哈哈笑着的人說，你們就背會了幾個名字。可是，……你們打麻將呌司令部查着，……”</p>
<p>聽着他說了很多話，又是什麼“革命”“群衆”“青年”“精神，”我全不懂。不過，他反對打麻將的意思我是懂得的</p>
<p>我很高興地跟他談，他帮助我畫算式，還會講很多有趣的故事。他是一個有趣的，快樂的人物。到後來，我才知道他是一個被稱為革命模範人物的，他勇敢，熱情，從年青時就在軍閥的逮捕下生活，直到北伐軍到了，他才公開地活動。</p>
<p>然而叔叔們談到他的時候總設：</p>
<p>“太年輕了，孩子氣還沒脫…”</p>
<p>我倒不管他孩子氣老人氣，只要跟我談得來，我就跟他在一起。所以，我就跟他成了要好的朋友。他時常來，有時買很多東西來。然而，有一天，聽說他被調走了，我見不到他，寂寞得很。一直寂寞到現在。我時常紀念起他來。</p>
<p>今年冬年，我從北平回家，在車站上碰到他，他好像跑了幾年跑縮縮了，個子顯得很短，裹在皮大衣裏，聲音在北風裏有些發抖，一點也不洪亮了。</p>
<p>一見面，我高興得很，握緊他的手，說不出話來，最後才想起他的脾氣：</p>
<p>“你現在打不打牌？”</p>
<p>“不用說那了，”他用北平話說：“什麼都幹，吃，喝，嫖，賭，吹，樣樣都幹！”</p>
<p>我望望他的臉，那是蒼白色的。</p>
<p>“你的個子長高了，現在大學讀得怎麼樣了？”我告訴他還有一個學期，就結束，“你們年青人有希望，有希望，去年我在報上看到幹教國的有你，……”說着，看看錶：“我要走了，車就聞</p>
<p>“到那裏去呢？”</p>
<p>他揚了揚手，沒有說話走了。我呆呆地望着他，不知道說什麼好。</p>

<h3>刀豆</h3>
<p>— 吳贊房</p>
<p>彎桃上市的時節，我們的飯菜上又新添出一碗刀豆來了。因為牠的形式像把刀，所以一般人都稱牠做刀豆。但是我們的鄉下，却是叫牠四月結，原因牠是陰歷四月時候結實的。如果對我們鄉里人也稱刀豆，那是誰也不會知道的。</p>
<p>我的鄉下人家，差不多每家都有一個菜園子。吃的菜疏，就是從自己的菜園里種出來的。不像城市人樣樣菜疏都要買，而且又不新鮮。我眼看着桌上這碗刀豆，就要想起家鄉菜園里瓜棚豆架下的四月結來了。</p>
<p>那是多麼快樂的記憶啊！小鳥一般，跟在母親身前向後，或者替母親提一隻小藍子，跳啊蹤的到菜園里去摘新鮮菜疏。黃瓜啊—紅莧啊—依秩序，揀大的搞了去。等到我們走過豆架底下，驚奇的是看見新生出來的四月結了。是那麼綠嫩的，偶一不留心，就會被長指甲碰破一些白槳出來。母親告訴我，嫩四月結炒肉片，是最好吃的蔬菜。這一句話差不多把我的饞涎也賺了出來，但我終於沒有把牠滴下來，仍舊是暗暗咕咚着吞下肚去。當摘滿一筐的時候，母親就吩咐我快點上學去，停會午飯時來吃新燒的蔬菜。</p>
<p>放了午學回家，就急急的跳嚷進門，果然桌上已有一碗熱氣騰騰的鮮四月結炒肉片了。母親笑着把竹筷敲着碗沿說：“來，快來嘗個時新啊！吃了好用心讀書”。我就在母親鼓勵和茲歡之下，比平常多吃半碗飯。也許是那時新的四月結引起我的食慾增多吧！</p>
<p>之後，就很快的把我那種黃金甜夢撕毀了，現在祇剩着一個空虛的痕跡。當我夾着一筷刀豆進嘴的時候，就會把遠遠的童年記憶重溫一變。但是那是如何的渺茫飄遠啊！我將從何處去尋回童年時的一顆沙粒呢？我祇有眼望着那碗刀豆浸入默思的境界。</p>
<h3>夏日小品</h3>
<p>— 林加</p>
<p>一，午睡</p>
<p>在夏天，我們的感覺是愉快的，興奮中微微有點麻醉，那輕微的薰風迎面吹來，吹拂着陣陣花草的清香，田野间各种野花，争艷的都塗上了美麗的顏色，太陽光射進水里，翻着燦爛的金光，令人想入非非，偶爾一片白雲，變幻着從青空疾速畫過，地上也留下一條脫轡野馬似的影子馳騁逃去，</p>
<p>中午時候，千萬別錯過了午睡的機會，一個人幽靜的把涼床移在清風徐來的綠楊堤畔，樹梢有斷續的蟬鳴，脚，下嚮着潺緩的水流，身旁放一把蒲扇底一卷詞選，低吟到不知不覺中皆然睡去</p>
<p>午睡的時間本來不能太長，但若睡得正甜蜜的時候，忽被人喚醒，或為雨驚起，那種軟綿綿睡意未足的意味，恰似曲弦樂奏到緊促的當兒，陡然中斷，茲聲雖止，餘音猶存，極盡悱惻之致，</p>
<p>二，雨</p>
<p>夏天的雨，不像黄梅時節或秋霖瀟瀟容易引起人的愁緒，春秋時節欣賞雨景，最好打開窗子或披上雨衣慢慢地踱到郊外原野里去，雨是那麽均匀的落下來。那麽冲淡的富於詩意，</p>
<p>夏天不能這麽欣賞，夏雨是急的，每每天空晴朗得和海水一般，突的湧上一層濃雲，隆隆幾個沉雷，豆粒大的雨點，繩粗的雨綫，便教人不及躱避的貨盆飛下，這時你把窗緊閉上，聽那雨點打着瓦上的沙沙聲，和簷水落地的“堤塔”，像狂濤般奔騰而來。然而一會兒雨過天晴，火樣的太陽仍耀眼的普射着大地。</p>
<p>有人説春天是一個深閨的少女，那麽夏天倒像個熱情的新婦，少女有時是有説不出的哀怨的，而新婦却正是驕傲嫵媚。</p>

<h3>National Defense Line (40)</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent, Uncle Di</p>
<p>(7) Shanxi's National Defense Economic Construction: A Ten-Year Provincial Government Construction Plan</p>
<p>In recent years, all economic construction in Shanxi (it can also be said all construction) seems to be ultimately encompassed by the two words "self-strengthening." Therefore, when drafting the "Ten-Year Provincial Government Construction Plan," it specifically clarified its motive: "To prepare for future national disasters, to focus on self-strengthening." The scope of this construction plan is very large; its scale is essentially a transformed total mobilization. When the reporter was in Shanxi, he carefully investigated the construction activities of its various departments and was deeply impressed by the common spirit permeating every part. This so-called common spirit is, in fact, the struggle to move towards the goal of total mobilization. Although Shanxi has not yet reached the point of total mobilization today, at least a wartime-like phenomenon is appearing here and there. This "Ten-Year Construction Plan" was compiled at the end of the twenty-first year (1932). For five years, it has driven Shanxi's wartime actions, imbuing all its construction (especially economic construction) with a strong national defense flavor. I feel that this vast "Ten-Year Provincial Government Construction Plan," which serves as the guideline for all construction in Shanxi over the next ten years, is even more worthy of our attention than all its specific activities. During my time in Shanxi, I tried every means to collect information and conduct interviews. Now, I have summarized what I have obtained and will reveal it below.</p>
<p>(A) The Motivation for Producing This Plan. After the Central Plains War in the nineteenth year (1930), Mr. Yan Xishan left Shanxi. It was not until after the "September 18th Incident" in the twentieth year (1931) that he formally expressed his opinions on national defense at the First Plenary Session of the Fourth National Congress, proposing "requesting the government to select 100,000 elite troops to defend Jinzhou to save the critical situation" and "requesting the government to promptly determine a ten-year self-strengthening plan." In the spring of the twenty-first year (1932), Mr. Yan assumed the position of Pacification Director of Shanxi and Suiyuan. At this time, he formally took on the heavy responsibility of national defense for the two provinces of Shanxi and Suiyuan. The situation in Shanxi at that time was characterized by the temporary stability of the local situation on the one hand, and the increased responsibility of being at the forefront of national defense on the other. This forced the authorities in Shanxi to make long-term plans. They recognized the severity of the national crisis at that time and in the future; however, they believed that the current national crisis was due to the lack of a comprehensive national construction plan by past leaders and the failure to fulfill the responsibility of national construction. To resolve this serious national crisis, empty words would not suffice. There had to be a comprehensive plan and a determined implementation. In the words of the Shanxi authorities: "To resolve the current national crisis, resist; to resolve future national disasters, self-strengthen." They believed that without a concrete self-strengthening plan to implement, not only would the current national crisis not be resisted, but it would also be "transferred to the future." Therefore, before the nation had a comprehensive plan, they had to first create a "Ten-Year Provincial Government Construction Plan" for Shanxi Province. In summary, the motivation for producing this plan was as such. However, in more detail, their thinking at the time divided Shanxi's long-term weakness into four points: ㊀ "The poor mentality of those in government" led to the corruption of politics. ㊁ "The lack of organization and ability of the people," which was "equivalent to having no one," made "possible action" impossible; the so-called "national mobilization" was out of the question. ㈢ "Industry was declining," and "the peasants were particularly suffering." Therefore, the people's strength showed four characteristics: "poverty, weakness, ignorance, and selfishness." ㊃ "Tariffs could not protect local industries," and large-scale state-owned enterprises were not established because of waiting for "fiscal enrichment or foreign investment." "Private individuals suffered from a lack of capital and feared unprofitability, even losses, so who would dare to take risks lightly!" As a result, "production would forever lag behind." After the Shanxi authorities divided Shanxi's long-term weakness into the above four points, they planned to create four types of plans aimed at these four aspects: namely, "a plan to improve current politics," "a plan to prepare for local autonomy," "a people's production plan," and "a public enterprise plan." Combining these four into one would become the embryo of the "Ten-Year Provincial Government Construction Plan." That is how the "Ten-Year Provincial Government Construction Plan" was motivated. However, it should also be added that, of their so-called four plans, the latter two were the main body, and the former two were auxiliary. In other words, the only focus of the "Ten-Year Provincial Government Construction Plan" was on national defense economic construction. To quote Mr. Yan Xishan again: "Create production to save the country."</p>
<p>(B) The Process of Creation. Strictly speaking, the creation of this vast plan should be divided into three stages. The first stage should be the brewing of Shanxi's special situation after the "September 18th Incident," which aroused a relatively unified thinking among the people of Shanxi. The second stage was the exchange and discussion of opinions with each other, which resulted in roughly consistent conclusions on certain points. By the time it was formally engaged in the compilation, it was already the third stage. Now, I will briefly describe the process of creation after it was formally engaged in the compilation.</p>
<p>In the spring of the twenty-first year (1932), Mr. Yan Xishan formally proposed the idea of compiling a "Ten-Year Construction Plan." Soon, the Shanxi Provincial Government convened a "Shanxi Provincial Government Design Consultation Meeting," and invited Mr. Yan Xishan to be the chairman, responsible for convening it. Soon after, Yan convened personnel from the military, political, and other fields to discuss the deadline, design principles, and outline. This was the first stage of work. After the outline and other matters were agreed upon, many committee members with specialized knowledge or practical experience were appointed to design according to the outline. Among these committee members, Qiu Yangjun (the current Director of Civil Affairs) and Fan Xiangli (the current Director of Construction) were appointed as directors. The former presided over the drafting of the political part, and the latter presided over the drafting of the economic part. This was the first draft, which was considered the second stage of work. At this time, Mr. Yan added many more people with knowledge and experience to form the first and second review committees. Li Qingfang was appointed as the director of the first review committee, and Lu Jinli was appointed as the director of the second review committee. The first draft was submitted to the two committees for simultaneous review, with a deadline for completion. This was the third stage of work. All three stages of work can be said to be a period of collective wisdom and benefits. After Yan gathered various opinions, he then appointed many editors to engage in editing. At that time, Mr. Yan suddenly had to stay at his private residence in Hebian Village because his father was seriously ill, and the editing had to be temporarily suspended. Subsequently, in order to actively proceed, Mr. Yan ordered four editors to bring the drafts to Hebian Village, and verbally report them to Mr. Yan one by one, so that he could understand each case and make the final decision. At this time, in addition to mainly adopting the opinions of the above-mentioned cases, Mr. Yan also incorporated the "Methods for Honest Politics and Effective Work" that he had jointly researched with the Suiyuan Office and military and political circles, and drafted a "General Outline for the Ten-Year Construction of Shanxi Province." According to this outline, a "Model and Guidelines for County and Village Construction Plans" were also drafted and added. In addition to this, Mr. Yan also thought of various practical problems in implementation, and based on the meaning of these problems (there were nine in total), he added and revised the original draft. It was not until this time that the "Collection of the Ten-Year Provincial Government Construction Plan of Shanxi Province" was formally finalized. Finally, for the sake of caution, Yan convened personnel from the military, political, and other fields for repeated discussions before making a final decision.</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Anti-Smuggling Movement</h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>Yesterday, various circles in this city held a propaganda meeting for the anti-smuggling movement at the Cloth Merchants Association. A large number of people attended and the propaganda was very enthusiastic. This kind of anti-smuggling movement is indeed necessary today. However, investigating the reason for this movement is heartbreaking. Now I will express its meaning to the people of the country.</p>
<p>Using domestic goods is a principle that patriotic people of the modern era should abide by. Neither inferior goods nor smuggled goods should be bought or sold. Even goods imported from abroad should not be bought or sold unless absolutely necessary. Now, inferior and smuggled goods are flooding the market. They are everywhere. Domestic goods are suffering exceptionally severe blows. If any of our countrymen have even a little patriotism or a little self-awareness, how can they not be alarmed by this phenomenon?</p>
<p>The people of the country should know that our compatriots in the Northeast are suffering terribly, unable to extricate themselves. The situation in North China is also alarming. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for domestic goods to develop actively. If we allow smuggled goods to flood the country, the disaster of national subjugation will come quickly. A few unscrupulous merchants are only interested in profit and do not care about the survival of the nation. Moral sanctions are ineffective. Even clearly stipulated laws and regulations may be disregarded. This is why the anti-selling and anti-buying movements must proceed simultaneously.</p>
<p>I believe that the patriotism of our countrymen is not necessarily weak. All those with blood and energy have a conscience hidden within, with no way to express it. Once stimulated, the flame of conscience can easily burn. After this propaganda meeting for the anti-smuggling movement, I sincerely hope that those who buy and sell smuggled goods will rely on their own conscience and resolutely eliminate this crime that harms the country.</p>
<p>People from neighboring countries often say that we Chinese are known for our "five-minute enthusiasm." Our patriotism often cannot be maintained permanently. Whether the people of the country can avoid this criticism today can be seen from the results after this conference.</p>

<h3>Japan Actively Increases Gold Production</h3>
<p>Bond Sales Stagnant, Affecting Budget Preparation</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the Japanese Ministry of Finance decided to ship the fifth shipment of gold, worth approximately 53 million yuan, to New York, the first batch was shipped out on the 26th of this month, worth 17 million yen. According to reliable statistics, the amounts of gold shipped out in the previous four shipments were as follows: the first shipment was 54 million yuan, the second shipment was 57 million yuan, and the third and fourth shipments were both 53 million yuan. Adding the fifth shipment of gold, the total amount of gold shipped this year is 270 million yuan. Since this year, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry have been making every effort to balance international revenue and expenditure and maintain the yen's exchange rate, requiring a large amount of gold. Therefore, they have been trying their best to increase gold production. It is now planned that within the 18 months before Showa 14 (1939), Japan will produce 70 tons of gold in the mainland, worth 233 million yuan, which is an increase of 30 tons of gold or 100 million yuan compared to the current production. However, according to expert observations, even if the government makes great efforts to develop barren mines, improve sophisticated technologies, and reduce trade taxes as incentives, it will not be able to increase the value of gold by 100 million yuan in 18 months. The highest estimate should not exceed 70 million yuan. Therefore, current close attention has shifted to encouraging and managing gold production in Manchuria.

<p>[Tokyo] The funds absorbed by Japanese financial capitalists in expanding their businesses are directly or indirectly related to the arms industry. Therefore, the sales of public bonds are extremely stagnant. According to recent statistics, the public bonds sold by the Bank of Japan from January 1st to April 4th this year were 13,700,000 yuan, which is a decrease of 362,300,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. This downward trend is extremely noteworthy, as it has a great impact on the preparation of the new budget. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<h3>The Second Day of the Jefferson Island Conference</h3>
<p>President Talks with Members of Congress, Aiming to Connect Feelings</p>
<p>⊙Annapolis President Roosevelt's "convivial banquet" on Jefferson Island is now in its second day. The first batch of Democratic congressmen returning here said that the talks on the island were mostly about eating, drinking, and entertainment, with few political issues. The President's purpose seemed to be solely to connect feelings. Therefore, after the congressmen talked with the President, they still did not know when Congress would adjourn, or which proposals were urgent and which were not. Moreover, they did not know whether there would be a compromise on the President's judicial reform proposal. The President also had a leisurely attitude, sitting under an apple tree, talking with the congressmen. Even Senator Van Nuys from Indiana, who opposed the President's judicial reform plan, said yesterday that this meeting had no effect on his opposition attitude.

<p>[London] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon is scheduled to explain in detail to the House of Commons on Monday the reasons for increasing the Exchange Equalization Fund by 200 million pounds. It is hoped that this case can be passed by the House of Commons on Friday, because the current foreign exchange market situation is particularly unstable, and the British Equalization Fund should be thickened to cope with it. The House of Commons originally intended to discuss financial proposals related to increasing agricultural land productivity on Monday, but the agenda will now be changed to discuss the increased funding for the Equalization Fund.

<h3>Germany's Economic Position in Europe</h3>
<p>Controlling Imports, the Plan is Effective</p>
<p>Berlin Dispatch Germany is in a central economic position in Europe. Food and raw materials are supplied internally, and its economic interests are closely related to various European countries. National will is to strive for the development of Germany's foreign trade, and its focus is on Europe. Before 1914, Germany's food production was insufficient to meet the needs of the country, especially fat products and animal feed, which were generally supplied by foreign countries. As a result, Germany exchanged industrial products for agricultural products from foreign countries. Despite various difficult circumstances, it was still able to rank third among the world's exporting countries (second only to Britain and the United States). After 1918, Germany became a debtor country. In addition to the total loss of the 25 billion marks of capital invested abroad before the war, it also had huge debts. This debt was reduced to 25 billion marks in 1930 and to 13 billion marks last year. Apart from the United States, European countries such as Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Sweden are Germany's creditor nations. Therefore, Germany's economic position in Europe depends closely on the turnover of debts. Although there have been extensions and delays, Germany still has to pay interest from time to time. Because in each settlement agreement, exports are used as the standard for reclaiming funds, especially in Western European countries, the seizure of Germany is the heaviest. In 1934, Germany's finances were threatened by imports, and goods were insufficient to pay for imported food and raw materials. It had no choice but to implement a new plan, setting up an import control agency to determine the quota of imported goods based on demand and repayment ability. As a result, in 1934, Germany still had an import surplus of 284,000,000 marks, but in 1936, it was able to have a net surplus of 500,000,000 marks in total trade, which shows the importance of the new plan and a glimpse of Germany's economic position.

<p>⊙Warsaw: King Carol II of Romania and President Mościcki of Poland recently observed Polish army exercises in Ogenzy, a suburb. The exercises involved over 30,000 participants, including motorized units and air squadrons. General Rydz-Śmigły, Inspector-General of the Polish Army, and Crown Prince Michael of Romania also attended. A late-night report stated that Poland is an ally of Romania, and its military strength should not be underestimated. King Carol will surely take note of this. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw: King Carol of Romania, accompanied by Crown Prince Michael and Foreign Minister Antonescu, arrived here at 4:30 PM today. President Mościcki of Poland, General Rydz-Śmigły, Inspector-General of the Army, and other high-ranking officers in uniform welcomed them at the station. After disembarking, they proceeded to the Presidential Palace. Representatives from various unofficial Polish military groups stood along the roadside to pay their respects. After leaving the Presidential Palace, King Carol went to the Łazienki Palace, his official residence. Many newspapers published articles expressing welcome, stating that this visit symbolizes a barrier of peace stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. President Mościcki also hosted a dinner at the Presidential Palace to welcome them, giving a speech in which he said, "The close relationship between our two countries over the years is clearly demonstrated by Your Majesty's visit." King Carol replied, "Poland is a friendly and allied nation of Romania. I am delighted to visit your capital in person and to be warmly welcomed by your government and people. I am further convinced that the alliance between our two countries is as solid as it should be. This alliance is in perfect harmony with the policy of solidarity among nations pursued by my country."

King Carol II did address the matter, saying, "Your Excellency (referring to President Mościcki) intends to elevate your country's legation to an embassy, which is most gratifying. My country has also sent a telegram instructing our envoy to reside in your country as an ambassador."

<h3>Polish President and Archbishop Conflict</h3>
<p>Due to the Issue of Moving the Late General's Coffin / Public Sentiment in the Country Is Indignant / Poland Negotiates with the Holy See</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw: Regarding the issue of moving the coffin of the late Minister of Military Affairs General Piłsudski, Archbishop Sapieha of the Province of Kraków insisted that it be moved from Wawel Cathedral to the "Silver Bells Tower," which caused a serious dispute with President Mościcki. However, Archbishop Sapieha is seriously ill, and his condition has worsened in recent days. It is generally believed that the archbishop's severe illness is likely caused by the above dispute. Since the dispute arose, it has caused a major reaction in Poland. All government-affiliated newspapers, except the conservative "Czas" newspaper, which was confiscated by the authorities for publishing sympathetic remarks toward the archbishop today, have unanimously expressed indignation and reprinted resolutions passed by public organizations across the country, either advocating for the immediate convening of parliament or demanding the arrest of the reactionary Archbishop Sapieha. At the same time, citizens in the capital held demonstrations to express their opposition. Demonstrators marched to the Vatican Embassy to denounce the archbishop and vandalized the Catholic newspaper "Mały Dziennik." In addition, veteran organizations condemned the archbishop's arrogance. Government-affiliated professional groups and labor unions issued orders for their members to strike for five minutes in protest. There has been no shortage of voices of opposition. According to news from the Vatican, the Polish Chargé d'Affaires to the Holy See has contacted Cardinal Pacelli, the Vatican Secretary of State, regarding this matter.

<p>⊙Madrid: The Northern forces of the Nationalist army are currently advancing from Bilbao towards Santander, but are clearly making large-scale preparations for an attack on Madrid. This morning, the Nationalist army repeatedly attacked government fortresses in the Jarama area, attempting to restore transportation routes there, but with minimal effect. At the same time, military movements north of the capital and in Guadalajara province are continuing. Furthermore, the Biscay Nationalist forces advanced five miles along the coast yesterday, reaching just three miles from Guetaria, the first target for an attack on Santander. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>⊙Bilbao: Nationalist forces are rapidly advancing along the Santander highway and have surrounded Valmaseda, a key military town and former industrial and transportation center. According to a Nationalist radio broadcast, the food supply situation in Bilbao has returned to normal since the Nationalist forces occupied the city. The reservoirs in the suburbs are also now under Nationalist control, so the water supply should return to normal in the coming days. Hotels, cafes, and most shops have reopened, and cinemas are operating as usual. Yesterday, over 800 militiamen from the government forces surrendered to the Nationalist forces. Nationalist advance units advancing along the Santander highway towards Valmaseda have captured many strategic locations and crossed the village of Somorrostro, capturing many positions on the border between Biscay and Santander provinces.

<h3>Spanish Government Grain Ship Sunk by Submarine</h3>
<p>Sufficient to Form a Disturbing New Factor / German Ships in Spanish Waters Increasing Steadily</p>
<p>⊙Alicante: The Spanish government ship "Gabo Carlos," fully loaded with food, departed from here for Valencia this morning. When it reached the sea 28 kilometers north of this port, it was suddenly attacked by a torpedo launched from a submarine of unknown nationality. The "Gabo Carlos" immediately sank, and five sailors were killed. The other forty-four were rescued by nearby fishing boats and returned to this port, where they reported the attack to the authorities. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>[London] After the Spanish government ship "Gabo Carlos" was sunk by a submarine, those here who sympathize with the Spanish Nationalist forces claim that it was done by a submarine belonging to the Nationalist forces. Those who sympathize with the Spanish Republican government say that the Nationalist forces only have two submarines, both of which are old and not in good working order. The sinking of the "Gabo Carlos" must have been caused by a submarine of some hostile country. The British Admiralty will not comment until it has obtained detailed information. British political figures say that Britain and France recently made proposals to replace Germany and Italy in carrying out the surveillance work. At a time when Germany and Italy are about to issue replies, the "Gabo Carlos" incident occurred, which is sufficient to form a disturbing factor. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Since withdrawing from the Spanish naval surveillance plan, Germany has increased its naval presence there, reinforcing its strength. Most importantly, the 10,000-ton pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" was sent on the 23rd of this month. In total, there are now 23 German warships, large and small, patrolling Spanish waters, most of which are new-style warships, including the 10,000-ton pocket battleships "Admiral Scheer" and "Admiral Graf Spee," five 6,000-ton light cruisers, twelve 8,000-ton destroyers, and four of the latest submarines. Regarding the location of these warships, the German Admiralty originally submitted daily reports since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, but has not made any public announcements recently. It is unknown whether they are still concentrated in the Mediterranean Sea near Valencia, Spain, the area originally monitored by German warships. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Catalonia Government Reorganized</h3>
<p>Recruiting Various Left-Wing Parties / Becoming a Wartime Organization</p>
<p>⊙Barcelona: The government of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia is being reorganized. President Companys of the regional government recently delivered a radio broadcast, saying, "The new government will become a wartime organization so that victory belongs to us. The people of the region must accept the greatest sacrifices under the current circumstances. The new government must also purify the rear to prevent traitors from causing chaos." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>⊙Barcelona: After the political upheaval in the government of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia yesterday, it is being reorganized smoothly. Well-informed sources here predict that the new government will be the same as before the anarchist uprising in May, but with one major change: the socialist Workers' General Union will reportedly refuse to participate, while the Third International's Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia has agreed to cooperate. Thus, the number of representatives from each party in the new government will be no more than: ㊀ three from the moderate Republican party, i.e., the Republican Left of Catalonia; ㊁ three from the anarchist National Confederation of Labor; ㊂ three from the Unified Socialist Party; and ㊃ one from the Tenant Farmers' Party. The right-wing "Catalan Action Party" and "Catalan Nationalist Party" will reportedly be prohibited from participating in the new cabinet. In addition, there are rumors that non-partisan figures such as the famous linguist Pompeu Fabra and the playwright Adrià Gual will also participate. Regarding the allocation of cabinet seats, the moderate Republican Party will likely hold the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Education. The anarchist National Confederation of Labor will hold the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Social Welfare, and the Ministry of Economy and Food. The Unified Socialist Party will hold the Ministry of Labor and Public Works, and the Ministry of Justice and Propaganda. The position of Minister of Agriculture will still be held by a representative of the Tenant Farmers' Party. Furthermore, the current President of the Autonomous Region, Companys, will reportedly retain his position. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Non-Intervention Committee to Meet Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Britain and France to Undertake Surveillance / Italy and Germany State Their Positions</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee of the Spanish Conflict Non-Intervention Committee is scheduled to meet on Tuesday morning to first consider the naval surveillance plan. At that time, the representatives of Britain and France will express their governments' willingness to use their warships to carry out all surveillance work. The issue of neutral countries providing personnel for the surveillance ships to monitor whether they are impartial in carrying out their surveillance duties will also be discussed. If there is enough time, the subcommittee will also discuss the issue of withdrawing volunteers from Spain, especially the British proposal to find a way to withdraw the volunteers as soon as possible. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[London] Britain is preparing a final effort today to bridge the rifts in the Non-Intervention Agreement Committee and avert a European war crisis. It is understood that Britain will propose to independently monitor the western Mediterranean coast of Spain to reduce the tensions arising from Germany's refusal to mediate. Germany has indicated that it will jointly oppose the British and French proposal to monitor the entire coast of Spain. Some observers believe that Britain, in view of the attitudes of Italy and Germany, which have made it impossible for the committee to function, may threaten to withdraw from the committee. If Italy and Germany reject the committee's proposals at the meeting on Monday, the committee will ask Italy and Germany to make alternative proposals. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Italy's opposition to the British and French surveillance of the Spanish coast seems to have softened slightly today, as Italy has shown some understanding of the British proposal. At the same time, it can avoid Soviet Russia's participation or sending personnel to inspect the surveillance ships. Furthermore, the possibility that Italy and Germany may also send personnel to inspect the surveillance ships seems to have also eased Italy's attitude. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] After Britain and France proposed that they undertake the surveillance of the Spanish waters formerly undertaken by Germany and Italy, the German side's attitude was relatively moderate. However, today the newspapers have regrouped and are conducting a major propaganda campaign on the Spanish issue, while deliberately not mentioning a word about the French proposal to send neutral inspectors to participate in the surveillance on the warships. The "Angriff" newspaper said, "So far, the loyalty of Britain and France to non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War cannot be proven. Therefore, if Britain and France are solely responsible for surveillance, it is doubtful that the non-intervention measures can be effectively implemented." The "Nachtausgabe" newspaper said, "Italy has formally made reservations about the British and French plan. If Britain and France carry out surveillance alone, it is difficult to trust their impartiality. Moreover, Britain and France have no right to make decisions in the name of the countries attending the London Adjustment Committee to reorganize the naval surveillance work." The "General-Anzeiger" stated, "This proposal by Britain and France is merely a question of raising the issue. As for the method of deciding on a solution, it should be decided by the Adjustment Committee." It also said, "The speeches delivered by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons yesterday are difficult for Germany to be satisfied with." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The newspapers here are taking a non-committal attitude in commenting on the British and French plan for warships to monitor the entire coast of Spain. The "Corriere della Sera" said, "Britain and France want to change the surveillance of the Spanish waters formerly undertaken by Germany and Italy to be carried out by the British and French navies. In fact, this issue is not of concern to us. Whether Britain and France carry out surveillance or not, the navies of Italy and Germany must still protect their national interests in those waters and elsewhere." As a result of diplomatic talks held repeatedly in London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin in the past two days, the general situation has eased. Responsible sources claim that Germany and Italy are unlikely to endorse the British and French plan without limitations and that Germany and Italy will decide their attitude depending on the circumstances.

<h3>Italian Newspapers Praise British Prime Minister's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Rome] The Italian public has generally praised the speech delivered by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons on Friday, saying that the heavens should think about European peace and maintain a calm and restrained attitude. Most newspapers have echoed the editorial in the Italian "Il Popolo d'Italia," calling the prime minister's remarks clever and timely. The author of the editorial is not named, but it is widely believed to be Prime Minister Mussolini himself. The editorial also denounces Bolshevik policies and the Spanish government, and condemns the "lies" of newspapers in various countries and the fascist press, saying that if the anti-fascist world is allowed to shout and lie as much as possible, what will ravage Europe will not only be the collapse of ice and snow, but also floods and destruction.

<h3>German Socialist Party Celebrates Political Participation in Danzig</h3>
<p>⊙Free City of Danzig: Today is the fourth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's participation in the city government. The newspapers belonging to the party have written articles to celebrate this occasion. The "Danziger Neueste Nachrichten" stated, "Danzig has never belonged to Poland and will never belong to Poland in the future. Among all the cities under the jurisdiction of the great German fatherland, Danzig has the most intense German character. It is no longer possible for former President of the Senate of Danzig, Rauschning, to make Danzig assimilate with Poland." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Mexico Streamlines Railway Administration</h3>
<p>⊙Mexico City: President Cárdenas recently decided to allow railway workers to directly participate in railway administration in the future. After all the railways in Mexico were nationalized, internal management is now being streamlined. To enable workers to cooperate in streamlining railway administration, the President made this decision. In the future, most of the civil servants in the newly established Railway Bureau should be selected from members of the railway workers' union. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>US Bethlehem Steel Plant Workers Secretly Resume Work</h3>
<p>⊙Johnstown, Pennsylvania: Since the labor dispute occurred at the Bethlehem Steel Plant here, Governor Earle ordered the plant to temporarily close in order to maintain order and avoid bloodshed. The plant's workers were deeply dissatisfied and requested to resume work yesterday. After notifying each other by telephone at night, they sneaked into the plant and resumed work on their own. A total of 4,000 people, accounting for about 70% of the plant's workers, entered the plant. Because there were no pickets from the striking workers outside the plant, no incidents occurred.

<p>Simple Ceremony Without Extravagance / Over Forty Years Old, Her Charm Remains</p>
<p>⊙Los Angeles: Mary Pickford, the "America's Sweetheart" of the silent film era, married actor Buddy Rogers today. The wedding ceremony was very simple, a stark contrast to the extravagant situation when she married Douglas Fairbanks in 1920. The actress is forty-four years old, but in her blue shirt and ochre hat, her charm remains. She still looks like she is twenty-nine years old. After the wedding, the newlyweds received guests at the Pickfair mansion. Then they boarded a ship to Honolulu for their honeymoon. The actress is a major shareholder of United Artists and is one of the wealthiest actresses in the world. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>American Sailor Causes Trouble While Drunk at Qingdao Railway Station</h3>
<p>Sneaks into Train and Drives it Forward / Three Cars Destroyed, Fortunately No One Hurt</p>
<p>[Qingdao] At 4:00 AM on the 27th, an American sailor named Hallock was drunk after leaving a dance hall and wandered to Qingdao Railway Station, where he caused a major disaster. The sailor had driving skills and saw engine No. 512 on the tracks, so he sneaked into the engine and drove it forward, causing two material transport freight cars and one third-class passenger car parked at the station to be destroyed. The front of the engine was also damaged. Fortunately, no one was hurt. After the crash, the sailor jumped down and was surrounded by station staff. According to personnel from the locomotive depot, if there had been no passenger and freight cars blocking the way at the station, the engine driven by the sailor would have crashed into buildings or driven onto the street. In the afternoon, the railway authorities sent the sailor to the US Consulate for disposal. However, the US warship did not recognize Hallock as an American sailor. In addition to negotiating with the US Consulate, the railway authorities urgently telegraphed a report to the Ministry of Railways. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Political and Economic Power of Mitsui, Japan's Leading Zaibatsu</h3>
<p>— Nangyun</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>Today, financial capital controls four-fifths of the world. Japan is a part of that four-fifths. Among Japan's financial capitalists, Mitsui is the largest, with capital estimated at 25% of Japan's total wealth. It wields enormous influence in both political and economic spheres. Analyzing Mitsui's entire development process is helpful for understanding Japan. Moreover, the relationship between China and Japan is particularly unique at present. China has lost vast territories, and the Chinese people are experiencing significant threats and oppression: these threats and oppression are gifts bestowed upon China by world capitalism—especially Japan. Those representing the interests of capitalism are only a minority in any country. The hardworking masses and the general petty bourgeoisie, like the masses in colonies or semi-colonies, endure the agony of survival and the pain of life. Japan should be no exception to this phenomenon.</p>
<p>The lives of the Japanese masses are much harder than before. The social contradictions in Japan are also more profound than before. To avoid the current crisis, the financial capitalists who control Japan naturally want to expand their colonies. How closely is the expansion of colonies related to our country? There are still very few articles researching Japanese zaibatsu in domestic publications. In my opinion, it is necessary to introduce the development and trends of Japan's largest financial capitalists to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>(2) The Origin of the Mitsui Surname</p>
<p>The Mitsui family, which holds the central nerve of Japan's capital world, was merely a sake and soy sauce brewing shop in 1633. The history of the Mitsui family is quite interesting. Their original surname was Fujiwara. More than nine hundred years ago, they belonged to the samurai class and possessed large estates and power in the Omi area. Later, for some unknown reason, they abandoned city life and moved to a village called "Mitsui." At the same time, they also abandoned the surname Fujiwara and adopted the surname Mitsui from their place of residence. This Mitsui is the Mitsui zaibatsu of today, with a total capital of 5.51 billion yuan, dominating Japan's financial and industrial circles, and even more powerfully controlling Japanese politics.</p>
<p>Speaking of Japan's current nobility, everyone knows that the Konoe family, with Prince Konoe Fumimaro as the speaker of the House of Peers, is the highest lineage. However, Prince Konoe himself uses a seal that reads "Fujiwara Fumimaro." After the September 18th Incident, Mitsui even donated a large sum of money to build a hall commemorating Prince Konoe's deceased father. In this way, both the Konoe family and the Mitsui family are descended from "Fujiwara." We have no need to investigate the lineage of these nobles and zaibatsu, but from this fact, we can see Mitsui's power and the feudal nature of Japanese capitalism.</p>
<p>However, the so-called history of the Mitsui family only began in 1633. That was when the family was squeezed out of the samurai class and became merchants. It is very important that Mitsui was able to escape the declining fate of the samurai class and emerge as a rising bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>(3) Mitsui's Development</p>
<p>Three hundred and four years ago, the Mitsui family brewed sake and made soy sauce. Two hundred and sixty-five years ago, the Mitsui family opened a kimono (Japanese clothing) and silk shop called Echigoya in Tokyo. Everyone living in Japan today knows about the magnificent and world-famous Mitsukoshi Department Store. This Mitsukoshi company developed from Echigoya and is also the initial commercial foundation of the Mitsui Kingdom in Tokyo.</p>
<p>After opening the kimono store, the Mitsui family then established two money exchanges. These money exchanges were the predecessors of today's Mitsui Bank.</p>
<p>The Meiji Restoration was the first step for Japan to embark on modern capitalism. This restoration was successfully supported by Mitsui's financial power. On the surface, it was loyalty to the emperor and devotion to the country, but in reality, it was an expression of the rising bourgeoisie against feudalism. The Meiji Restoration was also the Mitsui Restoration. This restoration was an important key to the development of the Mitsui zaibatsu.</p>
<p>Because Mitsui actively supported the new government, all government policies from the Meiji era onwards—especially financial policies—were largely determined by Mitsui's intentions. At the same time, most of those responsible for implementing the policies were Mitsui's subordinates. The enormous political dominance of the Mitsui zaibatsu in the Meiji government cannot be denied.</p>
<p>The development process of the Mitsui zaibatsu is the same as that of general capitalists, that is, from commercial capital to industrial capital, and then from industrial capital to the stage of financial capital monopoly. To talk about Mitsui's industry, one must first mention the Miike Coal Mine. The Miike Coal Mine was originally owned by the Japanese state, but in the early Meiji era, Mitsui bought it for 4.5 million yuan. After acquiring it, they greatly reorganized it. Within a few years, they not only earned back the purchase price of 4.5 million yuan but also gained many benefits. Currently, the Miike Coal Mine produces 3 million tons of coal annually. At 10 yuan per ton, the annual revenue is 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>After that, Mitsui successively acquired many coal mines. From Kyushu in the south to Hokkaido, Mitsui's coal mines can be seen along the way. No wonder the Japanese say: "Mitsui's wealth comes from coal."</p>
<p>Mitsui has a total of seven coal mines, producing 8,233,980 tons of coal annually. According to the latest survey, Japan's total annual coal production is 32,523,000 tons. So, Mitsui's coal production accounts for 25.1% of Japan's total coal production.</p>
<p>In addition to coal mines, Mitsui also has gold, silver, copper, and tin mines. The companies controlled by these mines total more than twenty. Furthermore, as an ancillary business to the coal industry, there are dye and chemical industries, such as the Miike Dye Industry Plant (manufacturing fertilizers, industrial chemicals, explosives, dyes, chemical weapons...) and the Miike Smelting Plant (manufacturing zinc, sulfuric acid...).</p>
<p>Three major events promoted Mitsui's development: first, the Sino-Japanese War; second, the Russo-Japanese War; and third, World War I. During the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's domestic military-demand industry prospered, which gave the newly emerging Mitsui industry enormous benefits. After the Sino-Japanese War, Japan seized East Asia's largest market, and Mitsui's capital network greatly expanded to China and Taiwan. Mitsui obtained abundant raw materials from China, manufactured goods from these raw materials, and then exported these goods abroad. From then on, Mitsui Bussan (founded in 1876, with a capital of 50,000 yuan, now increased to 100 million yuan) greatly developed, and Mitsui's goods were imported into China in large quantities, as well as Europe and the United States. That is to say, the emerging Japanese capitalism has since become an important link in the chain of world capitalism. Writing this, I cannot help but feel sorrow, only because of China's political corruption, which led China into a miserable semi-colonial state, serving as a stepping stone for the development of Japanese capitalism. The development of the Mitsui zaibatsu is the epitome of the development of Japanese capitalism. This zaibatsu's development is closely related to the invasion of China each time.</p>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese War was the Russo-Japanese War. The result of the Russo-Japanese War determined Japan's power in Northeast China. From then on, most of the special products of the Northeast were managed by Mitsui. The special products of the Northeast were sold on the world market, and Mitsui's power also gained a more important position in the world market.</p>
<p>World War I brought Japanese capitalism to its peak, and Mitsui's capital accumulation also developed to the stage of financial capital monopoly. This can be understood by looking at the accumulation of capital in Mitsui Bank.</p>
<p>Mitsui Bank, Mitsui Trust, and Mitsui Life Insurance are the most important departments in the Mitsui zaibatsu's financial capital. Mitsui Bank's funds were only 20 million yuan in 1914 (when the European War began), but by 1919, they had already developed to 60 million yuan. This figure has continued to the present. The number of deposits has recently increased by more than 336,510,000 yuan compared to 1919. In addition, the funds of Mitsui Trust and Mitsui Life Insurance are also increasing rapidly. What does this illustrate? This illustrates the capital monopoly of the Mitsui zaibatsu, the inevitable bankruptcy of rural villages and the inevitable maturity and strength of the labor class in Japan, and it further illustrates the danger in Japan after entering the imperialist stage: thus, the September 18th Incident occurred. This incident strengthened the ruling class of Japan, temporarily anesthetized the general petty bourgeoisie struggling in difficult lives, and slowed down the fighting spirit of the labor class.</p>

<h3>Popular Uprisings in "Eastern Hebei" Repeatedly Occur; Yin Ni Eagerly Seeks Help from Tashiro</h3>
<p>Currently Expanding the Pseudo-Security Force; Various Pseudo-Captains Secretly Plot to Overthrow Yin</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Due to the unbearable oppression by the pseudo-organization, the people of various counties in "Eastern Hebei" have repeatedly launched popular uprisings. In May of this year, Yin Ni designated Fengrun, Yutian, Luanxian, Funing, and other counties as martial law zones, ordering his newly compiled pseudo-security supplemental force to be stationed in Changli, Guye, and other places to suppress them. Starting from the beginning of this month, he also searched and confiscated self-defense firearms from the people. At that time, the people of various counties mostly concealed and did not report or hand them over. On the night of the 16th of this month, the Lian Zhuang Hui (joint village association) of 21 villages in northern Yutian County, in order to refuse to hand over firearms, finally engaged in a fierce battle with the pseudo-security supplemental force in the suburbs, holding out for a day and a night. Subsequently, the pseudo-county magistrate of Yutian, Wang Hongzun, stepped in to mediate, and the villagers retreated into the village, with many deaths. At the same time, similar popular uprisings also occurred in Shunyi, Miyun, and other counties. Moreover, the people of various counties further declared their opposition to apportioning excessive taxes and levies in order to resist Yin Ni's plundering of cash. The reason is that in addition to ordering the pseudo-"Eastern Hebei" Bank to issue unlimited and non-redeemable pseudo-currency, Yin Ni recently issued so-called "Construction Bonds" worth 500,000 yuan, forcibly distributing them to chambers of commerce in various counties for sale. The people's suffering has increased, so they rose up to resist. Yin Ni, using the excuse of frequent disturbances in the pseudo-territory, came to Tianjin from Tongxian on the morning of the 21st to visit Tashiro, the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, to seek assistance. It is reported that the results of Yin Ni's consultation in Tianjin were to expand the strength of the pseudo-organization. The quota for the pseudo-security force was changed to three district teams per brigade, with 500 people per district team and 1,500 people per brigade. The defense zones were redistributed, stipulating that the First Brigade of the pseudo-security force would be stationed in Miyun, Shunyi, and other counties; the Second Brigade of the pseudo-security force would be stationed in Luanxian, Fengrun, and other counties; the Third Brigade of the pseudo-security force would be stationed in Tongxian, Xianghe, and other counties; and the Fourth Brigade of the pseudo-security force would be stationed in Funing, Linjian, and other counties. The various pseudo-captains, Zhang Yantian, Han Zexin, Zhang Qingyu, Li Haitian, etc., were all promoted to the rank of major general. The pseudo-security supplemental force under Li Ni Ningzhang was responsible for guerrilla warfare throughout "Eastern Hebei." However, Yin Ni regarded Li Ni Ningzhang's pseudo-security supplemental force as his trusted subordinates. Their salaries, weapons, and uniforms were different from other security brigades, which caused dissatisfaction among the four pseudo-captains. Currently, the four captains are united and secretly plotting to overthrow Yin and support Ma Tingfu, a former division commander under Shi Yousan, as their leader. However, they are still afraid of a certain party and must wait for an opportunity before daring to launch. The reason is that most of the "Eastern Hebei" pseudo-security force was reorganized from Ma Tingfu's old troops, and Zhang Qingyu is particularly a trusted former subordinate of Ma. Overthrowing Yin and supporting Ma is in their intentions. (25th)</p>
<h3>The Yellow River's Water Level Rises Continuously; Precarious Situation</h3>
<p>The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has Telegraphed its Subordinates to Take Strict Precautions; Rush Construction of Willow and Stone Dams in the Taipingzhuang Area</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: According to a telegram from Longmen, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission reported that at 4:00 on the 24th, the water level was 90.75, and the flow rate was approximately 4,000 cubic meters per second. Also, according to a telegram from the Shanzhou station yesterday, at 0:00 on the 25th, the water level was 293.77, and the flow rate was 4,250 cubic meters per second. Last night, heavy rain poured down, with rainfall in Kaifeng reaching 152.5 millimeters. The upper reaches of the Luo River also experienced the same heavy rain. The commission is deeply concerned that the tributaries will swell and converge, which will increase the flow rate of the main river. Strict precautions should be taken to avoid negligence. It has telegraphed the Henan, Shandong, and Hebei River Affairs Bureau to strengthen protection day and night and not be negligent. It has also instructed the commission's resident inspectors to pay attention to coordination and defense and report promptly. If necessary, Kong Xiangrong, the chairman of the commission, plans to pursue the flood peak and supervise the defense.</p>
<p>The old shoal in the Taipingzhuang area downstream of Heigangkou, Henan, collapsed last year, with a length of more than 1,200 meters and a width of more than 100 meters. The situation is quite serious. Fortunately, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission rushed to build a willow and stone dam there, which temporarily stabilized the situation. Kong Xiangrong, the chairman of the commission, inspected the area a few days ago and believed that the site was too long, the dam stalls were too far apart, and the situation was still isolated. If faced with a direct rushing current, the upper and lower empty stalls would lack protection and inevitably lead to danger. In order to prevent collapse and protect the safety of the provincial capital, it is necessary to add two willow and stone dams and protect the coastal engineering. The commission has dispatched engineer Wu Yinyi as the director of the project office there to start construction and rush to complete it before the big flood. It has also transferred Zhang Guisheng, the deputy captain of the commission's first engineering team, to lead the team members to assist in the work. It is reported that after receiving the commission, engineer Wu has gone to the area to rush to work. (26th)</p>
<h3>New Wheat Enters the Market, but Grain Prices in Jinan Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Poor Wheat Harvest in Northern and Southern Shandong Province; Japanese Merchants and Flour Mills Engage in Purchases</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since last winter, grain prices in this city have risen without falling. The value of wheat is between 6.1 yuan and 7.1 yuan per 100 jin, and flour is 4.23 yuan per bag, which is an unprecedented record. The people below the poverty line, who used to have just enough to live on, are now struggling to make ends meet. Fortunately, the new wheat harvest has entered the market one after another. In theory, wheat prices should fall, and it is generally speculated that they could fall to 5 yuan, and flour would be no more than 3.5 yuan per bag. However, the actual situation is quite different. Grain prices have been rising for days without decreasing. Wheat prices still average 6.7 to 7 yuan, with medium-quality goods at 6.5 to 6.6 yuan. Flour, which was 4.15 yuan per bag a week ago, has now risen to 4.3 yuan. It is reported that there are several reasons for this: ① The wheat harvest in the suburbs of Jinan is poor, and some southern villages cannot even recover their wheat seeds. ② The city's reserves are too low. In the past, 4,000 to 5,000 tons, or even 10,000 tons, were stored, but since last year to this spring, only 2,000 tons were stored, which were all bought up by flour mills before the new wheat entered the market. ③ There was a South Manchurian flour mill on Weiba Road in Jinan, which was operated by the Japanese. It has been closed for many years. After the machinery was sold to the Qingdao Hengxing Flour Mill, the factory buildings gradually deteriorated. Until last year, when the Japanese loudly advocated investing in North China, the factory began to brew its revival. The factory buildings have been renovated, and machinery parts have been shipped from Qingdao one after another. As soon as they arrive, they will begin installation (expected to be completed by the end of September, with 18 steel mills, capable of producing 5,000 bags of flour per day and night). It is heard that it has entrusted grain stores such as Xingshunfu to purchase wheat on its behalf, so people's hearts are becoming more and more agitated. ④ The seven flour mills in Jinan have always relied on wheat sources from Bengbu, Xuzhou, Tengxian, Yanzhou on the southern route, and Pingyuan, Dezhou, etc. on the northern route. This year, the northern route has little supply, and the southern route has also increased prices repeatedly due to purchases by Tianjin merchants. There are not many sources. According to statistics, the existing wheat in Jinan is only 1,200 to 1,300 tons. Therefore, the price rose by 1 jiao on the 20th, continued to rise by 3 jiao on the 21st, and on the 22nd, the flour mills collectively reduced prices due to the excessive price increase, but no transactions were made. On the 23rd, the market price was still very high, and there seems to be no hope of falling recently. (23rd)</p>
<h3>All Sectors in Xiamen Launch Movement to Collect Scrap Copper and Iron</h3>
<p>Establish Promotion Association to Mobilize Collection; Stipulate Methods for Active Implementation</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: In the past six months, a large amount of scrap copper and iron has been privately smuggled out of Minnan (southern Fujian) Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen by traitors. The reason is that a certain country is preparing for war, and there is a shortage of raw materials, so it is buying old scrap copper and iron in large quantities at high prices, which are privately smuggled out by vagrants and traitors. The destinations are Hong Kong and Taiwan. Although customs occasionally seizes them, the amount that leaks out is very large. Recently, schools and social groups, driven by patriotism, have launched a movement to collect copper and iron to contribute to the country. Xiamen City has also established the "Xiamen He All Sectors Collection of Scrap Copper and Iron Contribution to the Nation Promotion Association" last month to unify the steps of the movement. The Municipal Party Department, Municipal Government, Naval Port Headquarters, Water Police, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Education Association, Heshan Special Zone Office, Gulangyu Chinese Council, Social Military Training Headquarters, General Labor Union Women's Federation, Citizen Education Hall, He People Education Hall, various agencies, and Chongshi, Jingzai, Fishermen, Datong Ziyang, Qunsi, Xiamen Middle School, Yude, Heshan, First Central Elementary School, Yanling, and other schools are jointly responsible for hosting, and the implementation methods are stipulated as follows: ① June 26 to July 10 is the first period for collecting copper and iron. ② After the end-of-term exams, teachers and staff of each school should urge students to collect for three days. ③ The Social Military Training Headquarters should lead the members of the second phase of social training teams in the city to mobilize collection for one day during the first collection period. ④ The Citizen Education Hall, Fishermen's Elementary School, Datong Elementary School, and Chongshi Elementary School are designated as places for the public to automatically contribute scrap copper and iron in the city. Heshan schools and various Lianbao offices, and Gulangyu Puyu Elementary School are designated as places for automatic contribution in Heshan and Gulangyu. ⑤ The steel obtained will be kept by the Municipal Government in Xiamen, by the Special Zone Office in Heshan, and by the Chinese Council in Gulangyu. ⑥ The Municipal Government and the Heshan Special Zone Office should instruct the various Baojia to order the people not to sell scrap copper and iron arbitrarily. After the methods were stipulated, large-scale collection began on the 26th. (June 26th)</p>

<p>Reorganization of the Japanese Consulate in Suzhou</p>
<p>The Japanese Consulate in Suzhou has always been directly under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<p>A pawn dispute occurred in Tongsheng Pawnshop in Wuqufang. After Liu Zhengkang, Fan Junbo, and others mediated, the labor side voluntarily agreed to terminate the contract, but the capital side had to compensate for 140 months of use and wages. The capital side only agreed to 40 months, so the mediation broke down. Both labor and capital sides submitted petitions to the Party and government agencies for relief. The county government will convene the county Party headquarters to mediate again. However, the labor side has no sincerity. It is heard that it has hired lawyer Bo Zhu to prepare to resolve the matter with the capital side through legal means.</p>

<p>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Tracks Damaged by Water</p>
<p>Due to continuous moldy rain in the counties upstream of the Qiantang River, floods broke out, and the water level continued to rise. On the morning of the 27th, the water level was the same height as the Yidu Wharf, and some of it had already flooded. Fortunately, it receded slightly by about one meter at noon. All small steamers except the Linpu line are still suspended. Yidu is still running around, maintaining traffic. Along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, mountain floods also rose sharply. The water level near Bailutang Station near Xiaoshan is about three or four feet high, and the tracks are destroyed and submerged for more than ten miles.

There are currently 572 power users, with 14,811 horsepower of electric motors installed, and 16,518 lighting users, with a total of 57,395 amps of electricity meters installed. Wu Yulin, the director of the factory, believes that Wuxi and Wujin are prosperous industrial and commercial areas, urgently needing electricity. However, the power is limited and will soon be insufficient. After repeated planning, it was decided to build a second power plant. The location was surveyed and determined to be Shagang Port in Xinan Township, District 3 of Xishu, requisitioning 412.924 mu of people's land. It is heard that the power generation of the plant is 60,000 watts and is expected to be completed within three years.</p>

<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Districts Eight and Nine Petition to Open Dams</p>

<p>Designing the Construction of Zhongzheng Bridge</p>
<p>Zhu Meixian, the director-general of the Zhongzheng Bridge Construction Preparation Committee, Chen Shouzhi, the director of the design team, and others arrived in Yong by boat from Shanghai on the morning of the 26th and surveyed the Xinjiang Bridge, which is planned to be rebuilt into the Zhongzheng Bridge. According to Zhu's and others' opinions, the Xinjiang Bridge is 430 feet long. For stability during reconstruction, a three-hole bridge must be used. However, this will affect both the cost and the waterway. Therefore, it is proposed to rebuild a single-hole circular large iron bridge, moving the southern end of the bridge to the Sitong Lane intersection in Yongdong. This will shorten the bridge body by 20 feet. Zhu and others returned to Shanghai on the same boat that day and submitted the planned design to the conference for review.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>New Cotton Developing Well</p>
<p>In the counties of Nantong and the coastal reclamation areas, the new cotton seeds sown this year have shown excellent growth due to favorable rainfall. Seed breeding is being carried out in different zones, and promotion from central cotton fields in various locations is progressing smoothly. The cotton fields this year have increased by approximately one-fifth. Currently, the cotton improvement office is focusing on preventing insect infestations.</p>
<p>Public Property Office Reorganized</p>
<p>The Nantong County Public Funds and Public Property Management Office has been reorganized by the county government. Liu Shiru is the director, and Yuan Zhixian is the deputy director.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Planting Sorghum Prohibited Near the Railway</p>
<p>The Huainan Railway Bureau, citing the sparsely populated area between Shuangdunjiji and Tianjia'an in northern Hefei, which makes it a frequent haunt for bandits, and for the sake of ensuring traffic safety and local security, has sent a letter to the Hefei County Government. The letter instructs the Baos and Jiazhangs of Shuangdunjiji and Tianjia'an to notify farmers that they are not allowed to plant sorghum within half a li of the railway line. Those who have already planted sorghum must quickly remove it and plant other ground cover to maintain traffic and ensure safety. The county government issued a strict order to the Baos and Jiazhangs along the line to comply on the 25th.</p>
<p>Businesses Refuse to Use Electric Lights</p>
<p>In previous years, the Hefei Yaoyuan Electric Light Company's lights were extremely bright. However, due to the company's business expansion and the small size of the generators, the light intensity has greatly diminished. This year, due to internal disagreements and excessive electricity fees, the electricity is turned on too late every night, and the lights are intermittent and dim. Businesses throughout the city believe that this not only affects business but also easily leads to other dangers. Therefore, they have sent letters to the company, requesting them to send workers to cut the wires and not use electric lights, switching to gas lamps instead. They also declared that they would not pay electricity fees from the evening of the 23rd. The County Chamber of Commerce has also issued a notice warning the company, asking it to find a way to improve the situation. The company's directors and shareholders are currently holding meetings to discuss improvement and remediation measures.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin</h3>
<p>North Gate Bridge Construction Rushed</p>
<p>The pontoon bridge at the North Gate of the county town has become unsuitable since Qing Yang changed the city road. Therefore, the existing bridge boats are being moved to the upstream Sea God Temple location to facilitate pedestrian traffic. A new-style bridge is being built at the Beidou Wharf. Construction has been underway for over a month, and all the bridge piles have been driven. Just as the bridge deck was about to be built, the canal water level suddenly rose six inches yesterday (the 26th) and continues to rise. Engineering supervisors, knowing that the flood season is approaching, feared that further water level increases would jeopardize the work if they did not work overnight. Therefore, starting last night, they have been working night shifts to ensure early completion.</p>

<p>Speeches from All Sides</p>
<p>Zhou Weigang, the representative of the Training Directorate, then delivered a speech, explaining the importance of combating the teaching of shame.

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Submits a Petition to the Executive and Ministerial Departments to Intensify Anti-Smuggling Efforts</h3>
<p>And to Maintain the Original Import Tariff</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry yesterday. The petition concerned the request to maintain the original import tariffs and to intensify anti-smuggling efforts. The proposal stated, "Import tariffs are originally intended to protect domestic industries. Our country's current tariff rates are inferior to those of other countries in the world, so domestic industries are easily eliminated by imported goods. Since the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935], a certain country has engaged in large-scale smuggling, which has severely impacted our national industries. Recently, it has used the pretext that our country's import tariff rates are too high to encourage so-called 'special trade,' threatening to reduce tariffs. If this is easily conceded, it would be fatal to our industries. The government should be petitioned to maintain the original tariffs and to intensify anti-smuggling efforts to strengthen the national foundation." After discussion, the general assembly agreed that our country has always strived for tariff autonomy, hoping to increase tax revenue to enrich the national treasury and to protect industries to establish a foothold in the market. The import tariff regulations revised on May 22, 1933, slightly contain elements of protecting domestic industries, but compared with the tariff systems of other countries in the world, they already appear inadequate. Moreover, they were revised again on July 3, 1934, with many tariff rates reduced, showing a clear intention of good neighborliness to the world. The state is focusing on economic construction as a national policy, and the protection of private industries is also mentioned in the declaration of the Third Plenary Session. Therefore, the fact that today's tariffs cannot be slightly protective is both the result of many years of seeking autonomy and the inevitable trend of industrial prosperity today. Moreover, the state's annual revenue has always been led by tariffs, which are related to the budget and national affairs. How can they be easily reduced again? If smuggling is used as a tool to threaten tariff reductions, then the only way to implement the policy of tariff autonomy today is to intensify anti-smuggling efforts, so as to avoid secret losses of national funds and the overflow of profits. It was resolved to submit separate petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting them to adhere to their established views and implement their policies. This is for the public good."</p>
<h3>Kawagoe Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow to Meet Ambassador Xu</h3>

He is scheduled to arrive at the Yangshupu Huixiao Wharf at approximately 2:00 PM tomorrow. Japanese Consul in Beijing, Hidaka Shinrokuro, Japanese military and naval officials stationed in Shanghai, and Japanese community groups, as well as Zhou Jue, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Wang Changchun, Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Government, are preparing to welcome him.

<h3>Anti-Smuggling Movement Holds Propaganda Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Three Thousand Representatives from All Walks of Life Attended, Situation was Enthusiastic, Meeting Issued Declaration Denouncing Evils of Smuggling, Encouraging Citizens to Unite in Rejecting Smuggled Goods to Save the Nation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee, in order to awaken citizens to unite in refusing to buy or sell smuggled goods and to rescue the economic crisis, held a propaganda meeting and oath-taking ceremony at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 1:00 PM yesterday. Over three thousand representatives from all walks of life attended. The meeting issued a declaration denouncing the evils of smuggled goods, encouraging the nation to unite in refusing to buy smuggled goods to save the nation, and ordering stores to post slogans against buying or selling smuggled goods and radio stations to broadcast propaganda. The situation was extremely enthusiastic. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Details</p>
<p>The meeting's presidium included Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Qu Zhenhua, Jiang Manyun, Xu Xiaochu, Lin Kecong, Zhou Xuexiang, Huang Zaoxiong, Yu Zhenhui, Zhang Yichen, Liu Zhongying, and Lu Xingzhuang. After performing the rituals, Chairman Wang Xiaolai (represented by Cao Zhigong) delivered an opening speech. Then, Liu Zhongying led the reading of the "Oath Against Buying or Selling Smuggled Goods." Everyone raised their right hands and recited aloud, making the ceremony very solemn. After the oath was completed, Lin Kecong, Qu Zhenhua, and others gave speeches. There was also Liu Chunshan's satirical comedy and various smuggling skits. In addition, national goods manufacturers such as the China-France Pharmacy, Wuzhou Pharmacy, Taikang Company, Nanyang Tobacco Company, Kangyuan Canning Factory, and Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory distributed gifts, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai (represented by Cao) delivered an opening speech, stating that the various sectors of the city were saddened by the rampant smuggling. Since the anti-smuggling movement was initiated, all sectors of the country have responded enthusiastically, which is a very good phenomenon. The dumping of smuggled goods has a profound and significant impact on national tax revenue and the national economy. Its harm is no less than that of airplanes and cannons. People are wary of tangible aggression by airplanes and cannons, but the aggression of smuggled goods imperils the nation's lifeline imperceptibly. Therefore, if we want to revive the national economy and actively promote the national construction movement, we must reject smuggled goods nationwide to succeed. However, in the current situation, it is difficult to distinguish between smuggled and non-smuggled goods. Therefore, the best way to avoid the harm of smuggled goods is to consume domestic goods consistently. The association believes that refusing to buy or sell smuggled goods is an essential way to save the country. Therefore, it has convened a propaganda meeting, hoping that representatives from all walks of life will tell their friends and relatives to unite in refusing to buy or sell smuggled goods, thereby achieving the goal of refusing smuggled goods to save the country. This is what we hope for.</p>
<p>Speech Notes</p>
<p>Lin Kecong then gave a speech, stating that since the rise of smuggling, the resulting impact has directly destroyed our country's tariff system, and the national income has decreased accordingly. Last year alone, the estimated loss of tax revenue reached 200 million yuan. This is an astonishing figure. Indirectly, it is enough to disrupt the financial market, and the national economy has suffered greatly. To restore rights and revive the nation, everyone must work together, with one heart and one mind, to refuse to buy or sell smuggled goods, and not be greedy for small profits and lose big profits. Qu Zhenhua then gave a speech, stating that smuggling is a disguised form of economic aggression, which can control the life of the country and the nation, no less than airplanes and cannons. Taking only white sugar and rayon as examples, the customs duties collected have been reduced by half, and smuggled goods in North China are piled up like mountains and actively sold abroad. The facts are heartbreaking. To save the situation, the best way is to refuse to buy or sell smuggled goods. To truly achieve this, so that smuggled goods have no way out and are self-defeating, we must rely on each individual to set an example. He hoped that after everyone swore to refuse to buy or sell smuggled goods today, they would no longer blindly buy or sell smuggled goods and put themselves in a dead end.</p>
<p>Recreational Entertainment</p>
<p>There were also recreational performances by comedian Liu Chunshan and students from various schools, including ㊀ Acrobatics, (A) January 28th battle, (B) Yue Wang's Tomb, (C) January 28th Martyrs' Monument, (D) Never Forget National Humiliation, (E) New Life Movement logo, (F) Aviation to Save the Country, (G) Don't Be Discouraged, ㊁ National Goods Performance, ㊂ Singing, ㊃ Drama, ㊄ Liu Chunshan and other trendy comedies. In addition, stores, factories, companies, and firms posted slogans against buying or selling smuggled goods, major newspapers published commentaries, movie theaters showed advertisements warning against smuggling, and radio stations broadcasted speeches against the harms of smuggling.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Meeting</p>
<p>Since the Northeast Incident, the enemy has not only relied on violence to seize the Northeast, but has also instigated rogues to evade taxes and smuggle. The political and economic aggression has been carried out in tandem, and the harm is unprecedented. In recent days, the trend of smuggling has become increasingly rampant, spreading from North China to Central China and South China, from coastal ports to the interior. The poison of smuggled goods has spread throughout the country. In terms of national tax revenue, customs duties are the largest source of national revenue, and also the largest source of revenue in modern national finance. However, due to the impact of smuggling in our country, the estimated loss of tax revenue last year alone reached as much as 200 million yuan. If we combine the figures, it will be even more shocking. In terms of national industry and commerce, the losses suffered by the dumping of smuggled goods in recent years have been even more tragic. China is originally a country with underdeveloped industry. The fragile national industry depends on tariff protection to gradually develop. However, today the enemy is instigating smuggling, openly calling it "special trade," driving straight in and monopolizing the market. As a result, national industry and commerce have no way to struggle and are increasingly showing signs of collapse. In terms of the national economy, smuggled goods are devils that suck the marrow of our nation. We also know that our national economy is already in a difficult situation due to frequent severe disasters and internal and external troubles. The so-called national marrow has dried up to the last drop, and the purpose of the enemy's smuggling is to grab this last drop to satisfy its insatiable desire. In terms of smuggled goods in international relations, our country's tariffs have been undermined by the enemy and have lost their normality. Other countries with commercial interests in China will inevitably suffer losses. If we do not find a way to restore normalcy as soon as possible, it will encourage each country to seek its own interests and gradually lead to the disaster of economic partition. Negotiations between Britain and Japan are currently underway. Although the London authorities have repeatedly stated that they respect our country's sovereignty, the friction between Britain and Japan in the Far East commercial affairs has become increasingly acute in recent years, and each wants to adjust through negotiations. From this perspective, it is evident that the dumping of smuggled goods is the enemy's most ruthless means of carrying out economic aggression. If this continues without remedy, we will not only perish from the enemy's military force, but also from the enemy's smuggled goods. Fortunately, the anti-smuggling movement has risen with the demand for economic salvation and will soon be extended to the whole country. We hope that compatriots from all walks of life will act with conscience and unanimously reject smuggled goods, and strive to achieve the goal of thoroughly eliminating smuggled goods with a unified step. The country and the nation are deeply reliant on this. If unscrupulous merchants and shameless citizens still regard selling smuggled goods as a shortcut to getting rich and are willing to be enemies of the nation, then society will have its own due sanctions and will not be lenient in distinguishing between true and false. To those who want to be friends with our country, international trade emphasizes integrity. If they insist on going against the tide and disrupting the market by smuggling and destroying legitimate commerce, then the situation will be turbulent and resentment will deepen, which will be detrimental to others and may not be beneficial to themselves. We sincerely hope that they can change their plans and correct their mistakes to restore the normal track of international trade. This is what we especially hope for. This is our declaration.</p>

Attendees included Pan Gongzhan, Wang Weiming, Zhang Jintang, Su Gongwang, Liang Zhiping, Yang Yizhi, Zhang Tingrong, Chen Kecheng, and Zhou Guoping. Pan Gongzhan chaired the meeting, and Yang Yizhi served as the recorder. After formal greetings,</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Gongzhan Reported</p>
<p>He briefly stated that this year, July 7th is the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government. The municipal authorities have decided to hold five types of exhibitions in the city center from that day to the 18th of the same month, including industry, literature, safety, hygiene, and municipal administration, to celebrate. The Municipal Air Defense Association, to participate in the grand event, will also hold an air defense exhibition to express congratulations and promote air defense awareness. However, due to the small scale of the prepared air defense exhibition, it was feared that good results could not be achieved. The Military Affairs Commission was then telegraphed, requesting that all equipment from the National Mobile Air Defense Exhibition be transported to Shanghai for display to achieve completeness. This was approved. Now that the opening date is approaching, to expedite preparations, it has been decided to establish an air defense exhibition preparatory office to facilitate progress. Regarding the internal organization, in addition to the Municipal Government sending a letter to Commander Yang to serve as honorary chairman, the position of director will be held by the mayor himself, and I will serve as deputy director. Furthermore, the office will be divided into four groups: General Affairs, Propaganda, Explanation, and Security. The candidates for the group leaders have also been decided: Su Gongwang for General Affairs, Chen Kecheng for Propaganda, Zhang Jintang for Explanation, and Wang Weiming for Security. Each group will also have several sections to handle various preparatory matters. At the same time, the Military Affairs Commission has already sent Comrade Liang Zhiping to Shanghai today to guide all preparatory work. Now, I would like to invite Instructor Liang to first explain the content of the mobile air defense exhibition and the past exhibitions in various places for our reference.</p>
<p>Instructor Liang Reported</p>
<p>Instructor Liang then reported, briefly stating that the Military Affairs Commission's Air Defense Exhibition is very large in scale, and the exhibits are also very substantial. Its mission is extremely important. In the past, there were three periods when it set out to various places to hold exhibitions. The first period was in the cities of the upper Yangtze River basin, the second period was along the Longhai Railway line, and the third period was in the cities of the lower Yangtze River basin. This time in Shanghai is the fourth period. The duration of the previous exhibitions in various places ranged from one week to two weeks, depending on the situation in each place. The preparatory expenses required were borne by the local government and could be reimbursed based on actual expenses. The content of the air defense exhibition is divided into three parts: (1) Active Air Defense, which includes exhibits of aerial weapons and ground weapons; (2) Air Defense Intelligence, which is divided into several types, including intelligence, communication, and surveillance; and (3) Passive Air Defense, which focuses on protection designs, including anti-gas, disinfection, fire prevention, and rescue. In addition to equipment, there are many models, charts, and photographs in each part. In addition, there are also forty to fifty air defense films that can be distributed to various cinemas for public screening in the future. As for the preparatory work for the air defense exhibition, it is divided into three periods: preparation, layout, exhibition, and closing. The Military Affairs Commission has prepared a work plan for reference. Currently, special attention should be paid to propaganda work. Regarding the allocation of the budget, the General Affairs Group should account for 50%, the Propaganda Group 30%, and the remaining Explanation and Security Groups 10% each. When holding the opening ceremony, representatives from all sectors should be invited, and local schools, troops, militia, and staff of various agencies can be mobilized to participate. During the exhibition period, propaganda work such as oral lectures and costume parades can be carried out, and contact can be made with various newspapers to publish special issues. In short, propaganda work during the air defense exhibition should penetrate the people, arouse attention, and encourage everyone to visit in order to achieve great effectiveness.</p>
<p>Discussion and Resolution of Various Proposals</p>
<p>Then, the proposals were discussed. Proposal 1: From what date should the preparatory office of this association begin work? Please decide. Resolution: The preparatory office will begin work on June 24th. Office hours are set from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. All staff members must sign in on time. Proposal 2: How should the deputy group leaders, section chiefs, and staff of each section be decided? Resolution: (1) The candidates for deputy group leaders and section chiefs should be considered by Deputy Director Pan and the group leaders, and a list should be submitted to the mayor and director for decision, and the office will send separate letters to notify them. (2) The members of each section will be decided by the section chief in consultation with the group leader, and submitted to the General Affairs Group for distribution to various agencies.</p>
<p>(3) Transferring personnel will not receive a salary, but the preparatory office will provide food. 3. According to the regulations of the 10th Anniversary Commemorative Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Government, the principle of not selling tickets should be adopted. However, to maintain order at the venue, admission tickets will still be collected for management purposes. Deputy Director Pan is requested to negotiate with the 10th Anniversary Commemorative Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Government to make a final decision. 4. Instructor Liang proposed whether the association could hold an air defense exhibition lantern festival or a costume propaganda team for discussion. Resolution: The Propaganda Group will consider it. 5. Should airplanes be dispatched to circle the city and distribute leaflets when the association holds the opening ceremony? Please decide. Resolution: Airplanes can be dispatched to distribute leaflets. Submit a request to the Municipal Government for coordination.</p>
<p>Hope for Assistance from All Sectors</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the preparatory office, this air defense exhibition is very large in scale and is scheduled to open on July 7th. It is hoped that people from all walks of life in the local and foreign communities will come to visit. It will be possible to fully obtain various knowledge about air defense. Someone also said that the association's preparatory funds are very tight, and it is hoped that all sectors will provide assistance, donate air defense propaganda printed materials, or donate all related items on the layout of the exhibition hall. The association will welcome and accept them all.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories in Eastern and Western Shanghai Resume Work After Accepting Advice</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Adjudicates Compromise Measures, Five Factories Including Wanbao Wait for Mediation</p>
<p>Recently, workers in silk factories in the eastern and western districts of Shanghai went on strike successively due to the factories' failure to implement the compromise measures adjudicated by the Social Affairs Bureau and to assist arrested worker representatives. Yesterday, personnel were dispatched by party and government agencies to advise them, and they have successively resumed work. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Course of the Labor Unrest</p>
<p>Previously, silk weaving workers in the city went on strike to demand improved treatment. The Social Affairs Bureau adjudicated compromise measures and ordered both parties to comply. The workers complied and resumed work. However, the factories such as Meyer &amp; Company did not fulfill the conditions, so a few unscrupulous elements took the opportunity to instigate, causing disputes to arise again, and the situation became extremely serious. Although the party and government repeatedly dealt with it, it was endless. After final consultations, the party and government agencies decided to take severe measures and arrested more than 40 of the initiators of the strike one after another. At the same time, they ordered the factories to strictly comply with the conditions and resume work. However, workers in more than 50 factories in the eastern district, such as Baohua, and more than 10 factories in the western district, such as Tianying, went on strike again last week because the factories did not fulfill the conditions and to assist the arrested workers.</p>
<p>Advice to Resume Work</p>
<p>In order to eliminate the labor unrest, the party and government agencies and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions sent Lu Yinchu and Zhang Sheng from the Municipal Party Department, Wang Xianqing from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhou Xuexiang and Shao Xubai from the Federation of Trade Unions to various factories in eastern and western Shanghai to advise workers to resume work a few days ago. The workers have been advised and have successively resumed work on the previous two days. However, in the western district, Wanbao, Damei, Puyi, and Tongyi have dismissed three to more than ten workers each for four times. Baohua also plans to add night shifts, but the workers have not agreed, so mediation is still needed. The other factories in the eastern district have all resumed work as usual.</p>
<h3>People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Chen Xing and Bei Songsun: Chen Xing, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, and Bei Songsun, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, accompanied Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council and Chairman of the Bank of China, southward on the 15th to assist in reorganizing the financial affairs of Guangdong Province. Except for Mr. Song, who is still in Guangdong to meet with Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army, to discuss the reorganization of financial affairs in Guangxi Province, Mr. Chen and Mr. Bei have taken the Dollar Company's President Hoover steamer from Hong Kong and returned north first. According to the shipping company, the ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 4:00 PM today and berth at No. 11 and No. 12 pontoons. Senior officials from the two banks will welcome them at the ferry.</p>
<p>He Beiheng: Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, continued to send He Beiheng, General Manager of the Sichuan-Kang Colonization Bank, as a representative to the east. He first went to Lushan to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and arrived in Nanjing the day before yesterday. After meeting with Minister He of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, he left Nanjing for Shanghai on the 11:00 PM express train the night before yesterday because he still had to meet with Zhang Qun, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council. He arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 AM and stayed at the New Asia Hotel on Tianjin Road. He met with Mr. Zhang yesterday, hoping that Mr. Zhang could enter Sichuan. He will go to Nanjing again within a few days and return to Sichuan to report.</p>
<p>Liu Weizhang: Mr. Liu Weizhang, who previously represented Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army, and Deputy Commander Bai Chongxi, to the north, was appointed as a military investigation commissioner to Europe. He went to Nanjing from Shanghai a few days ago to handle departure procedures and bid farewell to the authorities. It is now known that Mr. Liu has completed his affairs in Nanjing and returned to Shanghai on the Capital Express train at 10:20 PM the night before yesterday. It is said that he will fly to Lushan within a few days to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to ask for instructions on everything, and then return to Shanghai to wait for the ship, which is scheduled to depart abroad in early next month.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bar Association Lays Foundation Stone for New Building</h3>
<p>Ceremony Held Yesterday Morning, People from All Walks of Life Attended</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association held a foundation stone laying ceremony for its new building at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route Belier at 10:00 AM yesterday. Those present included Zheng Yue, Chief Prosecutor of the Second Branch of the High Court, Lu Yimei, President of the District Court, Xu Zining of the First Special District Court, Mao Yun of the Municipal Party Department, Zhang Binghui of the Social Affairs Bureau, Lin Kecong of the Women's Association, Chen Riping of the Accountants Association, and members of the association's committee, Chen Tingrui, Yan Yinwu, Kuang AoKui, Zhou Xiaoan, Sun Zuji, Zhang Juansheng, Qu Yue, and Yin Yong, totaling more than one hundred people. Chairman Chen Tingrui reported on the construction process, stating that the association was established in the second year of the Republic of China and has been around for twenty-four years. Before the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, it had been renting houses for its offices. Because there were few members at that time, building an office was not necessary. It was not until the Shanghai Public Concession Mixed Court was recovered by the government and converted into a temporary court that the number of members increased sharply. Shanghai has always been the center of China's economy, culture, and transportation, and is related to international observation, so the construction of an office was established. However, due to a shortage of funds, a preparatory committee for the reorganization of the Shanghai Bar Association at that time first advocated the collection of a construction fund for new members. By the autumn season of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, a certain amount had been accumulated, and the current site of one acre, four fen, five li, and six hao was purchased. It was originally intended to start construction immediately, but because the savings had been exhausted and the land price had not been paid, it was not possible to hold a fundraising campaign until the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China. The Shanghai French Concession Mixed Court was recovered by our country and converted into the Second Special Court. The association's savings were sufficient for construction, and it was about to start construction. Unfortunately, the national crisis occurred, and Shanghai suffered the January 28 Incident, which caused delays. Until the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, a construction committee was organized to actively solicit drawings and start construction. The design was by Dingzhong Engineering Office, and the construction was by Qiye Construction Factory. Later, due to the death of a person in Qiye Factory, Xizhi Construction Factory was responsible for the construction. First, the association hired Jiang Changgeng, Zhang Jiguang, and the late Zhang Xiaoliang as honorary advisors. A three-story building with a cement and steel frame was built. The top floor is the assembly hall, the second floor is the library and clubhouse, and the first floor is the small assembly hall. The completion date is about November of this year. This is the construction process of the association, etc. After the report, Zheng Yue of the Second Branch of the High Court, Lu Yimei of the District Court, Mao Yun of the Municipal Party Department, Zhang Binghui of the Social Affairs Bureau, and others successively gave speeches. At the end, Chen Tingrui replied and held the foundation stone laying ceremony, took photos, and dispersed. It is also known that the first floor of the association building is sixteen feet high and has four offices, a stove room, a front bedroom, a bathroom, and a toilet. The first floor is fifteen feet high and has a library, a recreation room, a reading room, and a conference room. The second floor is seventeen feet high and has an assembly hall and lounge, a projection room, another bedroom, a servant's room, a bathroom, and a storage room. The toilet will cost a total of 139,700 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Shi Zhaoji, former Ambassador to the United States, flew from Shanghai to Lushan on the 23rd to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, report on his mission, and provide information on the international situation. He returned east to Nanjing on the 25th and visited Foreign Minister Wang. It is now known that Mr. Shi has completed his official duties in Nanjing and returned to Shanghai by train yesterday morning. He is still staying at the International Hotel on Jingan Temple Road. Currently, all parties in the local area are preparing to welcome him and invite Mr. Shi to speak. However, the joint banquet originally scheduled for the 30th by the International Problems Research Association and the Pacific Society has been postponed. Mr. Shi is scheduled to go to Qingdao for summer vacation next month after completing his social engagements in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Arrived in Shanghai to Bid Farewell to Yang Hucheng</h3>
<p>Yang Will Depart for the United States Tomorrow</p>
<p>Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, left Nanjing for Shanghai on the 11:00 PM express train the night before yesterday and arrived at the North Station at 7:00 AM yesterday morning. He returned to his private residence in Jingan Villa to rest and then met with Controller Yan Zhuang to hear about the investigation of the yarn trading turmoil. It is reported that Mr. Yu came here to bid farewell to Yang Hucheng, the former Director of the Xi'an Pacification Office, who is leaving the country. Mr. Yang visited him in the afternoon. More than 100 fellow Shaanxi natives from Nanjing and Shanghai, initiated by Mr. Yu, will hold a public banquet at the International Hotel on Jingan Temple Road at 12:00 noon today to bid farewell to Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang will depart for the United States tomorrow with Wang Linke, Kang Weike, Fan Yunong, and Yang's wife and son, a total of six people, on the Dollar Company's President Hoover steamer. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong this afternoon and set sail for the United States at 11:00 AM tomorrow morning. According to Secretary Kang Weike's conversation with a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, Mr. Yang will first go to the United States, passing through Japan without stopping. Mr. Yang has already visited Japan in the past. He plans to stay in the United States for two months. Although Mr. Yang is nominally a military investigation commissioner, he also wants to pay attention to agricultural and forestry water conservancy construction so that he can use the results of his investigation in the future as a reference for developing his hometown in the Northwest. Therefore, after landing in San Francisco, he plans to first investigate agricultural and forestry construction in the northwestern states of California, and then go to New York and Washington to investigate military and political affairs. Then he will cross the Atlantic to England and travel to various countries in Europe, including Germany and Italy. He will also go to Denmark to investigate agriculture and cooperative businesses. It will take one year to return home. Whether he needs to pass through the Soviet Union or take the Suez Canal is currently undecided.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Xi'an, 27th: Yang Hucheng is scheduled to depart on the 29th. Sun Weiru sent Du Bincheng, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, to fly to Shanghai on the Eurasia plane at 11:00 AM on the 27th to represent him in saying goodbye. Li Huchen, a member of the Military Senate, also flew to Shanghai on the same plane to see Yang off.</p>

<h3>Women's Groups Demand Participation in the Constitutional Declaration</h3>
<p>Various women's groups in the city jointly issued a declaration yesterday, demanding participation in the constitution-making process. It stated that convening a national assembly and formulating a national constitution in the current China is truly one of the great tasks of "saving the nation and preserving its existence," as stated in the declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee. In order to strengthen the power of "saving the nation and preserving its existence," there must be a good fundamental law, a constitution that truly represents the will of the entire people, to determine the fundamental rights and obligations of the people, to make the relationship between the people and the government, so that the people have sufficient "rights" and the government has sufficient "ability," to work together on the "great cause of nation-building." Therefore, constitution-making in the current China is indeed a work of great significance. Participating in the constitution-making of the National Assembly is undoubtedly the right and obligation of all citizens of the Republic of China. Of course, women, who account for half of the population, have the right to participate in constitution-making in the articles. However, the facts before us tell us that because of the low social status of women in general and the limited educational opportunities, they cannot compete with male compatriots in the election of national representatives. As a result, in the preliminary election, only a very few places and a very few women were elected as candidates. Whether they can be elected in the second election is still questionable. Therefore, in reality, we women are no different from being excluded from the doors of the National Assembly. As a result, we will only have the obligation to abide by the constitution, but not the right to participate in constitution-making. This will definitely not only affect the interests of women themselves, but also inevitably affect the interests of the entire nation and the country. In order to exercise the rights that citizens should have and fulfill the obligations that citizens should fulfill, and at the same time to save the country from peril and restore the glory of the nation, we women must demand to participate in the sacred work of constitution-making in the National Assembly like male citizens. If women, who account for half of the population, cannot actually have an appropriate number of representatives to participate in the National Assembly, as a result, the interests of half of the population cannot be fully guaranteed, and at the same time, the strength of half of the population cannot be fully developed. And the most unfortunate thing is that the first National Assembly of the Republic of China cannot become a truly shared assembly of all the people. What a shocking and unfortunate result this will be! We must fight for our due national rights and obligations, not only for our own interests, but also for the interests of the entire country and the entire nation. We clearly recognize that only we women can truly understand the pain of ourselves, and only by relying on our own strength can we relieve the pain of ourselves. Therefore, only if we can actually participate in the work of constitution-making, will the rights of us women in the constitution have a reliable guarantee, and the obligations of us women in the constitution will have the value of being observed. And only if we are closely united and strongly express the will and strength of our half of the population, can we win a truly glorious victory. Our women's participation in the constitution-making movement is one of the great movements to save the country and revive the nation. Therefore, we sincerely hope that male compatriots all over the country will support our movement. At the same time, we warmly hope that female compatriots all over the country will unite immediately and develop our movement quickly and widely. We must be determined and work together. Our future will surely have a bright future. Shanghai Women's Association, etc.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Literary and Art Circles Demand Destruction of "New Earth" Film, Condemning National Humiliation</h3>
<p>Over 140 Signatories in Declaration, Urging Government Ban on Screenings Nationwide</p>
<p>The East China News Agency reports: The blatant screening of the Japanese-German co-produced film "New Earth" in Shanghai is a demonstration and insult to the Chinese nation. Figures in literary and art circles are expressing their full indignation in demands to the Chinese government, accusations to the Japanese people, and protests to Japanese imperialists. Since the September 18th Incident, the four northeastern provinces have been openly seized and devoured by Japanese imperialists. Over 30 million compatriots in the four northeastern provinces are directly subjected to the trampling and slaughter of Japanese imperialists. For years, not only have compatriots in the four northeastern provinces sacrificed their lives, unyieldingly fighting Japanese imperialists, but all Chinese people, except for national traitors, have been united in striving for national liberation and the recovery of lost territories. This tidal wave of patriotic movement is precisely the manifestation of the sacred power of the Chinese nation in its struggle for survival in human history. This terrifies Japanese imperialists, who on the one hand falsely accuse it of being "anti-Japanese" and of being "bandits," and on the other hand attempt to ease the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Chinese people through so-called "cultural exchanges." However, facts have shattered this mask: "New Earth," which promotes the bandit policies of Japanese imperialism and insults the Chinese people, has been shown in Shanghai. Furthermore, there are unscrupulous Chinese newspapers publishing advertisements for it. Japanese imperialists are treating the four northeastern provinces, soaked with the blood of the Chinese people, as their blessed land, branding the faces of the Chinese people, especially those in the four northeastern provinces, with shame, and exposing the blood-drinking maw lurking behind their so-called "cultural exchanges." Since the September 18th Incident, literary and art figures have poured their efforts into engaging in the patriotic anti-Japanese struggle. They cannot but express their firm stance regarding this new challenge from Japanese imperialism using artistic means: First, the film company that produced "New Earth" and the cinema that screened "New Earth" should issue an apology to the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and guarantee that similar incidents will never occur again. Second, all copies of "New Earth" should be burned, and it should never be screened again, not only in Shanghai or anywhere in China, but also in Japan itself. Third, the Chinese government should not only be responsible for achieving the above two conditions, but must also call on the people of the whole country to carry out an anti-"New Earth" movement. Fourth, the people should impose strict moral sanctions on Chinese newspapers that have published advertisements for "New Earth." Fifth, the Chinese government should immediately grant the people freedom of patriotic assembly and association, freedom of speech and publication, and release all patriotic prisoners, in order to resist the cultural offensive of Japanese imperialism until the recovery of the four northeastern provinces. Literary and art figures, with the greatest determination, put forward the above demands and are willing to use all their strength to achieve them, hoping to receive a response from cultural circles and the people throughout the country. The signatories of the anti-"New Earth" declaration from literary and art circles include: Yu Fengfeng, Rong Zigang, Wang Renshu, Wang Luyan, Wang Jiyu, Yin Geng, Wen Ruo, Ba Jin, You Jing, Zi Lang, Yi Qun, Li Bo, Zi Wei, Bei Ou, Ai Qing, Ren Baige, Guang Shou, Xian Weiran, Ai Wu, Quan Zenghua, Liesi, Li Lei, Li Lan, Song Zhidi, Kefu, Wang Tiran, Wu Langxi, Wu Qingyou, He Jiahai, Xin Ren, Xin Lao, Di Geng, Shen Qiyu, Shen Siling, Du Junhui, A Ying, Sha Ting, Zhou Wen, Zhou Xuepu, Zhou Yang, Zhou Lengjia, Zhou Cai, Qi Zhou, Gang Ming, Wu Dinghe, Yu Tian, Meng Shi Huan, Dong Ping, Lin Danqiu, Lin Huanping, Lin Lin, Lin Na, Fei Chang, Jin Yang, Jin Manhui, Jin Weiyao, Shao Zinan, Shao Zonghan, Ya Ding, Ji Hong, Yao Ke, Hu Feng, Hu Lanqi, Hu Yifan, and over 140 others.</p>
<h3>Husband's Quarrel Reaches Outside, Police Discover Opium Den</h3>
<p>Case Transferred to Shanghai Police Bureau for Investigation</p>
<p>Wu Zhuquan (also known as Xiao Zhuquan), a local resident residing at No. 451 Tangqiao Road, Pudong, was quarreling with his wife at home last night at 9:00 PM. The sound of their argument reached outside, and a police chief from the Tangqiao Police Station, leading a patrol team, heard the noise and suspected a fight. They entered the house to investigate, but unexpectedly discovered six people inside smoking opium. The policemen immediately took all six opium smokers, including Gu Maomao, Xi Zhaosheng, and Wu Zhuquan, to the police station. The case involves violating the opium prohibition, and there is suspicion that they are using opium cessation permits as a cover for an opium den. The case was transferred to the Fourth Division of the Shanghai Police Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Fraud Case Involving Impersonation of Detective Adjourned for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Extorting Over 100 Yuan from Owner of Tai'an Inn, Suspect Arrested by French Police</p>
<p>Hua Rongchang, a Tianjin native who runs a "tiger stove" (hot water service) upstairs at the Zhonghe Tang Chinese medicine store on Avenue Joffre (present-day Middle Huaihai Road) in the French Concession, previously served as a Chinese detective for the French police. However, he was dismissed for misconduct. Hua, exploiting his stout and tall physique, which resembled the appearance of a "bao kong" (police inspector), frequently used this to intimidate and extort money from people. Recently, Hua and his gang, posing as detectives, went to the owner of the Tai'an Inn on Minquan Road, accusing the inn of allowing guests to smoke opium and running a brothel. They came to search the place and used handcuffs to restrain the innkeeper, surnamed Xiao, demanding 500 yuan. They eventually extorted 105 yuan. The French police learned of this, dispatched detectives, and arrested Hua Rongchang. It was discovered that he had committed a similar crime in the Public Concession last year, for which he was arrested and prosecuted by the First Special District Court. He was sent to the Second Special District Court for trial and detention. After the investigation was completed, the police department prosecuted him for the crime of extortion. The details have been previously reported in this newspaper. The other day, Judge Chen Shuoying continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. Hua denied the accusations and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend him and present counter-evidence. The court questioned the owner, the accountant, the waiter, and the witnesses presented by the defendant. After hearing the arguments, the court adjourned the session, and sentencing will be announced at a later date. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Abortion Case Involving Female Doctor to Be Retried with More Witnesses</h3>
<p>Cheng Liwei, a Guangdong woman who runs a hospital at No. 235 Feizi Road, and also works as a doctor, performed an abortion on Wang Ye of the same native place on June 9, 1930. Due to an unsuccessful procedure, Wang Ye was injured and died. Cheng fled to another city. Recently, she came to Shanghai and hid in Room 261 of the Dadong Hotel on Nanjing Road. The case was discovered, and Hongkou Police detectives Zhang Faxiang and Zhang Desheng arrested her and sent her to the First Special District Court for trial and detention. The other day, Judge Dai Rongduo opened the Third Criminal Court for trial. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu changed his plea in the middle of the proceedings. He stated that in June of 1930, Wang was injured and died after the defendant performed an abortion on her. The defendant once defended herself at the court, and then fled. The police issued a warrant for her arrest. The defendant claimed to the police that Wang came to her clinic for treatment, complaining of abdominal pain, dizziness, coughing, and uterine inflammation with black discharge. They agreed on a fee of 6.2 yuan for outpatient treatment. After medication, the black discharge stopped. She had seen another doctor before visiting the defendant, and sought medical attention elsewhere. After Wang died, there was an attempt to settle the matter with 3,000 yuan. At the time, a telegram arrived from Guangdong asking her to return home, so she left immediately, first going to Nanjing and then returning to Guangdong. Recently, she has also been practicing medicine in Nanjing and has been to Shanghai several times. At that time, a person named Chen Fu, residing at No. 117 Bazhi Road (now No. 279), who may have been the husband of the deceased, reported the case to the police. This person has disappeared since the January 28th Incident. Wang Xianbi, the deceased's nephew, who studied at the Yokohama Overseas Chinese School on North Sichuan Road, claimed that the deceased was his aunt. On June 9th, he went to the defendant's hospital to pay the abortion fee of 100 yuan. She gave her an injection and medicine, saying it was safe. He went to the hospital again the next day, and the defendant treated her again on the third day, saying she was fine. At that time, the deceased entrusted him with a love letter and a pair of English letters, and the defendant also sent him a letter saying, "To Mr. Shili: I have been treating your aunt's illness from beginning to end. Why ask another doctor? I will not be responsible after that." This letter was also kept by the police and presented. The nephew cannot be found now.

<p>Life Ahead Seemed Bleak, Leaving Abandoned Infant</p>

<h3>Pregnant Woman Attempts Suicide in Huangpu River, Rescued</h3>
<p>Heartbroken Over Lover's Suicide, Seeks Death in Pursuit, Conflicting Testimony to Police Suggests Concealment</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:00 AM, a young woman wearing a striped silk qipao and sneakers suddenly appeared at the French Company Wharf on the Bund. She was only about twenty years old. She hired a Ningbo boatman named Dai Fugui's No. 90 boat, pretending to want to go to Pudong. The boatman noticed her sad expression and was on alert. When they were in the middle of the river, the woman suddenly ordered him to go south and then abruptly wanted to go north. At that moment, she suddenly stood up and attempted to throw herself into the water. Fortunately, the boatman stopped her and urgently reported the incident to the water patrol police, who brought her back to the police station. She claimed her name was Xu Xinwan, 21 years old, from Pinghu, and she was studying at a girls' middle school on Hart Road in the Public Concession. The reason for her suicide was the suicide of her lover. She had studied at a normal school in Jiaxing three years ago and fell in love with a male student surnamed Zhang. His parents had arranged a marriage for him and strongly opposed their relationship to avoid hindering the wedding. Recently, she received an urgent letter saying that Zhang had privately consumed sleeping pills and died, so she was heartbroken and wanted to follow him in death. However, when detective Zhu Yaoshan and Shi Aqin asked her to write her name in pencil, she wrote "Xu Xinzhu," which was different from her previous name, Xu Xinwan. The handwriting was also very crooked, like that of a primary school student. When asked about the girls' middle school on Hart Road, she pointed east and said west, giving conflicting testimony. When asked if she had any relatives in Shanghai, she claimed to have only one sister living in the Wang Concession. The detectives took her to the address, but a woman surnamed Wang only acknowledged knowing her and did not recognize her as her sister. However, she and Miss Xu had worked as maids together at the Su family's residence on Seymour Road, and the woman claimed her real name was Abao. The detectives took her back to the police station. The police noticed that the woman's abdomen was swollen, as if she were four or five months pregnant. Suspecting she was concealing something, they decided to send her to the local court for disposition.</p>

At 10:00 PM, she was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Doctors determined that Shao suffered from acute opium poisoning in addition to her illness. Treatment was ineffective, and she died at 2:00 AM that night. Due to the poisoning, the hospital reported the case to the French police as required. The police sent detectives to investigate and transported the body to the Tongren Supplementary Yuan branch morgue for examination. The case will be reported to the Special District Court today for inspection.</p>

On the morning of the 17th of this month, a man named Gui Xu pretended to be attending a wedding and lured Shunkang to Shanghai. He hid the child in Shen Ke's home at No. 106 Jinning Road, Hongkou, and sent a threatening letter, demanding a large ransom. Gui sent someone to negotiate, but without success. Gui Xu temporarily placed Shunkang at the home of a Pang family at No. 16 Xingyi Lane, South Caojiazhai, Caogjiadu on the 23rd. However, Shunkang's crying aroused Pang's suspicion, and after questioning him, he reported the incident to the Caogjiadu Police Station. Upon receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched a police officer and arrested Gui Xu. Shunkang and the reporter were also taken to the police station for questioning. Gui Xu confessed to having an accomplice named Shen Ke. The police station immediately dispatched Detective Captain Zhang Zhongde and squad leader Tang Bingxiang to the location, assisted by the Yulin Road Police Station. Shen Ke was arrested and temporarily detained at the police station. After returning to the station and reporting the incident, Gui Luchen was notified to come to Shanghai to take his son home.

<h3>Fashionably Dressed Female Passenger Jumps into Sea from "Xinjiang" Steamer</h3>
<p>A Pretty Woman in Her Early Twenties Jumps Overboard off Tongsha, Cause of Death Unknown</p>
<p>A young female passenger committed suicide by jumping into the sea from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Xinjiang" steamer, which was en route to Ningbo on the afternoon of the 24th. The details were recorded by a reporter from the Datong News Agency as follows:</p>
<p>Fashionable Attire</p>
<p>The "Xinjiang" steamer departed from the Bund at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 24th, bound for Ningbo. A female passenger was aboard in Cabin No. 14 on the third floor. The woman was in her early twenties, with a round face and permed hair. She was quite pretty and wore a small black floral silk qipao and yellow square-toed, openwork leather shoes. Her attire was very fashionable.</p>
<p>Calm Demeanor</p>
<p>At around 6:00 PM that evening, the ship left the Wusong estuary. As the steamer started serving dinner, Yu Fang, the steward, delivered dinner to the female passenger. She ate almost a full meal, showing no signs of wanting to end her life. After dinner, she sat alone on a long bench outside the cabin door, as if enjoying the breeze. Little did anyone know that she had already planned to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Jumps into the Sea</p>
<p>When no one was paying attention, the female passenger secretly untied two ropes securing the tarpaulin on the ship's railing, preparing to jump overboard. At 8:30 PM that evening, when the ship was off the coast of Tongsha, the female passenger opened the tarpaulin and jumped into the sea. Someone saw her and cried for help. The ship immediately stopped and searched the area, but she was nowhere to be found. Because there was no suicide note, the woman's name and the cause of her suicide are unknown.</p>
<h3>Gong Linlang Unwilling to be a Concubine, Accuses Husband of Bigamy</h3>
<p>Her husband's legal wife recently searched for him, leading to a secret encounter with Gong and the exposure of the affair.</p>
<p>Li Qianqiu, a Hunan native in his late forties, operates the Fuyuan Hotel at No. 1, Lane 7, Baoshan Road, Qujiang Road, Zhabei. He already had a wife at home, but although his wife had given birth to several children, none survived. Now his wife is old and has no hope of having more children. He felt the sorrow of lacking an heir, and also felt that achieving high status was becoming more difficult. Therefore, in August of the 20th year of the Republic of China, through acquaintances Lu Shiqing and Li Huanwen, he found Gong Linlang, a young girl from Chongming who was at a marriageable age and had a certain charm, a daughter of a modest family. He falsely claimed that he was taking a new wife as a replacement for his deceased wife, and boasted about his wealth, making her the proprietress. Because the woman was satisfied, they held a traditional wedding ceremony on August 24 of the same year at Li's Yishun Wine Shop on Wusong Road. After the marriage, the love between the old husband and young wife did not diminish. The woman was unaware that Li already had a wife. Unexpectedly, on the 2nd of this month, Li's legal wife, Li Yuan, suddenly came to the Fuyuan Hotel to look for her husband, encountered Gong Linlang, and they argued over who was the proprietress, exposing the secret of several years in a single day. Gong Linlang was furious to learn that her master already had a wife, unwilling to be a mere concubine. She then hired lawyer Shi Youfu to file a complaint with the District Court Prosecutor's Office, accusing Li Qianqiu of bigamy. After prosecutor Li Fen's investigation confirmed the facts, he filed a public prosecution for the crime under Section 1 of Article 237 of the Criminal Law. The criminal court is scheduled to publicly pronounce judgment today.</p>
<h3>Xie Xiaochu Resigns as Manager of Huafeng Company</h3>

<h3>Boiler Explosion Kills Worker</h3>
<p>Chen Yusheng, a 24-year-old from Changzhou, was a worker at the Yongan Yarn Factory on Xihu Road, Yangshupu. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, a leak was discovered on the cylinder of the factory's boiler. Factory staff dispatched Chen Yusheng and four other workers to repair it. During the repair, the cylinder suddenly exploded. Three workers fled upon seeing this, but Chen Yusheng was too slow to escape and was scalded all over by the boiling water that erupted from the machine, dying instantly.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Ships on Yangtze and Coastal Routes</h3>
<p>Since the surge in steel prices in March and April of this year, the value of ships has also increased. Subsequently, no fewer than fourteen ships with a tonnage of five to seven thousand tons have been purchased in this port, with a total value of 4.8 million yuan. This huge demand for tonnage is due to the extreme shortage of ships on China's Yangtze River and coastal routes. The reason for the price increase is the result of the global situation. Countries around the world are currently seeking to expand their military preparations, and all scrap iron and steel materials are the main raw materials for military needs, so their prices have increased by 50% compared to two months ago. It is reported that the aforementioned ships will be delivered to Chinese and foreign shipping companies in this port separately by various parties in Europe, America, and Japan. The distribution is five ships for foreign merchants (three of which were purchased from Japan) and nine ships for Chinese merchants, with a total tonnage of 82,000 tons. Since the beginning of the year, the demand for old ships has also continued to increase, especially the purchasing desire of Japan. Japan has also exempted the import tax on scrap metal and imports large quantities of scrap iron and steel materials from San Francisco and other Pacific coastal ports in the United States. The United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries have similarly raised the price of scrap iron due to the large use of armaments. The competition among world shipping companies has reached an unprecedented level, which is also one of the reasons for the soaring value of ships.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Brewery to Resume Work This Morning</h3>
<p>The labor strike at the British-owned Shanghai Brewery on Siyi Road, Yichang Road in this port, which had been deadlocked for many days, was resolved yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM after representatives of the party and government agencies negotiated with the factory owner and agreed on a compromise. All workers will resume work this morning and then negotiate the eight conditions proposed by the workers. The details are as follows, as explored by a reporter from the Huadong News Agency:</p>
<h3>Party and Government Mediation</h3>
<p>All 175 striking workers at the factory made a final large-scale petition to the Social Bureau the day before yesterday, requesting the authorities to stop the police from arresting workers and negotiate with the factory to resume work immediately. The Social Bureau believed that this labor strike had been unresolved for a long time, which not only affected public order but also was not good for the workers. Therefore, it specially dispatched Commissioner Zhang Chuqiang, together with Cao Peizi, a representative from the Municipal Party Department, to the factory at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss a solution with the factory manager, Yi Hekesheng, and the general manager of Zhouyong Road, Hai Gao. After three hours of negotiation, it was finally agreed that the striking workers would be allowed to resume work today. The eight conditions that were proposed will be discussed in detail after the resumption of work.</p>
<h3>Resuming Work This Morning</h3>
<p>After the representatives of the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau, Cao and Zhang, discussed the principles with the factory, they immediately returned to the striking workers. After being educated by the four representatives, Lu Shiting, Tian Arong, Ji Mingzhou, and Fu Rongsheng, who were elected by all the workers, they accepted the persuasion of the party and government and decided to enter the factory for work at 7:00 AM this morning. At this point, the labor strike came to an end. All the newly recruited White Russians and female workers hired by the factory will also be dismissed by the factory this morning.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industries Contribute Opinions on Levy of Inheritance Tax</h3>
<p>Should be divided into total and partial taxes, with a starting amount of 10,000 yuan</p>
<p>The Silver and Money Industries Association has submitted the issue of collecting inheritance tax to the Income Tax Subcommittee of the Two Industries Research Institute for research. After the subcommittee formulated specific opinions, it was passed by the executive committee of the association and jointly submitted to the Legislative Yuan by the two associations, contributing opinions and hoping to be adopted. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Silver and Money Industries yesterday that the two associations unanimously agree on the principle of collecting inheritance tax because inheritance tax is a direct national tax that has been implemented in various European and American countries and can help promote social production and control private economy. The method of collection should be divided into total inheritance tax and partial inheritance tax. The principle of inheritance tax determined by the Central Political Conference only levies total inheritance tax and not partial inheritance tax. When collecting, a lower tax rate should be set for the total inheritance tax first, and the tax rate for partial inheritance tax should be determined according to the relationship. Donations to education, culture, charity, and public welfare undertakings should be exempted from inheritance tax to encourage people to enthusiastically donate. The levy amount should be increased from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. At the beginning of the levy, the government should strive to be lenient to reduce people's pain.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Presents to Party and Government Agencies to Strengthen Guild Organization</h3>
<p>Resolutely prevent division</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce presented to the Central People's Training Department, the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, and the Municipal Social Bureau regarding the matter of strengthening the guild organization and prohibiting division. The presentation was made for the matter of applying on June 19 to convene the eighth general membership meeting. According to the joint signatures of the members, the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Guild, the Rice Shop Industry Guild, and the Knitting Industry Guild, it was proposed to request the party and government agencies at all levels to strengthen the merchant group organization and absolutely prohibit division. The proposal stated, "The organization of the same industry, the industry guild, was originally intended to concentrate the strength of the same industry to seek the development of business. Therefore, the Industry Guild Law stipulates that a guild should be established in the same area, limited to one guild, so as to prevent the division of the organization. The law is good and the intention is beautiful. However, some merchants, accustomed to the concept of helpers, or due to temporary disputes, often submit resignations and request permission to form groups. As a result, there are now more than 400 industry guilds in this city. Within a year, the number of new guilds increased by a large amount. This makes people feel that merchants and commerce are not prosperous and guilds are not thriving. However, in practice, the arbitrary establishment of this kind of redundant organization has caused opposition and disputes among the same industry. It is often seen in the newspapers that they attack and criticize each other endlessly. The original guild is restricted, and the guild affairs cannot be carried out in a healthy way. The newly established divided organizations also become institutions of mutual struggle due to talent and economic relations, failing to take care of guild affairs. Is this the blessing of the same industry? At this time when we are gathering the national strength and controlling the industry to seek revival, how can we in industry and commerce go against the trend and divide our strength? Therefore, we have proposed to the general meeting to discuss measures to prevent this division. We propose that the Central Party Department, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the party and government agencies in this city should resolutely prevent the division of organizations of similar business nature so as to ensure the health of the industry guild. Please make a decision, etc." After the general meeting discussed the matter, it was unanimously agreed that each industry's manpower and resources are limited. If we only focus on creating names, then manpower will be scattered and resources will be thin. The best case is that the form is preserved but there is no practical benefit. The worst case is that they restrain each other and cause increasing disputes. Although the law restricts each region to only allow the establishment of one branch, the classification of business is not clearly stipulated by law. There is a lot of room for free adjustment, so it is often the case that in each general category of business, another category is analyzed at any time and place as a reason for separate establishment. The trend is becoming more and more obvious. There are many guild names, but the strength is becoming weaker and weaker. It is necessary to correct this as soon as possible. It was decided to separately present to the central and municipal party and government agencies to prevent the division of organizations. The case has been recorded and prepared for presentation to your department (yuan) (association) (bureau) for review and approval for implementation, which is convenient for the public.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Conscience and Determination</h3>
<p>— Shen Qian</p>
<p>Upon seeing the news that four Chinese sailors on the Japanese vessel Heimaruyama, "after discovering that the vessel had been smuggling for over a year, motivated by righteous indignation, took advantage of the vessel's passage through Chinese territorial waters near Qinhuangdao to seize control of the person overseeing the smuggled goods, temporarily redirecting the vessel towards Yantai. It arrived in Yantai on the 22nd, and the Yantai East Sea Customs confiscated all of the smuggled goods" (see yesterday's Jinan dispatch in this newspaper), I believe everyone's heart was gladdened, and everyone felt nothing but the utmost respect for these four heroic and courageous individuals. From this dramatic and heroic action, we have proven not only that the sailors, a class often looked down upon by scholars and officials, "dare to be second to none in loving their country," but also that their love for their country exceeds that of the self-serving scholars and officials. Once they are motivated by righteous indignation, they not only disregard their own professions, but also risk their lives, daring to confront the smuggling pirates with the minuscule strength of four people! This righteous act is not only the glory of these four courageous heroes, but also the glory of all Chinese sailors!</p>
<p>Now, as a result of this courageous act, the Japanese have already dispatched a warship to Yantai to demonstrate their power, and are even demanding the "extradition of these Chinese sailors" in a bullying manner. It seems that they are once again going to play the trick of feigning panic in the hopes of escalating the situation. If this is indeed the case, then other than preparing ourselves to shed blood in defense of our nation and justice, quietly awaiting developments, there is truly no second option.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, on the same day that this news reached the readers, the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Smuggling Movement was holding an expanded propaganda meeting. In order to make people understand the dangers of smuggling and to expand propaganda, it is very important. However, this expanded propaganda meeting was not actually "large" enough. The location was limited to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Auditorium, which was not only too small in capacity, but also limited by working hours, etc. The general public may not be able to attend and participate, not to mention the more remote worker areas, where, due to illiteracy and not reading newspapers, people probably don't even know about this event.</p>
<p>Therefore, one can't help but think of using the most popular and closest-to-the-masses educational tools, such as storytelling ballads, etc., to awaken the masses and instill the idea of not buying and selling smuggled goods and not being traitors. According to the "Taiyuan Dispatch" in this newspaper's weekly supplement published yesterday, Taiyuan is now vigorously implementing the "National Salvation Ballad Movement," and the results are very good. Those who were initially hesitant are now clamoring to join in learning. "In everyday performances, the audience requests the national salvation ballads the most." This is not without precedent in Shanghai. For example, wasn't "Capturing XX Persons Alive" all the rage in Shanghai's various amusement parks for a while? And according to other magazines, such as "Guangming" and "Drama Era," in Taiyuan, not only are "ballads" taking on the responsibility of national salvation, but other performances are also using new content to participate in the work of national salvation.</p>
<p>Similarly, if we use these most popular arts that are closest to the masses to awaken the masses not to buy or sell smuggled goods and not to be traitors, the effectiveness will definitely be great.</p>
<p>Of course, this is only to achieve peace of mind for our "conscience," and this is only the work of awakening the "conscience" of our compatriots. However, under the enemy's military, cultural, and political-economic aggression, relying solely on "conscience" is really not enough to prevent our being infringed upon. For example, smuggling has the armed protection of shameless pirates and the disguise of internal traitors, so that those who originally did not want to buy or sell smuggled goods find it difficult to see its true face after it has been disguised, and the result is still being deceived. What's more, in addition to soft deception, there is also hard deception. Like the Heimaruyama incident, what follows is a warship!</p>
<p>Therefore, relying solely on "conscience" is not enough. Following "conscience," we must also dare to have a bloody "determination"! This determination should not only be possessed by a few individuals, but should also be unanimously possessed by the entire nation.</p>
<p>And to awaken everyone's "conscience" and "determination," a truly expanded propaganda effort should be launched without delay.</p>
<h3>Xiang Ming</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>I met Xiang Ming when I was quite young and didn't understand much. I was living with my uncle in a large city in Henan Province at the time. The Northern Expeditionary Army had just arrived there, and my uncle had come with the army.</p>
<p>We lived together. I went to school during the day and returned in the evening. Whenever I came home, there were always many people in the house, all wearing grey clothes: they were my uncle's colleagues.</p>
<p>Although gambling was clearly prohibited at that time, unless they were on duty and couldn't go to work, they would always play eight rounds of mahjong every night.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I hated gambling from a young age, no matter what kind of cards or betting it was, I hated it. When they were there shuffling the tiles or shouting "tong," "he," or "wan," I always felt very sad, had a headache, couldn't study, and would sit in the courtyard in a fit of anger. Although my uncle knew about my bad temper, he couldn't stop his friends from playing, or going somewhere else to play, sometimes! He would even scold me: "You're not even grown up yet, but you've got quite the temper!"</p>
<p>One day, one of my uncle's colleagues came over. He was very young, very tall, with a large Shandong man's face, and a loud voice, stronger than our physical education teacher. He was very strange, like me he didn't like playing mahjong.</p>
<p>He was Xiang Ming.</p>
<p>That day, everyone got together again, and started shuffling the tiles noisily. Only Xiang Ming didn't participate, he didn't even look at it, but ran over to watch me do arithmetic.</p>
<p>As soon as he stood behind me, people on the other side started shouting:</p>
<p>"Old Second, come on!"</p>
<p>"I hate playing mahjong!"</p>
<p>"Good heavens," one person said, "it sounds so nice coming from him! Do you know that disobeying the majority is being a reactionary, a warlord's lackey, an imperial..."</p>
<p>"Stop it!" Xiang Ming turned around and said to the giggling person, "You only know a few names. But… if you get caught playing mahjong by the headquarters..."</p>
<p>I heard him say a lot of things, something about "revolution," "the masses," "youth," "spirit," I didn't understand any of it. However, I understood his opposition to playing mahjong.</p>
<p>I happily talked with him, he helped me draw formulas, and told many interesting stories. He was an interesting, happy person. Later, I learned that he was known as a revolutionary model, brave and enthusiastic, living under the arrest of warlords since he was young, until the Northern Expeditionary Army arrived, he was able to operate openly.</p>
<p>However, when my uncles talked about him, they always said:</p>
<p>"Too young, still hasn't lost his childishness..."</p>
<p>I didn't care if he was childish or old, as long as I could talk to him, I would be with him. So, I became good friends with him. He often came, sometimes bringing a lot of things. However, one day, I heard that he had been transferred away, and I couldn't see him, I was very lonely. I have been lonely ever since. I often remember him.</p>
<p>This winter, I returned home from Beiping and ran into him at the station. He seemed to have shrunk after running around for a few years, his height seemed very short, wrapped in a leather overcoat, his voice was a little shaky in the north wind, not loud at all.</p>
<p>As soon as we met, I was very happy, gripped his hand tightly, and couldn't speak. Finally, I remembered his temper:</p>
<p>"Do you still play mahjong now?"</p>
<p>"No need to talk about that," he said in a Beiping accent, "I do everything, eating, drinking, whoring, gambling, bragging, everything!"</p>
<p>I looked at his face, it was pale.</p>
<p>"You've grown taller, how are your university studies going?" I told him there was one semester left, and he finished the thought, "You young people have hope, have hope, last year I saw your name in the newspaper as a cadre educating the country..." As he spoke, he looked at his watch: "I have to go, the car is coming."</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<p>He waved his hand, didn't say anything, and left. I stared blankly at him, not knowing what to say.</p>

<h3>Sword Bean</h3>
<p>— Wu Zanfang</p>
<p>When curved peaches come on the market, a bowl of sword beans is added to our meals. Because its shape resembles a knife, people generally call it sword bean. But in our countryside, it is called "April Knot" because it bears fruit in the fourth month of the lunar calendar. If you call it sword bean to our fellow villagers, no one will know what you mean.</p>
<p>Almost every family in my hometown has a vegetable garden. The vegetables we eat are grown in our own vegetable garden. Unlike city dwellers who have to buy everything, and it's not fresh. Looking at this bowl of sword beans on the table, I can't help but think of the "April Knots" under the melon sheds and bean trellises in my hometown's vegetable garden.</p>
<p>What a joyful memory! Like a little bird, following my mother back and forth, or carrying a small blue basket for her, jumping and skipping to the vegetable garden to pick fresh vegetables. Cucumbers—red amaranth—in order, pick the bigger ones to take. When we walked under the bean trellis, the surprising thing was seeing the newly grown "April Knots." They were so green and tender that, if you weren't careful, your long fingernails would break them and some white sap would come out. My mother told me that stir-fried tender "April Knots" with sliced meat was the best vegetable. This sentence almost earned my drool, but I didn't let it drip down, I still swallowed it secretly. When the basket was full, my mother told me to hurry to school and eat the freshly cooked vegetables at lunchtime.</p>
<p>After school at noon, I would rush in the door, shouting, and sure enough, there was already a bowl of steaming fresh "April Knot" stir-fried with sliced meat on the table. My mother smiled and tapped the edge of the bowl with her bamboo chopsticks and said, "Come, come and taste the new season's food! Eat it and study hard." Under my mother's encouragement and delight, I ate half a bowl more rice than usual. Perhaps it was the new "April Knots" that increased my appetite!</p>
<p>After that, my golden sweet dream was quickly torn apart, and now there is only an empty trace left. When I pick up a chopstick of sword beans and put it in my mouth, I will relive the distant childhood memories. But how vague and distant it is! Where can I go to find a grain of sand from my childhood? I can only stare at the bowl of sword beans and sink into a state of silent thought.</p>
<h3>Summer Sketches</h3>
<p>— Lin Jia</p>
<p>One, Afternoon Nap</p>
<p>In summer, our feeling is pleasant, a little bit of anesthesia in the excitement, that slight breeze blows in the face, blowing the fragrance of flowers and plants, all kinds of wildflowers in the field, vying for beauty are painted with beautiful colors, the sunlight shoots into the water, flipping brilliant golden light, making people want to daydream, occasionally a white cloud, changing from the blue sky rapidly drawn past, the ground also left a shadow of a runaway wild horse galloping away,</p>
<p>At noon, don't miss the opportunity to take a nap. Quietly move the cool bed to the green willow embankment where the breeze is blowing, there is intermittent cicada song in the treetops, feet, down facing the slow flow of water, beside you put a palm fan and a volume of lyric selections, chanting to unknowingly fall asleep.</p>
<p>The time for a nap should not be too long, but if you are sleeping sweetly, suddenly being woken up, or being startled by the rain, that kind of soft, unfinished sleepiness is like a stringed instrument playing to a tense moment, suddenly interrupted, the sound stops, but the aftersound remains, extremely mournful.</p>
<p>Two, Rain</p>
<p>Summer rain, unlike the plum rain season or autumn rain, is not so easy to arouse people's melancholy. In spring and autumn, to appreciate the rain, it is best to open the window or put on a raincoat and slowly stroll to the countryside. The rain falls so evenly. So bland and poetic,</p>
<p>Summer cannot be appreciated in this way, summer rain is rapid, often the sky is as clear as the sea, suddenly a layer of thick clouds surges up, a few muffled thunders, rain drops the size of beans, rain lines as thick as ropes, then people are taught to avoid the goods basin flying down, at this time you close the window tightly, listening to the rain drops hitting the tiles with a rustling sound, and the eaves water falling to the ground "Di Ta", like a raging torrent, rushing. However, after a while, the rain clears and the sky clears, and the fire-like sun still shines brightly on the earth.</p>
<p>Some people say that spring is a maiden in her boudoir, then summer is like a passionate bride, the maiden sometimes has unspeakable grievances, but the bride is exactly proud and charming.</p>
