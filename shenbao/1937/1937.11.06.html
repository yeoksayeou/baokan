<h3>九國公約會議遭遇困難我代表一度表示退席</h3>
<p>主席所擬對日覆文措辭欠妥未通過　昨兩次會議僅商定原則今日再討論</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　九國公約會議頃於午前十時四十分舉行非公開會議、首由墨西哥代表法倍拉發言、力陳履行國際義務之必要、次由中國首席代表顧維鈞博士發言、謂中國出席會議、倘足妨碍致日本復文之討論、則中國代表團凖備暫時不出席會議、但對於會議所决定之一切、則當完全保留、至是、主席比國外長斯巴克勸中國代表團仍行出席會議、中國代表始加以允從、斯巴克遂乃宣讀致日本政府復文草案、宣讀旣畢、蘇聯代表李維諾夫宣稱該復文草案最好先分送各國代表團研究、然後提出討論、於是會議乃於十一點三十分延會、以便各國代表團分別審査、而定於正午十二點賡續開會、（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　九國公約會議於午前十一時半延會之後、又於午刻賡續舉行非公開會議、至午後一時十五分而畢、並定於明日上午十一時續行開會、據負責人士所悉、各國代表團曾以對日復文草案之修正文送交九國公約會議秘書處、至於指派人數較少之委員會與日本進行談判一層、則當俟接得日本覆文之後、方可决定、九國公約會議又發表公報稱、‘本月四日及五日迭次舉行全體會議、當經討論對於日本政府答覆比國邀請之照會、應由九國公約會議予以答覆、覆文各項原則、業經會議加以通過、惟關於覆文措辭、則現正由各國代表進行文換意見’云、（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　今晨九國公約會議開會時、主席比國外長斯巴克、當卽提出渠所草致日本政府之復文、內容包含三點、卽㊀日本對於邀請參加九國公約會議一事所提出之覆文、承認九國公約仍屬有效、査九國公約第一條、曾就中國領十完整與政治獨立、有所規定、然則日本對於與九國公約條文相符合之九國公約會議、自不應採取反對態度、㊁九國公約會議之召集、雖在國聯會中日問題諮詢委員會通過决議案之後、但此項會議係獨立存在、為應付遠東局勢起見有召集之必要、卽無諮詢委員會之决議案、亦仍當加以召集、且美國非國聯會會員國、蘇聯並非九國公約簽字國、亦均出席會議、尤足證明會議之係獨立存在、㊂倘日本接受參加談判、則九國公約會擬指派委員會、僅令與遠東有關之少數國家參加討論、藉以滿足日本之願望、其結論則希望日本作有利之考慮、俾决定就上述情勢之下、是否可與中國及九國公約會議相接洽云、（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　九國公約會議主席比國外長斯巴克所草致日本政府之復文、首稱、‘日本政府答覆比國政府之照會、內曾聲明、日本政府在中國並無領土野心、反之、日本政府誠意期望設法以恊助中國民族之物質的精神的發展、增强中國與各外國之文化的經濟的合作、並尊重各外國在華之權利及利益、査以上各點、均屬一九二二年二月六日在華盛頓九國公約所規定之基本原則、日本卽願尊重此項原則、九國公約各簽字國代表自當予以備案、又査日本復文否認破壞九國公約、以為中國自一九二二年以後、因共產勢力之侵入、與國內局勢之變更、業已情移勢易、且以中國實施排外政策、阻止日本經濟活動、危害日本僑民生命、深加詆責、關於此層、九國公約業已加以規定、故於該約第七條載明、遇有類似情形、簽約国得加以提出、而由各簽約國相互磋商、此次比京會議、卽係根據該絛規定而召集者也、’此外、日本復文內表示、出席比京會議各國、勢將受國聯會决議案之束縛、因而提出異議、關於此層、九國公約會議復文特加以答辯、謂‘比京會議出席各國代表交換意見、純以九國公約為根據、’日本復文中、又以多數參加九國公約會義之國家與遠東並無多大關係、因而緹出異議、九國公約會議復文則指出九國公約各簽字國均有權使用公約所規定之權利、‘但出席比京會議各國代表、以為不妨顧及日本政府進行商談、此種交換意見、可在九國公約條文之機構以內為之、而其主要目的、則在使上述三要點得以明暸、而中日兩國衝突之解决、得以便利’云、（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　主席比國外長斯巴克宣讀復文後、中國首席代表顧維鈞博士起稱、如各代表以為中國代表團應離席、以便諸君進行討論、則渠願暫時退出、顧代表又稱、中國代表團不欲放棄權利、或規避參加會務之責任云、意代表馬柯迪與主席斯巴克均請弗退、中國代表團乃仍留會、至日本覆文如果尚佳、則中日兩國與負調解責任之小組委員會間之談判、將長久而辛勞、如日本覆文仍予拒絕、則會議須回至出發點、而另覓他種停戰方法、據正式發言人宣稱、今日會議之結果、極足使人興奮、一般討論均屬有益云、據目前現象觀之、致日復文尚將重行起草、明日脫稿後將於下星期一日提交全體會議通過、據秘書處發表公報稱、某種公文顯曾為人洩諸報紙、又稱、凡未經正式公布之文件、均不作凖云、（中央社五日路透電）</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　關於比國外長斯巴克所草致日本政府之復文草案、本日九國公約會議休息室內、有人主張設置起草委員會、從長討論、若干國家代表並建議、起草委員會僅包含英•美•比•三國代表、但法國外長台爾博斯則以法國在遠東利益極為重要、有關遠東之任何行動、法國均不應置身事外、故要求法國亦當參加起草委員會、各方對於起草委員會之組織、意見旣未能一致、最後始乃决定、由九國公約會議從事修正主席所提出之草案、並决定各國代表團應於本日、以書面提出對於草案之各項異議、彙交九國公約會議秘書處、由秘書處加以整理、擬成較為滿意之新草案、然後於明日提交全體會議、加以决定云、（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意代表提議中日直接交涉當被美英法代表駁倒</h3>
<p>聲明各國有權干涉遠東問題　决定設小組委員會擔任調處</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　九國公約會議今日在英美法各代表領導之下、經二小時之秘密會議、决定組織一小組委員會、以便導誘日本參加和解工作、又聞德國亦將被邀參預調解工作、當比外相斯巴克提出此項建議時、意大利代表馬柯迪立倡異議、主張中日爭端、由中日兩國自行直接交涉、美代表台維斯當向馬氏質問、‘意大利之意思、是否謂與會各國無權干涉中日爭端、’英代表艾登法代表台爾博斯、對於台維斯之質問、一致支持、馬氏之異議、遂為打銷、（四月國民電）</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　九國公約簽字國及蘇俄昨日舉行會議時、美國首席代表台維斯對於意國首席代表馬柯迪伯爵之建議、加以有力之駁復後、大會卽在原則上通過組織小組委員會、其往務為㊀對於日本等復比利時政府最初邀請之通牒及備忘錄、草擬復文、㊁研究日本合作之可能性、㊂	最後斡旋調解中日戰爭、至台維斯所嚴厲駁斥之意大利建議、卽為小組委員會可提議中日兩國應開始直接交涉、美代表卽突然起立、質問馬柯迪、是否卽謂其他各國均與中日爭執無關、再則組織小組委員會之議、係美代表台維斯在主席斯巴克傳觀日本復文後所提出、其目的係在取得日本之合作、斯巴克指明日本通牒、承認九國公約之存在、但提出數點、尚可加以適當之商討云、英法兩國首席代表艾登及台爾博斯等當卽贊成台維斯之提議、並表示小組委員會應斡旋中日停戰、惟台維斯復曾聲明、日本卽使拒不出席、會議亦當繼續進行、本日會議旋於五時散會、由比王利奧波德設茶會招待各國代表、原擬下午六時再行集會、討論小組委員會之人數及組織、嗣改今晨十時三十分重行開會、聞小組委員會之組織、英美比三國代表均為當然委員、但衆信倘法國參加該委員會、意大利勢必起而爭得一席地云、本日會議因以决定展期舉行、俾各國代表得於夜間從長互相磋商、至九國公約會議下次大會約須在一星期或十日之內始行召集、衆料日本仍將拒絕參加會議、但某某方面認為各國倘對於華盛頓會議以後遠東所發生之種種變化、如滿洲之征服等、能加以承認、則日本或可同意合作云、（中央社五日路透電）</p>
<p>比京　九國公約會議、本日午後二時三十分舉行非公開會議、直至四時十五分始行散會、據負責方面宣稱、各國代表討論結果、一致議决按照美國代表之提議、向日本政府發出申請書、用以答復該國拒不參加會議之照會、並聲明願在中日兩國之間擔任調處、九國公約會議定於明日午前十時三十分賡續開會、並當於明日午間發表公報、說明會議結果云、茲將本日開會情形追紀如下、本日開會時、首由主席卽比外長斯巴克宣稱、日本未將九國公約宣告廢止、足見猶有妥恊餘地、美代表台維斯繼之發言、主張向日本政府再度發出申請書、勸其採取妥恊熊度、英外相艾登當卽加以贊成、法外長台爾博斯除表示贊同外、並提議組織小組委員會、草擬此項申請書、並建議在中日兩國之間從事調處、關於此層、各國代表均無異議、獨意代表馬柯迪伯爵反對以廣泛權限畀予小組委員會、認為應由中日雙方直接進行談判、法外長台爾博斯當加以駁復、謂㊀關係各國在遠東方面所保有之利益、均有加以維護之義務、㊁各該國對於遠東糾紛若果加以過問、此乃依據九國公約第七第八兩條規定而然、結果意代表馬柯迪並未堅持、而對於以廣泛權限畀予小組委員會一層加以接受、至此、各國代表卽進一步討諭小組委員會組織問題、據消息靈通人士所知、當時曾有兩種擬議㊀小組委員會、由英•美•法•意•比•葡•荷七國組成之、㊁僅由英•美•比•三國組成之、特法意兩國旣	在遠東方面保有重大利益、勢必要求參加小組委員會、因此第一種辦法、較有採用之可能、至有人提議僅由英美兩國單獨向中日雙方進行接洽一層、美代表台維斯業已加以拒絕、（中央社四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法外長返國一行</h3>
<p>白魯塞爾　法國外交部長台爾博斯頃於本日晨間九時四十分遄返巴黎、俾與希臘國王喬治二世會唔、本日九國公約會議開會時當由該國外交部次長台德桑代表出席、英國外相艾登亦因私事須返倫敦一行、定於本日午後、搭乘該國軍用飛機啟程（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德對中日戰事聞擬出任調停</h3>
<p>中日雙方均加否認　東京又有離奇空氣</p>
<p>［柏林］今日得悉、德元首希特勒業已召集黨政軍要人多名會議、討論德國直接調處中日戰事是否可行參加會議人物聞為國防部長白隆堡•外交部長半賴特•航空部長戈林•及海軍部長雷陀等人、惟中日大使館對於德國調停之說、均力加否認、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］九國公約會議事、頃由各報加以評論、咸謂務當試行調解、據日報駐柏林訪員電稱此間外交界盛傳、德國政府準備出任調停、該國駐英大使里賓特羅甫即當與中日兩國代表進行談判、藉以確定各該國之意向（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　關於德國調處中日爭端一項傳聞、九國公約會議中國代表團發言人頃宣稱、該國首席代表顧維鈞博士、並無所知云、（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］外傳德國政府準備調處中日爭端、此間負責人士頃鄭重予以否認、據聞此種謠傳、乃因國防部長白倫堡將軍曾於日昨接見中國國防會議委員蔣百里將軍而起、此間日本人士並向哈瓦斯社訪員發表談話稱、德國出任調停之事、在勢實無可能、‘現行爭端、純係中日兩國之事、第三國之干涉、即使出於日本友邦、亦所反對、’此外、此間中國人士亦稱、德國調停之說雖有所聞、但中國無意加以接受云、（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］中國國防會議委員蔣白里將軍、已於本日晨間、偕同該國駐德大使程天放、前往比國京城、俾以觀察員資格、列席九國公約會議、此間中國人士頃證實、蔣百里將軍他日重來德國時、當由希特勒元首予以接見、其日期約在本月九日即國社黨起義紀念日之後、（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［東京］日本官塲方面、今日竭力否認日本有傾向和平之行動、但外間亦盛傳、日本甚願中止上海方面之戰事、外務省對於調解之可能、拒絕討論並避免日本之目標究屬土地的或主義的問題、並聞消息靈通者稱、關於調停遠東戰事之人選、日方覺希特勒實較羅斯福更易於接受云（中央社五日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本設大本營</h3>
<p>軍政意見一致　本月中可實現</p>
<p>［東京］日本為應付戰局之進展與其結束起見、而擬設置之大本營方案、陸軍部內之意見已趨一致、卽在政府方面、自近衛首相以及各首腦等亦多諒解無異議、且至四日海軍方面亦同意、因此、設置大本營一問題、至此所有各關係方面之解見、巳臻一致、按大本營者、依照軍令組織、其內容悉照戰時大本營條例所規定、明明為一純粹之統帥機關、其中構成分子、如幕僚長之參謀總長與軍令部總長、幕僚及各機關中之高等部屬、完全限於軍人充任、故此、他如國務總理大臣•各大臣•及樞密院議長等行政官、不能充任大本營分子、而上項陸海軍大臣則以之擔任統帥部與行政部間往來接觸之任、但査當年中日日俄兩戰役時之前例、在大本營中之御前會議、係由特旨欽命國務總埋大臣•樞密議長•國務大臣等參加策劃其間者、因此有例可援、故今茲之御前會議、或亦如此辦理、亦未可知、要之、大本營為一純粹之統帥機關、其與行政機關固全然不發生關係、（五日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］報知新聞今日聲稱、日本全國現漸贊成日本對華宣戰之見解、海軍中人亦要求宣戰、惟陸軍則積極反對此舉、以其易惹起國際糾紛、設立大本營一事、在海軍省不復反對後、可於十一月十日成立、在此組織之下、政府與軍部之行政權、將合併為一、以海陸軍首腦及其參謀輔佐日皇與大元帥指揮一切、陸海兩相將為內閣之接洽人員、閣員與樞密院人員、僅可於日皇特別命令下、參加大本營之會議云、朝日新聞近載一文、謂大本營如被海陸軍認為對華長期作戰所必要、則政府應無反對此項組織之理由、惟內閣因此而起之改組、首相宜愼重處理之云、（中央社五日路透電）</p>
<h3>比前外長奉命組閣</h3>
<p>白魯塞爾　前農業部長即天主教黨參議員比埃洛組閣失敗之後、國王利奧波德三世頃委託前外長期巴克組織新內閣、按斯巴克現任九國公約會議主席、係比社會黨靑年領袖之一、聲望素著、其政治主張以視黨魁樊迪文較為溫和、（中央社四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德總領事館來函聲明日本同盟通訊社造謠</h3>
<p>據在華德國官方人士鄭重聲稱、關於本月一日同盟社所發消息、謂德國著名經濟學家前任總理路德博士、日前在天津德國總領事館招待新聞記者談話中、曾作下例申明、謂‘德國將與日本密切合作、以實現開發華北經濟之計劃’一節、絕無其事、上項消息完全為日人造謠、淆亂聽聞、（海通社）逕啟者、本月三日貴報載有專論一文、題為德意與遠東事件、內有‘德國的財閥路德到了天津、向日本同盟社發表談話、主張日德兩國合作、開發華北、我們希望日本方面所宣傳的消息、是完全造謠………’等語、查該項消息、確係同盟社之自由發明、德國海通社業於今晨發出更正、相應函達、即希査照海通社今晨所發更正、俾明此事眞相、爲荷、此致申報館編輯部、代理總領事白仁德、一九三七年十一月五日、</p>
<h3>李維諾夫演說全文</h3>
<p>［莫斯科］蘇聯外交委員長李維諾夫在比京九國公約會議席上發表演說、辭云、余應華盛頓九國公約簽字國之邀請、並根據國聯决議案、來此出席會議、得聆各邀請固尤其美國代表關於遠東事件之宏論、深致感佩、余今在此、實無發表特別宣言之必要、尤因此次會議當前問題、亦即在日內瓦曾經討論之問題、日內瓦即召集此次會議之策源地、而關於當前局勢應說之一切、在日內瓦亦已言盡、至在穌聯方面、則無論關於反對侵略作為一種國際現象之一般問題、或此種侵略之積極表現之個別事件、亦曾就其本身見解、屢加聲明、而其所發表之意見、亦均係從其對於和平槪念出發、此種槪念當亦為除極少數外、各國政府從而建立共同立塲之共同出發點、而各國團不同點之發生、則僅在從共同槪念、轉移至如何採取最有效之辦法、以保障和平、或於和平被破壞之地、加以恢復、無論如何、苟欲採取任何辦法、其不可免之第一步、自必係在國際會議席上或其他組織中共同討論、</p>
<p>關終某某數種事件、僅召集會議共同討論、即巳足稱爲蘊有肯定的道德價值之一種行動、正因此故、余謹代表敝政府對此次會議道賀、並對於比政府及其外長特別對於其籌備此次會議之辛勞及其給與各代表團之殷勤招待、深致謝忱、</p>
<p>近年來國際生活方面巳增得一份極可寶貴之經騐、此項經騐、使吾人不得不注意、一切國際會議前途遍佈的危險的陷坑與轍槽、此項經騐告知吾人、國際會議•委員會•及其他組織、雖在召集時本有肯定之目標、有時或竟至忘却其直接目的及附帶任務、轉而遵循其自身之利益、為自身而存在、尤以其存在期間延長時、當呈如此現象、在此種情形之下、此種會議每以維持其自身存在、追求其發起人及組織者之道德的滿足、追求其本身表面之成功、為主要目的、而此種表面成功、則與原來召集會議之目的之成功、並不時時符合、有時此種不同之利益、甚至發生矛盾、有時甚至原以消滅及尅服侵略為目的、而召集之會議或委員會、反而公然變爲侵略者之工具、被其利用為進行侵略行動之烟幕及助力、此種情形之發生、乃在各該國際組織、一面企圖勸誘侵略者改變態度、一面又與侵略者發生接觸、</p>
<p>在屢向侵略者讓步之談判過程中、原意本十分高尚之人物、即不免時時超過限度、不自覺陷入與侵略者相同之見解、實際上贊助並慫恿其行動、苟問題係關於一國侵略他國、而此侵略並巳達到某種成功時、國際組織每為本身之成功起見、極易對侵略者曰、‘取去爾用武力略得之贓物、從茲安靜無躁’、而對被侵略者則曰、‘不必抵抗罪惡、與爾之侵略敵人和好無間可也’、</p>
<p>此或為會議之表面成功、然决非和平之勝利、更非和平國家之勝利、此種成功、唯有引起新的侵略行動、造成召集新會議之必要、從此永遠輪廻、直至無盡期、</p>
<p>此種國際組織脫離正道之時、尤可造成一種環境、使侵略更被縱容而擴大增加、緣國際會議苟有此種情形、和平國家必然發生磨擦、從而分裂衝突、為侵略者所利用、當此侵略者日益趨於勾結、共同造成對多數國家威脅之時、和平國家尤其有團結一致之必要、</p>
<p>在目前條件下任何會議、均易遭遇此種危險、余特別加以縷述、余惟願此次比京九國公約會議、以及吾人將從各邀請國聆悉之建議、能獲得成功、余深信此次會議之目的、將避免上述危險、而所有建議、不但能以恢復遠東和平、並以恢復公正之和平、不縱容侵略而束縛侵略之和平、遠及將來並普遍世界之和平、（四日塔斯社電）</p>

<h3>九國公約會議美總統之期望</h3>
<p>英法美能否合作之試騐　奎松擬闢馬尼拉自由港</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　此間各國代表今日深信、美總統羅斯福將以九國公約會議爲能否獲得英法二國合作反對法西斯集團之試金石、因羅斯福總統於芝加哥演說時曾表示、美國有準備隔離侵略國及與各國合作維持世界安寗之意思、故一般人猜測、美國目前之態度、實在試探英法有無與美合作、圖謀解决此一重大世界和平問題之準備、同時亦所以測騐美國輿論之反響、因此、各國代表以爲九國公約會議之結果、不僅足以轉移美國之外交政策、同時對於世界安危、意義亦非常重大、就英法俄三國外長今次於會議中一致發言贊助美代表台維斯之主張而觀、可知此項試騐已有相當之成果、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］菲律賓總統奎松、因鑒於滬戰延長對世界各國在上海方面之商業、不無影響、特提議願將馬尼拉開放、作爲東方自由商埠、並表示對於移轉上海方面之大商塲至馬尼拉甚願盡全力與各國商家合作、今日此間官吏及商界中人對奎松氏之提議、甚爲興奮、目極樂於接受、美國商界中人認奎松之提議、足以解决美國在東方之商業發展問題、即使日人在上海方面繼續其軍事行動至無已時、美國商業亦不致於受影響、根據一般觀察、若馬尼拉開放爲自由貿易商埠、絕不能與香港競爭、因爲事實上香港之航運、遠在馬尼拉之上、但無論如何、馬尼拉可以從中國上海方面、賺得一批商業、尤以運輸較速、足以戰勝地理上之一切阻碍、在克里夫倫之國際貿易會議對此問題特別注意、對於非律賓商業及營業前途、將特別討論、聞美國之大商家赴此會議者甚爲踴躍、紐約方面對於開放馬尼拉代替上海爲東方商埠之提議、亦表示興奮、目下正在估計此種移轉後之利益與前途、（五日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本畏“杯葛”</h3>
<p>美國鳥特萊著特譯英美經濟武器　能够終止戰爭</p>
<p>世界人士現正建議以“杯葛”爲遏止日本在華侵略的一種技術。這種“杯葛”，確可收效，因爲日本在經濟上，甚至比意大利更多可攻的弱點。再則，意大利在安靖十餘年，養精蓄銳之後，才從事征服阿比西尼亞，日本呢，在壓服滿洲三千萬民衆，並鞏固傀儡國，以防蘇聯的努力中，已覺得筋疲力盡，接着便圖征服中國，談何容易，以征服阿比西尼亞和征服全國一致，不惜任何犧牲，决心抗戰的中國，那難易眞有霄壤之別。</p>
<p>一九三七年上半年中，日本的入超，比一九二四年大地震那年的總數還大，差不多已到了一九三六年全年入超的總數。甚至在戰事發作之前，輸出只及輸入的三分之二。日本因爲缺乏外國投資，無從彌補貿易上的差額，所以只有把已經不足的金凖備運出，以資周轉。</p>
<p>一九三六和三七年，日本龐大的入超，其原因不單在購買軍火程序所需的大批金屬和機器，並且在自一九三二年起，原料價廉一個時代中，適逢工値極低，所獲的利益，在最近兩年已見减少。因爲最近兩年，世界棉花和羊毛的價格，都已飛漲，貨物的成本便隨以高起，所以上年日本的紡織品，輸出的數量和價値，都開始减少，並且江河日下，覺得極難和人競爭佔勝。</p>
<p>不列顚帝國現吸收日本輸出百分之一八，供給日本輸入百分之三一，美國（菲律濱除外）吸收百分之二二，供給百分之三二，故不列顚帝國和美國共同吸收日本輸出之半數，而供給日本的需要品百分之六三。再則，日本輸出的生絲，美國獨購百分之八五，生絲是日本不靠輸入原料而成的唯一輸出品，就實際而論，日本的整個社會機構，是靠美國的絲巿。</p>
<p>日本不可少的輸入品，是美國和荷屬東印度的油，印度馬來澳洲的鐵和廢鐵。日本帝國雖從外國輸入鐵沙，但所產的生鐵，連滿洲在內，在一九三六年最高的數額，也不過二百九十萬噸，這年英國却產八萬噸，德國竟高至一千五百萬噸。一九三六年日本鋼產的數額，連滿洲在內，只有五百五十萬噸，英國却有一千一百八十萬噸，德國比英更多六百二十萬噸。日本煤的銷費，只及英國五分之一，日本的重工業，並未和輕工業等量發展，日本甚至不能自造汽車，有許多種機器，須仰給於泰西各國。</p>
<p>日本在戰爭中主要的弱點，是農田仍用原始時代的方法耕種，依賴牲畜之力，農業機器，却幾無所知，故每畝的產量雖高，但每人的產量却極低的。農民一家全年的辛苦，在承平時，也只能養活自己的一家，和其他兩家，所以把農區的巨數男丁調入陸軍，女子調入製造軍火的工廠以後，農產便要暴落，而一方面數十萬大軍駐在外國，又須源源供給糧食，比他們務農的時候，銷耗定將大大增多。</p>
<p>日本每和外國作眞正戰爭，都靠泰西各國財政上的援助。今日日本的財政地位，比從前任何惡劣時代，都差得更多，在上年年底，已不得不漸漸傾嚮通貨臌脹，以爲剜肉補瘡之計，本年四月份，各物薹售的價格，比一九三一年十二月金本位廢棄之前，差不多已高超一倍，雖然工資已見低落。五金價格自一九三六年起，已漲高百分之七六，紡織品和燃料，也漲高百分之二五，零售價格却漲高百分之三○。因此本年首四個月中，各處因生活艱難，紛紛罷工，竟達破紀錄的最高數字。薹售和零售價格漲高的程度，相差很遠，大足表示小本經紀人和手藝人的處境困難。</p>
<p>日本的生活代價，甚至在此次戰事發生之前，已飛也似的逐步增高，這大半因爲日本屢年的預算案，都是入不敷出的原故。自從滿案發生以後，頂算案的不足之數，總以募債彌補，而不足之數却逐年增高，據當局估計，本年國家支出將達二八七二兆（每兆百萬）日元，經常收入只有稍過一五○○兆元之數。新債供給九六五兆元，捐稅供給一三一三兆元，而對華戰爭的新用費，差不多要到五五○○兆元，估計捐稅和國家專賣等等收入，現還不及抵補支出的三分之一。再有一層須注意者，軍費的支出，是按短期戰爭估計的。估計一九三六年全國國民的收人，（據三井經濟研究所估計）只有一萬三千兆元，國債在上年年底已達一萬一千兆元，而國家的支出，却有五千五百兆元之多。那意義的重大，是可想而知了，日本的國民每人平均的歲入，不足二百元，國家現要佔用他們的百分之四十。日本社會制度的不穩固，却和經濟相同，人民務農的約佔半數，（未完）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>德意日反共協定</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>德意日反共協定將於今日在羅馬正式簽字。這項協定據外電所傳。不過以交換關於共產國際活動的情報為目的。並無軍事同盟的意義。但當世界和平國家正對中國及西班牙的戰禍深感不安之秋。有這三國協定的宣布。卻也足以反映出德意日軍事方面共同的企圖來。</p>
<p>德意日三國為了自國資源的缺乏。都要發動重分世界的戰爭。這早就是十分明顯的形勢了。它們扯起“反共”的旗子來。無非要借此做戰爭行為的烟幕。李維諾夫說過。“反共”這名詞有着地質學的礦物學的涵羲。這話似乎有些挖苦。其實是十分確當的。我們從血淋淋的現實中間。可不是已經看到。我國北部的煤礦鐵礦棉田鹽田。以及西班牙的銅鑛鋅鑛都是跟“反共”有關的麽。</p>
<p>當然。在三國當局看來。“反共”這一動聽的名詞。多少是可以博得其他資本主義國家的同情的。然而跟隨着這一名詞的可怕的行動。不但已使這種同情成為不可能。反而足使其他國家對這一種思想運動非常的厭恨。因為其它國家都天在加緊國內的團結以自保。而反共運動只有引起國内的禍患罷了。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>華北戰局中的幾個重要問題</h3>
<p>— 金仲華</p>
<p>最近數日來，華北戰局的發展，又到了一個新的嚴重階段。晋北方面，敵軍被我阻止於忻口山地，達三星期之久，現在敵軍忽然衝破我陣地，進抵忻縣，我軍已退守石嶺關。晋東方面，敵軍又攻陷陽泉，進迫壽陽。這兩方面敵軍的進展，使太原處於非常緊急的情况中。晋東的戰局，本來和平漢與津浦兩綫上的軍事，是有着密切關聯的，因為我軍若沿這兩綫北上反攻，則由正太路西攻的敵軍，必然要感到後路的危險，不得不停滯前進；然而幾天來雖已一再傳說這兩綫上我軍的反攻，實際上漳河與徒駭河兩岸的戰綫，始終沒有多大的變動。非但如此，而且平漢路上的敵軍，又攻陷漳河南岸的彰德，使豫北的局勢也增加了嚴重性。我們認為西戰塲與北戰塲上這種發展，比之東戰塲是一小部分戰綫的移動，要重大到無數倍，我們决不能加以絲毫的輕視。</p>
<p>華北是我們與敵人决戰的塲合，而山西尤其是戰略運用上的一個軍要關鍵，這是大家所知道的。所以堅守山西與發動平漢津浦兩綫的反攻，早已有許多人指出，認為是挽救華北戰局的兩個要着。在幾星期來，敵軍大部被阻於忻口，而雁門關與平型關附近的敵軍交通綫，都被我遊擊隊截斷，在平漢與津浦兩綫上，又屢次傳來反攻進展的消息，表示這兩方面我們的戰略，正在着着的展開；但在目前這突然的轉變中，為什麼晋北，晋東與平漢綫方面，都造成了這樣不利的局面呢？而這種發展對於今後華北戰局的前途，又將有若何的影響？假使影響是相當嚴重的，我們更將如何的加以挽救？這幾個重要問題，我們現在必須愼重的加以一番考察。</p>
<p>目前山西戰局的逆轉，我們認為並不是由於西戰塲上戰略有何種錯誤，而主要是受了北戰塲的影響。石家莊的失陷，使敵人得以進攻娘子關，威脅晋東；現在正太路方面敵軍向西猛攻，晋北方面自然也受到了影響。不過，從軍事的發展上看，平漢綫我軍的作戰，决不是不够猛勇；這方面的失利，還是由於另外的兩種原因：一種是在這方面，我們主力軍雖能堅守正面陣地，奮死抗敵，而側面沒有流動的遊擊隊的配合，不能牽制敵軍的兩翼及後路，所以石家莊的失陷，是由於敵軍在葉城渡濾沱河，攻我後路，娘子關的放棄，又是由於敵軍突破固關，使我不能不迅速後退。另一種原因，是華北幾個戰綫上，還缺少調整，例如，敵軍集中力量進攻晋東，平漢與津浦兩綫上，敵軍的後援空虛，我們却未能及時反攻；這在津浦綫方面，尤其明顯，幾天來敵軍一部西調平漢綫與晋東，一部分北開關外，保守滿洲，在津浦前方的敵軍，不過二千人，其餘大部分是偽軍，這時候我們不從魯北反攻滄縣，德州，坐視晋東方面敵軍以全力猛撲，眞是戰略上的重大疏忽。這種情形，也許是由於華北幾條鐵道，成為不相關連的縱綫，所以每一綫上都成為獨立的作戰單位，也許還有其他的原因；但我們看到敵人利用了北戰塲上的優勢，以補救西戰塲上的失敗，又利用了津浦綫上的沒有遇到堅強阻力，以帮助平漢綫上的突破我軍陣地，可以知道敵人的幾方面作戰，却是相互配合着的。我軍的暫時失利，可說却是由於這種戰略上的疏忽所致。</p>
<p>但是我們認為這暫時形勢的逆轉，决不致使我們整個華北的戰局，蒙受重大不利的影響。這從我軍的抗戰勇氣只有比以前增强，就可以知道。同時，在我們軍事政治最高當局的發言中，都已經一再指出，卽使我們退到了黃河綫，我們仍然可以堅决地抗戰下去，可見這一二處陣綫的移動，對於我們抗戰到底的計劃，是絕對不會有影響的。尤其我們知道，在目前敵軍要進襲太原，尚須越過北面的石陵關與東面壽陽一帶的山地，而在太原西南兩面，還有半個山西，在山嶺重疊中，可以佈成許多條陣綫，阻止敵人的進展。</p>
<p>不過，在目前經過一次形勢逆轉的時候，我們必須竭力在軍事上加以挽救，却也是非常重要的。這在我們軍政當局的考慮中，當然早已有迅速的佈置。假使我們要提出幾個特殊的注意的，則華北軍事上的加强統一指揮，使幾個戰綫上的發展，能夠調整，是最重要的。還有，主力戰與遊擊戰的更廣大的配合，使它不要僅限於晋北，也是十分需要的。此外，我們西北邊疆的少數民族，我們在政治上應多多保障他們的權利，使他們不致被敵人所挑撥利用，也是值得注意的。我們要知道，敵人若能進抵黃河，控制晋局，他們的侵略也决不會中止，而將一直西進，繼續擴展其無限的野心。所謂‘得隴望蜀，’這句中國的古語，與敵人的侵略計劃，正相配合的。所以，無論如何，我們必須在敵人的每一處進展中，給敵人以最猛烈的打擊；我們尤其要利用失敗中的敎訓，迅速挽救過去軍事上的缺點，加强作戰上的力量，把敵人掃蕩岀去。</p>
<h3>廖將軍談抗戰</h3>
<p>壯烈犧牲表證旺盛士氣　衝殺前去爭取最後勝利</p>
<p>中央社云、在風雨悽切的秋景裹掙扎於泥濘的羊腸小徑大概走了二三小時、終於平安地到達了目的地、在那裹見到了率領數萬健兒、遠途跋涉、來到東戰塲參戰的廖將軍、他有着魁梧的體魄碩長的身材更有着沉毅果敢的精神、和靄可親的態度、充分表露着崇高偉大的人格、記者和他握着手表示敬意之後、便談到他們來上海參戰的經過、現在把他的談話作一忠實的報道、他說、‘抗日是中華民族求解放圖生存的唯一出路、日本帝國主義者一天加緊一天的壓迫我們、侵凌我們、非到把我們整個的民族完全毀滅了、是不會給我們以一時的或一地的淸凈的、所以我們祗有抱定犧牲的决心、犧牲到底的决心、和敵人奮鬥、使敵人認識我們是决不可以武力來屈服的、</p>
<p>全面抗戰發動之後、我們全省的抗戰情緒、到達了沸點、武裝同志爭先恐後的要求出師殺敵、軍事當局幾乎無法應付後來才决定了用抽籤的方法抽調了×師、前來參戰、我們踏上了火綫的時候、敵人正開始第六次的總攻、敵人首先利用他充裕的軍火、來摧毀我們的陣綫、所投的炸彈、日以數百計、敵砲所發砲彈、日以數千計、可是我們絕不畏懼、奮不願身、尤其是下級官長、身先士卒、衝鋒陷陣、視死如歸、雖有敵人猛烈的砲火之下、不但不退、反是前仆後繼的衝向前去、所以這次所蒙的損失、非常重大、可是這樣的壯烈犧牲、正表證了我們旺盛的士氣、和抗戰的决心、使敵人不能輕易的得到尺寸進展不過敵人還沒有殲盡、我們更要抱定犧牲到底的决心、踏上以先烈的熱血所洗刷過的抗戰解放的路上、衝殺前去、以爭取最後的勝利、廖將軍說到此地、用着堅决的肯定的語氣反覆地唸着、這給記者以極深刻的印象、當在執筆的時候、他那沉毅果敢的態度、還深印於腦中、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>照一般的觀察。現在的局勢。共分兩大壁壘。一個是和平主義的，一個是反和平主義的。兩個壁壘有相當的鞏固，尤其是新日德義三國“反共”協定。預定在今日簽字。更足證明其說之非誣。</p>
<p>和平陣綫之鞏固與否。茲姑不論。僅談反和平陣綫。日德義三國在現在某種情勢之下。自有連結之可能或必要。但是此種結合。外表是一致的。而內心則同牀各夢。决不一致。</p>
<p>國際間縱橫捭闔的陣容。原是時時刻刻在不斷地變化。現在日本欲遂行其大陸政策。故不屑卑躬屈節。與德義兩國團結一氣。一方面是牽制英美法俄諸國。一方面卽可達其素抱之目的。德義之“爲他人作嫁衣裳。”而結果非但一無所得。反傷了第三者素來友好的感情。殊不値得。</p>
<p>幷且國際間的信義原靠不住的。歐洲大戰之時。德國也應認識了日本的面貌。奧揆遇刺事件發生。意國卽陳兵北境。又認識了意國的肺腑。由以前的歷史。而推測未來之變化。現在德義被日本利用。而他日德義欲利用日本之時。恐怕日本又將處若何的態度呢。</p>
<p>以德人銳利之目光。寗有不知日人之陰謀詭計。反覆多端。故德國此次不願參加九國公約會議。以免我國之誤會。早已洞悉敵人之懷抱歟。</p>
<h3>敵宣傳將對我宣戰圖威嚇愛好和平國家</h3>
<p>脅迫比京會議敷衍了事　以達到其直接交涉目的</p>

<p>首先寄語在各地無數萬關懷着南京的人們、我們母親的首都是安然無恙的、而且她將永遠是如此、有人比他為第二的瑪德里一、那是不適當的、不過現在還能幸福地安居在首都的懷抱中的人們、努力自愛吧、不要辜負了在火綫中浴血苦戰着的同胞們、</p>
<p>十月二十一日下午、從浦口動身的行前、有敵機的一次轟炸、算是替記者送行、</p>
<p>在車中的旅客們、都時時提心着空襲、總在神經過敏的驚擾中一夜不能安眠、可是謝謝天、除去車行較平素慢了一些以外、沒有經受任何意外的事變、在第二天早上、天老亮了的時候、一路平安到徐州、</p>
<p>在徐州本是預定留一兩天的、在那裹有本社駐徐通訊員陳凌亞君、一切都由他招待、毫沒有感到人地生疏的麻煩、</p>
<p>在走出徐州車站的時候、就可以看見敵機纖暴轟炸的遺跡了、津浦車站西面、徐州最繁華的大馬路上的幾家店舖、遺留着被轟炸過的殘跡、</p>
<p>車站東面是子房山、在太平的時候、大概是一個名勝的所在吧、可是因為八月三十日敵機特別的光顧、現在已成了一片瓦礫場、參觀這遺跡、好像是在徐州第一件應當作的工作了、於是就約陳君同行、正好陳君已於前日答應美國新聞記者、要攝幾張照片、以供向國際暴露敵軍的殘酷、</p>
<p>子房山因為山上的子房廟而得名、相傳是楚漢相爭、張良吹簫破楚兵的地方、現在山上有兩千多住家、大概佔有徐州全部十分之一的人口了、剛剛走近山脚、就已經望見了上面的斷壁頹垣、不由得令人發生一種荒凉的感覺、山上差不多十室九空、絕無人跡的樣子、</p>
<p>據說八月三十日那天、是徐州的第一次轟炸、而且是完全出人意料之外的、約在傍晚時候、有十二架飛機、成隊地從西北方面飛來、可是沒有空襲警報、當時子房廟中正駐着軍隊、兵士和老百姓、一起都在子房廟前的一個亭子裏乘凉、因為沒有警報、大家都認定那必然是我國的飛機了、我們不難想像在內地的軍民看见了自己的飛機、是怎樣地歡躍、可是當飛到他們頭頂上的時候、飛機突然變了脸炸彈和機槍掃射、連着飛下來了、有六七十家被毀於這次的轟炸之下、傷亡的人數、總在一百五十以上、</p>
<p>當時的悲慘狀態、沒有身臨其境的人、是難於描述的、有一個在津浦路上當工程師的一家人老少十餘口、全被壓在倒塌的磚牆與屋頂之下、另一個藏在屋內的五六歲的女孩子、聽見第一陣的爆炸聲過去之後、從屋裏探頭出來觀望、可是就在這時候中了新落下來的炸彈的碎片、肚腸子被炸出來、坐在子房廟前亭子裏乘凉的兵士與平民躱過了炸彈、沒有躱過機槍的掃射、</p>
<p>子房廟是淸初重修過的、還保存着乾隆下江南時畫寫的碑文這座古廟、雖是被轟炸的目標、却只受了些微的傷損、正殿裏堂皇的子房神像還依然健在、也許是因為他的神靈保佑吧、旁殿的土地與彌勒佛神像、就不算有靈了、特別是那個唏唏哈哈大肚子的彌佛、他的肚子已經裂成兩段、</p>
<p>炸得最悲慘的幾家、就在子房廟的隔壁、我們選了一家還比較完整的走進去、可是同樣什麽也看不見了、只剩下一座空屋殼、最使人有所感觸的、是這空房裏還留着幾隻從前人家飼養的鴿子、和平之象徵的鴿子呀、你們也嚇破了膽嗎、為什麽一聽見人的脚步聲、就那般地驚飛起來呢、在一間空屋裏、我們還發見一張有二尺長依然完整老婦人像、親愛的老婆婆、你孤獨地坐在那裏、是捨不得離開你的故居嗎、或者是你眞那麽頑强等候着敵機的再來、準備與敵偕亡嗎、</p>
<p>徐州的防空設備、當然比不上首都、因此敵機可以毫無忌憚地飛行得非常之低、於是在這附近的鄕民間、傳播開許多關於敵機低飛的傳說、當然這些並不十分可靠、有些甚至是不可能的、但是從這種傳說中、我們可以看出敵機在一般村鎮間是怎樣地大膽包天、較之他們怯懦地偷進南京的高空、藏在雲間、一聽見高射砲聲便倉皇而逃的那種可憐樣子、眞是天上地下了、</p>
<p>鄕下各地、常有防守土匪而建築的土樓、那充其量也不過有城市中普通的三層樓房那麽高、現在作為掩護在頂上放着樹枝或草葉一類的東西、誰知這掩護眞是多餘的了、當敵機飛過去的時候、時常會將那些掩護物掃除得一乾二凈、甚至在機身上就掛着那批掃除了的樹枝、一個仰臥在田地裏的鄕民、可以望得見敵機的飛機師、而且他還確信他看見了那個飛機師面孔上的鬍鬚、在敵機的殘忍無恥的轟炸之下、老百姓們不能只是幽囚在恐怖裏半眞實地半虛構地製造些於恐怖之中而又帶點滑稽味的傳說、是想在比較閒暇的時候、用作談笑的資料、以為彼此的慰藉的吧、徐州是津浦與隴海兩條鐵路綫的交叉點、是交通上與軍事上的要地、敵機時常來光顧、自是意中事、警報每天至少總有兩三次、敵機時常是路過、並不在此地投彈、其實除去它轟炸的目標車站之外、也沒有什麽再可轟炸的地方了、</p>
<p>記者在徐州的這一天、也遇到一次小轟炸、警報發出的時候、我和陳君正走到車站附近的地方、只得暫避在車站旁路工們建築的一個防空壕裏、隨着飛機聲來了兩聲轟響、震得耳朶嗡嗡、好像炸彈、就落在身邊似的、事後的調查、才知道還頗有相當的距離、一彈落陸軍醫院門前、一彈落中興煤礦公司院內、都是很小的炸彈、留下兩個小小的洞穴、震倒幾間房子、有一片炸彈碎片打進樹幹有五寸多深、雖說是極小的炸彈、那響聲和破壞力、也就頗有可觀了、（未完）</p>

<h3>目前迫切的抗戰工作</h3>
<p>— 劉育才</p>
<p>世界强盜日本帝國主義者的侵略中國，迄今已有數十年的野心和事實，這是毋庸諱言的；自九一八事變以來，先後侵佔我們東北四省，最近蘆溝橋事變，又攻陷平津，其蓄意佔據整個的華北，進而直逼華中華南，證之八一三的滬戰爆發，更顯著的暴露出敵人的貪得無饜和得寸進尺的企圖；這不過是敵人想實現其大陸政策的迷夢底尖銳化。反之，適足以促其在華勢力的加速底崩潰而逐漸消滅！換句話說：這正是給與中國和敵人淸算血賬的時期，進而掙脫數十年來所受的蹂躪和壓迫，終於獲得了最後的勝利的機會！</p>
<p>我們全國的軍民，當此暴敵壓境火併的目前，我們第一須要認淸，敵人的武力是不足畏的；我們要在政府的領導之下，同心協力，各盡所能，來充分地發揮我們民衆對敵作殊死戰的自衛力！那末勝利是必將屬於我們的；我們不必人人親赴前綫，才算是抗戰，我們必要每一個人各盡其力，來參加各種抗戰救亡的工作；現在大家能够見到的民衆團體的戰時服務，可以說僅僅是極小的部份；上海的抗戰，已有二個多月，上海有三百萬以上的市民，除了外籍人民老弱婦孺之外，至少有二百萬以上的民衆，如果以這樣一個數量來有組織有訓練的加入戰時工作，我敢說後方民衆的抗戰實力，比較目前的成績，更要超過數十百倍；這一個宏厚的力量，可惜直到現在，還没有具體的發動和計劃。其次：關於各處的後方民衆的抗戰服務，我們還覺得十分的單薄和不足，雖然各方面都有高級幹練人員在那裏發動，可是終不見有效地充分表現出來；從這一點上看來，目前的補救辦法，應積極推動下列幾項工作，那是刻不容緩的：</p>
<p>第一：以上海市為出發點，由市抗敵後援會通令各合法戰時救亡團體的宣傳隊，分別編制流動宣傳隊赴各地積極發揮其宣傳力量。</p>
<p>第二：現在各地負責推動戰時工作的人員，尤須加緊其工作，從速組織訓練大量的後方民衆，並指導其各項服務方針，以增厚抗戰效率。</p>
<p>第三：由政府領導之下，組織各省市縣村的民衆武裝團體，積極實施軍訓，必要時可以加强前綫的軍力，退一步也至少可以肅淸後方的漢奸，間接就是削弱敵人侵略的力量。</p>
<p>第四：由各地方行政機關主持，發動永遠對日經濟絕交運動，以制敵人對外貿易的死命，間接就是引起敵人國內的經濟恐慌，給予野心者一個重大的打擊。</p>
<p>上面所說的數項，都是目前急切需要努力的抗戰工作，無一不是救亡圖存的積極步驟，國難至此地步，正是我們同胞毁家纾難捨身救國的時候，斷不容袖手旁觀，苟且偷安，祇有在全國民團實際的參加抗戰，才能爭得民族的生存自由，也祇有整個民族革命的抗戰運動，才可以獲得最後的勝利！</p>

<h3>Nine-Power Treaty Conference Encounters Difficulties, Our Representative Briefly Expresses Intention to Withdraw</h3>
<p>Chairman's Proposed Draft Reply to Japan Deemed Inappropriate and Not Passed; Only Principles Agreed Upon in Two Meetings Yesterday, Further Discussion Today</p>
<p>Brussels – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference was held in a closed session at 10:40 AM. The meeting began with a speech by the Mexican representative, Fabila, who strongly advocated for the necessity of fulfilling international obligations. Following him, Dr. Wellington Koo, the chief Chinese representative, stated that if China's presence at the conference hindered the discussion of the reply to Japan, the Chinese delegation was prepared to temporarily withdraw from the meeting, while fully reserving its position on all decisions made by the conference. At this point, the Chairman, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, persuaded the Chinese delegation to remain in attendance, and the Chinese representative agreed. Spaak then read out the draft of the reply to the Japanese government. After the reading, the Soviet representative, Litvinov, stated that the draft reply should first be distributed to the delegations for study before being discussed. The meeting was then adjourned at 11:30 AM to allow each delegation to review the document, with a resumption scheduled for 12:00 PM. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Brussels – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference, after adjourning at 11:30 AM, resumed its closed session at noon and concluded at 1:15 PM. It was decided to continue the meeting at 11:00 AM tomorrow. According to informed sources, the delegations submitted amendments to the draft reply to Japan to the secretariat of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The appointment of a smaller committee to negotiate with Japan will be decided after receiving the Japanese reply. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference also issued a statement stating, "Full sessions were held on the 4th and 5th of this month, during which the conference discussed a reply from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to the Japanese government's response to Belgium's invitation. The principles of the reply have been agreed upon by the conference, but the wording of the reply is currently being exchanged between the delegations." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Brussels – At this morning's Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Chairman Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister, immediately presented his draft reply to the Japanese government, which contained three points: ❶ Japan, in its reply to the invitation to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, acknowledges that the Nine-Power Treaty remains valid. Article One of the Nine-Power Treaty stipulates the integrity and political independence of China, therefore Japan should not take an opposing stance toward the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, which is consistent with the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty. ❷ The convocation of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, although after the resolution passed by the League of Nations' Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese problem, is an independent entity and it is necessary to convene it in order to deal with the Far Eastern situation. Even without the resolution of the Advisory Committee, it should still be convened. Moreover, the fact that the United States, a non-member of the League of Nations, and the Soviet Union, a non-signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty, are both attending the conference further proves the independent existence of the conference. ❸ If Japan accepts participation in the negotiations, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference intends to appoint a committee with only a small number of countries involved in the Far East to participate in the discussion, in order to satisfy Japan's wishes. The hope is that Japan will give favorable consideration to the conclusions, in order to determine whether it can contact China and the Nine-Power Treaty Conference under the above circumstances. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Brussels – The draft reply to the Japanese government, drafted by Chairman Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister, begins by stating, "In its reply to the Belgian government, the Japanese government stated that it has no territorial ambitions in China. On the contrary, the Japanese government sincerely hopes to find ways to assist the material and spiritual development of the Chinese nation, enhance cultural and economic cooperation between China and foreign countries, and respect the rights and interests of foreign countries in China. The above points are all fundamental principles stipulated in the Washington Nine-Power Treaty of February 6, 1922. The representatives of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty should take note of Japan's willingness to respect these principles. Furthermore, the Japanese reply denies violating the Nine-Power Treaty, arguing that since 1922, China has undergone significant changes due to the intrusion of communist forces and changes in the domestic situation. It also deeply criticizes China for implementing an anti-foreign policy, hindering Japanese economic activities, and endangering the lives of Japanese residents. The Nine-Power Treaty has already made provisions regarding this situation. Therefore, Article Seven of the treaty states that in the event of such a situation, the signatory countries may raise the issue and consult with each other. The current meeting in Brussels is convened based on the provisions of this article." In addition, the Japanese reply expresses objections, stating that the countries attending the Brussels Conference will be bound by the resolution of the League of Nations. Regarding this point, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference reply specifically responds, stating that "the representatives of the countries attending the Brussels Conference are exchanging opinions purely based on the Nine-Power Treaty." In its reply, Japan also raises objections to the fact that most of the countries participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have little connection to the Far East. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference reply points out that all signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty have the right to use the rights stipulated in the treaty. "However, the representatives of the countries attending the Brussels Conference believe that it is worthwhile to consider the Japanese government's desire to conduct discussions. This exchange of opinions can be conducted within the framework of the Nine-Power Treaty, and its main purpose is to clarify the above three key points and facilitate the resolution of the conflict between China and Japan." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Brussels – After Chairman Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister, read out the reply, Dr. Wellington Koo, the chief Chinese representative, stated that if the representatives believed that the Chinese delegation should withdraw in order for them to proceed with the discussion, he was willing to temporarily withdraw. Representative Koo also stated that the Chinese delegation did not wish to abandon its rights or evade its responsibility to participate in the conference. Italian representative Aloisi and Chairman Spaak both requested that he not withdraw, and the Chinese delegation remained at the meeting. If the Japanese reply is still good, then the negotiations between China and Japan and the subcommittee responsible for mediation will be lengthy and arduous. If the Japanese reply is rejected, the conference will have to return to square one and seek other methods of achieving a truce. According to an official spokesman, the result of today's meeting is extremely encouraging and the general discussion was beneficial. Based on the current situation, the reply to Japan will be redrafted. The draft will be submitted to the plenary session for approval next Monday. According to a statement issued by the Secretariat, certain documents had apparently been leaked to the newspapers. It also stated that any documents not officially published should not be considered accurate. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Brussels – Regarding the draft reply to the Japanese government drafted by Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, some at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference today advocated for the establishment of a drafting committee for a thorough discussion. Representatives from several countries suggested that the drafting committee should include only representatives from Britain, the United States, and Belgium. However, French Foreign Minister Delbos argued that France's interests in the Far East were extremely important and that France should not be excluded from any actions related to the Far East, thus requesting that France also participate in the drafting committee. As the various parties failed to reach a consensus on the composition of the drafting committee, it was finally decided that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference would revise the draft proposed by the Chairman. It was also decided that the delegations should submit any objections to the draft in writing to the secretariat of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference today, which would then compile and organize them into a more satisfactory new draft. This new draft would then be submitted to the plenary session tomorrow for decision. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Italian Representative Proposes Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations, Overruled by Representatives of the United States, Britain, and France</h3>
<p>Statement That All Countries Have the Right to Intervene in Far Eastern Issues; Decision to Establish Subcommittee to Undertake Mediation</p>
<p>Brussels – Under the leadership of the British, American, and French representatives, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference today decided in a two-hour secret session to organize a subcommittee to guide Japan to participate in reconciliation efforts. It is also heard that Germany will be invited to participate in the mediation efforts. When Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak made this proposal, Italian representative Aloisi immediately objected, arguing that the Sino-Japanese dispute should be resolved directly through negotiations between the two countries. American representative Davis then questioned Aloisi, "Does Italy mean that the participating countries have no right to intervene in the Sino-Japanese dispute?" British representative Eden and French representative Delbos unanimously supported Davis's question, and Aloisi's objection was thus dismissed. (April National Telegram)</p>
<p>Brussels – When the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and Soviet Russia held a meeting yesterday, U.S. Chief Delegate Davis, after forcefully refuting the suggestion of Italian Chief Delegate Count Aloisi, the assembly passed in principle the organization of a subcommittee, with the following tasks: ❶ To draft a reply to the Japanese response to the original invitation and memorandum from the Belgian government; ❷ To study the possibility of Japanese cooperation; ❸ Finally, to mediate the Sino-Japanese war. The Italian suggestion, which Davis sternly refuted, was that the subcommittee could suggest that China and Japan should begin direct negotiations. The U.S. representative then suddenly stood up and questioned Aloisi whether this meant that other countries had nothing to do with the Sino-Japanese dispute. Furthermore, the proposal to organize the subcommittee was put forward by U.S. Representative Davis after Chairman Spaak circulated the Japanese reply. Its purpose was to obtain Japan's cooperation. Spaak pointed out that the Japanese note acknowledged the existence of the Nine-Power Treaty, but raised several points that could be properly discussed. The British and French chief delegates, Eden and Delbos, immediately approved Davis’s proposal, and expressed that the subcommittee should mediate a Sino-Japanese truce. However, Davis also stated that even if Japan refused to attend, the conference should continue. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM, and King Leopold of Belgium hosted a tea party for the representatives of the various countries. It was originally intended to reconvene at 6 PM to discuss the number and organization of the subcommittee, but this was changed to reconvene at 10:30 AM this morning. It is heard that for the organization of the subcommittee, the representatives of Britain, the United States, and Belgium are all ex-officio members, but it is widely believed that if France joins the committee, Italy will inevitably rise up to fight for a seat. Today’s meeting therefore decided to postpone, so that the representatives of the various countries could thoroughly consult each other overnight. The next general assembly of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will be convened in about a week or ten days. It is generally expected that Japan will still refuse to participate in the conference, but some quarters believe that if the countries can acknowledge the various changes that have occurred in the Far East since the Washington Conference, such as the conquest of Manchuria, Japan may agree to cooperate. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Beijing – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference held a closed session at 2:30 PM this afternoon and adjourned at 4:15 PM. According to responsible sources, the representatives of the various countries, after discussing the matter, unanimously agreed to send a letter of application to the Japanese government, as proposed by the US representative, to respond to that country's note refusing to participate in the conference, and declared their willingness to serve as mediators between China and Japan. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is scheduled to continue its meeting at 10:30 AM tomorrow and will issue a communique at noon tomorrow, explaining the results of the meeting. The proceedings of today's meeting are recorded as follows: At the opening of today's meeting, Chairman Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister, first stated that Japan had not declared the Nine-Power Treaty abolished, which shows that there is still room for compromise. US Representative Davis then spoke, advocating that a letter of application be issued to the Japanese government again, urging it to take a compromising attitude. British Foreign Secretary Eden immediately endorsed it. French Foreign Minister Delbos, in addition to expressing his agreement, also proposed the establishment of a subcommittee to draft the letter of application and suggested that mediation be carried out between China and Japan. Regarding this, the representatives of the various countries had no objection. Only Italian representative Count Aloisi objected to granting the subcommittee broad powers, believing that negotiations should be conducted directly between China and Japan. French Foreign Minister Delbos then refuted this, stating that ❶ the countries concerned have an obligation to protect the interests they possess in the Far East; ❷ if those countries interfere in the Far Eastern disputes, this is in accordance with the provisions of Articles Seven and Eight of the Nine-Power Treaty. As a result, Italian Representative Aloisi did not insist and accepted granting the subcommittee broad powers. At this point, the representatives of the various countries proceeded to discuss the issue of the organization of the subcommittee. According to well-informed sources, there were two proposals at the time: ❶ The subcommittee should be composed of the seven countries: Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and the Netherlands. ❷ It should be composed of only the three countries: Britain, the United States, and Belgium. However, since France and Italy both possess significant interests in the Far East, they are bound to demand participation in the subcommittee. Therefore, the first method is more likely to be adopted. As for the proposal that only Britain and the United States should separately contact China and Japan, US Representative Davis has already rejected it. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>British and French Foreign Ministers Return Home Briefly</h3>
<p>Brussels – French Foreign Minister Delbos hastily returned to Paris at 9:40 this morning to meet with King George II of Greece. At today's Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the country's Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Taittinger, will attend as a representative. British Foreign Secretary Eden also needs to return to London briefly for personal matters and is scheduled to depart this afternoon on a British military aircraft. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Germany Reportedly Intends to Mediate Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Both China and Japan Deny; Strange Atmosphere in Tokyo</p>
<p>[Berlin] It was learned today that German leader Hitler has convened a meeting of several key party, government, and military figures to discuss the feasibility of Germany directly mediating the Sino-Japanese war. Those attending the meeting are said to be Defense Minister Blomberg, Foreign Minister Neurath, Aviation Minister Göring, and Navy Minister Raeder. However, the Chinese and Japanese embassies have strongly denied the claim of German mediation. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is currently being commented on by various newspapers, which unanimously say that reconciliation should be attempted. According to a telegram from a Daily News correspondent in Berlin, diplomatic circles here are rife with rumors that the German government is preparing to mediate. German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop will immediately negotiate with representatives from China and Japan to determine the intentions of each country. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Brussels – Regarding the rumors of Germany mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute, the spokesman for the Chinese delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference recently stated that the country's chief representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, has no knowledge of it. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Responsible persons here have recently solemnly denied external rumors that the German government is preparing to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. It is heard that these rumors originated because General Blomberg, the Minister of Defense, met with General Chiang Pai-li, a member of the Chinese National Defense Council, yesterday. Japanese figures here also made statements to a Havas News Agency reporter, stating that it is practically impossible for Germany to mediate. 'The current dispute is purely a matter between China and Japan. Interference from a third country, even if it is from a friend of Japan, is opposed.' In addition, Chinese figures here also stated that although there have been rumors of German mediation, China has no intention of accepting it. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] General Chiang Pai-li, a member of the Chinese National Defense Council, accompanied by Mr. Cheng Tien-fong, the country's ambassador to Germany, left for Brussels, Belgium today to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in the capacity of an observer. Chinese sources here have confirmed that General Chiang Pai-li will be received by Führer Hitler when he returns to Germany at a later date. The date is expected to be after the 9th of this month, the anniversary of the Nazi uprising. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese government officials today vigorously denied that Japan is moving towards peace, but it is also widely rumored outside that Japan is very willing to end the fighting in Shanghai. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to discuss the possibility of mediation and avoided the question of whether Japan's goals are territorial or ideological. Informed sources have also said that Japan feels that Hitler is easier to accept than Roosevelt as a mediator in the Far Eastern war. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Establishment of Japanese General Headquarters</h3>
<p>Military and Political Opinions United; Can Be Realized This Month</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The opinions within the Army Ministry regarding the plan to establish a General Headquarters in Japan to cope with the progress and end of the war have become consistent. On the government side, Prime Minister Konoe and other leaders are also understanding and have no objections. Furthermore, the Navy also agreed on the 4th. Therefore, on the issue of establishing the General Headquarters, the views of all parties concerned have now become consistent. The General Headquarters is organized according to military orders, and its content fully complies with the regulations of the wartime General Headquarters. It is clearly a purely command organization. The constituent members, such as the Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Naval General Staff, as well as senior subordinates in the staff and various agencies, are strictly limited to military personnel. Therefore, administrative officials such as the Prime Minister, various ministers, and the President of the Privy Council cannot serve as members of the General Headquarters. The Army and Navy Ministers will be responsible for liaison between the command and administrative departments. However, according to the precedents of the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, the Imperial Council meetings at the General Headquarters were attended by the Prime Minister, the President of the Privy Council, the Ministers of State, etc., who were specially appointed by imperial decree to participate in the planning. Therefore, there is a precedent to follow, so it is not impossible that the Imperial Council meetings this time may be handled in this way as well. In short, the General Headquarters is a purely command organization, and it has absolutely no relationship with the administrative organs. (Domei News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Hochi Shimbun stated today that the whole of Japan is now gradually approving the idea of Japan declaring war on China. Members of the Navy are also demanding a declaration of war, but the Army is actively opposing this, as it could easily provoke international disputes. After the Naval Ministry ceased its opposition, the establishment of the General Headquarters can be completed on November 10. Under this organization, the administrative powers of the government and the military will be merged into one, with the heads of the Army and Navy and their staff assisting the Emperor and the Grand Marshal in commanding everything. The two services will be the liaison personnel with the cabinet. Cabinet members and members of the Privy Council can only attend meetings of the General Headquarters under the special orders of the Emperor. The Asahi Shimbun recently published an article saying that if the Army and Navy consider the General Headquarters necessary for a long-term war against China, then the government should have no reason to oppose this organization. However, the Prime Minister should carefully handle the resulting reorganization of the cabinet. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Former Belgian Foreign Minister Ordered to Form Cabinet</h3>
<p>Brussels – After former Minister of Agriculture and Catholic Party Senator Pierlot failed to form a cabinet, King Leopold III entrusted former Foreign Minister Spaak with the task of forming a new cabinet. Spaak, who is currently the chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, is one of the leading figures of the Belgian Socialist Youth and enjoys a high reputation. His political views are more moderate than those of party leader Vandervelde. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>German Consulate General Issues Statement Denouncing False Rumors by Japanese Domei News Agency</h3>
<p>According to a solemn statement by German official sources in China, the Domei News Agency message of November 1st, claiming that the renowned German economist and former Chancellor Dr. Luther made the following declaration during a meeting with journalists at the German Consulate General in Tianjin: "Germany will cooperate closely with Japan to realize the plan to develop the economy of North China," is completely untrue. The above message is entirely a rumor fabricated by the Japanese to confuse public opinion. (Haitong News Agency) To the Editor of the Shen Bao: The article entitled "Germany, Italy, and the Far East Incident" published in your esteemed newspaper on the 3rd of this month contains the following statement: "The German financier Luther has arrived in Tianjin and made a statement to the Japanese Domei News Agency, advocating cooperation between Japan and Germany to develop North China. We hope that the news promoted by the Japanese side is completely fabricated…" Upon investigation, the item in question was indeed a free invention of Domei News Agency. The German Haitong News Agency issued a correction this morning. We are writing to you accordingly, hoping that you will refer to the correction issued by Haitong News Agency this morning to clarify the truth of the matter. With best regards, Acting Consul General Reinhardt, November 5, 1937.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Litvinov's Speech</h3>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov delivered a speech at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Beijing. The text is as follows: I am here to attend the conference at the invitation of the signatory countries of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations. I am deeply impressed by the grand arguments of the inviting parties, especially the American representative, regarding the Far Eastern incident. I do not find it necessary to issue a special statement here, especially since the issue currently before this conference is the same issue that was discussed in Geneva. Geneva is the source of this conference, and everything that should be said about the current situation has already been said in Geneva. As for the Soviet Union, whether regarding the general issue of opposing aggression as an international phenomenon, or the individual events that are active manifestations of such aggression, it has repeatedly stated its own views, and the opinions it has expressed have all stemmed from its concept of peace. This concept should also be the common starting point for most governments to establish a common stance, with the exception of a very few. The differences between countries only arise in the transition from a common concept to how to adopt the most effective measures to safeguard peace or to restore peace where it has been broken. In any case, if any measures are to be taken, the unavoidable first step must be joint discussions in international conferences or other organizations.</p>
<p>The convening of a conference to jointly discuss certain events is in itself an action with positive moral value. For this reason, I, on behalf of my government, congratulate this conference and express my deep gratitude to the Belgian government and its Foreign Minister, especially for their hard work in preparing for this conference and their warm hospitality to the delegations.</p>
<p>In recent years, international life has gained a valuable experience, which forces us to pay attention to the dangerous pitfalls and ruts that pervade the future of all international conferences. This experience tells us that international conferences, committees, and other organizations, although they have definite goals when they are convened, sometimes even forget their direct objectives and incidental tasks, and instead follow their own interests and exist for themselves, especially when their existence is prolonged. In such circumstances, such meetings often take maintaining their own existence, pursuing the moral satisfaction of their initiators and organizers, and pursuing their own superficial success as their main objectives. This superficial success does not always coincide with the success of the original purpose of convening the meeting. Sometimes these different interests even conflict. Sometimes, even conferences or committees convened for the purpose of eliminating and overcoming aggression openly become tools of the aggressors, and are used by them as smokescreens and aids for carrying out aggressive actions. This happens when these international organizations attempt to persuade the aggressors to change their attitude while also engaging with them.</p>
<p>In the process of repeatedly making concessions to aggressors through negotiations, people who originally had very noble intentions inevitably exceed the limits from time to time, unconsciously fall into the same views as the aggressors, and actually support and encourage their actions. If the issue concerns one country invading another, and this aggression has achieved some success, international organizations are very likely to say to the aggressors, for the sake of their own success, 'Take the loot you seized by force and be quiet from now on,' and to the victims of aggression, 'Do not resist evil, but be reconciled with your aggressor without discord.'</p>
<p>This may be the superficial success of the conference, but it is by no means a victory for peace, let alone a victory for peaceful nations. This kind of success only provokes new acts of aggression, creating the need to convene new conferences, and from then on, it will be an eternal cycle until the end of time.</p>
<p>When these international organizations deviate from the right path, they can create an environment that allows aggression to be further condoned and expanded. Because if international conferences are in this situation, friction will inevitably occur among peaceful nations, leading to division and conflict, which can be exploited by the aggressors. At a time when aggressors are increasingly colluding and jointly creating threats to most countries, it is especially necessary for peaceful nations to unite.</p>
<p>Any conference under current conditions is prone to such dangers, which I have specifically elaborated on. I only hope that this Beijing Nine-Power Treaty Conference, and the proposals that we will hear from the inviting countries, can be successful. I am convinced that the purpose of this conference will avoid the above-mentioned dangers, and that all proposals will not only restore peace in the Far East, but also restore a just peace, a peace that does not condone aggression but restrains it, a peace that extends far into the future and is universal to the world.

<h3>Fierce Bloody Battle on the Entire South Bank of the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Our troops in the western section are holding Zhujia Bang. The enemy reinforces and breaks through, attacking fiercely. The enemy landed yesterday at Jinshanwei and other places.</p>
<p>The center of the battle on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek is still in the western section of the Suzhou Creek, in the semicircular position west of Beixinjing to Shenjibang Estuary, and north of Piazzi Road, with Yaojia Zhai as the apex. After six days and nights of bloody battles and multiple secret crossings, the enemy has finally gained a foothold of about one square kilometer in this semicircular position on the south bank. The enemy and our troops are currently confronting each other across Zhujia Bang, and an extremely fierce bloody battle is still continuing. In order to prevent the enemy's forces from spreading, our army concentrated its firepower last night and charged fiercely towards the enemy in the rain. The enemy's foothold was unstable, and countless enemies were annihilated. The enemy has strongly occupied the villages of Wujia Ku, Tingtou, Caijia Zhai, Zhangjia Zhai, etc., and is currently busy deploying positions north of Zhujia Bang. In the eastern section of the Suzhou Creek, a small number of remnants of the enemy are entrenched near Liujia Zhai. Yesterday, the enemy took advantage of the cloudy and foggy weather and released smoke screens to cover up their secret crossing, sending in a large number of reinforcements and fiercely attacking our army's positions in Chichuan Xuejia She and other places. They advanced and retreated in turns, engaging in bloody battles all day long. Our army is currently holding the south bank of Xiaobang, confronting the enemy. Yesterday, a large number of enemy troops also attacked Jiangqiao Town and the Zhuyuan area, and fierce battles ensued. The enemy troops have been repelled head-on, and our army's positions have not changed at all. The enemy harassed everywhere. Yesterday at dawn, enemy ships gathered on the sea off Jinshanwei and densely bombarded the coast to cover their landing troops and invade our coastal area of Hangzhou Bay. The landing sites were at Caojing Town, Quan Gong Ting, and Jinshanwei, and the number of troops was not large. Our army has surrounded and severely suppressed them separately. Our artillery also sank one enemy ship.</p>
<h3>Main Force Battle Will Unfold</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army reported at 12:10 pm on the 5th that the battle for strongholds in the semicircular position in the western section of the Suzhou Creek, with Yaojia Zhai as its apex, has come to an end, and a main force battle will soon unfold. A part of our army that was surrounded between Tingtou and Zhang Zhai broke through the encirclement after a fierce battle last night and made contact with our main force. At the same time, our army in Tiandu Zhai, in coordination with a part of the army that was surrounded in Yaojia Zhai, attacked the enemy forces in the direction of Yujidun from inside and outside and broke through the enemy's positions, retreating to Tiandu Zhai as a whole, forming a solid line of defense and strictly preventing the enemy from expanding westward. As for the enemy forces surrounded by our army in Jiangjia Zhai, after repeated attacks by our army, many were annihilated, and half of the area has been recovered. The remaining forces will not be difficult to deal with.</p>
<h3>Enemy Twice Attacked Baziqiao, Repelled</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army reported at 8:40 pm on the 5th that after the enemy forces strongly occupied the strongholds of Wujia Ku, Tingtou, and Caijia Zhai at the protruding point in the western section of the Suzhou Creek, they deployed positions on the north bank of Zhujia Bang. This morning and in the evening, two attacks on our Baziqiao point were repelled. Our army inflicted a heavy blow on the enemy when they attempted to cross the river secretly, annihilating many enemies. Defensive fortifications have been strengthened to deal with the enemy. If the enemy attacks again, they will be severely hit.</p>
<h3>Secret Crossing at Chenjiadu Still Repelled</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency reported at 12:15 pm on the 5th that the enemy forces in the Chenjiadu area released smoke screens four times at 10 pm last night, 1 am, 2:30 am, and 4 am this morning, secretly crossing the river to reinforce the remnants of the enemy forces in Liujia Zhai on the south bank. However, our army was heavily guarded, and each time the enemy's foothold was unstable, they were attacked and repelled. The enemy had three pontoon bridges erected in that area, two of which were destroyed by our artillery fire. As for the remaining enemy forces hiding in Western-style buildings, more than 40 were annihilated by our forces yesterday.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Confront the Enemy Across Zhujia Bang</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency reported at 12:10 pm on the 5th that the enemy forces who attacked our Baziqiao last night were repelled after our brave resistance and several hand-to-hand combats until midnight. The enemy forces then constructed fortifications in Caijia Zhai and an unnamed small village to its west, confronting us across Zhujia Bang. After six days of bloody battles and multiple secret crossings, the enemy has finally gained a foothold of about one square kilometer on the south bank. Today, the enemy's artillery fire was concentrated on the area west of Beixinjing to Qujiaqiao for bombardment. In order to prevent the enemy's forces from spreading, our army also concentrated its firepower for a counterattack, setting a deadline to eliminate the enemy.</p>
<h3>Enemy Reinforcements in Liujia Zhai Fiercely Attack Chichuan Xuejia She</h3>
<p>The battle in the eastern section of the Suzhou Creek is gradually intensifying. Our army is now firmly holding the south bank of Xiaobang.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency reported at 8:40 pm on the 5th that in the area along the coast of Liujia Zhai, west of Hopeland Road on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, there are many scattered Western-style buildings. After the enemy forces crossed the river a few days ago and occupied them, they have built defensive fortifications. Although our army has continuously attacked and annihilated many enemies, it is a pity that they have not been completely eliminated. Today, the weather was cloudy and foggy, and the enemy forces used smoke screens again to cover up their secret crossing. Our army had already discovered it, but the firepower could not reach due to being blocked by the houses along the coast. As a result, two large battalions of them crossed the river one after another.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle at Chichuan Xuejia She</h3>
<p>After the enemy forces crossed the river, they dispersed to the left and right, first attacking Chichuan along the coast of Xiaobang, west of Liujia Zhai. Although our army fought bravely to resist, they were eventually broken through by the enemy due to their fierce artillery fire. At about 9 o'clock, our army launched a counterattack with reinforcements, launching a fierce assault. The enemy's foothold was unstable and they were driven back by us. After suffering this blow, the enemy changed their strategy again and attacked our Xuejia She point. The enemy set up small cannons in the Western-style buildings along the coast and bombarded us fiercely. The soldiers of our defending company were determined to coexist with the position and fought the enemy in close combat. In the end, they were almost all killed or wounded, and the enemy broke in, and a row of civilian houses at the eastern end of Xuejia She was lost.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle All Day, the Enemy Failed</h3>
<p>At nearly 11 am, fresh troops arrived and immediately launched a counterattack. Our army disregarded life and death, advanced in a bloody battle, broke through the enemy's positions, and recovered the area, surrounding a part of the enemy forces between Chichuan and Xuejia She. The enemy forces were panicked and fled in confusion, causing us to lose contact between the two places, and fell into a mixed battle. The position in Chichuan was lost again, but our army made persistent efforts, repeatedly attacking, and at about 2 pm, Chichuan was recovered again, and the fierce battle continued. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. By dusk, heavy rain poured down. Since the enemy had made no progress, they retreated to the area along the coast of Liujia Zhai to regroup. The battle then became silent. The enemy suffered a heavy blow and will certainly not be reconciled. Therefore, our army has deployed a large force in that area, and it is expected that the enemy will also send in a large number of reinforcements, and a more fierce battle will unfold.</p>
<h3>Our Army Firmly Holds the South Bank of Xiaobang</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency reported at 10:45 pm on the 5th that after the enemy forces reinforced the Liujia Zhai area, they built fortifications north of Xiaobang. At 2 pm, they divided their troops into two groups and attacked our positions in Beigongjia Zhai and Chen Geng, but they were all repelled by our army. We are now holding the south bank of Xiaobang, confronting the enemy.</p>
<h3>Two Regiments of Enemy Troops Attack Jiangqiao Town, Repelled</h3>
<p>Our army pursues and attacks Quan Chi fiercely. The enemy troops in Xin Muqiao suffered heavy casualties. Fierce fighting broke out on the Zhuyuan front line.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency reported at 12:15 pm on the 5th that at 3 am this morning, about two regiments of enemy troops attacked our forward guard positions in Jiangqiao Town from Gejia Xiang. Their left wing attacked our Jishen An, and their right wing occupied Quan Chi and attacked our Lijia Xiang. Our army responded calmly, taking both defensive and offensive measures. We dispatched a part of our forces to launch a counterattack along the Xiaobang from Lijia Xiang, carrying out a central breakthrough and cutting off the enemy's communication lines. The enemy's right-wing troops were threatened by us and retreated backward. Our army pursued and attacked Quan Chi fiercely. As of the time of the report, fierce fighting was still going on.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency said that the army learned that our army north of Guangfu had launched a successful assault on the enemy in Xin Muqiao, capturing many rifles and a mortar. A diary was also found on the bodies of the captured enemy soldiers. According to the diary, the enemy troops in the Xin Muqiao area belonged to the 58th Regiment of the 2nd Division, which had just been transferred from Nagoya to take over the defense. Their veteran soldiers had suffered heavy casualties, so the future of the team would be difficult to maintain for long.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency reported at 10:45 pm on the 5th that our army had a superior position on the Zhuyuan front line southeast of Jiangqiao Town. The enemy was guarding against our counterattack and concentrated many tanks on Zhennan Road. At 2 pm yesterday, they started a dense artillery battle, bombarding each other for a long time. The troops on both sides got closer and closer, and a fierce battle broke out. However, by 8 pm, there had been no changes in our position. Then, the sound of gunfire became sparse, and the battle stopped.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Invade the Coast of Hangzhou Bay, Landing at Jinshanwei and Other Places</h3>
<p>Caojing Town, Jinshanwei, Quan Gong Ting and other three places. The number of people is not large, and our army surrounds and suppresses them separately. Our artillery sank one enemy ship.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency reported at 8:40 pm on the 5th that enemy troops invaded the coast of Hangzhou Bay. At 4 am before dawn today, multiple enemy warships bombarded the Jinshanwei area to cover their marine corps, landing at Caojing Town, Jinshanwei, and Quan Gong Ting.

As of the time of the report, half of them had been eliminated, and the remaining half would not be difficult to deal with. At the same time, multiple enemy planes dropped bombs in the vicinity, but our losses were very small.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 8 am, two enemy planes flew southwest and, when passing Beiqiao, which belongs to the county, flew low and opened machine guns to strafe residents.

Also, at about 4 pm, when our western Shanghai positions were fiercely shooting at enemy planes, several anti-aircraft shells fell on Xieshi Road, Humin Road, and Caobin Road behind the Xiqin Institute in Caojing Town. Fortunately, the sky was dark and drizzling, and there were few pedestrians on the road, so there were no injuries or other incidents in various places.</p>
<p>West of Shanghai. The China Industrial Bank has 18 Western-style houses in a dormitory built at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Lincoln Road. The enemy planes fiercely bombed our Zhoujiaqiao area the night before last. The dormitory was hit by a bomb and was blown up.

<p>[Nanjing] Since the Lugouqiao Incident, for three months, Japanese troops in various parts of China have used airplanes and artillery to destroy our educational institutions at all levels, which are too numerous to mention. This is truly the most heinous atrocity committed by the Japanese and the greatest stain on the history of world civilization. Recently, prominent figures in China's education circles, such as Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University, Hu Shi, Professor of Peking University, Li Yuying, President of the Peiping Research Institute, Weng Zhirong, President of Tongji University, Zou Lu, President of Zhongshan University, Jiang Menglin, President of Peking University, Luo Jialun, President of National Central University, Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University, and Mei Yiqi, President of Tsinghua University, along with 102 others, jointly issued a lengthy statement of facts in English, exhaustively narrating Japan's destruction of our educational institutions. The first section is an introduction, and the second section describes the widespread destruction by the Japanese. It briefly states that from Peiping in the north to Guangzhou in the south, and from Shanghai in the east to Jiangxi in the west, 23 universities and specialized schools, and countless middle and primary schools have been destroyed by the Japanese. Taking universities as an example, the material losses, according to the 1935 estimates, amounted to more than 67 million yuan. The cultural losses, however, are incalculable. It is truly a case of China's thirty years of construction being insufficient to compensate for Japan's one day of destruction. The statement further describes that the Japanese actions were planned and systematic. For example, National Central University was designated as a bombing target by the Japanese air force and was subsequently bombed four times. Nankai University was not only bombed, but also burned down, leaving it completely scorched. The Japanese have often used military necessity as an excuse for these actions, but it is well known that these educational institutions are located in various places, often far from military areas, and have absolutely nothing to do with military affairs. The Japanese are intentionally destroying them precisely because they are educational institutions, and destroying them so that they cannot be rebuilt. All other explanations are mere excuses. Finally, they solemnly appeal to the people of the world, believing that the Japanese actions are a great threat to civilization and that enlightened people around the world should join with China in condemning them. If this threat cannot be stopped, there will be no progress or peace in the world. Moreover, hesitation is tantamount to encouraging the aggressor. Only by a global determination to implement effective sanctions can civilization be protected in the simplest and fastest way. The entire text is very long and describes the situation in detail. It is said that it will soon be printed into a book for widespread dissemination. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 5th)</p>

<h3>Plenary Session of the Non-Intervention Committee on Spain</h3>
<p>Resolution Proposed by Subcommittee Passed, Preparations to Send Personnel to Investigate Withdrawal of Volunteers</p>
<p>[London] The Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War held a plenary session at 4:00 PM, which concluded at 5:50 PM. The resolution proposed by the subcommittee was unanimously passed, and the chairman, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth, was entrusted to draft a note on the issue of sending an international investigation team to Spain to prepare for the withdrawal of foreign volunteers. The note will be submitted by British Foreign Secretary Eden to both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War. Once both parties have submitted their answers, the subcommittee will convene a meeting to discuss them. In addition, the Adjustment Committee decided to entrust the subcommittee to continue studying the following issues: ① the restoration of surveillance measures; ② the withdrawal of foreign volunteers; ③ the recognition of belligerent status. Negotiations on these issues will be conducted diplomatically between the countries concerned. At today's meeting, Chairman Lord Plymouth first presented the resolution passed by the subcommittee and the compromise plan proposed by the United Kingdom on July 14 for discussion. Italian representative Grandi immediately stated that ① regarding the issue of sending an international investigation team, Italy agreed that Britain should contact both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War; ② regarding the British compromise plan, Italy proposed a reservation, saying, "The points contained in the British plan are all interconnected. All countries except the Soviet Union have accepted it. In addition, the Soviet Union has also decided to waive its right to vote on the issue of recognizing belligerent status. All of these factors have a significant impact. Regarding the former, if the Soviet Union does not change its attitude, and regarding the latter, if the countries cannot agree on various countermeasures, then the Adjustment Committee will have no way to implement the British compromise plan." He also said that if the Soviet Union refuses to recognize the Spanish National Army as a belligerent party, the Adjustment Committee should provide the National Army with compensatory measures, but Grandi did not specify the nature of these measures. German representative Walman and the representatives of Austria-Hungary, Portugal, and Albania spoke successively, and their views were largely the same as those of the Italian representative. At this point, French representative Corbin declared that the parties to the Spanish Civil War could only be recognized as having certain belligerent rights after the implementation of measures to withdraw foreign volunteers. Regarding the issue of surveillance measures, France is prepared to restore surveillance measures in the Pyrenees Mountains, but only on the condition that surveillance measures are also restored on other land borders in Spain. Conversely, if any other country violates the non-intervention agreement, especially if the British compromise plan, especially the measures for the withdrawal of volunteers, cannot be implemented within a reasonable time limit, then the surveillance measures in the Pyrenees Mountains should not be maintained. Soviet representative Maisky said that if foreign volunteers can be withdrawn in large numbers, and if there are no further deployments to Spain in the future, then the Soviet Union may agree to discuss the issue of recognizing belligerent status. "I have received instructions from the government to accept the subcommittee's resolution, but with a reservation, namely, waiving the right to vote on the issue of recognizing belligerent status." It is hoped that the Soviet Union's position can enable the work of withdrawing volunteers to continue and be completed successfully. The Adjustment Committee then adjourned. It is generally believed that no difficulties will arise regarding the dispatch of an international investigation team to Spain, because the members of the investigation team who are of German or Italian nationality will not be accepted by both sides if they are sent to the territory controlled by the Republican government, and those of Soviet nationality will not be accepted if they are sent to the territory controlled by the National Army.

<p>[London] Regarding the British government's plan to send officials to Salamanca, Spain, to protect British nationals and commercial interests, Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that the government would hold talks with the Spanish National Army authorities to discuss the mutual dispatch of officials, but these officials would not have diplomatic representative status. The British government has not changed its attitude towards the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War, but the government is concerned about the protection of British nationals and commercial interests in the territory controlled by the Spanish National Army, and the progress of the negotiations on this matter has been communicated to France at any time. Opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee asked whether this move was tantamount to de facto recognition of the National Army government. The Prime Minister replied, "No." Labour MP Alexander asked whether it was true that the government intended to appoint Sir Hogeson, the former British Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, as the official in Salamanca. The Prime Minister replied that the selection of candidates had not yet been decided. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<h3>US President's Expectations for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>A Test of Whether Britain, France, and the United States Can Cooperate, Quezon Plans to Open a Free Port in Manila</p>
<p>Brussels: Representatives of various countries here today deeply believe that US President Roosevelt will use the Nine-Power Treaty Conference as a touchstone for whether he can obtain the cooperation of Britain and France in opposing the fascist bloc. Because President Roosevelt stated in his Chicago speech that the United States is prepared to isolate aggressor countries and cooperate with various countries to maintain world peace, it is generally speculated that the current attitude of the United States is actually to test whether Britain and France are prepared to cooperate with the United States to seek a solution to this major world peace issue, and at the same time to test the reaction of American public opinion. Therefore, representatives of various countries believe that the outcome of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will not only shift US foreign policy but also be of great significance to world security. Judging from the fact that the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Russia unanimously spoke at the meeting in support of the proposals of US representative Davis, it can be seen that this test has already yielded considerable results. (National Telegraph dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Philippine President Quezon, in view of the prolonged Shanghai War affecting the commerce of various countries in Shanghai, has proposed opening Manila as a free port in the East and expressed his willingness to cooperate fully with merchants from various countries in transferring the major commercial centers in Shanghai to Manila. Officials and business people here today are very excited about Quezon's proposal and very happy to accept it. American business people believe that Quezon's proposal is sufficient to solve the problem of American commercial development in the East, even if the Japanese continue their military operations in Shanghai indefinitely, American commerce will not be affected. According to general observation, if Manila is opened as a free trade port, it will not be able to compete with Hong Kong, because in fact, Hong Kong's shipping is far above Manila's. But in any case, Manila can earn a batch of commerce from Shanghai, China, especially with faster transportation, enough to overcome all geographical obstacles. The International Trade Conference in Cleveland is paying special attention to this issue and will specifically discuss the commercial and business prospects of the Philippines. It is reported that many large American merchants are actively participating in this conference. New York has also expressed excitement about the proposal to open Manila as a commercial port in the East to replace Shanghai and is currently estimating the benefits and prospects after this transfer.

<h3>International Women's League for Peace and Freedom</h3>
<p>Requests a Conference to Stop the War</p>
<p>[Geneva] The International Women's League for Peace and Freedom today sent a letter to the chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, former Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, requesting that the governments of the participating countries stop the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible, and when necessary, immediately take systematic measures in the spiritual, economic, and financial aspects to deal with the aggressor government. However, the measures adopted by various countries to stop the war should be in accordance with the principles of China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and should not allow the aggressor country to benefit instead. In other words, Japan should not be allowed to annex the land it has occupied. The areas occupied by the Japanese army since the Lugouqiao Incident in China on July 7 this year should be withdrawn. In addition, if a fair and just solution to the Sino-Japanese problem is to be achieved, China's sovereignty in the three northeastern provinces cannot but be restored.

<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Shanghai Shipping</h3>
<p>Conservative MP Asks About Difficulties</p>
<p>[London] Conservative MP Molem mentioned the difficulties currently experienced by British shipping in Shanghai in the House of Commons today and asked the Board of Trade whether it was aware of the serious impact on British merchants in Shanghai due to the high cost of war risk insurance for ships going to Shanghai. Wallace, Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, replied that he had heard that insurance companies were willing to underwrite war risk and cargo insurance for ships heading to Shanghai and their non-military cargo, limited to the time the cargo was on board. However, he had heard that insurance companies were currently considering relaxing the time limit to help shipping companies. Molem also asked whether the Board of Trade could inform British shipping companies that if they delayed sending ships to Wusong, British trade would suffer greatly. The Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in Shanghai had recently issued a notice designating safe locations and times for British ships to dock, and there was a barge service between Shanghai and Wusong, so shipping companies should not feel any difficulties. All of these points could be brought to the attention of shipping companies. Wallace replied that whether or not to send ships to Wusong was a matter to be decided by the shipping companies. When making this decision, shipping companies would of course consider factors such as the safety of ships and cargo and the amount of business.

<h3>US's Two Major Labor Unions Reconcile and Make Peace</h3>
<p>[Washington] The American labor movement is divided into two factions: the Congress of Industrial Organizations, led by Lewis, and the American Federation of Labor, led by Green. These two organizations recently passed resolutions to boycott Japanese loans. Today, representatives of the two organizations met for a long time and held negotiations to reconcile with each other and no longer be hostile. The issues discussed were: ① whether to expand the reconciliation negotiations; ② to establish a subcommittee to reconcile the disputes between the two sides; ③ which industries should have labor unions. This is the first attempt at division and reunion in the American labor movement. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<h3>Five Girls' Middle Schools in This City Telegraph Our Representatives in Beijing, Urging Them to Persist to the End</h3>
<p>Hoping Not to Accept Any Mediation, Asking Representatives of Various Countries to Respect the Treaty</p>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty signatory countries' conference has already opened in Beijing. Students from five girls' middle schools in this city, including China Girls' Middle School, Shanghai Girls' Middle School, Minli Girls' Middle School, Kunfan Girls' Middle School, and Daozhong Girls' Middle School, jointly telegraphed our representatives Gu Weijun and others yesterday, urging them to persist to the end. The original telegram stated: "To the representatives attending the Nine-Power Treaty: We are the students of Shanghai Girls' Middle School. In the enemy's bombing, we are all still studying in the academy. But when you attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, although we are in the academy, although we are in the classroom, our hearts are always concerned about you. Although we can deeply believe that you will not sign a treaty with the enemy that damages the country's territory, administration, and sovereignty, in order to enable our representatives to understand our will and to persist to the end, we make the following requests to you: ① Ask the representatives of various countries to uphold justice; ② Ask the representatives of various countries to respect the contents of the treaty and maintain the integrity of our country's territory and administrative sovereignty; ③ Please persist to the end and do not accept any conditions of mediation, unless the Japanese army withdraws from Shanghai and North China and returns the entire Northeast Four Provinces to us. We most sincerely hope that you will convey our opinions to the conference and live up to our expectations." Sincerely, students of Shanghai China Girls' Middle School, Shanghai Girls' Middle School, Minli Girls' Middle School, Kunfan Girls' Middle School, and Daozhong Girls' Middle School.</p>
<h3>Japan Fears "Boycott"</h3>
<p>American Bird Tottley Writes, Special Translation of Anglo-American Economic Weapons Can Stop Wars</p>
<p>World figures are now suggesting "boycott" as a technique to curb Japan's aggression in China. This "boycott" is indeed effective, because Japan has more vulnerable economic weaknesses than even Italy. Furthermore, Italy engaged in the conquest of Abyssinia after more than a decade of tranquility, nurturing its strength. What about Japan? It is already exhausted from suppressing 30 million people in Manchuria and consolidating its puppet state to guard against the Soviet Union. Then it attempts to conquer China. How easy is that? The difference between conquering Abyssinia and conquering China, where the whole country is united and determined to resist at any cost, is like heaven and earth.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1937, Japan's excess of imports over exports was greater than the total for the year of the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1924, almost reaching the total for the entire year of 1936. Even before the outbreak of war, exports were only two-thirds of imports. Because Japan lacks foreign investment, it has no way to make up for the trade deficit, so it can only ship out its already insufficient gold reserves to make ends meet.</p>
<p>The reason for Japan's huge trade deficit in 1936 and 1937 is not only the large quantities of metals and machinery needed for military procurement programs, but also the reduction in profits gained during the era of cheap raw materials since 1932, when labor costs were extremely low. In the last two years, the prices of cotton and wool worldwide have soared, and the cost of goods has risen accordingly. Therefore, last year, the quantity and value of Japanese textiles exported began to decrease and were becoming increasingly difficult to compete with and win.</p>
<p>The British Empire currently absorbs 18 percent of Japan's exports and supplies 31 percent of Japan's imports. The United States (excluding the Philippines) absorbs 22 percent and supplies 32 percent. Therefore, the British Empire and the United States together absorb half of Japan's exports and supply 63 percent of Japan's needs. Furthermore, the United States alone purchases 85 percent of Japan's exported raw silk. Raw silk is Japan's only export that does not rely on imported raw materials. In practical terms, Japan's entire social structure depends on the American silk market.</p>
<p>Japan's indispensable imports are oil from the United States and the Dutch East Indies, and iron and scrap iron from India, Malaya, and Australia. Although the Japanese Empire imports iron sand from abroad, its pig iron production, including Manchuria, reached a maximum of only 2.9 million tons in 1936. In that year, Britain produced 8 million tons, and Germany reached as high as 15 million tons. In 1936, Japan's steel production, including Manchuria, was only 5.5 million tons, while Britain had 11.8 million tons, and Germany had 6.2 million tons more than Britain. Japan's coal consumption is only one-fifth of Britain's. Japan's heavy industry is not as developed as its light industry. Japan cannot even manufacture cars itself, and many kinds of machinery must be supplied by Western countries.</p>
<p>Japan's main weakness in war is that its farmland is still cultivated using primitive methods, relying on animal power, and agricultural machinery is almost unknown. Therefore, although the yield per acre is high, the yield per person is extremely low. The hard work of a farming family throughout the year, even in peacetime, can only support their own family and two other families. Therefore, after transferring huge numbers of men from the agricultural areas into the army and women into factories manufacturing munitions, agricultural production will plummet. On the one hand, hundreds of thousands of troops stationed abroad must be continuously supplied with food, which will consume much more than when they were farming.</p>
<p>Japan has always relied on financial assistance from Western countries in every real war with foreign countries. Today, Japan's financial position is much worse than in any previous era of adversity. At the end of last year, it had to gradually lean towards currency inflation as a temporary measure. In April of this year, the prices of various goods sold at retail were almost double what they were before the abandonment of the gold standard in December 1931, although wages have fallen. Metal prices have risen by 76 percent since 1936, and textiles and fuels have also risen by 25 percent, while retail prices have risen by 30 percent. As a result, in the first four months of this year, strikes broke out everywhere due to difficult living conditions, reaching a record high. The large difference between the increase in retail and wholesale prices clearly indicates the difficult situation of small business owners and artisans.</p>
<p>The cost of living in Japan, even before this war, was increasing rapidly, largely due to the fact that Japan's budget proposals over the years have been in deficit. Since the Manchurian Incident, the deficit in the budget proposal has always been made up by raising debt, and the deficit has increased year by year. According to official estimates, this year's national expenditure will reach 2.872 trillion (each trillion is a million) yen, while regular income is only slightly more than 1.5 trillion yen. New debt supplies 965 trillion yen, and taxes supply 1.313 trillion yen, while the new expenses for the war against China are almost 5.5 trillion yen. It is estimated that income from taxes and national monopolies is currently less than one-third of expenditure. Another thing to note is that military spending is estimated based on a short-term war. It is estimated that the national income of the whole country in 1936 (according to the Mitsui Economic Research Institute) was only 13 trillion yen. National debt reached 11 trillion yen at the end of last year, while national expenditure was as high as 5.5 trillion yen. The significance of that is imaginable. The average annual income of each Japanese citizen is less than 200 yen, and the state now wants to take 40 percent of it. The instability of Japan's social system is the same as its economy. About half of the people are engaged in agriculture. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>General Plan for Establishing a Refugee Zone in Nanshi Drawn Up</h3>
<p>Based on the Principle of Not Involving Political Negotiations, Police Authority and Order Are the Responsibility of Our Side</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of establishing a refugee zone in Nanshi, according to information obtained by this reporter from relevant parties, the relevant parties in Britain, the United States, and France are continuing to negotiate this matter, and it is expected that it will be realized in the near future. The motivation for this matter is entirely due to the fact that since the August 13th War of Resistance, the refugee areas in the concession area of this city have been filled with refugees who have no way to be accommodated. Therefore, the diplomatic authorities of the three countries in Shanghai, Britain, the United States, and France, and charitable organizations, specifically suggested to our municipal government that a portion of Nanshi be designated to accommodate as many war zone refugees as possible to maintain humanity. However, this matter will not harm our side's territorial sovereignty in the slightest. It is purely a refugee relief nature between countries. That is, after this matter matures, the security of the entire area will still be the responsibility of the police dispatched by our side, and no agreement will be signed. As for the location of the land and the matters of presiding over relief, it will be decided after detailed consultation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the matter of establishing a refugee zone in Nanshi is now being actively promoted and will be established within a week. A reporter from the National Society visited a Westerner who initiated this matter yesterday to inquire about the progress of this matter. He was received and spoke in great detail about the development process and progress of this matter. He said that after the Shanghai War broke out, the war zone refugees were displaced and homeless, which was eye-catching. The concession area could not accommodate them, and most Westerners in this city were heartbroken to witness this. They discussed establishing a refugee zone outside the concession area to accommodate them. After many contacts, it has gradually become concrete, but this matter is of great importance and cannot be accomplished by the power of a few people. Therefore, it was decided that the consuls of various countries and enthusiastic Chinese and foreign people would jointly organize an international relief committee (not the International Relief Association) to take full responsibility for relief and other matters. The police authority in the area will still be the responsibility of the police dispatched by China. Once the war is over, it will be cancelled immediately. The progress of this matter is quite smooth. Once it is contacted with a certain party again, it can be formally established, and the date is about within a week.</p>
<h3>Map of the Refugee Area in Nanshi Under Consideration</h3>
<h3>The Entire City of Zhabei Is Almost Reduced to a Scorched Earth</h3>
<p>The Enemy Set Fire to It, a Miserable Sight, Few Undestroyed Houses</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, in addition to a portion of the houses in Zhabei being destroyed by enemy aircraft bombs and large cannons, the rest were set on fire by enemy soldiers after they occupied Zhabei on the morning of October 27th. Now, everywhere is a scene of broken walls and ruins, a miserable sight, which makes people sigh. Only the Guangfu Road area on the border of the Chinese Concession has a portion of shops and houses that have not been destroyed. The details of the investigation are recorded as follows: The roof and windows of the Continental Bank's vault on the north bank of the New Garbage Bridge and the cannon holes on the west wall of the Four Banks Warehouse connected to Kunshan were still smoking last night. The First Warehouse of the Jiangsu Bank facing west has been completely burned down. The Fuyuan and Fukang Joint Warehouse and the Bank of Communications Warehouse, the Meikang Printing Press, the Renchang Grocery Store (Yongdeli), the Shanghai-Taizhou Automobile Company, and the Suifeng Rice Mill are all intact. From the west of the Wuzhen Road Bridge to the Xinza Bridge, only the Tongkang Heng Nanhua Store has not been destroyed, because that place is a rice wharf, and all the rice shops have been completely burned down. The rice shops at the Pingba Ferry Crossing west of Xinguang Bridge (i.e., Huasheng Road), such as Dachang, Yuyuan, Changan Road intersection, Nanchuan Official Salt Zhabei Branch, Qingsheng, Rentai, Defeng, Yuanfeng, various rice shops, Minyi Rice Mill, Yuda, Juxing, Yongshun, Tong Shen, Hongchang, Tongxing Yong, and Gongda Rice Shop, Yixing Sack Shop, Fuxin First Flour Mill, Hengkang Rice Mill, and Taichang Rice Shop are all preserved. Along the way from the west of Huasheng Road to the Meiyuan Road intersection, except for the Huanan Coal Ball Factory, which has not been destroyed, the rest have been reduced to ashes. The entire city of Guanbei is almost reduced to a scorched earth. Furthermore, near the Wuzhen Road Vegetable Market and the southern end of Hengfeng Road, the fire rekindled twice in succession from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The current fires are all self-ignited and self-extinguished.</p>

<h3>German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact</h3>
<p>—宜</p>
<p>The German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact will be formally signed in Rome today. According to foreign電所transmitted by外電所. However, it is aimed at exchanging information on the activities of the Comintern and has no meaning of a military alliance. However, when world peace countries are deeply concerned about the wars in China and Spain. The announcement of the agreement between the three countries is also enough to reflect the common military intentions of Germany, Italy, and Japan.</p>
<p>It has long been clear that Germany, Italy, and Japan, due to their lack of self-國 resources, want to launch a war to redistribute the world. They raised the banner of "anti-communism" to use it as a smokescreen for war behavior. Litvinov said that the term "anti-communism" has the meaning of geology mineralogy涵涵涵. This seems to be a bit sarcastic. In fact, it is very appropriate. Can't we already see from the bloody reality. Are the coal mines, iron mines, cotton fields, and salt fields in northern China and the copper mines and zinc mines in Spain all related to "anti-communism"?</p>
<p>Of course. In the view of the authorities of the three countries. The pleasant term "anti-communism" can win the sympathy of other capitalist countries to some extent. However, the terrible actions that follow this term have not only made this sympathy impossible, but have also made other countries very disgusted with this kind of ideological movement. Because other countries are天at accelerating domestic unity to protect themselves. The anti-communist movement only causes domestic disasters.</p>

<h3>All Sectors Enthusiastically Encourage the Subscription of Public Bonds</h3>
<p>National Postal Workers Encourage the Subscription of Public Bonds</p>
<p>Since the government issued national salvation public bonds, the National Postal Workers' General Union immediately resolved that postal workers nationwide would subscribe to public bonds according to their salary rates, totaling approximately three million yuan. Recently, to actively promote the sale of public bonds, the union issued a circular to postmen nationwide, urging them to mobilize and encourage subscriptions. The text of the circular is as follows: "Since the government issued national salvation public bonds, the national populace has subscribed enthusiastically. However, the subscriptions are still far from the set amount. Our postmen comrades are numerous and their footprints are all over the country. Moreover, they have close relationships with people from all walks of life and good rapport. If postmen are tasked with encouraging subscriptions, the results will surely be considerable. According to a report from the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, its postmen members have sold more than 200,000 yuan in national salvation public bonds in a mere ten days. The method involves the authorities distributing national salvation public bonds to the postmen, 50 yuan to each person at a time. After daily reporting and selling, they continue to receive supplements based on the amount sold. For example, if 30 yuan of public bonds are sold, in addition to submitting the 30 yuan in cash, they continue to receive 30 yuan of public bonds to make up the amount of 50 yuan. This method is simple, easy to implement, and highly effective. Therefore, we hereby instruct the unions in all localities to contact and handle this with the local subscription promotion agencies, and to further instruct the postmen members to mobilize and work hard to encourage subscriptions. This matter concerns the vital plan to save the nation. You must comply and report the handling situation at any time."</p>
<p>First and Second Special Districts Use Rent to Purchase Bonds</p>
<p>The First Special District Team of the National Salvation Public Bonds Citizen Subscription Promotion Corps held its third plenary meeting of directors and team leaders yesterday. The resolutions were as follows: ① Actively continue to encourage subscriptions to national salvation public bonds and national salvation savings; ② Promote the purchase of public bonds with rent: A. Recommend that the general association clearly stipulate methods for purchasing public bonds with rent to actively promote this; B. Send letters to the trust departments of various banks and the real estate industry association to investigate the actual situation of real estate in the district; C. Issue a letter to tenants, enthusiastically implementing the rent-for-public-bonds movement; ③ Team leaders of each team should maintain close contact with the deputy team leaders and detachment leaders of their team to increase the effectiveness of subscription promotion. Finally, the attending directors and team leaders reported and submitted their subscription promotion results separately.</p>
<p>The Sixth and Eighth District branches of the Citizens' United Association of the Second Special District of this city sent letters to the landlords in their districts yesterday regarding the purchase of public bonds with rent, requesting them to implement it voluntarily. The original letter is excerpted below: "Sir/Madam, Since the government issued national salvation public bonds, all sectors of this city have organized subscription promotion teams and worked hard to encourage subscriptions. At this time of full-scale resistance, striving for national independence and the survival of the nation, it is time to sacrifice one's family to relieve the nation's difficulties. Therefore, the subscription results of each team have been considerable in a short period of time. According to recent reports, your trade association has resolved to use one month's rent to purchase public bonds, entrusting the tenants to pay through the collecting bank and exchange the receipt for a rent ticket. This shows your patriotic enthusiasm, and we deeply admire your good intentions and beautiful methods. It is heard that the landlords of Hua'e Fang have long-term rent payments to purchase public bonds until the end of the war. Their patriotic sincerity is a model for landlords throughout the city. Other neighborhoods have also automatically implemented it on many occasions. Our association has now received inquiries from tenants in various neighborhoods in the district regarding the implementation methods, and requests that the owners be contacted to assist in the process. This matter concerns national salvation and survival, and should be assisted. In addition to printing and distributing the purchase methods to be promoted by the tenants, we have always admired your patriotism and you are never lagging behind. We hereby write to you to check, approve assistance, and hope to reply to facilitate the process."</p>

They meet the regulations for requesting construction articles." A telegram was received from the Jiangnan branch stating: "Yan Huiyu and businessman Ding Hualong have each purchased 10,000 yuan of bonds, and the funds have been paid in full.

<p>The Business Sector Promotion Team of National Salvation Public Bonds received a letter from Huahua Silk Company yesterday stating: "In view of the fact that strengthening the national power at the beginning of the war of resistance is the most important plan at present, and in order to implement the spirit of long-term resistance, in addition to subscribing to national salvation public bonds according to the capital amount of the silk industry team, it is planned to completely renovate the general company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road to contribute to the country and use it to subscribe to public bonds. The method is that the company will issue a list, send it to the general team for personnel to check and collect, fairly assess the price, and openly solicit contractors to weave the fabric, and the proceeds will be used to subscribe to public bonds."</p>
<p>Women's Team Leaders and Secretaries Joint Meeting</p>

<h3>Several Important Issues in the North China War Situation</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhonghua</p>
<p>In recent days, the development of the North China war situation has reached a new and serious stage. In northern Shanxi, the enemy forces were blocked by us in the Xinkou mountain area for three weeks. Now, the enemy forces have suddenly broken through our defenses and advanced to Xinxian. Our troops have retreated to Shilingguan. In eastern Shanxi, the enemy forces have again captured Yangquan and are pressing on Shouyang. The progress of the enemy forces on these two fronts has placed Taiyuan in a very urgent situation. The battle situation in eastern Shanxi is closely related to the military situation on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines. If our troops were to advance north along these two lines to launch a counterattack, the enemy forces attacking west along the Zhengtai Railway would certainly feel the danger to their rear and would have to halt their advance. However, although there have been repeated reports in recent days of a counterattack by our troops on these two fronts, in reality, the battle lines along both sides of the Zhanghe River and the Tuohai River have not changed much. Not only that, but the enemy forces on the Pinghan Railway have also captured Zhangde on the south bank of the Zhanghe River, which has also increased the seriousness of the situation in northern Henan. We believe that this development in the western and northern theaters of war is infinitely more serious than the movement of a small part of the battle line in the eastern theater of war, and we must not take it lightly in the slightest.</p>
<p>North China is the arena where we and the enemy will fight to the death, and Shanxi in particular is a key strategic location, as everyone knows. Therefore, many people have long pointed out that holding Shanxi and launching counterattacks on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines are two key steps to save the North China war situation. In the past few weeks, the enemy forces were mostly blocked at Xinkou, and the enemy transportation lines near Yanmenguan and Pingxingguan were cut off by our guerrillas. On the Pinghan and Jinpu lines, there have been repeated reports of counterattack progress, indicating that our strategy on these two fronts is unfolding step by step. But in this sudden change, why have such unfavorable situations been created in northern Shanxi, eastern Shanxi, and the Pinghan line? And what impact will this development have on the future prospects of the North China war situation? If the impact is quite serious, how will we further remedy it? These important issues must now be carefully examined.</p>
<p>We believe that the current reversal of the Shanxi war situation is not due to any strategic errors in the western theater, but is mainly affected by the northern theater. The fall of Shijiazhuang allowed the enemy to attack Niangziguan, threatening eastern Shanxi. Now that the enemy forces on the Zhengtai Railway are attacking fiercely to the west, northern Shanxi is naturally also affected. However, from the perspective of military development, the operations of our army on the Pinghan line are definitely not lacking in courage. The failure in this area is still due to two other reasons: one is that in this area, although our main forces can hold the front line and fight to the death, the flanks lack the coordination of mobile guerrillas and cannot contain the enemy's flanks and rear. Therefore, the fall of Shijiazhuang was due to the enemy crossing the Tuotuo River in Yecheng and attacking our rear. The abandonment of Niangziguan was due to the enemy breaking through Gu Guan, forcing us to retreat quickly. Another reason is that there is still a lack of coordination on several fronts in North China. For example, when the enemy concentrated its forces to attack eastern Shanxi, the enemy's reinforcements on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines were empty, but we failed to counterattack in time. This is especially obvious on the Jinpu line. In the past few days, the enemy forces have transferred a portion west to the Pinghan line and eastern Shanxi, and a portion north to Shanhaiguan to defend Manchuria. The enemy forces in front of the Jinpu line are only 2,000 people, and the rest are mostly puppet troops. At this time, we did not counterattack Cangxian and Dezhou from northern Shandong, but instead watched as the enemy forces in eastern Shanxi launched a full-scale attack. This is truly a major strategic oversight. This situation may be due to the fact that the several railways in North China have become unconnected vertical lines, so each line has become an independent combat unit. Perhaps there are other reasons as well. But we see that the enemy has used the advantages of the northern theater to make up for the failure of the western theater, and has used the lack of strong resistance on the Jinpu line to help break through our defenses on the Pinghan line. It can be seen that the enemy's operations on several fronts are mutually coordinated. The temporary setbacks of our army can be said to be due to this strategic oversight.</p>
<p>However, we believe that this temporary reversal of the situation will not cause a major adverse impact on the entire North China war situation. This can be seen from the fact that our army's courage to resist is only stronger than before. At the same time, in the speeches of our highest military and political authorities, it has been repeatedly pointed out that even if we retreat to the Yellow River line, we can still resolutely resist. It can be seen that the movement of these one or two defense lines will absolutely not affect our plan to resist to the end. In particular, we know that at present, if the enemy wants to attack Taiyuan, it must still cross the Shilingguan in the north and the mountainous area around Shouyang in the east. To the southwest of Taiyuan, there is still half of Shanxi. In the overlapping mountains, many defense lines can be deployed to prevent the enemy's advance.</p>
<p>However, at the moment, after a reversal of the situation, it is also very important that we do our best to remedy it militarily. This, of course, is already being considered and quickly arranged by our military and political authorities. If we want to put forward a few special points of attention, then strengthening the unified command of the military in North China, so that the development of several battle lines can be coordinated, is the most important thing. Furthermore, a broader coordination of main force warfare and guerrilla warfare, so that it is not limited to northern Shanxi, is also very necessary. In addition, we should politically guarantee the rights of the ethnic minorities in our northwestern border, so that they will not be instigated and used by the enemy. This is also worth noting. We must know that if the enemy is able to reach the Yellow River and control the situation in Shanxi, their aggression will never stop, but will continue to advance westward and continue to expand their boundless ambitions. The Chinese proverb 'After acquiring Long, one desires Shu' coincides with the enemy's invasion plan. Therefore, in any case, we must give the enemy the most violent blow in every advance. In particular, we must use the lessons of failure to quickly remedy the shortcomings of the past military, strengthen the strength of the operation, and sweep the enemy out.</p>
<h3>General Liao Talks About the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Heroic Sacrifices Demonstrate Vigorous Morale, Charge Forward to Strive for Final Victory</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: After struggling through muddy mountain trails in the desolate autumn scenery, and walking for about two or three hours, we finally arrived safely at our destination. There, we met General Liao, who led tens of thousands of brave soldiers on a long journey to participate in the war in the eastern theater. He has a burly physique, a tall stature, and even more so, a resolute and courageous spirit, and a kind and approachable attitude, fully revealing his noble and great personality. After the reporter shook hands with him to express his respect, we talked about their journey to Shanghai to participate in the war. Now, I will give a faithful report of his conversation. He said, 'Resisting Japan is the only way for the Chinese nation to seek liberation and survival. The Japanese imperialists are oppressing and infringing upon us more and more every day. They will not give us a moment's or a place's peace until they have completely destroyed our entire nation. Therefore, we only have to hold on to the determination to sacrifice, the determination to sacrifice to the end, and fight the enemy, so that the enemy realizes that we cannot be subdued by force.</p>
<p>After the launch of the full-scale war of resistance, the anti-Japanese sentiment in our entire province reached a boiling point. Armed comrades scrambled to request to go out to kill the enemy. The military authorities were almost unable to cope, and it was later decided to use a lottery method to select × division to come to participate in the war. When we stepped onto the front line, the enemy was beginning its sixth general offensive. The enemy first used its abundant munitions to destroy our defenses. The bombs dropped numbered in the hundreds every day, and the shells fired by enemy artillery numbered in the thousands every day. But we are not afraid at all, and we are willing to give our lives. In particular, the lower-level officers took the lead, charging into battle, regarding death as home. Even under the fierce artillery fire of the enemy, not only did they not retreat, but they charged forward one after another. Therefore, the losses we have suffered this time are very heavy. But such heroic sacrifices are proving our vigorous morale and determination to resist the war, so that the enemy cannot easily gain an inch of progress. But the enemy has not yet been wiped out, and we must hold on to the determination to sacrifice to the end, step onto the road of resistance and liberation washed by the blood of the martyrs, and charge forward to strive for final victory.' General Liao repeated this with a firm and affirmative tone, which gave the reporter a very deep impression. When I was writing this, his resolute and courageous attitude was still deeply imprinted in my mind.</p>

<h3>Korean Restoration Movement</h3>
<p>Concentrate Anti-Japanese Forces and Organize United Groups to Restore the Territory of the Three Hans and Fight for Freedom in East Asia</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports: At this time when the enemy is pressing closer, invading our territory, killing our compatriots, and their ambitions are burning ever more brightly, the Korean revolutionary forces are rising day by day. It is learned that the various revolutionary and national salvation organizations of that country, in order to concentrate their strength and resist the oppression of the enemy, have specially organized the 'Joint Propaganda Committee of Korean Restoration Movement Organizations' and issued a declaration to promote independence. The details of this declaration are recorded below: "The issue of Korean independence, at the meeting of the Sino-Japanese War, with the trend of epoch-making, is increasingly prominent in the diplomatic arena. All eyes are on us. People say that the Korean revolutionary force is both China's greatest ally and Japan's greatest enemy. This is what those with a modern perspective have in common. How can the Korean nation, which is at the forefront of the conflict, not be aware of this? In order to advocate the independence of our motherland and uphold the interests of our friendly nations, we have launched attacks on Japan for decades with our experiences and struggles, without interruption. We have never relaxed our connection with friendly nations, and we have exhausted our pens and tongues to encourage cooperation and plan for unity. Fortunately, we have received the support of our friendly parties at home and abroad, and the support of comrades from all walks of life in China. In the past few months, we have actively planned and cooperated, and gathered the talents and plans of comrades from nine groups, including the Korean Overseas Associations of the Far East and North and South America, the National Association, the Korean Patriotic Corps, the Korean Women's Relief Association, the Korean Revolutionary Party, the Korean Nationalist Party, and the Korean Independence Party. We have divided the work and cooperated, vowing to reduce the enemy. We have already issued a declaration, and in order to conduct joint propaganda, we have specially organized a joint agency, named the Joint Propaganda Committee of Korean Restoration Movement Organizations. Various publications will be issued soon (omitted). We hope to provide our friendly nations and revolutionary comrades of small and weak nations, arouse international public opinion, punish the violent Japan, vow to avenge the shame of both countries, and restore our lost land. This is the immediate task that our association bears. We hope that our comrades on the same battle line and friendly government officials, civilians, farmers, businessmen, students, and soldiers who protect the country and resist the Japanese will work together, respond in unison, eliminate the greedy wild boars and long snakes, restore the territory of our motherland, fight for freedom in East Asia, and create justice for mankind. This is our declaration. November, Great Korean Republic, year 19, year 4270."</p>

Our army's position on that line is currently very stable.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Indiscriminately Bombing Western Shanghai and Pudong</h3>
<p>Enemy Single-Winged Giant Seaplane Reconnoitering Nanshi</p>
<p>At around 8:00 AM this morning, two enemy planes circled and reconnoitered in the Yangjing Town, Lanidu, and Yangjiadu areas of Pudong, dropping more than a dozen bombs. They also flew low over Lanidu and Yangjing Town from time to time, strafing with machine guns. The losses are not yet known in detail. In addition, in the Western Shanghai area, more than a dozen enemy heavy bombers flew to the Hongqiao Town and Beixinjing areas at around 6:00 AM this morning and indiscriminately bombed them, dropping no less than a hundred bombs before escaping at about 10:00 AM.

At the same time, a single-winged giant seaplane was also discovered in the Nanshi area this morning. The fuselage was copper-yellow and flying extremely low. From a high vantage point, the pilots and gunners in the plane could be clearly seen. It is said that this is the first time the enemy has used this type of giant plane to reconnoiter Nanshi.</p>

<h3>Italy to Recall Ambassador to Belgium</h3>
<p>(National Maritime News Agency) London, 5th: According to the Standard Evening News, after Italy recalled its ambassador to France, Yang Lüdi, it will soon recall its ambassador to Belgium for the same reason. This reason is that Belgium has not yet appointed its ambassador to Rome as the ambassador to the "Italian Empire."</p>
<h3>Former Soviet Minister to Czechoslovakia Arrested</h3>
<p>[Moscow] The former Soviet Minister to Czechoslovakia, Yanoshiv, and his wife have been arrested by the authorities. It is said that Yanoshiv was working as a spy for a foreign country. Yanoshiv married a Czech woman three years ago and was appointed Chairman of the Cultural Propaganda Department of the Foreign Affairs People's Committee one year ago. A few days ago, Yanoshiv returned home and heard that his wife had been arrested by secret police. Yanoshiv then went to the Foreign Affairs Committee to request her release and never returned. Yanoshiv's wife is known for her beauty and sociability, and she has a wide range of social contacts in diplomatic circles. Friends in Prague, upon hearing the news, requested the Czech Embassy here to help, but this is no longer possible because Yanoshiv's wife became a Soviet citizen after marriage.

<h3>Brussels Conference to Discuss Draft of Reply to Japan This Morning</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Brussels, 6th: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference held a meeting on the morning of the 5th to discuss the reply to Japan. A compromise on the draft of the reply has not yet been reached. Spak, Chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, spent the afternoon of the 5th preparing a new draft. Important representatives from various countries exchanged views on the draft that evening. If the representatives can reach a compromise, the conference will discuss it on the morning of the 6th. Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of our country attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, remained silent at the morning meeting on the 5th because he had clearly stated our country's position at the meeting on the 3rd. Gu felt that it was unnecessary to hinder the progress of the conference until Japan clearly clarified its attitude and that the general attitude expressed by the representatives of various countries at the morning meeting on the 5th was fair. However, the press here believes that the future of the conference does not seem optimistic. Some newspapers commented on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in a satirical tone, calling it the "Brussels Non-Intervention Committee."</p>
<h3>Rumor That Italy Has Expressed Neutrality to Our Government Regarding the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Germany, Italy, and Japan Sign Anti-Comintern Pact and Italian-Japanese Trade Agreement Today</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rome, 6th, Reuters: Regarding the signing of the anti-communist pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Italian government is said to have expressed to the Chinese government that Italy will not aid Japan in the current Sino-Japanese conflict and will maintain complete neutrality. Although Italian newspapers have expressed sympathy for Japan, recognizing Japan's actions in China as anti-communist in nature, the government said that Italy is willing to maintain friendship with both sides. The German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact will be signed at 11:00 AM this morning at the Venice Palace, the residence of Prime Minister Mussolini. German Ambassador to the UK Ribbentrop has arrived in Rome and will sign on behalf of the German government. The Italian side will be signed by Mussolini himself, and the Japanese representative is the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Horita. Upon the arrival of the German representative, news was released here calling him a special envoy of the German leader. It is also said that negotiations on the Italian-Japanese trade agreement have been going on for several months and will now be signed at the same time. The clauses include Japan buying cotton from Abyssinia in exchange for Japanese manufactured goods. Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th, Reuters: A special plenary meeting of the Privy Council will be held at 10:00 AM this morning in the Imperial Palace to formally review the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact. Afterward, the cabinet will convene a special meeting to pass the necessary procedures, and then submit it to the Emperor for approval before telegraphing the Japanese Ambassador in Rome to sign the order. The original text of the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact can be announced around 10:00 PM tonight.</p>
<h3>Our Delegation Denies German Mediation</h3>
<p>National Maritime News Agency, Brussels, 6th: The news released by the American News Agency that parties from both China and Japan have requested the German leader Hitler to mediate has caused great surprise among those attending the conference here. The truth of this news cannot be confirmed. The spokesman for the Chinese delegation declared late last night that the above news is completely unfounded, a blatant fabrication, and a distortion of the truth. Central News Agency, Brussels, 5th, Havas: The diplomatic circles here were quite shocked to hear about the German government mediating the dispute between China and Japan. Well-informed sources recalled that when Germany previously refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it stated, "Whenever several indispensable preconditions are met, Germany will be prepared to cooperate in order to peacefully resolve the dispute between China and Japan." Therefore, everyone is asking whether Germany is waiting for a favorable opportunity to conduct arbitration work alone, so that collective action will be dwarfed. However, since the beginning of the dispute between China and Japan, although Germany has not expressed any ill will towards China, the German diplomatic authorities also hope to act alone and achieve success, so that collective action will be dwarfed. However, since Germany and Japan have already established an anti-communist agreement, Germany is no longer qualified to be an arbitrator in the dispute between China and Japan. In addition, Germany is afraid that it does not want to directly initiate anything, causing it to confront the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the proposal for mediation may not become a reality. On the Chinese delegation's side, there is no news of mediation. The diplomatic circles in this city also believe that China trusts collective action to confront Japan and will not accept the proposal for mediation, which would run counter to the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<h3>Jiang and Cheng Arrive in Brussels</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Brussels, 6th: General Jiang Baili and our Ambassador to Germany, Cheng Tianfang, arrived in the capital together on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Enemy Bombing of Various Counties in Shandong Province</h3>

In Qiu Jia'an, six or seven miles south of Sangzidian, it strafed the civilians. At 9:50 AM, five enemy planes were spotted in Yucheng again. Two of them flew north, and three dropped three bombs in the city, destroying three civilian houses and injuring two civilians. They then flew to Jiyang and dropped four bombs, injuring three civilians and destroying more than twenty civilian houses. At 1:30 PM, an enemy plane flew over Linyi, Jiyang, Qingcheng, Zouping, Zhoucun, and other places to reconnoiter and dropped six bombs in Jiyang, destroying three civilian boats and injuring two people.

<h3>American Doctor Qing Shu Comes to China to Serve</h3>

<h3>Brief Commentary</h3>
<p>— Face</p>
<p>According to general observation, the current situation is divided into two major camps: one is pacifist, and the other is anti-pacifist. The two camps are quite solid, especially the new "Anti-Comintern" pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, which is scheduled to be signed today, further proving that this statement is not false.</p>
<p>Whether the pacifist front is solid or not is not discussed here. Only the anti-pacifist front is discussed. Under certain circumstances, it is possible or necessary for Japan, Germany, and Italy to unite. However, this kind of combination is outwardly consistent but inwardly conflicted and by no means consistent.</p>
<p>The international landscape of alliances is constantly changing at all times. Now Japan wants to implement its continental policy, so it does not hesitate to be obsequious and unite with Germany and Italy. On the one hand, it restrains the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Russia. On the other hand, it can achieve its long-cherished goals. Germany and Italy are "making wedding clothes for others," and the result is not only nothing gained but also harms the friendly feelings of the third party, which is not worth it.</p>
<p>Moreover, international credibility is unreliable. During the European War, Germany should have recognized Japan's face. When the assassination of the Austrian heir occurred, Italy deployed troops in the northern border and recognized Italy's true intentions. From the previous history, infer future changes. Now that Germany and Italy are being used by Japan, and when Germany and Italy want to use Japan in the future, what attitude will Japan take?</p>
<p>With the Germans' sharp eyes, how can they not know the Japanese conspiracy, tricks, and fickleness? Therefore, Germany did not want to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference this time to avoid our country's misunderstanding. Did it already see through the enemy's intentions?</p>
<h3>Enemy Propaganda Threatens Peace-Loving Countries by Announcing War Against Us</h3>
<p>Coercing the Brussels Conference to Go Through the Motions in Order to Achieve Its Goal of Direct Negotiations</p>
<p>[Nanjing] In recent days, the enemy has spread the news of declaring war on us and organizing a wartime headquarters, creating a great momentum and causing a stir. According to an observer, this kind of action by the enemy, regardless of whether it will become a reality in the future, is at least a smokescreen at the moment. The enemy is well aware of the international disputes caused by a formal declaration of war and the various disadvantages to itself. However, it must be after the United Kingdom and the United States express thorough cooperation on the Far East issue and the opening of this capital conference that the news of a formal declaration of war is spread. The purpose is nothing more than to show: ㊀ The dispute is becoming more complicated, and the scope of the war will expand, in order to threaten peace-loving countries. ㊁ Coerce this capital conference to abandon the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty, or even if the meeting is held, it will go through the motions, so that China and Japan can negotiate directly outside the meeting. In addition to the consistent propaganda expressing that the Sino-Japanese dispute will never be interfered with by a third party, in the meeting, it will ask its friendly countries to strongly advocate direct negotiations. The Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun once published an article from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticizing the Brussels Conference, predicting that "a small committee will be organized to go through the motions and quietly observe the changes in the situation, and then come out when there is an appropriate opportunity." Therefore, it is doing everything possible to prevent the arrival of "appropriate opportunities." This is why the atmosphere of declaring war on us and organizing a headquarters has become increasingly strong recently. As for our country, which has been invaded by the enemy, and whose diplomatic relations have not been severed, has long suffered the pain of destruction. Whether to declare war or not makes no difference. In addition to defending the territory of the country and resisting aggression and tyranny for the sake of human justice, we sincerely hope that peace-loving countries will not be misled by the enemy's propaganda, and we hope that the Brussels Conference will follow the spirit of the Washington Conference and not let the Nine-Power Treaty become a useless historical precedent.

<h3>On the Way to the Front Line</h3>
<p>— Central News Agency War Correspondent Communication, Shi Heng</p>
<p>—From Nanjing to Jinan—</p>
<p>Since the enemy planes have肆 recklessly bombed, the feelings among compatriots have become more and more intimate. We often miss the people living in other places with great concern, just as if they were our relatives and friends. The threat of enemy planes has turned into a kind of affinity in the mutual feelings of compatriots.</p>
<p>The reporter's brief record of the situation in a few places on the way to the front line will probably also be welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to say to the countless people in various places who care about Nanjing, our mother's capital is safe and sound, and it will always be so. Some people compare it to the second Madrid, which is inappropriate. However, the people who can still happily live in the capital's embrace now, please cherish yourselves and do not fail the compatriots who are fighting bloody battles on the front lines.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of October 21, before leaving from Pukou, there was an enemy plane bombing, which was regarded as a farewell to the reporter.</p>
<p>The passengers in the car were always on guard against air raids, and they could not sleep all night in the anxiety of being nervous. But thank God, except that the car was running slower than usual, it did not experience any unexpected events. The next morning, when it was getting light, it arrived in Xuzhou safely.</p>
<p>It was originally planned to stay in Xuzhou for a day or two, where there is Chen Lingya, the correspondent of this newspaper stationed in Xuzhou. Everything was taken care of by him, and there was no trouble of feeling unfamiliar.</p>
<p>When you walk out of Xuzhou Station, you can see the remains of the enemy plane's violent bombing. On the west side of Jinpu Station, several shops on the most prosperous main road in Xuzhou have remnants of being bombed.</p>
<p>On the east side of the station is Zifang Mountain, which was probably a scenic spot in peaceful times. However, because of the special visit of enemy planes on August 30, it has now become a field of rubble. Visiting this site seems to be the first thing that should be done in Xuzhou. So I made an appointment with Chen Jun to go together. It just so happened that Chen Jun had agreed to the American news reporter the day before to take a few photos for the purpose of exposing the cruelty of the enemy army to the international community.</p>
<p>Zifang Mountain is named after the Zifang Temple on the mountain. It is said that during the Chu-Han Contention, Zhang Liang played the flute to break the Chu soldiers. There are now more than 2,000 households on the mountain, probably accounting for one-tenth of the total population of Xuzhou. As soon as we approached the foot of the mountain, we could望 see the broken walls and ruins above, which could not help but make people feel desolate. Almost nine out of ten houses on the mountain are empty, and there is no sign of people.</p>
<p>It is said that August 30 was the first bombing of Xuzhou, and it was completely unexpected. At about dusk, twelve planes flew in formation from the northwest, but there was no air raid alarm. At that time, troops were stationed in the Zifang Temple, and soldiers and civilians were all taking shelter in a pavilion in front of the Zifang Temple. Because there was no alarm, everyone believed that it must be our country's planes. We can easily imagine how happy the military and civilians in the inland were when they saw their own planes, but when they flew over their heads, the planes suddenly changed their faces, bombs and machine gun strafing followed down, and sixty or seventy houses were destroyed in this bombing, and the number of casualties was always over 150.</p>
<p>The tragic state at that time is difficult to describe for those who have not been there. A family of more than ten people who were engineers on the Jinpu Railway were all crushed under the collapsed brick walls and roofs. Another five- or six-year-old girl who was hiding in the house poked her head out of the house after hearing the first wave of explosions, but at this time she was hit by fragments of a newly dropped bomb, and her intestines were blown out. The soldiers and civilians who were taking shelter in the pavilion in front of the Zifang Temple escaped the bombs, but did not escape the machine gun strafing.</p>
<p>The Zifang Temple was rebuilt in the early Qing Dynasty and still preserves the inscriptions written by Emperor Qianlong when he went to the south. Although this ancient temple was the target of the bombing, it only suffered minor damage. The majestic statue of Zifang in the main hall is still intact, perhaps because of his divine protection. The statues of the land god and Maitreya Buddha in the side hall are not considered spiritual. In particular, the Maitreya Buddha with a big belly that says "hehe haha," his belly has been split into two sections.</p>
<p>The most tragic families that were bombed were next to the Zifang Temple. We chose a relatively complete one and walked in, but we could not see anything. Only an empty house shell remained. What is most touching is that there are still a few pigeons that people used to raise in this empty house. Pigeons, the symbol of peace, are you also scared out of your wits? Why do you fly away in such a panic when you hear people's footsteps? In an empty house, we also found a two-foot-long, still intact portrait of an old woman. Dear old woman, are you sitting there alone because you are reluctant to leave your old home, or者 are you really so stubborn that you are waiting for the enemy planes to come again, ready to die with the enemy?</p>
<p>The air defense equipment in Xuzhou is certainly not as good as that in the capital, so enemy planes can fly very low without fear. Therefore, many legends about enemy planes flying low have spread among the villagers in the vicinity. Of course, these are not very reliable, and some are even impossible. But from these legends, we can see how bold the enemy planes are in general villages and towns, compared to their cowardly sneaking into the high altitude of Nanjing, hiding in the clouds, and fleeing in a panic when they hear the sound of anti-aircraft guns. The way they look is really heaven and earth.</p>
<p>In various rural areas, there are earthen buildings built to defend against bandits, which at most are as high as ordinary three-story buildings in the city. Now, they are used as shelters, with branches or leaves placed on top. Who knows that this shelter is really redundant. When the enemy planes fly past, they often sweep away those shelters completely, and even the removed branches are hung on the fuselage. A villager lying on his back in the field can望 see the enemy plane's pilot, and he is sure that he saw the pilot's beard on his face. Under the cruel and shameless bombing of the enemy planes, the people cannot just be imprisoned in terror. It is true and half-fabricated to create some legends that are terrifying and a bit funny, which are intended to be used as a basis for jokes when they are relatively free, as a mutual comfort, right? Xuzhou is the intersection of the Jinpu and Longhai railways and is an important place for transportation and military affairs. It is natural for enemy planes to visit often. The alarm goes off at least two or three times a day. Enemy planes often pass by and do not drop bombs here. In fact, apart from the station, which is the target of its bombing, there is nothing else to bomb.</p>
<p>On this day when the reporter was in Xuzhou, he also encountered a small bombing. When the alarm was issued, Chen Jun and I were walking near the station, so we had to temporarily take shelter in an air raid shelter built by the road workers next to the station. Two loud noises followed the sound of the planes, which shook our ears and made us feel as if the bombs had fallen nearby. After the investigation, we found out that there was still a considerable distance. One bomb fell in front of the Army Hospital, and one bomb fell in the courtyard of the Zhongxing Coal Mining Company. They were all very small bombs, leaving two small caves and collapsing a few houses. One piece of bomb fragment penetrated five inches deep into the tree trunk. Although it was said to be a very small bomb, the sound and destructive power were quite impressive. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>New Hong Kong Governor's Statement on the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Hoping for an Early End to the China Crisis</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The newly appointed Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffry Northcote, commissioned by the British government, arrived in Hong Kong on the 28th at 9:00 AM aboard the British ship "Ranchi" with his wife. The Hong Kong government prepared an official ceremony to welcome them ashore. At 10:00 AM, the new Governor disembarked at Queen's Pier amidst cheers and shook hands with officials and gentry. A military parade was held, and then he proceeded by car to the Government House. At 11:15 AM, he was formally sworn in as Governor at the Legislative Council. At noon, he attended a public welcome reception at the Entertainment Theatre. At the reception, the new Governor made a statement regarding the war between the two major Far Eastern nations. While he did not criticize right or wrong, he hoped that the League of Nations could find a way to resolve the dispute and that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference would achieve positive results. At the end of his speech, he advocated for working together with neighboring countries. An excerpt of the new Governor's speech follows: "Having just listened to the public's welcome address, I will begin with the concluding remarks, which stated that people from all sectors in Hong Kong will sincerely cooperate with me in the future. I believe this is the fundamental issue for us. As I take up the position of Governor of Hong Kong under the Emperor's command, I am confident that I will be able to gain the full cooperation of the people of Hong Kong to solve various difficult problems. I am deeply moved by your warm reception, as cooperation between the government and the people is the key to success. Therefore, my belief in this is even stronger. Hong Kong's hard work and progress over the past few years are admired by the British at home and abroad. Hong Kong has opened its doors wide to welcome refugees, and I express my sympathy and would like to take this opportunity to extend my condolences to the refugees staying in Hong Kong. In these turbulent times, with two major countries engaged in war, I do not wish to comment on the rights and wrongs of this incident. However, the Far East Advisory Committee of the League of Nations is making its utmost effort to find a solution to this massacre and destruction of humanity, which you are all well aware of. I, along with you, earnestly hope that the Brussels Conference will proceed smoothly so that the crisis in China's development today can be extinguished. Of the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty, none is making more effort towards this goal than the British Empire. Hong Kong can certainly contribute to this, and let us do our best to follow through. I am fortunate to be able to continue the legacy of my predecessor, Sir Andrew Caldecott. Sir Caldecott's character and policies have gained the trust and cooperation of the people of Hong Kong, as far as I know. From what I see today, there is no more important principle in governance than continuing the policies of the past. It would be undesirable for a new governor to overturn the policies that the previous governor had worked on for years. Therefore, I will administer Hong Kong's affairs along the lines I have mentioned above, and I believe we will all agree.</p>
<p>Regarding the specific policies and plans adopted by Hong Kong, it is not appropriate to announce them at this grand gathering. However, I will closely examine the points just mentioned in the welcome address and the final words of advice that Sir Caldecott gave in the Legislative Council. I would especially like to highlight the most important point that Sir Caldecott made, which is friendship with our neighbors. I would like to take this opportunity to express my determination to continue in Sir Caldecott's footsteps with my utmost effort. I have just said that I am deeply grateful for the willingness of all sectors to cooperate fully. I now express my sincere gratitude to you all and wish to work with you to live up to the expectations of His Majesty the King. Hong Kong is an important British overseas territory and is of great importance to world commerce. Therefore, I am determined to do my best to achieve genuine prosperity and fulfill my responsibilities. I am confident that with God's blessing, in a few years, we will place our hopes on flourishing prosperity."</p>

<p>Changshu Correspondence: After the enemy troops occupied Zhabei and Zhenru, the enemy planes bombed the rear areas and non-combatant counties even more severely than before. On the afternoon of November 28th, this area had already been ravaged five times. The people of the city, mindful of the enemy planes' atrocities in the Songjiang area in recent days, were on high alert and flocked to the countryside for temporary shelter. The city was desolate, with few pedestrians on the streets, creating a very bleak scene. On the 29th, enemy planes continued to fly over the city, and the air defense authorities sounded air raid alerts more than twenty times throughout the day. However, the enemy planes seemed to be scouting and did not drop any bombs. Only at around 10:00 AM, when passing over the Yanqing Bridge outside Xiaodongmen, several farmers happened to be working in the fields. The enemy planes immediately strafed them with machine guns, but the farmers managed to take cover and were unharmed. On the 31st, it was cloudy and rainy all day, and no enemy planes were seen, providing a day of peace. The next morning, the weather cleared, and from 11:15 AM to 2:30 PM, air raid alerts were sounded seven times. Most of the enemy planes flew directly over from north to south. In Xinzhuang Village in the southern countryside, there were many stacks of rice, large and small, of varying heights. The enemy planes, suspecting they were some kind of equipment, strafed them with machine guns for a long time before continuing south. The most hateful thing was that at Xiaolang Temple, located at the junction of Changshu, Suzhou, and Wuxi, the monk of the temple had engaged in immoral behavior, and the local people expelled him and appointed another abbot. The monk, harboring resentment, falsely reported to the enemy that the temple contained certain military equipment. The enemy believed him and sent planes to bomb the temple, resulting in multiple hits. This kind of ridiculous act is truly laughable. It was previously rumored that Dang Kou was bombed, but this was a misreport of this incident.</p>
<h3>Joint Library Broadly Seeks Readers and Books and Newspapers</h3>
<p>The joint library established by the book industry and Ying Society officially opened on the first of this month, openly lending books and providing access to various newspapers, magazines, and small series. Since its opening, the number of readers has been quite enthusiastic. Now, in order to solve the spiritual food of the general public, the library has decided to broadly solicit ordinary readers and basic readers, and hopes that newspapers, magazines, bookstores, and individuals will provide practical assistance. The library address is No. 8, Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>The Current Pressing Tasks of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Liu Yucai</p>
<p>The aggression against China by the world's robber, Japanese imperialism, has been a decades-long ambition and a matter of fact, which cannot be denied. Since the September 18th Incident, they have successively occupied our four northeastern provinces. Recently, the Lugouqiao Incident led to the capture of Peiping and Tianjin, revealing their deliberate intention to occupy the entire North China and then coerce Central and South China. The outbreak of the Shanghai Battle on August 13th even more strikingly exposed the enemy's insatiable greed and attempt to take an inch after getting a foot. This is merely a sharpening of the enemy's delusion to realize their continental policy. Conversely, it is enough to accelerate the collapse and gradual elimination of their power in China! In other words, this is precisely the period for China and the enemy to settle blood debts, thereby breaking free from decades of trampling and oppression and finally gaining the opportunity for final victory!</p>
<p>Our nation's soldiers and civilians, facing the enemy's invasion and fierce fighting, must first recognize that the enemy's military force is not to be feared. Under the leadership of the government, we must work together with one heart and one mind, each doing our best, to fully unleash our people's self-defense power to fight to the death against the enemy! Then victory will surely belong to us. It is not enough for everyone to go to the front lines to be considered resisting the war. We must each do our part to participate in various war resistance and national salvation efforts. The wartime services of people's organizations that everyone can see now can be said to be only a very small part. The war of resistance in Shanghai has been going on for more than two months. Shanghai has more than three million citizens. Apart from foreign nationals, the elderly, women, and children, there are at least more than two million people. If such a number is organized, trained, and joined in wartime work, I dare say that the strength of the people in the rear in resisting the war will exceed the current results by tens or hundreds of times. It is a pity that this immense force has not yet been concretely mobilized and planned. Secondly, regarding the war resistance services of the people in the rear areas, we still feel that they are very thin and insufficient. Although high-ranking and capable personnel in various fields are initiating them there, they are still not effectively and fully manifested. From this point of view, the current remedial measures should actively promote the following tasks, which are urgent and cannot be delayed:</p>
<p>First: Taking Shanghai as a starting point, the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association should issue a general order to the propaganda teams of various legal wartime national salvation organizations to be separately organized into mobile propaganda teams to actively exert their propaganda power in various places.</p>
<p>Second: The personnel currently responsible for promoting wartime work in various places must intensify their work, quickly organize and train a large number of people in the rear, and guide their various service guidelines to increase the efficiency of war resistance.</p>
<p>Third: Under the leadership of the government, organize armed groups of people in various provinces, cities, counties, and villages, actively implement military training, and if necessary, strengthen the military power of the front lines. At the very least, they can eliminate traitors in the rear, which indirectly weakens the enemy's power of aggression.</p>
<p>Fourth: Under the auspices of local administrative agencies, launch a permanent economic boycott against Japan to strangle the enemy's foreign trade, which indirectly causes economic panic in the enemy's country and deals a major blow to the warmongers.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned items are all urgent war resistance tasks that need to be worked on, and none of them are positive steps to save the nation and ensure its survival. The national crisis has reached this point, and it is time for our compatriots to destroy their homes to relieve the national crisis and sacrifice themselves to save the country. It is not permissible to stand idly by and seek temporary comfort. Only by having the national militia practically participate in the war of resistance can we win national survival and freedom, and only a national revolutionary war of resistance can achieve final victory!</p>
