<h3>綏邊情勢之檢討都</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>自綏邊國軍抗戰獲勝。紅格爾圖一役予匪巨創。百靈廟次第收復。一時緊張空氣。乃得漸見緩和。雖某方暗中之策動。仍在積極籌維。軍容給養之整飭。依然未見鬆懈。然共大舉侵擾之計劃。迄今猶在按而不發之中。卽有局部衝突之事。亦祇以游擊之方式。作多方之試探。以牽掣吾人耳目而已。兩月以來。腹地人士。視線所注。始而集中於西安事變。繼則轉移於三中全會。對此國防第一線之縈慮。此較上乃有暫形冷落之勢。今內部措置。大體就緒。整個團結。已無問題。一致對外之情緒。自將較前為更烈。而綏邊局勢最近之變化。亦誠有重予檢討之必要。</p>
<p>某方蠶食察綏。蓄懷已久。雖遭挫沮。豈所甘心。其必出於更大之狡展。要亦吾人意計所應有。然以大勢所趨。最近殆有不能不略予躊躇者。故倐稱進窺張垣獨石口。條傳緩東將有新發動。實則商都康保等處。匪偽紛紛東退。存儲張北軍火。亦復大批運回。最近據聞察北偽軍。大都退入熱境。張北特務機關。亦已撤往多倫。就表面觀。綏邊寇禍。似可暫紓。非有特殊變化。戰機庶免重燃。某方之所以暫時放棄積極政策者。國軍防禦鞏固。土有必死之志。一也。通國憤愾填膺。一致聯絡援助。二也。反正空氣突濃。無法加以控制。三也。漢奸勢力銷沈。失其利用目的。四也。蘆某方始終欲憑睡手之故智。蔪不勞而坐𫊧。憚用自己實力。作正面之接觸。深恐事態逼僵。轉成不了之局。其患得患失之心理。亦不難予人以共見。藉令當時國軍捍禦不力。則匪偽自將長馴而直入亦無由激發反正之壯志。藉令全國援應散漫。則某方必且覤破我弱點。更何有日援之顯慮。故今兹凶燄之熸消。一、由於前線誓死守士之有人。二、由於後方一致團結之形成。</p>
<p>明乎此。則吾人欲保持國士之完整。專尚不知所以自處。以某方之詭譎多端。烟幕頻施。聲東聲西、是其價技。以退為進。正復難料。吾人決不能錯認目前之形勢。遽抱苟安之樂觀。唯有以旦夕不弛之殺力。為隨時應付之準備。下犧牲一切之決心。謀全國意志之集中。其有別具肺腸。倡為蠱説。榮惑軍心。破壞團結者舉國人士必共棄之。</p>

<p>第一可注目者、為中央部尤其參謀本部之強化、蓋以中島少將任總務部、以石原莞爾少將任第一部長、以武藤·川邊·西原·三大佐任課長、以樋口大佐任參謀本部附、鞏固中堅陣容、可謂參謀本部近來之壯觀、卽謂軍令方而之準戰時體形由此確立亦可、陸軍省方面旣以後宮任軍務局長、足以補磯谷少將之所短、復輔之以田中軍事，柴山軍務課長、並以河南少將任人事局長、飯田少將任兵務局長、川村中佐任軍務課之高級課長、是本省之新陣容總括的觀之、可謂此從前強化</p>
<p>第二、有許多之點表示新機軸者、卽以從來未會與技術方面發生關係之岡部少將、任技術本部總務部長、以青木大佐任本省機械課長是也、從過去之經歷與經騐觀之、非常適任、又柴山大佐於軍政殆無經騐、而共專門則在於中國關係、而以之任政策方面之事、蓋欲以之輔佐於中國關係無經騐之後宮局長也、從中國問題之重要性及柴山大佐之人物觀之、蓋極適當之人事異動也、</p>
<p>第三、為關東軍之板垣參謀長去職、及阪西一良·武藤章·兩大佐之離去課長之職、亦可謂大異動、而繼板垣之後者為東條中將、其他之補任亦煞費苦心、是關東軍之陣容亦極堅固、東條中將在中央部有許多適常之要職、故應㧞擢繼任板垣之耍職、至板垣中將之第五師團長雖有議論、然共進出中央、可謂待機、總之、杉山陸相之初次人事異動、可謂反第云、（二十五日同盟電）</p>

<p>民政黨田島勝太郎（民政黨）質問</p>
<p>日本製鐵公司改為官辦則如何、又製鐵國策之根本方針如何、</p>
<p>伍堂商相答</p>
<p>關於製鐵國策對實際有必要者、實行旣定計劃、而為便利輸入鋼材起見、免收關稅兩年、蓋在此兩年間增產鐵鋼計劃可以完成也、世傳日鐵中心主義等説、然據余意見、不應有日鐵之獨估主義、製鐵業之官辨化、今日尚難實現、</p>
<p>篠原義政（政友會）問</p>
<p>今日地方自治體與部落氏之關係、漸次稀薄、且自治體有法人化之傾向、關於如此地方制度之現狀、見解如何、</p>
<p>河原田內相答</p>
<p>地方制度曾於明治初年、山縣公爵山外國採用、應日本之狀態而實施者、其結果大體有可觀之點、部落財產制度如有應改善之點、則當改善之、</p>
<p>篠原義政問結城藏相之財政政策極度偏重都市、首相之所信如何、</p>
<p>林首相答</p>
<p>因認減少地方交付金、在財政政策上有利、故加以修正、未會想及農村竟有發生如今日之問題、</p>
<p>篠原於是停止質問、九時十分散會、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］廿五日之衆院預算總會、上午十時開會、前次保留質疑之勝正憲（民政）起而論難地方財政調整交付金七千萬元計算之基礎、並指摘此次將二億二千萬元改為七千萬元地方負担輕減額、仍比前案減少一億五千萬元、無如政府所言減少三千萬元程度之事、次論難市部負担與郡部負担之不公平、陳述多數地方之陳情、提議請政府於此時增額、</p>
<p>結城藏相答</p>
<p>此是否眞正為農村之聲、為政者與君等均有充分考慮之必要、政府擬再加研究、能待至下屈議會乎、如有時問、惟有由政府輿議會協議之而已、</p>
<p>勝王憲</p>
<p>不能增額、為財源之關係·乎、抑有其他之理由乎、政黨之案為六千五百萬元、是否財源雖有餘裕、而認此額為已充分乎、</p>
<p>結城藏相答</p>
<p>今日尚無財政上之餘裕、勝正憲</p>
<p>臨時的以一年為限、依公債財源何如、</p>
<p>結城藏相答</p>
<p>經濟界之現狀、雖發行三厘五毫公債能否消化、尚為疑問、預定之公債能否完全消化亦不能無疑、卽十二年度亦務必不勉強發行云、</p>
<p>豫算總會於午後二時半續開會、首由委員長質問政府、</p>
<p>在總會開會期內、有無提出修正豫算案之希望、</p>
<p>結城藏相答</p>
<p>修正豫算案已交閣議付議、擬於二十六日提出、繼由民政黨之末松偕一氏質問政府、同無政黨及廢省與合併問題、國策綜合機關之追加豫算等件、</p>
<p>林首相答</p>
<p>省之廢合尚未具體考慮、至國策綜合機關雖認為必要、但前內閣之方案尚順研究、故追加豫算之計入尚屬未定、</p>
<p>結城藏相稱關於豫算之修正、欲與議會充分商討軍部豫算、仍照舊表現於豫算數目上者也、</p>
<p>未松氏問</p>
<p>農村之經濟團體與社會公共團體之亂立、有無整理之意、</p>
<p>河原田內相答</p>
<p>地方各種團體欲整理而統一之、但均須於地方制度調查會充分加以研究、</p>
<p>末松氏問</p>
<p>地方付欵之分配、內相所見若何、</p>
<p>內相答</p>
<p>約五六千萬圓充作減輕戶數分配、尚有一二千萬圓充減輕所謂惡稅之雜稅、</p>
<p>末松氏至此論及航空政策、主張發行愛國航空債券、</p>
<p>杉山陸相答</p>
<p>對於發展航空事業自當努力、</p>
<p>松田竹千氏（民政）問</p>
<p>迄今日本外交認為係被動的外交、若欲將日本使之在國際上有正確之認識、則應尚須成為動態的外交、</p>
<p>林兼外相答</p>
<p>本人對於外交雖係門外漢、但處於應當主張者則敢於直率主張、認為此乃外交之要諦、</p>
<p>松田氏問</p>
<p>現內閣之外交方針若何、林兼外相答</p>
<p>並非專注於經濟外交、認為應向文化的和平外交上進行、故現努力於此、</p>
<p>民政黨之高橋熊次郎謂須使農村復活、並質問政府對於農村政策之見解、</p>
<p>結城藏相答</p>
<p>由國防上觀之、農村復活實有必要、自當致力於物質與精神兩大方面也、</p>
<p>高橋氏問</p>
<p>今日之農村　除米繭等類主要農產品以外、應圖增加收入、故須以獎勵農產之輸出與輸入為適當、政府之見解若何、</p>
<p>結城藏相答</p>
<p>並不懂注重於米興爾、而謀農下兩業之調和、亦屬必要、如毛織物絨毯豆腐等數卽其一例、與進出口有關之農產、自當盡力獎勵也、</p>
<p>高橋氏議及振與東北之對策、詢政府有無設立東北廳之意、</p>
<p>藏相答以東北預算、含有積極振興之意義、但其方策不甚佳、該預算卽不與一般預算分離、而對於振興上並無任何障碍等語、</p>
<p>林首相答</p>
<p>東北廳之設立問題尚在研究中、未便答辯關於振興之經費、政府亦認為不足、今後當充分努力、</p>
<p>午後六時休息、（二十五日同盟電）</p>

<h3>日本第七十次議會的“進一步退兩步”</h3>
<p>一·波瀾重疊後的議會再開</p>
<p>東京通訊、日本第七十次讓會、於一月二十一日重開時、因為政友會代表濱田國松和前陸相寺內壽一、發生口角之故、卽未續開、這種口角衝突、如報紙所載、若在平時、雙方經過一夜休息後、也許立刻會歸於好、都説不定、可是當時情勢、不但不充許這簡的解决、而且引起了廣田內閣的總辭、宇垣組閣的波蘭與失敗、灌之以林內閣的出現、在這個期間讓會先奉令停會兩天、復昌動休會十天、接着又因新阁修正各種法案停會兩回、總計前後中斷二十二天為日本有議會以來中斷最長的一次、其間席田內閣在議曾期內辭職、除一九二三年桂內閣以議憲運動而崩潰外絕無前例宇垣奉命組閣、因軍部反對而流產、也除大正年間清浦奎吾有此一段故事外、別無先例、現在從一月二十三日到二十九日一週之中、經過這樣兩樁大事、日本政局的杌隍、由此可見、</p>
<p>二·十分鐘的首相演説</p>
<p>經過冬眠”後的議會、終於二月十五日重開了、那一天長空如洗、萬里無雲、和一月二十一日的慘怛陰霾的天氣相較、映成有趣的一個明暗的對照、我們雖然照舊跑去旁聽、但見到過去一週來政黨和林閣雙方避迵衝突的形勢、已預感到不會有什麼劇烈的情景、</p>
<p>接着貴族院面開的衆院會讓原定下午一時集會、但因臨時濱田國松要求在議程中加入他對軍部的辯解各派一度討論深怕這樣一來再引起意外的紛爭勸其作罷因此延到兩點鐘纔開、議會躱避軍部的鋒芒、偷安苟全的態度、這時已經暴露出來了、</p>
<p>林銑十郎的總理廳政演説、不過十二分鐘、兼外相的外交演説、只六分鐘就完畢、一共不到二十分鐘、台下自民政黨為始、鼓掌的很多、與上次廣田演説時、底下破口叫嘯的情景、逈乎不同、</p>
<p>三·結城豊太郎的登塲</p>
<p>結城藏相接着起來演説、銡城雖然是新閣中六個毫無議會經驗閣員之一、但是風釆態度較之馬場勝過一籌、而目演説時、聲音很響亮有一個日本記者、因為他的身軀極小而聲音很大、諷刺的説、一結城的聲音不是從那裏借來的吧“頗有意味、不過結城是林閣中比較最有”人望“的一個、是不可否認的事、他的全部演説中的特色、是素樸和直率、他對日本財政前途和他的抱負、沒有何等表示、只是把預算大綱念了一過述設了修正馬塲原案的幾點事實、但他大胆地承認目前巨額預算和增稅、都是國軍費增加無可如何的事、尤其是後來在答辯中、坦自承認他不能對日本財政的展望有何見解、那種態度、至少可以説是很誠摯、台下除了當他説到一安定國民生計一時東方會中義笑地喊着“對農村怎樣啊”之外、大體都是好意支援、最後連社會大衆黨都鼓掌送他退壇、</p>
<p>四·問答的經過</p>
<p>結城演説完了後、接着就是議員的質問、關於個別質問的內容、大體已見報載、此地是要就當日議會—貴衆兩院—的質問、和閣員的答辯、分出幾項重要部門綜合報告一下、其中關於對華外交、因為與我們關係最大、所以首先紀述如下、</p>
<p>㊀關於對華外交這次不僅林自己在他的外交演説中開宗明義就聲述一中日兩國不僅政府卽人民亦應多多接近以舉中日提携互助之實“、並且在議會的質問中、這一點也特別可注意、貴族院第一個質問者渡邊千冬子爵（研究會）、劈頭就問林、一政府對中日外交究有何根本方針一、林答、”已如本人在外交方針演説中所説、就是設法使中日關係明朗化一、後來公正會的阪谷芳郞男爵進一步向林質問、“我國的大陸政策、時常使人誤解為侵略外國的領土、譬如中國國民就認為日本是侵犯了滿洲、並且有侵略華北的意思、記得往日孫中山革命時代、會求助於我國、中國人民很盼望我國的帮助、但是近來中國全土捲起抗日的運動、國家的統一竟籍抗日而完成、這足證明日本”大陸政策“的眞意、未能使中國了解日本誠意未免不足”、然而林的答覆不外一關於對華關係、日“滿華三國親善是我國不動的方針、本人相信這遠東第”必要的事、將來務使三國國民感情融洽、經濟提携、努力使中國十分諒解我國的眞意”、</p>
<p>其次、衆議院中政友會代表植原悅二郎於外交問題質問中、先提出外交一元化的問題、“林首相聲明外交政策的確立、及其一元化、我們對之願表全幅敬意廣田內閣外交的全面崩潰、原因雖多、但主要不外秘密中義和官僚獨善主義、林首相為確立外交政策計、是否有打破祕密主義外交的决心、就外交一元化而言、外交本是外務省專管的事項、林首相是否有一掃廣田內閣當時惡弊的覺悟、其次、就外交國是而言、外交異於內政、是不因內閣更迭而有所變化的、本席對於外交國是的遂行、認為有四日重要的事、第一、對滿政策的確立、第二、日蘇國交的調整第三、中日兩國善僯關係的敦厚、第四遠東的防共工作”、植原繼又特別關於對華政策提出五點加以質詢、“就敦厚中日兩國善隣關係而言第一、我國對於全世界應明臼宣布我國並非軍國主義的國家、並且沒有領土的野心、第二、對於現在中國全國奔騰澎湃的新與國家主義思想和國民運動、應有正確的認識、第三使中日兩國民覺悟到彼此必須眞正成為共存共榮的國民在這種心理狀况之下、展開兩國的外交工作、第四防共工作的澈底化第五、中日兩國的提携、先應以經濟政策為基點、林首相對於以上各點、所見如何一．林的答覆頗簡單．”外交方針、目下務期使之在各方面均無遺憾、對“滿”問題、本人意亦如此、封華對蘇的關係也完全同感“（這時台下大笑並喊呌”這是什麼話呀？”）植原冉登台追問、但顯然沒有進攻的準備、祇説、“外交方針、已有所聞、問題在於如何實行、關於外交一元化的實行方計希望再説清楚些”林使用他一貫的迴避戰衛．對最後一點、並不正面答覆、只稱“關於打破所謂秘密外交云云、已有所準備、國民外交、並未忘却”、</p>
<p>在這些問一答之中、我們可以很清楚地看出、㊀使中國發生對日的惡感、根原在於日本、是他們所共同認識的、㊁這根原不去對華侵略的印象卽不能掃除、不能掃除這印象中日兩國的外交、即不能展開”、也是他們所不諱言的、㊂日本外交一元化的必要、議會方面極為重視、但林並沒有把握加以答覆、㊃林的答覆、儘管是那樣不中肯綮、但議會方面、並沒有追究的决心、衆議院的兩　　　政黨、都懷有解散的畏懼、更極力避免衝突發生的可能性、這在以下兩問題上、也表現得非常顯然、</p>
<p>㊁法西斯化及宇垣組閣失敗問題關於法西斯化問題、這次衆院並未提出、只貴族院的渡邊子爵於問畢對華政策後、曾質間道、“對於法西斯專制政治、政府所信如何”、林答關“於立憲政治的形態、把外國思想原封原樣輸入進來那樣的畢、毫未想到、但望施行恪導我國獨特的欽定憲法所規定的政治”、</p>
<p>衆院民政黨議員小泉又次郎、雖未明白指出法西斯化問題、但曾質問林、所謂恪遵憲法而施政任何人都無異義、林首相為什發特別提出、並加以“獨特的”字樣、是否含有特殊的意味、林答、“我不過希望恪遵以我國萬邦無比國體為淵源的欽定憲法精神、加以運用此外並無他意”、這裹如果再加追問、當然還有疑點可問、不僅如比林的答辯、甚至可以説使問題更濃厚化、但是合下除了哄笑着説、“這又何必請你解釋”外、並未再進一步、無形中默認“獨特的憲法”字樣之使用、可以成立、</p>
<p>與這一問題很有關聯的、就是這次林組閣時堅特黨員不説黨籍不得入閣、事實上等於否認政黨有參加政權的資格、這種熊度、在政黨還存在的現狀下、尤其是政黨不僅會經參加過內閣、而且組織過十幾年內閣之後、當然不能不加以有力的玫擊但是關於這一點、只有小泉痛述一番明治初年政黨“犧牲性命、傾家破產、誠必誠意、貢獻於憲政之發逹後“略略訊問林持什麼理由、要求入閣的人脫離黨籍、此外幾乎無人敢於再問、而林對這一問題的答覆、再簡單沒有、”因為我認為當時的情形、沒有請政黨入閣的必要”、（未完）</p>

<h3>上海實騐小學概况（三）</h3>
<p>本報特訊　胡祖蔭調查</p>
<p>三，行政設施</p>
<p>（一）行政組織：該校行政組織係參照江蘇省教育廳頒佈的實騐小學組織規程酌加變通。全校校務由校長全權處理。校長之下設總務系，教導系，研究系及特種委員會，分别處理所屬各種事項。各系之下又分設若干課，恊助處理系務。又另設第一，第二，第三三部，隸屬於總務，教導，研究三系，處理各部的教導和實騐研究事宜。每部之下又設若干股，恊助處理部務。有關於校中的重大事項，則取决於校務會；校務會停開期間，由行政委員會代行其職權。</p>
<p>（二）學級編制：該校第一部設幼稚園，一年，二年，三年，四年，五年，六年各一學校；第三部設單級，一二年複式，三四年複式各一學校，五年，六年各二學級，合計十四學級。此十四學級是普通的學級編制，而且都是秋季始業。至於實騐學科，則依據智力，學力，另行分組。第二部另設推廣班六學級，計有二年，三年，四年，五年各一學級，六年兩學級，所有學科與普通學校同。推廣班的設立，是表示恊助推行義務教育的意思。二十五年秋季，該校共有學生一○○八人，其中男生七二三人，女生二八五人。</p>
<p>（三）經費收友：該校每年度由省庫支撥經常費二萬三千五百六十元，辦理十四學級。其中有事業費一千五百元。規定規理實騐研究推廣事宜。該校學費奉廳令免收。雜費材料費每年收入約一千二百元，爲添購兒童圖書館及勞作材料體育用品等之用。第二部的推廣班六學級，不支省費，即以所收入的書籍費，雜費，材料費約二千五百元，抵充薪工辦公等費。至於該校在吳家巷興建的新校舍的全部建築費約計四萬七千餘元。除由省庫撥助臨時費五千五百元外：其餘不足的數額都是由該校教職員推行新五年建設計劃（容後介紹）所獲的經濟助力而完成。（未完）</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>倉庫存紗外流紗市頓起反動</p>
<p>究以期現差價太遠</p>
<p>實銷一動引起扒空</p>
<p>近月重出四十元關</p>
<p>本月空方有貼價收回説</p>
<p>連跌三日之紗市、昨則轉趨上漲、蓋以三月期標紗價格、較現紗價相差十元、目前廠方存紗無多、所有現貨、大都集中紗布倉庫中、至於印商派多頭收進巨量現紗、在市竭力設法運銷、據云多方願照三月標紗價由空方貼出五·六元、將貨收回不解、於是人氣轉挺、同時客銷活動、倉庫中紗賣去二千餘包、午後市價繼續前進矣、</p>
<p>標紗回漲二元八</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月轉趨上漲、因三日來跌勢劇烈、引起獲利者扒補、同時紗銷有一千包外、倉庫中賣出八百七十包、於是人心略昂、不若上日之恐虚矣、但大都心理仍屬觀低、逢漲抛賣、因存紗有漸漸增高之望、紗廠全部開車、生産較前大增、不過目前已跌殊巨、或有回高幾元能力也、本月復出四十元關外、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一元三·四角至一元九角、午後開盤市情依然、穩定、因消息良好、多頭在市極力想法、將收進籌碼銷去、客方生意尚佳、各帮買去現紗有三千三百餘包、倉庫中紗、佔二千零二十包、又值明日舉行交割、散户爲避風險計、軋直過夜者尤急市盤緩歩前進、結果各月比上午收盤價再漲八·九角至一元、查賣出大孚六千二百包、恒益一千三百五十包、大豐三千五百包、賡豐二千七百包、永昌九百五十包、裕康九百五十包、明德一千三百五十包、昶記一千二百五十包、泰昌三千二百五十包、長豐二千六百包、買進恒昌一千一百包、元一九百包、吉豐二千七百五十包、合興二千八百包、長餘一千三百五十包、　豐四千一百五十包、望泰興一千五百五十包、潤康三千六百五十包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>標花回漲二三角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉續升、各月一律上升、氣勢穩定、惟印棉平庸、本埠存棉濃厚、各路地頭存貨充足、因此多數心思看疲、不過二日來已跌甚鉅、引起獲利者扒空而堅、結果各月　上日收盤價均漲二角半、午後開盤市况益緊、因紗市上升、棉市帶好、但現棉交易不旺、同業傾向抛空壓力重重、結果近月比上午收盤價再漲一角半、遠月勿動、查賣出裕大九千八百担、申大二千五百担、大昌成一千担、長和一千七百担、恒益二千三百担、大豐一千七百担、義成三千三百担、泰昌二千三百担、福康一千三百担、新昶二千五百担、買進大孚三千担、吉豐三千一百担、合興一千七百担、源大一千三百担、賡豐二千一百担、長餘二千三百担、豐泰三千七百担、仁豐一千三百担、潤康九千七百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>現棉仍杳無起色</p>
<p>現棉消費平凡、廠方辦胃不强、來源亦未見云、</p>
<p>美棉業買進三月期</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦消息良好、利物浦帮買進、各月漲二至五磅音、同業經紀商見交割通知僅有三紙發表、現棉情形堅定、買進三月期、對於國外幣制情形、人心不一、而塲內缺乏大量套賣、頗有注意之價值、私家估計押欵棉花之出售、約達六十二萬包、入後市况更形活動、新棉現貨商有售出、收盤穩固、計現貨漲十磅音、期貨漲二至十二磅音、英棉現貨漲三點、期貨漲三四點、印棉初因歐洲出口商買進而漲、旋以股市不振而疲、卒因大衆買進、空户抵補、及利物浦消息良好、市况再昂、計平果爾漲○·二五羅比、奥姆辣漲○·二五至○·五羅比、白羅溪漲○·二五羅比、原電錄左、（二十四日電）</p>

<p>標金多爲限價交易</p>
<p>金市昨初以海外銀市升降俱微、滙兑微縮、倫敦生金漲一便士、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位升二厘、標凖標金價掛牌升爲一一五六元四角、晨開微高、開後大户求供均屬限價、形勢雖略不振、但上落極微、一天間僅有二角起仆、今將一天市况誌後、</p>
<p>晨開爲一一五五元六角、較前收好起二角、洽豐永慶發永賣至五元四角、滙豐掛牌英美仍平、大德成趁低略進、升爲五元半、平衡税小二五、慶發永仍有供給、午收爲一一五五元四角、</p>
<p>後市開盤一一五五元半、洽豐永乾昌祥賣至五元四角、福興永趁低納條、收盤仍爲一一五五元半、一天間計有二角盤旋、結果較前收升二角、</p>
<p>結價因中央標凖標金價掛牌升爲一一五六元四角、照收盤價言、約撳一元不到、現貨市况平定、烚赤賣價十五元半、買價十二元、天津貨照加十四元、而無成交、掉期昨因空方需貼進二角、各方仍在觀望中、缺少對做、</p>
<p>塲內交易有限、綜計大成福䦵永大德成元茂永略進、大德成慶發永洽豐永生源永乾昌祥稍出、三月份條子剩一千九百二十五條、共計多方六家、空方十二家、四月期籌碼計三千九百二十七條、共計多頭二十六家、空頭十三家、成交總數、計前市一百四十七條、後市九十一條、</p>

<h3>去年之絲業及今後應有之認識（二）</h3>
<p>— 朱筱和</p>
<p>二十五年度英美蠶絲進口及存消統計表（單位包額根據“Silk　Association　of　Amcpcia”所發表）</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>二十五年的上半期，一二月份絲市，藉上年歳底絲價騰漲之餘風，向能保持相當堅穩之行市。但此後絲市，即因紐約存絲之膨脹，及生絲消耗量之衰落，絲價逐漸下降。至六月底，各國平均絲價，幾皆跌至全年最低之售盤。蓋當時在收繭之前，日絲故意賤售新貨，以期捺低繭價，而同時大量意絲貶價運美求售之消息，亦次第披露，致絲市益形鬆疲，市塲情况大有供過於求之慨。價格方面，紐約現貨自一·八八七四元，降至一·五四六三元，横濱現貨、自八五一·九三元跌至六八四·三四元，里昂上海絲自七三·○二法郎跌至六二·六○法郎，倫敦華絲自七先令十一便士降至六先令二便士，上海絲市高級白廠自九五五元降至七四五元，A字白廠自九一五元跌至七一五元，B字等級則自八四五元跌至六八○元。其他雙宫輯里土絲等因上海手貨缺乏，致反見微漲者。六月份前之英美絲業狀况，上表當可知其大概。兹再觀中日兩國一年來之生絲輸出統計，可知去年之絲業，正吻合世界經濟初萎後榮之趨勢。在上半期一月份起，兩國出口絲額，即告下墜，與市價取同一途徑，終鮮轉機模樣。日本生絲輸出，在六月之前，則自一月份的三，八五○五担降至二，六四一六担，爲全年最短拙之担額。上海生絲之輸出數量，自一月份的二，七○二擔，至二月即已降爲一，二三七担，至五月底僅爲一，六一九担，較上年每月平均出口額减少二，九六六担之巨。</p>
<p>二十五年中日生絲輸出統計（單位担）</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>六月份開始後中外絲業，除生絲本身的新陳交替而前後軒輊外，其時世界生絲消費量漸增，市價因此上騰，以及新絲製成者尚少，存絲則漸感不足，絲市與六月前劃一分野。且七月初日本農林省發表是年日絲産量大减，預期收繭額爲三九，四九八，九九○貫，較上年减少百分之十六，次於大正十三年的最低産額三九，四七七，一六○貫，爲從未有之歉收記錄，於是日本鮮繭價格漲至五元八角之上，致有繭收减少繭值反增四千餘萬元之韻事。因此横濱絲價即告騰漲，七月後絲價已衝出七○○元關，至十月底再超過八○○元關，截至十二月底則已高騰至九一○元，爲全年最高之價格。美洲方面，六月後，紐約存絲即漸下减，至八月底僅剩二九，八二五包，計不足美國平時一月之需，故一般投機者及紡織商咸以高價吸收現絲、爲數至巨，而市上籌碼則更枯，又復因横濱價漲之影響，人心更趨高昂，截至美國大選告終，羅氏重返白宫後，美洲之工商業頓見振作，而每月生絲消費數量，亦復超出四○，○○○包水凖數額之上，直至年底未衰。同時絲價方面，亦維持每磅美金二元以上之記錄。歐洲方面因法郎突然宣布貶值，物價相率騰貴，絲市亦隨之扶摇直上，於十月初，里昂華絲A字等級者自七二法郎，一躍而升至九○·五○法郎，B字等級者自六六法郎漲至八四法郎，日本絲自六六法郎漲至八六法郎。而十月以後，復因日美絲價迭漲之影響，華絲A字再騰漲至九八·五○法郎，B字漲至九五·五○法郎，日絲則升至一○三·五○法郎，計平均激漲三分之一·下半年之國外絲市既如上述。吾人再一觀國內情形，江浙蠶絲，自二十一年淞滬戰爭之後，整個蠶絲業已形崩潰，而蠶桑區之農村經濟，亦陷於破産中，當時中央曾發行公債以爲救濟，而治本方面，復施以統制政策，五年來從官商利害交織中進行迄今，已漸有淸明成功之象。在蠶種方面、二十五年度，計浙江發種一百二十三萬張，江蘇一百三十萬張，四川山東安徽各四萬張，山西五千張，湖北一千張，共計二百六十五萬六千張，較初創時僅發種五萬張之數額，其進歩堪稱迅速。製絲方面，於下半年後，因鑒於國外絲銷轉機，絲價高昂，營業前途頗可樂觀，故絲廠與車數遂形激增，至八月份，計上海開工之絲廠達四十八家，車一一，一一八部，無錫三七家，車一一，八○二部，浙江二四家，車九九四部，共計一○九家，車二八，九一四部，爲全年最盛時期。絲價方面，自六月份至十一月份，高級白廠絲，漲至平均價水凖綫八五○元之上，爲八六五元。白廠絲A字爲八四七·五○元，B字爲八二五元，其他絲品，因日印商恊無效後，印商殊多轉購華絲，故輯里及雙宫絲之走銷，大見活躍，七里絲自五三○元升至七○○元，雙宫絲自三六五元漲至四四○元，均足爲全年高價記錄。上海生絲出口方面，則自五月份後即漸次增加，至十二月份爲七二九七包，爲一年來最高之數額。（未完）</p>

<h3>再會</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>「再會」！</p>
<p>他所喜歡的人，倚着自己佔有了的艙位，輕輕地揚了手勢，眼睛好像在看守着自己的衣袖；怎麽不肯望望他呢？他正在爲了留戀這次的别離，在眼角邊加多了幾條皺紋，他不也是她所喜歡的人嗎？</p>
<p>既是互相所喜歡的人，怎麽又勉强地離别呢？他們不是仍保持着完好的感情嗎？</p>
<p>他們還是在一月前來到這陌生的地方。在一條僻静的街旁租了一間房子，窗子靠近着草塲，有小樹，有菜畦，在草叢間的高大的院牆里，有希特勒與墨索里尼的兩面旗子，常常在那里飄起；附近，幾乎全是高貴人們的住所。從此也可以知道他們的房間是如何的華麗，他們生活如何的幸運中。並且在牆角下備好了面袋與米袋；所以他們歡快着，忙着探望這地方的新的景物，有時候，直到夜深，才回來。</p>
<p>不久，她到一個歌團學唱歌去了，他一個人留在家里看書，或是去訪舊日的朋友。於是，在幾天里他所有的朋友都知道他回來了，並且也都知道他領來一個新識的姑娘。不知爲什麽朋友都來看看那個姑娘；每個朋友來了的時候，都是隨着他們吃飯，有時候，他們吃過飯，他特意又給朋友從外邊買飯來，或是自己另做了一次。在朋友走後她常常這樣問他：</p>
<p>「那個朋友是做什麽的」？</p>
<p>他的回答，總是不出這幾句話：</p>
<p>「寫稿子的」。</p>
<p>或是：</p>
<p>「作家」。</p>
<p>她聽了他的話，她常常自語着：</p>
<p>「作家，作家」！</p>
<p>在她純潔的心上，祗知道贊揚着這「作家」的高貴的名詞。</p>
<p>半月以後，他所認識的朋友，幾乎都來過了。如果有一兩個朋友，來了的時候，恰好她不在家；在他告訴她的時候，她便問：</p>
<p>「也是作家嗎」？</p>
<p>「是的，是的」！</p>
<p>有一次，她突然反問他一句：</p>
<p>「他們怎麽都餓着肚子呢」</p>
<p>他默默地没有回答她。她以爲他没有聽見，又另説一句：</p>
<p>「他們都餓着肚子嗎」？</p>
<p>「是的，是的」！</p>
<p>她有些奇怪，因爲她生長在富人的家庭，她很少知道在她以外的人的生活。這次是在偶遇的機會里，任着自己的感情，從家里偷了些錢隨他逃脱出來，所以她又問</p>
<p>「他們怎故麽都餓着肚子呢」</p>
<p>他仍没有回答她；同時她看他那種神情，也不再問他什麽。</p>
<p>從此她看見他的朋友，便先問：</p>
<p>「你餓嗎」？</p>
<p>漸漸地她好像成了一句習慣語：</p>
<p>「你餓嗎」？</p>
<p>這已經問到他的身上來了，同時，她也應當同樣地問她自己了。</p>
<p>「我們怎麽也都餓着肚子呢」？</p>
<p>她也不回答他，彷彿已經明白了飢餓者所有的原因。</p>
<p>最後，他們不得不在飢餓中别離了，他送她走上那向她故鄉駛去的海輪。</p>
<p>他們握握手，離開了。他在岸上，她在船上，岸與船間的一條海水隔着他們互相説一句：</p>
<p>「再會」！</p>
<p>然而他們誰也没有説出某年某日是他們再會的時日。</p>
<h3>童心</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>自從妻入院生産之後，家里的孩子照顧上的責任就全放在我的身上了。才兩歳的孩子，每天跟媽媽在一處厮混慣了，這時突然不見了媽媽的踪跡，自然免不了要過分的想念。本來，我决心犧牲了每日的工作，完全把時間放在照看孩子上，但有時還是照看不好他，他玩着玩着，嘴里就喊起媽媽來，看着媽媽的像片，就大聲喊着「要媽媽」，一個孩子對於媽媽的親切處真是筆墨所不能述説的。到後來，當他盼不回媽媽時，自己就連聲哭叫着：「媽媽没有了。」於是，這難人解脱的苦衷，就廹得我心火交加，而感到應付上的棘手了。這孩子，爲了思念媽媽，簡直不理會爸爸的誑哄，而且還不住聲呌着：「不要爸爸，不要爸爸！」這，儘管我把他平日所最喜歡的故事和吃食全説出來，想討他的歡心，也不可能，直到他閙完這一陣爲止。</p>
<p>但白天，究竟還好過，來幾個朋友，人多些，他也就可以把想念媽媽那一副心事忘記了，冬天本來天短，厮混一會，日子就過去了，到了黑天，就發生了難題；屋子里冷淸淸的，静悄悄的，不但孩子容易想到媽媽，就是我這作爸爸的也爲這異乎尋常冷落的新環境而不自主地回想到前此屋中的情景，和病房中的産婦。平日，孩子緊挨着媽媽睡在一只大床上，這一來，床上少了一個人，逃不出孩子真切的記憶和回想，他「要媽媽」的口號因而愈發喊得起勁，同時也愈發顯得悲慘，累得我這以爸爸身分兼作媽媽的人束手無策。</p>
<p>因此，我在想：孤兒的悲哀，恐怕只有孤兒才能體味到吧。</p>
<p>好容易費了一些知慧，算是把孩子哄睡，看一看時間，已然到了九點半鐘，比起平日他睡覺的時候足足晚了一個半鐘頭，這一點點的歉疚，應該由誰來負呢？孩子睡得並不熟，過一會，睜開眼睛，朝各處望上一望，過一刻又會在夢中喊上幾聲「媽媽，」過些時又會不自主地哭出聲來。我不能替孩子解除他對媽媽的懸想，因而自己很爲焦燥。</p>
<p>當我睡到床上時，便覺得身上浮來無限的疲憊，頭腦里面昏沉沉的，一身上下正如服了一天煩重的勞作，各箇骨節全有些酸痛，我在深深地出了一口長氣之後，不禁暗想道：作母親，這工作很艱深，而且，很累人。對於我這初次作母親職務的人，由於多方面的不熟習，自然要不自主地發出這般的感覺來。</p>
<p>夜里，睡醒一覺時，孩子醒來了，他找尋他的媽媽，哭個不停。先是伸出手，在身旁各處亂摸了一陣，没有摸到他盼待的人，就把眼睛睜開了，胡亂望了望，接着呌起來：「媽媽，媽媽不來，不要爸爸。」他直往後推我，眼淚一滴滴往外流。拿什麽玩意兒給他玩，説什麽好話給他聽，也没有用，他只是口不停聲地直哭直呌，直到哭得疲倦了，才半掩着眼睛睡了過去。</p>
<p>我是何等着急！妻在醫院要住十天才能出院，十天之內，若是孩子天天這樣吵閙，可如何是好？我發愁。於是，我想到没有主婦的家庭和没有媽媽的孩子，話中間的缺憾，遠非短時間所可彌補，這中間的煩亂也很可驚人。</p>
<p>意外的，想不到兩天過去之後，孩子完全習慣了這新的環境和生活，他跟我一道玩，一道吃喝，一道睡覺，他偶而説起媽媽來，也不哭不叫，一會就過去了。這使我放了心。但有一宗，孩子表面上雖然找尋媽媽的情勢緩和些，骨子裏很顯然的他並没有忘懷他的媽媽，他常常半天半天一聲不出默想着，常常還像故意的聲明着：「不説媽媽，」「不要媽媽，」但他的臉上却不見了從前的笑容。這中間，自然有他的道理在。</p>
<p>朋友們來時，他們衆口同聲説孩子瘦了，並稱讚孩子的乖頴，若是他天天喊媽要媽，也叫大人們没有辦法。孩子瘦，我看不出來，因爲我天天在他面前，没個比較處。但如真有些瘦，那一定與他那被稱讚的乖頴有關，他是跌在相思裏。這，不免給我這自以爲盡好了爲母責任的爸爸，內心裏受到了大大的打擊。孩子並没有忘記他的媽媽，孩子反而比前幾天更在想念起他的媽媽，他所以不説出聲來，那是説明他小小的心田裏也知道怎樣壓制自己不快的感情這回事情了。</p>
<p>我能用什麽方法才可以醫好孩子這種病症呢？或是，聽其自然讓他自然發展呢？若真是設身處地爲孩子想一想，那我就該替孩子悲哀，惟其因爲孩子不説出口來，使得我這作爸爸的愈發難過。我曾經向一些朋友們問過計，問他們有没有妙法可以使孩子恢復過從前的歡快；我也問過專以治病爲能事的醫生，問他們使用什麽良藥可以醫好孩子內心的憂鬱症，可是他們全不能給我一個滿意的答覆，這不禁使我更爲孩子添了一層憂鬱。既然人人没有辦法，那我也就只有聽其自然了。</p>
<p>於此，我感到母親對於孩子的需要是如何的密切。爸爸施給孩子的愛，是怎樣的不受孩子的歡迎，相反的母性的愛的孩子的身上却能得到孩子　端的擁戴。</p>
<p>這期間，我每天還要分出一些時間，到醫院中去看孩子的媽媽，那癱軟得棉花糖一般的産婦。每次坐在病榻旁邊，妻第一句話總是問孩子在家裏好不好，然後就問飯吃得多不多，想不想媽這麽一大套。那種關心不忘的樣子，正是發揮着母性對於子女的懸念與垂愛。我什麽都照實説，只是不説孩子的消瘦，她每次聽完之後，總是帶着懷疑的神情反問道：「是真的麽？孩子這樣省事麽？」依着平常她在孩子身上所得的經騐説，她不相信孩子會這樣馴順，不會聽憑媽媽的失蹤而不追究，因爲在平日，孩子是一刻也離不開他的媽媽。妻也不能不信我的話，我一向未在她面前説過謊，到後來他因此還替孩子歡喜，那時也就不自主地説道，「孩子真能這樣，將來回家之後那可省事多了，也不會總纒着我不放。這孩子，想不到他竟然這樣聽話，這樣可愛。」</p>
<p>這樣的繼續到第九日，我抱着孩子到醫院中去接孩子的媽媽，坐在車裏，我連連跟孩子説，到什麽地方，去作什麽事情，孩子聽完，並未像我所預料的那般喜形於色，他却是楞了一陣，像在想什麽事情，過一會，才慢慢説：「接媽媽，媽來了，」説的不關痛癢，叫我都有些懷疑起來。當媽媽坐到車上時，趕忙抱過孩子去，頭一句話就是「孩子瘦了。」是的，我知道他瘦了，孩子却在這時緊緊摟住媽媽親着嘴，我望着懷中托着的另一個小生命而在發着呆。</p>

<h3>身邊雜事的描寫</h3>
<p>— 王任叔</p>
<p>彷彿曾經有一個時候，有人非難過身邊雜事的描寫。主要的意思是：處在這樣的一個偉大的時代裏，一個作家要是僅僅爲自己的細鎖的事，咿唔沈吟，若不勝其感慨，絮絮地描寫出來，那一定脱離了時代，作品的社會的價值，將等於零。……身邊雜事的描寫，無疑是政治的文學底否定。</p>
<p>由於身邊雜事描寫的否定，反映到中國文學的作品里的現象，是怎樣的呢？在我看來，彷彿更深入於身邊雜事式的描寫了。</p>
<p>這説來也許有點奇怪。但追求其原因，却是必然的。當初——也許現在還有——反對身邊雜事的描寫，已經説過，那是於它的內容與形式上之個人主義。且爲要强調一個作者，必須把住大時代，所以有非從反對身邊雜事的描寫入手不可。然而時代底把握，决不僅憑於世界觀，須有更深切的實踐；不僅要自己溶入於大時代里，而尤須大時代溶化在自己心里。通過自己，而表現這時代，那才能説得到「把握住了！」身邊雜事的描寫，一般説來，是自然主義的描寫方法。它的主題與題材的汲取，不是由於作者的主觀與社會的客觀起了種化合作用，而是以主觀混合一些卑細的客觀的事實，或僅僅由於無法把握的客觀，刺激着主觀的一種反撥，自然地發抒出來的。在這一點上説，作品中確也能表現出一些主觀的「真摯」。尤其是這種作品，一觸到人類愛的時候，頗能深深打動讀者的心。黎列文的崇高的母性，許景宋紀念魯迅的文字，在其性質上説，應是身邊雜事的描寫吧！然而，我幾次讀了，幾次流下淚來。而且叫人流淚的，總是在作者寫時也許是流着淚的那些句上。</p>
<p>叫人流淚的作品，也許不一定是好作品。然而無論如何它是具備了成爲一種文學作品的必要條件了——感情的傳染。在這一點上説，真摯——也許是身邊雜事的描寫的優點吧。但身邊雜事的描寫的劣點，却也很多；那就是：瑣碎，感想化了，把握現實的歪曲，或者，把現實片段化了。而且，一貫的精神，總脱不了傷感，顯示個人的無力，同時，也消滅了人類的進取心與鬥爭心。給予讀者的印象——是空虚。</p>
<p>但不幸在反身邊雜事的描寫的作者羣里，而自己所採取的手法，也還踏襲身邊雜事式的自然主義的手法。固然，他們爲避免身邊雜事式的描寫，大都是採用了第三人稱的寫法。努力避去作者出面。或説話。但他用以塑鑄作品主人公的材料，也極其瑣細，猥葸，甚至於公式化。這原因就由於作者個人的經騐的狹小。或由於作者根本没有經騐，僅憑聽聞的傳説。或竟由於作者讀了幾本理論書籍，以甲代表資本家的理論體系，以乙代表勞働者理論體系——那樣地搭空架子的創作法。那麽，雖然作者怎麽努力用第三人稱的寫了出來，而這個主人公却先已成爲身邊雜事的堆積了。主人公成爲一堆積木，而不是有魂靈的活人。</p>
<p>這樣説來，年來反身邊雜事的描寫的結果，反而强調了身邊雜事的描寫的劣點，——鎖碎。而忘却身邊雜事的描寫的　劣——真摯。</p>
<p>我自然不想來掩蔽自己的錯誤。四五年來，要是我也有寫作的話，我是力避着自己的苦痛與傷感而卜筆的。爲了生活給予我的無比的創痛，我也曾想寫些發洩自己的胸襟的東西，但總覺得這給予人的，將會是一貼毒藥，我就尅制着，而寫些另一種的與自己生活有相當距離的東西。現在想來，這就成爲我寫作的致命傷。固然，以自己的創痛，去傳染給别人，在某一意義上説，也許是罪惡的。對於這樣衰老的民族，難道還允許以傷感去振動它底神經嗎？不過我的工作總是錯了。在這里，我固然應該克制自己的感傷。但我却更應該冷静地把這種生活的傷，予以客觀的分析，推究社會的原因，使在一個倒敗的傷兵後面，展開了一幅社會的實景。這時，作者與被分析的自己，保持着相當距離，予以描寫；而被分析的自己——一個客觀的存在，却又深切而緊廹地，通過作者的思想與感情。也許這被分析的自己——一個客觀的存在，是作者的本質的思想與感情的敵人，但即使這樣來打擊自己，撲滅敵人；然而作者在努力顯示真實的畫面這一點上，作者是達到了創作的最高成就了。</p>
<p>據我想，魯迅的在酒樓上，和孤獨者，也許是在這樣的情景下寫成的吧。尤其是那孤獨者，每次讀時總每一句，甚至於每一字，給我以極大的壓廹力，魏連殳的蒼凉，彷彿也就是我的蒼凉。法朗士説每一篇作品，應是作者的目傳，我以爲，這話應該在這樣的場合來解釋的。</p>
<p>自然，現實主義的創作方法，應如昂格爾給馬格里特·哈克納爾的信里所説：「除Delal之正確以外，是典型的狀勢下的典型的性格之傳達。」而要做到這一點，更需要作者認識生活的深入，作家所要的，不是一點點憑空的世界觀，而是有正確認識的「世故」。人有稱魯迅爲「世故老人」的。魯迅在未深切研究馬·昂學説以前，而有那樣老輝的創作，一方面，固然是他有進歩的歷史的見解，而另一方面，就是在他懂得「世故」。懂得「世故」不是壞事懂得「世故」而校正之以前進的歷史的見解。這就使魯迅成爲世界少有的現實主義的作家。</p>
<p>但在中國創作界，一般地流於空泛，虚僞，瑣碎，卑俗與公式化的現在，我倒希望能返於「真摯」。那種描寫身邊雜事的真摯的態度，還是值得學習的，我以爲。</p>

<h3>統一與和平（續）</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>（七）然則民衆究竟要用什麽力量，才可以避免戰爭而帮助中央政府達到和平統一呢？我以爲不外下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）發揮輿論的權威　由於已往事實的昭示，如兩廣事變的解决，西安事變的轉機，都可以看出全國真正輿論的威力，真正的輿論决不産生於自命爲左派的幼稚病者，他們祇知道反政府反中央，不是説中央與敵人妥恊，就是説中央抗敵爲虚僞，甚至如北平的學聯會，受了西班牙京城瑪德里的學生會的指揮，在西安事變發生之初，竟然開會慶祝，喪心病狂，一至於此，那裏還認識時代，還會有什麽輿論？真正的輿論也决不産生於自命爲右派的狹隘病者，他們誠然知道目前中國人民應擁護政府、擁護首領，可是不懂得如何方能爲政府爲領袖在廣大的國民羣衆建築信仰的深厚基礎，如果逐漸離開了民衆，還有什麽輿論？真正的輿論，完全發生於全國無黨無派最大多數的民衆所有的常識和正義。兩廣事變，儘管陳濟棠輩假借什麽好名義，全國莫不嗤之以鼻，而陳乃不得不出走。西安事變，儘管張學良輩標榜什麽好名義，全國莫不恨之刺骨，而張乃不得不服罪。語云：「十目所視，十手所指，其嚴乎！」如果我們民衆絶不自暴自棄，一秉其爲國家爲民族而所持的常識與正義，威武不屈，富貴不淫，發揮其至公至正的輿論，則論鋒所及，對於任何野心軍閥和惡意政客所玩的破壞統一的陰謀，必能始終予以最嚴厲的打擊，其嚴厲的程度，豈但十目十手而已？輿論既有如此效用，實在可以算得國家走上民治化和現代的大道上一個重要的推動力，不但民衆應善爲發揮，即政府亦應倍加愛護。愛護之道，例如：時時將政治演進的情勢和國家政策的方針，直接的或間接的通知社會各階層領導的人們使他們相當明瞭以後，議論不致錯誤。此其一。在不違背建國最高原則，不詆毁中央最近國策的範圍以內，儘量寛放言論自由的路，使民意藉以宣揚，下情得以上達，發揮善意的批評，淘汰惡意的誹謗。此其二。同時，在此非常時期，對於危害國本，反抗政府，麻醉青年，誤入歧途的漢奸刋物，不問其受何種帝國主義的嗾使，自應一律斷然取締，俾不復爲害羣之馬。須知禁止危害的言論，即所以愛護純正的輿論。此其三。果能政府與民衆一致重視公正坦直的輿論、不但任何軍人政客不敢再冒大不韙以破壞統一，即國家的民治基礎，亦將很堅固的建築起來。</p>
<p>（二）完成法治的機構　中國必待統一完成而後可躋於現代國家之林誠然，但現代國家的起碼條件必是一個法治的國家。英美法等國無論已，即如蘇俄以無産階級專政而建國的，現在也論起法治來了，不但有他們的憲法而且有新憲法，至於制裁他們幹部派所謂的反動份子，也無不假手於法庭。又如意，如德的所謂法西斯國家，如日本的傾向於法西斯國家，也都有他們的憲法，並且都辯護他們的政制是最合於民治精神。日本的軍部幾已横衝直撞，無所不然，然二二六事變之後，不能不繼之以法律的「肅軍。」故要做到國家的和平統一，非盡力提高法律的威信不可。「王子犯法，庶民同罪，」必有這種法律之前人人平等的統一精神，而後國家始有和平統一可言。若一味遷就事實，漠視法律，則綱紀掃地，秩序難保，一時的統一還是紙糊的。如欲實現法治，則完成法治的機構必不可緩。下列客端，都應限期實踐：（一）召集國民大會頒布憲法，使全國上下共同誓守此根本大法。（二）各省市分别加緊推進地方自治，使民治的下層基礎鞏固。（三）各級法院的系統機構，應在短時期內整理完成。（四）各級法院的檢察制度，應力求完滿，使檢察官能充分行使職權，代表國家檢舉一切犯罪事件。（五）各級政府用人，遵守考試銓叙的法規，俾得人盡其才。（六）厘定政府各機關的權職，許其分工合作，防其越職侵權；在非軍事區域內，對於現役軍人干涉地方行政，尤應懸爲厲禁。</p>
<p>（三）加速經濟的建設　以中國之廣土衆民，而欲鞏固統一，首先非有四通八達的鐵道網，公路網，航路網，電信網不可；故鐵路，公，航運，航空，郵電，及電播等各種交通事業的建設，在最短期間，應用全民衆的力量，帮助政府迎頭趕上。交通發達，勢必産生真正的統一。其次，必使貨幣政策，穩定推行，農村復興，工業發達，然後國民的經濟生活，可望脱離封建時代的形態，而達於工商業資本時期的國民經濟階段，構成一整個經濟單位。一般國民的經濟生活，如果因民族根本的經濟建設而促成其聯繫，則榮枯相共，利害相同，各省市的民衆在物質生活上必然確立了親愛精誠的基礎，其擁護統一的力量，斷非任何勢力所可摇動的了。</p>
<p>總之，「統一」是中國目前的第一需要；和平「統一」尤其是中國目前的普通希望。「統一」之是否真能　成。「和平統一」之是否確能保持，我們民衆萬萬不可忽視自身的力量。論語説，「我欲仁，斯仁至矣。」我玉在可仿照説一句：「民衆欲統一，斯統一矣；」「民衆欲和平統一，斯和平統一矣。」（完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>獸性的殘餘</h3>
<p>— 珞珈</p>
<p>記不起在那一本書里，大概總是談戀愛的吧。據説在失戀之後，或者在受了重大的刺激，無論男的或女的發生一種變態的舉動，也可以説是心理上的病狀，呌做「逼害狂」。這種病狀是以殘酷的手段對付他（或她）所愛好的對方以取樂，譬如重力鞭打，使對方遍體鱗傷；或嚙咬對方的頸項，或身體的某一部份，至流血而後止。筆者對於戀愛素無研究，既没有失戀，也没有受過重大刺激，心理上的變態病狀「逼害狂」倒底因何而發生，發生後的情形何若？當然無從知道：而且這種「逼害狂」的變態病狀除在書本上看到之外，即使美國式的戀愛電影中也没有見到過，或許這種病狀比之「自殺」「跳樓」更進一歩，非普通人在喊着「上帝啊，我的愛人呢？」的時候就會「逼害」起來的。</p>
<p>不過我知道，人類雖然已經穿起了大禮服，和把頭髮燙成飛機式，可是原始時代的野蠻性還是潛伏在他們的軀殻之內，在神經失常的時候，馬上會暴露他們的獸性，以最殘酷的手段施之於最憎恨或最愛好的對方而滿足刹那間的慾望。這種情形如果發生在戀愛塲面上，或許就是「逼害狂」了。其他害神經病的人往往喜歡打架，殺人，放火；一個久病的人一旦脱離病榻的時候，大概總是咒詛醫生，而發生殺盡天下醫生的奇想…</p>
<p>然而奇怪的是，在神經正常的時候，那種殘酷的獸性還是在暴露着，舉個例罷，看殺頭，看槍斃就是。那個犯人和看的人有什麽關係呢？而鼓掌喊好，不遺餘力，好像都和被殺的人有不共戴天之仇似的。其理由就在「白刀揮動，鮮血直流」，「槍聲一響，應聲倒地」，的殘酷塲面能够滿足他們的慾望。</p>
<p>二十一日哈瓦斯電：墨西哥瓜達拉哈拉省「進歩鬥牛塲」，本日節目爲猛獅與雄牛相鬥，事先以動人詞句，大登廣告，以資號召，羣衆果爲所動，屆時購票入座者，極爲擁擠。迨至登塲，則所謂雄牛者乃係小犢一頭，未及抗鬥，猛獅即張饞吻，吞而食之。觀衆始知受紿，羣情憤激，頓時磚石紛飛，亦有開放手槍者，最後則羣起縱火，將該牛塲付之一炬云。</p>
<p>西班牙有鬥牛，是人所共知的，猛獅與雄牛相鬥，雖不是人，其情形也是一樣的，因爲觀衆們要看的是流血的慘劇。現在該小犢未及抗鬥，猛獅即張饞吻，血當然也流的，但是太不動人，太不緊張了。牛獅相鬥既不能滿足他們的慾望，就償之於火燒牛塲了。</p>
<p>某些人就喜歡看火燒的，不過呌做「隔岸看火」，在名稱上「文明」一點罷了。</p>

<p>星期六的下午，有一班廣九快車從大沙頭開出了，轟隆轟隆地像一條餓狠了的毒蛇，在發了狂般的箭樣穿過了田野。機關車頭在不停地冒着烟，和嘯着汽笛聲。一會見，車駛進了「石龍站」了，而一會兒又穿出了站台，連休息也不長久地便又飛奔着向前了。</p>
<p>前面是碧綠一片的田郊，有山有樹，也有小河溪，兩旁植滿了農人們辛苦地爲有錢人預備的禾稻，在隨風飄蕩着，景緻很不錯。這兒是跟一般南方的鄉村一樣的散佈着惹人愛的近亞熱帶的氣息。—可是，這一切怡人的景迹便是這麽地提不起車上的旅客們的興趣。是啦，他們每個星期六這時候都打從這兒經過，可却從没注意過這些，他們的心思决不會有這麽閒情逸緻地落在這些見慣了的東西上面去……</p>
<p>那麽，他們的心緒這時在哪兒呢？—從車窗孔眼那裏瞧出去，那一根接着一根的電綫桿，不是嗎，它們在向後退，飛快地向後退，一根接着一根，一根接着一根，是飛快地，不！太慢了，不該更快一點嗎？</p>
<p>在這前面，便有他們的希望了，他們在凝想着在那兒的快樂，那簡直不能語給别人聽的快樂啦！</p>
<p>二等車廂裏，没幾個客人。有三四個紅毛人（英國人）是架着没柄的金絲銀鏡在看那横排的英文報；也有一兩對年青的情侣，緊緊地擠在一起，地上横着兩件小行李；一個小旅行篋，和一個女人手袋。餘外便是靠窗的，靠板壁的，在凝想着的不是旅客的旅客了。</p>
<p>空氣給他們這一班不愛説話的傢伙，弄得有點兒冷悄悄的。除了那些情侣們在咬耳根般絮絮地談着一些永遠説不完的話，甚麽人也是静默的。那幾位靠着座位的凝想的人，很像相互間都有着同一的心思一樣，都是一付姿態。那付姿態是這樣的：眼不是朝着天空，便是釘準了鼻樑。眼珠子似呆定着，也像骨碌碌地旋轉。心兒一定不是呆在眼看的地方，而是……</p>
<p>在那老遠的前方吧！不是老遠，快要是眼前的東西了。停一會，這快車便會停在那兒，那時候他們便再甚麽也不想了，只要看見那兒的一切，他們便會不再是一個沈默的，凝想的人了。</p>
<p>他們也許在回憶吧，那一定還是上一個星期六的事。他們很會原諒自己：對啦，那不全是自己不好，那是命運作怪，命運一定要他「輸」，他可怎能會不輸，不是嗎？看這一次吧—連本帶利的……</p>
<p>有些嘴角還牽上一絲微笑，他們是樂天派，他們把上星期日晚上坐三等車回來的事看作笑話—大丈夫能屈能伸！要是手氣好，青龍白虎，給一個「獨贏」你看：老子不乘頭等車嗎？但是，話只管這樣説，這班旅客們却從没有一個是坐頭等車返省城的。</p>
<p>想，當然隨便甚麽地方也可以想得到的，但是想的機會太多了時，那也是得麻煩的。於是，一個是在向他的旅伴焦急地問着：「喂，怎麽今天車頭没吃飯嗎？還不到深圳，等得人要命哇！」</p>
<p>「二跳四落一，一，一，還是一，這呌你没方法，又不是自己想的！」—這個回答得很像有點牛馬不對馬嘴，但是他們關於這些懂得太多了，一點也不覺得奇突地，大家嘶開嘴，笑一笑，又把心思抛向窗外，抛到深圳去了。只有在那兒，他們才有閒心來説閒話，這兒可不成。</p>
<p>一會兒，汽笛呱哇的狂呌起來了。一個大草棚的影子閃在他們的面前了。聲音是出乎人意料之外地嘩啦嘩啦地響起來，幾個西人向這兒瞥過一忽驚奇的眼光。這時，車慢下來了，而且駛進了站台，一個寫着站名的牌子是衝進人的眼簾了。車掌在大聲地喊着：</p>
<p>「深圳！深圳……」</p>
<p>跟着，人都衝了下去了，車廂裏已没有了那些不是旅客的旅客。</p>
<h3>惶惑</h3>
<p>— 汪聲天</p>
<p>年老的母親，從鄉下寄來一封信説：</p>
<p>「……上海的女子要不得，阿四不是因爲女人連書都讀不成？我想你是知道的，並且你是兄弟中懂事的一個……張家派人來説親，我想你現在已經二十來了，這份親事，定起來，是門當户對的……」</p>
<p>不要説老婆，我想伴侣是應該要的；由這封信的提示，於是我關心到「女人」的身上來！</p>
<p>每夜我打開書卷，到更殘燭盡的時候，好像有什麽孤寂追射我。看高爾基的作品時，好像裏面的女主人翁比平時增加了，而且她們又被寫得那樣的美麗，嫵媚；「女人是人類煩惱中永遠的母親。」高爾基説的這一句話，時時刻刻在我的腦子里！我想，這是什麽鬼？但是自己又没有答案！</p>
<p>每天我仍舊挾着書包，到學校裏去和黑板，粉筆碰頭，携手，以前，我總是一個子在教務處，隨便同事怎樣有趣味的喧嘩，我都不參加，等到打鐘了，我上課，下課；前天，聽見一個老同事談起對於女人的事情不知道怎麽樣，我便下意識地插嘴問：「你對於女人作何見解？」</p>
<p>「哈哈…」他聽見我問這句話時，大笑了一陣，不久，静静地見了我一眼説：「……我有一個同學説，養一個女人好比買一頭牛來吃牛奶……一頭牛買來要給它房住，吃，照應……然後有牛奶吃，但是，不買牛的人也有牛奶吃的，在上海這地方吃得更新鮮的，毋論是蝶牌，還是A字消毒……」</p>
<p>太陽落山的時候，我乃舊拖着身子抛進亭子間去，明知道是初春了，不久又是困人的天氣，習慣會使人受累，受苦；從今天起應該絶念！</p>
<p>「女人是怎樣的東西啊？他們是那麽地美，柔；我知道的波德萊爾曾細膩地寫畫過她們的給人的醉迷……」</p>
<p>這個問題没有解答，我只是迷惑地有時裝裝很儍的樣子，好讓它輕忘過去</p>
<h3>名醫大聚會</h3>
<p>— 羣英</p>
<p>我們知道「名伶大會串」，是集合有名的藝員，登台演唱各人拿手的戲曲，看這種大會串，必定覺得有聲有色，精神百倍！</p>
<p>現在，又有了「名醫大聚會」，這是一回甚麽事呢？原來海上著名的醫生，像內外科名醫刁信德，譚以禮，駱傳榮，虞心炎，王耆齡，翁煦修，徐新伯。花柳科名醫李景文，眼科名醫張福星，牙科名醫周家肇，腸胃科名醫朱寳麟，泌尿科名醫陳邦典，痔瘡科名醫葛經，他們都在四馬路五洲大樓內懸牌應診，因爲五洲大樓內的診室都是由專家設計的，完備的診室，使著名的醫師得各展所長，而病家也就知所問津了。</p>
<h3>閨怨</h3>
<p>— 珍妮</p>
<p>閨房是婦女居住的地方，因爲是在內室，所以又稱「深閨」，大家的婦女，普通也稱「閨秀」。</p>
<p>「閨怨」就是説婦女的怨恨，從古來到現在，婦女總是比較男子多怨，這原因不外婦女多静少動，以致引起生理上的病態，像月經不調，體弱血虧，都能使她陷入悲觀悒鬱的狀態。不過古代的時候，因爲醫藥不倡明，所以有許多閨中的婦女，都含怨以終！現代有靈效的藥物，譬如服「月月紅」，就能通經活血，平肝消鬱，使月事通暢有序。服「女界寳」就能養血調經，滋補虚損，使紅顔永駐，這兩種藥都是五洲藥房的出品。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>……昨天，又是更殘燭盡的時候了，我昏暈欲睡，料不到一條小花貓却在我的床邊「和……」的一呌，害我疑心地爬起來，把蠟燭一照，小花貓的脚爪下正爪住一隻老鼠，眼珠子烏瞅瞅地看住我，鮮血淋淋，等我把蠟燭放在桌上的時候，我正像雷打一般的昏迷，淸醒！</p>
<p>看看錶已經兩點鐘，在寢室一轉，腦子裏想想「又是失眠的時候了！」</p>
<p>隨手在書架上拿出來一本書，契訶夫隨筆，一翻就是：「女人没有男人做伴侣就憔悴了，男人没有女人做伴侣就愚拙了！」「男子不能以一吻，求得女人的心的，也就不能用武力把她的心得來。」</p>
<h3>抓賭</h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>我由于家回來，中途遇上大雪，黄昏時候到了家，凍得手脚都僵了，媽呌我睡到熱坑上好好的煖一煖，躺了一陣，凍了的地方，現在那塊肉便發癢，打了兩噴，脊背仍然像披着冰，媽摸摸我的頭，説滾燙的，我迷迷糊糊地就睡了。</p>
<p>睡着睡着，外面吵嚷起來，我聽了會越來聲音越高，我不耐煩的打被窩里探出頭來，問媽：</p>
<p>「幹麽吵這樣兇？」</p>
<p>「他們在車屋里賭錢呢。」</p>
<p>「不怕抓賭的？」</p>
<p>「大正月間，他們找了幾個人，打伙計在公安局里包了的。」</p>
<p>「多少錢呢！」</p>
<p>「一個牌九案子，一天八塊錢。」</p>
<p>吵鬧的聲音更大了，忽然乒乒乓乓的亂嚮，夾雜着</p>
<p>「拿槍打，……」</p>
<p>「捉住！捉住！拉住他的腿！」</p>
<p>突的，打媽肩膀上射過一道電光來，正照着我的眼，接着一個警察很野蠻的把我拉出被來，我打了個冷戰，趕快跳下坑，揑住他的胳膊問：</p>
<p>「幹麽扯我？」</p>
<p>他一句話也不答，抓起我的棉被來搜口袋，那里我有四塊八毛錢，他一閃身子就塞到自己褲襠里，扭轉身揪住我的頭髮往門外拉。</p>
<p>俺爹正在房門口跟那個黑皮耗子（我們這里管廵警呌溜街狗或黑皮耗子）你推我，我推你，誰也弄不開誰。</p>
<p>跟我打的這個廵警，因爲讓我老駡他强盗駡惱了，拉住我的小褂袖子，荷荷地喘着嚷：</p>
<p>「咱去見廵長！還了得！」</p>
<p>我想跟他去説説理，便鞋也没穿的就跟他走到外間屋，原來這個廵長就在門外等着呢。我告訴他那個小子搶了我的錢，還無緣無故的揪我的頭髮，他像没長耳朶，一隻手指着我，蹶着個嘴呌喊：</p>
<p>「你們怎麽不給我抓他，抓他呀！」</p>
<p>爹額角上滴着血，走過來説：</p>
<p>「廵長老爺，我家這個兒子，剛打外鄉回家，正發寒熱，有什麽大事小情我去就是。」</p>
<p>像賣魚的一樣，一大半賭博鬼用麻繩拴着胳膊，廵警在後邊拿皮鞭子打那不愛走的漢子。有的人正咭咭咕咕地抱怨：</p>
<p>「我説壓了末手就走，你非再壓一方不成！」</p>
<p>「莊家起了四個點吃通……嘆，這繩子拴鬆點行不？老總們！」</p>
<p>「放你媽的屁！快走！」</p>
<p>第三天局里送了條子來，説呌預備六塊錢的罰金，後半晌媽把她倍嫁時那付銀鐲子送到小押店里，換子五塊錢，直到街上的地保打三更，媽扶着爸爸才回來，他的兩個大腿全給打腫了，説是因爲少一塊的罰金。（冀東雜寫）</p>

<p>開篇「花月聯珠」</p>
<p>春江花月最繁華。月映花牆花月偕。花愛月明花愛月。月移花影月移花。花開待月琴停響。月裏催花鼓亂撾。滿地落花金萬字。一鈎新月玉丫叉。花花世界春常在。月月潮頭信不差。皓月一輪修玉斧。梅花三弄撥銅琶。江郎夢繞生花筆。張子游仙泛月槎。面似桃花眉如月。水中明月鏡中花。好憑月老傳鴛諜。爲倩花奴拾鳳。拜月焚香情正切。葬花瘞玉恨無涯。荻花秋月潯陽客。孤月梅花處士家。月殿掃興鸞尾帚。花階立月鳳頭鞋。水中撈月空成話。霧裏看花興自佳。桅月懷人悲月榭。簪花及第歩大街。素娥桂月宫中住。玉女菱花鏡裏揩。欲捲珠簾籠夜月。爲删惡行灌名花。落花啼鳥春愁水。斜月殘燈夜夢賒。月裏種花防雨妬。花圓漏月爲雲遮。花叢酌酒遊蜂舞。月窟吹簫引鳳諧。月作重衾花作枕。花爲四壁月爲家。天花亂墜迷花影。秋月常圓看月華。冷月殘風春寂寞。閒花敗柳路横斜。白雲萬里關山月。碧血千年帝子花。有月無花真少趣。有花無月静無譁。從今後。花晨月夕送年華。</p>

<p>燕雙飛。夜闌人盡晚風寒。記得去年門巷。風景依稀。綠蕪庭院。細雨濕蒼苔。雕梁塵冷春如夢。且銜得芹泥。重築新巢傍翠幃。棲香憶。軟語呢喃話夕暉。差池雙翦。掠水穿簾去挽回。魂縈楊柳弱。夢逗杏花肥。天涯草色正芳菲。樓台静。簾幕垂。烟似織。月如眉。其奈流芳速。鶯花老。雨風催。景物全非。杜宇聲聲喚道不如歸。</p>

<h3>業餘戲劇俱樂部舉行歌舞之夜</h3>
<p>上海業餘戲劇俱樂部，（The　Amateur　Dramatic　Club　of　Shangbai）前晚假座蘭心戲院舉行「歌舞之夜」，節目俱極精彩，故雖天雨，而中外來賓，仍紛至沓來。第一個節目有莎翁名劇「威尼斯商人」，演員均屬外僑；第二個節目，如「小青吊影」「漢宫秋月」「嫦娥奔月」「鴻鸞禧」等，則純粹由國人演唱。「小青吊影」爲粤曲，由劉夫人古裝淸唱，背景幽麗，歌聲淸脆，闔座鼓掌，「漢宫秋月」爲粤曲，樂器爲琵琶，洋琴，簫，二胡等四種，亦極抑揚頓挫之妙；「嫦娥奔月」則爲一美妙之舞劇，由董夫人主演；「鴻鸞禧」則與熊式一所改編之「王寳川」相彷彿，此劇唱做俱佳，而情節尤極緊凑，爲是晚最動人之節目云。</p>
<h3>國泰映「開國元勳」</h3>
<p>一部偉大緊張的歷史愛國巨片</p>
<p>西雲爾羅兹Cceil　Rhodes之於菲洲，等於克拉夫之於印度，（已在上海映過由考爾門主演的「兒女英雄」一片，就是寫克拉夫的故事的），同爲英國拓殖大功臣。羅兹以一個帶病的身體，遠走南菲洲，經之營之，不遺餘力，雖然醫生警告他死期將至，他漢不關心，勁敵阻撓他進取計劃，他絶不畏怯。他終於掌握着鑽石鑛産的權威，獲得了無數女人的芳心，征服了蠻荒之區，創造了一個帝國，　換了世界地圖的顔色，流芳百世，千古不朽。今日起在國泰大戲院開㬇的「開國元勳」Rhodes　of　Africa一片，就是描寫羅兹在南菲洲奮鬥一生的偉跡，和當時種族戰爭的劇烈，羅兹一角，係由第一流大明星華爾德許士頓主演，演來有聲有色。據説本片在紐約洛杉大戲院連映兩星期，賣座甚盛，轟動一時，即足證明本片的確有價值了。</p>
<h3>「富貴榮華」即景</h3>
<p>「富貴榮華，」雖然是一部從頭到底的滑稽片，但有許多很嚴肅的愛國塲面。</p>
<p>諷刺社會的黑幕，最好在不知不覺中表現出來，「富貴榮華」便做了這歩工作。</p>
<p>「富貴榮華」的演出，完全用一種輕鬆的方式，所以更能使觀衆接受。</p>
<p>有錢的人用錢應當用得當，「富貴榮華」里諷刺了守財奴，而且告訴了人用錢的方法。</p>
<p>導演文逸民，爲了趕拍「富貴榮華」，連農歷大除夕都没有休息，真可算得一位忠於藝術的信徒。</p>
<h3>贈送「追韓信」劇本</h3>
<p>將於二十八日出版戲劇新聞週刋，專載劇壇掌故，坤伶艶聞，梨園消息，及「影」「舞」「電臺」等新聞，零售每册五分，現優待讀者，凡附法幣五角，郵寄上海美租界塘山路新元吉里九十二號戲劇新聞社發行部定閲十期，奉送郵資，再送名伶麒麟童「追韓信」劇本一册，以一百名爲限，同時該社充實內容起見，徵求本外埠特約記者多人，先試稿三則，合函約面叙，薪金從豐。</p>

<h3>Sun Weiru Flew to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reporting to the Central Government on the Recent Situation in Shaanxi Province; Accompanying Military Officers Head to Ningbo to Meet Zhang; Wang Shuchang and Mo Dehui Returned to Nanjing Yesterday</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The new Chairman of Shaanxi Province, Sun Weiru, arrived in Nanjing by plane at 5 p.m. on the 25th. Mr. Sun is about forty years old, with a military uniform and a short beard, and looks full of energy. That evening, he first paid respects to President Yu, Vice President Kong, and Minister He, etc. On the morning of the 26th, he paid respects to Chairman Chiang, reporting on the recent situation in Shaanxi Province and asking for instructions on future policies. He will stay in Nanjing for about five or six days. Army Commander Deng Shishan did not come along because he was in Fengxiang. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Sun Weiru, in order to report to the Central Government on the recent situation in Shaanxi Province, specially brought with him Councilor Li Fanhou, Secretary General of the Northwest Political Training Office Mai Wenyu, Military Confucian Director of the 38th Army Wen Liangru, and Senior Staff Officer Wei Xiyan, etc. They arrived in Nanjing by Eurasia chartered plane at 5 p.m. on the 25th. More than 40 people, including Lü Chao and Li Zhigang, etc., went to the airport to welcome them. After Mr. Sun got off the plane, he went to the hotel to rest. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited him. According to him, since Director Gu arrived in Shaanxi, he has been discussing with Director Yang about the dispatch and stationing of various troops for days, and it has been basically settled. He said that since he had just taken office, all future facilities must be carried out in accordance with the instructions of the Central Government. This time, he came to Nanjing to pay respects to Chairman Chiang and various central authorities to report on the recent situation in Shaanxi Province and ask for instructions on future administrative policies, so that he can have guidance to follow. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Xi'an] Provincial Chairman Sun Weiru led his entourage Wei Xiyan, Li Fanhou, Jia Wenyu, Wen Tianwei, and others, a group of six people, along with Zhang's generals Deputy Army Commander Wu KeRen, Division Commander Li Zhentang, Division Commander Huo Shouyi, Division Commander Zhou Fucheng, Brigade Commander Tang Junrao, and Zhang's Chief of Staff Zhi Heng, etc., a group of seven people, took the Eurasia Aviation Company plane eastward on the 25th. More than 100 people, including Chairman Yu Xuezhong, Army Commander He Zhuguo, Provincial Secretary-General Du Bincheng, Director of Finance Xu Shifu, and Director of Public Security Wang Zongshan, etc., all went to the airport to see them off. The Eurasia giant aircraft No. 19 slowly took off amidst the music of farewell at 10:35 a.m. and immediately flew eastward. It is said that Chairman Sun will fly directly to Beijing for official business. During his absence from the province, all provincial affairs will be handled by Secretary-General Du Bincheng on his behalf. As for Zhang's generals, they will first fly to Shanghai, then go to Xikou to pay respects to Zhang Xueliang and await his presence. After a short stay, they will fly to Beijing to pay respects to Chairman Chiang and listen to instructions, and report on defense matters. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Army Commander of the 63rd Army Wu KeRen, Division Commanders Li Zhentang, Huo Shouyi, Zhou Fucheng, Tang Junrao, and Zhang's Chief of Staff Zhi Heng's representative, the 72nd Division Commander Guo Xipeng, a group of six people, arrived in Beijing on the same plane with Shaanxi Chairman Sun Weiru from Xi'an at about 4 p.m. on the 25th. Wu and the other six people flew back to Shanghai on the original plane at 5:15 p.m. and then went to Zhejiang to meet Zhang Xueliang, who was recuperating in Xikou. They will come to Beijing again within a few days to ask for instructions. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Wang Shuchang and Mo Dehui, who went to Xikou to meet Zhang Xueliang, returned to Nanjing on the 25th. They went to visit important central figures to report on their meeting with Zhang. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Shaanxi Provincial Commissioner Li Zhigang said that he and the Director of the Construction Department, Dian Baohua, will return to Shaanxi Province to take office after Chairman Sun comes to Beijing. The Xi'an Incident has been resolved, and everything has returned to normal. Director Yang is currently in Xi'an, and most of the troops are stationed north of the Wei River.

<h3>Tianjin Customs Held Anti-Smuggling Conference</h3>
<p>Tax Officer Mei Weiliang and Li Xing, etc., Attended; New Decisions on Smuggling Suppression and Liaison of Customs Officers</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At 10 a.m. on the 25th, Tianjin Customs held an important anti-smuggling conference. Participants included Tax Officer Mei Weiliang, Chief of the Anti-Smuggling Section Sha Bo, and Director of the Land Transportation Anti-Smuggling Headquarters Li Xing. New decisions were made on smuggling suppression and close liaison between land and water customs officers, and it was decided to form an armed squad to improve the effectiveness of smuggling suppression. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] On the 25th, Tianjin Customs intercepted two heavy-duty cars loaded with smuggled piece goods of rayon, a total of more than 300 pieces, in Xiaoxiyingmen in the suburbs of Tianjin. They were transported to the Customs warehouse and detained. At 3 p.m., more than 30 ruffians gathered at the Customs to make trouble. The French Patrol Police Bureau dispatched a large number of detectives to disperse them upon hearing the news. The Japanese Police Department also received the news and sent special agents to arrest six ruffians. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Tianjin Customs and the Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office for Land Transportation held a joint meeting on the 25th. Those present were Mei Weiliang, Li Xing, and Sha Bo, etc. Decisions were made on water and land liaison for smuggling suppression. Because customs officers are sometimes beaten while performing their duties, it is planned to form an armed squad to improve the effectiveness of smuggling suppression and protect the safety of customs officers. It is reported that the Finance Department's Inspection Office is currently responsible for handling railway smuggling in terms of smuggling deployment, and Tianjin Customs is in charge of water and land smuggling within the scope stipulated in the Customs regulations. In the future, after the establishment of the Inland Inspection Office, it will be responsible for investigating and suppressing river and highway smuggling in southern Hebei and northern Shandong. Therefore, although general smuggled goods can be smuggled out from here, it is feared that they will be difficult to escape due to the strict deployment in the inland. In addition, Tianjin Customs inspectors, etc., seized more than 300 pieces of smuggled goods in Xiaoxiguan on the morning of the 5th and confiscated them. However, ruffians gathered again in the afternoon to create disturbances and were driven away. Several people were arrested by the Japanese Police Department and taken back for interrogation.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of the Situation on the Border of Suiyuan</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Since the national army on the Suiyuan border achieved victory in the war of resistance, inflicting a major blow on the bandits in the Battle of Hongge'ertu and successively recovering Bailingmiao, the tense atmosphere has gradually eased. Although a certain party's covert actions are still being actively planned, the rectification of military preparedness and supplies has not been relaxed. However, the plan for a large-scale invasion has been held back. Even local conflicts are only in the form of guerrilla warfare, with multiple probes to distract us. For the past two months, the attention of people in the hinterland has been focused first on the Xi'an Incident and then on the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. Concern for the front line of national defense has been temporarily neglected. Now that internal arrangements are generally in place and overall unity is no longer a problem, the sentiment for consistent external resistance will be even stronger than before. The recent changes in the situation on the Suiyuan border really need to be reviewed.</p>
<p>A certain party has long harbored the intention of gradually encroaching on Chahar and Suiyuan. Even if they have been frustrated, they will not be reconciled. We should expect them to come up with even more cunning schemes. However, due to the general trend, they have recently had to hesitate somewhat. Although they have claimed to be approaching Zhangjiakou and Dushikou, and there have been rumors that Huan Dong will have a new attack, in fact, bandits and puppets have been retreating eastward from Shangdu and Kangbao. A large amount of military supplies stored in Zhangbei have also been transported back. Recently, it has been reported that most of the puppet troops in northern Chahar have retreated into the territory of Rehe, and the Zhangbei special affairs agency has also been withdrawn to Duolun. On the surface, the disaster on the Suiyuan border seems to be temporarily relieved. Unless there are special changes, the opportunity for renewed warfare can be avoided. The reasons why a certain party has temporarily abandoned its aggressive policy are: 1. The national army's defense is solid, and the local people are determined to fight to the death. 2. The whole country is filled with righteous indignation and is united in providing support. 3. The atmosphere of defection has suddenly become strong, making it impossible to control. 4. The power of the traitors has declined, losing its purpose of utilization. A certain party has always wanted to rely on the old trick of sleeping hands, reaping without sowing, and is reluctant to use its own strength for direct contact, fearing that the situation will become too rigid and turn into an unresolvable situation. Their psychology of worrying about gains and losses is not difficult for people to see. If the national army had not defended strongly at that time, the bandits and puppets would have been able to enter directly without arousing the lofty ambition of defection. If the national support had been scattered, a certain party would have seen through our weakness and would not have had the obvious concern of Japanese support. Therefore, the current fading of the fierce flames is due to: 1. The presence of people on the front line who swear to defend the country to the death. 2. The formation of a united front in the rear.</p>
<p>Understanding this, if we want to maintain the integrity of the country, we must not be at a loss. With a certain party's cunning and versatility, frequent smoke screens, and feints to the east and west are their tricks. Retreating in order to advance is unpredictable. We must not misjudge the current situation and embrace a complacent optimism. We must be prepared to deal with the situation at any time with unremitting murderous intent, have the determination to sacrifice everything, and seek the concentration of the national will. Those who have ulterior motives, advocate heresy, confuse the military's morale, and undermine unity must be abandoned by the entire country.</p>
<h3>Personnel Changes in the Japanese Army Strengthen the Backbone</h3>
<p>The Control Faction Gradually Enters an Era of Full Prosperity; Appointment of Chayama as Chief of the Military Affairs Section is Noteworthy</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The major changes in personnel in the Japanese Army, affecting the changes of commanders of the 7th Division and the promotion of 900 people, and the transfer of 1,800 officers, almost including all the cadres of the Army Ministry and the General Staff Headquarters, are highly valued by all circles in Tokyo. The current changes in personnel can enable the Japanese Army's control faction to enter an era of full prosperity. The control faction is led by Terauchi Hisaichi, Sugiyama Gen, Umezu Yoshijiro, Nakamura Kotaro, Isoya Rensuke, Ishihara, etc. Their opinions are intended to implement a gradual reform movement through legal means. The transfer of Itagaki Seishiro to the commander of the 5th Division, based on his personal experience, is a necessary step. At present, this move obviously contains the meaning of "keeping at a distance." Isoya Rensuke, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry, was transferred to the commander of the 10th Division. The position of Director of the Military Affairs Bureau he left behind is the most important organ for deciding the army's internal and external policies. It is now succeeded by Kogo Atsushi. Because Kogo is very familiar with the situation in China, Chayama Kenjiro was appointed as the chief of the Military Affairs Section of the bureau. The Military Affairs Section is the most basic organ for handling the army's policies, and Chayama's appointment to this position has attracted general attention. Chayama served as a military attaché in the embassy in Beiping in 1935. Later, because his understanding of China was different from that of the central figures of the army at the time, he was recalled to serve as the commander of the 18th Regiment stationed in Kurume. Chayama expressed considerable dissatisfaction with this transfer. Now that he is about to take office as the chief of the Military Affairs Section, it is expected that he will be able to realize his long-held aspirations in the future. From the perspective of China, the appointment of Tojo as the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army and Chayama as the Chief of the Military Affairs Section should be given equal importance. It is also noteworthy that Sakai, who played an important role in the so-called Hebei Incident in 1935, has been promoted to lieutenant general and transferred to the commander of the 28th Brigade. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] This periodic change of personnel in the army involves the promotion of 900 people and the transfer of 1,800 people, totaling 2,700 people. Both in terms of quantity and quality, it is a rare major change in recent times.</p>
<p>The first noteworthy point is the strengthening of the central department, especially the General Staff Headquarters. Nakajima Major General was appointed as the Director of the General Affairs Department, Ishihara Kanji Major General was appointed as the Director of the First Department, and Muto, Kawabe, and Nishihara, the three colonels, were appointed as section chiefs. Higuchi Colonel was attached to the General Staff Headquarters, consolidating the backbone. The General Staff Headquarters can be described as spectacular in recent times. It can be said that the quasi-wartime system of military orders has been established as a result. On the Army Ministry side, Kogo was appointed as the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, which is enough to compensate for the shortcomings of Isoya Major General. He was assisted by Tanaka (Military Affairs) and Chayama (Chief of the Military Affairs Section), and Kahan Major General was appointed as the Director of the Personnel Bureau, and Iida Major General was appointed as the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau. Kawamura Lieutenant Colonel was appointed as the senior section chief of the Military Affairs Section. Overall, the new lineup of the ministry can be said to have strengthened from the past.</p>
<p>Second, there are many points that indicate a new axis. Okabe Major General, who has never been involved in technical matters, was appointed as the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Technical Headquarters, and Aoki Colonel was appointed as the chief of the Mechanical Section of the ministry. From the perspective of past experience, they are very suitable. Also, Chayama Colonel has almost no experience in military administration, but his specialty is in Chinese relations. He was appointed to policy matters, intending to assist Director Kogo, who has no experience in Chinese relations. From the perspective of the importance of the China issue and the personality of Chayama Colonel, this is a very appropriate personnel change.</p>
<p>Third, the departure of Itagaki, the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and Sakanishi Ichiro and Muto Akira, the two colonels, from their positions as section chiefs can also be said to be a major change. Tojo Lieutenant General was appointed as Itagaki's successor, and great effort was made in other appointments. The lineup of the Kwantung Army is also very solid. Tojo Lieutenant General held many important positions in the central department, so he should be promoted to succeed Itagaki's important position. Although there has been discussion about Itagaki Lieutenant General's position as the commander of the 5th Division, his entry and exit from the central government can be said to be waiting for an opportunity. In short, the first personnel change of Land Minister Sugiyama can be said to be anti-Yun. (Twenty-fifth Allied Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Budget General Assembly Questioning Situation</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives' Budget General Assembly, originally scheduled to end the questioning on the 25th, still had 8 members from the Minseito party, 6 from the Seiyukai party, and 3 from smaller factions on the 24th, totaling 17 questioners. The board of directors convened a meeting last night and decided to change the agenda, extending the questioning by one day, and starting subcommittee meetings from the 27th. (25th, Dōmei News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives' Budget General Assembly on the 24th convened at 7:10 PM.</p>
<p>Minseito member Tajima Katsutarō (Minseito Party) questions:</p>
<p>What about turning the Japan Iron &amp; Steel Co. into a government-run enterprise? Also, what is the fundamental policy of the national iron and steel policy?</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce and Industry Godō answers:</p>
<p>Regarding the national iron and steel policy, we will implement concrete plans when necessary. To facilitate the import of steel materials, tariffs will be waived for two years, as the plan to increase iron and steel production can be completed within these two years. Rumors of Japan Iron &amp; Steel centrism are circulating, but in my opinion, there should be no monopolistic ideology of Japan Iron &amp; Steel. Nationalization of the iron and steel industry is difficult to achieve today.</p>
<p>Shinohara Yoshimasa (Seiyukai Party) asks:</p>
<p>Today, the relationship between local autonomous bodies and tribal clans is gradually weakening, and autonomous bodies tend to become incorporated. What are your views on the current state of such local systems?</p>
<p>Minister of Interior Kawarada answers:</p>
<p>The local system was adopted in the early Meiji era by Duke Yamagata, drawing from foreign models and implemented in accordance with Japan's circumstances. The results are generally commendable. If there are aspects of the tribal property system that should be improved, they will be improved.</p>
<p>Shinohara Yoshimasa asks what Prime Minister thinks of Finance Minister Yūki's fiscal policy, which heavily favors urban areas.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi answers:</p>
<p>Because we believed that reducing local allocation taxes would be beneficial in fiscal policy, we made revisions. We did not anticipate that rural villages would face problems like those of today.</p>
<p>Shinohara then stopped questioning, and the meeting adjourned at 9:10 PM. (25th, Dōmei News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget General Assembly on the 25th convened at 10:00 AM. Katsuma Masanori (Minseito), who had previously reserved questions, rose to criticize the basis for calculating the 70 million yen adjustment allocation for local finances. He pointed out that the government's claim that reducing the local burden from 220 million yen to 70 million yen was equivalent to a reduction of 30 million yen was inaccurate, as the actual reduction was 150 million yen compared to the previous proposal. He further criticized the unfair burden between municipal and county areas, stated many local petitions, and suggested that the government increase the amount at this time.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yūki answers:</p>
<p>Is this truly the voice of the rural villages? It is necessary for policymakers and you to give it sufficient consideration. The government intends to study it further. Can it wait until the next session of the Diet? If there is time, it can only be discussed by the government and the council.</p>
<p>Katsuma Masanori:</p>
<p>Can't the amount be increased because of the financial resources, or are there other reasons? The party's proposal is 65 million yen. Even if there are surplus financial resources, do you consider this amount to be sufficient?</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yūki answers:</p>
<p>There is no financial surplus today.</p>
<p>Katsuma Masanori:</p>
<p>What about relying on public bonds as a temporary measure, limited to one year?</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yūki answers:</p>
<p>Given the current state of the economy, it is doubtful whether even 3.5% government bonds can be absorbed. It is also uncertain whether the planned government bonds can be fully absorbed. Even in the 12th fiscal year, we must not issue them forcefully.</p>
<p>The Budget General Assembly reconvened at 2:30 PM. First, the committee chairman questioned the government:</p>
<p>During the General Assembly session, is there any hope of submitting a revised budget proposal?</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yūki answers:</p>
<p>The revised budget proposal has already been submitted to the Cabinet for deliberation and is scheduled to be submitted on the 26th. Next, Mr. Suematsu Kaichi of the Minseito party questioned the government regarding the abolition and merger of political parties and ministries, as well as the additional budget for the national policy integration agency, etc.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi answers:</p>
<p>The abolition and merger of ministries have not yet been concretely considered. Although a national policy integration agency is deemed necessary, the previous cabinet's plan is still under study, so the inclusion of an additional budget is still undecided.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yūki stated that regarding the budget revision, he wanted to fully discuss the military budget with the Diet and that it would still be expressed in the budget numbers as before.</p>
<p>Mr. Suematsu asks:</p>
<p>Is there any intention to reorganize the proliferation of economic organizations and social public organizations in rural villages?</p>
<p>Minister of Interior Kawarada answers:</p>
<p>Various local organizations should be reorganized and unified, but this must be fully studied by the Local System Investigation Committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Suematsu asks:</p>
<p>What are the Minister of Interior's views on the allocation of local subsidies?</p>
<p>Minister of Interior answers:</p>
<p>About 50 to 60 million yen will be used to reduce the number of households distributed, and another 10 to 20 million yen will be used to reduce the so-called "bad taxes" miscellaneous taxes.</p>
<p>At this point, Mr. Suematsu discussed aviation policy and advocated for the issuance of patriotic aviation bonds.</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Sugiyama answers:</p>
<p>We will strive to develop the aviation industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Matsuda Takeichi (Minseito) asks:</p>
<p>Up until now, Japanese diplomacy has been considered passive. If Japan is to be correctly recognized internationally, it must become dynamic diplomacy.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hayashi answers:</p>
<p>Although I am a layman in diplomacy, I dare to speak frankly when I should assert myself, believing that this is the essence of diplomacy.</p>
<p>Mr. Matsuda asks:</p>
<p>What is the current cabinet's diplomatic policy?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hayashi answers:</p>
<p>Not focusing solely on economic diplomacy, we believe it should proceed towards cultural and peaceful diplomacy, so we are currently working towards this.</p>
<p>Takahashi Kumajirō of the Minseito party stated that rural villages must be revitalized and questioned the government's views on rural policy.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yūki answers:</p>
<p>From a national defense perspective, the revitalization of rural villages is essential. We will strive for both material and spiritual aspects.</p>
<p>Mr. Takahashi asks:</p>
<p>Today's rural villages should aim to increase income, besides major agricultural products such as rice and cocoons. Therefore, it is appropriate to encourage the export and import of agricultural products. What is the government's view?</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yūki answers:</p>
<p>It is also necessary to not only focus on rice cultivation but to harmonize agriculture and secondary industries. Examples include woolen textiles, carpets, and tofu. We will do our best to encourage agricultural products related to import and export.</p>
<p>Mr. Takahashi discussed countermeasures to revitalize the Tohoku region and asked if the government intends to establish a Tohoku Agency.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister answered that the Tohoku budget contains a positive revitalization meaning, but the measures are not very good. The budget is not separated from the general budget, and there are no obstacles to revitalization.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi answers:</p>
<p>The establishment of the Tohoku Agency is still under study. It is not appropriate to respond regarding the revitalization expenses. The government also considers it insufficient and will make sufficient efforts in the future.</p>

<h3>Germany Stops Private Spot Transactions with Eastern Countries</h3>
<p>New Regulations Issued by German Foreign Exchange Control Director</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to new regulations issued by the Director of Foreign Exchange Control, private spot transactions between Germany and Eastern and Far Eastern countries, including the Philippines and China, will be prohibited. The reason is that spot transactions with Eastern countries such as Egypt, Sudan, India, Ceylon, Burma, Siam, the Straits Settlements, China, and the Philippines do not generate a surplus in the National Bank's foreign exchange account. Therefore, private spot transactions will soon be completely stopped. (Central News Agency, 25th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>New China View of Parisian Scholars</h3>
<p>Significant Progress in Construction, External Forces Hinder Revival</p>
<p>[Paris] Dr. Escarra, professor of law at the University of Paris, professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and legal advisor to the Chinese government, recently published a book entitled "China Past and Present." Referring to recent events in China, the book describes the country's political and social conditions clearly and in detail. It states that after the success of the Chinese Revolution in 1912, the imperial system was overthrown, and a parliamentary system was established. However, it was a rushed and superficial endeavor, so after an attempt, it failed. It was not until 1928, when the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition succeeded and the Kuomintang took power, that progress was made in all undertakings. "The National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and its stability is unmatched by previous governments after the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty." The warlord-led struggles for dominance have subsided, and civil wars are decreasing. The government is working hard to suppress the communists, which is the country's most important military action in recent years. At this time, the central authority is increasing, and unification has been achieved. Progress is being made in all undertakings, and construction work is being actively promoted. The results are obvious. Hard work is becoming a habit of the people, and striving for success is the general will. Everyone has the idea of ​​striving for excellence, and there is evidence everywhere. This is different from the past when people only knew how to be passive and do routine work. However, there are many difficulties in foreign affairs, which is a major obstacle to the country's self-reliance and innovation. In the past 100 years, some foreign countries have weakened China in order to achieve commercial goals or exercise their imperialism. This behavior has only benefited Japan. The weakening of China has ignited Japan's ambition. Japan's Greater East Asia policy is based on the annexation of China. Now that China is unified and its national strength is growing stronger, Japan will be driven out of the Asian continent, and its ambitious policy will be completely overthrown. This is why Japan is doing its best to oppose China's construction and revival efforts. "The crux of the matter at this time is whether China's evolution is purely free and proactive or will be driven by Japan." What is unknown is whether China's original power can assimilate that ambitious country that wants to control China temporarily. In the past, China has assimilated "barbarian tribes." Can it be assimilated again in the future? The current problem is a struggle between two cultures. Can China's inherent culture be transformed into a nation-state? This is what we want to know," and so on. (24th, Havas)</p>
<h3>British Undersecretary to Visit the United States</h3>
<p>[London] Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Sir Robert Vansittart will travel to the United States on March 17. He may discuss naval issues in Washington. (24th, Kokumin News Agency)</p>
<h3>Italy Denies Four-Power Defense Alliance</h3>
<p>German Foreign Minister Reports to Hitler, German Members of the Cultural Committee Go to Austria</p>
<p>[Rome] Foreign newspapers report that Italy's attitude towards German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Vienna is beyond friendly relations. Political circles here have solemnly denied reports of four-power pact negotiations between Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Italy, deeming them absurd. Italian political circles also deny that Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg will meet with Mussolini in Rome within a few days after his meeting with Neurath. Finally, rumors that Mussolini will visit Hungary are also considered unfounded. Italy is very satisfied with the results of Neurath's visit to Austria because the results are fully in line with the Rome Protocols. (24th, Kokumin News Agency)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Foreign Minister Neurath met with Hitler in Nuremberg today to report on his talks with key figures in the Austrian government. It is reported that four German members of the German-Austrian Cultural Committee will be von Wadsky of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Griesche of the Ministry of Education, and Weisenhofer and Menger. The German members are expected to arrive in Vienna on Thursday. (24th, Kokumin News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The Times published a message this morning stating that the purpose of German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Austria was actually to annex Czechoslovakia. The news has caused considerable unease among diplomatic circles. It is said that when German Chancellor Hitler delivered a speech in the House of Representatives on the 30th of last month, outlining the international situation, he did not mention Czechoslovakia at all. This can be compared with the news published in The Times. These people also said that the Czech government recently reached an agreement with the three German nationalist action parties in the country (namely the Christian Social Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Farmers' Party) to make concessions to the German minority. However, it is not yet known what attitude the Sudeten German Party, the opposition party in the Czech Republic, will take towards this agreement. If the party refuses to join, it can be proven that it is in league with the German Nazi Party. In short, the interests that Britain possesses extend to the whole of Europe and are not limited to Western Europe. This has been repeatedly stated by Foreign Minister Eden, and British cabinet members should reiterate it. This is for a certain country to be warned that the object of British policy is limited to Western Europe. (24th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Eden Returns to London to Meet with French Ambassador</h3>
<p>Discussing Diplomacy</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Minister Eden recently went to the French Riviera in southern France for a two-week break. He just returned to Beijing yesterday and resumed his duties. He immediately resumed contact with the British envoys from various countries. He recently received French Ambassador Corbin to discuss the European diplomatic situation, paying particular attention to the situation in Spain and Central Europe. When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Foreign Minister Eden also attended. Labour Party MP Davison raised questions about the work of the League of Nations Council. The Foreign Minister replied that between 1920 and 1930, the Council resolved a total of 24 international disputes. Since 1931, 10 cases have been resolved. (24th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Minister Eden returned to the House of Commons after his vacation today and was greatly welcomed by the public. The Foreign Minister answered questions twice, involving the Non-Intervention Committee's plan to ban volunteers from going to Spain. It is said that the International Committee agreed on February 16 to expand the non-intervention agreement to ban those who intend to serve in the Spanish army from entering Spain, and to ban the transport of arms and war materials to that country. The new ban came into effect on February 20, and he heard that the governments concerned had adopted the necessary plans. The details of the surveillance plan are still under discussion by the governments concerned and should be agreed upon in a few days. The Foreign Minister also said that the British and Portuguese governments had agreed to have 130 British personnel monitor the implementation of the non-intervention agreement on the Spanish-Portuguese border. This approach has been notified to the Non-Intervention Committee. The committee has approved in principle the special measures set by the British and Portuguese, but the details of implementation have not yet been submitted to the meeting.

<p>⊙ Dublin The Irish Free State Parliament today passed the bill prohibiting the continuous transport of volunteers and munitions to Spain by a vote of 77 to 50, effective from today. Before the bill was put to the final vote, the Parliament received a protest from General O'Duffy from Spain stating that the actions of the Free State government violated the beliefs of the Irish people and Christians. O'Duffy is currently leading Irish volunteers on the Madrid front, assisting General Franco, the leader of the National Army, in the war. (Central News Agency, 25th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] The House of Lords met this afternoon and held a debate on foreign policy. Lord Arnold, a member of the National Labor Party, spoke, advocating that British policy should be adapted to the actual international situation, which is that the League of Nations is weak and collective security is a mere formality. Lord Arnold then vehemently attacked the mutual assistance pacts concluded between France and Russia and between the Czech Republic and Russia, saying that "the result is that Germany is partially surrounded." Foreign Minister Eden should advise France to abolish the mutual assistance pacts between France and Russia and notify the Czech Republic that if a certain accident occurs because of the mutual assistance pacts between the Czech Republic and Russia, Britain will be unable to help the Czech Republic. Later, Lord Strabolgi, a member of the opposition Labour Party, spoke, expressing his opposition to the suggestions made by Lord Arnold, saying that in the years between 1925 and 1936, the Mediterranean region was fraught with danger. At that time, France provided Britain with a guarantee, willing to help Britain in the event of an incident. Britain benefited greatly from this, and it should not be forgotten. Speaking of the Czech Republic, he said that if the Czech Republic is invaded by another country without provocation, Britain has an obligation to provide assistance in accordance with the League of Nations covenant. He also believed that the British government should clearly express how it intends to act in response if a dispute occurs in Eastern Europe, so that a certain country will be warned and know what to be vigilant about. Speaking of Germany, he said that the scope of the mutual assistance pacts between France and Russia should be expanded to allow Germany to participate in them. This is what he hopes for. The conclusion is that the British government must pay close attention to the policies of the United States, more than ever before. Finally, Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth spoke on behalf of the government, explicitly rejecting the suggestions made by Lord Arnold, saying, "Our country has great interests and heavy responsibilities in Europe. The military equipment that our country has set up is necessary to maintain these interests and fulfill these responsibilities. As for its use, it will never be allowed to conflict with the League of Nations covenant. Therefore, if France and Belgium are invaded without provocation, we should, according to our obligations, use this military force to protect the safety of these countries," he said.

<h3>Abyssinian General Captured, Refuses to Surrender, Dies Calmly</h3>
<p>Italian Governor Reports Failed Negotiations, Related to Addis Ababa Bombing</p>
<p>[Rome] General Dejazmach Tesfaye, the commander-in-chief of the southern military and political affairs of Abyssinia and the son-in-law of the exiled emperor, hid in the Great Lakes region after being defeated by Italian Governor Graziani. He was captured by an Italian guerrilla team. Many others were captured at the same time. The Italian governor gave Tesfaye a week to surrender, but Tesfaye, as a general, preferred to die rather than surrender, so he was executed by firing squad today. Tesfaye was about 32 years old, of moderate stature, and had a beautiful appearance. In 1932, because of his meritorious service to the central government, the emperor specially awarded him the rank of general. The area he governed was the West Tamo Borana province near the Somaliland border, which was extremely wealthy. He owned the Addis Ababa water plant. One of his privileges was to collect municipal donations from Addis Ababa brothels, but Tesfaye exempted all but a small amount of damage collected from brothels selling alcohol. His troops numbered between 80,000 and 100,000. He originally planned to lead them to invade Italian Somaliland, or to spy on Mogadishu, or to advance to the border of British Somaliland to cut off the retreat route of Italian General Graziani's troops. Tesfaye was one of the most famous generals in Abyssinia, and he was a passionate patriot. He usually wore Abyssinian clothes. Before the split between Italy and Abyssinia, Belgium sent an army delegation to Abyssinia. When the war broke out, one of the country's officers and several Russian soldiers served in Tesfaye's army. Last month, four Italian troops, at least 20,000 in total, besieged Tesfaye in several routes. At that time, Tesfaye still had 10,000 troops, holding out in the area east of Lake Margherita. Everyone expected that if Tesfaye was captured, he would be executed by firing squad to end his life. (25th, Central News Agency, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Rome] Abyssinian son-in-law General Dejazmach Tesfaye was shot on the spot today after being captured by Italian troops near Lake Benna in the west. The circumstances were reported to Prime Minister Mussolini by Abyssinian Governor General Graziani as follows. It is said that after the arrest of General Imru, the leader of the government in Gojjam, western Abyssinia, I immediately sent a representative to negotiate with General Dejazmach Tesfaye to persuade him to surrender. But Dejazmach Tesfaye was perfunctory with the representatives, delaying the time, while concentrating his forces to make a bid. After receiving the report, I personally commanded the troops to advance to the Lake Chana area. Although I was besieged repeatedly, Dejazmach Tesfaye was still able to escape. Until recently, I ordered Lieutenant Dusi to lead a team of native soldiers to track him down before he was captured in front, and in order to eliminate future troubles, I ordered Lieutenant Dusi to execute him on the spot. After the arrest of General Imru, Dejazmach Tesfaye was the only Abyssinian general who continued to resist. According to the news received this morning, Dejazmach Tesfaye died from gunfire while commanding the battle. In fact, he was shot after being captured. It is heard that Dejazmach Tesfaye recently planned to capture the city of Addis Ababa. The assassination of General Graziani by natives a few days ago was related to this matter. It is also said that General Dejazmach Tesfaye, as the son-in-law of the Abyssinian emperor, was rumored to represent his father-in-law at the coronation ceremony of the British King in May.

<p>[Paris] After Italian Governor General Graziani was injured by an assassin in Addis Ababa a few days ago, Italian officials immediately arrested more than 2,000 suspects. According to news received by Le Petit Journal from the city, 1,400 of these people have been sentenced to death by summary procedure and executed by firing squad. (25th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Rome] After the Italian Governor General in Abyssinia was attacked by ten people and injured, foreign newspapers published news saying that of the 2,000 suspects arrested by Italian officials, 1,400 had been executed by summary procedure. The propaganda department issued a statement today denying this and saying that the news was absurd and obviously had other motives, because there were many important issues that needed to be dealt with at this time. Italian people were not paying attention to the issue of how to punish the native rebels in the colonies. (25th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Britain's International Payments Last Year</h3>
<p>Deficit Almost Nil - American Free Trade Policy - Praised by British Merchants</p>
<p>[London] According to a speech delivered today at the National Liberal Club by British Minister of Commerce, Mr. Runciman, Britain's international payments deficit for 1926 was almost nil. Mr. Runciman stated that the total amount of this deficit was calculated last night. Before including invisible exports, the deficit for the year was nearly 340 million pounds. The trade deficit seemed too large, but we need not be alarmed. We have the capacity to fully cover this amount. After including invisible exports, our deficit is actually only 19 million pounds, not 340 million pounds. This amount is truly insignificant. It is noted that Britain's trade had a surplus of 33 million pounds in the previous year, while last year's deficit was due to a large amount of visible imports, silver, gold, etc., amounting to approximately 347 million pounds, compared to 260 million pounds in 1935. On the other hand, last year's merchant shipping revenue increased by 20 million pounds to 95 million pounds, and overseas investment income increased by 15 million pounds to 195 million pounds. According to the instructions of the local news editor of The Times, the majority of Britain's trade deficit last year was due to increased import prices. (Central News Agency Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[London] Commerce Minister Runciman praised US Secretary of State Hull's policy of promoting world peace through the free exchange of goods in a speech at the National Liberal Club today. Mr. Runciman recounted his recent trip to the United States and also praised President Roosevelt's boldness, saying that the United States' free trade policy is a sure way to promote peace. Britain is also progressing towards this goal. If the economic policies of Britain and the United States can proceed in parallel without contradiction, the whole world can benefit together.

<h3>German Church Dispute</h3>
<p>Pastors Issue Five Demands - Conditions for Attending Religious Conference</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the recent disputes in the German Church, not long ago, German Minister of Religious Affairs Kerr issued a final warning to the pastors, threatening to suspend all anti-government pastors. However, the pastors were unmoved and directly presented to Head of State Hitler the sole condition for universal participation in the election of the Religious Conference. These conditions include: ㊀ Freedom of speech, ㊁ Freedom of assembly, ㊂ Unconditional release and reinstatement of all arrested pastors, ㊃ Future elections of the Religious Conference should be held in accordance with church practice, ㊄ Recognition of the church's right to not cooperate with the Nazi Party organization, "German Christians". The universal election of the Religious Conference was a decree personally issued by Hitler after the resignation of the National Religious Committee. The National Religious Committee was originally ordered to mediate the disputes between pure clergy and the so-called "German Christians," but resigned after failing to mediate. The task of the Religious Conference is to approve a new constitution for the German Church. (Central News Agency Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Wei Yisan Inspects Military and Political Affairs in England</h3>
<p>Will Also Go to Germany</p>
<p>[London] Wei Yisan, Councilor of the Military Council of Nanjing, has been in England for two weeks, thoroughly inspecting British military and political construction. He is now leaving for the front. The British War Office has drafted a very detailed inspection program for him, showing him various British military activities, including visits to the artillery school near Salisbury, the military intelligence school, the military science school in Woolwich, the staff school in Camberley, the army physical training school, and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

<h3>Chinese Tangerines Arrive in London</h3>
<p>[London] Two types of tangerines produced in China have appeared in the London market for the first time. Since the war in Spain began, the British Isles have not seen Spanish oranges, so a large fruit exchange in Shantou, China, has replaced them with Chinese tangerines. Despite traveling across the ocean, their taste is still incomparably fresh. A large batch of apples has also been shipped from Japan. The outcome is still being tested.

<h3>The Japanese 70th Diet's "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back"</h3>
<p>1.  The Diet Reopens After Many Twists and Turns</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: When the Japanese 70th Diet reopened on January 21, it did not continue due to an argument between Hamada Kunimatsu, a representative of the Seiyukai, and former Minister of the Army, Terauchi Juichi. As reported in the newspapers, such a conflict might have been easily resolved with a night's rest in normal times. However, the situation at that time not only did not allow for such a simple solution but also led to the resignation of the Hirota Cabinet, the abortive formation of the Ugaki Cabinet, and the emergence of the Hayashi Cabinet. During this period, the Diet was first ordered to suspend sessions for two days, then to adjourn for ten days, and then to suspend sessions twice more due to the new cabinet's revisions of various bills. In total, the interruption lasted 22 days, the longest in the history of the Japanese Diet. The Hirota Cabinet resigned during a Diet session, an unprecedented event except for the Katsura Cabinet in 1923, which collapsed due to the Movement for the Protection of the Constitution. Ugaki was ordered to form a cabinet, but it was aborted due to opposition from the military, a situation that had only occurred once before, during the era of Kiyoura Keigo in the Taisho period. Now, from January 23 to 29, two major events occurred within a week. The instability of the Japanese political situation is evident from this.</p>
<p>2.  The Prime Minister's Ten-Minute Speech</p>
<p>After "hibernating," the Diet finally reopened on February 15. That day, the sky was clear and without a cloud, creating an interesting contrast of light and darkness compared to the bleak and gloomy weather of January 21. Although we still went to observe, seeing the past week's avoidance of conflict between the political parties and the Hayashi Cabinet, we anticipated that there would not be any dramatic scenes.</p>
<p>The joint session of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives was originally scheduled to convene at 1:00 PM, but it was delayed until 2:00 PM because Hamada Kunimatsu temporarily requested that his defense against the military be added to the agenda. The various factions discussed the matter, fearing that this would cause unexpected disputes, and advised him to abandon it. The Diet's attitude of evading the military's sharp edge and seeking temporary peace was exposed at this time.</p>
<p>Hayashi Senjuro's policy speech as Prime Minister lasted only twelve minutes, and the foreign policy speech by the concurrently serving Foreign Minister lasted only six minutes, for a total of less than twenty minutes. There was much applause from the Liberal Democratic Party down below, in stark contrast to the shouting and jeering during Hirota's speech last time.</p>
<p>3.  Yuki Toyotaro Takes the Stage</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yuki then rose to speak. Although Yuki was one of the six cabinet members in the new cabinet with no experience in the Diet, his demeanor and attitude were much better than Baba's. His voice was very loud during the speech. A Japanese reporter satirically said, "Yuki's voice must have been borrowed from somewhere" because of his small stature and loud voice, which was quite meaningful. However, it is undeniable that Yuki is one of the most "popular" members of the Hayashi Cabinet. The characteristics of his entire speech were simplicity and directness. He did not express any views on the future of Japanese finance or his ambitions, but simply read through the budget outline and described a few facts about the revision of Baba's original plan. However, he boldly admitted that the current huge budget and tax increases were due to the unavoidable increase in national military spending. In particular, he frankly admitted in his later answers that he had no understanding of the prospects for Japanese finance. This attitude can at least be described as very sincere. Aside from someone in the audience shouting "What about the rural areas?" with a mocking laugh when he talked about stabilizing the people's livelihood, the general support was well-intentioned. In the end, even the Socialist People's Party applauded him as he left the podium.</p>
<p>4.  The Course of Questioning</p>
<p>After Yuki's speech, it was the turn of the Diet members to ask questions. The content of the individual questions has generally been reported in the newspapers. Here, we will provide a comprehensive report on several important areas of questioning and answers from the Diet—both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives—on that day. Among them, Sino-Japanese diplomacy is most relevant to us, so it will be described first:</p>
<p>㊀ Regarding Sino-Japanese Diplomacy: Not only did Hayashi himself state clearly in his foreign policy speech, "The governments and peoples of China and Japan should be closer to achieve the reality of Sino-Japanese cooperation and mutual assistance," but also this point was particularly noteworthy during the Diet's questioning. The first questioner in the House of Peers, Viscount Watanabe Chifuyu (Research Group), began by asking Hayashi, "What is the government's fundamental policy on Sino-Japanese diplomacy?" Hayashi replied, "As I said in my foreign policy speech, it is to try to clarify Sino-Japanese relations." Later, Baron Sakatani Yoshiro of the Koseikai further questioned Hayashi, "Our country's continental policy is often misunderstood as invading foreign territory. For example, the Chinese people believe that Japan has invaded Manchuria and intends to invade North China. I remember that in the past, during the Sun Yat-sen revolution, he sought help from our country. The Chinese people greatly hoped for our country's help. However, recently, an anti-Japanese movement has swept across China, and national unity has been achieved through anti-Japanese sentiment. This proves that the true meaning of Japan's 'continental policy' has not been understood by China." However, Hayashi's reply was nothing more than, "Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, the amity of Japan, 'Manchukuo,' and China is our country's unshakeable policy. I believe that this is a 'necessary' thing for the Far East. In the future, we must strive to make the national feelings of the three countries harmonious, promote economic cooperation, and strive to make China fully understand our country's true intentions."</p>
<p>Next, in the House of Representatives, Seiyukai representative Uehara Etsujiro raised the issue of the unification of diplomacy in his questioning on foreign policy. "Prime Minister Hayashi's statement on the establishment and unification of diplomatic policy deserves our full respect. There are many reasons for the complete collapse of the Hirota Cabinet's diplomacy, but the main ones are nothing more than secret diplomacy and bureaucratic self-righteousness. In order to establish diplomatic policy, does Prime Minister Hayashi have the determination to break the secret diplomacy? As far as the unification of diplomacy is concerned, diplomacy is the exclusive responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Does Prime Minister Hayashi have the awareness to sweep away the evils of the Hirota Cabinet at that time? Next, as far as the national policy of diplomacy is concerned, diplomacy is different from domestic affairs and does not change with changes in the cabinet. This seat believes that there are four important things in the implementation of the national policy of diplomacy: first, the establishment of a policy towards Manchuria; second, the adjustment of Japan-Soviet relations; third, the strengthening of good neighborly relations between China and Japan; fourth, anti-communist work in the Far East." Uehara then specifically raised five points regarding China policy for questioning, "In terms of strengthening good neighborly relations between China and Japan: first, our country should clearly announce to the world that our country is not a militaristic country and has no territorial ambitions; second, we should have a correct understanding of the current new nationalistic ideology and national movement surging throughout China; third, we should make the Chinese and Japanese people realize that they must truly become nations of coexistence and co-prosperity. Under this psychological state, we should launch diplomatic work between the two countries; fourth, the thoroughness of anti-communist work; fifth, Sino-Japanese cooperation should first be based on economic policy. What are Prime Minister Hayashi's views on the above points?" Hayashi's reply was quite simple. "The current diplomatic policy is aimed at ensuring that there are no regrets in all aspects. My intention is the same on the issue of 'Manchuria.' I feel the same way about relations with China and the Soviet Union" (At this time, there was loud laughter and shouts of "What is this?"). Uehara retook the stage and asked further, but he clearly had no intention of attacking. He only said, "The diplomatic policy has been heard. The question is how to implement it. I hope you will explain more clearly about the implementation plan for the unification of diplomacy." Hayashi used his usual evasive tactics. He did not directly answer the last point, but only said, "Regarding breaking the so-called secret diplomacy, preparations have been made. National diplomacy has not been forgotten."</p>
<p>From these questions and answers, we can clearly see that: ㊀ The root cause of the Chinese people's animosity towards Japan lies in Japan, which is their common understanding. ㊁ If this root cause is not removed, the impression of aggression against China cannot be eliminated. Without eliminating this impression, diplomacy between China and Japan cannot be launched, which is also what they do not hesitate to say. ㊂ The need for the unification of Japanese diplomacy is highly valued by the Diet, but Hayashi did not have the confidence to answer it. ㊃ Despite Hayashi's unsatisfactory answers, the Diet did not have the determination to pursue the matter. Both political parties in the House of Representatives feared dissolution and tried to avoid the possibility of conflict as much as possible. This was also very evident in the following two questions:</p>
<p>㊁ The Issue of Fascistization and the Failure of the Ugaki Cabinet: Regarding the issue of fascistization, the House of Representatives did not raise it this time. Only Viscount Watanabe of the House of Peers asked after questioning China policy, "What does the government believe about fascist authoritarian politics?" Hayashi replied, "Regarding the form of constitutional politics, we have not thought of importing foreign ideas as they are. We hope to implement politics in accordance with our country's unique constitution established by the emperor."</p>
<p>Koizumi Matajiro, a member of the House of Representatives from the Democratic Party, did not explicitly point out the issue of fascistization, but asked Hayashi, "Since everyone agrees that we should govern in accordance with the constitution, why did Prime Minister Hayashi specifically mention it and add the word 'unique'? Does it have a special meaning?" Hayashi replied, "I only hope to operate in accordance with the spirit of the constitution established by the emperor, which is based on our country's unparalleled national polity. I have no other intention." If further questioning were added here, there would of course be more doubts to ask. Not only was Hayashi's answer not clear, but it could even be said to have made the problem more complicated. However, aside from laughing and saying, "Why do we need you to explain this?", they did not go any further. They tacitly agreed that the use of the phrase "unique constitution" was valid.</p>
<p>Closely related to this issue is the fact that Hayashi insisted that party members not declare their party affiliation in order to join the cabinet when he formed his cabinet this time, which in effect denied the parties the qualification to participate in the government. Under the current situation where political parties still exist, and especially after political parties have not only participated in the cabinet but also organized cabinets for more than a decade, it is of course impossible not to forcefully attack this. However, regarding this point, only Koizumi lamented the political parties' "sacrifice of life, bankruptcy, sincerity, and contribution to the development of constitutionalism" in the early Meiji era, and briefly asked what reason Hayashi had for requiring people who wanted to join the cabinet to leave their parties. Aside from that, almost no one dared to ask further, and Hayashi's answer to this question was as simple as possible. "Because I don't think there was a need to invite political parties to join the cabinet under the circumstances at that time." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Overview of the Beijing Municipal Government's Work in the Past Two Years</h3>
<p>Report by Chen Jianru, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs</p>
<p>Beijing News: The Beijing Municipal Government held a memorial week for the Premier at 8:00 AM yesterday. All employees attended. Director Chen Jianru of the Bureau of Social Affairs chaired the meeting. After leading the ceremony, he delivered a report on the overview of the municipal government's work in the past two years and the issues that should be noted in promoting municipal administration in the future. He stated that since Mayor Ma took office, it has been almost two years. This time, the central government held the Third Plenary Session, and the Secretariat of the Municipal Government specially compiled an overview of the work in the past two years and submitted it to the conference for review. We will try to review the work in the past two years. The construction of all parties has made considerable progress in terms of both quality and quantity. However, it is still far from our ideal, and we still need to continue our efforts in the future. However, any construction takes funding as a prerequisite. Nanjing has barren land and poor people. The municipal fiscal revenue is less than that of other major cities. It is only enough to make ends meet. Even daily expenses are not enough. Not to mention bearing the huge construction costs of various projects. Therefore, the biggest problem in the future is how to increase municipal fiscal revenue. If this basic problem cannot be solved, then various construction plans will not be realized, and it will be difficult to expect the rapid progress of municipal administration. Mayor Ma believes that Nanjing is the capital, and various construction projects cannot be stopped. Therefore, the budget has been increased year after year. All I hope is that Nanjing can be built into a modern city in a short period of time. However, the general public does not understand the principles of municipal administration and believes that the municipal government's expansion of the budget violates the principle of measuring people's needs as an output. They do not know that to build a new city, this conservative concept should be broken. Therefore, although our budget has expanded year after year, the shortfall should be solved by other means. Or, following the precedent of various cities, issuing construction bonds or requesting the central government to increase subsidies to promote the construction of the capital. Nanjing is the capital of the country. The construction costs are borne by the people of Nanjing alone. Not only is it beyond the city's ability, but it is also unfair. As for the method of controlling finance, all money should be used in the most needed, economical, and effective places. The municipal government specially imitated the method of Qingdao City last year and established a Management Committee. The purpose is to obtain appropriate control, so as to obtain the maximum effect with the least amount of money. In addition, the organs related to finance, such as the Bureau of Finance, the Municipal Bank, the Municipal Treasury, the Management Committee, the Audit Department, and the Office stationed in the government, should obtain close contact to reduce the time spent on public documents and increase the efficiency of work. Finally, in terms of personnel, we should also try to adjust it. Under the leadership of the mayor, all parties should work together regardless of each other. At the same time, all employees should automatically work hard to promote municipal administration. The mother is waiting for the supervisors to reluctantly engage in each person's conscience and serve the country and society for the entire people of the city. Externally, we should make the people of the city understand the content of all the laws and regulations of the municipal government and the meaning of all the facilities, and implement them as a whole. Now we feel that we lack correct public opinion. Even if there is so-called social opinion, it is the private opinion of a few people, that is, there are other functions. Therefore, we sincerely hope that there will be correct public opinion for our reference and to improve our qualifications. Mayor Ma repeatedly instructed us to study and contribute opinions on the cloth administration at any time for selection. Therefore, I specially put forward the above-mentioned issues, hoping that colleagues will study and contribute more to the mayor in order to collect ideas and benefit from it."</p>

<p>Injured Thief Escapes from Hospital</p>
<p>Last month, the Songjiang Waterfront Provincial Police Team captured a bandit named Shen Langen in Shengziting, Punan. Because the bandit often tried to escape, the police fired a shot and wounded him. After being taken to the team and briefly interrogated, he was sent to the procuratorate for interrogation. He was sent to Songjiang Hospital for treatment due to his injuries. When the doctor's treatment was about to heal him, he suddenly escaped over the wall in the morning of the 24th, taking advantage of the guard's negligence. The hospital has sent letters to the army and military organs to search and arrest him.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Replacement of Two District Chiefs in the County Office</p>
<p>Zheng Zhenyong, the chief of the 11th district under the county, was previously arrested for harboring prostitutes in the countryside. The case is still pending in the county judiciary. Considering Zheng's lack of public trust, the county magistrate has ordered his replacement. The vacancy will be filled by Pan Zhengfen, the assistant of the 1st district. Additionally, Zhang Jie, the chief of the 7th district, has been approved to resign. The vacancy will be filled by Mu Lianshi, the assistant.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Strengthening the County's Defenses</p>
<p>Zhang Da, the police chief of the county, stated that the police district system has been established and will be perfected after the completion of the organization. In the 26th year, the police force will be reinforced to strengthen defenses. More than 30 police stations will be added, and 11 bunkers will be built.

The land price estimation for all rural areas in the county is scheduled to be completed by June.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Centuries-Old Candle and Charcoal Shop Ceases Operation</p>
<p>In the candle and charcoal industry in Yangzhou, Dasheng at Yuanmen Bridge and Ledemao at Dadongmen are the most famous, both with over a century of operation. Ledemao, which was about to close its doors, had Detai Candle and Charcoal Shop as a branch, renamed Detai Mao. Their businesses were flourishing, and they hired Ningbo workers to make candles. The candle flowers were famous for their self-flying. Unfortunately, Liang Ding, the manager of Ledemao, died suddenly last December 28th (February 9th). The news was kept secret, and his body was sent back to Zhouwei. Now, the business is declared bankrupt. It is said that the price of candle oil rose to more than 30 yuan per dan, making the cost too high and the turnover difficult. Accumulated debts of 8,000 yuan could not be paid, so the business was temporarily suspended. The current economic downturn is evident here.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Request to Abolish Advertising Tax</p>
<p>The Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce believes that the advertising tax is excessive and miscellaneous. Any commercial advertisement must first pay the tax. Although the cost is not too high, the process of paying the tax and getting a stamp involves many procedures and takes time. Even for domestic product advertisements that do not require tax payment, it is still necessary to ask the government to stamp a tax-exempt mark before they can be received and posted. Such complications hinder commercial promotion. Therefore, on the 24th, the chamber requested the provincial government to issue an order to abolish the advertising tax in the province to benefit commerce.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Ship Office Extorts Steamships</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Ship Office is harassing the people and causing resentment. It has been ordered to be abolished by the provincial chairman, Zhu Jiahua. However, Huang Xirong, the director of the Second District Ship Office, upon hearing the news of the abolition, secretly sent his staff to various ports to forcibly collect employment fees from the shipping lines, 10 yuan per barge and 100 yuan per steamship. A ferry of the Gongxing Shipping Company from Fengjing to Jiaxing was suddenly detained in an attempt to extort money. As of today, it has not been released.</p>

<h3>Chinese Youth Basketball Bank Group Championship Belongs to Domestic Products</h3>
<p>This year, the number of participants in the Chinese Youth Basketball League is exceptionally enthusiastic, so each group, except for the bank group, the other school and commercial groups are divided into sub-groups to simplify the process. Unfortunately, the strength of the participating teams is uneven due to the limitation of not participating in other leagues, but the spirit is excellent, and there have been no problems. Since the start of the competition, except for the women's group, which has not yet started, the bank group is about to end. The business group has also completed two-thirds of the schedule. The school group started later, and only competes on Saturdays, so it is still in the early stages, and the situation is difficult to predict. In the bank group, the strongest teams are Guohuo and Shanghai. Guohuo still has a match against Qianku, while Shanghai has completed its tasks. Guohuo has won four games and the championship is in its grasp. Shanghai unfortunately lost once and finished second. The rankings of other teams are also largely determined. Jiangxing is undoubtedly the fourth place. As for the business group, except for Business Group 2 and Business Group 3, the championship of the other Business Group 1 and Business Group 4 is difficult to predict. The current status of each group is listed below to get an overview. However, the school group is not included because the competition has not been underway for long.</p>

<h3>Industry and Commerce Soccer God Group Jindeg and Chang Geng Final</h3>
<p>Scheduled for Sunday Morning at 10 AM</p>
<p>Held at the City First Sports Field</p>
<p>After the Jindeg and Changgeng teams won the championships of the first and second divisions of the 8th Industry and Commerce Cup Soccer "God" group, they had a final on the 14th of this month. However, because the main player of the Jindeg team traveled south, they only fought with members of the second division team. As a result, the score was 0-0, with no winner. The game was extended for 20 minutes, but there was still no result. It was then scheduled to be replayed on the 21st of this month, but was blocked by rain. It was then postponed to 10 AM this Sunday (28th) at the Nanshi First Sports Field. Now, the main players of the Jindeg team, such as Xu Jingcheng and Xu Buyun, have returned north, and hopes are high.</p>
<h3>Huang Bochang Will Fight Vigovski</h3>

Before fighting Habenxin, Huang will fight the Russian Vigovski at the Paris Ballroom, No. 2 Bai Lainimomalang Road on the 2nd of next month. Vigovski weighs 210 pounds and is as strong as an ox. He is another strong enemy of Huang.</p>
<h3>English Billiards League</h3>

<p>Registration Deadline is Next Month 14th</p>
<p>The 5th small football competition organized by the Sports Committee of the Pudong YMCA has been scheduled to start registration from the 24th of this month, with a deadline of January 14th. This year, only adult groups will be accepted, limited to 30 teams. The most important aspect of the competition is discipline. Those who are arrogant and despise sportsmanship will be severely punished. It is hoped that the registered teams will carefully consider this to avoid future troubles. Furthermore, the association's planned 2nd Children's Games will also be held on March 14th. Prizes are currently being collected separately. This sports event has aroused strong interest in Pudong, and this year, a women's group has been added, making the competition more interesting than last year. The grand occasion can be predicted at that time.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow and the Day After Tomorrow's West League Schedule</h3>
<p>Referees Arranged for Each Field</p>
<p>The West League football group has reached the final critical moment. The French Commercial Team is at the top and is recognized as the most promising contender for the championship. However, the soul of the French Commercial Team, Xiao Huater, has not returned from Hong Kong, reducing the prospects of brightness. The outcome of tomorrow's battle against the Lau Ee El team will increase the risk. Even a single loss is not enough to affect the throne of the French Commercial Team. How can they know that they will not encounter misfortune again in the future? With the prosperity of the French Commercial Team this year, it is natural to maintain a constant victory. The honor of the inter-port competition is also the honor of the team. Unexpectedly, because of this, they lost the main player, causing the risk of losing the league championship. The changes in football are impermanent and intriguing.</p>
<p>French Commercial vs. Lau Ee El Group A Saturday at Yiyuan Botuo (Linesmen: Aqiaosheng, Naiaide)</p>

<h3>China Produces Educational Films to Participate in the World Education Conference</h3>
<p>According to the resolutions of the China Education Society and other educational academic organizations, the Ministry of Education was requested to produce two types of educational films to participate in the World Education Conference. (1) "Education in Our Country," which includes: 1. Educational Administration, 2. Primary Education, 3. Secondary Education, 4. Higher Education, 5. Social Education, etc. (2) "China's Educational Experiment Movement," which includes: 1. Rural Construction, 2. Mass Education, 3. Experimental Primary and Secondary Education, 4. Life Education, 5. Production Education, 6. New Teaching Methods (such as the Little Teacher System, etc.) and other various educational experiments, etc. These two educational films are both over 8,000 feet long. The former is about regular education, and the latter is about the movement of new education. It is reported that after the Ministry of Education approved the letter, it ordered various departments to separately compile materials, and the Educational Film Committee has started producing the films, aiming to complete them by the end of June this year. At the same time, publicity brochures will be prepared to be shown and promoted internationally at the opening of the World Education Conference on August 20th, so that all countries can understand the current status of Chinese education.</p>
<h3>Supervision Office of Students Studying in Japan Dissolves the Student Union</h3>
<p>Surrounding the Embassy to Make Demands and Force a Commitment</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) The number of Chinese students studying in Japan was close to 10,000 at the end of the year before last, exceeding the highest record in the past ten years. Later, due to various relations with the country, the number gradually decreased, and now it is only about 5,000 or 6,000. In addition to about 700 people scattered throughout Japan, the rest are concentrated in a corner of Tokyo. Most students are able to study hard, but there are also many young students who are indecisive and inevitably exploited. Their thinking tends to be radicalized and their actions go beyond the norm. In October of last year, the "Chinese Student Union in Japan" was established in Tokyo, being the largest of the 130 or so organizations organized by students in Tokyo. At the beginning of the establishment of the association, it was still able to seek benefits for the majority of students without study certificates, repeatedly appealing to the supervision office to cancel the qualification restrictions, and uniformly give graduates who returned home graduation certificates, so that the qualifications of several years of schooling would not be denied by the government. This kind of appeal was quite supported by the majority of students. Following this, the association's future was full of hope. Unfortunately, on February 14, when another so-called "Chinese Student Association in Japan" held its establishment meeting at the Japan-China Association in Kanda District, the students of the Union believed that they were illegal organizations destroying the unified front of the study abroad community. People were sent in advance to occupy the meeting place, so that it could not be held. The two sides faced off and clashed, and a bloody tragedy occurred. Fortunately, there were not many injuries, and the injuries were not serious. On the same day, the crowd was dispersed by the Japanese police. Then, the Union gathered two or three hundred people again and went to the embassy to petition, surrounding Ambassador Xu and Supervisor Chen, putting forward various demands and forcing a commitment. The next day, many newspapers in Tokyo recorded it, such as the Asahi Shimbun, which was headlined "Xi'an Incident? The Chinese Embassy is Surrounded," and attached photos. The Hochi Shimbun was headlined "The Ugly Behavior of Chinese Students," etc., which seemed to be related to the reputation of the country and the dignity of the students. Students who cherished their reputation and loved their country were very disapproving. The embassy's supervision office has also based on reports from various sources that the Student Union is inevitably colored behind the scenes. Supervisor Chen resolutely ordered its dissolution on the 16th, and did not allow the association to continue its activities. Some students believed that the supervision office's resolute measures were too close to high pressure and spoke up for the Student Union. It has been heard that there are demands to dissolve the student association, but some students believe that the association's actions and remarks have unstable evidence. If they are not dissolved early, they may be deeply rooted and difficult to clean up in the future. However, whether the Student Union will completely accept the supervision office's order and stop activities is a question. If there is really a background, the future direction is worthy of attention. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Chen Guofu is a Standing Committee Member of the Chinese Cooperative Society</h3>

<h3>The Problem of Literacy Education for Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Guild Letter to the Mutual Aid Association</p>
<p>3,000 Yuan Monthly for Independent Organization</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Guild of the Special District, regarding the issue of literacy education for rickshaw pullers, this morning sent a letter to the directors of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, requesting an expansion of the budget. The original letter is transcribed below: Respected Sirs, We have recently received Instruction No. 3610 from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, which states: "Upon investigation, the one-year plan for literacy education for rickshaw pullers in this city has been submitted to and approved by the Municipal Government with Instruction No. 22592. In addition to complying with the eighth provision of the plan, we have sent a letter to the Bureau of Finance, stipulating that all public rickshaws applying for licenses must submit a receipt from the Shanghai Bank as proof of payment before the license can be issued. This order must be followed. Furthermore, the original plan was intended to be implemented from February, but this is no longer feasible and should be changed to March 1 of this year. This order must also be followed." It is to be noted that rickshaw puller literacy education was originally one of the welfare undertakings of your association. The expenses for the rickshaw puller welfare undertakings undertaken by your association, which our members bear, are already collected by the Public Works Department with the license fee, amounting to a huge sum of one yuan and five jiao per vehicle per month. Adding tax on top of the fee, and with the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs instructing that the expenses for rickshaw puller literacy education be three jiao per vehicle, rickshaw operators will inevitably go bankrupt and be unable to operate. Now, in order to comply with the order, promote rickshaw puller literacy welfare, and maintain the business of rickshaw operators, we respectfully request that your association, starting from March 1, expand the education and welfare budget to 3,000 yuan per month and separately hire experts to independently organize a Rickshaw Puller Literacy Education Committee in cooperation with the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to jointly handle literacy welfare matters for rickshaw pullers throughout the city. This matter concerns government orders, the promotion of rickshaw puller literacy welfare, and the maintenance of rickshaw operator businesses. We respectfully hope for your approval and reply.</p>

<h3>Overview of Shanghai Experimental Primary School (3)</h3>
<p>Special Report by This Newspaper, Investigation by Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>3. Administrative Facilities</p>
<p>(1) Administrative Organization: The administrative organization of the school is based on the "Organizational Regulations for Experimental Primary Schools" promulgated by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, with some modifications. The principal is fully responsible for all school affairs. Under the principal, there are the General Affairs Department, the Teaching Department, the Research Department, and special committees, which are responsible for handling various matters under their jurisdiction. Each department is further divided into several sections to assist in handling departmental affairs. In addition, there are three divisions, namely the First, Second, and Third Divisions, which are subordinate to the General Affairs, Teaching, and Research Departments, respectively, to handle the teaching and experimental research matters of each division. Each division is further divided into several groups to assist in handling divisional affairs. Major matters in the school are decided by the school affairs meeting; during the period when the school affairs meeting is suspended, its powers are exercised by the administrative committee.</p>
<p>(2) Grade System: The First Division of the school has one class each for kindergarten, first grade, second grade, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade, and sixth grade; the Third Division has one class each for single grade, first and second grade combined, third and fourth grade combined, and two classes each for fifth grade and sixth grade, totaling fourteen classes. These fourteen classes are the ordinary grade system, and they all start in the autumn. As for experimental subjects, students are grouped separately according to their intelligence and academic ability. The Second Division has six extension classes, with one class each for second grade, third grade, fourth grade, and fifth grade, and two classes for sixth grade. All subjects are the same as those in ordinary schools. The establishment of extension classes is to show the meaning of assisting in the implementation of compulsory education. In the autumn of the 25th year, the school had a total of 1,008 students, including 723 boys and 285 girls.</p>
<p>(3) Revenue and Expenditure: The school receives an annual recurrent expenditure of 23,560 yuan from the provincial treasury to operate fourteen classes, including 1,500 yuan for operating expenses, which is stipulated to be used for experimental research and promotion. School fees are waived according to the orders of the department. Miscellaneous fees and material fees generate an annual income of approximately 1,200 yuan, which is used to purchase children's library books, labor materials, and sports supplies. The six extension classes in the Second Division do not receive provincial funding and use the approximately 2,500 yuan received from book fees, miscellaneous fees, and material fees to offset salaries, office expenses, and other expenses. The total construction cost of the new school building in Wujia Lane is approximately 47,000 yuan. In addition to the 5,500 yuan of temporary funding allocated by the provincial treasury, the remaining amount was completed by the economic assistance obtained by the school's faculty and staff through the implementation of the new Five-Year Construction Plan (to be introduced later).

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Outflow of Yarn from Warehouses Leads to Reaction in the Yarn Market</p>
<p>Mainly Due to Large Price Difference Between Futures and Spot</p>
<p>Active Spot Sales Trigger Short Covering</p>
<p>Nearly Reaching the 40 Yuan Level This Month</p>
<p>Rumor of Shorts Covering at a Premium This Month</p>
<p>The yarn market, which had fallen for three consecutive days, turned upward yesterday. This was because the price of the March futures yarn was 10 yuan higher than the spot price. Currently, the factory has limited yarn in stock, and all spot goods are mostly concentrated in yarn and cloth warehouses. Indian merchants are reportedly buying a large amount of spot yarn and trying to sell it in the market. It is said that the longs are willing to pay the shorts a premium of 5.6 yuan based on the March futures yarn price to take back the goods. As a result, market sentiment turned bullish. At the same time, spot sales were active, with more than 2,000 bales of yarn sold from the warehouses. In the afternoon, market prices continued to rise.</p>
<p>Futures Yarn Rises by 2.8 Yuan</p>
<p>Futures yarn opened higher across all months in the morning. The sharp decline in the past three days triggered short covering by those who had profited. At the same time, 1,000 bales of yarn were sold, and 870 bales were sold from the warehouses. As a result, market sentiment improved slightly compared to the previous day. However, most people still had a bearish outlook and sold on rallies, as inventory levels are expected to gradually increase. Yarn mills are operating at full capacity, and production has increased significantly compared to before. However, prices have already fallen sharply, and there may be some room for a rebound of a few yuan. The futures yarn price nearly reached the 40 yuan level again this month. As a result, the closing prices for all months were 1.3-1.9 jiao higher than the closing prices of the previous day. Market conditions remained stable after the afternoon opening. Due to good news, the longs were trying to sell the chips they had bought. Spot sales were good, with buyers purchasing more than 3,300 bales of spot yarn, including 2,020 bales from the warehouses. Also, with the settlement to be held tomorrow, retail investors were eager to roll over to avoid risks. Market prices advanced slowly. As a result, the closing prices for all months were another 8-9 jiao to 1 yuan higher than the morning closing prices. According to investigations, Dafu sold 6,200 bales, Hengyi 1,350 bales, Dafeng 3,500 bales, Gengfeng 2,700 bales, Yongchang 950 bales, Yukang 950 bales, Mingde 1,350 bales, Changji 1,250 bales, Taichang 3,250 bales, and Changfeng 2,600 bales. Hengchang bought 1,100 bales, Yuanyi 900 bales, Jifeng 2,750 bales, Hexing 2,800 bales, Changyu 1,350 bales, Yutai 4,150 bales, Wang Taixing 1,550 bales, and Runkang 3,650 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Reach 3,300 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales have improved. Merchants from Tianjin, Sichuan, Yunnan, and other inland areas have suddenly become active. More than 2,000 bales of yarn in warehouses have been bought up, leading to a rise in the futures market. According to statistics, a total of 3,347 bales of spot yarn, including warehouse yarn, were purchased by various merchants throughout the day. The selling price was similar to that of the previous day. The amount of purchases by various merchants is listed below.</p>
<p>Yarn Market Recovers, Cotton Covers Shorts and Rises</p>
<p>At the Same Time, American Cotton Also Continues to Rise</p>
<p>However, Local Inventories are Still Ample</p>
<p>Industry Sentiment Remains Bearish</p>
<p>The cotton market has strengthened due to the continued rise in American cotton and the recovery of the yarn market, which has stabilized market sentiment. Short covering activity has caused the market to trend higher. However, industry sentiment remains bearish. At the same time, demand for spot cotton from factories is weak, and local inventories are still ample.</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Rises by 2-3 Jiao</p>
<p>Futures cotton opened higher across all months in the morning due to the continued rise in American cotton. Market momentum was stable. However, Indian cotton was mediocre, and local inventories were high. Therefore, most people had a bearish outlook. However, the sharp decline in the past two days triggered short covering and strengthening. As a result, the closing prices for all months were 2.5 jiao higher than the closing prices of the previous day. Market conditions became tighter after the afternoon opening. The rise in the yarn market boosted the cotton market. However, spot cotton transactions were not active, and industry pressure to sell short was heavy. As a result, the near-month contract rose another 1.5 jiao compared to the morning closing price, while the far-month contract remained unchanged. According to investigations, Yuda sold 9,800 dan, Shenda 2,500 dan, Dachangcheng 1,000 dan, Changhe 1,700 dan, Hengyi 2,300 dan, Dafeng 1,700 dan, Yicheng 3,300 dan, Taichang 2,300 dan, Fukang 1,300 dan, and Xinchang 2,500 dan. Dafu bought 3,000 dan, Jifeng 3,100 dan, Hexing 1,700 dan, Yuanda 1,300 dan, Gengfeng 2,100 dan, Changyu 2,300 dan, Fengtai 3,700 dan, Renfeng 1,300 dan, and Runkang 9,700 dan. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Still Shows No Improvement</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is mediocre, factory demand is weak, and sources have not been found.</p>
<p>American Cotton Merchants Buy March Contracts</p>
<p>American cotton opened yesterday with good news from Liverpool. Liverpool merchants bought, and prices rose by 2-5 British pounds across all months. Industry brokers saw only three delivery notices issued and believed that the spot cotton situation was firm, so they bought March contracts. Regarding the situation of foreign currency systems, market sentiment was mixed, and there was a lack of large-scale short-selling in the market, which was worth paying attention to. Private estimates of pledged cotton sales reached approximately 620,000 bales. After that, market conditions became more active, and new cotton spot merchants sold. Closing was stable, with spot prices rising by 10 British pounds and futures prices rising by 2-12 British pounds. English cotton spot prices rose by 3 points, and futures prices rose by 3-4 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by European exporters, but then weakened due to the stock market downturn. Finally, due to purchases by the public, short covering, and good news from Liverpool, the market rose again, with Pingguoer rising by 0.25 rupees, Aomula rising by 0.25-0.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rising by 0.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (24th telegram).</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 25th was Bailuoxi at 223.5 rupees, Aomula at 206.5 rupees, and Pingguoer at 181 rupees, all rising by 1.25 rupees.</p>
<p>Osaka Spot Yarn Plunges by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>Sanhin Cotton Yarn Sees an Increase</p>
<p>Osaka, 25th Telegram: Spot yarn fell by 4-10 yuan. 16-count fan-shaped yarn was 229 yuan, and 20-count goldfish yarn was 249 yuan, both down 4 yuan. 40-count five-star yarn was 380 yuan, down 10 yuan. 42-count pheasant yarn was 370 yuan, down 5 yuan.

Futures cotton rose by 0.35-0.55 yuan, with the near-month contract at 74.4 yuan and the far-month contract at 75.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Have Shifted According to Supply and Demand</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, April futures began trading. Initially, market sentiment was quite good, with Jinzi merchants showing considerable interest. Later, Company No. 35 sold on behalf of a certain bank, with a steady stream of selling. It was rumored that there were still large batches of spot goods of types A and B being settled, which caused market sentiment to turn downward. Finally, No. 5 entered and then exited, greatly discouraging market sentiment. Market conditions rose first and then fell, with a difference of more than one yuan in a single day. There was no other news in the environment. The situation on the floor was completely dull and declining. Because it was a matter of supply and demand of chips, the downward trend in the future is probably not over yet. Because there were many longs during the previous two months of rolling, there were originally many longs in March. Market changes are probably still wanting to come out. Yesterday's events: At the morning opening, No. 5 bought in, reportedly representing Jinzi merchants. However, No. 35, representing the financial sector, continued to sell, and No. 50 also sold a lot. The market price initially rose very sharply. This month's type C rose sharply by 0.5 jiao. After that, types A and B still showed no improvement, and the trend changed sharply. Thieving only gave type E a good 0.1 jiao, and the rest gradually turned weak, returning a small 0.1 to 0.3 jiao. After the afternoon opening, Nos. 3, 34, 35, and 77 all sold, and No. 11 also sold a lot. The situation was already sluggish, and spot goods seemed to be selling, so the market price unanimously continued to decrease by a small 0.1 to 0.35 jiao. At the closing, Nos. 32, 35, and 58 continued to sell, and No. 5 even turned to selling. The situation felt completely sluggish, decreasing by another 0.2 to 0.65 jiao. As a result, the March contracts all decreased by a uniform 0.25 to 0.65 jiao, except for the newly opened April contracts, which are not counted. The total transaction volume was 8.94 million yuan. The results of its increase and decrease are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>

<p>The afternoon opening was 1,155.5 yuan. Qiafeng, Yongqian, Chang, and Xiang sold to 5.4 yuan. Fuxing Yong took advantage of the low prices to take delivery. The closing remained at 1,155.5 yuan. There was a fluctuation of only 0.2 jiao throughout the day. As a result, it closed up 0.2 jiao from the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price, due to the Central Bank's list price for the standard gold price rising to 1,156.4 yuan, was approximately less than 1 yuan based on the closing price. The spot market situation was stable. The selling price of raw gold was 15.5 yuan, and the buying price was 12 yuan. Tianjin goods were quoted at an additional 14 yuan, but there were no transactions. Regarding swaps, because shorts needed to pay a premium of 0.2 jiao yesterday, all parties were still watching and lacked counterparty transactions.</p>
<p>There was limited trading within the exchange. In summary, Dacheng, Fu, Minyong, Dadecheng, and Yuanmaoyong bought in slightly. Dadecheng, Qingfayong, Qiafengyong, Shengyuanyong, and Qianchangxiang sold slightly. There were 1,925 March forwards left, with a total of six long parties and twelve short parties. There were 3,927 April chips, with a total of twenty-six long parties and thirteen short parties. The total number of transactions was 147 forwards in the morning and 91 forwards in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Banks and Mobil Settled Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Although Chinese and Foreign Firms Were Selling</p>
<p>The US Exchange Rate Remained Slightly Tight</p>
<p>Although speculators sold in the foreign exchange market yesterday, banks and Mobil both bought, causing the market to soften. In the early morning, overseas telegrams reported that London swaps were down 0.0625 for the near term and unchanged for the far term. New York silver prices remained flat. The far-term silver price in Montreux was unchanged or up 0.03 yuan. London raw gold rose by one penny. The UK/US exchange rate fell by 0.107. The UK/France and UK/Japan exchange rates remained flat. The US/UK exchange rate fell by 0.03125. The US/France exchange rate fell by 0.1875. The US/Japan exchange rate fell by 0.02. The Central Bank announced its list prices, which were flat for both the UK and the US. The customs gold unit rose by 0.02 yuan. At the opening of the foreign exchange market in the morning, the UK, the US, and Japan were all similar to the previous close. After opening, HSBC's list prices for the UK and the US remained flat, and the silver balance tax was down 0.025, which was extremely stable. This was mainly due to interbank trading, with Chinese merchants selling the UK and buying Japan, but both were maintained by banks. Later, although Sassoon sold shillings, banks bought on the cheap, and the overall trend remained stable. However, the near-term slightly showed signs of weakness. But Mobil settled US dollars, slightly flattening the market at noon. In the afternoon, Xinfeng and Sassoon continued to sell shillings, and banks absorbed a lot. Near-term US dollars were also bought in. The closing was still tight, with the closing selling prices for the near-term British exchange rate at 1 shilling 2.5625 and 59175 pence, and US dollars at 29.6875 yuan, which was flat for the UK and down 0.03125 for the US compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants sold approximately 100,000 yuan in near-term US dollars. The recorded transactions for today are listed below:</p>
<p>British Exchange Rate: The morning opening selling price for the near-term was 1 shilling 2.5625 pence. Shanghai sold to Zhejiang Overseas Chinese for March at 5.625 pence. Youli took delivery for the same month at the same price. Sassoon sold to Xinfeng for April at 5.3125 pence. Sassoon sold spot goods to Youli at 5.9375 pence.

Youli took delivery for March at 5.625 pence. Datong bought February at 5.9375 pence, all sold by Sassoon. The closing selling price was 1 shilling 2.5625 and 59375 pence for spot goods, 5.625 pence for February, and then tightening by 0.03125. Transactions totaled approximately 100,000 pounds.</p>

The closing selling price was 29.6875 yuan for spot goods, 65625 yuan for February, 625 yuan for March, and 5625 yuan for April, with buying prices increasing by 0.0625. Transactions totaled approximately 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The East Exchange Rate was sold by Korea and Mitsui for February at 103.8125 yuan (Zhengjin bought, January rate 4 yuan, Korea sold in the afternoon) for February at 103.8125 yuan. Transactions totaled approximately 300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Heavyweight coarse cloth is the most sought after</p>
<p>March and April futures have already sold out</p>
<p>Other fabrics do not sell well</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was affected by the continuous sharp drop in yarn and flower prices. Customers were watching and waiting, and unanimously slowed down their operations. The market was weak and prices gradually declined. The morning market continued the previous day's decline, and prices were reported to have fallen again. Eastern-made white goods and fine cloth had the largest sales volume, and the changes were also faster than other goods. The morning market price fell by 5 to 10 cents. Qingdao goods remained firm due to the lack of loosening in the producing area. Local fine cloth and fine twill also fell by 2.5 to 5 cents. Eastern goods, the "Four Gentlemen" serge, once fell to 25.5 cents per yard. Local Zhigong, serge, and crepe also fell by about 5 li. However, after the entry of standard yarn, the market rebounded and sentiment improved. Eastern fine cloth quickly covered short positions, and prices gradually rebounded. As a result, Eastern fine cloth and fine twill fluctuated very little compared to the previous day's market. Colored "Four Gentlemen" serge also rebounded by about 2.5 li. Local colored goods also stabilized. Transactions in all directions were light. Only the local street and the Qingdao and Tianjin gangs purchased more than 500 pieces of Eastern fine cloth and fine twill, which was a relatively large amount. The military uniform gangs successively absorbed nearly 10,000 pieces of heavyweight coarse cloth. The March and April goods of various factories have recently sold out, so the heavyweight coarse cloth market is the most firm and popular.</p>
<p>Western-style woolen cloth sells very well</p>
<p>Sichuan and Hunan gangs are already preparing for summer goods</p>
<p>Western-style fancy woolen cloth sold briskly in the market yesterday. Local customer gangs have wide outlets. Durable呢, 火姆四本條格, spring light fancy呢, 啥味羅四呢, 板絲呢, five-color呢, etc. have been purchased in large quantities by local and foreign tailors. Medium-thick serge and Hanlimeng also sell well. Customers from Beijing, Hangzhou, Tianjin, and Hankou have successively arrived in Shanghai to purchase goods. Chongqing, Chengdu, and Changsha gangs stationed in Shanghai are also preparing goods together. Furthermore, due to the long distance and the time required for transportation, there is also demand for summer goods. The trend of both domestic and foreign goods is good, and standard market prices are mostly firm. The arrival and sales of Japanese goods are more than last year.</p>
<p>Yuanfang Auction House holds a red盘 auction</p>
<p>—Market prices are falling, not rising—</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 3,026th auction of Yuanfang 洋行, which was for spring red盘 goods. Five types of goods were displayed: Western satin, 元絨, Zhigong呢, 羽綢, and foreign red cloth, totaling 37 brands and 57 boxes. The prices of the five brands of Western satin auctioned were all lower than the previous period. Zhigong呢 was average. 元絨 Nine brands fell by 3 cents per yard. 羽綢 Twenty-seven brands were auctioned, and the prices of the goods fell instead of rising. Zhulin brand fell by $2.30, 彩八士, 燕國公, 鸞鳳花燭, 惟妙賞中秋, and 蝶仙九連燈 eight brands each fell by $1, and the rest fell by a small number of cents. Only the Donghua brand was average. Foreign red cloth was a heavyweight type that had not been listed for a long time, and the industry competed to purchase it, so the price was strong. The next auction will include Longfei brand 元府綢, 惟妙 White 洋紗, and 十八子 White bleached cloth.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous grain transactions are particularly sluggish on the Lantern Festival</p>
<p>Foreign firm sesame seeds also appear depressed</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Lantern Festival, and the local exchange and the Dalian Exchange were closed for one day, causing the spot market to also see a sharp decline in transactions. The total market volume was 2,400 bags of soybeans, 50 bags of sesame seeds, 100 bags of green beans, 200 bags of broad beans, 50 bags of red beans, and 500 bags of red sorghum. Due to the weak overseas market, foreign firm sesame seeds also appeared depressed in Shanghai. It was heard yesterday that a telegram offer of $14.40 was made, but there was still no response from overseas, so the prospects may trend downward.</p>
<p>Thick粳 supply exceeds demand</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 vendors arrived from various gangs. Of these, more than 10 vendors were 薄稻. Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Xi'an, and other gangs only handled more than 1,000 packages of 包子, so the market situation was only stable. The supply of thick粳 exceeds demand, and it is weak by 5 cents. 杜尖 is average. 洋尖 is slightly soft. 陰兀 No significant difference.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, one or two vendors arrived from various roads along the river. Due to the Lantern Festival, there were few goods listed on the market, and the market's capacity was weaker than the previous market. The price of white 粳 of upper-middle quality was weak by several cents to nearly 10 cents. Lower quality was average. Early rice also showed a weak trend. 薄稻 was clearly priced but weak by 3 to 5 cents. 羊杜埠客尖 was average. 白元 was stable. The prices of other goods showed a weak trend.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Foreign firms did not sell any silk all day</p>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets, except for Lyon which remained stable, saw a consistent decline in silk prices in both Japan and the United States. The New York Exchange's standard silk fell by 2.5 cents for the near term and 3 cents for the deferred term. Japanese silk 83 degrees and 75 degrees, as well as Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk's holding prices, each fell by 3 cents. Yokohama spot prices fell by 5 yuan, and futures fell by 7 yuan. As a result, the Shanghai export silk market felt even more quiet, and no sales were seen all day. The Indian silk market was the same. Silk users were still only engaging in sporadic local transactions. Foreign customer gangs can be expected to trade a little in the future, as the Lantern Festival has passed and the local silk market will return to its normal state.</p>
<h3>The Silk Industry Last Year and the Understanding We Should Have Going Forward (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xiaohe</p>
<p>Statistics on the Import, Inventory, and Consumption of Raw Silk in the UK and the US in the 25th Year (Units are bags, based on data published by the "Silk Association of America")</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>In the first half of the 25th year, the silk market in January and February was able to maintain a relatively firm market, thanks to the remaining momentum of the silk price surge at the end of the previous year. However, thereafter, the silk market gradually declined due to the expansion of silk stocks in New York and the decline in raw silk consumption. By the end of June, the average silk price in various countries had almost fallen to the lowest selling price of the year. At that time, before the cocoon harvest, Japanese silk was deliberately sold cheaply to suppress cocoon prices, and at the same time, news of a large amount of Italian silk being devalued and shipped to the United States for sale was gradually revealed, which made the silk market even weaker. The market situation was largely a feeling of oversupply. In terms of prices, New York spot prices fell from $1.8874 to $1.5463, Yokohama spot prices fell from 851.93 yuan to 684.34 yuan, Lyon Shanghai silk fell from 73.02 francs to 62.60 francs, London Hua silk fell from 7 shillings 11 pence to 6 shillings 2 pence, Shanghai silk market high-grade white factories fell from 955 yuan to 745 yuan, A-grade white factories fell from 915 yuan to 715 yuan, and B-grade fell from 845 yuan to 680 yuan. Other types of silk such as 雙宫輯里土絲 saw a slight increase due to the lack of Shanghai handmade goods. The above table can give a general idea of the state of the British and American silk industries before June. Looking at the statistics on raw silk exports from China and Japan over the past year, we can see that the silk industry last year matched the trend of the world economy, which first declined and then prospered. Starting in January in the first half of the year, the export volume of silk from both countries fell, taking the same path as market prices, and there was little sign of a turnaround. Before June, Japanese raw silk exports fell from 38,505 piculs in January to 26,416 piculs, the lowest picul amount of the year. The export quantity of Shanghai raw silk fell from 2,702 piculs in January to 1,237 piculs in February, and was only 1,619 piculs by the end of May, a decrease of 2,966 piculs compared to the average monthly export volume of the previous year.</p>
<p>Statistics on Raw Silk Exports from China and Japan in the 25th Year (Unit: Picul)</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>After June, the Chinese and foreign silk industries, in addition to the changing of old and new raw silk itself, the world's raw silk consumption gradually increased at that time, and market prices therefore rose. Also, there was still little new silk being produced, and the stock of silk gradually felt insufficient, and the silk market was clearly divided from before June. Moreover, at the beginning of July, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry announced that the year's Japanese silk production had been greatly reduced, and the expected cocoon collection amount was 39,498,990 관, a decrease of 16% compared with the previous year, second only to the lowest production amount of 39,477,160 관 in the 13th year of Taisho, a record of unprecedented poor harvest. As a result, the price of fresh Japanese cocoons rose to over 5.8 yuan, resulting in the anecdote that the reduced cocoon harvest actually increased the cocoon value by more than 40 million yuan. As a result, Yokohama silk prices surged, and after July, silk prices had broken through the 700 yuan mark, exceeding the 800 yuan mark again by the end of October, and had risen to 910 yuan by the end of December, the highest price of the year. In the Americas, after June, silk stocks in New York gradually decreased, and by the end of August, only 29,825 bags remained, which was less than the usual monthly need in the United States. Therefore, general speculators and textile merchants absorbed spot silk at high prices, and the number was huge, and the market chips became even more scarce. Moreover, due to the influence of Yokohama price increases, people's hearts became even more excited. Until the end of the US election, after Roosevelt returned to the White House, the American industry and commerce suddenly saw revitalization, and the monthly raw silk consumption quantity also exceeded the 40,000 bag level, and did not decline until the end of the year. At the same time, silk prices also maintained a record of over 2 US dollars per pound. In Europe, due to the sudden devaluation of the franc, prices rose one after another, and the silk market also rose rapidly. In early October, Lyon Hua silk A grade rose from 72 francs to 90.50 francs, B grade rose from 66 francs to 84 francs, and Japanese silk rose from 66 francs to 86 francs. After October, due to the successive price increases of Japanese and American silk, Hua silk A grade rose again to 98.50 francs, B grade rose to 95.50 francs, and Japanese silk rose to 103.50 francs, a total average increase of one-third. The overseas silk market in the second half of the year was as described above. Looking at the domestic situation again, since the Shanghai Incident in the 21st year, the entire silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has collapsed, and the rural economy in the sericulture area has also fallen into bankruptcy. At that time, the central government issued public bonds for relief, and in terms of fundamental solutions, it implemented a control policy. Over the past five years, it has progressed from the intertwined interests of officials and merchants to the present, and there are gradually signs of clarity and success. In terms of silkworm eggs, in the 25th year, 1.23 million sheets were issued in Zhejiang, 1.3 million sheets in Jiangsu, 40,000 sheets each in Sichuan, Shandong, and Anhui, 5,000 sheets in Shanxi, and 1,000 sheets in Hubei, for a total of 2.656 million sheets. Compared with the initial amount of only 50,000 sheets issued, the progress can be described as rapid. In terms of silk reeling, in the second half of the year, in view of the turning point in foreign silk sales, high silk prices, and promising business prospects, silk factories and car numbers increased sharply. By August, there were 48 silk factories operating in Shanghai, with 11,118 cars, 37 in Wuxi, with 11,802 cars, and 24 in Zhejiang, with 994 cars, for a total of 109 factories, with 28,914 cars, the most prosperous period of the year. In terms of silk prices, from June to November, high-grade white factory silk rose to an average price level of over 850 yuan, to 865 yuan. White factory silk A grade was 847.50 yuan, B grade was 825 yuan. For other silk products, after the failure of the Japanese-Indian business association, Indian merchants turned to purchase Hua silk in large numbers, so the sales of 輯里 and 雙宫 silk were very active. 七里 silk rose from 530 yuan to 700 yuan, and 雙宫 silk rose from 365 yuan to 440 yuan, all of which were high price records for the year. Shanghai raw silk exports gradually increased after May, reaching 7,297 bags in December, the highest number in a year. (To be continued)</p>

<p>申報 Literature Supplement</p>
<h3>Farewell</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"Farewell!"</p>
<p>The person he likes leans against the cabin space he occupies, gently waving his hand, his eyes seemingly guarding his sleeves; why won't she look at him? He is adding a few more wrinkles to the corners of his eyes because he is reluctant to leave this time. Isn't he also the person she likes?</p>
<p>Since they like each other, why are they reluctantly separating? Aren't they still maintaining good feelings?</p>
<p>They came to this strange place only a month ago. They rented a room next to a quiet street, the window close to the lawn, with small trees, vegetable plots, and in the tall courtyard walls in the grass, there were two flags of Hitler and Mussolini, often fluttering there; nearby, almost all were the residences of noble people. From this, one can also know how luxurious their room is and how lucky their life is. And they prepared bags of flour and rice at the corner of the wall; so they were happy, busy exploring the new scenery of this place, sometimes, they didn't return until late at night.</p>
<p>Soon, she went to a singing group to learn to sing, and he stayed at home alone to read, or to visit old friends. So, in a few days all his friends knew he was back, and they also knew he had brought a newly acquainted girl. For some reason, friends came to see that girl; every time a friend came, they ate with them, sometimes, after they had eaten, he would specially buy food from outside for his friends, or he would make it himself again. After the friends left, she would often ask him:</p>
<p>"What does that friend do"?</p>
<p>His answer was always these few sentences:</p>
<p>"Writes manuscripts".</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>"Writer".</p>
<p>After hearing his words, she often said to herself:</p>
<p>"Writer, writer"!</p>
<p>In her pure heart, she only knew to praise the noble term of "writer".</p>
<p>After half a month, almost all the friends he knew had come. If there were one or two friends who happened to come when she was not at home; when he told her, she would ask:</p>
<p>"Is he also a writer"?</p>
<p>"Yes, yes"!</p>
<p>Once, she suddenly asked him:</p>
<p>"Why are they all hungry"?</p>
<p>He remained silent and did not answer her. She thought he hadn't heard, so she said again:</p>
<p>"Are they all hungry"?</p>
<p>"Yes, yes"!</p>
<p>She was a little strange, because she grew up in a rich family, and she rarely knew the lives of people outside her circle. This time, by chance, she followed her feelings, stole some money from home and escaped with him, so she asked again:</p>
<p>"Then why are they all hungry"?</p>
<p>He still didn't answer her; at the same time, she saw his expression and didn't ask him anything more.</p>
<p>From then on, when she saw his friends, she would first ask:</p>
<p>"Are you hungry"?</p>
<p>Gradually, she seemed to have become a habit:</p>
<p>"Are you hungry"?</p>
<p>This had already been asked of him, and at the same time, she should also ask herself the same question.</p>
<p>"Then why are we all hungry"?</p>
<p>She didn't answer him either, as if she already understood all the reasons for the hungry.</p>
<p>In the end, they had to separate in hunger. He sent her to the sea liner heading to her hometown.</p>
<p>They shook hands and left. He was on the shore, she was on the boat, a strip of sea between the shore and the boat separated them, each saying:</p>
<p>"Farewell!"</p>
<p>However, neither of them said on what year and day they would meet again.</p>
<h3>Childhood Innocence</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Since my wife was hospitalized for childbirth, the responsibility of taking care of the children at home has been entirely on my shoulders. The child, who is only two years old, is used to being with his mother all day long, so naturally he can't help but miss her when she suddenly disappears. Originally, I was determined to sacrifice my daily work and devote all my time to taking care of the child, but sometimes I still can't take good care of him. As he plays, he calls out for his mother, and when he looks at his mother's photo, he shouts loudly, "Want Mom!" A child's affection for his mother is truly indescribable. Later, when he couldn't wait for his mother to come back, he cried out repeatedly, "Mom is gone." As a result, this difficult-to-relieve sorrow forced my heart to burn with anxiety, and I felt overwhelmed in coping with it. Because of his longing for his mother, this child simply ignores his father's coaxing, and keeps shouting, "Don't want Dad, don't want Dad!" No matter how I tell him all his favorite stories and food, trying to win his favor, it's impossible, until he finishes this bout of crying.</p>
<p>But during the day, it's still better. When a few friends come over, with more people around, he can forget about his longing for his mother. Winter days are short, so after hanging out for a while, the day passes. When it gets dark, the problems start. The house is cold and quiet. Not only does the child easily think of his mother, but I, as a father, also involuntarily think back to the previous scenes in the house and the mother in the hospital room because of this unusually deserted new environment. Usually, the child sleeps close to his mother on a large bed. Now that there's one person missing on the bed, it's impossible to escape the child's true memory and recollection. His "Want Mom" slogan becomes more and more energetic, and also more and more miserable, exhausting me, the person who is playing the role of both father and mother, and making me helpless.</p>
<p>Therefore, I'm thinking: The sorrow of orphans, I'm afraid only orphans can truly understand.</p>
<p>With some difficulty, after using some wisdom, I managed to coax the child to sleep. Looking at the time, it's already 9:30, a full hour and a half later than the usual time he goes to bed. Who should be responsible for this little bit of guilt? The child doesn't sleep soundly. After a while, he opens his eyes and looks around. After a moment, he shouts "Mom" a few times in his sleep, and after a while, he cries out involuntarily. I can't relieve the child of his longing for his mother, so I am very anxious myself.</p>
<p>When I go to bed, I feel an infinite sense of fatigue on my body. My mind is dizzy, and my whole body feels like I've done a day of heavy labor. All my joints are a little sore. After taking a deep breath, I can't help but think to myself: Being a mother, this job is very difficult, and very tiring. For me, who is doing the job of a mother for the first time, due to unfamiliarity in many aspects, it's natural to involuntarily express such feelings.</p>
<p>In the night, when I wake up, the child is awake. He is looking for his mother, crying non-stop. First, he stretches out his hand and gropes around, not finding the person he is waiting for, then he opens his eyes and looks around randomly, and then cries out: "Mom, Mom won't come, don't want Dad." He pushes me away, and tears flow out drop by drop. It's no use giving him toys to play with or saying nice things to him. He just keeps crying and shouting until he cries himself tired, and then he goes back to sleep with his eyes half-closed.</p>
<p>How anxious I am! My wife has to stay in the hospital for ten days before she can be discharged. If the child keeps crying like this every day for ten days, what will I do? I am worried. So, I think of families without a housewife and children without a mother. The shortcomings in between cannot be compensated for in a short time, and the chaos in between is also quite alarming.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after two days, the child has completely adapted to this new environment and life. He plays with me, eats and drinks with me, and sleeps with me. He occasionally talks about his mother, but he doesn't cry or shout, and it passes in a moment. This puts my mind at ease. But there's one thing. Although the child's situation of looking for his mother has eased on the surface, it's very obvious that he hasn't forgotten his mother in his heart. He often thinks silently for half a day without saying a word, and often still seems to be deliberately stating, "Don't say Mom," "Don't want Mom," but the smile from his face has disappeared. There must be his reasons in between.</p>
<p>When friends come, they all say in unison that the child has lost weight, and praise the child's cleverness. If he cried and shouted for Mom every day, the adults wouldn't be able to do anything about it. I can't tell if the child has lost weight, because I see him every day, without a comparison. But if he has really lost some weight, it must be related to his praised cleverness. He is lost in longing. This, inevitably gives me, the father who thought he had fulfilled his motherly responsibilities well, a big blow in my heart. The child has not forgotten his mother. The child is actually thinking about his mother even more than he did in the past few days. The reason he doesn't say it out loud is that it shows that he also knows how to suppress his unhappy feelings in his little heart.</p>
<p>What method can I use to cure the child of this disease? Or should I let it be and let it develop naturally? If I really put myself in the child's shoes and think about it, then I should be sad for the child. Precisely because the child doesn't say it out loud, it makes me, the father, even more sad. I have asked some friends for advice, asking them if they have any clever ways to make the child return to his former joy; I have also asked doctors who specialize in treating diseases, asking them what good medicine can be used to cure the child's inner depression, but they all cannot give me a satisfactory answer. This can't help but add another layer of sadness to the child. Since everyone has no solution, then I can only let it be.</p>
<p>Here, I feel how close the need of a mother is to a child. The love that a father gives to a child is how unwelcome it is to the child. On the contrary, the maternal love can get the child's most sincere support.</p>
<p>During this period, I also have to set aside some time every day to go to the hospital to see the child's mother, that soft and weak mother like cotton candy. Every time I sit next to the hospital bed, the wife's first words are always to ask if the child is good at home, and then she asks if he is eating a lot, and if he misses Mom so much. That kind of caring and unforgettable appearance is exactly displaying the maternal concern and love for her children. I tell her everything truthfully, but I don't say that the child has lost weight. Every time she finishes listening, she always asks back with a suspicious expression, "Is it true? Is the child so easy to handle?" Based on her usual experience with the child, she doesn't believe that the child would be so obedient and wouldn't pursue his mother's disappearance, because in the past, the child couldn't leave his mother for a moment. The wife can't help but believe my words. I have never lied to her before, and later she even felt happy for the child because of this, and she couldn't help but say, "If the child can really be like this, it will be much easier after he comes home in the future, and he won't always缠着me. This child, I didn't expect him to be so obedient, so lovely."</p>
<p>This continued until the ninth day. I took the child to the hospital to pick up the child's mother. Sitting in the car, I repeatedly told the child where we were going and what we were going to do. After listening, the child didn't show the joy that I had expected. Instead, he was stunned for a while, as if he was thinking about something. After a while, he slowly said: "Pick up Mom, Mom is coming." He said it indifferently, making me a little suspicious. When the mother sat in the car, she hurriedly hugged the child, and the first thing she said was: "The child has lost weight." Yes, I know he has lost weight, but at this time the child tightly hugs his mother and kisses her mouth. I stare blankly at the other small life being held in my arms.</p>

<h3>Description of Trivial Matters</h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>It seems there was a time when someone criticized the description of trivial matters in daily life. The main idea was: living in such a great era, if a writer only dwells on their own petty affairs, humming and sighing, overcome with emotion, and describing them tediously, then they must have become detached from the times, and the social value of their work will be equal to zero. … Describing trivial matters is undoubtedly a negation of political literature.</p>
<p>What is the phenomenon reflected in Chinese literary works due to the negation of describing trivial matters? In my opinion, it seems to have delved even deeper into the style of describing trivial matters.</p>
<p>This may sound a bit strange. But the reason for this pursuit is inevitable. Initially—perhaps still now—opposing the description of trivial matters was, as already mentioned, due to its content and form being individualistic. Furthermore, in order to emphasize that an author must grasp the great era, they had to start by opposing the description of trivial matters. However, the grasp of the era is by no means solely based on worldview; it requires deeper practice. It is not enough to simply immerse oneself in the great era; even more so, the great era must be dissolved in one's heart. Only by expressing this era through oneself can one truly say they have "grasped it!" Generally speaking, the description of trivial matters is a naturalistic method of description. The selection of its themes and subjects is not due to a chemical reaction between the author's subjectivity and social objectivity, but rather the subjective mixed with some trivial objective facts, or simply due to the objective that cannot be grasped, stimulating a kind of backlash in the subjective, naturally expressed. In this regard, the work can indeed express some subjective "sincerity." Especially when such works touch on the love of humanity, they can deeply move the reader's heart. Lévi-Strauss's noble motherhood and Xu Jingsong's memorial writings about Lu Xun should be descriptions of trivial matters in their nature! However, every time I read them, tears streamed down my face. And what moved people to tears were always those sentences that the author may have been writing with tears in their eyes.</p>
<p>A work that makes people cry may not necessarily be a good work. However, it undoubtedly possesses the necessary condition to become a literary work—the contagion of emotion. In this regard, sincerity—perhaps that is the advantage of describing trivial matters. But the disadvantages of describing trivial matters are also numerous: triviality, emotionalization, distortion of grasping reality, or fragmentation of reality. Moreover, the consistent spirit always cannot escape from sentimentality, showing personal powerlessness, and at the same time, also eliminating human ambition and fighting spirit. The impression given to the reader—is emptiness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, within the group of authors who oppose the description of trivial matters, the techniques they themselves adopt still follow the naturalistic style of describing trivial matters. Of course, to avoid the trivial style of description, they mostly adopt the third-person perspective. They strive to avoid the author's appearance or speaking. But the materials they use to shape the protagonist of the work are also extremely trivial, cowardly, and even formulaic. This is due to the author's narrow personal experience, or because the author has no experience at all and relies solely on hearsay, or even because the author has read a few theoretical books, using A to represent the theoretical system of capitalists and B to represent the theoretical system of laborers—a creative method of building empty frameworks like that. Then, no matter how hard the author tries to write it out in the third person, the protagonist has already become an accumulation of trivial matters. The protagonist becomes a pile of building blocks, not a living person with a soul.</p>
<p>In this way, the result of opposing the description of trivial matters over the years has instead emphasized the disadvantages of the description of trivial matters—triviality. And forgotten the advantage of describing trivial matters—sincerity.</p>
<p>I naturally do not want to hide my own mistakes. For the past four or five years, if I have also written, I have tried my best to avoid my own pain and sentimentality when writing. Because of the unparalleled trauma that life has given me, I have also wanted to write something to express my feelings, but I always feel that what this would give people would be a poison, so I restrained myself and wrote something else that was somewhat distant from my own life. Looking back now, this has become my fatal flaw in my writing. Of course, to transmit one's own trauma to others may be sinful in a certain sense. For such a declining nation, is it still permissible to vibrate its nerves with sentimentality? However, my work has always been wrong. Here, I should certainly restrain my sentimentality. But I should even more calmly analyze this life's wound objectively, investigate the social causes, and unfold a social scene behind a fallen wounded soldier. At this time, the author and the analyzed self maintain a considerable distance, giving a description; and the analyzed self—an objective existence—deeply and urgently passes through the author's thoughts and emotions. Perhaps this analyzed self—an objective existence—is the enemy of the author's essential thoughts and emotions, but even if one strikes oneself in this way, extinguishing the enemy; however, the author has achieved the highest achievement in creation in striving to display the true picture.</p>
<p>According to my thinking, Lu Xun's "In the Tavern" and "The Misanthrope" were perhaps written under such circumstances. Especially "The Misanthrope," every time I read it, every sentence, even every word, gives me great pressure. Wei Lianshu's desolation seems to be my own desolation as well. Anatole France said that every work should be the author's confession; I believe this should be explained in such a context.</p>
<p>Naturally, the realistic creative method should be as Eugène Delacroix said in his letter to Marguerite Hackenal: "Apart from Delal's correctness, it is the transmission of typical characters in typical situations." And to achieve this, the author needs to deeply understand life even more. What the writer needs is not a bit of a worldview fabricated out of thin air, but a "worldliness" with a correct understanding. Some people call Lu Xun an "old worldly man." Before deeply studying Marx and Engels' theories, Lu Xun had such brilliant creations. On the one hand, it was because he had progressive historical views, and on the other hand, it was because he understood "worldliness." Understanding "worldliness" is not a bad thing, understanding "worldliness" and correcting it with progressive historical views. This made Lu Xun a realist writer rarely seen in the world.</p>
<p>But in the Chinese creative circles, which generally flow into the empty, hypocritical, trivial, vulgar, and formulaic now, I hope to return to "sincerity." That sincere attitude of describing trivial matters is still worth learning, I believe.</p>

<h3>Shou Moqing Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Talked About Promoting the Sale of National Products in Guangdong Province</p>
<p>Shou Moqing, Manager of the Guangzhou China National Products Company, was sent to Shanghai to contact business circles to prepare for the opening of a national products exhibition. He arrived at the port on the Japanese Empress yesterday afternoon. After meeting with Wang Xingyao, Director of the China National Products Production and Sales Association, he decided to visit various manufacturers within days to discuss the matter. According to Shou, Guangzhou is a major commercial port in the country with a population of about 1.3 million and a large consumption power. However, due to the backward local industry, the obstruction of transportation with neighboring provinces, and the lack of unified currency, foreign goods are rampant and a great deal of wealth is lost. Last year, the provincial government was reorganized, the currency system stabilized, and the sales of national products to Guangzhou gradually increased. However, due to the high exchange rate, the sales market is still not smooth. Recently, the Guangzhou branch of the National Economic Construction Association has joined forces with various local agencies and organizations to establish the Guangdong National Products Movement Promotion Association to promote and develop the national products industry. However, due to the small number of local manufacturers, he came to Shanghai to contact various factories, invite them to join the association, and prepare for the opening of an exhibition to facilitate sales. Shou continued that Guangdong's industry currently only has two items, rubber products and knitwear, which are of good quality and can meet local needs. The province-run sugar and cement are also successful, with sugar already being exported and cement only being used locally. Other industries are difficult to develop due to a lack of raw materials or equipment. Domestic manufacturers can go to Guangzhou to promote sales and will make a great profit and recover many rights and interests.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese from Three Countries Arrived in Shanghai by Ship the Day Before Yesterday</h3>

The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau immediately sent them back to their hometowns. The bureau also announced yesterday that the French postal ship Félix Roussel arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying Yu Shan, a Chinese laborer from Shandong who participated in the European War.

<h3>French Ambassador to Japan Henri and His Wife Went to Japan</h3>

<h3>Shi Xianru, Reporter of the American National Daily, Returned to China for Investigation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, He Announced the Current Situation of Overseas Chinese in the United States; The Issue of American-Born Chinese Students is Serious</p>
<p>Shi Xianru, Propaganda Director of the Kuomintang's US General Branch and reporter of the American National Daily, returned to China from the United States yesterday morning and arrived in Shanghai. Mr. Shi has been in the United States for seven years and has paid close attention to the situation of Chinese expatriates in the United States. He has also served in our consulate general in San Francisco. After returning to China, he will go to various places to investigate. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency went to interview him and was informed of the recent situation of Chinese expatriates in the United States, which is recorded in detail as follows.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of Party Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs in the Americas</p>
<p>According to Mr. Shi, ① Regarding our country's party affairs in the Americas, due to the frequent national disasters in recent years, attention has been paid to saving the country and propaganda work. Therefore, most party members have a tendency to abandon the doctrine and talk about policies. Three or four years ago, Kuomintang party members often had factional disputes with each other. The situation has been better in the past year, but there seems to be a lack of talent. ② Regarding overseas Chinese affairs, the situation of overseas Chinese in the Americas is extremely complex, with deep-rooted concepts of faction, region, and clan. Therefore, there is often a tendency to fight. In the past three or four years, due to the seriousness of national affairs, most people have gradually shifted from a narrow spirit of infighting to the struggle for the country and the nation. As for Chinese expatriates in the United States, most of them run restaurants, followed by laundry and antiques. There are also many who do hard labor. However, due to the American economic panic, the number of unemployed Chinese expatriates is increasing and business is also declining sharply. The current US government's "Unemployment Relief Administration" employs many unemployed expatriates, so most people do not have to worry about freezing or starving. Chinese expatriates have a strong tendency to make money, which is deeply ingrained and difficult to change. As for San Francisco, there are about 10,000 Chinese expatriates, most of whom are engaged in business and can live a decent life.</p>
<p>Employment Issues for Overseas Chinese Youth</p>
<p>Mr. Shi also said that the future employment issues of American-born Chinese youth in the United States are worthy of attention by the motherland government. Most overseas Chinese children have specialized skills, but the shops run by our overseas Chinese are old-fashioned and most of them cannot employ these specialized talents. Although American-run businesses value these native-born specialized talents, they are unwilling to employ them due to union relations, which leads to unemployment problems. There are many native-born Chinese who have studied advanced skills such as chemistry, civil engineering, and electrical engineering, but they cannot find work in the United States. The difficulties are: ① Although they are equal to Americans in law, there is still discrimination in fact. ② American industrialists are willing to employ Chinese workers because they are paid lower wages, talented, specialized, and diligent, but the unions strongly oppose it. ③ Although no Chinese youth does not shout that they want to return to the motherland, they are extremely alienated from their motherland, cannot speak Chinese, and cannot adapt to their daily life and habits. Therefore, the problem is both serious and complex.</p>
<p>Glimpses of American Educational Characteristics</p>
<p>Mr. Shi has carefully investigated the American education system in the United States and has collected more than 1,000 photos of vocational education, which he has made into slides and will contribute to the motherland. He briefly stated his impressions of the American education system, saying that there are many differences between the United States and our country that are worthy of attention: ① The United States focuses on children, not seeking to make children satisfy the school, but seeking to make the school suitable for children, focusing on their individual development. ② Recently, more attention has been paid to vocational guidance. Every school must have counselors to help students choose courses and find jobs in the future. ③ Schools are socialized. The skills and academics of graduates are not separated from the actual society at all. ④ The spirit of democracy is fully embodied. No matter what kind of academics, they are studied in school at the same time and cooperation is promoted at all times to cultivate students' group life. Shi is scheduled to go to Beijing this morning and then go to North China for investigation.</p>
<h3>Xiong Tonghe, a Specialist in Group Art at Central University, Went to the United States Yesterday</h3>
<p>Investigating Fruit Industry</p>
<p>Xiong Tonghe, a specialist in group art at the College of Agriculture of Central University, has long been studying pomology. In view of the decline of our country's fruit industry in recent years, he went to various fruit-producing areas and markets in the United States to conduct on-the-spot investigations, paying particular attention to packaging, grading, preservation, transportation, and sales methods. He went to the United States on the Japanese Empress yesterday (the 25th).</p>

<h3>Leather Shoe King Bata Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>It is said that 5 million pairs of leather shoes are sold annually in China.</p>
<p>The purpose of this trip is to expand the Eastern market.</p>
<p>Chinese-made shoe materials will be used as much as possible.</p>
<p>World shoe king Bata, on this world tour to inspect branches around the world and investigate market conditions, initially departed from the Czech Republic on his private plane, passed through India and Annam, and arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago. He then took the Changxing Company's Empress of Japan liner, arriving in Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday. He was accompanied by ten secretaries and attendants, and stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. The Czech Republic's Minister to China, Mr. Fejer, hosted a banquet at his official residence on Jiaozhou Road at 8:30 last night to welcome Mr. Bata. According to Mr. Bata, who told a New Sound News Agency reporter that the purpose of his trip was to inspect the business of branches around the world and investigate the leather shoe market situation. China is a very promising market. In addition to Shanghai, Bata branches have also been established in major commercial ports such as Nanjing and Hankou. According to statistics, the leather shoes supplied and sold by the head office average about five million pairs per year. Business is more developed in European countries, and more than that, because Europeans need to wear an average of four pairs of leather shoes per year. Sales in the United States are also more developed. Now I am planning to promote the markets in Eastern countries, and because China is not short of shoe-making raw materials, I plan to purchase and use them in China as much as possible. People often only know how to export and do not advocate importing. I don't think so, because it is like the human body, only knows how to excrete but does not know how to eat, life will not be guaranteed, and the same is true for trade. There must be imports and exports to achieve balance. I will not stay in Shanghai for long. I am scheduled to take the Dollar Steamship Company's President Hoover liner to the United States via Japan on the 27th. My plane will also be shipped from Hong Kong on the Hoover liner.</p>

<h3>China-Japan Trade Association Held Board Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to convene a general meeting of members</p>
<p>And welcome Japanese economic envoys</p>
<p>The China-Japan Trade Association held a board meeting yesterday and decided to convene the first general meeting of members and prepare to welcome Japanese economic envoys. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Scheduled General Meeting of Members: The China-Japan Trade Association held a board meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday on the third floor of the Jin Cheng Bank, the association's headquarters. The attendees included Chairman Zhou Zuomin, Chinese directors Yu Qiaqing, Rong Zongjing, Song Hanzhang, Liu Hongsheng, Li Fusun, Xu Xinliu, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Tang Shoumin, Wu Yunzhai, Lin Kanghou, Japanese directors Yoshida Seiji, Yamamoto Takeo, Bu Bu Takuji, and Funatsu Tatsuichiro. Chairman Zhou presided over the meeting. It was resolved that in accordance with Article 11 of the Articles of Association, a general meeting of members should be held once a year after consultation between the Chinese and Japanese boards of directors. The first general meeting of members is scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM on March 18 at the Shanghai Pudong Fellow Association Building. The meeting adjourned at about 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Preparing to Welcome Japanese Envoys: The Japanese government has appointed Kodama Kenji, chairman of the Japan-China Trade Association, as an economic envoy to visit China, and many members of the association will come to China to investigate in a private capacity. They will arrive in Shanghai in mid-April and will first visit Beijing to meet with our country's authorities. After staying for about two days, they will return to Shanghai and stay for four days, visiting leaders from industry, commerce, and finance. At that time, the China-Japan Trade Association will hold a general meeting of members to celebrate. It is reported that the association will also launch an invitation to various groups to prepare for the welcome.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Silk and Satin Industry Association Petitioned Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hoping to forward to the Central Government</p>
<p>To Maintain the Uniform Regulations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association and the Motor Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association believe that our country's formal attire for men and women has long been stipulated by the Ministry of Interior's Uniform Regulations, with blue robes and black jackets, and the materials for formal attire are limited to domestic products, which was also officially promulgated in April of the 18th year of the Republic of China. Recently, some people have petitioned the Ministry of Interior, saying that long gowns and mandarin jackets are remnants of the Manchu Qing Dynasty and are outdated and should be abolished as soon as possible. Continuing to follow and use them will affect national psychology and hinder national revival. The chairman of the association, Luo Qinghua, and others, believe that the uniform systems of various countries have their own special circumstances and their own domestic products. Therefore, the Japanese Restoration did not abolish the kimono. Our country's silk has a long history and culture and is a sideline industry for rural areas. Taking it as formal attire is graceful and dignified, and using it as everyday wear is luxurious and comfortable. It seems that we should not ignore the fundamentals and follow the trivial, abandon ourselves and follow others, abolish robes and jackets, and cause trimming the feet to fit the shoes, affecting people's livelihoods. If it is a remnant of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, then it should not be rejected, because the Premier personally created the Republic, which originally united the five ethnic groups into one family. Insisting on avoiding and abandoning it would be tantamount to excluding the Manchus from the country, recognizing Manchuria as not our territory, and cutting off the Manchus' psychology of defecting. If it is inconvenient to work, then formal attire is used, and convenience is not taken. Everyday wear also follows personal habits, and it is not forbidden to wear short clothes, so they can coexist without conflict. Based on the above, Luo Qinghua, together with Cai Shengbai, Bai Xingcha, Lou Fengshao, Shen Ji'en, Pan Yisheng, Pan Runsheng, Gao Shiheng, and other representatives, went to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau of this city at 10:00 AM yesterday to petition, hoping to forward it to the Central Government, and unanimously advocated that the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Department, Tao Baichuan, and the Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Huanru, received them. They deeply appreciated the petition's opinions and agreed that according to our country's habits and economy, there was no need to modify the uniform system, and promised to forward it to the Central Government. The representatives will take the night train to Beijing today to petition the Ministry of Interior and other agencies.</p>
<h3>The Executive Committee of the Money Industry Association Proposes Members to Revise Industry Regulations</h3>
<p>Shao Yanshan and four others</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Industry Association held its 34th executive committee meeting at its clubhouse on Ningbo Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. The attendees included committee members Shao Yanshan, Liu Wuqiao, Zhang Wenbo, Wang Jiemei, Zhang Mengzhou, etc., chaired by Shao Yanshan and recorded by Ge Huaiqing. Regarding the annual meeting resolution of the Inner Garden, the case of organizing a committee to revise industry regulations, it was resolved that the executive committee would propose five people: Shao Yanshan, Liu Wuqiao, Zhang Mengzhou, Yan Dayou, and Lu Shuchen. The remaining six people will be proposed at the general meeting of members on March 2. The meeting adjourned at about 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Requests Another Extension for Reporting Capital</h3>
<p>Extend for one month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office, stating: "Regarding the case of industrial and commercial enterprises in this city reporting their brand name, address, responsible person's name, operating capital, or share capital in accordance with Article 46 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, this association has discussed with your office and extended the deadline to February 28. However, there are only four days left until the deadline, and most applicants have not received the application forms to be filled out, and other procedures are also too late. There are many shops in this city, and it is the first time that this matter has been handled, so it is difficult to apply ordinary standards. It is requested that your office consider the situation and grant another extension of one month. This would be greatly appreciated."</p>
<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter Requesting Modification</h3>
<p>Various items in the Collection Notice for the First Category of Income Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, based on the research results of the Income Tax Special Committee, sent a letter to the Income Tax Affairs Office requesting modifications to the draft Collection Notice for the First Category and the method of asset valuation, stating: "Regarding the draft Collection Notice for the First Category of Business Income Tax, at the research meeting held on January 20, representatives raised opinions and requested that the articles be added, deleted, and modified, such as Articles 5, 12, and 15 of the draft for the first category, and Article 15 of the method of asset valuation. It has been jointly resolved that this association will send a public letter No. 305 on February 3, requesting that your office adopt and modify it. After the meeting, the personnel designated by this association continued to discuss the areas where the draft should be considered, and on February 20, sent a public letter No. 320, continuing to inform your office that there are additions to the proviso in Article 9 of the draft for the first category and the addition of Article 2. Now, the results of the continued discussion are divided into the first category draft and the asset valuation section. All the areas that should be added, deleted, and modified are recorded on another paper and sent to you for review. In addition to the useful life of the depreciation rate calculation table, which should adopt flexible regulations, and whether the calculation basis of the depreciation rate is appropriate, we are seeking opinions from relevant parties, and the collection notice for the second category income and the third category income will be discussed further and reported in another letter. All the items that were requested to be modified in the two public letters No. 305 and No. 320 are now included together, so that your office can easily handle them together. As for the points that are requested to be corrected this time, there are reasons that need to be briefly explained. For example, Article 171, Paragraph 2 of the Company Law states that if the public reserve exceeds one-half of the total capital, it is only allowed to distribute dividends first, and it is not a restriction on further drawing of public reserves. The draft uses the provisions allowed by the Company Law and compares them to the provisions of restriction in Article 11, which seems to be a legal mistake. Item 13 states that the income tax that has been paid should be deducted from the income tax payable. If the deduction is not enough, it should be allowed to be refunded, which is a matter of course. The collection notice is a procedural law, and it is inconvenient to cite it without this provision, so it should be added. In addition, the useful life of the depreciation rate calculation table specified in the asset valuation method is too fixed. In addition to sending letters to the Architects Association, the Engineers Association, etc., to solicit opinions, a flexible provision should be added to the calculation table so that there is room for flexibility when needed in practice. Item 18 of the valuation method states that inventory consumption shall not exceed 5% of the book inventory amount. The variety of commodities is wide, and the degree of consumption varies depending on the nature of the goods. It is difficult to predetermine a uniform standard. This item should be completely deleted. Although Item 19 has the five words "or other reasons" as a general provision, the conciliation procedure precedes bankruptcy, and there are many discounted settlements. Therefore, it is proposed to add the two words "conciliation" under the escape clause or above bankruptcy to make it complete. The word "legitimate" in the phrase "after legitimate collection" in the same item seems strict and is actually redundant. Under what circumstances is it legitimate collection, and what is an illegitimate collection? This clause is superfluous and causes disputes and should be deleted. Most of the accounts receivable amortized in installments as mentioned in Item 21 are unable to be paid in full, and there are actions for installment payments. It is not yet known whether the principal can be paid on time, let alone the interest rate. If the present value is calculated according to the interest rate as the valuation standard, it is only to inflate the books, which is not in line with the actual capital, and it is not the purpose of striving for accurate valuation. This item should also be completely deleted. As for the other items that are proposed to be modified and added, it is considered unnecessary to explain them, and they are not detailed in the letter. Accordingly, the articles are attached separately. Please check and handle it. This is addressed to the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance.</p>

(6) Please delete the last sentence "but it is limited to nine-tenths of the original price" in this item.</p>
<h3>Repairing the Shanghai-Nagasaki Submarine Cable is Extremely Difficult</h3>
<p>Work Suspended Temporarily</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, the submarine cable between Shanghai and Nagasaki suddenly became disconnected due to a malfunction that occurred before dawn on the 14th. The Japanese Ministry of Communications sent a repair ship to repair it urgently. However, due to the dense fog covering the sea recently, various inconveniences have occurred in the operation, so that there is still no clue. It was also found that the location of the cable break, according to the measurement results, although it was determined to be outside Wusongkou, about forty or fifty miles from Baoshan, the Ogasawara repair ship, which was ordered by the Ministry of Communications to search there, has been shrouded in dense fog for the past two or three days, unable to distinguish anything nearby, making it difficult to start. Moreover, the place where it was picked up is very different from the initial electrical measurement due to the relationship of fresh water. However, it is determined that it must be between fifty and sixty nautical miles from Baoshan County. However, that place is also buried under three feet of mud washed out by the Yangtze River, making the work extremely difficult. It is again attacked by dense fog, making navigation unfree. On the other hand, because ships enter and exit frequently, navigation is very dangerous. Therefore, work is temporarily suspended at present, and repairs will continue after the weather clears. If the damaged place is still not easy to find, the only way is to sacrifice a part of the cable and replace it with a new cable.</p>
<h3>Workers at the Fulunheng Twin Palace Silk Factory Striked Yesterday</h3>
<p>Demanding improved treatment</p>
<p>The authorities will mediate today</p>
<p>There are more than 600 male and female workers in the Fulunhengji Twin Palace Silk Factory at the end of Tianbao Road, Hongkou. Recently, the workers demanded improved treatment and increased wages. The factory believed that the wages of the factory were higher than the ordinary, because the wages of workers in the single palace silk factory were higher than those in the twin palace silk factory, and the wages of the factory were not much different. They refused the request, causing the workers to go on strike yesterday morning. Both labor and capital immediately reported to the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting mediation. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled to send personnel to mediate this morning.</p>
<h3>Goods Entering and Leaving the Maigen Road Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway are Crowded</h3>
<p>Cotton from Shaanxi Intermodal Transport is the Most</p>
<p>The Maigen Road freight station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is recently experiencing unusually crowded incoming and outgoing goods, especially cotton from Shaanxi intermodal transport. As a result, the original equipment of the station is not sufficient for use. It has jointly requested the Shanghai bankers to take care of the goods, and eight measures have been drafted, stipulating that when the cotton cannot be stored in the Maigen Road warehouse, all cotton transported to the bank warehouses will be stored, and the unloading fees, warehouse rent, fire insurance, and other fees will be paid by the cargo owners according to the prescribed rates. However, the shunting fee shall be borne by the railway for one-third, with the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railways each bearing half. After the bank dispatches the goods to the warehouse, it will issue a warehouse receipt and send it to the stationmaster of the Maigen Road freight station for safekeeping. When the cargo owner picks up the goods, they should still contact the freight station, and the stationmaster will transfer the warehouse receipt to pick up the goods from the bank warehouse. The above measures have been submitted to the Ministry for approval.</p>

<h3>Re-trial of the Yang Huiqi Kidnapping Case Postponed</h3>
<p>Because the main suspect was injured in the arrest and has not yet recovered</p>
<p>Yang Rongfu, the owner of the Dachang Porcelain Shop at No. 13 ( ) on Route愷自遞 in the French Concession, and a native of Wuxi, had his six-year-old son, Huiqi, kidnapped on the morning of the 17th of last month while playing at the entrance of the alley. The kidnapper, Cai Fuxing (who was Yang's chauffeur), colluded with accomplices to abduct him and extort 2,000 gold pieces for his release. Yang reported this to the French Concession police. Detectives arrested Cai Fuxing and his accomplices Wu Jinshu, Chen Shouming, Shi Dewu, and four others. After being escorted to the 22nd court for interrogation and detention for investigation, the kidnappers secretly sent someone to send the little victim to the vicinity of Yang's shop on the night of the 19th of this month because they failed to obtain ransom. They ordered him to go home. The details have been reported in this newspaper. This case was heard yesterday morning by the judge of the Special Court, Chen Shuoying, in the First Criminal Court. According to the police department's lawyer, Cai Fuxing, a key suspect in this case, was injured when he was arrested and was sent to the hospital for treatment but has not yet recovered. The police department requested another extension because the investigation procedures had not yet been completed. The court verified the report, briefly questioned the defendants in the case, and approved the postponement of the retrial. The defendants were still remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Law Professor Injured in Car Accident</h3>
<p>Car Owner Zhou Jue Now Charged</p>
<p>Zong Libai, alias Wei Ya, a native of Changshu, who has been a professor in various university law departments, was visiting a friend at the Y品香 Hotel on Yuqiao Road at 9 p.m. on January 3 this year. After getting out of the car, while crossing the road from west to east, a car with license plate number 11896 suddenly sped towards him without honking, knocking Zong down and injuring his right foot. The Chinese and foreign officers from the old patrol station arrived and sent Zong to Renji Hospital. Zong then returned home and sought treatment from Chinese and Western doctors. After an X-ray examination, it was determined that his right knee was fractured and he would not be able to move without two months of treatment. Zong has now found out that the car with license plate number 11896 belongs to Zhou Jue (also known as Zhicheng), the current director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, and the driver is Xia Ahua from Ningbo. He has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing Xia of violating Article 284 of the Penal Code for negligent injury and also listing Zhou Jue as a defendant in accordance with Articles 191 and 195 of the Civil Code, demanding that they be jointly and severally liable for medical expenses and other fees of 1,312 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, the case was specially heard by Judge Tie Rongduo of the Special Court's Criminal Division Five. The plaintiff, Zong Wei Gong, did not appear, but the defendant, Xia Ahua, and his defense lawyer, Ling Xiehong, appeared in court. Lawyer Ling stated that Zhou Jue had gone to Beijing on business and that he was representing him. Subsequently, the plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Ming, stated the facts of the case and questioned Xia Ahua. Xia Ahua stated that the plaintiff's car was in front and his car was behind. When they arrived in front of the Y品香 Hotel, the plaintiff's car stopped, and the plaintiff came out from in front of the car. When his car drove past, the plaintiff heard his car's horn and panicked, tripping on a stone bar and getting injured. His car did not actually hit the plaintiff. After Judge Dai's questioning, the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Falsely Accused Sentenced to Three Months</h3>
<p>Suspended for Three Years</p>
<p>Lawyer Xuan Zhendong represented Sheng Sheng Company in suing Zhang Jinrong, a native of Huaicheng living at 29 Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, for owing more than 300 yuan. The High Court's second instance judgment ruled that, according to law, there could be no third instance appeal for cases under 500 yuan, so the execution was immediately confirmed. Zhang Jinrong then falsely accused Lawyer Yi to the prosecutor of the local court, claiming that the lawyer had taken 30 yuan to resolve the entire case and advised him not to appeal, thus accusing him of fraud and breach of trust. After investigation by Prosecutor Tang, it was determined that since there was no third instance appeal, the lawyer, being knowledgeable in the law, had no reason to deceive, and that 30 yuan could not resolve 300 yuan. Therefore, Zhang Jinrong was prosecuted for false accusation. Judge Miao held a hearing, and Zhang Jinrong cried, claiming that he had been fooled by others and begged for leniency for the sake of his family. Yesterday's judgment stated that Zhang Jinrong, intentionally causing others to be subject to criminal punishment, falsely accused the relevant public official and was sentenced to three months of imprisonment, suspended for three years. Zhang Jinrong should publish this judgment in the newspaper and bear the costs.</p>

She accuses Ma Chang of abandoning his wife and children and cohabiting with a female student surnamed Lin from the 法專學院. After mediation by Lawyer Wu, he agreed to pay living expenses on a monthly basis, but then failed to fulfill his obligation. When she came to Shanghai to inquire, he avoided meeting her, so she is seeking justice. The court's prosecutor's office ordered Ma Chang to appear in court for questioning yesterday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Truth of the Head Murder Case</h3>
<p>Three Suspicious Points Discovered Impossible to Distinguish Gender The Head Was Sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for Autopsy Yesterday</p>
<p>A dismembered head wrapped in an old white undershirt was found in the coal ash in a wasteland on Lujiabang Road, Xinqiaotou, Nanshi. After the local court verified the report from the landlord, Yang Piewan, Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang and examiner Tan Xing were dispatched to the scene. The examination of the head revealed the following questions: ㊀ The facial skin of the head had been peeled off, making it impossible to distinguish whether it was male or female. The brain should be dissected. ㊁ The teeth in the mouth of the head were even, but the age could be determined by studying the number of teeth, but this requires specialized knowledge. ㊂ The undershirt was a woman's garment. The eyeballs were still intact, with blood underneath. Due to the above issues, and the fact that the examination was already taking place in the evening, the head was taken to the court and sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for autopsy yesterday.</p>

<h3>Silk Broker Xi Ganqing Arrested</h3>
<p>Collected Account Payments and Avoided Meeting Heng Yu Reported to the Police and Obtained a Warrant</p>
<p>Xi Ganqing, alias Xi Yuyong, a native of Suzhou, 46 years old, who used to work as a silk broker, previously sold goods on behalf of Heng Yu Silk Shop at 35 Qianji Lane, Tianjin Road. Recently, Xi suddenly collected 2,166.49 yuan of account payments released by Heng Yu and avoided meeting. Heng Yu reported to the patrol station, which ordered officers Wang Bocheng and Ni Jiaxin to investigate. The detectives learned that Xi was hiding at 76 Jingxiu Road, and together with personnel from the Municipal Police Bureau, they arrested Xi and took him back to the station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division One of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baokao, explained the previous situation and filed a lawsuit against him for business embezzlement under Article 236, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, stating that no one from the plaintiff's side was present in court today, and that the county police had learned that the defendant had 1,000 yuan of embezzled money hidden somewhere and urgently needed to investigate the case. Therefore, he requested that the hearing be postponed. When questioned, Xi Ganqing stated, "I have been selling goods on behalf of Heng Yu for a long time, and it was always agreed that the commission would be 5%. But in 1927, it was suddenly reduced to 2%. Repeated negotiations were ineffective. Recently, I asked Heng Yu's owner, Zhang Jizhi, to return the 16,000 yuan of entertainment expenses for the past ten years, but Zhang only agreed to 2,000 yuan. The money claimed by the plaintiff is the commission that Zhang agreed to give, but now he suddenly goes back on his word and sues me for embezzlement." After verification of the testimony by Hong Yiye, the head of the Criminal Court, it was decided to postpone the hearing of the case. The defendant was allowed to be released on bail of 1,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Weather Turned Sunny, High Tide Lower Than Predicted</h3>
<p>Only About Ten Feet, So No Impact More Rainfall This Month Than Last Year</p>
<p>There was heavy fog in this port in the past few days, and it was also foggy and rainy. It only turned sunny yesterday, and the Shanghai Dredging Bureau's forecast of the Huangpu River's high tide did not reach the predicted amount yesterday. However, the weather was colder than the previous few days, and it was inevitably chilly in the spring. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Weather Turns Sunny</p>
<p>The city has been affected by heavy fog for several consecutive days, causing a major impact on transportation. At the same time, the continuous rain and lingering weather have been particularly unpleasant. Until yesterday morning, the rain stopped, but the sunlight was hidden, and it did not become completely clear. Around noon, the sky suddenly cleared and the sunlight was also warm and strong. At this point, the weather began to be sunny, but the spring chill was very strong, far less warm than the previous few days.</p>
<p>Rainfall Records</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Dredging Bureau's records, the rainfall for the two days of the 23rd and 24th was 1 inch, 1 cent, and 1 millimeter on the 23rd, and 4 millimeters on the 24th. From February 1 to February 24, the total rainfall in the city was 2 inches, 7 cents, and 8 millimeters. The rainfall this spring has been more than the same period last year, so yesterday's rapid clearing of the weather will greatly benefit the spring flowers, and farmers will naturally be happy.</p>
<p>Tide Did Not Reach Full Strength</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Dredging Bureau's prediction, the Huangpu River's high tide at 0:40 p.m. yesterday was on time, but it did not reach the predicted amount due to the weather becoming sunny. It was estimated to be 1 foot lower than predicted. According to the prediction, it was 11 feet and 5 inches, so except for the rapid current, there was no impact because the distance to the embankment on the Bund was still about 3 feet. This high tide completely receded after 9 p.m. last night.</p>
<h3>Lake Society's Spring Banquet Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Fourth Detective Squad Intercepted Six Robbers</h3>
<p>Going to Rob a Cigarette Paper Store in West Shanghai</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongde, the captain of the Fourth Detective Squad of the Municipal Police Bureau, received a confidential report the day before yesterday that a large number of Hunan gang robbers were planning to rob a cigarette paper store in Jiaku, Zhongshan Road, West Shanghai, at 2 a.m. yesterday. Upon receiving the report, Captain Zhang personally led squad leaders Tang Bingxiang, detectives Li Pinquan, Xu Dekui, Zhao Jinhui, Han Yushan, Li Xinheng, and others, together with police officer Zhao Bonan from the Caojiadu Sub-Bureau, disguised themselves and went to the vicinity to lie in wait.

A Browning six-inch fake pistol and a fake box cannon were found on Du and Chen. They were immediately taken back to the squad for interrogation. Du confessed that he had plotted to rob a large cigarette paper store and also confessed to his accomplices and the location where a real pistol was hidden. After obtaining the confession, Captain Zhang sent detectives Li Pinquan and Yang Yucai, along with Du, and requested assistance from the Putuo Road Patrol Station. They continued to arrest the robber Xie Yucheng at Yinghua Lane, Robert Road. After taking him back to the squad for questioning, it was determined that Du and others had formed a gang to rob with weapons and that the large group of robbers had committed dozens of robberies of varying sizes in West Shanghai and other places. They were indeed extremely heinous and a document was prepared to send them to the Municipal Police Bureau for review.</p>

<h3>Repaying Evil with Kindness, Embezzlement and Theft Committed Together</h3>
<p>Lu Guan Embezzled More Than 3,000 Yuan More Than 100 Pairs of Stolen Shoes Were Recovered</p>
<p>Xie Shifang, alias Afang, a native of Ningbo, raised funds in 1931 to open the Xinhua Shoe Store in the Penglai Market in Nanshi. The business was doing well. Wang Hanyin, a native of Jingjiang, was also an employee in the Nanchang Machine Factory in the market. Not long after, he was dismissed by the factory. Xie knew Wang and felt sorry for him for being unemployed, so he allowed him to help in the store. Initially, Wang was diligent and self-motivated, but later Xie participated in domestic product exhibitions in Peiping, Qingdao, and other places, so he appointed Wang as a salesperson. Unexpectedly, Wang's evil nature was difficult to change, and he gradually embezzled and used the proceeds from the sales and forged letters, falsely claiming that the goods were missing on the way. Xie was illiterate, so he was deceived by Wang. Later, in 1934, Xie opened the Xiaohuayuan Shoe Shop in the market and appointed Wang as the manager. Wang took advantage of this opportunity to embezzle as before. In February last year, Xie opened the Huahua Shoe Shop on Zhejiang Road and personally managed it. The two stores in the Penglai Market were managed by Wang, Zhu Senyuan from Huzhou, Wang Qinghe from Yangzhou, apprentice Shi Longsheng, Wang Deqing, and Chen Yindi. Because Xie was not present, Wang colluded with Zhu and others to commit fraud. Over the year, the embezzled funds totaled more than 2,000 yuan. Their method was to not record the proceeds from the sales and divide the money together in the evening, often amounting to dozens of yuan per day. Unexpectedly, their scheme was discovered by Xie, who sent his brother-in-law, Wang Renfu, to Shanghai to manage the business. Fearing that Wang Renfu's arrival in Shanghai would expose everything, Wang instigated the apprentice Shi Longsheng to steal leather shoes at night and pawn them. The pawn was discovered by Xie, who immediately reported it to the Detective Team of the Municipal Police Bureau. The team arrested Wang and others, and after investigation, found that the confession was true and recovered more than 100 pairs of stolen shoes. They transferred Wang and others to the local court, where the prosecutor filed a public prosecution. The case was heard by Judge Chen Kangsun in the Sixth Criminal Court yesterday, and witness Wu Jiqing testified to everything. Judge Chen, seeing that the facts were clear, began the debate and scheduled the judgment for the morning of the 7th of next month.</p>
<h3>Conclusion of Abandoned Wife Jing Haochuan Case</h3>
<p>Jing Yang, wife of Jing Haochuan, the young owner of the Jingchangxiang Iron Factory on Zhiyuan Road, Zhabei, has been married for eight years and has three children. However, Jing was not very satisfied with his yellow-faced wife, so he had an affair, which was caught by his wife. He was punished by the court for this, and the relationship between the couple became increasingly worse. Jing Yang was abandoned by him, and the mother and four children lived in a cooking shed at No. 1 Zhaoqing Lane, Zhaofeng Road, leading a miserable life. Jing Yang hired Lawyer Ma to sue her husband for divorce in the local court and to pay alimony of 3,000 yuan and all of her dowry. Judge Zhu questioned them. The defendant said that the dowry had been destroyed during the Shanghai war, but the plaintiff said that it was at the concubine's place. The judge took both parties to various places to investigate the facts. The court debate was concluded yesterday, and the judgment will be announced at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Conclusion of the Hongfa Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Mediated by Wang Xiaolai, both parties agree to withdraw the case.</p>
<p>Gu Fan, a 28-year-old resident of No. 1 Jingyuan Lane, West Xima Road, West Gate, currently an employee of Zhongfu Bank, along with his father, Gu Linzheng (who was in Japan at the time), pooled together 2,000 yuan to establish the Hongfa Company on Yong'an Street in the French Concession. They hired Zhang Shuming (currently 54 years old, residing at No. 4, Lane 65, Laobeidou, now in Shantou) from Shantou as manager, Zhang Fenke (50 years old, from Shantou) as assistant manager, and Zhang Jinhao (51 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 3, Lane 15, Wutong Road, Xiaodongdou) as an employee. The business commenced in the summer of the eighth year of the Republic (1919). By the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the accumulated public funds reached 370,000 yuan. In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the company suddenly went bankrupt. Zhang and the others did not go through liquidation procedures. Gu Linzheng passed away at this time. On April 2, 24th year of the Republic (1935), Gu Fan, through his lawyer, filed a complaint with the criminal division of the Special Second Court, accusing Zhang Shuming, Zhang Fenke, and Zhang Jinhao of breach of trust, business encroachment, and embezzlement. After multiple hearings by the former magistrate Zhang Chaozuo, the three defendants, along with their defense lawyer Dong Chi, appeared in court. The first defendant was in Shantou and failed to appear despite repeated summons. Because Zhang Shuming had nine brothers who operated nine qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks) in Shantou, the court decided to transfer the case to the civil division and suspend the criminal trial. Witness Du Yingchu was appointed to go to Shantou's Hongkang Qianzhuang with the defendant Zhang Fenke to investigate. Upon their return to Shanghai, they reported that Zhang Shuming had fled without a trace and that all nine qianzhuang had also gone bankrupt, owing more than 600,000 yuan. Subsequently, Wang Xiaolai, the former chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stepped in to mediate. Both parties agreed to withdraw the lawsuit. Yesterday morning, Qiu Huanrang, a magistrate of the Special Court, presided over a continued hearing in the Second Criminal Court. According to the plaintiff's attorney, the first defendant, along with the witness, went to Shantou to audit the accounts, and the accounts matched. He requested that the court find the defendants not guilty. The court then questioned the two defendants once more, ordered the closing arguments, and announced that the verdict would be delivered on March 3rd.</p>
<h3>Manager Wang Liwei of Jiuyi Factory Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Wang Liwei, a Wuxi native, shareholder and manager of Jiuyi Hosiery Factory located at the intersection of Route Sapey and Route Conty in the closed French Concession, was previously accused of business encroachment by Zhang Ziliang and other shareholders, also from Wuxi, for an amount of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. They presented an accountant's audit report as evidence. The French police brought Wang to the Special Second Court for prosecution according to the law. The plaintiffs, Zhang Ziliang and other shareholders, also hired lawyers Li Mo and Xi Yuchang to file a civil suit, requesting to recover the embezzled funds. Wang Liwei hired Xu Shihao as his defense lawyer and submitted all the account books. The circumstances of the trial have been reported in this newspaper. The case has been heard in court multiple times by Liao Chanshu, the head of the criminal division of the Special Second Court. After summoning both parties for investigation, the court found that the defendant had not engaged in embezzlement and acquitted Wang Liwei in the Second Criminal Court yesterday. The civil suit filed by the plaintiffs was dismissed.</p>
<h3>General Office of the China International Famine Relief Commission Scheduled to Move to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission was established in the tenth year of the Republic (1921) after the great drought in North China. Its purpose was to provide relief for natural disasters and construct famine prevention measures. At that time, the capital had not yet moved south, and most of the work was in the north, so the general office was located in Beiping. It had four departments: engineering, agriculture, auditing, and general affairs, working in coordination. Branch offices were established in the provinces of Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Suiyuan. Offices were established in Anqing and Nanchang to serve Anhui and Jiangxi respectively, and the Yangtze River Relief Advisory Committee was established in Shanghai to coordinate relief efforts in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, so as to achieve the effect of direct command. When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and the political center shifted from north to south, in order to meet the needs of the times and facilitate contact with the government, liaison offices were established in Shanghai and Nanjing. A fundraising department was added to the Shanghai office. Recently, as the work increasingly focused on the south and negotiations with the government became more frequent, the general office, being far away in the north, found communication by letters and telegrams very inconvenient. Therefore, at the last national representative assembly, it was decided to move the office to Shanghai to facilitate the commission's work. On the 19th of this month, the Executive Committee of the commission held its 158th meeting in Beiping, deciding to begin the relocation in March of this year and complete it by May. The newly appointed general secretary, Mr. Ju Ke, is in charge of the preparations, striving to fulfill the resolution and facilitate progress. It is heard that they plan to lease additional space at the current location of the Shanghai office at No. 505 Henan Road and expand and reorganize it.</p>

<h3>Unification and Peace (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>(7) Then, what kind of power should the people use to avoid war and help the central government achieve peaceful unification? I think it is nothing more than the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Exert the authority of public opinion. As shown by past facts, such as the resolution of the Two Guang Incident and the turning point of the Xi'an Incident, we can see the power of genuine public opinion in the country. Genuine public opinion never arises from those suffering from the infantile disease of self-proclaimed leftists. They only know how to oppose the government and the central government. They either say that the central government is compromising with the enemy, or that the central government's resistance to the enemy is false. Even the Student Federation in Beiping, under the command of the student union in Madrid, the capital of Spain, actually held a celebration at the beginning of the Xi'an Incident, with such a loss of conscience and madness. How can they recognize the times, and what public opinion can they have? Genuine public opinion also never arises from those suffering from the narrow-minded disease of self-proclaimed rightists. They certainly know that the Chinese people should support the government and the leader at present, but they do not understand how to build a deep foundation of faith for the government and the leader in the broad masses of the people. If they gradually leave the people, what public opinion can they have? Genuine public opinion arises entirely from the common sense and justice of the vast majority of the non-partisan and non-factional people in the country. During the Two Guang Incident, despite the good name that Chen Jitang and his ilk borrowed, the whole country sneered at it, and Chen had to flee. During the Xi'an Incident, despite the good name that Zhang Xueliang and his ilk flaunted, the whole country hated him to the bone, and Zhang had to confess his guilt. As the saying goes, "What ten eyes see and ten hands point to is severe!" If we, the people, never abandon ourselves and uphold the common sense and justice we hold for the country and the nation, remain unyielding to power, and incorruptible by wealth, and exert our most impartial and just public opinion, then the edge of our arguments will be able to give the most severe blow to any conspiracy by ambitious warlords and malicious politicians to undermine unity. How severe would this be, not just ten eyes and ten hands? Since public opinion has such an effect, it can be regarded as an important driving force for the country to embark on the road of democratization and modernity. Not only should the people make good use of it, but the government should also cherish it even more. The way to cherish it is, for example, to notify the leaders of all social strata of the situation of political evolution and the direction of national policies, directly or indirectly, so that they can have a fair understanding and their discussions will not be wrong. This is one. Within the scope of not violating the highest principles of national construction and not disparaging the central government's recent national policies, the road to freedom of speech should be relaxed as much as possible, so that public opinion can be expressed, the lower levels can reach the upper levels, and benevolent criticism can be exerted to eliminate malicious slander. This is the second. At the same time, in this extraordinary period, those traitorous publications that endanger the foundation of the country, resist the government, anesthetize the youth, and mislead them into the wrong path, regardless of what kind of imperialism instigated them, should be resolutely banned, so that they will no longer harm the group. It must be known that prohibiting harmful speech is to protect pure public opinion. This is the third. If the government and the people can both attach importance to fair and straightforward public opinion, not only will no military or politician dare to risk great disobedience to undermine unity, but the democratic foundation of the country will also be built very firmly.</p>
<p>(2) Complete the institutions of the rule of law. China must wait until unification is completed before it can join the ranks of modern countries. Of course, the minimum condition for modern countries must be a country under the rule of law. Whether it is countries like England, the United States, and France, even Soviet Russia, which was built on the dictatorship of the proletariat, is now talking about the rule of law. Not only do they have their constitutions, but also new constitutions. As for sanctioning those so-called reactionary elements by their cadres, they all resort to the courts. For example, the so-called fascist countries like Italy and Germany, and countries leaning towards fascism like Japan, all have their constitutions and defend their political systems as the most suitable for the spirit of democracy. The Japanese military has almost been running amok, but after the February 26 Incident, it had to be followed by the legal "pacification of the military." Therefore, to achieve the peaceful unification of the country, we must do our best to enhance the prestige of the law. "The prince commits a crime, and the common people are equally guilty." There must be this spirit of equality before the law for everyone, and then the country can have peaceful unification. If we blindly accommodate the facts and ignore the law, then the principles will be swept away, order will be difficult to maintain, and temporary unification will still be a paper tiger. If we want to realize the rule of law, then the completion of the institutions of the rule of law must not be delayed. The following items should be implemented within a limited time: (1) Convene the National Assembly and promulgate the Constitution, so that the whole country can jointly swear to abide by this fundamental law. (2) The provinces and cities should separately intensify the promotion of local autonomy, so that the lower-level foundation of democracy can be consolidated. (3) The systematic organization of courts at all levels should be reorganized and completed in a short period of time. (4) The prosecutorial system of courts at all levels should strive to be perfect, so that the prosecutors can fully exercise their functions and represent the state in prosecuting all criminal events. (5) The governments at all levels should follow the regulations of examination and selection in employing people, so that everyone can make the most of their talents. (6) The powers and duties of the government agencies should be defined, allowing them to cooperate and prevent them from overstepping their powers. In non-military areas, the interference of active-duty soldiers in local administration should be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>(3) Accelerate economic construction. With China's vast territory and large population, to consolidate unification, we must first have a well-developed network of railways, highways, waterways, telecommunications, and etc. Therefore, the construction of various transportation enterprises such as railways, highways, shipping, aviation, postal and telecommunications, and broadcasting should be helped by the strength of the whole people in the shortest possible time, so that the government can catch up. Developed transportation will inevitably produce genuine unification. Secondly, monetary policy must be stably implemented, rural areas must be revitalized, and industry must be developed. Then the economic life of the people can be expected to break away from the feudal era and reach the stage of the national economy in the era of industrial and commercial capital, forming a whole economic unit. If the economic life of the general public is promoted by the fundamental economic construction of the nation, then prosperity and decline will be shared, and interests will be the same. The people of each province and city will inevitably establish a foundation of fraternal unity in material life, and their strength in supporting unification will not be shaken by any force.</p>
<p>In short, "unification" is the most important need of China at present; peaceful "unification" is especially the common hope of China at present. Whether "unification" can really be achieved and whether "peaceful unification" can be maintained, we, the people, must not neglect our own strength. The Analects say, "If I desire benevolence, benevolence will come." We may as well say, "If the people desire unification, then there will be unification"; "If the people desire peaceful unification, then there will be peaceful unification." (The End)</p>

<p>Talk and Words</p>
<h3>Remnants of Savagery</h3>
<p>— Luo Jia</p>
<p>I can't recall which book it was in, but it was probably about love. It's said that after a broken heart or a significant shock, both men and women can exhibit a strange behavior, a kind of psychological disorder, called "persecution mania." This condition manifests as inflicting cruelty on the person they love for pleasure, such as severe beatings that leave the other person covered in wounds, or biting the other person's neck or some part of their body until they bleed. I have no expertise in love, having never experienced heartbreak or a significant shock, so I have no idea how or why this psychological disorder of "persecution mania" occurs, or what it's like. Moreover, I've only seen this kind of "persecution mania" in books; I haven't even seen it in American love movies. Perhaps this condition is a step beyond "suicide" or "jumping off buildings," not something ordinary people do when they cry out, "Oh God, where is my lover?"</p>
<p>However, I know that although humans have put on formal attire and styled their hair into airplane wings, the barbarity of primitive times still lurks within their bodies. In moments of mental instability, they will immediately reveal their bestial nature, using the most cruel means on the person they hate or love most to satisfy a momentary desire. If this happens in the arena of love, perhaps it is "persecution mania." Other mentally ill people often like to fight, kill, and set fires; a person who has been ill for a long time, upon finally recovering, will likely curse the doctor and fantasize about killing all the doctors in the world...</p>
<p>What's strange, though, is that even when people are mentally stable, that cruel bestiality is still exposed. Take, for example, watching beheadings or executions. What relationship does the criminal have with the spectators? Yet they applaud and cheer without reservation, as if they have an irreconcilable hatred for the person being killed. The reason is that the cruel scene of "the white blade flashing and fresh blood flowing," "the gunshot ringing and the body falling to the ground," satisfies their desires.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from the 21st reports: The "Progress Bullfighting Arena" in Guadalajara province, Mexico, advertised a program featuring a lion fighting a bull in moving language, aiming to attract a crowd. People were indeed moved and the arena was packed. However, when the event began, the so-called bull turned out to be a small calf, unable to fight. The lion immediately opened its jaws and devoured it. The audience realized they had been tricked and became enraged. They threw bricks and stones, some even fired pistols, and finally, they set the bullfighting arena on fire.</p>
<p>Spain is known for its bullfighting. Although the lion-versus-bull fight did not involve humans, the principle is the same, because the audience wants to see a bloody tragedy. In this case, the calf was unable to fight and the lion simply devoured it. Blood certainly flowed, but it was not moving enough, not tense enough. Since the lion-versus-bull fight could not satisfy their desires, they compensated by burning down the bullfighting arena.</p>
<p>Some people simply like to watch fires burn, but they call it "watching the fire from the other shore," which is a bit more "civilized" in name.</p>
<h3>Gamblers</h3>
<p>— Yu Lu</p>
<p>—Shenzhen Notes—</p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon, a Guangzhou-Kowloon express train departed from Dashatou, roaring like a ravenous viper, speeding across the fields like a mad arrow. The locomotive relentlessly emitted smoke and howled its whistle. Soon, the train entered "Shilong Station," and just as quickly, it exited the platform, rushing forward without lingering.</p>
<p>Ahead lay a vast expanse of emerald green fields, with mountains, trees, and small rivers, both sides planted with rice paddies cultivated by farmers for the wealthy, swaying in the wind, a rather pleasant scene. This place, like most southern villages, exuded a charming, near-subtropical atmosphere. But none of these delightful sights captured the interest of the passengers on the train. Of course, they passed through here every Saturday, but they never paid attention to these things. Their minds were not so free to focus on the familiar...</p>
<p>So, where were their thoughts at this moment? Peering out from the train windows, wasn't it those telegraph poles, one after another, receding backward, receding quickly backward, one after another, one after another, quickly! No! Too slow, shouldn't it be faster?</p>
<p>Ahead lay their hope, they were contemplating the happiness there, a happiness that could not be described to others!</p>
<p>In the second-class carriage, there were not many passengers. Three or four red-haired people (Englishmen) were reading horizontal lines of English newspapers, wearing frameless gold-rimmed glasses. There were also one or two young couples, squeezed tightly together, with two small pieces of luggage lying on the floor: a small suitcase and a woman's handbag. The rest were those who leaned against the windows, against the walls, those who were not travelers, but contemplators.</p>
<p>The air was somewhat cold and quiet, thanks to this group of unspeaking fellows. Except for those couples whispering sweet nothings, talking endlessly, everyone else was silent. Those contemplators leaning against their seats seemed to share the same thoughts, all with the same posture. The posture was like this: their eyes were not looking at the sky, but focused on the bridge of their noses. Their eyeballs seemed fixed, or perhaps they were rolling around. Their minds were certainly not where their eyes were looking, but rather...</p>
<p>Far, far ahead! No, not so far, almost right in front of them. Soon, the express train would stop there, and at that moment they would think of nothing else, as long as they saw everything there, they would no longer be silent, contemplative people.</p>
<p>Perhaps they were reminiscing, most likely about last Saturday. They were very good at forgiving themselves: of course, it wasn't entirely their fault, it was fate playing tricks, fate had to make them "lose," how could they not lose, right? This time, they'd get back everything, including interest...</p>
<p>Some even had a hint of a smile on their lips, they were optimists, they treated the story of taking a third-class train back on Sunday night as a joke—a great man knows when to yield and when to stand tall! If they had good luck, with the Green Dragon, White Tiger, they'd win "solo": wouldn't they travel first class then? But, no matter what they said, none of these passengers ever returned to the provincial capital in first class.</p>
<p>Thinking, of course, could be done anywhere, but too much opportunity to think could also be troublesome. So, one of them anxiously asked his fellow traveler: "Hey, why isn't the train eating today? Still not at Shenzhen, it's killing people!"</p>
<p>"Two, four, one, one, one, still one, there's nothing you can do, it's not what you want!"—This answer was somewhat nonsensical, but they understood too much about these things, and didn't find it strange at all. They grinned, smiled, and then threw their thoughts out the window, towards Shenzhen. Only there would they have the leisure to chat idly; not here.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the whistle shrieked wildly. The shadow of a large shed flashed before them. The sound was unexpectedly loud, several Westerners glanced over with surprise. At this moment, the train slowed down and entered the platform. A sign with the station name rushed into their eyes. The conductor shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Shenzhen! Shenzhen..."</p>
<p>Following that, everyone rushed down. The carriages were empty of those passengers who were not travelers.</p>
<h3>Bewilderment</h3>
<p>— Wang Shengtian</p>
<p>My elderly mother sent a letter from the countryside, saying:</p>
<p>"...Shanghai women are no good. Didn't Ah Si fail to finish his studies because of a woman? I think you know that, and you're the most sensible of your brothers... The Zhang family has sent someone to propose marriage. I think you're already in your twenties. This marriage would be a good match..."</p>
<p>I don't want just a wife; I think I should have a companion. Prompted by this letter, I began to pay attention to "women"!</p>
<p>Every night, when I open my books and stay up late, I feel a sense of loneliness chasing after me. When I read Gorky's works, it seems like there are more female protagonists than usual, and they are written as so beautiful and charming; "Woman is the eternal mother of human sorrow," Gorky's words are constantly in my mind! I think, what the hell is this? But I don't have an answer!</p>
<p>Every day I still carry my satchel and go to school to meet the blackboard and chalk, hand in hand. Before, I was always alone in the teaching office, never joining in the colleagues' interesting chatter. When the bell rang, I taught my class, and then left. The other day, I heard an old colleague talking about women, and without thinking, I butted in and asked, "What's your opinion on women?"</p>
<p>"Haha..." He laughed when he heard me ask that question. After a while, he quietly glanced at me and said, "...A classmate of mine said that raising a woman is like buying a cow to drink milk... When you buy a cow, you have to provide it with housing, food, and care... and then you get milk to drink. But people who don't buy cows also get milk to drink. In Shanghai, you can get even fresher milk, whether it's the Butterfly brand or A-grade sterilized milk..."</p>
<p>When the sun sets, I drag my body back to my tiny room, knowing that it's early spring and soon it will be suffocatingly hot. Habits can be tiring and painful. From today on, I should give up those thoughts!</p>
<p>"What are women like? They are so beautiful, so gentle; I know Baudelaire wrote delicately about how they intoxicate people..."</p>
<p>This question remains unanswered. I am just confused, sometimes acting foolish so that I can forget it.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Famous Doctors</h3>
<p>— Qun Ying</p>
<p>We know about the "All-Star Gala," where famous performers gather to sing their signature opera pieces. Watching such a gala is sure to be vibrant and uplifting!</p>
<p>Now, there's also a "Gathering of Famous Doctors." What's that all about? It turns out that famous doctors from Shanghai, such as renowned physicians and surgeons Diao Xinde, Tan Yili, Luo Chuanrong, Yu Xinyan, Wang Qiling, Weng Xuxiu, and Xu Xinbo; renowned venereologists Li Jingwen; renowned ophthalmologist Zhang Fuxing; renowned dentist Zhou Jiazhao; renowned gastroenterologist Zhu Baolin; renowned urologist Chen Bangdian; and renowned hemorrhoid specialist Ge Jing, are all hanging their shingles and providing consultations at the Wuzhou Building on Fourth Avenue. This is because the consulting rooms inside the Wuzhou Building have all been designed by experts. The complete consulting rooms allow the famous doctors to fully utilize their skills, and patients will know where to seek help.</p>
<h3>Boudoir Complaint</h3>
<p>— Zhen Ni</p>
<p>The boudoir is where women reside. Because it is an inner room, it is also called the "deep boudoir." Women from respectable families are commonly called "boudoir beauties."</p>
<p>"Boudoir Complaint" refers to women's grievances. From ancient times to the present, women have always had more grievances than men. This is because women are more sedentary and less active, leading to physiological conditions such as irregular menstruation, physical weakness, and blood deficiency, all of which can lead them to a state of pessimism and melancholy. However, in ancient times, because medicine was not well-developed, many women in their boudoirs ended up dying with grievances! Nowadays, there are effective medicines. For example, taking "Monthly Red" can promote blood circulation, regulate menstruation, soothe the liver, and relieve depression, ensuring smooth and regular periods. Taking "Women's Treasure" can nourish blood, regulate menstruation, and tonify deficiencies, preserving youthful beauty. Both of these medicines are products of the Wuzhou Pharmacy.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>...Yesterday, again, it was late at night, and I was drowsy, not expecting a small tabby cat to "meow..." by my bed, scaring me so much that I got up to check with a candle. The little tabby cat's paws were holding a mouse, its eyes staring at me, blood dripping, and when I put the candle on the table, I was struck as if by lightning, and I became clear-headed!</p>
<p>I looked at my watch, it was already two o'clock, and turning around in my room, I thought to myself, "It's going to be another sleepless night!"</p>
<p>I casually grabbed a book from the bookshelf, Chekhov's essays, and flipped to: "Women wither without male companions, men become clumsy without female companions!" "A man who cannot win a woman's heart with a kiss cannot take her heart by force."</p>
<h3>Gambling Raid</h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>I was returning from my home and encountered heavy snow along the way. I arrived home at dusk, my hands and feet frozen stiff. My mother told me to lie on the heated kang to warm up properly. After lying there for a while, the frozen areas began to itch. I sneezed a couple of times, and my back still felt like it was covered in ice. My mother touched my head and said it was burning hot. I fell asleep in a daze.</p>
<p>As I slept, there was a commotion outside. I listened and the sound grew louder and louder. I impatiently poked my head out from under the covers and asked my mother:</p>
<p>"Why are they making such a racket?"</p>
<p>"They're gambling in the cart shed."</p>
<p>"Aren't they afraid of a gambling raid?"</p>
<p>"During the New Year holidays, they found some people and bribed the police in the Public Security Bureau."</p>
<p>"How much money?"</p>
<p>"Eight yuan a day for a pai gow game."</p>
<p>The noise grew even louder. Suddenly, there was a clatter and bang, mixed with:</p>
<p>"Shoot him!..."</p>
<p>"Catch him! Catch him! Grab his leg!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a flash of light shot over my mother's shoulder, shining directly in my eyes. Then, a policeman rudely pulled me out of bed. I shuddered and quickly jumped off the kang, grabbed his arm, and asked:</p>
<p>"Why are you pulling me?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer a word, grabbed my cotton quilt and searched my pockets. There, I had four yuan and eighty cents. He flashed and stuffed it into his own crotch, turned around, grabbed my hair, and dragged me out the door.</p>
<p>My father was at the doorway arguing with that black-skinned rat (what we here call patrol officers "street-sneaking dogs" or "black-skinned rats"), pushing me, me pushing you, no one able to budge the other.</p>
<p>The patrol officer who was fighting with me, because I had been scolding him as a robber and made him angry, grabbed the sleeve of my jacket, heaving and panting, shouting:</p>
<p>"We'll go see the patrol captain! This is outrageous!"</p>
<p>I wanted to talk to him reasonably, so I followed him out to the outer room without even putting on my shoes. It turned out that the patrol captain was waiting outside the door. I told him that the kid had robbed my money and pulled my hair for no reason. He seemed to be deaf, pointing at me with one finger and shouting:</p>
<p>"Why don't you arrest him for me, arrest him!"</p>
<p>My father, blood dripping from his forehead, walked over and said:</p>
<p>"Patrol Captain, this son of mine just came home from out of town and has a fever. If there's anything big or small, I'll take care of it."</p>
<p>Like selling fish, a large group of gambling ghosts were tied together with hemp rope, the patrol officers whipping those who didn't want to walk. Some people were grumbling:</p>
<p>"I said I'd bet the last hand and leave, but you insisted on betting another side!"</p>
<p>"The dealer got four points and swept the board... Sigh, can you loosen the rope a little? Officers!"</p>
<p>"Shut your mother's mouth! Move along!"</p>
<p>On the third day, the bureau sent a notice saying to prepare six yuan for the fine. In the afternoon, my mother took her silver bracelets, which she had worn when she married, to the small pawnshop and exchanged them for five yuan. It wasn't until the street watchman beat the third watch of the night that my mother helped my father back home. Both of his thighs were swollen from the beating, saying it was because they were one yuan short of the fine. (Jidong Miscellany)</p>

<p>Opening Verse "Floral Moon Linked Pearls"</p>
<p>Spring River Flower Moon is most prosperous. Moon reflects flower wall, flowers and moon together. Flowers love moon, flowers love moon. Moon moves flower shadow, moon moves flower. Flowers bloom awaiting the moon, zither stops playing. Moon urges flowers to bloom, drums beat wildly. Fallen flowers fill the ground with golden characters. A crescent moon is like a jade hairpin. The flowery world is ever in spring. Monthly tides never fail. Bright moon, a round jade axe. Plum blossoms, three movements plucked on a brass pipa. Jiang Lang dreams of a flower-growing brush. Zhang Ziyou wanders on a moonlit raft. Face like peach blossom, eyebrows like moon. Moon in water, flower in mirror. May the old man in the moon spread the word of love. May the flower slave pick up phoenix hair. Worshipping the moon and burning incense, emotions are true. Burying flowers and jade, grief is boundless. Reeds, flowers, autumn moon, Xunyang traveler. Lonely moon, plum blossoms, recluse's home. Moon palace, sweeping with a pheasant-feather duster. Flower-lined steps, moonlit, phoenix-head shoes. Attempting to catch the moon in the water, it is all in vain. Watching flowers in the mist, pleasure arises naturally. Mast and moon, thinking of someone, sad moon pavilion. Wearing flowers on the head, walking the streets after passing the imperial exams. Chang'e lives in the moon palace. Jade maiden wipes the mirror with her iris flower. Wanting to roll up the pearl curtain to cage the night moon. Deleting bad deeds to nourish famous flowers. Fallen flowers, singing birds, spring sorrowful waters. Slanting moon, flickering lamps, late dreams. Planting flowers in the moon, guarding against rain's jealousy. Flowers bloom fully, moon peeks through clouds. Bees dance around the flowers while drinking wine. Xiao played in the moon cave, drawing phoenixes in harmony. Moon as a heavy quilt, flowers as a pillow. Flowers as the four walls, the moon as home. Heavenly flowers fall in disorder, blinding flower shadows. Autumn moon is often round, watching the moonlight. Cold moon, remnant wind, spring is desolate. Idle flowers, fallen willows, roads crisscross. White clouds, ten thousand miles, mountain pass moon. Green blood, a thousand years, emperor's flower. Moon without flowers is truly less interesting. Flowers without moon is quiet and still. From now on. Spending the years in flowery mornings and moonlit evenings.</p>

<p>Lyrics of "Swallows Fly Together"</p>
<p>Swallows fly together. Late at night, people are gone, the evening wind is cold. Remembering last year's lane. The scenery is vaguely familiar. Green garden. Fine rain dampens the moss. Cold dust on carved beams, spring like a dream. And holding mud in its beak. Rebuilding a new nest by the green canopy. Dwelling and remembering. Whispering about the evening glow. Staggered scissors. Skimming across the water, threading the curtains, trying to return. The soul clings to the weak willows. Dreams linger on the apricot blossoms. The grass on the horizon is fragrant. The building is quiet. The curtains hang. The smoke is woven. The moon is like eyebrows. But the fragrance fades quickly. The nightingales and flowers age. The rain and wind urge. The scenery is completely different. The cuckoo calls out, saying it's better to return.</p>

<h3>Leftover Sounds</h3>
<p>The Zhongnan Tobacco Company of this city has been established for many years and enjoys an outstanding reputation. It is one of the largest Chinese-owned cigarette factories. Recently, in order to promote economic construction and inspire national respect for leaders, it specially produced "Leader Brand Cigarettes" using high-quality tobacco leaves. As soon as they were launched, they caused a sensation in society. People from all walks of life praised them unanimously, deeming them worthy of the "cigarette leader" title. To celebrate with all sectors of society, they are specially broadcasting a performance at the Great World China Radio Station, featuring renowned artists. Today's program includes humorous performances by Liu Chunshan, Sheng Daidai, Cheng Xiaoting, Guan Wuling, Jiang Xiaoxiao, Lu Xixi, and others, promising exceptional entertainment. The station's frequency is 1080 kHz, and the telephone number is 82681.</p>
<p>The Yuanchang Advertising Company of this port has been established for ten years. Previously, to promote social education and expand its business, it established a radio station, initially broadcasting at a frequency of 840 kHz, later changed to 1120 kHz. At that time, because all broadcasting frequencies were already fully allocated, the company shared the same frequency with the Asian Sound Radio Station of this city, which has continued until now for many years. Now, the Yuanchang Radio Station, in order to increase educational and other excellent programs, has specially applied to the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to exclusively use a frequency of 1480 kHz for broadcasting starting from March 1st, thus increasing the broadcast range.</p>
<p>Following the public solicitation for members by the Shanghai Society in this newspaper on the 24th of this month, many people from all walks of life have sent letters and visited our office requesting to join. Due to the quota being full, many have made wasted trips, for which we sincerely apologize. Currently, there is still one vacancy for a female member. Those wishing to join can come to our office at 851 Beijing Road. Additionally, the distribution of "Beautiful Woman" songs by our society has been slightly delayed due to excessive requests. We hope for understanding from all sectors.</p>

<h3>Amateur Dramatic Club Holds a Night of Song and Dance</h3>
<p>The Amateur Dramatic Club of Shanghai held a "Night of Song and Dance" at the Lyceum Theatre the night before last. The program was extremely exciting, so despite the rain, Chinese and foreign guests continued to arrive. The first program was Shakespeare's famous play "The Merchant of Venice," with the actors all being foreigners. The second program, such as "Xiaoqing's Hanging Shadow," "Autumn Moon in the Han Palace," "Chang'e Flies to the Moon," and "Hongluan Wedding," were purely sung by Chinese artists. "Xiaoqing's Hanging Shadow" was a Cantonese opera, sung in ancient costume by Madam Liu, with a beautiful background and crisp singing, earning applause from the audience. "Autumn Moon in the Han Palace" was a Cantonese music piece, with instruments including pipa, yangqin, xiao, and erhu, creating a wonderful, varied melody. "Chang'e Flies to the Moon" was a beautiful dance drama starring Madam Dong. "Hongluan Wedding" was similar to Xiong Shiyi's adaptation of "Wang Baochuan." This play featured excellent singing and acting, and the plot was particularly tightly woven, making it the most moving program of the evening.</p>
<h3>Cathay Presents "Founding Heroes"</h3>
<p>A Great and Thrilling Historical Patriotic Epic</p>
<p>Cecil Rhodes is to Africa what Clive is to India (the film "Clive of India" starring Colman, which tells the story of Clive, has already been shown in Shanghai), both being great British colonial heroes. Rhodes, with a sick body, traveled far to South Africa, managing and operating there with all his efforts. Although doctors warned him that his death was near, he didn't care. When strong enemies hindered his plans, he was never afraid. He finally grasped the authority of diamond mines, won the hearts of countless women, conquered the wilderness, created an empire, changed the color of the world map, and left a legacy that would last forever. The film "Rhodes of Africa," which opens today at the Cathay Theatre, depicts Rhodes' life-long struggle in South Africa and the fierce racial wars of the time. The role of Rhodes is played by first-class superstar Walter Huston, who gives a vivid performance. It is said that the film was shown for two consecutive weeks in major theaters in New York and Los Angeles, with great box office success, causing a sensation, which is enough to prove the film's true value.</p>
<h3>Scenes from "Wealth and Glory"</h3>
<p>"Wealth and Glory," although a comedy from beginning to end, contains many very serious patriotic scenes.</p>
<p>The best way to satirize the dark side of society is to present it imperceptibly, and "Wealth and Glory" has done this.</p>
<p>The performance of "Wealth and Glory" is done in a completely relaxed manner, so it is more easily accepted by the audience.</p>
<p>People with money should use it properly. "Wealth and Glory" satirizes misers and tells people how to use money.</p>
<p>Director Wen Yimin did not even rest on Lunar New Year's Eve to rush to film "Wealth and Glory," truly a devotee of art.</p>
<h3>Free "Chasing Han Xin" Script</h3>
