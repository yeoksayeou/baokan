<h3>國防綫上（五）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>我喃喃地說：“不過時間方面，因為……我想，我祇打算停留頂多一個禮拜的</p>
<p>於是，這位朋友立刻攔住了我的話。他一再說著晉見閻先生的必要；否則的話，“到山西不晉見閻先生，未免遺憾了。”結尾，他強調地說：“閻先生已經說過要見見你了，你何妨等等呢？”</p>
<p>這一來，我也感到不等的不合適了。好在對面說話的，是一位知己朋友，我還是喃喃著：“怕的就是時間太久，因為——</p>
<p>“不要緊：在這幾天裹，我們再設設法看”。</p>
<p>果然，就在第三天，我那位朋友，趁閻先生剛剛有幾十分鐘空暇的當兒，他上去回明了；於是，在綏署的會客廳裹，閻先生立刻接見了我。我們出來的時候，碰到交際處的各位，連他們也詫異閣先生那時能抽出幾十分鐘的空暇，見一個新聞界的人談話。</p>
<p>從這件事裹，我深切地感到，閻白川先生對於新聞報道的重視和開誠。（那次會談的詳細情形，下面是要記出來的。）</p>
<p>其次，山西各方面負責人士，當我在山西考察訪問時，熟朋友老同學固不必說，就連新朋友，也都一見如故，彷彿彼此了解很深似的。這些事，舉例却舉不勝舉；我隨便舉一兩樁吧。</p>
<p>沒有出現以前，就有一位山西的朋友，向我提起過梁化之先生。他說：“他對山西各方面情形，是第一個然悉的人。你到山西，可以會他談談。”我到了山西以後，也有許多朋友，一再地對我說：“化之不可不見見，化之不可不見見。”</p>
<p>然而，我向他們打聽了一下，據說，梁先生是最忙的人。他的職位，有許多個，如綏署秘書，軍政委員會委員，又兼政訓部主任，…………等等，而尤其重要的，是他和閻百川先生間，有着姻婭的關係。十多年來，一直是在閻先生左右。我又打聽他的住處，據說，一共有二個。</p>
<p>“那末到那裹訪他最方便呢？我問。</p>
<p>這，連朋友們也都意見分歧了；而後一致的結論，還是：梁先生太忙，隨便那一處訪他，也不易會得見。於是，我有點納悶起來。</p>
<p>而朋友們見面呢，還是向我催問着：“化之怎麼不見見呢？化之怎麼不見見呢？”</p>
<p>就在我納悶著應用什麼方法去拜訪他的時期，有一天晚上，忽然有位不認識的人來訪我了。</p>
<p>“貴姓”我問。</p>
<p>他笑嘻嘻地掏張名片給我。看了看名片，又向他軍裝上打量了一下，我高興地跳起來了。</p>
<p>“哦，你就是梁化之先生呀”！</p>
<p>我們興奮地握着手，連自我介紹也没有，就毫無隔阂地傾談起来。此後，他一共來看我幾次，每次，我總把問題毫無顧忌地提出去；他也用着一種異常誠懇的態度，詳細地答覆我。我們彼此間，已經很了解了似的。</p>
<p>老同學們對我的熱心幫助，也是不能忘記的。我想舉出喬雲塵先生為例吧。他在山西任主張公道團總團部副秘書主任，巳經二三年了。那天，我到他家裹去看他的時候，他正在屋裹吃午飯，從玻璃窗裏遠遠瞧見了我，立刻跳起來，嚷：</p>
<p>“啊，你為什麼剛剛來呀？一個多月前，接到南京老薩的信，知道你就要到山西來的。嗨，我們盼望你來已經好久了！嗨！”</p>
<p>他一直興奮地說着，飯也顧不了吃，連我插言的機會也沒有。</p>
<p>顯然的，他已經被一種興奮的情緒給圍着了。我這回在山西，得到他的幫助和便利，算是最多而且最大。</p>
<p>此外，許多位老同學，許多位熟朋友，許多位新朋友，他們對我的到來，都感到興奮和熱烈。我有所問，他們一一詳答，我想看的處所，他們一一允許，或代為接洽：我想參考的文件，他們一一代為搜集。在這裹，我不能一一舉出他們的台銜，然而，他們的盛意，我是感謝的。並且，我聽到次數最多，而也深深記得的，就是上面這兩句話：</p>
<p>“你這人到山西，有着很大的意義，我們非常興奮。”</p>
<p>“我們相信，你一定能在適當的方式下，把你觀察所得，和你的觀感，忠實地向國人傳播的。”</p>
<p>然而，什麼是他們覺得的“意義”呢？什麼會使他們“興奮”呢？什麼使他們對我完全“信任呢？我們彼此沒有解釋，而有了很深的了解，那末，什麼使我們達到這樣程度的呢？這些問題，我在太原時，也包圍在興奮裹，沒有工夫去分析解答。現在，我反覆仔細地分析了一下，我覺得，那一切，還是因為我們每着一致之點的緣故。一致之點是什麽？就是——</p>
<p>全国團结，挽救危亡！——這八個字。</p>
<p>好像記得，去年西安事變後，閻百川先生曾說過：“擴大共同之點，以至於極；縮小相異之點，以至於無，”的話。由記者看來，這“共同之點”的基礎，在山西，已經穩固地奠下了，這一回，我在山西的時間很短，所見所聞，當然很不完全很不透澈的；不過，僅僅就我所見聞的而論，這方面，已經給了我一個極其深刻的印象。——這裹，我就將牠寫出來，奉答山西的人士，並報告全國的讀者們。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>英帝國內部的矛盾</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>不列顛帝國會議十四日在倫敦聖哲姆斯宮舉行開幕式後當卽宣告休會。而定十九日繼續開會。據電訊所傳。英國本部與各自治領意見。不無互相牴觸之處究竟原因何在請就觀察所及加以剖析。</p>
<p>自從一九三二年奧太華英帝國會議舉行到現在。五年裏面。國際情勢有極重要的變化。不列顛帝國藉以維持其內部團結與一致的國聯盟約與華盛頓條約。都被日意德等國破壞無遺。帝國各自治領及殖民地。因和平的保障已經幻滅。政策漸漸不能一致。原來英帝國雖然只奉一個皇帝。郤有六個有獨立主權的政府。這六個政府散在地球各隅。環境不同。利害各異。就英本國而言。最關心的莫過于歐洲問題。尤其是西歐比利時。法蘭西的前綫。就各自治領而論。澳洲新錫蘭及加拿大。均位于太平洋。所懼者非德意蘇聯。而是窮兵黷武的日本。南非聯邦所懼的是侵略東非的意大利。而且各自治領的執政階級。亦有不同。于外交見解。未免紛歧。過去因為大家都是國聯的會員國。大家都希望維持現狀。維持和平。所以擁護集體安全制度。是全體一致的。現在集體安全制度破壞了。外交要以武力做後盾。干涉呢。孤立呢那些地方要干涉。那些地方要不干涉呢。大家依本身利害觀察。當然是不能一致的。</p>
<p>大致說來。自治領大多數是主張不干涉歐洲的事。而在遠東積極準備和美國取得合作。以求集體安全制度之再行樹立的。加拿大南非澳洲諸邦。離歐洲實在太遠了。匈奧波俄等國你死我活。和他們太不相干。他們為顧到英本國的利益計。未始不願意英國對於萊茵河口諸國。負相當之義務。除此之外。則當袖手旁觀。如果英國因干涉政事而引起戰爭。他們就不願意派兵相助。甚而至於會退出了帝國。而宣告獨立。或竟加入美國的。同時日本的橫行東亞。使諸自治領日夜不安。澳洲尤甚。他們公認美國是他們的朋友。他們深知英國力量。决不能單獨應付日本在東亞的挑戰。在前屈帝國會議。他們便積極主張新加坡造港。現在新加坡軍港完成。然而英國艦隊。只在南洋一帶。勉强可以應付。在太平洋的東南部。却有遠水救不得近火的困難。</p>
<p>尤其是加拿大一國。除依賴美國海軍。做他的保護以外。沒有其他自禦之法。所以在一九二一年華盛頓會議以前。英帝國會議席上。加拿大代表便竭力主張廢除英日同盟。而卒使英美携手。奠定太平洋集體安全之局。總之。就當今的大勢看來。反對英日合作。促進英美親善乃是自治領諸邦一實的主張。英國本國。要貫澈他的外交。非先取得自治領的贊同不可。所以本屆帝國會議。對於英國遠東政策。關係很大。當然。目前的情勢。與十六年前的情勢已有不同。然而英日同盟只能增加帝國危機。英美合作可以維持東亞及世界之秩序。乃是稍有世界眼光的人所共認。為英國計。為世界計。我們都希望加拿大澳洲及新錫蘭各邦的主張勝利。</p>
<h3>日本政局動向</h3>
<p>政民兩黨聯合倒閣　政府决計硬幹到底</p>
<p>［東京］對抗政黨之倒閣决計維持現狀之政府、擬向特別議會提出適合時勢之革新政策、而與政黨相見、政府內部現正研究此項態度、至於應向特別議會提出之法案、大致為第七十屆議會審議未完之重要法案、由其中選出若干再提、並加以林內閣獨特政策、而法案均限於有關豫算者至議會提出之法案、因與會期有關、當由各省充分研究、復由閣議綜合情形加以考慮、將議會召集期及提案、與夫對議會之一切關係、均須豫告協議、此項閣議大致在地方長官會議告竣後卽可舉行、（十六日同盟電）</p>

<h3>林內閣勢在必倒</h3>
<p>近衛繼任最有望　貴院議員之觀察</p>
<p>［東京］在召集特別議會以前、政民兩黨决計共謀倒閣取得連絡、當於政局之動向上影響甚巨、各方面均重視其前途、茲將貴族院方面之觀察述於左、</p>
<p>政民兩黨因倒閣而聯絡一氣攻擊政府之違法解散議會、旣經作戰以迄今日、則將來之倒閣亦屬當然之結果、政府則新設企書廳、最近又將補充閣僚、不問輿論之向背如何、而以其獨特之見解、為應付特別議會之方針、但環境情勢如此、欲求通過特別議會完全不可能、故除內閣崩潰以外、另無辦法、因此其問題非為林內閣之崩潰、應在將來繼任內閣之形態若何、此乃多數國民所希望之處、企圖實現包含政民兩黨眞正協力完全舉國一致之內閣、惟欲獲得繼任之中心人物至感困難、就理想上言之、當以近衛公爵之蹶起為最適宜、因軍部及政黨均無異議、且建設新黨亦比較易於為力也云云、（十六日同盟電）</p>

<p>㊀十三年度豫算因陸海軍實行旣定計畫而增軍費、及其他臨時費之增加、當較十二年度計須膨脹五億圓、認為萬難避免之情形、故該項豫算之編制與實施倘成為現實之問題、則物價更有大漲之虞、自應迅速促生產力大事擴充、而請求綜合增進國力之具體方策、並須向議會提出有關於此之法案、㊁增加軍費因之擴充有關軍需之工廠、為勢所必至於是培養生產力與保護勞工、亦為當前之重要問題是以企圖廳處於增進國民體力助長能率之立塲、應速行决定具體對策、限制勞動時間及其他與此有關之法規、均須準備向特別議會提出以便立案、㊂對於生產事業之勃興不能輕視原料資源之貧困、應迅速研究對策、如統制貿易•修改關稅•開發資源•以及原料之分配•供給•統制等類具體方策、應迅卽促其立案、尤以原料不足須嚴禁投機而圖强化國家的統制力、關於此事、須制定適宜有效之法規、促其實施、當為焦眉之急務、㊃生產事業之綜合發展、其動因當在金融之圓滑、因此日本銀行之轉移產業金融。强化金融統制力諸如是類、沿此國策路綫、以統制金融經濟產業、以及一切具體方案、均須考慮、蓋鑑於國家財政現狀與將來之情勢、此為必須考慮之問題、故企圖廳處於建設綜合國策之立塲上、須認眞檢討各節以促其完成者也云云、（十六日同盟電）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>天才兒童</h3>
<p>— 蕭梅</p>
<p>我們中國一向是很重視神童的，因之就似乎有過很不少，什麼六歲能詩呀，五歲能文呀，什麼什麼呀都有。現在則又有了一位，並且是近在眼前，就在上海發現。</p>
<p>據報載，那位“天才兒童”的實際年齡還祇四歲零九個月，而能讀的書則“已達四十五種六百四十一冊之多，其中如高小各冊國語，及新生活運動規則，總理遺矚等較深之文字，均朗朗而誦，一字無說”，經用比納西蒙法測騐的結果，智力已達六歲零三個月，超出標準十八個月之多云。</p>
<p>這發現實在是了不起的，可喜的。但如果家有子弟的，而他們的子弟又是贏弱而愚笨，智力比他的實際年齡要低下，那不知將有何感想？將諉罪於遺傳，還是社會環境的使之如此？</p>
<p>朱里安、赫胥黎（Julian　Huxiey)在他一篇“優生學與社會”的文章中告訴我們說，人類底各支是具有同一起源的，他們在現在之所以有某程度的差異者，完全是因為在發展過程中各支所主有的客觀環境底不同。就人底一切遺傳本性而言，尤其在智能方面，各支間實際的差異非常微小。他們間智力與體力曲綫底大部是處於重疊的狀熊之中的。假若我們調和社會環境使之均一，現存的大部差異卽將消逝無踪。所以他雖承认民族與民族间階級與階級间遺傳的差異，但，眞正的遗传差異旣可以為環境的差異所造成，且常常也為環境的差異所掩沒，因而，假若要應用遺傳的差異為優生學底根據，唯一的途徑就是消除各人羣間環境的差異，而使他們生活於同一的環境之中。在他的文章中，並且舉出例證說，“倫敦高貴學校學童之智力年，要比鄰近貧窮區中學校學童之智力年高出許多。前者十二歲學童之智力年要比其實際年齡高出一年，而後者十二歲學童之智力年却平均要比其實際年齡低下一年”。而“最近的研究結果已經告訢了我們：維太命及其他附加食料因素對於體質與精神，具有為我們所未敢想像的巨大的影響。”</p>
<p>證之於那位“天才兒童”的家庭，也的確如此：“他的母親是東三省舊制帥範的畢業生，他的父親是國外大學的敎授”，這裹除了所謂“遺傳”之外，那位“天才兒童”的環境就和貧窮兒童的環境不同。</p>
<p>我們旣知道了“眞正的遺傳差異旣可以為環境的差異所造成”，我們更知道時代的進展是有賴於全人羣的力量，而决不倚靠幾個所謂“天才”：所以我們雖然覺得有一個“天才兒童”為可喜，而更不能忘却的，則是月前據健康敎育委員會所發表的統計：本市受檢的九千飲學生中，（以一個和九千餘比較，是一個怎樣的比數！而無錢上學的學齡兒童還不在內）。有缺點者佔百分之九十稍弱！</p>
<p>不過，從這位“天才兒童”的發現，有一點却是可以帮助我們證明的，那就是證明希特勒們所呌喊的“人種優劣論”是狗屁！</p>
<h3>從灌音取供說到無聲的中國</h3>
<p>— 蕪村</p>
<p>讀了洪法先生的“以留聲機取供”不禁重有感焉。但感想不同，因此還要發一點“異議”。</p>
<p>跟人家打官司，“上訴人用灌音方法，將被上訴人在外口述朦蔽法院之情形，製成唱片……當庭開留聲機，果播出案情眞相。”這確是訴訟取證的新發明，尊音宛在，使對方抵賴不得。但我覺得有趣的，却是因這一播，不但播出“案情眞相”，還播出了一種官司輸贏祇看能否善為“朦蔽”的事實。</p>
<p>然而洪法先生以為這種發明，影響很大，將來可使人們說話吞吞吐吐，唯恐出言不愼，留為話柄。臨末他還主張應用這種方法，替在野政治家的言論灌音，以俟他日出山，作為言行對照之用。我看這倒是一種過於老實的見解。</p>
<p>“一言旣出，駟馬難追，”是陳舊得很的古話了。今之政治家，誰還耐煩管言行的符與不符呢！從前聽濤社會經編印過一本“肉食者言”，全書所載，就都是當世諸賢在野時的言論，讓大家“聽其言而觀其行”，看先後有怎樣的不同。可是，這有什麼用？魯迅先生當時就指出：這種“查舊賬”的古法，是不適用於今世的！</p>
<p>現在流行的摩登格言中，不是有一句呌做“以前種種譬如昨日死”的嗎？彼一時也，此一時也，今天上了毫，宣一回誓，翻一個身，他早已“以後種種今日生”，變為另一種人物了。</p>
<p>你想，白紙黑字，親筆寫出來的文章，尚且算不得數，何况留聲機上的聲音？</p>
<p>而灌取“救國的高論”，根本就多此一舉。凡政治家，那有主張不必救國的呢？不過救國之道，因時而異，在他們看來，應當“採取忍辱負重之精神”而已。</p>
<p>留聲機的用途，今後將以此發明而推廣起來，也許是可能的吧，但我想也决不在“平民可以利用取供”，中國的“平民，一時人約未必曾這麼好事和闊氣。灌音，是要用錢的，打官司尤其要有財勢，有手段。我恐怕洪法先生的主張不會實現（這是一定的），而相反的被用到平民”的頭上來。據說政府已經有開放言論自由的决心了，但思想統制，想必還須厲行，倘在街頭巷尾，挨家着戶的裝一具灌音機，排日灌音，就是個絕妙的辦法。——無論什麼事物，一到中國，是總要化為收拾“平民”的工具的。這毫不希奇。</p>
<p>到那時候，“平民”就眞的連嘆氣也嘆不得，祇好相對無言，變作啞巴。——無聲的中國”的時代，也就要來到了。</p>
<h3>負傷</h3>
<p>— 羅曫</p>
<p>當他打馬大大醫院底高石階走下來，他底手腕給雪凈的縫布包得臃腫着，一隻手臂吊在頭上；他底臉孔是黃色的，兩脚礓直地降下石階。</p>
<p>三點鐘以前，他們正卸着一鐵舶的大米。灰鉛版似的空曠中向下澈着細小的雨珠，給大地鋪了層溽濕的氈。</p>
<p>跳板變了顏色，印了許多工人底脚印。底下，那一條蕩着耀眼而沉悶的光輝的河增添着人心底負擔。</p>
<p>他在斜坡上滑倒了。臉是水塊一般蒼白，呌聲如同失了魂魄。可怕的降臨</p>
<p>看到那擦去了皮的紅裸裸的一隻手，脚行頭說：“把他領到馬大夫醫院去包包縫布”。算是慈惠。</p>
<p>現在呢，他已沒有人攙扶，獨自棄在溽濕的馬路上，沿屋牆走着，他忽然記起一個糢糊了的家底淡影。</p>
<p>他并不是外鄉人，（他底伴伙們盡是外鄉人，當兵的。）他有一個家：父親在轉運公司里當工頭：母親呢，在家里操着清淡的日子，也去闕紙牌，其餘的時間就和父親吵架。父親多半在喝過兩種酒後才故意挑戰，向溫和的老婆子撒野；可是他不是當眞醉了的，因為每次吵完了架，又會跑去和人們算錢。</p>
<p>他打家里跑出來已經有一年了。當他跑開以后，他井沒想到過自己會生病；會受傷。</p>
<p>“我要時時抵防着”。他覺得很安心了，呼吸是自由的，雖然冬天一步步逼來，直到凍不能動擅，夏天又翻了一個個，熱得使人倒斃，可是生活是無披掛的，除了死在盡前邊等着，再沒有第二種威脅和煩擾了。</p>
<p>“我為什麼想到家呢”？一邊走着一邊盤問自己，可是這時候，那隻手疼痛着地連着心跳，頭也像給刀割着。兩脚就不擇目的地拖他去，走過三十二號街，又穿遍梨棧大街底每一條横街，在每顆樹旁躑躅着，終於呻吟着離開去。</p>
<p>繞過二十九號街，在立興洋行後門放着的地爬子車尾巴上坐一會，他希望在天黑以前碰到老楊，問他可以借一點錢住店；可是不曾過見。</p>
<p>家，就在河對岸，過了銅橋再拐一條街就是的。他往常拉車，盡避過那條道的。</p>
<p>“他會一半得意，一半怒詈啵”？他獨自痛苦地咕嚕着天色慢慢黑起來了，都市的暗沉的天幕里攢了一叢叢的燈光，地是濡濕的而又滑澀的。脚自動拖他過了銅橋。</p>
<p>他現在已沒有第二條路好走了。他想起了母親，他底心就格外疼痛地跳動起來，兩頰給一種自嚼的力妁紅了。他急切地鑽進那個門。</p>
<p>母親已弄好晚飯。她是一位近五十歲的消瘦而疲備的老婆子，穿着舊式的華絲葛的半大襖，袖子和前胸上都是油光和破痕。</p>
<p>“我底孩子！我底孩子！你忘麼了”？像一隻衰傷的母燕，不斷地喚了出來，那位老婆子用夢中的恣式張着兩隻沾濕的手，向那小伙子怔了半天。一樓不吉的預感像隻蝙蝠掠過那幅老臉。最後才把兩手搓乾，在衣襟上，她看見不是夢境而是現實的允諾。她露出了孩子樣的笑容，好像什麼痛苦的痕跡都去遠了的笑容，又像給痛苦滲透了的笑容，一面抱住了那個年輕人；“為什麼？為什麼？”她一面柔和地，啜聲地追問。</p>
<p>他現在一句話也不能答覆出來；他只能在心里呌着；“為了大胆的呼吸和那透心的創痛啵”。</p>
<p>一位帶了微紅的髭鬚，堅實的老頭兒，提着雙黑釉的酒壺，彷彿舊日的軍官氣概般地出現在屋門底四框間了。他底眼睛射着崛強的光，駐在那兒三分鐘久。</p>
<p>窗外，初春的氣候無音地流着了。</p>
<p>老頭兒想在五十年的身世上兜過一個飛快的圈子，而後停留在一個激情而富於懷思斷片上了。他只說了三個字：年輕人！</p>
<p>楊大全……郭戀秋　其他村人……徐真</p>
<h3>走私</h3>
<p>由於某國人的褊獲，一走私在整個國上內蔓延開去形成了稅收上一個極大的損害。然而多數漢奸和浪人，更在某國人的褊護下，極力在做着販私的買賣，這種“趁火打劫”的勾當在華北已經是“明目張胆的深入民間了。</p>
<p>在北方的某一個小村落裹，數日來，每天都有運私的大騾車打那兒經過，由某國人假裝着毛子押送着。</p>
<p>這個村落里，幾十年來世代做着餡兒餅的生意，現在，祇剩李玉華一家了。</p>
<p>當夜還不甚深的時候，街上已經少有行人了，李玉華急匆匆的從外面走回來。</p>
<p>“壞了壞了！”的哼着，關上了鬥。</p>
<p>妻驚奇的停着工作問他什麼事”？</p>
<p>這又是運私的大騾車打這兒經過了，前些日子打這兒經過時，有人被他們拉了去拉車。李玉華深權自己會撞到了這樣的事，於是他急忙地把門閂起來而想逃避他被拉去。他的妻也滿以為這次和上次也許兩樣一點吧！難道大黑晚上，人們家裹都有婦女家眷們，他們眞的也會跑來嗎？</p>
<p>然而不多時，敲門聲給他們一個證明這班人確是夜里闖進他倆的家門了。</p>
<p>聽到這李玉華非常着急的告訴妻快起來，他的妻却得不在意的開了他們進來了。</p>
<p>這一伙進了李家之後，他們就無忌的對李妻百般戲濾與敲詐，我這樣吃地，我那樣吃的。</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Returns to Nanjing; Military Reorganization Plan Finalized</h3>

<p>[Nanjing] Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 16th regarding the military reorganization plan for the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. In the evening, after Liu Zhi, Yu Xuezhong, Miao Chengliu, He Zhuguo, and others paid a visit to He for instructions, it was heard that a concrete plan had been decided. Yu Xuezhong will soon travel to northern Jiangsu, and Wang Shuchang will also travel to Bengbu within days. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Those close to Miao Chengliu said that after the final joint discussion between Director Liu and Minister He today, a concrete solution has been reached regarding the military reorganization plan for the three provinces and the establishment of various military unit designations. The old Northeast Army's five-army system will remain as before, with only slight changes to the designations. Liu will return to Kaifeng within days. The first meeting of the Kaifeng Military Reorganization Committee will be extended to the end of the month. Miao and others plan to go to Shanghai on the 17th and then to Fenghua to pay respects to Zhang Xueliang before going to Henan for the meeting. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] He Yingqin returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 16th. That evening, he invited Liu Zhi, Chen Cheng, Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, Wang Shuchang, Miao Chengliu, Wu Keren, and Gao Pengyun, the representative of Liu Duoquan, to his residence to discuss the general implementation measures for reorganizing the old Northeast Army.

Various generals will leave Nanjing before the 20th to participate in the meeting in Kaifeng. However, Miao Chengliu and Wu Keren intend to visit Liu Duoquan in Shanghai as he is recovering from an injury, but whether this can be done is still pending Minister He's decision. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Baoding] Wan Fulin stated that the 53rd Army will also participate in the three-province military reorganization conference. After the reorganization of the headquarters personnel, there will be no changes. If there are surplus officers, they will be sent to the Army University for further study, so everything will not be difficult. Mi Chunlin came to Baoding to visit me the day before yesterday to discuss this matter. I have now sent Chief of Staff Zhao Ziyu to Nanjing to make a statement and visit Yu Xuezhong for instructions on everything. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Stefani Departs Taiyuan for Hankou</h3>
<p>[Taiyuan] Stefani and Jiang Fangzhen left Taiyuan for Hankou by Zhengtai Railway this morning. Various military and political leaders came to the station to see them off. Sun Chu accompanied them to Niangziguan for sightseeing. Stefani gave parting remarks, saying that he was most honored to see the military personnel at the station, especially those at the forefront of national defense. Military personnel bear even greater responsibility than financiers. Financiers are responsible for only a part, while military personnel are responsible for protecting the entire nation. He hoped that everyone would work hard. Stefani also told reporters that he had a very good impression after visiting Taiyuan this time. Shanxi is very practical in its economic construction and does not engage in empty talk. Jiang told reporters that Shanxi Province's construction is remarkable thanks to the efforts of the authorities. It is truly commendable that the economy has reached this stage. He hoped that in the future, efforts would be concentrated on developing one or two of the most important areas to avoid spreading resources too thinly. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yasukawa Flies from Tianjin to Dalian</h3>
<p>Negotiations with the Tianjin Military Department Fail; Decision Made to Cancel Trip to Nanjing and Shanghai and Return to Japan</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Yasukawa boarded a Huitong plane and flew back to Japan. It is heard that his trip south to Nanjing and Shanghai to visit key figures in the central government has been cancelled. It is rumored that the results of the North China Economic Development Conference held by the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) and the Tianjin Military Department in Dalian on the 13th were not satisfactory. Although the Xingzhong Company is not supported by Mantetsu, it is unwilling to abandon its existing plans for economic development in North China and is increasing capital to become independent from Mantetsu. Yasukawa feels that Dongtuo will not be able to fully occupy the North China region, and there are concerns about the failure of investment. In addition, his opinions were not consistent with those of Tashiro, Hashimoto, Horiuchi, and others, so his mood turned cold. Therefore, he cancelled his trip to Nanjing and Shanghai and returned to Japan immediately. The Tianjin Military Department will likely pull in other domestic financial groups to participate in its North China development project. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Resident personnel of Mantetsu in North China are scheduled to hold a meeting in Tianjin on the 17th, chaired by Ito, director of the Tianjin office. Personnel from Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, Taiyuan, and other places will participate to study assisting Xingzhong in developing the North China economy. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

At the same time, the acting consul general of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping also sent the Taiyuan Police Branch to investigate the truth and report back.

At noon, Han hosted a banquet at the provincial government to welcome Jiang. Cai Peiduan and Mu Kai, among others, accompanied him. According to Jiang's interview with reporters, the inspection trip from the north is scheduled for three weeks. He plans to stay in Shandong for three days and then go north to Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Henan provinces. He plans to go to Zouping first to visit rural construction in the next few days, and the schedule for inspecting other places has not yet been determined.

<h3>Celebratory Meeting Held in Nanjing by Various Circles for Ma Xiangbo's 98th Birthday</h3>
<p>Hundreds of Attendees Including Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, etc.; Presided Over by Feng Yuxiang, Who Also Gave a Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The 16th was the 98th birthday of National Government member Ma Xiangbo. To express their respect for the elderly and virtuous, various circles in Nanjing held a grand celebration at the International Friendship Association. Attendees included Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Feng Yuxiang, He Yingqin, Ye Chucang, Deng Jiayan, Chen Qicai, Chen Lifu, and hundreds of Fudan University alumni, including Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, Wu Nanxuan, and Jin Tongyin. A colorful archway was erected high outside the gate of the International Friendship Association, creating a magnificent atmosphere. The auditorium was set up in the main hall, with a plaque presented by Chairman Lin stating "A Rare Person in the World," and on both sides hung longevity couplets written by President Yu, "Great Virtue Shines Upon the World, Heroic Ambition Like a Youth." In the middle were longevity couplets from Chairman Chiang, Chairman Wang, Vice Chairman Feng, and President Dai. The celebration began at approximately 9:00 AM. After the guests took their seats, Chairman Feng Yuxiang respectfully welcomed the honoree to his seat. All the guests stood up and bowed three times to the honoree, and Ma's family returned the courtesy accordingly. After the ceremony, the chairman delivered a speech, followed by speeches from guests Zhang Ji, Deng Jiayan, Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, and Yu Bin. Ma Xiangbo then gave a reply speech. The Fudan Alumni Association then held a gathering at the same location to welcome former school president Wang and former vice president Liang Chou, as well as alumni Shao Lizi. During the gathering, Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, Shao Lizi, Wu Nanxuan, and others gave speeches and reports, all of which elaborated on the difficulties Ma, the former president, faced in founding the school and hoped that future generations would continue to work hard to develop and expand it. The gathering ended with great enthusiasm. Ma's family continued to receive congratulatory gifts and couplets from all sides on the 16th. It was heard that by the 16th, a total of 19,570 yuan in birthday gifts had been received.</p>
<p>Feng's Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>The original text of Feng Yuxiang's congratulatory speech to Ma is as follows: Yuxiang respectfully gives a speech, saying that Nanjing is a district of high officials, and senior scholars are especially valued by the gods. It is Ma Lao Xiangbo's birthday, and it is also when colleagues in Nanjing gather together. Yuxiang respectfully attends the grand meeting, offering his sincere sentiments, daring to speak good words and express what he has seen and heard. Yuxiang is not learned, but he has also studied the Bible. It says that Heaven creates the people and makes them rulers and teachers. Is Mr. Xiang Lao not a teacher made by Heaven for our people? The Doctrine of the Mean also says that one must obtain their name and their longevity. Does not Mr. Xiang Lao hold a guaranteed ticket for his name and longevity? Oh, how magnificent, unparalleled since ancient times. However, those who speak of the world compare Mr. Xiang Lao to Fu Sheng of the Han Dynasty. Yuxiang says, is this not valuing the ancient and suppressing the present? Fu Sheng was only in his nineties when he was old and unable to walk. How can he compare to Mr. Xiang Lao, who walks strongly and came from Shanghai to Nanjing? Fu Sheng only studied the Book of Documents, while Mr. Xiang Lao is learned in both Chinese and Western knowledge, and his reputation is prominent at home and abroad. Fu Sheng transmitted the scriptures with only one mistake, while Mr. Xiang Lao's students are all over the world. People in the world only know the ancient and do not know the present, such is the case. Yuxiang's congratulatory couplet says, "He has already reached the years of Emperor Yao in power, could Fu Sheng do this?" Truly, the great achievements and virtues of Mr. Xiang Lao will forever be the glory of the country. Is he not the Three Elders and Five Gengs? If you do not believe me, then look at the crowd's words.</p>
<p>Ma's Reply Speech</p>
<p>The original text of Ma Xiangbo's reply speech is as follows: Today is my humble 98th birthday. I am presented with gifts and celebrated by Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, Vice Chairman Feng, the presidents of the Five Yuan, vice presidents, ministers of various departments, and people from all walks of life, which I originally did not dare to accept. However, the ancient book says, "Heaven creates the people," so every day of life is given by Heaven. Therefore, living one day is one day of heavenly grace. There are 36,000 days in a human's hundred years, and in my humble 98 years, I have received more than 34,500 days of heavenly grace. I am honored that you have come to thank Heaven for me, so how can I refuse? If it were only for my humble 98 years, then there must be people inside and outside Nanjing City who enjoy high age. According to biologists, this is because their brains are not used much. Conversely, scholars and literati cannot enjoy high age because they use their brains too much. According to this theory, it can be seen that the minds of old people are simple. If this is used as a congratulation, I am afraid, I am afraid. If viewed from the perspective of you all thanking Heaven for your love of the elderly, then it can be known that my Chinese nation is very rich in emotion. How do I know this? Just look at Vice Chairman Feng's request for leave to return home, one month is not enough, and he continues to ask for another month. It can be seen that the feelings of our nation for our hometown are better than the honeymoon of newlyweds. Please look again at Chairman Chiang's ordeal in Xi'an, which was an ordeal for the country and the people. Although it was hard for the chairman, the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country for loving and supporting Chairman Chiang was unprecedented since the revolution. Archbishop Cai Ning, the representative of the Roman Curia, said that my three to four million Catholics' prayers for Chairman Chiang are so devout that even the people in Europe praying for their country may not exceed our sincerity. Therefore, when Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing, the feelings of the people of the country were so strong that even Europeans claiming to be patriotic cannot compare. Outsiders often say that our nation is like a plate of loose sand, but in fact, our nation is the most united. Because it has rich emotions, it is easy to lead and willing to obey. In the past, in the era of the eight-legged essay, there were often articles about "respecting the elderly and the people will be filial, respecting the elders and the people will be fraternal." We thought it was just a topic in the eight-legged essay, just talking about it, but today, looking at the events of Vice Chairman Feng and Chairman Chiang, is this not a living example? In the past, when Zhang Zhidong was the governor-general of Huguang, he gave millions of taels to Japanese merchants to build mosquito boats. At that time, Japan did not yet have a shipyard, so it used the millions of taels of silver we paid him to create a shipyard and build a navy. Now it can compete with countries such as Britain and the United States for hegemony at sea. It can be seen that the prosperity of a nation often starts with small efforts. In the future, if our country can unanimously promote science and industry from top to bottom, then the military preparations on land, sea, and air, and the undertakings of agriculture, industry, and commerce, will not be difficult to be on par with Europe and the United States. We talk about loving the country every day, but we must know that loving the country cannot be just empty words. I only hope that everyone will work hard in practice. Although I am old and incompetent, I am always willing to follow after you and happily see the country complete its great rejuvenation. Today, I am enjoying exceptional preferential treatment, and I am very ashamed. I would like to take this grand meeting to wish the country a long life, a long life, a long long life! (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] On Ma Xiangbo's birthday, the Catholic Progress Association of various provinces and cities, as well as various groups, sent congratulatory telegrams to wish him well from afar, which were conveyed by Bishop Yu Bin of Nanjing. Here is the congratulatory message from Cai Ning: To Bishop Yu, on the occasion of Mr. Ma Xiangbo's ninety-eighth birthday, please convey the following congratulatory telegram: I sincerely thank the Lord Jesus for the various graces bestowed upon Mr. Ma. May Mr. Ma continue to dedicate his labor in studying the Bible to God, hoping that the light of the Gospel will shine everywhere and bless all of China. Cai Ning, 15th day.

<h3>Judicial Yuan Interprets Doubts</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan previously submitted a request from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to interpret doubts regarding the deadline for re-appeals. After inquiring, the Judicial Yuan replied that, according to Article 2 of the old Petition Law, if a petitioner files a re-appeal against a ruling rejecting the appeal, it should be made to the direct superior official office. However, Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the same law has already stipulated that after receiving a copy of the petition, the original official office should send it to the superior official office with a written reply, etc., and may revoke its disposition on its own. This shows that the original official office's receipt of the petition can have the effect of initiating a re-appeal. Therefore, regardless of whether the petition was submitted to the superior official office after the deadline, or what the reason for the delay was, it should be accepted. The Executive Yuan has recently ordered the provincial and municipal governments to be informed. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Northern Route Members of the Beijing-Guizhou Tour Group Arrive in Neijiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Chengdu] The northern route of the Beijing-Guizhou Tour Group, a group of 33 people led by Wu Liande, departed from Chongqing on the morning of the 16th and arrived in Neijiang at approximately 5:00 PM. The county magistrate of the county led public legal groups and male and female students to greet them in the suburbs, creating a warm atmosphere. They stayed in the county overnight and are scheduled to continue westward on the morning of the 17th, arriving in the province at 2:00 PM. Grand welcomes have been prepared here. The tour group will stay in the province for about five days and leave the province on the 22nd to go east and return to Nanjing. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Chongqing] After the northern route of the Beijing-Guizhou Tour Group arrived in Chongqing, except for 11 members who took transportation back to Nanjing from Chongqing on the 16th, the remaining 33 people led by Wu Liande left Chongqing for Chengdu on the morning of the 16th, had lunch in Yongchuan, and stayed overnight in Neijiang. They are expected to arrive in the province at 4:00 PM on the 17th. After meeting with local authorities and visiting construction sites and scenic spots, they will return to Chongqing and then to Nanjing. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guizhou Fellow Townsmen in Beijing Hold Disaster Relief Meeting</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Guizhou Fellow Townsmen in Beijing held a support meeting for Guizhou disaster relief work on the 16th. They decided on fundraising methods, discussed asking the Agricultural and Industrial Bank to handle agricultural loans, and telegraphed the Guizhou Provincial Government to open the public granaries and charitable granaries. Those present donated 10,000 yuan as a starting point. Wang Jialie, the former chairman of Guizhou Province, also donated 20,000 yuan on the spot. The organization of the support association is to have one president and two vice presidents, with He Yingqin recommended as president and Wang Boqun and Gu Zhenglun as vice presidents. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] Wang Chengming, director of the Guizhou Department of Finance, resisted. According to reports, Guizhou's 81 counties have a total population of more than 9.19 million, and more than 2.76 million people have been affected by the disaster, with no clothes, no food, and a lack of drinking water. Even bark and grass roots have been eaten. Now they are eating Guanyin powder (i.e., white clay). People are dying every day and everywhere, making it difficult to count. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness. It is especially necessary to carry out emergency relief. After I discussed this with the central government, 300,000 yuan has been allocated and remitted for relief. However, it is a drop in the bucket. I have now asked He Yingqin, a fellow townsman from Guizhou, to visit Chairman Chiang to explain the disaster in detail and request an additional 200,000 yuan to meet the needs of relief. Various circles in Shanghai have launched a charity fundraising campaign, which may raise 300,000 to 500,000 yuan. However, disaster relief is urgent, so I specially negotiated with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China to borrow 150,000 yuan first, which will be remitted to Guizhou in the next few days to carry out water conservancy projects. Approximately 5 million yuan is needed for the projects, and we plan to continue planning and carrying them out to address the root cause and avoid future disasters. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Li Yizhi Arrives in Xi'an Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Xi'an] Li Yizhi returned to Xi'an by Longhai train at 8:10 PM on the 16th. Sun Shaozong and others came to the station to welcome him. According to Li's statement to a Central News Agency reporter, the 500,000 yuan loan for well-drilling for farmland in the province, which was negotiated with the Agricultural and Industrial Bank in Nanjing, has been agreed upon in terms of the contract conditions. Payment will begin on June 1st, and the well-drilling loan office can be established. During this trip, he was invited by Chairman Chen to inspect the diversion project and was very impressed. The wheat seedlings in the Jianghuai area this year are very good, and a good harvest is expected. On the way back, he saw the severe drought in western Henan and was saddened by it.

<h3>On the National Defense Line (5)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Shu Di</p>
<p>I mumbled, "But regarding the time, because… I think I only plan to stay for a week at most."</p>
<p>Immediately, this friend interrupted me. He repeatedly stressed the necessity of meeting with Mr. Yan; otherwise, "Coming to Shanxi without meeting Mr. Yan would be a pity." In the end, he emphasized, "Mr. Yan has already said he wants to see you, why don't you wait a bit?"</p>
<p>This made me feel that not waiting would be inappropriate. Fortunately, I was talking to a close friend, so I still mumbled, "I'm just afraid it will take too long, because—"</p>
<p>"It's alright: in these few days, we'll see if we can find a way."</p>
<p>Sure enough, on the third day, my friend took advantage of Mr. Yan having a few minutes of free time and reported it to him. As a result, in the reception room of the Pacification Headquarters, Mr. Yan immediately received me. When we came out, we ran into the people from the Public Relations Department. Even they were surprised that Mr. Yan could spare a few minutes to talk to someone from the press.</p>
<p>From this incident, I deeply felt Mr. Yan Xichuan's emphasis on news reporting and his sincerity. (The detailed circumstances of that meeting will be recorded below.)</p>
<p>Secondly, when I was in Shanxi for observation and interviews, all the responsible people in various fields, not to mention familiar friends and old classmates, even new friends treated me like an old acquaintance, as if they understood each other very well. There are too many such things to list; let me just give one or two examples.</p>
<p>Before I even arrived, a friend from Shanxi mentioned Mr. Liang Huazhi to me. He said, "He is the most knowledgeable person about all aspects of Shanxi. When you get to Shanxi, you can talk to him." After I arrived in Shanxi, many friends also repeatedly said to me, "You must see Huazhi, you must see Huazhi."</p>
<p>However, when I inquired about him, I was told that Mr. Liang was the busiest person. He held many positions, such as Secretary of the Pacification Headquarters, member of the Military and Political Committee, and Director of the Political Training Department, etc., and more importantly, he had a marital relationship with Mr. Yan Baichuan. For more than ten years, he had always been at Mr. Yan's side. I also inquired about his residence, and it was said that he had two.</p>
<p>"Then where is the most convenient place to visit him?" I asked.</p>
<p>Even the friends had different opinions on this; and the unanimous conclusion was: Mr. Liang is too busy, it would not be easy to meet him no matter where you visit him. So, I became a little puzzled.</p>
<p>And when friends met, they still urged me: "Why haven't you seen Huazhi? Why haven't you seen Huazhi?"</p>
<p>Just as I was wondering what method to use to visit him, one evening, a stranger suddenly came to visit me.</p>
<p>"What is your honorable surname?" I asked.</p>
<p>He smiled and handed me a business card. After looking at the business card and glancing at his military uniform, I jumped up happily.</p>
<p>"Oh, you are Mr. Liang Huazhi!"</p>
<p>We shook hands excitedly, and without even introducing ourselves, we started talking without any reservations. After that, he came to see me several times. Each time, I asked questions without any hesitation, and he answered me in great detail with an unusually sincere attitude. We seemed to understand each other very well.</p>
<p>I cannot forget the enthusiastic help I received from my old classmates. I would like to cite Mr. Qiao Yuchen as an example. He has been the Deputy Secretary-Director of the General Headquarters of the Justice Advocacy Group in Shanxi for two or three years. That day, when I went to his home to see him, he was having lunch inside. When he saw me from afar through the glass window, he immediately jumped up and shouted:</p>
<p>"Ah, why are you only coming now? More than a month ago, I received a letter from old Sa in Nanjing, knowing that you were coming to Shanxi soon. Hey, we have been looking forward to your arrival for a long time! Hey!"</p>
<p>He kept saying excitedly, not even bothering to eat his meal, and not even giving me a chance to interject.</p>
<p>Obviously, he was surrounded by a kind of excitement. During this trip to Shanxi, I received the most and greatest help and convenience from him.</p>
<p>In addition, many old classmates, many familiar friends, and many new friends were excited and enthusiastic about my arrival. They answered all my questions in detail, they all allowed me to see the places I wanted to see, or made arrangements for me: they all helped me collect the documents I wanted to refer to. Here, I cannot list all their titles, but I am grateful for their kindness. And what I heard the most and remembered deeply were these two sentences:</p>
<p>"Your coming to Shanxi has great significance, we are very excited."</p>
<p>"We believe that you will be able to truthfully convey what you have observed and your feelings to the people of the country in an appropriate manner."</p>
<p>However, what do they think is the "significance"? What makes them "excited"? What makes them completely "trust" me? We did not explain to each other, but we have a deep understanding. So, what made us reach this level? These questions surrounded me in excitement when I was in Taiyuan, and I didn't have time to analyze and answer them. Now, after repeated and careful analysis, I feel that all of that is still because we have a point of agreement. What is the point of agreement? It is—</p>
<p>National unity to save the country from peril!—These eight characters.</p>
<p>I seem to remember that after the Xi'an Incident last year, Mr. Yan Baichuan said: "Expand the common points to the utmost; reduce the different points to nothing." From the reporter's point of view, the foundation of this "common point" has been firmly laid in Shanxi. This time, my time in Shanxi was very short, and what I saw and heard was of course very incomplete and not very thorough; however, just based on what I saw and heard, this aspect has given me an extremely deep impression. —Here, I will write it out, reply to the people of Shanxi, and report to the readers of the whole country.</p>
<h3>Setting Up New Inspection Offices Along Various Routes</h3>
<p>Intercepting Smuggled Goods Trying To Break Through Card From Tianjin</p>
<p>[Tianjin] People from the Japanese Concession in Tianjin are experiencing great hardship due to strict anti-smuggling measures, making it difficult to export smuggled goods. Recently, more than a dozen smuggling firms have formed an organized group. Every night, more than a hundred Japanese, in groups, escort trucks loaded with goods for large-scale export. When passing through the checkpoints in the suburbs of Tianjin, they use various methods to break through. The checkpoint officers are few in number and lack strength, often being robbed and unable to act freely, allowing smuggled goods to be transported out. The Customs and the General Inspection Office of the Road Transportation Anti-Smuggling Department have discussed setting up additional inspection offices in Baoding and Xingtai on the Pinghan Railway, and in Jinghai and Cangzhou on the Jinpu Railway, to intercept smuggled goods trying to break through the card from Tianjin.

<h3>Tianjin Japanese Police Station Arrested Another Large Group of Opium Addicts Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than Sixty People Extradited to Our Police Station - Another Conjecture About the Source of the Floating Corpses</p>
<p>[Tianjin]</p>
<p>On the 16th, the Japanese police station arrested more than 60 opium addicts and beggars in the Concession and sent them to our police station. On the night of the 15th, a certain opium den in the Japanese Concession hired a rickshaw to carry the corpse of a deceased drug addict, intending to throw it into the Haihe River. When it reached the gate, it turned into the French Concession because it saw police detectives stationed there and was stopped by French patrol officers. It is not known where it was thrown afterwards. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Various parties in Tianjin are gradually disbelieving that all the floating corpses are drug addicts thrown by opium dens. Many have determined that they were done by secret agencies in a certain Concession that recruited laborers to leave the country, because when laborers are recruited, they are generally deceived. After arriving in Tianjin, they are monitored. Those who realize this and try to escape are caught and thrown into the Haihe River. Therefore, most of the corpses are unclaimed young men. The authorities have recently paid attention to this and are searching for it. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Contradictions Within the British Empire</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The British Imperial Conference held its opening ceremony on the 14th at St. James's Palace in London and immediately adjourned, with a decision to continue the meeting on the 19th. According to telegraphic communications, there are conflicts between the opinions of the British mainland and various dominions. What is the reason? Please analyze it based on your observations.</p>
<p>Since the Ottawa British Imperial Conference in 1932, there have been extremely important changes in the international situation in the past five years. The League of Nations Covenant and the Washington Treaty, which the British Empire used to maintain its internal unity and consistency, have been completely destroyed by countries such as Japan, Italy, and Germany. The various dominions and colonies of the empire cannot maintain a consistent policy because the guarantee of peace has been shattered. Originally, the British Empire only had one emperor, but it had six governments with independent sovereignty. These six governments are scattered in various corners of the earth, with different environments and different interests. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the most important thing is the European issue, especially the front line of Western Europe, Belgium, and France. As far as the various dominions are concerned, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada are all located in the Pacific Ocean, and they fear not Germany, Italy, or the Soviet Union, but the militaristic Japan. The Union of South Africa fears Italy's invasion of East Africa. Moreover, the ruling classes of the various dominions are also different, and their diplomatic views are inevitably divergent. In the past, because everyone was a member of the League of Nations and everyone hoped to maintain the status quo and maintain peace, supporting the collective security system was unanimous. Now that the collective security system has been destroyed, diplomacy must be backed by force. Should we intervene or isolate ourselves? Where should we intervene and where should we not intervene? Everyone observes according to their own interests, and of course they cannot be consistent.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, most of the dominions advocate non-interference in European affairs and are actively preparing in the Far East to cooperate with the United States to re-establish a collective security system. Countries such as Canada, South Africa, and Australia are too far away from Europe. The life-and-death struggles of countries such as Hungary, Austria, Poland, and Russia are too irrelevant to them. In order to take into account the interests of the United Kingdom, they may be willing for the United Kingdom to assume considerable obligations for the countries at the mouth of the Rhine. Apart from this, they should stand aside. If the United Kingdom causes a war by interfering in political affairs, they will not be willing to send troops to help, and may even withdraw from the empire and declare independence, or even join the United States. At the same time, Japan's rampant behavior in East Asia makes the dominions uneasy day and night, especially Australia. They generally recognize the United States as their friend. They know that the strength of the United Kingdom cannot independently cope with Japan's challenge in East Asia. At the previous Imperial Conference, they actively advocated the construction of a port in Singapore. Now that the Singapore naval port is complete, however, the British fleet can only barely cope in the South Seas. In the southeastern Pacific, there is the difficulty of being too far away to put out a fire nearby.</p>
<p>Especially Canada, in addition to relying on the US Navy to protect it, has no other way to defend itself. Therefore, before the Washington Conference in 1921, the Canadian representative at the British Imperial Conference strongly advocated the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, which eventually led to the UK and the US joining hands and laying the foundation for a collective security system in the Pacific. In short, in the current situation, opposing Anglo-Japanese cooperation and promoting Anglo-American friendship is a consistent proposition of the dominions. The United Kingdom must first obtain the approval of the dominions to implement its diplomacy. Therefore, this Imperial Conference has a great relationship with the British Far East policy. Of course, the current situation is different from the situation sixteen years ago. However, the Anglo-Japanese alliance can only increase the empire's crisis, and Anglo-American cooperation can maintain order in East Asia and the world, which is generally recognized by those with a global perspective. For the sake of the United Kingdom and for the sake of the world, we all hope that the propositions of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand will prevail.</p>
<h3>Trends in Japanese Politics</h3>
<p>Joint Overthrow of the Cabinet by the Political and Civil Parties The Government Is Determined to Push Through to the End</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government, which is determined to maintain the status quo in the face of the political parties' decision to overthrow the cabinet, intends to submit innovative policies suitable for the times to the special parliament to meet with the political parties. The government is currently studying this attitude. As for the bills to be submitted to the special parliament, they are generally important bills that were not completed during the deliberation of the 70th parliament. Some of them will be selected and resubmitted, and the unique policies of the Lin Cabinet will be added. All bills are limited to those related to the budget. The bills submitted to the parliament will be fully studied by the various provinces due to the term of the session, and then the situation will be comprehensively considered by the cabinet. The summoning period of the parliament, the proposals, and all relations with the parliament must be agreed upon in advance. This cabinet meeting can be held roughly after the completion of the local government officials' meeting. (16th Allied Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The secretaries-general of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties formally met on the 14th, so the two parties' movement to overthrow the cabinet has taken a step forward. In order to launch this joint front, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have officially decided to hold a joint party member conference on the 19th of this month. Each party will send ten people to participate, and it is expected that a joint ultimatum urging the Lin Cabinet to resign will be passed. However, on the Lin Cabinet's side, the attacks on the two major political parties are becoming more intense. From beginning to end, it will not be moved in the slightest, and will continue to concentrate its efforts and implement its so-called unique plan according to the established outline, waiting for the special parliament to be convened. Only at that time can it decide to resign, or dissolve again, or do both. In view of this situation, no matter how tough the attitude of the established political parties is, without any unfortunate or unexpected events occurring in Japanese politics, it will be difficult to encounter serious changes before the end of August. The recent silence held by the military is generally interpreted as observing whether the current cabinet has the full determination and ability to realize various fascist policies. If the Lin Cabinet has this determination and ability, even if the special parliament passes a no-confidence motion, the military will resolutely support Prime Minister Lin to realize the re-dissolution and seek the establishment of a new election law. On the contrary, if the Lin Cabinet does not have this determination, the military will not hesitate to remove Lin and welcome a stronger cabinet. What we should pay attention to regarding this point is that the current movement to overthrow the cabinet by the political and civil parties cannot be completely regarded as a movement to protect liberalism and substantively oppose fascism. It is no exaggeration to say that it is a movement to seek the opportunity for the military to regret Lin and cooperate with the military. There are three facts that prove this trend, namely ㊀ Neither the Seiyukai nor the Minseito parties mentioned a single word about diplomacy or an independent domestic policy. Even the policies that this extremely conservative party previously advocated are now abandoned. ㊁ Since the dissolution of the parliament on April 30, the only active slogan of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties has been the establishment of a so-called powerful cabinet that is united by the whole country. The military has not firmly expressed its opposition to this point. ㊂ The Lin Cabinet has accused the political parties of alienating the military and the people. In recent days, the Minseito party has made every effort to defend itself and counterattack, pointing out that the Lin Cabinet's actions are actually alienating the military and the people. At the same time, the Seiyukai is now trying to eliminate the opposition between the pro-military faction and the traditional faction within the party based on some kind of understanding. Based on the above three factors, political observers predict that after the special meeting, the establishment of a new cabinet will bring together representatives of established political parties, as well as military, bureaucratic, and financial figures. This is certainly possible. The problem is who will be the candidate for prime minister. Although Prince Konoe Fumimaro is an ideal figure, it is feared that it will not be easy to realize. (Central News Agency 16th Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Lin Cabinet Is Bound To Fall</h3>
<p>Prince Konoe Is the Most Promising Successor - Observations of a Member of the House of Peers</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Before the special parliament is convened, the fact that the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are determined to jointly conspire to overthrow the cabinet and have made contact will have a great impact on the trends in the political situation. All parties attach importance to its future. Here are the observations of the House of Peers on the left:</p>
<p>The Seiyukai and Minseito parties have joined forces to attack the government's illegal dissolution of the parliament, and since they have been fighting until today, then the future overthrow of the cabinet is of course the result. The government, on the other hand, has newly established the Planning Agency and recently will supplement the cabinet members. Regardless of the support or opposition of public opinion, it will use its unique views as a policy to deal with the special parliament. But with such an environment, it is completely impossible to pass the special parliament, so there is no way other than the collapse of the cabinet. Therefore, the problem is not the collapse of the Lin Cabinet, but what form the future successor cabinet will take. This is what most people hope for, to try to realize a cabinet that truly unites the Seiyukai and Minseito parties and is completely united by the whole country. However, it is very difficult to obtain the central figure for the successor. Ideally speaking, it is most appropriate for Duke Konoe to rise up, because the military and the political parties have no objection, and it is also easier to build a new party.

<h3>Japan Purchases Scrap Metal From the Americas</h3>
<p>Passed Through the Panama Canal Last Month, Reaching 221,000 Tons</p>
<p>⊙Colon, Panama The Bureau of Statistics here announced today that in April, 221,000 tons of scrap metal were transported from US ports along the Atlantic coast to Japan through the Panama Canal, a new record for scrap metal shipped to the Far East. (15th Kuomintang Telegram)</p>
<h3>Important National Policies Advocated by the Military</h3>
<p>Promote Industrial Production - Expectations for Concrete Realization</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The army hopes to promote various important policies in the special parliament, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Due to the implementation of established plans by the army and navy, and the increase in other temporary expenses, the budget for the 13th year will have to be inflated by 500 million yuan compared to the 12th year, which is considered an unavoidable situation. Therefore, if the compilation and implementation of this budget become a real problem, prices will rise even more sharply. Therefore, we should quickly promote the great expansion of productivity and request concrete policies to comprehensively increase national strength, and submit bills related to this to the parliament. ㊁ Increasing military spending will inevitably lead to the expansion of factories related to military needs. Therefore, cultivating productivity and protecting labor are also important issues at the moment. Therefore, the Planning Agency should quickly determine concrete countermeasures from the standpoint of increasing national physical strength and promoting efficiency. Regulations restricting working hours and other regulations related to this must be prepared and submitted to the special parliament for legislation. ㊂ The rise of production undertakings cannot underestimate the poverty of raw materials and resources. We should quickly study countermeasures, such as controlling trade, revising tariffs, developing resources, and concrete policies such as the distribution, supply, and control of raw materials. We should quickly promote their legislation, especially in the case of a shortage of raw materials, we must strictly prohibit speculation and strengthen the national control force. Regarding this matter, we must formulate appropriate and effective regulations to promote their implementation as a matter of urgency. ㊃ The comprehensive development of production undertakings, the motive for this should be the smoothness of finance. Therefore, such things as the transfer of industrial finance by the Bank of Japan and the strengthening of financial control should follow this national policy line to control finance, economy, industry, and all concrete plans. We must consider this in view of the current state of national finances and the future situation. Therefore, the Planning Agency, from the standpoint of building a comprehensive national policy, must seriously examine each section to promote its completion. (16th Allied Telegram)</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador Talks About Japan-Russia Relations Upon Leaving Office</h3>
<p>Adjusting Diplomatic Relations - Still Many Reefs</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev left for home on the evening of the 15th. When he departed, he said to people,</p>
<p>I have been an envoy to Japan for three years. I have encountered many difficulties during my term, but I feel happy in life and am very pleased. The impression of Japan is quite unforgettable. After I return to Moscow this time, I will contact the authorities and I can roughly go to Germany in ten days to take up my new post. As I leave Japan today, I am convinced that the problems between Japan and the Soviet Union can be resolved by peaceful means. Regarding the content of the talks with Foreign Minister Sato on adjusting diplomatic relations, I am sorry that I cannot tell you here, but it is definitely not comparable to hitting a reef. I think there is still room to open up. I am very sorry that I did not have enough time to talk with the Foreign Minister. I don't think we should use such wording as the deterioration of relations between the two countries. It is more appropriate to say that they are in an unstable relationship. But in this case, if we conduct negotiations in the future and reach a full understanding, everything can be handled satisfactorily. (16th Allied Telegram)</p>

<h3>New Trends in European Politics Emerging from London Talks</h3>
<p>Several Central and Eastern European Nations Are Gradually Approaching the Anglo-French Axis; Hungary Reiterates Demand for Equality in Armaments</p>
<p>[London] According to impressions gained by general observers, following political talks held here by various European political and diplomatic figures taking advantage of the King of England's coronation ceremony, it appears that several Central and Eastern European nations are gradually approaching the "London-Paris political axis." This is not only the case for Yugoslavia, but Poland also seems to be following England and France's lead. Furthermore, Central European nations, especially Hungary, are inclined towards cooperation among countries in the Danube River region. Foreigners here also believe that the foreign politicians attending the coronation ceremony deeply believe that the British government has a strong desire for economic cooperation among the countries in the Danube River region. If Britain were to relinquish its most-favored-nation treaty rights in the Danube River region, it would indeed help preserve peace in Central Europe, a sacrifice Britain should be willing to make. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>[London] The Times recently commented on the talks held between Czech Premier Hodza and British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, stating that the relationship between the Little Entente countries and Hungary is cause for optimism. The Little Entente countries could acknowledge Hungary's right to rearm, provided that Hungary concludes non-aggression pacts with its neighbors. Regarding the Hungarian government's demands concerning the Hungarian minority within Czechoslovakia, a compromise should not be difficult to reach. For example, the agreement recently reached between the Czech government and the German government regarding the issue of the German minority within Czechoslovakia could serve as a model. Furthermore, concerning economic cooperation among the countries in the Danube River region, Hungary and Czechoslovakia could establish a commercial treaty before establishing a customs preference system among the countries, as a pioneering effort.

<h3>Germany Assures Britain of No Intention to Invade the West</h3>
<p>Also Does Not Wish to Assist Italy's Mediterranean Policy</p>
<p>[London] The Sunday Chronicle and the People's Report recently reported that following talks between German Defense Minister General von Blomberg and King George VI of England, the Duke of Kent, Prime Minister Baldwin, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, and Foreign Secretary Eden, a new era in Anglo-German relations may be opening. The People's Report also stated that General von Blomberg had given Britain assurances that Germany has no intention of invading England, France, or Belgium, nor does it wish to alter the current borders of France and Belgium. Regarding the restoration of former colonies, Germany still insists on its original position, but it does not intend to urgently demand the return of those colonies currently administered by Britain. Furthermore, regarding Italy's policies on the Mediterranean issue, which conflict with the interests of England and France, Germany is willing to provide assurances that it will not support them. Germany is even willing to halt construction of fortifications along the Rhine River, but only if France makes a similar concession, the scope of which should be determined by a committee organized by France and Germany.

<h3>French Foreign Minister Returns to Paris</h3>
<p>Satisfied with London Talks</p>
<p>[Paris] Foreign Minister Delbos, representing the French government at the coronation ceremony of the King of England in London, returned here at 6:11 PM. The rest of the French delegation returned on another train. Before departing London, Delbos gave an interview to a Havas News Agency reporter, stating that he was extremely honored to have attended the King of England's coronation ceremony and was particularly pleased to have taken this opportunity to interact with British politicians, cabinet members, and foreign dignitaries. He further stated that he was deeply satisfied that repeated meetings with British politicians, including the future leader of the government (referring to the future prime minister, the current Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain), had proven that England and France share completely consistent views.

Regarding this matter, political figures in Berlin claimed that when German Aviation Minister Göring recently traveled to Italy, German and Italian newspapers publicized it extensively, with the intention of diverting international attention so that Mussolini's first trip abroad to Germany would not cause excessive surprise.

<h3>British Newspapers Comment on Imperial Conference</h3>
<p>Say Three Major Principles Have Been Discovered</p>
<p>[London] Since the opening of the British Imperial Conference, many newspapers here have offered criticisms, generally stating that, based on the views expressed by the delegates, three major principles have been discovered: ㊀ the importance of maintaining the concept of freedom; ㊁ the need for a unified foreign policy; ㊂ the willingness to sacrifice for national defense. The Morning Post stated that the main purpose of the delegates' speeches was to gather the full strength of the empire to maintain a common position and promote peace. The Manchester Guardian stated that the delegates' views coincided, namely the determination to cooperate in a way that suits the local people and maintains the inherent freedom in all aspects. The Daily Telegraph stated that the Imperial Conference's first day did not mention constitutional issues, which shows that all parts of the empire are willing to make all necessary sacrifices to ensure security.

<p>[London] The Imperial Conference will discuss plans to expand air routes between England and the Dominions. All preparations for improving air routes are underway. In June of this year, the South African air route will be opened first. The original London-Egypt air route will be extended via Karachi and Singapore to Australia. This route is also scheduled for completion this year. In addition, air routes to New Zealand and Canada have already started preparations, while air routes to India and South America are being planned. (National Maritime Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Pacific Nations Sign Non-Aggression Pact</h3>
<p>Australian Prime Minister's Suggestion Arouses American Interest</p>
<p>[Washington] On the opening day of the Imperial Conference in London, Australian Prime Minister Lyons mentioned the situation in the Pacific and advocated for the conclusion of a non-aggression pact among Pacific nations based on the spirit of the League of Nations. This suggestion has now aroused deep interest in the United States. Government officials, such as Secretary of State Hull and officials from the State Department and the Army and Navy Departments, have remained silent on the matter, but it is widely believed that the three major powers of England, the United States, and Japan along the Pacific Rim are waiting for other countries to initiate discussions before taking action. Furthermore, since the end of the Washington Treaty, England, the United States, and Japan have not expressed their views on the future of the Pacific. As far as the United States is concerned, it does not wish to take any action until its position on the Philippine Islands has been determined. Lyons' original speech stated that nothing is more important to Australia than the Pacific, so Australia welcomes the establishment of a partial understanding among Pacific nations, or the conclusion of a non-aggression pact among Pacific nations based on the spirit of the League of Nations, and that Australia is willing to cooperate with the people of Pacific nations to promote the conclusion of such an agreement within an organization of understanding and sympathy.

<h3>Davis Returns Home to Talk About International Disarmament</h3>
<p>Economic Adjustment Should Come First</p>
<p>[New York] Davis, the U.S. representative to the International Sugar Conference, recently returned here from London and told the press that it is impossible to convene a general meeting of the Disarmament Conference at the moment. We must first start by reducing the "economic armaments" (referring to various obstacles to international trade) before we can engage in disarmament work. I was extremely busy discussing sugar issues in London, so I had no time to discuss disarmament issues. However, I did discuss the issue of the Disarmament Conference Bureau convening.

<h3>Italian Black Arrow Corps Joins the Fighting on the Northern Spanish Front</h3>
<p>Looking to Seize the Last Line of Defense of Bilbao; Valencia Suffers Heavy Air Raids; British Embassy Suffers Considerable Damage</p>
<p>⊙Guernica: On the Solozaga front near Bilbao in the north, the Italian participating unit under the Nationalists, the so-called "Black Arrow Corps," has come into contact with Bilbao's last line of defense, the famous "El Gallo Line." In addition, after yesterday's fierce battle between the two armies, the highlands of Mount Jatabe between Maruri and Mungia, stretching about four kilometers in length, have been completely captured by the Nationalists.

<h3>Former Spanish Premier Ordered to Form Cabinet</h3>
<p>⊙Valencia: After Spanish Socialist leader and Prime Minister Caballero resigned yesterday, he has been ordered by President Azaña to form a new cabinet. Political figures say that the political color of the new cabinet is roughly the same as the previous cabinet, representing the united forces of the national anti-fascist faction. Important members of the previous cabinet have all been recruited, but the number of cabinet seats will be slightly reduced. Caballero was first ordered to form a cabinet in mid-September last year, which included several members of the Socialist Party and two Communists. He soon reorganized it, extending invitations to four syndicalists to join. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>⊙Valencia: Regarding the resignation of the Caballero cabinet, it is now known that the cabinet crisis actually occurred on Saturday and Sunday. During the cabinet meeting on that day, Foreign Minister Vayo immediately declared that the anarchists' uprising in Barcelona had a negative impact on the Republican government abroad. The cabinet therefore decided to take strict measures to maintain law and order and serve as a warning to the future. However, Education Minister Hierro and Agriculture Minister Uribe (both Communists) disagreed with this measure and submitted their resignations on the 13th. The cabinet members belonging to the Socialist Party (namely Prime Minister Caballero, Foreign Minister Vayo, Navy and Aviation Minister Prieto, Interior Minister Galache, Finance Minister Negrín, and Commerce Minister Teglazia) then followed suit and resigned. It is now known that former Prime Minister Caballero has been ordered to form a new cabinet and has made a statement to the press, stating that he will do his best to form a new cabinet similar to the previous one, but the new cabinet should be supported by political parties and not rely on the strength of trade unions.

<h3>German-Made Mines Found at the Site of British Ship Explosion</h3>
<p>Hunter Towed to Gibraltar for Repairs; Listed to Port and Lost Its Mast Upon Entering Port, Injuring People</p>
<p>⊙Valencia: The Ministry of the Navy recently issued a bulletin stating that the government army's gunboats, the "Uad-Lucena" and the "Asuncion Garcia," sailed to the sea off Almería in the south yesterday morning, the site of the British destroyer "Hunter" mishap, to conduct an investigation. They discovered a mine 300 meters off the coast at a depth of 12 inches, equipped with a percussion detonator. The gunboats fired 26 shots at it, destroying it, and a yellow stain appeared on the sea surface, caused by the sulfuric acid contained in the mine. British naval representatives were present at the scene to observe. It is claimed that this type of mine was made in Germany, no different from those used during the European War. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the "Hunter" explosion, the Admiralty recently announced that a joint committee organized by the British Admiralty and the Spanish Republican government has begun an investigation, immediately gathering witnesses and questioning them. Several fishermen claimed that they had seen a submarine periscope emerge from the water near the site of the ship's explosion. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>⊙Gibraltar: Based on the investigation report on the British destroyer "Hunter" explosion, it has been confirmed that the ship struck a floating mine. The explosion completely destroyed the keel, and a large hole was blown below the waterline. The water tanks and oil drums were torn to pieces. Four sailors in the mess hall were killed instantly when the explosion occurred. The ship is currently docked here for repairs, but the pumping work seems to be quite difficult. (National Maritime Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>⊙Gibraltar: The British destroyer "Hunter," after exploding near the coast of southern Spain on Thursday, killing eight and injuring fourteen, suffered another accident today while being towed into the port of Gibraltar, resulting in four sailors being seriously injured and ten slightly injured, all of whom have been sent to military hospitals for treatment. The "Hunter" was towed from Almería to this place today by the cruiser "Arethusa." When entering the port, the stern was in front. Unexpectedly, after entering the port, the ship suddenly listed to port, causing the wireless antenna to drift away and the foremast to break, injuring many people. There is now a large hole on the port side of the "Hunter" above the waterline, and the ship is immersed in water. After entering the port, it was immediately towed into the dry dock, and divers went down to examine the extent of the damage. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 15th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Tea Sales Flourishing Abroad</h3>
<p>[London] After the International Tea Regulation Committee suddenly increased the tea production quota for 1937 to 1938 from 82.5 percent to 87.5 percent, the economic community expressed surprise, as the general public believed that the supply of tea in the market was already sufficient. Tea merchants purchased a lot of tea in the early part of this year because of concerns about increased import duties. As tea merchants imported a large amount of goods, tea prices also rose accordingly. The main tea-producing countries, especially China, benefited greatly. The International Tea Regulation Committee then decided to increase the supply of tea to curb the soaring tea prices. (National Maritime Telegram, 14th)</p>

<h3>New Air Route Opened by Sino-Japanese Joint Venture, Huitong</h3>
<p>Direct Flights Between Tokyo and Tianjin, Three Times a Week Starting June 1st</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The direct flights between Tokyo and Tianjin, planned by the Sino-Japanese joint venture Huitong Airlines, have been rumored for a long time. It was not until the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Group arrived in Tokyo last month that Zhang Zizhong, in his capacity as chairman of Huitong Airlines, together with Yao Zuobin, the business section chief of Huitong Airlines who accompanied him, negotiated with the Japan Air Transport Company and decided to implement the plan on June 1st. The general framework for passengers, cargo, and mail was agreed upon. The remaining procedures will be handled by personnel from the Japan Air Transport Company who will be dispatched to Tianjin in the near future to consult with the heads of various sections of Huitong. According to the provisions of both parties, in the future, the newly purchased large-scale Nakajima AT No. 8 eight-seater aircraft by Huitong will be designated to operate on the route. Flights from Tianjin to Tokyo will be on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, and flights from Tokyo to Tianjin will be on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. Passengers who wish to travel from Tokyo to various locations in Pingzhang will transfer to other aircraft in Tianjin. The air route between Tokyo and Tianjin is 2,500 kilometers, and the flight time is approximately 8 hours and 20 minutes. However, due to stops in Dalian, Gyeongseong, and Fukuoka to board passengers and load mail, the total journey takes 10 hours and 14 minutes. The Japanese side has recently boasted about the unparalleled speed of the Nakajima-type new aircraft, claiming that it can depart from Tokyo in the morning and arrive in Tianjin in the evening, and still be able to visit a Chinese wine shop in Peiping at night. According to this boast, the departure time of the aircraft is approximately 7:00 AM, and it can arrive at the destination station around 5:00 PM. At the same time as the opening of the direct air route between Tokyo and Tianjin, there is also a direct air route between Changchun in puppet Manchuria and Tokyo, which will also take approximately 8 hours for the entire journey and will also operate three round trips per week. The Japanese side has placed the central stations for the two air routes, North China and puppet Manchuria, in Tokyo, with the intention of controlling the air transportation in both regions. Therefore, our people should pay close attention to this. The organizational structure of Huitong Airlines places the administrative authority in the hands of the general affairs section chief, the Japanese Tokudome Seiichi. The navigation authority is in the hands of the aviation section chief, Higuchi Masaharu. Higuchi was originally an aviation team leader attached to the Japanese Garrison Army, so the company is still controlled behind the scenes by the Japanese Army Headquarters. In late May, Higuchi was transferred to the Japan Aviation Company in Changchun, and the vacancy was filled by Okabe Takeshi, an aviation officer attached to the Japanese Kwantung Army, who came to Tianjin to work a few days ago. Although there have been personnel changes, the fact that it is controlled by the Japanese Army Headquarters remains the same. The Japanese Kwantung Army has no relationship with this. Since its establishment, Huitong Airlines has suffered monthly losses, amounting to at least approximately 120,000 to 130,000 yuan. It is nominally intended to facilitate travel for both Chinese and foreign travelers and to implement commercialization. However, due to the manipulation of the Japanese Army Headquarters, ordinary passengers feel inconvenienced, and Chinese who have a little patriotism also avoid it. Therefore, since the company was established, the result of transforming from a military aviation team to a commercial aviation company has not yet been fully successful. The recent opening of the Tokyo-Tianjin air route and the simultaneous opening of the Pingjin-Beidaihe sightseeing air route have their own intentions. On the one hand, they want to attract tourists and develop business, and on the other hand, they want to make up for the losses. However, Beidaihe is our territory and has fallen into the puppet Hebei-Chahar area. Huitong Airlines directly opened the air route, completely disregarding our existence. (14th)</p>
<h3>Progress of the Nanjing Municipal Relief Institute</h3>
<p>Expenses Increase Annually, Facilities Improved</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: Since Mayor Ma's arrival, he has paid great attention to relief efforts. The progress of the Municipal Relief Institute in recent years is described below:</p>
<p>㊀ Expenses: The institute's budget for the 13th year of the Republic (1924) was 167,484 yuan, with actual monthly expenditure of 11,987 yuan. Subsequently, due to an increase in the number of residents, an additional 3,500 yuan was requested. The budget for the 24th year (1935) was 225,120 yuan, with actual monthly expenditure of 16,887 yuan. Starting in October of that year and continuing until the end of the year, additional funds were allocated for refugees, totaling 16,428.92 yuan. The budget for the 25th year (1936) was 379,940 yuan (including the estimated cost of housing 40 refugees), with actual monthly expenditure of 14,010 yuan.</p>
<p>㊁ Number of Residents: The highest number of residents in the 23rd year (1934) was 2,982. The highest number in the 24th year (1935) was 4,581. The highest number in the 25th year (1936) was 5,020.</p>
<p>㊂ Training and Education: In previous years, the institute focused on providing shelter and did not pay close attention to education and training. Since the 14th year (1925), it has been stipulated that education and training should go hand in hand. (A) Dengfu Mountain Primary School was established to educate orphaned children, with over 500 students currently enrolled. It has a kindergarten and classes for grades two, three, four, and five. (B) Military training is provided, with orphaned children organized into youth groups and women into nursing teams, all of whom are taught appropriate military knowledge. (C) Remedial education is provided, with apprentices learning crafts receiving remedial instruction in Party ideology, Chinese language, arithmetic, and other subjects. (D) A library has been established, purchasing books beneficial to the physical and mental well-being of children and adults, allowing residents to read at all times. (E) A women's domestic education class has been established, teaching women cooking, parental skills, and other subjects, and sending them to nurseries and the parent headquarters for practical experience in domestic work. (F) A family headquarters has been established, modeled after the Xiangshan Children's Home in Beiping, with children aged six to twelve forming family units of ten, led by a female resident of excellent character.</p>
<p>㊃ Improving the Organization: The institute's affiliated institutions include a nursery, an orphanage, a women's education center, two women's adoption branches, a disability center, a home for the elderly, a water rescue station, a first workshop, a second workshop, a printing factory, a brick kiln, and a sales office. The dispersed location and personnel organization were deemed unsound. In the 24th year (1935), the institute's organizational charter was revised and approved. The institute now has one director responsible for overall management, with five sections: documentation, accounting, general affairs, management, and handicrafts. Each section has one secretary and several assistants who carry out daily tasks under the director's instructions. Furthermore, the vagrant training center and the newly established refugee and beggar shelter were located far away in Ba Dou Shan. To adress this, the two institutions were merged to form a branch under the supervision of a director. Each of the other institutions is staffed by one secretary and several assistants to handle daily operations. Each workshop has a master craftsman in charge of production skills and education. The farm has one supervisor and one technician. The sales office has one secretary and one salesman. After the improvements, personnel responsibilities are clearly defined, and it is easier to advance the organization.</p>
<p>㊄ Expanding Crafts and Increasing Craft Production: In order to ensure the future independence of the residents, the institute is making every effort to strengthen production activities. Previously, the scale of the crafts was small, the products were simple, and the number of workers was 770. Starting in July of the 25th year (1936), the existing crafts were gradually expanded, and new departments for rattanware, wicker baskets, cloth bags, straw mats, mops, and woodworking were added, while training various craft technicians. The most outstanding residents were selected from each of the institutions, based on their aptitude, and assigned to work. This added 799 workers. The increase in craft production in the 25th year (1936) was as follows: The original towel department increased by 360 yuan per month, the stocking department increased by 160 yuan per month, the sewing department increased by 180 yuan per month, the knitting department increased by 160 yuan per month, the printing factory increased by 3,000 yuan per month, and the bamboo department increased by 400 yuan per month. The new crafts added the following increases: the rattanware department increased by 500 yuan per month, the cloth bag department increased by 180 yuan per month, the wicker basket department increased by 150 yuan per month, the straw mat department increased by 280 yuan per month, the woodworking department increased by 1,500 yuan per month, the soap department increased by 400 yuan per month, and the mop department increased by 160 yuan per month. The total increase in production from the original and newly added crafts was 7,530 yuan per month. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently supervising the institute to calculate and report the cost, sales, and profit of each type of production.</p>
<p>㊅ Improving the Nursery: The institute's nursery usually houses around 500 to 600 infants. The nursery provides both internal and external care. Due to space limitations, the internal care can only accommodate about 200 infants. The remaining 300 to 400 infants are breastfed by wet nurses outside the institute, which has unavoidable drawbacks. In order to improve this situation, a new nursery building is being planned, with the goal of accommodating at least 1,000 infants. Before the new building is constructed, the existing building will be planned to gradually take back the infants cared for outside the institute in stages. This is currently underway.</p>
<p>㊆ Establishing a Labor Corps: Since the vagrant training center began housing refugees last year, the number of women, children, disabled, and elderly people has exceeded 2,000. Only about 30% of the vagrants are strong. Except for a portion engaged in brick kiln crafts, 370 residents who were able to work were selected to form a labor corps, engaged in road construction, river dredging, and road building. The labor corps was assigned to projects such as building the dam at Erbanqiao, dredging the river at Huilongqiao, and demolishing the houses at the Chenggen military camp.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Copper and Iron Smuggled from Xiamen</h3>
<p>The Most Recent Smuggling Incident Involved 200,000 Kilograms</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Since the prices of copper and steel have soared, the smuggling of copper coins, scrap copper, and old iron from southern Fujian has become increasingly rampant. Although customs and coastal waterways have repeatedly made seizures, smugglers have not been deterred in the slightest. On the night of the 11th, another large batch of scrap copper and old iron, amounting to 200,000 kilograms, was smuggled out. Loaded onto two fishing boats with holding tanks, they left the dock near the North Shipyard in Xiamen and sailed towards Kinmen. It is said that they were being transported to Hong Kong. Recently, foreigners in Hong Kong have been buying this scrap copper and old iron at high prices. If it can be shipped to Hong Kong from southern Fujian, the profit can be doubled. Unscrupulous merchants and ronin are rushing to take advantage of this. It is said that there is a secret organization that handles smuggling, entrusting the clothing stores along Siming North Road to buy up the materials, assemble them in large quantities, and then smuggle them out. Currently, a certain clothing store on Siming North Road still has a large quantity of scrap copper and old iron, intending to continue shipping it out on the next ship. Currently, each copper coin in southern Fujian can be exchanged for 300 small copper coins. In Hong Kong, however, over 100 small coins can be sold for one Hong Kong dollar. The face value of copper and iron has also soared by more than double. General construction in Xiamen and Tongquan has come to a standstill due to the rising prices of steel and iron. The destination for the copper and iron exports is Hong Kong and Taiwan, where they are mostly sold to a certain country. In the rural areas of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, there are many peddlers who specialize in collecting copper coins and scrap copper and iron. Those who collect in Xiamen are mostly clothing stores, and the clothing store business is largely dominated by nationals of a certain country. (May 14th)</p>

<p>Electricity User Representatives Go to the Capital</p>
<p>The electricity price dispute in this county has dragged on for a month, with no resolution. All users convened a general meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on the 15th. During the meeting, users expressed their anger at County Magistrate Cao's perfunctory mediation and refused to accept it. They elected Sun Shiheng, Sun Zongkun, Shen Shuwen, Zhu Yian, and Jiang Xuezhu as representatives to go to the capital to present their case and petition the Central Construction Committee. The five representatives set off by train on the 16th and are expected to return to Songjiang on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Bizarre Case of Poisoning</p>
<p>Tu Yongkang, a live-in son-in-law of Sun Shaotang, who resides at No. 4, Jia 7, Bao 11, Yanzhong County, in the city, returned home from Shanghai on the 10th. The next day, after dinner, Mao Ciqing, a liaison officer from the First District Office, came to visit. He seemed displeased. He went to the room, took out a packet of powdered medicine, divided it into glutinous rice tubes, and swallowed ten of them. Mao asked about its effect, and he replied that it was a holy medicine for stomach ailments. He immediately gave Mao one tube and told him to swallow it with boiled water. Unexpectedly, Wang intended to commit suicide. The medicine he took was a poison called mercury chloride. Shortly after Mao left, Wang's poisoning took effect, his skin turned black, and his flesh wasted away. He died on the 12th. Wang's mother-in-law, seeing the enormity of the disaster, suddenly went to Shanghai. That night, she went to Taicang with Yang Shuzhang, a friend of Wang's before his death. As soon as they arrived at the door of the house, she grabbed Yang, shouting that he had forced her son-in-law to his death. Yang, seeing this situation, was terrified and tried to escape, but was seized by the crowd and beaten severely. Fortunately, the police arrived and took Yang to the station, where he was detained overnight. The next morning, Sun Yuying, the wife of the deceased, was summoned for preliminary interrogation. Unexpectedly, Wang's mother changed her mind and did not want to pursue the matter officially, intending to have Yang pay 200 yuan to settle the matter. After the preliminary interrogation by the police, the case was sent to the county government because it involved a human life. The court hearing opened at 3:00 PM. According to Sun Yuying, Yang Shuzhang had forced her husband to his death by demanding repayment of a debt in Shanghai. She requested that the case be handled seriously, saying, "My husband's death was so tragic. Please waive the autopsy." According to Yang Shuzhang, he had met Wang Yongkang on the 20th of March at the 16th Pier in Shanghai and demanded repayment of 40 yuan that he owed him. He did not know how he returned home and took poison. He only heard passersby say that it was caused by a quarrel between husband and wife. After the magistrate finished questioning, he took the coroner and others to the deceased's house for an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the deceased had indeed died from taking poison before his death. The magistrate immediately returned to the government office and ordered Yang to post bail for further investigation of the body and instructed the family to prepare the body for burial. After Mao Ciqing swallowed the mercury chloride, his skin turned dark, his figure became thin and emaciated, and he could not urinate or defecate. His family repeatedly made a fuss at Wang's house and involved ambiguous circumstances. Because the local doctors could not save him, he was sent to Shanghai by car yesterday afternoon for treatment.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Requesting Provincial Subsidies for Police Expenses</p>
<p>The county is implementing a police precinct system, which has increased expenses. Actual expenditure for the 25th year (1936) was 150,000 yuan, an increase of over 90,000 yuan compared to the past. The budget for the 26th year (1937) is estimated at 153,200 yuan. The Finance Office, believing that the people's resources are insufficient, convened a meeting of leaders from various agencies and organizations in Xincun and decided to jointly request the provincial government to allocate funds to subsidize, in order to lighten the local burden.</p>
<p>County-Wide Sanitation Campaign</p>
<p>The county-wide sanitation campaign was held at the sports field at 8:00 AM on the 15th. Over 1,000 people participated, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. In the afternoon, groups were organized to sweep the streets and conduct publicity and inspection. Various agencies, organizations, and schools implemented internal cleaning campaigns.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Wine Jugs Exempt from Inspection</p>
<p>The county government informed the local wine merchants that the wine jugs used in this county, which are traditionally divided into four sizes: half a jin, one jin, one and a half jin, and two jin, are measuring instruments and should be inspected and replaced with new ones. Otherwise, they would be confiscated after the Dragon Boat Festival. The merchants claimed that the losses would be enormous and specially petitioned the county government to stop this. They argued that wine jugs are a type of container, and the quantity is measured separately. In order to avoid misunderstandings, they requested that the names of the wine jugs be changed to "Tai," "Da," "Zhong," and "Xiao" (meaning "Extra Large," "Large," "Medium," and "Small") and filed for record. They argued that if containers must be inspected, then cooking pots and rice sacks should also be inspected. After receiving the petition, the county government instructed the association to submit four samples to the county government first.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Dispute Over the Xishan Coal Mine</p>
<p>The Chengjin Coal Mine on Xishan Mountain in Dongting, Suzhou, has been losing money for years. Therefore, it was leased to the Limin Company for mining last year. Unexpectedly, Limin recently obtained a mining license from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and revoked the Chengjin mining license at the same time. As a result, Luo Ganchang, the owner of the Chengjin Mine, felt aggrieved and specially submitted a petition to the Wu County Government, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating the details and requesting relief. After receiving the petition, the county government not only issued a notice but also forwarded it to the provincial government for review on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Lawyer Accused of Grave Robbing</p>
<p>Zhang Tong, a lawyer residing in Mianhua Lane outside the West Gate, was recently accused by Liu Jiangshi, the wife of Liu Adong, of stealing from the ancestral graves in Shuigoutou. The court has held several hearings, but the case has not been resolved. Lu Qingfu, the prosecutor in charge of the case, led intern prosecutor Fan Xuening, Central Political School intern Huang Jingwen, clerk Li Shihong, judicial police chief Zhu Wan Yuan, and bailiffs to Shuigoutou on the morning of the 16th to conduct an on-site inspection. The third police station in charge of the area also sent eight police officers to maintain order. Because this case has attracted a lot of attention from various sectors in the western district, there were no fewer than several thousand spectators at the time. After inspecting the site, the prosecutor found two coffins on the east side. There were bricks and lime left next to the coffins. He ordered the police to excavate at the location pointed out by the plaintiff and found the remaining bones. He then returned to the court to report and await review.</p>

<p>Pu Yicheng, a special commissioner from the County Farmers' Association, stated that the county's production of silkworm orchids is the highest in the province and is of great importance to the national economy. The spring orchids will soon be on the market. He feared that some cocoon merchants would not consider the farmers' costs and would manipulate the market, deliberately lowering orchid prices and shortening the opening season, causing farmers to suffer heavy losses and leading to other problems. Yesterday, based on the facts, he sent a letter to the sericulture model area, universally designating the orchid shops that handle the orchids of each orchid-growing household, so that farmers could wait for a better price and avoid disputes.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Construction Begins on Zhongshan Wharf</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang Provincial Construction Engineering Office, in order to facilitate water and land transportation in this port, has formulated a port plan, is implementing it accordingly, and has decided to build the Zhongshan Wharf. Previously, bids were invited, and the contract was awarded to the Kailin and Yu Haiji construction companies. It is reported that the merchants began work yesterday, building a temporary railway to transport soil from the north city wall to the north of Ganlu Port for the land filling project. After the land filling is completed, reinforced concrete construction will begin.</p>
<p>Dredging the Shallow Sections of the Canal</p>
<p>The Construction Department stated that the Jiangbei Canal, which connects Huaiyin in the north and joins the Yangtze River at Guazhou in the south, receives water from the Huai and Si rivers for irrigation and navigation. However, the section north of Shaobo, from the boundary to Mapengwan, is severely curved and shallow, and there is often a danger of water depletion. Since the Shaobo lock was built, there has been a water storage machine to maintain a certain water level above the lock, preventing the problem. However, the water flow from the section that can already store water in the north to the Guazhou section is not smooth, and the accumulation of silt has raised the riverbed, obstructing ship traffic. Therefore, the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau was ordered to send dredges and lead the Huai River Committee, which has also sent boats to assist. The work is expected to take eight months to complete.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Currency Trade Organization Prepares a Reserve Fund</p>
<p>The currency trade in Yin County is very developed, with large investments in Shanghai and Hangzhou. Since the financial crisis, each store has adopted a cautious approach to business, resulting in a surplus last year. At the regular meeting of the Currency Trade Association on the 14th, it was decided to establish a joint reserve fund. Da Tong Bank will provide withdrawals to be stored in the reserve. The regulations for the reserve fund are still being revised and will be implemented after being approved by the members.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Red Pill Drug Den</p>
<p>Someone informed the Public Security Fourth Branch on the north bank of the Jiangbei River that someone was selling red pills at No. 171 Zhongma Road. A patrol officer led police to investigate and seized five large packages of red pills, totaling over 2,000 pills. Xiang Xu, a woman from Zhenhai, her mother Zhu, and Xiang Daosheng were arrested and sent to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Arrival Situation</p>
<p>The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai around 3:00 PM, but was delayed until 4:15 PM due to tidal conditions. It docked at the Wayside Wharf in Yangshupu. After introductions by Mr. Huajia, Mr. Errázuriz and others exchanged greetings with the welcoming personnel in the ship's lounge and then boarded cars to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund to rest.</p>
<p>List of Delegation Members</p>
<p>The delegation's organization is based on the diplomatic corps system, including one ambassador-level leader, four minister-level members, three counselor-level members, and two secretary-level members. The list includes ㊀ Mr. Irarrazaval, currently a senator, appointed as the delegation leader with the rank of ambassador, accompanied by his son Eduardo. ㊁ Mr. Figueroa, currently a senator, traveling with his family. ㊂ Mr. García-Huidobro, currently the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Commerce of Chile, traveling with his family. ㊃ Mr. Valenzuela, currently the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance of Chile, accompanied by his mother. ㊄ Mr. Muller, currently the chairman of the Sociedad de Fomento Fabril (Chilean Industrial Development Society). ㊅ Mr. Goytia, currently the Director of the Tax Collection Bureau, traveling with his family. ㊆ Mr. Serrano Palma, currently the General Manager of the Chilean Nitrate Company, traveling with his family. ㊇ Mr. Barra, currently the Commercial Counselor at the Chilean Embassy in Japan, traveling with his family. ㊈ Mr. Cuadros, currently a Commercial Attaché at the Chilean Embassy in Japan.

On behalf of my delegation, I express our great pleasure and interest in the ancient culture of your country and its people. Upon the request of your government, as communicated by Mr. Zhang Qian, the minister of your country stationed in Santiago (the capital of Chile), we sincerely hope to promote friendship and understanding between our two countries. Therefore, our government has selected representatives from political and commercial circles to form our delegation to visit China. I am deeply honored to be appointed as the ambassador to lead our delegation. Some of the members, such as Mr. Figueroa, are also members of the Senate, like myself. Mr. García-Huidobro and Mr. Valenzuela are Undersecretaries of the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Finance. The rest are senior administrative officials and well-known figures in the business community. There are no major issues between China and Chile that could cause any disputes. However, there are some minor items in the trade relationship between the two countries that need to be discussed with your government and economic circles. We firmly believe that we will engage in discussions with a spirit of goodwill and without prejudice. We also hope to achieve complete success with the utmost sincerity and in a spirit of equality, so as to promote the interests of both countries and establish a new foundation for close relations between the two countries."</p>
<p>Answering Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>When asked by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency about the delegation establishing a Japan-Chile trade agreement in Japan, Mr. Irarrazaval replied that the delegation did not sign any agreement during their stay in Japan. However, some decisions were made regarding trade between Japan and Chile. The rumor of an agreement is likely a misunderstanding. The results of their stay in Japan can be considered satisfactory. He hoped that their visit to China would yield even more satisfactory results. Mr. Irarrazaval also mentioned that the delegation's stay in China would last about two weeks and that they would not specifically visit so-called "Manchukuo." However, after completing their inspections, some members would return home directly through Japan, while others would travel through Northeast China, the Soviet Union, and Europe, crossing over to the Americas. Trade between China and Chile has not been very developed in the past. Chile's exports to China were mainly nitrates, while China's exports to Chile were mainly rice and tea.</p>
<p>Departing for Hangzhou This Morning</p>
<p>The delegation's itinerary in China was reported in yesterday's newspaper. They are scheduled to depart for Hangzhou by car at 8:00 AM this morning for a day of sightseeing and visits. They will return to Shanghai tomorrow evening to conduct inspections and visit major factories. On the evening of the 21st, they will travel to the capital by car to pay their respects to the government authorities and then travel to Pingjin.</p>
<h3>Six Overseas Chinese from Siam Return to China for Sightseeing</h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday, Going to the Capital Today</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that Chen Wentian (native of Guangdong), an Overseas Chinese from Siam, is the Executive Committee Member of the Fifth Branch of the Kuomintang in Siam, and concurrently a consultant to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the National Government, the President of the Freedom Daily in Bangkok, Siam, and the Principal of the Huanghun School in Siam. He is always concerned about everything related to the motherland. In 1931, he led dozens of Overseas Chinese to organize an educational sightseeing tour back to China. He arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Those who came with him were Chen's secretary Zhuang Shihong, Chen Yougang (Executive Committee Member of the Kuomintang Branch in Chiang Mai, Siam), Chen Hongjie (Overseas Chinese merchant), and Chen's son Tawei and daughter Liying. Chen and other Overseas Chinese educators departed from Bangkok, Siam, last month, arriving in Shantou first, and then transferring to the China Merchants Haiyuan ship to Shanghai. They arrived in port on the afternoon of the 15th and stayed at Room 515 of the New Asia Hotel. A reporter visited them yesterday afternoon. Chen Wentian told the reporter that the newspaper business founded by Overseas Chinese in Siam is still quite developed, with more than ten newspapers such as the Overseas Chinese Daily, the Chinese Daily, the Bangkok Daily, the Siam Daily, and the Freedom Daily, with considerable circulation. As for the Overseas Chinese in Siam, there are currently about 3 million, most of whom are engaged in commerce, followed by agriculture. In terms of education, the local authorities treat the schools run by Overseas Chinese in Siam better than before, so Overseas Chinese education is more developed than before. Going to the Capital Today Chen and others are scheduled to take the early express train to the capital at 8:00 AM this morning to pay their respects to the central authorities and visit various construction projects. They will stay for about ten days and then return to Shanghai, and then travel to Qingdao, Jinan, Pingjin, and Suzhou and Hangzhou for visits. When returning to Siam, they will also travel to Guangdong for sightseeing.</p>

<h3>Xu Guqing's Coffin Was Transported to Beijing Last Night</h3>

The funeral committee moved Mr. Xu's coffin from the Chinese Funeral Home to the North Station at 1 PM yesterday. The procession was led by the band of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, followed by a car carrying Mr. Xu's portrait, and then the hearse. Behind that were the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau band, a platoon of military police from the Garrison Headquarters, and finally, the funeral committee members, Mr. Xu's relatives and friends, and family vehicles who were participating in the funeral procession. The procession was simple and solemn. The evening train transported the coffin to Beijing.

<h3>Fish Market Fish Vendors Resumed Business Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Thirteen Conditions Proposed Will Be Resolved Through Consultation</p>
<p>After the fish vendors in the Industry Department's fish market went on strike the day before yesterday demanding the cancellation of the 1.5% broker's commission, Chairman Du Yuesheng and General Manager Wang Xiaolai persuaded the fish vendors to resume business first and wait for a resolution. Regarding the thirteen conditions put forward and the cancellation of the broker's commission, they agreed to consult with the brokers and then submit a request to the Industry Department for instructions. The fish vendors expressed their acceptance and announced the resumption of business. At 1 AM yesterday, all fish vendors traded at the market as usual and used trucks to transport the fish to various small vegetable markets throughout the city for sale. The police bureau dispatched a large number of police officers to protect the fish vendors' resumption of business. Yesterday's market trading was particularly prosperous due to the peak season for large yellow croaker. At the same time, the market council has reported the handling of the fish vendors' strike to the Industry Department for review.</p>
<h3>Salted Fish Industry Petitions the Executive Yuan to Maintain the Original Tax Rate of the New Salt Law</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Amendments Increased the Rate by More Than Double. Once Implemented, the People Will Not Be Able to Bear the Burden</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, after the promulgation of the new salt tax law, the Ministry of Finance believed that the national tax revenue might suddenly decrease. Therefore, it consulted the Legislative Yuan to amend Articles 24 and 25, changing kilograms to market catties. The Salted Fish Industry Association of this city believes that the fishing salt and edible salt are of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Yesterday, it specially petitioned the Executive Yuan to request the maintenance of the tax rate of the new salt law. The original petition is recorded as follows: Petition for Maintaining the Tax Rate of the New Salt Law to Relieve the People's Hardships. This association recently saw reports that the new salt law is about to be amended, and the original tax rate will be increased, changing kilograms to market catties. The edible salt tax rate will be 5 yuan per 100 market catties, and the fishing salt tax rate will be 20 cents per 100 market catties. Reading this, we are extremely fearful. Edible salt is related to the entire national economy and the people's livelihood, while fishing salt is related to the livelihoods of millions of fishermen. At a time when the national rural economy is bankrupt, industry and commerce are declining, and the economy is deteriorating, it is too late to reduce the burden, how can we consider increasing it again? Once the above-mentioned amendment to the salt law is implemented, the difference with the tax rate of the new salt law will be more than double. The central government has considered the overall fiscal budget to make this drastic policy, but the whole country cannot bear the burden. The central government must also be aware of this. This association is closely related to this matter and cannot ignore it. Therefore, we sincerely appeal to your Yuan and Ministry to sympathize with the people's hardships and unanimously advocate maintaining the tax rate promulgated on May 30, 1931, with edible salt taxed at 5 yuan per 100 kilograms and fishing salt taxed at 20 cents per 100 kilograms. We sincerely request the central government to find other ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure to alleviate the hardships of the people of the whole country.</p>
<h3>Record of Contemporary People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>The French Ambassador to China, Nadjiar, took the night express train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<p>The Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, Zeng Zhongming, took the Shanghai-Pinghu train to Beijing at 12 PM last night.</p>
<p>The Director of the Department of Health, Liu Ruiheng, took the night express train out of Beijing last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Zeng Zhongming Hosted a Banquet for the French Ambassador Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, Zeng Zhongming, hosted a banquet for the French Ambassador Nadjiar and his secretary, Mr. Bo, at his residence on Anhe Temple Road yesterday (the 16th).

<h3>The City Museum Revised Its Opening Hours</h3>
<p>Exhibitions Will Continue as Usual on Tuesdays</p>
<p>The City Museum officially opened in January this year, which has won wide support from society. The museum originally decided not to close on memorial days and Sundays so that people could visit during their free time, and instead close on Tuesdays to allow staff to rest. Since the implementation of this system, it has been difficult to make it a habit. It is reported that many people come to the museum on Tuesdays to ask for special openings, which makes the museum feel embarrassed to refuse. Recently, the museum submitted a request to the municipal government, which has now been approved to be open all year round, with normal openings on Tuesdays. The China General Omnibus Company will also resume selling joint tickets from Tuesday.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Sericulture Improvement Association's Seed Production Site Temporarily Suspends Expansion</h3>
<p>Silk Seeds Exceed Demand to Avoid Losses</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Jiangsu Sericulture Improvement and Management Committee has issued a notice that all old seed production sites in the province will temporarily suspend expansion or applications for establishment to avoid losses, because the production and sales of silk seeds in the province are unbalanced. The notice states that the province's various spring silkworm rearing sites have previously been instructed by the Provincial Silkworm and Silk Experiment Site to collect silkworm eggs according to the approved amount. However, it is estimated that the number of seeds produced by each site will exceed the needs of the province, and neighboring provinces are implementing self-sufficiency plans for silk seeds, resulting in an imbalance in the production and sales of silk seeds in the province. Therefore, the meeting designated relevant committee members to discuss the province's silk seed production and sales issues to provide reference for the association's administration. Subsequently, on May 1st, the second item of the discussion, whether to notify the temporary suspension of the expansion of equipment and increase the amount of silkworm eggs in each old seed site this year, and those who apply for the establishment of new seed sites, was resolved to temporarily suspend the expansion of old sites and the application for the establishment of new sites. The decision has been signed and approved by the Construction Department for implementation. In addition to issuing separate orders, it is hereby notified to all old seed production sites in the province and those who are interested in creating and manufacturing silk seeds that, from now on, all applications for expansion or new establishments will be temporarily suspended to adjust production and sales and avoid losses.</p>
<h3>Various Circles' Sichuan Disaster Relief Association Repeatedly Receives Disaster Reports from Various Counties</h3>
<p>Board of Directors Meeting to Be Held Today; Business Fundraising by the Joint Association</p>
<p>The Sichuan Disaster Relief Association of this city received telegrams yesterday from Bishan, Fuling, Fushun, Hechuan, Zizhong, and other counties, reporting on the recent disaster situation. The telegrams stated that there has been no rain in Sichuan, and most of the fields are cracked due to the drought. Although there are oxen and plows, it is difficult to cultivate and plant. The time for planting is imminent. In addition, the average harvest of the spring crop is only 10%. Farmers are worried about food shortages and fear that planting will be hopeless. In this terrible year, the economy is extremely difficult. Yellow grain sells for more than 18 yuan per stone, white rice is 3 yuan 80 cents per dou, wheat is 3 yuan per dou, and broad beans are 3 yuan 50 cents per dou. Other grains, such as peas, sorghum, and peanuts, have also risen in price by 30-40%. Poor people cannot afford to buy them and can only endure hunger. However, people are not grass and cannot just sit and die. Therefore, kind people often carry jars and baskets to beg for food everywhere. Cunning people hold guns and become bandits to plunder for a living. In recent months, not only have there been numerous deaths from starvation every day, but also theft and robbery cases have emerged one after another. It is hoped that your association will appeal to all parties to quickly raise large amounts of disaster relief funds. It is understood that the association believes that disaster relief in the disaster area is urgent. Therefore, it is scheduled to hold the second joint meeting of the board of directors at the Hong Kong Road Bankers Association at 4 PM today to discuss fundraising and distribution methods.</p>

<p>The Yangtze River National Goods Inspection Group organized by the National Goods Movement United Association of this city is divided into upper and lower reaches groups. The association invited committee members and leaders of various domestic goods factories to hold a discussion meeting to review the scope of the inspection and the matters to be prepared, in order to increase the benefits of the inspection. The lower reaches group was originally scheduled to depart yesterday, but Ms. Lin Keting's affairs in Shanghai are still being handled, or someone is being asked to act as an agent, so the departure has been postponed. However, Ms. Lu Caihua of the upper reaches group has scheduled to depart on the 22nd of this month and go directly to Sichuan.</p>

It is understood that the association has sent letters to various district citizens' federations, domestic goods organizations, trade associations, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, and local associations to hold a joint meeting of representatives of various organizations on the 20th of this month (Thursday) to discuss the establishment of a "Movement to Not Sell Smuggled Goods Committee" and to discuss various regulations on not selling smuggled goods, reporting, and sanctions.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Foreign Trade Continued to Increase in April This Year</h3>
<p>Exports Were 38,849,162 Yuan; Imports Were 69,928,920 Yuan; Trade Deficit Was 31,079,758 Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Shenzhou News Agency, the Jianghai Customs announced yesterday the statistics of Shanghai's foreign trade in April this year. Both import and export figures continued to increase, with a trade deficit of 31,079,758 yuan, which was less than in March. The increase in import figures in April was mainly due to the high prices of goods in the world. The situation of our foreign trade is indeed gradually improving. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Overview of Foreign Trade</p>
<p>In April this year, the total value of Shanghai's foreign trade was 69,928,920 yuan for imports, an increase of 1,731,378 yuan compared with March, and an increase of 16,922,994 yuan compared with the same period last year. The total value of exports was 38,849,162 yuan, an increase of 4,382,679 yuan compared with March, and an increase of 13,228,099 yuan compared with the same period last year. The total value of import and export trade was 108,778,082 yuan, an increase of 6,114,057 yuan compared with March, and an increase of 30,151,093 yuan compared with the same period last year. Compared with exports and imports, the trade deficit was 31,079,758 yuan, a decrease of 2,651,301 yuan compared with March, and an increase of 3,694,715 yuan compared with the same period last year. The increase in both exports and imports in April is a symbol of the prosperity of foreign trade. The increase in imports is due to the high prices of goods, so the increase in quantity is not significant. Although the trade deficit was less than in March, it was slightly higher than in the same period last year. The reason for the increase is not because of the decrease in China's exports in April, but because of the increase in import figures (unit: national currency).</p>

<h3>Qian Chengxu's Report</h3>
<p>Investigating the Economic Situation in Shandong</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Qian Chengxu, a member of the Economic Construction Committee, was invited by the Shandong Provincial Government to provide consultation on the development of the province's industry and economy. Mr. Qian is currently in Jinan, writing a report on his findings and making recommendations to the provincial government. He also summarized the report and sent it to the Xinsheng News Agency reporter, saying that Shandong's products are mainly cotton, wheat, tobacco, peanuts, and coal. First, let's talk about tobacco. The tobacco-producing areas of Shandong are Linzi, Guangrao, Yidu, Linqu, Changle, Shouguang, Tanxian, and Anqiu, a total of 56 districts, covering 300,000 mu. In recent years, planting has been greatly improved, so the seedling length has reached 1.25 meters, and the leaves are also 8.3 inches long. The best land produces 400 pounds of leaves per mu. Now, the total output of Shandong Province is estimated to be more than 80.05 million pounds. Calculated at an average minimum selling price of 4.4 cents per pound, the total value is 12,460,000 yuan in national currency. The figures are astonishing. However, the biggest shortcomings are that the tobacco areas are scattered, and it is difficult to gather for tobacco baking during the harvest period. Therefore, tobacco farmers still use the old methods, using local products for local baking, and the quality is particularly affected. Without re-baking by machines, it cannot be stored for a long time. As for the sales situation, every year when tobacco leaves are on the market, merchants and companies from other ports come to Shandong to set up shops near railway stations along the railway line to purchase. At that time, tobacco farmers also gathered at the site, and each took turns according to the number on the receipt issued by the Public Security Bureau or the local Chamber of Commerce, sending the tobacco leaves to the merchant company's receiving place for inspection, weighing, and transaction. Then, they went to the accounting room to receive the money. However, farmers have no right to ask about prices and grading. Although farmers are the owners of the goods, everything is decided by the merchants and companies. In addition, I think that Shandong tobacco leaves are controlled by the two major British and American companies. Chinese tobacco factories and companies, such as Huacheng and Nanyang, also buy at that time, but in terms of status, they still follow the lead of foreign merchants. The reason is that British and American companies started their relationship with Shandong's industry earlier, and their economic strength is stronger than that of Chinese factories. They have deep roots and various conditions that create their special sphere of influence, which cannot be remedied overnight. In addition, the production situation of tobacco farmers is extremely difficult. Most farmers are poor, and the cost of purchasing tobacco seedlings, fertilizers, cultivating labor, and fuel for baking tobacco is 40 yuan per mu, but they lack cash and have to borrow money. Therefore, some unscrupulous merchants take the opportunity to provide fertilizer to tobacco farmers, raising the price of goods on the one hand and raising interest rates on the other, exploiting farmers in two ways. This is similar to the situation of unscrupulous merchants at sea today who lend rice to poor food households. This situation is the same everywhere, not just in Shandong. Zhang Honglie, the director of the Shandong Construction Department, has spared no effort in rural construction over the years. At the same time, with the assistance of Wang Yangxian, the manager of the Bank of China in Qingdao, and Chen Gao, the manager in Jinan, loans were made to rural areas, and hundreds of cotton industry cooperatives were established successively. This year's forecast for improved cotton seed production is at least 60,000 dan. Therefore, the Shandong Provincial Government is now planning to improve the tobacco industry in the province by establishing a large number of cooperatives in accordance with the cotton industry reorganization method. The various adverse situations can be resolved in the short term. At this point, we deeply feel that the economic relationship between Shandong and Shanghai is that one is the source of raw materials and the other is the market for consumption. They are interdependent. It is difficult to achieve the goal of China's overall national economic construction without organized cooperation. Shandong is already planning to organize an industrial company to take on this greatest task and mission.</p>

<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Q: Mr. Yi-ming Shi from Nanjing asks: I plan to purchase goods worth approximately 100 pounds sterling from a company in London, England. I would like to remit a deposit of about 10 pounds sterling first, and pay the remaining balance upon arrival of the goods. I would like to know the procedure. Are there any prohibited items for mailing, whether domestically or internationally? Please provide a list of all prohibited items.</p>
<p>A: It is not necessary to remit the money in advance. You can handle it according to the "Collect on Delivery Parcel" method of the post office. That is, the selling company prepares the goods you ordered, packs them into a parcel, obtains a special form from the local post office, fills in the value of the parcel and other details, and sends it to the post office for delivery. Upon arrival at the destination, the local post office will notify the recipient to prepare the payment and collect the parcel within the specified period. The collection period for parcels from England is 20 days, starting from the date of notification. For example, if the Nanjing Post Office receives a parcel addressed to you from London on May 1, 1937, noting that it contains a pair of leather shoes, the Nanjing Post Office should collect 1.5 pounds sterling from you. The Nanjing Post Office will notify you on the same day to prepare the payment and collect the parcel. After receiving the notification, you should bring the equivalent of 1.5 pounds sterling in domestic currency to the post office before May 30 to collect it. If you fail to collect it within the deadline, unless the sender has clearly indicated on the parcel or related documents that it cannot be delivered and should be redirected to a specific person in China or similar wording, the post office can handle it accordingly. Otherwise, it will be returned to the sender. For parcels collected on delivery between our country and England, the maximum amount that can be collected per parcel is 20 pounds sterling. If the goods you plan to purchase are worth about 100 pounds, you can ask the sender to divide them into several parcels, each with a value not exceeding 20 pounds. If the goods you plan to purchase are a single item that cannot be divided, then they cannot be sent as a collect-on-delivery parcel. If you want to remit money, you can send it by international money order. The post office has special forms for purchasing international money orders, which you can obtain at any time and fill out according to the instructions. For detailed procedures, please refer to the 7th "Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A." Prohibited items for mailing in the post office apply to both import and export parcels. A summary of the names of the various items is listed below: (1) Items whose nature and packaging methods are sufficient to contaminate postal items or harm postal staff; (2) Explosive, flammable, and other dangerous goods; (3) Live animals other than bees, silkworms, leeches, etc.; (4) Opium, morphine, cocaine, and other narcotics, unless permitted by the competent authority in accordance with the law; (5) Items related to obscenity and morality; (6) Items whose publication, sale, and manufacture are prohibited by the government; (7) Lottery tickets and advertising leaflets related to lottery tickets, except for lottery tickets specifically permitted by the government; (8) Any items that are prohibited or restricted from declaration by customs are also prohibited or restricted by the post office. In addition, items subject to customs duties that have not been taxed, and large quantities of samples intended to evade taxes.</p>
<h3>County Government Restricts Establishment of Public Cemeteries Along the Shanghai-Minhang Road</h3>

Now, the Shanghai County Government has found that there are many public cemeteries and burial mounds along the Shanghai-Minhang Road, with five places within the county alone. If these are not restricted, they will hinder local prosperity. Yesterday, in addition to ordering the various public cemeteries and burial mounds to restrict expansion, it was also forbidden to establish any more cemeteries along the highway in the future.</p>

<h3>Copper Cauldron Thief at Yong'an Cemetery Apprehended</h3>
<p>The Court Ordered Detention for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>The late mother of Central Committee Member Wang Boqun was buried in Yong'an Cemetery. Her son-in-law, Minister He of the Military Affairs Department, had a bronze cauldron weighing more than 100 pounds cast and erected in front of the tomb. At the end of the old lunar year last year, the bronze cauldron was suddenly stolen. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau immediately ordered the detective team to track down and arrest the thieves Li Tianyou (43 years old, from Huaiyin, living in Zhoujiaqiao, west of Shanghai), Wang Ziying (24 years old, from Jining, Shandong), and Wang Fengxiang (49 years old, from Shanyang, Jiangbei). They confessed to stealing the cauldron with Xue Baokui and others who are still at large, and to smashing the cauldron into pieces weighing approximately 102 pounds, which they sold to Hu Changle and Xu Shusheng from Jiangdu, who collected old goods, who then resold it to Zhang Pangrui of Renxin Copper and Tin Shop for money. They were all detained and handed over to the prosecutor of the local court for investigation. The collectors all claimed that they bought the goods as old goods and did not know they were stolen. However, the prosecutor argued that since Hu Changle and Xu Shusheng were in the business of collecting old goods, they should have suspected the source when a porter sold them more than 100 pounds of broken copper. They could not claim ignorance. Zhang Pangrui was a partner in a copper and tin shop and should have had some experience. The porter sold copper in bulk, which was obviously stolen goods. How could he not have known the situation? Therefore, Li Tianyou, Wang Ziying, Wang Fengxiang, and the fugitive Xue Baokui were prosecuted under Article 121, Paragraph 1, Item 4 of the Criminal Law, and Hu Changle, Xu Shusheng, and Zhang Pangrui were prosecuted under Article 349, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Wang Shanxiang. Because the three defendants who bought the stolen goods were evasive and hired lawyers to defend them, the court ordered them to be detained for further interrogation.</p>

After repeated trials, a continued hearing was held yesterday, and the court ordered the parties to reconcile outside of court.</p>
<h3>Famous Fortune Teller's House Robbed, Three Thieves Caught on the Spot</h3>
<p>The Victim's Son Climbed into Neighbor's House to Report the Crime, Detectives Arrived After Receiving the News and Intercepted the Thieves</p>
<p>Han Yongnian, a blind fortune teller from Ningbo, lives at No. 21, Lane 211, Dongyouheng Road. His career is prosperous and his house is luxuriously decorated with redwood furniture. It has recently been coveted by bandits. At 10:15 AM on the morning before, five bandits suddenly rushed in with fake guns, pointed the guns at the blind fortune teller and told him not to make a sound. They drove his wife and son, Dinghe, into a small room upstairs and told them not to step out of line. They began to search for valuables, but were unable to find any cash or legal tender. They were only able to steal a large package of clothes worth more than 100 yuan, including several woolen sweaters. The bandits put on the sweaters and fled. At this time, Han's son, Dinghe, took the opportunity to climb onto the sun deck and jump down from the top of the neighboring house at No. 23. He used the telephone to report the crime to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. Detective Shao Jingfan, together with detectives Yuan Xinzong and Wu Ruisheng, put on steel vests and drove to the scene to apprehend the bandits. Near Yalu Road, they saw Zhu Afa from Ningbo running west and intercepted him. The victim, Han Dinghe, arrived and identified him as a member of the gang. The new woolen sweater and shoes he was wearing were stolen goods. Later, they arrested two more accomplices, Zhang Amu and Chu Yongxing, also from Ningbo, along with a bag of clothes. The woolen sweaters worn by Zhang and Chu were also stolen goods. Except for a missing leather robe, everything was in the bag of clothes. The police chief ordered them to be detained and sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court the next morning. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Dayin, described the case in detail and stated that the masterminds were Huang A-quan and Zhou A-feng, who were still at large. He requested a postponement. According to the report of the Sino-Western detectives, the process of arresting the two defendants was described. After presenting the stolen goods for inspection, Judge Zhong Qing ordered them to be detained and interrogated again at a later date.</p>
<h3>Wusong Southwest Merchant Injured in Robbery</h3>
<p>Xu Feixiang Was Ignorant and Self-Serving, Resulting in Serious Injuries from the Thieves' Beating</p>
<p>Xu Feixiang, a 53-year-old farmer from Xujia Ban, Wusong Southwest Henghama, was suddenly attacked by eight or nine bandits in the middle of the night. They spoke in Jiangbei and Shandong accents and carried weapons such as handguns and wooden clubs. They broke into the house and tied up Xu, prohibiting him from making a sound. The other thieves then went to the rooms to rob. Xu, however, was ignorant and self-serving, and shouted for help, which caused the thieves to use wooden clubs to strike him on the head, left shoulder, and ribs in three places, causing serious injuries. Fortunately, passers-by happened to be passing by at a critical moment. The thieves heard the sound of people, suspected that the police had arrived, and fled in a clamor. Therefore, the losses were only a few dozen yuan of clothing and accessories. However, Feixiang's injuries were very dangerous. He immediately invited Jin Caizhang, a well-known trauma specialist from Wusong, to treat him. Because Jin had a wealth of experience, there was a significant turnaround yesterday, and his life may be saved.</p>

<h3>Rise in Toilet Paper Prices</h3>
<p>Public Toilet Contractors Ask the Municipal Council to Remove the "No Charge" Sign</p>
<p>According to Shenzhou News Agency, each public toilet in the Shanghai Public Concession has toilet paper for sale at the entrance, at a price of one copper coin per sheet. The Eastern Xingji Company bid and won the contract for 3,853 yuan last year. However, before the bidding, the Municipal Council agreed to remove the sign at the entrance of the toilet from March 1st after the bidding, which read "This is a men's public toilet. No charge for entry. Toilet paper costs one copper coin per sheet, but this item is not mandatory." Since the company won the bid, the Municipal Council has not fulfilled its promise, and the recent soaring prices of toilet paper have caused unsustainable losses. Therefore, the contractors jointly petitioned the Municipal Council, proposing three conditions: (1) Request to remove the "No Charge" sign; (2) Revise the price of toilet paper; (3) Request to reduce the bid price. If the above three requirements cannot be implemented, the contract for bidding will be canceled and a special commissioner will be hired to manage the matter. The Municipal Council has not yet responded. During the mass meeting of the Citizens' Federation the day before, the contractors also petitioned the Federation. The executive committee members said that the price of one copper coin per sheet of toilet paper was not low, and that this was related to the livelihood of the poor. If the price was raised rashly, it would affect the poor and a thorough investigation was necessary. It was resolved to investigate the case. If the contractor was indeed losing money and it was necessary to increase the price, the Federation would negotiate with the Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce to Close Discount Exhibition of Counterfeit Currency</h3>
<p>Closing on the 20th</p>
<p>Since the opening of the counterfeit currency exhibition held by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall, there has been a continuous stream of Chinese and foreign visitors every day, often reaching five or six hundred people. This is because currency matters are closely related to the interests of the public, so visitors have carefully observed each item. The exhibits have been well-arranged, with genuine and fake currencies displayed side-by-side, allowing viewers to compare them. The hall has also made provisions for employees of companies and firms who may not usually have the opportunity to visit. It was open as usual on Sunday. The association originally planned to close the exhibition on the 17th, but due to numerous requests from various industries for continued display, and because the hall's health exhibition also needed to be prepared, the exhibition was extended for a maximum of three days, and will close on the afternoon of the 20th, it is said.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Residents, Including Chen Kecheng, Request Reduction in Shanghai-Qingpu Bus Fares</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the long-distance bus service from Shanghai to Qingpu, the number of passengers traveling back and forth has been very high. From July 15th to the end of December last year, the net profit reached 13,000 yuan. In March and April of this year, the net profit was already more than 7,000 yuan. However, due to the high ticket prices, passengers feel burdened. Therefore, Qingpu natives in Shanghai, including Chen Kecheng, suggested that the company reduce ticket prices to ease the burden on passengers. The original letter stated that the purpose of building highways is to facilitate transportation and promote social prosperity. The fare from Shanghai to Songjiang, which is 45 kilometers long, is 70 cents. The fare from Shanghai to Jiading, which is 35 kilometers long, is 66 cents. Qingpu to Shanghai is only 23 kilometers, but the price is set at 90 cents, which is almost twice as high as the Shanghai-Songjiang fare. This is completely contrary to the original intention of the government in building highways. Therefore, in accordance with the current ticket prices for Shanghai-Songjiang and Shanghai-Wuxi, they jointly requested the company to reduce the fare to 65 cents for the entire route, and change the small chartered car to accommodate eight passengers, in order to benefit the public and show fairness.</p>

<h3>National Buddhist Community Disputes Buddha's Birthday</h3>
<p>A telegram from the Panchen Lama Causes an Uproar in the Buddhist Community, Organizing a Research Association to Discuss</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association received a letter from the Bodhi Society stating that it had received a telegram from the Panchen Lama requesting that April 15th be designated as the day of the commemoration of Sakyamuni Buddha, and requested the government to officially designate it as a Buddhist Memorial Day. After receiving the letter, the association sent letters to high-ranking monks and lay Buddhists across the country to solicit opinions. For a time, differing opinions abounded, causing a dispute in the Buddhist community. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Bodhi Society's Letter to the Buddhist Association</p>
<p>The Bodhi Society of this city sent a letter to the Chinese Buddhist Association, stating: "With respect, we recently received a telegram from the Panchen Lama stating that April 15th is the day of Sakyamuni Tathagata's enlightenment, and he intends to request the National Government to designate it as a memorial festival, and specially seeks the agreement of colleagues. However, according to local customs, April 8th is the responsibility of the Buddha's birth, and the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month is the day of the Buddha's enlightenment. There are also many disputes about the year, month, and day of the Buddha's birth. We dare not speculate whether it is feasible. We especially request your association to assess and reply in order to forward it to the Panchen Lama."</p>
<p>Buddhist Association Seeks Opinions from All Parties</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, the Chinese Buddhist Association sent letters to high-ranking monks and lay Buddhists across the country to solicit opinions. The letter stated: "The association has received a letter from the Bodhi Society (the text is recorded above). The association has consulted with the virtuous Kelunbo layman of Ceylon, who is residing in Shanghai, who stated that Ceylon, Myanmar, Siam, and European countries all use the full moon day in May as a memorial day. It was also submitted to the 10th meeting of the 8th session of the Standing Council of the Association for detailed discussion. It was resolved that there are different opinions regarding the date of the Buddha's enlightenment and birth, and the calendars used by various ethnic groups are also different. Now, with reference to the customs of Tibet, Ceylon, Myanmar, Siam, and European countries, it is proposed that the full moon day in May of the national calendar (corresponding to April 15th of the lunar calendar) be designated as World Buddhist Memorial Day. However, in our country, the eighth day of the fourth lunar month has been the day of the Buddha's birth for thousands of years, and the association dares not decide by a few people. Therefore, it is proposed to send letters to solicit the consent of all virtuous people, and then request the Panchen Lama to forward it to the National Government to issue an order for commemoration."</p>
<p>National Dispute Leads to the Formation of a Research Association</p>
<p>After the Chinese Buddhist Association sent letters to solicit opinions from various parties, it has now received replies with appended opinions. In terms of monks and nuns, there are more than ten people, including Yinguang and Taixu. In terms of lay Buddhists, there are more than ten people, including Wen Lanting, Ji Juemi, and Huang Hanzhi. The above people's claims can be divided into: 1. We should adhere to existing customs and not follow the claims of others; 2. We should uphold the meaning of the Panchen Lama's intent, and handle it as he proposed; 3. The existing memorial day should be maintained, and the Panchen Lama's proposal should also be agreed upon. It may be possible to set a new memorial day in addition to the original memorial day. After reviewing the opinions of all parties, the Buddhist Association believes that the matter is of great importance and requires further detailed and careful research. Therefore, in addition to forming a Buddha's Birthday Research Committee to review the opinions of all parties, it will also convene a meeting of all directors and supervisors to discuss and decide, and then present it to the National Government for official regulation and nationwide compliance.</p>
<h3>Korean Drug Traffickers Beat Police Officers</h3>
<p>The North Sichuan Road Police Station has been dispatching a large number of detectives to search for drug dealers in Qujiang Road, Wusong Road, Dekangli, Zixiangli, and Lanes 8 and 9, and Lanes 7 and 8 in the district. In the past three days, more than 100 people have been arrested and sent to the bureau for interrogation and punishment. The Korean ruffians who run the drug dens, seeing their business greatly affected, have been sending people to deliver drugs to anyone who goes to buy them. At around 11:00 AM yesterday, a police officer named Li, disguised in plainclothes, saw a person carrying drugs and followed them to Qujiang Branch Road. When he tried to make an arrest, he was suddenly surrounded and beaten by several Korean ruffians, causing serious injuries. The police officer on duty at No. 21 was shocked by the sight and stood there dumbfounded. Fortunately, a Boy Scout from Shanghai North High School bravely stepped forward to help, and the ruffians dispersed in a hubbub. One of the drug dealers was caught on the spot and taken back for questioning. Officer Li, who was severely injured in the beating, was sent to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, the Korean ruffians were daring enough to gather a crowd, wielding iron bars and other weapons wrapped in newspapers, and marched around the district, taking threatening action. The police station was heavily guarded, and no opportunity was given to take advantage of it, so no incidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Female Law Student Zhang Zhiying Dies from Poisoning</h3>
<p>Found with Foaming Blood in Mouth, Died Before Reaching Hospital</p>
<p>Zhang Zhiying, a 25-year-old female freshman law student from Jiashan, who was currently studying at the Shanghai Jiangwan Road Law School, was quiet and taciturn, and was commended by teachers and friends for her diligence. At around 7:00 PM last night, Zhang returned to school from her sister's house on Albert Road, Julai Road, and suddenly took two bottles of poison to commit suicide. It was not until around 8:00 PM that Niu, a female student from the same dormitory, returned to school with her sister and opened the door to the dormitory. They found Zhang foaming blood in her mouth and in a coma, and reported it to the dormitory supervisor, who telegraphed the police station and summoned an ambulance to rush her to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. By then, it was already 8:30 PM. Zhang died at around 9:00 PM due to taking too much poison, and the treatment was ineffective. Soon, her sister received the news, went to the hospital with her husband, and hired a car to send the body to the funeral parlor to await encoffining. Zhang has no family in Shanghai, and her parents have passed away. She only has one sister. According to the investigation, the reason for the poisoning was nothing more than a romantic problem.</p>
<h3>Catholic Church Observed Holy Day Yesterday</h3>

At 8:00 AM, Bishop Hui of the Jiangnan Province, wearing a red and gold liturgical garment, led five or six ranks of choir students in holding a chanting Mass. Then, the sacrament of confirmation was performed for more than a hundred male and female students and parishioners who received confirmation. Bishop Hui made the sign of the cross on the foreheads of each student in turn, and each student wore a strip of white cloth on their forehead, indicating that they were brave believers in the Holy Church. The ceremony ended at 11:00 AM. The French Consul General and the French Chief Inspector attended the church to recite scriptures and observe the ceremony, which was quite grand.</p>

<h3>Using Young Women as Bait to Swindle Brothels</h3>
<p>Escaping with Money After Obtaining It, Gong Gencheng is Detestable, Wang Cuizhen is Fooled</p>
<p>The art of deceiving in Shanghai is becoming more and more strange. Recently, there was another case of a rogue using a young woman as bait to swindle a brothel madam out of 100 yuan in legal tender. It turns out that a man from Suzhou named Long Gencheng was a peddler. Recently, due to extreme poverty, he had a fanciful idea and discussed with a Changzhou woman named Wu Cuizhen, who lived at No. 50 Guangxi Road, to defraud money. He instructed Ms. Wang to pretend to be Gong's adopted sister and volunteer to go to a brothel to engage in flesh peddling. After obtaining the dowry, they would run away. Wang Cuizhen, who is 22 years old and has some beauty, is a married woman with a three-year-old daughter. Recently, her husband returned to his hometown, and her daughter is ill, lacking medical funds and living in poverty. For a time, she was blinded by greed and rashly agreed. Therefore, on the 26th of last month, she entrusted Zhu Asi, a fellow villager living at No. 81 Baoxing Lane, Haining Road, to introduce her to Zhu Abao, a Suzhou woman who opened a brothel at No. 41 Shangchun Lane, North Sichuan Road, for a meeting. At that time, it was agreed that Wang Cuizhen would prostitute herself at Zhu Abao's place, and the dowry would be 125 yuan. In a week, Zhu Abao had paid the group 100 yuan in installments. Unexpectedly, after the payment, Wang Cuizhen ran away that afternoon and disappeared. Zhu Abao then negotiated with the introducer, Zhu Asi, and Asi issued an IOU as collateral, while tracking down Gong Gencheng's whereabouts. It was not until 4:00 PM the day before yesterday that they ran into Gong on Minthini Road in the French Concession. They argued and were arrested and taken to the French Concession Police Station.</p>
<p>Upon learning that the incident occurred in the Public Concession, they were transferred to the Hongkou Police Station. Under investigation by the detectives, Zhu Abao and Wang Cuizhen were arrested and detained separately. The prosecutor of the Special First Court, Jiang Baolian, charged Gong, Zhu, and Wang with fraud and obtaining property in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law. He also charged Zhu Abao with inducing a decent woman to engage in adultery for profit in accordance with Article 2.2 of the Obscenity Prevention Act, and stated the above situation. Interrogating Wang Cuizhen, she confessed, "Because of my difficult life, I was deceived by Gong Gencheng. After entering Zhu Abao's brothel, I was forced to grind mirrors. I didn't want to, so I changed to receiving guests. In a week, I received guests three times, and all the money I earned was taken away by the madam. Because I didn't want to fall into the fiery pit for a long time, I ran back. Gong gave me ten yuan." Gong Gencheng stammered in his confession, saying that all the money he obtained was given to Wang Cuizhen's mother, Zhu Asi. Zhu Abao also shirked responsibility. Judge Dai ordered the defendants to be detained pending a later date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Zhang San Dies on Sick Road</h3>
<p>Zhang Sanchuan, a 52-year-old man from Yancheng, Jiangbei, residing in a straw shed in Debao Lane, Guangzhao Road, Zhabei, usually sold rice straw and was obese. Yesterday (16th) at 11:00 AM, he carried a load of rice straw (about a hundred pounds) out of his house. As soon as he walked to the entrance of Hele Lane, about ten houses away from his home, he suddenly fell to the ground, and fresh blood flowed from his nose and mouth. He died instantly. After the police on duty saw this, they reported it to the police station, which instructed the local security chief to report it to the local court. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Lei and others arrived at the scene to examine the body and determined that he had died of a stroke and other diseases. They instructed the family to prepare a coffin for the burial.</p>
<h3>Fire at Fangxie Road</h3>
<p>At 7:00 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the Jinji Bamboo Shop and the Chen Shunxing Bamboo Shop warehouse, located in the southwest corner of the Municipal Sports Block at the intersection of Fangxie Road and Dalin Road in the south of Shanghai. Fire trucks from various districts rushed to the scene to put out the fire. As a result, two self-built bamboo fence rooms of the shop were burned down, with a loss of about 100 yuan. When the shop caught fire, the front and back doors were locked, and no one was staying there. The fire is currently being investigated by the police station in charge.</p>
<h3>Electric Tram Ticket Clerk Lu Jinsheng's Lawsuit of Gaining New and Forgetting Old</h3>

<p>Gong Xiuzhen, a 19-year-old young woman from Qingpu, residing at No. 67, Yujia Lane, Dananmen, eleven years ago, fell in love freely with Lu Jinsheng, a ticket seller from the electric tram company (currently 32 years old), and lived together. They had a son and a daughter, the son died young, and the daughter is still alive and is now eight years old. Lu recently fell in love with a young girl named Su Fen and welcomed her home to live with him. Although neither are married, they seem to have a happy family, but since then, jealousy has frequently caused disputes. On the 8th of this month, Gong Xiuzhen was slandered by Su Fen for playing mahjong, which made Lu very angry and accusing of wasting his hard-earned money for his family to gamble. Therefore, he beat her. The next day, Gong Xiuzhen made things difficult for Su Fen and was beaten again by Lu. Gong Xiuzhen, believing that Lu Jinsheng was gaining new and forgetting old, filed a lawsuit against Lu and Su Fen for injury in the local court. Yesterday, Judge Wu interrogated them, but because the defendant had not arrived, the interrogation was postponed to a later date.</p>

<h3>Shengsheng Hospital's General Fee Delivery Method</h3>
<p>Dr. Qu Shaoheng, the director of Shengsheng Hospital on Saposai Road in the French Concession, is an expert in obstetrics and gynecology with profound knowledge and extensive experience. His service to the community is based on sincerity. Ladies and gentlemen in Tianjin and Shanghai are well aware of this. In order to relieve poor pregnant women, the hospital has a method of free delivery, charging only 30 cents for meals per day. Recently, in response to opinions from all parties, in order to avoid the complicated payment of fees for pregnant women staying in the hospital and to facilitate budgeting, a general fee delivery method has been added (excluding those who voluntarily receive booster injections or take valuable medicines). The first class actually charges one hundred, the first class sixty yuan, and the third class ten yuan, including the cost of delivery, induced labor, difficult labor surgery, maternal food, and materials required during delivery. The method is simple and convenient and is considered suitable.</p>

<h3>Child Prodigies</h3>
<p>— Xiao Mei</p>
<p>We Chinese have always valued child prodigies, and it seems we have had quite a few. Some could write poetry at six, others could write essays at five, and so on. Now, another one has appeared, right before our eyes, discovered in Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to reports, this "child prodigy" is only four years and nine months old, but can read "as many as 45 kinds of books, totaling 641 volumes. He can recite clearly and without error even the more profound texts, such as the national language textbooks for upper primary school, the rules of the New Life Movement, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will." The results of the Binet-Simon test show that his intelligence has reached six years and three months, exceeding the standard by 18 months.</p>
<p>This discovery is truly remarkable and gratifying. But if one has children at home who are weak and dull, with intelligence lower than their actual age, what will they think? Will they blame heredity or the social environment that made them so?</p>
<p>Julian Huxley, in his article "Eugenics and Society," tells us that the various branches of humanity have the same origin. The differences that exist between them now are entirely due to the different objective environments that each branch has experienced during its development. Regarding all the hereditary nature of humans, especially in terms of intelligence, the actual differences between the branches are very small. Most of the intelligence and physical strength curves between them are in a state of overlap. If we harmonize the social environment to make it uniform, most of the existing differences will disappear without a trace. Therefore, although he admits the hereditary differences between races and classes, the real hereditary differences can be caused by environmental differences, and are often masked by environmental differences. Therefore, if we want to use hereditary differences as the basis for eugenics, the only way is to eliminate the environmental differences between various groups and make them live in the same environment. In his article, he also cites examples, saying, "The intellectual age of students in high-class schools in London is much higher than that of students in schools in nearby poor areas. The intellectual age of twelve-year-old students in the former is one year higher than their actual age, while the intellectual age of twelve-year-old students in the latter is on average one year lower than their actual age." And "recent research has already told us that vitamins and other additional food factors have a huge impact on physique and spirit that we dare not imagine."</p>
<p>In the case of the "child prodigy's" family, this is indeed the case: "His mother is a graduate of the old-style Normal School in the Three Eastern Provinces, and his father is a professor at a foreign university." In addition to so-called "heredity," the environment of the "child prodigy" is different from that of poor children.</p>
<p>Since we know that "real hereditary differences can be caused by environmental differences," we also know that the progress of the times depends on the strength of the entire population, and never relies on a few so-called "geniuses." Therefore, although we find it gratifying to have a "child prodigy," we must not forget that, according to the statistics published by the Health Education Committee a month ago, among the 9,000 students examined in this city (what a comparison between one and more than 9,000! And school-age children who cannot afford to go to school are not included), those with defects account for slightly less than 90%!</p>
<p>However, the discovery of this "child prodigy" can help us prove one thing, and that is to prove that the "racial superiority theory" shouted by the Hitlers is nonsense!</p>
<h3>From Taking Confessions with Sound Recording to a Silent China</h3>
<p>— Wu Cun</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Hong Fa's "Taking Confessions with a Gramophone," I cannot help but feel moved again. But my feelings are different, so I want to express a "dissenting opinion."</p>
<p>When fighting a lawsuit with someone, "the appellant used sound recording to make a record of the appellee's oral obscuring of the court's circumstances into a record... The gramophone was turned on in court, and the truth of the case was broadcast." This is indeed a new invention for litigation evidence. The voice is vividly present, making it impossible for the other party to deny it. But what I find interesting is that this broadcast not only broadcast "the truth of the case," but also broadcast the fact that winning or losing a lawsuit depends only on whether one is good at "obscuring" things.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Hong Fa believes that this invention will have a great impact, and in the future it may cause people to speak hesitantly, lest they say something wrong and leave a handle for others. Finally, he also advocated using this method to record the speeches of politicians in the opposition, so that when they come out of the mountains in the future, it can be used to compare their words and deeds. I think this is an overly honest view.</p>
<p>"A word once spoken cannot be overtaken by a team of four horses" is a very old saying. Which politician today is still patient enough to care whether their words and deeds match! The Tingtao Society once compiled and printed a book called "Words of the Carnivores." All the contents of the book are the speeches of the worthies of the time when they were in the opposition, allowing everyone to "listen to their words and observe their actions" to see how different they are before and after. But what is the use of this? Mr. Lu Xun pointed out at the time that this ancient method of "checking old accounts" is not applicable to today's world!</p>
<p>Isn't there a popular modern saying that goes, "All things before are like yesterday's death"? That was then, this is now. Today, they have taken the oath, sworn once, and turned over. They have already "been born today after all kinds of things" and become another kind of person.</p>
<p>You think, even articles written in black and white are not considered important, let alone the sound on a gramophone?</p>
<p>And recording "lofty remarks about saving the country" is simply superfluous. Which politician doesn't advocate saving the country? However, the way to save the country varies from time to time. In their view, they should "adopt the spirit of enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens."</p>
<p>The use of gramophones will be promoted with this invention in the future, which may be possible, but I think it will definitely not be in the sense that "common people can use it to take confessions." China's "common people" may not have such good things and wealth for a while. Sound recording costs money, and fighting a lawsuit requires even more wealth and means. I am afraid that Mr. Hong Fa's proposal will not be realized (this is certain), and on the contrary, it will be used on the heads of "common people." It is said that the government has the determination to open up freedom of speech, but ideological control must still be strictly implemented. If a gramophone is installed in every household in the streets and alleys to record sound every day, it would be a great way. — No matter what, once it comes to China, it will always be transformed into a tool for tidying up the "common people." This is not surprising.</p>
<p>By that time, "common people" will really not even be able to sigh, and will have to remain silent and become dumb. — The era of "silent China" is about to arrive.</p>
<h3>Wounded</h3>
<p>— Luo Xuan</p>
<p>As he walked down the high stone steps of Dada Hospital, his wrist was swollen with snow-white bandages, one arm hanging over his head; his face was yellow, and his feet descended the stone steps stiffly.</p>
<p>Before three o'clock, they were unloading a shipload of rice. Fine raindrops trickled down in the gray, leaden open space, covering the earth with a layer of moist felt.</p>
<p>The springboard changed color, imprinted with the footprints of many workers. Below, the river, shimmering with dazzling and dull light, added to the burden in people's hearts.</p>
<p>He slipped on the slope. His face was as pale as a piece of ice, and his scream was like a lost soul. A terrible descent.</p>
<p>Seeing that one hand was red and raw with the skin scraped off, the foreman said, "Take him to Dr. Ma's hospital to wrap it up." It was considered charity.</p>
<p>Now, he was walking alone, abandoned on the moist road, along the walls of the houses. He suddenly remembered a vague shadow of home.</p>
<p>He was not a foreigner, (his companions were all foreigners, soldiers.) He had a home: his father was a foreman in a transportation company; his mother, at home, led a light life, also playing mahjong, and the rest of the time quarreling with his father. His father mostly deliberately challenged after drinking two kinds of wine, acting wildly towards his gentle old wife; but he was not really drunk, because every time after quarreling, he would run to calculate money with people.</p>
<p>He had run away from home for a year. After he ran away, he never thought that he would get sick; would be injured.</p>
<p>"I must always be on guard." He felt very at ease, his breathing was free, although winter was approaching step by step, until he was too frozen to move, and summer turned over again and again, so hot that people died, but life was unburdened, except for death waiting at the very front, there was no second threat and disturbance.</p>
<p>"Why am I thinking about home?" he asked himself as he walked, but at this time, his hand hurt so much that it connected to his heartbeat, and his head felt like it was being cut with a knife. His feet dragged him without destination, walking past 32nd Street, and through every side street of Pear Warehouse Street, loitering beside every tree, finally groaning and leaving.</p>
<p>He went around 29th Street and sat for a while on the tail of the rickshaw parked behind the back door of the Lixing Foreign Firm. He hoped to run into Lao Yang before dark and ask him for some money to stay in a hotel; but he didn't see him.</p>
<p>Home was across the river, just across Copper Bridge and around one street. He usually pulled a rickshaw, avoiding that road as much as possible.</p>
<p>"Will he be half proud and half scolding?" He murmured to himself painfully. The sky slowly darkened, and clusters of lights gathered in the dark urban sky. The ground was moist and slippery. His feet automatically dragged him across Copper Bridge.</p>
<p>He had no other way to go now. He thought of his mother, and his heart beat more painfully, his cheeks flushed with a kind of self-chewing force. He eagerly squeezed into that door.</p>
<p>His mother had already prepared dinner. She was a thin and tired old woman of nearly fifty, wearing an old-fashioned half-gown of silk gauze, with oil stains and tears on the sleeves and chest.</p>
<p>"My child! My child! Have you forgotten?" Like a declining and wounded mother swallow, she called out repeatedly. The old woman stretched out her wet hands in a dreamlike manner, staring at the young man for a long time. A sinister premonition like a bat flew across that old face. Finally, she dried her hands and rubbed them on her skirt. She saw the promise of reality, not a dream. She showed a childlike smile, a smile as if all traces of pain had gone far away, and a smile that seemed to be permeated with pain, and hugged the young man; "Why? Why?" she asked softly, sobbing.</p>
<p>He couldn't answer a word now; he could only shout in his heart; "For the bold breath and that heart-piercing pain!"</p>
<p>An old man with a slightly red mustache and a firm body, carrying a pair of black glazed wine pots, appeared at the door frame with the aura of a former military officer. His eyes shone with stubborn light, stationed there for three minutes.</p>
<p>Outside the window, the early spring weather flowed silently.</p>
<p>The old man wanted to make a quick circle over his fifty years of life, and then stay on a passionate and nostalgic fragment. He only said three words: Young man!</p>
<p>Yang Daquan... Guo Lianqiu Other villagers... Xu Zhen</p>
<h3>Smuggling</h3>
<p>Due to the connivance of certain foreigners, smuggling has spread throughout the country, causing great damage to tax revenue. However, most traitors and vagrants, under the connivance of certain foreigners, are doing their best to engage in smuggling. This kind of "taking advantage of the fire" is already "blatantly penetrating the people" in North China.</p>
<p>In a certain small village in the north, for several days, large mule carts transporting smuggled goods have been passing through every day, escorted by foreigners disguised as Russians.</p>
<p>In this village, the business of making meat pies has been passed down for generations. Now, only Li Yuhua's family remains.</p>
<p>When the night was not very late, there were already few pedestrians on the street. Li Yuhua hurriedly walked back from outside.</p>
<p>"It's bad, it's bad!" he hummed, closing the bucket.</p>
<p>His wife stopped working in surprise and asked him what was wrong.</p>
<p>"It's the big mule carts transporting smuggled goods passing through here again. A few days ago, when they passed through here, someone was dragged away to pull the cart." Li Yuhua deeply feared that he would encounter such a thing, so he hurriedly bolted the door and wanted to avoid being dragged away. His wife also thought that this time might be a little different from the last time! Could it be that even though there are women and children in people's homes in the middle of the night, they would really come in?</p>
<p>However, before long, the sound of knocking on the door gave them proof that these people were indeed breaking into their house in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Li Yuhua anxiously told his wife to get up quickly, but his wife had no choice but to open the door for them to enter.</p>
<p>After this group entered Li's house, they unscrupulously teased and extorted Li's wife, wanting to eat this and that.</p>
<p>Holding a pistol, they threatened Li's wife. Li's wife had no choice but to struggle and had to do whatever they told her to do.</p>
<p>Because there was not enough white sugar to eat with tea, Jia Yunxiang ordered his companion to steal smuggled sugar. Coincidentally, the head was aware of it. The head also chased after him here. So, when Li's wife saw him smashing her beloved chess pieces in front of her, she numbly picked up the pistol on the table and shot the head to death.</p>
<p>At that moment, the villagers followed Li Yuhua to the scene. In a tense atmosphere, they united and forbade the smuggling to pass through the village again.</p>
