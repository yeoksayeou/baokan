<h3>日外相佐藤擬成調整對華關係大綱</h3>
<p>先從變更冀東現狀入手　調石射任外部東亞局長　並設立中國問題審議會</p>
<p>［東京］二日閣議决定任命外務省書記官森島守人為東亞局長、然因事决定調森島為他職、佐藤外相現擬任命駐暹羅公使石射豬太郎爲東亞局長、業於二日發回國命令、（三日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］日外務省非正式决定任命前駐滬總領事現任駐暹羅公使石射豬太郎為該省東亞局長、揆其原因、係外相佐藤尚武對中國事務、缺乏明白之認識、故需要一有力之助手、翊贊確立對華政策之措置、石射對華認識、比較凖確、且其對華態度、似與佐藤相似、故此項調動、極屬重要、去歲石射由滬返日時、曾在各地發表演講、其意見與軍界、大相逕庭、佐藤之與石射合作、雖不能過抱樂觀、期其能打開中日僵局、但石射之調任已含有此種意義、聞佐藤已完成調整對華邦交之大綱、此種工作、將從華北着守、佐藤並已認清在華北各項問題內、冀東現狀、務須多少加以變更、惟何種條件、採取何種方式、以及我國是否能予接受、均為極端重要之問題、目前尚所未悉云、（中央社三日電）</p>
<p>［東京］佐藤外相决定外交重點置於對華政策、擬於最近將來、召開五相會議、商議具體案、外相又為徵求官民各方意見起見、决定設立對華問題審議會、作為研究中國問題之常設機關、本審議會與通商審議會同樣性質、不定官制、羅致外務•陸•海軍•大藏•商工•農林•拓務•各省局長或部長、及民間與中國有關係者中有見識者為委員、各人均可盡量發表對華意見、以資政府確立對華政策之參考、外相此種計劃、可謂對於中日外交問題別開生面、頗為各方面重視、（三日同盟電）</p>

<h3>我們應該怎樣紀念兒童節？</h3>
<p>— 吳俊升</p>
<p>今天是兒童年以後的第一個兒童節。記者作此應節的論文的時候，正在兒童的樂園的美國。我一面目覩美國兒童“席豐履厚”，康健快樂，以及可以儘量發展才能，的種種情形，一面默察中國兒童生活困苦的現狀，恰成一種天壤懸殊的對比；因此不免發生無窮的感慨，同時也覺得兒童節在中國更有特殊的意義，應該有適當的紀念。</p>
<p>大家常說二十世紀是兒童的世紀。這句話在美國是千眞萬確。全世界最有幸福的兒童，是美國的兒童。美國對於兒童的優遇，在“養”，“敎”，和“保護”等等方面，可說是無微不至。就養的方面說，美國兒童的衣，食，住，行，和娛樂的標凖，在任何國的兒童之上。他們的享受，比任何國的兒童都多。就敎的方面說，美國任何兒童，都有憑他自已的智力和學力受最大限度的敎育的機會。初等敎育普及不必說，中等敎育也成爲大衆的敎育。全國的公立的免費中學有二萬五千所之多。全國十四至十七歲的兒童，有半數以上進中學。大學敎育也不是少數人的專利品，凡是智力和學力優長的學生，都有機會進大學。對於智力和體格有缺陷的兒童，復有各式各樣的特殊敎育，儘量彌補他們的天然缺陷。就保護方面說，凡天然的或人為的一切對於兒童的損害，都防範周到。關於兒童作工，有法律的限制。童年犯罪，有特別的法庭審判，並有特設的感化機關。對於兒童的身心健康，更有特設的醫生和護士時時加以檢查和護持。總之，就一切方面說，美國兒童，眞可算是“天之驕子”。</p>
<p>中國兒童的生活情形是怎樣？就養的方面說，大多數的兒童，吃不飽，穿不暖，最低限度的生活，都不能有，更談不到生活程度的提高。就敎的方面說，全國百分之七十以上的兒童，沒有小學可進。中學和大學敎育的無福享受，更不必說。就保護的方面說，天然的人為的對於兒童的損害，大都聽其自然。兒童的死亡率，未見有若干顯著的低减。童工的限制，僅是具文。不人道的徒弟制度，到處沒有改良。溺嬰的惡習，還在流行。對於販賣兒童做奴僕，做娼妓，做各種殘害身體的雜技的表演者，并沒有有效的防止和懲罰。青年犯罪和成年人一樣的懲罰；這種種慘淡的情形和美國兒童的生活情形相比，可說他們眞是在天堂而我們的兒童在地獄。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下紀念兒童節，一定無疑的應該改良我國兒童的生活，增進他們的幸福。我國過去所以規定四月四日爲兒童節，其目的原在看重兒童的價值，增進他們的幸福。自有兒童節以來，也做了不少有利於兒童的事業。尤其是去年的兒童年，對於兒童的幸福，特別注意增進。大家知道兒童幸福的應該注重，這是一種進步。不過我們在中國兒童的種種不幸情形之下，要求改良兒童生活，應該要分出緩急先後。像美國和其他國家對於兒童的種種優厚的待遇，我國固然應該懸為理想，取作模範，可是我們却也不可不分緩急先後的仿效他們的辦法。他們在敎養的保護各方面，已有深厚的基礎。兒童的一般幸福，都已顧到，所以“踵事增華”，更求改善而有種種極優厚的設施。在我國，兒童的最低生活，尚不能維持，一時當然談不到更優厚的待遇。我們越是羨慕和欽佩別國兒童生活的優裕，我們越不應該無選擇的採取別國的辦法，使少數兒童獨得優厚的待遇，使多數兒童不能維持最低的生活。我們現在所應該最先努力的，在於使全國兒童能吃得飽，穿得暖，可以維持最低的生活：在於使全國的兒童能受最低限度的義務教育；在於使全國兒童的身體和精神，得有最低限度的保障，不受天然的，或人為的侵害。這幾件事才是當務之急。其他一切兒童幸福事業，在這幾件事沒有做到以前，都祇是少數兒童的專利，祇是奢侈品，祇是錦上添花的工作，儘可以從緩進行的。這一個分分緩急先後的原則，本來是很簡單的。可是我們過去在提倡兒童節和進行兒童幸福事業的時候，似乎沒有十分注意。我們的工作，似乎在於使一部分已有優越機會的兒童，更得充分的享受，而忽略了大多數連最低限度的幸福都沒有保障的兒童。卽以去年關於兒童年的一切實施而論，有幾仲是惠及大衆而不是祇限於少數兒童的。玩具的展覽麽？吃不飽穿不煖的兒童，玩具對於他們是奢侈品。讀物的陳列麽？根本無機會織字的兒童，一切讀物對於他們是同樣的無意義。首都兒童敎育館的設立麽？那更是極少數的兒童的專利了。這些工作在一般兒童已有最低幸福以後，本都有推行的價值，可是就現狀而論，似乎不是當務之急。我們要“雪中送炭”，我們不要“錦上添花”。</p>
<p>此外我還可以舉一個注意兒童幸福忽略緩急先後的例。近年以來因為倣傚外國的制度，幼稚園和託兒所等等機關，在中國頗有逐漸推廣的趨勢。提早兒童受敎育的年齡本是理想的辦法。可是我們不要忘記，百分之七十以上的應受義務敎育的兒童尚且無學校可進，我們實在無暇推廣這種義務敎育以前的教育。並且在事實上，除了在農村和工業區因為婦女在田間和工廠工作，特別需要此等敎養幼兒的機關以外，在普通城市，根本無此需要。在普通城市中進幼稚園或托兒所的兒童，大多出於中産之家。在此等家庭，做母親的本應盡敎養的責任的。幼稚園或託兒所的設備，徒然解脫了母親的責任，增加了社會的負担，而這些母親也未見得都能挪出時間，做其他有利於社會的事業。在這種情形之下，以增加兒童幸福為目的的這些敎養機關，豈不是又成了奢侈品？我們何不移挪辦理這些機關的經費去推廣亟需的義務小學呢？</p>
<p>以上所舉的幾個事例祇是用來表明辦理，兒童幸福事業應該分別先後緩急的。對於辦理兒童幸福事業者，雖有求全責備的意思，於他們的善意和熱忱，還是不减少應有的贊佩。不過我希望今後大家多多從全國兒童最低限度的幸福的保障方面着想。我們要大家努力，使全國兒童能吃得飽，穿得煖維持最低限度的生活；能普遍享受最低限度的義務敎育：能受法律，道德，和醫藥方面最低限度的保障，使身心不受一切的損害。我們對於兒童幸福事業的設施，如有一分錢，應該先用在這幾方面，如有一分力，也應該先用在這幾方面。等到這些最低限度的幸福實現了，我們再求改良和增加，使我國全體兒童將來可與美國以及其他先進國家的兒童有同樣幸福，這才是紀念兒童節的適當辦法。最後讓我趁本文刊布的機會遙向祖國的兒童祝福，並向一切愛護兒童的人們致敬</p>

<h3>天津日商裕豐紗廠與起卸脚行衝突</h3>
<p>各集數百人準備大械鬥　日方隂謀毀旗以圖嫁禍</p>
<p>天津通信、日商裕豐紗廠、設在特別四區海河北岸、佔地二百餘畝、為日本東洋紡織會社獨資經營、第一廠原定於四月一日開工、旋因籌備不及、故展至五月一日開工、該廠共設紗機五萬錠、織機一千台、均自該國起運到津、所有機件•傢俱•及紡織材料、連日陸續自輪船卸下入廠、依照天津向例、起卸物件、均由脚行辦理、查天津脚行、數百年來、沿襲迄今、均各劃界綫、彼此不互侵越、界內之脚行、均在社會局登記、領有執照、往往有故意侵越者、必聚衆流血、甚至集數百人大械鬥、以爭營業地界、但自社會局規定登記辦法以後、械鬥之事、已不復見、裕豐紗廠所在地之特四區、脚行領袖名吳永昇、集有脚夫二百餘人、以起卸海河進出口貨品為業、亦經社會局合法登記、領有執照、裕豐紗廠出入物件、依例應由吳永昇脚行負責起卸、乃該廠人事課長張鳳三、不顧成例、竟委託一名劉萬元者、另組新脚行、專辦該廠起卸事宜、召募苦力百餘人、三月中旬、開始工作、吳永昇當卽向裕豐紗廠據理交沙、廠方初甚蠻橫、繼恐引起糾紛、所有運到之機件等物、一律改在海河大直沽地方日本國際運輸碼頭泊岸、由日本國際運輸公司以載重汽車運入裕豐紗廠、如此、當地脚行固不能加以干涉、但往返路遠、運費過重、廠方又不合算、於是自三月二十八日起、不顧當地脚行如何、仍逕在特四區由自備之新脚行起卸、當地脚行領袖吳永昇、以侵奪營業、關係數百苦力生活、當又向廠方質問、結果甚不圓滿、雙方為求具體結論、故新舊脚行、各集數百人、準備械鬥、棍棒鐵尺、一應俱全、定於二十九日撕殺、新脚行方面、由日方預備日本國旗甚多、準備於械鬥後、自毀國旗、以圖引起交涉、而使事態嚴重化、事為警察局探知、深恐械鬥流血、互有傷亡、徒增無謂糾紛、急遺武裝保安隊二百名、馳往彈壓、一面電請日警署轉令裕豐紗廠、制止新脚行暴動、社會局根據當地脚行吳永昇報告、三十一日晨、派由勞働股主任白殿華•科員張士瑾、馳往裕豐紗廠調查眞相、進行調解、日方提出要求三項、㊀廠內出入起卸貨物、有自由委託脚行之權、㊁由當地脚行吳永昇書立悔過書、承認行動無理、㊂入廠物件由當地脚行承運、出廠物件、廠方另委新脚行辦理、當地脚行不得干涉、吳永昇方面、為營業利益計、則請社會局顧全威信、堅持到底、此事正由社會局調解中、但日方條件甚苛、恐難接受、雙方猶正僵持不下、而數百苦力、更磨拳擦掌，準備一拚、據調查、脚行地界為世襲制度、彼此守界、數百年來未常變更、社會局於上年十月間、舉辦脚行登記、將全市脚行加以調整、發給執照、准其守法營業、此次裕豐紗廠自欲設立脚行、實出意外、倘准其破例、此端一開、必紛起效尤、日本在津工商業甚多、起卸事務亦至繁、倘皆自立脚行、破壞從前界限、不惟影響社會局威信、且行見為爭脚行營業流血械鬥之事、接踵而至、無有寗日、事關地方治安市府特於一日晨、令飭社會局妥為處理、勿令糾紛蔓延、免伏隱患、（一日）</p>
<h3>南遊鱗爪（三）</h3>
<p>— 君寶</p>
<p>馬來人的精神生活，有　　娛樂，樂器與我國差不多，構造粗糙，音調簡單。鑼，鼓，與我國相同：琴與胡琴相似；另有以多數木板或銅板製成樂器，自左而右，板之長短，依次遞增，與風琴形式略相似，以錘叩之而成高低不同之音。</p>
<p>舞蹈的種類至多，在一遊藝塲中，也可以看見數種，但動作均簡單，僅作前後左右的進退，很少表情，戲劇多關男女愛情及神怪故事。</p>
<p>他們的迷信最深，是萬有靈魂主義，到處都充滿迷信的恐怖。然有許多地方與我國相似，確是比我國迷信更深固，山川草木以及動物死體都認爲有鬼神憑式，死人更不用說。他們把疾病，死亡以及種種不幸事件，都認作是鬼神作崇。尤其是對於巫蠱魔術的人，更神聖不敢侵犯。據說巫蠱是以魔術做專業，能操縱一切禍福，吉凶，不獨可治療疾病，預（三）君實卜　咎，並可代人雪憤，報仇。</p>
<p>大部分馬來人皆信奉回敎，每星期五到回敎堂去念可蘭經Koren，故星期五稻爲經日。可蘭經是修身齊家的寶典，他們雖然信奉回敎，同時他們對於一切自然物的迷信，照樣是很深刻的。</p>
<p>男女間的階級很深，女子在男子前面走過，只能俯身疾走，不許挺胸直行，送物給男子，也要跪進，這與日本風俗相同。</p>
<p>他們携帶輕重物件，都用頭戴，而不用肩挑的，除非是華僑敎他們挑。</p>
<p>馬來回敎徒在幼小時必須舉行一個最嚴重的典禮就是未成年的男女都須舉行割不男子陰莖包皮、女子的陰唇，均須割去少許，這是一生中的一個大典。否則不齒於同類。</p>
<p>凡婚娶喜慶乃貴族出外時須張傘蓋，傘有等級不同，與我國以前情况相似。</p>
<p>馬來人的喪葬，是用火葬或藁葬，墳墓上頭足兩端，各立石碑一條，男子墓碑爲圓柱形，女　長方形。</p>
<h3>婆羅洲達耶克人</h3>
<p>獵人頭之殘酷行為，仍盛行於婆羅洲及新幾內亞土人間，新幾內亞土人全體裸露，女子僅用貝殼或椰葉遮蔽陰部或徧體繪着花紋，以猪骨或魚骨刺鼻，與牛鼻相似，飲食時則拔去之。鼻凖兩旁，由上端刺入二根骨又由鼻左右橫插入一骨恰如非洲土人橫插入一圓板。使突出於外，爲同樣之奇風。</p>
<p>南洋的人種，據華勒斯（A·R·Wallace）意見認爲可分二大派，卽馬來羣島的住民爲馬來亞人種，而新幾內亞及其他各島的住民爲巴布亞人種，因爲無論從體格上精神上，和道德上都根本不同。近年來多數人類學家的意見，大致分南洋羣島的民族爲四個系統，卽</p>
<p>一•類黑人種——（西孟族，沙蓋族）</p>
<p>二·外答族——（錫蘭人）</p>
<p>三•純粹馬來族</p>
<p>四•混血馬來族</p>
<p>關于這些人種各個問題，暫不細說。現將關於馬來民族的起源的探討，略記如次：馬來民族起源，有種推測，（一）人種學家以為來自亞洲。凡散布恒河以東，直至新幾內亞　止之人種均有關係。據學者推測在婆羅洲，蘇門答臘未被海洋隔絕以前這兩地都是馬來人與原始馬來人種族之居留地，（二）馬來各島嶼未被海洋分隔前，有一與馬來民族完全不同之民族及原始馬來族，混血馬來族等所居住（三）葛恩氏Korn以爲馬來人故鄉是古婆Clarnpa,交趾支那，Cochin-China東埔寨Campooia等處，（四）根據語言方面，馬來民族或許來自印度與中國間地帶，（五）原始馬來人或爲類似蒙古種之混合種族（見南洋研究五卷四期拙譯馬來人種）許多人類學者對南洋羣島的人種，曾苦心研究，但因人種學材料搜集不完備，莫衷一是。</p>

<h3>史考托杯結束法商榮膺冠軍</h3>
<p>四比二决賽勝勞逸爾　上半時法商二零佔先</p>
<p>本屆史考托盃足球錦標賽、法商與勞逸爾、昨日下午二時半、在逸園球塲舉行决賽、上半時法商飽休脫連續頂人兩球、以二比○佔先、下半時法商飽休脫法凡笑又相繼建功、旣被勞逸爾籍十二碼扳回一球於先、特飛命中於後、結果四比二法商榮獲錦標、昨日下午天氣陰沉、以兩隊均為西人、故國人前往觀賽者不及外人之多、半元座位、十座九空、雙方陣容如下、</p>
<h3>法商隊合作甚佳</h3>
<p>昨賽法商會藉合作純熟護勝、鮑休脫連中三球、應居首功、兩度頭頂、清晰美麗、確屬不易、兩翼亦活躍非凡、後衛馬山兒穏健有加、與勞隊推勒大鬥法衛、柯萊脫亦不差、傑克華特看住惠丁、輸送殊得力、培爾人小膽大、中鋒勞勃司托夫、無多大作爲往、往越位、門將鮑賽仲表演殊佳、反視勞逸爾門將麥克耐萊經騐缺乏、兩後衛尚佳、前衛較弱、兩翼衝刺極速、尤以推勒為最、惟盤球太多、惠丁則被制於傑克、與兩內鋒均無良好表演、惟全隊長力甚足、實非法商可及、下半時幾次良機、均以遠射失去、殊爲可惜、</p>
<h3>鮑休脫連頂連中</h3>
<p>勞逸先開球、夏泊爾斯球傳克萊頓、盤過柯萊脫、舉足便射、為鮑賽仲雙手接得、由傑克華特遠送法凡笑、沿邊挺進、鈞送威利華特、威力射、麥克耐萊拍出未遠、勞勃司托夫拚命趕上、奈已被耶茲救出、旋法商傑克又一脚遠挑、球入法凡笑脚下、盤至底邊、鈎向中央、拾到好處、鮑休脫候個正着、縱身一頂、首開紀念、至此法商氣熖更盛、勞隊惠丁法凡笑亦兩度發射、均被鮑賽仲臥地撲出、法商難關一過、五鋒齊進、威利華特、在弗利孟脚下奪獲皮球、派司法凡笑、法向中一鈎、鮑休脫趕上、如法泡製、又是一頂入網、離上球約十分鍾、未幾上半時終了、法商以二對○佔先</p>
<h3>勞逸爾慘遭敗北</h3>
<p>易地再戰、勞逸爾努力反攻、推勒渡過培爾、傳球特飛特盤前數步馬山兒來阻、回傳推勒、以夏泊爾斯越位、無功而返、古萊頓攻門、又被救出、旣而法商鮑休脫帶球急進、耶茲出阻、麥克耐萊得從容將球踢出、傑克得球、一脚遠送、球自威利轉傳鮑休脫、鮑見門前無人、側身猛射、又中紅鵠、離開賽僅三分鍾耳、法商頓以三比零佔先、勞隊見勢不佳、急起直追惠丁特飛兩次遠射、均入鮑賽仲懷中、克萊開角球、拉愛脫叩門、球越橫木、旋法凡笑得傑克來球、從右路盤進衝過兩關、卽舉足射門、球出如矢、從左角竄入、成四對○、旣而培爾推人犯規判罰十二碼、由夏泊爾斯執行、扳回一球、至此法商已現疲態、勞隊反見饒男、法商門前竟成衆矢之的、法商雖亦有數度反攻、而勞勃司托夫竟心慌意亂、兩度以手觸球被罰、旋推勒進攻、阻於馬山兒特飛趕上從容得球射入、勞隊從此氣勢大盛、傾師進攻、鮑賽仲臥地救球、致被跌傷幸頃刻卽愈、此後競爭雖烈、但各無所獲、銀笛聲起、注商遂以四對二獲得錦標、東華保持二年之盃、亦由法商領去云、</p>

<p>收盤大戶購買尤烈　標紗前市開盤、各月呈參差不一之象、因外棉回挫、大都心理看有回頭之望、詎料入後、市盤步步飛騰、蓋以現紗根子緊俏、空頭急來抵補、據云某君獨進二萬包外標紗結果、各月比上日收盤價均漲一元半至二三元、午後開盤、各月略見回風、下跌七•八角至一元、但二盤裕大長覺又來拖進市盤復升、迨至三收盤、多方購買尤烈結果各月比上午收盤價再漲一•四角、查賣出森康五千二百包、吉豐三千二百包、同孚一千一百包、聚興一千四百包、賡豐五千七百包、興昌二千四百包、愼記二千六百五十包、義成一千四百五十包、大昌成四千八百包、潤康一千八百五十包、恊成二千二百包、生源一千一百五十包、永大一千四百包、買進恒益六千五百包、裕大一萬五千包、錦昌六千四百包、仁豐一千五百包、長豐一萬一千二百包、望泰興一千六百包恒昌一千六百五十包、福康一千七百五十包、一日間最高低市盤列左、</p>
<p>現銷比較上日為少　現紗銷路較上日為少、查全日各帮買去統計一千四百五十四包、售價漲二元、各帮買額如下、</p>
<h3>期花上漲較艱</h3>
<p>棉市轉疲、因美棉回挫、現貨復跌破一角五分關口、兼之棉商多數在空頭地位、且有一部份仍係買紗賣花、因此棉市較紗市爲軟、不過各路存底見减、現棉情形緊俏、</p>
<p>幸有標紗之助力　標花前市開盤、因美印棉市俱見下降、市氣轉挫各月呈下落之象、二盤後、被紗市帶起、迨至收盤仍屬平庸、不若紗市之昴、標花結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一•二•角、午后開盤、市况甚疲、因大戶抛賣、二盤平平、迨至收盤因紗市上升、棉市帶好、結果惟五月漲五分、其餘勿動、查賣出泰興二千三百擔明德五千九百擔、恒益九千八百擔、聚興二恊成二千二百擔、永大二千六百擔、益康二千三百擔、望泰興二千九百擔、源興昌二千一百擔、長和五千五百擔、買進吉豐四千一百擔、梅記二千擔、大孚三千二百擔、裕大六千八百擔、錦昌三千八百担、合興五千担，仁豐二千九百担、元一三千一百担、長豐一萬二千六百担、福康二千四百担、新昶二千四百担、同和一千七百担、一日間行市高低比較於下、</p>
<p>現棉消售略减少　現棉消費尚稱不薄、不過較前日為稀云、</p>
<h3>美棉多頭大批了結</h3>
<p>各月回小二十磅音左右</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、刊物浦清息不佳、外商多頭大批了結、及倒限價轉賣、各月跌十四至二十四磅音、押欵棉花出售之展期、現棉已缺再度緊張之情勢、其後、因羅斯福總統警告、不適宜之漲價、將引起巨量棉田及大部物價與股市均疲市價續軟、惟同業在低價時、依然吸進、新投機家亦有購買、收盤時、略有補空、計現貨跌十九磅音、期貨跌十九至廿三磅音、英棉現貨跌八點、期貨跌七八點、印棉因散多了結及證券帮大批轉賣而跌、惟售額均爲日商及大陸出口商所吸收、計平果兩跌三羅比、奧姆辣跌一•七五羅比、白羅溪跌一•五至二•二五羅比、原電錄後、（二日電）　　又據孟買電、三日開盤預測、白羅溪爲二百四十八羅比半、平果爾為二百○一羅比半、均跌○•七五羅比、奧姆辣為二百三十七羅比、跌一羅比、</p>

<p>粉市上午開盤後各月份市而、呈初平繼漲之象以洋麥報價、芝加哥回好四角半、坎拿大近好九角、達好四七角不等、當開價時、以實銷仍少暢辦之訊、業外多頭、隨市了結、故市氣甚平、較前日微見小面、二盤以後、本月份交易轉清、上落無幾七月份以下之新紛、則業外買氣驟旺、市價步挺、迨至下午開盤、初尚平靜、旋以內地廠家、突起抵空、市氣步俏、而多頭之了結者、反見不暢因此逐開逐高、較前日提漲三分、五月份交易雖少、價亦跟提、七月份以下、因廠抛不湧、吸戶頗暢、故又續提一二分、此後之本月份局面、如實銷轉活、暫時須穏站云云、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤、各月份市面、大致平隠、因本月份交易不暢、買賣多　觀望、六七月份、因人時陰晴、人心周定、八九月份、則業外套買提好三分、迨至下午開盤、本月份因紛市轉佳提好一分、六月份未開、七月份以下因內地帮之套貨、在新麥未見之變、自然觀望、而外行吸戶、則仍有收進、故又提三四分、現麥市面、尚見平站、開洋河瑤灣麥六元四角半、江北麥六元三角三分、高郵麥六元三角五六分、天台麥六元二角一分、二角、由福新去二千包、申大去八百包云、</p>

<p>昨日北市河下客路來閘船戶二十一二號、市上各貨去路、早市平談、白粳價形疲去數分、至近角、午市店胃進取轉活、價形挺立、薄稻頂貨價平定、中次者價數分、各秞形價疲七八分、白元價小五六分、其餘各米價疲勢、今明兩日、因各行春假之閑、休業兩天、六日照常開市、</p>

<p>昨日現貨黃豆市况、一因大連休市二則週末、三值掃菓節、致少興奮、行情亦無軒輊、交易祇開蚌埠豆一車、臨淮關豆一車、四平街豆一車、郯城豆二百包、沙市豆二百包、及沙黃三百包、乍豆一百包、洋莊芝蔴略見回好些、但去路依然平常、昨祇西商辦去二十五噸、價爲十四元四角、現貨毛蔴因洋莊稍有動動、市况比較前市形呈活絡沙市蔴已開十一元六角矣、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>一個備忘錄</h3>
<p>— 方克文</p>
<p>又是兒童節了。兒童是未來的國家的柱石，定這麽一天，有一個紀念節日，使兒童歡樂一天，也促起留心兒童敎養問題者及為父母者的注意，這個原則是無可非議的。不過，兒童節如果僅僅是在兒童節這一天促起大人們一些注意，對兒童們的前途，沒有計劃和實踐：兒童如果僅僅是給兒童們一個歡暢游樂的機會，設法給他們玩一天，“優待”他們一天，等兒童節一過，又扔在一旁，任憑他們在污水潭裏打滾，生長，等第二個兒童節到來再把他們拉出來，“優待”他們一天，那麽，這樣的兒童節，還是有等於無的。</p>
<p>我們過去的兒童節是怎樣？今日的兒童節又做了些什麽呢？</p>
<p>過去的，有現在的事實在做證人：今日的，則將來又會有事實來告訴我們。自古以來，不論怎樣高超的理論，不論怎樣動人的計劃，祇要你把它和行為，事實對證一下，是是否否，是一切都無所遁影，也設法可以遮掩或抹煞的。</p>
<p>我門對過去的是盡了怎樣的力呢？功過我不敢論，也不必論放在我們面前的事實是流浪孩童們還是充塞在街頭：在天災人禍的鄉村間，易子而食的慘劇還在不斷地産生：“嬰兒殺戳，等於奴隸的學徒制，和嬌奢殘橫，飯來動手，菜來動口的富家兒郎，恰好成一個顯明的對照關於兒童的敎養，不是“棒頭出孝子”，把子女打成像一匹煨灶貓，便是放縱得像一匹野馬，任憑他們去亂衝亂跑。而迷信的空氣又濃烈的瀰漫着，爲了養不住孩子，結果把孩子的大姆指剪了，說是可以破“討債鬼”的法，以及棄屍荒郊等，更是不久前挺新鮮的，也是由來已久的新聞，而私生子的被遺棄被墮胎，以及偷偷地送進育嬰堂去的，更不在內。</p>
<p>這些，是生活在泥潭裏或是生活在天堂裏的孩子們所遭過到的。中層階級的孩子們又怎樣呢？在弄堂裏“打彈子，”小糖攤上賭白相大世界，二言不合，也會㧞出小拳頭打一通架。據本市健康敎育委員會最近所發表的統計，則云本市自去年九月至本年一月在各小學校受檢查的九千餘學生之體格中，其有缺點者佔百分之九十稍弱。這是一個怎樣驚人的數目！</p>
<p>自然，這些都是往缺點去看的，然而缺點却又何以其多！例如流浪兒童問題吧，這已經够使社會學家及敎育家們頭痛了，而另外又有敎養問題等等難於應付的題目。兒童是未來國家的棟樑，然而現在我們却發現這些樑木上是爬滿了蛀蟲了</p>
<p>揀好的來說，例如小先生運動及新安旅行團的小朋友們一面學習，一面生活等，固然未嘗沒有，然而，却又何見其少。並且，這些還大都出於孩子們本身的力量，大人們對之，是祇能愧汗的。</p>
<p>這是張備忘錄。我的希望也不敢太奢，我祇希望明年今日，我們能够多揀幾件好的來說，少發現一些蛀蟲，以及更見朽腐的楝樑。</p>
<h3>黑龍江畔</h3>
<p>— 鄒衡</p>
<p>江水，劃開了兩個不同顔色的世界，挾着黃金的寒風，把江上造成一片黃色的迷霧，兩岸的景物，都消隱在這朦朧的迷霧里</p>
<p>春天過去，風消逝了，霧展開了，綠色的杉林，裝滿了對峙在兩岸的小嶺上，附近已墾開的，一熟田里，都長滿高粱同玉粟的新芽，太陽溫和地照着，似乎並沒有注意到這兩個不同世界的糾紛，却把同樣的態度來看待她。</p>
<p>在南岸，伴着杉林，你可以看到有幾所簡陋的士屋，那兒便是徐家窩鋪，屋子矮得像幾個乾癟的饅頭，可憐地伏俯在江邊的山脚下，士牆的一角，高峙着像尾巴一樣的砲樓，那是過去的“割萌蘆”後防馬搶掠砲疊，現在却作了皇家軍人的瞭望台了。幾個穿着黃呢制服，荷着槍的皇家軍人，在門前慢步着，有時也向隔江瞭望一下，或隨意地拾起塊石子，用力的向對岸一拋，這似乎是向隔岸的敵人示威，又好像在藉此練練臂力，但石子却永遠只拋到江心，便沉落下去，隨後是一聲無力的迴嚮，江水依然平靜的流去</p>
<p>隔江，同樣的有個小嶺好像兩個天然砲台，兩面對峙着，山脚江岸，也參差地生着人來高的杉林，此外便是一望無盡的西伯利亞大曠野。這里過去，只是半開化的魚皮噠子，“和中國的獵人出沒的塲所，現在却也築有石塊的砲疊，門外也站着荷槍徘徊的士兵，當然野獸同獵者的蹤跡已很少見到了。</p>
<p>在這里，照例每天的下午，斜陽的餘睴把江水染成一片燦爛的金波時，一個扶杖的老人，携着一個十一二歲的小孩，拖着瘦長的影子，從曠野遠處，躑躅地走來，他一直走到江干盡頭，才立住脚。老人照例是不說什麽，只向對岸用力的瞭望着但是孩子却不能永遠沉默，總喜歡拉扯着問幾句，那也多半是很簡單的。</p>
<p>“爺爺，這里又看到咱們家了，咱們多怎回家？”</p>
<p>“你看，”孩子指着江的那岸，“咱們的砲樓上懸了旗子呢。爺爺，你看不見罷？</p>
<p>“爺爺老了，眼也不中用了，還是你小孩子的眼睛來得及——你看見那旗子是什麽顏色嗎？”</p>
<p>“有紅的………”</p>
<p>“紅的？”老人急問，顯然這給了他莫大的興奮。“還有什麽色？”</p>
<p>“只有一個紅的珠珠，再也沒了什麽色了。”</p>
<p>“唉，”老人重重地嘆一口氣，兩手突然放鬆，身子便整個傾斜到孩子身上</p>
<p>“爺爺，你怎麽了？”孩子一面問着，一面扶住老人瘦弱的身軀，又輕輕地放在身後的石塊上，使他平穏地坐下。老人的頭倚着孩子的胸，慢慢地喘着，這極端興奮之後的突然的打擊，使他暫時陷入迷惘的狀態。</p>
<p>“孩子，咱們再也看不到咱們的國旗了！”老人喘息了一會，無力的吐出這樣一句話來。孩子顯然沒有理會得，小小的心靈，只注意在老人的臉上，他每到老人能够說話，便覺到天大事都平息了。</p>
<p>太陽漸漸隱藏了，江上升起一層白色的薄霧，隔岸蒙了一層輕紗，土屋，砲樓，小嶺，都逐漸地消滅在霧層里。</p>
<p>“孩子，旗子還看得見嗎？老人注視了會江上，這樣問。</p>
<p>“那兒什麽都看不見了，連咱們的屋子都被霧給蒙住囉，爺爺，咱們幾時能回家呢？”這話像電一樣，震擊了老人，他忘不了家，半生來就沒離開過它，自從那年皇帝登了寶殿，命運便捉弄了他，為了自家的土地不讓給那穿白袍子的高麗棒子，兩個兒子便給人打死了</p>
<p>“如果在家里，恐怕田里的玉粟也長這樣高了”老人痛心的想着，這僅僅里巴路寬的江水，却把他留到另一個國度了，</p>
<p>霧更濃密了，江面白茫茫一片，像面銀灰色的大幕，把周圍的景物團團圍住，孩子緊緊挨着老祖父，膽怯的握住老人的手，輕聲地問：</p>
<p>“爺爺，咱們回去吧！”</p>
<p>在歸途，老人用左手扶杖，右手挨在孩子的肩上，在濃霧里，踏着輕軟的草徑，懷着滿腔的悲憤和悔恨。</p>
<p>霧依然濃濃地，江面灼着砲疊上的探照燈，兩個黑影在荒野上踽踽地幌着。</p>

<h3>Reorganization of Subordinate Departments and Bureaus of the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>Preparations Completed, Officially Announced Yesterday; Slight Adjustments to Personnel in Various Agencies</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The organizational laws of the Ministry of Finance and its subordinate Customs and Revenue Departments, as well as the Salt Administration, were amended and passed by the Legislative Yuan and submitted to the National Government. After being promulgated in July last year, Minister Kong ordered his subordinates to comply with the reorganization. After months of preparation, it was officially announced on the 3rd. The details are as follows: The Ministry originally had three departments: Customs, Salt, and Revenue; six divisions: General Affairs, Taxation, Public Debt, Currency, Treasury, and Accounting; as well as the Inspectorate General of Customs and the Salt Revenue Audit Office. The new organizational law largely follows the old system for the organization of the various departments and divisions, except that the Salt Department has been changed to the Salt Administration Division, the Accounting Division has been abolished and renamed the Accounting Director's Office, and the Salt Revenue Audit Office has been changed to the Salt Administration Bureau. Therefore, the actual reorganization is only in the Salt Department and the Accounting Division within the Ministry, and only the Salt Revenue Audit Office outside the Ministry. There are no major changes to the rest. The positions of Director of the Salt Department and Director of the Salt Revenue Audit Office were originally held concurrently by Zhu Tingqi. The Ministry has now ordered Zhu Tingqi to serve exclusively as Director of the Salt Administration Bureau and has appointed Luo Hatuo, an American who was the Business Manager of the Salt Revenue Audit Office, as the Business Manager of the Salt Administration Bureau. Ma Taijun, the former Section Chief of the Salt Department, has been temporarily appointed as Director of the Salt Administration Division. Pang Songzhou, the former Director of the Accounting Division, was previously appointed by the National Government's Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics as the Accounting Director of the Ministry. The reorganization of the Division is that Director Pang reorganized the original Accounting Division personnel into the Accounting Director's Office in accordance with the provisions of the new organizational law. In summary, the Ministry's original staffing levels, except for a small number that need to be reduced due to exceeding the provisions of the new organizational law, are only job-related adjustments. The Secretariat of the Ministry originally had two sections, which must be abolished in accordance with the provisions of the new organizational law. Qian Wenqiao and Qian Jing, the original section chiefs, have been transferred to be inspectors of the Revenue Department. All secretaries will henceforth work in five groups. In addition, Sun Xiaocun, Section Chief of the Taxation Division of the Ministry, has resigned and has been approved. Hong Huaizu, a secretary, has been temporarily appointed to fill the vacancy. The internal reorganization of the Salt Administration Bureau and the establishment of salt administration bureaus in various salt-producing areas will be carried out step by step by the newly appointed Director Zhu Tingqi in accordance with laws and regulations. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance made the following adjustments to key personnel in its subordinate agencies on the 3rd: Chen Xing, concurrently Director of the Central Mint, has requested to resign from his concurrent post, which has been approved.

Fan Guang, Director of the Zhejiang Stamp Tax and Tobacco Bureau, has been transferred to be a counselor of the Ministry, and Huang Zupei, Deputy Director of the Bureau, has been promoted to fill the vacancy.

Wang Wenwei, Director of the Sichuan Regional Revenue Bureau, has been transferred to be a specialist of the Ministry, and Ding Chungao, Director of the Hunan-Jiangxi Regional Revenue Bureau, has been appointed to fill the vacancy. Li Rongkai, Special Secretary of the Ministry, has been appointed to fill the vacancy left by Ding. It is said that the above appointments were carefully decided by Minister Kong before his departure abroad and are said to be suitable for the positions and the people.

<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Plans to Formulate Outline for Adjusting Relations with China</h3>
<p>Starting with Changing the Current Situation in Eastern Hebei; Transfers Ishii to Head the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Establishes Council for Deliberation on Chinese Affairs</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Cabinet meeting on the 2nd decided to appoint Morishima Morito, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as Director of the East Asia Bureau. However, due to circumstances, it was decided to transfer Morishima to another position. Foreign Minister Sato is now planning to appoint Ishii Jotaro, the ambassador to Thailand, as Director of the East Asia Bureau and issued a recall order on the 2nd. (3rd Allied Press Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has unofficially decided to appoint Ishii Jotaro, the former Consul General in Shanghai and current Ambassador to Thailand, as Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry. The reason is that Foreign Minister Sato Naotake lacks a clear understanding of Chinese affairs, so he needs a powerful assistant to help him establish measures for a policy toward China. Ishii's understanding of China is relatively accurate, and his attitude toward China seems similar to that of Sato, so this transfer is extremely important. When Ishii returned to Japan from Shanghai last year, he gave speeches in various places, and his opinions were very different from those of the military. Although cooperation between Sato and Ishii cannot be viewed with excessive optimism, it is hoped that they can break the Sino-Japanese deadlock. However, Ishii's transfer already contains this meaning. It is said that Sato has completed an outline for adjusting diplomatic relations with China, and this work will start from North China. Sato has also recognized that within the various issues in North China, the current situation in Eastern Hebei must be changed to some extent. However, what conditions should be adopted, what methods should be used, and whether China can accept them are all extremely important issues that are currently unknown. (3rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato has decided to focus diplomatic efforts on China policy and plans to convene a Five-Minister Conference in the near future to discuss concrete proposals. In order to solicit opinions from officials and the public, the Foreign Minister has decided to establish a Council for Deliberation on Chinese Affairs as a permanent body for studying Chinese issues. This council is of the same nature as the Trade Deliberation Council, is not part of the official system, and will recruit bureau chiefs or ministers from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, Navy, Finance, Commerce and Industry, Agriculture and Forestry, and Colonial Affairs, as well as knowledgeable people from the private sector who have relations with China as members. Everyone can express their opinions on China to the fullest extent to provide a reference for the government to establish a policy toward China. The Foreign Minister's plan can be said to be a new approach to Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues and is highly valued by all parties. (3rd Allied Press Telegram)</p>

<h3>Central Government Approves Reasons for Guangdong Exempting Taxes on Imported Rice</h3>
<p>Current Value is the Time Between Harvests, Profiteers Manipulate Prices; Seeking to Stabilize Grain Prices by Artificial Means</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding Guangdong Province's import of foreign grain rice, it is now known that the Ministry of Finance has indeed approved the tax exemption for 2 million piculs. The import date is from the 1st of this month to the end of August this year. However, it is only allowed to be sold within Guangdong Province. If it is exported from the province, import taxes must still be paid. The reporter previously learned that the Central Government only allowed Guangdong Province to import foreign rice and grain within 1 million piculs and to record half of the import tax payable. Now, it is completely tax-exempt. The differences are obvious. I specially visited a certain authority to inquire about the matter. According to reports, the reason for the great difference in these measures is the difference in the current situation. Guangdong Province previously faced a food crisis that was worrisome, and the need for relief was very urgent. When the Central Government approved the exemption of import taxes on foreign rice, it only allowed half to be recorded, because the relief of the rice shortage in Guangdong Province was very urgent at the time. However, it was also after the domestic new grain was launched on the market. If the import tax on foreign grain rice was completely exempted, it would inevitably affect the sales of domestic rice. In order to take both into account, this compromise had to be made. This time, the province requested that the import tax on foreign rice and grain be completely exempted, and the Central Government approved it within a considerable limit, because it is now the time between harvests, and rice prices in Guangdong Province are rising due to the hoarding and manipulation of profiteers. People are finding it difficult to find food. The Central Government is concerned about the suffering of the people of Guangdong, so it has approved the tax exemption for imported foreign grain rice, so as to increase the amount of rice and grain on the market and seek to stabilize the price of grain in Guangdong Province by artificial means. Some say that this method will harm the interests of farmers. However, most farmers now have no surplus grain at home and still have to buy high-priced rice and grain from the market for food. If the price of grain can be reduced, farmers can benefit more. When the new grain is launched on the market in the future, this tax exemption method will be abolished, and farmers will not be affected. (3rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Unified Cigarette Tax to be Collected by Grade Starting April 5</h3>
<p>Original Two-Tier Collection Method Changed to Four Tiers; Increased Taxes on Cotton Yarn, Matches, and Cement are Being Planned</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance will change the original two-tier collection method for the unified cigarette tax to a four-tier collection method starting on the 5th. The tax schedule is more detailed than before. The increased unified taxes on cotton yarn, matches, and cement are still being planned. Because cigarette factories are concentrated in Shanghai, the Revenue Department has contacted various cigarette merchants to complete preparations and will implement them starting on the 5th. The new tax rate has increased by 20 percent, stipulating that those with a registered price of 800 yuan or more per 50,000 cigarettes are in the first tier and will be taxed 800 yuan; those with a registered price of 400 yuan or more but less than 800 yuan are in the second tier and will be taxed 400 yuan; those with a registered price of 200 yuan or more but less than 400 yuan are in the third tier and will be taxed 200 yuan; those with a registered price of less than 200 yuan are in the fourth tier and will be taxed 100 yuan. It is estimated that the annual cigarette tax was more than 90 million yuan under the old tax rate. After the tax increase, it is estimated that it can increase by about 20 million yuan per year. Because the factories for matches, cotton yarn, and cement are scattered throughout the country, there are still many procedures to be contacted with the factories in advance, so the implementation date has not been determined. Among them, the unified tax on matches is easier to implement, and it has been decided to only increase the tax without increasing the grade, so the original two categories and two grades will not be changed. The second is cement, which will also only increase the tax, with no other procedures. Cotton yarn is more complicated and will be changed from two grades to four grades, so that the tax rates on coarse and fine yarns are fairly burdened. It is rumored that cotton yarn will increase by 60 percent, but this is not true, because it has not yet been decided. It is also said that the unified taxes on matches and cement will be implemented after the unified cigarette tax. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Plans to Settle China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Debts</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Resolving the problems of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been hindered by its debts, which still amount to over 30 million as of now. Although business improved last year, interest on the debts cannot be covered. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications plans to find a way to settle the company's debts and will also begin adjusting the assessment of the company's assets. However, land prices have fallen in recent years and are not worth large sums. Furthermore, of the company's vessels operating on domestic, overseas, and Yangtze River routes, only about 20 are in usable condition in terms of age and equipment. The remaining ones either need major repairs due to being outdated, or have inadequate internal equipment that requires reconstruction. For example, the Haiheng, which recently began operating on the Xiamen-Philippines route, seems to be too small in tonnage. Future ocean routes cannot be handled by the existing vessels. The company's proposal is to increase capital by 10 million yuan to purchase vessels and build wharves and warehouses along the routes. The Ministry of Communications has submitted its opinions and requested the Executive Yuan to forward them to the Central Political Council for a decision on resources.

<h3>How Should We Commemorate Children's Day?</h3>
<p>— Wu Junsheng</p>
<p>Today is the first Children's Day after the Children's Year. As I, the reporter, write this essay to mark the occasion, I am in the United States, the paradise of children. On one hand, I witness the "abundant and comfortable" lives of American children, their health and happiness, and the various ways in which they can fully develop their talents. On the other hand, I silently observe the current state of hardship in the lives of Chinese children, a stark contrast like heaven and earth. This inevitably evokes endless emotions, and I also feel that Children's Day has a more special meaning in China and should be commemorated appropriately.</p>
<p>Everyone often says that the 20th century is the century of children. This statement is absolutely true in the United States. The happiest children in the world are the children of the United States. The preferential treatment of children in the United States, in terms of "nurturing," "education," and "protection," can be said to be meticulous. In terms of nurturing, the standards of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and entertainment for American children are above those of children in any other country. They enjoy more than children in any other country. In terms of education, any child in the United States has the opportunity to receive the maximum amount of education based on their intelligence and academic ability. Needless to say, primary education is universal, and secondary education has also become mass education. There are more than 25,000 public, free secondary schools nationwide. More than half of the children aged 14 to 17 across the country attend secondary school. University education is also not a privilege of a few; any student with superior intelligence and academic ability has the opportunity to attend university. For children with intellectual and physical disabilities, there are various types of special education to compensate for their natural deficiencies as much as possible. In terms of protection, all natural or man-made harm to children is carefully prevented. There are legal restrictions on child labor. Juvenile delinquency is tried in special courts, and there are specially established reform institutions. For the physical and mental health of children, there are specially appointed doctors and nurses who constantly check and support them. In short, in all respects, American children can truly be called "the favored children of heaven."</p>
<p>What is the living situation of Chinese children? In terms of nurturing, most children do not have enough to eat, not enough to wear, and cannot have the minimum standard of living, let alone improve their living standards. In terms of education, more than 70% of children nationwide do not have primary schools to attend. It goes without saying that they do not have the fortune to enjoy secondary and university education. In terms of protection, most natural and man-made harms to children are left to nature. The mortality rate of children has not seen any significant reduction. Restrictions on child labor are merely empty words. The inhumane apprentice system has not been improved anywhere. The evil practice of infanticide is still prevalent. There is no effective prevention or punishment for the sale of children as slaves, prostitutes, or performers of various body-damaging acrobatic acts. Young people are punished the same as adults for crimes. Compared with the living situation of American children, these tragic circumstances show that they are truly in heaven, while our children are in hell.</p>
<p>Commemorating Children's Day under these circumstances should undoubtedly improve the lives of our country's children and increase their happiness. The original purpose of stipulating April 4th as Children's Day in our country was to value the worth of children and increase their happiness. Since Children's Day began, many beneficial things have been done for children. In particular, last year's Children's Year paid special attention to increasing children's happiness. It is a progress that everyone knows that children's happiness should be emphasized. However, in view of the various unfortunate circumstances of Chinese children, we should prioritize what is urgent and important when seeking to improve their lives. Like the various preferential treatments that the United States and other countries give to children, our country should certainly regard them as ideals and take them as models, but we must also prioritize what is urgent and important when imitating their methods. They already have a solid foundation in education, nurturing, and protection. The general happiness of children has already been taken care of, so they "build on the foundation" and seek further improvements with various extremely preferential facilities. In our country, the minimum living standards of children cannot yet be maintained, so it is of course impossible to talk about even more preferential treatment for the time being. The more we admire and admire the affluence of children's lives in other countries, the more we should avoid adopting the methods of other countries without discrimination, allowing a few children to enjoy exclusive preferential treatment while the majority of children cannot maintain even the minimum living standards. What we should strive for first and foremost is to ensure that children across the country can eat enough, wear enough, and maintain the minimum standard of living; to ensure that children across the country can receive the minimum amount of compulsory education; and to ensure that the physical and mental health of children across the country have the minimum amount of protection, free from all natural or man-made harm. These are the most urgent tasks. All other children's welfare undertakings, before these things are accomplished, are merely the privilege of a few children, merely luxuries, merely icing on the cake, and can be carried out slowly. This principle of prioritizing what is urgent and important is actually very simple. However, we seem to have not paid enough attention to it in the past when promoting Children's Day and carrying out children's welfare undertakings. Our work seems to have been focused on allowing a portion of children who already have superior opportunities to enjoy even more fully, while neglecting the majority of children who do not have even the minimum guarantee of happiness. Even with regard to all the implementations of last year's Children's Year, how many of them benefited the general public rather than being limited to a small number of children? Toy exhibitions? For children who don't have enough to eat or wear, toys are a luxury. Displays of reading materials? For children who have no opportunity to learn to read, all reading materials are equally meaningless. The establishment of the Capital Children's Education Center? That is even more the privilege of a very small number of children. These works, after the general children have the minimum happiness, all have the value of promoting, but in the current situation, it seems that it is not the most urgent task. We want to "send charcoal in the snow," we don't want to "add flowers to the brocade."</p>
<p>In addition, I can give another example of paying attention to children's happiness while neglecting the priority. In recent years, because of imitating foreign systems, kindergartens and nurseries and other institutions have had a gradually spread tendency in China. Raising the age at which children receive education is an ideal approach. But let's not forget that 70% or more of compulsory education-aged children still do not have a school to attend. We really have no time to promote this education before compulsory education. And in fact, except in rural and industrial areas, because women work in the fields and factories, they especially need these agencies for educating and raising young children, there is no need for them at all in ordinary cities. In ordinary cities, most of the children who go to kindergarten or nursery schools come from middle-class families. In such families, mothers should be responsible for education and nurturing. Kindergarten or nursery school equipment simply relieves mothers of their responsibilities and increases the burden on society, and these mothers are not seen to be able to take the time to do other things that are beneficial to society. Under such circumstances, are these education and nurturing institutions aimed at increasing the happiness of children not another luxury? Why don't we move the funds for running these institutions to promote the desperately needed compulsory primary schools?</p>
<p>The above examples are only used to illustrate that children's welfare undertakings should be handled with priority. Although there is a meaning of seeking perfection when dealing with children's welfare undertakings, the good intentions and enthusiasm of the operators are still worthy of admiration. However, I hope that everyone will think more about guaranteeing the minimum happiness of children across the country in the future. We want everyone to work hard to ensure that children across the country can eat enough, wear enough, and maintain the minimum standard of living; that they can universally enjoy the minimum amount of compulsory education; and that they can receive the minimum amount of protection in terms of law, morality, and medicine, so that their bodies and minds are not harmed in any way. If we have a penny for the facilities for children's welfare undertakings, we should use it in these areas first; if we have a point of strength, we should also use it in these areas first. When these minimum happinesses are realized, we will seek to improve and increase them, so that all the children in our country will be as happy as the children in the United States and other advanced countries in the future. This is the proper way to commemorate Children's Day. Finally, let me take this opportunity to bless the children of the motherland and pay tribute to all those who love children.</p>
<h3>The United States Sincerely Assists the Philippines in Nation-Building</h3>
<p>Balancing Political Independence and Economic Freedom, and Will Sign Neutrality Treaties with Various Countries</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The new U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, passed through here today on his way to Manila to assume his new post. McNutt told reporters that the U.S. does not intend to throw the Philippines to the wolves. The U.S. government will do its best to give the island a good start. McNutt did not specify who the wolves were, nor did he mention the possibility of a war in the Far East, only saying that after he took office in the Philippines, he would conduct Philippine affairs with sincerity and enthusiasm. (Guomin Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Sacramento The new U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, gave a speech at the California State Legislature here today, stating that the Philippines must achieve economic freedom before it can achieve political independence. The steps towards Philippine independence have already passed the initial stage, but there are still many unresolved issues that need to be addressed. It is wise for the U.S. to grant the Philippines a large degree of autonomy during the transition period to independence. Although the U.S. can still exercise sovereignty over the Philippines, its policy is not only to avoid interference but also to assist the new government with sincerity and cooperation as the Philippine government exercises its autonomous power in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Independence Act and the Philippine Constitution. As for the important issues to be considered for the future of the Philippines, neutrality treaties are one of them; U.S.-Philippine trade relations are another; and economic adjustments before Philippine independence are a third. In view of the Philippine people's ability to be independent and autonomous and to cherish democratic systems, we deeply hope that they will continue to strive for liberalism and autonomous governance and will not betray our expectations. (Guomin Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Philippine President Quezon is currently engaged in trade negotiations with the United States and does not insist on an early independence for the Philippines. This issue will likely be resolved only after the U.S.-Philippine commercial relationship is decided. At the same time, many in the U.S. Congress favor an early withdrawal from the Philippines, but the Army and Navy are opposed to drastic action. Therefore, a compromise must now be sought between the politicians who favor withdrawing from the Philippines next year and the military officials who advocate maintaining the original plan. (Reuters Telegraph from the Central News Agency on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Quezon Speaks on the Philippine National Defense Plan</h3>
<p>Not Intended for U.S. War Against Japan, but to Protect People's Progress</p>
<p>Ambassador Shi Hosts Quezon</p>
<p>[New York] Philippine President Quezon gave a speech here today to the Foreign Policy Association, strenuously denying that the United States intends to form a powerful force in the Philippines for future use in a war against Japan, saying that the Philippine national defense plan is purely to create good and useful citizens who can become brave and skilled warriors when necessary, so that the Philippines will not be occupied without any resistance. The Philippines is now training a large professional army, but it can be called a citizen army, a peaceful army of progress, civilization, and improving the lives of our people. Outside rumors that the U.S. government selected General MacArthur as the head of the U.S. military advisory group in the Philippines, in fact, for the U.S. to deploy military forces against Japan in the Philippines, this is not true. The appointment of General MacArthur to the Philippines came from my recommendation, which proves that our national defense plan is not to strengthen U.S. power but to strengthen the position of the Philippines. Moreover, if the U.S. wanted to attack Japan, it would have done so years ago and would not have waited until today. As for the Philippine military strength, including the police, it is at most only 10,000 people, while its population is over 15 million. If the Philippine national defense plan is compared with Switzerland, no one would want to call Switzerland a military country. What is the difference with the Philippines? (Guomin Telegraph on the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Philippine President Quezon expressed his views on his trip to Mexico today, saying that the Philippines wants to establish friendly cultural relations with the countries of the Americas, but he did not mention that the Philippines would join the Pan-American Union and establish diplomatic relations with the countries of the Americas. (Guomin Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji hosted a banquet today to entertain Philippine President Quezon. Guests invited to attend also included U.S. Secretary of War Woodring, Undersecretary of State Moore, U.S. military advisor to the Philippines MacArthur, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department Hornbeck, Director of the Bureau of Insular Affairs Cox, many U.S. Senators and Representatives, and the entire Quezon delegation. The event was grand and lively. The Chairman of the American Textile Association, Murchison, also visited Quezon today. (Guomin Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Germany Implements New Regulations to Control Steel</h3>
<p>To Complete Military Preparations Plan</p>
<p>[Berlin] General Göring, Commissioner of the Four-Year Economic Plan, announced today that new steel control regulations will be implemented from May 1st. He stated that these regulations are related to the Four-Year Plan, as the implementation of Germany's military preparations plan is necessary. The intention is to reduce competition among steel consumers and align consumption with national productivity. Industries related to military preparations will enjoy priority in obtaining supplies.</p>
<h3>Another Economic Policy of President Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Restraining Heavy Industry and Promoting Consumer Goods to Ensure an Even Distribution of National Economy</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt declared today that the US government will shift revival and relief funds from heavy industry to consumer goods to ensure an even distribution of the national economy and to curb the rising prices of steel, copper, and other heavy industrial products. He said that high prices are a dangerous sign, and the result will be the bankruptcy of both light and heavy industries' consumption. Relief projects will focus on dredging and building reservoirs, while projects requiring heavy industrial materials, such as building steel bridges and cement canals, will be temporarily postponed. The price of steel has risen by six dollars per ton compared to last month. Compared to wages in the steel industry, the price of steel is too expensive. The price of copper has also risen by seventeen cents per pound. According to experts, the production of heavy industrial products has exceeded the consumption of consumer goods in recent months. (National Telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt recently announced that he will submit a message to Congress in the middle of this month, requesting funds to relieve unemployed workers. He will also propose the 1937-38 budget expenditure figures in the message. When asked what kind of nature the unemployment relief funds will have, the President immediately explained the government's price policy, stating briefly that these funds will be used to increase the purchase volume of various consumer goods. As for certain raw materials whose prices have risen too quickly, while the prices of consumer goods made from them have not risen accordingly, their purchase volume will be restricted. The president said that if the prices of consumer goods cannot keep up with the prices of raw materials, the production of both consumer goods and raw materials will decrease, and the number of unemployed people will increase. Therefore, the federal government should now find ways to curb the rise in raw material prices and encourage the purchase of consumer goods as much as possible, so that the prices of the two will gradually approach each other. Referring to the recent price increases in copper and iron, the President said that the rate of price increases is far higher than the rate of wage increases in the copper and iron industries. The reason for this is that the United Kingdom has purchased large quantities of copper and iron. It is estimated that the quantity purchased by the United Kingdom in recent months is worth about 50 million US dollars. The President finally said, "The US government has no other way to control prices except to find ways to do so in its own government budget expenditures."

<h3>US Labor Strikes</h3>
<p>Although the Coal Mine Situation is Resolved, Ford Factory Workers are on Strike Again</p>
<p>Detroit: Local union leaders today have advised striking workers to withdraw from nine Chevrolet automobile factories, and said that after the Chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization, Lewis, meets with the Chairman of Chrysler Automobile Factory, Chrysler, tomorrow, workers will be able to return to work next Monday. Lewis, originally the president of the coal miners' union, arrived here today to preside over the final negotiations of the General Motors labor strike immediately after signing a contract with mine owners in New York yesterday. In addition, 2,500 workers at the Ford Motor Factory in Kansas City have also announced a strike, so the Ford Motor Factory union movement will follow after the completion of the General Motors factory union movement. (National Telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>[New York] The US coal mining industry strike, involving 462,000 miners, has been resolved today. Representatives from both mine owners and the miners' union signed a new wage and working hours contract tonight, with a term of two years. It stipulates that daily wages will be increased by 50 cents per day, and wages calculated by the ton will be increased by 9 cents per ton. Overtime work will be paid an additional 50 percent of the wage, and the weekly working hours will be 35 hours. This is a compromise solution, as the miners initially requested a 30-hour work week, while the mine owners wanted 40 hours. Both parties will organize a mixed committee to study the difficult problem of miners losing their jobs due to the mechanization of the mining industry. The miners are scheduled to return to work on Monday. In addition, 122,000 automobile workers, 11,500 tire workers, and 5,000 other workers are unemployed today due to work stoppages. Representatives from both labor and management in the automobile industry held a meeting today to resolve the General Motors factory strike, but the discussion did not yield results and has now broken down.

<h3>US Takes a Reserved Attitude Towards Convening a World Economic Conference</h3>
<p>There is Even Less Hope for a Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>[London] It was learned today that the International Sugar Production Conference here may become a medium for British-American cooperation to promote world peace. It is heard that the person pulling the strings behind this plan is MacDonald in the Privy Council, who will meet with US Special Envoy Davis in a few days. According to reliable sources, a world economic conference may be revived, and it may even merge with the disarmament conference. (National Telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt today confirmed Secretary of State Hull's statement that the United States does not intend to initiate a world economic conference. Rumors that the United States is about to propose "important and surprising" proposals are entirely "fabrications by the newspapers." (National Telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] It is rumored that President Roosevelt intends to convene an international economic conference or limit armaments, and that Davis, the former US representative to the Disarmament Conference, will go to Europe to propose this plan to European countries. President Roosevelt recently denied the above news, and said that the declaration issued by Secretary of State Hull yesterday was his own opinion. According to Hull, "What the United States hopes for is that the main principles determined at the Pan-American Conference in Argentina last year will be maintained. The principles are: First, respect international laws and regulations; second, restore the normal state of the world economy; and third, countries do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. If all countries are interested in and express interest in these principles, then it is possible to consider convening an international conference." (Havas Telegram from Central News Agency on the 2nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the convening of an international economic conference and a disarmament conference, after President Roosevelt denied it, responsible officials recently stated that according to the US diplomatic community, with the European situation as it is, there is no room for convening a disarmament conference. In addition, the US government is focusing all its efforts on dealing with the judicial system reform bill and labor disputes and has no time for other matters. Regarding the disarmament issue, the only positive action that the United States can take at present is for Davis, the chief representative of the International Sugar Industry Conference, to investigate the armament situation of European countries. As for the international economic conference, it is still far off. This conference must be carefully considered in advance, and Davis can hold talks with European authorities to prepare for future steps. (Havas Telegram from Central News Agency on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Indian Authorities Prepare for Elections</h3>
<p>Efforts are Now Being Made to Prepare</p>
<p>Bombay: Today is the day when British India implements autonomy in accordance with the new constitution. Except for minor incidents and the arrest of several people in Mumbai, Delhi, and Patna, it has passed peacefully. The boycott has now spread widely. One of its characteristics is that although the President of the All-India Muslim League has asked Muslims not to participate in this move, the majority of Muslims have risen up in response, which is unexpected. Today, large crowds gathered in various cities and towns, but these people obeyed the call of the Indian National Congress and strictly maintained order, without causing any incidents. It is believed that all developments will depend on the attitude of the Congress leader Gandhi. The provincial governments formed by the Congress Party and minority parties all believe that the authorities in the six provinces where the Congress Party holds a majority will order new elections to be held within six months. Both parties are now working hard to prepare in order to win more support from the people. According to various circles in the Congress Party, regardless of whether new elections will be held, and regardless of whether the governors decide to abandon the parliament and implement the special rights of governance, the Congress Party's views on the issue of assuming office will not be divided.

<h3>Mediation Movement for the Spanish Civil War</h3>
<p>Mexico Initiates; Cuba Responds</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Mexican government recently sent a note to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, proposing that the member states of the League of Nations jointly find ways to end the Spanish Civil War as soon as possible. This proposal was subsequently accepted by the Cuban government. People from various American countries here commented that the American countries' intervention in the Spanish Civil War will not become a reality, at least in the recent period, and said that the Mexican government's note did not specify that the American countries should act as mediators, but only made a suggestion to all member states of the League of Nations in empty terms. However, since Mexico has this suggestion and Cuba has seconded it, it can create a psychological state that may allow the American countries to come forward to mediate the Spanish Civil War in the future.

<h3>The Little Entente Countries Decide on a Common Attitude</h3>
<p>Expressing Satisfaction with the Italian-Yugoslav Agreement; Still Supporting the League of Nations and Allied Countries</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: The Standing Political Conference of the three Little Entente countries was held here yesterday and lasted for two days. It closed this afternoon and immediately issued a lengthy communiqué, which is divided into eleven sections. Only a few sections describe the attitude of the three Little Entente countries towards current international issues, while the remaining sections elaborate on the various important principles of the three countries' general policies, stating that the three countries have confidence and completely agree on the above principles. As for the attitude towards current issues, the most important ones include the following four items:</p>
<p>㊀ Expressing satisfaction with the recent political and economic agreement signed between Italy and Yugoslavia, and believing that the agreement will not hinder Yugoslavia's obligations to the Czech Republic and Romania.</p>
<p>㊁ The three Little Entente countries declare that they will not participate in any ideological combination formed due to the different domestic political systems of each country.</p>
<p>㊂ The three Little Entente countries declare that they will continue to be loyal to the League of Nations, France, and the Balkan Entente countries.</p>
<p>㊃ Hoping to quickly sign the new Locarno Treaty and lay the foundation for peace in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The communiqué did not mention the restoration of the Habsburg former royal family in Austria. The first paragraph of the communiqué states that the recent international situation has improved and the world economy has been revived, and that the policies of the three Little Entente countries can continue to develop within the scope of the Little Entente Convention of February 16, 1933. Then, a principle is put forward, stating that the security of each country itself is absolutely interconnected and inseparable. "Therefore, European countries must establish a complete security system and include all regions where security is a problem. For this reason, the three Little Entente countries sincerely hope that the negotiations currently being conducted by major powers will yield results, so as to establish a new Locarno Treaty and consolidate the foundation of peace in Central and Eastern Europe."</p>
<p>As for the Spanish issue, the communiqué stated that "The three Little Entente countries should strictly implement the various measures recommended by the London Adjustment Committee. Thereafter, the three Little Entente countries should immediately accept all new attempts aimed at making the non-interference method of the Spanish civil war effective." The only specific issue mentioned in the communiqué is the treaty signed between Italy and Yugoslavia, stating that this treaty has a practical effect on maintaining peace, so it is natural that it will not hinder the mutually binding obligations of the three Little Entente countries. The last section of the communiqué puts on record the work of the 8th and 9th sessions of the Little Entente countries' economic conference, and states that the Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente countries has also decided on the direction of the three countries' future economic activities. (Havas Telegram from Central News Agency on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: When the Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente countries opened this afternoon, it was Czech Foreign Minister Kroschda who read the official communiqué. After the words were finished, Romanian Foreign Minister Endonesco gave a speech, praising the unity of opinion among the three Little Entente countries, which shows that the Little Entente Treaty is currently thriving and the political, economic, and financial relations among the Little Entente countries have greatly developed. (Havas Telegram from Central News Agency on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: After the closing of the Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente countries, Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović hosted a grand banquet last night, and gave a speech at the banquet, briefly saying that the results obtained at this session can make those who trust the Little Entente more and more believe, and others who doubt the Little Entente or do not understand the goals of the Little Entente will also know what to do. Czech Foreign Minister Krofta replied that the solidarity and unity of the three Little Entente countries has been reconfirmed by this session.

<h3>British Labor Party Leader Scheduled to Visit Germany</h3>
<p>To Meet with Hitler</p>
<p>[London] Opposition Labor Party leader Lansbury is now scheduled to go to Berlin on the 17th of this month and visit German leader Hitler on the 19th to hold talks. Lansbury recently issued a declaration to our reporter, saying, "I have previously visited the United States to visit President Roosevelt, and then visited Scandinavian Peninsula countries, France, Belgium, and other countries to visit politicians from those countries. This visit to Germany is just a continuation of previous visits. As for my visits to politicians from various countries to hold private talks, the purpose is to discuss a problem. I have repeatedly raised this problem in the House of Commons in the past, which is the 'economic causes' of war. I must explore the root of the scourge of war in order to eradicate it. There is no doubt that this root is mostly in the economic aspect. What I want to know now is whether it is possible for the major powers to hold a joint meeting to study using economic methods to solve political difficulties. I think if countries can freely purchase raw materials, all countries' markets are open equally, and an international organization is established for the world market, all of these are methods to eliminate war. What I want to explore with politicians from various countries is this." (Havas Telegram from Central News Agency on the 2nd)</p>

<h3>Conflict Between Tianjin Japanese Yu Feng Cotton Mill and Stevedore Guild</h3>
<p>Several Hundred People Gathered, Preparing for a Major Armed Fight; Japanese Side Conspired to Destroy Flag to Frame Others</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Japanese Yu Feng Cotton Mill, located on the north bank of the Hai River in Special District Four, occupies more than 200 acres. It is solely operated by the Japanese Toyo Cotton Spinning Company. The first factory was originally scheduled to start operation on April 1st, but due to insufficient preparation, it was postponed to May 1st. The factory has a total of 50,000 spindles and 1,000 looms, all shipped from Japan to Tianjin. All machinery, furniture, and textile materials have been continuously unloaded from ships into the factory in recent days. According to Tianjin's custom, the unloading of goods is handled by stevedore guilds. Historically, Tianjin stevedore guilds have each demarcated their boundaries for hundreds of years, without encroaching on each other. Stevedore guilds within the boundaries are registered with the Social Affairs Bureau and hold licenses. Those who intentionally encroach often gather crowds for bloodshed, even engaging in major armed fights involving hundreds of people to争 the business territory. However, since the Social Affairs Bureau stipulated registration measures, such fights have ceased. The leader of the stevedore guild in Special District Four, where the Yu Feng Cotton Mill is located, is named Wu Yongsheng. He has gathered more than 200 stevedores and is engaged in unloading import and export goods from the Hai River. He is also legally registered with the Social Affairs Bureau and holds a license. According to custom, the loading and unloading of goods at the Yu Feng Cotton Mill should be the responsibility of Wu Yongsheng's stevedore guild. However, Zhang Fengsan, the personnel section chief of the factory, disregarded the established practice and entrusted a man named Liu Wanyuan to form a new stevedore guild specifically for handling the factory's loading and unloading matters, recruiting more than 100 laborers. In mid-March, they started working. Wu Yongsheng immediately approached the Yu Feng Cotton Mill with reason, but the factory was initially very rude. Fearing disputes, all the machinery and other goods that were shipped were changed to be docked at the Japanese International Transportation Wharf in Dazhigu, Hai River, and transported into the Yu Feng Cotton Mill by heavy-duty trucks of the Japanese International Transportation Company. In this way, the local stevedore guild could not interfere, but the round trip was long, the freight was too high, and the factory did not find it cost-effective. Therefore, from March 28th, regardless of the local stevedore guild, they continued to unload in Special District Four by their own new stevedore guild. Wu Yongsheng, the leader of the local stevedore guild, argued that the business was being encroached upon, affecting the livelihoods of hundreds of laborers. He again questioned the factory, but the result was not satisfactory. In order to reach a concrete conclusion, the old and new stevedore guilds each gathered hundreds of people, prepared for a fight with sticks and iron rulers, all ready. The fight was scheduled for the 29th. On the new stevedore guild side, the Japanese side prepared many Japanese national flags, intending to destroy the flags after the fight in order to provoke negotiations and escalate the situation. The police department learned of the matter, fearing bloodshed in the fight, mutual injuries, and unnecessary disputes. They urgently dispatched 200 armed security team members to suppress the situation and telegraphed the Japanese police station to order the Yu Feng Cotton Mill to stop the riot of the new stevedore guild. Based on the report from the local stevedore guild Wu Yongsheng, the Social Affairs Bureau sent Bai Dianhua, the director of the Labor Division, and Zhang Shijin, a staff member, to the Yu Feng Cotton Mill on the morning of the 31st to investigate the truth and conduct mediation. The Japanese side put forward three requests: ⑴ The factory has the right to freely entrust the stevedore guild for the loading and unloading of goods entering and leaving the factory. ⑵ The local stevedore guild Wu Yongsheng should write a letter of repentance, admitting that the action was unreasonable. ⑶ The goods entering the factory should be transported by the local stevedore guild, and the factory will entrust the new stevedore guild to handle the goods leaving the factory, and the local stevedore guild shall not interfere. For the sake of business interests, Wu Yongsheng requested the Social Affairs Bureau to uphold its prestige and persist to the end. The matter is being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau, but the Japanese conditions are very harsh and may be difficult to accept. The two sides are still deadlocked, and hundreds of laborers are sharpening their fists, ready to fight. According to investigations, the stevedore guild territory is a hereditary system. They守 their boundaries, and this has not changed for hundreds of years. In October of last year, the Social Affairs Bureau conducted stevedore guild registration, adjusted the city's stevedore guilds, issued licenses, and allowed them to operate legally. This time, the Yu Feng Cotton Mill wants to set up its own stevedore guild, which is truly unexpected. If it is allowed to be an exception, others will follow suit. There are many Japanese industrial and commercial enterprises in Tianjin, and the loading and unloading affairs are very繁. If they all set up their own stevedore guilds, breaking the previous boundaries, it will not only affect the prestige of the Social Affairs Bureau, but also lead to bloodshed in the fight for stevedore guild business, one after another, with no peaceful days. As it concerns local public security, the municipal government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau on the morning of the 1st to properly handle the matter, so as not to allow the dispute to spread and avoid potential hidden dangers.

<h3>Southern Travel Glimpses (3)</h3>
<p>— Junbao</p>
<p>The spiritual life of Malaysians has entertainment. The instruments are similar to those in China, with rough construction and simple tones. Gongs and drums are the same as in China; the zither is similar to the huqin; there is also an instrument made of a number of wooden or copper plates, from left to right, the length of the plates increases sequentially, slightly similar to the form of an organ, and different tones are produced by striking them with a hammer.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of dances. Several kinds can be seen in an amusement park, but the movements are simple, only advancing and retreating back and forth, left and right, with very little expression. Dramas are mostly about love between men and women and stories of gods and monsters.</p>
<p>Their superstition is the deepest. It is animism, and everywhere is filled with the terror of superstition. However, many places are similar to China, but it is indeed more deeply rooted than Chinese superstition. Mountains, rivers, grass, trees, and the corpses of animals are all believed to be possessed by ghosts and gods, not to mention the dead. They regard diseases, death, and various unfortunate events as the work of ghosts and gods. Especially for those who practice witchcraft and magic, they dare not violate them with greater holiness. It is said that witchcraft is a profession that uses magic and can manipulate all kinds of blessings, misfortunes, good and bad luck. It can not only treat diseases, predict 君 咎, but also avenge people.</p>
<p>Most Malays believe in Islam. Every Friday, they go to the mosque to read the Koran Koren, so Friday is considered the holy day. The Koran is a treasure for self-cultivation and family harmony. Although they believe in Islam, they are still very superstitious about all natural things.</p>
<p>The class between men and women is very deep. When a woman walks in front of a man, she can only bow her body and walk quickly, and is not allowed to walk upright with her chest out. To give something to a man, she must kneel forward, which is the same as Japanese customs.</p>
<p>They carry heavy and light objects on their heads, not on their shoulders, unless the overseas Chinese teach them to carry them.</p>
<p>Malay Muslims must hold a most solemn ceremony when they are young, that is, both underage boys and girls must have their foreskin of the penis cut off for boys, and the labia minora for girls, and a little of each must be removed. This is a major ceremony in their lives. Otherwise, they will be looked down upon by their peers.</p>
<p>Weddings and celebrations and when nobles go out, umbrellas must be raised, and the umbrellas have different levels, similar to the situation in China before.</p>
<p>The funerals of Malays are cremated or buried in straw. A stone tablet is erected at each end of the tomb, the man's tombstone is cylindrical, and the woman's 長方形.</p>
<h3>Dayak People of Borneo</h3>
<p>The cruel practice of headhunting still prevails among the natives of Borneo and New Guinea. The natives of New Guinea are completely naked. Women only use shells or coconut leaves to cover their陰部 or paint patterns all over their bodies. They pierce their noses with pig bones or fish bones, similar to cow noses, and pull them out when eating. On both sides of the nose凖, two bones are pierced from the upper end, and a bone is inserted horizontally from the left and right of the nose, just like an African native inserting a round board horizontally. It is a similar strange custom to make it protrude outward.</p>
<p>According to A. R. Wallace, the races of Southeast Asia can be divided into two major schools: the inhabitants of the Malay Archipelago are the Malay race, and the inhabitants of New Guinea and other islands are the Papuan race, because they are fundamentally different in terms of physique, spirit, and morality. In recent years, the opinions of most anthropologists generally divide the ethnic groups of the Southeast Asian archipelago into four systems, namely:</p>
<p>1. Negrito race - (Semang, Sakai)</p>
<p>2. Vedda race - (Ceylon people)</p>
<p>3. Pure Malay race</p>
<p>4. Mixed-race Malay race</p>
<p>I will not go into detail about the various issues of these races for the time being. Now, I will briefly record the exploration of the origin of the Malay race: There are several speculations about the origin of the Malay race: (1) Anthropologists believe that it comes from Asia. All the races scattered east of the Ganges River, up to New Guinea, are related. According to scholars, before Borneo and Sumatra were separated by the ocean, these two places were the residence of the Malay and Proto-Malay races. (2) Before the Malay islands were separated by the ocean, there was a race completely different from the Malay race, as well as the Proto-Malay race, the mixed-race Malay race, etc. (3) Korn believed that the homeland of the Malays was ancient婆Clarnpa, Cochin-China, Campooia, etc. (4) According to the linguistic aspect, the Malay race may have come from the area between India and China. (5) The Proto-Malays may be a mixed race similar to the Mongoloid race (see my translation of the Malay race in the fourth issue of the fifth volume of the Journal of Southeast Asian Studies). Many anthropologists have painstakingly studied the races of the Southeast Asian archipelago, but due to the incompleteness of the collection of anthropological materials, there is no consensus.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Salt Merchants Petition Twice to Withdraw Tax Increase Order</h3>
<p>The Price of Daily Edible Salt Has More Than Doubled; Tens of Thousands of Salt Merchants Have Gone on Strike and Lost Their Jobs</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Guangdong Province increased the additional salt tax per catty and implemented the Guangdong salt sales in Hunan method, the salt merchants have unanimously gone on strike and stopped配運. As a result, there has been a shortage of salt in Guangzhou for the past month, leading to successive increases in salt prices. The usual price of edible salt is just over one角 per catty, but since the salt merchants went on strike, the price has risen to three角 per catty. As salt is a daily necessity, all industries that use salt on a daily basis, such as salted fish stalls, salted goods stores, and cured meat stores, have been greatly affected. Because these stores use salt as the main raw material for manufacturing, the high price of salt increases costs, and goods are not easy to sell, resulting in losses. As for the salt merchants, because they stopped 配運, daily expenses and wages are still paid as usual, so they have also suffered great losses since the strike. The tax authorities have also seen a significant reduction in tax revenue in the past ten days due to the merchants' cessation of salt transport. Therefore, if this case is not resolved one day, the people will suffer and the public and private sectors will be in trouble. The future is really unimaginable. Salt industry工商 has been unable to bear the losses from such a long-term shutdown and has petitioned the authorities twice. On the 27th, representatives such as Chen Shoubai, who were representatives from the Upper and Lower River Salt Industry Association, the 民船 Guild, and various salt yards, were sent to the Liangguang Salt Transport Commissioner's Office to petition, detailing the difficulties in implementing the tax increase and the Hunan sales method, and requesting that they be abolished separately to relieve the困 of the merchants and maintain the people's livelihood. Commissioner Tang Xuan replied separately, saying that the two methods were implemented by order of the Ministry and that he would转 the difficulties of the business arena to the Ministry of Finance for review and requested that the representatives wait quietly for instructions. The petition representatives then withdrew and prepared a memorial to petition Chairman Lin of the National Government directly on the 28th,井 handing over the memorial. At that time, Chairman Lin comforted the salt merchants. The case was转ed to the competent authority for handling. The appendix is as follows: "It was reported on February 6 this year that the Liangguang Salt Transport Commissioner's Office posted a notice,转ing the Ministry of Finance's song telegram, roughly opening, 'Now the Guangdong Provincial Government plans to increase salt tax and allocate the funds for the Guangmei Railway public debt fund.' According to the audit office, the Guangdong tax rate is lighter than that of Huai salt, the Guangdong-Han Road has convenient transportation, and various corrupt taxes have been eliminated, so the salt cost has been reduced, and the tax should be increased to avoid encroachment on neighboring provinces. Based on the foregoing, it is proposed to increase the salt tax by one dollar and two milli七仙 per color洋, which can increase revenue by more than two million three hundred thousand annually, which can be allocated for the road debt fund,' etc., which have been转ed to the Guangdong工商 leak, etc.,奉命 bewildered and did not know what to do. I念 that the Guangmei Railway is a state-owned enterprise and should be the responsibility of all the people. Even if construction requires money, it should be considered in a unified manner. In this case, the fund cannot be solely burdened by the salt industry. Moreover, although the 陋 Rules have been eliminated, the cost of rectification is then levied, which is more than increased. It is improper to increase the levy on the grounds of reducing costs and considering encroachment. Moreover, since the Hunan sales of Guangdong salt have been levied with a unified tax in recent years, short sales have plummeted. Even without this tax increase, it is difficult to avoid沈沦. It is not appropriate to have the opportunity to rush to sell even if one is unable to manage oneself. If it is said that酌加 the tax rate does not hinder the official sales in this province, it is not a theory that knows the origin. Guangdong 洋界 is connected to the four provinces of Lian and Gui, and Guangdong Hua is adjacent to the private salt irrigation. If the levy is increased, the private梟 will become more prosperous, the impact of which will inevitably lead to a short tax collection and a loss of jobs for salt民, which is not only a high昂 food for the people, but also a困 to the工商, etc. (omitted in the middle) We工商漏, etc., hundreds of thousands of people, have now had no work to do, no industry to operate, and are waiting to die. The opportunity is危迫. We have sent representatives to pay homage to Chongjie, and we implore you to念 our suffering,矜 whole 格外,迅 饬 The Ministry of Finance should care for the people's livelihood and food and withdraw the tax increase order, and abolish the Hunan sales harsh covenant to use解倒悬. I can't help but wait for orders in a state of panic. (March 28th)"</p>

<h3>Securities: 96 Soars by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Rumors of a reorganization; the market has already become dispersed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange's market situation was slightly volatile, with signs of sluggishness. Due to the shaking of the multi-party front, it was temporarily difficult to cheer up. However, 96 was like a raging storm, surging endlessly, and soaring throughout the day. Although there was a setback in the middle, which seemed to have a downward trend, it still rose thanks to the strong pull. Investigating the reasons for its rise, initially the multi-party used Kodama's economic cooperation to manipulate it. Yesterday, it was said that Special Envoy Kong's foreign speech mentioned that China's old debts would be reorganized. Speculators took the opportunity to manipulate it. However, as for the so-called reorganization of old debts, it is not known whether it includes the 96 public bonds. Bondholders have not yet made any requests. The Japanese gold portion is still hopeless. The market rumors that 10,000 of 96 can be exchanged for 2,000 of the Renaissance Public Bonds are completely fabricated. Even if it is realized, it is only worth 14 yuan. Moreover, it is just a trick of speculators, so the market price is bound to collapse, and in the end, the general followers will suffer. Yesterday, after the opening, the highs and lows of each public bond were only two or three corners. Large households were still selling. 96 then rose wildly again, soaring by one yuan to one and a half yuan. 13, 34, and 52 vigorously bought in. The Northern Gang took advantage of the high to come out. In the secondary market, each bond market was still uneven, with ups and downs ranging from five cents to four corners. 96 actually rose again to 14 and a half yuan, soaring by one yuan and three corners. Therefore, the Northern Gang sold frantically in the forward market, resulting in a huge backwardation. As a result, it only rose by five cents. After the opening in the afternoon, each bond still did not fluctuate much, and 96 was raised again. 5 and 34 continued to buy, and 14, 35, 51, and 59, etc., sold extremely heavily. The market price was still very firm. At the close, each bond was mostly small. Type A and B were slightly firmer. In addition to the slight improvement of 5 cents in the current month, the rest continued to be small by five cents, one corner to three or four corners. Only 96 rose wildly by more than two yuan, and the deformed situation was rare. The total number of transactions was 21,035,000 yuan, with 96 accounting for more than 11 million yuan. The comparison table of the ups and downs is listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan):</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: The Rising Trend of Cotton Yarn Becomes Stronger</h3>
<p>Dry Market Surface, Short Sellers Rush to Cover Positions, a Sharp Increase of 22.7 Yuan Compared to the Same Period Last Month</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the upward trend is becoming stronger. This is mainly due to the flourishing yarn sales recently. Factories are holding onto their stocks even tighter, which has aroused the activity of speculators. According to market rumors, a certain gentleman and the gold and securities groups have made large purchases, resulting in an unusually dry market surface. Yuda alone took in 19,000 bales, and the market continued to advance step by step. The yarn business is now slightly quiet, but the price for this month's futures is 22.7 yuan higher than the price on March 3.</p>
<p>Major Players in Closing Market Aggressively Buy. At the opening of the spot yarn market, the prices for each month showed a mixed picture. Due to the pullback in foreign cotton prices, most people expected a turnaround. Unexpectedly, after entering the market, the market price soared. This was because the current yarn stocks were tight, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions. It is said that a certain gentleman alone took in 20,000 bales of foreign spot yarn, resulting in the price for each month increasing by 1.5 to 2.3 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. At the opening of the afternoon session, there was a slight pullback in each month, falling by 0.7 to 1 yuan. However, Yuda and Changjue came in to support the market again, and the market price rebounded. By the third closing, the aggressive buying by the long side resulted in the price for each month increasing by another 0.14 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Senkang sold 5,200 bales, Jifeng sold 3,200 bales, Tongfu sold 1,100 bales, Juxing sold 1,400 bales, Gengfeng sold 5,700 bales, Xingchang sold 2,400 bales, Shenji sold 2,650 bales, Yicheng sold 1,450 bales, Dachangcheng sold 4,800 bales, Runkang sold 1,850 bales, Xiecheng sold 2,200 bales, Shengyuan sold 1,150 bales, Yongda sold 1,400 bales, Hengyi bought 6,500 bales, Yuda bought 15,000 bales, Jinchang bought 6,400 bales, Renfeng bought 1,500 bales, Changfeng bought 11,200 bales, Wangtaixing bought 1,600 bales, Hengchang bought 1,650 bales, and Fukang bought 1,750 bales. The highest and lowest market prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Current Sales are Less Than the Previous Day. The sales of current yarn were less than the previous day. It was found that all the groups bought a total of 1,454 bales throughout the day, and the selling price increased by 2 yuan. The purchase amount of each group is as follows:</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Price Increase is More Difficult</h3>
<p>The cotton market turned weak due to the decline in American cotton prices, and the spot price fell below the 15-cent mark again. In addition, most cotton merchants were in a short position, and some were still buying yarn and selling cotton. Therefore, the cotton market was softer than the yarn market. However, the inventory of each group has decreased, and the current cotton situation is tight.</p>
<p>Fortunately, There is Assistance From Spot Yarn. At the opening of the spot cotton market, the market atmosphere turned negative and the price for each month showed a downward trend because the American and Indian cotton markets both declined. After the second session, it was driven up by the yarn market. By the time of closing, it was still mediocre and not as strong as the yarn market. The results of the spot cotton showed that the price for each month fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. At the opening of the afternoon session, the market was very weak due to large players selling off. The second session was average. By the time of closing, the cotton market improved due to the rise in the yarn market. As a result, only the May contract rose by 5 cents, and the rest remained unchanged. It was found that Taixing sold 2,300 dan, Mingde sold 5,900 dan, Hengyi sold 9,800 dan, Juxing sold 2,200 dan, Yongda sold 2,600 dan, Yikang sold 2,300 dan, Wangtaixing sold 2,900 dan, Yuanxingchang sold 2,100 dan, Changhe sold 5,500 dan, Jifeng bought 4,100 dan, Meiji bought 2,000 dan, Dafu bought 3,200 dan, Yuda bought 6,800 dan, Jinchang bought 3,800 dan, Hexing bought 5,000 dan, Renfeng bought 2,900 dan, Yuanyi bought 3,100 dan, Changfeng bought 12,600 dan, Fukang bought 2,400 dan, Xinchang bought 2,400 dan, and Tonghe bought 1,700 dan. The comparison of the high and low prices for the day is shown below.</p>
<p>Current Cotton Sales Decline Slightly. The current cotton consumption is still quite significant, but it is rarer than the previous day.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Longs Closed in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Each month pulled back around 20 points.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the American cotton market, the publication's news was not good. Foreign merchants closed out their long positions in large quantities and turned to limit price selling. Each month fell by 14 to 24 points. The extension of the sale of mortgaged cotton and the current cotton shortage have again intensified. Subsequently, due to President Roosevelt's warning that inappropriate price increases would lead to huge cotton fields and most commodity prices and the stock market being weak, market prices continued to soften. However, industry insiders still absorbed it at low prices, and new speculators also bought. At closing, there was a slight short covering. It is estimated that spot prices fell by 19 points, and futures fell by 19 to 23 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 8 points, and futures fell by 7-8 points. Indian cotton fell due to a large number of settlements and large-scale resale by securities firms. However, the sales volume was absorbed by Japanese merchants and mainland exporters. It is estimated that Pingguoliang fell by 3 rupees, Aomula fell by 1.75 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 1.5 to 2.25 rupees. Original telegram recorded later (2nd telegram). According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 3rd day was that Bairoxi was 248.5 rupees, Pingguoliang was 201.5 rupees, both down 0.75 rupees, and Aomula was 237 rupees, down 1 rupee.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Current Cotton Yarn Rises 3-4 Yuan</h3>

<h3>Piece Goods: A Very Large Amount of Eastern Goods and Fine Cloth Were Offered</h3>
<p>Almost all transactions in the market are with Japanese factories. Four Gentlemen Brand Serge Increases by 7.5 Cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market continued to be strong, because the spot yarn near-month prices rose sharply, and the market sentiment was high. The road customer group had strong purchasing interest due to robust actual sales. The Tianjin group purchased a large quantity of eastern fine cloth and fine twill, with a total transaction volume of more than 5,000 pieces. Fine cloth mainly included Qingdao-produced Double Dragon Pearl, Flower and Bird, Happy Crane, and Swallow Joyful Dragon Gate brands. The Nanyang Shantou and Jiuwang groups also handled about 1,000 pieces. The Yunnan group's white goods and colored patterns were also well-received. The Qingdao group added more than 100 pieces of striped and plain government silk. The local dyeing factory purchased 200 pieces of Changzhou Linlong fine twill at a price of 8.45 yuan per piece. Other eastern piece goods, fine cloth, fine twill, market cloth, and gray cloth also totaled nearly 1,000 pieces. The price of fine cloth and fine twill continued to rise by 0.05 to 0.075 yuan per piece. Four Gentlemen brand serge jumped wildly by 0.075 yuan per yard, with the market price selling at 0.29 yuan per yard. The Japanese company Ito Yoko offered approximately 3,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill for June, July, and August, and Dongmian Xing offered more than 2,000 pieces, all of which were ordered by local industry counterparts. The market trend is particularly strong.</p>
<h3>Food: Distant Futures for Flour and Wheat are Especially Expensive.</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market prices for each month initially showed a flat and then rising trend. Regarding the quotation for foreign wheat, Chicago improved by 0.45 yuan, Canada improved by nearly 0.9 yuan, and Dalian improved by 0.47 yuan. When the prices were opened, due to the news that actual sales were still low, outside long positions settled with the market, so the market atmosphere was very flat and slightly weaker than the previous day. After the second session, trading in the current month turned light, with little fluctuation. The new flour for July and beyond saw a surge in outside buying interest, and market prices gradually increased. When the afternoon session opened, it was initially calm, but then inland factories suddenly started covering short positions, and the market atmosphere gradually became brisk. The long positions that had been settled became sluggish, so the prices gradually increased, rising by 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day. Although trading in the May contract was low, prices also followed suit. For July and beyond, since the factory selling was not overwhelming and the absorption was quite smooth, prices continued to increase by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. The current month's situation will temporarily remain stable if actual sales become active.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the market prices for each month were generally flat and stable. Trading in the current month was sluggish, and buyers and sellers mostly waited and watched. For June and July, the weather conditions were uncertain, and people's minds were unsettled. For August and September, outside long positions improved by 0.03 yuan. When the afternoon session opened, the current month improved by 0.01 yuan due to the improvement in the flour market. The June contract did not open. For July and beyond, due to the hedging of inland groups, there was a natural wait-and-see attitude regarding the changes in the new wheat that had not yet been seen. However, outside buyers still took in, so prices increased by another 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. The current wheat market is still stable. The opening price for imported Yanghe Yaowan wheat was 6.45 yuan, Jiangbei wheat was 6.33 yuan, Gaoyou wheat was 6.35-6.36 yuan, and Tiantai wheat was 6.21-6.22 yuan. Fuxin took 2,000 bags, and Shenda took 800 bags.</p>
<h3>The Sales of Japonica and Indica Rice are Flat</h3>
<p>The Market Will be Closed for the Qingming Festival for the Next Two Days.</p>
<p>Yesterday, about 20 boats from various sources arrived at the Nan Shi (South Market) with a total of 4,300-4,400 shi of Japonica rice. Thin paddy rice still accounted for the majority. The sales market in this area remained sluggish. The sales of packaged rice were similar to before. Except for Qingdao and other groups buying more than 2,000 bags of thin paddy rice, and Xi'an group buying 400-500 bags of thick Japonica rice, the situation was stable. The market price of thin paddy rice did not fluctuate. However, thick Japonica rice was slow-moving in this area. In addition, as the Spring Sweeping Festival was closed for 11 days today and tomorrow, sellers depreciated prices to seek sales, so the price finally fell by nearly a corner. Du Jian (a type of rice) also showed weakness, and Yang Jian (another type of rice) was similar, turning into mediocrity.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 21 or 22 boats from the Hexia passenger route arrived at the North Market. The sales of various types of rice in the market were flat in the morning. The price of white Japonica rice weakened by a few cents, falling to nearly a corner. In the afternoon, the purchasing enthusiasm of the stores improved, and the price stabilized. The price of top-quality thin paddy rice was flat, while the price of medium-quality rice fell by a few cents. The price of various rice types weakened by 0.07 to 0.08 yuan. The price of white Yuan rice weakened by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan. Due to the Spring Festival holiday, the market will be closed for two days today and tomorrow, and will reopen as usual on the 6th.</p>
<p>There were still shipments of passenger Indica rice arriving from various ports along the Yangtze River, but the sales were still lacking the patronage of passenger groups. The Quanzhou group only purchased a slightly more than 200 bags of Ji Yuan rice. The remaining Ji Cao Indica and Yuan rice were all purchased by local groups. The total sales for the day were 1,963 bags of Jiangxi rice, 100 bags of Zhenjiang machine-milled rice, 70 bags of Anqing machine-milled rice, and 150 bags of Taizhou Liu Indica rice. There were no other transactions. However, the market has stabilized. Due to the repeated declines in prices in recent days, the cargo owners were unwilling to reduce prices further, but they still lacked the determination to hold on. If there were sales channels, they would be willing to sell at the market price. However, due to the suspension of sales in Guangdong, there was a lack of outlets for large groups.</p>
<h3>Spot Soybean and Sesame Slightly Move</h3>
<p>The Futures Soybean Oil Cake Market is Flat</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the standard soybean oil cake market in the morning, the customer base watched and waited. The firms released slightly. The prices of both near and distant months saw a pullback. In the afternoon, the price of Dalian soybean futures stabilized, and the current soybeans in this area, factories, and Jiangbei all saw a slight increase in sales. The buying interest in Dalian soybeans turned active. At the close, the prices for April and June increased by 0.05 yuan, and the price for May increased by 0.03 yuan. The current sales of oil cakes were stagnant, and the market also lacked activity. The price of Dalian soybean oil remained similar to the previous day. With the weather being clear, there was considerable interest in Dalian soybean cake from customers, and the price increased by about 0.005 to 0.01 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot soybean market was not very exciting due to the Dalian market being closed, the weekend, and the Sweeping Festival. The prices did not fluctuate much. Only one truckload of Bengbu soybeans, one truckload of Linhuaiguan soybeans, one truckload of Sipingjie soybeans, 200 bags of Tancheng soybeans, 200 bags of Shashi soybeans, 300 bags of Shashi yellow soybeans, 100 bags of Zha soybeans, and foreign Zhuang sesame were traded. The foreign Zhuang sesame slightly improved, but the sales were still ordinary. Yesterday, only Western merchants purchased 25 tons at a price of 14.4 yuan. Due to the slight movement in foreign Zhuang, the spot raw sesame market was more active than the previous day. Shashi sesame has already opened at 11.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: A Review of the New York Silk Market</h3>
<p>- Silk Prices Soared in Mid-March -</p>
<p>New York Telegram. The New York raw silk situation in March was that reduced silk imports and robust clearings pushed prices sharply higher mid-month.

The statistics of New York raw silk in March are listed below to understand the situation of the overseas silk market this month.</p>
<h3>The Difference Between Domestic and Foreign Silk Prices is 20 Yuan</h3>

The New York Stock Exchange market saw a decline, with the recent price falling by 2.5 cents and the distant price falling by 2 cents. The current price of Japanese-Chinese silk was maintained as before. Sales of Central China silk were sluggish. The price of white factory 7-8 silk straight-reeled silk from foreign accounts was only 760 yuan, and Yangfan silk was 780 yuan, which was about 20 yuan different from the price held by domestic manufacturers and the sales price of users. It was difficult to conclude deals. India and France Zhuang were also quiet at the same time. Domestic sales were also only sporadic, it was said.</p>
<h3>Metals: Little Guangpi, Which Had Been Quiet for a Long Time, Suddenly Moved</h3>
<p>The trade of Little Guangpi had originally been very smooth, but recently the increased arrivals of vice-brand cigarette tinplate seriously affected its sales. The standard price gradually decreased, to the point of becoming unmanageable, at only about 12 yuan per dan. Its overseas fixed price had been at 15 pounds per ton, which, converted to the Shanghai market, would have sold for 15 yuan. However, the sell price of vice-brand cigarette tinplate was surprisingly cheap, which resulted in the market for Little Guangpi becoming uninteresting. In the last few days, Tianjin merchants suddenly showed interest, and the previously crowded market of vice-brand cigarette tinplate suddenly felt short. Little Guangpi, which had long been inactive, suddenly saw large transactions. It was discovered that there were 6-7 hundred cases being offered on the market, and the price skyrocketed to 14 yuan per dan, and even future deliveries were being ordered. It was completely different from before.</p>

The price of local factory refined white sugar Dahua No. 1 was 21.6 yuan, and grades 2, 3, 4, and 5 decreased by 0.2 yuan per grade.

It was also heard that there were several hundred bags of Gaoban Nanqing at 12.9 yuan, with some higher grade sugars previously offered at 13.55 to 12.3 yuan.</p>

<h3>North and South Goods: The Quanzhou Longan Prices Are Gradually Approaching</h3>

<h3>Mexican First Minister to China, Oggla, Arrived in Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>The embassy decided to set up offices in Beijing and Shanghai. It was said that the national conditions of China and Mexico are similar and should maintain good relations.</p>
<p>Mexico did not originally have an embassy in China, but it was established this year. The first minister to China is General Francisco J. Aguilar, who is also the minister to Japan. Mr. Aguilar came to China from Japan to take office, first visiting Beijing and staying for a week. He arrived in Shanghai at 7:40 yesterday morning by the Beijing-Shanghai train with his family. Zhao Tiezhang, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, Mr. Ormond, the First Secretary of the Embassy and Consul General in Beijing, Mr. Frisco, the Consul General in Shanghai, and others went to the North Railway Station to welcome him. Mr. Aguilar has a short beard and a burly figure, wearing a blue tweed suit and a beige thick woolen overcoat. Due to travel fatigue, he lost his voice. After getting off the train, he went to the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to rest. It is reported that the Mexican embassy has decided to set up offices in Beijing and Shanghai. The Shanghai office is temporarily located in the Claremont Hotel on Lafayette Road, and a new location is currently being sought for expansion. The Mexican Consulate in Shanghai will be moved in to work together. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Aguilar met with a reporter from the New Voice News Agency at the International Hotel and gave a speech saying that he was very happy to be appointed as the first minister to China. Although this was his first time in China, he had read many books on the political, economic, and historical geography of China, so he already had a considerable understanding of China. He said that China is a large country in Asia, and Mexico is also a large country in the Americas. The national conditions of the two countries are quite similar. For example, both countries have a democratic political system, and the Chinese Kuomintang and the Mexican Revolutionary Party have the same nature. During the revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen called for revolution in 1911, and Mr. Maders of our country formed the Revolutionary Party in 1910. Other provincial systems of the two countries are also very similar. Therefore, I believe that there is a high possibility of cooperation between China and Mexico, and my mission is to promote good relations between the two countries and promote trade between the two countries. Although I am also the minister to Japan, I should not express any views on Sino-Japanese relations in terms of my duties, but I privately hope that China and Japan can understand each other and increase friendship. This is not only for the sake of China and Japan, but also for world peace. I have been stationed in Japan for two years, and this year I happen to have a regular two-month vacation. This time I come to China and plan to stay for a month and plan to visit Guangzhou, or I may need to go to the Philippines on the way, and then return to Japan to take a vacation. During my absence from China, Mr. Ormond, the Secretary of the Embassy, will act as the agent. Now that Chairman Lin is in Guangzhou, when to go to Beijing will have to wait for Chairman Lin to return to Beijing to approve the date of the audience and then go to Beijing to present my credentials. Mr. Aguilar is 42 years old and was born in Monterrey, northern Mexico. He participated in the revolution and made contributions and is a famous military man in Mexico. He is also an aviator and is good at driving. He has been serving in the diplomatic field for many years, serving as a military attache at the Mexican embassies in Sweden, Italy, and the United States. In 1935, he was promoted to minister to Japan, and this spring he was appointed as minister to China.</p>
<h3>Solving the Debt of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Principal Agreement Reached with Tsai Tseng-i; Basic Discussion on Returning Company Assets</p>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been burdened by accumulated debts. Despite the diligent efforts of successive general managers, the weight of these debts has hindered its progress. Recently, after Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, Dr. H.H. Kung, exchanged views with the HSBC Bank and the British authorities regarding the company's debt problem, a complete solution has been reached. This resolution is expected to significantly benefit the company's operations. General Manager Tsai Tseng-i of the company has released the following statement to the Central News Agency regarding the progress of this matter:</p>
<p>Commercial Negotiations Reach a Conclusion: The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has accumulated significant debts over the years. Most of its wharves and warehouses are mortgaged, and the need to repay substantial debts and interest annually has severely constrained its finances, making operational development difficult. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has been planning for years to resolve the company's old debts as soon as possible. The Ministry of Communications first consulted with the Ministry of Finance on a solution, seeking to resolve the loan issue with HSBC Bank. Minister of Finance Dr. H.H. Kung then engaged with British diplomatic authorities and HSBC Bank officials to research a solution, which has now reached a conclusion.</p>
<p>Procedures to be Handled in the Shortest Possible Time: The solution to the HSBC Bank debt issue, agreed upon this time, is based entirely on the spirit of Sino-British cooperation. The debt amount exceeds ten million yuan, and it will now be repaid in installments. The original interest rate will also be reduced, allowing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to repay its old debts without hindering business development. All principles have been agreed upon, and procedures will begin to be handled in the short term. Once the procedures are completed, the detailed content will be officially released.</p>
<p>Mortgaged Company Assets to be Returned: All wharves and warehouses of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company that were previously mortgaged to HSBC Bank will now be returned, and the company will manage them independently. The company will add various necessary equipment to the wharves and warehouses and seek gradual improvements. It will also gradually seek improvements in other areas to increase revenue and ensure that all old debts are repaid on schedule.</p>

At the same time, the completion ceremony of the new building of the Municipal Hygiene Laboratory and the unveiling ceremony of the statue of Mr. Hu Wen-hu were also held. Details of the events are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Those who attended the ceremony included Wu T'ieh-ch'eng, the former Mayor of Shanghai and the newly appointed Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government; Liu Jui-heng, Director of the National Health Administration; Yu Hung-chun, the Acting Mayor of this city; Wang Hsiao-lai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Shen I, Director of the Bureau of Public Works; Li T'ing-an, Director of the Bureau of Health; Yen Fu-ch'ing, President of the Shanghai Medical College; Weng Chih-lung, President of Tongji University and President of the Shanghai Municipal Hospital; Vice President Wu Li-kuo; Wu Shu-chen, Director of the Municipal Hygiene Laboratory; and more than a thousand members of the Chinese Medical Association.

<p>Venue Setup: The venue was set up in the open space in front of the Municipal Hospital's main entrance. The podium was located on the stone steps in front of the hospital's main entrance. A square table was placed on it for the stone statue of Sun Yat-sen. The flag of the party and the state was hung over the hospital entrance, and it was decorated with red and green ribbons.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's Report: Acting Mayor Yu, as chairman, led the ceremony and then gave a report, saying: "Distinguished guests, today, the Shanghai Municipal Government is holding the opening ceremony of the Municipal Hospital, the completion ceremony of the new building of the Hygiene Laboratory, and the unveiling ceremony of the statue of Mr. Hu Wen-hu. We are honored to have you here to guide us. Today, I will briefly report to you on the progress. The Shanghai Municipal Government's motive for establishing the Municipal Hospital dates back to 1932. The original purpose was not only to narrowly prosper the urban area but also to address the fact that Shanghai has a population of 3.5 million, and there was not a single municipal hospital. There were shortcomings in protecting the health of citizens and in medical technology research. Therefore, under the guidance of Mayor Wu T'ieh-ch'eng, we worked hard to carry out health construction. In 1933, we designated the site for the Shanghai Municipal Hospital and organized the Municipal Hospital Preparatory Committee. We invited Liu Heng-jui, Yeh Kung-ch'o, Yen Fu-ch'ing, Shen I, Li Yang-an, T'ang Po-sheng, Tung Ta-hsi, Tsai Tseng-chi, Earle, Dunlop, Tanr1ler, Li T'ing-an, Weng Chih-lung, and Kwan Sung-sheng, along with myself, for a total of seventeen people as committee members. In that year, the Bureau of Health drafted architectural drawings, invited bids, and started construction. In 1935, Mayor Wu held the foundation stone laying ceremony. At the end of 1936, the entire project was completed. We appointed Mr. Weng Chih-lung and Mr. Wu Li-kuo as president and vice president, respectively, and began office work. Now that all the arrangements are complete, we are holding the official opening ceremony today. The Municipal Hospital site covers a total of eighty-seven acres. The entire hospital building has nine buildings. Currently, only one-ninth of the hospital system has been completed. Furthermore, the work of the Hygiene Laboratory is to handle the city's bacterial examination, chemical inspection, pathological diagnosis, and the manufacture of various vaccines and serums. The site was originally located on Chiuchiang Road, Kwangtung Street, and has been established for ten years. Because the municipal government felt that technical agencies should be connected to each other in order to see the benefits of mutual assistance and the convenience of mutual assistance, and also because the Hygiene Laboratory itself needed a perfectly equipped building for its own development, we chose a site of sixteen acres near the Municipal Hospital for construction. The foundation was laid in 1935 and completed in 1936. However, most of the construction costs were donated by Mr. Hu Wen-hu. In summary, the Shanghai Municipal Hospital and the Hygiene Laboratory took five years to prepare, and the construction and equipment costs totaled more than six million yuan. Therefore, the establishment of these two agencies was not easy. We are very grateful for the enthusiastic help from all sectors of society. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the municipal government to Mr. Hu Wen-hu for his generous donation and to the preparatory committee members of the Municipal Hospital for their hard work. Today, what I have reported is only a small contribution to the Shanghai Municipal Government's promotion of health construction. I hope that all guests will give us more guidance."</p>

<p>Mr. Wu's Speech: Then, Wu T'ieh-ch'eng, the newly appointed Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, gave a speech, briefly saying: "I was ordered to go to Guangdong and was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 2nd to take office. Due to circumstances, it was postponed for a few days, and I am very happy to be able to participate in today's grand ceremony. Acting Mayor Yu has reported to you on the preparation and establishment process of the Municipal Hospital and the Municipal Hygiene Laboratory. Shanghai is a metropolis with a population of over 3.5 million. The prosperity of Shanghai is closely related to the health of all citizens. The health of citizens depends on whether the public health facilities are thorough. In other words, if the public health facilities can be complete, the citizens can maintain their health, and the city can prosper. The municipal government is aware of this. Although the municipal authorities suffered various blows during the January 28th Incident, the municipal government colleagues, in their concern for the health of citizens, have not dared to neglect public health facilities and have never been content with makeshift arrangements. Therefore, the reconstruction of the Municipal Hygiene Laboratory and the construction of the Municipal Hospital were undertaken. After two or three years of preparation, it has been completed today. The opening day also coincides with the opening day of the Chinese Medical Association. All the leaders of the medical community across the country who participate in the ceremony have a deep understanding and experience of medical affairs and will be able to guide today's opening Municipal Hospital and Hygiene Laboratory. They will be able to point out where the equipment is inadequate or other various errors so that we can improve. We also hope that in the future, we will improve and enrich the hospital's equipment and hope that the number of municipal hospitals in the city will increase day by day, so that all Shanghai citizens can enjoy the happiness of public health facilities, then the health of the citizens and the prosperity of the city will be in sight. I have served in Shanghai for many years and have lived here for a long time. Shanghai can be said to be my second hometown. Therefore, in the future, I am still willing to contribute as a citizen to the development of medical affairs in this city."</p>
<h3>Unveiling of Mr. Hu Wen-hu's Statue</h3>

<p>Mr. Liu's Speech: Liu Jui-heng, Director of the National Health Administration, said in his speech: "In the past few years, I have been ordered by the central government to reorganize the national health administration. During these years, I have felt that the happiest thing is that health agencies in various places are either planning to build, holding foundation stone laying ceremonies, completion ceremonies, or opening ceremonies. This indicates that the number of health agencies across the country is increasing day by day, and the health cause is developing day by day. Our country has always neglected health affairs, so the national health situation is extremely immature. It is fortunate that we can gradually pay attention to it. In particular, Shanghai City, through the enthusiastic planning and hard work of the former Mayor and the former Director of the Bureau of Health, Mr. Hu, and the current Director, Mr. Li, has been very successful. In terms of all health facilities, Shanghai can be a model for the whole country. In the future, I hope that other major cities can use Shanghai as a model and strive for the development of health undertakings. I am also entrusted by Mr. Zhu, President of the Chinese Medical Association, to congratulate all the members on the rapid progress of Shanghai's health administration. I would also like to present an honorary doctorate in medicine to former Mayor Wu and Acting Mayor Yu, who have been particularly helpful and hardworking in health undertakings. This title is not only given to those who have special research in medicine, but also to those who are enthusiastic about medical affairs."</p>
<p>Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony: Then, the ribbon-cutting ceremony began. Accompanied by the music, the wife of the Acting Mayor Yu slowly walked up the stone steps to the front of the hospital entrance and cut the red and green ribbons tied to the hospital entrance. Then, she went to the gate of the new building of the Municipal Hygiene Laboratory, where the wife of Director Li T'ing-an performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Then, at the statue of Mr. Hu Wen-hu behind the Municipal Hygiene Laboratory, Acting Mayor Yu personally performed the unveiling ceremony. After the completion of various ceremonies, guests were invited for refreshments and tea, and then dispersed.</p>

<h3>Joint Declaration by Various Native Place Associations in Shanghai Opposing Tax Increases</h3>
<p>Presenting Seven Proposals; Insisting on Striving to the End</p>
<p>According to the Takung News Agency, more than sixty native place associations in Shanghai, including those from Kwangtung, Pudong, Ningpo, Paoshan, Chuchi, Chaochow, Shantung, Szechuan, Shaoshing, Hopei, Shehsien, Huining, Changchow, Shangyu, Nant'ung, Chenhai, T'aitsang, Chiating, Kiangsu, Sungkiang, Chekiang, Yangchow Eight Counties, Kiangning, Kaoyu, Iwu, Ninghai, Ch'ungming, Haimen, Ch'angshu, Sheng County, Chingkiang Fukien, and Lungyen, issued a joint declaration opposing the increase in municipal general taxes by the Municipal Council, saying: "Fellow villagers, why do we leave our hometowns and come here? Isn't it to make a living? Since the January 28th Incident, our vitality has been completely lost. Who should be blamed for this? If the Municipal Council, the 'quasi-autonomous body' in the First Special District, could have planned carefully and made appropriate arrangements so that a large number of marines were not stationed in Hongkew, then the cruel devastation could have been avoided, and the existing prosperity would not have been shaken. Tracing back to the source, this 'quasi-autonomous body' should bear absolute responsibility. Instead of showing sympathy when our vitality has not yet recovered, it is exploiting us. Mr. Arnold, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, has brazenly proposed increasing the municipal general tax (commonly known as the police tax) from 14% to 16%. Calculated as a percentage, this is an increase of 14.3% over the current rate (about one and a half percent). Although the Chinese directors, who represent more than 95% of the taxpayers, have clearly stated the pros and cons and opposed it vigorously, it was ultimately passed by a vote of five to six (the directors of the Municipal Council include two Americans, five British, two Japanese, and five Chinese. In this meeting, the Japanese directors abstained, the British and Americans voted in favor, and the Chinese directors opposed). The reason given for increasing the tax is that the revenue has decreased and is insufficient to cover expenses. Alas, the finances of the Municipal Council were originally very stable. Who is responsible for making them unstable? There is factual evidence to prove this. The municipal general tax is a major source of revenue in the financial sector, and we are all deeply aware of this. If the economic support is insufficient and the administrative facilities are affected, then opening up revenue sources and reducing expenditures by the Municipal Council is a well-known ancient teaching. However, the reasons for the insufficient support should also be explored in depth, and comprehensive planning should be done to make up for any deficiencies. The reason for the financial deficiency of the Municipal Council is the decline of the market, the decline of industry and commerce, the increasing number of vacant houses, and the reduction of revenue, especially the excessive waste. The trend of increasing revenue over the years can be known. The collapse of industry and commerce and the increase in vacant houses are all affected by the January 28th War. If the municipal tax is increased because of this, the decline of industry and commerce will be even more unimaginable. What method can be used to solve the difficulties? Is there any reason to treat the branches without considering the roots? Therefore, the only way for the Municipal Council to open up revenue sources is to underestimate the land price, collect taxes on vacant houses so that vacant houses can be rented out at low prices, and the income from general taxes can also be increased accordingly. Moreover, the resolution to collect taxes on vacant houses was notified by the Chinese Ratepayers Association three years ago, but it was resisted and not implemented. What is the intention? If it is said that vacant houses are uninhabited and do not enjoy the right to protection, they should not bear the obligation to pay taxes. If this is the case, then we are all willing to defend ourselves, so we have no obligation to pay taxes. In terms of reducing expenditures, it is urgent to reduce expenditures and save expenses. It is found that there are many items in the budget of the Municipal Council that can be reduced. Details are as follows: 1. Senior foreign staff work less than eight hours a day and are paid thousands of dollars. Moreover, they are very ignorant of local customs and social conditions, and they are merely figureheads who are harmful and useless. Such staff should be cut. 2. Foreign staff in our country all use our national currency to calculate their food, clothing, housing, and transportation expenses. Their salaries should also be calculated in national currency. One-third of their salaries should not be subsidized due to the depreciation of the pound sterling. Moreover, when the exchange rate was at its highest, there was no reduction in salaries. Human feelings and laws do not allow this. Therefore, the exchange rate subsidy should be cancelled to increase revenue. 3. Entertainment facilities are required when the economy is prosperous. Now, there is still concern that formal expenditures are insufficient. How can there be surplus funds for senseless waste? The Chinese Ratepayers Association resolved to cancel the music team three or four years ago, but Mr. Arnold insisted on maintaining it. No wonder the economy is tight. 4. How do we Chinese feel about the protection and security of the "quasi-autonomous body"? The impression is very deep. Robberies still occur on the most prosperous Nanking Road. We turn a deaf ear to the armed demonstrations and shelling of Shanghai by the army and navy, and we respond sluggishly. In such a serious situation, the Russian team has not been seen to serve responsibly. Unjustified supplies are wasting public funds. Therefore, the team should be disbanded to save money. 5. Tax arrears can be sued in law. Why are general taxes under special influence allowed to be delayed? If all overdue taxes are recovered in full, it will be enough to balance this year's budget. In summary, implementing the above five points step by step will not only increase revenue but also have a surplus. We, the citizens residing in the First Special District, are also fellow villagers of various native place associations. Our interests are related, so we have consistent proposals and slogans: 1. We unanimously oppose increasing the municipal general tax. 2. We unanimously propose to increase the number of Chinese directors. If it is not based on population, it should be based on the amount of taxes paid. 3. We unanimously propose to implement taxes on vacant houses. 4. We unanimously propose to underestimate land prices and collect taxes based on actual prices. 5. We unanimously propose to reduce the high salaries of foreign staff and cancel legally unfounded fictitious title staff. 6. We unanimously propose to cancel exchange rate subsidies. 7. We unanimously propose to cancel the music team and the Russian team. Fellow villagers, although Mr. Arnold's proposal to increase the municipal general tax has been passed by a five-to-six vote by the Municipal Council Board of Directors, the board of directors is the trustee of the taxpayers. Matters related to all taxpayers cannot be implemented without the approval of the taxpayers' meeting. This is not only the case in our country's laws, but also in the land regulations and the laws of the world. It is learned that the annual meetings of the taxpayers' associations are scheduled to be held separately on or before the 14th of this month. We hope that all fellow villagers will closely monitor these two meetings to realize our proposals. This is a special declaration."</p>

The chairman of the board, Yan Fuqing, and the managing directors, Gao Hanwen and Lu Zhixue, personally hosted the event. Due to the large number of guests, the banquet was held in two sittings. Lu Zhixue gave a speech, stating, "We originally planned to host this banquet at our company to welcome you all to Shanghai. However, fearing that your time would be limited, we specially rented this venue to fulfill our role as the host. The health of a nation's people depends on doctors, and pharmacies are an adjunct to doctors. Since pharmacies have a close relationship with doctors, we hope that medicine can develop rapidly in the future, and that the pharmaceutical industry can also develop accordingly. We also hope that you will not hesitate to give us your guidance." Cage Kyoto Zhou then delivered a reply, saying, "The important relationship between pharmacies and doctors is self-evident. Now, in this era of scientific progress in the 20th century, doctors must exchange knowledge to avoid conflicts in theory. The Chinese Medical Association is responsible for this. Doctors and the pharmaceutical industry must also cooperate to avoid neglecting either. Today, we are honored to be invited by Wuzhou Pharmacy to a banquet for all members of our association, a gathering to celebrate the cooperation between the medical and pharmaceutical fields." Finally, the company distributed gifts to add to the merriment. The guests and hosts parted happily at around 3:00 PM.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Sends Zeng Yangfeng to Guangdong</h3>
<p>To handle the Guangdong salt tax dispute</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance and the military and political authorities of Guangdong Province agreed some time ago to reorganize Guangdong's salt tax rates, allocating increased tax revenues to supplement the construction of the Guangmei Railway public debt fund. The Guangdong salt affairs agencies have been following this policy. Recently, it was reported that a few salt merchants, attempting to profit from this, demanded exemption from supplementary tax payments for salt stored in warehouses and in transit, and threatened to suspend operations. It is now reported that the Ministry of Finance's Salt Affairs Audit Office has specially dispatched Chief Inspector Zeng Yangfeng to handle the matter and to earnestly plan for promoting the sale of Guangdong salt. If necessary, he will imitate the Fujian official transport and merchant sales method to fundamentally reform the system and benefit the people's livelihood. It is also reported that after completing his official duties in Guangdong Province, Zeng Yangfeng will also visit Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces to inspect salt affairs and plan for improvements, to seek the balanced development of Guangdong and Huai salt.</p>

It is reported that Han will take the Qingdao Maru to Qingdao today, and then return to Jinan. Liu and Yu will also return north soon. Feng will take a short trip to Hangzhou before returning to his defense area.</p>
<h3>The Grand Medical Event (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>Party Headquarters Admonishment: Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, gave an admonition, saying, “Today, I am honored to participate in this grand ceremony. Our country has always valued good prime ministers and good doctors equally. The rise and fall of the nation is closely related to the strength and weakness of the people's bodies. However, in the course of life, one cannot avoid illnesses, which can only be relieved by doctors. When people are ill, it inevitably hinders their careers. Therefore, our country has always attached great importance to medical affairs. Western philosophers say that only with a healthy body can there be the achievement of a sound career. Today, the new campus of Shanghai Medical College has been completed, and Zhongshan Hospital has opened. Considering the naming, Shanghai is the center of all undertakings. Therefore, the completion of Shanghai Medical College and Hospital will make it the center of medical affairs in our country. Dr. Sun Yat-sen took saving the world as his mission, so the opening of Zhongshan Hospital will be able to save patients universally in the future. Finally, I dare to contribute two points: first, to ensure that the general public can benefit from your hospital; second, to emphasize prevention so that the general public can understand health knowledge. I wish your hospital a promising future.”</p>
<p>Director Liu’s Speech: Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Department of Health, gave an admonition, saying, “The central government feels the greatest lack of talent in running local health undertakings. There are more than 20 medical education institutions in the country, but they are ultimately insufficient. I sincerely hope that Shanghai Medical College and Zhongshan Hospital will be able to fully cultivate a large amount of talent in the future. Seeing today's Shanghai Medical College and Zhongshan Hospital, with their perfect internal settings and the spirit they exude, I am sure they will live up to people's expectations. I also think that as long as our medical colleagues can work hard and achieve results, people from all walks of life will surely fully assist. The success of Zhongshan Hospital, with the donation and support of more than 900 units, is clear evidence. You are all prominent figures in the medical field and bear heavy responsibilities. In the future, I hope that you will all work hard everywhere with this spirit, and society will surely provide a lot of help. Finally, I also have one more thought: under the current social conditions in China, it is easy for hospitals to be criticized, but we must not be discouraged because of this. We should continue to move forward, strive to satisfy people, and establish hospitals everywhere to serve society. This is what I eagerly hope for.”</p>
<p>Ambassador Wang’s Speech: Wang Zhengting, the ambassador to the United States, gave a speech on behalf of all the guests, saying, “I represent all the guests to express some opinions. First, everything I have seen today, in terms of equipment and construction, is satisfactory. This is the result of the hard work of President Yan and all his colleagues over the years, and their future contributions to the people will be immense. I can represent the people to express my heartfelt gratitude. Second, I express my admiration for the establishment of Shanghai Medical College, which has a very solid foundation after only ten years. Its future prospects are truly limitless. Third, I congratulate them on a promising future. I firmly believe that today’s success of the Shanghai medical center has the following conditions: 1. Everything is carried out based on an orderly and step-by-step plan; 2. Following the plan, step by step, and continuously striving; if one is enthusiastic only at the beginning and discouraged when encountering difficulties, one will definitely not succeed; 3. A spirit of sacrifice; anything done with the public interest first will succeed, and anything done with private interests first will fail. In the future, if we rely on these three spirits, we will surely succeed and benefit the country and the nation.” Correction: The sub-headline "Participation of Celebrities" in the second day's report "Grand Medical Event Yesterday" was mistakenly printed as "工" instead of "名". We hereby correct it.</p>
<h3>Lu Bohong and Others Departed for Henan Yesterday to Provide Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Henan Committee Sends Representatives to Shanghai to Greet Them, Meeting with Shang Zhen to Discuss Work Relief Methods</p>
<p>According to the New News Agency, the Henan Provincial Relief Committee is urgently seeking relief for disaster victims. It has specially sent Chang Zizhen, a member of the Standing Committee, and Guo Fangwu, the dean of the Luoyang Temporary Capital Orphanage, to Shanghai on the 2nd to contact the Joint Charity Relief Association to make arrangements and to welcome Lu Bohong and others to Henan for disaster relief. According to Mr. Guo, after receiving news of the disaster relief efforts of the Shanghai Charity Relief Association, the affected areas of the province have been sending letters requesting relief. Therefore, large numbers of disaster victims have been requesting the provincial government to provide relief as soon as possible, and their plight is unbearable to witness. Therefore, he and others were specially dispatched to Shanghai to contact the Relief Association and to request Mr. Lu Bohong to go to Henan for disaster relief as soon as possible. The Shanghai Relief Association has now allocated 100,000 yuan, along with 400,000 yuan allocated from the provincial government's relief funds, to handle emergency relief. Once Mr. Lu arrives in Henan and meets with Chairman Shang to discuss the matter, they will begin to go to the disaster areas to provide relief. The Shanghai Relief Association has allocated 120,000 yuan for the relief efforts, along with 550,000 yuan allocated from the provincial government. The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association expressed strong support for this proposal and agreed to assist. The proposed work relief methods are roughly as follows: 1. Build water conservancy projects; 2. Build roads; 3. Develop silkworm farming in the mountains; 4. Open warehouses for disaster relief and transport grain to stabilize prices; 5. Develop mining and factories; 6. Repair capitals; 7. Relocate disaster victims to populate border areas. This plan will be implemented after representatives from the Shanghai Relief Association contact the provincial government. Mr. Lu and others departed for Henan yesterday, accompanied by Mr. Chang and Mr. Guo.</p>

<h3>A Large Quantity of Rayon Found in the Huishan Wharf Warehouse</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Department dispatched several examiners to the Huishan Wharf warehouse yesterday afternoon to inspect the goods in the warehouse. They discovered 285 boxes of Japanese rayon that did not match the customs declaration and tax payment and immediately detained them. In the past, tax evasion incidents have often been discovered in the warehouses of various wharves in this city. In view of this, the Jianghai Customs authorities implemented a wharf warehouse management system in April last year. Shipping companies from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and other countries have complied with the order, but Japanese shipping companies have refused to comply. Therefore, illegal incidents of this kind still occur in the Japanese shipping wharves and warehouses. The Jianghai Customs authorities expressed their deep indignation at this and will vigorously urge Japanese shipping companies to implement this management system as soon as possible. It is also reported that a certain amount of smuggled copper coins were seized in the Japanese passenger room of the Japanese ship Chichibu Maru, which sailed from Shanghai to Japan at 5:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Where Is Benevolence? He Ren Discards Corpse in Alley</h3>
<p>Concubine Shi Xiaogenzi Hangs Herself, No Money to Buy Coffin, Wrapped in Rags</p>
<p>At 7:05 AM on the 28th of last month, a female corpse, about 30 years old and dressed in cloth clothes, was found in Lane 161, Aivenyi Road. Blood was flowing from her mouth. It was discovered by Chinese Constable No. 112, who reported it to the New Gate Police Station. The Police Station ordered detectives to carry the body to the Feilun Road Mortuary and reported it to the First Special Court Prosecutor's Office for inspection. Because the body had strangulation marks, it was instructed to wait for a forensic examination before further review. It is now known that after several days of investigation by the Police Station, the case has yielded some clues. It is also learned that the deceased was named</p>
<p>Shi Xiaogenzi, from Yangzhou. She lived with her lover He Ren in the No. 2 residence in the lane. Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, He Ren, along with his cousin He Zaisheng, were arrested and taken to the Police Station for detention. This morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court with a request for detention. According to the Police Station lawyer Li Zhishan, the two defendants are suspected of murder and</p>
<p>Abandoning a Corpse. The Police Station requested detention because it had not received the forensic examination report. He Ren claimed to be from Yangzhou, and worked as a porridge stall vendor. He has a wife, Zhao, at home. He worked outside and had an affair with the deceased, Shi Xiaogenzi, living together in No. 2, Lane 161, Aivenyi Road. On the afternoon of the 27th of last month, the deceased and He Ren</p>
<p>Had a Quarrel over a Trivial Matter. He immediately went downstairs, while the deceased continued to cry and make noise in the room. At 10 PM, He's son, Xiao Laoshu, called for the deceased to open the door, but she did not respond. Peering through the crack in the door, he saw the deceased hanging from the threshold and urgently reported it to his father. He pried open the door, and the body fell down with it, causing facial injuries. She was already dead, and since he had no money to buy a coffin for burial, he discarded the body in the alley the next morning.</p>
<p>Discovered and Arrested. The above situation is based on the defendants' confessions. However, how Shi Xiaogenzi died is still unknown, as the forensic examination report has not been received. However, the defendant is only guilty of abandoning the corpse and should be detained. Questioned, He Ren confessed that the deceased was his lover. On that day, she was jealous of his conversation with his wife, which led to a quarrel. Later, she</p>
<p>Hanged Herself in the Room. Because he lacked the funds to buy a coffin, he wrapped the corpse in rags and abandoned it in the alley so that others could bury it. There was no other reason. He Zaisheng claimed to be a barber and He Ren's cousin, living together in the same house. He knew nothing about their quarrel. He only helped to discard the corpse, and so on. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the confession and ordered that He Ren and others be detained for seven days for further review.</p>
<h3>Luo Xi Demands Compensation, Awarded 1,000 Yuan</h3>

Luo also filed an incidental civil suit, seeking living expenses of 40 yuan per month for 40 years, totaling 19,200 yuan, and 1,000 yuan for consolation money, for a total of 20,200 yuan. As a result, He was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for three years, and the incidental civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court. He was dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. The part related to the incidental civil suit was heard in court by Judge Li Liang a few days ago. Both parties were summoned for trial, and the hearing was declared closed, with a date set for sentencing. During the appeal period, He was detained in the detention center. He applied for suspension of detention a few days ago, and the presiding judge of the Second Special Court Criminal Division, Liao Yi, approved it. He was released on bail by his younger brother, He Guangchang. All of these things have been recorded in this newspaper. Now, the part related to the incidental civil suit was sentenced yesterday. The plaintiff and defendant, Luo and He, arrived at the court at 2:00 PM to await instructions. At three o'clock, Judge Miao Qingbang of the Second Special Court, acting on behalf of the Fifth Civil Court, summoned Luo and He to the case. After briefly questioning their ages and nationalities, he announced the judgment. The main text stated, "The defendant shall compensate the plaintiff 1,000 yuan. The plaintiff's remaining claims are rejected. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant for one-fifth and by the plaintiff for the remainder." It is reported that He expressed dissatisfaction with this judgment and will appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court after receiving the judgment. As for the part related to the criminal suit, the Second Special Court has submitted the case file to the Third Branch of the High Court.</p>

<h3>Pan Wenbao et al. Forged Banknotes, a Roll of Paper of Identical Quality</h3>
<p>Jin Guyong Claims Ignorance, Bail Denied, to be Jointly Tried</p>
<p>Pan Wenbao, from Pudong, operated a sundry goods store at No. 149 Dongjiaxing Road. Recently, he was found to be forging five-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China, intending to profit by passing them off as genuine. At 8:20 PM the day before yesterday, Shanghai Detective Shao Jingfan and Detective Yang Xinzheng of the Jiaxing Road police station discovered this and, together with Western detectives, secretly went to the address and arrested him. They found a large sheet of white paper on which twelve five-yuan counterfeit national banknotes of the Bank of China had already been printed. He confessed that the counterfeit banknotes were made at the Xiesheng Printing House at No. 143 Hujiabang, at the end of Zhoujiazui Road in Zhabei, by his friend Qian Yongfu (also known as Shen Yongfu), who had previously entrusted him with sales and storage at the Zhuangyuan Inn on Jiaxing Road. The Chinese and Western detectives then rushed to Zhabei and, together with detectives from the local police station, went to arrest him. However, the doors of the Xiesheng Printing House were closed, and there was no response to knocking. Subsequently, stating that the police station had a matter to investigate, a woman opened the door. The detectives entered and asked if Shen Yongfu was there, and she claimed he had gone elsewhere and had fled upon hearing the news. They arrested a suspect, Jin Guyong (age 42, from Changzhou). Inside the printing house, there were only several machines and no similarly printed counterfeit banknotes. However, they found a large roll of white paper that, upon inspection, was of the same quality as the paper used for the twelve five-yuan counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of China found at Pan Wenbao's place. Jin Guyong was taken to the Linping Road police station for temporary detention. Pan Wenbao was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, requested an extension and filed a public prosecution based on Article 196, Section 1 of the Criminal Law regarding the crime of counterfeiting currency. It was ordered that Pan Wenbao be returned to custody for further investigation. Jin Guyong was taken back to the police station by Detective Shao with a court order for detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieffen presided over the hearing. Jin Guyong claimed that he had recently come to Shanghai from Changzhou and knew Bao Hairong, a shareholder of the printing house. He went there at 2:00 PM that afternoon, but Bao was out. In the evening, it rained, so he stayed at the printing house temporarily. Suddenly, police officers knocked on the door, and Bao's wife opened it. He said he was sleeping with several workers and was mistakenly arrested. He claimed to know nothing about printing five-yuan counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of China. He retained lawyers Ma Leming and Qian Xingzhong to defend him and requested bail. Judge Xiao denied the request and ordered him to remain in custody for a joint trial with Pan Wenbao.</p>
<h3>The Case of Destroying the Caojiadu Police Station Heard Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Fourteen Defendants Deny Rioting and Assault, Case Still Under Investigation, Defendants Remain on Original Bail</p>
<p>Sun Qiantai, the chief representative of the workers of the Toyota Textile Factory in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, was suddenly stabbed on the morning of the 19th of last month. Subsequently, the workers themselves captured the instigator, Shi Fulin, and sent him to the Caojiadu Police Station for handling. Dissatisfied with the handling, they gathered thousands of people and destroyed the police station, also assaulting the chief of the station, Tan Baoshou. Upon learning of this, the Municipal Police Bureau immediately ordered the commander of the Guards, Zhang Jinshan, to lead police officers to the scene, where they arrested sixteen people, including Jie Hongfa, Yang A'er, Zhang Wenyuan, Yang Yuantian, Wu Jinsheng, Gan Songlin, Jiang A'si, Hu Shouhou, Zhou Lvchang, Chen Guohua, Chen Chunsheng, Qin Qiaosheng, Shi Chunqi, Yu Haoda, Zhang A'san, and Wang A'san, and transferred them to the local court for investigation. Because the defendants repeatedly requested to be released from custody, they were ordered to be released on bail. Former Prosecutor Li Fen repeatedly summoned them for questioning and filed charges of assault and obstructing official duties. The Criminal Court, presided over by Judge Bai Dongling, heard the case once but did not conclude it. Details were reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Bai continued the hearing. The plaintiff, Tan Baoshou, did not appear and instead delegated Zhao Xianmo and Xing Zichun, officers of the bureau, to appear in court and state the previous events, requesting a thorough investigation. Fourteen defendants appeared, including Wang A'san, Zhang A'san, Yu Haoda, Shi Chunqi, Qin Qiaosheng, Chen Chunsheng, Chen Guohua, Zhou Lvchang, Jiang A'si, Gan Songlin, Wu Jinsheng, Yang Yuantian, and Zhang Wenyuan. The two defendants, Jie Hongfa and Hu Shouhou, did not appear again. The judge questioned them one by one for a long time.

The judge stated that the case still required investigation and would be continued. All defendants remained on their original bail.</p>

<h3>Death Resulting from Playful Injury, Family Has No Intention to Sue</h3>
<p>Police Believe It's a Crime Requiring Prosecution, Family Cries and Protests Upon Hearing of Release</p>
<p>Zhang Guixing, a tea server at the Jinji Yarn and Flower Shop at No. 12 Gongshun Lane, Guangdong Road, had an argument with his colleague Qiao Yinglin on the afternoon of the 8th of last month due to a playful prank. Qiao then threw a spittoon at Zhang's head, causing him to fall ill. He died on the 23rd. Zhang's family reported this to the police, who arrested Qiao and sent him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The forensic examination of Zhang's body revealed that the death was due to improper treatment of the injury, but the extent of the injury was minimal. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Feng Shide continued the hearing in the First Criminal Court. Qiao's lawyer, Fan Gang, appeared in court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the extent of the injury caused by the defendant to Zhang Guixing was extremely minor. Therefore, the crime committed by the defendant was a minor injury, which, according to the law, requires prosecution. The police had notified the deceased's father, Zhang Tongtai, and the deceased's wife, Zhang Li, to come to the police station and state their position on whether or not to file a lawsuit against the defendant. However, Zhang and his daughter-in-law did not come. Later, two detectives went to inquire, and they both avoided them. Since the family had no intention to sue, the police would not prosecute Qiao and requested that Qiao be released from custody. Judge Feng then ordered Qiao Yinglin to be released. Zhang Tongtai and Zhang Li suddenly cried and protested loudly upon hearing the court order. Subsequently, court police ordered them to leave the court.</p>

<h3>Zhang Ganqing et al., Who Have Committed Multiple Crimes, Detained Pending Judgment, to be Transferred Later</h3>
<p>Related to Multiple Murder Cases, Judge Liao Explains the Order of Transfer</p>
<p>Last month, on the 19th at midnight, a French Concession Chinese police patrol stopped a suspicious pedestrian at the intersection of Gansidong Road and Leimi Road. Upon searching him, they found 268 yuan in auxiliary currency notes. He confessed that his name was Zhang Ganqing, a 37-year-old Anhui native, residing at No. 68 Maiqi Road. He was taken to the police station on suspicion of theft and sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. Later, it was discovered that on December 1st of the previous year, Zhang had organized a gang to rob a woman of her purse on Lafayete Road and shot and killed a Russian, Li Yaming George. On the 17th of last month, he robbed the Dacheng Qianzhuang in Zhenjiang with accomplices. He was transferred back to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation, and accomplices were arrested. Subsequently, Chinese and Western detectives successively arrested twelve male and female accomplices, including Wang Fu'an, Song Shiqing, Zhang Guangcai, Xia Kangwei, Wang Zhigui, Wu Yang, Shen Sun, Lin Xia, Zheng Bohuan, and Ma Xia, in a bungalow at No. 122 Huanlong Road and No. 128, Julai Lane. They also seized a Browning handgun, fourteen bullets, two box cannons, and thirty-nine bullets. They were sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and joint investigation. Details have been reported in this newspaper several times. Yesterday morning, Criminal Court Judge Liao Hong presided over the hearing in the First Criminal Court. The Zhenjiang Provincial Police Bureau and the Municipal Police Bureau also sent officers to the court with documents requesting the transfer of the defendants. After the court first questioned each defendant's name and place of origin, the Police Department lawyer stated that, apart from Zheng Bohuan and Wu Sanjie, who were found to have no connection to the case, the remaining eleven people, including Zhang Ganqing and Wang Fu'an, had committed serious crimes of robbery and murder. Due to the importance and complexity of the case, the investigation was not yet complete, and a request was made for a one-week extension for a detailed investigation before filing charges. The investigating officer then reported that Zhang Ganqing et al. were also involved in the murder of Yin Bingen, an investigator, in the case of the Fuli Road World Coal Company and on October 11th of the previous year. The court, considering that the Zhenjiang and Municipal Police Bureaus had sent documents requesting the transfer of Zhang Ganqing et al. to their jurisdictions, summoned the officers from the two police bureaus to report the reasons for the transfer. The investigator from the Zhenjiang Police Bureau stated that the Jiangsu Provincial Government had ordered the case to be solved within a limited time after the robbery of the Dacheng Qianzhuang. The bureau had now determined that Zhang Ganqing, Wang Fu'an, Zhang Guangcai, and Shen Zhang were the key offenders in the case, along with three others who were at large. Zhang Ganqing had already confessed in the French Concession Police, and a transfer was requested. The investigator from the Municipal Police Bureau stated that the investigation had revealed that the defendants had also committed a case of robbery and murder in the urban area and requested that the defendants be transferred. The court, considering the statements, ordered that the case be postponed until April 12th for further questioning. The defendants were returned to custody. The court also ordered the officers from the two police bureaus that the case would be tried and judged by the Municipal Police Bureau first, and the Zhenjiang Police Bureau would then be allowed to transfer the defendants after the Municipal Police Bureau had completed its investigation.</p>

<h3>Tragic Incident in Donggou, Two Lives Lost to Pufferfish Roe</h3>
<p>Xu Buying's Entire Family Poisoned, Director Wang Extends Medical Treatment for Emergency</p>
<p>Xu Buying, a 31-year-old Jiangbei native residing at No. 6, Lane 23, Donggao Road, Donggou, Pudong, supported himself by scavenging. He had a wife, two sons, and two daughters. The night before last, at 6:00 PM, a certain Liu, who worked as a water police officer, obtained several pufferfish from a fishing boat in Donggou Port and took them home to cook. Liu's wife kindly gave the roe to the Xu family. Xu was very happy and ordered his wife to cook it. He also bought 300 cash worth of sorghum wine from the town. The whole family sat down to eat heartily. However, in less than half an hour, everyone, big and small, experienced stomach pain and numbness in their hands and feet. Xu even developed a high fever and shortness of breath. He took off his outerwear and lay on the bed. Before long, he was unable to speak. His wife, who had not eaten much, was still relatively conscious. She was momentarily at a loss and wailed with the children. When neighbors heard the crying and went inside to investigate, they inquired about the cause and learned that they had been poisoned by the fish. According to local folk remedies, they urgently used feces water to force them to swallow for detoxification. They also rushed to report to the Donggou Police Station. Director Wang immediately notified the Gaohang District Police Station by telephone, who dispatched police to request Western doctor Tang to arrive at the Xu family at 11:00 PM to give injections and emergency treatment. However, Xu Buying had already died. His second son, A'gen, age 9, also died from poisoning. His 12-year-old eldest son, Genfa, and his 7-year-old third daughter, Gendi, his 4-year-old fourth daughter, Dalinzi, and Xu's wife, all four of them, were rescued and survived and were out of danger. The bodies of the father and son were placed in the house. Director Wang informed the local security chief at noon yesterday and transferred the report to the local court, who sent an official to examine the bodies and then returned the body to the family to prepare coffins for the burial.</p>

Afterwards, Wenzhong reported the incident to the local police station, requesting an investigation. However, Wenzhong and his wife were deeply concerned about the lack of descendants and were worried. An old Zhu woman, a relative living with them, mentioned in a casual conversation that a Haimen woman was looking for a patron. The old couple was delighted and entrusted Zhu Fuzhu and Zhu Yansheng to arrange a marriage. They introduced Huang Linmei's daughter, Zhaodi, a 21-year-old Haimen native, who was sold to Tang Wenzhong for 100 yuan. On November 14th of the Lunar Calendar last year, a deed of adoption was drawn up, and the money was paid on the spot. She was named Fengnan. At first, they lived in harmony, helping with the work. But on December 14th, Fengnan left on the pretext of going out and never returned. They reasoned with the matchmakers, but they shirked their responsibility. At this point, Wenzhong knew that he had been deceived. Yesterday afternoon, he reported the information to the Caojing Police Station, requesting an investigation.</p>

The plaintiff Xu Wang and Xu Baoshu did not appear in court. Only Yang Xiaomei appeared in court with her son and admitted that she had been having an affair with Xu Baoshu for four years, but she claimed that Xu Wang had introduced them. She said that because her husband had no son, she asked me to be her husband's concubine and that Xu Wang et al. paid off my husband's family to settle the matter. The three of us have always lived together. Recently, because the child I gave birth to could eat, she asked her husband to abandon me. When I refused, she fabricated the charges and sued. But I still want to live with Xu Baoshu. After hearing this, the judge declared that the case was clear and announced the adjournment, setting a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Thirty-One Dead Bodies Frozen in the Hold of the Jiang'an Steamer</h3>

These people have no home to go to and cannot afford enough food and clothing. Their situation is extremely pitiful, and therefore, they often freeze or starve to death. At 8 PM last night, another dock worker was found frozen to death in the hold of the Yangtze River-bound Jiang'an steamer. The person was wearing a black short shirt and blue cloth pants, and was about twenty years old. The steamer, considering this to be related to hygiene, moved the body to the wharf and reported it to the Customs Water Police Station.

<h3>Newly Appointed Consul to Jambi, Shou Ximin, Left for his Post Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Transporting Chinese Goods to Annam</h3>
<p>Must be Marked "Made in China" to Allow Easy Identification by Vietnamese Customs</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified various trade associations, stating: "On the 21st of this month, a letter was received from the Consulate General in Hanoi, No. 2245, stating that according to the French Trademark Law of January 11, 1892, 'All natural or manufactured foreign goods that have a trademark, name, symbol, or any mark on the goods, wooden boxes, large and small packages, sets, or instructions that could lead people to believe that the goods are produced or manufactured in France are prohibited from import, storage in customs warehouses, and transit.' Most of our country's goods are sold within the country, and except for raw materials, which are marked with the country of origin, the finished goods are generally not marked with 'Made in China.' Moreover, various products are now often exquisitely decorated, making them indistinguishable from foreign goods. If they are not marked with 'Made in China,' problems may easily arise when passing through Vietnamese customs. At best, the goods will be confiscated and a fine imposed; at worst, imprisonment may result. For example, recently, the Haiphong Customs confiscated 800 boxes of soap from the Xiamen Fuhecheng Soap Factory, which were being transported to Yunnan by the Guangfu Xiang Company, because they were not marked with 'Made in China' and their form was similar to that of goods produced by Haiphong manufacturers, and therefore were considered to be falsely representing French goods. In addition to confiscating the goods, the case was also transferred to the court for trial. Such cases occur frequently. In order to protect the interests of Chinese merchants and reduce disputes with Vietnamese customs, this consulate general requests your association to inform all manufacturers that all goods imported into or transiting through Vietnam must be marked with 'Made in China' so that Vietnamese customs can easily identify them. In addition to sending separate letters, a copy of the French Trademark Law is enclosed for your association's reference and dissemination." This association hereby records and forwards the letter, hoping that you will investigate and notify your members to pay attention to it.</p>

All matters related to the one person previously recommended by the Real Estate Association should be handled by this association from now on. A letter has been sent to your association for review. This association's tenth and eleventh joint meetings of the Executive and Supervisory Committees on April 1st have collectively nominated Li Bohan, a standing committee member of this association, as this year's Real Estate Committee member of the Public Works Department.

Later, due to his recovery, Director Tan repeatedly petitioned the General Bureau to resign, but this has not yet been approved. However, Director Tan is determined to leave, so he first took leave of absence from the General Bureau to await approval. It is now learned that Commissioner Cai of the Municipal Police Bureau, considering that labor unrest frequently occurs within the jurisdiction of Caojiadu, and that the location is crucial, ordered Wang Weiming, the Inspector General of the Inspection Department of the Bureau, to act as the Branch Director yesterday.</p>

<p>Informal Discussion</p>
<h3>A Memorandum</h3>
<p>— Fang Kewen</p>
<p>It's Children's Day again. Children are the cornerstones of the future of the country. Setting aside this day, having a commemorative holiday, letting children rejoice for a day, and also prompting those who are concerned about children's education and parents to pay attention is an unassailable principle. However, if Children's Day only prompts adults to pay some attention on this one day, without plans and practice for the future of children; if Children's Day is only giving children an opportunity to have a joyful play, trying to give them a day of fun, "giving preferential treatment" to them for a day, and then throwing them aside after Children's Day, letting them wallow and grow in sewage ponds, waiting for the arrival of the second Children's Day to pull them out again, "giving preferential treatment" to them for a day, then such a Children's Day is as good as nothing.</p>
<p>What were our past Children's Days like? What are we doing for today's Children's Day?</p>
<p>For the past, there are current facts as witnesses: for today, facts will tell us in the future. Since ancient times, no matter how superb the theory, no matter how touching the plan, as long as you compare it with actions and facts, the truth is whether it is right or wrong, everything will be revealed, and there is no way to cover up or obliterate it.</p>
<p>What kind of efforts have we made for the past? I dare not comment on merits and demerits, nor is it necessary to comment. The facts placed before us are that stray children are still filling the streets: in the villages plagued by natural and man-made disasters, the tragedy of exchanging children for food is still constantly happening: "Infant slaughter, apprentice systems equal to slavery, and the pampered and tyrannical, those who open their mouths for food and stretch out their hands for dishes, rich children, form a clear contrast. Regarding children's education, it's either "a stick produces a filial son", beating children into being like a煨灶貓 (a cat warming itself by the stove), or letting them loose like a wild horse, letting them rush and run around recklessly. And the atmosphere of superstition is densely permeated. In order to keep the child from dying, the child's big toe is cut off, saying that it can break the spell of a "debt-collecting ghost," and abandoning corpses in the wilderness is even fresher news not long ago, and also news that has been around for a long time, while the abandonment and abortion of illegitimate children, as well as secretly sending them to orphanages, are not included.</p>
<p>These are what children who live in the mud or live in paradise have encountered. What about the children of the middle class? They "play marbles" in the alley, gamble for petty profits at small candy stalls, and if they don't agree, they will throw a punch. According to the recent statistics released by the Municipal Health Education Committee, among the physical examinations of more than 9,000 students in various elementary schools in this city from September of last year to January of this year, those with deficiencies accounted for slightly less than 90 percent. What an alarming number!</p>
<p>Of course, these are all looking at the shortcomings, but why are there so many shortcomings! For example, the problem of stray children is enough to give sociologists and educators a headache, and there are also other difficult topics such as education problems. Children are the pillars of the future country, but now we find that these beams are crawling with termites.</p>
<p>To choose the good to say, for example, the Little Teacher Movement and the New An Troupe's children learning and living at the same time, of course, have not been without, but again, how rare are they. Moreover, these mostly come from the children's own strength, and the adults can only be ashamed of them.</p>
<p>This is a memorandum. My hopes are not too extravagant. I only hope that on this day next year, we can choose more good things to say, discover fewer termites, and see fewer decaying pillars.</p>
<h3>Heilongjiang Riverside</h3>
<p>— Zou Heng</p>
<p>The river water cleaves two worlds of different colors, carrying a golden, chilling wind, creating a yellow mist over the river, obscuring the scenery on both banks.</p>
<p>Spring has passed, the wind has subsided, the mist unfolds, green fir forests fill the small ridges on both opposing banks, and the already cultivated, single-harvest fields are filled with the new sprouts of sorghum and corn. The sun shines warmly, seemingly oblivious to the disputes between these two different worlds, treating them with the same attitude.</p>
<p>On the south bank, nestled amongst the fir forests, you can see a few simple earthen houses. This is Xu Family Hamlet. The houses are as low as a few shriveled steamed buns, pitifully lying at the foot of the mountain by the river. At the corner of the earthen wall, a watchtower, tall like a tail, stands erect. It used to be a defensive fortification against bandits after the "cutting of the Menglu," but now it serves as a lookout for imperial soldiers. Several imperial soldiers in yellow woolen uniforms, carrying guns, stroll slowly in front of the gate, sometimes glancing across the river, or casually picking up a stone and forcefully throwing it towards the opposite bank. This seems to be a demonstration of force against the enemy across the river, or perhaps they are using it to exercise their arm strength, but the stones always only reach the center of the river before sinking, followed by a weak echo. The river continues to flow peacefully.</p>
<p>Across the river, similarly, a small ridge acts as two natural fortresses, facing each other. At the foot of the mountain and the riverbank, there are also scattered fir forests as tall as a person. Beyond that is an endless Siberian wilderness. In the past, this was only a haunt for semi-civilized fish-skin Tartars and Chinese hunters, but now stone block fortifications have also been built, and soldiers with guns stand guard outside the gates. Naturally, the traces of wild animals and hunters are rarely seen.</p>
<p>Here, as usual, every afternoon, when the last rays of the setting sun dye the river into a brilliant golden wave, an old man with a cane, accompanied by a child of eleven or twelve years old, dragging long, thin shadows, ambles from the distance of the wilderness. He walks all the way to the end of the riverbank before stopping. The old man, as usual, does not say anything, only gazing forcefully towards the opposite bank, but the child cannot remain silent forever, always liking to tug at him and ask a few questions, which are mostly very simple.</p>
<p>"Grandpa, we can see our home again here. When can we go home?"</p>
<p>"Look," the child points to the other side of the river, "there's a flag hanging on our watchtower. Grandpa, can't you see it?"</p>
<p>"Grandpa is old, his eyes are not good anymore, your young child's eyes are sharper - what color is that flag you see?"</p>
<p>"There's red..."</p>
<p>"Red?" the old man asks urgently, evidently this gives him great excitement. "What other colors?"</p>
<p>"There's only one red bead, no other colors at all."</p>
<p>"Ah," the old man sighs heavily, his hands suddenly loosening, his body tilting entirely onto the child.</p>
<p>"Grandpa, what's wrong?" the child asks, supporting the old man's thin body and gently placing him on the stone behind them, so that he can sit peacefully. The old man's head rests against the child's chest, slowly panting. The sudden blow after this extreme excitement has temporarily plunged him into a dazed state.</p>
<p>"Child, we can no longer see our national flag!" the old man says weakly, after catching his breath for a while. The child evidently does not understand, his small mind only focused on the old man's face. He feels that whenever the old man can speak, even the biggest things will be resolved.</p>
<p>The sun gradually hides, a layer of white mist rises on the river, covering the opposite bank with a light veil, earthen houses, watchtowers, small ridges, gradually disappearing into the mist.</p>
<p>"Child, can you still see the flag?" the old man asks, after staring at the river for a while.</p>
<p>"You can't see anything there, even our house is covered by the mist. Grandpa, when can we go home?" These words strike the old man like lightning. He cannot forget his home, never having left it for half his life. Ever since that year the Emperor ascended the throne, fate has been playing tricks on him. Because he did not want to give his family's land to those white-robed Korean bastards, his two sons were beaten to death.</p>
<p>"If we were at home, I'm afraid the corn in the fields would be this tall now," the old man thinks painfully. This river, only a narrow strip of land wide, has kept him in another country.</p>
<p>The mist grows thicker, the river surface a vast expanse of white, like a silver-gray curtain, surrounding the surrounding scenery. The child nestles closely to his great-grandfather, timidly holding the old man's hand, and asks softly:</p>
<p>"Grandpa, let's go back!"</p>
<p>On the way back, the old man uses his left hand to support himself with a cane, his right hand resting on the child's shoulder, stepping on the soft grass path in the thick mist, filled with grief and regret.</p>
<p>The mist remains thick, the river surface reflecting the searchlights on the fortifications, two dark shadows trudging wearily across the wilderness.</p>
