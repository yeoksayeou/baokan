<p>時評</p>
<h3>保衛察哈爾</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>日帝國主義者用其兵力攻下了平津。就其軍事策略講侵略戰爭似己告一段落。目前日帝國主義者唯一的企圖。在政治上是如何收買漢奸。造成一過渡政權。在軍事上。是如何搜索平律地帶二十九軍殘餘部隊。消滅足以威脅其旣獲贓物的障碍。因此日軍在津浦路雖有向楊柳靑獨流良王莊推進模樣。在平漢路雖出動飛機。轟竇店良鄕。涿州保定。但已暫無大舉進攻的策動。旬日以來。平津以南前綫。一時告沉寂者。其原因卽在此。</p>
<p>不過在北平以北為國守土的察主席劉汝明。在日本方面看來還是心腹大患。日來由張垣傳來消息。謂日軍向平綏路集中。似有窺察省模樣。由軍事政策上言之。日人擊潰二十九軍為其現階段的唯一目標。而由地理上言之日人旣得北平。而居庸之險。不在日本人之手。則由張家口開入居庸關的軍隊。一日卽可達北平。這自然足以給侵略者以極大威脅。所以侵略軍隊為保障其安全。集中昌平。向居庸南口推進。在軍事上。變為必有政策。目前平津南面戰事的沉寂。而北面軍事的活躍。就是軍事策略轉移另一方面的事實的表現。</p>
<p>如何保衛察省。如何死守南口居庸。這是全國人們所應關心的。南口居庸關八達嶺之間。兩山聳立。長城蜿蜓於上。平綏路貫穿於下。地勢險要。易守難攻。中國如以大軍守之。日軍雖有飛機坦克。亦將失其效用。同時扼守此險要。攻則可以為將來收復平津的凖備。守則可以保衛察綏的安全。不獨在軍事上所必爭。卽在國家的安全上。我們亦應死守的。</p>
<p>不過我們有兩點應注意的是。㊀劉汝明將軍在張垣懷來宣化等地的軍隊。不足三萬五千人。這些軍隊。一方面將來須與進攻的日本正規軍作戰。他方面也須嚴防在日軍策動下的熱河察北等匪偽軍的南下偸襲後方。如果這樣。那末在兵力上必有不足之虞。為援助察省作戰軍隊。中央應有迅速派大軍出山西綏遠援助的必要。㊁居庸雖居險要。得地理上的優勢。在防禦上自屬較易。不過敵人的利器。我們也須注意到。十五年奉軍與前國民軍作戰國民軍南口之失。據云卽由奉軍利用重砲向南口防禦工程先作密集的射擊。破壞防禦工程。隨後繼之以步隊。國民軍終因此退出南口。此乃往事可鑑者。二十九軍重砲很為缺乏。此次平津應戰。在這方面也吃虧不少。所以我們希望政府對於我們軍事的弱點。迅速補救。而對於二十九軍所最感需要的飛機重砲。源源供給。以我國軍隊士氣之壯。作戰之勇。必能一鼓而殱來犯的醜類同時保存察綏。也在此一舉了。</p>

<p>潘氏致詞</p>
<p>首出主席潘公展氏致歡迎詞、略謂、今天上海市文化界救亡協會、聯合各團體、在此舉行會員談話會的意義有兩點、第一、郭沬若先生離國十年、今日回國、共赴國難、準備重復參加國民革命第二期的工作、我們應該表示熱烈歡迎的、第二、我們同時對於沈鈞儒·章乃器·李公𣝢·以及尚未回滬的四位先生、表示歡迎他們共同參加救亡的工作、我們把這二層意思、在此談話中表示、想各位都有無限的感觸、我國從民國十五年國民革命軍出師北伐到現在、已及十年、這十年之中、正是在一個大轉變的時期中、這大轉變的時期、顯然是負了一個建設獨立自由平等的新中國的使命、其艱鉅可想而知、中國是幾千年專制的國家、近百年來更受帝國主義的侵略和壓迫、要完成國民革命使命、定須經過多少磨抓、我們完成國民革命的使命、大抵可分兩惆段落、第一、對內須把舊有封建割據的勢力、完全剷除、而造成統一的民主的國家、但要造成統一的民主的國家、不能僅注視國內、中國是帝國主義的逐鹿之塲、國民革命的抬頭、當然對於帝國主義的侵略是不利的、一向侵略中國的帝國主義、看到此種情形、一定要想種種方法來阻撓國民革命的發展、故國民革命第二期工作的使命、是對於侵略我們最厲害的帝國主義者、作勢不兩立搏鬭、所以國民革命到現在、還不能算完成、已往十年的努力、也祇能勉强做到第一個階段、完成了第一期的工作、即消除了封建割據因襲勢力、而完成了一個統一的局面、這第一期工作完成之經過一半是靠了我們民衆的努力、和最高領袖的領導、一半也要感謝日本帝國主義者、自九一八到現在六年之中所給予我們的壓迫來促成的、由於帝國主義的侵略、暴露了猙獰的面目、已到滅亡我們的時期、乃使全國上下、不分黨派、不分階級、眞正的覺悟起來、把所有力量集中起來、對侵略我們最烈的帝國主義者、作生死之决鬭、我們相信目前非常時期的到來、全國所表現的力量、一定要超過民國十五六年間的大時代、國民革命第二期中所需要我們全國人民努力的、也一定比第一期更艱苦更偉大、在這時期中、看見離國很久的郭沬若先生回國了、想到他十年前參加國民革命的努力、和十年中間在異國種種悲憤的情緒、現在不顧一切回來、一定抱了很大的决心、來盡力於救亡工作的、同時我們又看到沈鈞儒等七位先生、也安然無恙的回到上海、準備繼續與大家共同致力於救亡工作、我們在此種情緒激越空氣熱烈之中、每個人感到今後需要的只有一點、即大家拿出赤忱團結、本來這樣大的國家、在完成團結的過程中、或因見解之不同、或因方法之有異、而主張先後緩急之不同步驟、原是不足為異的、只要到了大時代降臨的時期、在太苦難加到每個人的頭上的時候、大家能捐除一切成見、團結成一個堅强凝固的隊伍、一定可以負起救亡的使命、因為國家到了今日、民族在生死存亡的時期、如果還不能精誠團結、無異整個民族的自殺、亦即整個國家的自殺、所以我們所希望的、以及用盡種種力量以求達到的、即全國上下一致的為禦侮救亡的最後關頭而努力、為國民革命第二期工作而努力、反對侵略中國的帝國主義者、建立獨立自由平等的新中國、現在大家已明白認識我國外患嚴重、除了抗戰以外、沒有第二條路可走、外面尚有人懷疑“和”“戰”的取捨問題、這實在是不必要的懷疑、現在我國並不是“和”與“不和”的問題、中國民族本來是希望和平的、不特希望遠東和平、希望整個世界和平、不過現在是我們要和平、而人家不要和平、和平一定要在平等的原則之下、才能實現、不平如何能和、不過我們要認識此次的抗戰、是持久的抗戰、是全民族的抗戰每一個人一定要在此次抗戰中、準備着犧牲所有的一切、以貢獻於國家、而文化界人士、還要把這種意思、使每個同胞都明瞭、須知此次戰爭不是兒戲的、不是一時即了的、不是中途可以妥協屈服的、蔣委員長在兩次談話中、明白昭示過我們、是全民拚生死、全國拚存亡的戰爭、則對於必不得已而應戰、如何應付、有關於戰略、普通民衆不能懷疑、不能顧問、也不應干涉的、如果一般民衆都要懷疑過問甚至干涉政府的戰略、那末不必抗戰、已可知其結果、假使連信任軍事領袖戰略的信心都沒有議論盈國、如何可以抗戰呢、硌關於戰略方面的重大責任、祇有信仰政府來全權担任的、在今日情形之下、文化界同人應該信仰政府、準備自己、在危難到臨時、自己做些什麼工作、如何組織民衆、訓練民衆、使民衆到大戰序幕揭開後、不致手足無所措、不致無以貢獻於國家、希望在座各位、以及郭沫若沈衡山等八位先生、都來參加這文化界的救亡運動、在蔣委員長領導下、爭取民族抗戰的最後勝利、</p>
<p>四位演說</p>
<p>略謂、今天承各位熱烈歡迎在沫若實是有生以來第一次很大的光榮、也是最大的慚愧、現在大家談抗敵、我覺得抗敵不在多言、顧力行何如耳、此次抗戰、不僅是軍事的抗戰、文化界以及農工商各界、都應該共同參加這次的抗戰工作、我們文化界要揭破敵人的陰謀和黑幕、同時我們要集中一切的力量、為國家的獨立自由平等而奮鬥、過去大家所以沒有最大的决心、就因為或者有些人把生命財產看得太重、生命看得太重即是怕死財產看得太重、即是愛錢岳武穆有言、文臣不愛錢、武臣不怕死、則天下太平矣、我敢說、人人不怕死、人人不愛錢、則敵人打倒矣、現在全國抗戰、必須在最高領袖領導之下、共盡最大的努力、繼由沈鈞儒演說、略謂、余為國民黨黨員、希望中國國民黨切實領導民衆組織民衆、在國民政府指導之下來抗戰、繼由章乃器演說、希望今後全國國民精誠團結、精神意志行動、均應統一、抗戰必有勝利之把握、李公𣝢演說略謂、不要把敵人的力量估計太高、也不要把敵人的力量估計得太低、大家應精誠團結、受政府的訓練和組織、一致對付敵人、此外尚有返國之日本留學生代表郝子報告日本國內近况、及被迫返國經過、辭長從略、</p>

<h3>Three Japanese Warships Depart Hankow with All Marines</h3>
<p>Our Police Force Enters Japanese Concession in Advance, All Military Equipment Completely Withdrawn, Consulate Staff Seeks Instructions on Whether to Withdraw</p>
<p>[Hankow] The three Japanese warships, "Yaejima," "Hozu," and "Kuri," which had been docked in Hankow, carrying a full complement of 1,000 marines, left Hankow at 3:00 AM on the 8th, led by Commander Mataro Tanimoto, and sailed for Shanghai en route to Japan.  With this, all Japanese military equipment within the Hankow concession has been completely withdrawn.  Thirty members of our police force, led by a police chief and inspectors, entered the concession to protect the consulate.  At 10:00 AM, Wu Guozhen and Chen Xizeng, together with Japanese Consul Matsudaira and others, inspected the Japanese concession for a week. The Japanese consul expressed his gratitude to our side for assisting in the protection of the consulate. All shops and residences within the Japanese concession were closed, and Chinese people generally did not enter the concession, which was like a deserted island. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hankow] After the withdrawal of Japanese soldiers and expatriates, our side dispatched police captain Lan Yuyou and inspector Wan Yong, leading 30 armed police officers, to enter the concession. After consultation with Toshiro, the head of the Japanese police station, they agreed on a location to station themselves and assigned posts. Because this was insufficient, we requested an additional 20 police officers, for a total of 50, to enter the concession for protection. Japanese Consul Matsudaira intended to lower the flag and return to his country and has telegraphed Tokyo for instructions. If he receives approval late in the evening, Matsudaira will lead the consulate and the personnel of the consulates in Sichuan and Hunan on the Yueyang Maru to Shanghai and return to his country on the 9th. The Japanese concession will also be officially taken over by us starting from the 9th. The Japanese concession, which has been leased for 39 years, can in fact be kept by us. Moreover, after the withdrawal of Japanese soldiers, everything in Wuhan has returned to normal. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hankow] Japanese shops and residences outside the Japanese concession are scheduled to be sealed off and guarded by personnel from the Japanese consulate together with our side on the morning of the 9th. Furthermore, our guards surrounding the Japanese concession were completely withdrawn on the 8th, but the defensive works were not removed. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] The Japanese Consul in Hangzhou, Matsumura, following orders from Tokyo, completely withdrew the head of the Japanese police station, Yamakita, and four police officers back to their country. They all left Hangzhou for Shanghai at around 2:00 PM yesterday.  The translator, Huayuan, remained in Hangzhou to work, requesting protection from the Hangzhou municipal authorities. The Japanese concession was temporarily managed by the provincial capital's police bureau, which was responsible for maintaining order. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hankow] After receiving the withdrawal order, the Japanese Navy and expatriates stationed in Hankow departed in the first batch on the afternoon of the 7th, traveling on two ships and two warships. The three ships, the "Yaejima Maru," "Kuri," and "Tsuga," loaded with marines and military supplies, were originally scheduled to leave Hankow at noon on the 8th, but they suddenly set sail earlier, at around 12:00 AM on the 7th. When the marines left Hankow, all the streetlights in the concession were smashed by them with long poles, plunging the concession into darkness. Our police force was originally scheduled to go to the concession to deploy at 8:00 AM on the 8th, but because the Japanese marines withdrew in advance, at around 12:00 AM on the 7th, the 11th Precinct was temporarily dispatched to deploy armed police officers to guard all the main intersections in the concession, prohibiting pedestrians from entering or leaving. At 8:00 AM on the 8th, 30 armed police officers dispatched by the Municipal Police Bureau, led by Captain Lan Yuwen, Inspector Wan Yong, and Ying Jun, an officer from the 13th Precinct, entered the Japanese concession, led by Wang Zhijing, the head of the 11th Precinct. Wan Yong immediately negotiated with the head of the Japanese police station and agreed to temporarily use Yamazaki Street's Meiji Elementary School as our police station. Then, our armed police officers were deployed to various posts within the concession to perform their duties. The original Japanese police officers had gone on strike since the 5th and had been guarded by marines. The head of the Japanese police station then requested more police officers, saying that 30 were not enough. Our side then dispatched an additional 30, for a total of 60, to enter the concession. The Japanese consulate's police personnel and a small number of expatriates, totaling about 100 people, all stayed overnight inside the Japanese consulate on the 7th. The surrounding area was guarded by our police officers, and it was extremely peaceful. At 3:00 PM on the 8th, Mayor Wu Guozhen visited Tadahisa Matsudaira, the acting Japanese consul, to express his willingness to do everything possible to protect the safety of Japanese expatriates. The conversation lasted about half an hour before he left. The Japanese ship Yueyang Maru, which is docked at the Nisshin Pier in the Japanese concession, is now scheduled to carry all the Japanese expatriates remaining in Hankow and leave Hankow on the 9th. However, whether Acting Consul Matsudaira and the consulate staff will withdraw together is something Matsudaira has telegraphed Tokyo about for instructions. He is expected to receive a reply late at night, which will determine his next course of action. It is noted that the Japanese concession was established in the 24th year of Guangxu, i.e., 1898 in the Gregorian calendar, and has been in existence for 39 years. Chen Xizeng, the head of the Municipal Police Bureau, went to the concession on the morning of the 8th to direct everything. At around 1:00 PM, he, together with Chief Inspector Wang Jingfang, Precinct Chiefs Wang Zhijing and Wan Dixiu, and Tian Yadan, went to the Meiji Elementary School to plan everything. They followed the map drawn by the Japanese police station and properly assigned the posts, for a total of 13 posts, and decided to have three patrol teams responsible for patrolling. The boundary between the Japanese concession and the Chinese area was blocked by barbed wire. Every day from 6:00 AM to 7:00 PM, Zhongjie Street would be opened, but except for women, anyone entering would be subject to inspection by police officers, and it was forbidden to take any items out of the concession. From 7:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning, no one was allowed to enter or leave. The reporter inspected the Japanese concession for a week on the 8th. Upon entering through Zhongjie Street and going around for a week, there was not a single person except for our police officers on duty, and the doors and windows of the Japanese shops and residences were tightly closed. The sandbags and barbed wire placed by the Japanese marines at the main intersections had not yet been removed. On the blackboard in the classroom of Meiji Elementary School, the lesson text was still written, and a "Map of the North China Incident" was posted on the wall, with the place names noted in great detail. The iron gate of the gambling den on Yamato Street was still not closed, and several people were sitting inside the iron gate. Another morphine manufacturing machine's parts and boiler had not been removed, but the manufacturer was nowhere to be seen. The once-filthy Huazhong Company on Xin Xiaolu has now been closed. The brothels nearby, which were places where Japanese soldiers used to have fun and were once very lively, now have no trace of people. About ten Indian people, holding seals from the Japanese Consulate, were posting seals on the doors and windows of various Japanese shops and residences facing the street within the concession. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Ministry of the Navy issued a statement at noon on the 8th, stating that according to a telegram from the naval commander stationed in Hankow, the Japanese expatriates in the area have now been completely evacuated, and the Marines and guard ships have decided to accommodate Japanese expatriates from various places downstream of Hankow, escort them down the river, and merge them with the Marines stationed in Shanghai.

<h3>China Aviation Plane "Zhejiang" Crashes</h3>
<p>Forced to Land Midway While Flying from Hong Kong to Shanghai Yesterday Morning, British Destroyer Ordered to Sail from Hong Kong to the Rescue, Eight Passengers Rescued Outside the Zhilan Lighthouse, The Plane's Fuselage Has Been Destroyed, Three Crew Members Missing</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The China National Aviation Corporation plane "Zhejiang" left Hong Kong for Shanghai this morning. At 10:05 AM, it suddenly sent a radio message stating that the plane was forced to land. The Kai Tai airfield, upon receiving the message, immediately notified the British naval authorities. The British destroyer HMS "Salacia" was then ordered to sail out of Hong Kong to provide assistance. At the same time, the British submarine HMS "Otus," which was engaged in exercises in Dapeng Bay, was also ordered to provide assistance. It was expected that the "Zhejiang" plane would be forced to land near Zhilan Cape (transliteration), about 90 miles north of Hong Kong. In the afternoon, the "Salacia" radioed that it had arrived at Zhilan Cape but had not found the plane. Visibility was less than a mile, and the rising tide hindered the search. The destroyer has launched motorboats to search in the nearby bays and ports. Two customs patrol boats also arrived at the scene in the afternoon, but as of 6:45 PM, there was still no sign of the plane. The authorities fear that the plane may have hit rocks when landing. Even if it was not completely destroyed, it must have been damaged. The pilot of the plane was American Smith, his assistant was also an American, and there were also two Chinese radio operators on board, as well as seven passengers. Among them was the American aviator Walsh, who was hired by the Guangdong government. Walsh took the plane with two Chinese in Hong Kong, and the other four, whose names are unknown, started from Guangzhou and were probably all Chinese. (8th Central News Agency Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Reuters has just learned that Smith, the pilot of the China National Aviation Corporation plane "Zhejiang," sent a telegram from the British warship HMS "Salacia," stating that all passengers of the "Zhejiang" had boarded the British warship, but three crew members were missing and may have been rescued by civilian ships. The "Zhejiang" has been destroyed, the telegram said, and also requested medical assistance. It is likely that some of those rescued were injured. (Central News Agency 8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The customs patrol boat sent a radio message tonight saying that the small boat launched by the British warship HMS "Salacia" had rescued passengers from the crashed China National Aviation Corporation plane outside the Zhilan Lighthouse, and that eight people had now been rescued. There were 11 people on the plane, and the fate of the remaining three was not mentioned in the telegram. It is hoped that they will all be rescued later. HMS "Salacia" is expected to return to Hong Kong at 4:00 AM on the 9th, at which time there will be a detailed report. (Central News Agency 8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] The China Aviation plane flying from Guangdong to Shanghai on the morning of the 8th crashed off the coast about ten miles northeast of Hong Kong. Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport received a distress signal at 10:05 AM and notified all parties. A Chinese customs patrol ship immediately sailed to search and rescued eight passengers, who are expected to return to Hong Kong at about 4:00 AM on the 9th. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] There were four pilots and seven passengers on board the crashed China Aviation plane. It is currently only known that eight people have been rescued, and the situation of the remaining three is unclear. There were four Chinese passengers who boarded in Guangdong, including the Shanghai architect Dong Dayou and Huang Tanfu, the director of the Guangdong Cement Factory. Dong followed Wu Tiecheng to Guangdong in July to carry out the architectural design of the provincial government guest house. After the work was completed, he took this plane back to Shanghai.

<h3>Yellow River in Shandong Rises and Breaches Its Banks</h3>
<p>Yellow River Overflowing and Breaching at Three Points in Shouzhang, Rapid Currents, Water Seen on the North Levee</p>
<p>[Jinan] The Yellow River has been rising continuously for days. The water level at Dongzhuang is 59.05 meters, only one centimeter lower than when the breach occurred in 1935. The Baimin Little Levee in Shouzhang County on the north bank first breached at one point, with a width of more than one kilometer.

Water has been seen on the levee on the north bank. One stream flows into Dawang and has reached Nangang in Fan County, and another stream flows down through Shouzhang and back into the main river. When generating electricity, the water is still rising. Leaks have been occurring repeatedly in the levee on the south bank of Changqing, the water level at Luokou is level with the levee, and many dikes downstream have also subsided. Han Fuju has personally gone to Luokou to inspect the water situation. If the levee on the north bank breaches, the water will flow directly to Tianjin. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Long Yun Flew to Chengdu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Fly to Beijing Today</p>
<p>[Chengdu] Yunnan Chairman Long Yun, accompanied by Director of Education Gong Zizhi, Party Committee Member Pei Cunfan, and four others, flew to Chengdu at 5:30 PM on the 8th, and are scheduled to fly to Beijing on the 9th.

I also intend to take the opportunity to state the current situation in the region. I will return to Yunnan in about ten days. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Fabricate Rumors Out of Thin Air</h3>
<p>Everything Reported is Completely Unfounded</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Shanghai-based Japanese newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" on the 8th reported that young military officers and radicals in Nanjing rioted and assassinated Chairman Wang Zhaoming on the morning of the 7th, and that Minister He Yingqin was being monitored. People here are deeply indignant upon hearing this, believing it to be a fabrication intended to confuse the public. Since the Japanese army launched a large-scale invasion of North China, the entire nation, from the government to the people, has been united against the enemy. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, we are of one heart and one mind, facing the national crisis together. The gathering of administrative and military leaders from various regions in the capital these days to personally receive government instructions is clear proof of the unified steps of the nation. This afternoon, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet for the military leaders from various regions who came to the capital, and Chairman Wang attended and gave a speech. This afternoon, Minister He convened generals from various regions at the Ministry of Military Affairs to discuss matters. Everyone unanimously expressed their intention to advance according to the direction indicated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. In short, the Japanese newspaper's fabrication of such absurd and bizarre news is sufficient to demonstrate that it is recklessly speculating about China's political situation with the base mentality of its own February 26th Incident, making it all the more foolish and laughable.

<h3>China's Financial Strength is Solid Enough to Fight Japan</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi's Conversation with American Reporters: Japan's Policy is No Different Than Suicide</p>
<p>[Paris] It is reported that after Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi of China met with French officials, negotiations on China's loans have reached a considerable stage. Mr. Kong said in an interview with a reporter from the Associated Press today, "Japan's aggression is intensifying day by day, but China's currency can still be stable, which shows not only that the Chinese government's financial strength is solid, but also that friendly countries have great confidence in China's future. I believe that if a major war breaks out between China and Japan and lasts for several months, there will be changes in Japan's domestic situation. Not only will the Japanese treasury not be able to support it, but the Japanese people will also realize that the suicide policy of the young military閥 is not worth the loss. China's financial strength is sufficient to resist Japan. If we have to go to war, we can handle it easily. Therefore, China is not pessimistic about the future of the North China Incident." (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Kong Xiangxi, Deputy Prime Minister of the Executive Yuan of China, recently gave an interview to a reporter from the far-right "L'Époque" newspaper, saying, "The current conflict between China and Japan in North China is a new stage in Japan's expansionist policy. The Japanese military dreams of dominating Asia and ultimately controlling the world. Some Japanese politicians also know that using force as an instrument of national policy is an act of madness. However, the young military is rampant for a time. They believe that they have a mission in Asia and are willing to engage in a crazy war, making it impossible for politicians who oppose war to do anything. China has now decided to resist force with force, but the responsibility for the conflict should be borne by Japan. China is now seeking to carry out economic construction, so what it needs is peace. However, it has to resist aggressors. China is not only fighting for its own survival, but also for the justice and law of the world. We are very pleased that European and American countries have expressed sympathy and understanding for China's position. At this point, the momentum of war may not be unstoppable."

<h3>Japan's Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>▲ The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" published a dispatch from Tokyo stating that, from the standpoint of Japanese finance, its position is like a person descending a mountain. At first, it is easy to walk downhill at a leisurely pace, but now it has reached a steep place and must speed up its steps. Whether it can stop its slide down is a serious question, or it may simply plunge into the abyss due to uncontrollable inflation, which is also a matter of course. The indexes of wholesale and retail prices, which are usually regarded as dry materials in special economic reports, have now become the main news of various newspapers, because the public feels that the national financial balance has fallen into danger. One reason for the rising trend of prices in Japan is, of course, the rise in the prices of world minerals, raw materials, and agricultural products. Another reason is indeed the sharp increase in expenditures in this year's budget and the crazy increase in the expenses of the army and navy. The Japanese fiscal year budget for 1937-38, after several months of debate, has been agreed to be 2.872 billion yuan, an increase of about 560 million yuan over the previous year, and almost doubled compared to 1931-32. The army and navy expenses have increased more than threefold, from 454.6 million yuan to 1.411 billion yuan. The percentage of national defense expenditures in the budget has increased from 31 percent to 49 percent. The balance of the budget is due to the fact that the rulers of pseudo-Manchukuo and Japan regard themselves as pacifiers of East Asia and have to expand their military preparations. Since 1931-32, no Minister of Finance has been able to make the budget balance without borrowing, and often the debt accounts for about one-third of the national income. For example, in 1937-38, it is necessary to raise new debts of 965 million yuan. This kind of so-called deficit bond is purchased by the Bank of Japan, and the savings bureau of the Ministry of Finance also absorbs a smaller part. The bureau manages postal savings, so it has surplus funds to purchase government bonds. The Bank of Japan sells them to commercial banks, savings banks, insurance companies, and brokers. The sale of new bonds has been very smooth for several years. Although the cost of living has seen an increase, it has increased gradually and has not caused demands for wage increases, because the Japanese labor organization is very incomplete, and Japanese exporters are in a very good position because of this. After the value of the yen was greatly lowered, selling goods abroad can get more money without having to raise prices. Until recently, wages have not only not risen, but have tended to decline. However, in recent months, the situation has suddenly changed, and the gentle inflation has suddenly turned into a sharp one. The index of retail prices increased from 129.6 to 157.6 between October 1931 and July 1936, and in April 1937, it jumped to 171.9. It increased by 9 percent in nine months. The index of wholesale prices in March 1937 also increased by 25 percent compared to a year ago. The cost of living is so high that workers are gradually becoming unbearable. Strikes across the country, followed by actions demanding wage increases of 10 to 30 percent, are rising like a storm. The government has taken various steps to cope with this situation. The import tax on steel has now been abolished, and this raw material is now being used sparingly. A committee has also been set up to control prices, but whether inflation can be reversed after the tide has turned has become a public question. For years, pessimists have worried that there will be a day when wages in the country will soar and prices will rise sharply. Now this prediction has begun to be realized. Although the army and navy personnel have had their wish for record-breaking expenses fulfilled, the result will be that wages will soar and prices will rise sharply, and their purpose will inevitably be frustrated as a result, because the money paid will be more. Therefore, it is expected that the expenses required by the army and navy in 1938-39 may be greater than the amount listed in the current budget, and the budget may exceed 3 billion yuan. At that time, if a control plan is not strictly implemented, prices will inevitably rise further, and wages and salaries will continue to increase. This is a natural principle. Judging from the current situation, the government seems to be expanding national control over industry and foreign trade. In the near future, it may implement a plan to allocate rice imports by a license system, and will strive to reduce the purchase of dispensable goods abroad, and implement the system of prioritizing the purchase of goods and necessary raw materials needed by the army and navy abroad. (Translator's Note: This dispatch was written before the Japanese parliament passed the 500 million yuan military expenditure for North China. Now that this 500 million yuan expenditure has been added, the finances will of course be even more difficult.)</p>

<h3>Three German Reporters Expelled from Britain</h3>
<p>Germany Unwilling to Let it Rest</p>
<p>[Berlin] Sources said today that the German government is unwilling to let the British expulsion of three German reporters go unanswered. If a protest is not filed, it will ban all British newspapers from entering the country or expel all British reporters from Germany. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>○Berlin Regarding the expulsion of Mr. Langen, a London correspondent for the Berlin newspaper "Der Angriff", by the British government, German political figures have adopted a reserved attitude, only saying that the government has ordered the embassy in Britain to handle this matter. However, German officials have not stated what measures Germany intends to take to retaliate against Britain for this move. Foreigners here believe that there are many foreign journalists who have been expelled by the German government, but the expulsion of foreign journalists by the British is a serious measure. It is difficult to believe that this measure is only due to professional motives. In addition, "National Socialist Party News" commented on this matter, saying that it was a provocative action by Britain, and said, "The British government's attitude towards correspondents from major German National Socialist Party newspapers has to be regarded as an intentional unfriendly action towards the German press. Judging from the personal character and career of Mr. Langen, Britain has no legitimate reason to suddenly stop his professional activities. Not only that, but a German female clerk who worked with Mr. Langen was also not allowed to extend her stay in Britain, which shows that Britain's purpose is to completely stop the work of the National Socialist Party's London office." The newspaper continued, "Mr. Langen previously served as the leader of the German National Socialist Party branch in Rome for many years and was extremely loyal to Italian work. At this moment, the United States is trying to reach an understanding with Italy, but it regards Mr. Langen's work as a thorn in its side, which is really puzzling."

<h3>"Leipzig" Attacked</h3>
<p>German-Italian Plot to Frame / Spanish Government Finds Evidence</p>
<p>⊙Valencia In June of this year, the German government announced that its cruiser "Leipzig" had been repeatedly attacked by torpedoes fired by submarines belonging to the Spanish government off the coast of Oran in French North Africa. Later, Germany used this as a reason to jointly withdraw from the maritime surveillance plan with Italy. The government of Valencia has now found a sailor from the "Leipzig" to testify, proving that this matter was a German-Italian plot, and not the work of a Spanish submarine. According to the sailor, "The captain of the Leipzig prepared to blow up the ship with a torpedo and blame the Spanish government." Regarding this matter, the Ministry of National Defense of the Republican government issued a communiqué stating that, according to the witness, "The captain of the Leipzig had moved the ammunition stored in the hold to the dining room on the deck, so that the hold would be empty and the danger could be reduced when attacked by torpedoes, so that the ship would not be completely destroyed. After this plan was completed, an Italian submarine would fire the torpedoes, because the torpedoes used by the Italian submarines were the same as those used by Spain. In this way, once the torpedoes exploded and damaged the "Leipzig", it could be used to accuse the Spanish government. However, the captain of the "Leipzig" reconsidered and believed that if torpedoes were used to attack, the "Leipzig" might be completely destroyed. Therefore, he changed his mind and only announced that the ship had been attacked by torpedoes fired by a Spanish submarine, but had not been hit, so that people all over the world would believe that the responsibility lay with the Spanish government. In fact, there was no attack at all. In addition, according to the witness, there are many other facts that can be used as evidence. One is that the "Leipzig" was carrying an Italian naval officer who was helping the rebels fight in Spain. The second is that when the ship was docked in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, the sailors on board were prohibited from going ashore. The third is that when the ship sailed, it was escorted by the German gunboat Rainbow. The fourth is that from June 30 to July 7, the sailors on the "Leipzig" were not allowed to send letters to their families. All of these are suspicious points."

<h3>Former Spanish Prime Minister Writes an Article Criticizing Current Cabinet Policies</h3>
<p>⊙City of Belbinan, Southern Region Former Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican government, the leader of the left-wing, Socialist Party, and the Socialist General Labor Union, Caballerro, recently published an article in the Independent Newspaper, vehemently criticizing the military and civilian policies implemented by the Negrín Cabinet, roughly saying, "Although I firmly support the civil war until the final victory, this does not mean unconditional support for the current government. In my opinion, the final victory should be sought outside the various front lines. Taking the Battle of Brunete on the outskirts of the capital and the Battle of Teruel in the northeast as examples, the strategies adopted by the government forces were complete failures and are highly reprehensible. It is especially wrong for the current government to implement repressive measures against the extreme leftists. These people had exhausted their efforts to resist fascism when the civil war broke out. It is unwise to exclude them from the government now. It should be known that although the current attitude of some of these people is not what I approve of, I do not agree to severely punish them without solid evidence. In short, any policy that is full of military errors and causes division among the Spanish working class is not desirable." (Central News Agency Dispatch from Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3>Defending Chahar</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The Japanese imperialists have taken Tianjin and Beiping (Beijing) with their military forces. From a military strategy perspective, the invasion war seems to have come to an end. Currently, the only goals of the Japanese imperialists are: politically, how to buy over traitors to create a transitional regime; militarily, how to search for the remnants of the 29th Army in the Beiping-Lüshun (Dalian) area and eliminate obstacles that threaten their acquired loot. Therefore, although Japanese troops on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway (Jinpu Railway) appear to be advancing towards Yangliuqing, Duliu, and Liangwangzhuang, and aircraft have been dispatched on the Beiping-Hankou Railway (Pinghan Railway) to bomb Doudian, Liangxiang, Zhuozhou, and Baoding, there are no large-scale offensive plans for the time being. For the past ten days or so, the reason for the temporary silence on the front lines south of Beiping lies precisely in this.</p>
<p>However, Liu Ruming, the Chairman of Chahar Province, who is defending the country north of Beiping, is still seen as a major concern by the Japanese. News has been coming from Zhangjiakou that the Japanese army is concentrating on the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway (Pingsui Railway), seemingly contemplating an invasion of Chahar Province. From a military policy perspective, defeating the 29th Army is the sole objective of the Japanese at this stage. Geographically, now that the Japanese have obtained Beiping, and the strategic point of Juyong Pass is not in Japanese hands, troops entering Juyong Pass from Zhangjiakou could reach Beiping in a single day. This naturally poses a great threat to the invaders. Therefore, to ensure their safety, the invading forces have concentrated in Changping and are advancing towards Nankou and Juyong Pass, which has become a necessary military policy. The current silence in the southern Beiping-Tianjin war zone and the active military operations in the north are manifestations of this shift in military strategy.</p>
<p>How to defend Chahar Province and how to defend Nankou and Juyong Pass at all costs are matters that people throughout the country should be concerned about. Between Nankou, Juyong Pass, and Badaling, mountains rise steeply, with the Great Wall winding along their peaks, and the Pingsui Railway running through the valleys below. The terrain is strategic and easy to defend but difficult to attack. If China defends it with a large army, even Japanese aircraft and tanks will be ineffective. At the same time, holding this strategic point can serve as preparation for recovering Beiping and Tianjin in the future. Defending it can protect the safety of Chahar and Suiyuan Provinces. It is not only a military necessity but also crucial for national security, so we must defend it at all costs.</p>
<p>However, we should pay attention to two points. ㊀ General Liu Ruming's troops in Zhangjiakou, Huailai, Xuanhua, and other places number less than 35,000. These troops must not only fight against the attacking Japanese regular army in the future but also strictly guard against the southward attacks of bandit and puppet troops from Rehe and northern Chahar, instigated by the Japanese, to raid the rear. If this happens, there is bound to be a shortage of troops. To assist the Chahar Province war effort, the central government must promptly dispatch a large army from Shanxi and Suiyuan for assistance. ㊁ Although Juyong Pass is strategically located and enjoys geographical advantages, making defense relatively easy, we must also pay attention to the enemy's superior weapons. During the war between the Fengtian Army and the former National Army fifteen years ago, the loss of Nankou by the National Army was said to be due to the Fengtian Army's use of heavy artillery for intensive bombardment of the Nankou defensive works, destroying them. This was followed by infantry attacks, ultimately forcing the National Army to withdraw from Nankou. This is a lesson from the past that should be heeded. The 29th Army is severely lacking in heavy artillery. During the recent defense of Beiping and Tianjin, they suffered greatly in this aspect. Therefore, we hope that the government will quickly remedy our military weaknesses and provide the 29th Army with the aircraft and heavy artillery it desperately needs. With the strong morale and courage of our troops, we will surely be able to annihilate the invading villains in one fell swoop, while preserving Chahar and Suiyuan Provinces. Everything depends on this one action.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Officially Replies to the U.S., Willing to Make Efforts for Peace</h3>
<p>Hoping for International Cooperation to Save the Crisis; Forty Nations Agree with the Hull Declaration</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull reiterated the United States' foreign policy on July 16, emphasizing the promotion of world peace. To date, Britain, France, Russia, and forty nations in Northern and Southern America have notified the U.S. government, expressing unconditional agreement. Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain have not yet responded, which is quite intriguing. However, the diplomatic community does not believe this statement can have any immediate effect. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull, in a written statement to the press on July 16, reiterated the United States' policies regarding the situations in the Far East and Europe. The content included: "We advocate maintaining peace, and we wish to maintain a moderate and calm attitude towards domestic and international issues. We do not wish to use force to resolve any political issues, nor do we wish to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Existing treaties should be respected. If they need to be revised, it should be done through negotiations. Regarding economic issues, we advocate reducing tariff barriers and treating all countries equally. Regarding disarmament, we are prepared to reduce or increase our military strength depending on the extent to which other countries reduce or increase their military strength." After the release of this statement, Germany, Italy, China, Japan, and the Spanish Republican government have not commented on it, which is disappointing to many here. The other thirty-seven countries have submitted replies, generally agreeing with the principles advocated by the United States, especially France, Russia, and the South American countries. Bulgaria and Hungary also advocate revising existing treaties through the League of Nations. In addition, all European countries support the League of Nations. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Litvinov's Reply</h3>
<p>[Moscow] The U.S. Ambassador to Russia notified Litvinov of Secretary of State Hull's statement to the press on July 16 on July 21, and, following instructions from the State Department, asked Litvinov to inform the Ambassador of his views on the principles outlined in the statement. Litvinov replied to the U.S. Ambassador in a letter on July 23, stating that he was deeply grateful to Hull for sharing the content of the statement and that he had paid close attention to its importance and studied it in detail. He noted that the position adopted on various issues was largely consistent with the Soviet government's position, as there was no doubt that international tensions, conflicts, and friction, especially the danger of armed conflicts, might initially involve only two or a few countries but would eventually affect the rights of all countries in the world. This view had already been expressed in Litvinov's principles of indivisible peace and collective security proposed at the League of Nations. Litvinov also agreed with other views in Hull's statement, such as any country should avoid using force to pursue foreign policy, avoid interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, resolve all international issues purely through peaceful negotiations and agreements, consciously abide by international treaties, revise treaty provisions only with the mutual consent of all parties concerned, maintain equality among all countries, and reduce armaments, as they were in line with the principles that the Soviet Union had always advocated and implemented in its foreign policy. For example, the Soviet government had proposed a plan for universal and complete disarmament and partial arms reduction in Geneva ten years ago, and later proposed the establishment of a permanent peace conference in Geneva. If necessary, the cooperative measures mentioned by Hull could be implemented within the framework of that conference. The current international situation is full of crises that endanger world peace and are constantly erupting suddenly in various places. In Litvinov's view, it is necessary for all countries to jointly and vigorously resist them in order to save the situation. Such resistance actions and the revitalization of the League of Nations can take various forms, such as local mutual assistance pacts and other agreements. Among the various forms, Litvinov repeatedly emphasized that all countries that sincerely uphold peace should periodically and simultaneously express their solidarity and willingness to maintain peace. Litvinov concluded by stating that the Soviet government is always ready to participate in such expressions and to contribute to international peace. (TASS, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S.-Soviet Relations Are Becoming More Consolidated</h3>
<p>Russia Orders Warships from the U.S.; Trade Volume Between the Two Countries Increases</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Pravda commented on the new U.S.-Soviet trade agreement signed on August 4, stating, "This new trade agreement is an important and progressive development for the improvement and normalization of commercial relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Its nature and content broaden the foundation of U.S.-Soviet commercial relations because the U.S. has recognized that Soviet goods entering the U.S. should receive unconditional most-favored-nation treatment, and the Soviet Union does the same for U.S. goods. The total trade volume between the U.S. and the Soviet Union has increased significantly in the past two years, and the transpolar flight of Soviet aviators between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, as well as the visit of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet to the Soviet Far East, have further promoted the consolidation of U.S.-Soviet relations. With the signing of this new trade agreement, the friendship between the two countries will inevitably have further development." (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>[New York] The New York Times recently reported that a Soviet delegation is negotiating with U.S. shipyards to order three battleships, each equipped with ten 16-inch caliber guns. The cost will be between $100 million and $200 million. U.S. officials initially objected, but later withdrew their objections. The Soviet government originally intended to order one 35,000-ton battleship equipped with nine 16-inch caliber guns but has now changed its order to three battleships. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>Finnish Foreign Minister to Visit Berlin</h3>
<p>⊙ Helsinki. According to local newspapers, Finnish Foreign Minister Holsti will visit Berlin in the near future.

<h3>French Finance Minister Reports on Financial Situation</h3>
<p>Promoting Economic Policies; Recovery Is Not Far Away</p>
<p>[Paris] French Prime Minister Chautemps, in his cabinet declaration, stated that the financial situation had been resolved. He said that the budget had been balanced, French credit had been restored to a considerable extent, and the treasury position was very solid. "Therefore, the first step of my work has been completed happily," said Chautemps. Chautemps also stated that his talks with both labor and management had given hope of curbing the rise in living standards. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>⊙ Perigueux. The local branch of the Radical Socialist Party recently held a meeting, where Finance Minister Bonnet delivered a speech, explaining the financial situation of France in the past six weeks. He said that on June 28 of this year, several newspapers in England and the United States published news with alarming headlines, predicting the collapse of the franc, which was fortunately avoided thanks to the French government's clear and courageous attitude. The government has now managed to stop the outflow of capital and bring back hundreds of millions of francs of capital that had flowed abroad. In terms of exchange rates, the forward price of the pound sterling has been reduced from ten francs to three francs. Domestic interest rates have been reduced, and the market price of domestic public bonds has risen by nearly 20 percent. In addition, the people are enthusiastically subscribing to treasury bills again, and the amount of savings deposits is greater than the amount of withdrawals. All of these are achievements of the government. "I am well aware that the financial situation is like a newly recovered patient, not yet fully restored. A little carelessness will hinder the achievements we have made. Therefore, the policy of temporarily suspending social reform projects must not be abandoned for a moment."

<h3>Duke of Kent Arrives in Austria</h3>
<p>Transfers to the South to Meet Prince Paul</p>
<p>[Vienna] The Duke and Duchess of Kent, the fourth brother of the British King, arrived here by car from Poland. They immediately went to Carinthia in the south to transfer to Bled, Yugoslavia, to meet with Prince Paul, the first regent of Yugoslavia. (Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Heir to the Polish Throne</h3>
<p>Polish Royalists Favor the Duke of Windsor</p>
<p>[London] The "Sunday Referee" recently published shocking news, claiming that there are widespread rumors abroad that the Polish royalists will soon ask the Duke of Windsor, the former British King, to accept the Polish throne. The party originally favored the Duke of Kent, the fourth brother of the British King, and discussed the matter with him when the Duke and Duchess visited Poland recently. However, because the Duke of Kent was not in a position to accept a foreign throne, they then favored the Duke of Windsor. According to custom, the heir to the Polish throne must be elected. Although the number of royalists in the country is limited, many of them are wealthy aristocrats and are very active politically, so their power should not be underestimated. However, it is feared that the Soviet Union and the German National Socialist government will come out and oppose it. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>U.S. Lower Court Reform Bill Passes the Senate</h3>
<p>Adopted by Non-Voting Method; Months of Stalemate Ends</p>
<p>[Washington] The debate over judicial reform in Congress has been unprecedented in recent years. After President Roosevelt's proposal was returned to the Senate Judiciary Committee for review, the Senate submitted an alternative bill. Today, Vice President Garner suddenly passed the bill by a non-voting method, ending months of stalemate, and surprising many senators who were at a loss. At today's Senate session, Democratic Senator McCarran proposed several amendments. After the amendments were passed, the Vice President declared that if there were no objections, the original bill had been read three times and would be considered passed. The chamber was silent for several seconds, and the Vice President struck the gavel on the chairman's desk, indicating that the bill had been passed. Democratic Senator Guffey stood up to request a vote, but it was too late. The bill has now been sent to the House for consideration. As for the content of the bill, it only concerns the reform of the lower courts and has nothing to do with the number of Supreme Court justices advocated by the President.

The chapter on last year's Arab national unrest was completed today. British representative Hall answered several questions raised by experts, stating that the funds used by the Arab strikers and for purchasing arms were raised through public donations, a common practice in Palestine. The Mandates Commission is scheduled to continue meeting next week to discuss other chapters of the report. (Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Transatlantic Air Service Likely to Be Delayed</h3>
<p>[Washington] The establishment of a regular transatlantic air service by the U.S. Pan American Airways and the British Imperial Airways has been prepared by sending aircraft for mutual testing. However, recently there have been disagreements among the various parties in the United States, which will inevitably delay the opening date of this air service. Regarding this matter, the U.S. Department of Commerce is unwilling to grant a monopoly to Pan American Airways. Aircraft manufacturers also say that the monopoly system is not compatible with national defense needs, and that domestic seaplanes can only be easily sold through competition. If a monopoly system is implemented, the sales of the company's products will inevitably shrink. The State Department still firmly advocates the monopoly system, and said that several U.S. airlines had previously requested permission from the British government to fly over British territory, but all were rejected. The British government granted Imperial Airways the exclusive rights to fly over the British Bermudas and Newfoundland. As such, as far as the British government is concerned, only Imperial Airways can actually enjoy the U.S. government's permit to operate the transatlantic air service, and Pan American Airways must cooperate with it to be effective. Regarding this matter, people are generally afraid that such diverse opinions will shake the agreement already signed between Imperial Airways and Pan American Airways. (Central News Agency, 7th)</p>

<h3>The Withdrawal of Armed Forces from the Japanese Concession in Hankou</h3>
<p>All Military and Civilians Withdraw; Consulate Staff Temporarily Remain; Our Side Dispatches 30 Police Officers to Protect the Concession</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao (Marco Polo Bridge) Incident by the Japanese army, Japanese nationals in Hankou have implemented land and water defense measures. The number of warships in the river has increased to five, and the navy frequently conducts various tactical exercises on land. Martial law has been declared in the Japanese concession, with barbed wire and sandbags piled up at street corners. In particular, the air defense exercises on the 5th and 6th nights, with lights off and cannons firing, were extremely tense. Moreover, Japanese consuls from Chongqing, Changsha, Yichang, and Shashi gathered in Hankou for meetings, which were also of great significance. Judging from the tense situation, they seemed to be planning to disturb our rear. Unexpectedly, today (the 7th), they suddenly and voluntarily disarmed and withdrew all military and civilians, and the serious situation has suddenly eased. This is truly unexpected. However, the proposal for the Japanese withdrawal has been brewing for a long time, but it has not been announced, so outsiders are unaware. Previously, the Japanese side was actively preparing for war in Hankou, and our side was determined to respond calmly. The British, American, and French consuls in Hankou, aware that a crisis could erupt at any moment, voluntarily worked for peace and asked Japanese Consul Tadahisa Matsudaira to move the Japanese army away from Hankou. As for the Japanese concession, they asked our government to assist the Japanese police in providing protection. This proposal had not been implemented for a long time. On the evening of the 6th, at 11:30 p.m., Japanese Consul Matsudaira visited Hankou Mayor Wu Guozhen and said that he had received a telegram from Tokyo ordering all Japanese nationals in Hankou to return home on the 7th. Three of the five Japanese warships anchored in Hankou would escort them downstream, and the Japanese navy would also withdraw completely on the 8th. However, the staff of the Japanese consulate and the consular offices in Kawamachi, as well as the police, would remain in Hankou, and requested that the Chinese side send police to protect the consulate and the Japanese concession. At 10:30 a.m. on the 7th, Mayor Wu led Police Chief Chen Xizeng to visit Matsudaira to discuss the withdrawal of Japanese troops. They immediately agreed on five measures: ㊀ When the navy withdraws on the morning of the 7th, our side will cut off traffic around the concession to avoid disputes. ㊁ The police personnel of the Japanese consulate and the concession will not be withdrawn for the time being, totaling about 100 people, including the staff of the consulates in Chongqing, Changsha, Yichang, and Shashi. ㊂ The Nisshin Company's Yoyang Maru will remain temporarily in Hankou for the use of the consulate staff to withdraw. ㊃ After the navy withdraws, our side will send 20 police officers to the concession to cooperate with the Japanese police in maintaining order. ㊄ The Japanese consulate staff must await the final telegram from Tokyo before withdrawing. At that time, the Japanese consulate will send a letter to the municipal government to formally take over and manage the concession. The Japanese naval landing force then began to transport military equipment and supplies from the concession to the warships. All five or six hundred Japanese nationals boarded the Zuiyo Maru and Iyo Maru. At 3:30 p.m., the Zuiyo Maru and Iyo Maru sailed east, escorted by the Japanese warships Hira and a second, carrying a portion of the landing force and military equipment and supplies. At this point, all Japanese nationals had left Hankou, and the Japanese army had also begun to withdraw a portion of its troops. When the Japanese warships and ships left Hankou, the barbed wire and sandbags in the Japanese concession remained in place as usual, and the security inside and outside the concession was maintained by Japanese and Chinese police. Chinese people were prohibited from entering, and those leaving the concession were prohibited from carrying items. The Garrison Command also imposed considerable martial law near the Japanese concession that evening, prohibiting local hooligans from entering the Japanese concession and notifying officers and soldiers not to enter the residences and gardens of Japanese nationals remaining in Hankou and to ensure their protection without any improper behavior. The Japanese warships Yaeyama, Hozukuri, and three others are scheduled to transport the remaining Japanese troops east at 11:00 a.m. on the 8th. Our side's 30 police officers, led by a police chief and an inspector, will simultaneously enter the Japanese concession to maintain order. Wu Guozhen and Chen Xizeng are scheduled to personally inspect the Japanese concession at 1:00 p.m. This Japanese withdrawal was swift and voluntary, but the mediation of the British, American, and French consuls also played a powerful role. With all Japanese nationals returning home, Japanese shops, factories, and banks have all closed, and the Dojinkai Hospital has also closed. The indoor items are entrusted to others for safekeeping by the Japanese merchants themselves, and our side is only responsible for outdoor protection. After the Taian Cotton Mill stopped production, the Japanese consul requested the municipal government to send personnel to cooperate with the municipal party headquarters to agree on paying each worker one month's salary for dismissal.

<h3>Guangdong Province Officials and Civilians Prepare for War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Repeatedly Protests Patriotic Movements; Japanese Businesses in Shameen Virtually Shut Down; Mass Organizations Prepare for Wartime Work</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Patriotic movements among the people here have become increasingly fervent recently. Ship workers have unanimously refused to load and unload goods for the Japanese. The Japanese Consul-General in Guangdong has lodged verbal protests with our authorities and planned to recruit dozens of Japanese workers from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, but to no avail. Furthermore, the various sectors of the public are intensifying the work of the Resistance Against Aggression and National Salvation Association. Branches have been established in over fifty counties and cities. Each branch has further organized teams for national salvation work, deeply embedding the national salvation movement among the people. Unexpectedly, this move has also aroused the dissatisfaction of the Japanese Consul-General in Guangdong, who has repeatedly raised objections with the provincial government and the Special Commissioner's Office for Foreign Affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi. Our authorities responded by stating that the people's national salvation movement stems from patriotic sentiments, and the government is not in a position to suppress it. All this demonstrates the Japanese side's interference in our affairs. As for the Japanese residents in Shameen, apart from a small number who have left Guangzhou, the remaining few Japanese merchants are observing the situation to decide their course of action. However, the Japanese warship "Sagami" anchored at White Swan Pool and the newly arrived Japanese warship "Sanae" in Guangdong are both preparing to receive orders to carry Japanese residents out of the country. Recently, merchants who used to trade in enemy goods have voluntarily ceased transactions, and employees working for foreign companies have also voluntarily resigned. Therefore, in recent days, the business institutions of enemy countries in Shameen have virtually closed down. Japanese merchants, unable to operate, have been taking their families to Hong Kong for days. The Hong Kong and Guangzhou Steamboat Company, in order to prevent misunderstandings between the people of the two countries, has restricted Japanese residents from purchasing ordinary cabin tickets, only selling them staterooms, so as to satisfy both sides. Furthermore, mass organizations, such as the Seamen's Union, the Clan Property Workers, the Waitresses of Restaurants and Tea Houses, the Machine Workers' Union, and the student community, are either reducing food consumption and donating funds, or contributing one day's earnings. The Bahe Cantonese Opera Association has already handed over 1,000 yuan raised from performances to the Resistance Against Aggression and National Salvation Association, to be forwarded to the front lines. As for preparations for wartime work, the hospitals and the Women's National Defense Work Association have separately organized rescue teams. The Homemade Kerosene Industry Association is preparing for the supply of wartime fuel. The Salt Merchants Association is preparing hundreds of thousands of dan of salt for reserve use. As for food, the authorities have issued orders to all counties and cities to replenish their granaries as soon as possible and to select civilian houses and temples as temporary warehouses. Automobile transportation in Guangzhou City is preparing to implement control when necessary. The police bureau's coolies have been intensifying their training in stretcher techniques for days. After the training is completed, they will further train rickshaw pullers in the city. Government offices and provincial factories have made proper arrangements for air defense equipment. Ordinary security precautions are also being implemented at night in areas with a concentration of government agencies in the city. Market prices have become expensive due to the surge in the Hong Kong exchange rate. Rice, flour, yarn, and other goods imported from outside the province have all seen price increases compared to before. Fortunately, business in the market is as usual, and there is no sense of tension. (August 5th)</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Repairing Dangerous Coastal Dikes</p>
<p>The sea dikes and embankments along the coast of western Zhejiang were eroded by strong winds and waves a few days ago. The east gate of Haiyan and the soil attached to the dikes, as well as the "Xiyi Shi Nan" marked stone dikes, were all washed away. Later, the Seawall Engineering Office, in conjunction with the county government, hired a large number of civilians to work hard to rescue them. The dangers were averted one after another, and fortunately, no major disaster was caused. The top layer of the "Shuo Gan Wu" marked wood dikes is being reinforced, and it can be completed in one or two days. The "Xiyi" marked sloping stone dikes are to be rebuilt into new sloping dikes to resist the tide, which will be completed within two weeks. The "Shi Nan" marked stone dikes can also be repaired in the short term.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Civil Servants Swear Allegiance to the Nation</p>
<p>Civil servants from various agencies in this county held a swearing-in ceremony at Sun Yat-sen Hall at 2:00 p.m. on the 6th. More than 500 people attended. Led by County Magistrate Wen, the ceremony was conducted in due form. He then reported on the significance of holding the swearing-in ceremony. Subsequently, Section Chief Zhang Binyang, Special Commissioner Zhu, and Director Cai of the Finance and Property Department gave speeches, filled with emotion.

<p>The Resistance and Assistance Association is Established</p>
<p>The various sectors of the anti-aggression assistance association held an inaugural meeting at Sun Yat-sen Hall on the 4th. Many people attended and made speeches on stage, filled with indignation. Nine standing committee members were elected on the spot and divided into five departments: General Affairs, Propaganda, Comfort, Investigation, and Discipline, each with a director and two deputy directors. They immediately began to work in their respective departments and conveyed their support for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's proposals to resist aggression and defend against insults, stating that the enemy is pressing on Pingjin, posing a dire calamity. Furthermore, they are increasing troops and transporting equipment, intending to launch a major offensive. Hopes for peace are completely dashed, and seeking complete preservation is impossible. The nation's survival is at stake, at the critical moment. Now is the time. Your Excellency has made two declarations, clearly stating four proposals to implement national policy and resist the war to the end. The people of Lan County, upholding the responsibility of every citizen, vow to use their blood and heads to support the government.</p>

<h3>News of the Japanese Army Spying on the Central Jinpu Railway Line Is Quiet</h3>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Attempt to Land in Qingdao and Yantai Without Success; Jinan People's Hearts Are Stable and the Market Is Normal</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the abandonment of Pingjin, the Japanese side is still dispatching troops and generals, hoping to make further strategic advances. However, judging from the recent situation, Japanese warplanes are flying over and bombing along the Ping-Sui and Ping-Han lines. On the Jinpu Railway line, apart from a few Japanese aircraft coming south for reconnaissance and occasionally strafing trains, there has been no other action. It seems that they hope to first spy on Sui, and after achieving their goal, then invade south. Therefore, the news on the Jinpu Railway line is quiet, turning into a temporary state of inertia.</p>
<p>It was rumored some time ago that two divisions of Japanese soldiers would come to Shandong and land in Qingdao, but in reality, it is not so serious. Although there are not a few Japanese warships in Qingdao, Yantai, and along the coast, some of their soldiers wanted to land with weapons, but after peaceful dissuasion from our side, they did not land.</p>
<p>Since July 31, Japanese aircraft have come to Shandong for reconnaissance on several occasions. Also, on July 31, two sections of the railway were dismantled by plainclothes soldiers carrying guns at the turn of the railway outside the Duliuzhen railway station on the Jinpu Railway. It is said that several White Russian soldiers also participated in dismantling the road. Others say that the 38th Division of the 29th Army dismantled it to stop the Japanese army from coming south. On the same day, a traffic vehicle traveling north from Cangzhou, Shandong, derailed and overturned at the scene. One driver was killed and two firemen were injured. At that time, because the security teams north of Dezhou were mostly unarmed and unable to capture them, the Jinghai County Police Department, upon hearing the news, sent police to pursue them, but they were nowhere to be seen. Only four suspicious women were captured. It is now planned that the Jinpu Railway will repair the road, and permission has been obtained from the 38th Division. Materials were transported there on the 6th, and it may be repaired soon.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the citizens of Jinan were once panicked. The reasons are nothing more than threefold: ㊀ All Japanese women and children along the Jinan and Jiaoji Railways suddenly evacuated; ㊁ Soldiers in Shandong sent their families back to their hometowns; ㊂ Japanese aircraft came to Shandong for reconnaissance, fearing the outbreak of war and Japanese bombing. Therefore, they sent their families to outer counties or nearby villages for temporary shelter. As a result, passengers on the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways were crowded, with people everywhere. Some waited for one or three days without being able to board the train. However, young and strong men all stayed in Jinan, willing to sacrifice themselves for the country. Intellectual women also organized rescue teams, preparing to serve the country. But now the people of Jinan are gradually becoming stable, and the market is as usual. (6th)</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Acceptance of the Canal Returning to the River Dams</p>
<p>Since the start of the project to dismantle the compartments of the dams along the northern Jiangsu Canal, such as the Bihubo, Fenghuang, Lanjia, and Chushan dams, the Bihubo and Lanjia dams have been found to be extensively damaged during the demolition process due to the length of the dam body, the rotting and breakage of the wood, and repeated erosion by wind and tides. The estimated quantity was exceeded, and a revised estimate was made. It is now known that the Chushan Dam and the Lanjia Dam have been completed long ago, and the Bihubo and Fenghuang dams will also be completed on the 6th. The provincial government has sent Xu Jinting to accept them. As for this year's spring repair project for the Zhunpi section, the Canal Engineering Bureau has sent personnel to reassess it, estimating 55,930 cubic meters of earthwork, requiring more than 18,000 yuan in expenses.</p>

<p>A Ferryboat of the Zhentai Class Sinks After a Collision</p>
<p>A small ferryboat of the Zhentai class, towed by two tugboats from Zhenjiang on the 6th, fully loaded with people, sailed into the Guazhou Estuary at about 10:00 a.m. When it reached the Chenjiawan turning point in the second district of Jiangdu, the last tugboat suddenly struck a reef, and the hull was damaged and formed a hole, immediately sinking. Fortunately, the boat was not far from the shore, and the passengers scrambled to escape to the shore, so there were no deaths. However, because the boat had sunk into the water, the luggage was heavy and could not be moved. The Joint Business Office of the Ferryboat Industry has sent employees to take care of it, so as to salvage and repair the hull.</p>
<h3>Lishui</h3>
<p>Suspected Traitor Arrested</p>
<p>On the evening of the 5th, in a remote alley in the east of the city where there were few people, a suspicious man was lingering. When he was interrogated by the police, he stammered. A square sign with a red circle in the middle was found in his luggage, which was highly suspicious of being a traitor. The police then took him to the county government for interrogation. At 9:00 p.m. that night, a special court was convened to interrogate him. According to his confession, his name was Wang Shouqi, thirteen years old, from Yancheng, making a living selling patterns. His words were inconsistent, and he was burly and looked fierce, definitely not a good person. He was immediately detained. Evidence is now being investigated, and he will be dealt with strictly according to the law.</p>

The county has now considered the importance of the road and sent a special technician to lead the workers to Fengxian to make slight changes to the original roadbed, ordering the pavement to be laid within two months to facilitate traffic.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Water Levels Continue to Rise in Various Rivers</p>
<p>Xu Dingkang, Director of the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, previously stated that the Yi, Si, and Shu Rivers were rising simultaneously, posing a danger to the dikes of each river.

If necessary, he plans to open the Lanjia Bihubo Dam to prevent flooding. As for the water levels of each river on the 4th, they are as follows: Jiyishan, Hukou, and Hanzhuang 3.12 meters, Yaowan 22.59 meters, Suqian 19.48 meters, Qingjiang Main Gate water storage 2 zhang, 1 chi, and 2 cun, Gaoyou Yumatou water storage 9 chi and 6 cun, and Sangu Gate water storage - 1 zhang, 3 chi, and 7 cun. However, every day, Director Xu, based on the telegrams from the Pizhou section of the construction site, has ordered the counties along the canal to quickly conscript labor and accumulate soil to prepare for contingencies.</p>
<p>Monks Bravely Endure Training in the Rain</p>
<p>Since the monks of the major temples here were ordered to receive training, two months have passed in an instant. The training sites are the Qilu Temple and Juejin Temple outside the East Wei, etc. There are more than 1,000 monks, and the results are excellent. On the morning of the 4th, Wang Depu, the seventh district commissioner and commander of the security forces, summoned the monks receiving training to give a speech. On that day, a strong wind happened to pass through, and the rain poured down. The young monks lined up in the heavy rain and entered the city, with the order not disturbed at all. They also held their chests and stomachs high, full of energy, to the Zhunyin Normal School in the west gate of the city. After Commander Wang gave a speech, they returned to the outside of the East Wei in formation and dispersed.</p>

Zou went directly to the private residence of Zou Lin, the son of Cai, on Gaoen Road, while Cai and Commander Yang went to Yang's private residence to rest. Cai was wearing a beige suit, a light blue shirt, and although his hair was gray, his heroic spirit was undiminished.</p>
<p>Accompanied Personnel</p>
<p>Those who arrived in Shanghai on the same ship with Zou and Cai yesterday included: former 19th Route Army Tan Qixiu, former 19th Route Army Deputy Division Commander Li Shengzong, former 19th Route Army Director of the Management Office Ye Shaoquan, Sun Yat-sen University Secretary Cheng Hongxuan, Central Supervisory Committee member Hu Wencan, Guangdong Agricultural Tax Bureau Director Lu Wenlan, former Guangdong Arsenal Director Deng Yancun, Sun Yat-sen University Professor Cai Qiunong, physician Xu Yun, and Gan Jiehou, among others.</p>

Song then hosted a banquet at his private residence on Qiqi Road at 7 p.m. that night to welcome Cai and invited Tan Qixiu and Shen Guanghan to accompany him. The hosts and guests enjoyed themselves until about 9 p.m. before dispersing.</p>
<p>Separate Routes to Beijing</p>
<p>Zou took the night express train attached to a floral car to Beijing at 11 p.m. that night. Those traveling with him included Cheng Hongxuan, Xie Mingzhang, Cai Qiunong, and Xu Yun, among others. Cai is scheduled to proceed to Beijing today with Tan Qixiu, Shen Guanghan, Li Shengzong, and Ye Shaoquan. As for Zhang Yan, he had already arrived in Beijing a few days ago.</p>
<p>Zou's Remarks</p>
<p>Zou said in a statement on the ship: "I am returning to Beijing this time because North China is already at war with Japan. This kind of warfare is not only for the survival of the nation, but also to eliminate pests for the people of the world. Japan's consistent policy is not only to annex the entire China, but also to disrupt the world, especially to harm the world's human culture. The fact that Japan wantonly burned down Nankai University after seizing Pingjin is clear. Therefore, our resistance to Japan is on the one hand to seek the revival of the nation, and on the other hand to protect the world's culture. We have these two responsibilities, so the war against Japan is a unanimous one throughout the country, and it is very brave and enthusiastic. As for the method of resistance, China has a whole decision, especially Chairman Chiang's first symposium in Lushan, and the talk on the 29th of last month, which are more clear. Our resistance to the war should follow this policy and its methods, and we believe that the final victory will belong to our country. "Someone asked me last year at the World University Conference and the World Education Conference, I advocated mutual assistance and opposed war. I advocated resistance to Japan. I didn't know that we were resisting and punishing those who were full of ambition, exterminating reason, disrupting world justice, and destroying human culture. That is the way to maintain world peace. Therefore, our resistance in the war now, all countries and nations that uphold justice and love culture in the world, I believe that there is no one who does not express sympathy.</p>
<p>Cai's Remarks</p>
<p>Cai said in a statement on the ship: (Question) General Cai, what is your opinion on the war of resistance this time when you enter Beijing? (Answer) ㊀ I am entering Beijing this time because the people of the whole country are united in the determination of the central government to resist Japan and are jointly going to the national crisis. I am a soldier, and although I am in the field, I dare not give up my duty. Moreover, I have always advocated resisting the violence of Japan, and I am now more responsible. In order to implement my consistent proposition, I should stand on the front line and deal with the enemy. ㊁ As for the people, I think that no matter where they are, they must be calm. Any level of people who are nationals should be responsible for each individual's responsibility, working together and doing their best for the survival and independence of our nation, even at the cost of the greatest sacrifice. As for my comrades in arms, whether in or out of office, we should all rise up with the revolutionary spirit of the past, sharing the same hatred, and under the leadership of the supreme military leader of the country, move forward according to the established plan. Even if we fight to the last soldier, we should resist to the end. If we hold on tightly and do not slack off, we believe that the final victory will belong to us. ㊂ For the whole-of-nation resistance to the enemy, all nationals must unite and give full play to the patriotic spirit and serve the country. Be careful of those who are greedy for small profits and are used by the enemy. I especially put forward this point because during the Songhu War of Resistance, a few ignorant people actually acted as enemy spies and guides, helping the enemy to do evil. How painful it is!</p>
<p>Gan's Statement</p>
<p>Gan Jiehou, a counselor of the Fifth Route Army, was summoned by Chongxi and arrived in Shanghai on the same ship with Zou and Cai yesterday. The reporter asked about his observations on the outbreak of a full-scale war between China and Japan and international relations. Gan said that the question was complex and difficult to answer in a short language. He planned to publish it in detail in writing today. Gan is scheduled to advance to Beijing tonight to meet with Bai. As for the rumor that Li Jishen is coming north, Gan said that he had not heard that Li had entered Beijing when he left Hong Kong.</p>

All radio stations of the company in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shanwei could not communicate with the aircraft. The Hong Kong station was ordered to telegraph the nearby customs and the British Navy ship to Shanwei to find it and ask for assistance. At 8:00 p.m., the company received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that the aircraft had been found near Shanwei, but the aircraft had been damaged. Fortunately, all seven passengers were safe.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Enthusiastic Welcome for Guo, Shen, and Others from the Cultural Circles of This City</h3>
<p>Pan Says the People Need Not Doubt Peace or War; Guo Says Resisting the Enemy Needs Little Talk, Only Action</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cultural Circles' National Salvation Association held a general membership discussion meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday in the auditorium of Shangwen Elementary School. At the same time, it joined with various cultural organizations to welcome Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, and others. A large crowd attended, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered a welcoming speech, and Guo, Shen, Zhang, and Li all gave speeches. The audience responded with thunderous applause at their impassioned remarks. The situation was quite tense. Details of the event are recorded below:</p>
<p>Participating Public</p>
<p>The attending groups included the Cultural Circles' National Salvation Association, the Chinese Literature and Art Association, the Shanghai Constitutional Advancement Association, and the Playwrights Association. Those welcomed included Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, and Li Gongpu. Representatives attending included Pan Gongzhan, Zhou Chuangyun, Xie Liuyi, Ouyang Yuqian, Zhang Zhirang, Qian Junrui, Zhou Hanmei, Zhang Dingfu, Shen Nianjiu, Ye Lingfeng, Zhang Tianyi, Hu Ziying, Sheng Cheng, Jin Zeren, Li Liewen, Mao Dun, Song Zhidi, You Jing, Wu Han, A Ying, Shi Chu, Jiang Ping, Hu Yuzhi, Zhu Qinglai, Yao Huanong, Zeng Xubai, Sa Kongliao, Jin Zhonghua, Chen Dongbai, Qian Yishi, Guan Lu, Sun Zuji, Ba Jin, and nearly a thousand others. The presidium included Pan Gongzhan, Hu Yuzhi, Zhang Zhirang, Zhu Qinglai, Tong Hanmei, Xie Liuyi, and Ye Lingfeng.</p>
<p>Pan's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered the welcoming speech, stating that the significance of the Shanghai Cultural Circles' National Salvation Association joining with various groups to hold this membership discussion meeting was twofold: First, Mr. Guo Moruo has been abroad for ten years. Today, he returns to the country to jointly face national difficulties and prepare to rejoin the second phase of the National Revolution. We should express our enthusiastic welcome. Second, we also welcome Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Li Gongpu, and the four gentlemen who have not yet returned to Shanghai to participate in the work of national salvation together. We express these two sentiments in this discussion. I believe everyone has infinite feelings. From the time the National Revolutionary Army launched the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China to the present, ten years have passed. These ten years have been a period of great transformation, clearly burdened with the mission of building a new China of independence, freedom, and equality. The arduousness of this task can be imagined. China is a country with thousands of years of autocracy, and in the last hundred years, it has suffered from the aggression and oppression of imperialism. To complete the mission of the National Revolution, we must go through much tribulation. The mission of completing the National Revolution can be roughly divided into two stages. First, internally, we must completely eradicate the old feudal separatist forces and create a unified and democratic country. However, to create a unified and democratic country, we cannot only focus on domestic matters. China is a hunting ground for imperialists. The rise of the National Revolution is, of course, detrimental to imperialist aggression. Imperialists who have always invaded China, seeing this situation, will definitely try various methods to obstruct the development of the National Revolution. Therefore, the mission of the second phase of the National Revolution is to engage in an irreconcilable struggle against the imperialists who aggress against us most severely. Therefore, the National Revolution cannot be considered complete even now. The efforts of the past ten years have only barely achieved the first stage, completing the first phase of work, which is to eliminate feudal separatist hereditary forces and complete a unified situation. The completion of this first phase of work was achieved half through the efforts of our people and the leadership of the highest leader, and half thanks to the oppression provided by Japanese imperialism in the six years from September 18th to the present. Due to the aggression of imperialism, it has exposed its hideous face and has reached the point of destroying us, thus enabling the whole country, regardless of party or class, to truly awaken and concentrate all forces to fight to the death against the imperialists who aggress against us most fiercely. We believe that with the arrival of this extraordinary period, the strength shown by the whole country will definitely exceed that of the great era of the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China. The efforts required of the people of the whole country in the second phase of the National Revolution will definitely be more arduous and greater than in the first phase. During this period, we see that Mr. Guo Moruo, who has been away from the country for a long time, has returned. Thinking of his efforts in participating in the National Revolution ten years ago and the various sad and indignant emotions in a foreign country in the ten years in between, he has now returned regardless of everything, definitely holding a great determination to do his best in the work of national salvation. At the same time, we see that Shen Junru and the other seven gentlemen have also returned to Shanghai safely, ready to continue to work with everyone on national salvation. In this kind of emotionally exciting and enthusiastic atmosphere, everyone feels that only one thing is needed in the future, that is, everyone should show their sincere unity. Originally, in such a large country, in the process of achieving unity, differences in opinions or methods, and differences in the order of priority and pace, are not surprising. As long as when a great era descends, when great suffering is added to everyone's head, everyone can put aside all prejudices and unite into a strong and solid team, and we will definitely be able to shoulder the mission of national salvation. Because the country has reached today, the nation is at a time of life and death. If we still cannot unite sincerely, it is tantamount to the suicide of the entire nation, which is the suicide of the entire country. Therefore, what we hope for and what we try our best to achieve is the united efforts of the whole country to reach the final juncture of resisting insults and saving the nation, and to strive for the second phase of the National Revolution, oppose the imperialists who are aggressing against China, and establish a new China of independence, freedom, and equality. Now everyone clearly recognizes that our country's foreign troubles are serious, and there is no second way to go other than resistance. Some people outside still doubt the choice between "peace" and "war." This is really an unnecessary doubt. Our country is not facing the problem of "peace" or "non-peace." The Chinese nation has always hoped for peace, not only hoping for peace in the Far East, but hoping for peace in the entire world. However, now we want peace, but others do not want peace. Peace must be realized on the principle of equality. How can there be peace without equality? However, we must recognize that this war of resistance is a protracted war of resistance, a war of resistance of the entire nation. Everyone must prepare to sacrifice everything in this war of resistance to contribute to the country. People in cultural circles must also make this meaning clear to every compatriot. It must be known that this war is not a child's play, not something that can be completed in a moment, and not something that can be compromised and succumbed to halfway. Chairman Chiang has clearly indicated to us in two talks that it is a war of the entire people拼生死and the entire country拼存亡, then how to deal with the inevitable war, regarding strategy, the ordinary people cannot doubt, cannot consult, and should not interfere. If the general public wants to doubt, question, or even interfere with the government's strategy, then there is no need to resist, and the result is already known. If there is not even confidence in trusting the strategy of military leaders, and debates fill the country, how can we resist? The major responsibility regarding strategic aspects can only be assumed with full authority by believing in the government. Under the current circumstances, people in cultural circles should believe in the government, prepare themselves, and when the crisis arrives, think about what work they can do, how to organize the people, and train the people, so that the people will not be at a loss when the curtain of war opens, and so that they will not have nothing to contribute to the country. I hope that everyone present, as well as Mr. Guo Moruo, Shen Hengshan, and the other eight gentlemen, will participate in this cultural circles' national salvation movement and, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, strive for the final victory of the national war of resistance.</p>
<p>Four Speeches</p>
<p>Guo Moruo stated that today, being warmly welcomed by everyone is really the first great honor in Moruo's life, and also the greatest shame. Now everyone is talking about resisting the enemy. I feel that resisting the enemy needs little talk, only action. This war of resistance is not only a military war of resistance. The cultural circles, as well as the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors, should all participate in this war of resistance. We in the cultural circles must expose the enemy's conspiracies and dark secrets. At the same time, we must concentrate all our forces to fight for the country's independence, freedom, and equality. In the past, everyone did not have the greatest determination because some people valued their lives and property too much. Valuing life too much means fearing death, and valuing property too much means loving money. Yue Wu Mu said, "If civil officials do not love money and military officers do not fear death, then the world will be at peace." I dare say that if everyone is not afraid of death and everyone does not love money, then the enemy will be defeated. Now the whole country must resist under the leadership of the highest leader and make the greatest efforts together. Then, Shen Junru spoke, stating that he is a member of the Kuomintang and hopes that the Chinese Kuomintang will earnestly lead the people and organize the people to resist under the guidance of the National Government. Then, Zhang Naiqi spoke, hoping that in the future, the people of the whole country will unite sincerely, and their spirit, will, and actions should be unified. There must be confidence in the victory of the war of resistance. Li Gongpu spoke, stating that we should not overestimate the enemy's strength too much, nor should we underestimate the enemy's strength too much. Everyone should unite sincerely, receive training and organization from the government, and deal with the enemy in unison. In addition, Hao Zi, a representative of Japanese students returning to China, reported on the recent situation in Japan and the process of being forced to return to the country. The speech was long and is omitted.</p>

<h3>Two Groups Participate in Battlefield Service</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Boy Scouts</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Group, recognizing the severity of the national crisis, wants to save the perilous situation and can only rise up one after another to resist the enemy together. It has organized a battlefield service group, divided into several sections such as rescue and poison prevention. Training has now begun and is actively underway. The internal participants are all members of the group, and the regulations are quite strict. Also, the group held its seventh member swearing-in ceremony at 8:30 AM yesterday in the auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce. Present were Boy Scout Director Zeng Zhao Weizu, Ye Chunnian of the City Chamber of Commerce, and all members of the group, totaling more than one hundred people. The ceremony, presided over by Head Xu Guozhi and led by Li Yating, was simple and solemn. First, the chairman gave an opening speech, followed by an instructive speech from the superior representative, urging everyone to unite in this extraordinary period, bury themselves in hard work, take responsibility, observe discipline, listen to orders, and take a photo to commemorate the occasion. It was also learned that the group gathered at the administrative department at 4:00 AM yesterday. More than two hundred people from the active army, reserve army, and various organizations held an inter-row inspection. They departed from the City Chamber of Commerce, passed through North Suzhou Road and the Bund, turned to Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road, and then returned to the group via Avenue Foch and Beijing Road, lasting about two hours. Their spirits were high and their steps were orderly. The inspection was conducted by the head and deputy head, and Chief Commander Wang Yingqi said.</p>
<p>Anhui Compatriots</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 8th), Anhui compatriots in Shanghai held a joint meeting at No. 6, Lane 142, Tongfu Road. Representatives from the Anhui Compatriots Association in Shanghai, the Huining Compatriots Association in Shanghai, the Fulin Compatriots Association, the Yingzhou Seven Counties Compatriots Association, the Shexian Compatriots Association, the Jixi Compatriots Association, the Nanling Compatriots Association, the Shoufeng Tongxiang Public Welfare Association, the Xingjiang Dunzitang, and the Hexian Compatriots Association, totaling dozens of people, were present. Xu Bolong was publicly elected as chairman, and he reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, they discussed: ㊀ That Anhui compatriots in this city should organize wartime service groups for the purpose of national salvation through resistance, given the urgency of the national crisis. It was resolved that all Anhui compatriot groups in Shanghai should organize a wartime service committee, which was established on the spot. Uninformed groups were notified to nominate one to three representatives to participate in the organization within just three or four days. ㊁ The organizational outline was passed. All attending representatives served as members of the committee and appointed Xu Bolong, Lü Yin'nan, Sun Zaoqing, Wu Qilun, Cao Zhigong, and others as the general affairs group; Wang Yucheng and Cheng Ziyun as the fundraising group; Zhang Yizhai and Li Ming as the rescue group; Wang Zhurue and Li Xiangxian as the reconnaissance group; and Cheng Kefan and others as the relief group to actively carry out the work. ㊂ The method for raising funds for the committee was discussed and it was resolved: ㊀ Funds would be raised separately by groups and individuals. The groups would proceed separately by each compatriot association and follow the principles of wartime service guidelines. ㊁ For individuals, the fundraising group would formulate fundraising methods, which would be implemented after being passed. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Returns to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Staying in Nanjing to Liaise with the Authorities at Any Time</p>

<h3>National Salvation Rally Held on the Asia Queen</h3>
<p>Hosted by Our Students and Overseas Chinese in Japan and the United States; American Women Also Happy to Help Raise National Salvation Donations</p>
<p>Two hundred and eighty-three Chinese students in Japan, more than twenty students in the United States, and more than forty overseas Chinese compatriots arrived in their motherland on the Asia Queen ship at noon on the 7th. It is learned that all the compatriots held a national salvation rally on the ship on the evening of the 6th. More than two hundred ship employees and workers also enthusiastically participated. When national salvation donations were solicited, an American woman happily donated one U.S. dollar to show her sympathy. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Situation of the National Salvation Rally</p>
<p>The Asia Queen Ship Chinese Students and Overseas Chinese in Japan and the United States National Salvation Provisional Assembly's written statement is as follows: Just as the motherland's peaceful unification was completed and the great cause of construction and national rejuvenation was underway, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. This incident not only proved that the enemy would not allow us to peacefully build a modern country, but also proved that this was a planned new offensive by the enemy to attempt to destroy the entire China. At the same time, we saw the motherland's active war preparation, which further proved the firm will of the central government, Chairman Chiang, and the entire people to resist the enemy. We, the returning overseas Chinese workers and students on the Asia Queen ship, want to show that our return to the country is not out of greed for life and fear of death, wanting to retire to our homeland. Our return is entirely for the motherland. We will enthusiastically participate in the actual work of national salvation at the front or in the rear, and vow to be the government's backing in resisting the enemy. Therefore, we feel it is necessary to first hold a national salvation rally of overseas Chinese and students in the United States and Japan on the ship. At the same time, overseas Chinese in the United States and ship workers have launched a fundraising campaign since the ship left the United States. Later, the returning students in Japan who boarded the ship further believed that a joint national salvation rally should be held. Thus, at 10:00 PM on August 6, the enthusiastic and sublime national salvation rally began in the first-class dining room of the Asia Queen ship. We hung up the Party and National flag and the Premier's portrait. The venue, decorated by the workers, became our world. In the auditorium, which was filled with the anti-Japanese sentiment of our compatriots, our Party anthem soared. Although the sea storms were great, many compatriots overcame seasickness and enthusiastically participated. The number of people was no less than three hundred. The spirit of the compatriots caring for the motherland is truly admirable. From this rally, we can believe that the final victory will definitely belong to us. At the venue, overseas Chinese, workers, and students all had very sincere, genuine, and enthusiastic reports and speeches. Finally, it was decided to conduct a fundraising campaign and send all the donations to the central government as funds for the war of resistance, to express the sincere patriotism of all compatriots in supporting the government's war of resistance. Under the tense atmosphere and enthusiastic air, our National Salvation Provisional Assembly adjourned. We hope that our compatriots in the country will give us more guidance so that we can all participate in the actual work of national salvation and save the endangered motherland, and move towards the road of an independent, free, and happy new China. The Provisional Assembly Presidium's representatives were Xu Chuanjing, representing students in the United States; Luo Yi and Hao Yuanyou, representing students in Japan; Xiao Buyun, representing overseas Chinese in North and South America; and Huang Yunfeng, representing workers on the Asia Queen ship.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe Answers Questions from Our Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>Willing to Strive to Resolve the Crisis Through Diplomacy; Continued to Summon Military Attachés from the Army and Navy Yesterday</p>
<p>According to New Voice News Agency, Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe Shigeru gave the following answers yesterday to the written questions raised by the Chinese reporters' group the day before: Question: What are Your Excellency's views on breaking the Sino-Japanese deadlock with this visit? Regarding the resolution of the situation in North China, will diplomatic negotiations begin soon? What are Your Excellency's opinions? Answer: The current situation is extremely serious, and the objective situation is gradually trending towards a crisis. I am in the diplomatic profession and am willing to strive to resolve it through diplomatic means. Question: Are the attitudes taken by Your Excellency's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military consistent? Answer: This strange question does not need to be answered. There is no reason for the organs of the same country to have differences of opinion. Question: Is the ambassador about to go to Nanjing? Answer: The date of going to Nanjing has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Since arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, Kawagoe, in addition to summoning diplomatic personnel such as the Consul General in Shanghai, Okamoto, for talks that evening, yesterday at 11:00 AM, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, Kita, the naval attaché, Honda, the commander of the Third Fleet in China, Hasegawa, and others, continued to visit him at his residence on Bixun Road. Kawagoe recounted his trip north and listened to the opinions of Kita and others. They dispersed at noon. Reports that the Consul General in Nanjing, Hidaka, came to Shanghai the night before to meet with Kawagoe were not true. Hidaka did not come to Shanghai. According to the Ta Kung Pao, Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe Shigeru, at about 10:30 AM yesterday, in order to comprehensively study countermeasures based on reports from all parties, convened all the key foreign army and navy personnel stationed in Shanghai, such as Kita, Kusumoto, Okamoto, and Tajiri, to hold an informal meeting at his private residence to thoroughly discuss everything. At the same time, Commander Hasegawa of the Third Fleet and Commander Okawauchi of the Marine Corps also participated. It is also learned that Kawagoe, after telegraphed the results of the meeting to the Ministry of Finance in his country yesterday for instructions, will gradually implement them. Therefore, whether Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations will resume within days and whether there will be special developments in the general situation in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places will be completely clear within the next day or two.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals Retreating from Hankou Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Most Will Transfer to Ships to Leave China and Return Home; Consulate Personnel Temporarily Stay in Hankou Awaiting Orders</p>
<p>The Japanese nationals and naval landing forces in the Japanese concession in Hankou suddenly received instructions from their government to withdraw. The factories and stores set up by Japanese nationals in the area began to close down from the 7th and notified the local authorities to provide protection. According to news from the Japanese embassy, it is estimated that more than a thousand Japanese nationals who withdrew from Hankou on the 7th, half men and half women, were transported by two ships of the Japan-China Steamship Company, Jinyang Maru and Fengyang Maru, escorted by the Hirase and Tadasu gunboats stationed in Hankou, and are scheduled to arrive here today. Except for those who wish to stay in Shanghai, the rest will transfer to ships to return home. As for the naval landing forces, they left Hankou on the 8th on the Kuri, Hozu, and Yae ships to come to Shanghai. However, the Acting Consul-General in Hankou, Matsudaira, and the personnel from the consulates gathered in Hankou from various ports upstream of the Yangtze River, as well as the police from the Japanese consulate, totaling more than a hundred people, will temporarily remain in Hankou, awaiting instructions from Tokyo before withdrawing.</p>

<h3>North China Coal Company Does Not Sell Coal to Japanese Warships</h3>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident, our people have warned each other not to sell items that could be used to aid the enemy. Recently, some people have claimed that the North China Company supplies large amounts of coal to Japanese warships. According to the coal industry, the seller of the coal is not the North China Company, and the buyer is not directly purchased by the Japanese warships. It is transferred by Mitsubishi Corporation. It is also learned that since its establishment, the North China Company has specialized in selling domestic coal and has always adhered to its aim of not buying or selling goods of an enemy nation. It is purely patriotic and has always strictly adhered to the responsibilities of citizens. When it sees greedy people in the same industry, it always makes righteous dissuasion. The company has now prepared its business records over the years and plans to issue an advertisement tomorrow to declare in various newspapers and ask various legal groups to conduct a fair and thorough investigation to clarify the truth.</p>

<h3>Engraving Shop Owner Reports Forgery of Customs Seal</h3>
<p>Intended to Defraud Customs Brokers of Tax Exemptions; Vigilant Shop Owner Reports, One Arrested</p>
<p>Chen Youjun from Tianjin, recently arrived in Shanghai from his hometown and stayed at the residence of a friend at No. 27, Alley 23, Xizang Road. Unable to find a business, he conceived a wild idea. On the 4th of this month, in collusion with Li Gemin, who is currently at large, he forged the seal of the Jianghai Customs, intending to defraud customs brokers of money. With this seal, tax could be avoided. After discussing it, the two believed it was a very appropriate plan. Li Gemin wrote the draft of the customs seal, and the next day at 7:00 PM, Chen Youjun went to the Bu Jingui engraving shop at No. 182, North Henan Road. He asked about the price, offering $2.60, and said that it would be best to bring the engraving tools and wood to his friend Li Gemin's house on Avenue Joffre for the engraving. Bu Jingui suspected that Chen Youjun's actions were undoubtedly for the purpose of forging the Jianghai Customs seal to defraud people of tax exemptions. He refused to go, acting evasively. He told Chen to leave the two draft paper strips of the seal in the shop for engraving, and to pay a deposit of $2. Chen said that he would contact his friend (i.e., Li Gemin). Suddenly he left. The next day, he went with Li to talk to Bu Jingui again, but Chen remained silent. Sometimes he spoke to Li, and both spoke in English. Seeing their behavior, Bu Jingui arranged for Chen to pick up the seal at the shop the day before yesterday, secretly reporting it. The Hongkou police station sent a detective to notify Liang Huajie, an official of the Jianghai Customs from Guangdong, to wait at the entrance of Bu Jingui's engraving shop. Chen Youjun arrived shortly afterward and was arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer Li Zhiyue explained the case and requested a postponement. The two paper strips were presented for inspection. Subsequently, Jianghai Customs official Liang Huajie and engraving shop owner Bu Jingui testified about the process. When questioned, the defendant confessed. Judge Zhong ruled to remand him in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Safe from Cholera This Summer</h3>
<p>Continued Attention to Hygiene Necessary</p>
<p>According to an announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, no cholera has occurred in this city since the beginning of summer. This is largely due to the widespread preventive vaccinations and strict management of food and beverage establishments. The public's understanding of summer hygiene knowledge and refusal to consume harmful foods are also major reasons for the disappearance of the disease. Based on the current situation, it is predicted that this summer can be safely passed. However, we must not be complacent. In addition to actively paying attention to food hygiene to prevent this infectious disease, we must also abide by all hygiene principles to achieve the overall health of our bodies and minds.</p>
<h3>Fatal Accident While Scrambling to Board Ningbo Steamer</h3>
<p>Hired Boat Rushed Ahead Before Ship Docked; Furious Waves Capsize Boat</p>
<p>Many Ningbo people residing in Shanghai have recently returned to their hometowns due to the current situation, resulting in Ningbo steamers operating day and night, but passengers are still extremely crowded. At 10:00 PM on the 6th, the Xin Ningshao steamer of the Ningshao Company returned to Shanghai from Ningbo.</p>
<p>While the ship was docking at the company's wharf, Ningbo carpenter Wang Shuchun, Yuan Jinsheng, and an unidentified man, along with Ningbo porters Lu Guisheng and Yang Xiangzhang, hired boat No. 591 to take them to the outer side of the ship. Yang Xiangzhang used a rope hook to secure the boat. Wang and the other two men intended to be the first to board the ship in order to get better berths, while the two porters intended to board the ship to solicit business for carrying luggage. At this moment, the waves in the harbor were raging. The boat tilted and suddenly capsized. All six fell into the water. Nearby rowing teams gathered and rescued four passengers and boaters, but an unknown male passenger and porter Lu Guisheng drowned. The bodies sank and their whereabouts are unknown. Afterward, the Water Patrol Corps investigated and found that boater Hu Zhenwei and porter Yang Xiangzhang were suspected of causing death by negligence, and took them into custody for investigation.</p>
