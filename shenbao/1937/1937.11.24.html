<h3>九國公約會議討論二次宣言我代表發表沉痛演說</h3>
<p>希望各國勿忘共同努力維護條約　宣言書復鄭重聲明各項和解原則</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　九國公約會議席間、中國首席代表顧維鈞發出緊急呼籲、請求援助中國、井對於概述過去三星期討論經過之報告書草案、加以强烈之批評、顧稱該報告書僅重申普遍之原則、并保留提出相當修正案之權、蓋各國於第一次宣言中所主張採取之共同態度、現巳實毫無動作、至彼所呼籲增强中國抗戰力量之各種具體辦法、現在更一字不提也、該報告書現已由英美兩國代表團擬就、內容大致係屬消極性質、其中歷史部份聞曾提及九國公約及凱洛格公約等、但並無如國聯决議案中援助中國之任何行動或單獨援助之主張、再則、該報告書規定會議暫停開會、俾各國得從容交換意見、並尋求和平解决之方法、惟會議之停開、並不作各國對於遠東事件不復注意之解釋、最後該報告書復規定會議可由主席或任何會員重新召集之、昨日之會議、對於該報告書、經深長之討論後、卽宣告休會、至星期三、俾中國代表團得有向本國政府請示、大約星期三日將有二次集會、始能宣告閉幕、中國首席代表顧維鈞日昨發表演說時、聲稱、目前遠東之衝突、很明顯的為一國對於其餘各國破壞條約之行為、因此會議之任務、亦至明顯、卽考慮在此種狀態下、各國應採取之共同態度是也、中國代表團並深知宣言無補於事實、若無積極之行動、不論直接或間接、則一切宜言及决議、無論其精神如何誠懇、均不能發生實效、在過去兩年以來、世界之事變所已曉示者、卽各國雖有在國際關係中維持法律治安之志願、但均躊躇或拒絕對於一致行動之作積極之贊助、其結果則非但未能阻止、反巳助長促成暴行與紊亂、顧氏復對於中國在過去四年中對於和平解决努力之經過、有所陳述、並稱、中國之資源極屬有限、故其努力之結果、亦必相當菲簿、但可向各國宣示者、卽中國將繼續竭力奮鬥、非但盡其九國公約及凱洛格非戰公約簽字國家之義務、並將盡其為國際間愛好和平國家之天職、至其他各國、除一國之外、俱已宣告遠東之戰爭、在法律方面與九國公約及凱洛格公約參與諸國均有關係、並在事實上、與國際間一切國家莫不有關係也、至此、顧氏卽謂、“以君等國家無限之資源及力量、豈君等尚不能採取一種積極之行動、卽使係屬間接者、對於維持法律治安以及世界之安全及和平盡其一份子之力量乎、豈君等尚信原則之簡單實言及諾言誠信之最高昭告、卽屬已足乎、君等之拒絕援助中國、豈君等欲中國停止抵抗或以為中國能不藉相當之實力、卽可永此抗戰者乎”、顧復稱、意志之團結、必須隨之以動作之團結、中國深信彼有權可以要求九國公約各簽字國家共同努力、非但使條約受尊重、并為公理治安及世界和平着想云、最後顧氏聲明保留提出修正案之權、俾得向本國政府請求具體之訓令云、（中央社二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　九國公約會議、本日午後五時舉行全體會議、當將英美法三國代表所會同提出之二次宣言書草案、提付討論、其內容主張無定期延會、但過必要時由國或兩國提出要求加以召集、中國首席代表顧維鈞首先發表沉痛演脫、謂此項宣言書草案、對於第一次宣言書最後一段所規定之共同態度、旣無隻字加以道及、而其內容、僅將若干種一般的原則、重言以申明之、殊屬令人觖望、九國公約會議如此怱愈結果、而毫無收穫、徒使“一般的不安情感、為之增加而巳”云、顧氏演說旣畢、其他各國代表并無一人繼之發言、會議旋於七時十五分决定於二十四日午後三時賡續開會、討論宣言書草案與報告書草案、届時中國顧維鈞將依據該國政府之訓令、對於各該項草案提出修正案、一般人以為九國公約會議、當於二十四日宣布無定期延會、在實際上殆以確定無疑、（中央社二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　昨日九國公約會議席間、中國首席代表顧維鈞所發表之演說、各國代表雖曾專心傾聽、但恐難發生效力、法代表曾指顧氏而言日、“此人之言、雖無可加以爭辯、但吾人實無能為力也、”至此次報告書之內容、現尚諱莫如深、所發出之份數極有限、且均編號、該報告書計分二部、第一部為歷史部份、第二部為大會宣言、歷史部份日昨下午巳經討論、在原則上通過、內容為會議召集以前一切事件之直錄、並以各代表意見答復及前次之宣言作為附錄、第二部共分十三章、鄭重宣言國際工具為担保安全及和平骨幹、并聲明中國之軍事行動完全出於自衛、凡一國以强制手段加諸他一國之解决辦法、决不能遣成公正永久之和平、而任何解决不必考慮及各種有關係之權益、該宣言復指斥直接交涉之主張、并堅持戰事之應從速中止云、（中央社二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　九國公約會議、昨日舉行全體會議時僅有一點堪予重視、卽中國首席代表顧維鈞所發表之演說、對於會議討論三星期之久、並未獲有何項滿意結果一層、曾提出嚴重抗議是也、會議旋卽將英美法三國代表所會同提出之報告書與宣言書草案、提付討論、報告書內容共分十一段、係將會議經過情形、加以紀述、而成為宣言書之序言、其大要已在原則上通過、最初八段乃係追述會議召集情形暨其成就、第九段涉及將來、尚未通過、其大意乃謂九國公約會議因與日本意見懸殊、無從賡續工作、第十段申述九國公約會議十一月七日送致日本政府照會、第十一段申述會議十一月十五日所發表之第一次宣言書、至日本政府所發出之復文、則當列入附件、此外、宣言書草案、則因中國代表顧維鈞聲明、擬提出修正案之故、未便遽爾加以分析、會議於明日討論此項修正案之後、卽當宣告無定期延會、此後仍可由主席或由兩會員國要求召集、卽會議所担負之任務、亦不因而解除、特中國若果要求將此案移送國聯會審理、自當予以照辦、此在墨西哥代表法白拉、因不甚滿意會議工作情形之故、已主張移付國聯會處理、至英法兩國代表、則當與美國代表圑採取同一態度、美國首席代表台維斯一俟會議延會之後、卽當首途返國云、（中央社二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>我代表積極奮鬥仍望各國接濟軍火</h3>
<p>英下院討論援助我國問題　意國接濟說謂係出於誤會</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　美聯社今日得確息、中國代表顧維鈞現正希望獲得九國公約會議某某數國秘密軍火接濟、中國代表對會議採取延宕政策、卽在掩飾此種談判、星期三顧氏對會議二次宣言、或將提出修正案、要求各國以軍火及借款接濟中國、並對日實行制裁、亦未可知、惟悉中國並不希望成功、僅望利用此種外交壓力、使英美法俄保證接濟軍火云、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］工黨議員漢德森今日曾在下院中提出援助中國之問題、漢氏向外相文登詢問、英政府曾否依照國聯十月六日之决議、考慮單獨援助中國、是否曾就援助範圍通知美國、並聲明在此範圍之內、美國可獲得英國之完全合作、艾登對此問題表示抱歉、謂對於問題前部、幾每日有所决定、惟無法供給詳細報告、復謂、各關係國尋求之目標、卽欲以同意制止中日戰事、此亦卽現尚未散會之九國公約會議之工作基礎云、關於問題之後一部、艾登稱、此屬單獨行動之事件、因此英國雖極願對於一切遠東局勢、與美國維持密切接觸、但此事無需與他國合作云、漢德森再問、英政府是否有與美國同樣程度、援助中國之準備、艾登稱彼在答復之前、希望提出書面問題云、（中央社二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］新聞記事報今日載稱、日本在英所享之金融便利、將逐漸感受限制、此非政府授意、但為銀行謹愼計耳、日本在倫敦之銀行信用、在最近數月中、達數百萬鎊、目下祗達一百萬鎊、日本在倫敦貿易金流通額約達四百萬鎊、日本在倫敦信用在五百萬鎊與六百萬鎊之間、其投資額則為二百萬鎊、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］中國前實業部長陳公博在此間勾留一週現巳啟程前赴此京、在此間曾接見新聞記者稱、中國此後將接受意大利軍火接濟云、此言頗引起此間人士之驚異、意大利權威當局宣稱、陳氏之言、想係某種誤解而起云、（二十三日海通電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］參院中立派議員奈氏等今日已鞏固陣線、擬使羅斯福總統實施中立法、奈氏以為本屆國會必能有所舉動、因九國公約會議徒令美國難堪、美國當知此等會議、决無成就矣、美國參加上次戰爭、卽因與他國之商務關係、現在美國延不實施中立法、亦因對日貿易、中途梗阻云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>日本對我宣戰問題</h3>
<p>政府軍部　慎重研究</p>
<p>東京　末次大將昨日對近衛首相建議對華强硬方針、惹起各方面注目、中國旣然維持長期抗日戰爭、故關於收拾或解决戰局之方法、正式宣戰問題、尚待考慮、今後政府軍部與內閣參議之間、似以愼重態度研究此問題、（二十三日同盟電）</p>
<p>東京　政府與內閣參議之懇談曾二十二日下午在首相官邸開會、政府方面近衛首相與全體閣員均出席、參議方面除松岡·榔·兩人未出席外、其餘各參議全都到席、最先由陸海兩相報告最近戰况、其次廣田外相說明關於九國會議及中國事變之外交情形、後由各人交換種種意見、至四時許散會、（二十三日同盟電）</p>
<h3>英下議院討論上海租界問題</h3>
<p>議員質間頗露鋒芒　艾登外相答語審愼</p>
<p>［倫敦］下院今日對於上海公共租界局勢有種種質問、足見國會議員、對於上海時局之深切注意、工黨彭恩首先發問、請外相艾登聲明、公共租界之行政根據、苟不得中國政府之同意、不得稍加變更、艾登答稱、租界行政以洋涇浜地皮章程為根據、此項章程未經中國政府同意、不能變更云、彭恩又問、政府是否謂上海日總領事所提出之要求、莫可接受、艾登答曰、是為另一問題、余之答語、措詞審愼、可賅括此問題云、彭恩復問、此語是否作上海工部局不致為日軍傀儡以施行其政策之解、艾登答稱、此乃重要問題、請書面提出、俾便答覆、保守黨諾克斯繼起發問、㊀外相知否日軍在上海附近最近戰事中、曾盡力保全公共租界內之外人商業與居住區域㊁外相可否向日政府接洽、以期為中國難民謀取安全、俾可重理舊業、艾登答稱、目前時機尚早、未便對於第一問中所提出之點、作最後之判决、至於第二問、則英政府是否有此種發動之需要、現尚未悉、此乃公共租界工部局當局所可為之一事渠恐難民在實際上現尚莫能重理其舊業云、工黨佛萊轍問、外相曾否接到日政府方面消息、表示日政府欲接收中國政府在公共租界與法租界中所行使之職權、艾登請佛萊轍提出書面問題、以便考慮答復、（中央社二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］艾登外相嗣談及英國駐華大使許閣森被擊傷案、謂日本方面並未賠償損害、蓋以“英國政府經縝密考慮之後、以為由政府自行賠償較為適宜、故未向日本要求賠償、”至於外傳英國駐華海軍司令李德爾中將曾向上海日軍司令松井大將祝賀勝利一說、并非確詞、共產黨議員加拉轍嗣又質問、上海虹橋路英橋住宅被劫掠事、外相答稱、英國駐華官員正竭盡所能、保護本國僑民之財產、倘有損害情事、一俟調查屬實、卽當要求關係方面加以賠償、”要之、關於中日兩國爭端、凡與遠東時局有關各國、刻正覓取最佳方法、以冀成立恊定加以解决、九國公約會議之召集、卽以此項原則為基礎、此項會議、目前尚在開會中、此外、英仍與美國保持密切聯絡云、（中央社二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國態度</h3>
<p>［華盛頓］今日據此間消息、日人假若攫取中國在上海方面之各種行政權力與機關、美國必提出嚴重抗議、此間所恐懼老、卽日人之行動、有危及租界條約權利之可能、國務院現正對日人在上海租界之活動、作密切之研究與注視、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>日欲攫取海關郵局</h3>
<p>原田興岡本　訪租界當局</p>
<p>［東京］日駐滬陸軍武官原田二十日訪問公共租界當局、又岡木總領事亦訪問董事長法郎克林、關於日方接收海關與郵政局問題、有所談判、日方關於此問題、抱持如次見解、而認為當然司能接收兩機關、即數年前宋子文辭財政部長、海關總稅務司梅樂和對宋氏贈頌德表、以留紀念、當時宋氏演說略謂、中國海關曾為特殊存在、然今日在形式及實質兩方面完全成為中國政府之一行政機關、因此、總稅務司亦不過中國之一官吏而已云云、由此觀之、海關之國際性已經完全消滅、現在日本接收海關、其性質與日軍佔領或接收中國其他機關同一、國際方面應無任何反對意見、因此可以解釋日本有權扣留海關船舶、中國海關從來為中國國家之特別存在、然照九國條約某一條關於保全中國行政之根木原則觀之、旣不准有如此性質者頗為明顯、至於郵政局、亦以同樣之理由、可解釋日本得實行接收、日方今次特派原田武官與岡本總領事向公共租界當局交涉、蓋欲在和平空氣中解决問題也、（二十三日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日本牧田抵法</h3>
<p>巴黎　關於中日兩國爭端日本派來法國之親善使節牧田頃於本日晚間八時十五分自紐約行抵此間、日本大使館館員多人、均在車站歡迎、（中央社二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>國聯醫藥隊定期來華</h3>
<p>下月十日啟程</p>
<p>［日內瓦］國聯會大會前於上日間决定以二百萬瑞士法郎組織流動醫藥隊三隊前往中國、恊助該國進行防疫事業之後、此項醫藥隊業已組成、其中第一隊由北非洲法屬都尼斯城“巴斯德”微菌學院拉斯耐博士興賴格萊博士率領、定於十二月十日首途赴華、其他兩隊、行期現尚未定、（中央社二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>波拒絕參加反共恊定</h3>
<p>不願脫離英國</p>
<p>［倫敦］茲據孟劫斯德指導報華爾沙記者報告、波蘭雖受德意日三國之强力壓迫、但至今尚拒絕參加反共公約、該記者復稱、波蘭深恐加入反共公約後、將妨及波英關係、蓋與英維持聯擊、無論在政治上或經濟上、均屬波蘭外交政策之重要部份云、（中央社二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>九國公約訂立的經過</h3>
<p>— 昻若</p>
<p>九國公約係於一九二二年二月六日簽盯成立，此種文件正式稱之為“關於中國之原則與政策……條約”，普通稱之為九國公約·一九二一年，美國總統哈定召開華盛頓會議，九國公約就應運而生。當時會議的主要目的係裁减海軍，結果會由美·英·日·法·意·五國訂立了海軍限制條約，但是和議中幾位重要代表却承認，九國公約的成立，乃係太平洋各國締造和平的初步工作，因為中國問題解决之後，各國就釜底抽薪，除去了紛爭的焦點，用兵的威脅旣隨之消釋，海軍限制條約因之就立定了基礎，遠東大局似乎可以長治久安了。</p>
<p>九國公約係由美·比·英·法·意·日·荷·葡·暨中國所簽訂，當時曾被人稱之為“中國大憲章”。它的精義就此第一條，戰稱，除中國外締約各國恊定：</p>
<p>㊀尊重中國之主權與獨立，暨領土與行政之完整。</p>
<p>㊁給予中國完全無碍之機會，以發展並維持一有力鞏固之政府。</p>
<p>㊂施用各國之權勢，以期切實設立並維持各國在中國全境之商務實業機會均等之原則。</p>
<p>㊃不得因中國狀况乘機營謀特別權利而减少友邦之權利，並不得獎許有害友邦安全之舉動。</p>
<p>其他條文祇把這些一般的原則加以引申，如在戰時尊重中國的中立地位之類。此項條約若被違犯，約文上祇有一條明白說明締約各國應取的步驟，就是第七條規定：</p>
<p>締約各國協定無論何時遇有某種情形發生，締約國中之任何一國，認為牽涉本條約規定之適用問題，而該項適用官付諸討論者，有關係之締約各國，應完全坦白互相通知。</p>
<p>所以，就條文的措辭而論，締約各國所可採取的唯一積極辦法就是在任何締約國認為適宜的時候，應當互相通知，這層意義，覆按當時的會議錄，也無所增益。荷蘭外交部長加納貝克曾亦會議席上提出問題：一中國主權或行政的完整將來若被某一國威脅，締約各國應採取何種立場？”這個問題也被擱置，公約起草委員會的議事錄或大會席上各國代表的演說，都未續加提及。不過在美國代表路德宣讀公條第一條時，曾加說明云，這是“宣布一種法治的規則，俾由締約各國知所遵循；並不包含積極行動的意思，也不容許一國干涉他國，或指定各國應採取何種行動。”美國已故國務部長許士是會議的主腦人物，也是美國首席代表，他對於這種精神更有明確的解釋，當會議討論公約第一條第三第四款關於開放門戶政策時，有人主張設立參考部，担任調查此項政策有無被違犯的情事，許士曾宣稱；“本條並無强迫性質，任伺强迫辦法亦屬無補於事，最後唯有依靠宣布這些原則的各國政府恪守信義，予以履行而已。</p>
<p>按之正式紀錄，這就是公約訂立的精神，美國參議院全體一致予以核准，恐怕也是以這種精神與諒解為根據。九國公約於一九二二年三月三十日提付美國參議院討論時，參議員歇巴特曾質問：“假使締約國之一未能履行公約第一條所規定尊重中國的主權與獨立，其他締約國應採取何種辦法？”參議員恩陀胡特（曾擔任美國代表）答稱：條約中並未載明用兵的義務。締約九國之一不能要求他國用兵，不過條文中却規定一種道德的義務，使違反條約之一國，在世界各國面前，成為一個“違法者”。更進一步，這個違反條約不尊重中國權利的一國，對於其他八國，將處於極嚴重的境地。我不能設這種義務不會引起用兵。任何事情都可以引起用兵。不過本條文並未載明用兵的義務而已”。</p>
<p>參議員歇巴特對於這個解釋仍不滿意，恩陀胡特就續加申說云，美國曾採取一種步驟使山東歸還中國，各國或當採取同樣步驟亦未可知。歇巴特又問。“貴議員之意，是否即謂各國僅以抗議為止乎？”恩陀胡特答曰，然，但復加以申說曰：一某種抗議，措辭懇切有力，或者會發生實效”，並且相信“道德的義務，也有偉大的權威興力量的”。假使抗議無效，那末這事就須提付國會討論了。</p>
<p>參議員歇巴特再就第一條第二款加以辯論稱，在萬一之際，道德的義務或須牽涉到用兵，“否則條約就亳無價值可言了。”恩陀胡特答稱，“我想這個條約在道德上沒有牽涉到用兵的義務，更沒有用兵的意思。我不是說，將來有一天，美國政府不會由美國講會表示决心，對遠反條約的一國說，“你得罷手，”並且準備强制執行這個命令。但是這層在條約上並無明文規文。”</p>
<p>關於九国公約所規定美國對於中國的義務，參議院就接受了恩陀胡特所下的定義。參議員金格當時也發表意見說，這個條約是一種“友誼的宣言—一種偉大的國際表示，如此而已。”參議院波拉加以贊同說，“我想各國倘使時常能够表示這種善良的决議，最後必然能够有助於剷除惡劣的行為罷。”</p>

<h3>列山隨筆</h3>
<p>— 馮列山</p>
<p>事實同報紙上的記載</p>
<p>德國女人的煩惱</p>
<p>初來德國的人，對於德國婦女的不事裝飾，沒有塗脂擦粉這一套習慣，都感到驚異。尤其在街道上所看到的女性大半總雄糾糾地具有男子風，認爲是一宗無法了解的事情，爲什麽德國的女性單獨有這個例外？一個女人有不愛修飾的天性，說起來好像是一宗奇跡！</p>
<p>其實，在這種地方，德國女性也有她們的苦衷。德國男子的一般“輿論”——最少在表面上，不但擁護“健康美”，甚至於進一步主張“自然美”的。普通一位濃裝艷服的少女，很不容易得到大多數靑年男子的同情。當她在街道上走時，背後總有人故意大聲批評給她聽：“瞧呀—這裏有一個法國女人”！第二次她還敢再度嘗試？德國男子眼中的美人標凖是女運動員。雖然，許多德國靑年心理却羨慕英法等國的女性。到過巴黎，倫敦的德國男子回來以後總會吿訴大家，英法兩國的女人得眞好看。</p>
<p>自從國社黨登台以後，德國的少女都被編入希特勒女靑年團。她們穿上了軍服般的棕色服裝。每星期要操練幾次。當她們集隊在街上游行的時候，步伍整齊，幾乎要比英國的陸軍還神氣得多。有一次，當一隊希特勒女靑年走過後，一位德國靑年吿訴記者，他想，他還是不結婚來得好些。一年以前我們幾乎到處可以看到這種穿“軍裝”女團員踪跡。去年起情形突然改變過來，許多少女都愛穿平時的裝束了。據英國一家報紙的意見，這純粹出於德國男子消極抵制的結果。</p>
<p>最近幾年來，運動在歐洲民間十分流行。冬天到高山上去滑雪，夏天赴海濱游泳，只要有這種經濟能力幷時間，誰願意把這個機會錯過！這批人在山上或海濱受了兩三星期的太陽光，晒得通身渾黑。等到他們回來以後，皮膚上黑的程度雖不及眞正的黑人，但比起印度人來已有過無不及。這種黑皮膚漸漸變成了時髦，一面可以表示他或她作過旅行，另一面也成爲健康的象徵。許多婦女更把她們的“黑面孔”當做裝飾品，傲然在街道上行走。這種風氣一開，便引起其他城市婦女的傲傚。然而大部分女性是沒有金錢幷時間到山上或海濱去的。於是她們便想出另外一個方法，不是在屋頂或公園中晒太陽，便利用太陽燈把她們的臉部晒得通黑。這尤其是愛好運動的德國婦女，認爲這是她們唯一的裝飾品。結果德國各城市中。黑皮膚的婦女幾乎到處都可以看到。因之引起了國社黨當局的不安。</p>
<p>國社黨的種族論是竭力提倡純粹的阿里安種的。擄說“北方阿里安種人的特色，就是皮膚白而頭髮金黃。對於頭髮金黃這一點，德國人已不及瑞典挪威等國人，雖然他們擁有白色的皮膚却是一種毫無疑問的事實。對於年來德國歸女運這白皮膚都不想保存，豈不是根本有意跟國社黨的種族論開玩笑！恰爲了這緣故，新近國社黨總部特地下了一個命令，痛斥這批不知愛護種族的婦女，説是她們把“劣色”的黑人皮膚當作時髦，有辱及阿里安種的德國人。在這個命令中更勸吿德國人民起來反對這批黑人皮膚的德國婦女。原來“第三帝國”的人民，不但要保存“北方”人種的本質，就是外貌上也不該使“北方”人種丟臉。此外幷通吿這種掃除“黑皮膚”運動卽日由希特勒靑年開始。</p>
<p>做德國的女人的確也不容易！</p>
<p>月前在倫敦訪問了某政治家一次，他是一個十分豪爽的人。對於記者所提出的幾個問題，都詳細加以解答。正因爲他同時又是一位專家，所以這種材料特別有價值。但監别的時候，他却再三吩咐記者，這種談話發表不得。他說：“這種事情你是應該知道的。不過發表出去，却不很妥當的了。於是乎我們也只好割愛。</p>
<p>記得兩年前在德國時曾參觀過齊伯林飛艇廠一次。那時候數月前遭難的興登堡號正在製造之中。在沒有參觀以前，記者從德報上收集了不少材料，凖備寫篇通訊。據德報的記載，該號飛艇的製造，特別困難。理由，在技術上面，每一個釘，一條綫，都要經過十分細心的配置，不容有絲毫的差誤。所以要到什麽時候全部工程才能够完畢，誰都不敢預言，也許還要半年時間或者一年時間……</p>
<p>在參觀時，凑巧碰到一位熟人，他也是該廠工程師之一。承他領導參觀，記者就將這個疑問請他解釋。同時先吿訴他，德報的記載說是單爲了技術上的困難所以要多費時日，這一點，我們做新聞記者的人是不會相信的。因爲製造飛艇德國歷來就有豐富的經驗！</p>
<p>於是乎他就把眞相說出來。據他說，當在歐戰期間，德國製造飛艇的能力曾每一個月完成一雙齊伯林飛艇。照目前的技術設備來說，每半個月一隻飛艇也並非難事。此次所以屢吿延期的原因，還是經濟的綠故，他低聲說：你想想看，每日來這里參觀的人起碼有幾百人，我們每個星期單門票一項就有幾千馬克的收入。此外這個地方酒館旅店業的繁榮現象，也靠着我們這雙飛艇。以技術來論，在幾天以內我們可以把它趕出來。但這對於我們又有什麽好處？我們的飛艇完成後，全部遊客立刻散去。……又何况目前我們已有齊伯林號飛艇在行駛……</p>
<p>臨別時，他吩咐記者∶千萬別提起他剛才所說的那一段話。記者的回答是：“自然，我怎好去吿訴讀者，齊伯林飛艇廠單爲了遊客的門票關係，延長飛艇的製造時間？至於我是否也如別的報紙一樣，說那是純粹技術的問題，還得讓我考慮一下。”</p>
<p>考慮的結果，我就犧牲了那篇通訊。</p>
<p>讀者要自己小心</p>
<p>記得去年有幾位熟人來信，希望記者多多寫些關於歐洲政治的內幕。他們覺得閱讀國內報紙的國際新聞，幾乎有愈讀愈模糊的感想。這一點，記者，個人是萬分同情的。在國內報紙沒有派專員駐外，或中央通訊社沒有擴充成一個國際性的通訊社以前，這種現象總是無法改善的。</p>
<p>國內報紙的國際新聞來源，全由各國的大通訊社供給，法國的哈瓦斯社除供給我們法國新聞以外，還要附帶着當天各國的電訊。英國的路透社，日本的同盟社，德國的海通社，蘇俄的塔斯社，美國的合衆聯合社等，無不如此。所以每遇一宗事變，各國通訊社就以自己的立塲，以本國的看法，來向我們報吿所謂這宗事變的“眞相”。德國記者眼中的法國，同法國記者眼中的德國，雖說大家寫出來不能與事實相去太遠，但在我們中國人看來，多少總要打些折扣。給果反映在中國報紙上，就變成一種矛盾的現象。每件新聞，公說公的道理，婆說婆的道理。倒霉的只有我們的讀者而已！</p>
<p>也許，有人覺得，在各國通訊社的電訊中，平常似乎找不出宣傳的痕跡。其實，這種地方，就是宣傳的藝術。宣傳到讓人家看出來，這種人只配做正式的宣傳員。各國的通訊社都是半官式的，他們感到困難的地方，就在於發稿時無論如何要裝做他們的地位是超然的，最少要使讀者相信他們不在宣傳。一到了緊要關頭，他們就輕描淡寫，好像一切都是事實，使一般讀者無法分辯，這才是宣傳的妙技。</p>
<p>目前國內報紙最大的一個弱點，大約在於國際新聞的不能獨立。把這種可寶貴的篇幅，變成了各國通訊社新聞戰爭的戰場，說來我們唯有慚愧，因爲我們花了錢去購買人家的宣傳材料。這裏除奉勸讀者閱報時自己小心以外，另一面更希望各報國際新聞欄的編輯，對於當天各社的電訊，加以整理。最少應該提起，某國通訊社的看法如此，某國通訊社的看法如彼，讓讀者自己去判斷。</p>
<p>我們暫時所能够做到的；大約只有這一點。</p>

<h3>被困租界之警隊迫切請求發餉</h3>
<p>雖已通吿發放但尚未收到　警備聯隊部屬亦同處困境</p>
<p>自本月九日我軍奉令退出上海、我軍事最高當局飭令上海市警察局長蔡勁軍率所部警察大隊、曁公訓隊警備聯隊、恊同五十五師張彬旅部、死守南市、無如兵力微薄、械彈不足、忍痛撤退、揮淚繳械、而忠勇將士作壯烈犧牲者、為數甚夥、中隊長鍾揚身先士卒、竟以身殉、今者數千忠勇戰士、被禁租界、飢寒交迫、掙扎於生死綫上、呼救無門、負責者雖曾登報通吿發餉、但數千嗷嗷待哺之忠勇將士、尚未領到、茲將昨日所得消息錄下、</p>
<p>首次呼籲</p>
<p>警察總隊特務總隊全體官警曾於十六日呈文當局、呼籲乞援、大意云、‘竊自滬戰發生後、我警察隊奮勇抗戰、在軍工路扼守十數日、屹然未動、其後……移駐南市、……咸具與南市共存亡之决心、自九日接觸以來、雖有小失、終無大敗、孰意於十一日晚我全隊官警正在酣戰之際、忽奉全部撒退缴槍……之令、乃忍痛撤退、揮淚繳槍、……於此數日中、我全中隊作壯烈犧牲者有之、我隊長以身殉國者有之、其他官警之傷亡、尚不計其數、……乃自繳械後、竟成戰敗之士、被擄之俘、在收容所內、食不飽、睡不足、……已均淪為難民、而警等兩月餘之餉項、分文未發、……此數千警士之家小、已成等死無救之孤魂、景象之慘、不忍卒言、今蔡局長雖登報發餉、……倘此餉項無法領取、則此數千警士家小之生機、將完全斷絕矣、……警等在此迫不得已之際、乃敢縷陳下情、懇請援手警等希求者、㊀請局內派高級長官前來慰問、㊁請設法恢復警等之自由、㊂請設妥善之辦法發放餉項…’云云、</p>
<p>再請發放</p>
<p>自上述呈文發表後、迄已多日、對該警士之三項要求、至今尚未批答、而日前市警察局又登載啟事、謂餉項業由各分局所隊長領發云云、聞該警士等至今尚未收到、惟發餉日期、限明日（廿五日）截止、該警士等恐慌萬分、但以法租界當局監禁甚嚴、决不輕易放走、更無法領取餉銀、該警士等乃向法租界當局再三懇切要求、法租界當局乃命該警士等將所有儲蓄金及餉銀開一詳細淸單、代為交涉領取、但尚未辦到、該數千警士、益增惶恐、乃於昨日又呈蔡局長文云、“上海市警察局長蔡勁軍鈞鑒、頃閱本局啟事云、餉項已由各分局隊長領發、然警等分文未見、此筆餉項、究為何人領取請查明發放、警等在此備册待領、駐金神父路法政學院警察總隊特務隊啟、十一月廿二日、”深望負責者體䘏部下捨身為國犧牲之哀忱、予以援助、</p>
<p>同樣苦楚</p>
<p>又本市公民訓練隊所組織之警備聯隊、亦以死守南市之故、漂流無依、上海市社會軍事訓練警備隊總部、雖屢次通吿發給薪餉、津貼䘏金以示矜䘏、但以該隊各中大隊長均星散避匿不見、且無地址、無從找尋、今該隊乏衣無食、飢寒交襲、生者露宿街頭、傷者呻吟巷角、悲切萬分、查該隊警員雖未為國殉難、而報國之心、亦未見後人、切望當局謀妥善辦法、發給薪餉津貼䘏金以維後生、</p>

<p>鎮海封鎖綫由要塞引導　甬同鄉會接洽通航辦法　恰和等照常駛滬通綫</p>
<p>意商華義公司之德平輪已於昨日午後三時、自外灘金利源碼頭啟椗赴甬以後可望賡開行、各情如次、</p>
<p>德平離滬駛甬</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>九國公約會議的尾聲</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>舉世矚目的九國公約會議現在陷入了可歎的僵局。第一次宣言中所主張的共同態度。各國代表在二十二日的全體會議仍然毫不加以討論。我國顧代表在會塲上發出了緊急的呼籲。也得不到別國代表的響應。就表面看來。這個會議似乎已經撞了喪鐘了。</p>
<p>其實。九國公約會議對於實際有效的共同行動。不會有任何的决定。這是在開始召集時就可以意料的。因為要澈底解决遠東的危機。這次會議所根據的九國公約。在性質上遠不及國聯盟約的適用。如果我們要使中日問題獲得順利的解决。本來只有運用國聯的機構才會有希望。而九國公約會議的原來目的是調解。在調解不可能時。發表一通空洞的宣言。也就算得完成任務了。</p>
<p>然而宣言儘管空洞。終究表現了各國的意向。這意向轉變到有效的行動實在是遲早的問題。現在各大國為了環境上的穩種困難。固然還不敢再推進一步可是任何困難總有打破的一天。因為遠東安全問題。在一切國際問題中間。有着最大的比重。這是任何大國的政治家必須竭盡智能來解决的。</p>
<p>我覺得目黯淡的局勢中間還浮現着熹微的光明。</p>

<h3>Nine-Power Treaty Conference Discusses Second Declaration; Our Representative Delivers a Solemn Speech</h3>
<p>Hoping All Nations Will Not Forget Joint Efforts to Uphold the Treaty; The Declaration Reaffirms Various Principles of Reconciliation</p>
<p>Brussels - During the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the chief Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, issued an urgent appeal for assistance to China and strongly criticized the draft report summarizing the discussions of the past three weeks. Gu stated that the report only reiterates general principles and reserves the right to propose substantial amendments, as the common attitude advocated by various countries in the first declaration has now completely failed to materialize. Furthermore, the various concrete measures he appealed for to strengthen China's resistance are not even mentioned. The report, drafted by the British and American delegations, is generally passive in nature. The historical part reportedly mentions the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but without any action or individual assistance to China as in the League of Nations resolutions. Moreover, the report stipulates that the conference will be adjourned to allow countries to exchange views and seek peaceful solutions. However, the adjournment should not be interpreted as a lack of attention to the Far Eastern events by various countries. Finally, the report stipulates that the conference can be reconvened by the chairman or any member. After lengthy discussions on the report at yesterday's meeting, it was adjourned until Wednesday, allowing the Chinese delegation to consult with its government. A second meeting is expected on Wednesday before the closing can be announced. In his speech yesterday, the chief Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, stated that the current conflict in the Far East is clearly an act of one country violating treaties with other countries. Therefore, the task of the conference is equally clear: to consider the common attitude that various countries should adopt in this situation. The Chinese delegation is also deeply aware that declarations are no substitute for action, and without active measures, whether direct or indirect, all declarations and resolutions, no matter how sincere in spirit, will have no practical effect. What the events of the past two years have shown is that although countries have the will to maintain law and order in international relations, they are hesitant or refuse to actively support concerted action. As a result, they have not only failed to prevent but have also contributed to the promotion of violence and disorder. Gu also recounted China's efforts over the past four years to resolve the situation peacefully, stating that China's resources are extremely limited, so the results of its efforts must also be correspondingly meager. However, it can be declared to all countries that China will continue to strive, not only fulfilling its obligations as a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but also fulfilling its duty as a peace-loving nation in the international community. All other countries, except one, have declared that the war in the Far East is legally related to all parties to the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and in fact, to all countries in the international community. At this point, Gu said, "With the unlimited resources and power of your countries, can you not take some active action, even if indirect, to do your part in maintaining law and order and the security and peace of the world? Do you still believe that simple statements of principles and the highest declarations of good faith are sufficient? Does your refusal to help China mean that you want China to stop resisting or that you believe China can continue to resist indefinitely without substantial strength?" Gu further stated that unity of will must be followed by unity of action. China firmly believes that it has the right to demand that all signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty work together, not only to ensure that the treaty is respected but also for the sake of justice, order, and world peace. Finally, Gu stated that he reserves the right to propose amendments in order to request specific instructions from his government. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Brussels - The Nine-Power Treaty Conference held a plenary session at 5:00 PM today, during which the draft second declaration jointly proposed by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France was submitted for discussion. Its content advocated an indefinite adjournment but allowed for the conference to be reconvened if requested by one or two countries when necessary. The chief Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, first delivered a solemn speech, stating that this draft declaration did not mention a word about the common attitude stipulated in the last paragraph of the first declaration, and its content merely reiterated some general principles, which was disappointing. The hasty and fruitless conclusion of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference only "increases the general feeling of unease." After Gu's speech, none of the other country representatives followed with speeches. The meeting then decided at 7:15 PM to continue the meeting at 3:00 PM on the 24th to discuss the draft declaration and the draft report. At that time, Gu Weijun of China will propose amendments to each of the drafts based on the instructions of the Chinese government. It is generally believed that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will announce an indefinite adjournment on the 24th, which is virtually a certainty. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Brussels - Although the representatives of various countries listened attentively to the speech delivered by the chief Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, during yesterday's Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it is feared that it will be difficult to produce results. The French representative pointed to Gu and said, "Although this person's words are irrefutable, we are really powerless." The content of this report is still kept secret, and the number of copies issued is extremely limited, and all are numbered. The report is divided into two parts: the first part is the historical part, and the second part is the general assembly declaration. The historical part was discussed yesterday afternoon and passed in principle. Its content is a direct record of all events before the convening of the conference, with the opinions and answers of the representatives and the previous declaration as appendices. The second part is divided into thirteen chapters, solemnly declaring that international instruments are the backbone of guaranteeing security and peace, and stating that China's military actions are entirely self-defense. Any solution imposed by one country on another by means of coercion can never lead to a just and lasting peace, and any solution must consider the various relevant rights and interests. The declaration also denounces the advocacy of direct negotiations and insists that the war should be ended as soon as possible. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Brussels - During yesterday's plenary session of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, there was only one point worthy of attention: the speech delivered by the chief Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, who strongly protested that the conference had been discussing for three weeks without achieving any satisfactory results. The conference then submitted the report and draft declaration jointly proposed by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France for discussion. The report is divided into eleven sections, which describe the progress of the conference and serve as a preface to the declaration. Its main points have been approved in principle. The first eight paragraphs trace the circumstances of the convening of the conference and its achievements. The ninth paragraph concerns the future and has not yet been approved. Its general idea is that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference cannot continue its work due to the difference of opinion with Japan. The tenth paragraph states the note sent by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to the Japanese government on November 7, and the eleventh paragraph states the first declaration issued by the conference on November 15. As for the Japanese government's reply, it will be included as an appendix. In addition, due to the chief Chinese representative Gu Weijun's declaration that he intends to propose amendments, it is inconvenient to analyze the draft declaration immediately. After discussing this amendment tomorrow, the conference will announce an indefinite adjournment. After that, it can still be convened by the chairman or by two member states, and the task undertaken by the conference will not be lifted as a result. In particular, if China requests that the case be transferred to the League of Nations for review, it should be granted. This is because the Mexican representative Fabella, who was not very satisfied with the work of the conference, has advocated transferring it to the League of Nations for handling. As for the British and French representatives, they will adopt the same attitude as the U.S. delegation. The chief U.S. representative, Davis, will leave for home as soon as the conference is adjourned. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Our Representative Actively Strives, Still Hoping for Assistance of Arms from Various Countries</h3>
<p>British House of Commons Discusses the Issue of Assisting China; Italian Assistance Claimed to Be a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Brussels - The Associated Press obtained reliable information today that the Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, is currently hoping to obtain secret arms assistance from certain countries at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The Chinese representative's adoption of a delaying policy at the conference is to cover up these negotiations. On Wednesday, Gu may propose amendments to the conference's second declaration, requesting countries to assist China with arms and loans, and perhaps impose sanctions on Japan. However, it is understood that China does not hope for success, but only hopes to use this diplomatic pressure to get Britain, the United States, France, and Russia to guarantee arms assistance. (National Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] - Labour MP Henderson raised the issue of assisting China in the House of Commons today. Henderson asked Foreign Secretary Eden whether the British government had considered individually assisting China in accordance with the League of Nations resolution of October 6, whether it had notified the United States of the scope of assistance, and stated that within this scope, the United States could obtain the full cooperation of Britain. Eden apologized for this issue, saying that decisions are made almost daily on the first part of the question, but it is impossible to provide a detailed report. He further stated that the goal sought by the parties concerned is to agree to stop the Sino-Japanese war, which is also the working basis of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, which has not yet adjourned. Regarding the latter part of the question, Eden said that this is a matter of individual action, so although Britain is extremely willing to maintain close contact with the United States on all Far Eastern situations, this matter does not require cooperation with other countries. Henderson further asked whether the British government was prepared to assist China to the same extent as the United States. Eden said that before replying, he hoped to submit a written question. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] - The News Chronicle reported today that the financial facilities enjoyed by Japan in Britain will gradually be restricted. This is not instructed by the government, but is a matter of banking prudence. Japan's bank credit in London has reached millions of pounds in recent months, but is now only one million pounds. Japan's trade turnover in London is about four million pounds. Japan's credit in London is between five million and six million pounds, and its investment is two million pounds. (National Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Rome] - Chen Gongbo, former Minister of Industry of China, stayed here for a week and has now departed for this capital. Here, he met with reporters and said that China will subsequently accept Italian arms assistance. This statement aroused considerable surprise among people here. The Italian authorities declared that Chen's words were likely caused by some misunderstanding. (Haitong dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Washington] - Neutralist Senators such as Nye have consolidated their ranks today, planning to make President Roosevelt implement the Neutrality Act. Nye believes that this Congress will be able to take action, because the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is only embarrassing the United States. The United States should know that such meetings will not achieve anything. The United States participated in the last war because of its business relations with other countries. Now the United States is delaying the implementation of the Neutrality Act because of its trade with Japan, which is being obstructed midway. (National Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan's Declaration of War on China</h3>
<p>Government and Military Cautiously Researching</p>
<p>Tokyo - General Sueyoshi's suggestion to Prime Minister Konoe yesterday on a tough policy towards China has attracted attention from all sides. Since China is maintaining a long-term war of resistance against Japan, the issue of formally declaring war is still under consideration in terms of how to deal with or resolve the war situation. In the future, the government, the military, and the cabinet counselors will likely study this issue with a cautious attitude. (Domei dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The informal meeting between the government and cabinet counselors was held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 22nd. On the government side, Prime Minister Konoe and all cabinet members attended. On the counselor side, all counselors attended except for Matsuoka and 榔. First, the Army and Navy ministers reported on the recent war situation. Then, Foreign Minister Hirota explained the diplomatic situation regarding the Nine-Power Conference and the China Incident. Afterwards, everyone exchanged various opinions and adjourned at around 4:00 PM. (Domei dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Shanghai Concession Issue</h3>
<p>Members' Questions Quite Pointed; Foreign Secretary Eden's Reply Cautious</p>
<p>[London] - There were various questions in the House of Commons today regarding the situation in the Shanghai International Settlement, which shows the deep attention of members of Parliament to the situation in Shanghai. Labour MP Ben asked first, asking Foreign Secretary Eden to state that the administration of the International Settlement could not be changed slightly without the consent of the Chinese government. Eden replied that the administration of the Settlement is based on the Land Regulations of Yangjingbang, and these regulations cannot be changed without the consent of the Chinese government. Ben also asked whether the government meant that the demands made by the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai were unacceptable. Eden replied, "That is another question. My answer is cautious and can cover this question." Ben then asked whether this meant that the Shanghai Municipal Council would not become a puppet of the Japanese army to implement its policies. Eden replied, "This is an important question. Please submit it in writing so that I can answer it." Conservative Party Knox followed up with questions: ㊀ Did the Foreign Secretary know that the Japanese army had tried its best to protect the foreigners' business and residential areas within the International Settlement in the recent battles near Shanghai? ㊁ Could the Foreign Secretary contact the Japanese government to seek safety for Chinese refugees so that they could resume their old businesses? Eden replied that it was too early to make a final judgment on the point raised in the first question. As for the second question, it is not yet known whether the British government needs to initiate this, as it is something that the authorities of the International Settlement can do. He feared that refugees would not be able to resume their old businesses in reality. Labour MP Fletcher asked whether the Foreign Secretary had received news from the Japanese government indicating that the Japanese government wanted to take over the functions exercised by the Chinese government in the International Settlement and the French Concession. Eden asked Fletcher to submit a written question for consideration and reply. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] - Foreign Secretary Eden later talked about the case of the British Ambassador to China, Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, being injured, saying that the Japanese side had not compensated for the damage. He said, "After careful consideration, the British government believed that it was more appropriate for the government to compensate itself, so it did not demand compensation from Japan." As for the rumor that the British naval commander in China, Vice Admiral Leiders, had congratulated the commander of the Japanese army in Shanghai, General Matsui, on his victory, it was not accurate. Communist MP Gallagher then questioned the looting of British houses on Hongqiao Road in Shanghai. The Foreign Secretary replied that British officials in China are doing their best to protect the property of their compatriots, and if there is any damage, they will demand compensation from the parties concerned as soon as the investigation is confirmed. "In short, regarding the dispute between China and Japan, all countries related to the Far Eastern situation are seeking the best way to reach an agreement to resolve it. The convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is based on this principle. This conference is currently in session. In addition, Britain is still maintaining close contact with the United States." (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>United States Attitude</h3>
<p>[Washington] - According to news here today, if the Japanese seize various administrative powers and institutions of China in Shanghai, the United States will lodge a serious protest. What is feared here is that the actions of the Japanese may endanger the treaty rights of the concessions. The State Department is now conducting close research and observation of the activities of the Japanese in the Shanghai concessions. (National Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan Wants to Seize Customs and Post Office</h3>
<p>Harada and Okamoto Visit Concession Authorities</p>
<p>[Tokyo] - Harada, the Japanese military attache in Shanghai, visited the authorities of the International Settlement on the 20th, and Consul-General Okamoto also visited the chairman, Franklin, to discuss the issue of the Japanese taking over the customs and post office. The Japanese hold the following views on this issue and believe that it is natural that they can take over the two institutions: that a few years ago, when Song Ziwen resigned as Minister of Finance, the Commissioner of Customs, Meyer, gave Song a eulogy to commemorate him. At that time, Song said in his speech that the Chinese customs had been a special existence, but today, in both form and substance, it has completely become an administrative institution of the Chinese government. Therefore, the Commissioner of Customs is also just a Chinese official. From this point of view, the international nature of the customs has been completely eliminated. Now, Japan's takeover of the customs is the same in nature as the Japanese army occupying or taking over other Chinese institutions. There should be no opposition from the international community, so it can be explained that Japan has the right to detain customs ships. Chinese customs have always been a special existence of the Chinese state, but according to a certain article of the Nine-Power Treaty regarding the fundamental principle of preserving Chinese administration, it is quite obvious that those of such nature are not allowed. As for the post office, Japan can also explain that it can implement the takeover for the same reason. The Japanese side has specially dispatched military attache Harada and Consul-General Okamoto to negotiate with the authorities of the International Settlement this time in order to solve the problem in a peaceful atmosphere.

<h3>League of Nations Medical Team Scheduled to Come to China</h3>
<p>Departing on December 10th</p>
<p>[Geneva] - After the League of Nations Assembly decided a few days ago to organize three mobile medical teams with 2 million Swiss francs to go to China to assist the country in carrying out epidemic prevention work, these medical teams have been formed. The first team, led by Dr. Rasnai and Dr. Ligrele of the "Pasteur" Institute of Microbiology in Tunis, French North Africa, is scheduled to leave for China on December 10. The departure dates for the other two teams have not yet been determined. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Poland Refuses to Participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact</h3>
<p>Unwilling to Break Away from Britain</p>
<p>[London] - According to a report by the Warsaw correspondent of the Manchester Guardian, although Poland has been under strong pressure from Germany, Italy, and Japan, it has so far refused to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. The correspondent also said that Poland is deeply afraid that joining the Anti-Comintern Pact will hinder Polish-British relations. Maintaining contact with Britain is an important part of Poland's foreign policy, both politically and economically. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 23rd)</p>

<p>The Nine-Power Treaty was signed and established on February 6, 1922. This document is formally called the "Treaty Relating to Principles and Policies Concerning China," commonly known as the Nine-Power Treaty. In 1921, U.S. President Harding convened the Washington Conference, and the Nine-Power Treaty came into being. At that time, the main purpose of the conference was to reduce naval forces. As a result, the United States, Britain, Japan, France, and Italy concluded the Naval Limitation Treaty. However, several important representatives in the peace talks acknowledged that the establishment of the Nine-Power Treaty was a preliminary step for the Pacific countries to create peace. Because after the China issue was resolved, the countries fundamentally eliminated the focus of disputes. The threat of using troops was eliminated, and the Naval Limitation Treaty was established on that basis. It seemed that the overall situation in the Far East could achieve long-term stability and peace.</p>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty was signed by the United States, Belgium, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, and China. At that time, it was called the "Magna Carta of China." Its essence is Article 1, which states that, except for China, the contracting countries agree:</p>
<p>㊀ To respect the sovereignty and independence of China, and the integrity of its territory and administration.</p>
<p>㊁ To provide China with the fullest and most unembarrassed opportunity to develop and maintain for herself an effective and stable government.</p>
<p>㊂ To use their good offices effectively to establish and maintain the principle of equal opportunity for the commerce and industry of all nations throughout the territory of China.</p>
<p>㊃ Not to take advantage of conditions in China in order to seek special rights or privileges which would abridge the rights of subjects or citizens of friendly States, and from countenancing action inimical to the security of such States.</p>
<p>Other articles only elaborate on these general principles, such as respecting China's neutral status in wartime. If this treaty is violated, there is only one article in the treaty text that clearly explains the steps the contracting countries should take, which is Article 7, which stipulates:</p>
<p>The Contracting Powers agree that, whenever there shall arise any situation which in the opinion of any one of them involves the application of the stipulations of the present Treaty and renders desirable discussion of such application, there shall be full and frank communication between the Contracting Powers concerned.</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of the wording of the treaty, the only active measure that the contracting countries can take is to notify each other whenever any contracting country deems it appropriate. Reexamining the minutes of the conference at that time does not add anything to this meaning. The Dutch Foreign Minister, Mr. Kanaarbeck, also raised a question at the conference: "If China's sovereignty or administrative integrity is threatened by a certain country in the future, what position should the contracting countries take?" This question was also shelved. The minutes of the drafting committee of the treaty or the speeches of representatives of various countries at the general assembly did not mention it further. However, when the US representative Mr. Luther read Article 1 of the treaty, he added that this was "announcing a rule of law to be followed by the contracting countries; it does not include the meaning of active action, nor does it allow one country to interfere in other countries, or specify what actions each country should take." The late US Secretary of State, Mr. Hughes, was the main figure of the conference and also the chief representative of the United States. He had a clearer explanation of this spirit. When the conference discussed Clauses 3 and 4 of Article 1 of the treaty regarding the open-door policy, some people advocated establishing a reference department to investigate whether this policy had been violated. Mr. Hughes declared; "This article is not coercive, and any coercive method is of no help. In the end, we can only rely on the governments of the countries that announced these principles to abide by their faith and implement them."</p>
<p>According to the official record, this is the spirit in which the treaty was concluded. The US Senate unanimously approved it, probably based on this spirit and understanding. When the Nine-Power Treaty was submitted to the US Senate for discussion on March 30, 1922, Senator Schapard asked: "If one of the contracting countries fails to fulfill the provisions of Article 1 of the treaty, which respects the sovereignty and independence of China, what measures should the other contracting countries take?" Senator Mr. Root (who had served as a US representative) replied: The treaty does not specify the obligation to use troops. None of the nine contracting countries can require other countries to use troops, but the treaty does stipulate a moral obligation that makes a country that violates the treaty a "lawbreaker" in front of all countries in the world. Furthermore, this country that violates the treaty and does not respect China's rights will be in an extremely serious situation for the other eight countries. I cannot imagine that this obligation will not lead to the use of troops. Anything can lead to the use of troops. However, this article does not specify the obligation to use troops."</p>
<p>Senator Mr. Schapard was still not satisfied with this explanation. Mr. Root continued to explain that the United States had taken a step to return Shandong to China, and other countries might take the same step. Mr. Schapard asked again. "Does Your Excellency mean that the countries will only protest?" Mr. Root replied, yes, but added: "A certain protest, with sincere and forceful wording, may have practical effect," and believed that "moral obligation also has great authority and strength." If the protest is invalid, then this matter must be submitted to Congress for discussion.</p>
<p>Senator Mr. Schapard then debated Clause 2 of Article 1, saying that in an emergency, moral obligations may involve the use of troops, "otherwise the treaty is worthless." Mr. Root replied, "I don't think this treaty morally involves the obligation to use troops, let alone the intention to use troops. I am not saying that one day in the future, the US government will not express its determination through the US Congress and say to a country that violates the treaty, "You must stop," and be prepared to enforce this order. But this is not expressly stipulated in the treaty."</p>
<p>Regarding the obligations of the United States to China stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty, the Senate accepted the definition given by Mr. Root. Senator Mr. King also expressed his opinion at that time, saying that this treaty is a "declaration of friendship - a great international expression, and nothing more." Senator Mr. Borah agreed, saying, "I think that if countries can often express this good resolution, they will eventually be able to help eliminate bad behavior."</p>

<h3>Our Troops Firmly Defend Jiangyin, Wuxi, and the Eastern Suburbs of Wuxing in Bloody Battles</h3>
<p>Our Right Wing Still Holds Haiyan and Xiashi　Danyang and Changzhou Suffer Extremely Heavy Losses from Bombing</p>
<p>The war situation on the Eastern Front yesterday: Japanese troops actively advanced, and there were extremely fierce battles on all fronts. The information obtained from the front is recorded as follows: ㊀ Japanese troops concentrated naval, land, and air forces in the Fushan and Changshu areas, attempting to break through our army's Jiangyin and Wuxi defense lines. Dozens of Japanese aircraft bombed Jiangyin and Danyang yesterday. Sixty to seventy Japanese warships were densely deployed east of Duanshan, constantly bombarding the Duanshan and Huangshan defense areas of Jiangyin with intensive artillery fire, attempting to destroy our Jiangyin blockade line. Our fortress also frequently retaliated with heavy artillery. The Japanese troops who continued to invade west from Xitang Town in Fushan were intercepted by our army in the Changshashan, Zhouzhuang Town, and Yangjiaqiao areas, more than ten kilometers east of Jiangyin. This area is a hilly area, which is easy to defend and difficult to attack, so the Jiangyin fort is still in the hands of our army, but the situation is very critical. ㊁ Wuxi is still firmly defended by our army. In the Dongting Town and Zhoujingxiang areas in the eastern suburbs of the city, our army's interception was effective. The fighting was fierce all day, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. Our reinforcements from the capital have already arrived to participate in the battle. Wuxi and nearby villages have been bombed by large numbers of Japanese aircraft in batches for days. Although most of the civilian houses and local buildings have been destroyed, this is an important stronghold on the first line of defense, and our army will never easily give it up. We are currently working hard to resist. ㊂ After our right-wing troops abandoned Nanxun, the Japanese troops invaded west along the Hujia Highway in Dongqian, Gucun, and Jicun. In order to defend Wuxing, our army has sent a large army to intercept them. The battle is raging in the Jiuguan area (3 kilometers from Jicun) and the Shengshe area (2 kilometers from Jiuguan), 18 kilometers east of Wuxing. A certain hometown group in this city's Huzhou received a telegram from a certain important person in Zhejiang Province yesterday, proving that Huzhou is still in our hands. ㊃ The Japanese troops are fiercely attacking Xiashi, Tongxiang, and Haiyan. The fighting is very fierce, and both sides have suffered heavy casualties. Our army has deployed heavy troops on the Shimen, Chongde, and Changan lines to support them. ㊄ The Japanese troops who have penetrated along the Huhang Line are having difficulty transporting supplies due to the rainy weather and muddy roads. They are currently using a large number of aircraft to transport food from the air to the Suxi area for supply.</p>
<h3>Puyuan Has Become Scorched Earth, but Our Army Still Resists and Defends Bitterly</h3>
<p>There Are Fierce Battles on Three Sides of Taihu Lake　Japan's Attempt to Land in Haiyan Was Foiled</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] The Japanese army bombarded our Puyuan and Tongxiang positions with fierce artillery fire and aircraft. Our army defended to the death until the position was bombed into scorched earth. More than a thousand Japanese troops rushed to the scene. Our brave soldiers drew their blades and rushed out of the trenches to meet the enemy. The Japanese army again relied on sharp artillery fire to bombard the area. The east of Puyuan has become scorched earth, and the forests have also been bombed into fields. Our army suffered heavy casualties, but still defended the scorched earth and resisted and defended bitterly. In the Haiyan and Xiashi positions, Japanese troops in civilian clothes sneaked into the inland rivers by speedboat to harass the area. The south bank of Taihu Lake is a land of fish, rice, silk, and satin. Some people who have lived there peacefully for thirty years have never heard gunfire. Now they are also joining the army in droves. The morale of the people is high. On the 22nd, Japanese aircraft dropped more than ten bombs in Linping in the afternoon. The losses are unknown. Two Japanese warships attempted to land in Haiyan in the evening but failed. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd) Huadong News Agency reported that, according to news received yesterday afternoon, the situation on the Eastern Front is gradually stabilizing. On the left flank, Wuxi is gradually being firmly defended. Even if Wuxi is unfortunately moved, there is a stronger defense area that can be used to maneuver. In the Jiangyin area, the Japanese army has been fiercely attacking the fortress with naval ships for days, but our naval units are still calmly handling the situation. On the right flank, from Haiyan to the Xiashi Town in Haining County, the Japanese side has adopted a completely defensive posture on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, so there has been no frontal battle on this route so far. Huadong News Agency reported that, according to news at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, there were fierce battles on three sides of Taihu Lake. The Japanese navy, starting from Nanxun in the south to Wuxing (i.e., Huzhou), and from Wujiang into the lake in the east, attempted to cross Taihu Lake and attack Yixing. In the lake area in Changxing County, there were a very small number of Japanese troops attempting to land and harass our hinterland of Huzhou. In the northern border of Wuxi, the navy entering the lake from Wangting attempted to land 40 miles north of Shushan and attack Wuxi and Qishu. Yesterday morning, many Japanese aircraft hovered in this area.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Danyang and Changzhou</h3>
<p>Several Japanese aircraft flew to Danyang twice at 11:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. on the 23rd to bomb the area and attempted to attack the capital. Our air defense department immediately issued an alarm, but the Japanese aircraft immediately fled after dropping several bombs in the suburbs of Danyang. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Zhenjiang] At 7:30 a.m. on the 22nd, two Japanese aircraft flew from Changzhou to Lingkou Railway Station in Danyang and dropped six bombs, and opened fire with machine guns to strafe the train, killing and wounding many civilians. At 9:40 a.m., more than ten Japanese aircraft flew in batches to bomb Changzhou, Danyang, Yixing, and Jintan. Dozens of bombs were dropped in Changzhou, more than ten bombs were dropped in Danyang Station, five bombs were dropped in Lingkou Station, five bombs were dropped on the Yixing Highway, and three bombs were dropped outside the West Gate of Jintan. The losses are unknown. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Order in the Huzhou Area Remains Normal</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that, after our troops in Jiaxing moved back, the war on the southern front progressed to the east of Wuxing. This city's Huzhou branch recently received a telegram from the Hangzhou office stating that the order in Huzhou (Wuxing) is normal, but most of the residents have moved away due to the war in the Jiuguan area (18 kilometers east of Wuxing). Yesterday, our army's counterattack in Jiuguan was fairly successful, and reinforcements continued to arrive. The defenses are gradually solid and can be guaranteed to be worry-free.</p>

<h3>Yu Youren Discusses Supervision Work Amidst National Crisis</h3>
<p>Stating that preventing corruption is equivalent to defending against the enemy; supervision must be meticulous and effective.</p>
<p>[Changsha] Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, arrived in Hunan yesterday. Mr. Yu recently told a reporter from the Central News Agency that when he (Yu refers to himself) passed through Jiangxi, he made a speech that roughly explained that the government's relocation to Chongqing was to adapt to strategy and to solidify the determination to resist for the long term. This would ensure that every bit of strength and every drop of blood of our nation would be dedicated to fighting for the defense of our territory and sovereignty, and to sacrificing for freedom and independence, so that the Chinese nation could become sacred and inviolable in the world. I dare to solemnly declare once again that since the government's relocation, the situation of the war of resistance has entered its largest scale. We should possess an even more tenacious and striving spirit, not only working as diligently as before, but also working ten or a hundred times harder than before to be effective. For example, in supervision work, normally it would only involve impeaching officials who violate the law or neglect their duties and auditing national budgets. At this difficult time, with military advancements at the front, a sound political rear is especially important to demonstrate the great strength of the Chinese nation in resisting the enemy and to rectify international perceptions. Preventing corruption at this time is equivalent to defending against the enemy, so we must conduct more meticulous and effective supervision. Political mobilization should not deviate from the norm, and mass mobilization should not affect social order. Based on this idea, I have sent supervisory committee members to various places to conduct open and covert investigations, provide assistance to wounded soldiers and refugees, and oversee political infrastructure and other work. This is to ensure that those who work hard are rewarded, those who make mistakes are given guidance, and those who break the law cannot escape punishment. This is the most crucial thing, and we should continue to work hard on it in the future. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the whole nation, from top to bottom, will strictly abide by national laws and wartime discipline, prepare for long-term resistance, gather individual abilities, endure short-term suffering, and strive for the freedom of the nation for thousands of years. No matter what sacrifices are required, we should not hesitate.</p>

Since the 21st, over ten Japanese transport ships have arrived, carrying many rafts, and they are making even more aggressive attempts on the Liuhai sandbar in Changshu. Due to rampant rumors on the north bank, the local military and police are on high alert, and all ports along the river and coast, large and small, are blockaded. Shipping between Nantong and Shanghai is only open at the Tianshenggang West Wharf.</p>
<p>Further Report: Refugees from the Jiangnan war zone have been fleeing to Nantong in increasing numbers over the past half-month, bringing the old and the young, in a very pathetic state. The young and strong have already gone to reclamation areas to start farming, and there are still 7,000 to 8,000 people who need to be transferred to the Lixiahe area. The Public Organization Committee is requisitioning a large number of boats to transport them in succession. Since the weather in Nantong suddenly turned cold on the 21st, with hail in the afternoon and especially low temperatures, various charitable organizations are raising cotton clothes from all over to help the refugees.</p>
<h3>World Trade Greatly Affected After the Outbreak of Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>[Geneva] According to the monthly statistics released by the League of Nations, the world economic recovery has been hindered by the Sino-Japanese conflict and the fall in world prices. The volume of international trade in September and October of this year has been greatly reduced compared to normal times, with China and Japan being the most affected. For example, China's import trade was worth 25 million gold yuan in July of this year, but it decreased to 9.6 million gold yuan in August, and further decreased to 6 million gold yuan in September and October. Export trade was worth 15 million gold yuan in July, but decreased to 7.8 million gold yuan in August. Although it was 8 million gold yuan in September, it decreased to 5 million gold yuan in October. In addition, Japan's (including Korea and Taiwan) import trade was worth 60.5 million gold yuan in July, but decreased to 51 million gold yuan in August, 44 million gold yuan in September, and further decreased to 41 million gold yuan in October. However, the impact on the country's export trade was relatively minor. (Central News Agency, Havas, 23rd)</p>

<h3>British King Convenes Privy Council Meeting to Review Report of Lord Privy Seal</h3>
<p>Halifax Returns from Visit to Germany; Report Submitted is Extremely Confidential</p>
<p>[London] King George VI convened a Privy Council meeting this morning to hear the report of Lord Privy Seal Halifax after his visit to Berlin. (Central News Agency, Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] Well-informed sources recently stated that, regarding the continued talks between Britain and Germany, German leader Hitler proposed to British Lord Privy Seal Halifax the condition of recognizing Germany's equal rights on the colonial issue, so that Germany could restore its old colonies within a reasonable period of time. In addition, the report submitted by Lord Halifax after his talks with the German authorities this time is extremely confidential and is only distributed to ministers of the cabinet departments. Even the confidential secretaries of the departments have not been able to read it, which is quite noteworthy. (Central News Agency, Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] Lord Privy Seal Halifax returned here from Berlin at 3:42 PM today and immediately had a long talk with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden, reporting on his meeting with German leader Hitler. According to what is generally known, Hitler presented Lord Halifax with a list of questions verbally, asking Britain to clarify its attitude, namely: (1) Britain should acknowledge that Germany was not the initiator of the European war; (2) Britain should acknowledge that Germany has the right to restore its former colonies without any compensation; (3) Britain should acknowledge that Germany has the right to independently resolve the issue of German minorities in various countries. It is said that Lord Halifax neither gave an answer at the time nor expressed any opinion, saying that he would forward it to his government. After the long talks between the Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary, and Lord Halifax today, the report submitted by the Lord has been sent to experts in the Foreign Office for study, and they will continue to discuss it tomorrow so that opinions can be presented at the cabinet meeting on the 24th. The public attaches great importance to the cabinet meeting on this day, believing that at that time, a decision should be made on whether to continue talks between Britain and Germany and whether to answer the list of questions prepared by Lord Halifax. It is expected that the cabinet meeting will address certain issues, or present affirmative answers. Regarding the issue of the merger between Germany and Austria, Germany may advocate holding a plebiscite in Austria to make a decision. This is a matter on which the opinions of British cabinet members are very divided, and it will inevitably cause great difficulties. (Central News Agency, Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Feetham's Expression After the Japanese Make Demands on the Shanghai Concessions</h3>
<p>Hoping that Chinese and the Municipal Council Will Cooperate to Gradually Settle the Chaotic Situation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Feetham, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, told a representative of the Shanghai Times yesterday afternoon (22nd) that the Council was not surprised by the attitude expressed by the Japanese authorities on Saturday regarding the actions of certain groups and individuals in the Public Concession and the French Concession. The Council has discussed some of the matters and feels that some changes will have to be made soon. However, in order to promptly remove the many difficulties at present, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive plan and obtain the cooperation and support of the Chinese in the concession. The city is now in an extremely unusual position, surrounded by troops on all sides and actually occupied by Japanese troops. People from all walks of life must recognize this situation. However, no friction has occurred with the Japanese authorities so far. The Council deeply believes that if Chinese with proper thinking can provide full cooperation, no friction will occur. Those who are prepared to engage in their normal business within the limits of the current situation need not be alarmed. If residents in the concession, especially the Chinese, can provide support in this regard, Shanghai can easily return to normal as soon as possible. Feetham also mentioned the discussion with the Japanese authorities on Saturday, saying that the time for discussion was limited and there was not enough time to study certain aspects of the current situation in detail. However, the Council has considered the points mentioned by the Japanese authorities, and some have already been implemented. The Council authorities had already been engaged in suppressing radical anti-Japanese groups before the outbreak of the war. This work is still in progress. However, since the situation in this port changed and the Japanese army won, most, if not all, of these groups have automatically ceased their activities. Regarding the closure of the Kuomintang branch in this port, most of the personnel of the branch have now stopped working. Feetham went on to describe the attitude of the Chinese under the current situation, saying that he had discussed the future with many influential Chinese in society. They all have vision and are prepared to endure grievances in order to avoid causing disputes. Many Chinese agree that the only solution to the current problem is to cooperate with the Municipal Council so that the chaotic situation can be gradually settled. Feetham concluded by saying that the Council is well aware of the difficulties north of Suzhou Creek but believes that the Japanese authorities are also eager to open up the areas north of the creek as soon as possible so that former residents can return.</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that Feetham, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated today (22nd) that the Council does not regard the five requests put forward by the Japanese to suppress anti-Japanese activities and eliminate the influence of the Chinese government in the Shanghai area as unreasonable. The Council authorities had already implemented most of them before the Japanese made them. There is no need to issue special orders to the Public Concession Police Force to satisfy the wishes of the Japanese. Two of the requests involve prohibiting the censorship of newspapers, news, and telegrams by the Chinese government. This censorship office has already ceased operations on its own. Another request stated that the organs and representatives of the Chinese government should be removed. This has nothing to do with the Public Concession because, with the exception of postal and telecommunications, they are all located in the French Concession. The Japanese have not interfered with the postal and telecommunications bureaus and do not intend to set up censorship offices. Feetham also said that the Council has not ordered any Chinese to leave the Concession within a time limit, and the Japanese authorities have not submitted a list of Chinese they want to expel from Shanghai. Feetham also denied the statement that the Japanese authorities had said that the Council had handed over some Chinese to the Japanese, so there was no question of refusing the request. The Council is now conducting everything with the Japanese authorities in a very harmonious manner. Feetham concluded by saying that the French Concession authorities will bear the main responsibility for implementing the Japanese requests. The French Concession authorities are still holding important meetings this morning and have not yet agreed on a solution. However, according to reliable sources, the French authorities have not asked any Chinese to leave the country. The Japanese have not set a deadline for the French authorities to implement their requests. The French authorities are still debating the best way to comply with the Japanese requests. The question of whether those who are asked to leave the country will be given safe conduct has not yet been raised, but it is expected that the Japanese will not interfere with them. Feetham commented on the Japanese request to expel certain Chinese from the Concession, saying that the Council has no right to order Chinese to leave the Concession, but can only ask them to leave. If they do not comply, they will no longer be protected by the Concession Police Force.</p>
<p>It is reported that the French police have searched several private Chinese radio stations in the French Concession and ordered them to shut down, but the details are not yet known.</p>
<h3>Philippine President Quezon Suffers from Acute Appendicitis</h3>
<p>Surgery Performed Successfully</p>
<p>⊙Manila: Philippine President Quezon suffered from acute appendicitis and underwent surgery this morning. The surgery was successful. According to doctors, Quezon's condition would have been incurable if it had been delayed for a few hours. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States are Unaware of Japan's Shipbuilding Plans</h3>
<p>All That is Known is that Naval Expenditures are Very Large, and Defensive Works are Being Built in Taiwan</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the launching of Japan's new cruisers, the naval expert of the Daily Telegraph, Pevalat, commented that the British and American naval departments are unaware of the extent of Japanese shipbuilding in 1926. All that is known is that Japan is currently spending £55 million to build new ships, £5 million to operate naval bases, and £4.25 million for naval expenditures outside of the regular budget. As for the tonnage and caliber of the new ships, it is mysteriously unknown. If it exceeds the limits of the 1936 London Treaty, the United States will definitely cancel the treaty. Japan is also building large-scale defensive works in Taiwan. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Talk in Hankou</h3>
<p>[Hankou] Chairman Wang arrived in Hankou at 11:00 AM on the 23rd aboard the Zhongshan warship, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming. A Central News Agency reporter called on Chairman Wang in the afternoon to ask for his views on the current situation. The Chairman first said that the main significance of the National Government's relocation to Chongqing is twofold: first, to be free from enemy threats, and second, to be able to mobilize the broadest anti-Japanese forces of the entire nation. This move is by no means abandoning the capital. We are determined to make the greatest effort and the most sustained struggle to defend the capital. We will also resolutely and strongly resist along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Nanjing-Shanghai lines, and inflict heavy blows on the enemy. Now, Chairman Lin has already started his journey to Chongqing. According to the provisions of the Party's constitution, the Central Party Headquarters must be located where the National Government is located, so the Central Party Headquarters will also be relocated to Chongqing. Other central organs may establish offices in appropriate locations due to factual necessity. The Chairman then made a statement on the diplomatic front, saying that we have always trusted international peace organizations. We believe that the various efforts of the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will ultimately benefit the Far East and world peace. Since the launch of our full-scale war of resistance, the international community has shown deep sympathy. Although the Nine-Power Conference has not yet achieved concrete results, we believe that they will not disappoint us on the point of assisting China. The issue of sanctions against aggressor countries may also be implemented sooner or later. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Actively Spy on Our Hainan</h3>
<p>Japanese Warships Continue to Increase in Tangjiawan, Zhongshan County; Plotting to Covet Macau and Build an Airfield on Land</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Japanese warships have been successively transferred south recently, and at the same time, armed fishing boats are being used to spy on the ports of Fujian and Guangdong. Several Japanese cruisers were found in Guangao Township and Yuanhao in Chaoyang County on the east coast of Guangdong Province. On the 11th, three more Japanese warships arrived in Tangjiawan, Zhongshan County. On the same day, in Humen, the Da Xing, a steamer traveling from Hong Kong to Wuzhou, was intercepted and searched by a Japanese warship on the sea off Dachan Island for about an hour before the ship entered Humen and went directly to Xijiang to Wuzhou. On the 13th, two warships from the Japanese 16th Fleet came to the sea off Dachan Island. On the 14th, they sailed to Hebao Island, one being a cruiser anchored in the port, and the other being a destroyer, moored in the northeast corner, using it as cover, to plot to spy on Qiongya. It is heard that the number of Japanese warships has increased to eight or nine. On the 15th, it was reported that the Japanese warships once shelled the coast, and our defense forces calmly fought back. The Japanese warships attempted to land but failed. There are usually many fishing boats going to sea between Qiongya and the Leizhou Peninsula, but recently, when the warships arrived, the fishing boats dared not go to sea. Japanese warships use searchlights to illuminate the shore at night to spy on our situation. The defending troops of Leiqiong are now on high alert. The Qiongya Defense Headquarters has also expanded its organization and established air defense branches in various counties of Qiongya to assist in handling air defense matters in each county. It was recently rumored that a Japanese aircraft carrier had sailed to Qiongya, but it has been verified that this is not the case. The Japanese aircraft that flew over Qiongya to spy were all seaplanes from Japanese warships docked in Qionghai. Each Japanese warship has about two or one seaplanes. Recently, Japan has installed no less than two or three hundred armed fishing boats in Taiwan, which have been sailing to the coasts of Fujian and Guangdong. A few days ago, a Japanese fishing boat was found near a port in Qiongya, transporting grain and fuel oil to supply the Japanese warships. Unexpectedly, it was blown by the wind to a sandy beach and ran aground. Japanese soldiers drowned, and hundreds of cans of fuel oil (aircraft fuel) stored on the armed fishing boat were seized by our residents.</p>
<p>No less than ten Japanese warships, large and small, have arrived recently in Tangjiawan, Zhongshan County. It is also heard that the Japanese are consulting with the Portuguese government in Macau, intending to use Macau as a supply base for Japanese warships, requesting the Macau government to allow them to purchase grain and fuel oil in Macau, and forcibly requesting the Portuguese government to designate a certain section of Macau as a Japanese land airfield. The Macau government has not yet made a statement. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese are steadily proceeding with their plot to conquer Guangdong and Guangxi. (November 16th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Ambassador to China Replaced</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Protests Remarks by Araki</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union has specially appointed Luganets-Orelski as the Ambassador to China. (TASS, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, returned to his country to report on his duties, and it has been over a month since he has returned to his post. The government has recently appointed Orelski as the Soviet Ambassador to China, succeeding Bogomolov. (Central News Agency, Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Mail's Moscow correspondent reported that the Soviet Ambassador to Japan has lodged a protest with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, objecting to the remarks made by General Araki, a member of the Japanese Military Council, to a Tokyo reporter advocating war against the Soviet Union, and said that such anti-Soviet activities, coming from a responsible official, are intolerable. The Soviet General Staff's newspaper, Red Star, warned Japan that if the Japanese army continues to attack Outer Mongolia, a Soviet ally, after winning the provinces of Inner Mongolia, the Soviet Union will not be able to remain neutral.

<h3>Random Notes from Lieshan</h3>
<p>— By Feng Lieshan</p>
<p>The Reality Compared to Newspaper Reports</p>
<p>The Worries of German Women</p>
<p>Those who have just arrived in Germany are surprised by the fact that German women do not pay attention to dressing up and do not have the habit of applying rouge and powder. Especially the women seen on the streets mostly have a masculine air, which is considered an incomprehensible thing. Why are German women the only exception? It sounds like a miracle that a woman does not love to dress up!</p>
<p>In fact, in this kind of place, German women also have their own difficulties. The general "public opinion" of German men – at least on the surface – not only supports "healthy beauty" but even further advocates "natural beauty." An ordinary girl with heavy makeup and flamboyant clothes is not easy to gain the sympathy of most young men. When she walks on the street, someone always deliberately criticizes her loudly behind her back: "Look, there's a French woman here!" Would she dare to try again a second time? The standard of beauty in the eyes of German men is a female athlete. However, many German youths secretly envy the women of England and France. German men who have been to Paris and London always tell everyone that women in England and France are really good-looking.</p>
<p>Since the Nazi Party came to power, German girls have been incorporated into the Hitler Youth League for girls. They put on military-like brown uniforms. They have to drill several times a week. When they march in the streets in formation, their steps are neat, almost more impressive than the British army. Once, after a team of Hitler Youth girls passed by, a young German man told reporters that he thought it would be better for him not to marry. A year ago, we could almost see traces of these "military uniform" female members everywhere. Since last year, the situation has suddenly changed. Many girls love to wear their usual clothes. According to a British newspaper, this is purely the result of the passive resistance of German men.</p>
<p>In recent years, sports have become very popular among the European people. In winter, they go to the mountains to ski, and in summer, they go to the seaside to swim. As long as they have the economic ability and time, who would want to miss this opportunity! This group of people spends two or three weeks in the mountains or at the seaside, tanned all over. When they come back, the degree of blackness on their skin is not as good as that of real black people, but it is more than that of Indians. This kind of dark skin has gradually become fashionable. On the one hand, it can show that he or she has traveled, and on the other hand, it has become a symbol of health. Many women even regard their "black faces" as decorations and walk proudly on the streets. Once this trend started, it aroused the admiration of women in other cities. However, most women do not have the money or time to go to the mountains or the seaside. So they thought of another method: either sunbathing on the roof or in the park, or using sun lamps to tan their faces. This is especially true for German women who love sports, who believe that this is their only decoration. As a result, in German cities, black-skinned women can be seen almost everywhere. This has caused concern among the Nazi authorities.</p>
<p>The Nazi Party's racial theory is to vigorously promote the pure Aryan race. They claim that "the characteristics of the northern Aryan race are white skin and blond hair. As for blond hair, the Germans are not as good as the people of Sweden and Norway, although they have white skin, which is an unquestionable fact. In recent years, German women do not want to preserve this white skin, isn't it simply deliberately joking with the Nazi Party's racial theory! Precisely for this reason, the Nazi Party headquarters recently issued an order, denouncing these women who do not know how to cherish their race, saying that they regard the "inferior" black skin as fashionable, which is a disgrace to the Aryan Germans. In this order, the German people are further advised to rise up against this group of black-skinned German women. It turns out that the people of the "Third Reich" must not only preserve the essence of the "Northern" race, but also should not embarrass the "Northern" race in appearance. In addition, it is announced that this movement to eliminate "black skin" will be started by the Hitler Youth from today.</p>
<p>It is indeed not easy to be a German woman!</p>
<p>A month ago, I visited a politician in London. He was a very generous person. He answered the several questions raised by the reporter in detail. Because he is also an expert, this material is particularly valuable. But when he supervised, he repeatedly told the reporter that this conversation must not be published. He said: "You should know this kind of thing. But it is not appropriate to publish it." So we had to give it up.</p>
<p>I remember when I was in Germany two years ago, I visited the Zeppelin airship factory. At that time, the Hindenburg, which had been in distress a few months ago, was being manufactured. Before the visit, the reporter collected a lot of materials from the German newspapers, ready to write a newsletter. According to the German newspapers, the manufacture of this airship was particularly difficult. The reason is that in terms of technology, every nail and every line must be carefully arranged, and no errors are allowed. Therefore, no one dares to predict when the entire project will be completed. Maybe it will take half a year or a year...</p>
<p>During the visit, I happened to meet an acquaintance, who was also one of the engineers of the factory. He led the visit, and the reporter asked him to explain this question. At the same time, I first told him that the German newspapers said that it was solely due to technical difficulties that it would take more time. We news reporters would not believe this. Because Germany has always had rich experience in manufacturing airships!</p>
<p>So he told the truth. According to him, during the European War, Germany's ability to manufacture airships was to complete a pair of Zeppelin airships every month. According to the current technical equipment, it is not difficult to build an airship every half month. The reason for the repeated postponements is still economic reasons. He said in a low voice: Think about it, at least hundreds of people come here to visit every day. We have thousands of marks of income from tickets alone every week. In addition, the prosperity of pubs and hotels in this place also depends on our pair of airships. In terms of technology, we can rush it out within a few days. But what good is this to us? After our airship is completed, all the tourists will immediately disperse. ...What's more, we already have the Zeppelin airship in operation...</p>
<p>Before leaving, he instructed the reporter: Never mention what he just said. The reporter's answer was: "Of course, how can I tell the readers that the Zeppelin airship factory is extending the manufacturing time solely for the sake of tourist tickets? As for whether I will say, like other newspapers, that it is purely a technical issue, I have to consider it."</p>
<p>As a result of the consideration, I sacrificed that newsletter.</p>
<p>Readers Should Be Careful Themselves</p>
<p>I remember last year, several acquaintances wrote letters, hoping that the reporter would write more about the inside story of European politics. They felt that reading the international news in domestic newspapers almost gave them the feeling of becoming more and more blurred. The reporter personally sympathizes with this very much. Before domestic newspapers send correspondents abroad, or the Central News Agency expands into an international news agency, this phenomenon will always be difficult to improve.</p>
<p>The sources of international news in domestic newspapers are all provided by major news agencies in various countries. The French Havas News Agency not only provides us with French news, but also includes the telegrams of various countries on that day. The British Reuters News Agency, the Japanese Domei News Agency, the German Huitong News Agency, the Soviet Russian TASS News Agency, the American United Press, etc., are all like this. Therefore, whenever an incident occurs, the news agencies of various countries report the so-called "truth" of this incident to us from their own positions and from the perspective of their own countries. The France in the eyes of German reporters is the same as the Germany in the eyes of French reporters. Although everyone writes that it cannot be too far from the facts, it is still somewhat discounted in the eyes of us Chinese. As a result, it is reflected in Chinese newspapers, and it becomes a contradictory phenomenon. Everyone says their own reasons for every piece of news. The only ones who suffer are our readers!</p>
<p>Perhaps some people feel that they usually cannot find traces of propaganda in the telegrams of news agencies in various countries. In fact, this is the art of propaganda. Those who publicize to the point of letting others see it are only qualified to be official propagandists. The news agencies of various countries are all semi-official. The difficulty they feel lies in the fact that they must pretend that their position is detached when issuing manuscripts, at least to make readers believe that they are not propagandizing. When it comes to a critical moment, they downplay it as if everything is a fact, making it impossible for ordinary readers to distinguish. This is the wonderful technique of propaganda.</p>
<p>At present, the biggest weakness of domestic newspapers is probably the inability to be independent in international news. Turning this precious space into a battlefield for the news wars of news agencies in various countries, we can only feel ashamed, because we spent money to buy other people's propaganda materials. Here, in addition to advising readers to be careful when reading newspapers, on the other hand, I hope that the editors of the international news columns of various newspapers will sort out the telegrams of various agencies on that day. At least, it should be mentioned that the view of a certain country's news agency is like this, and the view of a certain country's news agency is like that, so that readers can judge for themselves.</p>
<p>The only thing we can do for the time being is probably this.</p>

<h3>The First Batch of Foreign Rice Has Begun to Be Unloaded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Twelve Companies Including Wanchang Resumed Retail Sales Yesterday; The Rice Dealers Association Will Continue to Register the Second Batch Upon Arrival; The Price of Standard Flour Has Risen to Four Yuan, Two Jiao, and a Half Per Bag</p>
<p>The Public Concession Bureau and the South China Rice Industry Company are cooperating to explore the transportation of foreign rice to Shanghai to regulate people's food. The first batch of 25,000 bags has been loaded on the Jiaying Wheel and transported to Shanghai. After being certified by the consulates general of the United Kingdom and France in Shanghai, it was ordered by Daifu Foreign Company. The unloading began at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. The Rice Dealers Association received it and distributed it to 500 member rice companies. Twelve companies including Wanchang in the French Concession resumed business for retail sales yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Obstruction Process</p>
<p>After the British Taikoo Company Jiaying Wheel arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 21st, the cargo owner Daifu Foreign Company sent personnel to handle the unloading the day before yesterday. The Rice Dealers Association sent personnel to handle the collection of rice, so as to distribute it to the member rice companies in the two concessions for retail sales. Temporarily, the Japanese authorities sent personnel to investigate, resulting in the failure of unloading. Daifu Foreign Company submitted supporting documents, such as purchase orders, and reported to the French Consul General in Shanghai to request negotiations and expedite the release. At the same time, the British boss of the company reported to the British Consul General in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Certification and Release</p>
<p>After receiving the request from Daifu Foreign Company, the British and French consulates in Shanghai immediately notified the Japanese authorities that the rice loaded on the Jiaying Wheel was indeed the goods ordered by Daifu Foreign Company. They requested expedited release. After the Japanese authorities investigated and found that it was true, they agreed to release it. Yesterday morning, after Daifu Foreign Company received the notice of release from the British and French consulates in Shanghai, it immediately informed the South China Rice Industry Company to order the Rice Dealers Association to send personnel to collect it.</p>
<p>Start Unloading</p>
<p>Daifu Foreign Company sent staff to the Bund Pier on Erma Road at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to handle the unloading matters, and the British authorities sent a platoon of soldiers to protect the pier. Huang Ruyuan, Su Boxun, and others were sent by the Rice Dealers Association to handle the rice collection, and 40 trucks were prepared to carry the rice flag to transport the foreign rice. The Public Concession and French Concession police sent Chinese police to accompany the trucks to protect the Jiaying Wheel. The unloading began at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. Two barges were used from the pontoon in front of the Taikoo Pier to transport the rice to the Bund on Erma Road for loading on trucks. Each truck loaded 80 bags, which were distributed to various rice companies by the Rice Dealers Association.</p>
<p>Handle Retail Sales</p>
<p>By 5:10 p.m. yesterday, the Jiaying Wheel had unloaded a total of 1,000 bags of foreign rice. It was decided to continue unloading this morning. From 3:00 p.m. yesterday, twelve companies in the French Concession, including Baohe, Sentaihe, Wanchang, Yuanyuan, Sanyang, Tairunxing, Xindashen, Xinda, Xinshenghe, Wanxingshun, and Zhonghua, resumed business first for retail sales. The remaining rice companies and 300 rice companies in the Public Concession will resume business and handle retail sales after receiving the foreign rice. The method is to limit each person to purchase one yuan, at 8.5 cents per market catty.</p>
<p>Continue to Apply</p>
<p>The second and third batches of 55,000 bags of foreign rice have been loaded on British ships and are expected to arrive in Shanghai before the end of this month. The Rice Dealers Association has decided to continue to register member rice companies for rice collection after the first batch of foreign rice is distributed. The application form for rice collection by members is as follows:</p>
<p>"This company is willing to abide by all the temporary measures set by your association, collect rice for retail sales, and please review and register to allow distribution. Sincerely, Shanghai Rice Dealers Association."</p>
<p>After the association reviews and approves, pay the money to receive the bill of lading and collect the rice for retail sales.</p>
<p>New Rice Companies</p>
<p>Thirty-two new rice companies have been established in the Public Concession of this city recently, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now reported that twelve companies, including Shende, Hongjigong, Yongfu, Yuchengxiang, Yichangheji, Yongsheng, Chengtai, Yifeng, Jiuda, New Shanghai, and Senshunyuanji, are preparing to open.</p>
<p>Sufficient Flour Stock</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency learned from the flour industry yesterday that Shanghai had about 80,000 bags of wheat in stock last month, all piled up in various warehouses. The flour stock was about 300,000 bags. Flour factories such as Fuxin and Fufeng were rushing to produce flour. The rice market is now in excess of supply, so flour sales are very smooth. The wholesale price of standard flour, such as Fufeng's Car Brand and Fuxin's Ship Brand, has risen to 4 yuan and 2.5 jiao per bag yesterday. The prices of the No. 3 and No. 4 flour brands have also risen accordingly.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Announces Rules for Managing Grain</h3>
<p>Notice for Going to Wuhu to Purchase Rice</p>
<p>Rice merchants in this city are taking various measures to purchase grain from Wuhu, Anhui, and Wenzhou and Taizhou in eastern Zhejiang in order to supply people's food. However, eastern Zhejiang is originally a rice-deficient area and cannot supply a steady stream of grain. Anhui is a rice-producing province. Although the transportation of Jianglun is not without considerable danger, it is still passable. It is reported that the Anhui Provincial Government has now announced the Anhui Province Grain Entry and Exit Registration Rules in order to manage grain in extraordinary times. The full text is as follows: Article 1. The registration of grain entering and exiting Anhui Province shall be handled by the Anhui Province Grain Management Committee in accordance with the locations designated by the Provincial Government, and shall be entrusted to the Rice and Wheat Inspection Institute or the local county government to establish grain entry and exit registration offices separately. Article 2. Anyone who transports the following items of grain into and out of the province shall apply for registration in accordance with these rules: 1. Rice, 2. Wheat flour, 3. Beans, 4. Miscellaneous grains. For the items listed in the preceding paragraph, each county may increase or decrease the items as appropriate according to the actual situation, but it must be reported to the Grain Management Committee for record. Article 3.

<h3>Nanhua Grain Panic Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>Guangdong Grain Merchants Request Foreign Ships to Transport Goods; Jardine Matheson Has Sent Ships for Trial Navigation</p>
<p>Since the blockade of Humen, Guangzhou, navigation has been suspended for more than a month. Although it was later opened under restrictions, the shallow water and narrow roads made it difficult for various ships to navigate, and ships with heavier loads and deeper drafts, such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson, were still unable to enter. Recently, Shanghai has been affected by the war, and cargo transportation in various places has been blocked. Previously, bulk shipments of various grains such as raw peanuts, sesame, and beans from Shanghai to Guangzhou have all been cut off, resulting in a shortage of grains in Guangzhou and soaring prices. It is reported that Guangdong grain merchants have now requested foreign shipping companies such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson to increase the number of Guangzhou-Shanghai-North China liners to transport beans, sesame, raw peanuts, and other goods from Tianjin and Qingdao to Guangdong to regulate market prices and supply demand. At the same time, the grain merchants submitted a request to the Guangdong Pacification Commissioner's Office to open a partial blockade of Humen with reference to the example of the Hong Kong-Guangdong route, so as to facilitate the navigation of Guangdong-Shanghai-Tianjin liners and transport North China grain to Guangdong to make up for the cut-off of goods from Shanghai. The Guangdong Pacification Commissioner's Office has approved it accordingly. Jardine Matheson first sent the Liniu Wheel to test the Humen blockade line. The test result was that each ship could generally carry 500 tons of cargo and sail to Lizhou, 30 miles away from Guangdong Province. It could not sail further, so barges were stationed in Lizhou to be used for transshipping goods into the province. The first ship has been scheduled to be the Sheng Wheel and will sail first to Hong Kong, then to Shanghai, and then to Tianjin to carry grain to Guangdong. It is said that Jardine Matheson has scheduled the Guangsheng, Zesheng, Desheng, Hengsheng, and Lisheng Wheels to operate on this route. Taikoo has also sent six ships to travel between Guangdong, Shanghai, and Tianjin. From then on, the grain panic in Nanhua has been resolved. The loss of Shanghai and the cut-off of transportation are no longer a problem in practice.</p>
<h3>The Public Concession Health Department is Soliciting Blood</h3>
<p>For Children Suffering from Measles; Injecting Preventative Serum</p>
<p>Measles is now prevalent in this city, and residents must pay attention. There is no specific method to treat this disease, so the mortality rate of patients in this city, especially refugees, is quite high. However, anyone who injects serum made from human blood within the first few days after contracting this disease can prevent its onset or reduce the severity of the disease. Therefore, injecting serum is the only method available to the Public Concession Health Department to curb the spread of this disease. Its effectiveness has been proven by the medical community in various countries. Many enthusiastic citizens have volunteered to supply blood to the Public Concession Health Department, but the quantity is limited and still insufficient. The department has established offices at the Pasteur Medical Research Laboratory at No. 102, No. 29 Hankou Road (at the intersection of Henan Road), and the Public Concession Patrol Hospital at No. 445 Shanhai Pass Road to collect blood. Office hours are from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Any healthy adult can donate 200 to 300 cc of blood without any adverse effects on their constitution. 200 to 300 cc of blood is enough to save the lives of ten children. Blood from those who have recently recovered from measles is especially effective. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will be willing to respond enthusiastically.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Customs Patrol Boats Have Not Yet Yielded Results</h3>
<p>After all the customs anti-smuggling patrol boats of the Jianghai Customs were towed away by the Japanese army, Tax Commissioner Robert Ford made a request for negotiations, but there have been no results to date. Except for a portion of the towed boats near the No. 2 pontoon pier in Yangshupu, the rest have been sailed to the upper and lower reaches of the Huangpu River for military transportation. However, the Puji Wheel is the only fire boat in the Huangpu River and is very important for navigation safety. The Japanese side is afraid of causing an international backlash, so it has indicated that it can continue to be used for firefighting, but a separate department needs to be set up within the Concession Fire Brigade to manage the boat. Currently, the boat has also been towed away and is said to be near the Izumo warship.</p>
<h3>The International Friendship Society Regularly Entertains Celebrities</h3>

<p>According to Dagong News Agency, at 2:40 p.m. yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the area near the Small World in Nanshi and spread. For a time, smoke filled the sky and sparks shot in all directions. By the evening, it was still spreading.</p>
<h3>Local Gangsters in Pudong Search and Rob Travelers of Money and Belongings</h3>
<p>Although there are puppet police posts in the Laiyi Ferry area of Pudong, the ferry crossings along the Pu River from Qichang Wharf to Tangqiao are still guarded by 31 Japanese soldiers. On the pretext that the martial law has not been lifted, residents returning to Puxi are not allowed to land at the above-mentioned ferry crossings. To the east of Qichang Wharf, there are Jiajiajiao and Gaoqiao, where ferries are operated by righteous merchants to maintain transportation, so civilians can enter and exit. Currently, some people are concerned about their homes and are venturing across the river to visit. When they land, no one stops them and they walk leisurely. When they return, they are intercepted by gangsters midway and searched. If they have money on them, it is all robbed. If they beg them, they only return two or three cents to pay for the ferry fare. If they are carrying clothes or belongings, they are also stopped and confiscated.</p>
<h3>Please Issue Special Passports for Transporting Goods Through the Martial Law Zone</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has read the previous telegram from Jiuyuehao, requesting that unified methods for applying for cargo transportation passes be reviewed and finalized. The Ministry has sent a letter to the Fourth Department of the Military Affairs Commission to investigate and handle the matter, and has approved and notified all cases. The Fourth Department has replied that in order to facilitate the circulation of goods to meet the needs of various places, the Ministry has specially drafted special cargo transportation passports of the Military Affairs Commission, and the issuance methods and passport formats have been submitted to the Chairman for approval and implementation. In the future, when merchants in various places need to transport goods through the martial law zone, they can apply to the Ministry for approval and issuance of passports in accordance with the above methods. The corresponding methods and passport formats are copied and sent together for reference and notification to the subordinate agencies. The seal of the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<h3>The Huishan Telephone Branch Resumes Operations Today</h3>
<p>Telephone Service in the Eastern District of Shanghai is Now Uninterrupted</p>
<p>After the August 13th Incident, the Hongkou area of the Shanghai International Settlement was immediately occupied by the Japanese army as a base of operations. Consequently, all institutions, factories, and shops in the area were shut down, and even the police officers were evacuated. The Shanghai Telephone Company's Huishan Road branch was also temporarily closed. Telephone users in the East Broadway Road and Yangshupu areas were temporarily rerouted through the Central Main Branch, and the first digit of their telephone numbers was changed to '1'. Now that the war has moved beyond Shanghai and the local situation is gradually calming down, parts of the Shanghai districts are gradually recovering, and police officers have returned to their original posts. Therefore, the company's Huishan Road branch will resume operations today. All telephone numbers in the area will revert to their original prefix of '5' and be routed through that branch. As a result, telephone service has been uninterrupted in recent days.</p>
<h3>All Party and Government Agencies in Shanghai are Temporarily Closed</h3>
<p>Most of the Staff Have Left Shanghai</p>
<p>Since our army abandoned Shanghai due to strategic considerations, the entire city fell. The original Party and government agencies in Shanghai, such as the municipal government and its various bureaus, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Martial Law Command, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the various district branches, were ordered to close down due to the circumstances. Most of the staff of these agencies have also left Shanghai for Nanjing or Wuhan to work.</p>

Yesterday, they also reported and paid 13,344 yuan for the sixth subscription to the First Special District. The total sum of national currency is 134,010 yuan.</p>
<h3>Villagers in Western Shanghai Should Not Risk Returning Home</h3>
<p>Since the change in the war situation and the westward movement of the battle lines, most of the residents of western Shanghai have fled to Shanghai in a panic. As time has passed and winter is approaching, villagers need warm clothing. Therefore, some have been risking returning home to search for supplies. However, passage is impossible during the day, and they dare only travel via roundabout routes late at night. Night travel is very dangerous. Therefore, it is hoped that villagers in western Shanghai will not travel there again.</p>
<h3>Puci Sanatorium Establishes a Refugee Camp</h3>
<p>Refugees Desperately Need Clothing and Bedding - Deeply Hope for Donations from All Sectors</p>
<p>The Puci Sanatorium, located at Tongqiao Station on the Shanghai-Minhang Road in the county, is a mental hospital founded by missionaries from the United States, Britain, and France. Since the changes in the Shanghai war and the retreat of our army, refugees from Songjiang and other places have gathered in the Beiqiao area, numbering about four to five thousand, in a difficult situation. Fortunately, the foreign personnel in charge of the sanatorium have been enthusiastically helping, and have extensively accommodated them in the sanatorium. However, due to the inconvenient transportation and lack of prior preparation, and the large number of people, providing supplies is very difficult. Now that winter is approaching, the refugees desperately need clothing and bedding. It is deeply hoped that all charitable sectors will generously donate.</p>
<h3>The Children's Welfare Association Expands its Accommodation of Women and Children</h3>
<p>Children's Clinic Established in the Refugee Area</p>
<p>Since the China Children's Welfare Association established an office in the Nanshi refugee area, specializing in accommodating homeless children in the area, the association has been doing its best to accommodate all homeless children. However, there are still some children in the area whose parents cannot bear to leave them, but cannot support them on their own. The association plans to expand its accommodation of women and children to achieve both goals. It is also heard that the association is paying close attention to children's diseases and plans to establish a children's clinic in the area to treat them. However, the lack of cotton clothing for the children is a major cause of illness. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will donate generously to provide relief.</p>
<h3>The Buddhist Hospital Seeks Donations of Cotton Clothing</h3>
<p>The Buddhist Hospital at 764 Niuzhuang Road has treated more than 500 wounded since its founding. Although those who have recovered have been successively transferred to the interior, there are still more than 240 patients in the hospital. As the weather is getting colder, there is a great shortage of cotton quilts, cotton-padded jackets, trousers, and underwear. It is earnestly hoped that kind benefactors from all walks of life will generously donate to help them keep warm. Furthermore, donations of daily necessities such as medicine, milk, toothbrushes, and stoves are also welcomed from all sectors.</p>
<h3>The Post Office Temporarily Suspends Sending Small Parcels to Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1435 states that the resumption of accepting small parcels to Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong provinces was previously announced in Notice No. 1415. Due to transportation difficulties, the acceptance of small parcels to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is temporarily suspended from today. This is hereby announced so that all are aware. Director Zhapailin, November 12th.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Public Works Report for October</h3>
<p>Reviewing Building Plans, Conducting Sanitary Work</p>
<p>According to the report of the Director of Public Works of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in October of this year, public works in the northeast districts of the Settlement were largely suspended due to the war. Ditch works in the Western District were continued, but were suspended again at the end of the month as the battlefield shifted to western Shanghai. Regular work in the districts not affected by the war, such as collecting road garbage, removing silt from drains, and washing roads, was carried out as usual. A total of 153 buildings were under construction within the Settlement. A total of 34 construction plans were submitted for review, and 16 were approved. A total of 16 batches of buildings were valued and prepared for donation collection.</p>

<h3>The Police Force Trapped in the Settlement Urgently Requests Payment of Salaries</h3>
<p>Although a Notice has been Issued for Payment, it Has Not Been Received - The Officers and Soldiers of the Garrison Detachment are Also in the Same Predicament</p>
<p>Since our army was ordered to withdraw from Shanghai on the 9th of this month, the highest military authorities ordered Cai Jingjun, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, to lead the police detachment under his command, the public training team, and the garrison detachment to cooperate with Zhang Bin's brigade of the 55th Division to defend Nanshi to the death. However, due to the weakness of the military strength and the lack of weapons and ammunition, they painfully retreated and tearfully surrendered their weapons. Many loyal and brave soldiers made heroic sacrifices. Zhong Yang, the company commander, took the lead and died for the country. Now, thousands of loyal and brave soldiers are trapped in the Settlement, suffering from hunger and cold, struggling on the brink of life and death, and unable to seek help. Although those in charge have published notices to pay salaries, the thousands of loyal and brave soldiers who are crying out for food have not received them. The news obtained yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>First Appeal</p>
<p>The entire police officers and men of the Special Detachment of the Police Headquarters submitted a document to the authorities on the 16th, appealing for assistance. The gist of it is as follows: 'Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, our police force has fought bravely and defended the Jungong Road for more than ten days without moving. Afterwards...they moved to Nanshi...with the determination to coexist and die with Nanshi. Since the contact on the 9th, although there have been small losses, there have been no major defeats. Who would have thought that on the evening of the 11th, when our entire team of officers and men were fighting fiercely, they suddenly received the order to withdraw and surrender their weapons...so they painfully retreated and tearfully surrendered their weapons...During these few days, our entire company has made heroic sacrifices, our company commander has died for the country, and the casualties of other officers and men are countless...Since surrendering their weapons, they have become defeated soldiers and captured prisoners. In the refugee camp, they are not well-fed or well-rested...and have all become refugees. The salaries of the police for more than two months have not been paid...The families of these thousands of police officers and men have become lonely souls waiting for death without help. The scene is too tragic to bear. Although Director Cai has published notices to pay salaries...if these salaries cannot be received, the lives of these thousands of police officers and men's families will be completely cut off...In this desperate situation, the police dare to report the situation and ask for help. The police hope for the following: ㊀ Please send senior officials from the bureau to visit and comfort them. ㊁ Please find a way to restore the freedom of the police. ㊂ Please set up a proper way to pay salaries...' and so on.</p>
<p>Another Request for Payment</p>
<p>Since the above document was published, many days have passed, and the three requests of the police have not been answered to this day. The Municipal Police Bureau recently published a notice stating that the salaries have been received and distributed by the leaders of each branch and team. It is heard that the police have not received them yet. However, the deadline for payment is tomorrow (the 25th). The police are extremely panicked, but the French Concession authorities are strictly monitoring them and will not easily let them go, and there is no way to receive the salary. The police have repeatedly and earnestly requested the French Concession authorities. The French Concession authorities ordered the police to make a detailed list of all their savings and salaries and negotiate to receive them on their behalf, but it has not been done. The thousands of police officers and men are even more panicked, and yesterday they presented another document to Director Cai: “To Director Cai Jingjun of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, we have read the bureau's notice that the salaries have been received and distributed by the leaders of each branch and team. However, the police have not seen a penny. Who has received this sum of money? Please investigate and distribute it. The police are here waiting to receive it. From the Special Detachment of the Police Headquarters, Fazheng College, Jin Shenfu Road, November 22nd.” It is deeply hoped that those in charge will understand the sorrow of their subordinates who have sacrificed their lives for the country and provide assistance to them.</p>
<p>Same Suffering</p>
<p>In addition, the garrison detachment organized by the Citizen Training Corps of this city is also drifting and helpless due to defending Nanshi to the death. Although the headquarters of the Shanghai Municipal Social Military Training Garrison Corps has repeatedly announced the payment of salaries, subsidies, and consolation money to show concern, the captains of each company and battalion of the team are scattered and hidden, and there is no address to be found. Now the team lacks clothing and food, and is plagued by hunger and cold. The living are sleeping on the streets, and the wounded are moaning in the alleys, which is extremely sad. Although the policemen of the team did not die for the country, their hearts of serving the country have not been seen by later generations. It is earnestly hoped that the authorities will devise a proper way to pay salaries, subsidies, and consolation money to maintain the future lives of these soldiers.</p>
<h3>The Reopening of the Deping Steamer is Realized, Departing from Shanghai for Ningbo Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Blockade Line at Zhenhai is Guided by the Fortress - The Ningbo Compatriot Association Negotiates Navigation Methods - The Qihe and Others Continue to Operate on the Shanghai-Tongzhou Line</p>
<p>The Italian Huayi Company's Deping Steamer departed from the Jinliyuan Wharf on the Bund at 3:00 PM yesterday to Ningbo. It is hoped that it will continue to operate. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Deping Leaves Shanghai for Ningbo</p>
<p>The Deping Steamer was repeatedly detained in Shanghai from the 17th because it received a telegram from Ningbo preventing it from sailing to Ningbo. A few days ago, the Ningbo Compatriot Association in Shanghai telegraphed the responsible authorities in Ningbo to request permission. The ship departed from the Jinliyuan Wharf at 3:00 PM yesterday to Ningbo. The number of passengers was quite crowded. After the ship arrives at the blockade line outside the Zhenhai Estuary, a ship will be dispatched by the fortress to guide it into the port. It is scheduled to depart from Ningbo at noon today (the 24th) and return to Shanghai, arriving on the 25th.</p>
<p>Negotiating Navigation Methods</p>
<p>It is hoped that the ship will continue to operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo line. The detailed methods of navigation have been negotiated by Wu Yaqin, sent by the Ningbo Compatriot Association in Shanghai, who took the Deping Steamer to Ningbo yesterday. Wu also carried four official letters from the Compatriot Association to the Ningbo Defense Headquarters, Zheng County Government, Ningbo Police Bureau, and Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the authorities do their utmost to maintain the traffic on the line when it is absolutely necessary, in order to facilitate the round-trip of passengers and the delivery of mail between Shanghai and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Shenfu-Kai-Shen-Tai Line</p>
<p>According to reporters from Datong News Agency, in addition to the Shanghai-Ningbo line maintained by the Deping Steamer, the British Shenfu Steamer on the Shanghai-Taizhou line is also scheduled to depart today (the 24th), stopping at Dinghai and terminating at Taizhou. Tickets are sold and cargo is reported at the Taiji Business Company at 17 Fada Road. The ship is scheduled to depart at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Tongzhou Line Still Open</p>
<p>The foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Tongzhou line are the British Taikoo Company's Wuhu and Wuxue, the Jardine Matheson Company's Pinghe and Tonghe, and the Italian Huayi Company's Ende, totaling five ships. It is said that the traffic above Nantong has been cut off, but the above three shipping companies' ships on the Shanghai-Tongzhou line are still operating as usual, and passengers and cargo are still very crowded.</p>
<h3>American Nationals in Various Places Have Not Left Dangerous Areas</h3>
<p>The U.S. Consulate Expresses Concern</p>
<p>According to news from the U.S. Consulate, there are currently two American nationals in Zhenjiang, three in Jiangyin, about ten in Nanjing, two in Huzhou, ten in Mogan Mountain, and five in Suzhou (in a village 40 miles from Suzhou City). The U.S. Embassy had previously advised American nationals in these places to leave the dangerous areas, but they have remained in their original locations to this day. The Consulate is quite concerned.</p>
<h3>The Climate Suddenly Turns Cold, First Snow Yesterday</h3>
<p>Around 2:00 PM, Snow Fell for a Quarter of an Hour</p>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has been very cold in recent days, especially yesterday. The whole day was cloudy and gloomy, and the temperature dropped to 44 degrees Fahrenheit. Around 2:00 PM, it suddenly snowed. By 2:15 PM, snow pellets were falling, and the streets were covered with ice dots resembling pearls, making a sound as they fell to the ground. It stopped after about ten minutes. The north wind was biting, and the weather was very cold. Pedestrians on the road were all huddled up in a trembling state. This was the first cold snap since the beginning of winter.</p>
<h3>Yichang Water Level Drops Sharply</h3>
<p>The water level of the Yangtze River in Yichang, upstream, has recently dropped sharply, and the rate is even faster than before. According to a telegram received by the Jianghai Customs, it has fallen to 3.29 meters (10.8 feet), which is an unprecedented record. According to the water gauge markings there, the water level is usually around 30 feet.</p>
<h3>Compatriots from Changzhou and Wuxi in Shanghai Seek News</h3>
<p>Due to the delay in postal and telecommunications, compatriots from Changzhou in Shanghai are eager for news from home. It is heard that the association is now widely soliciting news. Those Shanghai compatriots who have come to Shanghai or have newly obtained news from their hometown are requested to come to the association at 6, Lane 102, Tongfu Road, or call 34128 and 85155 to Mr. Xu Yuanqing, so that the news can be passed on to the compatriots.</p>
<p>The Wuxi Compatriot Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Wuxi County Government and the County Chamber of Commerce Relief Association, asking them to provide news. It also appointed Wang Xishen and Wu Guanli as the director and deputy director of hometown news communication, respectively, to facilitate communication of news and share it with compatriots in Shanghai. If compatriots have any news about their hometown, they should report it to the association at Qipu Road or call 40694 at any time. Before the 29th of this month, they can inquire at 81219. Reports of special news from compatriots are especially welcomed. Furthermore, the association will move back to its original address on Qipu Road at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Refugee Population Statistics</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, as of the 22nd of this month, there were 145 refugee camps inspected by the department, accommodating a total of 87,083 refugees.</p>
<h3>Foreign Shipping Companies Gradually Plan to Restore Original Operations</h3>
<p>The Empress Liner will Resume Sailing to Shanghai Next Month - North German Cargo Ships Will Arrive at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reports that reporters from the Zi Lin Bao inquired yesterday with several major shipping companies that regularly operated between Shanghai and European ports. They learned that the companies all hope to start cargo and passenger transport as soon as possible in a limited way. Some of the ships of one or two of these companies continued to arrive in Shanghai on schedule during the war, but were docked in a safe place in Wusong. Now they will resume using berths upstream of the Huangpu River. An employee of Changxing Company claimed that he expected the Empress Liner to resume sailing to Shanghai next month, but cargo transported to Shanghai still needs to be insured for 25%, as the authorities believe that Shanghai is still at risk of air raids. Of the seven Java Mail ships that usually come to Shanghai, four will now sail to Shanghai on schedule. The first ship, the Texelstroom, which entered the Huangpu River after the outbreak of the war, will moor at the Guanghua Wharf on Wednesday and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai the next day. The first ship, the Tegilsendary, which sailed directly from Hong Kong to Shanghai after the outbreak of the war, will arrive on December 2nd. Previously, the company's ships sailing to Shanghai from Hong Kong all passed through Dalian. In addition, the North German Lloyd will have four cargo ships arriving in Shanghai at the end of this month. However, since the outbreak of the war, no fast passenger ships of the company have arrived in Shanghai, but one may arrive before the end of this month. The company hopes to restore regular sailings to Shanghai as soon as possible, but will temporarily scale back its operations. Three ships of the Blue Funnel Line and two ships of the Jardine Matheson Company will arrive in Shanghai in the middle of next month. These are the first ships of the two companies to arrive since the outbreak of the war. The ships were originally scheduled to unload cargo in Singapore, Manila, and Hong Kong, but now, due to the changed situation in Shanghai, they can be released directly to Shanghai and will moor at the Holt Wharf in Hongkou. Other ships of the two companies to Shanghai have not yet been determined, but in the near future, they will be able to operate in a reduced program. The Great American Shipping Company and the Da Lai Shipping Company have not yet decided to send ships to Shanghai, but the Shanghai branches of both companies are eagerly awaiting news from their headquarters to restore Shanghai sailings. The ships of the Italian and French companies did not arrive in Shanghai during the Shanghai war. The two companies currently have several ships idle upstream of the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Prices Slightly Rebound</h3>
<p>The Reason is that Restaurants are Closed - Therefore, Supply and Demand Can Be Balanced</p>
<p>The market price of food in Shanghai has slightly rebounded as the supply is not as scarce as in the past few days. In particular, the price of pork has fallen the most significantly. Yesterday, two catties of pork could be bought for one yuan of legal tender in the vegetable market, while only one catty and eight taels could be bought a few days ago. The market price of vegetables is four yuan per picul for cabbage and the same price for radishes. Sweet potatoes are 2.6 yuan per picul, and retail soybean sprouts are 20 copper coins per catty, all lower than in the past few days. The reason is that most of the restaurants have temporarily closed because it is not easy to buy rice. The above-mentioned food is only supplied to households, so the supply can be balanced.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Reorganization of the National Mutual Aid Association</h3>
<p>In order to adjust its affairs and to make its purpose and name consistent, the National Wartime Mutual Aid Association has been reorganized. The original name has been changed to the National Relief Mutual Aid Association. All relief affairs that are handled will continue, actively expanding the scope of services. In addition to the resignation of Liu Jingfang, the former treasurer, and the dismissal of one or two other people, most of the committee members are said to have been re-elected. Zheng Xuehai has been appointed as the honorary treasurer.</p>

At that time, all housewives who are interested in kitchen management will be welcome to participate and freely express new ideas. For example, the preparation of dishes, the layout of the dishes, and how to create surprises in cooking can be freely proposed for discussion. During the tea party, Mrs. Taylor, director of the company's Family Service Department, will also demonstrate the efficiency and economic benefits of the electric stove. According to the greatest feature of the electric stove, the high-heat, fast-heating iron plate does not change the color of the vegetables during cooking, and the nutrients and deliciousness are fully preserved. Secondly, the heat controller on the oven ensures that the cakes and pastries are evenly colored and textured. As for roasting meat, the heat is even, making it extremely crispy, tender, and delicious. All of these points cannot be achieved by other cooking methods. Therefore, the electric stove is a perfect guarantee for housewives to entertain friends and guests and prepare delicious food. It is expected that this guidance tea party will be beneficial and interesting to all attendees.</p>

<h3>The Epilogue of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The world-renowned Nine-Power Treaty Conference is now in a regrettable deadlock. The common attitude advocated in the first declaration was not discussed at all by the representatives of various countries at the plenary session on the 22nd. Representative Gu from our country issued an urgent appeal at the meeting, but did not receive a response from the representatives of other countries. On the surface, this conference seems to have tolled the death knell.</p>
<p>In fact, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will not make any decisions on practical and effective common action. This could have been foreseen at the beginning of the convocation. Because to thoroughly resolve the Far Eastern crisis, the Nine-Power Treaty on which this conference is based is far less applicable in nature than the League of Nations Covenant. If we want the Sino-Japanese issue to be resolved smoothly, there was hope only by using the League of Nations mechanism. The original purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was mediation. When mediation is impossible, issuing an empty declaration is considered to have completed its task.</p>
<p>However, although the declaration is empty, it ultimately expresses the intentions of various countries. The transition of this intention to effective action is really only a matter of time. At present, the major powers are afraid to take another step forward due to environmental difficulties, but any difficulty will always be broken one day. Because the Far Eastern security issue has the greatest weight among all international issues. This is what the politicians of any major power must do their utmost to resolve.</p>
<p>I feel that in the dark situation, there is still a glimmer of light.</p>

<h3>Charitable Organizations Relieving Stranded Refugees</h3>
<p>Food and Clothing Severely Lacking, Hoping All Sectors Will Provide Assistance</p>
<p>The weather has turned sharply cold in recent days. Stranded refugees in the International Settlement and the French Concession lack food and clothing. If they don't starve to death, they will freeze to death. Various charitable organizations are doing their best to raise food and clothing, but it is still far from enough. They hope that all sectors will do their best to provide assistance. The following is a brief summary of the relief work of various organizations:</p>
<p>Red Swastika Society to Investigate Inland Areas</p>
<p>After the outbreak of war on the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway, most of the residents of the Suzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou regions fled with our troops towards Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jinhua, and other places. Various native place associations in Shanghai are concerned about their hometowns and have been discussing investigation and relief matters for days. It is now learned that the World Red Swastika Society sent six people, including Wang Daoyuan, on the German ship "De Ping" to Ningbo yesterday afternoon, and from there to various places for investigation. Therefore, many native place associations have entrusted them with investigation, and relief matters will be carried out as the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>Fengxian Refugees to Register</p>
<p>The reception of fellow Fengxian villagers who fled to Shanghai to take refuge is now being handled by the Pudong Native Place Association. All fellow villagers seeking shelter can contact the Pudong Native Place Association office on the sixth floor at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chengdu Road from today onwards to register and avoid wandering.</p>
<p>The Western United Association Appeals for Donations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Western United Benefit Association believes that the north wind has been howling and the weather has suddenly turned cold in recent days, and the refugees in various districts have run out of supplies. Even if they do not starve to death, they will freeze to death. The miserable scene of wailing is difficult to describe in writing. In addition to trying to provide a large amount of food, the association finds it difficult to provide widespread relief due to the large number of people and the vast amount of supplies needed, even if it exhausts its own resources. Therefore, the association continues to appeal to all sectors for donations to jointly support this good cause and extend humanitarian aid. The most needed items are cotton clothing, cotton quilts, white rice, flour, bread, large cakes, steamed buns, etc. Please notify the association by telephone at 35627, and they will send someone to collect the donations. Your merit will be immeasurable. The association received the following donations yesterday: large cakes and steamed buns, totaling 2,000 from Ma Fook Kee, 7,700 from the staff of Shen Jiu Kee, 1,000 from the staff of Li Xin Accounting School, and two large sacks from the staff of the Municipal Council Police. In addition, the Feng Mansion donated nine bags of flour, Mr. Shan and others from the US-Asia Fourth Factory donated 12 yuan in national currency, and Mr. Lu donated 5 yuan. Mr. Cheng donated one yuan and Wu Yushu donated five yuan to purchase supplies.</p>
<p>Refugee Freezes to Death on Medhurst Road</p>
<p>At about 1 p.m. yesterday, a refugee (male) about 50 years old froze to death at the entrance of Rui'an Lane at the intersection of Medhurst Road and Singza Road in the International Settlement. According to residents there, the refugee had been living at the entrance of the lane since the outbreak of the August 13th war. He used to make a living pulling a rickshaw, but now he is stranded there because his employer fled to his hometown. He was from Haimen and had a wife and children. His body was collected by Pushan Villa in the evening. It is also learned that there are still many male and female refugees, old and young, in that area who have no place to live and are living in the open air, exposed to the wind and dew, and are in imminent danger. It is hoped that philanthropists will quickly go there to find ways to provide relief. Your merit will be immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Sufficient Supply of Prepared Coal in This City</h3>
<p>Enough to Meet Demand for Three Months, Very Suitable as Fuel</p>
<p>Most of the coal in this city is stored in Pudong, Nanshi, Zhabei, and other places. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai war, these areas have become war zones, and imports have suddenly decreased sharply, resulting in fuel prices soaring by more than 150%. Middle and lower-class families are quite panicked. Recently, it has been difficult to transport out even a small amount, but demand exceeds supply, and prices remain high. According to an investigation with the Shanghai Gas Company, there is still a large amount of prepared coal stored in the Shanghai Prepared Coal Company, enough to meet the city's needs for three months. It is very suitable for both hot water furnaces and household coal stoves, and its firepower is stronger than white coal, with no odor. The price has not increased much compared to before the war, making it an economically sound fuel.</p>
<h3>Old Zha Police Station Cracks Down on a Major Gang of Robbers</h3>
<p>Two Killed on the Spot, Nine Men and Women Arrested</p>
<p>Yu A'gen, the chief detective of the Old Zha Police Station, along with detectives Wang Shanqing and Min Zhaoxian, western detective Mai Kaitian, Huar, and more than 20 others, went to Rooms 207, 208, and 209 of the East Asia Hotel at 9 a.m. the other day (19th) to arrest bandits. At that time, a shootout occurred in Room 209, resulting in three bandits being shot and killed by the detectives. Western detective Huar's right little finger and left thumb were broken by bullets. It is now learned that the dead bandits were named Wang Dabaozi (37 years old) and Xiao Hubei (30 years old). The name of the other one is unknown, but he was about 34 years old, and the bullets hit his head, abdomen, and other parts. In the three rooms, seven bandits from Jiangbei were successively arrested: Sun Caigui (aka Xiao Erzi), Dai Xiaowangzi (aka Dai Guisheng), Zheng Zongtian, Zhou Jianru, Chen Xin, the woman Du Ni (named Gui Zhen), and Deng Li. Three Mauser pistols, 95 bullets, two revolvers, 13 bullets, three hand grenades, a bayonet, and clothing, ornaments, silver dollars, etc. were seized. Subsequently, in Lane 16, No. 313 on Mabille Road and in a shed on Singapore Road, two women, Chen Wang and Chen Shao (aka Wu Ma), were arrested. It was found that they had committed numerous robberies within the settlement. According to the confessions of the suspects, the cases include 1) No. 11, Lane 215, Medhurst Road, 2) No. 4, Lane 43, Jinlong Street, Da Feng Paper Company, and 3) No. 20, Lane 203, Hubei Road. In the Medhurst Road case, they even shot and injured the buttocks of a woman, Ms. So-and-so. This morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. The police lawyers Ru Bao'yi and Li Zhishan presented the case, requesting a postponement for further investigation of the case and the arrest of accomplices. After questioning by Judge Huang Risheng, the judge approved the remand of the suspects and postponed the hearing.</p>
<h3>Sanitary Facilities Resolved in the Nanshi Refugee Area</h3>
<p>Food and Clothing Still Needed, Expanded Scope for Sheltering Women and Children, Daily One-Cent Campaign Participated in Enthusiastically</p>
<p>The various relief efforts in the Nanshi refugee area, after careful planning by Father Rao and the staff of the International Relief Committee, are gradually progressing in an orderly manner, and especially in terms of sanitation, there has been a good phenomenon. According to the New Life News reporter, the streets in the area, which were previously dirty and foul, have been largely cleaned up after continuous sweeping by district. As for the refugee hospital, in addition to the one already established on Wanzhu Street, another one has now been added in Houjiabang. Both have taken in seriously ill refugees, and there are even more people seeking temporary outpatient treatment. In addition, there are also two maternity hospitals for refugee mothers, one next to Deyilou in the City God Temple and one on Anren Street. The committee has hired several obstetricians and midwives from various Catholic churches to work together. Therefore, the working conditions in the refugee area can be said to have been resolved.</p>
<p>Raising Food and Clothing</p>
<p>Currently, more than 7,000 poor households in the refugee area are relying on the International Relief Committee for sustenance. Registration is still ongoing, and the number is expected to continue to increase. In terms of supplies, light cakes, steamed buns, and "mo mo" are still being provided. However, after Father Rao's best efforts, 1,600 bags of white rice will be purchased soon. In addition, the International Relief Committee is also purchasing a large amount of rice from Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, and it is expected that once fuel such as coal and firewood can be arranged, rice meals can be provided to the refugees. In the past two days, the International Committee has sent out more than 1,500 cotton quilts and more than 5,000 cotton clothes, but the shortage is still huge, and it is hoped that all sectors will donate.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Donations</p>
<p>All sectors are concerned about the suffering of the refugees, and the donations of food and funds to the International Relief Committee are particularly enthusiastic. The committee continued to receive 1,000 yuan from Wu Nan Kee yesterday, a letter from a former consul-general stationed in Shanghai sending the remaining 6,279 yuan from a donation from overseas Chinese for refugee relief, 305 yuan and 58 cents from the Shanghai Saturday Society, 300 yuan from Madam Chen, the mother of Mr. Cheng of Ruihua Lane, Lafayette Road, 500 yuan each from Shao Bingsheng and Shao Zhixian, and 2,000 yuan in savings accumulated over the years from the four siblings Shen Lianzhi, Shen Jiuzhi, Shen Changguan, and Shen Quanguan. In addition, the committee has launched a daily one-cent campaign to help refugees. This method is easy and inexpensive, and participation from all sectors is particularly enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Donation From Profits</p>
<p>The Bo An Duo Si Electric Bulb Factory and the Greater China United Electric Bulb Distribution Office in this city, in view of the fact that the food supply for refugees is still insufficient despite the enthusiastic donations from all sectors, and that they are suffering from hunger and cold, which is painful to witness, have specially organized a joint office to reduce the price of their "Five-Use Duo Si Ruyi Bulb" for discount sales and donate the profits for relief. Although the price of raw materials is soaring, they are still selling at the original price and donating the profits for relief. This has been implemented since the 20th of this month. Yesterday, they sent staff to negotiate with the International Relief Committee to set aside 10% and submit it every five days for the relief of fellow citizens in distress.</p>
<h3>Great Panic Among People's Boats in Caojiadu</h3>
<p>More than 30 civilian boats parked on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek in Caojiadu, which were loaded with goods from the inland to Shanghai, did not have time to withdraw when our army moved west. Recently, enemy gunboats have been traveling back and forth there every day, and they have taken away the boat of the Consolidated Tax Bureau card parked on the south bank, causing panic. Yesterday, the boat owners moved all their luggage and belongings to the shore and fled.</p>
<h3>No Penalties for Stamp Tax Before Order Arrives</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, according to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's telegram of October 15, requested that inspectors be informed to waive penalties during the period before the order regarding the temporary measures for collecting stamp tax in extraordinary times arrives. The Ministry of Finance approved the telegram. The Ministry's order for the temporary measures for collecting stamp tax in extraordinary times, announced this time, should take effect from the date specified in the schedule of effective dates of laws promulgated by the National Government, in accordance with Article 1 of the Regulations on the Date of Implementation of Laws. Before this order takes effect, if there is any violation, penalties may be waived. In addition to ordering the stamp tax inspectors to comply with this, you are hereby informed.</p>
<h3>Large Amounts of Smuggled Goods Imported After Suspension of Anti-Smuggling Work</h3>
<p>All are Knitted Goods Dumped on the Market, Factories in This City Panicked</p>
<p>The Shenshi News Agency reports that after the Jianghai Customs' large and small patrol ships were all robbed, the anti-smuggling work has been completely suspended, and the import of smuggled goods cannot be stopped. According to a reporter's reliable information, a large amount of smuggled goods was imported in the first batch yesterday, unloaded at the Mitsubishi Wharf. All are knitted goods such as stockings, which will be dumped on the market at surprisingly low prices, much lower than the cost of manufacturing in Shanghai. Therefore, the knitting industry in this city has been panicked. Several knitting factories, which were originally scheduled to resume business within the day, are therefore temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council Registers and Returns Lost Vehicles</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that rickshaws and other vehicles in the Special District have been scattered in various parts of Nanshi, the French Municipal Council has specially sent political personnel to notify the Rickshaw Industry Association of the Special District, requesting them to inform all vehicle owners to bring the licenses and certificates issued by the French Municipal Council to the Da Zimmingzhong Police Station to register between 8:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. and between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. every day, and then wait to retrieve their vehicles.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Municipal Council Commends the Shanghai Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>The Chairman of the Municipal Council, F.C. Millington-Drake, sent a letter to the Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, Graham, stating that, "Now that the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has been reorganized into a peacetime establishment, I would like to take this opportunity to express my admiration to the members of all ranks on behalf of the Municipal Council. The organization of your corps has given me a good impression. The members of all ranks of your corps have executed their orders in an orderly manner and assisted the police in maintaining law and order." Commander Graham replied with a letter of thanks, stating, "I am grateful for your words."</p>
<h3>Relief for Poor Households in the Refugee Area</h3>
<p>Cloth Strips Issued Daily as Symbols, Many Die From Cold and Hunger</p>
<p>Food rice had been cut off long ago in the refugee area within the city, and there was also a group of poor households who originally lived in the refugee area within the city who had not had rice for a long time. Even flour was not sold in the area. Therefore, the International Relief Committee notified the households in the area that, after registering with the committee, each household would be issued a cloth strip symbol based on the number of people in the household after investigation. Each day, they could use the cloth strip with the number of refugees listed on it to collect supplies from the Yishengtang Pharmacy at the intersection of Fangbang Road and Anren Street, so as to eke out a living. However, in recent days, the weather has been cold, and many have died from cold and hunger. Although they are collected and placed in thin coffins, the roads are blocked and there is no place to bury them. Floating coffins are often seen on the roadside.</p>
<h3>Wang Yiting Donates Funds to Help Refugees in South Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Yiting, a leader in the charitable circles of this city, although he left Shanghai a few days ago, is still extremely concerned about the refugees in Shanghai. He has now donated 100 yuan in national currency, which was delivered by his son, Ji Mei, to Mr. Qu Wenliu, the chairman of the International Relief Committee, for the relief of refugees in the southern district.</p>
<h3>British Infantry Relieved</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that the 1st Battalion of the British Highland Light Infantry will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 23rd) on the Dilwara mail ship to replace the 5th Battalion of the Royal Ulster Rifles. The Ulster troops are scheduled to leave for Hong Kong on Thursday. It is said that a part of them will go to Hong Kong, a part will go to Palestine, and the rest of the British troops will remain in Shanghai, so the strength has not been reduced.</p>
<h3>Temporary Night Schools Universally Established in Municipal Council Schools</h3>
<p>The primary and secondary schools established by the Municipal Council were universally established in various districts before the war. After the outbreak of the war, they were moved to safe areas. However, due to the large number of students, and because most of the other private schools were closed, in order to prevent adults and school-age children from losing their education, temporary night schools have recently been universally established in many places.</p>
<h3>Robbers Arrested in Asia Hotel Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Six Robbers Arrested One After Another, Stolen Goods From a Brothel Confiscated</p>
<p>Wu Zhenghua, who opened a rice store in Yangjiadu, Pudong, heard about the outbreak of the Shanghai war, and because the area was close to the war zone, he took his family to Shanghai to take refuge in Room 237 of the Asia Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. At 6:30 p.m. on the 20th of this month, several robbers suddenly broke in with weapons and robbed them of 2,600 yuan in property. When they fled with the stolen goods, they were discovered by nearby Chinese police, who chased after them. When they reached Guangdong Road, the robbers opened fire to resist arrest. The Chinese police also drew their guns and returned fire, resulting in the robber Rong Mingsheng being shot and killed on West Shanglin Street. A stray bullet also killed Zheng Anrong, the watchman of Fu Yu Garden. The remaining robbers escaped, and the body was taken to the coroner's office. The case was reported to the First Special Court for examination a few days ago. Since the occurrence of this case, the Public Concession Police Department, because of the recent proliferation of robbers within the settlement, issued a general order to the detectives of all police stations to strictly investigate. Until the afternoon of the other day, the chief Chinese detective of the General Police Station, Su Changsheng, detectives Tang Zengxiang and Zhang Xiaolin, and western detective Lu Si, arrested the robber Ma Lientai at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Guangdong Road. Subsequently, in Room 15 of the Xingzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road, No. 3, Race Course Road, and No. 37, Lane 69, Route Cardinal Mercier in the French Concession, they continued to arrest six accomplices, Mao Liangeng, Mao Jingeng, Mao Pengshi, Yuan A'gen, and Xu Wenbing. Two revolvers, twelve bullets, 170 yuan in banknotes, and jewelry such as bracelets, beads, and rings were confiscated. After investigation by the detectives, it was found that the arrested robbers and the dead Rong Mingsheng were accomplices. It was also learned that the jade bracelets and other items were stolen from a brothel at No. 31 Huile Lane. An order was given to take them into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. The police lawyers Ru Bao'yi and Li Zhishan stated the case and requested detention. Judge Feng approved it.</p>
<h3>Private Production of Counterfeit Money Sentenced to Eight Years</h3>
<p>Shen A'rong from Shanghai and Qiao Yuhe from Shandong recently organized a counterfeit money manufacturing organization at No. 40 Madrid Road on Mohawk Road. The Singza Police Station cracked the case and seized a large number of counterfeit five-yuan notes of the Bank of China, five-yuan and one-yuan notes of the Central Bank, five-yuan notes of the Hebei Provincial Bank, and one hundred copper coin tickets of the Shandong Ping City Official Money Bureau, with a total value of more than 10,000 yuan. After the police lawyers Wang Yaotang and Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court according to law, the case has been concluded after interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai announced the verdict, sentencing Shen and Qiao to eight years of imprisonment each, and depriving them of public rights for ten years each. The counterfeit banknotes were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Refugee Area Registration Update</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that the registration of refugees in the Nanshi refugee area is nearing completion. About 50,000 of them are original residents of the area, and 70,000 are from other parts of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Postal Service Updates for Nanshi and Other Places</h3>
<p>(Express Letters for Nanshi and Other Places) According to Shanghai Post Office news, all express letters sent to Nanshi and the city center of Shanghai are now stored at the Jiangxi Road Postal Branch for collection. The storage period is limited to ten days. If they are not collected after the deadline, they will be returned to the original sending office.</p>
<p>(Post Offices in Nanshi and Other Places) Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1434 states that the postal branches in Nanshi, Pudong, and Longhua in this district have all been temporarily moved to other offices. The names of the current offices where these branches are located are listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Municipal Council School News</h3>
<p>North District Primary School Moves Back to School Building, Jingzhou Road Primary School Resumes Classes Immediately</p>
<p>The North District Primary School and the Jingzhou Road Primary School, which rented the Yunzhong Girls' Middle School on Avenue Haig and opened classes together, recently heard that because of the large number of students, the temporary school building of Yunzhong was not enough. At the same time, the order near Zhabei has gradually been restored. Therefore, the North District Primary School moved back to its original school building on Connon Road and has already resumed classes. The Jingzhou Road Primary School has rented part of the building of the Daozhong Girls' Middle School at the intersection of Avenue Haig and Datong Road as a temporary school building, and officially resumed classes yesterday.</p>
<h3>Pedestrian Injured by Military Vehicle</h3>
<p>At 2:40 p.m. yesterday, U.S. Army military transport vehicle No. 17 struck a man wearing a short black serge jacket in front of the Sincere Company's South China Goods Department at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, causing serious injuries to his legs and waist. He was taken to the hospital by the Indian police who arrived at the scene.</p>
<h3>Tao Gengyu's Earnest Heart for Saving the World</h3>
<p>Dr. Tao Gengyu, a medical consultant in internal medicine, gynecology, and pediatrics hired by the Shanghai Newspaper Industry Association, is widely known for his extensive experience. The wife of Zhang Caisheng, a worker, suffered from Yin deficiency and throat obstruction, and could not swallow water and could not sleep all night. She was treated by many doctors, but none of them were effective. Fortunately, Dr. Tao treated her carefully, and she was able to turn danger into safety. In addition, Zhao Changlin of the Machinery Department suffered from severe damp-heat, with a persistent high fever and was in critical condition, but Dr. Tao was able to bring him back to life. Such examples are too numerous to mention. He is truly a Hua Tuo reborn. Dr. Tao's clinic has always been located in Yongxing Lane, Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession. Recently, in order to help those who are taking refuge in Shanghai, he does not care about the consultation fee.</p>
