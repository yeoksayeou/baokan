<h3>新年感言</h3>
<p>— 孔祥熙</p>
<p>歲序更新，履端棨始。二十六年元旦，今又來臨。迴溯民國締造之初，頑固思想與惡劣勢力，彌漫全國，不易掃除。紛擾十餘年，雖經無數先烈之犧牲奮鬬，而革命主義民族力量，仍未能完全表現於世界。自十五年蔣院長奉命北伐，未幾戡定全國，建都南京，國民政府始得成立，迄今又已十許年矣。此十許年來，外則强力壓迫，攘奪我邊圍，經濟侵略，搖動市場；內則匪患縱橫，兵革不息，金融枯竭，農村崩潰，無日不在驚濤駭浪之中，我全國同胞在蔣院長領導之下，秉承中央旣定之國策，共同戮力，艱苦奮鬬，忍辱國强，始獲得有今日之成績。試就廿五年之情形觀之。中央政令推行全國，統一之業差告完成。各項建設邁進不已，金融安定，生產增多，民衆教育漸能普及，禦侮精神舉國一致，國家民族已進入於復興之途徑。國際視聽亦為之頓改舊觀。吾人方引為大慰。不料十二月十二日西安又有驚人之變，其時中外驚駭，若大難之將至，遑遑不可終日，猶幸首事諸人悔禍，為時甚速，蔣院長於二十五日安然返京。滿天陰霾，一掃而空。吾人於此短促期中默察事變發生以來，各方種種應付之表示，以及民衆擁護熱烈之情緒，深有感於今日之中國非復昔日之中國；而民族復興之希望，殆將以此次事變為試金石，毫無可疑也。當事變發生之時，政治軍事頓感困難。假令政府組織稍不健全，勢必至倉皇失措，動搖全局；而此次中央應付陝變，當機立斷，一方謀領袖之安全，一方守旣定之國策，從容鎭靜，屹然不驚，此足以證明中樞之組織鞏固者一。</p>
<p>政治之變動最易影響於金融，自改革幣制以還，準備充實，外滙平穩，法幣信用早已昭示中外。此次事變發生，賴國內外金融界切實與政府合作，故能市塲安堵，一如平日。此足以證明金融之基礎穩定者二。</p>
<p>中央地方原為一體；陜變發生，各省軍民長官信使不絕於道，一致擁護中央，營救領袖；關於各項政務，仍能照常進行，維持治安，不遺餘力，此足以證明地方與中央之團結堅固者三。</p>
<p>智識份子為民衆之表率，此次各大學教授各學術團體，力持正義，發爲讜言，俾是非之公論，皎然如日月之經天，此足以證明政治學衛之趨向一致者四。</p>
<p>此次事變發生，自農工商界以至販夫走卒，莫不奔走呼號，營救領袖，及蔣院長返京之日，全國各地歡聲雷動，咸出至誠。蓋個人與國家之安危，領袖與民族之之存亡，其不可分離之關係已深印入人人之腦中，此足以證明民衆之知識進步者五。</p>
<p>自東北淪亡，我國國際地位每况愈上，至去年全國統一，國際輿論始漸轉變。此次事變發生，各國朝野對於蔣院長莫不表深切之同情，目對於政府之從容應變，均表好評，此足以證明國際之地位增進者六。</p>
<p>西安事變發生。全國各將領莫不義憤填應，請纓恐後，其調赴前方者，慷慨赴難之情緒，尤為激烈，此足以證明將士之踴躍用命者七。</p>
<p>綏邊將士忠勇衛國，累建奇動，此次事變發生，仍本其同仇敵愾之精神，繼續奮鬬，而後方之補充，與前綫之慰勞，亦不因陝變而稍鬆懈。此足以證明禦侮之精神貫澈者八。</p>
<p>西安少數部隊，一時迷惑，刦持統帥，及為全國以大義相責，與蔣院長精誠所感，知其行為悖謬，誤中於反動之煽惑，不能見容於國人，旋卽悔過輸誠，禮送蔣院長回京，束身待罪，此足以證明反動派之煽惑無效者九。</p>
<p>自事變以來，全國上下，各本其愛護國家領袖之眞誠，發揮正義，聲討罪人；而輿論界之宣傳尤為努力。中央飛機於西安天空播散京滬各報，驚醒肇禍者之迷夢，收效甚捷，此足以證明輿論之勢力偉大者十。</p>
<p>凡此諸端事實具在。吾·人於痛定之餘月睹此良好之現象，不禁有驚喜過望之感。蓋我國家民族之力量，已漸呈露於世界之前，而蔣院長十年以來堅苦卓絕，歷盡艱險，不惜犧牲個人以拯救國家民族之大願，得此亦可以稍慰。語云，殷憂啟聖，多雞興邦，自今以往，我全国在蔣院长领导之下，益當憂勤惕勵，继续努力，贯澈此種愛國家愛領袖之精神，完成復興民族之大業，吾人所深切期待者尚有二點。（一）自力更生之奮鬬。現代民族之能生存於世界者，全賴民族自身之力量發揮光大，始可與其他民族互相雜繋，共保世界之和平。斷未有倚仗他力，而能得倖存之理。我中國民族具有數千年之歷史，致病之源，山於個人之觀念重，國家之觀念輕，缺乏嚴密之組織，與深刻之訓練。故雖有能耐勞苦之美德，而力量散漫，不能集中，因循坐誤，幾肇亡國之禍。觀於此次綏邊之役，與西安之變，民族力量，一經表現，卽可以抵禦外侮，消弭內憂，若再加以磨礪，并為進步之精神團結，使民族力量不至分散，充分表現於救國之一途，則民族前途之光榮，當可預卜。</p>
<p>［二）對於中心主義之堅確信仰，與擁護自總理制定民主義主張恢復民族道德。以為救國之指南針。蔣院長今日之能得人民擁護者，卽在遵守總理遺教，身體力行，並無他道。故國民之眞擁護蔣院長者，不單只擁護個人，而在擁護此救國之中心主義，並不單只以擁護為畢事，更須人人堅確信仰此主義，力行此主義，無論何種異說，凡與中心主義相背者，不為之搖撼分毫，則合全國億兆人心為一心，任伺强力不得而摧毀，國之復興，可以操勞而獲。此吾人於欣慰之餘，更有無限之希望者</p>
<p>當西安事變發動之時，祥熙適留滬療病。因奉中央决議，於蔣院長離京時期，暫攝院務，卽晚力疾回京，任重材輇，原不敢荷此鉅責。祇以束髮受書，差知大義，值茲黨國危亡之際，不得不勉任其難。浹句以來，一切內政外交，悉遵旣定之國策，繼續進行，幸無貽誤。此皆賴我政院同仁各地長官竭誠贊助，而全國同胞之一致擁護中央，信任政府之力，尤有足多。茲幸蔣院長業已回京，繼續主持大計，祥煕得以稍輕責任，仍得追隨同仁之後，在其領導之下，共濟時艱。茲值開歲之始，聊為獻歲之言，示我國人，並對各方之贊助關切，致其欣謝之意，幸垂察焉。</p>

<h3>日本政變說（下）</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>外交失敗，“庶政一新”未實現，預算案雖已在閣議通過，但尚待議會之審查。因此，日本各報各雜誌，最近正熱心的為廣田算命。</p>
<p>不過，政黨內閣是早被軍部否定了，不願聽命於軍部的好老，也是不能組閣的。目前只是準戰時，在大戰未爆發前，甚麼人來組閣才適當呢？日本政論家們，多半猜想着廣田後的內閣，必是宇垣内閣，因宇垣旣是軍部以出身，又是統治殖民地的一等好手，並且各政黨中，正不少宇垣的捧場人物。但軍部中的少壯派，却有許多是不滿意宇垣的。“二二六事變”，正是少壯派發動的，若不將少壯派疏通好，宇垣也未必敢“拜受大命”。今日的貴族院議長近衛公，也正是因為對付軍部無把握，才不敢接受西園寺老公的推薦，否則“二二六事變”後的第一任內閣，已經是近衛內閣而不是廣田內閣了。</p>
<p>今日的廣田內閣，旣非政黨內閣，也非貴族內閣，而是聽命於軍部的官僚內閣。軍部很明白，官僚本身只有官做便行。八分聽命，二分妞妮，正是官僚本像。用他八分聽命，來完成戰時準備，他的二分妞妮，也恰好做為軍部和政黨的緩衝地帶。三十億四千萬元以上的空前預算，只在一點半鐘內便通過閣議，這，若非官僚的廣田內閣就不能辦到吧？</p>
<p>軍部不能不承認日本的憲政，當然不能不承認合法的正黨。在今日，軍部不願有政黨內閣成立，只願利用官僚內閣。到明日，若軍部所扶植的政黨長成，那當然又是另一種說法了。最近日本主義的法西各團體，已在進行統一工作。十二月十五日第一次組織協議會開會時，參加者除建川美次中將和小林省三郎中將外，尚有“國體擁護聯合會”，“大日本靑年黨”，及“大日本生產黨”……等各種最右翼團體的代表列席，協議組織“維新政黨”。這分明是軍部的企圖，預備用政黨的力量打擊政黨。</p>
<p>廣田內閣縱在最近的將來收塲，廣田型的內閣，在大戰未爆發以前，也必是不會完全消失的。不過，像現在的大藏大臣馬場的本係日本銀行家，此次的大增稅，卽由他一手實現。廣田內閣的繼任，會是此類最積極的銀行家也說不定。總之，繼任者必是更積極的廣田型內閣，這大概是不會錯的。</p>
<p>中日間的“防共協定”及“華北問題”正擱淺，日俄間的“漁業條約”，又因日獨防共協定成立，未能簽字，這是近來廣田內閣被攻擊的主要目標之一。但據十二月二十二日的東京各報夕刋載，漁業條約，蘇聯雖不願簽字，但已表示願成立一種暫時協定了。這消息似乎可使射擊廣田的弓手們眼花一陣，尤其重要的是，中國突然發生了西安事變，在此事變中，廣田內閣—其實是軍部—也突然表示“靜觀”，及分外的關心。在此靜觀及關心下，內蒙的德王也聲明停戰了，靑島曾經上陸的海軍陸戰隊也撤退了。廣田內閣認為這是“中日國交好轉”的一大機會，也正是防衛現內閣倒場的主要條件。</p>
<p>决定廣田內閣的運命的，固然是军部。但，無寗說是在“鄰邦”的變動上。（十二月二十二日）</p>

<h3>二十六年元旦感言</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>今日為民國成立之紀念。亦年序建旦之良辰。自來每逢歲首。例有祝願之什。協淑風於億兆。慶休祚之翔集。除舊布新。繼往開來。義有可取。情非得已。國難以還。人心不寗。雖强顏以為歡。多意隳而氣沮。然竊有不能已於言者。人生活動之意義端賴希望為維繋。有希望斯有企圖。有企圖乃期進步一切奮鬬之成功。孰非希望所鞭策。環境縱云恶劣。必期自我改善。途雖多荆棘。應知發憤為雄。則際茲歲序乍更之時節。正吾人磨厲以須之機會。椒花之頌可廢。辟惡之酒宜斟。振奮意氣。鼓舞熱情。滌過去之蕪瑕。策未來之精爽。祥光郁靄。佳氣蔥籠。二十六年之元旦。固國運剝復之肇端。民族康强之起點也。</p>
<p>自陝變突發。一國軍車最高領袖。竟至橫遭刧持。無法施行職權當時論者。頗謂首事者敢于兆如斯驚人之巨變。殆非旦夕咄嗟可望弭平。藉令兵連禍結。必至外患乘之。國族前途寗復堪。間然而事實之所昭示。竟使大局急轉直下。不僅被困各將領。盡獲自由。且令事變負責者束身待罪。而留居西安之蔣委員長。遂得於不盡殘臘之五日前。翩然歸京。滔天大患。幸告渙消。萬衆歡騰。理有固然。其在外交方面。幾經談判遷延不决之成都北海两案。亦已於除夕前一日雙方換文解决。殆欲為二十五年收束不祥之已事。而更為二十六年创造新生之機能者。關於國運剝復之前徵。此其一。當綏戰發生。前綫將士。投袂奮起。無小無大。從公于邁。而後方輸將之踴躍。尤具莫遏之趨勢。迨蔣委員長被留西安。全國領導。失其重心。杌陧之狀。隨在可見。假令控制一失其宜。可使全局立趨糜爛。時則政府以堅毅之態度。謀沉着之應付。人民以鎮靜之步驟。佇領袖之歸來。臨危局而不紊。集意志于一體。關於民族復興之預卜。此其二。</p>
<p>基上所言。是知國族已奠團結之基礎。斷非外力所能任意而摧隳。然而吾人亦不可認為事有轉機。便得自趨怠逸。誠應把握時會。力求前進。保持統一之局面。維護整個之國策。內而充實自己之力量。外以發揚民族之精神。如此。則國家主權。可期貫澈。東亞和平。庶有保障。人之欲善。誰不如我。舉國淬厲。當自今始。</p>

<p>［莫斯科］此間今日宣布、蘇俄政府已準備與英法合作、阻止外人參加西班牙內戰、惟提出條件四項、（一）所有不干涉協定簽字國家、咸以有效之方法、立刻節制外籍志願軍流入西班牙、（二）此項控制辦法、必須與西班牙左翼將領之態度毫無關係、（三）簽字國家必須組織正式或非正式之代表團、監視志願軍人之是否流入西班牙倘有流入、須立刻公布、㊃上述條件必須立刻生効、以便阻止外籍軍人之增加、按第二項條件、與不干涉協定委員會之政策、頗不相符、因該會對待左右雙方、並無軒輊、而第三項則可使蘇俄註西使領、報告德國軍人之開抵西境云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］蘇俄外委李維諾夫今日答覆英法牒文、聲明蘇俄願無條件贊同、禁止義勇隊開往西班牙、並謂蘇俄得悉邇來西班牙國民軍獲德意兩國人民之協助、若輩皆結隊乘特備船雙開往西班牙、就其狀熊及軍備與特調之船雙諸點觀之、决不能認此為一种志願運動云、（三十日路透電）</p>
<h3>德擬停派志願軍援助西班牙叛軍說</h3>
<p>意對英法卽提復文　在原則上表示賛同</p>
<p>［柏林］今日據外人方面消息、德國各地義勇軍現已展緩前往西班牙、以待希特勒元首决定今後對於西班牙內戰之方針、可靠方面披露、西班牙目前共有德國義勇軍一萬人、意人較少、法人則在四萬人至五萬人之間、宣傳部及外交部發言人今日均非笑意相墨索里尼要求希特勒從速退出西班牙之說、謂德國無需外國之忠告云、德國陸軍軍官對於西班牙政府軍中俄人駕駛飛機及坦克車之成效、大為驚異、此輩軍官素不信蘇俄軍備有何威力、現則漸信蘇俄不僅擁有歐洲最大之空軍、且其空軍在歐洲方面亦最勁精、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］聞意國對於英法不干涉西班牙內戰之建議、其覆文將予以原則上之贊同、但將要求確切保證表同情於瑪德里政府之國、尤其為法俄兩國、悉須維持不干涉協定、該覆文一二日內卽將發出、（三十日路透電）。</p>
<p>［羅馬］英法兩國政府、日前曾向德意葡俄四國政府、提出照會、勸告各該國勿再派遣志願兵、前往西班牙投効、茲悉意國政府對於該照會之覆文、將於旦夕間送出、政界人士確信、意國此項復文、縱使辭句與德國所當提出之復文、並不完全相同、然其大意、則屬一貫、質言之、意德兩國復文、當在原則上接受、將西班牙內亂不干涉辦法、加以擴充、而將禁止志願兵投効一項辦法、包括在內、但此項辦法實施之際、自應顧全實際事實云、（卅日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於西班牙內亂不干涉辦法實施時嚴格監察之一事、上星期中、曾由調整委員會、照會各關係國政府、請其表示意見、茲悉意大利政府、業已提出答覆、對於嚴格監察一項建議、表示贊成、意國現雖繼續主張、凡屬間接干涉西班牙內亂之各項問題、應整個提付討論、但間接干涉、有種種不同之形式、自應逐項加以研究、而為實際上便利起見、不妨將禁止志願兵投效一項問題、最先提出研究、此在意國已在原則上接受禁止志願兵投効之辦法、但須以各國均接受此項建議、而嚴格予以遵守為條件、卽任何私人、前往西班牙者、亦應一概加以禁止、意大利政府次復要求、將西班牙內戰當事雙方貯存國外之現金、一律“中立化”並應禁止公開募集欵項、以供內戰當事任何一方之用云、調整委員會所屬兩股員會、卽處理“志願兵投効”與“財政接濟”兩項問題者、現定於明日在外務部開會、以審核意國政府之復文、聞英法兩國政府、對於禁止任何私人前往西班牙之一層、認為與各該國現行法律相抵觸、碍難實行、至於存金“中立化”之辦法、亦難以實施、蓋西班牙內戰當事雙方、在倫敦巴黎所存現金、均不用政府名義、而僅用私人名義、此在倫敦、係用私人名義、以存金委託銀行保管、而各該銀行、對於委託保管人之姓名、在職務上負有保守秘密之義務、至在巴黎、則西國當事雙方、往往化名向銀行租賃保險箱、以貯藏現金、此類保險箱、必須提出訴訟、方可由司法當局命令開騐、故欲禁止此項存金之提取、實際上困難、殊屬冗多也、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德船釋放德政府滿意</h3>
<p>西班牙叛軍　派代辦駐德意</p>
<p>［柏林］德政府對於西班牙政府迅速釋放德船巴洛斯號、似頗滿意、今日官立通訊社發表一公報、稱讚德巡洋艦哥尼斯堡號之艦長辦理此案、認眞而謹愼、惟對於船中之西班牙乘客一人為西班牙當局逮捕、並船中之貨物一部分亦為西班牙當局沒收、表示遗憾、蓋該船所載貨物、並無戰品也、公報中要求完全清理此二事、（三十日路透电）</p>
<p>［巴黎］西班牙駐法大使館、頃發表公告、內稱、德國商船“巴洛斯”號、自經巴斯克自治邦當局放行之後、德國巡洋艦“葛尼斯堡號、艦長卽用德國政府名義、向自治邦政府主席阿基爾發出無綫電報、其性質頗類哀的美頓書、略稱、“巴洛斯”號、係在西班牙海岸外二十三英里、卽公海之上、被西國政府軍軍艦扣留、實屬違反國際法、巴斯克自治邦當局、務當立卽歸還所扣貨物、並將船上西班牙人一名、一併放行、否則種種後果、應由自治邦政府負之云、阿基爾當卽答復稱、“巴洛斯”號係在西國領海之內所扣、且其所載貨物、中有製造砲彈火藥之原料、以及軍用無綫電收發器土具、係屬違禁私運之軍用品、按照國際法、自可加以沒收云、“葛尼斯堡”號艦長、當復電稱、已接到復文、而不及其他、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>亞維拉　德意兩國自承認西班牙國民軍政府之後、卽已分別任命代辦駐在蒲爾哥斯城西班牙國民軍政府、頃亦任命伽西亞為駐意代辦、特埃斯脫拉達為駐德代辦、並派遣領事駐在德國漢堡·佛朗克孚·僧城·各處意國脫利埃斯脫與熱諾亞各城、（三十一日哈瓦電斯）</p>
<h3>瑪德里英使館遷移</h3>
<p>領事館仍保留</p>
<p>瑪德里　英國駐瑪德里大使館、雖將隨西班牙政府而遷移至伐倫西亞、惟現已决定瑪德里之英，领事館、仍舊保留、一般不主張離去該地之英僑聞之均覺稍慰、英僑昨日獲得英政府决定將大使館遷至伐倫西亚之消息後、均感失望、瑪德里英商會曾電英外相艾登、陳述反對英大使館遷移之理由、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>瑪德里　英國代辦福白斯、業已奉命移駐伐朗西亞城、此間最後一批英國僑民、亦定於星期五日、前往亞利岡德城、再由該處分赴法國馬賽港、英屬直布羅陀港、至英國大使館所屬人員、隨後亦當遷往伐朗西亞城、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］外務部日昨命令駐西班牙代辦福白斯、自瑪德里遷往伐朗西亞城、俾與西國共和政府保持直接聯絡、一般人解釋此舉、認為政府欲令瑪德里城內最後一批英國僑民、全數撤退、故先令福白斯離京、至瑪德里城內、或將留駐英國副領事一員、則係一種臨時辦法、乃為保護英國商務利益、且遇必要時、襄助辦理僑民撤退事宜云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國共產黨蘇格蘭支部代表葛利根、前於本月十八日編成蘇格蘭志願兵一隊、計一百五十人派往西班牙助政府軍作戰、萬利根現又續行招蘇格蘭人編成隊伍以便派往西班牙、據葛利根估計、至明年一月底蘇格蘭人助政府軍作戰者、將有五百名之多云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>一九三六年日本政治經濟回顧</h3>
<p>［東京］多事之一九三六年、倖免於預期之大難而卒得度過、誠屬萬幸、日本在此一年中、雖於內外情勢各方遭遇許多空前嚴重事故、亦與世界其他各國差幸平和的進入一九三七年、此種事實、可認為遠東之幸運、二二六事變為日本今年最嚴重之事件、人所共知、廣田內閣於事變廣大深刻之反響中、成立以“肅軍”“庶政一新”為其最大任務、賴寺內陸相十個月來之努力、“肅軍”獲相當成就、但其代價則為空前的擴軍計劃、已由內閣通過而向議會提出、至“庶政一新”之討論仍在繼續、尚無結果、本年八月中、內閣發表之七項政治計晝、雖其半已納入下年度預算草案中、其他半則尚在詳細審查、因此引起各方之紛紛責難、“庶政一新”最嚴重最複雜之工作、厥為行政機構之改革、廣田對此正費躊躇、因其牽涉日本政治之基本組織也、日本决定增加軍備計畫、採行所謂“準戰時體制”大規模的增稅計畫及日德協定、足以顯示日本在經濟及外交方面之“準戰時體制”、行政機構改革如獲實現、則政治方面亦成“準戰時體制”、故此點為本問題之重要點、雖行政機構將來終不免若干改革、但其改革之程度能否使主張改革者滿意、尚成問題、此為决定廣田內閣命運因素之一”、</p>
<p>日本內政之另一棘手問題、為議會制度之改造、某方欲削弱議會權力、增强及集中內閣勢力為行政機構、成為“準戰時體制”之前提、因議會權力為憲法所賦予、欲加任何限制、勢必涉及憲法問題、政黨以議會為其最後生命綫、故議會權力苟受限制、政黨卽無異崩潰、故本屆議會關於政府對議會之信念、必將提出嚴峻鋒利之質問、廣田內閣能否明確肯定的表示、其信念將為决定內閣命運之又一因素、</p>
<p>本屆議會最重要之問題、莫過於增稅計畫、此案對人民生活影響之巨大、空前無比、故人民咸望議會予以打消、然議會在政府人民間處境兩難、苟予以通過則危反人民之抗議、更損政黨權威、若加反對、則有促成自身解散之虞、縱政府無解散議會之决心、至少將增加政黨與某方之齟齬、亦卽政黨政治之嚴重危機也、此為决定廣田內閣命運之又一因素、</p>
<p>外交失敗、雖仍為强烈攻擊之目標、但因日澳商約之訂立及日蘇漁業條約之延長、顯已趨於緩和、本屆議會第一日、極右派政黨如國民同盟等、緊急動議質問政府之外交、雖經政友民政兩黨勸止、未加討論、但已充分顯露議會空氣之緊張、日德協定將為議會質問焦點之一、當無疑義、日蘇新漁業條約未獲蘇聯之簽字、亦將成為不可推諉之嚴重外交責任、中日談判之失敗、尤使反對政府外交政策之各方意見加强、近數日中、一般見解以為政黨對外交問題須加審愼、但議會顯不欲任其輕易過去、現內閣對議會之應付苟走錯一步、則將有嚴重之發展、此又為廣田內閣命運之决定點、</p>
<p>上述四點、不僅足以表現今年日本內政外交之特徵、亦為來年趨勢之前瞻、廣田內閣繼續存在與否、遠不若將來趨勢之重要、最後吾人應注意於日本對華之政策、西安事變後、日本人民對華之觀念有新的改變、當事變之始、少數日人不明中國最近情形、曾有不正確之觀察、但智識階級大都以為中國不致僅因西安事變、重陷混亂、迨事跡解决、使日本各方瞿然驚覺認識中國政治金融幣制各項組織之穩固、逈出意想之外、蔣委員長在事變中、不啻經過中國人民之一度信任投票、尤使日人為之驚異、因此“勿以萬觀念應付中國”之意見、益漸有力、因中國統一勢力之加强、明年日本之對華政策、或將不得不着重於經濟合作、記者堅信因中國統一益加穩固及不屈不撓之外交應付、明年之中日關係將漸呈好轉、</p>
<p>過去一年中、日本經濟方面之重要發展、可如下述、（一）準戰時性益趨積極、（二）生產各部門之矛盾日形尖銳、（三）大量入超、（四）龐大預算及增稅計畫之决定、（五）民衆生活日益困苦、自寺內陸相就任、高唱國防的普遍意識及增强滿洲軍備以來、日本經濟方面之凖戰時性、遂於本年更形邁進矣、本年除國營重工業有驚人的擴充外、受政府補助之私營軍事工業亦均有長足的進展、本年之鋼鐵生產較一九三二年增加三倍、為日本軍備生產中心之一的電氣事業、其資本較一九三二年增加百倍之多、此點尤堪注意、政府依動員之基礎、對日本經濟生活之各方面幾均加以統制、且日益嚴峻、始則頒布統制各種重要工業及汽車工業之法律、繼又頒布肥料統制法·修改匯兌統制法•訂立貨幣統制法·增强進出口统制、置各保險公司於政府管理之下、合併各地方銀行等、又如稅收之集中•電氣事業之改歸國營•可供軍備利用之工業生產標準化•地方工業與軍備工業之聯繫等、均為趨向戰時經濟之重要步驟、惟因軍事工業之畸形發展、致普通經濟大失平衡、如本年冶金生產之平均指數高至二六六、（一九二八年為一○○）而絲織品僅為一二二、食物飲料則更低至九九、再者日本缺乏原料之嚴重情形、因軍傭工業之癲狂的發展全盤暴露、川口神戶兩地數百家中小冶金工廠、近以缺乏生鐵而致停閉、失業工人不計其數、本年在軍備需要下、國內生產力之竭蹶、將因明年之龐大軍事預算而更加甚焉、殆無庸疑一九三六年之日本國際貿易、在質量兩方、均呈衰退、有一億三千三百萬圓之入超、較一九三五年增百分之八十五、進口貨之四分之一、為軍備材料、而主要出口貨棉布及麥粉、則降低百分之三、三及四十八、在與日本有貿易關係之一二七國中、抵制日貨者增至七十六國、日英•日印、日荷•日埃•日加•貿易會商、或則未能繼績、或則毫無結果、本年控制日本貿易之諸因素、明年惟有益加甚焉、本年日本付出之黃金達二億五千萬圓之鉅、打破一九三一年之紀錄、而尤堪驚異者、則新預算達三十億四千萬圓、超出本年度四分之一以上、較一九三一年則逾二倍、除去給予地方政府之特別欵項不訐外、陸軍單獨卽佔有百分之四·九九、若包括補助飛機及化學工業欵項、則日本一九三七年之國防預算、總數達一億七千八百萬圓、比較任何非戰時國家為巨、僅大戰前乏德意志堪與伯仲、同時救濟鄉村中小工業之欵項僅有二千四百萬圓、尚不及總支出百分之一、以安定民生活為標榜之廣田內閣、不啻自食前言、馬場藏相旣允諾三十億四千萬圓之預算、乃不得不藉助於增稅至十四億二千四百萬圓之鉅、卽較本年度增多五億圓或百分之五十五、一面發行赤字公債九億六千一百萬圓、增稅計劃之大部份項目及數種新稅、均使民衆負担為之大增、其結果將使稅收减少其彈力性、同時日本之損資力量减至七億圓弱、（一九一零年有十九億一千萬圓、一九三五年有八億圓）發行公債計劃能否成功大成問題、日本公債額本年已超過一百億圓、此後六年中每年增加十億圓、至一九四一年卽達一百六十億圓、雖據為場藏相之計劃、自一九四一年以後每年减少發行公債一億圓、直至一九四九年可以不再舉債、屆時日政府負債將達二百億圓之鉅、此種說法、殊使日本人民焦慮不置也、政府當局雖拒絕承認日本現已陷入惡性膨脹、但此事在今年已趨明顯試、一察紙幣發行數額、卽知由今年歲首至十二月廿九日已由十二億圓激增至二十億圓之鉅、若就建造軍備及物價高漲等而論、惡性膨脹在明年必將更為劇烈、在此種情勢之下、感受嚴重威脅者、無疑的為數百萬之日本勞動大衆、生活費增高為、對彼等直接威脅之一、據官方統計、今年歲杪已達二○三·五、一九○○年之生活費為一○○、另一方面貨幣工資已貶至八十一（非實質工資）、據官方統計今年首九個月勞工爭議計一四五七件、較上年同期多二三七件、此非偶然之事、至於農村不安較前增加亦不容忽視、據最近農林省統計、佃戶爭議至一九三六年七月底止之一年間共六八二四件、約較前一年同期增多一千件、總之、日本已以非常高度發展之“準戰時體制”進入一九三七年矣、因有反對與不安、究能許此種體制延續若干時間、誠為需要精密探討之問題也、（三十一日中央社電）</p>
<h3>鮑爾温元旦頌詞</h3>
<p>祝今歲為和平年</p>
<p>［倫敦］首相鮑爾溫定於元旦日、在保守黨“葵花聯合會”、發表頌詞、藉以追述一年來之施政情形、茲悉其內容略稱“政府在過去一年中、劉於外交上種種問題、甚為焦念、歐洲時局、杌隉不安、結果多數人民、均深信英國苟欲避免他國攻擊、而為和平局勢之中流砥柱、則政府現行之外交政策、實乃唯一可能之政策、此層余蓋深信不疑、至就擴充軍備程序而論、此乃為應付世界局勢而然、歐洲各國、現旣紛紛擴張軍備、則在英國、無論何人執政對於軍備、自不能加以、忽視、但各種軍事行動、凡其目的、係與國聯會盟約相牴觸者、英國决不出兵參加、各國固不必以英國抱有侵略意向為慮也、英國政府、前此原已竭盡所能、希冀經由締結國際協定之途徑、以促使各國减縮軍備、直至吾人此種努力、顯然失敗之後、本國政府、始乃决定將防禦性貿之國防設備、加以充實”、此際雖有多數問題、足以擾亂並威脅世界和平、但余深信、一九三七年、必為“和平之年”、而英國國勢、亦當益臻隆盛云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美國鮮果對法輸出減少</h3>

<h3>一年來的科學進步</h3>
<p>— Eric　N.　Davis伯懇譯</p>
<p>在新聞雜誌上，常見描寫着重要的公共事件的生動的文章。假如有人也這樣地來叙述任何一年中科學的成就，那他就會覺得許多困難。</p>
<p>今日的記錄，到了明天就會被另一奇蹟埋沒掉，過一星期就會幾乎被人遺忘。若干星期以前，一個飛行家成就了一件破天荒的創舉，就是：他飛到離地面將近十哩的天空；可是，誰能預料，在這事件尚未公布的時候，另一更幸運的伊卡勒斯（lcarus）會飛到更接近太陽的天空而且平安地回來呢？</p>
<p>無論如何，現在非目力所及的天文學領域不欠會收入攝影器的鏡頭的，因為巴洛馬山（MountPa1omar)上二百吋的望遠鏡頭已經鑄造成功，再加一番文複雜又費時間的磨琢工夫，就可應用。這巨鏡大約是不塗銀而“塗鋸”，（Auminized因為有人發見，鋁勝於銀的優點很多很多！在不久的將來，“塗銀的鏡”大概會絕迹於全世界的大天文台的吧。</p>
<p>銀河新發見</p>
<p>一九三六年，是天文學家值得記憶的年份，因為在這年份，哈佛天文台主任沙浦里博士（Dr:SbaPley)宣布了銀河的“窗戶”（Window）的發見，從這“窗戶”人類第一次能够從混沌浩渺的雲霧中間窺看宇宙的深底，而且，據報告，因這發明而被發見的不同的新星，已達一百四十七顆之多了。</p>
<p>至於對近物的察視，科學已經藉“電子像管”（Electron　image　tube）——這是用螢光簾（Fluoescent　screen）當作人造網膜的——的發明，使人類得到幾乎四倍於平常視界的“眼睛”。在這網膜上，“電子像管”接受而且傳達明白的景象，這景象是藉人目看不到的紅外綫（Infra-red　rays)——亦稱“黑光”——傳達過來的。除天文學方面以外，還有醫藥方面，生物學方面，以及軍事方面，都期待着從這新發明的器械獲得巨大的利益。</p>
<p>在軍事方面，最新式的海軍用砲彈能夠穿過十二吋原的鐵甲板，而且發出以後不致破損。瑞士人發明的飛機大砲（平常只能發射機關槍彈），每分鐘可以射發炸彈八百枚。</p>
<p>玻璃屋</p>
<p>除那些破壞性的以外，還有其他關於天空的問題。固然，打破同溫層最高記錄的人御氣球尚未發見，但那些携帶自動記錄器的小氣球却常常投射到雲層以上的高空，研究那不停地激撞着地球的宇宙光（Cosmic　rays）的神秘問題。</p>
<p>雖然關於宇宙光的起源的問題迄今尚在爭論中，但宇宙光能够通過任何障碍物則已一致承認了。所以供建築用的玻璃磚會因宇宙光而破裂這一種憂盧，是沒有理由的。玻璃磚是半透明而不透明的；可以把全部光線近百分之八十放入用這種磚建造的房屋的內部。</p>
<p>然而單是日光不能完全保障健康，至少就遺傳與環境所擺布的個體來說是如此。凡人的肉體還是非捱受着許多疾病不可的。可是，賴着化學家與內外科醫生的合作，關於病源與有効治療的研究已日見進步了。</p>
<p>五種新元素</p>
<p>若干種疾病，幾年前認為不可治療的，目前已可治療或功了。就一般說，是藉有系統的長時期研究所得的方法，有時却也由於不曾預料的偶然的發見。</p>
<p>例如，以島素（Insulin）治療糖尿症，固然是新近發明的事，但據最近發見，要是把鋅加入注射液中，則島素的作用的壽命可以延長不少。又，經過二年來的試騐，關節炎病患者可藉某種新發見的化學化合物而獲痊愈，而且關節炎病是從傳染而得這一流俗信仰也從此推翻了。</p>
<p>許多年來，科學界一致假定着，眞正存在的元素至多不過九十二種——金，氮，鉛，氧，及其他。可是，據著名的柏休凱首佛爾罕研究院的報告，鈾——最重最復雜的元素——的原子的激撞的結果，產生了至少五種更重更復雜的新元素。</p>
<p>人造原料</p>
<p>和鐳與鈾相同，這幾種新元素都是具放射能的，所以牠們不能穩定地生存着，這大概就是宇宙中為什麼找不到這些新元素的理由吧。因為產生的量額太微小，不免有人懷疑這些新元素的發明是否錯誤，但精細而且準確的化學試騐却十足證明了牠們的存在。</p>
<p>可是，除為知識而追求知識外，化學家還有別的動機在。</p>
<p>目前的世界經濟狀况，儘够引誘着化學家去和自然競争。人造橡皮，雖然和天然產物形式不同，却是一種很有價值的原料。在蘇聯，由酒精製成的人造橡皮產額，去年達二萬五千噸，在一二年內可望增至四萬噸。德國是以這一方面的技術進步著稱的另一國家；美國某工廠每年能製造橡皮類似物達一百萬磅之多。</p>
<p>這些人造原料，並不是全都為替代天然產物而製造的。例如，某鐵路公司製造一種花紋與形式類似木頭的鋼板。又，某種金屬合金，形若黃金，堅勝於鋼，寶際上却是大部分铜與小部分鋍所合成：假如或本可以减輕，此種合金的用途還可大大地推廣起來。</p>
<p>最出色的是什麼？</p>
<p>人造樹脂的用途，日見廣泛，最近發見的與飛機建造有關的用途，顯然會使飛機設計受到深切的影響。事實上，已有人作着預言：目前被認為十分時新的輕捷光亮的低翼單葉飛機，過十年後會變得如一九一八年的雙葉飛機和三葉飛機在目前一般的陳舊。</p>
<p>那麼，一九三六年的種種科學成就中，究竟什麼是可稱為最出色的呢？</p>
<p>回答這個問題，不是一件輕易的工作，因為把這問題向任何人提出時，各人會有各人的偏見的。可是，公衆知道的無綫電傳影（Television）的進步，雖然尚未完全成功而、且所用的器械昂貴，大概不失為一種重要的成就吧。</p>
<p>無綫電交通已造成一種奇蹟，使高山大海所阻隔的不同民族變成鄰人！卽使不是變成朋友。——我們可以這樣希望：實際的視覺是那巨大的鏈索的最後的一環，這鏈索將使不同的個人與國家聯結而成相互友好的團體；到了那時期，科學將放棄破壞性的工作而從容從事於解决目前仍然面對人類的種種問題。</p>

<h3>二十六年元旦吳市長告市民書</h3>
<p>天道行健，不息推進，民國二十五年，又隨時代巨流之過馳，而為人羣歷史之陳蹟。今逢二十六年獻歲之日，適為我革命領袖蔣委員長安旋後之一週。除舊布新，否極泰來，凡我市民，究將如何認識而負起其偉大歷史的任務，振作精神，以完成我中華民族復興之大業，是於歡欣祝慶之餘，所應切實奮勵者也。</p>
<p>鐵城忝長本市，茲已五稔。人事之進展，終不若時間之易邁，馳者如斯，能毋警惕！值茲歲首，回顧旣往，過去之五載，實在在予人以慘痛之敎訓。往歲施政方針，及其進展過程，已歷有宣示，茲不贅陳。顧余歷年所宣示者，果已一一見諸行事乎？是尤不能不為忠實之檢討。以本市地位之重要，應興應革，何止萬端；尤以現代政府職務之激增，都市問題複雜，鐵城雖勉竭愚忠，苦心經營，終以限於財力，格於環境，不獲副原有之期望。大上海都市之建設，乃百年千秋之偉業。市府成立，茲甫十稔，旣往之成就，與將來之理想，其間距離，正復甚遠。瞻望前程，道遠任重，是則尤應與我市民相約，益圖勉進者也。</p>
<p>為政不在多言，貴能埋頭建設；建設不尚虛表，尤貴實事求是，目前國事雖在激急進展之中，然國際風雲，正復緊張；市政為整個國策之一環，則其建設之蔪向，自當以復興民族為前提，俾於整個國家建設，民族復興之過程中，得為一有力之單位。故數年以來，鐵城所努力以赴者，除一般市政應有之設施外，莫不以敎養衛三者兼施為一貫之原則。今後工作，雖種類繁殊；然語其本，當仍無易。謹本斯旨，開陳數義，願我市民，通力合作，共相策勵焉！</p>
<p>［一）關於物質建設者第一，當以積極推行國民經濟建設運動為要務。經濟建設之重要，蔣委員長，已有剴切訓示；時賢學者，尤多論列，可毋贅述。關於本市國民經濟建設運動事宜，早經籌劃進行；開歲以後，更當積極推進。舉凡往年所定之事工，其未依期完成者，如近郊農業之改進，水電交通，以及其他公營事業之擴展，當力圖其實施，其次，為勞動服務之切實實施。現在本市勞動服務，正在進行，由勞動服務委員會負其專責，以疏浚河道等工作為服務之目標。此於水利交通，農民生計，均有裨益。其三，為大規模的展覽會之籌辦。今年為本府成立十週紀念擬乘舉行紀念盛會之期，籌辦大規模的市政展覽會及新興工業手工業展覽會，一以繁榮市區，二以推廣國產。</p>
<p>［二）關於社會建設者—除繼續推進平民福利事業改善平民生計外；餘如市立醫院及衛生試騐所之正式開辦；各處衛生事務所之繼續添建，環境衛生與勞工衛生之改善；人力車夫生活之提高，公共大禮堂與火葬場之建築、原為去年預定計劃。凡此種種，或則有關平民福利，或則有關禮俗改良，均當視財力所及，一一求其實現。</p>
<p>［三）關於精神建設者—其一，為識字敎育之繼續推行；關於此項前經詳言，茲不復贅。其次，為公民訓練之加緊實施。本市公民訓練已有相當成續；公民踴躍忝加，其精神之佳，尤出預期。本年為積極改進起見，復擬開設公民訓練幹部訓練所，選公民學力體力之較優者，施以嚴格訓練，强其體魄，授以技術；砥勵其精神，啟發其思想，以期養成健全有為之公民訓練幹部人才。啟發其思想，以期養成健全有為之公民訓練幹部人才。俾今後公訓，益見成效；公民精神，益臻健全，得負荷其桿衛國家復興民族之偉大使命。</p>
<p>凡右所陳，旨無新異。惟是復興民族，端賴充實國力；救國大業，非可行險徼倖。但問耕耘，莫問收獲。建設一分，國力卽充實一分；努力一分，國運卽進展一分。滬市綰轂南北屏蔽首都，工商百業，旣冠全國；市民精神，影響尤大，其與整個國族之關係實頗為深切。值茲歲首，際舊布新，繼往開來，凡我市民，尤應把握其時代的使命，確認其報國之正途；力避虛浮，脚蹈實地，和衷共濟，通力合作；聽命於整個的國策，埋頭於自力的建設，以完成民族復興之大業焉！</p>

<p>留滬檢驗身體</p>
<p>本人前在西安、咯血甚多、故特向委員長請假來滬就醫、卽將入醫院檢騐身體、暫不他往、何日就西北勦匪前敵總司令之職、及是否將赴閩一行、目前均未决定、委员長以兄喪將返奉化一行、料理喪務、並稍事休養云、</p>

<p>四盗登樓被劫四千五百餘金　拒捕激戰兩捕殒命行人受傷</p>
<p>北京路景雲大楼五楼、於昨晨十一時二十餘分、發生钜刦案一起、被刦四千五百餘金、探捕聞警兜捕、引起激戰、致西捕及司阍捕各一名、皆因公殒命、斃匪名、擒獲一名、流彈傷兩行人、茲將各情紀述於下、</p>
<p>收解較多匪徒垂涎</p>
<p>北京路第三百七十八號景雲大樓五樓第五○八號、乃南潯富商劉姓劉景德堂經租處所租用、計分內外賬房及會客室等、昨日為月底、且屆除夕、故收解較多、不謂竟遭匪徒垂涎、當昨晨十一時二十分許、該經租處、突有男子四名、前往叩問、謊稱意欲租賃雲南路福祥里第二百二十六號房屋、當時外賬房因悉該屋果適空關、認為眞意、乃告以月租須要八十八元、匪等表示太貴、要求抑低、外賬房似有難意、正在磋商間、</p>
<p>內外賬房被劫一空</p>
<p>該四匪卽袖出手槍、喝禁聲張、一匪退至五百零八號門口守望、一匪看守電話、兩匪同時將經租慮諸人、驅諸會客室內、著守望之匪挾槍看守、一面勒令賬房交出銀箱鑰匙、分往內外兩賬房搜刦、外賬房內被刦去鈔洋一千元、意有未滿、當將銀箱打開、內貯鈔洋九百餘一元、續被刦去、但匪心仍不滿足、折入內賬房、打開銀櫃、將內貯鈔洋二千五百餘元、又悉行刦去、總計達四千五百餘元、</p>
<p>茶役報密閽捕鎖門</p>

<p>捕上盜下陝路相逢</p>
<p>適巧斯時有一第二六八號西捕史勒脫、偕一第三三九八號華捕、巡經該處、潘卽上前告警、兩捕得訊、卽囑潘捕前導、奔進景雲大樓、一面囑令電梯司機、將電梯停住下層、不許上行、當卽偕同第三三九八號華捕及司閽捕潘壽龍、由盤梯而上、不防斯時四匪徒、已將搶得鈔洋、藏於一紙帽龍內、退出五零八號見電梯不應、亦正由五樓盤梯而下、已達二樓、兩方卽在底層盤梯轉彎處相遇、</p>
<p>寡不敵衆兩捕被害</p>
<p>匪徒見係探捕、知事外洩、卽開槍射擊、中西捕、以該處一無憑依、乃函退至底層電梯旁暗伏、匪徒情急、竟以亂槍放射、希冀兎脫、中西捕憑險而守、亦三槍齊發、向匪還擊、奈因寡不敵衆、三槍難抵四械、被匪徒逐級竄下、且匪徒四槍、係集中而來、致奮不顧身之西捕史勒脫、及司閽捕潘壽龍、均遭毒手、倒於梯旁、紙剩第三三九八號華捕、單槍對峙、匪徒見捕方槍彈忽疏、知有中傷、</p>
<p>分途協緝截獲兩盜</p>
<p>函趁勢竄下盤梯、逃出大門、向西而逸、第三三九八號華捕、亦卽追出狂吹警笛、到處告警、因此坿近各馬路口、在崗之第三一六五號•二九七五號•及三零八七號華捕等、咸聞訊趕來、分途協緝、一盜當在南京路山東路口、被二九七五號華捕擊倒、一盜在山西路口、被三零八七號華捕生擒、尚有兩盜、仍被逸去、斯時該管捕房、大批中西探員、亦早已趕到、分在各要隘口、嚴密搜查、但兩匪仍無踪跡、</p>
<p>因公殞命將予優卹</p>
<p>一面急令救火會、趕派救護車、分往景雲大樓及山东路口、將受傷中西兩捕、及傷盜一名、分送公濟醫院仁濟醫院救治、奈因受創過重、均在中途身死、西捕史勒脫、彈中頭部、司閽捕傷及腦壳、該死盜身中七槍、抄出原臟一千餘元、手槍一枝、經已存案、兩捕遺體、已送騐屍所、待報中英當局及司法機關請騐、同時捕房方面、因兩捕因公殞命、將予優卹、</p>
<p>子彈紛飛傷及行人</p>
<p>生擒之匪、當卽帶入捕房、並奪下手槍一枝、由捕頭嚴詰之下、承認糾黨行刦、並供出同黨藏匿地點、當由探捕押帶重往領拘、斯案捕匪激戰、雙方發槍不下四五十發、一時子彈紛飛、行人爭避、但尚有兩人被流彈中傷、一為停在附近第八○二三號汽車夫馮阿福、奪波人、年三十歲、傷在右胸、一為包車夫余阿福、傷右臂、亦經捕房車送仁濟醫院救治、尚無十分危險、</p>

<h3>上海霓紅燈製造業（續）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信所主編</p>
<p>［上海工商業概况之四十一）</p>
<p>㊃水銀—各藥房均有出售。</p>
<p>㊄電綫—以橡皮綫為最適用，每圈約一百碼，目前價約十五元左右。本埠電器廠家，均能自製。</p>
<p>㊅鐵壳鐵架—鐵壳用以装置各種製成之字樣及圖案。鐵架於較大之廣告用之。　　除以上各種原料外，油漆亦甚需要。　　其製造程序，首先需測繪構圖，並照需要放大。再以玻璃管照圖折。折玻璃管時需以煤氣（Ｇas卽自來火）將玻璃烘軟，一面折，一面並注入空氣，藉使灣折處保持圓形。折完成後用抽氣機（Pump）將管內空氣抽出，使成眞空。然後視所需顏色，以灌氣機將　氣及水銀同時灌入管內。二端塞以玻璃所製之泡子，該泡端有細銅絲通出，卽用以傳電，名“引電極”。並另以薄同皮固封兩端。再使引電極與變壓器相連，使電流通過變壓器。卽可發光矣。</p>
<p>霓虹燈用電可較普通電燈減省一半。惟製時頗易爆裂，偶一不愼，卽全功盡氣。其優劣除原料之良莠外，工程師之經騐充足與否，氣體配合之是否得當、均大有關係也！</p>
<p>三，各廠現狀</p>
<p>目前本市霓虹燈製造廠共十五家。其中陸續營業者十一家，原係兼製，現已停造者二家，現已停造，而公司尚未解散家，茲分述如下：</p>

<p>㊀東方年紅電光公司—該廠成立於民國十五年夏季，設製造廠於靜安寺路興和里十八號，發行所設於靜安寺路四零七號，係工程界巨子張惠康所發起。原為股份兩合公司組織。股東任士剛陳俊武羅慶蕃錢錢箕傳孫同鈞及張惠康等，資本六萬元。後以業務發達，原有資本不敷分配，乃於民國廿三年添加資本至十二萬元，同時改組為股份有限公司。由任士剛任董事長，常務董事羅慶蕃錢箕傳陳俊武等，董事向俠民孫同鈞陽景吳錦慶等，董事兼經理張惠康。所置機器生財約值二萬餘元。其銷路除本埠外，並擴充至平津京漢等處。</p>
<p>㊁麗安電器公司—該廠成立於民國十八年，係美商額定資本六二四，○○○美元，實牧二一二，○○○美元。初設廠於滬東倍開爾路八十九號，發行所設東百老滙路二六九號，股份有限公司組織，現任董事AMcClure,R.E.Lunkley,M.E.Vittaly,C.M.Campbell.L.　E.　gale　W.　P.　T.Holingsworth及國人郭寶樹君。現任總經理M.E.Vittaly.副經理Miss　Mason，該廠廠址及發行所，現已合併遷於蒲石路亞爾培路口五三四號。其營業亦包括本外埠，主顧以本外埠各外商行家為主，廠內設備頗為完善，通常要用工人約四五十名。去年七月間，該廠發明一種以霓虹管炬製造之格羅蒂爾鐘Glo-Dial　Clock，據云係以霓虹使之發光，裝於各公共場所，相距百碼之外，均可清悉云。（未完）</p>

<h3>中國不亡論（一）</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>在五年以來國難嚴重之中，有不少憂時之士，痛心疾首於國土日蹙强暴橫行的事實，遂由悲觀而絕望，由絕望而消沈，由消沈而自視為等於亡國之民！一年以前，竟有人著為“中國必亡論”的小册子在市場公然出售，這種論調當然合乎自視為亡國之民者的口味，於是不脛而走，爭相傳誦。到了目前，全國和平統一方告實現，抗敵勦匪確有勝利的時候，忽然有張學良在西安叛變，刦持全國唯一領袖的不幸的事實，於是中國恐終必趨於滅亡的心理，更在一部份國人中滋長起來，以為無可救藥了。</p>
<p>實則中國本可以不亡，但使“中國必亡論”的妖言邪說，一旦散布而成為公共的信仰，則中國眞必亡矣，何以故？總理說：“國者人之積也，人者心之器也”中國人旣人人喪失其自信力，自甘暴棄，心目中都自認為劣等民族，應在天然淘汰之列，則中國又何從而不亡？是以欲使中國不亡，應先撲滅中國必亡的邪說，人人樹起中國不亡的自信力來，這是當今建立“心理國防”的一件大事。</p>
<p>古人說：“然敵國外患者，國恒亡；”又說“多難興邦”。我們在這幾年國難之中，從不見中國必亡的徵象，反而發覺建國復興之機已因國難而觸動，再就這次張學良叛變發生後二週之間的全國情勢來觀察，更發見我國實已具備組織近代國家之必要條件。可見古人的名言至理，絕不欺人。此非空言，有事實為證。</p>
<p>第一，中國民衆信仰政府擁護領袖的心理，因為國難當前，才一天天地堅强起來。我們知道，凡是一個國家從顛危衰弱轉到自强復興，一定需要一個很大的團结，這很大的團結又一定需要偉大的領袖；在偉大領袖之下全国團結一致所發生的力量，才是禦侮救亡建国復興的力量。中国民衆在“九一八”後最近五年國難之中澈底覺悟，已經把一種不信仰領袖不崇拜領袖的壞習慣革除了，一變而為信仰領袖服從領袖。此時如再有人發表對於領袖懷疑或批評的言論，凡是有民族意識的青年，絕不上當再來相信了。卽如這一次張學良挾兵叛變，無論其所持何種理由，而卽此刦持全國領袖蔣委員長一點，已鑄成大錯，完全失敗，全國上下，男女老少，無分區域，無分職業，沒有一個不痛恨叛將之喪心病狂，也波有一個不祈求領袖之安全歸來只要看到了十二月二十五日晚間全國國民得知領袖脫險後之歡欣歌舞，就可知民意之所在了。因為大家感覺到德意志意大利蘇俄土耳其等新興國家或復興國家，都是在一個領袖指導之下努力成功，而我們五年間艱苦奮鬥的收獲也是完全在蔣委員長領導之下而得來，這是顯明的事實。我們在國難中受到事實的敎訓，深知分離散漫為亡國之路，團結一致乃復興之道，於是一切立異高論，分歧的行動，不論其如伺天花亂墜，炫耀標榜，皆為全國人心所排斥，决不許其存在於國內的。這一點偉大的成就，可算完全由於敵國外患而來的。現在，如果是服從指揮奮發有為的中國人，就必定有中國絕不會滅亡的自信力，而經過此次西安不幸事變的測驗，全國一致痛責張學良，擁護蔣委員長，更可以堅定我們“中國不亡”的信念！</p>
<p>第二，中國在近十年尤其在國難的五年之中，國家建設有了極大的進步。我作此言，一定有人懷疑着，以為領土被佔，主權被侵，外侮壓迫到如此嚴重的地步，非常事變又隨時可以發生，人民的生命財產常可受着想不到的摧殘，在此情形之下，國家還有甚麼進步可言？但是我仍然要說：中國在這十年中的進步，是千眞萬確，有事實可證的。惟其因為中國建設進步，所以才必然地遭受野心的帝國主義國家的侵略，在侵略者的心中，只希望中國落伍退化永不進步，以便好做他們的次殖民地。故領土被佔，主權被侵，外侮壓迫的嚴重，非常事變的爆發，都是隨着中國求進步的努力而來的必然的反應。可是這種反應只能說新中國或青年中國的“難產”，而終於不能阻上牠的產生。（未完）</p>

<h3>特載</h3>
<p>祁紅之產銷製（四續）</p>
<p>茶價漲落靡定，乃由於對外匯價之變動，前已言之。我國為用銀國家，而紅茶消費國家，以用金國為多。祁紅以輸英最多，故銀元與英鎊間匯兌率之漲落，直接足以影響茶價。近十年來銀價漲落無定，致茶價變動無窮。銀價愈跌，茶價愈漲；反之，銀價愈高，茶價愈跌。祁紅以英銷為主，故市價上落與倫敦匯價有密切之關係，爰據上海物價月刋近十一年來對倫敦匯兌率指數及倒數，立表如左：</p>
<p>近十一年來對倫敦平均匯兌率指數及其倒數表（民國十五年＝一○○）</p>
<p>自前表觀之，民國十五年後，呈金貴銀賤之勢；至民國二十年，達於極點，故對倫敦匯兌率指數，亦自十五年之一○○，跌於二十年之四六·九，換言之，英鎊昂而中幣廉，故在英倫市場之華茶，雖市價相同，然民國二十年倫敦與上海匯價，較十五年跌落一半以上，故茶價亦陡增一倍以上。吾人試觀倫敦匯兌率倒數之首昇降，與茶價幾完全步趨一致，可知匯價與茶價關係之深切矣。</p>
<p>茶價之變動，自難逃供需律之支配，惟近數年來，世界紅茶之供需，早呈生產過剩之趨勢，紅茶價格，一般趨跌，至一九三三年，跌落尤甚。存積過多，於是印錫荷印三主要紅茶國家，為救濟紅茶之刦運，維持茶價起見，同意訂立產銷限制協定，期觀效於五年之內。實行以來。瞬已四載，紅茶存積，雖形稍减，但茶價仍難望提高。華紅茶乃世界紅茶中之一環，市價上落，受國際市價之支配，故祁紅茶之國際市價，近年不致有過度之變動。近年國內市價變遷急劇之原因，實為匯兌所左右也。</p>
<p>自去年十一月四日，政府實行改革幣制以還，匯價穩定，迄今一年，除對法瑞等國，匯價因各該國幣制政策更改外，餘如英美匯率，物能維持不變。故昔日匯價上落影響茶價之痛苦，今後或可不致發生。茶葉市價，全恃供需情形及品質為轉移矣。（未完）</p>

<p>人壽保險兩月刋</p>
<p>— 宋漢章題</p>
<h3>代發刊詞</h3>
<p>— 胡詠騏</p>
<p>人壽保險在我國之前瞻</p>
<p>世態滄桑，人事靡定，故我人負有贍養家庭之義務者，宜未雨調繆，應及早謀安全之保障，以備不測之變故，以及晚景之生活，於是人壽保險遂孕育而出，以應人生之需要焉，夫航輪之保水險，產業之保火險，均屬防患未然，以謀安全之道，然水火不常，人力猶足防禦，且有至終而不罹其、患者，惟人壽有限，死亡安能倖避，體力雖富，病老亦所難免，豈有返老還童起死回生之術乎，由此可知人壽保險之需要，實駕乎水火保險而上之，</p>
<p>先哲有言，百姓足，藏富於民，且外邦經濟專家，亦以人民儲蓄力之大小，卜其國家財源之盛衰，人壽保險者，卽藏富於民之制度也，按最近統計，美國人民之保有壽險者，占百分之六十强，日本人民之保有壽險者，三十人中已有一人，全美人民，平均每人保有壽險金額一千六百餘元，日本人民平均每人保有壽險金額一百元，迥視我國壽險業務，每萬人中，唯一人保有壽險，平均每人保額，亦唯數角而已，以彼度我，相形見拙，誠不能以道里計矣美日兩國人民之保有壽險者旣如是之多，國家建設，農村實業，俱因涓滴保費之彙合，而得充分之開闢，長足之進展，謂予不信，試觀其後，美國都市壽險公司（Ｍetropolitan　Life）擁有有資產總額達三十八萬萬六千七百六十•一萬一十九百十一元三角九分，紐約人壽保險公司（New　York　Life）擁有資產二十萬萬○一千○九十四萬三千一百十二元○二角，查全美壽險公司，共有三百餘家，今就兩公司言，其資產之偉大，則源之豐盛，我國之金融或工商組織，似難相與媲美，日本商營壽險公司，其資產總額達二十一萬萬七千五百萬元，官營簡易人壽保險，其資產總額達七萬萬五千九百八十九萬九千元，官商合計共有資產三十萬萬餘元，按壽險公司所擁之資產，十九俱係所收之保費，卽為被保險人之信託，假手於各該公司以投資於國家之各種最穩健事業也，</p>
<p>竊思國强必先民富，民富方可國强，此乃一定不易之理，人壽保險卽為民富之一法，强國之一途，美日兩國，已為我人之先例，觀乎今日我國雖值內憂外患交迫之秋，惟全國上下，朝氣蓬勃，工商實業，俱呈復蘇之象，農村經濟轉入良好，壽險事業，亦有駸駸日上之勢，以此可知國運步入佳境，民族有待復興，誠可額手相慶也，</p>
<p>人壽保險旣為民富之一法，强國之一途，他日在我國之發展，將與歐美並駕而齊驅，第以壽險事業在我國之歷史，尚為膚淺，一般對之，大都漠無所知，此無他，要皆缺乏敎育之事工，本公會與中國保險學會，刻正加以努力，爰就此項事工之犖犖大者，列陳於後，</p>
<p>（一）呈請敎部將保險學識列入小學敎材鄙人前膺本公會之命，代表晉京，向敎部請願將保險敎材，援照日本先例編入小學及民衆敎育敎科書內，承蒙該部，加以首肯，允為轉飭各書局輯入，母任欣幸，</p>
<p>（二）請各大學商科以人壽保險列入必修學程人壽保險為經濟學識之一，歐美日本各大學之商業學院，已將人壽保險次第列入必修學程，如美國邊雪文尼大學UniofPennsy　Ivenia紐約大學New　York　University者，更設立人壽保險專修一科，其重要當可見一斑，我國各大學商學院，雖已將人壽保險列入敎材，第以未經規定為必修，前經本公會會同中國保險學會致函各大學，請將人壽保險列入商科學生必修學程，以資倡導，</p>
<p>（三）在日報舉行宣導本會為普及一般對於壽險之認識起見，爰於申報舉行聯合宣導事工，除刋登敎育意義之廣告外，並特輯本刋，以廣傳佈，俾國人對於人壽保險，曉然於懷，同享身家保障之樂也，</p>
<p>（四）提高從業員之程度人壽保險，使人以適當經濟之能力，謀身家幸福之保障，以故壽險從業員，無異家庭間之經濟顧問，備為大衆之商詢，倘從業員本身，劉於壽險認識，頗為菲薄，奚克受此重任，以故壽險從業員，應先有充分之訓練，豐裕之學識，方可無負使命，本公會與中國保險學會，現正籌設流通圖書館，以供從業人員之研究，</p>
<p>總之，我人之敎育事工，不尚虛談，本其事實，使人人心中俱知人壽保險為衣食住行以外之必需條件，而認識投保壽險為個人之一種責任云爾，</p>
<p>人壽保險在我國之園地，異常寬曠，如經適當之敎育事工，定能驀然發展，而我華商同業，尤為國人所愛護，自在意想之中，蓋就二十年來華商各親行之備受國人歡迎，足為我人對於本業奮興之一點，鄙人甚願與同業及研究保險學諸君，互助規勉，貫澈此項重大之使命，不負國人之重寄，庶幾壽險事業，成為國內有力之金融機關，同臻美國現有之盛况，是則身家幸福之保障，國家建設之興進，實多利賴焉，</p>
<h3>人壽保險析義</h3>
<p>— 郭佩弦</p>
<p>人壽保險是什麼？</p>
<p>美國經濟學家威勒氏（AllanH.Willet)說：“人壽保險可把衆人的危險轉移於一個人或一羣人，是一種積聚資金以預防無定的夭亡損失的社會方策。”</p>
<p>美國保險學泰斗許本納氏（S.S.Huebner)說：“自個人的立場來說，人壽保險是一種契約，由被保險人出納保費，倘若它死亡或遭遇別的指定事件，由保險人賠償它或它的受益人一定的保險金額。”</p>
<p>日本著名學者津村秀松說：“葆險是一羣慮有同類危險的人，聯合來分擔其間所生的損失。”</p>
<p>以上所舉幾個定義，措詞雖各不同，意義本無二致。簡而言之，所謂人壽保險，就是將個人的生命危險轉嫁於一羣人，使每人負擔一個小小的保費損失，而不致負担重大生命损失的一種科學方法。</p>
<p>依保險術語，凡以其身之生死為保險標的者，呌做被保險人，與保險人訂立保險契約者，呌做要保人，享受契的利益者，呌做受益人。人壽保險是由要保人繳納保險費，倘遇被保險人死亡或保險事故發生，即由保險人賠償要保人，或它所指定的受益人以保險金額的雙務有償契約。</p>
<p>依據上述的定義而分析，我們可見人壽保險的內含，有左列的基本要義：</p>
<p>（一）危險的無定危險二字本來是個抽象的名詞，而保險界則常用以指保險的實物，如生命，房屋，船舶，貨物等是。人壽保險所保的生命危險須為無定的。所謂無定者，就是危險的發生不能預定，發生的原因并不是出於自動。例如串同諾害被保險人的生命，圖諾領取保險金，卽是預定的危險，保險人不負賠償責任：又如被保險人蓄意自殺，卽是出於自動的危險，非巴保險三年以上，保險人也多不負賠償責任。</p>
<p>（二）危險的類聚人壽保險所保的危險，須屬於同一種類（Homog　enous），就是被保險人的年齡體格須要大概相同，因為保費計算，是以危險程度為比例，而危險程度的測度，又以被保險人的年齡及體格為準繩。老年的人與青年的人，體健的人與體弱的人，危險程度高下不齊，必須分別老幼强弱，計算保費纔有準則。故保險公司對於年事太高的人們，或謝絕不保，或增收保費，或縮短保期；對於被保險人，須先檢驗體格，若果身細尫弱，卽列為次健的危險（sub-standdard，）非特加保費而不承保，或約定把保險金折減陪（Risk）。</p>
<p>（三）危險的轉移宇宙間的事事物物，林林總總，個別觀察，都好像變幻莫測，不可究詰。可是我倒若果延長觀察的時間，擴太觀察的範疇，往往從紛亂中，可以發見定律。人壽保險所保的不是個人，而是個人的集團；不是個人的單獨損失，而是全體的平均損失。個人的死亡是偶然的，集體中個人的死亡不是偶然的，雖其中有先死後死的遲早，可是平均計算，死亡的人數是很有定的。但必定要被保險人很多，纔能適中平均律，以推測危險發生的次數。同年齡的人，在一年中，平均有多少人死亡，已經統計學者根據經騐編成統計表。卽如我國一般壽險公司習用的美國經騐死亡表，就載有從十歲起至九十五歲止的經騐死亡率。保險公司根據死亡表就可預先算定每年須付出賠欵多少，同時應向每人收取保費多少，才可抵償死亡者的損失。這麼一來，便可以有定的保費損失，替代無定的死亡損失了。</p>
<p>（四）保費的確定人壽保險所收的保費，除定期保險外，到了保險滿期或被保險人身故，終須返還被保險人或受益人。所以壽險公司有預積資金，以備賠償損失的必要。準備金的積存愈充足，被保險人保障愈穩固。至準備金的積存，須依照法律的規定和科學的方法。準備金就是從保費而來的，保險費的徵收，不獨要按年齡而有差別，而且須依保險單的種類及附帶條件而不同。現今壽險公司所收的保費，大都均平分配於保險期間，就是從初保這幾年起，就收取一種平均保費，多過當時所需要來賠償損失及支付費用的，以積存一宗準備金，為後來死亡激增入不敷出那幾年的準備。</p>
<p>基於以上分析，我們當認識壽人保險的眞義，不是保長生不死，而是保生產能力的損失。許本納氏說：“人壽保險是生命價值資本化及其賠償的唯一方法。”換旬話說，人壽保險可廷長不幸者的生產能力，使它去世後仍有資本價值，以維持依賴者的生活。保了壽險的家庭，家主雖然死亡，家庭收入仍然不變，家人仍可如常過活，不致凍餒而轉乎溝壑。倘若身後沒有保險，也沒有什麼積蓄，一旦生利的人逝世，家人就難免淪入悲慘之境。</p>
<p>人壽保險的基本意義，就是在生命危險負担的分散，與生產能力損失的抵償。它可把人生無定的危化為有定，以使吾人生活安定，身心舒泰，生不虞困乏，死不愁瞻養，實在是保障身家性命的唯一善法。所以，凡有家庭責任的人們，都應當投保壽險，以為家庭幸福的保障。</p>

<h3>銀行職員的妻須勸其夫保壽之我見</h3>
<p>— 譚雲珊</p>
<p>因受環境段階不同的影響而發生人類中男男女女的思想和行為的分異。男子大都在三十歲以上方才有比較榷定的思想和行為。女子却比較早一點。大都在廿四以上的年齡。已有很榷定的思想和行為。因此。從古以來男子對於女子。都有一種“內助”的認識。假定一個很浪漫的男子。如果得到一個有好的思想和行為的女人做妻子的。也許她能够糾正她的丈夫的思想和行為。這種認識是曾經過全大陸上的人類很長期的共同承認。現代的思想對於“內助”的一個名詞。似乎感覺到鯁喉一點。尤其是年青的女子却常站在反對的最前線。其實這均是一點小小的錯誤。沒認識人類生活的段階—優生學的意義。人類生活的段階絕對不是像現代半藝術的浪漫化和自殺化。人類生活的段階乃是絕對的謀一個家庭達到眞美善的幸福。欲謀一個家庭能達到眞美善的幸福。須具一種保障經濟的方策。關於保障經濟的方策不下千萬。但“人壽保險”却是第一條上策。這條方策尤其對於银行職員更比較適宜切要。因為。</p>
<p>（一）銀行職員每日因服務而檢點鈔票銀幣的數目總較別種商業的職員的數目為多。則指掌沾染不潔的積蹟亦愈多。銀行每日來往鈔票銀幣數以千萬計。該項鈔票銀幣往往粘附黴菌。此種黴菌。就是傳染疾病的媒介。銀行職員雖然時常用清水洗擦指掌。但據中外名醫的研究。不少黴菌。絕對不是用冷水浸洗卽可消滅。須經沸水浸洗若干時。或用消毒藥水搓擦。方能殺其生命。銀行職員的指掌與鈔票銀幣接觸的機會愈多。則沾染黴菌亦愈多。偶一不愼。手拈食品。黴菌附帶入於腸胃。隨時有滋長的可能。假定對於指掌特別防備。不使沾染黴菌傳入臟腑。但銀行職員出納鈔票銀幣。必須逐一檢點數目。俯察眞偽。因此。口鼻眼與鈔票銀幣距離至近。往往被患有傳染病的人所持過而附有黴菌的鈔票銀幣接觸斯傳染。這是何等危險。銀行職員絕對不能終旦裏以口罩而工作。倘不裹以口罩。則每每於檢點鈔票銀幣的時候。或因口鼻呼吸而被黴菌侵入。故銀行職員的生命。恒較常人為恐怖而短促。</p>
<p>（二）銀行職員對於擔住管理來往賬目錢銀鈔票支票滙票的工作。比較普通商業的職員更為繁重。絲毫不能疏忽。否則往往因為一時疏忽而致損失鉅大。所以耗去的精神和心血亦較普通商店的職員為多。銀行的事務旣是極勞心血費精神的。那末。銀行的職員亦比較容易患貧血的病症。</p>
<p>（三）銀行職員因環境比較的充裕。往往縱情聲色。置家庭責任於腦後。或因經營授機事業。一旦失敗。財盡名裂。往往演成自殺的慘劇。</p>
<p>（四）銀行職員因為受銀行秩序的拘禁。他們的常識。往往祇限於銀行的範圍。一旦倘失業。在未得機會重入銀行服務以前。匪特其本人感受失業痛苦的滋味。尤其因失業而影響家庭經濟的破產。</p>
<p>上述種種。均自銀行職員最重要的特點。銀行職員對此應知早一日覺悟趨向“人壽保險”的一條生路。可是浪漫是男子的天性。尤其是一般淵飽的銀行職員。因此。我很希望銀行職員的賢“內助”能够時時刻刻的指導她的丈夫獲得“人壽保險”的保障。</p>
<h3>消息</h3>
<p>上海市保險業同業公會為謀普及保險知識及養育保險學人才起見，曾呈請敎育部領令各大書局編訂保險敎材於小學敎科書之內，並致函各大學及專門學校設備保險學科，茲將呈文及專函錄後。</p>
<p>（一）呈敎育部文</p>
<p>呈為再請通令各大書局將保險一課訂入小學敎科書內，俾保險知識得以廣為灌輸，藉障民生而維儉德，仰祈鑒核施行事。竊查保險之為用，乃在集羣衆所得千一之資，以防個人發生萬一之患，疾病老死，誰屬能逃，水火天災，何地蔑有？苟有保險之設施，則個人身家財產，旣可得其相當保障，而社會之富財，復可得以增殖流通。由是以觀，保險事業，對於培養儉德，保障民生，發展富財，安定社會，實有無窮助力。竊考歐美各國敎育當局訓練青年，對於灌輸保險知識與提倡儲蓄運動，同一注重，其用意所及，至為顯然。近者日本文部省，亦以保險一課，訂入小學敎科書內，意亦欲將此優良知識，普及於青年腦海中，使其對於民生之發展，儉德之養成，能事半功培，不落歐美各國之後耳。最近蔣委員長頒佈新生活運動勞働服務團組織大綱中，特規定第十五項為提倡儲蓄保險運動，其重視保險之意，良足多者。我國年來民生凋敝習尚奢靡，敎育方針，方以發展民生，提倡儉德以為救濟。茲查保險事業，與此敎育方針正相符合，允宜將保險思想，向青年學子，廣為灌輸，以收實效。敝會前曾以一得之見，奉呈鈞部，請通令各大書局將保險一課訂入小學敎科書內，未奉批示在案。茲悉各書局小學敎科書，現正奉令修訂，用特專派胡詠騏君賷文呈請鈞部，伏乞准如所請，通令各大書書將保險一課訂入小學敎科書內，俾保險知議得以廣為灌輸，藉障民生，而維儉德，實為公便。謹呈敎育部長王</p>

<p>電信特栞</p>
<h3>二十六年元旦獻辭</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>去年元旦，作者在本刊著“電信界之新希望”一文，以電信界之立場，對於國家對於社會兩方面，均抱無限之希望。時光迅速，轉瞬已有一年矣。在此一年中，吾人之新希望，事實上均已達到：如鞏固世界和平也，國內政局安定也，國家經濟發達也，政軍當局維持電信也，社會人士通力合作也，企業家組織電料工廠也，在在均與電信事業有莫大之關係，而為吾人日夜企禱者也。今年元旦，吾人除希望去年所得之希望，應加保持，並發揚光大外，對於國家對於事業，更有下列數點，為今年之希望與努力之目標：</p>
<p>甲•對於國家方面</p>
<p>㊀鞏固中央政權自兩廣問題解决後，中央政權，已告統一，國際地位，提高不少。惟中央主管事項與各省主管事項，苟有重複或衝突之處，自應依照中央法令，予以解决，以免重複建設與零星建設之弊。苟中央政權，不加鞏固，则省自為政，人自為功，平時有浪費人力財力之虞，戰時有互相牽制推諉之害，指揮不一，度調不靈，禦侮圖存，自難收指臂之效。各省政府所辦之長途電話，在今年內，應歸交通部主辦，卽其一例。</p>
<p>㊁擁護最高領袖蔣委員長豐功偉烈，一身繫天下安危，吾人應當擁護，自無疑義。惟擁護之道，應以事實表現，不當徒尚空言。我電界同人，對於委員長所發之電報，無不以妥愼迅速之手段處理之，事實上已盡擁護之能事。猶憶去年十月，各方所發祝壽之電，如雪片飛來，各局同人加班工作，踴躍從事。卽此次西安事變，關於營救委員長之電報，在綫路阻斷之時，谷局均能儘量設法拍發，使委員長安然脫險，此雖係吾人職責所在，無可旁貸，要皆受領袖精神感召不辭勞怨以赴之使然耳。今後吾同人當益加奮發，為國努力。</p>
<p>乙•關於事業方面</p>
<p>㊀發展國際電報自國際電台成立，先後與各國訂定直達電路後，國際電報之利權，挽回大半。惟尚有少數國人，仍不知國際電台通信效率之優良與維持業務之周到者。自今日起，希望全國人士，凡拍發往國外之電報，皆於附註欄內加註Via　Cgra字樣，在個人不過舉手一揮之事，在國家獲得收回發電之權。換言之多發一張Via　Cgra之電報，多增加國力一分也。</p>
<p>㊁普遍電報利用電報利用之利益，不勝枚舉，年關關頭，尤為通信利器。交通部為便利民衆起見，年來對於電報業務之整頓，不遺餘力。而國內電報收費價目，屢次减低，且自去年九月起，本省電報，减低百分之三十計費，實係電政經濟上最大之犧性。希望全國人士，對於電政當局改進之精神，予以贊助，一致利用電報，作為通信工具，則現代國民之風度，當之無愧矣。</p>
<p>㊂完成長途電話網交通部主辦之長途電話，去年大有顯著之進步，通話處所，較之二十四年，增加百零四處，通話次數，較之二十二年，增加七七，七七五次，綫路增加一八，○一三公里，綫條增加三七，五三一公里。惟以各路設裝工程，尚待繼續進行，各地增音站，尚未裝設完竣，故全國通話，未經開放。希望今年，吾人下最大之决心與努力，將上項工程，於最短期間完成之，則我國各處息息相通，聲氣相應，對於政治軍事經濟文化各方面之貢獻，固不大耶？</p>
<p>以上所陳，係吾人新年最低限度之希望。吾人不尚空談，亦不涉幻想，惟有在主管長官指導與社會人士督促之下，埋頭苦幹，以盡吾人對於國家與事業之天戰。語云：“夫助自助，”又曰：“人定勝天，”謹以此語，為今年元旦獻歲之辭。</p>
<h3>結帳期間之電報用途</h3>
<p>歲月不居，轉瞬將屆商業結帳之期。各商行如與外埠同業或其他商號有帳欵往來者，自必先期將帳單寄至對方，以資接洽。但路途較遠者，郵遞頗費時日，往往緩不濟念。蓋結帳期間各商行料理欠人人欠各項賬目，在在需欵孔殷，不得不採用最迅速之通信方法，向外埠有關商行催收帳欵。拍發電報為今日最迅速簡便之通信方法，尤以在商業結帳期間能充分發揮其功效，茲試述其用途如次：</p>
<p>一，電報催賬拍發電報旣為最迅速之通信方法，所有各商行發寄各地之商業電報，不論經由有綫電或無綫電傳遞，均可隨發隨到，無遠弗屆。各商行如用電報向外埠有關商行催收帳欵，無論為期如何急促，轉瞬卽可送達對方，異常迅速簡便。例如“天律元緯路益大綢莊：尊帳本節結欠（三五六二）元速匯緯成廠銑”一電，由電局送達收報商號後，該商號如查核來電所開帳欵數目確係相符，當可立卽將帳欵匯出。卽使為期已甚迫近，普通匯欵因郵函遞寄需時，無法趕到。倘將帳欵交由銀行或郵政儲金匯業局電匯，則當日卽可匯到。可見各商號利用電報催收帳欵，實有意想不到之效力也。上項電報催收帳欵辦法，歐美各國商家早已實行，卓著成效。我國各大商行儘可仿效試用，以免發寄帳單郵遞需時，緩不濟急也。</p>
<p>二，電匯帳欵各商號接到外埠商號寄來之帳單後，如將帳欵交由銀行匯寄，預計時日，已不及在結帳期前匯到者，為力求迅速起見，可將帳欵交由銀行或郵政儲金匯業局電匯，不論距離如何窎遠，均能隨發隨到，異常迅捷便利。對方商行收到帳欵後，對於該商行電匯帳欵之迅速，自必發生良好印象，故各地商行際此結帳期間，如用電報匯寄帳欵，旣屬迅速便利，復可藉此增進商業信用，足見電報在商業上之用途，殊為廣大也。</p>
<p>三，利用電報收據辦法各電局最近實行之寄還電報收據辦法，對於有關帳務之電報，亦有相當功用。蓋各商行拍發催收帳欵電報時，如在電底內加註“回據”標識，則該項電報一經收報電局送妥，電局須將曾經收報人簽名或蓋章之“收到電報回據”，送還發寄該電之商號收執。發報商號接到該項回據後，當可確知本號所發電報，業經收報商號簽收無誤，並能預計收報商號方面所匯帳欵，大約何時可以匯到。又各商行如在電匯帳欵電報內註明“回據標識”則該電送達收報人後，電局須將曾經收報人簽名或蓋章之“收到電報回據”派差送還。發寄該項電報之商行，可將該項業經收報商行簽名或蓋章之“收到電報回據”作為收到帳欵之憑證，列帳時如無正式收據，卽以該項“收到電報回據”附入帳册，亦無不可，此電報在結帳期間之又一用途也。</p>
<p>四，利用電報查帳個人或商號接得外埠商行寄來之帳單如經查明與本人或本號帳册上所列數目不同，自宜先行查詢清楚，以便結算。但各商行發寄帳單，住往在節關前數日，故帳單寄到後，如發覺帳欵數目有不符之處，路途較遠者，必無充分時間可以去函查詢。倘利用電報，則無論為時如何短促，尚可往返查詢，於短時期內可將帳欵數目互相校對明白，殊為迅捷便利。</p>
<p>五，電催期欵押欵借欵各商行在結帳期間，如查有外埠往來商行應付未付之到期欵項，自須設法催收，以清帳目。最迅捷之催收方法，惟有利用電報。又各銀行錢莊等對於外埠到期押欵借欵，際此結帳期間，如用電報催收，或尚龍於節關以前收齊。否則函牘往返，時間恐已不及矣。</p>
<p>六，電催出期貨欵各商行如有外埠商號訂購之期貨，到期尚未付欵出貨者，在結帳期間，亦宜設法催促對方，以免拖延。欲求迅速有效之催促方法，惟有採用電報。倘對方商行接到電報後，立卽前來付欵出貨，則在結帳期間多此一筆貨欵，以資周轉，亦不無裨益金融。</p>
<p>總之，電報在商業結帳期間之用途甚多，不僅上述諸端而已。各商行際茲商業結帳期間，如能儘量利用電報，使其充分發揮功能，裨益商業，當非淺鮮。幸各商行注意焉。</p>
<h3>交通部國內長途電話之兩種新辦法</h3>
<p>— 溥沾</p>
<p>新年之新貢獻</p>
<p>一•市內電話用戶，其所裝電話機，業已向電局登記繳納長途電話保證金（或曾填具接通長途電話聲請書），而須借用另一未經登記之話機（不論是否屬於該用戶），傳發長途電話，並請將該次長途話費，記在其業已登記之話機話費賬上繳付者，電局亦可照辦；但是項借用話機，以與該用戶已登記之話機，在同一市內電話營業區域以內者為限。茲規定其掛號手續如左：</p>
<p>（甲）市內電話用戶惜機發話事前以書面向電局聲請者：發話人應以業經登記傳發途電話之用戶名義，用書面開具其已經登記之電話號碼，所擬借用傳發長途電話之另一電話號碼，及借機發話人之姓名，向電局聲請凡指定之發話人借用該另一電話傳發長途電話之話費列入其登記話機話費賬上繳付，經電局書面許可後，卽可由指定之發話人依國內長途電話營業通則第十一條所定各類通話掛號手續，在該另一電話機上，借發長途電話，惟於掛號時應特別聲明係借機發話，話費應記於某某用戶何號電話賬上，及其本人姓名，以便電局照辦。</p>
<p>（乙）市內電話用戶臨時借機發話，事前未以書面向電局聲請者：</p>
<p>㊀發話人應先就其借用之話機，通知其業已登記之電話處所，告以擬借用某號電話傳發長途電話至某處，並囑其等候，俟電局來電話查詢時，應承認願付此項通話費；</p>
<p>㊁發話人就其所借用之話機，依國內長途電話營業通則第十一絛所定各類通話掛號手續，向電局掛號，並告以所借之電話號碼，請將通話費記在某號電話賬上繳付，並聲明已通知某號電話處所知照矣；</p>
<p>㊂電局於發話人掛號後，卽呼呌該發話人指定付費之電話，詢以現有某某人在某號話機上，欲傳發長途電話至某處，願否將應付之通話費，記於其賬上，如經認可，電局卽為接通長途電話至發話人所借話機，而將其通話費記於其指定付費之電話賬上。（未完）</p>
<h3>長途電話之銷號問題（續）</h3>
<p>— 炯</p>
<p>又受話用戶雖經受話電局呌到而受話電局因綫路或機器驟然發生障礙，不能回呌發話電局轉接發話用戶時，發話人亦可聲請免費銷號。</p>
<p>（乙）不需要重複通話發話人向電局聲請掛號，欲與某地某人或某地某號電話通話後，適接該受話人發來電話，先行通話，以致事業上並不需要再與該受話人通話者，照章可向電局聲請免費銷號。</p>
<p>（丙）守候過久發話人向電局掛號後，因綫路擁塞話務繁忙，以致尋常通話守候至二小時，加急通話守候至一小時，尚未能與對方通話，而請求銷號者，電局均可免收銷號費。又傳呼通話已由受話電局派差前往傳呼者，亦仍照章收取銷號費，發話人因故不欲通話請求銷號者仍應照收銷號費但在上述規定守候時間以內。</p>
<p>上述各項未能通話情形，旣因機綫發生障礙或綫路擁塞話務繁忙所致，故發話人均可請求免費銷號也。</p>
<p>至某地與某地間之銷號費，不論何種通話，均歸一律。其計算方法，以話費數目偽根據。按照新訂國內長途電話分類價目對照表（此項對照表及交通部國內長途電話營業通則，均可向當地電局索閱）之規定，尋常呌號通話話費自一角至五角，均收銷號費一角；話費自六角至一元，均收銷號費二角；話費自一元一角至一元五角，均收銷號費三角。餘依此類推。例如南京至蘇州尋常呌號通話每次收費九角，則銷號費應收二角。（完）</p>

<h3>世界和平與中國</h3>
<p>— 俞頌華</p>
<p>民國二十五年已於昨日過去，二十六年新年方從今日開始。當此歲序更新之始，吾人觀察世界情况以及中國之處境，對於舉世所關心之世界和平問題，不能不先予相當之注意。</p>
<p>一九三六年戰爭危機之預言，東隣報章雜誌早於九一八事變以來，屢屢警告。去年一年中，東西歐果有遷延半載之西班牙戰爭，在東方亦有轟轟烈烈之綏遠戰事。差堪幸者，大規模之國際戰爭大屠殺未曾爆發耳。</p>
<p>大規模之國際戰爭雖未作於去年，而大戰之危機初未隨舊年而俱去。他姑不論，卽如意德日三國之勾結，與夫中日問題，糾結甚多，而不易解决，實已足以增加世界之危機。彼抱侵略主義之國家，別有企圖，大有非使全世界捲入大戰漩渦，不足以饜其慾望之概。列國軍事預算之增加，軍備之積極擴張，卽其明證。幸賴世之愛好和平者，對於和平之推進，鍥而不舍，以期挽回世界之浩劫，是以人類之空前戰禍，尚未爆發於一旦。就其發展之情勢觀之，侵略勢力與和平勢力之消長，殆將决於今年一年之中。此客觀情勢所昭示，亦關心世界和平問題者所惴惴不安者也。</p>
<p>中國處此國際環境中，欲救亡圖存，對內惟有努力於和平之建設，以充裕國家之實力，對外惟有抱不惜大犧牲之决心，對付侵略勢力之來臨。此種認識，目下已成國人共同之認識。去年兩廣事件與最近西安事變，悉告和平解决。綏戰發動以來，前綫將士，奮勇苦鬥，各地人民又一致熱烈援助。全國上下，對於救亡圖存正確之步驟，若無深切之覺悟與認識，曷克臻此！此實中國之一大進步。今後果能循此進行，中國前途，自有漸入佳境之可能。然國際風雲，變化莫測，外力加於中國之壓迫，又日深一日，中國目前之環境，艱險萬狀，稍一不愼，覆亡之禍，可以立待，亦屬事實之無可諱言者。故戰戰兢兢，如履薄冰，實國人應取之態度，而努力奮鬥，以戰勝困難艱險之環境，亦國人應盡之責任。記者於此，敢貢三端，以為蒭蕘之獻。</p>
<p>一曰就本位努力昔顧亭林有言：“天下興亡，匹夫有責。”良以愛國救國，端賴人人努力。目前中國之救亡圖存，亦首在人人各就其本位，克盡厥責，為社會為國家，發揮其有益之力量。誠能每一個人，每一件工作，悉盡其分工合作之能事，綜合以成偉大之力量，則國難未始不可解，中國自由與平等之鵠的，亦未始不能由此而逐漸達到。此本位努力之所以未可忽視也。</p>
<p>二曰非常時期之準備一切生活，一切習慣，非常時與平時均逈乎不同。設在平時漫無非常時之準備，臨時卽難免有倉皇失措之虞。我中國我中華民族之能否於非常時中轉禍為福，化險為夷，卽視我人平時有無非常時之準備為斷。抑有進者，平時與非常時亦非截然可分，平時泄泄，往往卽為禍生倉卒之根，只有以平時作非常時看，時時警惕處處奮勉，然後非常時期之來臨，可以處之泰然，應付裕如也。</p>
<p>三曰集中意志與力量一致對外年來國人對於和平建設之重要，已有深切之認識。故中國今後和平建設之最大障碍實不在內部，而在外力之壓迫。苟能解除此壓迫，和平建設之進步，必有一日千里之勢，殆可斷言。然而解除此壓迫，却亦並非易事。非集中全國之意志與力量於此一點，决難奏功。敵人深忌中國統一，而常取分化與各個擊破之方策對付中國，其目的無非在破壞我全國一致之對外力量。於此足見欲求中國能從外力壓迫中解放出來，集中意志與力量，一致對外實屬最為有效之方策。</p>
<p>救國原應從多方面着力，而上述三端，亦僅屬抽象的原則。不過不言救國則已，誠欲本努力以達救國之鵠的，則竊謂此三端者，實為吾人努力之準繩，而循此以求種種具體事實之發展，則國家與個人，必有光明之出路。救國原非異人任，惟在衆人向正確之目標，羣策羣力，一致前進。語云：“一年之計在於春；一日之計在於寅；”茲當歲首，竊願以“依此三端，加倍努力”之旨，與國人共勉焉。</p>
<h3>一年來的中國</h3>
<p>— 起</p>
<p>民國二十五年，已經在驚濤惡浪中過去了。回首這一年中發生的事情，眞有些令人眼花撩亂，本文想就中舉其犖犖大端，作一客觀的敘述，以備吾國人在這歲端前瞻後顧的參考。</p>
<p>在這過去的一年中，第一可以注意的自然莫過於中日的外交與華北的局勢。與華北局勢的推移有着很大關係的便是綏遠的戰事。吾們要檢討中國過去的一年，自然要注視上述兩件大事的演變，可是吾們底目光也不應太偏，吾們還該明白國內其他重要的發展，舉其主要的事項來說，例如政治經濟，與建設方面的興革，兩廣事件與去年歲暮發生的西安事變，這些事與中日外交，華北局勢及綏遠戰事都有着絕對不可分解的聯繋，本文為了行文便利，只能提綱挈領地述說，還希望讀者整個地，全面地把捉這一年來的變遷，從聯繫中窺測出各個問題的消長來。</p>
<p>㊀中日外交與華北局勢</p>
<p>這一年來的中日外交，勉强可以劃分成兩個時期，中間以原任日本駐華大使有田返國改任外相作分水綫。這並不是說，有田的担任外相日本的對華政策有什麼原則上重大的變更；只是自有田就任外相後，中日雙方都有努力於整個調整兩國關係的傾向，却是顯著的事實。</p>
<p>日本對華外交方針，始終以廣田三原則為根據。所謂三原則是：㊀中國應清算抗日態度，眞正努力東亞和平，如此則日本準備援助中國，以謀東亞的安定；㊁改善以華北為中心的中，日，“滿”關係；㊂防止東亞和平重大障碍的赤化運動。去年一月二十一日日本議會開會時廣田之演說，卸任日本駐華大使有吉明二月十二日回國之報告以及有田繼任駐華大使時所發表的外交政策中，都念念不忘於所謂三原則的實施。卽在有田改任外相後，據去年四月十四日華聯社所發表的消息，有田所主張的外交工作集中在“擴大冀察政權，以為建立‘華北國’的準備”，“從經濟上促成中國承認偽‘滿’，並使之結成所謂中日‘滿’一體的經濟關係”及“以共同防共為名，實現上項目的”三點，也還是廣田三原則的換形。</p>
<p>自有田於去年二月底來華就任駐華大使至三月底返國的短短一月中，中日關係較前活躍多多。三月中旬有田與我國外交部長張羣曾舉行外交談判四次，談判的內容，如四次談判後中日雙方共同發表的公告上所說，“舉凡關係兩國之問題均經研討”，其結果則“雙方見解雖未能全部一致，但可認為有裨於彼此意思之疏通匪鮮”。由此可知，這幾次談話雖未得决截的結論，但已可看作後來中日作整個調整關係談判的準備。</p>
<p>自有田返國後，中日的關係，因華北局部之呈現不安狀態，很形暗淡，一直至七月間才略見活潑起來。二中全會中我外交部長張羣外交報告裏誠懇倡議中日兩國間應由外交途徑，圖謀整個關係的調整，發其嚆矢，其後七月十七日日外相有田也發表贊同中日兩國應作基本調整的談話。這樣，中日關係，一時頗有活潑之氣象。跟着雙方這樣表示出現的使是八月下旬日本駐華大使川樾赴津後召開的外，陸，海三省高級幹部會議，商决得一具體的結果，作為中日雙方作全面談判的預備。</p>
<p>在中日關係基本調整的呼聲中，接連發生了成都，北海，汕頭，漢口，上海等處傷害日僑的事件，使雙方的糾紛轉甚，一時情勢，頗形緊張。九月十三日，日大使川樾由滬赴京，與我張外長對中日間一切問題，開始作正面的折衝。自九月十五日至二十三日，川樾三次訪晤張外長商談，因彼此所見相距很遠，並無什麼結果。因上海虹口日兵遇害事件猝發。日方空氣突有露骨之轉向。談判遂陷於停頓的狀態中。日本方面，經三省協議打開僵局辦法後，派遣廣田三原則的起草人東亞局長桑島携帶日的最後方案來華，訓令川越交涉，據談日本不欲立卽解决全部懸案，僅欲迅速解决對於日本利益最有關係的重要問題。此後局勢緩和下來。停頓多時的中日交涉又自十月十九日起重行復議。在第五，六，七三次張外長，川越會談中，討論的主題集中在華北特殊化與共同防共兩項，雖沒有决截的結果，總算還在正常的外交途軌中，覓取合理解决辦法的可能。不幸，綏遠方面，偽匪等雜軍，受人唆使，向我方進攻。在這樣情勢下，外交談判自難順利進行，至十二月五日，張川的會談終於不能賡續。日大使川越乃離京赴滬，只留日總領事須磨與我外交部亞洲司司長高宗武側面的折衝。西安事變發生後八日（十二日二十日）滯留滬濱的川越又翩然進京，大概又有“相機行事”之意。</p>
<p>至於華北情勢的推展，粗粗可分為三個時期：第一時期以冀東，察北問題的談判為重心，第二時期以走私問題與“協力防共”問題為重心，第三以“中日經濟提携”問題為重心。</p>
<p>華北的局勢，以民國念四年十一月殷汝耕宣佈“自治”，組織所謂“冀東二十二縣自治委員會”時為最緊急。十二月八日冀察政委會成立，華北的燃眉之急總算得以略解。正在我三十二軍商震部撤退的時候，“冀東自治委員會”趙雷部乘機將塘沽，大沽佔據；同時偽“滿”軍隊李守信部與蒙古保安隊亦將察北的沽源，商都，康保，張北，寶昌，萬全等六縣佔領。冀東的偽組織存在一天，華北便一日不得安；察北六縣被佔領一天，綏省便受一天的威脅。而且，日方底目標决不卽此而止，原想以冀，魯，晋，察，綏五省建立所謂“華北五省自治”的傀儡政權，嗾使殷汝耕成立所謂冀東偽自治政府便是這樣企圖的基礎。冀察當局未嘗不了然於這樣的危機，因此宋哲元自就任冀察政委會的委員長以後，卽與日方磋商解决這兩問題。但以日方態度之閃爍不定，而且時而由日駐津軍司令多田出面交涉，時而由關東軍特務機關長士肥原負責折衝，這個答應了那個不承認，那個答應了這個又不表首肯，終於一無所成。</p>
<p>華北之另一嚴重事態是走私的猖獗。去年一、二、三月中，私運入口的貨物，總值至少在一萬萬左右，連同前年私運貨物的二萬一千萬元，共值三萬萬元，幾佔我國總輸入值百分之三十强，這眞是可怕的鉅數。後來走私之風由華北蔓延及華中與華南，撼動了中國整個民族工業浮弱的基礎。我政府為救濟這樣可怕的經濟大出血症起見，在五月下旬曾先後頒佈了懲治偷漏關稅暫行條例，防止鐵路走私施行細則及稽查進口貨物運銷辦法，但因某方以種種方法支持這走私惡風，縱然政府一再頒佈取締的辦法，也還是無法實行。</p>
<p>防共本是所謂廣田三原則之一，因此自共軍竄入山西以後，日方卽藉口作種種的無理要求。其實防共純粹是一國的內政舉措，而且冀察當局早已防範得無微不至，日方還是糾纏不清地提出“協力防共”的要求。五月間駐津日軍參謀長永見一再向冀察當局提出“協力防共”的建議，而且認為有立待决定具體辦法的必要，雙方為這問題折衝多時，一時喧傳已經訂立了防共協定，事實上，日方催逼雖力，還是沒有如願以償。</p>
<p>在第三時期中，開發華北經濟成了日方的中心工作。中日經濟提携，本已喧傳甚久。起初日方似未有具體的計劃提出，至十月間，華北日駐屯軍司令田代和宋哲元會晤時，始將軍部預擬的計劃揭開。按軍部規定開發的經濟範圍，約可分做六個部門；第一是鐵道，第二是港灣，第三是電氣，第四是蘆鹽，第五是鑛山，第六是棉產。依這計劃，盛傳於外的津石鐵路，濟聊鐵路的修築，河海挖深，大沽，岐口闢港，華北電氣事業的發展，棉產改良，設華北鹽業會社，開採龍烟鐵鑛等等，都包括在內。主持華北經濟開發工作的興中公司曾一度擬議將資本由一千萬元加至一萬萬元，後來雖因為日本國內資本家觀望不前，未曾成為事實，而其一番雄心，却由此可以顯然看出。到去年年底為止，中、日華北經濟合作已經實現的第一著是成立惠通公司辦理華北中日通航事宜。惠通公司已於去年十一月十七日在天津開幕，各綫航行並已開始。在醞釀中的有修築滄石鐵路及開辦龍烟鐵鑛二舉，遲早恐怕總要實現的吧？</p>
<p>經濟提携的標榜是合作與互助，不提旁的，卽就去年九月裏的豐台事件與十月底的日軍華北演習兩件事說，已可看出與合作，互助相反的猙獰面目。豐台事件是以日軍無理扣押我二十九軍孫香亭連長起端的，結果却以脅迫我方接受豐台撤兵等等匪夷所思的條件了事。華北日軍演習，從十月二十六日至十一月五日，為時有十日之久，參加人數有七千之多，在我領土上砲火喧天，這樣的舉動，要請主張親善的友邦人士深深反省一下！</p>
<p>㊁政治經濟與建設方面的興革</p>
<p>在過去的一年中，我國在政治，經濟，建設方面，顯然有了很快的開展，茲分項略述於下：</p>
<p>（甲）公佈國民大會組織法代表選舉法及憲法草案國民大會，由中國國民黨第五屆中央執行委員會第二次全體會議議决於去年十一月十二日召開，國民大會代表，限於雙十節以前選出，大會的組織法和代表選舉法，則授權憲法草案審議委員會制定原則，交立法院擬定草案。五月初立法院擬訂草案完竣，十五日由國民政府明令公佈。自選舉法等公佈後，選舉代表事宜已在各省進行，到十月十五日開中央第二十三次常務會議時，鑒於選舉事宜不能如期辦完，决議國民大會延期舉行，等各地代表選竣，再行召集。至於憲法草案，起草始於民國二十二年一月，到九月初藁完成，二十四年十月，經中央常務會議審查完竣，立法院最後議訂的草案，則於去年五月一日經院會三讀通過，於五月五日經國府明令公佈。憲法全文，共分八章，計一百四十八條</p>
<p>（乙）中國國民黨第五屆中央委員第二次全會開會二中全會於七月十日開幕，十四日閉幕，中間曾舉行預備會議一次，大會三次。主席團為蔣中正，孫科，馮玉祥，于右任，丁維汾，居正，陳果夫，王法勤，孔祥熙等九人，葉楚傖為大會秘書長。這次會議决議很多，重要的有關於國防及解决兩廣問題兩案，關於國防，經大會通過組織國防會議，指定李宗仁，白崇禧，陳濟棠等為委員，關於解决兩廣事件的，一為通過明令撤銷西南執行委員會，一為改派余漢謀為廣東綏靖主任，李宗仁與自崇禧為廣西綏靖正副主任，並任林雲陔，黃旭初為廣東，廣西省政府主席</p>
<p>（丙）關於經濟方面，在去年一年中，最為人所注意的事有二：一是統一復興二種公債之發行，二是所得稅暫行條例的通過。統一與復興兩種公債是於二月一日財部宣佈發行的。統一公債發行之目的，是用以掉換政府過去所發行的舊債券，總額為十四萬六千萬元，年息六釐，償還期分十二年，十五年，十八年，廿一年，廿四年五種，每六個月各抽籤還本付息一次，還本付息的基金，仍由關稅項下撥付。復興公債，則作為健全金融組織，扶助生產建設和撥存平準債市基金之用，總額為三萬四千萬元，年息六厘，二十四年還清，還本付息的辦法和基金的撥付，與統一公債完全相同。所得稅草案的擬訂始於去年六月經立法院七月九日第六十八次院會通過，稱所得稅暫行條例，全文共六章二十二條。依據這條例，徵稅的範圍為資本營利所得和一時營利所得，薪給收入所得及證券存欵利息所得，至徵收的稅率是自千份之五起，至千份之二百為止。</p>
<p>（丁）在過去一年中，建設方面最的進步要算交通事業的發展。各省公路，都在飛快地修築。就以經委會督造的各省聯絡公路來說，據到去年十一月所發表的，幹支綫共計長已經有二九八七六公里，至九月底止，已可通車路段有二二九二三公里。鐵道的興建，在去年要以去年九月一日通車的粵漢路為最重要。這條鐵路，北起鄂省武昌，經湖南到廣州，全綫長一九六○公里。南和廣九路，北與平漢路相接，粵漢路實為縱貫中國的最大鐵道。此外如湘黔鐵路（從湖南長沙至貴州貴陽）與成渝鐵路（從成都至重慶）的修建計劃也已見具體化。</p>
<p>㊂兩廣事件</p>
<p>在這國難嚴重之際，應該集中內部力量一致抗敵，萬不應再因對內問題而消耗國力，這乃是國人共守的信條。去年兩廣事件之得以和平解决，雙方沒有以兵</p>
<p>下接第四版</p>
<h3>一年來的中國對外貿易與工商業</h3>
<p>— 孫懷仁</p>
<p>民國二十五年的中國經濟，單從表面上來觀察，自然可以說比二十四年“差强人意”得多了。在對外貿易方面，有過一個月的出超；在農業方面，有過一個極大的豐收；在物價方面，有過高漲的傾向；在外匯方面，有了比較穩定的局面，這種現象當然我們也不否認是一種樂觀的材料，不過，要以這一點材料，就來斷定民國二十五年的中國經濟已經恢復繁榮了，這未免有點近於“非邏輯。”充其量，我們對於民國二十五年的中國經濟，只能說是恐慌沒有劇烈的加深，至於許多經濟的危機，却依然殘存着未曾泯滅。這正因為中國在世界經濟中，不是一個隔絕的孤島，尤其像中國這樣處於“半殖民地”的地位，要擺脫列强的羈絆，單獨的衝出世界恐慌圈而趨於繁榮，這畢竟是事實上所不可能的。不僅這樣，中國經濟本身從民國二十年爆發大恐慌後，六年以來，也已到精疲力盡的境地，要以一點小小的好轉，把牠完全恢復過來，這畢竟也是事實上所不可能的。因此，民國二十五年中國經濟上的一些變化，最大的效果是只能加强對恐慌的抗力，而不能把恐慌根本消滅的。</p>
<p>去年這一年中經濟現象的稍稍好轉，自然不能否認是受了前年十一月幣制改革的刺戟之故。前年的幣制改革，我們當時早就指出了牠的特質，以為拿牠來暫時刺戟一下麻疲的中國經濟，容或是可能的，但要拿來驅除中國經濟的恐慌，那末，幣制本身就壓根兒沒有這能力。這正如百病千瘡的人，單治愈了某一部分的病，而要它完全恢復健康，一樣是不可能的。因此，幣制改革的不能恢復繁榮，决不是幣制本身的功罪。在事實上，去年中國經濟的比較差强人意，這可以說幣制改革已發生了最大效果，在此以上，决不再能有所奢望了。現在，我們就拿民國二十五年的國外貿易與工商業情形來看一看，就可以證實這理論不曾錯誤。</p>
<p>從去年一月到九月止，總共進口六億八千萬元，比前年同期减少了四千萬元；出口為五億一千萬元，反增加了一億一千餘萬了，因而入超額也减少了一億四千七百萬元，而且其中一月份還是一個出超月。這種現象，當然對中國國際貸借上講，是一種有利的展開。而這種有利的展開，當然一部分的原因是由於幣制改革。但除此以外，進口方面還有兩重原因是不能忽略的第一件就是外糧進口的突轉减少（米已由進口第一位降為第八位，小麥已由第六位降為第十三位），這外糧之所以减少，是因為去年海外產量不豐及中國徵米進口稅的緣故。第二件就是由於走私猖獗，許多進口數不曾載入關册之故。假若沒有這兩重原因的存在，那末，去年進口價值上怕不會减少得那麼多。至於出口方面的增多，那就對於世界軍需景氣的因素，不能忽略，我們知道去年出口貨中的前十位，是桐油，生皮皮貨，蛋產品，生絲，茶葉，豬鬃，抽紗桃花，錫錠塊，棉花，芝麻，這十種裏面，譬如蛋產品，生絲，茶葉等比較少軍事意義的東西，在事實上，出口增加旣不大，而地位反已較去年低落了。所以去年中國國際貿易的比較好轉，最初或者可以歸因於新幣制之刺戟，但若沒有其他原因的輔助，也許入超額就不能减得那麽多罷。因走私而使表面上上的入超額减少，這對於中國自然不能說是有利的，不過，進口價值的眞正减少，與輸出價值的眞正增大，這却無可否認是一種好現象。然而在去年的中國貿易上，當局雖然頒布了許多防止走私的條文，但走私之勢未戢，最近華北方面，竟至以汽車公然運輸，稽查處亦無辦法，至於進口的眞正减少，與出口的眞正增加，到第三季以後，已露出了不能持久之象，下表是輸出入的月平均數：（單位百萬元）</p>
<p>在這個數字中，告訴了我們幾件事實：㊀進口月平均數增加得快與出口月平均數增加得慢；㊁第三季的進口月平均數，反而已較前年同期為大；㊂第三季的出口月平均數，反而已較前年同期為少。這事實，正是表示着去年的中國貿易，大體上雖是好轉，但好轉的傾向，到第三季來，已很難支持，甚至竟已回歸到前年同期一樣了。這半年的貿易好轉，對於近年來極度逆態的中國貿易而言，雖然為時甚暫，但終究是很可貴的，然而，就因此要對貿易前途抱樂觀，這是難免要遭這到“幻滅之悲哀”的。</p>
<p>其次，我們再回頭來看一看國內工商業的情形罷。關於工商業的盛衰，一方面可以從商品市價的變化上觀察，一方面可以從工商機關的異動上觀察。在這裏，我們先列出幾種重要市價來：（單位元據中行月刋，）</p>
<p>拿這個商品市價來說，我們無疑的可以看出去年的市價是比前年（除米與生絲）活潑得多了。商品市價的高漲，對於生產業者講，對於中國經濟而言，自然都是一種繁榮的朕兆，不過，我們假若再深刻一層的觀察一下，却發見去年的市價高漲，是包藏着一些缺陷的。第一點我們可以指出來的，就是價格上漲的沒有持續性。在前面那些商品中，除掉棉紗，米，小麥，麵粉以外，各種商品的價格，都反有着陸續下降的傾向。本來，在幣值降低後的去年，卽令物價是有意的不讓牠高漲，但總不至於會反呈逐月降落之勢的，因此，這個市價上漲的不能持續，恐怕還是由於實需不振的緣故。第二點我們可以指出來的，是農產品與工業品價格上漲的不調和。前面那十種商品中，價格比較前年漲得不大或甚至反落的，有生絲，棉花，綠茶，紅茶，米五種，其餘五種，牠漲的程度都要比前五種大得多，而這漲得快的幾種商品，除小麥以外，都是工業製品。這一個事業，在中國經濟上講，不能說是一種健全的現象，這因為農產品與工業品價格的開差，在農業人口占大多數的中國，無異是相對的縮小了購買力與市塲。以上那兩點缺陷之中，自然以後一點比較更有嚴重性。在去年，却巧碰到了未曾有的豐年。同時，災害也不甚普遍，所以這點缺陷，還沒有發生如何顯著的惡象。假若今年的自然環境，不能像去年那樣好，而且通貨也不能有一個更擴張的發行，那末，物價要使其穩定着不落，就不能不有相當的困難了。</p>
<p>再關於工商機關的異動方面，現在全國系統的材料雖還沒有，但僅就上海一地而論，那末，只能說比前年的情形，轉好一些，而不能說已臻繁榮。據中國徵信所的調查，去年三季的上海工商業異動，有如次表：</p>
<p>從這個統計數字看來，那末去年三季中，工商業的新創數已在逐月增加，相反的閉歇數已在逐漸减少，這似乎正是象徵着去年工商已趨繁榮，但實則把牠的內容檢查一下，便可以發見了許多不盡然的事實。</p>
<p>由這一個內容的分析，我們就可以得到了幾種準確的觀念；第一點應該注意的就是本年來新創最多的是特種事業，第一季中首推衛生娛樂業，第二季中首推旅館飲食，到了第三季的末月，竟一變而要首推娼妓變相之“嚮導社”了，至於特種事業中重要的如金融業建築業，幾乎是沒有發展；第二點須要注意，是製造工業的沒有顯著發展，在第一季中，新創了六家，却倒閉了四十家，第二季新創了十二家，而倒閉了三十六家，第三季九月新創了七家，却倒閉了一○家；第三點可以注意的，是販賣商業中改組，收縮與閉歇的趨勢特別大，實已遠駕於新發展以上；第四點要注意的，這統計中所收的資料，是不分鉅細的，單以家數而不以規模來論斷，是難免有些危險性的。合這幾點而言，那末我們大膽的可以斷定，去年工商業的發展，還不曾俱有着眞正的健全性。而且，統括的說來，假若以新創與擴充為好現象，而以收縮，改組與閉歇為壞現象，那末去年前者與後者的比例，就是約當一比六左右。</p>
<p>由以上國外貿易與上海工商情形而推論，（實則其他情形，亦復大同小異），很足以證明了我們前面所說的話，亦卽去年的中國經濟，大體上可以說比較“差强人意”了些，但這個“差强人意”，充其量只能使中國對恐慌的抗力加强一些，根本還談不到繁榮。而眞正要使中國繁榮，怕還要經過幾次幣制改革以上的經濟改革罷。</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>戎相見，是最值得額手稱慶的一會事。</p>
<p>兩廣與中央對立之尖銳化，乃因抗敵意見之不同而起。兩廣方面，主張立即抗敵，六月初疊發冬，支二電請求中央領導出兵。這旗幟既經張起後，兩廣即抽調軍隊北上，粤軍沿粤漢路北進，桂軍由零陵北進，先後達到湘省衡陽的南面。同時中央於湘贛幾省，亦抽調重兵防守，一時大有一觸即發之勢。幸而中央始終採用政治方式解決的途徑，西南當局亦不願犧牲實力於內爭，總算沒有形成內戰。這事件自陳濟棠手下第二軍副軍長李漢魂及第一軍軍長余漢謀通電擁護中央後而有一大轉機。七月十三日二中全會決議免去陳濟棠本兼各職，以余漢謀繼任綏靖主任，陳氏既被逼離粤，於是廣東部份宣告解決。廣西一部分問題，原亦可同時結束，適以國府發表更換李宗仁，自崇禧廣西正副綏靖主任職為軍委會常委及浙江省政府主席的明令，中途又橫生波折。七月二十八日李白在邕召集軍事會議，態度突轉強硬。八月初外邊甚至有組織獨立政府的謠傳。雙方相持不下者多時，國府司法院院長居正，參謀總長程潛，軍委會辦公廳主任朱培德三人出任疏解，於九月二日飛往邕寧，與李白商量和平解決辦法。幾經磋商，至九月六日，極沈悶的局面終於打破，決定的辦法是仍任李宗仁為廣西綏靖主任，自崇禧則調任為軍委會常委，一塲軒然大波，總算和平解決，眞為不幸中之大幸。</p>
<p>㊃綏遠戰事</p>
<p>吾們只要把緩遠戰事的前後略略看一下，就可明白這次綏遠戰事一不是局部的事情，二不是偶然發生的事情，牠只是某方鯨吞華北計劃的一部份與其發展中必然出現的階段。</p>
<p>匪偽的進犯綏遠，去年七八月間已經小試其鋒，常時雖被擊退，因為後面的指揮者野心未殺，緊張的情勢並未少减。十一月初果然又不時有騷擾的舉動，至十一日商都匪偽等雜軍，在李守信指揮之下，向綏東陶林一帶進攻。匪偽進犯的計劃，大概是分做綏北。綏東兩路，綏北方面是以百靈廟為根據地，或下武川而取歸綏，或下固陽而佔包頭；綏東方面則想由商都逕取集寗，切斷晋綏冀三省的聯絡。十一月底至十二月初，匪偽就按照這樣計劃攻撲。在戰爭的過程中，匪偽的器械，指揮者都由某方供給，關東軍部並且有派正規軍協助的擬議。後方的策動者某方原期一鼓而下歸綏。包頭，不料十一月二十三晚我軍奮勇應戰，覓於二十四日晨將百靈廟佔領，於十二月十日又將百靈廟西百六十里之大廟克復，這是綏戰中之重大關鍵，一則這兩次勝利證明了一部份人失敗主義心理的錯誤，二則百靈廟。大廟為匪偽綏北之重要軍事根據地，攻下後清除了綏北匪偽脅迫的危機。綏戰起初在我方是防禦的意味較多，到百靈廟。大廟克復後情勢為之一變，如其要發動帶有積極性的抗戰，這應該看作很有利的起點。</p>
<p>自從綏戰發生以來，我們看到了一個極可欣喜的現象，這就是全國上下援綏的熱烈。有財力的踴躍輸將，自屬意料，沒有資力的，甚至絕食捐欵寄給前方將士，這樣高漲的民族意識，民族情緒，是中華民族解放運動成功的朕兆！</p>
<p>㊄西安事變</p>
<p>到去年十二月，大家看看無論內政外交似乎都沒有重大的波瀾了，以為可以平穩過這殘年，那裏料想得到還有西安事變來做這一年小史的壓卷文章。</p>
<p>據傳事變醞釀已久，一年前，張學良幕中的所謂少壯東北派如苗勁然，應得一等，卽已漸漸得勢。張部下王以哲。何柱國所屬青年將校附從他們的很多。兩月前卽擬發動，通電亦已草就，卒以莫德惠力勸而罷。十一月底內情益形緊急，張學良於十二月三日曾飛洛謁蔣委員長，蔣以為一經曉諭，當可釋然，定於十二日晨親自對駐西安軍隊訓話，不料反為所乘，十二日早晨，張部下叛變，將蔣刦持，同時中央軍政長官被扣者為蔣鼎文•朱紹良•陳誠•陳繼承•衛立煌•萬耀煌•陳調元•馬占山•曾擴情•邵力子•錢大鈞•張冲•蔣方震等，計共十三人之多，殉難者為邵元冲•蔣孝先•簫乃華•楊振亞等。</p>
<p>自事變發生至記者撰述本文脫稿時為止，關於這次事變之解决，已經過幾度的轉折。十二日國民政府下令將張學良褫職嚴辦，這可表明政府對於處理這次事變的基本看法。十四日曾任張學良顧問之澳洲人端納飛赴西安與張學良晤商，給張學良等一個悔悟轉圜之餘地，這是第一個轉折。端納回來後，似未見有多大的開展與轉機，於是十六日國府遂有討伐之令，任何應欽為討逆總司令，十七日續派劉峙為討逆軍東路集團軍總司令，顧祝同為討逆軍西路集團軍總司令，這是第二個轉折。十七日原來被一同刦持的蔣鼎文氏由西安飛京，携來蔣委員長親筆信，手諭何總司令暫時停止轟炸，這是第三個轉折。二十日宋子文飛西安，晤蔣委員長，張學良等，二十一日返京，二十二日與蔣夫人再飛西安。二十五日下午蔣委員長脫險由西安飛至洛陽，一場軒然大波，得以和平解决，這是值得吾們額手稱慶的。</p>
<h3>一年來的國際局勢</h3>
<p>— 紀難</p>
<p>近數年來，論者咸以一九三六年為國際危機最嚴重之年，為第二次世界大戰可能爆發之年，惴惴於舉世慘變之未能或免，人類浩刦之勢將再見。然事實上一九三六年已於憂危震憾中渡過。一年之中，國際局勢變幻多端，和平與侵略兩大勢力互有消長，雖世界之若干部分不免於紛擾，而大體言之，所謂第二次世界大戰之爆發，迄未見諸事實。吾人試就一年來國際間重要動態，分析其內在之性質，觀察其相互之關係，當不無跡象可尋也。</p>
<p>二月下旬，去年五月間所簽訂之法俄互助公約得法國衆院之通過而正式批准。該公約規定：“法俄兩國未經挑釁而遭受侵略時，兩國相約立刻互相援助；”“非國聯會員國從事侵略而以法俄兩國為其侵略目標，法俄兩國亦相約立刻互相援助；”其意義實為對德。於是不旋踵而有三月七日希特勒片面宣佈廢止洛迦諾公約駐兵萊茵之學，十餘年來西歐集體安全之制度，摧毀無遺，全球震駭，局勢驟趨緊張。廢約之藉口，雖曰法俄公約違反洛迦諾精神予德國以重大威脅，而事實上希特勒之企圖擺脫戰後之條約束縛，本為其一貫之政策。自意阿戰爭發生，德意志卽已沉機觀變，蹈瑕伺隙，以圖恢復其大戰前之地位。治英意兩國以制裁問題而劍㧞弩張，斯特萊柴陣綫瀕於破裂，聯合抗德亦不可能。同時國聯正焦頭爛額於對意制裁之失效，决無餘力以懲處德國之破壤條約，故遭受國聯制裁之危險亦毋庸過慮。此希特勒之所以甘冒天下之大不韙而出此非常之舉也。吾人觀乎德軍進駐萊茵以後，法國之態度雖堅决異常，主張嚴厲制裁，要求洛迦諾簽字國作軍事上之援助，申請國聯採取嚴峻之處置，並召集簽字國代表成立四國協定，抱不撤兵不談判之决心；而卒以英國之態度模稜，德意之漸形接近，不敢貿然開釁，坐視保障法比國境安全之公約為希特勒所一手撕毀而無如之何；可見西歐諸國之矛盾方深，正未易協調以共制侵略勢力之膨漲而維持集體安全之生存也。</p>
<p>關於意阿戰爭，自去年五月發生以來，以英意兩國利害衝突之深刻，識者早目為大戰爆發之重要因素。英國以意大利在東菲勢力之擴張足以直接動搖其地中海之霸權，間接影響不列顚帝國之存亡，故始終對意頻施壓力，目不情以全力支持國聯對意制裁之實施。然法國為顧全對德陣線起見，不欲重傷意國感情，雖贊助制裁而未能與英採取同一步驟。因此國聯之制裁辦法不能澈底，進行困難，鮮有實效。去年十二月，霍爾—賴伐爾之和平方案失敗以後，妥協之望已絕，英國乃進一步加緊制裁，提出禁油問題。然法國又深恐因此擴大戰爭範圍而始終掣肘，遂致遷移不决，坐失時機。迨希特勒乘機片面宣佈废止洛迦諾公約駐兵萊茵之後，欧陸国家不得不轉其視線於萊茵河畔之緊張局勢，而法國遭此非常之變，正倉皇失措於應付之困難，更無餘緒再事顧及並無直接關係之意阿糾紛，遂令墨索里尼得從容用武於東菲，於五月初攻陷阿京，取阿比西尼並皇帝之尊號加諸意王。從此地中海為英意兩國所共有，英國因馬爾太島之海軍根據地受意大利雄厚空軍之威脅，喪失其控制地中海之值值，海上通路隨時有被意大利截斷之可能，數百年來之地中海霸權亦已開始動搖。然英國雖痛切肌膚，而事實所限，戰爭為情勢所弗許，不得不委曲求全，忍痛讓步，撤銷制裁以求緩和於一時。顧兩國在地中海上之角逐，明爭暗鬥，方興未艾，吾人固不能以暫時之緩和而遂謂爭端已得合理之解决。近羅馬又盛倡英意君子協定之議，主張兩國應以承認相互利益為基礎，成立誠意的，迅速的，與澈底的諒解，以圖打開僵局。惟意大利旣視地中海與生命相等，而英國亦以地中海之交通自由為帝國存亡所繫，雙方或可暫時妥協，但衝突危機之是否眞能泯除，似尚有待於事態之演變。</p>
<p>七月中旬，西班牙發生右派武力暴動之變亂，企圖顚覆政府，建立獨裁政權；舉世矚目，為意阿戰爭告一段落後歐陸之又一巨變。蓋叛軍方面實與德意兩國先有默契，而政府軍則深獲法俄諸國之同情，其意義之嚴重，固不僅西班牙國內左右兩派之衝突已也。英法兩國，深恐因此引發大戰危機，乃倡為對西不干涉協定，促德意葡俄等國相繼加入，以免捲入戰爭漩渦。然事實上德意葡三國對於叛軍之援助始終不絕，使叛軍得以節節獲勝，迭陷名城。迨十月中，瑪德里京城陷於重圍，戰事達於最嚴重之階段，於是蘇俄以德意葡三國之破壞協定已迫其不能再事漢視，卽向不干涉協定調整委員會宣佈保留自由行動。故兩月以來，瑪德里城之砲火連天，已不啻蘇俄與德意之决戰。倘調整委員會不能迅作有效之處置，則萬一舉措不愼，更進而為露骨之衝突，勢將引起歐洲政治家所不願應付之局勢，而其後果，寗堪設想？近英法兩國又有調解之建議，主張雙方罷兵，由公民投票决政體之適從。此舉倘能順利進行，自可暫時緩和危局。惟德意葡三國能否不為已甚，殊難逆料。依目前情勢觀之，三國似尚無接受建議之誠意，妥協希望，黯淡異常，西亂前途，實堪憂慮。</p>
<p>奧地利介於德意兩大之間，德國久欲兼併以實現其第三帝國之企圖　　　　凡爾賽絛約及聖日耳曼條約之限制，與小協約國及英法之干涉，未能實現；尤以意大利因勃倫納山隘之安全與多瑙河流域經濟計劃之發展，與德衝突最烈，極力反對。憶一九三四年七月，奧國社黨受希特勒之嗾使舉行暴動，奪取政權，陶爾夫斯慘遭殺害時，意大利立刻陳兵邊境，抱武力干預之决心；局勢緊張，不可終日，中欧和平，危如纍卵。論者謂奧地利為中歐之火藥庫，洵非虛語。近三年來，奧國問題已為德意爭執之焦點，問題一日存在，兩國邦交卽一日不易妥協。然而曾幾何時，國際局勢之推移，使外交手腕之運用變化莫測；希特勒乘國聯忙於應付東菲糾紛無暇他顧之機會，突然駐兵萊茵，意國禁油之厄，因以得解；此種相互為用之事實，開德意合作之端，兩國咸知急宜除去妥協之障碍，迅卽成立諒解以對抗英法之壓力。因此德奧兩國竟在墨索里尼斡旋之下，於七月十日成立協定。中歐糾紛，告一段落。從此德意兩大法西斯勢力開始携手，斯特萊柴陣綫不復存在，德國得自法國領導之包圍陣綫下脱穎而出，傾全力以向東歐發展，形成德匈意奧等國之大集團，與法俄對峙；而歐洲顯然分為兩大陣營，勢均力敵，互相備戰。戰前之對峙局勢乃重現矣。</p>
<p>如上所述，歐洲兩大集團，一方面以法俄為主體，得小協約國之擁護；一方面以德意為中心，與奧匈保阿諸國相聯合英國則居於集團之外，猶冀避免對峙局勢之釀成，舉棋未定。其他小國，感於危機之日迫，為自國安全計，俱在彷徨苦悶，無所適從。然數月以來，兩大集團咸圖拉攏與國以自重，外交家車騎四出，活躍異常，縱橫椑闔，盡勾心鬥角之能事。如法波兩國，忽於九月初成立財政軍事協定，重修舊好，使一九三四年來德波之合作，歸於泡影。蓋波蘭之獨立，由於凡爾賽和約之保障，兩年來希特勒之任意撕毀和約，視同廢紙，實使波蘭寒心；况但澤問題與波蘭走廓始終為德波間衝突之癥結；波蘭自不能不亟謀自慮，幡然變計，復歸於法國之集團，而恢復一九二○年之軍事同盟。此其意義，使法國之外交環圈又復連接，法俄波以及小協約國站在同一陣綫。今後德國將决不能飛渡波蘭之領土以進攻烏克蘭，法俄及小協約國亦必援助波蘭以抗德國之侵入，而德國東進計劃又多一重障碍。又如十一月間希特勒之三度破壞和約，宣告廢止國際通航條欵，雖意在藉此與關係各國交換種種利益，而脅迫捷克之轉向，實為最大目標。捷克為戰後新興國家，賴和約以維持其生存，向與法國關係密切。德意處心積慮，久欲拉攏小協約國以削弱法俄力量。南羅兩國或者尚易接近，惟捷克以第三帝國倘一旦實現，直不啻宣告其死刑，故對於法國與小協約之同盟及捷俄公約必仍信守勿渝。於是德國乃廢止通航條欵，使捷克不再能利用愛爾柏河及多瑙河之國際航道，更無由通達德國境內之漢堡與斯丹丁自由港口，絕其出路，以為威脅。其意義之嚴重，不僅予捷克以一大打擊，亦卽間接對法國示威。再如十月間意外長齊亞諾伯爵聘問柏林，舉行意德談話，决定改善英意關係，倡議締結地中</p>

<p>海君子協定，以謀拉攏英國；十一月下旬，日德協定與日意協定先後宣告成立，以反蘇聯陣綫為號召，東西相應；皆為意德集團企圖擴大勢力之表現•至於十月間比利時之宣佈恢復戰前中立政策，雖與英法不利，而不利之程度實並不如表面所傳之甚。蓋此利時目睹國聯威權日漸减削，洛迦諾公約已遭廢棄，英法兩國之步調又不一致，未來洛迦諾會議尚多荊棘，其國境安全之保障喪失殆盡；乃不能不急起自謀，充實國防，並避免參加與本國無關之戰事。然地理上之形勢，終屬不能變更，比利時是否能在未來大戰中不再蹈一九一四年之覆轍，殊未可必。設德意志再度破壤比利時之中立，則比固拚死抵抗，而英法亦勢不能坐視；結果仍將使比利時與英法方面重行聯合。比利時之表示不擬漠視各項國際義務與繼續尊重法比軍事協定，蓋以此也。</p>
<p>關於遠東方面，自九一八日本獨佔東省以後，華盛頓會議所產生之海軍條約，九國公約，與四國公約，均已摧毀無餘，太平洋均勢宣告破裂，日美日英間之衝突漸形尖銳，日俄對立益見加深，而英美俄三國反有逐漸成立諒解之趨勢。一月間日本退出倫敦海會，不願參加一九三六年海軍新約以後，太平洋局勢又轉入一更險惡之階段。關係各國，一面競事造艦，一面計劃設防太平洋島嶼，咸圖以大海軍大空軍政策保全勢力。俄國為保障國境安全計，尤不得不積極佈防，準備抵抗。其東海濱省之烏蘇里雙軌鐵道，及西伯利亞鐵路自貝加爾湖至伯力一段之雙軌，俱已完成；黑龍江至烏蘇里江沿岸之炮台四十九座，及由黑海以達太平洋之鐵道七千里，正在趕築。日俄關係，益趨緊張矣。</p>
<p>綜上以觀，整個世界，業已分成兩大壁壘。戰後國際之均勢，一變而為集團之對立。德意集團懷抱絕大野心，意圖變更疆界；法俄集團力謀保障安全，努力維持現狀。一俟準備就緒，實力充足，則侵略集團勢必借端起釁，和平集團亦將不再容忍；以歐洲暗礁之衆多，遠東關係之復雜，幾無時無地皆可引起大衝突，第二次世界大戰之爆發，僅屬時間問題。英國徘徊兩大集團之間，有舉足輕重之勢，一面固欲維持現狀，一面則又深恐左傾勢力之抬頭，其舉措對於整個局勢之影響最堪注意。依其傳統之保守政策，向主保全實利；目前似尚擬在遠東方面對日成立諒解以期保全經濟勢力，在歐洲方面與德意妥協以期保持地中海地位，企圖召開新洛迦諾會議，避免戰爭。吾人對於大戰之能否避免，將於未來洛迦諾會議中英法步調之是否一致，與太平洋上英美之是否眞能合作卜之。時機迫切，稍縱卽逝，上次大戰之慘酷，猶在目前，所望各國政治家懲前毖後，放大目光，亟謀有效的弭戰之道也。</p>
<h3>一年中實業建設之回顧</h3>
<p>— 吳鼎昌</p>
<p>自蔣院長出長行政院以來，卽集中實業建設。總理說：“建設之首要在民生。”蔣院長亦謂：“我們中國當前的國難，雖然是多方面的，但是最嚴重的，莫如經濟的衰竭—全國總崩潰的危機。”今日之實業建設，實有刻不客緩者在。本人出任實業行政，瞬及一年；而輔佐國民經濟建設委員會總會之職責，亦已數月，仰體總理遺敎及蔣院長訓示，目睹當前民生疾苦，經濟困窮，益自奮勵，莫敢曷懈。惟以實業建設，經緯萬端，且事業之成、輒需年歲。短縮一年之中，自不易多所建樹。茲屆歲首，謹對於過去一年中設施，作一簡單之檢討，諒亦偽閱者所樂許。</p>
<p>一年來之實業建設，自犖犖大者述之，約有數事：</p>
<p>一•農業建設農業建設，頭緒紛繁。最近農村破產，尤感百廢待舉。除行政效率力求增進外，對於農業技術之改良，農村金融之調劑，均認為當前切要之圖。必須早日奠定基礎。</p>
<p>㊀技術方面係由中央農業實騐所及稻麥改進所分負其責。技術改良，雖不易有顯著之紀錄，但如改良稻種之推行。在蘇，皖，湘等省帽子頭良種之推廣，已達三萬一千零三十八畝，並選良種一萬四千餘担，準備明年擴大推廣。可至二十餘萬畝。良種示範農田，在蘇，皖，湘三省，亦達二十三縣。棉種試騐，成效尤極優良。斯字第四號棉種，已普及華北，德字第五三一號棉種，則大量向長江流域推廣。本年棉產豐收，與此實有相當之聯繫。明年將更進一步為大規模之推廣，其他如小麥及各種雜糧，均在改良試騐中。㊁農業金融方面，農本局之成立，對於農業金融，實樹立一强固之基礎。该局固定資金與合放貲金共六千萬元，由政府與銀行各認半數，五年撥足。並視客觀之需要如何，再隨時由該局，與銀行界協定流通貲金之多寡。合作金庫辦法業經頒布，暫定中央合作金庫貲金至少一千萬元，省合作金庫貲金至少一百萬元，縣合作金庫貲金至少十萬元。全國倉庫網亦已擬定計劃，卽待完成，預定分甲，乙，丙，丁四級，統籌全國農產運銷。預計總容量為二萬萬市担，共需經費一七，六二一，三四四元。均由農本局分別進行。㊂合作事業，行政指導已完全統一，决定重質不重量，以期合作社正规的發展。並着手根本的训練人才，普及合作敎育，求技術方面之改進。合作技術人員訓練班，及各省區巡迴合作技術講習會均定於明年一月中起次第實施。而合作金庫行將成立，貲金充實，合作事業，自易發展，以期奠定農村合作改進之基礎。</p>
<p>二•工業建設工業建設乃現代化之契機，與農村經濟之復興，尤有密切之聯系。檢閱一年來之工業建設，亦有數點，足徵進步。㊀技術改進。關於工業技術之改進，可自專利准許及工業獎勵之增加表明之。本年截至十一月底止，核准專利者巴達二十九件，較之去年全年之二十一件，廿三年全年之二十五件，顯有增益。且係採嚴格主義，十一個月以來，核駁者計一百廿餘件，之多。工業獎勵方面，至十一月底止，計准予專製權者十一件，准免關稅者十九件减低國營交通事業運輸費者十七件，共四十九件，較之去年全年三十六件已多十一件。㊁大小工業之振興較大工業之本年有進展者，計有一，中央機器廠，開辦費六十萬元，設備費十二萬三千餘英鎊。在英購置之機件，本年內已分批運竣。廠屋建築並已完成鑄鐵鑄鋼機器三廠。現與鐵道部協商合作辦法，以期銷路穩固，不日卽可開工。二，酒精工業。除官商合辦之中國酒精製造股份公司去年一月業已開工外，本年陝西省復辦酒精廠一所，合榨油以脫洋鐵筒等四廠全部資本二百三十萬元。本年十一月天津機器製造酒精公司亦成立，資本總額五十萬元。三，造紙工業。官商合辦溫溪造紙廠資本已定四百五十萬元，刻正積極進行外，粵省復設新式紙廠三家，閩贛兩省亦已籌劃對原有紙業加以整頓。四，氮氣工業。永利公司承辦之硫酸铔廠，在江蘇六合縣建立廠屋，全部工程本年業已完成。該廠資金除原發行公司債五百五十萬元外，本年復改增發行公司債額一千五百萬元。主要設倫計有硫酸廠，硝酸廠，合成铔廠，水煤氣廠等，規模尚屬宏大。又天利氮氣製品公司，早經籌備，資金計一百萬元，本年初已正式製造，每年可產液體氬八千磅，硝酸一萬三千磅及硝酸铔硝酸鈣鹽化铔等品共九千九百磅。五，植物油工業。植物油為吾國出口貨之大宗，就二十四年而言，油類出口達五七，二七二，四二六元。幾佔輸出總額十分之一。故植物油工業之盛衰，關係於整個國民經濟之影響非常重大；其中尤以桐油為最，全世界所需桐油，除安南印度外，幾全賴吾國供給，據關冊統計自民國二年於植物油項下劃分列計該年卽逾三百萬兩，嗣後迭見遞增，中間幾年雖偶有退减，然至去年卒達四一，五八二，八七九元，一躍而登出口貨之第一位·其於國際貿易上之重要，於此可見。惟因品質方面尚欠純潔，價格供給方面，亦尚欠穩定，本部為提高國際信譽起見，特聯合浙江，四川，湖南，湖北，江西，安徽，廣西等七省產桐油區，籌設植物油料廠，資本定為二百萬元，官商合作。其主要業務則為：㊀代理桐油之貯存及煉榨；㊁代理其他植物油之貯存及煉榨；㊂代理承辦押借押滙報關運輸及其他便利銷售各事項；㊃提煉潤機油料；㊄製造油漆塗料。總辦事處設於漢口，並擬於上海漢口長沙常德萬縣重慶等地，分設油廠。上海，萬縣油廠廠址，均已覓定，重慶，常德，長沙，漢口各油廠設計，亦均在進行中，明年中皆可開工。並另購新式榨機，分布各省改良土榨，以期减低成本，增高油質。六，製糖工業。製糖業近年較有進展，公營者前有廣東省營製糖各廠，近有四川內江糖廠之設立，資本定為一千萬元，第一期資金為二百萬元。先辦第一廠，出糖年約萬噸，五年內次第完成五廠，年產糖五萬噸。又溥益實業公司所營之山東製糖工廠，成立於民國九年，實為吾國採用甜菜製糖之首創者。資本為二百五十萬元。廠址位於濟南黃台橋。主要出品為機製白糖，年產量約一萬噸，如甜菜原料充足可增至五萬噸，並附設酒精工廠，卽以製糖剩餘之廢蜜為釀造酒精原料，民國十六年因受時局影響停頓。二十四年已實行復工，開始製造。以上各點，亦足以略窺吾國本年工業情况好轉之概略。但麵粉業，紡織業，絲綢業均為吾國重要工業，一年以來因外貨傾銷及華北走私影響，營業尚難擴張。至民營小工廠本年新廠登記者有一百一十六廠，資本一百八十七萬二千餘元。（三）火柴業產銷聯營，近年來火柴業岌岌可危，本年三月間特核准產銷聯營辦法。互相協作，限制生產，計華廠加入者五十八家，美廠二家，日廠七家。營業前途，頗有進步，總之，上述工業現象之略有好轉，亦不過為國人共同協力之微末曙光，未來工業之如何推進，均待吾人繼續之努力。明年工業計畫，政府認為卽須定一全國工業支配案，（一）何種重工業，由中央舉辦。（二）何種輕工業，由中央提倡人民舉辦，（三）何種地方工業，由中央補助各省單獨或聯合舉辦。（四）何種特殊工業，由中央補助有關係之省分共同舉辦。資本來源如何，需要供給之調整如何，均須通盤計議，以期避免重複，分清責任，為共同之進行，現已奉院長命，為明年（二十六年）歲首必須完成之工作也。</p>
<p>三•商業建設一年來之商業建設較為重要者，厥有數端；㊀國貨聯合營業公司之籌設，本公司在實業部監督之下，暫由中央及地方政府，國貨工廠，國貨公司，聯合集資組織而成。資本暫定二百萬元，政府合認三分之一，各國貨工廠公司合認三分之二，推銷國貨以此為中心，甚得各方同情，籌備處業已成立，（二）設置國產檢騐委員會，國產商品，多無標準品級，不合現代貿易，亦不足以利推銷，本年二月特設國產檢騐委員會。選派專家為委員，先後舉辦祁門屯溪茶葉，湘省米糧之檢騐，商人稱便。（三）協助南洋商業考察。中華工業國貨貿易協會以南洋各屬華僑衆多，貿易重要。爰於本年組織南洋商業考察團，並携帶國產隨地展覽，本部曾予以協助。該團於七月十六日出國，十月二十六日回抵上海，歷經菲律賓及英，法，荷屬各埠，得到僑胞熱烈歡迎。（四）推進國際貿易。本年世界經濟略呈佳象，本為推進海外貿易之良機，本部有見及此，諸多從事。如㊀增騐出口商品，主要者，出口如柏油每年約十二萬公担，入口如棉種為數亦多，均加檢騐，而生絲分級檢騐，亦己實施，㊁推進茶葉水菓之輸出事宜，均先後在國際貿易局成立專組。㊂籌設進出口商品經理所，辦法正在審議之中。㊃設立駐日商務官。均為調整國際貿易之誘助本年國際貿易情况亦呈好轉。入超較之去年相對减少，以今年一月至十月與去年同期比較入超由三三六，五五○，五四八元减到二二六，四○四，九二五元，計减少一一○，一四五，六二三元。（一月份為出超）國內商業亦較為活躍，未始非可欣喜之現象也。</p>

<h3>元旦獻辭</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>（一）向悲觀的我，在國軍收復百靈廟時快樂一陣子以後，却不道樂極生悲，在民國二十五年十二月十二日那天得到西安張楊叛變的惡消息，頓時好像著了－箇窩心拳，被打落在一團陰霾裏頭，苦悶得甚麼似的。直到十二月二十五日午後六時四十五分從無綫電中聽到了蔣委員長脫險返洛的喜訊，猛覺得陰霾四散，重見霽月光風，於是把苦悶一筆勾消，歡天喜地的一直快樂到了今天元旦，便懷着滿腔子快樂的心情，來向“婦女與兒童”特刋的讀者說幾句話。</p>
<p>檢討這過去的一年中，全國的婦女界與兒童界，確已覺悟到國難的嚴重，不再一味的在奢靡與荒嬉中討生活，而漸漸地都能努力於伊們的工作，這是一種很可樂觀的現象。尤其在綏遠抗戰發生後，全國的婦女們都在千針萬綫的縫製寒衣，給前方的將士們禦冷，全國的兒童們，都在奔走呼號的募集金錢，給前方的將士們療飢，這確是一服很有效力的奮興劑，足以鼓勵將士們奮勇殺敵的。</p>
<p>自西安事變蔣委員長蒙難之後，全國的婦女與兒童也都有很沉痛很懇切的表示，我們到處都聽到女學生們痛哭流涕，憂慮國家大局之將不可收拾，連我家七歲的小兒子，放學回來，也在喊着“蔣委員長不出來，我們中國不得了”的口號，這就足見無論婦女，無論兒童，都在關心國事，而知道國家的可愛了。先前一般悲觀的人，鑒於民氣的消沉，往往歎息着說：“中國不亡，决無天理”，而我看了近來的種種現象，不由得很樂觀的說：“中國而亡，决無天理”。</p>
<p>今天是民國二十六年的元旦了，蔣委員長早又在主持國家大計，領導全民族向前作生存的抗爭了。我希望全國的婦女與兒童追隨着伊們的丈夫或父母，一致的為祖国努力。要知這不是蔣委員長一人的事，是我們全民族的事，無論是婦女，是兒童，都得聳起肩來，帮助着他老人家共同來挑這副救國的重擔。</p>
<h3>一九三七年的中國婦女</h3>
<p>— 守眞</p>
<p>一九三六年的中國是在患難中過去了，在這一年中，中國受盡了敵人的欺凌，而且更在這快結束的年尾，又發生了內部的奇恥大辱！喪心病狂的叛逆，斷送了東北四省不够，還預備把整個的中華民國斷送了！吾全國同胞在痛定思痛之餘，悲憤地度過了這可恨可恥的殘年！</p>
<p>現在一九三七年正在開始，國家民族的危機壓在我們每一個國民的頭上；無論是男女，無論是老幼。</p>
<p>現在這新年的第一日，我們就要用我們新的目光，和新的企圖來預備奮鬥了！我們全中國的女同胞，要和全國的男同胞站在一條戰綫上，擁護政府，帮助政府，對外抵抗敵人，對內肅清叛逆，助成建設，有一分力量就貢獻一分給我們的國家，有一分才能就為國家做一分事。在這裏我想提出幾點小小的計劃，來和我們女同胞們商榷。</p>
<p>第一我們從今年今天起大家努力地充實自己的力量，我們學識不够的，用功讀書，經騐不够的努力做事，常識缺乏的，盡量地與社會接觸，從各方面去使自己學習，我們决不要坐在旁邊，埋怨別人，也不要空空希望別人來援助我，這樣才有實在的力量來貢獻給社會。</p>
<p>第二我們竭力要節制靡費，增加生產，一方面對於自己的用度竭力節省，使一個錢也不無謂的浪費了，一方面就自己能力所及的做事，絕對不要輕視了自己，存心依賴男子。因為這樣是足以由於每個家庭經濟而影響到整個的國家社會的財富的，我們現在只有减輕家庭的負担才能使國民經濟活動起來。</p>
<p>第三要看清楚自己的國家現狀，和現在的世界大勢，我們要開始着研究國內外的各種問題而决定了自己的志願，不但自己本身堅决地擁擠國家，而且要把正確的思想，灌輸給年輕年幼的兒女們，養成下一代的健全國民。</p>
<p>第四我們就得勇敢堅毅地向男同胞們表示，以後盼望他們不要看輕了我們的力量，事業是整個的人羣創造的，分不出男或女，我們也不和他們站在對立的戰綫，大家是一致的，在各個不同部門中，他們需要我們帮助，我們也需要他們帮助，總之大家都以救國為目標。</p>
<p>一九三七年的中國要由重重壓力下抬頭了！一九三七年的中國婦女也已經在重重帳幕中覺醒了！親愛的女同胞們，相信你們都願意以這新的典型獻給全世界的婦女吧！</p>
<h3>民國廿六年的婦女</h3>
<p>— 易龍</p>
<p>時代的輪子不停地向前走着，被世人公認為戰爭危機的一九三六年，已經算是平安地過去了，一九三七年新的歷史又將展開在我們眼前。它帶來的是戰爭呢，或許是和平呢？我們都暫且不談，先來談談我們婦女本身的第一個問題吧。</p>
<p>一年來，中國的婦女也跟着時代的輪子，一樣地前進着，雖然，一方面我們眼見着許多都市女子沉醉在脂粉的生活中，但一方面，又看見了千千萬萬婦女喊出了熱烈的呼聲，流出了鮮紅的赤血，尤其是從綏東的抗敵戰爭爆發後，全國的婦女，甚至是舞女也好，妓女也好（緩遠省妓女曾組織慰問團赴前綫），他們都為這個敵人的砲聲嚇醒了起來，有力的出力，有錢的出錢，這種為民族生存而奮鬬的婦女，雖然還不能鼓動各階層生活的婦女們，一致總動員起來，但至少也表現出了一九三六年中國婦女運動的新滋長，最低度也要把那種驅逐婦女回到廚房去的士紳們，說得體無完膚。</p>
<p>因為民族空前的危機，助長了婦女運動的高漲。以致一九三六年中國的前進婦女，都是在奮鬬中生長着。一九三七年的中國婦女，我們更應當希望貫澈這種精神，努力去學習西班牙內戰中人民陣綫婦女英勇的姿態，學習秋瑾先烈革命的精神，我們婦女的第一個問題——爭取澈底的全民族的平等自由，才能握到勝利的旗幟。然後。我們兩萬萬姊妹們，才能有像蘇聯婦女那樣快樂的生活，新興土耳其國婦女那樣自由的生活。</p>
<p>在新年的元旦中，得不應該這樣憂鬰地談出這樣掃興的問題，應該來談談婦女在新年中怎樣尋求快樂，怎樣美容，但我老實想一想，在國難嚴重的今天，我覺得這個婦女的第一個問題，比什麼都還重要，止不住熱情奔放的寫出來。最後，讓我把寄萍先生訪問楊懿煕女士寫下的幾句話，再寫出來，為我一九三七年中國婦女的座右銘：</p>
<p>“婦女解放不能離開民族解放而單獨實現；我們婦女想求解放，就當喚起全國婦女組織聯合戰綫撲滅我們的敵人，封建殘餘和帝國主義。”</p>

<p>國旗要敬愛　失地要收復　遊戲要軍事化　抗敵軍士要援助</p>
<h3>新年占運</h3>
<p>— 陸國維</p>
<p>小朋友們，今天是新年元旦，我們應乘今年的第一天，占卜一下自已的命運，試預知未來一年中的吉凶禍福，我現在有一個有趣的，科學化的占卜算命法介紹給諸位。</p>
<p>下面有五個關於小朋友一年中命運的問題：</p>
<p>一•我今年將有幸福嗎？</p>
<p>二•我今年身體將健康嗎？</p>
<p>三•我今年能升級嗎？</p>
<p>四•我今年會不會遇到意外的災禍？</p>
<p>五•今年那一天是我最快樂的日子？</p>
<p>小朋友看了這五個問題後，可任擇一個你所希望告訴你答案的，譬如你擇第五題“今年那一天是我最快樂的日子，”你可取一枚針，閉了眼，在後面占卜表上任意刺一個小洞，以後張眼看針洞落在那行上，若針洞第一行，便查第一答案表，第二行，便查第答案表，現在假設針洞落在第一行，你便查第一答案表看你以前問的第五題相符的第五答案是什麼？答案是：“國軍削平偽匪的一日便是你最快樂的一天”</p>
<p>下面便是占卜表和答案表</p>
<h3>占卜表</h3>
<h3>第一答案表</h3>
<h3>第二答案表</h3>
<h3>第三答案表</h3>
<h3>家庭座談會</h3>
<p>— 胡野吟</p>
<p>一個家庭中，如果有許多的孩子，通常是認為很麻煩的；因為孩子們大半是喜歡動的，於是一天不是東吵西鬧，便是你和我不和，我和你過不去。大人們呢，覺得這種行動太討厭了，於是大聲呼叱，或動起火來打一頓，於是孩子們哭了呌了，但結果呢，仍等於零；小孩子鬧他們的，任你如何的動火。</p>
<p>我的家庭便是這樣的情形，平時還好，因為他們都去上學去了，星期六星期天眞不得了，簡直吵死人。</p>
<p>為了要解决這樣困難，我便有家庭座談會的提議。辦法是這樣的：規定每星期開一次會，由母親或大孩子主持，不過須要略備茶點，以助雅興。開會的儀式是沒有的，大家都圍在要應裏，由母親設法講一些有益於孩子們的事情，但不可是板起面孔的，要生動有趣：然後要每個孩子說一個故事，或說一個笑話，一個謎語，或唱一曲歌，大家快快樂樂地笑笑，還有茶點可吃。</p>
<p>別看這樣一個小小的家庭座談會，牠的意義却是很大的。這也算是家庭活動之一種，而且含有極深的敎育意味：可以使兒童在談笑學習許多東西，並且可以使他們練習發表言論的能力，因為他們一定先要自己預備好了，然後再來參加，如果他看了一個故事，他重說一遍的時候，他的發表能力便無形中有了練習了。而且母親可以選擇大一些孩子做主席，以造成領袖人才。</p>
<p>在消極方面講：可以使孩子减少頑皮的時候。因為他們要參加這個聚會，他們必先要預備，或找一個故事，一個笑話：……這樣便要費他們許多時間去翻書，去尋找，看書的時候一多，玩皮的時候便少了？</p>
<p>最後，如果一個家庭座談會能主持得好，主持的人可以作有系統的演講，以增加孩子們有組織的智識，這是於家庭敎育有莫大補益的。</p>
<p>我這不過是一個提議，還希望實行的主婦們的指導。</p>
<h3>迎新的年頭</h3>
<p>— 孫競文</p>
<p>又一個年頭來了，小朋友們，誰都增加一歲年紀，你們會感到些甚嗎呢？</p>
<p>沒為福氣進學校的野孩子，是祗會覺得天氣冷，西北風吹得緊，身上的衣服太破了，凍得發抖……什麼又一個年頭來了，他們是茫茫然！</p>
<p>可是幸運的般有書讀的小朋友呢！啊！校裏快要大考了，快要放寒假了。或者也會想起年紀又要大一歲了。……其他是茫茫然。</p>
<p>眞的現在這個時代，不要去說小朋友們，卽是大朋友們！又誰不是茫茫然呢！</p>
<p>新的年頭來到了，什麼“日日新，又日新”的爛調，喊喊是够傷心的！我們怎忍心去欺騙天眞的孩子們，去麻醉孩子們。大家來歡歡喜喜的慶祝新年吧！可憐處在這時代的中國，怎樣的慶法呢！</p>
<p>事實確告訴我們，新的年頭又來了。展開在我們前面的新的年頭，雖然是有些黯淡，不過我們誰都逃避不掉的，誰都要活着的。</p>
<p>無疑的我們應該把這新的年頭好好的過着。</p>
<p>我們都知道，敵人的壓迫我們是一天厲害一天，這新的年頭，是不是亡國的年頭？誰都不敢定。可是如果我們整個民族都有一種覺悟“從戰爭中去求生存”我們可以相信，中國决不會亡的。所以這新的年頭，是不是中華民族復興的年頭？也誰都不敢定。</p>
<p>小朋友們！明白了嗎？新來的年頭，是會决定我們國家的存亡，是會决定我們是否要做奴隸。我們願意中國亡嗎？我們甘心做亡國奴嗎？</p>
<p>我們小孩子們，當然是掮不動槍上前綫去和敵人拚命，不過我們也能够做間接的救亡工作。</p>
<p>新的年頭來到了，我這里談的幾件事，小朋友們應該認清了去做吧！</p>
<p>把你們所知道的時事報告給不識字的人。</p>
<p>激勵你們的父母努力從事救亡的工作。</p>
<p>特別的用功着自己的學業。</p>
<p>特別的關心着國家的大事。</p>
<p>隨時你們應該痛哭呼號，發出你們偉大的天眞的心聲，激發整個民族對敵决戰的勇氣。</p>
<h3>快樂新年</h3>
<p>（一）穿新衣（二）戴新帽（三）作新民</p>
<h3>兒童自由畫</h3>
<h3>不要浪用錢</h3>
<p>— 杜也牧</p>
<p>大年初一的早晨，天空裏掛着一個明亮的溫暖的太陽，這正是小朋友們所開心的事。明兒，智兒，慧兒，美兒，四個人，全都穿了新的衣服，連帽，鞋子，襪子，也都是新的，他們當然是非常快樂的，大家的談話也不像往常一樣，一點都不客氣的，今天全都講得非常有禮貌。</p>
<p>明兒說：“我有四塊大洋，我要買一個大號的洋囝囡。”</p>
<p>智兒說：“我有三塊，我要去買部小脚踏車。”</p>
<p>慧兒說：“我也有三塊，我也要去買一個洋囝囡。”</p>
<p>美兒說：“我什麼都不要，我要去買個大皮球拍！”</p>
<p>說着，大家一陣子的笑了出來，那邊賣小爆竹的擔子挑着來了。啊！那邊賣糖菓的擔子也挑着來啦！</p>
<p>智兒說：“我要買摜砲！”</p>
<p>明兒說：“我要買奶油糖吃！”</p>
<p>正在這末說之間，忽然國兒跳着來了。大家一見國兒來了，都非常歡迎他：“國兒，你來得好呀！我們大家都買一點摜砲，來打仗好嗎？”慧兒這末說。可是美兒說：“我們去買點牛奶糖來，大家來滾銅板好嗎？”明兒跳起來呌道：“好的好的！”</p>
<p>可是國兒說道：“小朋友們！我們中國不是很危險嗎？現在敵軍不是在綏遠攻打我們嗎？小朋友們！我們應該把錢節省下來，捐助前綫抗敵的將士。要曉得，前綫可敬愛的將士們，正在用血用肉在跟敵人搏鬥，我們後方的老百姓，應該也有錢的出錢才好呀，所以我將爸爸媽媽給我的壓歲錢，我都捐去送給前綫抗敵的將士了。將來我們的民族得以自由解放了，那末我們的新年，不是可以更加快樂了嗎？”</p>
<p>大家聽了國兒的話，都認為很對，大家就不浪用金錢了，並且决定把錢省下來，捐給前綫抗敵的將士們。</p>
<h3>站在一條陣線上</h3>
<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>在雲南起義紀念日，卽耶穌復活節的早晨，外國人老老小小，男男女女，都慶祝著，歡迎一九三七年的光臨。但是我們，全國稍有知識的人們，無論老小男女，都正在愁眉苦臉，內心戰慄著，惟恐大難將臨，國家民族，將陷於萬刦不復：萬衆一心期望著西安叛變事件能早一分鐘解决；吾們的領袖能早一分鐘脫險我們國家，我們整個民族，纔得撥去雲霧，重現光明。我們全國老老小小，男男女女，纔得較為舒適地吃年夜飯，歡迎民國二十六年的光臨。</p>
<p>果然那天傍晚，電訊傳來，我們的領袖安然出險，上海全市，頓時爆竹喧天，歡呼匝地，不消說，全中國以至海外全體華僑得到這消息以後，都要熱烈快樂得如醉如狂；更不知有千千萬萬的男女老幼要為之喜極涕零。吾們讀了蔣委員長在西安對張楊的訓話，便是鐵石人也得感動泣下。這一來，轉禍為福，大家庶幾放心過年。</p>
<p>原來這次西安叛變，領袖蒙難，從頭到尾十四天中間，報紙上所報道的消息，顯示的民氣和輿論，足算給我們全民族一個極廣大精密而準確的心理測騐。這十四天中全國上下民衆憤慨緊張，一悲一喜的眞摯表情，一絲一毫都沒有假借造作的。所以有這種一致關切的眞摯表情，都是因為我們全民族這幾年來，受到了從來未有的屈辱，遭遇了各人有生以來未有的嚴重國難。各人心裏都已確切明白，要解除這從來未有的屈辱，要解除這萬分嚴重的國難，除掉遵從我們勞苦奮鬥的最高領袖，站在一條戰線上，和敵人作殊死戰之外，是找不出第二條路徑的。倘使我們民族的戰鬥陣綫，失掉了眞實的領袖，復返到以前一國三公，羣龍無首的局面，那我們自己的陣綫，先已紊亂，那就給敵人不攻自破了。這豈不呌做“自作孽，不可活”嗎？</p>
<p>今天是中華民國二十六年的元旦，我們所能慶祝的，便是我們全民族男女老小，連過去曾經入過歧途的，現在一齊團結起來，向我們政府，向我們領袖，行個“團拜禮，”從今堅决地站在一條陣綫上！</p>
<h3>新年隨感</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>“過了一年又一年，國運至今未轉變！”這兩句話，大概可以代表般人的心理。固然國家的統一，國策的成功；並非一朝一夕的事。但相信我們這個民族，經這麼多年的痛苦，已有相當進步，前途也有一綫曙光。以前人家說：“中國不亡，是無天理！”現在可以改為“中國不亡，自有天理！”</p>
<p>慶祝新年，要有繼往開來的精神，大家反省去年的過失，而定今年的計刻：我將怎樣為自己奮勉改為社會服務？為國家效勞？這便是本位救國的大道。</p>
<p>家庭為國家機構中的細胞，必先組織健全，纔能享受幸福，我未見腐惡的家庭，能產生優秀的公民，故快樂家庭，是推動吾人一切事業的起點；而此種責任，大半負在婦女的肩上。</p>
<p>過去的兒童，只知孝敬父母，現代的兒童，更要愛護國家。你當明白我之生存，是得國家的維護，而國之存亡，全靠人民的力量。所以兒童努力於五育的修養，與其說將來報父母之恩，毋寗說準備盡忠於國家</p>
<p>二十六年起，兒童們應切實負起“小先生”的責任，把求得的智識，卽知卽行的轉告失學的人，自然老師們是“小先生制”的倡導者！</p>

<p>㊂我們一路走，一路敲，越響越好。</p>
<p>㊃哈哈！小黑炭的銅鼓敲破了。</p>
<h3>一個洋囡囡</h3>
<p>— 秦晨</p>
<p>在一個陽光照遍太地的元旦日，雖然時季還不曾跳出冬的範圍，但當風吹在人臉上的時候，都一些不覺得冷；尤其是那些在街上，在院子裏，在屋內奔着，嚷着，亂着的孩子們格外來得興奮，小小的臉兒漲得緋紅，有幾個在淌着汗咧！</p>
<p>K城是遠離大都市的一个僻縣，平時很沉寂，可是一到元旦，空氣頓時也緊張了許多，學校商店扯着國旗，女人，小孩子們換上了新衣服，賣泥人的，畫片，鬼臉兒的都做着很好的賣買，雖然像後石街那樣僻靜的住宅區，也添上了許多的聲音，而大部份却是屬於小孩子的！因為街上從來沒有車馬經過，那些小孩子們便成羣結隊地佔領了全街；有些在齋泥嬤嬤，有些在舞弄刀鎗，有些在扯地鈴，有些在揮動着紙製的小旗，差不多没有一個空着。假使說有的話，那就是小維了！</p>
<p>今天，隣兒們的玩具更多了，挺大的洋銅鼓，怪好聽的小喇叭；凡K城裏所能買得到的玩具全在他面着展開了，但他都不能碰一碰，祇有站在旁邊發呆的份兒。他的唯一的希望就是等晚上媽媽回家，帶一個伊所許給他的鬼臉兒來；然而飯都不曾吃，到夜還有那末許多的時候叫他怎樣耐得住呢？他想大房的五寶平常跟他最好，或者五寶肯把他的小皮球借給他滾一會吧？但他一開口，五寶後做個鬼臉走了，他羞得沒了下場，正要哭出來的時候，忽然從東西來了兩個人，一個挑，一個穿着外國裝的客人，他們向街上的一個老頭兒問幾句話，那志頭兒便望自己一指，這客人主刻狀堆出了笑臉，奔過來抱着他。</p>
<p>“你是小維嗎？媽媽吧？我是你爸爸啊！”這多人很興奮地成着。</p>
<p>小維當然不認識爸爸了！也不知道有一個爸爸：對他有什麼好處，反漲紅着臉要哭了；爸爸知道他陌生，便把夾在他腰下得一個紙包打開了，取出一個眼睛，手脚都會活動的小洋人來，笑嘻嘻地授給他。小維正在發怔的時候，</p>
<p>“一個洋囡囡！一個洋囡囡！”四面的那些孩子全喊起來了。</p>
<p>爸爸便招呼那挑夫把幾件行李挑進屋去，小維也緊緊地抱着那洋囡囡笑了。</p>

<p>— 我</p>
<p>元旦慶祝，原是一篇循例的文章，從民國肇造以來，已度過了二十五個元旦，今年的元旦巳是第二十六個，猶如一個孩子長養到二十六歲，豈不是一件尋常而極平凡的事？</p>
<p>故做元旦慶祝的文章，猶如替人家做壽序，無論其人怎樣，總得寫幾句頌禱的口頭禪和綴幾件勉强而又附會的車跡來恭維恭維；不然，便不像慶祝壽序，更失慶祝的意義了。</p>
<p>自民國成立以來，雖經過了二十五次的元旦，但是都在內憂外患，天災人禍中過日子，即使要胡縐幾句頌禱之詞，也是矯揉造作而不容易體貼切實，不是回顧過去，便是希望未來，這已成為老調的老調。不但寫下去自心不安，即聽者也不免厭倦，但是今年，慶祝有當別論，軋軋實實有三件從來所未有的可慶的事，不得不大書特書，以告讀者。</p>
<p>一是民國統一。統一全國的口號雖巳高唱多時，但是眞正的統－，還未曾達到目的。自去年陳濟棠下野出洋，西南領袖與中央一致合作，全國一心，親如手足，不但政治統一，而亦軍事統一；不但軍事統一，而亦經濟統一，這種局面，實為民國以來未有之好局面，此可慶賀者一。</p>
<p>一收復百靈廟。華北局勢，自九一八以來，被一般土匪漢奸搗亂，幾乎不成其局。去年百靈廟一役，使一般匪偽大受重創，不敢小覷。百靈廟雖為我國固有的領土，但自近年以來，完全為匪偽所盤據，故政令有所不行，近得肉搏奪回，這樣勝利，在民國史上可算第一次大勝利，他日收回失地，恢復國權，亦可操勞，比可慶賀者二。</p>
<p>一蔣委員長脫險回京。此次西安事變，固出我人意料之外，一般人願為蔣委員長危，不意兩星期間，張楊能幡然覺悟，歡送蔣委員長回京，而張亦來京請罪，此不僅全國人民心理的戰勝，抑亦蔣委員長國化之功，有以致之，此覆無妄之災而變成無妄之福，此為歷史上来有的奇蹟，此可慶賀者三。</p>
<p>此外去年全國豐收，萬民樂業，尚不足為可慶的事實，不過以上三種事實，亦豈偶然而致，必定蔣委員長數年來慘澹經營之偉蹟，與深謀遠慮之計劃，有以成之。故以往的成蹟如此，而未來的希望正無窮也。故過去的元旦殊無可賀之點，而今年之元旦，自應舉國同歡，額手稱慶者矣。</p>
<h3>有字不如無字好</h3>
<p>— 靈犀</p>
<p>爆竹一聲除舊；</p>
<p>桃符萬戶更新。</p>
<p>荊楚歲時記：“門旁設設板，以桃木為之，而畫神茶鬰壘象以壓邪，謂之桃符。”因為是三年一換的關係，便成為新年的故事，後來遂以春聯為桃符。</p>
<p>到了萬象更新的新年裹，人間萬事，也該粉刷一下，雖然屋子裹的人，慘得連飯都沒得吃，衣都沒得穿，門面總不能不裝飾裝飾；所以那兩扁大門，無論怎麼髒，無論怎樣腐舊，血紅的春聯，還是不能不貼，如果在新年裹跑上大街小巷，你便可證明我的話並不打誑。若說週而復始之𢓭，萬象眞是更新，那麼這更新，便是應在春聯上了，這也可見中國人的愛在門面上用功夫，比什麼一切都來得看重。</p>
<p>說到春聯，便想起一則典故；但想雖想得起，記却記不清，大約是某一地方，有位士子，在歲尾將盡的時候，鄉人都買了紅紙，很誠懇的去請他寫春聯。也並不推辭，把紅紙都受下，到了除夕，鄉人向他要春聯，他不慌不忙，仍把一捲一捲的紅紙分還了各人，他們把紅紙拿去貼在大門上，一看却連隻字都没有，便去責問那士子，士子笑吟吟答道：“有字不如無字好！”字和事是諧音，中国人天生是怕事的人，誰不願平安無事的過太平年？所以聽了士子的話，覺得口彩很好，便也表示高與感謝。𢓭來據說那地方的春聯，都是沒有字的，成為一種風尚。這個原因，研究起來，我知並非純為口彩，一半也是鄉下人找人寫春聯不易，所以果覺有字不如無字好；本來春聯便是多事的事呢！</p>
<p>新年的報紙上要出特刊，不知是那位好事先生想出來的玩藝兒；所以會寫字的人，便逃不了這個年關，多少要給人緊似債的追去幾個字。其實會執策的人，對於寫幾個字，倒也不如有錢人拔一根毛那樣吝嗇，祇是在這個年頭，字也正不好胡亂寫，往往會寫出亂字筆的。在新年裏，大家要討利市，萬一為了寫字寫出一些麻煩來，豈非觸了一年的霉頭，所以我雖被迫得終於提起筆來，却也猛然想到那位士子，“有字不如無字好”的话，而深覺他所說的，正是我們好動筆的朋友們的戒條。</p>
<p>的確，“有字不如無字好，”你看報紙上不是時常爲了字寫得多了，大不好看，便特地留出一些空白，調和調和讀者的眼力；而讀者也覺得有字不如無字好”，對於留出的空白，會給以更大的興味和注意呢。</p>
<p>因此，我也認為實在有“有字不如無字好”的必要，所以寫了題目之外，不想再寫什麼；上面所寫的，祇是題外文章，說明“有字不如無字好”的一點意思罷了。</p>

<h3>送舊年迎新年</h3>
<p>— 汶</p>
<p>在日曆上撕過了十二月三十一日的最後一頁時，過幾小時，就是一九三七年的開頭了。這－個的過渡，在人們的心理上，會自然被引起一種異樣的感覺。當我們說到“新年”這二個字時，在我們眼前，眞像有一脈“新”的氣象，在等待着我們去接近它。要說“新年眞是值得慶祝的話，那末就在這一點對未來一年的光明的希望上罷。</p>
<p>我曾細想，人們為什麼對於一個年度的交換，抱有如此熱烈的對未來希望之心。那一定是在過去的一年，生活實在不大好。到一年終了，就巴不得過去一年的惡運，也跟着年度的過去一同過去罷。在未來的一年中，總得好好把生活走向幸運中去的。似乎社會間有這樣二句流行的俗話，是：“麻蝦蟆巴（希望也）青天，窮漢巴來年”。照這話的意思，想去麻蝦蟆一定愛着晴天，而厭惡陰雨的。在可厭的多日陰雨之後，它只能空望着晴天趕快到來罷。與這相同，窮漢過了多年的困苦生活，無計可施，只剩到年底希望着明年趕快交好運了。由這俗話說，則人之寄託無窮希望於宋來的新年，正是因為在“舊年”中太不如意之故。這理由是不錯的。</p>
<p>照此而論，我們現在所以對新年的歡迎特別熱烈，正是因為過去一年太不舒服的原因。要詳細的說起來，不舒服的事情就太多啦。大概言之：人對人的壓迫，悲慘的殘殺，無恥的欺騙，響應到個人，生活是一年一年更加困難了……種種的黑暗場面，算是扮演過了已過去的一年。在這四周陰離的氣氛中，受盡苦痛的我們，對於未來的一年，那不人人抱有莫大的希望呢？</p>
<p>希望是並不錯的。只是最大的問題，却不能只是空希望。如麻蝦蟆之望晴天到來，與窮漢之空望明年可交好運，假使我們只以這種無聊的自慰為滿足，那結果一定與窮漢一樣，春去夏來冬又到，永遠只是在悲傷哀悼中度其一個一個的新年。我們的希望，却必得以實際的行為去實現，把希望要架在現實的基礎之上。必得如此，我們的希望才是有益的，可以引導我們出痛苦之深淵，而踏入自由光明之大道。</p>
<p>計算着過去的一年，世界是在痛苦掙扎，血肉與砲彈橫飛之中過去的；在我們切身的周圍，敵人進攻又進了一個階段，漢奸的種種毒策，也遠超於從來的進攻我民族方式之上了。但在另一方面，却又看到了我們民族走向鬥爭的一道光明之路。全国捲起热烈的援綏運動，便是這斗爭場面之一面。我們還要把這日益擴大深入的求生運動，更加展開。使久處於壓迫殘殺下的我們，終能揚起自由之旗，踏在一切被打倒的敵人身上，唱起我們的凱歌。要說“新年”眞是值得慶祝的話，我們就以這一點來寄託其唯一的希望於正在開始的一年罷。</p>
<h3>一九三七年的希望</h3>
<p>— 若英</p>
<p>眞害怕這樣的“搭題”，但又是非寫不可。無巳，就拉雜的條列－些希望，以迎追剛來到的一九三七年罷。</p>
<p>我的希望是：</p>
<p>㊀預言家不要再做第二次大戰在今年爆發的可怕的頂言，這是我們堅决反對的。</p>
<p>㊁希望阿比西尼亞和西班牙能在全世界人民陣綫的支助下，收復他們的失地，鞏國他們的國家。</p>
<p>㊂已經到了忍無可忍的時候，希望抗敵戰爭，馬上能够起來，而且能在這一年內完全把失地收回。</p>
<p>㊃希望中國的大偉人，小百姓，都能在抗敵的旗幟下統一起來，外抗帝國主義，內反封建勢力與漢奸。</p>
<p>㊄希望國防文學，戲劇，電影，有力的帮助救亡陣綫的統一。使我們的作品，更活潑更堅强的成為救亡的號筒。要是匕首，機關槍，迫擊砲，不要是鈍銹的東西。</p>
<p>㊅希望大家努力創作，產生更有內容的作品。要用自己的生活，來豐富並複雜作品的內容。反對自捧，他捧，關門，宗派一切的文壇怪狀。</p>
<h3>我要矯正一句新年套語</h3>
<p>— 溪南</p>
<p>發財！恭喜！</p>
<p>“恭喜！發財！新年相逢，都說這句話可見發財是人人所希望，而人生最大的目的，畢竟為發財。</p>
<p>可是，恭喜發財，還是一點希望之忱。希望，那不能一定成為事實。所以，我要把這句新年套語，倒轉來說，發財！恭喜！”“發財才值得“恭喜，”我們旣把希望的當作現實看，說不定也竟會成了事實。</p>
<p>要把發財成為事實，必須生財有道。那末，其道何由？閱者看到此地，必定要追問一下，且待我道來：</p>
<p>㊀要“有貝之才，”必須有“無貝之才；”有“無貝之才，”才能生“有貝之才。”</p>
<p>㊁要發財，還要看各人的“額角頭，”“額角頭”含有兩種意義；第一種說法，是“額角頭上運氣，”因為走道的人，額角頭上必“亮晶晶，”反之，倒道的人，額角頭上“窰煤起，”但所說“此處的額角頭，”為“亮晶晶”之額角頭，不是“窰煤起”的縮後語。就是說，發財要靠運氣，運氣也可說是機會。第二種說法，發財究竟要用腦筋，腦筋生在額角內。據外國某心理學家說，一個人用腦筋的時候，額上常有跡紋表現出來，雖非目力所能見，也能用特種機械去測量，故所謂“額角頭，”乃是說，要發財，亦有非用腦筋不可的意思在內。</p>
<p>㊂要發財須要有智識。智識從書本中得來。中國人常以財色二字誘惑青年去讀書，（其實可說不是誘惑，乃是投其所好。）說什麼，“書中自有黃金屋，”又說什麼“書中自有顏如玉。”就是說，要滿足你的財色慾望，那你非埋頭讀書不可。</p>
<p>㊃有人說，上面所說的不對，難道讀書就會發財麼！你不見愈讀書，愈見窮，越有智識，越不會發財麼？然而這不能怪讀書，要怪他為什麼頭不尖，體不圓，生成一副寒酸相，祇可擁黃臉婆，住破漏屋，坐着冷板凳，吃盌鹽韲飯，命該如此，有何怨尤。這事所說的黃金屋，顏如玉，是為讀書而能做官的說法。中國各項生意中，最沒有如做官的利重本輕了。雖說儘多廉潔自愛的人。然而嬌妻美妾，舞榭歌台，洋房汽車，所進出的，不少是“禹門三級浪，平地一聲雷”的貴人。所以讀書的祇想做官為最大最好的出路，那肯冒千辛萬苦用本錢去幹那工商實業的了。</p>
<p>㊄有土斯有財，那是一句成語，固然不錯。現在有地皮的亦有土，那末，今年的地皮商，照大勢看去，大可眉飛色舞了。</p>
<p>㊅有財有勢，這是一句諺語，有勢力者所以有財，為了他有勢力，故大家要巴結土去，為了要巴結，所以他即使無財也會有財了。如其有財者無勢，難不說定是怎樣，然而“匹夫無罪，懷璧其罪，”正為了沒有勢力的緣故。所以勢力也是一個發財的最要條件。</p>
<p>歸根一句話，發財才可說恭喜。所以我今年第一次執筆，就要祝讀者發財！恭喜！諸君能發財，那我亦發財了。待我自己亦來恭賀一番！恭喜！恭喜！彼此！彼此！</p>
<h3>新年樂</h3>
<p>— 周木齋</p>
<p>過新年就過新年罷了，事先還要說臨時的話，說苦呢，不合時，觸犯忌諱，說快樂罷，無論怎樣說快樂啊快樂啊，總不快樂，很苦的。假使本不快樂，偏說快樂，舊式的說法，是“强顏為歡”，時髦的說法，是“含淚的笑”，而是適當的例，近乎妓女，一苦也。卽使快樂，先發洩了，倒不如有苦說苦，發洩了快樂，所謂“雖在不言中”，苦和樂是相反的，二苦也。新年，對不相干的人說好話的，給予我的印象，特別是街頭巷尾的，忽焉在前，急焉在後的呌化子，寫文章對讀者，大致可說也是不相干的，而新年說好話，恰巧有現成的名詞，—“文丐”，三苦也。孟子云：“君子有三樂，而王天下不與人焉”。這裏可說小人有三苦了，親小人，遠君子，又一苦也。</p>
<p>說過說苦不合時和觸犯忌諱，却又說說快樂的苦，不合時和觸犯忌諱，是一樣的。然而依照發洩了快樂的意義，“黃連樹下彈琴，苦中作樂，未始不是一得。這年頭兒，熊够有苦說苦，也得。為了事先要說臨時的話，終於有話可說，又得。</p>
<p>但這畢竟是說所以然，自不是說當然。不過還是覺得無話可說，還是“想當然罷。那麼，最好過新年就是過新年，却又須得沒有苦的折扣，或者折扣小些，不要蓋過過新年的快樂。所以其次，過新年說話，要有可以說得合時和不觸犯忌諱的事情。</p>
<h3>五大希望</h3>
<p>— 塵無</p>
<p>又是新年特刊的稿干，對於自己的一年大計，旣有“天棧不可洩漏”之處。還是寫一點對於天下和中國的希望罷。</p>
<p>第一希望世界各大强國，大家都有很多的新殖民地，大家“十分滿足。</p>
<p>第二希望赤色的蘇聯不費各大强國（尤其是德國和日本）吹灰之力，自然坍台，不問是謝米諾夫或則誰某登台，殺史太林，掘列寗墓，使百分之九十工農重為農奴。</p>
<p>第三希望西班牙人民陣綫忽然自己感到自己的不對，跪在馬德里的都門外恭迎希特勒的“玉師。</p>
<p>第四希望德国的台爾曼忽然成了希特勒的信徒？</p>
<p>第五（刪）</p>
<p>好！就這五點希望罷，最後聲明的自然是“我若窮時也不妨”！</p>
<h3>寄給朋友的一個短氣</h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>×：來信收到了。提起筆來寫回信，猛然記起今天已經是除夕的前夜，禁不住微微一驚，心也竟有些凉起來了。</p>
<p>又是一年！我們聽見我的靈魂這樣地呌了一聲，那聲音是暗啞而沉重。我辨不清這四個字是什麼意義。時間對於人類，自然很值得寶貴，它曾經手造文明，也無情地摧毀舊的世界；但歷史的路這樣遼遠，我們生活在這悲劇的時代中，所扮演的又祇是無足重輕的角色，一大串可貴的日子，就像嚼著鷄肋那样，在毫無意味的愁煩與疲乏中打發過去，偶然一清醒，想想這种情形，我的靈魂就被毒蛇噬着一樣地痛楚起来了。</p>
<p>這一年裏面，我耗損了三百幾十天的生命的代價，無論對人對己，究竟得到了一點什麼呢？</p>
<p>我的性情，你大概總能够理解，相信我還不是這樣自私糊塗的人。我願意自己生活得有意羲一點，假如我的手和腦對於這時代也可以盡一點推進的力，我也願意貢獻出我的一切。但壓在我身上的，却是一副沉重的生活的担子，我的有限的青春，祇能埋葬在這種平凡猥瑣的歲月裏面。朋友，你替我想想，這是社會加於我們的多麼殘酷的刑罰！</p>
<p>聽說你過了年就要到北平去，這消息給了我一點悵惘。但我想，你有機會未跑一次也好。侷促在古舊的小城中，度着止水般平靜的生活，也許是一種幸福，不過我總覺得這樣是生命的浪費。北平，那苟全在敵人鐵蹄下的“文化城”中，你也許可以多看見一點什麼。過了年，因為歲月的轉移，希望你也要敢起來，把生活改變一下吧。</p>
<p>這幾天心情很壞，一提筆，就發了這許多牢騷。不過，×，請你放心，生活的勇氣我還是有的，我也並不悲觀。以後我也許還能够變得要堅實些。希望你也給我鼓勵。</p>
<p>預計你收到這封信的時候，正是新年的開始，那麼，讓我在這裏來預祝你“新年快樂”吧。</p>
<p>臨書倉卒，不盡所懷。冬寒凜冽，並希珍重！</p>
<h3>寫給自己</h3>
<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>元旦感言</p>
<p>連今年，我在上海一共過了兩個新年。</p>
<p>去年在元旦那天，我記得曾寫下如下的一段：“……每個人從下每胎起，都要吃飯，住房子和睡覺的，換句話說</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 37</h2>
<h2>Page 38</h2>
<h2>Page 39</h2>
<p>：都需要生活。要不是糊塗虫的話，我想他們都應該想一想：從元旦這一天起，要怎樣去計劃生活。地主和農夫所計劃的，也許是想多買幾畝田地，多種幾擔穀物，在可能的範圍，就多買頭耕牛。至於自已呢？不是地主，也不是農民，沒有那樣多的計劃，只有一個願望：少說話，多做事。……”</p>
<p>整整十二個月，我根據了這不侈的這條去和生活搏斗，好像一匹在怒濤中波蕩的孤舟。雖然有時也曾有過躍起的怒潮向這孤舟打擊着，有時也曾有陣風暴企圖把它吹翻，壓下海底。然而，這孤舟掙扎着，蕩開激怒的波濤。在遼闊，不寧靜的海面上，在陰次，悶人的夜里，摸索地爬行着，朝向黎明的那方。現在，我已安穩地渡過旅程中的某一段落了，而且又着手來替自已定下第二道航綫。</p>
<p>當日歷一頁一頁的被翻走，扯去，我底心總有一種異樣的感覺，落寞而且悽涼的。我常常的問着自已：“日子又過去一天了，年青人，在人生的旅途上，你底生命也短小一天，然而，你做了些什麼呢？”我常常慚愧着，虽然在這一年中，倒也做了不少事情，讀過相當可觀的書，文章也還寫點。然而，我從來沒曾滿意過自已，有時我抱着競競的精神和爆炸的心，拿着筆書寫着。可是當自已回頭看了第二道時，就禁不住感到絕望起來了，我沒有寫下了自已想寫的那些話。這樣，我相信着自已是整個地失敗了。</p>
<p>兩年前，在南方一個僻靜的村落里，每當夜闌人靜時，我常常陷入夢幻般的冥想，我不斷地想着沙漠，想荷着重負跋涉的駱駝，接著就好像有一種聲音附在自已底耳朵旁，低低的說道：“就做隻駱駝吧！”這聲音常常在我底耳朵里響着，蠱惑我，終於我決定了，帶了一身泥土氣和一隻破提箱，像駱駝似的踏上黃浦灘，又像駱駝似的生活着，充滿了剛勇和希望，不知道疲備，也不知道有失敗。但是，現在我開始懷疑着這種精神是否還在。做駱駝的信心有點搖動了。</p>
<p>“……好好的生活下去，年青人你底前途是有的。”這是朋友給我的鼓勵</p>
<p>從今年起，我覺得自已更須鎭定下去，少說話，多做事，不使朋友失望，也不要使自已灰心。</p>
<h3>元旦無感二章</h3>
<p>— 萬秋</p>
<p>年小的時候，元旦來了，忙着穿新衣戴花帽；年漸長，元旦來了，忙着接待佳賓，談心敘舊；在國外的時候，元旦來了，每興故國之思，不免西望惆悵。每一個時期，每一個時期，都有過那一時期對於元旦的感興，雖然那感興是各有不同。</p>
<p>可是近年來，入了祉會，生活要靠自己的腦力與體力來維持，一切美好的夢境都消失了，冷冰冰的現實擺在眼前，新年也好，舊年也好，除夕也好，元旦也好，沒有米不能成炊，沒有錢一日也不能過活，年與不年竟至毫無分別，所以現在變成元旦無感也。（古無感章之一）</p>
<p>這無感其實不限於元旦，就是日常生活也是如此。在學校讀書的時候，眼前常常有着希望無窮的夢境，生活裹而常常含有若干詩意，於是寫寫小說，詠詠詩歌的興味會便湧出來了。可是現在呢，看的書是文字，看稿子也是文字，甚至於朋友見面談天都還脫不出這些“文字”的範圍，好像食傷的人一樣，一看見文字我的胃口便有些脹了。自己執筆寫文字的興味從何而起呢？所以我願奉勸有志創作的朋友們，切不可選擇當編輯這門職業。一做了編輯，是要减殺創作力量的。（右無感章之二）</p>
<p>今年是牛年，希望我們四萬萬的同胞用出牛一樣的力氣把我們中國拉進現代國家的園地。</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Petitions the National Government for Special Pardon of Zhang Xueliang</h3>
<p>The Military Affairs Commission's Higher Military Court Held a Trial Yesterday at the Commission and Immediately Rendered a Verdict: Zhang Sentenced to Ten Years Imprisonment and Deprivation of Civil Rights for Five Years</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Following the Central Government's decision to hand Zhang Xueliang over to the Military Affairs Commission for legal proceedings, the Commission specially formed a trial committee, with Li Liejun as the presiding judge. The trial was completed on the 31st, and Zhang was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for five years. The facts and reasons for the verdict were announced on the evening of the 31st. It is reported that Chairman Chiang, believing Zhang had shown early signs of remorse, has petitioned the government for a special pardon. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After Zhang Xueliang came to Nanjing to await punishment, the Central Government decided to hand him over to the Military Affairs Commission for legal proceedings. The Commission dispatched Li Liejun, Zhu Peide, and Lu Zhonglin to interrogate him according to the law. The interrogation began at 10:00 AM on the 31st. Zhang Xueliang, accompanied by Song Ziwen, arrived at 9:45 AM. After being interrogated separately by Li Liejun and others for one and a half hours, Zhang Xueliang went to the Kong residence. It is reported that the Military Affairs Commission has reported the interrogation process to the Central Government and will announce it immediately. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the Xi'an Incident, the National Government, based on Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's submission of Zhang Xueliang's plea of guilt, ordered the Military Affairs Commission to handle the case according to the law. The Military Affairs Commission then appointed Li Liejun as the presiding judge, Zhu Peide and Lu Zhonglin as judges, and military legal officers and clerks to form a Higher Military Court. The court opened at 10:00 AM on the 31st at the Commission, and the trial and verdict were rendered immediately. Zhang Xueliang was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for five years. The verdict was then submitted to the National Government for approval. The full text of the verdict is recorded below:</p>
<p>Military Affairs Commission Higher Military Court Verdict</p>
<p>Verdict: Defendant Zhang Xueliang,</p>
<p>The defendant listed above, for the case of violence and coercion against a superior officer, has been tried by the Higher Military Court organized by this Commission, and the verdict is as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang, as the chief instigator and accomplice, committed violence and coercion against a superior officer, is sentenced to ten years of imprisonment with reduction, and deprivation of civil rights for five years.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>In December of the 25th year of the Republic of China, this Committee member, fearing Chiang Kai-shek, went from Luoyang to Shaanxi on official business and stayed in Lintong. At dawn on the 12th, Zhang Xueliang led his troops to intercept and hold him in Xi'an, forcing Chairman Chiang to accept his demands for reorganizing the government. At that time, Central Committee member Shao Yuanchong, Third Group Leader of the Adjutant's Office Jiang Xiaoxian, Secretary Xiao Naihua, and many other adjutant staff and guards who accompanied the delegation to Shaanxi on official business, as well as Yang Zhenya, the head of the Shaanxi Gendarmerie Regiment, were killed when they resisted. Qian Dajun, the director of the Adjutant's Office, was also shot and wounded. Furthermore, senior officials in Shaanxi, including Chen Diaoyuan, Jiang Zuobin, Zhu Shaoliang, Shao Lizi, Jiang Dingwen, Chen Cheng, Wei Lihuang, Chen Jicheng, and Wan Yaohuang, were all detained. Zhang Xueliang was often reprimanded by Chairman Chiang, and soon repented. On the 25th of the same month, he accompanied Chairman Chiang back to Nanjing to plead guilty. After the incident first occurred, the National Government ordered this Commission to handle the case strictly. Now, Zhang Xueliang's plea of guilt has been received by this Commission. After the Higher Military Court was organized and the trial concluded, the facts are determined as above.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>The defendant in this case, Zhang Xueliang, led troops to intercept and hold the commander-in-chief, forcing him to accept his demands for reorganizing the government. This is evidenced by the defendant's telegrams. The killing of officials and detention of generals are all public facts. Although these actions were carried out by his subordinates, it is clear that the defendant was the instigator and should bear the responsibility for the crime. His actions constitute offenses under Article 67, Section 2, first part of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law, Article 271, Section 1 and Section 2, and Article 302, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. However, considering that the crimes he committed were a single act that violated multiple criminal charges, or that the method and result of committing one crime violated other criminal charges, Article 15 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law and Article 55 of the Criminal Law should be invoked to apply the heavier punishment from Article 67, Section 2, first part of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law. However, the defendant, after being reprimanded by Chairman Chiang, showed repentance and accompanied him back to Nanjing to plead guilty. Considering his circumstances, he is not entirely unforgivable. Therefore, in accordance with Article 59 of the Criminal Law, the punishment under Article 67, Section 2, first part of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law is reduced to ten years of imprisonment. In accordance with Article 37, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, he is deprived of civil rights for five years. This is the verdict as stated in the main text. December 31st, 25th year of the Republic of China. Military Affairs Commission Higher Military Court. Presiding Judge: Li Liejun. Judges: Zhu Peide, Lu Zhonglin. Military Legal Officers: Chen Enpu, Qiu Yuqin. Clerk: Yuan Zuxian. Recorder: Guo Zuomin. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek learned of the verdict of the Military Court on Zhang Xueliang's case on the 31st, considering that the legal aspects had already been mitigated as much as possible according to the provisions of the law, there was no further room for leniency. However, given Zhang Xueliang's sincere repentance, courage to reform, and respect for the nation in surrendering himself for punishment, his situation was indeed pitiable. Therefore, he immediately submitted a petition to the National Government requesting a special pardon and asking that he be ordered to atone for his crimes through meritorious service. The petition was delivered to the National Government at 2:00 PM. The original petition is excerpted below: Petition for a Petition. It is humbly submitted that the Xi'an Incident was caused by Zhang Xueliang, the Deputy Commander of the Northwest Bandit Suppression, who was misled by others and lightly violated national laws and regulations, engaging in reckless actions. Afterward, he felt awe of virtue and authority and suddenly realized his mistakes. He personally went to the capital to submit a written plea of guilt. The esteemed government ordered the Military Affairs Commission to assess the situation according to the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law and impose a sentence of ten years of imprisonment. The law has been fully applied, and the crime and punishment are appropriate. The lenient reduction in punishment already demonstrates magnanimity. As I, Zhongzheng, am burdened with guilt, I dare not make any further entreaties. However, I believe that when discussing matters, one should pursue the utmost, and when enforcing the law, one should not neglect the application of benevolence. The state establishes criminal laws to deter the wicked and establish principles to await repentance. This time, the official was deluded and greatly violated the criminal code. News of the incident spread, and the entire nation was outraged. If he were to continue in his wickedness and stubbornly repeat his perverse actions, the state would not hesitate to punish him, but the nation's vitality would be further depleted. Fortunately, he quickly returned from the wrong path and repented in time. Observing his tearful confession to me personally, I know that his conscience was aroused, and he still values the nation. Due to a shift in his thoughts, he reversed the fate of the entire situation. Considering the original circumstances, it seems appropriate to seek a pardon. Today, the nation faces many difficulties, and there is an urgent need for talented individuals to stabilize the situation. The official is young and strong and has long been in the military. Through this grave mistake, he should gain a thorough understanding. If he is given a chance to redeem himself, it is hoped that he can still contribute. It seems unwise to abandon him outright and not provide an opportunity for improvement. In the past, our Premier punished chaos and hated evil, strictly enforcing the law, but he also pardoned transgressions and practiced benevolence, showing even greater tolerance. The Central Government's compassion for the guilty should further move the world. Therefore, without fear of blame, I offer my humble opinion, respectfully requesting the esteemed government to consider the official's courage to repent, strict adherence to national laws, and self-submission to punishment. Based on the Provisional Constitution, may benevolence be extended further, granting a special pardon for the crimes the official should receive and ordering him to atone for his crimes through meritorious service, striving for self-redemption, looking forward to future effects, and demonstrating exceptional benevolence. Whether this is feasible, a document is prepared and respectfully submitted for your review and implementation. Respectfully presented to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chiang Kai-shek respectfully presented. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

According to Mou, since Chairman Chiang left Xi'an, the opinions expressed in local newspapers such as the Liberation Xi'an Daily are extremely absurd.

<h3>Business Situation in Tianjin Declines</h3>

However, those engaged in these industries are still unable to make a profit. The bleak situation will become even more apparent as the end of the year approaches. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Proclamation to the Nation from the Central Propaganda Department</h3>
<p>The New Year's Day of the 26th year holds a uniquely grand and new significance; henceforth, we shall advance along the two paths of self-reliance and the eradication of bandits and traitors.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The full text of the New Year's Day proclamation to all comrades and compatriots, issued by the Central Propaganda Department in the twenty-sixth year, is recorded below: Today marks the twenty-sixth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China and also coincides with the return to Nanjing of our Party leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, after his ordeal. In recent days, the ardent enthusiasm of our people for rejoicing and comfort, and the grand scenes of celebrations and odes from various regions, are truly unprecedented in historical records. From now on, the Republic of China, which we have created with such hardship, is akin to surviving a calamity and seeing the light of day again. At the beginning of this year, we usher in boundless hope. The joy is extraordinary. Therefore, this year's New Year's Day, in addition to the customary celebrations, holds a uniquely grand and new significance. Recalling the past year, the country's path was fraught with difficulties, and there was no peaceful day. As the year drew to a close, the Xi'an Incident occurred. Fortunately, public opinion was aroused, and, inspired by the personality and sincerity of our leader, the Central Government's response and decision to quell the unrest was appropriate. With the loyal and courageous efforts of armed comrades, the great calamity was quelled in less than half a month. The leader of the Party and the nation, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, safely returned amidst the nation's love and the world's admiration. Even the instigators of the initial rebellion deeply expressed their sincerity in repenting and awaited punishment. The dark clouds were swept away. Therefore, our people are encouraged and joyful to celebrate this annual New Year's Day, and no one can restrain themselves. The incident on December 12th of last year was indeed a matter of life and death for our nation's five-thousand-year history, a turning point for the survival of the Republic of China, and a watershed in the character of our nation. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has already spoken of this with great emotion in his address. The course of this incident is sufficient to prove that the foundation of our national unity is indeed solid, that the collective strength of the entire nation has indeed taken shape, and that the concern of our compatriots for national affairs and their support for the leader of our Party are also recognized by the world. In particular, our leader's benevolent and great personality, his steadfast and calm spirit in responding to the crisis, and his dedication to serving the country for more than a decade have become even clearer and more evident to the world. Tracing back to the decades of revolution by our Party, the reason we have braved countless dangers and overcome countless difficulties is none other than this consistent spirit, which has brought us to this day. All the dangers and difficulties in the revolutionary process have not been enough to shake our Party's unwavering belief and the great cause built by our leader with diligence. Even those who have turned against us have ultimately had to submit to the judgment of our Party's justice, the leader's personality, and the nation's public opinion. Our leader's sincerity, even the advocacy of the Red bandits could not obstruct, the coercion of enemy bullets could not deter, the cunning schemes of traitors could not implement, and the unusual actions of rebels could not bend. This further provides a firm and definite proof. We firmly believe that the hidden dangers within the country will henceforth be eliminated (at the same time, all the misleading statements that attempt to confuse people's minds and shake the foundation of the nation will also collapse without being attacked and disappear without being refuted. Under the interaction of our Party's justice and national consciousness, there is no reason for any conspiracy or unusual action to succeed by chance, as can be seen from this incident. We further believe that the greatest crisis for the nation has been safely overcome, that the revival and construction of a new China can proceed smoothly, and that our nation's self-confidence has become even stronger and deeper. At this grand festival, as we reflect on the past and look forward to the future, we respectfully present the paths of our common efforts in the future, in order to encourage our comrades and to look forward to mutual encouragement with our compatriots throughout the country.</p>
<p>In the future, the work of our Party will resolutely advance along the following paths. On the active front, we must unite internal forces to consolidate the foundation of unity, rectify discipline to establish the pattern of the rule of law, and cultivate national strength to engage in the preparation for restoration. In a word, it is "self-reliance." On New Year's Day last year, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek announced to the people the way of saving the country by saving ourselves, saying, "As long as the people of the whole country can strengthen their national self-confidence and truly become self-reliant and strong, our country will surely be restored." Over the past year, the Central Government's domestic measures have all been based on the above principles and have been universally recognized by the people. As for the way to achieve this, on the one hand, we must continue to vigorously implement the New Life Movement so that the moral spirit of our country can be nurtured and implemented in daily life, including clothing, food, housing, and habits, to establish the personality of the entire nation and create a new life for the people. On the other hand, we must strive to promote the National Economic Construction Movement to develop the people's ability to create and labor, increase the resources of the people's lives, thereby improve the people's economic life, and complete the material construction of the country. The former focuses on the spirit, and the latter focuses on material matters. The two complement each other and cannot be abandoned. If both sides can advance together and strive tirelessly, the national strength will be enriched, and the national restoration can be expected soon. Secondly, the most important task on the passive front is to intensify the planned work of eliminating bandits and traitors to eliminate the source of domestic unrest. Regarding this, our Party has repeatedly and earnestly informed the people of the country. Today, the existence of Red bandits in China cannot be tolerated, which is a universally recognized iron rule. As for the traitors who recognize the enemy as their father and are willing to be accomplices, they are still on the list to be eliminated, so there is no need to explain further. Therefore, we must eradicate their roots to unify the national steps of resisting foreign aggression and saving the country. In summary, the way to save the country and seek survival today lies in using the collective strength of the entire nation to consolidate the unity of the country internally and to seek the country's survival, freedom, and equality externally. At this time of reversal, all our people must be diligent and vigilant and must not be complacent for a moment. If we can exhaust the wisdom and talent of our four hundred million people to work together towards the great mission of saving the country and seeking survival, then the achievements in the future will surely surpass any country and any nation. This is what we must deeply recognize at the turning point from danger to safety and from weakness to strength.</p>
<p>Now, the border troubles are intensifying, the remnant bandits have not been pacified, and difficulties are everywhere. It is not yet the time for our people to fully celebrate. It is hoped that from now on, the entire country will concentrate its strength, unify its steps, and move towards the above-mentioned paths together, so that our country can become a bright and splendid modern country, and that our people can cultivate a happy and lively national character. This is not only the fortune of the people but also the fortune of the Party and the country.</p>
<p>(1) Eliminate internal traitors and resist foreign aggression. In recent years, foreign forces have been invading, and the situation has worsened. Resisting foreign aggression and seeking survival has become a unanimous understanding throughout the country. However, if the national traitors are not eliminated, the collective strength of the national struggle cannot be formed. Today's puppet Manchukuo traitors and the remaining Red bandits all want to collude with foreign forces to realize their wild ambitions and endanger the country. Their intentions are all the worst of national traitors. Therefore, we must eradicate their roots to solidify the internal foundation of the nation. Ensuring internal security is the way to resist foreign aggression, and eliminating traitors is the way to defend against foreign aggression. The recent Xi'an Incident further proves the correctness of this theory. Therefore, suppressing the Red bandits and eliminating internal traitors is the key to saving the country at present. At the same time, we must also resist the harassment of bandits and puppets with all our strength to secure our borders. This requires our comrades and compatriots throughout the country to work together, encourage each other, and support the government's promotion.</p>
<p>(2) Fulfilling responsibilities and completing construction. The fundamental belief in saving the country lies in self-reliance. The concrete realization of self-reliance lies in completing the construction of both spiritual and material aspects. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said, "We must use the New Life Movement to lay the foundation of the country's moral and spiritual foundation, and at the same time, we must use the National Economic Construction Movement to complete the country's economic construction." He also said, "As long as everyone does what they can do, strengthens themselves tirelessly, no matter how critical the country is, it can be saved within a year." These words are indeed true. If our compatriots throughout the country can each hold a sincere heart to save the country, deeply understand their own responsibilities, follow Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, follow their duties, practice what they preach, and devote their loyalty and knowledge to their assigned duties, then the great cause of restoration can be achieved, and the revival of national fortune is not far away.</p>
<p>(3) Concentrating will and unifying steps. The work of resisting foreign aggression and saving the country must first unify the will of the whole country, concentrate the strength of the whole country, accept the guidance of the Central Government, adhere to consistent views, be well-coordinated, and make every effort to succeed. Otherwise, indecision will lead to chaos and failure. For a year, the internal unity of our Party has been solid, and the political views of all parties have also become consistent. The people throughout the country have also expressed enthusiastic trust in the measures of the Central Government. This is a symbol of national progress. It is hoped that our patriotic comrades and compatriots throughout the country can all establish the great ambition of saving the country, accept the guidance of the government, and be able to identify and criticize all heresies that endanger the country, in order to achieve the effect of rectifying the source.</p>
<p>The above three points are only a brief overview of my personal feelings for the sake of mutual learning. As for the intention of building the country and saving the country, and the great plan of reviving and defending against foreign aggression, the Central Government already has a definite policy. I hope that our comrades and compatriots will deeply understand and work together. This is what I wish to encourage and strive for with the comrades of our Party and the compatriots throughout the country. (Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>New Year's Holiday for Banks and Money Shops in Beijing</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Banks in Beijing traditionally take a three-day holiday for the New Year. Since the 3rd is Sunday, it was decided to take an additional day off on the 4th, and business will resume as usual on the 5th. The Central Bank has decided to take the same four-day holiday as other banks. According to the Money Shop Association, all money shops will take a three-day holiday from the 1st to the 3rd and will resume business as usual on the 4th. It was also decided that the money market during the holiday period should be the same as the market price on the 31st. The banks' year-end closing accounts and settlements should be completed on the same day. As it is the end of the month and the New Year, the bill exchange house of the banking industry is very crowded with exchanged bills. The exchange time was extended by one hour in the second session. A total of 953 bills were exchanged today, amounting to 5,214,504 yuan and 82 cents, an increase of more than 2 million yuan compared to usual. According to the banking industry, the financial situation this year is similar to that of the previous year. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the financial situation has stabilized, and various speculative businesses have been invisibly curbed. Although the Xi'an Incident suddenly arose recently, the financial situation was not affected. The business nature of banks in Beijing is different from that in Shanghai, so the annual business situation always stands on the horizontal line. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<h3>New Year's Reflections</h3>
<p>— Kong Xiangxi</p>
<p>The year is renewed, and the beginning is auspicious. The New Year's Day of the 26th year is coming again. Looking back to the beginning of the founding of the Republic of China, stubborn ideas and evil forces permeated the whole country and were not easy to eliminate. After more than ten years of turmoil, although countless martyrs sacrificed and fought bravely, the revolutionary doctrine and national strength still failed to be fully demonstrated to the world. Since Chairman Chiang was ordered to launch the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year, and soon after quelled the whole country and established the capital in Nanjing, the National Government was able to be established. This has been more than ten years now. Over the past ten years, externally, there has been strong oppression, seizing our borders, economic aggression, shaking the market; internally, there has been rampant banditry, incessant wars, financial exhaustion, and the collapse of the countryside. Every day has been spent in the midst of stormy seas. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, our compatriots throughout the country have adhered to the established national policy of the Central Government, worked together, struggled arduously, and endured humiliation to strengthen the country. Only then have we achieved today's results. Let's look at the situation in the twenty-fifth year. The central government's decrees are being implemented throughout the country, and the cause of unification is nearing completion. Various constructions are advancing steadily, finance is stable, production is increasing, popular education is gradually becoming widespread, and the spirit of resisting foreign aggression is unanimous throughout the country. The country and the nation have entered the path of rejuvenation. The international community has also changed its old views. We are greatly gratified. Unexpectedly, on December 12th, there was another shocking incident in Xi'an. At that time, China and foreign countries were shocked, as if a great disaster was about to come, and they were uneasy all day long. Fortunately, the perpetrators quickly repented of their mistakes. Chairman Chiang safely returned to Nanjing on the 25th. The dark clouds were swept away. During this short period, we silently observed the various responses from all parties since the incident occurred, as well as the enthusiastic emotions of the people in support. We deeply felt that today's China is no longer the China of the past; and the hope of national rejuvenation will undoubtedly use this incident as a touchstone. When the incident occurred, there were sudden difficulties in politics and military affairs. If the government organization had been slightly unsound, it would have inevitably led to panic and shaken the overall situation. However, the Central Government responded to the Shaanxi Incident, decisively, safeguarding the safety of the leader on the one hand and adhering to the established national policy on the other, calmly and steadily, without surprise. This is sufficient to prove that the organization of the central authorities is solid.</p>
<p>Political changes are most likely to affect finance. Since the reform of the currency system, the reserves have been sufficient, the foreign exchange rate has been stable, and the credit of the legal tender has long been demonstrated at home and abroad. The occurrence of this incident depended on the close cooperation of the financial community at home and abroad with the government, so the market was able to be stable, as usual. This is sufficient to prove that the foundation of finance is stable.</p>
<p>The central and local governments were originally one body. After the Shaanxi Incident, military and civilian officials in various provinces sent messengers one after another, unanimously supporting the central government and rescuing the leader. Regarding various government affairs, they were still able to proceed as usual, maintain law and order, and spare no effort. This is sufficient to prove that the unity between the local and central governments is strong.</p>
<p>Intellectuals are the role models for the people. This time, professors from various universities and academic groups upheld justice and spoke out in righteousness, so that the public opinion of right and wrong was as clear as the sun and moon in the sky. This is sufficient to prove that the direction of political learning is consistent.</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of this incident, from the agricultural, industrial, and commercial circles to the porters, everyone has been running around and calling for the rescue of the leader. On the day Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing, cheers resounded throughout the country, and everyone came out of sincerity. The inseparable relationship between the safety of individuals and the country, and the survival of the leader and the nation, has been deeply imprinted in everyone's minds. This is sufficient to prove that the people's knowledge has progressed.</p>
<p>Since the loss of the Northeast, our country's international status has been getting worse and worse. Until last year, when the country was unified, international public opinion gradually changed. After the occurrence of this incident, people from all walks of life in various countries expressed their deep sympathy for Chairman Chiang, and praised the government's calm response. This is sufficient to prove that the international status has increased.</p>
<p>After the Xi'an Incident occurred, all the generals in the country were filled with righteous indignation, and they were eager to volunteer to go to the front. Those who were transferred to the front had an especially intense mood of courageously rushing to the rescue. This is sufficient to prove that the generals and soldiers were eager to serve.</p>
<p>The soldiers guarding the borders were loyal, brave, and patriotic, and repeatedly built miraculous deeds. After this incident occurred, they still maintained their spirit of shared hatred against the enemy and continued to fight bravely. The replenishment of the rear and the consolation of the front lines were not relaxed due to the Shaanxi Incident. This is sufficient to prove that the spirit of resisting foreign aggression has been thoroughly implemented.</p>
<p>A small number of troops in Xi'an were temporarily confused,劫持the commander, and were blamed by the whole country with great righteousness, and moved by the sincerity of Chairman Chiang. They knew that their behavior was wrong, and they were misled by the agitation of the reactionaries. They could not be tolerated by the people, and they soon regretted their mistakes and submitted sincerely, and礼送Chairman Chiang back to Beijing,束身待罪. This is sufficient to prove that the agitation of the reactionaries was ineffective.</p>
<p>Since the incident, the whole country has shown its true sincerity in protecting the national leader, promoting justice, and denouncing criminals. The propaganda of the public opinion circles has been especially diligent. The central government's planes scattered京沪various newspapers in the sky over Xi'an, awakening the misguided dream of the trouble makers, and achieving rapid results. This is sufficient to prove that the power of public opinion is great.</p>
<p>All of the above facts are present. After our pain, we saw these good phenomena and could not help but feel surprised and overjoyed. The strength of our country and nation has gradually been revealed to the world, and Chairman Chiang's ten years of hard work, enduring hardships, and sacrificing himself to save the country and nation has been somewhat gratifying. As the saying goes, worry inspires sages and the crowing of chickens makes a nation prosperous. From now on, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, our entire country should be more diligent and vigilant, continue to work hard, and implement this spirit of loving the country and loving the leader, and complete the great cause of reviving the nation. There are two points that we deeply expect. (1) Struggle for self-reliance. The modern nations that can survive in the world all rely on the brilliance and greatness of their own national strength, so that they can be connected with other nations and jointly maintain world peace. There is no reason to rely on other forces and be able to survive. The Chinese nation has a history of thousands of years. The root cause of the disease is that individual concepts are important and national concepts are light, lacking strict organization and profound training. Therefore, although there are virtues of being able to endure hardship, the power is scattered and cannot be concentrated, and sitting and making mistakes almost led to the disaster of national subjugation. Observing the Sui Bian campaign and the Xi'an Incident, once the national strength is expressed, it can resist foreign aggression and eliminate internal worries. If we add tempering and unite the spirit of progress, so that the national strength will not be dispersed and will be fully expressed on the way to save the country, then the glory of the nation's future can be predicted.</p>
<p>(2) Firm belief in the central doctrine, and support孙总理's三民主主义and the restoration of national morality, as the guide for saving the country. The reason why Chairman Chiang is able to win the support of the people today is that he abides by总理's legacy, puts it into practice, and there is no other way. Therefore, the people who truly support Chairman Chiang do not only support individuals, but also support this central doctrine of saving the country. They do not only complete the matter by supporting it, but everyone must firmly believe in this doctrine and put it into practice. No matter what kind of异说,凡is against the central doctrine, not to be shaken in the slightest, then the hundreds of millions of hearts in the country are united, and no strong force can destroy it. The revival of the country can be achieved through hard work. This is what we have unlimited hope for in addition to欣慰.</p>
<p>When the Xi'an Incident was launched,祥熙was recuperating in Shanghai. Because he was奉中央决议,he temporarily presided over院务during Chairman Chiang's离京period. That night,he 力疾returned to Beijing,任重材轻, and originally did not dare to荷此巨责. Only because he was束发受书, he knew the great meaning of this, and when the党国危亡, he had to勉任其难.以来浹句, all internal and foreign affairs were in accordance with the established national policy, and continued to be carried out, fortunately without贻误. This is all due to the sincere support of my colleagues in the政院and 长官in various places, and the unanimous support of the compatriots throughout the country for the Central Government and the government's trust, which is even more commendable. Now that Chairman Chiang has fortunately returned to Beijing and continues to preside over the great plan,祥熙 can take some responsibility and still follow behind his colleagues and help each other through difficult times under his leadership. Now that it is the beginning of the year, I will briefly offer a year-end speech to show my compatriots in the country, and to express my gratitude to all parties for their support and concern. I hope you will understand.</p>

<p>Tokyo Correspondence</p>
<h3>On the Japanese Coup (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Nan Yun</p>
<p>Due to diplomatic failures and the non-realization of "renewal of all government affairs," although the budget proposal has been passed in the cabinet meeting, it is still subject to review by the parliament. Therefore, Japanese newspapers and magazines have recently been enthusiastically fortune-telling for Hirota.</p>
<p>However, the party cabinet was long ago rejected by the military, and good old men who are unwilling to listen to the military's orders are also unable to form a cabinet. Now is only a quasi-wartime situation; before the outbreak of a major war, who would be suitable to form a cabinet? Most Japanese political commentators guess that the cabinet after Hirota will be the Ugaki cabinet, because Ugaki is from the military and is also a first-rate expert in governing colonies, and there are many supporters of Ugaki in various political parties. However, many young officers in the military are dissatisfied with Ugaki. The "February 26th Incident" was launched by these young officers. If they are not appeased, Ugaki may not dare to "receive the great mandate." Today's Speaker of the House of Peers, Prince Konoe, also dared not accept the recommendation of Elder Saionji because he was not confident in dealing with the military. Otherwise, the first cabinet after the "February 26th Incident" would have been the Konoe cabinet, not the Hirota cabinet.</p>
<p>Today's Hirota cabinet is neither a party cabinet nor a noble cabinet, but a bureaucratic cabinet that obeys the military. The military understands very well that bureaucrats only care about having official positions. Obeying eight parts and resisting two parts is the true nature of bureaucrats. Using their eight parts of obedience to complete wartime preparations, and their two parts of resistance happen to serve as a buffer zone between the military and political parties. An unprecedented budget of more than 3.04 billion yuan was passed in the cabinet meeting in just one and a half hours. This could not have been done without Hirota's bureaucratic cabinet, right?</p>
<p>The military cannot but recognize Japan's constitutional government, so of course, it cannot but recognize legitimate political parties. Today, the military is unwilling to have a party cabinet and only wants to use a bureaucratic cabinet. Tomorrow, if the political party supported by the military grows up, then of course there will be another story. Recently, fascist groups of Japanese nationalism have been carrying out unification work. When the first organizational conference was held on December 15th, in addition to Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu and Lieutenant General Kobayashi Seizaburo, there were also representatives from the "National Polity Protection League," "Greater Japan Youth Party," and "Greater Japan Production Party," etc., various right-wing organizations in attendance to discuss the formation of a "restoration party." This is clearly the military's attempt to use the power of political parties to attack political parties.</p>
<p>Even if the Hirota cabinet ends in the near future, the Hirota-type cabinet will certainly not completely disappear before the outbreak of a major war. However, like the current Minister of Finance Baba, who is essentially a Japanese banker, this major tax increase was implemented single-handedly by him. The successor to the Hirota cabinet may be this type of most active banker. In short, the successor will definitely be a more active Hirota-type cabinet, and this is probably not wrong.</p>
<p>The "Anti-Comintern Pact" and the "North China Issue" between China and Japan are stalled, and the "Fisheries Treaty" between Japan and Russia failed to be signed due to the establishment of the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact. This is one of the main targets of recent attacks on the Hirota cabinet. However, according to the evening editions of Tokyo newspapers on December 22nd, although the Soviet Union is unwilling to sign the Fisheries Treaty, it has expressed its willingness to establish a temporary agreement. This news seems to make the archers shooting at Hirota dazzled for a while. What is particularly important is that the Xi'an Incident suddenly occurred in China. In this incident, the Hirota cabinet—actually the military—suddenly expressed "wait and see" and extraordinary concern. Under this wait-and-see and concern, Prince De of Inner Mongolia also declared a ceasefire, and the naval landing force that had landed in Qingdao also withdrew. The Hirota cabinet believes that this is a great opportunity for "improvement in Sino-Japanese relations" and is also the main condition for defending the current cabinet from collapsing.</p>
<p>What determines the fate of the Hirota cabinet is, of course, the military. But it might as well be said that it is on the changes in the "neighboring country." (December 22nd)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>New Year's Sentiments for the Twenty-Sixth Year</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. It is also an auspicious time for the beginning of the year. Since ancient times, there have always been wishes at the beginning of the year, hoping for good customs for hundreds of millions of people and celebrating the arrival of good fortune. Getting rid of the old and ushering in the new, carrying on the past and opening up the future, there are meanings to be taken and emotions that cannot be avoided. Since the national crisis, people's hearts have been uneasy. Although they force themselves to be happy, they are mostly discouraged and demoralized. However, there is something I cannot help but say. The meaning of human life activities depends on hope as a link. With hope, there are attempts; with attempts, there is progress. The success of all struggles is driven by hope. Even if the environment is bad, we must strive to improve ourselves. Although the road is full of thorns, we should know to be ambitious and strive to be a hero. Then, at this time of the changing of the year, it is the opportunity for us to sharpen our swords. The praise of pepper flowers can be abandoned, and the evil-warding wine should be poured. Revive our spirit and encourage our enthusiasm, cleanse the past flaws and plan for the future. Auspicious light is abundant, and good fortune is lush. The New Year's Day of the twenty-sixth year is the beginning of the revival of the national fortune and the starting point for the nation to be healthy and strong.</p>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the Shaanxi Incident, the highest leader of the national army was actually hijacked, and unable to exercise his authority. At that time, commentators believed that the initiator dared to cause such a shocking change, which could hardly be expected to be quelled overnight. If the war were to continue, foreign aggression would certainly take advantage of it, and the future of the nation would be unbearable. However, the facts showed that the situation took a sharp turn for the better. Not only were all the trapped generals freed, but the person responsible for the incident was also bound to await punishment. And Chiang Kai-shek, who stayed in Xi'an, was able to return to Nanjing five days before the end of the year. The great disaster was fortunately resolved, and the joy of the people was natural. In terms of diplomacy, the Chengdu and Beihai cases, which had been negotiated and delayed for several times, were also resolved through exchange of documents on the day before New Year's Eve. It was intended to end the ominous events of the twenty-fifth year and create new functions for the twenty-sixth year. This is one of the omens of the revival of the national fortune. When the war in Suiyuan broke out, the soldiers at the front line rose up in indignation, regardless of their position. And the enthusiasm of the rear to transport supplies was even more unstoppable. When Chiang Kai-shek was detained in Xi'an, the national leadership lost its center of gravity, and the state of instability was everywhere. If control were lost, the entire situation would immediately collapse. At that time, the government adopted a firm attitude to seek a calm response, and the people took calm steps to wait for the return of the leader. Facing the crisis without confusion, and gathering their will into one, this is the second omen of the national revival.</p>
<p>Based on what has been said above, it is known that the nation has laid the foundation for unity, which cannot be arbitrarily destroyed by external forces. However, we must not think that things have turned around and become complacent. We should seize the opportunity and strive for progress, maintain the situation of unity, and safeguard the overall national policy. Internally, strengthen our own strength, and externally, promote the spirit of the nation. In this way, national sovereignty can be thoroughly implemented, and East Asian peace can be guaranteed. Who does not want to do good? The whole country should work hard, starting from today.</p>
<h3>Poland Refuses to Participate in the German-Japanese Agreement</h3>
<p>[London] Germany and Japan previously signed the "Anti-Comintern Pact" in Berlin on November 25th. Article 2 of the pact stipulates, "The signatories shall jointly contact countries that feel threatened by the Comintern to allow those countries to participate in this agreement." People here now believe that Germany and Japan recently jointly contacted the Polish government to ask it to participate in the "Anti-Comintern" agreement, but it has been rejected by the Polish government. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador Tells British People that Soviet Russia is Committed to Peace</h3>
<p>Willing to Cooperate with Britain and France Conditionally to Prevent Interference in the Spanish Civil War</p>
<p>[London] Soviet Russian Ambassador Maisky hosted a banquet for guests at the embassy tonight and stood up to give a speech, saying, "I take full responsibility for every word I say today. Today, I announce that the Soviet Russian military is sufficient to defend itself alone and to resist any strong country or any group alone and achieve victory. This is also not revealing state secrets. However, the main purpose of the Soviet Russian Republic is not to win in war, but to eliminate war. This purpose cannot be achieved by Soviet Russia alone. Therefore, Soviet Russia agrees with all plans aimed at promoting goodwill among countries and nations." (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] It was announced here today that the Soviet Russian government is prepared to cooperate with Britain and France to prevent foreigners from participating in the Spanish Civil War, but it has put forward four conditions: (1) All countries that have signed the non-intervention agreement should immediately restrain the influx of foreign volunteers into Spain by effective means. (2) This control method must have nothing to do with the attitude of the Spanish left-wing generals. (3) The signatory countries must organize formal or informal delegations to monitor whether volunteers are flowing into Spain. If there is an influx, it must be announced immediately. (4) The above conditions must take effect immediately in order to prevent the increase of foreign troops. The second condition is quite inconsistent with the policy of the Non-Intervention Agreement Committee, because the committee treats both the left and right sides equally, and the third condition can enable Soviet Russian consuls in Spain to report the arrival of German troops in Spanish territory. (National Telegram on the 30th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov replied to the British and French dispatches today, stating that Soviet Russia is willing to unconditionally agree to prohibit volunteer teams from going to Spain, and said that Soviet Russia has learned that the Spanish Nationalist Army has received assistance from the German and Italian people. These people are traveling to Spain in teams on specially prepared ships. Judging from their condition, military equipment, and specially transferred ships, it cannot be regarded as a voluntary movement. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Germany Plans to Stop Sending Volunteers to Aid Spanish Rebels</h3>
<p>Italy Will Submit a Reply to Britain and France Immediately, Expressing Agreement in Principle</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to foreign sources today, the departure of volunteers from various parts of Germany to Spain has now been postponed, pending the decision of Führer Hitler on the future policy towards the Spanish Civil War. Reliable sources revealed that there are currently 10,000 German volunteers in Spain. There are fewer Italians and between 40,000 and 50,000 French. Spokespersons for the Propaganda Department and the Foreign Ministry today dismissed Mussolini's request for Hitler to withdraw from Spain as ridiculous, saying that Germany does not need foreign advice. German army officers are greatly surprised by the effectiveness of Russian pilots and tanks in the Spanish government army. These officers have never believed in the power of Soviet Russian military equipment. Now they are gradually believing that Soviet Russia not only has the largest air force in Europe, but also the most elite air force in Europe. (National Telegram on the 30th)</p>
<p>[Rome] It is heard that Italy's reply to the British and French proposal on non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War will express agreement in principle, but will require a firm guarantee that countries that sympathize with the Madrid government, especially France and Russia, must maintain the non-intervention agreement. The reply will be sent out in a day or two. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th).</p>
<p>[Rome] The governments of Britain and France recently sent notes to the governments of Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia, advising them not to send any more volunteers to Spain to join the war. It is now learned that the Italian government's reply to the note will be sent out in a day or two. Political figures are convinced that, even if the wording of Italy's reply is not exactly the same as the reply that Germany should submit, its general meaning is consistent. In other words, the replies from Italy and Germany should accept in principle the expansion of the non-intervention measures in the Spanish Civil War to include the ban on volunteers joining the war. However, when this measure is implemented, actual facts should be taken into account. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the strict supervision when implementing non-intervention measures in the Spanish Civil War, the Coordination Committee sent a note to the governments of the countries concerned last week, asking them to express their opinions. It is now learned that the Italian government has submitted a reply expressing its support for the strict supervision proposal. Italy is now continuing to argue that all issues of indirect interference in the Spanish Civil War should be discussed as a whole. However, indirect interference takes many different forms and should be studied item by item. For practical convenience, the issue of banning volunteers from joining the war may be discussed first. In this regard, Italy has accepted in principle the ban on volunteers joining the war, but on the condition that all countries accept this proposal and strictly abide by it, that is, any private individuals going to Spain should also be banned. The Italian government has also requested that all cash stored abroad by both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War be "neutralized" and that public fundraising be prohibited for use by either party in the civil war. The two sub-committees of the Coordination Committee, which are responsible for handling the issues of "Volunteers Joining the War" and "Financial Assistance," are now scheduled to meet at the Foreign Ministry tomorrow to review the Italian government's reply. It is heard that the British and French governments believe that the prohibition of any private individuals from going to Spain is contrary to the current laws of their respective countries and is difficult to implement. As for the "neutralization" of stored gold, it is also difficult to implement, because the cash stored in London and Paris by both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War is not in the name of the government, but only in the name of private individuals. In London, it is entrusted to banks for safekeeping in the name of private individuals, and the banks have a professional obligation to keep the names of the trustees confidential. In Paris, the two parties in Spain often rent safe deposit boxes from banks under assumed names to store cash. These safe deposit boxes can only be opened by order of the judicial authorities after a lawsuit is filed. Therefore, it is actually difficult to prohibit the withdrawal of this type of stored gold, and there are many complications. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>German Ship Released, German Government Satisfied</h3>
<p>Spanish Rebels Send Representatives to Germany and Italy</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German government seems quite satisfied with the Spanish government's prompt release of the German ship Palos. Today, the official news agency issued a communiqué praising the captain of the German cruiser Königsberg for handling the case seriously and cautiously. However, it expressed regret that one of the Spanish passengers on the ship was arrested by the Spanish authorities and that part of the cargo on the ship was also confiscated by the Spanish authorities, because the cargo carried by the ship did not contain war materials. The communiqué demanded a complete clarification of these two matters. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Spanish Embassy in France has issued a statement saying that after the German merchant ship "Palos" was released by the authorities of the Basque Autonomous Region, the captain of the German cruiser "Königsberg" immediately sent a radio message to Aguirre, the head of the autonomous region, in the name of the German government, which was somewhat like a formal complaint, stating, "The 'Palos' was detained by warships of the Spanish government army 23 miles off the coast of Spain, that is, on the high seas, which is a violation of international law. The authorities of the Basque Autonomous Region must immediately return the seized goods and release the Spanish person on board, otherwise the autonomous region government will be responsible for all the consequences." Aguirre immediately replied, "The 'Palos' was detained within Spanish territorial waters, and its cargo contained raw materials for the manufacture of bombs and gunpowder, as well as military radio transceivers, which are contraband military supplies and can be confiscated according to international law." The captain of the "Königsberg" replied that he had received the reply, and nothing else. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Avila: After Germany and Italy recognized the Spanish Nationalist Army government, they respectively appointed representatives to the Spanish Nationalist Army government in Burgos. They have also recently appointed Garcia as the representative to Italy and Terstrada as the representative to Germany, and sent consuls to Hamburg, Frankfurt, and Munich in Germany, and Trieste and Genoa in Italy.

<h3>British Embassy in Madrid Relocates</h3>
<p>Consulate Remains</p>
<p>Madrid: Although the British Embassy in Madrid will move to Valencia with the Spanish government, it has now been decided that the British Consulate in Madrid will remain. The British expatriates who do not advocate leaving the area feel somewhat relieved after hearing this. The British expatriates were disappointed yesterday after receiving the news that the British government had decided to move the embassy to Valencia. The British Chamber of Commerce in Madrid has telegraphed British Foreign Secretary Eden, stating the reasons against the relocation of the British Embassy. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>Madrid: British Chargé d'Affaires Forbes has been ordered to move to Valencia. The last group of British expatriates here is also scheduled to go to Alicante on Friday, and then go to Marseille, France, and Gibraltar. The personnel of the British Embassy will also move to Valencia later. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>[London] The Foreign Office yesterday ordered the Chargé d'Affaires in Spain, Forbes, to move from Madrid to Valencia in order to maintain direct contact with the Spanish Republican government. It is generally interpreted that this move is intended to allow the last group of British expatriates in Madrid to withdraw completely, so Forbes was first ordered to leave the capital. As for whether a British Vice Consul will be stationed in Madrid, it is a temporary measure to protect British commercial interests and, if necessary, assist in the withdrawal of expatriates.

<p>[London] Geeligan, a representative of the Scottish branch of the British Communist Party, formed a team of Scottish volunteers on the 18th of this month, totaling 150 people, and sent them to Spain to assist the government army in fighting. Wanligan is now continuing to recruit Scots to form teams in order to send them to Spain. According to Geeligan's estimates, by the end of January next year, there will be as many as 500 Scots assisting the government army in fighting. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<h3>1936 Retrospective on Japanese Politics and Economics</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] It is fortunate that the eventful year of 1936 was able to pass without the expected great disaster. Although Japan encountered many unprecedented and serious incidents in various aspects of both domestic and foreign affairs during this year, it entered 1937 peacefully, similar to other countries in the world. This fact can be considered a piece of good fortune for the Far East. The February 26th Incident was Japan's most serious event this year, which is widely known. The Hirota Cabinet was formed in the broad and profound aftermath of the incident, with "military purification" and "renewal of general administration" as its greatest tasks. Thanks to the efforts of Army Minister Terauchi over the past ten months, "military purification" has achieved considerable success, but the price for this has been an unprecedented military expansion plan, which has been passed by the Cabinet and submitted to the parliament. The discussion on "renewal of general administration" is still ongoing and has not yet yielded results. Although half of the seven political plans announced by the Cabinet in August of this year have been incorporated into the next fiscal year's budget draft, the other half is still under detailed review, which has caused various criticisms. The most serious and complex task of "renewal of general administration" is the reform of the administrative structure, for which Hirota is currently hesitating, as it involves the basic organization of Japanese politics. Japan's decision to increase military preparations, adopt the so-called "quasi-wartime system", implement large-scale tax increase plans, and the Japan-Germany Agreement are sufficient to show Japan's "quasi-wartime system" in economic and diplomatic terms. If the administrative structure reform is realized, the political aspect will also become a "quasi-wartime system." Therefore, this point is important. Although the administrative structure will inevitably undergo some reforms in the future, whether the degree of reform can satisfy those who advocate reform is still a question. This is one of the factors determining the fate of the Hirota Cabinet.</p>
<p>Another thorny issue in Japanese domestic affairs is the reform of the parliamentary system. Some parties want to weaken parliamentary power, strengthen and concentrate the power of the cabinet, and make the administrative structure a prerequisite for the "quasi-wartime system." Because parliamentary power is granted by the constitution, any restrictions will inevitably involve constitutional issues. Political parties regard the parliament as their last lifeline, so if parliamentary power is restricted, political parties will collapse. Therefore, the current parliament will raise severe questions about the government's belief in parliament. Whether the Hirota Cabinet can clearly and affirmatively express its belief will be another factor determining the fate of the Cabinet.</p>
<p>The most important issue in the current parliament is the tax increase plan. The impact of this plan on people's lives is unprecedented. Therefore, the people hope that the parliament will abolish it. However, the parliament is in a dilemma between the government and the people. If it passes the plan, it will violate the people's protests and further damage the authority of political parties. If it opposes the plan, there is a risk of promoting its own dissolution. Even if the government has no intention of dissolving the parliament, it will at least increase the friction between political parties and certain parties, which is a serious crisis for party politics. This is another factor determining the fate of the Hirota Cabinet.</p>
<p>Diplomatic failures, although still the target of strong attacks, have shown signs of easing due to the conclusion of the Japan-Australia trade agreement and the extension of the Japan-Soviet fisheries treaty. On the first day of the current parliament, far-right political parties such as the National Alliance urgently proposed questioning the government's diplomacy. Although the Seiyukai and Minseito parties dissuaded them, the tension in the parliamentary atmosphere has been fully revealed. The Japan-Germany Agreement will undoubtedly be one of the focal points of parliamentary questioning. The failure of the new Japan-Soviet fisheries treaty to obtain the signature of the Soviet Union will also become an unavoidable serious diplomatic responsibility. The failure of the Sino-Japanese negotiations has further strengthened the opinions of various parties opposing the government's diplomatic policy. In recent days, the general view has been that political parties should be cautious about diplomatic issues, but the parliament clearly does not want to let it pass easily. If the current cabinet makes a wrong step in dealing with the parliament, there will be serious developments. This is another deciding point for the fate of the Hirota Cabinet.</p>
<p>The above four points not only sufficiently represent the characteristics of Japan's domestic and foreign affairs this year, but also serve as a prospect for future trends. Whether the Hirota Cabinet continues to exist is far less important than future trends. Finally, we should pay attention to Japan's policy toward China. After the Xi'an Incident, the Japanese people's perception of China has undergone a new change. At the beginning of the incident, a few Japanese people who were unaware of China's recent situation had incorrect observations. However, the intellectual class generally believed that China would not fall back into chaos simply because of the Xi'an Incident. When the incident was resolved, all parties in Japan were startled to realize that China's political, financial, monetary, and organizational structures were more stable than expected. Chiang Kai-shek's passing through a vote of confidence from the Chinese people in the incident was even more surprising to the Japanese. Therefore, the idea of "not dealing with China with preconceptions" has become more and more powerful. Due to the strengthening of China's unified forces, Japan's policy toward China next year may have to focus on economic cooperation. The reporter firmly believes that due to China's increasingly solid unity and unyielding diplomatic responses, Sino-Japanese relations will gradually improve next year.</p>
<p>The important developments in Japan's economy over the past year can be described as follows: (1) the quasi-wartime nature has become more active; (2) the contradictions in various production sectors have become increasingly acute; (3) massive excess of imports; (4) the determination of huge budgets and tax increase plans; (5) the people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult. Since Army Minister Terauchi took office and advocated a widespread awareness of national defense and increased military preparations in Manchuria, the quasi-wartime nature of the Japanese economy has advanced further this year. In addition to the astonishing expansion of state-owned heavy industries this year, private military industries subsidized by the government have also made considerable progress. Steel production this year has increased threefold compared to 1932. The electricity industry, one of the centers of Japanese military production, has seen its capital increase a hundredfold compared to 1932. This point is particularly noteworthy. The government has almost controlled all aspects of Japanese economic life based on mobilization, and it is becoming increasingly severe. First, it promulgated laws to control various important industries and the automobile industry, and then promulgated the Fertilizer Control Law, revised the Exchange Control Law, established the Currency Control Law, strengthened import and export controls, placed various insurance companies under government management, merged local banks, etc. The centralization of tax revenue, the nationalization of the electricity industry, the standardization of industrial production that can be used for military preparations, and the connection between local industries and military industries are all important steps toward a wartime economy. However, due to the abnormal development of military industries, the ordinary economy has been greatly unbalanced. For example, the average index of metallurgical production this year is as high as 266 (1928 is 100), while silk fabrics are only 122, and food and beverages are even lower at 99. Furthermore, the severe shortage of raw materials in Japan has been fully exposed due to the insane development of military industries. Hundreds of small and medium-sized metallurgical factories in Kawaguchi and Kobe have recently been closed due to the lack of pig iron, and countless workers have lost their jobs. It is beyond doubt that the exhaustion of domestic production capacity under the needs of military preparations this year will be exacerbated by the huge military budget next year. Japan's international trade in 1936 showed a decline in both quantity and quality. There was an excess of imports of 133 million yen, an increase of 85% compared to 1935. One-fourth of the imported goods were military materials, while the main export goods, cotton cloth and wheat flour, decreased by 3.3% and 48%, respectively. Among the 127 countries that have trade relations with Japan, the number of countries boycotting Japanese goods has increased to 76. Trade talks between Japan and the United Kingdom, Japan and India, Japan and the Netherlands, Japan and Egypt, and Japan and Canada have either failed to continue or have yielded no results. The factors controlling Japanese trade this year will only intensify next year. Japan paid out 250 million yen in gold this year, breaking the record of 1931. What is even more surprising is that the new budget reaches 3.04 billion yen, exceeding this year's by more than a quarter and more than double that of 1931. Excluding special funds given to local governments, the army alone accounts for 4.99%. If subsidies for aircraft and chemical industries are included, Japan's national defense budget for 1937 totals 178 million yen, which is larger than any non-wartime country and comparable only to Germany before the Great War. At the same time, the funds for relieving rural small and medium-sized industries are only 24 million yen, less than 1% of the total expenditure. The Hirota Cabinet, which claims to stabilize people's lives, is contradicting its previous statements. Minister of Finance Baba has promised a budget of 3.04 billion yen, and he has to resort to increasing taxes to a huge 1.424 billion yen, which is 500 million yen or 55% more than this year. On the one hand, 961 million yen of deficit bonds will be issued. Most of the tax increase plan items and several new taxes will greatly increase the burden on the people. The result will reduce the elasticity of tax revenue. At the same time, Japan's loss-making power will be reduced to 700 million yen (1.91 billion yen in 1910 and 800 million yen in 1935). Whether the bond issuance plan can be successful is a big question. Japan's public debt has exceeded 10 billion yen this year. In the next six years, it will increase by 1 billion yen each year, reaching 16 billion yen by 1941. Although it is according to the plan of Finance Minister Baba, the issuance of public bonds will be reduced by 100 million yen each year after 1941 until 1949, when no more debts can be borrowed. At that time, the Japanese government's debt will reach 20 billion yen, which makes the Japanese people very anxious. Although the government authorities refuse to admit that Japan has fallen into vicious inflation, this has become obvious this year. A look at the amount of banknotes issued reveals that it has increased sharply from 1.2 billion yen at the beginning of this year to a huge 2 billion yen on December 29. If we consider the construction of military preparations and rising prices, vicious inflation will inevitably be more severe next year. Under this situation, those who feel seriously threatened are undoubtedly millions of Japanese laborers. The increase in the cost of living is one of the direct threats to them. According to official statistics, it has reached 203.5 at the end of this year. The cost of living in 1900 was 100. On the other hand, currency wages have depreciated to 81 (non-real wages). According to official statistics, there were 1,457 labor disputes in the first nine months of this year, 237 more than in the same period last year. This is not accidental. It is also impossible to ignore the increased unrest in rural areas. According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, there were a total of 6,824 tenant disputes in the one year ending at the end of July 1936, an increase of about 1,000 cases compared to the same period last year. In short, Japan has entered 1937 with a very highly developed "quasi-wartime system." Because there are opposition and unease, how long this system can be allowed to continue is a question that needs to be carefully explored. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3>Baldwin's New Year's Oration</h3>
<p>Wishing this year to be a year of peace</p>
<p>[London] Prime Minister Baldwin is scheduled to deliver an oration at the Conservative Party's "Sunflower Union" on New Year's Day, in order to review the government's administration over the past year. The contents are roughly as follows: "The government has been very concerned about various diplomatic issues in the past year. The European situation is precarious. As a result, most people are deeply convinced that if Britain wants to avoid attacks from other countries and be a pillar of peace, the government's current foreign policy is the only possible policy. I am deeply convinced of this. As for the process of expanding military preparations, this is to deal with the world situation. European countries are now expanding their military preparations, so in Britain, no matter who is in power, military preparations cannot be ignored. However, for various military actions, Britain will not participate in any military actions that are inconsistent with the League of Nations Covenant. All countries do not need to worry that Britain has aggressive intentions. The British government has done its best to promote the reduction of military preparations in various countries through the conclusion of international agreements. Only after our efforts have clearly failed did the government decide to strengthen the defensive national defense equipment." Although there are many issues that can disrupt and threaten world peace at this time, I firmly believe that 1937 will be a "year of peace," and Britain's national power will become more prosperous.

<h3>The US economy is thriving</h3>
<p>Trade development reduces unemployment</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of Commerce Roper issued a year-end message, celebrating the gradual recovery of various businesses in 1936, but warned the public not to underestimate the lingering depression. Roper said that the number of unemployed people in 1936 has decreased significantly, but the unemployment problem is still important today. He hopes that the joint efforts of the business community and the government, aided by the expansion of business, can continue to make significant progress in solving the unemployment problem in 1937. Roper also mentioned the increase in industrial production, farm income, commerce, and foreign trade, saying that today's activities are the most prosperous since 1930 and still show a thriving trend.

<h3>The Pope of Rome is not out of danger</h3>
<p>Attended Mass last night at midnight</p>
<p>Vatican City Today, the blood clots in the Pope's left leg have gradually disappeared tonight, so his condition has improved significantly. He took a short nap this afternoon, but there is still a possibility of blood clots and a recurrence of the risk of detachment, so it cannot be said that he is out of danger. In addition, the Pope's heart is quite weak, which is also a dangerous point. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>Vatican City This afternoon, the Pope's condition has improved slightly, and the pain is also slightly relieved. The Pope has decided to personally welcome the New Year. He will be awakened before midnight and go to the temporary chapel next to his bedroom to attend midnight Mass. At that time, the Pope will lie in a comfortable easy chair to avoid fatigue. The Pope's physician has allowed him to participate in this ceremony, which shows that his condition has indeed improved. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Vatican City There are many people in Rome suffering from influenza, which makes the Pope's physicians very worried. Because the Pope's condition is critical, it is difficult to resist even a slight cold. Therefore, the Vatican authorities only allowed a few visitors to enter today to prevent the Pope from catching a cold. (National Electricity dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>US fresh fruit exports to France decrease</h3>
<p>There are two reasons for this</p>
<p>[Washington] The current trade agreement between France and the United States has mutually stipulated import quotas for goods between the two countries. US fresh fruit exporters have protested to the State Department because the amount of fresh fruit sold to France recently has not reached the quota stipulated in the trade agreement. The State Department has recently sent someone to investigate whether the decrease in fresh fruit exports to France is only due to the devaluation of the franc. American business people believe that there are two reasons for this: one is due to the devaluation of the franc, and the other is due to the poor harvest of fresh fruit in the United States this year, which has led to higher prices and a decrease in exports to France.

<h3>US auto industry suffers from overproduction</h3>
<p>Factory shutdowns increase unemployment</p>
<p>Detroit Today, General Motors issued a temporary announcement, ordering its subsidiaries to stop supplying parts to various manufacturing departments to avoid exceeding the amount needed for production. From this, we can understand a glimpse of the labor unrest in the US auto industry. The second factory of Fisher Body Company started a strike yesterday, causing 1,200 workers to lose their jobs. The shutdown of the assembly and delivery departments of Chevrolet Company has also caused more than a thousand workers to lose their jobs. According to the above two companies, both are subsidiaries of General Motors. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt convenes a meeting to discuss strengthening the Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>New Congress opens at the beginning of this month to discuss many important bills</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt convened Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Representative MacReynolds, Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, and Acting Secretary of State Moore today to discuss strengthening the current Neutrality Act as soon as possible. The State Department's recent permission for Wheeler Company to transport aircraft and aircraft engines to Spain was the motivation for convening this meeting. (National Electricity dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>[New York] The important events to be discussed by the current Congress have all been included in the agenda. Among them, the following items will be discussed in advance:</p>
<p>[1) Expansion and strengthening of the Neutrality Act. Because of the looming war clouds in Europe and the moral ban on transporting weapons to Spain, there is a risk of collapse, so the general public is paying close attention to this.</p>
<p>[2) Saving expenses, especially focusing on balancing the budget.</p>
<p>[3) The agency that replaces the National Recovery Administration. President Roosevelt is likely to pressure Congress to pass laws stipulating minimum wages, maximum working hours, and the abolition of child labor.</p>
<p>[4) Revising the monetary powers granted to the President, especially paying attention to the fund for stabilizing exchange rates.</p>
<p>[5) Expansion of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.</p>
<p>[6) Farm rent and grain insurance.</p>
<p>[7) Minimum cost of housing.</p>
<p>[8) Re-submitting the St. Lawrence River Treaty to the Senate for approval.</p>
<p>[9) Revising the social security system and reforming the tax system. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Congress is about to open, and there are many domestic issues to be resolved. However, President Roosevelt still took the time today to discuss neutrality issues with Acting Secretary of State Moore, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative McReynold, Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, to avoid the sparks from spreading and causing the European situation to become a prairie fire. The State Department sent a telegram to the US Embassy in Paris today, explaining the government's actions, saying that the government cannot prohibit the transportation of aircraft to Spain according to law. It is a pity that US businessmen are unwilling to comply with the government's strict neutrality policy. Secretary of the Army Woodring claimed today that at the beginning of January this year, the Department of the Army sold 300 outdated aircraft engines to Vimala Company. It is not known whether the engines that the company intends to transport to Spain are those engines. At the same time, the Washington Post believes that Vimala Company may have a connection with Antog, the Soviet Russian commercial agency in the United States. Therefore, officials immediately reviewed the files of the House of Representatives' investigation of the Communist Party and found that Gas, the former deputy director of Antog, testified in court that Vimala Company purchased 400 aircraft engines from Antog in 1927 and transported them to Soviet Russia. This situation is a shortcoming of the Neutrality Act. However, Congress can pass any remedial measures as soon as possible, and the State Department can revoke the issued license. (National Electricity dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The US Congress is scheduled to reconvene on January 5. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will submit a draft law on the following day, requesting that a clause be added to the current Neutrality Act so that the ban on weapons can also be applied to other countries' civil wars. (The intention of this clause is to prevent 18 aircraft and 411 engines from being transported to Spain. (People in the know recently announced that when the Chaco War broke out in 1934, Congress passed a bill on May 28 of that year and delegated the power of expediency to President Roosevelt to implement a ban on weapons to Bolivia and Paraguay, the two parties involved. The content of the draft law to be submitted this time will be similar to the previous case. President Roosevelt has decided to request Congress to take emergency procedures, so this new bill must be quickly submitted for discussion, and most members of Congress will support it. Even the opposition Republican leader Vandenberg also supports the prohibition of transporting aircraft to Spain, but opposes the delegation of the power of expediency to the President. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The US State Department issued an export permit yesterday, approving the transportation of 18 aircraft and 411 engines to Spain, to be delivered to the Spanish Republican government. The State Department recently instructed the ambassadors to France, Britain, Germany, Russia, and Italy to explain to the governments of their respective countries that the US current Neutrality Act only applies the clause on banning weapons to other countries' external wars and does not apply to other countries' civil wars. Therefore, there is no way to prohibit the export of the above aircraft. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<h3>Yugoslavia and Bulgaria make progress in treaty negotiations</h3>
<p>Political and economic cooperation is intended to increase influence in the Balkans</p>
<p>Belgrade Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have made progress in negotiating a friendship treaty to protect the current borders of the two countries and guarantee their political and economic cooperation. It is widely believed that the purpose of these negotiations is to make Bulgaria join the Balkan Pact. It is said that Bulgaria has clearly abandoned its revisionist demands, which may be due to the pressure of Italy. Italy's influence in the Balkans will therefore increase.

<h3>Political Views of Archduke Otto</h3>
<p>Following Imperial Traditional Policies to Prevent Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>[Vienna] Across Austria, there are over one thousand three hundred towns that have bestowed the honorary citizenship upon Archduke Otto, the heir to the former Habsburg imperial family. Taking the opportunity of the New Year, Archduke Otto specifically issued a proclamation to the people of these towns, explaining his political views, stating that should he one day return to the country and assume power, he would maintain peace both internally and externally. He would provide assistance to farmers, relief to the unemployed, and safeguard industry, commerce, and handicrafts. He also commended the current government's restoration of compulsory military service and establishment of a new army. In essence, his policy is to follow the traditional policies of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and continue to advance, as only this can prevent foreign powers from conquering Austria.

<h3>Guangdong Business Community Requests Loans for Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>Provincial Bank Plans to Issue Acceptance Bills; Merchants Request Cash Loans as Before</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: With the Lunar New Year approaching, the Guangdong business community, adhering to tradition, settles accounts at the end of the year, mostly in the last month of the lunar year. In the past year, due to the impact of social and economic decline, there has been no large-scale trade in the market. Although the number of bankruptcy cases at the end of the year has slightly decreased, the financial market has experienced significant fluctuations due to several political upheavals. The most affected are silver firms because the value of currencies and bonds fluctuates constantly, and silver firms with hundreds of thousands of capital can go bankrupt in an instant. Recently, due to the Xi'an Incident, more than a dozen silver firms have gone bankrupt due to losses in currency trading. The bankruptcy of these silver firms has affected the financial turnover of various shops and stores. Therefore, at the end of this lunar year, the market is showing a sudden shortage of funds. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has petitioned the Finance Department, requesting the Provincial Bank to follow the old practice of previous years and provide loans for the New Year to provide relief. The Provincial Bank has prepared five million yuan for New Year loans, but the loan method is not to release cash directly but to use acceptance bills. Merchants who need funds to get through the New Year can pledge their stored goods to the Provincial Bank as collateral and receive a bill of exchange, stating the amount of the loan they wish to borrow. After receiving the application, the bank will send staff to the store requesting the loan to verify the situation. If it is confirmed, they will sign the original bill of exchange, acknowledging the responsibility to repay the loan when it is due. This bill of exchange will have the same effect as currency and can circulate in the market. If necessary, it can also be discounted at the bank to request immediate payment of cash to facilitate capital turnover. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened discussions with various merchants regarding this acceptance bill method. It was decided to appoint executive committee members of the chamber, together with representatives from the cotton yarn industry, sugar and flour industry, peanut industry, sesame industry, grain industry, coal industry, bean industry, export trading houses, silk industry, raw medicinal materials industry, prepared medicinal materials industry, rice and sugar industry, Chinese and foreign general merchandise industry, and local and foreign head offices, to negotiate everything with the Provincial Bank. As a result, the cotton yarn industry, native cloth industry, sugar and flour industry, and leather industry, etc., due to excessive inventory, urgently need cash turnover, so they all agreed to the acceptance bills. However, some merchants who need cash but do not have goods to pledge, such as silver firms and gold businesses, etc., inevitably feel left out. Therefore, they plan to request the Provincial Bank to organize commercial credit acceptance bills to universally benefit merchants. There are also those who believe that the procedures for acceptance bills are too cumbersome, and merchants do not fully benefit from them, requesting that the Provincial Bank still follow the old practice of previous years, designating loan amounts so that merchants can borrow money by mortgaging real estate. Therefore, New Year loans have not yet been implemented. (29th)</p>
<h3>Shanxi Provincial Government Orders County Magistrates to Seriously Handle the Improvement of the Village System (Continued)</h3>
<p>Promulgating Important Notes on the Procedures for Implementing Village Improvement Expenses; Selecting and Sending Village Chiefs for Training Starting March 1st Next Year</p>
<p>D. When provisionally organizing villages, special attention should be paid to the distance and whether they are united. If the old village organization was formed due to the customs of the same covenant or the same Li-Jia, etc., resulting in a long or intermingled village organization, it must be thoroughly re-divided during this reorganization, and the intermingled villages or villages that are far from the main village should be combined with neighboring villages. If the number of households in the originally organized village is insufficient, it should also be jointly combined with nearby villages to facilitate handling matters. E. When provisionally organizing villages, if there are intermingled villages crossing the boundaries of two districts, for the convenience of organization and jurisdiction, they may be re-divided and transferred to another jurisdiction as appropriate, without being restricted by the old boundaries of each district, so as not to hinder factual convenience. (4) The county magistrate and the district chiefs should jointly hire impartial local gentry, five from each district. After consultation, the county magistrate will send appointment letters and immediately notify the gentry to arrive at the county on January 6th to review whether the provisional village organization planned by the county district conforms to local conditions, provide as much advice as possible, and make a careful decision.

The village chief and deputy should be responsible for discussing and deciding on the village union and should not delay or miss the deadline; C. Solicit the opinions of each village deputy on the provisional organization and raise them for discussion as much as possible. If there are legitimate reasons to fear that difficulties will arise in the implementation of the provisional organization, the district chief must be responsible for resolving them on the spot. If they cannot be resolved, they should be reported to the county magistrate after the meeting, and the county magistrate will convene the village chiefs and deputies involved to resolve them.

<p>Caught Using Counterfeit Money</p>
<p>Fengjing Peak Grand Ceremony: At around 8 a.m. on the 28th, Shen Boying's wife from Fangjia Xia Township went to redeem clothes, presenting a counterfeit 10-yuan Central Bank note to be changed. The pawnshop clerk recognized the counterfeit money and asked her to exchange it. Unexpectedly, the five notes she carried were all the same, indicating that she was using counterfeit money. The woman was immediately taken to the Public Security Bureau. According to her confession, the rice money was given to her by Fang Xiuyun from the same village. Director Xia immediately sent detectives to arrest Fang in a teahouse, where they found thirteen 1-yuan Central Bank counterfeit notes. At the same time, villager Fang Yuyun also handed over four yuan worth of banknotes given to him by Fang Xiuyun for rice money, which were also the same counterfeit notes. Fang Xiuyun was taken back together with the counterfeit money and a document was submitted to the County Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>

<p>Qingtian Reef Channel Changes</p>
<p>The Qingtian Reef channel on the Tongzhou River used to be extremely dangerous, making navigation difficult for river vessels. It has now been surveyed by the Customs and a new navigation route has been discovered. The original channel has been closed due to siltation, and the river's lightships have also been moved.</p>
<h3>One Year of Scientific Progress</h3>
<p>— Translated by Eric N. Davis</p>
<p>In news magazines, one often sees vivid articles describing important public events. If someone were to similarly narrate the scientific achievements of any given year, he would find many difficulties.</p>
<p>Today’s record will be buried by another miracle tomorrow, and forgotten by almost everyone in a week. Several weeks ago, an aviator achieved an unprecedented feat: he flew to nearly ten miles above the ground; but who could have predicted that, before this event was even announced, another, more fortunate Icarus would fly even closer to the sun and return safely?</p>
<p>In any case, the astronomical realm, now beyond the reach of the naked eye, will soon be captured by camera lenses, because the two-hundred-inch telescope on Mount Palomar has been successfully cast, and after a complex and time-consuming polishing process, it can be used. This giant lens is roughly "sawed" instead of silver-coated ("Auminized") because someone discovered that aluminum has many, many advantages over silver! In the near future, "silver-coated mirrors" will probably disappear from major observatories around the world.</p>
<p>New Discoveries in the Milky Way</p>
<p>Nineteen thirty-six was a year worth remembering for astronomers, because in that year, Dr. Shapley, director of the Harvard Observatory, announced the discovery of the Milky Way’s "window," through which humans for the first time were able to peer into the depths of the universe from amidst the chaotic mists, and, according to reports, as a result of this invention, as many as one hundred and forty-seven different novae have been discovered.</p>
<p>As for the observation of nearby objects, science has invented the "electron image tube"—which uses a fluorescent screen as an artificial retina—giving mankind "eyes" that see almost four times as far as normal. On this retina, the "electron image tube" receives and transmits clear images, which are transmitted by infrared rays (also known as "black light")—invisible to the human eye. In addition to astronomy, medicine, biology, and military affairs are all looking forward to gaining great benefits from this newly invented device.</p>
<p>In the military field, the latest naval shells can penetrate twelve-inch armor plating and be fired without being damaged. The aircraft cannon invented by the Swiss (which normally can only fire machine gun bullets) can fire eight hundred bombs per minute.</p>
<p>Glass Houses</p>
<p>Besides those destructive things, there are other questions about the sky. Although the man who broke the record for the highest stratosphere in a balloon has not yet been found, small balloons carrying automatic recorders are often launched into the high sky above the clouds to study the mysterious problem of cosmic rays that are constantly bombarding the earth.</p>
<p>Although the question of the origin of cosmic rays is still under debate, it is unanimously acknowledged that cosmic rays can pass through any obstacle. Therefore, there is no reason to worry that glass bricks used for construction will crack due to cosmic rays. Glass bricks are translucent, not opaque; they can let almost eighty percent of all light into the interior of houses built with this kind of brick.</p>
<p>However, sunlight alone cannot completely guarantee health, at least not for individuals subject to heredity and environment. Human beings are still bound to suffer from many diseases. However, thanks to the cooperation of chemists and surgeons, research on the sources and effective treatments of diseases has been progressing daily.</p>
<p>Five New Elements</p>
<p>Several diseases, considered incurable a few years ago, can now be treated or cured. Generally speaking, the methods are obtained through systematic long-term research, but sometimes they are also due to unexpected accidental discoveries.</p>
<p>For example, the use of insulin to treat diabetes is, of course, a recent invention, but according to recent findings, if zinc is added to the injection, the life of insulin's effect can be extended considerably. Also, after two years of experimentation, patients with arthritis can be cured by a newly discovered chemical compound, and the popular belief that arthritis is caused by infection has also been overturned.</p>
<p>For many years, the scientific community has unanimously assumed that there are at most ninety-two truly existing elements—gold, nitrogen, lead, oxygen, and others. However, according to a report from the famous Hugh Keforham Institute, the bombardment of atoms of uranium—the heaviest and most complex element—has resulted in the production of at least five new, heavier, and more complex elements.</p>
<p>Man-Made Materials</p>
<p>Like radium and uranium, these new elements are all radioactive, so they cannot exist stably, which is probably the reason why these new elements cannot be found in the universe. Because the amount produced is so small, some people may doubt whether the discovery of these new elements is a mistake, but careful and accurate chemical tests have fully proven their existence.</p>
<p>However, in addition to pursuing knowledge for the sake of knowledge, chemists have other motivations.</p>
<p>The current world economic situation is enough to entice chemists to compete with nature. Artificial rubber, although different in form from natural products, is a valuable raw material. In the Soviet Union, the production of artificial rubber made from alcohol reached 25,000 tons last year and is expected to increase to 40,000 tons in one or two years. Germany is another country known for its technological progress in this area; a factory in the United States can manufacture as much as one million pounds of rubber substitutes per year.</p>
<p>These artificial materials are not all made to replace natural products. For example, a railway company makes a steel plate with a pattern and form similar to wood. Also, a certain metal alloy, which looks like gold and is stronger than steel, is actually composed mostly of copper and a small amount of beryllium: if the cost could be reduced, the use of this alloy could be greatly expanded.</p>
<p>What is the Most Outstanding?</p>
<p>The use of artificial resins is becoming increasingly widespread, and the recently discovered use related to aircraft construction will obviously have a profound impact on aircraft design. In fact, some people have made predictions that the light and bright low-wing monoplanes that are currently considered very fashionable will become as old-fashioned in ten years as the biplanes and triplanes of 1918 are today.</p>
<p>So, among the various scientific achievements of 1936, which can be called the most outstanding?</p>
<p>Answering this question is not an easy task, because when this question is asked to anyone, each person will have their own biases. However, the progress of television, which is known to the public, although not yet completely successful and the equipment used is expensive, is probably an important achievement.</p>
<p>Radio communication has created a miracle, turning different ethnic groups separated by high mountains and vast seas into neighbors! Even if not into friends. — We can hope that practical vision is the last link in that great chain, which will link different individuals and countries into mutually friendly groups; by that time, science will abandon destructive work and calmly devote itself to solving the various problems that still face mankind.</p>

<h3>The 26th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China: All Circles in the City Held a Grand Celebration at the Chamber of Commerce This Morning</h3>
<p>The whole city flies flags and has three days off. The municipal government also held a group New Year greeting ceremony. The radio station broadcasted Mayor Wu's speech.</p>
<p>Today is the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. At 10:00 a.m., in addition to the celebration meeting held by all circles at the Chamber of Commerce, the municipal government also held a group New Year greeting ceremony. In addition, seafarer groups, the Kuomintang party branches on both roads, various hometown associations, and various groups also had lunch and group New Year greeting ceremonies. However, the lantern parade was stopped according to the order. The letter from the municipal government to its subordinate agencies is recorded as follows: (1) Dear Sir/Madam, I am instructed by the Mayor that the celebration ceremony for the 26th New Year's Day and the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, as well as the New Year's group New Year greeting ceremony, will be held in the auditorium of this government at 10:00 a.m. this morning. In addition to the Security Corps, the Public Security Bureau, and the Security Committee, which should send appropriate officials to participate, all other agency staff must attend on time. Civil officials should wear formal attire, and military and police should wear uniforms. Also, starting from New Year's Day, there will be three days off as usual, etc. This is hereby informed in addition to sending separate letters. I hope you will check and instruct all your staff to participate in the celebration on time. (2) Dear Sir/Madam, I am instructed by the Mayor that the enlarged memorial week will be held in the auditorium of this government at 9:30 a.m. on January 4, 26th as usual. The Mayor will attend and report. At that time, in addition to the Public Security Bureau, the Land Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the three bureaus, and the Security Corps, which should send appropriate staff to participate, all other staff from each bureau and the military band of the Public Security Bureau must all participate, etc. This is hereby informed in addition to sending separate letters. I hope you will check and inform them. Today at 10:00 a.m., all the staff of the municipal government held a New Year's group New Year greeting ceremony in the auditorium of the municipal government. Mayor Wu gave a New Year's speech to celebrate New Year's Day. The speech and the ceremony of the group New Year greeting will be broadcast by the Shanghai Radio Station. I hope citizens will pay attention to listening. The station's call sign is XGOI, and the frequency is 900 kilocycles.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Letter to the Citizens on New Year's Day of the Twenty-Sixth Year of the Republic</h3>
<p>The way of heaven is vigorous, advancing unceasingly. The twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China has also passed with the great torrent of the times, becoming the historical trace of mankind. Today, on the day of the New Year's dedication in the twenty-sixth year, it happens to be one week after the safe return of our revolutionary leader Chairman Chiang. Getting rid of the old and bringing forth the new, from adversity to prosperity, all of us citizens, how should we recognize and shoulder the task of our great history, and invigorate our spirits to complete the great cause of the revival of our Chinese nation? This is what we should earnestly strive for in addition to joyful celebrations.</p>
<p>I, Tiecheng, have been serving as the head of this city for five years. The progress of personnel is ultimately not as easy as the passage of time. Those who gallop like this, how can they not be vigilant! At the beginning of the year, looking back at the past, the past five years have indeed given people painful lessons. The policy guidelines of the past years and their progress have been declared, so I will not repeat them here. But have the things that I have declared over the years been fully implemented? This is especially something that cannot but be faithfully reviewed. With the importance of this city's position, there are more than ten thousand things that should be promoted and reformed; especially with the sharp increase in the duties of modern government and the complexity of urban problems, I, Tiecheng, although I have tried my best and worked hard, have ultimately failed to meet the original expectations due to limited financial resources and environmental constraints. The construction of the Great Shanghai metropolis is a great undertaking for hundreds of years. The municipal government was established just ten years ago, and the distance between past achievements and future ideals is still very far. Looking forward to the future, the road is long and the task is heavy, so we should especially agree with our citizens to work harder together.</p>
<p>Governance does not lie in many words, but in burying oneself in construction; construction does not value superficial appearances, but especially values being practical and realistic. Although national affairs are in a state of rapid progress, international situations are also tense. Municipal administration is a link in the entire national policy, so its construction should naturally take national revival as the premise, so that it can be a powerful unit in the process of the entire national construction and national revival. Therefore, in recent years, what I, Tiecheng, have strived to do, in addition to the general facilities that municipal administration should have, is to combine education, upbringing, and health as a consistent principle. Although the work in the future will be varied, in essence, it should still be easy. I respectfully base myself on this purpose and offer several points, hoping that my citizens will cooperate and encourage each other!</p>
<p>[1] Regarding material construction, first, the most important thing is to actively promote the National Economic Construction Movement. Chairman Chiang has already given incisive instructions on the importance of economic construction; contemporary scholars have also discussed it a lot, so I will not repeat it here. Matters concerning the National Economic Construction Movement in this city have been planned and carried out long ago; after the start of the year, it should be promoted more actively. All the projects that were determined in previous years that have not been completed on schedule, such as the improvement of agriculture in the suburbs, water and electricity transportation, and the expansion of other public undertakings, should be strived to be implemented in reality. Secondly, the solid implementation of labor services. The labor service in this city is currently underway, with the Labor Service Committee taking full responsibility, with the goal of service being the dredging of rivers, etc. This is beneficial to water conservancy and transportation, and the livelihood of farmers. Thirdly, the preparation of a large-scale exhibition. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the municipal government. It is planned to take advantage of the grand anniversary celebration to prepare a large-scale municipal exhibition and a new industrial and handicraft exhibition, first to prosper the urban area, and second to promote domestic products.</p>
<p>[2] Regarding social construction—in addition to continuing to promote civilian welfare undertakings and improving the livelihood of civilians; other things such as the formal opening of municipal hospitals and health test institutes; the continued addition of health offices in various places; the improvement of environmental sanitation and labor hygiene; the improvement of the lives of rickshaw pullers; and the construction of public auditoriums and crematoriums were originally planned for last year. All of these things, some of which are related to civilian welfare and some of which are related to the improvement of etiquette and customs, should all be strived to be realized one by one as far as financial resources allow.</p>
<p>[3] Regarding spiritual construction—First, the continued promotion of literacy education; I have already spoken in detail about this matter before, so I will not repeat it here. Secondly, the intensified implementation of civic training. Civic training in this city has already achieved considerable success; citizens have enthusiastically participated, and their spirit is especially unexpected. This year, in order to actively improve, it is planned to open a civic training cadre training institute, select citizens with better academic ability and physical strength, give them strict training, strengthen their physique, teach them skills, encourage their spirit, and enlighten their thinking, in order to cultivate sound and promising civic training cadre talents. Enlighten their thinking, in order to cultivate sound and promising civic training cadre talents. So that future civic training will be more effective; the spirit of citizens will be more sound, and they can bear the great mission of defending the country and reviving the nation.</p>
<p>All of the above is nothing new. However, the revival of the nation depends on strengthening national power; the great cause of saving the country cannot be achieved by taking risks and fluke. Just ask about cultivation, don't ask about harvest. One point of construction, one point of national power is strengthened; one point of effort, one point of national fortune is developed. Shanghai connects the north and the south, shielding the capital. Industry and commerce are the best in the country. The spirit of the citizens has a great influence. Its relationship with the entire nation is very profound. At the beginning of the year, on the occasion of getting rid of the old and bringing forth the new, carrying on the past and opening up the future, all of us citizens should especially grasp their mission of the times, confirm their correct way of serving the country; avoid vanity, be down-to-earth, cooperate in harmony, and cooperate with all our strength; obey the entire national policy, bury ourselves in self-reliance construction, to complete the great cause of national revival!</p>

<p>The tax revenue of the customs in North China this year was greatly reduced compared to last year, mainly due to the rampant organized smuggling and tax evasion in the area, which was unprecedented. Customs anti-smuggling personnel were also unable to perform their duties as usual in the so-called non-militarized zone.</p>

<p>The principal and interest of the 1898 Anglo-German Supplementary Loan, the Boxer Indemnity, and the 1913 Reorganization Loan, which matured this year, were all paid in full from the customs revenue, totaling 76,728,395.72 yuan in national currency.

<p>Customs of the Three Northeastern Provinces</p>
<p>It must be stated that a portion of the principal and interest of the various debts and indemnities secured by customs revenue, which was previously borne by the Dalian and customs of the Three Northeastern Provinces, has not been remitted since these customs were seized in the summer of the twenty-first year of the Republic.</p>

<h3>Chen Zhonggao's Birthday Celebrations Used for Charity</h3>
<p>Initiated by Yu Qiaqing and others</p>
<p>Chen Zhonggao from Fenghua has been doing business in Shanghai for nearly thirty years. He is enthusiastic about public welfare. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, Chen was in charge of the Fenghua Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai and organized a refugee rescue team, braving the front lines without fear, and was praised by his fellow villagers. January 14th of the new year is Chen's 50th birthday, and his friends planned to celebrate his birthday. However, Chen felt that times were difficult and sternly refused. Yu Qiaqing and other leaders from Ningbo decided to use the birthday celebrations to fund the Ningbo Seven Counties Education and Welfare Center, the Yin County Relief Home Education and Welfare Center, and the Yin County Relief Home for the Disabled. Chen accepted because these institutions in Ningbo were running education, welfare, and relief programs with excellent results, benefiting his hometown, which was difficult to refuse. Preparations are underway, and the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai and the Ningbo Seven Counties Education and Welfare Center have been entrusted to collect gifts. Friends of Chen who are unaware of this can send their contributions to the above two locations.</p>

<h3>Chiang Ting-wen Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss the Xi'an Incident</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Made Absolutely No Promises to Zhang; The Aftermath of Shaanxi and Gansu Still Awaits Government Handling</p>
<p>The newly appointed Commander of the Northwest Bandit Suppression, Chiang Ting-wen, returned to Nanjing from Xi'an this time and took the night train the night before last, departing Nanjing for Shanghai. He arrived at the North Station around 7:00 AM yesterday and went directly to his private residence on Anhe Temple Road to rest. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Chiang yesterday and recorded the following conversation:</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Escape</p>
<p>According to Chiang, Chairman Chiang's confinement in Xi'an not only damaged the dignity of the leader but also ruined the honor that our country had gained internationally over the years. We met with Zhang Xueliang in Xi'an and repeatedly told him that we must not only restore the dignity of the leader but also seek to increase the dignity of the leader; we must not only restore the country's honor internationally but also seek to increase the country's honor internationally. Therefore, no conditions were discussed. If there were any opinions, they could be conveyed to the Chairman for consideration. Chairman Chiang's escape involved absolutely no written agreements or verbal promises.</p>
<p>Current Situation in Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces</p>
<p>After Zhang Xueliang arrived in Nanjing, he awaited punishment from the Central Government at the national gate. Yang Hucheng also absolutely obeyed the Central Government. Zhang and Yang's troops remained stationed in their original defense areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. Order in various places has gradually returned to normal. The subordinates of Director Zhu of the Gansu Pacification Commissioner's Office suffered many casualties in this incident. Currently, the aftermath issues in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces still await government handling.</p>
<p>Staying in Shanghai for a Medical Examination</p>
<p>I had a lot of hemoptysis in Xi'an, so I specifically asked the Chairman for leave to come to Shanghai for medical treatment. I will be admitted to the hospital for a physical examination soon and will not go elsewhere for the time being. When I will take office as the Commander of the Northwest Bandit Suppression Frontline Headquarters and whether I will go to Fujian have not yet been decided. The Chairman will return to Fenghua to handle funeral affairs for his deceased brother and take a short rest.</p>

<h3>Fang Shouyi Arrested and Interrogated for Issuing Bad Checks</h3>
<p>Sentenced to a Fine of 100 Yuan; Compensation to the Plaintiff of 5,400 Yuan</p>
<p>Fang Shouyi, 38 years old, from Fenghua, the brother-in-law of Wu Yuncheng, a director of Dahua Bank from Zhejiang (resident at No. 5, Lane 177, Luban Road), and the brother of Fang Jida (Wu Yuncheng's wife), who is currently practicing as a female lawyer in Shanghai and manager of the Nanjing Xie Ming Mining and Chemical Plant. Fang previously entrusted Ge Changhe, a Suzhou native in his twenties (resident at No. 1, Lane 5, Ximen Road) and an employee of Yuan Maoyong Gold Shop on the top floor of Citibank on Jiujiang Road, to engage in speculative business at the yarn and cotton exchange. He instructed Yang to operate yarn and cotton, limited to 500 bales. From September to early November of last year, upon settling the accounts, Fang owed Yang 5,400 yuan. On October 16th and 18th, Fang issued two checks to Yang from the Nanjing Zhongnan Bank, dated the 26th and 28th of the same month. The check dated the 26th was for 1,700 yuan, and the check dated the 28th was for 3,700 yuan. When Yang presented the checks to the Nanjing Zhongnan Bank for payment, both checks were returned due to insufficient funds. Yang sought Fang to demand repayment, but he was unable to meet him for a long time. On the day before yesterday, Fang Shouyi suddenly asked his brother-in-law, Wu Yuncheng, to go to Yang's house to demand a discounted settlement of 1,600 yuan in exchange for the two checks. Yang, feeling that he had suffered too great a loss, feigned agreement and asked Fang to come and resolve the matter together. Fang, upon hearing this, happily went to Yang's place. Yang secretly reported to the French Concession police, accusing Fang of issuing bad checks. The captain approved the accusation and sent Detective Zhang Dongcheng to arrest and detain Fang Shouyi for investigation. Fang's sister, Fang Jida, a lawyer, upon learning this, rushed to the police station and requested permission for Fang to be released on bail, but the captain refused. Yesterday, the police sent Fang to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where Magistrate Zhu Chuzhe questioned him. Fang, dressed in a Western suit with an otter fur coat, looked confident. First, Police Attorney Yuan Jiahong from the Police Affairs Department explained the case, filing charges under Article 136 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. The plaintiff, Yang Changhe, also testified about the defendant's issuing of checks and appointed a lawyer to file an incidental civil suit, requesting the court to order the defendant to repay the check amounts. When questioned, the defendant, Fang Shouyi, admitted to issuing the checks but said that there were various misunderstandings that he needed to clarify to the court. The judge stopped him, saying, "Since you admit to issuing the checks, there is no need to say irrelevant things. In Shanghai's financial circulation, the issuer should deposit the funds into the bank before the date of the check, for example, signing a check today with a date of January 15th. Otherwise, bringing it to court constitutes the crime of issuing bad checks." At this point, the court found the facts simple and clear and ordered the opening of the trial. First, the attorney from the Police Affairs Department argued, stating that the defendant had admitted to issuing bad checks, and requested that he be punished according to the law. After the defendant's lawyer, Fang Jida, and others defended him, they debated the private suit. The court immediately announced the judgment in court, sentencing Fang Shouyi to a fine of 100 yuan for issuing bad checks and intentionally exceeding his deposit. If he cannot pay the fine, he will be required to perform labor service, with 2 yuan equivalent to one day. The defendant must compensate the plaintiff 5,400 yuan in legal tender. The defendant, Fang, expressed agreement with the public prosecution judgment but disagreed with the private suit. The court ordered the defendant to provide a surety of 5,400 yuan, ready to appear when summoned, and await further instructions.</p>
<h3>Catholic Believers Pray for the Leader Today</h3>
<p>Bishop Huijiliang of the Catholic Church in Shanghai has made outstanding achievements in managing church affairs and is particularly enthusiastic in guiding believers to love their country, respect their elders, and serve society. Recently, after returning from an inspection of Changshu and Taicang, he issued a notice to his subordinates, urging believers to pray for the leader on New Year's Day. The original text of the notice is as follows: "As the new year begins, and the freezing clouds fill the sky with sorrow, we believers, although we say that human determination can overcome nature, but with sincere and fervent prayers, the benevolent God will surely be moved with compassion and listen to our prayers. Therefore, we should pray for the Pope, who deeply loves China and has been reported to be seriously ill, beseeching God to protect him and grant him long life. Here on earth, we should also pray for China, because we have a great responsibility to the Creator, to our parents, and to our country. Therefore, praying for the country is precisely to show that we are fulfilling our national duty of patriotism. In addition to thanking God for allowing our leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to escape from danger in Xi'an and return to Nanjing, we should also continue to pray for our leader, so that the already unified China, under the guidance of the leader, will become stronger and enjoy peace and happiness."</p>
<h3>A Major Robbery Occurred at Jingyun Building on Beijing Road Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Four Thieves Broke into the Building and Stole Over 4,500 Yuan; A Fierce Gunfight Ensued After Resisting Arrest, Resulting in the Death of Two Detectives and Injuries to Pedestrians</p>
<p>A major robbery occurred at Fifth Floor, Jingyun Building on 378 Beijing Road, yesterday morning around 11:20 AM, resulting in the theft of over 4,500 yuan. Detectives responded to the alarm and attempted to apprehend the robbers, leading to a fierce gunfight that resulted in the death of a Western detective and a gatekeeper detective. One robber was killed, one was captured, and stray bullets injured two pedestrians. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Large Sum of Money Attracted Thieves</p>
<p>Fifth Floor, Room 508 of Jingyun Building at 378 Beijing Road, was rented by the Liu Jingdetang Agency, a wealthy merchant from Nanxun. It included an internal and external accounting room and a reception room. Yesterday was the end of the month and near the Lunar New Year's Eve, so there was a large sum of money being handled, which attracted the attention of thieves. Around 11:20 AM yesterday morning, four men suddenly knocked on the door of the agency, falsely claiming that they wanted to rent a house at 226 Fuxiang Lane, Yunnan Road. At the time, the external accounting room knew that the house was indeed vacant and believed their story. They informed the men that the monthly rent was 88 yuan. The men said that it was too expensive and requested a lower price. The external accounting room seemed hesitant and was in the midst of negotiations when...</p>
<p>The Internal and External Accounting Rooms Were Robbed Clean</p>
<p>The four robbers immediately pulled out pistols and ordered silence. One robber retreated to guard the door of Room 508, one guarded the telephone, and the other two simultaneously forced the people in the agency into the reception room. The guard was ordered to watch over them with a gun while the other robbers demanded the keys to the safe and searched both the internal and external accounting rooms. In the external accounting room, they stole 1,000 yuan in banknotes, but they were not satisfied. They opened the safe and stole another 900 yuan in banknotes. Still unsatisfied, they rushed into the internal accounting room, opened the safe, and stole over 2,500 yuan in banknotes. In total, they stole over 4,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Tea Servants Secretly Reported; Gatekeeper Locked the Door</p>
<p>At this time, two tea servants, Wu Jinbin and Wen Akun, were returning from outside. When they reached the entrance of Room 508, they were spotted by the robber guarding the door, who ordered them to stop and forced them to wait by the fire escape with a gun. The robbers initially thought that the fire escape was a dead end, but it actually led directly to the lower floors. The two tea servants were very alert and noticed that the agency was being guarded by armed men and that people were in a panic. They sensed that something was wrong and secretly ran down the fire escape to inform the gatekeeper, Pan Shoulung, No. 2128. Upon receiving the news, Pan immediately locked the iron gate without making a sound, intending to rush to the nearby police stations on Beijing Road to report the incident and cooperate in the arrest.</p>
<p>Detectives Ascended; Thieves Descended; Encounter on Shaanxi Road</p>
<p>By chance, Western Detective Schleter, No. 2268, and Chinese Detective No. 3398 were patrolling the area. Pan immediately approached them to report the incident. The two detectives, upon hearing the news, instructed Pan to lead the way and rushed into Jingyun Building. They also instructed the elevator operator to stop the elevator on the lower floor and not allow it to go up. They immediately ascended the winding staircase with Chinese Detective No. 3398 and gatekeeper Pan Shoulung. They did not expect that the four robbers had already hidden the stolen banknotes in a paper hatbox and were exiting Room 508. Seeing that the elevator was not responding, they were also descending the winding staircase from the fifth floor and had reached the second floor. The two sides encountered each other at the corner of the winding staircase on the ground floor.</p>
<p>Two Detectives Were Killed Due to Being Outnumbered</p>
<p>When the robbers saw that they were detectives, they knew that the matter had been exposed and immediately opened fire. The Western and Chinese detectives were hit. Since there was nothing to rely on in that area, they retreated to hide by the elevator on the ground floor. In desperation, the robbers fired wildly, hoping to escape. The Western detectives guarded themselves with the existing risk, also fired three shots, and counterattacked the robbers. Because the number of detectives was too small and the robbers was to numerous, it was impossible to resist four firearms. The detectives were shot down each other step by step, and four robber bullets concentrated on the Western Detective Schleter and Gatekeeper Pan Shoulung, who recklessly resisted, were all murdered and fell near the ladder. All that remained was one Chinese Detective, No. 3398, on one side, and the robbers on the other, one pistol against four.</p>
<p>Two Thieves Captured After Concerted Pursuit</p>
<p>Seeing that the police fire was intermittent, knowing there was a casualty, the robbers took the opportunity to flee down the winding staircase, rushing out of the gate to the west. The Chinese Detective, No. 3398, also rushed out and blew the whistle loudly, calling for the alarm everywhere. Third, 165, 2975, and 3087, the Chinese detectives on duty at the nearby main street intersection, all rushed to the scene after hearing the news to jointly pursue the robbers. One thief was knocked down by the Chinese Detective, No. 2975, at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shandong Road. One thief was captured by the Chinese Detective, No. 3087, at the intersection of Shanxi Road. There were two thieves, who escaped. At this time, a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives in charge of the police station had arrived earlier to search each checkpoint closely, but they did not have a trace of the two thieves.</p>
<p>The Deceased Will Be Given a Generous Pension</p>
<p>On one side, an urgent order was issued to the fire brigade to send ambulances to Jingyun Building and the intersection of Shandong Road, and ambulances were sent to the Gongji Hospital and Renji Hospital for treating the wounded Western and Chinese detectives and one wounded robber. However, all of them died on the way due to serious injuries. Western Detective Schleter died after a bullet hit his head, and the gatekeeper's skull was injured. The seven bullets hit the dead robber's body, and a thousand yuan from the original loot as well as a pistol were found. The remains of the two detectives have been sent to the mortuary, pending reports to the Sino-British authorities and judicial authorities for verification. At the same time, the police station will give the detectives a generous pension because they died in the line of duty.</p>
<p>Bullets Flew and Injured Pedestrians</p>
<p>The arrested thief was immediately taken to the police station. Under the strict interrogation by the captain, he admitted to conspiring to rob the building, and he confessed to the hiding place of his accomplices. The detectives, escorted and escorted, went to arrest the rest of the gang. The firefight between police and thieves on the day numbered no less than forty or fifty rounds. Bullets flew and pedestrians scrambled, but there were still two people who were injured by stray bullets. One was Feng Afu, a car driver from Ningbo, who was standing in nearby Car 8023, and was thirty years old with a right chest wound. The other was Y Afu, a chartered driver, wounded with an injury in his right arm, and it was also transported by ambulance to the Renji hospital to be treated.</p>
<h3>Continued Search for Counterfeit Currency Factory</h3>
<p>Various Counterfeit Currencies Discovered; Over Forty Fake Seals</p>
<p>Liu Guangsheng, 31 years old, a native of Danyang, resident at No. 776, Bellere Road, French Concession, alias Liu Chang, was arrested on the morning of the day before yesterday near Tangjiawan, outside Laoximen, by plainclothes detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau. 50 counterfeit one-yuan bills were found, and he was escorted to the Public Security Bureau. He confessed that the factory was located at No. 6, Renchang Lane, Lanweiai Road, French Concession. Police officers were dispatched with the French Concession police. The main culprit, Zhu Yulin (also known as Zhixiang), had fled after hearing the news. Two suspects, Liu Ziting and Jiang Yuqian, were arrested, and 19 counterfeit five-yuan bills of the Central Bank, 2 counterfeit five-yuan bills of the Guangdong Provincial Exchange, 3 counterfeit ten-yuan bills of an unknown bank, 20 counterfeit five-yuan bills of the Four Provinces Farmers Bank, and counterfeit one-yuan and ten-yuan bills, a counterfeit ten-yuan bill of the China Farmers Bank, and over 40 fake seals of bank presidents and managers were seized. The individuals and evidence were transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation and verification. Orders were issued to strictly arrest the fleeing main culprit and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>British Consulate Issues Statement on the Case of the Indian Who Survived Hanging</h3>
<p>The Rope Broke Because of the Sharp Edge of the Steel Beam of the Gallows; Mr. Atma Singh Has Regained Consciousness in the Hospital</p>
<p>Shanghai, December 31 (Reuters) - Sir Brenan, British Consul-General in Shanghai, has issued the following detailed announcement regarding the case of Indian Atma Singh who survived hanging: The Board of Inquiry, after questioning several witnesses and carefully examining the rope and execution chamber, found that the rope broke because of the relatively sharp edge of the steel beam of the gallows, and that no one had secretly replaced the rope. The Board is particularly satisfied with this. The layout of the execution chamber meets all the latest requirements of the London Home Office. The rope should not be tied to the gallows beam but to the chain hook below it. The executioner came to Shanghai on the order of the Hong Kong government, but he still insisted on using his usual method of tying the rope to the beam. The beam used in the Hong Kong gallows seems to be round, while the beam used in Shanghai is not round. The executioner and others did not expect that the edge of the steel beam could cut the rope, especially since this method had been used to hang a criminal this summer and no accident had occurred. The Board believes that the incident was an accident and that no one is to blame. According to another report, Indian Atma Singh, who was hanged at Ward Road Prison a few days ago and did not die because the rope broke, regained consciousness in the police hospital yesterday morning. He was able to sit up, eat nutritious food, and talk casually with others. Judging from the current situation, there is hope for recovery. As for Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador, the decision on Mr. A's fate has not yet been announced yesterday.</p>

<h3>Zhang Wenhua and Chen Xiaobao's Appeal Rejected</h3>
<p>Xiaobao is Pregnant; Request for Bail Denied</p>
<p>Zhang Wenhua, a doctor at the Hongkou Women's Hospital at No. 290 Zhaofeng Road, and his assistant and concubine, Chen Xiaobao, were found guilty of strangling Lu Aili and Yu Gengsheng, the woman aborted and the man, with gauze on the morning of September 4th of this year and burying the bodies underground in an attempt to cover up their crime. After the case was brought to light by the Huishan Police Department, Zhang and Chen were sent to the Second Special Court. After questioning, Zhang Wenhua was sentenced to death for joint murder, and Chen Xiaobao was sentenced to life imprisonment. Subsequently, Zhang and Chen, dissatisfied with the sentence, hired lawyers Yu Enliang and Li Zhongwen to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. After questioning, the court was adjourned pending sentencing. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Presiding Judge Yu Hua, accompanied by judges Nie and Zhou, opened the First Criminal Court and announced the verdict. The main text stated: "The appeal is rejected. If you are not satisfied with this judgment, you may appeal to the Supreme Court within ten days after receiving the judgment." After the announcement, Chen Xiaobao, because she was pregnant, requested to be released on bail to give birth before being executed. The court ruled that the request was denied.</p>
<h3>Four Western-Clad Robbers Impersonate Detectives to Extort Money</h3>
<p>The victim fell for the ruse and went out to raise funds. The police received a report and surrounded the area to apprehend two men, while two others escaped.</p>
<p>Lu Ensheng, a 49-year-old Suzhou native, runs the Taifeng Silk Store at No. 21, Lane 25, Xiamen Road. At 7:45 p.m. the night before, four men in Western suits barged in, claiming to be detectives dispatched by the police to search for opium. One of them even produced a pair of handcuffs, as if to arrest Lu. Lu was greatly alarmed and tried to reason with them. The men demanded 600 yuan, but they eventually settled for 400 yuan. As Lu did not have the money, he borrowed 220 yuan in legal tender from his second landlord, Qian Xuanxian, and handed it over first. He also sent his old clerk, Xu A'er, out to borrow 200 yuan from the Jincheng Silk Store on Ningbo Road. However, on the way, Xu reported to the Chinese police that robbers were robbing his master's house, so he immediately reported it to the police. Upon hearing the report, the police urgently notified the police station by telephone. The police chief immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to No. 25, Xiamen Road, to surround No. 21 and rush in. They arrested the extortionists Gu Zhuqin from Tongzhou and Ding Jinzhi from Wuxi on the spot. The other two escaped with the money. They were taken to the police station for detention and were escorted to the First Special Court Criminal Division yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 346 of the Criminal Law and stated the facts of the case. When questioned, Ding Jinzhi confessed that he ran the Dahua Chemical Factory. In June of this year, he sold chemical towels to Lu Ensheng for 16 yuan. This time, he went with Gu Zhuqin to collect the debt, which was true, and there was no extortion or impersonation of public officials. Gu Zhuqin confessed that he was the owner of the Lida Printing House and that Ding had invited him to collect the debt the night before. Liang Bohua was hired as a lawyer to defend them. After Judge Feng verified the confessions, he ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>North Station Detective Team Captures Three Male and Three Female Kidnappers</h3>
<p>The Second Detective Team of the North Station Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned that a large number of kidnappers were hiding at No. 66, Shouxiang Lane, Fangbang Bridge, Nanshi. They dispatched personnel to work with the patrol police, and at 12:00 noon yesterday, they rushed to the scene and arrested six male and female kidnappers: Zhang Lisheng, 38 years old; Chen Guizhi, 20 years old; Peng Jincheng, 26 years old; the wife of a bandit, Lu Wangshi, 46 years old; Wang Jiangshi, 21 years old (resident of Xibaoxing Road); Wang Tangshi, 28 years old (resident of No. 5, Anding Hutong, Kang Nao Tuo Road), etc. All of them were from Liyang. They were taken to the team for interrogation and will be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Worker Shot Five Times</h3>
<p>The reason is unknown. Life is in danger.</p>
<p>Zhou Pingxiu, a 28-year-old native of Taixing in the Xitanjiadu shantytown, works for a living. At about 7 p.m. last night, he was suddenly attacked by several thugs with handguns who broke into his house and fired five shots at him. Zhou was hit by two bullets in the head and face, two bullets in the shoulder blades, and one bullet in the leg. He was seriously injured, bleeding, and fell to the ground unconscious. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the thugs fled in a rush. The Guangfu Road police station in charge of the area immediately dispatched police to hunt down the thugs, but they had already disappeared without a trace. Zhou Pingxiu was sent to the hospital for treatment by an ambulance dispatched by the police station. It is said that his injuries are critical and his life is in danger. As for the reason why Zhou was shot and who the murderer was, when asked about the Caojiadu Branch, the branch replied that they had not yet received an investigation report from the branch office, so the truth could not be ascertained.</p>
<h3>Yang Yushan and Two Others Convicted of Fraudulently Obtaining Money Through Litigation</h3>
<p>Yang Yushan sentenced to one year and two months. Wang and Sun each sentenced to eight months.</p>
<p>Yang Yushan, a Shaoxing native and owner of the Yang Fuxing firewood and coal shop outside the Shanghai Local Court, also co-founded the Zhengchi Law Firm at No. 1, Renlin Lane, Huanghe Road, in the French Concession. He engaged in soliciting lawsuits, along with Wang Bingquan, who used to set up a character-splitting stall outside the court and is now a newly appointed clerk of the court, and Sun Yuchen, who lives at No. 14, Tiande Lane, Haichao Road. In May of last year, the deputy abbot of Longhua Temple, Monk Hongkui, sodomized the temple worker Yang Shouchang and was sentenced to three years and two months of imprisonment. Yang Yushan impersonated a court clerk and fraudulently obtained 500 yuan from Hongkui's disciple, Great Monk Daheng. Unexpectedly, he clashed with Wang Bingquan, who was of the same kind. The court received a letter of accusation from Kui Fa, signed with his name. The deceased chief clerk Xuan Maohe arrested Yang. Yang also confessed that Wang Bingquan had done it. Prosecutor Mei searched the Zhengchi Law Firm and found evidence of Yang Yushan, Wang Bingquan, and Sun Yuchen jointly extorting money in the case of Du A'kang suing his wife, Ding A'ying, for adultery with Liu Linsheng. Wang and Sun were arrested and imprisoned. The court reopened the hearing and interrogated them again. The three men slandered each other. The prosecutor investigated and confirmed the facts with the victims and prosecuted them together. After repeated examinations and debates by Judge Zhang Peilu, the verdict was announced at 3 p.m. on New Year's Eve. Yang Yushan was sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment for impersonating an official and fraudulently obtaining money. Wang Bingquan and Sun Yuchen were each sentenced to eight months of imprisonment for accepting money. After the sentences were pronounced, they were ordered to be remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Dodge Trucks Arrives in Changsha from Shanghai</h3>
<p>Reaching Destination by Highway</p>
<p>Recently, the river water has dropped sharply, making navigation difficult. Heavy cargo cannot be shipped. The China Motor Company in this city just received an order from the Changsha Highway Bureau of Hunan to order two batches of Dodge trucks. The company, considering the inconvenience of water transportation, specially switched to highway transportation. The trip was 872 miles. The Dodge trucks drove day and night, taking only four days to arrive safely at their destination. However, they had to cross the river twelve times along the way. These Dodge trucks are equipped with a reserve oil tank with a capacity of 13 gallons, so even when driving through remote areas of the mainland, refueling is very economical and convenient. According to our country, Dodge is the first to deliver goods directly to the destination via such a long-distance highway. The picture shows a part of the Dodge trucks before departure.</p>

<h3>State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Establishes New Regulations on Crew Treatment</h3>
<p>From now on, promotions, demotions, and dismissals will be implemented according to the regulations.</p>
<p>The crew treatment of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established in the early years of the Republic of China, in 1934, when Liu Hongsheng was in office, and the crew leave regulations were established as a reward and punishment for diligence and laziness in service. By the end of the first performance appraisal period this year, 109 crew members had been awarded. Since Cai Zengji took over the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, at the repeated request of the driving and engine departments, a fundamental law on promotion, demotion, and dismissal was quickly established regarding crew treatment. It also stipulates the crew's salary and promotion regulations to be observed and to encourage the hearts of the people. After a long period of discussion and several bureau meetings, the treatment law was revised into 31 articles, divided into 10 chapters, and the crew's (including driving, engine, and wireless personnel) salary level, leave, promotion, advancement, punishment, performance appraisal, pension, etc. are listed in detail without omission. The crew's salary schedule has also been revised. This case is of great importance to the crew themselves. The crew's salary is divided into two types: A and B. Those who graduated from merchant marine schools and nautical colleges are classified as type A, and those who did not graduate from specialized schools are classified as type B. The payment of type A and type B salaries differs by about four levels. For the driving department, the captain of type A starts from 300 yuan to 500 yuan, and type B starts from 240 yuan to 440 yuan. The salary of a type A captain of a Yangtze River ship shall not exceed 440 yuan, and type B shall not exceed 400 yuan. The minimum salary for the chief mate is 140 yuan, and the maximum is 220 yuan. The minimum salary for the second mate is 80 yuan, and the maximum is 120 yuan. The minimum salary for the third mate is 60 yuan, and the maximum salary is 75 yuan. For the engine department, the minimum salary for the chief engineer is 160 yuan, and the maximum is 400 yuan. The minimum salary for the chief mate is 110 yuan, and the maximum is 180 yuan. The minimum salary for the second mate is 70 yuan, and the maximum is 100 yuan. The pilot's salary is from 110 yuan to 240 yuan. The salary for the probationary pilot is from 60 yuan to 120 yuan. The salary for the radio operator is from 80 yuan to 150 yuan. The salary for the assistant radio operator is from 45 yuan to 70 yuan. The salary for the trainee is from 25 yuan to 40 yuan. The salary for the driving department trainee is from 30 yuan to 40 yuan. The salary for each crew member is divided into 40 levels. Promotions and advancements are handled in accordance with the above regulations. This case has been submitted to the ministry for record and approval for implementation.</p>

<h3>Female Worker Flogged, Patrol Officer Questioned and Beaten</h3>
<p>Inside the Longmao Warehouse in Lujiazui, Pudong, a large number of female workers from various flower shops usually pick flowers. However, these female workers inevitably covet small profits and take the opportunity to steal flower clothes out of the warehouse when they leave work. Recently, Shanghai Sanyi Flower Shop, because they suspected that the police guarding the warehouse were too lax, planned to deal with the flower-stealing workers themselves. At 6 p.m. the night before, a female worker, Wu Yangshi, was found by Han Fuchang, an employee of the Sanyi Flower Shop, to be hiding a bunch of flower clothes, weighing about a few taels. He tied her to a telephone pole and flogged her. The woman screamed for help. Wang Xiangui, a pier patrol officer, stepped forward to inquire. He disagreed with Han and they had an argument. The police officer was hit and his police hat was knocked off, and his uniform was torn slightly. Wang was furious and hurried back to the Pudong Branch to report. The branch ordered Han to be summoned to the branch to inquire about the reason for the assault. That night, the compradore of the warehouse sent a letter to the branch stating that it was a misunderstanding. A storm subsided. Han was released on bail by the compradore.</p>

<h3>Suspension of Trial Proceedings in Case of Injury to Elder Relative</h3>
<p>Because of the Plaintiff's Problematic Identity, Proceedings Must Wait Until After the Third Instance Judgment</p>
<p>Yan Yuying, a woman from Suzhou, was formerly married to Liu Chengru, a wealthy merchant from Nanxun traveling in Shanghai, as a concubine. Later, because she was not tolerated by the principal wife, she left. Yan later claimed that Liu's son, Dongbin, was born to her while she was married to Liu, and applied to the court for mediation, ordering Liu Chengru and Liu Dongbin to provide support. Subsequently, the mediation was successful. Yan admitted that Dongbin was actually born to Liu's other concubine, Ban. The record was made. Yan then requested the court to confirm that Dongbin was her biological child, but the case was dismissed and finalized. Yan started another wave and requested again to confirm that the mediation record was invalid, but also failed. She is currently appealing in the third instance. Yan suddenly filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, accusing Liu Dongbin of injuring an elder relative, claiming that Liu had beaten her on the 13th of the month. The First Special Court has summoned Liu Dongbin, who hired lawyers Gao Junxiang and He Shimai to appear in court and declare that Liu Dongbin did not beat Yan. They also stated that Yan's identity had been repeatedly involved in lawsuits and had failed. Although she is now appealing in the third instance, her hopes are very slim, so she has filed this lawsuit. However, the establishment of this case depends on Yan's identity. Since the case is in the third instance, it is difficult to proceed with this case. Therefore, they requested that the proceedings be suspended. The court instructed to wait for the case file to be transferred for review. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the hearing in the First Criminal Division. Liu Dongbin was still represented by lawyers Gao and He. Judge Feng immediately announced that this case should be conducted after the judgment of the third instance, because it is necessary to consider the identity of the plaintiff, which is the key to constituting an elder relative. He then ruled that the proceedings of this case should be suspended.</p>

<h3>Chen Qiucao Painting Exhibition Opens Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Painter Chen Qiucao has devoted himself to Chinese and Western painting for eighteen years. He has always been solitary and self-respecting, and does not seek fame and fortune. He has held specialized exhibitions of pastel paintings at the Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Association and the former Municipal Government Building, which have been well received. In the autumn of 1928, he founded the White Goose Painting Society and Painting Research Institute in the North City, and published books such as the White Goose Annual, the Art Semi-Monthly, the Sketch Collection, and the Pastel Painting Collection. His paintings are vivid, the colors are strange and elegant, and they are magnificent and beautiful, with special strengths. Later, he suffered damage from the Shanghai Incident, and all his works over the years were burned. In recent years, while trying to restore the White Goose Society's affairs, he has also been deeply aware of the need to raise national awareness and extricate himself from passive concepts in art protection in the face of the dangerous situation of the country. He has worked hard to write and has gradually accumulated a lot, but he is still humble and unwilling to show it to others. This time, the Incursion Incident occurred, and all circles rose up to support it. Chen felt that it was his national duty, so he took out his recent works, including more than 100 points of ink, oil, pastel, sketch, and decorative design, and held an exhibition at the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company at the intersection of Yuqiaqing Road. He plans to donate half of the proceeds from the sale of tickets and paintings as a comfort donation. The exhibition period is set from January 2 to 10. The viewing time is from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day. Each ticket costs only one dime, and for the sake of unified reception, gift tickets are distributed in advance, and you can enter at any time with the ticket. There will be no pre-exhibition. The picture shows Chen's recent oil painting, "The Night Before the Outbreak."</p>

After careful design and multiple experiments and improvements, an extremely perfect, sturdy, and extremely cheap "flag insert" has been made. It is said that people will be sent to various merchants to sell and install it today.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Neon Light Manufacturing Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Edited by the China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>(Survey of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, No. 41)</p>
<p>㊃ Mercury: Available in all pharmacies.</p>
<p>㊄ Electrical Wire: Rubber wire is the most suitable. Each coil is approximately 100 yards and currently costs around $15. Local electrical appliance factories can manufacture their own.</p>
<p>㊅ Iron Shells and Frames: Iron shells are used to house various finished characters and designs. Iron frames are used for larger advertisements. In addition to the above raw materials, paint is also very important.</p>
<p>The manufacturing process begins with sketching and scaling up the design as needed. Glass tubes are then bent according to the design. When bending the glass tubes, gas (i.e., city gas) is used to soften the glass, and air is injected to maintain the round shape of the bend. After bending, a vacuum pump is used to evacuate the air inside the tube, creating a vacuum. Then, depending on the desired color, gas and mercury are simultaneously injected into the tube using a gas injection machine. The ends are sealed with glass bubbles, which have thin copper wires protruding, which are used to transmit electricity and are called "electrodes." Thin copper skin is used to seal both ends. The electrodes are then connected to a transformer, allowing current to pass through. This will cause the lights to illuminate.</p>
<p>Neon lights can save half the electricity compared to ordinary lights. However, they are prone to bursting during manufacturing, and one careless mistake can ruin the entire effort. In addition to the quality of the raw materials, the experience of the engineer and the proper mixing of gases are also important factors.</p>
<p>Three, Current Status of Factories</p>
<p>Currently, there are fifteen neon light manufacturers in the city. Among them, eleven are currently operating, two have ceased manufacturing but the company has not been dissolved. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>[A) Currently Operating:</p>
<p>㊀ Oriental New Red Electric Light Company: Established in the summer of the 15th year of the Republic. The factory is located at No. 18 Xinghe Li, Jing'an Temple Road, and the sales office is located at No. 407 Jing'an Temple Road. It was founded by Zhang Huikang, a prominent figure in the engineering field. Originally organized as a limited partnership company with shareholders Ren Shigang, Chen Junwu, Luo Qingfan, Qian Jichuan, Sun Tongjun, and Zhang Huikang, with a capital of 60,000 yuan. Later, due to business development, the original capital was insufficient, so in the 23rd year of the Republic, the capital was increased to 120,000 yuan, and the organization was changed to a limited company. Ren Shigang serves as chairman, with Luo Qingfan, Qian Jichuan, and Chen Junwu as managing directors. Xiang Xiamin, Sun Tongjun, Yang Jing, Wu Jinqing, and others serve as directors, and Zhang Huikang serves as both director and manager. The machinery and equipment are valued at over 20,000 yuan. In addition to the local market, sales have expanded to Pingjin, Jinghan, and other places.</p>

<h3>On China Will Not Perish (1)</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>In the past five years of severe national crisis, many patriots have been deeply saddened by the shrinking territory and the rampant violence. Consequently, they have moved from pessimism to despair, from despair to depression, and from depression to considering themselves as citizens of a doomed nation! A year ago, someone even wrote a booklet titled "On China's Inevitable Perishing," which was openly sold in the market. This kind of argument naturally suited the taste of those who considered themselves citizens of a doomed nation, so it spread like wildfire, and people competed to recite it. Now, when the national peace and unity were about to be realized, and the resistance against the enemy and the suppression of bandits were indeed on the verge of victory, the unfortunate event of Zhang Xueliang's rebellion in Xi'an, which led to the kidnapping of the nation's only leader, suddenly occurred. As a result, the mentality that China would eventually be doomed to perish has grown among some Chinese people, who believe that there is no hope for salvation.</p>
<p>In fact, China can avoid perishing, but if the false and evil rumors of "On China's Inevitable Perishing" are spread and become a public belief, then China will truly perish. Why? Sun Yat-sen said, "The nation is the accumulation of people, and people are the vessels of the heart." If Chinese people lose their self-confidence, abandon themselves to despair, and consider themselves inferior races who should be naturally eliminated, then how can China avoid perishing? Therefore, to prevent China from perishing, we should first extinguish the evil rumors of China's inevitable perishing and establish the self-confidence that China will not perish. This is a major task in establishing "psychological national defense" today.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "A country that always has enemies from abroad will perish;" and also said, "Adversity builds a nation." In these years of national crisis, we have never seen signs that China will inevitably perish. Instead, we have discovered that the opportunity for national construction and revival has been triggered by the national crisis. Furthermore, by observing the national situation in the two weeks after Zhang Xueliang's rebellion, we have discovered that our country has indeed possessed the necessary conditions for organizing a modern nation. It can be seen that the wise sayings of the ancients are absolutely true. This is not empty talk; there are facts to prove it.</p>
<p>First, the Chinese people's belief in the government and their support for the leader have become stronger day by day because of the current national crisis. We know that when a country transitions from danger and weakness to self-reliance and revival, it certainly needs great unity, and this great unity certainly needs a great leader. The power generated by the unity of the whole nation under the great leader is the power to resist foreign aggression, save the nation, build the country, and revive it. The Chinese people have thoroughly awakened in the recent five years of national crisis after the "September 18th Incident" and have eradicated the bad habit of not believing in or worshipping leaders, transforming themselves into believers and followers of the leader. At this time, if anyone publishes remarks that are suspicious or critical of the leader, any young people with national consciousness will definitely not be fooled into believing them again. Even in this rebellion by Zhang Xueliang, no matter what reasons he held, the fact that he kidnapped Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the national leader, has already made a big mistake and completely failed. The whole country, men and women, old and young, regardless of region or occupation, none does not hate the rebellious general's madness, and none does not pray for the safe return of the leader. As long as we see the joy and dancing of the people across the country on the evening of December 25th when they learned that the leader was out of danger, we can know where the public opinion lies. Because everyone feels that emerging or reviving countries such as Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Turkey have all achieved success through efforts under the guidance of a leader, and the results of our five years of arduous struggle have also been completely achieved under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. This is a clear fact. We have learned from the facts in the national crisis and deeply know that separation and disunity lead to national destruction, while unity and concerted efforts are the way to revival. Therefore, all heterodox and high-sounding arguments and divergent actions, no matter how flowery and self-aggrandizing they may be, are rejected by the national consensus and will not be allowed to exist in the country. This great achievement can be said to be entirely due to foreign aggression. Now, if one is a Chinese person who obeys commands and strives for progress, he will definitely have the self-confidence that China will never perish. And after the test of this unfortunate incident in Xi'an, the whole country unanimously condemned Zhang Xueliang and supported Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, which can further strengthen our belief that "China will not perish"!</p>
<p>Second, in the past ten years, especially in the five years of national crisis, China's national construction has made great progress. When I say this, some people must be suspicious, thinking that the territory has been occupied, sovereignty has been infringed, foreign aggression has been so serious, and emergencies can happen at any time, and people's lives and property are often subject to unexpected destruction. Under these circumstances, what progress can the country have? But I still want to say: the progress China has made in these ten years is absolutely true, and there are facts to prove it. Precisely because China's construction has progressed, it has inevitably suffered aggression from ambitious imperialist countries. In the hearts of the aggressors, they only hope that China will lag behind, regress, and never progress, so that it can be their semi-colony. Therefore, the occupation of territory, the infringement of sovereignty, the seriousness of foreign aggression, and the outbreak of emergencies are all inevitable reactions that come with China's efforts to progress. However, this kind of reaction can only be said to be the "dystocia" of the new China or the young China, and it will ultimately not be able to prevent its birth. (To be continued)</p>

HSBC's official exchange rate remained unchanged for both the U.S. and the U.K., and it was still stable. Chinese merchants and Japanese banks vigorously sold Japanese exchange. However, because the silver balance tax rose by 1 cent, the Bank of China maintained the Japanese exchange, and Japanese banks exited and re-entered. Therefore, although the Japanese exchange was firm, the process was still smooth. Moreover, foreign banks took advantage of the cheap price to accept U.S. dollars. The situation also showed a sideways trend at noon, because Japanese banks crammed out shillings, and foreign banks were also happy to take them. There was a lack of large-scale activity in the afternoon. Chinese merchants bought U.S. dollars and crammed out Japanese exchange, and the exchange was done by Japanese banks. By the closing, the selling price for the near term was 1 shilling 2 pence 53125 for the British exchange rate and 29 yuan 75 for the American exchange rate, which was the same as the previous closing price for both the U.S. and the U.K. Chinese merchants slightly crammed out.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Government Bonds Still Appear Promising at Year-End</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the government bond market was approaching the Lunar New Year's Eve. The market situation was extremely stable. The market was also affected by the end of the year, and most transactions were closed out. Due to the stability of the situation, the surface trend was quite promising, and large investors were still slowly absorbing, so the market price rose sharply. Although some bullish investors were also emerging, the overall market sentiment was promising, with no signs of weakening. Type A government bonds rose sharply again, reaching a new high of 76 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. The reason for today's opening was that it was the Lunar New Year and there would be a four-day holiday, with trading resuming on the 5th. Yesterday morning, the 35th series was actively traded, and Series E and D both rose by 5 fen to 3 jiao. Many of the Series C 50th series and others emerged, and the market price weakened by 1 jiao and 2 jiao and a half. Type A bonds were actively absorbed by the 3rd series, and the forward price rose by 5 fen. In the second session, bullish and bearish investors mutually opposed, and the market situation also tended to stabilize. Series 10 and 47 were sold, and Series 50 and 35 continued to be purchased. Except for Series C, which fell slightly by 5 fen to 2 jiao and a half, the rest all rose by 1 to 2 jiao. In the afternoon opening, the trend first weakened and then strengthened. Series E and D, such as 71 and 43, were sold and fell by about 1 jiao. After Series C, Series 50 and 5 were keenly bought, and they rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao and a half. At the closing, due to the inconsistent entry and exit of retail investors, the market price also had slight differences of 5 fen to 1 jiao, with 43 being sold more. As a result of the whole day, except for Type B and D forward bonds which fell slightly by 1 to 2 jiao, the rest all rose by 1 jiao to half a yuan. The comparison of their rises and falls, highs and lows is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Are Quiet</p>
<p>Customers are very active in futures trading. The standard yarn and cotton market is closed as usual, but spot traders still gather in the market. Spot yarn sales are still quiet, but customers are very interested in futures trading, with strong intentions. Factories are also selling a lot. According to the statistics of yesterday's purchases of spot and futures yarn by various guilds, 1,915 bales were sold, and the selling price rose by 1 yuan. The purchase amounts of each guild are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot U.S. Cotton Demand Shows Improvement</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened sluggish. However, domestic and foreign peers bought in, and there were not many sellers. The price of each month rose by 4 to 6 points. Later, cotton farmers hedged their sales and bullish investors closed out, and the market price slightly retreated. The market was unable to confirm rumors about the government selling loan cotton. There were few new buyers, and the market price did not fluctuate much. The spot market was firm, and demand also showed some improvement. The cloth market was quiet, and the closing price was stable. Spot prices rose by 9 points, and futures prices rose by 7 to 11 points. Spot British cotton fell by 7 points, and futures fell by 12 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to continued purchases by sellers, but then weakened due to cotton farmers hedging their sales and bullish investors closing out. Finally, the market price rose again due to strong buying power. The price of Pingoer rose by half a rupee, the price of Aogula fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, and the price of Bai Luo Xi remained unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left (30th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for the 31st was 231 rupees for Bai Luo Xi, 210 rupees for Aomula, and 179.75 rupees for Pingoer, all up 1.75 rupees.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>River Rice Arrivals Were Not Strong Yesterday</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were scarce due to the end of the year for the Lunar New Year. There were only more than 30 ships, of which more than 20 were Bo Dao. Transactions were mostly for social purposes, so there was no change in the market situation, and everything remained stable. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice, Yang Jian, and Yin Yuan remained unchanged. The total number of packages purchased was more than 2,000 packages of Bo Dao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various roads under the river were sparse, about 16 or 17 ships. Due to the Lunar New Year's closing, the prices offered by the shops in the market were limited, and transactions were average. The high-quality Bai Jing rice was slightly absorbed by the hoarders, and the market price was promising. The price of medium-quality Bo Dao remained stable. The price of Yang Bu Du Jian was tightened by 3 to 5 fen, and the price of Bai Yuan was close to Jiao. The prices of other goods also showed a tightening trend. Also, the north and south rice shops will be closed for three days from the Lunar New Year's Day as usual, and will open as usual on the 4th.</p>
<p>Customer Xian's Sales Are Very Smooth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the digestion of customer Xian and customer Yuan was very active, but the arrivals decreased due to the Lunar New Year, and the market sentiment was even more promising. Yesterday, the sales were entirely from purchases by the street and hoarders. Neither the north nor the south gangs inquired about it. However, the street's appetite was very greedy, and the cargo owners were not in a hurry to sell, so the price continued to rise by 5 to 6 fen to 1 jiao and a half. The total number of transactions for the day was 3,710 packages of Jiangxi rice, 2,200 packages of Hunan rice, 700 packages of Han Cao, 1,122 packages of Wen Jia Yong Shao rice, and the rest were not sold.</p>
<p>The Yellow Soybean Market Is as Booming as Usual</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yellow soybean market rose again and again. Although Dalian was closed for the past two days, private telecommunications still reported tight prices, so the market was quite booming. Oil mills and inland truckers were excited about the environment, and the arrivals and stocks were scarce. The situation seemed unlikely to ease during these three days of holiday. As a result, the market continued to rise by 5 to 6 fen compared to the previous market. The total number of transactions was 7 vehicles of Bengbu soybeans, and the price rose from 6 yuan and 1 jiao to 6 yuan, 1 jiao and a half. There were 3 vehicles of Tieling soybeans, and the price was pulled to 6 yuan, 3 jiao and 2 fen. There was 1 vehicle of Tongliao soybeans, and the price was 6 yuan, 1 jiao and 8 fen. There were 2 vehicles of Siping Street soybeans, and the price was 6 yuan, 1 jiao and a half to 2 jiao and 2 fen, and 3 vehicles of Niuzhuang green soybeans, from 6 yuan and 8 fen to 6 yuan and 4 jiao.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Silk Transactions Are Scarce Both Domestically and Internationally</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Lunar New Year's Eve, and the overseas silk market was slightly quiet. The holding prices of New York Japanese silk and Chinese silk each fell by about 2 fen. The market price of the exchange rose slightly by 1 fen to 1 fen and a half. The market in Shanghai was quite quiet yesterday, and there were few transactions with foreign firms. The silk market will not be active until the 5th of January, when Western merchants open. The Yokohama silk market will not be active until the 6th.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Merchants Are Mostly Speculating on Business on Lunar New Year's Eve - The Market Price Has Risen Without Falling</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was generally optimistic due to the continuous rise in spot and futures yarn and thread. Futures speculation was particularly strong. Japanese and foreign firms increased their selling prices. Sijunzi Serge, Juxian Village Straight Tribute Satin of domestic and foreign cotton mills increased by 1.25 li per yard, and more than 100 boxes were still traded. They were all February and March futures. The spot selling price also echoed the increase, raising 2.5 li per yard. The white goods market price was also raised by 5 fen per bolt, and the spot price was slightly lower than the futures price by about Jiao. Yesterday was the last delivery period for this month's goods, and the delivery was very busy. Dyers and wholesalers in this street absorbed fine cloth quite vigorously, and the selling price increased by 5 fen to 1 jiao per bolt. The other fine twills and raw cloth increased by 5 fen, and bleached cloth increased by 1 to 2 jiao. The price of coarse cloth, coarse twills, and blue cloth remained stable. Although the thread price was very high, Straight Tribute, Serge, and Line呢 were not active in sales, so they lacked rising power. Only the selling price of Dong goods has been brought up by futures. Various transactions in the market were mostly speculative, and the actual sales of each road were very quiet due to the Lunar New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>Yuan Fang Piece Goods Prices Are Still Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 3021st auction of Yuan Fang Foreign Company in this port. Five types of products were displayed: Western satin, Yuan velvet, straight tribute呢, feather silk, and foreign red cloth, totaling 46 brands and 62 boxes. Although the market shape coincided with the end of the year during the closing period, the bid prices fluctuated compared with the previous period, but the rise and fall were not large. Because the customer gang and the port's sales were still active, Western satin was auctioned in 5 brands. The price of Fox and Ox brands rose by 1.25 jiao per yard, and the price of Lion and Monkey brands fell by 6 fen. The two Yuan velvet brands saw slight inferiority, the straight tribute呢 rose by 2 fen, and the price of each bolt of feather silk was higher than the previous period. The Eighteen Sons brand rose by 1 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, the Butterfly Immortal rose by 1 yuan, and the Nine Linked Lanterns and Eight Soldiers brands rose by 6 to 7 jiao. The Bamboo Forest brand fell by 1 yuan, and the Haitian Ci Le, Flower Candle, Kuai Li, and 4 brands fell by about half a yuan. The rest rose or fell by 3 to 5 jiao. The foreign red cloth was 5 pounds of goods. Although it was light weight, it was the only one to show the price due to the shortage of goods in the market and the competition for purchase in the industry.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>British Tinplate Inventory Is Surprisingly Depleted</p>
<p>British tinplate has seen trading activity recently. Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Fujian and other gangs have all been buying, and manufacturers in this street have also been buying and selling a lot, so transactions have been quite strong. However, the goods are not coming in, and the inventory is surprisingly depleted. People's hearts are consolidated, and the market is expanding. The standard market price is much firmer than before. At the moment, the market price for single-linked is estimated at 21 yuan per box, and the variable-linked is sold at 41 yuan and 5 jiao. According to overseas pricing, single-linked is sold at 20 shillings and 6 pence, and variable-linked is sold at 41 shillings. It is heard that colleagues have also ordered more than a thousand boxes.</p>
<h3>Special Feature</h3>
<p>The Production, Sales, and Manufacturing of Qihong (Continued 4)</p>
<p>The price of tea fluctuates indefinitely due to changes in the foreign exchange rate, as mentioned earlier. Our country is a silver-using country, while most of the tea-consuming countries are gold-using countries. Qihong is mostly exported to the UK, so the fluctuation of the exchange rate between silver dollars and British pounds directly affects the price of tea. In the past ten years, the price of silver has fluctuated indefinitely, resulting in endless changes in the price of tea. The lower the price of silver, the higher the price of tea; conversely, the higher the price of silver, the lower the price of tea. Qihong is mainly sold to the UK, so the market price is closely related to the London exchange rate. The following table is based on the Shanghai Commodity Price Monthly's index and reciprocal of the exchange rate against London in the past eleven years:</p>
<p>Table of the Average Exchange Rate Index and Reciprocal Against London in the Past Eleven Years (1926 = 100)</p>
<p>From the previous table, it can be seen that after 1926, there was a trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap. This reached its peak in 1931, so the exchange rate index against London also fell from 100 in 1926 to 46.9 in 1931. In other words, the British pound was expensive and the Chinese currency was cheap, so even though the market price of Chinese tea in the British market was the same, the exchange rate between London and Shanghai in 1931 fell by more than half compared to 1926, so the price of tea also increased by more than double. If we observe the rise and fall of the reciprocal of the London exchange rate, it is almost completely in line with the price of tea, so we can know the deep relationship between the exchange rate and the price of tea.</p>
<p>The change in the price of tea is difficult to escape the control of the law of supply and demand, but in recent years, the world's supply and demand of black tea has already shown a trend of overproduction. The price of black tea generally trended downward, and the decline was even greater in 1933. Due to excessive inventory, the three major black tea countries of India, Sri Lanka, and the Dutch East Indies agreed to establish a production and sales restriction agreement to save the fate of black tea and maintain the price of tea, hoping to see results within five years. Since its implementation, four years have passed in an instant. Although black tea inventory has decreased slightly, it is still difficult to expect the price of tea to rise. Chinese black tea is one part of the world's black tea. The rise and fall of the market price is governed by the international market price, so the international market price of Qihong tea has not changed excessively in recent years. The reason for the rapid changes in domestic market prices in recent years is actually dominated by the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Since the government implemented currency reform on November 4 last year, the exchange rate has stabilized. For the past year, except for the exchange rates against countries such as France and Switzerland, which have changed due to changes in the currency policies of those countries, the exchange rates against countries such as the UK and the US have been able to remain unchanged. Therefore, the pain of the exchange rate affecting the price of tea in the past may not occur in the future. The market price of tea leaves will entirely depend on the supply and demand situation and quality. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Life Insurance Bimonthly</p>
<p>— Inscription by Song Hanzhang</p>
<h3>Substitute Publication Editorial</h3>
<p>— Hu Yongqi</p>
<p>The Prospects of Life Insurance in Our Country</p>
<p>The world is mutable and human affairs are uncertain. Therefore, those of us who have the obligation to support our families should prepare for a rainy day and seek security and protection as early as possible to prepare for unforeseen events and life in old age. Thus, life insurance has emerged to meet the needs of life. Marine insurance for ships and fire insurance for properties are all about preventing problems before they occur and seeking safety. However, water and fire are not constant, and human efforts are often sufficient to defend against them, and some may never encounter them in their lifetime. But human life is finite, and death is inevitable. Even with robust health, sickness and old age are unavoidable. How can there be techniques to return to youth or revive the dead? From this, it can be seen that the need for life insurance surpasses that of water and fire insurance.</p>
<p>A wise man once said, "When the people are well-off, wealth is stored among them." Furthermore, foreign economic experts also use the size of people's savings to predict the prosperity or decline of a country's financial resources. Life insurance is a system of storing wealth among the people. According to recent statistics, the percentage of the American population who hold life insurance is over 60%, and in Japan, one in every thirty people holds life insurance. The average life insurance amount held by each person in the United States is more than 1,600 yuan, while the average life insurance amount held by each person in Japan is 100 yuan. Looking back at the life insurance business in our country, only one in 10,000 people holds life insurance, and the average insurance amount per person is only a few jiao. Comparing us to them, we are far behind, and it is truly immeasurable. Since so many people in the United States and Japan hold life insurance, national construction and rural industries have been fully developed and made significant progress due to the pooling of small insurance premiums. If you don't believe me, observe what follows. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in the United States has total assets of $3,867,601,191.39, and New York Life Insurance Company has assets of $2,001,094,312.02. There are more than 300 life insurance companies in the United States. Considering only these two companies, the greatness of their assets and the abundance of their resources are difficult for financial or industrial organizations in our country to match. Japanese commercial life insurance companies have total assets of 2,175 million yuan, and the government-run postal life insurance has total assets of 759,899,900 yuan. The total assets of both government and commercial companies are more than 3 billion yuan. The assets owned by life insurance companies are mostly the premiums collected, which are entrusted to these companies to invest in the most stable industries of the country.</p>
<p>I believe that a nation must be wealthy before it can be strong, and a nation must be strong to become wealthy. This is an immutable truth. Life insurance is a way to enrich the people and strengthen the country. The United States and Japan have already set precedents for us. Although our country is currently facing both internal and external troubles, the entire nation is vibrant, and industry and commerce are showing signs of recovery. The rural economy is improving, and the life insurance industry is also on the rise. From this, it can be seen that the nation's fortunes are improving, and the nation is awaiting rejuvenation, which is truly something to celebrate.</p>
<p>Since life insurance is a way to enrich the people and strengthen the country, its development in our country will one day catch up with Europe and the United States. However, the history of life insurance in our country is still shallow, and the general public is largely unaware of it. This is nothing more than a lack of educational efforts. This association and the China Insurance Society are currently working hard on this, and the major aspects of this work are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Requesting the Ministry of Education to include insurance knowledge in primary school teaching materials. I, on behalf of this association, went to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Education to include insurance teaching materials in primary school and public education textbooks, following the example of Japan. The ministry agreed and promised to instruct various publishing houses to include it. I am very pleased.</p>
<p>(2) Requesting all university business departments to include life insurance as a required course. Life insurance is a part of economic knowledge. Business schools in universities in Europe, America, and Japan have gradually included life insurance as a required course. For example, the University of Pennsylvania and New York University have even established a major in life insurance, which shows its importance. Although business schools in our country's universities have already included life insurance in their teaching materials, it has not been designated as a required course. The association and the China Insurance Society have sent letters to various universities, requesting that life insurance be included as a required course for business students to promote it.</p>
<p>(3) Conducting publicity in daily newspapers. To popularize general knowledge of life insurance, this association is conducting joint publicity efforts in the Shen Bao newspaper. In addition to publishing advertisements with educational significance, a special issue is also compiled to spread information, so that the people of the country can understand life insurance and share the joy of personal and family protection.</p>
<p>(4) Improving the level of practitioners. Life insurance enables people to use appropriate economic means to seek protection for their personal and family well-being. Therefore, life insurance practitioners are essentially economic advisors to families, ready to provide consultation to the public. If practitioners themselves have only a superficial understanding of life insurance, how can they bear this important responsibility? Therefore, life insurance practitioners should first have sufficient training and rich knowledge to be worthy of their mission. This association and the China Insurance Society are currently planning to establish a circulating library for research by practitioners.</p>
<p>In short, our educational efforts do not focus on empty talk but are based on facts, so that everyone knows that life insurance is a necessary condition beyond food, clothing, housing, and transportation, and recognizes that taking out life insurance is a personal responsibility.</p>
<p>The field of life insurance in our country is exceptionally vast. With appropriate educational efforts, it will surely develop rapidly. Our Chinese commercial colleagues are especially loved by the people of the country, which is naturally expected. The warm welcome that various Chinese companies have received from the people of the country in the past twenty years is enough to encourage us to strive for the prosperity of our industry. I sincerely hope to cooperate with colleagues and those who study insurance to encourage each other, thoroughly implement this important mission, and live up to the expectations of the people, so that the life insurance industry can become a powerful financial institution in the country, reaching the current prosperity of the United States. Then, the protection of personal and family well-being and the progress of national construction will greatly benefit from it.</p>
<h3>An Analysis of the Meaning of Life Insurance</h3>
<p>— Guo Peixian</p>
<p>What is life insurance?</p>
<p>American economist Allan H. Willet said: "Life insurance can transfer the dangers of many people to one person or a group of people. It is a social strategy of accumulating funds to prevent uncertain losses from premature death."</p>
<p>American insurance guru S.S. Huebner said: "From an individual's perspective, life insurance is a contract in which the insured pays premiums, and if he dies or encounters other specified events, the insurer compensates him or his beneficiary with a certain amount of insurance."</p>
<p>Japanese scholar Hidematsu Tsumura said: "Insurance is a group of people who worry about similar dangers, uniting to share the losses that arise among them."</p>
<p>Although the above definitions use different wording, their meanings are essentially the same. In short, life insurance is a scientific method of transferring an individual's life risks to a group of people, so that each person bears a small premium loss, rather than a major loss of life.</p>
<p>In insurance terms, anyone whose life or death is the subject of insurance is called the insured; the person who enters into the insurance contract with the insurer is called the policyholder; and the person who enjoys the benefits of the contract is called the beneficiary. Life insurance is a bilateral, compensatory contract in which the policyholder pays the insurance premium, and if the insured dies or an insured event occurs, the insurer compensates the policyholder or its designated beneficiary with the insurance amount.</p>
<p>Based on the above definition, we can see that the content of life insurance has the following basic meanings:</p>
<p>(1) Uncertainty of Risk. The word "risk" is originally an abstract noun, but in the insurance industry, it is often used to refer to the subject of insurance, such as life, houses, ships, goods, etc. The life risk insured by life insurance must be uncertain. "Uncertain" means that the occurrence of the risk cannot be predicted, and the cause of the occurrence is not automatic. For example, conspiring to harm the insured's life in order to collect the insurance money is a predetermined risk, and the insurer is not liable for compensation. Also, if the insured commits suicide intentionally, it is an automatic risk, and the insurer is generally not liable for compensation unless the insurance has been in force for more than three years.</p>
<p>(2) Clustering of Risks. The risks insured by life insurance must belong to the same category (Homogeneous), that is, the age and physical condition of the insured must be roughly the same, because the premium calculation is proportional to the degree of risk, and the measurement of the degree of risk is based on the age and physical condition of the insured. The degree of risk varies between older people and younger people, healthy people and weak people. It is necessary to distinguish between old and young, strong and weak, and calculate the premium to have a standard. Therefore, insurance companies either refuse to insure people who are too old, or increase the premium, or shorten the insurance period. For the insured, they must first examine their physical condition. If they are thin and weak, they are listed as a substandard risk (sub-standard), and a special premium is added before they can be insured, or it is agreed to reduce the insurance amount (Risk).</p>
<p>(3) Transfer of Risk. Everything in the universe, in all its variety, seems unpredictable and inscrutable when observed individually. However, if we extend the observation time and expand the scope of observation, we can often discover laws from the chaos. What life insurance insures is not the individual, but the group of individuals; not the individual's individual loss, but the overall average loss. The death of an individual is accidental, but the death of an individual in a group is not accidental. Although there are differences in the order of death, on average, the number of deaths is very fixed. However, there must be many insured people to fit the law of averages in order to predict the number of times risks occur. Statistical experts have compiled statistical tables based on experience to show how many people of the same age die on average in a year. For example, the American Experience Mortality Table, which is commonly used by general life insurance companies in our country, contains the experienced mortality rate from the age of ten to the age of ninety-five. Based on the mortality table, the insurance company can calculate in advance how much compensation it must pay each year, and at the same time calculate how much premium it should charge each person in order to compensate for the losses of the deceased. In this way, a fixed premium loss can replace an uncertain death loss.</p>
<p>(4) Determination of Premium. The premium collected by life insurance, except for term insurance, must be returned to the insured or the beneficiary when the insurance expires or the insured dies. Therefore, life insurance companies have accumulated funds in advance to prepare for compensation for losses. The more adequate the accumulation of reserves, the more secure the insured's protection. The accumulation of reserves must be in accordance with the provisions of the law and scientific methods. The reserve comes from the premium. The collection of the premium should not only vary according to age, but also differ according to the type of insurance policy and additional conditions. The premiums currently collected by life insurance companies are mostly evenly distributed over the insurance period, that is, from the first few years of insurance, an average premium is collected, which is more than what is needed at that time to compensate for losses and pay expenses, in order to accumulate a reserve fund to prepare for the years when deaths increase sharply and income cannot meet expenditures.</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, we should recognize the true meaning of life insurance, which is not to guarantee immortality, but to guarantee the loss of productive capacity. Huebner said: "Life insurance is the only way to capitalize life value and compensate for it." In other words, life insurance can extend the productive capacity of the unfortunate, so that it still has capital value after death to maintain the lives of dependents. For families that have life insurance, although the head of the family dies, the family income remains unchanged, and family members can still live as usual, without freezing or starvation and ending up in a ditch. If there is no insurance or savings after death, once the person who earns a living dies, the family will inevitably fall into a tragic situation.</p>
<p>The basic meaning of life insurance lies in the dispersion of life risk burdens and the compensation for the loss of productive capacity. It can turn the uncertain dangers of life into something certain, so that we can live a stable life, feel comfortable physically and mentally, not worry about poverty in life, and not worry about support after death. It is truly the only good way to protect personal and family life. Therefore, all people with family responsibilities should take out life insurance as a guarantee for family happiness.</p>
<p>Protecting Individual Production and Promoting Social Tranquility</p>
<p>— Lin Sen</p>
<h3>My Opinion on Wives of Bank Employees Urging Their Husbands to Buy Life Insurance</h3>
<p>— Tan Yunshan</p>
<p>Due to the influence of different environmental stages, there are differences in the thoughts and behaviors of men and women in humanity. Men mostly have more definite thoughts and behaviors only after the age of thirty. Women, however, are a bit earlier. Mostly at the age of twenty-four or above, they already have very definite thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, since ancient times, men have had a kind of "internal help" recognition of women. Assuming a very romantic man, if he gets a woman with good thoughts and behaviors to be his wife, perhaps she can correct her husband's thoughts and behaviors. This recognition has been jointly acknowledged by mankind across the entire continent for a very long time. Modern thought seems to feel a bit of a choke on the term "internal help." Especially young women often stand at the forefront of opposition. In fact, these are all small mistakes. There is no recognition of the stage of human life—the meaning of eugenics. The stage of human life is absolutely not like modern semi-artistic romanticization and suicidalization. The stage of human life is absolutely about seeking true, beautiful, and good happiness for a family. To seek true, beautiful, and good happiness for a family, there must be a strategy to guarantee the economy. There are thousands of strategies to guarantee the economy. However, "life insurance" is the first best strategy. This strategy is especially suitable and necessary for bank employees. Because,</p>
<p>(1) Bank employees always check more banknotes and coins than employees of other businesses due to their service. Therefore, the accumulation of unclean traces on the fingertips is also more. Banks deal with banknotes and coins worth tens of millions every day. These banknotes and coins often adhere to mold. This mold is the medium for spreading diseases. Although bank employees often wash their fingers with clean water, according to research by famous doctors at home and abroad, many molds absolutely cannot be eliminated by washing with cold water. They must be washed in boiling water for a certain period of time, or rubbed with disinfectant, to kill them. The more opportunities bank employees have to touch banknotes and coins, the more they are exposed to mold. If they are not careful and touch food with their hands, the mold will be brought into the stomach and intestines. There is a possibility of growth at any time. Assuming special precautions are taken for the fingertips to prevent mold from entering the internal organs, bank employees must check the number of banknotes and coins one by one when paying and receiving them, and observe their authenticity. Therefore, the mouth, nose, and eyes are very close to the banknotes and coins. They are often infected by banknotes and coins touched by people with infectious diseases. This is so dangerous. Bank employees absolutely cannot work all day long with masks. If they do not wrap them in masks, they often inhale mold when checking banknotes and coins, or because of breathing through the mouth and nose. Therefore, the lives of bank employees are always more terrifying and short-lived than ordinary people.</p>
<p>(2) Bank employees have heavier work in managing and handling incoming and outgoing accounts, money, banknotes, checks, and drafts than ordinary commercial employees. They cannot be careless at all. Otherwise, they often suffer huge losses due to temporary negligence. Therefore, the energy and effort spent are also more than ordinary store employees. Since banking affairs are extremely painstaking and require a lot of energy, bank employees are also more likely to suffer from anemia.</p>
<p>(3) Bank employees often indulge in pleasures and put family responsibilities behind their minds because of their relatively affluent environment. Or, they engage in speculative ventures. Once they fail, they are financially ruined and discredited, often leading to tragic suicides.</p>
<p>(4) Because bank employees are subject to the constraints of bank order, their common sense is often limited to the scope of the bank. Once they lose their jobs, before they have the opportunity to rejoin the bank, not only do they personally experience the taste of unemployment, but also unemployment affects the bankruptcy of the family economy.</p>
<p>The above are all the most important characteristics of bank employees. Bank employees should be aware of this as early as possible and move towards the lifeline of "life insurance." However, romance is the nature of men, especially general well-informed bank employees. Therefore, I very much hope that the virtuous "internal helper" of the bank employee can guide her husband to obtain the protection of "life insurance" at all times.</p>
<h3>News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Insurance Industry Association submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to instruct major bookstores to compile insurance teaching materials into elementary school textbooks and sent letters to universities and specialized schools to establish insurance departments in order to popularize insurance knowledge and cultivate insurance talents. The submission and special letters are recorded below.</p>
<p>(1) Submission to the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>Submitting a request to issue a notice to major bookstores to include an insurance course in elementary school textbooks so that insurance knowledge can be widely disseminated, thereby protecting people's livelihoods and maintaining thrift, and respectfully requesting review and implementation. Insurance is used to collect funds from the public to prevent unforeseen disasters for individuals. Disease and death, who can escape? Water and fire disasters, where do they not exist? If there are insurance facilities, individual personal and family property can be adequately protected, and social wealth can be increased and circulated. From this perspective, the insurance industry has infinite help in cultivating thrift, protecting people's livelihoods, developing wealth, and stabilizing society. It is understood that education authorities in Europe and the United States attach the same importance to training young people, instilling insurance knowledge, and promoting savings campaigns. The intentions involved are very clear. Recently, the Japanese Ministry of Education also included an insurance course in elementary school textbooks, also intending to popularize this excellent knowledge in the minds of young people, so that they can achieve twice the result with half the effort in the development of people's livelihoods and the cultivation of thrift, without falling behind European and American countries. Recently, Chairman Chiang issued the organizational outline of the New Life Movement Labor Service Corps, which specifically stipulates the fifteenth item as promoting savings and insurance campaigns, which shows the importance attached to insurance. In recent years, people's livelihoods in our country have declined, and customs have become extravagant. The education policy is to develop people's livelihoods and promote thrift as a remedy. It is found that the insurance industry is in line with this education policy, and it is appropriate to widely instill insurance ideas in young students in order to achieve practical results. Our association previously submitted a request to your department to issue a notice to major bookstores to include an insurance course in elementary school textbooks, but no instructions have been received on file. It is now learned that elementary school textbooks of various bookstores are currently being revised under orders, so Hu Yongqi is specially dispatched to submit a document to your department, humbly requesting approval as requested, and to issue a notice to major bookstores to include an insurance course in elementary school textbooks, so that insurance knowledge can be widely disseminated, thereby protecting people's livelihoods and maintaining thrift, which is convenient for the public. Respectfully submitted to Wang, Minister of Education.</p>

<h3>New Year's Message for the 26th Year</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Last New Year's Day, the author wrote an article in this publication titled "New Hopes for the Telecommunications Industry," expressing boundless hopes from the perspective of the telecommunications sector for both the nation and society. Time flies, and a year has passed in an instant. In this past year, our new hopes have, in fact, been largely realized: the consolidation of world peace, the stability of the domestic political situation, the development of the national economy, the support of the political and military authorities for telecommunications, the concerted cooperation of people in society, and the organization of electrical material factories by entrepreneurs—all of these have a significant relationship with the telecommunications industry and are what we have been praying for day and night. This New Year's Day, in addition to hoping that the achievements of the past year will be maintained and promoted, we have the following goals for the nation and our industry, which will be the focus of our hopes and efforts this year:</p>
<p>A. Regarding the Nation</p>
<p>㊀ Consolidating Central Authority: Since the resolution of the Liangguang issue, the central authority has been unified, and its international standing has improved considerably. However, if there are overlapping or conflicting matters between the central government and the provinces, they should be resolved in accordance with central laws and regulations to avoid the drawbacks of redundant construction and piecemeal development. If the central authority is not consolidated, each province will act on its own, and each person will seek personal gain, leading to waste of manpower and resources in peacetime and mutual obstruction and shirking of responsibility in wartime. With inconsistent command and inflexible coordination, it will be difficult to achieve effective defense and survival. For example, all long-distance telephone services operated by provincial governments should be managed by the Ministry of Transportation this year.</p>
<p>㊁ Supporting the Great Achievements of Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek: The safety of the nation hinges on him, and we should undoubtedly support him. However, support should be demonstrated through action, not just empty words. Our colleagues in the telecommunications industry handle the telegrams sent by Chairman Chiang with utmost care and speed, demonstrating our support in practice. I recall last October, when celebratory telegrams poured in like snowflakes, our colleagues in various bureaus worked overtime and enthusiastically participated. Even during the Xi'an Incident, when telegrams related to rescuing Chairman Chiang were sent, all bureaus made every effort to send them despite the blocked lines, ensuring the Chairman's safe escape. Although this is our duty, we are all motivated by the leader's spirit and are willing to work hard without complaint. In the future, our colleagues should work even harder and strive for the country.</p>
<p>B. Regarding the Industry</p>
<p>㊀ Developing International Telegraphs: Since the establishment of international radio stations and the subsequent establishment of direct circuits with various countries, most of the rights and benefits of international telegraphs have been recovered. However, there are still a few people who are unaware of the excellent communication efficiency and meticulous business maintenance of international radio stations. From today onward, we hope that all people nationwide, when sending telegrams abroad, will add the phrase "Via Cgra" in the annotation column. This is a simple act for individuals but gives the nation the right to collect fees for sending telegrams. In other words, sending one more telegram "Via Cgra" adds one more point to national strength.</p>
<p>㊁ Promoting the Use of Telegraphs: The benefits of using telegraphs are countless, especially during the end of the year, when it is a convenient communication tool. The Ministry of Transportation has spared no effort in streamlining telegraph services in recent years to facilitate the public. The rates for domestic telegrams have been reduced several times, and since last September, telegrams within the province have been reduced by 30%, which is the biggest sacrifice in telecommunications economics. We hope that people across the country will support the spirit of improvement by the telecommunications authorities and universally use telegraphs as a communication tool, so that they will be worthy of the demeanor of modern citizens.</p>
<p>㊂ Completing the Long-Distance Telephone Network: The long-distance telephone service run by the Ministry of Transportation made significant progress last year. The number of locations with telephone service increased by 104 compared to 1935, the number of calls increased by 77,775 compared to 1933, the length of the lines increased by 18,013 kilometers, and the number of circuits increased by 37,531 kilometers. However, as the construction of various lines is still in progress and the amplifier stations in various locations have not yet been fully installed, nationwide communication has not yet been opened. We hope that this year, we will make the greatest determination and effort to complete the above projects in the shortest possible time, so that all parts of our country will be closely connected and responsive to each other, making a great contribution to politics, military affairs, economy, and culture.</p>
<p>The above is the minimum of what we hope to achieve in the new year. We do not engage in empty talk or indulge in fantasies, but only work hard under the guidance of competent officials and the supervision of the public to fulfill our responsibilities to the nation and our industry. As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves," and "Human determination can overcome nature." We offer these words as our New Year's greetings.</p>
<h3>Use of Telegrams During the Accounting Period</h3>
<p>Time flies, and the commercial accounting period is fast approaching. Businesses that have transactions with counterparts in other locations or other companies will certainly send their bills to the other party in advance to facilitate contact. However, for those in distant locations, postal delivery takes a considerable amount of time, which is often too slow to be of use. During the accounting period, businesses need to settle various accounts, both those owed and those owing, and they are in dire need of funds. Therefore, they must adopt the fastest communication methods to collect accounts from related businesses in other locations. Sending telegrams is the fastest and most convenient communication method available today, and it can fully demonstrate its effectiveness, especially during the commercial accounting period. Now, let's discuss its uses as follows:</p>
<p>1. Telegrams for Collecting Debts: Since telegrams are the fastest communication method, all commercial telegrams sent by businesses to various locations, whether transmitted via wire or wireless telegraph, can be delivered as soon as they are sent, reaching all corners of the country. If businesses use telegrams to collect accounts from related businesses in other locations, no matter how urgent the matter may be, the message can be delivered to the other party almost instantly, making it extremely fast and convenient. For example, a telegram stating: "Yida Silk Store, Yuanwei Road, Tianjin: Your account shows a balance of (3562) yuan. Please remit immediately to Weicheng Factory." After the telegram is delivered to the recipient business by the telegraph office, if the business verifies that the account amount stated in the telegram is correct, it can remit the funds immediately. Even if the deadline is very close, regular remittances cannot arrive in time due to the time required for postal delivery. If the account is transferred by telegraph through a bank or postal savings and remittance bureau, it can arrive on the same day. It is clear that businesses using telegrams to collect accounts have an unexpected effect. The method of using telegrams to collect accounts has long been practiced by businesses in Europe and the United States and has achieved remarkable results. Major businesses in our country can emulate this method to avoid the time-consuming nature of sending bills by mail, which can be too slow to be of use.</p>
<p>2. Telegraphic Transfer of Accounts: After receiving an account from a business in another location, if a business remits the account through a bank and estimates that it will not arrive before the end of the accounting period, it can remit the account by telegraph through a bank or postal savings and remittance bureau for the sake of speed. No matter how far away the distance is, it can be delivered as soon as it is sent, which is extremely fast and convenient. After receiving the account, the other party business will certainly have a good impression of the business's prompt remittance by telegraph. Therefore, businesses in various locations, during this accounting period, should find telegraphic transfers both quick and convenient, and also use this to enhance commercial credit. It can be seen that the use of telegraphs in commerce is extremely broad.</p>
<p>3. Using Telegram Receipt Method: The telegraph receipt return method recently implemented by various telegraph offices also has considerable benefits for telegrams related to accounting. When businesses send telegrams to collect accounts, if they add the "return receipt" indicator in the telegram base, once the telegram is properly delivered by the receiving telegraph office, the telegraph office must send the "telegram receipt received" with the signature or seal of the recipient to the business that sent the telegram. After receiving the receipt, the sending business can be sure that the telegram sent by this business has been signed for by the receiving business and can estimate when the account remitted by the receiving business can be received. Also, if businesses indicate "return receipt" in the telegramic transfer of accounts, after the telegram is delivered to the recipient, the telegraph office must send the "telegram receipt received" with the signature or seal of the recipient. The business that sent the telegram can use the "telegram receipt received" with the signature or seal of the receiving business as proof of receipt of the account. If there is no formal receipt when accounting, it is also possible to attach the "telegram receipt received" to the account book. This is another use of telegrams during the accounting period.</p>
<p>4. Using Telegrams to Check Accounts: If an individual or business receives an account from a business in another location and, after verifying, finds that the amount listed in the account does not match the amount listed in the individual's or business's books, it is appropriate to inquire clearly in advance to settle the account. However, businesses send out bills in the days before the holiday season. Therefore, after the account is received, if there is a discrepancy in the amount of the account, those who are far away will certainly not have enough time to send a letter to inquire. If telegrams are used, no matter how short the time is, inquiries can still be made back and forth. The amount of the account can be reconciled in a short period of time, which is extremely fast and convenient.</p>
<p>5. Telegraphic Demand for Overdue and Mortgage Loans: During the accounting period, if businesses find that there are outstanding and overdue amounts due from businesses in other locations, they must find ways to collect them to clear the accounts. The quickest way to collect these is to use telegrams. Also, banks, money houses, etc., can use telegrams to collect overdue mortgage loans from other locations during this accounting period, and they can hopefully collect them all before the holiday season. Otherwise, the exchange of letters will take too long.</p>
<p>6. Telegraphic Demand for Payment of Forward Goods: If businesses have forward goods ordered by businesses in other locations that have not yet been paid for and shipped by the due date, it is also appropriate to find ways to urge the other party to pay during the accounting period to avoid delays. The most effective way to urge this is to use telegrams. If the other party business comes to pay and ship the goods immediately after receiving the telegram, then during the accounting period, this additional amount of goods and money can be used for turnover, which will also be beneficial to finance.</p>
<p>In summary, the use of telegrams during the commercial accounting period is very extensive and is not limited to the above points. During the commercial accounting period, if businesses can make full use of telegrams and allow them to fully demonstrate their function, they will surely benefit commerce greatly. I hope that businesses will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Two New Methods for Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Service from the Ministry of Transportation</h3>
<p>— Pu Zhan</p>
<p>New Contributions for the New Year</p>
<p>1. If a local telephone subscriber has already registered the telephone set installed with the telephone company and paid the long-distance telephone deposit (or has completed the application to connect to the long-distance telephone service), and needs to borrow another unregistered telephone set (regardless of whether it belongs to the subscriber) to transmit a long-distance telephone call, and requests that the long-distance call charges be recorded and paid on the subscriber's already registered telephone bill, the telephone company can also handle it. However, the borrowed telephone set is limited to being within the same local telephone service area as the subscriber's already registered telephone set. The registration procedures are specified as follows:</p>
<p>(A) If a local telephone subscriber applies to the telephone company in writing prior to using another phone to make a call: the caller should use the name of the subscriber who has registered to transmit a long-distance telephone call and provide in writing the subscriber's registered telephone number, the other telephone number that is intended to be borrowed to transmit the long-distance telephone call, and the name of the person borrowing the telephone to apply to the telephone company to have the charges for all long-distance telephone calls made by the specified caller using the other telephone included in the subscriber's registered telephone bill for payment. After obtaining written permission from the telephone company, the specified caller can borrow the other telephone set to make long-distance telephone calls according to the registration procedures for various types of calls stipulated in Article 11 of the Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Service Regulations. However, when registering the call, the caller should specifically state that it is a borrowed telephone call, and the charges should be recorded on the telephone bill of the subscriber's telephone number, and the caller's name, so that the telephone company can handle it accordingly.</p>
<p>(B) If a local telephone subscriber borrows a telephone to make a call temporarily without applying to the telephone company in writing prior to the call:</p>
<p>㊀ The caller should first notify the telephone location that the caller has registered with from the borrowed telephone, informing them that the caller intends to borrow a certain telephone number to transmit a long-distance telephone call to a certain place, and instruct them to wait. When the telephone company calls to inquire, they should acknowledge that they are willing to pay the call charges;</p>
<p>㊁ The caller should register the call with the telephone company from the borrowed telephone set according to the registration procedures for various types of calls stipulated in Article 11 of the Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Service Regulations, and inform them of the borrowed telephone number, requesting that the call charges be recorded on a certain telephone bill for payment, and state that the telephone location of a certain number has been notified;</p>
<p>㊂ After the caller registers the call, the telephone company will immediately call the telephone number designated by the caller to pay the charges and ask if they agree to have the payable call charges recorded on their bill for the long-distance telephone call that someone is currently trying to transmit to a certain location from a certain telephone set. If it is approved, the telephone company will connect the long-distance telephone call to the telephone set borrowed by the caller and record the call charges on the telephone bill designated by the caller to pay. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Problem of Long-Distance Telephone Cancellation (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jiong</p>
<p>Also, if the receiving subscriber has been called by the receiving telephone company, but the receiving telephone company cannot call back the sending telephone company to transfer the call to the sending subscriber due to a sudden failure of the line or equipment, the sender can also request free cancellation.</p>
<p>(B) Unnecessary Repeated Calls: If a caller applies to the telephone company to register a call to a certain person in a certain location or a certain telephone number in a certain location, but the receiving subscriber happens to call first, resulting in communication first, so that it is no longer necessary to call the receiving subscriber, a free cancellation can be requested from the telephone company in accordance with regulations.</p>
<p>(C) Waiting Too Long: If a caller registers a call with the telephone company, but the caller has waited for two hours for an ordinary call or one hour for an urgent call due to congested lines and busy telephone traffic, and has not yet been able to connect to the other party, and requests cancellation, the telephone company can waive the cancellation fee. Also, for calls that have already been dispatched to the receiving telephone company to page the receiving subscriber, the cancellation fee is still charged in accordance with regulations. If the caller does not want to make the call for some reason and requests cancellation, the cancellation fee should still be charged, but only within the above-mentioned waiting time.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned situations in which calls cannot be connected are caused by equipment and line failures or congested lines and busy telephone traffic, so the caller can request free cancellation.</p>
<p>The cancellation fee between a certain location and a certain location is the same for all types of calls. The calculation method is based on the amount of the call charges. According to the regulations in the newly revised Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Classification Tariff Comparison Table (this comparison table and the Ministry of Transportation's Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Service Regulations can be obtained from the local telephone company), the cancellation fee for ordinary called-number calls with call charges from 10 cents to 50 cents is 10 cents; the cancellation fee for call charges from 60 cents to 1 yuan is 20 cents; the cancellation fee for call charges from 1 yuan and 10 cents to 1 yuan and 50 cents is 30 cents. And so on. For example, the ordinary called-number call from Nanjing to Suzhou costs 90 cents each time, so the cancellation fee should be 20 cents. (End)</p>

<h3>World Peace and China</h3>
<p>— Yu Songhua</p>
<p>The year 1936 has passed yesterday, and the new year of 1937 begins today. At the beginning of this new year, when we observe the world situation and China's position, we cannot but pay considerable attention to the issue of world peace, which is of concern to the whole world.</p>
<p>The prophecies of the war crisis of 1936 and newspapers and magazines from our eastern neighbor have been warning repeatedly since the September 18th Incident. In the past year, there was indeed the protracted Spanish war in Eastern and Western Europe, and there were also the turbulent events in Suiyuan in the East. Fortunately, a large-scale international war and massacre did not break out.</p>
<p>Although a large-scale international war did not take place last year, the crisis of a major war has not disappeared with the old year. Leaving aside other things, the collusion between Italy, Germany, and Japan, and the many complicated and difficult-to-resolve Sino-Japanese issues are enough to increase the world's crisis. Those countries that hold an aggressive ideology have other intentions, and there is a sense that they will not be satisfied unless the whole world is drawn into the vortex of a major war. The increase in military budgets and the active expansion of armaments in various countries are clear evidence of this. Fortunately, those who love peace in the world have been persistent in promoting peace, hoping to avert the world's catastrophe, so the unprecedented war disaster has not yet broken out in one day. Judging from the development situation, the growth and decline of aggressive forces and peaceful forces will probably be decided in this year. This is what the objective situation shows, and it is also what those who care about the world peace issue are anxious about.</p>
<p>In this international environment, if China wants to save itself from subjugation and strive for survival, it must strive for peaceful construction internally to enrich the country's strength, and it must be prepared to make great sacrifices externally to deal with the arrival of aggressive forces. This understanding has now become a common understanding among the Chinese people. The Liangguang Incident last year and the recent Xi'an Incident were all resolved peacefully. Since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, the soldiers on the front line have fought bravely and hard, and the people in various places have unanimously provided enthusiastic assistance. If there was no deep awareness and understanding of the correct steps for saving the country from subjugation and striving for survival, how could the whole country, from top to bottom, have achieved this! This is truly a major step forward for China. If we can continue to proceed in this way in the future, China's future will gradually improve. However, the international situation is unpredictable, and the pressure from foreign forces on China is increasing day by day. China's current environment is extremely difficult and dangerous. A slight carelessness can lead to the disaster of subjugation. This is also an undeniable fact. Therefore, being cautious, as if treading on thin ice, is the attitude that the Chinese people should adopt, and working hard to overcome difficult and dangerous environments is also the responsibility that the Chinese people should fulfill. Here, the reporter dares to offer three points as humble suggestions.</p>
<p>First, strive in one's own position. Gu Tinglin once said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." Because loving and saving the country depends on everyone's efforts. At present, China's salvation from subjugation and struggle for survival also starts with everyone fulfilling their responsibilities in their respective positions, contributing their beneficial strength to society and the country. If everyone and every job can do their best in their division of labor and cooperation, and combine to form a great force, then the national crisis may not be insoluble, and China's goal of freedom and equality may gradually be achieved. This is why striving in one's own position cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Second, prepare for extraordinary times. All life and all habits are very different in extraordinary times and normal times. If there is no preparation for extraordinary times in normal times, it is inevitable that there will be panic and chaos in emergencies. Whether China and the Chinese nation can turn misfortune into good fortune and turn danger into safety in extraordinary times depends on whether we have prepared for extraordinary times in normal times. Moreover, normal times and extraordinary times are not completely separate. Laxity in normal times often leads to the roots of disaster in emergencies. Only by treating normal times as extraordinary times, being vigilant at all times, and striving everywhere can we calmly deal with extraordinary times and cope with them with ease.</p>
<p>Third, concentrate will and strength to be united against foreign countries. In recent years, the Chinese people have a deep understanding of the importance of peaceful construction. Therefore, the greatest obstacle to China's peaceful construction in the future is not internal, but the pressure from foreign forces. If this pressure can be removed, the progress of peaceful construction will surely be rapid. This can be said with certainty. However, removing this pressure is not an easy task. It is difficult to succeed without concentrating the will and strength of the whole country on this one point. The enemy deeply fears China's unification, and often takes the strategy of division and piecemeal destruction to deal with China. The purpose is nothing more than to destroy our national united strength against foreign countries. From this, it can be seen that if we want China to be liberated from the oppression of foreign forces, concentrating will and strength and being united against foreign countries is the most effective strategy.</p>
<p>Saving the country should originally be done from many aspects, and the above three points are only abstract principles. However, if we do not talk about saving the country, and we sincerely want to reach the goal of saving the country through effort, then I believe that these three points are the guide for our efforts, and following this to seek the development of various concrete facts will surely lead to a bright future for the country and individuals. Saving the country is not the responsibility of unusual people, but only requires everyone to move forward towards the correct goal, pooling their wisdom and efforts, and moving forward in unison. As the saying goes, "The plan for the year is in spring; the plan for the day is in the morning." Now, at the beginning of the year, I would like to share the message of "doubling efforts according to these three points" with the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>China in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Beginning</p>
<p>The year of the Republic of China, year 25, has passed amidst turbulent waves. Looking back at the events that transpired during this year, one is truly dazzled. This article aims to select the most prominent events and provide an objective narrative, serving as a reference for our countrymen to look back and forward at this turn of the year.</p>
<p>During this past year, the most noteworthy aspect was undoubtedly the Sino-Japanese diplomacy and the situation in North China. Closely related to the evolution of the North China situation was the war in Suiyuan. To review China's past year, we must naturally focus on the developments of these two major events. However, our gaze should not be too narrow; we should also understand other significant domestic developments. Major events include political and economic reforms, developments in construction, the Liangguang Incident, and the Xi'an Incident that occurred at the end of last year. These events are inextricably linked to Sino-Japanese diplomacy, the situation in North China, and the Suiyuan War. For the sake of convenience, this article can only provide a brief overview. It is hoped that readers will grasp the changes of the past year holistically and comprehensively, discerning the rise and fall of various issues through their interconnectedness.</p>
<p>㊀ Sino-Japanese Diplomacy and the North China Situation</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese diplomacy over the past year can be roughly divided into two periods, with the return of the former Japanese Ambassador to China, Ariyoshi, to Japan and his appointment as Foreign Minister serving as the dividing line. This is not to say that Ariyoshi's appointment as Foreign Minister brought about a fundamental change in Japan's policy towards China. However, it is a clear fact that after Ariyoshi assumed the position of Foreign Minister, both China and Japan showed a tendency to strive for a comprehensive adjustment of their bilateral relations.</p>
<p>Japan's diplomatic policy towards China has consistently been based on the Hirota Three Principles. These principles are: ㊀ China should abandon its anti-Japanese stance and genuinely strive for East Asian peace, in which case Japan is prepared to assist China in seeking stability in East Asia; ㊁ Improve the Sino-Japanese-"Manchukuo" relationship, focusing on North China; ㊂ Prevent the spread of communism, which poses a major obstacle to East Asian peace. Hirota's speech at the opening of the Japanese Diet on January 21st of last year, the report of the outgoing Japanese Ambassador to China, Ariyoshi Akira, upon his return to Japan on February 12th, and Ariyoshi's diplomatic policies announced upon assuming his position as Ambassador to China, all consistently emphasized the implementation of the so-called Three Principles. Even after Ariyoshi's appointment as Foreign Minister, according to a report released by the China United News Agency on April 14th of last year, Ariyoshi advocated for focusing diplomatic efforts on "expanding the Hebei-Chahar political power as preparation for establishing a 'North China State'," "economically inducing China to recognize the puppet 'Manchukuo' and forming a so-called integrated Sino-Japanese-'Manchukuo' economic relationship," and "achieving the above goals under the guise of joint anti-communism." These were essentially variations of the Hirota Three Principles.</p>
<p>During Ariyoshi's brief tenure as Ambassador to China from late February to late March of last year, Sino-Japanese relations were significantly more active than before. In mid-March, Ariyoshi and our Foreign Minister Zhang Qun held four diplomatic talks. The content of the talks, as stated in the joint announcement issued by both sides after the four rounds of talks, was that "all issues related to the two countries were discussed." The result was that "although the views of both sides were not entirely consistent, it can be considered beneficial to the mutual understanding." From this, it can be seen that although these talks did not reach a definitive conclusion, they can be regarded as preparation for future negotiations on a comprehensive adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>After Ariyoshi's return to Japan, Sino-Japanese relations became quite dim due to the emergence of instability in parts of North China, and only slightly improved around July. In his diplomatic report at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, our Foreign Minister Zhang Qun sincerely proposed that China and Japan should seek a comprehensive adjustment of their relationship through diplomatic channels, marking the beginning of this effort. Subsequently, on July 17th, Japanese Foreign Minister Ariyoshi also expressed his agreement that China and Japan should make fundamental adjustments. As such, Sino-Japanese relations temporarily showed signs of revitalization. Following these expressions, in late August, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe, convened a high-level meeting of officials from the foreign, army, and navy ministries in Tianjin, resulting in a concrete outcome to prepare for comprehensive negotiations between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Amidst the calls for a fundamental adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, incidents involving harm to Japanese residents occurred in Chengdu, Beihai, Shantou, Hankou, Shanghai, and other places, exacerbating the disputes between the two sides, leading to a tense situation. On September 13th, Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe traveled from Shanghai to Beijing and began direct negotiations with our Foreign Minister Zhang Qun on all issues between China and Japan. From September 15th to 23rd, Kawagoe met with Foreign Minister Zhang three times, but due to the vast differences in their views, there were no results. Suddenly, the Shanghai Hongkou incident, in which Japanese soldiers were killed, broke out. The atmosphere on the Japanese side took an openly confrontational turn. The negotiations were thus stalled. After the three ministries discussed ways to break the deadlock, the Japanese side dispatched Kuwajima, the Director of the East Asia Bureau and the drafter of the Hirota Three Principles, carrying Japan's final proposal to China, instructing Kawagoe to negotiate. According to reports, Japan did not want to immediately resolve all pending issues, but only wanted to quickly resolve the important issues most relevant to Japan's interests. After this, the situation eased. The Sino-Japanese negotiations, which had been stalled for some time, resumed on October 19th. In the fifth, sixth, and seventh meetings between Foreign Minister Zhang and Kawagoe, the discussions focused on the special status of North China and joint anti-communism. Although there were no definitive results, there was at least the possibility of seeking a reasonable solution through normal diplomatic channels. Unfortunately, in the Suiyuan area, puppet bandits and other mixed troops, instigated by others, attacked our side. Under such circumstances, diplomatic negotiations were difficult to proceed smoothly. On December 5th, the Zhang-Kawagoe talks finally could not continue. Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe left Beijing for Shanghai, leaving only the Japanese Consul-General Suma to negotiate with Gao Zongwu, the Director of the Asian Affairs Department of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a side channel. Eight days after the Xi'an Incident (December 20th), Kawagoe, who had been staying in Shanghai, once again traveled to Beijing, presumably with the intention of "acting according to circumstances."</p>
<p>As for the development of the North China situation, it can be roughly divided into three periods: the first period focused on negotiations on the Hebei-East and Chahar-North issues; the second period focused on the smuggling issue and the "joint anti-communism" issue; and the third period focused on the "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation" issue.</p>
<p>The North China situation was at its most critical when Yin Rugeng announced "autonomy" in November of the 24th year of the Republic of China and organized the so-called "Hebei-East 22 Counties Autonomous Committee." The establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council on December 8th provided some relief to the pressing crisis in North China. Just as the 32nd Army of our Shang Zhen was withdrawing, the Zhao Lei troops of the "Hebei-East Autonomous Committee" seized Tanggu and Dagu; at the same time, the Li Shouxin troops of the puppet "Manchukuo" army and the Mongolian security forces also occupied Guyuan, Shangdu, Kangbao, Zhangbei, Baochang, Wanquan, and other six counties in Chahar-North. As long as the puppet organization in Hebei-East existed, North China would not be at peace for a single day; as long as the six counties in Chahar-North were occupied, Suiyuan Province would be under threat for a single day. Moreover, the Japanese side's goals were definitely not limited to this. They originally intended to establish a puppet regime of the so-called "North China Five Provinces Autonomy" in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan. Instigating Yin Rugeng to establish the so-called puppet autonomous government of Hebei-East was the basis of this attempt. The Hebei-Chahar authorities were well aware of this crisis. Therefore, after Song Zheyuan took office as the Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, he negotiated with the Japanese side to resolve these two issues. However, due to the Japanese side's ambiguous attitude, with the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, Tada, sometimes coming forward to negotiate, and the chief of the Kwantung Army's special service agency, Doihara, being responsible for mediation at other times, one side would agree while the other would not acknowledge it, and vice versa, ultimately leading to no results.</p>
<p>Another serious situation in North China was the rampant smuggling. In January, February, and March of last year, the total value of smuggled goods entering the country was at least 100 million yuan. Combined with the 210 million yuan of smuggled goods from the previous year, the total value was 310 million yuan, accounting for more than 30% of our country's total import value, which is truly a staggering figure. Later, the trend of smuggling spread from North China to Central and South China, shaking the already weak foundation of China's entire national industry. In order to remedy this terrible economic hemorrhage, our government successively promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Tax Evasion and Smuggling," the "Detailed Rules for Preventing Smuggling on Railways," and the "Measures for Inspecting the Transportation and Sales of Imported Goods" in late May. However, because a certain party supported this smuggling trend in various ways, even if the government repeatedly promulgated measures to ban it, it was still impossible to implement them.</p>
<p>Anti-communism was one of the so-called Hirota Three Principles. Therefore, since the communist army infiltrated Shanxi, the Japanese side has made various unreasonable demands under this pretext. In fact, anti-communism is purely a matter of internal affairs of a country, and the Hebei-Chahar authorities had already taken comprehensive precautions. However, the Japanese side still insisted on raising the demand for "joint anti-communism." In May, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, Nagami, repeatedly proposed the suggestion of "joint anti-communism" to the Hebei-Chahar authorities, and believed that it was necessary to decide on specific measures immediately. The two sides negotiated on this issue for a long time, and it was rumored that an anti-communist agreement had been signed. In fact, although the Japanese side strongly urged it, they still did not get their wish.</p>
<p>In the third period, developing the economy of North China became the central task of the Japanese side. Sino-Japanese economic cooperation had been rumored for a long time. Initially, the Japanese side did not seem to have a concrete plan to propose. It was not until October, when the commander of the Japanese garrison in North China, Tashiro, met with Song Zheyuan, that the military's pre-drafted plan was revealed. According to the scope of economic development stipulated by the military, it can be roughly divided into six sectors: first, railways; second, ports; third, electricity; fourth, Lu salt; fifth, mines; and sixth, cotton production. According to this plan, the construction of the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang railway and the Jinan-Liaocheng railway, the dredging of rivers and seas, the opening of ports in Dagu and Qikou, the development of the North China electricity industry, cotton production improvement, the establishment of the North China Salt Industry Company, and the mining of the Longyan iron mine, etc., were all included. The Zhongxing Company, which was in charge of the economic development of North China, once considered increasing its capital from 10 million yuan to 100 million yuan. Although it did not materialize due to the wait-and-see attitude of domestic capitalists in Japan, its ambition can be clearly seen from this. By the end of last year, the first step in Sino-Japanese North China economic cooperation that had been realized was the establishment of the Huitong Company to handle Sino-Japanese navigation affairs in North China. The Huitong Company opened in Tianjin on November 17th of last year, and navigation on various lines has already begun. The construction of the Cangzhou-Shijiazhuang railway and the opening of the Longyan iron mine are under consideration, and sooner or later they will probably be realized.</p>
<p>The banner of economic cooperation is cooperation and mutual assistance. Without mentioning anything else, just the Fengtai Incident in September of last year and the North China military exercises of the Japanese army in late October reveal the hideous face that is the opposite of cooperation and mutual assistance. The Fengtai Incident began with the Japanese army's unreasonable detention of Sun Xiangting, the company commander of our 29th Army, but ended with the coercion of our side to accept unbelievable conditions such as the withdrawal of troops from Fengtai. The Japanese army's exercises in North China lasted for ten days, from October 26th to November 5th, with more than 7,000 participants. The roar of cannons on our territory should prompt those friendly people who advocate friendship to deeply reflect!</p>
<p>㊁ Political, Economic, and Construction Reforms</p>
<p>In the past year, our country has clearly made rapid progress in politics, economy, and construction. A brief description is provided below:</p>
<p>(A) Promulgation of the National Assembly Organization Law, Representative Election Law, and Draft Constitution. The National Assembly was resolved to be convened on November 12th of last year by the Second Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. The National Assembly representatives were limited to those elected before Double Tenth Day (October 10th). The organization law and representative election law of the National Assembly were authorized to the Constitution Drafting Committee to formulate principles and submit draft laws to the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan completed the drafting of the laws in early May, and they were promulgated by the National Government on May 15th. Since the promulgation of the election law, etc., the election of representatives has been carried out in various provinces. On October 15th, at the 23rd Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Committee, in view of the fact that the election could not be completed on schedule, it was resolved to postpone the National Assembly until the representatives from all regions were elected. As for the draft constitution, drafting began in January of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and the draft was completed in early September. In October of the 24th year of the Republic of China, it was reviewed and completed by the Central Standing Committee. The final draft, as deliberated by the Legislative Yuan, was passed on May 1st of last year after three readings in the Yuan meeting and was promulgated by the National Government on May 5th. The full text of the constitution is divided into eight chapters, totaling one hundred and forty-eight articles.</p>
<p>(B) The Second Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee of the Kuomintang convened. The Second Plenary Session opened on July 10th and closed on July 14th, with one preparatory meeting and three plenary sessions in between. The presidium consisted of nine people: Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Ke, Feng Yuxiang, Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Ju Zheng, Chen Guofu, Wang Faqin, and Kong Xiangxi. Ye Chucang served as the Secretary-General of the session. Many resolutions were made at this meeting, the most important of which were two proposals concerning national defense and the resolution of the Liangguang issue. Regarding national defense, the session passed a resolution to establish a National Defense Conference, designating Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Chen Jitang as members. Regarding the resolution of the Liangguang Incident, one was to pass an order to abolish the Southwest Executive Committee, and the other was to reassign Yu Hanmou as the Pacification Director of Guangdong, and Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi as the Director and Deputy Director of the Pacification Headquarters of Guangxi, and to appoint Lin Yunhai and Huang Xuchu as the chairmen of the Guangdong and Guangxi provincial governments.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding economic matters, the two most notable events of the past year were: first, the issuance of the Unified and Reconstruction Public Bonds; and second, the passage of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations. The Ministry of Finance announced the issuance of the Unified and Reconstruction Public Bonds on February 1st. The purpose of issuing the Unified Public Bonds was to exchange the old bonds issued by the government in the past. The total amount was 146 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and a repayment period divided into five types: 12 years, 15 years, 18 years, 21 years, and 24 years. Principal and interest were repaid every six months through a lottery. The funds for principal and interest repayment were still allocated from customs duties. The Reconstruction Public Bonds were used to improve the financial structure, support production and construction, and allocate funds to stabilize the bond market. The total amount was 34 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and repayment within 24 years. The methods and fund allocation for principal and interest repayment were the same as those for the Unified Public Bonds. The drafting of the income tax bill began in June of last year and was passed by the Legislative Yuan on July 9th at its 68th Yuan meeting, called the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, with a total of six chapters and twenty-two articles. According to these regulations, the scope of taxation included income from capital profits and temporary profits, income from salaries, and income from interest on securities and deposits. The tax rate ranged from 5 per thousand to 200 per thousand.</p>
<p>(D) In the past year, the most significant progress in construction was the development of transportation. Highways in various provinces were being built rapidly. Taking the liaison highways in various provinces supervised by the National Economic Council as an example, according to the figures released in November of last year, the total length of trunk and branch lines was 29,876 kilometers, of which 22,923 kilometers were open to traffic by the end of September. Regarding railway construction, the most important event last year was the opening of the Yuehan Railway on September 1st. This railway starts from Wuchang in Hubei Province in the north, passes through Hunan, and reaches Guangzhou. The total length of the line is 1,960 kilometers. Connecting to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway in the south and the Pinghan Railway in the north, the Yuehan Railway is the largest railway running through China. In addition, the construction plans for the Xiangqian Railway (from Changsha in Hunan to Guiyang in Guizhou) and the Chengyu Railway (from Chengdu to Chongqing) have also been concretized.</p>
<p>㊂ The Liangguang Incident</p>
<p>At this critical time of national crisis, we should concentrate internal forces to resist the enemy together, and should never waste national strength due to internal problems. This is the creed that the people of the country should abide by together. The peaceful resolution of the Liangguang Incident last year, without either side resorting to military force,</p>

<h3>China's Foreign Trade and Industry in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Sun Huairen</p>
<p>Observing China's economy in 1936 (the 25th year of the Republic) solely from the surface, one could naturally say it was "slightly better than expected" compared to 1935. In foreign trade, there was a month with a trade surplus; in agriculture, there was a major harvest; in prices, there was a tendency towards rising; and in foreign exchange, there was a relatively stable situation. Of course, we do not deny that these phenomena are optimistic signs. However, to conclude that China's economy had already recovered to prosperity based solely on these materials would be somewhat "illogical." At best, we can only say that the panic in China's economy in 1936 did not drastically worsen. However, many economic crises still lingered, not yet extinguished. This is because China is not an isolated island in the world economy. Especially for a country like China, which is in a "semi-colonial" position, it is impossible in reality to break free from the constraints of the great powers and independently escape the global panic to achieve prosperity. Moreover, China's economy itself, since the outbreak of the great panic in 1931 (the 20th year of the Republic), has been exhausted for six years. It is also impossible in reality to completely restore it with a slight improvement. Therefore, the greatest effect of some changes in China's economy in 1936 was only to strengthen the resistance to the panic, but not to fundamentally eliminate the panic.</p>
<p>The slight improvement in the economic situation in the past year cannot be denied as being stimulated by the currency reform in November 1935. At the time of the currency reform, we pointed out its characteristics, believing that it might be possible to use it to temporarily stimulate the numb Chinese economy. However, to use it to drive away the panic in the Chinese economy, the currency system itself simply does not have this capability. This is just like a person with numerous ailments; even if one part of the disease is cured, it is impossible to fully restore health. Therefore, the failure of currency reform to restore prosperity is by no means the fault of the currency system itself. In fact, the relatively satisfactory performance of China's economy last year can be said to be the maximum effect that currency reform has had. We cannot expect any more than that. Now, let's take a look at the situation of foreign trade and industry in 1936 to confirm that this theory is not wrong.</p>
<p>From January to September of last year, total imports were 680 million yuan, a decrease of 40 million yuan compared to the same period last year; exports were 510 million yuan, an increase of over 110 million yuan. As a result, the import surplus decreased by 147 million yuan, and January was even a month with a trade surplus. This phenomenon is, of course, a favorable development for China's international lending. And this favorable development is, of course, partly due to currency reform. But apart from this, there are two other reasons that cannot be ignored in terms of imports. The first is the sudden decrease in the import of foreign grain (rice has dropped from the first position in imports to the eighth, and wheat has dropped from the sixth to the thirteenth). The reason for this reduction in foreign grain is because of the poor overseas production last year and China's imposition of rice import tariffs. The second is due to rampant smuggling, with many imports not recorded in customs registers. If these two reasons did not exist, then the value of imports last year might not have decreased so much. As for the increase in exports, the factor of the global demand for military supplies cannot be ignored. We know that the top ten export goods last year were tung oil, raw hides and leather goods, egg products, raw silk, tea, bristles, drawn work, tin ingots, cotton, and sesame. Among these ten, products with less military significance, such as egg products, raw silk, and tea, did not actually increase much in exports, and their positions have even declined compared to last year. Therefore, the improvement in China's international trade last year may initially be attributed to the stimulation of the new currency system, but without the assistance of other factors, the import surplus might not have been reduced so much. The reduction of the apparent import surplus due to smuggling cannot be said to be beneficial to China. However, the real decrease in import value and the real increase in export value are undeniably good phenomena. However, in China's trade last year, although the authorities promulgated many regulations to prevent smuggling, the trend of smuggling has not been curbed. Recently, in North China, automobiles are openly used for transportation, and the inspection offices have no solution. As for the real decrease in imports and the real increase in exports, signs of unsustainability have emerged after the third quarter. The following table shows the monthly average of imports and exports: (unit: million yuan)</p>
<p>This figure tells us several facts: ㊀ The monthly average of imports increased faster than the monthly average of exports; ㊁ The monthly average of imports in the third quarter was already larger than the same period last year; ㊂ The monthly average of exports in the third quarter was already less than the same period last year. This fact indicates that although China's trade last year was generally improved, the tendency for improvement was difficult to sustain by the third quarter, and even returned to the same level as the same period last year. Although this half-year improvement in trade is temporary for China's extremely adverse trade situation in recent years, it is ultimately very valuable. However, it is inevitable to encounter the "sorrow of disillusionment" if we are optimistic about the future of trade because of this.</p>
<p>Next, let's look back at the situation of domestic industry and commerce. The prosperity or decline of industry and commerce can be observed from the changes in commodity market prices on the one hand, and from the changes in industrial and commercial organizations on the other. Here, let's first list some important market prices: (unit: yuan, according to the Bank of China Monthly)</p>
<p>Looking at these commodity market prices, we can undoubtedly see that last year's market prices were much more active than the previous year (except for rice and raw silk). The rise in commodity market prices is naturally a sign of prosperity for producers and for the Chinese economy. However, if we observe more deeply, we find that last year's rise in market prices contained some defects. The first point we can point out is that the price increase was not sustained. Among the commodities mentioned above, except for cotton yarn, rice, wheat, and flour, the prices of various commodities have shown a tendency to decline successively. Originally, last year, after the currency value decreased, even if the prices were intentionally prevented from rising, they would not have fallen month by month. Therefore, the lack of sustainability in this price increase is probably due to the lack of real demand. The second point we can point out is the disharmony in the price increases of agricultural products and industrial products. Among the ten commodities mentioned above, the ones whose prices increased less than the previous year or even fell were raw silk, cotton, green tea, black tea, and rice. The degree of increase in the other five was much greater than the former five. And these commodities that increased rapidly, except for wheat, are all industrial products. This situation cannot be said to be a healthy phenomenon in the Chinese economy, because the gap between the prices of agricultural products and industrial products relatively shrinks the purchasing power and market in China, where the agricultural population accounts for the majority. Among the above two defects, the latter is naturally more serious. Last year, it happened to coincide with an unprecedented bumper harvest. At the same time, disasters were not very common, so this defect has not caused any significant adverse consequences. If this year's natural environment cannot be as good as last year, and there cannot be a more expanded issue of currency, then it will be quite difficult to keep prices stable without falling.</p>
<p>Regarding the changes in industrial and commercial organizations, although there are no nationwide systematic materials yet, only taking Shanghai as an example, then it can only be said that the situation is slightly better than the previous year, but it cannot be said to have reached prosperity. According to a survey by the China Credit Information Service, the changes in Shanghai's industry and commerce in the third quarter of last year are as follows:</p>
<p>Judging from this statistical figure, the number of new industrial and commercial establishments in the third quarter of last year has been increasing month by month, and conversely, the number of closures has been gradually decreasing. This seems to symbolize that industry and commerce have been trending towards prosperity last year, but in fact, if we examine its content, we can find many facts that are not entirely true.</p>
<p>From this analysis of the content, we can obtain several accurate concepts: The first point that should be noted is that the most new establishments this year are special industries. In the first quarter, health and entertainment industries were the most prominent; in the second quarter, hotels and restaurants were the most prominent; and by the last month of the third quarter, it had changed to "escort agencies," a disguised form of prostitution. As for important special industries such as the financial industry and the construction industry, there has been almost no development; The second point to note is that there has been no significant development in the manufacturing industry. In the first quarter, six new establishments were created, but forty closed down. In the second quarter, twelve new establishments were created, but thirty-six closed down. In September of the third quarter, seven new establishments were created, but ten closed down; The third point to note is that the trend of reorganization, contraction, and closure in sales businesses is particularly large, and has far exceeded new developments; The fourth point to note is that the data collected in this statistic do not distinguish between large and small, and it is somewhat dangerous to judge solely based on the number of establishments rather than the scale. Combining these points, we can boldly conclude that the development of industry and commerce last year has not yet had genuine soundness. Moreover, generally speaking, if we regard new establishments and expansions as good phenomena, and contractions, reorganizations, and closures as bad phenomena, then the ratio of the former to the latter last year is approximately one to six.</p>
<p>From the inferences based on the foreign trade and Shanghai industry and commerce situations above (in fact, other situations are also largely the same), it is very sufficient to prove what we said earlier, that is, China's economy last year can generally be said to be slightly "better than expected." But this "better than expected" can, at most, only strengthen China's resistance to the panic, and it is fundamentally not yet talking about prosperity. And to truly make China prosperous, I am afraid it will take several economic reforms beyond currency reform.</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>Meeting each other amidst conflicts is indeed a matter worth celebrating.</p>
<p>The sharp confrontation between Guangdong-Guangxi and the central government arose from differing opinions on resisting the enemy. The Guangdong-Guangxi side advocated immediate resistance and repeatedly sent telegrams in early June requesting the central government to lead troops. After this banner was raised, Guangdong-Guangxi mobilized troops to move north. The Cantonese army advanced north along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and the Guangxi army advanced north from Lingling, reaching the south of Hengyang in Hunan Province. At the same time, the central government also mobilized heavy troops in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces for defense, creating a situation that seemed ready to erupt. Fortunately, the central government consistently adopted a political approach to resolve the situation, and the southwestern authorities were also unwilling to sacrifice their strength in internal conflicts, so a civil war was avoided. This incident took a major turn after Li Han-hun, deputy commander of the 2nd Army under Chen Jitang, and Yu Hanmou, commander of the 1st Army, telegraphed their support for the central government. On July 13, the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved to remove Chen Jitang from all his posts, with Yu Hanmou succeeding him as Pacification Commissioner. After Chen was forced to leave Guangdong, the Guangdong part was declared resolved. The Guangxi part of the problem could have been resolved at the same time, but the central government's announcement of the replacement of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi as the Guangxi Pacification Commissioners with appointments as Standing Committee members of the Military Affairs Commission and Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government caused complications. On July 28, Li and Bai convened a military conference in Nanning, and their attitude suddenly became tough. In early August, there were even rumors of organizing an independent government. After a prolonged stalemate, Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan of the National Government, Cheng Qian, Chief of Staff, and Zhu Peide, Director of the Office of the Military Affairs Commission, were appointed as mediators and flew to Nanning on September 2 to discuss a peaceful resolution with Li and Bai. After several consultations, the extremely depressed situation was finally broken on September 6, and the decided solution was to retain Li Zongren as the Guangxi Pacification Commissioner, while Bai Chongxi was transferred to the Military Affairs Commission as a Standing Committee member. A great disturbance was peacefully resolved, truly a great fortune amidst misfortune.</p>
<p>㊃ The Suiyuan War</p>
<p>We only need to briefly look at the circumstances surrounding the Suiyuan War to understand that this Suiyuan War was not a local affair, nor was it an accidental occurrence. It was merely part of a certain party's plan to annex North China and an inevitable stage in its development.</p>
<p>The bandit-puppet forces' invasion of Suiyuan had already been tested on a small scale in July and August of last year. Although they were repelled at that time, because the ambition of the commander behind them had not been extinguished, the tense situation did not lessen. Sure enough, there were constant harassing actions in early November, and on the 11th, mixed troops of bandit-puppets from Shangdu, under the command of Li Shou-hsin, attacked the Taolin area in eastern Suiyuan. The bandit-puppet forces' invasion plan was roughly divided into two routes: northern Suiyuan and eastern Suiyuan. The northern Suiyuan route used Bailingmiao as a base, either heading down to Wuchuan and taking Guisui, or heading down to Guyang and occupying Baotou; the eastern Suiyuan route wanted to take Jining directly from Shangdu, cutting off the connection between Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Hebei provinces. From the end of November to the beginning of December, the bandit-puppets attacked according to this plan. In the process of the war, the equipment and commanders of the bandit-puppet forces were supplied by a certain party, and the Kwantung Army Headquarters even had plans to send regular troops to assist. The planners of the certain party originally expected to take Guisui and Baotou in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, on the evening of November 23, our army fought bravely and occupied Bailingmiao on the morning of the 24th. On December 10, it recovered Damiao, which is 160 li west of Bailingmiao. This was a major turning point in the Suiyuan War. First, these two victories proved the fallacy of the defeatist mentality of some people; second, Bailingmiao and Damiao were important military bases for the bandit-puppet forces in northern Suiyuan. After being captured, the crisis of coercion by the bandit-puppet forces in northern Suiyuan was eliminated. At first, the Suiyuan War had more of a defensive meaning on our side, but after the recovery of Bailingmiao and Damiao, the situation changed. If we were to launch an active war of resistance, this should be regarded as a very favorable starting point.</p>
<p>Since the Suiyuan War broke out, we have seen an extremely gratifying phenomenon, that is, the nationwide enthusiasm for supporting Suiyuan. Those with financial resources enthusiastically donated, which was expected. Those without financial resources even went on hunger strikes to donate money to the soldiers at the front. Such a soaring national consciousness and national sentiment are signs of the success of the Chinese nation's liberation movement!</p>
<p>㊄ The Xi'an Incident</p>
<p>By December of last year, everyone saw that there were no major waves in either domestic or foreign affairs, and thought that they could pass the rest of the year peacefully. Who would have thought that the Xi'an Incident would be the concluding article of this year's short history?</p>
<p>It is said that the incident had been brewing for a long time. A year ago, the so-called young Northeastern faction in Zhang Xueliang's staff, such as Miao Jinran and Ying De-yi, had gradually gained power. Many young officers under Zhang's subordinates Wang Yizhe and He Zhuguo followed them. They had planned to launch the incident two months ago, and the telegram had already been drafted, but it was stopped by Mo Dehui's strong persuasion. By the end of November, the internal situation became more urgent. Zhang Xueliang flew to Luoyang on December 3 to meet with Chairman Chiang. Chiang thought that after a clear explanation, he would be relieved, and decided to personally give a speech to the troops stationed in Xi'an on the morning of the 12th. Unexpectedly, he was taken advantage of. On the morning of the 12th, Zhang's subordinates rebelled and kidnapped Chiang. At the same time, the central military and political officials who were detained included Chiang Ting-wen, Zhu Shaoliang, Chen Cheng, Chen Jicheng, Wei Lihuang, Wan Yaohuang, Chen Diaoyuan, Ma Zhanshan, Zeng Kuangqing, Shao Lizi, Qian Dajun, Zhang Chong, and Jiang Fangzhen, a total of 13 people. Those who died in the line of duty were Shao Yuanchong, Chiang Xiaoxian, Xiao Naihua, and Yang Zhenya.</p>
<p>From the occurrence of the incident to the time the reporter finished writing this article, the resolution of this incident has undergone several twists and turns. On the 12th, the National Government ordered Zhang Xueliang to be dismissed and severely punished, which shows the government's basic view on handling this incident. On the 14th, Australian Donald, who had served as Zhang Xueliang's advisor, flew to Xi'an to meet with Zhang Xueliang to give Zhang Xueliang and others a chance to repent and turn around. This was the first turning point. After Donald returned, there did not seem to be much progress or turning point, so on the 16th, the National Government issued an order to suppress the rebellion, appointing He Yingqin as the commander-in-chief of the suppression. On the 17th, Liu Zhi was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route Army of the suppression, and Gu Zhutong was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Western Route Army of the suppression. This was the second turning point. On the 17th, Chiang Dingwen, who had originally been kidnapped together, flew from Xi'an to Nanjing, carrying Chairman Chiang's handwritten letter, instructing Commander-in-Chief He to temporarily stop bombing. This was the third turning point. On the 20th, Soong Tzu-wen flew to Xi'an to meet with Chairman Chiang and Zhang Xueliang. On the 21st, he returned to Nanjing. On the 22nd, he flew to Xi'an again with Madam Chiang. On the afternoon of the 25th, Chairman Chiang escaped danger and flew from Xi'an to Luoyang. A great disturbance was peacefully resolved, which is worth celebrating.</p>
<h3>The International Situation of the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Ji Nan</p>
<p>In recent years, commentators have generally regarded 1936 as the year of the most serious international crisis and the possible outbreak of World War II, fearing that the world's tragic changes may not be avoided and that the catastrophe of mankind will be seen again. However, in fact, 1936 has passed in anxiety and shock. During the year, the international situation changed in many ways, with the two major forces of peace and aggression rising and falling. Although some parts of the world are inevitably disturbed, on the whole, the so-called outbreak of World War II has not yet been seen in fact. If we try to analyze the internal nature of the important international developments of the past year and observe their interrelationships, there should be traces to be found.</p>
<p>In late February, the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact signed in May of last year was passed by the French Chamber of Deputies and formally ratified. The pact stipulates: "If France and Russia are attacked without provocation, the two countries agree to immediately assist each other;" "If non-League of Nations member states engage in aggression and target France and Russia as their targets of aggression, France and Russia also agree to immediately assist each other." Its significance is actually aimed at Germany. Soon after, on March 7, Hitler unilaterally declared the abolition of the Locarno Treaty and the stationing of troops in the Rhineland. The system of collective security in Western Europe for more than ten years was completely destroyed, shocking the world, and the situation suddenly became tense. The excuse for abolishing the treaty was that the Franco-Soviet pact violated the spirit of Locarno and posed a major threat to Germany. In fact, Hitler's attempt to get rid of the constraints of post-war treaties has always been his consistent policy. Since the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian War, Germany has been watching the situation, seizing opportunities to restore its pre-war status. With Britain and Italy at odds over sanctions, the Stresa Front was on the verge of collapse, and joint resistance to Germany was impossible. At the same time, the League of Nations was overwhelmed by the failure of sanctions against Italy and had no energy to punish Germany's breach of treaties, so there was no need to worry too much about the danger of being sanctioned by the League of Nations. This is why Hitler dared to take such extraordinary measures, defying the world. We can see that after the German troops entered the Rhineland, although France's attitude was extremely firm, advocating strict sanctions, demanding military assistance from the Locarno signatories, applying to the League of Nations to take severe measures, and convening representatives of the signatory countries to form a four-nation agreement, with the determination not to negotiate without withdrawing troops, it ultimately gave in to Britain's ambiguous attitude and the gradually approaching of Germany and Italy, daring not to rashly start a war, and watching the treaty guaranteeing the security of the French and Belgian borders being torn up by Hitler without being able to do anything. It can be seen that the contradictions among the Western European countries are deep, and it is not easy to coordinate to jointly contain the expansion of aggressive forces and maintain the survival of collective security.</p>
<p>Regarding the Italian-Abyssinian War, since its outbreak in May of last year, due to the deep conflict of interests between Britain and Italy, knowledgeable people have long regarded it as an important factor in the outbreak of a major war. Britain believed that Italy's expansion of power in East Africa could directly shake its hegemony in the Mediterranean and indirectly affect the survival of the British Empire, so it consistently put pressure on Italy and spared no effort to support the implementation of League of Nations sanctions against Italy. However, in order to take care of the anti-German front, France did not want to seriously hurt Italy's feelings, and although it supported sanctions, it failed to take the same steps as Britain. Therefore, the League of Nations' sanctions measures could not be thorough, progress was difficult, and there was little practical effect. After the failure of the Hoare-Laval Pact in December of last year, the hope of compromise was dashed, and Britain further tightened sanctions, proposing an oil embargo. However, France was deeply afraid of expanding the scope of the war and always held back, resulting in hesitation and missed opportunities. After Hitler took the opportunity to unilaterally declare the abolition of the Locarno Treaty and the stationing of troops in the Rhineland, the European countries had to shift their attention to the tense situation on the banks of the Rhine River. France, facing this extraordinary change, was panicking and at a loss in dealing with the difficulties, and had no energy to spare to take care of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, which was not directly related. Therefore, Mussolini was able to calmly use force in East Africa, capturing Addis Ababa in early May and adding the title of Emperor of Abyssinia to the Italian King. From then on, the Mediterranean was shared by Britain and Italy. Britain, due to the threat of Italy's powerful air force to its naval base on the island of Malta, lost its value in controlling the Mediterranean, and its sea routes were likely to be cut off by Italy at any time. Its centuries-old hegemony in the Mediterranean had also begun to shake. However, although Britain felt deeply hurt, it was limited by reality, and the situation did not allow for war. It had to compromise, reluctantly concede, and lift sanctions in order to ease the situation for the time being. However, the competition between the two countries in the Mediterranean, both overt and covert, is in full swing, and we cannot conclude that the dispute has been reasonably resolved based on temporary easing. Recently, Rome has also strongly advocated the idea of an Anglo-Italian gentleman's agreement, arguing that the two countries should establish a sincere, rapid, and thorough understanding based on the recognition of mutual interests in order to break the deadlock. However, since Italy regards the Mediterranean as equal to life, and Britain regards the freedom of traffic in the Mediterranean as the key to the survival of the empire, the two sides may temporarily compromise, but whether the crisis of conflict can really be eliminated seems to depend on the evolution of the situation.</p>
<p>In mid-July, a right-wing armed rebellion occurred in Spain, attempting to overthrow the government and establish a dictatorship. The world paid attention to it as another major change in Europe after the end of the Italian-Abyssinian War. The rebels had actually reached a tacit understanding with Germany and Italy in advance, while the government forces had the sympathy of France and Russia. The seriousness of its significance is not only the conflict between the left and right factions in Spain. Britain and France, deeply fearing that this would trigger a major war crisis, advocated a non-intervention agreement with Spain, urging Germany, Italy, Portugal, Russia, and other countries to join in succession to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. However, in fact, the assistance of Germany, Italy, and Portugal to the rebels has never stopped, allowing the rebels to win victories and capture famous cities one after another. By mid-October, the capital city of Madrid was besieged, and the war reached its most serious stage. Then, the Soviet Union, believing that the violation of the agreement by Germany, Italy, and Portugal had forced it to no longer be able to ignore it, announced to the Adjustment Committee of the Non-Intervention Agreement that it would reserve freedom of action. Therefore, for the past two months, the artillery fire in Madrid has been no less than a decisive battle between the Soviet Union and Germany and Italy. If the Adjustment Committee cannot quickly take effective measures, then in case of careless action, it will further develop into an open conflict, which will inevitably lead to a situation that European politicians are unwilling to deal with, and the consequences, how can it be imagined? Recently, Britain and France have also made a mediation proposal, advocating a truce between the two sides, and a referendum by citizens to determine the suitability of the political system. If this move can proceed smoothly, it can temporarily ease the crisis. However, it is difficult to predict whether Germany, Italy, and Portugal will not go too far. Judging from the current situation, the three countries do not seem to have the sincerity to accept the proposal, and the hope of compromise is extremely bleak. The future of the Spanish turmoil is really worrying.</p>
<p>Austria is located between Germany and Italy. Germany has long wanted to annex it to realize its Third Reich, but it has been restricted by the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Saint-Germain, as well as the intervention of the Little Entente and Britain and France. In particular, Italy has the most intense conflict with Germany due to the security of the Brenner Pass and the development of economic plans in the Danube River basin, and it strongly opposes it. It is recalled that in July 1934, when the Austrian Social Democratic Party, instigated by Hitler, launched a riot to seize power and Dollfuss was tragically killed, Italy immediately deployed troops to the border, determined to intervene by force. The situation was tense and peaceful in Central Europe was in danger. Commentators say that Austria is the powder keg of Central Europe, which is not an exaggeration. In the past three years, the Austrian issue has been the focus of contention between Germany and Italy. As long as the issue exists, the diplomatic relations between the two countries will not be easy to compromise. However, how long has it been? The shift in the international situation has made the use of diplomatic means unpredictable. Hitler took advantage of the League of Nations being busy dealing with the East African dispute and having no time to take care of other matters, and suddenly stationed troops in the Rhineland, and Italy's oil embargo was thus resolved. This kind of mutual use of facts opened the door to German-Italian cooperation. The two countries knew that it was urgent to remove the obstacles to compromise and quickly reach an understanding to resist the pressure of Britain and France. Therefore, Germany and Austria actually concluded an agreement on July 10 under the mediation of Mussolini. The Central European dispute came to an end. From then on, the two major Fascist forces of Germany and Italy began to join hands, the Stresa Front no longer existed, and Germany was able to emerge from the encirclement led by France, devoting all its efforts to developing towards Eastern Europe, forming a large group of countries such as Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Austria, confronting France and Russia. Europe was clearly divided into two major camps, evenly matched and preparing for war with each other. The confrontational situation before the war has reappeared.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the two major groups in Europe, on the one hand, are mainly composed of France and Russia, supported by the Little Entente; on the other hand, they are centered on Germany and Italy, and are allied with countries such as Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania. Britain is outside the group, still hoping to avoid the formation of a confrontational situation, and is indecisive. Other small countries, feeling the increasing urgency of the crisis, are all wandering in distress and have nowhere to turn for the sake of their own security. However, in recent months, the two major groups have been trying to win over countries to gain weight, and diplomats have been extremely active, traveling around and using all their scheming abilities. For example, France and Poland suddenly established a financial and military agreement in early September, restoring old ties, making the cooperation between Germany and Poland since 1934 a bubble. Poland's independence is due to the guarantee of the Treaty of Versailles. For the past two years, Hitler's arbitrary tearing up of the treaty has been regarded as waste paper, which has really made Poland feel cold. Moreover, the issue of Danzig and the Polish Corridor has always been the crux of the conflict between Germany and Poland. Poland cannot but urgently seek its own safety, change its plans, return to the French group, and restore the military alliance of 1920. Its significance is that France's diplomatic circle has been reconnected, and France, Russia, Poland, and the Little Entente stand on the same front. In the future, Germany will never be able to fly over Polish territory to attack Ukraine, and France, Russia, and the Little Entente will also assist Poland in resisting German invasion, and Germany's eastward plan will have one more obstacle. Another example is Hitler's third violation of the treaty in November, declaring the abolition of international navigation clauses, although it was intended to exchange various interests with the countries concerned, the greatest goal was to coerce Czechoslovakia to turn to it. Czechoslovakia is a newly emerging country after the war, relying on the treaty to maintain its survival, and has always had close relations with France. Germany and Italy have been deliberately trying to win over the Little Entente to weaken the power of France and Russia. Romania and Bulgaria may be easier to approach, but Czechoslovakia believes that if the Third Reich is once realized, it is tantamount to declaring its death sentence, so it must still adhere to the alliance between France and the Little Entente and the Soviet-Czech pact. Therefore, Germany abolished the navigation clauses, making Czechoslovakia no longer able to use the international waterways of the Elbe River and the Danube River, and no longer able to reach the free ports of Hamburg and Stettin in Germany, cutting off its access and threatening it. The seriousness of its significance is not only a major blow to Czechoslovakia, but also an indirect demonstration to France. Furthermore, in October, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano visited Berlin, held German-Italian talks, decided to improve Anglo-Italian relations, and proposed the conclusion of a Mediterranean</p>

<p>Gentleman's Agreement in order to win over Britain; In late November, the German-Japanese Agreement and the Italian-Japanese Agreement were successively announced, calling for an anti-Soviet front, corresponding to the East and the West; These are all manifestations of the Italian-German group's attempt to expand its influence. As for Belgium's announcement in October to restore its pre-war neutrality policy, although it is unfavorable to Britain and France, the degree of unfavorableness is not as great as it seems on the surface. Belgium has witnessed the League of Nations' authority gradually decline, the Locarno Treaty has been abolished, and the steps of Britain and France are inconsistent. The future Locarno Conference still has many difficulties, and the guarantee of its national border security has been almost lost. Therefore, it cannot but urgently rise up to seek its own safety, strengthen its national defense, and avoid participating in wars that are unrelated to its own country. However, the geographical situation is ultimately unchangeable. Whether Belgium can avoid repeating the mistakes of 1914 in the future war is uncertain. If Germany once again destroys Belgium's neutrality, Belgium will resist desperately, and Britain and France will not be able to sit idly by. As a result, Belgium will still rejoin the British and French sides. Belgium's statement that it does not intend to disregard various international obligations and continues to respect the Franco-Belgian military agreement is for this reason.</p>
<p>Regarding the Far East, since Japan exclusively occupied the Eastern Provinces after the September 18th Incident, the Naval Treaty, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Four-Power Treaty produced by the Washington Conference have been completely destroyed, the balance of power in the Pacific has been declared broken, the conflict between Japan, the United States, and Britain has gradually become acute, the opposition between Japan and Russia has become more and more intense, and the trend of understanding between Britain, the United States, and Russia has gradually formed. After Japan withdrew from the London Naval Conference in January and refused to participate in the 1936 New Naval Treaty, the Pacific situation turned to an even more dangerous stage. The countries concerned are competing to build ships and planning to defend the Pacific islands, all trying to protect their power with a large navy and a large air force policy. In order to protect its national border security, Russia has no choice but to actively deploy defenses and prepare to resist. The double-track railway of Ussuri in its Maritime Province and the double-track of the Siberian Railway from Lake Baikal to Boli have been completed. Forty-nine fortresses along the Heilongjiang River to the Ussuri River and the seven thousand miles of railway from the Black Sea to the Pacific Ocean are being rushed to build. The relationship between Japan and Russia is becoming more and more tense.</p>
<p>In summary, the entire world has been divided into two major camps. The post-war international equilibrium has changed into the confrontation of groups. The German-Italian group has great ambitions and intends to change borders; the French-Russian group strives to guarantee security and maintain the status quo. Once preparations are complete and strength is sufficient, the aggressive group will inevitably find an excuse to start a war, and the peaceful group will no longer tolerate it. With the many reefs in Europe and the complexity of the Far Eastern relations, a major conflict can be triggered almost anytime and anywhere. The outbreak of the Second World War is only a matter of time. Britain hovers between the two major groups, with a pivotal force. On the one hand, it wants to maintain the status quo, and on the other hand, it is deeply afraid of the rise of left-leaning forces. Its actions have the most noteworthy impact on the overall situation. According to its traditional conservative policy, it has always advocated preserving practical interests. At present, it seems that it still intends to reach an understanding with Japan in the Far East in order to preserve economic power, and to compromise with Germany and Italy in Europe in order to maintain its position in the Mediterranean, attempting to convene a new Locarno Conference to avoid war. Whether a major war can be avoided will be judged by whether the steps of Britain and France are consistent in the future Locarno Conference, and whether Britain and the United States can truly cooperate on the Pacific. The time is pressing, and a slight delay will cause irreparable regret. The cruelty of the last war is still in front of us. It is hoped that the politicians of all countries will learn from the past and expand their vision, and urgently seek effective ways to stop the war.</p>
<h3>A Review of Industrial Construction Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Wu Dingchang</p>
<p>Since President Chiang took over as head of the Executive Yuan, he has focused on industrial construction. Premier Sun Yat-sen said, "The priority of construction is people's livelihood." President Chiang also stated, "The current national crisis in China is multifaceted, but the most serious is economic exhaustion—a crisis of total national collapse." Today's industrial construction is truly urgent. I have been in charge of industrial administration for a year, and I have also been assisting the National Economic Council for several months. I uphold Premier Sun's teachings and President Chiang's instructions, and witnessing the current suffering of the people and the economic difficulties, I am even more motivated and dare not slack off. However, industrial construction is complex and multifaceted, and the success of a project often requires years. It is not easy to achieve much in a short year. As the new year approaches, I would like to offer a simple review of the measures taken in the past year, which I believe readers will appreciate.</p>
<p>The industrial construction of the past year, to speak of the most significant, can be summarized in several points:</p>
<p>1.  Agricultural Construction: Agricultural construction has many complexities. The recent rural bankruptcy has made the situation feel like everything needs to be rebuilt. In addition to striving to improve administrative efficiency, improving agricultural technology and adjusting rural finance are considered the most urgent tasks. It is essential to lay the foundation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(1) Technical aspects are the responsibility of the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute and the Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute. Although it is not easy to have significant records of technical improvements, the promotion of improved rice varieties, for example, has reached 31,038 mu in Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hunan provinces, and more than 14,000 dan of improved seeds have been selected, ready for expanded promotion next year. It can reach more than 200,000 mu. Demonstration farms for improved varieties have also reached 23 counties in Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hunan provinces. Cotton seed trials have been particularly successful. Si Zi No. 4 cotton seed has been popularized in North China, and De Zi No. 531 cotton seed has been extensively promoted in the Yangtze River basin. This year's bumper cotton harvest is significantly related to this. Next year, we will further promote it on a larger scale. Other crops such as wheat and various grains are also undergoing improvement trials. (2) In terms of agricultural finance, the establishment of the Farmers Bank of China has laid a solid foundation for agricultural finance. The bank's fixed capital and cooperative lending capital total 60 million yuan, with the government and banks each contributing half, to be fully paid up in five years. Depending on objective needs, the bank and the banking sector will also agree on the amount of circulating capital at any time. The regulations for cooperative banks have been promulgated, temporarily setting the capital of the central cooperative bank at a minimum of 10 million yuan, the capital of the provincial cooperative bank at a minimum of 1 million yuan, and the capital of the county cooperative bank at a minimum of 100,000 yuan. The national warehouse network has also been planned and is awaiting completion, divided into four levels: A, B, C, and D, to coordinate the national marketing of agricultural products. The total capacity is estimated at 200 million shi dan, requiring a total expenditure of 17,621,344 yuan. All are being carried out separately by the Farmers Bank of China. (3) For cooperative enterprises, administrative guidance has been completely unified, deciding to prioritize quality over quantity, in order to develop cooperatives in a standardized manner. We are also starting to fundamentally train talent, popularize cooperative education, and seek improvements in technical aspects. Cooperative technical personnel training courses and mobile cooperative technical lectures in various provinces and regions are scheduled to be implemented successively from mid-January next year. With the establishment of cooperative banks, substantial capital, and the easy development of cooperative enterprises, we aim to lay the foundation for improving rural cooperation.</p>
<p>2.  Industrial Construction: Industrial construction is the key to modernization and is closely related to the revival of the rural economy. Reviewing the industrial construction of the past year, there are several points that indicate progress. (1) Technical improvements. The improvement of industrial technology can be seen from the increase in patent approvals and industrial rewards. As of the end of November this year, 29 patents have been approved, which is a significant increase compared to 21 for the entire year last year and 25 for the entire year of 1934. We have adopted strict principles, rejecting more than 120 cases in the past eleven months. In terms of industrial rewards, as of the end of November, 11 exclusive manufacturing rights, 19 tariff exemptions, and 17 reductions in transportation costs for state-owned transportation enterprises have been approved, totaling 49 cases, which is 11 more than the 36 cases for the entire year last year. (2) Revitalizing large and small industries. The large industries that have made progress this year include: 1. The Central Machine Factory, with an initial operating cost of 600,000 yuan and an equipment cost of more than 123,000 pounds. The machinery purchased in England has been shipped in batches this year. The factory building has also been completed with iron casting, steel casting, and machine factories. We are currently negotiating cooperation methods with the Ministry of Railways in order to secure sales and start operations soon. 2. Alcohol industry. In addition to the joint state-private China Alcohol Manufacturing Co., Ltd., which started operations in January last year, Shaanxi Province has re-established an alcohol factory and four factories for pressing oil and removing foreign iron cylinders, with a total capital of 2.3 million yuan. In November this year, Tianjin Machine Manufacturing Alcohol Co., Ltd. was also established with a total capital of 500,000 yuan. 3. Paper industry. The capital of the joint state-private Wenxi Paper Mill has been set at 4.5 million yuan, and is currently underway. Guangdong Province has also established three new-style paper mills, and Fujian and Jiangxi provinces have also planned to reorganize the original paper industry. 4. Nitrogen industry. The sulfuric acid plant undertaken by Yongli Company in Liuhe County, Jiangsu Province, has completed all the factory buildings this year. In addition to the original company bonds of 5.5 million yuan, the factory has re-issued company bonds of 15 million yuan this year. The main facilities include sulfuric acid plant, nitric acid plant, synthetic ammonia plant, and water gas plant, which are large in scale. Also, Tianli Nitrogen Products Company, which had been preparing for a long time, has a capital of 1 million yuan. It officially started manufacturing at the beginning of this year, producing 8,000 pounds of liquid argon, 13,000 pounds of nitric acid, and 9,900 pounds of ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate, and ammonium chloride per year. 5. Vegetable oil industry. Vegetable oil is a major export commodity of our country. In 1935, oil exports reached 57,272,426 yuan, accounting for almost one-tenth of the total exports. Therefore, the rise and fall of the vegetable oil industry has a very significant impact on the entire national economy, especially tung oil. Almost all the tung oil needed in the world, except for Annam and India, is supplied by our country. According to customs statistics, since tung oil was listed separately under the vegetable oil category in 1913, it exceeded 3 million taels in that year, and has been increasing steadily since then. Although there have been occasional decreases in the middle years, it finally reached 41,582,879 yuan last year, jumping to the first place among export commodities. Its importance in international trade can be seen from this. However, due to the lack of purity in terms of quality and the lack of stability in terms of price and supply, the Ministry of Industry, in order to improve international reputation, has jointly established a vegetable oil plant in the tung oil producing areas of Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Guangxi provinces, with a capital of 2 million yuan, in cooperation between the government and private sector. Its main businesses are: (1) Agent for the storage and refining of tung oil; (2) Agent for the storage and refining of other vegetable oils; (3) Agent for undertaking mortgages, foreign exchange, customs declaration, transportation, and other matters that facilitate sales; (4) Refining lubricating oil; (5) Manufacturing oil paint coatings. The general office is located in Hankou, and oil plants are planned to be established in Shanghai, Hankou, Changsha, Changde, Wanxian, and Chongqing. The factory sites in Shanghai and Wanxian have been located, and the designs for the oil plants in Chongqing, Changde, Changsha, and Hankou are also in progress, and all can start operations in the middle of next year. In addition, new-style pressing machines will be purchased and distributed to various provinces to improve local pressing, in order to reduce costs and increase oil quality. 6. Sugar industry. The sugar industry has made more progress in recent years. The publicly operated ones include the sugar factories operated by Guangdong Province, and the newly established Neijiang Sugar Factory in Sichuan, with a capital of 10 million yuan, and the first phase of funding being 2 million yuan. The first factory will be built first, producing about 10,000 tons of sugar per year. Five factories will be completed successively within five years, with an annual output of 50,000 tons of sugar. Also, the Shandong Sugar Factory operated by Puyi Industrial Company was established in 1920 and was the first to use sugar beet to make sugar in our country. The capital is 2.5 million yuan. The factory is located at Huangtai Bridge in Jinan. The main product is machine-made white sugar, with an annual output of about 10,000 tons. If the sugar beet raw materials are sufficient, it can be increased to 50,000 tons. An alcohol factory is attached, using the waste honey left over from sugar production as a raw material for brewing alcohol. It was suspended in 1927 due to the political situation. It has been restarted in 1935 and has started manufacturing. The above points are also sufficient to get a glimpse of the improvement of the industrial situation in our country this year. However, the flour industry, the textile industry, and the silk industry are all important industries in our country. Due to the dumping of foreign goods and the impact of smuggling in North China, business is still difficult to expand. As for private small factories, 116 new factories have been registered this year, with a capital of more than 1,872,000 yuan. (3) Joint production and sales of the match industry. In recent years, the match industry has been in dire straits. In March of this year, the method of joint production and sales was specially approved. Cooperating with each other to limit production, 58 Chinese factories, 2 American factories, and 7 Japanese factories have joined. The business future has improved significantly. In short, the slight improvement in the above-mentioned industrial phenomena is just a small glimmer of light from the joint efforts of the people of the country. How to promote the future industry needs our continued efforts. For next year's industrial plan, the government believes that a national industrial distribution plan must be formulated: (1) Which heavy industries should be run by the central government; (2) Which light industries should be promoted by the central government and run by the people; (3) Which local industries should be subsidized by the central government and run independently or jointly by the provinces; (4) Which special industries should be subsidized by the central government and run jointly by the relevant provinces. The sources of capital, and the adjustment of supply and demand must be thoroughly discussed in order to avoid duplication, clarify responsibilities, and conduct a joint effort. We have now received an order from the President to complete this task by the beginning of next year (1937).</p>
<p>3.  Commercial Construction: The more important commercial construction projects in the past year include: (1) The preparation for the establishment of the National Goods Joint Sales Company. Under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry, this company will be temporarily organized by the central and local governments, national goods factories, and national goods companies, jointly raising funds. The capital is temporarily set at 2 million yuan, with the government jointly contributing one-third, and the national goods factories and companies jointly contributing two-thirds, using this as the center for promoting national goods. It has received sympathy from all parties, and the preparatory office has been established. (2) Establishment of a National Product Inspection Committee. Most national products do not have standard grades, are not suitable for modern trade, and are not conducive to sales. A National Product Inspection Committee was specially established in February this year, selecting experts as members, and successively holding inspections of Qimen Tunxi tea and Hunan rice, which is convenient for merchants. (3) Assisting the Nanyang commercial investigation. The China Industrial National Goods Trade Association believes that there are many overseas Chinese in Nanyang and trade is important. Therefore, it organized a Nanyang commercial investigation group this year, and carried national products for exhibitions on the spot. The Ministry of Industry provided assistance to this group. The group went abroad on July 16 and returned to Shanghai on October 26, passing through the Philippines and British, French, and Dutch ports, and received a warm welcome from the overseas Chinese. (4) Promoting international trade. The world economy showed a slight improvement this year, which was a good opportunity to promote overseas trade. The Ministry of Industry saw this and engaged in many activities, such as (1) increasing the inspection of export commodities. Major exports such as asphalt, which amounts to about 120,000 metric tons per year, and imports such as cotton seeds, which are also large in number, have been inspected. Grading and inspection of raw silk have also been implemented. (2) Promoting the export of tea and fruits. Special groups have been established in the International Trade Bureau. (3) Preparing to establish an import and export commodity management office. The method is under review. (4) Establishing a commercial attache in Japan. All are incentives to adjust international trade. The international trade situation has also improved this year. The import surplus has decreased relatively compared to last year. Comparing January to October of this year with the same period last year, the import surplus decreased from 336,550,548 yuan to 226,404,925 yuan, a decrease of 110,145,623 yuan (January was an export surplus). Domestic commerce has also been more active, which is perhaps a gratifying phenomenon.</p>
<p>4.  Mining Construction: There are also several points in mining construction that are worth mentioning. (1) Increasing private mining rights. From January to the end of November this year, the Ministry of Industry issued 166 private mining licenses, with a total area of 11,746 hectares, 38 ares, 28 millimeters, and 8,226 meters. There are 56 private small mining licenses, with a total area of 325 hectares, 27 ares, and 77 millimeters. There are 5 private prospecting licenses, with a total area of 354 hectares, 66 ares, 36 millimeters, and 4,991 meters. Among them, there are 128 coal mines, 2 barite mines, 4 asbestos mines, 6 fire clay mines, 1 arsenic mine, 1 kaolin mine, 4 gypsum mines, 2 mica mines, 3 graphite mines, 7 fluorite mines, 1 marble mine, 2 sulfur mines, 10 gold mines, 1 silver mine, 15 ore mines, 23 antimony mines, 2 manganese mines, 4 lead mines, 2 tin mines, 3 copper mines, 1 hoe mine, and 3 iron mines (small mines). (2) Oil exploration. The importance of oil is well known. "A drop of oil in wartime is like a drop of blood in the human body." There is no definitive conclusion on the oil problem in our country. Exploration work is urgent. The central government and the Shaanxi provincial government have cooperated in exploration. Oil layers have been penetrated in Yanchang and Yanchuan. Sichuan has also purchased machinery and will first explore in Jiangjin. Various research institutions are also actively conducting experiments on low-temperature oil refining. (3) Reorganizing the tungsten and antimony mining industries. The export trade of tungsten and antimony mineral sands is very large, but there is no plan, which can easily lead to abuses. Offices have been set up separately to reorganize and improve foreign trade. (4) Joint sales of the coal industry. The coal industry is extremely depressed due to mutual competition. On June 1st of this year, the Ministry of Industry specially convened a joint meeting of major coal mining companies, and on August 15th, the Coal Mining Industry United Office of the Republic of China was officially established in Shanghai, with the aim of jointly improving transportation and sales methods.</p>
<p>5.  Fisheries and Forestry Construction: (1) The establishment of the Shanghai Fishery Market, with a capital of 1.2 million yuan, is fully equipped with new facilities. From its opening on May 11 to the end of October, the accumulated operating income was 2,958,278.87 yuan for sea fish, 204,526.01 yuan for river fish, and 248,047.72 yuan for salted fish, totaling 3,410,854.8 yuan. (2) The preparation for the establishment of the Fishery Syndicate. The capital is divided into fixed and circulating capital, totaling 1 million yuan in the first year, and increasing year by year. The preparatory office was established in Shanghai on November 7th of this year. (3) Forestry construction. Regarding afforestation in the Northwest and other provinces, the provincial governments are urged to implement it separately. In the capital area, the number of surviving trees planted in the spring in the Jinzigang area was 2,463,731, and the number of surviving seedlings was 5,400,667.</p>
<p>In addition, the construction most closely related to the Ministry of Industry, such as the highway construction of the National Economic Council, has developed very rapidly. As of the end of June this year, the total length of the road lines was 163,715 kilometers, of which 97,472 kilometers were open to traffic and 16,793 kilometers were under construction. The total length of connecting roads in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Fujian, and the Northwest provinces as of October was 23,478 kilometers. In terms of railway construction, since the policy of reorganizing old roads and building new roads was implemented, the transportation of old roads has improved daily. The number of new roads has been increasing daily, and according to the President's five-year railway plan, it was decided to complete 8,139 kilometers of road lines within five years, breaking the 54-year record of only 8,111 kilometers (the current railway mileage in the country, excluding more than 2,000 kilometers outside the customs, is only this number). Currently completed lines include Tongpu Zhushao, Huainan, Nanyu, Tongsi, Sujia, and other lines. Those under construction include Xiangqian Chengyu, Jinggui, Nanping, Xibao, Hangshao and other lines. Those that have begun surveying include Baocheng Qiankun, Chuanqian Guangmei, Xianggui, Eshen, Bangzheng and other lines. Water conservancy construction such as: (1) The Daohuai River project, which has cost more than 20 million yuan over the years, will soon be completed. (2) The Yellow River water conservancy project, in addition to the breach-blocking and bank protection project, and the canal intermodal transport project, cost more than 10 million yuan. (3) The Yangtze River water conservancy project, such as the Jinshui gate construction in Hubei, the Wusong Yujidun bay interception, the Baimao River control gate, and the Jianghan main dike annual repair and other projects, cost more than 23 million yuan. (4) North China water conservancy projects, such as the Haihe management, the Hutuo River irrigation, the Longfeng River estuary gate construction, the Sanggan River first siltation area, and the Yongding River middle reaches reinforcement, cost a total of 10 million yuan. (5) South China water conservancy projects, such as the flood control projects in the Dongjiang, Xijiang, and Beijiang rivers, the Chencun River dredging, the opening of Huangpu Port, and the construction of quays in Kaiping Chikan, cost more than 4 million yuan. (6) Northwest water conservancy projects, such as the Shaanxi Jinghui Canal, Luohui Canal, Meihui Canal, Tao River Canal, and Ningxia Yunting Canal, cost a total of 5 million yuan. The reduction in natural disasters and the bumper harvest of agricultural products in recent years may not be unrelated to human affairs.</p>
<p>In summary, the above is just about the major industrial construction projects. With the vast territory of our country and the autumn of revival from ruins, a little construction is only one-thousandth or one-two-thousandth. The future is vast and requires a lot of effort. The government cannot but hope to work together with the people to move forward.</p>

<h3>A New Year's Contribution to Housewives in the 26th Year of the Republic!</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yan</p>
<p>The wheel of time has turned to the 26th year of the Republic. The people of the whole country, as usual, have a new atmosphere, new hopes, and are going to do new work. Our housewives, of course, should also have a new understanding and be prepared to take on new tasks. Here, the author would like to offer a few suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) From the New Year of the 26th year, absolutely do not play cards often, but recognize playing cards as an occasional social activity.</p>
<p>(2) From the New Year of the 26th year, do not agree with husbands or friends to often run to dance halls, go to big restaurants, and watch boring movies and dramas. At the same time, they must correct them - husbands and friends - to browse more conscious books and do more conscious things.</p>
<p>(3) Do not only pay attention to aristocratic decoration, do not paint eyebrows and lips, do not wear strange clothes, do not buy foreign cosmetics, and do not wear foreign fabrics.</p>
<p>(4) Work diligently to do things that are beneficial to the family and beneficial to the husband's affairs. Encourage husbands to engage in undertakings that are beneficial to the society and the country, and contribute generously to the country's war of resistance.</p>
<p>(5) Seek more scientific knowledge of the world, use scientific methods to judge and solve unexpected encounters and other family problems, and promote family happiness and eternal harmony between families. At the same time, it is also necessary to use scientific rationality to control and manage all activities of family affairs.</p>
<p>(6) Study more the ethical trends of family education, instill new rationality and ideological impressions into children, and promote new promising scientific methods to protect them. - Then the children will have true happiness.</p>
<p>(7) Buy more domestic daily necessities, promote more domestic silk clothes, and use domestic perfumes and powders.</p>
<p>(8) Do not wear high heels, promote domestic women's shoes, pay attention to natural health beauty, and overthrow the inferiority of morbid beauty! Do not like to perm hair.</p>
<p>(9) Do not waste the sweat and blood money of husbands, and do not live an idle and enjoyable life.</p>
<p>(10) Everyone should be a new clean, simple, hardworking, and virtuous housewife - this is also the true spiritual expression that a housewife should have.</p>
<p>- The above ten points, I think, should be regarded as a compulsory course for housewives this year. Housewives! The wheel of time in the 26th year of the Republic has already begun to move forward, and you can no longer have insufficient understanding and ignore your own tasks as in the past!</p>
<h3>New Year's Message</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>(1) To my pessimistic self, after being happy for a while when the National Army recovered Bailing Temple, I didn't expect that extreme joy would turn to sorrow. On December 12th of the 25th year of the Republic, I received the bad news of the Zhang Yang rebellion in Xi'an. I felt like I had been punched in the heart and was knocked down into a dark cloud, feeling depressed. It wasn't until 6:45 p.m. on December 25th when I heard the good news on the radio that Chairman Chiang had escaped and returned to Luoyang that I suddenly felt the dark clouds dissipate and saw the clear moon and bright wind again. So, I cancelled out my depression and happily rejoiced until today, New Year's Day. I am now in a happy mood to say a few words to the readers of the "Women and Children" special issue.</p>
<p>Looking back on the past year, the women's and children's circles in the country have indeed realized the seriousness of the national crisis and no longer live in extravagance and frivolity. They have gradually been able to work hard in their work. This is a very optimistic phenomenon. Especially after the Suiyuan War of Resistance broke out, women all over the country were sewing clothes with thousands of needles and threads to keep the soldiers on the front lines warm, and children all over the country were running around collecting money to relieve the hunger of the soldiers on the front lines. This is indeed a very effective stimulant to encourage the soldiers to bravely kill the enemy.</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang suffered misfortune during the Xi'an Incident, women and children across the country have also expressed their deep and sincere feelings. We have heard female students crying bitterly and worrying that the overall national situation will be unmanageable. Even my seven-year-old son, when returning from school, was shouting the slogan "If Chairman Chiang doesn't come out, China will be in trouble." This is enough to show that both women and children are concerned about national affairs and know that the country is lovable. In the past, pessimistic people, in view of the decline of national sentiment, often sighed and said, "If China doesn't perish, there is no reason." But after seeing the recent phenomena, I optimistically said, "If China perishes, there is no reason."</p>
<p>Today is New Year's Day in the 26th year of the Republic. Chairman Chiang is already presiding over national affairs and leading the entire nation to struggle for survival. I hope that women and children across the country will follow their husbands or parents and work together for the motherland. Know that this is not just Chairman Chiang's business, it is the business of our entire nation. Whether it is women or children, they must shrug their shoulders and help him to carry this heavy burden of saving the country together.</p>
<h3>Chinese Women in 1937</h3>
<p>— Shouzhen</p>
<p>China in 1936 passed amidst suffering. During this year, China endured the bullying of enemies, and even at the year's end, internal disgrace occurred! The demented traitors, not content with losing the four northeastern provinces, were preparing to forfeit the entire Republic of China! After agonizing reflection, we compatriots across the nation spent this hateful and shameful end of the year in grief and indignation!</p>
<p>Now, 1937 is beginning, and the crisis of the nation and the people weighs on the heads of every one of our citizens, whether male or female, old or young.</p>
<p>Today, the first day of the new year, we must use our new vision and new aspirations to prepare for struggle! Our female compatriots throughout China must stand on the same battle line as our male compatriots, support the government, help the government, resist enemies externally, eliminate traitors internally, and assist in construction, contributing one measure of strength to our nation for every measure we have, and doing one measure of work for the nation for every measure of talent we possess. Here, I would like to propose a few small plans to discuss with our female compatriots.</p>
<p>First, starting from today this year, let us all strive to enrich our own strength. Those of us who lack knowledge should study diligently. Those who lack experience should work hard. Those who lack common sense should engage with society as much as possible, learning from all aspects to improve ourselves. We must not sit idly by, complaining about others, nor should we vainly hope for others to assist us. Only in this way can we have real strength to contribute to society.</p>
<p>Second, we must do our utmost to restrain extravagance and increase production. On the one hand, we should strive to save on our own expenses, ensuring that not a single penny is wasted unnecessarily. On the other hand, we should do what we can within our abilities, absolutely not belittling ourselves or relying on men. For this is sufficient to affect the wealth of the entire nation and society through the economy of each family. We can only activate the national economy by reducing the burden on families.</p>
<p>Third, we must clearly see the current state of our country and the current global situation. We must begin to study various domestic and foreign issues and determine our own aspirations, not only resolutely supporting the country ourselves, but also instilling correct ideas into our young children, nurturing a healthy next generation of citizens.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must bravely and resolutely express to our male compatriots that we hope they will not underestimate our strength in the future. The cause is created by the entire people, regardless of male or female. We will not stand on the opposite battle line from them. We are all united. In various departments, they need our help, and we need their help. In short, everyone takes saving the country as the goal.</p>
<p>China in 1937 must rise from the heavy pressure! Chinese women in 1937 have also awakened from the heavy veils! Dear female compatriots, I believe you are all willing to offer this new model to women around the world!</p>
<h3>### Women of the 26th Year of the Republic</h3>
<p>— Yilong</p>
<p>The wheels of time keep moving forward. 1936, universally recognized as a year of war crisis, has passed peacefully. The new history of 1937 will unfold before our eyes. Will it bring war, or perhaps peace? Let's not talk about that for now, but first talk about the first question for us women ourselves.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Chinese women have also moved forward along with the wheels of time. Although, on the one hand, we see many urban women indulging in a life of makeup, on the other hand, we have seen thousands upon thousands of women shouting enthusiastic cries and shedding bright red blood. Especially since the outbreak of the war of resistance against the enemy in eastern Suiyuan, women across the country, even dancers and prostitutes (prostitutes in Suiyuan Province once organized a comfort group to go to the front lines), have been awakened by the sound of the enemy's cannons. Those with strength contributed strength, and those with money contributed money. Although this kind of women fighting for national survival cannot mobilize women from all walks of life to unite in a general mobilization, it at least shows the new growth of the Chinese women's movement in 1936, and at the very least, it has made the gentry who drive women back to the kitchen speechless.</p>
<p>Because the unprecedented crisis of the nation has fueled the rise of the women's movement. As a result, the advancing women of China in 1936 grew up in struggle. In 1937, we should hope to implement this spirit even more, and strive to learn the heroic posture of the women of the People's Front in the Spanish Civil War, and learn the revolutionary spirit of the martyr Qiu Jin. The first question for us women—striving for thorough national equality and freedom—can only grasp the banner of victory. Then, our two hundred million sisters can have a happy life like Soviet women and a free life like women in the newly emerging country of Turkey.</p>
<p>In the New Year's Day, we shouldn't talk about such disappointing problems in such a melancholy way. We should talk about how women seek happiness in the New Year and how to beautify themselves, but I honestly think about it, in today's severe national crisis, I feel that this first question for women is more important than anything else, and I can't help but write it out with enthusiasm. Finally, let me write down a few words from Mr. Jiping's interview with Ms. Yang Yixi again as my motto for Chinese women in 1937:</p>
<p>"Women's liberation cannot be realized independently of national liberation; if we women want to seek liberation, we should awaken women across the country to organize a united front to eliminate our enemies, feudal remnants, and imperialism."</p>

<h3>### New Year Fortune Telling</h3>
<p>— Lu Guowei</p>
<p>Children, today is New Year's Day. We should take advantage of the first day of the year to divine our own destiny and try to predict the good and bad luck in the coming year. I now have an interesting and scientific fortune-telling method to introduce to you.</p>
<p>Below are five questions about the fate of children during the year:</p>
<p>1. Will I be happy this year?</p>
<p>2. Will I be healthy this year?</p>
<p>3. Will I be promoted this year?</p>
<p>4. Will I encounter any unexpected disasters this year?</p>
<p>5. Which day will be my happiest this year?</p>
<p>After reading these five questions, children can choose one that you want to tell you the answer. For example, if you choose the fifth question, "Which day will be my happiest this year," you can take a needle, close your eyes, and arbitrarily prick a small hole in the fortune-telling table behind. Then open your eyes and see which row the needle hole falls on. If the needle hole is in the first row, then check the first answer table. If it is in the second row, then check the answer table. Now, suppose the needle hole falls in the first row, you check the first answer table to see what the fifth answer that matches the fifth question you asked earlier is. The answer is: "The day when the national army wipes out the puppet bandits will be your happiest day."</p>
<p>Below are the fortune-telling table and answer table</p>
<h3>### Fortune-Telling Table</h3>

<h3>### Family Forum</h3>
<p>— Hu Yeyin</p>
<p>If there are many children in a family, it is usually considered very troublesome; because children mostly like to move, so one day they are either quarreling and making noise, or you and I are not in harmony, and I can't get along with you. Adults feel that this kind of behavior is too annoying, so they shout loudly, or get angry and beat them up. As a result, the children cry and shout, but the result is still zero; the children make trouble, no matter how angry you get.</p>
<p>My family is like this. It's usually okay because they all go to school. Saturdays and Sundays are really terrible, simply killing people with noise.</p>
<p>In order to solve such a difficult problem, I proposed a family forum. The method is as follows: a meeting is held once a week, presided over by the mother or older children, but some refreshments should be prepared to help the elegant mood. There is no ceremony for the meeting. Everyone sits around the waist and mother tries to talk about things that are beneficial to the children, but it should not be a stern face, but lively and interesting: then each child should tell a story, or tell a joke, a riddle, or sing a song. Everyone laughs happily, and there are refreshments to eat.</p>
<p>Don't look at such a small family forum, its significance is very great. This is also considered a kind of family activity, and it contains very deep educational meaning: it can enable children to learn many things while talking and laughing, and it can also enable them to practice the ability to express opinions, because they must first prepare themselves before participating. If he reads a story and retells it, his ability to express himself will be practiced invisibly. Moreover, the mother can choose some older children to be the chairman, in order to create leadership talents.</p>
<p>On the negative side, it can reduce the time when children are naughty. Because they have to participate in this gathering, they must first prepare, or find a story, a joke: ... this will take them a lot of time to turn over books and look for them. When they read more books, they will play less?</p>
<p>Finally, if a family forum can be presided over well, the person presiding over can give systematic speeches to increase the children's organized knowledge, which is of great benefit to family education.</p>
<p>This is just a suggestion, and I hope for the guidance of housewives who implement it.</p>
<h3>### Welcoming the New Year</h3>
<p>— Sun Jingwen</p>
<p>Another year has come. Children, everyone is one year older. What do you feel?</p>
<p>Wild children who have not been lucky enough to go to school only feel that the weather is cold, the northwest wind is blowing tightly, the clothes on their bodies are too broken, and they are shivering... What another year has come? They are at a loss!</p>
<p>But what about the lucky children who have books to read! Ah! The big exam at school is coming soon, and winter vacation is coming soon. Or they will also think of getting one year older... The others are at a loss.</p>
<p>Really, in this era, not to mention children, even adults! Who isn't at a loss!</p>
<p>The new year has arrived. What "daily new, and again new" rotten tune, shouting is enough to be heartbroken! How can we bear to deceive innocent children and anesthetize children? Let's all celebrate the New Year happily! Pitiful China in this era, how to celebrate!</p>
<p>The fact does tell us that the new year has come again. Although the new year unfolding in front of us is a bit dim, no one can escape it, and everyone has to live.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, we should spend this new year well.</p>
<p>We all know that the enemy's oppression is getting more and more severe every day. Is this new year the year of national subjugation? No one dares to say for sure. But if our entire nation has an awareness of "seeking survival from war," we can believe that China will never perish. So is this new year the year of the revival of the Chinese nation? No one dares to say for sure either.</p>
<p>Children! Do you understand? The new year that is coming will determine the survival of our country and will determine whether we will be slaves. Are we willing to see China perish? Are we willing to be slaves of a conquered country?</p>
<p>We children, of course, can't shoulder guns and go to the front line to fight the enemy, but we can also do indirect work to save the country.</p>
<p>The new year has arrived. The following things that I talk about here, children should recognize and do!</p>
<p>Report what you know about current affairs to illiterate people.</p>
<p>Encourage your parents to work hard to save the country.</p>
<p>Especially work hard on your own studies.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to national affairs.</p>
<p>At any time, you should cry and shout, and send out your great innocent voices to inspire the courage of the entire nation to fight the enemy to the death.</p>
<h3>### Happy New Year</h3>
<p>(1) Wear new clothes (2) Wear a new hat (3) Be a new person</p>
<h3>### Children's Free Drawing</h3>
<h3>### Don't Waste Money</h3>
<p>— Du Yemu</p>
<p>On the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year, a bright and warm sun hung in the sky, which is exactly what the children were happy about. Ming'er, Zhi'er, Hui'er, and Mei'er, all four of them were wearing new clothes, even their hats, shoes, and socks were new. Of course, they were very happy, and their conversations were not as rude as usual, but today they were all speaking very politely.</p>
<p>Ming'er said: "I have four silver dollars. I want to buy a large foreign doll."</p>
<p>Zhi'er said: "I have three. I want to buy a small bicycle."</p>
<p>Hui'er said: "I have three too. I want to buy a foreign doll too."</p>
<p>Mei'er said: "I don't want anything. I want to buy a big leather ball!"</p>
<p>As she spoke, everyone laughed for a while. The stall selling small firecrackers was being carried over. Ah! The stall selling candies was also being carried over!</p>
<p>Zhi'er said: "I want to buy slam firecrackers!"</p>
<p>Ming'er said: "I want to buy cream candies to eat!"</p>
<p>Just as they were talking, suddenly Guo'er jumped over. Everyone was very happy to see Guo'er coming: "Guo'er, it's good that you came! Let's all buy some slam firecrackers and have a battle, shall we?" Hui'er said this. But Mei'er said: "Let's buy some milk candies and everyone roll copper coins, shall we?" Ming'er jumped up and shouted: "Okay, okay!"</p>
<p>But Guo'er said: "Children! Isn't our China very dangerous? Aren't the enemy troops attacking us in Suiyuan now? Children! We should save money and donate it to the soldiers on the front line who are resisting the enemy. You must know that the respectable and beloved soldiers on the front line are fighting the enemy with blood and flesh. We people in the rear should also contribute money if we have money, so I donated all the New Year's money that my parents gave me to the soldiers on the front line who are resisting the enemy. In the future, when our nation is free and liberated, then won't our New Year be even happier?"</p>
<p>Everyone thought that Guo'er's words were very correct. Everyone did not waste money, and decided to save the money and donate it to the soldiers on the front line who were resisting the enemy.</p>
<h3>### Standing on the Same Front Line</h3>
<p>— Kangjian Zhai Fu</p>
<p>On the morning of the Yunnan Uprising Anniversary, that is, Easter, foreigners, old and young, men and women, were celebrating and welcoming the arrival of 1937. But we, the people of the whole country who have a little knowledge, regardless of age, gender, are frowning and inwardly trembling, fearing that a great disaster is about to come, and that the nation and the people will fall into eternal destruction: everyone is wholeheartedly hoping that the Xi'an mutiny incident can be resolved one minute earlier; our leader can escape danger one minute earlier, so that our country, our entire nation, can get rid of the clouds and see the light again. Only then can all our people, old and young, men and women, eat New Year's Eve dinner more comfortably and welcome the arrival of the 26th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Sure enough, that evening, the telegram came that our leader had safely escaped danger. The entire city of Shanghai was immediately filled with firecrackers and cheers. Needless to say, the entire Chinese people in China and even overseas would be as enthusiastically happy as if they were drunk and crazy after receiving this news; I don't know how many thousands of men, women, old and young would be so happy that they would shed tears. When we read Chairman Chiang's instructions to Zhang Yang in Xi'an, even people of iron and stone would be moved to tears. With this, turning misfortune into good fortune, everyone can almost relax and celebrate the New Year.</p>
<p>It turns out that this Xi'an mutiny, where the leader suffered, during the fourteen days from beginning to end, the news reported in the newspapers showed the popular sentiment and public opinion, which can be regarded as giving our entire nation an extremely broad, precise and accurate psychological test. During these fourteen days, the people across the country were indignant and nervous, and the sincere expressions of grief and joy were not faked at all. The reason why there are such consistent and sincere expressions of concern is because our entire nation has suffered unprecedented humiliation and encountered serious national disasters that everyone has never experienced in their lives in recent years. Everyone has clearly understood in their hearts that in order to get rid of this unprecedented humiliation and to get rid of this extremely serious national disaster, except for following our hardworking and struggling supreme leader, standing on the same front line and fighting the enemy to the death, there is no second path to be found. If the battle line of our nation loses its true leader and returns to the previous situation of one country with three public officials and no leader, then our own front line will be chaotic first, and then the enemy will break it without attacking it. Isn't this called "self-inflicted sins cannot be survived"?</p>
<p>Today is the New Year's Day of the 26th year of the Republic of China. What we can celebrate is that all our people, men, women, old and young, even those who have gone astray in the past, are now united and give a "group New Year's greeting" to our government and our leader. From now on, we will resolutely stand on the same front line!</p>
<h3>### New Year Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Jiping</p>
<p>"Year after year passes, and the national fortune has not changed!" These two sentences can probably represent the psychology of ordinary people. Of course, the unification of the country and the success of national policies are not matters of a day or two. But I believe that our nation, after so many years of suffering, has made considerable progress, and there is a glimmer of light in the future. People used to say: "If China does not perish, there is no justice!" Now it can be changed to "If China does not perish, there is natural justice!"</p>
<p>To celebrate the New Year, we must have the spirit of inheriting the past and opening up the future. Everyone reflects on the mistakes of last year and sets the plan for this year: How will I strive for myself and change to social service? Serve the country? This is the great way to save the country in one's own position.</p>
<p>The family is a cell in the national organization. It must first be well-organized to enjoy happiness. I have never seen a corrupt family that can produce excellent citizens. Therefore, a happy family is the starting point for promoting all our undertakings; and most of this responsibility rests on the shoulders of women.</p>
<p>Children in the past only knew how to be filial to their parents, but modern children must love the country even more. You should understand that my survival is protected by the country, and the survival of the country depends entirely on the power of the people. Therefore, children should strive to cultivate the five educations, and it is better to say that they are preparing to be loyal to the country than to repay the kindness of their parents in the future.</p>
<p>Starting from the 26th year, children should earnestly take on the responsibility of "little teachers", and immediately convey the knowledge they have acquired to those who have dropped out of school. Naturally, teachers are the advocates of the "little teacher system"!</p>
<h3>### Little Black Charcoal Spends the New Year</h3>
<p>— Written by Jiang Yuqi</p>
<p>㊀ The New Year has arrived, let's all beat the gongs and drums.</p>
<p>㊁ "Ten-Turn Gongs and Drums" are very lively.</p>
<p>㊂ We walk all the way, beat all the way, the louder the better.</p>
<p>㊃ Haha! Little Black Charcoal's bronze drum is broken.</p>
<h3>### A Foreign Doll</h3>
<p>— Qin Chen</p>
<p>On a New Year's Day when the sun shines all over the earth, although the season has not yet jumped out of the scope of winter, when the wind blows on people's faces, they don't feel cold at all; especially those children who are running, shouting, and messing around on the street, in the yard, and indoors are particularly excited. Their little faces are flushed, and some of them are sweating!</p>
<p>K City is a remote county far away from big cities. It is usually very quiet, but once New Year's Day comes, the air suddenly becomes much more tense. Schools and shops are hanging up national flags, and women and children are putting on new clothes. Those who sell clay figures, picture albums, and masks are doing very good business. Although the quiet residential areas like Houshi Street have also added a lot of noise, most of which belongs to children! Because no vehicles or horses have ever passed through the street, those children have occupied the entire street in groups; some are playing with clay grandmas, some are wielding knives and guns, some are pulling tops, and some are waving small paper flags. Almost none of them are empty-handed. If there is one, it is Xiao Wei!</p>
<p>Today, the neighbors have more toys, a very large foreign bronze drum, a very nice little horn; all the toys that can be bought in K City are spread out in front of him, but he can't touch them at all. He can only stand aside in a daze. His only hope is to wait for his mother to come home at night and bring him a mask that she promised him; but he hasn't even eaten dinner, and it's still so long until night, how can he bear it? He thinks that Wu Bao in the big room is usually the best to him, maybe Wu Bao will be willing to lend him his little leather ball to roll for a while? But as soon as he opened his mouth, Wu Bao made a face and left. He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry, when suddenly two people came from the east, one carrying a pole, and a guest wearing foreign clothes. They asked a few words to an old man on the street, and that old man pointed at himself. The guest immediately put on a smiling face and ran over to hug him.</p>
<p>"Are you Xiao Wei? Where's Mom? I'm your dad!" The man said excitedly.</p>
<p>Of course, Xiao Wei doesn't know his dad! He doesn't even know that he has a dad: he doesn't know what good it is for him, but his face is flushed and he's about to cry; his dad knows he's unfamiliar with him, so he opens a paper package clipped under his waist, takes out a small foreign man with eyes and limbs that can move, and gives it to him with a smile. Xiao Wei was in a daze,</p>
<p>"A foreign doll! A foreign doll!" All the children around shouted.</p>
<p>Dad then signaled the porter to carry a few pieces of luggage into the house, and Xiao Wei smiled tightly holding the foreign doll.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Celebrating New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Celebrating New Year's Day is originally a routine article. Since the founding of the Republic of China, twenty-five New Year's Days have passed. This year's New Year's Day is the twenty-sixth. Isn't it an ordinary and extremely mundane thing, like a child growing to twenty-six years old?</p>
<p>Therefore, writing articles celebrating New Year's Day is like writing birthday prefaces for others. No matter what the person is like, you always have to write a few sentences of congratulatory clichés and string together a few far-fetched and contrived praises to flatter them. Otherwise, it wouldn't seem like a birthday celebration preface, and it would lose the meaning of celebration.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, although twenty-five New Year's Days have passed, we have been living through internal troubles and external threats, natural disasters and man-made calamities. Even if we wanted to string together a few congratulatory words, they would be artificial and not easy to feel sincerely. It's either looking back on the past or hoping for the future, which has become an old tune. Not only is it unsettling to write, but the listeners are also inevitably tired of it. However, this year, the celebration is different. There are three solid and genuine reasons for celebration that have never existed before, and they must be written about in detail to inform the readers.</p>
<p>First, the unification of the Republic of China. Although the slogan of unifying the whole country has been chanted for a long time, true unification has not yet been achieved. Since Chen Jitang stepped down and went abroad last year, the southwestern leaders have cooperated with the central government with one heart and mind, as close as brothers. Not only is the politics unified, but also the military; not only the military, but also the economy. This situation is really the best situation since the Republic of China. This is the first thing to celebrate.</p>
<p>Second, the recovery of Bailing Temple. The situation in North China has been disrupted by bandits and traitors since the September 18th Incident, and it is almost impossible to manage. The battle of Bailing Temple last year caused heavy losses to bandits and puppets, who dared not underestimate us. Although Bailing Temple is an inherent territory of our country, it has been completely occupied by bandits and puppets in recent years, so government orders could not be implemented. Recently, we fought hand-to-hand to take it back. Such a victory can be regarded as the first major victory in the history of the Republic of China. In the future, we can work hard to recover lost territories and restore national rights. This is the second thing to celebrate.</p>
<p>Third, Generalissimo Chiang's safe return to Nanjing after escaping danger. The Xi'an Incident was indeed beyond our expectations. People generally worried about Generalissimo Chiang's safety. Unexpectedly, within two weeks, Zhang and Yang were able to come to their senses and happily send Generalissimo Chiang back to Nanjing, and Zhang also came to Nanjing to plead guilty. This is not only a victory of the national people's psychology, but also due to Generalissimo Chiang's efforts in nationalization. This turned a disaster into a blessing, which is a miracle in history. This is the third thing to celebrate.</p>
<p>In addition, last year's nationwide harvest and the people's prosperous life are not enough to be celebrated. However, these three facts are not accidental. They must be the result of Generalissimo Chiang's great achievements of hard work in recent years and his far-sighted plans. Therefore, the past achievements are like this, and the future hope is endless. Therefore, past New Year's Days had nothing to celebrate, but this year's New Year's Day should be celebrated by the whole country.</p>
<h3>Having Words is Worse Than Having None</h3>
<p>— Lingxi</p>
<p>Firecrackers bid farewell to the old year;</p>
<p>New peach charms for thousands of households.</p>
<p>Jingchu Chronicle of Seasons: "Boards are set up next to the door, made of peach wood, and painted with the images of the gods Shen Tu and Yu Lei to suppress evil, called peach charms." Because they are changed every three years, they become a story of the New Year, and later spring couplets became peach charms.</p>
<p>In the new year of universal renewal, everything in the world should be spruced up. Even if the people in the house are so miserable that they have no food to eat or clothes to wear, the façade must be decorated. So no matter how dirty or how old the two large doors are, the blood-red spring couplets must be pasted. If you run through the streets and alleys in the New Year, you can prove that what I said is not a lie. If the cycle goes on and on, and everything is really renewed, then this renewal should be reflected in the spring couplets. This also shows that Chinese people love to work hard on the façade and value it more than anything else.</p>
<p>Speaking of spring couplets, I remembered an anecdote. Although I can remember it, I can't remember it clearly. It was about a scholar in a certain place. When the end of the year was approaching, the villagers bought red paper and sincerely asked him to write spring couplets. He didn't refuse and accepted all the red paper. On New Year's Eve, the villagers asked him for the spring couplets. He was in no hurry and returned the rolls of red paper to everyone. They took the red paper and pasted it on the gate, but saw that there wasn't a single word on it. They went to question the scholar, who replied with a smile: "Having words is worse than having none!" The word "words" is a homophone for "affairs." Chinese people are born afraid of trouble, and who doesn't want to have a peaceful and uneventful year? So after hearing the scholar's words, they felt that the auspicious words were good and expressed their joy and gratitude. Since then, it is said that the spring couplets in that place have no words, becoming a fashion. Upon researching this reason, I know that it is not purely for auspicious words. Half of the reason is that it is not easy for country people to find someone to write spring couplets, so they feel that having words is worse than having none. Originally, spring couplets are troublesome things!</p>
<p>New Year's newspapers want to publish special issues, I don't know what good man came up with this idea. Therefore, people who can write can't escape this New Year's hurdle, and they have to write a few words for people who are chasing them like debts. In fact, people who can write are not as stingy as rich people who pluck a hair. It's just that it's not good to write randomly at this time of year, and they often write messy words. In the New Year, everyone wants to get lucky. If they write some trouble for writing words, wouldn't it be a bad omen for the whole year? So although I was forced to finally pick up the pen, I suddenly thought of the scholar's words, "Having words is worse than having none," and deeply felt that what he said is a warning for our friends who like to write.</p>
<p>Indeed, "Having words is worse than having none." Don't you see that newspapers often leave some blank space to harmonize the reader's eyesight because there are too many words written, which is not good? And readers also feel that "having words is worse than having none," and will give more interest and attention to the blank space left.</p>
<p>Therefore, I also think that it is really necessary to have "having words is worse than having none," so I don't want to write anything else besides writing the title. What I wrote above is just an aside, explaining the meaning of "having words is worse than having none."</p>

<h3>Sending Off the Old Year and Welcoming the New Year</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>When the last page of December 31st is torn off the calendar, in a few hours, it will be the beginning of 1937. This transition will naturally evoke a different feeling in people's minds. When we say the two words "New Year," it seems that there is a "new" atmosphere waiting for us to approach it. If you want to say that "the New Year is really worth celebrating," then it is on this point of bright hope for the coming year.</p>
<p>I have thought carefully about why people have such a passionate heart of hope for the future in the exchange of a year. It must be that life was really not very good in the past year. At the end of the year, I can't wait for the bad luck of the past year to pass along with the passing of the year. In the coming year, we must try our best to make life go to good luck. It seems that there are two popular sayings in the society: "Toad hopes for sunny days, poor people hope for the coming year." According to this saying, I think toads must love sunny days and hate rainy days. After many days of unpleasant rain, it can only look forward to the sunny days coming soon. Similarly, poor people have lived a hard life for many years, and have no way out, only to hope for good luck at the end of the year. According to this saying, the reason why people place infinite hope on the coming New Year is precisely because the "old year" was too unsatisfactory. This reason is correct.</p>
<p>According to this, the reason why we are particularly enthusiastic about welcoming the New Year now is precisely because the past year was too uncomfortable. To be specific, there are too many uncomfortable things. Generally speaking: the oppression of people by people, the tragic killings, the shameless deception, responding to individuals, life is getting more and more difficult year by year... all kinds of dark scenes can be regarded as playing the past year. In this atmosphere of darkness and separation, we who have suffered so much, don't everyone have great hope for the coming year?</p>
<p>Hope is not wrong. It's just that the biggest problem is that we can't just hope in vain. Just like the toad's hope for sunny days to come, and the poor man's hope that he can have good luck next year, if we only satisfy ourselves with this kind of boring self-comfort, the result will definitely be the same as the poor man, spring goes and summer comes and winter comes again, and we will always spend each and every New Year in sadness and mourning. Our hope must be realized by practical actions, and hope must be based on reality. Only in this way can our hope be beneficial, and can guide us out of the abyss of pain and into the road of freedom and light.</p>
<p>Calculating the past year, the world has passed in painful struggles, with flesh and blood and shells flying across. Around us, the enemy's offensive has advanced another stage, and the various poisonous strategies of the traitors have far surpassed the ways of attacking our nation in the past. But on the other hand, we also see a bright road for our nation to move towards struggle. The nationwide enthusiastic support for the Sui Movement is one aspect of this struggle scene. We must also expand this increasingly expanding and deepening survival movement. So that we, who have been in oppression and slaughter for a long time, can finally raise the banner of freedom, step on all the defeated enemies, and sing our triumphal song. If we want to say that "the New Year" is really worth celebrating, then let us entrust our only hope to the year that is just beginning.</p>
<h3>Hopes for 1937</h3>
<p>— Ruoying</p>
<p>I'm really afraid of such "topic assignments," but I have to write them. Well, let's list some hopes to welcome the just-arrived 1937.</p>
<p>My hopes are:</p>
<p>㊀ Forecasters should not make the terrible top predictions that World War II will break out this year. This is what we firmly oppose.</p>
<p>㊁ I hope that Abyssinia and Spain can, with the support of the world's people's front, recover their lost territories and consolidate their countries.</p>
<p>㊂ The time has come to the point where it is unbearable. I hope that the war of resistance against the enemy can start immediately, and that all the lost territories can be completely recovered within this year.</p>
<p>㊃ I hope that the great men and ordinary people of China can unite under the banner of resisting the enemy, resisting imperialism externally, and opposing feudal forces and traitors internally.</p>
<p>㊄ I hope that national defense literature, drama, and film will powerfully help the unity of the national salvation front. So that our works can become more lively and stronger trumpets of national salvation. They should be daggers, machine guns, and mortars, not dull and rusty things.</p>
<p>㊅ I hope that everyone will work hard to create and produce more meaningful works. Use your own life to enrich and complicate the content of your works. Oppose self-praise, mutual praise, closing doors, and all the strange phenomena in the literary world.</p>
<h3>I Want to Correct a New Year's Cliche</h3>
<p>— Xinan</p>
<p>Get rich! Congratulations!</p>
<p>"Congratulations! Get rich!" When we meet during the New Year, everyone says this. It can be seen that everyone hopes to get rich, and the greatest purpose in life is, after all, to get rich.</p>
<p>However, "Congratulations, get rich" is still a bit of hope. Hope cannot necessarily become a reality. Therefore, I want to say this New Year's cliche in reverse, "Get rich! Congratulations!" "Only getting rich is worth" congratulations." If we regard hope as reality, it may actually become a reality.</p>
<p>To make getting rich a reality, you must have a way to make money. So, what is the way? Readers must ask this question when they see this, so let me tell you:</p>
<p>㊀ To "have the talent of money," you must have "the talent of no money;" only by having "the talent of no money" can you create "the talent of money."</p>
<p>㊁ To get rich, you also have to look at each person's "forehead." "Forehead" contains two meanings; the first saying is that "luck is on the forehead," because people who are walking on the right path must have a "shining" forehead, otherwise, people who are walking on the wrong path have a "dirty" forehead. But the "forehead" mentioned here refers to a "shining" forehead, not a "dirty" forehead. That is to say, getting rich depends on luck, and luck can also be said to be opportunity. The second saying is that getting rich ultimately requires using the brain, and the brain is in the forehead. According to a certain foreign psychologist, when a person uses their brain, there are often traces on the forehead, which cannot be seen with the naked eye, but can be measured with special machines, so the so-called "forehead" means that to get rich, it is also necessary to use the brain.</p>
<p>㊂ To get rich, you must have knowledge. Knowledge comes from books. Chinese people often use the words "wealth" and "sex" to tempt young people to study (in fact, it can be said that it is not temptation, but to cater to their preferences). They say, "There are houses of gold in books," and "There are beauties like jade in books." That is to say, to satisfy your desires for wealth and sex, you must bury yourself in books.</p>
<p>㊃ Some people say that what you said above is not right. Does studying necessarily lead to wealth! Don't you see that the more you study, the poorer you become, and the more knowledge you have, the less likely you are to get rich! However, this cannot be blamed on studying, but on why he is not smart enough, and has a poor appearance, and can only have a plain wife, live in a broken house, sit on a cold bench, and eat a bowl of salted rice. His fate is like this, what is there to complain about. The houses of gold and beauties like jade mentioned here are for people who can become officials by studying. Among all kinds of businesses in China, there is nothing like being an official with high profits and low capital. Although there are many honest and self-loving people, many of those who enter and exit beautiful wives and concubines, dancing pavilions, and foreign cars are nobles who "leap over the dragon gate in three stages, and become famous overnight." Therefore, those who study only want to become officials as the greatest and best way out, and they are not willing to risk great hardships and use capital to engage in industry and commerce.</p>
<p>㊄ "Having land is having wealth" is a saying that is certainly correct. Now there are land merchants who also have land, so, looking at the general trend, this year's land merchants can be very happy.</p>
<p>㊅ "Having wealth is having power" is a proverb. Those who have power have wealth because they have power, so everyone wants to curry favor with them. Because they want to curry favor, even if they have no wealth, they will have wealth. If those who have wealth have no power, it is hard not to say what will happen, but "a common man is not guilty, but possessing jade is a crime," precisely because they have no power. Therefore, power is also a most important condition for getting rich.</p>
<p>In short, congratulations can only be said when you get rich. Therefore, the first time I pick up a pen this year, I want to wish readers wealth! Congratulations! If you can get rich, then I will also get rich. Let me congratulate myself! Congratulations! Congratulations! To each other! To each other!</p>
<h3>New Year's Fun</h3>
<p>— Zhou Muzhai</p>
<p>It's just celebrating the New Year, why do you have to say something temporary beforehand? If you say it's bitter, it's out of time and offends taboos. If you say it's happy, no matter how happy, happy, happy you say, it's not happy at all, it's very bitter. If you're not happy in the first place, but you insist on saying you're happy, the old-fashioned way of saying it is "forcing a smile," and the fashionable way of saying it is "a tearful smile," which is an appropriate example, close to a prostitute, which is one kind of bitterness. Even if you're happy, if you vent it out first, it's better to say what's bitter, and vent out your happiness, which is "although it's not said in words." Bitterness and happiness are opposites, which is a second kind of bitterness. New Year's Day, saying good things to unrelated people, especially those in the streets and alleys, beggars who suddenly appear in front and rush behind, writing articles to readers can generally be said to be unrelated, but saying good things in the New Year happens to have a ready-made term—"literary beggar," which is a third kind of bitterness. Mencius said: "A gentleman has three joys, and ruling the world is not one of them." Here it can be said that a petty person has three kinds of bitterness, being close to petty people and staying away from gentlemen, which is another kind of bitterness.</p>
<p>Having said that saying it's bitter is out of time and offends taboos, I also have to talk about the bitterness of saying it's happy, which is the same as being out of time and offending taboos. However, according to the meaning of venting happiness, "playing the qin under the Chinese cork tree, making fun of it in bitterness, may not be without gain. In this day and age, it's okay to say what's bitter, too. Because I had to say something temporary beforehand, I finally have something to say, which is another gain.</p>
<p>But this is after all saying the reason why, and it's certainly not saying the reason for. But I still feel that there's nothing to say, and I still have to "assume it." Then, the best way to celebrate the New Year is just to celebrate the New Year, but it must be without any discount of bitterness, or the discount should be smaller, and not overshadow the happiness of celebrating the New Year. So secondly, when speaking in the New Year, there must be things that can be said that are in time and do not offend taboos.</p>
<h3>Five Great Hopes</h3>
<p>— Chen Wu</p>
<p>It's another manuscript for the New Year's special issue. As for my own major plans for the year, there are "secrets that cannot be revealed." Let's write a little about my hopes for the world and China.</p>
<p>First, I hope that the major powers of the world will all have many new colonies, and everyone will be "very satisfied."</p>
<p>Second, I hope that the red Soviet Union will collapse naturally without any effort from the major powers (especially Germany and Japan). Whether it is Semenov or someone else who comes to power, kills Stalin, digs up Lenin's tomb, and makes 90% of the workers and peasants become serfs again.</p>
<p>Third, I hope that the Spanish People's Front suddenly feels that they are wrong, and kneels outside the gate of Madrid to respectfully welcome Hitler's "Jade Teacher."</p>
<p>Fourth, I hope that Germany's Thalmann suddenly becomes a believer of Hitler?</p>
<p>Fifth (deleted)</p>
<p>Okay! Let's just have these five hopes. The last statement is naturally "It doesn't matter if I'm poor!"</p>
<h3>A Short Breath Sent to a Friend</h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>×: Your letter has been received. When I picked up my pen to write back, I suddenly remembered that today is already the eve of New Year's Eve, and I couldn't help but feel a little surprised, and my heart even felt a little cold.</p>
<p>Another year! We heard my soul shout like this, and the voice was hoarse and heavy. I can't tell what these four words mean. Time is naturally very precious to mankind. It once created civilization, and it also ruthlessly destroys the old world; but the road of history is so long, we live in this tragic era, and what we play is just an insignificant role. A long string of precious days, like chewing chicken ribs, is spent in meaningless sorrow and fatigue. Occasionally, when I wake up, I think about this situation, and my soul is as painful as being bitten by a poisonous snake.</p>
<p>In this year, I spent the price of three hundred and dozens of days of life. What did I get for others and for myself?</p>
<p>You probably understand my temperament and believe that I am not such a selfish and muddled person. I am willing to live a more meaningful life. If my hands and brain can also contribute a little to promoting this era, I am willing to contribute everything I have. But what is pressing on me is a heavy burden of life, and my limited youth can only be buried in these ordinary and insignificant years. Friend, think about it for me, what a cruel punishment this society imposes on us!</p>
<p>I heard that you are going to Beiping after the New Year, and this news gave me a little sadness. But I think it's good for you to run away once if you have the opportunity. Living a peaceful life like stagnant water in an old small town may be a kind of happiness, but I always feel that this is a waste of life. In Beiping, the "cultural city" that barely survives under the enemy's iron hooves, you may be able to see a little more. After the New Year, because of the change of years, I hope you will also dare to change your life.</p>
<p>I've been in a bad mood these past few days, and as soon as I picked up my pen, I burst into so many complaints. However, ×, please rest assured that I still have the courage to live, and I am not pessimistic. Maybe I can become more solid in the future. I hope you will also give me encouragement.</p>
<p>I expect that when you receive this letter, it will be the beginning of the New Year, so let me wish you "Happy New Year" here.</p>
<p>Written hastily, I can't express all my thoughts. Winter is cold, I hope you take care!</p>
<h3>Writing to Myself</h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>New Year's Day Thoughts</p>
<p>Including this year, I have spent two New Years in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Last year on New Year's Day, I remember writing the following paragraph: "...Everyone, from the moment they are born, needs to eat, live in houses, and sleep. In other words,</p>
<p>Continued on page 5</p>
<h2>Page 37</h2>
<h2>Page 38</h2>
<h2>Page 39</h2>
<p>: They all need to live. If they are not confused, I think they should all think about how to plan their lives from New Year's Day onwards. What the landlord and the farmer plan may be to buy a few more acres of land, plant a few more loads of grain, and buy a few more oxen within the possible range. As for myself? Not a landlord, nor a farmer, I don't have that many plans, just one wish: to talk less and do more..."</p>
<p>For a full twelve months, I fought life based on this unpretentious article, like a lone boat tossing in angry waves. Although there have been times when leaping angry waves have hit this lone boat, and there have been times when a storm has tried to capsize it and push it to the bottom of the sea. However, this lone boat struggled, breaking away from the raging waves. On the vast, restless sea, in the dark, stuffy nights, groping and crawling, heading towards the dawn. Now, I have safely passed a certain stage of the journey, and I am starting to set the second course for myself.</p>
<p>As the pages of the calendar are turned and torn off, there is always a strange feeling in my heart, lonely and desolate. I often ask myself: "Another day has passed, young man, on the journey of life, your life is also shorter by a day, but what have you done?" I am often ashamed, although I have done a lot of things this year, read a considerable number of books, and also written some articles. However, I have never been satisfied with myself. Sometimes I hold a competitive spirit and an explosive heart, and write with a pen. But when I look back at it a second time, I can't help but feel despair. I haven't written down the words I wanted to write. In this way, I believe that I have completely failed.</p>
<p>Two years ago, in a quiet village in the south, whenever the night was quiet, I often fell into dreamlike meditation. I kept thinking about the desert, thinking about the camel trudging with heavy burdens, and then it seemed that a voice was attached to my ear, saying in a low voice: "Just be a camel!" This voice often echoed in my ears, bewitching me. Finally, I decided to take a body of earthy air and a broken suitcase, like a camel, and step on the Bund, and live like a camel, full of courage and hope, without knowing fatigue, and without knowing failure. But now I am beginning to doubt whether this spirit is still there. The confidence to be a camel is a bit shaken.</p>
<p>"...Live a good life, young man, you have a future." This is the encouragement my friend gave me.</p>
<p>From this year on, I feel that I need to calm down even more, talk less, do more, don't disappoint my friends, and don't let myself be discouraged.</p>
<h3>Two Chapters of Unfeelingness on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— Wan Qiu</p>
<p>When I was young, the New Year's Day arrived, and I was busy wearing new clothes and flower hats; as I grew older, the New Year's Day arrived, and I was busy receiving distinguished guests, talking and reminiscing; when I was abroad, the New Year's Day arrived, and I was filled with thoughts of my homeland, inevitably gazing westward with melancholy. Each period, each period, had its own feelings for the New Year's Day during that time, although those feelings were all different.</p>
<p>But in recent years, after entering society, I have to rely on my own brainpower and physical strength to maintain my livelihood. All the beautiful dreams have disappeared, and cold reality is in front of me. Whether it is the New Year, the Old Year, New Year's Eve, or New Year's Day, without rice, I cannot cook, and without money, I cannot survive a single day. Whether it is the New Year or not, there is no difference at all, so now I have become unfeeling towards New Year's Day. (One of the Chapters on Unfeelingness of Old)</p>
<p>This unfeelingness is not limited to New Year's Day, but also to daily life. When I was studying at school, I often had dreams of endless hope, and life often contained some poetry, so the interest in writing novels and poems would spring up. But what about now? The books I read are words, the manuscripts I read are also words, and even when I meet friends and chat, I still cannot escape the realm of these "words." It is like a person who has eaten too much; as soon as I see words, my appetite feels bloated. Where does the interest in writing words come from? Therefore, I would like to advise friends who aspire to create that they must not choose the profession of editor. Once you become an editor, you will reduce your creative power. (Two of the Chapters on Unfeelingness of Old)</p>
<p>This year is the Year of the Ox. I hope that our 400 million compatriots will use the strength of an ox to pull our China into the realm of modern countries.</p>

<p>Old moral concepts are, of course, the shackles of ethics and morality, but the so-called "new" men and women must pay close attention to the worship of new morality; otherwise, they will give superficial fashionists a path of only suicide!</p>
<p>So-called love is the cooperation of spirit and body, not limited to the physical. All people in the world have a conscience and reason. Once this conscience and reason has traces of sin, once it is stained with ugly blemishes, then any physical enjoyment will not be considered true love.</p>
<p>But there are very few people in the world with such strong reason, right?</p>

<h3>The Four Leads of "Borrowing a Wife"</h3>
<p>— Nanjing Ying</p>
<h3>Paris Screens "Little Miss Marker"</h3>
<p>"Little Miss Marker" Shirley Temple, tired of a rich life and eager for freedom and fun, the plot is lighthearted, and the performance is wonderful. Undoubtedly, it is Shirley's most proud new work, which is indeed unmatched by any of her previous leading roles. The Paris Cinema on Avenue Joffre is using this film to celebrate the New Year. To avoid crowding, an additional show will be screened every morning at 10:30 AM from New Year's Day for three days.</p>
<h3>Amateur Thespians in the New Year</h3>
<p>Performing at the Carlton in mid-January</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Amateur Drama Association decided on the program for its third public performance, "The Power of Darkness" (original by Tolstoy, adapted by Ouyang Yuqian), Ostrovsky's "The Storm," and O'Casey's "The Plough and the Stars" (adapted by Shen Xiling and Song Yizhou), it has been actively rehearsing for more than a month. It has now been decided by the conference to hold a public performance at the Carlton Grand Theater in mid-January.</p>
<p>Most of the people participating in the amateur drama performance are directors and actors from various film companies. They are usually tied down by their duties and often cannot have enough time to work together. Now that the New Year holiday is approaching, they have decided to use this holiday to actively step up rehearsals. In addition to daily rehearsals, they will hold parties to increase interest.</p>

<h3>Hunting in Wenchuan</h3>
<p>The famous hunter Yang Dilin, brother of the explorer Yang Dize, studied in the Americas and has been deep into the northeast, southeast, and other parts of Xikang many times, hunting many rare birds and strange animals. In late August of this year, he went from Shanghai to Chongqing, passing through Chengdu to Caopo in Wenchuan County. The area is full of mountains, about 7,000 feet above sea level. The purpose of this trip was to hunt the world-famous white bear. This white bear is different from the Arctic white bear, about three feet high and more than four feet long. The fur is black and white, and bamboo leaves, bamboo stalks, and bamboo shoots are its daily food. It is only produced in the border area of ​​Sichuan and Kang in my country, which is very precious. The local aborigines say that it can eat steel and respect it as a sacred beast, and dare not harm it, so it multiplies very well. In fact, the theory of eating iron is completely a false rumor. Mr. Yang harvested two heads on this trip, one of which was given to the Academia Sinica, and the other was made into a specimen and stored in his home. It is said that each head is worth about 2,000 US dollars.</p>
