<h3>昨整日全綫砲戰激烈敵猛犯羅店劉處遭重創</h3>
<p>劉行村落間敵兵均被我殲滅　閘北八字僑一帶昨不斷激戰　江灣我軍採取攻勢予敵打擊　市中心敵軍有後撤模樣</p>
<p>連日敵以生力部隊、藉飛機大砲坦克車之掩護、圖突破我全綫一點、切斷我連絡、羅店劉行間戰事尤烈、我軍浴血應戰、迎頭痛擊、敵傷亡奇重、終不能越雷池一步、其第四次總攻、顯已受初步之嚴重打擊矣、蓋自極左翼之瀏河、以至極右翼之八字橋北站我軍陣線、防禦工事旣異常鞏固、配備兵力、又十分雄厚、絕無一較弱之點、可予敵軍以進犯之機會也、昨日自拂曉起以迄深晚、雙方幾以炮戰爲主體、敵數百門重砲、益以敵艦砲火、向我全綫作密集之轟擊、圖先毀滅我防禦工事、然後派大部隊伍進犯、我忠勇前線將士、伏處散壕、靜待殺敵、絕對未受絲毫威脅、同時我重炮隊亦予還擊、一晝夜間敵所發砲彈、至少當在數千發、而其所得之代價、乃幾等於零也、閘北方面、澈宵機槍步搶小鋼炮聲不絕、八字橋方面激戰甚烈、截至今晨三時止、我羅店·劉行·江灣·閘北陣線、兀然不動、</p>
<p>敵軍昨日向江灣發砲轟擊、漫無標的、我陣地毫未損毀、同時市中心區敵軍、以形勢突出、恐被我包圍、有向後撤退模樣、</p>
<h3>敵四次總攻開始全力犯羅店劉行</h3>
<p>雙方展開猛烈砲戰　各路來侵均未得手</p>
<p>所謂敵軍第四次之總攻開始後、昨前兩日、全綫完全入於猛烈砲戰之中、自最西北之瀏河起、經羅店·劉行·大塲·江灣·以至閘北八字橋、無處不有敵軍密集之砲火、約略統計、昨日竟日、敵軍所發之砲當在三千發以上、其目的卽希冀在我軍全綫陣地中、尋覓一弱點、企圖衝入、其步兵則匿居後方、怯不敢進、至我軍陣地、堅固異常、不爲所動、同時我軍砲隊、並不示弱、亦立予還擊、於是雙方展開空前猛烈之砲戰、直至今晨、砲聲尚未息、</p>
<p>敵軍大舉　進犯劉行</p>
<p>昨日淸晨、敵軍在砲火掩護之下、以坦克車爲前導、企圖侵入滬太公路之東羅店劉行中間西錢宅我軍之陣地、我軍沉着應戰、見其進西王宅將近我軍警戒綫時、砲隊立卽一齊發動、瞄準敵軍猛轟、敵車兩輛、當卽被毀於我軍所置之鐵絲網中、其餘數輛、亦受損甚重、全隊遂被迫後退、</p>
<p>中央社云、自劉行方面大舉進犯之敵軍、經我兩日來血戰痛擊、已完全敗退、敵軍於二十九日下午起、以重砲向我太平橋張家弄之綫猛烈轟擊、繼以戰車二十餘輛、引導步兵二千餘人、向我周家巷西王宅唐家浜陳巷附近進犯、我軍沉着應戰、嚴密戒備、敵軍一部、進至張家弄之東公路上、與我軍陣地相距僅一百公尺、同時敵軍千餘人、向北移動、企圖從殷家角附近渡河、我軍俟敵迫近、衝出猛擊、與敵肉搏、喊殺之聲、震動四野、敵軍陣綫大亂、倉遽潰退、</p>
<p>陶宅頑敵　終於潰退</p>
<p>敵軍希圖突破我羅店至劉行一叚警戒綫、先於前日以大砲猛轟整日後、至昨日拂曉、卽猛烈進攻、當時敵軍兩中隊、導以坦克車三十輛、由楊宅金家宅敵軍陣地出動、越滬太公路、向羅店南約三百公尺處之陶家宅·周家宅·及塘灣一綫猛衝、來勢異常兇狠、惟該地阡陌連綿、溝渠縱橫、故行動呆滯、經我軍以迫擊砲猛擊、其後隨步兵、更胆怯不前、如此相持至午、終爲我擊退、</p>
<p>小隊敵兵　悉遭殲滅</p>
<p>昨晨三時許、楊行方面之敵、約二百餘人、向我劉行附近江家宅·汪家宅·陣地進襲、並先以步兵十餘人爬行至我陣地附近、我軍雖早已偵悉、但佯作不知、待其餘之敵後隨衝到時、我軍乃齊從戰壕內躍出猛搏、當先將十餘爬行之敵、悉數擊斃、後更乘勢衝殺、敵倉皇棄械逃回、我軍共獲步槍百餘枝、</p>
<p>顧家宅鎭　砲火猛密</p>
<p>前日下午、楊行附近之敵砲兵陣地、向我顧家宅鎭等處猛烈轟炸、附近民房着彈起火者甚多、砲聲綿亘達五小時以上、至昨晨猶未稍止、同時大隊敵機、在沿灑太公路濫施轟炸、大塲鎭落彈數十枚、民房被燬十餘間、前晚在蕰藻浜北岸、周宅方面、有敵約二中隊、企圖活動、被我警戒綫軍隊、予以嚴密監視、並以重砲轟擊、敵軍未能越動一步、昨晨有敵機十餘架、又在該處附近轟炸、現我軍在該處佈置極固工事、敵方萬難進窺、</p>
<p>敵軍砲轟　大塲江灣</p>
<p>殷行上海公墓西北敵軍砲兵陣地、昨晨連續發砲、向我大場江灣一帶轟擊、我軍散據各要點、防敵進犯、伏處甚久、未見敵兵影蹤、經哨兵探悉、南徐家匯一帶、有大隊敵軍、向寶山方面移動、似向月浦方面增加兵力、以猛攻我劉行以北之綫、而所發大砲、則爲掩護其軍隊之調動云、</p>
<p>施相公廟　兩度激戰</p>
<p>羅店方面、自二十九日晨起發生激戰、敵以戰車十餘輛掩護步兵八百餘人、向我施相公廟附近陣地進犯、我軍以機槍及手溜彈向敵迎擊、激戰至晚、敵軍不支潰退、遺屍甚多、昨晨拂曉、敵又重整旗鼓、再度進犯、我軍沉着應戰、激戰至深夜、敵已呈不支模樣、</p>
<h3>閘北八字橋一帶昨全日不斷激戰</h3>
<p>愛國女校　敵被逐出</p>
<p>昨午三時起、敵又以大砲及飛機、向我八字橋水電路江灣車站高境廟車站一帶猛烈轟炸、發砲達四五百枚之多、目的在破壞我方工事、並窺察我弱點、乘勢進犯、我軍除嚴密戒備外、並改取攻勢、將盤踞愛國女校之敵完全逐出、我軍於達到任務後、仍退回原防、該校現在我警戒範圍中、</p>
<p>犯八字橋　我敵激戰</p>
<p>昨日下午六時左右、六三花園及白本墳墓方面有敵陸戰隊約二中隊籍坦克車掩護、向八字橋進窺、方家木橋方面、我軍堅忍據守、阻敵前進、同時由粤東中學調派奇兵、由廣中路殺出、向六三花園側面猛攻、與進犯敵軍遭遇、發生激戰、敵慌亂中傷亡廿餘、乃列戰車爲陣、與我對壘、迄深夜尚相持中、機槍與步槍同射、聲如連珠、震動全市、</p>
<p>敵軍肆意　轟炸閘北</p>
<p>市中心區之敵、向我閘北方面不斷砲擊、敵機亦在寶山路商務印書館廢址連日轟炸後、以爲我方工事已被破壞、故於前夜十一時、又有敵兵數十、分乘小艇三艘、沿橫浜河北駛、圖在寶山路方面登陸進犯、惟經我機關槍掃射後、知我有備、卽行逃去、數分鐘後、敵砲又開始轟擊、至昨晨拂曉時尤爲猛烈、敵機亦參加肆意轟炸、惟我工事未有損毀、據駐軍長官表示、該處陣地鞏固、守一年半載、絕無問題、</p>
<h3>江灣我軍進攻殲敵</h3>
<p>敵犯我警戒綫被痛擊</p>
<p>江灣我軍、採取攻勢、前晚八時我由賀家巷陣地派兵一部、向泗涇球塲敵軍進玫、敵負嵎頑抗、激戰終夜我另有一部抄敵後路、在翔殷路江灣跑馬廳之東、將敵三十餘名包圍、敵雖頑强、終被我全部殲滅、至昨晨一時我軍始退原防、旋復旦大學之北村舍三處起火、至午尚在延燒中、</p>
<p>昨日午後、敵以軍艦大砲·坦克車小砲及機關槍·三種火力、向復旦大學以北我警戒綫轟擊、企圖壓迫我前哨後退、我軍沈着應戰、靜伏防禦物後、伺敵步兵逼近我陣地時、卽以機關槍與哨兵聯合迎擊至晚七時半、敵以傷亡甚多、卽以坦克車掩護向後退去、我對該段戰略、决取先發制人之策、不待敵人進犯、卽乘機進攻、以鞏固我警戒綫、</p>
<h3>廟行敵便衣隊解决</h3>
<p>敵軍少數便衣隊、喬裝難民模樣、越過蕰藻浜、侵入我軍廟行陣地後方、進至無名英雄墓附近、、企圖擾亂我軍後方、在大場東北、被我軍發現、立起加以包圍、爲數不多、當卽全部解决、至昨日午刻、該項便衣隊、已告完全肅淸、</p>
<h3>敵謀浦東始終不逞</h3>
<p>停泊陸家嘴浦面之敵小火輪及舢板三艘、現僅留舢板一艘、兩小火輪已駛離他處、且靠春江碼頭陸家嘴浦面附近之岸邊、敵軍偸搬三塊大橡皮板斜倚岸邊地上、似係用以窺探我浦東情形及竊聽砲聲、至舢板想係預備逃避之用、</p>
<p>浦東陸家嘴英商祥生鐵廠、因員工星散、以致敵兵於最近竟敢兩度在該處登陸、窺探我方軍情、前晚忽有一敵方小輪、駛近該碼頭外擋、當被我軍擊沉於離碼頭五尺之浦中、烟囱與老大間、尚透露水面、</p>
<h3>敵軍續到五千餘人</h3>
<p>昨日午後、浦江又續到敵大號運輸艦四艘、載來敵軍五千餘人、及馬匹甚多、分泊大阪及黃浦碼頭、又午前停泊大阪碼頭之敵運輸艦兩艘及匯山碼頭招商局北棧之敵運輸艦各一艘、將軍用品木頭鉛皮等卸下後、已駛離浦江、</p>
<h3>敵艦續運軍需到滬</h3>
<p>昨日進浦之八敵運輸艦、除招商北棧尚泊有一艘外、餘均駛離浦江、前夜及昨晨（三十日）又續到敵運輸艦四艘、分泊招商北棧匯山及大阪碼頭、該四艦之敵兵多忙於搬運艦上大量鉛皮木頭及軍用品、移至大阪及黃浦碼頭、且停泊新三井煤棧之敵砲艦、自昨日午後離浦後、現又泊靠舊地、竊取該煤棧大量煤塊、私運至該艦、</p>
<h3>法人在虹口遭慘殺</h3>
<p>法國人“巴門、”前在虹口楡林路某羅宋酒吧間爲職員、自“八一三戰事發生後、虹口交通斷絕、巴門未及逃出、其親友四出查訪而不獲、遂以失踪事實報告法捕房在案、至昨日始由工部局捕頭發現“巴門”之屍身於昆明路某弄內、屍已腐爛、遍體槍傷、不知因何獲罪於日軍、而遭此慘殺、昨已將該案移交法捕房究辦矣、</p>
<h3>敵機又轟炸救護車</h3>
<p>四川同鄕會抗戰後援會戰時服務團救護隊、每日出發前綫、救護受傷抗戰將士、異常奮勇、昨日午前十二時許、行經眞南路洛陽橋附近、有敵機三架、圖施轟炸、投彈十餘枚、均落車前車後、未能擲中、敵機見目的未達、當低飛用機關槍掃射、致救護車受損、司機員李子淸受重傷、隊長田振夫·及文化界救亡恊會慰勞主任黃一然·救亡日報記者彭啟一·曁隊員金人·等五人均受輕傷、</p>
<h3>羅店坿近戰區形勢圖</h3>
<h3>師直爲壯曲爲老敵兵莫不厭戰</h3>
<p>對我優待均感激涕零</p>
<p>昨日國民社記者晤煤業救護隊隊長羅德傳、據談、本月二十六日晚、我軍俘獲敵軍小隊長一名士兵一名、據該敵兵云、自十九日進吳淞口、二十日登陸、廿一日赴前綫加入作戰、二十六日受傷、此次來滬作戰、事前未知、祇知來滬接防、自加入作戰、因給養不足、六日未得進食、家中尚有年老父母、該兵並稱、加入軍隊已一年十個月、再多二月、卽可脫離軍籍、此係我自己之不幸、我是不願來滬作戰的、卽全體在華作戰日兵、亦莫不厭戰、該敵傷兵擬致函日本家中父母、報告日機在中國非戰門區及救護隊傷兵醫院等轟炸、此種情形、不顧人道、完全政府之錯誤、望卽轉知政府、我現被俘非常優待、請放心云云、</p>
<h3>敵全力攻淞滬傷亡慘重已陷於苦戰狀態</h3>
<p>精銳部隊經我軍迭次殲滅　敵步兵之弱點已暴露無遺　我長官表示死守淞滬</p>
<p>淞滬全綫、連日均有激戰、陣地之有進出、與一時之得失、固無關大局、本報記者於昨日在某處得晤因公來滬之高級指揮官某氏、暢論最近軍事情形、談話結果、以果斷之態度、告記者曰、“吾人奉令保衞上海、則必死守閘北、浦東南市、均與全局有關、自當盡力捍衞”、繼謂、自開戰以來、敵軍屢次增援總數已達七八師團之衆、約十五萬人、雖集其主力、屢圖一逞、但我軍實力雄厚、陣地鞏固、迄未授以罅隙、反屢將敵精銳消耗、使其傷亡慘重、時時陷於苦戰狀態中、連日敵以我軍深溝高壘、步兵無所施展、乃改用飛機大砲轟炸、如永安橋東某公墓敵砲兵陣地、向我沿蕰藻浜之胡家宅·小朱宅·及顧家宅·劉行·一帶轟炸、自昨日（二十九日）晨五時起、至今晨七時止、聯續發砲、竟達二千餘發之多、但我方僅死傷士兵二十餘人、而我軍陣地、仍屹然未動、實已計窮力竭、昨日（二十九）敵曾以一連之衆、在飛機大砲掩護之下、由靶子路中州路犯我寶山路一帶、迄今午（三十日）猶在激戰中、又楊行方面敵砲、今午（三十日）又開始轟擊、同時在羅店北面敵之主力、正圖突破羅店至曹王廟施相公廟之綫、企圖、以迂迴側擊之策、拊江灣閘北我軍之背然、我軍早已洞燭其奸、誓必予以痛擊也、就五旬以來之戰事經驗、及我軍兼旬扼守第一道防綫之事實言、敵軍步兵、始終未能進展、卽一村莊、亦未被其衝破、敵之作戰能力、已如黔驢之技、不過爾爾、卽飛機重砲、亦僅能對無準備之區域肆虐、現我軍已有充分之準傭、敵軍無論如何、决難得逞、此可告慰於全滬人士、亦可告慰於全國同胞者也、</p>
<h3>楊家村一役証明敵已無鬭志</h3>
<p>檢得敵武田軍曹日記一册　指我軍神武敵則戰爭困難　兩聯隊幾完全殲滅</p>
<p>我軍部發表、本月二十六日楊家村之役、（在羅店西北）敵以重籐支隊所屬高橋佐籐兩聯隊進犯、經我軍奮勇截擊、敵軍幾完全殲滅、而在桃宅被我包圍之第一·第四·第八·三中隊、狼竄豕突、被俘多人、得逃生者僅三人、我收復該村時、敵軍重要文件印鑑均置案上、槍彈遺棄、滿路皆是、其狼狽之情形、可以想見、又據由該處逃生之難民目覩敵中級軍官傷三員死一員、經我獲得馬靴一雙、爲中山少佐之物、益可證明其慘敗情形、重要文件業已呈報、另搜獲敵武田軍曹之日記一册、大意如下、㊀敵（日軍）忙於警戒、睡眠不足、㊁懼我夜襲、澈夜不敢熟睡、㊂我軍抗戰力意外堅强、且攻擊巧妙、迫擊砲聲驚心動魄、㊃敵數次斷糧、僅賴餅干麵包、且最近麵包烟草均感缺乏、已覺戰爭之困苦、次第加重㊄思家心切、嫌惡戰爭、</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>國際響應與抗戰前途</h3>
<p>— 鄒韜奮</p>
<p>國聯大會於九月二十八日通過二十三國諮詢委員會所提出的决議案，譴責日本空軍轟炸中國都市殘殺平民，贊成者達五十二國。大會主席阿加汗宣佈决議案通過時，全塲掌聲雷動，情形熱烈，得未曾有。當諮詢委員會開會時，各國代表都有激昂慷慨的陳詞·英代表克蘭波表示，這種慘酷的轟炸新聞，全文明世界聽到之後的深切的悲憤，非言語所能形容。法代表台爾博斯也起來聲稱，凡是看到廣州南京漢口等地被轟炸的報吿的人，沒有不悲憤填膺的，若再緘默無言，卽等於與罪犯爲同謀。倘今日世界的良心不起而大聲疾呼，則文明本身將有滅絕之虞。蘇聯代表李維諾夫於擁護克蘭波對於空中轟炸的譴責之外，並進一步聲明，對於空中的譴責，並非對於其他進攻中國的方法卽可認為正當。向在模稜動搖中的美國當局也表示贊同國聯的譴責日本，謂國聯如有具體的建議，則美國務院將加以審愼的考盧：同時聲明美政府曾屢次向日政府聲明，日飛機漫無限制，在中國人民稠密的廣大區域任意轟炸平民，實不正當而違反法律與人道原則。</p>
<p>國際輿論與民衆對日本的暴行更表示義憤。倫敦泰晤士報在社論中直率痛斥暴日的無恥，世界輿論一致抨擊，英報且鼓吹實行經濟制裁。英國人民抵制日貨運動發展迅速，已普及全國，美國也在發動，紐西蘭及南洋各地都在開始這種運動。印度國民黨領袖尼赫魯也發起在加爾各答，孟買，麻打拉斯，仰光四城舉行民衆大會，提出印度民衆實行抵制日貨的决議案。國際充滿了憤恨日本的空氣，已是鐵一般的事實了。</p>
<p>日本是素以善宣傳聞於世的。聽說他們對於宣傳費，是和軍費一樣重視的。但是無論他們的無恥的代言人怎樣善於厚顏說謊，最近屠殺中國平民的殘酷獸行，仍然要激動世界的公憤，而做這殘酷獸行的犧牲品的却是中國的死得慘痛絕倫的無數平民。暴日的目的是要以極殘酷的屠殺手段，恫嚇中國人民，根據他們自己亳無人格亳無國格的無恥想像，以為這樣可以使中國人嚇倒，由此可以達到他們所夢想的使中國“屈膝”。但是出乎他們意料之外的，是中國人民雖然遭受到人世間最慘痛的境遇，前仆後繼，斷頭絕臂，為國難而死，死而無悔，民衆始終所有的唯一心理是抗戰到底，必打到我們的强盜驅出國門，收回失地，恢復主權，才肯罷休。西班牙外長伐育在這次國聯大會中熱烈擁護該會譴責日本暴行的决議，宣稱“西班牙謹向中國偉大民族的團結一致，表示熱烈的同情。”我以為中國不怕為國難而慘死的平民，他們的精神的偉大，實在是中國偉大民族精神的表現，而不是以屠殺作恫嚇手段的人們（？）所能想像得到的。徒然受人屠殺，只能引起人的憐憫而不能引起人的敬意。雖遭受到至慘極酷的轟炸獸行的屠殺而猶能前仆後繼，繼續擁護抗戰到底，繼續參加抗戰到底，這樣才能引起人的敬意。</p>
<p>“日本無論在平時或在戰時，終將仰賴世界以圖存。”（倫敦泰晤士報的話）日本要靠國外的原料，耍靠國外的市塲，日本要想脫離世界而橫行霸道以圖存，實是不可想像的事情。侵略我國的日本已遭世界的一致唾棄，我們的敵人在國際上的孤立，同時就是我們的勝利，也就是對於我國的抗戰前途有着良好的影響。要保持這個良好的影響，要擴大這個良好的影響，要使這個良好的影響更現實化，更具體化，固然在外交上的運用，而尤其根本的還是在我們自己能不辱“中國偉大民族”的精神，在艱苦中把抗戰持續下去，國聯這次對於暴日獸行的嚴厲譴責，各國輿論和民衆的熱烈的同情，是我們的無數慘死同胞的血肉肝腦掉換而來的；是我們的無數同胞為國難而死的偉大精神掉換而來的。天下沒有不出代價的好結果。我們要爭取國際上更大的協助，必須有更大的代價；這更大的代價便是我們要從種種方面努力，使我們的抗戰能夠堅持下去。</p>
<p>國際響應誠然於我們抗戰前途是有利的。但是我們不要忽略它的來源，不要忘却它的來源。必須把握住這一點，然後我們對於最近的國際響應與抗戰前途，才能獲得正確的認識與更進一步的努力。</p>

<h3>俄國防新次長</h3>
<p>［莫斯科］蘇聯中執會任命紅軍政治都主任斯米爾諾失、爲人民國防委員會副委員長、（三十日塔期電）</p>
<p>時評</p>
<h3>戰局瞻望</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>這幾天來。南北戰事都極劇烈。淞滬敵軍迭次用最新銳的機械化部隊全力進攻。而我軍防綫始終屹然不動。我們的防禦力量是天天加强的。今後敵軍攻勢只有愈趨不利。因此在這方面的前綫我們卽使不反守爲攻。單以相持的局勢。來消耗敵人的力量。也就够他們受的了。</p>
<p>北方戰局。似乎更吃緊些。敵軍自從侵佔大同以後。雖然遭遇了晋綏我軍劇烈的抵抗。而在平型關一役。尤其受到非常重大的損失。但這幾天來正在竭力擴充察熱交通綫。沿平綏綫大量增兵晋綏前途的確還很可慮。而且滄保綫我軍主力也因戰略關係。稍稍南移。就表面看來。敵人併吞華北的陣勢是逐漸開展了。</p>
<p>然而北方戰事表面上的惡化。大半郤種因於過去政治上的缺陷。這種缺陷隨着抗戰的進程。正在逐漸地消滅下去。戰局從黯淡而轉向光明是必然的。現在我們固然不能不悲痛我們的村鎭一一的遭受了敵騎的蹂躪。但我們絕對的無須沮喪。因為在持久的焦土抗戰的情勢之下。敵人任何凶猛的侵略手段。到頭總要粉碎的。</p>
<h3>消弭遠東危機美國正式表示願與各國密切合作</h3>
<p>國聯任何和平建議均願予以考慮　會議應不以九國公約簽字國為限</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國務部今日向美聯社記者確切表示、美國認為遠東之危機、為世界各國之共同問題、並不限於九國公約之簽字國家、或與太平洋直接有關之國家而已、因此美國對於遠東問題、已擴大眼光、而同時對於召集九國公約或太平洋國家會議等等建議、似稍冷淡、目前美國尚未正式接得此項建議、故亦無所决定、惟已明白表示、不願以此種促進和平之努力、僅限於有數國家之範圍以內云、</p>
<p>國務部官員又請記者注意八月廿三日國務卿和平宣言中所列如下之聲述、卽“今世界各處旣隨處有和平威脅及嚴重衝突之存在、則此項問題自應為世界各國所共同關切、”當時世界各國對於此項宣言之一致贊助、足見世界輿情對於中日衝突態度之一斑、最近國聯五十二國一致斥責日本轟炸中國平民之暴行、又與美國之態度不約而同、又美國向日本提出關於此項暴行之抗議、指摘其為人道所不容、亦較各國為先、最後、於國聯斥責日本此項暴行之後、赫爾又曾表示美國政府贊許之意、</p>
<p>此外國務部訓令美代表哈理遜列席國聯諮詢委員會一舉、更可顯示美國凖備參加减輕世界危機之國際合作行動、關於國際諮詢委員會之活動、美國對於國聯曾有如下之進言、卽“美政府確信世界各國合作之原則、並願設法促使國際衝突之和平解决、國聯若有確切之建議提供美國、則美國極願為愼重之考盧、唯對於假定式之探詢、則美國未便立卽說明其政策上計劃上之地位”、總之、美國對於國聯所發之通知、乃極為友好、就合作一點言、實為美國對國聯所發質言之破天荒、至於九國公約、國務部官員聲稱、對於此約之簽字國雖曾略有非正式之諮詢、但今日並無有何動作、且該約並未規定有採取任何行動之議會、因此美國認為和平應於此約以外求之、始得其宜、（廿九日國民電）</p>

<p>戰時青年</p>
<h3>發刊辭</h3>
<p>— 鳴時</p>
<p>自淞滬抗戰以還，瞬將五旬，乃暴敵之兇燄猶熾，初無悔過之心；他日縱不免蹈自焚之危，而吾人今日之仔肩未可輕卸。蓋際茲抗戰期中，應集中力量，作禦侮圖存之計，匹夫匹婦，皆當“力惡其不出於己”，以盡國民之天責。靑年人年力正富，寄重干城，尤當充足實力，爲長期抗戰之凖備。於是戰時常識之探討，技能之訓練，品格之修養，熱情之激發，在在有注意之必要；非若是，不足爲現代之中國靑年也。</p>
<p>本團循此宗旨，除集合二千餘靑年男女童軍盡力於戰時服務工作外，思賈其餘勇籍與全國靑年相砥礪，使充實知能，以完成凖備之使命；然後發揮其偉大之力量，共赴國難，蕩彼倭虜，復興民族，願我同志共勉之。</p>
<p>今後，尤希海內先進，各界賢達，時錫南鍼，以匡不逮，則民族前途，庶有豸乎。</p>
<h3>犧牲與抗戰</h3>
<p>— 中銓</p>
<p>在紀念“九一八”六週年的那天正午，我曾很恭敬的立正過，聽命無綫電的發號施令；我曾很嚴肅的靜默過，追憶已往許多血淚的創傷；我也曾很悲壯的高喊過，嗥出了“犧牲到底，抗戰到底”！這最末的兩句誓詞。我深信，這二句誓詞，是我們扺抗日帝國主義侵略的唯一秘訣，也就是我們爭取最後勝利的必備條件。</p>
<p>“抗戰”是爭取生存的方法，“犧牲”是“抗戰”最需要的資本；有了方法，有了資本，還得要有决心；這三個條件全具備了，那勝利的必操左券，當然是毫無問題的了。</p>
<p>中國軍民，在今日國家存亡與民族興衰的緊要關頭，非但要不怕犧牲，還得要凖備犧牲。這裹我們願重新引用一下蔣委員長的話：“全國國民，最要認淸所謂最後關頭的意義。最後關頭一到，我們只有犧牲到底，抗戰到底。唯有犧牲到底的决心，才能博得最後的勝利”。</p>
<h3>戰時靑年</h3>
<p>— 元生</p>
<p>誰都承認，靑年是一個國家最有希望的人，也就是國家命脈之所繫。歷史告訴我們，德國的强盛，日本的復興，是都由靑年力量所造成的，換句話說，這完全是靑年偉大的特殊的功績。</p>
<p>戰時靑年之與國家，其關係當然更覺密切。世界大戰時，德國曾動員大批的靑年，在前後方工作，他們服務的精神，的確要使我們感嘆！雖然，大戰的結果，德國是吃了敗仗，但一般靑年的精神，却並沒有失敗，依舊是一般的奮發，所以直到今日，德國還是一個赫赫有名的强國。</p>
<p>自“八一三”滬戰爆發後，上海市的一部份靑年，就成立了許多救亡團體，做着各種戰時靑年應做的工作。但事實擺在眼前的，我們的工作，根本還不夠，反正，我們的力量是非常的單薄。</p>
<p>從今日起，我們是要更大的動員中國的靑年，來做戰時的工作；從今日起，我們是要更大的集中我們的力量，來貢獻給國家。同時，我們還得注意，做一個戰時的靑年，不單是憑空說說就了事的；我們要切切實實的去做實際工作，這才是戰時靑年眞正精神的表顯！</p>
<h3>一個砲聲</h3>
<p>— 勞漁</p>
<p>給一個砲聲打醒了，卽從床上爬起來，這時，掛錶告訴我正是五點零五分。</p>
<p>光亮由黑暗圈裹，慢慢的推開，太陽從雲端裹漸漸的吐出；天空披上魚肚的色彩，正象徵着一個朝氣蓬勃精神奮發的有爲靑年。</p>
<p>踏進辦公室，就見到八九個女童軍，很努力的在做着一件偉大的工作，——替前綫戰土縫製棉背心——我看她們，裁布的裁布，舖花的舖花，縫製的縫製，工作是異常緊張</p>
<p>從一個砲聲，陡想起這幾個女童軍的工作，我的心裏，是會掀起何等的感想啊？</p>
<p>前綫戰士，在寒風中，奮勇殺敵，後方民衆，正爲他們趕製寒衣，這裏相互的精神，是會使我們抗敵的力量，更大，更强，更鞏固！</p>

<h3>敵傾全力總攻我軍陣地固若金湯</h3>

<p>中央社云、江灣方面昨日至今日上午未有激烈戰事、敵之大砲、不時向我陣地發射轟炸、似在試測我方動靜、僅在江灣跑馬廳一帶發生前哨戰、雙方陣地絕無變動、</p>

<p>敵軍自九月二十八日起實行第四次總攻後、曾集其所有精銳、向我全綫進攻、而尤以羅店劉行一綫爲最、似欲希冀突破我軍中心綫、以達威脅我軍後方、但連日來經我忠勇將士痛擊後、敵軍非但未有絲毫轉機、反而節節挫敗、喪失慘重、雖敵砲密如雨下、終不能稍挫我鋒、敵爲顧慮實力、避免我軍正面鋒銳計、乃亟亟改採游擊戰略、曾於二十八日晚起、在敵方千餘發砲轟之後、以若干大隊、循窮鄕僻徑向羅店東南北三面進犯、當時我軍立卽接戰、交綏未幾、敵卽潰却、我軍卽乘勝推進、足達五里之遙、但至二十九日黎明時、敵軍在其飛機大砲掩護之下、又以一團之衆、向我軍新據陣地來攻、而又側重於劉行東南一路、當時我扼守該處中興宅之部隊、於探悉其實力後、卽分兵一部、銜枚疾走、進抵□□處、超達敵軍後方、以作我正面軍之響應、然敵軍固始終不知業已中伏、仍前進如故、我軍見其將近、乃一聲號令、躍出戰壕、紛以輕重武器向敵猛擊、但敵頑强死抗、仍團前進、斯時、我伏兵齊起、四面圍來、敵軍始知中伏、已屬不及撤退、當被我軍殲滅殆盡、死傷遍野、不過四百餘名、並截獲敵軍用品甚多、入晚、敵軍再以機械化部隊向中興宅來攻、其砲火亦集中向該處轟擊、前由我□□砲兵陣地予以猛烈之還擊、同時抽調我迫擊砲隊、以及機關槍隊等先頭迎擊、激戰至午夜、敵以傷亡過重、遂行潰退、我方亦稍有損傷、待至三十日上午十一時、敵軍捲土重來、仍被我軍擊退、不謂敵軍竟爾違背國際公法、以達姆彈供其前綫、致我軍曾有數名遭害、但其戰術與精神、究難與我抗衡　經我奮勇進擊之下、仍是不支潰退、嗣卽不敢復犯、</p>
<h3>敵艦砲位移向浦東</h3>
<p>似有大舉侵犯浦東模樣</p>
<p>本報特訊、據探報、浦江敵艦、所有砲位、今日均移向浦東瞄準、又最近數日來、下游江面、敵軍運到木筏及小汽艇甚多、似有大擧進犯浦東模樣、</p>
<h3>蕰藻浜僞軍供前驅</h3>
<p>蕰藻浜之敵、沿北岸西進、日前已抵胡宅周宅一帶、構築工事、而部隊調動異常忙碌、並多着灰色制服之僞滿軍、被敵調徵前來、供其驅策、胡宅周宅南距廟行約二公里許、敵發動全綫總攻擊、該處亦爲其目標之一、故在胡宅附近配置重砲三四門、迭向我陣地轟擊、但多落田野、並未炸發、我軍檢獲其砲彈上鑄有“中華民國十一年奉天造”之字樣、蓋係“九一八”時在東三省所盜竊而去者、今竟運來應用、言之殊堪痛心、至該處敵軍又伏於北岸、頻以機槍掃射、希圖壓迫我軍後退、渡河進犯、但我軍憑河固守、敵始終無偷渡之機會、</p>
<h3>敵援軍已完全到滬</h3>
<p>總計一師團及一旅團共四萬人</p>
<p>敵第四次增援軍一師團及一旅團、合約四萬餘人、連日來已陸續開抵上海者、總數已達三萬五千人左右、且已於前日（二十八日）起開始作第四次總攻、今晨七時至八時、又續有敵商輪改建之第五二號運輸艦生島丸、第一三六號運輸艦海平丸、第四六號運輸艦明石丸、第二六六號運輸艦善洋丸、第二六二號運輸艦泰安丸、第一七零號運輸艦總洋丸等共六艘、相繼駛滬、分別停靠大阪黃浦匯山三碼頭、當又有敵第四次增援軍之最後一批約六千餘人登陸云、</p>
<h3>我高級官視察閘北</h3>
<p>防務鞏固極爲滿意</p>
<p>日來敵迭次向我閘北方面用猛烈砲火進犯、我軍忠勇抗戰、敵終不得逞、我高級將領特於昨日親往該綫視察防務、幷撫慰前方將士、對我軍所築鞏固陳地、頗爲滿意、對該綫指揮官亦倍加嘉獎、敵雖頑强、迭圖猛攻、終歸失敗、當屬意料中、</p>
<h3>松井大將黔驢技窮</h3>
<p>除督師外兼有政治活動　到處碰壁無所施其伎倆</p>
<p>另息、此次日政府派松井來滬督師、不僅純粹爲軍事關係、幷且連帶一種政治性質、因松井在滬頗多熟悉之友人也、但到滬以後、四處電話約談、終無應者、則黔驢伎倆、亦無從發展矣、</p>
<h3>日派外交人員來滬</h3>
<p>進行聯絡上海各國使領　運用外交力量別有企圖</p>
<p>本報特訊、記者今向外交界探悉、日本外務省、因鑒於外交上陷於孤立地位、特派在野外交家、（更在歐美各國任職之外交大員）曁中國通、共有十餘人、特任佐藤爲隊長、已定於本月三日、乘日輪上海丸出發來滬、進行聯絡上海各國使領、並擬與中國各界領袖周旋、運用外交力量、別有企圖、</p>
<p>中央社云、暴日橫行、輿論譁然、敵獨執迷不悟、一意孤行、前經擬派人民使節赴歐美各國、冀圖文飾詭辯、近聞又遴選在野歐美外交家及所謂“中國通”來滬、由有名佐藤者率領、日內卽可抵滬、聞抵滬後、將向歐美各國在滬領袖、有所活動、但事實具在、想歐美人士當不爲所惑云、</p>

<h3>長谷川無理要求各國軍艦移泊</h3>
<p>企圖佔領南市有礙軍事行動　當經各國海軍當局嚴詞拒絕　在任何危險狀態下决不離防</p>
<p>據某方確息、敵軍目前積極企圖佔領南市、但因浦江上游（卽特區浦面）泊有各國軍艦頗多、有礙軍事進行、未便貿然登陸、故敵軍第三艦隊司令長谷川、特於前日（二十九日）上午十時許、派遣海軍武官武田·參謀尾田·兩代表、乘汽艇至新開河江面分訪英·美·法·義·德·荷·等六國海軍司令、要求各該國軍艦於二十四小時內、移泊浦江下游、以便日軍進攻南市、但當時各國海軍當局、立卽嚴詞拒絕、並一致表示爲保護各本國僑民及特區治安計、在任何危險狀態之下、决不離開原防、惟聞有某某三國海軍司令、曾於當日下午五時、一度召集會議答復辦法、詳情未悉、</p>

<h3>日對美復文美覺失望</h3>
<p>［華盛頓］美國前因日飛機濫轟中國非戰鬥員向日政府提出抗議、日政府覆文並未含有特殊担保、國務院對於覆文之全部、雖不爲之驚訝、但對於日本未予担保一點、則殊爲之失望、據消息靈通方面聲稱、該覆文至少有一點不能認爲滿意、卽日本希望美國於日軍申請外僑遷住安全之處時、能與日軍合作是、此間認此爲日本請美國承認日軍有指使駐華美國外交家行動之權、至對於日政府繼續拒絕承認日本軍事行動、損及美國產業之責任一節、失望之程度稍低、而並未特殊驚訝、（中央社一日路透電）</p>
<h3>首都發出突襲警報</h3>

<p>二十九軍駐滬辦事處接蕭市長振瀛來電云、（銜略）兄於三十晨抵濟南、前方各部隊均在激戰中、我軍最前綫仍固守××、韓主席軍隊正在佈防中、馮主席仰之弟所部與敵正在激戰、並負左冀掩護正面作戰任務、兄定今晚赴與仰之弟會晤商討各路整頓反攻辦法、請卽轉達各方爲盼、小兄蕭振瀛、（三十日中央社）</p>
<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>連日敵以我軍深構高壘。無所施其技。乃專以飛機大砲轟炸。如永安橋東某公墓敵砲兵陣地。向我沿蕰藻浜之胡家宅朱家宅及顧家宅劉行一帶轟炸。自二十九日晨五時起。至三十日晨七時止。歷二十六小時。繼續發砲竟達二千餘發。但我方僅死傷士兵二十餘人。若以砲彈命中之數計之。敵每發砲彈百枚。能死傷我士兵一人。則敵人砲彈可云多矣。</p>
<p>當然。敵人欲侵略我國的野心。蓄之已久。故其製造軍火的凖備。亦必已久。幷且敵人欲挑動世界大戰而趁火打刦者。亦已早具决心。則凖備與世界大戰的國家。宜其大砲與砲彈之充足也。</p>
<p>又我聞某地。敵機前往擲彈二十餘枚。其結果祇傷牛一頭。小孩一名。鄕人二名。此種浪費的砲彈與炸彈。不免爲之可惜。寄語敵人。姑且省省。且留待後日去參加世界大戰可也。</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Intense Full-Line Artillery War: The Enemy Fiercely Attacked Luodian and Liu Chu Suffered Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Enemy soldiers were annihilated in the villages between Liu Hang. Fierce battles raged continuously in the Zhabei Baziqiao area yesterday. Our army in Jiangwan adopted an offensive, inflicting blows on the enemy. Enemy forces in the city center showed signs of retreating.</p>
<p>For days, the enemy, using fresh troops and supported by aircraft, artillery, and tanks, attempted to break through a single point on our entire line and cut off our communication. The fighting between Luodian and Liuhang was particularly fierce. Our troops fought valiantly, meeting the enemy head-on with heavy blows. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties but ultimately could not cross the line. Their fourth general offensive has clearly suffered a preliminary and severe setback. From the extreme left flank of Liuhe to the extreme right flank of the Baziqiao North Station, our army's defensive fortifications are extraordinarily solid, and the deployed forces are also very strong. There is absolutely no weak point that the enemy can exploit to launch an attack. Yesterday, from dawn to late night, the fighting was primarily artillery-based. The enemy used hundreds of heavy artillery pieces, supplemented by naval gunfire, to conduct intensive shelling of our entire line, attempting to destroy our defensive fortifications first, and then send in large formations of troops to attack. Our loyal and brave frontline soldiers, lying in scattered trenches, waited patiently to kill the enemy and were absolutely not threatened in the slightest. At the same time, our heavy artillery units also returned fire. Throughout the day and night, the enemy fired at least several thousand shells, but the price they paid was almost equal to zero. In the Zhabei area, the sound of machine guns, rifles, and small mortars never ceased throughout the night. The fighting in the Baziqiao area was extremely fierce. As of 3:00 AM this morning, our Luodian, Liuhang, Jiangwan, and Zhabei lines remained firmly in place.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the enemy forces shelled Jiangwan indiscriminately. Our positions were not damaged in the slightest. At the same time, enemy forces in the city center area, due to their exposed position, feared being surrounded by us and showed signs of retreating.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Fourth General Offensive Begins with a Full-Scale Assault on Luodian and Liuhang</h3>
<p>Fierce artillery battles unfolded on both sides. All invading forces failed to achieve their objectives.</p>
<p>After the so-called fourth general offensive by the enemy forces began, the entire line was completely engulfed in intense artillery fire for the past two days. From Liuhe in the far northwest, through Luodian, Liuhang, Dachang, Jiangwan, to Baziqiao in Zhabei, there was enemy artillery fire everywhere. Rough estimates indicate that the enemy fired over 3,000 shells yesterday alone, with the aim of finding a weak point in our army's entire line of defense and attempting to break through. Their infantry hid in the rear, afraid to advance. Our army's positions, however, were extraordinarily solid and remained unmoved. At the same time, our artillery units did not show weakness and immediately returned fire. Thus, an unprecedentedly fierce artillery battle unfolded between the two sides, and the sound of artillery has not ceased even this morning.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Launch a Large-Scale Attack on Liuhang</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, under the cover of artillery fire and led by tanks, the enemy attempted to invade our army's positions at Xiqianzhai, located between Luodian and Liuhang to the east of the Shanghai-Tai Road. Our army calmly responded and, seeing that the enemy was approaching our warning line at Xiwangzhai, our artillery units immediately launched a unified attack, aiming and fiercely bombarding the enemy. Two enemy vehicles were immediately destroyed in the barbed wire we had placed, and the remaining vehicles were also severely damaged. The entire force was then forced to retreat.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy forces that launched a large-scale attack from the Liuhang area have been completely defeated after our two days of bloody and fierce fighting. From the afternoon of the 29th, the enemy forces used heavy artillery to intensely shell our line at Taipingqiao Zhangjialong, followed by over 20 tanks leading over 2,000 infantrymen to attack the vicinity of Zhoujiaxiang Xiwangzhai Tangjiabang Chenxiang. Our army calmly responded, maintaining strict vigilance. A portion of the enemy forces advanced to the eastern road of Zhangjialong, only 100 meters away from our army's position. At the same time, over 1,000 enemy soldiers moved north, attempting to cross the river near Yinjiajiao. Our army waited for the enemy to approach before charging out with a fierce attack, engaging the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. The sounds of shouting and killing shook the wilderness. The enemy's lines were thrown into chaos, and they retreated in disarray.</p>
<p>Stubborn Enemy at Taozhai Finally Collapses and Retreats</p>
<p>The enemy forces, hoping to break through our warning line between Luodian and Liuhang, first intensely shelled it all day the day before, and then launched a fierce attack at dawn yesterday. At that time, two enemy companies, led by 30 tanks, moved out from the enemy positions at Yangzhai and Jinjiazhai, crossed the Shanghai-Tai Road, and launched a fierce attack on the line of Taojiazhai, Zhoujiazhai, and Tangwan, about 300 meters south of Luodian. The attack was unusually fierce, but the area was characterized by interconnected fields and crisscrossing ditches, so their movement was sluggish. After our army fiercely bombarded them with mortars, the infantry behind them became even more timid and did not advance. After holding out like this until noon, they were finally repelled by us.</p>
<p>Small Squads of Enemy Soldiers are All Annihilated</p>
<p>At about 3:00 AM yesterday morning, about 200 enemy soldiers from the Yanghang area attacked our positions at Jiangjiazhai and Wangjiazhai near Liuhang. First, more than ten infantrymen crawled to the vicinity of our position. Although our army had detected them long ago, we pretended not to know, waiting for the rest of the enemy to rush up behind them. Our army then jumped out of the trenches together and fought fiercely, first killing all the crawling enemy soldiers, and then taking advantage of the momentum to charge and kill. The enemy hurriedly abandoned their weapons and fled back. Our army captured over a hundred rifles.</p>
<p>Intense Artillery Fire at Gujiazhai Town</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, the enemy artillery positions near Yanghang intensely bombed Gujiazhai Town and other places. Many civilian houses nearby caught fire from the shelling. The sound of artillery fire continued for more than five hours, and had not stopped slightly even by yesterday morning. At the same time, large squadrons of enemy planes indiscriminately bombed along the Shanghai-Tai Road. Dozens of shells landed in Dachang Town, and over a dozen civilian houses were destroyed. The night before last, about two enemy companies were attempting to move around the Zhouzhai area on the north bank of the Yunzaobang River. They were closely monitored by our warning line troops, and were bombarded with heavy artillery. The enemy forces were unable to move a single step. Yesterday morning, over ten enemy planes again bombed the vicinity. Our army has now deployed extremely solid fortifications in the area, and it is extremely difficult for the enemy to make any advances.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Shell Dachang and Jiangwan</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, enemy artillery positions northwest of the Yin Hang Shanghai Cemetery continuously fired shells, bombarding the Dachang and Jiangwan areas. Our army scattered to various key points to defend against enemy attacks, and remained hidden for a long time. No enemy soldiers were seen. According to scouts, large squadrons of enemy soldiers were moving towards Baoshan from the Nanshuijiahui area, apparently to increase troop strength to Yuepu in order to fiercely attack our line north of Liuhang. The artillery fire was to cover the movement of their troops.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles at Shi Xiangong Temple Twice</p>
<p>Fierce battles have been taking place in the Luodian area since the morning of the 29th. The enemy, using over ten tanks to cover over 800 infantrymen, attacked our positions near Shi Xiangong Temple. Our army used machine guns and hand grenades to counterattack the enemy. After fighting fiercely until evening, the enemy forces were unable to withstand the attacks and collapsed and retreated, leaving many corpses behind. At dawn yesterday morning, the enemy reorganized and attacked again. Our army calmly responded and fought fiercely until late at night. The enemy already showed signs of being unable to withstand the attacks.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles in the Zhabei Baziqiao Area Continued Throughout Yesterday</h3>
<p>Enemy Driven Out of Patriotic Girls' School</p>
<p>Starting at 3:00 PM yesterday, the enemy again used artillery and aircraft to intensely bomb the Baziqiao, Shuidian Road, Jiangwan Station, and Gaojingmiao Station areas, firing as many as four or five hundred shells, with the aim of destroying our fortifications and discovering our weaknesses in order to take advantage of the situation and attack. In addition to maintaining strict vigilance, our army also switched to the offensive and completely drove out the enemy entrenched in the Patriotic Girls' School. After completing the mission, our army retreated to its original defense. The school is now within our warning range.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles Between Our Forces and the Enemy at Baziqiao</p>
<p>At around 6:00 PM yesterday, about two companies of enemy marines from the 63 Garden and Baiben Cemetery areas, covered by tanks, attempted to invade Baziqiao. Our army tenaciously defended Fangjia Wooden Bridge, blocking the enemy's advance. At the same time, surprise troops were transferred from the Guangdong East Middle School and charged out from Guangzhong Road, launching a fierce attack on the flank of the 63 Garden, encountering the invading enemy forces and engaging in fierce fighting. In the chaos, the enemy suffered over twenty casualties and then lined up tanks as a formation to confront us. They were still in a stalemate until late at night, with machine guns and rifles firing continuously, sounding like a string of pearls, shaking the entire city.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Indiscriminately Bomb Zhabei</p>
<p>The enemy in the city center area continuously shelled our Zhabei area. After enemy planes repeatedly bombed the ruins of the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road, they believed that our fortifications had been destroyed. Therefore, at 11:00 PM the night before last, dozens of enemy soldiers boarded three small boats and sailed along the Henghama River North, attempting to land and attack in the Baoshan Road area. However, after being swept by our machine guns, they realized that we were prepared and immediately fled. A few minutes later, enemy artillery began shelling again, and it was especially fierce until dawn yesterday morning. Enemy planes also joined in the indiscriminate bombing, but our fortifications were not damaged. According to the garrison commander, the positions there are solid, and there will be no problem defending them for a year and a half.</p>
<h3>Our Army in Jiangwan Attacks and Annihilates the Enemy</h3>
<p>Enemy Attacks Our Warning Line and is Severely Struck</p>
<p>Our army in Jiangwan adopted an offensive. At 8:00 PM the night before last, we dispatched a portion of our troops from the Hejiaxiang position to attack the enemy forces at the Sijingqiu sports field. The enemy stubbornly resisted. After a night of fierce fighting, another portion of our troops took a detour to the enemy's rear and surrounded over 30 enemy soldiers east of the Xiangyin Road Jiangwan Racecourse. Although the enemy was stubborn, they were eventually annihilated by us. Our army retreated to its original defense at 1:00 AM yesterday morning. Soon after, three places in the northern dormitory of Fudan University caught fire and were still burning at noon.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the enemy used naval artillery, heavy artillery, tanks, small cannons, and machine guns—three types of firepower—to bombard our warning line north of Fudan University, attempting to force our outposts to retreat. Our army calmly responded, lying quietly behind defenses. When the enemy infantry approached our position, we immediately joined machine guns and sentries to counterattack until 7:30 PM. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and then retreated backward under the cover of tanks. Regarding this strategic section, we decided to take a preemptive strategy, attacking when the enemy did not advance to solidify our warning line.</p>
<h3>Enemy Plainclothes Teams Eliminated in Miaohang</h3>
<p>A small number of enemy plainclothes teams, disguised as refugees, crossed the Yunzaobang River and invaded the rear of our army's Miaohang position, advancing to the vicinity of the Tomb of Unknown Heroes, attempting to disrupt our army's rear. They were discovered by our army northeast of Dachang and immediately surrounded. Their numbers were small, and they were all eliminated. By noon yesterday, these plainclothes teams had been completely cleared.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Plot in Pudong Ultimately Fails</h3>
<p>Of the three small steamboats and sampans of the enemy anchored on the Pujiang River near Lujiazui, only one sampan remains. The two small steamboats have sailed away to other places. Moreover, near the shore of the Pujiang River near the Chunjiang Wharf in Lujiazui, the enemy secretly moved three large rubber sheets, leaning them diagonally against the ground on the shore, apparently to spy on the situation in our Pudong area and eavesdrop on the sound of artillery. The sampan is likely intended for escape.</p>
<p>Because its employees have scattered, the British-owned Xiang Sheng Iron Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, has recently been twice dared to be landed by enemy soldiers to spy on our military situation. The night before last, an enemy launch suddenly approached the outer barrier of the dock, which was immediately sunk by our army in the Pujiang River five feet away from the dock. The smokestack and the master's cabin are still above the water.</p>
<h3>Over Five Thousand More Enemy Soldiers Arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, four more large enemy transport ships arrived in the Pujiang River, carrying over 5,000 enemy soldiers and many horses. They berthed at the Osaka and Huangpu wharves. Also, before noon, two enemy transport ships berthed at the Osaka wharf and one enemy transport ship berthed at the north warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau at the Huishan wharf. After unloading military supplies, wood, lead sheets, and other items, they sailed away from the Pujiang River.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Continue to Transport Military Supplies to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Of the eight enemy transport ships that entered the Pujiang River yesterday, only one is still berthed at the China Merchants Bureau's north warehouse, and the rest have sailed away from the Pujiang River. The night before last and yesterday morning (the 30th), four more enemy transport ships arrived, berthing at the China Merchants Bureau's north warehouse, Huishan wharf, and Osaka wharf. The enemy soldiers on these four ships were busy transporting large quantities of lead sheets, wood, and military supplies from the ships to the Osaka and Huangpu wharves. Moreover, the enemy gunboat berthed at the New Mitsui Coal Yard left the Pujiang River in the afternoon yesterday, and has now returned to its old position, stealing a large amount of coal from the coal yard and secretly transporting it to the gunboat.</p>
<h3>A Frenchman is Tragically Killed in Hongkou</h3>
<p>A Frenchman named "Barman" was formerly an employee at a Russian bar on Yulin Road in Hongkou. Since the "August 13 Incident" occurred, traffic in Hongkou was cut off, and Barman was unable to escape. His relatives and friends searched everywhere for him without success, and then reported the fact of his disappearance to the French police. It was not until yesterday that a foreman from the Public Works Department discovered Barman's corpse in an alley on Kunming Road. The corpse had decomposed and was covered in gunshot wounds. It is not known why he offended the Japanese army and suffered this tragic death. The case has now been transferred to the French police for investigation.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Ambulances Again</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Countrymen's Association's Wartime Service Corps' ambulance team, a wartime support group, sets off for the front lines every day to rescue wounded soldiers who are fighting against the enemy. They are exceptionally courageous. At around 12:00 PM yesterday, while traveling near the Luoyang Bridge on Zhennan Road, three enemy planes attempted to bomb them, dropping over ten bombs, all of which landed in front of and behind the vehicles but failed to hit them. Seeing that their goal had not been achieved, the enemy planes flew low and strafed with machine guns, damaging the ambulances. Driver Li Ziqing was seriously injured. Team leader Tian Zhenfu, as well as Huang Yiran, Director of Comfort from the Cultural Circles National Salvation Association, Peng Qiyi, a reporter from the National Salvation Daily, and team members Jin Ren and others were all slightly injured.</p>
<h3>Map of the War Zone Near Luodian</h3>
<h3>The Division Commander is Robust, the Music is Old, and Enemy Soldiers are Exhausted by War</h3>
<p>They are all Grateful to Tears for Our Preferential Treatment</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Guomin News Agency met with Luo Dechuan, the leader of the Coal Mining Rescue Team. According to him, on the evening of the 26th of this month, our army captured an enemy platoon leader and a soldier. According to the enemy soldier, he entered the Wusongkou on the 19th, landed on the 20th, and went to the front line to join the battle on the 21st. He was injured on the 26th. He did not know beforehand that he was coming to Shanghai to fight. He only knew that he was coming to Shanghai to take over the defense. Since joining the battle, he had not been able to eat for six days due to insufficient supplies. He still had elderly parents at home. The soldier also said that he had been in the army for one year and ten months. In two more months, he could leave the military. "This is my own misfortune. I don't want to come to Shanghai to fight." All the Japanese soldiers fighting in China are also exhausted by the war. The enemy wounded soldier plans to send a letter to his parents in Japan, reporting that Japanese planes are bombing non-combatant areas and wounded soldiers' hospitals in China. This kind of situation disregards humanity and is completely the government's mistake. He hopes that the government will be informed immediately. "I am being treated very well after being captured. Please rest assured," and so on.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Full-Scale Attack on Shanghai Suffers Heavy Casualties and They Are Already in a State of Bitter Fighting</h3>
<p>Elite Troops are Repeatedly Annihilated by Our Army. The Weaknesses of the Enemy's Infantry Have Been Fully Exposed. Our Commanders Express Resolve to Defend Shanghai to the Death.</p>
<p>There have been fierce battles on the entire Shanghai front for days. Advances and retreats on the battlefield, and temporary gains and losses, are irrelevant to the overall situation. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper met with a senior commander who came to Shanghai on official business. He spoke freely about the recent military situation. As a result of the conversation, he told the reporter with a decisive attitude, "We are ordered to defend Shanghai, and we must defend Zhabei to the death. Pudong and Nanshi are both related to the overall situation and we must do our best to defend them." He continued, "Since the start of the war, the enemy army has repeatedly sent reinforcements, totaling seven or eight divisions, approximately 150,000 men. Although they have concentrated their main force and repeatedly attempted to succeed, our army is strong and our positions are solid, and we have not given them a chance. On the contrary, we have repeatedly depleted the enemy's elite troops, causing them to suffer heavy casualties and often be in a state of bitter fighting." In recent days, the enemy, unable to deploy their infantry due to our army's deep trenches and high fortresses, have switched to using aircraft and artillery to bomb us. For example, the enemy artillery position at a certain cemetery east of Yongan Bridge has been bombarding the Hujiazhai, Xiaozhuzhai, Gujiazhai, and Liuhang areas along the Yunzaobang River. From 5:00 AM yesterday (the 29th) to 7:00 AM this morning, they have fired continuously, reaching over 2,000 shells. However, our side only suffered twenty or so soldier deaths and injuries, while our army's positions remain unmoved. They are really at their wit's end and exhausted. Yesterday (29th), the enemy, with a company of men under the cover of aircraft and artillery, attacked our Baoshan Road area from the Bazilu Zhongzhoulu area. As of noon today (30th), they are still fighting fiercely. Also, the enemy artillery in the Yanghang area began bombarding again this noon (30th). At the same time, the enemy's main force north of Luodian is attempting to break through the Luodian to Caowangmiao Shi Xiangongmiao line, with the intention of flanking Jiangwan and Zhabei in a roundabout way. Our army has long seen through their trick and is determined to give them a heavy blow. Judging from the experience of the battles in the past fifty days, and the fact that our army has been holding the first line of defense for ten days, the enemy infantry has never been able to make progress. Not even a single village has been breached. The enemy's combat capabilities are like the donkey of Guizhou's tricks; they are nothing more than that. Even aircraft and heavy artillery can only wreak havoc on unprepared areas. Now that our army has made full preparations, the enemy will never be able to succeed, no matter what. This can be reported to the people of Shanghai, and also to the compatriots of the whole country."</p>
<h3>The Battle of Yangjia Village Proves That the Enemy Has No Fighting Spirit</h3>
<p>An Enemy Sergeant Takeshi Takeda's Diary Was Recovered. It Points Out That Our Army is Mighty, While the Enemy Finds the War Difficult. Two Regiments Were Almost Completely Annihilated.</p>
<p>Our military headquarters announced that in the battle of Yangjia Village on the 26th of this month (northwest of Luodian), the enemy attacked with the Takahashi and Sato regiments belonging to the Shigetou Detachment. After our army bravely intercepted them, the enemy army was almost completely annihilated. The three companies of the 1st, 4th, and 8th Regiments, which were surrounded by us in Taozhai, fled in panic and many were captured. Only three escaped with their lives. When we recovered the village, the enemy army's important documents and seals were all left on the desks, and firearms and ammunition were abandoned all over the road. One can imagine their disarray. According to refugees who escaped from the area, three enemy mid-level officers were injured and one was killed. We obtained a pair of riding boots belonging to Lieutenant Colonel Nakayama, further proving their disastrous defeat. The important documents have already been reported. Another item recovered was a diary from the enemy's Sergeant Takeshi Takeda, which said in brief: ㊀ The enemy (Japanese army) is busy with guarding and does not get enough sleep. ㊁ They are afraid of our night attacks and dare not sleep soundly all night. ㊂ Our army's resistance is unexpectedly strong and their attacks are skillful. The sound of mortars is frightening. ㊃ The enemy has run out of food several times and only relies on biscuits and bread, and recently they have been lacking bread and tobacco. They already feel the hardships of war and they are gradually increasing. ㊄ They miss home very much and hate war.</p>

<p>Special Discussion</p>
<h3>International Response and the Future of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Zou Taofen</p>
<p>The League of Nations General Assembly, on September 28th, passed the resolution proposed by the Twenty-Three Nation Advisory Committee, condemning the Japanese air force for bombing Chinese cities and massacring civilians. Fifty-two countries voted in favor. When the Assembly Chairman, Aga Khan, announced the resolution's passage, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause, an unprecedentedly enthusiastic scene. During the Advisory Committee meeting, representatives from various countries delivered impassioned speeches. The British representative, Cranborne, expressed that the profound grief and indignation felt throughout the civilized world upon hearing of such cruel bombing news were beyond words. The French representative, Delbos, also rose to declare that anyone who has seen reports of the bombing of Guangzhou, Nanjing, Hankou, and other places could not help but feel overwhelmed with grief and indignation, and that remaining silent would be tantamount to being an accomplice to the crime. If the conscience of the world does not rise up and speak out loudly today, civilization itself will be in danger of extinction. The Soviet representative, Litvinov, in addition to supporting Cranborne's condemnation of aerial bombing, further stated that condemnation of aerial methods should not be taken as regarding other methods of attacking China as justified. The U.S. authorities, who had been ambiguous and wavering, also expressed their agreement with the League of Nations' condemnation of Japan, stating that if the League of Nations had concrete suggestions, the U.S. State Department would carefully consider them. At the same time, the U.S. government declared it had repeatedly stated to the Japanese government that the unrestricted bombing of densely populated areas of China by Japanese aircraft was unjustified and violated the principles of law and humanity.</p>
<p>International public opinion and the masses have expressed even greater outrage at Japan's atrocities. The London Times, in an editorial, straightforwardly denounced the shamelessness of the brutal Japanese, and world opinion unanimously condemned them. The British press even advocated for economic sanctions. The movement of British people boycotting Japanese goods is developing rapidly and has spread throughout the country. The United States is also launching such a movement, and New Zealand and various parts of Southeast Asia are beginning to engage in this movement. Indian National Congress leader Nehru also initiated mass rallies in Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, and Rangoon, proposing resolutions for the Indian masses to implement boycotts of Japanese goods. The international atmosphere is filled with hatred for Japan, which is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Japan has always been known for its skillful propaganda. It is said that they value propaganda expenses as much as military expenses. But no matter how skilled their shameless spokespersons are at telling brazen lies, the recent cruel and brutal acts of massacring Chinese civilians will still incite global public outrage, and the victims of these cruel and brutal acts are countless Chinese civilians who have died in terrible agony. The purpose of the brutal Japanese is to intimidate the Chinese people with extremely cruel massacre methods. Based on their own shameless imagination, devoid of personal and national integrity, they believe that this can scare the Chinese people into submission, thereby achieving their dream of making China "yield." However, what they did not expect is that although the Chinese people have suffered the most tragic circumstances in the world, they have fallen one after another, with severed heads and broken arms, dying for the national crisis without regret. The only mentality that the masses have consistently held is to resist until the end, to fight until our robbers are driven out of the country, recover lost territories, and restore sovereignty before they are willing to stop. Spanish Foreign Minister Valentín Galarza Morante enthusiastically supported the League of Nations' resolution condemning Japanese atrocities at this General Assembly, declaring, "Spain extends its warm sympathy to the unity of the great Chinese nation." I believe that the Chinese people who are not afraid of dying tragically for the national crisis, their spiritual greatness, is truly a manifestation of the great Chinese national spirit, and cannot be imagined by those who use massacre as a means of intimidation. Merely being slaughtered can only arouse people's pity but not their respect. Even after suffering the most tragic and brutal bombing and slaughter, they can still fall one after another and continue to support the war of resistance to the end, continue to participate in the war of resistance to the end, and only in this way can they arouse people's respect.</p>
<p>"Japan, whether in peacetime or wartime, will ultimately rely on the world for survival." (Quote from The London Times) Japan needs foreign raw materials and foreign markets. It is unimaginable for Japan to try to detach itself from the world and act tyrannically to survive. Japan, which is invading our country, has been unanimously rejected by the world. The isolation of our enemy in the international arena is also our victory, and it also has a positive impact on the future of our war of resistance. To maintain this positive influence, to expand this positive influence, and to make this positive influence more realistic and more concrete, requires not only diplomatic maneuvering, but more fundamentally, it also lies in our own ability to live up to the spirit of the "great Chinese nation," to persevere in the war of resistance amidst hardships. The League of Nations' stern condemnation of the brutal Japanese atrocities this time, and the warm sympathy of public opinion and the masses in various countries, are exchanged for the blood, flesh, livers, and brains of our countless tragically deceased compatriots; they are exchanged for the great spirit of our countless compatriots who died for the national crisis. There is no good outcome without a price. If we want to gain greater international assistance, we must pay a greater price; this greater price is that we must strive in all aspects to ensure that our war of resistance can persist.</p>
<p>International response is indeed beneficial to the future of our war of resistance. But we must not overlook its source, we must not forget its source. We must grasp this point, and then we can have a correct understanding of the recent international response and the future of the war of resistance, and make further efforts.</p>
<h3>Thirty of Our Aircraft Flew to Pingxingguan to Assist in Battle</h3>

<h3>We Request That the League of Nations Concretely Discuss the Sino-Japanese Case</h3>

<h3>Proceedings of the Advisory Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations' Sino-Japanese Problem Twenty-Three Nation Advisory Committee held a meeting on the evening of the 29th, and immediately began a broad discussion of the complaint submitted by China. The American representative, Harrison, immediately reported the declaration issued by the US State Department yesterday. The document stated that the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem had sent the committee's resolution on the Japanese aircraft bombing undefended Chinese cities to the United States, and that enemy actions of bombing densely populated cities had been deemed illegal and violating the principles of international law and humanitarianism, etc. The Advisory Committee recorded the reply from the US State Department as reported by the US representative.</p>
<p>The Ecuadorian representative, Goffredo, then spoke, saying, "The current facts are very clear that this kind of action violating international law must be stopped by the League of Nations, and this illegal action must be declared to disregard the interests of all governments. The great powers have vast economic interests in China, a large country. If the League of Nations does not give China any moral assistance, what can other poorer countries expect when they are unfortunately sacrificed by aggressor countries? When a country infringes on the survival of another country, it must be condemned. If a country violates international law, all countries should stand up for justice. Our country entrusts culture to international law and will always support it. This committee should immediately take active action." The French representative, Tedesang, then spoke, saying, "This committee is now encountering a chaotic situation. Although some facts are clear, others are not. They must seek feasible solutions. If we submit this matter to a subcommittee, various issues can be handled more easily. Now that the draft resolution is ready, the subcommittee should work as soon as possible and report the results to the Advisory Committee at any time." The British representative, Cranborne, asked the committee to pay attention to the Far Eastern war, which originated from a very minor incident in North China. He also requested that Britain's policy toward the Far East be no different from other places, namely, to maintain peace and order so as to ensure the political and economic development of the Far East, while protecting the legitimate interests of all countries in the Far East. This policy is in line with the League of Nations Covenant and requires China and Japan to maintain friendly relations. Normally, the relations between China and Japan should be resolved directly by the two countries, but from the perspective of the League of Nations' obligations, this should not be the case. This conflict cannot be said to be a matter concerning only the two countries, but is actually related to all countries with economic interests in the Far East. Since the outbreak of the conflict between China and Japan, the British government has made representations to both China and Japan, especially regarding the withdrawal of troops from Shanghai, and has formulated practical suggestions. Furthermore, Britain has been in close contact with member states of the League of Nations, non-member states, and the great powers related to the Far Eastern issue since the beginning. All disputes should be localized and resolved through direct negotiations or through the intervention of the great powers. However, these efforts have all failed. Since the incident on July 16, Japan has taken various methods of making a mountain out of a molehill. They have begun various inhumane actions. The committee has already resolved to condemn Japan's methods of warfare, but the committee cannot take a wait-and-see attitude toward methods that cannot be implemented. Efforts to stop the war should not be relaxed in the slightest. Finally, Cranborne expressed his support for the Australian representative, Bruce's suggestion to convene a conference of Pacific powers to resolve the dispute. Therefore, the committee should instruct the subcommittee (attached to the Advisory Committee) to make every effort to adapt to the environment, and I also express my support for the French proposal."</p>
<p>Then, Dr. Wellington Koo, the chief representative of China to the League of Nations, stood up and said, "The war is happening in China, and innocent civilians in our country are being massacred. I hope that after the committee passes the resolution on Japanese aircraft bombing undefended cities in our country, it will work quickly and agree to organize a subcommittee to deal with specific methods. However, the overall issue of aggression should be discussed by the entire committee. The Japanese army has now dispatched 350,000 troops to China, and the Japanese fleet has blockaded the Chinese coast. Chinese provincial capitals have been bombed by Japanese aircraft in fourteen locations. I hope that the entire committee will express its views on this. The scope of the subcommittee should not be too large or too small. The Far Eastern issue involves the security of the whole world, so the subcommittee should not have a regional nature, but must represent the entire committee, and the committee should also give instructions to the subcommittee. The entire committee's declaration exposing Japan as an aggressor state is valuable assistance to the subcommittee."</p>
<p>The Australian representative, Bruce, said that the subcommittee should only consider and plan strategies, as suggested by the French representative. The Canadian representative stated that he would abstain from voting until he received instructions from his government.</p>
<p>The committee then decided to organize a subcommittee. Regarding the organization of the subcommittee, the chairman of the committee will make recommendations at the next meeting. In addition, the Soviet representative, Litvinov, and the Belgian representative, Spaak, both stated that the committee should organize a subcommittee and should meet immediately. After a short discussion, the committee decided to continue the meeting on the 30th, appoint a subcommittee, and give instructions. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 30th)</p>

Finally, the newspaper claimed that although the League of Nations today seems to have no real power, it has clearly demonstrated its spiritual and moral strength, and this strength can eventually restore its power.

Japanese aircraft bombings will be endless in the future, and unexpected events will continue to occur, so the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries will participate in the war, thus forming a Second World War. However, China does not expect to receive foreign aid, and the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact does not contain secret clauses. (National Telegram on the 29th)</p>

<h3>Economic Sanctions Against Japan Widely Supported in Britain</h3>
<p>Boycott of Japanese Goods Movement Sweeping the Nation National Labor Association Asks for Cooperation from All Countries</p>
<p>[London] The Times parliamentary correspondent reported today that because the national sentiment towards the means adopted by Japan in its aggression against China is becoming increasingly indignant, the cabinet ministers are extremely moved, and they acknowledge that since the letters from Liberal Party Member of Parliament Sir Acland and economic expert Keynes to the Times, requesting economic sanctions against Japan, have gained widespread support, and this request has been further strengthened by the National Labor Committee's meeting yesterday, requesting the government to prohibit British people from selling military supplies or lending money to Japan. The correspondent also stated that this situation will make the demand for an early reconvening of parliament more pressing. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>[London] Since the launch of the movement to boycott Japanese goods here, it has developed rapidly, making great strides. Many parties now advocate that various countries take appropriate economic measures to deal with Japan. The National Executive Committee of the Labor Movement (composed of leaders of the Trades Union Congress and the Labor Party) passed a resolution today expressing indignation at Japan's barbaric means of massacring Chinese civilians, appealing to the national labor class to take action against Japan, and demanding that the government: 1. Prohibit domestic merchants from selling munitions to Japan; 2. Prohibit domestic subjects from lending funds to Japan; 3. Propose to the League of Nations that all member states universally prohibit the import of Japanese goods; 4. Invite the United States to participate in international action to deal with Japan; 5. Ship medical supplies to China to assist the country's relief efforts. In addition, it also calls on British subjects to boycott Japanese goods in order to oppose Japanese atrocities. This resolution, in addition to being copied to the branches of the International Labor Federation in various countries, will also be distributed to labor groups in the United States and the British Empire's self-governing colonies to request cooperation. The Liberal Party's Star newspaper launched a mass rally to be held at the Albert Hall on the fifth of next month to discuss the situation in the Far East. At that time, the Archbishop of Canterbury will serve as chairman. The newspaper published an editorial today, calling on British people to participate enthusiastically. Representatives of the British Industry Federation and the China Association held a joint meeting today. Chairman Sir McDonald passed a resolution requesting the government to take appropriate measures so that the interests of British industry in China will not continue to suffer damage, and to find ways to restore normal trade, and to demand compensation from the responsible parties for the damages suffered by British merchants in the past. Prior to this, the representatives stated that the direct damage suffered by British merchants due to the war was not as great as that suffered due to the suspension of shipping. The joint meeting then decided to form a committee to monitor the development of the situation in the Far East and advocated that British ships should still be anchored in Wusongkou, China, as did French and Italian ships, in order to facilitate transportation. In addition, representatives of various factories that maintain interests in China also held a meeting today to discuss response measures, but did not mention the issue of boycotting Japanese goods. According to a representative's statement to the press, "We ourselves do not buy Japanese goods. What steps the government should take on this level, we have no claim on." The Leftist Writers' Club is scheduled to hold a gathering on the eighth of next month, and many dignitaries will give speeches to promote the movement to boycott Japanese goods. (Havass dispatch from Central News Agency on the 29th)</p>
<p>[London] The leaders of the London Free Church held a meeting today, and Huang Jingchun, the director of the Chinese government's purchasing committee in England, attended the meeting and gave a speech, saying that if Britain spends one more penny to buy Japanese goods, Japan will get one more penny to buy items to massacre our Chinese people. Former Chairman of the Union of Churches of England and Wales, Dr. Nohood, said that if my life depended on Japanese-produced goods, I should not buy and use them today. If Japan wins this time in China, we will soon suffer the same treatment in England as the rights holders do today. Earl of Lisseyville said that resisting Japanese goods can be effective very quickly. If Japan's tricks are allowed to continue, they will inevitably be applied to Western Europe in the future. After Professor Zhang Pengchun of Nankai University described the situation of the Japanese army bombing Tianjin, the conference passed a resolution expressing its anger at the Japanese aircraft bombing undefended cities and towns in China, and urging the British government and the League of Nations to take all possible methods to stop the continuation of this brutal behavior.

<h3>New South Wales Labor Council Issues Order to Boycott Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>⊙Sydney, Australia The New South Wales Labor Council Executive Committee has issued an order to boycott Japanese goods and notified all members to stop goods coming from and going to Japan. The council also urged the British Trades Union Congress to launch an anti-Japanese movement throughout the British Empire. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Indian National Congress Deeply Sympathetic to Us</h3>
<p>⊙Bombay When Indian National Congress leader Nehru met with a Reuters interviewer today, he declared that the National Congress hated Japan's massacre of thousands of lives in China. Nehru said that India could not stand idly by in the face of this tragedy. India now expresses its sympathy to the Chinese people. The entire Indian conference is now advocating boycotting Japanese goods, which shows a glimpse of public sentiment. The National Congress newspapers are now publishing the resolution of the South Wales Miners' Federation to boycott Japanese goods in a prominent position. National Congress leader Taisai and leader Satyarthi in the Central Assembly stated when they met with a Reuters reporter in Simla that Japan is a danger to world peace. Although Britain is not a victim, if it ignores being an accomplice of fascist powers, then it should make extra efforts to curb Japan's aggression in China.

<h3>British Financial Tycoon Donates £1,000</h3>
<p>To Relieve Our Country's Disaster Victims</p>
<p>[London] The famous British financier, Sir Bailey, today sent a letter to The Times, recalling that the Mayor of London launched an appeal to raise donations to relieve the victims of the Tokyo earthquake in 1924, resulting in the British generously donating hundreds of thousands of pounds to Japan. He then said that civilians in various Chinese cities are now being hit by Japanese bombs and shells, resulting in tens of thousands of people with disabilities, and the need for medical equipment is extremely urgent. This news is especially piercing when heard by people with disabilities who have received all kinds of good medical treatment. (One of Sir Bailey's legs was recently cut off, hence this statement.) Is this not the time for Britain to raise its voice and seek relief for Chinese disaster victims, at least to the same extent as the relief for Japanese earthquake victims in 1924? His intention is to first transport anesthetics and other drugs to Chinese ports by plane as soon as possible, and then use British fully equipped Red Cross ships to carry medical equipment and doctors to relieve the disaster. To raise this funding, he is now donating £1,000 as a guide. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 30th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Prospects for the War Situation</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>In the past few days, the battles in the North and South have been extremely fierce. The enemy troops in Shanghai have repeatedly used the latest mechanized units to launch full-scale attacks. However, our army's defense line has remained steadfast. Our defense capabilities are being strengthened every day. In the future, the enemy's offensive will only become more unfavorable. Therefore, on the front lines in this area, even if we do not counterattack and instead maintain a stalemate, it will be enough to exhaust the enemy's strength.</p>
<p>The war situation in the North seems to be more pressing. Since the enemy troops occupied Datong, although they encountered fierce resistance from our Jin-Sui forces, and suffered particularly significant losses in the Battle of Pingxingguan, they have been making every effort to expand the Chahar-Jehol transportation line in the past few days and massively increase their troops along the Ping-Sui Railway Line. The future of Jin-Sui is indeed still very worrying. Moreover, the main force of our army on the Cangzhou-Baoding Line has also shifted slightly southward due to strategic reasons. On the surface, the enemy's momentum to annex North China is gradually unfolding.</p>
<p>However, the superficial deterioration of the war in the North is largely due to past political shortcomings. These shortcomings are gradually being eliminated with the progress of the war of resistance. It is inevitable that the war situation will turn from dim to bright. Now we certainly cannot help but grieve that our villages and towns are being ravaged one by one by enemy cavalry, but we absolutely do not need to be discouraged. Because under the circumstances of a protracted scorched-earth war of resistance, any fierce means of aggression by the enemy will eventually be shattered.</p>
<h3>The United States Formally Expresses its Willingness to Cooperate Closely with Various Countries to Eliminate the Far East Crisis</h3>
<p>Willing to Consider Any Peaceful Proposals from the League of Nations Meetings Should Not Be Limited to Signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>[Washington] The State Department confirmed to the Associated Press today that the United States believes that the crisis in the Far East is a common problem for all countries in the world, and is not limited to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, or countries directly related to the Pacific. Therefore, the United States has broadened its perspective on the Far East issue, and at the same time seems somewhat indifferent to suggestions such as convening a conference of the Nine-Power Treaty or Pacific countries. At present, the United States has not formally received this suggestion, so there is nothing to decide, but it has made it clear that it is unwilling to limit this kind of effort to promote peace to a range of only a few countries.</p>
<p>State Department officials also asked reporters to pay attention to the following statements listed in Secretary of State Hull's peace declaration on August 23, namely, "Since there are threats to peace and serious conflicts everywhere in the world today, this issue should be of common concern to all countries in the world." The unanimous support of various countries in the world for this declaration at that time shows a glimpse of world public opinion on the Sino-Japanese conflict. Recently, the League of Nations' 52 countries unanimously condemned Japan's brutal bombing of Chinese civilians, which coincided with the United States' attitude. Moreover, the United States filed a protest with Japan regarding this atrocity, pointing out that it is intolerable to humanity, earlier than any other country. Finally, after the League of Nations condemned Japan's atrocity, Hull also expressed the United States government's approval.</p>
<p>In addition, the State Department's instruction for US representative Harrison to attend the League of Nations Advisory Committee further shows that the United States is prepared to participate in international cooperation to reduce the world crisis. Regarding the activities of the International Advisory Committee, the United States has made the following comments to the League of Nations: "The US government firmly believes in the principle of cooperation between countries in the world, and is willing to seek ways to promote the peaceful resolution of international conflicts. If the League of Nations has concrete suggestions to offer the United States, then the United States is very willing to consider them carefully, but for hypothetical inquiries, the United States is not in a position to immediately explain its position on policy and planning." In short, the notice issued by the United States to the League of Nations is extremely friendly. In terms of cooperation, it is unprecedented for the United States to issue a substantive statement to the League of Nations. As for the Nine-Power Treaty, State Department officials claimed that although there had been some informal consultations with the signatory countries of this treaty, there is no action today, and the treaty does not stipulate any council to take any action. Therefore, the United States believes that peace should be sought outside of this treaty in order to be appropriate. (National Telegram on the 29th)</p>

<h3>French Concession Authorities Striving to Assist in the Treatment of Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Wounded Soldiers Admitted into Concession as Much as Possible; Authorities on Both Sides Cooperating</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, the French Concession authorities in this city have been making visible efforts to assist in the treatment of our wounded soldiers. Subsequently, due to the discovery of cholera and dysentery at the front lines, and for the sake of the health of merchants and residents within the Concession, after consulting with our side, the admission of wounded soldiers into the French Concession was temporarily suspended for three days for arrangement purposes. As a result, many people in newspapers and private conversations or correspondence seemed to be unclear about the French Concession authorities' handling of our wounded soldiers, and there were occasional misunderstandings. According to reliable information, from the beginning of the Shanghai War until September 17, before cholera and dysentery were discovered in the Chinese troops on the battlefield, the French Concession admitted as many wounded soldiers as possible. They were freely distributed to public health organizations within the Concession by relief organizations, totaling 2,368 beds. Frankly speaking, all organizations completely lacked the work of categorization, arrangement, and distribution for the wounded soldiers. The transportation of wounded soldiers relied entirely on truck drivers sending them randomly, regardless of whether there were available beds in the hospitals. Therefore, at that time, trucks carrying wounded soldiers often lingered on the roads for several hours before reaching their destinations. After our government kindly notified them that cholera had been discovered at the front lines, the French Concession authorities, bearing the responsibility for the health of the residents, naturally took emergency measures to prevent the Concession from being threatened by foreign cholera. Therefore, on September 18, a joint meeting was held by the health administrative authorities of the British and French Concessions and the Chinese area, and it was decided to establish isolation hospitals to accommodate Chinese residents and soldiers from all three areas who had contracted infectious diseases. Moreover, our government decided to send lightly wounded soldiers to the interior for treatment, while seriously wounded soldiers were sent to Concession hospitals. The two Concessions had a total of 5,500 beds, and the French Concession was estimated to have 2,368 beds. According to this resolution, our government relocated the original patients and wounded from Zhongshan Hospital and converted it into an epidemic hospital. This procedure was completed rapidly within three days for quarantine purposes. During this period, no wounded soldiers were allowed to enter the two Concessions (but 100 wounded soldiers were exceptionally allowed on the 18th for isolation). To supplement the distinction between the seriously wounded and those infected, and to avoid ambulances searching for empty beds back and forth, and for the sake of emergency treatment for the wounded, it was further resolved that when wounded soldiers enter the French Concession or the Public Concession, they should be directly transported to two major hospitals with complete facilities (and six other hospitals are currently being organized) so that surgical operations can be performed immediately. In these hospitals, if the wounded soldiers can be moved after six days of observation, and it is determined that there is no risk of spreading infectious diseases to other wounded soldiers in the same room and residents, they will be sent to other hospitals for continued treatment. As for the daily number of wounded soldiers admitted, there is no absolute quota, but it is determined based on the number of empty beds and the average number of seriously wounded. Approximately 70 to 100 wounded soldiers can be accommodated daily in the two Concessions, and the number can be exceeded if necessary or possible. However, in fact, according to documents, the number of wounded soldiers that our government requests to accommodate is about 70 to 80 per day. We can inform all organizations and individuals who intend to add hospitals that as of September 26, there are still 704 empty beds in the French Concession. This number can prove that the Concession hospitals are sufficient for the wounded soldiers. Our country's health authorities are clearer about the needs of wounded soldiers' care than private individuals. Therefore, they first concentrated their efforts to merge small-scale relief efforts into more complete large-scale relief organizations. At the beginning of the Great War in France, the private but unorganized relief efforts were unified under military command, and the same difficulties and errors were encountered. Therefore, the French Concession authorities strongly support our country's centralization policy. As mentioned above, it can be clear about the spirit of the French Concession's approach to wounded soldiers, which is entirely to: ① Double the emergency protection of residents within the Concession to prevent serious epidemics from abroad; ② Cooperate with the Chinese health authorities to make the existing and still-preparing hospitals more effective. In short, the French Concession's administrative and health authorities and our government agree to use the most effective methods to eliminate all poverty and diseases that hinder the residents of the Concession. Therefore, both in theory and in interest, the French Concession authorities are doing their best to help with the care of our wounded soldiers, and at least do not hinder the cooperation between the two parties.</p>
<h3>Prompt Handling of Tax Payments</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to the Four Banks Review Committee to Expedite Approval and Alleviate Difficulties</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the Joint Review Committee of the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks. The letter stated: We have received a letter from the Shanghai Woolen Fabric Trade Association stating that they have received a letter from your committee with the Central Bank's Business Bureau Letter No. 4707, which states that merchants paying taxes with checks will not be subject to the restrictions of Article 1 of the Financial Stability Measures. However, a special application form must be filled out in duplicate and submitted to the deposit bank for transfer to the Review Committee for approval and payment. Accordingly, we have enclosed a blank application form in duplicate with this letter for your association to forward to the trade for consideration. After reviewing this application, the deposit bank will forward it to the Review Committee for approval. This process involves multiple steps, and we are concerned that any delays may cause significant losses to the applicant. Our association members have a fixed period to pay taxes and duties, and overdue payments are subject to penalties and surcharges. Furthermore, the goods for which taxes are paid are urgently needed for sale in the market, and are subject to time constraints due to trade contracts and seasonal needs. We are deeply concerned that the delay in forwarding the application for review may cause irreparable damage. Therefore, we are writing to your committee, requesting that you forward our request to the review authorities to expedite the processing of tax payment applications, to expedite approval, alleviate difficulties, and reduce losses. We pray that you will investigate and act accordingly.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds Subscription Nearly Half Complete</h3>
<p>Subscriptions Amount to Over 240 Million Yuan; Approximately 60 Million Yuan Already Received</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the National Salvation Bonds Promotion Association has been actively promoting subscriptions both domestically and abroad for just over a month. As of September 29, subscriptions have reached over 244.1 million yuan, and over 60.96 million yuan has been received.

<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Wartime Refugee Relief Association Established Today</h3>
<p>Has Taken Over All Affairs of the Relief Association; Still Operating on the Second Floor of the Pudong Building</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Committee has been ordered by the municipal government to reorganize into the Shanghai Branch of the Wartime Refugee Relief Committee. We have learned that the committee completed its work yesterday (the 30th) and transferred all affairs to the Shanghai Branch of the Wartime Refugee Relief Committee. The organization of the branch is jointly established by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, the Two-Roads Bureau, the Navigation Administration Bureau and its affiliated bureaus, and various groups and institutions such as the Shanghai Local Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Starting today, it will officially operate at the old site of the Relief Association on the second floor of the Pudong Building. The internal organization of the association, except for the chairman Pan Gongzhan, the secretary director Mao Yun, and the secretaries Lei Kenan and Lu Huren, remains the same. Most of the directors of the various groups are still serving as the original directors of the Relief Association. However, the medicine group has been changed to the health group, and the director is still Xu Xiaochu. A rescue group has also been added, with Qu Wenliu as the director. Chang Jiafu has resigned as a standing committee member and has been approved by the branch to be presented to the municipal government. In addition, Lu Ganchen has been hired to take over. It is also heard that the authority of the branch is to manage the city's relief affairs. In the future, the relief work done by various hometown associations and charitable organizations will be reported to the branch for assessment and guidance. Chen, at No. 364, Lane 3, Intersection of Yilu and Chengdu Roads, is waiting for help at a discounted price, willing to exchange donation receipts for goods, not accepting cash. Mr. Chen held a painting exhibition in January of this year in response to the Suiyuan Aid Movement, which was well received. His paintings have unique artistic conception and many works that inspire the national spirit. This temporary exhibition is entirely for encouraging the people to donate. The date is from the 1st to the 7th, and the viewing time is from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. This is also a practical movement of the art circles in our country during the Anti-Japanese War, and it is something that those who are enthusiastic about national affairs and love art are happy to hear.</p>
<h3>Catholic Church Holds Grand Mass</h3>
<p>Led by Bishop Hu, Praying for Our Victory</p>
<p>Bishop Hu of the Catholic Church in this city has decided to preside over a grand Mass at the St. Peter's Church on Xinzha Road starting today (October 1st), leading the clergy to pray for the victory of our country in the Anti-Japanese War. It is heard that Bishop Hu recently also instructed the clergy in the Shanghai area to do their best under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, fulfilling their duties.</p>
<h3>New Writing Association Asks to Promote Latinized Writing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Writing Research Association believes that Latinized New Writing is simple and easy to learn and will help popularize wartime education. Therefore, it submitted a written request to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to promote it. The original submission is as follows: "... Now that the overall war of resistance has begun, organizing the masses and providing them with wartime education is extremely important work. The masses in the front and rear must be informed of the great national righteousness and taught wartime knowledge, so that they can assist the army, eliminate traitors, maintain order, and strive for production. However, in the world of war, there is no room for leisurely education. The key is to achieve the greatest effect in the shortest time. Chinese characters are difficult and cumbersome, and teaching illiterates is twice the work with half the results. Latinized New Writing is simple and easy to learn and is a good tool for education at this time, which can help make up for the shortcomings of Chinese character education. We respectfully request that you issue a clear order to promote it and lead this kind of new writing group and various educational groups to make a comprehensive plan, carefully produce teaching materials, and actively promote it in order to cultivate the national foundation and enhance the strength of the war of resistance. This is a public convenience..."</p>

<p>Wartime Youth</p>
<h3>Inaugural Declaration</h3>
<p>— Ming Shi</p>
<p>Since the Songhu War of Resistance, five decades have passed in an instant. The fierce flames of the brutal enemy are still raging, and they have no intention of repentance. Even if they cannot avoid the danger of self-immolation in the future, our responsibilities today cannot be easily shirked. In this time of resistance, we should concentrate our strength to plan for resisting aggression and seeking survival. Every man and woman should "hate the evil that does not come from within themselves" in order to fulfill their national duties. Young people are full of energy and entrusted with heavy responsibilities. They should especially strengthen their strength in preparation for a long-term war of resistance. Therefore, the exploration of wartime knowledge, the training of skills, the cultivation of character, and the stimulation of enthusiasm are all necessary. Otherwise, they will not be worthy of being modern Chinese youth.</p>
<p>Following this principle, in addition to gathering more than 2,000 young men and women scouts to devote themselves to wartime service work, this group thinks to use its remaining strength to encourage young people across the country to improve themselves, so that they can enrich their knowledge and complete the mission of preparation. Then, they can exert their great power, go to the national crisis together, sweep away the Japanese invaders, and revive the nation. May our comrades encourage each other.</p>
<p>From now on, we especially hope that the leading figures in the country and the virtuous and talented people from all walks of life will give us guidance and correct our shortcomings, so that the future of the nation may have a chance.</p>
<h3>Sacrifice and Resistance</h3>
<p>— Zhong Quan</p>
<p>At noon on the day commemorating the sixth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, I stood at attention very respectfully, listening to the radio's commands. I also remained silent very solemnly, recalling the many bloody and tearful wounds of the past. I also shouted very tragically, roaring out "Sacrifice to the end, resist to the end!" These are the last two vows. I firmly believe that these two vows are our only secret to resisting the aggression of Japanese imperialism, and they are also the necessary conditions for us to win the final victory.</p>
<p>"Resistance" is a method of striving for survival, and "sacrifice" is the most needed capital for "resistance". With a method and capital, we must also have determination. If all three conditions are met, then victory is assured, and there is naturally no problem.</p>
<p>Chinese soldiers and civilians, at this critical moment for the survival of the country and the rise and fall of the nation, must not only not be afraid of sacrifice, but also be prepared to sacrifice. Here, we would like to quote Chairman Chiang's words again: "The people of the whole country must clearly recognize the meaning of the so-called final moment. When the final moment arrives, we can only sacrifice to the end and resist to the end. Only with the determination to sacrifice to the end can we win the final victory."</p>
<h3>Wartime Youth</h3>
<p>— Yuan Sheng</p>
<p>Everyone agrees that young people are the most promising people in a country, and they are also the lifeblood of the country. History tells us that the strength of Germany and the restoration of Japan were all created by the power of youth. In other words, this is entirely the great and special achievement of youth.</p>
<p>The relationship between wartime youth and the country is naturally even closer. During the World War, Germany mobilized a large number of young people to work in the front and rear. Their spirit of service really makes us sigh! Although, as a result of the war, Germany was defeated, the spirit of the general youth did not fail, and they were still generally vigorous. So even today, Germany is still a well-known power.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the "August 13" Shanghai War, a group of young people in Shanghai has established many national salvation groups, doing various things that wartime youth should do. But the fact is in front of us, our work is fundamentally not enough, anyway, our strength is very weak.</p>
<p>From today onwards, we must further mobilize Chinese youth to do wartime work; from today onwards, we must further concentrate our strength to contribute to the country. At the same time, we must also pay attention to the fact that being a wartime youth is not just a matter of empty talk. We must earnestly do practical work, which is the true expression of the spirit of wartime youth!</p>
<h3>A Cannon Sound</h3>
<p>— Lao Yu</p>
<p>A cannon sound woke me up, and I immediately got out of bed. At this time, the pocket watch told me it was exactly 5:05.</p>
<p>The light slowly pushed away from the circle of darkness, and the sun gradually emerged from the clouds; the sky was draped in the color of fish belly, which symbolizes a promising youth with a vibrant and energetic spirit.</p>
<p>Stepping into the office, I saw eight or nine girl scouts working very hard on a great task - sewing cotton vests for the soldiers on the front lines - I watched them, some cutting cloth, some spreading flowers, some sewing, the work was extremely tense</p>
<p>From a cannon sound, I suddenly thought of the work of these girl scouts, what kind of feelings would be stirred up in my heart?</p>
<p>Soldiers on the front lines are bravely fighting the enemy in the cold wind, and the people in the rear are rushing to make winter clothes for them. This mutual spirit will make our strength to resist the enemy greater, stronger, and more consolidated!</p>

<h3>The Enemy Pours All Its Strength into General Assault; Our Army's Position is Rock Solid</h3>
<p>The Enemy Sets a Three-Day Deadline to Seize Our First Line of Defense; After Our Multidirectional Fierce Attack, Over 6,000 Enemy Soldiers Have Been Killed; The Enemy's Three-Pronged Attack on Liuhang is Crushed</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Military News: The enemy's commander-in-chief, Matsui, leading the three armies of the sea, land, and air, has launched a large-scale invasion of Songhu, originally hoping to take Songhu in one fell swoop. However, since the start of the war, it has been five decades, and they have been repeatedly and fiercely attacked by our army. Not only has there been no progress, but they have also suffered losses and casualties. They had no choice but to reorganize their troops and request reinforcements. This preparation work was completed a few days ago. Matsui then issued an order on the morning of the 29th, from now until 12:00 pm on October 1st (today), ordering the three armies to launch a general assault on the entire line, and limiting them to occupy Jiading, Liuhe, Liuhang, Dachang, Zhabei, Pudong, and other places within three days. Therefore, the battles on all fronts have been extremely fierce in the past two days. However, our army's position is solid, and the soldiers are extremely brave, giving them head-on blows everywhere. Therefore, as of this afternoon, the enemy's deadline is about to expire, and the result of their general assault on the entire line has failed in Luodian, Yanghang, the city center, and the Jiangwan Zhabei area, and the casualties have reached more than 6,000 people. The situation on various fronts today is as follows: There has been fierce fighting on the line from Zhabei to Jiangwan from yesterday to this afternoon. Our army bravely defended and repelled them. On the line from the Municipal Public Cemetery to the Sun House in Yunzaobang, our surveillance is tight, and the enemy has never dared to attack lightly. Although there have been small-scale disturbances from time to time, they immediately fled back when they saw our army attacking. On the line from Zhongxingzhai, Mengwan, Yangmuqiao, Chaowangmiao, and Jinjiazhai in Luodian, the enemy has launched fierce attacks yesterday and today, especially in the area from Yongan Bridge to Yangmuqiao. However, the enemy has never been able to violate our territory, and our front line remains unmovable. The line from Zhangjiayan to Caowangmiao in the northwest of Luodian is in our hands. The enemy has been attacking fiercely for the past two days, but they have been repelled by our army.</p>
<h3>Our Army in Northeast Liuhang Annhilates the Enemy in Several Ways</h3>
<p>The Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses from the Fourth General Attack</p>
<p>Since the enemy army began its fourth general attack on our army on the evening of the 28th of last month, bloody battles have been waged on all fronts in recent days, especially on the Luodian and Liuhang lines. The intention is nothing more than to try to break through our army's front line, so the Liuhang line is very important. After our army fought bloodily, the front line remained unshaken. Since last night, our army has launched a full-scale assault on the enemy northeast of Liuhang. As a result of the bloody battle, the enemy army has been completely defeated, and there is no trace of the enemy in the vicinity. The enemy's fourth general attack has clearly suffered a serious blow from our army.</p>
<p>Yinjia Pavilion - The Enemy Plans to Cross the River</p>
<p>For the past two days, the enemy has been continuously bombing our positions in the Liuhang area with aircraft and heavy artillery, attempting to destroy our fortifications. Yesterday afternoon, at the same time, more than 2,000 infantry, under the cover of more than 20 tanks, attacked the Zhoujiagang and Xiwangzhai area northeast of Liuhang. At the same time, more than 1,000 enemies moved north, attempting to cross the river near Yinjia Pavilion on the side of the Hutai Highway. They were bravely greeted by our army, and the enemy army retreated with injuries.</p>
<p>Guoxiang Qiao - The Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Also, near Shenjiazhai Guoxiangqiao, a large number of enemy troops attempted to cross the river and invade the Zhangjiazhai, Dujiazhai, and Lizhai area. After our army waited for them to approach, it suddenly launched a surprise attack, with hand grenades and machine guns firing densely. A part of the army charged with bayonets. The enemy was caught off guard and fell to the ground after being shot. The rest fled in panic and suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Wangjiazhai - Our Army Annihilates the Enemy</p>
<p>At dawn yesterday morning, the enemy attacked the Jiangjiazhai Wangjiazhai area. A few of their infantry advanced to the front of our position and were killed by our hand grenades, killing more than ten people and seizing eight rifles. The rest all fled. After a while, the enemy artillery fired fiercely on the area, seemingly as retaliation, but our side suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Qiujiang Road - The Enemy's Attack is Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Repelled by Our Mortars and Machine Guns</p>
<p>The enemy troops in the Zhabei and North Sichuan Road area used two companies of troops this morning at dawn, under the cover of five or six tanks, and advanced along Qiujiang Road towards our army. At that time, our defending troops immediately fired mortars and light and heavy machine guns at them, and used hand grenades to bomb the enemy vehicles. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy continued to increase troops and attacked our line. Our army then jumped out of the trenches and charged with bayonets. After fighting for about two hours, more than 60 enemy soldiers were killed or injured and gradually became unable to support themselves. They began to retreat. Our army returned to defend the original front line, but the enemy planes still went to reconnoiter and drop bombs from time to time, but they were not hit. Only a few houses were destroyed, and more than ten civilians were injured.</p>
<h3>Our Artillery Hits the Enemy Headquarters</h3>
<p>Southeastern Wall Pierced by a Hole</p>
<p>At about 5:00 this morning, the enemy troops in the Yangshupu area used artillery to bombard the troops stationed in the Baoshan Road area of Zhabei. Before long, the enemy artillery in the city center also responded. Our army counterattacked. At about 6:00, enemy planes arrived again, taking turns dropping bombs on the northern section of Baoshan Road. The enemy planes have been bombing this place as a target for days, so the houses in the area have been destroyed. Also, at about 10:00 in the morning, when the enemy artillery in the city center was bombarding us fiercely, a heavy artillery shell from our side hit the southeastern wall of the barracks of the enemy Marine Corps headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. With a crash, mud and sand rushed into the sky, and a large hole had formed in the corner of the wall.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, there was no fierce fighting in the Jiangwan area from yesterday to this morning. The enemy's artillery occasionally fired and bombed our positions, seemingly testing our movements. Only skirmishes occurred in the Jiangwan Racecourse area. There were no changes in the positions of both sides.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ambush East of Zhongxing Residence</h3>
<p>Over 400 Enemy Soldiers Almost Entirely Annihilated by Our Forces.</p>
<p>Enemy Uses Dum-Dum Bullets in Violation of International Law.</p>
<p>Since September 28th, when the enemy launched its fourth general offensive, it has concentrated all of its elite troops to attack our entire line, with the Luo Dian-Liu Xing line being the most intense, seemingly hoping to break through our central line to threaten our rear. However, after days of fierce fighting by our loyal and brave soldiers, the enemy has not only failed to make any headway but has instead suffered repeated defeats and heavy losses. Although enemy artillery rained down like bullets, it ultimately failed to diminish our momentum. To conserve its strength and avoid the direct assault of our forces, the enemy has urgently adopted guerrilla tactics. Starting on the night of the 28th, after firing over a thousand shells, several large units advanced along remote and secluded paths towards the east, north, and south of Luo Dian. Our forces immediately engaged in battle. After a brief clash, the enemy troops collapsed. Our army took advantage of the victory and advanced as far as five miles. However, at dawn on the 29th, under the cover of its aircraft and artillery, the enemy launched an attack on our newly occupied positions with a regiment-sized force, focusing on the southeast direction of Liu Xing. The troops defending Zhongxing Residence, upon learning of the enemy's strength, immediately dispatched a detachment, silently and swiftly, to reach [illegible] to outflank the enemy and coordinate with our frontal forces. However, the enemy remained unaware that it had been ambushed and continued to advance. Seeing them approach, our army issued a command, leaped out of the trenches, and fiercely attacked the enemy with light and heavy weapons. Despite their stubborn resistance, the enemy continued to advance as a group. At this time, our ambush forces rose up together, surrounding the enemy on all sides. The enemy soldiers realized they had been ambushed, but it was too late to retreat. They were almost entirely annihilated by our forces, with dead and wounded scattered across the field, totaling over 400 men. A large amount of enemy supplies were captured. In the evening, the enemy again attacked Zhongxing Residence with mechanized units, concentrating its artillery fire on that area. Our [illegible] artillery positions responded with a fierce counterattack, while our mortar and machine gun units were deployed to meet the enemy head-on. The intense fighting lasted until midnight, when the enemy, suffering heavy casualties, retreated in disarray. Our side also sustained some damage. On the morning of the 30th, at 11:00 AM, the enemy launched another attack, but was again repelled by our forces. Unexpectedly, the enemy violated international law by supplying its front lines with dum-dum bullets, causing several of our soldiers to be injured. However, their tactics and morale ultimately cannot compete with ours. Under our courageous attacks, they were unable to withstand and collapsed in retreat, and subsequently did not dare to attack again.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Shifting Gun Positions Towards Pudong</h3>
<p>Appears to be Preparing for a Major Invasion of Pudong</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from This Newspaper: According to intelligence reports, all gun positions of enemy warships in the Huangpu River are now aimed at Pudong. Furthermore, in recent days, enemy forces have transported a large number of rafts and small motorboats to the downstream river area, suggesting a major invasion of Pudong.</p>
<h3>Puppet Troops of Yunzaobang Used as Cannon Fodder</h3>
<p>The enemy at Yunzaobang is advancing westward along the north bank, having reached the vicinity of Hu Residence and Zhou Residence, where they are building fortifications. Troop movements are unusually busy, and many soldiers in grey uniforms of the puppet Manchukuo army have been requisitioned by the enemy to be used as cannon fodder. Hu Residence and Zhou Residence are located approximately two kilometers south of Miaohang, and this area is one of their objectives for the enemy's launch of a full-scale general offensive. Therefore, three or four heavy artillery guns have been deployed near Hu Residence, repeatedly shelling our positions, but most of the shells landed in the fields and did not explode. Our forces recovered artillery shells bearing the inscription "Made in Fengtian in the 11th Year of the Republic of China." These were likely stolen from the three northeastern provinces during the "September 18th Incident" and are now being used against us, which is truly heartbreaking to mention. Furthermore, enemy forces are lying in ambush on the north bank, frequently using machine guns to sweep our positions, hoping to force our troops to retreat, cross the river, and invade. However, our forces are firmly defending the river, and the enemy has never had the opportunity to cross it stealthily.</p>
<h3>Enemy Reinforcements Have Completely Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Totaling One Division and One Brigade, Approximately 40,000 Troops</p>
<p>The enemy's fourth wave of reinforcements, consisting of one division and one brigade, totaling approximately 40,000 men, has been arriving in Shanghai continuously in recent days, with the total number reaching approximately 35,000. They began their fourth general offensive yesterday (September 28th). This morning, from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM, six more enemy merchant ships converted into transport vessels successively sailed into Shanghai: No. 52 Seito Maru, No. 136 Kaihei Maru, No. 46 Akashi Maru, No. 266 Zenyo Maru, No. 262 Taian Maru, and No. 170 Soyo Maru. They docked at Osaka, Huangpu, and Huishan wharves, respectively. It is reported that the final batch of the enemy's fourth wave of reinforcements, approximately 6,000 men, landed there.</p>
<h3>Our Senior Officials Inspect Zhabei</h3>
<p>Extremely Satisfied with the Solidified Defense</p>
<p>In recent days, the enemy has repeatedly launched attacks on our Zhabei front with fierce artillery fire. Our loyal and brave soldiers have resisted heroically, and the enemy has ultimately failed. Our senior generals personally visited the line yesterday to inspect the defenses and comfort the soldiers at the front. They were very satisfied with the solid fortifications built by our troops and highly commended the commanders on the line. The enemy's stubbornness and repeated attempts at violent attacks, which ultimately ended in failure, were within expectations.</p>
<h3>General Matsui at His Wit's End</h3>
<p>Engaging in Political Activities in Addition to Supervising the Troops, Hitting Walls Everywhere, Unable to Use His Tricks</p>
<p>Another report: The Japanese government's dispatch of Matsui to Shanghai is not purely for military matters, but also carries a political nature, as Matsui has many acquaintances in Shanghai. However, after arriving in Shanghai, he made numerous phone calls, but no one responded. His bag of tricks is useless and he cannot develop his plans.</p>
<h3>Japan Dispatches Diplomats to Shanghai</h3>
<p>To Liaise with Consulates of Various Countries in Shanghai, Wielding Diplomatic Power with Ulterior Motives</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from This Newspaper: A reporter has learned from diplomatic circles that, in view of its diplomatic isolation, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has dispatched more than ten veteran diplomats (including diplomatic envoys who have served in European and American countries) and experts on China, led by Sato as the team leader. They are scheduled to depart for Shanghai on the 3rd of this month aboard the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru, to liaise with consulates of various countries in Shanghai and attempt to influence leaders from all sectors of Chinese society, wielding diplomatic power with ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The tyranny of the violent Japanese is causing widespread outrage, but the enemy stubbornly refuses to see reason and persists in its own way. Previously, they planned to send people's envoys to European and American countries to try to justify their deceptive arguments. Recently, they have selected veteran European and American diplomats and so-called "China experts" to come to Shanghai, led by a person named Sato. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai within days. It is said that after arriving in Shanghai, they will be engaging in activities with leaders of European and American countries in Shanghai. However, the facts are clear, and it is believed that people in Europe and America will not be deceived.</p>
<h3>Over 4,000 Enemy Student Soldiers Arrive</h3>
<p>Deployed to Luodian to Reinforce the Kurume Division</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from This Newspaper: Two enemy transport ships have arrived in Shanghai from Japan in the past two days, docking at Huishan Wharf, carrying approximately 4,000 "defense" soldiers. These troops are all young students and are scheduled to be deployed to Luodian and Yuepu to reinforce the Kurume Division.</p>
<h3>Hasegawa Makes Unreasonable Demand for Relocation of Warships of Various Countries</h3>
<p>Attempting to Occupy Nanshi, Hindering Military Operations.</p>
<p>Sternly Rejected by the Naval Authorities of Various Countries.</p>
<p>Determined Not to Abandon Defense in Any Dangerous Situation.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the enemy army is currently actively attempting to occupy Nanshi. However, due to the presence of many warships from various countries anchored in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River (i.e., the Pudong section of the foreign concession), which hinders military operations, they are unable to land rashly. Therefore, Hasegawa, Commander of the Enemy Third Fleet, dispatched Naval Attaché Takeda and Staff Officer Oda as representatives, via motorboat to the Xinkaihe River, to visit the naval commanders of six countries - Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands - requesting that the warships of these countries relocate to the lower reaches of the Huangpu River within 24 hours to facilitate the Japanese army's attack on Nanshi. However, the naval authorities of various countries immediately and sternly rejected this demand, unanimously stating that for the sake of protecting their respective nationals and maintaining the security of the foreign concession, they would not abandon their original defenses under any dangerous circumstances. However, it is rumored that the naval commanders of three unnamed countries held a meeting in the afternoon to discuss a response, but the details are unknown.</p>
<h3>British Church and Red Cross Launch Fundraising Campaign</h3>
<p>To Aid Our Wounded Soldiers and Refugees. London Mayor and Bishop Take the Lead</p>
<p>[London] Reuters reports: The China Association, the British Missionary Alliance, and the British Red Cross are launching a joint appeal tomorrow to raise funds to aid Chinese wounded soldiers and civilians. The appeal will be led by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of Westminster, and the Lord Mayor of London. Sir Bailey, a famous financier, has also donated £1,000 to promote the response. At the same time, the League of Nations Union has decided to petition the British government to bear at least £100,000 for the League of Nations to send medical teams to China. The Union has also decided to request the government to find ways to have the League of Nations declare China as a victim of aggression, and that all member states of the League of Nations should take various measures to eliminate Japan's ability to continue its aggression and not purchase Japanese goods. Only when all countries unite can significant results be achieved. The resolution further stated that the government should strive to ensure that the League of Nations Assembly does not adjourn until the League of Nations takes effective and consistent action (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 1st).</p>
<h3>United States Disappointed with Japan's Reply</h3>
<p>[Washington] The United States protested to the Japanese government because Japanese aircraft indiscriminately bombed Chinese non-combatants. The Japanese government's reply did not contain special guarantees. The State Department was not surprised by the entire reply, but was particularly disappointed that Japan did not provide guarantees. According to well-informed sources, at least one point in the reply was unacceptable: Japan's hope that the United States would cooperate with the Japanese army when it applied for foreigners to move to a safe place. It is believed here that this is Japan asking the United States to recognize the Japanese army's right to instruct the actions of American diplomats stationed in China. The degree of disappointment was slightly lower but not particularly surprised by the Japanese government's continued refusal to acknowledge responsibility for the damage to American industry caused by Japanese military actions (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 1st).</p>
<h3>Sudden Air Raid Alert Issued in the Capital</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] At 10:30 AM today, an air raid alert was issued again in the capital city. At 10:45 AM, radio broadcasts were suspended. As of the time of the dispatch, no enemy aircraft had been seen arriving (Dispatch at 11:00 AM on the 1st).</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Sighted Near the East and West Sha Islands</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou] According to transportation circles, two enemy warships sailed into Dongmayu Port on the 29th. Three enemy warships were sighted near the East and West Sha Islands (Central News Agency dispatch on the 30th).</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Reconnoiter Huaiyin Again This Morning</h3>
<p>[Huaiyin] At 7:00 AM on the 1st, three enemy aircraft came to Huaiyin from the sea to reconnoiter, circling high in the sky for twenty minutes. Two flew northwest and one flew southwest (Special dispatch on the 1st).</p>
<h3>Ma Lin Returns to the Province, Resumes Duties After Leave</h3>
<p>[Xi'an] Ma Bufang, acting chairman of Qinghai Province, telegraphed the Shaanxi News Agency that Chairman Ma Lin has recovered from his illness and returned to the provincial capital from his native Linzhen on the 27th to resume duties after leave (Central News Agency dispatch on the 30th).</p>
<p>[Xi'an] Ma Hongbin took the Longhai train to Beijing at 10:00 AM on the 30th, accompanied by Li Hanyuan, to report on Ningxia's situation to the central government on behalf of Ma Hongkui (Central News Agency dispatch on the 30th).</p>
<h3>Xiao Zhenying Telegraphed the Battle Situation at the Front</h3>
<p>The 29th Army's office in Shanghai received a telegram from Mayor Xiao Zhenying, which stated (abridged): I arrived in Jinan on the morning of the 30th. All front-line troops are in fierce battles. Our front-line army is still firmly holding ××. Chairman Han's troops are deploying defenses. Commander Feng Yuxiang's younger brother's troops are engaged in fierce battles with the enemy and are responsible for covering the left flank to support frontal operations. I will meet with my younger brother tonight to discuss ways to reorganize the various routes for a counterattack. Please relay this to all parties. Xiao Zhenying (Central News Agency, 30th).</p>
<h3>Brief Commentary</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>For days, the enemy has been unable to use its skills because our army has built deep and high fortifications. They have resorted to bombing with aircraft and artillery. For example, the enemy artillery positions at a certain cemetery east of Yong'an Bridge bombed the Hu Residence, Zhu Residence, Gu Residence, and Liuhang areas along the Yunzaobang. From 5:00 AM on the 29th to 7:00 AM on the 30th, they fired continuously for twenty-six hours, launching over two thousand shells. However, our side only suffered over twenty soldiers killed or wounded. If we calculate the number of shells that hit their targets, for every hundred shells fired by the enemy, one of our soldiers is killed or wounded. It can be said that the enemy has a lot of artillery shells.</p>
<p>Of course, the enemy's ambition to invade our country has been brewing for a long time. Therefore, their preparations for manufacturing munitions must have been long-standing. Furthermore, the enemy has already made the decision to provoke a world war and take advantage of the chaos. Therefore, it is fitting that a country preparing for a world war has a sufficient supply of cannons and shells.</p>
<p>Also, I heard that in a certain place, enemy aircraft dropped over twenty bombs, and as a result, only one cow, one child, and two villagers were injured. It is regrettable that so many shells and bombs were wasted. A word to the enemy: please save them for later when you participate in the world war.</p>

<h3>Enemy Warships and Aircraft Attack Xiamen Four Times</h3>
<p>Enemy Warships Repelled by Xiamen Fortress Artillery.</p>
<p>Also Invading the Ports of Quanzhou and Yongning Township</p>
<p>Xiamen correspondence: After the Japanese and Taiwanese residents of Xiamen evacuated on August 28th, the Japanese consul stationed in Xiamen returned to his country on the same day, and Japanese warships left with him. Since then, enemy warships and aircraft have repeatedly invaded Xiamen. The circumstances are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>At 5:50 AM on September 3rd, four enemy warships—one cruiser, two destroyers, and one transport ship—launched a large-scale surprise attack on our port from outside Xiamen Port. The cruiser was in the center, flanked by the two destroyers, with the transport ship bringing up the rear. They sped forward at full speed. Our fortress artillery immediately raised a red flag to stop them. The enemy warships ignored it and fired at our fortress, attempting to break into the port. All fortress artillery then opened fire in unison. The artillery battle was extremely intense. Around 6:50 AM, the enemy warships were hit by three shells. The cruiser's stern was hit by two shells and caught fire, appearing to be severely damaged. One destroyer was hit by a shell on its side. They stopped advancing. The two destroyers quickly approached the cruiser to flank it, and together they towed the cruiser out of the port. Around 7:00 AM, an enemy fighter plane flew from Taiwan and circled over Xiamen City and the fortress area for more than half an hour. Then, two light bombers arrived, and the three planes jointly circled in the sky. Our anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns all opened fire to meet them. As a result, the enemy planes flew to an extreme altitude and dared not fly low. They started dropping bombs at 8:00 AM, but their aim was extremely inaccurate. They flew away at 9:30 AM. A total of eleven bombs were dropped inside and outside the city. While the enemy planes were dropping bombs, the enemy warships took the opportunity to try to break in again, leading to another artillery battle. At 10:00 AM, they retreated without success, and the alert was lifted. At 10:30 AM, the city returned to calm. At 1:30 PM, an enemy heavy bomber returned from Taiwan and dropped six or seven bombs in the fortress area. It retreated at 2:30 PM. In this battle, the enemy launched a combined sea and air attack. As a result, our side suffered no losses. Only one tile house in the city collapsed, killing a pregnant woman, and the nine-month-old fetus was also bombed out, a truly tragic sight. Another empty building had a hole blown in its roof, but the second-floor floorboards were still intact, and people still lived downstairs. On the night of the 4th, at 9:45 PM, another enemy plane flew over Xiamen Port. The city implemented a half-hour blackout. The blackout was lifted when the enemy plane had gone far away. At 8:35 AM on the 6th, there was another air raid warning. The enemy plane left after only five minutes. At 3:40 PM, two enemy light bombers attacked Xiamen again, circling for forty minutes. Because the anti-aircraft artillery and machine guns were firing so intensely, they were still inaccurate even when they dropped bombs. They left at 4:55 PM. The enemy planes dropped a total of eight bombs, one of which did not explode, but there were still no losses on the ground. Only one tile house collapsed, and an elderly man's foot was injured. At 5:45 AM on the 7th, two enemy light bombers attacked Xiamen for the third time, dropping four bombs in the suburban fortress area. They left at 6:40 AM without any losses. The city of Xiamen was exceptionally calm in the face of enemy warship and aircraft shelling and bombing. The police remained on duty in the streets, directing passersby and residents to take cover, without any fear. The order was very good. After the bombing, many women, children, and the elderly took refuge on Gulangyu and Heshan. However, by the second and third times, few people were fleeing. However, starting on the 4th, most of the businesses and shops in the city closed their doors and suspended operations. Only a small number of small shops remained open. By the 8th, 80-90% of the city's businesses had closed.</p>
<p>On the 14th, the enemy launched their fourth attack on Xiamen. At 7:50 AM on the morning, four enemy warships—one cruiser and three destroyers—suddenly entered Xiamen Port. Our outermost two fortress artillery again immediately raised a red flag to stop them. The enemy warships immediately fired artillery, and our artillery fired back. The artillery battle lasted until 9:10 AM. We finally repelled the enemy warships. The enemy warships fired more than thirty shells, and our artillery fired seven shells. The shells fired by our artillery all landed near the enemy warships, and the enemy warships retreated. It was rumored that one warship was also damaged. No enemy planes came that day. According to city rumors, the British ship Haitan, coming from Fuzhou, was protected by a British warship. It entered the port at 7:00 AM. Four Japanese warships intended to follow the British ship into the port, but our artillery fired to prevent them, and the artillery battle began. However, according to news from the British consulate, the British warship H22 went to Fuzhou on the 12th and returned to Xiamen on the morning of the 14th, entering the port before the Haitan and before the Japanese warship attack. The Haitan entered the port at 7:00 AM, while the Japanese warship shelling was closer to 8:00 AM. The shops in Xiamen City had been advised by the city government to resume operations on the 8th. By the 9th, some businesses had opened their doors. The number increased day by day. On the evening of the 13th, the Chamber of Commerce decided to inform all shops in the city to resume operations immediately. Those who hesitated would be charged with obstructing public order and severely punished by the authorities. On the morning of the 14th, the announcement was made by gong. Except for shops where the proprietor or employees had left and there was no one available to operate them, almost all shops resumed operations. On the morning of the enemy warship shelling, the citizens were calm and orderly. Shops opened as usual. It is expected that the situation will return to normal within days.</p>
<p>Enemy warships have been roaming the coastal areas of Fujian, with their whereabouts uncertain. Outside Xiamen Port, there have been at least one or two warships since the 3rd, and at most seven warships. They all left twice on the 8th and 11th. On the 13th, six warships returned. On the 14th, they launched an attack on Xiamen. On the same day, enemy warships shelled Yongning Port in Quanzhou. According to reports from Quanzhou, on the morning of the 14th, an enemy warship suddenly came to Yongning Township Port in the third district of Jinjiang County, outside the south gate of Quanzhou, and fired three shells at our military defenses. Then, an enemy warship led a small motorboat and sailing boats, attempting to land. However, because our defending army was well-prepared, the enemy was unable to succeed and retreated. At 5:00 PM, the enemy warship anchored in an important location in Yongning Port fired five more shells, all incendiary shells, mostly landing on the beach. Some old houses caught fire, but were quickly extinguished. A total of eight shells were fired at Yongning Township by enemy warships in the morning and afternoon. We suffered no losses, and the people were also calm. The enemy knew that there was no possibility of landing and deliberately shelled to disturb our people's morale. Yongning Township is an important town on the coast of southern Fujian, facing Taiwan across the strait. It also controls the hub of the Shanghai-Hong Kong shipping line. It has been an important naval base since the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, enemy warships attempted to harass it. Enemy warships seize fishing boats from fishermen encountered while fishing along the coast, and bind and interrogate fishermen on the islands, demanding rice and food for ransom. The fishermen have been severely trampled upon and are filled with deep hatred.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Reconnoiter Nantong</h3>
<p>Enemy Landing Has Not Succeeded</p>
<p>Nantong correspondence: The counties under the jurisdiction of Tongzhou have been repeatedly invaded by enemy warships and aircraft because they are adjacent to the Shanghai-Songjiang war zone. Since September 19th, the enemy's flames have been burning even more intensely, with air raids day and night, reaching six or seven times a day. Each time, there have been anywhere from three to over ten enemy aircraft, all reconnoitering along the river and sea. The local damage has been light. Tongzhou has the widest river surface, and there are also many shoals and reefs. The enemy warships use sand ships as a vanguard, in groups of four or five, repeatedly firing at the shore. However, most of the shells land in the countryside, killing or wounding more than a dozen people. But once our stationed troops retaliate, the enemy warships immediately retreat downstream. The river water was low last month, with extensive shallow beaches, making it difficult for the enemy to succeed in their attempts to land. The Lusi, Fengli, and Juegang fishing grounds on the Yellow Sea coast have been completely closed to fishing boats to prevent the activities of traitors. Tongzhou has had a good cotton harvest this year, but there is no market in Shanghai and the cotton is only being purchased by local factories. The price of cotton has fallen to only twelve yuan per picul. As for local Jiangbei goods, such as fresh pork, chicken, and duck, they used to be sold in Jiangnan, but since the outbreak of the war, they have flooded the market, and the prices are incredibly cheap. Eggs are only thirty cash each, and there is still an oversupply. All large, medium, and small schools in the city have not been able to open. Schools in rural areas are still holding classes as usual. The county government and various bureaus are practicing joint office management, divided into civil, training, police, guard, rescue, and engineering groups, with the county magistrate exercising centralized authority. The local court has been ordered to implement austerity measures, and two-thirds of the judges, prosecutors, clerks, recorders, bailiffs, and process servers have been laid off with suspended pay.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>People's Committee Holds Meeting</p>
<p>The People's Organization Committee of this county held its fourth meeting at the county Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on the 27th. All committee members, including Lu Shulian, attended. They resolved to appoint the heads of the working groups of each division and discussed a number of cases.</p>
<p>Suspected Traitor Escorted to Jiashan</p>
<p>Yu Weigeng of the Daguanming News, a resident of this county, was arrested by the county police bureau on suspicion of being a traitor. He was escorted to Jiashan by police officers sent by the district headquarters to be tried.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Outbreak of Plague in the City and Countryside</p>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, the weather in Wuxi has been abnormal, leading to the spread of epidemics. Yesterday alone, more than thirty people inside and outside the city contracted the plague and were sent to various hospitals to receive saline injections and treatment. The spread in the countryside is even more severe. In Wujiadang in the ninth district, more than ten people have died after the discovery of genuine cholera a few days ago. Many cases have also occurred in Beiqifang, Yuqi, and other places, and the situation is very rampant. There is a shortage of hospitals in the countryside, so deaths continue to occur one after another.</p>
<p>Traitor Apprehended at Reception Center</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Yiyong Zhuangding team apprehended a traitor at the Tonghui Bridge Refugee Reception Center and found a Rising Sun flag on his person. The witness was taken to the team for preliminary questioning and then transferred to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Confiscation of Illegally Transported Rice</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, the authorities seized twelve rice boats in Mocheng that were illegally transporting rice, carrying over 2,500 dan of rice. Upon inspection, no rice transport permits were found, and it was only known that they were heading to Shanghai. The authorities suspected that, during this time of tense war, it could be aiding the enemy or that it could be seized by the enemy. Therefore, it was immediately detained. After discussion, it was decided that because it violated the regulations prohibiting rice from leaving the territory and had no permits, which was obviously untrue, the rice would be confiscated and handed over to the public association for auction at a price of 9 yuan and 7 jiao per dan. Two weeks after the incident, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce wired the county to release the rice to regulate the food supply for the Shanghai citizens. At that time, there was a shortage of fried rice at the front, so the confiscated rice was distributed to various households for frying, bagged, and sent to the front. Therefore, the rice has been completely disposed of. The request from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce cannot be fulfilled. It was learned here that the rice belonged to Lu Rusheng of the Gongxing Rice Mill in this area. There were definitely untruths in the matter. A similar discovery was made during the January 28th Incident. Lu has disappeared and the county government is issuing a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Strafe Fushan</p>
<p>Enemy planes have been bombing the capital and Jiangyin for days. This area is a necessary route, so the sound of planes is constant all day long. Air raid alarms are sounded more than ten times a day. Residents are accustomed to it and no longer find it strange. However, at 1:00 PM on the 25th, when enemy planes passed over Fushan, they strafed with dozens of machine gun rounds. Since there was no target, no damage was caused. On the same day, at 5:00 PM, three enemy planes passed over the Lake Bridge in Xishan. There were three or four small tugboats loaded with gravel. The planes also fired machine guns, but the bullets fell into the lake and caused no damage. The citizens are extremely calm and the authorities have ordered all businesses to reopen within three days. Starting from the 26th, the police will go door-to-door to encourage them. Ships traveling to and from Su-Chang and Xi-Chang have also resumed, making transportation convenient. However, there are not many passengers.</p>
<h3>American Nationals from Qingdao and Yantai Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Bound for Hong Kong and Manila this Morning</p>
<p>The U.S. transport ship "Chaumont," which departed from Qingdao a few days ago and sailed to Shanghai, arrived at the port at 9:15 AM yesterday and docked at the U.S. Navy Wharf on the French Bund. The ship carried 500 American women and children from Qingdao and Yantai and is scheduled to load another 120 Americans from Moganshan who are coming to Shanghai. It will sail to Hong Kong at 9:00 AM this morning and then proceed to Manila.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Specialized Department to Assess Fineness</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver Ornaments Exchanged for Public Bonds - Absolutely No Undervaluation</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since China launched a full-scale war of resistance, the soldiers at the front have bravely fought the enemy, and the people in the rear have enthusiastically contributed. What is particularly commendable is that women have been donating gold bracelets, rings, and other items, either to purchase national salvation bonds or to contribute to the government. This spirit is an essential element of the long-term war of resistance and should be vigorously promoted. However, I recently read in a newspaper that a certain bank was undervaluing or refusing to accept donated gold and silver items. The reporter believes that if this is the case, it will affect the future of the war of resistance. I took a car to visit a gentleman familiar with the inside story of finance to investigate. According to him, the valuation of gold and silver items is a specialized skill, and bank tellers do not have this expertise. Therefore, banks collect gold and silver items and all handle them by transferring personnel from the gold and silver jewelry industry, which is by no means a complete monopoly. On the bank's side, for those who purchase national salvation bonds with gold and silver items, they rely entirely on the valuer's valuation. Therefore, the claim of undervaluing is unfounded. All ornaments received are stored in the bank, with receipts and detailed accounts as proof. There has never been a case of reselling to others or melting. For the sake of encouraging donations, the government also adds 6% to the valuation and issues national salvation bond receipts. Recently, it has been heard that people are also freely donating gold and silver ornaments. The bank also instructs valuers to assess the fineness and exchange them for legal tender, so that donors can take it to the donation receiving organization to facilitate the process. However, at the beginning, perhaps due to the lack of manpower and the enthusiastic donors, processing was difficult to expedite. It is now heard that the Central Bank has consulted with the gold and silver jewelry trade association in this city to select several people who are proficient in identifying the fineness of gold and silver every day to set up a special department to meet the public's desire. A notice has been issued yesterday. I sincerely hope that other entrusted banks can also improve their operations in order to jointly overcome national difficulties and save this critical situation.</p>

<h3>The Tragic Demise of a Family Bombed to Death by Enemy Planes, a Suicide by Jumping into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Witnessed by Foreigners Leaning on Railings - The River Weeps as It Flows East</p>
<p>According to the English-language "The China Press", on Wednesday evening at 6:00 PM, a private yacht was moored in the Huangpu River at the end of Renji Road. A small group of foreigners on board were chatting idly on the railing, or relaxing on the deck, dancing to music broadcasted by the radio. Several Japanese planes were bombing the Pudong sky at sunset. A foreigner on board suddenly saw a Chinese man on the Nanjing Road wharf throw himself into the river. At that time, there were still quite a few people on the wharf, but there was no disturbance. The foreigner did not pay much attention to it, only seeing the person who jumped into the water emerge from the surface twice, before finally disappearing into the waves. He then told the others on the ship about it, and the people on the wharf only stared at the water, without any movement. Therefore, he sent the yacht's captain to inquire. Soon after, he returned and said that the man had committed suicide because his family and relatives had all been killed in the bombing by Japanese planes. The man had told the people on the wharf about his experience. The people did not initially expect that he would take such a short-sighted action. When they saw him jump into the water, they felt that even if they could save him, it would only prolong his pain. The foreigners on board were overwhelmed with sighs and ordered the captain and others to use long poles to try to retrieve the body, but the river was very rapid, and the twilight was fading. After a long time, there was no result. At this time, the people on the riverbank dispersed. Only the lights of the Bund shone, and occasionally one or two buses or trams passed by. The black water in the river flowed eastward, seemingly weeping to mourn the dead.</p>
<h3>First Aid Kits</h3>
<p>Still Hope for Mass Donations</p>
<p>Wartime soldiers inevitably shed blood, so first aid kits are urgently needed. The Shanghai Relief Committee urgently hopes that people from all walks of life will donate generously. Each pack costs 1 jiao in national currency, and they are sold in all pharmacies. Each pack contains four items stipulated by the Military Medical Department: medicinal cotton, medicinal gauze, mercuric chloride gauze, and pain relief tablets. If an individual or business group donates more than 10,000 packs, they can entrust the Sino-Western Pharmacy on Fourth Road to print the name of the donor for commemoration.</p>
<h3>Local Associations Send Personnel to Collect Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>Since the Local Association on the fourth floor of the China United Building, together with the Relief Committee, launched a campaign to collect 200,000 cotton vests, nearly 20,000 have been received, and more than 20,000 have been ordered but not yet collected. Now that the weather is getting colder and the soldiers at the front need them urgently, in addition to sending out the ones that have been received and urging the ones that have been ordered to be completed as soon as possible, we sincerely hope that enthusiastic compatriots from all walks of life will make more of them. The patterns can be obtained from the association or the Relief Committee on the third floor of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. After they are made, if there are more than ten pieces and it is inconvenient to deliver them, you can use a phone call or a letter to notify the association, and they will send personnel with receipts to collect them. The association's phone numbers are 84844 and 83964. In addition, the association is currently soliciting manufacturers of Guangbing (crisp baked cakes). Those who can produce more than 10,000 pieces per day can contact the association.</p>
<h3>Receiving Wounded Soldiers in the Concession</h3>
<p>According to reports received by the Public Works Department, there are still 202 empty beds in the Public Concession Wounded Soldiers Hospital, which can be used for wounded soldiers.</p>
<h3>Brief News Roundup</h3>
<p>The Children's National Salvation Association and the Anti-Japanese Art Exhibition have selected a small portion of children's national salvation cartoons, which will be exhibited at the Lake Society starting today.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhu Shaoyun, a Suzhou scrofula specialist, at No. 3 Yongnian Lane, Baike Road, this city, is still seeing patients as usual during the national crisis. He only charges refugee compatriots 1 jiao for registration. Clinic hours are from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM, and house calls are from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Phone number: 36221. Yin Mubo, a gynecological specialist from the Tianzu Temple, has now moved to No. 130 east of Jinsitu Temple, Kangnao Road. He sees patients here from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM at the Tianhetang Pharmacy in Lisan Jiao Chang, Caojiadu. "Social Evening News" has been published for four years and has a wide circulation. The newspaper has moved into a new building at No. 223 Shandong Road, because the original location was insufficient. The Public Works Department has issued a notice informing Chinese and foreign residents who wish to be vaccinated but cannot afford a doctor to go to the department's various hygiene branches for vaccination during office hours (except Sundays). If employers want to ask the department to vaccinate a large number of their workers, please notify them in writing or by phone (12410, extension 23).</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Amateur Association, at No. 5, Lane 542, Avenue Joffre, Shanghai, has begun to investigate and compile "The Directory of Temporary Offices of Shanghai Chinese Banks" due to the fact that Chinese commercial banks have moved to temporary offices to ensure the safety of customers after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, making it difficult to find out the addresses and telephone numbers of each bank. Two copies are distributed to each bank for application. If there is any need in all circles, please attach 2 cents in postage and it will be sent.</p>
<h3>After the Zhengfeng College of Liberal Arts Was Bombed</h3>
<p>Materials Can Be Destroyed, but Spirit Cannot Be Extinguished</p>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) The Zhengfeng College of Liberal Arts, west of Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, was unfortunately bombed by enemy planes at 5:00 PM on the 23rd of this month. The college is the highest institution of national studies in Shanghai. Looking at other universities in the country, although they also have colleges of liberal arts, only the Wuxi National Studies College and this college are dedicated to promoting national studies. It is unfortunate that it has now been destroyed by enemy planes, which is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>The reporter inspected the college yesterday and saw that the iron gate was tightly closed. It took a long time to call out a gatekeeper. Walking along an open-air passage, the flowers and trees on both sides were still lush and lovely, and there was no sign that the college had been tragically robbed. Then, from the main entrance of the office building, turning into the classrooms and dormitories, the scene was completely different. Skylights were open, and rubble was everywhere, making it unbearable to look at. According to the gatekeeper, "Since the college is close to the battlefield, all the staff and students, except for the gatekeeper, have been evacuated." Moreover, although the college is located close to the battlefield, it is actually in a vast green field. Such a quiet, remote, and unarmed school could not escape the clutches of the enemy army. This is undoubtedly another ironclad proof that Japanese imperialism is intentionally destroying our cultural institutions.</p>
<p>In order to further explore the history of the Zhengfeng College of Liberal Arts and the aftermath of the bombing, I interviewed the president of the college, Mr. Wang Xishen, who kindly received me and answered the following questions.</p>
<p>"The establishment and development of the college, from middle school to college, has spanned more than ten years. The current school building was built in 1934, costing more than 200,000 yuan. It has a Department of Chinese Literature and a Department of National Studies. The professors in each department are experts in national studies, such as Hu Puan, Yao Minghui, Zhu Xiangwan, Chen Yantong, etc. There are hundreds of students, and many graduates serve in political and academic circles. Relatively speaking, they can all get general approval.</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, the college suffered great losses, and its vitality has not yet been restored. Since the outbreak of this war, Shanghai universities have been damaged, but the college has only been affected by stray bullets, and there has been no major loss. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, enemy planes hovered in the sky for a long time, targeting the college and frequently dropping bombs, destroying the first, fourth, and sixth classrooms, the New Life Movement Room, the military instructor's office, and the reading room. The enemy's vicious means of destroying our cultural institutions are all-encompassing, which is very hateful.</p>
<p>However, national essence is the foundation of the country. At this time of survival, we must strive to move forward. We firmly believe that materials can be destroyed, but spirit cannot be extinguished. We originally planned to expand in various ways this semester. Although we have suffered this setback, we must work harder to carry it out and restore it in a short period of time. We have temporarily borrowed the Daotong Girls' School at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Haig as a temporary school building and are scheduled to start classes on the 11th of next month (October)."</p>
<p>Although Mr. Wang often revealed regret and hatred in his words when talking about the above situation, he was very firm in his determination and attitude to revive the college. Indeed, materials can be destroyed, but spirit cannot be extinguished. With Mr. Wang's past hard work in operating the college, coupled with his determination to move forward after being stimulated this time, it is predicted that the time when the college will hold a grand restoration ceremony will soon coincide with the victory of the war of resistance.
