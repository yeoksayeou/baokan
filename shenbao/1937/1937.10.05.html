<h3>敵機昨又四出肆虐</h3>
<p>敵機二十餘架、昨仍不斷肆虐在江灣·大塲·閘北·麥根路車站·北新涇·眞如·南翔·各處盤旋不已、投彈甚多、我平民罹難者不少、尤以北新涇·眞如·兩處在田間工作及担荷入市之鄉民、為敵機軋軋之聲、驚擾不已、</p>

<p>上午十一時從上海出發、告別了高樓重重的都市、進入一片綠色的曠野、必頭是充滿着興奮和愉快的感情、</p>
<p>公路的兩旁、都是種植棉花的田野、枯黃的葉、碧綠的枝、朶朶雪白的花、點綴着這一望無涯的田野、農婦和孩子們灣着腰在採棉、她們的丈夫和他們的父親、都在為着駐在的軍隊服務、在全國動員的今日　廣大的農民、决不是例外、</p>
<p>在途中、兩次遇着敵機、正在不遠的地方轟炸、採棉的農婦和孩子們、都停止了工作、伏在地上、我也下了車到田間去躱避、往返奔走了半天、直到傍晚、才到達了目的地、從今晚開始、我就過着軍隊的生活了、</p>
<p>九月二十九日</p>
<p>昨天晚上、在隆隆的砲聲之中、四周唧唧的蟲聲從墻外傳來、引起了我童年的回憶、在十七年前、這些各種不同的蟲聲、我能知道這是什麽、那又是什麽、是的、我離開了我的故鄉已經有十七年了、這十七年烟似的很快的消逝了、然而在這似乎很短促的十七年之中、我們是受盡了敵人的凌辱、現在呢、我們已經站起來了、全面的抗戰、已經開始了、我們是下了决心要把敵人逐出國門之外、</p>
<p>從早晨六點鐘到十一點鐘、敵機不斷在江灣·廟行·和閘北一帶轟炸、在沉重的炸彈爆裂聲中、稀疏地間着輕快的機關砲聲、不斷地打動着耳膜、簡直沒有十分鐘的甯靜、</p>
<p>從軍事長官的口中、知道敵機轟炸的結果、除了人民受到相當損失之外、我們軍事上並無損害、在這焦土抗戰之中、我們大家都决不希望倖免的、敵人的炸彈、祇在我們心中種下了深刻的仇恨而已、這些仇恨爆發的力量、也許就是我們抗戰最後勝利的力量、</p>
<p>今天晤見了好幾位高級軍事長官、他們對於戰事都很樂觀、並目有着十二分的信心和把握、因為敵人惟一的利器、便是大砲和飛機、當敵人砲擊或轟炸的時候、我們的部隊、都能很安全地躱避因此敵人的大砲和飛機、也就失去了效能、至於敵人的步兵呢、這簡直是百戰百輸的常輸將軍、我們祇要能够見了敵人的面、那準把他們殺得落花流水、所謂武士道大和魂之“皇軍”也者、簡直不敢輕易在我們的陣地之前露臉、在這種情况之下、敵人即欲求尺寸之進也决非易事、</p>
<p>砲擊又在黑暗的空間開始了、但沒有昨晚那麽密集、大約砲聲將成為我們每天晚上的催眠曲了、</p>
<p>九月三十日</p>
<p>今天早晨五點半鐘醒來、就聽到了警報今天敵機雖會數度在我們陣地的上空出現、但不久即行他飛、總算過了很平靜的一天、</p>
<p>上午天氣很好、送出一批戰報回上海、但是祗隔十五分鐘、天就下雨了、我總記掛着戰報能否安全地到達上海、直到晚上從電話中知道已安全到達、這才放下心來、</p>
<p>下午砲聲又斷續地響着、直到晚上還沒有停止、據高級軍事長官說、敵人砲擊的唯一的目的、僅為擾亂我陣地後方而已、昨天晚上當敵人發砲很密的時候、我們的砲兵也集中了砲火、向敵人的砲兵陣地轟擊、先後發砲幾達百發、敵人的砲聲立刻停止下來、料想敵人定必受了相當的損害、</p>
<p>在軍中、小飛機（蒼蠅和蚊虫）之多、多得簡直使安居在租界裹的人們所意想不到的、在白天、蒼蠅成鞏結隊的騷擾、膽敢老是停留在人們的臉上、揮之即去、去而復來在晚間、是蚊虫肆威的時候了、到處向人進襲使你別想安靜地寫一個字、這些小飛機之使人討厭、簡直和敵機一樣、躱進棉被中去吧、為了避免小飛機的襲擊、雖然現在還只八點半鐘、</p>
<p>十月一日</p>
<p>昨天整晚的砲擊、今天又是整天的轟作、這似乎是敵人唯一的威力了、然而又有什麽效力呢、據各綫的報告、敵人連日雖然猛烈地砲擊、猛烈地轟炸、但是迄無大隊的敵人來犯、在戰塲上欲求進展、總需要步兵的衝擊、敵人的步兵旣如此膽怯無用、那麽整天的轟炸和整晚的砲擊、也只徒耗彈藥、又有何用、我們前綫的將士都已等待了好幾大了、等待着痛快地厮殺一塲、</p>
<p>從今晨拂曉直到傍晚、軋軋的機聲、間着沉重的爆炸聲和輕快的機槍聲、整天攪擾着沒有片刻的寧靜、雖然警報繁忙地響着房屋劇烈地震動、但是大家都安靜地照常工作、地下室裹冷淸淸的找不到一個人。</p>
<p>午刻得到報告、江灣正面的敵人的陣地、後撒約千餘公尺、同時並有大隊的敵人、分向楊樹浦及吳淞方面撤退、大家聽了這個消息、都很高興、因為過去幾天、敵人集中兵力在市中心區一帶、企圖突破我江灣之綫、自經我軍迎頭痛擊、敵人的夢想已經粉碎、現在不得不撤退以圖他進、據一位高級軍官告訴我、現在淞滬方面的戰事完全是陣地戰、我軍穩扎穩打、步步為營、敵人企圖突破我任何一點、均屬夢想、</p>
<p>砲聲又響了、我眞為日本國民的血汗憐惜、</p>
<p>十月二日</p>
<p>今天敵機雖然照常的活動、但沒有昨天那麽繁忙、閘北及江灣方面之前綫、也頗沉寂、</p>
<p>午後看到很多戰利品、是在上月二十七日晚間八時半、敵向我三民路以南之季家灣陣地進犯、當經我軍迎頭予以痛擊敵狼狽向李家宅方面潰退、遺屍多具其中有一係敵第三師團第六聯隊第一中隊之上士川松與津次、並獲戰利品甚多、計有川上中隊長名章一件、山下小隊長名章一件、上肩領章各一件、十一師團油印臘紙一張、品目實數表一份通報一張、銅牌一塊、受領證及郵寄證各一張、宣傳品三張、通信紙一本、黑色手册一本、支隊會報紀錄二張、第一中隊編成表一份、日洋二百二十八元、鳥毛一包、家信一封、</p>
<p>在上述許多戰利品之中、宣傳品三張、都印着什麽“日本精神贊美之詩”、通信紙一本、是記着命令和詳報等項、黑色手册是敵軍曹川松與津次的日記、上面記着九月十六日登輪出發、十七日由吳淞登岸、後來先後調駐音樂學校、上海公墓、尤家巷、及李家宅等處、支隊會報紀錄兩張、說是軍隊中已發生傳染病、並指示士兵應如何防疫、及陣地應如何淸潔等等、第一中隊編成表上、載明每中隊分三小隊每小隊分六班、每班十三人至十四人、全中隊約計二百五上餘人、日洋二百二十八元已經發給首功部隊作為獎金、至於烏毛一包、則不知有何用處、此外在川松與津次身上所搜得的家書一封、是九有十六日書就、寄往“日本香（？）川縣香（？）川郡（？）直京（？）村銀煉所”、交給他的家屬的、但他不該不寫好了馬上就發出、以致永遠不能遞到了、信是寫在“江灣桃園”包桃子的紙上、兩張薄薄的紙、中間印着紅色的桃子和“江灣桃園”等字樣四遍空白處都密密地寫滿了字、現在把信的內容譯在下面、“自十六日上船之後即如牛之入欄　絕無自由、登岸後、但聞槍砲之聲、日夜不絕、目時有孟彈飛來　上海大氣漸冷、惟蚊蠅仍多、此間旣無蚊賬、又無法人浴、殊為痛苦、日來天時降雨積水沒踁更以時刻準備應戰靴不離脚、夜不能眠、疲勞達於極點、此間民家絕無一人、十室之內、焚毀者達六七、軍中飯食、發生因難、飲水尤感缺乏、現與華軍相距約七百米但見村落之中、散兵壕蜿蜒不絕、敵軍行動隱約可見、柳生及其他友人、登岸之後、絕未見面、同殺來者、戰死甚多、傷者尤夥、余之生命如何、則惟天神知之、別矣、珍重、切望善自保養、子女敎育、尤不可忽、”（待續）</p>

<h3>希望全世界在經濟上抵制日本</h3>
<p>— 金仲華</p>
<p>在日帝國主義用了它全部的武力、侵略我士地，屠殺我平民，毀壞我一切文化建築的時候，在世界各國，已經引起了一片激怒抗議的聲浪；許許多多的報紙刋物，一致詆斥日帝國主義的侵略暴行；無數無數的正義人士，都起來反對日帝國主義的兇殘屠殺。現在這種反對與抗議，已經迅速地表現爲具體的行動，大家不買日貨，大家不賣貨物給日本，許多工人自動起來拒絕裝運軍火原料給日本，這個在經濟上抵制日本侵略者的運動，目前正在澎湃發展，成爲全世界反對日帝國主義的一個巨流。人類的同情力量究竟是偉大的。國際間正義感的爆發，到底是可以衝破一切界限的。我們在感奮之餘，對於全世界熱情援助我國的人士，還想進一步說幾句話。</p>
<p>我們要吿訴全世界的正義人士，目前正在發動展開中的經濟抵制運動，是可以阻止日帝國主義的浸略野心的。但是這個抵制運動應當更求其推廣，更求其深入。最好是各國政府也能夠殺然决定，一致在經濟上拒絕給與日本軍閥以援助，直到他們的侵略行爲終止了而俊已。在目前展開着的經濟抵制運動中，似乎有人說，國聯對於意大利的細濟制裁，結果曾歸於失敗。但我們要指出，對意制裁的失敗，正因爲這個經濟制裁的計劃，沒有徹底施行的緣故。現在祗要能夠澈底的抵制日本，把鋼鐵和石油都拒絕給興日本，它的侵略力量就會大大的受到打擊的。也似乎有人說，要澈底的抵制日本，就不免有和它發生武裝衝突的可能，但這顯然是一種過慮。祗有各國繼續在經濟上幫助日本，才會把它的侵略野心無限擴大起來。而全世界的實行經濟抵制，乃是迅速消减日本的侵略野心，使它不致把武力擴展到其他各國的最好方法。</p>
<p>下列的一些統計材料，可以帮助大家明白經濟的抵制對於日本軍閥打擊的嚴重，近幾年來，日本軍閣爲了凖備向中國大舉侵略，爲了凖備向全世界挑戰，曾經提出了所謂﹁凖戰時體制﹂的計創，向國外拚命收買戰爭原料，大批大批的碎鋼廢鐵，從香港，馬來亞，美洲等處收買了去。在日本營業的英美石油商，曾經被追必須有六個月石油的貯藏。最近三年中，一九三四年一月到十月，日本所輸入的軍火原料及半製品，價値一·四七八·百萬圓；一九三五年同時期。就增加到一六○五百萬圓。一九三六年同時期，又增加到一·八○七百萬圓。爲了不斷增加軍火原料的輸入，日本又拚命把它的棉織品廉價傾銷，擾亂世界的市場。但由於這樣的擴充軍備日本侵略者的財庫已經非常空虛。目前它的現金凖備，比一九二七年已减少二倍。它的預算虧空每年達到八萬萬圓。它的公債額也已達一二·○○○百萬圓。現在日帝國主義已把它戰爭的輪子，更加速的推動了。它的經濟上的危機，自然將益增嚴重。在這時候，只有國際上的經濟封鎖，可以消滅它的侵略野心。假使現在縱容了它，則它的瘋狂侵略的步驟，必將四面的亂闖開來。</p>
<p>一個日本作家有澤廣已曾經説過，日本最怕戰時的原料封鎖。因爲在二十二種主要的戰爭原料中，有九種日本祇能保障百分之五，卽鉛個·棉·鋅·樹膠·鎳·羊毛·鉀·及水銀。有四種祇能保障百分之十到二十五，卽石油·鋁·磷·及錫。有三種可保障百分之四十到七十，卽鐵·錳及窒素。另有六種可保障百分之九十到一百，卽煤·硫磺·鋼·重石及雲母。從這統計·來。可以知道網鐵和石油這兩種最基本的戰時原料，日本都非常缺少。現在它雖可以利用近年貯積下的軍火和原料，向中國大肆屠殺。但只要全世界能夠在經濟上封鎖日本，它的瘋狂屠殺的政策，就不會支持到多久的。</p>
<p>在上月一隻日本輪船在美國裝運廢鐵的時候，有人向碼頭工人演說，說：﹁這些廢鐵今天是裝到日本，製成子彈，去射殺中國民衆的。但是在明天，這些子彈將被用來射殺美國的民衆了。﹂這段有意思的話，是値得大家注意的。在今天，我們已在抵抗日本的侵略了。而在今日帮助了我們，也就是防止明天日本對於全世界的挑戰。</p>

<h3>徵求軍用物品</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>在這次大規模的現代戰爭中間。我軍表現着制勝的幾項基本條件。就是布置周密。行動敏捷。紀律嚴明。士氣旺盛。這不僅已使敵人駭懼。而各友邦人士也在一致的稱道了。</p>
<p>可是我們不必諱言。我軍的物質條件。跟敵人相比。還是非常艱苦的。我軍事當局對於各動員部隊的供應雖早有周妥的凖備。但在戰事進行中間由於種種意外的原因。軍需品的配布。終究不能無“緩不濟急”“求過於供”之感。因此戰區附近的民衆對於前方作戰的隊伍。隨時在物質上予以儘量的接濟。實有絕對的必要。</p>
<p>最近本報記者從前方探得。目前正在英勇作戰的某部。對於若干項物品。極感需要。特在報端代為向市民方面徵集。（見第六版新聞）深望本埠同胞明瞭援助軍隊的責任。踴躍捐助。由負責機關。運往前方。以利軍事。</p>

<h3>羅店以西有血戰敵我仍在施相公廟相持</h3>
<p>敵主力猛犯廣福鎮被擊潰　蕰藻浜南岸我有堅固工事　閘北炮戰劇烈我陣線不動</p>
<p>連日敵以重兵猛犯我閘北陣地、圖切斷我江灣連絡、以達其速戰速决目的、我軍本利于巷戰、敵僅恃坦克車掩護、我軍藉房屋之掩蔽、居高臨下、頻以機關槍手溜彈射擊、敵遺屍纍纍、始終未能越我陣綫一步、某外籍軍事家曾于某處目睹我忠勇士卒殺敵如麻、歸後讚美不絕、謂我軍智勇兼全、閘北銅藏鐵壁、非敵所能輕易染指也云、本報今日下午二時所獲前方消息如下、㊀羅店方面、敵以二聯隊以上之兵力、分路攻我新陣地、我軍沉着應戰、敵屢進屢敗、終不得逞、刻仍、在施相公廟對峙中、敵飛機大砲之轟擊、幾無片刻之停歇、但我陣地屹然不動、㊁羅店劉行間之廣福鎭、敵集中進犯、先後被我擊退、敵死亡奇重、㊂劉行顧家宅以南之戰事側重在蕰藻浜附近、我軍在浜南築有極堅固之防禦工事、敵欲偷渡絕不可能、㊃大場廟行等處、今晨敵機又肆行投彈、我陣地亳無損害、㊄閘北方面、敵進犯已受嚴重打擊、今晨敵大部隊、似已無力再攻雖小隊不時騷擾、于戰局無關、我陣地絕無變動、敵飛機大砲、今晨拂曉起、不絕轟擊我閘北陣地、我重砲亦予還擊、砲戰迄午未停、</p>

<h3>羅店劉行戰况激烈</h3>
<p>敵犯我廣福東陣地未逞　沈家灣吳家宅敵受重創</p>
<p>羅店至劉行以迄蘊藻浜一綫、敵以苦戰累月、傷亡慘重、遂不得不抽調駐防市中心區之兵力、向該方面補充、以圖撑持、故前昨兩日、敵不分晝夜、利用飛機大砲、向我劉行方面陣地、不斷集中轟擊、致我一部份工事、被其損壞、我軍現在廣福鎮一帶陣地固守、劉行方面昨夜今晨敵由新木橋·張家宅一帶向找廣福鎭東面陣地數度猛攻、均經我以極猛烈之火力、將其擊退、敵傷亡奇重、至羅店方面施相公廟一帶陣綫、我敵仍對峙中、惟自昨晚起、敵以精銳部隊一大隊在坦克車大砲掩護之下、由沈家灣吳家宅向我陣地猛撲、我軍沈着應戰、待敵逼近相當距離時、我軍均由戰壕躍出、猛衝肉搏、敵之坦克車在我手溜彈及小鋼砲集中猛轟之下、均失其效用、激戰竟夜迄至今晨止、我軍陣地仍屹然未動、敵遺屍纍纍、傷亡極衆、至蘊藻浜以北之敵、將在浜南亟圖偷渡、但我該方面陣地極固、敵决難得逞、</p>
<h3>閘江灣均有砲戰</h3>
<p>三日來敵方損失奇重　江灣陸家角敵受大挫</p>
<p>閘北方面、連日戰事劇烈、夜以繼日、未嘗間斷、昨晚迄今晨、我敵兩軍、不時砲戰、而步槍機關槍亦斷績可聞、寶山路及北四川路附近、亦有激戰、槍砲聲通夜未停、今晨六時起浦江敵艦向北站方面開砲、我亦還擊、六時至十時間、北站與麥根路車站間之一段、砲戰猛烈、北四川路日本小學之敵營、被我砲彈擊中、損失頗重、據某軍事家云、三日間敵步兵因衝鋒而犧牲於我機槍手溜彈下者、不下千餘人、我方所受敵軍重砲飛機之轟炸、雖亦有損失然多屬於民衆之房屋、與軍事上並無絲亳損害、所以我軍陣綫非惟未曾動搖、且屢被我軍衝過敵軍陳地、因此敵步兵一見我軍出壕應戰、無不戰憟後退、某君復出今晨敵機在天空飛散之謊謬傳單一紙、上有種種插畫等、我軍民心如鐵石、無論如何非達到殲滅敵衆决不休止、又截至午後一時止、敵機尚在猛力轟炸、隆隆之聲、全滬震聞、今晨拂曉、江灣方面之敵約一中隊、由陸家角附近蠢動、向葉園我軍陣地進攻、先以機槍猛射、見我軍亳無動靜、卽匍匐而前、約距三百公尺時、我大隊戰士、出壕衝殺、聲勢浩大、激戰兩小時、敵傷亡過半、餘衆鬨志已失、卽倉皇潰退、遍地屍首、狠狽萬狀、我軍追踪至陸家角左近、始從容歸隊、</p>
<h3>敵巨型機投彈閘北</h3>
<p>上午十一時半、敵巨型重轟炸機兩隊、共六架、至閘北一帶、投擲炸彈、濫肆轟炸、一隊在北站上空拋擲十餘彈、一隊則似在寶山路之東北、亦投數十彈、爆發之聲甚巨、我軍鎮靜如恒、至十二時三刻、北站方面之敵機一隊、經我方施放高射砲後、卽向東駛去、</p>
<p>大公社云、今日上午九時五十分、敵軍在瀏河方面、忽放一黑色巨大汽球、高達天空三千餘公尺、記者曾在外灘某高大建築物屋頂、用最精確之望遠鏡觀之、見該汽球成一橄欖形、下縣一皮椅、有三人乘座其間、椅下有一長繩、直垂於地、而三人中有一人着白色制服者、似在用某項電訊工具與地下敵軍通話、狀殊忙迫、此外二人亦各持望遠鏡向四週瞭望、似在偵察各地情形、直至十一時許、仍未降下、自滬戰發生以來、歷將二月、敵軍之使用汽球、此尚為第一次、於此可見敵軍之計窮力竭也云、並據某軍事家觀察、敵軍此次使用最近科學戰爭工具之目的、純係在偵察我軍陣地、並給予敵軍以轟擊目的、此外殊無其他重大作用云、</p>
<h3>敵機慘殺婦孺農民</h3>
<p>大塲眞茹炸死二十餘人</p>
<p>昨日微明起、敵機五十餘架、又徘徊我大塲、眞茹一带、轟炸非戰鬥員、在大塲一處、投三十餘彈、死平民二十餘人、均為婦孺老幼、在田野間採摘棉花、及刈割穀稻者、敵機卽投以大量炸彈、</p>
<h3>敵運艦載軍火到滬</h3>
<p>停泊招商局北棧起卸</p>
<p>中央社云、連日來陸續駛滬之敵商輸改建之運輸艦、除神佑丸依然停泊十六號浮筒、羽黑丸明元丸停靠黃浦碼頭、生田丸停靠招商局中棧、尚因載來軍火未全卸竣、迄未駛出、其餘若昨日駛到之興安丸春晴丸、丰川丸等運輸艦、則已於昨晚相繼駛出淞口返日、至本日（五日）上午、僅有Chimiy號運輸艦一艘、滿載軍火彈械駛到、停泊招商局北棧、刻正在陸續起卸中云、</p>
<h3>敵軍盜我民有則物</h3>
<p>楊樹浦區內搬運一空</p>
<p>中央社云、自滬戰爆發、虹口楊樹浦一帶、陷入火綫、該區域城內工廠林立、居戶昆連、商業亦極繁盛乃以禍起倉卒、故不論住戶工廠商店一切物件、均未及運出，日前各該區曾一度開放、任外籍人士入內搬運物伴、據前往該區之外人談、所有我國各不廠鋼版鐵版車床·機伴、以及住戶之細款物伴、書畫珍品、商店之商品貨物、均已被敵軍搬走一空、暴敵窮兇極惡、軍紀蕩然、於此可見一般按日方在我國內所有租界、此次日僑撤退時、所有日僑財產、均經我方妥為保護、絲毫無損、兩者相比、可見敵我兩國國格、逈然不同云、</p>
<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>德日訂立防共協定。對我亦迭作共同防共要求。據說此次對華用兵。一方欲遂行其大陸政策。一方亦是防止蘇聯南侵。是日本對於蘇聯。原是刻刻不忘念念不忘的仇敵。但是對華用兵正在難分難解之際。而日皇在宮中豐明殿。忽有歡宴蘇聯。大使斯拉夫某之盛舉。宴畢。復在牡丹問賜茶點。其賜宴一何突兀之甚。其態度一何親熱之甚。敵人藏匿着猙猛的面目。而諂笑脅肩。固屬長技。敵人之長於外交。見稱於世。亦於此可見。未知斯拉夫基對此威想若何。蘇聯朝野對此威想若何。若杯酒而果可以釋嫌。空天下昇平久矣。</p>

<p>日本陸軍於一九一四年勉强擴充到十九師團，一九一五年又增加了二師團，當時軍隊的內容組織，完全舊式，到了一九一八年，以俄為敵對國，並以侵華為目的，决計擴充師團，增厚實力，於是寺內內閣樹立了二十二軍團（四十四師）及要塞準備方案，一九一九年原敬內閣時代，因田中奏議的影響，又大量擴充軍費。迨大戰告終，俄國陸軍的裝備大大刷新，日本乃放棄“兵量擴張”的原則，模仿俄國的裝備改良方針，從“兵質充實”方面着手計劃，一九二○年成立了四億八千六百萬元的預算，翌年又增加至五億六千萬元，但因國內財源缺乏，大為議會所反對，將原案節减了四千萬元。一九二二年所謂“山梨整理軍備案”突然通過議會，整理的結果，减少人員總數，將士五萬四千，馬匹一萬三千，大約縮小了五個師團的實力，自是以後，又經過一九二四年的整理，編成步兵二百五十二連，騎兵二十九連，砲兵百○一連，工兵七連，輜重兵九連，可是一方雖經縮編，而他方仍謀改良，如步兵隊中，備有輕機關槍與步兵砲，與少數的重砲隊。這還只算得半新舊式的軍隊。其後發生了大地震，財政愈陷窮境，復興國內，尚目不及，那有餘力擴充？所以到了一九二五年再縮减為十七師團，新添戰車二連，飛行隊十連，高射砲六連，照察隊二連，氣球隊一連，其後經陸軍一再要求，增加預算，樹立了十年擴充計劃。從昭和一九二八年度起至一九三二年止，已將預定計劃，完成了三分之二，于是自以為實力充足，開始侵華，想實現田中奏摺大陸政策第一步而造成滿洲事變。一九三五年以降，又確定了新軍備充實案，力圖與俄國軍備相均衡。就是·一，增强在滿兵力，二，擴張航空，三，充實各項軍政的設施，四，整備作戰的資科，到了現在，表面上所稱的常備軍，全部仍為十七師團，人數為二十三萬，實際上已秘密擴充兵額至二十五師團了。至于兵的種類，計㊀野砲兵十五團（九十連）㊁山砲兵四團一營（九十連，）㊂步兵七十團六營（七百三十連，）㊃騎兵二十五團（七十連，）㊄騎砲兵一營（二十二連，）㊅野戰重砲兵八團（十一連）㊆重砲兵三團又獨立八連（三十四中隊）㊇工兵十七營（四十八連，）㊈鐵道兵集團（十六連）㊉電信兵團（十五連，）㊉㊀航空兵八團（二十六連，）㊉㊁氣球兵一營（二連）㊉㊂輜重兵十五營（三十連，）㊉㊃高射砲隊一團（四連，）㊉㊄戰車隊一團，以上為平時規定的陸軍人員與組織，到了戰時，他們自𧩘可召集在鄕二百萬人，可是自侵奪了東北四省以後，一為防範蘇俄，二為應付東北各地義勇軍已將國內陸軍調遣至東北者達十萬人。至蘆溝橋事變發生，又抽調勁旅至平津者六七萬人，其他分配于朝鮮台灣與南洋委任統治區域內，担任局部的防禦者，約四五萬人，這次上海戰事發生以後，所有留駐國內七八萬人，差不多悉數調至侵略前綫了。</p>

<h3>前綫去</h3>
<p>— 金堅</p>
<p>是一個深晚，大地披上了一件黑色的衣服，把月亮的光輝，也遮得暗淡了。氣候很冷，有風。</p>
<p>我們在這裏××醫院服務已一個多月了。今夜要到前方去担任警衛工作。</p>
<p>“到前方去？”這四個字，在我的腦海裏，已盤桓了一個多月的希望，今天得如願以償，我是怎樣的高興，怎樣的愉快！</p>
<p>滿腔熱血，像老火灶水鍋中的水一般沸騰，每一個血輪，鑽在心裏邊，擁擠着，擁擠着！</p>
<p>十多個同伴，大家圍集在門口，等待着卡車。掛錶像在和我們作對似的，今夜是走得特別的慢；五分鐘，十分鐘，很快的溜過，最後卡車是來了，我們把一件件行李搬上。當我們全被卡車吞進去時，牠是慢慢的蠕動了。</p>
<p>卡車開的眞快，像跑狗塲的電兎一般，轉了幾個彎，牠就直向××地駛去了。</p>
<p>突然卡車上的燈是熄了，那時，我們耳邊還收到“軋軋”的機槍聲：牠很勇敢的在黑暗中摸索前進，我們十多個人的心靈，也被帶得沉寂了。</p>
<p>夜光錶的長針，越過一刻鐘時，卡車跌入了一個深坑，要不是我摸一下自己的頭顱，那我相信自己一定是不在人間的了。</p>
<p>十幾個人，七手八脚的，把卡車從深坑中拖了出來，牠又繼續的前進了。</p>
<p>雜亂的槍聲砲聲，吿訴我們，已快到達目的地了，我們的心靈，在這時，不知蘊藏着怎樣的期望啊！</p>
<p>當卡車停下來時，我們卸下了行李，走進了一個森嚴的屋子。</p>
<p>我們走進去，休息了一會，後來我們被派到××地去担任警衛。日以六人，分三崗，每崗二人，晚上也是這樣。</p>
<p>在我的担任工作的，第三天，我們看見一個江北人帶進了，據一位巡護兵吿訴我，這江北人，受了敵人利用，來此察探軍情的，在他身邊，抄出了許多證件，手臂上還刺有太陽式的記號。</p>
<p>一星期後，我是被調了回來。</p>
<h3>遠東和平</h3>
<p>— 周義詳</p>
<p>誰都承認，遠東和平是世界和平的基石。</p>
<p>關於怎樣爭取遠東和平，這個問題，曾有許多人論及。這裏筆者以個人的觀察，貢獻幾點意見；</p>
<p>我們應以主動的地位，集中宏厚的力量，與侵略的野心國家反抗，趕出趁火打劫的日帝國主義，築起和平的大明燈，來領導一切需要和平的弱小國家，這是爭取遠東和平的第一個手段。</p>
<p>國際的糾紛，絕非單純體的東西，而是很複雜的事件，所以我們要保障世界和平，就不得不利用各種外交方式去與太平洋沿岸的和平國家携手，以鞏固遠東和平的基石，同時與他們聯成一條陣綫，使和平的力量更堅固更擴大，並組織和平的大本營，以消減侵略的野心國家，這是求取遠東和平的第二個手段。</p>
<p>歷史吿訴我們，中國愈是屈辱，帝國主義者却愈是猖獗，像東北四省的淪亡，就是－個很好的例子，所以，我們要達到和平的目的，那末唯有採取斷然的行動；與日帝國主義作殊死戰，這是求取遠東和平的第三個手段。</p>
<p>上述三個手段，我們如能切實的做到，那遠東和平的基石，就不難安定：卽世界之眞正和平也就易於達到了。</p>

        <h1>1937.10.05</h1>
<h3>Liu Hang's Enemy Plans Westward Advance, Intercepted by Us, Fierce Battles Day and Night in Zhabei and Jiangwan Unceasing</h3>
<p>Our Forces Hold Superior Positions on Baoxing Road and Shuidian Road. Our Troops Still Control Original Positions Southwest of Luodian. North of the Wenzaobang, Holding Tang Bridge Line, Enemy Finds it Difficult to Cross Secretly.</p>
<p>A reporter with the Central News Agency reported from the front lines at 5:00 PM on the 4th: For the past week between Luodian and Liu Hang, the enemy has been fiercely attacking. The artillery fire of both sides has been intense, shaking the earth, truly unprecedented in the history of the Far East. Our defense lines have suffered slight damage under the enemy's concentrated artillery fire. The enemy then devoted all its efforts to attacking Taiping Bridge and Doujia Lane near Liu Hang. Our troops, all determined to die with their positions, fought bravely to intercept and kill, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. However, due to the enemy's excessively dense artillery fire, it was difficult for our troops to receive reinforcements, causing the enemy, after paying a heavy price, to break through our positions at these two points. We had to move slightly west of the highway. Near Liu Hang, we set up a warning line at Wangjiazhai, only 800 meters from the highway. When the enemy's front line advanced to Taiping Bridge and Doujia Lane, they continued to advance westward, attempting to spy on Guangfu Town. However, upon advancing to the eastern edge of Dingjiazhai, they were blocked by our troops' strong positions. Currently, our troops are relying on solid positions to confront the enemy, vowing to fight another decisive battle with the enemy. The morale is unprecedentedly high. As for the Luodian area, in addition to firmly defending the Shi Xianggong Temple on the west side of the town, our troops are still holding the line of Yinjiazhai and Xiecun on the southwest side, only 400 meters from the highway. After the enemy's westward advance was blocked, they moved heavy troops to the north bank of the Wenzaobang, attempting to cross secretly and threaten our Dachang and Jiangwan positions. The two armies have clashed across the bank many times. Today, the enemy repeatedly attacked Tang Bridge, attempting to advance directly to the Hutai Highway and attack our rear. They were repelled by us after a day of fierce fighting. It is expected that a bloody battle will unfold in the coming days. Our troops are determined to defend the area to the death. It will be difficult for the enemy to succeed in crossing the bank and attacking south.</p>
<p>A reporter with the Central News Agency reported at 10:30 PM on the 4th: Fierce fighting in the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas continued today. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented since the start of the Shanghai battle. (1) Approximately 60 to 70 enemy aircraft dropped many bombs in the Jiangwan and Zhabei area, and the artillery also bombarded fiercely. Enemy infantry launched multiple attacks but all failed. (2) The enemy at the Patriotic Girls' School launched three attacks against our Chizhi University position before dawn and at 6:00 AM and 8:00 AM, but were all repelled. (3) There were also skirmishes in the Chen Lujiazhai area near Yejia Garden in Jiangwan. By 6:00 PM, each held their positions and exchanged fire with rifles, etc. The enemy also set fire to houses in the Sanmin Road north area. We used machine guns to sweep and kill many enemies. (4) On Baoshan Road, the enemy attacked again from Guangdong Street starting at 8:00 AM. They were once able to rush in, but after our counterattack at 3:00 PM, we drove the enemy away. By 7:00 PM, the gunfire subsided, but fires broke out in many places and were still burning at the time of reporting. (5) There was a small contact east of Fudan University at dawn, with mutual fire for half an hour before stopping. The Baziqiao area was quieter.</p>
<h3>Extremely Fierce Battles Unfold in Zhabei and Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Enemy Attacks Ceaselessly From Morning Till Night. We Fight Bravely and Inflict Repeated Heavy Damage.</p>
<p>A reporter with the Central News Agency reported at 12:00 PM on the 4th regarding the battle situation on the Zhabei and Jiangwan lines: After the enemy's repeated attacks yesterday failed, their ambition has not died, and they are increasingly plotting against us. Before dawn today (i.e., April 4th), they launched fierce attacks on us from several routes, resulting in fierce street fighting. By 9:00 AM, they had been repelled by us one after another. Then enemy aircraft and artillery combined to bombard us fiercely. The battle situation on each route this morning is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Baoxing Road and Guangdong Street</p>
<p>The enemy launched four attacks on Baoxing Road, Guangdong Street, and other places yesterday, but were repelled by us and suffered heavy damage. The enemy retreated in disarray towards North Sichuan Road, regrouping there and calling for reinforcements. We also rushed to repair fortifications and kept a close watch. At 4:30 AM, the enemy attacked Baoxing Road with one company and Guangdong Street with two companies. Multiple tanks were stationed in front of our positions, bombarding our defensive works with concentrated artillery fire. Their infantry was scattered behind the vehicles, frequently charging. Our army fought bravely to meet them, forming a dense network of fire with machine guns, preventing the enemy from gaining a foothold, and leaping out of the trenches, advancing through the rain of bullets, and throwing grenades fiercely, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. On Guangdong Street, the fierce battle lasted for three hours. The enemy's momentum was unsustainable. Around 9:00 AM, leaving behind more than a hundred corpses and more than forty guns, they retreated in defeat. On Baoxing Road, the enemy's forces were stronger. The battle lasted until 6:00 AM, when a section of our works was breached. We retreated about a few zhang (丈). The enemy advanced and built temporary works as they went. We selected strong soldiers and launched fierce attacks to destroy their works, resulting in bloody hand-to-hand combat. The enemy was extremely timid. Seeing us engage with bayonets, they fled backward in disorder. Our army charged left and right, killing more than seventy enemies, and pursued forward. At the time of reporting, they were still in a standoff in front of the Indian Church.</p>
<p>Jiangwan Road and Shuidian Road</p>
<p>Fierce battles also began on Jiangwan Road and Shuidian Road yesterday afternoon (the 3rd). The enemy attacked five times in one day but failed each time. At 3:00 AM on the 4th, they devoted all their efforts to attacking again. The military strength was very strong, with about one regiment or more of infantry, under the cover of seventeen tanks, attacking our Tangjiazhai and Chizhi University. The density of their artillery fire was unprecedented in the past twenty-odd days. However, our army was unusually calm. Waiting for the enemy to approach the entire line, they rose up to meet them, holding back and forth, attacking multiple times. The fierce battle lasted for five hours. By 9:00 AM, the enemy began to retreat slightly, leaving corpses all over the street, numbering over two hundred. The severity of their losses can be imagined. At the same time, small groups of troops attempted to attack our Baziqiao area. We skirmished slightly, and the enemy retreated immediately. However, enemy aircraft and artillery were still bombing continuously at noon.</p>
<p>Enemy Occupies Tianlu Temple and Does Not Retreat</p>
<p>In the Jiangwan area, our army has adopted an offensive posture. We have been attacking continuously for several days, and the enemy has suffered heavy damage. They have gathered near Tianlu Temple in the northeast of Jiangwan Town, occupying it and refusing to leave. According to reconnaissance reports, the enemy in the city center is sending reinforcements to that area, plotting to make further trouble. After the enemy troops withdrew from the city center area, our forward哨 soldiers searched and advanced, reaching the Songhu Road area in the afternoon of the 3rd, without encountering any obstacles. That night, our troops sneaked into the western part of the city center to reconnoiter and saw that the enemy had built important fortifications along Guhe Road, east of the city stadium. Therefore, when the enemy invited foreign reporters to visit, they only went as far west as the City Museum to the north and were not allowed to continue further.</p>
<p>Our Army Charges to East Baoxing Road</p>
<p>A reporter with the Central News Agency reported at 1:00 AM on the 5th that the enemy attacking East Baoxing Road at around 4:00 AM on the morning of the 4th numbered about two companies. After our army met them in battle and fought bloodily for five hours, the enemy retreated slightly. They came again in the afternoon, frequently charging fiercely with tanks, once breaking through and strongly occupying the Qixiu Girls' School. By 7:00 PM, our army counterattacked, using fire to attack. The enemy had no place to stand and retreated backward immediately. Our forward哨 had already charged to the eastern end of the road. At 11:00 PM, under the cover of smoke screens, the enemy mobilized tanks and came forward. At the time of reporting, fierce fighting had broken out at the forward哨. The enemy attacking Guangdong Street had retreated completely after our reinforcements attacked. Subsequently, a large team of tanks was very busy moving around the southern end of North Sichuan Road. Haskel Road had been quiet for two days. Just as our troops were guarding boringly, suddenly thirty or forty enemies staggered towards us at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. Our troops were extremely excited, leaping out to fight. They killed more than twenty enemies. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy abandoned corpses and weapons and left. On our side, only seven or eight people were injured.</p>
<p>We Defend Original Positions on Shuidian Road</p>
<p>A reporter with the Central News Agency reported at 1:00 AM on the 5th that the battle on Shuidian Road was the most intense. The enemy first attacked at 3:00 AM on the morning of the 4th but was repelled by us. They came again around 11:00 AM. Because enemy aircraft were active, we lay in ambush in the trenches to deal with them, sweeping with machine guns, preventing the enemy from approaching. After holding out until 5:00 PM, the enemy retreated slightly. They came again at 9:30 PM. A large team of enemy tanks stopped on Jiangwan Road, continuously sending reinforcements to Qujiaqiao and Jinjiazhai. Contact began half an hour before reporting, the sound of gunfire gradually became dense, and mortar fire rumbled continuously. We are still holding our original positions. The battle was relatively quiet on the Jiangwan Racecourse side.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Yesterday Between Liu Hang and Guangfu</h3>
<p>Desperate Grappling at Wenzaobang</p>
<p>A reporter with the Central News Agency reported at 11:50 AM on the 4th that after the center of gravity of the fighting in the Liu Hang area gradually shifted south, the fierce fighting tended towards the area east of the Hutai Highway on the north bank of the Wenzaobang. The enemy concentrated heavy troops and launched fierce attacks from several routes, attempting to cross the Wenzaobang in order to contain our Jiangwan and Zhabei lines. At dawn today, fierce battles occurred in the Tang Bridge and Yaojia Alley areas to the west. Both sides were grappling desperately, with our troops falling forward and following each other, firmly defending their original positions. At the time of reporting, the fighting was still ongoing. We also bombarded the enemy fiercely with heavy artillery. The enemy gradually appeared to be unable to withstand it. The bridgehead about half a kilometer east of Tang Bridge was bloodily fought over all night yesterday (the 3rd). Because the position there was too prominent, we crossed to the south bank in the morning (the 4th) to defend it. Currently, we are confronting each other across the bank. Also, before dawn, the enemy at Gujiazhai near Yanjiazhai, each carrying a life preserver, attempted to swim across. Our troops lay quietly on the shore. Waiting for them to cross halfway, they swept with machine guns. The enemy was in a dilemma, and many were shot and swept away by the current. As for the vicinity of Lao Yangzhai, near Wusong to the east, there were about a battalion of enemies who, since last night, have been shelling us from time to time and firing machine guns across the bank, seemingly also intending to cross the bank. We have been keeping a close watch.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops Repelled at North Meizhai</p>
<p>From the Luodian to Liu Hang line to the Wenzaobang, the enemy has been attacking fiercely for nearly a week. The intensity of their artillery fire is unprecedented. It is conceivable that the enemy is eager to advance. There is no doubt that our works in the Liu Hang area have been damaged. Therefore, we deployed new defensive lines along the line about one or two kilometers west of the Hutai Highway, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy and then moving rapidly. Within a few hours, the entire line had established close contact. The enemy still suspected it was a trick, first using aircraft to scout, then bombarding fiercely with artillery, firing constantly over a thousand rounds in one day. Then their troops began to advance slowly. On the evening of the 3rd, the enemy attacking from Liu Hang approached our positions and fierce fighting broke out in front of Guangfu Town. The enemy advancing from Taiping Bridge engaged our troops in fierce fighting in the Baiyan Liangtang North Luzhai area. We attacked multiple times, holding out until 4:00 PM, when the enemy, suffering heavy casualties, retreated immediately. This morning (the 4th), a battalion of enemy troops, under the cover of five or six tanks, attacked our positions near North Meizhai and were also repelled by us. At this moment, the enemy is using aircraft and artillery combined fire to bombard our entire line fiercely.</p>
<p>Strictly Guarding West of the Highway</p>
<p>A reporter with the Central News Agency reported at 9:30 PM on the 4th that our troops have moved west from Liu Hang and are now firmly defending the Wangjiazhai, Zhangzhai, Yangjiaxiang, Zhu Sanfang, and other places about 800 meters to 1,000 meters from the highway, strictly on guard. From early this morning (i.e., the 4th), the enemy bombarded fiercely with aircraft and artillery until the evening without stopping, firing over a thousand rounds. However, no enemy soldiers were seen charging. Fierce fighting is expected in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Enemy Artillery on North Bank of Wenzaobang Moving West</h3>
<p>Our Artillery Shells Fiercely for One Hour, Inflicting Heavy Losses on the Enemy. Repeated Attacks on Our Tang Bridge Positions Result in Defeat.</p>
<p>A reporter with the Central News Agency reported at 10:00 PM on the 4th that the enemy army on the north bank of the Wenzaobang seemed very active. (1) About two regiments have gathered at Dongyangzhai and Zhouzhai, busy constructing fortifications and stockpiling bridge-building materials, preparing to cross the bank. These two places are about 3.5 kilometers east of the Hutai Highway and about 2 kilometers south of Miaohang across the Wenzaobang. (2) The enemy artillery position there is at Miaoji, about 2 kilometers east of Dongyangzhai. At 4:00 PM today (i.e., the 4th), it suddenly moved westward, very busy with transportation. We immediately shelled fiercely with mortars for one hour, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. (3) In the afternoon, a balloon was released above the enemy's position, staying in the air for about two hours, spying on our army's positions. (4) Our Tang Bridge position, guarding the mouth of the Hutai Highway on the north bank of the bank, has not moved until the evening. The enemy has been attacking fiercely multiple times since dawn, but retreated without success until 6:00 PM. (5) The sound of gunfire on the Wenzaobang has not stopped all day. Our heavy artillery inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. The enemy has been constantly firing machine guns from afar, but their attempt to cross secretly has not succeeded.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Luodian Area</h3>
<p>We Firmly Defend Shi Xianggong Temple and Deploy Warning Lines</p>
<p>In the Luodian area, we are still relying on Shi Xianggong Temple for defense, and warning lines are deployed in front of it. The enemy first used aircraft to scout and shelled our [unclear][unclear][unclear][unclear] and [unclear][unclear][unclear][unclear] positions all day. Then their 42nd Infantry Regiment, about a thousand strong, charged fiercely at our [unclear][unclear][unclear][unclear] positions several times, but all failed. Near the evening, they released smoke bombs to cover their infantry reinforcements, but were eventually repelled by us. Yesterday morning, the enemy attacked our [unclear][unclear][unclear][unclear] positions again, and the fighting was extremely fierce.</p>
<h3>Skirmish Occurs East of Miaohang</h3>
<p>A reporter with the Central News Agency reported at 9:30 PM on the 4th that the enemy appeared to be probing the 300-meter line in front of the Tomb of Unknown Heroes east of Miaohang, and a skirmish has occurred.</p>
<h3>Our Artillery Displays Great Power Yesterday</h3>
<p>A reporter with the Central News Agency reported at 9:30 PM on the 4th that our army's artillery, which usually operates at night, suddenly displayed great power in the daytime, fiercely shelling the enemy's positions north of the Wenzaobang and in the Hongkou area. The enemy was panicked and suffered heavy damage.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Rampage Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Over twenty enemy aircraft continued to rampage yesterday, circling constantly over Jiangwan, Dachang, Zhabei, Mackinnon Road Station, Beixinjing, Zhenru, and Nanxiang, dropping many bombs. Many of our civilians were killed, especially the villagers working in the fields and carrying loads into the city in Beixinjing and Zhenru, who were disturbed by the rumbling sound of enemy aircraft.</p>
<h3>Enemy Continues to Transport Large Quantities of Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, six converted enemy merchant ships, the Meigen Maru, Xing'an Maru, Chunharu Maru, Fengkawa Maru, (No. 224), Ikuta Maru, and another unnamed transport ship, successively sailed into Shanghai, docking in turn at Huangpu, Osaka, Huishan, North Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, Central Wharf, and Pier 5. At the same time, large quantities of enemy air force bombs, unmounted aircraft parts in many boxes, heavy artillery, bamboo poles, wooden planks, and other military supplies were unloaded ashore and transported to the enemy's front lines by more than thirty trucks. As for the Beiguang Maru, Daan Maru, Singapore Maru, and other four ships, which transported about 500 enemy artillerymen and military supplies to Shanghai yesterday morning, they had finished unloading and sailed out of the Songkou before 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, returning to Japan. Of the enemy transport ships that had arrived in Shanghai successively in the past few days, only the Haguro Maru and Shinyo Maru remained, berthed separately at the Huangpu Wharf and No. 16 Buoy, and had not yet sailed out.</p>
<h3>Copper and Iron Stolen From War Zone</h3>
<p>Since the enemy army occupied the Yangshupu area as its positions, the newly stored copper and iron pieces in the steel shops and warehouses in the area have been stolen by the enemy army. On the previous and yesterday days, four or five boatloads were transported to Japan for the production of military supplies. Even the metal parts on the doors and windows of residents were removed, indicating that the enemy army is severely lacking in both copper and iron.</p>
<h3>American Missionary Earnestly Admonishes Japanese Citizens</h3>
<p>Many Admonitions Regarding Japan's Aggressive Actions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, an English newspaper in this city, published a public letter from Dr. Jones, an American missionary, to the Japanese people on the 4th. In the letter, he earnestly admonished the violent Japanese regarding their aggressive behavior. Dr. Jones has been preaching in China for many years and is highly respected, revered by people of all countries. This time, driven by righteous indignation, he spoke out justly. However, the violent Japanese are stubbornly incorrigible and resent criticism, so it is feared that it will be difficult to make them pull back from the brink and that Dr. Jones's good intentions will be in vain. The original text is very long, and the following is an abridged translation: I apologize for abruptly writing this public letter, and I am writing to you, the people, at the risk of causing misunderstanding, because I have my reasons. First, I am a friend of your country and have always expressed admiration for all of you, the people. Second, I deeply feel that all of you, the people, have been led astray by your leaders, especially the military leaders. Third, I believe that there are countless people in the world who share my views, so it is necessary to express my opinions to you. There are three attitudes that you, the people of your country, can choose to adopt: (1) maintain isolation; (2) cooperate with China on the basis of friendship; (3) maintain hostile relations with China, and thereby be at odds with the countries of East Asia or even the world. The first attitude is obviously impossible, and the second has been rejected by your country, so your country has adopted the third attitude. This is truly a great mistake for your country. Knowledgeable politicians in your country strongly advocate adopting the second attitude. If your country adopts this good idea, then all the countries of East Asia will surely benefit. Your country has gifts that all countries in the world need, but because of the high military barriers, all countries are suffering from not being able to receive them. If you say that the reason why China and Japan cannot cooperate is because of China's resistance, it is true that your country has seized Chinese land and violated Chinese sovereignty. China has refused. China has refused this form of cooperation, and all countries that have expressed their refusal deeply agree. Because all countries know that this is not cooperation, this is "control," this is the relationship between master and servant. If this kind of cooperation is accepted, China will lose its soul and its land. Think about it carefully. If China accepts this cooperation, can you respect China? I am sure your answer is "no." Or it may be said that your country's aggression is due to overpopulation. I also strongly advocate that all countries in the world should pay serious attention to this and try to solve it. But can you use this as an excuse to invade China? This kind of sophistry cannot even be established for Manchuria. Thirty years ago, because of overpopulation, 30 million Chinese people moved into Manchuria. Can your country's farmers compete with Chinese farmers in Chinese land? I am afraid your country can never use overpopulation as an excuse for aggression. So where does the reason for aggression lie? Or it may be said that China's politics are chaotic, and your country's mission is to clarify Chinese politics. But in fact, after years of effort, China's politics have greatly improved. China has seen internal unity. Your country's mission is not the time. Your country's unwarranted interference will only make China's politics even more chaotic. If you really want China to prosper, why not let China develop on its own? The world situation is unpredictable. If your country has a war with the Soviet Union, then you will have a country with hundreds of millions of people as your enemy. Even if your country wins this war, the problem will still not be solved. You will encounter the anger of a volcanic eruption and suffer greatly. Moreover, the war will be prolonged, so how can your country be sure of victory? Your country's economic structure is extremely precarious and difficult to support. In addition, countries express sympathy for China and will implement economic sanctions against your country. I am afraid that your country's leaders have led you astray and put your national strength at stake. Your future is extremely dangerous. In fact, you should cooperate with China along the path of friendship, and both sides will benefit. (The rest omitted)</p>
<h3>War Diary (1)</h3>
<p>— Special War Correspondent Chen Wanli, Central News Agency</p>
<p>September 28th</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock in the morning, I departed from Shanghai, bidding farewell to the city's towering buildings, and entered a vast green expanse. My mind was filled with excitement and joy.</p>
<p>On both sides of the road were fields planted with cotton. The withered yellow leaves, lush green branches, and snow-white blossoms adorned this boundless field. Farm women and children bent over, picking cotton. Their husbands and fathers were all serving in the stationed army. In today's national mobilization, the vast peasantry is by no means an exception.</p>
<p>On the way, we encountered enemy planes twice, bombing not far away. The farm women and children picking cotton stopped their work and lay on the ground. I also got out of the car and went to the fields to hide. After running back and forth for half the day, I finally reached my destination in the evening. From tonight on, I will be living the life of a soldier.</p>
<p>September 29th</p>
<p>Last night, amidst the booming of cannons, the chirping of insects from outside the walls evoked memories of my childhood. Seventeen years ago, I could distinguish these various insect sounds, knowing what each one was. Yes, I have been away from my hometown for seventeen years. These seventeen years have passed quickly like smoke. However, in these seemingly short seventeen years, we have suffered the enemy's humiliation to the fullest extent. But now, we have stood up. Total resistance has begun. We are determined to drive the enemy out of our country.</p>
<p>From six o'clock to eleven o'clock in the morning, enemy planes continuously bombed Jiangwan, Miaohang, and Zhabei areas. Amidst the heavy explosions of bombs, sporadic bursts of rapid machine-gun fire constantly pounded our eardrums. There was scarcely ten minutes of peace.</p>
<p>From the military officers, I learned that the enemy's bombing, besides causing considerable losses to the people, had not inflicted any military damage on us. In this scorched-earth resistance, we all do not hope to escape unscathed. The enemy's bombs only planted deep hatred in our hearts. The power of this hatred, perhaps, will be the power of our final victory in the war.</p>
<p>Today, I met several high-ranking military officers. They are all optimistic about the war and have twelve points of confidence and certainty. Because the enemy's only advantage lies in cannons and planes. When the enemy shells or bombs, our troops can safely hide, so the enemy's cannons and planes have lost their effectiveness. As for the enemy's infantry, they are simply losing generals who always lose in every battle. As long as we can meet the enemy face to face, we will surely defeat them utterly. The so-called "Imperial Army" of Bushido and Yamato spirit simply dare not easily show their faces in front of our positions. Under these circumstances, it is by no means easy for the enemy to seek even an inch of progress.</p>
<p>Shelling has begun again in the dark space, but not as densely as last night. Perhaps the sound of cannons will become our lullaby every night.</p>
<p>September 30th</p>
<p>I woke up at half-past five this morning and heard the air raid alarm. Although enemy planes appeared over our positions several times today, they soon flew away. All in all, it was a very peaceful day.</p>
<p>The weather was very good in the morning. I sent a batch of war reports back to Shanghai. But only fifteen minutes later, it started to rain. I was always worried about whether the war reports could reach Shanghai safely. It was not until I learned from the phone in the evening that they had arrived safely that I felt relieved.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the sound of cannons rang intermittently and did not stop until the evening. According to high-ranking military officers, the enemy's only purpose in shelling is to disrupt the rear of our position. Last night, when the enemy fired very densely, our artillery also concentrated its fire and bombarded the enemy's artillery positions, firing nearly a hundred shells in succession. The enemy's cannon fire stopped immediately. It is expected that the enemy must have suffered considerable damage.</p>
<p>In the army, there are so many small flying insects (flies and mosquitoes) that people living in the concessions would not even imagine it. During the day, flies harass in groups, daring to stay on people's faces all the time. When you wave them away, they leave and come back again. At night, it is the time for mosquitoes to run rampant, attacking people everywhere, making it impossible to write a word quietly. These small flying insects are just as annoying as enemy planes. Let's hide in the quilt to avoid the attack of small flying insects, even though it's only half-past eight now.</p>
<p>October 1st</p>
<p>Yesterday's shelling all night, today is bombing all day long. This seems to be the enemy's only power. But what effect does it have? According to reports from various lines, although the enemy has been shelling and bombing fiercely for days, no large enemy troops have come to attack. To make progress on the battlefield, infantry charges are always needed. Since the enemy's infantry is so timid and useless, then all-day bombing and all-night shelling are just a waste of ammunition. What's the use? The soldiers on our front line have been waiting for several days, waiting for a hearty fight.</p>
<p>From dawn this morning until dusk, the rumbling of engines, interspersed with the heavy sound of explosions and the rapid sound of machine guns, disturbed the peace all day long. Although the air raid alarms rang busily and the houses shook violently, everyone quietly continued to work as usual. The basement was deserted, with not a single person to be found.</p>
<p>At noon, we received a report that the enemy's position on the Jiangwan front had retreated about a thousand meters, and at the same time, a large force of the enemy retreated in the direction of Yangshupu and Wusong. Everyone was very happy to hear this news, because in the past few days, the enemy concentrated its forces in the downtown area, trying to break through our Jiangwan line. Since our army met them head-on with a heavy blow, the enemy's dream has been shattered, and now they have to retreat to plan other advances. According to a senior officer, the battle in Shanghai is now entirely a positional warfare. Our army is fighting steadily, step by step. It is a dream for the enemy to try to break through any point of our line.</p>
<p>The sound of cannons is ringing again. I really feel sorry for the blood and sweat of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>October 2nd</p>
<p>Although enemy planes were active as usual today, they were not as busy as yesterday. The front lines of Zhabei and Jiangwan were also quite quiet.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I saw many spoils of war. At half-past eight on the evening of the 27th of last month, the enemy attacked our Jiiawan position south of Sanmin Road. Our army gave them a head-on blow, and the enemy was defeated and retreated to the Li's house area in a disarray, leaving many corpses behind. One of them was Sergeant Kawamatsu and Tsutsuki of the 1st Company of the 6th Regiment of the enemy's 3rd Division. Many spoils of war were captured, including one name badge of Company Commander Kawakami, one name badge of Squad Leader Yamashita, one shoulder epaulet each, one mimeographed stencil of the 11th Division, one list of items and quantities, one notice, one bronze plate, one receipt and one mailing certificate each, three propaganda materials, one notebook of correspondence paper, one black notebook, two detachment meeting records, one organization chart of the First Company, 228 Japanese yen, one package of bird feathers, and one family letter.</p>
<p>Among the above-mentioned many spoils of war, the three propaganda materials were all printed with something like "Poems Praising the Japanese Spirit." The notebook of correspondence paper recorded orders and detailed reports. The black notebook was the diary of the enemy sergeant Kawamatsu and Tsutsuki. It recorded that he boarded a ship on September 16, landed at Wusong on the 17th, and was later stationed successively at the Conservatory of Music, the Shanghai Cemetery, Youjia Lane, and Li's House. The two detachment meeting records stated that infectious diseases had occurred in the army and instructed the soldiers on how to prevent epidemics and how to clean the positions, etc. The First Company's organization chart stated that each company was divided into three squads, each squad was divided into six classes, each class had 13 to 14 people, and the entire company had about 250 people. 228 Japanese yen have been issued to the first meritorious unit as a bonus. As for the package of bird feathers, it is not known what it is used for. In addition, a family letter found on Kawamatsu and Tsutsuki was written on September 16 and sent to the "Silver Refinery in Chokyo (?) Village, Kagawa (?) County, Kagawa (?) Prefecture, Japan" to be given to his family. But he should not have written it and sent it out immediately, so that it could never be delivered. The letter was written on paper for wrapping peaches from "Jiangwan Peach Orchard." On the two thin sheets of paper, there were four red peaches and the words "Jiangwan Peach Orchard" printed in the middle. The blank spaces were densely filled with words. Now, the content of the letter is translated as follows: "Since boarding the ship on the 16th, it has been like a cow entering a pen, without any freedom. After landing, I only hear the sound of guns and cannons, day and night. From time to time, bombs fly over. The atmosphere in Shanghai is getting colder, but there are still many mosquitoes and flies. There are no mosquito nets here, and there is no way to take a bath, which is very painful. It has been raining these days, and the accumulated water has submerged our feet. We have to prepare for battle at all times, and our boots never leave our feet. We cannot sleep at night, and we are extremely tired. There is not a single person in the houses of the people here. Six or seven out of ten houses have been burned down. It is difficult for the army to get food, and there is a shortage of drinking water. We are now about 700 meters away from the Chinese army. We can see the enemy's movements vaguely in the villages where the trenches meander. Yanagi and other friends have not met since they landed. Many of those who fought together have died in battle, and even more have been injured. As for what will happen to my life, only the gods know. Farewell, take care, and I hope you will take good care of yourself. The education of our children must not be neglected!" (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Hoping the Whole World Will Economically Boycott Japan</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhonghua</p>
<p>When Japanese imperialism used all its force to invade our land, massacre our civilians, and destroy all our cultural buildings, it has aroused a wave of anger and protest in countries around the world. Many newspapers and publications have unanimously condemned the Japanese imperialists’ aggressive atrocities; countless righteous people have risen up to oppose the Japanese imperialists’ brutal massacres. Now, this opposition and protest has rapidly manifested itself in concrete actions. Everyone is not buying Japanese goods, and everyone is not selling goods to Japan. Many workers have spontaneously refused to load munitions and raw materials for Japan. This movement to economically boycott Japanese aggressors is currently developing vigorously and becoming a huge torrent of the world's opposition to Japanese imperialism. After all, the power of human sympathy is great. The outbreak of international righteousness can ultimately break through all boundaries. In addition to being inspired, we would like to say a few more words to the people around the world who are enthusiastically helping our country.</p>
<p>We want to tell righteous people all over the world that the economic boycott movement currently being launched and unfolded can stop the aggressive ambitions of Japanese imperialism. But this boycott movement should be further expanded and deepened. It would be best if governments of various countries could also make a firm decision to unanimously refuse to provide the Japanese warlords with economic assistance until their acts of aggression cease. In the economic boycott movement currently underway, it seems that some people say that the League of Nations' economic sanctions against Italy ended in failure. But we want to point out that the failure of the sanctions against Italy was precisely because this economic sanctions plan was not thoroughly implemented. Now, as long as Japan can be thoroughly boycotted, and steel and oil are refused to be given to Japan, its aggressive power will be greatly hit. It also seems that some people say that to thoroughly boycott Japan, armed conflict with it may be unavoidable, but this is obviously an overconcern. Only if countries continue to economically help Japan will its aggressive ambitions be infinitely expanded. And the worldwide implementation of economic boycotts is the best way to quickly reduce Japan's aggressive ambitions and prevent it from extending its military force to other countries.</p>
<p>The following statistical materials can help everyone understand the seriousness of the economic boycott's strike against the Japanese warlords. In recent years, in order to prepare for a large-scale invasion of China and to prepare to challenge the world, the Japanese military cabinet has put forward the so-called "wartime system" plan, desperately buying war materials from abroad, and large quantities of scrap steel and scrap iron have been bought from Hong Kong, Malaya, the Americas and other places. British and American oil merchants operating in Japan have been forced to store six months of oil. In the past three years, from January to October 1934, the value of munitions raw materials and semi-finished products imported by Japan was 14,780,000 yen. In the same period in 1935, it increased to 16,050,000 yen. In the same period in 1936, it increased to 18,070,000 yen. In order to continuously increase the import of munitions raw materials, Japan has desperately dumped its cotton textiles at low prices, disrupting the world market. But due to such an expansion of armaments, the treasury of Japanese aggressors has become very empty. Currently, its cash reserves are two times lower than in 1927. Its budget deficit reaches 800 million yen per year. Its public debt has also reached 12 billion yen. Now Japanese imperialism has accelerated the wheels of its war. Its economic crisis will naturally become more serious. At this time, only international economic blockade can eliminate its aggressive ambitions. If it is indulged now, its steps of mad aggression will surely run rampant on all sides.</p>
<p>A Japanese writer, Arisawa Hiromi, once said that Japan fears wartime raw material blockade the most. Because out of the 22 main war materials, Japan can only guarantee 5% of nine of them, namely lead, cotton, zinc, rubber, nickel, wool, potassium and mercury. It can only guarantee 10% to 25% of four of them, namely oil, aluminum, phosphorus and tin. It can guarantee 40% to 70% of three of them, namely iron, manganese and nitrogen. It can guarantee 90% to 100% of six others, namely coal, sulfur, steel, heavy stone and mica. From this statistic, it can be seen that Japan is very short of iron ore and oil, the two most basic wartime materials. Although it can now use the munitions and raw materials accumulated in recent years to carry out large-scale massacres in China, as long as the world can economically blockade Japan, its policy of mad massacres will not last long.</p>
<p>Last month, when a Japanese ship was loading scrap iron in the United States, someone gave a speech to the dockworkers, saying: "This scrap iron is being loaded onto Japan today, made into bullets, and used to shoot Chinese civilians. But tomorrow, these bullets will be used to shoot American civilians." This meaningful remark is worth everyone's attention. Today, we are resisting the Japanese aggression. Helping us today is also preventing Japan's challenge to the world tomorrow.</p>
<h3>After the Eighth Route Army Captured Shuoxian, Jingping Town Was Also Recovered</h3>
<p>More than a thousand enemies were completely defeated, and a large number of enemy military supplies were seized. Yuxian was also captured by our army.</p>
<p>[Xi'an] The Eighth Route Army reported to the provincial government by telegram: "Good news! Our army detachment attacked Jingping Town at 3:00 PM on the 2nd and completely defeated the enemy forces of more than 1,000 people. The enemy fled in a southeasterly direction. Our army recovered Jingping and seized eight tanks, fifteen armored vehicles, five cars, thirty-six rifles, two machine guns, eight boxes of machine gun bullets, killed more than 200 enemies, captured 50, and seized a large number of other military supplies. (Central News Agency, 4th)"</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Eighth Route Army Office in Nanjing reported that a unit of the army had recovered Shuoxian on the morning of the 1st of this month and is now advancing to the northwest of Shuoxian. Another unit of the army is still conducting guerrilla warfare against the enemy in the Pingxingguan Wutai Mountain area, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. (Central News Agency, 4th)"</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] On the 30th, a unit of our Eighth Route Army completely recovered Shuoxian, capturing more than 200 Japanese, puppet, and Mongolian troops. The remaining enemies were defeated in a panic, and we are still pursuing them. (Central News Agency, 1st) (Late Arrival) (Local News) Mr. Pan Hannian, the representative of a certain army stationed in Shanghai, talked about the victory of our army in Pingxingguan. Due to the distance, the reports in Shanghai were inconsistent. I received a telegram from the two commanders of the front yesterday, and the content was more detailed. I will report the details that were not published in the newspapers as follows:</p>
<p>Our army seized more than 80 enemy military vehicles, one artillery piece, more than 2,000 artillery shells, and more than 1,000 rifles, and killed more than 1,000 enemies. The enemy's high command was once surrounded by our army, and a large number of enemy secret documents were seized, including a Japanese map of the enemy's entire North China operation plan and offensive direction. The enemy broke through and escaped at dusk and could not be completely eliminated, which is a real regret. But the victory of this battle has shattered the Japanese invaders' plan to attack Pingxingguan, so the enemy can only attack from the Yanmenguan area. Currently, a unit of our army is active between Lingqiu, Hunyuan, and Yuxian. Yuxian has been captured by our army, and a large number of supplies have been seized. Currently, the activities of this unit are forcing the enemy to mobilize large groups of troops to fight our army, making it quite difficult for the Japanese invaders to cope.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Attack on Dezhou Failed</h3>
<p>The enemy's infantry and artillery jointly launched a fierce attack. Our reinforcements joined the battle, repelling the stubborn enemy, and the situation improved.</p>
<p>[Jinan] This morning, an enemy armored train attacked Dezhou and was repelled by us. Our reinforcements joined the front, and the situation improved. The enemy did not dare to send out sentries at night, and relied on its superior artillery fire to attack during the day. (Special Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] On the 3rd, the enemy used infantry and artillery to jointly launch a fierce attack on our Dezhou position from morning to night, and we killed four or five hundred people. We also suffered forty or fifty casualties. At 3:00 PM, the enemy again used planes and artillery to destroy the northwest corner of the city. Our army braved the artillery fire and used sacks to build blockades. The fierce battle continued. Ten enemy planes bombed our position many times. Today, enemy planes dropped eighteen bombs near a train in Hanzhuang, destroying fourteen sections of the track. (Special Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Military Information: The enemy on the Jinpu Line launched a fierce attack on us from morning to evening on the 3rd, using infantry and artillery. We calmly responded and destroyed one enemy tank and killed more than 500 enemy soldiers. We also suffered dozens of casualties.

<h3>Zhongshan University Bombed, Zou Lu Issues Written Statement</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Guangdong’s Zhongshan University was wantonly bombed by enemy aircraft. The university’s president, Zou Hairbin, issued the following written statement: The Japanese invaders not only seek to swallow the entirety of China, but also to encroach upon the world and destroy world civilization. Therefore, since the beginning of their aggression, they have made a special effort to destroy our nation's cultural institutions, wantonly bombing Tianjin’s Nankai University, Hebei Women’s Normal College, Hebei Institute of Technology, Shanghai’s Hujiang University, Wusong’s Tongji University, Nanchang’s Baoling Women’s School, Wuhan’s Literary Middle School, and National Central University. This is known to all. Zhongshan University was founded by the Premier Sun Yat-sen himself, and the new campus in Shipai was also planned by the Premier. Therefore, it is the largest in scale, and its students are particularly imbued with the Premier’s principles. Their spirit of resistance is also the most pronounced. The enemy has long referred to “Zhongshan University as a major base for resisting Japan.” Therefore, since the start of the war of resistance, Zhongshan University has been bombed several times. Yesterday, our Law School was completely destroyed. Zhongshan University is surrounded by over 30,000 mu of land, with no other buildings nearby. Enemy newspapers have referred to it as a cultural zone. If the enemy did not deliberately seek to eliminate cultural institutions, there would be no reason for repeated bombings. Some say that the Premier's planning of the university on such a large scale invited the enemy's bombing. However, other institutions of smaller scale than Zhongshan University have also been bombed, showing that the enemy is solely intent on eliminating our cultural institutions, regardless of size. Some say that Zhongshan University’s most fervent spirit of resistance invited the bombing. However, this is not unique to Zhongshan University. Which school or citizen in the entire country does not harbor the determination to perish with the Japanese? The more violent the enemy's bombs, the more intense our spirit of resistance. Therefore, the enemy's bombing only serves as a warning bell for our nation. It must be known that the Premier’s spirit endures. Not only can the schools personally founded by the Premier not be destroyed, but also, based on the Premier’s spirit, we will ultimately defeat the enemy, recover our lost territories, complete our sovereignty, and place China in a position of independence and freedom. This is what we can be confident in, and it is what the enemy should realize. (4th, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Red Cross Society Establishes Wounded Soldier Hospital in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Smooth Progress in Negotiations by Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Pang Jingzhou, Secretary-General of the China Red Cross Society, recently came to Nanjing from Shanghai to negotiate the care of wounded soldiers, which has progressed very smoothly. It is reported that the Society has established a large-scale wounded soldier hospital in Nanjing with a capacity of 5,000 beds. Once preparations are complete, it will begin admitting patients. According to Pang Jingzhou, since the outbreak of the full-scale war, the Society has mobilized branches throughout the country to assist the government in handling relief efforts from a charitable standpoint. Three surgical teams have been dispatched to the Wan-Jin (Shanxi) area to provide services. In the Shanghai area, hospitals are being established along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Nanjing-Hangzhou railways to treat wounded soldiers, with significant results. It is planned to gradually expand these efforts to meet the needs. The Society has concrete plans for procuring medical supplies and adjusting police personnel. However, with the war zone so extensive, the Society bears a heavy responsibility and deeply hopes for the support of people at home and abroad to maximize relief efforts.

<h3>Fishermen Detail the Bombardment by Japanese Warships</h3>
<p>Three Shots Fired Without Warning; Wives and Children Perish, Boat Sinks</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] The fishermen who escaped after their boats were sunk by enemy warships off Qilin Point on the 22nd of last month, having detoured back to port, can all provide detailed accounts of the incident. According to Li Wen, the owner of fishing boat No. 3407, at 8:30 AM on the 22nd, he, his family, and his partners were fishing off Qilin Point when they suddenly saw a Japanese submarine approaching from a distance. The vessel was half-submerged, with only the conning tower and cannons visible. Without any warning, the ship fired three shots at their boat. The first shot killed his wife and three daughters. The second shot sank their boat. Of the 15 survivors, two women clung to broken planks from the wrecked sailboat in the water, drifting towards Qilin Point. They were later rescued by passing boats and managed to survive. At that time, he witnessed more than ten fishing boats being sunk by the shelling, with no warning given by the ship beforehand. He could not help but feel deeply saddened as he spoke. Chen Lian, a boat owner from Macau, said that his fishing boat was No. 1753. On that day, they were fishing near the lighthouse when a Japanese destroyer with two smokestacks approached. More than 30 Japanese soldiers jumped onto their boat, ordered him and all his partners to jump down into his small sampan alongside the boat, and ordered them to leave. They then moved all the baskets of fresh fish on the boat back onto their ship and set the boat on fire with kerosene. They rowed for more than a day before reaching Macau.

<p>[Hong Kong] According to Hong Kong government officials, since the Japanese Navy occupied the famous South China weather station on Pratas Reef, weather reports have stopped, putting ships traveling in the South China Sea in great danger. Over the past few days, the Hong Kong government has discussed ways to continue providing reports with the Japanese authorities, but the Japanese Navy there has not taken it seriously. For example, the gust of wind that passed over the reef at 6:00 AM this morning was not announced. The American mail ship Wilson, en route to San Francisco, and the Jefferson, about to arrive in Hong Kong, both telegraphed Hong Kong to report encountering a very strong hurricane en route, but the station had not issued any report. Therefore, it is believed here that this action by the Japanese greatly endangers the safety of ships. (4th, National Telegraph)</p>

<h3>International Problems Association Cables Gratitude to British and American Boycott Japanese Goods Movement</h3>
<p>Halting Aggression and Re-establishing Peace</p>
<p>Honorary President of the International Problems Research Association Yan Huiqing, President Li Zhaoshi, and all directors yesterday cabled the British Labour Movement National Executive Committee, the Peacebuilding Association, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Viscount Cecil, the economist Keynes, the British Non-War Association, the China-America Friendship Society, Indian National Congress leader Nehru, and various labor groups in Australia and New Zealand, commending the boycott of Japanese goods movement. The original text of the cable said: "We are pleased to hear of the promotion of the boycott of Japanese goods movement. We deeply admire it. We hope to work hard to promote economic sanctions to stop aggression and re-establish peace."</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Forcibly Collect Passport Fees</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly Large Sums; Intention to Defraud Resembles Robbery</p>
<p>Authentic information states that since the enemy troops set up tax collection agencies in the eastern district of Shanghai, all the large quantities of goods left by foreign merchants at various docks have now been detained by the enemy troops. These goods will not be released until customs duties are paid. Therefore, most of the foreign merchants' goods cannot be transported out. It is said that recently, the enemy troops have intensified their efforts. All goods, in addition to paying customs duties, must also pay a freight passport fee. The amount stipulated is surprisingly large. Yesterday, a certain foreign merchant went to the Jardine Matheson Wharf to transport loans and was forced by the Japanese visitors to obtain a passport. It stated that the valid period was ten days, and the fee paid reached 900 taels. If it is overdue by one day and is not renewed, it will be collected again. It is already obvious that they intend to extort money and deliberately make things difficult. As a result, foreign merchants have engaged in collective discussions and will adopt effective measures to deal with it. The enemy’s actions are tantamount to robbers, which are difficult for all parties to tolerate.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Report Food Panic in Japan</h3>
<p>Production Reduced Due to Natural Disasters; Consumption Increased Due to War</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun of September 28, the national rice harvest in Japan this year, according to a survey by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, is one-third less than last year. This year, it is only 60 million koku. The reasons for the reduction this year are that the Shikoku area and other places were severely damaged by typhoons, and the Kanto and Kansai areas also suffered poor harvests due to early droughts. Therefore, the people's food has been greatly affected. In the past, Japan has always felt a lack of food. In recent years, agricultural experts have conducted extensive research and applied heavy fertilizers, and production only began to increase last year. However, this year, due to severe natural disasters, production has been greatly reduced. Moreover, with the outbreak of internal warfare, food requisitions have been frequent, and society is quite panicked.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Plunder and Seize Quarantine Vessels</h3>
<p>Destroying Quarantine Work; Violating International Law</p>
<p>Our Ministry of the Interior’s Seaport Quarantine Office’s three quarantine ships, "Mulan" and "Zhongjing", have recently been illegally seized by enemy warships and re-docked at the Dong Huangpu Wharf for use. In the case of an undeclared war, the enemy dares to destroy the seaport quarantine work of the opposing warring country, which is another violation of international law.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Wounded Soldier Hospital</h3>
<p>Red Cross Society Established in the Interior; Lack of Talent and Materials</p>
<p>In order to popularize relief efforts throughout the country, the China Red Cross Society Headquarters has established a capital office in Nanjing. The Secretary-General, Pang Jingzhou, led staff members with mechanical equipment and applicable documents to Nanjing to organize its establishment the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the Association received a telegram from Pang Jingzhou saying that a large-scale wounded soldier hospital has been established in a certain place, with a capacity of 5,000 beds. The doctors and nurses in the hospital are the best of their time, but the number is still insufficient. Those who are good at surgical medical care are requested to quickly go to serve, and there will be a considerable salary. However, not only is the supply of clothing and medicines unable to meet the demand, but it is also difficult to purchase. The various circles are requested to donate as soon as possible in order to wipe it out as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>To Preserve National Resources, Property in Zhabei Should Be Shipped Out Immediately</h3>
<p>Garrison Authorities Issue Three Points to Note</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Shanghai War this time, Zhabei was the first to enter the fire line, resulting in a large number of public and private property that could not be shipped out. Now that the war is prolonged, and the enemy believes that our fortifications are extremely solid, artillery planes have been constantly bombing in recent days. Although the military equipment has not been damaged, public and private buildings have been innocently affected everywhere. In order to preserve national resources, it is urgent to devise a way to transport important property to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. However, the Zhabei war has been extremely fierce in recent days, and vehicles are inconvenient to travel to and from. According to the garrison authorities, when talking to the reporter of the Central News Agency, those who want to transport public and private property from Zhabei should pay attention to the following points: ① In recent days, enemy aircraft have been constantly reconnaissance and bombing in the air. Transport vehicles are very large targets, so be sure to pay special attention to avoiding enemy aircraft targets. Those related to military vehicle equipment may not go to transport them; ② Anyone who wants to transport public and private property should first register with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The transportation time and order must be agreed with the garrison authorities in advance; ③ Transportation drivers must have responsible proof to prevent spies from mixing in to detect military intelligence. In addition, for private small property, such as boxes, cages, furniture, etc., it is not advisable to take risks to transport them at this time.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Committee Meeting; Poland Abets Aggression</h3>
<p>League of Nations Does Not Intend to Label Japan as Aggressor; Advisory Committee Will Only Offer Suggestions</p>
<p>[Geneva] The identification work of the thirteen-nation subcommittee of the League of Nations Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese conflict has ended today. It will begin to consider the conclusions put forward by the Secretariat. The resolution proposed by China's chief representative, Gu Weijun, which requires that Japan be identified as the aggressor in the Sino-Japanese War, will probably encounter great opposition. It is feared that the Advisory Committee will adjourn after submitting suggestions without submitting a resolution. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The subcommittee of the Sino-Japanese issue advisory committee of the League of Nations held a non-public meeting this morning to review the first two parts of the memorandum prepared by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, but no conclusions have been reached. It is heard that the memorandum has a total of seventeen pages, and only eight pages were reviewed today. At the meeting, the Polish representative continued to oppose China's proposal and had constant verbal battles with China's chief representative, Dr. Gu Weijun. According to a certain representative who told reporters, the Polish representative's attitude this morning completely favored Japan. There are rumors that since the Japanese military investigation team visited Poland, a military agreement between Japan and Poland has been established. As for the work of the Advisory Committee, it may not be completed by tomorrow night. Therefore, the General Assembly will be postponed until the committee obtains results before closing. The subcommittee held meetings in the afternoon and evening today. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The thirteen-nation subcommittee of the Sino-Japanese issue advisory committee of the League of Nations General Assembly has been discussing whether or not the word "aggression" should be included in the final conclusion of the report on the Sino-Japanese issue for days, and no decision has been made. The subcommittee held two meetings yesterday afternoon and evening to draft the full text of the report. At that time, the Polish representative opposed including the word "aggression" in the conclusion of the report. The Chairman of the subcommittee, Latvian Foreign Minister Munds, argued that the word "aggression" should be included, but the Polish representative Gamarniksky repeatedly spoke out, expressing his inability to accept it. After the meeting closed, the Chinese representative criticized it in the conference rest room, even saying that the Polish representative's attitude was no different from that of the Japanese representative. As for the Australian representative Bruce, when the Advisory Committee discussed the resolution condemning the Japanese bombing some days ago, he originally took a reserved attitude towards the situation in the Far East. At that time, there were two different views on the resolution of the Advisory Committee. The Chinese delegation argued that the words "condemn Japan" should be used, and the Soviet Union and New Zealand agreed. However, the British and Australian representatives argued to avoid using the word "Japan." In the end, the Committee adopted the Belgian representative's proposal to use the words "condemn the Japanese air force." The Australian representative Bruce did not refuse, but recently Bruce received a telegram from the Australian General Federation of Trade Unions and the Australian National Federation of Comrades, and his attitude has changed significantly. It is heard that the Australian General Federation of Trade Unions telegram said that all 800,000 Australian workers unanimously advocate collective resistance to Japanese acts of aggression, and decided that if the League of Nations cannot implement collective resistance, Australian workers will implement a boycott of Japanese goods. As for the telegram from the Australian National Federation of Comrades, it said that the number of members has greatly increased in recent weeks. As the general election of the Australian House of Representatives is imminent, public opinion is of great importance to the position of the Australian government. Therefore, after Bruce received the above two telegrams, he had to slightly change his attitude. Among the British overseas autonomous regions, only Australia and New Zealand have the closest relationship with the Far East, and Australia has always advocated the Pacific collective security system. Now, if the attitude of the Australian representative has evolved and taken a strong stance against Japan, it will have a significant impact on the attitude of the British Empire's Far East policy.

<h3>British Labour Party Congress Condemns Japanese Brutality</h3>
<p>Passes Resolution Advocating Boycott of Japanese Goods, Demands Government Ban Aid to Japan</p>
<p>[London] The British Labour Party today unanimously passed a resolution advocating a boycott of Japanese goods, demanding that the government ban loans to Japan and the supply of munitions to Japan, and issued a declaration condemning Japan's acts of war against China. The declaration stated that the Party deeply regrets the massacre of innocent Chinese people engaged in peaceful work on land and sea, and that the indifference of various countries to Japan's barbaric behavior endangers our security and world civilization. (4th National Telegram) ⊙Bournemouth. The National Executive Committee of the Labour Party met here today. Major Attlee, Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, delivered a speech on the boycott of Japanese goods, stating that all civilized countries in the world have expressed indignation at Japan's barbaric behavior. Japan's economy is inherently fragile, so a boycott of Japanese goods could be successful if implemented effectively. "The current world situation is unsatisfactory, and Britain bears most of the responsibility because the British government has consistently appeased the international situation in the past and has always been unwilling to prescribe the right medicine. For example, Japan's invasion of Northeast China, Italy's plunder of Abyssinia, and a certain country's armed intervention in the Spanish civil war are all obvious acts of aggression, but the British government has always turned a deaf ear to these true facts. In short, the facts that are happening in China today are a direct result of the British government's policies on collective security and disarmament. The British government's authorities only know how to sympathize with the imperialist countries of Japan and Italy, and do not know that the cause of peace must be based on social justice," reported Zhongshi News Agency on the 3rd from Havas.</p>
<p>[London] The Labour Party's annual conference is scheduled to open tomorrow in the city of Bournemouth. The Party's National Executive Committee held a meeting in the city today and passed a motion on the Far East situation, preparing to submit it to the conference for discussion. The content of the motion advocates that Parliament should immediately reconvene to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue. (The British Parliament was originally scheduled to reconvene on the 21st of this month, and will work with other countries to take various economic measures to stop Japan's actions against China.) It is said that "Major Attlee, Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, recently requested that Parliament convene early to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue, so that various necessary measures can be taken to safeguard international law and stop the shameful atrocities that violate humanitarianism. This move is warmly welcomed by the conference. The Chinese people are engaged in peaceful occupations on land and sea, and have no defensive capabilities, yet they have been brutally massacred. The conference deeply hates and abhors this kind of atrocity. If other countries continue to turn a blind eye to this barbaric method of warfare, it will inevitably endanger world civilization and the safety of the people of those countries. Therefore, these countries should no longer appease. The conference condemns Japan's planned acts of war against China for many years without provocation, and demands that the British government: 1. prohibit its citizens from selling munitions to Japan or lending money to Japan; 2. cooperate with other member states of the League of Nations and the United States to put economic and financial pressure on Japan to stop its aggression against China; 3. from a humanitarian standpoint, provide medical and other assistance to the Chinese people. In addition, the conference also calls on the people of the country to refuse to buy Japanese goods in order to oppose Japan's barbaric behavior." The Parliamentary Labour Party also held a meeting today to ratify Chairman Attlee's request that Parliament reconvene early. (Central News Agency, 3rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Decides to Help China Prevent Epidemics</h3>

The 300,000 Swiss francs currently deposited in the League of Nations Secretariat should be immediately allocated for China's epidemic prevention. 3. The member states of the League of Nations should be asked to donate a total of 400,000 francs. The above three items total 2,000,000 Swiss francs. (Central News Agency, 3rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Budget Committee today passed a resolution to allocate £100,000 for medical relief in China. Elliot, the British Secretary of State for Scotland, represented Britain in supporting the resolution. Indian representative Brand stated, "The Indian people are deeply saddened by the suffering of the Chinese people. If the League of Nations declares adjournment without providing any practical assistance to China, the Indian people will be greatly angered." (Central News Agency, 4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>American Scholars Advocate International Cooperation to Restrain Japan</h3>
<p>If Traffic with Japan is Cut Off, the War Can be Stopped Within Three Months</p>
<p>[Washington] The American Foreign Policy Research Association today published a speech given last Friday in Philadelphia by American international affairs expert Pierre, advocating that the United States should adopt a tough policy towards Japan. He said, "Today's three major dictatorial countries cannot wage a war with any strong country with certainty due to a lack of raw materials. If these three dictatorial countries are allowed to take the opportunity to seize the land of neighboring countries rich in raw materials, then the United States' national defense situation will be very different from that of today, which takes a proactive policy to stop the war." Pierre also said that today's American people all hope for peace and avoid war, but avoiding war is the most urgent task. However, it is unacceptable to avoid war by putting the United States in an unjust position and allowing the United States to tolerate the terrorist atrocities committed by Japan in China. Moreover, there is no way to stop Japan's aggression against China without getting involved in the whirlpool of war. In his view, the United States should cooperate with other strong countries to cut off the navigation of Japanese ships so that Japan cannot obtain various raw materials. If countries can implement this action, then even without sending any naval and air forces to the Far East, the credibility of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Non-Aggression Pact can be re-established, because the current Sino-Japanese war can be stopped in no more than three months. Furthermore, the United States adopts this policy because it cooperates with other countries, so there is no need to worry about being retaliated against by Japan alone. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Washington Star said in an editorial today that Americans have always regarded Japan as a polite, humble, and loving country. Now, seeing Japan's wanton slaughter in China and the bombing of civilians in Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangzhou, Americans are almost astonished and cannot help but suspect that the Japanese nation is a demon who only likes to kill people.

<h3>British Public Assembly Draws Much Attention in Japan</h3>
<p>Asahi Shimbun Publishes Warning</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Asahi Shimbun, which has always been known for being pro-British, also published an article on the 4th warning Britain not to hurt Japanese feelings, but the wording was more tactful. Japan seems to attach importance to the public assembly sponsored by the British News Chronicle, so various newspapers expressed their opinions in advance. The All-Japan Anglican Church held a representative assembly with 150 representatives, and resolved to send a telegram to the Archbishop of Canterbury in England, asking him not to attend the public assembly. The intention is the same. (Central News Agency, 4th Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The Archbishop of Canterbury did not express his willingness to comply with the request from the Bishop of the English Church in southern Tokyo not to attend the Albert Hall lecture. The Albert Hall lecture is intended to advocate sanctions against Japan. Anti-government newspapers are still full of letters attacking Japan's invasion of China. However, in some respects, it is felt that this kind of attack will only enrage the Japanese military authorities. In the absence of direct intervention, it is feared that it will do more harm than good to China. (Central News Agency, 4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry Controls Trade</h3>
<p>Three Methods Decided</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Trade Council of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry held a meeting this morning to adjust the international balance of payments and maintain domestic supply, and decided on two temporary measures for import and export goods: 1. restrict imports, 2. prohibit imports, and 3. prohibit exports. The first category includes 20 kinds of goods such as wool, wood, sugar, and yarn ends. The second category includes more than 600 kinds of goods such as Chinese wine, fur, and leather, each containing many items, covering all aspects of supplies. The third category was not announced at the time of the power generation announcement. (Central News Agency, 4th Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Commentator Observes the Future</h3>
<p>Advocates Emergency Preparations</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Chugai Commercial News published two articles by the famous commentator Tsumura Hidematsu on "Emergency Preparations," which are very interesting and suggestive. The article observes from the perspectives of short-term and long-term warfare. In terms of short-term warfare, Japan's national essence is excellent, and it is easy to achieve national unity in wartime. However, if post-war negotiations with China cannot guarantee conditions for permanent peace in the East, then the people will definitely be furious. There may be no major obstacles to making North China completely autonomous and independent, but Shanghai's interests are complex, and it seems difficult to form the situation that Japan expects. Therefore, post-war negotiations are even more difficult than war. At this time, the whole country should seek foolproof strategies. In terms of long-term warfare, the entire domestic political and economic system should be strengthened. What should be started as soon as possible is foreign debt and expanding productivity to reach a level of non-deficiency. Even if efforts are made, it will take some time to maintain a suitable international balance of payments, let alone maintain foreign exchange benchmarks. Therefore, it is very necessary to send financial envoys to the United States to negotiate sincerely. American Jewish chaebols may have no reason not to invest in Japan, and foreign debt is also indispensable for mainland management after the war. (Central News Agency, 4th Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Emperor Hosts Soviet Ambassador</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Emperor hosted a banquet for Soviet Russian Ambassador Slavsky at the Hommeiden Palace at 12:30 p.m. on the 4th. At that time, Prince Lee (of Korea) also attended the banquet. In addition, Palace Minister Matsudaira, Foreign Minister Hiroda, military attache Usami, and close associates were also invited to accompany the Emperor.

<h3>US Government Merchant Ships Operate on New Lines</h3>
<p>Avoiding Dangerous Areas</p>
<p>[Washington] According to the Shipping Commission, US government-owned merchant ships will now operate on new routes in order to avoid dangerous areas in China and Spain. Except when it is necessary to transport evacuees out of the country, US government ships will not lightly enter dangerous areas. (Central News Agency, 4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Six US peace groups, currently initiated by the War Resisters League, are scheduled to hold a joint conference on the 6th of this month to decide on policies on the Sino-Japanese issue.

<h3>Germany and Italy Build New Submarines</h3>
<p>Fourteen Launched</p>
<p>⊙Kiel, Germany. The third team of newly built German submarines, with fourteen submarines, was launched at this port today and named the Lieutenant Commander Loos Team. According to Lieutenant Commander Loos, he was a famous German submarine commander during the European War (Central News Agency, 4th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Content of British and French Notes</h3>
<p>Advocating Withdrawal of Volunteer Soldiers</p>
<p>[London] Britain and France yesterday presented a joint note to the Italian government, inviting Italy to hold talks to discuss the non-intervention issue in the Spanish Civil War. According to British diplomatic sources, the note first stated that after the Nyon Conference formulated the Mediterranean surveillance measures, naval experts from Britain, France, and Italy also established an agreement in Paris. Therefore, regarding the Spanish Civil War, Britain, France, and Italy naturally have hopes for further mutual cooperation. Recently, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and the country's ambassador to Switzerland, Bofa Scobel, have both provided assurances that Italy does not intend to continue sending volunteers to Spain, nor does it intend to change the territorial system of the Balearic Islands in Spanish territory for private gain. This is very gratifying to Britain and France. However, if various acts of interference in the Spanish Civil War can be terminated, and if volunteer soldiers from various countries can withdraw from Spain, then the international situation will naturally ease. Britain and France have encountered countless difficulties in strictly adhering to the non-intervention policy. If volunteer soldiers from various countries are not allowed to withdraw from Spain in large numbers, then the difficulties felt by Britain and France will increase even more. Conversely, once the volunteer soldiers withdraw, then other issues, especially the recognition of the two parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups, can be submitted for discussion. As for the original talks between Britain, France, and Italy, they are preliminary in nature, and the results obtained will be submitted to the London Adjustment Committee for approval, which is only natural. (Central News Agency, 3rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The Soviet government recently sent a note to Lord Plantons, Chairman of the Coordination Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War, stating that the surveillance measures for non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War have been lost. British diplomatic sources now believe that this Soviet note is not very important. If such criticism had been made several months ago, it might have caused a disturbance, but given the current situation, the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War may be immediately reconsidered, and it is not known. Therefore, even if the Soviet Union has objections at this time, it is no longer important. (Central News Agency, 4th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Situation in Palestine Remains Tense</h3>
<p>Religious Leader Advises Resumption of Business</p>
<p>⊙Jerusalem. Although no serious incidents have occurred in Palestine to date, the situation is quite tense. A group of Arab youths in the Old City of Jerusalem patrolled the city in the morning, forcibly closing shops, causing a great disturbance. Police chased after the inspectors and advised merchants to operate with peace of mind, which was very busy. The New City was not affected. There was a strike movement in Jaffa, and the situation remained tense. Many Arabs opened their shops in the morning, but closed them one after another due to intimidation. The Port of Jaffa is currently closed. At the same time, all Arab shops in Safed remained closed. There were rifle shots in three directions today, all fired at Jewish residential areas, but there were no casualties. Haifa was as quiet as usual. The Muslim leader, who has been secluded in the Omar Mosque, issued a statement today advising the Arabs to resume business. (Central News Agency, 3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Fascists Parade and Demonstrate</h3>
<p>Anti-Fascists Disrupt</p>
<p>[London] More than 2,000 members of the British Fascist Party, led by the party leader Sir Mosley, held a rally in the Southwark district this afternoon for one hour and thirty minutes. When the party leaders took the stage to give speeches, anti-fascists booed and threw objects at them, and the order was very chaotic. After the meeting, the party members paraded in formation under police protection. They clashed with several thousand anti-fascists, resulting in eighteen injuries. The police stepped in to suppress the situation and arrested more than sixty people. In addition, when party members from various places went to the meeting today, anti-fascists intercepted them on the way and clashed with the police. Many people were arrested.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Soliciting Military Supplies</h3>
<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>In this large-scale modern war, our army has demonstrated several basic conditions for victory: careful deployment, agile action, strict discipline, and strong morale. This has not only frightened the enemy, but has also been unanimously praised by people from various friendly countries.</p>
<p>However, we must not shy away from saying that our army's material conditions are still very difficult compared to the enemy. Although our military authorities have long made thorough preparations for the supply of various mobilized troops, due to various unexpected reasons during the war, the distribution of military supplies ultimately cannot be without a sense of "slow to meet the need" and "demand exceeding supply." Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the people near the war zone to provide as much material assistance as possible to the troops fighting in the front lines at any time.</p>
<p>Recently, our reporter learned from the front lines that a certain unit that is currently fighting bravely is in great need of several items. Therefore, we are soliciting these items from the citizens on behalf of the unit in the newspaper (see news on page 6). We hope that our compatriots in this port will understand the responsibility of assisting the army and enthusiastically donate so that the responsible authorities can transport them to the front lines to benefit the military.</p>

<h3>Implementing Three Major Movements on National Day</h3>
<p>Anti-Enemy Support Conference Decision: Comforting Frontline Soldiers Movement, Soliciting National Salvation Bonds Movement, Economic Severance with Japan Movement</p>
<p>The Propaganda Committee of the Anti-Enemy Support Association believes that the National Day commemoration this time coincides with the period of China's war of resistance against Japan. All National Day commemoration methods should adapt to the environment and needs of this extraordinary period to enhance the strength of the war of resistance and safeguard national survival. It is proposed to mobilize the people of the country to implement three major movements: comforting, soliciting bonds, and severing relations. This has been submitted to the presidium for review and approval, and it has been determined that the Comforting Movement will be mobilized by the Comforting Committee, the Bond Solicitation Movement will be mobilized by the National Salvation Bond Association, and the Severance Movement will be mobilized by the Propaganda Committee. Working together and actively promoting, the latest situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Comforting Movement</p>
<p>The Double Tenth Festival is the anniversary of the founding of our country. The frontline soldiers are fighting to safeguard the survival of the country, wearing armor and holding weapons, and their hard work and merits are great. On the National Day commemoration day, mobilizing the people of the country to purchase goods to comfort the frontline soldiers who are protecting the country is of great significance. It not only enhances the patriotic sentiment of the people, but also encourages the soldiers to fight bravely and kill the enemy. The Comforting Association of the Anti-Enemy Support Association in this city has specially solicited 100,000 cotton vests, and the Citizens' Federation of the First Special Zone has solicited 100,000 comforting bags to comfort the frontline soldiers. In addition, dozens of anti-enemy commemorative flags are prepared, and one is given to each unit based on the division or independent brigade to commend their military exploits. At that time, representatives will be sent to solemnly deliver them. In addition, Mr. Du Yuesheng, chairman of the association, personally donated 30,000 cotton vests to comfort the fighting soldiers, and 4,000 hygiene shirts to comfort the wounded officers and soldiers. The Cotton Fabric Industry Association also generously donated 2,000 sets of short shirts and trousers for the wounded soldiers. Their righteousness and courage are admirable. Now that the Double Tenth Festival is approaching, the Comforting Association has been very busy with the solicitation and preparation work in recent days. We hope that patriotic people will donate as soon as possible so that they can be sent together at that time to boost morale.</p>
<p>Bond Solicitation Movement</p>
<p>Soliciting national salvation bonds is the most basic and effective method to resist the enemy and save the country, and expanding its solicitation movement on National Day to make it universal and in-depth is of profound significance. Now, in addition to the originally planned solicitation teams from various professional industries, the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Association is planning to divide the city into several districts horizontally, each district into several sections, and each section into schools, shops, and neighborhoods. The solicitation teams from various circles will separately mobilize, distribute subscription books, and widely solicit subscriptions. At that time, special publications will be published, broadcasts will be made, propaganda teams will be sent, and slogans and leaflets will be printed to carry out activities in various aspects.</p>
<p>Severance Movement</p>
<p>Japanese imperialism has been continuously invading Chinese territory, bombing Chinese civilians, and burning, killing, and looting for many years, which is inhumane. There has long been no diplomatic relationship to speak of. This time, it is even more violent and brutal, killing innocent people, arousing the anger of the world. The movement to boycott Japanese goods and sever economic relations has been widely supported and is popular in Europe and the Americas. While friendly countries are actively carrying out the boycott movement against Japan, we have been silent. Although the enemy has blockaded the Chinese coast, there is still a great possibility that enemy goods will be imported. Therefore, it is decided to implement economic severance with Japan from the standpoint of the people on National Day, convene representatives from various groups to form a committee, produce an executive body, widely advocate, and strictly supervise to ensure that all financial, trade, employment, and cultural relations are completely severed. Regarding the organization of the committee, the presidium of the Anti-Enemy Association has been pushing people to prepare actively.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds Released to Treasury: 50 Million Yuan</h3>

The third group is responsible for Fengyu Lane, Hongquan Lane, Bali Paris New Village. The fourth group is responsible for Ximen Road, Sanrangfang, Jiwufang, Sanqing Lane, and Zixiang Lane. The solicitation will be carried out starting today.</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng's Broadcast Last Night</h3>
<p>Appeal for Cotton Vests and National Salvation Bonds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association Propaganda Committee specially invited Chairman Du Yuesheng to broadcast to the national public at 7:00 PM last night via the Sino-Western Radio Station to appeal for donations of cotton vests and subscriptions to national salvation bonds. The gist of his speech was: "Fellow listeners, the biggest goal of my broadcast today is twofold. First, I hope all Shanghai citizens will unanimously donate cotton vests, with a minimum of 300,000 pieces, to be transported to the front lines and distributed to the soldiers. The price is only 65.5 cents per piece due to our wholesale purchase. The sizes fully comply with government regulations. You can make them yourselves, or if you don't have the time, donate cash and send it to the Shanghai Comfort Committee, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, or the Shanghai Local Association, all of which can handle the donation and delivery on your behalf. Donors of 50 or more cotton vests can have their names printed on each vest. The second point is to appeal for national salvation bonds. The Shanghai Local Association is entrusted by the National Salvation Bond Fundraising Association to establish the Shanghai Citizens Fundraising Brigade, divided into eight groups, including the Nanshi urban area group, the Public Concession First Special Zone group, and the French Concession Second Special Zone group. The main task of these three groups is to solicit donations from residential households. I hope that all citizens, every family, will purchase a certain amount of national salvation bonds as a minimum. Based on the calculation of 400,000 households in Shanghai, a huge sum of money can be raised."</p>
<h3>Securities Clients Facing Settlement Difficulties; Ministry Orders Investigation and Reporting</h3>
<p>Clients Failing to Complete Settlements; Deadline Set for Reporting and Drafting Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange Brokers Association, due to its inability to complete the public bond settlement on schedule, resolved at a meeting to have the chairman do his utmost to find a way out of the difficulties. Several days have passed since then. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance requires each broker to collect and report the names of entrusted clients who are unable to complete the settlement within a deadline, and then to consider measures. The association has already notified its affiliated brokers to comply with the order and complete the reporting procedures. The letter states: "Greetings, previously, we received an order from the Ministry of Finance that the transactions for the September period should be settled as scheduled. We convened a general meeting of all members twice on September 28th and 29th. Due to the impact of the war and financial constraints, it was difficult to proceed. It was resolved to request the board of directors to ask the Ministry of Finance for a postponement. Now, according to the board of directors, the Ministry of Finance cannot change its decision on the settlement. The names and amounts of the entrusted clients with settlement difficulties should be listed in detail and submitted to the association for compilation. Therefore, we are enclosing a form for your completion and submission to the association (no later than the morning of October 4th). Please do not delay."</p>
<h3>Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>Quantity Needed Is Extremely Large; Hope for Continuous Donations</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Comfort Committee launched the cotton vest collection campaign, donations from all parties have been exceptionally enthusiastic. However, this is a full-scale war of resistance, and the quantity needed is extremely large. It is hoped that all sectors will continue to sew the remaining fabrics and make "Anti-Enemy Shoes" to donate to the soldiers. In addition, only 60,000 first-aid kits have been received, and it is hoped that more donations will be made to meet the urgent need. The receiving locations for comfort items are: Kuling Road, Jing Shi An Hua Mian Li Cotton Fabric Association; Beijing Road, Shilu East, Crepe Public Office; Zhonghui Building, Shanghai Local Association; Yu Qiaqing Road, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Those Who Have Pledged Donations Are Urged to Expedite Production</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Scout Troop undertook the task of soliciting cotton vests for the soldiers fighting the war, with the efforts of the troop members and the enthusiastic contributions from all parties, significant achievements have been made in less than a fortnight. The troop originally set a target of 10,000 pieces. According to the settlement yesterday, 20,386 pieces have already been collected, exceeding the original target by more than double. Among them, Qin Zhongyao raised 1,860 pieces and Lu Bingzhang raised 1,503 pieces, achieving the best results. There are still a large number in production. It is now heard that the troop, in order to expedite the completion for application purposes, urges all those who have pledged donations to the troop to expedite production and send them to the troop headquarters. If transportation is inconvenient, please call 95444 to notify the troop to send someone to pick them up.</p>

The remaining planes, seeing the situation was unfavorable, fled in panic. Our planes did not pursue and safely returned to their defense. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Conclusions of the League of Nations Subcommittee Report</h3>
<p>The Word "Aggression" Is Not Included; Our Country's Representative Argues on Principle</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Advisory Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to meet tomorrow morning to discuss the report submitted by the 13-nation subcommittee. It is not impossible for the League of Nations General Assembly to discuss the Far East issue tomorrow afternoon. (Central News Agency, Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The 13-nation subcommittee of the League of Nations Advisory Committee held two consecutive meetings this afternoon to draft a report. The process took a very long time. A portion of the conclusions was drafted, and the content was to record the following facts: 1) Japanese naval, land and air forces invaded Chinese territory; 2) Japanese air force bombed Chinese cities; 3) Japanese navy restricted Chinese coastal navigation. However, the words "aggression" and "blockade" were not included. This is because, legally speaking, there can be no blockade without a state of war, and China and Japan have not formally declared war. The subcommittee then continued its meeting at 9:30 PM in the evening to draft conclusions stating that Japan had violated various international treaties, especially the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Peace Pact. The meeting had not adjourned as of the time of the telegram. According to the British delegation, "The main conclusion to be presented by the subcommittee will tacitly condemn Japan's acts of aggression, but the Chinese representative Gu Weijun seems to have decided to fight to the end and will not give up until the League of Nations clearly condemns Japan's acts of aggression, in order to comfort the expectations of the Chinese people." The following is a supplementary record of the subcommittee's meeting this afternoon: Polish representative Gamarnik said that the report drafted by the subcommittee should not make any conclusions. The French representative replied that conclusions should be based on proven facts, and this is the main task of the subcommittee. The subcommittee then discussed the draft submitted by the chairman, Latvian Foreign Minister Munters, and the amendments submitted by the British representative. Chinese representative Gu Weijun largely agreed with the British proposals, but insisted that the conclusions submitted by the subcommittee must be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly in the form of a draft resolution for adoption, otherwise it would not be possible for all member states to formally accept and be bound by it. (Central News Agency, Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Seventy Chinese residents here paid a visit to the chief Chinese representative Gu Weijun tonight before the Advisory Subcommittee meeting to present a petition requesting 1) that he strive to have the Thirteen-Nation Subcommittee clearly condemn Japan's acts of aggression, and 2) that if satisfactory results cannot be obtained in this regard, the League of Nations' assistance to China's epidemic prevention project of 1,000,000 Swiss francs should be rejected. Gu replied that he would do his best to negotiate in order to achieve the goal of clearly condemning Japan. Gu then attended the meeting of the Thirteen-Nation Subcommittee and delivered an impassioned speech, demanding that the aggressor nation be "directly denounced as an aggressor nation and stripped of its mask and condemned." (Central News Agency, Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Chinese delegation to the League of Nations recently issued a press release stating that "Regarding the indiscriminate bombing of Chinese cities without defensive fortifications by the Japanese air force, the League of Nations Advisory Committee and the League of Nations General Assembly have already passed resolutions on October 27th and 28th respectively to solemnly condemn it, but the Japanese army ignores it and continues to adopt this barbaric method of warfare." In addition, the Chinese delegation expressed satisfaction with the League of Nations' decision to assist China's epidemic prevention project with 2,000,000 Swiss francs, and stated that this move had no political significance.

<p>[Washington] According to sources from Shanghai, Chinese officials recently notified the US naval authorities that the wharves of Yantai Port in Shandong Province may be destroyed to prevent Japanese troops from landing, and therefore requested that the US destroyer fleet leave Yantai Port within 48 hours. The US State Department and the Navy Department both said that they were unaware of this. (Central News Agency, Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>All Sectors of Japanese Public Opinion Unanimously Condemn the Military</h3>
<p>Tokyo Chamber of Commerce Raises Questions; Major Changes Expected at the Parliamentary Session</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A certain foreign observer recently came to China from Japan. According to him, the Japanese army's offensive in Shanghai has been repeatedly unsuccessful, and all sectors of Japanese public opinion are unanimously condemning the military. When the war in Shanghai first broke out, the military repeatedly stated that the war had just begun, that the military strength had not yet been fully mobilized, and that the military future was certain, and boldly guaranteed to all sectors that they would definitely occupy a certain area after a certain number of days. However, for the past forty or fifty days, the facts shown to the Japanese people have been completely contrary to what they said. The war is ambiguous and protracted, the military is fruitless, the domestic finance is gradually becoming unstable, the resentment of the financial community is deepening, and the international accusations are pouring in, which makes all parties more and more dissatisfied. Recently, the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce has therefore taken the lead in raising three questions to the military: 1) What is the necessity of the war against China? 2) Why is the military strength mobilization unable to respond to military opportunities during the war, so that the military plan cannot be completed as scheduled? 3) If the war is prolonged, how will it be dealt with in the future? The military's propaganda is often contradictory, and even the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Imperial Household is unable to justify these issues. The radical elements on the left believe that the current war plan and international propaganda are extremely outdated, and are particularly indignant. It is now heard that the Privy Council is observing the situation and may advance the issue of responsibility. It is likely that the opening of the parliament on December 21st will be a key turning point. The military is now hoping to obtain a solution before this period. If China is determined to persist in the war, a political change will inevitably occur in Japan at that time. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Bloody Battles West of Luodian; Enemy and We Are Still Locked in Stalemate at Shi Xiangong Temple</h3>
<p>Enemy's Main Force Fiercely Attacks Guangfu Town and Is Defeated; We Have Solid Fortifications on the South Bank of the Wenzaobang; Fierce Artillery Battles in Zhabei; Our Front Line Remains Unmoved</p>
<p>For days, the enemy has been fiercely attacking our Zhabei positions with heavy troops, attempting to cut off our connection with Jiangwan, in order to achieve their goal of a quick victory. Our army is inherently advantageous in street fighting. The enemy relies solely on the cover of tanks. Our army uses the cover of buildings, takes a high position and frequently fires with machine guns and grenades. The enemy has left piles of corpses, but has never been able to cross our front line. A certain foreign military expert witnessed our loyal and brave soldiers killing enemies like flies in a certain place, and praised us endlessly after returning, saying that our army is intelligent and brave, and Zhabei is a copper wall and iron wall that the enemy cannot easily touch. The following is the front line news obtained by this newspaper at 2:00 PM today: 1) In the Luodian area, the enemy, with forces of two regiments or more, attacked our new positions from different directions. Our army responded calmly and the enemy repeatedly advanced and failed, and ultimately could not succeed. They are currently still in a stalemate at Shi Xiangong Temple. The enemy's airplanes and artillery bombings have almost never stopped for a moment, but our positions stand firm. 2) The enemy concentrated their attack on Guangfu Town between Luodian and Liuhang and were repeatedly repelled by us. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. 3) The battles south of Liuhang Gujiazhai are focused on the vicinity of the Wenzaobang. Our army has built extremely solid defensive fortifications on the south bank of the river, and it is impossible for the enemy to cross it secretly. 4) Enemy planes wantonly dropped bombs in Dachang and Miaohang this morning, but our positions were undamaged. 5) In the Zhabei area, the enemy's offensive has been severely hit. This morning, it seemed that most of the enemy troops were unable to attack again. Although small teams harassed us from time to time, it was irrelevant to the overall situation. Our positions have not changed at all. Enemy airplanes and artillery have been constantly bombing our Zhabei positions since dawn this morning, and our heavy artillery has also returned fire. The artillery battles had not stopped by noon.</p>
<p>Central News Agency said: Our accompanying reporter reported at 12:30 PM on the 5th that the fierce battles in two places in Zhabei had not stopped. Our side has a clear advantage and has crossed the railway line to the east, approaching North Sichuan Road. The enemy is retreating step by step and has transferred 3,000 reinforcements from Jiangwan in an attempt to hold on stubbornly, and is wantonly bombing with airplanes and artillery. There should be more fierce battles tonight.</p>
<h3>The Battle Situation in Luodian and Liuhang Is Fierce</h3>
<p>The Enemy's Attack on Our East Positions in Guangfu Was Unsuccessful; The Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses in Shenjiawan and Wujiazha</p>
<p>On the line from Luodian to Liuhang to Wenzaobang, the enemy has been fighting hard for months and has suffered heavy casualties. They had to transfer troops stationed in the city center to supplement this area in an attempt to sustain it. Therefore, for the past two days, the enemy has been continuously concentrating bombings on our positions in the Liuhang area day and night, using airplanes and artillery, causing damage to some of our fortifications. Our army is now holding firmly to its positions in the Guangfu Town area. Last night and this morning, the enemy launched several fierce attacks on our east positions in Guangfu Town from the area of ​​Xinmuqiao and Zhangjiazhai, but were repelled by us with extremely fierce firepower. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. As for the position of ​​Shi Xiangong Temple in the Luodian area, our enemy is still facing off. However, since last night, a large team of enemy elite troops, under the cover of tanks and artillery, has been pouncing on our positions from Shenjiawan and Wujiazha. Our army responded calmly and waited for the enemy to approach a considerable distance, and then our troops jumped out of the trenches and launched a fierce hand-to-hand combat. The enemy's tanks were ineffective under the concentrated fierce bombardment of our hand grenades and small steel cannons. The fierce battle continued all night until this morning. Our army's positions still stood firm. The enemy left piles of corpses and suffered extremely heavy casualties. As for the enemy north of Wenzaobang, they were trying to cross the river south, but our positions in that area are extremely solid and the enemy will definitely not succeed.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting at Zhabei and Jiangwan</h3>
<p>The Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses for Three Days; Enemy Forces at Jiangwan and Lujiakou Suffered Great Defeats</p>
<p>In the Zhabei area, the fighting has been intense for days, continuing day and night without interruption. Last night until this morning, there were intermittent artillery battles between our forces and the enemy, and the sounds of rifles and machine guns could also be heard constantly. There was also fierce fighting near Baoshan Road and North Sichuan Road, with gun and artillery fire continuing throughout the night. From 6:00 AM this morning, enemy warships in the Huangpu River opened fire on the North Station area, and we returned fire. Between 6:00 AM and 10:00 AM, the artillery battle was fierce in the section between North Station and Maigen Road Station. The enemy camp at the Japanese primary school on North Sichuan Road was hit by our artillery shells, causing significant damage. According to a certain military expert, more than a thousand enemy infantry soldiers have been sacrificed in the past three days while charging against our machine gun fire and grenades. Although our side has also suffered losses from the enemy's heavy artillery and aircraft bombing, most of the damage has been to civilian houses, with no military damage whatsoever. Therefore, not only has our military front line not been shaken, but our troops have also repeatedly charged through the enemy's positions. As a result, when enemy infantry see our troops coming out of the trenches to fight, they all tremble and retreat. A certain gentleman also produced a piece of ridiculous leaflet scattered in the sky by enemy aircraft this morning, with various illustrations, etc. Our military and civilian hearts are as firm as iron and stone, and we will never stop until we have annihilated the enemy. Furthermore, up to 1:00 PM, enemy aircraft were still carrying out intense bombing, and the rumbling sound was heard throughout Shanghai. At dawn this morning, about one company of the enemy in the Jiangwan area made a move near Lujiakou, attacking our army's positions at Yeyuan. They first fired fiercely with machine guns. Seeing that our army was motionless, they crawled forward. When they were about 300 meters away, our battalion of soldiers rushed out of the trenches and launched a massive attack. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered more than half casualties, and the remaining troops lost their will to fight and retreated in panic, with corpses scattered everywhere and in a miserable state. Our troops pursued them to the vicinity of Lujiakou before returning to their positions at ease.</p>
<h3>Enemy Giant Aircraft Bombs Zhabei</h3>
<p>At 11:30 AM, two squadrons of enemy giant heavy bombers, a total of six aircraft, arrived in the Zhabei area and dropped bombs, indiscriminately bombing. One squadron dropped more than a dozen bombs over North Station, while the other squadron seemed to drop dozens of bombs in the northeast of Baoshan Road. The sound of the explosions was very loud. Our troops remained calm as usual. At 12:45 PM, after our side fired anti-aircraft guns at a squadron of enemy aircraft over North Station, they drove eastward.</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, at 9:50 AM this morning, the enemy suddenly released a black, giant balloon in the Liuhe area, reaching a height of more than 3,000 meters in the sky. The reporter observed it with the most precise telescope from the roof of a tall building on the Bund, and saw that the balloon was in the shape of an olive, with a leather chair hanging below, occupied by three people. Under the chair was a long rope, hanging straight to the ground. One of the three people, wearing a white uniform, seemed to be using some kind of telecommunications tool to communicate with the enemy forces underground, looking very busy. The other two also held binoculars and looked around, seemingly to scout the situation in various places. It did not descend until about 11:00 AM. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, which has lasted for nearly two months, this is the first time the enemy has used balloons, which shows that the enemy is at the end of their wits and strength. According to a certain military expert, the purpose of the enemy's use of the latest scientific war tools this time is purely to scout our military positions and provide the enemy with bombing targets, and there is no other major function.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Massacres Women, Children and Farmers</h3>
<p>More than Twenty People Bombed to Death in Dachang and Zhenru</p>
<p>Starting from dawn yesterday, more than 50 enemy aircraft hovered over the Dachang and Zhenru areas, bombing non-combatants. In one place in Dachang, more than 30 bombs were dropped, killing more than 20 civilians, all of whom were women, children, and the elderly. Enemy aircraft dropped a large number of bombs on those picking cotton and harvesting rice in the fields.</p>
<h3>Enemy Transport Ships Carry Military Supplies to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Docking at the Northern Bund of the China Merchants Bureau to Unload</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships that have successively sailed to Shanghai in recent days, in addition to the Shinyo Maru still docked at buoy No. 16, the Haguro Maru and Meigen Maru are docked at the Huangpu Wharf, and the Ikuta Maru is docked at the central bund of the China Merchants Bureau. Because the military supplies they carried have not been completely unloaded, they have not yet sailed out. The other transport ships, such as the Xing'an Maru, Haruharu Maru, and Toyokawa Maru, which arrived yesterday, have successively sailed out of Songkou and returned to Japan last night. As of this morning (5th), only one transport ship, the Chimiy, fully loaded with military supplies and ammunition, has arrived and docked at the northern bund of the China Merchants Bureau, and is currently being unloaded one after another.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Steal Our People's Belongings</h3>
<p>The Yangshupu District is Emptied</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas have fallen into the line of fire. The area is full of factories and residences, and commerce is extremely prosperous, but because the disaster struck suddenly, all items in residences, factories, and stores could not be transported out in time. The areas were once opened to allow foreigners to enter and move out belongings. According to foreigners who went to the area, all steel plates, iron plates, lathes, machine parts, and fine belongings of residents, calligraphy and paintings, and merchandise of stores have been taken away by the enemy troops. The violent enemy is extremely fierce and evil, and military discipline is gone. This can be seen in general. According to Japan, in all the concessions in our country, all the properties of Japanese residents were properly protected by our side when the Japanese residents evacuated this time, without any damage. Compared to the former, it can be seen that the national character of the enemy and our country are completely different.</p>
<h3>Brief Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Germany and Japan have signed an anti-communist pact, and have repeatedly made joint anti-communist demands on us. It is said that this use of troops against China is partly to carry out their continental policy, and partly to prevent the Soviet Union from invading the south. Japan has always regarded the Soviet Union as an unforgettable enemy. However, while the use of troops against China is in a difficult situation, the Japanese Emperor suddenly held a banquet in the Fengming Hall of the Imperial Palace to entertain the Soviet Ambassador, Mr. Slav. After the banquet, tea and snacks were served in the peony garden. The banquet was so abrupt, and the attitude was so cordial. It is a long skill for the enemy to hide their ferocious faces and smile obsequiously. The enemy's prowess in diplomacy is known to the world, and this can also be seen. I wonder what Mr. Slav thinks of this? What do the Soviet Union and the public think of this? If a cup of wine can really dispel suspicions, the world would have been peaceful long ago.</p>

<h3>An Estimate of Japan's Army Strength</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>In 1914, the Japanese army barely expanded to 19 divisions. In 1915, it added another two divisions. At that time, the content and organization of the army were completely old-fashioned. By 1918, with Russia as its enemy and with the aim of invading China, it decided to expand the divisions and increase its strength. Therefore, the Terauchi Cabinet established the 22nd Army (44 divisions) and the fortress preparation plan. In 1919, during the era of the Hara Takashi Cabinet, due to the influence of the Tanaka Memorial, military expenditure was greatly increased. When the war ended, the equipment of the Russian army was greatly renewed. Japan abandoned the principle of "expanding the quantity of troops" and imitated Russia's equipment improvement policy, starting from the "enrichment of troop quality". In 1920, a budget of 486 million yuan was established, and it was increased to 560 million yuan the following year. However, due to the lack of domestic financial resources, it was strongly opposed by the parliament, and the original plan was reduced by 40 million yuan. In 1922, the so-called "Yamanashi Military Reorganization Plan" was suddenly passed by the parliament. As a result of the reorganization, the total number of personnel was reduced, with 54,000 soldiers and 13,000 horses, approximately reducing the strength of five divisions. Since then, after the reorganization in 1924, 252 infantry companies, 29 cavalry companies, 101 artillery companies, 7 engineer companies, and 9 transport companies were formed. However, while one side was being reduced, the other side was still seeking improvement, such as the infantry team being equipped with light machine guns and infantry artillery, and a small number of heavy artillery teams. This can only be regarded as a semi-new and old army. Later, a major earthquake occurred, and the financial situation became increasingly poor. There was no time to restore the country, so how could there be surplus energy to expand? Therefore, in 1925, it was reduced to 17 divisions again, adding two tank companies, ten flying squadrons, six anti-aircraft artillery squadrons, two observation squadrons, and one balloon squadron. Later, after repeated requests from the army, the budget was increased, and a ten-year expansion plan was established. From the Showa 1928 to 1932, two-thirds of the planned programs were completed. They felt that their strength was sufficient, began to invade China, and wanted to realize the first step of the Tanaka Memorial's continental policy and create the Manchurian Incident. Since 1935, a new military equipment enrichment plan has been determined to balance with Russia's military equipment. That is: 1. Enhance the military strength in Manchuria, 2. Expand aviation, 3. Enrich various military and political facilities, 4. Improve operational data. Up to now, the so-called standing army on the surface is still 17 divisions, with a number of 230,000. In fact, the number of troops has been secretly expanded to 25 divisions. As for the types of soldiers, there are: ㊀ 15 field artillery regiments (90 companies), ㊁ 4 mountain artillery regiments and 1 battalion (90 companies), ㊂ 70 infantry regiments and 6 battalions (730 companies), ㊃ 25 cavalry regiments (70 companies), ㊄ 1 cavalry artillery battalion (22 companies), ㊅ 8 field heavy artillery regiments (11 companies), ㊆ 3 heavy artillery regiments and 8 independent companies (34 platoons), ㊇ 17 engineer battalions (48 companies), ㊈ railway soldier group (16 companies), ㊉ signal soldier group (15 companies), ㊉㊀ 8 aviation regiments (26 companies), ㊉㊁ 1 balloon soldier battalion (2 companies), ㊉㊂ 15 transport soldier battalions (30 companies), ㊉㊃ 1 anti-aircraft artillery team (4 companies), ㊉㊄ 1 tank team. The above are the peacetime regulations for army personnel and organization. In wartime, they claim to be able to summon 2 million people from the countryside. However, since the seizure of the four northeastern provinces, in order to prevent the Soviet Union and to deal with the volunteer army in various parts of the Northeast, 100,000 soldiers have been transferred from the domestic army to the Northeast. When the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, 60,000 to 70,000 elite soldiers were transferred to Peiping and Tianjin. Another 40,000 to 50,000 soldiers were assigned to Korea, Taiwan, and the South Pacific Islands to undertake local defense. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, almost all of the 70,000 to 80,000 soldiers remaining in the country were transferred to the front line of the invasion.</p>
<h3>Brief News from Jiashan</h3>
<p>In the three refugee camps in Qingpu, Zhujiajiao, Zhangliantang, and Jinze, more than 300 to 400 war-stricken compatriots are accommodated every day. Recently, cases of acute cholera have been discovered, with patients vomiting and diarrhea, dying within just three hours. The disease has even spread to local residents, and is rampant. In Jinze alone, more than 40 people die every day. In the refugee camp in Xitang Town, this county, refugees transferred from Zhangliantang and Jinze have all been found to have epidemics. Chinese and Western doctors are rushing to diagnose and treat them, with almost no time to rest. Nearby residents have also been infected.</p>
<p>The county government of this county has ordered the township offices to collect scrap copper and iron. As of the 2nd, the weight of those delivered to the county government for storage reached about 30,000 catties.</p>
<p>The Qingfu Department of the County Government of this county has completed the Qingzhang of the Land Administration Department and created a new series for the 26th year based on the Qingzhang results. Since the opening of the levy on September 1, the grain households have been actively paying to the counter. The number of receipts in the first ten days was more than 1,000 yuan, the number of receipts in the middle ten days was more than 3,000 yuan, and the number of receipts at the end of the ten days was more than 10,000 yuan. In addition, a national salvation donation of five jiao per mu will be levied under the field rent item in this year. The Anti-Enemy Support Association of this county decided to donate one month of rent for all shops and houses in the county, to be paid in August and September, borne by the landlord, and paid by the tenants on behalf of them. Those with monthly rent within two yuan are exempt from donation. The collection started on the 1st of this month.</p>
<h3>The Autumn Weather Cools Down, True Cholera is Slightly Killed</h3>
<p>Would Not Have Been Discovered Without Warfare; The Epidemic is Not as Severe as in the 21st Year</p>
<p>According to reports from the Datong News Agency, the number of cholera cases discovered in this port has decreased due to the recent cooler weather. According to a survey by the Seaport Quarantine Office, the most severe cholera outbreaks this year were in Hong Kong and Shanghai, followed by Guangzhou. It is said that Ningbo, Wuhu, and Henan also have cholera outbreaks. However, in general, the extent of the epidemic and the number of cases are not as severe as in the 21st year of the Republic of China. In that year, the number of cases reached 100,000, and the epidemic spread to 22 provinces and cities. Moreover, the cholera in Shanghai in that year was first discovered in April, while this year it was delayed until mid-August. Therefore, according to general judgment, if there were no war relations this year, the strictness of the anti-epidemic barrier of the Shanghai health authorities could have prevented the discovery of cholera.</p>
<h3>Yangshupu and Hongkou Continue to Open for One Week</h3>
<p>Allowing Foreigners to Move Property; Chinese Property is Not Allowed to be Moved Out</p>
<p>After the enemy troops blockaded the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas, foreigners negotiated with the enemy military authorities through consuls of various countries to open the areas twice to relocate property. However, because the time was too short and the procedures were troublesome, only a small number of people moved out. After further negotiations by the consuls, it was decided to open the areas again for one week, from today to the 11th, still from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day. However, the route is stipulated to enter from the Waibaidu Bridge and exit from the Zhapu Road Bridge, so as not to block the vehicles. Starting this morning, foreigners have been rushing to the Japanese Consulate to collect registration certificates and go to move property. However, the enemy troops still do not allow all Chinese property in the area to be moved out.</p>
<h3>Car Dealers Should Pay Attention to the Cleanliness and Safety of Vehicles</h3>
<p>And Encourage the Purchase of National Salvation Bonds</p>
<p>The Special District Office of the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Guild issued two notices for rectification of vehicles and solicitation of national salvation bonds: ㊀ The Public Works Bureau is scheduled to inspect rickshaws starting from October 1. After repeated negotiations by the representatives of this office, it has been agreed to postpone the inspection. However, from now on, all car dealers must conduct thorough rectification of vehicles on their own and pay attention to cleanliness and safety, so as not to give others an excuse. If the car factories do not rectify on their own, the Public Works Bureau will implement the cancellation of licenses, which will affect business. Do not say that you were not warned. This is a matter of vital interest, so please do not wait and see and delay yourselves. ㊁ This office is now concentrating its efforts to negotiate the inspection of vehicles and the suspension of the payment of mutual aid association fees. The license fee of two yuan and nine cents and the association fee of one jiao for the month of October for each car dealer will be paid to the Guohua Bank Baxianqiao Branch from now on (if car dealers have not paid the association fee for September, they must pay it to the office when they receive the license) so that after the negotiation, the license can be donated. Furthermore, regarding the national salvation bonds, it has been decided that each vehicle will donate one yuan. In order to facilitate the car dealers, it will be paid in two installments in October and November, with each vehicle paying 50 cents of national currency per month, which will also be collected by the Guohua Bank and a special account for national salvation savings will be opened so that it can be exchanged for national salvation bonds in the future. This is a matter of national salvation, so it is hoped that you will actively contribute. This is most important.</p>
<h3>The Huangpu River Had a High Tide Once Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Tide Even Overflowed Onto the Bund; There Will Be a High Tide Again This Afternoon</p>
<p>Before 1:00 PM yesterday, the Huangpu River had a high tide, reaching about 13 feet, causing a section of the road surface on North Suzhou Road Gansu Road to be overflowed by the high tide, and the road surface was a vast expanse of water. Pedestrians had to take detours. Other places such as Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, and Guangxi Road also suffered from water accumulation on the road surface due to water overflowing from the drains, and it took a long time to recede. It is said that there will be a high tide again this afternoon.</p>
<h3>A Tour of Zhabei</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>The Enemy Finds it Difficult to Succeed in This Small Place; The Enemy's Fighting Mood Has Been Strengthened for a Long Time</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, this newspaper's reporter went to the Zhabei area for a few hours of touring. When I stepped onto the north shore, I saw broken walls and ruins, and the scene was bleak. However, the mood of resistance against the war and the calmness of the people that I saw along the way made me believe that the final victory will belong to us. Although enemy aircraft and enemy bombs can destroy our superficial buildings, they will not be able to destroy the anti-war spirit hidden in our entire nation. Even with the anti-war experience of our loyal soldiers in the past five days, not only did they inflict heavy damage on the enemy, but they also gave the world a great surprise and admiration. The Zhabei area can be called a small place. Because of the long-term transportation relations, it has created its considerable importance. Therefore, at the beginning of this war, the enemy army tried its best to seize it. Thanks to the valiant defense of our soldiers, it has not been succeeded by the enemy army, and considerable progress has been made. However, the enemy's attempt has not been slightly reduced. They have left a large number of aircraft and dense artillery fire to bomb every day. As a result, there is no military damage to us. Since September 28, the enemy army, with the strength of its newly added reinforcements, began its so-called fourth general offensive. In the Zhabei area, the enemy army, in view of the heavy casualties it has suffered in the past, hopes to avoid the golden peak and concentrates its main forces in the North Sichuan Road area, and dozens of tanks, under the cover of the firepower of dozens of enemy artillery on Broadway Road, launched a fierce counterattack on our Qiujiang Road and Baoxing Road strongholds. On the one hand, they used small units to harass along the line, in order to contain our military strength. However, our army has already seen through the tricks of the jumping beam bugs, and took the opportunity to kill them painfully, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage. In recent days, more than a thousand enemies have been killed. All the main roads along Qiujiang Road, North Sichuan Road, and Yokohama Henan are in the hands of our army, and the shooting standards of our artillery are especially frightening to the enemy. The enemy army knows that the artillery bombardment is naive, so it constantly uses aircraft as the target of measurement. After a burst of indiscriminate bombing, it will send its infantry to commit crimes. However, once our army counterattacks, they will immediately flee. The enemy sees that there is no gap to take advantage of, so it uses its artillery to indiscriminately bomb our side. However, as soon as our artillery team counterattacks, the enemy disappears, just like a stereotyped article. The enemy's lack of skills is even more convincing. And the calmness and strong strength of our front-line soldiers make the enemy army fear them. However, looking at their offensive plan, it seems that they want to break through our Qiujiang Road and Baoxing Road line, in order to suppress our Baziqiao and Baoshan Road positions. Yesterday, the enemy committed a fierce crime against the Qiujiang Road area all day long. The fierceness of the artillery fire was unprecedented. Our strength is strong and the soldiers are obedient. We have repeatedly defeated the enemy and inflicted heavy damage on them. Moreover, our army's anti-war front is closely connected, and the positions are consolidated. The enemy's attacks will be wiped out by us. The patriotic girls' school on Jiangwan Road has been searched and advanced by our army after the enemy army retreated. Looking at the enemy army's retreat from the city center, and the sudden intensification of the war in Liuhang and Zhabei, it seems that the troops that have been withdrawn have been supplemented on the two lines of Liuhang and Zhabei, and the heavy casualties of the enemy army and the difficulty of assistance are becoming more and more obvious. However, the enemy army has a hundred tricks, and often uses a general group of unconscionable traitors to spread rumors for no reason, hoping to disrupt the rear. I hope that the people will not disturb themselves and fall into the enemy's tricks. They should also rise up to take strict precautions and impose sanctions, so that our front-line resistance can proceed smoothly, and all unnecessary rumors will be eliminated. Furthermore, I hope that everyone will contribute all their talents, material resources, and manpower to the country. The so-called "those who have money contribute money, and those who have strength contribute strength" will make our strength stronger, and we will undoubtedly control the final victory. We can also be worthy of the loyal and valiant soldiers who are fighting on our front.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Hawaii Enthusiastically Raise Donations</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported on August 21 that a dispatch from Honolulu said that the overseas Chinese in Hawaii unanimously and enthusiastically support the government of their motherland in the war of resistance against Japan, and are now working hard to raise money and materials to help their country for the purpose of resisting the enemy. On August 19, representatives of 40 groups held a meeting to form a support association for resisting the enemy, and raised donations separately. They raised 10,000 yuan in Chinese currency on the same day, which was remitted yesterday. The association expects to raise at least 250,000 yuan. At the same time, youth leaders have formed another association, most of whom are American citizens. The association is named the Chinese Medical Relief Committee, and its purpose is to transport medical supplies to various hospitals in Shanghai. On the first day, it raised US$1,400, which will be used to purchase medical supplies and transport them to China. During the war, it plans to raise donations and transport them at any time. Three days ago, the local Kuomintang raised 10,000 yuan in Chinese currency and remitted it to the government of their motherland. Many overseas Chinese here are responsible for monthly donations during the war. Their patriotic enthusiasm is commendable.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Chen Zhenwu Comes to Shanghai to Form an Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Zhenwu, an overseas Chinese, recently traveled from Hong Kong to Guangzhou at the invitation of Mr. Xie Denan, took the Yuehan train to Han, turned to Beijing to meet with military authorities and friends in Beijing, and has now arrived in Shanghai, temporarily residing in Xie's mansion. In recent days, he has been negotiating with Huang Jianzhong, Lin Qingchi, and other gentlemen from the Overseas Chinese Federation on matters such as forming an overseas Chinese volunteer army and going to the South Pacific Islands to solicit national salvation bonds. It is said that there is quite a bit of headway, and he will go to Beijing in the near future for some negotiations. It is also said that the South Pacific Islands are very enthusiastic about the full-scale war of resistance of the motherland and the purchase of bonds.</p>
<h3>Female Staff of the Special No. 1 District Court Guardhouse Makes Comfort Items</h3>
<p>Sewing Cotton Vests Overnight to Comfort Loyal and Valiant Soldiers</p>
<p>Wang Baosan, warden of the guardhouse of the Shanghai First Special District Court, greatly admired the brave killing of the enemy by our front-line soldiers, inflicting heavy damage on the bandits. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, he, together with Section Chief Hui Erfu, persuaded colleagues to freely donate comfort relief funds. It is said that they have already sent the funds to Huaxing and other radio stations and various collection points. The first batch of national salvation bonds, more than 60 yuan, was also ordered from the Baxianqiao Bank of China on the 5th. Recently, as the weather has gradually turned cold, they have raised 40 cotton vests, which were personally sewn by the female staff of the guardhouse, Li Meihun, Fan Xin'an, Zhu Fengjin, etc., according to the style in the newspapers and magazines, after their work. Yesterday, they were rushed to the Shanghai Comfort Committee to be forwarded to the front. It is hoped that all sectors of society will follow suit and donate, and the future of the war of resistance will surely be a full victory.</p>
<h3>Survey of Damage to Businesses in Wusong, Jiangwan, and Pudong</h3>
<p>To be Handled by Branch Offices of the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Since the Wusong, Jiangwan, and Pudong areas of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce have fallen into the war zone, businesses have been unable to operate and have had to relocate temporarily. Now, in order to seek mutual liaison, the branch offices are proceeding with the relocation registration and investigating the damage to businesses in each area. The Jiangwan branch office has already started handling it on the 27th of last month. The Wusong and Pudong branch offices will also start handling it.</p>

<h3>Frontline Bound</h3>
<p>— Jin Jian</p>
<p>It was a deep night, the earth draped in a black cloak, dimming even the moon's radiance. The weather was cold, with wind.</p>
<p>We had been serving in this ×× hospital for over a month. Tonight, we were to go to the front lines to undertake guard duty.</p>
<p>"To the front lines?" These four words had been a hope lingering in my mind for over a month, and today it was to be fulfilled. How delighted, how joyous I was!</p>
<p>My heart was ablaze, boiling like water in an old stove pot, every blood cell drilled into my heart, crowding, crowding!</p>
<p>A dozen or so companions, gathered at the entrance, awaited the truck. The clock seemed to be playing tricks on us, moving particularly slowly tonight; five minutes, ten minutes, slipped by quickly, and finally the truck arrived. We loaded the luggage piece by piece. When we were all swallowed up by the truck, it slowly began to crawl.</p>
<p>The truck drove really fast, like an electric hare at a dog track. After a few turns, it headed straight for ××.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the truck's lights went out. At that moment, we could still hear the "creak, creak" of machine guns. It bravely groped forward in the darkness. The hearts of the dozen or so of us were also stilled.</p>
<p>As the long hand of the illuminated watch passed a quarter of an hour, the truck plunged into a deep pit. If I hadn't touched my own head, I would have believed I was no longer among the living.</p>
<p>A dozen or so people, with everyone lending a hand, dragged the truck out of the pit, and it continued onward.</p>
<p>The chaotic sounds of gunfire and artillery told us that we were nearing our destination. At this moment, what kind of expectations were hidden in our hearts!</p>
<p>When the truck stopped, we unloaded our luggage and entered a solemn-looking building.</p>
<p>We went inside, rested for a while, and later we were assigned to ×× to perform guard duty. Six people per day, divided into three shifts, two people per shift, the same at night.</p>
<p>On the third day of my duty, we saw a Jiangbei person being brought in. According to a patrol guard, this Jiangbei person was being used by the enemy to scout military intelligence. Many documents were found on him, and he had a sun-like mark tattooed on his arm.</p>
<p>A week later, I was transferred back.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Peace</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yixiang</p>
<p>Everyone agrees that peace in the Far East is the cornerstone of world peace.</p>
<p>Many people have discussed the question of how to strive for peace in the Far East. Here, the author offers a few personal observations;</p>
<p>We should take a proactive stance, concentrate a strong force, resist nations with aggressive ambitions, drive out the Japanese imperialists who are taking advantage of the situation, build a great beacon of peace, and lead all weak nations that need peace. This is the first means of striving for peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>International disputes are by no means simple matters, but rather very complex events. Therefore, to safeguard world peace, we must use various diplomatic means to join hands with peaceful nations along the Pacific coast to consolidate the cornerstone of peace in the Far East. At the same time, we should form a line with them to make the forces of peace stronger and more extensive, and organize a headquarters of peace to weaken nations with aggressive ambitions. This is the second means of seeking peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>History tells us that the more humiliated China is, the more rampant the imperialists become. The fall of the four northeastern provinces is a good example. Therefore, if we want to achieve the goal of peace, then we must take decisive action: fight a life-and-death battle with Japanese imperialism. This is the third means of seeking peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>If we can truly achieve the above three means, then the cornerstone of peace in the Far East will not be difficult to stabilize: that is, true world peace will be easier to achieve.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, this publication will attach "Wartime Youth" as an evening edition starting from the second issue. We hope all sectors will pay attention!</p>
<p>"Wartime Youth" also accepts external manuscripts, but only those that adhere to the purpose of this publication and are concise and incisive. Submissions should be sent to the Editorial Section of the Propaganda Department of the Youth Wartime Service Corps at 178 Tianjin Road. Please do not send them directly to this office to avoid delays in forwarding.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Stipulates Refund Methods for Various Schools</h3>
<p>Specialized Schools Resume Classes One After Another</p>
<p>The Shanghai Social Bureau's Special Order No. 1013 states: Having examined that some primary and secondary schools in this city have collected various fees due for the first semester of the 26th year from students before the outbreak of the war, and now the schools have either relocated to other places for classes or have not yet started classes, all fees paid by students of schools that have not yet started classes should be refunded. The following is stipulated: ㊀ For various fees collected from students by municipal primary and secondary schools, if the school has not started classes by October 10, they should be fully refunded by the original receipt location (school or bank) upon presentation of the original receipt. Schools that have already started classes should also fully refund fees to students who have not attended classes ㊁ Private primary and secondary schools, except for those that have already started classes and have been approved by this bureau for refunds, should immediately refund the fees paid by students. However, necessary expenses incurred in preparing for the start of classes may be deducted from the tuition fee, up to a maximum of 10%. All primary and secondary schools must comply with this announcement.</p>
<p>Jinan University</p>
<p>National Jinan University, using 826 Xiaoshadu Road as a temporary school building, is scheduled to collect fees and register on the 6th and 7th (Wednesday and Thursday), and classes will start on time on the 11th (Monday).</p>
<p>Patriotic Girls' School</p>
<p>The original school building of Shanghai Patriotic Girls' School has been destroyed. It is now renting two large buildings at the intersection of Nanyang Road and Hart Road to start classes. There are special preferential measures for female students in war-stricken areas.</p>
<p>Liangjiang Women's Normal School</p>
<p>Liangjiang Women's Normal School has moved to the new school building at 319 Qiqi Road in the French Concession and has already started registration. Classes start on the 5th.</p>
