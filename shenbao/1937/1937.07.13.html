<h3>撒兵談判聲中日軍一再違約施攻擊</h3>
<p>昨夜進攻財神廟業經我軍擊退　我以日無誠意宛城駐軍亦開回　香月飛前線視察召各將領會議　關東軍携大量軍火源源運抵津</p>
<p>［北平］今夜十時、大井村日軍以大砲機槍向財神廟我軍進攻被擊退、豐台日軍今夜又向蘆溝橋增防（十二急電）</p>
<p>［北平］大井村日軍、於十二晚十時許、向財神廟進攻、（按財神廳距平市廣安門約五華里）、我駐該地之軍隊、事前早有準備、當予以猛烈之還擊、雙方砲擊約三十分鐘、日軍不支、旋卽退去（十二日中央社電）</p>
<p>［北平］今晚宛平一帶機關槍聲、復轤轤不絕、因此北平市民在稍覺安逸之後、復現緊張神色、（中央社十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［北平］十二晚十時、前方又發生接觸、槍砲聲密集、迄發電時未止、（十二日中央社電）</p>
<p>［北平］中日本約定同時撤兵、但日並無誠意、祇撤去少數部隊、經我方催促、反謂我違約前進、現局勢確又趨嚴重、（十二日中央社電）</p>
<p>［北平］日軍十二晚八時、又突向我軍攻擊、（十二日專電）</p>
<p>［天津］香月十二日十一時二十分、偕橋本•和知•大木•等幕僚、飛蘆溝橋•宛平•偵察、並到豐台、召河邊等前方將領會義、大局能否和平、端視渠此行用意如何、（十二日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］秦德純•馮治安•張自忠等、各要人、昨終宵會商應付時局辦法、迄今晨六時始散、今晨陳覺生•魏宗翰•松井•今井•林耕宇等、磋商解决蘆溝橋事件和平辦法、雙方口頭約定、仍屨行前約、雙方撤兵、蘆溝橋日軍已大部撤回豐台、陳覺生今午赴津謁宋、報告一切、宋俟與香月會晤後、卽由津返平、日方屢次連約、此次是否履行諾言、尚待事實證明、（十二日專電）</p>

<p>［天津］蘆溝橋正面高地、猶有日軍步砲兵二百餘未撤、其機關槍陣地移進鐵道旁、頃前方尚平靖、（十二日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］官息、昨晚中日雙方口頭約定停戰撤兵、昨夜今晨日軍突又開槍攻擊、此應由日方負責、我因希望和平解决、倘日方不願信義、仍進逼不已、我軍决取正當防禦、日兵百三十餘名、今晨携輕重機槍六架抵平、據稱係由蘆溝橋撤回豐臺後、轉來平、逕開日兵營、據午後息、日在蘆溝橋軍隊、尚未完全撤退、關東軍有數列車入關、第一列今午已抵津、恐時局隨時均有惡化可能、（十二日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］中日撤兵談判、十二日仍繼續舉行、但我方因日軍屢次食言、不撤退盧溝橋之部隊、同時證明、日軍繼續徵調、顯欲擴大挑釁行動、故將宛平已撤退之駐軍又復開回、駐紮城廂之保安隊、則協助維持治安、（十二日中央社電）</p>
<p>［北平］十二日午次定雙方派員監視復員從、日方頗多藉口、迄晚猶未施行、雙方距離密邇、成相互警戒之勢、稍一不愼、卽有惡化之可能、故十二日晚局勢仍在嚴重關頭、各方均極注視、（十二日中央社電</p>

<p>［北平］舉世矚目之蘆溝橋事件、本於第二次口頭約定、於十一日實行撤歸原防、嗣我軍已復撤至衙門口（地名）後方一帶、日軍大部亦撤往豐臺方面、惟並未完全撤盡、前方警戒區內、雙方軍隊為警戒起見、因此又有射擊而至互相死傷、形勢轉趨嚴重、十二日下午、雙方當局遂派員各往前綫視察、相互監視實行復員、以期事件早日了結、我方所派為二十七師副師長張凌雲、冀察綏靖公署交通處副處長周永業、廿九軍參謀周思靖•日方所派為櫻井•笠井•中島•張等奉命已於十二日午前往、我方復員現正準備中、日是否實行踐約、尚待續報、至事件發生以來、已歷五日、此間當局始終本不挑釁不喪權不辱國之旨、以促對方之猛省、如日軍再不撤退、則前途如何演變、殊難臆料、（十二日中央社電）</p>
<p>［北平］日本已决定於關東軍方面、抽調大部軍隊、向華北增兵、並由該國另開兩師團、現已有一部士兵登輸待發、（十二日中央社電）</p>
<p>［北平］此間局勢急轉和平、全市戒備漸弛、各城門除外城各門外、前門已全開、宣武和平兩門亦開啟、惟未開直耳、各衝要街道之沙包障碍物、已逐漸撤去、永定門缺口處障碍亦撤除、東車站各次上下車均恢復、僅平通支綫車未開、（十二日中央社電）</p>
<p>［北平］豐台來人談、豐台日軍甚夥、步哨達數里、居民逃避一空、（十二日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］據報告、蘆溝橋方面日軍、已大部撤至豐台、但尚有若干未撤、且有久駐模樣、我方仍希望事態不擴大、惟日軍倘無屢行信約之誠意、仍向我挑釁、則我惟有堅决抵抗、又據路訊、日關東軍决增調二千五百人入關、第一批七百人、已於十二日開抵津、第二批一千八百人、十三日亦可到、隨帶槍械軍實甚多、（十二日中央社電）</p>
<p>［北平］陳覺生離平前談、蘆溝橋事件、已和平解决、今後並可防止不再發生類此情事、至日方軍事上調度、係在事件惡化時準備、現已令全部停止、（十二日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］日方募集在平居留民、組織義勇隊、今日在日本俱樂部報名、（十二日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］蘆案和平解决、父呈惡化、日方十一日與我交涉結果、本允將大井村至蘆溝橋附近各地日軍、撤至豐臺、但其後日軍並未實踐諾言、除十日晚十二日晨一再猛攻我軍陣地外、十二日上午起仍在原陣地佈置工事、自劉家口至大井村一帶民房、被佔領多處、或利用田禾為掩護物、或將田禾割去趕築溝壕、由大井村至五里店、日軍警戒尤嚴密、反客為主、檢查行人、大瓦窯及鐵路涵洞、放置大砲及軍馬甚多、僅於十二日下午一時許、將部隊百餘人撤至距豐臺一里許之窪地、另一方面則迭向平津增兵、駐平日軍此次並未參加蘆溝橋之役、但十二日晨仍有百六十餘名運平、由水關下車、入日本兵營、謂係從前方復員之兵、山海關兵車十二日已有五列西上、已運到津之日機有二十餘架、（一說五十餘架）、十二日下午三時、並有關東軍五百餘名携有小鋼砲多尊、分乘大汽車由承德開古北口、分駐石匣等處、其第二批一百五十餘人、亦於十二日下午四時開到、駐在密雲城內、據某觀察家談、日閣議已議决向華北增兵、關東軍及朝鮮軍正紛紛調動、足見欲以强力壓迫華北、以遂行其政策、和平解决及事態不擴大等名詞、或僅其準備未完成時、一種外交辭令、惟我方己有堅决之意志、卽日方茍不踐其諾言、對我挑釁、亦惟有奮起與之周旋、（十二日中央社電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］倫敦人士對於遠東事變、採取鎮靜之態度、市塲方面因購方消乏、各項貨價皆以愼重而稍加低抑、但售方亦不求急售、且以上海形勞安靜之故、中國債券價格降落極微、但日本債券、因日本貨幣限制而無法與東京方面成立公斷比例大為銳落、倫敦方面極望中日間能早日成立和解、因恐者中國將對日貨重起杯葛、轉致日本之採取報復手段耳、（中央社十二日路透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>國際對華應有之新認識</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>此次財政部長孔祥熙。訪問各國。其使命為促進歐美各國對中國之經濟合作。及對中國有正確之新認識。吾人讀近日報章記載之孔氏在美談話。及演說。不但誠懇爽直。無粉飾之外交辭令。且能把新中國進展中最重要的趨勢。向各國說明。本月七日。孔氏對美國數百萬人民之廣播演說。足以糾正一般外國人對華之錯誤觀念。所舉各點。卽本國同胞。亦有澈底了解之必要。</p>
<p>第一。中國之政治前途。非獨裁而為民主。中國近年以來所以尚未獲英美法蘇各國人民之充份同情。因為他們往往誤認中國前途。是走向法西斯蒂式之獨裁政治。卽中國國內。仍有民主或獨裁之爭辯。可謂謬誤。按獨裁政治。蔣委員長早已表示反對。且國民大會行將召集。憲法頒佈在卽。明顯表示。中國將永為民主國家。現在世界民主與獨裁之對峙壁壘。已甚森嚴。或此或彼。無躊躇之餘地。素倡階級獨裁之蘇聯。近亦修正憲法。提倡民治。本月八日蘇聯中央委員會討論選舉法時。認蘇聯憲法。為全世界最民主者。蓋民主為人類最高理想。亦卽中國民族之立國精神。近年雖略受摧折。終獲勝利。所以孔祥熙對美國民衆說。“民主政治為中國四萬萬人團結之最大力量。卽孫逸仙博士三民主義之根基。”孔氏此種解釋。已引起良好之反應。當彼訪問華盛頓之日。華盛頓郵報曾著論督促彼國政府。積極與中國合作。以鞏固國際民主之陣綫。蓋中國為遠東民主勢力之保障。亦和平之偉大力量。美國駐英大使於本月七日演說。痛詆非民主國家。而提倡民主國家之團結。吾人應自信中國將積極為國際民治主義努力。而世界應認識獨裁制度。在中國已根本無生長之可能。</p>
<p>第二。中國的目前努力。是自力更生。抵抗侵略。換言之。中國不是一個無抵抗國家。中國更不是依賴的民族。自九一八以後。吾國喪地頻頻。誤信國聯為可恃。國際間普遍印象。遂以為中國民族缺乏自主力與自衛力。但是淞滬的抗戰。喜峯口的殺敵。綏遠的勝利。以反兩廣問題之和平解决。西安事變之轉禍為福。三中全會後之舉國團結一致。表現抵抗侵略之决心。均可以證明不抵抗主義已根本不存在於中國。當日軍最近侵犯蘆溝橋時候。我們將士便發誓以蘆溝橋為墳墓。死不退却。這種精神。應可以堅吾人之自信與正國際之視聽。數年來的舉國一致埋頭建設。乃是以前依賴政策的反應。親英親日。日內瓦路綫莫斯科路綫。均告失敗。只有自謀統一建設。增强抗敵力量。為吾民族唯一出路。所以孔祥熙氏對美國人民說。“自存自衛自助之精神。為促成中國人民團結之力量。中國一般人士均已感覺必須依賴自己力量與富源。以求生存及决定將來之命運”。</p>
<p>第三。門戶開放始終是中國對外經濟關係的原則。換言之。中國不拒絕任何國之經濟合作。同時中國市塲不能容任何國壟斷或瓜分為勢力範圍。年來以中國關稅之自主。反政府對於本國產業之鼓勵。一些帶有偏見的外人。深忌中國對於外人對華商業。干涉太大。在華之日本報紙。恒以中國關稅過高為譴責。英國報紙則以吾政府干涉出口業為不平。此皆未顧及中國之基本利益之論。中國之對外經濟政策固維持合作互惠原則。未有改變。至於日本思壟斷中國市塲。近更誘英國劃分中國為數勢力範圍。當然非自主自衛之中國所能容忍。門戶開放政策為美國所提出。與中國對外原則。適相符合。故孔祥熙稱此原則為“中美關係之結晶。而中國更準備擴大之為一種開誠佈公與伸手歡迎之政策。”</p>
<p>總之。樹立民主政治培植抗敵力量。接受各國經濟合作。乃是中國的基本國策。凡是獨裁制度。敗北主義。不抵抗主義。依賴政策。銷國政策。壟斷瓜分。都不是中國所需要或中國所願接受的。孔祥熙在美之談話。對於這幾點有正確的說明。世界各國對中國應作如是觀。我們中國人民。更當有如此之自信與自勵。</p>

<h3>某著名法學家駁斥日外省發言人聲明</h3>
<p>日軍在蘆演習毫無法律根據</p>
<p>南京通信、本京某著名法學家、頃對於日外務省發言人七月十日所發表辯護日本駐屯軍在華北演習之聲明、發表其意見如下、</p>
<p>日外務省發言人對於日軍在蘆溝橋附近之軍事演習、似以一九○○年十二月二十二日列強關於庚子事變聯合照會中之第九條及一九○二年七月十五日中國與各國（日本在內）關於交還天津照會之第四款、以為辯護之根據、實則該發言人殆己忘却該列强之聯合照會要求保持北京與海口之交通、係以各國占據若干彼此同意的地點為條件、而此項之同意後、即載入一九○一年九月七日之所謂辛丑條約、計沿北京奉天鐵路共有十二地點、茲有特須注意者、即在此十二地點中、并無自二十四年秋以來、即為日軍所佔之豐台，更無位置在平漢鐵路线上之蘆溝橋、蓋此在平漢线上之蘆溝橋、固與北京至海口之交通、絕無絲毫關係也、日本發言人、殆似又忘却交還天津照會之第四款所謂“田野演習來復槍實習、除實彈演習外、不必知照中國方面”云云、按照誠項照會之規定、亦僅適用於駐在天津之軍隊、天津以外之其他十一地點之軍隊、即不適用、至若干不在北平奉天鐵路线上之蘆溝橋、自更不適用、目所謂田野演習來復槍實習云云、自有限度、不能解釋為如最近兩年來日本悍然不顧中國之嚴重抗議所屢演之大規模的演習也、最後、該法學家以為日本在蘆溝橋之演習、不惟無法律根據、且亦有昧於適可而止之義、去歲九月十八日、旣已非法派遺軍隊至豐台壓迫中國軍隊退出該地矣、則今日在蘆溝橋方面、似亦應稍留餘地、不以演習為掩護、而更予彼間之中國軍隊以難堪、觀於日軍此次之行動、直益使人相信侵略者之行為、絕對無有止境而已（中央社）</p>

<h3>華北局勢混沌滬平交通暫止天津</h3>
<p>兩路局昨停售平聯運票　中國歐亞航機停降北平　海運損失電報郵件照常</p>
<p>蘆溝橋中日兩軍衝突、事態嚴重、滬平間鐵路航空交通、已受影響、均暫以天津為終點、如局勢轉和、隨時即可恢復有綫無綫電報及郵件、仍照常收遞、報務較平日擁擠、記者分向各交通機開、探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>滬平航空變更航站</p>
<p>中國歐亞兩航空公司、滬平間均有定期航班、自蘆溝橋事件發生後、以北平南苑飛行塲、在軍事區域附近、為避免發生意外、及旅客安全計、各該公司對滬平航綫、暫行變更如下、㊀中國航空公司滬平綫、係由上海經南京•海州•靑島•天津•而達北平除星期三•六•北上南下各開快班機外、每星期一•二•四•五•日滬平間、對開一班、昨晨由滬飛平之司汀遜飛機客票、暫行售至天津為止、至津電稱、東局于萬國跑馬塲機塲、被日軍强佔、該公司發言人聲稱、僅見報載、㊁歐亞航空公司平漢平港兩綫、係由北平經太原•鄭州•而過漢口、再經長沙•廣州•而達香港、現公司當局、雖仍發售北平站客票、但須候班機抵達太原探視情形後、隨時决定停降與否、</p>

<p>電報郵件照常收遞</p>
<p>㊀交通部上海電報局、自蘆溝橋事件發生後、滬平間有綫及無綫電報、仍照常暢通、但以各方電平詢問局勢情形、及北平居民電滬上親友、報告現狀之電報突增、故報務較平日繁多、擁擠異常、而尤以新聞電報寫最多、㊁上海郵政局對於寄平各種平•快•航快•等郵件及郵包仍照常收遞、但以中國歐亞兩航空公司郵政暫停降北平站、其遞到時間、將較平日稍緩、</p>
<p>暫停進貨海運損失</p>
<p>此次事件發生後、滬津間海運亦受重大阻礙、蓋天津方面各荘商、俱以時局不靖、為免損失計、曾紛電滬各辦莊、暫停進貨、故昨晨前往海關報運疋頭雜貨等出口赴津者、為數絕少、除一部份載運麺粉米糧等食品之輪給結關外、餘均呈停頓狀態、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>上海人且慢“泰山”</h3>
<p>— 柳倩</p>
<p>上海有句俗語呌做“泰山”，它的解說就是“鎮靜”，大概是師古人“泰山崩於前而色不變”的意思。但這“泰山”的氣質却也不僅上海人為然，凡是中國人都是如此，不過中國人之中上海人表現得特別强烈吧了。</p>
<p>一二八的砲火在閘北轟得鎮天價嚮的時候，租界上的高等華人仍舊“泰山”得很，嫖堂子，進跳舞塲，這是最近的例。這回蘆溝橋的警耗，我方一再容忍，而且人“食言而肥”，仍舊進兵圍襲，要不是二十九軍士兵奮勇抵抗，這以下的局面，將如何設想？雖然現在平津仍是岌岌可危，但這樣一來，對於保衛國土的完整，爭取民族的人格，却是大有帮助。可是在這樣的大熱天，二十九軍士兵浴血苦戰，我們在後方的竟有許多仍舊“泰山”下去。“泰山”下去的原因，並不是他們否認是中國人，他們也知道中國人應該愛中國，但可惜也不過知道而已，他們沒有堅强的信仰，和熱烈的情緒，所以祇是得過且過，希望能够苟且偷安而已。</p>
<p>正因為有了這樣的信念，祇要砲聲遠在華北，子彈不要落在自己的門前，什麼事都可以不管，卽使有一天砲彈落在前門，但後門仍舊可以躱避，他們永不會想到玉石俱焚的日子就在眼前，也永不會想到國家受到災難的時候，她的國民是無可倖免的。事實已經擺在眼前了，平津的砲聲，離上海固是很遠，但上海人是不愁沒有這種耳福的。昨天的報上就這樣記載道：“自蘆溝橋中日軍衝突發生後，日駐滬海軍陸戰隊卽於九日起，連日舉行打靶，似係示威……昨晨四時許，又有陸戰隊四百餘名，自江灣路司令部出營，在施高塔路一帶演習，直至六時半始歸營……”</p>
<p>這演習的用意，當然還不僅是示威，弦外之音，我們是不難想像出來的。上海會不會再遭受像一二八那樣的浩刦，實在也很難說。因為蘆溝橋的戰事一旦擴大，則遭受威脅和騷擾的，將不僅限於平津，全國各地隨時都有殃及的影響，上海人自亦不必再夢想可以苟安。</p>
<p>在國家遭受危難到這樣程度的今日，苟安固是夢想，就連恐懼也是徒然，為了全民族的生存，為了國土的完整，橫在我們面前的，祇有一條路，一條死裏求生的路。現在不是我們——特別是上海人——“泰山”的時候了，“泰山崩於前而色不變，死了也是寃枉的，我們現在應該不分階層積極地準備起來，現在雖然還沒有到人人都上前綫的時候，但我們不能沒有這樣的决心。我以為我們至少應該立刻覺悟把自己的生活規律化起來，停止一切的娛樂和消耗，把我們積存下來的精神和金錢，拿去慰勞前方的將士。一面我們自動組織起來，嚴密偵察漢奸和浪人的活動，因為就已往的經騐來看，“擾亂”是他們的特長，而利用漢奸，又是他們一貫的政策，我們要親到民間去，對那些天眞的愚民講解，使他們了然於人民與國家的關係，使他們不致於受少數金錢的誘惑就出賣國家和民族！</p>
<p>全國的同胞起來，上海的少爺小姐們起來，這不是你們“泰山”的時候了！</p>
<h3>元芳路攤戶加捐的疑問</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>元芳路老街一帶，擺設蔬菜魚肉等攤為生之攤戶，每月向工部局納捐二元，“歷有年所”。近工部局定於本月一日起，更為“每季納捐國幣九元”，並且要“一次繳納”。於是寗波奉化旅滬兩同鄕會據兪如慶等八十餘人來函，致函工部局副總辦何德奎。內云：“該同鄕等均係小本營生，每攤資本大則六七元，小僅二三元之數，藉博蠅利，瞻養全家；加捐已不勝負担，一次繳付，尤覺困難。…經於上月廿六日由敝會轉請工部局俯念該販等實際困難情形，准予維持原狀在案，迄未奉復。而該管捕房忽派員向各販征收捐款，照原捐每月二元征收，該販等以為工部局允准請求，均喜形於色。不料次日捐務處復派員向該販等征收每季每攤九元之捐費，並指前給照會為非法，致羣情惶惑。嗣復向每攤牧回二元之照會，責令領取每季九元之照會。各販以事出兩岐，如依照新章繳納，實有不堪負擔之苦衷；詎捐務人員以武力徵收為壓迫………”</p>
<p>“以武力征收為壓迫”的情形如何，函內未加說明，而新聞紙上亦未有該項記載；想來大家對於這種“壓迫的經騐是頗為豐富的，也不必舉例證明，閉上眼睛一想，“如此這般”的事件就如在目前。現在想說一說的，工部局為什麼突然要增捐、理由雖然沒有說明，大家（各攤戶在內）可以知道工部局近年來經濟支絀，已取銷情報處等於前，以資節流，加捐等情，自然是開源之道了。所以此次情形，比之去年盆湯弄攤警衝突是絕然兩樣的，因為盆湯弄事件的理由是“有碍交通”。</p>
<p>那末加捐就加捐是了，在“上海文化界撤銷租界戲曲電影檢查權運動會籌備會”主席報告中有警句云：“到了租界上，應該忘了你是一個中國人！”（是工部局答覆某主持人的話）元芳路各攤戶等旣到了租界上，自然應該服從此項命令，雖然明知道“加捐已不勝負担，一次繳納，尤覺困難，”不過為了拆棚戶事件，也該忍痛“困難”一次。不是嗎？居住之所的草棚都可以自由拆除而使之“露宿街頭”，加捐是要錢罷了，何得詣之“羣情惶惑”？</p>
<p>不過所發生疑問的是，旣“派員向各販征收捐款，照原捐每月二元征收”</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>之後，復於次日“派員向該販等征收每季每攤九元之捐費，”這不但要“羣情惶惑，”恐怕還是“羣情憤怒”吧？而更懷疑的是，“指前給照會爲非法”；“前給照會”當然也是工部局發給的，如果“前給照會爲非法，”那末這“非法”在工部局，各販攤等是只知繳納了捐錢做賣買—自然不是“非法”的事。</p>
<p>現在兩同鄉會以事屬同鄉法益，除囑該販等静候解决外，特推陳忠臯，董心琴伴同該販等公推代表向工部局面陳困難情形，結果如何，當難逆料。到了租界上，我們自然應該接受人家的命令，不過上面二點疑問，希望工部局能够滿意的答覆我們，這大概不見得問得“非法”吧？</p>
<h3>起來！不願做奴隸的人們！</h3>
<p>— 張鴻飛作</p>
<h3>荷花之什</h3>
<p>— 林吉</p>
<p>在靜穆的鄕间，那漾着綠水的池塘裏，一朶又一朶的荷花開放了………现在已经是炎炎的七月。我無心地打從田塍间走來，聞到荷花的淸香，而那咯咯呌着的靑蛙，不是在奏着愉快的音樂麼？在池塘邊，被赤日熏得發熱的泥土上，我坐了一刻………我凝望着那最鮮艷的一朶。………我從一個過路的農夫的手中借來了一條竹杆，把那一朶荷花探了下來，歡天喜地回家了。</p>
<p>“那里來的荷花吓！”</p>
<p>“我從鄕下帶來的。”</p>
<p>“多美麗！你插在那里呢？”</p>
<p>“在我的花瓶里；放在我的書桌上”</p>
<p>我的書桌上是兩堆雜誌，一長串的小說，一個綠色的檯燈。我把花瓶放到檯燈相反的右邊去，在那里陪伴着她的是一張懸在牆上的狄安娜竇萍（注）的八寸照相。夜里，月光從窗口偷偷地射了進來，我索性熄掉燈，讓那朶花在柔軟的月光里浴着，嫵媚得如同一個聖處女。七月的夜晚，風是微小得連輕薄的窗帘邊吹不動，四週一點聲音也沒有，世界彷彿跌到一個幽谷之中。……我望着荷花；一分鐘，二分鐘，我還是望着荷花……我在荷花的前面回到了舊時的世界，找到了一個也是愛着荷花的人……</p>
<p>這個人和我一樣的年紀，一樣在一個中學校里唸書—我們那中學的校園里，有一個圓形的池塘，每逢夏天，不知道多少荷花，開在那池塘上面，而滿池的水，是被綠色的荷葉蓋着了。在池塘邊，豎有禁止採花的木牌，這使我們很感到悵惘。</p>
<p>我說：“希望能有一朶荷花的權利啊！”</p>
<p>他說：“放在我們的宿舍里，多麼好！”</p>
<p>我說：“我們晚上下手吧。”</p>
<p>他說：“要記大過的……”</p>
<p>但是那一天我去買了一個賤價的花瓶，盛着水；夜里和他一同去偷採一朶荷花。然後，悄悄地溜回宿舍，把花插在瓶里。那一夜也有月光，我們兩個人着了魔似地對着荷花過了三更才睡了去</p>
<p>第二天他給舍監傳去了，記了大過，我却沒有。我去向舍監先生說：“這是我出的主意……”而那舍監先生出乎意料地答道：“不要扯謊，誰都知道他是壞種，不良份子！”留下的只能去向他道歉，他說：“這又何必呢？兩個人記過，不如我一個……”</p>
<p>三年前，也是荷花時節，我從上海回到家鄕，第一件事是採一朶荷花去見我那舊時的同伴。到了他家里，出來迎接的是他的白髪老母親，一見到我就傷心起來，哭訴着她那年靑的兒子死了！……這是怎麼一回事呀，雖然半年不和他通信，人世為什麼變得這樣快？………“他們說我的兒子不安份，勾結土匪，就不明不白地把他從學堂里抓去了！”這使我記起我的故鄕半年前的一次動亂，而此後就不曾有他的消息……</p>
<p>便把那朶荷花帶到那荒草叢中的墳頭，默默地，我獻上了我的祭品，我望着天際—天是多麼高呵。</p>
<p>……而現在又是荷花開放的時節了……我在這朶荷花之前，想起了死去的同伴，和風雨中的故鄕，我把頭伏在桌上了。</p>

<h3>Japanese Envoy Pays Visit to Foreign Minister Wang</h3>
<p>Exchanging Views on the Lugouqiao Incident; British and American Diplomats Inquire into the Truth</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Because the Japanese army intentionally expanded the Lugouqiao Incident, and battles have occurred daily, our side, for self-defense, and because Japan is invading our territory, will not hesitate to sacrifice anything and will engage with them. The situation today is recorded as follows: 1. At 10:45 AM on the 12th, Japanese Embassy Counselor Hidaka, accompanied by Army Deputy Military Attaché Ōkido and Navy Deputy Military Attaché Nakahara, visited Foreign Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the Lugouqiao Incident and exchange opinions. They left at 12:00 PM. Both sides held the same hope for stopping military actions and avoiding escalating the situation. 2. After Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, arrived in Tianjin from his hometown of Leling, he spoke with Ji Shijun, head of the 29th Army's Beijing Office, by telephone on the 12th. Zhu hoped that the Japanese army would not make repeated mistakes, plunging the Far East situation into an unmanageable state. He believed that the recent actions of the Japanese army were intended to expand the conflict. Li Shijun met with Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin at 10:30 AM on the 12th to report. After Song returned north from his hometown, he met with visitors and said with a resolute attitude, "Although I continue to receive reports today, they are not yet detailed, but I will not fall for their delaying tactics. Our army's determination to defend our territory is strengthened by the enemy's repeated illegal attacks." Li then spoke with Qin Dechun, the mayor of Beiping, and wished Qin well for the sake of the country. In the afternoon, he again visited Xu Yongchang, Director of the Military Affairs Commission's Office, to make a report. 3. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, while en route to the United States, was extremely concerned about the situation in North China due to the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident. He decided to expedite his return to China. He ended his meetings abroad and left New York on the 11th aboard the French mail ship Normandie, bound for France before transferring onward. When leaving the United States, he telegraphed Nanjing and Shanghai, expressing concern about the situation, and stated that he would depart for China no later than early August. His original plan to recuperate in Germany has been abandoned. 4. Because the Japanese army has repeatedly attacked our army, causing casualties and local losses, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes it is necessary to investigate the various circumstances to prepare for future negotiations. The personnel sent include two Ministry of Foreign Affairs staff members and one Ministry of Foreign Affairs advisor, all of whom have considerable reputations in diplomatic circles. After receiving their orders, the two men arrived in Tianjin on the 11th and in Beiping on the 12th to meet with relevant authorities and begin their investigation work. 5. Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, diplomats from various countries stationed in Beijing have been extremely concerned. British Embassy Secretary Beddington visited Director Li Dijun of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 AM on the 12th. American Embassy Secretary Acheson also visited Li at 3:00 PM on the 12th, expressing extreme concern about the fighting in the suburbs of Beiping. 6. In the afternoon of the 12th, various agencies in Nanjing received conflicting reports about the situation in Beiping, making it difficult to ascertain the truth. After Li spoke with Beiping at 3:10 PM, it was learned that there had been no major battles from 3:00 AM to the time of the call. It was also learned that while the Japanese side was mobilizing reinforcements, they were also discussing peace. Therefore, the news subsided again in the afternoon. It is generally expected that the Japanese army is cunningly plotting, or perhaps it is another delaying tactic. 7. Li Shijun received a telegram from Qin Dechun on the morning of the 12th, which read, "Both your telegrams regarding the situation are noted. 1. The Japanese army launched another fierce attack on our garrison at Lugouqiao at 7:00 PM last night. Our forces responded calmly and have not yet yielded. The two sides are currently in a state of confrontation. 2. The other side has repeatedly expressed a willingness to reconcile, and we are currently discussing the withdrawal of troops to their original defenses to peacefully resolve the situation. Twenty trains of Kwantung Army troops have arrived at Shanhaiguan and intend to head west by train, but this has been firmly rejected by our Beining Railway Bureau. Details to follow. Qin Dechun (Special Dispatch on the 12th)"</p>
<h3>Tense Atmosphere in Tokyo Resembles Wartime</h3>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Explains Policy Towards China; Newspapers Comment on the Dispatch of Troops</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Since the morning of the 11th, Minister of the Navy Minei, Vice-Minister Yamamoto, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Toyota, and other senior officials have repeatedly gathered until evening. Suddenly, the atmosphere in the entire ministry became tense. The naval leadership held all-night discussions on various plans for guarding the Chinese seas and fleet operations. The situation resembled wartime. (Kyodo News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The tense situation in various ministries, such as the Navy, Foreign Affairs, and Finance Ministries, is self-evident. However, the situation in other ministries with no direct involvement in the incident is also extremely tense. (Kyodo News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Konoe convened approximately seventy representatives from political, financial, and media circles last night to explain the government's policy towards North China. The representatives all agreed to unite and support the government's policy. The Prime Minister detailed the circumstances that compelled the government to make a serious decision, but stated that the government had not abandoned hope for peaceful negotiations. He also stated that the incident was the natural result of many years of painstaking and bold anti-Japanese movements and education in China. The Japanese government's dispatch of troops from Manchuria, Korea, and mainland Japan to China was intended to prompt China to reconsider its attitude. All cabinet members attended the meeting. After the meeting, both the Minseito and Seiyukai parties issued declarations expressing their support for the government's policy. The minority parties also took similar action later. Minister of Finance Kaya announced today that the government is determined to maintain the current exchange rate despite the North China Incident, that is, one shilling and two pence equals one Japanese yen, and asked bankers and financiers to cooperate in achieving this goal. (Central News Agency Reuter Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] This morning, newspapers commented on the dispatch of Japanese troops, all supporting the cabinet's policy. The Asahi Shimbun stated that it would be most fortunate if the situation in North China could be resolved peacefully and that it is not too late to make a final effort to achieve a peaceful resolution as soon as possible. The dispatch of troops is definitely not aimed at a Sino-Japanese war. The Nichi-Nichi Shimbun stated that what they hope for is that this opportunity will be used to adopt fundamental countermeasures against the underlying causes of the Lugouqiao Incident, namely, the anti-Japanese policy of the National Government and the centralization of North China. It also stated that the root cause of such incidents is the anti-Japanese and insulting Japan movements, which must be eradicated. Unless the root cause is eliminated, there is no point in discussing the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. Naturally, some form of guarantee must be obtained and must not be left unfinished. The Hochi Shimbun stated that even if China and Japan can find some way to resolve the situation, it is doubtful whether it can be fully trusted. It hopes that China will promptly adopt a sincere attitude, while the Japanese authorities should exert all their functions to strive for a satisfactory resolution of the situation. However, the strategic opportunity must not be missed. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that if a full-scale conflict unfortunately occurs between China and Japan, the consequences will be difficult to predict. Modern wars cannot be limited to the two countries involved, as the European War is an example. The current situation is more complex and dangerous than during the European War. No one can guarantee that a Sino-Japanese conflict in the Far East will not cause many waves. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>British and French Newspapers Emphasize the North China Crisis</h3>
<p>Officials Maintain Silence; Authoritative Figure Issues Statement</p>
<p>[London] Newspapers continue to emphasize the crisis in North China, but have not yet commented on it. In general, it seems that all parties are unwilling to say or do anything that would increase the severity of the situation. Government officials are maintaining silence, believing that they must obtain more information before they can adequately understand the situation. However, an authoritative figure who recently returned from the Far East stated in an interview with a Reuters reporter today that there are two possible explanations for the incident. First, no foreign troops conduct drills in Chinese territory as frequently as the Japanese troops, so it is not surprising that the Chinese troops would feel resentful. Second, the actions of the Japanese troops are a direct provocation by the Japanese military against the peaceful policies of the new Japanese government. (Central News Agency Reuter Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>[London] In the House of Commons today, members raised several questions with Foreign Secretary Eden regarding the North China incident. In his response, Eden briefly described the course of the fighting in North China, but most of this information was incomplete and had already been disclosed. Eden stated that, according to the Boxer Protocol of 1901, Japan and other powers are allowed to station troops in certain locations in North China to maintain communication with the sea. The total number of Japanese troops currently amounts to approximately 7,000. The current tense situation between China and Japan and its possible repercussions on British interests and international trade are fully recognized. Eden further stated in response to a question from Conservative MP Plugge that if British-Japanese negotiations progress in London, there will certainly be opportunities in the future to discuss the North China incident with Japanese Ambassador Yoshida. The British government hopes that not only the current matter can be resolved, but also the various difficulties between China and Japan can be resolved. (Applause) At this point, Labour MP Henderson immediately suggested that the British government should raise objections with the Japanese ambassador regarding the Japanese troops' drills near Beiping. Eden replied that the origins of such incidents are extremely complex, but he is well aware of the general desire of the House, that is, "we should make every effort to prevent the situation from worsening further." The crowd applauded again. (Central News Agency Reuter Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>[London] Londoners have adopted a calm attitude towards the Far Eastern incident. Due to a lack of buyers, the prices of various goods in the market have been cautiously lowered slightly, but sellers are not eager to sell. Because Shanghai is relatively calm, the prices of Chinese bonds have fallen only slightly. However, Japanese bonds have fallen sharply due to the inability to establish an arbitration ratio with Tokyo due to Japanese currency restrictions. London hopes that China and Japan can reach a settlement soon, fearing that China will re-initiate a boycott of Japanese goods, leading Japan to take retaliatory measures. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>[Paris] French newspapers are paying close attention to the fighting in North China. Le Petit Journal stated that the Japanese cabinet has decided to make a second attempt to dismember China. For the sake of dignity, Nanjing cannot allow North China to negotiate with the Japanese on the issue of sovereignty over the richest provinces of the Republic of China. Le Journal de Paris stated that Japan is currently implementing various plans to seize military hegemony in North China. Le Populaire stated that the Japanese cabinet is uneasy about the growing influence of Nanjing in North China and intends to create this situation. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Lodges Written Protest Yesterday</h3>

<p>[Tokyo] Yang Yuzhu, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Japan, visited Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi Kensuke at 5:00 PM today to lodge a written protest regarding the Lugouqiao Incident. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to diplomatic sources, Xu Shiying has repeatedly requested to resign due to his old age and illness, but Premier Chiang has always persuaded him to stay. It is reported that Xu has recently voluntarily withdrawn his resignation due to the emergency in Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations caused by the Lugouqiao Incident. He will depart for his post in the near future, working diligently despite his illness. Huang Bodu, secretary of the Chinese Embassy in Japan, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 12th and immediately visited various officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<h3>A New Understanding of China That the International Community Should Have</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The mission of Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi's visit to various countries is to promote economic cooperation between European and American countries and China and to foster a new and accurate understanding of China. Reading recent newspaper reports of Kong's speeches and talks in the United States, they are not only sincere and straightforward, without the embellishments of diplomatic language, but also able to explain the most important trends in the progress of the new China to various countries. His broadcast address to millions of Americans on the 7th of this month is enough to correct the general foreign misconception of China. The points he raised are also necessary for our compatriots to fully understand.</p>
<p>First, China's political future is not dictatorship but democracy. In recent years, China has not received the full sympathy of the peoples of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, because they often mistakenly believe that China's future is heading towards fascist-style dictatorship. Even within China, there is still debate about democracy or dictatorship, which is a misconception. Chiang Kai-shek has long expressed opposition to dictatorship, and the National Assembly is about to be convened, and the constitution will be promulgated soon, clearly indicating that China will forever be a democratic country. The opposing camps of democracy and dictatorship in the world are already very stark, and there is no room for hesitation. The Soviet Union, which has long advocated class dictatorship, has also revised its constitution and promoted democracy. When the Soviet Central Committee discussed the election law on the 8th of this month, it recognized the Soviet constitution as the most democratic in the world. Democracy is the highest ideal of mankind and the founding spirit of the Chinese nation. Although it has been slightly thwarted in recent years, it will eventually triumph. Therefore, Kong Xiangxi told the American people, "Democratic politics is the greatest force uniting China's 400 million people and the foundation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People." Kong's explanation has elicited a good response. When he visited Washington, the Washington Post published an article urging its government to actively cooperate with China to consolidate the international democratic front, because China is the guarantee of democratic forces in the Far East and a great force for peace. The American ambassador to Britain spoke on the 7th of this month, vehemently criticizing non-democratic countries and advocating the unity of democratic countries. We should be confident that China will actively strive for international democracy, and the world should recognize that the dictatorial system has no possibility of growth in China.</p>
<p>Second, China's current efforts are self-reliance and resistance to aggression. In other words, China is not a country without resistance, nor is China a dependent nation. Since the September 18th Incident, our country has repeatedly lost territory, mistakenly believing in the League of Nations as reliable. The general international impression has been that the Chinese nation lacks autonomy and self-defense. However, the resistance in Shanghai, the killing of the enemy at Xifengkou, the victory in Suiyuan, the peaceful resolution of the anti-Guangdong and Guangxi issue, and the turning of the Xi'an Incident into a blessing in disguise, and the nationwide unity after the Third Plenary Session, demonstrate the determination to resist aggression, which can prove that the policy of non-resistance no longer exists in China. When the Japanese army recently invaded Lugouqiao, our soldiers vowed to make Lugouqiao their grave and never retreat. This spirit should strengthen our self-confidence and correct the international view. Years of concerted efforts for construction is a reaction to the previous reliance policy. The pro-British, pro-Japanese, Geneva, and Moscow routes have all failed. Only self-seeking unity and construction, and enhancing the strength to resist the enemy is the only way out for our nation. Therefore, Kong Xiangxi told the American people, "The spirit of self-preservation, self-defense, and self-help is the force that unites the Chinese people. The Chinese people generally feel that they must rely on their own strength and resources to seek survival and determine their future destiny."</p>
<p>Third, the Open Door policy is always China's principle for foreign economic relations. In other words, China does not reject economic cooperation with any country. At the same time, the Chinese market cannot allow any country to monopolize or divide it into spheres of influence. In recent years, due to the autonomy of China's tariffs and the government's encouragement of domestic industries, some prejudiced foreigners have deeply resented China's excessive interference in foreign business in China. Japanese newspapers in China have always condemned China's tariffs as being too high, while British newspapers have complained about our government's interference in the export industry. These are arguments that do not take into account China's fundamental interests. China's foreign economic policy maintains the principle of cooperation and mutual benefit and has not changed. As for Japan's desire to monopolize the Chinese market and its recent inducement of Britain to divide China into several spheres of influence, this is certainly intolerable to an autonomous and self-defensive China. The Open Door policy was put forward by the United States and is in line with China's foreign principles. Therefore, Kong Xiangxi called this principle the "crystallization of Sino-US relations, and China is prepared to expand it into a policy of openness and welcome."</p>
<p>In short, establishing a democratic political system, cultivating the strength to resist the enemy, and accepting economic cooperation from various countries are China's basic national policies. Dictatorship, defeatism, non-resistance, dependence, national sales policy, monopoly, and division are not what China needs or wants to accept. Kong Xiangxi's remarks in the United States provide an accurate explanation of these points. The world should view China in this way, and we Chinese people should have such self-confidence and self-encouragement.</p>

<h3>US Warships Equipped with 16-Inch Guns</h3>
<p>Britain Does Not Intend to Follow Suit</p>
<p>[London] After the United States government decided to equip two new battleships with 16-inch guns, the naval affairs reporter for the Thames stated that the British government does not intend to follow the United States' lead and equip new battleships with 16-inch guns. "There are two reasons for this:" First, technical. According to the opinion of certain experts in naval circles, 14-inch guns are the most effective for battleships of 35,000 tons. Second, tactical. According to the naval warfare experience of the British and German navies in the Battle of Jutland during the European War, the largest caliber guns do not necessarily have an advantage.

<h3>Hungary Wishes to Restore Equality in Armaments</h3>
<p>Talks Have Now Stalled</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital. Foreign Minister Kanya recently gave an interview to Mr. Kostic, editor-in-chief of the Yugoslavian newspaper "Time," stating that regarding the issue of armaments, Hungary is willing to conduct friendly talks with the countries concerned, and then seek to restore Hungary's right to equality in armaments. However, these talks have now stalled. As for the details of this issue, we will leave them aside for the moment. However, it must be understood that Hungary has its own views, just as the Little Entente countries each have their own views. Other countries now want to sign a non-aggression pact with Hungary, but this pact does not grant any benefits to Hungary, so how can Hungary be expected to accept it? Conversely, if other countries grant Hungary the equal rights stipulated in the European War peace treaties and the League of Nations Covenant, then I will naturally propose measures of any nature in return. In short, Hungary is an independent country and should pursue an independent policy, just like Yugoslavia. Regarding Hungary's relations with Italy, Austria, and Germany, he said that Hungary's friendship with these countries should be honored. Regarding relations with the Little Entente countries, he said that there are still many difficulties at present, but as long as there is sincerity, it will not be difficult to resolve them and establish practical relations between the two sides. As for the relationship between Hungary and Yugoslavia, the trend is very satisfactory. (Eleventh Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Border Surveillance on French Borders to Cease</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented Starting This Afternoon</p>
<p>[Paris] French officials recently announced that the existing international surveillance measures at the border between France and Spain will cease to be implemented starting at noon tomorrow. French Ambassador to England Corbin formally notified the Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War this morning that the conditions proposed by the Ambassador at the plenary meeting of the Adjustment Committee on the 9th of this month (namely, the surveillance measures at the border between Portugal and Spain should be restored to their original state) can be met, then this decision of the French government can be dispensed with. In short, the French government will continue to fulfill the lies provided by the non-intervention agreement, such as continuing to prohibit foreign volunteers from going to Spain and the use of arms and money to support both sides in the Spanish Civil War. (Twelfth Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>

The content did not involve maritime surveillance work. It is said that the international inspectors originally on the land border between France and Spain will be ordered to retreat to a place farther away from the border at that time. Once the surveillance work on the border between Spain and Portugal is restored, they will be allowed to resume their work. It is also said that France will continue to pursue a non-intervention policy with regard to the Spanish Civil War, and French officials will continue to monitor the border, as they have done before.

<p>[London] The French government's resolution to stop international surveillance on the Franco-Spanish border starting tomorrow has aroused severe criticism in Rome and Berlin. The Italian Fascist political newspaper today recorded Italy's shock at France's threat to abolish surveillance in the Pyrenees, and asked rhetorically, "Is this empty threat or a challenge?" If it is a challenge, then Germany and Italy will not hesitate to accept it. Millions of Fascists are ready to rise up to resist communism, and are ready to cross the Mediterranean to prove their faith. This situation can be realized as long as Prime Minister Mussolini signs. The German People's Observer denounced France's decision as a despicable act intended to coerce Britain. Today, the German newspapers paid great attention to the news that British Foreign Secretary Eden would visit France at the end of the week and meet with the British Ambassador to France. (Twelfth Central News Agency Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Rome] After the French government decided to suspend the implementation of the current international surveillance measures on the border between the country and Spain starting on the 13th, the semi-official Italian Daily and Messenger newspapers severely criticized France's attitude and advised Britain to break away from France. The Italian Daily published an article by famous reporter Gayda, stating, "The resolution adopted by the French government is threatening in nature, has a coercive momentum, and has obviously created a chaotic situation. France's actions have made international cooperation ineffective, and the policy of non-intervention has also been eliminated. British Foreign Secretary Eden has suddenly gone to France, the motive for this is because the actions of friendly countries have made Britain feel difficult, so it is eager to find a way to relieve it." The Messenger newspaper said, "The claim made by France is only intended to deal with its internal affairs. Whether the British government is united with it has never been clear in British public opinion." (Eleventh Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Recent War Situation in Spain</h3>
<p>Madrid. The government army has launched an offensive in the front line area of Madrid City since the 6th of this month. The amount of military equipment used is extremely large, and the air force and artillery are used to assist in the battle. The scale of the offensive is unprecedented since the beginning of the civil war. The intention seems to be to break the Nationalist Army's encirclement line around Madrid, and it has also had a major impact on the front lines in the western part of Aragon Province in the northeast, Estremadura Province, and Andalusia Province in the southwest. It is generally believed that the government army's military operations will continue to develop in order to achieve the important goal of being able to influence the overall war situation. According to reports, the government army departed from the town of Valdemorillo, southeast of Escorial City, on the 6th of this month, and pointed to the city of Navalcarnero. On the same day, it occupied the town of Brunete, and then occupied the town of Navatalacanada on the same night. On July 8, it captured the town of Villafranca. After three days, it can recapture the new town of Boadilla. (Eleventh Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Madrid. After repeated attacks by the government army, which numbered 45,000 in the vicinity of the town of Brunete, west of the capital, they were repelled by the Nationalist Army. The government army had 3,000 soldiers killed in action yesterday alone. The total number of soldiers who have been killed over the last four days is more than 16,000. According to reports, when the government army attacked yesterday, it aimed at the town of Villanueva del Pardillo. Although they charged repeatedly, the Nationalist Army's positions remained unmoved. In addition, the government army also used cavalry to charge at Valdemorillo and Villafranca, but they were also repelled by the Nationalist Army with machine guns. The Nationalist Army's aircraft have shot down 38 government army aircraft from July 10 to this day. The Nationalist Army will also begin a counteroffensive starting today, but it is not known where the counteroffensive will take place. (Twelfth Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>A Certain Renowned Jurist Refutes the Statement by the Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson</h3>
<p>There is Absolutely No Legal Basis for the Japanese Military Exercises at Lugou</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: A certain renowned jurist in this city recently issued the following opinion regarding the statement released on July 10 by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, defending the exercises by the Japanese garrison in North China:</p>
<p>The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson seems to be using Article 9 of the joint note from the powers regarding the Boxer Rebellion on December 22, 1900, and Section 4 of the note from China and the various countries (including Japan) on July 15, 1902, regarding the return of Tianjin, as a basis for defending the Japanese military exercises near the Lugou Bridge. In reality, this spokesperson has probably forgotten that the joint note from the powers demanded the preservation of communication between Beijing and the coast, which was conditional on the occupation of certain locations agreed upon by the various countries. This agreement was then recorded in the so-called Boxer Protocol of September 7, 1901, totaling twelve locations along the Beijing-Fengtian Railway. What must be especially noted is that among these twelve locations, there is neither Fengtai, which has been occupied by the Japanese military since the autumn of the 24th year of the Republic [1935], nor Lugou Bridge, which is located on the Beijing-Hankou Railway line. This Lugou Bridge, located on the Beijing-Hankou line, has absolutely no connection with communication between Beijing and the coast. The Japanese spokesperson seems to have also forgotten that Section 4 of the note on the return of Tianjin states, "Field exercises and rifle practice, except for live ammunition exercises, do not need to be reported to the Chinese side." According to the provisions of this note, it only applies to troops stationed in Tianjin; it does not apply to troops in the other eleven locations outside of Tianjin. Moreover, it certainly does not apply to Lugou Bridge, which is not located on the Beijing-Fengtian Railway line. Furthermore, the so-called field exercises and rifle practice have limitations and cannot be interpreted as the large-scale exercises that Japan has repeatedly conducted in recent years, disregarding China's serious protests. Finally, the jurist believes that Japan's exercises at Lugou Bridge are not only without legal basis but also lack a sense of restraint. Last year, on September 18, they already illegally dispatched troops to Fengtai, forcing Chinese troops to withdraw from the area. Therefore, in the Lugou Bridge area today, they should leave some room and not use exercises as a cover to further embarrass the Chinese troops there. Observing the Japanese military's actions this time, it only makes one believe more that the actions of aggressors have absolutely no limits. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>A Certain Party's New Organization in Xiamen</h3>
<p>A Special Agent-Type Sports Association - Has Credos For Times of Emergency</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Recently, certain nationals of a certain country in Xiamen organized the "□ Overseas Chinese Sports Association." The establishment meeting was held on the 4th of this month in the auditorium of □□ Academy in this city. The membership is close to one hundred people. They are trained in jujutsu (Eastern martial arts), gradually given military training, and used as an armed militia organization, while instilling so-called "patriotism" and "Yamato spirit" and other spiritual thoughts. A translation of the membership rules of the association are as follows: ㊀ Members of this association should maintain the dignity of □□ nationals and cooperate with our officials to promote Sino-□ friendship. ㊁ Members of this association must not engage in any behavior that violates the purpose of this association and damages its reputation. ㊂ Members of this association must fully display the national spirit in times of emergency. ㊃ Members of this association must adhere to the policy of this association and swear to firmly abide by the above matters." This type of organization is no different from a special agent organization. Its intention is to carry out espionage activities, provoke discord in our country's various national salvation movements, and do everything possible to destroy them. Recently, the anti-private movement of the Xiamen public and social military training and voluntary training have been extremely enthusiastic. The vigor of the public sentiment is far from what it used to be. A certain party is deeply afraid of this. Moreover, certain nationals of a certain country are refusing to investigate the provincial government's business tax and have also declared that they are not responsible for paying the central government's income tax, which has become a major problem. Furthermore, certain nationals of a certain country in Xiamen already have a strict Baojia system under the rule of their consulate. Now there is also the organization of a sports association and clearly defined creeds for members to abide by, so it is extremely noteworthy. In addition, the division headquarters of the garrison in Zhangzhou executed three traitors by firing squad on the 8th in Zhangzhou, and the announcement of their crimes stated, "The headquarters has arrested three traitors, Jiang Guiting, Lin Qisheng, and Ou Wen. All confessed to acting as traitors, spying on military information, intending to disrupt public order, and endangering the Republic of China. They also jointly obtained a large number of counterfeit coins from Taiwanese people in Xiamen and used them in the Zhangzhou-Longyan area without hesitation. They were sentenced to death according to law and executed by firing squad with the approval of the Guangdong Pacification Commissioner's Office." In short, the permeation of vagrant people in the city and the arrogance are all serious events at the moment. (July 11)</p>
<h3>Number of Laborers Leaving the Customs in June Decreases Sharply</h3>
<p>Less Than Half of the Number in May - Learned of Mistreatment and Dared Not Go</p>
<p>Dalian Dispatch: The Japanese have repeatedly recruited large numbers of laborers in various parts of Hebei Province to be transported to the Northeast. Later, because the laborers and others learned of the mistreatment of laborers by the Japanese in the Northeast, and even some were unreasonably executed, the lives of the laborers were not guaranteed. Therefore, many laborers no longer dared to go. However, the Japanese side still recruited them on a large scale, using lucrative bait. According to an investigation by the Labor Section of the Dalian Maritime Police Department, the number of laborers going to the Northeast in June of this year decreased sharply, less than half of the number in May.

<p>Sports Field Officially Opened</p>
<p>The public sports field in this county, located at the foot of Yushan Mountain, was opened in the spring of the 8th year of the Republic [1919] and achieved considerable success.

Now, with the approval of the Education Department through the County Education Bureau, it has been allowed to reopen. The field director is still Wang Shoumei. The official opening is scheduled for the 11th. However, due to limited funding, all equipment has been reduced compared to before.</p>

<p>Police Officer Schemes Against a Woman</p>
<p>On the 9th, Sun Ada, a resident of the 12th Bao in Waigang Town, reported to the police station in the town that his wife, Zhang, had turned against him and argued with him with a kitchen knife, requesting that she be punished. Patrol Officer Zhu Caiying approved the request and immediately ordered Zhang to be brought to the station and detained. Zhu had a brother-in-law, Su Wencai, who worked as a police officer at the station. Seeing that Zhang was not yet twenty years old and quite attractive, he had wicked thoughts. At midnight that night, he first released Lu Aquan, a fellow prisoner of Zhang, without authorization. He used both threats and inducements on Zhang, plotting to commit indecent acts. Zhang sternly refused and shouted. Xu Jinlong, another police officer at the station, rushed to the scene upon hearing the sound. Su then fled. The next day, Zhang left the station and reported the information to the Fourth District Office of the town and telegraphed Commissioner Geng of the Jiading County Party Department to come to the town to investigate. She also filed a private prosecution with the county government's judiciary. Patrol Officer Zhu believed that Su's abuse of power and dereliction of duty, harming public morals, was extremely unlawful. He has detained Su and sent him to the county police to be transferred to the county government hall for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Strengthening of Garrison in the City</p>
<p>Recently, with the tense situation in Hebei Province, the police authorities here, in order to maintain local public order, have strengthened garrison from 12:00 AM to dawn, checking pedestrians with suspicious behavior on the main roads in the city.

<p>Increase in Slaughter Tax Quota</p>
<p>The slaughter tax in Wu County has always been contracted by Hua Shilong and collected by the Meat Industry Association. The contracted amount of tax was more than 68,000 yuan per year.

A certain Yan contracted, and the annual tax amount is more than 80,020 yuan, an increase of more than 14,000 yuan. When the meat industry received this news, they decided to give up because the quota was too large to collect on their behalf. The contractor directly collects from each store on a per-head basis.</p>

Liu Runzhen and Liu Yaoxing, together with Manager Wang, withdrew more than 20,000 yuan in cash from the treasury and deposited it in the Bank of Communications as a special fund for partial liquidation. On the 11th, the county government suddenly received a telegram from the board of directors of Xin Fu Bank in Suzhou, stating that a few creditors in Changzhou had actually invited the Chamber of Commerce to organize a liquidation office without authorization and had moved the inventory, which was an act of exceeding authority and violating the law.

This incident may have come to an end. Sincerely, Qin Dechun."</p>

<h3>Chaotic Situation in North China, Shanghai-Peiping Traffic Temporarily Suspended, Tientsin</h3>
<p>Both Railway Bureaus Temporarily Suspend Selling Through Tickets to Peiping　China and Eurasia Aviation Halt Flights to Peiping　Shipping Suffers Losses, Telegrams and Mail Proceed as Usual</p>
<p>Due to the Sino-Japanese conflict at the Lugouqiao Bridge, the situation has become severe. Railway and air traffic between Shanghai and Peiping have been affected and are temporarily terminating at Tientsin. If the situation improves, wired and wireless telegrams and mail will resume as usual, but telegram traffic is heavier than usual. Our reporter investigated the situation at various transportation agencies as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Peiping Air Route Changes Stations</p>
<p>Both China and Eurasia Aviation have regular flights between Shanghai and Peiping. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, to avoid accidents and ensure passenger safety, as the Peiping Nanyuan airfield is located near a military zone, both companies have temporarily changed the Shanghai-Peiping route as follows: ㊀ The China Aviation Shanghai-Peiping route goes from Shanghai via Nanjing, Haizhou, Qingdao, and Tientsin to Peiping. Except for Wednesday and Saturday, when express flights operate both north and south, there is one flight daily between Shanghai and Peiping on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday. Tickets for the Stinson plane flying from Shanghai to Peiping this morning are only being sold to Tientsin for now. It is reported from Tientsin that the East Bureau's airfield at the International Racecourse has been forcibly occupied by Japanese troops. A company spokesperson stated that this information was only seen in the newspapers. ㊁ The Eurasia Aviation Peiping-Hankou and Peiping-Hong Kong routes go from Peiping via Taiyuan and Zhengzhou to Hankou, and then via Changsha and Guangzhou to Hong Kong. Currently, the company is still selling tickets for the Peiping station, but whether to stop at or skip the station will depend on the situation after the flight arrives in Taiyuan.</p>
<p>Both Railways Suspend Through Tickets to Shanghai and Peiping</p>
<p>Due to obstructed traffic in Peiping and Tientsin, the through trains between Shanghai and Peiping of both railways plan to temporarily suspend stopping at Peiping station, using Tientsin station as the terminus. The through train from Shanghai to Peiping that departed the day before yesterday still sold through passenger tickets to Shanghai and Peiping at the request of the navigation passengers, but the train terminated at Tientsin because the situation in Peiping had not yet returned to normal. The through train from Peiping to Shanghai that arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning came from Pukou, with no passengers from Peiping. Therefore, the Shanghai-Peiping northbound train that departed at 12:00 last night stopped selling tickets to Peiping, only selling to Tientsin for the time being. If the situation improves, service will resume to facilitate traffic.</p>
<p>Telegrams and Mail Proceed as Usual</p>
<p>㊀ Since the Lugouqiao Incident, wired and wireless telegrams between Shanghai and Peiping at the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications have remained open. However, due to a sudden increase in telegrams from various parties inquiring about the situation and from Peiping residents reporting the current situation to relatives and friends in Shanghai, telegram traffic is heavier and more congested than usual, with news telegrams being the most numerous. ㊁ The Shanghai Postal Bureau continues to receive all types of mail and parcels, including ordinary, express, and airmail, destined for Peiping. However, as China and Eurasia Aviation have temporarily suspended flights to Peiping station, delivery times will be slightly slower than usual.</p>
<p>Temporary Suspension of Goods, Shipping Suffers Losses</p>
<p>Since this incident occurred, shipping between Shanghai and Tientsin has also been greatly obstructed. Merchants in Tientsin, fearing losses due to the unrest, wired their Shanghai offices to temporarily suspend importing goods. As a result, very few people went to customs yesterday morning to declare exports of piece goods and miscellaneous items to Tientsin. Except for a portion of ships carrying flour, rice, and other food supplies that were cleared, the rest were at a standstill.</p>
<h3>Actions of the Japanese Side in Shanghai After the Lugouqiao Incident</h3>
<p>Meeting of Heads of External, Army, and Navy</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy and Consul-General in Shanghai, convened a meeting at 11:30 yesterday morning at the Japanese consulate on Huangpu Road, inviting the heads of the country's diplomacy, army, and navy in Shanghai to discuss the attitude towards the Sino-Japanese war in the north. Mr. Tajiri, the head of the embassy's intelligence department, Consul Yoshioka, Army Attaché Kita, Naval Attaché Honda, and Commander Okawauchi of the Naval Landing Force all participated, mutually reporting on the war intelligence obtained and exchanging various opinions. The meeting lasted for about an hour, ending around 12 o'clock. It is reported that Okamoto also plans to visit Acting Mayor Yu of this city within days.</p>
<p>Izumo Battleship Garrison Meeting</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Hasegawa, Commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy stationed in China, arrived in Shanghai on the flagship "Izumo" at 6:00 AM the day before yesterday. He held a special garrison meeting on the ship at around 3:50 PM that afternoon. In addition to Hasegawa, those present included Naval Attaché Honda, Officers Okino and Tanaka, Chief of Staff Iwamura of the Third Fleet, Commander Okawauchi of the Naval Special Landing Force, and the Chief of the Garrison Department. The meeting lasted until around 4:15 PM. Army Attaché Kita, Aide Utsunomiya, and Director Kusumoto of the Special Agency also boarded the ship successively and participated in the meeting, which lasted until after 6:00 PM. Yesterday morning, reporters from the China East News Agency learned that Hasegawa took the initiative at the meeting the day before yesterday, based on the emergency instructions issued by the Navy Ministry on the 8th, to discuss the so-called "protection of Japanese residents." It was decided to divide the fleet into three special task forces, each controlling one gunboat, two light cruisers or shallow-draft ships, and one transport ship. In Shanghai, the force is commanded by Hasegawa (Commander of the Third Fleet), in Hankou by Tanimoto (Commander of the First Fleet), and in Qingdao by the Eleventh Fleet. The "Yubari" ship of the Third Fleet is responsible for Xiamen and Shantou (the ship will arrive in Xiamen this morning), undertaking the responsibility of garrisoning and protecting overseas Chinese. When necessary, it can be commanded by the commander of the special fleet, and the Special Naval Landing Force will cooperate in guarding.</p>
<h3>Banking Circles in This City Support Investment in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's Contact Yields Clues　An Inspection Team Will Be Formed to Go to Guangdong First</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, noted that Guangdong Province has fertile soil and abundant products, but unfortunately, due to political instability in the past, construction progress has been slow. The entire industry is waiting to be developed. Since Chen Jitang stepped down, the political situation has stabilized. In the future, the rural economic construction shares and the prospect of developing industry all require assistance from the domestic financial community. This time, Mr. Wu personally came north, and in Shanghai, he discussed investment methods and the development of Qiongyai Island with leaders of the banking community in this city. The banking community unanimously expressed their approval, but everything must start with inspection before making planned investments. According to reporters, banks that agree to invest in the development of industry in Guangdong Province are currently exchanging opinions and will jointly discuss organizing an inspection team to go to Guangdong. However, some leaders of the banking community have left Shanghai to participate in the Lushan Talks, so the specific implementation method can only be decided after these leaders return to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>All Circles Initiate Efforts to Comfort the Military and Civilians</h3>
<p>Christian Churches Donate Funds to Aid Soldiers and Civilians</p>
<p>The Christian United Association of this city sent a letter to the United Charity Relief Association yesterday, stating that the ambitious parties in North China have suddenly provoked our soldiers guarding the territory. Under the scorching sun, they are loyally defending the country, and the local people are suffering greatly. Those who have been wounded and killed in the artillery fire in recent days urgently need relief. Our association, in accordance with the Christian charitable purpose, has first raised 1,000 yuan, hoping that it will be noted and telegraphed to the front lines. Knowing that it is a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem, we ask that you initiate widespread fundraising, and hope that you will quickly send letters to the Red Cross and the Red Swastika Society to rush to the front lines to carry out relief work, to comfort the disaster area and appease the wounded and dead.</p>
<p>Grand Rally to Comfort Soldiers and Officers Tomorrow</p>
<p>The trade associations of department stores, new-style dyeing, knitting, printing, medicine materials, sausage, and antique jewelry in this city, the Cixi, Pudong, Zhuji, and Shangyu Fellow Associations, the Residents' Association's fifth, eighth, twenty-first, twenty-second, twenty-third, thirtieth, thirty-third, thirty-fifth, forty-first, and forty-third District Branch, and more than fifty other groups, represented by Ye Jiaxing, Zhang Wenkui, Gu Wensheng, Zheng Aokui, Zhang Tianbai, Chao Jimei, Feng Meixue, Qian Ying, Xu Yunhui, Zhang Xianfang, Zheng Xiaolin, Ren Nongxuan, Ye Weiyi, Luo Zheng, Shen Longtao, Chen Qifen, Wang Hesong, Fan Tianjin, Fang Peicheng, and others, met yesterday to initiate the establishment of a committee to discuss comforting the soldiers and officers resisting the enemy. It was decided that a grand rally of representatives of various groups to comfort the soldiers and officers resisting the enemy will be held at the Tianhou Palace on the 14th of this month.</p>
<p>Ma Shaoquan Asks to Form a Support Association</p>
<p>Ma Shaoquan, Chairman of the Mineral Ash Trade Association in this city, twice petitioned the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the situation in North China is becoming increasingly tense. The enemy is pressing forward step by step with its strong armor and sharp weapons, and our soldiers are calmly dealing with the situation. It seems unlikely to be completely resolved in a short period of time. Although defending the country is the responsibility of the soldiers at the front, providing financial and material support is also the responsibility of the people in the rear. However, repeated donations are mostly done independently, resulting in a lack of coordination, and unscrupulous people often take advantage of the opportunity in the name of raising funds, leading to criticism in the newspapers and lawsuits in court. The people's trust is lost, and the atmosphere of trickery is becoming more prevalent. Considering that your association organized the collection of comfort goods for the 1.28 Incident and handled matters in an orderly manner, it is appropriate for your association to be responsible for this matter as well. Raise funds and materials for the use of the soldiers at the front, so as to fulfill the people's duty. A special letter is submitted, hoping that you will quickly organize and implement it. We deeply look forward to it.</p>
<p>The Remaining Funds for Comforting the Troops in Suiyuan Are Used to Assist the Soldiers</p>
<p>Last year, bandits and rebels invaded Suiyuan. The women's circles in this city specially organized the Women's Circles Committee for Comforting the Troops and Eradicating Bandits in Suiyuan, raising funds and sending them to the front. There is still a balance of several thousand yuan. The All-China Women's Movement Alliance, considering that the enemy is encroaching on Peiping and that the front lines are in great need of funds, specially sent a letter yesterday to the board of directors of the Women's Circles Committee for Comforting the Troops and Eradicating Bandits in Suiyuan, transferring the remaining funds to be used to comfort all the soldiers of the Twenty-ninth Army.</p>

<h3>Record of Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>More than 300 workers at the Shanghai Beer Factory went on strike. After repeated mediation by the city party headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, a resolution was reached: ㊀ 36 workers, including Zhao Jinyuan, are allowed to be dismissed, and the factory will pay each of them one month's severance pay. All due bonuses and wages will be paid as usual. ㊁ The factory may not dismiss workers without cause in the future, and workers may not strike or slack off without cause. ㊂ The part of the wage increase proposed by the workers will be negotiated directly between labor and management. ㊃ All un-dismissed workers will resume work on July 12. This morning at 7:00 AM, party and government agencies sent organizers to the factory to monitor the workers entering the factory to resume work, and the situation was good. The police temporarily sent detectives to the factory and withdrew after the workers resumed work. The workers who were arrested during the dispute were also released. The labor unrest that had lasted for more than ten days has come to an end. The strike at 14 silk factories, including Fuchang on Xinzha Road, has lasted for ten days. Because of the difference of opinion between labor and management, it has not been resolved. The Social Affairs Bureau convened both parties again yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM for mediation. Finally, the chairman announced three proposals, which the workers found difficult to accept, resulting in failed mediation. The chairman then announced that he would wait for instructions from the director before reviewing them.</p>
<h3>The Zoo Will Transport the Scabby Turtles to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Plan for Adding to the Collection Next Year Has Been Set</p>
<p>The Municipal Zoo has been obtaining four scabby turtles from Xiyuan, Suzhou. Because the objects are large, they have not yet been transported to Shanghai. It is learned that the garden is now preparing nets for capture and will send staff to Suzhou to carry out the capture and bring them to Shanghai for display. The zoo's plan to add to its collection next year has also been drafted and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for review by the city government.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Unified Public Bonds Stopped Being Auctioned</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Lugouqiao War, the market was uneasy, the yarn and flower market gradually declined, and the unified public bonds of categories A, B, C, D, and E for this month and August fell by more than four yuan, so they were immediately stopped being auctioned. The Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange also issued Announcement No. 2492, stating that the unified public bonds of categories A, B, C, D, and E for this month and August have fallen by more than four yuan and should be stopped being auctioned immediately. All brokers should add evidence money and submit it to the exchange before 2:00 PM on the 12th of this month, without delay. Only the decline in the financial long-term 96 public bonds was less significant, at about one yuan and five jiao and one yuan and eight jiao. It was not until 1:00 PM in the afternoon that the auction was completed.</p>
<h3>The Delegation of the Marine Engineers Association Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications Promised to Announce the Measures for Employing Seamen in Mid-Month</p>
<p>The Chinese Marine Engineers United General Association, based on the requirements of the marine engineers of various shipping companies to improve their treatment in line with the national emphasis on technical personnel, sent personnel to investigate the treatment and service conditions of marine engineers of Chinese and foreign shipping companies, and sent representatives to Beijing to request the Ministry of Communications to improve the treatment of marine engineers. The association has been informed that the Ministry of Communications has compiled the opinions of all parties and has separately drafted two drafts of the measures for employing seamen in the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the measures for supervising the employment of seamen by private shipping companies. Although the content includes all levels of seamen such as marine engineers, there are many implications for the treatment of marine engineers. These measures still need to be revised. Some days ago, the association sent Jiang Yanchou, director of the association's affairs, Hu Ningzhi, secretary-general, and Chen Zhenxia and other four people to Beijing to present their revised opinions to the Ministry of Communications. It is learned that the representatives have completed their mission in Beijing and returned to Shanghai last night to report. According to Mr. Hu, the result of this petition was quite satisfactory. Huang Renhao, the chief of the Maritime Affairs Section of the Shipping Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, met with them and accepted the various opinions presented. He also promised to announce the measures for employing seamen in the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company first in mid-month, and the measures for the private sector will also be announced at the end of the month. Therefore, the association is currently notifying its members to wait for the authorities' decision.</p>
<h3>The Qian Dui Industry Begins Inspecting Members' Money Shops from Yesterday, Refusing to Accept Counterfeit Money</h3>
<p>Photographs of Counterfeit Money Will Be Sent to Various Shops for Reference.　The Number of Counterfeit Money That Has Arrived in Shanghai Is Not Large</p>
<p>The 51 member money shops of the Qian Dui Industry Association, after swearing the day before yesterday not to accept counterfeit Manchukuo banknotes and not to buy and sell private goods, hung the declaration printed by the association in a prominent place in each shop from yesterday. At the same time, the association sent photographs of four kinds of counterfeit Manchukuo banknotes, 5 jiao, 1 yuan, 5 yuan, and 10 yuan, to each shop for reference. The inspection committee organized in each district has been dispatched to inspect from yesterday. Those who are found to have violated the oath and accepted counterfeit money will be severely punished. After this counterfeit money is rejected by the money shops, it will inevitably be unusable. It can only be circulated in Japanese shops by Chinese merchants. The number of counterfeit money that has arrived in Shanghai is not large.</p>

<h3>Four Bandits Rob, One Thief Is Caught</h3>
<p>Escaping into a Blind Alley After the Robbery　A Shop Assistant Reported the Arrest on the Spot</p>
<p>At about 9:00 AM on the 10th of this month, four bandits broke into the Huaguang Photo Studio at 352 Baker Road, took out pistols, threatened to make a noise, and robbed 85 yuan in legal currency from the account. They fled in different directions, but a shop assistant, Shen Changshou, secretly followed them and saw one thief escape into Alley 335 on Aivenyi Road. Before long, because the alley was a dead end, he withdrew and reported to Chinese Constable No. 1947, who went and arrested the thief, searched him and found a pistol (with no bullets), and took him to the Xinshan Police Station. Chinese detectives Ma Huirong and Yang Yunfeng learned that the thief's name was Zhou Guilin, from Shaoxing, and ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the previous situation and requested a postponement on the grounds that accomplices were at large. According to Zhu Hai, the owner of the Huaguang Photo Studio, who complained about the robbery situation, the defendant Zhou Guilin confessed that he and the three fugitives went to rob together and that he was holding a pistol. Judge Huang ruled that Zhou would be detained for a seven-day postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>The Appeal Case of Five Russian Thieves Opened for Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Hearing Still Needs to Be Postponed After Questioning</p>
<p>Chinese and Western detectives of the Public Concession Police Department previously uncovered a gang of thieves organized by a Russian, arrested An Tangshishafu, Li Kainashishafu, Li Kaifashishafu, Koshmaibao Luding, Maimikang Katesianshi, Dimishuo Lipaikov, and Dimituo Liduoshifu, and seized five pistols, one hundred and eighty-five bullets, and many machines and iron tools for burning silver boxes with various kinds of firepower. The scale was unprecedented since the gang of thieves was organized. It was found that they planned to rob the Chinese Bank branch in Songjiang. The First Special Court tried the case, and the first and sixth defendants were each sentenced to two years of imprisonment, the fourth and seventh defendants were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, the fifth defendant was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, and the second and third defendants were each sentenced to nine months of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence. After the defendants were sentenced, except for the second and third defendants, who abandoned their appeals, the rest appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The seventh defendant became ill in prison after the appeal and died after medical treatment. Yesterday morning, Judge Yu Hua of the Second Branch of the High Court, together with Judges Peng and Xiao and Prosecutor Lin, opened the first criminal court for trial. After each defendant stated the reasons for the appeal, Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer representing the Public Works Department, said that the original trial judgment was not improper, so the appellants' appeals were obviously without merit and should be dismissed. After questioning by Judge Yu, it was announced that the government would postpone the case for further review.</p>

The foreman, Li Wenji, reported this to the water police station. The injured man was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but he died from his injuries at 7 AM yesterday. Detective Jin Guifu was dispatched to take the body to the Lifesaving Bureau and report it to the hospital for an examination. The body was then handed over to the family for burial.</p>

<h3>The Committee for the Anti-Buying and Selling of Smuggled Goods Sends Letters to Various Associations to Organize Oaths</h3>
<p>After the Oaths, Personnel Will Be Sent to Investigate Whether They Are Being Followed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Committee for the Anti-Buying and Selling of Smuggled Goods sent letters yesterday to various associations, including the Cosmetics Industry, Chinese and Foreign Sundries Industry, and New Medicine Industry, stating: "To eliminate smuggled goods and save the national economy, we are expanding propaganda against buying and selling smuggled goods and planning to organize an oath-taking campaign. The Fourth Plenary Committee has resolved to first organize oath-taking for shops and has passed the following measures: ㊀ The oath-taking of shops will be entrusted by this committee to the relevant trade associations. ㊁ The oath form will consist of three copies, which will be filled out by each shop. The first copy will be posted in the shop, the second copy will be kept by the trade association for reference, and the third copy will be sent to this committee by the trade association for filing. The oath forms will be obtained by each trade association from this committee based on the number of its members, to ensure uniformity. ㊂ Each trade association should complete the oath-taking procedures for its member shops within two weeks of receiving notification from this committee and report to this committee for public disclosure. ㊃ Trade associations may decide whether to notify members in writing or convene a large-scale oath-taking meeting. However, trade associations must notify this committee three days before holding an oath-taking meeting so that personnel can be sent to attend. ㊄ After receiving reports from trade associations on the oath-taking situation of their members, this committee will send personnel to investigate whether the shops have indeed fulfilled the oath procedures and posted the oath forms. Those who have not done so will be persuaded to complete the procedures. Those who still refuse to do so after persuasion will be considered to be undermining the anti-buying and selling of smuggled goods movement and will be recorded. This matter concerns economic salvation, and we hope that your association will agree. Therefore, we are sending this letter and hope for your approval. Please let us know how many oath forms your association requires so that we can deliver them to you."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the committee has printed a large number of oath forms and handed them over to various trade associations and district citizen federations for responsible handling.

<h3>Shanghai People, Hold On a Moment, "Mount Tai"!</h3>
<p>— Liu Qian</p>
<p>There's a Shanghai saying called "Mount Tai," which means "calm" or "composed." It probably comes from the ancient saying, "Even if Mount Tai collapses in front of you, don't change your expression." But this "Mount Tai" attitude isn't unique to Shanghai people; all Chinese people are like that, but it's perhaps more pronounced in Shanghai people.</p>
<p>When the cannons of the January 28th Incident were shaking Zhabei to its foundations, the upper-class Chinese in the foreign concessions remained very "Mount Tai," frequenting brothels and dance halls. That's a recent example. This time, with the alarming news from the Lugou Bridge Incident, our side repeatedly tolerated the situation, and yet people "went back on their word and grew fat," continuing to send troops to surround and attack. If the soldiers of the 29th Army hadn't bravely resisted, what would the situation be now? Although Peiping and Tianjin are still in imminent danger, this resistance has greatly helped to protect the integrity of our territory and fight for the dignity of our nation. However, in this sweltering heat, the soldiers of the 29th Army are fighting bloody battles, and many of us in the rear are still "Mount Tai"-ing away. The reason they're "Mount Tai"-ing away isn't that they deny being Chinese. They also know that Chinese people should love China, but unfortunately, that's all they know. They don't have strong beliefs or passionate emotions, so they just muddle along, hoping to live in temporary peace.</p>
<p>Because of this belief, as long as the sound of cannons is far away in North China and bullets aren't falling in front of their doors, they don't care about anything. Even if a shell falls in front of their door one day, they can still escape through the back door. They'll never think about the day when everything will be destroyed together, and they'll never think about how the citizens of a country are not exempt from disaster when the country is suffering. The facts are already before our eyes. The sound of cannons in Peiping and Tianjin is indeed very far from Shanghai, but Shanghai people won't be lacking this "ear blessing." Yesterday's newspaper reported: "Since the Sino-Japanese military conflict at Lugou Bridge occurred, the Japanese Marines stationed in Shanghai have been holding target practice for days since the 9th, seemingly as a show of force... At around 4 AM yesterday morning, more than 400 Marines marched out of their barracks from the Jiangwan Road headquarters and conducted exercises in the area of Zikawei Road until 6:30 AM before returning to their barracks..."</p>
<p>The purpose of these exercises is certainly not just a show of force. We can easily imagine the implied meaning. It's really hard to say whether Shanghai will suffer another catastrophe like the January 28th Incident. Because once the Lugou Bridge war expands, the threats and disturbances will not be limited to Peiping and Tianjin. The impact will be felt throughout the country, and Shanghai people shouldn't dream of living in temporary peace any longer.</p>
<p>Today, when the country is suffering to such an extent, temporary peace is just a dream, and even fear is futile. For the survival of the entire nation and the integrity of our territory, there is only one path before us: a path to seek life from death. Now is not the time for us – especially Shanghai people – to be "Mount Tai." "Even if Mount Tai collapses in front of you, don't change your expression" – dying that way would be a waste. We should now actively prepare ourselves, regardless of our social class. Although it's not yet time for everyone to go to the front lines, we can't lack this determination. I think we should at least immediately realize that we need to regulate our lives, stop all entertainment and consumption, and use the spirit and money we've saved to comfort the soldiers on the front lines. At the same time, we should organize ourselves and closely monitor the activities of traitors and vagrants because, based on past experience, "disturbing" is their specialty, and using traitors is their consistent policy. We need to go to the people in the countryside and explain to those naive and ignorant people, making them understand the relationship between the people and the country so that they won't be tempted by small amounts of money to betray the country and the nation!</p>
<p>Compatriots across the country, young masters and misses of Shanghai, arise! This is not the time for you to be "Mount Tai"!</p>
<h3>Questions about the Increased Fees for Stallholders on Yuanfang Road</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>The stallholders who make a living by setting up vegetable, fish, and meat stalls on Yuanfang Road have been paying the Public Works Department (工部局) two yuan per month for "many years." Recently, the Public Works Department decided to change this to "nine yuan in national currency per quarter" starting on the first of this month, and it must be "paid in one lump sum." As a result, the Ningbo Fenghua Association in Shanghai, based on a letter from Yu Ruqing and over eighty others, sent a letter to Mr. H. de Quetteville, Deputy Secretary of the Public Works Department. It said: "These fellow villagers are all running small businesses, with capital ranging from six or seven yuan to as little as two or three yuan per stall, earning meager profits to support their families. The increased fees are already unbearable, and paying them in one lump sum is even more difficult... On the 26th of last month, our association forwarded a request to the Public Works Department to consider the actual difficulties faced by these vendors and allow them to maintain the status quo. However, we have not received a reply. Suddenly, the police station in charge sent officers to collect the fees from the vendors, collecting two yuan per month as before. The vendors were overjoyed, believing that the Public Works Department had approved the request. Unexpectedly, the next day, the fee collection office sent officers to collect nine yuan per stall per quarter, stating that the previous notices were illegal, causing public confusion. Later, the two-yuan notices were taken back from each stall, and they were ordered to obtain the nine-yuan per quarter notices. The vendors are confused by the contradictory instructions and find it unbearable to pay according to the new rules. However, the fee collectors are using force to collect the fees..."</p>
<p>The letter does not specify how the "forceful fee collection" is being carried out, and there is no record of it in the newspapers. Presumably, everyone is quite familiar with this kind of "oppressive experience," so there is no need to provide examples. Just close your eyes and imagine, and the events will appear before you. What I want to talk about now is why the Public Works Department suddenly increased the fees. Although the reason has not been explained, everyone (including the stallholders) knows that the Public Works Department's finances have been strained in recent years. They have already abolished the intelligence department to cut expenses, so raising fees is naturally a way to increase revenue. Therefore, this situation is completely different from the stallholder conflict in Pentang Lane last year because the reason for the Pentang Lane incident was "obstructing traffic."</p>
<p>So, if the fees are increased, they are increased. In the report of the chairman of the "Shanghai Cultural Circles' Campaign to Revoke the Right of the Concession to Review Operas and Films," there is a poignant sentence: "When you arrive in the concession, you should forget that you are Chinese!" (This is what the Public Works Department said in response to a certain host.) Since the stallholders on Yuanfang Road have arrived in the concession, they should naturally obey this order, even though they know that "the increased fees are already unbearable, and paying them in one lump sum is even more difficult." However, for the sake of the demolition of shacks, they should grit their teeth and bear this "difficulty" once. Isn't that so? The shacks where they live can be freely demolished, leaving them "homeless on the streets," so increasing fees is just about money. Why should they feel "public confusion"?</p>
<p>However, the question that arises is, after "sending officers to collect the fees from the vendors, collecting two yuan per month as before,"</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>the fee collection office then "sent officers to collect nine yuan per stall per quarter" the next day. This would not only cause "public confusion," but also "public anger," I am afraid? And what is even more suspicious is, "stating that the previous notices were illegal." The "previous notices" were of course issued by the Public Works Department. If the "previous notices were illegal," then this "illegality" lies with the Public Works Department. The stallholders only know that they have paid the money to do business - which is naturally not "illegal."</p>
<p>Now, both the Ningbo and Fenghua associations, considering that this matter concerns the legal rights of their fellow villagers, have instructed the vendors to wait quietly for a resolution. They have also specially sent Chen Zhonggao and Dong Xinqin to accompany the representatives elected by the vendors to present their difficulties to the Public Works Department. It is difficult to predict the outcome. Once we arrive in the concession, we should naturally accept the orders of others. However, regarding the two questions above, we hope that the Public Works Department can provide satisfactory answers to us. This is probably not "illegally" asking, is it?</p>
<h3>Arise! Ye Who Refuse to Be Slaves!</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Hongfei</p>
<h3>Ode to the Lotus</h3>
<p>— Lin Ji</p>
<p>In the quiet countryside, in that pond rippling with green water, lotus flowers are blooming, one after another... It is now the sweltering month of July. I walked along the path between the fields without any specific purpose, and I smelled the fragrance of the lotus flowers. And aren't the frogs croaking and singing pleasant music? I sat for a moment on the heat-baked soil by the pond... I gazed at the most vibrant one... I borrowed a bamboo pole from a passing farmer, plucked that lotus flower down, and went home rejoicing.</p>
<p>"Where did you get the lotus flower?"</p>
<p>"I brought it from the countryside."</p>
<p>"How beautiful! Where will you put it?"</p>
<p>"In my vase; on my desk."</p>
<p>On my desk were two piles of magazines, a long string of novels, and a green desk lamp. I put the vase on the right side, opposite the lamp, where it was accompanied by an eight-inch photograph of Deanna Durbin (note) hanging on the wall. At night, moonlight peeked in through the window, so I simply turned off the lamp and let the flower bathe in the soft moonlight, looking as charming as a sacred virgin. In the July night, the wind was so gentle that it couldn't even stir the thin curtains. There wasn't a sound around; the world seemed to have fallen into a secluded valley. …I gazed at the lotus flower; one minute, two minutes, I kept gazing at the lotus flower... In front of the lotus flower, I returned to the world of old and found someone who also loved lotus flowers...</p>
<p>This person was the same age as me, and we were both studying at the same middle school. In our middle school campus, there was a round pond. Every summer, countless lotus flowers bloomed on that pond, and the pond was covered with green lotus leaves. There was a wooden sign erected by the pond that forbade picking the flowers, which made us feel very disappointed.</p>
<p>I said, "I wish we had the right to have a lotus flower!"</p>
<p>He said, "How wonderful it would be to put it in our dormitory!"</p>
<p>I said, "Let's do it at night."</p>
<p>He said, "We'll get a major demerit..."</p>
<p>But that day, I went to buy a cheap vase and filled it with water. At night, I went with him to secretly pick a lotus flower. Then, we quietly sneaked back to the dormitory and put the flower in the vase. That night, there was moonlight too. We both stared at the lotus flower as if possessed until after midnight before we went to sleep.</p>
<p>The next day, he was reported to the dormitory supervisor and received a major demerit, but I didn't. I went to the supervisor and said, "I was the one who came up with the idea..." But the supervisor unexpectedly replied, "Don't lie. Everyone knows he's a bad seed, a troublemaker!" The only thing left to do was apologize to him. He said, "What's the point? It's better for me to get the demerit than for both of us..."</p>
<p>Three years ago, it was also lotus flower season. I returned to my hometown from Shanghai, and the first thing I did was pick a lotus flower to see my old companion. When I arrived at his house, his white-haired old mother came out to greet me. As soon as she saw me, she became sad and cried, lamenting that her young son was dead! …What was going on? Although I hadn't been in contact with him for half a year, why had the world changed so quickly? …"They said my son was restless and colluded with bandits, so they took him away from school without explanation!" This reminded me of a riot in my hometown half a year ago, and I hadn't heard from him since...</p>
<p>I took the lotus flower to his grave in the overgrown weeds. Silently, I offered my sacrifice. I looked at the sky - the sky was so high.</p>
<p>…And now it's lotus flower season again… In front of this lotus flower, I thought of my dead companion and my hometown in the storm, and I laid my head on the desk.</p>
<p>(Note) Deanna Durbin is a movie star.</p>
