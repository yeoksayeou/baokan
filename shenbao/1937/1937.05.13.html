<h3>縣長任用法原則</h3>
<p>［南京］縣長任用法原則、業經十二日中央政治委員會修正通過共計五項玆探誌其原文如下、</p>
<p>㊀凡年在三十歲以上、依法應縣長考試及格者、應儘先任用外、其具有法定資格之一、經各省民政廳詳細考核就其才具操行學識經驗體格計加考核認為堪任縣長者、由各省政府主席報送內政部、核轉銓敘部審查合格後、以候用縣長有記、考核辦法由考試院定之、具有法定各欵資格之一者、行政院認為必要時、得指定所屬各機關保送、由內政部詳加考核送銓敘部審查合絡後、以候用縣長存記、（說明查現行縣長任用資格須根據三種法規、一•“縣長任用法”、二•“公務員任用法、”三•“剿匪區內縣長任用限制暫行辦法”三法並行參差不齊、似非統一銓敘之道推究縣長作用法、不能統一之原因、厥在原法資格限制過度、各省縣長資格頗難齊一、致縣長任用法未能推行盡利、血各種補救辦法迭出茲為統一法規顧全事實起見、將前三種法規規定之資格、其高下不同者酌量歸納於一法之內、復略加行政經騐成績、及研究等條件、以期收羅名實相符之人才、又因各省各區設署之區長、事繁責重旣非庸碌者所克勝任、而位卑酬薄、亦不易羅致人才、為鼓勵賢能服務下層工作、以冀增進區政效率起見復規定此種區長得升任縣長使為民盡摔之區長、得有升遷之途、又各省政府民政廳長、對於物色縣長人才、負有專責、茲以考核為公開求才之具、保送為負責舉賢之方、庶不致輕易舉薦、俾縣長人選蔭以提高、至考核辦法規定由考試院定之、在製定劃一辦法、俾各省有所依據以歸律而免紛歧、又行政院總攬全國行政事宜、因國策之運用需用特種人才、對於縣長人選認為有須由所屬機關保送者、得指定辦理、所以廣登庸而應事機、</p>
<p>㊀各省如有已足法定年齡、才德兼優、富有行政上之學識經驗者、得由各該省政府主席向內政部特予保送、並經考試院考詢及格後、交銓敘部以候用縣長存記、（說明查資格之規定所以防浮濫、而資格限制亦有時易阻特殊賢良進身之路、現在各省縣長經各省政附任用克稱厥職者、或因資格不符難于合格而傑出之士、又或因格於資俗、即難任用、揆之國家用人本旨、但有未符、即法令推行亦難有效、故本草案有特保之規定、以期各省縣政進行得以順利、真才不致湮沒、而省政府特列名額、須經兩部核定保送之後、須經考試院考詢、亦致發生浮濫、</p>
<p>㊀凡依本法取得縣長資格人員、均須先經內政部統一訓練後、分發任用、（說明、查縣長負國家法令實際推行之責須充分了解中央政令之精神、與中央行政領袖之意旨、乃能切實奉行以齊一民衆之耳目、而收全國整齊團結之實效、本草案規定候用縣長、須由內政部統一訓練使縣長不徒在形式上為中央之官吏、實質上亦受中央之陶鎔、一旦受仟地方自能秉承中央政令忠於職守內政部主管全國民政訓練自應由其主辦、以一事權、</p>
<p>㊀凡經分發候用之縣長、如無曾任行政職務一年以上之資歷者、須在分發省份、先以縣政府秘書科長局長或區長等職實習一年、期滿經省府考核成績優良者、始得日用、前項實習候用之縣長、如因特殊情形不及實習或實習不滿期、省政儲記為可予减免咨請內政部核定、轉咨銓敘部備案者、得减免其實習期間（說明）縣長旣為親民之官且負政令實施之責則行政經驗不可或缺、雖具備資格、曾受訓練、然驟任繁劇、恐不免臨事周章、或舉措疏漏人民情偽或有未悉、屬吏臧否、亦將不辨、免咎已難、遑部圖功、故本草案規定以先任縣長秘書科長局長或區長等職、以資實習、因此等職務、旣切於縣政、復在縣長指導監督之下、亦不致以並無經騐輕舉僨事、果能對于以上職務歷練而有成續則受任縣長必能較有把握、此乃于任用程序之中、寓培植人才之意、又各省政府每因縣長補缺須人、或經嚴密考察、認其候用縣長無須實習者、如有充分理由、亦可减免實習期間、所以重省府之權責、其須咨請內政部核定轉咨銓敘部備案者、所以杜取害而重考績、</p>
<p>㊀中央各機關現職人員具有本法規定之候用縣長咨格者、得與各省依法任用之現任縣長、相互調用、（說明）年來中央與地方行政、每感缺乏聯絲、殊足影響一貫之行政方針為溝通政情、免除隔閡起見、故本草案規定中央與地方從政人員、相互調用之原則、以收入才調劑內外相維之效、再二十三年全國考銓會議决議案中、關於京選縣市長原則案、業經大會决議通過並由銓敘部依據原則擬草案送請中央核定發交立法院審議在案、故乘縣長任用法規修正之際、將該項提案之精神予以參入、（十二日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>杜絕走私問題</h3>
<p>— 禹</p>
<p>中國海關總稅務司梅樂和日昨在倫敦就走私問題發表談話。略謂“天津海關的緝私工作近雖稍見進步。但冀東門戶還未防守嚴密。就有效的緝私計劃而言。天津海關地位。依然不曾改善。非至中國在不駐兵區域的主權切實恢復。及海關緝私隊可以行使其尋常的職務時。海關地位恐終不能改善。換句話說。必須於海上巡私船和岸上緝私隊恢復武裝以後。海關緝私的職務。纔能照常執行”</p>
<p>在這走私猖獗的時候。負關務重責的梅樂和。能够率直的提出杜絕私貨的根本辦法来。不能不說是很有意義。梅樂和是英國人。英日兩國外交人員這幾天又正在大談中國問題我們希望那些附和日本方面减低中國關稅主張的英國紳士們多把這位在華服務多年的本國人的話想一想。不剷除走私的根苗。私貨就永遠沒有杜絕的一天。而走私的禍害决不是減低關稅所可防止的。</p>
<p>梅樂和的談話里。最明白的幾句就是。“必須海上巡私船和岸上緝私隊恢復武裝以後。海關緝私的職務。繼能照常執行。”江海關緝私人員接連發表過的兩次宣言。正好在這里作一個補充。他們願意奮鬥。他們願意犧牲。然而他們沒有武裝。赤手空拳終究敵不過鐵尺木棒短挺。甚至實彈的手槍。</p>
<p>那麼怎樣恢復緝私人員的武裝呢。照梅樂和所說。“非至中國在不駐兵區域的主權切實恢復。緝私隊可以行使其尋常的職務時。海關地位終恐不能改善。”我們可以澈底明白。要關員恢復武裝實施緝私的權力。非收回被侵奪的領土和主權不可。舉例來說。要杜絕上海走私。必須恢復上海碼頭上的中國主權。要杜絕華北走私。必須首先收復走私大本營的冀東。進而收復走私後營的東北。</p>
<p>關於取消冀東偽組織問題。最近有過進行談判的傳說。當然。這種傳說還不外乎烟幕作用。如果因談判的结果。冀东把現存的偽祖織取消。而實際上仍舊脫不了特殊區域。則冀東一定還是走私浪人的樂園。我們决不能容忍、這樣的狀態。我們所要求的。是主權切實的恢復。領土切實的收回。這樣。走私以及中日間一切問題纔可以獲得澈底的解决。</p>
<p>自然。我們並不是主張除力爭這些根本要點之外。可以放棄其他各種工作不做。在沒有眞正收復領土主權以前。“拒私”工作。也有切實履行的必要。現在平津學生已經發起了“拒私同盟。”希望全國人民都起來響應。阻絕私貨的出路。</p>

<h3>宫中準備</h3>
<p>是時氣象台發出報告云、晨間大致晴和、雖偶有雲雨、僅以一隅為限、白金漢宮執事人員、自拂曉時卽已準備就緒、御廐內所蓄各馬亦已加上鞍轡、而由御廐大臣鮑福爾公爵巡視一過、國于喬治六世與后伊麗莎白已在宮中用罷早膳、但因宮前歌聲澈夜未停、夜來似未能安睡、膳畢、卽入內更換朝衣、是時參加儀仗各色人等、紛紛乘車到達宮內廣廷、絡繹不絕、群衆頻頻向之歡呼不絕、其中計有印度長槍隊、倫敦騎警隊•紅色制服軀幹魁梧之御林軍•盔甲鮮明之騎兵•王家騙衛隊•澳洲聯邦與紐西蘭自洽領軍隊•加拿大騎警隊與童子軍、至倫敦市長白洛特勃里奇爵士已乘本市古式馬車前往威司敏斯特大敎堂、</p>

<h3>加冕詳情</h3>
<p>［倫敦］今日威司敏斯特敎堂中琉璃窗上、金碧輝煌、燭臺高燃、銀光燦爛、金紫之光互相掩映、蔚為奇觀、正中神壇作純金式、上直金盤旁有甌罇等名器若干事、神壇之前則鋪黃金地衣、緣以紫邊、此卽舉行加冕之塲所、更前則有五級小臺、上置英王寶座、其左則為后座、較低二級、寶座之前則復有愛德華王賓座、自愛德華以後、歷代英國君主均坐於其上、受膏沐而加冕者也、今日衣香鬢影諸貴歸之中、有蒼顏白髮老媼十六人、代表歐戰中死於王事諸英烈之母、故均佩其子之動章於胸前焉、</p>
<p>貴賓入座</p>
<p>今日威司敏撕特敎堂中、王族之最早蒞監者為后之父母斯特拉斯摩伯爵及伯爵夫人、自八時四十五分、八千賓客均已入府、十五分釧後、第一批儀仗隊已徐行而抵堂之中央、此為各國王室要人及各國代表團人物、</p>
<p>王族就席</p>
<p>至十時、由主敎敎士等自神壇取御用寶物而下、徐行經常之中央而入旁室、鈄聖愛德華王冕王芴寶劍神球等置一桌上、以待貴官捧之而加入王室之遊行、此時歌詩班已由敎士導入、高唱聖詩、互相酬答、肅穆動人、至十時十五分、王族徐步而入、會衆悉起立祇迎、伊麗莎白公主、及瑪格麗露絲公主、由其姑扶入、二小公主曳金紫長衣夾長公主前行、步代齊整、惟露絲年幼、趨隨似較費力、次格羅塞斯特公爵夫人及坎特公爵夫人等曳長衣入、就神壇右王族席云、十時三十五分挪威女王駕臨、由侍衛簇擁而入、次母后入佩賓章及光輝四射之鑽飾、其長衣由着紅衣之童子四人捧之而行、挪威女王及母后徐步入王族席、由格羅塞斯特公爵夫人恭迓入座、母后就座後、王族席之前排已告齊、距神壇最近者、為斯特拉斯摩伯爵•次則伯爵夫人•坎特公爵夫人•格羅塞斯特公爵夫人•挪威女王•母后曼麗•及二小公主、</p>
<p>主角駕臨</p>
<p>繼喇叭號齊鳴、聖詩班高唱“余乃欣然”之詩、衆知英王及后已駕至、方在旁室中更衣也、此時敎堂中金光燦爛、堂中賓客羣相延頸而望、貴官之佩動章及執帝國各地之徽幟者徐行而入、次則有武士四人前導、首相包爾溫率各自治領首相等入、</p>
<p>英王及后入敎堂時、前有導者若干人手捧御用品而行、后隨於後、王更隨於后後、后入時容顏灰白而嚴肅、徐向歌詩臺前進、王入時首戴御冠、目直視前行、兩旁觀者均鞠躬致敬、</p>
<p>行承認禮</p>
<p>王與后跽而作私禱畢、乃各就坐於“承認椅”上、接行承認禮、於是坎特白里大主敎與法相大禮官、警務總廳長鳥沙爾伯爵同行、先至臺東次臺南、臺西臺北、每至一面、大主敎朗聲聞衆曰、“論群余今以諸君所無疑之喬治王介紹於諸君本日來此者、皆為效忠盡役而來、論君亦願為此否、衆乃大呼“上帝其佑喬治王”、於是喇叭齊鳴、乃宣誓焉、大主敎對王發問曰、（爾願莊嚴作約、並宣誓依守各地之法律與習慣、統治大不列顛、愛爾蘭、加拿大、澳大利亞、紐西蘭、南非聯邦、以及一切所有地領土、與爾印度帝國之人民乎、”王以低而清晰之聲毫不猶豫而作答曰、“朕莊嚴作約照行”、大主敎復問曰、”爾對於一切裁决、願盡爾權力、使法律公道得在慈愛之中履行乎”王曰“願”、大主敎繼又發數問、王一一以低聲作答畢、乃赴神壇、</p>
<p>宣誓吻經</p>
<p>冕冠下跽、置右手於聖經、宣誓曰、“朕適在此所允諾之一切、願遵行之保持之、求上帝佑朕”、於是吻經答名於誓詞、於是接行聖餐禮之第一節樂班誦信條、人、人面神壇、加冕禮乃入於宗敎儀式、</p>
<p>行膏沐禮</p>
<p>未幾行膏沐禮、當時景狀、堪稱偉觀諸主敎皆恭立王與王后之左、諸國務大員咸衣大紅白貂禮袍、恭立其右、王后衣尾甚長、紫金二色相間、胸衣滿飾鑽石、燦爛奪目、免冠露髮髮黑王於樂班唱聖詩聲中、由大禮官為其卸紅袍、於是王乃步至神壇前之聖愛德華寶座就陸、由高貴爵士四人、張一華蓋、覆王之首大主敎乃以聖油塗王兩手及首與前胸王免冠靜立白衫白褲白襪、儼如靑年、觀者心房、咸為感動、王行各種禮節時、其后在側凝神注視、沐膏禮成、王加金布之外衣、獻跟馬刺與寶劍、次乃加御袍、獻神球御笏、其景狀使見者永不能忘</p>
<p>臣下效忠</p>
<p>下午十一時三十分、羣衆咸起立、堂內沙沙作聲、威司敏斯特主敎向神壇取王冕恭授與坎特白里大主敎、大主敎乃高舉加諸王首、羣衆高呼“上帝其佑吾主、”堂外之入、亦高呼以應之、時為十二時三十分、王加冕畢、堂內沙沙之聲復作、蓋各貴族咸以其貴冠加首、瞬息而畢、於是乃行莊嚴之效忠禮、</p>
<p>祝福旣畢、王升寶衛、其待衛與大員左右隨衡、首由年長之大主敎跽誧效忠詞、且吻王左頰、當時王衣寬袍、戴御冕、端坐寶座、各貴族趨前致效忠詞時、其貴冠咸由白衣白褲之捧衣童子代持、</p>
<p>王后加冕</p>
<p>效忠禮成王后由五人捧其美麗之衣尾、登神壇、而加冕步過王前時、行一鞠躬禮、其禮節較王之加冕為簡、歷時亦短、次各公主與貴族夫人各加其貴冠於首、最先在御廂行此禮者、為伊麗莎白公主、露絲公主加冠時、頗不易使之安置首上、禮成、王后步就其寶座、座設王左、當過王前時向鞠躬、</p>
<p>全部禮成</p>
<p>於是加冕禮入最後一幕、於聖詩誦聲朗朗中、以聖餐禮結束之、於是王與后等、乃於風琴高奏國歌聲中回至西門而出敎堂、其時景狀甚至較入堂時尤覺、燦爛悅目、</p>
<p>御輦還宮</p>
<p>下午二時將至堂內禮節告畢、堂外軍隊已豫作返宮準備、開始山發、儀仗之長約二哩有半、第一馬車載首相包爾溫與其夫人者、至二時十六分始離敎堂、母后之玻璃車緊隋其後、二小公主與其祖母同乘、是時敎堂之中、鐘聲鏗鳴敎堂內外羣衆歡呼之聲、直上雲霄、王與王后於二時四十分同升御車、</p>
<p>天不做美</p>
<p>王與王后甫離敎堂、兩師驟降、但沿涂民衆之熱忱未為稍殺、御車過時歡聲雷動、倫敦學童三禹七千人、曾集於泰𥆐上河濱、以觀熱鬧、沿途萬頭攢動大都皆着雨衣且有擲帽於空以表示其興奪者、</p>
<p>外國顯貴、處白金漢宮者、皆立宮前窗次、以觀王與王后之歸、四時零四分、御車於大雨滂沛中入宮之南門、隨衛軍隊、冒雨步行、故皆遍體如淋、濕侵及膚、是時宮中衛隊高奏國樂、</p>
<p>感謝民衆</p>
<p>王與王后抵宮後宮外民衆、良久未散、高唱國歌大呼“我等欲一見王”、伊麗莎白公主曾在窗前小立、四時四十分、王與王后步至宮前陽臺、屨向羣衆鞠躬、表示感謝、二小公主戴小金冠亦接踵而至、繼母后曼麗與坎特公爵亦至、羣衆皆脫帽立大雨中、復高唱國歌而散、（中央社十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>朝賀人員一律白緞短褌</h3>
<p>人民陣錢各國代表　特許穿着燕尾禮服</p>
<p>［伦敦］按之宫廷禮儀、每值大典、朝賀人員均須穿白緞短褌、白色長襪、此例沿行已歷數百年之久、此次國王加冕大典、則因法外長台爾博斯•蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫•西班牙共和政府特使裴斯德羅•均經特許穿着尋常燕尾禮服、而母须短褌長襪、以故人民陣綫各國在服裝上、亦將表示與衆不同、惟美國外交官一向主張服裝民主化者、此次則反遵守英國宮廷儀式而穿着短褌、又西班牙共和政府駐英大使阿斯加拉德亦將着短褌白襪、则以此為各國駐英使節之慣例、不欲輕加變更故也、（中央祉十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英王所享十項大權</h3>
<p>特實際上决不會行使的</p>
<p>新王喬治六世已加冕了、許多人要問、新王所享的權力、可比英國歷史上的任何君主少些麼、有些人却亳不猶豫地說、內閣—不是下院—現在掌握着英國的最高權力、這些人却忘記了國王仍舊握有很大的權力、倘若他要行使的話、</p>
<p>英王能够不跟國會商量、實行下載的十件事、</p>
<p>㊀他有權遣散陸軍、㊁他能褫免從總司令以下各軍官的官職、㊂他能褫免海軍中各將士的官職、㊃他能出售一切軍艦跟海軍軍需品、㊄遇到英軍戰敗時、他能犧牲他所有的康華爾公領、跟敵國議和、㊅他能為英國征服他国起见而開戰、㊆他能封大不列颠任何男女性公民為貴族、㊇他能使大不列顛任何敎區成一大學、㊈他能褫免大多數文員的官職㊉他能恩赦一切罪犯、</p>
<p>這些權力、可算得範圍十分廣大、英國若從事戰爭、這些權力很能打銷全國的一切努力、雖然從未有人想到喬治王或將行使這些權力、但是按照憲法、他是的確享有的、</p>
<p>凡負責大臣提呈英王的任何文書英王都將簽准、這自然是人所知道的、甚至有人說、倘若兩院同意把英王本人的判死書送給他、他也總得簽准、</p>
<p>從前維多利亞女王曾簽定許許多多文書、可是伊時常免不了提出抗議、西德萊李爵士曾說道、“伊有多次寫信給一位閣員說、伊雖然從沒有贊同這個或那個建議、可是仍然常常聽他在需要的當兒、謂伊作批准的正式簽字、</p>
<p>喬治王六世仍有權拒絕贊同國會所通過的議案、但是自從安想女王登位以後、國王便未曾行使這權、</p>
<p>有些人相信國王在位的時候、未得國會的同意、是不會離開英國的、但是喬治一世的初年、便把法令中的這條取銷以便出國去遊哈諾佛愛德華七世屨次行使他的出國權、喬治五世到印度去加帝冕、又創了一個新例、</p>
<p>喬治王六世倘若願意的話、能够免除或减輕罪犯的刑法、把死刑的名表呈送给国王的习惯、在靑年維多利亞女王登極時、便廢止了、國會通過一種法令由內務大臣操赦减刑罰的特權、雖然內務大臣現在仍負這個責任、却是用國王的名義行使的、有一句古話說、“君王是無過的”、這話已成了實在的法律、譬如英王假造一張支票、是不能傳他到法庭審問的、倘若他破壞任何人民的名譽是不能控告他犯譭謗之罪的、狄西敎授所著的“憲法的法律”一書、曾说及倘若英王親手槍斃他的首相、却沒有法庭能够劉他起诉、英王雖然不能被人在他自己的法庭控訴、可是他能控訴他人的過失、</p>
<p>英王的汽車沒有號數、車行的速度不受限制、英王的電報、須儘先免費拍發、他的函件不貼郵票、都得免費寄遞、</p>
<p>喬治王如願意、他可以坐馬車直到海德公園的羅丹羅街、英王能購置房屋或地產、但是根據法律、不能租用、因為國王不能做人的租戶、或受人民的拘束、</p>
<p>英王不納所得稅、他所有的產業、都從君主的權利得來的、維多利亞女王跟愛德華王七世都曾照納所得稅、維多利亞女王因為那時的人民把所得稅視為一種苛稅、所以伊首先繳納、以為人民的表率、直到喬治王五世登極、國王才免納這稅、</p>
<p>英王的宮院都不付市捐、他也不付死稅、但是他的私產、也得跟人民照樣繳納捐稅、</p>
<p>王室所用伺候喬治王的官員跟僕役、都不能由警察逮捕、他們也沒有充陪審員的義務、</p>
<p>英王有一種權利、是永遠享不到的、那便是選舉權、甚至桑特林漢英王田產最低微的工役、都享有投票權、而桑特林漢敎區國會選畢人登記冊中、却找不到英王的名字、人都盼望英王在政治中保守嚴格的中立、</p>
<p>喬治王到劇塲的時候、卽使坐在御廂中、也得給錢、他觀劇是以私人資格前往的、除去通觀慶祝日的演劇或慈善展覽會、報紙都不能宣佈他預定的出遊、再者、他以私人資格前往觀劇、在進劇塲的當兒、不得奏國樂張揚、惹起人的注意、</p>
<p>上面所說的一切、都是新王喬治六世登極後所享的權力、種類多而且大、許多人或不免見而驚詫、甚至國王自己、也要驚詫、本文前段所開英王所享的諸項權力、那是一位精明的思想家銀行家著作家裴治賀特氏、於維多利亞女王在位時所草定的、有人把他所寫的文章送給女王閱看、女王便大呼道、“嚇上這惡徒却寫出這麼一回事、我的人民是不會相信的”、伊雖然懷疑、但是英國的大法律家都不得不承認國王享有這些權力、到了今日、喬治王在位、還是不能爭辨的、不過新王决不會行使這些權力那是一件確實可信的事情、</p>

<h3>京市地價稅减折征收之經过</h3>
<p>經依法令縝密考慮　最低稅率體恤民艱</p>
<p>南京通信、市府於昨日上午八時舉行總理紀念週到全體職員、由秘書長王漱芳主席、領導行禮後卽席報告地價稅減折征收之經過、略謂依照土地法之規定、所訂稅率初由本府依法擬定、呈由行政院發交內政部審查修正、並由行政院送請中央政治委員會、發交土地專門委員會詳加研究、始行决定、故本市地價稅稅率、可謂最合法最公允之稅率、至於地價之估定、亦係經地政局及土地估價委員會根據買賣時價登記報價及土地法各項規定、縝密考慮取得平均價格、手續合法、估價公允、此次本府之所以减折征收、非因過去所訂之稅率及所估之地價或有瑕疵、實有鑒於一般人民對於政府新稅、往往不問是否合理輒抱觀望態度、吾人為求新稅推行順利、鼓勵人民踴躍繳納起見、參照財政上優待依限繳稅之慣例、故决定於地價稅開征之初期、限以三年、予以九折實收之優待、其次、南京自奠都以來、因政治之改良、公共事業之開發、地價飛漲、但自國難發生以來、同時受世界不景氣之影響市面未能十分繁榮、例如太平路為本市最繁榮之街道、但商店倒閉、時有所聞、同時地主建築房屋後不易和出、或雖有土地、無資建築、故為减除人民實際困難起見、决定將地價稅暫時按照九折實收、至於吾人之所以决定减為九折、不减為八折或八五折者、係於體恤人民之中、仍寓遵守中央法令之意、蓋土地法規定建築用地稅率最低限度、應按地價千分之十征稅、本市建築用地稅率、原定為千分之十四、如按九折實收、僅為千分之十二強、自住地依法再予以八折之權利、則實征數僅為千分之十強、與土地法規定之最低限度、僅相差十萬分之八、如减為八折或八五折、則將低於土地法之規定限度、於法不合、茲將本市各類地稅照九折實收後之數目計算如下、</p>
<p>㊀建築用地、按千元地價征收千分之十四、以九折繳納、應繳地價稅十二元六角、對於自住部份再按八折征收、應繳上元○○八分、實際祇照稅額七二折征牧、其稅率僅及千分之十強、㊁農作用地、按千元地價征收千分之十、以九折繳納、應繳地價稅九元、對於自耕部份、再按八折征收、應繳七元二角、此稅率僅及千分之七强、㊂未改良地、按千元地價征收千分之一十五以九折繳納、應繳地價稅二十二元五角、其稅率僅及千分之二十二强、㊃荒地、按千元地價征收千分之四十、以九折繳納應繳地價稅三十六元、其稅率為千分之三十六、</p>
<p>此外本市有一特殊情形、卽限制使用地及路綫經過地、自不能照普通土地征稅、以昭公允、故前此市政會議特提出討論、議定减免辦法如下、㊀限制使用地、有建築物存在仍照舊使用者、照農地稅率按千元地價征收千分之十、以九折繳納應繳地價稅九元、其稅率僅及千分之九、其因限制使用不能建築暫作農地使用者在未免除限制以前折半征收、卽每千元應繳五元再打九折僅收四元五角其稅率僅及十分之四•五、其完全不能使用者、在未恢復原狀以前、免征地價稅、㊁路綫經過地、（甲）路綫經過部份、人民業已縮讓地為路用者免征、（乙）空地內有路綫經過、依章不准建築之土地、因不能使用形等廢墟者免征、（丙）路綫經過地已有建筑物者、則在未收用以前、已屬地盡其用、卽使將來必被征收但有地價及拆遷費之補償、亦無若何之損失者、其地價稅、仍照征收、</p>
<p>綜上所述、本府此次减折征收地價税、於人情法理均無不迨但有少数人民仍得寸進尺、希望再予减輕、日前市長召集地方土紳茶會解釋此次地價稅减拆征收經過、有一部份人、竟提出要求冉予减低、並將此項减折征收辦法、延長至五年、為不違背法令、祗得礙難照辦蓋本市為首都所在、建設繁重如人民對於應納之稅捐、過於苛求减輕、勢必影響首都建設之進行、日本府此次减折之成數、已至减無可减之程度、甚望市民深體此旨、踴躍繳納、以免增加政府辦事之困難、且日前中央政治委員會、已將土地法中地價稅滯納罰則加以修正、按土地法原定罰則過輕政府雖可於人民欠稅不繳至法定年限、將其產業拍買、但除扣除其應繳之稅欵外、僅課以年息五釐之罰金、如此、一般狡滑之人民、可以欠稅至四年、將應繳之稅欵存入銀行、享受年良八釐至一分之利益、將來以之抵繳稅欵、尚有年息三釐至五釐之餘利、或因現欵缺乏、向銀行借欵、須負擔年息一分以上之利息、如將應繳之稅欵不繳留為己用、無異向政府借欵、僅負年息五釐之利息、中央政治委員會、鑒於此種弊端、特將此項欠稅利息改為年息一分、如此、一般狡滑之業戶、將無利可圖故甚望全體市民、能切實認識本府引次减折征收地價税之純為體恤人民、並望本府同人、隨時隨地對市民解釋、勸導人民踴躍繳納、以免影響首都建設之進行、而予全國人民以不良之觀感、”</p>

<p>國際經濟概况</p>
<p>一九三六年之國際經濟、已入於復興狀態、蓋自一九三三年以來、重要之貿易國家、本有若許之經濟進步、惟一般皆認為此乃長期衰落之零碎恢復、而非整個世界之全部繁榮、但一九三六年則已不能作如是觀良因整個世界已出於恐慌之深淵、而進於經濟迅速發展之階段、英國英自治領地斯坎底納維亞國家、及其他金磅有聯繫之國家、在貶低幣值後、卽早已入於復興之途、日本美國及若干原料生產之國家在一九三三年、亦已得到經濟之復興、一九三四年與一九三五年之期中、各國存貨漸减生產有限制復值天晴無雨、故一九三六年之世界物價、得有普遍而迅速之躍進、卽原料生產之國家、亦得恢復其購買力、而匯兌穩定、金融寬弘、生產增加、失業减少、運費上漲及航業復興、更顯而易見、至於九月間法郎之貶值、及英美法三國貨幣協定之成立、尤足為世界復興之臂助、惟本年之國際經濟、雖可樂觀、但目前復興之構成、確係由各國自身之改進與繁榮所致、世界貿易之數量、較一九二九年、尚短少百分之二○、且各國之財政預算、已多不能平衡、而國民收入之大部、須用於不生產之軍事建設、此種情形、自易使不均衡之經濟狀狀、重復出現、故一九三七年之各國重要工作、自應將本國之復興基礎放大、使世界貿易得自由發展、而此種工作之先决條件、又當為經濟國家主議之放棄與政治恐懼心理之解除、</p>
<p>國內經濟概况</p>
<p>本年國內經濟漸學繁榮、雖外侮頻仍國難方殷而國內政局安定、政令統一、要為促進經濟好轉之最大因素、蓋以本年各地農產豐收、雜糧產量、均現一致上增之象、農村購買力、因亦提高、有裨於國民經濟之活動者、至大目鉅、年前新幣制政策施行、金融已趨穏定、工商業亦不若以往之蕭條、以故物產外輸頓呈活躍、更以朝野各方、對經濟建設之提倡悉力以赴本年中央政府與地方政府、均以從事經濟建設為施政之重心故整個經濟、均有欣欣向榮之象、</p>
<p>今從貿易樂觀</p>
<p>綜觀本年之對外貿易、較諸往年、顯趨進步、按國幣計值、出口增加百分之三、人口增加百分之二、因出口貿易增加之較鉅、遂形激减一萬零七百餘萬元、貿易趨勢漸見好轉大為可喜揆厥原因、出口貨物因受外匯之裨助、易於推銷、且有數種商品、如桐油皮貨•鑛砂•等項頗能適合海外需求也、入口貨物因國內績極經濟建設、對於建設必需物質、如車輛鋼鐵等品、需求至殷二也、就一般而言自去年十一月間、實施新貨幣政策後國內經濟情况大見改善、則国際貿易之推進乃屬意中之事今後國內統一情形益臻鞏固中央威權益見擴展財政金融、當更有顯著之進步、經濟建設與發展交通、正繼續進行、方興未艾、對於建設所必需之物質、殷望各國予以供給、所期望在另一方面、各國免除國際貿易桎梏將優惠稅則進口比額制與夫滙兌限制加以改善庶幾吾國出口貿易、一往無阻、則來年之國際貿易、當更欣欣向榮、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>“新娘學校”</h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>有岡田德子女士者，為日本東京著名之時裝設計專敎，已於日前乘上海丸來滬，計劇籌設與日本國內相同性質之“新娘學校”一所，聞地址亦已擇定北四川路家庭工藝會計內云。</p>
<p>據說“新娘舉校”在日本各總極為普通，所授的課目不外是撫育新生嬰孩之常識，烹調及裁衣之方法，四季花草之佈置等。這些課目，與其說是“新娘應有之常識，”還不如說是“主婦應有之常識來得恰當。日本婦人所以被稱為‘最善良的婦人，’大概都是受過“新娘學校”的教育，始獲盛名的吧？</p>
<p>在不多幾日之前，曾有位日本東京讀賣新聞婦人欄評論記者，和東洋經濟新聞記者石原清子，在八仙橋青年會主催中日婦女座談，她的談話中有“在我眼中的中國，較之我在理想中的中國進步得多子。特別是中國的婦女生活，在政治上有與男子平等的地位。”這一席話雖是每個到中國來的“外客”都可以見機地應用一番的，不過自五四以來，中國婦女確有不少從廚房裏釋放出來，脚踏實地地做一點事業，那也是實情。然而，以此推測中國婦女在本國或國際的實在地位如何，似乎還是不可能的。三寸金蓮旣在國外傳為美談，“理想伴侶”又終於在中國找到，而現在的岡田德子又要來上海籌設“新娘學校”了。這正是“我們像渾水裏的魚，活得糊裏糊塗，莫名其妙“了。</p>
<p>現在姑且就來談談所謂“新娘學校”罷。照上列的謀目看來、這些“新娘應有之常識”，我國大部份婦女都能懂得的，亦我國婦女“固有之美德，”何勞岡田德子女士用東洋方式來傳教呢？。我想岡田德子女士行裝初卸就會看到這種情形而後侮多此一行吧？不過她幸而到上海，上海是有着介乎石原清子所說的“在政治上有與男子平等地位”和岡田德子想傳敎一新娘應有之常識一乏間的一部份婦女，她們確寶需要一個“新娘學校”，學習一點道地的“新娘應有之常議。”如：結婚禮服之設計，婚禮進行曲之研究，化裝術及其他一切等等，式樣務求美觀，態度合乎大方；而岡田德子女士本來就是個著名的“時裝設計專教，”如能改變初宗，適應潮流，“新娘學樣”未見得不能桃李盈門，財通四海；同時，上海新娘亦幸甚。</p>
<p>不過，她將來回國之後，將發表什麼“中國新娘印象，”那是不在本文預計之內了。</p>
<h3>凑熱鬧</h3>
<p>— 華村</p>
<p>談過了“看熱鬧”，覺得還有談一談“湊熱鬧”的必要。</p>
<p>世有愛看熱鬧成癖者，同時還有以湊熱鬧為生者。前者無所為，而後者有所為。</p>
<p>愛湊熱鬧的人，總是滿臉笑嘻嘻，熱心慷慨，彷彿我佛韓世似的。一些名人的宴會裏，掛着“總理遺像”的什麼集會上，我們總可以看見這些笑嘻嘻、但有時也緊張得若有其事的險，搖來擺去，像蒼蠅一樣。</p>
<p>要人一下台，他們就發起開歡送會，表示依戀，歡送辭裏，說行感激零涕，真是斯人而去，如蒼生何！但明天另一個要人剛上任，他們就又呼朋引類，執着旗子，大摇大擺的到碼頭上歡迎去了。而且還要開茶話會，對新貴人拚命拍着掌，說道找公一出，斯民之幸，真是如大旱之得甘霖，再好也沒有了！一邊歡送，一邊歡迎，他們就永遠這樣忙碌着。</p>
<p>此外則上體天意，或者慷概激昂，開討逆之會：或者鼓舞歡欣，發擁護之電。打聽得某要人今年幾上歲，年高德劬，理應發起做壽；某名流與夫人結婚已經幾年，雖然妾勝滿室，幸而德配尚未拆對，於是乎趕緊湊上去，參加鋠婚或金婚紀念。</p>
<p>然而這些都是高等的。中等一些的便到報上去做文章，歌功頌德：開會時到塲任招待，襟上別一張綢𦅣，在人叢裏趕來趕去，忙得滿頭大汗。看見同輩，笑笑，揩揩汗，又縐縐眉，察其神情</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，若有怨尤，而其實乃是得意。</p>
<p>英皇加冕典禮之類，這些先生們没有“執事”了，於是軋到洋鬼子隊裏去，恭而敬之，不勝神往之至的坐着，以“高等華人”的資格，躬與其盛！</p>
<p>他們是永遠忙碌的，主人忙，他們帮忙，凑熱鬧：主人閑，他們扯淡，做淸客。“金瓶梅”裏的西門大官人，周圍就總環繞着這一類知趣的人物。</p>
<p>鶯鶯嫁人，忙的是紅娘。因爲向同輩鳴鞭，向主人凑熱鬧，都是奴才的美德。—這有個好聽的名詞，呌做“助興”。</p>
<p>有了這一類善於“助興”的華冑，於是乎天下太平，民國萬歳！</p>
<h3>泰山上的爬山虎</h3>
<p>— 馬蜂</p>
<p>“先生，你不要向後靠，你以爲這樣我們走起來省事，可是——我們走起來更不加力呢！”</p>
<p>坐在山轎上從南天門下來，看看那高高的青天，瞧瞧那深谷似地石階，不由得心裏驚慌起來。——這可真不是玩的。危險啊！再望望平列着走下去的兩個“爬山虎”，很輕便地滑下石階，心更加聳縮起來，——倘若他們溜了脚，可……。很不舒服地坐在山轎子上，這些不好的念頭，旋繞在腦子裏。</p>
<p>“先生，你放心好啦！你不知道：下山非這樣走法不成！踏着石頭一歩一歩地往下滑，走起來自然而然的，一點也不費勁！”</p>
<p>我雖然心裏仍在害怕着；可也不好再説，我知道他們對這些是有着些忌諱的。轉過臉去望那像座落在雲彩裏的南天門時，感覺到轎身起着動摇——南天門的影子看不到了！整整地轉了一個圈。原來兩個爬山虎爲了“換肩”，不由地心裏又卜通卜通地跳起來。揉揉眼睛，看到他們不動聲色的神氣，纔輕輕嘘了口氣——</p>
<p>“哎喲！可嚇死我了！”</p>
<p>“先生，你放心，我們是靠山吃飯的“爬山虎”呢！往年除去冬天裏不上山，那真是每月上下三四十趟還許多呢！生意好極啦！每個人都能有吃的，喝的，用的還養活着一大家人家！現在……現在……混到的錢可真是稀鬆一包糟了。年頭不好，誰還有錢再往山上來花？有什麽法子想呢？現在我們的生意都被鐵路賓館裏奪了去了！比方説，每年外國人來逛山吧，我們可以多混他兩個，可是，他們定出價錢來：當天打來回，三塊錢！這三塊錢裏邊還得給他們扣出一塊錢來呢……”</p>
<p>正説着，已經到了雲歩橋，橋下邊的石橋和到中天門的段路，全給水冲壞了。在我下來山轎走的時候，問他是怎的弄到這歩天地。</p>
<p>“這是六月二十四一塲大雨冲壞的！他們山上的人説是龍王爺發的天水，下邊淹死了三個人，裏邊還有個教書的先生呢！現在已經在修理了。”</p>
<p>走下這段路，兩個爬山虎就一前一後地走起來了——路是漸漸地平坦下來了。也不再像在上邊時的冷了。於是又東扯西拉地和他們談起來：</p>
<p>“泰安城裏除去岱廟外，還有什麽有名望的地方呢？”</p>
<p>“除去岱廟麽，泰安有名望的是那“白菜，豆腐，水”啊！”</p>
<p>他的這個答覆是多餘的，泰安這三種有名的東西，我都嘗過了：水確實另有種味道，白菜吃起來没有渣，用豆腐作成的各種花樣，菜食，是“括括老呌”可是我問的不是　　——那個爬山虎緊接這話説：</p>
<p>“人家先生問的你，有名望的地方呢！先生，泰安縣地裏有件頂有名望的東西，你猜是什麽？是從前的縣長的跪像！一個鐵弄成的像，是縣長馮汝驥的跪像！他是張宗昌時代在這裏坐縣長的！他是一個髒官，把俺泰安的地皮都快括光了，他滾蛋的時候，老百姓爲紀念他給後來來坐縣官的看，一個人出一個銅板，凑起來給他弄了個鐵像，跪在縣衙門門口！他股襟上有兩個洋錢樣的東西，上邊有“洋錢”兩個字，這兩個字刻在上邊也是有意思的：因爲縣老爺有兩個帮助他括地皮的人，一個姓楊，一個姓錢！姓楊的是本地人，怕難看，拿出錢來，買通着改成“洋”這個字！”</p>
<p>我感到這件事倒挺有意思，追問他：</p>
<p>“這件事怎麽没聽人説過呢？”</p>
<p>“我哪會騙你呢！是真的，不信，你問問他——”他一面走着，一面從絆帶裏伸出手來指了指他的同伴。“你不，到城裏問問——一點兒也不會錯！先生没聽見人家説過，是因爲到這裏來的人都不留神旁的；光知道一個泰山……後來這馮汝驥的跪像不見了，你猜是怎樣了？是他花上錢，趁南軍和晋軍打仗把它埋了！後來又被人掘出來放在西門裏，現在還在那裏呢！”</p>
<p>坐在山轎忽油忽油地幌動着，回味着這有趣的故事，不禁笑了起來。</p>
<p>走到斗母宫的時候，我們在那外邊停下喝了一氣茶。到斗母宫裏去觀望了那很有名聲的尼姑，有一個長的確實漂亮，生的身段和風采，真使得人迷戀。想到老殘遊記二集裏寫的關於斗母宫裏尼姑的事，感覺到劉鐵雲寫的太真切了。那個很漂亮的尼姑正在佛堂前的桌子上縫一件鮮艷的大紅內衣，我要偷偷地照她一張像的時候，却被她發覺到——跑到後邊屋子裏去了。往下邊走的時候，同兩個爬山虎談起斗母宫裏的尼姑來——</p>
<p>“你以爲她們作鮮紅的衣服出奇嗎？嘿，他媽的，她們才真是些浪貨呢！你有錢他們就能住——”</p>
<p>談到這個，兩個爬山虎來了興頭。一點也不客氣地告訴了我一些她們的事情。我想到報紙上曾經有過“泰安縣尼姑出借生子”的記載，——</p>
<p>“那不是這裏的，那是城東北三十里地××班（名字我記不淸了。）尼姑庵裏的！那裏的尼姑還留着辮子呢！你要是想看尼姑，嘿，最好你三月裏來，自然是陰歷三月裏，十四，十五，十六三天是泰山娘娘的生日，山上唱大戲，近山下的尼姑都來！有的帶辮子，有的還把頭梳得油光，抹上一臉胭脂，擦上一臉粉……”</p>
<h3>廣告</h3>
<p>— 藍佩</p>
<p>——北行記見</p>
<p>當列軍離開了那建築得並不宏偉的泰安車站繼續向北方的大原野前進的時候，從鐵路兩沿一帶迤邐着的泥土堆成的屋牆上，我們發現了新的奇蹟了。</p>
<p>“看，怎麽盡是日本人的廣告？”</p>
<p>韻激昻地發洩着南方人的忿慨。</p>
<p>“山東也捲入特殊的圈子裏了”一行人的心裏緊緊地被同一的感慨絞纒着，無言地從兩旁車窗裏眺望着那些像是没有止處的南方難得看見的廣告。</p>
<p>婦科聖藥：中將湯</p>
<p>保赤一粒金</p>
<p>大學眼藥</p>
<p>老篤眼藥</p>
<p>鬼迷死臭蟲藥水</p>
<p>我們覺得很難過，像悲哀却又像忿怒；一個同一的念頭飄起在我們的心上，國土越來越小了。</p>
<p>“聽説，他們東西的銷路也不壞呢”</p>
<p>同車一位山東老鄉向我們説：</p>
<p>“那麽老百姓都忘記了對日本的仇恨了？”</p>
<p>韻傷感地問着。</p>
<p>“不，不過是日本人的宣傳力大，貨又便宜。老百姓在生着毛病的當兒，看着什麽，就用着什麽了。”</p>
<p>“那麽中國自己的藥呢？”韻搶着問。</p>
<p>“自己的出品你看過多少？”山東老鄉咧開滿口黑牙笑起來，一股濃厚的葱味把對面站着的韻嚇得退到車窗邊連連吐了幾口唾沫。“况且，價錢也貴哪！”</p>
<p>……列車隆隆地駛過鐵橋，躺在鐵橋下的，是北方慣有的没有水的沙漠一樣劃着兩道深澈的車軌的河床。</p>
<p>望着藍天下伸展開去一片無邊際的黄色原野，我們悵然地沉思着。……</p>

<p>[Nanjing] He Yingqin returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 12th and met with Liu Zhi to discuss matters.

Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, and Wang Shutang, who are already in Nanjing, have also been ordered to stay in Nanjing for several more days to participate in the discussions.

As for the 51st Army of Yu Xuezhong's troops, it is scheduled to begin moving from Bengbu to the Huaiyin area starting on the 14th. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Our Authorities Watch British-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to foreign sources, the specific outcome of the British-Japanese negotiations in London on Far Eastern issues is still unknown. Regarding Foreign Minister Sato's remarks to reporters that the negotiations are not detrimental to China, the authorities remain silent and have not expressed any opinions. China's position has long been determined, and it is now closely monitoring the progress of the British-Japanese negotiations. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Amendment of New Salt Law Under Discussion</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Political Council has successively submitted the amendment of Articles 24 and 25 of the New Salt Law, as well as the proposal to determine the national salt district tax rate table, to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Legislative Yuan has now submitted them to the Finance and Legal System Committees for review. Article 24 of the New Salt Law stipulates that salt tax should be levied at a uniform rate of 5 yuan in national currency per 100 kilograms, and no additional taxes or surcharges are allowed. Article 25 stipulates that the tax on fishing salt should be 3 jiao in national currency per 100 kilograms. It is now proposed to amend Article 4, taking into account the current situation of salt tax revenue, to state that the salt tax should not exceed 5 yuan in national currency per 100 "shi jin" (a unit of weight), and the tax rate table will be determined separately. Article 25 will be amended only to change "kilograms" to "shi jin" in accordance with Article 4. The two committees believe that this case is of great importance to the future of salt administration reform and are currently studying it in detail. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sichuan Province Requests Issuance of Disaster Relief Bonds</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Responds Again That the Method is Unsuitable</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the case of the Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, Liu Xiang, previously requesting the issuance of 15 million yuan in disaster relief bonds, due to the unsuitable method of raising funds, he has telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance again, proposing to change the issuance to 12 million yuan in Sichuan Province disaster relief bonds, with an annual interest rate of 6%, to be repaid in 15 years, starting from the 27th year, adding 20% to the land tax in Sichuan as a fund. The principal and interest payments will be handled according to the method of the 25th year's Sichuan Financial Consolidation and Aftermath Bonds. As land taxes have already been reduced in the 26th year due to the severe drought, it is not convenient to collect additional taxes. It is proposed that the 1,248,000 yuan in funds for the 26th year be subsidized by the national treasury. Currently, the Ministry of Finance believes that Chairman Liu's method is still unsuitable and has telegraphed back, saying, "Chairman Liu of Chengdu: Your telegram of the 1st has been read. Regarding your April 17 telegram requesting the issuance of 15 million yuan in Sichuan Province disaster relief bonds, this Ministry replied in the telegram of the 27th, based on the method presented by Director Liu. However, the telegram of the 1st from Director Liu is consistent with Director Liu's presentation. Other aspects, such as the repayment period, the annual amount of principal and interest to be paid, the method of raising funds, and the use of the bonds, are all different from Director Liu's presentation. Since the disaster in Sichuan is so severe, it is not appropriate to raise funds by adding to the land tax, which conflicts with the National Government's decree of June 8, 23, which prohibits adding additional land taxes. Even if the method proposed in your telegram is submitted, the Central Political Council and the Legislative Yuan may not immediately approve it. It is hoped that you will inquire in detail with Director Liu and develop a proper plan, and submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval after completing the procedures for issuing bonds. Respectfully replied, seal of the Ministry of Finance." It is also heard that the Ministry of Finance will separately submit the handling of this case to the Executive Yuan for review. The memorandum also stated that the Sichuan disaster is so severe that requesting the issuance of bonds by adding to the land tax, even if it is delayed until the 27th year, would likely be too much for the people to bear and would likely cause dissatisfaction. The use of these bonds and the implementation methods for disaster prevention and relief have not been explained in detail. Other aspects, such as the repayment period of the bonds and the annual amount of principal and interest to be paid, also differ from Director Liu's presentation. The Ministry has telegraphed Chairman Liu, urging him to develop a proper plan as soon as possible and submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval after completing the procedures for issuing bonds.

<h3>Judicial Yuan Interprets Doubts</h3>
<p>Revoking Cases of Official Property Acquisition</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan previously requested the Judicial Yuan to interpret legal ambiguities regarding the revocation of official property acquisition cases based on the request of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The Judicial Yuan has now responded that for official property and land released by administrative agencies based on their authority, the ownership has been transferred to the acquirer, and the administrative agency cannot arbitrarily change it. However, if it is discovered that the property should not belong to private individuals according to laws and regulations (such as historical sites), the higher-level agency can revoke it in the exercise of its supervisory power. If the property is indeed private property, and the administrative agency mistakenly released it as official property, the original owner can file a civil lawsuit with the judicial authorities and also file an administrative appeal. Before this appeal, the higher-level agency can directly revoke it. The Executive Yuan has now issued an order to inform and instruct. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Principles for Appointing County Magistrates</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The principles for appointing county magistrates have been amended and approved by the Central Political Committee on the 12th. The five items are recorded below in their original text:</p>
<p>㊀ Those who are over 30 years old and have passed the county magistrate examination according to law should be given priority for appointment. In addition, those who possess one of the legal qualifications, having been thoroughly assessed by the civil affairs department of each province regarding their talent, character, knowledge, experience, and physical condition, and deemed competent to serve as county magistrates, shall be reported by the chairmen of the provincial governments to the Ministry of Interior, which will forward the report to the Ministry of Personnel for review. Those who pass the review shall be recorded as county magistrate candidates. The assessment methods shall be determined by the Examination Yuan. Those who possess one of the legal qualifications may be recommended by the administrative departments under the Executive Yuan if deemed necessary, after thorough assessment by the Ministry of Interior and review by the Ministry of Personnel. Those who pass the review shall be recorded as county magistrate candidates. (Explanation: The current qualifications for county magistrate appointment are based on three regulations: 1. "Regulations for the Appointment of County Magistrates," 2. "Regulations for the Appointment of Civil Servants," and 3. "Provisional Measures for Restricting the Appointment of County Magistrates in Bandit Suppression Areas." The coexistence of these three laws creates inconsistencies, which is not in line with the principle of unified personnel management. The reason why the Regulations for the Appointment of County Magistrates cannot be unified is that the original law's qualification restrictions are excessive, and it is difficult to standardize the qualifications of county magistrates in various provinces. As a result, the Regulations for the Appointment of County Magistrates have not been fully implemented, and various remedial measures have been introduced. In order to unify regulations and consider the actual situation, the qualifications stipulated in the previous three regulations, which differ in their stringency, are consolidated into one law. Furthermore, administrative experience, performance, and research conditions are added to attract talent that matches the requirements. Moreover, since the district chiefs who serve in various provinces and districts have heavy responsibilities and complicated tasks, it is difficult for mediocre individuals to handle the job, and the low pay makes it difficult to attract talent. In order to encourage virtuous and capable individuals to serve at the grassroots level and improve the efficiency of district administration, it is stipulated that such district chiefs may be promoted to county magistrates, so that district chiefs who serve the people wholeheartedly may have a path for promotion. In addition, the civil affairs directors of the provincial governments are specifically responsible for identifying county magistrate talent. The assessment is a public way to seek talent, and the recommendation is a responsible way to promote the virtuous, so as to avoid casual recommendations and improve the quality of county magistrate candidates. The assessment methods are stipulated to be determined by the Examination Yuan to create uniform methods for all provinces to follow the law and avoid disputes. Furthermore, the Executive Yuan oversees all national administrative affairs, and due to the implementation of national policies, it needs special talent. For county magistrate candidates who need to be recommended by subordinate agencies, the Executive Yuan may designate them to handle the matter, so as to broadly recruit and respond to the situation.</p>
<p>㊀ If any province has individuals who are of sufficient legal age, possess both talent and virtue, and have administrative knowledge and experience, the chairman of the provincial government may specially recommend them to the Ministry of Interior, and after passing the examination and inquiry by the Examination Yuan, they shall be recorded by the Ministry of Personnel as county magistrate candidates. (Explanation: The stipulation of qualifications is to prevent abuse, but qualification restrictions sometimes hinder the advancement of special virtuous and capable individuals. Currently, there are county magistrates in various provinces who have been appointed by the provincial governments and are competent in their duties, but some outstanding individuals may have difficulty meeting the qualifications. Furthermore, some may be constrained by their qualifications and unable to be appointed. According to the national principle of employing people, if there is noncompliance, it is difficult for the laws to be effectively implemented. Therefore, this draft law has special recommendation provisions to ensure the smooth progress of county administration in various provinces and prevent true talent from being buried. The provincial government must obtain approval from both ministries before making the recommendation, and the candidate must pass the examination and inquiry by the Examination Yuan to prevent abuse.</p>
<p>㊀ All personnel who obtain county magistrate qualifications in accordance with this law must first undergo unified training by the Ministry of Interior before being assigned for appointment. (Explanation: County magistrates are responsible for the actual implementation of national laws and regulations. They must fully understand the spirit of the central government's policies and the intentions of the central administrative leaders in order to faithfully implement them and unify the people's views and achieve the practical effect of national unity. This draft law stipulates that county magistrate candidates must undergo unified training by the Ministry of Interior so that county magistrates are not merely central government officials in form but are also molded by the central government in substance. Once assigned to local areas, they can uphold the central government's policies and be loyal to their duties. The Ministry of Interior is in charge of national civil affairs training and should be responsible for it to unify authority.</p>
<p>㊀ All county magistrates who have been assigned for candidacy, if they do not have more than one year of experience in administrative positions, must first serve as secretaries, section chiefs, bureau chiefs, or district chiefs in the assigned province for one year of internship. Only those who have excellent performance in the provincial government's assessment after the internship period can be formally appointed. County magistrate candidates who are interning, if due to special circumstances, cannot complete the internship or the internship period is not fulfilled, and the provincial government records it as reducible or waivable and consults the Ministry of Interior for approval and forwards it to the Ministry of Personnel for record, the internship period may be reduced or waived. (Explanation: County magistrates are officials who are close to the people and responsible for implementing government policies, so administrative experience is indispensable. Even if they have qualifications and have received training, they may still encounter difficulties or make oversights when dealing with complex matters, and they may not be familiar with the people's feelings. It will be difficult to avoid mistakes, let alone achieve merits. Therefore, this draft law stipulates that they should first serve as county magistrate secretaries, section chiefs, bureau chiefs, or district chiefs to gain experience. These positions are closely related to county administration and are under the guidance and supervision of the county magistrate, so as not to cause problems due to lack of experience. If they can gain experience and achieve results in the above positions, they will be more confident in assuming the post of county magistrate. This is to cultivate talent in the appointment process. Furthermore, if the provincial government needs personnel to fill vacancies for county magistrates, or after strict investigation, believes that the county magistrate candidate does not need to intern, the internship period may also be reduced or waived if there are sufficient reasons. This is to emphasize the authority and responsibility of the provincial government, and the consultation with the Ministry of Interior for approval and forwarding to the Ministry of Personnel for record is to prevent harm and emphasize performance appraisal.</p>
<p>㊀ Current personnel in central government agencies who have the qualifications to be county magistrate candidates as stipulated in this law may be mutually transferred with current county magistrates legally appointed by various provinces. (Explanation: In recent years, central and local administration has often lacked coordination, which has affected the consistent implementation of administrative policies. In order to communicate political situations and eliminate barriers, this draft law stipulates the principle of mutual transfer of central and local government personnel to recruit talent and coordinate internal and external affairs. In addition, the resolution on the principle of selecting county mayors and magistrates in Beijing from the national personnel examination meeting in the 23rd year has been approved by the conference, and the Ministry of Personnel has drafted a proposal based on the principles and sent it to the central government for approval and submission to the Legislative Yuan for review. Therefore, taking advantage of the revision of the regulations for the appointment of county magistrates, the spirit of the proposal is incorporated. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Eliminating the Problem of Smuggling</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Mr. F.W. Maze, Inspector General of the Chinese Maritime Customs, made a statement on the smuggling problem in London yesterday. He said, "Although the anti-smuggling work of the Tianjin Customs has improved slightly recently, the gateway to eastern Hebei has not been strictly guarded. As far as an effective anti-smuggling plan is concerned, the status of the Tianjin Customs has not improved. Unless China's sovereignty in the non-garrison area is effectively restored, and the customs anti-smuggling team can exercise its ordinary duties, the status of the customs may not be improved. In other words, the customs anti-smuggling duties can only be carried out as usual after the armed maritime patrol boats and shore anti-smuggling teams are restored."</p>
<p>At this time of rampant smuggling, it must be said that it is very meaningful for F.W. Maze, who is responsible for the important duties of customs, to frankly put forward the fundamental way to eliminate smuggled goods. F.W. Maze is British. British and Japanese diplomats are also talking about the Chinese issue these days. We hope that those British gentlemen who echo Japan's proposal to reduce Chinese tariffs will think more about what this fellow countryman who has served in China for many years said. Without eradicating the root of smuggling, smuggled goods will never be eliminated, and the harm of smuggling can never be prevented by reducing tariffs.</p>
<p>The clearest sentences in F.W. Maze's speech are: "The customs anti-smuggling duties can only be carried out as usual after the armed maritime patrol boats and shore anti-smuggling teams are restored." The two declarations that the anti-smuggling personnel of the Jianghai Customs have successively issued can just supplement this point. They are willing to fight, and they are willing to sacrifice. However, they are not armed. Empty-handedness cannot ultimately beat iron rulers, wooden sticks, and short guns, or even live ammunition pistols.</p>
<p>So how to restore the arming of anti-smuggling personnel? As F.W. Maze said, "Unless China's sovereignty in the non-garrison area is effectively restored, the customs anti-smuggling team can exercise its ordinary duties, the status of the customs may not be improved." We can thoroughly understand that to restore the power of customs officers to be armed and implement anti-smuggling, we must recover the seized territory and sovereignty. For example, to eliminate smuggling in Shanghai, we must restore China's sovereignty on the Shanghai docks. To eliminate smuggling in North China, we must first recover eastern Hebei, the base camp of smuggling, and then recover the Northeast, the rear camp of smuggling.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of abolishing the puppet organization in eastern Hebei, there have been recent rumors of negotiations. Of course, these rumors are nothing more than a smokescreen. If, as a result of negotiations, eastern Hebei abolishes the existing puppet organization but in reality still cannot get rid of the special zone, then eastern Hebei must still be a paradise for smuggling vagrants. We must never tolerate such a state. What we demand is the effective restoration of sovereignty and the effective recovery of territory. In this way, smuggling and all issues between China and Japan can be completely resolved.</p>
<p>Of course, we are not advocating that, in addition to striving for these fundamental points, we can give up all other work. Before the territory and sovereignty are truly recovered, "rejecting smuggling" is also a necessary task to be effectively implemented. Students in Peiping and Tianjin have now launched a "Reject Smuggling Alliance." We hope that people across the country will rise up to respond and block the way out for smuggled goods.</p>
<h3>London Becomes the Center of World Politics</h3>
<p>Eden is very busy with diplomatic maneuvers, and his talks with Russia and Poland are particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden is very busy with diplomatic maneuvers and holding talks with the foreign ministers of various countries who are currently here to attend the coronation ceremony. In particular, Eden's talks with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, and French Foreign Minister Delbos are attracting the attention of the general public. Colonel Beck held talks with Foreign Secretary Eden in the office of the Polish Ambassador Count Rytas after the Polish ambassador's banquet this afternoon. The talks lasted for a long time. It is reported that Colonel Beck explained Poland's current stance on Germany and Russia and pointed out that Poland is now planning to follow the example of Belgium and declare neutrality. If this can be done, Poland will prepare to submit it to the league. It is also reported that Poland has now decided to stay out of international disputes, so it is unwilling to hear about the Austro-Hungarian incident and will stop negotiations with Romania. (Note: Colonel Beck recently visited Romania and held talks with the country's authorities.) Eden agreed with Beck to continue their meeting by the end of this week, around the 14th of this month. Colonel Beck then went to the French Embassy to meet with French Foreign Minister Delbos, and the same issue was discussed. They also discussed the meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council and the Provisional Assembly in Geneva at the end of this month. Finally, Beck went to Buckingham Palace to visit Prince Paul, the first regent of Yugoslavia, to discuss business issues between the two countries. On the other hand, Foreign Secretary Eden met with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov at the Foreign Office. It is generally known that Litvinov raised the issue of the situation in Spain and the work of the Non-Intervention Committee, and insisted that Italy and Germany should be prevented from supplying aircraft to the Spanish Nationalist Army again. Foreign Secretary Eden believes that the civil war in Spain should be resolved as soon as possible and has reportedly stated to Litvinov that France and Russia should issue a joint declaration again to explain that the mutual assistance pact between France and Russia is not intended to deal with Germany, so as to ease Germany's uneasiness and allow the country to participate in the future Western European pact. Foreign Secretary Eden then met with German Foreign Minister Schmidt and continued talks on the issue of economic cooperation among the countries in the Danube River basin. In the evening, Foreign Secretary Eden attended a banquet at the French Embassy, and after the banquet, he held talks with the French Foreign Minister together with Foreign Secretary Sir Vansittart. It is reported that Eden insisted that the British government is determined to continue negotiations on the Western European pact, and with regard to the investigation work carried out by Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland (referring to the investigation work on removing obstacles to international trade), he said that after the investigation has yielded results, Britain will seriously consider it.

<h3>It is rumored that Japan recognizes the rebel government of Western countries</h3>

(Reuters dispatch on the 12th by Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently firmly denied the rumors that Japan has recognized the Spanish Franco government with the condition that the government must sign a commercial treaty. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also denied the Tokyo news reported by France that some parties believed that General Franco and the Japanese Army were conducting secret negotiations, and said that the French rumors that the Japanese Army was eager to recognize the Franco government in order to obtain raw materials needed for manufacturing military equipment were also absurd and baseless.

<h3>Mixed Battles on All Fronts in Spain</h3>
<p>Government troops besiege Toledo, and Madrid continues to be bombarded.</p>
<p>Hengtai According to border news, there were fierce battles on four fronts in Spain tonight, with countless casualties. Rebel troops bombarded Madrid, killing 60 and injuring 130. Basque troops launched a counterattack in the dark and rain, and drove back General Mullah's Ler army, recapturing all the important points of Mount Solov. Toledo is said to have been breached by government troops and is currently in street fighting. In the Guadarrama area, both sides bombed the enemy's rear with aircraft. According to reports from various parties, the government troops have won many victories, but the bulletins issued by the rebel troops are the opposite. (National Electricity on the 12th)</p>
<p>Guernica The Nationalist troops yesterday used artillery and aircraft to bombard fiercely on the Basque front, and after another attack, they immediately occupied all the positions in the Viscargüez mountain area and controlled the Laiarabecha and Gardagano river basins. The Gardagano River is the center of the defense works of the port of Bilbao, and its importance is evident. The military affairs of the Nationalist troops on the Basque front are personally commanded by General Mullah, the commander of the Northern Route. As a result of the fierce fighting in recent days, the government troops have suffered heavy casualties. It is reported that more than 1,000 people have died and about 2,500 people have been injured. (Havas dispatch on the 12th by Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Madrid More than 100 large-caliber shells were fired from the dark artillery positions on the Spanish Nationalist Army's front line, most of which landed in the city of Madrid, but some of the high-rise buildings in the suburbs were destroyed by the shells. All the houses in the Gran Vía area were destroyed. When the shelling occurred, the residents of the city of Madrid panicked and took refuge in basements or underground stations. All the trams were stopped. The intensity of this shelling was unprecedented, killing 40 people and injuring more than 150 people. (Reuters dispatch on the 12th by Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Parties Move to the Cabinet</h3>
<p>The cooperation between the Zhengmin parties is gradually becoming concrete.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Minseito Party held a members' meeting on the 7th, and the Seiyukai Party held a members' meeting on the 11th, and formally decided on a policy of overthrowing the current cabinet, and resolved to cooperate with the public to realize a unified national cabinet to implement reform policies and overcome the difficulties of the times. In order to achieve this month's goal, the two parties plan to start with the work of political and public cooperation, that is, Minseito Party representative Koizumi and Seiyukai representative Matsuno are scheduled to contact various matters in the next day or two, and schedule a formal meeting between the leaders of the two parties to discuss the specific method of overthrowing the current cabinet, and hold a joint friendship conference between the members of the two parties at an appropriate time and jointly declare the overthrow of the cabinet to arouse national opinion.

<h3>Russian Deputy Defense Commissar Transferred to Another Post</h3>
<p>Equivalent to Exile</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the transfer of Soviet Deputy People's Commissar of Defense, General Tukhachevsky, to the post of commander of the Volga Military District, the Moscow correspondent of the "Petit Parisien" newspaper recently declared that Tukhachevsky and People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov were both promoted to the rank of general ten months ago, seemingly trusted by the dictator Stalin. However, recently, his adjutant, Smudny, plotted to harm Stalin but was not detected in time. Moreover, because Tukhachevsky came from nobility and his ambition was said to rival that of Napoleon I, he aroused suspicion and was demoted to an idle position, which is practically equivalent to exile in a remote area. Furthermore, according to news from Berlin, German political figures also regard this move as an exile, which is clear evidence that the Soviet government intends to place the country's army under political control.

(National Maritime Telegraph, 12th dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] King George VI of England held a solemn and respectful coronation ceremony at 12:31 this noon in Westminster Abbey, under the watchful eyes of representatives from all countries around the world.

After the coronation ceremony of the English King was completed, the English Queen was then crowned, and the ceremony was also conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

The coronation ceremony in Westminster Abbey ended at 2:00 PM. The King and Queen departed from Buckingham Palace at 10:33 AM and did not return to the palace until 4:04 PM, a difference of five and a half hours. When the King and Queen's carriage returned to the palace, heavy rain poured down just as the carriage entered the front courtyard. However, the enthusiasm of the crowds outside the palace did not diminish at all. (Central News Agency, 12th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Crowds Blocked the Streets</h3>
<p>[London] The areas through which the King George VI coronation procession passed were closed to traffic from midnight last night. A large number of tourists strolled along the main streets. Women outnumbered men by about ten to one. The usual reserved demeanor of the British had transformed into joyful singing and dancing. People of all classes and nationalities sang and danced in the streets. The hotels were also extremely lively. People from the provinces arrived by train in an endless stream, and the stations were extremely crowded. The fog gradually thickened at 2:00 AM and was not expected to dissipate until after dawn. Streetcars and subways began running at 4:00 AM, carrying residents to the central district. By 5:30 AM, there were already over 50,000 people on Moore Street. By 7:00 AM, there was no room to stand along the procession route. Lords and Ladies, in carriages or on foot, carried their crowns and headed to Westminster Abbey to await the arrival of the royal family.</p>
<h3>Preparations in the Palace</h3>
<p>At that time, the meteorological station issued a report stating that the morning would be mostly sunny, although there might be occasional showers limited to certain areas. The staff at Buckingham Palace were ready from dawn. The horses in the Royal Mews were also saddled and inspected by the Duke of Beaufort, the Master of the Horse. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth had finished their breakfast in the palace. However, as the singing in front of the palace had continued all night, they seemed unable to sleep well. After breakfast, they changed into their coronation robes. At that time, people of all kinds participating in the parade arrived at the palace grounds in an endless stream of carriages. The crowds cheered them frequently. They included the Indian Lancers, the London Mounted Police, the red-uniformed and burly Royal Guards, the brightly armored cavalry, the Royal Bodyguard, the Australian Commonwealth and New Zealand contingents, the Canadian Mounted Police, and the Boy Scouts. The Lord Mayor of London, Sir Harry Twyford, had already departed for Westminster Abbey in the city's traditional carriage.</p>
<h3>The Procession</h3>
<p>At 8:30 AM, the first batch of seventy carriages, carrying distant members of the royal family and foreign special envoys and ambassadors, departed from Buckingham Palace and arrived at the Abbey at 9:00 AM. At 9:15 AM, the prime ministers of the various self-governing dominions of the Empire departed from the palace for the Abbey in carriages. Prime Minister Baldwin's carriage led the way, followed by Canadian Prime Minister King and Australian Commonwealth Prime Minister Lyons. At that time, the King and Queen had already changed their coronation robes, and the orchestra played Scottish music in the palace corridors. At 10:00 AM, although the weather was still cloudy, there was a tendency to clear up. By 10:30 AM, a red sun finally broke through the clouds. The King and Queen then departed for Westminster Abbey to perform the ceremony. (Central News Agency, 12th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Coronation Details</h3>
<p>[London] Today, the stained glass windows of Westminster Abbey glittered, the candelabras were lit high, the silver light shone, and the gold and purple light reflected each other, creating a spectacular scene. The central altar was made of pure gold, with several famous objects such as golden plates and ewers next to it. In front of the altar was a golden carpet edged with purple, which was the venue for the coronation. Further ahead was a five-tiered small platform on which the English throne was placed, with the Queen's seat to its left, two tiers lower. In front of the throne was the Edward the Confessor's chair, on which successive English monarchs since Edward have sat to be anointed and crowned. Among the nobles in fragrant clothes and elaborate hairstyles today were sixteen elderly women with white hair, representing the mothers of the English heroes who died for the King in the European War, all wearing their sons' medals on their chests.</p>
<p>Guests Seated</p>
<p>The first members of the royal family to arrive at Westminster Abbey today were the Queen's parents, the Earl and Countess of Strathmore. By 8:45 AM, all eight thousand guests had entered the Abbey. Fifteen minutes later, the first procession slowly arrived in the center of the Abbey, consisting of royal dignitaries from various countries and representatives of various countries.</p>
<p>The Royal Family Takes Their Seats</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM, bishops and clergymen took the royal treasures from the altar and walked slowly through the center to a side room, placing the St. Edward's Crown, the scepter, the sword, and the orb on a table, to await the dignitaries to carry them and join the royal procession. At this time, the choir was led in by the clergy, singing hymns, responding to each other, solemnly and movingly. At 10:15 AM, the royal family entered slowly, and the congregation all stood up to greet them. Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose were led in by their aunt. The two little princesses, wearing long gold and purple robes, walked in front of the eldest princess, their steps neatly aligned, but Rose was young and seemed to have more difficulty keeping up. Next, the Duchess of Gloucester and the Duchess of Kent, wearing long robes, entered and took their seats in the royal family section to the right of the altar. At 10:35 AM, the Queen of Norway arrived, escorted by guards. Next, the Queen Mother entered, wearing the Riband and dazzling diamonds, her long robe carried by four red-clad pages. The Queen of Norway and the Queen Mother slowly entered the royal family section, greeted by the Duchess of Gloucester and escorted to their seats. After the Queen Mother took her seat, the front row of the royal family section was complete, with the Earl of Strathmore closest to the altar, followed by the Countess, the Duchess of Kent, the Duchess of Gloucester, the Queen of Norway, the Queen Mother Mary, and the two little princesses.</p>
<p>The Main Characters Arrive</p>
<p>Then the trumpets sounded together, and the choir sang the hymn "I Was Glad." Everyone knew that the English King and Queen had arrived and were changing clothes in the side room. At this time, the Abbey was filled with golden light, and the guests in the Abbey craned their necks to look. Dignitaries wearing medals and carrying the emblems of various parts of the Empire walked in slowly. Next, four warriors led the way, followed by Prime Minister Baldwin and the prime ministers of the various self-governing dominions.</p>
<p>When the English King and Queen entered the Abbey, several people carried the royal items in front, the Queen followed behind, and the King followed behind the Queen. When the Queen entered, her face was pale and solemn. She walked slowly towards the choir stalls. When the King entered, he wore the royal crown on his head and looked straight ahead. The spectators on both sides bowed in respect.</p>
<p>The Recognition Ceremony</p>
<p>After the King and Queen knelt and prayed privately, they sat on the "Coronation Chair" to perform the recognition ceremony. Then the Archbishop of Canterbury, accompanied by the Lord High Chancellor and the Chief Commissioner of Police, Earl of Cromer, went to the east, south, west, and north platforms. At each side, the Archbishop announced in a loud voice to the congregation, "Gentlemen, I here present unto you King George, your undoubted King: Wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?" The congregation shouted "God Save King George." Then the trumpets sounded together. Then the oath was taken. The Archbishop asked the King, "Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa, of all Your Possessions and other Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, and the Empire of India, according to their respective laws and customs?" The King replied in a low and clear voice without hesitation, "I solemnly promise so to do." The Archbishop then asked, "Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgements?" The King said "I will." The Archbishop then asked several more questions, and the King answered each one in a low voice. Then he went to the altar.</p>
<p>Swearing and Kissing the Bible</p>
<p>Kneeling before the Crown, placing his right hand on the Bible, he swore, "The things which I have here before promised, I will perform, and keep. So help me God." Then he kissed the Bible and signed his name on the oath. Then the first part of the Holy Communion was performed, and the choir recited the creed. Everyone faced the altar, and the coronation ceremony entered a religious ritual.</p>
<p>The Anointing Ceremony</p>
<p>Soon after, the anointing ceremony was performed. The scene at that time was magnificent. The bishops stood respectfully to the left of the King and Queen, and the senior officials of the various countries stood respectfully to their right, wearing large red and white ermine robes. The Queen's train was very long, alternating between purple and gold, and her bodice was covered with diamonds, dazzlingly. The King took off his crown, revealing his black hair. During the singing of a hymn by the choir, the King was stripped of his red robe by the Grand Chamberlain. The King then walked to the St. Edward's Chair in front of the altar and sat down. Four noble gentlemen held a canopy over the King's head. The Archbishop then anointed the King's hands, head, and chest with holy oil. The King stood bareheaded in a white shirt, white trousers, and white socks, looking like a young man. The hearts of the spectators were all moved. The Queen watched intently from the side as the King performed various ceremonies. After the anointing ceremony was completed, the King put on a gold cloth outer garment, offered spurs and a sword, and then put on the coronation robe, offering the orb and scepter. The scene was unforgettable for those who saw it.</p>
<p>Subjects Pledging Allegiance</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM, the crowd all stood up, and there was a rustling sound in the Abbey. The Bishop of Westminster took the royal crown from the altar and handed it to the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop then raised it high and placed it on the King's head. The crowd shouted "God Save the King." People outside the Abbey also shouted in response. The time was 12:30 PM. The King's coronation was complete. The rustling sound in the Abbey resumed, as the nobles all placed their crowns on their heads, completing it in an instant. Then the solemn oath of allegiance was performed.</p>
<p>After the blessing was completed, the King ascended the throne, with his guards and officials on the left and right. First, the eldest Archbishop knelt and read the oath of allegiance and kissed the King's left cheek. At that time, the King wore a wide robe, the royal crown, and sat upright on the throne. When the nobles stepped forward to express their allegiance, their crowns were held by pageboys in white clothes and white trousers.</p>
<p>The Queen's Coronation</p>
<p>After the oath of allegiance was completed, the Queen, supported by five people carrying her beautiful train, ascended the altar and bowed before the King as she passed by. Her ceremony was simpler than the King's and took less time. Then the princesses and noble ladies each placed their crowns on their heads. The first to perform this ceremony in the royal box was Princess Elizabeth. It was not easy to place the crown on Princess Rose's head. After the ceremony was completed, the Queen walked to her throne, which was set to the King's left, bowing as she passed before the King.</p>
<p>The Entire Ceremony Completed</p>
<p>Then the coronation ceremony entered the final act, ending with the Holy Communion amidst the loud singing of hymns. Then the King and Queen returned to the west door and left the Abbey amidst the loud playing of the national anthem. The scene at that time was even more magnificent and pleasing to the eye than when they entered the Abbey.</p>
<p>Returning to the Palace by Royal Carriage</p>
<p>At nearly 2:00 PM, the ceremonies inside the Abbey were completed. The troops outside the Abbey had already prepared to return to the palace and began to set off. The first carriage, carrying Prime Minister Baldwin and his wife, did not leave the Abbey until 2:16 PM. The Queen Mother's glass carriage followed closely behind, with the two little princesses and their grandmother riding together. At that time, the bells inside the Abbey rang loudly, and the shouts of the crowds inside and outside the Abbey went straight to the sky. The King and Queen ascended the royal carriage together at 2:40 PM.</p>
<p>The Weather Did Not Cooperate</p>
<p>As soon as the King and Queen left the Abbey, a heavy rain suddenly fell, but the enthusiasm of the people along the way was not diminished. Cheers thundered as the royal carriage passed by. Thirty-seven thousand London schoolchildren had gathered on the banks of the River Thames to watch the spectacle. Along the way, heads were packed together, mostly wearing raincoats, and some threw their hats into the air to express their excitement.</p>
<p>Foreign dignitaries in Buckingham Palace stood in front of the palace windows to watch the King and Queen's return. At 4:04 PM, the royal carriage entered the south gate of the palace in the pouring rain. The accompanying troops marched in the rain, so they were soaked all over, the wetness penetrating to their skin. At that time, the palace guards played the national anthem loudly.</p>
<p>Thanking the People</p>
<p>After the King and Queen arrived at the palace, the crowds outside the palace did not disperse for a long time, singing the national anthem and shouting "We want to see the King." Princess Elizabeth stood briefly at the window. At 4:40 PM, the King and Queen walked to the balcony in front of the palace and bowed to the crowd to express their gratitude. The two little princesses, wearing small golden crowns, followed closely behind. Then the Queen Mother Mary and the Duke of Kent also arrived. The crowds all took off their hats and stood in the heavy rain, singing the national anthem again before dispersing. (Central News Agency, 12th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Coronation Attendees All in White Satin Breeches</h3>
<p>People's Front Delegates From Various Countries Allowed to Wear Tailcoats</p>
<p>[London] According to court etiquette, for every grand ceremony, those attending to offer congratulations must wear white satin breeches and white stockings. This custom has been followed for hundreds of years. At this coronation of the King, however, because French Foreign Minister Delbos, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, and Spanish Republican government special envoy Pestiero were all granted special permission to wear ordinary tailcoats, without the need for breeches and stockings, the People's Front countries will also show their difference in clothing. However, American diplomats, who have always advocated the democratization of clothing, will this time follow British court rituals and wear breeches. The Spanish Republican government's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Asgalade, will also wear breeches and white stockings, as this is the custom for ambassadors to the United Kingdom, and he does not wish to change it lightly.

<h3>The Duke of Windsor's Wedding Issue</h3>
<p>Stand-off Between the Royal Family and the Government</p>
<p>[London] The Associated Press learned today that a dispute has arisen between the royal family and the government regarding the Duke of Windsor's wedding. Members of the royal family want to participate formally, but the government opposes participation, whether formal or not. It is understood that since Miss Wallis Warfield's (i.e., Mrs. Simpson) divorce decree officially took effect, the royal family has dispatched the Duke and Duchess of Kent to attend the wedding. However, the government strongly disapproves and has also expressed disappointment at the Duke of Windsor's meeting with Mrs. Simpson in Menzingen. The two sides are currently at a standstill. The royal family believes that this is a family matter, while the government believes that this move will damage the people's enthusiasm for supporting the new King and Queen.

<h3>Lively Scenes in London</h3>
<p>Streets Crowded With People, Hardly Any Space. Some Even Brought Food and Slept Outdoors to Await the Dawn. The Entire Police Force Mobilized to Maintain Order.</p>
<p>[London] Last night, before it was even dark, crowds had already gathered along the route of the coronation procession, preparing to wait all night in order to get a better viewing position. By midnight, the entire route was filled with four or five rows of people. When thousands of store employees and office workers left their offices in the evening, they saw that the streets were already full, and everyone wanted to choose a place to watch the procession, which stretched about two and a half miles from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace. Many women sat high on the steps of the Piccadilly Circus, thinking that they were in a high position and could see clearly, but the police stopped them, telling them that the military authorities would use this place as a signal station. The women were greatly disappointed and left. It rained heavily all morning yesterday, but it stopped in the evening. The crowds flocked to the West End by train, streetcar, car, and carriage. Most of those who arrived in London earliest came from the provinces. Among them were some who were very old, and others who even brought tents, preparing to sleep in the streets. A young Scout instructor from Czechoslovakia left home on April 4 and walked across Europe to watch the ceremony. Last night, the authorities decided to open Hyde Park all night, and the crowds quickly turned it into a large campsite. More than a thousand people were camped out in Trafalgar Square last night. Most of them wore clothes that were both warm and waterproof. According to a message from the Ministry of Aviation at 9:30 PM last night, the weather was still uncertain, and thunderstorms were expected before noon on the 12th. After that, the climate would be cold and cloudy, with a tendency to continue raining. However, regardless of the weather, the soldiers participating in today's parade would not wear overcoats. The West End's scenery this morning reminded people of the grand celebration of the previous King's 25th anniversary of his accession to the throne. Streetcars traveling back and forth were full of cheering and singing people. At midnight, Piccadilly Circus was extremely crowded. Men and women stood on the upper level of streetcars, waving flags and cheering. There were also people holding concerts on the roadside. The police pushed through the crowd to stop them. At 1:00 AM, the police placed barriers at the foot of Constitution Hill to block traffic directly to the palace. As midnight approached, the fog became thicker, and the streets were shrouded in thick fog. No one knew how many tens of thousands of people were sleeping soundly on the sidewalks of the various streets. The police allowed the crowds to lie down on the stands, but they had to leave by 4:00 AM this morning. (Central News Agency, 11th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Today, more than 200,000 people from the provinces came to the capital to watch the ceremony. The railroads will run fifty special trains. The consumption of food is expected to be enormous. Along the parade route, stalls have been temporarily set up along the streets and in the parks to sell food to satisfy the spectators' hunger. The government has temporarily set up stages in Hyde Park and Green Park, with food and beverage outlets selling drinks, milk, and various fruit juices. It is estimated that the drinks and food stored include 12,500 kilograms of tea, 6 tons of sugar, 75,000 liters of milk, 100,000 ham sandwiches, 100,000 cakes, and 5,000 boxes of fried sweet potatoes. (Central News Agency, 11th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] When the coronation ceremony is held tomorrow, the parade will pass through the streets, and the spectators will number in the millions. From midnight today, spectators have been standing on the sidewalks along the road, packed together, making vehicular traffic extremely difficult. Therefore, it is not easy for the police to maintain order. Fortunately, the police authorities have made various preparations in advance to prevent accidents. The entire police force of London, 25,000 officers, will change into newly made uniforms tomorrow morning and be transferred to the streets through which the parade passes to maintain order. The original police posts in various places will be temporarily guarded by 8,000 supplementary police. All police officers have been dispatched from midnight today. Wooden and iron barriers have been stored everywhere on the streets to temporarily block the crowds and prevent incidents from happening. Temporary first-aid stations have been set up in Scotland Yard, where the national criminal investigation department is located, and in various parks, with several ambulances parked there. They can rush to the rescue as soon as a warning is received. A special police force has been set up near Westminster Abbey to protect it. Tomorrow, all police officers will be on duty in the Scotland Yard intelligence room, and the details of the parade will be reported to all senior officers at any time by telephone and loudspeaker. Specialists will be hired at key locations to use loudspeakers to advise the crowds to maintain order. In addition, the political police have also made preparations in secret to protect the important domestic and foreign figures attending the coronation ceremony. For several weeks, political police officers have secretly investigated the names of residents of houses along the streets through which the parade passes, and those watching on balconies. Not only that, the British ports have also been carefully interrogating incoming passengers to prevent troublemakers from mixing in. Regarding this, the London political police have been in contact with provincial and foreign police authorities for several months to prevent incidents in advance.

<h3>Southern Irish Republicans Oppose Enthroning the English King</h3>
<p>Parades and Demonstrations Clash with Police; Parliament Discusses New Draft Constitution</p>
<p>Dublin, last night: Republican processions and demonstrations against the coronation of the English king as King of Ireland, and demanding the immediate restoration of the Irish Republic, led to clashes here. Police fired shots over the heads of the crowds to intimidate them. The parade originally intended to hold a mass rally at Grangegorman Mental Hospital at its end, but the Minister of Justice prohibited the demonstration and deployed a large number of police to the city center to be on guard. At the time, Parliament was discussing the second reading of the Constitution Bill, so additional guards were placed near the parliament building. Subsequently, clashes occurred between the police and the masses on O'Connell Street and Beresford Street, the location of Liberty Hall where the headquarters of the volunteer army was established during the 1916 uprising, injuring several people. Before the police dispersed the crowd, demonstrators listened to their leaders read telegrams of sympathy sent from the All-India Congress and the American Irish Republican organizations.</p>
<p>During the parliamentary discussion of the second reading of the Constitution Bill, Executive Council President Éamon de Valera declared that abolishing the laws requiring oaths of allegiance to the English king and the office of Governor-General was the first step in implementing the new constitution, with the new constitution being the third step. The plan is now to restore Ireland's ancient name, Eire, which is respected in the hearts of all Irish people worldwide. The President of Eire will defend all the rights of the people, but there is absolutely no question of a dictatorship system. The President will be elected by the people, and the parliament will define his powers. Yesterday, when the Parliament convened, its flagpoles did not display the tricolor flag as usual, which the residents of Dublin found strange. According to authorities, this was because the flag rope was broken and there was no other rope available to replace it for the time being. (Central News Agency, 12th, Reuters)</p>

As for the film photographers, only six will be allowed inside, all in small rooms with only the lens of the camera exposed. After the film is shot, the footage will be inspected and edited before it can be released to the public. In addition, people from various countries (except Italians) will be inside the church, using radio transmitters to describe the ceremony in their respective languages to report to radio listeners.

<h3>London Transport Workers' Strike Unlikely to Spread</h3>
<p>[London] The possibility of the London bus strike spreading to trams and streetcars has now greatly decreased, as the Transport and General Workers' Union decided last night that it was not appropriate to escalate the dispute at this stage. According to the executive committee of the union, they have carefully studied the report of the court of inquiry regarding the strikers' demands. They are currently writing to the striking bus workers to discuss the matter. This means that the union will ask the Central Busmen's Committee to reconsider everything. The union will also make strong representations to the committee, urging it to accept the court's report and the final proposal of the London Passenger Transport Board. It is expected that the 25,000 strikers will meet this month or tomorrow to consider this recommendation. The Transport Board has proposed that, in addition to the seven-and-a-half-hour workday, it is willing to consider all the issues raised by the workers, such as speeding up driving, frequent changes in schedules, and the lack of fixed meal times.

<h3>Ten Major Powers Enjoyed by the English King</h3>
<p>But Will Never Actually Be Exercised</p>
<p>The new King George VI has been crowned. Many people want to ask, do the powers enjoyed by the new king compare to those of any monarch in British history? Some people say without hesitation that the cabinet—not the House of Commons—now holds the highest power in Britain. However, these people forget that the king still wields great power, should he choose to exercise it.</p>
<p>The English King can implement the following ten things without consulting Parliament:</p>
<p>㊀ He has the power to disband the army; ㊁ He can dismiss all officers, from the commander-in-chief downwards; ㊂ He can dismiss the officers and soldiers of the navy; ㊃ He can sell all warships and naval supplies; ㊄ In the event of a British military defeat, he can sacrifice all his Duchy of Cornwall and negotiate peace with the enemy; ㊅ He can wage war to conquer other countries for Britain; ㊆ He can ennoble any male or female citizen of Great Britain; ㊇ He can make any parish in Great Britain a university; ㊈ He can dismiss most civil servants; ㊉ He can pardon all criminals.</p>
<p>These powers are quite extensive. If Britain engages in war, these powers could undo all the efforts of the nation. Although no one has ever thought that King George would exercise these powers, he does indeed enjoy them according to the constitution.</p>
<p>The English King will approve any document presented by the responsible minister. This is, of course, well known. Some even say that if both houses agreed to send him his own death warrant, he would still have to sign it.</p>
<p>Queen Victoria signed many documents in the past, but she often protested. Sir Sidney Lee said, "She often wrote to a cabinet member saying that although she never agreed with this or that suggestion, she still often listened to him when needed, and formally signed her approval.</p>
<p>King George VI still has the power to refuse to assent to bills passed by Parliament, but the king has not exercised this power since Queen Anne ascended the throne.</p>
<p>Some people believe that the King cannot leave Britain while in office without the consent of Parliament. However, in the early years of George I, this clause in the law was repealed to allow him to travel to Hanover. Edward VII exercised his right to travel abroad on several occasions. George V set a new precedent by going to India to be crowned Emperor.</p>
<p>King George VI, if he wishes, can commute or reduce the sentences of criminals. The custom of submitting lists of death sentences to the king was abolished when the young Queen Victoria ascended the throne. Parliament passed a law giving the Home Secretary the prerogative of remission and commutation of sentences. Although the Home Secretary is still responsible for this, he does so in the name of the King. There is an old saying, "The King can do no wrong." This has become actual law. For example, if the English King forges a check, he cannot be summoned to court for questioning. If he damages the reputation of any person, he cannot be accused of defamation. Professor Dicey's book "The Law of the Constitution" states that if the English King personally shoots his Prime Minister, no court can prosecute him. Although the English King cannot be sued in his own court, he can sue others for their offenses.</p>
<p>The English King's car does not have license plates, and the speed of travel is not restricted. The English King's telegrams must be sent first and free of charge. His letters do not need postage stamps and must be delivered free of charge.</p>
<p>King George, if he wishes, can ride in a carriage all the way to Rotten Row in Hyde Park. The English King can purchase houses or land, but according to the law, he cannot rent, because the King cannot be someone's tenant or be bound by the people.</p>
<p>The English King does not pay income tax. All his property comes from the rights of the monarch. Queen Victoria and King Edward VII both paid income tax. Queen Victoria first paid because the people at that time regarded income tax as a heavy tax, so she first paid as an example for the people. King only became exempt from this tax when George V ascended the throne.</p>
<p>The English King's palaces do not pay municipal rates, nor does he pay death taxes. However, his private property must be taxed in the same way as the people.</p>
<p>The officers and servants who serve King George in the royal court cannot be arrested by the police. They also have no obligation to serve as jurors.</p>
<p>The English King has a right that he will never enjoy, which is the right to vote. Even the lowest laborer on the King's estate in Sandringham has the right to vote, but the King's name cannot be found on the voter registration list for the Sandringham parish. People hope that the English King will maintain strict neutrality in politics.</p>
<p>When King George goes to the theater, even if he is sitting in the royal box, he must pay for his ticket. He attends the theater in a private capacity. Except for performances or charity exhibitions on holidays, newspapers cannot announce his scheduled outings. Furthermore, when he attends the theater in a private capacity, national music should not be played loudly when entering the theater to attract people's attention.</p>
<p>All of the above are the powers enjoyed by the new King George VI after ascending the throne. There are many kinds and they are great, so many people may be surprised to see them, and even the King himself may be surprised. The various powers enjoyed by the English King listed in the first part of this article were drafted by Mr. Bagehot, a shrewd thinker, banker, and writer, during the reign of Queen Victoria. Someone sent his article to the Queen to read, and the Queen exclaimed, "Why, the wicked man has written such a thing! My people will not believe it!" Although she was doubtful, the great legal scholars of England had to admit that the King enjoyed these powers. Today, when King George is on the throne, it is still indisputable. However, it is a certainty that the new King will not exercise these powers.</p>

<h3>Yu Xuezhong to Assume New Post in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Former Northeastern Army to Comply with Orders for Reorganization; Yu's Troops Prepare to Enter and Station in Jiangsu</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondent: After Yu Xuezhong was appointed as the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner, he went to Nanjing via Shanghai and Jinan to consult with Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin and Liu Zhi, Chairman of the Military Reorganization Committee of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, regarding the implementation of the reorganization of the former Northeastern Army. It is reported that the divisions of the former Northeastern Army will comply with the central government's reorganization measures and be reorganized, changing from the original two-regiment system per division to a two-brigade system per division, with two regiments per brigade, totaling four regiments per division. The directly subordinate units will also be reorganized, completely reorganized into national defense forces. During the reorganization period, each unit will still receive disaster relief pay. Once the reorganization is completed, all pay will be directly issued by the Ministry of Military Affairs. From then on, the term "Northeastern Army" will become a historical term. Yu may inspect his troops in Bengbu in the near future, and then proceed to Huaiyin to assume his new post. In addition to the 51st Army's Li Mouzhou's 3rd Division and directly subordinate units, the 110th Division of Zhang Zhengfang stationed in Mengcheng will also move there. Yu's troops will be stationed in the five counties of Northern Jiangsu: Huaiyin, Siyang, Shuyang, Suqian, and Suining. The deployment is roughly in place. The 26th Route Army of Sun Lianzhong has already ceded its defense area, and its 30th Division has temporarily moved to Huaian, while its 27th Division, 31st Division, and Independent 44th Brigade have been completely transferred to Henan and have already departed separately. Yu's troops are preparing to depart to take over the defense, which will take about a month to complete. As for the routes into Jiangsu, there are a total of three routes, both water and land. The baggage and equipment will be transported east by boat along the Huai River, through Hongze Lake, transferred to the Qing River, across the Tianfei Dam, and directly to the north gate of Huaiyin City. The troops will depart on foot, advancing on two land routes. The southern route goes from Bengbu through Fengyang, Mingguang, Jiangba, and Gaoliangjian to Huaiyin. The northern route goes from Bengbu through Wuhe and Sixian to the Qiaosusu area. The Pacification Commissioner's Office here, as its troops are about to depart, has specially appointed Chief Liu Zhenhe of the Adjutant Office as the camp commander to inspect the barracks. Liu Zhun set off from Bengbu at 8:00 a.m. on the 11th, accompanied by more than ten people, including Adjutant Feng Mengrui of the 51st Army Headquarters, on a specially hired small steamer, and sailed along the Huai River to Huaiyin to arrange everything.</p>
<h3>Japanese Actively Extracting Gold Mines in Northeast China</h3>

<h3>The Story of the Reduced Collection of Land Value Tax in Beijing</h3>
<p>After Thorough Consideration According to Laws and Regulations; Lowest Tax Rate to Alleviate People's Hardships</p>
<p>Nanjing Correspondent: The municipal government held a Premier Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week ceremony for all staff at 8:00 a.m. yesterday, presided over by Secretary-General Wang Shufang. After leading the ceremony, he reported on the reduced collection of land value tax, saying that the tax rate was initially drafted by the municipal government in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and amendment by the Ministry of Interior, and then sent by the Executive Yuan to the Central Political Committee for detailed study by the Land Special Committee before a decision was made. Therefore, the land value tax rate in this city can be said to be the most legal and fair tax rate. As for the assessment of land prices, it was also based on the registered prices, reported prices, and various provisions of the Land Law by the Land Administration Bureau and the Land Valuation Committee, taking meticulous consideration to obtain an average price. The procedure was legal, and the valuation was fair. The reason why the municipal government is reducing the collection is not because the tax rate set in the past or the estimated land price may have flaws. It is due to the fact that the general public often takes a wait-and-see attitude towards new government taxes, regardless of whether they are reasonable or not. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the new tax and encourage people to pay actively, we decided to give a 10% discount for the first three years of the initial collection of land value tax, referring to the financial practice of giving preferential treatment to those who pay taxes on time. Secondly, since Nanjing became the capital, land prices have soared due to political reforms and the development of public utilities. However, since the outbreak of the national crisis, and influenced by the global economic downturn, the market has not been very prosperous. For example, Taiping Road is the most prosperous street in the city, but store closures are frequently heard. At the same time, it is not easy for landowners to rent out buildings after they have been built, or they have land but no funds to build. Therefore, in order to reduce the actual difficulties of the people, it was decided to temporarily collect land value tax at a 10% discount. As for why we decided to reduce it to 90%, and not 80% or 85%, it is because we still intend to comply with central government laws and regulations while considering the people's hardships. The Land Law stipulates that the minimum tax rate for construction land should be 10 per thousand of the land price. The original tax rate for construction land in this city was set at 14 per thousand. If collected at 90%, it would only be slightly above 12 per thousand. The right to give an 80% discount to owner-occupied land according to law would result in an actual collection of only slightly above 10 per thousand, with the tax rate only reaching 72% of the tax amount, which is only slightly above 10 per thousand. If reduced to 80% or 85%, it would be lower than the limit stipulated by the Land Law, which is illegal. The calculation of the various land taxes in this city after being collected at 90% is as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Construction land, collected at 14 per thousand of the land price of 1,000 yuan, and paid at a 90% discount, should pay a land value tax of 12 yuan and 60 cents. For the owner-occupied part, collected at 80% again, 1 yuan and 8 cents should be paid, actually only collecting at 72% of the tax amount, with the tax rate only slightly above 10 per thousand. ㊁ Agricultural land, collected at 10 per thousand of the land price of 1,000 yuan, and paid at a 90% discount, should pay a land value tax of 9 yuan. For the self-cultivated part, collected at 80% again, 7 yuan and 20 cents should be paid, with this tax rate only slightly above 7 per thousand. ㊂ Unimproved land, collected at 1.5 per thousand of the land price of 1,000 yuan, and paid at a 90% discount, should pay a land value tax of 22 yuan and 50 cents, with this tax rate only slightly above 22 per thousand. ㊃ Wasteland, collected at 40 per thousand of the land price of 1,000 yuan, and paid at a 90% discount, should pay a land value tax of 36 yuan, with the tax rate being 36 per thousand.</p>
<p>In addition, this city has a special situation, namely, restricted-use land and land through which roads pass, which cannot be taxed as ordinary land in order to be fair. Therefore, the previous municipal meeting specially proposed a discussion and decided on the following reduction and exemption measures: ㊀ Restricted-use land: if there are buildings that are still used as before, the agricultural land tax rate will be used to collect 10 per thousand of the land price of 1,000 yuan, and the land value tax of 9 yuan will be paid at a 90% discount, with the tax rate only being 9 per thousand. If it is temporarily used as agricultural land because it cannot be built due to restrictions, it will be collected at half the rate before the restriction is lifted, that is, each 1,000 yuan will pay 5 yuan, and a 90% discount will be given, with only 4 yuan and 50 cents being collected, and the tax rate only being 4.5 per thousand. If it cannot be used at all, the land value tax will be exempted before the original state is restored. ㊁ Land through which roads pass: (A) The part through which the road passes will be exempted if the people have already reduced the land for road use. (B) If there is a road passing through vacant land, the land that is not allowed to be built according to regulations, and is in the form of ruins because it cannot be used, will be exempted. (C) If there are already buildings on the land through which the road passes, it is considered to have been used to its full potential before being acquired. Even if it will be acquired in the future, there will be compensation for the land price and demolition costs, so there will be no loss. The land value tax will still be collected as usual.</p>
<p>In summary, the municipal government's reduction of the land value tax this time is reasonable and fair in every way. However, a small number of people are still getting an inch and wanting a mile, hoping to reduce it further. A few days ago, the mayor convened a tea party for local gentry to explain the reduced collection of land value tax this time. Some people even requested a further reduction and extended the reduced collection method to five years. In order not to violate laws and regulations, it is difficult to comply with this request. This city is the capital, and construction is heavy. If the people are too demanding in reducing the taxes they should pay, it will inevitably affect the progress of the capital's construction. The amount of reduction made by the municipal government this time has reached the point where it cannot be reduced any further. It is hoped that the citizens will deeply understand this purpose and actively pay, so as not to increase the government's difficulties in handling affairs. Moreover, the Central Political Committee has revised the penalty clauses for late payment of land value tax in the Land Law. According to the original penalty clauses of the Land Law, the penalties were too light. Although the government can auction the people's property if they fail to pay their taxes by the statutory deadline, it only levies a penalty of 5% annual interest in addition to deducting the taxes they should pay. In this way, cunning people can owe taxes for up to four years, deposit the taxes they should pay in the bank, and enjoy an annual interest of 8% to 10%, which will be used to offset the taxes they should pay in the future, and there will still be a surplus of 3% to 5% annual interest. Or, due to a lack of cash, borrowing from the bank requires bearing an interest rate of more than 10% per year. If the taxes they should pay are not paid and kept for their own use, it is equivalent to borrowing money from the government, bearing only a 5% annual interest rate. In view of this drawback, the Central Political Committee has specially changed the interest on arrears of taxes to 10% per year. In this way, cunning business owners will have nothing to gain. Therefore, it is hoped that all citizens will truly recognize that the municipal government's reduction of land value tax is purely to alleviate the people's hardships, and it is hoped that the colleagues of the municipal government will explain to the citizens at any time and place and persuade the people to pay actively, so as not to affect the progress of the capital's construction and give the people of the whole country a bad impression.</p>

<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Severe Plague Outbreak in Xiatangji Town</p>
<p>Xiatangji Town, located seventy li north of Hefei, is a wheat market in central Anhui. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people from various places go to the market to trade wheat. However, just as the wheat market season was approaching this year, a plague suddenly broke out in the town. In just a few days, over a hundred people have died, mostly children. Those infected die within six hours at most, their bodies turning black as if poisoned. Currently, the afflicted are flocking to the city and seeking treatment at the Christian Hospital. After treating them, the hospital does not allow them to be hospitalized to prevent infection. It also urgently telegraphed the Central Health Administration to request the dispatch of plague medicines and preventive measures, and it drew blood from the infected and sent it to the Health Administration for testing. The hospital and the county government, seeing that the plague is still spreading fiercely, dispatched Police Officer Li Songqiao from the county government and internal medicine physician Zheng Xinjian from the Christian Hospital to Xiatangji Town on the morning of the 10th to investigate the plague situation, so that they could report it to the provincial government and the Health Administration and find ways to contain it.

<p>Salt Production in Dayishan Salt River</p>
<p>In Guanyun County, the Dayishan Salt River has been abandoned since the Six Dams were abandoned. The amount of water in the Salt River rises and falls with the tide, and navigation also shifts with the tide, resulting in long-term siltation. The riverbed is more than two feet higher than the center of the river. Farmers along the tributaries in the western countryside collect river soil to make salt for consumption. In recent years, the water in the Salt River has been saltier than seawater. The soil is saturated with saltwater. The salt in the riverbed is evaporated by the sun, resulting in a lot of small salt appearing, making a white expanse along the banks. At night, the salt in the riverbed glows with golden light, which is quite a sight to see.</p>

<h3>Cotton Industry Trading Company Increases Capital</h3>
<p>Shareholders' Meeting Resolved Yesterday to Increase Capital from 2 Million to 10 Million</p>
<p>China Cotton Industry Trading Company engages in the business of raw cotton and yarn, etc., and has ginneries, etc., in the main locations of cotton-producing provinces across the country, purchasing large quantities of cotton and selling yarn, etc., on behalf of customers. Its business is exceptionally developed. Last year, with a bumper cotton harvest, the total amount of cotton sold reached over 13 million yuan, the yarn sold was about 5 million yuan, and other entrusted businesses amounted to about 3 million yuan, totaling over 20 million yuan. The original capital of 2 million yuan was insufficient, so it was decided to expand. A shareholders' meeting was held at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon at the company's office at No. 8 Gongguan Road to discuss the matter. Over forty shareholders attended, including Zhu Hanzhang, Bei Songsun, Hu Yun'an, Rong Zongjiao, Wang Lengbo, Yan Yutang, Zhang Yunchun, etc., representing four-fifths of the shares.

<h3>The Economic Situation at Home and Abroad in the 25th Year</h3>
<p>Memorandum from the International Trade Bureau to the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau, in its report on the domestic and international economic and trade situation for the entire year of last year, stated: "Respectfully submitted, this year marks the first year after the implementation of the new currency system in our country's foreign trade. Whether in terms of trade value or trade balance, there has been substantial progress. Calculated in national currency, exports have increased by 22% compared to the previous year, and imports have increased by 2% compared to the previous year. Due to the larger increase in export trade, the trade deficit has been sharply reduced by more than 10.07 million yuan compared to the previous year. The trade trend is gradually improving. In terms of commodities, the main exports of domestic products are tung oil, silk, egg products, metals, and raw and processed leather goods. Moreover, to meet overseas demand, the export volume this year has increased significantly compared to previous years. The main imports of foreign goods are hardware, machinery, chemical products, wheels, and various metal products. Among them, materials necessary for construction, such as hardware and wheels, have seen a significant increase in imports this year, which seems to be a sign of active economic construction in the country in recent years. In the future, as the situation of domestic unity becomes more consolidated, and the central authority is further expanded, there will be even more significant progress in finance. It is expected that the improvement of international trade will not be difficult. At the end of the year, we hereby submit a report on the trade situation for the entire year for your review. Respectfully submitted to Wu, Minister of Industry, by Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau."</p>
<p>Overview of the International Economy</p>
<p>The international economy in 1936 had entered a state of recovery. Since 1933, major trading countries had already made some economic progress. However, it was generally believed that this was a fragmented recovery from a long-term decline, rather than the overall prosperity of the entire world. However, 1936 can no longer be viewed in this way because the entire world has emerged from the depths of panic and entered a stage of rapid economic development. The United Kingdom, the British Commonwealth, the Scandinavian countries, and other countries with links to the gold pound had already embarked on the road to recovery after devaluing their currencies. Japan, the United States, and some raw material producing countries had also achieved economic recovery in 1933. During the period from 1934 to 1935, inventories in various countries gradually decreased, production was limited, and the weather cleared up without rain. Therefore, in 1936, world commodity prices generally and rapidly increased, and even raw material producing countries were able to restore their purchasing power. Moreover, the stability of exchange rates, the ease of finance, the increase in production, the reduction in unemployment, the rise in freight rates, and the recovery of shipping are even more evident. As for the devaluation of the French franc in September and the establishment of the tripartite monetary agreement between Britain, the United States, and France, they are even more helpful to the world's recovery. However, although the international economy this year can be viewed optimistically, the current structure of recovery is indeed due to the improvement and prosperity of various countries themselves. The volume of world trade is still 20% short of that in 1929, and the fiscal budgets of various countries are mostly unable to balance, and a large part of the national income must be used for non-productive military construction. This situation will easily lead to the recurrence of unbalanced economic conditions. Therefore, the important work of various countries in 1937 should be to expand the foundation of their own recovery, so that world trade can develop freely. And the prerequisite for this kind of work is the abandonment of economic nationalism and the elimination of political fears.</p>
<p>Overview of the Domestic Economy</p>
<p>This year, the domestic economy has gradually become prosperous. Although foreign aggression is frequent and the national crisis is pressing, the stability of the domestic political situation and the unification of government orders are the biggest factors in promoting economic improvement. This is because this year, there have been bumper harvests of agricultural products in various places, and the yields of various grains have shown a consistent upward trend. The purchasing power of rural areas has also increased, which is of great benefit to the activities of the national economy. The implementation of the new currency system policy before the year has stabilized finance, and industry and commerce are not as depressed as in the past. Therefore, the export of products has become active. Moreover, all parties in the government and the public are making every effort to promote economic construction. This year, the central government and local governments have focused on economic construction as the core of their governance. Therefore, the entire economy has a thriving appearance.</p>
<p>Optimism from Trade</p>
<p>Looking at this year's foreign trade, it is obviously more progressive than in previous years. Calculated in national currency, exports increased by 3%, and imports increased by 2%. Because the increase in export trade was larger, the trade deficit was sharply reduced by more than 10.07 million yuan. The trade trend is gradually improving, which is very gratifying. The reason for this is that export goods are easily promoted with the help of foreign exchange, and some commodities, such as tung oil, leather goods, and ore, are well suited to overseas demand. The imports of goods are due to the active domestic economic construction, and the demand for materials necessary for construction, such as vehicles and steel, is very high. Generally speaking, since the implementation of the new currency policy in November last year, the domestic economic situation has improved greatly. Therefore, the promotion of international trade is expected. In the future, the situation of domestic unity will become more consolidated, the central authority will be further expanded, and there will be even more significant progress in finance. Economic construction and the development of transportation are continuing and are in full swing. We hope that various countries will supply the materials necessary for construction. On the other hand, we hope that various countries will eliminate the shackles of international trade, improve preferential tariffs, import quotas, and exchange restrictions, so that our country's export trade will be unimpeded. Then, the international trade in the coming year will be even more prosperous.</p>

<h3>Spring Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are on the Market, and Silk Cocoon Merchants Begin to Purchase</h3>
<p>The United Committee of the Two Provinces Has Issued a Notice for Cocoon Collection Registration; Silk Factories in Various Places are Organizing Machines to Prepare for Work</p>
<p>After the National Economic Committee's Silk Improvement Committee stipulated the standard price for spring cocoons in the 26th year, the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang announced the handling of cocoon collection registration. Silk cocoon merchants have borrowed money from various banks and businesses to organize institutions to set out to purchase. The silk factories will start work after the new cocoons are on the market. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Two Provinces Announce Cocoon Collection Registration</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Committee issued a notice to solicit merchants to purchase spring cocoons within the province: "In accordance with the 'Provisional Measures for Managing Cocoon Collection during the Spring Season of the 16th Year' promulgated and implemented by the provincial government, all silk cocoon merchants from within and outside the province who wish to operate in various cocoon-producing areas within the province to collect improved cocoons and local cocoons must apply for registration with the Committee from today until 5:00 pm on May 18th. When registering, they must pay a guarantee deposit according to law (100 yuan per double stove for improved varieties, and 60 yuan per double stove for local varieties). This is hereby announced." The Jiangsu Provincial Silk Management Committee has also handled the management of silk cocoon merchants' cocoon collection.</p>
<p>Spring Cocoons Begin to Be on the Market This Year</p>
<p>This year's spring cocoons in Shaoxing, Yuyao, and other places in Zhejiang Province have already begun to be on the market. Haining, Jiaxing, Pinghu, and other places will also be on the market one after another. This year's spring cocoons in Wuxi, Liyang, and other places in Jiangsu Province are scheduled to be on the market around the 25th. Silk manufacturers and cocoon merchants from Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhejiang, and other places have borrowed money from various banks and money shops to organize cocoon collection agencies and begin to set out to purchase. As for the output of spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang this year, it is more than last year because the overseas silk market rose sharply last year, and farmers who raised silkworms were able to make a profit. Now, due to the large-scale hatching this year,</p>
<p>Silk Factories in Various Places Organize for Work</p>
<p>Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were forced to stop work one after another due to the depletion of raw materials. Taking Shanghai as an example, there are more than 50 in total. As of now, less than one-tenth have started work. Now, because the spring cocoons have begun to be on the market, they have all organized machines and are preparing to start work. As for workers' wages, starting this spring, it is planned to try out a production system, which will be implemented after achieving results. In addition, all silk reeling machines are old and no longer keep up with the new trend. Therefore, there are plans to transform them into new styles, namely the American-style vertical reeling machine. Several companies have already implemented the transformation.</p>
<h3>Participation in the Paris Exposition</h3>
<p>The Delegation Telegraphed Again, Requesting Central Government Support</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of our country's participation in the Paris Exposition, Ambassador Gu has now replied by telegram, stating that he has formally consulted with the French authorities and received special treatment. Therefore, the exhibitors hope that the delegation can depart on the French post office ship Aramis on the 29th of this month and arrive in Marseille, France on June 29th. The next morning, they will arrive in Paris and negotiate with the conference authorities. The Chinese delegation therefore telegraphed the central authorities again yesterday, requesting support. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "Chairman Wang of the Nanjing Central Political Committee, Acting President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, Vice Ministers Xu and Zou of the Ministry of Finance, Acting Secretary-General Wei, and Director He of the Political Affairs Office, please note: The case of participating in the Paris Exposition has been specifically approved by Chairman Chiang and approved by Vice President Kong. The Political Council has approved it and the government will provide subsidies. The committee originally intended to stop participating because of time constraints and the fear that the competition products could not be delivered before the deadline. After telegraphing Ambassador Gu, we received a reply stating that the matter had been formally discussed with the French authorities, and the association had been given special treatment, with two exhibition rooms allocated and construction and decoration underway. It is difficult to report that we are not participating. The competition products can be shipped to France at the end of June, etc. At the same time, all exhibitors have insisted that they still hope to participate immediately. I believe that this matter is of great importance, concerning international credibility. Now that it is difficult to stop, we can only proceed as before. The competition products emphasize quality rather than quantity, and are strictly selected. At the same time, we will take this opportunity to publicize the progress of our country's construction in recent years. We will work together to strive for international honor. We should ask your excellencies to check the previous case and continue to support it. We will immediately allocate funds to facilitate the process. We are extremely grateful. Li Shizeng, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, and Chu Minyi respectfully."</p>

<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Notifies Various Industries</h3>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in order to meet the needs of the business community, continued to run income tax study classes simultaneously in the North and South Cities. Yesterday, it notified various industry associations: "To Whom It May Concern, the 'Instructions on the Collection of the First, Second, and Third Types of Income Tax' have now been revised and promulgated by the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance.

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Instructions on Doubts about Sticking Stamps on Outgoing Goods Notification Slips</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce replied to Tongji Miscellaneous Grain Store yesterday: "In response to your letter dated the 11th of this month, with a paper attached for outgoing goods notification slip, asking whether it should be affixed with stamps, etc., the reply is as follows: ㊀ The association's reply regarding the outgoing goods slips used by the transportation company that should be affixed with stamps is based on the instructions of the Ministry of Finance's Taxation Office No. 7528 to this association on October 19, 24th year of the Republic. The bill of lading is used by the consignor or the consignor's trading partner to extract goods from the transportation company, while the transportation company's outgoing goods slip is used to collect the consigned goods from the consignor. Its effect is exactly opposite to the bill of lading. Therefore, it should be affixed with stamps according to the goods extraction slip in item 5. ㊁ The sample slip attached to your letter indicates that 'Please ask your friend to quickly bring the bill of lading to the warehouse to jointly weigh with a certain number. Do not delay. If there is a delay, the customer number will weigh by itself, which has nothing to do with our company.' Interpreting the meaning of the entire article, it is only urging them to jointly weigh within a certain period. There is no statement that goods can be extracted from the warehouse with this notification slip. If this statement cannot be considered a document for extracting goods, it is naturally not necessary to affix stamps according to law."</p>

Currently, in addition to the 400 yuan advanced for the Jianyan Society, 1,600 yuan should be deposited in the Postal Savings Bureau first. As for the association's expenses thereafter, the remaining cash will be used to maintain it for two and a half months first. All the insufficient amounts should be raised by the standing committee. ㊅ Regarding the case of the fund custody regulations, it was decided that because it was late, the regulations would be discussed and passed at the next meeting. Currently, Zhuang Dingxun, Liu Qinlin, Chi Yunfei, Lin Qingchi, and Zhu Lide were elected as temporary custody members, with Director Chi as the convener. The meeting adjourned at around 7:00 pm.</p>
<h3>It is Really Difficult to Add a Branch Market to the Shanghai Fish Market</h3>
<p>Improving Equipment is Progressing Step by Step</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Fish Market Council of the Ministry of Industry, in response to the request of the fish merchants, added a branch market at the 16th Pier. The main reason for this was the inconvenience of transportation to the fish market and the lack of perfect pier equipment. The Council discussed and agreed and submitted it to the Ministry for approval. Recently, another letter was received from the fish merchants, stating several opinions on improving the equipment of the existing market, but the matter of establishing a branch market was not mentioned. The reporter learned from the Council that it is really difficult to add a branch market, and the fish merchants seem to have abandoned their request. However, the improvement of equipment is always in the plan, such as facilitating transportation, expanding the pier, etc., even if the fish merchants do not express their opinions, it will be automatically carried out step by step. In the past, due to the occurrence of several capsized fishing boats, the fish merchants even complained about the market. However, in order to quell the situation, the Council compensated them. Therefore, the market's service to the merchants and the public has made them feel convenient and satisfied.</p>

Regarding the issue of the number of wages paid to workers under the contract system, it also requests an explanation. It is heard that most factories have now implemented the measures as ruled, so the labor unrest in the industry has gradually subsided.</p>

<h3>Disturbance on Nanjing Road Amidst British Coronation Celebrations</h3>
<p>Smashed Glass Windows of the Great World Company; Culprits Lightly Punished by the Court</p>
<p>To celebrate the coronation of the British monarch, the British military in Shanghai held a celebration ceremony at the Racecourse. The 10th was the day for rehearsals of various programs involving the British army and navy stationed in Shanghai, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and other participants in the celebration. The British expatriates and citizens who came to watch filled the venue shoulder to shoulder. The evening before was the start of the formal celebrations. The Racecourse and its surroundings were packed with people. Moreover, all British-owned companies and shops decorated their doors and rooftops with lights. At dusk, all the electric lights were turned on, resembling a city that never sleeps, a spectacle unprecedented in scale. The Public Concession Police Department, to maintain order, pre-selected capable Chinese, Western, Japanese, and Indian detectives from its affiliated police stations to cooperate with the detectives from the Central, Old Zhabei, and New Zhabei police stations, patrolling the Bund, Nanjing Road, Yu Qiaqing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Ma Houchao Road. The hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues located around the Racecourse had all their rooms reserved in advance. These establishments, due to their proximity to the performance venue, saw an opportunity to hoard, temporarily increasing their prices, thus tripling their profits. Around 8 PM the night before, the balconies and rooftops of these establishments facing the road were filled with figures, and the road was constantly bustling with pedestrians. Only trams and buses were allowed to operate as usual on Nanjing Road, Yu Qiaqing Road, and Jing'an Temple Road near the Racecourse. Other vehicles were not allowed to cross this boundary. After 8 PM, the number of tourists increased, leaving no space to stand. As a result, some frivolous individuals took the opportunity to harass young women in the crowd, causing some women to have their clothes torn and lose their hairpins. The area in front of the Great World Company was the most crowded. Those watching from the balconies witnessed these acts of mischief and poured water on the crowd. To vent their anger, those who were splashed threw bricks and stones at the company, damaging three large window panes, with losses estimated at 750 yuan. The company's staff, along with detectives, arrested six stone-throwers. Thirteen others were also arrested on suspicion of causing trouble, eleven of whom had minor head injuries. Unexpectedly, a fire alarm suddenly went off at the New World Company. By the time the fire brigade arrived, the fire had been extinguished, adding to the commotion. Yesterday morning, the police sent the nineteen arrested individuals to the First Special District Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu, representing the police, charged them under Articles 354 and 150 of the criminal code, describing the chaotic situation at the time. After questioning by Judge Pan, Wang Wan'de and Min Chatao were sentenced to 20 days of detention each, and Ju Wanggen, Shen Fuxiang, Lu Meixin, and Xu Rongfu were sentenced to 15 days of detention each. The remaining thirteen, including Guo Ruiren, were acquitted.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Native Association Sends Funds to Support Suiyuan</h3>
<p>The Wuxi Native Association in Shanghai launched a fundraising campaign among fellow natives to support the arduous battle in Suiyuan. They have now collected a substantial amount and received donations totaling 559 yuan and 23 cents. This amount has been handed over to the Bank of China to be remitted to General Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of Suiyuan Province, for distribution to the front lines to provide support. The association's telegram to General Fu Zuoyi is as follows: "General Fu Zuoyi of Suiyuan, admired for your loyalty and deeply revered. Since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, the entire nation has been filled with anguish. Under the guidance of the central government, you have demonstrated patriotism and fought against the enemy with courage, achieving victories everywhere. A natural hero, you are a pillar of the nation. We, the Wuxi natives residing in Shanghai, look to the frontier with deep concern. Fortunately, you are guarding the Great Wall and defending the country, and we hope that the invaders will be quickly eliminated for the good of the nation and its people. We have raised 559 yuan and 23 cents in national currency, which we are remitting to your headquarters through the Bank of China to express our sincere support and boost the morale of the soldiers. This small amount is insignificant, but it represents the hard work and blood of the people. We hope you will accept it and provide a receipt. Respectfully, the Wuxi Native Association of Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Attempted River Rescue Ends in Double Drowning</h3>
<p>Near the Yichang Road bridge in the Suzhou Creek, there are many makeshift shelters. At 5 AM the day before, Chen Kaiju, a resident of one of the shelters, went to the pier to draw water but lost his balance and fell into the river. A neighbor, Chen Xiaowuzi, witnessed this and immediately jumped into the water to help. However, both of them were not good swimmers and drowned almost instantly. Their families discovered the incident and began searching. It was not until 7 PM that evening that Chen Kaiju's body was recovered, while Xiaowuzi's body was still missing. Yesterday, Li Wenqi, a detective from the water patrol police station, took the deceased's body and his wife, Ms. Chen, to the local court for an official autopsy. The body was then handed over to the wife for burial. It is reported that the deceased was 31 years old, from Yancheng, and worked in a Japanese yarn factory there.</p>
<h3>Seducing Another Man's Wife and Then Committing Arson</h3>
<p>Wang Tongmao is Despicable</p>
<p>Xu Tianshou, a 34-year-old laborer from Huai'an, lived in a thatched house at No. 76 South of the Ice Factory Field on Dongchang Road, Pudong. His wife, Ms. Yu, was 33 years old. Due to her weak will, she was seduced into adultery by Wang Tongmao, a fellow townsman who lived in a thatched house at No. 95 in the new settlement. They secretly met from time to time, unbeknownst to Xu. On the morning of February 23 of this year, Xu got up early for work and went out. Not long after leaving, he returned home to put on warmer clothes because of the cold. He suddenly saw Wang and his wife sleeping together. Overcome with jealousy, he was about to confront Wang when Wang jumped up, beat Xu severely, and left. Several days later, Wang took the opportunity to lure Ms. Yu to a small inn in Puxi, where they lived together for half a month. Ms. Yu, thinking of her husband's kindness, deeply regretted her past mistakes and seized an opportunity to escape back to her home in Pudong. Wang, seeing that she had left, secretly plotted revenge. Around 8 PM the night before, he carried a paper roll and two boxes of matches and sneaked to the outside of Xu's house to set it on fire. He was caught in the act by Xu, who called the police and had him arrested at the Pudong Branch Bureau. According to the plaintiff couple, Wang seduced and had an affair and then set fire to their house. In his defense, Wang claimed that he was asking the plaintiff for three cents in gambling debts, which he refused to pay, falsely accusing him of seduction and arson. The bureau chief, believing that three cents of gambling debt would not lead to accusations of adultery and arson, concluded that the defendant was lying. He ordered the case to be sent to the local court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Xi Rao Jia Cuo Promotes Sino-Tibetan Buddhist Understanding</h3>
<p>Since responding to the invitation from local Buddhist groups in Shanghai, Xi Rao Jia Cuo, the great Geshe of Tibet, has been lecturing on Buddhism at the Jueyuan Pure Karma Society on Hart Road starting from the 10th of this month. Here is a follow-up report on the situation: ㊀ Since Xi Rao Jia Cuo began lecturing on Buddhism on the 10th, he continued to speak on the three essentials of the path yesterday. He will finish lecturing on the 15th, transmit the refuge vows on the 16th, and bestow the long-life empowerment on the 17th, which is a Tibetan custom of baptism said to dispel misfortune. After the lectures are completed, it is undecided whether he will visit Mount Putuo and other mountains to visit temples or return to Beijing, according to Xi's secretary, Zhang Zhifu. ㊁ It is also learned that the Bodhi Society in Shanghai has a translation center in Longhua dedicated to translating Tibetan scriptures. However, without scholars who have extensively studied Tibetan classics and are proficient in both exoteric and esoteric teachings to lead the work, it will be difficult to fully explore their depths. Therefore, the society has obtained Xi's consent to oversee the translation and organization work, thereby promoting Sino-Tibetan Buddhist understanding.</p>

<h3>Mother-in-Law Flees with Daughter; Son-in-Law Sues for Interference with Family</h3>
<p>Case Transferred to the Second Special Court Due to Jurisdictional Error; Mother-in-Law Accuses Zhou Zibin of Seduction</p>
<p>Huang Guifang, also known as Zhu Huangshi, a 36-year-old woman from Zhenjiang, was originally married to Zhu Yinfu. After their divorce, she had a daughter named Zhu Aying, now 17 years old. In June of last year, through the introduction of Dong Jiu'an, a man from Hangzhou, Aying became engaged to Wang Guangde (23 years old), a native of Zhenjiang and partner in the Guangyisheng Chinese medicine store on Wuzhou Road. They were married on November 11 and lived together at No. 74 Mintiniyin Road Village in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, Zhu Yinfu, Huang Guifang's ex-husband, intervened and dragged Huang to the Wenmiao Road Police Station, which then transferred her to the local court. Because the matter concerned a dispute over marriage rights and did not involve criminal matters, the court ruled that it would not accept the case. After mediation, Wang Guangde paid Zhu Yinfu 30 yuan as compensation, settling the matter. From then on, Wang and Aying had a very harmonious relationship, and Huang Guifang lived with her son-in-law. However, recently, Huang and her daughter often went out, and now they have become even more brazen, often not returning all night. After Wang slightly admonished them, Huang and Aying took their clothes and disappeared on the 27th of last month. Wang reported the matter to the French police for investigation, but they have not been found. Wang then hired lawyer Fan Ming to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court against Huang for interference with family, requesting that she be punished under Article 240, Paragraph 3, and Article 320, Paragraph 1, of the criminal code, and that she be ordered to return his daughter and the stolen clothing. Yesterday, the criminal division chief of the court, Qian Hongye, held a hearing on the case. Because the residences of both the plaintiff and defendant, the place of marriage, and the location of the crime were all within the jurisdiction of the Second Special Court, the court ruled that the case should be filed with the Second Special Court. Lawyer Fan requested that the case be transferred, and Judge Qian agreed to transfer the case to the Second Special Court for trial due to jurisdictional error. Recently, Huang Guifang also filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court against Zhou Zibin, father of Zhou Jiaqi of the Guangyisheng Chinese medicine store, accusing him of seduction and abandonment, claiming that Zhou had seduced her to the Great China Hotel and had sexual relations with her. She also claimed that they lived together at No. 2 Xianglin Lane on Qiujiang Road, No. 304 Wangzhi Road, and No. 6 Tongchang Lane on Haining Road. At the same time, she pointed out that Wang Guangde was Zhou Zibin's son, Zhou Zhengming. This case was also heard yesterday by Judge Feng of the Special Court. Zhou Zibin absolutely denied having any relationship with Huang and claimed that Wang Guangde was not his son, nor was he named Zhou, but only a disciple. Because the case still required investigation, the court ordered it to be rescheduled for another hearing. Departure, inspection locations: ㊀ Shashi, ㊁ Yichang, ㊂ Wanxian, ㊃ Chongqing, ㊄ Chengdu. Take a steamer directly to Chongqing from this city, then take a highway bus to Chengdu. After completing the task, take a highway bus back to Chongqing, then transfer to a steamer to Wanxian, Yichang, and Shashi before returning to Shanghai. Inspection Tasks: ㊀ Investigate and compare the sales volume of national goods and foreign goods in various ports along the Yangtze River in recent years, the dynamics of national goods sales in each port, the situation of national goods factories and organizations in various regions, the psychology and preferences of local men and women towards national goods, and their evaluations after using various products. Conduct separate discussions among various classes to obtain genuine opinions and attitudes for the reference of national goods factories. ㊁ Promote the current state of production in various national goods factories in Shanghai and the progress made in their products in recent years. Provide detailed reports on the progress of the national goods movement in Shanghai so that each port can learn from them and know what to emulate. ㊂ Establish close contact with local officials, industry and commerce education institutions, women's groups, and organizations that promote national goods in each place to prepare for continuous communication in the future and to work together to promote the national goods movement further. ㊃ Promote the future plans of the joint national goods company and encourage enthusiastic national goods advocates and leaders in industry and commerce to organize the following practical businesses in their respective regions: national goods companies, national goods factories, joint business offices, national goods introduction centers, national goods promotion centers, and native product and national goods exchange centers. ㊁ Advocate or use national goods organizations, such as women's national goods use associations, etc., and bring together national goods factories to engage in production and sales cooperation and effectively connect local products with manufactured products to expand trade between provinces.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry's Commodity Inspection Bureau to Reorganize into Animal Epidemic Prevention Institute</h3>
<p>Approved to Take Effect on July 1st</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Industry's Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, starting from July of the second year, the Shanghai Blood Serum Manufacturing Year will be renamed the "Animal Epidemic Prevention Institute jointly operated by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry's Agricultural Experimental Institute." The institute engages in research on war epidemic prevention and treatment of livestock in various regions, earning the trust of society. It has repeatedly designed and guided livestock conservation projects for provinces such as Sichuan and Guangdong and established animal epidemic prevention experimental zones in Taixing and Dongyang. It has achieved considerable results in animal epidemic prevention. Later, it was ordered to merge the institute into the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department of the Central Agricultural Institute and to change the prevention institute into an epidemic prevention experimental zone. After repeated consultations, the bureau and the institute decided to reorganize the jointly operated Shanghai Animal Epidemic Prevention Institute on July 1st of this year, incorporating the existing equipment for blood serum manufacturing and technical personnel into the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department of the Experimental Institute. However, due to the highly developed dairy industry in Shanghai and the fact that most dairy cows nationwide are purchased from this region, the presence or absence of diseases in dairy cows is extremely important to the safety of edible milk and public health. The institute felt that the livestock protection business in Shanghai was of great importance to the health of the population. Therefore, it proposed to rename the Shanghai Animal Epidemic Prevention Institute as the Livestock Improvement Institute after the merger, to be managed by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, specializing in livestock improvement matters in Shanghai. This plan is scheduled to take effect on July 1, 1937. The bureau and institute jointly submitted it to the Ministry of Industry for review and approval in February and received approval on March 6. The original director of the Prevention Institute, Cheng Zhaojiong, also resigned from his concurrent position and was transferred back to the Agricultural Experimental Institute to serve as the director of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department, with Chen Yingding taking over the vacant position.</p>

It was resolved to send a letter of thanks to the Public Works Department. 3. It was resolved to send a letter to the Municipal Association to review the policy of collecting monthly donations from both district branches and taxpayers, as the Municipal Association's expenses are funded by monthly donations from district branches. 4.

<h3>Seamen's Party Department Promotes Seamen's Patriotism</h3>

Each department of seamen was ordered to bring their families to watch. More than 1,000 people attended. Before the film screening, Director Liu Huogong of the department gave a brief speech, stating, "The purpose of inviting you here today is to watch movies, which is a form of entertainment. Generally speaking, the department, standing in the position of leading the masses, should only encourage the masses to work hard, endure hardship, and save the country during this time of national crisis. How can we lead you in entertainment? You should know that the motivation for this film screening is not to promote entertainment, but to encourage seamen to love their country and their race. The screening of 'The Xi'an Incident' is to let everyone know the truth that our highest leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, remained calm and composed even in a desperate situation. That kind of fearless spirit can't help but make those who watch it feel respect and increase their enthusiasm for supporting the leader. The screening of 'Autumn Exercise' is to let everyone know that our country's army is an army with principles, organization, and discipline. Everyone only knows about the country and doesn't know about themselves. They are not only charging forward, but even if they are going through fire and water, they are not afraid. We should emulate their martial spirit and strive for the country and the nation." The audience was deeply moved. The films ended at around 10 PM, and the audience dispersed.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Pays Attention to Wharf Petty Theft</h3>
<p>Cooperating with the French Public Works Department to Rectify</p>
<p>Regarding the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's replacement of the Jin Shengyuan Wharf patrol, the person in charge of the company stated: "The Jin Liyuan Wharf is the only important wooden wharf of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. This wharf is the one used by the Bureau's ships for berthing, so passengers and goods from all over the Yangtze River and the North and South Seas are concentrated here. Its business development is also the best among all the wharves in this port. However, many petty thieves are always lurking in the area, making it impossible to maintain order, thus forming a special area for them to hide. As a result, cases of theft of passengers and goods occur almost every day. Even after goods are lost, if the cargo owner can pay a small fee, the lost items can be recovered. There are also those who deliberately damage goods and take the opportunity to steal them. The Bureau, in view of this, and in order to rectify the situation, held an examination for the wharf patrol in March of this year, eliminating them once and then training them, in order to encourage those who are retained to work diligently. The intention cannot be said to be unkind. However, the results have been minimal in the past month, indicating that the patrol officers retained after this screening are not working effectively and are also suspected of favoritism and indulgence. The Bureau deeply feels that if there is no thorough rectification, the theft trend will not be slightly reduced. Not only will it be impossible to face the merchants and the society, but also the country's capital will not be guaranteed. Therefore, it is determined to dismiss all the old patrol officers of the wharf in order to innovate. However, because the area is located in the French Concession, according to past practice, the national police can only exercise their functions on the river surface, while the land police power in the French Concession is controlled by the French Public Works Department. Therefore, the reorganization of the wharf can only be thoroughly accomplished through cooperation between the two sides. The French Concession authorities cannot effectively maintain the local security of the area without this cooperation. It is heard that the Bureau has conducted detailed research with the French Public Works Department, agreed on cooperation methods, and decided to adopt the petition police system. On the one hand, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will select and hire the patrol officers, and on the other hand, it will instruct them to register with the Public Works Department as petition police, directly directing and supervising them. It is also heard that the former patrol officers handed over their firearms and uniforms separately the day before yesterday."</p>

<h3>Husband and Wife Agree to Divorce, Mutually Wishing Each Other a Bright Future</h3>
<p>The Wife Even Wanted to Invite Her Husband for Lunch, But Due to Other Engagements, They Shook Hands and Parted Ways</p>
<p>Huang Linqi, a native of Shaoxing, is 33 years old and currently resides at No. 60, Lane 142, Tangshan Road, Hongkou. His wife, Shen Wenying, is 22 years old and resides at No. 46, Sazhu Lane, North Big Dipper. The couple has been married for four years, but less than four months after their wedding, Huang Linqi was implicated in a drug case and sentenced to four years in prison. However, after serving less than three years, he was released on parole last November. Due to the couple's limited time together and frequent separations, their opinions diverged, and they each had their own concerns, making it difficult to reconcile. They were able to reach an agreement to divorce on their own. Since only one lawyer could provide proof, and the law required proof from at least two people for it to be valid, they decided that Shen Wenying would file a divorce petition with the local court. Yesterday, both parties appeared in court. Without questioning the reasons, they both stated that they had already agreed to divorce outside of court and had come to the court to ask for proof. The court then made a record of the divorce in court, which both parties signed before leaving. Afterwards, Shen Wenying even invited Huang Linqi to lunch as a final farewell. However, Huang had other business with his lawyer, so they shook hands, wished each other a bright future, and parted ways. It is truly one of the most beautiful chapters in the history of divorce.</p>

<h3>A Boy Fell to His Death After a Balcony Railing Broke</h3>
<p>The Court Conducted a Postmortem Examination Yesterday</p>

On the 11th (the day before yesterday) at 4:00 PM, his elder son, Shuxing, went alone to the house of his fellow villager Fang Wang, at No. 102 Minzou, to play with Wang's nine-year-old daughter, Fang Yuexian. At 5:15 PM, the two children went to the balcony to play. Dong Shuxing hung from the wooden railing of the balcony and swung like on a swing. Unexpectedly, the railing, due to years of disrepair and corrosion, broke off, causing Shuxing to fall from a height onto the cement ground in Chengyu Lane. He suffered head injuries, and blood flowed from his ears and nose, causing him to lose consciousness instantly. Fang Yuexian ran to tell her mother, who reported it to the French police. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but died at 7:00 PM due to the severity of his injuries. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home. Yesterday, Dong Qiming, a prosecutor from the Second Special Court, and a forensic doctor examined the body and confirmed that the death was caused by a fall. The body was claimed by his mother, Dong Zhao.</p>

<p>Yan Ruijing, a 22-year-old station police officer from Huai'an, Jiangsu, stationed at the intersection of Gonghe Xin Road and Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, met a woman, Wang Chen, 34, from Tongzhou, on the morning of the day before yesterday at 10:00 AM while on duty. Wang was lost while looking for her younger sisters who came to Shanghai from Fenghua Creek. Seeing that the woman could be deceived, Yan pretended to help her find her group and tricked Chen into going to Room 9 on the upper floor of the Shangbao Hotel at No. 1478, West Datong Road, Zhongdian Road, where he raped her. Chen paid four jiao for the room. The policeman used the alias Yin Zixia and Chen used the name Yin Zhishi, posing as husband and wife.

<h3>The Person Who Sent the Plaque on Behalf of Chairman Lin is Sentenced to Six Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Convicted of Forgery</p>
<p>Qu Jinshan, a native of Jiangbei who lived on Rihui Bridge, Shanghai South, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the local court for suspected murder.

The Chen family reported the incident to the land guard, who reported it to the local court at about 4:00 PM. Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang and clerk Yuan Jingdao, along with police officers, arrived at the scene to examine the body and confirmed that the death was caused by drowning before death. The death report was filled out and the body was handed over to her son, Lu Guoliang, for coffin burial.</p>

<h3>Gao Yunhe Assaulted Due to Gambling Dispute</h3>
<p>Six Assailants Arrested</p>
<p>At No. 17 Renchang Lane, Qiwupu Road, a man named Zhou Changde from Anhui recently gathered a crowd to gamble on Pai Gow. At 11:50 PM the night before last, a man from Ningbo named Gao Yunhe joined the game and had a dispute with the dealer after losing. He left angrily. Zhou Changde, fearing that he would report them, had more than ten of his fellow villagers, including Liu Jinxian, Mei Defu, Chen Guozhong, Wang Akang, Pan Longhai, and Wu Shuzhi, follow him. They surrounded Gao at the entrance of Renchang Lane and beat him to the ground with benches and other weapons, without asking any questions, before fleeing into No. 68 and No. 70 in the lane and hiding upstairs to observe the situation. Gao Yunhe was seriously injured and barely breathing. Chinese constable No. 2970 and two Western constables, No. 250 and No. 276, who were on duty nearby, heard the alarm and arrived. They were unable to arrest the assailants, so they hired a car to take the injured man to the Shanghai East Hospital for treatment. Later, Gao Yunhe's companion, Xie Linzhang from Taixing, found out where Liu Jinxian and the other five were hiding and notified the Chinese and Western constables, who arrested them at their addresses and took them to the Yulin Road Police Station. Zhou Changde, who was arrested on the 17th, had already escaped without a trace, and the gambling equipment could not be found. This morning, Liu Jinxian and his gang were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and requested a postponement. The defendants' statements were evasive and they all denied injuring Gao. Judge Xiao ordered them to be returned to custody pending the victim's recovery for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Grand View Garden Model Exhibition</h3>
<p>Starting Yesterday at the Great New Company</p>
<p>The novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" is widely popular. Its narration and romance are excellent, and its depiction of gardens, pavilions, winding corridors is also fascinating. It is not only a marvel of fiction, but also an excellent reference material for studying the old-style architecture and garden structure of our country. The Grand View Garden panoramic model made by Yunfen Layman is on display. Each flower, stone, couplet, area, and window sill is based on the "Dream of the Red Chamber." The entire garden, ponds, and pavilions are made of silk and brocade, shining and pleasing to the eye. The stories are interspersed and the characters are arranged, such as Xiangyun sleeping on a stone, Daiyu burying flowers, and Granny Liu getting drunk in Yihongyuan, etc., all lifelike. It is truly a treasure of art. It was previously exhibited publicly in Tianjin to raise money for flood relief in the Yellow River and was a great event at the time. Last year, when Ms. Yang Lingfu held a calligraphy exhibition at the Young Women's Christian Association in this city, she also displayed the Yunfen Layman Grand View Garden model. However, it was only for three days, and there were still many people in the city who had not seen it. At the urging of acquaintances, it is now being exhibited again from the 12th of this month on the fourth floor of the Great New Company on Nanjing Road. A small fee will be charged to maintain the venue. It is expected to be a lively event.</p>
<h3>Fan Keling Invites Dr. Zhang Fayao</h3>
<p>To Cooperate in a Law Firm, But Zhang Has Not Yet Agreed</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Fayao, the eldest son of Zhang Xiaolin, returned to China after receiving a doctorate in law and economics from the University of Paris, France, two years ago. Although he has been invited by important figures in the political and academic circles several times, he has politely declined them all. The doctor does not want to enter politics and has always aspired to develop the industrial and financial sectors. In recent years, he has held important positions in several major banks in Shanghai. It is heard that Mr. Fan Keling, the newly elected American director of the British Municipal Council, has repeatedly requested to cooperate with him in a law firm, but has not yet obtained the doctor's consent. If it can be realized, several famous lawyers will follow suit. With Dr. Zhang's personality, knowledge, and experience, he will definitely add a famous lawyer to Shanghai to protect legal rights and uphold justice in the future.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Huang Jue Indicted for Issuing Bad Checks</h3>
<p>Dispute over Club Funds with His Secretary; Repeated Absences Led to Arrest</p>
<p>Huang Jue, a 50-year-old lawyer from Suzhou, formerly practiced law in this city, with an office on the upper floor of the Silk Industry Bank on Sanma Road. In the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), he gave his secretary, Shen Baoyi, a check for 260 yuan in payment of club fees. When the check bounced, Shen, after fruitless negotiations, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Third Court, accusing Huang Jue of fraud by issuing a bad check. Huang failed to appear in court. Meanwhile, they reached a settlement out of court, with Huang paying 50 yuan in cash and issuing another check for the remaining 210 yuan, with a specified date for cashing. Shen then withdrew his suit. Later, Shen Baoyi again filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing Huang Jue of forging documents, claiming that the money from the previous case had been repaid through Zhu Jingqing, but Huang had used a blank sheet of paper bearing his signature to write a document withdrawing the previous fraud suit and submitting it to the court. Shen requested a trial. The court accepted the complaint and summoned Huang, but he had already left Shanghai and could not be reached. The case was suspended for over three years. Shen Baoyi eventually discovered that Huang was practicing law in Suzhou, with an office on the second floor of the Guohuo Company in the North Bureau of Suzhou. Last month, Shen petitioned the Special Second Court to summon Huang. The court entrusted the Wu County District Court to serve the summons. Huang failed to appear. The Special Second Court then instructed the Wu County District Court to arrest Huang and hold him on bail. Yesterday, Chen Shuoying of the Special Second Court presided over the trial. The plaintiff, Shen Baoyi, stated that in the previous case of fraud by issuing a bad check, mediated by Yun Lu, Huang had first paid 50 yuan and issued another check, agreeing to complete the formalities by May 15th and have Shen withdraw the suit on the 16th. Unexpectedly, Huang did not complete the formalities but instead used a blank sheet of paper with Shen's signature from a previous case to write a document on Shen's behalf, unilaterally submitting it to the court to withdraw the suit. Shen learned of this and filed a complaint for forgery. The defendant, Huang Jue, accompanied by his defense lawyer, appeared in court and denied the forgery. He claimed that after the mediation in the previous case, the plaintiff had written the draft of the withdrawal statement himself, which his secretary had copied. He didn't know who had delivered it to the court and presented a draft of the plaintiff's statement to the court. Shen denied writing the draft, saying that Huang had written it at the time, and he had modified it. The judge ordered Shen to write numbers in court to compare the handwriting. The judge then informed Huang that his challenge to jurisdiction was denied, as the investigation had determined that the crime had occurred within the court's jurisdiction, and therefore it could accept the case. At this point, the court determined that the facts were clear, ordered closing arguments, and announced that the verdict would be delivered at 2:00 PM on the 15th. The defendant posted a 1,000-yuan bond. The actual defense lawyer was instructed to submit a supplementary bail application the following day.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>"Bride Schools"</h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>Ms. Okada Tokuko, a famous fashion design instructor from Tokyo, Japan, arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru a few days ago. She plans to set up a "Bride School" similar to those in Japan. It is said that the address has been chosen at the Household Handicraft Association on North Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>It is said that "Bride Schools" are very common in Japan. The courses taught are nothing more than common knowledge about raising newborns, cooking and tailoring methods, and the arrangement of seasonal flowers. These subjects are better described as "common knowledge for housewives" rather than "common knowledge for brides." Japanese women are called 'the most virtuous women,' perhaps because they have been educated in "Bride Schools" and have gained a great reputation?</p>
<p>Not long ago, a commentary reporter from the women's section of the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun and Kiyoko Ishihara, a reporter from the Toyo Keizai Shimbun, held a Sino-Japanese women's forum hosted by the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge. In her speech, she said, "China, in my eyes, is much more advanced than the China I imagined. In particular, Chinese women have equal status with men in politics." Although this is a remark that every "foreign guest" who comes to China can tactfully use, since the May Fourth Movement, many Chinese women have indeed been released from the kitchen and are doing practical work. However, it seems impossible to infer from this what the actual status of Chinese women is at home or internationally. The three-inch golden lotus is praised abroad, the "ideal partner" is finally found in China, and now Okada Tokuko is coming to Shanghai to set up a "Bride School." This is precisely "we are like fish in muddy water, living in a daze, inexplicable."</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the so-called "Bride School." Judging from the above-mentioned subjects, most women in our country can understand these "common knowledge for brides," and it is also the "inherent virtue" of Chinese women. Why bother Ms. Okada Tokuko to preach in the Eastern style? I think Ms. Okada Tokuko will see this situation as soon as she unpacks and regret this trip? But she is fortunate to have come to Shanghai. Shanghai has a group of women who are somewhere between the "equal status with men in politics" mentioned by Ishihara Kiyoko and the "common knowledge that a bride should have" that Okada Tokuko wants to preach. They really need a "Bride School" to learn some authentic "common knowledge that a bride should have," such as the design of wedding dresses, the study of wedding marches, makeup techniques, and everything else, with styles that strive to be beautiful and attitudes that are generous; and Ms. Okada Tokuko is originally a famous "fashion design instructor." If she can change her original intention and adapt to the trend, the "Bride School" may not be able to produce many talents and make a lot of money; at the same time, the Shanghai bride is also very fortunate.</p>
<p>However, what kind of "impression of Chinese brides" she will publish after returning home is not within the scope of this article.</p>
<h3>Joining the Fun</h3>
<p>— Hua Cun</p>
<p>After talking about "watching the fun," I feel that it is necessary to talk about "joining the fun."</p>
<p>There are people who are addicted to watching the fun, and at the same time, there are people who make a living by joining in the fun. The former does nothing, while the latter does something.</p>
<p>People who like to join in the fun always have a smiling face, are enthusiastic and generous, like the Buddha Han Shi. At some celebrity banquets and gatherings with "Sun Yat-sen's portrait" hanging, we can always see these smiling faces, but sometimes they are also nervously serious, swaying around like flies.</p>
<p>As soon as an important person steps down, they launch a farewell party to show their attachment. In the farewell speech, they express their gratitude and tears, saying that with his departure, what will happen to the people! But the next day, as soon as another important person takes office, they call on their friends and relatives, holding flags, and swaggering to the dock to welcome them. And they also want to hold a tea party, desperately applauding the new noble, saying that with your arrival, it is the blessing of the people, really like rain after a long drought, nothing could be better! While saying goodbye, while welcoming, they are always so busy.</p>
<p>In addition, they follow the will of heaven, or are passionately indignant, and hold a meeting to denounce rebellion: or they are encouraged and joyful, and send a telegram of support. They inquire about how old a certain important person is this year, and they are old and virtuous, so they should launch a birthday celebration; a certain celebrity has been married to his wife for several years, and fortunately the concubines are full of the room, but the virtuous wife has not yet been divorced, so they rush up to participate in the silver or golden wedding anniversary.</p>
<p>However, these are all high-level. Those of a medium level go to the newspapers to write articles, praising virtues: they act as receptionists at meetings, wearing a silk flower on their lapel, rushing around in the crowd, sweating profusely. Seeing their peers, they smile, wipe their sweat, and frown, observing their expressions, as if there is resentment, but in fact it is triumph.</p>
<p>For events like the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor, these gentlemen have no "official duties," so they squeeze into the ranks of the foreigners, respectfully and admiringly sitting there as "high-class Chinese" to participate in the grand event!</p>
<p>They are always busy, the host is busy, they help, joining in the fun: the host is idle, they talk nonsense, acting as guests. The official Ximen in "Jin Ping Mei" is always surrounded by this kind of sensible character.</p>
<p>When Yingying marries, Hongniang is busy. Because whipping to peers and joining in the fun for the host are the virtues of slaves—this has a nice name, called "adding to the fun."</p>
<p>With these kinds of Chinese descendants who are good at "adding to the fun," the world is peaceful and the Republic of China lives forever!</p>
<h3>Creepers on Mount Tai</h3>
<p>— Ma Feng</p>
<p>"Sir, don't lean back. You think this makes it easier for us to walk, but—it doesn't give us any strength!"</p>
<p>Sitting on the mountain sedan chair coming down from the South Heavenly Gate, looking at the high blue sky and the deep valley-like stone steps, I couldn't help but feel panic in my heart. --This is really not a game. Dangerous! Looking at the two "creepers" walking down the stone steps in a row, gliding down very easily, my heart shrank even more—if they slipped, then…. Uncomfortably sitting on the mountain sedan chair, these bad thoughts revolved in my mind.</p>
<p>"Sir, don't worry! You don't know: you can't go down the mountain any other way! Stepping on the stones and sliding down step by step, it is natural and not tiring at all!"</p>
<p>Although I was still afraid in my heart; I couldn't say anything more. I knew that they had some taboos about these things. Turning my face to look at the South Heavenly Gate, which seemed to be located in the clouds, I felt the sedan chair shaking -- the shadow of the South Heavenly Gate was gone! It turned a full circle. It turned out that the two creepers were "changing shoulders," and my heart couldn't help but thump again. Rubbing my eyes, seeing their calm expressions, I lightly exhaled—</p>
<p>"Oh! That scared me to death!"</p>
<p>"Sir, don't worry, we are 'creepers' who make a living by relying on the mountain! In previous years, except for not going up the mountain in winter, we really went up and down thirty or forty times a month! Business was extremely good! Everyone could have food, drink, and use, and also support a large family! Now...now...the money we earn is really a handful of crumbs. The years are bad, who has the money to spend on coming to the mountain? What can we do? Now our business has been taken away by the railway hotel! For example, every year foreigners come to visit the mountain, we can make two more, but they set the price: the same day round trip, three yuan! One yuan has to be deducted from them from this three yuan..."</p>
<p>As they were talking, we had already arrived at Yunbu Bridge. The stone bridge under the bridge and the section of road to Zhongtianmen were all washed away by the water. When I got out of the mountain sedan chair and walked, I asked him how it got to this point.</p>
<p>"This was washed away by a heavy rain on June 24th! People on the mountain said that it was the Dragon King's heavenly water, and three people drowned below, including a teacher! It is being repaired now."</p>
<p>Walking down this section of the road, the two creepers started walking one in front of the other—the road was gradually leveling out. It was no longer as cold as it was above. So I started chatting with them, pulling east and west:</p>
<p>"Besides the Dai Temple, what other famous places are there in Taian City?"</p>
<p>"Besides the Dai Temple, the famous things in Taian are 'cabbage, tofu, and water'!"</p>
<p>His answer was superfluous. I had tasted these three famous things in Taian: the water really had a different taste, the cabbage had no residue when eaten, and the various patterns and dishes made of tofu were "squeaky." But what I was asking about was not——the creeper next to him said:</p>
<p>"People are asking you about famous places! Sir, there is a very famous thing in Taian County, can you guess what it is? It is the kneeling statue of the former county magistrate! A statue made of iron, it is the kneeling statue of county magistrate Feng Ruji! He was the county magistrate here during Zhang Zongchang's time! He was a corrupt official who almost scraped away all the land in Taian. When he left, the common people, in order to commemorate him for the county magistrates who came later, each contributed a copper plate and put together a statue of him made of iron, kneeling at the gate of the county government! There are two foreign money-like things on his lapel, with the words 'foreign money' on them. These two words are also meaningful: because the county magistrate had two people to help him scrape the land, one was named Yang and one was named Qian! The one named Yang was a local, and fearing it would be ugly, he took out money and bribed them to change it to the word 'foreign'!"</p>
<p>I felt that this matter was quite interesting and asked him:</p>
<p>"Why hasn't anyone told me about this?"</p>
<p>"How would I lie to you! It's true, if you don't believe me, ask him—" As he walked, he stretched out his hand from his belt and pointed to his companion. "If you don't, ask in the city—it won't be wrong at all! Sir hasn't heard people say it, because people who come here don't pay attention to other things; they only know about Mount Tai...Later, this kneeling statue of Feng Ruji disappeared, can you guess how? He spent money and took advantage of the war between the Southern Army and the Jin Army to bury it! Later, it was dug out again and placed in Ximen, it is still there now!"</p>
<p>Sitting on the mountain sedan chair swaying, savoring this interesting story, I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Doumu Palace, we stopped outside for a drink of tea. I went to Doumu Palace to see the famous nuns. One of them was really beautiful, her figure and demeanor were really enchanting. Thinking of the story about the nuns in Doumu Palace written in the second collection of "The Travels of Lao Can," I felt that Liu Tieyun wrote it too realistically. The very beautiful nun was sewing a brightly colored red underwear on the table in front of the Buddhist hall. When I wanted to secretly take a picture of her, she discovered it—and ran to the back room. When walking down, I talked to the two creepers about the nuns in Doumu Palace—</p>
<p>"You think they are strange for making bright red clothes? Heh, damn it, they are really some whores! If you have money, they can live——"</p>
<p>Talking about this, the two creepers became interested. They told me some of their things without any politeness. I thought of the record in the newspaper about "nuns in Taian County lending themselves to give birth"——</p>
<p>"That's not here, that's in ×× Ban (I don't remember the name clearly) nunnery, thirty miles northeast of the city! The nuns there still have braids! If you want to see the nuns, hey, it's best to come in March, naturally in the lunar March, the 14th, 15th, and 16th are the birthday of the Goddess of Mount Tai, and the big opera is performed on the mountain, and the nuns near the mountain all come! Some with braids, some with their hair combed and oiled, and their faces smeared with rouge and powder..."</p>

<p>——See Northward Journey</p>
<p>When the train left the not-so-magnificent Taian Station and continued to advance into the vast northern plains, we discovered new miracles on the earth walls along both sides of the railway.</p>
<p>"Look, why are there so many Japanese advertisements?"</p>
<p>Yun angrily expressed the indignation of the southerners.</p>
<p>"Shandong has also been drawn into the special circle." The hearts of the group were tightly entwined with the same feeling, silently gazing out the car windows at the advertisements that were rare to see in the south and seemed to have no end.</p>

<p>Onimisu Bedbug Repellent</p>
<p>We felt very sad, like grief but also like anger; the same thought floated in our hearts, the country is getting smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>"I heard that their sales are not bad"</p>
<p>A Shandong native in the same car told us:</p>
<p>"So the people have forgotten their hatred for Japan?"</p>
<p>Yun asked sadly.</p>
<p>"No, but the Japanese have great propaganda power and the goods are cheap. When people are sick, they use whatever they see."</p>
<p>"Then what about China's own medicines?" Yun asked抢着.</p>
<p>"How many of your own products have you seen?" The Shandong native grinned, revealing a mouthful of black teeth. The strong smell of scallions startled Yun, who was standing opposite him, and he retreated to the car window and spat several times. "Moreover, the price is also expensive!"</p>
<p>...The train rumbled over the iron bridge. Lying under the iron bridge was the riverbed, which was typical of the north, dry like a desert, with two deep wheel tracks.</p>
<p>Looking at the boundless yellow field stretching out under the blue sky, we pondered in disappointment...</p>
