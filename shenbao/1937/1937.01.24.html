<h3>汪講民主政治</h3>
<p>［南京］二十一日下午四時、行政院各部會長、在國際聯歡社開茶會、歡迎中央政治委員會主席汪精衛、首由孔副院長庸之致詞、大意述二十一年來、各部會同人與汪氏共同努力之經過、及此次欣盼回京之意、並謂因汪氏病後戒口、故謹備簿茶、略表敬意、旋由汪氏起立致謝、並路述療病經過、及一年以來蔣委員長兼長行政、與各部會同人勵精圖治、國防建設及財政外交均有顯著進步、本人至為盛佩、其大意已見各報、不復贅錄、惟其中有論民主政治一段、各報有未及登載者、由汪氏報自撰錄、茲發表如次、</p>
<p>剛才孔先生要兄弟述在歐數月的感想、兄弟實在慚愧、覺得沒有什麽貢獻、因為數月中均在療養院、與歐洲各界人士絕少往還、聞見不廣、勉强说來、當歐洲大戰以後、推倒了不少君主專制國家、建設了民主政體、都在根據十八九世紀以來的民主學說、制定新憲法、當時一般人士觀察、均以為民主政治從此盛行、民主政治當為政治之極則、料不到忽然有蘇聯無產階級獨裁政治的也現、忽竟又意大利法西斯主義、德意志國社主義、相繼出現、這兩種政治、內容形式各有不同、其是非得失、亦暫不欲討論、但其為民主政治之反對者、則誰也不能否認、因此一般人土、又有一種感覺、以為民主政治、將有這夾攻形勢之中、卽於沒落、然而英法不仍是民主政治麽、美不仍是民主政治麽、中華民國是民主的國家、中國國民黨是民權主義的奉行者、數年以來、蔣委員長對於中國不適宜獨裁政治、鄭重說了有多少遍、中國現今及將來、仍將向着民主政治這條路走、是無疑義的、民主政治的反對論者、列舉民主政治的最大缺點、不外選舉流弊多、取决之不足恃、以及行政系統因受其他機關之牽掣、動作遲慢、效能低微以至軟弱無力等等、其實這些缺點、總理在民權主義中早已看出、並早已加以修正了、我們確信民權主義是一種最適合於民主政治的學說原則、絕不是隨意模仿十八九世紀以來的民主政治學說者、所可同日而語、如果根據民權主義以推行民主政治絕不會有以上所舉各種流弊的、卽以現今英法美等國之民主政治而論、其在平時、固然給與人民政治上之自由較多、政府措施之能力、有時候實在不免稍為軟弱然一到國家有了非常變故的時候政府權力之集中、行動之敏捷、可以充分發揮無虞掣肘、歐戰當中這種現象已經顯著、不惟歐戰時國家危急存亡之際應當如此、卽如最近數年、美國以救濟經濟恐慌之故、國會授與大權於大總統羅斯福、俾得行使自由、美國是現今世界上富强的國家遇有小小危機尚目如此、何况中國現在尚是調政的時候、又是內憂外患重交迫的時候、如有良好的政府、人民予以信任、使得盡心竭力、完成救亡圖存的計劃與步驟、是極為當然的、還有一層、正為平時將政治自由給國人民愈多、一旦有非常之變、則應付更加容易、因為國家由人民集合而成人民的政治能力强大則國家的力量、亦因以强大、好比軍隊一樣如果平日士兵操練有素能力充足、則一旦有事、舉行動員、這枝軍隊定然是最勇敢最有紀律的軍隊、世界的政治學說對於機關的權限如何、雖有問題對於培養人民的政治能力、絕無疑義的卽如最近西安事變、固然中央處置得宜蔣先生精誠感格、而全國輿論及人民意思之表現、極一致極嚴肅、實在是一種强有力的後援、由此可知培養人民的政治能力、在救亡圖存中、實為重要原則、深顧批評民主治政者、於此一點不要忽略、至於政府權力之應該集中、應該統一、以期應付國難、與培養人民的政治能力、并無矛盾、蓋應付國難、政府與民衆相依為命、是其本質、政府盡忠於人民、人民信任其政府、是其活動、政府沒有民衆作基礎、無論民主政治不能樹立、卽獨裁政治亦不能樹立、例如蘇聯是有無產階級、為其基礎、意德是有其多數職業的人民為其基礎、這些人民、一方面痛恨大資本家之暴橫、一方面痛恨共產黨之擾亂、所以誠心誠意擁護政府、以求復興、英美法等則各黨各派各代表一部份人民的利益、在一定的政治方式內、聯合存在、雖其形態種種不同、而其以民衆為基礎、則是一樣的、中國今日在內憂外患、重重交迫之中、惟有以整個國家、整個民族的共同利益為根據、以求團結、方纔立得定個强有力的基礎、由此强有力的基礎、以建築强有力的機關、卽所謂政府以應會國難、這正是向著總理所定民權主義的大路上走去、救亡圖存有賴於此、謹舉此杯、祝蔣院長的健康、及各部會長官暨同人的健康、（二十三日中央社電）</p>

<h3>從中國哲學會說到哲學的用處</h3>
<p>— 馮友蘭</p>
<p>中國哲學會自今天起，至二十六日止，在首都開第三屆年會，此會為中國研究哲學的人所組織的全國的團體。有北平，南京，廣州三個分會。出有哲學評論季刋，現已至七卷二期，由上海開明書店發行。我現在願藉哲學會開會的這個日子，說一點哲學的用處，以引起大家對於哲學的興趣及注意。</p>
<p>我現在所要說的，是哲學在政治及社會方面的用處。因為這些用處是直接的，顯而易見的。現在全國之中，上自當局，下至青年學生，都喜歡這一類的用處。至於哲學，同別的學問一樣，還有些無用之用：我現在暫不說。</p>
<p>中國哲學會第一屆年會於二十四年四月在北平開會時，大公報記者會呌我寫了一點感想。在那篇短文裏，我說：“我們現在所處的世界，在表面上看起來，似乎很不注重哲學，但在骨子裏我們這個世界是極重視哲學的。走遍世界，在大多數國家裏，都有他所提倡及禁止的哲學。在這一點我們可見現在的人是如何感覺到哲學的力量。每一種政治社會制度，都需要一種理論上的根據。必須有了理論上的根據，那一種政治社會組織，纔能“名正言順”。我在歷史上看起來，每一種社會，都有他思想上的“太祖高皇帝”。例如中國秦漢以後的孔子，西洋中世紀的耶穌，近世的盧梭等等，都是一種社會制度的理論上的靠山，一種社會中的思想上的“太祖高皇帝”。現在不僅只是各民族競爭生存的世界，而且又是各種社會制度競爭生存的世界，所以大家皆感覺到社會制度之理論的根據之重要。”二年過去了，我所說的情形，依然未變。世界有許多的國家，都要立一種哲學，以為“道統”，以“正人心，息邪說，距跛行，放淫辭。”我們在那一種社會裏，我們卽在那一種“道統”裏，不過我們如同呼吸空氣一樣久而不覺其有罷了。</p>
<p>說到這裏，哲學的用處未免太大了。我再說一點哲學的小用處。</p>
<p>近來有人說哲學並不是求眞理的。哲學所作的事情，是把科學或常識中的命題的意義，分析清楚，我們暫不管這種說法是不是可以槪括哲學全部，我們可以說至少這是一部分的哲學的用處之一。現在政治上，社會上有許多大家所爭論的問題，大家所喊的口號。我們若用邏輯把這些問題或口號加以分析，有些問題，卽不成間題，有些口號，卽不成中號。</p>
<p>譬如近來有“爭取救國自由”的口號。“救國自由”這個名詞，實在是含混的很。他至少有三種意義。第一種是，願意救國卽救國，救國的工作不受限制。第二種是，願意怎樣救國卽怎樣救國，救國的方法不受限制。第三種是，願意救國卽救國，願意不救國或不願意救國卽不救國，個人的行為不受强迫。照第一種的意義，救國自由，一定可以有。照第三種意義，救國自由，一定不可以有。照第二種的意義，救國自由，可以有，亦不可以有：可以有，如果所用的許多方法，不是衝突的；不可以有，如果所用的許多方法，是衝突的。爭取救國自由的人，所爭取的，是那一種意義的救國自由；限制救國自由的人，所限制的是那一種意義的救國自由；若說清楚了，可以省去許多無謂的糾紛。</p>
<p>又譬如近來有人說，求學問是不能救國的，因為有許多人求了多年的學，到現在國家還是不得了。為此說者，實由於不明白普通邏輯中所謂必要與充足之分。一件事情的成功，要靠許多條件。有些條件，是必要而不充足。有些條件，是充足而不必要。有些條件，是必要而又充足。必要而不充足的條件，是“有之不必然，無之必不然。”例如人若只吃飯不必卽能活，但不吃飯一定不能活。充足而不必要的條件，是“有之必然，無之不必不然。”例如人得傷寒病必發熱，但不得傷寒病，不一定不發熱；他得了瘧疾，一樣可以發熱。充足而又必要的條件，是“有之必然，無之必不然。”例如人的心臟停止活動，則人死。充足而又必要的條件，只最簡單的事情有。若救國這種千頭萬緒的事情，其成功，不知要靠多少條件：每個條件都是必要而不充足。有之不必能救國，但是無之必不能救國。求學問對於救國的關係，是這樣一個關係。練兵，修路，訓練民衆，等等，對於救國，都是這樣一個關係。如說只靠求學問不能救國，所以學問可以不要，卽如說只靠吃飯不能呌人活，所以可以不吃飯。現在的人多想作一種事，只靠此一種事卽可救國。這種事不但現在沒有，將來也沒有，而且更沒有。因為社會越進化，卽分工越細，每件事對於社會，都是必要而不充足。這固然是常識，但用邏輯講起來，更見得清楚。</p>
<p>又譬如近來關於所謂文化問題之爭論，也可以用邏輯來解圍。有“中國本位文化”一個名詞；這個名詞本身卽可有兩種意義。第一種意義，是以中國為本位的文化。第二種意義，是以中國舊有文化為本位的文化。照第一種意義，中國本位文化，可以說沒有人不贊成。凡是主張建設中國新文化的，無論那一派，沒有不自以為是中國的利益的，卽沒有不自以為是以中國為本位的。若照第二個意義，卽有爭論了。有主張所謂全盤西化及主張所謂部分西化者，與之爭論。其實這些爭論若由邏輯看，大部分是很容易解决的。邏輯上有所謂箇體與類型之分。一個箇體，可代表許多類型。例如孔子可代表許多類型，如春秋時人，山東人，活過七十歲的人，聖人，等等。這個箇體學那個箇體，實在所學者，是他所代表的某一類型，或某幾類型。例如有些人要學孔子，實在是想學他所代表之型人類型。箇體是不能學的。所謂西洋是一箇體，在文化方面，他代表許多類型，如耶教文化，科學文化，工業文化等。我們說學西洋，實在是學他所代表之某一文化類型或某幾文化類型，例如科學文化，或工業文化。至於中國原有文化之不與此衝突者，當然不改。例如朱熹學孔子，朱熹不是山東人，但不是山東人與是聖人並無衝突，朱熹不必改為是山東人。由此觀點看去，上述幾派關於文化之爭論，有些是不必爭而自解决的。</p>
<p>哲學的小用處，雖不足以“正人心”，而亦可以“放浮辭”。凡不合乎邏輯的辯論，或自邏輯看，沒有意義的辯論，都是淫辭。政治上，社會上，如沒有淫辭，則無謂的糾紛，可以减去許多。</p>

<p>［東京］日陸軍及政黨間之衝突、先釀成內閣解散議會之决定、繼有妥協運動、終則內閣出於總辭職、此似為日本政治上合於邏輯之順序、當昨日閣議决定解散議會之原則時、已留有調停之餘地、企圖於最後二十四小時內、確知政黨是否完全决意倒閣、設政黨無此决心、則向軍部要求妥協、因此海相永野於昨晚着手調停、政黨旣接受調停、在理自可化險為夷、惟軍部堅持解散議會、且謂政黨以自由主義之見解、評議國策、於日本前途及發展上大有妨礙、且舍解散議會外、別無使政黨反省之道、反之、閣員自始卽不欲解散議會、尤以政黨現已接受妥協絛件、解散更無根據、緊急閣議舉行前、關於主張及反對解散議會意見之爭辯、已頗劇烈、故閣議結果遂有總辭職之决定、（二十三日中央社電）</p>

<h3>新首相人選近衛呼聲最高</h3>
<p>左派組織維新政黨　日本政局愈趨複雜</p>
<p>［東京］歷來每遇政變、日皇卽召西園寺公進京、或派侍從長詢其繼任內閣總理之人選、迄今已成為慣例、但此次陸軍方面、對於繼任內閣、反對由舊有政黨派員入閣、並預先主張由新內閣解散議會、態度至為强硬、是以收拾時局、尚須相當時日、西園寺公卽使奉命推薦、亦必具其極慎重之態度、且該公爵近染微恙、縱有上命、恐亦未便進京、綜合各項情勢、尤須洞察陸軍方面之意向、或許連絡湯淺內府與松本宮相及其他重臣、轉請侍從長奉答下問、亦未可知、目下候補總理之有力者如公爵近衛文麼•男爵平沼騏一郎•陸軍大將宇垣一成•海軍大將末次信正等人、但陸軍方面則希望近衛公爵出馬云、（廿三日同盟）</p>
<p>［東京］今晨各報社評一致反對解散議會、但一部份報紙同時反對內閣辭職、贊成妥協、還有其他若干報紙、認內閣辭職係打開目前僵局之唯一方策、目前最後序幕尚未揭開、而組織新黨之運動、已在着着進行中、其中一部份擁護近衛文麼、一部份擁護宇垣一成、傳兩派均能在政民兩黨中獲得若干贊助、但極難獲得多數之贊助、日本政局已臻於極端複雜之階段、（二十三日中央社電）</p>

<h3>陸軍反對黨人入閣</h3>
<p>新陸相人選　杉山或板壇</p>
<p>［東京］陸軍方面對於繼任內閣之希望、大致可分為左列各項、</p>
<p>㊀繼任內閣對於目下國際情勢之嚴重性、須具有深刻之認識、對外期以發展日本國力、對內須實現新政、網羅真摯熱誠之人物、組織强有力之內閣、</p>
<p>㊁新內閣須實行一新庶政、充實國防、安定國民生活、斷行强力國策、以此為重大使命、對於閣員必須網羅於、非常時局具有充分認識之人物、同時對於時局認識不同之政黨、倘與之妥協茍合、則絕對排斥之、</p>
<p>㊂如與此種政黨謀提携、或以此種黨人為閣員、則陸軍對於此種內閣、當難與之協助、屆時對於推薦離任陸相亦不得不躊躇者也云、（廿三日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］廣田內閣崩潰後、組織繼任內閣之際、最視為重要者、當係陸相一席究屬何人之問題、軍部方面認為有望者言為現任教育總監杉山元大將、或朝鮮軍司令官小磯國昭中將與將東軍參謀長板垣征四郎中將、由此三人中選任其一、杉山大將之就任最易、但亦須俟織任內閣主宰者之意見若何而定、倘以實行積極革新政策為主張、則板垣中將之出馬最認為有力者也、（廿三日同盟電）</p>
<h3>貴衆兩院决定休會</h3>
<p>至新閣成立時止</p>

<p>［東京］廣田首相在本日閣議席上發表、推薦有田外相為勅選議員、有田外相謂、本人今有所感、請辭勅選、故暫行停止奏請、（二十三日同盟）</p>
<h3>英報評論</h3>
<p>［倫敦］孟却斯德保衛報、頃就日本廣田內閣辭職一事、加以評論、略稱、“今後日本所當選擇之途徑、與𨑌昔意大利與德國所選舉之途徑、實有不同、蓋意德兩國、係就法西斯主義與社會主義之二途中、選擇共一、惟今後日本所當選擇之二途、則其一為軍人寡頭政治、而木顧及大企業之利益、其一則為平民之官僚政治、此二途必擇其一而後可、日本苟發生革命、則由軍部加以策動、較諸由農工發動、實更有可能、軍部方面之所希望者、在於政府與議會之互相對立、然此種對立傾向、日益加深、則不僅引起民治主義者之疑懼、且政友會與民政黨等各大政黨、感於本身存在之受威脅、亦必深為不安也”云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>航行廣州江門渡船民族號觸礁沉沒</h3>
<p>搭客與船員溺斃百餘人　估計損失共約十五萬元</p>
<p>廣州通信粵省江門鎮為全省四巨市之一商業繁盛、交通四達、亦恩平•開平•台山•新會四縣水道出入之孔道故該四邑人士來往省垣與鄕間多趁江門渡船因此該處航業、甚為發達、而行駛廣州與江門間之渡船、以搭客衆多之故、營業隨之蒸蒸日上、渡船中之“民族”號、向為各鄕渡之冠、保護週密設備完善船身又比別船巨大、航行廣江間、歷安無異、不意粵省月來天災人禍洊臻米荒之中、陸上廣九路焚車慘案甫發生、而水上之民族號渡船又突沉沒、溺斃百數十人、禍不單行、誠為今日粵中社會寫照、茲將沉船慘劇摘要紀述、</p>
<p>險灘</p>
<p>順德縣屬之甘竹灘、久成歷史上畏途、灘石羣立江中、西江水流至此、為灘石阻遏、瀦蓄廻漩、浪聲達里許、春夏潦季、水勢湍急如箭、小火輪雖開足馬力、亦難逆流上溯、冬季水涸、船隻越灘又感困難、灘中巨石嶙峋、尤以俗稱之“香爐石”為險峻、香爐石對岸有天后宮、為迷信鄕人所建、相傳來往船隻經此參神後、渡灘始獲安全、香爐石位於廟宇之前、不啻為該廟一天然香爐、其得名蓋由此、一說謂歷來船隻在此遇險、死人無算、此石卽為衆生水葬地之香爐、由此懸想、灘道難行、可見一斑、至沉船事實、遠者不具論、卽近數年來、渡船在此遇事、幾乎每年一次、鶴山輪船•公元輪船、都省（由廣州至都城）永安號渡船、先後沉沒、動輒溺斃百數十人、去年曾有人建議、將灘石轟炸、以殺水勢、而利航行、然利害相衡、又難辦到、蓋灘石夷平、當潦季時西江狂流奔騰而下、無可堵遏、一瀉千里、下游各鄕落、將有其魚之嘆、炸灘之舉、經鄕人環請呼籲、遂告中止、故目下甘竹灘頭、依然為航行之大患、</p>
<p>肇事</p>
<p>來往廣州江門之民族號渡船、規定每日下午七時由廣州開行、十九日下午、照例開行、載有搭客三百四十餘人、另有貨物一大宗、道經順德屬黃連勒流而入裏海、過鄧滘沙折出見龍橋、然後上灘、時在二十日凌晨三時許當至香爐石時、前行拖挽民族號船之小輪模範號、亟開速率、已越灘而過、惟民族渡船因身重水淺、經兩次拖引、仍未越過灘頭、最後作第三次過灘、船身砰然觸礁、貨倉洞穿、成一巨穴、河水汩汩而入、斯時搭客均從酣睡中驚覺、知為遇事、咸爭相奔避、呼喊救命聲、鬧成一片、間有熟識水性者、卽躍水而逃、未幾、衆客攢緊於一隅、船身欹側、全部入水、可憐數百生命、遂與船艙一併沉沒、</p>
<p>拯救</p>
<p>民族渡船沉沒之際、前行之小輪模範號、卽折回拯救、當塲救回十餘人、運往岸旁安置、同時行駛同一航綫之渡船、如中華·大九江·合興·大安·其發等號、先後經過、觀狀急趨前施救、共救得約一百八十餘人、送往江門、當時江門明善堂、立派救生船四艘、紅十字會派船一艘、駛往遇事地點、設法救生、二十日上午十一時許到達、在甘竹灘右坑撈獲男女屍七具、多穿布衣、年約三四十歲、另有女童屍一具、至困處艙中屍體未浮出者、預算有百餘人、至於船上貨物、則已漂流一空、已沉之民族號、僅露船桅及篷頂、船員中有十餘人生還、但有八名失踪、至被救生回者、除自行返江門外、受傷者就近在甘竹愛仁善堂醫院救治、是日甘竹善堂、亦派出土役前往撈屍、</p>
<p>撈屍</p>
<p>遇難逃生者回江門後、卽向縣府報告、新會縣李縣長立卽電報省府及民廳、請由省派撈屍隊及絞船前往辦理、同時模範號小輪將救獲之搭客二十餘人送省、并向船公司報告、該公司立僱救生艇四艘、起重機船四艘、着模範輪運往肇事地點施救、同日方便醫院亦派出救護隊及檢屍隊、携備工具、乘船前往工作、其後又用船購棺木八九十具、運往殮屍、并將檢得之屍就近拍照編號、以便棺殮、停厝於岸旁、待屍親認領、不再運省、以省手續、由省開往之救生艇及救護隊、二十日下午八時抵遇事地、惟時在夜間、不便工作、至二十一日晨、始用起重機蔣沉船絞起、并將困艙之屍撿出、故溺斃實數、尚待詳查、惟就救回百餘人之數核計、、則溺斃者當在百人以外、</p>
<p>損失</p>
<p>此次民族船開往江門、因時近年關、鄕中多向省購貨、由渡船運返、估計船上共有貨物約值三四萬元、搭客財物散失約二三萬元、至於民族船連船值及裝置費、共損失七八萬元、合共損失有十五萬元溺斃之屍、因流水湍急、多漂至遠處、亦有沉澱於礁石間、尚未浮出水面者、其已打撈之屍類、多面目臃腫、認屍殊感困難、</p>
<p>餘聞</p>
<p>據船員稱、此次民族渡船之沉沒、當入水時、搭客若持以鎮靜、不作倉皇之逃避、或可挽救於萬一、因該船建築時、在船底另加一重木樁、防船底洞穿、亦可藉木樁之保障、而從事補救、但此次遇事、搭客奔聚一隅、致船身傾側、補救辣手、該船載客額限定三百八十二名、而是日所載搭客僅三百四十四名、船旁吃水綫規定距水面八英寸、而該晚所載重不但未逾額、且吃水綫距水面約有一英尺有奇、（一月二十一日）</p>

<p>下半時　檸檬後、五分鐘內測量攻勢極盛、但不久卽為優游操縱惟仍因遲緩、疊失良機、多至不可勝計、相持約廿分鐘、測量捲土重來、全軍又深入腹地、趙茲生營救心切、不慎用手吻球判罰十二碼、被其中堅海耐萊射中、二比二又造平等、測量乘勢猛迫、優游境內極度險惡幸不久卽告教平、旋沈世琦於二十碼處得罰任意球機會、角度極佳、又因缺乏接應、未完大功、迨最後一分鐘時測量中鋒哈立遜射門、王之高過於大意、雙手略擋、竟被穿進、遂以三對二斷送錦標賽畢、當塲給獎、測量捧字林盃以去雙方陣容如下、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>空方見風轉柁</p>
<p>傳有多頭公司組織　紗價回漲本月尤緊</p>
<p>紗市本月趨堅、且漲風又起、蓋聞二月期有多頭公司組織、凖備奮斗之說、於是空方將本月籌碼集中收轉、套賣二月期同時、以前本月價小、套利者亦屬不少、因此本月頭襯反見乾枯、且僅剩明日一天營業、浮空了結益衆、市盤愈漲矣、本月現紗交易、雖有二千四百包成交、其中同業占有一千三百包、購買一月期貨、預防軋空之用、</p>
<p>空方收回交貨籌碼</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、近月受買方之拉提、致檯面緊迫、浮戶抵補、市盤緩步上升、且本月份僅剩今明二天營業、空方交貨籌碼、業已收轉掉至二月期、於是近期氣勢獨挺、惟遠期因紗銷清寂三品紗回跌、買者减少、而現紗生意愈滯、標紗結果、近月比上日收盤價漲一元至一元三角、遠漲三•六角、午後開盤本月被空方收回、套利收貨、市况步趨步緊、但遠月尚和平、一盤後近期續進、本月漲出五十元開外、結果近月比上午收盤價漲一元半至八角遠漲二•三角、查賣出、長豐一千一百五十包泰昌一千五百包、大孚八百五十包、信誠七百五十包合興一千六百包、望泰興八百包、大昌成一手包、恒昌九百包、大昶一千包、永昌六百包、昶記七百包、森康一千二百五十包、買進福康一千一百包、吉豐一千六百包、裕大一千○五十包、明德九百包、賡豐一千七百包、潤康一千五百五十包、協成九百包、元一一千三百包、同和六百五十包、茲將市價比較於下、</p>

<p>棉市絕少榮辱可言</p>
<p>棉市平淡無神、絕無榮辱可言、故上下甚微、市態益呈呆木之勢、至於海外美印棉市亦屬徘徊徬徨之狀、於是更乏生色也、</p>
<p>棉價不脫五分一角上下</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月微見上升、但塲中交易殊覺寂寞、多空兩方俱無興奮性、因此買賣甚稀海外棉業狀况亦不脫疲境、標花結果各月比上日收盤價均漲五分至一角午後開盤、市情毫無變卦、上下五分、交易甚少結果二•三月比上午收盤價跌五分至一角、其餘勿動、查賣出、新昶一千二百担、永大一千六百提、長餘一千担、大昌成一千一百担、澗康一千三百担、長和六千三百担、源大一千一百担、經華三手四百担、買進、通記二千一百担、德大一千担、大孚三千一百担、裕康二千四百担、錦昌一千一百担、長豐一千八百担、生源一千三百担、豐泰一千四百担、仁豐一千担、元一二千一百担、恒昌二千百担、益康一千担愼記一千二百担、行市比較如下、</p>

<p>紗布紅利開新紀錄</p>
<p>半年盈餘每股紅利十二元　經紀人盈念餘萬至二三萬</p>
<p>本市華商紗布交易所二十五年度營業狀况殊為發達收入激增、創造交易所成立十五年以來之新紀錄、下半屆營業更勝上半屆、帳目業已决算、每股紅利分派十一元正、經紀人方面、利潤亦豐厚、獲利最巨者為二十六萬元至盈餘二三萬元者尤衆、業棉花者比較稍遜、但亦稱不惡、查其營業起色之原因、為標金證券市塲趨勢暗淡、一般投機商目標轉移紛集紗花市塲、因此波浪殊大市價升降迅速、棉紗有七十五六元之譜、棉花有八九元之變遷就全體言為交易所有史以來之最美滿之年度也、</p>
<p>美棉業限價收進</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况堅定、但欠活動、各月漲跌一磅音、近月因有同業限價單進、殊形堅定、就大體而論、同業均在等候借欵棉花問題之正式宣佈因之期現市塲、交易均淸、新戶平淡、低級現棉之脚地益軟、收盤堅定、計現貨漲二磅音、期貨由不動至漲二磅音、英棉現貨跌六點、期貨漲一點、印棉初因買戶轉售而疲、旋以散戶多頭買進而堅、卒因老多頭脫手市價再軟、計平果函跌一•二五至一•五羅比、奧姆辣跌一至賺比、白羅溪跌一•一五羅比、原電錄左、（二十二日電）</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>洋麥報趺粉麥行市驟虛</p>
<p>午後始稍稍回振　近期粉市氣仍平</p>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈先跌繼見回振之象、因洋麥報價、芝加哥近跌八角零、遠跌四五角、坎拿大跌三五六角不等、利物浦跌二便士零、當開價後、以洋麥之趨勢不穩、價又逐步驟鬆、所以市塲人心、均見惡化、本月份開價又低至三元八角一分半、二月份至八角四分、三月份至八角八分半、四月份至九角二分半、較前日均慘落六七分之、巨以便各盤、因多頭多數呆擯、空方則隨市抵進、價遂見定、迨至下午開盤本月份因交割已近、多頭無互擯之力、故市氣尚平、惟遠期各月份、因廠出不盛浮空大補、業外又趁勢略抬、故又轉緊、較上午之最低價、計回好三四分、惟後步局面、照國內固仍看小面、但中心之樞紐、仍以國外報佳為轉移云、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤、各月份市面、又呈鬆落無神之象、以洋麥報價、又跌二五六八角不等、及一便士零、國內正鬧去化之不暢、國外又亦步步見鬆、未免予多頭以難堪、故開價後、本月份及一月份卽較跌一角、三月份以下、因交易甚形寂寞、跌勢較差、紙小六七八分、迨至下午開盤、初亦甚疲、旋開粉市回振、人心遂亦轉昂、因一部分之業中空頭、急於抵補、市面遂回上六七分、現麥市面、因標凖又跌、喊價又鬆六七分、開江北麥六元一角一分、崇明麥六元零八分、次四分、計開二千餘包云、</p>
<p>美阿新麥豐收有望</p>
<p>二十二日芝加哥麥市因外國市疲、浮多了結、廠需極劣、跌一分半至二分半、</p>
<p>上週芝加哥麥市趨跌、南半球小麥週內共裝來一千一百四十三萬六千斛、市面受此影響、價格暴跌、按去年阿根廷麥於一週內會裝出約二倍此數、到貨旣湧、市價無疑將受壓、然世界需要極大、如德國與意大利均需小麥、或能將此不良勢力抵銷、本國廠需甚劣、新麥收成展望進步、麥苗情形在平常之上、故料麥市將續有回風、惟若于商人對小麥長期展望尚看漲、</p>
<p>客秈粵帮去路突減</p>
<p>行盤回小角許</p>
<p>昨日客秈到頭續有、市上存底更充、而粵帮去胃突减、昨祇辦去江西機糙晚一千多包、本街辦胃亦淡、計成二千包左右、總計成交不滿四千包、故行情跌小五六分至一角左右不等、後市上落、仍須看粵帮消化旺淡為轉移、因其他客帮均以年底收東、無意問津、而本街亦無暢胃也、</p>
<p>河米交易較前更為清淡</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、較前轉夥、共到七十號左右、貨約萬五千五六百石、內薄稻計三十餘號、本街銷塲仍屬呆滯、包胃亦祇靑島帮辦薄稻一千五六百包、致形勢疲軟、市况仍難支持、結果薄稻行情續降一二角不等、厚粳步落幾分至一角、照目下情形似仍恐難以立足耳、杜洋尖帶軟數分陰變元一以價位較高、一以到貨見湧、致價猝落二角以外、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源五十餘號、市上各貨銷路較前更見淡弱、惟白粳零星四戶取巧稍動、白粳價小一二角早薄稻價小近角、白元價小七八分、羊埠尖貨稀、價形平疲、其餘各貨、價亦疲小數分、</p>
<p>豆餅走銷尚稱不惡</p>
<p>返二日豆餅市况、因大連市况仍屬軟化致人心不免見虛故市情見修、但去路尚稱不惡、良以一般行商套利旨趣濃厚、且汕頭帮訂交期餅不懈所以市氣仍居平穩之局、昨市做開現出四牌餅三千片、訂二月份交一萬五千片、訂三月份交一萬片、行情現出修分譜、二月份不動、惟三月份獨挫二分云、</p>
<p>二十五年油餅漲風無匹</p>
<p>成交反見廿四年為少</p>
<p>自改革幣制以來、國內各種市價、與日俱進、植物類、在世界戰備中為必需之物、故本埠荳油市價、在大連行情突飛猛晉之下、隨之推波逐浪、至十一月份及十二月份中、漲風之銳厲、實開數年來空前之變遷、然價雖劇漲、而市塲中統年公開成交數、反較二十四年份减少十分之－、（列表如下）</p>
<p>（註）每一商品，並列兩價，其前一之價，為二十五年市價。後一之價，為二十四年市價。</p>
<h3>證券</h3>
<p>公債補空與掉期居多</p>
<p>漸呈軋空局面</p>
<p>昨日公債市塲、為一月期之最後二天、市况因浮空均起抵補、及掉期踴躍、漸呈軋空之狀、檯面交易頗盛、大戶拋賣及吸收者均仍不少、致相持頗堅、而形成近疲遠堅之勢、明日係本月份期貨之最後一天、多空屆時尚遭傾軋、惟因人心之堅挺、堪有軋空之虞他、昨日上午開盤、趨勢尚見疲軟、四號每項均有日額瀉出、散戶頗多收購、除戊種徵好五分、餘均下跌一二角、次盤市况轉趨昂漲、三十五•四十四號等買進不少、散戶進胃愈濃、戊乙等復回漲一角左右、甲種遠期因四號續有賣出、跌落一角、下午開盤、掉期交易轉旺、三十八•四十七•號等及散戶均多空頭掉期、三十五•七十二•等仍係收買、丙種下月降跌一角、他如乙甲等再升一二角、收盤仍微有軋空之勢、檯面掉期者愈形擁擠、市價又上漲五分一角、甲種則小二角、全日結果、統一各債近期上漲一二角、遠期均疲跌五分一角、成交總數、計八百七八萬五千元、茲將其漲跌高低比較、列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>黑鐵皮軋缺大俏</p>
<p>薄鐵開價七十五元</p>
<p>黑鐵皮　近來因定價飛漲、同業購定甚少、故到貨極微、但出路因搪磁廠•熱水瓶廠•等紛紛收羅、致存貨被購益少、標凖為環境關係、節節上升、刻市二尺•六尺•十八張、每扣售十三元半、比前好起一元、三尺•六尺•每担售十五元、比前亦好一元半、查來貨不多市存薄弱、後市恐難回小、</p>
<p>薄鐵　昨日開價已至七十五元、聞香烟廠•餅乾公司•等紛紛收進、是以市勢絕佳、開價因人心奇好、故一時亦不易降落也、</p>

<h3>蝸牛的教訓</h3>
<p>— 德隣</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們平時在學校裏讀書，什麽作文咧，算術咧，習字咧，等等的功課：往往不是因為成績的落後，遭着敎師們的呵責；但是你們不要認為這是奇恥大辱，而更灰心了，你們只要把各項的功課，勤奮地學習着；遇到了書本上疑難的問題，和不明瞭的地方，可以儘量地檢了出來，去請求敎師的詳細指導，自己再用心牢牢的記住，你們如其能夠照這個樣子切實地去做着，那未你們的智識，和學問，自然可以得到日積月累的高深造就了，不信的話，我現在可以舉一個榜樣出來。</p>
<p>便是在牆壁上的媧牛，它向上前進的時候，不是爬得很慢嗎？但是它蜿蜓着上進，不暴躁，耐了性，然而它的速度，却出乎我們意料之外的非常神速，所以小朋友們，你們不要因為在努力求學的過程中，似乎覺到沒有絲毫的增進，，現在看了在牆壁上爬着的事件，這便可以作為你們的敎訓，和良好的榜樣了</p>
<h3>冀東小學生一把辛酸淚</h3>
<p>— 華明</p>
<p>我前幾天接到一封家信，使我感到無限悲哀，冀東學校改課本的辣令，已見實行了。最令人痛心的，就是變相的焚書政策，也被他們運用了。凡是過去小學生讀過的課本，都被他們收去，至於焚不焚，那也不必問了。</p>
<p>我知道現在的冀東，是不能再讓兒童在那裏求學了。可是我的家鄕是在那裏——唐山，所以不得不使我那小兄弟暫時受罪，何况他在今年暑假就要在某高小畢業，而轉學他處（天津或北平）在這種不得已的情况下，我時常去信，呌他切實用功，其他可不必管。</p>
<p>前天他給我來了一封信，沒有讀完，我的眼淚就不自主的流下來。我的悲傷，一面為中國前途着想，一面是同情我那小弟弟的遭殃。這裏寫的是：</p>
<p>“哥哥，你屢次來信，囑我用功，我是很聽從，不過現在想用功也沒法了。因為我那第五冊四冊六冊的國語，自然，社會，都被人收去了。現在我手裏僅僅有他們發下的第五冊國語，那上滿是這個那個這些東西，念着不但呌人生氣，同時對於我的升學也毫無帮助，哥哥呀，將來升學時怎能考得上呢？請你趕快和嫂子商量，使我到上海來，咱們的家鄕實在不能住了，最可怕就是那些什麽顧問，常要來參觀我們的學校，我們的老師，一看他來了，臉色就變個焦黑，說話也差了，滿口是擁護……親善……呌人聽了眞是刺耳，所以有一次我們有一個同學氣得站起了和老師辯白，不曉得那位顧問馬上打了他二下嘴巴子，我們簡直氣昏了。哥哥，你看這書還能念下去麽？……一寫到這裏，他那信紙上全是淚痕了。我是他的哥哥，怎能不表同情呢。</p>
<p>眼下冀東還是在中國人手裏，已經是如此了，將來更當怎樣？</p>
<p>一個十三歲的孩子能給我通這樣的信，總算是個有心的呀！所以才把它抄下來，以求揭曉現在冀東的慘狀！</p>

<h3>中級徽章的奧妙</h3>
<p>答洛陽　鄭文英</p>
<p>文英弟：</p>
<p>你肯這樣更進一步去研究童子軍功課，這種求學的態度，就是事業成功的要素呢！</p>
<p>一般童子軍對於中級徽章的意義都是明白的，但他們却祇知道中級徽章象徵着笑口，祇知道行善結和“智勇仁”的意羲；而並沒有像你那樣想到下列三個問題：</p>
<p>㊀為什麽中級徽章要有一個行善結？</p>
<p>㊁為什麽行善結要和象徵笑口的徽章連繫起來？</p>
<p>㊂“智仁勇”三字和下面的善結有甚麽關係？</p>
<p>不錯，你這個發問是很對的，但這些道理在課本上是得不到解答的。不過我們可以用常識把它理解出來。</p>
<p>要解答第一個問題、你先要記起你自己領巾上的善結。那領巾上的結是當你第一天穿起制服時就要天天把它結上的，它會提醒你去行善，也會鼓舞你去行善。但到了中級畢業，你的工作就跟着增多，行善的責任也加大了，同時還要做初級童子軍的榜樣。因此除了領巾上的善結以外，還要佩上附有善結的徽章，這就表示你身上多了一個善結，告訴你說責任加重了。</p>
<p>要解答第二個問題，你固然會想到我們的第八條規律，它告訴我們要時常帶着笑容，但我們怎樣才能時常愉快呢？唯一的方法就是助人呀！因為行善是快樂之本，貝登堡老大哥已這樣告訴過我們了呵。</p>
<p>要解答第三個問題，最好行善。但還得要有行善的决心請你翻開總會出版的月刋第一期，本社鄭𦤃樟君在那裏有一篇行善的理論，有一段是這樣說：</p>
<p>“在沒有行善以前，先要有充分的凖備，臨時還要有判斷善惡的能力，這是智的運用。但祇有判斷是非的智力和行善的力量而無仁愛的心腸，便不會進一步而設法，拿出自己的智能和仁心去積極帮助人類，愛護生物；不然，見義不為便是無勇。”</p>
<p>這樣我們可以明瞭，要行善就得發揮智仁勇的精神，要做一個智仁勇的靑年，亦應履行我們助人的誓言！</p>
<p>我們很佩服你這種求知的態度，盼你常和我們通信。請了，敬祝　進步！</p>

<h3>寫在“一二八”五週紀念的前面</h3>
<p>— 大孩子</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們。我想你們總不曾忘記了五年以前的此時吧，那時，一個很繁榮而認為全國工商業樞紐的大上海，給橫衝直撞的幾乎完全燬滅。富時雖然仗着了我們的勇士去冒死和敵人搏門，使他們受了很重的打擊，然而最後還是我們吃了很大的虧。現在，那殘酷的一幕，過去的時間雖不能說長久，也不好算如何短促，但是我們如果高興走到閘北或虹口去巡禮一回的話，那永遠不能磨滅的回憶就會浮上了腦膜；到處殘壁，一片荒涼，徒然增加了憑吊者的悲傷時間伴着一切憂鬱，一切快樂，一切悲哀，一切興奮走了過去，它同時也帶走了人們的一切記憶：那些慘痛的印象，於是也漸漸地開始在人們的心上淡薄起來了。一週年，二週年，三週年，四週年，五週年，…………甚至十週年，我相信血的紀念日子，也會跟着時光一樣地溜走的。由貼標語，喊口號，出特刋，開會，演說……而，而至於靜默，——永遠靜默。</p>
<p>如今東四省失陷已經整整地五年多了，可是五年來不但失土未復，國恥未雪，而且國難的嚴重更較甚於往昔，不過現在幸喜我全國已經統一，安內攘外已是其時，我們深信我當局執政諸公，必有縝密周詳的救國策略和復興計劃的推進。</p>
<p>一二八紀念已經五度來臨了，今天雖不是一二八，然而我却願意在這紀念日的前面來說幾句懇切的話，因為這麽一年一度的紀念果然要舉行；但是這紀念的意義我們總得明白，同時，更應該切實地負起一點救國愛國的責任來，希望大家合力同心的去收回一切失地，洗雪一切國恥，化國難為國祚。</p>
<p>上海是一個物質文明的大都會，然而我們要記得五年以前的上海是怎樣的，五年以後的上海又是怎樣的，假使一二八之役沒有我們忠勇的健兒來抗戰，那今日的上海更將是怎樣一副面目？</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友，現在是弱肉强食的世界，我們要保存五千年來的祖國，我們的民族要在未來的世界上生存，那麽只有大家起來精誠團結！</p>
<p>記得吧！踏著先烈的血跡走去！</p>
<h3>義（一）</h3>
<p>— 靑</p>
<p>全世界一部義俠史中，常有可歌可泣的事蹟，其中每有出之以自然，而最足動人觀感，要算是海軍軍艦中一般艦長的所為，他們簡直有一個固定的慣例，倘在海上發生了什麽意外的事情，無論起火或觸礁等等，做艦長的總得讓全艦的人一齊離開之後，方始離開。在這千鈞一發的生死關頭，他的性命是完全不放在心上的，會有好多勇敢的義士，就這樣視死如歸的犧牲了他們的性命，這一種義烈之氣常存于天地之間，永永不朽。</p>
<p>紐芬蘭沿海一帶，是非常危險的所在，因為海灣川流中有熱水衝來，所以水面上常常騰着濃密的霧氣。這種熱流是發源于赤道，和北極的寒流五相混合，才給成了這種蒸發的氣氛，有時濃密得連晝夜都分不出來，任是一臂之外的一切東西，也瞧不清楚，而人們要是從這霧氣以外瞧來，彷彿是一大片堆滿着皚皚白雪的山巖。</p>
<p>一千八百二十二年六月二十日早上，就在這樣一片可怕的大霧中，有一艘縱帆式的帆船“德萊克”號，忽然撞在一塊礁石上，船身立刻傾側在一面，海浪也就立刻衝上船來。船長倍格命令水手們趕快截去桅檣，希望减輕船上的重量，而使船身回復原狀，可是一些兒也沒有用。一艘救生船早被海浪捲去了，另有一艘剛放下海去，不道就翻了一個身，末了就剩下最小的一艘，是專給艦長用的。這帆船是快要破裂而沉沒了，水手們唯一的希望就是要達到一塊小礁石上，那石尖聳在海面，遠遠地可以瞧見，雖是在霧中不能估定它的大小，只消不要太大就好了。船上有一個水手，名喚藍那德的，搶到了一根繩子，撲的跳到海中，無奈那急流的水力太猛烈了，却把他衝到了對方去，大家連忙將他依舊拉到船上來。于是另有一個名喚端納的船員，自告奮勇，搭了那最後的一艘小救生船前去，身上牢縛着一根繩子。水手們歡呼着送這勇敢的船員，冒險出發，一面都吊住了船上的繩子，不敢放手，因為一陣陣的海浪猛擊着船身，似乎要將它擊成粉碎。他們很懇切的眼瞧着端納拏船前進，離開那礁石只有幾尺了。一霎時間，忽又捲來一個大浪，把那小船衝得高高的，然後摔將下來，落在礁石上，打得分碎；幸而端納並未送命，他還是緊緊地抓住了繩子，向石上爬去。</p>

<h3>潄口刷牙</h3>
<p>— （承明）</p>
<p>小朋友：你們每天早起和飯後，必須漱口，刷牙，這二種有益於衛生的事情，萬萬不可忽略而忘掉的呢！因為漱口和刷牙，非但能使口腔的清爽，牙齒的潔白，而且可能避免牙齒的疾病，不致咀嚼食物的艱難，妨礙胃腸的消化了，所以我們對於口腔的清潔，應當特別注意到平時的漱口和刷牙。</p>
<p>牙齒的原質，是燐酸鈣和炭酸鈣的成分為多，因為燐酸鈣，遇着了酸的東西，就容易溶解的，那末平常在食物的時候，所留口腔裏的食物屑，很容易變成酸臭的東西，為牙齒的大敵，假如牙齒出了毛病，那就要妨礙咀嚼，對於胃腸的消化，也要發生問題了。</p>

<h3>我國民族工業的危機</h3>
<p>— 韋里</p>
<p>近年來的中國工業，始終是處在衰落和破產的狀態中的，由於世經濟恐慌浪潮的襲擊，國際資本帝國主義殘酷的進攻，以及天災人禍的流行，使歐戰期間所建立起來的脆弱的民族工業的基礎，遭受到異常的破壞和動搖。</p>
<p>在最近的一個時期中，我們不斷的看見華商工廠的倒閉和拍賣，至於停工减工的事件，更是層出不窮，反之，帝國主義却在我國境內盡力擴張他們的勢力，給我們以很大的打擊。</p>
<p>不信，我們就不妨將現階段的幾種重要的民族工業拿來檢討一下吧。</p>
<p>先拿我們民族工業中最重要的棉紗業來說。我們知道，棉紗業是我們民族工業的中心，也可以說是我國工業中最重要的一個部門。但這個部門在現階段却是處在一個極度衰落的地位。原來，在中國的紗廠是中英日三國的勢力，據前年度的調查，中國資本的紗廠計九十六個，日本的計四十四個，英國的四個。在紗錠方面，中國佔百分之五七，日本佔百分之三九，英國佔百分之四。但是，一年來，中國紗廠却大量的倒閉，據八月十六日中華日報所載，迄至當時為止，全國著名紗廠之倒閉者，計上海八家，天津四家，無錫，南通，共四家，濟南，靑島，漢口，各一家，共達十九家之多。此外如减工停工，改組拍賣更是常有的事。據申報週刋載，全國二百七十餘萬枚紗錠中，有百分之三一•五在停工中，百分之十二•四已實行减工，百分之一卽將减工。</p>
<p>同時，華北我國的六大紗廠，有四廠已被日人收，買餘下兩廠亦時有被收買的消息。反之，在這個時候，日人却以大量資本盡力擴充其在華的工廠，在天津方面，日人新增八十萬紗錠，青島上海亦同時擴充，而通州又新設一廠。今後日人的錠數將增至四百萬枚左右，而我們的錠數却仍是二百七十餘萬，兩相比較，這是如何的值得注意。</p>
<p>再就絲廠方面來說，我們知道，繅絲工業本是我國最重要的一種工業，可是近年來却幾乎完全體了。因為海外市塲與原料的兩重關係，使牠的工作在時作時輟的狀熊中。去年上期，因江浙二春繭豐收，故各絲廠都先後開工。但秋繭收成却異常不好，再加以大繭商的壟斷居奇，故原料來大感缺乏，自十一月初起，上海和江浙等處之停工者共達三十餘家，而存繭僅能維持至年底，春繭上市以前，各廠都是無法工作的。</p>
<p>此外，大批人造絲的走私，與海外市塲上別人的傾銷競爭，更使我國的絲業陷於苦境。</p>
<p>除了棉紗和繅絲而外，麵粉業該是我國一個重要的民族工業了，但這個工業部門也是非常不景氣。最近以來，麵粉的市價大漲，而去年我國小麥的收成亦告豐牧，宜乎麵粉業可以大大的發展了但是在事實上却大謬不然。年來我國麵粉業之最感困難的問題是原料問題，往往因為原料不濟或外麥價飛漲，致使工作大受影響。去年我國小麥確是豐收，據中央農業試騐所的估計，全國小麥產較上年增收四九八○六四○○○市担，大麥收成為一七○四八二○○○市担，較上年增收百分八。雖這個數目仍不能供國內麵粉廠的應用，但比較前兩年總算好許多了。可是，豐收却仍然不能我們享受，享受這豐收的乃是我們的友邦。由于友邦在華北各地對糧食的大量搜購，致使原料來缺乏，而價格也隨之飛漲，結果各廠不得不相率减工，“如福新，阜豐，裕興等廠，莫不在减工時作時輟之狀態中。去年九月上海各廠已减少三成車數，十月份减少四成，以後停工者亦不在少。因之，麵粉業仍然是危機四伏的。</p>

<p>此外，如捲烟業，水泥工業，火柴業，火酒業等，雖然比較過去略有進步，在絕對的意義上說來，牠已經有相當的成績，但是在相對的意義上說來，却仍然要重新加以檢討纔對的。</p>
<p>從歐洲大戰期間，經過千辛萬苦所掙扎出來的民族工業，現在仍然處在一個異常困難的地位，雖然我們僅只舉出棉紗，繅紗，麵粉來說，但就是這三個部門，已儘可代表我們的民族工業了。</p>
<p>為甚麽我們的民族工業會遭受到這種危機呢？我以為最主要的原因不外乎下列幾點</p>
<p>第一，因為東北數省的失掉和別人對華北的控制，使我們民族工業的廣大市塲受到很大的影響。九一八以前，東北數省是我們工業品的重要市塲，但現在却無法利用了。</p>
<p>第二，因為國際資本帝國主義的侵略，特別是友邦的走私，使我們的工業大受打擊。據海關的估計，去年一月至五月的五個月中，單是人造絲，香烟紙及糖類的私運，合計不下三○五○○○○○金單位之巨，單是四月一月的關稅損失，便達八百萬元，這種走私的貨品，正如像洪水一樣的向各處泛濫，牠當然要使我國的工業遭受損失的。</p>
<p>第三，我們的民族工業在目前還不夠合理化，牠的組織，原料的供給，產銷的調劑，都還缺乏整個的計劃，因之不免要感受影響。</p>
<h3>北極光</h3>
<p>— 彦祥</p>
<p>居住在都市裏的人羣是很少注意到大自然的夜景的，因為他們已被街燈和商標的五光十色所炫耀。但那居住在鄕村的人，却可欣賞這無上的美麗的夜景了。如果你到了俄國的極北部，挪威的海岸，坎拿大的某些地方，那你更可以發見許多從未見過的光輝。這些光輝就呌做“北極光”。自然，南極和北極一標，也有着“南極光”的，只因為南極很少陸地，無人觀察出來，所以這兒只談談北極光。</p>
<p>距離地球磁軸較近的地方都可以看見北極光，而地球磁軸又是與地球面相交於北磁極的，這北磁極則在坎拿大的波夏島上，所以在該島上是探看北極光最適宜的地方。</p>
<p>北極光的形狀主要的有三種，卽拱狀，幃幔狀，和長的流綫狀，牠的色澤通常都是嫩綠和嫩黃，但有時也滲雜點紅色及紫色，十分美麗。極光初現的時候是一個恬淡而皎潔的圓拱，頂端稍稍偏在正北的西面幾度。一轉瞬間，光芒四射，好似探海燈一樣的明亮。這光芒繼續地演變，并且不停地顫動閃灼。在當地的土人還以為這是他們祖先的靈魂的光照呢。有時北極光直立如幃幔，幃幔的褶痕却時時改變形狀。這確是一種富有迷惑性的奇觀。</p>
<p>北極光的高度，據斯托曼在挪威的測量，是離地百六十哩。有時那“流綫極光”的頂部可高出地表二百五十哩，并且我們相信那極光的底部最低也得高出地面四十哩。旛頂的高度，最高的紀錄為一千公里（六百哩以上）。</p>
<p>有幾個測量極光的人，其中有幾位說，他們曾親自聽到過北極光有聲浪發出，而且異常清晰，有的說這聲浪好像綢製的酒旗迎風飄蕩時的呼呼之聲，有的說這聲浪好像鋒利的刀口在空氣中急流旋進時的擦擦之聲，又有的說這聲浪好像船舶上的轆轤被風吹動時的呌嘯聲。這就呌作“極光的聲音”。然而根據學理的研究，這聲音是不可能的。因為極光每每是在六十哩以外的高空，而音的速度每行一哩則需五秒鐘，那麽六十哩的距離就要走五分鐘才能達到地面，連雷聲和電光這兩者達到人的感官上都不符合，那極光之光與音更不符合了。還有，極光所在的高空，空氣是那樣的稀薄，其聲浪又怎能有節奏地連續傳進人的耳鼓呢？所以主張有“極光的聲音”的說法還是一個疑問。</p>
<p>極光的組織成分又是些甚麽氣體呢？極光的光譜已用照相攝取了下來，證明其中所含的成分大部份是氮氣。氮氣佔空氣中的主要成分，而在這高空中也還是一樣。極光的光譜中也含有那著名的綠色“光帶經”，這現象是因為氧氣的激增，或是因為氧氣在一種極為活躍的階段裏。其他如氖，　，　，等，在這高空也有很少的成分，而這成分很少的各氣體是極足以增加極光之色彩的。</p>
<p>極光與磁性很有關係。如果電子從太陽上面射到地球上面來，她們將穿過空間，被地球的磁塲所吸引，直等到牠們過到南磁極或北磁極左近的高空中，便呈現着螺旋狀的圜，繞着“磁力綫”。由螺旋而前進的電子，向一個方向漸次聚集在北磁極的左近，因離化而增强，便產生了北極光。同樣，趨向南極的便成了南極光。不過南極光和北極光是否同時出現，這在現在還沒有研究到。</p>
<p>從太陽射來的質點有帶正電的，有帶負電的，有中性的，其放射的方式則有電子，正子，中子等。而這些帶電的質點則有向地球南北兩極前進的可能。</p>
<p>當北極光出現後，很多人相信天氣是漸漸變壞了，這就好像有許多人相信月亮和天氣有關一樣。其實在同一時間內各個不同的地方，是可以看到各種不同的天氣的。能看見極光的區域也很廣，其各地的天氣自然也各有不同，而且那極光又是高懸在五十至六十哩的高空，而影響天氣的領空最高尚不及十哩，最高的卷雲很少超出六哩。不過有一點倒是值得注意的，要在天晴才看得見北極光，天陰或天雨便看不見，這是因為被雲霧遮住了的緣故。</p>
<p>現在用來探測高空的方法也非常的多了。有用氣球的，把氣球高升天空，讓其自行破裂，降落地上，就可測知氣球所到的空中，其高度為何，溫度為何，濕度為何。其次是用探海燈，可以把高空中的光聚集起來，由光的分析可以斷定空中所含有的各種氣體。此外還有用無綫電波的，播放無綫電波於空中，瞬間便反應轉來，由此也可測知高空的情形。有了這等方法的帮助，對於北極光的研究將來當會更加精確而豐富的</p>
<h3>評“雷雨”</h3>
<p>— 達巓</p>
<p>中國有句俗話，所謂“新罎子里裝老酒”，這句俗話用來評雷雨話劇，我覺得再恰當也沒有的了。</p>
<p>雷雨劇本出世以後，出演不下數十次，過去因為劇情的複雜，內中的角色側重表情，在一些沒有深長戲劇修養的演員演出，都是吃力而不易討好的；自中國旅行劇團出演後，才轟動了一時，每次演來，生意都非常好，這的確是中國旅行劇團幾位職業演員演技老練純熟的成功；而雷雨四幕劇的本身，也因為中國旅行劇團的表演，而博得好評了。</p>
<p>在我們這一大混亂的時代，我們這一新舊大搏鬥的時代，一些鈍覺的人正在摸索着生路，同時在生路的前進路程中，又像似發現了將要毀滅的暗影，他們生底勇氣抵不住毀滅底恐懼；可是，我們終究是生的，也就是必須要處理我們底生活。換句話說：在這種矛盾的環境中，我們底感覺是遲鈍的，停滯的，膚淺的，空虛的與游離的；唯一安慰我們的就是强烈的不切實際的刺㦸。舊劇中的“火燒紅蓮寺”與“封神榜”等神怪故事旣成了我們這一時代中下階級底慰藉品，那末“雷雨”等類的話劇，成了我們這一時代底一般小市民—尤其是在思想上稱為“放足階級”的—及知識階級底慰藉品，那是不足為怪的了。</p>
<p>但，“雷雨”之能呌座的另一理由，還是因為劇作者底手法精巧，用新的外衣裏藏記舊的內容，用一般觀客正需要的刺㦸來誘導觀客們底情感。</p>
<p>“雷雨”雖然是四幕劇，演出的時間需要四個多鐘頭，演員十餘人，塲面數十塲，但是內容却非常簡略而又平凡的。並且因為作者所要發揚的主題像似抱着廻避的態度，而這廻避的態度又是二重性的，結果便把主題混亂了；然這種混亂才是作者底聰明手法，但所給與觀客們的效果恐怕是作者所料不到的，而同時也就是作者所沒有打算料到的；作者所採取的素材的確是一件新奇而又驚人的故事，可是作者沒有發展它，而且有意地抑止它底發展，只是把它造成了一個死板的，靜止的故事。所以，不管觀客對着那些有强烈刺㦸的塲面如何在流淚或狂笑，那也不過是一種淺薄刺㦸而已，他們和她們對於主題并沒有了解，因為根本就抓不住主題。可是中國旅行劇團演出“雷雨”時生意之所以能那樣好，正是那幾幕能使觀客流淚與狂笑的强烈刺㦸塲面的效果，以呌座的立塲說來，作者底劇本是適於職業劇團的。</p>
<p>劇情是這樣：有一個鑛主周樸園，到德國留過學，在靑年時代和他家一個丫頭呌侍萍的發生了戀愛（照劇情說來，把牠呌做“私通”還恰當些），可是，一直到生了第二個兒子後，因為周家給周樸園另娶，竟把她趕出去（這都由魯侍萍口中說出來的，劇中並沒有表演）。侍萍抱着個才生下三天而又生病的嬰兒，被逐後竟去跳河尋死。這大槪是“天意”吧？偏偏就遇到了“慈善家”把她和嬰兒都救活了；這大概又得到了“神佑”吧？產婦和嬰兒不但沒有死，而且也沒有害什麽病。以後，侍萍又嫁了兩回人，最後一個呌魯貴，孩子長大了呌魯大海，這一輾轉二十年期間，周樸園底後妻周繁漪和前妻侍萍底兒子周萍竟發生了戀愛（這是說“私通”好些）。眞是“無巧不成書”，這時魯貴又當了周家底僕人，魯貴又把他和侍萍生的女兒四鳳薦到了周家來當大姐；大少爺周萍見了四鳳年靑，又愛上四鳳，竟發生肉體關係，懷了三個月胎。周萍有了四鳳當然對繁漪冷淡起來，那繁漪對四鳳的嫉妒也是必然的了。等到四鳳底母親由他處歸來，繁漪約她來談，意思想呌她把眼中釘的四鳳領回去。眞是巧得很，這時魯大海正在周樸園底鑛山上做工，因為罷工問題被推為代表，來周家向周樸園交涉，同時侍萍來周家又正遇到了周樸園，於是眞相大白，周樸園乃把魯貴及四鳳辭退。但周萍對四鳳熱情不死，是夜冒了風雨往魯家會四鳳，偏偏被魯大海撞見，周萍偕四鳳逃回家去，侍萍及大海也趕了來，侍萍這時雖知周萍與四鳳的血統關係，但仍忍住內心之痛苦使彼等偕逃，適繁漪趕來，欲道出伊與周萍之關係而加以阻止，在這種混亂的塲面上，周樸園也被驚了起來，當着周萍說明魯侍萍卽伊之生母時，四鳳卽搶門而出，去觸了走雷的電綫而死，周萍用槍自殺，繁漪及侍萍皆受驚成瘋。這樣，這一段罵人的故事就用了“報應昭彰”的字段給結束</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>驟然看來，作者底胆子的確大得可怕；可是，因了作者底技巧，一點點地又把這一個怕人的故事給化成一個奧妙的，合乎“人情”的，同時也合乎“天理”與“道德”“良心”的傳奇故事了。</p>
<p>這劇中所出現的人物，不但有私通後母的“逆子”，而且還有反抗丈夫壓迫的妒婦，甚至於還有罷工工人的代表，和高談平等想要化除階級觀念的周冲，以及欺騙母親的四鳳；這些叛亂的危險份子，作者都把他們和她們用“和平手段給處置了。</p>
<p>四鳳曾發過誓，否認和周家底少爺們有過“瓜葛”，在戶外雷聲隆隆中，她跪在母親的面前說：“我如果騙你，我受雷擊！”可知“天理”是有定數。呵！雖然當時或者周家房子上有“避雷針”的設備吧？用“雷擊”是反科學的，可是作者早已放下了伏綫，預先從繁漪底口中引出了電桿倒下了的對白；所以，四鳳抱電綫而死，不但“發了誓”，而且同時又不違反科學。同樣，周萍這個“逆子”本當受“天譴”用“雷擊的，但結果却用手槍自殺了：這也很合理，因為手槍原是“五雷”之一呀！</p>
<p>魯大海是一個工人，竟敢滿口“平等”的來向周樸園交涉，且還很强暴，但因作者想用自己丟棄的兒子來搗自己的蛋，以示“報應”，所以大海對於工人自己的事在樸園欺騙之下也就馬虎下去了。大海知道自己是窮人，自己的妹妹不應當嫁給富人周萍，甚至動刀動槍地來反對，可是最後為了妹妹底“貞操”和“一女不嫁二夫”的道德，也就馬馬虎虎地答應了，甚至於反乎前情，反催促他底母親答應。作者底意思是說，貧富并不是不能相容的，工人也是有“道德”的。</p>
<p>周冲（樸園次子）對於舊道德有些歧視，所以也同四鳳一同觸電而死，以免後來的危險。至於“妒婦”與“蕩婦”的繁漪，當然也為我們這一社會所不齒的，發瘟而死是她應得底“報應”。</p>
<p>作者底技巧是精妙的！</p>
<p>新罎子里裝老酒，罎子雖然時溪漂亮，但酒味終究是老酒底味道！</p>
<h3>被侵略的世界巨人</h3>
<p>— 高家幼</p>
<p>這裏所說的世界巨人，並不是在國際上大出風頭的什麽怪傑，而是生存於現今“文明世界”的一個角落裏的巨人種；這是首先應該弄淸楚的。</p>
<p>據最先旅行世界，周的馬扎蘭說，當他與其同行者乘船人馬扎蘭海峽的數日之前，有一天在南美南端近東海岸上陸，發見了砂地上有巨大的人類的脚跡：但那時他們因為很感恐怖，不敢出去，所以終於沒有見到那巨大的土人的姿態，只是順便把他呌做大脚人。後來由於歐人的探險，才知道了這種大脚人更是世界的巨人種。這巨人種的身長，據說有七英尺！歐人稱他們為帕達果央人，他們自稱為左勒加，卽他們的語言的“人類”之意。</p>
<p>這著名的世界巨人種本來是住在南美的沃士拉普拉達平原的，在十六世紀後因為受到侵入的拉丁民族的壓迫，才漸漸南下，以南緯三十六度以南的安德斯山脈與大西洋之間的草原彭巴為居留地，卽現在他們住的地方。說到他們的形狀，也與別的人種略有不同：他們的頭較長，臉面很大，眉毛和鬍鬚都很稀少，睜着黑的眼睛，披着黑的頭髪，半裸着身體，看來眞有點可怕。關於他們的起源，現在還沒有明確的答案。有人說，從南美古代文化乃至人種方面看來，他們的起源大體與太平洋諸島有關係，但不管怎樣，這巨人種的來源還是有待於學者之繼續研究的。</p>
<p>巨人種的生活是以狩獵為主。現在他們已有了馬匹，打獵和行走大都利用馬力，馬可說是他們最主要的生活工具。但在百五十六年以前，這地方還沒有馬匹，那時他們要行走草原，要追趕野獸，都只能依靠他們那雙結實壯健的脚他們的人數本來很多，只是因為“文明的”白人的迫害，因為惡劣氣候和風土的進攻，現在大概只有幾萬人了。</p>
<p>因為生活還是原始的，所以巨人們並不知道什麽上帝耶穌，也不知道釋迦牟尼，卽是說他們並沒有現代流行的宗敎信仰。他們所信仰的是精靈，是善惡兩種精靈。據他們說，善良的精靈是古人的精靈，現在它是住在山上的洞穴中，正在不斷的為他們祝福；同時這種精靈還使他們生活所必要的羊和駱駝以及駝鳥等物不斷繁殖起來，並使他們能捕獲這些東西。至於另一的惡的精靈，則是在善良精靈睡眠時出來，使那些不祥動物狐與狼等活動，為害他們。</p>
<p>他們對於那惡的精靈非常恐怖，每天部落的戰士們在太陽出來之前，便要燃着火把，從他們的天幕之後追出惡魔。有時戰士們還要跨在馬上，舞着火把，大聲急呼，將那惡的精靈追趕到深遠的地方去。</p>
<p>帕達果央地方吹着很强烈的西風，所以巨人們特向東建立天幕。這地方的中心有細長的小道，用以作部落的工作連絡。現在，他們已有了若干牛羊，但這是最近的事，以前他們並沒有馬和其他的家畜，還是純粹的狩獵民族。他們所能作的，主要是獸皮幕和披衫：他們沒有鈔票洋錢，也沒有近代的貿易知識，而是行的物物交易。這地方特產的駝烏羽毛是白人所最喜歡的物品，當有許多歐美人携來“文化商品”與巨人們交換。這也許可以說就是他們的“國際貿易”吧。</p>
<p>巨人們狩獵時所用的武器，是他們所獨有的巧妙的飛石。當行狩獵的一天，卽由世襲的會長指定四十人參加。這些參加的人在前一夜就要各自裝好馬鞍，把一切準備完善，在一定時間齊集於指定的塲所，好像出征的兵似的。最有趣的，是出發狩獵時，他們都要帶食糧，都要準備一把鹽放在腰間。依照他們的習慣，在出發狩獵的早晨什麽東西也不要吃，必要在獲得野物時才吃東西。如果是在夜間，就舉烟火來通知一切，那情形使我們實際地明白了原始通信的狀况，明白了通信的起源是如何的。</p>
<p>帕達果央地方是世界最惡劣的塲所之一，住在這兒的巨人當然沒有什麽樂趣可言。但有一點却是他們自以為幸福的，卽是這裏的野獸野鳥很多，他們的衣食都可不成問題。同時，他們自己雖未享“文明”的幸福，但對於現實的生活倒很相安，性情也是天眞爛漫的，實際上並沒有什麽野蠻氣。過去常有白人來這裏被他們危害的傳說，但那是因為白人迫害他們所引起的，並不是他們無故去危害別人現在，因為到這兒來的外人增多了，由於許多事實的證明，巨人們對於一般人類實是本性上就很相愛的。例如到這裏來的白人，有許多地方都需要他們帮助，他們也很高興地帮助着別人，並不要一點報酬，這便是文明人所辦不到的。但是，假如你不自重，認他們為野蠻人，而且欺侮和迫害他們，那他們的巨大的拳頭就也會對你不起的。</p>
<p>善良的巨人們過着安靜平穩的畫一般的生活，他們未受什麽權力的支配和壓迫，彼此都平等自由地過活着：在他們的生活中投下了暗影的，只有到這裏來經商的“文明人”那些“文明人”常常將劣等的麥酒運到這地方來胡亂售賣，有時甚至以一兩杯麥酒卽騙去了巨人們美好的皮披衫和漂亮的馬匹，使他們自己的穿用都發生問題。假使巨人們的一切是代表原始民族的，到這裏來經商的“文明人”的一切是代表現代的，那我們便要請問讀者諸君：人類是進化了呢？還是在退化呢？</p>
<h3>爭正統</h3>
<p>— 丁逢白</p>
<p>在君主專制時代，君主一死，便卽刻要立新君，承繼大寶，因為“天下不可一日無君”。是之謂統承繼大統的</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>新召又應只有一個，因為一天無二日，民無二王”。是之謂正統。但是，當天下紛爭擾攘之際，“一國三公”，不是你指我為偽，便是找指你為逆，又以何者為正統呢？於是後代的史家便要給他定個孰正孰偽來。這區別正偽的標準便是看他得地之多寡，據位之久暫，是否屬於前代的血緣，是否佔據舊日的都城，是否為漢族的苗裔。不過，儘管後世的史家有所論評，事後來定以正偽。但在當時，却很難分出孰正孰偽來，而且在其“統”之下的小民，只能認統之者之為正，不敢加以分辦的。</p>
<p>由皇帝爭皇位的正統又到了學術界文化界的爭道統的正統。這也是“古已育之”。不說遠了，就說清朝的桐城派和陽湖派也都各承衣缽，各有道統，你說我偽，我說你逆。直至今日也還有“學有師傳，遵宗某家”，“或承古文，或繼今文”之口號。加之自來又是“文人相輕”，所以正統之爭甚至較君位之爭尤烈。他們很多都如爭君位的正統一樣，不一定就是爭的某人或某派的學術文章的正統，而大都是自詡他與他所宗者的關係之密切，因而便自許為某人或某派之正統。比如自以為係桐城派嫡系的戴存莊，就說過“我生望溪海峯之鄕，不敢不以古文自任”的話。因為是同鄕關係，便得承繼正統。其他如因為有父子關係，甥舅關係，岳婿關係而自稱為正統的，則更指不勝屈。於是學術文章之正統也成了君位承繼之正統了。</p>
<p>魯迅先生的學術文章，用不着我們再來推崇了；自然我們也界望後進青年學他的精神，學他的文章，把這承繼下去。但是，如魯迅先生在生時所諷刺的，他是决不願意人家把他當着“統”來爭的，他自己也沒有認為自己就有“統”。然而，他一去世以後，爭道統的人，爭正統的人，可就不少了。</p>
<p>許廣平女士與魯迅兆平夫人之爭魯先生的正統，這為的是版稅某老板和某某書局各自推戴一二位文人來爭編魯迅全集，這為的是生意。但是有些青年作家之爭着捧靈柩，當司儀，爭着當送葬時的總指揮，這又為的是甚麽呢？還有，我們從許廣平女士和內山完造的紀念魯迅的文字中，似乎沒有看見一個青年作家每朝每日都在侍候着將逝世的魯迅，由各青年作家自己的紀念文中也只見着他們都是魯迅已逝世後才去看他的，那麽為甚麽魯迅一死，便爭着要把他搶過來抱在自己讓裏，裝着“我死了父親也從未像這樣流過淚”，對人說話的時候也裝着嗚咽不能成聲的樣兒呢？旣然這樣悲哀，那末又有什麽力氣，精神來爭總指揮，甚至要鬧到要全武行呢？這同那皇帝死了多時，屍蟲已經出戶，而皇子皇孫因為爭皇位，不去安葬，有何分別？未必這樣一爭，如果爭勝了，當了總指揮，那鉭迅先生的大寶便為你一人所奪去，便可“挾天子以令諸侯”，來指揮一切的文人，作家，復掌“文壇老將”之旗，復登“文壇盟主”之極罷？</p>
<p>還有，他們能夠時常去拜會魯先生，親近先生之道範，同先生談話，而且又能親自捧先生之靈柩，能作總指揮，甚至能編魯先生全集，還是多麽大的幸事呵！眞是“中華民國四萬萬人中最幸福的幾個青年”！比受耶穌的親自摩頂洗禮還要幸福！</p>
<p>但是這同承繼魯迅先生的精神和學問又有甚麽關係呢？在魯迅的遺囑上不是明明寫着“各人管自己的生活”，那裏在呌你們來爭正統？</p>
<p>現在且引魯迅先生的幾句話來作結束：</p>
<p>“文人的遭殃，不在生前的被政聲和被冷落，一溟之後，言行兩亡，於是無聊之徒，謬託知己，是非蠭起，旣以自衛，又以賣錢，連死屍也成了他們的沽名權利之具，這倒是值得悲哀的。”（憶韋素園君）</p>
<h3>抗戰與備戰問題</h3>
<p>— 陸敬之</p>
<p>凡受了侵略必須抗戰，中國現在需要抗戰，並且在它簡直成為一個時代，換句話說中國正入抗戰時代去了，——這一切都是眞理，除開漢奸以外，沒有人加以否認。所以抗議是普遍的主張。</p>
<p>但若進一步問：抗戰底時機以現在為好呢抑將來為好？抗戰底進行採取局部的方式呢抑全國的方式？……各人底答案便不相同了。這種差異，爭論得最激烈的，是有準備的抗戰與無準備的抗戰兩個主張。</p>
<p>依有準備的抗戰之說，中國底武器不如人，現在若打，必然失敗，所以要做一個準備工作，把力量弄充足了，而後勝算可操、反對此說的人，則稱它為“唯武韶論”說這是漢奸底思想。依他，中國應該立刻抗戰，不要準備，這可以名為無準備的抗戰之說。</p>
<p>我對于這兩種見解，覺得後一種底錯誤較多，很顯然的，它是感情的抗戰論，盲動的抗戰論，無計劃的抗戰論，它把唯武器論與漢奸思想分辯不清楚，而失之意氣用事。所以贊成它的大半是青年的小市民。這並不因為它底眞理性充分，而因為它自身根本是小市民底意識，合乎青年人底脾胃。</p>
<p>試想想：抗戰是一件大事，關係於民族底存亡，怎不該考慮？怎不該凖備？怎不該有全盤計劃？理智在這裏是絕對必需的。從事實上看，中國一切都趕不上它底敵人。單以武器來說，恩格斯底“手槍戰勝實劍”的話如果是眞理，那末中國應該凖備武器不是很明白的道理嗎？</p>
<p>抗戰需要武器。沒有武器，怎能抗戰？主張以赤手空拳去抵禦飛機大砲，乃是夢想以單純的勇敢去應付犀利的器械，這在哲學上是觀念論的，並不正確。其反對恩格斯，則很顯然。這在事實上一定失敗，絕沒有戰勝敵人之可能。抗戰底　的如果是　服敵人，求得勝利，那我們不應該反對凖備，而應該主張凖備。</p>
<p>因此，我覺得一個眞正抗戰的人對於武器要抱這樣的態度：槍砲愈新愈好；飛機愈多愈好；堡壘愈堅愈好；壯丁愈訓練愈好；子彈愈堆積愈好；………。作戰固需要勇敢，但也需要武器。只有把勇敢與武器統一起來，而後纔能殺敵致果，獲得勝利。</p>
<p>所以我們對於“唯武器論”的批評，不能站在反對武器或輕視武器的觀點上，而應該指出它底褊狹性來。這就是說它只知道武器底凖備，不知道武器以外的其他凖備，如經濟，政治，敎育，文化，外交等等。它不知道現代底戰爭不是單純的軍事問題而是整個國力底地較。在這裏，我們應該主張大規模的凖備。眞正的抗戰要求充分備戰。所以抗戰與備戰是不相衝突的。</p>
<p>所以把抗戰與備戰分離，對立，在備戰之外主張抗戰，是兒戲抗戰。不然，就是以左傾空談來欺騙人，或者把中國底命運付諸孤注之一擲。這樣的抗戰論，是不負責任的，只有頭腦簡單的人，沒有經騐的人，藉抗戰以圖政治上之收獲的人纔曾相信。正確的抗戰論是與備戰論統一的。</p>
<p>簡單的抗戰論者說道：你凖備，敵人獨不凖備嗎？而且他底生產發達，稅收很多，凖備得比你更好，所以你永遠都不及他，凖備何用？這是很有理出的，對於那夢想把我們底寶劍與敵人底手槍之比變成大砲與手槍之比的備戰論者說來，不當一當頭棒喝。</p>
<p>但我底備戰論則不然。對於武器只能盡量凖備，初不必一定要把寶劍與手槍之比變成大砲與手槍之比。從我們與敵人的經濟能力看來，只要辦到手槍少與手槍多之比就夠了。因為勝負底决定不全在武器。有了相當武器，再加之其它優於敵人的條件，就勝算可操了。所以凖備武器的思想只應該是把相差太遠的距離縮短一點</p>
<p>同時，我以為備戰不應放棄必要的抗戰。這就是說，在備戰未達到我們底最低限度時，如果必須抗戰的，應卽刻抗戰。對於不能有勝利把握的抗戰，當然可以避免。如不能避免而又非抗戰不可，那亦應卽刻抗戰。所以備戰不是在抗戰之外備戰，而是與抗戰統一的。不必抗戰時就備戰；必抗戰時就抗戰。</p>
<p>單純的備戰論也有錯誤。它把抗戰與備戰劃分得太明白，以為我們某個時期備戰，某個時期抗戰。在備戰時期只能備戰，要在抗戰時期纔能抗戰。殊不知敵人底侵略不依照我們底計劃。如果在備戰時期中來侵略時，我們徒然備戰，不問應否抵抗，槪以凖備未充對，那就顯然犯了不可救藥的錯誤，必貽患於未來。所以單能的備戰論是不對的。</p>
<p>因此，有些抗戰論者——單純的抗戰論者，把備戰認不戰，也有原因。但他們把單純的備戰論看成不戰論，亦欠正確。他們底理由是我市民不抗戰，治者不抗戰。其實，他一點也不知道抗戰是保衛財產，保衛政權。因此，凡有財產者，凡有政權者，都要抗戰。你不見滿清貴族抗戰了幾十年嗎？難道中英之戰，中法之戰，英法聯軍之戰，中日之戰，八國聯軍之戰，還是假的嗎？卽使你健志，記憶不得這些歷史，那末，難道阿皇底抗戰，還會博得你底同情的，也忘記了嗎？任何一種有財產者或有政權者，抗戰不到盡頭是不會投降的。所以市民不抗戰，治者不抗戰之說沒有理由。備戰的人就是抗戰的人。他底錯誤不在於不戰，在於單純備戰，卽形而上學地把備戰與抗戰分離了。</p>
<p>自然，說治者不抗戰，也不單是把備戰看作不戰，還有別的事實作根據。這就是人所共知的妥協。這些妥協在近幾年很多，我相信沒有人會滿意的。但我覺得我們不能因此就得出治者不抗戰的結論。一切治者有保衛政權的本性，不祇抗到盡頭决不投降。中國則還未有正式的抵抗，更談不上盡頭，怎能說他就不抗戰呢？妥協之來，我以為是由於策略——他底整個打算。任何人都懂得主張抗戰不過以抗戰為總的路綫而已；但這路綫不是直的而是曲的，因此並不就不可妥協，假如抗戰時機不利於也，或某種凖備來不及，有延緩的必要，都可出之以妥協。倘然分析政治的人竟把暫時的妥協看作永久的妥協，那就犯了以現象忽略本質的錯誤，並不正確。</p>
<p>這裏，我們必須要知道抗戰論者不應該是一個好戰論者。這就是說，他不問抗戰是否必要，可否為了充分的凖備而暫時避免抗戰，只是一味抗戰，動輒抗戰。這樣的抗戰論必然是機械論的，不免有濫行抗戰之失。另一方面，我們也必須知道在總的抗戰路綫之下的妥協，不是徒然妥協，一味妥協，無限度的妥協。它是有所為，在必要時纔妥協，且有一定的限度。總之，抗戰與妥協都不是為條件的，而各所有宜。眞理是具體的，不能抽象。這是應該注意的一個槪念。</p>

<h3>The Central Government Still Hopes for Yang's Awakening</h3>
<p>Still Maintaining a Lenient Stance Towards the Shaanxi Situation / Yang's Continued Delaying Will Only Hasten His Downfall / Li Zhigang Will Return to Nanjing Soon and Then Back to Shaanxi</p>
<p>[Nanjing] News from Luoyang on the 23rd stated that Yang Hucheng and others had agreed to withdraw their troops to the Tongguan-Yinan central area of northern Wei River, and to move the Pacification Headquarters to Sanyuan, seemingly indicating remorse. Someone visited He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs, at 6 PM to inquire about the veracity of this news. He was not at his residence at the time, but his aides claimed that He had not received any official or private military reports regarding this matter today, and that the aforementioned news was definitely unreliable. The Central Government still maintains a lenient stance towards the Shaanxi situation, awaiting Yang Hucheng's awakening. Further news indicates that while the Central Government has not abandoned its lenient stance towards the Shaanxi situation, it has limitations. If Yang Hucheng can thoroughly awaken within the next few days, his past actions may be forgiven. However, if he continues to delay as a stalling tactic, he will only hasten his own downfall. Yang's representative, Li Zhigang, left Nanjing on the 21st and will return to Nanjing soon before heading back to Shaanxi. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Wang Speaks on Democratic Politics</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] At 4 PM on the 21st, the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan held a tea party at the International Fellowship Society to welcome Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Committee. Vice President Kong Yongzhi gave a speech first, mainly recounting the efforts made by colleagues from various ministries and commissions together with Wang over the past 21 years, and expressing his joy at his return to Nanjing. He said that because Wang had to abstain from certain foods after his illness, he had only prepared light tea to express his respect. Then, Wang stood up to express his gratitude and briefly recounted his recovery. He also mentioned that Chairman Chiang had concurrently served as the head of the Executive Yuan for the past year, and that colleagues from various ministries and commissions had worked diligently to improve the country, and that there had been significant progress in national defense construction, finance, and diplomacy, which he greatly admired. The general content has already been seen in various newspapers and will not be repeated here. However, a section on democratic politics was not included in the newspapers. Wang personally wrote it down, and it is now published as follows:</p>
<p>"Just now, Mr. Kong asked me to talk about my feelings during my months in Europe. I am truly ashamed, feeling that I have not made any contributions, because I have been in a sanatorium for several months, and have had very little contact with people from all walks of life in Europe, so my knowledge is not broad. If I had to say something, after the European War, many monarchical autocratic countries were overthrown, and democratic polities were built, all based on the democratic theories since the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. At that time, the general public observed that democratic politics would flourish from then on, and that democratic politics would be the ultimate in politics. Unexpectedly, the proletarian dictatorship of the Soviet Union suddenly appeared, and then Italian fascism and German National Socialism successively emerged. These two kinds of politics have different contents and forms, and their merits and demerits are not to be discussed for the time being, but no one can deny that they are opposed to democratic politics. Therefore, the general public had another feeling, thinking that democratic politics would decline in this pincer-like situation. However, aren't England and France still democratic politics? Isn't the United States still democratic politics? The Republic of China is a democratic country, and the Chinese Kuomintang is the practitioner of the Three Principles of the People. Over the years, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly said that China is not suitable for autocratic politics. China is now and will continue to move towards the road of democratic politics, which is undoubtedly true. Opponents of democratic politics list the biggest shortcomings of democratic politics, which are nothing more than the prevalence of electoral malpractice, the unreliability of decision-making, and the slow action and low efficiency of the administrative system due to the constraints of other agencies, leading to weakness, etc. In fact, the Prime Minister had already seen these shortcomings in the Three Principles of the People and had already corrected them. We are convinced that the Three Principles of the People is a principle that is most suitable for democratic politics, and it is by no means comparable to those who casually imitate the democratic political theories since the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. If democratic politics is promoted according to the Three Principles of the People, there will never be the various malpractices mentioned above. Even in the democratic politics of England, France, and the United States, although they give the people more political freedom in peacetime, the ability of the government to take measures is sometimes inevitably a little weak. However, once the country has a major change, the concentration of government power and the agility of action can be fully exerted without fear of constraints. This phenomenon was already significant during the European War. Not only should this be the case when the country is in crisis during the European War, but also in recent years, the United States has granted great power to President Roosevelt due to the economic panic, allowing him to exercise freedom. The United States is the most powerful country in the world today, and it is still the case in the face of a small crisis, let alone China, which is still in a period of adjustment and is plagued by both internal and external troubles. If there is a good government, the people trust it, allowing it to do its best to complete the plan and steps for saving the nation, which is very natural. There is also another layer. The more political freedom is given to the people in peacetime, the easier it is to cope with major changes, because the country is formed by the gathering of the people, and the political ability of the people is strong, then the strength of the country is also strengthened. It is like an army. If the soldiers are well-trained and capable on weekdays, then once something happens and they are mobilized, this army will definitely be the most brave and disciplined army. World political theories have questions about the limits of the powers of the organs, but there is no doubt about cultivating the political ability of the people. For example, in the recent Xi'an Incident, although the central government handled it properly and Mr. Chiang's sincerity was touching, the expression of national public opinion and people's will was extremely consistent and extremely serious, which was a powerful support. From this, we can see that cultivating the political ability of the people is an important principle in saving the nation. I hope that those who criticize democratic governance will not neglect this point. As for the concentration and unification of government power in order to cope with national disasters, there is no contradiction with cultivating the political ability of the people, because it is in the nature of the government and the people to depend on each other in coping with national disasters. The government is loyal to the people, and the people trust their government, which is its activity. Without the people as a foundation, neither democratic politics nor dictatorial politics can be established. For example, the Soviet Union has the proletariat as its foundation, and Italy and Germany have the majority of their working people as their foundation. These people, on the one hand, hate the violence of big capitalists, and on the other hand, hate the chaos of the Communist Party, so they sincerely support the government in order to seek rejuvenation. England, the United States, and France, etc., have various parties and factions, each representing the interests of a part of the people, and they coexist in a certain political way. Although their forms are different, they all have the same foundation of the people. Today, China is in the midst of internal and external troubles, and only by taking the common interests of the entire country and the entire nation as the basis to seek unity can it stand firm on a strong foundation. From this strong foundation, we can build a strong organ, that is, the government, to respond to national disasters. This is precisely the road to the Three Principles of the People set by the Prime Minister. Saving the nation depends on this. I respectfully raise this glass to wish Chairman Chiang good health, and good health to the heads of the various ministries and commissions and their colleagues."

<h3>Guangzhou Representatives Hold Meeting to Relieve Rice Shortage</h3>
<p>Decided to Form a Committee to Relieve Food Shortage / Kong Orders Purchase and Transportation of Wuhu Rice to Guangdong</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] After Guangdong halved the tax on imported rice, it was still impossible to transport it into the country due to the high price of imported goods, which did not help the market. The provincial and municipal party headquarters convened representatives from all walks of life on the 23rd to hold a meeting to relieve the rice shortage. They decided to form a committee to relieve the food shortage and telegraphed Nanjing to request a complete exemption from the imported rice tax. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Minister of Finance Kong attaches great importance to the Guangdong rice shortage. In addition to drafting three relief measures, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation, he has also ordered the Food Transportation and Sales Bureau to order the Wuhu agent to purchase Wuhu rice and transport it to Guangdong for emergency relief. It is now known that Zheng Baozhao, the director of the bureau, has been ordered to discuss with Chen Zhongsheng, the manager of the savings department of the Central Trust Bureau, to go to Wuhu to purchase rice in large quantities. The Food Transportation and Sales Bureau has also contacted the transportation agencies to transport the Wuhu rice to Guangdong for a continuous supply of relief. The funds for purchasing the Wuhu rice and the transportation costs are all paid by the Central Trust Bureau. After the Wuhu rice is transported to Guangdong using the exchange settlement method, it will be reimbursed by the Guangdong People's Food Regulation Committee. It is said that this method of purchasing and transporting Wuhu rice to Guangdong can not only completely solve the Guangdong rice shortage, but also prevent the domestic rice market from being affected by the domestic sales of 300,000 metric tons of imported rice in Guangdong Province, which has a half-tax record.

<h3>Changes to Smuggling Suppression Methods on Railways</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] The General Office for Railway Smuggling Suppression believes that it is difficult to implement smuggling suppression in the suburbs of Tianjin due to the environment.

After the Japanese have unloaded the goods and left, they will be detained. Many unscrupulous merchants have been punished, and few people have dared to purchase goods from Tianjin in recent days. Li Tonghua has been deploying smuggling suppression work in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, which is gradually becoming perfect, and results can be expected soon.

<h3>From the Chinese Philosophical Association to the Usefulness of Philosophy</h3>
<p>— Feng Youlan</p>
<p>The Chinese Philosophical Association is holding its third annual meeting in the capital from today to the 26th. This association is a national organization formed by people in China who study philosophy. It has three branches in Beiping, Nanjing, and Guangzhou. It publishes the quarterly journal "Philosophical Review," which has now reached Volume 7, Issue 2, and is published by Shanghai Kaiming Bookstore. Today, on the occasion of the Philosophical Association's meeting, I would like to say a few words about the usefulness of philosophy to arouse everyone's interest in and attention to philosophy.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about now is the usefulness of philosophy in political and social aspects, because these uses are direct and obvious. Throughout the country, from the authorities to young students, everyone likes this kind of usefulness. As for philosophy, like other disciplines, it also has some useless uses: I will not talk about them for the time being.</p>
<p>When the Chinese Philosophical Association held its first annual meeting in Beiping in April of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1935], a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao asked me to write down some thoughts. In that short article, I said: "The world we live in now, on the surface, seems to pay little attention to philosophy, but in essence, our world attaches great importance to philosophy. Throughout the world, in most countries, there are philosophies that they promote and prohibit. From this point, we can see how people now feel the power of philosophy. Every political and social system needs a theoretical basis. Only with a theoretical basis can that political and social organization be 'justified in name.' Looking at history, every society has its ideological 'Taizu Gao Emperor.' For example, Confucius after the Qin and Han dynasties in China, Jesus in the European Middle Ages, and Rousseau in modern times are all the theoretical backbones of a social system, the ideological 'Taizu Gao Emperor' in a society. Now, it is not only a world where nations compete for survival, but also a world where various social systems compete for survival, so everyone feels the importance of the theoretical basis of social systems." Two years have passed, and the situation I described remains unchanged. Many countries in the world want to establish a philosophy as the "orthodox tradition" to "rectify people's hearts, suppress heresies, reject perversions, and ban obscene words." We are in that kind of society, we are in that kind of "orthodox tradition," but we have long been unaware of its existence, just like breathing air.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, the usefulness of philosophy is a bit too great. Let me talk about some small uses of philosophy.</p>
<p>Recently, some people have said that philosophy is not about seeking truth. What philosophy does is to analyze the meaning of propositions in science or common sense clearly. Leaving aside whether this statement can encompass the entirety of philosophy, we can say that at least this is one of the uses of a part of philosophy. Now, in politics and society, there are many problems that everyone is arguing about and many slogans that everyone is shouting. If we use logic to analyze these problems or slogans, some problems will no longer be problems, and some slogans will no longer be slogans.</p>
<p>For example, recently there has been a slogan of "Striving for Freedom to Save the Nation." The term "Freedom to Save the Nation" is really very ambiguous. It has at least three meanings. The first is that one is willing to save the nation, that is, to save the nation, and the work of saving the nation is not restricted. The second is that one is willing to save the nation in any way, that is, to save the nation, and the method of saving the nation is not restricted. The third is that one is willing to save the nation, that is, to save the nation, and one is willing not to save the nation or unwilling to save the nation, and personal behavior is not coerced. According to the first meaning, freedom to save the nation is definitely possible. According to the third meaning, freedom to save the nation is definitely not possible. According to the second meaning, freedom to save the nation can be possible or impossible: it can be possible if the many methods used are not conflicting; it cannot be possible if the many methods used are conflicting. What kind of freedom to save the nation are those who strive for freedom to save the nation striving for; what kind of freedom to save the nation are those who restrict freedom to save the nation restricting; if this is made clear, many unnecessary disputes can be avoided.</p>
<p>For example, recently some people have said that studying cannot save the nation, because many people have studied for many years, but the country is still in trouble. Those who say this are actually due to not understanding the difference between what is called necessary and sufficient in ordinary logic. The success of a thing depends on many conditions. Some conditions are necessary but not sufficient. Some conditions are sufficient but not necessary. Some conditions are necessary and sufficient. Necessary but not sufficient conditions are "having it does not necessarily follow, but not having it necessarily does not follow." For example, if a person only eats, it does not necessarily mean that they can live, but if they do not eat, they definitely cannot live. Sufficient but not necessary conditions are "having it necessarily follows, but not having it does not necessarily not follow." For example, a person who gets typhoid fever necessarily has a fever, but a person who does not get typhoid fever does not necessarily not have a fever; if they get malaria, they can still have a fever. Sufficient and necessary conditions are "having it necessarily follows, and not having it necessarily does not follow." For example, if a person's heart stops beating, then the person dies. Sufficient and necessary conditions only exist for the simplest things. If saving the nation is such a complicated matter, its success depends on countless conditions: each condition is necessary but not sufficient. Having it does not necessarily save the nation, but not having it necessarily cannot save the nation. The relationship between studying and saving the nation is such a relationship. Training soldiers, building roads, training the masses, and so on, are all such relationships for saving the nation. To say that relying only on studying cannot save the nation, so studying is unnecessary, is like saying that relying only on eating cannot keep a person alive, so one should not eat. People now mostly want to do one thing, relying only on this one thing to save the nation. This kind of thing not only does not exist now, but also will not exist in the future, and even more so will not exist. Because the more society evolves, the more detailed the division of labor becomes, and every thing is necessary but not sufficient for society. This is certainly common sense, but when speaking in terms of logic, it becomes even clearer.</p>
<p>For example, the recent debates about the so-called cultural issues can also be resolved with logic. There is a term "Chinese-centric culture"; this term itself can have two meanings. The first meaning is culture that is centered on China. The second meaning is culture that is centered on China's existing culture. According to the first meaning, it can be said that no one disagrees with Chinese-centric culture. All those who advocate building a new Chinese culture, no matter which faction, do not regard themselves as being in the interest of China, that is, none of them do not regard themselves as being centered on China. If according to the second meaning, then there is controversy. There are those who advocate so-called complete Westernization and those who advocate so-called partial Westernization, and they argue with it. In fact, if these disputes are viewed from the perspective of logic, most of them are easily resolved. In logic, there is a distinction between the individual and the type. An individual can represent many types. For example, Confucius can represent many types, such as a person from the Spring and Autumn period, a person from Shandong, a person who lived past the age of seventy, a sage, and so on. The individual learns from that individual, but what is actually learned is a certain type, or several types, that it represents. For example, some people want to learn from Confucius, but what they really want to learn is the type of sage that he represents. The individual cannot be learned. The so-called West is an individual, and in terms of culture, it represents many types, such as Christian culture, scientific culture, industrial culture, etc. When we say learn from the West, what we are really learning is a certain cultural type or several cultural types that it represents, such as scientific culture or industrial culture. As for those aspects of China's original culture that do not conflict with this, of course they will not be changed. For example, Zhu Xi learned from Confucius, but Zhu Xi was not from Shandong, but not being from Shandong does not conflict with being a sage, and Zhu Xi does not need to change to being from Shandong. From this point of view, some of the above-mentioned disputes about culture are resolved without the need for dispute.</p>
<p>The small usefulness of philosophy, although not enough to "rectify people's hearts," can also "banish empty words." All debates that are not logical, or debates that have no meaning from a logical point of view, are obscene words. If there are no obscene words in politics and society, then unnecessary disputes can be reduced a lot.</p>
<h3>Severe Cold and Floods Spread Across Twelve States in the United States</h3>
<p>190,000 People Homeless, Floodwaters Receding After Midnight</p>
<p>[New York] Airplanes, trains, ships, and trucks are fully loaded with food and clothing, rushing to disaster areas to relieve the tens of thousands of homeless refugees. Experts predict that it will take at least a week for the floodwaters to recede to normal levels. The floods have now affected twelve states, with approximately 190,000 people displaced in the disaster areas. The Red Cross is currently conducting a relief campaign and has raised $2 million in Washington. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chicago Severe cold and blizzards are affecting Ohio and parts of the Mississippi Valley areas today, making the flood refugees all the more miserable. Fortunately, the flooding seems to have stopped rising, but the highwaters are still raging in the south and midwest. The Red Cross has asked the country to donate funds to help the victims. Four of the Pottsville Hospitals are now filled with patients suffering from colds and flu. The level of the River in Pittsburgh at 6:00 PM today was 32 feet, seven feet above flood level. The weather bureau predicts that it will rise to 32 feet 9 inches at midnight, and will gradually fall after that. 60,000 relief workers in the disaster area are working hard. (22nd Guomin News)</p>
<p>Cincinnati The Ohio River has risen to the height of the 1884 flood. Government meteorologists predicted today that the United States will have another record-breaking major flood. The Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and other rivers have flooded extensively, forcing 125,000 residents of twelve states to flee their homes. Many more are trapped by the water and have not been able to escape. The amount of property loss cannot yet be estimated. Telegraph, telephone, railway, and highway traffic in the disaster areas have all been blocked. Only very little news has been transmitted from the hundreds of submerged villages. The power supply to Cincinnati and Louisville, Kentucky, is in danger of being cut off at any time by the rising water. The authorities have strictly announced a curfew to prevent hoodlums from looting under cover of darkness. The Kentucky State Prison was flooded today, and although 2,900 prisoners are drawing water in shifts, prison officials say that it will likely become uninhabitable. Several large oil tanks in Aurora, Indiana, have been flooded, and tens of thousands of tons of gasoline are floating on the surface of the water, flowing throughout the town. A Red Cross official there managed to send a telephone message saying, "Two-thirds of the town is now submerged in water, and there is oil floating on the surface of the water, which could cause a fire. Food supplies are dwindling, and we have now implemented a system of rationing food and water." Near Cincinnati, a wooden house was drifting downstream with five people inside, frantically calling for help, but hundreds of onlookers on the shore were unable to help because the current was too swift. The Washington government has dispatched fifty coast guard patrol boats and a seaplane to assist in the rescue work. The most severely affected areas have implemented mobilization of naval reserves and national guards, and another 8,000 people have been ordered to carry out relief work. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt, speaking to reporters at his routine meeting today, requested that both labor and management in the automobile industry not attack each other in the newspapers over the strike issue, and even more so not take publicly irreconcilable positions, so as to avoid both sides falling into a stalemate of unwillingness to give in for the sake of saving face.

According to Lewis's words to reporters, the strike will be extended until the General Motors Corporation is forced to accept collective bargaining agreements. General Motors President Sloan, upon returning to New York from Washington, spoke with reporters, saying that there were many obstacles to a peaceful resolution. At the same time, it was officially announced that General Motors is currently working hard to find ways to resume work at the closed factories, so that "employees who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own" have the opportunity to work.

Italy has not yet expressed its position, but it may be nominated as a member of the committee, given that Italy remains a member state of the League of Nations, while Germany is not. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the issue of re-distribution of raw materials proposed by Polish Foreign Minister Beck, the Administrative Council of the League of Nations has decided to appoint representatives from fourteen groups as committee members to form a committee on the issue of raw material distribution. It will convene under the guidance of the League of Nations soon, with its mission limited to purely theoretical research on the raw material issue to collect information for future economic conferences. This economic conference will only be convened when the general situation improves and when Germany and Italy can genuinely cooperate economically with the member states of the League of Nations. So far, only Brazil, the United States, and Canada have accepted the invitation to participate in the raw materials committee. Furthermore, most Latin American countries have a negative impression of international cooperation to solve the raw material problem. This is because most of the fourteen groups participating in the raw materials committee are either countries with colonies and mandated territories or countries that demand colonies. Therefore, Latin American countries fear that the committee's discussions will not be limited to purely economic issues but will involve political issues, which is not what the Latin American countries desire.

<h3>Discord Between Japanese Army and Navy Leads to Collapse of Hirota Cabinet</h3>
<p>In Power for Ten Months, Feeling Torn Between the Two Sides; Emperor Sends Envoy to Seek Opinion of Saionji</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Cabinet held a meeting this afternoon and passed the final resolution for the Cabinet's resignation en masse, adjourning at 4:50 PM. Prime Minister Hirota entered the Imperial Palace at 5:00 PM, paid his respects to the Emperor, and presented the Cabinet's resignation letter en masse, which was immediately approved by the Emperor. (Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Hirota Cabinet, established only ten months ago, has resigned en masse this afternoon because it could not persuade Army Minister Terauchi to change his decision to dissolve the Diet. The Emperor has approved the resignation, but has ordered Hirota to remain in charge until a new Cabinet is formed. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Today's emergency cabinet meeting, convened on the issue of dissolving the Diet, resulted in internal disunity due to disagreements between the military and cabinet members from political parties. As a result, Prime Minister Hirota decided to submit his resignation en masse. After the resignation letters of the cabinet members were prepared, they were scheduled to enter the palace at 4:50 PM to submit the resignation letters. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] When Prime Minister Hirota presented his resignation letter, he also attached the reasons for his resignation. The gist of it is as follows: Having received the great honor of being appointed to office after the extraordinary incident, I have served until now despite my limited abilities and talents. However, considering the recent political situation, I find it very difficult to administer policies smoothly and fear that I will not be able to proceed smoothly. Therefore, I respectfully request to be relieved of my duties. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The chief secretary, Tsunenuma, the director-general of the Legislative Bureau, Tsugita, and other parliamentary officials from various ministries have submitted their resignation letters due to the collective resignation of the Hirota Cabinet. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Attendant General Hyakutake, receiving the Emperor's instructions, dispatched attendant officer Nitta Motoji with a letter to Okitsu to seek the opinion of Duke Saionji. He departed from Tokyo by train westward at 9:00 PM on the 23rd, stayed overnight in Shizuoka, and is scheduled to arrive in Okitsu at 8:00 AM on the 24th. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Supervisor of Education Sugiyama, Vice Chief of the General Staff Nishio, Vice Minister of the Army Umezu, and Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Isotani, among others, gathered at the Army Minister's official residence at 6:00 PM on the 23rd to discuss the attitude to be taken towards the next cabinet. The Army Minister, upon returning from the cabinet meeting, immediately reported on the situation of the cabinet meeting and exchanged important opinions on future countermeasures. On the naval side, a dinner was held at the Naval Minister's official residence at 6:30 PM. Naval Minister Nagano, Vice Minister Yamamoto, Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff Shimada, Director of the Personnel Bureau Shimizu, and other senior officials attended and held important discussions on the current situation. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The conflict between the Japanese Army and political parties first led to the cabinet's decision to dissolve the Diet, followed by a compromise movement, and finally, the cabinet's resignation en masse. This seems to be a logical sequence in Japanese politics. When the cabinet meeting decided on the principle of dissolving the Diet yesterday, there was still room for mediation, attempting to determine within the last 24 hours whether the political parties were completely determined to overthrow the cabinet. If the political parties had no such determination, they would request a compromise from the military. Therefore, Naval Minister Nagano began mediation last night. Since the political parties accepted the mediation, the crisis could naturally be averted. However, the military insisted on dissolving the Diet, stating that the political parties, with their liberal views, were hindering Japan's future and development by deliberating on national policies, and that there was no other way to make the political parties reflect except by dissolving the Diet. Conversely, the cabinet members did not want to dissolve the Diet from the beginning, especially since the political parties had now accepted the compromise terms, making the dissolution even more baseless. Before the emergency cabinet meeting, the debate over the opinions advocating and opposing the dissolution of the Diet was quite intense, so the cabinet meeting resulted in the decision to resign en masse. (Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Army's Strong Stance Leads to Failure of Naval Minister's Mediation</h3>
<p>Army Authorities Hold Two Meetings, Decide to Move Forward with Established Policy</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Naval Minister Mizuno received formal responses from both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties on the 23rd, so he arranged to meet with Army Minister Terauchi. Recognizing the seriousness of the current situation, he intended to earnestly implore the Army Minister to move towards compromise and overcome the difficult situation. Since the Naval Minister consistently wanted to avoid dissolution, he was determined to ensure the passage of the budget and important bills. Therefore, this meeting, even if it could not establish a compromise, would see him fully express this belief at the cabinet meeting on the 23rd. If the Army did not respond in a cooperative manner, it would lead to disunity within the cabinet. Afterwards, either a further request would be made to suspend the meeting and engage in compromise efforts with the Army, or a resignation en masse would be decided upon, one of the two. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Army held a meeting of its leaders at 8:00 AM on the 23rd, attended by Vice Minister Umezu, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Kitani, Chief of the Military Affairs Section Ishimoto, and Chief of the Press Section Hata, among others. Focusing on the issue of Naval Minister Nagano's visit to the presidents of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, the results of the discussion on the attitude and policy the Army should adopt in the future reached the following conclusion: Although Naval Minister Nagano visited the presidents of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties for the sake of mediation, the Army did not receive any notification and was unaware of this. Therefore, the Army decided to adhere to its established policy and consistently advocate for dissolution. At the cabinet meeting on the 23rd, the Army Minister would strongly advocate for it again. If Naval Minister Mizuno insisted on avoiding dissolution, the Army Minister would have no choice but to resign alone. Although the political situation would be thrown into confusion as a result, the Army would naturally not bear the responsibility for it. The meeting adjourned at 10:10 AM. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After holding a meeting of its leaders on the morning of the 23rd, the Army authorities held an emergency meeting of the three chiefs from 11:00 AM, attended by Army Minister Terauchi, Supervisor of Education Sugiyama, and Vice Chief of the General Staff Nishio. The Army Minister reported on the policy decided upon at the meeting of leaders, to exclude all compromises, to hope for the clarification of politics, and explained the internal situation. After discussion, the three agreed unanimously that the Army Minister would reject Naval Minister Nagano's compromise measures at the afternoon's emergency cabinet meeting and continue to move forward with the established policy. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Implement Active Policies</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding this political upheaval, the Army issued a statement in the form of an official announcement, as follows: The reasons for the Army Minister's request for resignation have already been explained by the Army Minister. Now, I will state the Army's consistent aspirations. The grand policy of national defense and national policy that the Army aims for is to clarify the concept of national morality and implement active domestic and foreign policies. Since the end of the World War, there have been drastic changes in thought, and economic and international relations have also changed. However, the country's policies have not adapted to the reality, and the country is in dire straits, and the lives of the people are extremely oppressed. Since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, Japan has become a stabilizing force in East Asia, seeking to guarantee peace and coexist and prosper with other countries, and to ensure the survival and development of the nation. Therefore, it is believed that the implementation of an active national military is even more necessary at this time. The problems of Japan's population and stabilizing the lives of the people can only be solved by implementing this grand national policy. If we are satisfied with the current situation, the country will decline day by day and fall into dire straits. This is self-evident. Therefore, to build a leaping Japan, it is necessary not only to implement the national defense plans that are being pursued, but also to realize policies that will renew all aspects of government in order to stabilize the lives of the people. This is the grand outline of Japan's national policy, which should be confirmed. To implement the realistic grand policy and the grand outline of national policy, it is even more urgent to exert Japan's unique constitutional spirit and implement fair and strong politics. However, observing the current state of the political world, it lacks an understanding of the current situation, engages only in party interests and party strategies, and has degenerated into a passive and conservative maintenance of the status quo, which is extremely regrettable. Under this current state of affairs, we should reject the compromising means of appeasement and resolutely carry out a fundamental cleansing of the political world in order to express the will of the people. This should be the key element in the center of the current political situation. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Nagano's Statement</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Naval Minister Nagano said, "Now is a time of national emergency, and I deeply believe that the entire country should unite to deal with the situation and avoid domestic disputes. Because this year is the first year after the abolition of the naval treaty, I obtained the cooperation of Commerce Minister Ogawa to mediate the political dispute in my personal capacity, and met with Machida, Suzuki, Hatoyama, and others, and obtained their understanding. I plan to meet with Army Minister Terauchi today to express my beliefs and urge him to do his best for the country." (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Hirota Cabinet Amidst Resignation Rumors</h3>
<h3>Explosion at Japanese Army Ordnance Factory</h3>
<p>Five Dead, Four Injured</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Ministry of the Army announced that at 8:00 AM on the 23rd, a fire broke out at the Kyokyo smokeless powder manufacturing plant of the Army Ordnance Factory while workers were mixing smokeless powder. Five workers in the room died immediately, three were seriously injured, and one passerby was burned. Although some of the gunpowder being worked on was moved out, most of it was burned. The cause is under investigation. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Prince Konoe Is the Most Popular Choice for New Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Left-Wing Organizations Form a Restoration Party; Japanese Political Situation Becomes Increasingly Complex</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Whenever a political upheaval occurs, it has become customary for the Emperor to summon Saionji to Kyoto or send an attendant to inquire about his choice for the next prime minister. However, this time, the Army is strongly opposed to members of existing political parties entering the next cabinet and has preemptively advocated that the new cabinet dissolve the Diet. Therefore, resolving the situation will take some time. Even if Duke Saionji is ordered to make a recommendation, he will do so with extreme caution. Moreover, the Duke has recently been slightly unwell. Even if there is an imperial order, he may not be able to go to Kyoto. Considering all the circumstances, it is especially important to understand the intentions of the Army. Perhaps he will contact Grand Chamberlain Yuasa and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Matsumoto and other senior officials and ask the attendant to answer the imperial inquiry on his behalf. Currently, the leading candidates for prime minister include Prince Konoe Fumimaro, Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō, General of the Army Ugaki Kazushige, and Admiral of the Navy Suetsugu Nobumasa. However, the Army hopes that Prince Konoe will take the lead. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] This morning, the editorials of various newspapers unanimously opposed dissolving the Diet, but some newspapers also opposed the cabinet's resignation and supported a compromise. Other newspapers believed that the cabinet's resignation was the only way to break the current deadlock. The final curtain has not yet been raised, and the movement to form a new party is already underway. Some support Konoe Fumimaro, and some support Ugaki Kazushige. It is said that both factions can gain some support from the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, but it is very difficult to gain the support of the majority. The Japanese political situation has reached an extremely complex stage. (Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Current Affairs Consultative Council, in view of the pressing political situation, aims to promote the unity of national patriotic organizations and establish a large restoration party. It has decided to proceed with preparatory work. Discussions have been held since the night of the 22nd, and concrete results will be revealed within days. The groups currently participating include the New Japan Seamen's Union, the Japan National League, the Greater Japan Production Party, the Japan Federation of Labor Unions, the Greater Japan Youth Party, the National Association, and the Patriotic Labor-Farmer Comrades Association. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russian Party Trial Opens; Defendants Plead Guilty</h3>
<p>Radek and Seventeen Other Key Figures to Be Executed for Endangering the Party and the Country</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Supreme Court's Military Tribunal held a public hearing again today, with seventeen former high-ranking Soviet Russian officials as defendants, including the famous writer Radek and former Ambassador to Britain Sokolnikov. If found guilty, they will be sentenced to death. The atmosphere was tense as the court clerk read out the lengthy indictment. The audience was extremely crowded, and guards patrolled the streets near the court. Trotsky, as in the previous hearing, was not listed as a key defendant and remains at large. The indictment alleges that all the defendants conspired under Trotsky's direction to contact Germany, Poland, and Japan to undermine the Soviet regime. It also claimed that Trotsky had negotiated with Hitler's representative Hess in Berlin, agreeing that in the event of war, Radek's faction should obey the German General Staff and engage in military sabotage and espionage. Radek was accused of organizing a "parallel center" to continue working after Trotsky's center failed. The so-called Trotsky center is the group that Zinoviev and Kamenev, who were executed, were accused of joining. It is alleged that the "parallel center" also planned to allow Japan to use the oil resources of Sakhalin when Japan attacked the United States, and to facilitate Japan's conquest of China. The defendants are also accused of espionage and terrorist acts, and of attempting to restore capitalism in Russia. The defendants also include former Deputy Commissioner of Heavy Industry Pipikov, Commissioner of Agriculture Lalov from 1930 to 1934, former Director of the Middle East Railway Siliblekov, and Troparis, who testified in the trial of German engineer Stickling last winter. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Regarding the case of the "parallel center," an anti-revolutionary organization established by the Trotsky faction, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court publicly questioned the defendants today. Presiding Judge Ulekh, Prosecutor General Vyshinsky, and defendants Knyazev, Pukin, and Arnot were defended by lawyers Brandt Gamatov and Gasnazev, while the remaining defendants defended themselves. After the indictment was read in court, all of the defendants pleaded guilty. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Army Opposes Party Members Joining the Cabinet</h3>
<p>Candidates for New Army Minister: Sugiyama or Itagaki</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Army's hopes for the next cabinet can be broadly divided into the following:</p>
<p>(1) The next cabinet must have a deep understanding of the seriousness of the current international situation, strive to develop Japan's national power externally, implement new policies internally, and recruit sincere and enthusiastic individuals to form a strong and capable cabinet.</p>
<p>(2) The new cabinet must implement new policies in all aspects of government, strengthen national defense, stabilize the lives of the people, and resolutely implement strong national policies. This should be its major mission. Cabinet members must be recruited from individuals who have a full understanding of the emergency situation. At the same time, it should absolutely reject any compromise or collusion with political parties that have different understandings of the situation.</p>
<p>(3) If it seeks cooperation with such political parties or appoints members of such parties as cabinet members, the Army will find it difficult to assist such a cabinet, and it will hesitate to recommend a replacement for the outgoing Army Minister. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the collapse of the Hirota cabinet, the most important issue in organizing the next cabinet is the question of who will be the next Army Minister. The military believes that General Sugiyama Moto, the current Supervisor of Education, or Lieutenant General Koiso Kuniaki, Commander of the Korean Army, and Lieutenant General Itagaki Seishiro, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, are promising candidates. One of these three will be selected. It would be easiest for General Sugiyama to take office, but it will also depend on the opinion of the one in charge of forming the new cabinet. If he advocates implementing active reform policies, then Lieutenant General Itagaki's candidacy is considered the most promising. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<h3>House of Peers and House of Representatives Decide to Adjourn</h3>
<p>Until New Cabinet Is Established</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Hirota Cabinet decided to resign en masse on the 23rd. Therefore, following precedent, the House of Peers and the House of Representatives are scheduled to convene a formal meeting on the 25th to decide to adjourn until the announcement of the establishment of a new cabinet. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At the cabinet meeting on the 23rd, it was decided to appoint the current Minister of Justice, Hayashi Raisaburo, as a member of the House of Peers chosen by imperial command, in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 4 of the House of Peers Ordinance. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hirota announced at today's cabinet meeting that he would recommend Foreign Minister Arita as a member chosen by imperial command. Foreign Minister Arita said that he had some reservations and requested to decline the imperial appointment, so the request was temporarily suspended. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Commentary</h3>
<p>[London] The Manchester Guardian recently commented on the resignation of the Hirota Cabinet in Japan, stating: "The path that Japan should choose in the future is different from the paths chosen by Italy and Germany in the past. Italy and Germany chose one of the two paths of Fascism and Socialism. However, the two paths that Japan should choose in the future are either a military oligarchy that disregards the interests of big business or a civilian bureaucracy. It must choose one of these two paths. If a revolution occurs in Japan, it is more likely to be instigated by the military than by farmers and workers. What the military hopes for is the mutual opposition between the government and the Diet. However, as this tendency towards opposition deepens, it not only causes concern among those who advocate democracy, but also makes major political parties such as the Seiyukai and Minseito feel deeply uneasy about the threat to their own existence." (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Rampant Smuggling in North China</h3>
<p>Li Xing Arrives in Tianjin to Negotiate Crackdown, but Results are Nil; Rōnin Disguise Themselves as Passengers to Transport Contraband</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The newly appointed Director of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau of the Ministry of Finance's Railway Transport, Li Xing, arrived in Tianjin on the 13th of this month to assume office. This time, Li's arrival carries the Ministry of Finance's new hope for anti-smuggling efforts in North China, with the expectation that Li can negotiate satisfactorily with all parties and eradicate the source of smuggling in a short period. However, the only methods instructed are to have Li directly consult with the authorities in North China to seek assistance from military and police agencies for interception, with no other means available. Therefore, after arriving in Tianjin, Li, following this directive, repeatedly discussed the matter with Mei Weiliang, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, and Zhang Zizhong, the Mayor of Tianjin. However, the highest local authorities felt that the diplomatic hurdles had not been overcome, and empty talk of assistance remained superficial. If the military and police agencies disregarded the facts and acted rashly, they would be directly responsible on behalf of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau. Consequently, no concrete action was indicated. Recently, Feng Zhi'an, the Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, came to Tianjin to visit foreign dignitaries. Li Xing also visited him and made the same plea. Feng's response was no different from that of the municipal authorities. Therefore, Li's efforts in Tianjin for more than ten days have yielded no results. The only hope now lies in what Song Zheyuan will say. If Song allows and instructs military and police agencies to assist in unison, there may still be hope for anti-smuggling efforts. Otherwise, the Anti-Smuggling Bureau's move to Tianjin and the replacement of Ansier with Li Xing will not remedy the situation. Song has been in Tianjin for three days, and Li has requested an appointment but has not received a response. It is estimated that a meeting will be difficult to obtain this week.</p>
<p>With the Spring Festival less than two weeks away, the markets in various cities and towns have always been very active at the end of the lunar year, and it is also an opportunity for the large-scale sale of smuggled goods. Therefore, smuggling merchants have recently revived the practice of using heavy-duty trucks to transport goods out of Tianjin. After 6:00 PM every night, the road from Xiaoyingmen in western Tianjin to Baoding and Beiping is filled with a continuous stream of vehicles, with at least 15 trucks in each convoy. Although there are customs officers stationed at the branch checkpoint in that area, they often suffer beatings and injuries from rōnin when they try to intercept too strictly. Therefore, whenever large convoys of smuggled goods pass through, they can only pretend not to see them and let them pass. Only when there are small, scattered batches or no rōnin escorts do they dare to intercept. Currently, there is no effective way to combat smuggling in the suburbs. As for the smuggled goods transported by the Jinpu Railway, effective interception was achieved after July last year. However, this good phenomenon was not maintained permanently. Starting last week, rōnin have again been forming groups of twenty or thirty, disguising themselves as passengers, buying tickets, and boarding Jinpu Railway cars. Each person carries luggage and parcels containing artificial silk, sugar, seafood, and other items, some carrying over a hundred catties, and others carrying sixty kilograms. Customs officers, fearing that they are in large groups and armed, dare not inspect them directly. As a result, the southbound passenger cars departing from Tianjin every night are crowded, and the strange phenomenon of last spring has reappeared. These smuggled goods are mostly transported to Cangxian Botouzhen and various cities and towns along the border between Shandong and Hebei, where they are sold at low prices, also in an attempt to take advantage of the Spring Festival opportunity to sell in large quantities. Recently, Li Tonghua, Deputy Director of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau of Railway Transport, is deploying prevention and interception efforts between Dezhou and Jinan for this matter. However, judging from the situation, it is still feared that it will be impossible to completely prevent smuggling north of Dezhou. (21st)</p>
<h3>The "Minzu" Ferry Traveling Between Guangzhou and Jiangmen Sinks After Hitting a Reef</h3>
<p>Over a Hundred Passengers and Crew Drown; Estimated Total Loss of Approximately 150,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Jiangmen Town in Guangdong Province is one of the four largest cities in the province, with thriving commerce and accessible transportation. It is also the waterway through which Enping, Kaiping, Taishan, and Xinhui counties enter and exit. Therefore, people from these four counties often travel between the provincial capital and their hometowns by taking the Jiangmen ferry. As a result, the shipping industry there is very developed. Among the ferries traveling between Guangzhou and Jiangmen, the "Minzu" ("National") ferry, due to its large number of passengers, has seen its business thrive. The "Minzu" was always the leader among the rural ferries, with careful protection, complete equipment, and a hull larger than other ships. It had traveled safely between Guangzhou and Jiangmen for many years. Unexpectedly, Guangdong Province has been experiencing a series of natural disasters and human calamities in the past month. Amidst the rice shortage and just after the horrific train burning incident on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, the "Minzu" ferry suddenly sank, drowning hundreds of people. Misfortunes never come singly; this is truly a portrayal of today's Guangdong society. A summary of the tragic sinking is described below:</p>
<p>Dangerous Shoals</p>
<p>Ganzhu Shoal, located in Shunde County, has long been a historically perilous passage. Shoals and rocks stand in the river, and when the West River flows to this point, it is blocked by the shoals, causing it to pool and swirl, with the sound of the waves reaching for miles. During the flood season in spring and summer, the water is as swift as arrows, and even small steamships have difficulty going upstream at full power. In winter, when the water is low, it is also difficult for ships to cross the shoal. The rugged boulders in the shoal, especially the one known as "Incense Burner Rock," are particularly dangerous. Opposite Incense Burner Rock is the Tin Hau Temple, built by superstitious villagers. According to legend, ships passing by offer prayers at the temple and then cross the shoal safely. Incense Burner Rock is located in front of the temple, serving as a natural incense burner for the temple. Its name is said to have come from this. Another theory says that countless ships have encountered accidents here throughout history, and the rock is the incense burner for the water burials of the dead. From this speculation, the difficulty of the shoal passage can be seen. As for the facts of shipwrecks, not to mention those in the distant past, in recent years alone, ferry accidents here have occurred almost every year. The Heshan Steamboat, Gongyuan Steamboat, and the Yong'an ferry, all traveling from Guangzhou to Ducheng, have sunk one after another, each time drowning hundreds of people. Last year, someone suggested that the shoal rocks be bombed to reduce the force of the water and facilitate navigation. However, after weighing the pros and cons, it was difficult to do. If the shoal rocks were leveled, the raging torrent of the West River would rush down during the flood season, unstoppable, pouring thousands of miles downstream, and the villages would suffer. The bombing of the shoal was halted after villagers pleaded and appealed. Therefore, Ganzhu Shoal remains a major obstacle to navigation.</p>
<p>The Accident</p>
<p>The "Minzu" ferry traveling between Guangzhou and Jiangmen was scheduled to depart from Guangzhou at 7:00 PM every day. On the afternoon of the 19th, it departed as usual, carrying over 340 passengers and a large cargo. It passed through Huanglian Leiliu, which belongs to Shunde County, and entered Lihai, cut out of Dengjiao Sha, and saw the Jielong Bridge, and then went up the shoal. At about 3:00 AM on the 20th, when it reached Incense Burner Rock, the Model steamship, which was towing the "Minzu," opened up to full speed and crossed the shoal. However, because the "Minzu" ferry was heavy and the water was shallow, it still could not cross the shoal after two attempts. Finally, on the third attempt, the hull crashed into a reef with a loud bang. The cargo hold was pierced, forming a huge hole. River water gurgled in. At this time, the passengers were awakened from their sleep and realized there was an accident. They all scrambled to escape, shouting for help. Those familiar with swimming jumped into the water and fled. Before long, the passengers gathered tightly in one corner, the hull tilted, and the entire ship went into the water. The hundreds of lives were submerged along with the cabin.</p>
<p>Rescue</p>
<p>When the "Minzu" ferry sank, the Model steamship, which was ahead, turned back to rescue. It rescued more than ten people on the spot and transported them to the shore. At the same time, ferries operating on the same route, such as the Zhonghua, Da Jiu Jiang, Hexing, and Da An, passed by one after another and rushed forward to rescue them. They rescued a total of about 180 people and sent them to Jiangmen. At that time, the Jiangmen Mingshan Hall immediately sent four rescue boats, and the Red Cross sent one boat, to the scene of the accident to rescue survivors. They arrived at about 11:00 AM on the 20th and recovered seven male and female bodies from Youkeng in Ganzhu Shoal, mostly dressed in cloth clothing, about thirty or forty years old. There was also the body of a young girl. It is estimated that there were over a hundred bodies trapped in the cabin that had not surfaced. As for the cargo on the ship, it had all been washed away. The sunken "Minzu" only had its mast and canopy visible. More than ten crew members survived, but eight were missing. Those who were rescued were either sent back to Jiangmen on their own, or the injured were treated at the Ganzhu Airen Shantang Hospital nearby. On the same day, the Ganzhu Shantang also sent local workers to retrieve the bodies.</p>
<p>Retrieving Bodies</p>
<p>After the survivors returned to Jiangmen, they reported to the county government. County Magistrate Li of Xinhui immediately telegraphed the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs, requesting that the province send a body recovery team and a lifting ship to handle the matter. At the same time, the Model steamship sent more than 20 of the rescued passengers to the provincial capital and reported to the shipping company. The company immediately hired four lifeboats and four crane ships, ordering the Model steamship to transport them to the scene of the accident to carry out the rescue. On the same day, the Fangbian Hospital also sent a rescue team and a body inspection team, equipped with tools, to the scene by boat. Later, they used boats to purchase eighty or ninety coffins and transport them to encoffin the bodies, and they photographed and numbered the bodies found nearby in order to encoffin them, kept them on the shore to wait for relatives to claim them, and no longer transported them to the province, so as to avoid provincial procedures. The lifeboat and rescue team sent by the province arrived at the scene of the accident at 8:00 PM on the 20th, but it was at night and it was not convenient to work. It was not until the morning of the 21st that the crane was used to lift the sunken ship and retrieve the bodies trapped in the cabin. Therefore, the actual number of drowning deaths is still under investigation. However, based on the number of over a hundred people rescued, the number of drowning deaths must be over a hundred.</p>
<p>Losses</p>
<p>This time, the "Minzu" ship was heading to Jiangmen. Because it was near the end of the year, many people in the countryside were purchasing goods from the province and transporting them back by ferry. It is estimated that the cargo on board was worth about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, the passengers' property loss was about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and the loss of the "Minzu" ship, including the ship's value and installation costs, was a total of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, for a total loss of 150,000 yuan. The bodies of the drowned were mostly swept away by the turbulent current, and some were deposited among the reefs and had not yet surfaced. The bodies that had been salvaged were mostly bloated, making identification difficult.</p>
<p>Other News</p>
<p>According to the crew, if the passengers had remained calm when the "Minzu" ferry sank and had not panicked, it might have been possible to save them. When the ship was built, an extra layer of wooden piles was added to the bottom of the ship to prevent the bottom from being pierced, and the protection of the wooden piles could also be used for repairs. However, this time, the passengers gathered in one corner, causing the hull to tilt, and it was difficult to repair. The ship's passenger capacity was limited to 382, but on this day, it was only carrying 344 passengers. The waterline on the side of the ship was supposed to be eight inches from the water surface, but that night, the load not only did not exceed the limit, but the waterline was more than one foot from the water surface.

<h3>Details of the Xin Beijing Ship Accident</h3>
<p>The Shipowner's Negligence Caused the Accident, Running Aground on a Reef; Passengers Were Transferred Safely, but Damage Was Significant</p>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: The Taikoo Yanghang's "Xin Beijing" ("New Beijing") ship, which operates on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, is known for its solid hull, with a net tonnage of 2,300 tons. It has been operating between Shanghai and Ningbo for a long time. The shipowner is a Dutchman named Mai Gencai, and the compradore is a Ningbo native named Zheng Renye. There are over 300 officers and crew members on board. On the evening of the 20th, it departed from Shanghai for Ningbo, carrying seven or eight hundred male and female passengers and 2,820 pieces of cargo. At 4:05 AM on the 21st, the second mate, a Westerner named Hua'erlin, as usual, handed over the responsibility of steering the ship to the shipowner, Mai Gencai, as the ship was about to reach the Zhenhai Estuary. Unexpectedly, Mai was negligent for a moment and did not immediately observe the course of the sea. Therefore, he did not give any instructions to the helmsman. The helmsman, who had a lot of experience, asked Mai if there were any changes in direction. Mai then noticed and looked at the sea, realizing that they were near the Laotaipo Reef. He urgently ordered the helmsman to turn the rudder and change direction, but it was too late. The bow of the ship crashed into the Laotaipo Reef and ran aground. At that time, there was a loud bang, and the ship shook violently. All the passengers on board were awakened from their sleep, some falling from their bunks, and others being bumped. Fortunately, there were few injuries. The Laotaipo Reef is only half an hour's journey from the Zhenhai Estuary, and is on the old Hongyuan Fort sea area, next to Longshan, opposite Lishan, and at the entrance of Xiaogangmen. It is the only dangerous navigation route to enter the Zhenhai Estuary. There is a wooden pole sign on the reef to indicate danger. As the ship touched the reef, the hull was stuck by the reef. The front part of the hull was grounded on the reef, and the bow was raised high. The bottom of the front hold was broken, and water entered to a depth of more than a zhang. Fortunately, there was no cargo in the front hold, and it was separated from the middle hold. Although the hull lost its balance and tilted slightly, it was not about to capsize because the bottom of the ship was stuck on the reef. When Mai saw the great disaster, he immediately ordered a radio message to be sent to the Shanghai headquarters to ask for help. At 7:30 AM, the Ningbo office received a telegram from the headquarters, and urgently hired ten ships from Zhenbei, Lianyi, Yin Ci, and Yin Yu, to tow barges to the scene of the accident to rescue passengers. The Jianghai Customs No. 25 patrol ship Yunxing, the foreign water police bureau's Tai'an ship, and a British warship all sailed nearby to guard. As of 4:00 PM, all of the ship's passengers had been rescued and transported to Ningbo, with only slight luggage losses. Among the passengers was Ms. Xu, Zhang Xueliang's concubine, who had come from Shanghai to Ningbo to visit scenic spots with a Chinese and Western entourage. She suffered a great fright as a result. The Shanghai headquarters has now sent a HSBC tugboat to the Laotaipo Reef to prepare to rescue the ship from danger. On one hand, the Ningbo office hired more than 20 barges to unload the cargo. The extent of the damage to the ship is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Plans to Dredge the Gu Pu Tang</h3>
<p>The county's water conservancy relies on the Huangpu River in the south and the Mao River in the north, while the Gu Pu Tang actually uses the Mao River as its tailwater. The pond is located between the first and fourth districts, benefiting fields and acres in fifteen or sixteen townships, and the Shihudang and Xiazhuang townships in the fifth district are also within the scope of the requisitioned labor. The Gu Pu Tang of this National Labor Service term has been lacking dredging for many years, affecting water conservancy and transportation. The county government submitted a request to the Construction Department for approval to dredge. The county appointed the first and fourth district chiefs as the chief and deputy directors of the river project, and also hired local people from the two districts, such as Zhang Jiliang, as members. The surveying and mapping has been completed. The fifth district chief, Ye Lilin, was added as the deputy director. On the 22nd, the county government convened a meeting to decide to submit the register of benefited fields and acres within the scope of the requisitioned labor by February 5th, in order to compile and verify the allocation of labor. The start date for construction was set for February 15th, and all sections will be dredged uniformly. The county magistrate ordered the township police to be responsible for investigating and reporting the field and acre registers and submitting them to the district for forwarding.</p>

<h3>Measurement Team Wins Zilin Cup</h3>
<p>Yoyo Suffers Defeat at Two to Three</p>
<p>After the Yoyo and Measurement teams secured the right to compete in the final of the Zilin Cup, a competition involving thirteen teams, the final took place yesterday at Hongkou Park. Prior to the match, Yoyo was highly favored. After the teams took to the field, Yoyo also seemed to have the advantage in terms of both strength and formation. However, contrary to expectations, the lackluster Measurement team eliminated Yoyo with a score of three to two, and the coveted silver cup was relinquished. The details of the battle between the two teams are described below:</p>
<p>First Half: As a result of the coin toss, Measurement attacked first, advancing aggressively. The right forward, Muller, took a shot, but Yoyo's defender, Chen Xiaoping, made a clumsy mistake, scoring an own goal and gifting Measurement a point. Shortly after, Wang Zhangxian scored, making it one to one. Subsequently, Yoyo was awarded a penalty kick due to an infraction by Measurement's inside forward. Shen Shiqi took the shot, but it hit the post and bounced out. However, Shen Shiqi soon received a pass from the center-back line and scored, putting Yoyo ahead at two to one. However, there were more opportunities, but due to slow footwork, they were missed.</p>
<p>Second Half: After the lemon break, Measurement's attack was very strong within five minutes, but soon Yoyo took control. However, due to continued sluggishness, they missed countless opportunities. After about 20 minutes of stalemate, Measurement made a comeback, and the entire team advanced into Yoyo's territory. Zhao Zisheng, eager to save the situation, accidentally handled the ball, resulting in a penalty kick. One of Measurement's central defenders, Heineley, scored, making it two to two. Measurement continued to press fiercely, and Yoyo's territory was in extreme danger. Fortunately, the situation soon stabilized. Later, Shen Shiqi had a free kick opportunity from 20 yards out, with an excellent angle. However, due to a lack of support, the opportunity was not fully realized. Finally, in the last minute, Measurement's center forward, Harrison, shot. Wang Zhigao was too careless, slightly blocking the shot with his hands, but it still went in. Measurement won the championship with a score of three to two. The awards ceremony was held on the spot, and the Measurement team took the Zilin Cup away. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Measurement Team:</p>
<p>Yoyo Club:</p>

<h3>Feng Weiren Unfortunate to Lose to Yoshimura</h3>
<p>Our country's boxing master, Mr. Feng Weiren, was invited by Yoshimura Fumio, a Japanese resident in Tianjin, to compete in a Sino-Japanese championship match at the Alber Road Jai Alai Stadium yesterday. Prior to this headline match, there were nine boxing matches, and another one was added temporarily, making a total of eleven matches. Yesterday, there were three Japanese boxers. Miyagawa Saburo at 120 pounds lost to French boxer Moni shortly after the start of the first round. Akita Yutaka at 147 pounds also lost to Russian boxer Lev Renigu. In the morning, Yoshimura and Feng fought a ten-round match of two minutes each. Feng's arm injury was still being treated, so a doctor was present on site. After the start, Feng was very brave in the first round, and Yoshimura's nose was injured by Feng, almost forcing him to quit. After being persuaded by his teammates, he continued the match. From the second round, Yoshimura's counterattack became very intense. In the third round, Yoshimura elbowed Feng's neck, causing a loud uproar. In the fourth round, Yoshimura rushed forward, but Feng cleverly dodged, almost causing Yoshimura to fall. From the ninth round, Feng gradually showed signs of fatigue due to not having fully recovered his strength. Both sides were covered in blood. In the sixth round, Feng was forced into the corner twice, almost falling. Yoshimura gained the upper hand again in the eighth round. In the ninth and tenth rounds, Feng gradually resumed his offense, but was finally suppressed again, resulting in a crushing defeat. However, the failure due to the unhealed arm injury is not enough to judge a hero.</p>

<h3>The Sixth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Sociological Society Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than 30 members from various places attended. The meeting will continue today to discuss social affairs.</p>
<p>The sixth annual meeting of the Chinese Sociological Society was held at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 9:00 AM yesterday. The opening ceremony was held in the morning, and papers were read. In the afternoon, the curriculum was discussed. The papers will continue to be read this morning, and social affairs will be discussed this afternoon. There will be a dinner in the evening. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Members</p>
<p>Including Wu Jingchao • Wu Zelin (Jinan), Zhao Chengxin (Yanjing), Sun Benwen (Central), Hua Dingyi (Law School), Yan Jingyao (Municipal Council), Qian Shengzong (Fudan), Long Guanhai (Huigen Women's University), Yu Zhenji • Yang Zhongming (Guanghua), Chen Shaoji • Zhong Guiyang (Daxia), Hu Tigan (Henan), Jin Wuzhou • Gu Zhengshu (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Opening Remarks</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department attended. First, Chairman Wu Jingchao delivered the opening remarks, stating that the sixth annual meeting of the Society was originally scheduled to be held at Tsinghua University in Beiping last summer. Later, it was proposed to postpone it to August and hold the annual meeting jointly with various academic groups. However, the negotiations were unsuccessful, and the meeting was postponed to the 1st and 2nd of this month to be held independently. Due to the sudden Xi'an Incident, it was inconvenient for members from other places to attend, so it was postponed to today and tomorrow. In addition to the reading of papers, there will also be discussions on social affairs. The central issue is the improvement of Chinese sociology. On the one hand, we will examine whether the curriculum of the sociology department meets the needs of students, and whether the work of students after graduation is compatible with the training they received at the school. The revision and deletion of curriculum aspects need to be discussed together. On the other hand, we also need to discuss the future direction of sociology. Sociology is a new science with a short history in China. The work in the past one or two decades has focused on the introduction of foreign sociological theories. Now, do we need to create Chinese sociology and pay attention to the actual problems of Chinese society? This also requires the joint expression of opinions. Secondly, the issue of the continuation of the Sociological Monthly will also be raised for discussion at this meeting. Finally, I have one feeling. The first annual meeting of the Society was also held in Shanghai. That is, in terms of numbers, the Chinese sociology department is superficially prosperous, but there are not many people who study it. Now, although the sociology department has decreased, the quality is much more advanced than before.</p>
<p>Reading Papers</p>
<p>After the representatives of the Municipal Party read their speeches, the papers were read. ㊀ Zhao Chengxin, Community Research and the Construction of Sociology, ㊁ Series of Articles on the Methodological Problems of Studying Chinese Culture, ㊂ Moshi Men • Recommendation for the Formation of Social Work Training in China ㊃ Yan Xinzhe • Theory and Practice of Social Investigation Design,</p>
<p>Discussion Content</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Literary Writers Association Issues Declaration to Suppress Treason and Eliminate Communism</h3>
<p>Responding to the Call of the China Cultural Construction Association</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Literary Association recently issued a declaration in response to the call of the China Cultural Construction Association. The original text is as follows: After reading the call of the China Cultural Construction Association, we appeal to the Central Government to uphold discipline by punishing traitors, pacify the people by suppressing bandits, and strengthen the country to resist foreign enemies. We feel that these three things are indeed the key to national salvation and survival at present, especially the suppression of communist bandits, which is even more urgent. We know why Zhang Xueliang, the chief culprit of the Shaanxi Incident, and the rebellious generals Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong, did such crazy things to destroy the nation. This is obviously because the communist bandits colluded with them, and they were happy to be fooled by the communist bandits, absurdly trying to organize a "national defense government" and unite with a "people's front" to destroy the country and exterminate the race, digging their own graves. China now needs unity, but they deliberately try to carve up the country. China now needs construction, but they deliberately destroy it. To be honest, they are no longer Chinese, they are traitors who sell out China, they are the public enemy of the people, and they are also puppets of the communist bandits. We don't know why the bandit puppet army on the border is so rampant. Of course, there is the background of imperialist aggression, but the communist bandits disrupt the rear and incite the front line, meticulously hindering the progress of the national army, which is a very serious fact. At the same time, the communist bandits collude with red imperialism, and their cruel harm to China is even more unforgivable. Because of the communist bandits, traitors dare to be so tyrannical and puppets dare to be so rampant. Society is so unstable and the people's livelihood is so haggard. Therefore, suppressing traitors and resisting the enemy must be based on suppressing the communist bandits. China must be self-reliant, and the communist bandits who destroy unity and construction must be eliminated first. Furthermore, to eliminate the heinous communist bandits, we must fundamentally eliminate the red ideology that anesthetizes young people and poisons the society. In recent years, red ideology has been spreading poison under the guise of so-called leftist writers and popular literature and art, stealing a good name, and singing loudly about "national defense literature" and "national liberation movement," which is endless, deceiving the world and confusing the public. A few boring literati do not hesitate to demean their personality and speak up for the communist bandits. Heretical ideas anesthetize young people, which is really a fundamental disaster. We feel that it is important to use military force to eliminate the communist bandits, but it is even more important to eliminate the communist bandits from the ideological point of view. We must follow this inevitable path to settle people's hearts and support righteousness, so that the will of the whole people is concentrated on the belief in the Three Principles of the People, and then our nation has the possibility of revival. Now, the survival of the country and the rise and fall of the nation have reached a critical moment. We hope that all compatriots in the country will unite to support the central government, eliminate all reactionaries, and hope that the cultural circles of the whole country will recognize the current political line, expose the communist bandits' conspiracy, vigorously expose the evil theories such as the People's Front, lead the youth, and enlighten the masses to break through the current national crisis from the ideological point of view and complete the cultural construction of the Three Principles of the People. This is our declaration.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>The Short Sellers Change Course According to the Wind</p>
<p>It is rumored that there is a long position company organization. Yarn prices have rebounded and are particularly tight this month.</p>
<p>The yarn market has been trending firm this month, and the wind of price increases has started again. It is rumored that a long position company organization has been formed for the February period, ready to fight. As a result, short sellers are concentrating on covering their positions for this month and simultaneously shorting the February period. Previously, the price for this month was small, so there were many arbitrageurs. Therefore, the spot market for this month is dry, and there is only one day of trading left tomorrow. Many are closing out their floating positions, and the market is rising. Although 2,400 bales of spot yarn were traded this month, fellow traders accounted for 1,300 bales, buying January futures to prevent a short squeeze.</p>
<p>Short Sellers Covering Delivery Positions</p>
<p>The pre-market opening of the yarn market saw the near-month contract being pulled up by buyers, causing tightness on the floor. Floating traders covered their positions, and the market slowly rose. With only today and tomorrow remaining for trading this month, short sellers have already covered their delivery positions and shifted them to the February period. Therefore, the recent momentum has been strong. However, the forward months saw a decline in the price of third-grade yarn due to sluggish yarn sales and fewer buyers, while spot yarn business became even more sluggish. The results of the auction showed that the near-month contract rose by one to one point three yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and the forward months rose by three point six jiao. In the afternoon opening, the near-month contract was covered by short sellers for profit-taking. The market condition gradually tightened, but the forward months remained peaceful. After one round of trading, the near-month contract continued to advance, rising over fifty yuan. The results showed that the near-month contract rose by one point five yuan to eight jiao, and the forward months rose by two point three jiao compared to the morning closing price. The sellers included Changfeng with 1,150 bales, Taichang with 1,500 bales, Dafu with 850 bales, Xincheng with 750 bales, Hexing with 1,600 bales, Wang Taixing with 800 bales, Dachangcheng with one hand of bales, Hengchang with 900 bales, Dachang with 1,000 bales, Yongchang with 600 bales, Changji with 700 bales, and Senkang with 1,250 bales. The buyers included Fukang with 1,100 bales, Jifeng with 1,600 bales, Yuda with 1,050 bales, Mingde with 900 bales, Gengfeng with 1,700 bales, Runkang with 1,550 bales, Xiecheng with 900 bales, Yuan Yi with 1,300 bales, and Tonghe with 650 bales. A comparison of market prices is shown below:</p>
<p>Over Two Thousand Bales of Spot Yarn Traded</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. Statistics for all gangs buying period spot yarn throughout the day show 2,403 bales traded, with a price increase of one yuan. Shangyin spot yarn traded 540 bales. The purchase amount for each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Market Has Little Glory or Shame</p>
<p>The cotton market is dull and lifeless, with no glory or shame to speak of. Therefore, the ups and downs are minimal, and the market state is increasingly stagnant. Overseas American and Indian cotton markets are also in a state of hovering and hesitation, so there is even less color.</p>
<p>Cotton Prices Do Not Deviate Much, Only Five Fen or One Jiao Up or Down</p>
<p>The pre-market opening of the cotton auction saw a slight increase in each month's contract, but trading in the market was particularly quiet. Both the long and short sides lacked excitement, so buying and selling were very rare. The overseas cotton industry situation also did not escape the tired state. The results of the cotton auction showed that each month's contract rose by five fen to one jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, the market situation did not change at all, fluctuating five fen up or down, with very little trading. The results showed that the February and March contracts fell by five fen to one jiao compared to the morning closing price, and the rest remained unchanged. The sellers included Xinchang with 1,200 dan, Yongda with 1,600 dan, Changyu with 1,000 dan, Dachangcheng with 1,100 dan, Jiankang with 1,300 dan, Changhe with 6,300 dan, Yuanda with 1,100 dan, and Jinghua with three hands of 400 dan. The buyers included Tongji with 2,100 dan, Deda with 1,000 dan, Dafu with 3,100 dan, Yukang with 2,400 dan, Jinchang with 1,100 dan, Changfeng with 1,800 dan, Shengyuan with 1,300 dan, Fengtai with 1,400 dan, Renfeng with 1,000 dan, Yuan Yi with 2,100 dan, Hengchang with 2,100 dan, Yikang with 1,000 dan, and Shenji with 1,200 dan. A comparison of market prices is shown below:</p>
<p>Tongyao Cotton Arrives, 3,400 Bales</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is mediocre, and factory sales are not smooth. Sources: Yao cotton 2,186 bales, Tong cotton 1,218 bales. Haiti tip, 48.75. Hengfeng factory import, 300 bales. Spot goods delivered to the factory, Lingshi cotton, 67.72. Zhongxin factory import, 420 pieces. Also, again.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth Dividends Set New Records</p>
<p>Semi-annual Surplus, Dividend of Twelve Yuan Per Share. Brokers' Profits Exceed Tens of Thousands to Two or Three Hundred Thousand.</p>
<p>The business situation of the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange in the 25th year was particularly developed, and the income increased sharply, creating a new record for the 15 years since the establishment of the exchange. The second half of the year's business was even better than the first half. The accounts have already been settled, and a dividend of eleven yuan per share has been distributed. On the broker side, profits were also substantial. The largest profit earners made 260,000 yuan, and those with surpluses of 230,000 yuan were even more numerous. Cotton merchants were slightly inferior in comparison, but they were also considered not bad. The reason for the improvement in business is that the bond and securities markets trended dimly, and the target of general speculators shifted and gathered in the yarn and cotton market. Therefore, the waves were particularly large, and market prices rose and fell rapidly. Cotton yarn had a price range of 75 to 76 yuan, and cotton had a change of 8 to 9 yuan. On the whole, it was the most satisfactory year in the history of the exchange.</p>
<p>US Cotton Industry Limits Purchases</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and the market situation was firm but lacked activity. Each month rose or fell by one pound note. The near-month contract was particularly firm due to the limited-price orders from fellow traders. In general, fellow traders are waiting for the official announcement of the cotton loan issue. As a result, the spot and futures markets are all clear, and new accounts are flat. The footing of low-grade spot cotton is increasingly soft, and the closing is firm. The spot price is up two pound notes, and the futures price is unchanged to up two pound notes. British spot cotton fell six points, and futures rose one point. Indian cotton was initially weak due to re-sales by buyers, then firm due to retail long positions buying in. Finally, the market price softened again due to old long positions selling off. The Pingguo letter fell 1.25 to 1.5 rupees, Aomula fell 1 to earn rupees, and Bai Luo Creek fell 1.15 rupees. Original telegram left, (22nd telegram).</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 23rd is that Bai Luo Creek is 225 rupees, and Aomula is 205.5 rupees, down 0.25 rupees. Pingguoer is 178 rupees, unchanged.</p>
<p>The Price of Third-Grade Yarn Falls, but the Price of Cotton Still Rises</p>
<p>On the 23rd, Dagu telegram: Spot yarn fell 2.3 yuan. 16-count fan surface, 251 yuan, unchanged. 20-count goldfish, 270 yuan, down 3 yuan. 40-count five-star, 410 yuan, unchanged. 42-count pheasant, 398 yuan, down 1 yuan. Period yarn fell 0.6 to 1.7 yuan. The near-month is 268 yuan, and the forward month is 255.4 yuan. Period cotton rose 0.15 to 0.6 yuan. The near-month is 75.9 yuan, and the forward month is 77.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Foreign Wheat Quotes Fall, Flour and Wheat Market Suddenly Weak</p>
<p>The rebound started slightly in the afternoon. The near-term flour market is still flat.</p>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, each month's contract showed signs of first falling and then rebounding. This was because the price of foreign wheat, Chicago, fell 0.8 yuan in the near term, 0.4-0.5 yuan in the long term, and Canada fell 0.3-0.6 yuan. Liverpool fell 2 pence. When the opening price was set, the market sentiment deteriorated because the trend of foreign wheat was unstable and the price gradually loosened sharply. Therefore, the opening price for this month was as low as 3.815 yuan, February to 0.84 yuan, March to 0.885 yuan, and April to 0.925 yuan, a severe drop of 0.6-0.7 yuan compared to the previous day. It was convenient for each trading floor because most of the long positions were dull, and the short positions followed the market to advance, so the price was set. Until the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere was still flat this month because the delivery was approaching and the long positions had no strength to mutually dismiss. However, the forward months were tighter because the factory output was not prosperous and the floating short positions were large. Outsiders also took the opportunity to raise prices slightly, so they tightened again, rebounding 0.3-0.4 yuan from the lowest price in the morning. However, the subsequent situation still looks small domestically, but the central hub is still shifted by the good news from abroad.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, each month's contract showed a weak and lifeless market. The price of foreign wheat fell again by 0.2-0.5-0.6-0.8 yuan, and 1 penny. Domestic sales are not smooth, and foreign countries are also gradually loosening, which inevitably makes the long positions embarrassed. Therefore, the opening price for this month and January fell 0.1 yuan, and the decline for March and below was worse due to very lonely trading, a small loss of 0.6-0.7-0.8 yuan. Until the afternoon opening, it was also very tired at first, and then the flour market rebounded, and the market sentiment also turned high. Because some of the short positions in the industry were anxious to cover, the market rose 0.6-0.7 yuan. The spot wheat market fell again, and the asking price also loosened 0.6-0.7 yuan, opening Jiangbei wheat at 6.11 yuan, and Chongming wheat at 6.08 yuan, down 0.4. It is estimated that over 2,000 bales were opened.</p>
<p>The US and Argentina Are Expected to Have a Good Wheat Harvest</p>
<p>On the 22nd, the Chicago wheat market fell 1.5-2.5 fen due to the weakness of foreign markets, the settlement of floating long positions, and the extremely poor factory demand.</p>
<p>The Chicago wheat market trended down last week. A total of 11,436,000 bushels of wheat were loaded in the Southern Hemisphere during the week. Affected by this, prices plummeted. According to last year, Argentina's wheat shipped out about twice this number in one week. With the arrival of goods pouring in, market prices will undoubtedly be under pressure. However, the world's needs are very large. If Germany and Italy both need wheat, it may be able to offset this adverse force. The domestic factory demand is extremely poor. The outlook for the new wheat harvest is improving. The condition of wheat seedlings is above average, so it is expected that the wheat market will continue to rebound. However, some merchants are still bullish on the long-term outlook for wheat.</p>
<p>Customer Xian Canton Helping Cutbacks Suddenly Reduced</p>
<p>The Market Price Rebounds Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of customer Xian continued, and the market inventory was even more abundant. However, the Canton help's appetite suddenly decreased. Yesterday, only more than 1,000 bales of Jiangxi machine brown rice were processed in the evening. The appetite on this street was also weak, with an estimated 2,000 bales processed. In total, less than 4,000 bales were traded. Therefore, the market price fell slightly by 0.5-0.6 fen to about 0.1 yuan. The rise and fall in the later market still depends on the digestive strength of the Canton help, because other customer helps are all receiving east at the end of the year and have no intention of getting involved, and there is no smooth appetite on this street either.</p>
<p>River Rice Transactions Are More Sluggish Than Before</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various helps turned into more partners than before, with a total of about 70 numbers, about 15,500-15,600 shi of goods, including more than 30 numbers of thin rice. The sales market on this street is still sluggish. The stomach is only Qingdao helping with 1,500-1,600 bales of thin rice, which leads to a weak situation, and the market situation is still difficult to support. As a result, the price of thin rice continues to fall by 0.1-0.2 yuan, and the price of thick japonica rice falls by a few fen to 0.1 yuan. According to the current situation, it seems that it is still difficult to gain a foothold. Du Yangjian is slightly soft, and Yin Bian Yuan Yi is changing because the price is higher and the arrival is surging, resulting in a sudden drop of more than 0.2 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 50 sources from various rivers downstream. The sales of various goods in the market were more sluggish than before. However, the white japonica rice moved slightly by four scattered households, the price of white japonica rice was 0.1-0.2 yuan smaller, the price of early thin rice was nearly 0.1 yuan smaller, the price of white yuan was 0.7-0.8 yuan smaller, the supply of Yangbu Jian goods was scarce, and the price was flat and weak. The price of other goods was also slightly weak.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake Sales Are Still Not Bad</p>
<p>Returning to the soybean cake market situation two days ago, the market sentiment was inevitably weak because the Dalian market situation was still softening, so the market situation was being repaired. However, the go-down route is still not bad, because the general merchants are keen on arbitrage, and the Shantou help is ordering period cake tirelessly, so the market atmosphere is still in a stable situation. Yesterday, the market opened with 3,000 pieces of spot 4-brand cake, 15,000 pieces for delivery in February, and 10,000 pieces for delivery in March. The market price is now in the repair score, February is unchanged, but March is the only setback of 0.02 yuan.</p>
<p>The Rise in Oilcake Prices in the Twenty-Fifth Year Was Unmatched</p>
<p>The Transaction Was Less Than in the Twenty-Fourth Year</p>
<p>Since the reform of the currency system, domestic prices of all kinds have been advancing day by day. Vegetable oils are necessary items in the world's war preparations, so the local soybean oil price, under the sudden rise of the Dalian market, followed the trend. In November and December, the sharpness of the rise was a change unprecedented in years. However, although the price rose sharply, the number of open transactions in the market for the whole year was actually one-tenth less than in the twenty-fourth year (listed below).</p>
<p>(Note) Each commodity is listed with two prices, the former being the market price in the 25th year and the latter being the market price in the 24th year.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Government Bonds Are Mainly Short Covering and Swapping</p>
<p>Gradually Presenting a Short Squeeze Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday's government bond market was the last two days of the January period. The market situation was gradually showing a short squeeze due to the covering of short positions and active swaps. Floor trading was quite active, and there were still many large households selling and absorbing, resulting in a strong stalemate and forming a near-weak and far-strong trend. Tomorrow is the last day of the futures for this month, and the long and short sides will still be crushed at the time, but the firmness of the market sentiment can be a short squeeze. Yesterday morning, the opening trend was still weak. No. 4 had a daily outflow of each item, and many retail investors bought it. Except for Grade E, which was slightly better by 0.05 yuan, the rest fell 0.1-0.2 yuan. In the second round of trading, the market situation turned high. A lot of 35.44 etc. were bought, and the retail appetite became more intense. Grades E and B recovered by about 0.1 yuan. Grade A forward fell by 0.1 yuan due to continued sales in No. 4. In the afternoon opening, swap trading turned strong. 38.47, etc., and retail investors were mostly short swaps. 35.72, etc., were still buying. Grade C fell 0.1 yuan next month. Others such as B and A rose another 0.1-0.2 yuan. The closing still had a slight short squeeze trend. Floor swappers became more crowded, and market prices rose another 0.05-0.1 yuan. Grade A fell by 0.02 yuan. The overall result was that the recent unified bonds rose 0.1-0.2 yuan, and the forward months all fell by 0.05-0.1 yuan. The total number of transactions was 8,785,000 yuan. The comparison of its rise, fall, high and low is listed on the left. (Unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Black Iron Sheet is Out of Stock and Very Popular</p>
<p>Thin Iron Opens at 75 Yuan</p>
<p>Black Iron Sheet. Recently, the goods arrived are very little because the set price has soared and few traders have bought them. But the go-down route is such that enameled factories, thermos factories, etc. have successively collected them, resulting in fewer inventories being purchased. Standard is rising section by section due to environmental relations. At the moment, a 2 ft., 6 ft., 18 sheet piece is sold for 13.5 yuan per knot, 1 yuan better than before. 3 ft., 6 ft. are sold for 15 yuan per dan, also 1.5 yuan better than before. It seems that the goods arriving are not many, the city inventories are weak, and the later market may be difficult to recover slightly.</p>
<p>Thin Iron. Yesterday the opening price has reached 75 yuan. It is said that cigarette factories, biscuit companies, etc. have successively collected them, so the market situation is excellent. The opening price is not easy to fall temporarily because the market sentiment is extremely good.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Shanghai Factories Are Waiting for Prices to Sell</p>
<p>Recently, silk prices have risen and fallen repeatedly, and both buyers and sellers are hesitant. As a result, domestic and foreign silk transactions are light. Yesterday, the New York silk market, Japanese silk 83 and 75 degrees, each fell 0.04 yuan, Shanghai silk 78 degrees and Guangdong silk each fell 0.05 yuan. The exchange's market price, March fell 0.03 yuan, and July fell 0.025 yuan, an average decline of 0.11 yuan compared to the previous weekend, equivalent to a decline of 48.88 yuan per dan in the Shanghai market. Yokohama spot prices rose slightly by 2 yuan yesterday, while futures fell by 2 yuan. In the Lyon silk market, various types of raw silk have risen and fallen against each other, but the number is very small, only an increase or decrease of 0.5 francs. In the Shanghai silk market yesterday, foreign merchants, seeing that foreign silk prices were firm, weak, and unstable, mostly took a temporary wait-and-see attitude. On the Chinese side, because there is not much silk in stock domestically, they are all holding prices and waiting for opportunities, unwilling to sell lightly. It is expected that the silk market will temporarily stop. If overseas silk prices can recover substantially next week, then the Shanghai market situation will not be difficult to expand. Yesterday, both domestic and foreign silk sales were only sporadic transactions, totaling only 22 bales.</p>

The transactions of Chinese Zhejiang Province Pingshui and Anhui Province Luzhuang colorless green tea are very active. Among them, Fengmei Zhenmei Zhucha and other items are particularly smooth-selling. Many merchants took the opportunity to replenish the shortage, but due to the report from Shanghai that the inventory was empty, it is said that New York tea merchants, seeing that the supply of Chinese tea could not meet the demand, have successively widely imported Japanese tea. Since the beginning of the year, the number of Japanese Zhenmei Zhenmei two green teas imported into the United States has been more than 37,000 boxes, and they are still being ordered in a continuous stream.</p>

It is said that Japanese thin fancy tweed serge has been slightly bought and transported to.</p>

<h3>Income Tax Office Hosts Representatives from All Sectors Yesterday to Explain the Significance of Implementing the New Tax</h3>
<p>Transforming the Foundation of Public Finance by Building Upon Direct Taxes; Adjusting the People’s Burden to Make it Fair and Universal; Chamber of Commerce Representatives Hope for Uniform Implementation for Both Chinese and Foreigners</p>
<p>Since its implementation, the collection of income tax by the Ministry of Finance has proceeded smoothly. For the sake of facilitating its promotion, various sectors have convened meetings for research. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce even held an Income Tax Research Conference, inviting representatives from chambers of commerce in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as various trade associations in the city, to contribute the results of their research to the authorities. Liang Jingchun, Weng Zhiyong, and Zhang Miao, responsible persons from the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Department, hosted a tea party at the New Asia Hotel on the seventh floor at 5 PM yesterday to entertain the attending representatives and facilitate networking. They also invited representatives from the Party headquarters, chambers of commerce, and the press to participate and exchange ideas. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Liang's Report</p>
<p>Yesterday’s tea party was attended by Qian Sunqing, Gu Suming, and other representatives from the Income Tax Research Conference, as well as Tao Baichuan from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Ke Ganchen from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Lin Kanghou from the Municipal Bankers' Association, accountants Xu Yongzuo, Pan Xulun, Xi Yushu, and over 250 other people. The director of the Affairs Department, Gao Bingfang, and the deputy director, Liang Hejun, personally hosted the event. During the tea party, Liang Hejun first gave a report, stating that since the implementation of the income tax, it has received the support of all sectors and its implementation has been smooth, which is very gratifying. He also expressed his admiration for the sincere research conducted by various sectors to further improve the collection methods. He said that income tax is a good tax system, which need not be elaborated on. However, everyone believes that there are still difficulties in its implementation and hopes that the government will adopt the opinions of all parties. Therefore, the government adopts a lenient attitude in implementation, as the purpose of implementation is to cultivate tax sources and establish a good tax system, not to focus on the amount of tax and harass the people with harsh levies. He hoped that the people, especially businessmen, would believe in and abide by the system, and that Chinese businessmen, who have always valued credit, would be able to promote it, enrich national power, and enhance the country's status. He then invited Director Gao to speak and hoped that everyone would express their opinions.</p>
<p>Mr. Gao's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Gao said in his speech that he was very honored to have representatives from the Party Headquarters and the business community from various places present. The implementation of income tax requires the efforts of the people of the whole country, especially Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai, which are the wealthy areas and the center of industry and commerce in China. He briefly reported the significance and process of the government's adoption of the new tax as follows: ⑴ The four major policies decided by the financial conference: 1. Abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes; 2. Determine county and local budgets; 3. Consolidate old taxes; 4. Promote new taxes. The first two points, based on the economic situation in China in the past three years, although of great importance, are still passive work in the entire process of consolidating local finances and cannot achieve positive results. The third point is more meaningful, but it still has a somewhat conservative tendency and cannot be called an innovative undertaking. The last fourth point is the positive and progressive facility. The promotion of income tax is the initial step in this facility, so its significance is very important. ⑵ The significance of promoting income tax: 1. Create a direct tax to transform the direction of China's financial foundation. From China’s finance, which is built upon indirect taxes, the promotion of income tax will gradually transform the financial foundation to be built upon direct taxes. 2. Reform the tax system and improve China's tax system. The existing old taxes in China are mostly inherited from the past, and there are many criticisms of the tax system. It is hoped that the promotion of income tax will further rationalize and improve the tax system. 3. Adjust the people's burden and measure the ability to pay taxes to make it fair and universal, in line with tax principles. China’s taxes have always been unequal, with the poorer bearing a heavier burden. Income tax is levied based on ability to pay, with those with greater ability paying more, those with less paying less, and those without the ability to pay being exempt. In summary, the implementation of income tax can be described as a major reform that marks a new era in the history of Chinese finance. Moreover, the tax system is equal and fair, treating Chinese and foreigners equally without discrimination. ⑶ The current firm and unchanging policy for handling income tax: 1. Make as much use of scientific methods as possible to handle all affairs, so that tax administration is not infected with bad habits. 2. Absolutely appoint new talents to handle this new undertaking with a new spirit. 3. Accommodate the opinions of the people as much as possible. Regarding the discussion of many events in the collection of income tax, an audit committee will be organized, inviting impartial talents from various places to form it, so that taxpayers have the opportunity to participate and express their opinions, so that the government and the people can reach a consensus through mutual understanding. Based on the above three points, there are now concrete facts that can be reported. First, the collection system has been greatly reformed. The collection system of income tax is absolutely separated between collection and receipt of funds. Second, the organization of tax authorities is extremely simplified, and expenses are minimized, so that the maximum effort can be used with the minimum expenditure to do the most work. ⑷ Expectations for the national business community: 1. Hope for prosperous business and profits for merchants, so that tax revenue will also be abundant. 2. Hope to improve bookkeeping to make it easier to audit. On the one hand, the business community can more accurately budget for their own operations, and on the other hand, the government can easily handle it. 3. Hope that the people of the whole country will support the government in promoting the new tax, and even more hope that merchants will support the new good tax, on the one hand to seek smooth implementation, and on the other hand to increase strength, so that in addition to the unanimous and enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country for the good tax, equal tax payment for Chinese and foreigners is achieved, in order to enhance the international status.</p>
<p>Representatives' Speeches</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the speeches of representatives from various sectors: ⑴ Tao Baichuan said that the implementation of income tax is a necessary condition for realizing the Three People's Principles. 1. It is in line with the principle of the People's Livelihood, as income tax is levied based on the people's ability to pay, the people's burden is average, and tax revenue is increased to develop the national economy. 2. The realization of the People's Rights requires a capable government and people with rights. Therefore, the government must have sufficient economic capacity to collect taxes, but the people must have the right to supervise. Income tax can achieve this goal. 3. From the perspective of nationalism, in order to seek national strength and freedom and equality in international status, and to recover lost territory to raise eyebrows in the world, considerable preparation is necessary, and economic strength is especially a good plan. China's finances have always relied on customs duties and salt taxes, but once something happens, they will collapse. Only income tax can avoid this kind of difficulty in times of national crisis. Therefore, to complete the Three People's Principles, it is necessary to implement direct taxes. ⑵ Ke Ganchen said that merchants have already been implementing income tax and are now seeking to improve accounting for easy calculation. However, there are several requests: 1. If there are inconveniences in the implementation of the new tax, after research and proposals for revision are submitted, it is hoped that the government will adopt them as much as possible. 2. If disputes arise during implementation, it is hoped that the government will not harass merchants when investigating. 3. The audit committee was originally stipulated in the regulations, and it is hoped that it will be established as soon as possible. 4. It should be implemented uniformly for both Chinese and foreigners, but we should strive to implement it as an example. 5. It is hoped that the government will use the collected funds for domestic construction and foreign defense, without wasting a penny. ⑶ Qian Sunqing said that there is no question that the people support the new tax. However, in implementation, it is hoped that: 1. The habits of the people will be taken into account. 2. The penalties will be revised. 3. It will be implemented uniformly for both Chinese and foreigners. 4. Unfavorable tax revenues will be reduced in the future to lighten the burden on the people. There were also speeches by Lin Kanghou and others, which are omitted for brevity. The guests and hosts parted happily at about 7 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Third Day of the Income Tax Research Conference</h3>
<p>Completed Discussions on Salaries, Remuneration, and Interest on Deposits; Accounting Issues to be Discussed This Afternoon</p>
<p>The Income Tax Research Conference convened by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its second group meeting at 10 AM yesterday and continued the plenary session at 2 PM to discuss the second category of salary and remuneration income and the third category of securities deposit interest income. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Group Meeting</p>
<p>At 10 AM, the group meeting was held, attended by Qian Sunqing, Chen Ziyi, Chen Weiwen, Wang Yonghai, Wang Jiean, Qian Xuchu, Kong Shushen, Xu Yongzuo, and Yan Esheng. Chairman Qian Sunqing resolved the following cases: (A) Regarding the parts submitted by the general meeting for discussion: ⑴ Bad debts, in addition to actual losses during the business period, should include reasonable forecasts of bad debt losses in accounts receivable at the time of settlement. Resolved: Please add an item "reasonable forecasts of bad debt losses" to Article 19 of the asset valuation method of the Ministry of Finance. ⑵ If a legal person invests in real estate without the purpose of making profits, can the income be deducted when calculating net profits? Resolved: Those concerned should handle it at their own discretion. ⑶ Current accounts of stores have deposits and debts, which are different from fixed deposits. It is requested to be exempt from interest income tax. Resolved: Request the Ministry of Finance to add the seven characters "and other industrial and commercial" under "branch stores" in Article 4 of the third category of collection instructions. ⑷ Proposed by the Silk and Satin Industry Association: Store accounting should still retain the cash basis system. Resolved: Request the Ministry of Finance to allow businesses that cannot settle profits and losses or pay in installments within an accounting year to settle according to the cash basis. (B) Regarding the second category of salary and remuneration: ⑴ Tax is levied on salaries starting from 30 yuan, which is too low. It should be changed to tax from 50 yuan. ⑵ The second category of tax rates is too progressive, with too few levels and too large differences between each level. ⑶ There are too few tax exemptions. It should be increased: (A) In addition to statutory savings funds, all kinds of mandatory savings funds should be tax-free. (B) Life insurance premiums should be tax-free. (C) Copyright royalties should be tax-free. The above four items should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for separate amendments and supplements.</p>
<p>Research Meeting</p>
<p>At 2 PM, the research meeting continued, attended by 153 representatives. Wang Jiean was the chairman, and Ye Zhizhong was the secretary. After the chairman reported the minutes of the group meeting, it was resolved that, except for the item on the cash basis, which should be re-submitted to the group meeting for research, all other items were passed. The following cases were then discussed: ⑴ Proposed by the Hardware Parts Industry Association: Article 5 of Chapter 2 Tax Rate of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations should reduce or exempt the minimum necessary living expenses when taxing salary and remuneration income. Resolved: This case has requested the Ministry of Finance to tax salary and remuneration starting from 50 yuan, which can be relieved. ⑵ Proposed by the Cotton Trading Industry Association: Suppose a firm has a net profit of 100,000 yuan at the end of the year, of which 20,000 yuan must be distributed to partners as remuneration. Should the net profit portion be taxed at 80,000 yuan? If the tax is paid according to 100,000 yuan, the 20,000 yuan distributed to the partners must still pay income tax according to the second category regulations of the Income Tax Regulations. Is this a double taxation? Resolved: Request the Ministry of Finance to amend Article 12, Section 2 of the first category of collection instructions and delete the nine characters "through managers and other employees." As for the receipt of the partner's personal share, the subject is different, and the tax should be paid according to the regulations. ⑶ Proposed by the Sauce Garden Industry Association: Piecework or per-piece wages cannot determine the average monthly or daily income, so how should the taxable amount be calculated? Resolved: Piecework wages are based on the piece as a unit, and one piece may not be made by one person. There are no regulations in the current regulations, so no tax needs to be paid. ⑷ Small tax amounts are carried to the tax collection agency every month, which requires travel expenses. Please ask the Ministry of Finance to change the procedure and allow them to be paid every six months. Resolved: Passed. ⑸ Proposed by the Timber Industry Association: Should the salary of a sole proprietor who also serves as a manager have a certain standard? Resolved: It should be determined by itself according to the actual situation. ⑹ Proposed by the representative of the Silk Edge Industry Association: Can the entertainment and communication expenses incurred by a sole proprietor who also serves as a manager for business needs be used as expenses? Resolved: If there is a bill, it can be used as an expense. ⑺ How should sole proprietorship stores that have always been responsible for expenses internally and cannot provide independent accounting be handled? Resolved: The store accounts and family accounts should be separated. ⑻ Proposed by the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce: Should the interest income on deposits in foreign banks be taxed uniformly? Resolved: Passed. ⑼ Proposed by the Hardware Industry Association: The interest income on deposits is taxed uniformly at 5%, which is unfair. It should be changed to a progressive system. Resolved: Submitted to the group meeting for research. ⑽ Please expand the scope of tax exemption for statutory savings funds and labor savings funds. Resolved: It has been requested that mandatory savings funds should be exempt from income tax. ⑾ Representative Chen Ziyi of the Bean and Rice Industry proposed to correct item 13 of yesterday's resolution to be: All kinds of industrial and commercial enterprises that should pay various income taxes that have the nature of withholding should be given one-fifth of the handling fee in accordance with the example of the silver and money industry to show fairness. Resolved: Passed. ⑿ The presidium proposed that this conference express its respect to accountant Xu Yongzuo for attending every day to answer questions and provide careful guidance. Resolved: Passed. It was decided that a public banquet for accountant Xu Yongzuo would be held at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road on the seventh floor at 12 noon on the 25th of this month, and souvenirs would be presented to express gratitude. Each group or company should pay a fee of 5 yuan, which must be paid when the next meeting is held. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. Moreover, the research conference will continue to be held this afternoon (24th) at 2 PM to discuss income tax and accounting issues.</p>

<p>Special Cash Guarantee Method is Both Legal and Reasonable and Suitable for National Conditions</p>
<p>Financial leader Qian Xinzhi said yesterday regarding the issue of reforming bank employee guarantees that the issue of bank employee guarantees is of great importance, as everyone knows. Recently, the Bankers Association researched the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" proposed by Wang Weizhou (Mr. Wang is currently the Secretary and Head of the Personnel Department of the Head Office of the Bank of Communications). After reading it carefully, he felt that it combined the spirit of guarantee, insurance, and savings. Employees no longer have the difficulty of seeking guarantees. The guarantee deposit exists in the bank, without the trouble of tracking and pressing for payment. Monthly on-the-job employees share a part of the responsibility, which can disperse the risk and has a mutual assistance effect. This can lead to the effect of joint supervision, which is both legal and reasonable and suitable for national conditions. Compared with the guarantor system, limited guarantees, and credit insurance, it is much better. However, when implementing it for banks with a smaller scope and fewer employees, it may still be necessary to make some modifications. It is reported that the chairman of the Bankers Association, Chen Guangfu, reported that the research results of the association believe that it is practical and feasible and decided to promote it. In the future, it will be promoted and implemented successively so that the guarantee system in our country can be established perfectly. I believe that the creation of a new system is nothing more than making it a fact in theory. However, to seek the expression of facts, it is especially important to have the spirit of reform, implement it resolutely, and strive for perfection in the process of implementation. The improvement of all undertakings is probably the same example. It is hoped that people in the financial industry will not only pay attention to this issue but also work hard on the implementation, so as to seek a new construction for the financial industry. I have also advised Wang Weiguo to collect various employee guarantee systems at home and abroad, add comments, and use the experience of the past two or three years to publish a special book for those who study this matter, so that the beneficiaries will not only be the banking industry.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Can Communicate with the UK and the US in the Near Future</h3>
<p>Trial Calls with New York Resulted in Excellent Results</p>
<p>The China Press reported that in the near future, telephone users in Shanghai can pick up the handset and talk to friends in London or New York in a few minutes. At present, the trial of commercial communication with the UK and the US by wireless telephone every day is about to be completed. It is expected that at least one of the two places can be connected by the end of next month. This new business must be connected with the wireless machine of the Chinese government before it can be opened. Once the negotiations currently underway between the Chinese Ministry of Communications and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company are successfully concluded, the American side can be connected and can use the Bell system to call any location in the United States through the Pacific Ocean. The traffic with London will be direct, taking the route through Asia and the European continent. In early February, another important wireless telephone business can be announced, that is, Shanghai is connected to Guangzhou and Hong Kong through Guangzhou. The trial work of this route has been successful. According to Shanghai Telephone Company officials, the trial of the American route has been completely satisfactory. Talks with New York have been held in recent days with excellent results. Someone in Shanghai was connected to New York in less than a minute on one occasion. After that, the conversation was clear and uninterrupted. Several trials have also been conducted by the Zhabei Chinese Telephone Bureau. This call requires adding a duplex machine to the existing mechanical equipment so that after the conversation is over, if there is anything unclear, this machine can be used to repeat it.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Sent Three Telegrams Yesterday</h3>
<p>Petitioning the Central Government to Wipe Out the Rebels and Admonishing the Northeastern Soldiers to Return to the Right Path</p>
<p>The joint meeting of various organizations in this city petitioned the Central Government yesterday to quickly use all its strength to wipe out the rebels to consolidate the foundation of unity and resist regret, and admonished the northeastern soldiers and Sun Weiru and others to return to the right path as soon as possible to preserve the vitality of the country. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Petitioning to Punish the Rebels</p>
<p>To the Central Party Headquarters of Nanjing, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission: Since the Xi'an Incident occurred, all parties, from the court to the countryside, have been grieved and indignant and have unanimously given advice, hoping that they would turn around and repent. However, recent news has come that Yang Ni is not only without any sincerity of repentance but is also colluding with the Red Bandits to concentrate his rebellious troops and attempt to resist the Central Government. It can be seen that his ambition to betray the Party and harm the country has been clearly revealed. It seems that such a willful and unrepentant attitude should not be tolerated any longer. At a time when the national crisis is serious and the border troubles are tight, the rebel does not consider the difficulties of the time, colludes with the Red Bandits, shakes the foundation of the country, and raises paralysis enough to cause trouble. Tolerating it is suitable for condoning the treacherous. If Qingfu is not eliminated, Lu will not end. Suppressing the Red Bandits is by no means a civil war. We should quickly order the division and wipe out the bandit atmosphere. The country and the nation really depend on it. The public groups in this city are willing to lead 3.8 million people to pledge to be the government's backing. The telegraph is overwhelmed with resentment. The Joint Conference of Shanghai Public Groups kowtows.</p>
<p>Admonishing to Return to the Right Path</p>
<p>Admonishing the northeastern soldiers and Sun Weiru and others to return to the right path telegram says: (Titles omitted) Since Yang Ni Hucheng's Xi'an rebellion, offending the superiors and causing chaos, the whole country was shocked, and letters and telegrams were rushing to give bitter advice. The central government is also based on the spirit of cherishing national power, making long-term and broad tolerance. The rebel should have followed public opinion and repented strongly, but he stubbornly insisted on private wisdom and self-use, colluding with the Red Bandits to destroy unity. His dimness, cunning, and brutality have reached this point. Our people all have the determination to resist regret and resist the enemy and save the country, how can we allow him to betray the country and the Party, to reverse the heart of the world with one person, and to be the enemy of the whole country with his body. Success or failure, gain or loss, why wait for the turtles? Right and wrong, obedience and rebellion are obvious. How can all the generals not see it? It is said that good birds choose the origin to perch, and virtuous officials choose the master to serve. How can all the generals not know it? Modern soldiers are raised by the circle of the family and obey the orders of the government. Although the officials have changed, obedience to the government orders remains unchanged. Today, Yang Ni betrays the Party and the country and isolates himself from the people of the country. He should not accept the chaotic orders again and help the tyrant. Moreover, it is an evil habit of feudal soldiers to be disloyal to the country and loyal to a person's surname, which is not what the current soldiers should do. I hope my friends will identify the right and wrong, obedience and rebellion, and resolutely return to the right path and punish the rebels, then not only will you win the extraordinary merits of the upper reward, but also you will be recorded in history and fragrant for thousands of years. Those who are ignorant of the righteousness and willingly attach to the rebellion will not be tolerated by national laws and Party discipline, and the punishment will not be able to be regretted. I hope all the generals will plan well. I hereby submit my words, I hope you will consider and kowtow.</p>
<p>Telegrams to the Whole Country</p>
<p>All agencies, organizations, and newspapers in the country are informed that this meeting has just submitted to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission to quickly use all its strength to wipe out the rebels, and admonished the northeastern soldiers and Sun Weiru and others to return to the right path as soon as possible. The article says (see above). Please unanimously advocate punishing the treacherous and maintaining the foundation of the country. This is specially reported for your consideration. The Joint Conference of Shanghai Public Groups kowtows.</p>

<h3>Northeastern Compatriots Under Japanese Puppet Control</h3>
<p>Those coming to Shanghai from the Northeast report being at risk of arrest at any time.</p>
<p>The "Zi Lin Bao" reports that according to people newly arrived in Shanghai from the Northeast, any Chinese residing in the northeastern provinces who frequently receive letters from mainland China are suspected by the puppet Manchurian authorities and are at risk of being arrested and interrogated at any time. Letters entering and leaving the region are now subject to strict inspection. Most Chinese are now advising their relatives and friends in mainland China not to send letters unless it is absolutely necessary to avoid suspicion by the puppet Manchurian inspectors. Chinese in Manchuria, whether rich or poor, are now filled with unease. Gentlemen and the wealthy, and those with some reputation, are often monitored by the authorities for no reason. Those who usually do not wish to associate with Japanese or puppet Manchurian officials are suspected of being reactionaries and are arrested. It is heard that from the beginning of February, the puppet Manchurian government will launch a major purge of so-called reactionary and ideologically impure elements. Anyone with the slightest suspicion of being reactionary, or even those who usually hold a cold attitude towards the puppet Manchuria, will be subject to strict monitoring and thorough investigation. The puppet Manchurian government has recently forcibly merged small villages into larger defensive units, calling this a "national defense plan." Any village that receives a notice to merge with another village and does not immediately comply will be burned to the ground without mercy. The newly merged villages are all built with solid defensive works, and villagers are forced to dig trenches. The expenses for the defensive works must be borne by the villagers. In the past, defensive structures were mostly built in strategic locations and on mountain ridges, but now they are spread across the plains, forming a large defensive network. Every eight miles, a watchtower and signal station are built. In addition to the telegraph network and long-distance telephone lines that have already been completed, underground telegraph and telephone lines are now being installed to cope with any sudden changes. To facilitate the transportation of large armies, the main roads that are considered important to "national defense" are all resurfaced with gravel and other hard materials.</p>
<h3>The Bank of Communications Held a Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Insufficient number of attendees, a provisional resolution was passed to increase capital.</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications held a temporary shareholders' meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the bank's conference room on the third floor of Number 7 on the Bund. There were 210 shareholders present, representing 17,783 voting rights and 21,727 shares. Chairman Du Yuesheng attended and reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the bank had been in operation for 41 years, but due to the failure of old shareholders to fully pay up their capital, business could not fully develop. Therefore, the board of directors convened today's shareholders' meeting to discuss methods of increasing capital. Subsequently, due to the insufficient number of shareholders present to meet the legal quorum, the proposals were treated as provisional resolutions: (1) The unpaid capital of 3.5 million yuan for all shares of the bank will be reduced because the old shareholders are unable to pay. (2) In order to develop business, the board of directors is authorized to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to allocate government shares. The board of directors will submit a request to increase the discount on old shares. (3) A second temporary shareholders' meeting will be convened within half a month to vote on today's (i.e., yesterday's) provisional resolutions.</p>
<h3>Records of the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee at 97 Renji Road received a letter from the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Association stating that the association has been establishing temporary winter shelters in South Shanghai every winter to accommodate poor and unemployed civilians, and they are dismissed separately when the weather warms up in the spring. Now that winter is approaching again, it should be held as usual. The expenses of the shelter rely entirely on fundraising. We have received donations from you in the past, benefiting the poor. This year, the market is even more depressed, there are more poor people, and it is more difficult to raise donations. Your enthusiastic relief efforts have always been admired. We still hope that you will generously donate to help with relief efforts. The merit is immeasurable, etc. Also received a letter from the Qingjiangpu Pu Hui Congee Factory stating that the factory has been subsidized by your committee over the years, benefiting disaster victims. The years have passed without us knowing. In the blink of an eye, the winter season has arrived again, and we plan to prepare for distribution immediately. This year, the harvests in various provinces are very good, but the Huaibei area is remote and has mostly low-lying land. This autumn, it first suffered from drought, followed by rain and fog. The harvest is not as good as in other places, and there are many people without land or jobs. The so-called barren land and poor people mean that every winter, even in years of good harvest, there are still many people eating congee at the factory. Therefore, we are writing to respectfully request that you continue to help with funds and clothing, etc., so that we can broadly save the hungry people. The merit is truly immeasurable, etc. Also received a letter from the Anhui Provincial Capital Disaster Children's Education and Shelter stating that the shelter has been accommodating disaster children for two years. Teaching and shelter are combined, and the scale is roughly complete, but there are no funds. We rely entirely on the support and assistance of various great philanthropists. All achievements and income, donations, and expenses are recorded in the report in the first anniversary publication. We hope to receive your attention. However, since the anniversary, because the disaster children have no homes to return to, if they are dismissed, they will inevitably still fill the ditches, which is far from the original intention of relief. The colleagues agreed to change it to an education and shelter, and reported to the government for approval to register. We have tried our best and continue to raise funds until now. We are exhausted. Thinking that our shelter has been maintained by your association in the past, we should receive relief in the future, so as to avoid 200 disaster children being displaced. Now, we specially recommend Chuan Jun Erkang and Rui Jun Xiaocen to come and explain everything in person, hoping that you will consider the good deeds of caring for children and complete them from beginning to end, and donate to save the urgent situation, etc. It is heard that the association has been providing assistance to the above associations every winter. Now that we have received the letter, we held another meeting yesterday and decided to allocate 4,000 yuan to the temporary shelter, 2,500 yuan to the Qingjiangpu Hui Congee Factory, and 1,000 yuan to the Anhui Disaster Children's Education and Shelter to assist and help the poor, etc.</p>

<h3>Smallpox Spreads in This City</h3>
<p>507 patients last week, 20 deaths, affecting Zhuzhou</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of smallpox in this city, it has caused extreme concern in various ports in other cities, and Shanghai has been declared a smallpox-infected port, all of which have been reported in the newspapers. A Datong News Agency reporter recently learned from the Harbor Quarantine Station that smallpox in this city is spreading more and more, and the number of deaths has increased sharply. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Smallpox Spreads</p>
<p>A reporter learned from the Shanghai Harbor Quarantine Station that since the outbreak of smallpox in this city, it has not subsided slightly. Recently, it has spread more and more severely. According to the station's investigation, in the past week (i.e., the week before midnight on the 16th), the number of people infected with smallpox in Shanghai reached 57 (including 4 foreigners), and 20 people died of smallpox. The severity of the outbreak and the seriousness of the situation should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Spreads Throughout the City</p>
<p>It is also learned that the areas where smallpox patients were found last week included 28 people in the First Special District, with 16 deaths, 12 people in the Second Special District (no deaths), and 18 people in the city, with 4 deaths. According to the above-mentioned areas and their figures, the spread of smallpox in Shanghai is spreading throughout the city, which is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Affects Hangzhou</p>
<p>Due to the proximity and convenient transportation between Shanghai and Hangzhou, smallpox in Hangzhou has also been affected. Two cases have been found last week. There is no news from other places yet. At the same time, passengers from Shanghai's outer ports will still be prohibited from landing if they have not been vaccinated against smallpox at the Shanghai Port Quarantine Station and issued a vaccination certificate. There are many difficulties and delays.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau Introduces Domestic Products</h3>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau yesterday, the bureau recently received several letters from domestic and foreign countries requesting domestic products. They are now published for the reference of various manufacturers to ask the guidance department of the bureau for introduction. (1) Nathan A.

<h3>This City Detains Drug Offenders and Executes Them by Shooting After Approval by the Military Commission</h3>
<p>Smokers in various districts surrender especially enthusiastically. Concession authorities cooperate in arresting drug offenders.</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Department is actively carrying out the work of banning smoking and drugs in the urban area. The Concession authorities are also assisting in the investigation and arrest. If drug offenders are arrested in the urban area, they will be sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for approval by the Military Commission and then executed by shooting. Smokers have been surrendering to the valley district offices and requesting treatment for addiction in large numbers in recent days. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Detain Drug Offenders and Submit for Approval to be Executed by Shooting: According to Section Chief Dai Lizhen, the deadline for banning drugs ended at the end of the 25th year. If anyone is arrested for producing, selling, or consuming drugs in the urban area this year, the bureau will send them to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation. If the facts are verified and the case is tried according to law, the details of the case must be submitted to the Military Commission for approval before the execution by shooting. As for North China, due to the special situation and environment, the responsible authorities may submit it to the Jicha Political Affairs Committee for approval and then execute it by shooting on the spot.</p>
<p>Surrender Smokers Especially Enthusiastically: After the forced registration of smokers in this city ended at the end of last December, the police stations in various districts stepped up the investigation and arrest of unregistered smokers. At the same time, they implemented household guarantee certificates, which have been very effective. In order to give smokers in the city one last new opportunity, the Municipal Police Department still allows unregistered smokers to voluntarily quit. Therefore, smokers in various districts have been surrendering and applying for smoking cessation in large numbers in recent days. Now that the smoking cessation hospitals are trying to increase the number of beds, smokers can be accommodated as much as possible.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Cooperate Seriously: A Datong News Agency reporter also learned from the Huazu Concession authorities that the Concession authorities have not negotiated and implemented the central government's strict ban on smoking and drugs in terms of administrative sovereignty, but they are seriously and unremittingly carrying out the work of cooperation in the investigation and arrest. Therefore, there are also a large number of smokers in the area who voluntarily apply for smoking cessation at the Municipal Police Department and the nearby districts.</p>
<h3>The Third Branch of the Higher Court Builds a New House</h3>
<p>Annual rent of one yuan in national currency</p>
<p>Yang Peng of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, considering that the court's office is inconvenient to borrow private houses and that it costs the national treasury, is now planning to negotiate with the French authorities to rent the vacant land east of the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court. After a successful negotiation, a new court building will be built. The method has been repeatedly negotiated with the French Public Works Bureau and the landlord. The value of the rented land is one yuan per year in national currency, with a term of 50 years. The negotiation is now in progress and is expected to be completed soon. After this plan is negotiated, the president of the court plans to submit a request to the Ministry of Justice for the designated funds to be allocated for construction costs, in order to implement the construction as soon as possible and open a new court office.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yugao, a "Big Painted Face" Actor, Has a Nervous Breakdown and Cuts Three Men and Women With a Knife</h3>
<p>Empty toilet seat on Li Wu's head. Zhou Zhou and others were injured and sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>Zhang Yugao, an actor, is 40 years old and from Tianjin. He specializes in playing the "Big Painted Face" and partners with the famous actor Xiao Yang Yuelou to perform at the Huangjin Grand Theater. He originally lived in Xiao Yang Yuelou's home at No. 12 Renchang Lane, Kaizi'er Road, French Concession. Zhang has a wife, and all the money he earns each month is managed by his wife. Unexpectedly, after Zhang's wife died, the money that was successively handed over for management</p>
<p>Was all gone</p>
<p>Even without the ability to handle the funeral, Zhang was stimulated by this. Later, friends and others, considering that Zhang had suffered the grief of losing his wife and that there were many inconveniences in his family, raised funds again to allow Zhang to remarry. Who knew that the person who entered the door was a scoundrel who soon ran away without a trace. Zhang was stimulated twice, causing a nervous breakdown. He often quarreled at home, so he stopped performing and stayed at home to recuperate. However,</p>
<p>Because of his mental disorder</p>
<p>Xiao Yang Yuelou and his family couldn't stand his noise. After friends accompanied Zhang to temporarily live in the Liyuan Guild Hall in Xima Bridge in the city, they were treating him. The guild hall also couldn't stand Zhang's noise, so Zhou Zhou (58 years old, from Changshu), an old woman living at No. 23 Dingning Lane, Ailaige Road, French Concession, introduced Zhang Yugao to rent the remaining stove shed at the home of Li Wu (60 years old), an old woman from Suzhou at No. 30 Dingning Lane, for a monthly rent of five yuan. He moved in on the 12th of this month and has been living peacefully until now. Who knew</p>
<p>At four o'clock yesterday morning</p>
<p>Zhang's nerves suddenly went haywire again. Because the door was latched from the outside (the sub-landlord was entrusted by the introducer, fearing that he would cause trouble outside, so he latched the door from the outside to prevent accidents), he couldn't open it, so he shouted loudly and made noise in the room. At that time, the sub-landlord Li Wu got up when she heard the noise and opened Zhang's door to comfort him nicely. Zhang</p>
<p>Became foolish</p>
<p>Not only did he ignore her, but he also put the empty toilet seat next to him on the head of the sub-landlord Li Wu. Wu took off the toilet seat and ran to shout for the introducer Zhou Zhou. Zhang had already followed out with a kitchen knife. Seeing the introducer Zhou Zhou walking in front and the sub-landlord Li Wu walking behind, Zhang immediately</p>
<p>Cut with a knife</p>
<p>Zhou Zhou's arms and then ran out of the lane. At that time, a rickshaw puller Tao Xingzhi (from Jiangbei, living at No. 56 Daxing Street outside Ximen) parked his rickshaw at the entrance of the lane. Zhang wanted Tao to pull the rickshaw to a certain place. Tao saw that Zhang was talking nonsense and ignored him and wanted to pull the rickshaw away. Zhang immediately reached out and grabbed Tao, cutting Tao's head with a knife, causing him to bleed. Zhang then let go and ran to the pancake shop at No. 96 opposite. The shop had just opened its door. Wang, a pancake baker from Shandong, was lighting the coal stove. Zhang cut Wang's right hand with a knife. After Wang was injured, he</p>
<p>Twisted Zhang</p>
<p>With one hand and had the fierce knife snatched by bystanders. He called the police to come and send Zhang to the police station. Detective Wu Wengang was dispatched to investigate. At the same time, Zhang Yugao was sent to the Tairaste Road Public Works Bureau Hospital, and the injured were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The case will be reviewed after they recover.</p>
<h3>Two More People Released in the Jingyun Building Robbery Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lu Baozi and Han Xiaolong</p>
<p>Since the Liu Jingdetang robbery case at the Jingyun Building on Beijing Road on New Year's Eve last year, the chief patrol room in charge has been arresting the relevant criminals. So far, 22 people, including Wang Jinsheng and Chen Rongsheng, have been arrested, and three pistols and more than ten bullets have been seized. Among them, Xu Honglin and Lu Xiumei were found to be unrelated and have been submitted to the First Special District Court for approval to release them. The rest are being held for investigation, all of which have been reported in this newspaper. The patrol room investigated and found that Lu Baozi and Han Xiaolong, two of the criminals, were also not related. Therefore, the patrol room's lawyer Ru Bao-yi requested the Special First Court yesterday to stop the detention. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he immediately ordered that Lu Baozi and Han Xiaolong should be released immediately.</p>
<h3>Qi Xinsheng Denies Assassinating Xu Libing</h3>
<p>Six Hundred Thirty Cash Can Kill a Person: It Wasn't Buying a Knife and Wine, But Seizing a Knife and Returning It</p>
<p>Qi Xinsheng, a worker at the Zhenye Sock Factory in Tanjiachiao, Zhabei, was dismissed after being reported by foreman Xu Libing for poor performance. Qi requested reinstatement from the factory, which was granted, but Xu refused. On December 1, 1936, Qi carried a</p>
<p>sharpened pear knife</p>
<p>and stabbed Xu Libing to death. The police arrested Qi and handed him over to the District Court Prosecutor, who filed a public prosecution. Xu's widow, Madame Xu Fan, also hired lawyer Xu Qinnan from her hometown to file a civil lawsuit, seeking 1,000 yuan in compensation for funeral expenses and consolation. Yesterday, Liu Bojun continued the interrogation. Madame Xu Fan testified that the deceased was her husband, and the family includes a 72-year-old mother, three sons, and a daughter. "With my husband murdered, the old and the young are left with nothing to live on!" She</p>
<p>burst into tears in court</p>
<p>and further stated that her husband, in his dying moments, told her sister, Qian Xu, that Qi Xinsheng was incited to kill by Hu Chengkui and Shen Shigen. Hu Chengkui is an accountant at the iron factory and is currently under investigation by the prosecutor's office. Qian Xu testified in court that her younger brother, Xu Libing, was stabbed once in the right abdomen and once in the right hand by Qi Xinsheng. Falling to the ground, he</p>
<p>cried to me,</p>
<p>"My intestines are severed, I cannot live. Please avenge me!" Qi, after committing the crime, told the police that he spent 330 cash to buy a knife and 300 cash to drink a cup of wine, saying that 630 cash can kill a person, boasting proudly. Therefore, she requested a severe punishment. Xu Liming, the deceased's brother, testified that he worked in the same factory as his brother. In March, his brother introduced a female worker, and Hu Chengkui, the factory's accountant, lured her to a hotel for illicit relations. When the female worker's family found out, his brother fired her, leading to a feud between Hu and his brother. Hu wanted to ruin his brother's business and promote Qi Xinsheng to foreman. Because his brother had worked at the factory for eleven years,</p>
<p>he was trusted by the manager</p>
<p>and was not dismissed. Qi Xinsheng had stopped working at the factory and later requested to return. His brother agreed to reinstate him on the 21st, but before the 21st, Qi Xinsheng stabbed him to death. He requested a thorough investigation. Witness Tang Jinhua testified that while working at the factory, Xu Libing and his sister Qian Xu were talking when he heard a cry for help. He went outside and saw Qi holding a knife, stabbing Xu once before running away. Xu chased after him, and Qi stabbed him again, causing him to fall to the ground. Questioned about this, the defendant Qi Xinsheng stated, "I never said anything about buying a knife and wine. It was actually seizing a knife and returning it. Please investigate." The official then adjourned the investigation for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Gentleman Mo Zijing Has No Heirs, Frequent Lawsuits Over Inheritance Rights</h3>
<p>Mo Benhou Requests Confirmation that Mo Runkun Has No Inheritance Rights; Mo Runkun Countersues that Mo Benyuan's Inheritance Is Invalid</p>
<p>The late Shanghai gentleman Mo Zijing had no children during his lifetime, only a daughter named Runzhu, an old maid who died before her father. Because of his love for his daughter, Mo Zijing adopted Shen Jinglin as his daughter's heir, renaming him Mo Benhou. After Mo Zijing himself passed away, Mo Benhou inherited the property as a grandson. However, Mo Zijing's cousin Mo Runkun, claiming to be the appropriate generation, sought to be adopted as an heir. The lawsuit has lasted for years, and mediation has been attempted by the surviving old gentlemen, but Mo Benhou hired lawyers Wang Bushang and Ling Qihong to sue in the District Court for confirmation that Mo Runkun has no inheritance rights. Mo Runkun hired lawyer Tang Hao to countersue for confirmation that Mo Benhou's inheritance is invalid and that he has no right to sue. Yesterday, Judge Cao Baozhen opened the court. Regarding the witnesses who have passed away, including Shanghai gentlemen Yao Zhirang, Xu Fenglin, Ye Liwen, and Hu Jusheng, they could not be present. Lawyer Wang stated the previous situation, and lawyer Yu Yuan testified that he represented Mo Zirun when the settlement was signed, while they had hired lawyer Yu Dianhua. Because Yu was in Songjiang, Lu Bohong gathered people at Puyutang for Mo's family matters and invited me to dinner. Most of the people present were Shanghai gentlemen. As for the lawyers, it was me, Qu Yue, and Yu Dianhua. Yao Zhirang announced that it was a matter of Mo Zijing's inheritance, not a legal issue, and asked the lawyers present not to speak. I wanted to speak, but Yao said that everyone was an old friend and would talk after dinner, but there was no further development. Then, witness Mo Benzhong stated that Mo Xilun was his grandfather and that his grandfather handled Mo Zijing's funeral arrangements. Witness Mo Boyang testified that he was of the same clan. After Mo Zijing's death, Mo Zhu signed a settlement contract. Mo Zhaoxiong, Mo Xiqin, Mo Xilin, Mo Zigang, Mo Jiaquan, and I were present, and each received 2,500 yuan, and would not ask about it afterward. Mo Benhou was adopted by Mo Zhu. At this point, the official stated that the plaintiff's lawyer would present the original handwriting and will of Mo Zijing in the next hearing. The case will still be attempted to be resolved through reconciliation out of court and will be adjourned for one month for further questioning.</p>
<h3>The Truth Behind the Arson at the Prosperous Clothing Company on Fuzhou Road Is Revealed</h3>
<p>Wu Ziliang Lost Money and Planned; Goldfish Tanks Were Filled with Gasoline; Huang Changgen Admitted to Conspiring to Share the Profits</p>
<p>The Prosperous Clothing Company at No. 548 Fuzhou Road was opened by the Wu brothers, Wu Ziliang and Wu Songsen, from Suzhou, with a capital of 18,000 yuan. It has been in business for more than nine years and is one of the older clothing stores in the Fuzhou Road area. It had fire insurance of 50,000 yuan, with 15,000 yuan from Shenchang Foreign Company, 14,000 yuan each from British and Great Eastern Companies, and 7,000 yuan from Lulin Foreign Company. Recently, due to the sluggish market, business at the Prosperous Company has been slow, resulting in significant losses. This year alone, losses have amounted to over 10,000 yuan, making it difficult to maintain. The company's accountant, Zhang Kuibo from Zhejiang, met a friend named Lin Mapi at the Tianyunlou Amusement Park in June last year. They discussed the company's losses, and Lin suggested setting a fire to obtain a large amount of compensation. He introduced Huang Changgen from Zhenjiang to Zhang, saying that Huang was skilled in arson and had exceptional methods. Zhang was tempted, and he and Lin and Huang repeatedly discussed the matter at Tianyunlou and Tongyuchun Teahouse. However, due to manager Wu Ziliang's incomplete agreement, it was delayed until now. Zhang was determined to carry it out, so on the 13th of the month, he gave Huang 150 yuan to purchase items for arson. On the 17th and 19th, using the alias Zhang Dezhi, he booked Room 112 at the Juelu Hotel and invited Wu Ziliang to persuade him to agree to the arson plan. As a result of the discussion, Wu agreed and promised to give Huang a reward of 9% of the compensation for every 100 yuan. On the night of the 21st of the month, Huang brought over a dozen goldfish tanks filled with gasoline to the Prosperous Company. At 2:40 a.m., he poured gasoline on the wool and reed mats and set them on fire. The fire quickly became fierce. The fire department received the report and immediately dispatched fire trucks to extinguish the fire, which was quickly put out, fortunately without spreading to neighboring houses. Afterward, the Old Zhabei Police Station dispatched Chinese Detective Lu Gengsheng, Investigator Feng Xiushan, and Western Detective Mike Fei to investigate. They discovered that the fire at the company was indeed arson and began to make arrests. Zhang Kuibo was arrested first. Based on Zhang's confession, Huang Changgen and Wu Ziliang were also arrested. Because Zhang and Huang's confessions involved Wu Songsen and insurance broker Chen Jianian from Ningbo, they were also arrested. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. After the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the case, he requested permission to detain the defendants for further investigation. Judge Qian Hongye interrogated each defendant separately. Zhang Kuibo, Wu Ziliang, and Huang Changgen all confessed to conspiring to commit arson for compensation. Wu Songsen claimed that although Zhang Kuibo invited him to the Juelu Hotel on the 19th of the month, he left after taking a bath and did not meet Huang Changgen or participate in the arson conspiracy. Chen Jianian stated that the company's insurance with Great Eastern was handled by his relative, surnamed Shen. Because Shen suffered from paralysis, he handled the matter on his behalf. After the Prosperous fire, he went to investigate due to his professional duties and was arrested, but he knew nothing about their arson. Judge Qian reviewed the confessions and ordered Zhang Kuibo, Wu Ziliang, and Huang Changgen to be detained for one week. Wu Songsen was released on bail of 1,000 yuan, and Chen Jianian was released on bail of 200 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Whereabouts of Foreigners Who Left Shaanxi Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Italian Priest Still Detained</p>
<p>North China Daily News reports that another group of foreigners, including six Italians, one Spaniard, and one Englishman, flew from Xi'an on an Eurasia Aviation Corporation plane on Thursday (21st). After departing at 11:10 a.m., they arrived in Nanjing at 5:45 p.m. on the same day. The 75 foreigners who arrived in Shanghai from Xi'an on Thursday morning are now residing in various places in Shanghai. Some of them are preparing to return to their home countries, while others will stay in Shanghai to wait for the situation in Xi'an to stabilize before returning there. The leader, Mr. Hill, is currently at the New Asia Hotel and plans to depart for Suiyuan after the week because his family is currently staying there. Mr. Hill participated in the Gobi Desert archaeological team from 1933 to 1935 and is accustomed to hard work. The foreigners' departure from Xi'an was due to his efforts. The foreigners who arrived in Shanghai on Thursday include citizens of England, the United States, Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.</p>
<p>The Continental Times reports that yesterday (22nd), the Italian Embassy in Shanghai received news that Father Sileni, an Italian priest stationed in Dali (100 kilometers northeast of Xi'an), Shaanxi Province, was detained by the Communists in Weinan. Embassy officials believe that the priest has not been harmed by the Red Bandits and is only being prevented from continuing his travels, being detained in a village near Weinan. The telegram was sent by the Italian Church in Shaanxi Province and also stated that the buildings of the Italian Church in Xi'an have been occupied by the rebel soldiers of Yang Hucheng's troops. A small group of Catholic priests remaining in Xi'an have not been disturbed. The buildings of the Italian Church in Sanyuan have been occupied by the Red Bandits. There is also an Italian Church in Tianli, which is currently quiet. It is also said that 17 Italian missionaries have left Xi'an by long-distance bus and plane for Luoyang. The Italian priests going to Beiping will be received by the head of the Italian Embassy there. Yesterday, churches and consular personnel in Shanghai were doing their best to find out the whereabouts of the eight missionaries who took the Eurasia Aviation Corporation plane to Luoyang on Thursday. Among them were six Italians, one Englishman, and one Spaniard. It was initially reported that the group had flown to Nanjing, but yesterday afternoon it was learned that they had disembarked in Luoyang. It is now believed that the Italians have gone to Beiping, and the other two may have taken the train to Shanghai (according to the North China Daily News, they arrived in Nanjing on Thursday afternoon). It was also learned last night that the only English missionary remaining in Xi'an has also left by long-distance bus and may arrive in Shanghai by train today.</p>
<h3>Japanese Marine Corps Marched on Various Roads Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 11:00 a.m., the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai held a grand parade, passing through border areas, including Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and North Sichuan Road, and the Caojiadu area of ​​Western Shanghai. The procession was headed by a Japanese military motorcycle team, followed by a truck with a Rising Sun flag erected on it, guarded by Japanese soldiers holding guns on all sides. Behind it were 14 trucks filled with fully armed Japanese soldiers. Finally, there were many motorcycles and several military officer cars. At the same time, a large team of Japanese Marine Corps, led by many Japanese military officers, paraded along Nanjing Road, the Bund, and North Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>Another Box with a Corpse Was Found in Lane 608, Yuyuan Road Yesterday</h3>
<p>Stone Steps Dug Up to Widen Car Access; Female Corpse Dismembered and Buried for Approximately Two to Three Months</p>
<p>A case of a female corpse in a box was discovered yesterday afternoon inside Lane 608, Yuyuan Road, at No. 239 Beijing Road, the China Reclamation Bank real estate. The discovery was due to the Tan family at No. 20 in the lane requesting the bank's real estate department to slightly widen the entrance and exit of the garage behind the house to allow cars to enter and exit. With the permission of the real estate department, at around 1:00 p.m. yesterday, artisans Yang Yukang, Tang Hongcai, and Wang Lijiang were assigned to move the bamboo fence in front of the empty house No. 40 three feet inward. Unexpectedly, after removing a few feet of the bamboo fence and turning over the cement stone steps about seven or eight inches down, the artisans suddenly saw a wooden box buried underground. At the same time, a stench rushed out, making people nauseous. The three artisans knew something was wrong and immediately stopped working and reported to the real estate department. At around 3:00 p.m., Zhang Yayong of the real estate department reported the case to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and assigned Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene for investigation. It was confirmed that there was indeed a wooden box, so the artisans were instructed to dig it out. It was seen that the surroundings of the box and the ground were covered with lime. The wooden box was about 31 or 32 inches long and about 18 or 19 inches wide. When the lid of the box was forcibly opened, there was a dismembered corpse, already rotten, with blurred and indistinguishable features. The Chinese and Western detectives reported the situation to the police station by telegram and summoned an ambulance to transfer the wooden box to the coroner's office for examination. It was learned that the corpse was of a Chinese woman, about five feet two inches tall, fully developed, with small feet and complete teeth. She was wearing a white cloth shirt, a blue cloth vest, dark gray cloth pants, white socks, and a gray wide elastic band. Only the neck seemed to have been constricted with a rope. Judging from the degree of decomposition, the corpse had been buried underground for two or three months. She seemed to be a maid before her death. The identity of the murderer and the reason for the murder are currently under investigation. It was found that the house No. 40 was previously rented by W.C. Foster, a British employee of the Yizhong Tobacco Company at No. 175 Suzhou Road, for about five or six years. However, Foster resigned and returned to his country on May 9th last year. The house was vacated long ago, and no one has inquired about it until now, so it has been empty for eight months. The origin of the corpse is very puzzling, and it is possible that the corpse was moved after the fact.</p>
<h3>Mail on the Old Shuchong Steamer Disaster Not Damaged</h3>
<p>Shanghai Post Office News: As for the old Shuchong steamer recently having an accident at Qingtan, the newspapers have already reported it. It has now been confirmed that all the mail carried by the steamer is safe.</p>
<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A (8)</h3>
<p>Q: ㊀ Newspapers, magazines, and other similar publications issued in various places are mostly printed on the cover with phrases such as "Registered by the China Post as an Ordinary Newspaper," or "Registered by the China Post as a Voucher Newspaper," or "Registered by the China Post as a Bulk Newspaper." I wonder what these mean. If it is not indicated, will the post office not treat it as a newspaper for mailing? ㊁ What are the differences between Ordinary Newspapers, Voucher Newspapers, and Bulk Newspapers? Is the applicant free to choose when registering, or are there any specific regulations? ㊂ Suppose there is a newspaper published once every Sunday. Each time, 440 copies are sent to various places in China, and 50 copies are sent to Japan, totaling 490 copies. Each copy weighs 10 centimeters. Can it be mailed as a Class One newspaper?</p>
<p>A: ㊀ According to Article 1 of the Publication Law, newspapers or magazines that meet the following conditions: 1. Published under a fixed name in a fixed location; 2. Numbered sequentially and issued regularly and continuously; 3. Not bound into volumes using leather, cloth, wood boards, or other durable materials; 4. Registered with the Ministry of Interior (except those exempted by law),</p>
<p>can be registered with the postal administration to which the place of publication belongs as Class One (i.e., Ordinary Newspapers, also known as Common Newspapers), Class Two (i.e., Voucher), or Class Three (i.e., Bulk) newspapers, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 159 to 174 of the Postal Regulations. After registration, it should be indicated on the cover of each newspaper or magazine for identification. If not registered, the post office can only accept it as printed matter. ㊁ Regarding Class One, Two, and Three newspapers, each has its own regulations. Newspapers or magazines mailed sporadically by the public or newspaper offices are Class One. Newspapers stipulated in Article 1, Paragraph 2, Item 1 of the Publication Law, mailed by the publisher at the post office in the place of publication, with each mailing consisting of 500 copies or more, and each copy weighing 10 centimeters or more, are Class Two. Newspapers stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Publication Law, published in Chinese daily or every other day, and mailed by the publisher in the place of publication to the newspaper's managers in other places within 24 hours after publication, bundled according to the place of delivery, with each bundle containing at least 50 copies, to be collected by the respective managers upon arrival, are Class Three. Therefore, when newspapers apply for registration, they must consider whether their own conditions meet the requirements of which category, and register according to that category, not arbitrarily choose. The different rates for each type of newspaper are detailed in the various postage rate tables. ㊂ It should be mailed as Class One, not as Class Two. The reasons are as follows: 1. Newspapers stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Publication Law refer to those published daily or at intervals of no more than six days. The current publication is once a week, exceeding the prescribed time limit. 2. Although each copy weighs 10 centimeters, the number of copies mailed each time is less than 500, which does not meet the number of copies stipulated for Class Two.</p>
<h3>Frontline Soldiers Need Shirts</h3>

<h3>Tong Yi Creditors' Meeting Adjourned Again Yesterday Due to Lack of Quorum</h3>
<p>Since Tong Yi Trust Company declared bankruptcy last year, it has convened several creditors' meetings. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the court convened the fourth creditors' meeting of the company's banking department. Only about 50 to 60 people attended. Judge Jiang Gongliang from the civil court and bankruptcy administrator Li Ding, a certified public accountant, took the stage to report that the amount of debt represented by the attendees was only 270,000 yuan, which was less than half of the legal quorum. Subsequently, various creditors and representatives, lawyers Dong Yu, Le Junwei, Zhang Yifan, etc., expressed their opinions one after another. Most agreed with the rehabilitation plan proposed by mediators Du Yuesheng, Chu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, etc. However, given the imminent Lunar New Year, creditors were in dire need of funds and hoped that the authorities would consult with the mediators to find a flexible solution within possible limits before the creditors' meeting passed the plan, allowing for a partial advance payment of cash before the New Year to provide relief. The presidium explained that this meeting was still adjourned due to lack of quorum and would be reported to the court for handling.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Local Goods Industry Association previously resolved to increase commissions on all goods by 1% starting from January 1st. The catering industry in West Shanghai and the vegetable industry in Hongkou, due to the economic downturn and without prior consent, consider the sudden increase in additional commissions difficult to bear. Therefore, they demand that goods companies in various places automatically cancel the increase; otherwise, they will collectively refuse to deal with them.</p>
<h3>Tugboat Operators Jealous, Stabbing Jin Genbao Repeatedly</h3>
<p>Intestines Almost Pierced, Blood Flowed Everywhere; Zhang Gensheng and Others Sued for Assault</p>
<p>Jin Genbao, a 31-year-old man from Suzhou, residing at 44 Yangsi Bridge, Pudong, made a living operating a tugboat for Xieshun Shipping. Zhang Gensheng, Shen Zailin, and others residing at Zhang's Residence, Yangjiadu, Pudong, worked for Xintai Shipping. Due to business competition and professional jealousy, at 10:00 PM that day, Zhang Gensheng, Shen Zailin, and six or seven others went to the Xieshun Shipping vessel at the Hubei Road South Wharf in the French Concession and repeatedly stabbed Jin Genbao with knives, causing severe injuries to his waist, back, and shoulders, almost piercing his intestines, and causing him to bleed profusely. The assailants fled in a panic. When the boat crew reported to the water patrol, police were dispatched to arrest them, but they were nowhere to be found. Yesterday, Jin Genbao was helped by his family to the District Court to file a complaint. Prosecutor Wu of the Fifth Section opened a court session, and after verifying the facts, ordered him to be treated at the hospital and to detain the defendants for investigation.</p>
<h3>Shen Xisheng's Nitric Acid Dousing, Sentenced to Five Years Yesterday</h3>
<p>Deprivation of Civil Rights for Three Years</p>
<p>Zhang Hengyan, a 33-year-old man from Suzhou, residing at 36 Sanxin Lane, Erlai Ge Road, French Concession, was doused with nitric acid by Shen Xisheng, a local, at the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao Street and Caishi Street at 10:00 PM on August 5th of last year, sustaining injuries. He reported the incident to the French Police Station and was sent to the hospital for treatment, recovering only after 161 days. In early December of last year, the French Police Station arrested the assailant Shen Xisheng and transferred him to the Second Special Court, where the police attorney prosecuted him according to the law. Judge Chen Shuoying held several hearings, concluded the case, and scheduled a sentencing date, as reported in the newspapers. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, Judge Chen presided over the First Criminal Court and sentenced Shen Xisheng to five years of imprisonment for causing bodily harm, with deprivation of civil rights for three years. He will be transferred to the detention center during the appeal period.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: Yesterday, I saw the news about the robbery at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory in your newspaper's local news column. Here is an excerpt from the report: "The day before yesterday (i.e., January 20th), at approximately 7:00 AM, Detective Zhu continued to apprehend three accomplices in the case inside the Shenxin No. 9 Factory at 140 Macau Road: Li Yunzhang from Tianjin, Yang Yaozhong from Chongming, and Zhang Ronghua from Anhui, etc. (omitted below)." The passage stated "Li is the watchman of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, and Yang Yaozhong is the warehouse keeper inside the factory, and Zhang is a worker, and they are all suspected of being involved in the robbery (omitted below)." Regarding the suspect Yang Yaozhong apprehended by the police, he is a stoker in the factory's furnace room, not a warehouse keeper inside the factory. Moreover, there is no such person as Yang Yaozhong among the clerks in the factory's warehouse section. The report is inconsistent with the facts. It must be a mistake in the pronunciation of "stoker" and "warehouse keeper." I am writing to request your newspaper to correct it as soon as possible. Sincerely, Shenxin Textile No. 9 Factory, Shanghai, January 23rd.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: On the 19th of this month, I hosted a reception for the members of the Guangxi Domestic Inspection Delegation on the eighth floor of Huaan Cooperative Insurance Company, where I work, due to my past association with them. Regarding the news published in your newspaper on the 20th, the statement that I am the manager is an error. I am writing to request that you correct it accordingly. Sincerely, Pang Tianjue, January 23rd.</p>

<h3>The Lesson of the Snail</h3>
<p>— De Lin</p>
<p>Little friends, in your usual studies at school, whether it's composition, arithmetic, calligraphy, or other subjects, you are often reprimanded by your teachers for poor performance. But don't think of this as a great humiliation and become discouraged. You just need to study each subject diligently. When you encounter difficult problems or unclear points in your textbooks, you can try to identify them and ask your teachers for detailed guidance, and then carefully remember them. If you can do this earnestly, then your knowledge and learning can naturally accumulate and become profound. If you don't believe me, I can give you an example now.</p>
<p>That is the snail on the wall. Isn't it slow when it moves upward? But it winds its way up, without being impatient, enduring patiently. However, its speed is unexpectedly very fast. Therefore, little friends, don't feel that you are not making any progress in your efforts to study. Now, looking at the events of the snail crawling on the wall, this can serve as your lesson and a good example.</p>
<h3>A Bitter Tear of a Primary School Student in Eastern Hebei</h3>
<p>— Hua Ming</p>
<p>I received a family letter a few days ago that made me feel infinitely sad. The cruel order to change textbooks in Eastern Hebei schools has been implemented. What is most distressing is that the policy of disguised book burning has also been used. All textbooks that primary school students have read in the past have been collected, and whether they are burned or not is not necessary to ask.</p>
<p>I know that Eastern Hebei is no longer a place for children to study. But my hometown is there—Tangshan, so I have to let my younger brother suffer temporarily. Moreover, he will graduate from a certain high school this summer and transfer to another place (Tianjin or Beiping). In this unavoidable situation, I often write to him, telling him to study diligently and not to worry about anything else.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, he sent me a letter. Before I finished reading it, my tears flowed involuntarily. My sadness was partly for the future of China and partly for the suffering of my younger brother. Here is what he wrote:</p>
<p>"Brother, you have repeatedly written to me, instructing me to study hard, and I am very obedient. But now I can't study even if I want to. Because my language, nature, and social studies textbooks for the fifth, fourth, and sixth grades have been taken away. Now I only have the fifth-grade language textbook they gave me, which is full of this and that, and those things. Reading it not only makes people angry, but also does not help my further studies at all. Brother, how can I pass the exam in the future? Please discuss it with sister-in-law quickly and let me come to Shanghai. Our hometown is really unlivable. The most terrible thing is those so-called advisors who often come to visit our school. When our teachers see them coming, their faces turn as black as coal, and their speech is poor, full of support...friendship...it's really ear-splitting to hear. So once, one of our classmates got angry and stood up to argue with the teacher. I don't know why that advisor slapped him twice in the face right away. We were simply furious. Brother, do you think we can still study this?..." When he wrote this, his letter was full of tears. I am his brother, how can I not sympathize?</p>
<p>Eastern Hebei is still in Chinese hands, and it is already like this. What will it be like in the future?</p>
<p>A thirteen-year-old child can send me such a letter, which is quite thoughtful! So I copied it down to reveal the tragic situation in Eastern Hebei now!</p>

<h3>The Mystery of the Intermediate Badge</h3>
<p>Reply to Zheng Wenying from Luoyang</p>
<p>Wenying, my brother:</p>
<p>Your willingness to go a step further and study Boy Scout lessons shows a learning attitude that is an essential element of success in your career!</p>
<p>Most Boy Scouts understand the meaning of the intermediate badge. They only know that the intermediate badge symbolizes a smiling face, and they only know the meaning of doing good and combining "Wisdom, Courage, and Benevolence," but they have not thought about the following three questions like you have:</p>
<p>㊀ Why does the intermediate badge have a reef knot?</p>
<p>㊁ Why is the reef knot connected to the badge that symbolizes a smiling face?</p>
<p>㊂ What is the relationship between the three words "Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage" and the reef knot below?</p>
<p>That's right, your question is very good, but these principles cannot be answered in the textbook. However, we can understand it using common sense.</p>
<p>To answer the first question, you must first remember the reef knot on your own neckerchief. The knot on the neckerchief must be tied every day when you wear the uniform for the first time. It will remind you to do good and encourage you to do good. But when you graduate to the intermediate level, your work will increase, and your responsibility to do good will also increase. At the same time, you must also be an example for junior Boy Scouts. Therefore, in addition to the reef knot on the neckerchief, you must also wear a badge with a reef knot, which means that you have an additional reef knot on your body, telling you that your responsibility is heavier.</p>
<p>To answer the second question, you will certainly think of our eighth law, which tells us to always wear a smile, but how can we always be happy? The only way is to help others! Because doing good is the source of happiness, Baden-Powell has told us this.</p>
<p>To answer the third question, the best thing to do is to do good. But we must also have the determination to do good. Please turn to the first issue of the monthly magazine published by the General Association. Zheng Yizhang of our company has a theory of doing good in there, and one paragraph says:</p>
<p>"Before doing good, we must first have adequate preparation, and we must also have the ability to judge good and evil in an emergency. This is the application of wisdom. But if we only have the wisdom to judge right and wrong and the strength to do good without a benevolent heart, we will not go further and try to use our own intelligence and benevolence to actively help mankind and protect living beings; otherwise, not doing what is right would be a lack of courage."</p>
<p>In this way, we can understand that to do good, we must give full play to the spirit of wisdom, benevolence, and courage. To be a young person of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, we should also fulfill our promise to help others!</p>
<p>We admire your attitude of seeking knowledge and hope that you will often correspond with us. Best wishes for progress!</p>
<p>China Boy Scout Mutual Aid Society respectfully replies</p>
<h3>Writing Before the Fifth Anniversary of "January 28th"</h3>
<p>— Da Haizi (Big Kid)</p>
<p>Dear little friends. I think you can't have forgotten this time five years ago, when a very prosperous Shanghai, considered the national industrial and commercial hub, was nearly completely destroyed by the rampant fighting. Although our soldiers fought bravely against the enemy at the risk of their lives, inflicting heavy blows on them, we ultimately suffered a great loss. Now, although the time that has passed since that cruel scene cannot be said to be long, it cannot be considered short either. But if we happily walk to Zhabei or Hongkou for a tour, those memories that can never be erased will float to the surface of our minds. Everywhere there are broken walls, a desolate scene, only increasing the sorrow of the visitors. Time accompanied all the melancholy, all the happiness, all the sorrow, and all the excitement that passed. At the same time, it also took away people's memories: those painful impressions gradually began to fade in people's hearts. One anniversary, two anniversaries, three anniversaries, four anniversaries, five anniversaries, ...even ten anniversaries. I believe that the days of blood commemoration will also slip away like time. From posting slogans, shouting slogans, publishing special issues, holding meetings, giving speeches...and, and to silence—eternal silence.</p>
<p>Now, it has been more than five full years since the loss of the four northeastern provinces, but for five years not only has the lost territory not been recovered, and national humiliation not been avenged, but the severity of the national crisis is even worse than in the past. However, fortunately, our country has now been unified, and it is time to settle internal affairs and resist foreign aggression. We firmly believe that the officials in charge of our government will have meticulous and comprehensive strategies for saving the country and promoting a plan for its revitalization.</p>
<p>The anniversary of January 28th has arrived for the fifth time. Although today is not January 28th, I would like to say a few earnest words before this anniversary. Because this annual commemoration must be held, we must understand the significance of this commemoration. At the same time, we should also earnestly take on the responsibility of saving and loving the country. I hope that everyone will work together with one heart to recover all the lost territory, wash away all national humiliations, and turn the national crisis into national prosperity.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a great metropolis of material civilization, but we must remember what Shanghai was like five years ago and what Shanghai is like five years after. If the January 28th Incident had not had our loyal and brave soldiers to resist, what would Shanghai look like today?</p>
<p>Dear little friends, now is a world where the strong eat the weak. If we want to preserve our motherland of five thousand years, and if our nation wants to survive in the future world, then we must all rise up and unite sincerely!</p>
<p>Remember! Walk on the bloodstains of the martyrs!</p>
<h3>Justice (1)</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>In the entire history of chivalry around the world, there are often admirable and moving deeds. Among them, those that arise naturally and are most touching are the actions of naval captains. They practically have a fixed tradition: if any accident occurs at sea, whether it be a fire or running aground, the captain must ensure that everyone on board leaves before leaving himself. In this critical moment of life and death, he completely disregards his own life. Many brave and righteous individuals have sacrificed their lives in this way, embracing death as if returning home. This spirit of righteousness and valor will forever exist in the universe, eternally immortal.</p>
<p>The coastal area of Newfoundland is a very dangerous place, because hot water flows through the sea channels, often causing dense fog to rise from the water's surface. This hot current originates from the equator and mixes with the cold currents of the Arctic, creating this evaporating atmosphere. Sometimes, the fog is so dense that day and night become indistinguishable, and nothing beyond an arm's length can be seen clearly. However, when viewed from outside the fog, it resembles a vast expanse of rocky mountains covered in glistening white snow.</p>
<p>On the morning of June 20, 1822, amidst such a terrifying fog, a brigantine sailing ship named the "Drake" suddenly struck a reef. The ship immediately tilted to one side, and waves immediately rushed onto the deck. Captain Begg ordered the sailors to quickly cut away the masts and rigging, hoping to reduce the ship's weight and restore it to its original position, but it was all in vain. One lifeboat had already been swept away by the waves, and another capsized as soon as it was launched. In the end, only the smallest boat, specifically for the captain's use, remained. The sailing ship was about to break apart and sink. The sailors' only hope was to reach a small reef, the tip of which could be seen rising from the sea, albeit vaguely through the fog. Its size could not be accurately determined, but hopefully it was not too large. One of the sailors, named Leonard, grabbed a rope and jumped into the sea, but the swift current was too strong and pushed him in the opposite direction. Everyone quickly pulled him back onto the ship. Then, another crew member named Donner volunteered to go ahead in the last small lifeboat, with a rope securely tied around his body. The sailors cheered as the brave crew member set off on his dangerous journey, all holding onto the rope on the ship, afraid to let go, as wave after wave pounded against the ship, threatening to shatter it to pieces. They earnestly watched Donner row forward, just a few feet away from the reef. In a flash, a huge wave swept in, lifting the small boat high into the air, then crashing it down onto the reef, shattering it into pieces. Fortunately, Donner did not lose his life; he still held tightly to the rope and climbed onto the rock.</p>
<h3>Puppet Show</h3>
<p>— Chen Tiejun</p>
<p>Small gong clang, clang,</p>
<p>The puppet show has begun its stage.</p>
<p>Look at them:</p>
<p>Putting on airs,</p>
<p>Their attitudes are so haughty!</p>
<p>Puppet, puppet, please be careful:</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, a young boy pulls the strings,</p>
<p>"When the birds are gone, the good bow is stored away."</p>
<p>I'm afraid that you:</p>
<p>In the end,</p>
<p>Will be chopped and diced for the pot.</p>
<p>Small drum boom, boom,</p>
<p>The wooden heads are so majestic.</p>
<p>Look at them:</p>
<p>Fully armed,</p>
<p>Relentlessly waging war.</p>
<p>A word to the wooden men, please listen:</p>
<p>"When the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked,</p>
<p>Please be careful!</p>
<p>The master pulling the strings behind the scenes."</p>

<h3>Gargling and Brushing Teeth</h3>
<p>— (Cheng Ming)</p>
<p>Children: You must gargle and brush your teeth every morning and after meals. These two health-promoting practices should never be overlooked or forgotten! Because gargling and brushing not only make your mouth feel fresh and your teeth clean, but they also prevent tooth diseases, ensuring that you can chew food easily and not interfere with your stomach and intestines' digestion. Therefore, we should pay special attention to oral hygiene and practice regular gargling and brushing.</p>
<p>The main components of teeth are calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. Calcium phosphate dissolves easily when exposed to acidic substances. Therefore, food residue left in the mouth during meals can easily turn into foul-smelling acidic substances, which are the teeth's greatest enemy. If something goes wrong with the teeth, it will hinder chewing and cause problems with the stomach and intestines' digestion.</p>

<h3>The Crisis of China's National Industry</h3>
<p>— Wei Li</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese industry has consistently been in a state of decline and bankruptcy. Due to the impact of the global economic panic, the brutal offensive of international capitalist imperialism, and the prevalence of natural and man-made disasters, the fragile foundation of national industry established during the European War has suffered exceptional damage and upheaval.</p>
<p>In the most recent period, we have continuously witnessed the closure and auction of Chinese merchant factories, and incidents of work stoppages and wage cuts have been endless. Conversely, imperialism has been expanding its power within China, inflicting a significant blow upon us.</p>
<p>To be convinced, we can examine several important national industries at the current stage.</p>
<p>First, let's take the cotton yarn industry, the most important in our national industry. We know that the cotton yarn industry is the center of our national industry, and it can also be said to be the most important sector of Chinese industry. However, this sector is currently in a state of extreme decline. Originally, the yarn mills in China were controlled by the forces of China, Britain, and Japan. According to a survey from the previous year, there were 96 yarn mills with Chinese capital, 44 with Japanese capital, and 4 with British capital. In terms of spindles, China accounted for 57%, Japan for 39%, and Britain for 4%. However, in the past year, Chinese yarn mills have closed down in large numbers. According to the "Zhonghua Daily" on August 16th, as of that time, the famous yarn mills that had closed nationwide included 8 in Shanghai, 4 in Tianjin, 4 in Wuxi and Nantong combined, and 1 each in Jinan, Qingdao, and Hankou, totaling as many as 19. In addition, work stoppages, wage cuts, reorganizations, and auctions have become common occurrences. According to the "Shen Bao Weekly," of the more than 2.7 million spindles nationwide, 31.5% were idle, 12.4% had already implemented wage cuts, and 1% was about to implement wage cuts.</p>
<p>At the same time, four of the six major yarn mills in North China have been acquired by the Japanese, and there are rumors that the remaining two will also be acquired. Conversely, at this time, the Japanese are expanding their factories in China with a large amount of capital. In Tianjin, the Japanese have added 800,000 spindles, and they are also expanding in Qingdao and Shanghai. Furthermore, a new factory has been established in Tongzhou. In the future, the number of Japanese spindles will increase to around 4 million, while our number of spindles will still be just over 2.7 million. Comparing the two, this is something to be very concerned about.</p>
<p>Let's turn to the silk mills. We know that the silk reeling industry is one of China's most important industries, but in recent years, it has almost completely collapsed. Because of the dual pressures of overseas markets and raw materials, its operations have been intermittent. In the first half of last year, due to the abundant harvest of spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the silk mills all resumed operations one after another. However, the autumn cocoon harvest was exceptionally poor, and coupled with the hoarding of large cocoon merchants, there was a great shortage of raw materials. Since the beginning of November, a total of more than 30 factories in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang have been shut down, and the remaining cocoons can only last until the end of the year. Before the spring cocoons come on the market, the factories will be unable to operate.</p>
<p>In addition, the large-scale smuggling of rayon and the dumping competition of others in overseas markets have further plunged China's silk industry into hardship.</p>
<p>Besides cotton yarn and silk reeling, the flour industry should be an important national industry in China, but this industrial sector is also very depressed. Recently, the market price of flour has risen sharply, and last year's wheat harvest in China was also abundant. It would seem that the flour industry could develop greatly, but in reality, this is far from the truth. In recent years, the most difficult problem for China's flour industry has been the issue of raw materials. Often, due to a lack of raw materials or a soaring price of foreign wheat, operations have been greatly affected. Last year's wheat harvest in China was indeed abundant. According to estimates from the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, the national wheat production increased by 49,806,400,000 "shi dan" compared to the previous year, and the barley harvest was 17,048,200,000 "shi dan," an increase of 8% compared to the previous year. Although this number is still not enough to supply the needs of domestic flour mills, it is much better than the previous two years. However, we still cannot enjoy this abundant harvest. Those who enjoy this abundant harvest are our friendly nations. Due to the large-scale purchase of grain by friendly nations in various parts of North China, there is a shortage of raw materials, and prices have also soared. As a result, factories have had to reduce operations in succession. "Factories such as Fuxin, Fufeng, and Yuxing are all in a state of intermittent operation with reduced work hours. In September of last year, Shanghai factories had already reduced the number of cars by 30%, and in October, they reduced it by 40%. Subsequently, there were many factories that suspended operations. As a result, the flour industry is still fraught with crises.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>In addition, industries such as the cigarette industry, the cement industry, the match industry, and the alcohol industry, although they have made some progress compared to the past, and have achieved considerable results in an absolute sense, they still need to be re-examined in a relative sense.</p>
<p>The national industry, which struggled out with great difficulty during the European War, is still in an extremely difficult position. Although we have only cited cotton yarn, silk reeling, and flour as examples, these three sectors can represent our national industry.</p>
<p>Why has our national industry suffered such a crisis? I believe that the main reasons are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>First, the loss of the northeastern provinces and the control of North China by others have greatly affected the vast market for our national industry. Before the September 18th Incident, the northeastern provinces were an important market for our industrial products, but now they cannot be utilized.</p>
<p>Second, the invasion of international capitalist imperialism, especially the smuggling by friendly nations, has dealt a heavy blow to our industry. According to customs estimates, in the five months from January to May of last year, the smuggling of rayon, cigarette paper, and sugar alone amounted to no less than 305 million gold units. The customs duty loss in April alone reached 8 million yuan. These smuggled goods are flooding everywhere like a flood, and they will certainly cause losses to China's industry.</p>
<p>Third, our national industry is not rationalized enough at present. Its organization, the supply of raw materials, and the coordination of production and sales all lack an overall plan, so it is inevitably affected.</p>
<h3>Aurora Borealis</h3>
<p>— Yan Xiang</p>
<p>People living in cities rarely notice the night scenery of nature, because they have been dazzled by the colorful lights of street lamps and trademarks. But those who live in the countryside can appreciate this unparalleled beautiful night scene. If you go to the far north of Russia, the coast of Norway, or certain parts of Canada, you can discover many never-before-seen splendors. These splendors are called "Aurora Borealis." Naturally, the South and North Poles also have "Aurora Australis," but because there is little land in the South Pole and no one has observed it, we will only talk about the Aurora Borealis here.</p>
<p>The aurora borealis can be seen in places closer to the Earth's magnetic axis, and the Earth's magnetic axis intersects the Earth's surface at the North Magnetic Pole. This North Magnetic Pole is located on Somerset Island in Canada, so that island is the most suitable place to view the aurora borealis.</p>
<p>There are mainly three shapes of the aurora borealis: arc-shaped, curtain-shaped, and long, streamlined-shaped. Its colors are usually tender green and tender yellow, but sometimes they are mixed with a little red and purple, which is very beautiful. When the aurora first appears, it is a serene and bright arch, with the top slightly deviating a few degrees to the west of true north. In an instant, the light radiates in all directions, as bright as a searchlight. This light continues to evolve and trembles and flickers non-stop. The local natives even believe that this is the light of their ancestors' souls. Sometimes the aurora stands upright like a curtain, and the folds of the curtain constantly change shape. This is indeed a fascinating spectacle.</p>
<p>The height of the aurora borealis, according to Stoermer's measurements in Norway, is 160 miles above the ground. Sometimes the top of the "streamlined aurora" can be as high as 250 miles above the surface, and we believe that the bottom of the aurora must be at least 40 miles above the ground. The height of the top of the aurora has been recorded as high as 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles).</p>
<p>Several people who have measured the aurora, including some, have said that they have personally heard the aurora make sounds that are unusually clear. Some say that the sound is like the rustling of silk banners fluttering in the wind, some say that the sound is like the scraping sound of a sharp knife rapidly swirling through the air, and others say that the sound is like the whistling of a ship's pulley being blown by the wind. This is called the "sound of the aurora." However, according to scientific research, this sound is impossible. Because the aurora is often in the high sky 60 miles away, and the speed of sound needs five seconds to travel one mile, then the distance of 60 miles will take five minutes to reach the ground. Even the lightning and thunder do not coincide when reaching people's senses, so the light and sound of the aurora are even more inconsistent. Also, the air is so thin in the high sky where the aurora is located, how can the sound waves be rhythmically and continuously transmitted into people's eardrums? Therefore, the claim that there is a "sound of the aurora" is still a question.</p>
<p>What gases make up the aurora? The spectrum of the aurora has been photographed, proving that the main component it contains is nitrogen. Nitrogen is the main component of air, and it is the same in this high sky. The aurora's spectrum also contains that famous green "light band," which is due to the surge of oxygen, or because oxygen is in an extremely active stage. Other gases such as neon, [omitted characters due to illegibility] also exist in small amounts in this high sky, and these gases, though few in number, are sufficient to increase the color of the aurora.</p>
<p>The aurora is very closely related to magnetism. If electrons are emitted from the sun to the earth, they will pass through space and be attracted by the Earth's magnetic field, until they pass to the vicinity of the South or North Magnetic Pole in the high sky, and present spiral circles, circling around the "magnetic lines of force." Electrons moving forward in a spiral gradually gather in one direction near the North Magnetic Pole, and produce the aurora borealis due to enhanced ionization. Similarly, those tending towards the South Pole become the aurora australis. However, whether the aurora australis and aurora borealis appear at the same time has not yet been studied.</p>
<p>The particles emitted from the sun have positively charged, negatively charged, and neutral particles, and the emission methods include electrons, positrons, neutrons, and so on. And these charged particles have the potential to move towards the north and south poles of the Earth.</p>
<p>After the aurora borealis appears, many people believe that the weather is gradually deteriorating, just as many people believe that the moon is related to the weather. In fact, different types of weather can be seen in different places at the same time. The region where the aurora can be seen is also very wide, and the weather in various places is naturally different. Moreover, the aurora is suspended in the high sky 50 to 60 miles above the ground, while the airspace that affects the weather is at most less than 10 miles, and the highest cirrus clouds rarely exceed 6 miles. However, one thing is worth noting: the aurora borealis can only be seen on a clear day. It cannot be seen on a cloudy or rainy day because it is covered by clouds and fog.</p>
<p>There are now many methods used to explore the high sky. One method is to use balloons. The balloon is launched high into the sky and allowed to burst on its own and fall to the ground. Then, we can measure the height, temperature, and humidity of the air where the balloon reached. Another method is to use searchlights, which can focus the light in the high sky. The analysis of the light can determine the various gases contained in the air. In addition, there is the use of radio waves. Radio waves are broadcast into the air, and the response returns in an instant, which can also be used to measure the conditions in the high sky. With the help of these methods, the study of the aurora borealis will be more accurate and rich in the future.</p>
<h3>Commentary on "Thunderstorm"</h3>
<p>— Da Dian</p>
<p>There is a Chinese saying, "Old wine in a new bottle." I think this saying is very appropriate to describe the play "Thunderstorm."</p>
<p>Since its debut, "Thunderstorm" has been performed dozens of times. In the past, due to the complexity of the plot and the emphasis on the characters' expressions, actors without deep theatrical training found it difficult and unrewarding to perform. Only after the China Traveling Theatre Company performed it did it cause a sensation. Every performance was a great success. This was indeed a triumph for the experienced and skilled professional actors of the China Traveling Theatre Company. The four-act play "Thunderstorm" itself also gained favorable reviews because of the China Traveling Theatre Company's performance.</p>
<p>In this chaotic era of ours, this era of great struggles between the old and the new, some dull-witted people are groping for a way out, while at the same time, in the process of advancing on that way out, they seem to have discovered the shadow of impending destruction. Their courage for life cannot withstand the fear of destruction. However, we are ultimately living beings, which means we must deal with our lives. In other words, in this contradictory environment, our senses are slow, stagnant, superficial, empty, and drifting. The only thing that comforts us is intense, unrealistic stimulation. Just as mythological stories like "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" and "Investiture of the Gods" in old dramas have become a source of comfort for the lower classes in this era, so too have plays like "Thunderstorm" become a source of comfort for the general petty bourgeoisie—especially those who are intellectually "liberated"—and the intellectual class in this era, which is not surprising.</p>
<p>However, another reason why "Thunderstorm" is popular is because of the playwright's skillful technique of hiding old content in a new guise, using the kind of stimulation that the general audience needs to entice their emotions.</p>
<p>Although "Thunderstorm" is a four-act play that takes more than four hours to perform, with over a dozen actors and dozens of scenes, the content is actually very simple and ordinary. Furthermore, because the theme that the author wants to promote seems to be approached with an evasive attitude, and this evasive attitude is also twofold, the result is a confusion of the theme. However, this confusion is the author's clever technique, but the effect it has on the audience is probably unexpected by the author, and at the same time, it is something that the author did not intend to anticipate. The material the author has adopted is indeed a novel and shocking story, but the author has not developed it, and has deliberately suppressed its development, simply turning it into a rigid, static story. Therefore, no matter how much the audience cries or laughs at those intensely stimulating scenes, it is just a superficial stimulation. They do not understand the theme at all, because they cannot grasp it in the first place. However, the reason why the China Traveling Theatre Company's performance of "Thunderstorm" was so successful was precisely because of the effect of those intense, stimulating scenes that made the audience cry and laugh. From the standpoint of box office success, the author's script is suitable for professional theatre companies.</p>
<p>The plot is as follows: There is a mine owner named Zhou Puyuan, who studied in Germany. In his youth, he fell in love with a maid named Shiping (according to the plot, it would be more appropriate to call it "illicit affair"). However, after she gave birth to their second son, because the Zhou family arranged for Zhou Puyuan to marry another woman, they drove her out (this is all said by Lu Shiping, and is not shown in the play). Shiping, carrying a newborn baby who was only three days old and sick, was banished and went to drown herself in the river. This was probably "Heaven's will," right? By chance, she encountered a "philanthropist" who rescued both her and the baby. This was probably also "divine blessing," right? The mother and child not only did not die, but also did not suffer any illness. Later, Shiping married two more times. Her last husband was named Lu Gui, and their child grew up to be Lu Dahai. During these twenty years of twists and turns, Zhou Fanyi, the wife of Zhou Puyuan after the first wife, and Zhou Ping, the son of Zhou Puyuan by his first wife Shiping, actually fell in love (it would be better to call this an "illicit affair"). It's truly "no coincidence, no story." At this time, Lu Gui became a servant in the Zhou family. Lu Gui recommended his daughter Sifeng, whom he had with Shiping, to work as a maid in the Zhou family. The eldest young master, Zhou Ping, seeing Sifeng's youth, fell in love with her and had a physical relationship, resulting in a three-month pregnancy. Since Zhou Ping had Sifeng, he naturally became cold towards Fanyi, and Fanyi's jealousy of Sifeng was inevitable. When Sifeng's mother returned from elsewhere, Fanyi invited her to talk, intending to ask her to take away the eyesore, Sifeng. It was very coincidental that Lu Dahai was working in Zhou Puyuan's mine and was elected as a representative due to a strike issue. He came to the Zhou family to negotiate with Zhou Puyuan. At the same time, Shiping came to the Zhou family and encountered Zhou Puyuan. Thus, the truth came to light. Zhou Puyuan then dismissed Lu Gui and Sifeng. However, Zhou Ping's passion for Sifeng did not die. That night, he braved the wind and rain to meet Sifeng at the Lu's house, only to be caught by Lu Dahai. Zhou Ping and Sifeng fled back to the Zhou's house, and Shiping and Dahai also rushed over. At this time, although Shiping knew the blood relationship between Zhou Ping and Sifeng, she still endured the pain in her heart and allowed them to escape together. Just then, Fanyi arrived, wanting to reveal her relationship with Zhou Ping to stop them. In this chaotic scene, Zhou Puyuan was also alarmed. He told Zhou Ping in front of everyone that Lu Shiping was his biological mother, and Sifeng immediately rushed out the door, touching a lightning-struck power line and dying. Zhou Ping committed suicide with a gun, and Fanyi and Shiping were both shocked into madness. In this way, this abusive story ended with the phrase "retribution is clear."</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>At first glance, the author's audacity is indeed frightening. However, because of the author's skill, this frightening story is gradually transformed into a mysterious story that conforms to "human emotions" and also conforms to "heavenly principles," "morality," and "conscience."</p>
<p>The characters that appear in this play not only include a "rebellious son" who has an affair with his stepmother, but also a jealous woman who resists her husband's oppression, and even a representative of striking workers, Zhou Chong, who speaks eloquently about equality and wants to eliminate class concepts, as well as Sifeng, who deceives her mother. The author uses "peaceful means" to deal with all these rebellious and dangerous elements.</p>
<p>Sifeng once swore an oath, denying that she had any "entanglements" with the young masters of the Zhou family. In the midst of thunder rumbling outdoors, she knelt before her mother and said, "If I deceive you, may I be struck by lightning!" It can be seen that "heavenly principles" are fixed. Ah! Although at that time, perhaps the Zhou family's house had "lightning rod" equipment? Using "lightning strike" is anti-scientific, but the author had already laid the groundwork, preemptively eliciting from Fanyi's mouth the dialogue that the electric pole had fallen. Therefore, Sifeng's death by hugging the electric wire not only "swore an oath," but also did not violate science at the same time. Similarly, Zhou Ping, this "rebellious son," should have suffered "divine punishment" with a "lightning strike," but in the end, he committed suicide with a gun: this is also very reasonable, because the gun was originally one of the "five thunders"!</p>
<p>Lu Dahai is a worker who dares to negotiate with Zhou Puyuan with a mouth full of "equality," and is even very violent. However, because the author wants to use his own abandoned son to stir up trouble, to show "retribution," Dahai is also perfunctorily deceived by Puyuan on the matter of the workers. Dahai knows that he is a poor man, and his sister should not marry the rich man Zhou Ping, and even uses knives and guns to oppose it. However, in the end, for the sake of his sister's "chastity" and the morality of "a woman not marrying twice," he also perfunctorily agrees, and even, contrary to his previous feelings, urges his mother to agree. The author's intention is to say that poverty and wealth are not irreconcilable, and that workers also have "morality."</p>
<p>Zhou Chong (Puyuan's second son) has some discrimination against old morals, so he also dies by electric shock with Sifeng, in order to avoid later danger. As for Fanyi, the "jealous woman" and "licentious woman," she is of course despised by our society, and dying of pestilence is her deserved "retribution."</p>
<p>The author's technique is exquisite!</p>
<p>Old wine in a new bottle. Although the bottle is beautiful and stylish, the taste of the wine is still the taste of old wine!</p>
<h3>The Invaded World Giant</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiayou</p>
<p>The world giant mentioned here is not some prodigy who is making a big splash internationally, but a giant species that lives in a corner of today's "civilized world." This should be clarified first.</p>
<p>According to Magellan, who was the first to travel the world, when he and his companions were sailing through the Strait of Magellan a few days before, one day they landed on the near-eastern coast of the southern tip of South America and discovered huge human footprints on the sand. But at that time, they felt very terrified and did not dare to go out, so in the end they did not see the posture of that giant native, but simply called him Bigfoot. Later, due to European exploration, it was learned that this Bigfoot was even more of a world giant species. The height of this giant species is said to be seven feet! Europeans call them the Patagonians, and they call themselves the Tsoneca, which in their language means "human beings."</p>
<p>This famous world giant species originally lived in the Voslaplata Plain of South America. After the sixteenth century, due to the oppression of the invading Latin nations, they gradually moved south, and the grassland Pampa between the Andes Mountains south of 36 degrees south latitude and the Atlantic Ocean became their residence, which is where they live now. Speaking of their appearance, it is also slightly different from other human races: their heads are longer, their faces are very large, their eyebrows and beards are very sparse, they have dark eyes and black hair, and they are half-naked, which looks a bit scary. Regarding their origin, there is still no clear answer. Some say that from the perspective of ancient South American culture and even race, their origin is generally related to the Pacific Islands, but in any case, the origin of this giant species still needs to be further studied by scholars.</p>
<p>The life of the giant species is mainly based on hunting. Now they have horses, and they mostly use horsepower for hunting and walking. Horses can be said to be their most important living tool. But before 156 years ago, there were no horses in this place. At that time, they had to rely on their strong and sturdy feet to walk on the grasslands and chase wild animals. Their number was originally very large, but because of the persecution of "civilized" white people, because of the invasion of harsh climates and customs, there are probably only tens of thousands of them now.</p>
<p>Because life is still primitive, the giants do not know anything about God Jesus, nor do they know about Sakyamuni, that is to say, they do not have modern popular religious beliefs. What they believe in are spirits, both good and evil spirits. According to them, the good spirit is the spirit of the ancients. Now it lives in the caves in the mountains and is constantly blessing them. At the same time, this spirit also continuously breeds the sheep, camels, and ostriches necessary for their life, and enables them to capture these things. As for another evil spirit, it comes out when the good spirit is asleep, causing those ominous animals, foxes and wolves, to be active and harm them.</p>
<p>They are very afraid of that evil spirit. Every day, before the sun comes out, the warriors of the tribe have to light torches and chase the devil out from behind their tents. Sometimes the warriors also have to ride on horseback, waving torches and shouting loudly, chasing the evil spirit to a distant place.</p>
<p>The Patagonia region is blown by very strong westerly winds, so the giants specially build tents facing east. There is a thin path in the center of this area, which is used for tribal work contact. Now, they already have some cattle and sheep, but this is a recent thing. Before, they did not have horses and other domestic animals, and they were still purely a hunting nation. What they can do mainly is animal skin curtains and shawls. They have no banknotes or foreign money, and they have no modern trade knowledge. Instead, they engage in barter trade. The ostrich feathers that are unique to this place are the items most liked by white people. Many Europeans and Americans bring "cultural goods" to exchange with the giants. This may be said to be their "international trade."</p>
<p>The weapon used by the giants when hunting is their unique and ingenious flying stone. On the day of the hunt, the hereditary president designates forty people to participate. The people who participate in these activities have to prepare their saddles and perfect all the preparations the night before, and gather at the designated place at a certain time, just like an army going on an expedition. The most interesting thing is that when they set out to hunt, they must bring food and prepare a pinch of salt to put in their waists. According to their custom, they should not eat anything in the morning when they set out to hunt. They must eat something when they get wild animals. If it is at night, they raise smoke and fire to notify everything. That situation makes us actually understand the situation of primitive communication and understand how communication originated.</p>
<p>The Patagonia region is one of the most terrible places in the world, and the giants living here of course have no pleasure to speak of. But one thing that they think is happiness is that there are many wild animals and birds here, and their food and clothing are not a problem. At the same time, although they themselves do not enjoy the happiness of "civilization," they are very at peace with real life, and their temperament is innocent and naive. In fact, there is nothing barbaric. In the past, there were often legends that white people came here and were harmed by them, but that was caused by the persecution of the white people, and it was not that they harmed others for no reason. Now, because the number of foreigners coming here has increased, and due to the proof of many facts, the giants are in fact inherently loving to ordinary human beings. For example, when white people come here, they need their help in many places, and they are also very happy to help others without asking for any reward. This is what civilized people cannot do. However, if you do not respect yourself, recognize them as barbarians, and bully and persecute them, then their huge fists will also be rude to you.</p>
<p>The kind giants live a quiet and peaceful life like a painting. They are not dominated or oppressed by any power, and they live equally and freely with each other. The only thing that casts a shadow on their lives is the "civilized people" who come here to do business. Those "civilized people" often transport inferior beer to this place and sell it indiscriminately, sometimes even deceiving the giants out of their beautiful fur shawls and beautiful horses with one or two cups of beer, causing problems with their own clothing. If everything of the giants represents the primitive people, and everything of the "civilized people" who come here to do business represents the modern, then we have to ask the readers: Has humanity evolved? Or is it degenerating?</p>
<h3>Contending for Legitimacy</h3>
<p>— Ding Fengbai</p>
<p>In the era of monarchical autocracy, as soon as the monarch died, a new monarch had to be established immediately to inherit the great treasure, because "the world cannot be without a monarch for a day." This is called inheriting the orthodox lineage.</p>
<p>Continued on page five.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>A new decree should only be one, because "there are not two suns in a day, and the people have no two kings." This is called legitimacy. However, when the world is in turmoil and chaos, with "three dukes in one country," where you point to me as a fake, and I point to you as a rebel, which one is legitimate? Therefore, later historians have to determine who is legitimate and who is false. The standard for distinguishing between legitimacy and falsehood is to see how much territory they have, how long they have been in power, whether they belong to the bloodline of the previous dynasty, whether they occupy the old capital, and whether they are descendants of the Han nationality. However, despite the comments of later historians, who determine legitimacy and falsehood after the fact, it is very difficult to distinguish between legitimacy and falsehood at that time, and the common people under their "rule" can only recognize the ruler as legitimate and dare not distinguish.</p>
<p>From emperors vying for the legitimacy of the throne, it has also reached the academic and cultural circles vying for the legitimacy of the tradition. This is also "already nurtured in ancient times." Not to mention the distant past, just take the Tongcheng School and the Yanghu School of the Qing Dynasty as examples. They each inherited the mantle and had their own traditions, where you said I was fake and I said you were a rebel. Even today, there are still slogans of "learning has a teacher's transmission, following a certain family" and "either inheriting ancient texts or continuing modern texts." In addition, since ancient times, "writers have despised each other," so the contention for legitimacy is even more fierce than the contention for the throne. Many of them, like the contention for the legitimacy of the throne, are not necessarily contending for the legitimacy of someone or a certain school's scholarship and articles, but are mostly boasting of the close relationship between themselves and the person they follow, and thus claiming to be the legitimate successor of someone or a certain school. For example, Dai Cunzhuang, who considered himself a direct descendant of the Tongcheng School, once said, "I was born in the hometown of Wangxi Haifeng, and I dare not not take ancient texts as my responsibility." Because of the hometown relationship, one can inherit the legitimate lineage. Others, such as those who claim to be legitimate because of father-son relationships, uncle-nephew relationships, or father-in-law-son-in-law relationships, are even too numerous to mention. Thus, the legitimacy of scholarship and articles has also become the legitimacy of the succession to the throne.</p>
<p>There is no need for us to praise Mr. Lu Xun's scholarship and articles again. Naturally, we also hope that young people will learn his spirit and his articles and carry them on. However, as Mr. Lu Xun satirized during his lifetime, he definitely did not want people to treat him as a "tradition" to contend for, and he himself did not think that he had a "tradition." However, after his death, there were quite a few people contending for the tradition and contending for legitimacy.</p>
<p>Ms. Xu Guangping and Mrs. Lu Xun Zhaoping are contending for the legitimacy of Mr. Lu Xun, which is for royalties. A certain boss and a certain bookstore are each recommending one or two writers to contend for compiling the complete works of Lu Xun, which is for business. But what is the purpose of some young writers vying to carry the coffin, act as masters of ceremonies, and act as the general commander at the funeral? Moreover, from the texts of Xu Guangping and Kanzo Uchiyama commemorating Lu Xun, it seems that we have not seen a young writer serving the dying Lu Xun every morning and evening. From the young writers' own commemorative texts, we have only seen that they all went to see Lu Xun after he had passed away. So why, as soon as Lu Xun died, did they vie to snatch him over and hug him in their arms, pretending that "I have never shed tears like this when my father died," and when speaking to others, they also pretended to be sobbing and unable to speak? Since they were so sad, then what strength and spirit did they have to contend for the general commander, and even to the point of almost resorting to violence? How is this different from the princes and grandsons not burying the emperor, who had been dead for a long time and whose corpses had maggots crawling out, because they were vying for the throne? Does it mean that by contending like this, if you win and become the general commander, then Mr. Lu Xun's great treasure will be seized by you alone, and you can "coerce the emperor to command the princes," to command all the writers, to restore the flag of the "old literary general," and to ascend to the extreme of the "literary leader"?</p>
<p>Moreover, they are able to visit Mr. Lu, be close to Mr.'s morals, talk to Mr., and also be able to personally carry Mr.'s coffin, be the general commander, and even compile Mr. Lu's complete works. What a great honor! Truly "the luckiest few young people among the 400 million people in the Republic of China"! Even more fortunate than receiving Jesus' personal anointing and baptism!</p>
<p>But what does this have to do with inheriting Mr. Lu Xun's spirit and learning? Wasn't it clearly written in Lu Xun's will that "everyone takes care of their own lives"? Where does it tell you to contend for legitimacy?</p>
<p>Now let me quote a few words from Mr. Lu Xun to conclude:</p>
<p>"The misfortune of writers is not in being attacked and neglected during their lifetime. After death, their words and deeds disappear, and then unscrupulous people falsely claim to be confidants, and right and wrong arise like bees. They use this not only to defend themselves, but also to make money. Even the dead bodies have become their tools for selling fame and power, which is worth mourning." (Remembering Mr. Wei Suyuan)</p>
<h3>Problems of Resistance and Preparation for War</h3>
<p>— Lu Jingzhi</p>
<p>It is imperative to resist aggression, China needs to resist now, and it is even becoming an era; in other words, China is entering an era of resistance—all this is truth, and no one denies it except traitors. Therefore, resistance is a universal proposition.</p>
<p>But if we further ask: is the timing for resistance better now or in the future? Should the resistance be carried out in a partial or national manner? … Everyone’s answer will be different. The most intense debate revolves around two propositions: resistance with preparation and resistance without preparation.</p>
<p>According to the argument for resistance with preparation, China's weapons are inferior to those of the enemy, and if we fight now, we will inevitably fail. Therefore, we must do preparatory work to accumulate sufficient strength before victory can be assured. Those who oppose this view call it "the theory of relying solely on weapons," and consider it the thinking of traitors. According to them, China should resist immediately, without preparation, which can be called the theory of resistance without preparation.</p>
<p>Regarding these two views, I believe the latter is more flawed. It is clearly an emotional theory of resistance, a blindly impulsive theory of resistance, and an unplanned theory of resistance. It confuses the theory of relying solely on weapons with traitorous thinking, and loses sight of reason in favor of emotion. Therefore, most of those who support it are young petty bourgeois. This is not because its truthfulness is sufficient, but because it is fundamentally petty bourgeois consciousness, which suits the tastes of young people.</p>
<p>Just think: resistance is a major event related to the survival of the nation. How can we not consider it? How can we not prepare for it? How can we not have a comprehensive plan? Reason is absolutely necessary here. From a factual point of view, China lags behind its enemies in everything. Taking weapons alone, if Engels's saying "pistols triumph over broadswords" is true, then isn't it obvious that China should prepare weapons?</p>
<p>Resistance requires weapons. Without weapons, how can we resist? To advocate resisting airplanes and artillery with bare hands is to dream of confronting sharp instruments with mere courage, which is idealistic in philosophy and not correct. To oppose Engels is obvious. This is bound to fail in reality and has no possibility of defeating the enemy. If the goal of resistance is to subdue the enemy and achieve victory, then we should not oppose preparation, but should advocate preparation.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that a true resister should have the following attitude towards weapons: the newer the guns and cannons, the better; the more airplanes, the better; the stronger the fortresses, the better; the more well-trained soldiers, the better; the more bullets stockpiled, the better… Combat certainly requires courage, but it also requires weapons. Only by uniting courage and weapons can we kill the enemy and achieve victory.</p>
<p>Therefore, our criticism of "the theory of relying solely on weapons" should not be based on opposing weapons or belittling weapons, but should point out its narrowness. That is to say, it only knows about the preparation of weapons, and does not know about other preparations besides weapons, such as economic, political, educational, cultural, diplomatic, etc. It does not know that modern warfare is not a simple military problem, but a competition of the entire national strength. Here, we should advocate large-scale preparation. True resistance requires full preparation for war. Therefore, resistance and preparation for war are not in conflict.</p>
<p>Therefore, separating and opposing resistance and preparation for war, and advocating resistance apart from preparation, is childish resistance. Otherwise, it is either using leftist empty talk to deceive people, or entrusting China's destiny to a desperate gamble. Such a theory of resistance is irresponsible and can only be believed by simple-minded people, inexperienced people, and those who use resistance to seek political gain. The correct theory of resistance is unified with the theory of preparation for war.</p>
<p>Simple-minded advocates of resistance say: if you prepare, won't the enemy also prepare? Moreover, their production is developed, and their tax revenue is high, so they are better prepared than you, so you will never be as good as them, what is the use of preparing? This is very reasonable and should serve as a warning to those who dream of turning the comparison of our broadswords to the enemy's pistols into a comparison of cannons to pistols.</p>
<p>But my theory of preparation for war is different. We should only prepare as many weapons as possible, and not necessarily turn the comparison of broadswords to pistols into a comparison of cannons to pistols. Judging from the economic capabilities of us and the enemy, it is enough to achieve a ratio of fewer pistols to more pistols. Because the decision of victory or defeat does not depend entirely on weapons. With sufficient weapons, plus other conditions superior to the enemy, victory can be assured. Therefore, the idea of preparing weapons should only be to shorten the distance that is too far apart.</p>
<p>At the same time, I believe that preparation for war should not abandon necessary resistance. That is to say, if resistance is necessary before the preparation for war has reached our minimum limit, we should resist immediately. Resistance without a guarantee of victory can of course be avoided. If it cannot be avoided and resistance is unavoidable, then we should resist immediately. Therefore, preparation for war is not preparing for war outside of resistance, but is unified with resistance. Prepare for war when resistance is not necessary; resist when resistance is necessary.</p>
<p>The theory of simple preparation for war also has its errors. It divides resistance and preparation for war too clearly, believing that we prepare for war at a certain time and resist at a certain time. In the period of preparation for war, we can only prepare for war, and we can only resist in the period of resistance. But it does not know that the enemy's invasion does not follow our plans. If the enemy invades during the period of preparation for war, and we merely prepare for war, without asking whether we should resist, and generally respond with insufficient preparation, then we have clearly committed an irreparable mistake, which will cause future problems. Therefore, the theory of simply preparing for war is incorrect.</p>
<p>Therefore, some proponents of resistance—those with simple views, regard preparation for war as not fighting, which also has a reason. But they are not correct in viewing the simple theory of preparation for war as a theory of not fighting. Their reason is that the citizens do not resist, and the rulers do not resist. In fact, they do not know at all that resistance is to protect property and defend political power. Therefore, all those who have property and all those who have political power must resist. Didn't the Manchu nobles resist for decades? Are the wars between China and England, China and France, the Anglo-French Allied Forces, China and Japan, and the Eight-Nation Alliance still fake? Even if you, Jianzhi, cannot remember these histories, then haven't you forgotten that A-Huang's resistance also won your sympathy? Any property owner or power holder will not surrender until the end of the resistance. Therefore, the saying that citizens do not resist and rulers do not resist is not reasonable. Those who prepare for war are those who resist. Their mistake lies not in not fighting, but in simply preparing for war, that is, metaphysically separating preparation for war from resistance.</p>
<p>Of course, saying that the rulers do not resist is not only based on regarding preparation for war as not fighting, but also has other facts as a basis. This is the well-known compromise. There have been many such compromises in recent years, and I believe no one is satisfied with them. But I don't think we can conclude from this that the rulers do not resist. All rulers have the nature of defending their political power and will never surrender until the end of the resistance. China has not yet had formal resistance, let alone the end, so how can we say that they will not resist? The compromise, I believe, is due to strategy—their overall plan. Everyone understands that advocating resistance is only a general guideline; but this guideline is not straight but curved, so it is not impossible to compromise. If the timing of resistance is not conducive, or a certain preparation is not timely, and there is a need for delay, then it can be done through compromise. If political analysts regard temporary compromise as permanent compromise, then they have committed the error of neglecting the essence with phenomena, which is not correct.</p>
<p>Here, we must know that a theorist of resistance should not be a warmonger. That is to say, he does not ask whether resistance is necessary, whether resistance can be temporarily avoided for the sake of full preparation, and only resists blindly, and resists at every turn. Such a theory of resistance is bound to be mechanistic, and there is bound to be a loss of indiscriminate resistance. On the other hand, we must also know that the compromise under the general line of resistance is not a vain compromise, a blind compromise, or an unlimited compromise. It is done for a purpose, is compromised only when necessary, and has a certain limit. In short, neither resistance nor compromise are for conditions, but each has its suitability. Truth is concrete, not abstract. This is a concept that should be noted.</p>
