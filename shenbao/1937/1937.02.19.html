<h3>巴利亞列克羣島的形勢</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤譯</p>
<p>Foreign　Affairs</p>
<p>巴利亞列克羣島、幾世紀來，在地中海的戰略上，一直佔着重要的地位，而最近因意大利征服阿比西尼亞與西班牙發生內亂，地中海的均勢發生了變動，這又成為舉世矚目的地方了。</p>
<p>巴島（巴利亞列克羣島的簡稱下同—譯者）在經濟上是亳無重要性的，面積不過二·○○○方哩，人口也祇有三五○·○○○人，而且沒有任何珍貴的礦產蔬果之類雖然尚稱豐盛，為英德所歡迎，但决不值得為此而用戰爭的方式來奪取巴島，可是在國際上却有其重要性，因為巴島的軍港都散佈在法國與其北菲，英帝國由直布羅陀經過馬爾他蘇夷士至印度的海洋路綫上。</p>
<p>巴島的極東有明諾加（Minorca）在十八世紀的時候始為英國所佔領，英國所以要奪取明諾加，完全是由於戰略上的關係·而明諾加主要的城市是馬翁港（Port　Mahon），一堅不可拔易守難攻的良港；英國在一八○三年的失去該港，就英國的本身言，並不算是一大損失，因為英國在一七九九年已佔領了　更好的港口罵爾他，開闢為英國在東地中海的根據地。除了明諾加會一度英國所有而外，巴鳥自從中世紀把摩爾人（Moors）逐出後，最初屬於阿拉貢（Aragon）是的統治，後來始成為西班牙的一部分。當分離運動的領袖在巴塞龍那（Barcelon)活動的時候，曾　圖聯合巴島，成立一﹁大加泰倫尼亞﹂（Crdater　Catalonia）巴島的人氏雖然大半都操着加泰倫尼亞的語言，但是當西班牙共和政府允許加泰倫尼亞成立為自治政府時，並未把巴島劃歸加泰倫尼亞。</p>
<p>巴島旣橫亘在法國與其北非屬地交通路綫的中央，法國政府所以極力與西班牙政府保持着好友的關係，其主要的原因也就在此。由於同樣的原因，英國為了要保護到印度去的通路的安全，始終反對西班牙把巴島讓與第三國。一般人士也一致相信，當前次世界大戰爆發時，倫敦曾與馬德里訂立一協定，因此英國的海軍便可借用馬翁港為其海軍根據地，如果意大利參加在中歐集團作戰的話，幾年前巴黎也會經一度為非正式的消息驚惶過，謂西班牙的利佛拉（Primo　de　Rivera)已允許墨案里尼，在某種緊急的塲合，得借用巴島為其根據地；只是自一九三一年西班牙共和政府成立後，此項協定便無疾而終了。西班牙政府當局鑒於巴島在戰略上的重要性，近年來也非常努力以增强其防潔工程。一九三五年軍政部長羅勃爾斯（Gil　Robbes），就是今日西班牙叛軍領袖之一，在巴島的工作，也不能説不努力。</p>
<p>法西斯蒂意大利的突然勃興，成為世界海軍強國之一，完全依靠其在巴鳥的特殊權利。英國已受盡了墨案里尼的侮辱，他肆無忌憚的出征東菲，而且在事實上英國也不再視到印度去的路綫為安全了。同樣如果意大利眞的已取得以該島為海空軍根據地的權利，法國要自由地從其北菲殖民地取得谷倉與人力的供給，也已成為冒險的行為了。</p>
<p>就是在目前的情勢之下，西地中海幾將完全操縱在意大利以斯不齊亞（La　Spezia）壁倫那（La　Maddaena）為根據的空軍的手裏了。如果意大利夕在巴島取得根據地，則法國不得以迂曲的大西洋路綫為其南北菲屬地的交通路綫了。所以西班牙一旦成立法西斯政府，就是不論意大利是否非法佔領巴島，將來意法發生戰事，只要法西斯的西班牙允許法西斯蒂意大利借用馬翁港，巴爾馬（Palma）以及其島嶼，則在法國為最危險不過的事情。換言之，意大利志愿兵（Italian　Volonteers）的，開往西班牙，據艾登於十一月三十日在下院的報告，似已非正式的佔領巴島。雖為非正式，然其作用則一。</p>
<p>西班牙叛軍政府的負責領袖，也會一再否認，他們已允許將巴島讓與意大利或其他國家的謠傳。從西班牙人愛好民族光榮—未為拿破崙所擊破—的觀點看過去，是否會有一種政體，居然會不顧　切的把民族的遺業讓與他人，却是一個疑問。所以至多僅能允許列強在戰時認購必要時　享有陸軍海軍空軍的特權而已。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國防白皮書的意義及其影響</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>在戰雲籠罩着全世界。列强瘋狂似的競擴着軍備的今日。英國內閣發表了白皮書。要在五年以內。完成驚人的國防計劃。這當然並不是出於偶然的。英國自一九三一年工黨內閣下臺。保守黨重執政權以後。就捲入了軍備競爭的漩渦前年意國侵阿戰爭爆發。英國保守黨內閣更感到大擴軍備的必要。於去年三月宣怖了擴軍計劃。可是這個計劃實佈未久。德國又廢棄洛迦諸公約進兵萊茵區域延長兵役年限。而美日兩國則於倫敦華府兩海約期𣺏以後。也在太平洋加緊設防。在這種情勢之下。英國當加非再把擴軍計劃强化不可。這次國防計劃白皮書的發表。就向世界昭示着。在國際軍備競賽中。英國决不願稍稍落後的。</p>
<p>這次擴軍的目的。據保守黨議員口口聲聲説。是在繼持世界和平。而白皮書中則説。“英國之領域。四散分佈極遠。本國所需求於海外之供給。必須由海道轉運而來。凡此種種。均有重視英國軍方之必要。海軍必須維持交通之安全。責任尤屬重大。而英帝國各屬地軍事重要地點防御之近代化。亦為國防計劃最重要之一項。”這更表示着。英國對於散佈在全民界的殖民地的利益。抱着確保的决心。可是誰都知道。軍備競爭很容易引起戰爭。英國能否阻止這一種可盧的趨勢。實在是很大的疑問。</p>
<p>據白皮書所載。在五年以內英國擴軍費用。約須支出十五萬鎊。這鉅額支出的負擔者。無疑的是英國廣大的納稅者羣。所以這個計劃在下院討論的時候。工黨議員極力反對。認為徒增人民負擔。不合時宜。照目前情勢看來。這個計劃在下院中。雖式可因保守黨議員的支持而獲得通過。但要擭得大多數民衆眞誠的擁護。恐怕很難罷。</p>
<p>不但如此。擴軍是有傳染性的。甲國的擴軍會引起乙國的擴軍。乙國的擴軍又會引起丙國的擴軍。而乙丙等國的撤軍。又會引起甲國的再度撤軍。這次英國的撤軍在某種意義上。可説是其他各國撤軍的結果。但這又會引起其他各國進一步的撤軍來。現在英國防計劃白皮書剛才發表。德國就提出了同樣權利的要求。日本海軍也準備急起直追。意大利則傳將於三月一日舉行的最高法西斯會議中提出大規模的國防計劃了。這樣。列强軍備互為因果地擴張下去。當然世界上最慘酷的災禍是要到來的。</p>
<h3>英國擴充海軍美國不甘落後</h3>
<p>惟以為英美勢力不衝突希望英增加太平洋實力</p>
<p>［華盛頓］海軍參謀長黎希上將、得悉英國擬於四月一日、動工建造戰艦三艘、航空母艦二艘、及巡艦若干艘消息後、今日向新聞記者稱、倘他國提高海軍實力、至原有條約之限額以上、則美國或將繼起、惟彼亦鄭重聲明、並無資格可以代表國務部或海軍部發表劉於英國計劃之意見；彼僅知美國政策、為决不使美國之海軍、次於任何國家而巳、同時其他海軍長官亦大概相信、强有力之英國海軍、為一種安定勢力、尤以太平洋方面為甚、有人且以為美國歡迎英國在太平洋中增加軍力、黎希上將亦稱、美國與英國維持均等之實力、僅為政策問題、不可視為英美兩國有何衝突之兆云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］英國政府昨日公佈國防程序白皮書、其中列有海軍造艦計畫、頃悉美國政府不擬另訂海軍造船計畫、以與英國相競爭、蓋一則政府方面以為一九三七年度美國海軍預算案、其中所列經費已敷革新海軍之用、二則造艦所需之鋼、亦頗感缺乏云、（十七哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英海相説明各國造艦</h3>
<p>蘇俄參加　潛艇公約</p>
<p>［倫敦］海相霍爾、今日在下院答復問話、謂列强已造成及在建造中之裝八吋口徑砲位之巡洋艦、共數如下、英國十五艘、美國十八艘、日本十二艘、法意各七艘、德國三艘、霍爾又稱、近報載英國此類巡洋艦業已失其優越地位之説、渠欲乘今日之機會、聲明其不足信云、（中央社十七日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英法美三國前於去年三日二十五日所簽訂之海軍條約、附有關於潛水艇戰爭人道化之議定書一件、此項議定書、業由英法美意德日等國於去年十一月六日舉行簽字、蘇俄駐英大使邁斯基、頃以照會一件、送達英國外務次官汪西泰爵士、內稱、蘇俄政府對於此項議定書、亦願簽字加入云、按關於潛水艇戰爭人道化之議定書、其絛文與華盛頓海軍條約所載相同、略謂、戰時潛水艇對於任何商船、必須先將其全體船員及旅客、置於安全地帶之後、始可加以擊沉或損壞云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美中立案</h3>
<p>參陳之修正文</p>
<p>［華盛頓］參院外交委員會考盧其主席畢特門所提出之永久中立議案、兹已藏事、略予修正、案中規定、㊀禁止以借欵或軍火供給國際戰爭、或內國戰爭之交戰團體、㊁其他物品、非至所有權已由美人移諸外國購者後、不能輸出、㊂美國商船不得加以武裝、美國公民、不得乘交戰國之船隻旅行、一切條欵、均於總統宣布戰爭壯況存在時卽自然發生效力、授權總統得隨意禁止美船運載足以危及美國和平之任何物品、（中央社十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>英擴充軍備保障世界和平</h3>
<p>財相向議會説明宗旨工黨自由黨紛紛責難</p>
<p>［倫敦］財相張怕倫昨在議會對於政府所提出四萬萬鎊國防公債案、發表强有力之辯護、以答復工黨及自由黨之責難、張怕倫宣稱、此項債欵之用途、係屬維持和平、英帝國對於和平之努力、及決不肯用武力以資侵略、係任何人所能了解者、且英國之努力維持和平、不僅為本國、且亦為世界各國、英政府據已往經騐、深知英國之勢力與英國之軍力、其盈虧實息息相關、故今日英國之軍力、旣在與日俱進之中、卽屬穩定國際政局之因素、亦卽世界和平之中流砥柱云、</p>
<p>議會辯論、自張伯倫提出國防公債案後、今日卽將結束、對於政府欲於五年中動用國防費用十五萬萬鎊之計劃、首發非雞之聲者、卽前上黨內閣中曾任財部秘書之勞倫斯、勞氏抨擊白皮書之要點、認為政府國防計劇與其外交政策、尤其與集體安全理想有關之外交政策之間、並無考慮成熟之聯繫、再則白皮書所提出之國防計劃、並無眞實調節辦法之表現、且對於保證有効之國防辦法、於重要軍事之考慮上、亦無概念乏形式可尋、勞氏宣稱、工黨之所以反對此决議案、因其不以適常賦稅之途徑、以此鉅大之負擔加諸全民之身、而欲以舉債辦法、因膨脹之關係加諸物價、使力薄最不能負擔云云、</p>
<p>自由黨議員辛克萊爵士繼起發言、辛克萊稱、自由黨對於概算書、正在嚴密查察之中、惟對於國防及和平所必需之軍備、將加以贊成、彼稱歐洲某某等國家之整軍經武、雖道德上之責任、依彼個人之見解、應由歐戰後戰勝國家之戰後政策承擔之、但英國確有實逼處此、他無途徑可循之感、惟辛氏對於舉債計劃、認為在現在商業昭蘇之情形下、為經濟上之不智、且對於非法謀利之徒、能否防止、亦屬疑問云、</p>
<p>工黨議員阿特里於張伯倫提出國防公債議案時、稱為和平時期中空前未有之舉措、張氏則謂此實由於目前之時代、已入空能末有之情狀中、使英國不得不於短促之時期中、支出巨額中軍費、再則今日軍備之代價、較諸歐戰之後已見暴漲、蓋無論何國均已感覺和平前途之不可恃、而傾其全力於攻擊之增加、因而新器械新運輸物及新設備之發明、遂日新月異、但矛愈利盾亦愈堅、攻擊與防守之用具、實無以定費用之高下、但英國因其責任之重大、要害之衆多、故對於攻守兩方之籌備均不可忽視、無論在國內在一切交通綫上、均應用最新式之設備、以抵拒他人之襲擊、並須置備强大之軍力、隨時可派遺至任何地點、張伯倫稱、星期二日所公布之白皮書、對於國防費用之用途及用法已詳細列具、至用途之細則、此後可於海陸空三軍之概算書中得之、再則白皮書中所載五年之中、國防費用之總敷將達十五萬萬鎊、但此並非確切不移之數、如形勢變更、使費用後少節省、政府固將竭力得以减縮、但自各國軍備開始擴張以來、國際間形勢對英實為不利、倘此後斷續如此、則現在之十五萬萬鎊、此後恐將復感覺其不足云、</p>
<p>繼工黨議員漢德森質問、英國是否將單獨自衛、抑將成為集體安全系統之一部份、張伯倫答、為公衆之利益起見、殊不能在理想上説明何者為敵、何者為友、蓋英政府之計劃、並非對任何一國成任何一集體國家而發、但政府為國家安全起見、為盡其責任起見、不得不將必需之計劃、向議會陳明之、張伯倫復指示、依據白皮書之預計、每年賦稅額外之增加為三千二百萬鎊、而舉債之數尚不在其內、但倘議會不以舉債之權授諸政府、則應由賦稅上增加之國防費用、每歲將為一萬一千二百萬鎊、依彼所見、如此龐大之賦稅負擔、恐將使方見抬頭之商業復興、重受打擊而致一蹶不振、張氏復説明納稅者、旣已對於國防費用之全額擔負其四分之三、故額外公債之增加、實不為過份云、</p>
<p>張伯倫繼對於舉債之辦法有所陳述、謂財部應有依據常時情形、以至經濟之辦法設法籌集欵項之權、至三厘息金及三十年退還辦法、不過係賬本上處理辦法、與財部發行公債之方法、並無必需之關係、財部之發行公債或發行國庫券、载發行其他方式之債券、而準備金則有無均可、張伯倫復指明阿特里認此種辦法、為戰時措施之錯誤、因此辦法根本卽為維持和平之辦法、政府因此龐大之計劃、係保障己身安全與維持他國安全所必需、故無法避免其責任、至國民因軍事費用所增加負擔、惟財長最能體念其意義、而深恨今世文明之自相殘害、不知由取與之方法以解决其爭端、而努力從事於世界人類之繁榮與滿足、但在此時際、亦只能咬緊牙關向前行去、蓋和平與政治之安定及軍縮、非一國之力所可致、但無論何地無論何時、倘英國能得一見解相同者、則英國定必與結合而共求更有效更合理智更有價值之解决方法云、</p>
<p>對於工黨之非議、張伯倫復宣稱工黨對於彼之間題、是否對於白皮書中所載國防計劃之範圍有所反對、倘未有明白之答復、張氏鄭重聲明白皮書中所載一切費用、大抵並不重複、關於自治領域方面張氏謂、英國本國無權使各自治領域担負公共費用之一部份、蓋各自治領域對於己身之防守、已費去無限之金錢、卽屬對於全體之安全、已盡其力量、至其他負担辦法、則據彼所知現在未經論及云、（中央社十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>英上院討論屬地問題</h3>
<p>［倫敦）上議院本日開會、討論德國要求收回舊日殖民地一項問題時、自由黨議員克魯勛爵曾宣稱、德國所屬殖民地在歐戰之後、卽由各國予以瓜分、此舉、在政治上實屬鑄成大錯、惟事已如此、未便加以糾正、為今之計、解决之道、當在經濟上着想、例如菲洲若干屬地、不妨樹立門戶開放制度、准許德國共霑利益、至於德國要求收回舊日殖民地所持各項論據、則不能成立、蓋曩昔德國置有廣大殖民地之時、其觖望情形、較之今日、猶有甚焉、彼時該國、所念念不忘者、厥惟聲威遠被異域、國力臻於强大而已、當由外務次官派來茅斯勛爵代表政府答復、駁斥門戶開放之説、井謂自由獲致原料品一項制度、似非德國之所蔪求云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］白克斯登勛爵、今日在上議院動議、將委託統治制度擴大、俾得施於殖民地、外交次官樸萊茅斯勳爵答稱、變動南非殖民地人民地位之任何建議、必將為彼等盛怒反對、白克斯登所主張之開放門戶政策、終不能予任何殖民屬地以充分財政自治權、此將為自治制度發展上之重大障碍、熱帶諸殖民地、無論屬於何國、苟卽實施委託統治制、及開放門戶政策、非特無益於勞工生活程度頗高之德國、或任何他國、轉將使勞工生活程度頗低各國、尤其為日本得在其地獨佔貿易上之便利、其結果將使歐洲各國喪其所有、有殖民地之列强發表共同宣言、聲明𩕮恪守國聯盟約第二十二條之規定（關於委託統治權者）雖不致因以减輕目前之緊張、但必能告成政治總解决之一部分、故英政府今不能接受白氏之動議、且信不日將在日內瓦舉行之原料委員會會議、在其討論中、必能覓得更有效之方法以解決經濟困難云、於是該問題乃作罷論、（中央社十七日路透）</p>

<h3>暹羅擴充軍備</h3>
<p>已向意日美　購軍艦飛機</p>

<h3>美駐菲島高級委員</h3>
<p>由麥納德繼任</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統今日任命前任印第安那州州長麥納德為美國派駐菲烈賓高級委員、以繼現任密歇根州州長墨飛之遺缺、麥氏謂彼當俟參院核准之後一個月內赴任、惟或者不能担任此職、至總統滿任為止、此間菲島人士對於麥氏被任委員、頗為驚奇、因彼等皆以為現任代理委員瓊斯或將眞除也、麥氏就任之後亟待應付之問題甚多、最重要者為修改菲島獨立法中關於經濟之問題、及美國將來在菲島之海軍問題、（十七日國民電）麥氏年四十五歲、初操律師業、旋任印第安那大學法律教授及印第安那大學法科教務長、並曾供職全國行政委以會一年·美國律師聯合會·美國大學教授聯合會·美國法科專校聯合會·美國和平會等會、麥氏皆為會員之一、其印第安州州長之職、於·上月任職四年期滿、（中央社十七日路透電）</p>

<h3>日軍部對政黨態度轉趨和緩</h3>
<p>陸相待機闡明立塲　庶政一新希望合作</p>
<p>［東京］杉山陸相自議會重開之第一日以來、經衆院大會之質問對於國防預算庶政一新肅軍問題及其他議會對陸軍之質疑、均已一一答辯、但政黨方面對於時局認織上、尚不無稍欠澈底之處、且對於陸軍之眞意亦略有誤會、故陸相將過去三日間質疑之內容及陸軍之見解綜合之下、原擬於十八日大會席上要求陸相見機作積極之發言、直率發表見解、但十八日竟未得到適當機會、並未發言、故此事尚須靜待異日之機緣也、（十八日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］據陸軍所觀察、廣田內閣時政黨未得認織非常時局、以致與軍部意見相隔甚遠、然前內閣辭職後、政黨對於時局認識已見變化、例如議會重開直後之政友會總裁演説及民政黨幹事長之聲明等、與軍部對時局之認識完全一致、唯政黨方面尚有策動軍民分離的性質之質問、殊為遺憾、現在政黨亦希望與軍部合作、實現庶政一新、故陸相答辯、亦似論及此點、（十八日同盟電）</p>
<h3>衆院大會質問情形</h3>
<p>［東京］十八日之衆院大會、午后一時開會、繼續前日對國務大臣演説之質問、由國同之鈴木正吾登壇、</p>
<p>謂林首相所聲明之政綱為非常抽象的、可作為維持現狀解、亦可作為革新解、此乃現內閣之本質也、然希望不為弱體內閣、而發展為强有力之內閣、次贊美首相之庶政一一致主義、再次力言對華對蘇外交之失敗、謂今日徒口倡中日親善、毫無益處、應充實者須充實之、有養成實力之必要、欲達成外交一元化、余意除打破各省各局之現狀、改內閣制為國務院制、別無方法、政府所見如何、軍部大臣承認削减地方交付金、其意見何在、增稅以加重國民之負担、對此有如何之考慮、欲謀庶政一新之具體化、應計上必需之預算、速開臨時議會、有此意志否、匡救時局之具體案如何、</p>
<p>結城蔵相答</p>
<p>中止地方財政交付金、非為抑制物價之騰貴、蓋別有所考慮、卽關於地方財政之改革、擬速考究根本方針、</p>
<p>林相答</p>
<p>政府正進行失業救濟及其他各般之社會設施、陸相外相無答辯、</p>
<p>繼由中野正剛登壇、演辭至為冗長、耗去兩小時半、兹摘其大意如左、</p>
<p>今後軍費有增無已、忍耐一時之重壓以望國家之安泰、當為國民之任務、而如何避免時局之重壓、則結城蔵相之任務也、陸軍雖謂具有消化十四億豫算之力量、但對於鐵與煤及其他軍備所必需之物、均有所不足、至為明顯、兵法謂用兵先在計畫整備器財、未知軍部有無此項豫備、</p>
<p>聞開發滿洲之五年計畫、擬費三十億圓之鉅資、應請結城藏相努力以其經騐開發滿洲之新天地、</p>
<p>林兼外相之外交、無論對華對英美均一律行使親善、向四方八面叩頭、可謂之叩頭外交、但外交與親善之感情、當屬另一問題、自應急宜打破親善外交之弊、至日德防共協定之締結與夫日蘇海業條約問題、大致可認為外交無方針云、</p>
<p>杉山陸相結城藏相相繼答辯後、林首相作答如左</p>
<p>處於今日情勢之下、不能不企圖充實國防、因此不能不期待國力之充實與夫經濟之發展、余且認為對於某種情形、希望積極採用統制方針、至視為叩頭外交、當係大誤、余最初卽不以鬥爭外交為然、其後審議政府所提之法案、由結城藏相説明提案理由、至五時三十七分散會、（十八日同盟電）</p>
<h3>衆院大會預算總會</h3>
<p>循海相要求開秘密會　聽取軍事預算案內容</p>
<p>［東京］十八日之衆院預算總會、上午十時開會、民政黨之勝正憲登壇質問、</p>
<p>結城藏相對於財政之前途、率直聲明尚無眉目、然計上此龐大之預算、而謂對於將來之財政尚無眉目、殊堪驚訝、最少亦請予以相當程度之眉目、結城藏相答</p>
<p>余曾與軍部充分商議、希望軍部諒解國民經濟力、樹立將來之財政計畫、然無時間之餘裕、故僅修正以除去前內閣預算所與之影響而止、希望以此意義審議之、</p>
<p>勝正憲仍迫結城藏相、發表財政計畫之預測、謂昭和十二年度預算中之國防計畫、對於將來之續繼費應已早具眉目、關於此點有在議會發表之意乎、結城藏相答</p>
<p>關於赤字公債、視財界之狀況如何、卽超過十億亦有能消化之時、故此點可不必憂慮、卽陸海軍預算雖已承認十二年度預算、然以後之國防費仍擬與陸海軍當局充分檢討、故今日欲預測之殊為困難、勝氏復質問軍部大臣、謂今後國防費之激增、固已無從憂慮、然國民對於國防計畫之必要程度內容、希望知悉具體的事實、</p>
<p>米內海相答</p>
<p>雖務必於公開之席上言之、然關於軍規之點甚多、請開祕密會議説明之、小山委員長起稱、請依政府之要求開秘密會、十一時開秘密會、然小山委員長對於勝氏之質問及政府方面之意見、有多少聽錯之點、故雖開秘密會、陸海軍仍無何等説明、定十九日上午十時起開預算總會秘密會、關於軍事費之內容及國防費所以至於龐大化之實狀、詳細聽取説明、零時十分散會、（十八日同盟電）</p>
<h3>召集臨時議會</h3>
<p>日政府認為尚非必要　重要國策待審愼考慮</p>
<p>［東京］林內閣成立後再度停開議會、趕念進行對付議會之準備、其結果僅得决定以預算案為中心之應急的處理方法、而未得檢討前內閣之庶政一新政策提出議會、因此庶政一新政策、尚待林內閣之檢討提交議會、林內閣關於延長義務教育案電力問題等前內閣之重要懸案、尚未决定任何具體態度、因此此等各重要法案、似不及提交本期議會、林首相結成藏相杉山陸相等政府首腦部關於此善後措置交換意見、（十八日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］政府首腦部對於召集臨時議會之問題、其見解大致如左、</p>
<p>㊀地方財政與改革稅制關係甚大、故須愼重研究、未便認為在本屆議會後卽叮迅速得到成案、㊁庶政一新之重要政策、雖因內外時局之緊迫、急宜得到成案、而拙速主義則應排斥、且現今並無緊急切迫之事態、須召集臨時議會以待解决者也、㊂議會方面要求在十一月中間召集下屆通常議會之案、故臨時議會問題之發生、當與本問題之措置相關聯、必須愼重考慮者也云云、（十一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日修正徵兵法</h3>
<p>［東京］陸海軍兵役法施行令、現已改正其一部分、業於十八日奏准、當於十九日在官報公布勅令、陸軍當局對於此事發表談話、兹摘其大要於左此次修改兵役法施行令、其中將壯丁身長之規定减低五生的、與變更現役兵之補缺制度、以上項兩件為主、歷來如不在一·五五米以上者、不能認為甲種或乙種兵、此次改正如不在一·五○米以上者、不能充甲乙兩種兵、又歷來須由一·六五米以上者中徵集現役乓與第一補充兵、現改為由一·六○米以上者徵集、倘人員不敷分配時、則對於各隊名等級一律依次减低其身長、以便充足要員之分配、歷來身體雖屬强健者、倘身長稍有不足、則不能充甲乙兩種兵、此項人員頗居相當多數、今改為大部分均合格矣、至現役兵之補缺制度、歷來凡現役兵缺員時直至新兵入伍期為止之缺員、與其後三十一日間之缺員則應補缺、現將此事廢除矣、在壯丁方面之立塲言之、自徵兵以至入伍相當長期、自己能否入伍、頗感不安、對於謀事亦頗不利、今則解除此種不安之情形矣、在軍隊方面歷來對於補缺兵入伍頗遲、教育亦感不便、今則一律免除、至改正法令自昭和十二年之徵兵卽可實施云云、（十八日同盟電）</p>
<h3>哈拉瑪河一帶西政府軍反攻</h3>
<p>京東南陣地推進五公里　徵預備兵入伍抗戰到底</p>
<p>瑪德里　本社訪員羅林特訊、今晨拂曉、政府軍在瑪德里東南面向國民軍陣地舉行反攻、當卽發生戰爭、雙方均有空軍砲隊坦克車隊　步隊馬隊參加作戰、情形至為激烈、至午前八時許、國民軍抗戰甚力、政府軍亦不示弱、戰况乃愈益猛烈、但至十一時許、政府軍所屬驅逐機用機關槍向敵軍密集之處不絕掃射、國民軍始形不支、迨至午後六時、政府軍乃在桑瑪爾丹特拉凡茄村左近推進三公里之譜、因此瑪德里通至伐倫西亞城之公路已不復歸國民軍控制矣、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>瑪德里　國防委員會發表戰報稱、自最近一星期來、叛軍迭在京南哈拉瑪河一帶、向伐倫西亞大道進撲、希圖切斷京城與伐倫西亞之交通孔道、但迄未得逞、昨日雖又來犯、惟經政府軍迎頭痛擊之後、業已不支而退、并放棄陣地數處、目下政府軍在該處前綫已推進五公里之遙敵軍敗退時、并委棄大批軍火、此外、政府軍所屬軍艦復開砲轟炸西屬摩洛哥休達港之砲台云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿維拉城　本社訪員陶斯比達特訊、政府軍昨在瑪德里南面哈拉瑪河一帶、兩度進攻、來勢均甚猛烈、但結果仍無所擭、先是、政府軍砲隊於淸晨五時三十分、開始向伐倫西亞大道附近及瑪拉諾薩村一帶國民軍最前綫、不斷轟擊、其用意顯在掩護步兵、繞至哈拉瑪河左岸、以襲擊國民軍之後路、當經國民軍用機關槍大砲加以堵截、政府軍所屬民國、遂致進退維谷、無法行動、當時并有坦克車兩輛、被國民軍撀燬、迨至晌午、民團又復再度進擊、希圖衝至國民軍瓖溝、實行肉搏、但仍為國民軍所擊潰、此役結果、國民軍業已小有進展、其前方陣地、亦已益臻强固、至瑪德里西北愛斯戈里亞爾城前綫國民軍、已於昨日午後在　羅勃萊多特哈伐拉鎭附近、佔領重要陣地一處其地足以控制愛斯戈里亞爾城、預計該城陷落之期、當不在遠云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>伐倫西亞　西班牙政政府軍在哈拉瑪河區取强大反攻勢、以保全瑪德里至伐倫西亞之交通後兹政府已下令召集一九三二至一九三六年五年中之各級豫備兵入伍、當局並表示、擬嚴格剔除高級指揮作戰不力之人員、並稱一般人士、現皆主張徵兵制、並不禁止繼續招募志願兵、惟志願兵、須依尋常軍事條件加入常備軍各隊、政府現擬實施强迫戰事工役、並將商諸各工會、以期造成强有力之戰爭工業、及將必要之工廠歸為國有、同時軍事當局巳接有消息、謂政府軍保全首都生命綫之戰事、進行頗順利、聞叛軍已被迫後退在桑瑪爾丁四週者退走尤速云、（中央社十八日路透電）</p>
<p>瑪德里　叛軍飛機今日又向本京及伐倫西亞肆行轟炸、美大使館附近中立區落下炸彈數枚　一彈中比大使館、幸未炸裂、事後調查炸死十一人、傷七十二人、（十八日國民電）</p>

<p>西北剿匪總部</p>
<p>本由蔣委員長任總司令　而以參謀長晏道剛庖代一切、但事實上則由副司令張學良總攬全局、晏氏於事變後、被　扣留、並改組該總部　“聯軍西北臨時軍事委員會”而以五十七軍軍長董必斌（董之原職則由繆澂滄師長升補）代晏為參謀長最初本由張學良𣓾虎城分任軍委會正副委員長嗣又改　正副主任委員、張　陪送蔣委員長入京之際、曾留手諭令由楊虎城于學忠　負軍政全責、惟于在事變後卽飛回蘭州、迄和平解決之　週前、始來西安、其間概由董英斌及王以哲·何柱國·合力支撐局面楊虎城則無多聞問　迨中央軍進城之前數日、楊去三原　理私事董率該部工作人員、遷往邠州辦事、是時王已痛遭戕害、現僅于何留在西安、與行營主任顧視同商量善後事宜、此後該部名義又將再有更易或為甘肅靖綏公署、以便統領其殘餘之部衆因其西安留守處、卽係用此名義故也、</p>
<p>西安綏靖公署</p>
<p>楊虎城於陜變後、仍採用西安綏署名義、行使職權、內部人員、亦未有所更動只交通處長黃念堂因有發軍洛陽促請援救蔣委員長之嫌疑、當被捕去、和平解决之前、終被槍殺、</p>

<p>民政廳長彭昭賢、陝變後解職　由楊虎城之卸任參謀長王一山繼其任、王因兼代省府主任職務、廳政多歸秘書主席米暫沉處理、對於各縣縣長、除長安縣長翁檉於陝變後被羈留（長安民衆、會組織委員會淸算翁任帳目、然亦未聞有何下文）而以孫蔚如之駐省辦公處長韓卓如代理外、餘則未有若何更動、間有少數縣長、變後出走、民廳祇擇附近縣份、委人補充而已、</p>
<p>財政廳</p>
<p>續式甫與楊虎城部軍長馮欽哉、誼屬同鄉、交亦最密、馮會荐其　任綏署辦公廳主任及參議諸職、事變初起、馮卽表示反對、楊虎城以續為人老成持重、兼欲塵馮歡心、故亟以續出長財廳　原任廳長朱鏡宙、接任不過兼旬、卽遇事變、朱與于學忠之私誼亦佳　本可蟬聯、以朱堅辭乃罷續深知個人之為暫局、對於甯前廳畏（甯於事變後驚嚇而死）之舊屬、槪行慰留羅置、加以稅收停滯、無多事務得以平平維持至今、</p>
<p>建設廳</p>
<p>廳長雷寶華雖係陝籍、因與邵力子關係頗深變後、卽表堅辭省府以軍事時期、一切建設、無形停頓、故亦未委人接替雷自亦不安於位、終於斡旋和平之際、偕楊虎城駐京代表李志剛、飛往南京一去不返、迄今此席尚在虛懸中也</p>
<p>教育廳</p>
<p>廳長周學昌任職多年、年來因受本省教育界中人之排斥、辦事日見棘手　又以過激思想、充滿各校學生之腦海、學潮隱伏如去冬學生請願之舉動、卽其一端事變時周乃成為學生攻擊之重的、幸脫險離陝、省府當委周之前任廳長李壽亭繼任　周任人員多被撤換、又以環境關係、而儘量容納有色彩之份子　如西北救國會中堅人物楊明軒之出任小學教師訓練所長、以及江隆基等之接充各中學校長、又其明證、至於學生方面、初頗急進與活躍、嗣因局面不靖、各學生家屬、多强制其子弟歸去、學校乃提前放假、而以不了了之迄今尚未定期開學也、</p>
<p>軍警督察處</p>
<p>軍警督察處長謝珂　頗為各方所推重、在昔本由中央憲乓第三團長楊鎭亞·省會公安局長馬志超·綏署軍法處長張依中·三人兼任副處長、而混合組織成立軍警督察處、以謝為處長、事變後、謝以奔走和平離職、馬楊避去、張又被殺、故由張學良之特務團長孫銘文接充處長　孫為東北軍少壯派將領乏靈魂、力主反抗中央、掀起內戰、後孫殘殺六十七軍長王以哲等四人、圖造成恐怖局面、事後畏罪潛逃、和平旋亦告成、遂由綏署委派省會公安局長王宗山氏兼代處長職矣、</p>
<p>省會公安局</p>
<p>局長馬志超、係陝籍黃埔第一期學員、任職數年，事變之日、公安局會受楊虎城部警備第二旋所圍攻、激戰半日、終致屈服、馬則化裝車夫逃出西安、局長一職、初出孫蔚如，旅長趙壽山充任、趙旋帶兵駐鎭三原、乃以孫之參議王宗山繼任、王為狹省留美學生、歷任甘肅省府委員乃團長司令等職此次奔走和平、頗努力、</p>
<p>戒嚴司令部</p>
<p>陜變之日、孫蔚如卽被張楊任為西安戒嚴司令、旋由東北軍一百零五師師長劉多荃兼任副司令以期共維混亂之局面、當時城防治安、歸孫部警備第二旅、乃一百零五師兩部共同負責、直至和平告成、戒嚴司令部始口裁撤、中央軍人省之前、因警二旅軍紀不良、改調警備第一旅維持市面、尚能相安無事、</p>
<p>保安處</p>
<p>保安處長張坤生　亦黃埔第一期陜籍學員、因其具有少數部隊之武力、當日較公安局之受攻擊為尤烈、張於事變後、亦卽避匿、當由楊虎城另組保安司令部、自任全省保安司令、而以韓威西任參謀長。</p>

<h3>滬埠際隊在港三戰記</h3>
<p>四比三勝香港得埠際錦標　四比一港華聯新軍吃敗仗　一比二敗於最强之港軍聯</p>
<p>（香港通訊）每年一度之港滬埠際足球賽、於本月十一日（即廢曆元旦日）在海軍球塲舉行、時屆三時左右、各棚已告座滿、球迷遲者、皆不得其門而入、賽前由施福陸軍軍樂隊演奏助慶、滬隊此次以淸一色之西人陣勢南下比賽、實力異常雄厚、除在元旦日以四比三之成績挫港埠隊而奪回錦標外、十三日在加路連山塲以四比一之成績勝港華聯隊、故滬埠隊此次南征、成績頗佳、回顧港滬埠隊賽、迄至於今、已舉辦十八屆、計滬隊勝十次負八次、港隊勝八次、負十次、本屆港隊之實力本可勝滬隊者、惜又未能如願以償、致簽城下之盟、一般關心港隊之球迷莫不爲港隊惜也、</p>
<p>比賽於三時半始、滬隊衣白色戰袍、港隊衣藍色戰裳、滬隊在萬餘球迷歡呼聲中、首先推進、勞中鋒大刀闊斧、傳右交鋒、福恩沿綫推進、爲大告山奴所限、惠堂領軍反襲、景祥乘機突進爲馬山兒所掠、水益與景祥短傳推進、歩歩爲營、將球傳至左方、奈乏人接應、無功而還、是時港隊取大包圍勢、威爾遜接應、在離門二十碼平射、不獲中的、未幾、馮神腿小試脚頭、球之去勢甚勁、惜越門而過、滬隊守將抗戰甚力鮑休脱與勃林蓋急爾反攻、俱爲天生與大告山奴擊退、威爾遜在離門咫尺之間、竟將球漏過、大好必勝之良機、竟交臂失之、舉座惋惜、滬隊在重圍中、華特將球遠送出外、勞中鋒接應、閃過大告山奴、天生回軍、鞭長莫及、遂爲勞氏低射中的、先開紀錄中圈再戰、榮照勇戰負塲、港改以十人應戰、滬軍乘此時機由福恩在邊陲發難、傳中適可、大告山奴出、略遲緩、遂爲勞氏用頭球頂入、包是時正欲將球抱住、不料球落地後反彈落鮑休脱之脚前、彼遂迎射空門、球頂柱入網、乃成二比零之局勢、滬隊得此意外收穫軍威大振、福恩無人監視、又被衝過、射中柱頂反彈入網、在上半塲時、滬隊以三比零佔勝、易地再戰、港隊發奮圖强、開賽僅兩分鐘、馮景祥得榮照接濟、輕輕吊送、惠堂左盤右挑、衝過最後防綫、單刀陷城搶回三比一之局勢、惠堂隨至隨射、大可以直搗黄龍、奈鮑賽仲如有神助、撲地救險、竟能挽狂瀾於既倒、滬隊之不失、實屬萬倖、但未幾港隊捲土重來、水益與景祥合拍、馮向左輸送、彈中敵衛之腿部、威爾遜乘勢向右方侵入、撥球入網、成爲三比二之局勢、不料福恩隨到隨射、球之去勢急若閃電、全非家平可救者、港門又告失陷、滬隊又造成四比二之優勢、惠堂仍未稍餒、得機衝刺、遭敵衛三人包圍、撞倒惠堂、判罰十二碼球、李主踢中的、又追回四比三之局勢、再戰移時、各無所獲、天不祐港隊、卒有城下之盟也、再勝華聯又上海埠際代表隊、對本港華聯隊之表演賽、於十三日下午三時半、在加露連山南華球塲舉行、觀衆仍然擁擠、雙方陣勢如次、</p>
<p>中綫開始推動、華隊五虎奮勇而前、鄧廣森中傳陳德輝、德輝一丢眼角色鄒文治舉足一探、球兒應聲入網、首開紀錄、詎知不數分鐘、敵將如狼似虎、殺得華聯人仰馬翻、推勒刦球傳左、鮑休脱一躍而起、頭球入網、成一比一之局、再度開球、華聯已呈衰態、鄧廣森復受傷出塲、數分鐘後、敵鋒施行襲擊、勞拔盤球而前、華隊守將趕救、而球已由小華特脚下、如飛入網、再次接戰、麥兆漢誤犯手球、被罰十二碼、由格林勃主踢、中徐亨胸部、反彈而出、小華特加上一脚、成三與一之比、檸檬過去、易地再戰、華隊各將、竟如病後老人、舉歩維艱、林德譜復因犯規出塲、祗有十人迎戰、幸賴麥黄二將、合力抗敵、徐亨亦小心把關、故敵方雖迭次密射、祇由格林勃射入一球、結果上海隊以四對一之比、大勝華聯隊、敗於軍聯上海埠際足球隊、此次以淸一色西人陣勢來港出席埠際賽、諸健兒精神飽滿、抱必勝之心、於元旦日以四比三之成績擊敗香港隊、奪回埠際錦標、復以四比一之成績挫港華聯隊、連勝兩陣、亦足以自豪、十五日又與軍聯精鋭在掃桿埔球塲會師、此塲比賽、爲滬埠際隊與華東隊南來比賽最精彩之一幕、而豈料滬埠際隊不特未易輕勝軍聯隊、反以二比一之成績爲軍聯隊所敗、致未能保持長勝紀錄、凱旋返滬、而觀戰之軍籍球迷、莫不觀呼若狂、聲震山谷、滬隊之敗於最後之役、殊屬不幸、該隊以在港比賽已畢、凖於十八日（星期四）趁英郵那路打號離港返滬矣、</p>

<h3>評香港之敗於上海</h3>
<p>滬隊衝刺厲害善用兩翼　防衛攻門均在港隊之上</p>
<p>此次埠際足球賽滬隊之操勝、在於上半塲、彼賴鮑仲賽把守鋼門有方、使身軀碩偉之中衛華特與馬山兒等包圍李惠堂、憑驃悍之兩翼作疾馳之反攻、滬隊雖屢屢被圍、每度反攻輙能置港隊於死地、反視港隊前鋒在滬腹地內匍匐不獲進展、</p>
<p>聯絡散漫推進甚緩、兩相比較、有速緩之别、且滬隊之中鋒勞勒司托夫專司衝刺、恒先衝入然後取球、（屢屢犯此規、惜球證對此甚爲失察、）大告山亦被勞氏撞倒多次、其餘四鋒亦能善用英格蘭式之長傳法而衝刺、作之字形之遠傳、見球即衝、衝至即射、嘗使港方門將、無法掩護球門、守將亦疲於奔命、滬隊自勝第二個幸運球後、遂使港軍士氣大受打擊、苟非港隊前鋒屢誤戎機、與球證之裁判失察、則港隊大有扳回四比四和局、而後取勝之希望也、港隊之負、各將因早抱輕敵之心、致有上半塲之失、至下半塲發奮圖强、戮力作戰、竟能扳回三城、且在全局戰事中、攻者凡八九、可見港隊實力有勝滬隊可能、惜自挫其鋭氣、致有噬臍莫及之感、</p>
<p>港隊全軍各部皆露弱點、前鋒採戰略爲狹窄之W形式進攻、其鋭利處在於最尖端比端即爲中鋒李惠堂、全綫五鋒除李能隻身突破敵隊後防數次外、其他前鋒竟不作攻門之嘗試、馮與水益雖有純熟之聯絡、但無補大局、威爾遜與碧福在下半塲始略有進歩、惟在上半塲失機極多、中衛方面、金卑路墨守成法、未能臨機應變、恒與兩中衛作短傳、然後接濟前鋒、使滬隊有佈防之機會、衣雲士勇則勇矣、惜不安於位、時而不顧後方、獨自遠出、致滬隊右翼有充份活動之機絏、故港隊之失球多來自滬隊右翼、衣雲士應負其咎、三中衛則以榮照較佳、後衛方面、想不到老將大告山奴在此役亦表演失常、天生與家平、因告山奴之不穩、</p>
<p>失自信心表演遠不及往日之佳、滬隊善用高球、使五鋒用衝刺法以進取、此實非家平所能勝任、若用羅蘭士、則高球之來、兩內衛可注全力而阻敵鋒、或可减少後顧之憂也、滬隊鮑賽仲實居首功、李惠堂數次力射、均被撲出、惜港隊前鋒無一能衝鋒陷陣、以摇動滬隊後防陣地之人、故滬隊守將遂得從容以應付難關、滬隊先勝三球、然在下塲又有三球之失、可知風勢亦殊有關係、在最後三分鐘時、李惠堂反勾一球、已非門將可能撲及、然天不絶滬隊、馬山兒適站在此處、挽狂瀾於既倒、是乃滬隊之幸、而港隊之不幸也、</p>
<h3>滬華足球隊離港赴粤</h3>
<p>明日在廣州爲方便醫院作募款賽</p>
<p>上海埠際隊改今日北返</p>
<p>中央社香港十八日電　滬華人足球隊一行十三人、由蔣湘青率領、十八日晨八時乘車赴粤、二十爲方便醫院作籌欵賽、又滬埠際足球隊軋許等、原定十八乘英郵納爾特拉號返滬、因該輪延遲抵港、改十九日北返、</p>
<p>香港十七日電　華東隊十七年四時在加路連山與港聯隊作表演賽、李寗因傷未出、改以顧尚勷蔣兆祥任左右後衛、馮運佑王克厚任中左兩中衛、餘無變、因前鋒軟弱、聯絡無方、十分後、即被港隊小告山奴射入一球、五分後李安納用頭撞入一球、地諾聲小告山奴復各建一功、上半華東只有招架、無還攻力、下半華東力圖恢復、十分後羅斗文初次射門、但被擋出、反被港隊胡禮自三十碼外射一遠球中的、加以劉始讚犯規被罰十二碼自由球、由港守門羅蘭士主踢、一踢而入、門將相遇、亦罕見也、港隊以勝負已定、持盈保泰、不復猛攻、華東乘時回擊、曾數次射門、均未奏效、結果以零比六敗績、該隊在港表演已畢、决十八赴省</p>
<h3>進德穩取晨聯錦標</h3>
<p>尚餘兩次比賽即敗亦無問題</p>
<p>西聯足球晨聯組秩序尚餘二塲、現進德已九戰九勝、尚餘對震且及猶太各一塲、以進德之實力、不難全勝、故錦標已在掌握之中、即使失敗、亦無問題矣、形勢如下、</p>
<h3>中英擊彈精彩一幕張英達昨勝克拉克</h3>
<p>比賽結果六○○比四一五分　今日末一塲朱其良對聶克爾</p>
<p>中英擊彈、已賽四組、中華勝三敗、歷次戰况、要以昨日張英達與克拉克最有精彩、張英達昨勝克拉克一八五分、得力於最後三槍、而中間雙方表演之佳妙、分數上下之競爭、觀者均爲之神往、今日下午五時半中華隊第一組朱其良對英國聶克爾、仍在南京路八十八會內舉行、朱之技藝、高於對方、勝利不成問題、本屆錦標、因此必歸中華無疑、</p>
<p>張英達昨日所予我人之印象甚佳、其擅長之開能、以及送彈自落等技藝、均在輕鬆流利中演出、一槍八十三分、由於各種方式而造成、博得滿堂天采、爲其最近數月來得意之傑作、</p>
<p>開塲二人並駕齊驅、相差不過十分上下、最多距離三十餘分而已、張英達每居克拉克之先、迨至一槍四十二、再槍八十三、克拉克乃落後一百二十四分之多、（四八九比三六五）最後又加一槍四十三分、克拉克遂無勝利希望、終以四一五比六○○失敗、</p>
<p>張英達　二二·三八·三○·五二·二九·三一·四二·八三·四三·</p>
<p>克拉克　二○·三○·二一·二○·</p>

<p>本報特訊　胡祖蔭調查</p>
<p>二·校舍與設備</p>
<p>該校現分三部：第一部是在尚文路，佔地二畝八分餘，校舍是在民國三年建築的，主要部份是横凹字式。第二部是在文廟路，佔地約有四畝，是利用劉公愍忠二祠充作校舍。第三部是在滬閔路吳家巷，校基頗廣，佔地約有五十畝。此處校舍是新建的，在民國二十三年七月興工建築，過了四個月，方才完成。</p>
<p>第三部校舍是一字式，分二層，樓上下中隔走廊，兩旁均爲教堂，共有十八間。後因寄宿生激增，所建新舍，不敷應用；又於二十四年七月興建平房宿舍兩所。最近該校又有籌欵興建體育館兼作大禮堂的計劃。此外，新校舍因爲校基的廣闊，而且處於幽静的鄉村環境中，所以校景方面甚爲美麗；且有校園，茅亭，草地，池塘的佈置，更是兒童良好的讀書與遊息的處所。</p>
<p>在設備方面，該校對於教學設備，如儀器，標本，圖書及體育用具等，每學期均酌量添置，俾便應用。據二十五年的統計，該校共有儀器四七一件，標本二一二件，教職員參考用書二七四五本、兒童圖書二二三九本，體育及童子軍用具七二六件，其他用具四五二六件，器皿三○三四件。</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>三品慘跌紗市愈感不安</p>
<p>倉庫囤積增高　同業傾向抛賣　現貨走勢雖暢　其如壓力重重</p>
<p>紗市趨疲、且跌風重起、良以紙幣問題謡言平息、同時大阪三品紗市慘落、遠月破進四十元關口、於是人心震撼、賣方紛起、市價乃轉趨下游、但現紗客方需求尚稱不薄、蜀帮亦發展、惟同業中鑒於倉庫囤積、繼長增高、一味傾向抛賣矣、</p>
<p>標紗跌二元强</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、近月因印商收貨而堅、拍至遠期轉趨下挫、蓋以大阪三品紗市歩歩下墮、加之紙幣問題、市場謡諑較爲平息、人心平淡、但本月多方限價五十五元放出、故市情愈覺穩定、惟同業大部傾向抛出、壓力亦重、結果各月比上日收盤價跌二角至一元二角、午後開盤、市情忽變、以大阪三品紗市不支、收盤下降、且打破四十元關門、於是人心恐虚、賣方乘機高壓、跌風尤幟、結果各月比上午收盤價再跌五角至一元三四角、查賣出吉豐一千一百包、裕大一千三百五十包、益記八百五十包、大昌成二千五百包、長豐七百包、恒昌一千七百包、恒益九百包、潤康一千四百包、永大一千四百包、生源五百五十包、買進大孚一千一百包、振大一千二百包、賡豐四千三百五十包、森康一千二百包、恊成一千五百包、裕大一千○五十包、錦昌一千六百包、昶記八百包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>棉花受紗牽制</p>
<p>棉市平庸、且氣勢衰弱、因美棉萎靡不振、人心甚挫、午後以紗市歩歩下降、唇齒相依之棉市、被其牽入漩渦中、遠月跌破五元關口矣、</p>
<p>標花跌六角半</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各有市價微見下落、因美棉漲跌互見、上下二至五磅音、印棉停市、海外棉業狀况仍乏生色、故市况平凡、同時紗市回挫、買者較稀、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一角至一角半、午後開盤、市氣尚能和平、繼以紗價趨跌、受其影響、至收盤時跌風驟熾、結果各月比上午收盤價大跌四角半至五角、查賣出益康三千三百擔、吉豐二千九百擔、合興二千七百擔、仁豐一千八百擔、源興昌四千九百擔、達記一千擔、長餘二千一百擔、元一二千四百擔、益昶三千擔、長豐三千一百擔、同和一千四百擔、興昌一千七百擔、買進裕大一萬四千四百擔、錦昌四千四百擔、愼記三千五百擔、元一二千一百擔、賡豐五千五百擔、新昶三千六百担、通記一千三百担、德大一千担、長豐一千三百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>棉花廠辦轉呆</p>
<p>現棉消費轉趨沉悶、因期棉下跌、廠方停滯、來源亦未開、</p>
<p>三品紗花跌風日盛</p>
<p>十八日大阪電、現紗跌二至五元、十六支扇面二百三十三元、跌三元、二十支金魚二百五十三元、跌二元、四十支五星四百元、跌五元、四十二支雉子三百七十八元、跌四元、三品期紗跌二元三角至六元五角、近月爲二百四十二元四角、遠月爲二百四十元○七角、又花跌八角至四角五分、近月爲七十二元八角、遠月爲七十四元一角五分、</p>
<p>美新棉外商套售</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况稍見活動、大部爲同業交易、價由不動至跌三磅音、三月期因多頭了結及套賣而跌、旋以同業及合作社買進而回、私家估計、押欵棉花約售去三十五萬包、華盛頓消息、貨物貸欵社對於出售押欵棉花之條件、目下不至更改、收盤時、因套賣及外商抛售新棉、市况疲軟、計現貨跌八磅音、期貨跌五磅音至漲三磅音、英棉現貨跌三點、期貨跌一點、印棉停市、原電錄左、（十七日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十八日開盤預測、白羅溪爲二百二十二羅比、奥姆辣爲二百○三羅比、平果爾爲一百七十七羅比、均跌一羅比半、</p>
<p>紗布存紗繼長增高</p>
<p>華商紗布交易所倉庫中存紗量、截至二月十六日止、統計一萬七千八百十包、其中十支紗有八千九百六十包、二十支紗有八千五百包、十六支紗僅三百五十包、兹將紗牌支别摘錄如下、</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>東疋期貨開至五六月</p>
<p>昨日布市、因津帮及本街連日東疋細布細斜交易仍旺、日商洋行期貨已開至五六月份、昨續開龍頭等牌細布五百餘包、價與現貨售盤相埒、天津及本街色布號家搜羅現貨期貨細布細斜近千件、故棉紗花雖連續回跌、市價仍維持有力、白貨售價一致堅定、定嗶嘰綫呢市上去路漸弱、係因時令關係、四君子嗶嘰挫跌（每碼）一厘二毫半、餘貨亦告平疲、本廠細布細斜粤閩湘皖添辦尚繁、花色貨條素府綢藍布色斜綫呢嗶嘰印花色丁花布等貨去胃亦佳、川滇魯豫等地駐滬莊客頗多回籍度歳、尚未返申辦貨、青島布疋交易所昨日起開拍標凖站橋牌細布、牛前開盤九元二角二分半、收盤價九元二角七分半、午後平平云、</p>
<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>因無現貨流通復興債狂漲三元</p>
<p>統一漲風似覺稍息</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、漲風已告停頓、形勢趨於盤旋、多方仍有緩緩出籠之象、進户雖有、不若前之踴躍、所傳消息、仍在恍惚迷離之中、趨勢或將稍稍盤小、人心依然堅强、本月已無多日、存賬數目尚鉅、依十號及四十三號等不斷賣出、暫時恐不易再漲、昨日經過、開盤人心仍佳、散户買進不少、而五號六號十號及四十三號等紛紛賣出、市價雖略形抬高三四角、形勢已覺不振、次盤上列各家、繼續賣出、十一號亦轉進爲出、十四·三十八及五十四號稍有買進、市况已緩緩趨疲、大都略小一二角左右、結果仍屬一致上漲一角半至四角不等、獨復興公債、交易極少、因外間絶無現貨流通、空方抵補、祇有忍痛斬割、故又狂漲三元、此則不可與各統一公債同日語焉、成交總數、共計六百九十一萬五千元、兹將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>麪粉急轉直下</p>
<p>浮多似已放棄近期</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初穩繼則瀉跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥近期不動、遠好一二角、坎拿大近亦不動、遠好四分一角不等、當開價時、以洋麥報價尚穩、開價與前相仿、不過本月份距交割時間、祗一星期左右、而塲上之浮多籌碼、數尚盛暢、因脱手之暢、市面遂又急轉直下、歩歩傾跌、良因近期廠方雖有收回、實銷去路、並不十分貪辦、故又側重重實、多頭不得不放棄也、七月份新粉、因業外大户拉進、故跌度反差、照此情形、多頭舍近圖遠、新陳或有逐漸别近之勢云、</p>
<p>各路存麥尚豐期麥鋭跌一角左右</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、近期市面因洋麥報價微振、人心尚穩、遠期新麥、因天時正常、有益麥苗、故開價即軟、二盤以後、因粉市見跌頗暴、且各路存麥頗豐、春節之後、有源源裝申之説、是以人心大虚、瀉跌亦盛、至新麥因天時甚佳、抛户甚暢、跌勢轉狂、如七月份至收盤、跌一角半之巨、後歩情形、如粉銷無起色、近期當須跟落、六七月份之新麥、則與天時大有關係也、現麥市面、因標凖又跌、廠方抑價、各檔又跌七八分、開山東洋河管店蚌埠張八嶺麥六元六角三分、東葛麥六元六角、江北麥六元五角七八分、宿遷瑶灣麥六元四角、次三角、南京麥六元五角二分、由福新辦五千包、阜豐辦八千包云、</p>
<p>標準油豆餅供過於求</p>
<p>行號及大連帮均有套出</p>
<p>標凖油豆餅市、被大連影響、形勢逐見不振、大連電訊逐日盤小、且連豆等現貨亦有整批到申、行號與大連帮莫不在市套出、而實銷祗有本街應酬、客帮尚乏整批銷路、因業外囤户亦不敢暢收、標凖市價隨見歩下、昨日交易雖旺、終以供過於求、油豆餅一致下跌、標油小七角、至四角半、標餅小一·二·三分、標豆小一角三分至九分不等、</p>
<p>大連存貨充溢</p>
<p>黄豆市面難抱樂觀</p>
<p>昨日黄豆市况在大連頻跌之下、人心一味下游、四平街豆慘落角外、榨油廠趁賤殺進二十六車、價爲六元、刻照大連市態、尤恐難以樂觀、良以該埠存貨充溢、洋莊銷塲暫居停手、且散處各地之底貨、在此春暖解凍之候、不免趕集、致有以上情形、本市頗受影響、其他車豆等難免株連、主因油廠車家園坊等銷塲勢必被東北豆所佔據、所以市塲人心已見恐惶、昨祗開滙溪口豆一車、丁家州豆一車、及漢口乍豆一千二百包、九江遲豆三百包而已、</p>
<p>河米惟陰元需求較旺</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到三十餘號、貨約六千三四百石、內中薄稻有十三四號、本街銷塲仍滯、包胃亦然、價削小後稍有動辦、計天津青島西安等帮辦去薄稻二千餘包、而市况仍難支持、結果厚粳行情續低角許、薄稻又貶一角至角外不等、杜洋尖乏貨無市、陰元到稀銷旺、提升一二角、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來船二十六七艘、河下存船頗多、店胃仍未見起色、各貨銷路微細、市形頂白粳價疲數分、中下者小一角左右、早稻貨少價平、薄稻小近角、羊尖價小角許、埠杜客尖及白元價疲軟數分、其餘各貨價亦見疲勢、</p>
<p>客秈缺乏整批交易</p>
<p>—貨主正在削價求售—</p>
<p>昨客秈市况、雖本客繼續辦裝、而形勢終見無神、客帮汕頭尚活、北洋與西安續有辦裝、然去數均微、而去胃最暢之粤帮、仍無整票辦裝、據説粤省目下存到兩旺、市價已見歩歩低落、滬上市價較昂、尚難合劃、故已多日未辦、粤銷既呆、人心尤虚、而貨主反以到頭與途貨兩充、意在急於售脱、故高米續削五六分、中次者又小七八分一角外、全日開出贛米七千九百五十包、湘米百五十包、其他均無成交、</p>

<h3>統一與和平一</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>㊀</p>
<p>“統一與和平”這個題目，好像是一座天平，一邊是“統一，”一邊是“和平，”中間的一個“與”字就是天平的槓捍，把兩邊的重量來權衡一下。“統一”與“和平”中間究竟有什麼關係呢？我們時常聽到“和平統一，”又常常聽到“統一和平，”這兩句話都講得通，所以可以説“統一”與“和平”質量均等，彷佛孟子所譬喩的魚與熊掌。如果照題目中的順序，應該先講“統一”後講“和平，”不過因為現在的國家民族的最普遍最迫切的需要是和平，所以先講和平。</p>
<p>為什麼現在的國家民族普遍最迫切的需要是和平呢？可以分兩點來説明：</p>
<p>第一，就人類的本性及中國國民的民族性來説，我們的確愛好和平。人類的本性是什麼？是生，不是死。祇要看本性的“性”字是從心從生，可見“性”就是好生存的心。“好生惡死，人之常情，”沒有人可以否認的。還有一句老話：“天地之大德曰生。”天地生萬物，人是萬物之靈，當然本着天地之大德而求生。怎樣才能生呢？我可以説一定要和平才能生。譬如春天風和日暖，草木萌芽滋長，所以説春天有生氣有朝氣，到了秋天，祇要秋風一起，梧桐葉落，草木凋零，所以説秋天有肅殺之氣。草木尚且一定要風和日暖才能生長，何况人類豈有不希望和平之理？再從中國的民族性來説，中國人是格外愛好和平的。根據中國幾千年來的歷史，沒啊一次想亡人的國，滅人的種，使別國的人不能同我們一樣生存，决不像現在帝國主義一般。諸位想一想，有許多國家從前與中國往來數千年，始終沒有亡國，可是他們現在與帝國主義往來，不到數十年，國家早已滅亡了。這種例子很多，不必列舉，只要看看朝鮮安南就可明白。這足以顯示中華民族一向是寬大的，希望同別國共存共榮，所抱的完全是主張和平的王道思想。在古書裹，像“繼絕世，興廢國，治亂持危，朝聘以時，厚往而薄來”等類的敎訓很多。所謂“繼絕世，”就是説，已經絕了的世代，我們還得想方法使他繼續下去。所謂“興廢國”就是説，已經亡了的國家，還得使他復興起來。所謂“厚往而薄來，”就是説，我們中國對於鄰國的熊度，儘管他們所送來的少，而我們所頒給的不妨較多。這種精神，與帝國主義的辦法完全不同；帝國主義的態度是榨取剝削，使弱小民族亡國滅種，當然連他的文化同歸於盡。中國的民族性却懷念着以德服人的王道，而排斥那以力人的霸道的。所以從中國的民族性上看來，的確是最愛好和平。</p>
<p>第二，從辛亥革命以後我們的經騐和目前的環境來説，格外感覺到和平的需要。自辛亥革命以後，因為帝制餘孽的作祟，軍閥地盤的割據，使得全國戰禍連年不斷，人民在水深火𤍠之中，精神物質都飽受戰爭的痛苦，那一個人不希望和平，不盼望把戰爭化為和平呢？人同此心，心同此理，在痛苦經騐之中得到了覺悟，以為惟有和平才能安居樂業，才能使國家强盛，民族復興。過去的痛苦經騐已使人人產生了這一個覺悟，就是希望和平。更就目前的國際環境來看，大家都在嚷着集體安全，希望能夠共同維持世界和平。我們以積弱的國家，處於各帝國主義勢力夾攻之中，當然更渴望在國際和平的環境裹，努力造成一個現代的國家。如果沒有和平。當然談不到建設，也更當然沒有增進國力的可能，更何望抵抗外來的壓迫？所以“和平”的確是現在我們國家民族最普遍最迫切的需要了</p>
<p>而且，去年一年之中，有許多很危險的事情，都能逢兇化吉，化險為夷。這是什麼緣故呢？就是因為全國的民衆無形之中發動一種偉大的力量。由於這種大力量所以能感格一切。這種大力量從什麼地方發動出來的呢？從全民族希望和平的偉大精神上發出來的。現在我們的國家，已經到了一個需要和平的時期；我們的民族歷史，也已經蹈上了開始復興的時期，因此任何力量想要阻礙這個趨勢，是做不到的。惟其人人希望和平，社會上就充滿着和平康樂的氣象，這個國家當然蓬勃向上，轉到復與；假使社會上充滿了鬥爭的空氣，祇曉得怨恨殘暴，不曉得合作協調，那麼這個國家一定是紛亂如麻。我們中國經過二十多年戰爭的痛苦，大家希望和平，所以去年有了大轉機，兩廣事變和西安叛變，都能化險為夷。不但人事方面如此，天時方面也是如此，農產有了很好的收獲，國民經濟也可望欣欣向榮。（未完）</p>

<p>新生活運動三周年紀念特刋</p>
<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<h3>新生活運動三週紀念特刊總會過去一年工作的回顧</h3>
<p>— 錢大鈞</p>
<p>“前事不忘，後事之師”。我們當此新生活運動二週年紀念的時候，試本着這個意思，來把本會過去一年的工作，作扼要的檢討。</p>
<p>本會過去一年的工作，大概可分三方面來敘述：一，經常工作，二，季節工作，三，其他重要工作。</p>
<p>一·經常工作</p>
<p>經常工作為規矩淸潔兩項運動的繼續推行，由本會訂定一新生活運動兩種經常中心工作，”卽包含淸潔運動和規矩運動，印發各級新運曾照行。並在首都方面，督促首都新運會切實推進。</p>
<p>二·季節工作</p>
<p>季節工作為：㊀春季，種植運動，㊁夏季，衛生運動，㊂秋季，節約這動，㊃冬季，救濟運動。</p>
<p>（一）春季種植運動，本至重要，並富有意義。但因適值本會由贛遷京及改組內部等關係，未及實施。</p>
<p>（二）夏季衛生運動，以督促國民注意衛生，减少疾疫，促進健康為目的。對於全國方面，本會預為規定工作綱領二十六項。通吿各地新運會自五月二十日起至八月二十日止，為舉行夏季衛生運動期間，對於各項工作，劃分步驟，按期進行。通吿出發以後，各省市各鐵路新運會，先後具報組織夏令衛生運動委員會，並附送各種章則及實施辦法到會。均經分別群加審核，其中間有不合之處，便予修正。兹將工作綱領二十六項錄下，藉明內容；㊀舉行夏令衛生運動宣傳週，㊁散會傳單粘貼標語及廣播衛生講演，㊂舉行大掃除，㊃電影院幻燈宣傳，㊄舉行衛生展覽，㊅舉行防疫注射，㊆舉行公廁消毒，㊇淸理池塘溝渠，㊈舉行挨戶滅蠅滅蚊指導，㊉舉行井水消毒，㊉㊀推廣食用自來水，㊉㊁取締隨地吐痰，㊉㊂取締隨地便溺，㊉㊃舉行旅棧公寓衛生指導，㊉㊄舉行茶樓酒館衛生指導、㊉㊅舉行娛樂塲所衛生指導，㊉㊆舉行浴室衛生指導，㊉㊇舉行理髮店衛生指導，㊉㊈舉行菜塲衛生指導，㊁㊉舉行攤販衛生指導，㊁㊉㊀舉行冷食店衛生指導，㊁㊉㊁舉行肉店衛生指導，㊁㊉㊂舉行豆腐店衛生指導，㊁㊉㊃舉行汽車夫人力車夫衛生指導，㊁㊉㊄舉行車站衛生指導，㊁㊉㊅舉行碼頭衛生指導。</p>
<p>對於首都方面，本會派員會同首都各界，組織首都夏令衛生運動委員會，作廣大的衛生運動。為適應首都夏季衛生上的實際需要，曾舉辦以下各事項：㊀對推行人員及各業工友實施衛生訓練，㊁舉行衛生運動宣傳週，㊃檢查及勸導機關學校娛樂塲所及其他，㊃勸導一般住戶商店實行衛生規約，㊄舉行防疫滅蠅滅蚊運動，㊅提倡勞動服務，實行清潔掃除，㊆推廣飲用自來水，商請自來水管理處减低水價及裝費，㊇取締違反衛生規約事件，㊈印發衛生手冊，指導市民，㊉辦理衛生展覽。</p>
<p>由上説來，去年由本會發動的全國夏季衛生運動，計劃相當周詳，推行也頗為盡力，積極的良好應響，雖未易估計，然消極方面，似已生相當效力，去年夏季全國疾疫减少，卽其一證，今後仍當繼續努力。</p>
<p>（三）秋季節約運動，在以簡單樸素迅速確實的精紳，厲行節約，藉以充實人力財力及物力，及使國民各樂所業，以助成國民經濟建設的目的。因節約運動也是國民經濟建設運動委員會總會的去年工作綱領之一，本會乃和該會洽商共同努力，於八月一日成立聯合辦事處，由本會草訂“節約運動實施辦法”，經辦事處開會審查通過，遂通吿國民經濟建設委員會各分支會，及各省市路僑新生活運動促進會，限於九月二十一日起遵照推行，並按期加以檢查。</p>
<p>節約運動的工作範圍，計分以下四種：</p>
<p>甲，惜時運動，項目有三：㊀提倡早起早睡，㊁嚴守工作及約會時間勸禁　似賭博的娛樂。</p>
<p>乙，節用運動，項目有四，㊂費用宜儉省，㊁饋贈酬答勿奢華，㊂宴會宜簡潔，㊃提倡儲蓄及保險。</p>
<p>丙，愛物運動，項目有三：㊀提倡國貨，㊁愛惜公物，㊂利用廢物，</p>
<p>丁，樂業運勸，項目有四：㊀提高一般人對於職業的興趣，使有業者樂業，無業者創業。㊁閑睱時加入勞動服務團，從事於築路，造林，修堤，及其他公共事業。㊂提倡鄉村副業，俾利用農人。增加富力。㊃利用節存之金錢，單獨或聯合戚友，從事於生產事業。</p>
<p>去年節約運動的結果，社會奢靡及墮落的風氣，已挽回不少，但要收大效，仍待今後全國新運工作同志，公務員，暨各界領袖，切實提倡。</p>
<p>（四）冬季救濟運動，因對各地原有救濟機關或團體未盡明瞭，故先從調查着手。本會除製訂調查表印發各地新運會會限期塡報外，並派員分赴首都市各振濟會社調查，藉明各該會社的組織，工作，經費，籌振及放振方法，以供製訂救濟運動方案的參考。</p>
<p>三·其他重要工作</p>
<p>其他重要工作，約可分為以下十一種：㊀派遺視察團，㊁推行航輪新運，㊂試辦大學生暑期農村服務，㊃指導全國大露營大檢閱女童軍作農村服務，㊄取締額外小賬運動，㊅整頓上海市新運，㊆舉辦廣東新運，㊇推進全國婦女新運，㊈舉辦夕陽會，㊉實施全國各業工友新生活訓練，㊉㊀組織戰地服務團。</p>

<p>（一）推行航輪新運　關於此項，可分兩點説明：㊀恊助交通部實施整理航輪辦法，自去年四月一日起，已經辦到下列各項：甲，取消買辦制，而代以事務主任。乙，賣船票外，不另賣鋪位。丙，茶房由局每月付薪，由十六元起碼。丁，小帳規定為票價十分之一，不得額外需索。戊，訂定取締無票乘輪辦法。己，訂定招商局工友獎懲辦法，㊁組織招商局及其他民營輪船公司茶房新生活訓練班，各輪茶房，輪流受訓，每班以二個月為期，授以新生活須知，服務知識，軍事訓練，黨義，及衛生等科目。</p>
<p>自推行航輪新運以來，我國航輪管理及人事等方面的陋習或積弊，大半已滌除凈盡，商旅莫不稱便。</p>
<p>（三）試辦大學生暑期農村服務團　為使大學生利用暑假機會，服務農村，改進農民生活，及喚起農民對國家的觀念起見，試辦新生活運動暑期農村服務團。學校及工作區域，當限於江浙兩省。本會訂定簡章，編製暑期農村服務手冊，分發各團員，俾服務有所依據。並發各團員證明書，以資識別。同時由本會通吿各地方政府及新運會，請其恊助，以利進行，計全校學生加入本團工作的，有中央政治學校一校三百餘人；個人自動加入的，有南京中央大學，金陸大學，蘇州東吳大學，杭州浙江大學，上海滬江大學，暨南大學等等十三校六十六人。結果據各團員的工作報吿看來，工作進行，誠不免有種種困難和障礙，然以各團員精誠服務，凡曾受指導的農民，都對本團有良好印象和批評。今後擬本着去年的經騐，設法將暑期農村服務，推行全國。</p>
<p>（四）指導全國大露營大檢閱女童軍作農村服務去年十月中國童子軍第二次大檢閱大露營時候，童子軍總會邀請本會合作指明女童子軍農村服務，當經商定服務地點為陵園附近九個農村，服務事項為指導農家及農村茶店理髮店飯店等塲所的淸潔衛生，服務時間為十月八日下午一時至九時，並先期準備應用物品。每村派女童子軍一小隊，由辦事處派員率領，警廳派警隨時照料，本會派員指導監督評判。結果發見女童子軍對於社會服務一項，均缺乏經騐，今後似有特別注意訓練的必要。</p>
<p>（五）取締額外小帳運動　查各地公共塲所的茶房，每向客人索取額外小帳，此項惡習旣能助長奢侈之風，且易養成人民階級觀念，殊背新運主旨，為實行節約，提高茶房品性及自尊心起見，有澈底加以改革的必要。本會因此於去年七月間訂定取締額外小帳運動辦法，大約在正帳加一之外，不得向客人索取額外小費，如茶房索取，客人當加拒絕，如客人給與，茶房當加拒絕。通吿各新運會切實　行。先後據各地具報遵照辦理均有相當成效。本會對首都方面，復注意指導，切實推行。</p>
<p>（六）整頓上海市新運本會以據視察團報吿上海市新運工作不切實際，有整頓的必要，特擬定“改善上海市新運推行方法，”內容大要分為：㊀籌增人員及經費，㊁從公務員推行，㊂推行學校新運，㊃訓練警察推行新運。派員與該會會商討論，加以整頓。</p>
<p>（七）舉辦廣東新運　去年兩廣事變，廣東首先和平解决，本會於八月間派員前往推行新運時。會長尚在粵，卽秉承會長意旨，决定工作步驟：㊀籌備，㊁組織廣東省暨廣州市新運會，㊂訓練新運幹部人員及憲警，㊃推行，由各機關以及社會團體公共塲所，由各機關長官及一般公務員再及一般民衆。此外為使新運意義深入人心起見，自九月十日起曾舉行新運宣傳週，用種種方法擴大宣傳。至於婦女工作委員會的組織，市容的整頓，標語的印製，以及其他各項計晝，或參加指導，或負責設計，均無不盡力。</p>
<p>（八）推進全國婦女新運　過去一年中，全國各地婦女，在本會婦女指導之下，厲行新運。其已成立婦女工作委員會，或婦女新運會，或婦女生活改進會的，有首都，浙江，陝西，湖南，江蘇，山西，靑海，廣東，上海，浙江溪口等十處。全國婦女已成立的新生活勞動服務團，計有三十九團，團員六千六百餘人，其中學校方面占十六團，團員二千一百九十七人。今後擬將已成立之婦女新運組織加以調整，並在未成立婦女新運工作委員會的地方從事組織。兼在各地極力增設婦女勞動服務團。</p>
<p>（九）舉辦夕陽會　本會為訓練民衆增進團體娛樂及改善團體生活起見，經工作會議决議由同人公餘生活改進會負責舉辦夕陽會。開會地點係在京市第一公園東北角的草地上開會時間定於每星期四下午七時起。自七月十六日起，至九月二十四日止，除七月三十日間斷一次外，共連續舉行了十次。每次開會程序，俱有新生活講演，遊藝。第五次起增加敎導項目，如第五次為唱黨歌，第六次“升降國旗要敬禮第七次“待人要有禮貌”第八次對於婦孺怎樣才算有禮貌第九次“如何愛護公物及注意公德”等，尤有意義。到塲民衆，由第一次千餘人起，以後續有增加，至最末一次，增至約六千人之多。</p>
<p>（十）實施全團各業工友新生活訓練　此處所稱各業工友，暫以在㊀酒菜飯館，㊁飲茶社，㊂旅館，㊃浴室，㊄理髪店，㊅娛樂塲所，等地服務為限。本會為喚起彼等國家觀念，勸導彼等力行新生活，培養彼等服務精神，及增進彼等股務技術起見，製訂各叢工友新生活訓練計畫大網，於去年八月間，通吿各地新運會施行。該大網內容分為：甲，原則，乙，範圍，丙，材料，丁，方法及步驟，戊，時間，己，經費等項。對於首都方面之各業工友訓練，本會並派員視察指導。</p>
<p>（十一）組織戰地服務團　匪偽犯綏，全國憤慨，政府旣抱剿滅决心，前方國軍將士，也能奮不顧身，為國效命。本會為提倡為國服務精神，鼓舞民衆救國𤍠情，及對前方將士表示援助和鼓勵起見，特組織戰地服務團，前往綏遠一帶，為戰地將士及民衆服務。計於去年十二月七日開始徵求團員，十日止，各界靑年前來報名者達一百二十餘人。考試結果，取錄二十人，卽予正式組織成立。自十五日起實施訓練，過程分軍訓，精神訓話，新運須知，及救護等項，並舉行名人演講。預定出發後工作，分為三大項：㊀救濟，㊁慰勞，㊂通訊，原定二十日左右出發，適以會長蒙難西安，故臨時改變計畫，决先行赴陝赴難，然後再赴綏遠，本會職員也有多人報名參加。旋以會長出險返京，該團乃復改變計畫，决定本年一月內出發綏遠服務。</p>
<p>本會過去一年的工作，大要如上述。有的須待今後的繼續推行，如清潔運動，規矩運動，種植運動，衛生運動，節約運動，救濟運動，及推進全國婦女新運之類。有的須待今後的繼續舉辦，如派遣視察團，舉辦夕陽會之類。有的須待今後的積極推廣，如推行航輪新運，學生暑期農村服務，實施工友新生活訓練之類。細加覆按，各項工作，大概均有其相當的意義和價值。唯是新生活運動，為國民生活革命的運動，又是復興民族的運動，此種運動决不是短期內所能完成也絕不是少數的人所能葴事。今後本會同人仍須以試騐創造精神，不斷試騐，不斷創造，大處着眼，小處着手，使新運工作，能有不斷的進展。同時希望全國各地同志暨各界領袖繼續努力積極進行。尤望全國同胞自覺過去生活不合時代與環境，足以引起內憂，招致外侮，有實行生活革命的必要，而身體力行。值兹新運三週年紀念，第四年工作起始開展的時候，本會同人願與各地工作同志各界領袖和全國同胞，共同策　，共同努力！</p>

<h3>粗獷的美</h3>
<p>— 荃麟</p>
<p>粗獷的美，這樣一個名詞，也許會引起你的誤解，以爲我們是要來提倡汚穢，不整潔，雜亂的生活——這顯然是不「文明」的。我們這裏需要説明，這並不是我們終極的目的；我們最後所求的，是人類精神上與物質上並等的美，是人類真實的美。當那樣一個時代到來時，我們將看見那樣一件美麗的生活：人類是自由而活潑的，强健而富庶的，整齊而有規律的，爲大衆利益而共同勞働的，有如太陽一般的愉快而熱情的。但這樣的時代還很遥遠——雖然我們可以確信牠將到來。在現在，我們爲努力追求這樣一個目標，我們首先得要把舊時代虚僞的，病態的，以别人的血汗來修飾自己的美底概念剥除了。當你這樣做時，你會看到現代社會生活下勞苦者的反抗底容貌，肉體緊張，以及從汚穢，粗暴，無禮貌，强烈的生活中看到人類真實的靈魂，以及人類真正可愛的地方——由於這一切要素所組成的，便是粗獷的美底全部。</p>
<p>換句話説，從一羣五股汗淋，筋肉怒突的船夫底喉嚨中所發出宏亮的，悲壯的勞働合唱，或從一張汚穢的，太陽炙焦的臉上浮出來的一絲純樸的，不能非難的獰笑，這在你看來（假使你也是屬於社會大衆的一個），不會比頭上塗着白粉的紳士們底幽雅舉止，或以脂粉與香水爲營養的淑女們底甜蜜微笑更覺嫵媚可愛嗎？</p>
<p>從文學上來舉出這樣的例子，最好莫如把却爾司·狄更斯的人物與馬克星·高爾基的人物作一個對照，狄更司無疑是十七世紀中描寫人物最成功的一個人，他的技巧是值得學習的。但是他的每本小説中的人物幾乎有一種一定的格式，即凡是作者認爲是善良的人物，却是一些温文，慈愷，端莊和像鴿子般的馴柔的，而被作者認作惡人的，多是醜陋，汚穢，粗暴，整天在咒駡，和不信上帝的。他把這種醜和美都寫得非常極端，甚至善人在困苦的環境中也不失其鴿子般的馴良，而惡人在優俗境中，也到處顯露其粗獷的弱點。當你讀這樣作品時，就會深刻地印進作者那種美的概念，而無意地把人類分成優美的，文明的一部分——上帝的選民，和醜陋的，汚俗的平凡的一部分，而在客觀上即滋長了高帽階級應該統治大多數人民的意識。但當你讀到高爾基的小説時，你却相反的會驚愕於他書中的主人翁，幾乎都是襤褸的，粗獷的一羣——私販，逃亡者，船夫，飢餓的農民，盗賊，上帝的叛徒。凡狄更司用以形容他書中的反角者，高爾基都加在他的主人翁身上，如稻草般的亂髮，褐色的短剛的髭鬚，紅爛的眼睛，汚皺的皮膚，幾乎到處可以見到。當你和這些主人初接觸時，你也許會感覺可憎和可笑，但當你漸漸和他們熟識了，你會忽然感覺他們可愛起來，而當你讀完牠時，你將感覺你的靈魂和這些粗獷的人們融合了，甚至他們的一顰一笑，在這時都對你是嫵媚的，美麗的了；而這一種美感决非從紳士們中間所能獲得的。真的，高爾基是以他那麽偉大的筆，給我們顯示出人類靈魂中的美麗，和使我們從粗獷中去看到人類可愛的地方。</p>
<p>這樣的美的概念當自然主義開始的時候，實已經萌芽了，當米蘭拒絶了政府叫他畫的「沙漠中的夏甲與伊實瑪爾」而跑回到巴比松鄉下去時，他就公開的對舊的美的概念提出一個猛烈的抗議，雖然他在當時是被駡作「醜陋的描繪者」，在我們中國的舊小説中，我們也能找到這種例子，如水滸傳中，作者把李逵和魯智深寫成最出色的人物，而他們的特徵就在他們具有這種粗獷的美，所以使十七世紀的中國批評家金聖嘆也不能不稱這兩個粗獷的人物爲，嫵媚可愛了。</p>
<p>本來，世界上是没有絶對的美的（所謂純粹美），因爲藝術乃是社會意識形態之一種。但是藝術家却應該識他自己歷史時代的任務，而從正確的立塲去觀察社會的生活，從那裏顯示出時代的美來。</p>
<h3>山國戀愛剪影</h3>
<p>— 寒穀</p>
<p>—邊疆風俗特寫—</p>
<p>雨龍在西南的邊省裏，是一個僻塞的小縣。</p>
<p>金沙江漾着曼妙的漣漪，由上游蜿蜒的流下來，江的兩岸，是峭拔峋嶙的高山，一些零散的人家，就分佈在山的半坡上。</p>
<p>山國裏的四季，是帶有野氣的，一山葱鬱的森林，像一排玉的屏風，野花像玩皮的孩子，嘻笑着，跳擺着。綠菌鋪滿了全山，像山中鑲遍了翠玉。羊羣在山坡上躑躅着，太陽光一寸寸的消失在牧童的鞭上，是太陽偏西的時候了，山林染成鮮紅色，金沙江上泛起金波，天上的幾朶白雲，像一堆堆殘破的舊毯子。太陽梭過山村的十牆，天邊鮮紅一片，太陽像從火爐裏拖出來的鉛球，快要下滾來似的，牧羊人「吁！吁！」將羊趕下山，放牛娃兒！唔呿唔呿！「將牛往坡下邀，過路人打着」「阿呼呼喂哘嘚！—嘚」的呼嘯，趕馬人喊聲「底哩！紫騾！」往騾子後　上打一石頭。</p>
<p>雨龍的姑娘們，踏着殘陽，在山坡上割草，穿着藍布衣裳，披着羊皮，繫着圍腰，圍腰半折起來，插在腰上，拖着辮子，或是將辮子繞在頭上，頭上有的纒着白孝，有的戴着大紅頂子的帽子，赤着脚板。</p>
<p>男子打着套頭，穿着白汗衣，白汗衣上套着織貢呢坎肩，寛褲脚的褲子，揙了起來，有的穿着麻草鞋，有的穿着綫草鞋，草鞋頭上一朶紅簪纓。他們牽着一匹馬，或空着手，向山坡走來，見了姑娘，假若是平時所愛慕的（因爲他們都朝不見晚見）。就拉長了嗓子唱：</p>
<p>「我説是嘍！妹子！阿哥有心同你結個兄和妹，莫玩笑，對你説，可惜人熟面不熟。」</p>
<p>姑娘聽見了，直起腰來，看一看對方，假若不願意的話，就接着唱：</p>
<p>「我説是嘍，你家中也有兄和妹，莫玩笑，對你説，何必出外另找人。」</p>
<p>男子聽見了，生氣啦，接着唱：</p>
<p>「我説是嘍，妹子！好希奇彎彎樹，莫玩笑，對你説，比你標緻斫兩棵！」</p>
<p>姑娘聽見了，也生氣啦，接着唱：</p>
<p>「我説是嘍，山中難找標直樹，莫玩笑，對你説，世上没有百歳人。」</p>
<p>男子聽見了，更不肯甘休，於是駡起來了：</p>
<p>「我説是嘍，鴨子不是鵝的伴，莫玩笑，對你説，小妹那合哥的心？」</p>
<p>姑娘聽了，也不肯甘休，接着唱：</p>
<p>「我説是嘍，小小公鷄才學叫，莫玩笑，對你説，母猪爬牆後火撲。」</p>
<p>男的聽了，更狠毒的嗎！</p>
<p>「…………」</p>
<p>女的聽了，也不肯甘休，有時兩方會因此而扭着打起架來。</p>
<p>在姑娘聽了男的第一個曲子以後，假如願意的話，就嬌嫩而温柔的答腔了：</p>
<p>「我説是嘍，蒼天底下都兄妹，莫玩笑，對你説，那怕面熟人不熟。」</p>
<p>男的聽了，説不出的愉快，輕鬆，接着唱：</p>
<p>「我説是嘍，妹子！蜜蜂採花來路遠，莫玩笑，對你説，不看脚歩看路程。」</p>
<p>姑娘聽了，接着唱：</p>
<p>「我説是嘍，鴿子　食鑽脚歩，莫玩笑，對你説，一歩一歩躦攏來。」</p>
<p>於是兩個人一面唱，一面走到一塊了，兩個人坐在山坡上，憧憬着天邊的晚霞，看着天空披着淡紅色的輕紗的飛鳥，山上送來黄栗　的濤聲，和着金沙江的水聲，向東流去。岸邊的柳樹，摇曳在晚風裏，把影子倒在水中，像摇籃般的擺動。兩個人坐在一起，對着本子，哼着山歌，直到黄昏了，冷風吹淡了殘陽，璀燦的晚霞，消失在遠遠的江上，遠山漸漸晦暗，矇朧，江面是一層薄霧，山上的林木在糢糊暮靄裏，摇着黑得發亮的光，兩個講好了一下一次的約會，才難捨難分的離别。</p>
<h3>情談（木刻）</h3>
<p>— M.　Pikov</p>
<h3>墓前</h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>像小山丘一樣，一堆將要枯萎的目的，紅的花朶放在我底面前。我平静地呼吸大地底香味，帶着一切永不忘却的記憶底痕跡。隨後，我在牠旁邊躺下，閉上了眼睛，太陽漸漸從我底眼皮蓋上移去。</p>
<p>我純然静默地安睡在黑暗之中。没有風，没有花，没有了我自己。</p>
<p>地心中龐大的聲音轟響起來。地泉在下面奔流，像千千萬萬的狂人奔向一點小小的火光。我接受了感應，唱起無聲的安息歌來了。在心裏唱着每一個單純的詞句，「願你——安息——」地反覆繼續唱了不知多少遍，緩緩地，笨重地，永遠不能完結。</p>
<p>「安息——在——土地裏……」</p>
<p>嘴唇僵硬，眼淚是一把鐵鉗，冷冰冰地夾住我底太陽穴和生疼的後腦。我不是在唱歌，而是歌中的每一詞句舉起脚跟在重重地蹬搗我底心臟。</p>
<p>「喂，起來呀，你在這里幹什麽！」</p>
<p>打掃夫（剛才我走進門，他向我要那球花，説他會替我用馬口鐵罐把牠插供起來，被我拒絶了的那個人）又走來把我叫醒了，他踢我底腦袋，並在我底伸直的手臂上捺了幾下。他從遠遠的水管那里挑來的兩桶淸水放在路邊。</p>
<p>我用手掌在他底桶裏舀點水來淋灑底菖蘭花的時候，他又不同意地説：「没用的，水——怎麽行呢？太陽一曬風一吹就要發軟的呀。」</p>
<p>但是我還决心要在墳前挖一個深洞把我底花來種在裏面。我用手指，枯枝和瓦片挖了，泥土又濕又堅實，很不容易挖成圓柱形，够把我底花穩穩地種下洞穴。</p>
<p>「你不能在這里挖洞！」打掃夫又干涉我了。</p>
<p>「爲什麽不能够呢？地不是種花的嗎？」</p>
<p>「我不許你！」這回他很嚴厲地噴出口沫。</p>
<p>「我偏要挖！」</p>
<p>他没有别的辦法就挑起水桶走掉了。我聽見他嗯嗯哼哼地這樣説了可笑的謊話：</p>
<p>「你挖吧，你在地上挖了洞——一下雨，水就要漏進墳裏去了……我是爲了好呀！」</p>
<p>四邊没有人也没有飛鳥，我向那偉大的存在——永遠的存在再致送了一次最後的哀肅的敬禮。</p>
<h3>老段</h3>
<p>— 艾</p>
<p>看起來，年青得很，只不過十七八歳的大孩子，但我們一碰在一塊，　了很熟識的原故，還是愛照一般西甯人的稱呼，在他姓上，加個老字，叫他老段。他是替人家燒飯管貨倉的，可是閒了出街玩的時候，老愛穿着套把西裝，或者是單穿白襯衣，配上西裝褲子和皮鞋。第一次會商，我簡直猜不出他是做啥的，只是握着手，覺得他的手板，非常之粗燥，尤其是二指姆和中指姆之間，有着很厚的　疤。像這樣好穿漂亮的工人，在未交一些海員朋友以前，（海員就是頂喜歡穿西裝）我是很詫異的，而且還略微有些不滿，這不是説他不合身份，不該穿，乃是以爲，何必學這些不必要的奢華呢。等到他有一天説他看過我報上做的文章，並從懷里取出一本四角捲邊的書，拿粗笨的指頭點着，要我替他解釋幾個新名詞時，我才將這種不滿的障幕，全行撕掉。這是人和人有了內在的接觸，而且，倘如更加了解便自然會忘形於外表的。</p>
<p>他没有正式讀過書，起先願意認得幾個字，是從和一個同鄉的排字童工住在一起，看見人家同自己一樣的年紀，居然能够看書看報，對大人些談出許多自己不懂的事情。繼後對讀書起了更加强烈的念頭，則是碰見一個流落在仰光，没法兒發展，只在教着私學的青年：由於這人的朝夕指引，幼稚的心胸里，也温熱起了對人類遠景的懷望。先前在廚房里，胡里胡塗地，和油烟煤灰混日子，把人生最好的時光。悄悄地糟踏完掉，本不顧惜，現在，便趁米鍋未開的當兒，取出懷里的書，静静地蹾在爐邊展閲，一得閒，凡是有爲的年青朋友，總想方設法去會會，要想從别人那里取得一些值得學習的東西。據他説，把工錢積攢起來，製備西裝，便是打這個時候開始的。</p>
<p>他的老板，一個陰陰沉沉的中年商人，專門做批發「桔梗」生意的。——關於「桔梗」，我現在還弄不淸，到底是中國人的叫法，還有緬甸話的譯音。我只知道這種原料，製出來，便是我們在信封上，包裹袋上，使用的那種紅色火漆。——自僱用老段這孩子以後，就省去了另一筆人工開消，因爲除叫他燒飯而外，還要他到平常鎖着的貨倉，去經管「桔梗」的出納，督責那些搬運的印度工人。這在老段這孩子，到還並不覺得十分繁難，原因他自幼小時候，就隨着趕馬人，隨着麵店師傅，經過不少的磨練，吃過不少的辛苦。並且，他手足極快當，只要貨倉鎖着的日子，他能够抽出工夫來，做他自己名下的事情——看書，找朋友。老板起初也不高興他常常出街，但因老段這孩子，從前在麵店里跑堂，學得伶牙利齒的，就直向老板講，説他只賣氣力，並不出賣身子，什麽都弄歸一了，又不曾懈怠過一件工作，爲啥子不凖出去，倘要没頭没腦地阻止，就寗肯息工。老板紅着臉搔搔頭皮，隨便説幾句不失身份的支唔話，以後，就睜隻眼閉隻眼地，由他去自由自在的了。</p>
<p>他的老板看見他穿西裝，也是極不滿意的，但不好直搭直説得。有一次，印度的甘地來到仰光，宣傳非武力抗命運動。老板去看了回來，才帶着好意，向老段這孩子説：「你看人家甘地，四海聞名的，還是精光赤裸，只圍一張帕子呀！街上哪個人見了不尊敬？我肯信，一並不在乎講究，啥子皮鞋西裝的。」老段告訴我，他已曉得老板説的話，並不含有壞意，但因看見那種教訓人的討厭神氣噈噈便便地抵塞他，「人家大人物　」就是根絲不掛，卵子擺在外面，也有人去捧住哪！咱個拿來比我們這些人，我們這些人穿起西裝，還要給人足踏哩，他有一次走來，現得很苦惱的樣子，他説：「這一向，吃過晚飯，老板理一理衣衫，就出街去了。老板娘就趕忙叫我足跟足足了出去，看老板到底去了啥子地方。結果，老板走到日本妓女那里去了。我想，憑良心，説真話呢，他們兩口子就會鬧得天翻地覆，打得頭破血流的，而且，老板這樣的傢伙，玩了一個女人又一個女人的，哪里就會因你憑空吵一架，便會變好。比方吃魚的貓兒，咱個離得開腥氣。如果要回來一五一十地告訴她，反而對大家没一點好處，自己呢，説不定還會打破飯碗，因爲老板一惱羞成怒，難道還不怪我麽？我只好説謊了，好落得大家乾净。同時又不老板娘怪我不盡心，只好把她叫我偵探的事情，全行告訴老板，因爲老板回來説的話，和我揑造的，一點也合不攏，那婆娘家的嘴巴，不咒得你血淋血滴麽？你評評，我弄得對嗎？……咳，不管你咱個説，我總覺得像做了一件錯事，心里老是難過，你還不知道，每次叫我尾老板，　都有錢給我哪。</p>
<p>後來，他終於息了工，這不是老板不要他，而是他須要更多的時間，安頓給自己。他找着一個熟識的福建人開咖啡的，一面跟他汗流水滴地春咖啡，一面跟他學習木炭畫像。他想學會畫像之後，他就能够自由地支使自己，不讓别人覇佔了。這以上，是我在仰光的時候知道的。回國後，他也同我通過幾封信，雖然别字連篇，但會意唸來，意思情緒，却也都表達得淸楚楚的。前年一個廣東排字工人阿廣，（這人打算在另一篇文章里講他）在仰光日報上編的椰風週刋，居然也有他用孟醒的筆名，（意指夢醒），寫過好幾篇短簡的速寫，工人本色的實生活，混着雲南施甸地方的民歌土話，是令我感到有味，而且驚異的。去年又接着阿黄的信，説他已逐回故鄉，在雲南擺夷地方，和一個和尚朋友開照像館，自己竟然當着照像師了。接着，又説不知什麽道理，已給土司官封了生意。現在，他在什麽地方呢？這位不住掙扎着的年青的友人。我希望再聽到他的消息時，仍然是一連串的驚異！</p>
<h3>獨唱</h3>
<p>— 覃子豪</p>
<p>觀客寥寥</p>
<p>但是戲幕揭開了</p>
<p>舞臺上立着一個少女</p>
<p>小的像鴿兒一樣</p>
<p>觀衆鷹眼般地射着她的心</p>
<p>因爲她有一副俳優的表情</p>
<p>她正唱着狂想曲</p>
<p>可是伴奏的音樂爲什麽這樣悲哀啊</p>
<p>歌聲没有諧和</p>
<p>伴奏的音樂太使人感到窒息了</p>
<p>他把柔情極力表現動作上</p>
<p>那些淑女們投她以嫉妬的眼光</p>
<p>觀客們像是沉入睡眠狀態</p>
<p>她的歌聲完了</p>
<p>但是臺下没有一絲兒喝采聲</p>
<p>甚至連掌聲也没有啊</p>
<p>太甜蜜的歌曲有太苦的淚</p>
<p>她的青春到了燃燒的瞬間</p>
<p>生活使她的熱情化作冷灰了</p>
<p>冷灰中有她無數熱的淚點</p>
<h3>出走</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>小雨的夜里季候的冬風由窗縫里吹進來窗帘在動。</p>
<p>守着那一盞並不光亮的燈火，趁這難得休憇的日子，我想，該是一個流浪者書寫家書的時候，提了筆，寫點什麽呢？最要緊的當然是生活的狀况，但，一個平凡的遭遇，從那里寫起呢，躊躇，煩悶，我想還是放棄了這報告的企圖吧！</p>
<p>就在沉思的時候，有一個很輕巧的歩子把門推開了，灰色的棉袍淋着雨，雨水由他的頭髮，淋滿了全部的臉上，幾根硬鬍子把他帶上了較高的年歳，眼色，又是多惶恐憂鬱呵！這一年多没有見面的朋友，竟變得這樣的頽喪，真的，假使不是那熟識的面部輪廓給了我不必思索的記號，就簡直能給我其他的錯覺。</p>
<p>坐下來，燈光照射着，淚滴到地上，彷彿有無限的委屈。</p>
<p>他静默着，半天没有説話，讓鐘針擾動的空氣在我們間保持了片時的距離。</p>
<p>「這將成了一個永恒的不能洗刷的公案啊！」他説，憤憤地，「一個弱小的鄉户，站在一個擁有實力的鄉紳面前，爲了——呵，我又能説什麽呢？」……</p>
<p>鄉，不用説，自然是不如從前了，天災，加匪禍，再加高利貸的借押，還有，零碎的抽索，這些，給與鄉户的不是「向榮」，却自向反的住「衰亡」的路上走去，於是，造成了鄉紳的致命打傷，抽索，事實上已不可能，連高利貸的利息也拿不到，在那些人的眼睛里，只有「逼」！他隨便的呷了一口熱茶，走馬樣的事跡在他的腦袋里轉了一下，冷冷地笑了。</p>
<p>大概你還記得西大街的王五吧？那結實的小伙子，不怕太陽晒也不怕風吹，整年的替這家帮工兼做些雜務，人，够老實，輕易也不見他發怒，誰能曉得禍根就種在他那没有圓房的媳婦頭上呢？</p>
<p>那小媳婦是有那麽幾分姿色的，所謂姿色，並不是像都市間的那種妖，而是天然一種真璞的美，於此，引起了炳根的垂涎。你許没有忘記吧？——炳根，就是王五受雇的大佃主家里的兒子，那傢伙，曾經和我動手過兩次，結果，都讓他輕輕地領到些教訓。「吃虧」，他認爲有無上的侮辱，好幾次，他也指使着家丁報還了過往的憤恨，可是，畢竟受苦痛的還是他，除非他不出來，仇恨在我們當中是種得很深了。</p>
<p>爲了壓廹，爲了恐嚇，一個没有成年的弱女子，又怎能抵抗這强暴的施與呢？終於，只好説是終於了，秋風吹過了鄉野的一晚，密茂的小樹叢映掩着，成了一個絶好的屏幛，秋蟲震憾着整個的大地，月華抹上了樹梢的一角，静，静穆的夜里，誰又知道小樹叢的背後，正有着不平安的空氣呵！</p>
<p>亡後，這事情很快的被發覺了，還用説，除了小媳婦的體刑外，目光，全部的惱恨，集中在主動人的身上了。</p>
<p>他的臉沉下來，把小樓上的空氣弄得更嚴肅了。</p>
<p>日子，是快的，半個月在平静的風波里過去了。説起來，秋天帶給人的是煩悶的孤寂，在我住的那個後山上，一交到夜里，更顯得寂寞的可怕。後山，的確是怕人的，在白天，除了幾個野孩子拾取那没人領管的荒草枯枝以外，一交到黄昏，這里便斷絶了人跡，好事的人們就説什麽有見有鬼火的出現。那一個暴風雨的夜里，聽到了呻吟的呼喊，冒着風雨，拿了風燈，衝出去，想不到，無論如何也想不到，躺在地上的竟是炳根呵！滾着，不成個樣子，最後，他的嘴張了幾下，好像有無限的懺悔，完了，呻吟低了下去，聽不見了。</p>
<p>第二天，傳出了風聲，説是基於平日的什麽什麽，「嫌疑」，也將要受累啊！</p>
<p>他的臉青得可怕，簡直的不敢向他正視一眼，最後，他犯那僅剩的一點熱茶吞下去，怱怱地離開了坐位，和我握了一下手，多冷的掌心呐！——生冷的異鄉，以後，將作我漂流的對象了。他説着，走下了樓，弄堂的牆掩没了他的身影，一陣細雨射過來，也許在象徵着他的運命吧！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>“中國如日之東昇”</h3>
<p>— 映純</p>
<p>據十五日報載：“前任駐南京總領事須磨，自返東京後，曾迭次應各機關團體之邀請，發表關於中日問題之講演；此間各界，僉以須磨駐華已十有一載，且曾參加各種重要談判，故對須磨之觀察，莫不視為重要。須磨曾在日日新聞東亞調查講演“南京政體之現狀及中日關係之前途”，對中國統一之日見鞏固，及中國軍隊軍紀之增高，讚揚不已；并謂中國之統一，係由於“廣東精神”，按此種名詞殊新頴。須磨於結論時，曾引證某某外國人士所言：“日本如日之西落，中國如日之東昇，”一語警告𦗟眾，此後當嚴重注視中日之關係云。</p>
<p>須磨在日本駐華的外交官之中，地位似乎不為不高，而其經手交涉的案子，也似乎不算得少。所以他發言的愼重—應有些分寸，自然是我們的意料之中的。這次他在東京，居然對中國説起些好話來，這自然更不算是奇突的事。善於詞令的人，往往總是滿面笑容的，何况他是個外交官？然而中國本來就有句俗話，呌做“笑裏藏刀”，大意是説笑面也不一定懷好意的。我們當然不能説須磨就是這一類人，原因也是怕無意中輕侮了我們“友邦”的使節。</p>
<p>不過近年來我們之失地千里，“折衝”於威迫利誘之間的，卻又往往是這些使節。我們固然是深願與“友邦親善”者，但是竟又奈何“親善”不得！死一日僑，立刻就有北海案，成都案，漢口案之出現，不特使我們當地的民眾為之不安，也使我國政府在外交上頓時感到棘手。掀然大波，無時或已。—自然，這也無非因為他們曉得了我們的弱點，所以佔了很大的便宜。兵家有言：知己知彼，百戰百勝，“他們可謂是深悉我們的內情者。偵騎𣺏佈了我國內地，言之也是不勝使人寒慄的。</p>
<p>這次須磨的講演，不能不説是深知我國之情的一種反映。我國之統一，於他們自然是不利的。所謂“日本如日之西落，中國如日之東昇，”其實并不是“嘉言“，他不過用以“警告”日本聽衆，使他們“嚴重注視中日之關係”而已。記得不久之前，代土肥杘做特務機關長的松室少將，也曾在一份情報”丙説及中國的政情，説得頭頭是道。須磨與松室，似乎相差也不會很遠的。他們説中國是統一了。這統一是“廣東精神”所促成的。“廣東精神”是什麼？我們且不必深究，但是他們是在希望這種“精神”不能持續，倒是無疑的。三中全會是我國統一和復興的一個徵象，我們希望在這次全會中具體决定我們救亡的方策與前途。那末，我們才真的會“如日之東昇”，走上勵精圖治的康荘大道。</p>
<h3>恭喜發財</h3>
<p>— 如意</p>
<p>新春的時候，親友遇見面，差不多都要説“恭喜發財”這一句話。</p>
<p>發財是可喜的事，然而决不是口頭上説“發財”，就能夠發財的；俗話有云：“身發財發”，可知身體康健，實在是發財先决的條件。</p>
<p>要想身體康健，還要調服滋補的藥品，例如血壓者應該調服補血的藥，肺弱者應該調服魚訐油等；而在補血藥中，當然以“自來血”效力最確。在魚肝油中，當然以“五洲乳白魚肝油”和“地球牌麥精魚肝油”滋養最富。及時選服，定能使身體康強，精神健旺，造成黃金的事業。</p>
<h3>她的妝台上</h3>
<p>— 衆香</p>
<p>愚園路上有一座精級的住宅，這住宅的主人是某女士，因為主人是愛好雅潔的，所以屋子裏收拾得特別淸爽，尤其是她所住的臥室，佈置淸幽，一座梳妝台上，陳列着幾種化裝品，瓶樣和裝璜都是十分美麗。</p>
<p>這座梳妝台上陳列的化裝品是一瓶“一三一頭水”，一瓶“三三香水”，一瓶“一品香雪花”，一瓶“星球牌香蜜”，原來這些都是五洲藥房的出品，有三種特點，就是質料好，氣味香，售價廉，像這樣高尚的國貨，陳列在高尚仕女的妝台上，是再適合不過的呢。</p>
<h3>蓋色湖畔</h3>
<p>— 張海</p>
<p>整夜被兇猛的犬吠聲擾亂着，我們這些身子浸透了疲乏的人，不能安靜的熟睡。天剛放亮，蒙古包外面又沸騰着奇異噪雜的聲音，讓人聽着不自在，尤其是那喑啞的牛聲和羊的悲嘷混合在一塊，直戳人耳朶。平原像個煩惱的人，一點都不能甯靜下來。我們的主人，那個四十上下歲的忠厚的教人，他在一黝暗的屋子裏摸索，嘴上的烟袋，閃出微紅的燄光。他在佛榷前跪下，默唸着禱辭。一歇兒工夫，他就在包外吹着號角，驅着牲口羣往草塲上去放牧了。</p>
<p>女主人蹲在爐邊生火,馬舊在燃燒裏發出臭味，她忙亂着，在包裏轉來轉去，彷彿她的腦子有毛病,她不知應該用什麼吃喝來招待我們。同行者布里雅特蒙古人巴蘇拉，用喀尔喀話同她講，我們自己帶着食糧，也會做，所以不要攪擾她。可是她不肯，她幾乎生氣了，她説：“你們瞧不起我們嗎？我們最喜歡客人！你們又是遠道來的，輕易不來我們這兒，不吃我們點東西怎麼行呀！”不能不吃她的早餐了。</p>
<p>吃過飯我們就想走，駝夫已經催過兩三次了，他説若不早早動身今晚上恐怕不能到“班塔，”因為“坎林特”地方找不到水井，非到“班塔”去宿不可。可是女主人不願我們馬上就走，她要帶我們去看“蓋色湖。”</p>
<p>我們四個人由女主人領着，到西邊一個牲口欄裏，每人都弄到一匹馬騎着，一會兒我們便踏上一條大道。</p>
<p>“這大道是去年才修好的，××人出的主意，喇嘛跟王公逼我們百姓修築。説良心話，大道我們百姓誰也不常走，倒是××人的汽車不斷在這大道上跑來跑去。”</p>
<p>原野上散漫着陽光，牲口羣在草地上蠕動，馬歡腾的嗷嗷呌。從晨起到現在沒開口的伊凡諾維支沉在回憶中似的哼着“伏爾加”民歌。他把他騎的馬勒在一邊，故意要離我們還一點。這個同行者往往如此，他不喜歡向別人一起走一起逛。在哈爾濱時朋友們都呌他“孤獨的黑熊。”</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>“蓋色湖”並非是像“西湖”那樣優美，其實是一個小水湾，堤上有幾株紅棗樹，蘆葦長得很矮。我失望了！簡直可以説是受了女主人的當！她從我們的臉色上知道了我們的意思，她親熱的説：</p>
<p>“湖，實實在在是沒什麼看頭　我也不是要諸位來看湖景，我是要告訴諸位一件事。”</p>
<p>她引我們走上湖邊的大平原，這兒有廣場，修得平平坦坦。</p>
<p>“看見了嗎！這是操塲，××人逼着×王呌我們修好。×王再到處挑年靑的男子來當兵，有的是自己願跟去當兵，×王每人發給他們一枝槍教他們怎麼放槍，怎麼打仗。天天，早起傍晚都有大隊人馬在這場子上練習打仗。有一天不知什麼地方來了十個騎馬的人，路過這裏，便給××抓住了！據説他們是布里雅特共和國派來的奸細。不問靑紅皂白就把那十個人帮起來，再把火油倒在他們的頭髮上，然後用火點着，兩個兵抬看一個，在頭髮燒得正烈時，猛力把人丟進湖里。這樣把十個不明來歷的人，全活活地投進湖水中淹死了！現今我們“沙爾沙”地方的年靑男人全運走了！聽説運到綏遠去打仗！哦！你們不是也要到綏遠去嗎？可是在“沙爾沙”那裏你們千萬別説你們是到綏遠去的，要是給喇嘛和王公知道，你們就沒命啦！”</p>
<p>我們四個同行者不約而同的跳下馬來，深深地向女主人鞠躬，表示我們萬分的感激她。</p>
<p>離開沙爾沙“已經是將近正午了。我隄防着前面的路程。</p>
<h3>環球航空旅行紀(上)</h3>
<p>— 美國法爾考納博士著特譯</p>
<p>我平生供職美國民政，直到一九三一年，方才告退。從此以後，便以旅行消磨歲月，前後曾四次週游世界，本年決計再由天空週游一次。我家住台克柴斯州，我最初打算由達拉斯飛到米亞米，乘汎美航空公司的飛機飛到巴西京城，然後改乘大齊泊林號飛船飛到德國，此後乘帝國航空公司法蘭西航空公司或王家荷蘭航空公司的飛機而到東方，然後再乘汎美航空公司的飛剪號回到美國。</p>
<p>正要買票的當兒，看見報上載着德國新飛船興登堡號將在五月間開始飛渡大西洋，從德國佛蘭克福特出發，在美國紐傑賽州萊克赫斯特終止。於是我便改變計𤲯，而在五月八日由達拉斯飛到紐傑賽州紐華克，計程一四零二哩，費時十點半鐘。</p>
<p>自五月十一日起，至十四日止，我乘了興登堡號，由萊克赫斯特飛到佛蘭克福，計程四五○○哩，費時四十九點零三分鐘。興登堡號是一隻很大的飛船，有二十五個房間，每間容客兩人，裏面有兩個睡位，和冷熱水龍頭。船中有大餐室，書寫室，打牌室，飲酒室，沐浴室，和散步的甲板。船中的椅子和用具，都是鋁質所製，分量很輕。船的每面，裝有高約三呎闊約五十呎的玻璃長窗，旅客在飛行時可從窗中下望陸地和海洋。</p>
<p>尋常飛機飛行的高度，平均約距地兩哩，興登堡號飛船却只距地七百呎，所以當它飛過紐約城時，我們在船中可以看淸街鐘的兩針。它所以飛得這樣低的主要原因，是因為在這種高度的空氣，比更上的空然濃厚，因此可少用養氣支持天空中的飛船。這次飛行共有乘客五十一人。由萊克赫斯特到佛蘭克福的票費，連餐品和小賬在內，只美金四百元。最近該船又添了十二個房間，共能載客七十二人。由萊克赫斯特到佛蘭克福，全程長四五○○哩，途中並不停留。出發之初，飛過紐約城等地，進了歐洲，飛過愛爾蘭，蘇格蘭，和德國北部，一路很有興趣。</p>
<p>飛艙的指揮，是艾克納博士，承他的情，曾跟我談話。據他説，他以為齊泊林飛船日後定成飛渡大西洋的普用之物，德國不久將開造興登堡號姊妹船三艘，於是來往佛蘭克福和紐約間的齊泊林飛船隊，共有四艘之多。他又説，大齊泊林號已來往歐洲和南美間百餘次，載客約近三萬人，並無一人喪失生命，</p>

<p>或曾受傷云，佛蘭克福城市長克尼白斯博士這次也乘興登堡號往返，他回到本城後，便在古事政廳舉行一個招待會，自上午十一時起，至下午二時才散。本城許多有名市民，也參加這個盛會。散會時他贈每客一個藍地上印銀色興登堡號肖影的徽章，和一張羊皮紙印成的證書，證明興登堡號第一次由萊克赫斯特飛到佛蘭克福時，曾為乘客之一。</p>
<h3>光明</h3>
<p>— 李勵文</p>
<p>學校裏為了節電，自己為了節錢，就讓自己在黑暗裏過了一個寒假。</p>
<p>每天，天開始黑下來的時候，自己的恐怖就到了……</p>
<p>自己的膽子本來不算大，加以腦子裏像每一個中國人一樣裝滿了各種離奇荒誕的神鬼故事，黑夜裏孤零零躺在房子裏，於是，不由的心裏一陣戰慄，怕起來了。……在黑夜裏，原就是各種魑魅䰣魎的世界，心裏越怕，就像眞的有什麼在黑暗裏哭泣，在黑暗裏冷笑，甚至於伸出冰冷的手來似的，背脊骨裏一冷，把頭往被窩裏一縮，一夜睡不着，巴望窗外快亮，巴望第一遍雞鳴快到。……</p>
<p>從此，我更深一層知道光明為什麼可愛的了？</p>
<p>“牠們為什麼這樣笨的，”小時候自己常常這樣想，而今，我知道那些可憐的飛蛾為什麼情願死在火裏的原因了。</p>

<p>電影</p>
<h3>關於「夜半歌聲」</h3>
<p>「夜半歌聲」是馬徐維邦編導的一部緊張恐怖鉅片，從攝製到現在，費時足有八個月，在工作的期間，馬徐維邦且因之吐過幾次血，可見他對於這部片子的重視和盡心。</p>
<p>曾經有許多人幹過恐怖片，但結果終没有攝成，不肯下决心，當然是原因之一，其實，根本還在於物質條件的限制，新華公司出品，一向以精細完善著稱，「夜半歌聲」在技術條件充分的完備下，收穫的美滿，一定會使你感到驚奇。</p>
<p>在演出上，「夜半歌聲」始終是沉浸在恐怖的氣氛裏，極盡光怪陸離之至，但他的故事，却是非常現實，而且針對着這個不合理的社會的。</p>
<p>演員的雄壯，也是值得一提的，金山化裝一面目猙獰的怪人，不僅是逼肖而已，尤其是內心的表演，一定會喚起同情之鳴。胡萍的大家閨秀，施超的英俊青年，周文珠的龍鍾老嫗，顧夢鶴的紈袴子弟，許曼麗的少女，王爲一的怪老頭子，都各盡所能，臻於化境。</p>
<h3>寳貝白玲又一偉構大上海映「虹影花聲」</h3>
<p>「梨園思子」中之九齡神童寳貝白玲，今日起又在大上海大戲院與觀衆相見，片名「虹影花聲」。寳貝白玲飾一伶仃之孤兒，街頭賣花，淸歌一曲。寳貝白玲的天才歌喉，在「梨園思子」一片中，已給觀衆極深的印象，大明星埃第康德曾禮聘他在無綫電台中合作播音，並且稱他爲銀幕和舞台上人格最偉大之一人。本片中寳貝白玲極盡其所長，其歌七八次之多。內中有古舊的民間曲，莊嚴的聖曲，活潑的黑人名曲等。最動聽者當推「銀河虹影曲」，旋律的宛轉，一聲聲打動人的心絃。助演者尚有老婦人明星梅勞勃遜，及幽默大師却爾司勃脱華司等云。</p>
<h3>「我們的兒童劇社第一次徵求社員續訊」</h3>
<p>本埠北四川路海寗路口新中央大戲院內「我們的兒童劇社」，是中國唯一的永久性的兒童劇社，而且是兒童們用自身的力量組織起來的團體。他們在去年聖誕節演出「野孩子們」之後，就籌備第一次公演一幕兒童劇「愛的教育」，排練了一個多月，而且把他們的糖菓車錢節省下來，籌集了一筆錢，但因爲在南市閘北等區接洽不着劇塲，故將劇本呈租界審查，想在某大戲院演出。現在，他們已開始第一次徵求社員，預備在公演前擴大組織，先召開成立大會，請求各界給他們一點指導和一點帮助。自各報刋載他們徵求社員的消息後，去信討章程的很多，有幾封信是小朋友們結伴合寫的，可見本埠兒童對於戲劇，十分愛好。兒童戲劇運動是值得我們注意和帮助的，聽説「野孩子們」的作者穆褉也寫信給他們，願意指導他們，也是值得我們快樂的事。這幾天，新中央戲院的賣票處，常有小朋友們訊問該社，預備去參加。但性急的小朋友們在下午三點鐘之前跑去，總空跑了一趟，没有見到該社的辦事人員。因爲該社的辦事人都在讀書，或是做練習生學徒的，每天要在下午三點鐘後才能到社裏，故請已去或想去的小朋友們以後不要去得太早。最後，要告訴大家一個好消息，該社最近的工作是試騐「影子戲」；而本星期日下午三時，他們要開一個茶話會，還有歌唱等餘興，他們也歡迎愛好戲劇的小朋友們前往參加云。</p>
<h3>巴黎映「精忠報國」</h3>
<p>「精忠報國」一片，爲一九三六年十大巨片之一，確係戰事片中之翹楚，啟示愛國思想，描寫戰地生活，即以該片主演者而論，有茀特立馬區，華納裴士德，里昻巴里摩亞三巨星之通力合演，更屬名貴。此片所至，無不擁擠。巴黎趁此新春伊始，繼「雷夢娜」「絶島寃痕」後作鉅片川流不息之貢獻。下期接連開映者，已排定埃第康泰之「桃李花開」云。</p>
<h3>藝華春訊</h3>
<p>潘孑農手編之「神秘之花」導演岳楓於昨日召集劇中男女主角，如白楊，王乃東，馬陋芬，姜脩，關宏達，梁篤生等及全體工作人員在編劇部演講劇情，岳楓對於「神秘之花」全劇的處理，將有一番新的姿態供獻於銀壇。</p>
<p>陳鏗然之「彈性女兒」已完成十之九，尚有幾個重要外景鏡頭，日內須趕拍完竣，預料「彈性女兒」公映時期，當在春光明媚中，與全滬仕女相見。</p>
<p>徐蘇靈之「海天情侣」開拍以來，已完成十之八，劇中有海輪出事，王引遇險的一段戲，擬在福州海面實地攝取，須待春暖融融開始時，徐當率領大隊人馬，前往攝製。</p>
<p>「並蒂蓮」係南國仙子紫羅蘭，與名小生吳楚帆共同合作的傑構，劇情以戀愛爲主題，描寫青年男女贊成自由結合，反對封建色彩的舊式婚姻，刻劃入微，該劇開拍迄今，將告完成矣。</p>
<p>黄喜謨編劇之「三星伴月」，運用輕鬆筆法，描寫以提倡中國工商事業，表揚民生主義爲中心的一個題材，深具現實性的一部佳作，並有偉大歌舞塲面，熱烈穿插，該劇由方沛霖担任導演，將與「神秘之花」同時進行攝製。</p>
<p>藝華公司上半年度的新陣綫，除現在公映之「化身姑娘續集」與「滿園春色」外，其餘如「彈性女兒」，「並蒂蓮」，「海天情侣」，「神秘之花」，「三星伴月」，「女財神」等六部鉅片，均須次第完成，陸續映演。</p>

<h3>Japanese Residents in Tianjin Request Reduction of Troops in North China</h3>

<h3>The Situation of the Balearic Islands</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chu Yukun</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>For centuries, the Balearic Islands have occupied an important strategic position in the Mediterranean Sea, and recently, due to Italy's conquest of Abyssinia and the civil war in Spain, the balance of power in the Mediterranean has changed, and this has once again become a focus of global attention.</p>
<p>The Balearic Islands (Balearic Islands for short—translator) are of no economic importance. The area is only 2,000 square miles, the population is only 350,000, and there are no precious mineral fruits and vegetables. Although they are considered abundant and welcomed by Britain and Germany, it is definitely not worth using war to seize the Balearic Islands. However, they are of international importance because the military ports of the Balearic Islands are scattered between France and its North Africa, and on the sea route of the British Empire from Gibraltar through Malta Suez to India.</p>
<p>The easternmost part of the Balearic Islands, Minorca, was first occupied by Britain in the 18th century. Britain's reason for seizing Minorca was entirely due to strategic relations. The main city of Minorca is Port Mahon, an impregnable good harbor that is easy to defend and difficult to attack. Britain's loss of the port in 1803 was not a major loss for Britain itself, because Britain had occupied a better port, Malta, in 1799, and developed it as Britain's base in the eastern Mediterranean. Apart from Minorca once being owned by Britain, the Balearic Islands initially belonged to the rule of Aragon after expelling the Moors from the Middle Ages, and later became part of Spain. When the leaders of the separatist movement were active in Barcelona, they tried to unite the Balearic Islands to form a "Greater Catalonia." Although most of the people of the Balearic Islands speak the Catalan language, when the Spanish Republican government allowed Catalonia to become an autonomous government, it did not include the Balearic Islands in Catalonia.</p>
<p>Since the Balearic Islands lie in the center of the traffic route between France and its North African colonies, the French government has tried its best to maintain friendly relations with the Spanish government, and the main reason is this. For the same reason, in order to protect the safety of the route to India, Britain has always opposed Spain's cession of the Balearic Islands to a third country. It is also generally believed that when the last world war broke out, London had concluded an agreement with Madrid, so the British navy could borrow Port Mahon as its naval base. If Italy participated in the war in the Central European Group, Paris was once alarmed by unofficial news a few years ago, saying that Spain's Primo de Rivera had allowed Mussolini to borrow the Balearic Islands as its base in certain emergency situations; only after the establishment of the Spanish Republican government in 1931, this agreement ended without any result. The Spanish government authorities, in view of the strategic importance of the Balearic Islands, have also made great efforts in recent years to enhance their defense projects. Gil Robles, the Minister of Military Affairs in 1935, who is one of the leaders of the Spanish rebels today, cannot be said to have not worked hard in the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>The sudden rise of Fascist Italy and its complete reliance on its special rights in the Balearic Islands have made it one of the world's naval powers. Britain has suffered enough humiliation from Mussolini, who unscrupulously attacked East Africa, and in fact, Britain no longer considers the route to India to be safe. Similarly, if Italy has really obtained the right to use the island as a base for its naval and air forces, it has become a risky act for France to freely obtain grain and manpower supplies from its North African colonies.</p>
<p>Under the current situation, the western Mediterranean is almost completely controlled by the Italian air force based in La Spezia and La Maddalena. If Italy obtains a base in the Balearic Islands, France will have to use the circuitous Atlantic route as its traffic route for its North and South African territories. Therefore, once a Fascist government is established in Spain, no matter whether Italy illegally occupies the Balearic Islands or not, if Fascist Spain allows Fascist Italy to borrow Port Mahon, Palma, and its islands in the event of a war between Italy and France, it will be the most dangerous thing for France. In other words, Italian Volonteers are being sent to Spain, and according to Eden's report in the House of Commons on November 30, it seems that they have unofficially occupied the Balearic Islands. Although it is unofficial, its effect is the same.</p>
<p>The responsible leaders of the Spanish rebel government have repeatedly denied rumors that they have allowed the Balearic Islands to be ceded to Italy or other countries. From the perspective of the Spanish people's love of national glory—which was not broken by Napoleon—it is questionable whether there will be a political system that would disregard everything and cede the national legacy to others. Therefore, at most, they can only allow the great powers to purchase the necessary army, navy, and air force privileges when necessary in wartime.</p>

<h3>The Significance and Impact of the British Defense White Paper</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>In a world shrouded in the clouds of war, with great powers frantically expanding their armaments, the British Cabinet has published a White Paper outlining an ambitious defense plan to be completed within five years. This is certainly not accidental. Since the Labour Party Cabinet fell in 1931 and the Conservative Party regained power, Britain has been caught in a whirlwind of arms competition. The Italo-Abyssinian War broke out the year before last, and the British Conservative Cabinet felt even more compelled to expand its armaments, announcing an expansion plan in March of last year. However, this plan was not implemented for long before Germany abandoned the Locarno Treaties, marched into the Rhineland, and extended the term of military service. Meanwhile, the United States and Japan, after the expiration of the Washington and London Naval Treaties, were also intensifying their defenses in the Pacific. Under these circumstances, Britain had no choice but to strengthen its expansion plan. The publication of this Defense Plan White Paper signals to the world that Britain is determined not to lag behind in the international arms race.</p>
<p>The stated purpose of this expansion, according to Conservative Party members, is to maintain world peace. The White Paper states, "The territories of Great Britain are widely distributed, and the supplies needed by the country from overseas must be transported by sea. All of this underscores the need to emphasize the British military. The Navy must maintain the safety of transportation, and its responsibility is particularly important. The modernization of the defenses of militarily important locations in the British Empire is also one of the most important aspects of the defense plan." This further demonstrates Britain's determination to safeguard the interests of its colonies scattered around the world. However, everyone knows that an arms race can easily lead to war. Whether Britain can stop this dangerous trend is a big question.</p>
<p>According to the White Paper, the cost of Britain's military expansion within five years is estimated to be £150 million. The burden of this huge expenditure will undoubtedly fall on the broad masses of British taxpayers. Therefore, when this plan was discussed in the House of Commons, Labour Party members strongly opposed it, arguing that it would only increase the burden on the people and was not timely. Under the current circumstances, although this plan is likely to be passed in the House of Commons with the support of Conservative Party members, it will probably be difficult to win the sincere support of the majority of the public.</p>
<p>Moreover, military expansion is contagious. The military expansion of country A will lead to the military expansion of country B, and the military expansion of country B will lead to the military expansion of country C. The withdrawal of troops from countries B and C will in turn lead to the re-withdrawal of troops from country A. The current British troop withdrawal can be said to be the result of troop withdrawals by other countries to some extent, but this will in turn lead to further troop withdrawals by other countries. Now that the British Defense Plan White Paper has just been published, Germany has put forward demands for the same rights, the Japanese Navy is also preparing to catch up quickly, and Italy is rumored to be proposing a large-scale defense plan at the Supreme Fascist Council to be held on March 1. In this way, as the armaments of the great powers expand in a cause-and-effect manner, the world's most terrible disasters are sure to come.</p>
<h3>British Naval Expansion, the United States Not Willing to Fall Behind</h3>
<p>Believing that British and American forces do not conflict, hoping that Britain will increase its strength in the Pacific</p>
<p>[Washington] After learning that Britain plans to start building three battleships, two aircraft carriers, and several cruisers on April 1, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Leahy told reporters today that if other countries increase their naval strength beyond the limits of existing treaties, the United States may follow suit. However, he also solemnly stated that he is not qualified to express opinions on Britain's plan on behalf of the State Department or the Navy Department; he only knows that the policy of the United States is never to allow the United States Navy to be inferior to that of any country. At the same time, other naval officers generally believe that a strong British Navy is a stabilizing force, especially in the Pacific. Some even believe that the United States welcomes Britain's increase in military power in the Pacific. Admiral Leahy also said that maintaining equal strength between the United States and Britain is only a matter of policy and should not be regarded as a sign of any conflict between Britain and the United States.

<p>[Washington] The British government announced its National Defense Program White Paper yesterday, which includes a naval shipbuilding plan. It is learned that the US government does not intend to order another naval shipbuilding plan to compete with Britain, because the government believes that the funds listed in the US naval budget for 1937 are sufficient to modernize the navy, and there is also a shortage of steel needed for shipbuilding.

<h3>British Sea Phase Explains Shipbuilding in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Participates in Submarine Convention</p>
<p>[London] Secretary of the Sea Hall replied to questions in the House of Commons today, saying that the number of cruisers with eight-inch caliber artillery positions that have been built and are being built by the great powers is as follows: Britain 15 ships, the United States 18 ships, Japan 12 ships, France and Italy 7 ships each, and Germany 3 ships. Hall also said that he would like to take this opportunity to state that the recent report that British cruisers of this type have lost their dominant position is not credible. (Central News Agency, London, Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>[London] The naval treaty signed by Britain, France, and the United States on March 25 of last year has a protocol on the humanization of submarine warfare. This protocol was signed by Britain, France, the United States, Italy, Germany, Japan, and other countries on November 6 of last year. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky recently sent a note to British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Vansittart, stating that the Soviet government is also willing to sign and join this protocol. According to the protocol on the humanization of submarine warfare, its provisions are the same as those contained in the Washington Naval Treaty, stating that in wartime, submarines must first place all crew members and passengers of any merchant ship in a safe zone before sinking or damaging them.

<h3>US Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>Amendments to the Proposal</p>
<p>[Washington] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Senator Pittman, has temporarily revised the permanent neutrality bill he proposed. The bill stipulates: ㊀ Prohibit lending money or supplying arms to warring factions in international wars or civil wars; ㊁ Other goods cannot be exported until ownership has been transferred from Americans to foreign buyers; ㊂ US merchant ships must not be armed, and US citizens must not travel on ships of belligerent nations. All provisions will automatically take effect when the president declares that a state of war exists, authorizing the president to prohibit US ships from carrying any goods that could endanger the peace of the United States at will.

<h3>England Expands Military Preparedness to Safeguard World Peace</h3>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Explains the Purpose to Parliament; Labor and Liberal Parties Express Criticism</p>
<p>[London] Yesterday in Parliament, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain vigorously defended the government's proposed £400 million national defense loan, responding to criticism from the Labor and Liberal parties. Chamberlain declared that the purpose of this loan was to maintain peace. The British Empire's efforts towards peace, and its determination not to use force for aggression, were understandable to all. Moreover, Britain's efforts to maintain peace were not only for itself but also for all nations of the world. The British government, based on past experience, deeply understood that Britain's power and its military strength were closely related. Therefore, today's British military strength, being constantly improved, was a factor in stabilizing the international political situation and a mainstay of world peace.</p>
<p>Parliamentary debate, which began after Chamberlain proposed the national defense loan, was to conclude today. The first to voice dissent against the government's plan to spend £1.5 billion on defense over five years was Lawrence, a former Secretary to the Treasury in the Upper House Cabinet. Lawrence criticized the key points of the White Paper, arguing that there was no well-considered connection between the government's defense plan and its foreign policy, especially its foreign policy related to the ideal of collective security. Furthermore, the defense plan proposed in the White Paper did not demonstrate any real adjustment measures, and there was a lack of conceptual or formal consideration of effective defense measures in important military matters. Lawrence declared that the Labor Party opposed the resolution because it sought to impose this huge burden on the entire population not through appropriate taxation but through borrowing, which would inflate prices and make it most difficult for those least able to bear it.</p>
<p>Liberal Party member Sir Sinclair spoke next, stating that the Liberal Party was closely scrutinizing the budget. However, it would support the military preparations necessary for defense and peace. He stated that although the military buildup of certain European countries carried a moral responsibility, in his personal opinion, it should be borne by the victorious nations of the post-World War I policies. However, Britain truly felt compelled and had no other path to follow. Nevertheless, Sinclair considered the borrowing plan to be economically unwise in the current environment of commercial recovery, and he questioned whether it was possible to prevent unscrupulous profiteering.</p>
<p>When Chamberlain proposed the national defense loan, Labor Party member Attlee called it an unprecedented move during peacetime. Chamberlain responded that this was due to the current era, which had entered an unprecedented situation, forcing Britain to spend huge amounts on military expenses in a short period. Furthermore, the cost of military preparedness today had skyrocketed compared to after the World War. Every country felt the unreliability of the prospect of peace and was pouring all its efforts into increasing its offensive capabilities. As a result, the invention of new weapons, new transport, and new equipment was constantly evolving. However, as the spear becomes sharper, so does the shield become stronger. The cost of offensive and defensive equipment cannot be determined. However, because of the weight of its responsibilities and the number of its vulnerabilities, Britain could not neglect preparations for both offense and defense. Both domestically and on all lines of communication, it should use the latest equipment to resist attacks from others and must possess a strong military force that could be dispatched to any location at any time. Chamberlain stated that the White Paper published on Tuesday detailed the uses and applications of defense spending. Details of the usage would be available in the budget estimates of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Furthermore, the White Paper stated that the total defense expenditure over five years would reach £1.5 billion, but this was not a fixed number. If the situation changed and expenses could be reduced, the government would do its best to reduce them. However, since the military buildup of various countries began, the international situation had become unfavorable to Britain. If this continued, the current £1.5 billion would likely be felt to be insufficient.</p>
<p>Labor Party member Henderson then asked whether Britain would defend itself alone or be part of a collective security system. Chamberlain replied that for the public good, he could not ideally specify who was an enemy and who was a friend. The British government's plan was not directed against any one country or any one group of countries, but the government, for the sake of national security and to fulfill its responsibilities, had to present the necessary plan to Parliament. Chamberlain further pointed out that, according to the White Paper's projections, the additional annual tax revenue would be £32 million, and this did not include the amount to be borrowed. However, if Parliament did not grant the government the power to borrow, the additional national defense expenditure to be increased through taxes would be £112 million per year. In his view, such a huge tax burden would likely cause the nascent commercial recovery to suffer a setback and collapse. Chamberlain further explained that since taxpayers had already shouldered three-quarters of the total national defense expenditure, the increase in additional public debt was not excessive.</p>
<p>Chamberlain then discussed the method of borrowing, saying that the Treasury should have the power to raise funds in a way that was appropriate to the current situation and economical. The 3% interest rate and 30-year repayment method were merely accounting procedures and had no necessary connection to the Treasury's method of issuing bonds. The Treasury could issue bonds, treasury bills, or other types of bonds, with or without reserves. Chamberlain further pointed out that Attlee considered this method to be an error of wartime measures, but this method was fundamentally a way to maintain peace. The government's huge plan was necessary to ensure its own safety and maintain the safety of other countries, so it could not avoid its responsibility. As for the increased burden on the people due to military expenditure, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was most aware of its significance and deeply regretted the self-destruction of modern civilization, which did not know how to resolve its disputes through giving and taking, but instead strived for the prosperity and satisfaction of the world's human race. But at this moment, it could only grit its teeth and move forward, as peace, political stability, and disarmament could not be achieved by one country alone. But wherever and whenever Britain could find someone who shared its views, it would surely unite with them and jointly seek a more effective, more rational, and more valuable solution.</p>
<p>Regarding the Labor Party's criticism, Chamberlain further declared that if the Labor Party did not clearly answer whether it opposed the scope of the national defense plan outlined in the White Paper, Chamberlain solemnly stated that all the expenses listed in the White Paper were largely not duplicated. Regarding the self-governing regions, Chamberlain said that Britain had no right to make the self-governing regions bear part of the public expenditure, as the self-governing regions had already spent unlimited amounts of money on their own defense, and had already done their best for the safety of the whole. As for other burden-sharing methods, he knew of no current discussions. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Upper House Discusses Colonial Issues</h3>
<p>[London] At today's meeting of the Upper House, discussing the issue of Germany's demand for the return of its former colonies, Liberal Party member Lord Crewe declared that the division of Germany's colonies among various countries after the European War was a major political mistake. However, since things had already happened this way, it was not convenient to correct them. For now, the solution should be considered from an economic perspective. For example, in some African territories, an open-door system could be established to allow Germany to share the benefits. As for the various arguments Germany used to demand the return of its former colonies, they could not be established. In the past, when Germany had vast colonies, its dissatisfaction was even greater than it is today. At that time, the country was only concerned with having its reputation spread to foreign lands and its national strength reach its peak. Lord Plymouth, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, replied on behalf of the government, refuting the open-door theory, saying that a system of free access to raw materials did not seem to be what Germany was seeking. (17th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Today in the Upper House, Lord Buxton moved to expand the trusteeship system to apply to the colonies. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth replied that any suggestion to change the status of the people of the South African colonies would be met with fierce opposition. Buxton's proposed open-door policy would ultimately fail to grant any colony full financial autonomy, which would be a major obstacle to the development of self-government. In tropical colonies, regardless of which country they belonged to, implementing a trusteeship system and an open-door policy would not only be useless to Germany, where labor standards were relatively high, or any other country. Rather, it would allow countries with relatively low labor standards, especially Japan, to have a monopoly on trade there. As a result, European countries would lose all their possessions. A joint declaration by colonial powers, stating that they would strictly abide by Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant (regarding trusteeship rights), might not reduce the current tension, but it would certainly contribute to a political settlement. Therefore, the British government could not accept Buxton's motion at this time and believed that the Raw Materials Committee meeting to be held soon in Geneva would be able to find a more effective way to solve economic difficulties in its discussions. The matter was then dropped. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>German General Göring Hunts in Poland</h3>
<p>Meets with Military Leaders</p>
<p>Warsaw - Yesterday, German Aviation Minister General Göring hunted in the Biszowice area, killing three wolves. Because there was no snow in the mountains, his enthusiasm for hunting was somewhat diminished. Polish President Mościcki and his wife, Polish Ambassador to Germany Lipski, German Ambassador to Poland Moltke, former Polish Army Chief of Staff General Sosnowski, former Deputy Minister of War General Fabrycy, and Director of External Affairs Count Rommer all participated in the hunt. General Ryz-Śmigły, Chief Inspector of the Armed Forces, was also scheduled to travel there from this evening with the Minister of War and several high-ranking generals to join the hunt.

<h3>Siam Expands Military Preparedness</h3>
<p>Has Purchased Warships and Aircraft from Italy, Japan, and the United States</p>
<p>[Singapore] As military competition among the countries of the world intensifies, Siam is unwilling to lag behind. In addition to ordering new warships from Italy and Japan, it has also ordered several large bombers from the United States, with a total value of US$750,000. The manufacturer is the Martin Company, with a speed of 235 miles per hour. It has also ordered seven torpedo boats from Italy. Now, the Siamese government has dispatched 700 naval personnel on a government yacht to Italy to take delivery. It has been learned that Italy has built a total of nine torpedo boats for the Siamese government, two of which were delivered last year. As for those ordered from Japan, there are two recently built training ships, four submarines, two gunboats, one transport ship, and three coastal defense ships. According to the Siamese government, Siam has a coastline of 1,500 miles, so the navy is the most important part of its national defense plan. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>US High Commissioner to the Philippines</h3>
<p>To Be Succeeded by McNutt</p>
<p>[Washington] Today, President Roosevelt appointed former Indiana Governor McNutt as the United States High Commissioner to the Philippines, succeeding the current Michigan Governor Murphy. McNutt said that he would take office within a month after Senate approval. However, he might not be able to hold this position until the President's term expires. People in the Philippines were quite surprised by McNutt's appointment, as they all thought that the current Acting Commissioner Jones would be officially appointed. After McNutt takes office, there will be many issues to be addressed, the most important of which are the amendment of the economic provisions of the Philippine Independence Act and the United States' future naval presence in the Philippines.

<p>[Washington] Today in the House of Representatives, Representative Crawford, who is familiar with the situation in the Philippines, suggested that the United States recognize Japan's protection of the Philippines after the Philippines becomes fully independent. Crawford also opposed allowing Philippine goods to be imported into the United States and compete with domestic goods, saying that when the United States conducts business negotiations with the Philippines, it should do so with the premise that "Japan will be the future protector of the Philippines," so that when "Japan is determined to advance into the Philippines," the United States will not be unable to maintain its established policy. If the United States retains its army and navy in the Philippines, it will cause international disputes. Furthermore, if the Philippines establishes a reciprocal trade agreement with the United States after independence, how can these preferential conditions not be extended to Japan?

<h3>Japanese Military Attitude Towards Political Parties Becomes More Moderate</h3>
<p>Minister of the Army Awaits Opportunity to Clarify Position; Hope for Cooperation in Administrative Reform</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Since the reopening of the Diet, Minister of the Army Sugiyama has answered questions from the general assembly of the House of Representatives regarding the national defense budget, administrative reform, the military discipline issue, and other questions the Diet has for the military. However, the political parties' understanding of the current situation is somewhat lacking, and they also have some misunderstandings about the military's true intentions. Therefore, Minister of the Army intends to summarize the contents of the questions and the military's views over the past three days, and originally planned to ask the Minister of the Army to take the opportunity to make an active statement at the general assembly on the 18th and frankly express his views. However, he did not get a suitable opportunity on the 18th and did not speak. Therefore, this matter must still wait for an opportunity in the future. (18th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to the Army's observations, during the Hirota Cabinet, political parties failed to understand the extraordinary situation, which led to a great divergence of opinion with the military. However, after the resignation of the previous cabinet, the political parties' understanding of the situation has changed. For example, the speech by the president of the Seiyukai party immediately after the reopening of the Diet and the statement by the secretary-general of the Minseito party were completely consistent with the military's understanding of the situation. However, it is regrettable that the political parties still have questions that promote the separation of the military and the people. Now, the political parties also hope to cooperate with the military to realize administrative reform. Therefore, the Minister of the Army's response also seems to address this point. (18th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Situation of the General Assembly of the House of Representatives</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The general assembly of the House of Representatives on the 18th began at 1:00 PM, continuing the questions on the speeches of the Ministers of State from the previous day. Suzuki Seigo of the Kokumin Domei took the stage,</p>
<p>saying that the political platform declared by Prime Minister Hayashi was very abstract and could be interpreted as maintaining the status quo or as reform. This was the essence of the current cabinet. However, he hoped that it would not be a weak cabinet, but would develop into a strong cabinet. He praised the Prime Minister's principle of consistent administrative affairs, and again emphasized the failure of diplomacy towards China and the Soviet Union, saying that it was useless to advocate Sino-Japanese friendship today, and that what should be strengthened must be strengthened, and there was a need to cultivate strength. If it is desired to achieve the unification of diplomacy, there is no other way than to break the status quo of the various ministries and bureaus and change the cabinet system to a state council system. What is the government's view? The military ministers admitted to reducing local transfer payments. What are their opinions? Increasing taxes to increase the burden on the people. What considerations are there for this? If it is desired to realize the concretization of administrative reform, should a necessary budget be planned and a temporary Diet be convened quickly? Is there such a will? What is the specific plan to save the situation?</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yuki replied,</p>
<p>that the suspension of local financial transfer payments was not to suppress the rise in prices, but there were other considerations, namely, the reform of local finance. It is planned to quickly study the fundamental policy.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi replied,</p>
<p>that the government is carrying out unemployment relief and other social facilities. The Minister of the Army and the Minister of Foreign Affairs did not reply.</p>
<p>Then, Nakano Seigo took the stage, and his speech was extremely lengthy, taking up two and a half hours. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>In the future, military spending will increase indefinitely. It should be the people's task to endure the temporary pressure in the hope of national peace, and it is Finance Minister Yuki's task to avoid the heavy pressure of the situation. Although the Army says that it has the power to digest a budget of 1.4 billion, it is clear that there is a shortage of iron, coal, and other materials necessary for military preparations. Military strategy says that the use of troops should first be planned to equip the military. I don't know if the military has this preparation.</p>
<p>It is said that the five-year plan to develop Manchuria plans to spend a huge sum of 3 billion yen. Finance Minister Yuki should be asked to work hard to use his experience to develop the new world of Manchuria.</p>
<p>The Hayashi-Foreign Minister's diplomacy, whether towards China, the United Kingdom, or the United States, all exercises friendship uniformly, bowing to all sides. This can be called bowing diplomacy. However, diplomacy and the feeling of friendship should be separate matters. The evils of friendship diplomacy should be broken as soon as possible. As for the conclusion of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany and the problem of the Japan-Soviet fishing treaty, it can generally be considered that diplomacy has no direction.</p>
<p>After Minister of the Army Sugiyama and Finance Minister Yuki replied one after another, Prime Minister Hayashi answered as follows:</p>
<p>Under today's circumstances, it is impossible not to attempt to strengthen national defense. Therefore, it is impossible not to expect the strengthening of national power and the development of the economy. I also believe that in certain situations, I hope to actively adopt a control policy. To regard it as bowing diplomacy is a big mistake. I did not think that struggle diplomacy was right from the beginning. Afterwards, the Diet deliberated on the bills proposed by the government, and Finance Minister Yuki explained the reasons for the proposal. The meeting adjourned at 5:37 PM. (18th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>General Assembly of the House of Representatives Budget Committee</h3>
<p>Secret Meeting Held at the Request of the Minister of the Navy to Hear the Contents of the Military Budget</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The general assembly of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives on the 18th began at 10:00 AM. Katsuma Sisei of the Minseito party took the stage to ask questions.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yuki frankly stated that there was no prospect for the future of finance, but it was surprising to plan such a huge budget and say that there was no prospect for future finance. At the very least, please give a considerable degree of prospect. Finance Minister Yuki replied,</p>
<p>that I had fully consulted with the military and hoped that the military would understand the national economic power and establish a future financial plan. However, there was no time to spare, so I only made revisions to remove the impact of the previous cabinet's budget. I hope to deliberate on it with this meaning.</p>
<p>Katsuma Sisei continued to press Finance Minister Yuki to announce his forecast of the financial plan, saying that the national defense plan in the 1937 budget should have had prospects for future continued expenses. Do you intend to announce this in the Diet? Finance Minister Yuki replied,</p>
<p>that regarding deficit bonds, depending on the situation of the financial world, it is possible to digest even more than 1 billion, so there is no need to worry about this point. Even though the Army and Navy budgets have recognized the 1937 budget, we still intend to fully review future national defense spending with the Army and Navy authorities. Therefore, it is difficult to predict it today. Katsuma also asked the military ministers, saying that although there is no need to worry about the surge in national defense spending in the future, the people want to know the specific facts about the necessity and content of the national defense plan.</p>
<p>Minister of the Navy Yonai replied,</p>
<p>that although I must speak in a public setting, there are many points about military regulations. Please open a secret meeting to explain it. Chairman Oyama started, saying, "Please open a secret meeting according to the government's request." The secret meeting opened at 11:00 AM. However, Chairman Oyama had some misunderstandings about Katsuma's questions and the government's opinions. Therefore, even though the secret meeting was opened, the Army and Navy still did not give any explanation. It was decided to open a secret meeting of the Budget Committee at 10:00 AM on the 19th to hear a detailed explanation on the contents of military spending and the actual situation of why national defense spending has become so huge. The meeting adjourned at 12:10 AM. (18th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Convening of a Temporary Diet</h3>
<p>The Japanese Government Believes It Is Not Necessary; Important National Policies Await Careful Consideration</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the Hayashi Cabinet was established, the Diet was suspended again, and preparations were made to deal with the Diet. As a result, it was only decided to deal with the budget as a central emergency measure, and the previous cabinet's policy of administrative reform was not reviewed and submitted to the Diet. Therefore, the Hayashi Cabinet has not yet reviewed the administrative reform policy and submitted it to the Diet. The Hayashi Cabinet has not yet decided on any specific attitude regarding the previous cabinet's important pending issues, such as the extension of compulsory education and the electricity problem. Therefore, it seems that these important bills will not be submitted to this session of the Diet. Prime Minister Hayashi, Finance Minister Yuki, Minister of the Army Sugiyama, and other government leaders exchanged opinions on this follow-up measure. (18th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government leaders' views on the issue of convening a temporary Diet are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Local finance is closely related to tax system reform, so it must be carefully studied. It is not appropriate to think that it can be quickly passed into law after this session of the Diet. (2) Although it is urgent to reach a conclusion on the important policy of administrative reform due to the urgency of the internal and external situation, hasty action should be rejected, and there is no urgent situation that requires a temporary Diet to be convened to resolve it. (3) Since the Diet is requesting that the next regular Diet be convened in the middle of November, the occurrence of the temporary Diet issue is related to the handling of this issue and must be carefully considered. (11th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Revised Conscription Law in Japan</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Imperial Ordinance for the Enforcement Regulations of the Military Service Law for the Army and Navy has been partially revised and was approved on the 18th. It will be promulgated in the Official Gazette on the 19th. Army authorities have issued a statement regarding this matter, the main points of which are summarized below: The main points of this revision of the Military Service Law Enforcement Regulations are the reduction of the height requirement for recruits by 5 "sun" (approximately 15 cm), and the change in the system for filling vacancies for active-duty soldiers. In the past, those who were not at least 1.55 meters tall could not be considered Class A or Class B soldiers. With this revision, those who are not at least 1.50 meters tall cannot be assigned to either Class A or Class B. Furthermore, in the past, active-duty soldiers and first-line reserve soldiers were conscripted from those who were 1.65 meters or taller. Now, the conscription will be from those who are 1.60 meters or taller. If there are not enough personnel for distribution, then the height requirement will be lowered uniformly for each rank in each unit, in order to sufficiently allocate the necessary personnel. In the past, even those who were physically strong but slightly below the height requirement could not be assigned to Class A or Class B soldiers. There were quite a few people in this category. Now, most of them will be eligible. As for the system for filling vacancies for active-duty soldiers, in the past, vacancies for active-duty soldiers up until the new recruits' enlistment period, and vacancies during the thirty-one days thereafter, had to be filled. This is now abolished. From the standpoint of the recruits, there is a rather long period from conscription to enlistment, and they feel quite anxious about whether they will be able to enlist, which is also quite detrimental to seeking employment. Now, this anxiety is relieved. For the military, it used to be quite late for replacement soldiers to enlist, and education was also inconvenient. Now, it is uniformly exempted. It is said that the revised ordinance will be implemented from the conscription of the twelfth year of Showa (1937). (18th, DOMEI News)</p>
<h3>Counteroffensive by the Western Government Forces in the Harama River Area</h3>
<p>Pushed Forward Five Kilometers on the Southeastern Front – Conscripting Reserve Soldiers to Fight to the End</p>
<p>Madrid – Our correspondent Roland reports: At dawn this morning, government forces launched a counteroffensive against the Nationalist forces' positions southeast of Madrid. Fighting broke out immediately. Both sides had air force, artillery, tank, infantry, and cavalry units participating in the battle, and the situation was extremely intense. Until around 8:00 AM, the Nationalist forces resisted fiercely, and the government forces were not weak either. The battle became increasingly fierce, but around 11:00 AM, the government forces' fighter planes continuously strafed the enemy's concentrated areas with machine guns. The Nationalist forces began to falter. By 6:00 PM, the government forces had advanced approximately three kilometers near the villages of San Martín de la Vega. As a result, the highway from Madrid to Valencia is no longer under Nationalist control. (14th, Havas News)</p>
<p>Madrid – The National Defense Committee issued a battle report stating that, for the past week, the rebel forces have repeatedly launched attacks along the Harama River in the southeast of the capital towards the Valencia highway, attempting to cut off the transportation route between the capital and Valencia, but have so far failed. Although they attacked again yesterday, they were met with a head-on blow from the government forces, and have already retreated in defeat, abandoning several positions. Currently, the government forces have advanced five kilometers along the front line in that area. When the enemy forces retreated, they abandoned a large amount of military equipment. In addition, government warships opened fire and bombarded the forts of Ceuta, Spanish Morocco. (18th, Havas News)</p>
<p>Ávila – Our correspondent Taus Bidet reports: Yesterday, government forces launched two attacks in the Harama River area south of Madrid. Both attacks were very fierce, but in the end, they gained nothing. First, the government artillery began shelling the Nationalist forces' front lines near the Valencia highway and the village of Marañosa at 5:30 AM, with the intention of covering the infantry, detouring to the left bank of the Harama River, and attacking the Nationalist forces from the rear. The Nationalist forces blocked them with machine guns and artillery, causing the government forces to be in a dilemma and unable to move. At that time, two tanks were destroyed by the Nationalist forces. At noon, the militia launched another attack, hoping to break through to the Nationalist forces' trenches and engage in hand-to-hand combat, but they were still defeated by the Nationalist forces. As a result of this battle, the Nationalist forces have made a small advance, and their front-line positions have become even more fortified. The Nationalist forces on the front lines of Escorial, northwest of Madrid, occupied an important position near Robledo de Chavela yesterday afternoon. The location is sufficient to control Escorial, and it is expected that the fall of the city will not be far off. (18th, Havas News)</p>
<p>Valencia – The Spanish government is taking a strong counteroffensive in the Jarama River area to protect the communication between Madrid and Valencia. The government has now ordered the conscription of reserve soldiers of all ranks from the five years between 1932 and 1936. The authorities also stated that they intend to strictly remove senior commanders who are ineffective in combat, and said that the general public now advocates a conscription system and does not prohibit the continued recruitment of volunteers. However, volunteers must join the regular army units in accordance with ordinary military conditions. The government is now planning to implement forced war labor and will consult with various labor unions in order to create a strong war industry and nationalize necessary factories. At the same time, the military authorities have received news that the government forces' battle to protect the capital's lifeline is progressing smoothly. It is reported that the rebel forces have been forced to retreat, especially those retreating around San Martín. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Madrid – Rebel planes bombed the capital and Valencia again today. Several bombs fell in the neutral zone near the American embassy. One bomb hit the embassy but fortunately did not explode. After investigation, 11 people were killed and 72 injured. (18th, Guomin News)</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Volunteers Going to Spain</h3>
<p>French Cabinet Approves Measures</p>
<p>[Paris] The cabinet has approved a plan to prevent volunteers from going to Spain. The plan includes: 1. Strengthening air force surveillance of aircraft departing from airfields; 2. Closely monitoring ports and border stations; 3. Placing special police on trains that may be used by volunteers; 4. Ordering the prohibition of all radio stations from broadcasting recruitment appeals; 5. Intensifying the monitoring of passport issuance. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Paris] The orders, ministerial decrees, and proclamations regarding the prohibition of volunteers from going to Spain will be signed by President Lebrun and will take effect from midnight on February 20th. Thereafter, French railways, shipping companies, and airlines will not be allowed to issue tickets to Spain, with the exception of travelers with special passports, such as journalists and diplomats, who will still be able to purchase tickets to travel to Spain. Furthermore, aircraft are not allowed to pass within ten kilometers of the Pyrenees Mountains bordering France and Spain, in order to prevent them from flying to Spain. (18th, Havas News)</p>
<p>[Paris] The draft law submitted by the government to the National Assembly to prohibit abnormal price increases is scheduled to be implemented from February 15th for a period of six months. During this period, any food or daily necessities whose selling price exceeds the original price on July 1st of last year will be considered an unfair price increase. Even if the raw materials for the manufacture of such goods increase in price, or other costs increase, they cannot be used as a legitimate reason for raising the price of the goods. Factory owners and wholesalers should request the National Price Monitoring Committee to monitor whether the prices they set are appropriate. The Monitoring Committee shall make a decision within fifteen days of receiving the request. Wholesalers who unfairly increase prices may be fined from 500 francs to 5,000 francs. Retailers who unfairly increase prices may be fined from 16 francs to 500 francs. For private residences, shops, and factories that have been punished, the court of first instance may order the posting of the crime in front of the door for two weeks to serve as a warning. The court of first instance may also order the publication of such crimes in one or more daily newspapers. (18th, Havas News)</p>

<h3>US Senator Proposes Constitutional Amendment</h3>
<p>Congress Shall Have the Power to Re-enact Any Law Deemed Unconstitutional</p>
<p>[Washington] Senators Wheeler and Boaz today introduced a constitutional amendment in the Senate, authorizing Congress to re-enact any law deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court with a two-thirds vote in both houses. The senators expect the proposal to be accepted as a compromise between the supporters and opponents of the president's plan to reorganize the Supreme Court. The Senate then passed a resolution by Judiciary Committee Chairman McCarron, requesting that government departments submit detailed information on all congressional laws that the Supreme Court has invalidated. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Russian Appointed Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Secretariat has formally announced the appointment of Sukholin, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in France, as Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations. Sukholin is currently 50 years old, was born in Geneva, and studied in both this city and Moscow. In 1931, he was appointed Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in France. In 1935, he was promoted to Chargé d'affaires in Romania, and then transferred back to the Paris Embassy as Counselor, a position he holds to this day. He was a member of the Soviet delegation at the 1932 Disarmament Conference and the 1933 World Economic Conference. (18th, Havas News)</p>

<h3>Detailed Record of the Succession of Political Power in Shaanxi After the Xi'an Incident</h3>
<p>Currently, Yu Xuezhong and He Zhuguo are working with Gu Zhutong to plan for the aftermath.</p>
<p>Xi'an Correspondence: The Xi'an Incident erupted last winter, and two months have passed since then. Although it has now come to an end, the evolution and changes in political power and personnel have been extremely complicated. However, due to traffic obstructions, rumors are often inaccurate, and it is especially difficult to obtain accurate information due to the severe restrictions on news in the past. After the resolution of the incident, our reporter went to Xi'an to investigate the situation in all aspects, and recorded the observations as follows.</p>
<p>Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters</p>
<p>Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters</p>
<p>Originally, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek served as the Commander-in-Chief, and Chief of Staff Yan Daogang took charge of everything. But in reality, Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang oversaw the overall situation. After the incident, Yan was detained, and the headquarters was reorganized into the "Northwest Provisional Military Committee of the Allied Forces," with Dong Yingbin, commander of the 57th Army (whose original position was filled by the promoted division commander Miao Chengcang), replacing Yan as Chief of Staff. Initially, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng were appointed as Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Military Committee, but later they were changed to Chairman and Vice-Chairman. When Zhang accompanied Generalissimo Chiang to Nanjing, he left a handwritten order instructing Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong to be fully responsible for military and political affairs. However, Yu flew back to Lanzhou after the incident, and only came to Xi'an a week before the peaceful resolution. In the meantime, Dong Yingbin, Wang Yizhe, and He Zhuguo worked together to support the situation, while Yang Hucheng was not much involved. A few days before the Central Army entered the city, Yang went to Sanyuan to take care of personal matters, and Dong led the working staff to move to Binzhou to work. At this time, Wang had already been tragically murdered. Currently, only Yu and He remain in Xi'an, consulting with the Director of the Executive Headquarters, Gu Zhutong, on the aftermath. After this, the name of the headquarters will be changed again, perhaps to the Gansu Pacification Commissioner's Office, in order to command its remaining troops, because its Xi'an Garrison Headquarters uses this name.</p>
<p>Xi'an Pacification Commissioner's Office</p>
<p>After the Xi'an Incident, Yang Hucheng continued to use the name of the Xi'an Pacification Commissioner's Office to exercise his powers, and the internal personnel were not changed. Only Huang Niantang, the Director of the Transportation Department, was arrested for allegedly sending a telegram to Luoyang urging the rescue of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. He was eventually shot and killed before the peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Provincial Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Most of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee members were detained during the incident. After Generalissimo Chiang returned to Nanjing, they went east unharmed. They then set up a temporary office of the Party Headquarters in Tongguan, which was still presided over by the original members. Zhang and Yang had appointed Wang Bingnan and four others as members of the Mass Movement Guidance Committee to act on behalf of the Provincial Party Headquarters. After the peace agreement, they were immediately dissolved. Currently, the original Provincial Party Committee members, such as Guo Zijun, have all returned to the province.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Provincial Government</p>
<p>After Shao Lizi resigned as the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Zhang and Yang first appointed Du Bincheng as the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government to maintain the situation. There were not many changes in the internal personnel. Then, Wang Yishan, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, was ordered to concurrently serve as the Chairman of the Provincial Government until January 1st. Although Sun Weiru did not publicly announce his assumption of the position of Chairman of the Provincial Government appointed by the Central Government, all departments had already received a clear order from the Provincial Government, notifying them that Sun would officially be responsible for matters from that day onwards. Now that the incident has been resolved, there is no question that Sun will take office.</p>
<p>Department of Civil Affairs</p>
<p>Peng Zhaoxian, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, was dismissed after the Shaanxi Incident. Yang Hucheng's outgoing Chief of Staff, Wang Yishan, succeeded him. Because Wang was concurrently serving as the Director of the Provincial Government, most of the department's affairs were handled by the Secretary-General, Mi Zanchen. For the county magistrates of the various counties, except for Weng Cheng, the magistrate of Chang'an County, who was detained after the Shaanxi Incident (the Chang'an residents' association organized a committee to settle Weng's accounts, but nothing further was heard), and Han Zhuoru, the Director of Sun Weiru's Provincial Office, who was acting as his agent, there were no other changes. Occasionally, a small number of county magistrates fled after the incident, and the Civil Affairs Department simply selected people from nearby counties to fill the positions.</p>
<p>Department of Finance</p>
<p>Xu Shifu and Feng Qinzao, the army commander of Yang Hucheng's army, were from the same hometown and had a very close relationship. Feng recommended Xu to serve as the Director of the Pacification Commissioner's Office and as a counselor. At the beginning of the incident, Feng expressed his opposition. Yang Hucheng considered Xu to be experienced and prudent, and also wanted to please Feng, so he eagerly appointed Xu as the Director of the Department of Finance. Zhu Jingzhou, the original director, had only taken office for a few weeks when he encountered the incident. Zhu also had a good personal relationship with Yu Xuezhong and could have been reappointed, but Zhu firmly declined. Xu knew that his position was temporary and tried to appease and retain the old subordinates of the former director, Ning Qianting (who died of fright after the incident). In addition, tax revenues were stagnant, and there were not many affairs to handle, so he was able to maintain the status quo until now.</p>
<p>Department of Construction</p>
<p>Although the director of the department, Lei Baohua, was from Shaanxi, his relationship with Shao Lizi was quite deep. After the incident, he expressed his firm resignation. The provincial government believed that all construction had virtually stopped during the military period, so it did not appoint anyone to succeed Lei. Lei himself was also uneasy in his position. Finally, during the mediation of the peace, he flew to Nanjing with Li Zhigang, Yang Hucheng's representative stationed in Nanjing, and never returned. This position is still vacant.</p>
<p>Department of Education</p>
<p>Zhou Xuechang, the director of the department, had been in office for many years. In recent years, he had been ostracized by people in the education sector of the province, and his work became increasingly difficult. In addition, radical ideas filled the minds of students in various schools, and student unrest was hidden. The student petition last winter was one example. At the time of the incident, Zhou became the focus of student attacks. Fortunately, he escaped danger and left Shaanxi. The provincial government appointed Li Shouting, Zhou's predecessor, to succeed him. Many of Zhou's staff were replaced, and due to environmental factors, he tried to accommodate elements with color as much as possible. The appointment of Yang Mingxuan, a core figure in the Northwest National Salvation Association, as the director of the primary school teacher training center, and Jiang Longji and others as principals of various middle schools, were further evidence of this. As for the students, they were quite radical and active at first, but later, due to the unstable situation, most of the students' families forced their children to return home, and the schools went on vacation early and indefinitely. To this day, no date has been set for school to resume.</p>
<p>Military and Police Supervisory Office</p>
<p>Xie Ke, the director of the Military and Police Supervisory Office, was highly respected by all parties. In the past, Yang Zhenya, the commander of the 3rd Regiment of the Central Military Police, Ma Zhichao, the director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, and Zhang Yizhong, the director of the Pacification Commissioner's Office Military Law Department, all served concurrently as deputy directors, and a mixed organization was established as the Military and Police Supervisory Office, with Xie as the director. After the incident, Xie left his post to work for peace. Ma and Yang went into hiding, and Zhang was killed. Therefore, Sun Mingwen, Zhang Xueliang's special forces commander, took over as director. Sun was a young general in the Northeast Army, lacking a soul, and advocated resisting the central government and starting a civil war. Later, Sun murdered Wang Yizhe, commander of the 67th Army, and three others, attempting to create a terrifying situation. Afterwards, he fled in fear of punishment. Peace was also declared soon after. The Pacification Commissioner's Office then appointed Wang Zongshan, the director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, to concurrently serve as director.</p>
<p>Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Ma Zhichao, the director of the bureau, was a student in the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy from Shaanxi. He had been in office for several years. On the day of the incident, the Public Security Bureau was attacked by the 2nd Security Brigade of Yang Hucheng's army. After a fierce battle for half a day, it finally succumbed. Ma disguised himself as a coachman and fled Xi'an. Zhao Shoushan, the brigade commander of Sun Weiru, was initially appointed as the director of the bureau. Zhao then took his troops to garrison Sanyuan, and Wang Zongshan, Sun's counselor, succeeded him. Wang was a student from Shaanxi who had studied in the United States and had served as a member of the Gansu Provincial Government and as a regiment commander. He worked hard for peace this time.</p>
<p>Martial Law Headquarters</p>
<p>On the day of the Shaanxi Incident, Sun Weiru was appointed by Zhang and Yang as the commander of the Xi'an Martial Law Headquarters. Later, Liu Duoquan, the commander of the 105th Division of the Northeast Army, was appointed as the deputy commander in order to jointly maintain the chaotic situation. At that time, the city's defense and security were jointly responsible by Sun's 2nd Security Brigade and two units of the 105th Division. The Martial Law Headquarters was not abolished until peace was declared. Before the Central Army entered the province, the 2nd Security Brigade was replaced by the 1st Security Brigade to maintain order in the city because of its poor military discipline, and they were able to coexist peacefully.</p>
<p>Security Office</p>
<p>Zhang Kunsheng, the Director of the Security Office, was also a student in the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy from Shaanxi. Because he had a small force of troops, he was attacked even more fiercely than the Public Security Bureau that day. After the incident, Zhang also went into hiding. Yang Hucheng then established another Security Headquarters, appointing himself as the Commander of Security for the entire province, and appointing Han Weixi as the Chief of Staff.</p>

<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Xingzhong Company recently plans to occupy the right to transport goods on the Haihe River between Dagu, Tanggu, and Tianjin, and organize a tugboat and barge transportation company, equipped with dozens of ships, specializing in the transshipment and lighterage business in the waterway between Dagu and Tianjin that large steamships cannot reach. However, there are foreign-owned barge transportation companies operating in the Haihe River, and the Tianjin Customs Shipping Office has already obtained a patent. In order to handle the same business, Xingzhong is afraid that the Customs will not allow it, so the current plan is determined to avoid surface business conflicts, publicly stating that the company is only engaged in loading reed salt from Tanggu and barging it to the outer port for export to large steamships, to show that it is not competing with the foreign-owned companies. Last week, the Tianjin Branch of Xingzhong Company formulated the outline of the business organization, which is roughly as follows: "1. The name of the company is set as Tanggu Transportation Company; 2. The capital is 3 million yuan, the first installment of 1 million yuan will be collected and the business will be started immediately; 3. The company organization will be handled in accordance with the Japanese company law, with Xingzhong Company as the center, and the Dajin Vapor Ship Company, International Transportation Company, and Japan-Manchuria Takuso Association jointly investing capital; 4. The head office is located in Dalian, and the branch office is located in Tanggu; 5. The organization will be established in early April." Xingzhong Director Hirayama and Branch Manager Qingye are currently busy preparing in Tianjin. Since this news came out, foreign merchants have paid close attention to it. In recent years, smuggling has been rampant in North China, and most of the goods come from Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao. It has not been seen that they are transported to Tianjin via the Haihe River. This is due to the strict inspection and blockade by the Customs, but at the same time, the management of barges in the Haihe River is in the hands of the British and Americans, which is isolated from smugglers. Although the vagrants intend to use the river to directly transport smuggled goods from outside Dagukou, it is practically impossible. Now, Xingzhong Company is handling this transportation company, and its desire to obtain the transportation rights of the Haihe River for the convenience of transportation by Japanese public and private sectors is obvious. It is impossible for foreign merchants to prevent its establishment, but they hope that the Customs will have a good way to deal with it so that its plan will not be realized.</p>
<p>The export of Changlu salt transportation is still under negotiation. Xingzhong Company is responsible for handling this matter this year. Last week, it specially sent Managing Director Uchida to Tianjin to coordinate with Director Hirayama, Branch Manager Qingye, Tianjin Deputy Consul Nagai Junichi, and others to negotiate with the Changlu Transportation Office, Lufeng Store, and the salt households in Hantang and Lianggu salt fields, and continue to carry out a transaction to purchase 200,000 to 250,000 tons. The Changlu Transportation Office entrusted this matter to Lufeng Store, ordering it to contact the salt households on its behalf and persuade them. However, the salt households have deep-rooted prejudices, insisting on the principle of losing more by selling more and losing less by selling less, and only allowing the export of 100,000 tons, and the price of salt per ton must be higher than last year. Xingzhong Company has agreed to slightly increase the price, offering 2.4 yuan per ton, which is 0.55 yuan less than the 2.95 yuan demanded by the salt households. However, the purchase quantity must be around 250,000 tons. Currently, Hokkaido Tokushu Soda Co., Ltd. and Asahi Glass Co., Ltd. in Japan are in urgent need of chemical industrial salt and expect it to be shipped by April 1st. Therefore, the activities of Nagai and Uchida and others have become more active in recent days. It is rumored that the purchase contract may be signed early next month, but when asked about the Changlu Transportation Office, they denied it. (16th)</p>

Because it was coveted by bandits, Yan suddenly received a report from the gravedigger saying that the coffin had been dug up and the coffin lid had been opened. After the jurisdictional police station was notified, they went to the site with the client to investigate and found that all the burial items, except for one gold ingot, had been stolen.

<h3>A Record of Shanghai Team's Three Matches in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Won the Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Championship 4-3  Hong Kong Chinese United New Army Suffered Defeat 4-1  Lost to the Strongest Hong Kong Military United Team 1-2</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) The annual Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match was held at the Naval Ground on the 11th of this month (i.e., the first day of the Lunar New Year). Around 3 o'clock, the stands were already full, and latecomers were unable to enter. Before the match, the Shifford Army Band performed to celebrate. The Shanghai team came to the match this time with an all-Western lineup, and its strength was unusually strong. In addition to defeating the Hong Kong team with a score of 4-3 on New Year's Day to regain the championship, it also defeated the Hong Kong Chinese United Team with a score of 4-1 at the Caroline Hill Ground on the 13th. Therefore, the Shanghai team's southern expedition this time was quite successful. Looking back at the Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Match, it has been held 18 times to date. The Shanghai team has won 10 times and lost 8 times, while the Hong Kong team has won 8 times and lost 10 times. The Hong Kong team's strength in this session was originally able to beat the Shanghai team, but unfortunately it failed to do so as desired, resulting in signing an alliance under duress. Fans who care about the Hong Kong team all regret it for the Hong Kong team.</p>
<p>The match started at 3:30. The Shanghai team wore white jerseys, and the Hong Kong team wore blue jerseys. Amidst the cheers of more than 10,000 fans, the Shanghai team took the lead. The center forward Lao took big strides and passed to the right striker. Fuen advanced along the line, but was limited by Dagaoshan Nu. Hui Tang led the army to counterattack, and Jingxiang took the opportunity to break through, but was snatched by Mashan'er. Shuiyi and Jingxiang made short passes to advance, step by step, and passed the ball to the left, but no one responded, and they returned without success. At this time, the Hong Kong team took a siege position. Wilson responded and made a flat shot 20 yards from the goal, but failed to score. Before long, Feng Shentui tried his footwork, and the ball went very hard, but it went over the goal. The Shanghai team's defenders resisted strongly. Baoxiutuo and Bolinggai counterattacked urgently, but were repelled by Tiansheng and Dagaoshan Nu. Wilson missed the ball within inches of the goal. Everyone regretted that a good opportunity to win was missed. In the heavy siege, Walter of the Shanghai team sent the ball far away. Center forward Lao responded, dodged Dagaoshan Nu, and Tiansheng returned to the army, but it was too late, so Lao scored with a low shot, opening the record. The game restarted at the center circle. Rongzhao fought bravely and left the field. Hong Kong changed to fighting with ten people. The Shanghai army took this opportunity and launched an attack from the border by Fuen, and the pass was just right. Dagaoshan Nu came out, slightly delayed, so Lao used a header to score. Bao was about to catch the ball at this time, but unexpectedly the ball rebounded off Baoxiutuo's foot after landing, and he then shot into the empty goal, forming a situation of 2-0. The Shanghai team's military prestige was greatly boosted by this unexpected gain. Fuen was unsupervised and was rushed over again, hitting the top of the post and rebounding into the net. In the first half, the Shanghai team won 3-0. After changing sides, the Hong Kong team worked hard to strengthen itself. Only two minutes after the start, Feng Jingxiang was rescued by Rongzhao and sent a light pass. Hui Tang made a left-right dribble, broke through the last line of defense, and regained the situation of 3-1 with a single shot into the city. Hui Tang followed up with a shot, which could have directly attacked Huanglong, but Bao Saizhong was as helpful as a god, and made a diving save, unexpectedly turning the tide, and the Shanghai team's lack of loss was really a blessing. However, not long after, the Hong Kong team came back again, Shuiyi and Jingxiang worked together, Feng transported to the left, and the ball hit the leg of an enemy guard. Wilson took advantage of the situation to invade to the right and bounced the ball into the net, becoming a situation of 3-2. Unexpectedly, Fuen followed up with a shot, and the ball went as fast as lightning, and Jianping could not save it at all. The Hong Kong gate was lost again, and the Shanghai team created an advantage of 4-2 again. Hui Tang was still not discouraged, and took the opportunity to sprint, and was surrounded by three enemy guards, knocking Hui Tang down. A penalty of 12 yards was awarded, and Li scored the goal, chasing back the situation of 4-3. After another period of fighting, each team gained nothing. Heaven did not bless the Hong Kong team, and finally there was an alliance under duress. Re-victory over Hualian and the Shanghai Interport Representative Team's performance match against the Hong Kong Hualian Team was held at the Caroline Hill South China Stadium at 3:30 pm on the 13th. The audience was still crowded. The lineup of both sides was as follows:</p>
<p>The center line began to push forward, and the five tigers of the Hua team bravely moved forward. Deng Guangsen passed the ball to Chen Dehui, and Dehui lost sight of Zou Wenzhi, who raised his foot to explore, and the ball responded by entering the net, opening the record. Unexpectedly, in a few minutes, the enemy generals were as fierce as wolves, and the Hua team was thrown on their backs and horses turned over. Tui Le robbed the ball and passed it to the left, and Baoxiutuo leaped up and headed the ball into the net, making it a 1-1 situation. After restarting the ball, the Hualian team was already showing signs of decline. Deng Guangsen was injured and left the field again. A few minutes later, the enemy striker launched an attack. Lao Ba dribbled the ball forward, and the Hua team's defender rushed to save, but the ball had already flown into the net under the foot of Xiaohua Te. After another fight, Mai Zhaohan accidentally committed a handball and was penalized with a 12-yard penalty, which was kicked by Gelinbo and hit Xu Heng's chest, rebounded out, and Xiaohua Te added another foot, making the score 3-1. Lemon passed, and after changing sides, the Hua team generals were like old men after illness, and it was difficult to walk. Lin Depu was expelled from the field again for committing a foul, and only ten people were fighting. Fortunately, the two generals Mai and Huang joined forces to resist the enemy, and Xu Heng also carefully guarded the gate, so although the enemy repeatedly fired secret shots, only one goal was scored by Gelinbo. As a result, the Shanghai team won the Hualian team by a score of four to one. Defeated by the Military United Team, the Shanghai Interport Football Team came to Hong Kong this time with an all-Western lineup to attend the Interport Match. The athletes were full of energy and had the heart to win. On New Year's Day, they defeated the Hong Kong team with a score of 4-3 and regained the Interport Championship, and then defeated the Hong Kong Hualian Team with a score of 4-1. Two consecutive victories are enough to be proud of. On the 15th, they met with the Military United elite at the So Kon Po Stadium. This match was one of the most exciting scenes of the Shanghai Interport Team's southern match with the East China Team. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Interport Team not only did not easily win the Military United Team, but was defeated by the Military United Team with a score of 2-1, failing to maintain its winning record and return to Shanghai in triumph. The military fans watching the game shouted wildly, and the sound shook the valley. The Shanghai team's defeat in the final battle was really unfortunate. The team will take the British mail ship Nalutda on the 18th (Thursday) from Hong Kong to return to Shanghai after the competition in Hong Kong is over.</p>

<h3>Commenting on Hong Kong's Defeat to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai team's charge is fierce and good at using both wings. Defense and attacking the goal are above the Hong Kong team.</p>
<p>The Shanghai team's success in this Interport Football Match was in the first half. They relied on Bao Saizhong to guard the steel gate, so that the burly center-back Walter and Mashan'er surrounded Li Huitang, and relied on the valiant wings to make a rapid counterattack. Although the Shanghai team was repeatedly surrounded, every counterattack could put the Hong Kong team to death. On the other hand, the Hong Kong team's striker crawled in the Shanghai hinterland without progress.</p>
<p>The connection is loose and the advancement is very slow. The comparison between the two is different in speed and slowness. Moreover, the center forward of the Shanghai team, Lawlers Torres, specializes in charging, always charging in first and then taking the ball (repeatedly violating this rule, but the referee was very negligent in this regard). Dagaoshan was also knocked down by Lao many times. The remaining four forwards were also able to use the English-style long pass method to charge and make zigzag-shaped long passes. When they saw the ball, they rushed, and when they rushed, they shot, which often made it impossible for the Hong Kong goalkeeper to cover the goal, and the defenders were exhausted. After the Shanghai team won the second lucky goal, the morale of the Hong Kong army was greatly hit. If the Hong Kong team's striker had not repeatedly missed the opportunity and the referee's decision had been negligent, the Hong Kong team would have had a great hope of tying the score at 4-4 and then winning. The reason for the Hong Kong team's defeat is that all the generals had a slight contempt for the enemy early on, resulting in the loss in the first half. In the second half, they worked hard to strengthen themselves and fought hard, and were able to pull back three cities. Moreover, in the overall war, the attackers were eight or nine out of ten, which shows that the Hong Kong team has the potential to win the Shanghai team. Unfortunately, they frustrated their sharpness, resulting in a feeling of being too late to regret it.</p>
<p>All parts of the Hong Kong team's army revealed weaknesses. The striker adopted a narrow W-shaped offensive strategy, and its sharpness was at the sharpest point, that is, the center forward Li Huitang. The entire line of five forwards, except for Li, could break through the enemy's defense several times alone, and the other forwards did not try to attack the goal. Although Feng and Shuiyi had a skilled connection, it did not help the overall situation. Wilson and Biford made slight progress in the second half, but they missed many opportunities in the first half. In terms of center backs, Jin Bilu stuck to the old ways and failed to adapt to the situation. He always made short passes with the two center backs and then helped the forwards, giving the Shanghai team a chance to deploy. Yi Yunshi was brave, but unfortunately he was not safe in his position and went out alone from time to time, so the right wing of the Shanghai team had sufficient activity. Therefore, the loss of goals by the Hong Kong team mostly came from the right wing of the Shanghai team, and Yi Yunshi should be blamed. Among the three center backs, Rongzhao was the best. In terms of defenders, it was unexpected that the veteran Dagaoshan Nu also performed abnormally in this battle. Tiansheng and Jianping were unstable due to Gaoshan Nu,</p>
<p>Lost confidence and the performance was far from as good as in the past. The Shanghai team was good at using high balls, so that the five forwards used the charging method to advance. This was really not something that Jianping could handle. If Roland was used, the two inside guards could focus all their efforts on blocking the enemy's forwards, or could reduce their worries. Bao Saizhong of the Shanghai team was really the first to contribute. Li Huitang made several powerful shots, which were all saved. Unfortunately, none of the Hong Kong team's forwards could charge into the battle and shake the Shanghai team's defense. Therefore, the Shanghai team's defenders were able to calmly deal with the difficulties. The Shanghai team won three goals first, but there were three goals lost in the second half, which shows that the wind was also very important. In the last three minutes, Li Huitang hooked a ball, which the goalkeeper could not possibly save, but Heaven did not abandon the Shanghai team, and Mashan'er happened to be standing there, turning the tide. This was the Shanghai team's luck and the Hong Kong team's misfortune.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chinese Football Team Leaves Hong Kong for Guangdong</h3>
<p>Fundraising Match for the Convenience Hospital in Guangzhou Tomorrow</p>
<p>Shanghai Interport Team Changes to Return North Today</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th – The Shanghai Chinese Football Team, a group of 13 people, led by Jiang Xiangqing, went to Guangdong by car at 8 am on the 18th to hold a fundraising match for the Convenience Hospital on the 20th. Also, the Shanghai Interport Football Team Zha Xu and others were originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the British mail ship Nalutra on the 18th, but the ship was delayed in arriving in Hong Kong and changed to return north on the 19th.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 17th – The East China Team played a performance match with the Hong Kong United Team at Caroline Hill at 4 pm on the 17th. Li Ning was not in the game due to injury and was replaced by Gu Shangxiang and Jiang Zhaoxiang as left and right fullbacks. Feng Yunyou and Wang Kehou were the middle and left backs. The rest were unchanged. Because the striker was weak and the connection was not good, after ten minutes, the Hong Kong team's Xiaogaoshan Nu shot a goal. Five minutes later, Li Anna headed a goal, and Di Nuosheng and Xiaogaoshan Nu each scored another goal. In the first half, East China only had parry and no counterattack. In the second half, East China tried to recover, and Luo Douwen shot for the first time after ten minutes, but it was blocked. On the contrary, the Hong Kong team's Hu Li shot a long shot from 30 yards away, and Liu Shizhan committed a foul and was penalized with a 12-yard free kick, which was kicked by the Hong Kong goalkeeper Roland, and he kicked it in, which is also rare for goalkeepers to meet. The Hong Kong team, with the victory and defeat already determined, held on to the victory and did not attack fiercely anymore. East China took the opportunity to counterattack and shot several times, but none of them worked. As a result, the team lost with a score of 0 to 6. The team has finished its performance in Hong Kong and decided to go to the province on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Jinde Steadily Takes the Morning League Championship</h3>

<h3>An Exciting Scene of the Sino-British Shooting Match Zhang Yingda Won Clark Yesterday</h3>
<p>Match Result: 600 to 415 Points  Today's Last Game: Zhu Qiliang vs. Nie Ke'er</p>
<p>The Sino-British shooting match has been played in four groups, and China has won three and lost one. The war situation in the past was the most exciting yesterday for Zhang Yingda and Clark. Zhang Yingda won Clark by 185 points yesterday, thanks to the last three shots, and the audience was fascinated by the wonderful performances of both sides and the competition for scores up and down. At 5:30 pm today, the first group of the Chinese team, Zhu Qiliang, will play against the British Nie Ke'er, and the game will still be held in the 88th Association on Nanjing Road. Zhu's skills are higher than the opponent's, and victory is not a problem. Therefore, the championship of this session will undoubtedly belong to China.</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda gave me a very good impression yesterday. His expertise in opening energy and sending bullets to fall are all performed in a relaxed and fluent manner. A shot of 83 points was created by various methods, which won full acclaim and was his proud masterpiece in recent months.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the two were neck and neck, with a difference of no more than ten points, and the maximum distance was only more than 30 points. Zhang Yingda was always ahead of Clark. By the time of a shot of 42 and another shot of 83, Clark was lagging behind by more than 124 points (489 to 365). Finally, he added another shot of 43 points, and Clark had no hope of winning, and finally lost with a score of 415 to 600.</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda 22, 38, 30, 52, 29, 31, 42, 83, 43</p>

<h3>Ji Province Prepares for Normal Education Conference</h3>
<p>(Tianjin, 18th) The Ji Education Department has scheduled to hold a provincial normal education conference in Baoding on March 8th and has prepared for it.</p>
<h3>Special Exhibition at the City Museum Extended</h3>
<p>Closed at 4:30 PM on the 21st. The Shanghai City Museum held its first special exhibition, which opened to the public on February 11th. Coinciding with the Lunar New Year, the crowds visiting were particularly large, averaging several thousand people daily. In the museum's various exhibition halls, visitors were packed shoulder to shoulder, and the special exhibition hall was even more overcrowded. This was because the exhibition hall featured over a thousand films, all capturing the exteriors and interiors of museums around the world, along with their displays. These were all exhibited together, showcasing magnificent and solemn architecture, elegant and refined garden landscapes, diverse display methods, and vast collections of exhibits. As a result, visitors felt as if they were personally present in those places. It was reported that the exhibition was originally scheduled to last for only one week. However, due to the continued high attendance and numerous requests for extension from groups, schools, and individuals, it has been decided to extend the exhibition until 4:30 PM on February 21st, after which it will not be extended further. With only three days remaining, those who have not yet visited should not miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>

<h3>Chinese Education Society</h3>
<p>Seeking Opinions on Attending the World Education Conference and the Location of This Year's Annual Meeting. The Seventh World Education Conference is scheduled to be held in Tokyo, Japan, in August of this year. The Chinese Education Society is currently collaborating with national educational academic societies to discuss matters related to participation. However, rumors circulate that some countries not recognized by the League of Nations (such as the puppet state of Manchuria) are requesting to send representatives to participate, which would severely undermine our national dignity. In the event that this becomes a reality, how should we respond? This necessitates seeking high-level opinions from our members in advance to avoid difficulties in making temporary arrangements. It is reported that a few questions have been drafted to solicit opinions to ensure safety: (1) If the puppet state participates, can we participate first and then withdraw to express protest and opposition? (2) If we learn that the puppet state will participate, can we decide not to travel east to participate? (3) Are there any other suggestions? Furthermore, the society's third annual meeting was held in Wuchang last February. The following locations have been resolved for the next annual meeting: (1) Beiping (2) Lushan (3) Qingdao (4) Chengdu. The board of directors will deliberate based on the prevailing circumstances and make a final decision on the location. Subsequently, it was submitted to the second board of directors meeting for resolution, which entrusted the standing committee of directors to decide on one location and notify it. It is now reported that letters have been sent to solicit public opinion, selecting one location from the above four for reference and to facilitate the final decision.</p>

<h3>Overview of Shanghai Experimental Elementary School (II)</h3>
<p>Special report from this newspaper, investigation by Hu Zuyin.</p>
<p>2. School Buildings and Equipment</p>
<p>The school is currently divided into three sections: Section 1 is located on Shangwen Road, covering an area of over 2.8 mu. The school buildings were constructed in the third year of the Republic (1914) with a main structure shaped like a horizontal concave character. Section 2 is located on Wenmiao Road, covering approximately 4 mu, and utilizes the Liu Gong Minzhong Second Ancestral Hall as school buildings. Section 3 is located in Wujia Lane on Hu-Min Road, with a relatively large foundation, covering approximately 50 mu. The school buildings here are newly built, with construction beginning in July of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) and completed four months later.</p>
<p>The school buildings in Section 3 are in a linear style, divided into two stories with a corridor in the middle of the upper and lower floors. Both sides are classrooms, totaling eighteen rooms. Later, due to the sharp increase in boarding students, the newly built dormitories were insufficient, so two bungalows were built in July of the 24th year of the Republic (1935). Recently, the school has also been planning to raise funds to build a gymnasium that can also serve as an auditorium. In addition, because the new school buildings have a wide foundation and are located in a quiet rural environment, the school scenery is very beautiful; and the layout of the campus, pavilions, lawns, and ponds is a good place for children to study and play.</p>
<p>In terms of equipment, the school provides a reasonable amount of teaching equipment, such as instruments, specimens, books, and sports equipment, every semester for use. According to the statistics of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the school has a total of 471 instruments, 212 specimens, 2745 reference books for teachers and staff, 2239 children's books, 726 sports and Boy Scout equipment, 4526 other equipment, and 3034 utensils.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>The Disastrous Fall of Sanpin Yarn Increases Unease in the Yarn Market</p>
<p>Warehouse Stockpiles Increase, Industry Tends to Dump, Spot Trends Are Smooth, but Pressure Is Heavy</p>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the decline has restarted, mainly because rumors about the paper money issue have subsided. At the same time, the Osaka Sanpin yarn market has plummeted, with the long-term contract breaking through the 40-yuan mark. This has shocked people, and sellers have sprung up, causing market prices to turn downstream. However, spot yarn buyers still have considerable demand, and the Sichuan yarn market is also developing. However, industry insiders, seeing the increasing stockpiles in warehouses, are only inclined to dump their goods.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Falls by Two Yuan Strongly</p>
<p>In the early session of the marked yarn market, near-term contracts were firm due to Indian merchants taking delivery. Auctioning turned lower in long-term contracts. This was because the Osaka Sanpin yarn market was falling step by step, coupled with the paper money issue. Market rumors were relatively subdued, and people's minds were calm. However, this month, many parties released limited-price yarn at 55 yuan, so the market situation became more stable. However, most of the industry tends to dump their goods, and the pressure is also heavy. As a result, the prices of each month fell by 0.2 to 1.2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon session, the market suddenly changed, as the Osaka Sanpin yarn market was unable to support itself, and the closing price fell, breaking through the 40-yuan mark. This made people panic, and sellers took the opportunity to put on high pressure, making the decline more obvious. As a result, the prices of each month fell by another 0.5 to 1.34 yuan compared to the morning session's closing price. According to the investigation, Jifeng sold 1,100 bales, Yudai 1,350 bales, Yiji 850 bales, Dachangcheng 2,500 bales, Changfeng 700 bales, Hengchang 1,700 bales, Hengyi 900 bales, Runkang 1,400 bales, Yongda 1,400 bales, and Shengyuan 550 bales. Dafu bought 1,100 bales, Zhenda 1,200 bales, Gengfeng 4,350 bales, Senkang 1,200 bales, Xiecheng 1,500 bales, Yudai 1,050 bales, Jinchang 1,600 bales, and Changji 800 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales to Sichuan Active</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are good. According to statistics, all types of yarn dealers bought 2,398 bales throughout the day. The selling price is similar to the previous day. The purchase volume of each type is listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton Restrained by Yarn</p>
<p>The cotton market is mediocre and weakening, because American cotton is sluggish, and people are very frustrated. In the afternoon, as the yarn market fell step by step, the cotton market, which is closely related, was dragged into the whirlpool. The long-term contract broke through the 5-yuan mark.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Falls by 0.65 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early session of the marked cotton market, the prices of each month saw a slight decline. Because American cotton fluctuated, up and down 2 to 5 points, Indian cotton was suspended, and the overseas cotton industry was still lackluster, the market situation was ordinary. At the same time, the yarn market declined, and buyers were scarce. As a result, the prices of each month fell by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon session, the market atmosphere was still peaceful. Subsequently, cotton prices fell, affected by the decline in yarn prices. At the close, the decline was fierce. As a result, the prices of each month fell by a large 0.45 to 0.5 yuan compared to the morning session's closing price. According to the investigation, Yikang sold 3,300 dan, Jifeng 2,900 dan, Hexing 2,700 dan, Renfeng 1,800 dan, Yuanxingchang 4,900 dan, Daji 1,000 dan, Changyu 2,100 dan, Yuanyi 2,400 dan, Yichang 3,000 dan, Changfeng 3,100 dan, Tonghe 1,400 dan, and Xingchang 1,700 dan. Yudai bought 14,400 dan, Jinchang 4,400 dan, Shenji 3,500 dan, Yuanyi 2,100 dan, Gengfeng 5,500 dan, Xinchang 3,600 dan, Tongji 1,300 dan, Deda 1,000 dan, and Changfeng 1,300 dan. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Cotton Mill Offices Turn Dull</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption has become depressed. Because the cotton futures have fallen, factories are stagnating, and sources have not yet opened up.</p>
<p>The Decline of Sanpin Yarn and Cotton is Intensifying</p>
<p>An Osaka telegram on the 18th stated that spot yarn fell by 2 to 5 yuan. 16-count Fanmian was 233 yuan, down 3 yuan. 20-count Jinyu was 253 yuan, down 2 yuan. 40-count Wuxing was 400 yuan, down 5 yuan. 42-count Zhizi was 378 yuan, down 4 yuan. Sanpin yarn futures fell by 2.3 to 6.5 yuan. The near-term contract was 242.4 yuan, and the long-term contract was 240.07 yuan. Cotton also fell by 0.8 to 0.45 yuan. The near-term contract was 72.8 yuan, and the long-term contract was 74.15 yuan.</p>
<p>American New Cotton Sold by Foreign Firms</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with slightly active trading, mostly between industry insiders. Prices ranged from unchanged to a decrease of 3 points. The March contract fell due to long liquidation and hedging, then recovered due to purchases by industry insiders and cooperatives. Private estimates indicate that approximately 350,000 bales of pledged cotton were sold. News from Washington stated that the terms for selling pledged cotton by the Commodity Credit Corporation would not be changed at this time. At the close, the market was weak due to hedging and foreign firms selling new cotton. Spot prices fell by 8 points, and futures prices fell by 5 points to a gain of 3 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 3 points, and futures prices fell by 1 point. Indian cotton trading was suspended. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 17th).</p>
<p>A telegram from Mumbai also stated that the opening forecast for the 18th was 222 rupees for Bairoxi, 203 rupees for Omra, and 177 rupees for Pingur, all down 1.5 rupees.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth Inventory Continues to Increase</p>
<p>The inventory of yarn in the warehouses of the Chinese Textile Exchange as of February 16 totaled 17,810 bales, of which 10-count yarn accounted for 8,960 bales, 20-count yarn accounted for 8,500 bales, and 16-count yarn accounted for only 350 bales. The brand and count of the yarn are listed below.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods Futures Open to May and June</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market saw continued strong trading of Eastern piece goods, fine cloth, and fine twill by Tianjin dealers and local merchants. Japanese firms have opened futures to May and June. Yesterday, more than 500 packages of fine cloth with the "Longtou" brand were opened, and the price was comparable to the spot sales price. Tianjin and local dyed cloth dealers have collected nearly 1,000 pieces of spot and futures of fine cloth and fine twill. Therefore, although cotton yarn and cotton have continued to decline, market prices are still maintained strongly. Spot prices of white goods are uniformly firm. The market for Ding Biji and line tweed is gradually weakening due to seasonal factors. The price of Sijunzi Biji fell by 1.25 li per yard, and the remaining goods are also flat and weak. Local factories have continued to make frequent additions of fine cloth and fine twill to Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Anhui. Assorted goods such as pattern silk, plain silk, blue cloth, colored twill, line tweed, Biji, printed colored satin, and printed cloth are also selling well. Many Zhuang merchants from Sichuan, Yunnan, Shandong, Henan, and other places who are stationed in Shanghai have returned to their hometowns for the New Year and have not yet returned to Shanghai to handle goods. The Qingdao Textile Exchange opened the auction of standard Zhanqiao brand fine cloth from yesterday. The opening price before noon was 9.225 yuan, and the closing price was 9.275 yuan. The afternoon was flat.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Rehabilitation Bonds Soar by Three Yuan Due to Lack of Spot Circulation</p>
<p>The Unified Rising Trend Seems to be Easing Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rising trend in the Chinese Securities Exchange had stopped, and the situation tended to be hovering. Longs still have a slow exit, and although there are entries, it is not as enthusiastic as before. The transmitted news is still in a daze, and the trend may be slightly smaller. People's hearts are still strong. There are not many days left this month, and the number of accounts is still huge. According to Nos. 10 and 43, etc., constantly selling, it may not be easy to rise again temporarily. Yesterday's process, the opening people's hearts are still good, and many retail investors bought in, and Nos. 5, 6, 10 and 43, etc. sold out one after another. Although the market price slightly increased by 3-4 jiao, the situation was not振. In the second round, the above companies continued to sell, No. 11 also turned into output, and Nos. 14, 38 and 54 slightly bought in. The market situation has slowly weakened, and most of them are slightly smaller by one or two jiao. The result is still a uniform rise of 0.15 to 0.4 yuan. Only Rehabilitation Bonds have very little trading. Because there is no spot circulation outside, the shorts have to cut their losses in pain, so they have soared by three yuan. This cannot be compared with the unified public bonds on the same day. The total number of transactions was 6,915,000 yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Flour Takes a Sharp Turn Downward</p>
<p>Floating Multiples Seem to Have Abandoned the Recent Period</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, the market in each month showed a trend of initial stability followed by a sharp decline. In terms of foreign wheat quotations, Chicago's recent period remained unchanged, and the long period was good for 1 or 2 jiao. Canada's near term also remained unchanged, and the long term was good for a quarter of a jiao. When opening, the foreign wheat quotation was still stable, and the opening price was similar to the previous one. However, this month is only about a week away from the delivery time, and the floating multiple chips on the market are still prosperous. Because of the smoothness of脱手, the market turned sharply downward, falling step by step. The reason is that although the factory has recovered recently, the actual sales route is not very greedy, so it is also emphasizing reality, and the longs have to give up. The new powder in July, due to the large influx of non-industry users, the degree of decline was reversed. According to this situation, the longs may be giving up the near term and seeking the long term, and the new and old may have a gradual divergence.</p>
<p>The Stock of Wheat in Various Roads is Still Plentiful, and the 期麥 Has Fallen Sharply by About One Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's period wheat market, after opening in the morning, the near-term market was still stable due to the slight vibration of foreign wheat quotations. The long-term new wheat was soft when it opened because the weather was normal and it was beneficial to wheat seedlings. After the second round, the powder market saw a sharp decline, and the stock of wheat in various roads was quite abundant. After the Spring Festival, there was a saying that there would be a steady flow of shipments to申, so people's hearts were empty, and the decline was also strong. The trend of dumping was very smooth for the new wheat because the weather was very good, and the decline turned crazy. For example, by the close of July, the huge amount of 1.5 jiao had fallen. In the subsequent situation, if the powder sales do not improve, the near term should follow the fall, and the new wheat in June and July will be greatly related to the weather. In the spot wheat market, because the standard has fallen again, the factory has suppressed the price, and each file has fallen by 7 or 8 points again. The opening Shandong Yanghe Guandian Bengbu Zhangbaling wheat is 6.63 yuan, Dongge wheat is 6.6 yuan, Jiangbei wheat is 6.578 yuan, Suqian Yaowan wheat is 6.4 yuan, second triangular, Nanjing wheat is 6.52 yuan, 5,000 packages are handled by Fuxin, and 8,000 packages are handled by Fufeng.</p>
<p>Standard Soybean Oil Cake is Over Supplied</p>
<p>Companies and Dalian Gang Have 套出</p>
<p>The standard soybean oil cake market is affected by Dalian, and the situation is gradually weakening. Dalian's telecommunications have gradually shrunk every day, and even spot goods such as L豆 have arrived in申 in whole batches. Companies and the Dalian Gang are both套出 in the market, and the actual sales are only handled by the local merchants. 客帮 lacks whole batch sales routes. Because the non-industry囤户 also dare not collect smoothly, the standard market price has gradually fallen, and the oil beans have fallen uniformly. The standard oil is 0.7 yuan, to 0.45 yuan, the standard cake is 1.23 yuan, and the standard beans are 0.13 yuan to 0.09 yuan.</p>
<p>The Stock in Dalian is Full</p>
<p>It is Difficult to be Optimistic about the Soybean Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, under the frequent declines in Dalian, the soybean market was unanimously downstream. The price of Si Pingjie beans plummeted. Oil factories took advantage of the cheap price to buy 26 cars, and the price was 6 yuan. At the moment, according to the Dalian market, it is even more difficult to be optimistic. The reason is that the stock in the port is full, and the sales 塲 of foreign plants are temporarily suspended. The bottom goods scattered in various places are bound to catch up during this spring warming and thawing, resulting in the above situation. This city is greatly affected, and other car beans are inevitably implicated. The main reason is that the sales 塲 of oil factories, car houses and garden workshops are bound to be occupied by Northeast beans, so the market has been panicked. Yesterday, only one car of Hui溪 Kou beans was opened, one car of Dingjia Zhou beans, and 1,200 packages of Hankou Zha beans, and 300 packages of Jiujiang Chi beans.</p>
<p>He Mi is Only More Popular in Yin Yuan Demand</p>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, a total of more than 30 houses arrived from various gangs, about 6,3400 stone of goods. Among them, there were 134 houses of Bo稲, and the sales 塲 of the local merchants was still sluggish, and the 包胃 was also the same. There was a slight movement after the price was cut slightly. Tianjin, Qingdao, Xi'an and other gangs handled more than 2,000 packages of Bo稲, but the market situation was still difficult to support. As a result, the thick japonica rice continued to fall, and the Bo稲 also depreciated by 0.1 to 0.1 yuan. Du Yangjian lacked goods and had no market. Yin Yuan arrived rarely and sold well, increasing by 0.1-0.2 yuan.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, 267 ships arrived from various gangs under the river. There are quite a few ships in存under the river, and the shop stomach has not yet improved. The sales of each cargo are very small, the market shape is weak, the price of white japonica rice is weak, and the medium and low are slightly 0.1 yuan. The early rice has less goods and a flat price. Bo稲 is close to jiao, Yangjian price is jiao, Port Du Ke尖 and白元 price is weak, and the price of other goods is also weak.</p>
<p>Ke秈 Lacks Whole Batch Transactions</p>
<p>The Consignor is Discounting to Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday's Ke秈 market, although local customers continued to handle shipments, the situation was still lifeless. 客帮 Shantou is still alive, and 北洋 and Xi'an continue to handle shipments, but the number of shipments is small, and the 粤帮 with the most smooth sales is still not handling the whole ticket. It is said that the 粤省 is now well stocked and the market price has been falling step by step. Shanghai's market price is relatively high and it is still difficult to 합划, so it has not been handled for many days. 粤销 is dull, and people's hearts are more empty. The consignor, on the contrary, is full of arrival and on the way goods, intending to sell urgently, so the high rice continues to cut 0.56 points, and the medium and secondary rice is slightly 0.78 points to 0.1 points. 7,950 packages of赣米 were opened throughout the day, 150 packages of Xiang米, and there were no other transactions.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Moroccan Green Tea Sales Increase</p>
<p>The market conditions for Moroccan green tea have been unusually buoyant recently. British trading firms in this city have received news that the medium- and low-grade "Zhen Mei" teas, specifically those that sold for over 50 yuan per shipment last year and those from domestic sources at 30+ yuan, are now selling very well in the market. Furthermore, items such as "Zhen Mei" and "Xiu Mei" teas are also being actively traded. The price of "Zhu Cha" tea is also quite firm. However, high-grade "Zhen Mei" tea is experiencing slow sales due to the poor market conditions. It is feared that goods priced around 100 yuan in the Shanghai market will be difficult to move.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>

<h3>Discussion Pending on Relief Goods for American Disaster, Receipt of Telegraph Indicates Adequate Distribution</h3>

<h3>British Firm Marconi &amp; Co. Secures Entire Guangzhou Water Plant Project</h3>
<p>Construction Cost of HK$2.8 Million; Entire Project to be Completed Within One Year</p>
<p>Last year, newspapers reported that the Guangzhou Municipal Government's massive project to expand the Guangzhou Water Plant, valued at 3.15 million yuan, was contracted to the British firm Marconi &amp; Co. It is now known that the formal contract for this project has recently been signed. The two parties signing the contract are Marconi &amp; Co. and Guangzhou Mayor Zeng Yangfu. It is understood that the project will commence shortly and, upon completion, will be one of the leading water plants in East Asia, boasting unparalleled and comprehensive facilities. The various features of the plant are briefly described below:</p>
<p>New Plant Location</p>
<p>The plant will be rebuilt on the original site of the old plant along the Pearl River in Zengbu. The content includes a power generation room, water intake room, sedimentation room, clean water reservoir, and twelve Shanghai water pools. The daily output will reach 30 million gallons, which will be sufficient to meet the maximum drinking water needs of all residents in Guangzhou. To further ensure the enterprise's success, a large reservoir with a capacity of 2.5 million gallons is being built in the urban area of Guangzhou to prevent unforeseen circumstances. Guangzhou is situated near mountains and rivers, boasting exceptional scenic beauty. The project planners are taking advantage of this natural terrain to construct another reservoir on the mountains near the city, using</p>
<p>Natural Pressure</p>
<p>to supply water to tall buildings throughout the city without the aid of pumps. If pumps were required to achieve the desired water pressure throughout Guangzhou, the number needed and their value would be substantial. This design will greatly benefit the future of the new plant. The plant is equipped with three high-pressure water pumps for pumping water into the city and three low-pressure pumps for drawing water from the river. One of the most innovative aspects is that the entire plant will be managed by</p>
<p>Mechanical Management</p>
<p>without any manual labor. All twelve filter pools will be managed from a central control point but can also be managed separately. Each filter pool is equipped with an automatic recorder to indicate the water quality status. Managers can see the conditions at a glance. The plant recognizes that</p>
<p>Water Disinfection</p>
<p>is of paramount importance to public health. Therefore, this aspect was given special attention during planning. Two modern, state-of-the-art chlorine disinfection machines are installed, with one used for disinfection and the other serving as a backup in case of damage to the primary machine, ensuring that disinfection is not interrupted and preventing unsanitary drinking water. The meticulousness and detail are evident. A 42-inch trunk pipe is one of the most</p>
<p>Important Equipment</p>
<p>This pipe is essential for connecting the water plant to the upper reservoir, allowing it to connect to the city's water pipe network in the future. In addition to a two-story office building, the plant will have all necessary facilities such as a chemical testing laboratory, repair room, and warehouse. This massive project is limited to completion within one year, with water output required by the summer of next year. The primary steel frame drawings for the project have been completed by Marconi &amp; Co. Marconi &amp; Co. previously completed a large water plant project for the Macau Water Company. The Guangzhou water plant project will be handled by the same machinery, technicians, and staff used in the Macau water plant project, ensuring a smooth and rapid completion. The Guangzhou water plant</p>
<p>Total Cost</p>
<p>is HK$2.8 million, including £81,000 for the purchase of machinery and filtration equipment. Marconi &amp; Co. plans to send a specialist to England soon to inspect the various components. The signing of this contract is a testament to the strong Sino-British relations and demonstrates cooperative progress.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Concludes Yangtze River Navigation Conference</h3>
<p>Branch Managers Gather in Shanghai, Shallow Water Fees Reduced by 15-50%</p>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had a successful year in shipping last year, generating substantial profits. The Yangtze River route, in particular, saw an exceptionally high volume of goods. To further develop the business, Cai Zengji, Shen Zhongyi, Lao Mian, and other general and deputy managers convened a conference on the 15th of this month in Shanghai, inviting branch managers from various ports along the Yangtze River to discuss</p>
<p>Development of Yangtze Business</p>
<p>Branch managers who responded to the call to attend the conference in Shanghai included Yin Huichang from Hankou, Shen Huating from Jiujiang, Tan Shulian from Anqing, Wen Quyuan from Wuhu, Shi Fuchang from Nanjing, Xin Yaoxiang from Zhenjiang, Yang Yunhe from Changsha, and Xu Rendong from Shashi. They have all arrived in Shanghai to attend the conference. Starting this week, General Manager Cai Zengji will chair the meetings, with department heads and branch managers attending to discuss the development of Yangtze River operations. At that time, the</p>
<p>Managers of Each Branch Proposed Many Motions</p>
<p>Which, when summarized, primarily focused on the congestion of goods on the Yangtze River and the company's lack of ships, with insufficient tonnage to allocate, preventing full cargo capacity. New ships must be built first to replenish the Yangtze River route. Additionally, local lighters are old and have small capacities, requiring the construction of new lighters to be deployed in Anqing, Datong, Wuhu, and Wuxue. Furthermore, with the daily congestion of goods to and from various ports along the Yangtze River, new warehouses must be added. Also, new ships must be built on the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River to connect navigation and expand business, etc. Many motions were made and, after</p>
<p>Three Days of Discussion</p>
<p>The proposals for adding ships, building lighters, constructing warehouses, and developing business were all passed. Several cases are still pending. The Yangtze River conference concluded yesterday, and the resolutions will be implemented gradually. The branch managers from various locations along the Yangtze River are still in Shanghai and are expected to return to their respective bureaus in Jing, Wu, Wan, Xun, Han, Sha, and Yi in the next day or two. Due to rising water levels upstream and downstream, the Hunan route is now open. The six companies agreed to reduce shallow water fees between Shanghai and Hankou by 10% from today. The shallow water fees on the Changsha line will also be reduced by 50%.</p>
<h3>Public Welfare Yarn Factory Workers Strike Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Schedules Mediation for This Morning</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the Public Welfare Yarn Factory at 150 Labor Sheng Road in West Shanghai recently eliminated some work in the cone winding section, laying off all 300+ workers, which caused a reaction from the workers who demanded to be reinstated. Otherwise, they would want to be paid six months' worth of severance pay, but this was not accepted by the factory management, which has been delayed for an unresolved amount of time. The 400+ workers in the roving and spinning rooms of the factory declared a strike in unison at 6:00 AM yesterday to show their support, and all work was stopped. However, the weaving mill section still operates normally. After the workers went on strike, they elected four representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. Wang Xianqing, director of the mediation section of the third department, received them and immediately dispatched staff member Zhang Chuqiang to mediate with the factory in the afternoon. The responsible representatives of the employees then went to the City Party Headquarters to petition, making mediation impossible. Inquiries were made to the factory to find out the truth, and it was said that the cone winding section was a contracted system, and the factory only had relations with the foremen, while all the workers were not directly employed by the factory, and it was really impossible to pay severance pay. However, in order to alleviate the suffering of the workers, they were allowed to be paid for a month or two. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau has decided to send representatives from the Party Department to mediate again this morning to solve the matter as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Workers at New Yu No. 1 Factory Resumed Work Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, workers in the fine spinning room of the New Yu Textile Company No. 1 Factory at 37 Suzhou Road in West Shanghai went on strike at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday because they wanted the factory to add double pay for the New Year and rest time, but this was not done. After the strike workers were persuaded by members sent by the labor union, they resumed work yesterday morning. The questions required will be negotiated directly with the factory to find a solution.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Member of the Central Committee, Wang Chonghui, went to Beijing a few days ago to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and originally planned to return to Shanghai after the closing. It is learned that Wang felt slightly unwell after arriving in Beijing, so he returned to Shanghai by night express train yesterday morning, and then went to see a doctor for treatment. After his body is fully recovered, he will go to Beijing again.</p>
<h3>He Zhuguo Passed Through Shanghai and Entered Beijing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>He Zhuguo, who went south a few days ago to report on the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu to the Central Government, flew from Beijing to Hangzhou on the 15th, and then went to Fenghua Xikou via the Fengxin Highway on the 16th to meet Zhang Xueliang, who was in seclusion, and inquire about his daily life. On the 17th, he took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Jiangtian Wheel to Shanghai and arrived here yesterday morning. It is heard that He has entered Beijing that day, and will visit Chairman Chiang and Minister He again to ask about the issue of the defense area of the Northeast Army. He plans to stay in Shaanxi and Beijing for a while, and then return to the road.</p>
<h3>Shou Jingwei Returned to Shanghai Yesterday to Advance to Beijing Again</h3>
<p>Preparing to Establish a China Tea Company, Going to Anhui, Jiangxi, and Other Provinces to Contact</p>
<p>In order to develop Chinese tea, the Ministry of Industry plans to establish the China Tea Company and jointly organize it with the authorities of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian and other provinces. The total amount of capital is set at 2 million yuan in national currency, and Shou Jingwei is entrusted to prepare everything. The articles of association have been drafted and announced in Beijing. Shou was in Beijing before, asking the Ministry for instructions on everything, and the case has been completed. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning, and still took the night express train to Beijing that night. According to him, after going to Beijing, he will set off to contact various places the next day, first going to Anhui, and then to Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai in two weeks. The authorities of all provinces have replied by telegram expressing their approval. After returning to Shanghai from various places, I will discuss the division of labor and cooperation and the development of tea export trade with Chinese and foreign tea merchants in Shanghai. The general company will be established in Shanghai, and is expected to be established in two months.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry sent a telegram to the chairmen of the governments of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces: "Dear brother ××, I would like to ask you to help me. Tea is a major national product and is world-renowned, but the tea varieties are not improved, the manufacturing methods are not improved, the quality is getting worse, the standards are not followed, and the transportation and management are not proper, resulting in overseas sales being encroached upon and the number of exports is decreasing every year. In recent years, officials and people in tea-producing provinces have asked for ways to improve in order to provide relief. After repeated research by the Ministry, we have drafted a method to initiate the organization of a China Tea Company jointly run by officials and businessmen in tea-producing provinces and regions, and officials and people will work together to improve the production, manufacture, transportation and sales of tea, so as to promote overseas trade. A member of the Economic Construction General Association and Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Shou Jingwei, has been specially dispatched to visit your province with a draft of the articles of association for a detailed explanation. If you agree, you plan to set up a preparatory committee and appoint the directors of the construction halls of the six provinces and the directors of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, Shou Wei Chang, and others, nine people, as members of the preparatory committee, to prepare and proceed together. It is also planned to ask your province to undertake 40,000 yuan in shares, half of which can be raised by your province to solicit business shares and urge tea merchants and financiers to share them, and pay the shares in two installments. Only one-half of the shares will be collected at the beginning of the operation, in order to make it easier for everyone to lift and plan for progress. This is a special message, and I hope to reply by telegram. Minister of Industry, Wu Dingchang, fish tap,</p>
<h3>Inner River Steamer Liheng Sunk by Waves</h3>
<p>Salvage Operation is Underway</p>
<p>After the Inner River China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau was ordered to suspend operations, all the small steamers and company ships on the Su, Song, Tai, Hang, Jia and Hu lines have been successively taken over by the bureau and opened to Shanghai. Fourteen small steamers and thirteen company ships have arrived in Shanghai and are all stopped in Longhua and other places. There are still five small steamers and five company ships in the Zhenjiang Huaiyang area, and Bureau member Qian Xiangshan has been sent to take over them and will arrive in Shanghai soon. When all arrive, they will be sold by bid. One of the small steamers that has arrived in Shanghai, Li Heng, was anchored in Yangsi Port. The wind and waves were quite strong the day before, and the Li Heng's hull was overwhelmed by the waves and water entered, and the ship sank into the port. After the watchman reported to the bureau, staff have been sent to verify that it is true, and salvage operations are underway.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Company Sets Up Station in Nanzheng</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1390: "Now approved, Eurasia Airlines函略开, by the order of the Ministry, a station will be set up in Nanzheng (Hanzhong). Every shift of planes will stop at this station. However, Hanzhong's terrain is mountainous, and the airport is like in an urn. If the weather is bad, it cannot land at all. At that time, the mail to the station will have to be taken to the next station, and then taken back when the plane returns, until it can land, in order to ensure safety, etc., it is approved. This notice is given to everyone to know about it. This notice, Director Zha Peilin, February 17th."</p>
<h3>National Sugar Production and Sales Association Asks to Change the Sugar Ball Tax Rate</h3>
<p>More than Half Lower Than White Sugar, Damaging Tariffs and National Sugar</p>
<p>Last year, 269,835 dans of sugar were smuggled in North China. The loss of national tax was very large, and because China's investigation and suppression was severe, it was not satisfied. Recently, the China National Sugar Production and Sales Association reported that Qingdao investigators from the Shandong Puyi Sugar Factory reported that various sugar balls were transported from Dalian to Qingdao in large numbers, with different colors and patterns. This kind of goods is said to be made of coarse sugar, and the local price in Dalian is about 9 yuan per 100 kilograms. Qinghai Customs estimates that the tax is 4.15 yuan per 100 kilograms, plus a surtax of 14.15 yuan, totaling 4.565 yuan per gold unit, which is about 10.045 yuan in national currency. Compared with the import tax of white sugar, it is more than half lower. If it is allowed to be imported, it will reduce tariff revenue and affect the sales of national sugar. The impact is not light. After the China National Sugar Production and Sales Association received the report, they believed that since the sugar balls are condensed from coarse sugar, the substance is only different in size from the coarse sugar, and there is no difference. It is obviously intentional to confuse and try to trick tariffs, so the association has presented to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the tariff on the sugar balls be levied according to the coarse sugar tax rate in order to maintain tax revenue and national sugar.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Tea Export Statistics</h3>
<p>The Total Number Has Increased Compared to the Previous Year, Brick Tea Exports Have Greatly Declined</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin She, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau announced that the total amount of Chinese tea exported from Shanghai in 1936 (including Hankou tea, which was transshipped through Shanghai) was 297,174.76 quintals, which is still far behind the 73,000 quintals in 1934, but it increased by more than 6,800 quintals compared with 1935, which shows that the external export of Chinese tea has turned to a path of recovery, but the future still needs the efforts of the tea industry. As far as the export status of various teas is concerned, the export of red tea, green tea and other teas have increased compared with 1935, especially the increase in green tea is the largest. It is found that the export of green tea to Africa was very prosperous last year, and it is the only market for Chinese green tea today. Its development is just beginning, but it is said that green tea from a certain country is trying to seize the market there, and has recently used dumping policies to actively develop sales. This is very worthy of the attention of our tea industry. As for the export of brick tea, it has greatly declined. It is found that brick tea is mostly transported to the Soviet Union. In recent years, the Soviet Union has also had large-scale tea operations, and it is gradually becoming self-sufficient. The loss of this major customer has a great impact on Chinese tea.</p>
<h3>National Handicraft Exhibition</h3>
<p>Exhibits Sent from All Parties are Reviewed by the Organizing Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government received a letter from the National Economic Construction Movement Committee for the organization of a national handicraft exhibition, and the solicitation of exhibits was ordered by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to set up an office to solicit various handicrafts from national product manufacturers in Shanghai. According to news from the Social Affairs Bureau, since the start of solicitation, the applicants from all parties have been very enthusiastic. As it concerns the national industry, the bureau will organize a review committee to carefully review the exhibits sent by all parties. It was originally planned to hold a preview in mid-March, but it is feared that the time will be too late, or after sending to Beijing to participate in the exhibition, the national exhibits will be transported to Shanghai for a second national handicraft exhibition.</p>
<h3>Chinese Representatives to Participate in the International Textile Industry Conference Will Soon Be Selected</h3>
<p>All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and Other Organizations Will Hold a Meeting on the 21st to Invite Textile Industry Leaders to Discuss Everything</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the International Textile Industry Tripartite Conference convened by the International Labor Bureau is scheduled to be held in Washington, DC on April 2. China has been invited to participate. The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the General Federation of Industry will invite textile industry leaders to discuss everything on the 22nd. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Scheduled Discussion</p>
<p>After receiving the order from the Ministry of Industry, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce planned to invite all relevant parties to discuss the selection of representatives. Yesterday, it received an order from the Ministry of Industry stating that the US ambassador had sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs inviting participation, and US Ambassador Johnson personally invited Foreign Minister Zhang Qun to select representatives as soon as possible. Therefore, the association, together with the General Federation of Industry of China, will hold a meeting at the Bank Association at noon on the 22nd, inviting textile giants to discuss. According to Lin Kanghou, who told reporters that the meeting time is approaching, and everything must be done as soon as possible, so textile industry leaders are specially invited to discuss the delegation of representatives and other issues. It is heard that Wang Zhisheng, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, took the night express train to Beijing last night to visit the officials of the Ministry of Industry to ask for instructions on everything.</p>
<p>Instruction from the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The instruction from the Ministry of Industry to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is as follows: "According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' letter No. 1279 of January 10, 1937, the US ambassador's letter states: 'When the International Labor Conference holds its 30th session, the US representative proposed to convene a tripartite meeting of the international textile industry to discuss ways to improve the social problems involved in the textile industry, which has been approved by the conference, and the International Labor Bureau has resolved that the meeting will be held in Washington on April 2, 1937. The Chinese government is specially invited to send representatives to participate,' etc. Subsequently, US Ambassador Johnson invited the Minister in person to send representatives and technical experts to participate in the meeting, and said, 'The US government firmly believes that China's textile industry is an important part of the national economy, so it is very willing for the Chinese government to participate in the meeting,' etc. Whether China should send representatives to participate in the meeting, please check and reply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for processing, etc. It is approved. It is found that this case has been notified to the association before, and it has been approved that the association, together with the China General Federation of Industry, should select representatives in accordance with the usual practice, and raise the attendance expenses on its own. Therefore, it should immediately determine the candidate list of representatives and submit it to the Ministry for review and handling. This is a special notice."</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Guild and Others Petition to Maintain the Original Plan for Clothing Regulations Regarding Robes and Mandarin Jackets</h3>
<p>Will Send Representatives to Petition in the Capital</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Guild, the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Factory Industry Guild, on behalf of overseas Chinese Chen Jiageng, petitioned the Ministry of Interior to abolish robes and mandarin jackets in the Clothing Regulations, requesting a re-amendment, believing it is greatly related to the national economy and people's livelihood. They first telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Industry, saying: "To President Chiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Chiang of the Ministry of Interior, and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, Your Excellencies: We have found that men's and women's formal and casual wear have already been clearly stipulated in the Clothing Regulations by Your Ministries. The use of domestic materials for casual wear was also clearly promulgated by the National Government on April 16, 1929. Since its implementation, the people have found it convenient, and our government has repeatedly emphasized and earnestly promoted it. However, recent newspapers have reported that some people, with a biased view and seeking novelty, have petitioned Your Ministries to re-regulate men's and women's formal and casual wear. Upon hearing this news, we are deeply concerned about the national economy and people's livelihood and cannot help but tremble. According to the reasons they have stated, they say that long robes and mandarin jackets are remnants of the Qing Dynasty's clothing system, and continuing to follow and use them will indeed affect national psychology and hinder national rejuvenation. However, Dr. Sun Yat-sen created the Republic, uniting the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan peoples into one family. The Han and Tang clothing of our country in the past are not suitable for modern times. Therefore, incorporating habits and considering domestic products, long robes and mandarin jackets are suitable for the colors of the Eastern nation. If it is said that the Manchu legacy affects national psychology, it is tantamount to rejecting the Manchu people from the nation, regarding Manchuria as not our country's territory, and cutting off the Manchu people's psychology of revolting against the Qing and returning to the Republic. Therefore, wearing robes and mandarin jackets has no impact on psychology. If it is said to hinder national rejuvenation, then the clothing systems of various countries have their own special circumstances and their own national products. During the Meiji Restoration in Japan, everything was reformed, but the kimono with wide sleeves and wooden clogs remained the same and did not hinder its rise and strength. Our country's silk has a long history and culture and is a sideline of agriculture. Using it for formal wear is dignified and solemn, and using it for casual wear is luxurious and comfortable. It can express the spirit of the country and promote natural domestic products. Therefore, the revival of the nation depends on this. Wearing robes and mandarin jackets is precisely for the purpose of reviving the nation and does not hinder it in any way. As for the inconvenience of movement and work compared to short clothes, formal wear values solemnity and does not prioritize convenience. Casual wear also follows each person's habits. Even if it needs to be slightly modified, it should be based on domestic products. At a time when national silk is declining and foreign goods are being dumped, the government is doing its best to promote it for the sake of the country and the people. It is already worried about the influx of foreign materials, so how can we not consider the root and address the symptoms, and further obstruct and lead to decline? Your Ministries have great wisdom and comprehensive planning, and will strive to take the lesser of two evils and choose the greater of two benefits. You will not be alarmed by alarming words and disregard the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, we especially telegraph to request the maintenance of the original plan for clothing regulations. The future of the nation and the vitality of domestic products truly depend on it. We are deeply concerned and await your orders. Luo Qinghua, Chairman of the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Guild; Cai Shengbai, Chairman of the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Factory Industry Guild, bow and sigh." It is heard that the guild has nominated representatives such as Luo Qinghua and will soon go to the capital to petition.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Statement</h3>
<p>Rumors of Road Worker Layoffs Are Inaccurate</p>
<p>The Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Secretary-General's Office issued a message stating that the Chinese newspapers in this city had previously published news about the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Works Department laying off road workers, and that the details were largely inconsistent with the facts. The Shanghai Municipal Council officially issued a statement to correct the following:</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, a message was published in the Chinese newspapers, saying that 90% of the road workers employed by the Public Works Department of this Council would be eliminated. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, the newspapers also published that this Council would draw lots to reduce road workers on February 28th, etc. All these details are completely inaccurate.</p>
<p>This Council has not yet discussed laying off road workers. The above news can be believed to have been fabricated by certain individuals who falsely claimed that this Council would lay off workers and made concessions after negotiations, with the intention of defrauding money from the workers.</p>
<p>As for the details about working hours and wages reported in the newspapers, they are also inconsistent with the facts. The actual working hours for workers are 8.5 hours per day in winter and 9 hours per day in summer. The wages for first-class workers are 65 cents per day. Half pay is given for two days or holidays when no work is done, and full pay is given when work is done. The Spring Festival is closed for three days each year, and the Dragon Boat Festival is closed for one day. Full wages are given for each holiday, and double wages are given for those who work as usual. This is the actual situation.</p>

Recently, his second daughter-in-law, Yu Zhan Yijuan, hired lawyer Jiang Pingfan to sue the District Court to order her husband's brother, Yu Muhun, to hand over the accounts for inspection in order to divide the property. The court hearing was held at 3:00 PM yesterday. The plaintiff, Yu Zhan Yijuan, stated that she married the defendant's younger brother, Qingsheng, through a matchmaker. Unfortunately, her husband passed away the year after her father-in-law died. Therefore, the ancestral Shanghai Xiaonanmen outside Sangyuan Street Yu Youyuan Ink Factory and real estate, Guangzhou Cao Sugong Ink Shop, and three buildings and land in Hejianong Lane inside Shanghai Xiaoximen, and three buildings and land in Dalin Road Gu Sanli, and the money deposited in banks and money shops, are all managed by her husband's brother, Yu Muhun. He moved to a new house with his wife and wasted money at will, abandoning the plaintiff. She also heard that the defendant had moved all the important books and documents to other places, clearly intending to conceal or alter them. She requested that the court order him to hand them over. The defendant also hired Wu Zhiping and Fang Jiazhen as lawyers to appear in court and argued that the defendant felt very strange after receiving the summons. It is said that she asked me to hand over the books. After checking, the family affairs of the deceased father were managed by his mother, and I have other jobs outside. I am currently working at Ewo Yanghang. I don’t know anything about the inheritance. There was no will when my father died, so I was entrusted to manage it. What should I hand over, so I ask for the original lawsuit to be rejected. The official asked why your wife, Ms. Sinaiyan, did not appear in court. He replied, "First, she is old, and second, she is more depressed after the lawsuit, so she is bedridden." The official ordered that you must tell your mother to come to court next time. This case is adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Younger Brother Steals, Older Sister Asks for Additional Punishment</h3>
<p>Misled by Bad Friends, Stole Legal Tender and Gold Jewelry; Judge Tried to Persuade to Withdraw the Complaint, But the Sister Refused</p>
<p>Xu Yuehua, a female student at the Aesthetic Girls' Middle School from Hangzhou, is 21 years old and lived with her mother in her hometown. Because she came to Shanghai to study, she came to Shen with her younger brother, Xu Zhicheng (20 years old), and lived in the house of her cousin at No. 8 Tongchunfang, Lane 38, Baker Road. At 9:20 PM on the 11th, Xu Yuehua went out and returned home at about 10:00 PM. She found that her legal tender of 40 yuan and a</p>
<p>gold bracelet</p>
<p>worth 130 yuan were missing. At that time, Xu Zhicheng was also nowhere to be found. The maid told her that she had just seen Zhicheng carrying a bag out. Therefore, she was sure that Zhicheng had stolen it. Because he did not return for a long time, she reported it to the Xinzha Patrol House. Hua Detective Ye Yushan investigated and learned that Xu Zhicheng was hiding in Room 13 of the Zhonghua Hotel at No. 387 Avenue Edward VII. He went to investigate, but there was no trace of Zhicheng in the room. There were only two young men, Mao Jinmao and Hu Shijie, in the room. After questioning them, there were also</p>
<p>no clues.</p>
<p>He had to apply to the First Special District Court for an arrest warrant. Until 12:40 PM the night before last, Xu Zhicheng suddenly returned home. Xu Danhua reported it to the patrol house, and Mountain Leaf Detective brought him to the patrol house. Under questioning, he confessed that before the theft, he met Mao Jinmao and Hu Shijie at the Daxin Amusement Park. At that time, the two men said that one worked in a hotel and the other worked for the Hangyuan Railway Bureau. Under the instigation of the two men, he stole his sister's gold bracelet and legal tender. He first stayed at the Zhonghua Hotel. On the 12th, he went to</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>to play, stayed in a hotel. Mao and others stole all of Xu's legal tender and fled. He had no choice but to return home alone. The detective asked where the gold bracelet was. He replied that it had been pledged at Qingyuan Silver Shop, No. 500 Hankou Road, for 90 yuan, which was also stolen by Mao and others. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Court. Patrol House lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for theft under Articles 320 and 324 of the Criminal Law. Because the stolen goods had not yet been recovered, he</p>
<p>asked for a postponement.</p>
<p>Xu Zhicheng confessed to the theft without denial. The presiding judge, Zhan Liangce, considered that the plaintiff and the defendant in this case were siblings. Therefore, he persuaded Xu Yuehua to consider the relationship between siblings and withdraw the complaint after the defendant was reprimanded in court. However, Xu Yuehua firmly refused, saying that she was afraid that her brother's behavior would become more improper in the future and damage the reputation of her parents. Therefore, she asked the court to give him a slight punishment. At a minimum, he must be granted probation after serving his sentence. Judge Zhan then ruled that the case would be adjourned for two days for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Qian Chengxu Talks About Bata's Mission to China</h3>
<p>Large-Scale Purchase of Chinese Shoe Materials and Establishment of a Large Shoe Factory in Shanghai</p>
<p>New Sound News Agency reports: Bata, the world's shoe king, set off from Zilin, Czech Republic, last December with his secretary, engineers, and more than a dozen other people on a private plane. He then inspected the business of his branches in South Africa and Morocco. He recently arrived in Hong Kong from Singapore and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at dawn on the 21st of this month. He is scheduled to stay at the International Hotel. Qian Chengxu, the manager of the China Machine Shoe Factory, will host a reception for Bata on the 24th to renew old friendships. According to Qian, Bata's mission to China this time is: First, the price of cotton and silk fabrics in the Czech Republic is expensive, and the shoe materials required are very uneconomical to purchase in Europe. This time, he will purchase Chinese silk and cotton fabrics on a large scale, or sign long-term supply contracts with Chinese factories. The turnover will be at least 400,000 yuan per year. Second, Bata has been actively attacking the American shoe market since 1934. Now, the Czech Republic has no sea transportation exports and must borrow from neighboring countries, which is very inconvenient in terms of transportation and causes a lot of business losses. Therefore, he recently plans to set up a large shoe factory with a capital of more than 5 million yuan in Shanghai, purchase a large number of cheap Chinese leather, silk, and cotton shoe-making materials, and dump them on the American market, preparing to hold the key to the world's shoe industry. In this regard, the China Machine Shoe Factory currently produces 250 pairs of Zhongzi shoes per day, and will soon have more than 1,000 pairs. With this foundation, future cooperation between the two parties is actually possible. The establishment of the China Machine Shoe Factory in those days was remotely due to his visit to the Bata Shoe Factory in the past. It is said that Bata will be delayed for three days after arriving in China and will have to go to Japan and transfer to the United States to return home.</p>
<h3>Dasheng Hospital Abortion Case, Police Request Severe Punishment</h3>
<p>The Court Heard the Case Yesterday and Scheduled Sentencing</p>
<p>Li Jingzhen, a local woman from Shaoxing, who lived at No. 97 Yongyuli, Beile Road, was 25 years old. Because Wen Gui often did business in Tianjin, Jingzhen lived in Shanghai and had an affair with Shen Fusheng, and built another golden house at No. 673 Baoxingli, Beile Road. Because she was four months pregnant, she went to Dasheng Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital at No. 200 Sapesai Road on the afternoon of the 4th of this month through the introduction of her girlfriend Xue Kebin and asked for an abortion. Due to poor surgical skills,</p>
<p>Internal Injuries</p>
<p>she died. The French Patrol House arrested the female doctor Yan Pinzheng, the nurse Gu Shaoqin, and Xue Kebin, who introduced and helped with the abortion, and sent them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. The body was sent to the coroner's office for an autopsy. The reports have been published in this newspaper many times. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Shuoying of the Second Special Court continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Gu Shouxu, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case and prosecuted the three defendants for the crime of</p>
<p>performing an abortion for profit</p>
<p>resulting in death under Article 290, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. When asked, the defendant Yan Pinzheng said that the deceased had an abortion elsewhere. Because the placenta was falling, she came to my place to ask for treatment. She was bleeding non-stop, and it was not me who performed the abortion. Gu Shaoqin said, "I only helped to get the instruments and did not do anything." Xue Kebin denied that the deceased and her uncle came to my door and asked me to go out. The deceased said that she was bleeding due to a collision that damaged her pregnancy and asked me to</p>
<p>accompany her to the hospital.</p>
<p>I accompanied her and did not help with the abortion. Then, the witness Hu Chenshi (the second landlord in the small house) testified that the deceased said a week ago that she was going to have an abortion. I tried to dissuade her. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, she came with Miss Xue and said to me again that she was going to have an abortion today. According to her, she had already had a physical examination at the hospital and it was okay to have an abortion. At that time, only two injections were needed and the fetus would come down without any danger. She also said that Miss Xue had had an abortion before. At that time, Xue was also nearby saying that there was no danger in having an abortion. Then,</p>
<p>I, the deceased's</p>
<p>uncle, Xue Xiao, and the deceased took a rickshaw to Dasheng Hospital. The doctor and Miss Xue and the other three put on white clothes and started working. They told me to go back, so I went home. At 12:00 at night, I was not feeling well, so I asked my sister Xia Chenshi to visit. At 6:00 the next morning, someone from the hospital came to inform me that the deceased was dead. I also asked the deceased's family's maid, Chu Zhang, who said that I knew that the mistress was pregnant and had not had a miscarriage. On the afternoon of the 4th, I went out with Miss Xue.</p>
<p>People are very good.</p>
<p>On the 5th, Miss Xue and people from the hospital came together and said that the mistress was dead. At that time, they did not say anything about the abortion. At this point, the court considered that the case was clear and ordered the opening of the debate. Gu Shouxu, a lawyer from the Medical Office, argued that according to the testimony of the price check and the treaders, the defendant did intend to make a profit by performing an abortion, resulting in death. Although the defendants denied the abortion, there were still blood stains on the copied instruments, and the forensic doctor verified that the deceased's</p>
<p>Uterus</p>
<p>had many internal injuries. Although the defendants are trying to deny it, the facts are all there, so they should be severely punished according to the law. The second and third defendants should also be sentenced to criminal punishment according to the law for helping and constituting the crime of causing death. In recent years, I don’t know how many people have died in society due to abortions. There are also cases where hospitals are used to make profits by performing abortions, causing ignorant women to die prematurely. If we do not punish them severely, how can we warn the future? Then, after the defendants’ lawyers, Lan Xuzhang and Wang Shizong, defended them, the court debate ended and the defendants were ordered to be remanded to custody for sentencing on the morning of the 22nd.</p>

<h3>Chen Yunlong Attempted to Rape Daughter, Failed</h3>
<p>Falsely Accused Lin Li</p>
<p>Mao Ye, a woman from Haimen, 48 years old, lives in the front building at No. 244 Fuyou Road in the city. She only has one daughter, named Xiufen, who is now 20 years old and unmarried. Chen Yunlong, a 22-year-old man from Rugao who lives in the rear building of the house, coveted Xiufen. However, the girl was as cold as ice. It happened that Mao Ye returned to her hometown for business. Chen Yunlong thought it was an opportunity and was extremely daring. Late at night on the 13th of this month, he tiptoed into Xiufen's room and, while the girl was asleep, uncovered the quilt and attempted to rape her. Xiufen woke up from her sleep and immediately shouted for help. Neighbors heard the sound and went to inquire. Chen saw that things were not going well and slipped away. Yesterday, Mao Ye returned to Shanghai and Xiufen cried and told her what happened. Ms. Mao then dragged Chen Yunlong to the Yi Miao Police Station. According to the defendant, he confessed that because he could not hook up with her, the landlady (Lin Li) taught me to first commit adultery. If she becomes pregnant, she will be a matchmaker for me and I will not be afraid of failure. Then, Lin Li was summoned and said that she did not instigate him and was falsely accused. The case was related to the attempted rape and was sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Nun from Xiaochang Temple Sues for Selling Temple Property</h3>
<p>Ni Juehui, the abbess of Xiaochang Temple in Zhenru Town, 61 years old, from Yangzhou, hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the District Court against Jin Ouyang, the wife of the deceased temple director Jin Souxia, and Li Dianliang, Li Boyin, Lu Xiqing, Li Mao, Yang Rulin, Pu Shaoting, and the bailiff Li Baosheng, for stealing and encroaching on the ancient temple property, stating that there were temple properties including ten diagrams of land, twelve plots of Tangziwei, and 3.75 acres of land owned by Master Faming. She has been in charge of the land. Because of the January 28th Shanghai War, she asked the temple director Jin Souxia to take care of the land deed. After Jin passed away, the plaintiff repeatedly asked Jin's wife for it without success. Therefore, she investigated the Land Bureau and discovered that the seven defendants colluded with the bailiff Li Baosheng to stamp the seal and privately sold it to the municipal government for 3,690 yuan. She requested investigation and prosecution, and attached a civil lawsuit. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiangzu held a court hearing. The plaintiff asked the proxy lawyer to state the case. The defendant, Jin Ouyang, Buddhist, who lives at No. 26 Chuanxin Street, said that Xiaochang Temple is a family temple. The land belongs to my family. The Fang Dan has been in charge of it since my late husband. The three acres of land were purchased by the municipal government. On December 12th last year, we seven people received it. The money is deposited with me and is prepared to be used to rebuild the temple. Li Dianliang said that because the temple was destroyed, we seven leaders initiated the reconstruction in the 19th year. The Juehui has not lived in the temple. The bailiff Li Baosheng admitted to stamping the seal, and the statements of Li Boyin, Lu Xi, and Pu Shaoting were similar. The court adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Hanzhong Road</h3>
<p>At about 7:00 PM the night before last, the home of Tan Jinsheng (a local), who works at the Caojiadu Cleaning Station at No. 8 Hanzhongli, Hanzhong Road, Zhabei, was suddenly visited by seven bandits dressed in miscellaneous long and short clothes with Jiangbei accents. Three of the bandits each held a pistol, threatening them not to make a sound, rummaged through boxes and cabinets, and robbed more than 80 yuan in legal tender, a gold watch, a gold chain, a Mackintosh coat, a gray squirrel fur coat, and other clothing and accessories, worth about several hundred yuan. Afterwards, the victim opened a lost list and reported it to the Xinzha Police Station under its jurisdiction, requesting the arrest of the stolen goods and the robbers.</p>
<h3>Yu Cailang's Abduction of a Maid to be Interrogated</h3>
<p>Yu Cailang, from Changshu, runs an introduction shop at No. 148 North Zhejiang Road. He has a concubine named Mao Qiaoxian from Wuxi. She used to work at the home of Jiang Wu, a woman from Nanjing at No. 15, Lane 548, Bazilu, but quit due to some reason. On January 28th, Yu Cailang instigated Mao Qiaoxian to go to Jiang's house on the pretext of taking a lost scarf and took the opportunity to lure her 14-year-old maid Yao Jinfeng out and send her to the Shi family, a relative of Qiaoxian, in Xinzhen, Chongming Second District, in an attempt to sell her for profit. The case was discovered by Hua Detective Wang Runhe from the Hongkou Patrol House, who arrested Yu Cailang and Mao Qiaoxian one after another and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yao Jinfeng did not want to return to her hometown with her father Yao Peijin and her employer Jiang Wu, and was willing to study at the Jiliang Institute. The court ordered the Jiliang Institute to submit a charter. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, said that a female staff member of the Institute was present in court, and then submitted a summary. After inspecting it, the court found that it was not a detailed summary. Lawyer Zhang said that the standard of the Institute was the Western version, so he did not bring the case. He questioned the two defendants, who continued to shirk responsibility. Judge Xiao ordered them to be remanded to custody to await sentencing. The part about Yao was ordered to be submitted to the court for verification by the Jiliang Institute with the Western version.</p>

<h3>Yang Yunshi's Sons Sue for Division of Maternal Grandfather's Estate</h3>
<p>Yunshi's wife was the eldest daughter of Li Jingfang. The result of the trial was that Yang's sons and others won the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Yang Yunshi, also known as Qi, a secretary-general to Wu Peifu formerly, and a native of Changshu, married Guo Yao, the eldest daughter of Li Jingfang (Zi Boxing), a former Qing Dynasty notable.

<h3>The Result of Self-Degradation</h3>
<p>Bao Zhangshi (65 years old), an old woman from Danyang in the back grass shed of Tiantongli, Zhabei, had a son, Bao Xiangwei, 26 years old, who had received secondary education. He used to be an employee of a commercial firm but was prone to extravagance and wasteful spending. He embezzled several thousand yuan in account funds. The owner of the firm discovered his fraudulent behavior and dismissed him, pursuing the guarantor for the account funds. Bao's son became unemployed and lived off his savings. He became addicted to bad habits, willingly engaged in debauchery, and was avoided by relatives and friends. His life was extremely poor. In the spring of last year, it was heard that he had become a beggar, begging on the streets during the day to fill his stomach, and sleeping under the overpass of Cun Deli on Limin Road at night, suffering from cold and hunger and falling ill. His mother, Bao Zhangshi, ignored him. He eventually died of his illness late the night before last. In the morning, someone discovered it and reported it to the police station. The police were ordered to report to the local court. Yesterday afternoon at about 4:00 PM, the prosecutor was dispatched to the scene to examine the body. Because the deceased's mother, Bao Zhangshi, could not afford a coffin, the charity provided a coffin for burial.</p>
<p>Special Item</p>
<h3>Unity and Peace – Part One</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>㊀</p>
<p>The topic of "Unity and Peace" is like a scale, with "Unity" on one side and "Peace" on the other. The word "and" in the middle is the lever of the scale, weighing the weight on both sides. What exactly is the relationship between "Unity" and "Peace"? We often hear "Peaceful Unity" and also often hear "United Peace." Both of these phrases make sense, so it can be said that "Unity" and "Peace" are of equal quality, like the fish and bear's paw that Mencius compared. If following the order in the title, we should first talk about "Unity" and then about "Peace," but because the most common and urgent need of the nation and the people right now is peace, we will talk about peace first.</p>
<p>Why is peace the most common and urgent need of the nation and the people right now? It can be explained in two points:</p>
<p>First, in terms of human nature and the national character of the Chinese people, we do indeed love peace. What is human nature? It is life, not death. Just look at the character for "nature" (性), which is composed of "heart" (心) and "life" (生). This shows that "nature" is the heart that loves to survive. "Loving life and hating death is human nature," no one can deny that. There is also an old saying: "The greatest virtue of heaven and earth is life." Heaven and earth give birth to all things, and humans are the most intelligent of all things, so of course, we should follow the greatest virtue of heaven and earth and seek to live. How can we live? I can say that we must have peace in order to live. For example, in spring, the wind is gentle and the sun is warm, and plants sprout and grow. Therefore, it is said that spring has vitality and vigor. In autumn, as soon as the autumn wind rises, the leaves of the wutong tree fall and the plants wither. Therefore, it is said that autumn has a chilling atmosphere. Plants still need gentle wind and warm sun to grow, so how can humans not hope for peace? Furthermore, in terms of the national character of the Chinese people, the Chinese are particularly fond of peace. According to China's history of several thousand years, there has never been an instance of wanting to destroy other people's countries, exterminate other people's races, or prevent people of other countries from surviving like us, unlike modern imperialism in general. Think about it, many countries have interacted with China for thousands of years, and they have never been destroyed. However, now that they interact with imperialism, their countries have already been destroyed in less than a few decades. There are many examples of this, so there is no need to list them. Just look at Korea and Annam to understand. This is enough to show that the Chinese nation has always been generous, hoping to coexist and prosper with other countries, and completely embraces the idea of a peaceful and righteous path. In ancient books, there are many teachings such as "continue the extinguished lineage, revive the destroyed country, govern chaos and maintain danger, pay tribute on time, and give generously and receive sparingly." The so-called "continue the extinguished lineage" means that we must think of ways to continue the lineages that have already been extinguished. The so-called "revive the destroyed country" means that we must revive the countries that have already been destroyed. The so-called "give generously and receive sparingly" means that we in China, regarding neighboring countries, even though they send little, we should bestow more. This spirit is completely different from the methods of imperialism. The attitude of imperialism is to squeeze and exploit, causing weak nations to be destroyed and their races exterminated, of course, including their cultures perishing together. The Chinese national character, however, cherishes the righteous path of winning people over with virtue and rejects the hegemonic path of force. Therefore, from the perspective of the national character of China, it is indeed the most fond of peace.</p>
<p>Second, from our experiences since the Xinhai Revolution and the current environment, we feel the need for peace even more. Since the Xinhai Revolution, due to the evils of the remnants of the imperial system and the division of military warlord territories, the whole country has suffered from continuous warfare for years. The people are in deep water and scorching fire, and their spirits and materials have suffered greatly from the pain of war. Who does not hope for peace and not long to transform war into peace? People share the same heart, and hearts share the same reason. They have gained enlightenment from painful experiences, believing that only peace can bring stability and prosperity, and only peace can strengthen the country and revive the nation. The painful experiences of the past have already made everyone aware of this, which is the hope for peace. Furthermore, from the perspective of the current international environment, everyone is clamoring for collective security, hoping to jointly maintain world peace. We, as a weak country, find ourselves besieged by the forces of various imperialisms, of course, even more eager to strive to create a modern nation in an environment of international peace. Without peace, of course, there is no talk of construction, and even less talk of increasing national strength, let alone resisting external oppression? Therefore, "peace" is indeed the most common and urgent need of our nation and people right now.</p>
<p>Moreover, many dangerous things in the past year have been able to turn misfortune into good fortune and danger into safety. What is the reason for this? It is because the people of the whole country have unconsciously launched a great power. Because of this great power, it can influence everything. Where does this great power come from? It comes from the great spirit of the whole nation's hope for peace. Now, our country has reached a period where it needs peace; our national history has also embarked on a period of beginning to revive. Therefore, any force that wants to hinder this trend cannot do so. Because everyone hopes for peace, society is filled with an atmosphere of peace and well-being. This country is of course thriving upward and turning to recovery; if society is full of an atmosphere of struggle, only knows resentment and violence, and does not know cooperation and coordination, then this country must be chaotic. Our China has gone through more than 20 years of the pain of war, and everyone hopes for peace. Therefore, there was a major turning point last year. The Liangguang Incident and the Xi'an Incident were able to turn danger into safety. Not only are things like this in terms of human affairs, but also in terms of heavenly timing. Agricultural production has had a good harvest, and the national economy is also expected to be thriving. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Submission</p>
<h3>Letter from Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, etc. to the Creditors of Tongyi (Continued)</h3>
<p>Thirdly, regarding the issue of funds for resumption of business, some may worry that since the company has no working capital, how can it lightly talk about resuming business? This worry is indeed valid. However, from the beginning of our mediation, we have discussed this with the debtors. At that time, we had planned to add preferred shares and bank loans. The number of preferred shares was assumed to be 640,000 yuan, which, together with the previous 1,360,000 yuan, would amount to 2,000,000 yuan, which would be the total capital of the new company. Considering that the end of the year is approaching and resumption of business must be pursued urgently, while raising funds cannot be done in a hurry, we sought a transitional method. The only way was to first contact the bank to loan 640,000 yuan, so as to free up time to calmly raise funds to repay the loan. Now, we have worked hard together with the debtors to make progress, and we have achieved results. We have already obtained the consent of major banks to jointly lend 640,000 yuan in national currency, promising to sign a contract and allocate the funds immediately after the mediation is established. Therefore, anyone who is concerned about the issue of funds for resumption of business is unaware of the truth.</p>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of mediation have been clearly explained, and the feasibility of the plan has been carefully considered. We are fair and just, so what else is there to say? However, some superficial observers may say that if the mediation is established, the debtors can avoid liability for compensation. Is the mediation plan only to help the directors and supervisors of Tongyi get out of trouble? We reply: Is helping the directors and supervisors out of trouble not also helping the creditors out of trouble? In the world, there are things that cause mutual harm and both sides lose, and there are things that coexist and prosper together. A single thought and action can determine good and evil, benefit and harm. The suffering of all beings in the final calamity is great. On a large scale, there are the disturbances in Europe, and on a small scale, there are the disputes between China and Japan. The matter of Tongyi is indeed small and insignificant, not worth mentioning. However, the kindness, meanness, forgiveness, and malice of people's hearts will also be tested here. Harmony brings auspiciousness, and anger invites disaster. Mutual understanding and concession are harmony, and mutual destruction and killing are anger. Harmony brings benefits invisibly, and anger brings harm immeasurably. The reason why we have stepped forward to mediate is that we cannot bear to see more than 6,000 creditors and the directors and supervisors of Tongyi holding each other back, going to extremes, and ultimately losing both sides. We have no love or hate in between. Moreover, the loss of the directors and supervisors is the loss of one person, while the loss of the creditors is the loss of more than 6,000 households. There must be someone who can distinguish the difference in size and weight. The so-called helping out of trouble should not be one-sided. If the strength of the directors and supervisors is in fact sufficient to compensate for the losses of the creditors, wouldn't it be simple and easy? Why bother with mediation? If not, then the creditors are merely sacrificing their energy, time, and the actual benefits of their claims, arguing with the powerless directors and supervisors over short and long, venting their anger. What is the point? The directors and supervisors of Tongyi have scattered like clouds. According to what we have heard and what the lawyers representing the creditors have learned, there are only five people in Shanghai. Among them, one is relatively wealthy, but he is old and sick, and he has many children and grandchildren. He has already divided his property seven or eight years ago, and he has very little of his own. The other four either have no property and have debts, or their debts and property are roughly offset. Those who linger in other places either have unknown residences or have long been known for their poverty. In short, none of them have the ability to be liable for compensation. Recently, the bankruptcy administrator petitioned the court to investigate the property of the directors and supervisors from various industries and shops, and to implement seizure. After months of effort, the property obtained is only worth tens of thousands of yuan, which is not even one or two percent of the total amount of debt. This is clear proof. What hope do the creditors have? After the suspension of business, the accounts have been liquidated by the liquidator and the bankruptcy administrator for more than ten years. None of the directors and supervisors have been found to be in arrears, which is hailed as rare by public opinion. It can be seen that the business failure is a public fault, not a private defect. Analyzing the term "directors and supervisors" in a general way, there are chairmen and general managers, executive directors, directors who do not perform business, and directors who are far away and never ask about things. Their natures are very different. Among them, the directors who do not ask about things should be responsible in name, but in reality, they are implicated. Their sacrifice of stocks, the loss and shelving of their own and their family's savings is pitiful. They are almost the same as the creditors. Although it can be said that their prior negligence is not excusable, however, they seem to have no shame in their conscience for compensating for the losses caused by their negligence with their own losses. Moreover, they do not receive salaries on weekdays, do not spend public funds, have obligations but no rights, specialize in bearing responsibilities, and suffer from lawsuits. They plan for the aftermath and help mediate without complaint, which can also be redeemed. Those who perform business and handle things poorly are indeed guilty and cannot argue. However, it is heard that the property of their entire family has been invested in Tongyi stocks, totaling no less than 300,000 yuan. Now, they are old and impoverished, their families are ruined, and their reputations are ruined. They are scolded by all parties and will not have a moment of peace. Their punishment is already heavy, and their illness is already deep. How can kind people bear to add insult to injury? Therefore, judging from the strength of the directors and supervisors, it is not enough to compensate. Judging from the emotions of the directors and supervisors, there is still something to be forgiven. For the sake of their own interests and for the sake of a benevolent heart, the creditors should recognize that mediation and resumption of business are the only path at present. The best strategy is to urge the directors and supervisors to quickly mediate and resume business on time, and to urge the directors and supervisors to take care of the interests of the creditors in every aspect and be careful in handling matters when implementing the mediation plan and handling the resumption of business procedures. It should be known that after the mediation is established, there are still many things that the directors and supervisors should be responsible for handling, such as the solicitation of preferred shares, the bank's loans, and the efforts to collect accounts and find ways to sell a portion of unnecessary assets at a good price, all of which are beneficial to the creditors, and are far better than urging the directors and supervisors to bear responsibilities that are beyond their capabilities and have no practical benefits. For the sake of the interests of both parties and for the sake of the entire finance, we have carefully considered and explained the facts and presented this letter. We hope that you will adopt it. We wish you all the best. (We apologize for not being able to sign each copy due to the large number of copies being printed.)

<p>Special Publication for the Third Anniversary of the New Life Movement</p>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<h3>A Retrospective on the Past Year's Work of the New Life Movement Third Anniversary Special Issue General Association</h3>
<p>— Qian Dajun</p>
<p>"Learning from the past can guide the future." As we commemorate the second anniversary of the New Life Movement, let us, with this principle in mind, conduct a concise review of the past year's work of this Association.</p>
<p>The past year's work of this Association can be roughly divided into three aspects: first, routine work; second, seasonal work; and third, other important work.</p>
<p>1. Routine Work</p>
<p>The routine work involves the continued promotion of the two movements of Orderliness and Cleanliness. The Association has formulated two routine core tasks for the New Life Movement, "namely, encompassing the Cleanliness Movement and the Orderliness Movement," and has issued them to all levels of the New Life Movement for implementation. Furthermore, in the capital, we have supervised the Capital New Life Movement Association to effectively advance these efforts.</p>
<p>2. Seasonal Work</p>
<p>The seasonal work includes: (1) Spring, Planting Movement; (2) Summer, Hygiene Movement; (3) Autumn, Thrift Movement; (4) Winter, Relief Movement.</p>
<p>(1) The Spring Planting Movement is of utmost importance and significance. However, due to the Association's relocation from Gan to Nanjing and internal reorganization, it could not be implemented.</p>
<p>(2) The Summer Hygiene Movement aims to encourage citizens to pay attention to hygiene, reduce diseases, and promote health. For the entire country, the Association pre-determined a work outline of twenty-six items. A notice was issued to New Life Movement Associations in various regions, stating that the period from May 20th to August 20th would be the duration for conducting the Summer Hygiene Movement. For each task, the steps were divided and carried out on schedule. After the notice was issued, New Life Movement Associations in various provinces, cities, and railways successively reported the establishment of Summer Hygiene Movement Committees, and submitted various regulations and implementation methods to the Association. These were all carefully reviewed, and any inconsistencies were corrected. The twenty-six items of the work outline are listed below to clarify the content: (1) Hold Summer Hygiene Movement Propaganda Week; (2) Distribute leaflets, paste slogans, and broadcast hygiene lectures; (3) Conduct a thorough cleaning; (4) Use movie theaters and slides for publicity; (5) Hold hygiene exhibitions; (6) Conduct epidemic prevention injections; (7) Disinfect public toilets; (8) Clear ponds and ditches; (9) Conduct door-to-door guidance on eliminating flies and mosquitoes; (10) Disinfect well water; (11) Promote the use of tap water; (12) Prohibit spitting; (13) Prohibit public urination and defecation; (14) Conduct hygiene guidance for hotels and apartments; (15) Conduct hygiene guidance for teahouses and restaurants; (16) Conduct hygiene guidance for entertainment venues; (17) Conduct hygiene guidance for bathhouses; (18) Conduct hygiene guidance for vegetable markets; (19) Conduct hygiene guidance for street vendors; (20) Conduct hygiene guidance for cold food shops; (21) Conduct hygiene guidance for meat shops; (22) Conduct hygiene guidance for tofu shops; (23) Conduct hygiene guidance for rickshaw pullers; (24) Conduct hygiene guidance for train stations; (25) Conduct hygiene guidance for docks.</p>
<p>For the capital, the Association dispatched personnel to join with various sectors of the capital to organize the Capital Summer Hygiene Movement Committee to carry out a large-scale hygiene movement. To meet the actual needs of summer hygiene in the capital, the following matters were undertaken: (1) Implement hygiene training for promoters and workers in various industries; (2) Hold a Hygiene Movement Propaganda Week; (3) Inspect and advise institutions, schools, entertainment venues, and others; (4) Advise general households and shops to implement hygiene regulations; (5) Carry out anti-epidemic, fly and mosquito extermination campaigns; (6) Promote labor service, implement cleaning and sweeping; (7) Promote drinking tap water, requesting the tap water management office to reduce water prices and installation fees; (8) Ban violations of hygiene regulations; (9) Issue hygiene manuals to guide citizens; (10) Organize hygiene exhibitions.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the national Summer Hygiene Movement launched by the Association last year was planned in considerable detail, and its implementation was quite diligent. Although the positive and beneficial effects are difficult to estimate, it seems that it has had a considerable effect on the negative side. The reduction of diseases nationwide last summer is one proof of this. We should continue our efforts in the future.</p>
<p>(3) The Autumn Thrift Movement, with the spirit of simplicity, thrift, speed, and certainty, vigorously promotes thrift in order to enrich human, financial, and material resources, and to enable the people to enjoy their work, thereby contributing to national economic construction. As the Thrift Movement was also one of the work outlines of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee General Association last year, this Association consulted with the Committee to jointly work together. On August 1st, a joint office was established, and this Association drafted the "Implementation Measures for the Thrift Movement." After the office held a meeting to review and approve the measures, they were announced to the branches of the National Economic Construction Committee, as well as the New Life Movement Promotion Associations in various provinces, cities, railways, and overseas Chinese communities, with a deadline of September 21st for compliance and implementation, and periodic inspections were conducted.</p>
<p>The scope of work for the Thrift Movement is divided into the following four categories:</p>
<p>A. Time-Saving Movement, with three items: (1) Promote early rising and early sleeping; (2) Strictly adhere to working and meeting times; discourage gambling-like entertainment.</p>
<p>B. Thrifty Spending Movement, with four items: (1) Expenses should be frugal; (2) Gifts and rewards should not be extravagant; (3) Banquets should be simple; (4) Promote savings and insurance.</p>
<p>C. Love-of-Things Movement, with three items: (1) Promote domestic goods; (2) Cherish public property; (3) Utilize waste materials.</p>
<p>D. Enjoy-Your-Work Movement, with four items: (1) Increase people's interest in their occupation; enabling those with jobs to enjoy their work, and enabling the unemployed to start businesses. (2) Join labor service groups during leisure time to engage in road construction, afforestation, dike repair, and other public works. (3) Promote rural side businesses to benefit farmers. Increase wealth. (4) Use saved money, alone or in conjunction with relatives and friends, to engage in productive businesses.</p>
<p>As a result of last year's Thrift Movement, the extravagant and decadent social atmosphere has been reversed to a considerable extent. However, to achieve significant results, New Life Movement colleagues, civil servants, and leaders from all walks of life throughout the country must earnestly promote it in the future.</p>
<p>(4) The Winter Relief Movement started with investigations because the existing relief organizations or groups in various regions were not fully understood. In addition to preparing and issuing survey forms to New Life Movement Associations in various regions with a deadline for completion, the Association also dispatched personnel to conduct investigations at various relief societies in the capital, in order to understand the organization, work, funding, fundraising, and relief methods of these societies, as a reference for formulating a relief movement plan.</p>
<p>3. Other Important Work</p>
<p>Other important work can be roughly divided into the following eleven types: (1) Dispatch inspection teams; (2) Promote the New Life Movement on ships; (3) Pilot summer rural service for university students; (4) Guide national jamborees and reviews of Girl Scouts to perform rural service; (5) Ban extra gratuity movement; (6) Rectify the New Life Movement in Shanghai; (7) Organize the New Life Movement in Guangdong; (8) Promote the National Women's New Life Movement; (9) Organize the Sunset Society; (10) Implement New Life Movement training for workers in various industries nationwide; (11) Organize battlefield service corps.</p>
<p>(1) Dispatch of Inspection Teams. In order to promote the New Life Movement in various regions and intensify work, the Association, following the instructions of the president, trained the fourth class of students in the Political Training Class of the Military Affairs Commission. After graduation, a draft inspection plan was prepared and submitted to the president for approval. One hundred and twenty-eight students were transferred to form the New Life Movement Inspection Team, which was formally established on March 1st. Its tasks were defined as: (1) To examine and assist the general New Life Movement work in various provinces and cities, paying particular attention to the promotion of the Cleanliness and Orderliness Movements; (2) To examine the performance of civil servants and New Life Movement promotion cadres in promoting the New Life Movement, paying particular attention to military police; (3) To guide and inspect the organization and work of New Life Movement Associations and labor service groups in various regions; (4) To investigate the organization and training of the masses in various regions; (5) To investigate the state of social education in various regions, and actively provide guidance and promotion. In addition to the above items, when necessary, actively participate in the work with various party, government, and military organs. The inspection route. From the capital and along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, to Shanghai. Along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, to Hangzhou. Via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and coastal counties, to southern and northern Anhui, into Henan, along the Pinghan and Longhai Railways, and then back to Beijing. The journey lasted six months. After the inspection of each location was completed, a report was prepared and sent to the Association for verification.</p>
<p>(2) Promotion of the New Life Movement on Ships. This can be explained in two points: (1) Assist the Ministry of Communications in implementing the ship management measures. Since April 1st of last year, the following items have been implemented: A. Abolish the compradore system and replace it with an administrative director. B. Sell berths separately from ship tickets. C. Pay stewards a monthly salary, starting from 16 yuan minimum. D. Stipulate that gratuities are one-tenth of the ticket price and cannot be demanded additionally. E. Formulate measures to ban fare evasion on ships. F. Formulate measures for rewarding and punishing China Merchants Bureau workers. (2) Organize New Life Movement training classes for stewards from the China Merchants Bureau and other private shipping companies. Stewards from various ships are rotated for training, with each class lasting two months, teaching New Life Movement essentials, service knowledge, military training, party principles, and hygiene.</p>
<p>Since the promotion of the New Life Movement on ships, the bad habits and malpractices in the management and personnel aspects of Chinese ships have been largely eliminated, making it convenient for merchants and travelers.</p>
<p>(3) Piloting Summer Rural Service for University Students. In order to enable university students to use their summer vacation opportunities to serve rural areas, improve the lives of farmers, and awaken farmers' awareness of the country, a pilot New Life Movement Summer Rural Service Corps was organized. The schools and work areas were limited to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The Association formulated a simple charter and compiled a summer rural service manual, which was distributed to all members to provide a basis for service. Certificates were also issued to each member for identification. At the same time, the Association notified local governments and New Life Movement Associations to provide assistance to facilitate the process. A total of more than 300 students from one school, the Central Political School, joined the work of this group; individuals who voluntarily joined included 66 students from thirteen schools, including Nanjing Central University, Ginling College, Soochow University, Hangzhou Zhejiang University, Shanghai University, and Jinan University. According to the work reports of the members, the work encountered various difficulties and obstacles, but due to the sincere service of the members, the farmers who had received guidance all had a good impression and critique of the group. In the future, based on last year's experience, efforts will be made to promote summer rural service nationwide.</p>
<p>(4) Guiding National Jamborees and Reviews of Girl Scouts to Perform Rural Service. During the Second National Jamboree and Review of Boy Scouts of China last October, the Boy Scouts Association invited this Association to cooperate in designating rural service for Girl Scouts. It was agreed that the service locations would be nine villages near the mausoleum, and the service items would be to guide the cleanliness and hygiene of farmhouses and rural teahouses, barbershops, restaurants, and other venues. The service time was from 1:00 PM to 9:00 PM on October 8th, and the necessary supplies were prepared in advance. Each village was assigned a squad of Girl Scouts, led by a staff member from the office, and police officers were dispatched by the police department to take care of them at all times. The Association dispatched personnel to provide guidance, supervision, and evaluation. As a result, it was found that Girl Scouts generally lacked experience in social service, and it seems necessary to pay special attention to training in the future.</p>
<p>(5) Ban Extra Gratuity Movement. It has been found that waiters in public places in various regions often solicit extra gratuities from guests. This bad habit can not only foster extravagance but also easily cultivate class consciousness among the people, which is contrary to the tenets of the New Life Movement. In order to implement thrift and enhance the character and self-esteem of waiters, it is necessary to thoroughly reform this. Therefore, in July of last year, the Association formulated measures to ban the extra gratuity movement. In general, in addition to the regular bill plus one, waiters should not solicit extra tips from guests. If waiters solicit tips, guests should refuse. If guests give tips, waiters should refuse. A notice was issued to New Life Movement Associations for thorough implementation. According to reports from various regions, compliance has been effective to a considerable extent. The Association also paid attention to guidance and thorough promotion in the capital.</p>
<p>(6) Rectification of the New Life Movement in Shanghai. Based on the report of the inspection team that the New Life Movement work in Shanghai was not practical and needed rectification, the Association specially formulated "Methods to Improve the Promotion of the New Life Movement in Shanghai." The main contents are divided into: (1) Raising personnel and funds; (2) Promoting from civil servants; (3) Promoting the New Life Movement in schools; (4) Training police to promote the New Life Movement. Personnel were dispatched to discuss and rectify the situation with the Shanghai Association.</p>
<p>(7) Organizing the New Life Movement in Guangdong. During the Two Guangxi Incident last year, Guangdong was the first to resolve it peacefully. When the Association sent personnel to promote the New Life Movement in Guangdong in August, the president was still in Guangdong. The working steps were determined in accordance with the president's instructions: (1) Preparation; (2) Organizing the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal New Life Movement Associations; (3) Training New Life Movement cadres and military police; (4) Promotion, from various institutions and social organizations, public places, from heads of various institutions and general civil servants to the general public. In addition, in order to deepen the meaning of the New Life Movement in the hearts of the people, a New Life Movement Propaganda Week was held from September 10th, using various methods to expand publicity. As for the organization of the Women's Work Committee, the rectification of the city's appearance, the printing of slogans, and other plans, either participating in guidance or being responsible for design, all efforts were made.</p>
<p>(8) Promoting the National Women's New Life Movement. In the past year, women throughout the country have vigorously implemented the New Life Movement under the guidance of the Association's Women's Guidance Department. There are ten places where Women's Work Committees, Women's New Life Movement Associations, or Women's Life Improvement Associations have been established, including the capital, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Qinghai, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Xikou, Zhejiang. There are a total of thirty-nine New Life Movement Labor Service Groups for women that have been established nationwide, with more than six thousand six hundred members, of which schools account for sixteen groups, with more than two thousand one hundred and ninety-seven members. In the future, it is planned to adjust the established women's New Life Movement organizations and engage in organization in places where Women's New Life Movement Work Committees have not been established. Efforts will also be made to increase the number of Women's Labor Service Groups in various regions.</p>
<p>(9) Organizing the Sunset Society. In order to train the public, enhance group entertainment, and improve group life, the Association, after a work meeting resolution, decided that the Colleagues' Extracurricular Life Improvement Association would be responsible for organizing the Sunset Society. The meeting place was on the grass in the northeastern corner of the First Park in Beijing, and the meeting time was set for 7:00 PM every Thursday. From July 16th to September 24th, except for one interruption on July 30th, a total of ten consecutive meetings were held. Each meeting included a New Life Movement lecture and entertainment. Starting from the fifth meeting, teaching items were added, such as singing party songs at the fifth meeting, "Salute when raising and lowering the national flag" at the sixth meeting, "Be polite to others" at the seventh meeting, "How to be polite to women and children" at the eighth meeting, "How to cherish public property and pay attention to public morals" at the ninth meeting, etc., which were particularly meaningful. The number of people attending increased from more than a thousand at the first meeting to about six thousand at the last meeting.</p>
<p>(10) Implementing New Life Movement Training for Workers in Various Industries Nationwide. The workers in various industries referred to here are temporarily limited to those serving in (1) restaurants, (2) teahouses, (3) hotels, (4) bathhouses, (5) barbershops, (6) entertainment venues, and other places. In order to awaken their national consciousness, encourage them to practice the New Life Movement, cultivate their service spirit, and improve their business skills, the Association formulated a general outline of the New Life Movement training plan for various types of workers, and in August of last year, notified New Life Movement Associations in various regions to implement it. The content of the outline is divided into: A. Principles, B. Scope, C. Materials, D. Methods and Steps, E. Time, F. Funding, etc. The Association also dispatched personnel to inspect and guide the training of workers in various industries in the capital.</p>
<p>(11) Organizing Battlefield Service Corps. The bandit invasion of Suiyuan aroused national indignation. The government was determined to suppress the bandits, and the soldiers at the front were also able to bravely sacrifice themselves for the country. In order to promote the spirit of serving the country, encourage the people's patriotism, and express assistance and encouragement to the soldiers at the front, the Association specially organized a battlefield service corps to go to the Suiyuan area to serve the soldiers and civilians on the battlefield. Recruitment of members began on December 7th of last year, and by the 10th, more than 120 young people from all walks of life had signed up. After the examination, twenty people were selected and formally organized. Training was implemented from the 15th, including military training, spiritual lectures, New Life Movement essentials, and first aid, and lectures by famous people were held. The planned work after departure was divided into three major categories: (1) Relief, (2) Comfort, (3) Communication. The original plan was to depart around the 20th, but due to the president's misfortune in Xi'an, the plan was temporarily changed. It was decided to first go to Shaanxi to deal with the crisis, and then go to Suiyuan. Many staff members of the Association also signed up to participate. Subsequently, as the president escaped danger and returned to Beijing, the corps changed its plan again and decided to depart for Suiyuan for service in January of this year.</p>
<p>The Association's work over the past year is roughly as described above. Some tasks need to be continued in the future, such as the Cleanliness Movement, Orderliness Movement, Planting Movement, Hygiene Movement, Thrift Movement, Relief Movement, and promoting the National Women's New Life Movement. Some tasks need to be continued in the future, such as dispatching inspection teams and organizing the Sunset Society. Some tasks need to be actively promoted in the future, such as promoting the New Life Movement on ships, student summer rural service, and implementing New Life Movement training for workers. Upon careful review, each task has its own considerable significance and value. However, the New Life Movement is a movement for the national life revolution and a movement for the revitalization of the nation. This movement cannot be completed in a short period of time, nor can it be accomplished by a small number of people. In the future, the colleagues of this Association must continue to test and create in the spirit of experimentation and creation, focusing on the big picture and starting with the small details, so that the work of the New Life Movement can have continuous progress. At the same time, we hope that comrades and leaders from all walks of life throughout the country will continue to work hard and actively carry out the work. In particular, we hope that compatriots across the country will be aware that the past way of life is not in line with the times and the environment, which is enough to cause internal troubles and attract external insults, and that it is necessary to carry out a life revolution and practice it personally. As we celebrate the third anniversary of the New Life Movement and begin the fourth year of work, the colleagues of this Association are willing to work together with comrades from all walks of life and compatriots across the country to plan and work together!</p>

<h3>The Beauty of the Rough</h3>
<p>— Quan Lin</p>
<p>The beauty of the rough, such a term, may cause your misunderstanding, thinking that we are here to promote a dirty, untidy, chaotic life—which is obviously "uncivilized." Here we need to explain that this is not our ultimate goal; what we ultimately seek is the equal beauty of the human spirit and matter, the true beauty of mankind. When such an era arrives, we will see such a beautiful life: humans are free and lively, strong and prosperous, orderly and disciplined, working together for the benefit of the masses, as cheerful and passionate as the sun. But such an era is still very far away—although we can be sure that it will come. At present, in order to strive to pursue such a goal, we must first strip away the false, morbid, and beauty-decorated-by-others'-blood-and-sweat concepts of the old era. When you do this, you will see the resistant faces of the laborers under modern social life, their physical tension, and from the filth, roughness, impoliteness, and intense life, you will see the true soul of humanity, and the truly lovable places of humanity—composed of all these elements, that is the entirety of the beauty of the rough.</p>
<p>In other words, would you (assuming you are also one of the masses) not find the loud, tragic labor chorus emanating from the throats of a group of sweaty, muscle-bulging boatmen, or the pure, unchallengeable grimace floating on a dirty, sun-scorched face, more charming and lovable than the elegant demeanor of gentlemen with powdered faces, or the sweet smiles of ladies nourished by rouge and perfume?</p>
<p>To cite such an example from literature, it is best to contrast the characters of Charles Dickens with the characters of Maxim Gorky. Dickens is undoubtedly one of the most successful people in describing characters in the seventeenth century, and his skills are worth learning. But the characters in each of his novels almost have a certain format, that is, all the characters that the author considers to be good are gentle, kind, dignified, and docile like pigeons, while those recognized by the author as villains are mostly ugly, dirty, rude, cursing all day long, and not believing in God. He wrote this ugliness and beauty to a very extreme degree, even good people in difficult circumstances do not lose their pigeon-like docility, while villains in superior environments reveal their rough weaknesses everywhere. When you read such works, you will deeply imprint the author's concept of beauty, and unintentionally divide humans into a graceful, civilized part—God's chosen people, and an ugly, vulgar, ordinary part, and objectively foster the consciousness that the top-hat class should rule the majority of the people. But when you read Gorky's novels, you will instead be surprised by the protagonists in his books, almost all of whom are a ragged, rough group—smugglers, fugitives, boatmen, hungry farmers, thieves, and traitors to God. Gorky added everything that Dickens used to describe the villains in his books to his protagonists, such as straw-like messy hair, brown short and stiff mustaches, red and festering eyes, and wrinkled skin, which can be seen almost everywhere. When you first come into contact with these masters, you may feel disgusting and ridiculous, but as you gradually become familiar with them, you will suddenly feel that they are cute, and when you finish reading them, you will feel that your soul has merged with these rough people, and even their every frown and smile is charming and beautiful to you at this time; and this kind of beauty cannot be obtained from gentlemen. Indeed, Gorky used his great pen to show us the beauty in the human soul, and to make us see the lovable places of humanity from the rough.</p>
<p>This concept of beauty had already germinated when naturalism began. When Milan rejected the government's request to paint "Hagar and Ishmael in the Desert" and ran back to the village of Barbizon, he openly made a fierce protest against the old concept of beauty. Although he was scolded as a "painter of ugliness" at that time, we can also find this kind of example in our Chinese old novels, such as Water Margin, in which the author wrote Li Kui and Lu Zhishen as the most outstanding characters, and their characteristics lie in their possession of this rough beauty, so that the 17th century Chinese critic Jin Shengtan could not help but call these two rough characters charming and lovable.</p>
<p>Originally, there is no absolute beauty in the world (the so-called pure beauty), because art is a kind of social ideology. But artists should be aware of the tasks of their own historical era, and observe social life from a correct position, and show the beauty of the era from there.</p>
<h3>Mountain Country Love Sketches</h3>
<p>— Han Gu</p>
<p>—Special Feature on Border Customs—</p>
<p>Yulong is a remote and isolated small county in the southwestern border province.</p>
<p>The Jinsha River ripples with graceful waves, flowing down from the upper reaches. On both sides of the river are steep and rugged mountains, with scattered homes distributed on the mountainsides.</p>
<p>The seasons in the mountain country possess a wild quality. Lush forests form a row of jade screens, and wildflowers, like playful children, laugh and dance. Green moss covers the entire mountain, as if inlaid with emeralds. Flocks of sheep wander on the slopes. The sunlight gradually disappears on the shepherd's whip, signaling the approach of dusk. The mountain forests are dyed crimson, and golden waves ripple on the Jinsha River. A few white clouds in the sky resemble piles of tattered old carpets. The sun passes over the earthen walls of the mountain village, and the horizon is a fiery red. The sun is like a lead ball dragged out of a furnace, about to roll down. Shepherds shout "Hush! Hush!" driving the sheep down the mountain. Cowherds! "Wu-qu, wu-qu!" Lead the cattle down the slope. Passersby yell "A-hu-hu-wei-xing-de!—de!" to urge on their horses. The carters shout "Di-li! Purple mule!" and throw a stone at the mule's hindquarters.</p>
<p>The girls of Yulong, treading on the setting sun, cut grass on the mountainside, wearing blue cloth clothes, draped with sheepskins, and tied with aprons. The aprons are folded in half and tucked at the waist, trailing braids, or with braids wrapped around their heads. Some wear white mourning headbands, others wear hats with large red tassels, and all are barefoot.</p>
<p>The men wear head coverings, white undershirts, and woven woolen vests over the undershirts. Their wide-legged trousers are rolled up, and some wear hemp sandals, others wear thread sandals, with a red tassel on the sandal tops. They lead a horse, or walk empty-handed, towards the mountainside. When they see a girl, if she is someone they admire (because they see each other often), they stretch their voices and sing:</p>
<p>"I say, little sister! Your brother wants to be your brother and sister, don't joke around, I'm telling you, it's a pity we're familiar with each other but not well acquainted."</p>
<p>Hearing this, the girl straightens up, looks at the other party, and if she is unwilling, she continues singing:</p>
<p>"I say, you also have brothers and sisters at home, don't joke around, I'm telling you, why bother looking for someone else outside?"</p>
<p>Hearing this, the man gets angry and continues singing:</p>
<p>"I say, little sister! It's strange to see a crooked tree, don't joke around, I'm telling you, I'd chop down two trees more beautiful than you!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, the girl also gets angry and continues singing:</p>
<p>"I say, it's hard to find a straight tree in the mountains, don't joke around, I'm telling you, no one in the world lives to be a hundred years old."</p>
<p>Hearing this, the man refuses to give up and starts cursing:</p>
<p>"I say, a duck is not the companion of a goose, don't joke around, I'm telling you, little sister, how can you match your brother's heart?"</p>
<p>Hearing this, the girl also refuses to give up and continues singing:</p>
<p>"I say, a small rooster is just learning to crow, don't joke around, I'm telling you, a sow climbs over the wall and puts out the fire."</p>
<p>Hearing this, the man curses even more harshly!</p>
<p>"......"</p>
<p>Hearing this, the woman also refuses to give up, and sometimes the two sides will end up fighting.</p>
<p>After the girl hears the man's first song, if she is willing, she will reply in a delicate and gentle tone:</p>
<p>"I say, everyone under the heavens is brothers and sisters, don't joke around, I'm telling you, I'm not afraid of being familiar by face, not well acquainted."</p>
<p>Hearing this, the man feels indescribably happy and relaxed, and continues singing:</p>
<p>"I say, little sister! Bees travel far to gather nectar, don't joke around, I'm telling you, don't look at the feet, look at the journey."</p>
<p>Hearing this, the girl continues singing:</p>
<p>"I say, the dove pecks at the feet, don't joke around, I'm telling you, step by step, come closer."</p>
<p>So the two people sing and walk together. The two sit on the mountainside, admiring the sunset glow in the sky, watching the birds covered in pale red gauze flying in the sky. The mountain sends the sounds of the yellow chestnuts, mixed with the sound of the Jinsha River, flowing eastward. The willows on the shore sway in the evening breeze, casting their shadows in the water, like cradles swinging. The two sit together, facing the booklet, humming mountain songs, until dusk, when the cold wind fades the setting sun. The brilliant sunset glow disappears on the distant river, the distant mountains gradually darken and become hazy, the river surface is covered with a thin mist, and the trees on the mountain sway with a black, shiny light in the blurry twilight. The two agree on the next appointment, and then reluctantly part.</p>
<h3>Romantic Talk (Woodcut)</h3>
<p>— M. Pikov</p>
<h3>Before the Tomb</h3>
<p>— Long Gonggong</p>
<p>Like a small hill, a pile of purposes about to wither, red flowers placed before me. I calmly breathe in the fragrance of the earth, carrying traces of all unforgettable memories. Afterwards, I lay down beside it, closed my eyes, and the sun gradually moved away from my eyelids.</p>
<p>I purely and silently sleep in the darkness. No wind, no flowers, no myself.</p>
<p>The huge sound from the heart of the earth roared. Underground springs flowed below, like millions of madmen rushing towards a small spark. I accepted the sensation and sang a silent song of rest. In my heart, I sang each simple phrase, "May you—rest—in peace—" repeatedly, endlessly, slowly, heavily, never able to finish.</p>
<p>"Rest—in—the earth..."</p>
<p>My lips were stiff, and tears were like a pair of iron tongs, coldly clamping my temples and aching back of my head. I was not singing, but each phrase in the song was lifting its heel and stomping heavily on my heart.</p>
<p>"Hey, get up, what are you doing here!"</p>
<p>The sweeper (the one who asked me for the snowball flowers when I walked in, saying he would use a tin can to display them for me, but I refused) came again and woke me up. He kicked my head and pressed down on my outstretched arm a few times. He placed two buckets of clean water that he had fetched from the distant water pipe by the side of the road.</p>
<p>When I used my palm to scoop some water from his bucket to sprinkle on the iris flowers, he disagreed and said, "It's useless, water—how can it work? The sun will soften them as soon as it shines and the wind blows."</p>
<p>But I was determined to dig a deep hole in front of the grave to plant my flowers in it. I dug with my fingers, dry branches, and tiles. The soil was wet and firm, making it difficult to dig a cylindrical shape, enough to plant my flowers securely in the hole.</p>
<p>"You can't dig a hole here!" The sweeper interfered again.</p>
<p>"Why can't I? Isn't the ground for planting flowers?"</p>
<p>"I won't allow it!" This time he spat out his words severely.</p>
<p>"I insist on digging!"</p>
<p>Having no other choice, he picked up his water buckets and walked away. I heard him say this ridiculous lie while humming:</p>
<p>"Dig, if you dig a hole in the ground—it will rain, and water will leak into the grave... I'm doing it for the best!"</p>
<p>With no one and no birds around, I offered one last solemn salute to that great existence—the eternal existence.</p>
<h3>Old Duan</h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>He looks very young, only about seventeen or eighteen years old, but we got to know each other very well. I still liked to add the character "old" to his surname, as the people of Xining generally did, and call him Old Duan. He cooked and managed the warehouse for others, but when he was free to go out, he liked to wear a full Western suit, or just a white shirt, paired with Western trousers and leather shoes. The first time we met, I couldn't guess what he did at all. I just shook his hand and felt that his palm was very rough, especially between his thumb and middle finger, there were thick calluses. Before I met some sailor friends, (sailors really like to wear Western suits) I was very surprised to see a worker who liked to dress so nicely, and I was also slightly dissatisfied. This wasn't to say that he didn't fit the part and shouldn't wear it, but I thought, why learn these unnecessary luxuries? When he said one day that he had read my articles in the newspaper, and took out a dog-eared book from his arms, pointing with his clumsy fingers, asking me to explain some new terms to him, I completely tore down this veil of dissatisfaction. This is what happens when people have an inner connection, and if they understand each other better, they will naturally forget about appearances.</p>
<p>He had never formally studied. At first, he wanted to recognize a few characters. He lived with a typesetter who was a fellow villager, and saw that people of the same age as him were able to read books and newspapers, and talk about many things that he didn't understand to the adults. Afterwards, he had an even stronger desire to study after meeting a young man who was stranded in Yangon and unable to develop, and only taught in a private school. Due to this person's daily guidance, his childish mind also warmed up to the hope for the future of mankind. Previously, in the kitchen, he had been confused and mixed with oil smoke and coal ash, wasting the best time of his life. He didn't care, but now, he took out the book from his arms while the rice pot wasn't cooking, quietly squatted by the stove and read. Whenever he had free time, he would try to meet young friends with promise, wanting to learn something worthwhile from others. According to him, saving up his wages to make Western suits started at this time.</p>
<p>His boss, a gloomy middle-aged businessman, specialized in wholesale "Chinese bellflower" business. —Regarding "Chinese bellflower", I still don't know whether it's a Chinese name or a Burmese transliteration. I only know that this raw material, when made, is the red sealing wax we use on envelopes and parcel bags. —Since hiring Old Duan, he has saved another labor expense, because in addition to asking him to cook, he also had him manage the "Chinese bellflower" in the usually locked warehouse, and supervise the Indian workers who carried it. For Old Duan, this was not very difficult, because he had followed horse drivers and noodle shop masters since he was a child, and had experienced a lot of training and hardship. Moreover, he was extremely quick, and as long as the warehouse was locked, he could take the time to do things under his own name—read books, find friends. The boss was initially unhappy that he often went out, but because Old Duan had learned to be quick-witted while working as a waiter in a noodle shop, he told the boss directly that he only sold his strength and did not sell his body, that he had done everything well and had never slacked off in a single job. Why was he not allowed to go out? If he was prevented without reason, he would rather quit. The boss blushed, scratched his head, and casually said a few evasive words that would not compromise his status, and afterwards, he turned a blind eye and let him be free.</p>
<p>His boss was also very dissatisfied with him wearing Western suits, but he was not willing to say it directly. Once, the Indian Gandhi came to Yangon to promote the non-violent resistance movement. The boss went to see it and came back, bringing good intentions, and said to Old Duan: "Look at Gandhi, who is famous all over the world, he is still naked, only wearing a piece of cloth! Everyone on the street respects him when they see him? I believe that it's not important to be particular, about leather shoes and Western suits." Old Duan told me that he knew that the boss's words did not contain bad intentions, but because he saw that annoying teaching expression, he retorted to him, "Big shots are great" even if they don't wear a thread and their balls are showing, someone will still hold them! How can we compare to those people? We people wear Western suits, and we still get stepped on. One time, he came looking very distressed. He said: "Recently, after eating dinner, the boss straightens his clothes and goes out. The boss's wife hurriedly asked me to follow him closely and see where the boss went. As a result, the boss went to a Japanese prostitute. I think, honestly, if I tell the truth, the two of them will make a big fuss and beat each other bloody, and besides, a guy like the boss will play with one woman after another, how will he change for the better just because you have an argument out of nowhere? It's like a cat that eats fish, how can we get rid of the fishy smell? If I were to come back and tell her everything, it wouldn't do anyone any good. As for myself, I might even break my rice bowl, because if the boss becomes angry, wouldn't he blame me? I had to lie, so that everyone can be clean. At the same time, I didn't want the boss's wife to blame me for not being diligent, so I told the boss everything about the boss's wife asking me to be a detective, because the boss's words when he came back didn't match what I made up at all, and that woman's mouth wouldn't curse you until you were bleeding? You tell me, did I do the right thing? ... Sigh, no matter how you say it, I always feel like I've done something wrong, and I'm always sad, you don't even know, every time she asks me to tail the boss, she gives me money."</p>
<p>Later, he finally quit his job. It wasn't that the boss didn't want him, but that he needed more time to settle down for himself. He found a coffee shop opened by an acquaintance from Fujian. He made coffee with him, sweating, and learned charcoal portraiture from him. He wanted to learn to draw portraits so that he could freely direct himself and not be occupied by others. The above is what I knew when I was in Yangon. After returning to China, he also corresponded with me a few times. Although there were many typos, the meaning and emotions were expressed clearly. The year before last, Ah Guang, a Cantonese typesetter (I plan to talk about this person in another article), edited the Coconut Breeze Weekly on the Yangon Daily News. He even used the pen name Meng Xing (meaning awakened from a dream), and wrote several short sketches. The real life of a worker's original color, mixed with the folk songs and dialects of Shidian, Yunnan, made me feel interested and surprised. Last year, I received a letter from Ah Huang, saying that he had returned to his hometown and opened a photography studio with a monk friend in the Bai area of Yunnan, and he was actually working as a photographer. Then, he said that for some reason, the chieftain had sealed his business. Where is he now? This young friend who keeps struggling. I hope that when I hear from him again, it will still be a series of surprises!</p>
<h3>Solo</h3>
<p>— Qin Zihao</p>
<p>Few audience members</p>
<p>But the curtain rises</p>
<p>A girl stands on the stage</p>
<p>Small like a pigeon</p>
<p>The audience's eagle eyes shoot at her heart</p>
<p>Because she has the expression of an actor</p>
<p>She is singing a rhapsody</p>
<p>But why is the accompanying music so sad</p>
<p>The singing is not harmonious</p>
<p>The accompanying music is too suffocating</p>
<p>She tries her best to express her tenderness in her movements</p>
<p>Those ladies cast envious eyes at her</p>
<p>The audience seems to be falling asleep</p>
<p>Her song is over</p>
<p>But there is not a single cheer from the audience</p>
<p>Not even applause</p>
<p>Too sweet songs have too bitter tears</p>
<p>Her youth has reached the moment of burning</p>
<p>Life has turned her passion into cold ashes</p>
<p>In the cold ashes are her countless hot tears</p>
<h3>Exodus</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>On a rainy night, the seasonal winter wind blew in through the window cracks, and the curtains moved.</p>
<p>Guarding that dim lamp, taking advantage of this rare day of rest, I thought, it should be time for a wanderer to write a letter home. I picked up my pen, what should I write? The most important thing, of course, is the state of life, but, how should I start writing about an ordinary encounter? Hesitating, annoyed, I thought I'd better give up this attempt at reporting!</p>
<p>Just as I was pondering, a very light step opened the door. A gray cotton robe was soaked in the rain, and rainwater dripped from his hair, covering his entire face. A few stiff whiskers added to his older years, and his eyes were so panicked and melancholy! This friend, whom I hadn't seen in more than a year, had become so decadent. Really, if it weren't for the familiar facial contours that gave me an unmistakable sign, I could simply have other illusions.</p>
<p>He sat down, the lamplight shone on him, and teardrops fell to the ground, as if with endless grievances.</p>
<p>He was silent, and didn't speak for a long time, allowing the air disturbed by the ticking of the clock to maintain a moment's distance between us.</p>
<p>"This will become an eternal and indelible case!" he said, indignantly, "A weak villager, standing in front of a powerful local gentry, for the sake of—ah, what can I say?"...</p>
<p>The village, needless to say, is naturally not as good as before. Natural disasters, plus banditry, plus usurious loans, and piecemeal extortion, these give the villagers not "prosperity", but go in the opposite direction towards the road of "decline", and thus, cause the local gentry a fatal blow. Extortion is, in fact, impossible, and even the interest on usurious loans cannot be obtained. In those people's eyes, there is only "coercion"! He casually sipped a mouthful of hot tea, and the events passed through his head like a horse running by, and he laughed coldly.</p>
<p>You probably still remember Wang Wu from West Street, right? That sturdy young man, who was not afraid of the sun or the wind, worked for this family all year round and did some odd jobs. He was honest enough, and you rarely saw him get angry. Who knew that the root of the disaster was planted on the head of his wife who hadn't consummated the marriage?</p>
<p>That young wife had some beauty, the so-called beauty was not the kind of妖 in the city, but a natural kind of simple beauty, which aroused Binggen's covetousness. You may not have forgotten, right?—Binggen, is the son of the big landlord whom Wang Wu is employed by. That guy once fought with me twice, and as a result, he was easily given some lessons. "Losing out", he considered to be the supreme insult. Several times, he also instructed the servants to repay past hatred, but, after all, it was he who suffered the pain, unless he didn't come out. Hatred was planted very deeply among us.</p>
<p>For the sake of oppression, for the sake of intimidation, how could a weak underage woman resist this violent giving? Finally, one autumn night, the dense bushes reflected and covered, becoming an excellent screen. Autumn insects shook the entire earth, and moonlight smeared a corner of the treetops. In the quiet and solemn night, who knew that behind the bushes, there was an uneasy atmosphere!</p>
<p>After death, this matter was quickly discovered, and needless to say, in addition to the corporal punishment of the young wife, the eyes, all the resentment, was focused on the initiator.</p>
<p>His face sank, making the air in the small building even more serious.</p>
<p>The days were fast, and half a month passed in a calm storm. Speaking of which, autumn brings people the boredom of loneliness. On the back mountain where I lived, it seemed even more terrifyingly lonely at night. The back mountain was indeed scary. During the day, other than a few wild children picking up the wild grass and dry branches that no one cared for, this place was cut off from human traces as soon as it turned to dusk. The people who liked to gossip said that they had seen the appearance of ghost fire. On one stormy night, I heard a groaning cry. Braving the wind and rain, I took a storm lantern and rushed out. Unexpectedly, I never thought that the one lying on the ground was actually Binggen! Rolling around, not looking like himself, finally, his mouth opened a few times, as if with infinite remorse. It was over, the groaning lowered, and could not be heard.</p>
<p>The next day, rumors spread that because of something something in the past, "suspicion" will also be implicated!</p>
<p>His face was terrifyingly green, and I simply didn't dare to look directly at him. Finally, he swallowed the only remaining bit of hot tea, hurriedly left his seat, and shook my hand. How cold his palm was! —The cold and unfamiliar land will be the object of my drifting from now on. He said, walked down the stairs, and the alley walls swallowed his figure. A drizzle shot over, perhaps symbolizing his destiny!</p>
<h3>Fragments of Private Life</h3>

<p>A cigarette, a chalk,</p>

<p>But cannot shed the blood of the soul;</p>
<p>Chalk white as snow,</p>
<p>Muscles stick to the blackboard,</p>
<p>Saliva dyes the brown and green hair white;</p>
<p>Faces of young people line up in front of me</p>
<p>Such bloody smiles,</p>
<p>I suspect I'm a clown;</p>
<p>But their pupils are so bright,</p>
<p>Clearly excavating the vague truths from me,</p>
<p>But they will also cry passionately,</p>
<p>I hate that I haven't shed tears first.</p>
<p>The clock strikes mechanically and monotonously,</p>
<p>It really shatters my lead heart!</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>“China Rises Like the Sun in the East”</h3>
<p>— Ying Chun</p>
<p>According to a report on the 15th: "Former Consul-General to Nanjing, Mr. Suma, has given numerous lectures on Sino-Japanese issues at the invitation of various organizations and groups since returning to Tokyo. Local circles believe that Mr. Suma, having been stationed in China for eleven years and having participated in various important negotiations, his observations are of great importance. Mr. Suma, in his lecture 'The Current Situation of the Nanjing Government and the Future of Sino-Japanese Relations' at the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun's East Asia Research, praised the increasing consolidation of China's unification and the improvement of discipline in the Chinese army. He also stated that China's unification is due to the 'Guangdong Spirit,' a novel term. In conclusion, Mr. Suma cited a foreign person's saying: 'Japan is like the setting sun, China is like the rising sun,' warning the audience to pay serious attention to Sino-Japanese relations in the future."</p>
<p>Mr. Suma's position among Japanese diplomats in China seems to be quite high, and the cases he has handled seem to be numerous. Therefore, his careful speech—some discretion is expected—is naturally what we anticipate. This time, in Tokyo, he actually spoke some good words about China, which is not surprising. Those skilled in rhetoric are often always smiling, especially since he is a diplomat. However, there is a common Chinese saying: "A dagger hidden in a smile," meaning that a smiling face does not necessarily harbor good intentions. We certainly cannot say that Mr. Suma is one of these people, because we are afraid of unintentionally slighting the envoy of our "friendly nation."</p>
<p>However, in recent years, we have lost vast territories, and those who "negotiate" between coercion and inducement are often these envoys. We sincerely wish to be "friendly with our friendly nations," but how can we be "friendly"! The death of one Japanese resident immediately leads to the Beihai Incident, the Chengdu Incident, and the Hankou Incident, which not only makes the local people uneasy but also puts the Chinese government in a difficult diplomatic position. Major upheavals are constant. —Naturally, this is because they know our weaknesses, so they take great advantage. As the military strategists say: "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." They can be said to be deeply aware of our internal affairs. The deployment of spies throughout our interior is chilling to think about.</p>
<p>Mr. Suma's lecture this time cannot be said to be a reflection of a deep understanding of China's situation. Our unification is naturally disadvantageous to them. The saying "Japan is like the setting sun, China is like the rising sun" is not actually "good words," but he used it to "warn" the Japanese audience to "pay serious attention to Sino-Japanese relations." I remember not long ago, Major General Matsumuro, who replaced Doihara as head of the special services agency, also spoke eloquently about China's political situation in an intelligence report. Mr. Suma and Mr. Matsumuro do not seem to be very different. They say China is unified. This unification is facilitated by the "Guangdong Spirit." What is the "Guangdong Spirit"? We do not need to delve into it, but there is no doubt that they hope this "spirit" will not last. The Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang is a sign of China's unification and revitalization. We hope that in this plenary session, we will concretely decide on our strategies and future for national salvation. Then, we will truly "rise like the sun in the east" and embark on a broad path of diligent governance.</p>
<h3>Congratulations and Get Rich</h3>
<p>— Ruyi</p>
<p>During the New Year, when relatives and friends meet, they almost always say "Congratulations and get rich."</p>
<p>Getting rich is a happy thing, but it is definitely not possible to get rich just by saying "Get rich." As the saying goes: "A healthy body leads to wealth." It can be seen that good health is a prerequisite for getting rich.</p>
<p>To be healthy, you also need to take tonic and nourishing medicines. For example, those with high blood pressure should take blood-enriching medicines, and those with weak lungs should take cod liver oil. Among blood-enriching medicines, "Zilai Blood" is definitely the most effective. Among cod liver oils, "Five Continents Milky White Cod Liver Oil" and "Globe Brand Malt Cod Liver Oil" are definitely the most nourishing. Taking them in time will definitely make your body strong and your spirit vigorous, creating a golden career.</p>
<h3>On Her Dressing Table</h3>
<p>— Zhong Xiang</p>
<p>There is an exquisite residence on Yuyuan Road. The owner of this residence is a certain lady. Because the owner loves elegance and cleanliness, the house is especially tidy, especially her bedroom, which is decorated in a quiet style. On a dressing table, there are several kinds of cosmetics, and the bottle styles and decorations are very beautiful.</p>
<p>The cosmetics displayed on this dressing table are a bottle of "131 Hair Water," a bottle of "33 Perfume," a bottle of "Yipin Fragrant Snow Cream," and a bottle of "Planet Brand Honey Fragrance." It turns out that these are all products of the Five Continents Pharmacy, and they have three characteristics: good quality, fragrant smell, and cheap price. Such high-quality domestic products are most suitable for display on the dressing table of a noble lady.</p>
<h3>By the Side of Gaisel Lake</h3>
<p>— Zhang Hai</p>
<p>Disturbed all night by the fierce barking of dogs, we, whose bodies were soaked with fatigue, could not sleep peacefully. As soon as it dawned, a strange and noisy sound was seething outside the Mongolian yurt, which made people uncomfortable, especially the hoarse sounds of cattle and the mournful bleating of sheep mixed together, stabbing directly into people's ears. The plain was like a troubled person, unable to calm down at all. Our host, that kind teacher in his forties, was groping in a dark room, the cigarette holder in his mouth flashing a faint red flame. He knelt down before the Buddhist shrine and silently recited prayers. After a while, he blew a horn outside the yurt and drove the herd of livestock to the pasture for grazing.</p>
<p>The hostess squatted by the stove to make a fire. Old horse dung emitted a smelly odor as it burned. She was busy and walked back and forth in the yurt, as if there was something wrong with her brain. She didn't know what food and drink to use to entertain us. My fellow traveler, the Buryat Mongolian Basula, told her in Khalkha that we had brought our own food and could cook it ourselves, so she shouldn't bother. But she refused. She almost got angry. She said, "Do you look down on us? We like guests the most! You have come from afar and rarely come to our place. How can you not eat something from us!" We couldn't refuse to eat her breakfast.</p>
<p>After eating, we wanted to leave. The camel driver had urged us two or three times, saying that if we didn't leave early, we probably wouldn't be able to reach "Banta" tonight, because there were no wells to be found in "Kanlinte," and we had to stay overnight in "Banta." But the hostess didn't want us to leave right away. She wanted to take us to see "Gaisel Lake."</p>
<p>Led by the hostess, the four of us went to a livestock pen to the west, and everyone got a horse to ride. Soon we stepped onto a main road.</p>
<p>"This main road was only built last year. The idea was from the ×× people. The lamas and princes forced us people to build it. To tell you the truth, none of us people often walk on this main road. It's the cars of the ×× people that keep running back and forth on this main road."</p>
<p>Sunshine was scattered across the wilderness, and herds of livestock were squirming on the grassland. The horses joyfully neighed. Ivanovitch, who hadn't opened his mouth from morning until now, hummed the "Volga" folk song as if lost in memories. He reined in his horse on one side, deliberately wanting to distance himself from us a little. This fellow traveler was often like this. He didn't like to walk and stroll with others. In Harbin, friends called him "the lonely black bear."</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"Gaisel Lake" is not as beautiful as "West Lake." In fact, it is a small bay with a few jujube trees on the embankment, and the reeds grow very short. I was disappointed! I can simply say that I was fooled by the hostess! She knew what we meant from the look on our faces. She said intimately:</p>
<p>"The lake really isn't much to see. I didn't want you to come here to see the lake scenery. I want to tell you something."</p>
<p>She led us to the large plain by the lake. There was a square here, built very flat.</p>
<p>"Did you see that! This is a drill ground. The ×× people forced King × to have us build it well. King × then went everywhere to pick young men to be soldiers. Some were willing to go and be soldiers themselves. King × gave each of them a gun and taught them how to fire and how to fight. Every day, morning and evening, there are large teams of people practicing fighting on this field. One day, ten horsemen came from somewhere, passing by here, and were caught by the ×× people! It is said that they were spies sent by the Buryat Republic. Without asking any questions, they tied up the ten people, poured kerosene on their hair, and then lit it. Two soldiers carried one person, and when their hair was burning fiercely, they threw them into the lake with force. In this way, ten people of unknown origin were thrown alive into the lake and drowned! Now all the young men in our "Shalsha" area have been transported away! I heard that they were transported to Suiyuan to fight! Oh! Aren't you also going to Suiyuan? But in "Shalsha," you must not say that you are going to Suiyuan. If the lamas and princes find out, you will lose your lives!"</p>
<p>The four of us fellow travelers dismounted at the same time and bowed deeply to the hostess, expressing our utmost gratitude to her.</p>
<p>It was already close to noon when we left Shalsha. I was wary of the road ahead.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Trip Around the World by Air (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Falconer of the United States, specially translated</p>
<p>I served in the American civil service all my life until 1931, when I finally retired. Since then, I have spent my time traveling. I have traveled around the world four times before, and this year I decided to travel around the world again by air. I live in the state of Texas. My initial plan was to fly from Dallas to Miami, take a Pan American Airlines plane to the capital of Brazil, then take the Graf Zeppelin airship to Germany, and then take an Imperial Airways, French Airlines, or Royal Dutch Airlines plane to the East, and then take a Pan American Airlines Clipper back to the United States.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to buy a ticket, I saw in the newspaper that the new German airship Hindenburg would begin flying across the Atlantic in May, departing from Frankfurt, Germany, and ending in Lakehurst, New Jersey, USA. So I changed my plan and flew from Dallas to Newark, New Jersey, on May 8, a distance of 1,402 miles, taking ten and a half hours.</p>
<p>From May 11 to May 14, I took the Hindenburg from Lakehurst to Frankfurt, a distance of 4,500 miles, taking 49 hours and 3 minutes. The Hindenburg was a very large airship, with 25 rooms, each accommodating two passengers, with two sleeping berths and hot and cold water faucets inside. The ship had a large dining room, writing room, card room, bar, bathroom, and a promenade deck. The chairs and utensils in the ship were all made of aluminum, making them very light. Each side of the ship had long glass windows about three feet high and fifty feet wide, allowing passengers to look down at the land and sea from the windows during flight.</p>
<p>The average altitude of ordinary airplanes is about two miles above the ground, but the Hindenburg airship was only 700 feet above the ground, so when it flew over New York City, we could see the two hands of the street clock clearly from the ship. The main reason it flew so low was that the air at this altitude is denser than the air above, so less oxygen is needed to support the airship in the sky. There were 51 passengers on this flight. The fare from Lakehurst to Frankfurt, including meals and gratuities, was only US$400. Recently, the ship added twelve more rooms, so it can carry a total of 72 passengers. The entire journey from Lakehurst to Frankfurt is 4,500 miles long, with no stops along the way. At the beginning of the journey, it flew over New York City and other places, entered Europe, and flew over Ireland, Scotland, and northern Germany, which was very interesting.</p>
<p>The commander of the flight cabin was Dr. Eckener. I had a conversation with him thanks to his kindness. According to him, he believed that the Zeppelin airship would definitely become a common means of crossing the Atlantic in the future. Germany will soon build three sister ships of the Hindenburg, so there will be a total of four Zeppelin airships flying between Frankfurt and New York. He also said that the large Zeppelin has traveled between Europe and South America more than a hundred times, carrying nearly 30,000 passengers, and no one has lost their life.</p>

<p>or injured, Dr. Kneipps, the mayor of Frankfurt, also took the Hindenburg back and forth this time. After returning to his city, he held a reception at the Gu Shi Town Hall, which lasted from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Many famous citizens of the city also attended this grand event. At the end of the meeting, he gave each guest a badge with a silver silhouette of the Hindenburg printed on a blue background, and a certificate printed on parchment, proving that he was one of the passengers on the first flight of the Hindenburg from Lakehurst to Frankfurt.</p>
<h3>Brightness</h3>
<p>— Li Liwen</p>
<p>The school saved electricity, and I saved money, so I spent a winter vacation in the dark.</p>
<p>Every day, when the sky began to darken, my terror arrived…</p>
<p>My courage was not great in the first place, and my mind was filled with various bizarre and absurd stories of gods and ghosts like every Chinese person. Lying alone in the house in the dark, I couldn't help but shudder in my heart and feel scared… In the darkness, it was originally the world of all kinds of demons and ghosts. The more afraid I was, it was as if something was really crying in the dark, sneering in the dark, and even reaching out a cold hand. A chill ran down my spine, I shrank my head into the quilt, unable to sleep all night, hoping that it would dawn soon, hoping that the first crowing of the rooster would come soon…</p>
<p>From then on, I knew more deeply why light is so lovely?</p>
<p>"Why are they so stupid," I often thought when I was a child. Now I know why those poor moths are willing to die in the fire.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Sweeping Qin"</p>
<p>Don't laugh at his foolish and crazy appearance, the Bodhisattva of Earth Treasure deliberately descends to the mortal world. He borrows a body to sit in meditation at Lingyin Temple, and writes poems on the wall to sweep away Qin. The current prime minister comes to offer incense, holding three sticks of incense in his hand, lowering his head to silently communicate with the gods. He only wishes for favorable weather and a peaceful country, and only seeks a long spring for the couple. He protects Yue Fei and his son, wishing them early transcendence to the immortal realm. Raising his head and suddenly seeing the poem, the treacherous hero trembles in shock. This poem was written with his wife, and when the matter is exposed, he is burned by a raging fire, and immediately angrily asks the mad monk. He doesn't know that he spits out Zen secrets and is full of changes, calling wind and rain, and is all-powerful. He holds a fire tube to communicate with foreign countries, and also takes a palm broom to sweep away treacherous officials. The storm is only caused by monopolizing power, and he dies unjustly at Lengquan Pavilion. Returning home, the couple discuss together, shaving their heads and converting to Buddhism, but they seek fame. They listen to the slander of a long-tongued woman, and suffer all the punishments of Fengdu hell. To this day, their whole bodies are cast in iron at Yue Wang's tomb.</p>

<h3>Aftersound</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications (1300) will specially invite Professor Yin Yiwen of Fudan University to give a lecture on "Unification and National Salvation" from 5:15 PM to 5:45 PM today. All circles are requested to pay attention to listening at that time.</p>
<p>Movies</p>
<h3>About "Song at Midnight"</h3>
<p>"Song at Midnight" is a suspenseful horror masterpiece directed by Ma Xubang. It has taken as long as eight months from production to the present. During the work, Ma Xubang even vomited blood several times, which shows his attention and dedication to this film.</p>
<p>Many people have tried to make horror movies, but in the end they didn't succeed. The unwillingness to make a decision is certainly one of the reasons. In fact, the root cause lies in the limitations of material conditions. Xinhua Company's productions have always been known for their sophistication and perfection. With the full availability of technical conditions, the satisfactory harvest of "Song at Midnight" will surely surprise you.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, "Song at Midnight" is always immersed in an atmosphere of horror, pushing strangeness and absurdity to the extreme, but its story is very realistic and targets this unreasonable society.</p>
<p>The strength of the cast is also worth mentioning. Jinshan's makeup as a hideous monster is not only realistic, but especially the inner performance will surely evoke sympathy. Hu Ping's portrayal of a lady from a noble family, Shi Chao's portrayal of a handsome young man, Zhou Wenzhu's portrayal of a rickety old woman, Gu Menghu's portrayal of a纨绔子弟, Xu Manli's portrayal of a young girl, and Wang Weiyi's portrayal of a strange old man all do their best to reach the realm of perfection.</p>
<h3>Baby Bai Ling's Another Great Work "Rainbow Shadow and Floral Voice" Showing at the Great Shanghai Theater</h3>
<p>Baby Bai Ling, the nine-year-old child prodigy in "Liyuan Thinks of Her Son," will meet the audience again at the Great Shanghai Theater starting today. The film is titled "Rainbow Shadow and Floral Voice." Baby Bai Ling plays a lonely orphan who sells flowers on the street and sings a clear song. Baby Bai Ling's talented singing voice has already given the audience a very deep impression in the film "Liyuan Thinks of Her Son." Superstar Eddie Cantor once hired him to co-broadcast on the radio and called him one of the greatest personalities on the screen and stage. Baby Bai Ling gives full play to his strengths in this film, singing seven or eight times. Among them are old folk songs, solemn sacred songs, and lively black famous songs. The most beautiful is the "Galaxy Rainbow Shadow Song," whose melody is melodious and touches people's hearts. Supporting actors include the old woman star Mei Laura Robson, and the humor master Charles Spalding, etc.</p>
<h3>"Our Children's Theater Society's First Recruitment of Members Continued News"</h3>
<p>"Our Children's Theater Society," located inside the New Central Theater at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road in this city, is China's only permanent children's theater society, and it is a group organized by children themselves. After they performed "Wild Children" last Christmas, they prepared for the first public performance of a one-act children's play "Education of Love." They rehearsed for more than a month, and saved their candy money to raise a sum of money, but because they could not find a theater in the Nanshi Zhabei area, they submitted the script to the concession for review, hoping to perform in a certain large theater. Now, they have begun their first recruitment of members, preparing to expand the organization before the public performance and convene an inaugural meeting, requesting all circles to give them some guidance and some help. Since the news of their recruitment of members was published in various newspapers, many people have written letters to ask for the charter. Several letters were written jointly by children, which shows that the children in this city are very fond of drama. The children's drama movement is worthy of our attention and help. It is said that Mu Xie, the author of "Wild Children," also wrote to them, willing to guide them, which is also something we are happy about. These days, the ticket office of the New Central Theater often has children asking about the society, preparing to participate. But impatient children who run there before 3:00 PM always make a wasted trip and do not see the staff of the society. Because the staff of the society are all studying, or doing apprenticeships, they can only come to the society after 3:00 PM every day, so please don't go too early for those children who have gone or want to go in the future. Finally, I want to tell everyone a good news, the society's recent work is experimenting with "shadow puppets"; and this Sunday afternoon at 3:00, they will hold a tea party, and there will be singing and other entertainment, and they also welcome children who love drama to participate.</p>
<h3>"Serve the Country With Utmost Loyalty" Showing in Paris</h3>
<p>"Serve the Country With Utmost Loyalty" is one of the ten major films of 1936 and is indeed the leader in war films. It inspires patriotic ideas and depicts battlefield life. Judging from the stars of the film, Fredric March, Warner Baxter, and Lionel Barrymore, the joint performance of three giants is even more valuable. Wherever this film goes, it is crowded. Paris is taking advantage of the beginning of this new spring to contribute to a continuous stream of masterpieces after "Ramona" and "The Island of Injustice". The next film to be released in succession has already been scheduled for Eddie Cantor's "Peach and Plum Blossoms Blooming".</p>
<h3>Spring News from Yi Hua</h3>
<p>Yue Feng, the director of "Mysterious Flower," written by Pan Zinong, gathered the male and female leads of the play yesterday, such as Bai Yang, Wang Naidong, Ma Loufen, Jiang Xiu, Guan Hongda, Liang Dusheng, etc., and all the staff in the screenwriting department to discuss the plot. Yue Feng's handling of the entire "Mysterious Flower" will offer a new perspective to the silver screen.</p>
<p>Chen Kengran's "Elastic Daughter" is nine-tenths completed. There are still a few important outdoor scenes that need to be filmed as soon as possible. It is expected that the public release of "Elastic Daughter" will be in the bright spring, meeting with all the ladies of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Xu Suling's "Sea and Sky Lovers" has completed eight-tenths since filming began. There is a scene in the play where a sea liner has an accident and Wang Yin encounters danger, which is planned to be shot on location off the coast of Fuzhou. Xu will lead a large team to film it when the warm spring begins.</p>
<p>"Siamese Lotus" is a masterpiece co-created by the Southern fairy Zi Luolan and the famous young actor Wu Chufan. The plot takes love as the theme, depicting young men and women advocating free union and opposing the old-fashioned marriage with feudal colors, with meticulous depiction. The filming of the play is about to be completed.</p>
<p>Huang Ximo's screenplay "Three Stars Accompanying the Moon" uses a light-hearted style to describe a theme centered on promoting Chinese industrial and commercial undertakings and praising the Principle of People's Livelihood. It is a masterpiece with great realism, and has great song and dance scenes interspersed enthusiastically. The play is directed by Fang Peilin and will be filmed simultaneously with "Mysterious Flower."</p>
<p>Yi Hua Company's new lineup for the first half of the year, in addition to the currently released "Incarnation Girl Sequel" and "Full Garden Spring Scenery," the remaining six blockbusters such as "Elastic Daughter," "Siamese Lotus," "Sea and Sky Lovers," "Mysterious Flower," "Three Stars Accompanying the Moon," and "Female God of Wealth" must be completed in sequence and released successively.</p>
