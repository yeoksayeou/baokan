<p>時評</p>
<h3>國貨聯營前途之屬望</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>經建總會籌備之國貨聯營公司。已於日昨草創成立。官商董監。分別推定。首次常董會議。亦經召開。决定總副經理人選。通過營業辦法大綱。並聞該公司除積極充實已成立之上海廣州等十二處國貨公司外。更擬增設首都及平津漢口等新公司十七家。預計盛猷遠布。碩續宏開。蔚為國光。佇觀厥成。匪僅增加土產物品銷賣之效率。兼在誘導國人服用國貨之本能。久形委頓之國貨生機。至是遂呈扶搖直上之象。前途發揚。將靡有涯。敢於展𨋃之始。略貢蒭蕘之獻。</p>
<p>過去國貨不能暢銷之原因。固由一部分人士狃於矜視舶來之心理。以為遠致皆勝。近挹卽窳。輕重倒置。原堪扼腕。然在國貨本身。未能改良質料。促進技術。亦誠有難辭共咎者。考其所以不能改進之故。或限於資力週轉之貧匱。只能以因陋就簡之方法。粗制濫造而應市。或基於商業信義之缺乏。不恤以偷工减料之故技。朦蔽一時之耳目。更有少數齷齪駔儈。覬圖些微蠅頭之利。竟以舶來之劣品。冒充國貨而求售。一經發覺。無不爽然。為淵驅魚。厥罪尤浮。凡此皆足為國貨推廣產銷之障碍國人猶豫不前之主因。今國貨聯營公司。經官商合組而成立。具卓犖恢閎之規模。資源雄厚。魄力深䆳。而主持其事之人物。又於社會夙著聲望。或身通工藝之技巧。或曾受文化之陶冶。旣非低級商人可比。宜具高掌遠蹠之思。對於出品之如何改良。工場之如何整頓。產銷之如何合作。奸欺之如何防止。均應與關係方面有切實之聯絡。謀嚴密之管制。務使已往弊端盡革。新生機能暴茁。而於售價一點。尤宜力求克己。曲從低廉。俾能適應購買。普及羣衆。忍目前之小絀。圖日後之大償。放遠眼光者必能鑒及於斯。</p>
<p>其次。關於公司內部之構接。同業相與之應付。亦誠有不能不予深切之注意者。以今日社會層次之複雜。人心譎幻之不齊。一事隔閡。每涉糾紛。遷延不决。遂致叢脞。而在規模較大之組織。尤覺未易控御一切。假令主持其事者。能以誠摯相要結。以信義為依歸憑機會均等之原則謀聯擊平衡之發展。則未來隱憂。庶可倖免。絕爾詐念。示我信心。齋志一德。提携邁進。以共造國貨聯營之峯極以底於成功。</p>

<h3>黃峭崗上將軍廟</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>—山行雜什—</p>
<p>現在，我們是歇在黃蛸崗的李家店棧里，這黃峭崗要以行程來說，本來算不上是住宿的所在，至多當過路的人飢渴的時候，打上一回尖，歇歇腿，哨兩條玉蜀米，再來碗豆腐花，却十分相當•假使住宿的話，一兩個人還可對付，大批人馬就有點不堪招架•然而這些，我們顧不了，“上不着村，下不着店”，也只好停留下來。</p>
<p>這地方，統共不到百十戶人家，出了街口，就能看見黄峭崗的雄姿，牠不高，像灣背的老人把前胸緊伸到底下的面上。河呢？不窄，約摸着總有五六丈河寬，沖擊着河里的碎石，刷刷地向下面流去。這些時的水淺了，兩邊露出了碎沙河底，岸堤低得可憐，沿河一面的房子都築在堤岸上。推開窗子，河光山色都很清晰的跳進眼底。</p>
<p>在沿街北的房子的背後有一間小廟，廟里供奉的不是山神，也不是菩薩，倒是非常年青的兩個孩子，面前的燭台老早的失去了踪跡，灰沙堆積得有幾分厚，臉部已經看不清楚，身體也殘缺不全了。小屋自然也斑剝得不堪，心里想，在建造的當初或者是為了什麼特殊的事蹟，而這事蹟因了年久境遷，被放置在落沒的命運里。</p>
<p>夜了，一條銀河開了圍繞的星光，擠眼的像河面上閃動的金點，沒有月華，四周沉穆得能聽見樹葉落地的聲息。搬兩絛長橙子和店老板坐在街口上，讓靜夜的雨露洒下了背脊，流雲隨着晚間的凉風，輕輕地過去了。</p>
<p>談話里，該感謝他告訴沿街房後的那間小廟呌做“將軍廟”由建造到如今，記不得究竟有多少年代。所謂“將軍”，可以說是犧牲的酬勞，這里面，正包含了一個悲壯的不可思議的故事！</p>
<p>這條河在從前比現在還寬闊，在流匯併到一起，那波濤却非常汹湧的，經過多少次的修築，河流小了，再也揚不起從前的怒波。每年，當水漲時節，這里的居民就常時的埋在水里，可愛的農田成了水潭，退不下去，輕點的五六個村子，重點的蔓延開，那被難的更不堪想像。</p>
<p>街東住着張李兩姓人家，都有個獨生的兒子，一個呌“擋牢”，另一個呌“得住”，兩人的年紀差不多，大概在十歲左右的樣子。有那麼一年，這條河又不受指使的發了威，連夜，村子里的人不敢睡下去，門板，橙子……隨便什麼都好，擋住了被衝破的缺口，一面飛報上去，然而，人少力薄，漸次的不能支持，等官廳派人來的時候，水已經淹有半個人深了。</p>
<p>那位縣官事先曾做了個夢，說是這村子里的擋牢和得住可以阻治此次的水難，於是，他四處的搜尋着，結果，這兩個孩子作了是前綫的砲灰，而水漫也就平復下去。為了表示這莫大的功勳，把廟子築在街口上，領受村人的膜拜，並且，還賜以“將軍”的封號！</p>
<p>對這不可思議的事蹟我不想置議，在當時是不是這樣的情節，不能知道。神權的力量到現在仍舊支配這古𣝢的鄉間，廟子是破敗得不成樣了，而黃峭崗下的河流却依然的冲擊着，碎石，刷刷地向下面流去，要是再有發水的一天，恐怕連“將軍廟”都要受難了吧？</p>
<h3>旅途</h3>
<p>— 張海</p>
<p>東方現出了魚肚的白光時，我們就收拾起程，打算趕黑兒到內外蒙古交界的“加格賽”地方。告別了寂然無聲的“卡多村，”向原野的遠方前進了。昨夜“卡多村”的牧人告訴我們，往前去路好走得多了，所以我們决計步行，祇僱兩匹駱駝獻行李。四月的下弦月照着沉睡的草原，我們旅人的淡影也在草地拂過，那麼寂寞，那麼憂鬰的。月光漸漸淡褪了，晨曦從東方地平綫上升起來，原野的顏色慢慢的鮮明了。駝蹄和人的咳嗽聲，不時劃着靜穆的世界。露露完全恢復了她三天前的健康，天𠤤愉快的唱着故鄉的情歌，夢也似的，那麼甜蜜，那麼美滿。顯然的，清新的空氣灌注了每個人的胸懷，彷彿給精神打了嗎啡針潘萊斯基•克威爾•我•三個人津津有味的講談着“伏爾迦”河岸的民間故事，露露總是又要聽故事又耍嘴裏哼歌子。瀋萊斯基滿肚子裝着故事，有各種風味不同的民間故事，講起來有聲有色，使人聽了能得到極深刻的印象，尤其可以從故事中知道某一個地方的民族性和人民生活。他遊歷了許多地方，高加索，烏克蘭，布里雅特蒙古。像巴黎，柏林他也到過，可是他厭煩那些都市，他喜歡“伏爾迦河，喜歡西伯利亞大森林。</p>
<p>一路走，一路講談，誰都忘記了疲乏。走出卡多村十多里遠，到了一個山口，這山不大高，有樹和石塊。山底下有一道溪流，婉蜓的向平原的東方伸展去。澈清澈清的流水，濺濺的嗚着彷彿要調劑這草原上的寂寞。溪岸上的胡桐樹，開放着紫色的棉絮一般的花兒一陣陣的吐出芬芳的氣息。展在目前的是青蕪蕪的草原，碧綠的海面似的平坦無際。在遠處有放牧的牲口羣，偶爾傳來馬的嘶聲。我們就溪邊的草地上坐了，駱駝在咕咚咕咚的喝水，我們興高彩烈的唱着伏爾迦船夫曲”。露露撒野的在草上打滾，狂呼，跟克威爾趕趟兒（一個跑一個追），這時太陽巳經半天高了，滿山滿野都洒遍了陽光。最後我們手攙手的上山去，而且都準備了槍。奇怪，這山上沒有野獸，連兔子都見不到•鳥却很多，而且都是不知名的，在樹枝間飛來飛去，尖聲的歌唱着，牠們在頌揚春光呢。</p>
<p>我們歡快的迎着陽光向前行，路上一直沒有遇到沙原，所以走路一點也不吃力，尤其是潘萊斯基，他簡直像一雙鸚鵡不住嘴的說，總是些使人興奮的故事，他確是最了解旅行人的心理，旅行人是不需要悲劇的故事的。克威爾是頂喜歡聽女人的故事，潘萊斯基一講到高加索的女人時，他就細心側耳的聽着，早忘了和露露逗着玩了。</p>
<p>從從容容的到了“加格賽井”，恰巧太陽落山了。這裹有水吃，有柴燒，而且牧民慷慨的給我們住處和供我們飲食•起初牧民很驚異，為什麼有美國人在內？後來我們給他們解釋了；我們是到新疆去的，從這裹路過，克威爾雖是美國人，可是他在布里雅特住得很久了，在三年前他就入了布里雅特蒙古籍。於是牧民快活了，熱誠的招待我們。</p>
<p>留戀不捨的離開“加格賽并”，走了六十多里，才到了“蘇呼圖井”。其實這不能算是井，僅僅是泉水，深二三尺，水分中含有鹹性。喝起來味道挺不好。沿泉水前走，是一處山，山麓有五棵大樹，都生着密茂的綠葉。</p>
<p>經過“沙兒腦海”又走了十幾里的沙濠，方才達到“盛發魁”。“盛發魁”本來是個商店的名字。原係山西人所開設的，年久了，這商號就成地方的名字•過去“盛發魁”便是一片蜿蜓的矮山，曲曲灣灣。山下有山溝，溝裹有榆樹，枝繁業茂。我們就留此地午餐。</p>
<p>在“鳥蘭陶爾海”打聽了往新疆去的路程，我們决計不走寗夏境內，想從此地一直西行。</p>
<h3>取締工人出國</h3>
<p>— 方克文</p>
<p>歐戰時期，中國得能沾“公理戰勝”的餘光的，據說便在派遣工人出國援助協約國作戰這一點上。風氣所播，出國“為工為小販”，便也成了在國內無法覓得麵包者的出路之一了。可是近來這一條路卻也有“此路不通”之概，各國因自身的內在的矛盾，失業者漸漸地多了起來，自己的人民既無飯吃，自然不允許有別國的僑民來分我杯羹，這之間，尤其是“弱小民族”的中國僑胞，便時常被大批的“遣送”回國。被送回來的呢，則大都是以青田永嘉籍的居多數，因為他們在國外大都是“為工為小販”，而生活又簡單，工資自低，更兼忍苦耐勞，打罵都不大會反抗，這於資本家的利潤上，就有絕大好處，遠非本國工人所能及，但是於資本家的好處雖多，於所在國的政府却也更多麻煩，於補救失業問題諸多未便，為了消極的補救方便起見，他們便被遣送回國了。至於留學生們或是派送出洋考察什麼去的，因為是消費者，當然歡迎之不暇，那裹還肯驅逐。</p>
<p>但是奇怪得很，現在又有“大批無賴在溫州沿海各地，以歐洲獲利之容易，生活之舒適為宣傳，”向“壯健有用工人”游說了•說是“意大利郵船公司，於本月份起優待華人，凡每次有一百人出國者，可將船價對折計算，茍到意後無工可做，亦可由意人派往阿比西尼亞開墾荒地，可獲巨量工資”云。</p>
<p>這游說的力量想來很不小，從溫籍士紳的呈文外交部“迅予阻止”一點看來，便可想見，據士紳們呈請“迅予阻止”的理由，則是“該工人等出國之後，非流落於異邦，卽娶妻生子，久居海外，致本鄉土地漸次荒蕪，對於地方建設，不免蒙其影響”，而據調查結果，則“已到意國者，約有一萬多人，倘若每月如有工人源源出口，則三數年之後，溫州必成老幼之區”云•</p>
<p>中國是個農業國家，而農民是大都有保守性的，現在居然背背井離鄉，到人地徐疏的“異邦”去做工，這其中的原因，就頗值得我們加以思慮；紳士們好像頗担心“本鄉土地漸次荒蕪”，這足見關懷桑梓之般，然而，如果“本鄉土地”現在並不“渐次荒芜”或是有其他說不出的苦衷，我想這些鄉民們也不見得一定甘願到“異邦”去過流浪生活的。</p>
<p>然而現在他們却好像頗受“流浪”的“宣傳”所煽動，放棄“對於地方建設的重任”，要到“異邦”去“娶妻生子”去了，這在我們規定三項阻止辦法之餘，似乎倒也不妨細細地想一下，或者，實地查考一下：</p>
<p>他們為什麼甘願遠隔重洋的到“阿比西尼亞開墾地”去呢？</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Wang Chonghui arrived at the Executive Yuan at 9 a.m. on the 12th to handle official business, then attended the Yuan's memorial week, addressing all staff members. At 11 a.m., he met with King Saud and Ma Heng. In the afternoon at 3 p.m., he went to the Yuan to preside over the 308th regular meeting, which was convened ahead of schedule. Wang's address stated briefly: "I have been ordered to act as acting President, and today is my first meeting with all colleagues. I would like to simply explain two points of my hope: ① I hope that the President will recover his health as soon as possible so that all government affairs can be carried out and the hopes of the people can be fulfilled; ② I hope that all colleagues will uphold the President's spirit of service and work harder during the President's leave of absence to improve administrative efficiency." Improving administrative efficiency involves two aspects: rationalization and economization. Rationalization means reducing complicated procedures and seeking simplicity and speed in handling affairs. Economization, in addition to saving unnecessary expenses in terms of money for national defense and economic construction, also emphasizes the importance of time economy. The progress of world science has the same goal: to achieve maximum results with minimal consumption or labor. The same applies to administration. We should serve the country with our utmost personal efforts. What can be done today should be completed today and not left for tomorrow, and we should constantly seek progress and break the old mentality of maintaining the status quo, etc. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<p>Each Storage Facility to have Two Custodians; Service Rules for Custodians Formulated</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After the Preparatory Committee for Issuance received the issuance reserves of the Central, China, Communications, and China Farmers' Banks, they were originally to be stored centrally in a storage facility built by the Committee. However, the Committee believed that this construction would take a considerable amount of time, and the Central Reserve Bank is about to be reorganized, making it difficult to know how the issuance reserve storage method will be in the future. To facilitate the current storage of these reserves, the above-mentioned four banks have been entrusted as storage facilities for the Committee. To be cautious, it was also agreed with the Ministry of Finance to set up two custodians in each storage facility, one from each side, and service rules for the custodians were formulated and ordered to be followed.

<h3>Public Trial of Assassination Attempt on Wang</h3>
<p>Debate to Begin Today</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After the capture of the perpetrators of the assassination attempt on Wang, Yu Likui, Hu Dahai, Zhou Shiping, Hu Changming, Zhang Guoping, and Xu Yaoying, they were handed over to the Capital District Court by the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for custody and prosecution. In addition, Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Li Huaicheng, Xiang Zhonglin, and Lu Qingqi, who had already been arrested, were prosecuted by the Procuratorate of the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Except for Zhang and He, who were sentenced to seven years in prison and deprived of civil rights for seven years for organizing a group with the aim of endangering the Republic of China, the part of Zhang et al. concerning homicide was also transferred to the Capital District Court for trial due to a jurisdictional error. The court organized a collegiate bench on the morning of the 12th, consisting of Presiding Judge Gao Weijun, Judges Deng Shisun and Li Wenwei, Prosecutor Zhang Weidong, and Clerk Yu Huali, to conduct a public trial. After Presiding Judge Gao asked the defendants their names, ages, and native places, and Prosecutor Zhang Weidong announced the main points of the indictment, individual questioning began. According to the indictment of the Procuratorate against the defendant Yu, the charges included: ① Participating in an association with the purpose of committing crimes; ② Inciting soldiers to violate discipline; ③ Murder; ④ Aiding and abetting murder. However, the defendant subtly and cunningly argued against the important points of the crime, such as the assassination of Wang and Song, the organization of an assassination group, and the incitement of soldiers, hoping to evade responsibility. Hu Dahai and Zhou Shiping were then questioned, and they both denied any knowledge of the assassination plan or the organization of an assassination group. Later, Zhang Yuhua was questioned and claimed to have no knowledge of the Morning Light Society's plot to assassinate. Later, he admitted to sympathizing with Sun Fengming's intense desire to carry out an assassination but then claimed to have opposed Sun's assassination action, his intention being nothing more than to reduce his responsibility. By this point, it was already 11:40 a.m., and Presiding Judge Gao announced an adjournment, with the trial to resume at 2 p.m. In the afternoon of the 12th, the trial resumed at 2 p.m., and He Poguang, Liu Shurui, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, Lu Qingqi, Hu Changming, Zhang Guoping, Xu Yaoying, and others were questioned one after another. They mostly offered evasive words and denials. By 5 p.m., all twelve defendants had been questioned, and the presiding judge announced an adjournment, setting the debate to begin at 9 a.m. on the 13th. The transcripts of the court hearings of the twelve defendants on the 12th also need to be organized and will be read out on the 13th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<h3>Hope for the Future of National Products Joint Venture</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The National Products Joint Venture Company, prepared by the Economic Reconstruction Commission, was tentatively established yesterday. Official and commercial directors and supervisors were separately nominated. The first standing committee meeting was also convened, deciding on the selection of general and deputy managers and passing a general outline of business methods. It is also reported that the company plans to actively supplement the twelve national products companies that have been established in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, and to add seventeen new companies in the capital, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places. It is predicted that the grand plan will be widely spread and that great achievements will be made, bringing glory to the nation. It will not only increase the efficiency of selling local products, but also guide the inherent ability of the Chinese people to use domestic goods. The long-depressed vitality of national products will thus present an upward trend. The future development will be limitless. I dare to offer some humble suggestions at the beginning of this great undertaking.</p>
<p>In the past, the reason why national products could not be sold well was that some people were obsessed with looking down on imported goods, thinking that distant things were always better and that things nearby were always inferior. It was regrettable to reverse the importance of things. However, the fact that national products themselves failed to improve quality and promote technology also made it difficult to escape shared blame. The reason why they could not improve was either due to the lack of capital turnover, which forced them to use simple methods, roughly manufacture and flood the market, or due to the lack of commercial integrity, which made them use the old trick of cutting corners to deceive people temporarily. Even more, a few despicable merchants coveted small profits and even pretended to sell inferior imported goods as domestic products. Once discovered, everyone was disappointed. Driving fish into the deep, their crime was even greater. All of these are enough to hinder the promotion and production of national products and are the main reason why Chinese people hesitate to move forward. Now, the National Products Joint Venture Company is established by the joint efforts of officials and businessmen and has a prominent and ambitious scale. It has abundant resources and profound strength. The people in charge of it have a long-standing reputation in society, either possessing the skills of technology or having been cultivated by culture. They are not comparable to low-level merchants and should have lofty ambitions. They should have close contact with the relevant parties to discuss how to improve products, how to rectify factories, how to cooperate in production and sales, and how to prevent fraud, and they should implement strict management to ensure that past malpractices are eliminated and new functions are developed vigorously. In terms of price, they should strive to be self-restrained and follow low prices to adapt to purchases and popularize to the masses. Enduring small losses at present will lead to great compensation in the future. Those with a long-term vision will surely see this.</p>
<p>Secondly, the internal structure of the company and the response to fellow traders deserve serious attention. Given the complexity of today's social strata and the unevenness of people's hearts, a gap in one thing often leads to disputes, which are delayed and unresolved, leading to trivialities. In larger organizations, it is even more difficult to control everything. If those in charge can unite with sincerity, rely on integrity, and seek joint strikes and balanced development based on the principle of equal opportunities, then future hidden worries can be avoided. Eliminate fraudulent thoughts and show us confidence. Dedicate ourselves to one virtue, carry each other forward, and jointly create the peak of national products joint venture to achieve success.</p>
<h3>Japanese General Election Enters Second Stage</h3>
<p>Joint Front of Political and People's Parties Clearly Opposes the Government</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The political battle has entered the second stage, and the work of nominating candidates by various factions is almost over. Each party believes that it has a good chance of winning. The Minseito party has raised the slogan "From the general election to the general resignation," and the banner against the government is very clear. Since President Machida and other election committee members have been deliberating on the recognized candidates at the headquarters for several days, as of the 11th, 152 candidates have been officially recognized. They are now working hard to organize the candidates of their party, hoping that the total number will reach 300. However, as a result of strict selection, the total number of recognized personnel is likely to be limited to about 250. In the last election, the Minseito party fielded 253 officially recognized candidates and 42 non-officially recognized candidates, and as a result, 205 people were elected. Therefore, if they can maintain the status quo this time, they can at least win about 210 or even 230 seats. If so, the party will still become the first party, and the formation of a central force in the political arena is expected to be great. The Seiyukai party is very angry and excited about the government's unconstitutional dissolution of the parliament. Under the three major banners of unanimously overthrowing the Hayashi cabinet and destroying the small faction groups winged by the current cabinet, it faces the political battle. It has now decided on more than 170 officially recognized candidates and will make additional decisions based on the recommendations of local branches. It is expected to end the recommendation work on the 15th, and roughly 250 people can be obtained. Counting the non-officially recognized candidates, it should reach about 280 people. It will try its best to maintain coordination with the "friendly party," the Minseito party, to avoid friction and prevent the government party from gaining the fisherman's benefit. It is confident that it will win about 190 seats without any problems. As for the Showakai party, it is trying to become the central force of the new party, with "winning the election first" as its principle. It also takes a strict selection approach to officially recognized candidates, hoping to win a minimum of 30 to 35 seats. The Social Masses Party has a very good opportunity, and the whole party is mobilizing to strive for a major leap forward. The number of elected people is expected to be around 40 in the end. The Kokumin Domei party aims to win about 20 seats to prepare for the general election. (Domen News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Decides on Election Slogans</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The government avoids active strategies for this general election, focusing on awakening the people's understanding of the current situation in order to achieve the results of a clean election. Therefore, it has decided to promote this policy to the people. As for its election slogans, it proposes the following three items: ㊀ Cast a conscious vote to open up the situation; ㊁ Understand the situation to promote Japan's leap forward; ㊂ Destroy private interests for the public good as the foundation of politics.

<h3>Chinese Embassy in London Rushes to Repair</h3>
<p>Can Be Completed When Special Envoy Kong Arrives in England</p>
<p>[London] The Chinese Embassy in London is now undergoing major repairs. The mansion was originally owned by Lord Walden and was leased by China for 999 years about 13 years ago. The building is old, but the decoration is very beautiful. Outside the hall are two large rooms, one for the embassy counselor, Dr. Chen Weicheng, and all the staff of the Secretariat, and one as a reception room. Portraits of Premier Li Hongzhang's grandson, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, hang inside, and a large screen inlaid with fine workmanship is placed. Beyond this room is the ambassador's study, and his private secretary is also located inside. Further ahead is the office of other staff members. The formal reception rooms are all located on the first floor, and above that is where the ambassador's family lives. The top floor has the room where Sun Yat-sen was in distress in 1896, which was later converted into a memorial hall. This floor has not been used for other purposes yet. Now, because the staff is gathering on the ground floor, it is very inconvenient, so it has been moved to this floor to work in separate rooms, and an elevator has been installed to facilitate going up and down. The two rooms vacated on the ground floor will be completely renovated, and an embassy reception room will be added. As for the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall on the top floor, it will of course be carefully preserved as before. Workers are now gathering in the embassy, ​​and the staff is directing everything, which is quite busy. It is hoped that when Special Envoy Kong, who is attending the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor, arrives, it will be completed. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 12th)</p>

<h3>Rebel Forces Implement Blockade of Northern Spanish Coast</h3>
<p>British Warships Arrive off the Port of Bilbao to Protect Domestic Merchant Shipping</p>
<p>⊙ Bayonne Port, Southern France The navy belonging to the Spanish Nationalist forces is currently implementing a blockade of the northern coast of the country, which is becoming increasingly effective. The warships participating include seven vessels, including the cruisers "Admiral Cervera," "España," and "Canarias." The yacht "Astata," belonging to the Spanish government forces, sailed out of Saint-Jean-de-Luz port in southern France and repeatedly attempted to break through the blockade line, but failed and returned to Bayonne port to temporarily halt. The British cargo ship "Macgregor" arrived at this port from Britain yesterday and is also temporarily halting. Another British cargo ship, "Seven Seas," carrying goods from Alicante port in eastern Spain to Bilbao port, received a wireless message from the British destroyer "Blanche" yesterday, relaying orders from the Admiralty instructing it not to approach the northern Spanish seaports. The ship changed course and sailed to Saint-Jean-de-Luz port in France. En route, it encountered the Nationalist cruiser "Admiral Cervera," which, after determining the merchant ship's nationality and destination, allowed it to pass, but continued to monitor it until it left the vicinity of Bilbao port, then turned back. At this time, several British cargo ships docked in Saint-Jean-de-Luz port had received a letter from the captain of the British destroyer "Blanche," relaying orders from the Admiralty instructing them not to leave the port and head to the northern Spanish ports. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>⊙ Bilbao Port The rumor that the seaports of the Basque Autonomous Region have been blockaded by Nationalist warships has been officially denied by officials, who said that the government forces have ample power to prevent any blockade attempts with their artillery and naval forces. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>⊙ Saint-Jean-de-Luz The British cruiser "Hood," weighing 41,000 tons, arrived off the port of Bilbao this afternoon. This ship is specifically here to protect British merchant ships. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>[London] Four British merchant ships, fully loaded with grain, sailed to Bilbao port in northern Spain, to be delivered to the government forces, but because the coast there is almost completely surrounded by the Nationalist navy, they could not proceed and sailed into Saint-Jean-de-Luz port in southern France to temporarily halt. Regarding this matter, according to sources close to the news, the Cabinet held an emergency meeting from 6 PM to 8 PM, and decided: 1) Not to recognize the Spanish Nationalist forces as having the rights of a belligerent party; 2) On the high seas, British merchant ships will be protected by British warships; 3) However, within Spanish territorial waters, British warships do not intend to escort domestic merchant ships; 4) British warships will protect British merchant ships carrying grain to Bilbao port, which is not contrary to the spirit of the non-intervention agreement. Therefore, if the warships belonging to the Spanish Nationalist forces interfere with British merchant ships, Britain will not tolerate it. Political figures have said that the largest battleship of the British Mediterranean Fleet, the "Hood" (43,000 tons), received emergency orders yesterday to sail from Gibraltar to the northern Spanish coast, which is related to this matter, and that Britain will adopt the toughest attitude to protect its own merchant ships, which can also be seen from this matter.

<h3>Spanish Government Requests British and French Assistance with Morocco as a Reward</h3>
<p>British and French Governments Reject the Request in Their Replies, Upholding the Principle of Non-Intervention</p>
<p>[London] The British and French governments have published their replies to the previous diplomatic note from the Spanish government, requesting assistance in the country's civil war, offering certain rights in Spanish Morocco as a reward. The British and French governments have unanimously rejected the Spanish government's request. The Spanish diplomatic note was dated February 9th, but it was not known to the outside world until the Nationalist radio station in Salamanca broadcast the news on March 17th. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>British Reply</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the diplomatic note submitted by the Spanish government to Britain, requesting the British government's practical support in quelling the civil unrest, offering certain privileges in Spanish Morocco, Britain has now submitted a reply, expressing its refusal to accept these privileges, and stating that all Spanish interests can only be fully protected under the condition that the government in Valencia makes every effort to prevent foreign intervention in the Spanish civil unrest. At the same time, it strongly stated that the British government adheres to the policy of non-intervention and will not waver. Regarding the other issues mentioned in the diplomatic note, please put them aside for the time being and raise them for discussion after the situation has stabilized. (National Maritime Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>French Reply</p>
<p>[Paris] The general meaning of the French government's reply can be divided into the following points: 1) The Spanish government's desire to base its foreign policy on international cooperation, especially with Western democracies, is very satisfactory to France. 2) The complete prohibition of any foreign intervention in the Spanish civil war is a common goal of the Spanish proposal and French policy. 3) The withdrawal of foreign volunteers currently fighting in Spain is a principle that the French representative has been striving to advocate in the London Adjustment Committee. Now that the Spanish government has accepted it, the French government is naturally very pleased. The French government now hopes that this issue can be resolved with the participation of the Spanish government. 4) Regarding the issue of Spain's position in North Africa, the French government hereby informs the Spanish government that it is not impossible to resolve this issue politically, but it must wait until order is restored in Spain and then be initiated by the Spanish government before beneficial discussions can begin, and the solutions can only be considered if they do not conflict with the existing agreements between France and Spain on the Moroccan issue.

<h3>British Cabinet Discusses the Situation in Spain</h3>
<p>Not Recognizing the Rebel Forces as a Belligerent Party</p>
<p>[London] The Cabinet held an emergency meeting yesterday and has ordered the battleship "Hood," currently in Bilbao, to fire on Spanish rebel ships if necessary to protect British shipping. The ship arrived in Bilbao at midnight yesterday. Currently, the British government has not ordered the ship to break the rebel blockade, but it claims that it still does not recognize the rebel forces as a belligerent party, so they have no right to blockade the seaports. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that the Cabinet will not allow warships to escort the four food ships currently in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, or other ships in Spanish territorial waters. At the same time, according to reliable sources, after repeated persuasion from British Foreign Secretary Eden to Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi, and after British Ambassador to Italy Sir Drummond personally explained the advantages and disadvantages to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Mussolini has agreed to discuss the issue of withdrawing Italian volunteers in Spain. It is said that Mussolini's change of attitude is not unrelated to the rumor that Hitler wants to befriend Britain. Therefore, well-informed observers believe that if Italy makes any more stubborn statements in the future, it will only be to save face. It is said that Grandi has received instructions on how to save face, but some members of the Non-Intervention Committee still believe that although Italy's attitude has changed, it is still far from withdrawing volunteers, because Italy and Germany are still determined to prevent the "Reds" from winning in Spain. Prime Minister Baldwin or Foreign Secretary Eden will probably make an important announcement in the House of Commons soon regarding the situation of the blockade of the Spanish seaports. A certain spokesperson said that the government's attitude should be based on what is announced to Parliament, and other rumors are confirmed as speculation. As for the legal issues of the blockade of the seaports, they are extremely complicated. According to Britain's traditional policy, if British ships are intercepted and attacked by other ships at sea, it can be regarded as piracy, but so far the government has not ordered the naval authorities to protect shipping within Spanish territorial waters. It is understood that Britain may unofficially request General Franco to recognize Bilbao as a protected area, similar to Barcelona, and not as a war zone, in order to resolve the current crisis.

<p>⊙ Madrid The government forces began a general offensive a few days ago, and today is the fourth day. The two armies are now engaged in trench warfare again. The government forces have made slight progress by repeatedly using hand grenades and bayonet charges. The focus of the fighting is still in the western suburbs. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid On the front lines in the suburbs of the capital, both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting. Government forces have broken into the Nationalist lines on Mount Garabitas in the western suburbs, and the Sierra de la Alqueria also seems to be surrounded by government forces. Heavy artillery fire is constantly heard in the front, with both sides using tanks, planes, and artillery in the battle. The intensity of the fighting is unprecedented since the outbreak of the civil war. Government forces have also been successful in their attacks on the front lines in Escorial to the northwest of the capital and Guadalajara to the northeast.

<p>⊙ Bilbao Front Government forces in Bilbao launched two counterattacks against the rebel general Mola's troops to the north today, but were repulsed. After Mola's troops advanced to Mount Sebigen, they were digging trenches to set up new positions. Government forces took advantage of their unpreparedness to launch an attack. The rebel forces were in a precarious situation for a time, but quickly deployed a fresh force to attack the government forces from the rear. The government forces were attacked from both sides and were unable to withstand the attack, and retreated. (National News Agency Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Parliamentary By-Election Results in a Major Victory for Janson</h3>
<p>The Cabinet's Position is Further Consolidated, a Major Blow to Fascism</p>
<p>⊙ Brussels Prime Minister Janson and Rex Party leader Degrelle competed for a seat in Parliament in the by-election. Tonight, the results were announced amidst an atmosphere of excitement. Janson won the election by a large majority, with 275,840 votes, while Degrelle received 69,242 votes. Janson received 206,598 more votes than Degrelle. Degrelle's votes only accounted for 19.05% of the total number of voters. In order to prevent incidents from occurring, the authorities in Brussels deployed 2,000 semi-military police to be prepared for everything, but fortunately no disturbances occurred. Every voter is required to vote, otherwise they will have to pay a fine, but there were still as many as 18,358 blank and invalid votes, although this number is less than the last general election. Janson's platform is that the whole country must cooperate in order to achieve economic and financial recovery. Before the election, the Rex Party launched a major campaign, distributing 40 tons of propaganda materials in one day. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>This election is a major turning point for the reputation of the current government and the future of Belgian governance. The election results show that the Rex Party ultimately failed, which was unexpected by the outset. Therefore, general observers believe that the position of the Janson cabinet and the democratic system of Belgium will be greatly strengthened. After the election results were announced, Prime Minister Janson issued a statement to the voters of Brussels, saying, "The government should now carry on the work of rebuilding the country and benefiting the people with greater determination and a stronger will, in order to live up to the trust of the people. This is how it has been in the past, and this is how it will be in the future. Now that the national policy has been set and the public's discussions have subsided, the government can lead the country to a prosperous future and give the Belgian people the confidence to protect their common homeland."

<p>The People of Brussels are in High Spirits</p>
<p>⊙ Brussels After the results of the by-election for members of parliament in the city were announced, the streets of the city were crowded with people in high spirits. Some people gathered in large crowds, but they dispersed peacefully after being dispersed by the police. Most residents then marched in groups, and some even dressed up and played the role of Degrelle and the Rex Party going to a funeral, in order to ridicule them. This situation is more similar to a carnival than a political demonstration. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>The Fascist Leader Issues a Statement</p>
<p>⊙ Brussels After his defeat in this election, Rex Party leader Degrelle issued a statement in the party's newspaper today, saying, "Although Cardinal Mercier made statements attacking the Rex Party at the last moment of the pre-election, causing some voters to be influenced by it and hesitate, the Rex Party's movement is still resolutely proceeding. Those voters who were able to maintain their principles despite the interference of the Church are the best fighters in the future, and their number accounts for 20% of the city's population, so the importance of this matter cannot be ignored. As for why his political enemies won, it was simply because they had a larger number of people, and the reason why they had a larger number of people was because their common fear and hatred of the Rex Party made Catholics, communists, liberals, and conservatives form a united front, but the collapse of this front can be expected immediately. The strong nationalist faction will soon take on the great task of saving the country." (National Maritime Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>British and French Newspapers Express Satisfaction</p>
<p>[London] After Prime Minister Janson was elected in the by-election for members of parliament in the Brussels district of Belgium, the newspapers here all expressed satisfaction. "The Times" reported that Prime Minister Janson's election was not only a victory for him personally, but also a victory for Belgian democracy. As for the Fascist Rex Party leader, who originally wanted to win a spiritual victory, he has now suffered a spiritual defeat. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that some people believe that the world's democratic politics are currently engaged in a final battle, and the results of the election in Brussels should be a source of encouragement for them. The "News Chronicle" reported that the period of Fascist rampage in Belgium should be expected to end after this election, which is a very satisfying thing for the situation in Belgium and all of Europe. The "Daily Herald" reported that the results of this election in Belgium meant that the country had already broken free from the shackles of Fascism. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The newspapers here unanimously expressed satisfaction with the results of the by-election in Belgium. Among them, the left-wing newspapers in particular regarded it as a victory for the Belgian nation. The Radical Socialist "L'Ère nouvelle" reported, "Yesterday's" scene was not only a major blow to Degrelle personally, but dictators should also know to be on guard. "L'Ordre" reported, "The true national thought of Belgium has defeated false nationalism." The Socialist "Le Peuple" reported, "This is a failure of international Fascism." The Communist "L'Humanité" reported, "The voters of Brussels have struck down Rex Party's Hitler (referring to Degrelle)." In addition, the right-wing "L'Ami du Peuple" said, "Yesterday's scene is beneficial to the French governance system and world peace." "Le Petit Parisien" also claimed, "The results of yesterday's election in Brussels show that liberalism has won a great victory. As for the failure of Degrelle's election, even a certain dictatorial country must be greatly shocked." "Le Petit Journal" stated, "The comedy has now come to an end. Prime Minister Janson is knowledgeable, far-sighted, and tirelessly devoted to the country's reconstruction efforts. Now the people of the country are united once again to support this glorious leader." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<h3>Germany's Foreign Economic Relations (Continued from yesterday)</h3>
<p>Devaluation of Foreign Currencies Disadvantages German Trade; Germany is Ready to Conclude Commercial Treaties with Other Countries at Any Time</p>
<p>The negotiations that Germany continued with various parties last year were indeed necessary, and sometimes simultaneous contact was made with several countries. For those on the German side responsible for negotiations, this type of commercial negotiation was a particularly thorny task, because the interests of the countries involved had to be reconciled with Germany's planned needs with the greatest difficulty. The Four-Year Plan announced by Chancellor Hitler at the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress on September 9, 1936, was thought by some foreign observers at the time to indicate Germany's intention to gradually withdraw from international trade activities. In fact, this was completely contrary to the truth, as solemnly stated by Hitler himself in his speech to the Reichstag on January 30, 1937. Indeed, the Four-Year Plan currently being implemented by Germany will enable Germany to save foreign exchange in various ways. However, in view of Germany's unlimited ability to consume foreign food and raw materials, the foreign exchange it saves will certainly be used to purchase large quantities of other foreign goods, so as to improve the living standards of the German people. Therefore, an increase in the import of foreign goods will certainly be welcomed. Germany is therefore ready to conclude long-term credit commercial treaties with foreign countries at any time. Therefore, in the year we are currently reviewing, the point to be emphasized is the increase in world market prices. In some countries, in addition to the continuous increase in private consumption, government and public orders have also increased significantly, especially for goods required for military expansion. The scale of this is far beyond what could have been imagined in previous peacetime eras. Various large industries that had been suspended due to the world economic panic have been fully restored to activity due to this development, and in some countries, certain sectors of their industries have also been working to their fullest extent again. However, accompanying this type of activity is the gradual increase in the price level of raw materials. This development is naturally unfavorable for countries that lack raw materials, such as Germany. At a time when the international market continues to develop, a number of countries have adopted currency devaluation policies, which have created significant problems. However, Germany has been able to overcome these difficulties, so there is no reason to reform its monetary policy. However, Germany's foreign trade has been greatly affected by the devaluation of other countries' currencies, because changes in the price level are indeed unfavorable to Germany. However, this impact not only affects countries on the passive side, but also the countries that implement this policy. The currency devaluation policies adopted by the United Kingdom and the United States were implemented at a time when raw material prices were falling and general prices were showing a downward trend. However, in 1936, when prices rose and the market was booming, some countries also implemented the same policy. This measure has further increased the general price level of countries that have already adopted devaluation policies, and in some respects, this upward trend already existed before the currency devaluation was implemented, so that the rise in the price level reached the same proportion as the previous devaluation. However, through this continuous rise in prices, the unfavorable results of the currency devaluation policy suffered by Germany have also been considerably balanced. It should also be mentioned that Germany has also been quite active in trade policy over the past year. Among the trade agreements concluded in 1936, the most noteworthy should be the provisional commercial treaty and payment agreement concluded with Canada on October 22. This agreement has considerably compensated for the shortcomings of the organizational system of German trade relations. However, on the other hand, the problem of rebuilding German-French freight relations on the basis of trade agreements has not been fundamentally resolved. At the same time, there is still no appropriate solution to the trade relations between Germany and the United States. As for Germany's trade with its two major important neighbors, although it has recently decreased slightly, it can now be placed on a new and satisfactory basis. Because the provisional commercial treaty concluded with Austria in the summer of 1936, the commercial agreement concluded on January 27 of this year, and the agreement concluded with Lithuania on August 5, 1936, have all been able to fulfill the hopes of the parties concerned to exchange goods and reach a satisfactory level in the shortest possible time. Generally speaking, the political structure of Germany's various commercial agreements has been satisfactorily developed in 1936 through the extension and amendment of agreements. At the same time, the practical cooperation of delegations sent by various governments has enabled the current commercial treaties to adapt to any changing environment, and German trade has therefore not experienced any reversals. These are the most significant achievements of the past year. In short, Germany should regard its foreign economic relations in the past year as a success and believes that it will be able to develop favorably in the coming year as well.

<h3>Gandhi's Proposal</h3>
<p>Organize an Arbitration Tribunal to Resolve Indian Disputes</p>
<p>⊙ Walter H. Gandhi, in a meeting with Reuters reporters today, suggested organizing an arbitration tribunal to decide whether provincial governors should comply with the Congress Party's request to guarantee that they will not exercise the special powers granted to them by the constitution. (The Congress Party has made this guarantee a condition for taking office in the provincial governments.) The tribunal should consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by the Congress Party, one appointed by the British government, and these two members should have the power to appoint a third arbitrator. Gandhi also stated that he was unaware of the Indian government's laws and the Select Committee's report. His advice to the Congress Party to take office under conditions was based on the opinion of the Congress Party's lawyers, who believed that the provincial governors could give guarantees without violating Indian law. He also intended to submit the question of whether the currently formed provincial governments are legal to the arbitration tribunal he proposed. If the British government accepts this proposal, he will advise the Congress Party to accept it as well. What he wants is to demonstrate fairness, and there is no diplomatic issue involved. This is a matter of life and death for India. Now the British authorities must accept proceeding along the right path in order to achieve India's goals. Only then can the Congress Party take office. If the Congress Party does not obtain the guarantee of the provincial governors, and the British authorities trample on small and weak nations, or restore tyrannical rule in other ways, then organizing provincial governments would be tantamount to digging its own grave.

<h3>Japanese Fleet Conducts War Games in the Seas off Fujian and Guangdong</h3>
<p>Wada Commands, Kondo Inspects; More Than 20 Warships Participate</p>
<p>Shantou Communication: The 13th and 6th Destroyer Squadrons of the Japanese Navy in Taiwan, led by Rear Admiral Okuma Masayoshi, arrived in Shantou on the 2nd and anchored in the waters of Kizaki Island. At 4 p.m. on the 6th, they suddenly sailed out of Mayu Harbor again on their own. They did not notify when they arrived, nor did they say goodbye when they left. For a time, rumors in Chaozhou and Shantou were rampant. The Maritime Police Inspectorate increased its personnel and established a passport inspection office for foreigners entering the country. The Standard Oil, Asiatic Petroleum, and Texaco oil depots on the coast of Kizaki Island were also ordered to move to a place further away from the urban area to avoid danger. Rear Admiral Okuma Masayoshi is the commander of the 5th Torpedo Squadron of the Japanese 3rd Fleet. When he arrived in Shantou, he did not go ashore to visit the local mayor. Only on the evening of the 5th, Yamazaki Seiichiro, the Japanese consul in Shantou, accompanied by Goda Ho, Hayashi Yoshio, and other leaders of the Japanese residents in Shantou, held a meeting on the Yubari warship to report on overseas Chinese affairs and the recent situation of negotiations on various pending cases between China and Japan in Shantou. It is said that the captains of the Sanae, Utake, Waktake, Fuyou, Karukaya, and Asagao warships were all present. By the 6th, after the warships had sailed out of Mayu Harbor, they held exercises. It is said that on the sea surface at the junction of Fujian and Guangdong, Japanese warships patrolled around Nan'ao in groups of three or five. Japanese warships could also be seen in the nearby seas of Raoping, Zhao'an, and Dongshan. Rear Admiral Wada, who commanded the war games (the commander of the Mako Naval Port in Taiwan), arrived at Shantou Port at 11 p.m. on the 7th aboard the Harukaze warship. At 8 a.m. on the 8th, Yamazaki, the Japanese consul in Shantou, Obata, the secretary, and Takaji Saburo, the representative of the Japanese Residents Association, greeted him ashore and rested for a while at the Japanese consulate. At 9 a.m., they visited Mayor Huang Bingxun at the Municipal Government and inquired in detail about Shantou's economic and political construction. They left after about half an hour. Huang Jing, a counselor from the Municipal Government, guided them on a tour of the city for a week. At noon, the Japanese consulate hosted a banquet for Wada. At 2 p.m., the Japanese Residents Association held a general meeting to welcome him. Mayor Huang returned the visit to the Harukaze warship at 4 p.m. On the morning of the 9th, Wada left the port aboard the Harukaze warship to command the exercises in the seas off Guangdong and Fujian. It is said that because Rear Admiral Kondo had not arrived, Wada first went to Hong Kong and Guangdong, and then returned to Shantou to inspect the fleet at sea. According to sources from the Japanese here, Admiral Osumi, the Japanese Minister of the Navy, was originally scheduled to come south as a special envoy to inspect the navy, but later, due to lack of time, he changed his mind and sent Vice Admiral Kondo south. The large-scale exercise is scheduled for the 11th, and the location is from the waters of Penghu, Taiwan, directly to Shantou and Xiamen. The participating fleet includes more than 20 destroyers from the 4th, 5th, 13th, and 16th Destroyer Squadrons. The purpose is to target the coasts between Shantou and Xiamen. Nan'ao, Raoping, Zhao'an, and Dongshan counties have become the targets of this Japanese war game. After three consecutive days, the exercises will be completed on the 15th, and then an inspection ceremony will be held. People generally attach great importance to this Japanese fleet exercise.

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Finance Restricts Capital Inflow into North China</h3>
<p>Investments by Various Spinning Mills Total 100 Million Yuan; Fear of Impact on Foreign Exchange Leads to Restrictions on Outflow</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: This year, Japanese textile companies are investing in the establishment of spinning mills in North China like a whirlwind. As of this month, there are as many as thirteen companies that plan to purchase land near Tianjin to build factories. The number of companies that have purchased land in Qingdao to build factories is also not small. It is estimated that a total of about 100 million yuan has been invested in Tianjin and Qingdao. Of this, only one-tenth is for construction costs, and the rest is for machinery, equipment, and working capital. Moreover, these are all private economic enterprises and have nothing to do with the six-point program planned by the Japanese Army Headquarters in North China to develop the economy of North China. However, the various textile companies rely on the special influence of the Japanese Army Headquarters and the Japanese Consulate General in order to obtain and realize civil engineering projects and land purchases. This spring, the Japanese Ministry of Finance promulgated an order to manage foreign exchange and restrict capital outflow. Therefore, the large-scale outflow of capital from the Japanese textile industry has become a problem. It has expressed reluctance to remit cash to North China for various textile companies and intends to restrict it. However, the various textile companies are jointly submitting a request to the Ministry of Colonial Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for explanation. On the one hand, they are earnestly requesting the Japanese Army Headquarters to help them dredge the channels, saying that although the total investment of various companies is 100 million yuan, 90 million yuan of it is used to purchase domestic machinery and other items. In fact, only about 30% of the total amount flows into North China, excluding the 10 million yuan for construction costs in the local area. If this amount is viewed from an economic point of view, it can be returned to the country in no more than two years. Therefore, there is no need to worry too much about the excessive outflow of cash. It is reported that the Ministry of Colonial Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have also had nothing to say after the explanation, and only the Ministry of Finance still considers it necessary to consider it. Recently, the Wu Yu Spinning Co., Ltd. and the Kishiwada Textile Co., Ltd. are building factories in Tianjin. Due to domestic restrictions on foreign exchange, the construction work has not been carried out as scheduled. The Wu Yu Textile Co., Ltd. is a first-class company in the Japanese textile industry with a capital of 20 million yuan, of which 15.17 million yuan has been fully paid up, and has corporate bonds of 10 million yuan. Recently, it purchased 55,000 tsubo of land in Xiaoliuzhuang, a special district No. 3 in the suburbs of Tianjin (every 70 tsubo in Japanese degrees is equal to one mu in our country). It will prepare 60,000 spindles and 1,200 looms. For the purpose of building a factory, it plans to collect 4.43 million yuan of the following funds and increase capital by 10 million yuan. The Kishiwada Textile Co., Ltd. has purchased 100,000 tsubo of land in Balitai in the suburbs of Tianjin and plans to prepare 100,000 spindles and 5,000 looms. The construction work is divided into two phases. The total investment is planned to be 12 million yuan, the first phase is 7 million yuan, and the second phase is 5 million yuan. The company's capital is 9.75 million yuan, of which 7.2 million yuan has been fully paid up. In the future, in addition to collecting funds, it will also expand its capital by 10 million yuan. There is also the Osaka Kinka Textile Co., Ltd., which plans to find land to build a factory near Xiaolizhuang in Tianjin, with an investment of about 5 million yuan. It will set up 40,000 spindles and 1,000 looms. These three spinning mills are scheduled to start construction in June of this year, complete it around October, and start producing yarn at the end of the year. Now that the remittance of funds is restricted, it may not be possible to realize it as originally planned.</p>
<p>In addition to setting up a factory in Tianjin to spin yarn and flowers, the Dai Nippon Textile Co., Ltd. also plans to set up a cotton company with a capital of 5 million yuan, specializing in the purchase of cotton fields in Fengrun, Wangtian, Changli, Fushun, Qian'an, and other places in the pseudo-Ji-dong area, implementing improved cotton seeds, cooperating with rural areas, planting cotton, and supplying various spinning mills. The Japan Xingzhong Co., Ltd. will invest more than 3 million yuan to purchase land and build cotton warehouses along the river in the special district No. 3 to handle cotton mortgage loans and other matters. The above two matters are all in progress and can be completed recently. (10th)</p>
<h3>Liu Wenhui Discusses the Current Situation in Xikang</h3>
<p>The Entire Xikang is in Ruins After the Red Bandits Disturbed It; Security in Various Counties is Gradually Restored Through Continuous Reorganization</p>
<p>Chengdu Air Mail: Liu Wenhui, Chairman of the Xikang Provincial Construction Committee, issued a statement today (8th) saying that he first traveled to Kangding on November 12th of last year and returned to Ya'an on March 26th of this year. Because military affairs had to be dealt with, he was delayed in Ya'an for more than ten days and only returned to Chengdu yesterday (7th). Regarding the current situation in Xikang, the process of the four months after I arrived in Kangding, and how Xikang will be established in the future, such trivial matters and unresolved issues that need to be resolved are of course not suitable to be stated one by one. I can only make a general answer by grasping the key points. Xikang is a high, cold, and poor area. Its economy is still stagnating in the pastoral era. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, disputes between Kang and Tibet have occurred frequently, and the losses have been great. In the middle, it was severely disturbed by Nuona, and the transportation routes in northern Kang were completely suspended. The people suffered another deep pain. Finally, the Red Bandits broke into Kang territory and ravaged it wantonly. The people of the entire Kang were even more in dire straits, and the tragic situation is self-evident. Speaking of the territory of Xikang, there were originally 33 counties, one administrative bureau with 14 counties west of the Jinsha River, and another administrative bureau with 19 counties east of the Jinsha River. Since the Tibetan army invaded eastward at the beginning of the Republic of China, not only did it completely occupy the 14 counties of Qamdo west of the Jinsha River, but it also lost several counties east of the Jinsha River. By the 17th year of the Republic of China, when Cen Ren presided over the Kang government, only twelve and a half counties could implement administrative orders. After I gradually reorganized, counties such as Dengde and Baishi were recovered from the hands of the Tibetans, and the current ruling situation on the east bank of the Jinsha River was finally completed. At this time, because I was also in charge of the Sichuan government, in addition to military expenses, I had to allocate more than 200,000 yuan per month to subsidize Xikang. Since the 22nd year, the Sichuan provincial authorities have been unable to take care of it. In the 24th year, the Xikang Provincial Construction Committee was established. Under the ruling situation of 19 counties, there were successive chaos and difficulties. Especially in the areas disturbed by the Red Bandits, it was in ruins. Not only was there no grain left, but also nine out of ten livestock were lost. The severity of the disaster can be imagined. Now I have reported the general number of disaster situations and losses in various counties as follows:</p>
<p>Disaster Situation in Various Counties</p>
<p>Kangding: In October of the 24th year, a part of the Red Bandits, led by Lanzhou Tu from Luding, sneaked into Kangding. Another part, starting from Danba, exited Mao Niu Mountain and Dapu Mountain, and peeped into Kongyu along the way. The 16th Army guarded them in separate ways, and fortunately they did not succeed. They did not escape until March of the following year. It is estimated that 37 people were killed by the bandits, and the loss of rice, grain, livestock, and property totaled about 243,400 yuan. Danba: In May of the 24th year, the bandits sneaked into Zhuolang and other places in Danba from Luding. In October, they sneaked eastward from Maogong and captured the county seat. In March of the following year, bandits from Rongya, Tianlu, and Xiaojun in Chuan were severely suppressed by the government army and collected from the territory of Ba. They did not sneak north until mid-July. It is estimated that more than 600 people died in the fight against the bandits and were killed by the bandits, and more than 300 people were coerced. The loss of rice, grain, livestock, and property totaled about 784,500 yuan. Luding: In May of the 24th year, the bandits sneaked into Menghugang, Guihuaping, Moxi, Angzhou, and other places in the county from Huili and captured the county seat. In October, Zhu Xu and others joined forces in Maogong and sneaked into Lanzhou, Cadao, Wuliman, Gangou, and other areas of the county twice from Jintang and Danba. They sneaked north in May of the following year. It is estimated that more than 90 people were killed by the bandits, more than 200 people were coerced, 200 houses were burned down, 5,400 shi of rice and grain were lost, 80 rifles were lost, and the total loss of livestock and property was about 412,700 yuan. Daofu: In April of the 25th year, when the bandits sneaked into Danba, Nuona said in the county seat, Teng Piao Zhongshu, that he could resist the bandits, falsely raised troops and guns, but did not prepare at all, causing the bandits to invade the county and occupy it for four months. It is estimated that more than 10 people were killed by the bandits, 30 people were kidnapped, and the loss of rice, grain, livestock, and property totaled about 350,000 yuan (excluding the loss of Lingque Temple, the largest Lama temple). The guerrilla team of the Jiulong bandits roamed the area from Tai, Ning, along the east bank of the Yalong River to the junction of Ya and Jiu for a long time. It is estimated that 7 people were killed by the bandits, and the loss of rice, grain, livestock, and property totaled about 3,500 yuan. Yajiang: After Luo Binghui's troops entered the territory of Daofu, in May of the 25th year, they sneaked from the west bank of the Yalong River to the county seat upstream of the Yajiang River and then fell. It is estimated that 76 people were killed by the bandits, and the loss of rice, grain, livestock, and property totaled about 182,000 yuan. Qianhua: After Yajiang fell, the bandits sneaked into the county from Jia Sikon, and Nuona also disturbed the area. Nine out of ten houses were empty. It is estimated that 25 people were killed by the bandits, and the loss of rice, grain, livestock, and property totaled about 135,400 yuan. Lihua: After Qianhua fell, the bandits from Qian and Ya counties advanced westward at the same time, trying to join forces with Xiao He. In June of the 35th year, the county seat fell, and countless monasteries and civilian houses were destroyed. It is estimated that 36 civilians were kidnapped, 114 people died in the fight against the bandits, and the loss of rice, grain, houses, livestock, and property totaled about 144,800 yuan. Lu Huo: After the bandits captured Lihua and chased Nuona, the county seat was lost. It is estimated that 36 civilians were killed by the bandits, and the loss of rice, grain, livestock, and property totaled about 274,400 yuan (excluding the loss of Shouling Temple, the largest Lama temple, which was about 400,000 taels). Ganzi: The bandits organized a Boba government in the county seat, intending to stay for a long time. In May of the 25th year, they also sneaked north. It is estimated that 12 civilians were killed by the bandits, 7 people were kidnapped, and the loss of rice, grain, livestock, and property totaled about 286,400 yuan. Baiyu: The bandits occupied the county for more than three months. It is estimated that 3 civilians were killed by the bandits, more than 10 people were kidnapped, and the loss of rice, grain, livestock, and property totaled about 76,300 yuan. Daocheng and Dingxiang: In June of the 25th year, Xiao He's bandit troops peeped from Zhongdian, Yunnan, and ravaged the counties terribly. Although the civilians were fortunate not to be killed, the loss of rice, grain, livestock, and property totaled about 75,400 yuan in Daocheng and about 61,300 yuan in Xiangcheng. Derong, Yidun, Ba'an: Xiao He, Zhu Xu, and others joined forces. Luo's bandits captured Lihua again, and then a part of them took Morality and Rong from Zhongdian and roamed along the upper reaches of the Jinsha River. The loss of rice, grain, livestock, and property in Ba'an and Yidun totaled about 16,200 yuan in Derong, about 3,960 yuan in Yidun, and about 155,300 yuan in Ba'an. Although the three counties of Dege, Dengke, and Shiqu have been occupied for a long time, they have been harassed by guerrilla teams and have suffered heavy losses. The loss of rice, grain, livestock, and property totaled about 85,500 yuan in Dege, about 4,700 yuan in Dengke, and about 3,400 yuan in Shiqu (the largest local loss during the war between the Qing and Tibetan armies has not yet been reported). The above figures are based on the survey reports of the county governments. There are still some that have not been reported. In a poor area, it has suffered a major disaster. This number may not be large in the interior, but it is a shocking number in Xikang. In this way, it seems impossible to promote the implementation of the new policy. In addition, there is also a shocking news, that is, the Tibetan army on the west bank of the Jinsha River crossed eastward in September of the 25th year and occupied the four counties of Dengde and Baishi. At that time, the Qing army stationed in various counties was completely forced to retreat to Dengke. After several days and nights of fierce fighting, one Qing army battalion commander was killed in battle, and the casualties of lower-level officers and soldiers were heavy. People's hearts were shaken, and rumors were flying everywhere. In this environment of internal and external troubles, I had to go to Kangding to take responsibility. Before starting the journey, I thought several times and temporarily decided on three principles: to relieve the victims of the disaster, stabilize the people's hearts, and force the Tibetan army to retreat. When I was about to arrive in Liancheng, about 5,000 monks, laymen, and civilians in the Kang area gathered together. They greeted me for more than fifty miles. It must be said that the central government's attention to the people in the remote areas and their desire for governance all came from sincerity. Therefore, at the welcome ceremony at that time, I explained the significance of being sent to the west to the people in detail and explained the above three principles in detail. First, the people of Kang have suffered too much over the years, especially after being ravaged by the Red Bandits. We should try to relieve them. In addition to asking the central government for 80,000 yuan for emergency relief and sending personnel to distribute it, we also plan to formulate a general relief plan of 1 million yuan, which has also been submitted to the central government for approval and implementation. Second, regarding the various elements who followed Nuona and the Red Bandits in the past, I will never blame them for the past, in accordance with the central government's principle of being magnanimous, and give them a chance to reform. Third, regarding the Tibetan army's eastward invasion, in addition to directly telegraphing the Lhasa government to quickly withdraw its troops and using force to promote its realization, I also telegraphed the central government to strictly order its troops to withdraw from crossing the river. I immediately dispatched elite troops to threaten to advance from the north and south routes, and also asked the Qing army to increase its troops to garrison the Qing-Kang border to support each other. The security of the Kang border can be guaranteed to be safe. As for how to govern in the future, Xikang will only prove it in fact at any time in terms of negativity and positivity, based on the central government's intention and its own responsibility. As a result, the frightened and uneasy people in the Kang border gradually became tranquil. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association Held a Representative Assembly Yesterday</h3>
<p>Instructing the Shanghai Municipal Council to Genuinely Tighten Expenditures. Wu Yunzhai, Zhu Gengtao, and Zhou Bangjun Elected as Chinese Committee Members. The Remaining Nine Chinese Directors and Committee Members Were All Re-elected. The Number of Executive Committee Members Increased by Eight; Wang Xiaolai and Others Were Elected.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Taxpayers' Association held its first representative assembly of the current term yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Bank Club on 59 Hong Kong Road. The assembly elected Yu Qiaqing and four others as directors to attend the Shanghai Municipal Council, Lin Kanghou and six others as Chinese committee members, Jin Zongcheng as a land committee member, and Wang Xiaolai and thirty-five others as executive committee members. It also resolved to reject the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposed tax increase and instructed the council to genuinely reduce unnecessary expenditures within the year to achieve reasonableness, totaling ten proposals. Details of each matter are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Proceedings of the Meeting</p>
<p>Those present at the meeting yesterday included Geng Jiaji from the Municipal Government, Zhao Tiezhang from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, He Yuanming from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wu Jingxiong, advisor to the Shanghai Municipal Council, He DeKui, a council officer, and representatives Yu Qiaqing, Chen Qifen, Xu Jilun, and seventy-seven others. Wang Xiaolai chaired the meeting, with Yan Esheng and Tao Leqin as recorders. After formal ceremonies, Wang Xiaolai read the opening address. Jiang Yiping, representing the Chinese directors and committee members, reported on the progress of participating in government affairs at the Shanghai Municipal Council over the past year. Jin Zongcheng reported on attending the Shanghai Municipal Council Land Committee meeting. Subsequently, Chinese directors and committee members were elected. After representative Zhu Manyun and others proposed revising the association's constitution to increase the number of executive committee members from twenty-seven to thirty-five, the number of standing committee members from three to five, and the term of representatives from one year to two years, executive committee members were elected. The proposals were discussed until the meeting adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered the opening address, saying, "Distinguished representatives of the Party and government, esteemed representatives, since the establishment of this association to date, it has been nearly sixteen years. This representative assembly after the reorganization of this association is already the tenth session. The election of directors and committee members to attend the Shanghai Municipal Council is about to enter its tenth term. With common sense, the Shanghai Municipal Council, which relies on taxpayers' taxes for its maintenance, and the Shanghai Municipal Council, which relies on taxpayers' goodwill and support, should assist taxpayers and respect taxpayers to achieve optimal municipal administration and not fail the will of the taxpayers. Unexpectedly, individuality has taken effect, and selfishness has expanded to the extreme. Those responsible for the Shanghai Municipal Council actually regard the Shanghai Municipal Council as private property and regard the mandators as slaves. As the saying goes, "Receive people's money and help them eliminate disasters," but the facts show the opposite, which cannot be regarded as a major regret. Therefore, the responsibility of the representatives of this session is more important than that of the previous sessions. The responsibility of the directors and committee members who will be elected to attend the Shanghai Municipal Council in this session is also more important than that of the previous sessions. The words and opinions of the directors and committee members attending the Shanghai Municipal Council represent the words and opinions of the taxpayers. Otherwise, it is a failure to fulfill the obligations that the trustee should fulfill. If the words and opinions expressed are indeed the words and opinions that the mandators want to express, but are ignored, rejected, and despised by erroneous concepts, selfish prejudices, and arbitrary doctrines, then the mandators should strive to use all their spirit and ability to support the words and opinions of the trustee and seek to implement them. In other words, if the words and opinions of the directors and committee members attending the Shanghai Municipal Council are reasonable and justified, all of us representatives and all of us taxpayers should support and implement them, and do not let the directors and committee members of the Shanghai Municipal Council elected by this association become seat-warmers for the council and its committees. Distinguished representatives, perhaps you still remember the illegal tax increase by the Shanghai Municipal Council in 1927? Although the opposition of the taxpayers changed it to an extra donation, it was finally cancelled after one year. This shows the power of public opinion, which cannot be overcome by erroneous concepts, selfish prejudices, and arbitrary doctrines. This time, the persons responsible for the Shanghai Municipal Council, individuality and egoism, joined together. Under the leadership of Chairman Arnold, who has been advocating tax increases for many years, the council meeting was held. Based on the report of senior officials who regarded the Shanghai Municipal Council as private property and the threat of senior officials "walking out" of the Shanghai Municipal Council, regardless of the words and opinions expressed by the five Chinese directors representing more than 64% of the donation amount and more than 95% of the population, the proposal of the Japanese director to postpone the discussion for one week was not implemented. They reserved the right to vote in order to seek public opinion from the taxpayers, and the proposal to increase the municipal general tax from 14% to 16% and the land tax from 7/1000 to 8/1000 was submitted to the taxpayers' meeting with the approval of four British directors and two American directors. The draft amendment for the increase was first decided at the Finance Committee meeting on March 24, chaired by General Director Arnold. According to reports, the director of the Finance Department said that current rents have been reduced by 30% and revenue is insufficient, advocating for a tax increase. The chairman said that a rent of ten yuan would only increase by a few cents per month, seemingly thinking it was extremely cheap. Although the Chinese directors and committee members explained the pros and cons, they were ignored. The next day, a notice of the special council meeting to be held on the 24th was distributed to each director in the afternoon. Logically, increasing the burden on taxpayers is a major issue, and it should be considered at length. Therefore, the Japanese director proposed a one-week postponement to study the content and seek public opinion. The chairman put the postponement proposal to a vote, and both Chinese and Japanese directors supported it, totaling seven votes. The British and American directors opposed it, advocating immediate discussion, totaling six votes. According to the prevailing meeting rules, the proposal to postpone the discussion for one week would have passed. However, the meeting rules of the Shanghai Municipal Council are different. The quorum is nine people, and the chairman can cast a deciding vote when the votes are equal, in addition to casting an ordinary vote. Therefore, the chairman alone can cast two votes. This system, based on legal principles, is indeed not inappropriate, but it is very dangerous. If used properly, the happiness of those concerned can be preserved; if used improperly, the happiness of those concerned can be completely ruined. Therefore, those who refrain from using it are numerous. This time, the draft amendment for increasing taxes affects the happiness of taxpayers. If the chairman considers the interests of the mandators, follows the principle of increasing taxpayers' happiness and reducing taxpayers' pain, and exercises these two voting rights, he will naturally be understood by the public and recognized as a responsible person. However, this time, the exercise of the two voting rights was entirely dominated by erroneous concepts, in order to be intimidated by the aforementioned "walking out," and disregarding the interests of all taxpayers. Therefore, the responsibility for this draft amendment to increase taxes should be borne by General Director Arnold. The difficulty in matching income and expenditure and the inability to balance the budget of the Shanghai Municipal Council are not natural, but entirely artificial. On November 10, 1931, in view of the economic situation at the time, this association anticipated that the financial situation of the Shanghai Municipal Council would be dangerous if it did not economize early. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council proposing economy and tax reduction (the letter can be found in the Shanghai Zhongwai Daily newspaper the next day). The letter first explained the era of "living within one's means" versus "spending according to income" and the economic principle of "achieving the greatest effect with the least expense." It then described the economic recession and austerity measures in European and American countries, as well as Shanghai's economic position and the economic situation at the time, to show the necessity of economy. Therefore, the letter stated that "In the future, the financial policy of your council should focus on economy rather than merely seeking to increase revenue in order to maintain a balanced budget," and proposed two major principles of economy: "Adhere to economical administrative expenses" and "Suspend unnecessary undertakings." It also explained that the amount of expenses must be proportional to the efficiency of services, and used police expenses as an example, proposing four items that should be economized: (1) Abolish the music band; (2) Defense expenses and other expenses, use more Chinese people to reduce salaries and exchange subsidies, and save expenses; (3) Contract the expansion of public works; (4) Adjust staff salaries, so that the annual salary of patrolmen is below the subsistence level, while the salaries of senior officials exceed it by 140 times. The letter concluded, "The expenses of productive undertakings must be used, and the expenses of improving citizens' knowledge must be used, but in the end, practicality should be sought, not superficial beauty, and taxes that are sufficient to cause an increase in crime should be reduced or exempted as much as possible." Five years have passed since this letter, what is the response of those responsible for the Shanghai Municipal Council? According to the concrete facts: (1) The productive undertaking of the electricity department, a shared undertaking of taxpayers, was sold for 113.4 million yuan, which was fully collected at the end of 1933. Approximately 51.7 million yuan was used for debt repayment, approximately 14.8 million yuan was used for the debt price fund, and approximately 41.4 million yuan was used for special expenses such as real estate and houses. I don't know if these expenses such as real estate and houses can be as profitable as the electricity department, and the rest that is transferred to the temporary account of borrowing is only more than 5 million yuan. (2) The huge expansion of police expenses, judging from regular income, can be said to have a tendency to increase year by year. For example, in the first year it was 100%, and in the 18th year, although it was slightly less than the 17th year, it increased by 456% compared to the first year. In the 20th year and the 21st year, the former was slightly less than the previous year, but it increased by 541% compared to the first year, and the latter was slightly less than the previous year, but it had already increased compared to the previous year, increasing by 555% compared to the first year. In the 25th year, although it was slightly less than the previous year, it increased by 610% compared to the first year. May I ask if the average economic situation, its average income, its increase can have such a huge and stable percentage? Looking at the trend of increasing police expenses, only the 21st and 24th years were slightly less than the previous year, but compared to the first year, the former increased by 754% and the latter increased by 796%. Before the 17th year, the percentage of increase was still commensurate with the percentage of increase in regular income and both were low. In the 18th year, the year when Mr. Arnold took office as General Director, compared to the first year, the increase in regular income was 456%, while the increase in police expenses was 462%. In the following years, the percentage of increase in police expenses was higher than the percentage of increase in regular income, that is, 2.02% more in the 19th year, 2.56% more in the 20th year, 1.99% more in the 21st year, 2.12% more in the 22nd year, 1.77% more in the 23rd year, 1.71% more in the 24th year, and 2.04% more in the 25th year. However, is its efficiency not as stated in the aforementioned letter, "Defense expenses and crime increase simultaneously, greatly violating the economic principle?" Or is it as stated in the "Letter to the Citizens of the First Special District" issued by the Citizens' Union of the First Special District of Shanghai on March 27? (3) The music band and exchange subsidies continue to be maintained. The abolition of the music band has long been a unanimous public opinion. If it was implemented in the 18th year of the Republic of China, it would have saved approximately 2 million yuan by the 25th year. As for exchange subsidies, for example, when silver is expensive and gold is cheap, salaries are not reduced, which is considered a legitimate unexpected benefit. Then, when gold is expensive and silver is cheap, it should also be considered a legitimate unexpected loss. This is in line with the principle that rights and obligations are relative. Then, from the 19th year to the 25th year, 12 million yuan was saved. Even if we take a step back and say that the exchange rate has shrunk sharply and it is difficult for foreign employees to cope, a subsidy should be given to ensure their livelihood. However, it should also be temporary, at most for the duration of the contract, and should not exceed three years. Now, contracts are often cited as an excuse. May I ask who订this contract? In order to protect more than one hundred senior officials, self-made contracts that are detrimental to public economy are used as protective charms. May I ask if taxpayers have a legal and natural contract with the Shanghai Municipal Council? We believe that "liking what the residents like and disliking what the residents dislike" is the main condition of this contract. But what is it now? Why have the plans for balancing the budget that this association has proposed to the Shanghai Municipal Council in the past not been implemented? (4) Replacing Chinese people to save expenses was originally stated in the exchange of documents between this association and the Shanghai Municipal Council on March 26, 1928, and was also mentioned in the aforementioned letter. However, the fact is that for every Chinese secondary senior staff member established in each department, an equal number of foreign staff members are added to counteract it. Isn't this an act of "building a bed on a bed?" I don't know what the intention is. Is it only to fear that the budget will not be balanced and to make it happen? Due to the above-mentioned facts, the budget for the 26th year will naturally be difficult to balance. However, balancing is also easy. It is only necessary to abolish the exchange subsidy of 1.67 million yuan this year on the grounds that the exchange rate has already stabilized, and to abolish the music band on the grounds that it is only for the enjoyment of very few artists. After offsetting the so-called shortage of 1.25 million yuan, there is still a surplus. According to the facts, from the 15th year to the 25th year, a period of 11 years, the regular income and expenditure have been increasing year by year. Comparing the two, the former increased by 167% and the latter increased by 187%. In the four years from the 15th year to the 18th year, compared to income and expenditure, the former was faster and the latter was slower. In recent years, except for 1936, the increase in income and expenditure has been commensurate. The reason for creating the trend of "spending more than income" is actually due to the rapid increase in expenditure in the 19th and 20th years. Furthermore, the increase in the total donation income has the fastest trend, but it only decreased by more than 700,000 yuan in the 25th year, but this is only a phenomenon in the first half of the year. The trend of recovery has already appeared in the second half of the year. Therefore, based on the above-mentioned facts, the reason why the budget of the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot be balanced is due to waste and to those who regard the Shanghai Municipal Council as private property, and is not caused by the external environment. Then, is the Shanghai Municipal Council's benefit to taxpayers similar to what the Bible calls a "leaky bag?" Yes, there are also facts that can be used to answer. For example, for peddlers seeking small profits, they must be destroyed to prevent them from being peddlers and engaging in businesses prohibited by criminal law. For shops, hotels, etc., they are often encouraged to develop their business, or add license fees, or estimate high rents, increase patrolman donations, or limit their rents, or limit their scope. For those who build lofts and live in thatched sheds, they are demolished if they are profitable or if they have no tax burden, even disregarding property rights protected by law. As for education subsidies, which are a provision that municipal agencies should have and were set up by former General Director Pei Er and praised by taxpayers, the current officials use various methods to formulate rules and apply them retroactively, using fire prevention and hygiene as an excuse to create the fact of stopping the entire or part of the subsidy. Their intention is that they are unwilling to take from the residents and use it for the residents. The eight-year education plan was also promoted by former General Director Pei Er. Since Mr. Arnold took office as General Director last year, no new schools have been added. If it is mentioned, it is often said that it is limited by the budget, or it is shielded by tax increases. However, experts are hired to investigate public utilities and for certain reports, costing 200,000 or 100,000 yuan without hesitation. Are these numbers not included in the budget? Senior officials who retire or are satirized to retire are given pensions and dismissal money, also costing 200,000 or 100,000 yuan without hesitation. Are these numbers already included in the budget? "In the name of improving the lives of rickshaw pullers, the Rickshaw Committee was established at an annual cost of 50,000 yuan. Disputes arise one after another, and the result is a reduction in the number of rickshaws, making rickshaw pullers have fewer rickshaws to pull, and achieving the goal of increasing the profits of buses threefold. The lives of rickshaw pullers remain the same, with little improvement. Although this expense does not come from the Shanghai Municipal Council, but from the registration fees of rickshaw pullers, rickshaw pullers have added a burden. Isn't it taking the small profits of others as great profits, and forgetting their own great profits, thinking it is no profit? The facilities of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the reports of the directors and committee members in the last year have been detailed. What I can say is: (1) The Bank of Communications on Nanjing Road was robbed in broad daylight, and the case has not yet been solved, making public security a serious problem. (2) Blocking the traffic on roads outside the boundary in areas under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Police Department infringes on our country's sovereignty. (3) Demolishing thatched sheds and lofts infringes on property rights. (4) Limiting the number of vehicles and preventing cars from parking in front of shops hinders business. (5) Finally, the draft amendment to increase the total donation land tax, which is an increase of 14.29% compared to the current rate, approximately one and a half percent, was passed, ignoring the opinions and opinions of the Chinese directors representing more than 64% of the donation amount and more than 95% of the population, and exercising the extremely dangerous power of the chairman's two votes. This is contempt for public opinion. Distinguished representatives, the Chinese directors and committee members who are about to retire, whether their opposition to the establishment of the draft amendment to increase donations in the Shanghai Municipal Council represents the public opinion of Chinese taxpayers should be considered by us. We are elected by Chinese taxpayers, and the lives and property of Chinese taxpayers are directly entrusted to us to seek safety. If taxpayers oppose the increase in donations, we should also oppose it. If taxpayers support the increase in donations, we should also support it. Weighing the situation and considering the reasons, we only hope that the facts are beneficial to the public. On behalf of the Chinese taxpayers, I would like to thank the Chinese directors and committee members for serving the public, and thank the Party and government representatives for their presence and supervision.</p>
<p>Report of Directors and Committee Members</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, were mistakenly elected by the previous representative assembly as directors of the board of directors and members of various committees of the Shanghai Municipal Council in 1936. Now, after one year, our term has expired. We respectfully report the major policies that we participated in during our tenure, especially those that are closely related to us Chinese: (1) Distribution of duties in the Administrative Committee. In the administrative system of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the position of each committee member is crucial, acting as a link between the top and bottom. Previous reports have described this in detail. In the council's general administration, except for very minor administrative routine matters, or very major matters such as extraordinary incidents, all matters that are submitted to the board of directors for resolution in due course are first submitted to the relevant committee for discussion, and a method of handling them is assumed. The committee system has obvious benefits, making the affairs of the board of directors simpler, allowing them to focus on dealing with major issues, and achieving the clear effect of division of labor and cooperation. Committee meetings do not need to be confined to formalities, and each committee member can fully express their opinions, question each other, and the opinions of each administrative director can be revised and supplemented, and the administrative directors can also revise and supplement the opinions of each committee member. The dignity of the board of directors meetings is maintained, and opinions are more likely to be communicated. With the committee organization, all those in the community who are enthusiastic about public welfare and have excellent knowledge can be invited to serve as committee members, extensively consult, and be more inclusive, without limiting them to elected directors to participate in the administration of the concession. Moreover, each committee member can also learn about municipal administration and prepare for serving as a director in the future. The number of committees this year is roughly the same as in the previous session, but police and traffic have been combined due to their similar nature, and the number of Chinese committee members has increased to four. Other committees have been consistent over the years, with no major changes. Those established due to special issues include the Housing Committee, which is dedicated to discussing and improving the housing situation in the concession. The Chinese committee members include Mr. Guo Bolang and others. A report has been drafted and is awaiting implementation. The Chinese members of the major committees are listed as follows: Finance Committee, ten seats, three Chinese seats, held by Xu Xinliu, Xi Yushu, and Chen Jicheng; Police Committee, nine seats, four Chinese seats, held by Yu Qiaqing, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Xu Xiaochu; Public Works Committee, eight seats, three Chinese seats, held by Guo Shun, Zhou Yueran, and Zhu Wenqi; Staff Committee, eight seats, three Chinese seats, held by Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, and Xi Yushu; Public Utilities Committee, eight seats, three Chinese seats, held by Feng Bingnan, Jiang Yiping, and Yu Hualong; Education Committee, nine seats, four Chinese seats, held by Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhanen, Ou Yuanhuai, and Xi Yushu; Library Committee, eight seats, three Chinese seats, held by Xu Xinliu, Chen Jicheng, and Zhu Wenqi; (2) Negotiations on factory inspection. Factory inspection is extremely important for the welfare and safety of citizens and workers in the concession. Over the years, the Municipal Government and the Council have consulted frequently, not avoiding difficulties, and have drafted an agreement that all factory laws promulgated by the central government and applicable to the scope of the Municipal Government's jurisdiction will be implemented uniformly in the concession with the consent of the Council. According to the agreement, an inspection office will be set up in the Council, with an equal number of inspectors dispatched by the Municipal Government and the Council to exercise their powers in accordance with the factory inspection law promulgated by the National Government. The full text of the agreement is extremely important and is hereby announced as follows: 1. The Shanghai Municipal Council, entrusted by the Chinese authorities, shall implement the factory law and its implementing regulations, as well as other related regulations, in the public concession after they have been implemented in the Chinese community and agreed upon by both parties through negotiations. 2. A factory inspection office shall be set up in the Municipal Council, with half of the inspectors dispatched by the Chinese authorities and half by the Municipal Council. 3. Inspectors shall have the following qualifications: (A) proficient in Chinese and English; (B) familiar with Chinese factory law; (C) have knowledge or experience in any of the following: industrial chemistry, architecture, sanitation engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, statistics, or other experience applicable to factory inspection. 4. All inspectors shall be subject to a six-month probationary period before being formally employed. 5. Inspectors' salaries shall be determined according to their qualifications and experience. 6. The inspection office shall perform its duties in accordance with the Chinese factory inspection law. 7. In case of violations, lawsuits shall be filed in court when the Chinese factory law is to be enforced. 8. The Municipal Council agrees to provide the Chinese government with reports in a manner that can be implemented after further consultation. 9. This agreement shall be valid for three years, and either party may notify the other party six months in advance to terminate it upon expiration. The above agreement must be approved by the consular corps. After the agreement was initially signed by both parties, the Council requested the consular corps for approval in June. It then received a reply from the consular corps, stating that according to the agreement, Chinese law would apply to all factories in the concession, regardless of nationality. If implemented, the rights of those who generally enjoy consular jurisdiction would be削stripped, which the Municipal Council was not authorized to recognize. Therefore, the Council consulted with the Municipal Government to revise it, adding a clear provision stating that the implementation of the factory law would be limited to factories in the concession under Chinese jurisdiction. The consular corps also stated that it did not object to adding another article to the agreement, stating that the Municipal Council, with the permission of the authorities, may carry out the same inspection procedures in other factories in accordance with the powers conferred by the land regulations. Factory inspection, after years of negotiations, the Municipal Government and the Council worked together in the spirit and painstakingly established an agreement, but it was changed again due to the consular corps' misunderstanding. This is frustrating and regrettable. Fortunately, our Municipal Government considered the overall situation and expressed its willingness to continue negotiations, and has prepared another draft for the basis of negotiations. It is hoped that it will be completed soon. (3) Revision of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations. Revision of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations and appendices is one of the major policies of the Council this year. Although the regulations have not been expressly recognized by our government, the Council has always regarded them as the highest law in the concession, on which its ruling power is based. Whether this fragmented and outdated document should continue to be the constitution of the special zone's administration depends on the efforts of our government. For the sake of the text, the last revision was ten years ago. Since then, the organization of the Council has undergone many changes, the most notable being the addition of three Chinese directors in 1928, the addition of two more in 1930, and the addition of two Chinese land committee members in 1933. Although the procedures for adding them were carried out in accordance with the prescribed procedures, after consultation with the local authorities and the consular corps, they were submitted to the diplomatic corps and our country's highest government for approval, the Land Regulations have not yet expressly stipulated. The Council decided to revise them to conform to the actual situation. The draft revision was prepared in August and approved by the consular corps, and was immediately printed. According to the relevant revised articles, there are three articles: Article 6, A, adds two Chinese land committee members, specifically noting "elected by the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, one elected by the Real Estate Association." Articles 10 and 18, adds five Chinese members, noting that they are elected by the Chinese Taxpayers' Association. The revisions are annotated, stating that the addition of Chinese directors and land committee members is based on the procedures stipulated in Article 28 of these regulations, approved by the Chinese and foreign authorities, etc. (4) Implementation of the austerity plan. In recent years, the global economic downturn has affected all industries in the city, and the Council's tax revenue has decreased year by year, resulting in discussions of austerity. A Fire Service Expense Committee was first formed to discuss austerity, and it was agreed to reduce the number of fire stations, watchtowers, fire engines, etc., and to dismiss Chinese and foreign team members, which is estimated to save 200,000 yuan per year. This has been gradually implemented. In October, the Field Artillery Team and Light Artillery Team of the International Volunteer Corps were disbanded. In the same month, it was resolved to abolish the Rickshaw Committee and the Intelligence Office, with rickshaw affairs归returning to the Police Department and intelligence affairs归returning to the General Office for handling, which can save 100,000 yuan per year. The budget expenses of other departments such as public works and sanitation have also been reduced. Among the various austerity plans, the recommendations of the Staff Savings Committee are the most important. The Council's staff待遇treatment has always been very good. This was done to encourage civil servants to be diligent and devoted to their duties when all industries were prosperous, which can be said to be reasonable. If in the autumn of economic downturn and the shortage of the city treasury, we do not seek ways to reduce expenses, it is obviously not a fair way of governing. According to the committee's recommendations, it can save approximately 1.06 million yuan per year. However, some of them are somewhat harsh on lower-level staff. We have discussed each item in detail and proposed revisions, and the revised report has also been published. Overall, it still seems that we have not been able to focus on the big picture. This is limited by the environment, and a thorough solution awaits the future. (5) The situation of opium prohibition in the concession. The situation of opium prohibition in the concession this year is not much different from last year. The International League of Nations Opium Committee held a meeting in May and expressed its satisfaction with the Council's handling of the smoking, selling, and manufacturing of narcotics, and stated that the Chinese representative should declare that the Chinese government was very satisfied with the efforts of the concession authorities to cooperate in opium prohibition. The number of opium smokers in the concession this year is about the same as last year, and the number seems to have increased at the end of the year. The police have seized more than 5,400 drug offenders throughout the year, including two American citizens, four Japanese citizens, seventeen Korean citizens, and ten Russian citizens. Eight private factories manufacturing heroin and morphine and eighteen private factories manufacturing red pills have been closed. The total amount of fines imposed is more than 127,000 yuan. Smoking, manufacturing, and selling opium are prohibited in the concession, and more than 2,000 people have been detained for smoking opium and opening opium dens. The seized raw opium is more than 1,800 taels, and several thousand taels of cooked opium have been sent to the court for incineration. (6) Chinese education facilities. This year's Chinese education facilities have not progressed as much as we had hoped due to the Council's financial difficulties, which is a great regret. According to the eight-year plan, two primary schools should have been set up this year, but only one has been added, which was established at the beginning of the year. The address is located at the old site of the Hansbury School on Peng Road. Enrollment is limited to poor children, with a two-level system, one level in the morning and one in the afternoon, graduating in four years. The level is roughly the same as the primary school established by the Ministry. There are currently 1,200 students enrolled, which is convenient for those who enroll. In addition, two night schools have been added. The school buildings and equipment of the Council's schools are very perfect, but they are closed after the usual classes are completed, which makes people sigh that they have not been used to their full potential. Therefore, we advocated using the校舍school舍to run night schools, which is inexpensive and benefits workers in the concession. One is at the Huishan Road Primary School and the other is at the North District Primary School. The number of students enrolled is very enthusiastic. Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Council has a total of five schools for Western children, five schools for Chinese children, six primary schools, and three night schools. The number of students, excluding night schools, is approximately 8,800. As for the subsidies, the total amount for Chinese schools this year is more than 227,700 yuan, with 223 schools receiving subsidies, and more than 46,000 students. There may be some excessive harassment in hygiene and fire prevention inspections, which has been raised by Chinese education committee members at meetings from time to time to request correction. In addition, this year's summer Chinese children's public school graduates held a joint examination, and those who passed were given certificates. At the same time, 85 people participated in the social bureau's joint examination, and 69 people passed all subjects. All graduates of the Shanghai Municipal Council Public School are recognized by our government and receive the same待遇treatment as graduates of our country's public and private schools. This is also one aspect of the progress of Chinese education in recent years. (7) The two-cent tax increase and the process. The proposal for a two-cent tax increase has been circulating for a long time, but it has been suspended from time to time due to the depression of all industries and economic downturn in recent years. When the budget was prepared this year, it was estimated that there would be a deficit of 3 million yuan, so the proposal for a tax increase was reiterated. We believe that in the way of financial management, it is important to increase revenue, but it is more important to reduce expenditure. Although the Council has also carried out austerity in various expenditures, in our Chinese perspective, there are still places where expenditures can be reduced. Moreover, in recent years, the maritime industry has been hit hard by the tide of the global economic panic and has not easily recovered. As a local authority, we should be pacifying and nurturing it, and how can we impose taxes again, making the lives of our people more difficult? Therefore, we strongly opposed it in the议席seat, but in the end, the number of Chinese and foreign representatives was unbalanced, so it failed. According to the final decision on the tax increase, the power lies with the taxpayers. The Council's decision does not have the final binding force. The power of the taxpayers is now with the Western Taxpayers' Association, and it is difficult to predict what decision will be made. The only pity is that this association has not been able to争obtain the same position as the Western Taxpayers' Association. As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Council's budget, etc., does not need to be submitted to this association for approval, and can take effect after being passed by the Western Taxpayers' Association. This畸形deformed organization must be corrected in the end. Two years ago, we提出raised磋商consultation with General Director Arnold, but this matter is of great importance and cannot be achieved in one fell swoop. Given time, it will naturally be successful. However, it still depends on the joint efforts of our representatives to move forward and bear the burden together. The above sections may be known to you, or may not be known to you. In summary, it is a major policy implemented in the concession in the past year, which can be asserted. We are incompetent, and we have mistakenly undertaken the election of the previous representative assembly. We have reluctantly shouldered the great difficulties, facing the conflicts of Chinese and foreign negotiations, and considering the煩煩繁complicated political affairs of the local government. We are always worried that the well is too deep and the rope is too short. It is difficult to live up to the earnest expectations of the citizens and the urgent supervision of you all, and we feel very guilty. However, our private love for the country is the same as that of the sages, and our desire to recover our rights has not dared to lag behind others. Everything related to local welfare and national sovereignty has been pursued with exhaustion and diligence. This is roughly enough to comfort you. As for other political affairs in the concession, which are sent by this association every week, each taxpayer of the Shanghai Municipal Council will receive a Chinese public gazette, which are all listed in detail. I want to receive the telegram鉴, and the annual report of 1936 will also be finalized soon, with more detailed discussions. The secretariat of this association will be elected within a few days, and you can request to read it at any time. What is not covered in this report is detailed in it.</p>

<h3>The Jiaoji Railway Boshan Branch Line is About to Be Completed</h3>
<p>The Entire Line Has Been Extended; Railway Transportation Should Increase</p>
<p>Jinan Telegraph: Since its takeover, the Jiaoji Railway's income has been increasing daily. Last year, it broke previous records, reaching over 17 million yuan. Now, after the railway bought the Boshan Light Railway, it has changed the route and is modifying it into a formal branch line. In the future, Boshan coal transportation will be more convenient, and income will surely increase further. Tan Shuku, the railway's traffic director, recently went to Boshan to inspect the road construction project and arrived in Jinan on the 10th. According to him, regarding the current state of the project and its benefits after completion, the Boshan extension line project is currently being actively carried out. The roadbed construction will soon be completed, and track laying will begin shortly. In about two months, construction trains can operate. The project can be completed in four months, with official traffic opening in August. Previously, the light railway route originally passed through the west of Boshan city. Now, this route will be changed to pass through the east of the city, extending to Badouzhuang and curving to Qiugou. However, this area is dominated by mountains, making construction difficult, with rock excavation reaching depths of seven meters. But Qiugou is rich in coal production, and setting up a station here could increase revenue by about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan annually. The extension line is 14 kilometers long, and together with the sidings, it is about 20 kilometers. It is planned to establish seven stations, and the locations have already been surveyed. In the future, when this line is completed, Boshan miners and merchants will have much greater convenience. The railway's income can increase by 800,000 to 900,000 yuan annually. The railway's income has been best in the last two years. Currently, it is over 50,000 yuan per day, with the highest reaching 30,000 yuan recently. Now that the coal backlog in Boshan has been cleared, there is no more accumulation. Judging from the current situation, and with the railway's newly purchased vehicles arriving next spring, future income could reach 20 million yuan annually. Furthermore, the Luokou Chamber of Commerce has written to the railway stating that the transport of soybeans from the upper reaches of the Yellow River to the Jiaoji Railway line is very active. Luokou currently has over 8,000 tons in storage, with more arriving continuously. There is no space for storage, and transporting it to Jinan by manpower for loading onto trains is slow and costly. They request that the railway load the soybeans and transport them eastward to Huangtai Station via the Luokou-Huanglian joint transport line. The railway has allocated vehicles; 20 vehicles will be sufficient for every 40 tons of soybeans. The railway's daily income can increase by 5,000 yuan. The income from one train is equivalent to half of the entire day's passenger transport."</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Another Weakening of the People's Party</h3>
<p>The late Mr. Dan, former incumbent of the Central Party History Compilation case, emulated Mr. Lu in following the Premier's revolution, joining the Tongmenghui as a member early on. In the autumn of Xinhai, he gathered comrades to restore Wuxi and subsequently served as secretary to the provisional president in Nanjing, assisting with military operations to restore the Han dynasty, for which his merits were particularly great. In the sixteenth year of the Republic, he launched an uprising in Wuxi, driving out warlords and suppressing communists, bringing peace to the region, which was praised by the locals. He recently passed away due to pneumonia. There was widespread mourning. Yesterday was the encoffining ceremony, and those who came to pay their respects were endless. Central Committee members Zhang Ji, Shao Lizi, Liu Yazi, Mao Zuquan, and others all sent telegrams of condolence.</p>
<p>Commissioner Turnover</p>
<p>Zang Qifang, the district administrative inspector and district security commander, has been promoted to president of Northeastern University and has submitted his resignation to the provincial government, which has been approved. Shi Kuiling, the commissioner of the Sixth District, has been transferred to fill the vacancy. After receiving orders, Mr. Shi immediately proceeded to handle the handover. On the 10th, he took his staff to Yancheng on a special steamer to meet with Chairman Chen, Director Yu, and Director Xiang Zhizhuang of the Security Office in the province, and to discuss everything with former commissioner Zang Qifang. It was decided that he would take office in Wuxi on the 16th. His staff has been internally decided: Secretary Du Zhiting, Staff Officer Yang Yutong, and Section Chief Long Xinqi. Commissioner Zang also returned to Wuxi from the province yesterday to handle the handover procedures. At six o'clock in the evening, the Party Headquarters, the County Government, the Court, and various public groups held a farewell banquet for Mr. Zang at the County Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Two Robbers Apprehended in the Fei Robbery Case</h3>
<p>In Wu County, robberies frequently occurred in the bustling urban areas near the city. Officials ordered the serious crime section chief of the Cheng District Police Station, Si Daodang, and the squad leader, Chen Chayi, to investigate. After discovering that the robbers in the Fei Jin family robbery case in Qilian Village were hiding in the home of their nephew, Yi Shu, in the Cheng Liao Township of the Fourth District, on the 10th, they sent police officers to arrest the robber, Wang Shengdu, at that address. During questioning at Xutang Town, he confessed to conspiring with six others to rob the Fei family. He also revealed that his accomplice, Huang Yinxian, lived in Ditiantou Village. The detectives then went to capture him and took him into temporary custody. On the 11th, they sent additional officers to the countryside to seize evidence for submission and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Elderly Man and Young Woman Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>In the Ganlu Temple area of the Yangtze River in this county, on the afternoon of the 10th, an elderly man, drunk and in pain, jumped into the river to commit suicide. The red boat of the Jiaoshan Lifesaving Boat Bureau saw this and immediately sailed to rescue him. He was quickly pulled from the river. When asked about the reason for his suicide, he stated that his name was Zhou Wencai, he was 68 years old, and he lived at No. 10 Majia Lane in the city. Due to poverty at home, he had developed a desire to end his life. He was later taken back by his family. At four o'clock in the afternoon, a woman, about thirty years old, also jumped into the river to commit suicide near the Hexing Wharf. The bureau's red boat heard the alarm and immediately carried out the rescue, pulling her onto the boat. When asked about her name and the reason for her suicide, she refused to reveal any information, only saying that she lived on Yantou Street and ran a frame and painting shop. The bureau reported this to the Fourth Police Station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Chongming: Investing in the Development of Shengsi Island</h3>
<p>The Shengsi Islands in the Fifth District, outside of Chongming County, have seen increasing stability in local security since the authorities began to diligently manage them. Recently, there are plans to lease the Ao Jiang ironclad steamship to travel to Shanghai, which will further facilitate transportation. According to sources, Shen Houzai, the chairman of the county chamber of commerce, recently invited prominent figures from the business and commerce sectors to discuss investing in the development of the island. It has been decided to first conduct small-scale trials. They are currently in contact with the district chief of the island to develop plans.

<h3>Crew of the Haiheng, Amoy-Philippines Liner, Request Pay Raise</h3>
<p>If the Bureau Does Not Grant the Request, the Haiheng Will Cease Operations; Currently Being Discussed and Resolved</p>
<p>The Haiheng, the Amoy-Philippines liner of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, arrived in Little Luzon on its first voyage. Upon returning to Amoy, the entire crew sent a telegram to Cai Zengji, the general manager, requesting a pay raise. Their reasoning was that since the Haiheng now sails internationally, it should follow the Ministry of Communications' regulations for crew service, which stipulate that the treatment of crew on international voyages should be significantly higher than that of crew on domestic voyages. The captain's salary is set at 600 to 1,000 yuan, the first mate's at 300 to 500 yuan, the second mate's at 200 to 400 yuan, the third mate's starting at 190 yuan, and the chief engineer's at 450 to 800 yuan. The salaries of the first and second assistant engineers should also be upgraded accordingly. However, the Haiheng's crew is still receiving the salaries of domestic liner crew, which does not comply with the regulations. They requested a pay raise for the entire crew and demanded a prompt response; otherwise, the Haiheng would cease operations in Little Luzon. Fortunately, Zeng Guangqing, who had been sent by the bureau to inspect shipping operations in the Philippines, was on board and heard the news. Greatly alarmed by the possibility of a work stoppage, which would not only affect shipping operations but also damage the nation's reputation, Zeng immediately consulted with Captain Ma Jiajun to earnestly persuade the entire crew. They verbally promised the crew that their pay would be raised to the international rates. If they did not trust them, Zeng and Ma would personally advance two months' salary, totaling 1,900 yuan, as a guarantee for the Haiheng's entire crew's pay raise for April. They urged everyone to continue working and sailing as usual and telegraphed Cai Zengji, requesting a prompt solution. Yesterday, the bureau seriously discussed this critical issue and forwarded the matter to the Ministry for instructions. They also telegraphed Zeng and Ma, instructing them to appease the crew and continue sailing as usual, pending a resolution.</p>

<h3>Muslim Pilgrimage Delegation Led by Ma Lin Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recounting the Pilgrimage</p>
<p>Ma Lin, the chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Government, along with his son Bu Yuan and religious teachers Ma Zhengqing and Ma Li, led a delegation of 136 Muslims from the Northwest provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, organized as the Chinese Muslim Pilgrimage Delegation, to Mecca in the Holy Land for pilgrimage for over five months. Mr. Ma and his delegation arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m. aboard the P&amp;O liner Panrhos. Wu Jianchang, representing the president of the Control Yuan, Yu Zai, Tan Kemin, the secretary-general of the Qinghai Provincial Government, Wang Zhinan, representing the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Mu Shaofeng, Wu Zizhou, and Zhao Pei of the Qinghai Provincial Government, and over 500 students from various Muslim organizations and primary schools in the city went to the dock to welcome the delegation. The delegation left the country on October 27 of last year, via Hong Kong to Singapore, changing ships via Penang and Colombo to Aden. They landed at the dock and changed to camels, traveling over 2,000 miles across the desert. On December 2, they arrived in Mecca in the country of Hejaz and were warmly received by the King of Hejaz. They then toured Hadhramaut, Yemen, Oman, Najd, Medina, and other major regions. On February 18 of this year, they went to Arafat, a Muslim holy site, for the pilgrimage to the Kaaba. There were over 200,000 participating pilgrims, 150,000 of whom came from countries around the world. The tents stretched for hundreds of miles, truly a grand sight. The pilgrimage lasted for three days, ending on the 20th. They returned to Mecca and departed on March 14, returning to the country via the original route, taking a total of five and a half months. According to the pilgrims, Hejaz is a Muslim country with a population of about 100,000. Due to its location in the desert, it has no production other than animal husbandry, so all kinds of goods come from abroad. There are only a dozen or so Chinese in Mecca, all of whom are Muslims. According to Tan Kemin, the secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Government, Chairman Ma will rest briefly in Shanghai and then return to Qinghai to resume his duties.</p>

<h3>Conflict Occurs During Petition by Workers of Meiya Ten Factories Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Workers from Various Factories Petitioned Separately for Relief; Municipal Government Handling Union Appeals According to Law</p>
<p>After silk factory workers demanded improved treatment, and the Social Affairs Bureau adjudicated a solution, the employers refused to comply and appealed to the Municipal Government. The workers petitioned for the fulfillment of the conditions. A conflict with the police occurred during the petition by the workers of Meiya Ten Factories yesterday. The Municipal Government has swiftly handled the matter according to law. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Conflict During the Petition by Meiya Ten Factories</p>
<p>The approximately 500 workers of Meiya Tenth Factory in Bazihongqiao, Zhabei, went on strike again on the evening of the previous day after the factory failed to implement the solution adjudicated by the Social Affairs Bureau and arbitrarily oppressed the workers. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, they gathered in front of the factory and marched towards the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Upon receiving the report, the Police Headquarters immediately dispatched two police vehicles and a large number of police officers. When the workers reached the Shuizha Road Bridge, they clashed with the police. Two workers were injured, and six were arrested. Lu Yinchu from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Zhu Guilin from the Social Affairs Bureau went to persuade the workers. It was not until 12:00 noon that the workers elected six representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. They were received by Wang Xianqing, the director of the Mediation Division, who promised to investigate and verify the matter. The workers returned to the factory at around 1:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Increase in Silk Workers' Strikes</p>
<p>⑴ After the workers of Meiya Jingwei and the main factory went on strike again, they sent three worker representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to petition, demanding that the employers be ordered to comply with the conditions. They were received by Wang Xianqing, the director of the Third Division's Mediation Division, who promised to request instructions from the director for verification. ⑵ Workers at the Huacheng Silk Factory on Xietu Road in the Nanshi district have gone on strike in protest of the employers' dismissal of workers. ⑶ The Tianyi Silk Factory on Pingliang Road in the Hudong district has announced a shutdown.

<h3>The Mongolia-Chahar-Suiyuan Painting Exhibition Officially Opens Today</h3>
<p>Preview and Reception for All Sectors Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The Mongolia-Chahar-Suiyuan Painting Exhibition by Shen Yiqian has been arranged and prepared. Yesterday (the 12th) at 3:00 p.m., a preview and reception for all sectors were held on the fourth floor of the Great New Company. The enthusiastic atmosphere is difficult to describe. The reporter will briefly describe the situation yesterday:</p>
<p>Exhibition Hall Setup The exhibition hall is located in the East Hall on the fourth floor of the Great New Company on Nanjing Road. The elevator goes directly to the entrance, which is very convenient for visitors. Upon entering the hall, the Mongolia-Chahar-Suiyuan sketches immediately come into view. The second section contains ink paintings with concise explanations. The reporter went around for a week, as if personally visiting the frontier. The third and fourth sections are all watercolor paintings, with vigorous brushstrokes and no vulgarity. Around the perimeter are over a hundred photographs and various specimens, including murals from lama temples, which are special products of Inner Mongolia and are extremely valuable.</p>
<p>General Works The works are divided into three types: ⑴ sketches, ⑵ photographs, and ⑶ specimens. The photographs and specimens are all rare works, especially valuable for reference at this time of crisis on the frontier. Watercolor paintings account for about one-third of the total, and their larger size easily attracts attention. Among them are "Juyong Pass," "Wild Horse Herd on Xingligang Cliff," "Panoramic View of Yanmen Pass," "Knight Going to the Enemy," "Living After a Wolf Attack," "Hero Mourning White Hair," "Eternal Wanderer," "Food Cart in Pingdi Spring," "Life of Nomadic People," "Fox and Raccoon in the Deep Mountains of Jehol," "Descendants of Genghis Khan," etc. These works not only reach the pinnacle of technique but also contain national defense awareness.</p>
<p>Tea Party At 3:00 p.m., the meeting was announced. After the host Shen Yiqian delivered a speech, Qian Huafo, Xu Xinqin, Xu Xiaotian, and Zhu Yingpeng spoke successively. The first to speak was the socialite Dr. Huang Jingwan, who said that ⑴ Mr. Shen's works are full of national consciousness, ⑵ explaining that the painter must have a great life for the works to be great, and ⑶ hoping that the painter will take the bright path. The event ended happily at around 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Official Opening It is said that the event will officially open today (the 13th). As Mr. Zhu Yingpeng said, "The Mongolia-Chahar-Suiyuan Painting Exhibition is a painting exhibition with national defense significance, not a painting exhibition of romantic subjects. Therefore, it will definitely gain the support of the majority." This is predictable. The city has a population of approximately 3.7 million. In order to maintain order, the association has decided to charge an admission fee of one dime. As for group visits, there will be preferential treatment.</p>
<h3>Li Xiaxuan Impersonates Liao Yi to Defraud the Ministry of Military Affairs</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau is Ordered to Arrest, Detaining Li Xiaxuan and Two Others</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau yesterday received Official Letter No. 892 from the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, which roughly stated: "The Ministry has successively received several letters from Liao Ziyu of No. 77, Linyin Branch Lane, Nanshi, Shanghai, and No. 2, Listening Sound Lane, Linyin Road, Nanshi, using the name Liao Yi to defraud the Vice Minister of funds. Such behavior is illegal. We hereby request that you investigate and arrest the person at the above locations and punish them appropriately." After receiving the letter, Director Cai secretly ordered Captain Liu of the Detective Brigade to instruct Liu Guangjun, the squad leader in charge of the jurisdiction of the Ximen Branch Bureau and five detachments, to lead detectives to arrest Li Xiaxuan, a native of Sichuan, 30 years old, who was impersonating and swindling at No. 77, Linyin Branch Lane, yesterday morning, along with his companion Xin Farong, 31 years old, a native of Yangzhou. Four forged stone seal engravings of Liao Ziyu and others were found on Li, as well as a reply letter from Deng Xihou, the commander of the 45th Army of the Sichuan Army. The letter was Deng's reply to Liao, stating that he had already sent 200 yuan and was awaiting a reply. However, the letter only arrived yesterday, and the remittance was still in transit. It was found that Li Xiaxuan had served as a secretary in the 45th Army of the Sichuan Army in his hometown of Sichuan. After leaving his post, he became destitute in Shanghai and fell into poverty. Therefore, he impersonated Liao Yi (i.e., Liao Ziyu) to defraud funds for living expenses. After interrogation, the case was related to the order to arrest the impersonator for fraud, and a document was prepared and sent to the General Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>Tan Derong Commits Suicide by Jumping from a Building</h3>

<p>Tan Derong, 21 years old this year, the younger brother of Tan Shituan, a Cantonese translator currently working at the Chengdu Road Police Station, residing at No. 19, Shanhai Lane, Shanhai Pass Road, Public Concession, is unemployed and unmarried.

On the 11th, he left home during the day and suddenly went to the upper floor of a company building at No. 525, Route Petain, French Concession, at 8:30 that evening and jumped out of the window, falling onto the road and committing suicide. At that time, the area was quiet and there were few pedestrians. Chinese Detective No. 111, who was patrolling the area for the police station, heard the sound and rushed to investigate, only to find that Tan had committed suicide by jumping from the building, his brains splattered and blood flowing all over the ground. He died shortly after. He reported to the Route Petain Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate. No one in the house at No. 525 Route Petain knew him or knew when he went upstairs. Later, a note was found on the deceased, and after repeated investigations, his family was found and the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall Autopsy Institute. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court was requested to come to the institute to examine the body and confirmed that the deceased, Tan Derong, died from falling. The body was handed over to his brother, Tan Shikai, to claim it for burial.</p>

<h3>Minsheng Company's Minzhu Steamer Runs Aground</h3>
<p>Passengers are Fortunately Safe, but Goods are Damaged</p>
<p>The Minzhu steamer of Minsheng Industrial Company has always operated between Yichang and Chongqing.

The shipowner sent a telegram for help. After receiving the telegram, the company's Minxuan steamer sailed to rescue it.

<p>Answering Doubts About the Articles of Association</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Xingye Trust Company started its real estate trust business in the Chinese Concession last year, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically entrusted the company to handle various real estate matters. It is learned that the company has specially handled land registration procedures in order to meet the needs of the environment and issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Now the Shanghai Municipal Land Registration Implementation Rules were promulgated and implemented on April 1. The protection of land ownership and other rights is more thorough. However, owners may find it troublesome due to long distances or unfamiliar procedures. Our company has always adhered to the spirit of serving the society and handles all land registration matters on behalf of others. The procedures are simple and the handling is quick.

<h3>Dung Disturbance Occurs in Rihui Port</h3>
<p>Due to the Contractor Collecting Blocking Fees and Watchman Fees, More Than 300 Ships Have Stopped Operating</p>
<p>There are about three or four hundred dung boats engaged in transportation in the Rihui Port area of ​​South Shanghai. However, in recent days, the ship owners have suddenly had a dispute with the cleaning contractor Ma Hongji, and most of the ship owners have stopped transportation. It is reported that the biggest reason is that the contractor Ma Hongji suddenly raised the price of dung, from 40 cents per cart to 55 cents. In addition to the above-mentioned fixed price, he also ordered each ship owner to pay an unexpected blocking fee of 20 cents per ship and a watchman fee of 200 wen per ship, which aroused strong reactions from the ship owners. They unanimously opposed it and took passive resistance by stopping transportation. It is also learned that the ship owners have submitted appeals to various agencies such as the Municipal Government, the Municipal Finance Bureau, and the Health Bureau yesterday, requesting assistance.</p>
<h3>Siamese Man Sentenced for Teasing a Woman</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Twenty Days of Detention</p>
<p>Zhou Xingbao, a woman from Suzhou, is 29 years old this year. At about 9 p.m. the night before, she went to a shoe store in Xiaohuayuan to buy shoes alone. However, when she was walking at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, a Siamese man named John Tony (37 years old) suddenly came forward to tease her and hugged her. Zhou argued with him, but was beaten with fists, causing her nose and mouth to bleed and get injured. Later, Indian Constable No. 353 arrived and arrested John Tony, taking him to the Laozha Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, filed a lawsuit for injury under Article 277 of the Criminal Law, and stated that the defendant admitted in the police station yesterday that he hugged Zhou because he drank too much. He could not remember the beating. He submitted the confession to the court. According to Zhou Xingbao's statement, the defendant teased and beat her face. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he was walking at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Nanjing Road yesterday when the plaintiff suddenly stopped him. He pushed her casually, and the plaintiff fell to the ground and was injured. He did not beat her. After verifying the confession, Judge Pan Zhenyang sentenced the defendant John Tony to ten days of detention for injuring the body of another person. If he paid a fine instead, one day would be equivalent to two yuan.</p>
<h3>Maritime Accident Notes</h3>
<p>Huian Damaged in Collision</p>
<p>The Huian steamer of the Shanghai Zhengji Company set sail from Tianjin on the 11th of this month with cargo. It collided with the Fubi steamer of the British firm Chia Ho &amp; Co. in the Baihe River. The stern of the Huian steamer was severely damaged in the collision. A telegram arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The Shanghai Zhengji Company has telegraphed to inquire about the cause of the accident and the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>Chunhe Aground</p>
<p>The Chunhe steamer of the Dalu Industrial Company telegraphed from Tianjin to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, reporting that at 2 a.m. on the 11th, the steamer loaded wood from Fujian to Tianjin. It unloaded part of it at Tanggu and then sailed to Tianjin. When the ship arrived near Xinhe, it encountered wind and heavy fog, causing it to run aground. Repeatedly backing up failed to free it. It has now been decided to send barges to unload the cargo starting on the 12th and then tow it for rescue.</p>
<p>Daxing Damaged Rudder</p>
<p>The Daxing steamer of the Daxing Steamboat Company loaded cargo and passengers from Haimen at 5:12 p.m. on the 10th and sailed back to Shanghai. At 11 p.m., it arrived at Youpu, encountered a strong easterly wind, dropped its port anchor, and docked at the low tide wharf. At 11 a.m. on the 12th, when the anchor was raised and the ship started, the bow opened horizontally. Coincidentally, it was low tide and the stern of the ship ran aground on Nantian Dock. Although efforts were made to drive forward, the bow of the ship turned to the left and was relatively sluggish, causing the steering gear to be damaged and unable to operate. The damage was quite serious. Yesterday, the steamer managed to sail back to Shanghai and will be sent to the Jiangnan Shipyard for major repairs.</p>
<h3>Lying About Building a Railway to Defraud Deposits</h3>
<p>Zhuo Jing and Others are Accused</p>
<p>Zhuo Jing, who lives at No. 439, Route Mère Séverine, French Concession, has been working as an engineer. Although his family owns a large amount of property, it is controlled by his parents and cannot be used for his arbitrary wandering and spending, resulting in a large amount of debt that he cannot repay. Therefore, he had a whimsical idea and colluded with Deng Yuncheng, who lives in Hongxiang Lane, Xinzha Road, falsely claiming that the Anhui Guangde County Tongyu Coal Mine Company planned to build a transportation railway base of more than ten miles from the mine to the export point for transporting goods. The entire project was contracted out, and through Deng's introduction, it was contracted out to Gu Zhigui (37 years old, from Funing), the owner of Gu Guiji Construction Factory at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Zhongxing Road, Zhabei. In August of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the negotiations were completed, and in mid-November of the same year, both parties signed a contract, requiring Gu to pay a deposit of 2,000 yuan first. Later, after investigation, it was found that this was not the case, and it was realized that he had been deceived. He negotiated with the introducer and Zhuo, and only 300 yuan of the deposit was returned, with 1,700 yuan still remaining. It has been delayed until now, more than a year later, and after repeated negotiations, there has been no result. Recently, Gu hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Zhuo Jing and Deng Yuncheng for fraudulently obtaining property, and filed an incidental civil lawsuit to recover the defrauded and unreturned 1,700 yuan. According to the complaint, the court presided over the case in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. The plaintiff Gu Zhigui arrived with his lawyer and stated the circumstances of the fraud. Only the defendant Deng Yuncheng arrived for questioning. After a brief interrogation in court, it was ruled that another hearing would be held on a later date because the defendant Zhuo Jing did not arrive.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Jia Yi's Lawsuit for Restricting Freedom Opens Trial</h3>
<p>Zhang Suzhen Still Confesses to Having an Affair, Ding Xudong Recounts the Mediation Process</p>
<p>Lawyer Jia Yi filed a lawsuit in the District Court against Zhang Suzhen, a young woman from Suzhou, and lawyer Ding Xudong for restricting freedom. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Lu Hongyi opened the trial. According to Zhang Suzhen's confession, she is 24 years old, from Suzhou, and lives at No. 315, Xinjiang Road. Her husband is divorced. She previously filed a lawsuit against Chen Fengtai because Chen said he had no wife, which led to cohabitation. Later, his wife came out of the countryside,</p>
<p>So he was sued for abandonment.</p>
<p>When asked, "Did you originally ask Jia Yi to be your agent?" she replied, "Yes. On November 17 last year, the High Court ruled against me." When asked, "Who went to the Southeast Hotel first on January 30?" she replied, "I went with Jia Yi. It was at 7 p.m. He promised me money. I went to his office to find him. He said it was inconvenient to talk here. I waited until 7 p.m. and went to the hotel together. He used 270 yuan and two gold rings from me, which were borrowed on December 27 last year." When asked, "Where did you first have a relationship?" she replied, "In the Laojie Road office. It was in October,</p>
<p>After 8 p.m."</p>
<p>Going to Suzhou was on November 17. We opened the Dongwu Hotel. We arrived in Suzhou at 1 a.m. The court session ended at 4 p.m. We went to the hotel to sleep until 8 p.m. and then took a car to Shanghai. The IOU he gave me on January 30 was written by myself. When asked, "How was the IOU written?" she replied, "He borrowed 270 yuan and two gold rings from me." When asked, "Was he willing to write it?" she replied, "Yes." When asked, "Why didn't you write it then?" she replied, "He said he would pay it back soon. Besides, I wanted to be his wife, so I didn't write it. That night, I slept with him once. I asked him for money." When asked, "Besides you,</p>
<p>Who else was there?"</p>
<p>She replied, "No one." When asked, "Did Jia Yi say that Chen Changchun was your husband?" she replied, "No." When asked, "Did you say that you wouldn't write the IOU and would break his leg?" she replied, "I didn't say that. Later, lawyer Ding and Mr. Du came. Jia Yi called them." At this point, the judge asked Ding Xudong to testify. He said, "I live on Xinzha Bridge Road. I don't know Zhang Suzhen or Chen Changchun. On January 30, I was having dinner at home with Du Ernan, Jia's classmate.</p>
<p>I received a phone call</p>
<p>Asking me to go to the hotel. I saw two other people there. According to Jia, one was surnamed Chen, but I asked him and he said his surname was Zeng. I asked how long they had been there. He said 20 minutes. So Mr. Du proposed to report to the police. Jia said it was a matter of face. Later, Du and Jia negotiated and wrote a statement of separation. The woman wanted money. Jia made an appointment for February 5 and February 9. The IOU was written by someone surnamed Du. Jia Yi suggested it and Du wrote it. Du is from Dongtai and lives on Avenue Edward VII. He can be summoned as a witness." When asked, "Was Jia forced to write it?" he replied, "No. Besides,</p>
<p>The room was very small.</p>
<p>When I went, Jia said, 'Please write a mediation for me.' After it was settled, Jia, Du, and I went to Quanxingkang Hotel for refreshments. I paid the bill." At this point, the judge asked Jia Yi to testify. He said, "I am 36 years old and live at No. 149, Alley 1, Xinzha Road. Last year, Zhang sued Chen Fengtai and asked me to appear in court as an incidental civil lawsuit. She said she borrowed money from her on December 27 last year. In fact, she was very poor. The agreed-upon 50 yuan fee had not been paid yet. Going to Suzhou was with my wife and Zhang Suzhen. On that day, Zhu Sanmei signed her name and</p>
<p>Left a note</p>
<p>In the office. On January 30, at 7 p.m., I was instructed to go to the Southeast Hotel to discuss the case. When I arrived in the room, I saw Zhang Suzhen and two men. Later, two more men came." When asked, "Did you sleep?" he replied, "There were so many people, how could I sleep? But Ding Xudong has repeatedly said that I called him, but I never called him. He wants to shirk responsibility. He is on good terms with Chen Changchun." When asked, "Who called?" he replied, "I think it was</p>
<p>Thugs who beat me.</p>
<p>When Ding came, he said, 'You're out of luck. Chen said he wanted 1,000 yuan before, but Ding negotiated it down to 180 yuan.' I didn't agree. Ding said, 'Don't be ignorant.' At that time, I had no choice. He said he was leaving. If he left, you would be in danger. But Chen Changchun said, 'This is his woman.' I said, 'There is a case in court, how can you be her husband?' He said, 'You have to break up with her. If you are stubborn, you must have your legs broken.' Ding came when he said this, but he was a well-meaning person and could have called the police. But I really wanted to report to the police because I was guarded by three people and</p>
<p>Couldn't be free."</p>
<p>When asked, "Why did you not report the incident on January 30 until February 17?" he replied, "After the incident, the original introducers Ma Pengfei and Zhu Mei came to mediate. I told them to return the IOU and forget about it. Unexpectedly, I couldn't find Zhang Suzhen." At this point, Ma Pengfei testified. He is 35 years old, from Shaoxing, and works as a teacher at Zhengde Primary School in Zhengde Lane, Xiamen Road. When asked, "I know Zhu Sanmei. Sanmei knows Zhang Suzhen. I introduced the lawsuit. The public fee was not paid. I guaranteed it." At this point, the court adjourned the trial to another date.</p>
<h3>Zhao Liangen is Cut Down by Thugs</h3>
<p>At around 5:15 p.m. yesterday, a Ningbo man named Zhao Liangen, 33 years old, rushed out of the Yangtze Hotel on Hankou Road. Three strangers were following him. Just as he arrived in front of the Yan Maoyuan Hotel on Daxin Street, he was caught up by the three men. Without asking why, they hacked him with axes, injuring his shoulders twice, his legs once, his back three times, and his arms twice, for a total of nine ax wounds. Zhao fainted and fell to the ground, and blood gushed out like a spring. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the murderers fled in a swarm. After the injury, the police carried him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Later, the Laozha Police Station ordered Detective No. 116 to rush to the hospital to investigate. According to the injured person, he did not know the three murderers. However, he firmly refused to reveal the details.</p>
<h3>Luo Xi's Rape Case: He Kangli Appeals</h3>
<p>He Kangli, a native of Huarong, Hunan, is 27 years old this year. Because he raped Luo Xi (also known as Wei Xuezhen), a woman from Changsha, his hometown, in October of last year, Luo reported him to the French Police Station and He was detained and brought to the Second Special Court for public prosecution. Luo also filed an incidental civil lawsuit, seeking compensation for solace and alimony, totaling 20,200 yuan. The criminal part was sentenced by the Criminal Court to six months in prison, suspended for three years. The civil lawsuit part was also ruled by the Civil Court that He should compensate Luo with 1,000 yuan in national currency. He was dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Daqi of the Criminal Court of the Third Branch of the High Court came to the First Criminal Court to summon the appellant He Kangli to investigate the facts and reasons for the appeal in the criminal case. According to He's statement, Wei Xuezhen is the adopted daughter of Luo Qiaonian of Changsha, Hunan. Luo Qiaonian runs the Baihe Movie Theater in Xichulou, Changsha. Wei Xuezhen is registered in the household registration office of the First Sub-Bureau of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau of Hunan Province. She was registered as 17 years old last year and 18 years old this year. She had a relationship with me last year and was already 16 years old. She presented several students from the Xinhua Art School as witnesses in the original trial, but there were no such witnesses in the Xinhua School. The original sentence of six months in prison cannot be accepted. The judge asked, "Do you know that it is a crime to have sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16?" He replied, "I know." The judge asked, "Since you know, why didn't you investigate Wei Xuezhen's age and have a relationship with her in such a confused way?" He replied, "I was not the only one who had a relationship with her, but also people with the surnames Liu and Li. I met her in October last year. She came to my place and slept on my bed three times in a row. I was tempted by her and couldn't help but have a relationship with her. I also changed her name to Luo Yi and gave me three photos. On the back of the photos, she wrote words to seduce me. At the same time, when I had a relationship with her, she said she was 17 years old and was born in March. I thought it was not a crime to have a relationship with a girl who was already 16 years old, etc." The court verified the confession and ruled that the trial would be held on a scheduled date and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Those Unrelated to the Private Sale of Counterfeit Money Case are Released First</h3>
<p>Jiang Futian, an inspector of the French Police Station, and detectives Zhang Daorong and Dai Rongji, etc., cracked the case of private sale of counterfeit money on the 4th of this month at the Xinxin Hotel on Min Tinei Yin Road and the upstairs of Wu Senji opposite, and at No. 13, Lane 110, Chengdu Road, etc. The nine men and women, including Wu Rongguang's wife Chen Erbao (also known as Chen Zhou, Wang Shisheng's concubine), Wang Shisheng (also known as Sun Shaoshan), Hua Chunlin, Tu Wenhu, Wu Fujin, Zhao Jifu, Zhu Huaiqing, and Li Mi, were arrested. Three hundred yuan of one-yuan counterfeit money from the Central Bank was seized from Wu Rongguang, and five hundred yuan of five-yuan counterfeit money from the Bank of China was seized from Chen Erbao. They were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Shuoying came to the First Criminal Court to interrogate the defendants. Only Wang Shisheng hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him in court. Lawyer Chen Ming of the Police Department presented the case and prosecuted Wu Rongguang, Chen Erbao, Wang Shisheng, and Hua Chunlin for the crime of using counterfeit currency under Article 196 of the Criminal Law, and stated that Wang Shisheng had previously been sentenced to five years in prison by the court for a counterfeit money case. Tu Wenhu, Wu Fujin, Zhao Jifu, Zhu Huaiqing, and Li Mi were found to have no criminal behavior and were not prosecuted. He asked to release them first. The court verified the report and examined the Police Department's investigation file incompletely, and was unable to start the trial. Therefore, it was ruled that the trial would be held again at 9 a.m. on the 15th. The defendants were sent back to prison, and the five defendants who were not prosecuted should be released.</p>
<h3>Japanese Female School Teachers and Students Sketch in the Fields</h3>
<p>Police Order Them to Return to School</p>
<p>Quangu Jin, a Japanese teacher at the Japanese Women's Higher School on Ouyang Road, Public Concession, took four female students to sketch on the ground in the fields behind the Lai Yidu Youth Association in Pudong the day before yesterday morning. The villagers were suspicious when they saw them and reported them to the police. The teacher was taken to the Pudong Branch Bureau. After questioning, it was learned that they were there to practice sketching. He was told that without a notification from the General Bureau, they were not allowed to sketch. Therefore, he left a drawing board and reported it to the Bureau for safekeeping. He also sent the five Japanese men and women to the Quanchunjiang Wharf and sent them back to school.</p>
<h3>A Teenage Girl Becomes Obsessed with Buddhism and Her Nerves Change</h3>
<p>Escapes from a Mental Hospital, Suspiciously Wandering by the River</p>
<p>At 12 o'clock the night before, a young woman, dressed in fashionable clothes with permed hair, resembling a student, wandered around the Quanchunjiang Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong, as if she wanted to commit suicide by jumping into the river. The police officer, fearing that something unexpected would happen in the middle of the night, took her back to the Pudong Branch Bureau. When asked why she didn't leave late at night, she smiled and didn't answer, as if she had a mental illness. She refused to reveal her name, age, address, or place of residence. Later, a Bureau member took her to a quiet room and questioned her in detail. She only wrote Zhang Xiaomei, 17 years old, Shanghai, etc., in eight characters with a pencil. Then she explained that she walked out of the warehouse. As there were no clues, Cai's daughter was arranged to sleep with her that night. Gradually, her real name was revealed as Zhang Lifeng, who lived in the Nanhua Bookstore Building in Anji Lane, Wumalu, etc. Yesterday morning, detectives were sent to summon her family. The woman's brother-in-law, Bei Hentian, filed a statement with the Branch Bureau, claiming that Lifeng had received a considerable education and liked to study Buddhist books. Because she was young and weak-willed, she became obsessed with it and often stayed up all night, talking to herself in a murmur, and her nerves changed. A few days ago, she was ordered to go to the dance floor to play to relieve her obsession, but after only three weeks, she relapsed. She had no choice but to send her to a mental hospital for treatment on the 12th of last month. She suddenly escaped yesterday, and her family searched all the stations and wharves in vain and was extremely anxious. The Branch Bureau Chief ruled that she should be found and bailed out.</p>

<h3>General's Temple on Huangqiao Ridge</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>—Random Notes on Mountain Travels—</p>
<p>Currently, we are resting at the Li family inn on Huangqiao Ridge. Judging by the journey, Huangqiao Ridge is not really a place to stay. At most, it's a place for passersby to grab a snack when they are hungry and thirsty, rest their legs, eat a couple of ears of corn, and then have a bowl of tofu pudding, which is quite appropriate. If it's just one or two people staying, it's manageable, but a large group would be a bit overwhelming. However, we can't worry about that. Being "neither near a village nor a shop," we have no choice but to stay.</p>
<p>This place has fewer than a hundred households in total. Once you leave the village entrance, you can see the majestic appearance of Huangqiao Ridge. It's not tall, resembling an old man with a hunched back, stretching his chest tightly towards the ground. The river? It's not narrow, about five or six zhang wide, crashing against the pebbles in the riverbed and flowing downwards with a "shua shua" sound. The water is shallow these days, revealing the sandy riverbed on both sides. The embankments are pitifully low, and the houses along the river are built on the embankments. Opening the window, the river scenery and mountain colors jump clearly into view.</p>
<p>Behind the houses along the north side of the street, there is a small temple. The temple doesn't enshrine mountain gods or bodhisattvas, but rather two very young children. The candlesticks in front of them have long been lost. The accumulated dust is quite thick, and their faces are no longer clearly visible. Their bodies are also incomplete. The small house is naturally dilapidated. I thought that perhaps it was built in the beginning for some special achievement, but this achievement, due to the passage of time and changing circumstances, has been placed in a state of decline.</p>
<p>At night, a silver river opens, surrounded by starlight, blinking like golden specks shimmering on the river surface. Without moonlight, the surroundings are so silent that you can hear the sound of leaves falling. I moved two clusters of long oranges and sat with the innkeeper at the entrance of the street, letting the dew of the quiet night sprinkle on our backs. The fleeting clouds passed gently with the evening breeze.</p>
<p>During the conversation, I should thank him for telling me that the small temple behind the houses along the street is called "General's Temple." From its construction to the present, it's impossible to remember how many years it has been. The so-called "General" can be said to be the reward for sacrifice. Within it lies a tragic and incredible story!</p>
<p>This river used to be wider than it is now. When the currents converged, the waves were very turbulent. After many repairs, the river has narrowed and can no longer stir up the angry waves of the past. Every year, during the flood season, the residents here are often buried in water. The beloved farmland becomes a pool of water that doesn't recede. Light floods affect five or six villages, while severe floods spread out, and the suffering is unimaginable.</p>
<p>The Zhang and Li families live on the east side of the street, and they both have only sons, one named "Dang Lao" and the other named "De Zhu." The two are about the same age, probably around ten years old. One year, this river unleashed its power again, out of control. Overnight, the villagers didn't dare to sleep. Doors, oranges... anything they could find was used to block the breached gaps, while a message was rushed upwards. However, with few people and little strength, they gradually couldn't hold on. By the time officials were sent, the water was already waist-deep.</p>
<p>The county magistrate had a dream beforehand, saying that Dang Lao and De Zhu from this village could stop this flood. So, he searched everywhere for them. As a result, these two children served as cannon fodder on the front line, and the flood subsided. To show their great merit, the temple was built at the entrance of the street, receiving the worship of the villagers, and they were even bestowed the title of "General"!</p>
<p>I don't want to comment on this incredible story. I don't know if the plot was like this at the time. The power of divine authority still dominates this ancient village. The temple is dilapidated beyond recognition, but the river under Huangqiao Ridge still crashes against the pebbles, flowing downwards with a "shua shua" sound. If there is another flood, I'm afraid even the "General's Temple" will suffer.</p>
<h3>Journey</h3>
<p>— Zhang Hai</p>
<p>When the east showed the white light of dawn, we packed up and set off, planning to reach "Jiagesai," the place where Inner and Outer Mongolia meet, by dark. We bid farewell to the silent "Kaduo Village" and headed towards the distant plains. Last night, the herdsmen of "Kaduo Village" told us that the road ahead would be much easier, so we decided to walk, only hiring two camels to carry our luggage. The waning crescent moon of April illuminated the sleeping grassland, and the faint shadows of us travelers brushed across the grass, so lonely, so melancholic. The moonlight gradually faded, and the morning light rose from the eastern horizon, slowly brightening the colors of the plains. The sound of camel hooves and human coughs occasionally punctuated the quiet world. Lulu had fully recovered her health from three days ago, and she sang cheerful love songs from her hometown, dreamlike, so sweet, so fulfilling. Clearly, the fresh air filled everyone's hearts, as if they had been given a morphine injection. Pan Lesky, Kerwell, and I talked with great interest about the folk tales of the "Volga" Riverbank. Lulu always wanted to hear stories and hum tunes at the same time. Shen Lesky had a belly full of stories, with various folk tales of different flavors. He told them vividly, leaving a deep impression on the listeners, especially in understanding the national character and people's lives of a particular place from the stories. He had traveled to many places: the Caucasus, Ukraine, and Buryat Mongolia. He had also been to places like Paris and Berlin, but he was tired of those cities. He liked the "Volga River" and the great Siberian forests.</p>
<p>We walked and talked along the way, and everyone forgot their fatigue. After walking more than ten miles out of Kaduo Village, we reached a mountain pass. This mountain was not very high, with trees and rocks. At the foot of the mountain was a stream, winding eastward across the plains. The clear, clear water gurgled, seemingly trying to soothe the loneliness of this grassland. The elm trees on the banks of the stream were blooming with purple cotton-like flowers, releasing fragrant breaths in bursts. Spread before us was the green grassland, as flat and boundless as a green sea. In the distance were herds of grazing livestock, and occasionally the sound of horses neighing could be heard. We sat on the grass by the stream. The camels drank water with a "gudong gudong" sound, and we sang "Volga Boatmen's Song" with great enthusiasm. Lulu played wildly, rolling on the grass, yelling, and chasing after Kerwell (one running, one chasing). By this time, the sun was already halfway up the sky, and the entire mountain and field were covered in sunshine. Finally, we went up the mountain hand in hand, and we all prepared guns. Strangely, there were no wild animals on this mountain, not even rabbits. But there were many birds, all unknown, flying back and forth among the branches, singing in high-pitched voices. They were praising the spring!</p>
<p>We happily moved forward in the sunshine. We didn't encounter any sandy areas on the way, so walking wasn't tiring at all, especially for Pan Lesky, who talked like a pair of parrots, always telling stories that made people excited. He truly understood the psychology of travelers. Travelers don't need tragic stories. Kerwell especially liked to hear stories about women. When Pan Lesky talked about the women of the Caucasus, he listened intently, having long forgotten about teasing Lulu.</p>
<p>We arrived at the "Jiagesai Well" at a leisurely pace, just as the sun was setting. There was water to drink, firewood to burn, and the herdsmen generously provided us with shelter and food. At first, the herdsmen were very surprised, wondering why there were Americans. Later, we explained to them that we were going to Xinjiang and were passing through here. Although Kerwell was an American, he had lived in Buryatia for a long time, and he had become a citizen of Buryat Mongolia three years ago. Then the herdsmen were happy and warmly welcomed us.</p>
<p>Reluctantly leaving "Jiagesai Well," we traveled more than sixty miles before reaching "Suhutu Well." In fact, this couldn't be considered a well, it was just a spring, two or three feet deep, with water containing salt. It tasted quite bad. Walking along the spring, we reached a mountain with five large trees at its foot, all with dense green leaves.</p>
<p>After passing "Sha'er Naohai," we walked through more than ten miles of sandy ditches before reaching "Sheng Fa Kui." "Sheng Fa Kui" was originally the name of a store. It was originally opened by people from Shanxi, and over the years, this business name became the name of the place. In the past, "Sheng Fa Kui" was a series of winding low mountains, twisting and turning. At the foot of the mountains were ravines with elm trees, with lush branches and leaves. We stayed here for lunch.</p>
<p>After inquiring about the route to Xinjiang at "Niao Lan Taoer Hai," we decided not to go through Ningxia and wanted to travel west from here.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Workers Going Abroad</h3>
<p>— Fang Kewen</p>
<p>During the European War, China was said to have benefited from the "victory of justice" in the sense that it sent workers abroad to help the Allied countries in the war effort. As the trend spread, going abroad "to work or peddle" became one of the ways out for those who couldn't find bread at home. However, recently, this path has also become "this road is blocked." Due to their own internal contradictions, various countries have seen a gradual increase in unemployment. If their own people have nothing to eat, they naturally won't allow foreigners to come and share their meager earnings. Among these, especially the Chinese compatriots of "small and weak nations," are often "sent back" to their home country in large numbers. Those sent back are mostly from Qingtian and Yongjia, because they mostly "work or peddle" abroad, and their lives are simple, their wages are low, and they are also able to endure hardship and hard work, and they rarely resist scolding, which is of great benefit to the profits of capitalists, far beyond what local workers can achieve. However, although there are many benefits for capitalists, there are also more troubles for the government of the host country, and many inconveniences in solving unemployment problems. For the sake of passively remedying the situation, they are sent back to their home country. As for students or those sent abroad for inspection, because they are consumers, they are of course welcomed and there is no hesitation in driving them away.</p>
<p>But it is very strange that now there are "large numbers of ruffians in various coastal areas of Wenzhou, using the ease of making profits in Europe and the comfort of life as propaganda" to persuade "strong and useful workers." They say that "the Italian shipping company will give preferential treatment to Chinese people from this month onwards. For every one hundred people going abroad, the fare can be calculated at half price. If there is no work to be done in Italy, Italians can also send them to Abyssinia to reclaim wasteland, where they can earn huge wages."</p>
<p>The power of this persuasion must be very great. From the fact that the Wenzhou gentry submitted a document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs "to quickly stop it," it can be imagined that the gentry's reason for requesting "to quickly stop it" is that "after these workers go abroad, they will either wander in foreign lands or marry and have children and live overseas for a long time, causing the land in their hometown to gradually become barren, which will inevitably affect local construction." According to the results of the investigation, "there are already more than 10,000 people in Italy. If workers continue to be exported every month, Wenzhou will inevitably become a region of the old and young in three or several years."</p>
<p>China is an agricultural country, and farmers are mostly conservative. Now they are actually leaving their hometowns and going to "foreign lands" with sparse populations to work. The reasons for this are worth considering. The gentry seem to be quite worried about "the land in their hometown gradually becoming barren," which shows their concern for their hometown. However, if "the land in their hometown" is not "gradually becoming barren" or if there are other unspeakable hardships, I don't think these villagers would necessarily be willing to live a wandering life in "foreign lands."</p>
<p>However, now they seem to be quite swayed by the "propaganda" of "wandering," abandoning "the important task of local construction" and going to "foreign lands" to "marry and have children." In addition to stipulating three preventative measures, it seems that we may as well think carefully or conduct a field investigation:</p>
<p>Why are they willing to go to "Abyssinia to reclaim land," far across the ocean?</p>
