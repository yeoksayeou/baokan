<p>犯廣福鎮之敵被驅至公路附近　蕰藻浜之敵被包圍將全部殲滅　閘北方面竟日激戰我節節勝利</p>
<p>敵第四次總攻顯已遭受嚴重打擊、十日來北自施相公廟廣福鎮之東、蕰藻浜兩岸、南迄江灣閘北全綫、敵一再猛烈進犯、毫無進展、蕰藻浜兩岸昨日敵軍雖仍困鬥、但所謂總攻實已成尾聲、中央社隨軍記者昨冒雨赴前綫各軍次訪問、悉我軍自昨日起、已改守為攻、三日來以蕰藻浜為中心之兩岸、戰事頗為激烈、敵犯西六房宅、已經擊退、而向廣福鎮進撲之一部、經我逐步追擊、已驅敵於滬太公路附近、並收復重要據點多處、至渡過蕰藻浜之一部經我反攻後、已殲滅其大半、侷處沿浜一帶之殘敵、雖尚有二千人、但毫無根據、被我包圍、昨日下午曾迫令繳械、惟殘敵頑强、我軍予以痛懲、卽可全部解决、又盤踞於蕰藻浜車站之敵、似有西進模樣、我為先發制人計、亦由廟行方面突然進攻、敵出其不意、受創甚重、值此全國熱烈慶祝聲中、我忠勇將士、奮其神威、重創敵軍、益增我爭取最後勝利之自信力、</p>
<p>敵軍揚言可於十月十五日突破我陣地、壓迫我軍退至嘉定南翔之綫、故第四次總攻開始後、先由太平橋寶家弄突破我滬太公路之綫、卽不斷以重兵猛犯我廣福及施相公廟兩點、但經我奮勇抗戰、業已遭受嚴重之打擊、乃改變目標、於本月三日用毒瓦斯等非法武器·强渡蕰藻浜後、以為卽可長驅直入、敵又宣稱、可於十月十日達到目的、詎意又遭我軍猛烈之反攻、進退失據、惜連日天雨、田地積水、我軍行動不便、故未能早日將敵掃蕩肅淸、連日在廣福鎮正面陣地、將敵擊退後、敵已向南移動、故自九日起、該處戰鬥已較前緩和、惟蘊藻浜北岸唐橋站陸家巷間戰事、則漸趨激烈、我唐橋西南沿警戒綫、雖有數處被敵突破、但我已調生力部隊向敵包抄、猛力圍攻、敵策應南岸黑大黃宅部隊之企圖、必難得逞、</p>

<h3>到勝利的路</h3>
<p>— 胡愈之</p>
<p>中華民國已經有二十六年的歷史了，但是全民族對外戰爭，現在却還是第一次。自然我們也曾參加了世界大戰，但是誰也知道，中國在大戰中只是名義上的參戰，至多也不過跟着恊約國，搖旗吶喊而已。眞正的對外戰爭在民國歷史中却還不曾有過。</p>
<p>眞正的對外戰爭，是國與國的戰爭。敵人用了全國的力量來侵略屠殺我們。我們自然也只有用了全國的力量保衛我們自己。</p>
<p>所謂全國的力量，這一句話是應該特別重視的。在淸代，我們經過了許多次的對外戰爭，經過了中英戰爭，中法戰爭，中俄戰爭，和第一次中日戰爭。但是所得到的結果，只是妥洽，屈服，割地，賠款。這就因為在淸代，我們並沒有用全國的力量，從事對外抗戰，而且也不可能用全國的力量，從事對外抗戰。原來當時的“國”，是淸室所私有的“國”，而並不是四萬萬人民共有的“國”。淸室的大臣剛毅有“與其授家奴，不如贈隣友”之語。淸室的上諭，並且主張“量中華之物力，結友邦之歡心”，在這樣的政治條件之下，要動員全國的力量，以對外抗戰，是斷沒有可能的。</p>
<p>“與其授家奴，不如贈隣友”的政策，到底把淸朝三百年的統治斷送了。到了辛亥革命以後，“國”已是四萬萬人共有的國，而不是少數人的私產了。但是因為民國成立以來，並沒有經過一次眞正的對外戰爭，所以到最近為止，人們並沒有眞正感覺到“國”的需要，“國”的寶貴。辛亥革命之後，我們為了內部問題，整整地鬧了二十五年。直到日寇侵佔了中國三分之一土地，而且經過了六年國難之後，我們才覺醒過來，全國團結一致對外。這是我們所不必諱言的啊。</p>
<p>現在有一種主張，不但在國外流行着，而且在國內也竟有一部分人迷信着。就是说：“一個國家只有對內實行專制獨裁，才能對外强硬，民主政治對外是沒有力量的。”希特勒這样主張，墨索里尼這樣主張，日本軍閥也這樣主張，這都沒有错，因為法西斯侵略者，國內的人民都反對戰爭，所以要從事對外侵略，首先必须在國內實行專制獨裁。可是在愛好和平的國家以及被侵略的國家，郤是剛巧相反。被侵略的國家，人民都願意保衛祖國而戰爭，所反對的只是對外屈服投降。所以只有民主政治，才能增加了對外抵抗的力量。專制獨裁的結果，郤只有使國家的力量削弱。淸朝末年的政策，就是一個榜樣。</p>
<p>被侵略的國家，要向强大的敵人實行抗戰，有兩個必要條件，就是統一和民主。而這兩個條件又是不能分開的。沒有統一，固然沒有民主：沒有民主，團結統一，也斷不能鞏固。</p>
<p>現在團結統一是已經成為事實了。我們所需要的，就只是民主。抗戰時期需要民主，這是極容易明白的。假如人民都知道自己是國家的主人，沒有一個人不願意為保衛祖國而獻身。要是人民和國家本來就沒有多大干係，那麼卽使勉强抗戰，勝利的把握是很少的。</p>
<p>沒有比在抗戰時期更需要民衆的了。前方人力的補充，需要民衆。軍隊的運輸接濟，需要民衆。後方的供應救護，需要民衆。在全民的抗戰中，勝負並不倚靠武器來决定，而是倚靠動員的人數多寡來决定。這動員不僅是軍事方面，而且包含政治方面，經濟方面，勞動方面，技術方面，文化方面。在國內戰爭中，所需要的不過是一部分傭雇的軍隊，而在對外戰爭中，尤其是對强大的侵略者的抗戰中，必然需要全體民衆來參加。但是廣大的民衆，要是不能參加國家的政治，是不是都能自發地英勇地參加對外戰爭，實在是一個疑問。</p>
<p>漢奸的活動到處存在着，誠然是一種可恥的事實。但是中國人中間有漢奸，這並不能說明中國人不愛國。我相信大部分的漢奸都是因為他們的生活和國家太無干係，所以才會認賊作父。</p>
<p>所以要支持抗戰，達到最後的勝利，只有一條大路，就是民主。只要澈底實現三民主義，澈底實行民治民有民享的原則，把一切民衆都組織起來，使一切人民都享有合法的自由，不但全民動員，可以立卽完成，而且以四萬五千萬同胞的統一力量，為反對外來侵略而戰鬥，最後的勝利是不成問題的。而且也只有這樣，才是唯一的勝利的道路。</p>
<p>今天是國慶日，也是我們對暴日實行抗戰以後的第一個國慶日。假如我們不忘記為民族獨立自由而殉身的先烈，假定我們還謹記着國父孫中山先生的遺敎，我們就應該一心一意，大家起來，依着民主統一的路徑，來給垂危的中華民國，爭取光榮的勝利。“對敵人要殘酷，對自己人要寬容！”這句話尤其要讓大家時刻謹記着。</p>

<h3>在轟炸中來去</h3>
<p>— 郭沫若</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>二十一日傍晚抵蘇州，用電話叩問樵峯，樵峯已去矣。當夜决於吳縣留宿。</p>
<p>宿處有桂花，在暗中吐放着濃重甜蜜的香氣。時有飛機來的警報，但余郤甚泰然。睡眠甚安穩，因一切行裝乃來時在上海所新製者，頗覺舒適宜人也。</p>
<p>次日，因須等汽車從前方開來，便得到了充分的閑暇，午前在蘇州市上觀光了一遍。市民尚鎮靜，但商店多閉戶，這心理覺得有些可笑。閉戶大約是禦防轟炸吧，然而飛機的炸彈如投不中你的店舖，你何須乎關門！如投中了你的店舖，關門又有何益呢？大家與其說太不不夠勇敢，寗可說太不够聰明。</p>
<p>想起了蘇州有兩位老前輩是值得專誠拜訪的，一位是李根源先生，一位是張一摩先生，這張李二公，據我的拜訪所得的印象而言，實在是值得稱為“天下之大老。”</p>
<p>李先生是在一座小小的農人家里遇着的，穿着異常樸素，一見便令人聯想上“三國志演義”上的關壯繆。</p>
<p>先生精神甚好，但右頸上有某種皮膚病，皮呈古銅色的鱗片狀，因而右顎下的淋𣲩腺的浮腫。先生雄於談，音調甚激烈，猶言當年叱咜三軍之槪。</p>
<p>先生說，他的主張是“內王外霸，”他主張中國的動向只宜注重國防，一切粉飾太平的建設都是不需要，這次淞滬抗戰的結果便證明了。</p>
<p>先生又說，他對於蔣先生，在十三號以前，他也不甚佩服，但目十三號以後，他可以向他叩頭了。</p>
<p>説這些話的時候，態度異常誠懇，炯炯的眼光似乎有潤意，臉上也浮出了細密的汗珠。</p>
<p>蘇州的美國敎士於救護傷兵事甚為熱心，士兵以入蘇州病院為樂，蓋外科手術旣佳，而待遇又好也。美使詹森喪命敎士們退出中國，而敎士們不肯。——這消息也是李先生告訴我的。</p>
<p>李先生的印象旣像關羽；張先生的印象則頗類諸葛孔明·。張先生人不甚高，顏面作三角形，無髯，白皙，雖無綸巾羽扇，然其淸明之氣藹如也。</p>
<p>張先生便是在最近報章上傳播一時的“老子軍”的組織者。他的組織經蔣先生的電阻，自然中輟了，但他有一通復電，報上却尚未傳播。張先生把那電稿了出來給我看，稿子是用墨筆寫在幾張大型壁曆的廢紙背上。文辭懇切動人，我要先生拿在“救亡日報”上發表，先生慨諾了。</p>
<p>先生說，他前幾天在某處遇見馮煥章先生，煥章先生說他精神很好，他說：“我平常並不好，時常生病，但自八一三以來。我的精神便百倍起來，什麼病都沒有了。”</p>
<p>先生又說，我們中國人素來是伸不起腰的，但是我們這次却伸起腰來了。我們中國人平常打死一兩個日本人，立刻要賠款兩三萬，但這次我們已經打死了他兩三萬人，這如在平時，不知道又要該賠多少款。先生呌我“統計”一下，說“怕有很多的零吧。”</p>
<p>先生書案上正寫就一張短軸，是臨的蘇長公的“天際帖，”“中秋後二日”所書·中秋後二日即余抵蘇之九月二十一日也。我便請求先生的墨寶，先生說，就把這張送你作為紀念吧，不過沒有上款，不要緊吧？我說，沒有上款正好。（是的，實在正好，假使像先生這樣的人為我落個上款，而客氣地稱為“先生，”那我是要永远感到惭愧的。”</p>
<p>於是先生便連忙去取了張報紙來，把字條捲好，遞了給我。</p>
<p>我眞眞是感覺着獲得了一件無上的寶貝。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國的態度</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>英首相張伯倫日前在保守黨大會演說。對美國羅斯福總統關於世界大局的主張。表示贊許。并鄭重聲明。“英政府願與各國通力合作。維護條約。推進和平。”英美兩大友邦為要阻止國際侵略勢力的滋長。現在對于九國公約及非戰公約。一致有了切實擔負義務的初步表示。這是遭受着侵略的我們覺得非常的感奮的。</p>
<p>可是我們不能不指出。條約文字上的規定不少含混的處所。必須各和平國家下着切實制裁侵略者的决心。方才可使條約發生眞正的效力。否則條約還是要變成‘一撮廢紙。’反使侵略者的氣燄更高漲。從過去的歷史事實上。我們找得出不少的例證來。</p>
<p>英國朝野各方面對于我國的同情以及對于遠東侵略者的痛恨。誠然是亳無疑問的了。但我們却還不免懷疑到英政府為了世界的和平。為了自國前途的利害關係。是否已有聯合其他和平國家。共同制裁侵略勢力的决心。最近國聯决議案的避免‘侵略’字样。英國輿論界（如倫敦泰晤士報每日快報每日電聞乃至上海字林西報等）的反對經濟制裁。以及英政府對於九國公約會議地點的推諉。這些事實都表明着英国還是不願開罪侵略國家。還是在十字路上徘徊着。</p>
<p>英國這一種傳統態度。顯然已使世界和平大受威脅。而美帝國的威望也大見减削了。我們希望國際形勢的新發展不再容許它徘徊在十字路上。</p>

<h3>雙十節的南京路</h3>
<p>羣衆的呼聲響徹雲霄　我們是一個鐵的集團　我們要驅逐敵人出境</p>
<p>（本報特寫）再沒有今年的雙十節使人興奮的了！前綫將士，在敵人的砲火底下，為民族生存而抗戰：後方民衆抗敵情緒又怎樣地亢奮，以血底記號來歡迎第二十六度國慶日的降臨，我沒有更好的詞句來形容，當靑天白日滿地紅的旗幟在家家戶戶的屋頂上飄揚的時候，——中華民族底靈魂在怒吼了！</p>
<p>早上九點鐘，我就和一位朋友冒着雨踏上南京路。馬路經過整夜雨水的沖洗，幾乎像鏡面一樣地平滑晶潔，飄揚在天空的國旗，不待我抬起頭來，路面上清晰的倒影已經映進我的眼簾，於是這馬路對於我漸漸生疏起來；要不是有幾個巡捕在人行道上巡查，我將忘記置身在租界上了。走到拋球塲附近，我的同伴首先看見有人在商店的玻璃窗上貼標語，“打倒日本帝國主義！”彷彿一個炸彈似的在每個行人的血管里爆炸起來，立即有無數張嘴在不同的方向高喊着。巡查的巡捕雖然跟着把那些標語撕下來，但是他們祇是為了職務關係，後面的剛撕去，前面的墨漬又張貼在玻璃窗上了。</p>
<p>江海關上的大鐘剛敲十二點鐘的時候，無綫電里傳播出雄壯的黨歌，這時候在馬路上的行人，都在雨中站定了，大家嚴肅地跟着唱，在這雄壯的聲音中，無量數堅强的心聯系了起來，“我們是一個鐵的集團！我們要打倒我們唯一的敵人！”這聲音從我背後傳來的時候，南京路的十字路口飛來十幾輛祥生汽車，每一輛汽車里有四五人，五六人不等，他們都迅速地從車廂里跳出來，無數傳單分送到人們的手里，同時，“起來，不願做奴隸的人們！”的義勇軍進行曲從每一個角落里高唱起來。商店里的小職員，就把分來的傳單握在手里，他們似乎沒有多餘的功夫細看傳單上寫些什麼，仰起頭，“冒着敵人的砲火，前進！前進！前進！進！”地跟着唱。這歌詞對於他門實在是太親切了，而且他們是怎樣逼切地希望有一個機會把積壓着的悲憤溶合在這雄壯的歌聲中！</p>
<p>一遍，一遍…直到有人喊口號的時候才停止。但是“打倒日本帝國主義軀逐敵人出境！三民主義萬歲！中國國民黨萬歲！中華民國萬歲！一的呼聲更高亢地響應着。</p>
<p>這樣慷慨激昂的情形是每次羣衆塲面中所未見的，更難能可貴的是每個人都能嚴守秩序。當十幾輛汽車開始游行，無數的羣衆如潮一樣跟着走的時候，巡捕都比較客氣地帮同維持秩序，祇是汽車到成都路的時候，他們不許向西駛行，於是汽車向南轉入威海衛路而去，但是徒步的羣衆還是唱着進行曲向西前進。</p>
<p>同時在法租界黄金大戲院門口也同樣展開了莊嚴的紀念式：在正午十二點鐘，十字路口的交通暂時宣吿斷絕，所有車輛都停了起來，也有人從汽車中走出來站在馬路上，唱過了黨歌，義勇軍進行曲，高喊口號而散。</p>
<p>我們轉入一條冷落的馬路</p>
<p>，歸來的時候，看見一隊孩子，山最大的一個做首領，握着一面小國旗，一邊高唱義勇軍進行曲，從一條小衖走出來，這不是小孩子們普通無意識的游戲，乃是現代小學敎育進步的象徵。</p>
<p>再沒有今年的雙十節使人興奮的了！（蘋）</p>
<h3>南洋僑胞努力捐輸救國</h3>
<p>商店小販婦女踴躍捐募　抵制敵貨日商門可羅雀</p>
<p>我國南洋僑胞、自滬戰發生後、多積極努力於救國工作、上自各大商人、下至販夫走卒、無一不樂於解囊、爲祖國捐輸者、愛國心之熱烈、較之國內人士有增無减、茲錄南洋某鉅商來函、以見其實情一斑、</p>
<p>商店認捐</p>
<p>南洋地方各大小商號均有認捐、計特別捐、即一次拿出若干、另捐月捐、每月負担若干、至戰事停止為止、此二種頗為可觀、</p>
<p>小販報效</p>
<p>不論販夫走卒、愛國心頗熱烈、馬路上之賣冰水、賣糖菓者、均以全日收入連本報效、其他炒麵攤、賣夜茶等處、大都定一日期將該晚營業收入、全數報効、（賣茶者均有女招待者、每晚約有四五十元或一二十元之數、）炒麵攤連本報効、為數頗巨、約在一二百元之間、其他如搬貨汽車、各種小工等等、均有以一日收入報効者、</p>
<p>賣花女郎</p>
<p>女傭人·女學生·家庭婦女·甚至妓女·均自備鮮花或紙花、向商店或路人兜售、將所得捐至祖國以上捐款、除特別捐、月捐二種、大都各帮人歸各帮會館徵收、轉交籌賑會後發給收據、其他報效者、則各有鉛皮箱一只、係籌賑會發給、捐錢者自己擲入箱內、該箱任何大均可往領、</p>
<p>戲院遊藝</p>
<p>最近各遊藝塲等、多開籌賑會捐募獻國、（塲內售物各廠商報效）大世界各歌劇團、各學校男女生數千人均參加歌唱進行曲及“抗敵歌等、</p>
<p>徵收舊衣</p>
<p>沿途搖鈴、用搬貨汽車、徵求舊衣服者、每日有多次在店面行過、現就星埠一處、已有數十萬件收到、第一批聞已裝出、捐原疋白布以供包紥受傷者亦頗多、其他各埠、聞亦有數十萬件、將裝回國內、</p>
<p>日人商店</p>
<p>日本人所開之商店、門可羅雀華人抵制十分劇烈、英美貨物則銷路大增、Craven“A”（每包一角）香烟、及電燈牌（每包五分）香烟、本爲此處銷數最多者、此次被人散佈謠言、為該公司借款與日人故全馬來亞華人、均不吸此烟現該公司每天登报闢謠且捐出巨量香烟、惟欲恢復以前銷路、　恐已甚難、其他如拔打鞋店等、亦存此事發生、藉此可見華僑力量之偉大、</p>
<p>華人商店</p>
<p>華人店家如捐款不出者、（出得稍遲一點）每易遭受營業上之大影響、因目前衆怒難犯也、聞有大三元餅家者、因出捐款不爽氣、中秋前所預製之大帮月餅　竟無人向其代售及購買、此種事當不止一起、尚有多家相同之事云、</p>
<h3>商民一致慨認公債</h3>
<p>南洋烟公司廿五萬　商界總隊續募九萬　紗業分隊六萬三千</p>
<p>南洋兄弟烟草公司總廠設百老滙路此次日軍再犯、該廠首當其衝、損失殊重、除將該廠職工給資遣送外、該公司在香港·新加坡各分廠、仍努力製造、繼續奮鬥、並表示救國熱忱起見、特認購救國公債二十五萬元、並訂定全體職工、長期捐款捐薪辦法、㊀各長工長期捐薪百分之五、㊁長期提捐營業總額千分之三、㊂長期提捐伙食百分之十、㊃各代理店長期提捐佣金百分之二、㊄各義校敎職員、長期捐薪百分之五、㊅各義校學生長期節食捐助、</p>
<p>救國公債商界勸募總隊、昨又據各業報到募得公債數如下、電器製造業三萬二千五百六十元、花邊抽綉業二萬七千八百二十元、旅業第二批一萬七千五百十八元、鐘表業六千七百三十二元、廣吿業五千四百三十五元、針織業三千九百五十元、百貨商店業三干九百元、典業第二批三百六十元、共計九萬八千二百七十七元、</p>
<p>紗業同業公會近組織救國公債勸募紗業分隊、成立以來、各隊昌對於勸募事、莫不踴躍興奮、現繳款認購、並已呈報商界總隊者、計南公茂一萬元、益昌八千元、福泰慶記新號·益大各五千元、振大昌四千元、景豐·同泰昌各三千五百元、新公茂·洪佐堯·寶豐·鑫泰各三千元、萃孚二千元、久康一千五百元、合茂·强茂記．乾亨·朱培記·石東來·永興·永興餘記·榮鑫各一千元等、及千元以下者、共國幣六萬三千餘元、</p>
<p>本市第一特區市民聯合會、以政府發行救國公債、在集中全國財力充實抗戰準備除已协同市民第一特區組、積極勸募外、玆以救國儲金、爲國民人人所應担任、爰於今日起、領導各區分會、向市民進行勸募、第一期擬以二十萬戶為標的、該會全體執監委員、於今晨舉行紀念式後、並各立救國儲金摺一枚、以為市民倡導、</p>
<h3>中外銀行開戶往來</h3>
<p>便利清算兩方票據　彼此同情代理交換</p>
<p>戰事發生以來、滬市金融、以政府措施得法、銀錢業各界協助合作、穩定如常、故外商銀行對華商銀行票據、頗為信任、除成立票據交換所外、並向華商銀行開戶往來、形成委託代理交換、實開上海中外票據交換之新紀錄、新新社記者、分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>外商設票據交換所</p>
<p>外灘銀行、對於票據之收解、一向於彼此送騐後、用大劃條及寄庫辦法清算、並無一定之塲所、但由中國銀行為總匯計其然否、中央·中國·交通·及中國通商等銀行、雖為華商銀行、然以設立於外灘、故亦加入外商銀行公會通大劃條、自戰事發生以來、各銀行奉財部命令、移於安全地帶辦公、已不在外灘、於是各外商銀行、乃放棄其一向所採之大劃條辦法、而每日派人於上午十一時半、在匯豐銀行聚首核對、無形中已成為一種票據交換所、</p>
<p>華洋同情代理交換</p>
<p>外商銀行、對於華商銀行、向無同業存放往來之事、中中交三行、雖加入外灘外商銀行之清算團體、但當日卽用寄庫方法軋清、彼此間無存欠關係、無所謂同業往來、今自戰事發生後、亦破例向我國銀行開立同業往來戶、我方亦向外商銀行開戶、彼此間現有同業往來、則凡我向外灘各行應收票據、不必一一往收、而總存於所往來之洋商銀行、彼此同情、成為一種代理交換、</p>
<p>兩團體電慰王正廷</p>
<p>上海市商會地方協會、昨聯名電慰中國駐美大使王正廷云、王大使儒堂先生鑒、聞友邦同情之聲、足見折衝樽俎之勞、謹致敬慰之意、並祝繼續努力、上海市商會地方協會叩、</p>
<h3>中日貿易協會辦理結束</h3>
<p>去年一二七、周作民等倡設之小日貿易協會、係敷衍日方財界兒玉謙次等所夢想之“中日經濟提携”而成立、一年餘來、除照例酬應外、甚少實際工作、頃我全面抗戰開始、此種應酬團體、早已無設置之必要、故該會已無形解散、昨晨該會某理事向探詢該會狀况之華東社記者解釋、敝會與日方斷絕往來、早在抗戰發動以前、目下理事會正辦理結束、必要時將發表報告、</p>

<h3>滬西童軍救護隊招募新隊員</h3>
<p>并徵求卡車一輛</p>
<p>滬西童軍戰地救護隊、自成立以來、各隊員分向前後方從事救護工作精神極佳、在隊長鄭連坤·陶亞于等領導之下成績斐然、近因鑒於滬西之敎護上極為需要故該隊復於北新涇附近設立分隊、便利工作、現該隊工作頗忙、故欲臨時召新隊員數名、如有志從事救護願為國犧牲者、可至曹家渡保衛團團部滬西童軍救護隊辦事處報名、又該隊現缺乏救護卡車一輛、（司機人汽油由該隊自備）如有熱心人士願意捐助或臨時義務假用者可電話（二零四七三）通知該隊隨即派員前來接洽、</p>
<h3>黃友逢廣播演講中國對日抗戰目的</h3>
<p>為民族求生存為人類扶正氣而戰　不惜竭最後一滴血以求民族出路</p>
<p>前中宣部國際宣傳處處長黃友逢氏、近為暴日侵略我領土、屠殺我人民、特以英文發表長篇文字、在交通部廣播電台對外廣播、宣傳日人橫暴眞相、促起友邦人士注意、文長五六千言、茲節譯其要略如後、</p>
<p>中國自從革命以後、在偉大的領袖領導之下、專心致力於民主國家的建設、以期促進世界安全及商業發展、但是不幸得很、這種努力橫被黷武的日本帝國主義所摧殘、並且蒙蔽世界各國人民的視聽、現在總算是在層雲濃霧之中、露出一綫光明、我們求生存的抵抗、已引起全世界的同情和注意了、</p>
<p>我們相信黷武的民族必將覆亡、野蠻民族、必將進化、但是絕料不到一個已有充足的實業而且自命不凡的文明國家、竟回復到野蠻時代、在日本人的意思、好像“生存”這個名詞不合用於中國人民、倘使日本得遂行其瘋狂的軍國主義、則地球將暗無天日、全人類均不免呻吟於共槍尖之下、</p>
<p>從前日本大隈內閣時代、卽會對中國提出二十一條要求、欲以武力造成他在中國獨佔的地位、現在日本在平津及上海的軍事行動、卽為實行其預定計劃之結果、日本要征服中國使成為高麗第二、早已是全世界所周知的了、此種企圖至田中內閣而格外顯著、彼著名的田中奏摺、卽明言日本先要支配滿蒙、再進而把振中國資源、以為實現統制全球的基礎、日本的言行、從來不相符合、此種事例、舉不勝舉、當其以武力佔據中國邊疆之時、卽揚言對華收取和平步驟、但是事實上則實得其反、武力之壓迫更甚、今則不但毁壞中國軍事要區、並且又隨意濫炸首都及其他城市、紅十字救護隊·醫院·文化·及敎育機關·無辜的非戰鬥員及難民、皆被其害、卽我友邦英國大使、亦不幸而遭其襲擊、縱然日本在各國善於利用宣傳手段、但是這些鐵一般的事實放在面前、雖有巧辯亦難逃公論、</p>
<p>日本近衛首相在八月二十八日宣稱、“目前形勢、不能使用外交方式、日本必須打得中國屈膝、俾其以後不再有作戰的企想、”這種傲慢的言論、有無價值、不必多講、事實勝於雄辯、轟炸是否可以嚇退中國人民的反抗、大概近衛不久就可明白了、事實上日本之橫暴愈甚、而其自身的毁滅亦愈快、中國早已凖備應付此種突然的事變、無論其恐怖威力大至如何程度、找們固然不輕易放棄和平、但到了和平眞正絕望的時候、亦絕不惜竭最後一滴血、以求民族的生路、</p>
<p>日本在中國的行動、早已形成眞實的戰爭、一切國聯的公約·九國公約·以及非戰公約等均被撕毁、而各簽約國的威信亦都被綁上法塲了、除非國際的良心依然被日本軍閥所蒙蔽、則現在將無有一事更重要於制裁日本的侵略、</p>
<p>八年前美國對蘇聯曾經發過銳利的要求、請其解釋在北滿的行動、現在日本不但如此、並且在現代歷史上產生最大的侵略戰爭了、中國人民對美之信任甚深、因為美國人民向來是維持正義的、美國旣以其誠信建立了非戰公約及九國公約、現在必能仗義執言、聯合各國實行對日經濟抵制、這是停止日本軍閥黷武、並且避免世界戰爭的唯一方法、</p>
<h3>劉汝明對中央表示感奮</h3>

<p>照常地砲擊、照常地轟炸蘊藻浜兩岸敵我的陣地、是一天比一天逼近了、而猛烈的血戰、更在闡北和劉行方面不斷地進行、這裹的高級長官們、雖然在短短的祇有四五小時的睡眠時間中、還時刻地給電話鈴聲所攪擾着、面精神却依然十分飽滿和壯健、聽說敵機常在我們陣地的上空散發日文報紙、這些報紙上面滿載着“皇軍”勝利的消息、正如囈語夢語、因爲“皇軍”的勝敗、我們前綫的健兒是挺清楚不過的、常常在這些報紙上面、所載着的“皇軍”佔領的地方、也就是我們前綫的健兒所扼守的地方、</p>
<p>在沉寂的黑暗的晚上、聽到機關砲連續地響着、探海燈强烈地照着、我們知道我們的空軍、正在浦江的上空活躍、大家默默地遙遠地望着、心中含着無限的興奮和愉快、</p>
<p>十月六日</p>
<p>今天劉行方面頗為沉寂、閘北的劇戰還在繼續地進行、而更激烈的戰事、却在蕰藻　的沿岸展開、我們在蕰藻浜南岸的陣地之受攻擊、是早在預料之中、我們時刻都在等待着、現在呢、我們等待着的衝殺的時間已經到了、我相信我們前綫的弟兄們都是很高興的、</p>
<p>在蘊藻浜的北岸前昨兩日都有着敵人的擊留汽球上升在空中、這汽球顯然已經完成了偵察的任務、所以在今天、敵人接着便在砲火掩護之下實行强渡了、但是直到現在、我們忠勇的士兵、冒着密集的砲火、經過整日不斷的衝擊、已經給予了敵人以重大的創傷、眞是渡河又有何用、昨天在閘北被我們俘虜的敵軍士兵加籐佐一、今天解到了這裹、他默默地坐在屋角裹、滿臉粗黑的鬍子、掩不了兩頰成了紫色的血痕、懊喪地垂着沉重的頭、正在記掛他遙遠的愛妻和老母，他呢、直到做了俘虜、還不知道為什麼要和中國打仗、可憐的日本的士兵、可憐的日本的國民、</p>
<p>在搖曳的燭光之下、我又默默地想着蘊藻浜渡河的敵人的命運、是戰死還是和加藤同樣的做了俘虜、</p>
<p>十月七日</p>
<p>蕰藻浜沿岸的戰事、還在激烈地進行、雖然大雨不斷地下着、我們前綫的將士、還在繼續地消滅渡河的敵人、和阻止敵人的繼續渡河、天雨固然在作戰上發生困難、但是遇去三十六小時不斷的血戰、我們顯然佔着絕對的優勢、據諜報、東京方面對於上海的戰事、限令於十月十日之前、攻佔淞滬一帶、十月十日是我們的國慶日、我們現在正踏着先烈的血跡、和敵人搏鬥、為着生存獨立和自由、十月十日距離今天祇有短短的兩天、敵人的企圖、顯然已經成了白日的夢幻、</p>
<p>寄語全國的同胞、過了兩天之後、我們的雙十節便到臨了、大家忘記了目前的慘痛、例外地歡樂一下吧、一方面是慶祝我們的國慶、一方面是預祝最後的勝利、</p>
<p>十月八日</p>
<p>昨天晚上、在一個偶然的機會中到了上海、而現在又已經回到了這裹、充滿了歌舞昇平的氣象的上海、看了眞有些刺目和異樣、雖然我離開了上海祇有短短的十天、</p>
<p>回到這裹的第一件事、便是問着今天的戰况、知道蘊藻浜沿岸的激戰、還在繼續地進行、而惡戰更將於黑夜中展開、今天我們除了擊沉敵船多艘和斃敵無算外、還俘虜了三個、</p>
<p>雨絲雖然不斷地打着、而敵機還照常在閘北活動、</p>

<p>浦東我軍砲隊、昨晚又發揮威力、向浦江敵艦、猛加轟擊、我軍瞄射準確、敵艦二艘、當被我砲擊中、負傷頗重、但以甲板未曾擊穿、故尚能移動、當卽向下游逃駛而去、今日淸晨雨霽、敵機在浦東我軍上空、盤旋偵察昨晚找軍之砲位、遍覓不得、八時起、我軍砲隊又向浦江發砲、所發之砲、為數不多、擊中敵艦及虹口陣地數處、</p>

<h3>某外人來滬談偽滿各處起義</h3>

<h3>我砲隊神技擊中東洋大樓</h3>
<p>日人倉皇失措異常狼狽</p>
<p>上星期五之深夜十二時餘、我敵雙方、曾作猛烈之跑戰、當時我右翼方面之砲兵曾發一砲、適中於𨳐行路東洋大樓六七樓之中間洋台上、受堅厚墻壁所阻、不能射入、僅將墻炸成一洞、然該處所居之日籍捕頭等、巳魂飛魄散、事後經記者調査得該東洋大樓為新式八層大厦、其後面相隔一馬路卽屬日本俱樂部、當時我方砲兵之目標、乃在於該俱樂部、故其砲彈之射程、由空飛至東洋大樓時、巳直向下趨、若無東洋人樓阻隔、則日本俱樂部必受重大創傷、惟我方砲兵標的奇凖、雖未能適中鵠的、然巳足使敵人心膽俱裂、因當時我砲彈在東洋大樓爆炸、居於該樓之日人、咸急避至底層、一種倉皇失措之情形、令人殊堪發笑、</p>

<h3>杜絕敵貨來源</h3>
<p>各界聯合組織糾察機關嚴査　同時厲行領事簽證方能收效</p>
<p>新新社云、據海關間統計、八月份日輸入為八．四二○·七五○元、輸往日本國貨為四·二六○·一二八元、貿易數字、雖較前减少、但仍維持正常貿易關係、故各界均認為際茲全面抗戰開始之時此種貿易關係、實有立即斷絕之必要、否則不管直接資長敵人侵略力量、新新社記者今晨曾訪晤國貨界某鉅子、叩詢如何杜絕仇貨意見、摅談、中日邦交、因種種關係、雖戰爭巳歷兩月、尚末斷絕、致一般不明國家民族利害商民、仍與日商暗中貿易、以圖－己之利、實屬喪心病狂、若欲杜絕來源、則非照過去之抵制檢査辦法、所能收效、因現被敵人控制區域、北方有河北及察晋等處、上海有楊樹浦區域、敵商货運來、旣不受海關檢査、遂籍其軍事力量、利用漢奸為其運銷、並將貨品商標改頭換面、以淆亂購者之辨別、故杜絕敵貨來源、最有效辦法、必須由海關切實厲行領事簽證、凡商貨進口不論何國貨品、必須呈騐起運地之領事簽證單、一面再由各工商團體聯合組織糾察機關、自動嚴密檢査、則敵貨庶可絕跡、奸商亦無從施其狡計矣、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>自從滬戰發生以來。報上訂婚結婚的廣告。每天有十餘家之多。昨天雙十節。更見精彩表現。訂婚結婚的廣告。竟有三十餘家。熱閙甚矣。故我的朋友説。此次敵人對我用兵。至少有兩種好的現象。一是促成民族的團結。一是促成家庭的團結。這原是一句妙論。在此砲火聲中。而訂婚結婚格外忙。天然有他們忙的道理。我不加以反對。古人有國難未已。何以家爲的高調。我不來爲若輩唱。我祗望他們勿忘前敵奮勇肉搏的將士。和後方困苦劍傷難民與士兵。省一些結婚的金錢。作報國的義舉。</p>

<h3>National Day: Our Troops' Morale Soars, Switching to Offensive, Advances Made on All Fronts</h3>
<p>Enemies Attacking Guangfu Town Driven Back to Near the Highway; Enemies in Wenzaobang Surrounded, Soon to be Annihilated; Fierce Fighting in Zhabei, Our Side Victorious in Every Stage Throughout the Day</p>
<p>The Enemy's Fourth General Offensive Clearly Suffered a Severe Blow. For Ten Days, From Shixianggong Temple in the North, East of Guangfu Town, Both Banks of the Wenzaobang River, to Jiangwan and Zhabei in the South, the Enemy Repeatedly Launched Fierce Attacks, But Made No Progress. Yesterday, Though Enemy Troops on Both Banks of the Wenzaobang River Continued to Struggle, the So-Called General Offensive Was Actually Coming to an End. Yesterday, Despite the Rain, the Central News Agency Correspondent with the Troops Visited the Various Frontline Units and Learned That Our Army Had Begun to Switch from Defense to Offense Yesterday. For the Past Three Days, the Fighting Has Been Quite Fierce on Both Banks Centered on the Wenzaobang River. The Enemy's Attack on Xiliufangzhai Has Been Repelled, and a Unit Attacking Guangfu Town Has Been Pursued Step by Step by Our Troops and Driven to Near the Shanghai-Tai Highway, and Many Important Strongholds Have Been Recaptured. As for the Unit That Crossed the Wenzaobang River, a Large Portion of It Has Been Annihilated in Our Counterattack. The Remaining Enemy Troops, Numbering About Two Thousand, Are Trapped Along the Riverbank, But Have No Stronghold, and Are Surrounded by Us. Yesterday Afternoon, We Forced Them to Surrender Their Weapons, But the Remaining Enemy Troops Were Stubborn, and Our Troops Punished Them Severely and Will Soon Resolve the Situation Completely. Also, the Enemy Holed Up in the Wenzaobang River Station Seemed to Be Moving Westward. In Order to Preemptively Strike, We Also Launched a Sudden Attack from the Miaohang Area. The Enemy Was Caught Off Guard and Suffered Heavy Losses. At This Moment, Amidst the Enthusiastic National Day Celebrations, Our Loyal and Brave Soldiers Displayed Their Divine Might and Severely Wounded the Enemy, Further Increasing Our Confidence in Winning the Final Victory.</p>
<p>The Enemy Troops Claimed They Could Break Through Our Lines by October 15 and Force Our Troops to Retreat to the Jiading-Nanxiang Line. Therefore, After the Start of the Fourth General Offensive, They First Broke Through Our Shanghai-Tai Highway Line at Taipingqiao Baojianong, and Then Constantly Attacked Our Guangfu and Shixianggong Temple with Heavy Troops. However, After Our Valiant Resistance, They Suffered a Severe Blow, and Changed Their Target. On the Third of This Month, They Used Illegal Weapons Such as Poison Gas to Force a Crossing of the Wenzaobang River, Thinking They Could Then Drive Straight In. The Enemy Also Claimed That They Could Achieve Their Goal by October 10. Unexpectedly, They Were Met With a Fierce Counterattack From Our Troops, and Lost Their Bearing. It Is a Pity That the Continuous Rain Has Caused Water to Accumulate in the Fields, Hindering Our Troops' Movements, So We Have Not Been Able to Sweep Away and Eliminate the Enemy Sooner. After Repelling the Enemy on the Frontal Positions of Guangfu Town, the Enemy Has Moved Southward. Therefore, Since the Ninth, the Fighting in That Area Has Been Less Intense Than Before. However, the Fighting Between Tangqiao Station and Lujiaxiang on the North Bank of the Yunzaobang River Has Gradually Become More Intense. Although Several Points on Our Warning Line Southwest of Tangqiao Have Been Breached by the Enemy, We Have Transferred Fresh Troops to Encircle and Vigorously Attack the Enemy. The Enemy's Attempt to Coordinate With the Black Dahwangzhai Unit on the South Bank Will Surely Fail.</p>
<p>On the Positions North of Luodian Caowang Temple, the Enemy Troops Again Used Poison Gas to Attack Us. Dozens of Our Soldiers Were Poisoned, Becoming Unconscious and Vomiting. However, Our Troops' Positions Are Still Extremely Solid and Have Not Changed at All, Sufficient to Cope With Everything With Ease.</p>
<h3>Counterattacking the 63rd Garden, Our Troops Engaged in Bloody Melee Combat With the Enemy</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Also Reported in Zhabei</p>
<p>The Central News Agency Correspondent Reported at 1 AM on the 11th: Yesterday Morning, Our Three Routes of Counterattack in the Jiangwan Area Repelled the Enemy Attacking From the 63rd Garden Area. Later, We Took Advantage of the Victory to Search and Advance. There Was No Sign of the Enemy on Tongli Road. Then, as the Rain Poured Down, Hindering Movement, We Did Not Press the Attack on the Enemy's Nest. At About 7 PM, As the Rain Subsided Slightly, We Immediately Launched a Two-Pronged Attack, Still Advancing Along the West Line of the Henghang River and Tongli Road Towards the 63rd Garden. At the Same Time, The Zhizhi University Also Launched a Feigned Attack on the Enemy Positions at the Patriotic Girls' School to Tie Down Their Forces. The Vanguards Met at the Intersection of Tongli Road and Immediately Exchanged Machine Gun Fire. Although the Enemy Marine Corps Headquarters' Artillery Fire Was Fierce, We Still Pressed Forward Stage by Stage. After an Hour and a Half of Fierce Fighting, Our Troops Launched a Violent Charge and Engaged the Enemy in Hand-to-Hand Combat. As of the Report, They Were Still Engaged in Bloody Battle. Also, the Enemy on North Sichuan Road, At About 8 PM, Launched an Attack From Guangdong Street Qiujiang Road and Dongbaoxing Road With a Company-Sized Force. This Move By the Enemy Seemed to Be Aimed at Tying Down Our Forces Counterattacking the Baziqiao Area. However, We Had Made Preparations Early. When the Enemy Charged Close, We Courageously Met Them in Battle. After An Hour of Fierce Fighting, We Killed More Than 30 Enemy Soldiers to Blunt Their Attack. Then, According to Intelligence Reports, Enemy Tanks on North Sichuan Road Were Moving Abnormally, Seeming to Have Other Intentions. But As of the Report, the Enemy and We Were Locked in Standoff and There Were No Changes.</p>
<h3>Continuing the Spirit of the Martyrs, Our Soldiers Bravely Kill the Enemy</h3>
<p>Pudong Artillery Displays Might, Inflicts Heavy Damage on the Enemy</p>
<p>Yesterday Was National Day Commemoration Day. Our Frontline Soldiers Fighting Against the Japanese Continued the Difficult Spirit of the Martyrs Who Founded the Republic of China, Bravely Charged and Killed, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy. Our Valiant Air Force Was Unable to Come to Shanghai Yesterday Due to the All-Day Heavy Rain. In Addition to the Tragic and Enthusiastic Commemoration Ceremony, the Entire City of Shanghai Was Unusually Quiet All Day in the Bitter Wind and Drizzling Rain. However, At 8 PM, Our Pudong Artillery Suddenly Broke Through the Dull Air Over the Huangpu River, and Heavily Bombed the Yangshupu Area With Heavy Shells. The Enemy Was Panic-Stricken and Retaliated From Warships. The Heavy Bombardment Continued Until 11 PM, and Giant Explosions Could Be Heard in the Eastern District, Likely From Our Heavy Artillery Hitting the Enemy's Positions and Displaying Its Power. At That Time, The Enemy Naval Pier Caught Fire Immediately, and the Lao Sanjing Pier in Yangjing District, Pudong Also Caught Fire at the Same Time. The Bombardment Ceased at Midnight.</p>
<h3>Zhabei: Our Troops Encircle and Repel the Enemy</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency Correspondent Reported at 1:30 PM on the 10th: Last Night (the 9th), the Enemy in the 63rd Garden Area Launched an Attack on Our Baziqiao Area. We Flanked the Enemy From Fangjiamuqiao Along the Henghang River and Liuying Road. At the Same Time, Our Guangdong Middle School Also Sent a Team to Attack the Side of the 63rd Garden From Tongli Road. Seeing That the Situation Was Unfavorable, the Enemy Immediately Transferred About Two Companies From the Patriotic Girls' School to Assist in Harassing Us. Our Troops Were Well Connected on All Three Sides, and Launched Multiple Attacks. After Four Hours of Fierce Fighting in Heavy Rain, We Killed About 70 Enemy Soldiers, Including One Company Commander. By About 4 AM This Morning (the 10th), the Enemy's Morale Was Exhausted, and They Fled Towards the 63rd Garden and the Patriotic Girls' School.</p>
<h3>Annihilated Over 70 Enemy Soldiers on Guangdong Street</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency Correspondent Reported at 12:30 PM on the 10th: At 3:30 AM This Morning (the 10th), About Two Companies of Enemy Troops on North Sichuan Road, Under the Cover of Tanks, Again Attacked Guangdong Street. Although the Enemy's Artillery Fire Was Very Fierce, After Our Head-On Heavy Blow, After About Three Hours of Street Fighting, Over 70 Enemy Soldiers Were Annihilated. The Enemy Then Retreated. According to Intelligence Reports, The Enemy Has Repeatedly Attacked Our Zhabei and Jiangwan and Other Places, But Has Not Succeeded. They Are Now Digging Tunnels in Order to Bomb Our Fortifications. However, We Have Strict Precautions, and The Enemy's Attempt Will Definitely Fail.</p>

Chiang wore a special grade of general's dress uniform, appearing vigorous and radiant. Ambassadors and consuls from various countries stationed in Nanjing, including England, America, France, Germany, Russia, and the Netherlands, extended their congratulations to our government in the morning. The Bureau of Ceremonies dispatched personnel to receive and express gratitude. (Tenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Party Headquarters held a National Day commemoration meeting this morning. Attendees included Central Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Zhaoming, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Wang Chonghui, Ye Chucang, Bai Chongxi, He Yingqin, Zhang Ji, Jiang Zuobin, Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, Chen Gongbo, Wu Zhongxin, Gu Zhenglun, Zhang Daofan, Cheng Tiangu, Chen Shaokuan, Duan Xipeng, Peng Xuepei, Chen Shuren, Gan Naiguang, Ma Chaojun, Zhang Lisheng, Zeng Zhongming, Qian Dajun, Jiao Yitang, Wang Yongbin, Gu Zhenggang, Xu Kan, Gu Zhengding, Liu Jiwen, Mao Zuquan, Wang Bingjun, Mei Gongren, Liang Hancao, Di Ying, Wen Yiyou, Wang Maogong, Chen Bijun, Zhang Zhen, Wang Shufang, Zeng Kuoqing, Hong Lanyou, Xiong Kewu, and Luo Yiqun, Hu Wenshuo and more than fifty others. Chairman Wang presided over the meeting and delivered a report. The meeting adjourned at approximately one o'clock. The report is recorded as follows: Today is the 26th National Day of the Republic of China. The greatest significance of this National Day is that the second half of the National Revolution has now begun. Its purpose is to fight for the survival of the Republic of China, and to fight for the freedom and equality of the Republic of China. This struggle is manifested in resisting Japanese aggression and overthrowing Japanese aggressionism. The first half of the National Revolution, according to the necessary stages, was a difficult struggle for domestic unification. Now we can say that, as a result of the struggle, unification has been achieved. From now on, we no longer need to expend effort on internal matters. Every drop of blood and every penny from our compatriots and comrades will be used to resist Japanese aggression and overthrow Japanese aggressionism. Our entire nation is determined that everyone must sacrifice and resist everywhere. We take the entire regiment's martyrdom in Nankou and the entire battalion's martyrdom in Baoshan as examples. We know that the armed comrades in Shanghai are continuing to advance along these bloody footprints. Because of this, from August 13th until today, the enemy, with all its land, sea, and air forces, even if it has broken through one of our points, has ultimately been unable to affect our entire line. Moreover, that one point is still being lost and regained, retreating and advancing. The ability of the Shanghai battle to last so long is by no means accidental. On the Shanxi front, although Datong suffered a defeat, because they were able to acknowledge the defeat, bear the responsibility for the defeat, and strive to salvage the situation, the morale of the army and the people can still be roused and stand firm. We hope that the Pinghan and Jinpu fronts can do the same. In short, we must be determined that everyone must sacrifice and resist everywhere. This is the factor for endurance, and also the factor for final victory. Japan's aggression and our resistance have aroused the condemnation of Japan by various countries, as well as their sympathy and assistance for us. Not only the government, but also the enthusiastic expressions of various civil society organizations are particularly inspiring to us. At the same time, we know that Japan will therefore use even more brutal means to intensify its attacks on us, in order to create the so-called fait accompli that it dreams of. Therefore, from today onwards, we must make every possible effort to strengthen our resistance, so that the sympathy and assistance of various countries can be further advanced to jointly remove the greatest obstacles to human justice. Today is National Day. We unanimously shout to resist Japanese aggression, overthrow Japanese aggressionism, safeguard the survival of the Republic of China, promote the realization of freedom and equality in the Republic of China, and promote the realization of world peace. Long live freedom and equality in the Republic of China, long live world peace. (Tenth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government held a National Day commemoration meeting in Nanjing on the tenth. At six o'clock in the morning, the national flag with the blue sky and white sun was raised amidst the sound of music, soaring proudly in the sky, a scene of solemnity and dignity, fully expressing the spirit of our resistance. The meeting began at seven o'clock sharp. Central figures attending included Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, Dai Jitao, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, Zhang Ji, Chen Shuren, Bai Chongxi, Zhu Qinglan, He Yingqin, Jiang Zuobin, Wang Shijie, Chen Shaokuan, Wang Yongbin, Lin Yunhai, Jing Hengyi, Yu Feipeng, Wang Boqun, Ma Chaojun, and all staff members of the three departments of civil service, military affairs, and accounting, totaling more than four hundred people. Chairman Chiang wore a military uniform and sword, appearing radiant. Chairman Lin wore a black cloak, with a dignified demeanor. After performing the rituals, Chairman Lin delivered a report, with the speech promoting the raising of comfort funds for the resistance soldiers and cotton-padded clothes for wounded soldiers and refugees. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Today is the Double Tenth Festival, the National Day of the birth of the Republic of China. In principle, we should be rejoicing and celebrating enthusiastically on this day every year. However, this year's Double Tenth Festival finds many places and many compatriots across the country threatened by Japanese aircraft bombs and artillery fire. Frontline soldiers, fighting for national independence and ethnic survival, are engaged in a desperate battle with the enemy. Today, we should use the spirit and enthusiasm of rejoicing and enthusiastic celebration from previous years to comfort our loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers across the country, and to provide relief to wounded soldiers and refugees in various places. We must understand that this war of resistance is related to the life and death of the entire nation and the entire ethnic group. If we win the war of resistance, the Chinese nation will have hope of revival from now on. Otherwise, the future of our country will be unimaginable. Therefore, today, we should gather the intelligence, physical strength, material resources, and financial resources of compatriots across the country to resist this unprecedented foreign invasion and to safeguard the survival and independence of our nation. The so-called comprehensive war of resistance means not only that the armies in various parts of the country are fighting at the same time, but also that people from all walks of life in various parts of the country are participating in the work of the war of resistance at the same time. Those with strength contribute strength, those with wealth contribute wealth, or contribute to the country with their intelligence and talent, or donate their industries and goods for military use. Educators strive to popularize education, and the industrial sector strives to increase production. The entire country, from young to old, men and women, everyone fulfills their responsibility and does their part. This is in line with the true meaning of comprehensive war of resistance, and it is a true national mobilization. The ancients had a saying: "The rise and fall of a country is the responsibility of every individual." This means that when the country is invaded by foreign enemies, everyone should assume the responsibility of resisting the enemy and saving the country. Now is the time for our country to implement a comprehensive war of resistance against the enemy invading our territory. Because of our duties or other reasons, we cannot personally participate in frontline combat, so we should do our best to support the frontline battles, and do as much spiritual or material help as possible for the loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers across the country. Therefore, on this National Day of the birth of the Republic of China, we use the spirit and enthusiasm of rejoicing and enthusiastic celebration from previous years to comfort our loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers across the country, and to express our infinite love and respect to our loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers across the country. On the one hand, it has great significance, and on the other hand, it is indeed the duty and responsibility of all our compatriots in the rear. We hope that compatriots across the country will unite from today onwards to carry out a large-scale comfort movement, raise a large amount of comfort funds, and continue to provide spiritual comfort and material assistance to our loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers across the country, so that our loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers across the country will increase their courage to resist the war, drive out strong enemies for the country, and win glory for the nation. We must know that for every point of courage the frontline soldiers increase in resisting the war, our country will increase one point of strength in resisting the enemy. And in order for our frontline soldiers to continue to increase their courage to resist the war, it all depends on the ability of our compatriots in the rear to continue to do more to help with the war of resistance. Therefore, it is indeed an indispensable and important task for our country at present that compatriots across the country unite today to carry out a large-scale comfort movement and raise a large amount of comfort funds. At the same time, the wounded soldiers in various places are all loyal and brave warriors sent back from the front lines, and the refugees in various places are compatriots who have been displaced by the threat of enemy aircraft and artillery. We should also give them spiritual comfort and material relief at the same time. Winter is approaching and the weather is gradually getting colder. When compatriots across the country raise comfort funds for the frontline soldiers, they should also raise a large number of cotton-padded clothes for the wounded soldiers and refugees in various places to meet the needs of the wounded soldiers and refugees in various places for protection from the cold in winter. This is also the responsibility and work that all our compatriots in the rear should fulfill, and it is a responsibility that must be fulfilled and work that must be done. In short, at this time, our country should fully demonstrate the spirit of comprehensive war of resistance. The 400 million compatriots across the country should each fulfill a responsibility and each do a part in the war of resistance. Those on the front lines fulfill the responsibilities of the front lines, and those in the rear fulfill the responsibilities of the rear. The entire country is united, and all the people are of one heart. There should not be the slightest slackness at any time. If we can do this, we believe that the final victory of the war of resistance will definitely belong to us. Today is the National Day of the birth of the Republic of China. We hope that in the near future, another National Day for the victory of the war of resistance will be produced. We hope that compatriots across the country will encourage each other and work together. (Tenth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

The discipline was solemn. Liu, armed, appeared on the review platform and gave a speech to the military training students, which lasted for two hours. (Tenth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Cruiser Officers Arrive in Hong Kong from Hankou</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou] The train carrying officers from the British warship HMS Gannet, originally scheduled to pass through Guangzhou at around 3:00 PM on the 29th, was delayed until 5:30 PM due to an air raid alert in Guangzhou. The train stopped briefly at the Shipai Station on the eastern outskirts of Guangzhou and received greetings from British expatriate officials and civilians, then proceeded directly to Hong Kong via the Kowloon-Canton Railway. A reporter boarded the train at Shipai for an interview. According to them, the train departed from Wuchang on the 6th and traveled south, arriving safely along the way. However, upon reaching Hengyang, it was heard that Japanese planes had bombed the station after the train departed from Zhuzhou. After entering Guangdong, the train was delayed due to bombing damage to the tracks in many places. On the 8th, as the train approached Yingde, 13 Japanese planes were seen approaching head-on. The train stopped immediately, and shortly thereafter a loud explosion was heard. It was later learned that several bombs had fallen approximately one mile in front of the train. Before long, more bomb sounds were heard. It was then reported that a bridge approximately three miles in front of the train had also been bombed, causing us to be stranded in Yingde for more than ten hours. The difficulty of this trip was truly unexpected. The British authorities had formally notified Tokyo and the Japanese military commander in Shanghai before the train was scheduled to depart. Fortunately, thanks to the goodwill and perseverance of the Chinese railway authorities, the HMS Gannet train, which is memorable in history, was finally able to safely reach its destination. We are deeply grateful and deeply admire the Chinese railway workers. As for the bombing damage along the way, we have all witnessed it and it is deeply imprinted in our minds.

<h3>Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Legal Tender Conversion of Gold</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance recently formulated detailed rules for the implementation of the legal tender conversion of gold, which were announced on the tenth by ministerial order. At the same time, it was telegraphed to the provincial and municipal governments to urge strict supervision and earnest implementation. The details of the item are recorded below: (1) Military and police agencies should protect those who carry gold to the conversion agencies for conversion and should not obstruct them. Except for private smuggling of gold for export and private carrying of gold in coastal areas with the intention of smuggling it for export, which is found by the customs, it will still be handled in accordance with the general case of prohibiting gold exports. The method of the Ministry of Finance that had been previously set for transporting raw gold in the interior to obtain a certificate from the chamber of commerce at the place of departure, should be stopped. (2) The daily posted market price of pure gold at the Central Bank should be telegraphed to the branches of the four banks of the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural banks in various provinces, and copied to the post offices or postal savings and remittance bureaus at all levels, and other entrusted agencies, and posted on the door for public announcement. For places where transportation is inconvenient and telegrams arrive late, the exchange rate should be based on the last reported market price received. (3) The calculation of the weight of gold should be based on the standard new metric system and should not follow the custom of using the old balance. (4) If the conversion agency does not have the appropriate personnel to estimate the fineness of the gold, it may select a public appraiser to handle it locally, ensuring fairness and accuracy, and not raising or lowering the price. (5) The conversion agency should post the method for converting gold into legal tender at the entrance of the agency or in a prominent place. (6) The conversion agency should provide full convenience for those who request to convert gold into legal tender or convert it as a legal tender deposit in accordance with the provisions of the gold conversion method, and complete the procedures in the shortest possible time. (7) The conversion agency should sincerely receive people who request to convert gold, regardless of the amount, and should not delay or treat them lightly. (8) The conversion agency should report the converted gold every ten days and send it to the competent agency for review by the Ministry of Finance. (9) The conversion agency may use 1% of the amount of gold converted as a handling fee for estimation, weighing, and transportation. The aforementioned handling fee shall be borne by the Ministry of Finance. (10) The Ministry of Finance will issue certificates of commendation to conversion agencies that have achieved excellent results in collecting gold to encourage them. (11) These detailed rules shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. (Tenth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Pays Attention to Relief Work</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan instructed the provincial and municipal governments that as the war zone is expanding and the number of refugees is increasing, it is imperative to take in and appease them. All our countrymen should rise up together. It is hoped that local governments at all levels will gather manpower and financial resources to jointly plan and implement the work. No penny of the funds for relief work should be wasted. (Tenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Since our country's war of resistance, foreign friends have been extremely concerned about the relief of our wounded and dead people. In the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, in addition to Shanghai, there are still more than 120 American doctors, nurses, and missionaries engaged in refugee relief work in the original places. Their families have been sent to Manila for temporary residence. At present, overseas Chinese in the United States are training for relief work and are preparing to return home to serve in the front lines in the near future. In Singapore and other parts of Southeast Asia, our country's medical personnel have been returning to the country one after another to participate in frontline work. (Tenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Enemy Attempts to Break Through Fail, Our Left Flank is as Solid as Gold</h3>
<p>Enemy Conspiracy Fails After Fierce Fighting for Ten Days, Battalion Commander Lei's Entire Battalion Dies at Xu Residence Positions, Enemy Resorts to Using Poison Gas Due to Lack of Opportunities</p>
<p>On our left flank, the enemy has repeatedly launched fierce attacks in recent days, but all have been bravely repelled by our army. A Central News Agency reporter visited the war zone and inquired with a senior staff officer in charge of commanding the area about the latest combat situation as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy's Attempt Has Become a Fantasy</p>
<p>Based on the recent situation of the enemy's repeated general attacks on our left flank, and what can be inferred from various documents obtained from the enemy, the enemy intends to realize its plan for a central breakthrough before the Double Tenth Festival, seize our two locations of Nanxiang and Jiading, and force the withdrawal of our troops stationed in the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas without fighting. However, our side has noticed the enemy's attempt, so we have also taken strict precautions for the military in that area, strengthened our strength, and strengthened our fortifications. Although the enemy is stubborn, they will not succeed in the end, and now the enemy's attempt has become a fantasy.</p>
<p>Heroic Sacrifice at Xu Residence Positions</p>
<p>Our side is fighting with high morale, and everyone is determined to live and die with the positions. At the beginning of this month, the enemy launched several fierce attacks on our Xu Residence positions. Our battalion commander Lei Hanchi, who was stationed there, led his brave soldiers and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, but our side also suffered heavy casualties. However, enemy reinforcements kept coming. Our battalion commander Lei stubbornly defended the positions and never retreated. The enemy surrounded our section of the positions. Our battalion commander Lei raised his arms and shouted, and the loyal and brave warriors bravely rushed out of the trenches and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Enemy corpses were strewn everywhere, but because we were outnumbered, all the soldiers and the positions were lost, and our battalion commander Lei also died there. This admirable and touching spirit is enough to be a model for all ages.</p>
<p>Enemy Barbarously Uses Poison Gas</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, a large enemy team invaded our positions near Shi Xianggong Temple, including Jinjia Residence, Lu Residence, and Bei Zhou Residence. Although the enemy's firepower was extremely fierce, our army responded calmly. The enemy was only wasting bullets. The enemy recklessly charged into our positions, and our army surrounded and attacked them. The enemy was in a panic and fled in defeat, abandoning many spoils of war. The enemy was so enraged that it disregarded everything and released sneezing gas bombs in the faint light of dawn the next day. A portion of our army was unprepared and fell into a state of confusion. The enemy's inhumanity can be seen from this.</p>

<h3>The Road to Victory</h3>
<p>— Hu Yuzhi</p>
<p>The Republic of China has existed for twenty-six years, but this is the first time the entire nation has engaged in a war against a foreign enemy. Naturally, we also participated in World War I, but as everyone knows, China's participation was merely nominal; at most, we followed the Allied powers, waving flags and shouting slogans. A genuine war against a foreign enemy has never before occurred in the history of the Republic.</p>
<p>A genuine war against a foreign enemy is a war between countries. The enemy uses the power of their entire nation to invade and slaughter us. Naturally, we can only use the power of our entire nation to defend ourselves.</p>
<p>The phrase "the power of the entire nation" should be given special emphasis. During the Qing dynasty, we experienced many wars against foreign enemies, including the Opium War, the Sino-French War, the Sino-Russian War, and the First Sino-Japanese War. But the results we obtained were only compromise, submission, ceding territory, and paying indemnities. This was because during the Qing dynasty, we did not use the power of the entire nation to engage in resistance against foreign enemies, and it was also impossible to use the power of the entire nation to engage in resistance against foreign enemies. Originally, the "nation" at that time was the "nation" privately owned by the Qing imperial family, and not the "nation" jointly owned by the 400 million people. The Qing dynasty minister Gangyi had a saying: "Rather give it to neighboring friends than hand it over to household slaves." The Qing imperial edicts even advocated "measuring the material resources of China to win the favor of friendly nations." Under such political conditions, it was absolutely impossible to mobilize the power of the entire nation to resist foreign enemies.</p>
<p>The policy of "rather give it to neighboring friends than hand it over to household slaves" ultimately led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty's three-hundred-year rule. After the Xinhai Revolution, the "nation" became a nation jointly owned by 400 million people, and no longer the private property of a small number of people. However, because the Republic had not experienced a genuine war against a foreign enemy since its establishment, people did not genuinely feel the need for the "nation" or the preciousness of the "nation" until recently. After the Xinhai Revolution, we spent twenty-five whole years engaged in internal conflicts. It was not until the Japanese invaders occupied one-third of China's territory, and after six years of national crisis, that we awakened and united as a nation to resist foreign enemies. This is something we should not avoid mentioning.</p>
<p>There is currently an argument circulating not only abroad but also believed by some people within the country, which states: "A country can only be strong externally if it implements autocracy and dictatorship internally; democracy has no power externally." Hitler advocated this, Mussolini advocated this, and the Japanese militarists also advocated this. There is nothing wrong with this, because in fascist aggressor countries, the people oppose war, so to engage in foreign aggression, it is first necessary to implement autocracy and dictatorship internally. But in peace-loving countries and countries being invaded, it is exactly the opposite. In countries being invaded, the people are willing to defend their country and fight, and what they oppose is only surrendering to foreign enemies. Therefore, only democracy can increase the power of resistance against foreign enemies. The result of autocracy and dictatorship is only to weaken the power of the country. The policies of the late Qing dynasty are an example.</p>
<p>A country being invaded, to resist a powerful enemy, needs two essential conditions: unity and democracy. And these two conditions are inseparable. Without unity, there is no democracy; without democracy, unity cannot be consolidated.</p>
<p>Now, unity has already become a reality. What we need is democracy. It is very easy to understand why democracy is needed during the war of resistance. If the people all know that they are the masters of the country, there is no one who would not be willing to dedicate themselves to defending their country. If the people have little connection with the country, then even if they are forced to resist, there is little chance of victory.</p>
<p>There is nothing more needed than the people during the war of resistance. The replenishment of manpower at the front lines requires the people. The transportation and supply of the army requires the people. The supply and rescue in the rear requires the people. In a war of resistance by the entire nation, victory or defeat is not determined by weapons, but by the number of people mobilized. This mobilization includes not only the military aspect but also the political, economic, labor, technical, and cultural aspects. In a civil war, what is needed is only a part of the hired army, but in a war against a foreign enemy, especially a war against a powerful aggressor, it is necessary for the entire population to participate. But whether the broad masses of people, if they cannot participate in the politics of the country, can spontaneously and heroically participate in the war against foreign enemies is indeed a question.</p>
<p>The activities of traitors existing everywhere are indeed a shameful fact. But the fact that there are traitors among the Chinese people does not mean that the Chinese people do not love their country. I believe that most traitors are traitors because their lives are too unconnected with the country, so they will recognize the enemy as their father.</p>
<p>Therefore, to support the war of resistance and achieve final victory, there is only one great road: democracy. As long as the Three Principles of the People are thoroughly implemented, the principles of government of the people, by the people, and for the people are thoroughly practiced, and all the people are organized, so that all the people enjoy legal freedom, not only can national mobilization be completed immediately, but also the unified power of 450 million compatriots can be used to fight against foreign aggression, and final victory will not be a problem. And only in this way is the only road to victory.</p>
<p>Today is National Day, and it is also our first National Day after resisting the brutal Japanese. If we do not forget the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for national independence and freedom, and if we still remember the teachings of the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, we should wholeheartedly rise up together and, following the path of democratic unity, strive for the glorious victory of the imperiled Republic of China. "Be cruel to the enemy, be tolerant to our own people!" This saying especially needs to be kept in mind by everyone at all times.</p>
<p>Editor's note: This article was written to commemorate National Day. Due to space limitations, it could not be published in yesterday's newspaper, so it is being published today.</p>

<h3>Zhang Zizhong Stays in Nanjing Awaiting Punishment</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Zhang Zizhong, former Mayor of Tianjin, arrived in Nanjing from Jinan a few days ago. When reporters interviewed him, Zhang said, "I am a soldier, and it is my duty to defend the country and guard the territory. I dare not lag behind others. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, I immediately actively deployed defenses. Later, Chairman Song ordered me on July 28 to go to Baoding and instructed me to stay in Beiping to act as the Military and Political Affairs Officer of Hebei and Chahar. Under orders, I felt deeply apprehensive, fearing that my talent would not be up to the task and would delay the overall situation. I repeatedly declined, but in the end, I had to accept the order with tears. I then ordered the Shi Brigade stationed in the city to ensure the order of Beiping and resist the Japanese army. On the one hand, I sent personnel to contact the troops stationed in Baoding, and on the other hand, I telegraphed Vice Division Commander Li Wentian in Tianjin to lead his troops to work hard to kill the enemy, and telegraphed the officers and soldiers not to forget that they were Chinese citizens. Later, because the connection between Beiping and Baoding was cut off, and most of the enemy troops were forcing their way into the suburbs, trapped in the isolated city, and external aid was cut off, I ordered the Shi Brigade to break through to Chahar. I also led the pistol team out of Beiping. Unexpectedly, as soon as I left Deshengmen, I was attacked by the enemy's ambush troops, causing me to lose contact with the Shi Brigade. I had no choice but to return to the city and hide in Beiping. On September 3, I went to Tianjin alone and transferred south. When passing through Jinan, I stayed for more than ten days due to illness. During this time, I met with Chairman Han Xiangfang several times. His loyalty to resisting the enemy and defending the country has been consistent from beginning to end, and there are already facts to show it. The rumors that I lobbied Chairman Han for the Japanese while passing through Shandong were purely enemy tactics to sow discord. I have now arrived in Nanjing from Beiping, and these rumors should be self-defeating. I have been in the army for twenty years, and I love the country's support and the leader's training. Although my nature is foolish, I am confident in my loyalty. However, due to my lack of talent and the exhaustion of my strength, I failed the mission of the party and the country, and I dare not shirk the blame for the mistake. This time, I came to Nanjing to report the situation to the Chairman and the Central Committee, and to request punishment. The National Government issued a clear order to rectify discipline, only removing me from office and investigating, without adding strict condemnation. Yesterday, I met with the Chairman and received encouragement, allowing me to atone for my sins. I am deeply grateful and moved. If there is a chance to serve in the future, I swear to use my remaining life to fight desperately to defend the country under the guidance of the great and selfless national leader, and I will not hesitate to go through fire and water. As for my current whereabouts, I will stay in the capital as a criminal awaiting orders." (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Asahi Shimbun</h3>
<p>Comments on the Japanese Foreign Ministry Declaration</p>
<p>[Tokyo] An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun on the 10th, commenting on the statement issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 9th, said that the traces of caution are clearly visible, but it only carefully considers and diligently makes up for the defects of the frank statement made by the Foreign Ministry spokesman a day earlier. It is doubtful whether its strength is enough to explain the unprecedented situation in which Japan is using the power of the whole country to fight. Everyone has a feeling of inadequacy. Although the Nine-Power Treaty has not been abolished or changed, the changing situation means that it is not a completely effective treaty. It would not be wrong to call it a dead letter. Therefore, the one point that has been reserved and not stated, whether or not to participate in the Nine-Power Conference, should be stated in a dignified manner that it will not participate. Even if it participates, it must first propose to abolish or greatly revise the treaty to deal with the situation. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet Naval Maneuvers in the Baltic Sea Come to an End</h3>
<p>Aircraft Assist in Battle, Submarines Show Their Power; Exercise Results Are Very Satisfactory</p>
<p>[Moscow] According to news from Kronstadt, the autumn maneuvers of the Soviet Baltic Red Banner Fleet have been declared over. It is reported that the submarines and air forces participating in the autumn maneuvers, which were inspected by Defense Commissar Marshal Voroshilov, successfully completed the various difficult and complex tasks assigned to them. This is the first time that a large number of warships have participated in such a large-scale exercise. The exercise showed that the Soviet Navy is very skilled in the use of smoke screens and smoke screen tactics. Torpedoes fired by submarines during the attack all hit their targets, and aircraft performed well in night operations. Defense Commissar Marshal Voroshilov also convened a meeting of naval personnel participating in the exercise and delivered a long speech, praising the achievements made in the exercise. The conference then passed a resolution in warm applause to send a telegram to Stalin to express respect. (TASS 9th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Attaché to China Arrives in Moscow</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Soviet Embassy's Army Attaché Le Yun, was recalled on the 5th of this month and flew back to Moscow. It has now been learned that he has arrived safely. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Counter-Revolutionaries</h3>
<p>Another Fourteen Executed</p>
<p>[Moscow] Fourteen people were executed in Belarus today, all convicted of sabotage and acting as Trotskyist opposition spies. Among them were five senior officials of the Grain Trust, all of whom admitted to parasitism, mixing large quantities of grains, preventing the construction of cranes, disrupting the distribution of food, and mixing glass and iron filings into the Red Army's grains. All of the above were acts against the people and the government. The other nine were convicted of attempting to sabotage the Belarusian railway under the instructions of Polish and Japanese intelligence agencies.

<h3>British Submarine Drills in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou] According to foreign news, the British Fourth Submarine Squadron stationed in Hong Kong will conduct drills in the southeast of Hong Kong from the 11th to the 15th, in order to strengthen Hong Kong's coastal defenses.

<h3>Italy Refuses to Negotiate on Spanish Issue with Britain and France</h3>
<p>Advocates Continued Discussion by the Non-Intervention Committee / European Situation Becomes Tense Again / Britain and France Consider Countermeasures</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the suggestion of Britain and France inviting Italy to hold talks and discuss the non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, the Italian government submitted a reply today, rejecting it and stating that Italy advocates that the issue of non-intervention should continue to be discussed by the London Adjustment Committee. This reply has been published simultaneously in Paris and London. Its content states that the Italian government has taken note of the guarantees provided by Britain and France regarding respecting Spain's political independence. The Italian government also declared its determination to maintain Spain's territorial integrity. Regarding the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries from Spain, Italy and Germany were the first to propose it. Although the Italian government attaches importance to the proposal by Britain and France to hold talks to discuss this matter, this issue is not only related to certain countries. In addition to Britain, France, and Italy, other countries are also directly involved. This fact should be noted. Moreover, any decision, if not accepted by both parties in the Spanish Civil War, will inevitably fail to produce practical results. It is recalled that the representative of the Valencian government of Spain, in his speech at the League of Nations General Assembly, used the pretext that the foreign volunteers belonging to his government were of a different nature from those belonging to the Nationalist army and expressed his unwillingness to withdraw them. The Italian government therefore firmly believes that any procedure, even if it is a preliminary procedure, if taken outside the framework of the London Adjustment Committee, will not only fail to reduce all misunderstandings and disputes but will aggravate them, delaying the establishment of a general agreement. This is not a wise move. In addition, the Italian reply also stated that the Italian government does not wish to participate in any talks or meetings that do not formally invite the German government to participate or in which the German government does not participate. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Mussolini's rejection of Britain and France's request, refusing to directly negotiate the recall of Spanish volunteers, has caused the European situation to take a sharp turn. If Britain and France do not swallow their pride and retreat, they will put into practice their earlier statement to open the French-Spanish border, allowing volunteers from various countries to freely enter Spain. Today, within hours after receiving Italy's reply of rejection, the foreign ministries of both countries convened meetings to discuss whether to take retaliatory measures. Officials acknowledge that both countries must take some action immediately to counter Mussolini's determination to maintain or increase Italy's military presence in Spain. Otherwise, the Spanish government forces may fail, and Spain will become a fascist state ruled by Italy. As for the rumors that France has decided to open the border on Monday, they are not entirely credible. The British Foreign Office has stated that there will be no unexpected actions this week. Political circles deeply believe that Britain and France may have to resort to force to prevent a European war. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Italian Government Conscripts New Soldiers</h3>
<p>If the French-Spanish Border is Opened / Italy Will Publicly Aid the Spanish War</p>
<p>[Rome] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has begun to conscript troops today to prepare for retaliatory measures by Britain and France. Officials claim that the three classes of conscripts from 1907, 1908, and 1909 have been ordered to prepare for deployment at any time. Diplomatic circles generally believe that if France opens the border, these Italian troops will be sent to Spain. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Well-informed sources here say that Italy's reply to Britain and France's invitation to participate in the three-nation conference is constructive because Italy will never give up its determination to defeat communism in Spain in the slightest. However, to prevent the peace mechanism from being suspended, it has suggested further discussions within the Non-Intervention Committee. Therefore, the responsibility for how to proceed from now on rests entirely with Britain and France. It is said that if the French-Spanish border is opened, the hope for European peace will hang by a thread. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>German Defense Minister Arrives at Funshal Island</h3>
<p>Arousing General Attention</p>
<p>⊙ Portuguese-owned Funshal Island, West Africa. German Defense Minister General Blumberg arrived here from Germany aboard the German light cruiser "Greer" and landed here yesterday. (Note: Funshal Island is a Portuguese territory in the Atlantic Ocean. Germans have been active on the island for a long time, and its military significance is quite important. Therefore, General Blumberg's sudden visit to the island has aroused general attention). (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Government Prepares to Move Capital to Barcelona</h3>
<p>⊙ Perpignan, France. According to news from Barcelona, the Spanish Republican government plans to move its seat from Valencia to that city, and preparations are actively underway. Given the current situation, it is very inconvenient for the various government departments to operate in Valencia. Moreover, since the government forces have been reorganized, there is no need for the government seat to be close to Madrid. Spanish President Azaña has already moved to Barcelona since last November. After the government moves, it can work in conjunction with the president, and the general life in Barcelona remains normal, making it more convenient to establish administrative agencies and creating better working conditions. In addition, the establishment of the government in Barcelona also signifies the internal unity of the Spanish Republic. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Coming and Going Amidst Bombing</h3>
<p>— Guo Moruo</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>I arrived in Suzhou on the evening of the twenty-first and called Qiaofeng on the phone. Qiaofeng had already left. I decided to stay overnight in Wuxian that night.</p>
<p>The place where I stayed had osmanthus flowers, which were emitting a strong, sweet fragrance in the dark. There were occasional air raid alarms, but I was very calm. I slept very soundly, because all my luggage was newly made in Shanghai when I came, and I felt quite comfortable.</p>
<p>The next day, because I had to wait for the car to come from the front, I had plenty of leisure. I toured Suzhou City in the morning. The citizens were still calm, but most of the shops were closed. I found this psychology a bit ridiculous. Closing the shops is probably to prevent bombing, but if the plane's bombs don't hit your shop, why do you need to close the door! If the bombs hit your shop, what's the use of closing the door? It's more accurate to say that everyone is not brave enough, rather than not smart enough.</p>
<p>I remembered that there were two old seniors in Suzhou who were worth visiting specially, one was Mr. Li Genyuan, and the other was Mr. Zhang Yimo. These two gentlemen, according to my impressions from the visits, are truly worthy of being called "great elders of the world."</p>
<p>I met Mr. Li in a small farmer's house. He was dressed unusually plainly, and at first sight, he reminded me of Guan Zhuangmiao in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."</p>
<p>Mr. Li was in very good spirits, but he had some kind of skin disease on the right side of his neck, with the skin appearing copper-colored and scaly, causing swelling of the lymph nodes under his right jaw. Mr. Li spoke vigorously and intensely, as if recalling the general who commanded the three armies in the past.</p>
<p>Mr. Li said that his idea was "internal king and external hegemon." He advocated that China's actions should only focus on national defense, and all constructions that beautify peace are unnecessary. The result of the Battle of Songhu proved this.</p>
<p>Mr. Li also said that before the thirteenth, he didn't admire Mr. Chiang very much, but after the thirteenth, he could kowtow to him.</p>
<p>When he said these words, his attitude was unusually sincere, and his bright eyes seemed to have moisture, and fine beads of sweat appeared on his face.</p>
<p>The American missionaries in Suzhou are very enthusiastic about rescuing wounded soldiers. Soldiers enjoy entering Suzhou hospitals, because the surgery is good and the treatment is also good. After the death of American envoy Johnson, the missionaries withdrew from China, but the missionaries were unwilling to leave. This news was also told to me by Mr. Li.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's impression was similar to Guan Yu; Mr. Zhang's impression was quite similar to Zhuge Kongming. Mr. Zhang is not very tall, with a triangular face, no beard, and fair skin. Although he has no lun towel or feather fan, his clear and bright aura is evident.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang is the organizer of the "Laozi Army" that spread widely in the recent newspapers. His organization was naturally interrupted by Mr. Chiang's telegram obstruction, but he had a reply telegram, which has not yet been spread in the newspapers. Mr. Zhang took out the draft telegram for me to see. The draft was written in ink on the back of several large waste calendar papers. The wording was earnest and moving. I asked Mr. Zhang to publish it in the "National Salvation Daily," and Mr. Zhang readily agreed.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang said that he met Mr. Feng Huanzhang somewhere a few days ago. Mr. Huanzhang said that he was in good spirits. He said, "I am usually not well and often get sick, but since August 13th, my spirits have been a hundred times better, and I have no illnesses at all."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang also said that we Chinese have always been unable to stand up straight, but this time we have stood up straight. We Chinese usually pay two or three thousand in compensation for killing one or two Japanese, but this time we have killed twenty or thirty thousand of them. If this were in peacetime, I don't know how much compensation we would have to pay. Mr. Zhang called me to "calculate" it, saying, "I'm afraid there will be a lot of zeros."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's desk had a short scroll that he had just written, a copy of Su Changgong's "Letter from the Edge of Heaven," written "two days after Mid-Autumn Festival." Two days after Mid-Autumn Festival was September 21st, the day I arrived in Suzhou. I asked for Mr. Zhang's calligraphy, and Mr. Zhang said, "I'll give you this one as a souvenir. It doesn't have an inscription, is that okay?" I said, "It's perfect without an inscription." (Yes, it was really perfect. If someone like Mr. Zhang wrote an inscription for me and politely called me "Mr.," I would always feel ashamed.)"</p>
<p>So Mr. Zhang hurriedly went to get a newspaper, rolled up the calligraphy, and handed it to me.</p>
<p>I truly felt like I had obtained an unparalleled treasure.</p>

<h3>This City's Boy Scouts Released a Letter to World Boy Scouts Yesterday</h3>
<p>We Cannot Allow the Enemies of World Culture to Run Rampant / Unite to Unleash the Power of International Children</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Boy Scouts of this city have been serving the front and rear areas, working hard. In order to urge Boy Scouts around the world to pay attention to the aggressive atrocities of the enemy army and give us active assistance, a letter to World Boy Scouts was specially released yesterday. Now we explore and record its original text as follows,</p>
<p>Dear Boy Scout brothers and sisters all over the world, not many days after the end of the World Boy Scout Conference in the Netherlands, a tragic human massacre unfolded in Shanghai, East Asia. The warlords of Japan, in order to satisfy their personal desires, have disregarded the wishes of the people at home and sacrificed the happiness of the people. They have brazenly launched a large-scale invasion of the territory of our Republic of China. The Chinese people are a peace-loving nation, but now, in order to fight for national freedom, to seek national equality, and to uphold world justice and peace, they have made the determination to resist to the end and no longer cherish any sacrifice to deal with the enemy. The war here has spread to all of China. We have witnessed the Japanese artillery destroy our culture, slaughter our people, and burn our houses. The human nature of benevolence seems to have been extinguished, the world's civilization seems to have died, and justice and fairness seem to have disappeared. The Chinese army has taken on the great mission of striving for the real peace of the world. We long for peace, but we do not seek false peace under coercion. We love peace, but we love even more the struggle for peace. The Shanghai Boy Scouts have risen up to do their best for the soldiers fighting for human peace and for our innocent refugees, and to engage in service work in the war zone. Boy Scout brothers and sisters all over the world, in order to uphold the dignity of our oath and unleash the power of our international children, we can no longer allow the enemies of world culture to run rampant, and we cannot allow the dehumanized militarists to be tyrannical. The Shanghai Boy Scouts have become the vanguard of the world Boy Scouts, and the Shanghai Boy Scouts are eagerly awaiting the assistance of the world Boy Scouts. Let us unite to annihilate the enemies of the world Boy Scouts.</p>
<h3>National Day Comfort</h3>
<p>Various Groups Head to the Front and Rear to Extend Respects</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association believes that on the occasion of the National Day celebration and during the full-scale war of resistance, soldiers at the front and wounded soldiers at the rear should be given great comfort to show the sincerity of shared hatred against the enemy. In addition to sending a telegram to the front requesting personnel to pick up 500,000 anti-Japanese biscuits, 500,000 cigarettes, and 500 woolen vests, Yang Weiyu, Pan Yangyao, Wang Yiwu, Pan Chuitong, Ren Jinping, and others were appointed to represent the association to visit various wounded soldier hospitals in Shanghai to express their condolences. It is reported that each wounded soldier will be given a sanitary shirt, a pair of socks, a towel, and a pack of cigarettes. In addition, due to the excellent service of the Boy Scouts, 300 portions of refreshments were prepared and sent to the Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps for distribution.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the rescue hospital run by the Relief Committee of the Joint Charity Organizations War Zone Refugees Relief Committee has cured many wounded soldiers. There are still a few who are being treated. Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, the chairman of the association, Qu Wenliu, and the vice-chairman, Huang Hanzhi, personally went to the hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers and express their respect for their bravery in killing the enemy.</p>
<p>The Children's National Salvation Association prepared a large number of comfort bags filled with dry food, printed with "Return Our Rivers and Mountains," on the National Day memorial day yesterday. Four members were sent to the front line in the rain to comfort the soldiers resisting the enemy. The Drama Department was also divided into groups. Group A, including Shen Jun, Xu Xiangying, Tang Genbao, and Jiang Baisheng, went to the First Wounded Soldier Hospital to rehearse "In the Midst of Artillery Fire." Group B, including Wang Ziqing, Jiang Quqiao, Yang Bijun, and Yao Yuanyan, went to the Tenth Wounded Soldier Hospital to rehearse "Put Down Your Whip." The brave soldiers and nurses watching the play couldn't help but feel indignant and weep.</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Industrial Circle National Salvation Association, and the National Postal Workers' Union believe that our loyal soldiers are fighting bloody battles to seek survival for the nation and justice for the world. The people in the rear should enthusiastically express their condolences to encourage morale. Therefore, yesterday, Zhou Xuexiang was recommended by the Federation of Trade Unions, Long Peiling was recommended by the Industrial Circle National Salvation Association, Shao Xubai was recommended by the Postal Workers' Union, and Zhang Kechang was recommended by the National Postal Workers' Union, to go to various wounded soldier hospitals in the city to express their condolences to the wounded and brave soldiers. At the same time, the association plans to raise funds to cast anti-Japanese commemorative medals engraved with the words "National Hero," tied with red ribbons, and distribute them to the soldiers who resisted the war as a memento.</p>
<p>The Relief Committee of the Shanghai Fellow Association of the Five Counties of Zhen, Dan, Jin, Li, and Yang specially appointed the vice chairman of the association, Han Jingqi, executive committee member Ma Rugen, secretary director Tang Jianhou, and staff Yue Weixian, to carry biscuits, candies, and other items to various wounded soldier hospitals to express their condolences.</p>
<p>In order to commemorate the National Day, the Chinese Women's National Defense Association held a joint party for various groups at its headquarters yesterday morning. At 2:00 p.m., they took towels, preserved tangerine peel, candies, anti-Japanese biscuits, and letters of condolence to various wounded soldier hospitals to express the respect of the people in the rear for the soldiers resisting the enemy.</p>
<p>Yesterday was Double Tenth Day. In order to create this meaningful commemoration, people from all walks of life sent comfort money and comfort goods to the Shanghai Comfort Committee for forwarding to the front. The report is as follows:</p>
<p>The Commercial Press stated that because National Day fell on a Sunday, it was originally scheduled to take a day off today. However, due to the severity of the national crisis, it was decided to work as usual today and send all the salary that should be compensated to colleagues for one day to the Shanghai Comfort Committee, instructing them to purchase goods to comfort the soldiers. One thousand yuan was sent in advance yesterday, and the rest will be settled and supplemented when the salary is paid.</p>
<p>The staff of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department specially collected 330 yuan, 0 jiao, and 7.8 fen yesterday and sent it to the Shanghai Comfort Committee, instructing them to purchase cold-proof cotton vests for comforting the soldiers resisting the enemy at the front.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fellow Association of the Seven Counties of Shaoxing, considering that the soldiers at the front urgently needed cotton vests, specially made 5,000 pieces. 2,000 pieces of the finished products were completed yesterday and sent to the Shanghai Comfort Committee for inspection and acceptance, and transported to the front for application.</p>
<p>Mr. Guan Yuting, the manager of the Yangtze Hotel, is very nationalistic. After the August 13th Incident, in addition to spending money to purchase a large number of medicines and comfort goods to personally visit the Eighth Wounded Soldier Hospital, he also ran around soliciting donations and making his own donations, totaling 11,000 sacks, 2,000 cotton vests, and 10 new bicycles, which were sent to the Comfort Committee for transportation to the front. In addition, a large number of bicycles and running shoes are being solicited.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 9th, Binhai Middle School and the Commercial Vocational Middle School of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce solicited comfort bags from all walks of life. By midnight, 4,570 bags were obtained, and 457 yuan and 5 jiao were actually received, which were sent to the Municipal Anti-Japanese Support Association for submission to the military authorities.</p>
<p>The drivers of the Shanghai Automobile Drivers' Union Yunfei Automobile Company donated 236 cotton vests to the soldiers at the front because the weather was getting colder. They have been forwarded by the Shanghai Youth Wartime Service Corps.</p>
<p>The park friends of the Taijiquan Research Association in the French Park of this city, in order to comfort the soldiers resisting the war, specially allocated two yuan per person from this month's dinner fee to be used as comfort donations, totaling more than 60 yuan. It is heard that these people have decided that if the war of resistance does not stop, they will donate for a long time. Members of the Chinese Women's Movement Alliance have raised thousands of cotton vests. The 32nd Division of the Army received 200 pieces the day before yesterday (50 of which were donated by Qian Jianqiu). Yesterday, they received 221 cotton vests donated by the British American Tobacco Company, all of which had official receipts from the division, and received them from the association to distribute them to the patriotic soldiers to keep them warm. Yesterday, they also received 100 pieces of silk floss and cotton vests raised by Zhou Cuiying, the principal of Weifeng Girls' School, and 1,361 packages of first aid kits for military use, one package of absorbent cotton, and one package of medicine. The association is continuing to raise and produce them, and will send them to the front one after another.</p>
<h3>Women's Delegation Set Off Yesterday in the Rain to Present Flags to Commanders in the Front Line Area</h3>
<h3>More Remains of Bombings Appear in Qibao Town</h3>
<p>Ginning Mill Suffers Heavy Losses Gentry and Merchants Yesterday Gave Lectures on Air Defense</p>
<p>At 4:00 p.m. on the 6th of this month, enemy bombers dropped four bombs in the downtown area of Qibao Town, at the intersection of Tang Bridge and North Main Street, destroying municipal buildings and causing more than 30 casualties among the villagers. Afterwards, the town's rescue team rescued 15 seriously injured people and sent them to Shanghai for treatment, and found 13 corpses, which were buried together. It is now known that the team has been searching in the rubble for days, and has found several more bodies. There is a skull, a child's arm and a foot on the beach on the north side of the bridge, which have been buried. It is reported that two of the treated people have also died. The losses suffered by the town are difficult to estimate for a while. However, according to the observer's observation, only the Yang Dingyuan ginning mill in North Street suffered heavy losses. In view of this disaster, the gentry and merchants of the town set off in teams on Double Tenth Day to give lectures on air defense to avoid repeating the mistakes.</p>
<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Britain's Attitude</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Chamberlain recently delivered a speech at the Conservative Party Congress, expressing his appreciation for US President Roosevelt's views on the world situation and solemnly stating, "The British government is willing to cooperate with all countries to maintain treaties and promote peace." The two major friendly countries, Britain and the United States, in order to prevent the growth of international aggression forces, have now made a preliminary expression of their willingness to assume practical obligations for the Nine-Power Treaty and the Pact of Paris. This is very inspiring for us who are suffering from aggression.</p>
<p>However, we must point out that there are many ambiguous places in the treaty text. Only by having all peaceful countries resolutely sanction the aggressor can the treaty have a real effect. Otherwise, the treaty will still become 'a scrap of paper,' which will only make the aggressor's arrogance even higher. From the historical facts of the past, we can find many examples.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that all aspects of the British government and public support our country and hate the aggressors in the Far East. However, we cannot help but wonder whether the British government has the determination to unite with other peaceful countries to jointly sanction the aggressive forces for the sake of world peace and the interests of its own future. The recent League of Nations resolution avoiding the word 'aggression,' the opposition of British public opinion (such as The Times of London, the Daily Express, the Daily Telegraph, and even the Shanghai North China Daily News) to economic sanctions, and the British government's shirk of the location of the Nine-Power Treaty conference, all these facts show that Britain is still unwilling to offend the aggressive countries and is still hesitating at the crossroads.</p>
<p>This traditional attitude of Britain has clearly threatened world peace, and the prestige of the American Empire has been greatly reduced. We hope that the new development of the international situation will no longer allow it to hesitate at the crossroads.</p>

<h3>Nanjing Road on Double Tenth Day</h3>
<p>The Voices of the Masses Resound Through the Sky We Are an Iron Group We Must Expel the Enemy from the Country</p>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) No Double Tenth Day has ever been as exciting as this year's! Soldiers at the front are fighting for national survival under the enemy's artillery fire: how excited are the people in the rear with their anti-Japanese sentiments, welcoming the arrival of the 26th National Day with blood-red marks. I have no better words to describe it. When the flags of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth are flying on the roofs of every household, the soul of the Chinese nation is roaring!</p>
<p>At 9:00 in the morning, I and a friend stepped onto Nanjing Road in the rain. The road was washed by the rain all night, almost as smooth and crystal clear as a mirror. The national flag flying in the sky, without me even looking up, its clear reflection on the road had already entered my eyes. So, this road gradually became unfamiliar to me; if it weren't for a few patrolmen patrolling the sidewalk, I would have forgotten that I was in the concession. Arriving near the throwing field, my companion first saw someone posting slogans on the glass windows of the store, "Down with Japanese Imperialism!" It exploded like a bomb in the blood vessels of every pedestrian, and immediately countless mouths shouted in different directions. Although the patrolling patrolmen followed and tore down those slogans, they were only doing it for duty reasons. As soon as the ones in the back were torn off, the ink stains in the front were posted on the glass windows again.</p>
<p>When the big clock on the Jianghai Customs Building struck twelve o'clock, a majestic party song was broadcast on the radio. At this time, the pedestrians on the road all stood still in the rain, and everyone solemnly followed the singing. In this majestic voice, countless strong hearts were connected together, "We are an iron group! We must defeat our only enemy!" When this voice came from behind me, a dozen Xiang Sheng cars flew to the intersection of Nanjing Road, with four or five or six people in each car. They all quickly jumped out of the carriages, and countless leaflets were distributed to people's hands. At the same time, "Arise, you who refuse to be slaves!" The March of the Volunteers was sung loudly from every corner. The junior staff in the stores held the distributed leaflets in their hands. They seemed to have no extra effort to read what was written on the leaflets carefully, and looked up, singing "Braving the enemy's artillery fire, forward! forward! forward! advance!" This lyric was really too kind to them, and how urgently they hoped to have an opportunity to melt the accumulated grief and anger into this majestic song!</p>
<p>Once, again... It didn't stop until someone shouted slogans. But the shout of "Down with Japanese imperialism, expel the enemy from the country! Long live the Three People's Principles! Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! Long live the Republic of China!" Responded even more strongly.</p>
<p>Such a generous and passionate situation is unprecedented in every mass scene. What is even more commendable is that everyone can strictly maintain order. When a dozen cars began to parade, countless crowds followed like a tide, the patrolmen were more polite in helping to maintain order, but when the car reached Chengdu Road, they were not allowed to drive westward, so the car turned south into Weihaiwei Road and left, but the pedestrians still sang the marching song and moved forward westward.</p>
<p>At the same time, a solemn memorial ceremony was also launched at the entrance of the Golden Grand Theater in the French Concession: at twelve noon, traffic at the crossroads was temporarily declared cut off, all vehicles stopped, and some people came out of the cars and stood on the road, singing the Party Song, the March of the Volunteers, shouting slogans, and dispersing.</p>
<p>We turned into a deserted road</p>
<p>When we came back, we saw a group of children, with the oldest one as the leader, holding a small national flag and singing the March of the Volunteers, walking out of a small alley. This is not an ordinary unconscious game for children, but a symbol of the progress of modern elementary school education.</p>
<p>No Double Tenth Day has ever been as exciting as this year's! (Ping)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Strive to Donate to Save the Country</h3>
<p>Shopkeepers, Vendors, and Women Actively Donate Enemy Goods Face Deserted Shops</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have been actively engaged in national salvation work. From major merchants to vendors and hawkers, everyone is happy to donate to the motherland. Their patriotic enthusiasm is no less than that of people in the country. Here is a letter from a major merchant in Southeast Asia to see the true situation.</p>
<p>Shop Recognition Donation</p>
<p>All large and small shops in Southeast Asia have recognized donations, including special donations, that is, taking out a certain amount at one time, and monthly donations, that is, bearing a certain amount each month, until the end of the war. These two types are quite considerable.</p>
<p>Vendors Repay</p>
<p>Regardless of vendors and hawkers, their patriotism is quite enthusiastic. Those who sell ice water and sweets on the road all repay with the full day's income, including capital. Most of the other fried noodle stalls and night tea places set a date to repay the entire night's business income (tea sellers have female attendants, about 40 or 50 yuan or 10 or 20 yuan per night). The fried noodle stalls repay with capital, which is quite large, about 100 or 200 yuan. Others, such as cargo trucks, various odd jobs, etc., all repay with one day's income.</p>
<p>Flower Girls</p>
<p>Maids, female students, housewives, and even prostitutes all prepare fresh flowers or paper flowers and sell them to shops or passers-by, donating the proceeds to the motherland. The above donations, in addition to the two types of special donations and monthly donations, are mostly collected by each gang through various gang guild halls and transferred to the relief committee for issuing receipts. Other repayers each have a lead box, which is issued by the relief committee. Donors throw money into the box themselves. Any size box can be obtained.</p>
<p>Theater Amusement</p>
<p>Recently, various amusement parks have opened fundraising meetings to donate to the country (various manufacturers in the park repay for the sale of goods). Thousands of people, including various opera troupes and male and female students from various schools, have participated in singing marching songs and "Anti-Japanese Songs," etc.</p>
<p>Collecting Old Clothes</p>
<p>Those who shake bells along the way and use cargo trucks to solicit old clothes pass by the store many times a day. Currently, tens of thousands of pieces have been received in the Xingbu area alone. It is heard that the first batch has been loaded. There are also many who donate original bolts of white cloth for bandaging the injured. It is heard that there are also hundreds of thousands of pieces in other ports, which will be loaded back to the country.</p>
<p>Japanese Shops</p>
<p>The shops opened by Japanese people face deserted shops. The Chinese boycott is very fierce. The sales of British and American goods have increased greatly. Craven "A" (one corner per pack) cigarettes and Electric Light brand (five cents per pack) cigarettes were originally the best-selling here. This time, rumors were spread that the company borrowed money from the Japanese, so all Malay Chinese did not smoke this cigarette. Now the company publishes newspapers every day to refute the rumors and donates a large amount of cigarettes, but it is feared that it will be very difficult to restore the previous sales. Other cases, such as Bata shoe stores, have also occurred. This shows the greatness of the power of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Chinese Shops</p>
<p>Chinese shops, such as those who do not donate (donate a little later), are prone to suffer a great impact on their business, because public anger is difficult to offend at present. It is heard that a Da Sanyuan cake shop, because the donation was not refreshing, the large amount of moon cakes prepared before the Mid-Autumn Festival was not sold or purchased by anyone. This kind of thing is not just one case, there are many other similar things.</p>
<h3>Businessmen and Merchants Unanimously Recognize Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Nanyang Tobacco Company 250,000 Business Community General Team Continues to Raise 90,000 Yarn Industry Sub-Team 63,000</p>
<p>The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company's main factory is located on Broadway Road. This time, the Japanese army invaded again, and the factory was the first to bear the brunt, suffering heavy losses. In addition to sending the factory's employees back with wages, the company's factories in Hong Kong and Singapore are still working hard to manufacture and continue to struggle, and in order to express their enthusiasm for saving the country, they specially recognized the purchase of 250,000 yuan of national salvation public bonds, and formulated long-term donation and salary donation methods for all employees: ㊀ Each long-term worker donates 5% of their salary in the long term, ㊁ 3/1000 of the total business volume is donated in the long term, ㊂ 10% of the food expenses are donated in the long term, ㊃ Each agency donates 2% of the commission in the long term, ㊄ The teachers and staff of each charity school donate 5% of their salary in the long term, ㊅ The students of each charity school save food and donate in the long term.</p>
<p>The National Salvation Public Bonds Business Community Fundraising General Team yesterday reported that the amount of public bonds raised by various industries was as follows: 32,560 yuan for the electrical appliance manufacturing industry, 27,820 yuan for the lace embroidery industry, 17,518 yuan for the hotel industry in the second batch, 6,732 yuan for the clock and watch industry, 5,435 yuan for the advertising industry, 3,950 yuan for the knitting industry, 3,900 yuan for the department store industry, 360 yuan for the pawn industry in the second batch, totaling 98,277 yuan.</p>
<p>The Yarn Industry Guild recently organized a fundraising yarn industry sub-team for national salvation public bonds. Since its establishment, the team members have been enthusiastic about fundraising. The current payment recognition purchase, and has been reported to the business community general team, including Nangong Mao 10,000 yuan, Yichang 8,000 yuan, Futai Qingji New Number and Yida 5,000 yuan each, Zhenda Chang 4,000 yuan, Jingfeng and Tongtai Chang 3,500 yuan each, Xin Gongmao, Hong Zhaoyao, Baofeng, and Xintai 3,000 yuan each, Cuifu 2,000 yuan, Jiukang 1,500 yuan, Hema, Qiang Maoji, Ganheng, Zhu Peiji, Shi Donglai, Yongxing, Yongxing Yuji, Rongxin 1,000 yuan each, and those below 1,000 yuan, totaling more than 63,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>The First Special Zone Citizens' Federation of this city believes that the government is issuing national salvation public bonds to concentrate national financial resources to enrich the preparation for the war of resistance. In addition to actively fundraising in coordination with the First Special Zone group, they are now launching fundraising for national savings, which should be undertaken by every citizen, starting today, leading the sub-district associations to conduct fundraising among the citizens. The first phase plans to target 200,000 households. All executive and supervisory committee members of the association will hold a memorial ceremony this morning, and each will establish a national savings passbook to advocate for the citizens.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Banks Open Accounts and Interact</h3>
<p>Facilitating the Clearing of Both Parties' Notes Mutually Sympathetic Agency Exchange</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai's finance has been stable as usual due to the government's effective measures and the cooperation and cooperation of the banking industry. Therefore, foreign banks have great trust in Chinese banks' notes. In addition to establishing a note exchange, they have also opened accounts and interacted with Chinese banks, forming a entrusted agency exchange, which is a new record for Chinese and foreign note exchanges in Shanghai. The New News Agency reporter recorded the various situations as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Set Up Note Exchange</p>
<p>The Bund banks have always cleared notes by sending them to each other for verification and using large drawing slips and consignment methods. There is no fixed place, but whether it is China Bank or not, it is calculated by the general summary. Although Central, China, Transportation, and China General Commercial Banks are Chinese banks, because they are located on the Bund, they also joined the foreign banks association and passed large drawing slips. Since the outbreak of the war, each bank has moved to a safe area to work according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, and is no longer on the Bund. Therefore, the foreign banks abandoned their usual large drawing slip method and sent people to meet at HSBC Bank at 11:30 every morning to check. In fact, it has become a kind of note exchange.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Sympathetic Agency Exchange</p>
<p>Foreign banks have never had interbank deposit and withdrawal transactions with Chinese banks. Although the Central, China, and Transportation Banks joined the foreign bank clearing group on the Bund, they used the consignment method to clear on the same day. There is no credit relationship between each other, and there is no so-called interbank transaction. Now, since the outbreak of the war, it has also made an exception to open interbank transaction accounts with our country's banks, and we have also opened accounts with foreign banks. There are now interbank transactions between each other. Then, for all the notes receivable from each bank on the Bund, it is not necessary to collect them one by one, but they are generally deposited in the foreign bank that interacts with them. Each other is sympathetic and becomes a kind of agency exchange.</p>
<p>Two Groups Telegraphed to Comfort Wang Zhengting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association jointly telegraphed to comfort Wang Zhengting, the Chinese ambassador to the United States: Ambassador Wang Rutang, I heard the voice of sympathy from friendly countries, which shows the hard work of negotiation. I respectfully express my condolences and wish you continued efforts. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association kowtow.</p>
<h3>The Sino-Japanese Trade Association Handles the Closure</h3>
<p>The Small Japan Trade Association, which was initiated by Zhou Zuomin and others last year on January 27, was established to perfunctorily respond to the "Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation" dreamed of by the Japanese financial community, such as Kenji Kodama. For more than a year, in addition to the usual entertainment, there was very little practical work. Recently, our full-scale war of resistance began. This kind of entertainment group has long been unnecessary to set up, so the association has been dissolved invisibly. Yesterday morning, a director of the association explained to the Huadong News Agency reporter who inquired about the association's situation: Our association severed relations with the Japanese side long before the outbreak of the war of resistance. At present, the board of directors is handling the closure and will publish a report if necessary.</p>

<h3>Shanghai West Boy Scout Rescue Team Recruits New Members</h3>
<p>And Solicits a Truck</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai West Boy Scout Battlefield Rescue Team has been working with great spirit in the front and rear to engage in rescue work. Under the leadership of Captain Zheng Liankun and Tao Yayu, the achievements have been remarkable. Recently, in view of the extreme need for education and care in Shanghai West, the team has re-established a sub-team near Beixinjing to facilitate work. Now the team's work is quite busy, so it wants to temporarily recruit a few new members. Those who are interested in engaging in rescue and are willing to sacrifice for the country can register at the Caojiadu Security Corps Headquarters Shanghai West Boy Scout Rescue Team Office. In addition, the team is currently short of a rescue truck (the driver's gasoline is provided by the team itself). If enthusiastic people are willing to donate or temporarily use it on a voluntary basis, they can call (20473) to notify the team and send someone to come and contact them immediately.</p>
<h3>Huang Youfeng's Radio Address on China's War of Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>Fighting for National Survival and Upholding Righteousness for Mankind—We Will Spare No Drop of Blood to Seek a Way Out for the Nation</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Youfeng, former Director of the International Propaganda Department of the Central Propaganda Department, recently published a lengthy article in English, in light of the invading of our territory and the slaughter of our people by the brutal Japanese, which was broadcast externally by the Ministry of Communications Radio Station, to publicize the truth of the Japanese brutality and to call the attention of friendly nations. The article is five to six thousand words long; excerpts of its main points are translated below:</p>
<p>Since the revolution, China, under the leadership of a great leader, has been wholeheartedly dedicated to the construction of a democratic country, with the aim of promoting world security and commercial development. Unfortunately, this effort has been brutally destroyed by the militaristic Japanese imperialism, and the vision of the people of all countries has been obscured. Now, finally, a ray of light has emerged from the thick clouds. Our resistance for survival has aroused the sympathy and attention of the world.</p>
<p>We believe that militaristic nations will inevitably perish, and barbaric nations will inevitably evolve. However, it is absolutely unexpected that a civilized country with ample industry and self-proclaimed sophistication would revert to barbaric times. In the minds of the Japanese, it seems that the term "survival" does not apply to the Chinese people. If Japan succeeds in carrying out its insane militarism, the earth will be plunged into darkness, and all humanity will inevitably groan under the tips of their spears.</p>
<p>In the past, during the Okuma Cabinet era in Japan, twenty-one demands were made on China, attempting to use force to create an exclusive position in China. Now, the Japanese military actions in Peiping-Tientsin and Shanghai are the result of implementing its predetermined plan. Japan's intention to conquer China and make it a second Korea has long been known to the world. This attempt became even more evident during the Tanaka Cabinet. His famous Tanaka Memorial explicitly stated that Japan must first control Manchuria and Mongolia, and then proceed to seize China's resources as a basis for realizing global domination. Japan's words and deeds have never been consistent. Examples of this are too numerous to mention. When it forcibly occupied the border regions of China, it declared that it was taking peaceful steps towards China, but in reality, the opposite was true, and the oppression of force was even greater. Now, not only has it destroyed China's military key areas, but it has also arbitrarily bombed the capital and other cities. The Red Cross rescue teams, hospitals, cultural, and educational institutions, innocent non-combatants, and refugees have all been harmed. Even the British ambassador, a friend of ours, was unfortunately attacked. Even though Japan is adept at using propaganda in various countries, these ironclad facts are placed before us, and even the cleverest arguments cannot escape public opinion.</p>
<p>On August 28, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe declared, "In the current situation, diplomatic means cannot be used. Japan must beat China into submission so that it will no longer have the intention to fight." There is no need to say more about the value of such arrogant remarks. Facts speak louder than words. Whether bombing can deter the Chinese people's resistance, Konoe will probably understand soon. In fact, the more tyrannical Japan becomes, the faster its own destruction will be. China has long been prepared to deal with this sudden change. No matter how great its terror power is, we will certainly not easily give up peace, but when peace is truly hopeless, we will certainly not hesitate to shed the last drop of blood to seek a way out for the nation.</p>
<p>Japan's actions in China have already constituted a real war. All the covenants of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact have been torn up, and the credibility of the signatory countries has also been tied to the execution ground. Unless the international conscience is still blinded by the Japanese militarists, there is now nothing more important than sanctioning Japan's aggression.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, the United States made a sharp request to the Soviet Union, asking it to explain its actions in Northern Manchuria. Now, Japan is not only doing that, but it is also producing the largest war of aggression in modern history. The Chinese people have deep trust in the United States, because the American people have always upheld justice. Since the United States has established the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty with its integrity, it must now speak out righteously and unite with all countries to implement economic sanctions against Japan. This is the only way to stop the militarism of the Japanese militarists and avoid a world war.</p>
<h3>Liu Ruming Expresses Gratitude to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Liu Ruming, Commander of the 68th Army and concurrently Commander of the 143rd Division of the Army, has been reported to have been given a demerit and allowed to remain in his post by the National Government. According to a recent visitor to Shanghai from the front, a telegram was received from Liu, expressing his gratitude for this lenient punishment by the Central Government. He is currently supervising his troops to continue the war of resistance, so that he can still serve the Party and the country in a state of guilt. The battle history of the army and the circumstances of their withdrawal from Chahar Province were explained. Originally, the defense zones in the War of Resistance in Chahar were designated as follows: Nankou and Huailai were defended by Tang's army, Chaigoubao was defended by Sui's army, and the Zhangjiakou area was defended by the 68th Army. The 68th Army first recovered Chongli, then captured Zhangbei, defeating stubborn enemies each time and shooting down many enemy planes, obtaining a great deal of enemy equipment. Later, as the enemy changed its strategy, it greatly reinforced Zhangbei and sent more than 60 planes, tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, attacking Zhangyuan with all its strength. At that time, the 68th Army had been fighting for more than ten days and nights, and with a tired army, it bore a battle line of about 700 miles. All the guns and ammunition were old. Army Commander Liu personally went to the battlefield and strictly supervised his troops, determined to resist the enemy. They attacked Zhangbei three times. Our troops suffered many casualties. In the battles of Dahanuo Dam, Shenweitai, Ciershan, and Wanquan County, they gained and lost positions about twenty times. The casualties of officers and soldiers and the loss of ammunition were countless. The enemy also used airplanes and artillery to cover their advance, launching fierce attacks. Our troops could only resist with blood and spirit, pressing forward one after another. The enemy did not succeed. Just as they were requesting troops and weapons, the bad news came that the enemy had occupied Kongjiazhuang. Although our troops were in a desperate situation, they still fiercely resisted the enemy, and the situation was slightly reversed. Just as they were looking forward to reinforcements and weapons to advance and recover Zhangbei, the even worse news came that the enemy had occupied Bianhuayuan. Our army was surrounded on all sides, and the situation was extremely dangerous. Army Commander Liu had no choice but to temporarily retreat to Xuanhua with tears, vowing to defend the Yanghe River in order to recover what was lost. The army has a register of the names and native places of the wounded and killed officers and soldiers, as well as a detailed table as proof. Currently, the morale of the entire army is still extremely high. They are determined to obey the government, support the leader, resist to the end, and sacrifice to the end, serving as vanguards, killing enemies and achieving results, vowing to recover the former territory, and repay the country.</p>
<h3>Domestic Coded Telegrams Are Received and Sent as Usual by Telegraph Offices</h3>
<p>At the Same Time, All Telegrams Must Be Signed and Sealed by the Person in Charge</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Office announced yesterday that since the 10th of last month, the office can receive coded telegrams as usual. From the same day, when senders send any telegram, they must affix the seal of the organization or store to the bottom of the telegram, and it must be signed and sealed by the person in charge. For private telegrams, in addition to the name and address, the occupation and occupation address should also be written. We hope all sectors will pay attention.</p>
<h3>The Xinjiang Carried Many Foreigners to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The British ship Xinjiang arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday, carrying a large number of mail items and foreign nationals from Peiping-Tientsin, Yantai, Weihaiwei, Qingdao, and other places. According to customs news, the ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai and go north on Thursday. Many refugees from the north will return to their hometowns on this ship.</p>
<h3>Russian Nationals Residing in Peiping-Tientsin Continue to Move South</h3>
<p>Gathering in Tianjin These Days, They Will Come to Shanghai on the Lisheng</p>
<p>In view of the unfavorable local situation, more than 200 Soviet nationals residing in Peiping-Tientsin arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and are temporarily residing there. According to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, a large number of Soviet nationals in Peiping-Tientsin are continuing to come south, and are scheduled to gather in Tianjin in the coming days to take the Lisheng to Shanghai. The ship sailed north from Shanghai on the 8th, passing through Yantai and Qingdao to Tianjin, and is expected to return to Shanghai around the 15th or 16th.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow Townsmen's Association Advises Fellow Townsmen Not to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shang'en'de ship sailed from Yong to Shanghai. The ship carried more than 500 passengers from Yong. At that time, many difficulties arose when they landed. At the same time, the Shanghai market has not recovered, and there are still many refugees. The Ningbo Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai sent a letter to various newspapers in Ningbo yesterday, publishing an advertisement, earnestly advising fellow townsmen not to come to Shanghai at this time, so as not to bring trouble upon themselves.</p>
<h3>The Fujian Fellow Townsmen's Association Ends the Sending of Refugees</h3>
<p>The Fujian Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai and the Anti-Japanese Support Association held a National Day commemorative meeting yesterday. Regarding the issue of sending away refugees, it has been stopped, and the shelter that was operated has also been properly closed. The remaining funds have been transferred to make more than 4,000 cotton vests, which will be sent to the front to meet the needs of the soldiers fighting on the front lines to keep them warm. As for the young people of the association, they are now actively forming a returning hometown service group, which will be able to leave in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships' Fuel Causes Panic</h3>
<p>According to reliable information, after the Mitsui Wharf coal yard, the source of fuel for enemy warships, was destroyed, a large number of enemy warships anchored in the Songkou and the Huangpu River were thrown into panic. Moreover, to date, most of the enemy warships have run out of fuel, and replenishment is impossible, so they are unable to sail.</p>

<h3>Diary of a Military Correspondent (4)</h3>
<p>— Chen Wanli, Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency</p>
<p>October 5</p>
<p>The usual shelling, the usual bombing of enemy and our positions on both sides of the Yunzaobang, is getting closer day by day, and the fierce bloody battle is constantly going on in the areas of Zhabei and Liuhang. Although the senior officers here are disturbed by the ringing of the telephone even in the short sleep time of only four or five hours, their spirit is still very full and strong. It is said that enemy planes often distribute Japanese newspapers in the sky above our position. These newspapers are full of news of the "Imperial Army" victory, just like delirium and dreams, because the victory or defeat of the "Imperial Army" is very clear to our soldiers on the front line. Often, the places occupied by the "Imperial Army" as described in these newspapers are also the places guarded by our soldiers on the front line.</p>
<p>In the silent dark night, hearing the continuous sound of machine guns and the intense light of the searchlight, we know that our air force is active in the sky above the Huangpu River. Everyone silently and remotely looks on, with infinite excitement and joy in their hearts.</p>
<p>October 6</p>
<p>Today, Liuhang is quite quiet, the fierce battle in Zhabei is still going on, and a more intense battle is unfolding along the coast of Yunzao. The attack on our position on the south bank of Yunzaobang was expected long ago, and we are waiting for it all the time. Now, the time we have been waiting for has arrived. I believe our brothers on the front line are all very happy.</p>
<p>In the past two days, enemy captive balloons have risen into the air on the north bank of Yunzaobang. These balloons have obviously completed their reconnaissance mission, so today, the enemy followed up with a forced crossing under the cover of artillery fire. However, until now, our loyal soldiers, braving the dense artillery fire, have given the enemy a major blow after a whole day of continuous attacks. What is the use of crossing the river? Kato Soichi, an enemy soldier captured by us in Zhabei yesterday, was escorted here today. He sat silently in the corner of the house, his face covered with a thick black beard, which could not hide the purple bloodstains on his cheeks. He hung his heavy head in frustration, thinking of his distant beloved wife and old mother. He, until he was taken prisoner, did not know why he was fighting China. Poor Japanese soldiers, poor Japanese people.</p>
<p>Under the flickering candlelight, I silently thought about the fate of the enemy crossing the Yunzaobang River, whether they would die in battle or become prisoners like Kato.</p>
<p>October 7</p>
<p>The battle along the Yunzaobang River is still going on fiercely. Although it is raining continuously, our soldiers on the front line are still continuing to eliminate the enemies crossing the river and prevent the enemy from continuing to cross the river. Although the rain makes it difficult to fight, after the bloody battle that has lasted for thirty-six hours, we obviously have an absolute advantage. According to intelligence, Tokyo has ordered the capture of the Songhu area before October 10 for the battle in Shanghai. October 10 is our National Day. We are now stepping on the blood of the martyrs and fighting with the enemy for survival, independence, and freedom. October 10 is only two short days away from today. The enemy's attempt has obviously become a daydream.</p>
<p>I would like to say to all the compatriots in the country, our Double Ten Festival will arrive in two days. Everyone, forget the current pain and have an exception for some joy. On the one hand, we celebrate our National Day, and on the other hand, we wish for the final victory.</p>
<p>October 8</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, I had an accidental opportunity to go to Shanghai, and now I have returned here. Shanghai, which is full of singing and dancing, is a bit dazzling and strange to see. Although I have only been away from Shanghai for a short ten days.</p>
<p>The first thing I did when I returned here was to ask about today's battle situation. I learned that the fierce battle along the Yunzaobang River is still going on, and a fierce battle will unfold in the dark night. Today, in addition to sinking many enemy ships and killing countless enemies, we also captured three.</p>
<p>Although the rain is constantly falling, enemy planes are still active in Zhabei as usual.</p>

<h3>The Enemy Who Secretly Crossed the River at Xiliufangzhai on the North Bank of Yunzaobang Was Completely Annihilated by Our Troops</h3>
<p>The Enemy Troops Who Crossed the River South at Yanjiawan and Other Places Have Fallen into a Desperate Situation, the Counterattack in Jiangwan and Zhabei Has Been Victorious, and the Enemy Has Been Forced to Retreat, Our Army's Artillery Corps in Pudong Struck Two Enemy Ships Again Yesterday</p>
<p>The front-line report obtained by this newspaper at 2:00 PM today is as follows: (1) The enemy who secretly crossed the river at Xiliufangzhai on the north bank of Yunzaobang, southwest of Liuhang, has been surrounded and painfully attacked by our army and has been completely wiped out. Our army is holding the river and defending firmly. This morning, a small number of enemy troops repeatedly tried to cross the river secretly, but were repelled. (2) The enemy who secretly crossed the river at Yanjiawan, Jiangjiazhai, and Tangqiaozhan has been surrounded on three sides by our army for days, trapped on the riverbank, and has fallen into a desperate situation. They can be completely eliminated in the coming days. From last night until noon today, our army has been attacking the enemy incessantly. The remaining enemies are in a bitter battle. More than ten enemy tanks have been destroyed by us, and more than a thousand enemies have been killed. (3) The position of our army in the area of Shixianggong Temple, west of Luodian, is extremely solid. The enemy has repeatedly attacked and been met with head-on attacks. Since this morning, the front line has been relatively quiet, with only a small number of enemy troops constantly harassing. (4) There is no trace of the enemy near Guangfuzhen. The enemy's attempt to make a detour to secretly cross the Yangjing River has been completely annihilated by our army. (5) Our army's counterattack in Jiangwan and Zhabei has been victorious. In the area of Baziqiao, we attacked in three routes, forcing the enemy to retreat. (6) Our heavy artillery corps in Pudong fired accurately, repeatedly destroying enemy military bases, and yesterday struck two enemy ships in the Huangpu River again. This morning, they fired fiercely at the enemy's position, and the enemy suffered considerable damage.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Who Secretly Crossed the River at Xiliufangzhai Was Completely Annihilated by Our Army</h3>
<p>Yanjiawan, Jiangjiazhai, and Tangqiao Are in Fierce Battle and Being Cleared Along the River —The Enemy Uses Poison Gas to Hinder Our Advance—</p>
<p>The enemy who secretly crossed the Yunzaobang River at Yanjiawan, Jiangjiazhai, and Tangqiaozhan, southwest of Liuhang, has had half of them eliminated by our army's brave and fierce attack. The remaining enemies are stubbornly resisting under the cover of dense artillery fire from the enemy army across the river. They once again attacked our army, but after being fiercely suppressed by our army, the enemy collapsed and retreated to the riverbank, with corpses and weapons scattered everywhere. Our army bravely advanced and fought fiercely with the remaining enemies along the river. The remaining enemies stubbornly resisted with the help of enemy artillery across the river. Yesterday, our army increased its troops, and the artillery corps also became very active, counterattacking the enemy army's rear. The entire army of officers and soldiers fiercely attacked forward. Countless remaining enemies fell into the water to escape. The enemy who secretly crossed the river can be completely eliminated. Seeing that there was no way out, the enemy released poison gas to hinder our advance. Many of our soldiers were poisoned, and the progress of the entire army was hindered. However, the remaining troops continued to advance step by step, and there is no doubt that the remaining enemies can be cleared. The enemy who secretly crossed the river at Xiliufangzhai was surrounded by our army's surprise attack. The enemy repeatedly broke out of the encirclement, but could not get out, and has been annihilated by us, all shot to death by our machine guns.</p>
<h3>Our Army Kills the Enemy on Three Routes at Baziqiao</h3>
<p>Fierce Attack With Great Momentum, Steadily Pressing Forward on Guangli Road</p>
<p>A Central News Agency military correspondent reported at 12:00 noon on the 11th that the enemy army in Jiangwan and Zhabei had been harassing us incessantly for days. In order to take the initiative, we changed from defense to offense. At 3:00 AM this morning, our army divided its troops into three routes from Baziqiao, advancing from Qujiaqiao, Guangli Road, and Yokohama Road, aiming at the Patriotic Girls' School and the No. 63 Flower Garden, launching a fierce attack with great momentum. The enemy army was extremely panicked and immediately dispatched many tanks back and forth on Jiangwan Road to block our army's advance with dense artillery fire. Our side also used flat-firing guns to concentrate firepower and continuously bombard them. The enemy tanks retreated in a hurry, but one of them was destroyed by us, trapped in the mud and unable to move. Our army on Guangli Road continued to press forward step by step, and the fierce battle stopped after an hour and a half. The enemy suffered more than 30 casualties, and we also suffered some losses. On the Dongbaoxing Road side, we took advantage of the victory last night to rush to North Sichuan Road and fought fiercely with the enemy for three hours, killing more than 60 enemies.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Repel the Enemy in Chongfeng on Xiangyin Road</h3>
<p>Finally Recovering Our Original Position</p>
<p>A Central News Agency military correspondent reported at 10:10 AM on the 11th that the rain had subsided slightly last night, and the enemy entrenched in the downtown area braved the rain to attack fiercely along the Xiangyin Road towards our Fudan University and the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School. Our army bravely responded and fought fiercely all night. However, due to the disparity in strength, we moved back slightly. Before dawn this morning, our army took advantage of the new rain, wading through mud and braving bullets, to launch a fierce counterattack against the enemy, charging several times and finally defeating the enemy and recovering the original position. The enemy retreated in panic, leaving many corpses behind, and we intercepted many firearms such as rifles and bullets.</p>
<h3>Our Army in Pudong Bombards Enemy Ships</h3>
<p>Accurately Aiming and Hitting Two Ships, the Enemy Ships Were Heavily Injured and Fled Downstream</p>
<p>Our army's artillery corps in Pudong once again exerted its power last night, fiercely bombarding the enemy ships in the Huangpu River. Our army aimed accurately, and two enemy ships were hit by our artillery fire, suffering heavy injuries, but because the deck had not been pierced, they were still able to move and immediately fled downstream. This morning, after the rain cleared, enemy planes hovered and reconnoitered over our army's position in Pudong, but could not find it. Starting at 8:00, our army's artillery corps fired at the Huangpu River again, and the number of shells fired was not large, but they hit several enemy ships and Hongkou positions.</p>
<p>In addition, it has been clearly investigated that the enemy's Yangshupu Hongda Textile Factory was hit by several shells, destroying 13 or 14 enemy military trucks. The enemy's naval wharf and the Wansui Hall on Minhang Road were all destroyed. Suffering this loss, the enemy hastily retaliated by firing artillery at us from the enemy ships in the Huangpu River. Our Pudong ×××××× and other warehouses were hit by enemy shells and are still burning this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Pudong After Last Night's Artillery Battle</h3>
<p>This Morning's Investigation Shows That Our Losses Were Very Minor—Enemy Bombers Fly to Pudong Again for Reconnaissance</p>
<p>The entire line of Pudong, which had been silent for three days, became extremely tense again last night. Our brave artillery, following the divine power of the night of the 7th, gave the enemy another heavy blow. The sound of our heaviest artillery fire started at 7:45 PM. The enemy ships had been greatly frightened the previous time, and immediately moved one after another in front of the foreign factories and warehouses, firing artillery in retaliation. The two sides fired sometimes densely and sometimes sparsely until about 12:00 midnight, when the bombardment stopped. The enemy fired more than 300 shells, all of which landed in the distant wilderness and fields. This morning's investigation showed that only three or four civilian houses were destroyed, one water carrier died, and an old woman from Tongzhou, Li Chenshi, was injured. Our side fired fewer shells, but they landed in the enemy's positions in Yangshupu and Hongkou, causing a major threat. Several shells hit the enemy's ammunition depot, causing considerable losses. When the artillery battle was fierce, our soldiers along the entire line were on high alert at various ports to prevent the enemy from secretly crossing the river. However, the enemy ships only used machine guns to sweep the shore until dawn, and dared not attack. At 9:00 this morning, an enemy heavy bomber appeared over Pudong, but because the clouds and fog obscured the sky, reconnaissance was difficult, and it only dropped three or four small bombs in the fields, causing no losses to us. The enemy plane flew away at 10:15.</p>
<h3>Another Batch of Enemy Corpses Transported Away From Shanghai</h3>
<p>The three enemy transport ships, Guangdemaru, Diyomaru, and Nagasakimaru, which arrived in Shanghai on the 10th, except for the Guangmaru, which carried a large number of enemy corpses away from Shanghai and back to Japan that afternoon, the remaining two ships are now also loading wounded and dead enemy soldiers. It is expected that they can leave Shanghai this afternoon. It is also learned that this batch of enemy corpses is being transported to Korea and Taiwan to be cremated, and then the ashes will be put into cans and transported to Yokohama for distribution to the families of the enemy soldiers.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Army Uses Women as Spies</h3>
<p>Disguised as Our Soldiers to Reconnoiter Military Information—Discovered by Our Side and Shot to Death</p>
<p>According to Dagongshe, a member of a front-line service group who had just returned from the front told a Dagongshe reporter yesterday that in September, a soldier whose actions were suspicious suddenly appeared in our ××× position. The sentry guarding the area shouted the password, and the soldier looked panicked and intended to escape. The guard immediately shot with a rifle and the soldier fell to the ground after being shot. After inspection, it was found that the soldier was actually a Japanese woman disguised, about 18 or 19 years old, with a bun on her head. An enemy military symbol was found on her body, and it was learned that her name was Momoki Akiko. From the circumstances, it seemed that she was a female spy of the enemy army disguised as our soldier, hoping to mix into our position to reconnoiter military information. It can be said that the enemy army has exhausted its tricks by forcing its weak women to make such a meaningless sacrifice. Their downfall is not far away.</p>
<h3>An Outsider Arrives in Shanghai and Discusses Uprisings in Various Parts of Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Simultaneous Responses in Shenyang and Jilin on September 11th - White Russians Suspected and Executed by Firing Squad, Key Chinese Citizens Under Surveillance</p>
<p>According to reports from British and American newspapers, an outsider recently arrived in Shanghai from Manchuria and described multiple simultaneous uprisings in Manchukuo and the extremely strict news censorship. He stated that residents in Manchukuo dared not discuss current affairs due to fear of the arrogant military police. Moreover, news censorship was extraordinarily strict, with only information beneficial to the Japanese side allowed to be transmitted from Manchuria. Information that was unfavorable, even if extremely important, was impossible for the outside world to know. Even if known, it would be long after the event occurred. Recently, someone using a wireless radio receiver learned of the simultaneous uprisings in various parts of Manchukuo on September 11th. However, the information was vague and impossible to verify. Later, it became known that this did indeed occur. The most intense uprising was in Shenyang. Anti-Japanese elements infiltrated the city one by one several days prior. On the morning of September 11th, they suddenly launched an attack. One team of Manchukuo soldiers stationed in the city rose up in response, killing five officers who tried to stop them. The anti-Japanese elements initially only occupied key positions, occasionally opening fire to snipe, and engaged in street fighting. Before long, their momentum grew. Military authorities realized the Manchukuo soldiers could not be relied upon, so they requested assistance from the Japanese authorities. Later, Japanese troops were dispatched from Korea. Both sides engaged in fierce combat. The rebel army was ultimately defeated due to being outnumbered and retreated into the mountains. Both sides suffered many deaths. Because the Japanese had received a tip beforehand, they were on high alert in other areas. On the night of September 11th, an uprising also occurred in Jilin. Because the Japanese were prepared, the two sides fought for a short while, with some deaths, and then it quieted down. After the Shenyang incident was suppressed, Japanese personnel found evidence on the bodies of the martyred rebel soldiers indicating that someone from the White Russian Residents' Affairs Office had secretly informed the anti-Japanese elements of Japanese military movements. As a result, several White Russians were arrested and executed by firing squad. Therefore, White Russians currently serving the Japanese are not as loyal as before. Japanese living in Manchuria are now filled with unease and are sending their families back to Japan or Dalian. They vaguely claim it is due to possible aerial attacks, but in reality, it is fear of a large-scale anti-Japanese action occurring in the future. Key Chinese citizens in Manchuria are now under strict surveillance by the police, so they are also trying to leave the country. However, Chinese citizens in the Manchukuo government cannot act freely. Even if they want to leave the country, it is impossible. If someone visits them, they are asked in detail about the topics discussed. Furthermore, Russians in Harbin are now also urgently trying to leave the country. It is said that it is impossible to live in Harbin, so several people have sold all their property at extremely low prices and are preparing to end their businesses and move elsewhere. Although the Japanese are on high alert, Manchuria is in a state of panic every day. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japanese harbor suspicions about anyone whose words and actions are not considered purely pro-Japanese. If they are considered to have dangerous thoughts, their lives are not safe.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Strength Exhausted - Fifth Wave of Reinforcements Arrives</h3>
<p>Approximately 2,000 Soldiers Landed at the Qujiang Wharf</p>
<p>Since the enemy began its fourth general offensive on August 28th, it has remained confined to a corner of eastern Shanghai without making any progress. The so-called plan to force our troops to retreat to the Jiading-Nanxiang line by October 10th has become a pipe dream. To attempt another counterattack, a portion of the enemy's fifth wave of reinforcements, approximately 2,000 soldiers, arrived on the giant transport ship "○regon Maru" number 186 at the Qujiang Wharf around 5:00 AM today and immediately disembarked. After the enemy troops disembarked, the ship sailed inland and is now docked at the Huishan Wharf.</p>
<h3>Our Artillery Team's Divine Skill Hits the Toyo Building</h3>
<p>Japanese in Panic and Utter Confusion</p>
<p>Late at night last Friday, around 12:00 AM, our side and the enemy engaged in fierce artillery battles. At that time, the artillery on our right flank fired a shell that hit the middle balcony on the sixth or seventh floor of the Toyo Building on Jiujiang Road. Blocked by the thick wall, it could not penetrate but only blasted a hole in the wall. However, the Japanese police chiefs and others living there were terrified. Afterward, reporters investigated and found that the Toyo Building was a new-style eight-story building. The Japanese Club was located just across the street behind it. At the time, our artillery's target was the club, so when the shell flew through the air to the Toyo Building, it was already heading downwards. If the Toyo Building had not blocked it, the Japanese Club would have suffered significant damage. Nevertheless, our artillery's aiming was remarkably accurate, and although it did not hit the intended target, it was enough to make the enemy's heart tremble. Because our shell exploded in the Toyo Building at the time, the Japanese living in the building all rushed to the ground floor. Their panicked state was truly laughable.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Wharf Destroyed by Enemy Artillery</h3>
<p>Losses of Hundreds of Thousands</p>
<p>The China Merchants Wharf, east of Qichang in Pudong, had more than twenty buildings. Since the outbreak of the war, it has been bombarded by enemy ships, causing extensive damage to all the warehouses. Many have collapsed. Yesterday evening around 5:30 PM, an enemy warship off the coast of Pudong fired sulfur shells directly at the wharf, four or five rounds in a row. This caused a fire inside the warehouses. Due to a large amount of grain stored there, it was easily ignited and burned until about 9:30 PM. Flames shot through the roof of the warehouse. Around 10:00 PM, five or six warehouses were engulfed in flames. For a time, the red light filled the sky, and the fire was even more intense than the previous fire at the China Cotton Corporation Warehouse. It was not fully extinguished until dawn today. The losses amount to hundreds of thousands of gold. Rumors that the Mitsui Warehouse in Pulao caught fire last night were actually a mistake, it was the Chinese Wharf.</p>

<h3>Eliminating the Source of Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>Various Sectors Jointly Organize Inspection Agencies for Strict Investigation - Effectiveness Can Only Be Achieved by Simultaneously Enforcing Consular Visas</p>
<p>According to the New News Agency, customs statistics show that Japanese imports in August were 8,420,750 yuan, and exports of Chinese goods to Japan were 4,260,128 yuan. Although the trade figures have decreased compared to before, they still maintain a normal trade relationship. Therefore, various sectors believe that at the time of the start of the full-scale war of resistance, it is necessary to immediately sever this trade relationship. Otherwise, they are directly helping the enemy's aggressive power. A reporter from the New News Agency interviewed a prominent figure in the domestic goods industry this morning to ask for his opinion on how to eliminate enemy goods. He said, "Due to various reasons, diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not been severed even though the war has been going on for two months. This has led some merchants who do not understand the interests of the country and the nation to secretly trade with Japanese merchants for their own benefit, which is really crazy. If we want to eliminate the source, the previous boycott and inspection methods will not be effective. Because the enemy now controls areas such as Hebei, Chahar, and Shanxi in the north, and the Yangshupu area in Shanghai, enemy goods are not subject to customs inspection. They take advantage of their military power and use traitors to transport and sell them, and change the trademarks of the goods to confuse buyers. Therefore, the most effective way to eliminate the source of enemy goods is for customs to strictly enforce consular visas. Regardless of the country of origin, all imported goods must present a consular visa from the place of origin. At the same time, various industrial and commercial organizations should jointly organize inspection agencies to automatically conduct strict inspections, so that enemy goods can be eliminated and unscrupulous merchants will have no way to carry out their tricks."</p>
<h3>Cholera Has Abated as the Weather Turns Cooler</h3>
<p>However, Attention Should Be Paid to Preventing Diphtheria and Smallpox</p>
<p>Recently, due to the cooler weather, the epidemic of true cholera has greatly abated. Therefore, various epidemic hospitals are preparing to close at the end of this month. However, infectious diseases such as diphtheria and smallpox are coming with the change of seasons. Residents should go to the nearest health facilities to get vaccinated against smallpox and other preventative injections.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Takes a Holiday Today</h3>
<p>The Special District Court Remains Open</p>
<p>Yesterday was our country's National Day. The Public Concession Municipal Council took a holiday as usual. Because yesterday was a Sunday, the council is taking a make-up holiday today. All criminal prosecution cases to be handed over to the Special District Court by the police will be suspended and handed over tomorrow as usual. However, the Special District Court will remain open as usual today.</p>
<p>The silver and money industry will continue to be closed today due to the make-up holiday for Sunday and will resume business tomorrow (the 12th). The Jianghai Customs has resumed operations today and will close customs as usual. All departments of the post office have also resumed operations today. In addition, the Gold and Drug Bureau will continue to handle deposits, withdrawals, and payments as usual today.</p>
<h3>Brief Comments</h3>
<p>— Phase</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, there have been more than ten engagement and marriage advertisements in the newspapers every day. Yesterday, on Double Tenth Festival, there was an even more spectacular showing. There were more than thirty engagement and marriage advertisements. It was very lively. Therefore, my friend said that the enemy's use of force against us this time has at least two good phenomena: one is to promote national unity, and the other is to promote family unity. This was originally a brilliant argument. Amidst the sound of artillery fire, engagement and marriage are particularly busy. Naturally, they have their reasons for being busy. I do not object to them. The ancients had the high-minded saying, "With the national crisis not yet over, how can we make a home?" I will not sing this tune for these people. I only hope that they do not forget the soldiers fighting bravely on the front lines and the distressed refugees and soldiers wounded in the rear. They should save some of the money for their weddings and make patriotic charitable acts.</p>

<h3>Enemy Warships Bomb Hong Kong Fishing Boats - British Government Will Seriously Intervene</h3>
<p>Hundreds of Fishermen Are Missing - Fishing Boats Sunk and Burned - Hong Kong Authorities Report to the British Government</p>
<p>Hong Kong correspondence: Enemy warships have been harassing the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong for nearly a month. Although enemy soldiers have been constantly spying on various coastal areas, intending to land, they have all been met with head-on attacks by our defending troops. The enemy has not been able to achieve its ambitions. Therefore, enemy warships continue to patrol various coastal areas, wantonly harassing unarmed ships, especially harming fishermen who make a living by fishing on the sea and have no ability to resist. Their methods are extremely cruel. In the past twenty days or so, fishing boats fishing overseas from Hong Kong have been unable to avoid encountering enemy warships, being bombarded, burned, and killed by various means. Even the very few fishermen who are lucky enough to survive will be bankrupt. After these incidents occurred frequently, the Hong Kong police authorities advised Hong Kong fishing boats not to venture beyond Hong Kong's territorial waters to fish. In order to avoid danger, many fishermen have also voluntarily stopped going to sea, preferring to stop their work. However, when their hands stop, their lives are greatly affected. If this continues, it will be difficult for them to last long. Therefore, this matter has become a serious problem. The attitude of the Hong Kong government towards the infringement of Hong Kong fishing boats by Japanese warships is even more concerning to the general public. The reporter specifically visited Dr. Lo Yuk-ho to ask for his opinion. Dr. Lo replied, "Regarding the fishing boat victim incident, this issue is extremely important because it is related to Hong Kong's food and the livelihoods of over ten thousand fishermen in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government is extremely concerned about this matter, so it has already asked the British Court to seriously intervene, hoping that there will be good results soon." According to Dr. Lo, the British government authorities will make a statement soon. As for the issue of rescuing fishermen's livelihoods, it is reported that a certain fishermen's organization has prepared a plan and submitted it to the government for review. If it is deemed feasible, it will be approved for implementation, so that Hong Kong fishermen will not sit and wait for death due to the infringement of enemy warships.</p>
<p>Enemy warships have been bombarding unarmed fishing boats outside Hong Kong waters for days. On September 27, the German mail ship "Neuholland" rescued ten shipwrecked fishermen en route from Kobe to Hong Kong. Their fishing boats had all been sunk by enemy submarines. After the ship arrived in Hong Kong, it sent the refugees to Kwong Wah Hospital for accommodation. Among them, three had suffered injuries that had not yet healed. Each had been drifting in the water for several days, relying on holding onto planks to avoid drowning. According to one of them, Li Huahao, he was a fisherman from Hong Kong. He went out to sea to fish with his father on fishing boat number 3409. There were twelve boats in total, each carrying more than thirty people, all of whom were killed by enemy warships. Only these ten survived. They sailed to the waters near the Cape D'Aguilar Lighthouse around 9:00 AM on September 22, when they suddenly encountered an enemy submarine about 400 yards away. The submarine flew an enemy flag on its mast. After seeing them, it immediately opened fire. His fishing boat was the first to be hit and sunk. The people on board fled in all directions. At that time, the enemy warship kept firing. The accompanying boats sank one after another. One of them had been hit but was still able to sail away. The enemy warship did not notice. It was not until 3:40 AM on the 27th that they were rescued. On the 28th, a fisherman named Lin Zhu reported to the police that on the morning of the 19th of this month, his fishing boat was sailing back to Hong Kong, accompanied by eleven others. On the morning of the 30th, they encountered an enemy submarine with ten enemy soldiers on deck. They opened fire, and his fishing boat was the first to be hit and sunk, killing one boatman and injuring two others. At that time, he and nine others clung tightly to the broken boat and let it drift until they were rescued by another fishing boat in Pinghai. His nephew's fishing boat was also sunk, and all twenty-eight people on board drowned. The fishing boats and populations of others, such as Lin Fudi, were also unable to escape. The reported losses are more than ten thousand yuan per boat.</p>
<p>On September 24, Hong Kong fisherman Guo Zhi drove a single-masted fishing boat to fish in the Lingdingyang waters when he was suddenly forced to stop by an approaching Japanese destroyer. The destroyer lowered its launch, which sailed alongside the fishing boat. There were twenty-four Japanese naval soldiers on the launch, led by an officer. For some unknown reason, they opened fire with dozens of shots at the fishing boat from a distance of 400 yards. Fortunately, the fishermen on board quickly took cover and were not injured. After the launch docked near the fishing boat, the Japanese naval soldiers swarmed aboard, intimidating the fishermen with guns and bayonets. After thoroughly searching the entire boat and finding nothing, they threw four old-fashioned gunpowder cannons and forty pounds of gunpowder into the sea and looted the only forty Hong Kong dollars on the boat. Before leaving, they destroyed the mast and sails of the fishing boat. The unfortunate fishing boat did not repair the sails until the Japanese warship had gone far away. It hurried back to Hong Kong and reported the situation it encountered in the Lingdingyang waters to the authorities. In addition, there were four other reports to the police. The first concerned a total of ten boats that were wrecked near Waglan Island at 8:30 AM on September 23. Of all the fishermen, only thirty-two fishermen from Lin Rongsheng's boat safely arrived in Hong Kong. The rest are currently missing. The second occurred in Junk Bay, where a total of nine boats were wrecked, with approximately one hundred and fifty people missing. More than twenty people were rescued and returned to Hong Kong. The third involved the boats of the brothers Huang Demao and Huang Debao, which were wrecked in Shilou in Shanwei on the 26th, killing twenty fishermen and leaving four survivors. The fourth occurred in Jie Shi, where the number of boats wrecked at the same time is unknown. Among them, Feng Lian, the boat owner of Hong Kong fishing boat number 611HW, and twenty others, and Feng Jinsheng, the boat owner of boat number 1822HW, survived and came to Hong Kong. According to the "Gold Mountain" ship, which arrived in Hong Kong from Shan'ao on the 28th, passengers witnessed two fishing boats still burning near Cheung Chau in the vicinity of Wanshan Islands.</p>
<p>According to news from the "Hong Kong Telegraph," enemy submarines have destroyed many fishing boats recently, some of which are registered in Hong Kong. Therefore, it is not difficult to cause political negotiations. The newspaper also quoted sources from the government as saying that the Director of Marine, Mr. Newboult, has reported all the circumstances of the fishing boat disasters to the British government. People in the Colonial Secretary's Office said that although it is difficult to predict what steps the government will take now, they believe that the Hong Kong government will forward the report to the British Foreign Office and ask for instructions on how to respond.

<p>Wartime Youth, Issue 10</p>
<h3>To the Youth</h3>
<p>— Lao Yu</p>
<p>Youth is the cornerstone of the country and the lifeline of the nation! Therefore, they occupy a very important position in the entire nation. Today, when the survival of the country and the rise and fall of the nation are decided in an instant, the responsibility of the youth is of course even greater!</p>
<p>A full-scale war of resistance has begun. If we do not serve the country and society now and rise up to participate in the work of resisting the enemy, then if the country is destroyed, I am afraid that it will be impossible to contribute to the country, right?</p>
<p>Youths! Rise up! Quickly dedicate our skills and unleash our strength to serve the country; dedicate everything we have to the country to consolidate the front of the War of Resistance!</p>
<p>We must remember that this war of resistance is a war of resistance for the entire nation and a war of resistance for all mankind. For the sake of the country, for the sake of the nation, and for the sake of mankind, we must strive for "the final victory."</p>
