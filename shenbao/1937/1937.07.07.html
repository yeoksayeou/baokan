<p>何應欽開會詞原文</p>
<p>［重慶］何部長六日晨十一時在川康軍事整理委員會開會詞、原文如次、各位同志、今天川康軍事整理委員會開幕、本已因為整軍為軍政部之職責所在、所以奉到國府及蔣委員長命令以後、於百忙之中、特與顧主任相偕趕來渝域參加．劉主任雖然久病新愈、亦與各位委員如期前來出席、因此機會、遂得大家把唔一當、對於川康整軍實施之方法與步驟共相切磋、共相琢磨、務使旣定之方案、能夠達到完全實施、這一點、本已覺到非常愉快、並且應該先向劉主任和諸位同志、表示感謝的、說到整軍問題、這是我們國家統一完成以後一個項重要的工作、同時也可以說必須澈底完成整軍工作、而後國家真正的統一纔可以得到、我們試看一看、世界的大陸軍國、如蘇俄只有正規軍及民軍基幹部隊約六十九厲人、編為正規步兵師三十五個師、騎兵師十五個師、法國四十五萬五千人、編為步兵師二十五個師、騎兵五師二旅、德國四十五萬人、編為三十六個師、意大利國約三十萬人、編為步兵師三十一個師、輕快師二個師、阿爾不斯旅三個旅、日本約二十五萬人、編為十七個師、（共步兵七十個團）各國常備兵額至多不過幾十萬人、一旦對外戰事、以這幾十萬的兵員為基幹、召集預備兵後備、編成所需要之兵力、其戰鬥力可以維持到幾年、以與敵人决最後的勝負、這就是各國實行徵兵制度、有預備後備兵可以召集補充的緣故、决不像我國平時養兵兩百多萬人的常備兵、而因組織不嚴密、指揮不統一、一旦國家對外有事這兩百萬的兵員、還未必能完全使用到前綫去、縱然能有三分之二可以使用、但是一旦傷亡疾病消耗以後、便沒有後備預備兵來補充、同時因為量多而質不精、所以我們一師人的力量．還不及列强一旅人的力量、譬如淞滬長城諸役、敵我的兵力、差不多是口與一之比、但是還不能取勝、這完全是多而不精的故緣、國家平時花了很多的軍費來養這兩百萬的兵員、竟不能盡保國衛民的責任、這是多麼危險的事、這是我們軍人多大恥辱、我們為欲完成國防必要的軍備、使戰鬥的兵役、可以源源補充、則不能不實行徵兵度制、為要增强我們軍隊的戰鬥力、尤不能不首先整軍、使軍隊的編制人事經理敎育訓練指揮系統完全統一於中央、又我們軍費的預算、每年多至數萬萬元、但是這數萬萬元的軍費、僅足維持官兵最低的生活、而兵器裝備的充實、一點也談不到、更說不上補充新式的兵器裝備了、我們要使全國的軍隊、一律國軍化、現代化、能夠担負國防的任務、應付現代的戰爭、尤其不能不普遍的整軍、節省不急的經費、來充實新銳的器械、增加特種兵、所以自從廿五年度起、軍政部即已遵照蔣委員長核定之整軍原則、開始進行整軍的工作、並已先從中央直屬部隊着手辦起、計一年半的時間、已調整了幾十個師、預擬循序漸進、將全國軍隊一律國軍化現代化、凡經整理的部隊、即列為國防軍的基幹、、肩負國防上的重大責任辦理以來、一切均很順利、而且著有成效、本年二月中旬、五屆三中全會開會、本已將蔣委員長栽定之國軍整理原則提出報告、此項原則、計有五點、第一、統一編制、現行編制、計有六種之多、衡以現代作戰上之需求、及裝備上之可能與調整、實施容易計、以甲乙兩種編制統一之、（從略）第二、减少大單位、充實小單位、（從略）第三、增加部隊戰鬥力、（從略）第四、經常費不增加、就各師原有經費範圍、將其編成、酌予縮减編制、重加整理提高官兵待遇、以能發國難餉章為主、使編制與經費適合、不另增多經費、而能達到整理之目的、第五、人事．經理．完全照法規辦理、如各部隊軍官佐之任官任職、職期調任、以及懲獎退役等、須按人事法規之規定、尤其關於官佐任免遷調務須呈請中央核定、不得自行委派、或先委後報、又各師有委任經理者、須逐漸改為實費經理、勵行派員點名發餉、實施年度與臨時會計檢查、編定預算、掃除已往包辦侵蝕之弊、此項原則、旣經中央决議通過、全國軍隊之整理、即係依據此項原則辦理、川康為國防根據地、川康人民的物質、又極優良極富於國家民族的觀念、這幾年來、川康的軍人對於國民革命的工作、曾經有過不少的貢獻、極大的努力、惟因過去歷史的關係、很多的部隊、對於大的單位一天一天的擴充、增加多量的徒手兵、對於兵器裝備等等、未能充實、可以說有很多是歡戰前列强所不用的、以川康軍隊的數量來講、曾經呈報中央有案的、共為八個軍轄、二十六個師、九個獨立旅、總計步兵團一百七十一團、若以團為基準來比較、竟有日本全國軍隊數量的二倍半之多、以四川省來養這樣龐大的軍隊、自無怪主質量之難於充實、故川康軍隊之必須整理、已為川康將領一致的要求、而其動機實始於本年三月二十日左右、劉主席派鄧秘書長和盧廳長代表到京的時候、彼時行營賀代主任也在南京、大家見面之後、談到國家統一的問題、談到充實國防力量的問題、更談到全國各地方軍隊國軍化的問題、因而感覺到川康軍隊有急需提前整理之、必要、當時便由本已擬定幾點意見、請鄧秘書長等轉達劉主任、藉供參考、幾點意見中、最重要的一點、便是認為四川乃國防唯一的根據地、希望今後中央與地方精誠團結、打成一片、以樹復與民族的基礎、最好做到川康軍國軍化、劉主任對於本已貢獻的意見、非常虛懷採納、隨後根據這點意見、一再往返商討、並呈經蔣委員長核定、最後纔有川康整軍方案的正式决定、此方案係由軍政部於六月二十二日電達劉主任、接着又分電各軍長、劉主任當於六月二十五日電復委員長、表示敬謹接受、各軍長亦先後電復、一致表示擁護、劉主任與各位軍長公忠為國的精神、使人深深的敬佩、方案原文、諸位都已見過、現在不必重述、此次會議之使命、即在根據這個方案來研討實施的辦法、茲於會議開慕之時、特將本己所希望於此次會議者兩點述之如左㊀此次會議主要目的、在謀川康整軍之澈底施行、換言之、即在謀川康軍之澈武國軍化、希望各位不要客氣的、將軍隊現狀與個人意見口頭或書面充分說明、以作研討之參考、俾能决定一個盡善盡美的實施步驟與方法、㊁此次會議期限甚短、而整軍期限亦在方案中明白規定、各位所有意見及請求事項的標準、應就方案原則以內、事實財力所許可者、酌量提出、總期於决定後、即能見諸實行、蓋本會重在研究實行之方法、而不空談理論、或提出離事實過遠之請求與意見、希望各位利用這點短少的時間、發抒精辟獨到的意見總之要使川康所有的軍隊、－律加以澈底整理、成為現代化的國家軍隊、一律由中央指揮調遣、以應國防的需要、這纔算達到我們整軍的真正目的最後兄弟還有幾點意思、要附帶報告者、第一、我們的整軍、是以充實國防力量為着眼點、而普編實施的整軍、是要把過去歷史不相同編制餉章不劃一的各地方的軍隊、一律國軍化、而不是如一般人所揣測的編遣或裁兵、更不會由中央另派人員加入各部隊云、故整軍的結果、不惟各部隊的力量不會减少、而且整個的力量、旣有增加充實、第二、經常費、仍照原有預算範圍、加以整理、並須切實節省不急需之經費、以作提高官兵待遇、及補充兵器被服農具之用、第三各部隊如果有被編餘的官兵、除老弱殘疾者外、中央亦必設法安頓、或使之入官受訓、或使屯墾實邊、决不使其生話無着、而感受流離失所之苦、第四、中央整軍完全是站在国家的立场、為地方解除困难、為各將領分担责任、－切悉秉公正和平的態度來办理、决沒有絲毫成見存乎其間、但是凡屬辦理一樁什麼事、總不免有極少數的人受奸人的利用、不問明事實真相、便將用盡種種方法、挑撥離間、其用意不外是阻撓事體的成功、使國家永遠不進步、永遠不統一、這一點望諸位同志要嚴切注意防範、一面更要本着我們共信互信的精神、平心靜氣、開誠布公、來商一個行得通辦得好的步驟與辦法、絕不要隨便輕聽這種人的播弄、致使大家一片忠貞、為國為民的孤詣苦心、或竟付諸流水、使國家民族復興的大業、不能迅速完成、這一點、是本已是試擎懇切的希望、希望大家要互相留意、互相勉勵、並且將來開完會議回到部隊去的時候、也要把這種意思、詳詳細細的對着官兵加以解釋說明、讓大家深切明瞭中央整軍的意義、共同向着光明的大道前進、（六日中央社電）</p>
<p>副主委劉湘之演詞</p>
<p>［重慶］劉湘六日晨在川康軍事整理委員會致詞、原文如下、何部長．顧主任．各位軍長師長、各位官長、今天是川康整軍會議開始的第一天、所有關於整軍的問題和辦法、業經何部長詔示明白、個人本來沒有話再講、不過川康整軍非常重要所以本人在今天開會時候、有幾點簡單的理由向各位報告一下㊀川康整軍原則、早已由中央規定、川康各級將領一致復電敬謹接受、本人雖因病體初愈、恐途中不勝跋涉之勞、但因整軍會議的重要、必得親自到重慶來參加、使個人對於整軍之順利進行、稍有裨益、我感覺得這次川康整軍一事、是國家必然的要求、同時就我們國家的觀點上看來、覺得國家種種力量都不能增進、我們軍人是負有極大責任的、這次本人與各將領電復中央接受整軍原則、完全是為國家的福利、和擁護領袖的誠意、但有了這種誠意的表現、必須要有實行的方法、假如沒有一個適當的切實的方法、不能貫澈、或者不能如預期做到、那就失了這次會議的意義、有負領袖對我們的願望、所以本人此次抱病赴會、祇期會議、討論的事情、達到順利進行、㊁整軍的意義、當在我們能貫澈預期的實行、就整軍方法看來、最重要的是整軍後之善後問題、各軍按照新編制之規定、編遣的官兵必定有的、我們旣已接受整、軍原則、但要有好的方法、所以在整軍會中認為必須研究的、是今後編餘官兵安插問題、這是本人今天要說的第二個意義、以上兩點意義、就是本人接受整軍原則以後的希望、如果對於第二點意義裏頭有了適當的方法、我們相信整軍絕無困難、一定可以順利進行、按期實現、此次何部長來渝主持本會、我們得以隨時秉承何部長的意旨去參酌地方情形、共同商討、個人不但要貢獻意見、就是參加的各軍師長和各委員、也要盡量貢獻意見、兄弟昨天到達重慶時、對於一切的</p>

<h3>開展中之川省局面</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>川康軍整會議。已於昨日在渝開幕。主任委員何應欽。副主任委員顧祝同劉湘。皆先期蒞止。主持會務。各整委如劉文輝•鄧錫侯•楊森•潘文華•賀國光•夏斗寅輩。並以方面大員。襄茲盛舉。集袍澤於一堂。賡沆瀣之同調。歷來川中將領宏開之會議從未有如斯之整齊嚴肅者。預計討論所及。必多蓋籌盛猷。不特整軍方案。克期賓施。川局更新亦興有望。吾人所以不惜據滿腔之熱誠以注視此會議前途之推移。</p>
<p>整軍方案之初經提出也。函使紛馳。徵詢意見。春雲乍展。陰影頻投。誠以川事錯綜。匪易猝理道途遼迢諸多隔閡藉令有不逞者。簸弄其間幾使人不信茲事之遂能就緒。迨夫商洽漸臻具體。各方表示擁護。國府且明令發表川康軍整委員。擬定該委員會組織大綱。迄於目前。中央大員。款段入川。正式會議。如期召集。而吾人逾分之惶慮。亦遂得驅遣於無形。蓋在何顧抵渝之先。儘多樂觀空氣之彌漫。容有中途翻悔之餘地在會議召開之日。已達實施方案之階段。當無抵觸原則之可能。吾人所引為欣慰者此其一。何應欽於下機伊始。發表書面談話。鄭重聲明整軍之意義。祇在充實軍隊之質量。實際人數旣未减少。經費亦不短絀分文。一部編餘官長。另有安頓辦法。中央决不插置人員。所與前不同者。編整後之編制•人事•經費•敎育•等。直隸於中央而已。蓋在劉湘以外之諸將領。或有不甚瞭解整軍之動機者。旣患部屬之遭裁汰復慮權位之受牽製。武人頭腦不善分析。一涉疑猜易啟誤會。今何氏就其所旁皇者。先為闡明一切。必能使諸將領釋然於懷。咸團奮發則會議席上。宜無若何扞格之處。吾人所引為欣慰者。此其二。</p>
<p>關於整軍得失。吾人前已著評論列。今茲就川言川。頗覺本屆會議之結果。有足使川局轉人更新之途徑者。蓋川中軍人之各樹壁壘。迭相殘殺。久已形成割裂紛亂之局面。人民由是而敝。田土由是而瘠。省庫由是而匱乏。元氣由是而斲喪。一至災饉荐臻。遂至無法自存。今藉各方將領聚晤一室之便。正宜及時懺悔。切實反省。互捐成見。協謀提携。竊謂一切戾氣之釀成。半由隔閡所召致。果能開誠布公。常而溝通。未有不足以消釋前嫌者。矧常整編之後。已無門戶可言。同屬國軍。應思共存。川省號稱天府。物產充軔。礦藏饒足。培植開發。祇待人為。如何利用軍隊之助力。圖川局之復興。極宜於此次會議中。加以深切之考量也。</p>

<p>［東京］滿鐵公司因受資金缺乏之束縛、故進行各項新計劃之企業、遭遇極大困難、自今年起凡有能力投資滿鐵者、均不表示踴躍、故上半年滿鐵僅能發行債劵二千五百萬圓、滿鐵上半年中僅賴此款、及日政府所付該公司之股款二千萬圓從事活動、滿鐵為實現下半年各項所計劃之企業起見在七月中需款二千萬圓、八月一千萬圓、九月二千萬圓、共為五千萬圓、滿鐵現正與銀團談判、俾獲得上述款項、並力圖借貸一千萬圓以應急耑、惟銀團顯然表示不願再以借款借給滿鐵、故談判如何進行、殊值得注目也云（六日中央社電）</p>

<h3>記國際美術工藝博覽會（中）</h3>
<p>— 孝可</p>
<p>現在我們把法國之部的建築，分為：專門的•區域的•與殖民地的三組，共有廳樓大厦二百三十六座，因篇幅有限，祇能述其大槪，現在選其重要者，略述一二：</p>
<p>專門組有：</p>
<p>鐵路大厦，現代美術大厦（建築堅固，预備保存），印刷出版業大厦，民衆敎育大厦，科學發明大厦，無綫電大厦，旅行大厦，商船大厦，航空大厦，報館，酒館，衛生館，等…</p>
<p>民衆敎育大厦——位於Champ-de-Mars.內分初級與高級敎育，職業敎育等組•第一層是代表兒童學校，初小，高小，師範等七萬二千學校。陳列有建築的新式小學的模型甚多，對於此種改進，自十年來已費去五十萬萬法郎。高級敎育，則陳列有法國文化上著名的建築物模型，如：凡爾賽的國立圖書館，瑪德里的Casa　Velas　quez，朗西的大學區，里昂的新護上學校，尚有歷年來文學家在大學時代的手跡。高級敎育是沒有空間與時間的限止，從同一階層，由初級敎育的繼續，而引入各種智識的門戶。凡關心敎育事業者，此處不可不參觀也。</p>
<p>科學發明大厦——顧名思義，就知道在這大厦內，陳列的東西，都是表示歷年來的各種新發明，應用到現代生活中的過程。我們知道：倘使沒有伏爾脫，安培的發明，電氣的應用，就不像現在的廣大了。沒有拉瓦節的發明，化學工業，也不會有今日的發展。單就生物組中的植物學來說，主持的是勃賴林罕敎授，在博覽會期間，對於一切花卉，順時序的向觀衆用科學原理指示一切。每日下午五時，更利用電影以普及民衆的科學常識。還有法國五十年來，對於葡萄種植的改進。植物病害學亦保留有大部份地位。更有一部，則為各種奇怪的倭種植物，（所謂日本式花園是也），證明今後的城市住戶，均能在家中安設一如大公園佈置的小型花園。這不是科學應用到美術工藝上，發生了聯繫麼？</p>
<p>婦孺家庭館——對此種重要的社會問題，博覽會主持者，也並沒有疏忽遺忘，一共建築了七座館屋，凡法國對於孩童婦女的一切社會慈善事業，均代表在內。關於婦女職業的傾向介紹等問題，均能代為答復介紹。尚有小型公園一，內有關於兒童的一切娛樂組織。</p>
<p>航空大厦——位在Invalides廣塲與其車站前，長一百八十公尺，闊三十六公尺，前部凸出成圓錐形而透明，內陳列有法國最新的軍用飛機：Nieuport　761,Hanriot　220,　Potez　63,Morane　405,Hanriot　782與Breguet　730一到夜間，能從外望到龐大的飛機黑影。大厦的頂層，為一大飯廳，由大西洋航務公司的諾曼地大郵船承辦。屋外附設有小型航空傘降落塔一座，高六十五公尺，有安全設備，為遊覽者初次試降之用。在博覽會期間。關於航空的競賽，有：七月十四日的航空大檢閱，八月二十九日的民衆航空日，十月三日的國際航空速率與競技賽。</p>
<p>法國著名的國立織錦地毯廠Gobelin，自兩年來即開始預備，織成名貴畫片一百五十方公尺，參加展覽。此廠設自十五世紀，年出織錦六十五方公尺，每一技術員，每年祇能織成一方公尺。此次陳列者內中有五公尺二十寸長四公尺闊的大織錦“和平”一幅，展覽後將為國聯新廈裝飾之用。</p>

<h3>蘇俄文豪高爾基致孫中山先生函</h3>
<p>精神上是弟兄方法上是同志　希望共同努力消滅人間仇恨</p>
<p>六月十八日為蘇聯大文豪高爾基逝世週年紀念日，蘇聯全國舉行盛大的記念。蘇聯報上這天發表一九一二年秋間，高爾基本人致孫中山先生函一件。當時高爾基方任“現代”報編輯，該報內闢有“國外生活”一欄，該函就登在其中，全文如下：</p>
<p>逸仙先生：</p>
<p>我是一個俄國人，方為與你同具的理想之勝利而鬥爭，這種理想無論在何處勝利，我也與你同感快樂。我恭賀你的工作底優越的成功，一切有良心的人，都對這成功注意，對於你—中國的海勾力士，感覺愉快和驚異。</p>
<p>我們俄國人也期望你已經完成的東西。我們在精神上是弟兄，在方法上是同志，可是俄國政府和它的奴隸，却把俄國人民置於中國人民之敵的地位。</p>
<p>我們社會主義者，我們深信全世界能够而且將要過着同胞式生活的人們，我們能够不管，能够放任貪婪愚蠢的人們、促進種族間仇視的發展，從而也許會使社會主義的前途，遭遇黑暗而堅固的墻壁嗎？</p>
<p>正相反，我們將用我們的全力，去破壤我們敵人的企圖，世界上一切善者的敵人，準備熄滅太陽，以便進行其黑暗貪婪的伎倆，散播世界間的仇恨，壓迫人民的敵人底企圖。</p>
<p>我們社會主義者必須儘可能地常常宣佈世界上存在着有政府間的仇恨，而不應有人民間的仇恨，這種仇恨乃是統治階級正在喚起的。逸仙先生，我懇請你關於下列的題目寫一篇文章：中國人一般地和個別地對於歐洲資本之侵略企圖的態度如何，對於俄國資本家和俄國政府之舉動的態度如何？這些舉動是什麼，它們遇到貴國人民怎樣的反對？你如果沒有時間自己寫，則請轉託你的朋友寫，你自己校正一下，寫時請用任一種歐洲文字，寄到我的通訊處。</p>
<p>我之請求你這件事，是因為俄國人必須從誠實的中國人知道中國的再生，而不能從替資本主義服務的歐洲新聞記者去知道。</p>
<p>我見過你在“一個社會主義者的活動”中所寫的論文，讀過你的雜記。我深深地欣佩你，確信你會願意答復我的請求。高爾基在意大利卡普里城十月二十八日，（塔斯社）。</p>

<h3>十年來上海市政進展之諸種因素</h3>
<p>— 張羣</p>
<p>自一八四二年南京條約成立以來，上海即於其翌年按約闢為商埠，於是海澨僻縣，一躍而為全國對外貿易之中心。後值太平軍興，李鴻章以上海為根據地，戡定全吳，論者以為上海開港而還，旣擅梯航之利，即為財賦所萃，籌餉籌械，莫不易於為力，李氏之克奏厥功，實由於是。自是上海常以一隅之地，左右全局。一九一○年革命之役，漢陽旣陷，南京未復，首義之武昌，勢成坐困；卒以上海宣告獨立，轉移全國之視聽奠定民國之基礎。一九二七年國民革命之役，亦以上海底定，遂成奠都南京統一全國之局。重以中外雜處，接觸西洋文明較早，故以文化敎育而論，亦往往得風氣之先，足以冠冕全國。上海地方無論在經濟上，政治上，軍事上，乃至文化敎育上，動關全局此，而數十年來，在政制上之建置，初未能與之相應。清季僅蘇淞太兵備道駐此。一九一○年革命之際，陳英士先生開府於此，稱滬軍都督，惟草創伊始，名位雖隆，規模未備，旋即撤銷。一九一二年以後，設鎮守使，別有海軍司令部，負陸海治安之責。其對外折衝，則有特派江蘇交涉員駐此。至市政設施，僅有工程局隸於鎮署而已，及一九二六年始設市政督辦，雖職權較崇，規模較宏，而上海為江蘇省之一行政區，則自若也。及一九二七年國民政府成立，始設上海市政府，在行政系統上，與省政府同為直隸中央之地方政府。十年以來，遭時多故，而各項建設，均能順流並進，其詳具見於歷年行政統計及報告，試一翻檢，成績昭著。夷考其由，蓋有四焉：溯市府建置之初，黃膺白先生以革命先俊，首膺中長之選，創制立法，期以宏遠。繼之者為張伯璇先生，以實心行實政，民被其澤，迄今不忘。予以菲材，驂靳其間，在任三年，愧無建樹；雖大上海計劃適於是時確定實施，然創議在前，經營在後，予不過啟其端。其他市行政，亦無非隨時推進，免於落後而已，其後吳鐵城先生繼長滬市，適值一二八之變，上述計畫自不免大受影響，然仍能循序漸進，今雖觀成有待，而規模已畢具矣。良以滬市地位重要，自國府定都南京以來，更有類乎扶風馮翊，拱衛首都。歷任市長自無不兢競業業，以期仰副中央之倚畀，滬市市政之進展，此實為“重要因素，事實所在，予不得引嫌而略之也。其次，上海為萬國衣冠所萃，市民耳濡目染，接受現代智識之機會自較內地民衆為多，一般文化水準，因而提高。又與各國僑民接觸旣多，隨時隨地，不免發生國力强弱之感，因而國家觀念特為發達。自清季以還，上海市民同情本黨努力革命者，實居最大多數，蓋深感國家自由平等之重要，認為惟有革命方可求得之也。然一九一二年二次革命失敗時，上海市民尤寄與本黨以最深厚之同情。洎市府成立，對於市政建設，多方盡力協贊，以予之體騐，上海市政之進展，得力於市民之合作者，至巨且大。今後推進市政，仍必以此種合作為其重要因素，無可疑也。又次，市政府承中央之指示，得市民之協贊，同時又有地方黨部及軍事機關與之左提右挈。十年以來，數遭邅迍，黨政軍三方始終水乳交融，用能艱難共濟，雖有一二八之浩刧，而地方秩序不因而紊亂，建設計畫不因而停頓。數年之間，竟於殘壘廢壕之上，建成今日嶄新之市中心區，是則黨政軍三方一心一德之成果也。又次，市府同人自各局局長以次，大抵學有專長，且富於行政經騐，對於上海市政，均認為一種事業，休戚與共。一掃從來官僚習氣，雖有較高之地位，較優之待遇，亦不願舍此他去。以是今俞代市長鴻鈞等，皆久於其位，用能人盡其才，才盡其用；行政效率亦因以提高。市長雖有迭更，而幹部健全，足為推進市政之中心力量。以予觀之，組織之幹部化，行政之科學化，實為滬市府之特色；至於同寅協恭，猶餘事耳。本年七月七日，適值上海市政府成立十周年紀念，輯行特刋；來徵予文，予因述十年來上海市政進展諸種因素以紀之，念締造之艱難，信衆警之易舉，十年	此，百載可期，藉都市之繁昌，躋國家於强盛，不禁跂予望之矣。</p>
<h3>上海市的回顧與展望</h3>
<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>一，上海與本人的關係上海市對我個人有着特別深切的關係，現在我雖然已經離開了上海市，可是我對於他，還是感覺到有非常親切的意味，以及無限深遠的關懷。這是因為本人在上海市供職的時間，經歷了五年以上，可以說是本人為黨國在一個地方工作，與一個地方的同志共事最久的一個時期。在個人的生命史上，上海市是占有很重要的地位，而且在上海主政的期間，恰巧又遭逢上海市設市以來的一大刦難。一二八的戰事爆發，給予上海市莫大的打擊和損害。在戰時的維持鎮靖，撫輯救濟；在戰後的休養生息，復舊建新，其間眞可以說是殫心竭力，艱苦備嘗。因此上海市對我格外留有深刻的印象。</p>
<p>這次上海市政府舉行十週紀念盛典，以有這樣深切關係的我，格外感到愉快欣慰，其歡忻鼓舞的熱烈情緒，實非言可喻。</p>
<p>古語說，愛之深，不覺望之切，這句話，正足以說出我對於上海市的感覺，我受上海市，因此我對上海市的屬望，或許也較普通人更為殷切，現在趁這個機會，除了特誌慶賀之忱以外，并略述我對於上海市的祝望，作為我貢獻上海市的一些禮物。</p>
<p>二，上海市的重要性</p>
<p>如果我們把上海市和一個行省比較起來。雖然他的面積比較的小，他的人口，也比較的少，但是他的地位，却頗為重要。而他的重要性，自一二八戰後，隨着國際鬥爭的尖銳化，又一天一天的增加起來。上海市的地位，所以比中國任何部份重要的原因，卽在於上海市為全中國的門戶。上海市之安危，就是全國之安危，上海市的一舉一動，都可以與整個民族，整個國家發生很重大的影響。</p>
<p>回憶過去，我到上海來，主持市政，不久就發生上海戰事。上海戰事，為上海全市中外人士所夢想不到的一件事。上海有國際間非常複雜關係，互相錯綜制衡，因之不但上海市民夢想不到上海會發生這次大戰，就是上海以外的任何地方的人，也意料不到有此國際關係的上海，會急激發生戰事。戰事發生以後，地方受極大的破壞，到今年已五年多，這五年多以來，經我們市政府全體同事，與全上海市市民，一致的努力，不但使戰區的破壞，逐漸恢復舊觀；同時我們又把市中心區建設起來。我們在上海市自有歷史以來最困難艱苦的一個時期中，能够建立起這些成績，能够收到這些結果，可說是出於大家意料之外。由於這一點，足見我們祇要去做，祇要去努力，不要去問進行的困難如何，不要去問將來的收獲如何，我們能努力多少，去做多少，將來終必有多少的結果。</p>
<p>在過去五六年來艱難困苦的時期中，為什麼我們大家不但能够拿連續不斷發生的困難，一件一件的一次一次的克服；並且在社會方面，在文化方面，在經濟方面，還稍稍有了一點成就呢？這都是我們中央政府的指導，地方各界的贊助和全體市民的努力，有以致此的。但是我們在差堪自慰之餘，却仍須加緊努力。在消極方面，我們應使五六年來，上海市三百五十萬市民的心血所結成的一點基礎，能够維持下去；在積極方面，許多未竟的建設，尤應繼續不斷的建設下去。而上海市又是我們首都的一個門戶，如何使上海可以當得起做我們首都的門戶；我恐怕在這個環境當中，此後的工作，且過去更來得艱鉅</p>
<p>三，對於上海市的祝望</p>
<p>關於此後市政上應注意的問題，現在我願本我感想所及，提供數點：</p>
<p>甲，治安問題</p>
<p>第一是治安問題。上海治安很重要，治安問題往往可以影響大局，希望上海軍警的負責同志，此後仍舊要本已往幾年的經騐，對於上海市的治安問題，要切實加以注意，同時更需要各方面和衷合作，共保安寗。過去上海的治安，所以不致發生問題，這可以從三種關係上來說：</p>
<p>一，黨政軍的和衷共濟上海市在這五六年來，黨政軍不但沒有隔閡，並且意見一致，和衷共濟，無論對什麼事，大家完全是共同合作，因此不論是否黨內的人，是否政府中人，關於我們黨政關係的印象，都是很好。我們不能諱言，過去有許多地方，特別是內地合黨政軍，意見不一致，不能的作，因此發生了許多意見，這是很不幸的。可是我們上海市這幾年來，大家和衷共濟，大家一致，大家合作，無論什麼事，都是開黨政軍談話會，共商進行，雖然黨政軍談話會之决議不發生法律上的效力，但我們一議决了，大家就都遵照着去做，這種黨政軍和衷共濟的關係，是很可貴的，希望此後還要繼續維持下去。</p>
<p>二，政府與地方團體的合作上海市政府與地方團體過去也很合作，什麼事都開誠布公的與大家來磋商，因為上海的一舉一動，足以影響大局，所以政府與地方團體，應該上下一致和衷共濟。上海歷年來所以能平安無事，於此亦不無關係，這一點精神也希望此後還要繼續維持下去。</p>
<p>三，對於租界外人友好關係之維持上海市有兩個租界上海市內有四五十個國家的外國人僑居在裏面，這四五十國的外人，彼此間的權利，往往都是互相衝突無法調和的，我們對於國際間友誼的關係，要設法維持；同時，上海市政府在上海應以主體自居，對於僑居本市的外國人，要當他們是居留的市尺，我們應該站在主人的地位，負起保護的責任，對於兩個租界，在未收回以前，我們不能不顧到事實，無謂的爭執應極力避免，務必要維持友好，合作的關係，租界方面需要市府助力的地方很多，市政府在這種特殊的情形之下，要租界共同合作地方也不少。所以市政府與兩租界的友好關係，此後還是要設法維持。</p>
<p>乙，物質建設</p>
<p>其次說到市政建設自上海戰事以後，五六年以來，上海市政府全體同人，與上海市市民所共同努力的一切精神方面的建設和物質方面的建設，雖有很多已經完成，但還有很多仍須繼續努力的，還有很多因為經費和時局的關係而沒有去做的，這些事工，都是我們上海市所需要的。希望俟將來財政充裕的時候，能够一一去做，現在就我個人記憶所及的，”各項分別提供如下：</p>
<p>一，市中心區一般的建設這一點於大上海的建設最關重要，我們在大局和財政的可能範圍以內，是要繼續的一步一步去努力的，尤其是虬江碼頭與市中心區的發展最有關係，益當促其早日完成，因為在市中心區市府與民間的投資，已達四五千萬元之鉅，所以我們不但要繼續維持下去，並目還要繼續建設，以求繁榮發展</p>
<p>二，市博物館與市圖書館市博物館與圖書館，現在雖都已成立，但是內容尚未充實，此後尚須積極改進。</p>
<p>三，平民福利事業我們過去大家抱了一個很大的宏願，要拿上海市平民的生活改善，要增進平民的福利，所以雖在則政萬分困難的時候，我們還撥了一筆款項來建築平民新村，以代替草棚，但是現在平民新村祇建築了四處，僅能解决全市草棚十分之一，不够的還很多，此後應該如何的來繼續提倡建設平民村，來改善平民生活，增進平民福利，猶待於繼續加緊努力。</p>
<p>四，其他社會事業上海市政府歷年以來，創辦了很多的文化社會事業，好像創立學校創立醫院等等，社會文化事業至為重要，現在沒有完成的，我們要完成他，例如虞洽卿先生的紀念醫院，龍華風景區王一亭先生紀念亭等等，我們在可能範圍以內，應該努力去完成他，將來還要繼續提倡這種事業。</p>
<p>我們因為時間財力有限，不能樣樣都兼籌併辦，幾年來因為要復興戰區，要建設市中心區，使我們沒有多餘的時間和財力來做別方面的事業，所以還留有不少應做而未做的工作，當然希望將來能兼籌並顧，衆廢悉舉。</p>
<p>丙，精神建設</p>
<p>以上大都是關於物質建設方面的，關於精神方面的，還有幾點：</p>
<p>一，識字敎育上海市區內差不多有四十餘萬不識字的文盲，我們舉辦識字敎育，已有兩年，僅僅敎了全數三分之以上的人，還有二十萬光景的人，在等待我們去施敎，所以本市識字敎育運動我們尚須繼續努力，以求完成，租界當所對於界內國人的文化敎育事業，向來不加注意，但是我們對於租界以內的文化敎育事業，則不能不加以注意，所以識字敎育還須向租界方面去設法推進，以期提高上海市民智識的水準。</p>
<p>二，關於學生集中訓練以往兩年，本市學生集中訓練，都在蘇州舉行，花了許多錢又感覺許多不便，所以今年在上海建築了一個營房，這個營房除了學生集中訓練以外，還可以作童子軍訓練，警察訓練，全市的校長敎職員訓練，保安隊訓練，以及公民訓練等等之用，學生集中訓練，與公民訓練，都很重要，我們要振發市民的精神，提鬼市民的智識，整飭市民的紀律，强健市民的體魄，灌輸市民軍事的普通智識，都非靠學生的集中訓練以及公民訓練不可，所以學生集中訓練，與公民訓練，此後還要十二分的注意。不要因財政困難而因噎廢食。</p>
<p>丁，經濟建設</p>
<p>一，關於農業生產方面我們此後要設法改良上海四郊農民的生產技術，增加農民的生產，改進農民的生計，以供本市的需要。上海市是有百多萬人的大都市，每天所消耗的米麥，棉花，菜蔬，瓜豆，鷄蛋以至花卉很不少，這些都是要仰給於本市的農民的。我本來有一個計劃，因為財政與時間的關係，至今沒有實踐，這個計劃就是想在市區內，譬如江灣或吳淞出錢來租一千畝地來種穀了，定一個十年計劃或五年計劃，用最新的生產方法，僱用就地的農民來種植，這一方面是生產事業，一方面也寓有敎育的意味，以改良的生產新方法來增進農民的知識，同時還可以解决一部份的失業問題，再譬如在浦東可以設一個園林，在眞如可以設一個菜圃，諸如此類我們都可以這樣做，這些都是關係生產關係敎育，關係社會的事業，過去因財政與時間的關係，還沒有着手看望，此後能够具體實現</p>
<p>二，關於財政方面幾年來雖然財政極度困難，但是所用去的錢確比往年多，所以財政方面收後總要求一個根本的辦法，財政總要有個條件，雖然不能量入為出，但也不要相差太大。此後應該如何開源節流，如何整理，亦為重要問題。</p>
<p>三，關於地政方面第一先要完成清丈，其次土地行政手續也要改善，使他簡單化。土地行政因為積習很深的緣故，恐怕一時不容易改善，但是終得加以注意而向這一方面努力的。</p>
<p>因為我對於上海市有着很深切的感情，不覺對上海市的關懷希望特別的殷切，上舉各點，都是我今春離開上海市的時候，對各位同仁的“臨別贈言”，今乘上海市十週紀念的盛典，謹把我當時的感想，憑我同憶所及，提供出來，以當賀禮，並竭誠祝禱上海市前途的光明與發展。廿六年六月廿八日於廣州</p>

<h3>上海市十年來市政之進展</h3>
<p>— 俞鴻鈞</p>
<p>昔之論為政者，注重力行，今之言行政者，首尚效率，抉因探果，雖各不同，然極其指歸則一也。上海施行市制，已歷十年，閱四市長，舉所設施，輒為中外人士所注視，雖見仁見智，評判未必盡同，但夷攷其實，則此十年中所可據為成績者，初非倖致，蓋由中央地方，維擊綦切，庶事有一貫之政策，百僚矢致之努力，用能循序程功，以迄今日。鴻鈞備員市府，於茲十稔，今值本府成立十週年紀念，爰撮舉史要，以伊各界之參考焉。</p>
<p>本市成立於民國十六年七月七日，其時國軍甫定南北，以上海地方重要，規定為特別市，直隸國民政府。第一任市長，特簡久歷樞要之黃膺白先生，在任祗兩閱月，首製本市政府組織條例，及必需之單行章則，設局分政，選賢任能，更收拾上海舊有之地方機關，如滬北工巡捐局，上海市公所，上海縣清丈局等機關，俾各改隸新局；並呈請國民政府，劃定市治區域，惟時雖極暫，然草昧經營，實已確立上海市此後發展之軌範。繼任者為張伯璇先生，一切設施，胥能根據已定之大綱原則，努力恢宏，用能將市區範圍問題，從速解决。接管上寶兩縣之市鄕，一律改稱為區，轄境擴展，數倍曩時。大上海之基礎，實奠於此，迨張岳軍先生於十八年四月繼任，即繼續努力於市政上實際之設施，興利除弊，經緯萬端，而先後緩急，無不胥當其可。舊市區之整理，旣大致就緒，乃進而規劃新市區，以期實現總理大上海之計畫。二十年七月七日，舉行市中心區市府新厦奠基典禮，今日市中心區宏壯偉大之規模，蓋胥肇端於此時也。自成立迄二十年底，凡五載，可目為上海市創制時期。</p>
<p>民國二十一年一月，吳鐵城先生蒞市長任，不兩旬，即遭慘痛之事變，於顚沛之際，一持鎮定努力於救濟事業，撫輯流亡，全活極衆，善後要政，厥惟復興戰區，特舉債以赴其事。又虞地方警力薄弱，乃於是年八月，成立保安處，以固保衛。同時並繼續進行市中心區之建設。二十二年底，市府新厦落成，翌年春，即遷入辦公，於是乃銳意策動新市區之繁榮，與社會之建設，逾年而重要建築如體育塲，博物館，圖書館，市醫院等，次第落成。二十四年之全國運動會，即在新建之體育塲舉行，一時萬流雲集，稱盛事焉。更創為强迫識字運動，朞年而掃除全市文盲之半數；建築平民新村，俾齊民得享清潔安適之居住。此外如舉行集團結婚，以示民節儉；推進新生活，以革新社會；其事迹久為各界所深悉，茲不贅述。蓋此五年中於養衛敎三者，無不殫精竭慮，兼籌並顧，第為本市財力所限，未竟之緒固正多也。此階段可目為上海市建設時期。</p>
<p>本年三月，鐵城先生奉命調粵主席，鴻鈞以疏庸暫代職務，汲深綆短，能無隕越亦惟有恪遵中央之指導，秉承歷任長官乏旣定方針，並企求全市人士之督飭協助，對於目前當務之急，如國民經濟建設，及地方自治諸要政，謹當於短時期內，悉心考求，付諸實施，冀能保持本市行政上一貫一致之精神，斯幸甚矣。</p>
<h3>上海市之社會行政</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>查民國十九年五月，國民政府公布之市組織法，其第十四條第一款規定：社會局掌理該法第八條第一款至第十款事項•此十款事項，綜合言之，曰社會行政，玆列舉如下：（一）戶口調查及人事登記事項；（二）育幼養老濟貧救災等設備事項；（三）糧食儲備及調節事項；（四）農工商集之改良及保護事項；（五）勞工行政事項；（六）造林墾牧漁獵之保護及取締事項；（七）民營公用事業監督事項；（八）合作社及互助事業之組織及指導事項；（九）風俗改良事項；（十）敎育及其他文化事項。</p>
<p>因本市設有公用局，故上述第十款民營公用事業監督事項，屬之公用局主管，第一款戶口調查及人事登記事項，為便於處事起見，亦劃歸昔日之公安局即今日之警察局掌理•至第十款敎育及其他文化事項，在二十五年十月本市敎育局與社會局合併改組以後，仍為社會局職掌之一•是以今日上海市之社會行政，殆指上述第一七兩款事項以外之八款事項而言。</p>
<p>吾人服務上海市政府，在市長指導之下，掌理本市社會行政。如上所述，社會行政事項範圍至廣，方面頗多，竟如一般人士意想中“社會”一詞之無所不包。中國方在建設近代國家之途中邁進，行政專門化之趨勢日形顯著，法令規章愈見繁密。十載以來，吾人奉行國家政策，處理地方事務，凡所措施，稍加敷陳，必致盈篇累幅，非本文所許，今請就本市社會行政事項之犖犖大者，依其性質，別為四類而一述之如左。</p>
<p>一曰農工商業行政事項。本市為全國人口最多工商業最盛之都市，然耕地仍有五十萬市畝，依農為生者計五萬四千餘戶約三十萬人，故本市農工商業之改良保護未容偏重。關於農業者，首重改良作物增加收獲，社會局於浦東設有農林塲，闢稻麥及大豆試騐區，散播優良種子，指導農民技術，預防蟲害螟災。該塲並培養大宗苗木花草，於每年造林運動宣傳週期中，廣發樹苗與市民，獎勵種植，以期調節氣候，俾益公共衛生，促成都市之田園化。社會局為提倡農家副業，特舉辦養鷄合作，先從高橋陸行兩區入手，成績尚佳。此外若厲行漁輪登記，防止外輪侵漁，研究水產經濟，指導改善漁業塲不失為農業要政。關於工業者，推行新制度量衡，已於二十年七月一日宣布本市度量衡劃一，六年以來經檢定之度量衡器約一百五十萬件，經檢查折毀之舊器，年達二千餘件，其移送法院依法處斷者尚不與焉，惜第一特區，因工部局阻撓，至今尚未能施行檢查。此外比較重要之事，如工業物品之試騐研究證明獎勵及厘訂工業品標準辦理工廠登記等是是。關於商業者，如公司登記，商號注冊，團體登記，審核業夫，調解糾紛，取締壟斷，制止投機，及編製商業金融物價統計等，皆為比較重要之事。</p>
<p>二曰勞工行政事項。自工廠法頒行之後，本市卽準備施行工廠檢查，徒以租界工廠檢查之交涉，遷延甚久，迄未解决，乃致全市檢政未能切實施行，坐令工廠災變頻仍，勞工生命，產業資本，同罹浩刧良堪浩嘆！勞工問題為現代社會問題中之重且大者，欲謀解决，首須研究事實，故社會局對於本市勞工統計之編製，致力頗多，收獲亦富。十年以來，按期編製發表者有如下列：（1）工資及工作時間統計，已出版者有“工資指數之試編”，“工資和工作時間”，“上海市之工資率”，在編印中者有“工人實際收入統計”，“本市工資制度調查”。（2）工人生活程度調查，已出版者有“上海工人生活程度”一書，對於工人家庭人口年齡性別職業分配收入來源及數額，每戶平均支出食物費衣着费住屋費等之分配，均有詳細分析。（3）工人生活費指數，自十五年起至二十年止，業經編印成書出版，自二十一年起，繼續按月編製，在報紙被露，為解决工資之依據。（4）罷工停業統計，已出版者有“近十五年來上海之罷工停業”一書，近仍按月編製發表，（5）勞資糾紛統計，自十七年至二十一年皆有專書出版，近仍繼續按月編製發表。此外如勞資爭議之調解，廠規之審核，工會之登記等，皆依中央法令或本市單行法規處理之。</p>
<p>三曰社會福利行政事項。此類事項，包括育幼養老濟貧救災之設備，糧食之儲備調節，合作社互助事業之組織指導以及風俗之改良等等，範圍旣廣，需款甚多，本市限於財力，未遑一一舉辦。譬如：育幼養老濟貧救災等事亦僅能就民間原有之準備，加以監督改善及輔助而已；糧食之調節，若疏通來源制止浪費獎勵屯積取締居奇辦理調查統計等事，社會局雖努力為之，終屬治標之策，因無力舉辦儲備，每遇糧荒，苦難應付；合作事業僅消費販賣兩種合作社辦理稍有成績，數量亦漸形發達，惟農村信用合作，雖有計劃，限於財力，未能舉辦；改良風俗若推行新生活運動，舉辦集團結婚，挽救本市頹靡之風頗著成效。</p>
<p>四曰敎育行政事項。本市敎育事業，自市政府成立以來，年有進展，其詳細情形具載市政報告及敎育統計等書，此處不能列舉。市立學校，現有中等學校所，小學校二百零一所，幼稚園所，其他附屬機關，如民衆敎育館，流通圖書館，動物園，民衆簡易體育塲，各補習學校等，推進社會敎育，效益甚顯。社會局於短期小學義務小學識字敎育三事，尤努力推進，以期掃除市內文盲；同時提倡職業敎育，以適應社會需要。此外如嚴限師資，檢定敎員，舉辦塾師訓練整頓私塾，取縮不良私校，注重敎員進修，皆在繼續進行。</p>
<p>凡上所述，胥屬本市之重要社會行政，其中關於農工商業勞工敎育文化諸事，雖以租界存在，治權不一，動輙橫遭阻梗，間或不能以行順利，然吾人奉行國策黽勉以赴十年以來，差免隕越。至地方福利諸事，惜財力所限，建樹殊少，嘉惠無多，此則檢點之餘，至感不安者也。</p>

<p>— 張定璠</p>
<p>溯民國十六年秋，余忝長滬市之命，時軍事甫定，建設未遑，勉竭駑駘，將及兩稔，深愧無所樹立，流光如駛，倐又十易寒暑矣。</p>
<p>今歲七月七日，市府適屆十週年之期，因舉行集會，輯行特刋，用資紀念，而於此檢查已往，拓展未來，意義最為重大，不以余為固陋，督文於余，余維滬市為國際著名商埠，亦國內經濟文化中心，其地位之重要，庶政之紛煩，環境之特殊，措施之困難，國人率能道之，輓近十年以還，幸市府同仁之不斷努力，全體市民之多方協助，各項建設，均有長足進步，此顯示於統計方面之圖表數字，不難覆按者也。</p>

<p>顧市政建設事業，規模綦鉅，端緒綦繁，際滋國運迍邅民生凋敝之時，若云萬𢑥同功，一時並舉，匪微力所難任，抑亦勢所不能，要在權衡重輕，酌量緩急，認定時代需要市民福利為主體，以定其程序，物質建設，固宜逐步實施，精神建設，尤屬當前急務，如新生活運動，實吾人精神動員之軸心，當向整個市民，積極推進，使樹立堅確信仰，發生偉大力量，夫如是，物質與精神互相配合，民衆與政府日益交融，行見市政進展之速度，且與駒光相競逐，則實現總理大上海計劃，將於廿週年紀念中，操其左券矣，商之盤銘曰，茍日新，日日新，又日新，余蓋不勝欣矚之至云，</p>

<h3>上海市之財政</h3>
<p>— 徐桴</p>
<p>上海為東亞通商巨埠，居全國金融重心，地位重要，環境特殊，市政建設，尤為中外觀瞻所繫，顧欲推進建設，必先充實財力，本市政府成立以來，因蘄求建設之完成、特注意財政之推進，十年之間，市庫歲入歲出，由三百餘萬元增至一千餘萬元，建設計劃之逐步實現，財政實為先驅。茲略述本市財務演進情形，為關懷市政者告：</p>
<p>本市財政之演進，過去約可分三個時期：（一）接收整理時期，（二）為逐步推進時期，（三）事變影響與善後復興時期。在市政府未成立以前，本市地方財務。甫市由前上海市公所管理，閘北由前滬北工巡捐局管理，浦東由前塘工善後局及洋涇市公所管理，財權旣不統一，措施備極紛岐，市政府成立後，由財政局先後接收前市政機關財務，合倂整理，並由市府設財政整理委員會，共策進行。各項稅捐，先後劃一辦理，市民負擔，遂獲平均。經整理之結果，十六年度歲入歲出各三百數十萬元，十六年度即各增至四百數十萬元。財政初基。於以奠定。是為接收整理時期。厥後各項捐稅，如房捐車捐船捐等，均能循執漸進，普遍增收，又於十八年發行市政公債三百萬元，除供建築市區幹道建設市中心區等用途外，並撥款創立上海市銀行，藉以調劑金融，便利社會，復將舊有路政橋路及邑廟豫團等公債整理完竣，財務更見整飭。十八年度歲入除公債外，計達六百二十五萬餘元，歲出六百十九萬餘元，十九年度歲入七百二十萬餘元，歲出則連公債項下付款共達九百五十萬餘元，均呈邁進之趨勢，是為逐步推進時期，嗣值一二八事變，蒸蒸日上之財政，遂致重受影響。雖事變敉平之後，各項稅收，經努力整理，次第恢復，但支出方面，善後救濟，與復與市區，繼續完成市中心區建設，在在均需鉅款，乃於二十一年發行災區復興公債六百萬元，二十三年繼續發行市政公債三百五十萬元；並自二十二年秋舉辦暫行地價稅，二十三年冬的增房捐車捐捐率，以應需要。比年以來，市區各項建設，逐步進展，治安方面，復添設保安團隊，又注意衛生敎育事業之推行，財政上負荷日重。二十年度以至二十四年度，市庫歲入，自七百五十餘萬元增至一千零三十餘萬元，歲出由九百五十萬元增至一千二百八十餘萬元，二十五年度截至四月底止，市庫收入計達九百九十餘萬元，支出亦達九百六十餘萬元，預計年度終了收支兩方，均將超過上年數額，於此可覘本市收入之已整理著效，而建設浩繁，財力仍苦未足，則不得不賴張羅調度，以應緩急者也。是為事變影響與善後復興時期。</p>
<p>歷年財政之演進，其概况旣如前述，至於近年財務行政之興革，舉其著者，約有下列數端：</p>
<p>（一）改善稽查制度整理稅收，首重嚴密，故稽查制度，極應重視，本局原有稽查股之設，但各稽查員向均分駐各稽徵處，逕由各該處主任指揮服務，不能盡稽查之功、爰於二十五年四月，將全局稽查職權，集中本局稽查股，並將全體稽查員，加以區別，一律調局，歸稽查股支配調遺，實行以來，對於取締漏匿，剔除中飽，頗見功效。</p>
<p>（二）改善附屬機關會計制度本局各稽徵處經收稅款，為數甚鉅，其徵解帳目，自非由局派駐會計人員，負責登記列報，不足以資稽核。爰於二十五年八月修正稽徵處章程，規定各處會計事宜，由局遴派會計人員，駐處辦理；對於本局所屬各船捐處，亦分別指定辦事員，專司會計事務，以符會計獨立之旨，而盡稽核之功。</p>
<p>（三）改善房捐徵收辦法本市房捐，向用預填實票徵收。事前塡造，手續旣繁，事後稽核，又感不便；且每季退廢票數，多至兩萬張以上，徵收員尤不無從中朦混匿報之弊。市庫損失，殊非淺鮮。為謀澈底改良，清除積弊起見，經縝密研究，呈准市府，自二十五年秋季起，探用剪數式空白收據；另造徵冊，由徵收員按冊徵捐，臨時將收據剪給捐房執。收各稽徵處則於徵收員繳款時，隨即將票款稽核清楚。實行以來，旣於退票匯款以及移甲作乙大頭小尾諸弊，防範易周；復可節省廢票之糜費；徵收效率，尤見增進。</p>
<p>總之，本市財務，在本身方面，蓋已盡量整理，顧客觀環境，逈異他市，財政推展，或不免於障礙，或有待於折衝。今後惟有仍向收支適合進途，勉力邁進，節流開源，以集中財力於建設專業。蓋大上海計劃之完成，仍有賴於財政為之前驅也。</p>

<h3>上海市之警察</h3>
<p>— 蔡勁軍</p>
<p>上海之有警察機關，始於遜清之警察總巡局。草創伊始，僅具雛形，合巡長警士，不過二百六十人而已，後雖迭經變遷，逐漸擴充，但系統紊亂，權責不清，論其性質，同時有官辦紳辦之分，按其名稱，一地有縣警商埠警之別。更於南市閘北，分設警務公所。民國二年一月，將在南市者，改稱上海商埠巡警局，在一閘北者，改稱閘北巡警局。越四閱月復併兩局，為淞滬警察廳，內部分科，外設六區署，十九分所，另轄保安警察一隊，遊巡警察四隊，水上警察偵緝隊各一隊，合計達三千餘人。翌年，又改稱督辦淞滬水陸警察署，重劃南北二市，各設分廳，甫及半載，仍復舊制。</p>
<p>迨民國十六年，國民革命，軍奠定京滬，是年七月上海建立市政府，於是改組為市公安局。惟秩序初定，警察星散，所餘檢枝，不過五百，當時市區擴大，人口激增，治安警力，亟須加強，遂將遊巡警察四隊，改為保安隊，編第一期敎練所學警為二隊，共有保安六隊，又水巡隊，偵緝隊及軍樂隊各一，外設警區心，分所二千。至十六年度底，始有官警三七九九名，十九年度底，增至五千零三十三名。自二十年十二月接收江蘇省水上公安隊，而本局水巡隊之職權，始告統一。但經一二八事變後，警力設備，均蒙極大損失，事後力圖恢復，二十二年度底，則有官警總數五四三八名，二十三年度底，官警總數增至五五五三名，在此階段中，雖已略具規模，而警察素質之不良，一切配備之欠完善，有待於補充改正之點尚多，此已往之大概情形也。</p>
<p>上海警察之任務，消極方面，在防患於未然，保障全市人民生命財產之安全，積極方面，在完成新都市，增進全市人民生活之福利，欲達此目的，必須整飭紀律，嚴申賞罰。且虛心，堅忍、謙恭、誠實，勤勞，儉樸，謹愼，熱烈，勇敢，不為勢屈，不為利誘，從艱危困頓之中，刻苦磨鍊，以增進其學識，經騐，閱歷，才幹，憑熱血與朝氣，勇往直前，以作全市民衆之模範興表率。進而再組織之，訓練之，使民衆武力化，武力民衆化，民衆警察化，警察民衆化，萬衆一心，同舟共濟，不獨上海一市之安全，有所保障，擴而大之，實奠定民族復興之永久基石也。</p>
<p>余有見於此，故從二十四年就職以來，即努力改革，積極建設，如增設煙民登記科，實行禁煙禁毒，設新運股，積極推行新運，添設女警，以盡特殊偵查效能，置騐槍組，採用科學檢騐，設置警備車隊，為治安上有效之防範，此皆舊制所未有而新創建者也。又如擴充督察處，以發揮督察警備之功用，改組偵緝隊，以盡偵查緝捕之職責，擴充警察總隊，以應時勢之需要，此皆舊制所有而加以改善與充實者也。現在總局內部組織，分為四科一處。第一科專司總務事宜，計分：人事，文書，編纂，統計，會計，庶務、裝械七股。第二科辦理警察行政事務，計分：治安，戶籍，外事，商事，保健，救濟，交通，消防，八股。第三科辦理司法事務，計分：審訊，收解，事務，指紋，四股．煙民登記科，專司禁毒事務，計分：牌照，查緝，稽核，事務，四股。督察處，分司內外勤務，特務稽查，及一切警備事務，計分：內勤，外勤，警事，訓育，新運，特務，警備，調查，八般。至外部組織，盡全市為八區，設分局八，警察所二十二，分駐所三十四，派出所水陸共一百零八。此外並設警察總隊，偵緝隊，水巡隊，警察訓練所，拘留所等，總計內外部職員八百餘人，長警七千餘人，請願警一千餘人。</p>
<p>現在之上海，已為全國商業咽喉，為國都神經之中樞，不獨商買麕集，且成政治重心，中外雜居、人煙稠密漸為文化發展之源泉，民族心靈接觸之總滙。按余理想中之新都市，其形式當日進於整齊，嚴肅，雄偉，進取之壯觀，其精神宜含有親愛，仁厚，誠摯，和平之美質。故近兩年來，除改善組織，擴充警力，加強警察本身力量外，又注意修訂官警服制，改革辦案手續，消弭學潮工潮，剷除貪污土劣，皆其犖犖大者，此外更以訓練官警，調查戶口，禁煙禁毒，及推行新運四項，標為中心工作，此本市警察現在之情形也。</p>
<p>關於今後之設施，亟須改善與促進之事項尚多，如增加警額，提高待遇，添置新式設備，建築適宜局所，均為刻不容緩者，但必須寬籌經費，延攬專才，悉力以赴，然後本市警政，可期望有新時代之進步，深望市府同人，各界賢達，指導贊助，兼程並進，促其成功者也。</p>
<p>上海環境特殊，租界一日存在，則警權一日不能完全行使，且領事裁判權，尚未撤銷，管理市區之外人，尤感掣肘。故事無大小，總須煞費苦心，謹愼處理，襟懷如光風霽月，論理當憂玉敲金，無論條理萬千，悉必脚踏實地，不恃一瞥之感情，無理之衝動，而累，一切困難，自能迎刃而解。希望吾警政人員，特加注意，務使一切警察行政，均能於合理化現代化，以增加外人之信仰，將來於租界問題及取銷不平等條約之進行上，庶有當相之助力也。</p>
<p>一切過去，演成現在，又由現在，變為將來，因果牽連，禍福相依，始構成如此複雜之過程。任何成功，不足為喜，可以看作失敗，任何失敗，不必絕望，竭力促其成功。只要人人能從自覺自強中．準備．自我之實力，從事大規模之團結，以偉大之合力，突破目前之危艱。要知民族復興，不單是軍事準備之充實，更須社會各方面之努力共進。國民對國家之貢獻，亦不僅前方抗敵之將士，更須後方人人有勇猛精進之决心，與堅恒不拔之意志，為之後盾。嚴重之局勢，險惡之遭際，當以大中華民族本來至大至剛至中至正之精神，與艱苦卓絕之奮鬥衝破之！人人要作“富貴不能淫，貧賤不能移，威武不能屈”之大丈夫！人人要積極一好學，力行，知恥”，以進於“智，仁，勇”之境地！無論任何階級，任何職業之民衆，皆為充實國力之重要份子，團結在同一主義，同一目標，同一步驟，同一行動在我最高領袖指揮之下同仇敵愾，作殊死之奮鬥！由全國人民各別努力之中，求得其總成績，此乃眞正整個民族最確實最偉大之力量也。</p>
<p>余以服務警察，三年來所得之經騐，深知警察與民衆之關係，必須警察辦得好，然後民衆有優良之導師與保姆，進而訓練民衆，組織民衆，方能陶鑄一般民衆，成為現代化之國民，然後整個民族，得以戰勝一切艱難，可以言自存，亦可以言共存，風雨如晦，鷄鳴不已，謹當奮其棉薄，兼程以赴，邦人君子，幸共勉之。</p>
<h3>市警察局長蔡勁軍</h3>
<h3>上海市之工務</h3>
<p>— 沈怡</p>
<p>溯自本市政府成立以來，在建設新市區及整理舊市區兩大方針之下，對于各項工作，如道路系統暨全市分區之規劃，及道路溝渠橋梁碼駁頭岸市有房屋之建築，河道海塘之疏浚修建，市民營造之取締監督，靡不循序實施，積極推進，茲撮要分述如次：</p>
<p>（一）道路系統之規畫</p>
<p>建設現代化之都市，道路系統及路線計畫為必要條件，而規畫道路系統尤為建設及整理市區之基本工作，蓋於城市交通及建築物之佈置，所關至鉅也，十年來已先後規定公佈者，有全市幹道系統，全市各區道路系統及各區道路系統內所包括之各路路線。</p>
<p>（二）計劃全市分區</p>
<p>本市為謀市政健全發展起見，經勘酌各種需要，考察實地情形，劃分下列各區城。</p>
<p>㊀行政區市中心區之中央部份。</p>
<p>㊁工業區吳淞江蘊藻浜兩岸，南市國貨路以南，閘北沿柳營河橫浜河一帶浦東自慶寗寺起向南至楊思港沿浜一帶</p>
<p>㊂住宅商業區滬南區域城廂以內，滬西愚園路南，虹橋路北，海格路西，凱旋路東之間。</p>
<p>㊃油池區高橋沙</p>
<p>㊄木業區域北票煤鑛公司南首起，至江山路止沿浦一帶。</p>
<p>（三）道路溝渠之建築及整理。</p>
<p>㊀市中心區聯絡商港碼頭鐵道及各區交通之幹道，已建築完成者，有其美路，黃興路，三民路，五權路，淞滬路，水電路，閘殷路，及中山北路之一部份．次要道路已建築完成者，有第一二兩次招領地及職員招領一範圍內各路。正在建築中者，有第三次招領地範圍內各路，各路之下水道，採用合流制，日後並準備於幹管通入小河之處，建造治理污水廠用沉澱方法，去其污渣，而排洩其剩水於河中。所有第一二兩次招領地及職員招領地內溝管，均已排設完成，現正從事敷設第三次招領地內各溝管。</p>
<p>㊁滬南區該區原有街道，多係強街路面，十年來已將主要各路次第開關整理，如東門路和平路及裹馬路自東門路至大碼頭街一段，均排設溝管，舖築柏油路面。此外新排溝渠有陸家浜路，斜土路，製造局路，打浦路，魯班路等處。</p>
<p>㊂閘北區該區道路，多為彈街路面，經先後將大統路，共和路，恒豐路，及寶山路甫段改築柏油路面，並排設水管，中經“一二八”事變，該區建設，毀壞殆盡，因照規定計劃，將各路路線澈底整理，並將寶山路北段及虬江路，寶興路，賓昌路，鴻奠路，寶源路等改築冷柏油路面，水電路改築澆柏油路面。又江灣吳淞兩處街道，亦因兵燹全部毀損，并經照規定路線統予整理，如吳淞之淞興路，同與路，江灣之萬安路等，均經排設溝管翻築路面。</p>
<p>㊃浦東區闢築浦東大道，並整理春山街等。綜計十年來共築柏油路八四，一七一公尺，小方石路三，九一五公尺，砂石路五，○九八公尺，彈街路二三，一二五公尺，煤屑路二二二，○七一公尺。共排大小溝營一八九，五○八公尺。</p>
<p>（四）橋梁碼頭駁岸之建築</p>
<p>㊀橋梁本市區內河道，最大者為黃浦江，次為吳淞江蘊藻浜，為發展兩岸交通計十年來共建築橋梁二百五十八座，支出工費計九十三萬八千餘元。較大者為跨越吳淞江之恒暨橋，鳥鎮橋，曹家渡橋，中山路三號橋，及跨越蘊藻浜之蘊藻浜橋（該橋工程甫竣，卽毀於“一二八”事變，雖經收拾燼餘，重行修理，但僅能通行六噸左右之車輛。）</p>
<p>㊁碼頭駁岸本市為通商口岸，水陸交通，異常繁複，外洋船舶，均靠黃浦，內河小輪，則大半行駛於吳淞江中，故碼頭駁岸之修建，極為重要。十年來共建碼頭九十四座，造價三十二萬餘元。新建駁岸三千七百七十一公尺，造價共二十七萬九千餘元。</p>
<p>（五）市有建築市有建築約分下列四類</p>
<p>㊀關於行政官署方面者，有市中心區之市政府及各局所辦公房屋。</p>
<p>㊁關於文化敎育事業者，有運動塲，體育館，游泳池，圖書館，博物館，動物園，植物園及各學校新建之校舍等。</p>
<p>㊂關於公共衛生及公衆設傭方面者，有市立醫院，市立滬南醫院，衛生試騐所，滬北區衛生事務所，市立傳染病醫院，市立第一公墓，各處菜塲吳淞公園第一公園，文廟公園等。</p>
<p>㊃關於平民福利事業者，有全家菴路，斜土路，交通路等平民住所三處及中山路，其美路，普善路，太平橋路等平民村四所。共計房屋一千八百四十八間。</p>
<p>十年來新建市有建築，共計造價四百九十九萬九千二百四十八元六角八分。</p>
<p>（六）河道</p>
<p>本市河迫錯綜，大都通潮，極易淤塞，以言水利，無不在亟待開浚之列；徒以限於財力，祇得擇要舉辦。計十年業疏浚河道，總長一○四，○三一公尺，挖出土方二，八○六，八一四立方公尺，共用工程費六十八萬七千七百二十五元一角。主要工程為疏浚吳淞江，蒲滙塘，滬南碼頭區挖泥等。</p>
<p>（七）海塘</p>
<p>本市所轄東西衣周三塘，共約長二十四公里有奇，年久失修，險象環生，市工務局於十八年六月接管塘工、卽經統籌規劃，顧限於經費於二十一年六月及二十三年九月先將最危險之部份，加以修築，共用工程費六十八萬六千餘元。</p>
<p>（八）營造之取締</p>
<p>居住問題，為人生四大需要之一，市工務局職掌全市人民營造之指導監督及取締事，故對於承包工程之營造廠，必令來局登記，按其資本經騐核給甲乙丙等執照，俾市民知所採擇。市區內無論何項建築，均須照章請照，隨時派員詳為查勘，如有未合規章之處，不惜一再取締，務使與核准原圖相符，用策公衆安全。十年來新屋增加極多，質的方面，尤多改進，計自成立起至二十五年六月底止，共發執照一七，八九三件，營造面積計四，二二○，二六○平方公尺，估計造價約為一三六，三一一，六三○元。</p>
<p>又房屋年久失修者，易致傾斜，危險堪虞，尤以公共塲所為甚，市工務局對於幅區內危險房屋，除由業主自動請照拆卸者外，先之以通知，繼之以催拆，再不遵辦，則呈請市政府批准後派工代拆，以保公衆安全。自成立時起至二十五年六月底止，計拆卸舊屋六七○，三三○平方公尺。</p>
<p>（九）結論</p>
<p>本市建設事業，攸關中外觀瞻，勢難因陋就簡。故對於設計方面，均採用現代城市分區制度，以謀市政之健全發展，同時對於新市區之建設與舊市區之整理，統籌並顧，期無偏廢。俾達㛘設大上海之目的。惟是轄境遼闊，財力有限，不得不權衡緩急，循序漸進。時光荏苒，寒暑十更，用誌崖略，以告邦人。</p>

<h3>上海市衛生十年來演進概要</h3>
<p>— 李廷安</p>
<p>上海為世界商埠之一，在十年以前，尚無現代衛生事業之可言，疫病流行，死亡甚衆，而霍亂一病，尤為每年夏秋二季所必不免之禍害。迨民國十五年八月間，始有近代衛生事業之開端，自設立衛生事業專管機關以後，滬南滬北自來水大加改良，免費注射霍亂預防疫苗及佈種牛痘，衛生敎育，衛生試騐，取締不良飲食物品，管理醫藥職業，舉辦學校衛生，提倡產婦嬰兒衛生等事，始有創辦，均為减少疾病增進健康之要圖，日積月累，於防疫保健，洵有其不可磨滅之功效。此外尤覺堪以報述者，厥唯市民對於衛生觀念之進步，而向衛生機關商請指導援助事件之逐年增多，及執行衛生法令之順利進行，可為明證者也。</p>
<p>上海市衛生局掌理全市衛生行政，為上海市政府直轄行政機關之一，係于民國十六年七月七日．將前淞滬衛生局接收改組，主其事者，自民國十六年七月七日至二十一年十月五日，為前局長胡鴻基博士，因胡博士覆車殞命，乃由上海市政府呈請國民政府任命廷安繼任，于二十一年十月二十四日到任，服務迄今，現在局內共設三科，第一科分設文書，會計，庶務，醫藥管理，衛生敎育，生命統計等六股，第二科分設清道清潔，普通衛生，肉品檢騐等三股，第三科分設產婦嬰兒衛生，學校衛生，勞工衛生，防疫，診療等五股，衛生局在市中心區域，市立醫院及衛生試騐所亦設於此，擬於本市各區各設衛生事務所，推行預防醫學之各種工作，又於各區設置醫院或診療所，而與市立醫院取得聯絡，推行治療醫學之各種工作，尚有傳染病醫院，戒烟醫院等之組織，以應特種疾病之需求。</p>
<p>上海市衛生事業之建設，雖因經費所限，猶待繼續完成者尚多，但十年以來頗有逐年進展之事實，尤於一二八以後更不惜於經費奇絀之中力圖建設，例如原有吳淞衛生模範區辦事處被燬，閘北診療所被燬，現已成立吳淞區衛生事務所及滬北區衛生事務所，江灣區亦於兵燹灰燼之後設立該區衛生事務所，又如常設之治療床位在一二八以前尚付闕如，自一二八以後，設置吳淞區醫院，江灣區醫院，傳染病醫院，戒毒所，戒烟醫院，市醫院，滬南醫院等治療處所，已有常設床位一千一百餘張，而護士學校，滬南區衛生事務所，新建衛生試騐所，市立公墓等，亦均於一二八之役以後所開辦按上海市之地位為中外屬目之區，其衛生事業，亦為中外市政學，衛生學，醫學等專家所注意，蒞滬參觀之公共衛生專家多人，曾作直率批評，許以所訂施政方針，及工作之努力，無可非議，故疫病之害銳减，市民衛生觀念亦漸普遍，唯各種建設與工作，尚在開始之階段上，仍待加以擴充，方可達到完備目的，其十年以來所以有此進步之收獲者，其內在原因，一則由於歷任市長重視衛生與市政之關係，督促甚力，而市政府所屬各機關間，復能聯絡推進，一則由於任用之工作人員，選擇較嚴，且使久於其任，方可恃之以恒，而獲相當之進步。用述概要以冀閱者之指敎而為今後之南針焉。</p>

<h3>上海市之公用事業</h3>
<p>— 徐佩璜</p>
<p>上海市之有公用事業，尚在四十年以前，最先創設者，有內地自來水公司，其後華商電氣公司，閘北水電公司，寶明浦東眞如翔華等電氣公司，及滬太上南滬閔上川諸長途汽車公司，先後成立，於是本市自來水，電氣，電車，長途汽車，各種供給漸備，公用事業亦粗具規模。第當時各種事業之缺點，厥為僅注意於量的發展，而極少質的改進，即如內地閘北兩水廠，在民國十六年時，每日出水總數僅達七六，八○○立方公尺，不足以應需要，而水質又極污濁，有礙術生，再如電氣方面，當時市內電廠共有六家之多，而發電量不敷供給，以致電廠旣需購用外商電流，以為補充，市區以內，如滬北滬西等處，為外商電廠越界供電之處頗多，主權利益，兩受損害。至於電話交通等事業，則當時交通部電話局能力過於薄弱，機件亦多陳舊，通話不甚便利，故市區以內為外商電話公司越界經營之處，亦復不少。至滬南閘北兩處交通器具之不足，市民往來，旣感不便，而市區發展，尤受影響。</p>
<p>自市府成立，設立公用局，以專司公用事業，十年以來，從整理發展兩方，分別進行。今幸官廳與商民共同努力，得使本市公用事業，頓改舊觀，經營自來水事業之內地閘北兩公司，均經本局督促添置設備，於是每日出水量，內地公司增加至九七，○○○立方公尺，閘北公司六八，二○○立方公尺，以之供給各該么司營業區域之用水量，頗為充足，水質方面，亦經改良，頗為純凈。目前該兩公司，正在舉辦添建水廠等設備工程，將來可增加出水量閘北公司為三五，八○○立方公尺，內地公司為六八，○○○立方公尺，則水量當可益為充足。浦東地方之自來水亦經本局歷年籌劃，產由市興業信託社建設水廠，已於本年六月十九日正式出水，每日出水量為一四，五○○立方公尺。吳淞區之自來水，則經本局於二十四年二月，與閘北水電公司訂約，由該公司承辦。徐家滙及滬南輪船碼頭輸船用水，亦經本局給水處饋水轉供。至外商水公司在市內越界給水之處，除滬西越界築路區域，正由本局依照中央所定原則交涉收回外，其在閘北徐家滙一帶者，業經交涉收回？改由閘北內地兩公司，分別供給，現在管線所及漸能普及，故市民取用，漸臻便利。</p>
<p>本市電氣事業之整理，經本局於十六年間决定統一電廠計劃，十年以來，次第進行，業己完成閘北公司之發電總容量增為二二，五○○瓩，華商公司為一六，○○○瓩，浦東公司為六○○瓩，以之併給市內五個電氣公司用戶之用，尚嫌不足，故復經本局督促閘北華商兩公司，擴充設備，茲已由閘北公司添置一二，五○○瓩發電機兩具，其一已經完工，另一正在進行，華商公司添置一五○○○瓩汽輸發電機兩部，尚在建設中。同時浦東公司，亦在建設一○，○○○瓩之發電廠一所，一切工程，正在進行，一俟各該公司設備擴充完成後，則全市用電，當可自給自足矣。至滬西越界築路區域，本為上海電力公司越界供給，亦經本局與該公司交涉，另組中外合資之滬西電力公司，受本市監督。本市電話事業，除租界方面由上海電話公司經營外。其餘各虞，均為交通部上海電話局經營。五年前市區內電話頗不滿市民之望，近來該局擴充設備，並將人工接線機改為自動電話機，俾市民接用便利，通話靈敏。至電話公司在市區各處越界裝置之電話，亦經本局會同上海電話局與該公司交涉，經簽訂電話臨時合約，規定權利義務，以保主權。</p>
<p>至於交通事業，滬南閘北浦東等處公衆乘物，向感缺乏，現在滬南方面，除由本局督促華商電氣公司將第二第三兩路電車改為圓路外，並由本局舉辦市營公共汽車，其路線且由滬南而及於漕河涇，及浦東一帶•閘北方面，亦於民國十七年起行駛公共汽車，現在由華商公共汽車公司路線所經之處，西至眞如，東至市中心區虬江碼頭一帶。至於黃浦江水面交通，自本局創辦市輸渡之後，往來漸稱便利。</p>
<p>我人言本市公用事業，回溯旣往，約如上述。際茲本市成立上週年紀念之辰，瞻望將來，願再就所憶，以伸期望。上海為工商大埠，市民三百八十餘萬，年來受世界經濟恐慌之影響，工商各業，久為不景氣所籠罩，頗呈凋敝之狀。茲者經濟潮流已有昭蘇之象，則本市工商業之勃與，將為事所必然，影響所及，水電交通之需要，亦必隨之增多，故應有良好之公用事業供給，尤為當務之急。</p>
<p>本市現有自來水公司三處，其地點分佈，頗為適當。茲則內地閘北兩水廠，均在擴充設備，預計工竣之後，內地公司可增加出水量至一六五，○○○立方公尺，閘北公司可增加至一○四，○○○立方公尺。若以目前平均每人每日用次量內地公司一，一五公升計算，閘北公司八五公升計算，則內地公司當可供給人口一百五十萬，閘北公司亦可供給一百二十萬人。若以近十年該兩公司營業區域內人口增加率推算，則該兩公司現有出水量，均可維持供給至十年以上，最近期間，可無需於擴充。浦東水廠，每日出水量可達一四，五○○立方公尺，該處地廣人稀，目前所需水量尚少，將來建設漸多，則該廠自不難發揮其能力。至眞如方面之給水，亦經本局計劃，冀於最近期間，得有自來水供給，俾該處居民飲用方便。</p>
<p>電氣事業，目前情形，閘北華商浦東三大電廠，方積極擴充設備，預計工商繁榮之後，電氣需要將大量增加，自當由三大電廠繼續擴充，並須於技術業務各方注意改進，使每度電之成本减輕，以減低售電價格，俾市民均得以最低代價，得最多之享用。市區之內，供給普遍，並由本市饋電鄰近各縣，同享集中發電之利益，電話事業當務之急，在於繼續擴充線路，與普遍裝置自動電話機，俾能裝用便利，通話靈便。前者為限制電話公司在市區內擴充電話用戶起見，訂有臨時合約，然為根本之圖，自當訂立永久合約，則特區與市區直接通話，以及取銷通話費等問題，均可及時討論，此雖為交通部電話局之職責，本局為市民謀福利，自當盡力協助，以促其成。</p>
<p>交通事業，前經本局確定五年計劃，將按步就班，分期推行，以圖改進。目前最大之缺點，則為本市南北交通之缺少聯絡，聯絡方法，自以行駛高速度之地道車，或高架車為適用，惟地車道建築，旣不宜於本市地質，且工程浩大，需費繁多，亦非本市目前財力所能勝任。至於高架車，則工程與經費，尚須得租界當局之同意。就現在情形，地面交通之聯絡，亦有迫切需要，惟閘北方面，公共交通器具，尚感缺乏，故閘北公共文通之如何推行便利，以及南北交通之如何聯絡，本局正就此兩問題，統籌解决之方，務期市民往來便利，則時間經濟，兩有裨益。以上所述。瞻望將來，厥為我人之職責，自當縣為鵠的，匪勉以赴，以求實現。至推行之能否順利，尚望全市市民予以督促，賜以贊助，俾上海之公用事業，日益發達，則幸甚焉</p>

<h3>上海市之地政</h3>
<p>— 徐桴</p>
<p>本市已接收區域之面積五三○，七四方公里，土地七八六，八九一畝，屬舊上海縣部分者五二九，一○七畝，屬舊實山縣部分者二五七，七八四畝，舊上海縣部分已經測丈之戶地四三八，一七八畝，未經澌丈者九○、九二九畝，經測丈後由人民繳銷舊單發給土地證者一七一，九○六戶，自本年四月一日開始登記後，已經聲請登記者六，五四○戶。</p>
<p>自市政府成立，專設土地局以處理土地事務，對於測丈，方有精密之設計，對於地籍，始從事澈底之整理。然以舊魚鱗圖早經散失，所存糧冊，收除紊亂，產權之訟，幾無虛日，以本市地價之高昂，設有分釐之差額，即有千萬元之出入，人民為利益而爭，冊籍無明確記載，因此難於解决，致遷延時日，整理工作，旣感困難，地政進行，邃以遲滯</p>
<p>本市區域，劃自上實兩縣．舊上海縣部分，自咸豐五年清丈之後，未經重丈，是以糾紛特多。現在測丈工作，積極進行，預計於明年三月底全部告成，但測丈之後，須由人民自行看圖認界，簽字繳局，無四鄰反對，方為確定。乃人民對於登記，尚多膜視，舊單旣未繳局，地圖無從認看，測丈雖已竣事，界址猶未確定，登記延不聲請，新狀無從發給，苟非嚴加督促，一氣呵成，則曠日持久，地形改變，又將全功盡棄。是以對於已丈各區，商由市政委員派員實習，以備於分區登記時協助進行，如試辦有效，則舊上海縣屬部分之登記，不難於數年之內，告厥成功。</p>
<p>舊屬寶山縣部分，於宣統三年清丈完竣，圖冊俱全，但以築路之後，路基多未劃除，閒有地形變更者，亦宋複丈，如據以登記，容易錯誤，是以在該區域內，暫行緩辦，一俟舊屬上海縣部分清丈完竣，再定進行計劃。人民如必須請求登記，得於清丈後行之。</p>
<p>土地所有權之登記，依據已經測丈之地籍，土地政策之實施，依據已經登記之現狀，除整理土地之外，並須顧到土地使用問題，房屋救濟問題，地價及定著物之估計，稅率之訂定。是以登記完竣之後，應分類統計，視其結果而確定整個計劃，不但使耕者有其地，並須使居者有其屋。酌盈劑虛，俾負擔歸於平均，生活趨於安定，方足以言地政。</p>
<p>本局自改組地政局以來，雖僅逾百日，而無日不在照上述計劃依據土地法推動進行之中，如登記之實施，地籟冊之編造，地價稅之推行，估定標準地價之設計，均為最近之重要工作。將來地價稅推及鄉區之後，地價低廉之地，當較田賦為輕。雖影響歲收，苟能實施地政，有利市民，自當期其實現。</p>
<p>今日為市政府成立十週紀念日，亦卽為本局成立之十週紀念日，已往之十周中，經歷任市長與局長之經營璧劃，得有今日之成續。再歷幾年，凡目前一切繁雜之問題，艱巨之工作，將全部遞變為整齊之圖冊，盡一簿籟，任何問題，一經檢閱，莫不瞭如指掌。凡市內之工廠，市塲，住宅，學校，農村，均將分區設置，而間以足供市民游息之園林，運動塲，娛樂塲，一切稅率，公平確當，為市民所確能負擔，而樂於輸將，方為本市地政之成功，亦卽為大上海計劃之成功。桴以兼攝地政，敬進一言，為市府祝。為市民告，為同人勗。</p>
<h3>上海市之保安</h3>
<p>— 吉章簡</p>
<p>滬凟為國防最前綫之一環，綰穀南北，屏蔽幾輔，商旅輻輳，貨品雲集，旣商業之要府，亦神洲之洪都，自一二八之役以後，地方精華，慘遭摧殿，閘北，江灣，吳淞等區，廬墓為墟，迨五五停戰協定成立，閩贛匪氛，勢益燎原，我駐滬國軍，啣命調贛以至滬凟防務，頓形空虛彼時擔任維持治安之責者，乃臨時組織之警察隊，後以地方遼闊，伏莽潛滋，市府為鞏固防務起見，乃援蘇鄂贛浙諸省先例，呈請政府設立保安處，專負此方治安責任，嗣奉行政院及軍委會核准，上海市保安處遂於二十一年八月一日成立，此為上海保安系統成立之始也。</p>
<p>保安處成立之初也，下轄第一第二兩團，第一團原為北平警察大隊，奉命調滬，歸市府節制，協助維持本市治安，其始編制，頗與軍隊不同，迨保安處成立，改隸保安處，經改編整頓，乃有今日，第二團原屬憲兵第六團，奉命調滬擔任防務，旋亦改隸保安處，該團組織尚稱健全，改隸時祇變更隊號而已。</p>
<p>初保安處長一職，由上海市市長吳鐵城兼攝，鱖後吳市長以市府政務繁忙，無暇兼顧，乃於是年十月一日辭去兼職，遺缺由楊處長虎繼任，楊處長在職三年有半，對於滬市保安，多所擘劃，迨楊處長榮升淞滬警備司令，市府乃於二十五年四月，奉准將保安處改組為保安總團，總團長一職，委章簡充任，回溯保安總團自奉命改組以還，規模矩義，略仍數年之舊，惟以市府以年來經費支絀，前市長吳公鐵城，復諄諄以撙節經費相篤勉，章簡視事伊始，即恪遵集訓，凡所設施，務以减少支出為原則，計總團部准尉以上官佐僅二十餘員耳。</p>
<p>本團部成立以來，因士兵逃亡長假及老弱者不少，乃於二十五年九月一日，呈請招兵補充而編制則一仍舊章，此本總團改編後之大概也。</p>
<p>又以本部隊訓練之不容或緩也，乃依照本部團隊實際狀况，擬定大綱，實行分期訓練，訓練範圍，分為雜兵訓練，軍士訓練，重兵器隊訓練，軍官訓練，為確悉所有部隊進度起見，隨時定期舉行檢閱，務期官兵有勇知方，克負保境安民責任。</p>
<p>維持地方之治安，為保安團之唯一責任，惟滬市華洋雜處，良莠不齊，益以租界所在，行政上至多窒碍，莠民匿居租界，狡焉思逞，開導處理。每多棘手，二十五年九月二十三日日水兵案發生，時局緊張，謠諑四起，滬北市民，驚惶萬狀，富者紛紛遷避租界，貧者一夕數驚，其時治安，全賴保安隊與警察維持，分途曉諭市民，勿輕信謠言，致事件擴大，及今局勢雖告緩和，但仍如前警戒，未遑稍懈，故自本團成立以來，始終未發生任何意外事件，任務所至，衆議翕然，滬市向例，每屆歲杪，必籌備冬防，按照淞滬警備司令部所頒發之冬防命令，及冬防計劃，施行警戒，數年以來，靡有間斷，此外如滬市各飛行塲之警衛，工潮學潮之彈壓，及鐵路車站之特別警戒，均由本團部隊協同警察担任，若夫駐防地域，部隊分散滬南滬北各地，駐紮地點，碁佈星羅，北起獅子林砲台，南迄龍華，防區之廣，約五十公里，因地設防，期其周密，而於人煙週密之閘北警備，尤加意焉，以上所述，卽五年來滬市保安及行政之實况，七月七日為上海市政府成立十週年紀念日，發行特刋，徵文於章簡，章簡不文，爰據述經過，以誌沿革云爾。</p>

<h3>上海的亭子樓</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>亭子樓，可以說得是上海的特有建築物。雖然也有人說，有些兒名不符實，因為亭子其名，而不翼然其實。不過亭子樓在上海也已有着近二十年的歷史了而且以現勢而論，上海存在着一日，亭子樓，也總是跟着不會消滅的因為亭子樓的愛好者在上海，實在的不在少數。</p>
<p>雖然亭子樓的地位，在灶間之上，在晒台之下，而且總是向北開窗，冬寒夏熱，是其特點、然而亭子樓，也未始沒有長處的。其最大的優點，便是靜寂。若是把門閉闔了起來，便不啻和同一石庫門中的其他若干鄰居，完全隔絕着了。所以從前曾有人說，“上海的金屋藏嬌者，怡的以亭子樓為金屋的，至少當佔着半數”。這話，雖然是說得有些兒過大，然而藏嬌於亭子樓中，據說，確有春光不外洩之妙。</p>
<p>莫瞧着普通僅只一百方英尺左右的亭子樓，渺乎其小，在上海的亭子樓中，正也到處的住居着完滿的小家庭。普通一個亭子樓的租金，總在四五元至七八元之譜，恰够着月入不豐者的口胃。所以在亭子樓中，儘多着初組小家庭，而方度其蜜月的新夫婦。</p>
<p>窮途潦倒的文學家們，也頗多以亭子樓為寫作之所，因為在半夜中，周遭顯着是無限的靜寂，旣沒有耗子嚙物聲，又沒有隔壁的打鼾聲，小兒的夜啼聲，在這時候，正是嘔心瀝血，振筆疾書，以備明天換取生活費的好時候。</p>
<p>但是這些年來，在上海的亭子樓中，有租着製造毒品，有租着窩藏綁票，或租着幹其他犯法的勾當的了，於是亭子樓的神秘性，是日益偉大了。</p>
<h3>秧田裏</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>鄉下人都把秧插好了，那麼整齊地，一排一排，一顆一顆，站在水裏，秧針翠綠可愛，跑出村子外，一望無涯，中間雖夾雜着幾塊棉花和豆田，也因為同是翠綠色的緣故，頗覺調和。夏天原屬濃綠遍野的季節，陌頭柳蔭，灘邊蘆柴，陪襯子一個綠色原野。</p>
<p>到農村去遠足的人，或者又要感到另是一番“鄉村風光”了。坐在自備或公共長途汽車上，“司必靈”的皮墊柔軟舒適，憑窗眺覽公路旁的泊泊秧田，微風吹着纖細無力的秧針，太陽曬在水面泛出銀色如鏡面的光輝，靑蛙躱在秧顆底下唱着仲夏之歌。只覺倍增了視聽之美感，然而，這種美感却正建樹在農夫們的辛勞上。</p>
<p>秧田的景色果然宜人，但插秧時的一番苦况只有農夫們自知，赤膊灣腰，背皮朝天，被炎陽烤炙着，變成深橙色，和都市裏的烤猪差不多，他們或伏在水車上車栽秧水，或在田裏插秧，水受日光的逼射，發出水蒸氣，薰着面孔，和汗水混成一片。多够難受。</p>
<p>更難受的，要算秧田裏的螞蝗了，它有着尖的腦袋，最善於攢營，混在泥槳裏一伸一縮，神態怪醜怪怕，農夫們精赤着腿足，踏在水田裏，污泥沒脛，螞蝗得了攢營的對象，利用尖頭直向皮肉裏攢進，因為初起僅覺麻痒，不去注意，等感痛後，已有大半條攢入，拉不出，硬拉，就拉斷在內。螞蝗在肌肉中吮血為生，可憐的農夫們還耍受這種小蟲的剝削。</p>
<p>土法是有的，據說只須用油塗抹，一半攢進時，用手拍着肌肉亦會退出。我曾親見一個農夫的腿上被叮了四五條螞蝗，拉得鮮血淋漓。所以到裁秧季節，都怕赤脚下田，穿得起“水鞋”的，在少數。可是為了生活，也沒辦法。都市女子到夏天以露腿赤脚為時髦，因為不要下秧田受螞蝗叮，比較起來，其苦樂自然有天壤之別了。</p>

<h3>再與榕兒書（下）</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>爾兄錚，自五月一日起，奉命赴鎮江受軍事訓練，家中益感岑寂，如有兒在，當不至是。兩月以還，來書凡二十餘通，備述其生活狀况，謂無論操作如何辛勞，必欣然赴之，不敢自逸，并時時以為國宣力自勉。每函輒三四頁，如戀人繕情書，刺刺不已，顧未嘗有一語及兒；余竊疑其薄於手足之愛，殊不謂然。迺讀其致爾玲姊一書，則痛悼之情，溢於辭表，始知其致余書中，所以語不及兒者，蓋恐重撩余之悲緒耳。此兩閱月中，余嘗兩度赴鎮探視，見爾兄健碩如恒，於心良慰；據兩兄言，彼邇來時時夢兒，歡若平生，然則兒殆亦以念兄者切，時往省視耶？余所難以為懷者，即念及一年以前，兒亦嘗來鎮參加全國童軍大露營，勇邁活躍之熊可見，而今則長眠靈巖之下，作陳死人矣。撫今思昔，能毋腸斷！</p>
<p>五月中旬，邑中全體童軍，循例作一年一度之露營；猶憶去歲露營之翌日，余偕爾母及爾弟妹輩來公共體育塲，視兒作何狀。時兒方於飯後伏營幕中，揭幕作鴨視，莞爾而笑，此情依稀如昨。此次余見童軍列隊入塲時，陡憶前事，淚溢於眶，𠄸低首繞道而行。嗟夫嗟夫，吾心匪石，又奚忍重過體育塲耶？</p>
<p>平昔爾母對爾兄弟姊妹七人，待遇悉出平等，未嘗有所厚薄，每有零食，輒均分乏，以食爾曹，如陳平之分肉，務得其平。日者余自滬上携餅餌歸，爾母欣然，仍作七份均分之，俄憶兒已云亡，不能復享此食，遂為之潛然淚下。廢歷重五，爾母循俗作角黍，又憶及兒夙嗜此物，今茲弗能復進，不期心痛手戰，䇹中米簌簌下，幾於中輟。嗟夫榕兒，凡此瑣瑣，吾之所以不憚辭費必欲舉以告兒者，迺欲兒自省一時輕率，災貽爾父母以無涯之痛，將何以對爾父母，兒而有知，其亦後悔否耶？</p>
<p>爾叔股務隴海鐵路，平昔以事集，十餘年未克歸省，茲聞兒死，遂於月初忽忽歸來，與余悽然執手，不能作一語。十餘年前，叔一度來滬，兒方牙牙學語，今乃不及覩兒長成之狀，但索兒遺影痴視而巳。爾叔復言，三月初旬，距兒之死可一星期，兒嘗馳書咸陽問候，此為十餘年來第一書，亦為兒最後之絕筆，而又絕未為余道及其事。兒殆自知末日將至，欲於爾叔處留一紀念耶？</p>
<p>余自將前書刊布後，四方文友，慰問之函紛至，僉謂勿復多專悼念，使兒於重泉之下，轉滋不安。新聞報余空我先生，亦為文張之報端，以少啼鵑血為勸。復有吾申報三十年之老友麥貢三先生者，自漢皋遠道貽書，洋洋千餘言，暢論佛法，反復譬解，以殺吾悲。畏友王一之先生，方客荷蘭，亦自萬里外以郵筒相慰，并惠余彼邦詩人愛敦氏“寶兒初醒記”一帙，蓋為悼其愛子而作，其立論謂吾人形骸之死，實係精神之醒，然則兒今日之一瞑不視，殆亦兒精神初醒時耶？舉以告爾母，為之大慰。</p>
<p>嗟夫榕兒！余痛兒之死，已浪費筆墨數千言，本可即此而止；顧以上諸事，不可不使兒知之。此書之作，即在六月下旬第二度赴鎮探視爾兄時，余因爾兄連想及兒，哀感不能自巳。客邸孤燈，夜深不寐，遂出寸鉛作書，族以神思疲憊而罷。翌日復於車中足成之，筆端如抽藕絲，續續弗斷，不意又逾二千言。而今而後，余將期兒於夢中，不復作書寄兒矣。餘不贅，此間近好，父字。（作於榕見死後之第一百日）</p>
<p>時菓專欄</p>
<h3>馬山楊梅</h3>
<p>— 偶思</p>
<p>武進縣屬馬蹟山，（或稱馬山）山高嶺峻，四面環湖，風景極佳，近復由縣府闢為風景區。馬山楊梅：說出來不會感到生疏的，他不但價錢便宜，而且滋味異樣優美，初嘗它的人，眞有“打耳光還不肯放”之感、現在又是滿樹紅妝的時候了。</p>
<p>近年來，楊梅樹死的很多，因為大家眼見沒有多大收穫，漸漸不去注意它，日有消滅的樣子，尤其白的俗名“水晶梅”的，更是難得了。同時在運輸上，也有許多困難；所以梢為遠些的地方，就無法嘗着它，就有，也不怎麼新鮮可口了。</p>
<h3>李山醉李</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>京杭國道中的長興縣屬李家巷，山水淸幽，風景宜人，深山幽谷中有一塊平原，一半是天然的地勢，一半是由人工的技巧築成的。屋宇櫛比，商賈輻輳，有數萬工人聚集而居，原來是石灰，石子，石粉的產地。有兩家石礦公司，組織得規模很大。</p>
<p>李家巷有座李山，出產了很著名的醉李，醉李的大小，比鷄子大些，顏色和紅玫瑰一樣，李皮很薄，撕下一些皮，就可放在嘴唇邊，把蜜甜的菓汁吸完，並且有一種鮮味。可惜所產不多，李家巷中的人，特向產主預定了，贈給滬杭的股東老闆或親友，一元法幣，只能買到八隻，滬杭的股東老闆因嘗到了異味，每年都託公司中人預定，所以它們是有優先權的。</p>
<p>京中某要人聞得這地所產的醉李大名，便輾轉託人，纔嘗到了異味，便賜了一個“號珀珠”的雅名。但是取名醉李，不知是何用意？想必它的色澤殷紅，如人酒醉時的醉臉一般吧？</p>
<h3>臨塘桃</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>多年不吃臨塘桃了，現在將有重嘗舊味的可能，不該慶幸着口福不薄嗎？</p>
<p>臨塘是安徽休寗縣管轄的一個小農村，住民多善於種植，尤擅長桃。“臨塘桃”究竟著名在那裏？原來有下列幾種優點：一•甜而脆，二•絕無虫，三•皮薄核小，四•外毛不多。總之，臨塘桃的良處，眞非我這枝禿筆形容得盡的。</p>
<p>桃樹，我們村上亦植得不少，但結成的桃却沒有臨塘桃來得鮮美，簡直一入口就有一股酸酸的味兒。為了這我曾經去詢問住在臨塘的表叔。據他說當桃樹長了約一人身高左右而未開花的時候，即用別種枝幹（如李•枇杷•均可）用泥包接在桃樹枝間，這樣結成的果就會甜而鮮美了。</p>
<p>上海是很難找到“臨塘桃”的踪跡的，因為相隔太遠，加為交通又不便，不能像白沙枇杷般供給上海人大快朶願，不過物質文明的浪花已經飛進我們的鄉村了，京贛鐵路不是快要完成了嗎？處女般的臨塘桃定有被上海少爺欣賞的可能，果能如此，對於臨塘的住民不無小補吧？</p>

<p>友梅道：我知道你心境不好。不過，他，他，他也不該。友梅說着話時，正斟了一杯茶，送到夢蘭面前來，是很不在意的樣子說出來的。夢蘭突然的站了起來，兩手按了茶杯，向友梅檢上望着，問道：他有什麼不當做的事嗎？友梅道：在一本雜誌上，我看到他的一篇小說。上寫着一個男子參與了他一個知己的結婚典禮。當時，他心裏尖刀眞在剜着。然而他在酒席筵前，唱歌，豁拳，行令，表面上高興極了。於是回家之後，借酒一塲大睡，直睡到三天才醒。故事是很簡單，可是他描寫那個男子，心裏悲痛，而又對人歡喜的時候，那種矛盾的意境，寫得實在好，我這種事外之人，也不免掉了兩三點淚。夢蘭聽他說的時候，臉色變着，兩隻眼珠呆定着，似乎也有眼淚要掉出來。等他說完，他立刻格格的笑起來，笑得好像是很厲害，把前仰後合的，把頭髮也蓬亂了，於是掬出手絹來擦擦臉，順帶着揉了兩下眼睛，笑道：你說話也不禁駁。你這樣一個胸襟開闊的人，會聽評書吊淚，替古人躭憂。而且你自己也數過了眼淚水只有兩三點，友梅已是亮上電燈的了。彼此在電燈下，相距得不遠，他眼睛已是紅了，怎樣不知道？他這樣一陣狂笑，來得太無謂而且突然！為什麼這樣，心裏已經明白了。因笑道：我怕你吃了飯不容易消化，特意引着你發笑的這不好嗎？夢蘭道：好，多謝老朋友的盛意，我吃也吃了，笑也笑了，我該走了。說着撣了友梅的手道：我們所要說的話很多，但是我一句也沒有說到。你是我的多年同學，我的性情你知道，用不着我說了。我知道我負人，但是我沒有法子，月亮瘦了，有再圓的日子，人病了，老了，可不能再去找那失掉的靑春。我要走了，我不能不說，恕我辭不達意。他這一番話，友梅知道他不是對自己說的，就連連的點了幾下頭，低聲道：我明白，有機會，我會代你說。夢蘭道，什麼？你也要等機會嗎？友梅也有友梅的苦衷，如何好好對他說，只是握住他的手，連連搖撼幾下而已。（一九三）</p>

(Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Original Text of He Yingqin's Opening Address</p>
<p>[Chongqing] The original text of Minister He's opening address at the Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Committee meeting at 11:00 AM on the 6th is as follows: Comrades, today is the inauguration of the Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Committee. Military reorganization is the responsibility of the Ministry of Military Affairs. Therefore, upon receiving orders from the National Government and Chairman Chiang, I, despite being very busy, came to Chongqing with Director Gu to participate. Director Liu, although newly recovered from a long illness, also came with the committee members as scheduled. Therefore, we have the opportunity to meet and discuss the methods and steps for implementing military reorganization in Sichuan and Kang, striving to fully implement the established plan. I feel very pleased about this and should first express my gratitude to Director Liu and all comrades. Speaking of military reorganization, this is an important task after the completion of national unification. It can also be said that only by thoroughly completing military reorganization can true national unification be achieved. Let's take a look at the major continental military powers in the world. For example, the Soviet Union has only about 690,000 regular and militia backbone troops, organized into 35 regular infantry divisions and 15 cavalry divisions. France has 455,000 troops, organized into 25 infantry divisions, 5 cavalry divisions, and 2 brigades. Germany has 450,000 troops, organized into 36 divisions. Italy has about 300,000 troops, organized into 31 infantry divisions, 2 light divisions, and 3 Alpine brigades. Japan has about 250,000 troops, organized into 17 divisions (totaling 70 infantry regiments). The standing army of each country is at most only several hundred thousand. Once there is a foreign war, these several hundred thousand troops serve as the backbone, and reservists and veterans are called up to form the necessary force. Their combat effectiveness can be maintained for several years to fight the enemy to the final victory. This is why each country implements a conscription system, with reservists and veterans who can be called up for replenishment. Unlike our country, which maintains a standing army of more than two million troops in peacetime, but due to loose organization and lack of unified command, once the country faces foreign aggression, these two million troops may not be fully utilized at the front. Even if two-thirds can be used, once there are casualties, illnesses, and attrition, there are no reserves to replenish them. At the same time, because of the large quantity but poor quality, the strength of our one division is not as strong as that of one brigade from the major powers. For example, in the Battle of Shanghai and the Great Wall Campaign, the enemy's strength was almost equal to ours, but we still could not win. This is entirely due to the large quantity but poor quality. The country spends a lot of military expenses to support these two million troops in peacetime, but they cannot fully fulfill the responsibility of protecting the country and its people. This is a very dangerous thing and a great shame for our military. In order to complete the necessary military preparations for national defense and ensure that the fighting force can be replenished continuously, we must implement a conscription system. To enhance the combat effectiveness of our army, we must first reorganize the military, so that the organization, personnel, management, education, training, and command system of the army are completely unified under the central government. Moreover, our military budget amounts to tens of millions of yuan each year, but this amount is only enough to maintain the basic living of officers and soldiers, and there is no mention of enriching weapons and equipment, let alone supplementing new weapons and equipment. We must make the national army uniform and modernized, capable of undertaking the task of national defense and responding to modern warfare. In particular, we must reorganize the military, save unnecessary expenses, and use the savings to enrich new weapons and increase special forces. Therefore, since 1936, the Ministry of Military Affairs has been following the military reorganization principles approved by Chairman Chiang and has begun to carry out the work of military reorganization, starting with the centrally controlled troops. In a year and a half, dozens of divisions have been reorganized, and it is planned to gradually nationalize and modernize all national troops. The reorganized troops will be listed as the backbone of the national defense forces and bear the important responsibility of national defense. Since the implementation, everything has been very smooth and effective. In mid-February of this year, the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee was held, and a report on the national military reorganization principles approved by Chairman Chiang was submitted. These principles include five points: First, unify the organization. There are currently six types of organizations. Considering the needs of modern warfare, the possibilities of equipment, and the ease of adjustment and implementation, unify them into two types: A and B. (Omitted) Second, reduce large units and enrich small units. (Omitted) Third, increase the combat effectiveness of the troops. (Omitted) Fourth, do not increase recurring expenses. Within the existing budget of each division, reorganize and appropriately reduce the organization, reorganize and improve the treatment of officers and soldiers, and issue national disaster allowances to ensure that the organization and expenses are suitable, without increasing additional expenses, and achieve the purpose of reorganization. Fifth, personnel and management are handled entirely in accordance with laws and regulations. For example, the appointment, tenure, transfer, punishment, and retirement of officers in each unit must be in accordance with the provisions of personnel laws and regulations. In particular, the appointment, removal, and transfer of officers must be submitted to the central government for approval and must not be appointed independently or reported after the fact. In addition, those who have appointed managers in each division must gradually change to actual expense management, implement roll call issuance of salaries, implement annual and temporary accounting inspections, compile budgets, and eliminate the past malpractices of contracting and embezzlement. These principles have been approved by the central government, and the reorganization of the national army will be carried out in accordance with these principles. Sichuan and Kang are the base for national defense, and the resources of the people of Sichuan and Kang are excellent and rich in national and ethnic concepts. In recent years, the military personnel of Sichuan and Kang have made many contributions and great efforts to the work of the National Revolution. However, due to historical reasons, many units have expanded their large units day by day, increasing a large number of unarmed soldiers, and have not been able to enrich their weapons and equipment. It can be said that many of them are not used by the major powers before the war. In terms of the number of troops in Sichuan and Kang, the number reported to the central government is eight armies, 26 divisions, and nine independent brigades, totaling 171 infantry regiments. Comparing based on regiments, it is more than two and a half times the number of troops in the entire Japanese army. It is no wonder that it is difficult to enrich the quality with Sichuan Province supporting such a large army. Therefore, the military of Sichuan and Kang must be reorganized, which is a unanimous request of the generals of Sichuan and Kang. Its motivation began around March 20 of this year, when Chairman Liu sent Secretary-General Deng and Director Lu to Beijing on behalf of him. At that time, Acting Director He of the General Headquarters was also in Nanjing. After everyone met, they talked about the issue of national unification, the issue of enriching national defense forces, and the issue of nationalizing the local troops throughout the country. Therefore, they felt that the military of Sichuan and Kang urgently needed to be reorganized in advance. At that time, I had already drafted a few opinions and asked Secretary-General Deng to convey them to Chairman Liu for reference. The most important point in these opinions was that Sichuan is the only base for national defense, and it is hoped that the central government and local areas will unite sincerely to build the foundation for national restoration and ethnicity. It is best to achieve the nationalization of the military in Sichuan and Kang. Chairman Liu adopted the opinions I contributed very humbly, and then repeatedly discussed them based on these opinions and submitted them to Chairman Chiang for approval. Finally, the formal decision on the Sichuan-Kang military reorganization plan was made. This plan was telegraphed to Chairman Liu by the Ministry of Military Affairs on June 22, and then telegraphed to the army commanders. Chairman Liu replied to the Chairman on June 25, expressing his respectful acceptance, and the army commanders also replied one after another, expressing their support. The spirit of Chairman Liu and the army commanders of serving the country impartially is deeply admired. Everyone has seen the original text of the plan, so there is no need to repeat it now. The mission of this meeting is to study the implementation methods based on this plan. At the opening of the meeting, I would like to state two points that I hope for from this meeting: First, the main purpose of this meeting is to thoroughly implement military reorganization in Sichuan and Kang. In other words, it is to nationalize the military in Sichuan and Kang. I hope that everyone will not be polite and will fully explain the current situation of the army and personal opinions orally or in writing for reference in the discussion, so as to determine an implementation step and method that is as perfect as possible. Second, the duration of this meeting is very short, and the duration of the military reorganization is also clearly stipulated in the plan. The standards for all opinions and requests should be based on the principles of the plan and within the limits of what is permitted by the facts and financial resources, and should be proposed with discretion. In general, it is expected that it can be put into practice immediately after the decision. This meeting focuses on researching implementation methods, not on empty talk about theories or making requests and opinions that are too far from reality. I hope everyone will use this short amount of time to express insightful and unique opinions. In short, all the troops in Sichuan and Kang must be thoroughly reorganized to become a modern national army, and all must be commanded and dispatched by the central government to meet the needs of national defense. Only then can we achieve the true purpose of our military reorganization. Finally, I have a few more points to report incidentally: First, our military reorganization is aimed at enriching national defense forces, and the universally implemented military reorganization is to nationalize all local troops with different historical organizations and inconsistent pay scales, rather than reducing or disbanding troops as speculated by the general public, and the central government will not send additional personnel to join the various units. Therefore, the result of the military reorganization is that not only will the strength of the various units not be reduced, but the overall strength will be increased and enriched. Second, recurring expenses will still be organized within the original budget scope, and unnecessary expenses must be effectively saved to improve the treatment of officers and soldiers and supplement weapons, clothing, and agricultural tools. Third, if there are officers and soldiers who are dismissed from the various units, in addition to the old, weak, and disabled, the central government will definitely find ways to settle them, either by sending them to schools for training or by having them settle in the border areas. They will definitely not be left without a livelihood and suffer the pain of being displaced. Fourth, the central government's military reorganization is entirely from the perspective of the country, relieving local difficulties and sharing the responsibility of the generals. Everything is handled with a fair and peaceful attitude, without any prejudice. However, whenever something is handled, there will inevitably be a very small number of people who are used by villains, who, without clarifying the facts, will use all kinds of methods to provoke and alienate, and their intention is nothing more than to hinder the success of the matter and make the country never progress and never unite. I hope that all comrades will pay close attention to prevention, and on the one hand, uphold our spirit of mutual trust, calm down, and discuss a feasible and well-managed step and method openly and honestly. Never listen to the instigation of these people, so that everyone's loyalty, dedication to the country and the people, and painstaking efforts will be in vain, and the great cause of national rejuvenation cannot be completed quickly. This is my sincere hope, and I hope everyone will pay attention to each other and encourage each other, and when you return to your units after the meeting, you must also explain this meaning in detail to the officers and soldiers, so that everyone can deeply understand the significance of the central government's military reorganization and move forward together on the bright road.

<p>Vice Chairman Liu Xiang's Speech</p>
<p>[Chongqing] Liu Xiang's speech at the Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Committee on the morning of the 6th is as follows: Minister He, Director Gu, army commanders, division commanders, officers, today is the first day of the Sichuan-Kang military reorganization meeting. Minister He has clearly stated all the issues and methods related to military reorganization. I originally had nothing more to say, but because the Sichuan-Kang military reorganization is very important, I would like to report a few simple reasons to everyone at today's meeting: First, the principles of Sichuan-Kang military reorganization have long been stipulated by the central government, and the generals at all levels in Sichuan and Kang have unanimously telegraphed their respectful acceptance. Although I have just recovered from illness and fear the fatigue of traveling, I must personally come to Chongqing to participate in the important military reorganization meeting, so that I can be of some help to the smooth progress of military reorganization. I feel that this Sichuan-Kang military reorganization is a necessary requirement of the country. At the same time, from the perspective of our country, I feel that the country's various forces cannot be improved, and we soldiers have a great responsibility. This time, I and the generals telegraphed to the central government to accept the principles of military reorganization, entirely for the benefit of the country and the sincerity of supporting the leader. But with this expression of sincerity, there must be a method of implementation. If there is no appropriate and practical method, it cannot be implemented or cannot be achieved as expected, then the meaning of this meeting will be lost and we will fail to live up to the leader's expectations of us. Therefore, I am attending the meeting despite my illness, hoping that the things discussed at the meeting can proceed smoothly. Second, the significance of military reorganization lies in our ability to implement the expected implementation thoroughly. From the perspective of military reorganization methods, the most important thing is the aftermath of military reorganization. There must be officers and soldiers who are dismissed from the various armies in accordance with the new organization. We have already accepted the principles of military reorganization, but we must have good methods. Therefore, what must be studied at the military reorganization meeting is the issue of the placement of the dismissed officers and soldiers in the future. This is the second significance I want to say today. The above two points of significance are my hopes after accepting the principles of military reorganization. If there is a suitable method for the second point of significance, we believe that military reorganization will be easy and will definitely proceed smoothly and be realized on schedule. This time, Minister He came to Chongqing to preside over this meeting, and we can refer to the local situation at any time in accordance with Minister He's intentions and discuss it together. I will not only contribute opinions, but also the army and division commanders and committee members who participate must also contribute opinions as much as possible. When I arrived in Chongqing yesterday, regarding everything,</p>

<p>[Chongqing] Liu Xiang issued a written statement to visiting reporters today as follows: This time, I was ordered to reorganize the troops in Sichuan and Kang. The significance is extremely important. Reorganizing the organization, enriching the content, and striving to increase the strength of the troops in Sichuan and Kang to be loyal to the Party and the country is an urgent task. Therefore, upon receiving the Chairman's telegram on military reorganization, I sincerely supported the military reorganization methods. Now, the central government has specially sent Minister He and Director Gu to Sichuan to preside over the affairs of the Military Reorganization Committee and appointed me to assist in the management. In order to promote the smooth implementation of military reorganization methods, I am attending the meeting in Chongqing despite my long-term illness. At this meeting, I do not have any special proposals, but in view of the responsibilities of my original position, Minister He and Director Gu have places to consult, and I will naturally do my best to contribute or assist Minister He and Director Gu in completing their mission. If there are difficulties in any of the troops due to reorganization that should be forwarded, I will also discuss with Minister He and Director Gu to forward them to the Chairman and provide appropriate solutions. Therefore, the smooth progress of this military reorganization meeting can be asserted. Regarding the settlement of the dismissed officers and soldiers of the various troops, the army and division commanders have repeatedly stated, and I have also briefly seen it in the newspapers. I am discussing a specific method with Minister He and Director Gu and will immediately submit it to the Chairman for approval. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Sheng Shicai's Representative Discussed the One-Time Turmoil in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>The Commander of the Sixth Division was used by others, Suddenly Rebelled Against the Provincial Government, Pacified and Reorganized by Sheng Shicai</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Zhao Guoyuan, representative of Xinjiang Governor Sheng Shicai, arrived in Nanjing and stated that Ma Buti, commander of the Sixth Division of Xinjiang, suddenly rebelled against the provincial government, obviously used by a certain country. Two months ago, Governor Sheng Shicai deployed troops to suppress them. Ma's division was defeated and retreated towards the Indian border. At that time, the provincial army did not pursue them aggressively, still hoping for a final awakening. However, Ma Buti regrouped on the border and received a large amount of military equipment and funding from a certain country, and launched a counterattack. After several days of fighting, Ma was defeated on the 30th. Sheng resolved the situation, and all the troops of the Sixth Division were reorganized, and the situation is now calm. The Xinjiang Provincial Government is currently implementing a three-year economic plan. In addition to the fact that economic construction has certain limits, the military aspect is that Xinjiang is divided into several reclamation areas, each with a garrison of troops engaged in reclamation. In the first year of reclamation, seeds and funds are provided by the government, and the military's salary remains the same. In the second year, in addition to the salary remaining the same, seeds and funds are halved. In the third year, seeds and funds will be self-sufficient in each reclamation area, and the government will supervise. In the future, production and economic development will gradually become independent and will be able to repay the various expenses subsidized by the government. This is beneficial to the government, the army, and the people. The people of Xinjiang are of both Han and Hui ethnicities. Among the Hui people, there are Chanhui and other Hui people. The Hui people account for 85% of the province's population. Previously, provincial administration and military power were controlled by the Han people, and the Hui people had no opportunity to participate in military and political affairs. All treatments were not equal between Han and Hui ethnic groups, and they were often hostile to each other. In Xinjiang, there was a major massacre every forty years and a minor massacre every ten years. Now the politics of Xinjiang have changed, and all ethnic groups are equal. For example, the administrative head of each county has Hui people participating. The ethnic boundary has been eliminated, and massacres have not occurred in recent years. Four years ago, there were only more than 600 students in Xinjiang, and only dozens of schools. Now the number of schools has increased to more than 1,500, and the number of students has increased to 4 million, and primary school students do not have to pay tuition. The promotion of education is extremely rapid. Due to transportation reasons, most of the local products are sold to the Soviet Union, and in exchange for machinery and various items and tools. The Xinjiang Provincial Government Governor's Office does employ Soviet consultants and technicians, but there is no special political relationship with the Soviet Union. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The situation in Xinjiang is chaotic, and telegrams between Beiping and Xinjiang have been blocked for many days. However, mail to Xinjiang is still being accepted and dispatched as usual, so there is a large backlog of mail in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Suiyuan. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industries Announces Measures to Suppress Speculation in Exchanges</h3>
<p>Prices of Government Bonds and Securities are Not Restricted</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Industries, considering that cotton cloth, flour, miscellaneous grains, and oil cakes are all essential daily necessities for the people, and that their price fluctuations, if they exceed normal limits or are incompatible with market supply and demand, will not only affect the people's daily lives, but also may cause fluctuations in other commodity prices and the rural economy. The unanimous rise in market prices of various exchanges in Shanghai this time is unprecedented in recent years. Various industry associations and related parties in Shanghai have successively requested the establishment of measures to suppress speculation and, if necessary, to limit buying and selling prices to stabilize prices. Therefore, the Ministry, in accordance with the instructions of Premier Jiang, has successively drafted: ㊀ Twelve articles on measures to suppress speculation in the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Exchange, ㊁ Eleven articles on measures to suppress speculation in the Shanghai Exchange of Chinese Machine-Made Flour, and ㊂ Eleven articles on measures to suppress speculation in the Shanghai Exchange of Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes. All were promulgated and implemented on the 6th. As flour and wheat are the two most important commodities for the people's livelihood, the Ministry, based on the daily closing prices of each exchange last month, considered a suitable and reasonable maximum price and ordered that all future buying and selling should not exceed this maximum price. On the one hand, this will prevent speculators from having the opportunity to raise prices and manipulate the market. If there is a need to change this maximum price in the future, the Ministry will re-examine and approve it in consideration of the actual market situation. The buying and selling of government bonds and various securities are different from flour and wheat. The current social and financial situation is good, and the market is gradually becoming prosperous. The rise in government bonds is an inevitable trend, and the government has no reason to restrict prices. In addition, for commodities traded on various exchanges that are not related to the people's daily lives, there is no need to impose restrictions on their buying and selling prices. However, if there is speculation and manipulation, it should be investigated according to the law and will not be tolerated. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Industry announced on the 6th the measures to suppress speculation.

<h3>The Unfolding Situation in Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Conference commenced yesterday in Chongqing. Chief Commissioner He Yingqin and Deputy Chief Commissioners Gu Zhutong and Liu Xiang arrived beforehand to preside over the conference. Various reorganization committee members, such as Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, Yang Sen, Pan Wenhua, He Guoguang, Xia Douyin, and others, along with leading figures from various regions, are assisting in this grand undertaking. Military colleagues are gathered in one place, sharing the same aspirations. Never before has a conference of Sichuan generals been as organized and solemn as this. It is expected that the discussions will cover extensive and significant strategies. Not only will the military reorganization plan be implemented on schedule, but there is also hope for a renewal of the Sichuan situation. Therefore, we spare no effort in focusing our full enthusiasm on the progress of this conference.</p>
<p>When the military reorganization plan was first proposed, letters and envoys flew back and forth, seeking opinions. The spring clouds briefly appeared but were soon overshadowed by doubts. The complexity of the Sichuan situation made it difficult to resolve quickly, and the long distances created many obstacles. With troublemakers stirring things up, it was hard to believe that the matter could be settled. However, as the negotiations became more concrete, all parties expressed their support. The National Government even issued a clear order to establish the Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Committee and drafted its organizational outline. Now, central government officials have arrived in Sichuan with earnest intentions, and the official conference is being convened as scheduled. Our excessive worries have been dispelled. Before He Yingqin's arrival in Chongqing, there was already a prevailing sense of optimism. There may have been room for last-minute reversals, but with the conference convened, it has reached the stage of implementing the plan, and there should be no possibility of conflicting principles. This is the first thing that makes us feel gratified. He Yingqin issued a written statement immediately after disembarking from the plane, solemnly declaring that the significance of the military reorganization lies solely in enhancing the quality of the troops. The actual number of personnel will not be reduced, and funding will not be cut. Supernumerary officers will be resettled. The central government will not insert personnel. The difference from the past is that the organization, personnel, funding, and education after the reorganization will be directly under the central government. Some generals other than Liu Xiang may not fully understand the motives for the reorganization, fearing the reduction of their subordinates and the restriction of their power. Military minds are not good at analysis, and suspicion can easily lead to misunderstandings. Now, He Yingqin has clarified everything that they are concerned about, which will surely put the generals at ease and inspire them to unite and work hard. Therefore, there should be no major obstacles at the conference table. This is the second thing that makes us feel gratified.</p>
<p>Regarding the merits and demerits of military reorganization, we have already published commentaries. Now, speaking specifically about Sichuan, we feel that the outcome of this conference has the potential to lead Sichuan on a path of renewal. The fact that military personnel in Sichuan have been building their own strongholds and engaging in mutual killings for a long time has created a fragmented and chaotic situation. As a result, the people are impoverished, the land is barren, the provincial treasury is depleted, and vitality is lost. Frequent disasters have made it impossible to survive. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity for generals from all sides to meet in one room, it is time to repent, reflect earnestly, abandon prejudices, and cooperate for mutual progress. We believe that the formation of all animosity is partly due to misunderstandings. If they can be open and honest and communicate regularly, there is no reason why they cannot dispel past grievances. Moreover, after the reorganization, there will be no more factions. As members of the same national army, they should think about coexisting. Sichuan is known as the Land of Abundance, with abundant resources and rich mineral deposits. Cultivation and development depend on human effort. How to utilize the assistance of the military to revive Sichuan should be thoroughly considered at this conference.</p>
<h3>American and British Airplanes Successfully Cross the Atlantic in Opposite Directions</h3>
<p>Meeting in the Sky and Arriving at Their Destinations Almost Simultaneously - Scheduled Transatlantic Air Service Can Be Launched</p>
<p>[London] Yesterday's transatlantic trial flight by American and British airplanes marked a new page in aviation history and the beginning of scheduled flights between the United States and Britain in the future. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>[London] The significant transatlantic trial flight was successfully completed today. The 18-ton British Airways flying boat Caledonia and the Pan American Airways Sikorsky flying boat arrived safely at their destinations within minutes of each other. According to British Imperial Airways, the American Sikorsky flying boat flew 1,960 miles at an average speed of 156 miles per hour, while the British flying boat Caledonia flew 1,990 miles at an average speed of 132 miles per hour due to headwinds and fog along the way, resulting in a lower speed. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>[London] The Pan American Airways seaplane "Pan American Clipper" and the British Imperial Airways seaplane "Caledonia" departed from Newfoundland and Foynes Island in Southern Ireland, respectively, for trial flights to establish a scheduled air service.

<p>After departing from Newfoundland, the "Pan American Clipper" landed in the waters off Foynes Island this morning at 10:47 a.m., taking a total of 12 hours and 40 minutes. Over a thousand local residents warmly cheered Captain Gray and the six other pilots. President de Valera of the Irish Free State Executive Council, Minister of Industry and Commerce Lemass, representatives from the British Air Ministry and British Imperial Airways were all waiting on land and welcomed the airmen. Captain Gray then made a speech, saying, "We had favorable winds on this trip and encountered no difficulties, which is very gratifying. We only encountered rain and clouds when flying near the coast of Southern Ireland, which made it slightly gloomy. The weather conditions along the way were consistent with the meteorological forecasts. This is a great victory for meteorologists."</p>
<p>After departing from Foynes Island in Southern Ireland, the Caledonia met the "Pan American Clipper" midway and flew to the waters off Newfoundland at 9:20 a.m. Suddenly, it encountered heavy fog, delaying its landing at Botwood Harbor until 10:06 a.m., taking a total of 15 hours and 11 minutes. After receiving the news, British Air Minister Lord Swinton immediately sent a telegram to Captain Wilcockson, the pilot, congratulating him, and also congratulated Captain Gray, the pilot of the Pan American Clipper. (Central News Agency, Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>[London] This agency has just received a telegram from the Imperial Airways' giant seaplane "Caledonia" stating that it encountered the Pan American Airways seaplane "Pan American Clipper" over the Atlantic Ocean at 5 a.m. this morning. The "Caledonia" departed from Southampton on the 4th of this month for its first transatlantic scheduled commercial flight, while the "Pan American Clipper" departed from Port Washington, Florida, USA, on the morning of the 3rd of this month for a connecting flight for scheduled air service between Europe and America.

<h3>American Female Aviator Feared Lost in the Pacific Ocean</h3>
<p>Naval Ships and Airplanes Search Without Success - Signals Received Are Unreliable</p>
<p>◎ Honolulu: Approximately 3,500 American naval personnel and radio operators are participating in the search for female aviator Oerl Har in the Pacific Ocean, along with the American aircraft carrier Lexington and four destroyers. As of tonight, the hope of finding her is very slim. (National, 6th)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The Coast Guard cutter Itasca glimpsed a flare launched by aviator Oerl Har 281 nautical miles from Howland Island and immediately advanced at full speed. Upon hearing the news, people thought that Oerl Har could be rescued and celebrated. However, the Itasca sent a telegram this morning at 10:25 a.m. stating that the flare was also seen on Howland Island, or it could be a shooting star. The ship is still using searchlights and sending radio signals to continue the search. (Central News Agency, Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>◎ Honolulu: People here are gradually believing that American female aviator Oerl Har crashed 281 miles north of Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean. The American Coast Guard cutter "Itasca" is now rushing to the rescue and is expected to arrive at its destination at 8:30 p.m. today. Whether Ms. Oerl will be rescued remains questionable. At 4:00 a.m. this morning, the destroyer "Moultray" arrived 90 miles northeast of Howland Island, and the "Swan" arrived 410 miles northeast of the island. It is now learned that Ms. Oerl crashed north of Howland, and the ships are all searching northward. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>Moscow's New Canal</h3>
<p>128 Kilometers Long - Opening in Mid-July</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union decided to officially open the Moscow-Volga Canal on July 15th. (National Hai Tong Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet newspapers commented on the government's resolution regarding the completion of the Moscow-Volga Canal, pointing out the great achievement of creating one of the world's largest navigable canals in four years. The canal will draw water from the Volga River to Moscow to supply water to the capital and connect Moscow to the Volga River with the shortest waterway, shortening the waterway from the capital to Leningrad by 1,100 kilometers and to Gorky by 110 kilometers. The canal is 128 kilometers long and has 240 structures such as pumping stations, hydroelectric power plants, and dams, with a construction cost of approximately 1.8 billion rubles. (TASS, 5th)</p>
<h3>South Manchuria Railway Company's Financial Difficulties</h3>
<p>Various New Projects Face Challenges in Progress</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Due to financial constraints, the South Manchuria Railway Company (Mantetsu) is facing great difficulties in undertaking various new projects. Since this year, those capable of investing in Mantetsu have not shown enthusiasm. Therefore, Mantetsu was only able to issue bonds worth 25 million yen in the first half of the year. Mantetsu relied on this amount and the 20 million yen in equity payments from the Japanese government to operate in the first half of the year. In order to realize the various projects planned for the second half of the year, Mantetsu needs 20 million yen in July, 10 million yen in August, and 20 million yen in September, totaling 50 million yen. Mantetsu is currently negotiating with banking syndicates to obtain the above funds and is trying to borrow 10 million yen to meet urgent needs. However, the banking syndicates have clearly expressed their unwillingness to lend more money to Mantetsu. Therefore, how the negotiations will proceed is noteworthy. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Palestine Divided into Three Zones</h3>
<p>Arabs and Jews Both Oppose</p>
<p>◎ Jerusalem: The United States has mobilized 8,000 troops stationed in Palestine to prevent disturbances after the committee publishes its report. The authorities have also published leaflets in Arabic, Hebrew, and English, preparing to declare martial law if necessary. British and Egyptian troops are now arriving daily, in addition to 3,300 police officers, 900 policemen, and 2,200 border guards, to assist. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>[London] Informed sources here say that the Palestine Committee is about to submit a report recommending that Palestine be divided into three parts: a Jewish state, an Arab state, and a neutral zone under British rule. According to reliable sources, the Jewish state will occupy two-thirds of the area of Palestine, with Haifa or Tel Aviv as its capital, and will be named "State of Israel." Its political system will be a republic. The remaining one-third, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Nazareth, will be designated as a British-administered area. A "corridor" from the Arab state to the coast will also be under British administration. The Arab state will include the mountainous region of Jordan, which will be governed by the local chieftain. The 250,000 Arabs scattered throughout Palestine will be forcibly relocated to the Arab state, and the relocation costs will be borne by Britain. According to informed sources, this new arrangement will be implemented on January 1, 1940. (National Hai Tong Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>◎ Jerusalem: The Palestine Committee is about to submit a report recommending that Palestine be divided into three parts. Most Jewish newspapers have expressed opposition. Among the Arabs, opinions are divided. The Mufti faction opposes the partition, while the Nashashibi faction supports it. It has been learned from British sources here that, to prevent disputes when the report is published, preparations have been made to transport Egyptian troops to Palestine by plane in case of emergency. If riots occur, martial law will be declared, and the proclamation has already been printed. (National Hai Tong Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Inspection Group Arrives in Britain - Kadono Gives Speech</h3>
<p>Difficult to Speak Due to Competitive Position between Japan and Britain - Japan Ready to Cooperate with Britain on the China Issue</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese business inspection group to Britain, led by Kadono Jukuro, arrived in London on the afternoon of the 5th. The following passage from Kadono's speech to the Japanese press corps is noteworthy: "Japan and Britain are in a competitive position, making it difficult to speak. Especially on trade issues, if the remarks are not careful, they will inevitably involve the global market, which will greatly hinder Japan's developing trade. However, on the China issue, Japan is fully prepared to cooperate with Britain and believes there is room for discussion, which may lead to unexpected developments. He believes that public and private sectors in Japan have reached a consensus on acknowledging British interests in China and the possibility of a lasting partnership between Japan and Britain. He will strive to find ways to promote economic cooperation between Japan and Britain." (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>

<h3>New Developments in the Attitude of Various Countries Towards the Situation in Spain</h3>
<p>Diplomatic Negotiations on Compromise Mature - Rebel Authorities Allow British Mine to Resume Operations</p>
<p>[London] Reuters learned today that after repeated consideration, the British government still believes that it is most appropriate for Britain and France to fill the gap after the withdrawal of German and Italian warships and take on the task of supervision, which will surely be supported by the world. The British government's previous opposition to the German and Italian plan to recognize the Spanish belligerents as having belligerent rights remains unchanged. However, it is actively seeking a solution and has proposed placing observers at Spanish ports, giving them the right to inspect all goods and foreign ships entering Spain. Although this proposal may not be agreed to by the Spanish belligerents, it may be studied by the Non-Intervention Committee. If volunteer soldiers withdraw from Spain and the war becomes a purely Spanish war, the British government will be even more willing to consider granting both sides belligerent rights. This is undoubtedly the case. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>[London] The iron ore mine in Volozera, near Bilbao, Spain, which was originally invested in and operated by a British mining company, was shut down after fighting broke out near Bilbao. Now that Bilbao has been occupied by the Spanish Nationalist forces, the British Commercial Attaché in Spain, Mr. Barker, negotiated with the Nationalist authorities. As a result, General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, has approved the British mining company to resume work at the iron ore mine. It is now learned that in addition to the British Commercial Attaché's negotiations, Mr. Bolín, General Franco's special envoy to Britain, also mediated. Mr. Bolín was formerly a London correspondent for the Spanish newspaper ABC and is currently the director of the information and propaganda department of the Nationalist government. He recently led two subordinates to Britain for a few days to try to improve relations between Britain and the Spanish Nationalist government. (Central News Agency, Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>[Rome] There is hope for easing the international tension caused by the Spanish issue. Italian political figures have expressed their welcome. It is rumored that Italian Prime Minister Ciano may come forward to mediate, which is appropriate and would be welcomed here. Italian political figures believe that it is not difficult for Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to reach a compromise and are confident that any actions that may hinder such a compromise will be avoided by Britain.

<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden recently announced in the House of Commons that the Adjustment Committee for the Non-Intervention Plan in the Spanish Civil War is scheduled to meet on the 9th of this month to discuss the new plan for maritime supervision in Spain. (Central News Agency, Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Returns Home for Instructions Before Returning to Post and Meeting with British Foreign Secretary</h3>
<p>Comprehensive Discussion of Overall Issues - British Ambassador Also Visits German Foreign Minister</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden met with French Ambassador Corbin this morning and had a long discussion on the new plan for maritime supervision in Spain and the overall issues of the Non-Intervention Agreement in the Civil War. It is rumored that British Ambassador to Germany Sir Henderson told German Foreign Minister Neurath yesterday that if foreign volunteers can withdraw from Spain, Britain intends to recognize the belligerents in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent entities. This needs to be denied by the British government. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Spanish issue, it is heard that the British side believes that the Spanish Civil War is now in danger of developing into an international conflict. If it is desired to limit its scope to a normal civil war, the only practical step is to withdraw all foreign volunteers currently fighting in Spain. For this reason, if the relevant countries can reach an agreement on the withdrawal of volunteers, Britain is willing to recognize the belligerents in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent entities. Regarding this, French Ambassador to Britain Corbin recently returned to Paris to seek instructions from his Foreign Minister Delbos and has now returned to London. He will hold talks with Foreign Secretary Eden this evening or tomorrow, at which time the situation should become clearer. According to diplomatic sources, France will likely continue to oppose recognizing the belligerents, but will definitely support Britain's firm advocacy of the withdrawal of volunteers. Therefore, according to observers, this issue may reach a compromise on the following outline: ㊀ If the maritime supervision plan cannot be maintained, then a new path must be found, replacing maritime supervision with port supervision in Spain. Observers should be stationed at all Spanish ports and have the right to board foreign ships to conduct inspections. This suggestion is sure to be approved by Germany and Italy. ㊁ After abandoning the maritime supervision system, Britain and France should resolutely insist that not only should the foreign volunteers currently fighting in Spain be withdrawn, but the principles of non-intervention and supervision should also be applied to the air force. It is heard that Germany is willing to accept the method of withdrawing volunteers, but Italy is not. As for the belligerents in the Spanish Civil War, if the London Adjustment Committee proposes to withdraw all foreign volunteers, the Valencia Republican government will surely accept it, but the Nationalist side may reject it. However, informed sources with close ties to Nationalist Commander-in-Chief General Franco say that Franco has recently changed his attitude and may be able to accept the method of withdrawing volunteers. (Central News Agency, Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Political circles here believe that British Ambassador Henderson's visit to German Foreign Minister Neurath yesterday was because the British government wanted to inquire whether Germany intends to put forward new suggestions at the next meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee. It is expected that Neurath has given a negative answer. According to political speculation, the British Ambassador's visit was purely an inquiry and did not represent the British government in putting forward any new suggestions.

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Explains Current Situation</h3>
<p>No German Warships Currently in the Mediterranean</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden, in answering questions from various members of parliament in the House of Commons today, explained the situation in Spain after Germany and Italy rejected the British and French supervision plans, stating that the subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee decided to submit the British and French plans and the German and Italian counterproposals to all countries participating in the Adjustment Committee so that the committee could hold a plenary meeting within this week to discuss them. As for the issue of withdrawing volunteers from various countries in Spain, it is still on the agenda of the Adjustment Committee. The British government hopes that this issue can be further discussed in the near future. The Foreign Secretary then answered a question from the opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee, stating that there are currently no German warships in the Mediterranean. Conservative MP Sandy then asked, "The government previously stated that recognizing the belligerents in the Spanish Civil War as having belligerent rights does not conflict with the non-intervention policy. Is the Adjustment Committee considering using the recognition of belligerent rights as a compromise solution, but not to replace the supervision system, but only to supplement this system? Can Foreign Secretary Eden inform us of this?" The Foreign Secretary replied that the proposal is currently being discussed, but there are a large number of foreign nationals currently in Spain, thus creating a special situation in Spain. As for the recognition of belligerent rights, it is not regarded as a replacement for the entire supervision plan. (Central News Agency, Havas, 5th)</p>

<h3>England and America Actively Strengthen Military Preparations</h3>
<p>Dictatorial Countries Should Be Wary – Speech by US Ambassador to England</p>
<p>[London] US Ambassador to England, Bingham, recently gave a speech here on the American Independence Day, stating, “The military buildup of England and the United States is actually caused by the coercion of dictatorial countries. We hope that before the outbreak of World War II, it will serve as a warning to warmongers. Looking around the world, democratic countries are thriving, while people under dictatorial political rule are becoming increasingly impoverished and enslaved. In short, the rearmament policy of England and the United States is the greatest pillar of peace. I personally hope that within these dictatorial countries, there are still people with reason and sound minds. They must understand that if they engage in an arms race with England and the United States, the result will undoubtedly be defeat.” (Central News Agency, May 5th, Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>A Record of the International Exposition of Art and Technology (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xiaoke</p>
<p>Now we divide the French section's buildings into three groups: specialized, regional, and colonial. There are a total of two hundred and thirty-six halls and buildings. Due to space limitations, we can only describe the general outline. Now we select the important ones and briefly describe one or two:</p>
<p>The specialized group includes:</p>
<p>Railway Building, Modern Art Building (solidly built, prepared for preservation), Printing and Publishing Industry Building, Public Education Building, Science and Invention Building, Radio Building, Travel Building, Merchant Ship Building, Aviation Building, Newspaper Office, Tavern, Hygiene Hall, etc…</p>
<p>Public Education Building – located in Champ-de-Mars. It is divided into elementary and advanced education, vocational education, and other groups. The first floor represents seventy-two thousand schools, including children's schools, elementary schools, high schools, and normal schools. There are many models of newly built elementary schools on display. Fifty million francs have been spent on this improvement over the past decade. Advanced education displays models of famous architectural structures in French culture, such as the National Library of Versailles, Casa Velasquez in Madrid, the University District of Ronci, and the new nursing school in Lyon. There are also handwritten manuscripts of writers during their university years. Advanced education has no spatial or temporal limits, and from the same level, it continues from elementary education and introduces the portals of various knowledge. Anyone concerned with education should not miss this place.</p>
<p>Science and Invention Building – As the name suggests, the things displayed in this building represent the processes of various new inventions over the years applied to modern life. We know that if there were no inventions of Voltaire and Ampere, the application of electricity would not be as widespread as it is today. Without Lavoisier's inventions, the chemical industry would not have the development it has today. Just looking at botany in the biology group, Professor Braylinham is in charge. During the exposition, he uses scientific principles to instruct the audience on all flowers in sequence. Every day at 5 pm, he uses film to popularize scientific knowledge to the public. There have also been improvements in grape cultivation in France over the past fifty years. Plant pathology also retains a large portion of the space. There is also a section for various strange dwarf plants (the so-called Japanese-style gardens), proving that future city dwellers can install a small garden at home that is laid out like a large park. Isn't this the connection between science applied to art and technology?</p>
<p>Women and Children's Family Hall – The organizers of the exposition did not neglect this important social issue. A total of seven pavilions were built, representing all of France's social charities for children and women. Questions about women's career inclinations and other issues can be answered and introduced. There is also a small park with all the entertainment organizations for children.</p>
<p>Aviation Building – located in Invalides Square and in front of its station, 180 meters long and 36 meters wide. The front protrudes into a conical and transparent shape. It displays the latest French military aircraft: Nieuport 761, Hanriot 220, Potez 63, Morane 405, Hanriot 782, and Breguet 730. At night, you can see the huge silhouettes of the planes from the outside. The top floor of the building is a large dining hall, operated by the transatlantic shipping company, the Normandy Grand Mail Ship. Outside the house, there is a small aviation parachute landing tower, 65 meters high, with safety equipment, for tourists to try landing for the first time. During the exposition, the aviation competitions include: the aviation grand review on July 14, the public aviation day on August 29, and the international aviation speed and competition race on October 3.</p>
<p>The famous French national tapestry factory, Gobelin, has been preparing for two years to weave 150 square meters of precious paintings for the exhibition. The factory was established in the fifteenth century and produces 65 square meters of tapestry annually. Each technician can only weave one square meter per year. Among the exhibits is a large tapestry "Peace" 5 meters 20 inches long and 4 meters wide, which will be used to decorate the new League of Nations building after the exhibition.</p>

<h3>Soviet Literary Giant Gorky's Letter to Mr. Sun Yat-sen</h3>
<p>Brothers in Spirit, Comrades in Method – Hoping to Work Together to Eliminate Hatred Among People</p>
<p>June 18th is the anniversary of the death of the great Soviet writer Gorky. The Soviet Union held a grand memorial service nationwide. The Soviet newspapers published a letter from Gorky to Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the autumn of 1912. At that time, Gorky was the editor of the "Modern" newspaper, which had a column called "Foreign Life," and the letter was published in it. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Yixian:</p>
<p>I am a Russian, fighting for the victory of the same ideals as you. Wherever this ideal triumphs, I share your joy. I congratulate you on the outstanding success of your work. All conscientious people pay attention to this success, and feel happy and amazed for you—the Chinese Hercules.</p>
<p>We Russians also expect what you have accomplished. We are brothers in spirit and comrades in method, but the Russian government and its slaves put the Russian people in the position of enemies of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>We socialists, we deeply believe that people all over the world can and will live a fraternal life. Can we ignore and let greedy and stupid people promote the development of ethnic hatred, and thus perhaps cause the future of socialism to encounter dark and solid walls?</p>
<p>On the contrary, we will use all our strength to destroy the attempts of our enemies, the enemies of all good people in the world, who are preparing to extinguish the sun in order to carry out their dark and greedy tricks, spread hatred in the world, and suppress the enemies of the people.</p>
<p>We socialists must declare as often as possible that there is hatred between governments in the world, but there should be no hatred between people, this hatred is being aroused by the ruling class. Mr. Yixian, I implore you to write an article on the following topic: What is the attitude of the Chinese in general and individually towards the European capital's attempt to invade, and what is their attitude towards the actions of Russian capitalists and the Russian government? What are these actions, and what kind of opposition do they encounter from your people? If you do not have time to write it yourself, please entrust your friend to write it, and correct it yourself. When writing, please use any European language and send it to my mailing address.</p>
<p>I am asking you this because Russians must know about the regeneration of China from honest Chinese, and not from European journalists who serve capitalism.</p>
<p>I have seen the paper you wrote in "The Activities of a Socialist" and read your notes. I deeply admire you and am sure that you will be willing to answer my request. Gorky in Capri, Italy, October 28th. (TASS)</p>

<h3>Traitors Liu Guitang and Bai Jianwu Conspire to Disrupt the Security of Tianjin and Other Places</h3>
<p>Collecting Scattered Bandits to Form a Puppet Anti-Communist Army – Our Side is on Alert, Security is Not a Concern</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence, In the past week, there have been many rumors about security in Tianjin and its surrounding areas. At the end of last month, the Tianjin municipal authorities received a confidential report stating that traitors Liu Guitang and Bai Jianwu had received 500,000 yuan in funding from a certain source to form a North China puppet anti-communist army. They were collecting two to three thousand scattered bandits to go to the border of Chahar and Suiyuan to increase the strength of the puppet army. The organization of the troops was being prepared in "Jidong." Yin Ni and Yin Ni's cronies, Li Ni Binzhang and Liu Ni Zongji, were also assisting in everything under the orders of a certain source. After departing along the Great Wall line, they would harass Tianjin and the surrounding areas of Daxing County and Lugouqiao. If they could proceed smoothly, they would unite with the spies lurking on the Pinghan Railway to harass Baoding. The Beiping municipal authorities, to guard against any eventuality, began to implement summer defense early on June 27. The inner and outer three cities were heavily guarded by the 29th Army assisting the police force. At the same time, they began searching for traitors. On the 28th and 29th, several wanted criminals were captured at the Qianmen Railway Station. All had evidence of plotting wrongdoing, further confirming the rumor that traitors were causing trouble. Tianjin is close to Beiping, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. On the evening of the 30th, Tianjin heard that Beiping and Baoding had been placed under martial law, causing considerable anxiety. However, the Tianjin local area relied on the strength of the three thousand police officers, and the deployment was very thorough. From the 1st, special precautions were taken during the summer defense period: ㊀ Joint defense was carried out with the water and sea police bureaus to ensure the safety of the Haihe waterway. ㊁ Joint defense and patrols were carried out with the police bureaus of Tianjin and Ninghe counties until the green gauze tents disappeared. According to the authorities, the security is absolutely guaranteed. (4th)</p>
<h3>Traitor Li Yicai Arrested in Bengbu</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence, Li Yicai, the main culprit of the Jinxiandao, who was wanted by the public, was used by a certain source to preach in Bengbu under the guise of spreading the gospel, secretly plotting wrongdoing. He was recently arrested with his partisan Zhang Yongzhen by the local garrison. After repeated interrogations, his confession was cunning. Li's followers numbered over a thousand and were quite active among the traitors. He and Gu Shuaiyuan, the main culprit of the Holy Sages Society, who was also arrested, are being held in the division headquarters.</p>
<h3>Foreign Nationals in Xiamen Refuse to Pay Income Tax</h3>
<p>Japanese Nationals and Taiwanese Also Refuse Investigation – Income Tax Office Issues Another Notice Demanding Payment</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, Foreign nationals and citizens in Xiamen refuse to pay income tax. Japanese nationals and Taiwanese citizens also refuse investigation, declaring that citizens are not obligated to pay income tax. In response, the Fujian Income Tax Office issued another notice on July 3, urging foreign nationals and citizens to pay according to regulations. If they still deliberately delay, it will be handled according to regulations. The original text of the notice reads: "The Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulate the scope of taxation, divided into three categories: Category 1: Profit-making business income, A. Profit-making income of companies, merchants, firms, factories, or individuals with capital of more than 2,000 yuan, B. Profit-making income of official-merchant joint ventures, C. Profit-making income belonging to temporary business. Category 2: Salary income of civil servants, freelancers, and others engaged in various industries. Category 3: Income from public bonds, corporate bonds, stocks, and deposit interest. The income tax on civil servants' salary income and public bond interest income has been levied since October 1st of last year, and other categories have also been levied since January 1st of this year, all of which have been ordered by our National Government to be followed. All foreign nationals, regardless of nationality, living in the Republic of China, whose source of income comes from within this province, should report and pay taxes to this office as soon as possible. However, many are still watching and hesitating, which is not in accordance with international practice. This office feels deeply regretful and hopes that all foreign nationals and citizens will deeply understand the way to cultivate friendly relations and quickly pay the income tax payable in accordance with the various provisions of our country's Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Implementation Rules, either by self-payment or withholding, to the Central Bank nearby, and at the same time fill out the current standard form and send it directly to this office for review and registration. Do not delay. If there is still deliberate negligence in the future, this office will handle it in accordance with the provisions of Articles 18 to 20 of the Provisional Regulations. Do not say that you were not warned. This notice is hereby issued to foreign nationals and citizens in this province." It is reported that Japanese nationals and Taiwanese citizens account for the majority of foreign nationals in Xiamen, accounting for about one-tenth of the population of Xiamen. Their income also accounts for one-tenth of the total income of Xiamen. Therefore, if they can be made to comply, there will be no problem with other foreign nationals. (4th)</p>
<h3>Yang Yongnian Discusses Fujian Province's Epidemic Prevention Plan, Emphasizing Fundamental Work</h3>
<p>The Epidemic Atmosphere in Southern Fujian Turns Fierce Again – More Than 400 People Have Died in Xianyou County</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence, Yang Yongnian, a special epidemic prevention commissioner sent by the Ministry of Health, went to Beijing to discuss the province's five-year epidemic prevention plan with the Ministry of Health. Now that the matter is over, he flew to the province on the 1st of this month with Dr. Hou Zonglian, the newly hired president of the Provincial Medical College, and nutrition expert Cheng Li. He immediately went to the provincial government to report on the results of the negotiations in Beijing. According to him, the province's five-year epidemic prevention plan has been approved by the Executive Yuan and can be started immediately. In addition to establishing a provincial epidemic prevention office in Quanzhou, a branch will be established in northern and western Fujian. The northern Fujian epidemic prevention affairs have been established in Jian'ou, and the western Fujian epidemic prevention office is planned to be established in Longyan. Offices will be established in counties with epidemics. The expenses will be jointly borne by the province and the central government. Previously, due to limited financial resources, only emergency rescue and prevention and other temporary measures could be taken. In the future, research work will be planned, and the most scientific methods will be adopted for systematic research to carry out fundamental work. As for the provincial government, Chairman Chen pays great attention to the general public's clothing, food, housing, and hygiene. Regarding housing, the Health Section of the Civil Affairs Department has built a model hygiene residence outside the Shuibu Gate in the provincial capital as an experiment. If it can meet the needs of the countryside, it can be gradually promoted to various counties. Regarding food, Cheng Li, who came with him this time, will be hired to specialize in nutrition and hygiene affairs. Mr. Yang himself is scheduled to go to Quanzhou on the 7th to inspect the provincial epidemic prevention office. On the 11th, he will go to Xiamen. On the 17th, he will take a ship to Java to attend the World Epidemic Prevention Conference in August. He will return to China at the end of August. Mr. Yang also plans to take the opportunity to inspect epidemic prevention affairs in Java to serve as a reference for our country's epidemic prevention.</p>
<p>In the coastal areas of southern Fujian, Fuzhou, Putian, Xianyou, Hui'an, Jinjiang, and Yongchun counties, the plague was discovered in the late spring and early summer of this year and spread widely. After the government and the people worked together to prevent and control it, it subsided. However, in the past half month, it has been raining continuously, and the weather has been sultry. The epidemic atmosphere has turned fierce again, especially in Putian and Xianyou counties. In Xianyou County alone, more than 400 people have died recently. The seriousness of the situation can be imagined. The provincial government has ordered the Health Section of the Civil Affairs Department to rush personnel and medicines to put it out. (July 3)</p>

The Construction and Defense Office reported to the provincial government and the Yellow River Conservancy Association. At the same time, it allocated piles, rope, sacks, and stones, and ordered the soldiers to protect them. Because the dikes of Wulongtan in Changqing County were incomplete, the county magistrate was ordered to quickly repair them. As for the Huainan Dam, more than three thousand five hundred people were working on the top every day, and 50% of the work has been completed. Wang Kairu, the director of the Construction and Defense Office, went to inspect on the 3rd, guided the defense along the river, and telegraphed Kong Xiangrong of the Yellow River Conservancy Association to quickly allocate funds for the project. In the twenty-two counties along the Yellow River, in addition to Heze, Yuncheng, Feicheng, Zhangqiu, Guancheng, Huimin, and Licheng counties, the telephones were used to urge the people to defend them. The county magistrates of the remaining counties were telegraphed to quickly set up shelters for the people.</p>

<p>The Police Station's Lost Gun Incident</p>
<p>The police station's lost gun, the detention of four police officers, etc., were recorded in this newspaper on the 5th. Now we have received a letter from the county police station correcting it, saying, "The news on July 5 in your newspaper that the county police station lost a gun and that four police officers were arrested is quite different from the facts. After the bureau was ordered to reorganize, the special service team's police officers were slightly transferred. After moving the houses, the team leader reported that a pistol belonging to police officer Xu Bingkui was lost. Because the case involved military supplies, police officers Xu Bingkui and Men Shu Zhu Hongsheng were first supervised. Later, it was found that police officers Jiang Fang (not yet appointed) who had passed the examination had been to the police dormitory, so they were also detained. The gun was found in the storage room of the police station. However, whether the police officers' loss of the gun was intentional or negligent is still under investigation to determine responsibility. The above-mentioned process is the fact. A letter is hereby prepared to apply for correction."</p>

<p>Jiangsu Province Promotes the Righteous Picture System</p>
<p>Only Wuxi and Wujin counties in Jiangsu Province have completed the Righteous Picture System. It is reported that the Finance Department has decided to select Zhenjiang, Wujiang, Jiangyin, Jurong, Gaochun, Lishui, Baoshan, and other seven counties that have completed the atlas from this year onwards to promote the system. It has been decided to convene the responsible persons to the province this month to discuss the methods. In August, publicity and preparation will be carried out. In September, pilot projects will be carried out in townships. In October, the counties will plan improvements based on the results of the pilot projects. In November, the counties will promote it universally and complete it by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Liuyu Plans to Build a Sluice Gate</p>
<p>The Jiang'an River in Liuyu on the opposite bank often collapses. This year, it is even worse. It is reported that the construction authorities are currently planning to build several T-shaped sluice gates east of Guazhou and west of Liuyu so that the water flow will reduce its flow rate each time it passes through a gate to reduce the erosion and ensure that the river bank does not collapse again. It is reported that the project will cost at least 600,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Commemorating Water Quality Improvement</p>
<p>Ningbo Tap Water Company has been operating for a year and has gradually improved the water quality. Now that the water source is abundant and the water quality is white, it is highly praised by users. The company held a semi-annual anniversary to commemorate the success of water quality improvement and set the following preferential measures for new households: From July 1 to the end of August: ㊀ The installation fee is reduced by five yuan. ㊁ The installation fee is completely waived for those who jointly report the installation at the same time by three households. ㊂ Those who still pay the installation fee according to regulations are exempted from water charges until the end of this year. ㊃ Retail water tickets are generally 20% off.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry and the Jiangsu Provincial Government have established the Jiangsu Provincial Wheat Inspection Institute to promote the improvement of wheat production and increase the income of farmers. Sub-offices have been established in Zhenjiang and other fourteen places. Tang Yuancheng has been sent to Youchou to prepare for the establishment of the county sub-office, which has been organized and established, and inspection began on the 4th.</p>
<h3>Yuyao</h3>
<p>Preparing to Establish a Food Supply Cooperative</p>
<p>The Yao County government stated that the fields in the coastal areas of the northern countryside are all salt areas and cannot grow grains. Therefore, the food for the salt people depends entirely on supplies from other places. In order to facilitate the purchase of salt people and reduce the exploitation of salt people, the county government plans to establish a food supply cooperative in each township in the salt-producing area to alleviate the suffering of the salt people. The salt industry trade union has been ordered to start organizing.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>The Electricity Tide Mediation Breaks Down</p>
<p>The tide of electricity improvement here has not been resolved for half a month due to the two sides holding on. On the 2nd of this month, Yang Lüqiao and others came forward to mediate. The Hefei All-Circles Electricity Improvement Committee held a general meeting and decided on five conditions, which were handed over to Yang to meet with Gong Yangwu, the manager of the company, for discussion. Gong believed that they could not be accepted and refused. The mediation therefore broke down. The Improvement Committee is currently planning coping measures.</p>
<p>Lu'an Celebrates the Annihilation of the Communists</p>
<p>The people of Lu'an County, western Anhui, stated that the county had been ravaged by the Communists for eight years, and the city was destroyed twice. Fortunately, in the past month, Wei Lihuang, the superintendent of the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, supervised the various armies and severely suppressed them. Now they have all been wiped out. From now on, the people can emerge from the water and fire and ascend to the throne, so they initiated the organization of a meeting to celebrate the elimination of the Communists. Several dragon lanterns and thousands of various colored lanterns were built. On the evening of July 1, a lantern parade began. More than 100,000 citizens watched. It is scheduled to continue on the 2nd and 3rd.</p>
<h3>Baoshan</h3>
<p>Appealing to Exempt the House Tax</p>
<p>The collection of house tax in this county has been decided to be implemented from this year and has been included in the budget by the county government, totaling 4,800 yuan, which will be used for police expenses. The county chamber of commerce and other public groups believe that in addition to the 8,400 yuan that the Shanghai municipal government plans to allocate annually for police expenses, an additional 1% is charged on the deed tax, and 4% is levied on each mu of land. The burden on the people is not small. At present, they have suffered repeated disasters, and the people are in extreme difficulty. Therefore, on the 5th, they telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, appealing to them to consider the local situation and order the exemption of the tax to alleviate the people's hardships.</p>

The chamber of commerce, after consultation with various industries, presented a financial application requesting exemption from the donation.</p>
<h3>Haizhou</h3>
<p>Purchasing Machinery to Mine Mica</p>
<p>The Lin Hai Mica Mine Company of the third district of this county has been producing a substantial amount of mica since it began mining at Qinglong Mountain last year. However, as the mine shafts have become deeper and the mica stones larger, the company felt that relying solely on manual labor was becoming increasingly inefficient. In light of this, the company has temporarily suspended mining operations and sent staff to Shanghai to purchase machinery. Once the machinery arrives, large-scale mining will commence.</p>
<p>Japanese Students Visit Haizhou</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the third, two Japanese individuals arrived in the county town from Muyang by car and stayed at the Dongya Hotel. The local police station dispatched two officers to provide protection. The two Japanese, Nakahara Teruo and Ito Toshio, are students from the Jiangsu-Zhejiang sightseeing class of the Shanghai Toa Dobun Shoin. They are both around twenty years old and can speak fluent Chinese. According to the two, they are taking advantage of the summer vacation to travel to various provinces after leaving Shanghai on June 3rd. They will stay overnight in Xinpu and head to Mount Tai in Shandong tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Sudden Heat Reaches Ninety-Six Degrees</p>
<p>After the Dragon Boat Festival, the weather in Yangzhou was still as cool as mid-autumn, with elderly people wearing lined jackets. On the third, the temperature suddenly rose, and people at home were sweating profusely even when naked. The Fahrenheit thermometer reached ninety-six degrees at noon, and the evening remained muggy. Most shopkeepers slept outdoors.</p>

<h3>Taizhou</h3>
<p>Tax Police Clash with Citizens</p>
<p>At the market in Jing'ao Street, Wenling County, on the 30th of last month, merchants from various trades gathered. The tax police team stationed at Shiqiaotou went to patrol for smuggled goods. They seized two loads of smuggled salt in the market, and the two salt smugglers fled. The tax police were unable to catch them. A tofu vendor made a flippant remark, angering the tax police, who then beat him. Seeing this, the citizens felt indignant and surrounded the tax police, leading to a clash. The tax police fired their weapons in self-defense, and the crowd dispersed. Two tax police officers suffered head injuries and lost a firearm. Three citizens, Chen Kuanjie, Chen Maofang, and Chen Damei, were injured and arrested, and on the first, they petitioned the court to examine their injuries. It is said that the perpetrators have all escaped, and the three arrested are tofu vendors.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Tax Police Absconds with Funds</p>
<p>Jin Xiaonan, a tax policeman from the county government, took a two hundred yuan promissory note from the clerk Tang Yisheng to the clerk's office for redemption on June 30th, when the clerks were settling the accounts. However, the clerk was temporarily unable to prepare the funds and paid the policeman one hundred yuan first, requesting a three-day extension for the remaining one hundred yuan. Unexpectedly, the policeman Jin Xiaonan not only did not hand over the one hundred yuan to the county government but also absconded with his luggage and the unredeemed promissory notes from various firms around dawn on July 3rd. Upon learning of this, the tax police captain ordered the police to apprehend him, but there was no news. It is reported that the county government has detained the policeman's guarantor, Mr. Ji, and ordered him to bring Jin back to justice within a limited time for punishment.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Cotton Fields in Shazhou Suffer Damage</p>
<p>Shazhou Township in the seventh district of this county is renowned for its cotton production. However, cotton thrives in dry conditions and does not tolerate moisture. Shazhou is a newly formed landmass resulting from silt deposition from the Yangtze River over the past decade or so, and the soil is mostly gravelly. This year, however, there has been frequent rainfall since the beginning of summer, causing waterlogging in the cotton fields in the Nanfeng area of the district. Coupled with the high tide in the Yangtze River, the water level in the river has increased, making drainage impossible. The cotton seedlings, which had just sprouted, have been devastated. The harvest this autumn is bound to be reduced. Currently, the farmers in the district are using water pumps to drain the fields.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Takes Office on a Set Date</p>
<p>After Wang Xianqiang, the magistrate of Jiaxing County, submitted his resignation, Weng Cheng was appointed by the provincial government to fill the vacancy. He is scheduled to arrive in He on the 10th and take office on the same day. Various agricultural, commercial, and educational groups here have telegraphed their welcome. The key personnel of various departments have been largely decided.</p>

<h3>Various Factors in Shanghai's Municipal Development Over the Past Decade</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qun</p>
<p>Since the Treaty of Nanking was signed in 1842, Shanghai was opened as a treaty port in the following year as stipulated. As a result, this remote county on the coast leapt to become the center of foreign trade in the country. Later, during the Taiping Rebellion, Li Hongzhang used Shanghai as a base to quell the rebellion in all of Wu. Commentators believe that Shanghai's opening as a port provided the advantage of maritime transportation and the accumulation of wealth, making it easier to raise funds and procure equipment. Li's success was indeed due to this. Since then, Shanghai has often influenced the overall situation from its corner. In the 1910 Revolution, after Hanyang fell and Nanjing had not yet been recovered, the Wuchang Uprising, which started everything, was in a precarious position. In the end, Shanghai declared independence, shifting the nation's attention and laying the foundation for the Republic of China. The National Revolution of 1927 also resulted in the establishment of Nanjing as the capital and the unification of the country after Shanghai was stabilized. Moreover, due to the mix of Chinese and foreigners and earlier contact with Western civilization, in terms of culture and education, it often took the lead and became a model for the country. Shanghai's position, whether in economics, politics, military affairs, or even culture and education, is crucial to the overall situation. However, for decades, the political system's construction has failed to keep pace. During the late Qing Dynasty, only the Suzhou-Songjiang-Taicang Military Commissioner was stationed here. During the 1910 Revolution, Mr. Chen Qimei established a government here, calling himself the Shanghai Military Governor. However, in the initial stages, although the title was grand, the scale was insufficient, and it was soon abolished. After 1912, a garrison commander was established, along with a separate naval headquarters, responsible for land and sea security. For external negotiations, a special commissioner for Jiangsu negotiations was stationed here. As for municipal facilities, only the Engineering Bureau was under the jurisdiction of the garrison headquarters. It was not until 1926 that a municipal superintendent was established. Although the powers and responsibilities were more prominent and the scale was larger, Shanghai remained just one administrative district of Jiangsu Province. It was not until the establishment of the National Government in 1927 that the Shanghai Municipal Government was established, placing it in the administrative system as a local government directly under the Central Government, on par with the provincial government. Over the past ten years, despite many adversities, various construction projects have progressed smoothly. Details can be found in the administrative statistics and reports of previous years, and a quick review reveals remarkable achievements. Upon examination, there are four reasons: Tracing back to the early days of the Municipal Government's establishment, Mr. Huang Yingbai, as a pioneer of the revolution, was the first to be elected as mayor, creating systems and laws with long-term vision. He was succeeded by Mr. Zhang Boxuan, who implemented practical policies with sincerity, benefiting the people, who still remember him today. As for myself, with my limited abilities, I participated in this period, but I am ashamed to say that I made no significant contributions. Although the Greater Shanghai Plan was finalized and implemented during this time, the idea came before, and the implementation came after. I merely initiated it. Other municipal administration was also just advanced as needed to avoid falling behind. Later, Mr. Wu Tiecheng succeeded me as mayor of Shanghai, just as the January 28 Incident occurred. The aforementioned plan was inevitably greatly affected, but it was still able to proceed step by step. Although the complete picture is still pending, the framework is already complete. Indeed, Shanghai's position is important. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has been like the Fengyi and Fufeng regions, guarding the capital. Every mayor has been diligent and conscientious, striving to live up to the Central Government's trust. The progress of Shanghai's municipal administration is truly an important factor and a matter of fact, and I cannot omit it for fear of appearing biased. Secondly, Shanghai is a gathering place for people from all over the world. Citizens are exposed to modern knowledge and have more opportunities to receive it than people in the interior, thus raising the general cultural level. Moreover, with frequent contact with foreigners, a sense of national strength and weakness inevitably arises, leading to a particularly developed concept of the nation. Since the late Qing Dynasty, Shanghai citizens who sympathized with our party and worked hard for the revolution have been in the vast majority, deeply feeling the importance of national freedom and equality and believing that only revolution could achieve it. Even after the failure of the Second Revolution in 1912, Shanghai citizens showed our party the deepest sympathy. Since the establishment of the Municipal Government, they have made every effort to cooperate and support municipal construction. In my experience, the progress of Shanghai's municipal administration owes a great deal to the cooperation of its citizens. In the future, promoting municipal administration must continue to rely on this kind of cooperation as an important factor, without a doubt. Next, the Municipal Government receives instructions from the Central Government and the support of the citizens, and at the same time, it has the support of the local party headquarters and military organizations. Over the past ten years, it has faced numerous challenges, but the party, government, and military have always been closely integrated, working together through difficulties. Even with the devastation of the January 28 Incident, local order did not collapse, and construction plans did not stop. In just a few years, a brand-new city center area has been built on the ruins and trenches. This is the result of the concerted efforts of the party, government, and military. Next, the colleagues of the Municipal Government, from the heads of various bureaus downwards, mostly have specialized knowledge and are rich in administrative experience. They all regard Shanghai's municipal administration as a career, sharing weal and woe. They have swept away the bureaucratic habits of the past, and despite having higher positions and better treatment, they are unwilling to leave. As a result, the current and former mayors, such as Yu Hongjun, have all held their positions for a long time, enabling them to make the best use of their talents and abilities. Administrative efficiency has also been improved. Although the mayors have changed several times, the core personnel are sound, providing a central force for promoting municipal administration. In my opinion, the cadre-ization of the organization and the scientification of administration are the characteristics of the Shanghai Municipal Government. As for the harmonious cooperation of colleagues, that is just a bonus. This year, July 7th, marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government. A special publication is being compiled, and I have been asked to contribute an article. Therefore, I am recounting the various factors in Shanghai's municipal development over the past decade to commemorate the difficulties of creation and the ease with which the masses are alerted. Ten years have passed, and a hundred years can be expected. By relying on the prosperity of the city to elevate the country to strength, I cannot help but long for it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Retrospect and Prospect</h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>1.  Shanghai and My Relationship</p>
<p>The city of Shanghai has a particularly deep and special relationship with me personally. Although I have already left Shanghai, I still feel a very close and profound connection with it, along with boundless concern. This is because I have served in the Shanghai Municipal Government for more than five years, which can be said to be the longest period I have worked for the Party and the country in one place and with comrades in one area. In my personal life history, Shanghai occupies a very important position, and my administration in Shanghai happened to coincide with a major catastrophe since the establishment of the city of Shanghai. The outbreak of the January 28th Incident gave Shanghai a great blow and damage. During the wartime, maintaining order and pacifying the area, comforting and rescuing victims; and after the war, recuperating and rebuilding, reviving and renewing the city, it can truly be said that I exhausted my efforts and endured great hardships. Therefore, Shanghai leaves an especially deep impression on me.</p>
<p>This time, the Shanghai Municipal Government is holding a grand celebration for the tenth anniversary, which makes me, who has such a close relationship with Shanghai, feel particularly happy and gratified. My joyous and encouraging emotions are beyond words.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes, "The deeper the love, the more eager the hope." This sentence perfectly expresses my feelings towards Shanghai. Because I love Shanghai so deeply, my expectations for Shanghai are perhaps even more ardent than those of ordinary people. Now, taking this opportunity, in addition to specially noting my sincere congratulations, I would also like to briefly state my wishes for Shanghai as a gift from me to Shanghai.</p>
<p>2.  The Importance of Shanghai</p>
<p>If we compare the city of Shanghai with a province, although its area is relatively small and its population is also relatively small, its position is quite important. And its importance has been increasing day by day since the January 28th Incident, along with the intensification of international struggles. The reason why Shanghai's position is more important than any other part of China lies in the fact that Shanghai is the gateway to all of China. The safety of Shanghai is the safety of the entire country, and every move of Shanghai can have a very significant impact on the entire nation and the entire country.</p>
<p>Recalling the past, I came to Shanghai to preside over municipal administration, and soon the Shanghai War broke out. The Shanghai War was something that people both Chinese and foreign in all of Shanghai never imagined. Shanghai has very complex international relations, which are intricate and check and balance each other. Therefore, not only did the citizens of Shanghai never imagine that Shanghai would have this great war, but also people in any place outside Shanghai could not have expected that Shanghai, which has these international relations, would suddenly have a war. After the war, the place suffered extreme damage. It has been more than five years until this year. For these more than five years, through the consistent efforts of all my colleagues in the Municipal Government and all the citizens of Shanghai, not only has the damage in the war zone gradually been restored to its former appearance, but we have also built the city center area. We were able to establish these achievements and receive these results in the most difficult and arduous period in Shanghai's history. It can be said that it was beyond everyone's expectations. Because of this point, it is clear that as long as we do it, as long as we work hard, without asking how difficult the process is, without asking what the future harvest will be, we will be able to work hard as much as possible and do as much as possible, and there will inevitably be many results in the future.</p>
<p>In the difficult and arduous period of the past five or six years, why were we all not only able to overcome the continuous difficulties, one by one, time after time; but also, in the social aspect, in the cultural aspect, and in the economic aspect, still have a little bit of achievement? This is all due to the guidance of our central government, the support of all sectors of society, and the efforts of all the citizens. However, while we are still able to feel relieved, we must still intensify our efforts. In the passive aspect, we should enable the little foundation that has been formed by the hard work of the 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai over the past five or six years to be maintained; in the active aspect, many unfinished construction projects should continue to be built continuously. And Shanghai is a gateway to our capital, so how can Shanghai be worthy of being the gateway to our capital? I am afraid that in this environment, the future work will be even more difficult than the past.</p>
<p>3.  My Wishes for Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the issues that should be paid attention to in future municipal administration, now I would like to provide several points based on my feelings:</p>
<p>A. Public Security Issue</p>
<p>The first is the public security issue. Shanghai's public security is very important, and public security issues can often affect the overall situation. I hope that the responsible comrades of the Shanghai military and police will still pay close attention to the public security issue in Shanghai in the future based on the experience of the past few years. At the same time, it is even more necessary for all parties to cooperate sincerely and jointly protect peace and tranquility. The reason why Shanghai's public security has not had problems in the past can be explained from three relationships:</p>
<p>1.  The Sincere Cooperation of the Party, Government, and Military</p>
<p>In the past five or six years, the Party, government, and military in Shanghai have not only had no estrangement, but also have had consistent opinions and sincere cooperation. No matter what the matter is, everyone has been completely cooperating. Therefore, no matter whether they are people within the Party or people within the government, the impression of our Party-government relationship has been very good. We cannot deny that in the past, in many places, especially in the interior, the opinions of the Party, government, and military were inconsistent and they could not cooperate, so many opinions arose, which was very unfortunate. However, in Shanghai in the past few years, everyone has been cooperating sincerely, everyone has been consistent, and everyone has been cooperating. No matter what the matter is, we have opened Party-government-military talks to jointly discuss the progress. Although the resolutions of the Party-government-military talks do not have legal effect, once we have resolved it, everyone follows it and does it. This kind of relationship of sincere cooperation between the Party, government, and military is very valuable, and I hope that it will continue to be maintained in the future.</p>
<p>2.  The Cooperation Between the Government and Local Organizations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has also cooperated very well with local organizations in the past. Everything has been discussed with everyone openly and honestly. Because every move of Shanghai is enough to affect the overall situation, the government and local organizations should be united and cooperate sincerely. The reason why Shanghai has been peaceful and uneventful over the years is not unrelated to this. I hope that this spirit will also be maintained in the future.</p>
<p>3.  The Maintenance of Friendly Relations with Foreigners in the Concessions</p>
<p>Shanghai has two concessions. There are forty or fifty countries of foreigners residing in Shanghai. The rights of these forty or fifty countries of foreigners often conflict with each other and cannot be reconciled. We must find ways to maintain friendly relations with the international community. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Government should regard itself as the main body in Shanghai, and treat the foreigners residing in this city as residents. We should stand in the position of the owner and take on the responsibility of protection. Before the two concessions are recovered, we cannot ignore the facts. Unnecessary disputes should be avoided as much as possible, and we must maintain friendly and cooperative relations. There are many places where the concession needs the help of the municipal government. The municipal government also has many places where it needs to cooperate with the concession under this special circumstance. Therefore, the friendly relationship between the municipal government and the two concessions must still be maintained in the future.</p>
<p>B. Material Construction</p>
<p>Next, when it comes to municipal construction, since the Shanghai War, the spiritual construction and material construction that all the colleagues of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the citizens of Shanghai have worked together for five or six years, although many have been completed, there are still many that need to continue to be worked on, and there are still many that have not been done due to funding and the situation. These works are all needed by our Shanghai. I hope that when the finances are abundant in the future, we will be able to do them one by one. Now, as far as I can remember, I will provide the "various items separately as follows:</p>
<p>1.  General Construction of the City Center Area</p>
<p>This point is most important for the construction of Greater Shanghai. We must continue to work hard step by step within the possible scope of the overall situation and finances. In particular, the development of the Qiujiang Wharf and the city center area is most related, so we should urge its early completion. Because the investment of the municipal government and the people in the city center area has reached as much as 40 or 50 million yuan, we must not only continue to maintain it, but also continue to build it to seek prosperity and development.</p>
<p>2.  City Museum and City Library</p>
<p>Although the City Museum and the Library have now been established, the content has not yet been enriched, and it must be actively improved in the future.</p>
<p>3.  Civil Welfare Undertakings</p>
<p>In the past, we all had a great ambition to improve the lives of the people of Shanghai and increase the welfare of the people. Therefore, even when the administration was extremely difficult, we still allocated a sum of money to build new civilian villages to replace the shacks. However, now only four civilian villages have been built, which can only solve one-tenth of the city's shacks. There are still many that are not enough. In the future, how should we continue to promote the construction of civilian villages to improve the lives of the people and increase the welfare of the people? It remains to be seen that we must continue to intensify our efforts.</p>
<p>4.  Other Social Undertakings</p>
<p>Over the years, the Shanghai Municipal Government has founded many cultural and social undertakings, such as establishing schools and establishing hospitals. Social and cultural undertakings are extremely important. We must complete what has not been completed. For example, Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Memorial Hospital, Mr. Wang Yiting's Memorial Pavilion in the Longhua Scenic Area, etc., we should try to complete them within the possible scope, and we will continue to promote this kind of undertaking in the future.</p>
<p>Because our time and financial resources are limited, we cannot take care of everything at the same time. In the past few years, because we wanted to revive the war zone and build the city center area, we did not have extra time and financial resources to do other aspects of the undertaking, so there are still many jobs that should be done but have not been done. Of course, I hope that we can take care of everything at the same time in the future and lift up all the abandoned.</p>
<p>C. Spiritual Construction</p>
<p>The above is mostly about material construction. Regarding the spiritual aspect, there are still a few points:</p>
<p>1.  Literacy Education</p>
<p>There are almost more than 400,000 illiterate people in the urban area of Shanghai. We have been running literacy education for two years, and we have only taught more than three-sevenths of the total number of people. There are still about 200,000 people waiting for us to teach them. Therefore, we still need to continue to work hard on the literacy education movement in this city in order to complete it. The concession authorities have never paid attention to the cultural and educational undertakings of the Chinese people in the concession, but we cannot but pay attention to the cultural and educational undertakings within the concession. Therefore, literacy education must still be promoted to the concession in order to improve the intellectual level of the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>2.  Regarding the Centralized Training of Students</p>
<p>In the past two years, the centralized training of students in this city was held in Suzhou, which cost a lot of money and felt a lot of inconvenience. Therefore, this year, a barracks was built in Shanghai. In addition to the centralized training of students, this barracks can also be used for scout training, police training, training for all the city's principals and teachers, security team training, and civic training. The centralized training of students and civic training are very important. We must invigorate the spirit of the citizens, improve the knowledge of the citizens, rectify the discipline of the citizens, strengthen the physique of the citizens, and instill ordinary military knowledge to the citizens. We must rely on the centralized training of students and civic training, so the centralized training of students and civic training must still be paid attention to in the future. Do not abandon food because of choking due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>D. Economic Construction</p>
<p>1.  Regarding Agricultural Production</p>
<p>In the future, we must find ways to improve the production technology of the farmers in the four suburbs of Shanghai, increase the production of farmers, improve the livelihood of farmers, in order to supply the needs of this city. Shanghai is a large metropolis with more than a million people. The rice, wheat, cotton, vegetables, melons, beans, eggs, and even flowers consumed every day are quite a lot. These must all be supplied by the farmers of this city. I originally had a plan, but because of financial and time constraints, it has not been implemented to this day. This plan is to spend money to rent 1,000 mu of land in the urban area, such as Jiangwan or Wusong, to grow grain. Set a ten-year plan or a five-year plan, use the latest production methods, and hire local farmers to plant. This is both a production undertaking and also implies education. Use the improved new production methods to increase the knowledge of farmers. At the same time, it can also solve a part of the unemployment problem. For example, a garden can be set up in Pudong, and a vegetable garden can be set up in Zhenru. We can do these things in this way. These are all things that are related to production, related to education, and related to society. In the past, because of financial and time constraints, we have not yet started to look forward to it. It can be specifically realized in the future.</p>
<p>2.  Regarding the Financial Aspect</p>
<p>Although the financial situation has been extremely difficult in the past few years, the money spent is indeed more than in previous years. Therefore, the financial aspect must always require a fundamental solution after the collection. Finance must always have a condition. Although it cannot be spent according to income, it should not differ too much. In the future, how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, how to reorganize, is also an important issue.</p>
<p>3.  Regarding the Land Administration</p>
<p>First, we must complete the land survey, and secondly, the land administration procedures must also be improved to simplify it. Land administration is probably not easy to improve at once due to the deeply ingrained habits, but it must always be paid attention to and work hard in this direction.</p>
<p>Because I have a very deep feeling for the city of Shanghai, I cannot help but have particularly eager concern and hope for the city of Shanghai. The above points are all the "farewell remarks" that I gave to my colleagues when I left Shanghai this spring. Now, taking advantage of the grand celebration of the tenth anniversary of Shanghai, I would like to present my feelings at that time, based on my memory, as a congratulatory gift, and sincerely pray for the bright future and development of Shanghai.

<h3>Municipal Progress in Shanghai Over the Past Ten Years</h3>
<p>— Yu Hongjun</p>
<p>Those who discussed governance in the past emphasized practical action, while those who speak of administration today prioritize efficiency. Though their methods of identifying causes and exploring results may differ, their ultimate goals are the same. Shanghai has implemented the municipal system for ten years, under the tenure of four mayors. Its initiatives have consistently drawn attention from both Chinese and foreign observers. While opinions and judgments may vary, a careful examination reveals that the achievements of these ten years are not accidental. They are the result of close coordination between the central and local governments, consistent policies in all matters, and dedicated efforts from officials at all levels, enabling steady progress to this day. As a member of the municipal government for a decade, I commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Municipal Government's establishment by summarizing key historical points for the reference of all sectors.</p>
<p>The city of Shanghai was established on July 7, 1927. At that time, the National Revolutionary Army had just unified the north and south. Given Shanghai's importance, it was designated a special municipality directly under the National Government. The first mayor, Mr. Huang Yingbai, a veteran of key positions, was specially appointed. During his brief two-month tenure, he formulated the organizational regulations for the Shanghai Municipal Government and essential single-item rules. He established bureaus for various administrative functions, selected talented individuals for appointments, and reorganized existing local authorities in Shanghai, such as the Hubai Engineering and Patrol Donation Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Office, and the Shanghai County Land Survey Bureau, assigning them to new bureaus. He also petitioned the National Government to delineate the municipal area. Although his tenure was brief, his pioneering work laid the foundation for Shanghai's future development. His successor, Mr. Zhang Boxuan, continued to build upon the established framework and principles, working diligently to expand the city's boundaries. He quickly resolved the issue of the municipal area's scope. He incorporated the townships and villages of Shangbao County, uniformly renaming them districts, thereby expanding the city's jurisdiction severalfold. The foundation of Greater Shanghai was firmly established during this period. When Mr. Zhang Yuejun succeeded him in April 1929, he continued to focus on practical municipal improvements, promoting benefits and eliminating abuses in all aspects. Priorities were set according to their urgency. After the old city area was largely organized, he proceeded to plan the new city area, aiming to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's vision of Greater Shanghai. On July 7, 1931, the cornerstone laying ceremony for the new municipal building in the city center was held. The grand scale of today's city center originated from this time. The five years from the establishment of the city to the end of 1931 can be regarded as the formative period of Shanghai.</p>
<p>In January 1932, Mr. Wu Tiecheng assumed the mayorship. Within weeks, he faced the tragic January 28 Incident. In the midst of adversity, he remained calm and focused on relief efforts, providing assistance to refugees and saving countless lives. Post-disaster reconstruction was a key priority, and bonds were issued to fund these efforts. Concerned about the weakness of local police forces, he established the Security Bureau in August of the same year to strengthen defense. At the same time, he continued to promote the construction of the city center. At the end of 1933, the new municipal building was completed, and the government moved in the following spring. He then focused on promoting the prosperity of the new city area and social development. Over the next year, important buildings such as the stadium, museum, library, and municipal hospital were successively completed. The National Games of 1935 were held in the newly built stadium, attracting a large crowd and marking a grand occasion. He also initiated a compulsory literacy campaign, eliminating half of the city's illiteracy within a year. New villages were built for the common people, providing clean and comfortable housing. Other initiatives included group weddings to promote thrift and the New Life Movement to reform society. These achievements are well-known and need not be repeated here. During these five years, he devoted himself to public health, welfare, and education, giving comprehensive consideration to all aspects. However, limited by the city's financial resources, many tasks remain unfinished. This stage can be regarded as the construction period of Shanghai.</p>
<p>In March of this year, Mr. Tiecheng was ordered to serve as chairman of Guangdong Province. I, Hongjun, have temporarily assumed his duties, aware of my limited abilities. I can only follow the guidance of the central government, adhere to the established policies of my predecessors, and seek the supervision and assistance of the city's residents. I will carefully study and implement urgent tasks such as national economic construction and local self-government within a short period of time, hoping to maintain the consistent spirit of Shanghai's administration. This would be most fortunate.</p>
<h3>Social Administration in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>Article 14, Paragraph 1 of the Municipal Organization Law promulgated by the National Government in May 1930 stipulates that the Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for the items listed in Article 8, Paragraphs 1 to 10 of the Law. These ten items, summarized, constitute social administration, and are listed as follows: (1) Household registration and personnel registration matters; (2) Facilities for childcare, elderly care, poverty alleviation, and disaster relief; (3) Grain storage and regulation matters; (4) Improvement and protection of agriculture, industry, and commerce; (5) Labor administration matters; (6) Protection and regulation of afforestation, land reclamation, animal husbandry, hunting, and fishing; (7) Supervision of privately operated public utilities; (8) Organization and guidance of cooperatives and mutual aid enterprises; (9) Improvement of customs and morals; (10) Education and other cultural matters.</p>
<p>Because the city has a Bureau of Public Utilities, the aforementioned item 7 regarding the supervision of privately operated public utilities is under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Public Utilities. To facilitate handling matters, item 1 regarding household registration and personnel registration was also transferred to the former Public Security Bureau, now the Police Bureau. As for item 10 regarding education and other cultural matters, after the merger and reorganization of the city's Education Bureau and Social Affairs Bureau in October 1936, it remains one of the responsibilities of the Social Affairs Bureau. Therefore, social administration in Shanghai today mainly refers to the eight items mentioned above, excluding items 1, 7, and 10.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the mayor, we serve the Shanghai Municipal Government and are responsible for the city's social administration. As mentioned above, the scope of social administration is extremely broad, covering many aspects, much like the all-encompassing meaning of the word "society" in the general public's imagination. China is advancing on the path of building a modern nation, and the trend of administrative specialization is becoming increasingly evident, with increasingly complex laws and regulations. Over the past ten years, we have implemented national policies and handled local affairs. Even a brief account of our measures would require volumes, which is beyond the scope of this article. Now, I would like to present a brief overview of the major aspects of social administration in the city, categorized into four types.</p>
<p>First, agricultural, industrial, and commercial administration matters. Shanghai is the most populous and commercially prosperous city in the country, but it still has 500,000 mu of cultivated land, with over 54,000 farming households, totaling about 300,000 people, relying on agriculture for their livelihood. Therefore, the improvement and protection of agriculture, industry, and commerce in the city cannot be neglected. Regarding agriculture, the primary focus is on improving crops and increasing yields. The Social Affairs Bureau has established an agricultural and forestry farm in Pudong, with experimental areas for rice, wheat, and soybeans, distributing improved seeds, guiding farmers with technology, and preventing insect pests and rice borers. The farm also cultivates a large number of seedlings, flowers, and grasses, and distributes them to citizens during the annual afforestation campaign to encourage planting, aiming to regulate the climate, improve public health, and promote the urbanization of rural areas. To promote farmers' sideline occupations, the Social Affairs Bureau has organized chicken-raising cooperatives, starting with the Gaoqiao and Luxing districts, with good results. In addition, strictly enforcing fishing vessel registration, preventing foreign vessels from encroaching on fishing grounds, studying aquatic product economics, and guiding the improvement of fishing grounds are all important agricultural policies. Regarding industry, the promotion of the new system of weights and measures was announced on July 1, 1931, unifying weights and measures in the city. Over the past six years, approximately 1.5 million measuring instruments have been inspected, and over 2,000 old instruments have been inspected and destroyed each year, not including those transferred to the courts for legal action. Unfortunately, due to obstruction by the Municipal Council in the First Special District, inspections have not yet been implemented. Other relatively important matters include the testing, research, certification, and encouragement of industrial products, as well as the establishment of industrial product standards and the registration of factories. Regarding commerce, important matters include company registration, business registration, group registration, review of practitioners, mediation of disputes, suppression of monopolies, prevention of speculation, and the compilation of commercial, financial, and price statistics.</p>
<p>Second, labor administration matters. Since the promulgation of the Factory Law, the city has been preparing to implement factory inspections. However, negotiations regarding factory inspections in the concessions have been delayed for a long time and have not yet been resolved, resulting in the inability to effectively implement city-wide inspections, leading to frequent factory disasters, endangering the lives of workers, and causing significant losses to industrial capital, which is truly regrettable! Labor issues are a major and important part of modern social problems. To solve them, it is necessary to study the facts first. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau has devoted considerable effort to compiling statistics on labor in the city and has achieved rich results. Over the past ten years, the following have been compiled and published regularly: (1) Statistics on wages and working hours, including "Trial Compilation of Wage Index," "Wages and Working Hours," and "Wage Rates in Shanghai," and "Statistics on Actual Income of Workers" and "Survey of Wage Systems in the City" are being compiled. (2) Survey of Workers' Living Standards: "Living Standards of Shanghai Workers" has been published, providing detailed analysis of workers' family population, age, gender, occupation, distribution of income sources and amounts, and the average household expenditure on food, clothing, housing, etc. (3) Cost of Living Index for Workers: Compiled and published in book form from 1926 to 1931, and continued to be compiled monthly since 1932, published in newspapers as a basis for resolving wage issues. (4) Statistics on Strikes and Lockouts: "Strikes and Lockouts in Shanghai in the Past Fifteen Years" has been published, and statistics continue to be compiled and published monthly. (5) Statistics on Labor Disputes: Published in special books from 1928 to 1932, and statistics continue to be compiled and published monthly. In addition, the mediation of labor disputes, the review of factory regulations, and the registration of labor unions are all handled in accordance with central government laws and regulations or the city's own regulations.</p>
<p>Third, social welfare administration matters. This category includes childcare, elderly care, poverty alleviation, disaster relief facilities, grain storage and regulation, the organization and guidance of cooperatives and mutual aid enterprises, and the improvement of customs and morals. The scope is broad, and a lot of funds are needed. The city is limited by its financial resources and has not been able to carry out all of them one by one. For example, childcare, elderly care, poverty alleviation, and disaster relief can only be done by supervising, improving, and assisting existing private facilities. Regarding grain regulation, although the Social Affairs Bureau has worked hard to open up sources, prevent waste, encourage hoarding, crack down on speculation, and conduct investigations and statistics, these are ultimately stopgap measures because it lacks the ability to carry out storage. Every time there is a grain shortage, it is difficult to cope. Only the consumer and sales cooperatives have made some progress in the cooperative business, and the number is gradually developing. However, although there are plans for rural credit cooperation, it has not been carried out due to financial limitations. Regarding the improvement of customs, the promotion of the New Life Movement and the holding of group weddings have been quite effective in saving the city's decadent customs.</p>
<p>Fourth, education administration matters. The city's education has progressed every year since the establishment of the municipal government. Detailed information is included in the municipal government reports and education statistics books, which cannot be listed here. Currently, there are municipal secondary schools, 201 elementary schools, kindergartens, and other affiliated institutions, such as the Public Education Center, the Circulation Library, the Zoo, and the Public Simple Sports Grounds, and various tutorial schools, which promote social education and are very effective. The Social Affairs Bureau has made special efforts to promote short-term elementary schools, compulsory elementary schools, and literacy education in order to eliminate illiteracy in the city. At the same time, it advocates vocational education to meet social needs. In addition, strict limitations on teachers, certification of teachers, training of private school teachers, rectification of private schools, narrowing down substandard private schools, and focusing on teacher training are all ongoing.</p>
<p>All of the above are important social administration matters in the city. Among them, due to the existence of the concessions, inconsistent governance, and frequent obstructions, it is sometimes not possible to carry out the various matters related to agriculture, industry, commerce, labor, education, and culture smoothly. However, we have been carrying out national policies and working hard for ten years to avoid making mistakes. As for local welfare matters, it is a pity that due to limited financial resources, there have been few achievements and little benefit. This is what I feel most uneasy about after the review.</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Tenth Anniversary of the Establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government</h3>
<p>— Zhang Dingfan</p>
<p>Looking back to the autumn of 1927, I was honored to be appointed to lead the city of Shanghai. At that time, the military situation had just stabilized, and there was no time for construction. I tried my best, and nearly two years have passed. I am deeply ashamed that I have not achieved anything. Time flies like an arrow, and ten years have passed in a flash.</p>
<p>This year, July 7th, marks the tenth anniversary of the Municipal Government. A gathering was held and a special publication was compiled to commemorate the occasion. Examining the past and expanding the future is of great significance. Not considering me as ignorant and foolish, you requested an article from me. Shanghai is an internationally renowned commercial port and the economic and cultural center of the country. Its importance, the complexity of its administration, the uniqueness of its environment, and the difficulty of its measures are well-known to the people of the country. In the past ten years, thanks to the continuous efforts of the colleagues in the Municipal Government and the multi-faceted assistance of all citizens, all aspects of construction have made significant progress. This is reflected in the charts and figures in the statistics, which can be easily reviewed.</p>
<p>Recalling this day ten years ago, Shanghai was just beginning its reform, just a newborn baby that had just fallen to the ground. After years of nurturing, it has now reached childhood. To reach the prime of life with a healthy body, it is not far away. Following the progress of the wheels of the times, it seeks to fulfill its historical mission. This depends on the Municipal Government catching up quickly and relying on the deep cooperation of the citizens, working together with one heart and one mind, and supporting each other, in order to break through the encirclement of difficulties and enter the door of victory.</p>
<p>However, municipal construction is a large-scale undertaking with many details. At a time when national fortune is declining and people's livelihood is withering, it is difficult to achieve all success with one effort. It is difficult to assume the responsibility with meager strength, and it is impossible to do so. The key is to weigh the importance and urgency, identify the needs of the times and the welfare of the citizens as the main body, and determine the order. Material construction should be implemented step by step, and spiritual construction is particularly urgent. The New Life Movement is the axis of our spiritual mobilization and should be actively promoted to the entire citizenry, so that they can establish firm beliefs and generate great power. If this is the case, material and spiritual aspects will complement each other, and the people and the government will become increasingly integrated. The speed of municipal progress will compete with the passage of time, and the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Great Shanghai Plan will be guaranteed in the twentieth anniversary celebration. The inscription on the basin of King Tang of Shang says, "If you can make it new one day, renew it day by day, and again renew it." I cannot help but feel overjoyed!</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Finances</h3>
<p>— Xu Fu</p>
<p>Shanghai is a major commercial port in East Asia and the financial center of the country. Its position is important and its environment is unique. Municipal construction is particularly important to both Chinese and foreign observers. However, to promote construction, it is necessary to strengthen financial resources first. Since the establishment of the Municipal Government, in order to complete the construction, special attention has been paid to the promotion of finance. In the past ten years, the municipal treasury's annual revenue and expenditure have increased from more than 3 million yuan to more than 10 million yuan. The gradual realization of construction plans has been pioneered by finance. The following briefly describes the financial evolution of the city for those who care about municipal affairs:</p>
<p>The evolution of the city's finances can be roughly divided into three periods: (1) the period of receiving and reorganizing, (2) the period of gradual advancement, and (3) the period of the impact of the incident and post-disaster revitalization. Before the establishment of the Municipal Government, the city's local finances were managed by the former Shanghai Municipal Office, Zhabei was managed by the former Hubai Engineering and Patrol Donation Bureau, and Pudong was managed by the former Tanggong Relief Bureau and Yangjing Municipal Office. The financial power was not unified, and the measures were extremely diverse. After the establishment of the Municipal Government, the Finance Bureau successively took over the finances of the former municipal agencies, merged and reorganized them, and the Municipal Government established a Financial Reorganization Committee to jointly promote progress. Various taxes and donations were gradually unified, and the burden on citizens was averaged. As a result of the reorganization, the annual revenue and expenditure in 1927 were more than 3 million yuan, and in 1927, they increased to more than 4 million yuan. The initial foundation of finance was laid at this time. This was the period of receiving and reorganizing. Later, various donations and taxes, such as house tax, vehicle tax, and ship tax, were able to gradually increase and collect more widely. In 1929, a municipal bond of 3 million yuan was issued, which was used for the construction of municipal main roads and the construction of the city center area. In addition, funds were allocated to establish the Shanghai Municipal Bank, in order to regulate finance and facilitate society, and the old road administration bridge road and Yimiao Yutuan and other public bonds were reorganized and completed, and the finances became more organized. In 1929, the annual revenue, excluding public bonds, reached more than 6.25 million yuan, and the annual expenditure was more than 6.19 million yuan. In 1930, the annual revenue was more than 7.2 million yuan, and the annual expenditure, including payments under public bonds, reached more than 9.5 million yuan, all showing a trend of advancement. This was the period of gradual advancement. Then came the January 28 Incident, and the rising finances were greatly affected. Although various taxes and revenues were gradually restored after the incident was quelled, on the expenditure side, post-disaster relief, restoring and building the city, and continuing to complete the construction of the city center area all required large sums of money. Therefore, in 1932, a disaster area reconstruction bond of 6 million yuan was issued, and in 1934, a municipal bond of 3.5 million yuan was issued. In the autumn of 1933, a temporary land value tax was launched, and in the winter of 1934, the house tax and vehicle tax rates were increased to meet the needs. In recent years, various construction projects in the city have gradually progressed. In terms of public security, security teams have been added, and attention has been paid to the promotion of sanitation and education. The financial burden has become heavier. From 1931 to 1935, the municipal treasury's annual revenue increased from more than 7.5 million yuan to more than 10.3 million yuan, and the annual expenditure increased from 9.5 million yuan to more than 12.8 million yuan. As of the end of April 1936, the municipal treasury's revenue reached more than 9.9 million yuan, and the expenditure also reached more than 9.6 million yuan. It is expected that both revenue and expenditure will exceed the previous year's figures by the end of the year. From this, we can see that the city's revenue has been reorganized effectively, but the construction is vast and the financial resources are still insufficient, so we have to rely on fundraising and allocation to meet the urgent needs. This is the period of the impact of the incident and post-disaster revitalization.</p>
<p>The general situation of the evolution of finances over the years has been described above. As for the reforms in financial administration in recent years, the main ones are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Improving the inspection system and reorganizing tax collection. The most important thing is strictness, so the inspection system should be highly valued. The bureau originally had an inspection section, but the inspectors were stationed in various tax collection offices and were directly commanded by the directors of the offices, which could not fully perform the function of inspection. Therefore, in April 1936, the inspection powers of the entire bureau were concentrated in the bureau's inspection section, and all inspectors were distinguished, transferred to the bureau, and assigned to the inspection section for distribution and assignment. Since its implementation, it has been effective in cracking down on omissions and eliminating embezzlement.</p>
<p>(2) Improving the accounting system of affiliated institutions. The amount of taxes collected by the bureau's tax collection offices is very large. If the accounting personnel sent by the bureau are not responsible for registering and reporting the accounts, it will not be enough for auditing. Therefore, in August 1936, the regulations of the tax collection offices were revised, stipulating that the accounting affairs of each office should be handled by the accounting personnel selected and sent by the bureau; for the ship donation offices under the bureau, officers were also assigned to specialize in accounting affairs, in order to comply with the purpose of accounting independence and fulfill the function of auditing.</p>
<p>(3) Improving the house tax collection method. The city's house tax has always been collected by pre-filling out actual tickets. The pre-filling process is cumbersome, and post-audit is inconvenient; and the number of tickets returned and discarded each quarter is as high as more than 20,000, and the collectors may not be able to hide and report the situation. The loss to the municipal treasury is not small. In order to thoroughly improve and eliminate long-standing malpractices, after careful research, it was approved by the municipal government that the method of cutting-number blank receipts should be adopted from the autumn of 1936; a collection register should be created, and the collectors should collect donations according to the register, and the receipts should be cut and given to the donors temporarily. When the collectors submit the money, the tax collection offices immediately audit the tickets and money. Since its implementation, it has been easier to prevent problems such as the return of tickets and remittances, as well as the transfer of A to B, big head and small tail; it can also save the waste of discarded tickets; and the efficiency of collection has also been improved.</p>
<p>In short, the city's finances have been reorganized as much as possible in its own aspect. Considering the objective environment, it is different from other cities, and the promotion of finance may be hindered or need to be coordinated. In the future, we can only continue to move forward on the path of balancing revenue and expenditure, and make efforts to reduce expenditure and increase revenue, so as to concentrate financial resources on construction projects. The completion of the Great Shanghai Plan still depends on finance as the pioneer.</p>
<h3>Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau and Land Administration Bureau Xu Fu</h3>
<h3>Shanghai Municipality's Police Force</h3>
<p>— Cai Jinjun</p>
<p>The establishment of a police organization in Shanghai began with the General Patrol Bureau of the late Qing Dynasty. In its initial stages, it was merely a rudimentary structure, comprising only about 260 patrol leaders and police officers. Although it underwent repeated changes and gradual expansion thereafter, the system remained disorganized, and the division of authority was unclear. In terms of its nature, it was simultaneously government-run and gentry-managed, and in terms of its name, there were separate county police and commercial port police within the same area. Furthermore, police affairs offices were separately established in Nanshi and Zhabei. In January of the second year of the Republic (1913), the one in Nanshi was renamed the Shanghai Commercial Port Patrol Bureau, and the one in Zhabei was renamed the Zhabei Patrol Bureau. After four months, the two bureaus were merged into the Songhu Police Department, with internal divisions into sections and external establishment of six district offices and nineteen sub-stations. In addition, it directly controlled a security police team, four patrol police teams, and a water police detective team, totaling more than 3,000 people. The following year, it was renamed the Superintendent's Office of the Songhu Land and Water Police, and the northern and southern cities were reorganized, with separate branch offices established. However, after only half a year, the old system was restored.</p>
<p>During the National Revolution in the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), the army established its presence in Nanjing and Shanghai. In July of that year, the Shanghai Municipal Government was established, and the police force was reorganized into the Municipal Public Security Bureau. However, with order just beginning to be established, the police force was scattered, and only about 500 officers remained. At that time, the urban area expanded, the population increased sharply, and the security police force urgently needed to be strengthened. Consequently, the four patrol police teams were reorganized into security teams, and the police officers trained in the first phase of the training institute were formed into two teams, creating a total of six security teams. In addition, there was a water patrol team, a detective team, and a military band, and externally, 2,000 police district centers and sub-stations were established. By the end of the sixteenth year of the Republic, there were 3,799 official police officers, and by the end of the nineteenth year, the number had increased to 5,033. From December of the twentieth year, after receiving the Jiangsu Provincial Water Public Security Team, the authority of this Bureau's water patrol team was unified. However, after the January 28th Incident, the police force and equipment suffered great losses. Efforts were made to restore the force afterward, and by the end of the twenty-second year, the total number of official police officers was 5,438. By the end of the twenty-third year, the total number of official police officers had increased to 5,553. During this stage, although the scale was somewhat established, there were still many aspects of the police's poor quality and inadequate equipment that needed to be supplemented and corrected. This is the general situation of the past.</p>
<p>The mission of the Shanghai police, in its passive aspect, is to prevent problems before they occur and to ensure the safety of the lives and property of all citizens. In its active aspect, it is to complete the new metropolis and enhance the welfare of the lives of all citizens. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to rectify discipline and strictly enforce rewards and punishments. Moreover, one must be humble, persevering, courteous, honest, diligent, thrifty, prudent, enthusiastic, brave, unyielding to power, and unenticed by profit. One must painstakingly hone oneself amidst hardship and adversity to increase one's knowledge, experience, and abilities, and with passion and vigor, move forward bravely to serve as a model and example for all citizens. Furthermore, one must organize and train the populace to arm the populace, militarize the populace, and policize the populace so that they become one in mind and help each other in the same boat. Not only will the safety of Shanghai be guaranteed, but on a larger scale, the permanent cornerstone of national rejuvenation will be laid.</p>
<p>Having realized this, since taking office in the twenty-fourth year of the Republic (1935), I have strived to reform and actively build, such as establishing a smokers' registration section to implement the prohibition of opium and drugs, establishing a New Life Movement section to actively promote the New Life Movement, adding female police officers to maximize special investigative capabilities, setting up a gun examination team to adopt scientific inspection methods, and setting up a police vehicle fleet for effective prevention of crime. These are all new creations that did not exist in the old system. Furthermore, the Supervisory Office was expanded to give full play to its supervisory and security functions, the Detective Team was reorganized to fulfill its responsibilities for investigation and arrest, and the Police General Team was expanded to meet the needs of the times. These were all present in the old system but have been improved and enriched. Currently, the internal organization of the General Bureau is divided into four sections and one office. The First Section is dedicated to general affairs, divided into seven divisions: personnel, documents, compilation, statistics, accounting, general affairs, and armaments. The Second Section handles police administrative affairs, divided into eight divisions: public security, household registration, foreign affairs, commercial affairs, health care, relief, transportation, and fire protection. The Third Section handles judicial affairs, divided into four divisions: interrogation, detention, affairs, and fingerprints. The Smokers' Registration Section is dedicated to drug prohibition affairs, divided into four divisions: licensing, investigation, inspection, and affairs. The Supervisory Office is in charge of internal and external duties, special investigation, and all security affairs, divided into eight divisions: internal duty, external duty, police affairs, training, New Life Movement, special affairs, security, and investigation. As for the external organization, the entire city is divided into eight districts, with eight branch bureaus, twenty-two police stations, thirty-four substations, and a total of one hundred and eight land and water police posts. In addition, there are also the Police General Team, the Detective Team, the Water Patrol Team, the Police Training Institute, and the Detention Center, etc. In total, there are more than 800 internal and external staff members, more than 7,000 police officers, and more than 1,000 petitioning police officers.</p>
<p>Today's Shanghai has become the commercial throat of the country and the central hub of the national capital. Not only are merchants gathered here, but it has also become a political center. Chinese and foreigners intermingle, and the dense population is gradually becoming a source of cultural development and a general hub for the contact of national minds. According to my ideal of a new metropolis, its form should advance daily towards order, solemnity, grandeur, and the magnificent spectacle of progress, and its spirit should contain the beautiful qualities of love, benevolence, sincerity, and peace. Therefore, in the past two years, in addition to improving the organization, expanding the police force, and strengthening the police force itself, attention has also been paid to revising the uniforms of officials and police officers, reforming case-handling procedures, eliminating student and worker movements, and eradicating corruption and local bullies. These are the most prominent aspects. In addition, the four items of training officials and police officers, investigating household registration, prohibiting opium and drugs, and promoting the New Life Movement are marked as the central tasks. This is the current situation of the city's police force.</p>
<p>Regarding future facilities, there are still many matters that urgently need to be improved and promoted, such as increasing the number of police officers, raising salaries, adding new equipment, and constructing suitable bureau offices. All of these are matters that cannot be delayed, but it is necessary to broadly raise funds, recruit specialists, and devote all efforts to them. Only then can the city's police administration be expected to make progress in the new era. It is my sincere hope that colleagues in the municipal government and the virtuous leaders of all sectors will provide guidance and assistance, and work together to promote its success.</p>
<p>Shanghai's environment is unique. As long as the concessions exist, the police power cannot be fully exercised for even a single day. Moreover, consular jurisdiction has not yet been revoked, and it is particularly difficult to manage foreigners in the urban area. Therefore, no matter how big or small the matter, one must take great pains and handle it with caution. One must have a mind as clear and bright as a sunny day after rain and reason as if one is striking gold and jade. Regardless of the myriad of principles, one must be grounded in reality and not rely on a momentary feeling or an irrational impulse to cause trouble. All difficulties will naturally be resolved easily. It is hoped that our police personnel will pay special attention to ensuring that all police administration can be rationalized and modernized to increase the trust of foreigners, so that in the future, there will be corresponding assistance in the handling of concession issues and the abolition of unequal treaties.</p>
<p>Everything in the past has evolved into the present, and the present will change into the future. Cause and effect are intertwined, and fortune and misfortune are interdependent, forming such a complex process. Any success is not a cause for joy but can be seen as a failure. Any failure should not be despaired of but should be strived to make it a success. As long as everyone can prepare their own strength through self-awareness and self-improvement and engage in large-scale unity to break through the current difficulties with great combined strength. It should be known that national rejuvenation is not only the enrichment of military preparations but also the common progress of efforts in all aspects of society. The contribution of the people to the country is not only the soldiers fighting at the front but also the determination and perseverance of everyone in the rear to act as their support. In the face of a serious situation and a dangerous encounter, we should break through it with the great, upright, central, and righteous spirit of the great Chinese nation and with arduous and unyielding struggle! Everyone should be a "great man who cannot be corrupted by wealth, moved by poverty, or subdued by force"! Everyone should actively "love to learn, practice diligently, and know shame" in order to advance to the realm of "wisdom, benevolence, and courage"! Regardless of any class or occupation, all the people are important members of enriching the national power. We must unite under the same ideology, the same goal, the same steps, and the same action, under the command of our highest leader, to fight against the enemy with the same hatred and make a desperate struggle! We must seek the total achievement from the individual efforts of the people throughout the country. This is the truly most reliable and greatest strength of the entire nation.</p>
<p>Based on my experience in serving as a police officer for three years, I deeply know that the relationship between the police and the people must be that the police do a good job, and then the people have excellent teachers and nannies. Furthermore, by training the people and organizing the people, it is possible to mold the general populace into modernized citizens. Then the entire nation can overcome all difficulties, can speak of self-existence, and can also speak of co-existence. The wind and rain are dark, but the rooster does not stop crowing. I will carefully devote my humble efforts and work doubly hard, and I hope that the gentlemen of the country will encourage each other.</p>
<h3>Cai Jinjun, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau</h3>
<h3>Public Works in Shanghai Municipality</h3>
<p>— Shen Yi</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Municipal Government, under the two major guidelines of constructing a new urban area and reorganizing the old urban area, all works, such as the planning of road systems and city zoning, the construction of roads, ditches, bridges, wharves, embankments, and municipal houses, the dredging and repair of rivers and seawalls, and the supervision and control of private construction, have been implemented sequentially and actively promoted. A summary is given below:</p>
<p>(1) Planning of Road Systems</p>
<p>The construction of a modernized city requires road systems and route plans, and the planning of road systems is the basic work for constructing and reorganizing urban areas. This is because it is of utmost importance to urban traffic and the arrangement of buildings. In the past ten years, the following have been successively stipulated and announced: the main road system of the whole city, the road systems of each district of the whole city, and the routes of each road included in the road systems of each district.</p>
<p>(2) Planning City Zoning</p>
<p>In order to promote the sound development of municipal administration, the city, after considering various needs and investigating actual conditions, has divided the following areas:</p>
<p>㊀ Administrative Area: The central part of the city center.</p>
<p>㊁ Industrial Areas: Both banks of the Wusong River and the Yunzaobang River, south of Guohuo Road in Nanshi, the area along Liuying River and Hengbang River in Zhabei, and the area along the bank from Qingning Temple to Yangsi Port in Pudong.</p>
<p>㊂ Residential and Commercial Areas: Within the city walls of the Hubei area, south of Yu Yuan Road in Huxi, north of Hongqiao Road, west of Haige Road, and east of Kaixuan Road.</p>
<p>㊃ Oil Pond Area: Gaoqiao Sand</p>
<p>㊄ Timber Industry Area: The area along the river from the south end of the Beipiao Coal Mining Company to Jiangshan Road.</p>
<p>(3) Construction and Reorganization of Roads and Ditches</p>
<p>㊀ The main roads in the city center that connect commercial ports, wharves, railways, and traffic in various districts have been completed, including Qimei Road, Huangxing Road, Sanmin Road, Wuquan Road, Songhu Road, Shuidian Road, Zhayin Road, and part of Zhongshan North Road. The secondary roads that have been completed include the roads within the scope of the first and second reclamations and the staff reclamation. The roads within the scope of the third reclamation are under construction. The sewers under each road adopt a combined system, and preparations are being made to build sewage treatment plants at the points where the main pipes enter small rivers, using sedimentation methods to remove the sludge and discharge the remaining water into the river. All ditches and pipes in the first and second reclamations and the staff reclamation have been completely laid out, and the laying of ditches and pipes in the third reclamation is currently underway.</p>
<p>㊁ In the Hunan area, the original streets were mostly hardened street surfaces. In the past ten years, the main roads have been opened and reorganized in order, such as Dongmen Road, Heping Road, and the section of Guoma Road from Dongmen Road to Damatou Street, all of which have been equipped with ditches and pipes and paved with asphalt road surfaces. In addition, new ditches have been laid out at Lujiazui Road, Xietu Road, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Dapu Road, and Luban Road.</p>
<p>㊂ The roads in the Zhabei area are mostly paved with cobblestones. After successive renovations, Datong Road, Gonghe Road, Hengfeng Road, and a section of Baoshan Road were rebuilt with asphalt road surfaces and equipped with water pipes. After the "January 28th" Incident, the construction in the area was almost completely destroyed. Therefore, according to the prescribed plan, the routes of each road were thoroughly reorganized, and the northern section of Baoshan Road, as well as Qiujiang Road, Baoxing Road, Binchang Road, Hongdian Road, and Baoyuan Road, were rebuilt with cold asphalt road surfaces, and Shuidian Road was rebuilt with poured asphalt road surfaces. In addition, the streets in Jiangwan and Wusong were completely destroyed by the war, and they were reorganized according to the prescribed routes. For example, Songxing Road and Tongyu Road in Wusong, and Wan'an Road in Jiangwan, have all been equipped with ditches and pipes and the road surfaces have been rebuilt.</p>
<p>㊃ In the Pudong area, Pudong Avenue was opened and built, and Chunshan Street was reorganized. In total, 84,171 meters of asphalt roads, 3,915 meters of small square stone roads, 5,098 meters of gravel roads, 23,125 meters of cobblestone roads, and 222,071 meters of cinder roads have been built in the past ten years. A total of 189,508 meters of large and small ditches have been laid out.</p>
<p>(4) Construction of Bridges, Wharves, and Embankments</p>
<p>㊀ Bridges: The largest rivers in the city are the Huangpu River, followed by the Wusong River and the Yunzaobang River. In order to develop transportation on both banks, a total of 258 bridges have been built in the past ten years, with a total construction cost of more than 938,000 yuan. The larger ones are the Hengji Bridge, Wuzhen Bridge, Caojiadu Bridge, and Zhongshan Road No. 3 Bridge, which cross the Wusong River, and the Yunzaobang Bridge, which crosses the Yunzaobang River (the bridge was destroyed in the "January 28th" Incident shortly after its completion. Although the debris was salvaged and repaired, it can only carry vehicles weighing about six tons).</p>
<p>㊁ Wharves and Embankments: The city is a commercial port, and water and land transportation is extremely complicated. Foreign ships all rely on the Huangpu River, while inland river steamers mostly travel on the Wusong River. Therefore, the construction of wharves and embankments is extremely important. In the past ten years, a total of 94 wharves have been built, costing more than 320,000 yuan. A total of 3,771 meters of new embankments have been built, costing a total of more than 279,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(5) Municipal Buildings: Municipal buildings are roughly divided into the following four categories:</p>
<p>㊀ Buildings related to administrative offices: the municipal government and office buildings of various bureaus in the city center.</p>
<p>㊁ Buildings related to cultural and educational undertakings: sports fields, gymnasiums, swimming pools, libraries, museums, zoos, botanical gardens, and newly built school buildings of various schools.</p>
<p>㊂ Buildings related to public health and public facilities: municipal hospitals, municipal Hunan hospitals, health test laboratories, Shanghai North District health offices, municipal infectious disease hospitals, municipal first cemeteries, vegetable markets in various places, Wusong Park, First Park, Confucius Temple Park, etc.</p>
<p>㊃ Buildings related to civilian welfare undertakings: three civilian residences, such as Quanji’an Road, Xietu Road, and Jiaotong Road, and four civilian villages, such as Zhongshan Road, Qimei Road, Pushan Road, and Taipingqiao Road. A total of 1,848 rooms.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, the construction cost of new municipal buildings has totaled 4,999,248 yuan and 68 cents.</p>
<p>(6) Rivers</p>
<p>The rivers in the city are intricate and mostly tidal, making them prone to siltation. In terms of water conservancy, all of them are in urgent need of dredging; however, due to limited financial resources, only selective projects can be undertaken. In the past ten years, a total of 104,031 meters of rivers have been dredged, 2,806,814 cubic meters of earth have been excavated, and a total of 687,725 yuan and 10 cents have been spent on engineering. The main projects are dredging the Wusong River, Pu Hui Tang, and dredging the wharf area in Hunan.</p>
<p>(7) Seawalls</p>
<p>The city has three seawalls, which are about 24 kilometers long. They have been in disrepair for many years and are in danger of collapsing. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works took over the seawall project in June of the eighteenth year (1929) and made overall plans. However, due to limited funds, the most dangerous parts were repaired first in June of the twenty-first year (1932) and September of the twenty-third year (1934), with a total project cost of more than 686,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(8) Suppression of Construction</p>
<p>Housing is one of the four major needs of life. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works is responsible for guiding, supervising, and suppressing the construction of the entire city. Therefore, construction companies that contract projects must register with the Bureau, and licenses of A, B, or C grades are issued according to their capital and experience so that citizens know what to choose. All buildings in the city must apply for permits in accordance with the regulations, and personnel are dispatched at any time to conduct detailed inspections. If there are any places that do not comply with the regulations, suppression is carried out repeatedly to ensure that they are consistent with the approved original plans, in order to ensure public safety. In the past ten years, the number of new houses has increased greatly, and the quality has also improved a lot. From the establishment to the end of June of the twenty-fifth year (1936), a total of 17,893 licenses were issued, with a total construction area of 4,220,260 square meters and an estimated construction cost of about 136,311,630 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, houses that have been in disrepair for many years are prone to tilting and are dangerous, especially in public places. In addition to the owners taking the initiative to apply for permits to dismantle dangerous buildings in the urban area, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works first notifies them, then urges them to dismantle them. If they still do not comply, they will submit a request to the Municipal Government for approval and then dispatch workers to dismantle them on their behalf to ensure public safety. From the time of establishment to the end of June of the twenty-fifth year, a total of 670,330 square meters of old houses were dismantled.</p>
<p>(9) Conclusion</p>
<p>The construction undertakings of the city are related to the outlook of China and foreign countries, and it is difficult to simplify them due to inferiority. Therefore, the design adopts the modern urban zoning system to seek the sound development of municipal administration. At the same time, the construction of the new urban area and the reorganization of the old urban area are planned and considered together, in order to avoid any bias. The goal is to achieve the construction of a greater Shanghai. However, the jurisdiction is vast, and the financial resources are limited, so it is necessary to weigh the priorities and proceed step by step. Time flies, and ten years have passed. This is a brief account to inform the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Shen Yi, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works</h3>
<h3>A Brief History of the Evolution of Hygiene in Shanghai Municipality Over the Past Decade</h3>
<p>— Li Ting'an</p>
<p>Shanghai is one of the world's commercial ports. Before the past decade, there was no modern hygiene undertaking to speak of. Epidemics were prevalent, and deaths were numerous. Cholera, in particular, was a scourge that was unavoidable every summer and autumn. It was not until August of the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926) that the modern hygiene undertaking began. Since the establishment of a dedicated agency for hygiene affairs, the tap water in Hunan and Hubei has been greatly improved, free cholera vaccination and smallpox vaccination have been carried out, hygiene education, hygiene experiments, suppression of poor food and beverages, management of medical and pharmaceutical professions, school hygiene, and promotion of maternal and infant hygiene have been initiated. All of these are essential measures to reduce disease and improve health. Over time, they have had an indelible effect on epidemic prevention and health care. In addition, what is particularly noteworthy is the progress of citizens' hygiene concepts, the increasing number of cases in which citizens ask the hygiene authorities for guidance and assistance, and the smooth implementation of hygiene laws and regulations, which can be regarded as clear evidence.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Hygiene is in charge of the city's hygiene administration and is one of the administrative agencies directly under the Shanghai Municipal Government. It was reorganized on July 7 of the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927) after taking over the former Songhu Bureau of Hygiene. The person in charge, from July 7 of the sixteenth year of the Republic to October 5 of the twenty-first year (1932), was the former Director Dr. Hu Hongji. Because Dr. Hu died in a car accident, the Shanghai Municipal Government requested the National Government to appoint Ting'an as his successor. He took office on October 24 of the twenty-first year and has served until now. Currently, the Bureau has three sections. The First Section is divided into six divisions: Documents, Accounting, General Affairs, Pharmaceutical Management, Hygiene Education, and Life Statistics. The Second Section is divided into three divisions: Cleaning and Sanitation, General Hygiene, and Meat Inspection. The Third Section is divided into five divisions: Maternal and Infant Hygiene, School Hygiene, Labor Hygiene, Epidemic Prevention, and Medical Treatment. The Bureau of Hygiene is located in the city center, and the Municipal Hospital and Hygiene Test Laboratory are also located here. It is planned to establish hygiene offices in each district of the city to promote various works of preventive medicine, and to set up hospitals or clinics in each district to establish contact with the Municipal Hospital and promote various works of therapeutic medicine. There are also organizations such as infectious disease hospitals and smoking cessation hospitals to meet the needs of special diseases.</p>
<p>The construction of the Shanghai Municipal Hygiene Undertaking has been limited by funding, and there are still many things that need to be completed. However, there has been a gradual progress over the past decade. Especially after January 28, we have spared no effort to build in the midst of oddities in funding. For example, the original Wusong Hygiene Model District Office was destroyed, and the Zhabei Clinic was destroyed. Now, the Wusong District Hygiene Office and the Shanghai North District Hygiene Office have been established. The Jiangwan District Hygiene Office has also been established in the ashes of the war. In addition, permanent treatment beds were not available before January 28. Since January 28, treatment places such as the Wusong District Hospital, Jiangwan District Hospital, Infectious Disease Hospital, Drug Rehabilitation Center, Smoking Cessation Hospital, Municipal Hospital, and Shanghai South Hospital have been set up, with more than 1,100 permanent beds. The Nursing School, Shanghai South District Hygiene Office, New Hygiene Test Laboratory, and Municipal Cemetery were also opened after the January 28th Incident. As Shanghai is an area of ​​interest both at home and abroad, its hygiene undertaking is also noted by municipal administration, hygiene, medical, and other experts at home and abroad. Many public health experts who visited Shanghai have made straightforward criticisms, praising the set policy guidelines and the efforts of the work, which are beyond reproach. Therefore, the harm of epidemics has been greatly reduced, and citizens' hygiene concepts have gradually become widespread. However, various constructions and works are still in the initial stages and need to be expanded in order to achieve complete objectives. The internal reasons for this progress over the past decade are: First, the mayors of the past have attached importance to the relationship between hygiene and municipal administration and have urged them vigorously, and the various agencies under the Municipal Government have been able to cooperate and promote them. Second, the selection of employed personnel is stricter, and they are allowed to stay in their posts for a long time, so that they can be relied upon to persevere and achieve considerable progress. The summary is used to seek the guidance of the reader and to be the south needle for the future.</p>

<h3>Public Utilities in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xu Peihuang</p>
<p>The establishment of public utilities in Shanghai dates back to more than forty years ago. The first to be founded was the Inland Waterworks Company, followed by the Chinese-owned Electric Power Company, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, Baoming, Pudong, Zhenru, Xianghua and other electric power companies, as well as the Shanghai-Taicang, Shanghai-Nanhui, Shanghai-Minhang, and Shanghai-Chuansha long-distance bus companies, which were successively established. As a result, the city gradually had adequate supplies of tap water, electricity, trams, and long-distance buses, and public utilities were roughly established. However, the shortcoming of various industries at that time was that they only paid attention to quantitative development and rarely made qualitative improvements. For example, the total daily water output of the Inland and Zhabei water plants in 1927 was only 76,800 cubic meters, which was not enough to meet the needs, and the water quality was extremely polluted, which was detrimental to health. In terms of electricity, there were as many as six power plants in the city at that time, but the power generation was not enough to meet the demand, so the power plants had to purchase electricity from foreign companies to supplement the supply. In the urban area, there were many places such as northern and western Shanghai where foreign power plants supplied electricity across the border, and the sovereignty and interests were doubly damaged. As for telephone and transportation services, the Ministry of Transportation's telephone bureau was too weak at that time, and the equipment was mostly outdated, making communication inconvenient. Therefore, there were also many places within the city where foreign telephone companies operated across the border. Furthermore, the lack of transportation in southern Shanghai and Zhabei not only inconvenienced the citizens, but also affected the development of the city.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the municipal government, a Public Utilities Bureau was established to specialize in public utilities, and for the past ten years, it has been proceeding separately from the aspects of rectification and development. Fortunately, with the joint efforts of the government and business people, the city's public utilities have undergone a complete transformation. The Inland and Zhabei companies that operate tap water services have both been urged by the Bureau to add equipment. As a result, the daily water output of the Inland Company has increased to 97,000 cubic meters, and that of the Zhabei Company to 68,200 cubic meters, which is quite sufficient to supply the water demand in their respective business areas. The water quality has also been improved and is quite pure. Currently, both companies are carrying out construction projects such as adding water plants, which will increase the water output of the Zhabei Company by 35,800 cubic meters and the Inland Company by 68,000 cubic meters in the future, so the water supply should be even more adequate. The tap water in Pudong has also been planned by the Bureau over the years. The water plant was built by the Municipal Industrial Trust Company and officially started producing water on June 19th this year, with a daily output of 14,500 cubic meters. The tap water in the Wusong area was contracted to be operated by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company in February 1935, after the Bureau signed a contract with the company. The Bureau's water supply department also provides water to the wharves in Xujiahui and southern Shanghai for ship use. As for the places where foreign water companies supplied water across the border in the city, except for the area where roads were built across the border in western Shanghai, which the Bureau is negotiating to recover according to the principles set by the central government, those in the Zhabei and Xujiahui areas have been negotiated and recovered, and are now supplied separately by the Zhabei and Inland companies. The pipelines are gradually becoming more widespread, so it is becoming increasingly convenient for citizens to obtain water.</p>
<p>The rectification of the city's electricity industry was decided by the Bureau in 1927 to unify the power plant plan. Over the past ten years, it has been carried out step by step. The total power generation capacity of the Zhabei Company has been increased to 22,500 kilowatts, the Chinese Company to 16,000 kilowatts, and the Pudong Company to 600 kilowatts. However, this is still not enough to supply the users of the five electric power companies in the city. Therefore, the Bureau urged the Zhabei and Chinese companies to expand their equipment. The Zhabei Company has added two 12,500-kilowatt generators, one of which has been completed and the other is in progress. The Chinese Company is adding two 15,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators, which are still under construction. At the same time, the Pudong Company is also building a 10,000-kilowatt power plant, and all the projects are in progress. Once the equipment of these companies is expanded and completed, the city's electricity consumption will be self-sufficient. As for the area where roads were built across the border in western Shanghai, which was originally supplied by the Shanghai Power Company across the border, the Bureau also negotiated with the company and formed a Sino-foreign joint venture, the Shanghai Western Power Company, which is supervised by the city. The city's telephone service is operated by the Shanghai Telephone Company in the concession area. The rest of the area is operated by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation. Five years ago, the telephone service in the city did not meet the expectations of the citizens. Recently, the bureau has expanded its equipment and replaced the manual switchboards with automatic telephones to make it convenient for citizens to use and communicate quickly. As for the telephones installed by the telephone company across the border in various parts of the city, the Bureau also negotiated with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the company. A temporary telephone contract was signed, stipulating the rights and obligations to protect sovereignty.</p>
<p>As for transportation, the public transportation in southern Shanghai, Zhabei, and Pudong has always been insufficient. Currently, in southern Shanghai, in addition to the Bureau urging the Chinese Electric Power Company to change the second and third tram lines to circular lines, the Bureau is also running municipal buses, and the routes extend from southern Shanghai to Caohejing and Pudong. In Zhabei, buses have also been running since 1928. The routes of the Chinese Bus Company now extend west to Zhenru and east to the Qiujiang Wharf in the city center. As for water transportation on the Huangpu River, since the Bureau established the municipal ferry, travel has gradually become more convenient.</p>
<p>When we talk about the city's public utilities, looking back on the past, it is roughly as described above. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the city, looking to the future, I would like to express my expectations based on what I remember. Shanghai is a major industrial and commercial city with more than 3.8 million citizens. In recent years, affected by the global economic panic, industry and commerce have long been shrouded in a slump and are in a state of decline. Now that the economic tide has shown signs of recovery, the prosperity of the city's industry and commerce will inevitably occur. Affected by this, the demand for water, electricity, and transportation will also increase. Therefore, it is an urgent task to have a good supply of public utilities.</p>
<p>The city currently has three tap water companies, and their locations are quite appropriate. Now, the Inland and Zhabei water plants are both expanding their equipment. It is estimated that after the project is completed, the Inland Company can increase its water output to 165,000 cubic meters, and the Zhabei Company can increase it to 104,000 cubic meters. If we calculate based on the current average daily water consumption per person, the Inland Company is 1.15 liters, and the Zhabei Company is 0.85 liters, then the Inland Company can supply a population of 1.5 million, and the Zhabei Company can supply 1.2 million people. If we estimate based on the population growth rate in the business areas of the two companies in the past ten years, then the current water output of the two companies can maintain the supply for more than ten years, and there is no need to expand in the near future. The Pudong water plant has a daily water output of 14,500 cubic meters. The area is vast and sparsely populated, and the current water demand is still small. As more construction takes place in the future, the plant will be able to exert its capacity. As for the water supply in the Zhenru area, the Bureau has also planned to provide tap water in the near future to facilitate the drinking water of the residents there.</p>
<p>As for the electricity industry, the Zhabei, Chinese, and Pudong power plants are currently actively expanding their equipment. It is estimated that after the prosperity of industry and commerce, the demand for electricity will increase greatly. The three major power plants should continue to expand, and attention should be paid to improving technology and business to reduce the cost of each unit of electricity, so as to reduce the price of electricity and enable citizens to obtain the most enjoyment at the lowest cost. The supply should be universal within the city, and electricity should be supplied from the city to neighboring counties to share the benefits of centralized power generation. The urgent task of the telephone service is to continue to expand the lines and universally install automatic telephones to make it convenient to install and communicate. Previously, in order to limit the telephone company from expanding telephone users in the city, a temporary contract was signed. However, for a fundamental solution, a permanent contract should be signed. Then, the problems of direct communication between the special zone and the city, and the abolition of telephone charges, can be discussed in a timely manner. Although this is the responsibility of the Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, the Bureau, in order to seek the welfare of the citizens, should do its best to assist in its completion.</p>
<p>As for transportation, the Bureau has previously determined a five-year plan, which will be implemented step by step and in phases to improve it. The biggest shortcoming at present is the lack of connection between the north and south of the city. The method of connection is suitable for running high-speed subways or elevated trains. However, subway construction is not suitable for the city's geology, and the project is huge, requiring a lot of money, which the city's current financial resources cannot afford. As for elevated trains, the project and funding must be approved by the concession authorities. In the current situation, the connection of ground transportation is also urgently needed. However, public transportation in Zhabei is still lacking. Therefore, the Bureau is comprehensively solving the problem of how to promote convenient public transportation in Zhabei and how to connect the north and south traffic, so as to facilitate the travel of citizens and benefit both time and economy. The above is what we look forward to in the future, and it is our responsibility. We should aim for this goal and strive to achieve it. As for whether the promotion can be smooth, we hope that the citizens of the city will supervise and support us, so that Shanghai's public utilities will become more and more developed, which would be very fortunate.</p>
<h3>Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau</h3>
<h3>Land Administration in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xu Fu</p>
<p>The area of the districts already taken over by the city is 530.7 square kilometers, with 786,891 mu of land, of which 529,107 mu belong to the old Shanghai County and 257,784 mu belong to the old Baoshan County. Of the old Shanghai County, 438,178 mu of household land have been surveyed and measured, and 90,929 mu have not been surveyed and measured. After the survey and measurement, 171,906 households have surrendered their old deeds and been issued land certificates. Since registration began on April 1st this year, 6,540 households have applied for registration.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the municipal government, a Land Bureau has been specially established to handle land affairs, with precise designs for surveying and thorough rectification of land registration. However, because the old fish scale maps were lost early, and the existing grain registers were disorganized and confusing, lawsuits over property rights were almost daily occurrences. Due to the high land prices in the city, even a slight difference can amount to tens of millions of dollars. People compete for interests, and the registers have no clear records, making it difficult to resolve disputes, delaying the process. The rectification work has been difficult, and the progress of land administration has been slow.</p>
<p>The city area is divided into Shanghai and Baoshan counties. The Shanghai County part has not been re-measured since the land survey in the fifth year of Xianfeng, so there are many disputes. The current survey work is actively underway, and it is expected to be completed by the end of March next year. However, after the survey, people must look at the map to identify the boundaries themselves, sign and submit it to the bureau, and it will be confirmed if there are no objections from the neighbors. However, people are still indifferent to registration. The old deeds have not been submitted to the bureau, and the maps cannot be viewed and identified. Although the survey has been completed, the boundaries have not yet been determined. Registration is delayed, and new certificates cannot be issued. If strict supervision is not enforced to complete the work in one go, the process will be prolonged, the terrain will change, and all efforts will be wasted. Therefore, for each district that has been surveyed, the municipal committee has been consulted to send personnel to practice in order to assist in the district registration. If the trial is effective, the registration of the old Shanghai County part can be successfully completed within a few years.</p>
<p>The old Baoshan County part was surveyed and measured in the third year of Xuantong, and the maps and registers are complete. However, because the road foundations have not been removed in many places after road construction, and there are occasional changes in the terrain that have not been re-measured, it is easy to make mistakes if registration is based on them. Therefore, it is temporarily postponed in this area. Once the survey of the old Shanghai County part is completed, a plan will be made for the next step. If people must request registration, it can be done after the survey.</p>
<p>The registration of land ownership is based on the surveyed land registration, and the implementation of land policy is based on the registered status quo. In addition to reorganizing the land, we must also consider the land use problem, the housing relief problem, the estimation of land prices and fixtures, and the determination of tax rates. Therefore, after the registration is completed, we should classify and count, and determine the overall plan according to the results. We must not only ensure that farmers have their land, but also ensure that residents have their houses. Adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, so that the burden is evenly distributed and life becomes stable, is the only way to talk about land administration.</p>
<p>Although the Bureau has only been reorganized into the Land Bureau for more than a hundred days, it has been promoting and proceeding in accordance with the above plan based on the Land Law every day, such as the implementation of registration, the compilation of land tax registers, the promotion of land price tax, and the design of estimating standard land prices, all of which are recent important works. In the future, after the land price tax is extended to the rural areas, the land with low land prices will be lighter than the land tax. Although it affects revenue, if land administration can be implemented and it is beneficial to the citizens, we should strive to achieve it.</p>
<p>Today is the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the municipal government, and also the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Bureau. In the past ten weeks, through the management and planning of successive mayors and directors, we have achieved today's achievements. In a few more years, all the complex problems and difficult tasks will be completely transformed into neat maps and registers. Any problem can be reviewed at a glance. All the factories, markets, residences, schools, and rural areas in the city will be set up in districts, interspersed with gardens, sports fields, and entertainment venues for citizens to rest and play. All tax rates will be fair and appropriate, affordable for the citizens, and they will be happy to pay. This is the success of the city's land administration, and the success of the Greater Shanghai Plan. Fu, as the person in charge of land administration, respectfully offers a word of congratulations to the municipal government, an announcement to the citizens, and an encouragement to his colleagues.</p>
<h3>Public Security in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ji Zhangjian</p>
<p>Shanghai is one of the front lines of national defense, connecting north and south, shielding several auxiliary areas, with merchants gathering and goods converging. It is not only an important government for commerce, but also a metropolis of China. Since the January 28th Incident, the essence of the area has been tragically destroyed. The areas of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong have become ruins. After the establishment of the May 5th Truce Agreement, the bandit atmosphere in Fujian and Jiangxi became more and more rampant. Our national army stationed in Shanghai was ordered to be transferred to Jiangxi, so the defense of Shanghai became empty. At that time, the responsibility for maintaining public order was borne by the temporarily organized police force. Later, due to the vastness of the area and the hidden dangers of bandits, the municipal government, in order to consolidate defense, followed the example of Jiangsu, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces and requested the government to establish a Security Office to specifically assume the responsibility for public order in this area. With the approval of the Executive Yuan and the Military Commission, the Shanghai Security Office was established on August 1st, 1932. This was the beginning of the establishment of the Shanghai security system.</p>
<p>When the Security Office was first established, it had two regiments under its jurisdiction. The First Regiment was originally the Beijing Police Brigade, which was ordered to be transferred to Shanghai and placed under the control of the municipal government to assist in maintaining public order in the city. Its initial organization was quite different from that of the army. When the Security Office was established, it was transferred to the Security Office and reorganized, and it has become what it is today. The Second Regiment originally belonged to the Sixth Regiment of the Military Police, which was ordered to be transferred to Shanghai to take on defense tasks. It was also transferred to the Security Office. The organization of the regiment was still sound. Only the team number was changed when it was transferred.</p>
<p>Initially, the position of Director of the Security Office was concurrently held by Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai. Later, Mayor Wu resigned from his concurrent position on October 1st of that year because he was too busy with municipal government affairs. The vacancy was succeeded by Director Yang Hu. Director Yang made many plans for Shanghai's security during his three and a half years in office. When Director Yang was promoted to Commander of the Songhu Garrison, the municipal government was approved to reorganize the Security Office into the Security General Regiment in April 1936, and Zhang Jian was appointed as the Commander of the General Regiment. Looking back on the Security General Regiment since it was ordered to reorganize, its scale and rules are roughly the same as in previous years. However, because the municipal government has been financially strained in recent years, former Mayor Wu Tiecheng has repeatedly encouraged us to economize on expenses. Since Zhang Jian took office, he has strictly followed the collective training, and all facilities are based on reducing expenditures. It is estimated that there are only more than 20 officers above the rank of warrant officer in the General Regiment.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the headquarters, there have been many soldiers who have deserted, taken long leave, or are old and weak. Therefore, on September 1st, 1936, we requested to recruit soldiers to supplement the ranks, but the organization remained the same as before. This is the general situation after the reorganization of the General Regiment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because the training of this unit cannot be delayed or slowed down, we have formulated an outline according to the actual situation of the unit and implemented phased training. The training scope is divided into recruit training, non-commissioned officer training, heavy weapons team training, and officer training. In order to accurately understand the progress of all units, inspections are held regularly to ensure that officers and soldiers are brave and know how to defend the territory and protect the people.</p>
<p>Maintaining local public order is the sole responsibility of the Security Regiment. However, Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and the good and bad are mixed. Moreover, the concession is located here, and there are many obstacles in administration. Bad people hide in the concession, plotting to do evil, and guiding and dealing with them is often difficult. On September 23rd, 1936, the Japanese marine incident occurred. The situation was tense, and rumors spread. The citizens of northern Shanghai were in a state of panic. The rich moved to the concession, and the poor were startled several times a night. At that time, public order depended entirely on the Security Team and the police to maintain it, and they went to various places to inform the citizens not to easily believe rumors, so as not to expand the incident. Although the situation has now eased, we are still on alert as before and dare not slack off. Therefore, since the establishment of the General Regiment, no unexpected incidents have occurred. The mission has been well received by the public. As is customary in Shanghai, winter defense must be prepared at the end of each year. According to the winter defense orders and winter defense plans issued by the Songhu Garrison Command, vigilance is carried out, and there has been no interruption for several years. In addition, the General Regiment and the police are also responsible for the security of various airports in Shanghai, the suppression of labor and student strikes, and the special vigilance of railway stations. As for the garrison area, the troops are scattered in various places in southern and northern Shanghai, and the garrison locations are scattered like stars. Starting from the Shizilin Fort in the north and ending in Longhua in the south, the defense area is about 50 kilometers wide. Defense is set up according to the location to ensure its thoroughness, and special attention is paid to the security of Zhabei, where people live densely. The above is the actual situation of public security and administration in Shanghai in the past five years. July 7th is the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government. A special issue is published, and Zhang Jian is asked to contribute an article. Zhang Jian is not literate, so he recounts the experience to record the evolution.</p>

Then, Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech on behalf of the guests, saying, "Our country's thousands of years of civilization can be proven in literature. Since it is called literature, it should be presented to the public and not treasured as a secret. Moreover, when studying calligraphy and painting, we should not only view it with aesthetic eyes but also savor its meaning, perhaps emulating its fine words and deeds."</p>

The project is complex, the light is clear, the layers of buildings change in an instant, the wind and clouds roar, and dragons and snakes appear completely. A string of beads hangs high in the air, reflecting the mirage. A little light, the green light of the cloud hall, leads out all kinds of reds and purples. It is said that in order to avoid crowding, the manager of the market specially combined the Penglai Theater, Guanghan Palace Yue Opera Theater, Jinxiuge Spring Opera Theater, Tianlewo Shanghai Opera Theater, and Yingbingguan Southern Opera Theater, attaching a scientific fireworks viewing ticket to the ticket at that time, and entering the venue with the ticket in an orderly manner, which is a unique creation in the entertainment industry.</p>

Furthermore, if vacancies arise among the candidates after July 2nd, there is no need to submit a request for replacements; the General Headquarters will send separate telegrams to inform accordingly. Additionally, the National Election Office in this city, to expand publicity and allow candidates to introduce themselves, previously invited fifteen individuals, including Du Yuesheng, to broadcast speeches. Now, twelve more individuals, including Song Ziliang, have been invited to broadcast. Yesterday, Mr. Tao and Mr. Jiang broadcasted, attracting a large audience. Details are as follows:</p>

<p>Absence from the Venue Deemed as Abstention</p>
<p>"To the Election Supervisor of Shanghai Municipality: Regarding the supplementary methods for voting by illiterate citizens and those who are blind or disabled and unable to write, this office has reviewed and decided that each voting inspector should be responsible for reading out the names of all candidates in order, prefacing each name with the words 'Number [ordinal number],' so that illiterate citizens can circle their choices accordingly. For those who are blind or disabled and unable to write, designated personnel appointed by the election supervisor may write on their behalf, and the election inspectors should sign or affix their seals to prevent malfeasance. As for those who are too old or weak, or ill, and unable to attend the venue to vote, they should be deemed to have abstained and may not appoint a proxy. This is urgently telegraphed; please comply accordingly. National Election General Headquarters, winter (no date printed)."</p>
<p>Candidate Vacancies Will Not Be Filled</p>
<p>"To the Election Supervisor of Shanghai Municipality: This office previously set the end of June as the deadline for various candidates to apply to withdraw, which has been circulated separately. Now, considering that the date for the re-election is approaching very closely, and the procedures that election offices in various places must complete after receiving the list of candidates approved by this office are extensive, if the matter of replacing candidates is still delayed indefinitely, the back-and-forth communication will delay the process and inevitably cause the election period to be missed. Therefore, it is specifically stipulated that after July 2nd, if vacancies occur among any of the various candidates due to any reason and replacements are required, all vacancies may be left unfilled, and there is no need to submit a request for replacements. Apart from separate circulation, this is urgently notified for your information. National Election General Headquarters, winter (no date printed)."</p>

<h3>Li Liejun's Condition Improving Daily</h3>
<p>Temperature Returning to Normal Yesterday; Speech Clear and Natural</p>
<p>Since Mr. Li Liejun of the Central Committee went to various places for convalescence in the spring, he has been in good spirits these past few days, enjoying the scenery. Recently, he came to Shanghai from West Lake, as the weather became hotter and to avoid the hustle and bustle. He temporarily resided in the He Lu of the Huisheng Society within the Baohua Temple in Dachang. The flowers and trees were lush, and the pond was surrounded by tranquility. Around 8 PM on the 2nd of this month, while leaning on the railing to watch the fish, he caught a cold evening breeze and suddenly experienced numbness in his left side, a crooked mouth with drooling, and a blurred mind. Fortunately, Dr. Wu Shuzuo, who was on standby, rushed to support him, preventing him from falling. He was moved to the room, and ice was immediately purchased from Shanghai to protect his brain with an ice pack. Doctors Li Meiling and Liu Zhigang, who were consulted, prescribed injections together. He was out of danger that night. By noon the next day, his left foot could move, and his mind gradually cleared. Dr. K.D. Loewenberg. M.D. from the German Hospital was also consulted, and Dr. Li Qifang came from Beijing to join the other doctors in careful treatment. On the 4th and 5th, there was further improvement. He has been taking orange juice, milk, and thin porridge, and bowel movements were induced twice with enemas. Yesterday, his temperature, pulse, and blood pressure returned to normal, and he could move his left side freely. His speech was clear. According to the doctors, he will be able to move in a week, or enter a sanatorium for quiet recuperation. The original plan to go to Lushan on the 7th to escape the summer heat has now been cancelled to avoid the fatigue of travel.</p>

<h3>Money Exchange Industry Unanimously Refuses to Exchange Fake Manchukuo Currency</h3>
<p>Printing Forms to Implement Swearing; Civic Associations Rise Up in Opposition</p>
<p>The news that Japanese banks such as Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Bank of Chosen, and Shanghai Bank are transporting and exchanging "fake Manchukuo" Central Bank notes in Shanghai has drawn significant attention from all sectors of our country. Yesterday, reporters from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with money exchange businesses and learned that these fake Manchukuo notes are in denominations of one, five, and ten yuan, calculated in Japanese yen (103 yen per day is approximately equal to 100 national currency). The first batch has already arrived in Shanghai and is exclusively used in Japanese stores. The association has sent personnel to thoroughly investigate member money changers, making it clear that they should unanimously refuse to exchange these notes. Once the swearing forms are printed, they will immediately swear to refuse to exchange them, and those who violate the oath will be subject to the most severe penalties. Because money changers refuse to exchange them, these notes will not flow into Chinese stores and can only be used in Japanese stores. At the same time, various Chinese stores and people have decided to refuse to use them. It was also learned that the Shanghai South Office of the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association issued an emergency notice yesterday, stating that upon reading the newspaper report of the Money Exchange Association warning its members not to exchange fake Manchukuo Central Bank notes, our industry should pay particular attention. At a time when the public is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the municipal government and holding lantern festivals, it is inevitable that villains will take the opportunity to mix in and exchange with our members. We hope everyone will pay attention and avoid mistakenly exchanging them, resulting in losses. Furthermore, the 39th, 38th, and 40th district branches of the First Special District Citizens' Association of this city, based on reports that Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Bank of Chosen, Shanghai Bank and other banks in this city recently transported a large number of "fake Manchukuo" Central Bank notes to Shanghai for exchange and have entrusted six money changers to promote and exchange them, are deeply alarmed. If this matter is true, it will not only disrupt the market's finances, but also, since "fake Manchukuo" is an illegal organization, if unscrupulous merchants covet petty profits and use counterfeit currency, it would indirectly acknowledge the relationship with fake Manchukuo, which is extremely important. Therefore, after collective discussion, it was decided to first send personnel to conduct district investigations and advise merchants and residents that if such counterfeit currency is found in the market, they should refuse to use it. At the same time, they also plan to petition the party and government authorities to conduct a thorough investigation and stop it.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Students Studying in Japan Petitioned Xu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xu Immediately Telegraphed the Embassy to Rescue Them First</p>
<p>Ye Wenjin, a representative of various student groups studying in Japan, Yao Qianxiu, a classmate in Shanghai, and Lu Yaowu, a student who was arrested and sent back to China, visited Mr. Xu Shiying, our ambassador to Japan, at No. 588 Rue du Père Robert, at 4 PM yesterday (the 6th). Mr. Xu, despite being ill, came downstairs to meet them and said that he was very sorry that he was unable to rescue the Chinese students who were repeatedly arrested, detained, and sent back to China by Japan recently because he was staying in the country. He didn't know if similar incidents were still happening. Mr. Ye said that Huang Yihuan (i.e., the son of Mr. Huang Keqiang), Chen Qiuhuan, and Li Yisan, among others, had recently been arrested and detained without release. Mr. Xu instructed Secretary Huang to draft a telegram to the embassy in Japan to negotiate for rescue as appropriate. While they were talking, Mr. Huang drafted the telegram, and Mr. Xu read and dispatched it immediately. Next, Mr. Ye handed over a letter from various student groups in Japan to Mr. Xu. After reading it, Mr. Xu said that he had already informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education separately when he returned to China about the areas that should be improved in the protection and management of students studying in Japan. He did not know if it had been enacted into law. Now that the situation of students studying in Japan is like this, he will specifically go to Beijing to seek a proper solution to satisfy the students' wishes. Mr. Ye also presented several points that students studying in Japan wanted to request from the authorities, divided into four items. Mr. Xu studied them one by one and agreed to study and proceed with the steps when he arrived in Beijing, and said that the third item had already been taken care of. Ambassador Xu was very concerned about the students studying in Japan and talked with the three gentlemen Ye, Yao, and Lu for about two hours. The four requests of the students studying in Japan to Ambassador Xu are recorded as follows: (1) Please forward a protest to the Japanese government from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs against the arbitrary arrest and expulsion of our students studying in Japan. (2) For the currently arrested students Huang Yihuan, Chen Qiuhuan, Deng Keqiang, Li Yisan, and others, please telegram the embassy in Japan to negotiate reasonably and release them immediately. (3) Make representations to the Japanese authorities that, in the future, students should not be detained in the police station, subjected to private torture, or arbitrarily beaten and humiliated. (4) Please ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to find a way to effectively protect the safety of students studying in Japan.</p>

<h3>National Goods Loan Syndicate Established</h3>
<p>Eleven Banks Including the Bank of China Formed a Joint Venture; Handling Drafts and Factory Loans</p>
<p>The development of national goods has been extremely rapid in recent years. Since the establishment of the National Goods Joint Venture Company, the future of the national goods industry has become even more optimistic. The former National Goods Office, in view of the urgent need to seek further development of our country's national goods industry and to enrich the circulation of funds, specially negotiated with the banking industry to transport funds to support the growth of the national goods industry. The banking industry also believes that the cultivation of the national goods industry is of great importance to the national economy, so they unanimously expressed their approval. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were responsible for contacting various banks to determine the organization of a national goods banking group to concentrate their efforts. The principle has long been determined, but the total amount of funds in the banking group and the number of allocations to each bank have not been completely determined. According to reporters from the Shenzhou News Agency, due to the eager expectations of all parties, the banking group specially convened a meeting of representatives of various banks and representatives of national goods manufacturers at the Banking Association yesterday to discuss various specific issues. It was agreed that the total amount of funds in the National Goods Banking Group would be 3 million yuan, and the number of allocations to each bank would be allocated as follows: (1) Bank of China, 1 million yuan; (2) Bank of Communications, 800,000 yuan; (3) National Goods Bank, 300,000 yuan; (4) New China Bank, 200,000 yuan; (5) Four Banks Savings Society, 100,000 yuan; (6) China-South, 100,000 yuan; (7) Continent, 100,000 yuan; (8) Jincheng, 100,000 yuan; (9) Salt Industry, 100,000 yuan; (10) Shanghai, 100,000 yuan; (11) Fuyuan Money House, 100,000 yuan.

<h3>16th Hygiene Campaign Opened Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Li Tingan Reported the Significance; Yu Urged Hygiene to Save the Country</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of the 10th Summer Hygiene Campaign, initiated and organized by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, was held at the Municipal Public Education Hall on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Chairman Li Tingan delivered the opening remarks, stating that today is the closing day of the 16th Summer Hygiene Campaign in Shanghai. We have hygiene campaigns every year, but the results are not obvious, which is truly regrettable. The hygiene campaign is initiated by the Municipal Health Bureau and sponsored by various organs and groups such as the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. This campaign is divided into four groups: publicity, epidemic prevention, inspection, and training. Each group is responsible for dispatching personnel from various organs and groups. In addition to the grand ceremony held here today, there will also be a lantern parade and a motorcade parade. The time is 5:00 PM today, gathering and departing from the Municipal Government's Wuquan Road. One is to make citizens pay attention and recognize it, and the other is to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the municipal government. At the same time, this kind of campaign cannot be undertaken by one or two people. It depends on the power of the masses and common sponsorship, so I especially hope that everyone present will not hesitate to teach us in the future. Deputy Mayor Yu, on behalf of Zheng Xuehai, delivered a training speech, stating that the significance of the hygiene campaign is nothing more than to make citizens pay attention and recognize it. If we want to save the country, we must first exercise and strengthen everyone's body, especially the power of mind, intelligence, thought, and wealth, because only when this kind of power is sound can a person's whole body be considered sound. If the people are not sound, it will affect the whole country, so if we want to revive and save the country, we must start with paying attention to hygiene. Finally, he shouted slogans. Starting at 5:00 PM, a lantern parade was held, with participants from more than 20 organs and groups such as the Health Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, the Police Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Social Bureau, the New Movement Promotion Association, the Security Committee, the Public Works Department Health Department, the General Labor Union, the Municipal Education Association, the YMCA, the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, the New Pharmaceutical Industry, and the Public Education Hall. In the evening, Mayor Yu and others broadcasted their speeches.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Jointly with Police and Social Bureaus Reviewed the Yarn Exchange Account Books Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Market Opened Yesterday; Yarn Prices Plummeted and Trading Was Halted</p>
<p>Following the administrative punishment by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for the market turmoil at the Chinese Yarn Exchange, the part concerning the suspected manipulation by public officials Wu Qiding and Sheng Shengyi has been handed over to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yan Shenyu, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, led the Kuang and Wang section chiefs, along with central representatives and personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Police and Social Bureaus, to re-examine the account books from related brokers yesterday morning. They extracted the account books from 9:00 AM and reviewed them at the Central District Social Bureau until 4:00 PM. Furthermore, the cotton yarn market opened yesterday, and cotton yarn prices plummeted, causing trading to be halted.</p>
<h3>The Times Reports New Progress in the Concession's Opium Suppression</h3>
<p>Seriously Considering the Issue of Issuing Licenses; Agreement on Methods Must Be Discussed with the Consular Body</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Municipal Council has in principle agreed to establish opium registration offices in the Public Concession. Therefore, at the meeting on June 30th, the Council appointed Chairman Fessenden, Chief of Police Jarrad, and Council Solicitor Boland to form a special committee to study the most appropriate methods for establishing the agency for the Council to adopt, and to study the agreement that the Council must conclude with the Shanghai Municipal Government regarding the opium suppression procedures of the Nanjing Government. According to reliable sources, the Council believes that the Chinese authorities should be responsible for the issuance of licenses to opium addicts in the concession, and the Council opposes the opening of licensed opium dens in the concession. In other words, although opium registration offices are established in the concession, the Council will only notify the Chinese authorities of the names of those who register, and the Council's responsibility is limited to this. Once registration offices are established in the concession, opium addicts in the concession should register at the offices, or they will suffer adverse consequences. The committee is currently considering allowing the Shanghai Municipal Government to appoint several representatives to participate in the opium registration offices in the concession. The resolution previously passed by the Council had allowed the Chinese authorities to issue licenses to opium addicts in the concession. Therefore, the committee is now seriously considering the issue of whether these licenses should be issued by the concession registration offices. It is rumored that if the funds for the concession registration offices are insufficient, they can be subsidized by the Chinese authorities, but according to those closely related to the issue, this does not seem necessary, as the expenses required for the registration offices can be covered by a portion of the registration fees. In other words, the registration fees will be paid directly to the Municipal Council, which will allocate the license fees to the Shanghai Municipal Government. Furthermore, the most complex issue that the committee must discuss is how to deal with those who violate the opium suppression laws. According to the current method, violators are sent to the First Special District Court for punishment. Yesterday, a senior official of the Council expressed the opinion that the Ward Road Prison is detaining a large number of drug offenders, and this issue will be fully discussed. It is rumored that the Council intends to hand over all drug offenders to the Chinese authorities and detain them in the Caohejing Prison. It is now known that this statement is unfounded, as the Council has not made any decision on anything other than agreeing in principle to establish registration offices in the concession. It is said that Chief of Police Jarrad's participation in the special committee may indicate that the police will play an important role in the management of the registration offices, and the registration offices may even be managed by the police. However, what requires special attention is that before the Council agrees on any methods with the Chinese authorities, it may be necessary to consult with the Consular Body.</p>

<p>The weather in Shanghai yesterday remained extremely hot, and there was a sharp increase in patients at various plague hospitals. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Heatwave Didn't Subside</p>
<p>Although there was a thunderstorm in Shanghai the night before last, it stopped soon after, so the weather yesterday was still extremely hot. According to the observatory report, the temperature rose to 94.1 degrees at noon. The roads were exposed to the scorching sun for days, causing them to melt and stick to shoes, which could be seen everywhere. Residents all suffered from the heat and tried to find ways to cool down.</p>

<h3>Japanese Youth Recounts Almost Falling into a Love Trap</h3>
<p>The Horror of Being Lured by a Japanese Woman; A Poor Scholar's Comedy and Tragedy</p>
<p>The Japanese-language "Shanghai Daily" reported that a young man from Tokyo, 25 years old, took a vacation to Nagasaki. On the train, he met a young Japanese woman, and they had a pleasant conversation. After arriving in Nagasaki, the young man decided to pursue the woman, so they went to Shanghai together. However, before he even set foot on shore, his dream was shattered. After spending one night in Shanghai, he took the Shanghai Maru back to Japan on Sunday morning. According to the young man, he told the Japanese Consulate Police that the woman claimed to be single and willing to marry him, and said that he could easily find a job in Shanghai. He thought it was a fortunate coincidence and should not be missed, so he followed her across the sea to Shanghai from Nagasaki. During the 28-hour voyage, he felt as if he was in a paradise. However, when the ship arrived at the wharf, he first saw the woman waving a handkerchief to a man on the shore, and then saw the man board the ship to take care of her luggage. In an instant, the woman and the man came to him, and the woman happily introduced the man as her husband, and thanked him for his kindness along the way. At that time, he was stunned and speechless. After regaining his composure, he went ashore and wandered along the Bund. A police officer from the Japanese Consulate saw that he looked different and took him to the consulate. He told the whole story and said that he had no money. He pawned his watch and ring for money to stay at a Japanese hotel. The next morning, he returned to his country, feeling both funny and tragic.</p>
<h3>Conclusion of the Inquiry into the Workers' Horseplay Case Resulting in Death</h3>
<p>Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Gong Zhaolu, Li Jinfu, and Cao Changshan from Taizhou were workers in the fine yarn workshop of the Japanese-owned Yufeng Cotton Mill at 2866 Yangshupu Road. On the afternoon of May 29th, around 7 p.m., they pulled their 22-year-old colleague Miao Changwang (also from Taizhou) into a small room to engage in horseplay, pulling off his pants. Miao resisted vigorously and was injured in the abdomen. At that time, a Japanese inspector arrived, notified by child laborer Jiang Xiaojin, and they all returned to their work positions. Miao suddenly felt severe abdominal pain at midnight and was taken by someone to the Yufeng Workshop Clinic on Dinghai Road. He died at 7 a.m. the next morning. Subsequently, Gong and others paid for a coffin and encoffined the body, temporarily placing it in a deserted area of Jiangjiabang on Huade Road. Later, Dong Dexian, a Taizhou native who cooked meals for the workshop, sent a letter to the deceased's father, Miao Senxiang, in Shanghai. Miao Senxiang's entanglement with Gong Zhaolu and others broke down, and he reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station. Chinese and Western detectives arrested Gong, Li, and Cao and sent them to the First Special District Court. Miao Changwang's body was exhumed for an autopsy, and it was also found that She A'er, the foreman of the fine yarn workshop at the time, also participated in pulling off Jiao Changwang's pants and putting them over his head, so Yin was added to the defendant list. The deceased's father, Miao Senxiang, hired a lawyer to file a civil suit, demanding compensation for various losses, totaling 2,000 yuan. Yesterday, Judge Dai Rongduo came to court for a continued hearing. Yin A'er hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. The judge ordered them to be remanded in custody and await sentencing.</p>

The French officials, gentry, merchants, scholars, overseas Chinese, and other communities in Shanghai have held enthusiastic celebrations in previous years. As the date approaches, the French Consul ordered the engineering department of the French Municipal Council to prepare for the decorations.

<h3>The Contribution of the Christian Literature Society to Literature</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Museum, the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office, and collectors from various circles have launched a literature exhibition and have collected a large number of treasures. Here is a brief introduction to the books from the Christian Literature Society in the collection, in order to give visitors a full understanding, and also to let the public understand the great efforts the Christian Literature Society made in introducing Western learning and contributing to culture in the early days of the Reform Movement in China. The Christian Literature Society is tucked away in a corner of the Museum Road, specializing in religious and literary undertakings. The new era and the figures of the new era no longer pay attention. However, the editors and writers of the Christian Literature Society, such as Westerners like Timothy Richard, Young J. Allen, Williamson, Ting Tik-liang, Calvin Mateer, and Chinese like Cai Erkan, Shen Jueqi, and Zhao Jinqing, were all first-class scholars from China and the West. As for the "Wan Guo Gong Bao," "Da Tong Bao," and "Zhong Xi Jiao Hui Bao," which they sponsored in 1889, they were not only the authorities of public opinion, the pioneers of culture, and the mentors of youth at that time, but many of the writers were also giants of the Reform Movement, such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. In the culture of the past, the Christian Literature Society really fulfilled its duties as a nanny. The books published by the society that have historical value are briefly reported one by one below: (1) "The Complete Account of the Sino-Japanese War," edited by Young J. Allen and Cai Erkan, two volumes in total. The first volume of the first volume is incomplete. This book is based on accurate reports from the Chinese government at that time and historical materials from European and American intelligence agencies. It is indeed the only credible history of the Sino-Japanese War. (2) "From West to East," edited by Hua Zhian (first published in Hong Kong, then reprinted by the Christian Literature Society). This book was the only book that introduced new knowledge and Western administration to China sixty years ago. At that time, Chinese scholars were eager to read it. (3) "Universal History," compiled and translated by Li Silun from Johnston, and written by Cai Erkan, three volumes in total. This is a complete world history, not only with detailed materials, but also with beautiful writing. (4) "A General Investigation of Women's Customs in the Five Continents," compiled and translated by Young J. Allen and Ren Baoluo, ten volumes in twenty-one books in total. This book records the customs of women in various countries in great detail. Although the times have changed, there is still no women's series published in modern China that surpasses it. (5) "Children's Newspaper," edited by Mu Dasheng, a bound volume. This book is the earliest and most precious reading material for adult children. (6) "Wan Guo Gong Bao" (from 1889 to 1907), (7) "Da Tong Bao" (from 1904 to 1917), (8) "Zhong Xi Jiao Hui Bao" (from 1891 to 1917). These three magazines were the most valuable publications in early China. The writers were all famous scholars at that time, and they worked hard to impart new knowledge. (9) "New Testament" (hardcover one volume), a copy presented to Empress Dowager Cixi. (10) Three copies of the "Old and New Testaments," published by the Yinghua College in Hong Kong, translated seventy-three years ago, are also very valuable. (11) In addition, there are two volumes of Timothy Richard's posthumous works, five volumes of Morrison's Chinese-English Dictionary, and three thousand kinds of illustrations made by the Christian Literature Society in the past fifty years, which not only show the efforts of Christian scholars at that time for China, but also allow us to glimpse all the situations of Chinese society.</p>
<h3>A Legendary Marriage: The Sister Replaces Her Brother as the Groom</h3>
<p>Chen Dequan Enlisted in the Army During the January 28 Incident and Never Returned; Ling Yuxian Was Unwilling to Wait in Vain and Petitioned to Cancel the Marriage</p>
<p>Chen Xiaoxiang, a local of Caoxi Hejing Town in the western district of the city, owned the Sensheng Lace Company. He had a son named Chen Dequan, who was about to turn thirty. When he was young, he was betrothed to Ling Yuxian of 1371 Xinshi Road, Jiangwan. Yuxian is 27 years old this year. However, Chen Dequan was a heroic man who joined the army during the January 28 Incident and has never been heard from since. His life and death are unknown. Unexpectedly, while the sound of gunfire was shaking Shanghai, Chen Xiaoxiang suddenly notified the woman's family, saying that there were many long nights and unpredictable events, so they should get married as soon as possible while they had the chance. Because both sides respected the old etiquette, the fiancé had never met her, so a funny drama like a legend occurred. They got married on April 19th of the lunar calendar that year. However, since the groom Chen Dequan was not at home at the time, Chen Xiaoxiang ordered his daughter (that is, Dequan's sister) to dress up as a man and act as the groom. They bowed to each other, drank the wedding wine, and paid respects to the parents and elders. The bride saw that the groom had a feminine air, and although he was dressed like a man, his gestures resembled a woman. After the ceremony, she returned to the room and found out that it was the sister who had replaced the brother in the marriage. She was shocked and cried out. Chen Xiaoxiang and others comforted their daughter-in-law and said that their son would return soon, so there was nothing to worry about. So the same-sex "husband and wife" lived together until the second day of the first month of the Republic of China's 22nd year. Yuxian could not remain silent and lived with her aunt for three years. Until April 27th of last year, Chen Kaoxiang falsely claimed that his son had returned, and Ling Yuxian was overjoyed and returned home, thinking that she could finally get her wish. Unexpectedly, it was still just an illusion. The anger in her heart was indescribable. She waited until now, but her husband still did not return. How could she wait in vain as a nominal wife, and how could a same-sex marriage with her husband's sister be valid? Therefore, she specially hired lawyer Lu Qi to file a lawsuit in the local court against Chen Kaoxiang, Chen Dequan, and his daughter, requesting the annulment of the illegal marriage, the dissolution of the marriage contract, compensation for damages, and consolation money. Yesterday, Judge Zhu Zhifen opened a mediation hearing to inquire about the cause, but the defendants did not arrive. The court ordered a formal lawsuit to be filed.</p>

Various plans that are beneficial to the body and mind, according to the needs of the members and similar personalities, will be implemented in order, so that each member will not only obtain the greatest convenience when traveling outside, but also treat the group as a second home in peacetime. Then Shen Xingchu, the group's staff member, reported on this solicitation, which is named after the Five Sacred Mountains and the Four Famous Mountains of China, divided into nine teams: Taishan, Huashan, Songshan, Hengshan, Hengshan, Jiuhuashan, Putuoshan, Wutaishan, and Emeishan. Finally, Jin Zongcheng, the captain of the Songshan team, said on behalf of Liu Shaoping that joining the group is not only beneficial to individual travel, but also greatly contributes to the prosperity of townships and the development of national culture and transportation. Finally, Zhou Sizhong thanked the guests for their presence and support. The meeting ended at ten o'clock. It is reported that the group is scheduled to start soliciting members on July 10 and end on August 10.</p>

The troublemaking workers, including Chen Daobiao, were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for punishment according to law.

<h3>The Art &amp; New Silk Factory Workers Sued the Factory Owner for Instigating Injury; The Court Heard The Case Again Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Shu Guirong Attached Civil Suit Demanding Living Expenses; The Defendants Still Insisted on Their Previous Statements, Denying Instigation</p>
<p>Zhou Yueren, a 47-year-old man from Hangzhou, runs the Art &amp; New Silk Factory at 41 Jinjiang Village, Dapuqiao, Xujiahui Road, French Concession. He employs many workers, all from Hangzhou and Shaoxing. Recently, Zhou was sued by worker Shu Guirong in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for instigating workers Zhao Jinshui and Wang Jinzhong to commit injury, requesting an investigation and filing a civil suit to recover monthly living expenses of 100 yuan. According to the lawsuit, on May 26th, the plaintiff and the workers in the factory had a dispute over trivial matters. Zhou Yueren immediately ordered twenty or thirty workers to use wooden sticks and iron rulers to beat the plaintiff, causing injuries and fainting before stopping. The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and was admitted to Guangci Hospital, where he has been receiving medical treatment until now. He has not recovered after a long time. The plaintiff is a poor worker and has elderly parents at home who rely on the plaintiff's work income for support. Now that he has been beaten and injured, he cannot work. He requests that Zhou Yueren, Zhao Jinshui, Wang Quanzhong, etc., be punished accordingly, and that they be ordered to pay a monthly living expense of 100 yuan to the plaintiff until the plaintiff's injury is healed. Based on the lawsuit, Judge Sun Penghan opened a court hearing and summoned the parties. The plaintiff could not move due to his injury and was carried to the court on a rattan chair. He described the beating. When questioned, the defendants all denied instigating the injury. The court ordered Zhou Yueren to pay a deposit of 500 yuan to ensure his appearance when summoned and adjourned the hearing to a later date to summon witnesses for further questioning. Yesterday morning, the court hearing was held again. The plaintiff was represented by his cousin Gao Nianyi (47 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at 3 Xietucun, Xietu Road). The defendants were questioned again and still maintained their previous statements. The court ordered the hearing to be adjourned to the morning of July 15, awaiting the arrival of witnesses for further questioning. Zhou still paid the original deposit.</p>
<h3>A Japanese Man Harasses a Chinese Maid</h3>
<p>Li Xiaomei Files a Complaint with the Police</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, Yoshihara Eitaro, a 28-year-old man from Fukuoka Prefecture, currently residing at 192 Tuqing Road, runs a photography business. Two years ago, he hired a Chinese woman, Li Xiaomei, as a maid. Li is only 29 years old and is quite beautiful. Before long, she was seduced by Yoshihara, and the relationship between master and servant turned into cohabitation. After about half a year, they had a quarrel over trivial matters, and Li left, never to return. After Li left, Yoshihara was consumed by longing for her. Not only did he lose his appetite and sleep, but he even lost his mind to work, almost like a madman. He often went out to look for Li Xiaomei's whereabouts. Until 5 p.m. on the 4th, he suddenly met her on North Sichuan Road. Yoshihara was overjoyed and immediately ordered Li to return home. Li refused. They argued on the road. Li had no choice but to twist Yoshihara to the North Sichuan Road Police Station. According to Li's statement, she had been beaten by Yoshihara and was particularly unhappy about the defendant Yoshihara's adultery. The police station notified the Consulate General and took Yoshihara to the consulate for questioning.</p>

After searching for days, someone said that her husband was working as a weed puller at Longhua Airport, so she went to look for him. However, she was refused entry due to strict security. The woman returned with tears in her eyes. The day before yesterday, her child suddenly died, causing her great sadness and misery. She was also treated coldly by her relatives, and she really had nowhere to turn. Yesterday afternoon, she went to the Dongjiadu Municipal Ferry to try to commit suicide by jumping into the river.

<h3>New-Style Rickshaws Began Operating in the City Center Yesterday</h3>
<p>Fifty Rickshaws Available Today</p>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau has manufactured fifty new-style rickshaws to facilitate traffic in the city center. Manufacturing began in mid-May. It was originally planned to put them into service in early August, but due to the 10th anniversary celebration of the Municipal Government, traffic was insufficient. The rickshaws were completed ahead of schedule, so the newly manufactured rickshaws appeared in the central area yesterday. Today, fifty rickshaws will be fully operational. The style of these vehicles is generally similar to chartered cars, but the body is painted blue, and the side panels are trimmed in black, making the colors very harmonious. They are also equipped with odometers, costing four cents per mile, so there is no need for customers to haggle over the price. However, these vehicles are not allowed to cross the Songhu Railway and can only operate in the city center. The rental fee is six yuan per month, which is different from the daily rental fee for ordinary rickshaws, making it much more convenient for the rickshaw pullers. Blue cloth uniforms have also been made. Rickshaw pullers must wear them to avoid being bare-chested, which would be unsightly.</p>

<h3>Xin Fu Bank's Shanghai Branch Declares Closure Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Based on the Board of Directors' Resolution on the 5th, the Settlement Method will be Determined by the Shareholders' Meeting</p>
<p>Xin Fu Commercial Savings Bank, founded by Fei Zhongshen, Yao Junyu, and others, opened in April of the 18th year of the Republic of China, and has been in operation for eight years. The head office is located in Suzhou, with a total capital of one million yuan, of which five hundred thousand yuan has been paid up. In August and December of the same year, it was approved by both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to be registered. Branches are located in Shanghai, Changzhou and other two places. The current chairman is Chen Yanghe, and the general manager is Lin Youshan. The head office convened a board meeting in Suzhou on the 5th and decided to declare the closure of the business from now on. The Shanghai branch, located at 94 Ningbo Road, suddenly received a telegram from the Suzhou head office last night, ordering the closure of the business from now on. The branch immediately issued a notice saying, "To announce the closure of business, this bank received a telegram from the head office, effective from the 6th, we will suspend business temporarily and will announce again later." A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Shanghai branch of the bank yesterday that at the end of last year, the fixed deposit was 158,631 yuan and 5 jiao, and the current deposit was 38,680 yuan and 6 jiao and 6 fen. The Shanghai branch suddenly received a call from the Suzhou head office at around 1:00 AM yesterday, ordering the closure of the business from the 6th. It is rumored that the Shanghai branch was unable to pay the bills on the 5th and asked the head office for help, which led to the forced closure of the business, but this is not true. In fact, the Shanghai branch cleared all the bills on the 5th and did not ask the head office for help. The head office's board meeting on the 5th resolved to close the business and telegraphed the Shanghai branch to comply. As for the settlement method, it must wait for the shareholders' meeting to decide.</p>

<h3>The Pavilion Buildings of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>The pavilion building can be said to be a unique building in Shanghai. Although some people say that some are not worthy of the name, because the pavilion is named, but it does not fly in fact. However, the pavilion building has nearly twenty years of history in Shanghai, and in terms of the current situation, as long as Shanghai exists for one day, the pavilion building will always follow and will not disappear, because the lovers of pavilion buildings are really not a few in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Although the status of the pavilion building is above the kitchen and below the drying platform, and it always opens windows to the north, with cold winters and hot summers as its characteristics, however, the pavilion building is not without its advantages. Its biggest advantage is silence. If the door is closed, it is completely isolated from the other neighbors in the same shikumen. Therefore, some people used to say that "at least half of those who hide beauties in golden houses in Shanghai prefer to use pavilion buildings as golden houses." Although this is a bit of an exaggeration, it is said that hiding beauties in pavilion buildings is indeed a wonderful way to prevent spring scenery from leaking out.</p>
<p>Don't look at the ordinary pavilion building, which is only about 100 square feet, and it is so small. In the pavilion buildings of Shanghai, there are full small families living everywhere. The rent of an ordinary pavilion building is always in the range of four or five yuan to seven or eight yuan, which is just enough for those with meager monthly income. Therefore, there are many new couples who have just formed small families and are spending their honeymoon in the pavilion buildings.</p>
<p>Many impoverished writers also use pavilion buildings as writing places, because in the middle of the night, the surroundings are obviously infinitely silent. There is no sound of mice gnawing things, no snoring from the neighbors, and no crying of children. At this time, it is a good time to pour out their hearts and write quickly in order to exchange for living expenses tomorrow.</p>
<p>But in recent years, in the pavilion buildings of Shanghai, some have rented to manufacture drugs, some have rented to harbor kidnappers, or rented to do other illegal activities, so the mystery of the pavilion buildings is becoming more and more great.</p>
<h3>In the Rice Paddy</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>The villagers have planted the rice seedlings well, so neatly, row by row, plant by plant, standing in the water, the rice seedlings are emerald green and lovely. Running outside the village, the view is endless. Although there are a few cotton and bean fields mixed in the middle, because they are also emerald green, they feel quite harmonious. Summer is originally a season of lush green fields, with willow shade at the roadside and reed marshes by the beach, lining a green wilderness.</p>
<p>People who go to the countryside for outings may feel a different kind of "rural scenery." Sitting on a privately owned or public long-distance bus, the springy leather cushions are soft and comfortable, and looking out the window at the vast rice paddies beside the highway, the gentle breeze blows the slender and weak rice seedlings, and the sun shines on the water surface, reflecting a silvery mirror-like luster. Frogs hide under the rice seedlings and sing songs of midsummer. It only increases the beauty of sight and sound, however, this kind of beauty is built on the hard work of the farmers.</p>
<p>The scenery of the rice paddy is indeed pleasant, but the farmers alone know the hardship of transplanting rice seedlings. Bare-chested and bending over, with their backs facing the sky, they are baked by the scorching sun, turning into a deep orange color, almost like the roasted pigs in the city. They either lie on the waterwheel to water the rice seedlings, or transplant rice seedlings in the field. The water is forced by the sunlight to emit water vapor, which熏s the face and mixes with sweat. How uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Even more uncomfortable are the leeches in the rice paddies. They have sharp heads and are best at maneuvering, shrinking and stretching in the mud, with an ugly and frightening appearance. The farmers have bare legs and feet, stepping in the paddy field, their legs buried in the mud. The leeches have a maneuvering object and use their sharp heads to drill straight into the flesh. Because at first they only feel numb and itchy, they don't pay attention. After they feel pain, most of the leech has already drilled in. They can't pull it out, and if they pull it hard, it will break inside. The leeches live by sucking blood in the muscles, and the poor farmers have to be exploited by these small insects.</p>
<p>There is a local method, it is said that only oil needs to be applied, and when half of the leech has drilled in, tapping the muscles with your hand will also make it retreat. I once saw a farmer's leg bitten by four or five leeches, and the blood was dripping. Therefore, during the rice transplanting season, people are afraid to go to the field barefoot. Only a few can afford "water shoes." But for the sake of life, there is no way. Urban women are fashionable in summer to expose their legs and bare feet, because they don't have to go to the rice paddies to be bitten by leeches. Compared, the bitterness and joy are naturally worlds apart.</p>

<h3>Another Letter to Rong'er (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Your brother Zheng has been ordered to go to Zhenjiang for military training since May 1st, making the home even more desolate. If Er was here, it wouldn't be like this. In the past two months, I have received more than twenty letters, detailing his life, saying that no matter how hard the work is, he will gladly go to it and dare not be lazy, and he often encourages himself to serve the country. Each letter is three or four pages long, like a lover writing a love letter, chattering endlessly, but never a word about Er. I suspected that he was indifferent to fraternal love, but it was not so. When I read his letter to your sister Ling, the pain and mourning were overflowing. I realized that the reason why he didn't mention Er in his letters to me was probably because he was afraid of rekindling my grief. During these two months, I went to Zhenjiang twice to visit, and I was relieved to see that your brother was as healthy as ever. According to both brothers, he has been dreaming of Er lately, as happy as in life. So, is Er also thinking of his brother so much that he goes to visit him from time to time? What I find difficult to bear is that I remember a year ago, Er also came to Zhenjiang to participate in the National Boy Scout Jamboree, showing his bravery and activity. But now he is sleeping under Lingyan, a dead man. Looking at the present and thinking of the past, how can I not be heartbroken!</p>
<p>In mid-May, the county's entire Boy Scout troop, as usual, held its annual camp. I still remember the day after last year's camp, I came to the public sports field with your mother and your younger siblings to see what Er was doing. At that time, Er was lying in the camp tent after dinner, lifting the curtain and looking like a duck, smiling. This scene is still vivid as yesterday. This time, when I saw the Boy Scouts marching into the field, I suddenly remembered the past, tears welled up in my eyes, and I lowered my head and walked around. Alas, alas, my heart is not stone, how can I bear to go through the sports field again?</p>
<p>Usually, your mother treats your seven brothers and sisters equally, never favoring one over another. Whenever there are snacks, she always divides them equally among you, like Chen Ping dividing meat, striving for fairness. The other day, I brought back cakes from Shanghai, and your mother was happy and still divided them into seven equal portions. Suddenly, she remembered that Er had passed away and could no longer enjoy this food, so she secretly shed tears for him. When Dragon Boat Festival came around again, your mother followed the custom of making zongzi, and she remembered that Er had always loved this food, but now he could no longer eat it. Unexpectedly, her heart ached and her hands trembled, and the rice in the basket fell down, almost stopping the process. Alas, Rong'er, all these trivial things, the reason why I don't mind being verbose and want to tell Er everything is that I want Er to reflect on his momentary recklessness, which caused his parents endless pain. How will he face his parents? If Er knows, will he also regret it?</p>
<p>Your uncle works on the Longhai Railway, and he has been unable to return home for more than ten years due to his busy schedule. Now, upon hearing of Er's death, he suddenly returned home at the beginning of the month, and he held my hand sadly, unable to say a word. More than ten years ago, Uncle came to Shanghai once, and Er was just learning to speak. Now he can't see Er grow up, but only stares at Er's portrait obsessively. Your uncle also said that in early March, about a week before Er's death, Er sent a letter to Xianyang to greet him. This was the first letter in more than ten years, and also Er's last letter, but he never mentioned it to me. Did Er know that his end was approaching, and wanted to leave a memento with your uncle?</p>
<p>Since I published the previous letter, letters of condolences have poured in from friends from all over the world, all saying that I should not dwell on mourning, so as not to make Er even more uneasy under the spring. Mr. Yu Kongwo of the Xinwenbao also wrote an article in the newspaper, advising me to shed fewer tears. Furthermore, Mr. Mai Gongsan, an old friend of mine from Shenbao for thirty years, sent a letter from Hanao, more than a thousand words, discussing Buddhism in detail, using repeated metaphors to relieve my grief. My dear friend Mr. Wang Yizhi, who is currently a guest in the Netherlands, also comforted me from thousands of miles away with a postal tube, and gave me a copy of "Bao'er's First Awakening" by the poet Aedon of his country, which was written to mourn his beloved son. His argument is that the death of our physical body is actually the awakening of the spirit. So, Er's closing his eyes today is probably the first time Er's spirit has awakened? Telling this to your mother comforted her greatly.</p>
<p>Alas, Rong'er! My pain over Er's death has already wasted thousands of words of ink, and I could have stopped here. But the above things must be made known to Er. This letter was written in late June, during my second visit to Zhenjiang to see your brother. I was constantly thinking of Er because of your brother, and I couldn't help but feel sad. In the lonely lamp of the guest house, I couldn't sleep at night, so I took out a pencil and wrote, stopping when my mind was exhausted. The next day, I finished it in the car, the tip of the pen was like drawing lotus silk, continuous and unbroken, unexpectedly exceeding two thousand words again. From now on, I will expect Er in my dreams, and I will no longer write letters to Er. I won't go on. Father's words to the close friends here. (Written on the hundredth day after Rong Jian's death)</p>
<p>Seasonal Fruit Column</p>
<h3>Ma Mountain Yangmei (Chinese Bayberry)</h3>
<p>— Ousi</p>
<p>Maji Mountain (or called Ma Mountain) in Wujin County has high peaks and ridges, surrounded by lakes on all sides, and the scenery is extremely beautiful. Recently, it has been developed into a scenic area by the county government. Ma Mountain Yangmei: Saying it will not feel unfamiliar. Not only is it cheap, but also its taste is exceptionally beautiful. Those who taste it for the first time truly have the feeling of "not letting go even if slapped in the face." Now is also the time when the trees are full of red makeup.</p>
<p>In recent years, many Yangmei trees have died. Because everyone sees that there is not much harvest, they gradually stop paying attention to it, and it looks like it is disappearing, especially the white one, commonly known as "Crystal Plum," is even rarer. At the same time, there are also many difficulties in transportation; therefore, it is impossible to taste it in places a little further away, and even if there is, it is not very fresh and delicious.</p>
<h3>Li Mountain Drunken Plum</h3>
<p>— Bō Guāng</p>
<p>Lijiaxiang in Changxing County, which belongs to the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, has quiet mountains and rivers, and the scenery is pleasant. There is a plain in the deep mountains and valleys, half of which is natural terrain, and half of which is built by artificial techniques. Houses are lined up one after another, and merchants converge, with tens of thousands of workers gathered and living there. It turns out to be a place of production of lime, stones, and stone powder. There are two stone mining companies, organized on a large scale.</p>
<p>Li Mountain in Lijiaxiang produces very famous Drunken Plums. The size of the Drunken Plum is a bit larger than a chicken egg, and the color is the same as a red rose. The plum skin is very thin. Tearing off some skin, you can put it on your lips and suck up the honey-sweet fruit juice, and there is a kind of fresh taste. It is a pity that the production is not much. People in Lijiaxiang specially pre-order from the producer and give them to the shareholders, bosses or relatives in Shanghai and Hangzhou. One yuan of legal tender can only buy eight. The shareholders and bosses in Shanghai and Hangzhou, after tasting the exotic flavor, entrust people in the company to pre-order every year, so they have priority.</p>
<p>A certain important person in Beijing heard of the famous Drunken Plum produced in this place, and turned to ask someone to taste the exotic flavor before giving it the elegant name "Amber Pearl." But I don't know what the intention is to name it Drunken Plum? Presumably its color is dark red, like a drunken face when people are drunk?</p>
<h3>Lintang Peach</h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>I haven't eaten Lintang peaches for many years. Now there is a possibility of re-tasting the old taste. Shouldn't I be happy that my appetite is not bad?</p>
<p>Lintang is a small village under the jurisdiction of Xiuning County, Anhui. The residents are good at planting, especially peaches. Where is the "Lintang Peach" famous? It turns out there are several advantages: 1. Sweet and crispy, 2. No worms, 3. Thin skin and small core, 4. Not many outer hairs. In short, the goodness of Lintang peaches is truly indescribable by my clumsy pen.</p>
<p>There are also many peach trees planted in our village, but the peaches that are produced are not as delicious as Lintang peaches, and they simply have a sour taste upon entering the mouth. For this reason, I once asked my cousin who lives in Lintang. According to him, when the peach tree grows to about the height of a person and has not yet bloomed, another kind of branch (such as plum, loquat, etc.) is wrapped with mud between the peach tree branches. The fruit that results will be sweet and delicious.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find traces of "Lintang Peach" in Shanghai, because it is too far away, and transportation is inconvenient, so it cannot supply the people of Shanghai like Baisha loquat. However, the waves of material civilization have already flown into our villages. Isn't the Beijing-Ganzhou Railway about to be completed? The virgin-like Lintang peach will surely be appreciated by the young masters of Shanghai. If this can be the case, it will be a small help to the residents of Lintang.</p>
<h3>Swapping the Nest, Bending the Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 14 (Wax Tears Pull Silk Curtains Bid Farewell to Good Dreams, Jade Face Moon Thins, Water Pavilion Mourns Remaining Glory)</p>
<p>Youmei said: I know you are in a bad mood. However, he, he, he shouldn't have. As Youmei spoke, she was pouring a cup of tea and bringing it to Menglan. She said it very casually. Menglan suddenly stood up, pressed the teacup with both hands, looked up at Youmei, and asked: Did he do something wrong? Youmei said: I saw a novel of his in a magazine. It wrote about a man who participated in the wedding ceremony of a confidant. At that time, a sharp knife was really cutting into his heart. However, at the banquet, he sang, played finger-guessing games, and toasted, seemingly extremely happy. So after returning home, he slept a great sleep with the help of wine, sleeping straight for three days before waking up. The story is very simple, but his description of the man's inner grief, while also being happy with people, that contradictory state of mind, was written really well. I, a person on the outside, couldn't help but shed two or three tears. While listening to him, Menglan's face changed, her eyes were fixed, and it seemed that tears were about to fall out. After he finished speaking, she immediately laughed, laughing as if very fiercely, throwing her head back and forth, messing up her hair. Then she took out a handkerchief to wipe her face, and rubbed her eyes twice, and smiled: You are also talking nonsense. A broad-minded person like you will listen to storytelling and cry, worrying about the ancients. And you have counted the tears yourself and there are only two or three, Youmei had already turned on the lights. Under the electric lights, they were not far apart from each other, and her eyes were already red, how could he not know? Her burst of laughter came too nonsensically and suddenly! Why like this, already understood in the heart. Because laughed: I am afraid that you will not be easy to digest after eating, especially lead you to laugh, is this not good? Menglan said: Okay, thank you very much for the kindness of my old friend. I have eaten and laughed, I should go. Saying, he flicked Youmei's hand and said: There are many things we want to say, but I have not said a word. You are my classmate for many years, and you know my temperament, so there is no need for me to say it. I know that I have let people down, but I have no choice. The moon is thin, there will be days to become round again, people are sick, old, can not go to find the lost youth again. I'm leaving, I can't help but say, excuse me for not expressing myself properly. Youmei knew that he was not speaking to himself, so he nodded a few times, and said in a low voice: I understand, if there is a chance, I will speak for you. Menglan said, what? Are you also waiting for an opportunity? Youmei also had Youmei's difficulties, how to talk to him well, just held his hand, shook it a few times only. (193)</p>
<h3>Occasional Notes of News</h3>
<p>— Yu Sansi</p>
<p>Benefit Oneself and Others</p>
<p>My residence is in the alley, this morning when I got up, I idly looked out the window, and accidentally saw two servants sweeping outside the door of the neighbor, and next to them was a housewife directing them, telling them to mix the Asian forest deodorant in the water and sprinkle it on the ground, and even sprinkled it at the door of her two neighbors. Her hygienic behavior is really able to benefit herself and others.</p>
<p>Curing Dampness</p>
<p>This kind of skin disease of "dampness" not only occurs on the feet, but can occur all over the body. A friend of mine named Wu had dampness on his neck, and a friend of mine named Xue had dampness on his hands. They both felt it was unsightly. After I introduced them to wash with "Asian Forest Sand," they both reported that they were cured, because my foot problem was also cured by washing with that kind of medicine.</p>

<h3>Shanghai and the Five Continents</h3>
<p>— Weizai</p>
<p>Shanghai is not only a metropolis in the East, but also an important commercial port on the five continents.</p>
<p>Now is the period of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and all sectors are holding grand celebrations to show their joy and encourage the future. This is really meaningful.</p>
<p>I remember last year, Shanghai had a grand scene, that is, the Wuzhou Pharmacy held its 30th anniversary and the completion ceremony of the new building, which was sensational and near and far. This impression is still engraved in people's minds.</p>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmacy produces various good medicines, sanitary products, and soaps, with excellent results and sales at home and abroad, and Shanghai can be considered its important source.</p>
<p>I sincerely wish Shanghai and Wuzhou a future with unlimited brightness.</p>
