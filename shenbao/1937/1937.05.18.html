<p>時評</p>
<h3>防止銅鐵出口</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>最近數月來。由於各國猛烈擴充軍備的影響。與軍火工業有關的各種金屬。如鋼鐵銅鉛等。價格頓見飛漲。前月美國鋼鐵工業中心辟茲堡消息。碎鋼的價格。已達每噸二一•二五美金。為一九二五年以來的最高紀録。在這種情况之下。英日等國均已取消鋼鐵的入口稅。德國也於本月一日起。頒布關於鋼鐵用途的新法。對於這種軍火的重要原料的爭取。現在顯然已經成為列强備戰程序中的一個重要的步驟了。</p>
<p>這種競奪軍火原料的趨向。在我國也已發生了影響。最近數月來。我們於各地消息中間。發見了兩種特殊的事件。一為某國浪人的走私。以前是把他們不納關稅的私貨。侵入我國。現在則又把我國的銅元大批收買。私運出去。另一種事件則是各地常有奸商地痞秘密收買廢鐵。售於某國浪人這兩種情形表示某國因為銅鐵等軍火原料的缺乏又不得不向我國這方面着眼。他們甚至不惜破壞我們的幣制與市面的安定來滿足他們備戰的需要了。</p>
<p>一般的比較起來。在目前列强中間。日本確是最缺少鋼鐵的一國。上月三日同盟社消息。日本因為感到鋼鐵的需要。自四月十日起。已决定免去鐵的入口稅兩年。在上月二十日。大阪商會對於巴西向日本定購的、千萬圓鐵軌與機器。也因為鐵料的空前的缺乏。不得不加以拒絕。據統計。本年度日本所需鋼鐵。約為四•六五○•○○○噸。其中用於政府事業如鐵道及其他公共建築白。只有一○○•○○○噸。餘下的都用於軍火工業方面。由於這樣巨大的需要。又由於世界鋼鐵市場價格的暴漲。他們為了經濟上的關係。自然要別尋蹊徑來補救那種不足了。</p>
<p>不過就我們本身的利害講。銅元以及廢鋼舊鐵的私運出口。前者足以擾亂我們金融的安定。後者更可以直接危害我們國防的力量。民間的銅鐵原料。乃是一個國家的工業國力的一部分。在戰爭爆發時候。軍火的外來接濟易受阻碍。則民間的軍火原料的徵發。卽為增强國防力的一種方法。我們對於這種關係於國防安全的重要原料不能不加意防護。使它們不致私漏出口。落入侵略者的手中。</p>
<p>關於防止銅鐵走私出口的辦法。一方面要靠政府的法令力量。另一方面也要靠民間自發的愛國的熱忱。目前我們銅鐵私漏出外的主要地方。為天津•上海•厦門等處。這些地方為某國浪人麕集之所。但我國必須以嚴厲的法令。防止貧利的奸商與這些浪人接洽交易。此外在內地各處則當盡量激發商人愛國的熱情。使他們知道銅鐵這種原料與國防的關係。應該相互勉勵與監視。防止這些原料落入他人的手中。自然這兩點也只是原則上的意見。關於更具體的防範辦法。應該由政府當局與民間各方面仔細的商酌。加以决定的。</p>

<p>［東京］地方長官會議今晨在首相官邸開幕、佐蘇外相之訓辭要旨如下、帝國政府之根本外交方針、在依據帝國之國是、卽本國際正義、謀東亞之安定與萬邦共榮之實現、遂行舉國一致之外交政策、圖國際關係之調整與國運之伸長、此當為諸君所熟知也、余信當此世界情勢依然未能安定之時、欲改善並提高帝國之國際地位、則對國際全局之統合的工作、尤如使日滿兩國之不可分關係愈臻强固、從而調整對華對蘇之關係、實屬必要、然中日關係、客歲不詳事件續發、為改善兩國國交所必要之各懸案之解决、仍在停頓狀態之下、誠為遺憾、近來中國方面、因國家意識之抬頭、“一致抗日”之主張、有已成為一種流行語之觀、國民政府之向中國統一之途前進、如地方致權之中央化、幣制改革後之財政整理、以外國資本促進各種建設事業等、卽徵諸西南問題之解决、綏遠西安事件之經緯等、亦不得不謂為一不容忽視之事象、中國之抗日空氣、似頗有由誤解帝國對華有侵略的意圖而發生之處、然帝國政府、則確乎全無此種意思、今後仍得使中國方面徹底了解此眞意努力於中日國交之改善、又鑑於中國方面如上之情勢、今後之方針、將先使民間之接觸頻繁化、以圖融和兩國民間之感情、同時促進以中日提携為主眼之文化的經濟的工作、藉以兩國大衆為基礎之密切的經濟上相互依存關係之樹立、漸次謀兩國國交之調整、蘇聯自明年起、將更樹立第三次五年計劃、一方重視工業之繼績的發展與國民交化之提高、同時努力於軍備之增强、至於與帝國有重要關係之遠東蘇領之現狀、則該方面之軍備充實與各種軍需工業之建設、有方興未艾之觀、他方面、蘇聯政府於去年十二月制定新憲法、施行所謂民主的各制度、徵諸去年八月及本年一月之所謂反革命陰謀審判事件、可知蘇聯內政、實相當複雜、帝國政府、一方儘可能之內除去兩國間不必要之摩擦、圖解决兩國間之縣案、如漁業條約問題、北樺太權利關係問題、滿蘇國境委員會問題等、努力使彼此關係走入常軌、</p>

<p>日德關係、已於去年十一月成立日德防共協定、蓋帝國政府由擁護國體並確保東亞和平之見地、對於共產主義運動、堅持其確固之方針、因共產國際公然以日本德意志為目標、實施其赤化工作、遂認有講求國際的防衛措置之必要、因此、遂與立塲與我國相同之德國成立共同防衛之協定、政府期望於今後充分活用該協定、以收效果、</p>
<p>我國對外貿易額、最近逐年增加、昨年並示五十五億元之新紀錄、本年上半年、預料亦將伸張、然各國對於貿易設立各種限制、尢其對於本國商品之伸展、依然保持警戒的態度、故欲維持並增進我國之通商與貿易、對於各外國對本國商品之防遏處置、實有講求臨機的適當手段之必要、關於此點、今日世界各地、大小案件績出、我國駐外官憲、為此所辦之折衝、有應接不暇之勢、現我國與英屬印度•緬甸•荷屬東印度•以及澳洲等、曾費去數個月之光陰、舉行通商交涉、現則均已告圓滿解决矣、與士耳其•意大利•暹羅•中美•南美諸國、目下均在進行通商交涉中、（十七日同盟電）</p>

<h3>記馬與丹君</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>自政府努力於國內之建設，而器械之輸入與年俱增。蓋欲謀生產事業之增加，不得不儘量購置舶來之器械，此“善事”必先“利器”之主張，此固言建設者之所同然者也。顧吾以為購買外貨，以資生產，生產之效未見，而利權之溢已彰：究非根本建設之道。根本建設之道，其在於造就製造之人才乎？蓋器械之製造，一日原料，二日人才，中國不乏原料，而少人才；委貨於地，而乞憐於人，何如自造自用，予取予求之為便乎？</p>
<p>醫學為科學之結晶，自近世電療之術明，而器械之使用愈廣。然電療器械，悉為舶來，每歲漏巵，於茲為甚。夫以活人之具，而取之於人，一旦來源斷絕，則束手無方，其為危險，不獨資金之外流而已。吾嘗深憂隱盧於此種器械製造人才之缺乏，近乃得馬君與丹焉。馬君與丹者震旦醫學院之高材生也。往余承乏該校敎席，卽見君聰頴好學，有異常人。習醫之餘，獨孜孜於電器製造之工作，凡電療器械，罔不究心。始嘗以所手製之電烙器多架分贈同學，旣則感於電療器械之應用，以長短波透熱機為最廣，開業醫師，幾於人手一具。而舶來貨品，價值奇昻，體積龐大，尤艱携帶。乃專心研究，銳意改良，其所製造，成本低廉，僅半外貨，式樣玲巧，不逾手篋，然其發熱之力，不因體積而稍輕，電割電凝，不减舶來之功用。又可利用靜電，不限交流，旣可携往出診之病家，復可用於缺乏電燈設備之內地，信可謂妙用通神神明於技者矣！君將以今厦畢業，余常勸君用其全力以為大規模之製造。表而出之，或亦言醫事設建之醫家所宜留意者歟？</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>抱子投河</h3>
<p>— 于高</p>
<p>社會上的悲劇，是經常在發生着的。在全國各地的大小角落裏，幾無日無刻，不有多少生命，在被毁滅和死亡。然而因為他們這些人的存在，是從來就被遺忘着的，所以也喚不起他人的注意。四川的災民，每日都有成千上萬的人在餓死，住在上海的人，還可以“眼不看為凈”，仍然度着紙醉金迷的生活，也就是這個原因。</p>
<p>但原因尚不止此。中國這社會，是一向就不知道尊重人底生命的。從前的專制皇帝，可以把他的臣下，用着大辟，腰斬，這些非人道的酷刑來處死。流賊張獻忠的入蜀，共殺了好幾百萬人。這事實，到現在談起來還不免呌人有些心顫。然而就是文明的現代，不也有大批的優秀靑年，在像受難的羔羊似的，被牽入可怕的屠塲中去麼？起初，這鮮艷的血痕，還可以引起人的注意，久而久之，這悲劇的印象，給人的回數太多了，影子就漸漸的淡起來。據說，這也不是有意的，而乃有其生理上的原因。人的感覺對於同一種外在的現象，刺激的次數太多，反應就漸漸的麻木。如果要想牠恢復的話，那就只有更加强牠的刺激。例如這社會上的自殺者，每日多到四五起，報紙把這些不幸者的消息，拚排在一塊兒，一般人看得過於慣常了，也就漠然視之。但如果要引起他們注意的話，也不是沒有法子，那就是自殺者的求死手段，一定要慘烈的異常，用牠的對自身過度的殘害，來喚起人們尋常的感覺。如從前有人從大世界的三層樓上，携着妻兒數口，一齊從高處跳下，血色殷紅，屍體狼籍，一時也引起人們的注意，各報均紛紛為文以評之，認為是一個很嚴重的社會問題。然而這在死者的犧牲，却又是多麼驚人的巨大呵！</p>
<p>偶然看見各報上均載有這麼一條新聞：“粵籍婦人錢祝氏，育有一子，年祇二齡，乃夫係充小工，近以經濟斷絕，生活困難，伊遂頓起厭世之念，昨日上午十時許抱子至沿蘇州河江西路橋畔，乘人不備，縱身投河，幸經人救起，未遭滅頂”。</p>
<p>為經濟困迫，而抱子投河之事，在目前這社會上，已成為習見不鮮，再尋常不過的事了。然就在這極尋常的背後，却存在着極大的悲劇，人們是不會想到的。是的！誰呌牠太尋常得引不起人的注意了呢？</p>
<h3>生之哀感</h3>
<p>— 田舍</p>
<p>因為路徑關係，每晨從家裏出來幹活兒，免不了要經過那煩囂擁擠，而又潮濕泥濘的菜市，但這些還能忍受過去，只要走完那地帶也就清靜了。最使我難以忍受，而深深印刻腦海不易淡忘的，莫過於一種死的刺激：那鷄鴨店門口的大缸，大缸裏滿滿赭色的血水，水面浮起了鷄鴨殘折的羽毛，光滑潔白的鷄鴨的屍體，成批的倒掛在鐵鈎上，頸項被吊得那麼長，被割的裂縫裏還有淡淡的血水滲出。這些可慘的生物的血液已凝給成塊，被浸在提桶裏出售，牠們的臟腑已全部挖出，堆積在篾匾裏供人作下酒物。</p>
<p>還有那豬肉舖裏，夥計們不知為要表示他們的牲口新鮮呢，還是像要有意紛我些死的恐怖？每天總有那麼一顆血淋淋的猪頭，掛在當門的柱槓上，有時眼睛睜的很大，似乎死不瞑目，有時眼皮合攏，猶顯出臨死時的可憐相，還有一隻或兩隻密佈微絲血管的猪肺，那氣管裂斷的地方湧着白沬，一望而知，那肺是健康的，有初期肺病嫌疑的我看到了這情形，頓時感覺着呼吸不利，胸部似乎發生隱痛。由於一剎間神經的感覺：像是自己的肺給掛出來了，然而自己的肺是不健康的呵。這樣，我便低下頭來。</p>
<p>自己曾一度患過劇烈的咳嗽吐血症，茹素的姑母為着愛我過切吧，亦會殘忍地告訴我一個“以猪肺補人肺”的單方。把剛殺出胸膛的猪肺趁熱在氣管裏塞進一二十顆川貝母，煮爛切碎淡食，據說極有效騐。可是我終於感謝她一番好意而並未依法泡製。像這種“取物之長補人之短”，跡近自私的單方，確聽到過不少，如腦弱健忘的吃猪腦，腎虧腰痠的吃猪腰子，脚力不好的吃蹄筋，甲魚龜版滋陰，童子鷄補虛損，諸如此類不可思議的治病“神方”，是益是害？還在不可知之數，可是首先倒霉遭殺戮的，却是那些和人類一樣有生命，有知覺的牲畜們。前些時，曾有過“活煮嬰孩”，“吮吸童精”，駭人聽聞的事，這又該是“進步”的“取人之長補己之短”的靈方吧？但是某種人類的殘酷性，却於此益顯了。</p>
<p>豐子愷先生的“護生畫集”是我時常重複翻閱的書籍中的一冊，每幅畫面雖祇那麼簡潔地寥寥幾筆，沒有襯托，沒有誇張，可是對於生物之命運，和一種死的情狀的刺激感，已深深地挑引起我內心的悲哀。畫面所表演的，和我在菜市上所目覩的一樣：一批掛在鐵鈎上的鴨，題字為“陳屍”，一顆血淋淋的猪頭，題字為“號令”，前者使我想起了“大火”“播車”“覆舟”“飢饉”，這些發生於人類自身的慘劇，後者又使我想起了囚犯被斬决後，頭顱掛在城鬥口號令示衆的恐怖狀。人類正和其他生物同樣地有遭受至乖戾的殺機的可能。</p>
<p>然而，死於刀刃，死於水火，死於災禍，還是有形的，有形，猶可博得一點口頭或筆底的同情，祇是被不斷地磨折於苦難生活之下，出賣汗血以外，還得把脂膏任人吮吸的一羣，是慢慢地乾枯，慢慢地死去的，沒有一絲創痕可尋，雖然未死之前，也許有過疲乏和病痛，他們仍在疲乏和病痛中，未曾放棄工作，為“生”而掙扎，掙扎的結果却不免於一死”，生之意義究竟在那裏呢？從牲畜到一部份人類，以及人類中的自己，是同樣地有着生之哀感的吧。</p>

<h3>夜行</h3>
<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>——“天堂”零感之一</p>
<p>把呢帽拉得低到齊眼眉，我開始用急驟的步伐走過石橋。一連落了五天的綿綿的春雨還在繼續着。街上泥濘得使人隨時有滑跌的機會。……</p>
<p>“你應當好好休養一下才對呢，這樣微風斜雨的黑夜，你就在這里歇息一晚不好麼？”</p>
<p>朋友底關懷的慰語似乎又在耳邊響着了。</p>
<p>我拒絕了他底好意。—對於這一種嬌貴的想念，我一向就很少掛慮過的。我不知道把身體養得肥白有什麼用處。找衹懂得愛我底生活，和我底工作。</p>
<p>“不，讓我在雨中淋一下吧，我也想學楊柳那樣的抽出些嫩綠的新芽。—春天了呢。”</p>
<p>“春天？……”</p>
<p>朋友沈迷在訝異的驚疑的蠱惑中了。他用雙手掩住臉孔太息起來。……</p>
<p>這樣，悄悄地走了出去，悄悄地，在泥濘的雨夜里走着我底道路了•</p>
<p>沿着河邊，緊密地擠着幾條小艇和一排一排的竹筏。黑色的透明的河水偸偸地在船舷邊下刷過。不知道是什麼東西把竹筏札得吱吱地作響。</p>
<p>夜航船底嘩喇喇的擊水聲漸漸遠去。但寂寞却給喁喁的私語和低低的太息代替了。</p>
<p>河岸上，堆着小丘似的碎石，竹枝，木村，和一綑細的柴，像有什麼可怕的東西蹲在它們底後面，隨時會跳出來抓人似的。有一個傴僂的人影，捉了一盞暗微而且細小的燈，從船艙里爬出來，故意地裝着假咳。……</p>
<p>雨水從帽沿上掛下來，我讓它躺在我底臉頰上。我底衫子是潮濕的，我底脚步現在是遲滯的，疲倦的。</p>
<p>我雖然知道咬緊牙關活下去，一直到那不是人力所能挽回的死亡底末日。但，太悠長的無望的灰色日子，幾乎使我連發怒的本能都忘記了。</p>
<p>我底生活把我底麻木的身體安置在一個被稱為“天堂”的小縣城中，五個月過去了。—平淡得像一碗沒鹽的靑菜那麼的帶點苦澀味的五個月啊。</p>
<p>起始，我還孩子氣地用掏金者一樣的熱情和謹愼，在每個角落里，找尋着“天堂”底名稱底來由。也許那里邊會找出些使我笑悅底種子吧。可是，這破落戶似的天堂已經變了。我從未有一次滿足地說：</p>
<p>“那𦆵是天堂呀。”</p>
<p>每天，一家小型報館，用兩大張的紙，記載着天堂底消息。</p>
<p>—天堂麼？地獄麼？</p>
<p>這樣疑惑决不是無因的。—</p>
<p>充塞滿紙的是：男女底糾紛，擯棄和姦淫等等底控訴；跋扈的湖匪底驚人的行動，暗殺，搶刧，帮架；催租，風潮，民警底衝突，流血；烟犯；私娼；……</p>
<p>一個旅行記者用俏皮的筆調寫的通訊里說：“我看到過天堂里底一切，不過我很抱歉地請你們原諒。恕我不能在‘老’和‘古舊’之外還能告訴一些什麼了。”</p>
<p>天堂底日子是像一條遲滯而污濁的河似的流過去，春天。正是反映着艷麗的陽光的油質那樣地，在污黑的河面上浮泛着吧了。</p>
<p>雨水把衫子濕透了，不時地，寒冷使我發抖，水珠從帽沿躺到臉上，冉跟着身體而由褲管滴落到地上。</p>
<p>黑的夜，冷的雨，無涯的寂寞與憂愁，但，我相信我底心是溫暖的。—我渴望着晴朗而明媚的春天。</p>
<h3>夜之零落章</h3>
<p>— 王仁東</p>
<p>窗</p>
<p>夜，無邊的沉默。</p>
<p>燈燄顫搖：一朶抑鬱底花。然而周遭底黑夜，濃密地瀰漫——把它網起了；不許開放。如鬼火凍住有深谷里。如垂死的螢火底無力的沉默的碧綠。如詩句在抑鬱者底心里。</p>
<p>木格窗沒有糊紙：夜風在蕭蕭。</p>
<p>窗外有一株楓樹，在夜風里蕭蕭。記憶告訴我：牠有過血紅的葉子。然而，在夜里變鳥黑了。雖然花了的眼睛曾見到一些像瘋狗底紅眼珠，但馬上消失了，消失了。</p>
<p>只有無邊的黑夜，無邊的沉默。</p>
<p>燈燄把父親和我底影子，拉長了貼在空虛的牆壁上。如一幅剪影。</p>
<p>父親拱着手，低着頭，在沉默地坐着。</p>
<p>偶爾有一聲深長的嘆息——當他抬起頭，看到窗外底沉默的時候。</p>
<p>無邊的抑鬱，疲乏他了。</p>
<p>我也沉默：然而一隻隻惡夢，爬着。</p>
<p>雖然抑鬱也使我窒息，但有一串很多很長的寂寞的慘笑，多次想從我的內心偸偸地爬出來。</p>
<p>花了眼睛以後，瘋狗底紅眼珠也消失了。</p>
<p>在屋里，在窗外：沉默在濃密地緊縮。</p>
<p>燈燄凍住。</p>
<p>剩下的是一塊沉重的黑夜。</p>
<p>鬼火</p>
<p>（鬼火如開在抑鬱的黑夜里底燈燄）</p>
<p>黑夜。</p>
<p>在瘦幹子的樹下，我們幾個看鬼火的背着山坡在沉默地坐着。</p>
<p>我們在等待碧魚的鬼火，出現在那遼遠的深黑的叢林里。</p>
<p>黑夜和恐怖揑成了一片。</p>
<p>（恐佈會爬上看鬼火的心上，然而却不能遮住看鬼火的眼睛。）</p>
<p>我的身旁是一塊石碑：我倚着牠，可以躱去一些兒尖風。牠使我底兩手冰冷。如我摸着一塊死寂的心。但，手放在牠上面久了，傳與了牠內在底狂熱。</p>
<p>同來的幾個孩子，沉默地擠在我的身旁，黑夜和恐怖也把我們揑成了一片</p>
<p>我們有一顆共同的期待。</p>
<p>在那遼遠：是一片更深沉的黑色。從記憶里我們知道那一方墳墓多。——墳墓多的地方，鬼火多。</p>
<p>從那纍纍的墳墓的地方，將出現我們所期待的鬼火。</p>
<p>瘦幹子的樹，像一個沉默的瞭望的哨兵。當夜風來時，牠蕭蕭地擺着：牠攪動黑夜和恐怖揑成的一片沉寂。——這是警告。</p>
<p>我們更擠得緊些。</p>

<h3>Tragedy in Hong Kong: Japanese Ferry Steamboat Explodes</h3>
<p>Japanese Passengers Had Just Arrived in Hong Kong by Ship; All 53 Perish; Explosion Shakes Entire City, Limbs Fly</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Osaka Company's "Peking Maru" arrived in Hong Kong at 8 PM on the 17th from Japan. Fifty-three Japanese passengers boarded the ferry "Tomishima Maru" to disembark. As the ferry was mooring at Queen's Pier, the steamboat exploded, shattering the entire vessel. More than sixty crew members and passengers were killed, including all fifty-three Japanese passengers from the large Japanese ship. Seven were seriously injured, and five were slightly injured. Severed limbs and mangled remains flew high into the air, some landing on the shore and rooftops. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The "Rio de Janeiro Maru," en route to South America, arrived in port today carrying many Japanese passengers. The Osaka Shosen Kaisha (Osaka Merchant Shipping Co.) dispatched the ferry "To Maru" to take them to the city for sightseeing. The ferry was moored at Queen's Pier, and as the passengers were returning to the ship, and just after they boarded the ferry, a boiler explosion occurred. All fifty-odd passengers and approximately ten employees of the shipping company perished. Limbs were scattered, and bodies flew through the air. The tragic scene was unbearable to witness. It is also reported that many people in the vicinity of the tragedy were injured. The Japanese Consul in Hong Kong, Okamoto, has invited representatives from the shipping company to investigate the details. Further reports will follow. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] A sudden, massive explosion occurred here, shaking the entire waterfront. Dismembered limbs are scattered everywhere, causing considerable panic among the public. It is now believed to have been caused by a boiler explosion on a small boat belonging to the Osaka Shosen Kaisha. At least dozens of Chinese and Japanese people are among the casualties. (Reuters Dispatch, 17th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Eighteen Bodies Recovered</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] Tonight, as the Osaka Shosen Kaisha's small ferry "Tomishima Maru" was carrying passengers from the Japanese mail ship "Rio de Janeiro Maru" and about to leave Queen's Pier, the steamboat suddenly exploded. The sound was deafening, shaking the entire waterfront. At the time of the disaster, forty-seven Japanese were either on the ferry or standing on the steps of the pier. It is now known that twenty people died, twelve were injured and taken to the hospital, and thirteen are missing. The six Chinese sailors on the ferry were all blown to pieces. Passersby were also among the dead and injured. After the disaster, the waterfront and pier were filled with chaotic and indescribable noise. A Reuters reporter witnessed dismembered limbs scattered everywhere. The head and body of one Japanese woman were separated, with the head landing on the second-floor balcony of the Hong Kong Club. A corpse fell on the roof of the Taikoo Company and outside the Reuters news agency's main entrance. Tonight, police boats are using searchlights to scour the sea, and eighteen bodies have been recovered so far. However, the exact number of dead and injured cannot be confirmed before dawn. The Osaka Shosen Kaisha and the police are currently examining the bodies in the hope of identifying them. Initially, it was thought that Westerners must have been among the victims, as Queen's Pier is only a short distance from the Star Ferry from Kowloon. However, it has now been confirmed that no Westerners are among the dead and injured. (Reuters Dispatch, 17th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] At 8 PM on the 17th, as an Osaka small ferry, "Tomishima Maru," approached Queen's Pier, its steam pipe suddenly exploded, shattering the entire vessel.

<h3>Continued Trial of Liu Luhyin Case in Wuchang District Court</h3>
<p>Questioning of Five Suspects in the Yang Assassination Case; Liu's Defense Statement Outlines Seven Key Points</p>
<p>[Hankou] Key Points of Liu Luhyin's Defense Statement: 1. Being elected as a standing committee member of the People's Movement Association has no connection with the assassination. 2. Approving the budget for the proposed plan is not evidence of instigation. 3. The indictment accusing him of being an instigator is a misinterpretation of the law. 4. The judgment of disrupting public order has no basis in fact. 5. All the stipulations in the indictment are arbitrary and dogmatic. 6. Reliance on co-defendants' testimonies is proof of innocence. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] The Wuchang District Court continued questioning five suspects in the Yang assassination case on the 17th: Cao Bingrong, Yang Qixin, Li Qunjian, Wen Maoguan, and Nie Jingquan.

When the reporter was in court, he heard the presiding judge of the court state that there were plans to hold a second investigative hearing. After the investigation is completed, a public trial will be held. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Liu Luhyin submitted a defense statement refuting the charges of joint instigation to murder and disrupting public order, listing seven reasons. The original text is approximately three thousand words. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] The Wuchang District Court continued the investigative hearing in the First Tribunal at 9 AM on the 17th, examining the defendants in the assassination of Yang Yongtai. Court security was the same as the previous day, and the public gallery was full. The court officials present were the same as before. At 9:05 AM, Cao Bingrong was brought in for questioning first, and he completely overturned his previous testimonies given during the investigation by the Capital Police Department, the Wuhan Pacification Headquarters, and the Wuchang District Court. Next, Yang Qixin, Li Qunjian, Wen Maoguan, and Nie Jingquan were questioned, and their testimonies were extremely evasive. The court adjourned at noon. Also, Yang Yongtai's family filed a private lawsuit with the District Court, demanding that the defendants Liu Luhyin, Cheng Xiechao, Gong Bozhou, Cao Bingrong, Yang Xiaoming, and Fan Qishu bear the cost of supporting Yang's children and pay consolation money, totaling 218,560 yuan.

<h3>Supervisory Official Proposes Impeachment Due to Chen Juesheng's Non-Compliance with Anti-Smuggling Order</h3>
<p>Supervisory Yuan Has Delivered for Review and Will Immediately Transfer for Disciplinary Action</p>
<p>[Nanjing] In recent years, smuggling has been rampant everywhere, significantly impacting national treasury revenue. The government has repeatedly issued orders to provincial and municipal governments and all land and sea transportation agencies to intensify efforts to combat smuggling. However, according to reports, Chen Juesheng, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, has failed to comply with orders and has refused to allow customs officers to exercise their authority. The rampant smuggling in North China may be due to this. Zhou Lisheng, the Hebei Supervisory Official of the Supervisory Yuan, conducted a thorough investigation and recently submitted the confirmed facts to the Yuan for impeachment. It is reported that the Supervisory Yuan has delivered it for review and will immediately transfer it for disciplinary action. It is also reported that there have been cases of stealing and selling state-owned land and large quantities of steel in North China. The Supervisory Yuan is reportedly paying close attention and is sending personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Essentials of Wartime Engineering</h3>
<p>– Translated by Shen Yi</p>

After Chairman Zhang Ji of the Central Committee led the ceremony, he delivered an impromptu report on "The Party History Archives and Social Education," stating that the Central Party History Committee was established in 1930. Today, the collection and preservation of party history materials has only taken shape. It is not possible to achieve perfection overnight. As for the display of historical materials, it is also one of the main undertakings of the Committee. The Party History Archives was established on Double Tenth Day last year. Seven days have passed since its opening. According to statistics, the number of visitors since the opening has reached 15,672, with an average of more than 700 visitors per day. It can be seen that the attention of the general public to the history of our party has gradually become widespread. Moreover, most of the visitors are from schools, troops, police, and other groups. Therefore, the Party History Archives is not only a guidance institution for school education and social education, but also has a particularly close relationship with the promotion of social education. Therefore, since the opening of the Party History Archives, it has had the following effects on society: ① Promoting the historical spirit of our party and strengthening the public's understanding of the party. ② Inspiring the revolutionary emotions of the Chinese people and strengthening the determination to revive the nation. ③ Arousing the interest of people inside and outside the party in studying party history. ④ Giving spiritual comfort to veteran comrades and the families of martyrs. In summary, the display of party history is indeed in greater need of widespread attention. In the future, or within the possible scope, various historical materials will be photocopied and made into models for distribution and display in various places, or for touring exhibitions, so that they can be extended from the central government to the whole country, and help promote the education of party history, and the effect will be even more significant. At present, the Committee still feels that the materials are not rich enough, and all comrades in the party must work together to enrich the content. After Zhang finished speaking, the ceremony was completed. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he spoke on "How to Commemorate the Revolutionary May," first stating that there are many commemorative days in May. From the commemorative days, it can be seen that the broad masses of our people have a general awareness that is very different from the sluggish situation of fifty years ago. This is because various movements can stimulate the feelings of the entire nation and awaken every citizen to the close connection between themselves and the interests of the nation and the country. Moreover, this spirit has not only created a new era in the history of the Chinese people's movement, but also can influence the world. People all over the world have a deeper understanding of the Chinese nation and feel that it cannot be easily insulted. Although there are also places where we have suffered losses on the surface, in reality, the spiritual gains are very great, and the international status has been raised a lot invisibly. Therefore, May has a significant meaning in the history of our country's revolution. Next, the commemorative significance of "May 1st," "May 4th," "May 3rd," "May 5th," "May 9th," and "May 30th" were explained separately. Finally, it was said that when we hold various commemorations, on the one hand, we feel that the revolutionary significance of the past people's movement is rich and important, and can never be forgotten. On the other hand, we should pay more attention to the direction of our future efforts, so that we will not betray the profound meaning of the various commemorations in May.

<h3>Preventing the Export of Copper and Iron</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In recent months, due to the impact of the rapid expansion of armaments by various countries, the prices of various metals related to the arms industry, such as steel, copper, and lead, have soared. Last month, news from Pittsburgh, the center of the American steel industry, reported that the price of scrap steel had reached US$21.25 per ton, the highest record since 1925. Under these circumstances, countries such as Britain and Japan have abolished import tariffs on steel. Germany also promulgated new laws on the use of steel on the 1st of this month. The competition for these important raw materials for armaments has now clearly become an important step in the armament process of the great powers.</p>
<p>This trend of competing for raw materials for armaments has also had an impact on our country. In recent months, we have discovered two special events in news from various places. One is the smuggling by Japanese ronin. In the past, they smuggled their duty-free goods into our country. Now, they are buying up large quantities of our copper coins and smuggling them out. The other event is that unscrupulous merchants and local bullies often secretly buy scrap iron in various places and sell it to Japanese ronin. These two situations indicate that a certain country is lacking raw materials for armaments such as copper and iron and has to focus on our country. They are even willing to disrupt our currency system and market stability to meet their armament needs.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, among the current great powers, Japan is indeed the country that lacks steel the most. According to a Domei News Agency report on the 3rd of last month, Japan, feeling the need for steel, decided to exempt iron from import tariffs for two years, starting on April 10th. On the 20th of last month, the Osaka Chamber of Commerce had to reject Brazil's order to Japan for 10 million yuan worth of rails and machinery due to the unprecedented shortage of iron materials. According to statistics, Japan needs approximately 4,650,000 tons of steel this year. Of this, only 100,000 tons are used for government projects such as railways and other public buildings. The rest is used for the arms industry. Due to such huge needs and the soaring prices in the world steel market, they naturally have to find other ways to remedy the shortage for economic reasons.</p>
<p>However, from our own interests, the smuggling of copper coins and scrap steel for export, the former is enough to disrupt the stability of our finance, and the latter can directly endanger the strength of our national defense. The copper and iron raw materials of the people are part of a country's industrial power. When war breaks out, external assistance for armaments is easily hindered. The conscription of civilian armaments raw materials is a way to enhance national defense. We must pay attention to protecting these important raw materials related to national defense security so that they are not smuggled out and fall into the hands of invaders.</p>
<p>Regarding measures to prevent the smuggling of copper and iron exports, on the one hand, it is necessary to rely on the power of government decrees, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to rely on the people's spontaneous patriotic enthusiasm. At present, the main places where our copper and iron are smuggled out are Tianjin, Shanghai, Xiamen, and other places. These places are where Japanese ronin gather. However, our country must use strict laws to prevent profiteering merchants from contacting and trading with these ronin. In addition, in various inland areas, we should try our best to arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of merchants, so that they know the relationship between raw materials such as copper and iron and national defense. They should encourage and monitor each other to prevent these raw materials from falling into the hands of others. Naturally, these two points are only opinions in principle. More specific prevention measures should be carefully discussed and decided by the government authorities and various sectors of the people.</p>
<h3>Anglo-German Talks Near, New Developments in the European Situation</h3>
<p>Preparations for the Western European Pact and Germany's Return to the League of Nations; International Conference to be Convened by Authorities in the Short Term for Discussion</p>
<p>[London] After German Defense Minister General von Blomberg held talks with British Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Eden, etc., various newspapers here have commented on them, all believing that the international atmosphere has tended to ease. Regarding the establishment of a pact by Western European countries, and even the issue of Germany's return to the League of Nations, preparations have been made, and it is hoped that an international conference will be convened in the short term for discussion. The Daily Express reported that Britain and Germany could reach an agreement in the short term. Preliminary talks are still being conducted through diplomatic channels, so that the World Economic Conference can be convened by the end of this year or in the spring of next year. The Daily Mail reported that the British government had proposed that European countries should publish their military budgets in detail, so that the secrets of each country's military preparations could be exposed. The News Chronicle reported that important talks between the countries concerned are not far away, and the preliminary result may be that Germany agrees to establish a new pact based on the old Locarno Treaty, and that Britain and Italy will guarantee it. "As for the mutual assistance pact between France and the Soviet Union, it is not necessarily hostile to any country, and Germany can also sign to join it, and this should be clarified again," it said. (Central News Agency 17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Diplomatic circles today reported that German leader Hitler has drafted a plan for a Western European pact, stipulating that Britain, France, Belgium, and Germany will guarantee each other for fifteen years. It is reported that this plan is the result of the recent talks between German Defense Minister General von Blomberg and the British authorities. According to news from Paris, a joint declaration guaranteeing the security of Central Europe by Britain and France will be issued within a few days. It is reported that its content will restate the guarantee of the territorial integrity of the countries in the Danube River Basin, and its purpose is to prevent the merger of Germany and Austria and the cooperation between Germany and Italy to promote the strength of the Austrian Fascist Party. However, British officials believe that this is an atmosphere released by Parisians, and the British do not know about this declaration. (16th National Dispatch)</p>

<p>⊙ Capital of Yugoslavia Regarding the riots that occurred in the province of Argirocastro, Albania, well-informed sources here recently stated that the incident was caused by resistance to the country's Minister of Internal Affairs, Musa Juka, and was not against King Zog I, nor did it exclude Italian forces. It was similar to the riots launched by former Prime Minister Fan Noli on August 14, 1935. At that time, all factions joined the rebellion, such as the Nationalist Royalists and the pro-Italian faction. Musa Juka was the Minister of Internal Affairs at that time and punished them with severe measures. A total of 30 people were sentenced to death for the rebels, and 213 people were sentenced to lighter sentences. Many of those who opposed the government, even those who did not participate in the riots, were implicated. International public opinion, and even those around King Zog I, were greatly indignant. As a result, the Noli cabinet was uneasy in its position, and Musa Juka also stepped down. On October 22 of that year, a new cabinet was organized by Feraçeli, and the policies implemented were more lenient. The leader of the riots this time, Thaitodo, was appointed Minister of Education. At that time, the pro-Italian faction led by Musa Juka fiercely attacked the Feraceli cabinet. In March 1936, after Italy and Albania established a commercial agreement, the Feraceli cabinet was overthrown by the House of Representatives on November 7 of that year. Then, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Kota, succeeded as Prime Minister. Musa Juka and pro-Italian figures, such as the current Minister of Foreign Affairs, Libahova, re-entered the cabinet. On January 31, 1937, the House of Representatives held a re-election and won a majority of seats. Although the cabinet members stated that there were no communists in the country, the cabinet still began an anti-communist propaganda movement until now.

<h3>Japanese Hayashi Cabinet Decides to Revise Election Law</h3>
<p>And Orders Local Officials to Refresh Politics; Plans to Eliminate the Anti-Cabinet Movement Against Political Parties</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The National Conference of Local Governors of Japan held its first meeting here today. Prime Minister Hayashi delivered the opening address, in which there were three points that were quite important and have attracted attention from all parties. The first point is that Mr. Hayashi urged all local governors to spare no effort to refresh various political affairs from the standpoint of national mobilization, namely the refreshing of culture and education, the improvement of national physical strength, the increase of industrial productivity, and the enrichment of national defense. The second point is that Mr. Hayashi publicly stated for the first time that the Cabinet is currently working on revising the current election law, the success or failure of which is quite sufficient to determine the future trend of Japanese politics. Mr. Hayashi also said, "The appropriate revision of the election law is indeed the most urgent task at present, and the Cabinet now hopes to be able to draft a suitable draft." (Central News Agency, 17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi believes that the current election law needs to be fundamentally revised to adapt to the times. He is currently urging the internal affairs and judicial authorities to quickly start the investigation, and has clearly stated in his speech at the local governors' meeting today that the government is determined to revise the election law. It is reported that the fundamental revisions planned include adopting a large electoral district system, reducing the number of members of parliament, reducing the voting age and eligibility, expanding the public management system for elections, extending the current election period by one month, strengthening penalties, and making considerable reforms. As for whether this amendment will be submitted to a special parliament, Prime Minister Hayashi is currently adopting a cautious attitude towards this matter and will gradually decide after considering the situation of the military, political parties, and other parties in the future. However, there is also a saying within the government that the special parliament will be dissolved again, so how to handle this matter is attracting general attention. (17th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Seiyukai and Minseito parties are cooperating with each other to try to overthrow the Hayashi Cabinet, but the government completely ignores the anti-Cabinet movement of the political parties and is convinced that the current Cabinet will not be defeated by the political parties. Therefore, it still adheres to its consistent policy and plans to face the special parliament with new policies suitable for the times. According to the government's view, the political parties are taking advantage of the anti-government momentum promoted during the general election campaign to attempt to overthrow the Cabinet. If a considerable period of time passes, this kind of movement will inevitably subside. Therefore, if the Seiyukai and Minseito parties propose a resolution to impeach the government or demand a general resignation, the government will not only completely ignore it, but will also actively deal with the political parties and use new policies to eliminate the anti-Cabinet movement.

<h3>Japanese Local Governors' Meeting: Hayashi and Sato Give Speeches</h3>
<p>Another Round of Platitudes; Focus on People-to-People Contact with China</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Local Governors' Conference opened this morning at the Prime Minister's official residence. The main points of Foreign Minister Sato's instruction are as follows: The fundamental diplomatic policy of the Imperial Government is to seek the stability of East Asia and the realization of co-prosperity with all nations based on the national policy of the Empire, that is, international justice, to carry out a diplomatic policy that is consistent with the whole country, and to adjust international relations and extend national fortune. This should be well known to you all. I believe that at a time when the world situation remains unstable, in order to improve and enhance the international status of the Empire, the work of integrating the international situation is like strengthening the inseparable relationship between Japan and Manchuria, thereby adjusting relations with China and the Soviet Union, which is really necessary. However, in Sino-Japanese relations, the unfortunate incidents that occurred last year have continued to occur, and the resolution of various pending issues necessary to improve the national relations between the two countries is still at a standstill, which is truly regrettable. Recently, in China, due to the rise of national consciousness, the claim of "united resistance against Japan" has become a kind of buzzword. The National Government is moving towards the unification of China, such as the centralization of local powers, the financial consolidation after the currency reform, and the promotion of various construction projects with foreign capital. The solution of the Southwest issue and the ins and outs of the Xi'an Incident also have to be said to be a phenomenon that cannot be ignored. The anti-Japanese atmosphere in China seems to have arisen from a misunderstanding of the Empire's aggressive intentions towards China, but the Imperial Government certainly has no such intention. In the future, we must still make China fully understand this true intention and strive to improve Sino-Japanese national relations. Also, in view of the situation in China as described above, the policy in the future will be to first make people-to-people contact more frequent in order to reconcile the feelings of the two peoples. At the same time, promote cultural and economic work with Sino-Japanese cooperation as the main focus, thereby establishing a close economic interdependence relationship based on the masses of the two countries, and gradually seek to adjust the national relations between the two countries. The Soviet Union will establish the Third Five-Year Plan starting next year, focusing on the continued development of industry and the improvement of national culture, while striving to enhance its military strength. As for the current situation in the Far East Soviet territories, which have important relations with the Empire, the enrichment of armaments in that area and the construction of various military-related industries are flourishing. On the other hand, the Soviet government formulated a new constitution in December last year and implemented so-called democratic systems. Judging from the so-called anti-revolutionary conspiracy trials in August last year and January this year, it can be seen that Soviet domestic politics is quite complicated. The Imperial Government, on the one hand, is removing unnecessary friction between the two countries as much as possible and trying to resolve pending issues between the two countries, such as the fisheries treaty issue, the North Sakhalin rights issue, and the Manchu-Soviet border commission issue, and is striving to put the relationship between the two countries on a normal track.</p>
<p>Secondly, ensuring Anglo-Japanese friendship is highly desirable, but today there are still many points between the two countries that need to be adjusted, mainly centered on the China issue and the trade issue. The Keelung incident that occurred last October and the long-pending issue of the abolition of the perpetual leasehold rights have recently been resolved. The atmosphere between the two countries has gradually softened. The visit to England by His Imperial Highness Prince Mikasanomiya and Her Highness Princess Yuriko will further promote the opportunity for friendship, which is truly gratifying.</p>
<p>Japanese-American relations are currently very stable. In terms of trade relations, many disputes have occurred due to the progress of our country's overseas trade, but because both sides have been able to understand each other's positions, they have gradually entered the opportunity for resolution. Originally, the economic relations between Japan and the United States are interdependent, so we hope to use this as a basis to enhance the friendly relations between the two countries, cooperate sincerely, and jointly maintain peace in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Japanese-German relations were established in November last year with the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact. The Imperial Government, from the perspective of upholding the national polity and ensuring peace in East Asia, adheres to its firm policy on the communist movement. Because the Comintern openly targets Japan and Germany and implements its redification work, it recognizes the need to study international defense measures. Therefore, it established a joint defense agreement with Germany, which has the same position as our country. The government hopes to fully utilize this agreement in the future to achieve results.</p>
<p>Our country's foreign trade volume has been increasing year by year recently, and last year it showed a new record of 5.5 billion yuan. It is expected to expand in the first half of this year as well. However, various countries have established various restrictions on trade, especially maintaining a vigilant attitude towards the expansion of their own country's commodities. Therefore, in order to maintain and increase our country's commerce and trade, it is necessary to study appropriate and timely measures for the prevention and suppression of commodities from various foreign countries against our country. Regarding this point, small and large cases are constantly emerging around the world today, and our country's foreign officials are overwhelmed with the negotiations they are handling for this purpose. Currently, our country has spent several months conducting trade negotiations with British India, Burma, Dutch East Indies, and Australia, etc., and they have now been successfully resolved. Trade negotiations are currently underway with Turkey, Italy, Siam, Central America, and South American countries. (17th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The main points of Prime Minister Hayashi's instruction are as follows: The current urgent task is to clarify the fundamental meaning of the national polity, establish a guiding spirit suitable for the times, correct the confusion of thought within the country, and promote the revival of the pure national spirit. By this source, the true essence of the national polity is discovered in all kinds of political affairs, and the true stability of national life and the way to enrich national defense are further established. In the current domestic and foreign situation, the ways of sincere dedication to public service that should be promoted should all be based on this belief. What is more, in order to overcome this major difficulty, it lies in abolishing the old ways of following conventions, being vigilant, and being proud, and resolutely carrying out reforms suitable for the times. The various policies that the government will implement in the future will also be based on this principle, first of all, to refresh culture and education in order to cultivate the foundation of the national spirit, and at the same time to resolutely carry out reforms in all kinds of administrative affairs in order to meet the demands of the times. In addition, we will promote the revitalization of industry, the improvement of national physical education, and other policies. From the perspective of national mobilization, we will never be negligent. In short, what the government is planning is to comprehensively and harmoniously address the requests of the whole country in order to comprehensively revive and promote national strength, stabilize national life, and enrich national defense capabilities. Under this view, the government is preparing concrete plans for the above policies and is moving forward all the way. As for the members of parliament elected by the New Party in this session, we sincerely hope that they will use the spirit of selflessness and public service to fulfill the important responsibility of assisting the government with a correct understanding of the current situation. Therefore, they should rely on the activities of the various newly established institutions mentioned above and strive to concretize and implement the various policies one after another. As for the appropriate revision of the election law, I believe that it is an urgent task at present for the sound development of constitutional politics, and we intend to produce an appropriate plan in the near future. What I hope is that you will understand the domestic and foreign situation and, when applying various administrative affairs, pay attention to constantly instilling the correct understanding of the current situation into the minds of the people, so that the central government and the local governments can agree with one heart and one mind, jointly plan to overcome the difficulties of the times, and strive to expand the national fortune.

<h3>British Socialist Faction Decides to Dissolve Itself Automatically</h3>
<p>[London] The Socialist League, led by Sir Stafford Cripps, the leader of the extreme faction of the Labour Party, was originally affiliated with the Labour Party. Later, because it formed a united front with the Communist Party and the Independent Labour Party, it was dissatisfied with the Executive Committee of the Labour Party. The Labour Party should separate from the League. Now the League is meeting in Leicester to discuss this matter. It was decided immediately that the League should dissolve itself automatically from the end of this month before the Labour Party Congress can approve or disapprove of this decision of the Executive Committee so that all members can maintain their Labour Party membership in their individual capacity, but they do not need to withdraw from the United Front.

<h3>Former Spanish Prime Minister's Cabinet Formation Movement Fails</h3>
<p>Because the Prime Minister May Not Concurrently Serve as Minister of State, Former Finance Minister Negrín is Ordered to Form a Cabinet</p>
<p>⊙Valencia President Azaña today invited former Finance Minister Negrín to form a cabinet. The main reason for the failure of former Prime Minister Caballero to form a cabinet is said to be due to the opposition of the former Minister of Navy and Aviation, Prieto. (17th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>⊙Valencia After former Prime Minister Caballero declined the great mandate to form a cabinet, President Azaña recently appointed Negrín, a key figure in the moderate faction of the Socialist Party and former Minister of Finance, to organize a new cabinet. (Central News Agency, 17th Havas)</p>
<p>⊙Valencia Former Prime Minister Caballero reported to President Azaña this morning that he had been ordered to form a cabinet, but because the parties failed to fully agree with his plan, he announced his failure. Caballero is the leader of the left-wing Socialist Party. Now that he has failed to form a new cabinet, the president should invite Communist Party Secretary-General Díaz to try to form a cabinet. (17th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>⊙Valencia Officials announced today that the reason for the failure of Caballero to form a cabinet was due to the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the General Confederation of Workers, and the left-wing Republican Party refusing to participate in the new cabinet. What the Communist Party opposed was Caballero concurrently serving as Minister of Defense and taking away the seat of the Minister of Agriculture from the Communist Party. (16th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>⊙Valencia The Gazette reported that the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party, Caballero, resigned to President Azaña on Saturday. The president immediately ordered him to form a new cabinet, but Caballero has now declined the order to form a cabinet. Therefore, President Azaña has summoned the leaders of the Socialist Party and the left-wing Republican Party to discuss the formation of a cabinet. According to the Spanish news agency, Caballero's proposed cabinet formation plan included the establishment of a Supreme Military Council to handle all military issues, with the Minister of Defense making the final decision. After this plan was submitted to the various political parties for consideration, the Communist Party did not approve of it, and the Socialist Party was unwilling to participate in the new cabinet. At the same time, the Anarchist Labor Confederation also did not agree to reduce the number of new cabinet members. Therefore, Caballero had to abandon his task of forming a cabinet. (Central News Agency, 16th Reuters)</p>
<p>⊙Valencia The reason for the failure of former Prime Minister Caballero to form a cabinet was due to the Communist Party's various strong demands. In other words, ㊀ the Minister of Defense must not concurrently serve other positions, that is, the Prime Minister is not allowed to concurrently serve as Minister of Defense, ㊁ the general staff of the army, navy, and air force should be merged into a general staff department to directly command the battles of various routes and be responsible to the Minister of Defense and the Supreme Military Council, ㊂ the powers of the various defense committees should be exercised jointly by the committee members, and ㊃ various political and economic issues should be handled by the State Council. In addition, the Communist Party and even some members of the Socialist Party expressed dissatisfaction with Caballero personally. Now, former Finance Minister Negrín has been ordered to organize a new cabinet, and observers believe that the Communist Party and other parties will adopt a more moderate attitude. (Central News Agency, 17th Havas)</p>
<p>⊙Valencia Among the candidates with the highest voices to succeed former Prime Minister Caballero, in addition to former Minister of Aviation and Navy Prieto, former Finance Minister Negrín, and former Speaker of the House of Representatives Pesteiro (all of whom are well-known figures in the Socialist Party), there is also former Prime Minister Giral (a left-wing Republican who was originally a minister without portfolio). First, President Azaña decided to personally contact the leaders of the various parties and persuade Caballero not to resign. Yesterday, he summoned representatives from the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Republican Party to hold a meeting, urging the Communist Party not to insist on its own views so that Caballero's new cabinet could be established. When the Communist Party proposed conditions for participating in the cabinet yesterday, it insisted that the Minister of the Army must not concurrently serve in other departments. The representatives of the party promised to submit this issue to the Executive Committee for discussion, but in the end they insisted on not allowing it. Therefore, Caballero resigned from his mandate to form a cabinet at 10:15 p.m. yesterday, and at the same time disclosed the replies from the various parties regarding their participation in the cabinet one by one. Among them, the Communist Party opposed Caballero's proposed major policies, especially the Prime Minister concurrently serving as Minister of Defense. The Socialist Party said that if the new cabinet did not have the participation of the Communist Party, the party would not be willing to participate. In addition, the National Confederation of Trade Unions of the Socialist Party agreed to participate in the cabinet and advocated that the new cabinet should be established quickly. The Anarchist Labor Confederation said that if the number of seats occupied by the association is less than the number of seats occupied by the National Confederation of Trade Unions of the Socialist Party, it will be difficult to accept. At present, the leaders of the Communist and Socialist parties have ordered their members not to hold demonstrations in order to avoid disturbances. (Central News Agency, 17th Havas)</p>

At 8:00 AM sharp, Liu Luyin's appointed lawyers, Wang Zhaoxiang and Zhang Guoen, court-appointed defense lawyers Hu Sijiang, Xiao Buyun, and Yang Qixin, appointed lawyers Zhou Youqi and Wen Mao, and Xie Shengkan, the lawyer hired by the Yang Yongtai family to represent the private prosecution, arrived at the court one after another. Shortly after, Presiding Judge Liu Xianji (Chief of the Criminal Division), along with Associate Judges Wang Zhaoji and Yue Shutang, Clerk Shuai Guanjing, Prosecutor Zhu Chengzuan, and others, arrived in court. They immediately ordered the defendant Liu Luyin to be brought to the court. At 8:10 AM, Liu, wearing a gray flannel suit, was led into the courtroom by two bailiffs. The Presiding Judge immediately announced the opening of the trial and first asked Liu his name, age, native place, occupation, and address. (Central News Agency Note: Liu's voice was extremely low, and the reporters' seats were quite far away. The following recorded testimony may differ from the court's official record and should be verified against the court's official record. The same applies to the testimonies of Cheng Xiechao, Gong Baizhou, etc.)</p>
<p>Presiding Judge: You are a Central Committee member and Minister of Propaganda, following the Premier and striving for the National Revolution. From what year did you start? Liu: From the first year of the Republic of China. Judge: In what year did you actually follow the Manager and participate in revolutionary work? Liu: The ninth year of the Republic of China. Judge: What position did you hold in the Central Government when the Northern Expedition was successful? Liu: In the Central Party Headquarters. At this point, the Presiding Judge announced to Liu that you are being prosecuted in three parts in this case: ㊀ the crime of disturbing order, ㊁ the crime of jointly instigating murder, and ㊂ the crime of jointly instigating attempted murder. Judge: Were you in Guangdong in the 24th year of the Republic of China? Liu: Yes. Judge: Were you in Guangdong in the 25th year of the Republic of China? Liu: Before July, I was sometimes in Guangdong and sometimes in Guangxi. After July, I was often in Guangdong. Judge: During the 24th and 25th years of the Republic of China, the Southwest Executive Department of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was established in Guangzhou. What position did you hold in the Southwest Executive Department? Liu: I didn't hold any position, but I participated as a member of the Central History Committee, because any Central Committee member could participate in the Southwest Executive Department. Judge: During the 24th and 25th years of the Republic of China, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee was also established in Guangzhou. What tasks did you have in the Political Affairs Committee? Liu: The Southwest Political Affairs Committee was organized by the Southwest Executive Department, and I also participated as a Central Committee member. Judge: When was the Southwest People's Movement Committee established last year? Liu: I don't know when it was established. I was elected as a Standing Committee member in April. Judge: Where did you live in Guangzhou last year? Liu: In Henan Street. Judge: Did you go to Hong Kong last year? Liu: I often went to Hong Kong. Judge: Where did you stay in Hong Kong? Liu: I didn't necessarily stay in any particular place. Judge: Have you ever been to the New India Hotel in Hong Kong, number 15 or 27? Liu: I haven't been there. Judge: According to Xiao Ruoxu, you went to number 25 or 30 of the New India Hotel in Hong Kong. Now that you say you haven't been there, did your relatives or friends rent a room there? Liu: I don't know. Judge: Have you ever been to 77 Banham Road in Hong Kong? Liu: I haven't been there. Judge: Do you know Xiao Ruyun... these people? Liu: I don't know Xiao Ruyun or the others. Judge: According to Xiao Ruoxu, he visited Mr. Liu at 77 Banham Road on the morning of October 26th last year. Now that you say you haven't been there, how could he have visited you there? Liu: I don't know. Judge: Did Qian Shifu and others live at 77 Banham Road last year in October? Liu: I don't know. Judge: According to Xiao Ruoxu, Xiao Ruyun, Qian Shifu, and others lived upstairs at 77 Banham Road. Have you ever met them? Liu: No. Judge: Who is Xu Qun? Do you know? Liu: I don't know. Judge: Why was a plan for the Anti-Traitor Special Service Team of the Chinese Youth, drafted by Xu Qun and approved by you, found at 77 Banham Road? Liu: I don't know how that plan ended up there. Judge: Why was the general charter of the Revolutionary Army Corps of the Chinese Kuomintang, approved by you, also found at 77 Banham Road? Liu: This is because after the Guangdong-Guangxi Incident, the families of officials from various agencies were dispersed, and they took the plans from Guangzhou to Hong Kong. Judge: Why was a transportation budget approved by you also found at 77 Banham Road? Liu: No, that was taken away after the People's Movement Committee was dissolved. Judge: Why was a letter from you to Qian Shifu also found at 77 Banham Road? Liu: Because Qian Shifu was a contributor to the San Min Chu I Monthly, so I wrote a letter to him. Judge: Do you know Yang Xiaoming, Yang Erqian, Xu Qun, Xu Chao, Yang Bokun, and Yang Qizhen as individuals? Liu: I don't know any of them. Judge: Did you write the words "Approved, do as instructed" and "Luyin" on the back of the general charter of the Revolutionary Army Corps? Liu: There's something I can explain. After the Guangdong-Guangxi Incident, comrades felt it was necessary to organize a group to maintain contact among comrades and avoid accidents due to scattered residence. They felt that the international situation was extremely dangerous and that they should continue to fight for the country with the Three Principles of the People. They consulted me, and I thought there was already a party, so there was no need to form another group. Moreover, I am a bachelor with no money or territory. What could I do by organizing a national salvation group? (At this point, Liu Luyin followed the court's instructions and wrote about the meaning and hope of establishing the Revolutionary Army Corps.) Judge: Does the general charter of the Revolutionary Army Corps state that they should obey Liu Luyin, etc.? Is that true? Liu: That group was never established. Most of the initiators went abroad, and there were no funds or anyone looking for me. I can say that this charter is completely废弃 (abandoned, discarded). Judge: Assuming the Revolutionary Army Corps was established, would it have been organized with brigades, companies, and squads under the commander? Liu: It was never established, so there's no point in assuming. Judge: Why does the general charter of the Revolutionary Army Corps state that it was established on August 11th last year? Liu: August 10th was when they discussed the organization. Judge: Now, I'm asking you, was the transportation budget of 3,000 yuan per month approved by you? Liu: It was approved by me. Judge: Why did you approve it? Liu: This was for the San Min Chu I Monthly, founded by Mr. Hu Zhantang in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. This money was to promote the monthly. Judge: Did you write the letter to Qian Yuanfu on Mr. Hu's orders as well? Liu: I wrote a letter to him to promote the Three Principles of the People Monthly on Mr. Hu's orders. Judge: Why did you mention transportation costs in the letter? Liu: Because the letter was very clear about promoting the monthly. Judge: Did you write "20 yuan per month" on the back of the plan for the Anti-Traitor Special Service Team of the Chinese Youth drafted by Xu Qun? Liu: In April of the previous year, the Southwest authorities had an organization called the People's Movement Association. Because there were ronin harassing South China, they organized a special service team. When I was in Guangzhou, I was added as a Standing Committee member of the People's Movement Association. I wrote a few words on the back of the special service team plan according to their dictation, entirely out of patriotic motives. After I approved the plan, I resigned from the Standing Committee of the People's Movement Association in less than five days and went to Shanghai to work with Mr. Wang Liangchou to promote the unity of the Southwest and the Central Government. Mr. Wang Liangchou knew all about this. Judge: Was the special service fee for the Chinese Revolutionary Youth Corps? Liu: I haven't looked at the plan in detail. The Revolutionary Army Corps was after Chen Bonan resigned, and the Chinese Youth Special Service Team was before the Guangdong-Guangxi Incident. These two are certainly not related groups. Judge: How was the special service team organized? Liu: I don't know. Judge: What was the purpose of the special service team? Liu: As I said before, it was entirely against a certain country. Judge: What was the so-called work of the special service team? Liu: I don't know at all. Because after I approved the plan, I left Guangzhou for Shanghai in five or six days to promote the unity of the Southwest and the Central Government. Judge: Where did the special service team work, and who was doing the work? Liu: I don't know at all. Judge: Was the organization of the special service team your idea, or the idea of many people? Liu: Of course, it wasn't just my idea. Judge: Was the special service team directly under the command of the People's Movement Association, or was there someone else in command? Liu: I don't know. Judge: What was the so-called expansion of the organization in the special service team plan, from where to where? Liu: I don't know. Judge: When was the expansion of the organization? Liu: It was approved in April last year. I don't know when the expansion of the organization was. Judge: How do you explain the so-called anti-traitor group? Liu: Anti-traitor refers to the elimination of traitors who should be eliminated because of resistance against aggression. Judge: Was the anti-traitor organization responsible by an individual or by a majority of people? Liu: I don't know. Judge: What methods were used to eliminate traitors? Assuming there were ten traitors, how would they be eliminated, would they be eliminated all at once, or one by one? Liu: How would I know? Judge: What was the content of the so-called expansion of the special service team organization? Was it from Shanghai to Hankou? Liu: I don't know at all. Judge: Did you organize the assassination agency? Liu: How could I have organized it? I don't even know about this. Judge: Did you know Yang Yongtai (hereinafter referred to as Chairman), the former Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government? Liu: We were just friends. Judge: Did Chairman Yang follow the Premier and work for the revolution? Liu: I'm not sure, because I studied abroad in my early years. Judge: Before the Northern Expedition, what revolutionary work did Chairman Yang do with Chairman Chiang? Liu: I don't know, because I became friends with him after the Northern Expedition. We often met in Nanjing at that time. Judge: From what year did Chairman Yang work for the Central Government? Liu: It was after the Northern Expedition. Judge: What was your relationship with Chairman Yang like? Liu: Very polite. However, I have been in Guangdong in recent years, and he has been in Wuhan, so we don't often communicate. Judge: Is there any reason why you don't often communicate with Chairman Yang? Liu: No, as I said before, he was in Wuhan and I was in Guangdong, thousands of miles apart, so we naturally didn't communicate often. Judge: Before last October, did Chairman Yang do anything to offend you? Liu: No. Judge: Did Chairman Yang do anything to offend your relatives or friends? Liu: No, absolutely not. Judge: From when did you follow Mr. Hu Zhantang, and where? Liu: In Qingdao. Judge: What was the relationship between Chairman Yang and Mr. Hu like? Liu: As far as I know, they were good friends. Judge: Did Chairman Yang have any suspicions about you? Liu: No. Even if he did, how would I know? Judge: Did Chairman Yang have any suspicions about your relatives and friends? Liu: No. Judge: Do you know Cheng Xiechao and Gong Baizhou? Liu: I don't know them. Judge: Do you know that Chairman Yang was assassinated by Cheng Xiechao and Gong Baizhou? Liu: I don't know. Judge: Do you know that Yang Xiaoming was supervising and directing the assassination of Chairman Yang? Liu: How would I know? I don't know anything about the case. Judge: Did Yang Xiaoming and others communicate with you after Chairman Yang was assassinated? Liu: I don't know him at all, how could he communicate with me? Judge: Do you know about mailbox number 103 or 130 in Hong Kong? Liu: I don't know. Judge: Chairman Yang was assassinated at 3:00 PM on October 25th last year. When did you find out? Liu: I found out from the newspaper. Judge: What were your thoughts when you saw this news in the newspaper? Liu: Of course, I was very sad and heartbroken. Judge: What is your relationship with Xiao Ruoxu? Liu: When I was the Minister of Propaganda for the Central Government, he was an employee in the department. Judge: According to Xiao Ruoxu, Xiao Ruyun brought you the newspaper to read on the morning of October 26th. Is that true? Liu: No. Judge: According to Xiao Ruoxu, you seemed to have a sense of "ahead of the game" regarding the news of Chairman Yang's assassination. Is that true? Liu: That's a joke. I didn't meet him, how would he know I had a "ahead of the game" feeling? Judge: Xiao Ruoxu said that the payment to Xiao Ruyun had not been sent. Does this have anything to do with your approval "Sent by Ruyun"? Liu: I don't know. Judge: So, Xiao Ruoxu said that Xiao Ruyun said that the payment hadn't been sent for two months. Were those the two months of September and October last year? Liu: I don't know. Judge: Gong Baizhou was given 2,000 yuan in Hankou by Fan Qishu. Is that the 2,000 yuan you approved? Liu: I don't know. Judge: Gong Baizhou said the money came from Guangdong. Was it sent by Xiao Ruyun? Liu: I don't know. Judge: You really don't know Xiao Ruyun? Liu: I don't know him. Judge: Xiao Ruoxu said that the assassination of Chairman Yang was related to you. Do you know about that? Liu: That's a joke. It has absolutely nothing to do with me. Judge: Are you familiar with Zhang Qun, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs? Liu: We have a very good relationship. Judge: What is your relationship with Jiang Zuobin, the Minister of Interior? Liu: We are friends. Judge: What about Yu Feipeng, the Minister of Transportation? Liu: We are very good friends. He even treated me to dinner when I went to Beijing last year. Judge: What is your belief in Chairman Chiang? Liu: Of course, I have complete faith in him. To be honest, why have I sacrificed being the Minister of Propaganda and the Vice President of the Examination Yuan in these years? It's for the spiritual unity of the party leaders. Regarding this point, Mr. Dai Jitao, the President of the Examination Yuan, knows. After the 9/18 Incident, President Dai and others advocated for the spiritual unity of the party leaders. At that time, Mr. Hu was recuperating in Hong Kong, and everyone recommended me to go south to mediate. Although I was able to participate in the Southwest Executive Department as a Central Committee member, I didn't ask about things, and I didn't often attend meetings. Even when I did attend, I didn't speak. My only goal was to seek the unity of the party leaders. After Mr. Hu passed away last year, I could have gone north to work, but I should handle Mr. Hu's funeral for both public and private reasons. Later, the Guangdong incident happened, and they repeatedly asked me to stay, preventing me from leaving. Because of this, misunderstandings arose from outside. The hearing concluded at 11:15 AM. The Presiding Judge immediately announced a recess, and the hearing will continue at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Petition to Repair the Tomb of Han Shizhong</p>
<p>Deng Xianghai, from the county border of Suzhou, stated that the ancient tomb of Han Shizhong, a famous general of the Song Dynasty (also known as the Tomb of King Han Xin), is located in Lingyan Mountain in Mudu, Suzhou. He was a national hero of his generation, but it has been in disrepair for many years and is severely dilapidated. He specifically submitted a petition to the Provincial Government on the 17th to be forwarded to the Executive Yuan, requesting the Central Government to allocate funds for repairs.</p>
<p>Damage to the Su Yong Hospital</p>
<p>Gu Suyong, the院长 (director/chief physician) of the Su Yong Hospital outside Yanmen, Guangji Bridge, had a conflict with his wife, Zhang Yuanhua, due to family disputes. His wife left without notice a few days ago and opened a separate residence at the Central Hotel. Both parties hired lawyers and prepared to resolve the matter legally. On the morning of the 17th, his wife, accompanied by a Mr. Chen and a Mr. Lin, went to the Su Yong Hospital to negotiate with Gu Suyong. Because they were refused entry, his wife angrily destroyed the hospital's signboard and damaged other objects. The police arrived and took both parties to the third police station in charge, and then transferred them to the police station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Large Group of Japanese Tourists</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Japanese man named Takagi Chiyo Tairo led 57 Japanese people (including two Chinese people) from Shanghai to Changshu by car for sightseeing. After arriving at the station, several chartered steamers had already been hired, intending to abandon the cars and board the boats to first visit the West Lake. The local police officers, knowing that they were Japanese, immediately stepped forward to ask for their passports. However, the Japanese man only claimed to be an employee of the Shanghai Mitsubishi Trading Company and had no passport. Subsequently, after the police station called the headquarters for instructions, inspectors and others were dispatched to persuade them not to enter the city. Thereupon, the Japanese and others lingered at the station for a while before returning to Shanghai in the original cars.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Widening of North City Street in Progress</p>
<p>The County Construction Bureau plans to widen North Street and has already submitted it to the Construction Department for approval. An additional 100 vehicles will be allowed, each with a deposit of 150 yuan, totaling 15,000 yuan, which will be allocated to cover the cost of widening the street. On the afternoon of the 17th, the bureau convened a meeting of the construction discussion committee, including County Magistrate Yang Hanxi and Xu Chizi, to discuss the progress. Conclusion: ㊀ Now that the funding is secured, the Construction Bureau should immediately design the widening and actively proceed. ㊁ For the sake of long-term benefit, the width should be 8 meters, considering the prosperity of the business district. ㊂ The location of the reservoir will be discussed at the next meeting, taking into account the terrain and the principle of not obstructing waterway traffic by the Construction Bureau.</p>
<p>Mulberry Leaf Prices Soar</p>
<p>In the four suburban villages of this county, the spring silkworms are already in their early stage of first molt and the late silkworms in their second molt. However, the market price of mulberry leaves has been rising continuously in recent days, approaching 3 yuan per担 (dan, a unit of weight), and farmers are worried that they will lose money. The silkworm model area, because the period from the third molt to the large molt is very important for silkworms, has ordered all instructors to carefully guide them. Yesterday, it was learned that silkworms in the Wutangmen area of the third district were found to have a soft disease, and the farmers were extremely alarmed and immediately reported to the local instructors to find ways to help. The other districts have not changed, and the harvest is expected to be abundant in the future.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Shorter Period for Opium Addiction Rehabilitation</p>
<p>The county magistrates of Tong, Ru, Hai, Chong, Qi and Jing counties have resolved to shorten the period for opium addiction rehabilitation and eliminate it by the end of this year. This year's 6/3 Anti-Smoking Commemoration will be expanded to publicize and make the public aware.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Flour Mill Prepares to Resume Operations</p>
<p>The Yuheng Flour Mill outside the North Gate of this county is the only major enterprise in this county. Since the breach of the embankment in the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the factory was the first to bear the brunt and suffered huge losses. Only the factory building and rice were washed away. It has been nearly six years since then, and preparations for resuming operations have not been realized. After many preparations this time, it is expected to resume operations by the end of this month at the latest before the old lunar Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Reasons for Misinformation about Plague</p>
<p>It was previously reported that the plague occurred in Xiatangji in Beixiang, but this has been verified as misinformation. The reason is that in early May, most children in Xiatangji had illnesses with high fever and delirium, bleeding from the ears and nose. More than ten people have died in three to five days, resulting in various rumors. Unexpectedly, eight members of the Zhuangding team of the first district office stationed in Xiatangji also contracted the same disease. District Chief Wang Qinghao immediately sent people to bring Zhang Huaiduo and Jiang Chengru, two team members with serious illness, to Hefei for treatment at the Christian Hospital. After a blood test, the results were unknown, but they said it was the plague bacillus, and urgently telegraphed the Health Department. The Huainan Railway Bureau also urgently telegraphed the Central Construction Committee. Hefei society has always trusted the hospital and believed there was no mistake, so the rumor spread. Subsequently, Chen Wengui, a technician from the Central Health Department, came to Hefei to investigate and verify that it was indeed the Spring Fever epidemic and not the plague. The Huainan Road then resumed train tickets to Xiatangji on the 15th, and people's hearts were finally settled.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Implementation of Ringing the Bell to Lodge a Complaint</p>
<p>The Shaoxing District Court previously established a verbal complaint and report office on the right side of Tianmen to facilitate litigation and accept oral complaints and reports. Now, it has been ordered to set up a complaint bell to implement ringing the bell to lodge a complaint. Anyone who wants to make a verbal complaint, report, or confess can use it.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Provincial Chairman Visits Jiaxing for Inspection</p>
<p>Provincial Chairman Zhu Jiahua arrived in Jiaxing by car from Hangzhou along the Hangshan Road on the morning of the 17th. He first rested briefly at the Chief's Office and then had lunch at the Commissioner's Office. At 2:30 PM, he inspected the Zhuangding teams and county defense teams and county police teams in the urban area at the stadium and gave a speech. He also held a supplementary opening ceremony for the social military training cadre class and inspected the county's political situation. He finished at around 5:00 PM and then visited the scenic Nanhu Yanyu Tower. He took the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train back to Hangzhou at around 8:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Qiantang River Bridge Affects the Market</p>
<p>Wendi Town in Xiaoshan is one of the old Zhejiang East fishing markets. Futai, Dongsheng, and Tongyuan Xianxing lines are opened in the town. The lines directly collect and transport from Daishan. After being drunk-processed, they become the famous Xiaoshan Gua Xian and Zha Xian. The annual sales reach more than one million yuan. Now that the Qiantang River Bridge is about to be completed, the transportation network is changing and the freight transportation is trending toward modernization. Therefore, Dongsheng and Tongyuan lines moved to Jianggan in Hangzhou City on the 14th to adapt to the environment. Futai Line also announced the collection of debts yesterday, and the market in the town has suddenly declined.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Again Cables Requesting Prohibition of Wheat Exports</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Nanjing Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry: Regarding the matter of the Shanghai flour mill industry association's letter on the 15th of this month, which stated that the domestic wheat harvest of the previous year was greater than that of the 24th year of the Republic, and that market prices for wheat should be stable, allowing flour mills to operate more days than the previous year; however, wheat prices have instead increased, and flour mills' raw materials have decreased. The reason for this is that Japanese flour mills find Chinese wheat cheaper than Australian wheat, and are purchasing it in Wuhu, Hankou, Shanghai, and other places in our country. Our various factories have previously petitioned the Executive Yuan, as well as the Ministries of Finance and Industry, to prohibit the export of wheat. Our government, citing the protection of the rural economy, has not agreed to this request. However, the demand for wheat in our country exceeds the supply, and we have not achieved self-sufficiency. There is absolutely no concern of overproduction. Not prohibiting exports, at a time when old crops are depleted and new crops are not yet ready for harvest, leads to large-scale imports of foreign wheat, resulting in a significant economic loss. Protecting the rural economy in this way is an idealistic notion, while the economic loss has become a reality. Currently, Shanghai factories only operate for half the year, as tax records show. In reality, operations are intermittent, barely maintaining operations. Rice prices are falling, and flour prices are decreasing accordingly, but wheat prices fluctuate with foreign wheat, remaining high without any downward trend. The hardships of this situation are borne only by manufacturers. This year, continuous spring rains have reduced harvests in wheat-producing areas. In Jiangsu Province, it is estimated that the harvest will be less than 60% of last year's. The severe drought in Sichuan, Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces is unprecedented. One area has excessive rain, reducing harvests, while another area has severe drought, leaving no hope for autumn harvests. The future of flour mills is extremely worrying. Our factories all believe that paying taxes is an obligation that manufacturers should fulfill, and our government, having the right to collect taxes, should provide reasonable protection for flour mills to ensure fairness. If no protection is provided, flour mills will be forced to close due to environmental factors, affecting tax revenue, which will not benefit the government. What constitutes protection? Not allowing the export of raw materials, which puts flour mills in a desperate situation. It would be better to reduce imports of foreign wheat to stop this economic loss, which is a fundamental solution. Furthermore, the increased cotton production last year revitalized the textile industry, impacting both urban and rural areas, with clear results seen by the entire country. By analogy, prosperity in the flour industry will depend on increased wheat production. In addition to directly submitting this to the Executive Yuan and Ministries, we are corresponding to your organization, requesting that you forward this to the Executive Yuan, as well as the Ministries of Finance and Industry. On one hand, issue an order prohibiting the export of wheat, and on the other hand, instruct provinces and cities to plant more wheat this year, so that in the future, when supply exceeds demand, the ban on wheat exports can be lifted." When the chamber of commerce received the letter, it noted that the public association had requested a ban on wheat exports last year, which was not approved in order to increase wheat prices and benefit the rural economy. However, the wheat harvested last year is now a year old. Even farmers who store grain would have sold it all by now, with no remaining stores. Therefore, increasing prices through exports at this time would not benefit the rural economy. As for this year's wheat, it has not yet been harvested, and it is the time when old crops are depleted and new crops are not yet ready for harvest. The south has continuous spring rains, while the north has drought, causing disasters. The reduction in this year's wheat harvest is expected, which is different from the abundant wheat harvest of last year. In terms of policy, promoting agriculture and benefiting businesses should be equally important. In terms of measures, they should be adapted to the times and should not be rigidly adhered to. This year, various provinces urgently need grain for disaster relief. If flour mills have insufficient raw materials and can only operate for half the year, with intermittent work and reduced production, it will hinder the people's food supply. If we rely entirely on imported flour, opening up wheat exports would allow foreign flour to supplement its raw materials, refine them, and import them into our country. From the standpoint of saving economic losses, this plan seems too extreme. From the standpoint of ensuring the people's food supply, it is better to keep domestic wheat for domestic production than to exchange domestic wheat for foreign flour. What should be held on to and what should be let go of is self-evident. Previously, the flour mill industry association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces sent a letter stating the same situation on May 7th to the Executive Yuan (Ministries). Now, the association is requesting this again. We believe this matter concerns the interests of industry and commerce, and the people's food supply in the interior. We dare not repeatedly submit our request, hoping that the Executive Yuan (Ministries) will review and approve our request for the benefit of the public. Sincerely, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Freight Rates on Northern and Southern Shipping Lanes Surge</h3>
<p>Foreign Shipping Companies Reap Huge Profits</p>
<p>The shipping industry this year has shifted from the Yangtze River to coastal routes. Freight traffic on the northern and southern shipping lanes has been congested since March, and particularly developed in April. After foreign and Chinese shipping companies in this port announced a 10% increase in freight rates for coastal ports on May 1st, Chinese shipping companies, due to a limited number of ships and lack of tonnage, could not provide sufficient capacity despite a large volume of passengers and cargo. Foreign shipping companies, such as Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, and Nippon Yusen Kaisha, seized this great opportunity and increased the number of ships on the northern and southern shipping lanes, carrying huge amounts of cargo. Their revenue increased by approximately four to five times compared to the past two or three years. For example, the freight rate for shipping wheat flour from Shanghai to Tianjin, which was 9 cents per bag in the shortest time, has gradually increased to 57 cents, representing an increase of over six and a half times. Freight rates for other goods have also increased. For bulk goods, the freight rate for salt from Haizhou to Shierwei, which was originally 90 cents, has now increased to 2.50 yuan. The freight rate to Yuezhou has increased from 5 yuan to 12 yuan per ton. These are all rates for inferior goods that foreign companies do not bother to transport. In the past three years, northern and southern shipping lanes would receive approximately 3,000 to 4,000 yuan per trip. Now they receive at least 20,000 yuan or more, and still feel that there are more goods than ships. Only China Merchants Steam Navigation and Ningpo Steamship Company operate on the northern and southern shipping lanes from Shanghai, totaling six or seven ships. Foreign companies such as Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, and Nippon Yusen Kaisha currently operate approximately 30 regular and temporary ships sailing to Shantou, Xiamen, Min, Yue, Hong Kong, Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Tianjin. The number of Chinese ships is only one-fifth of the number of foreign ships, allowing foreign ships to take advantage of the situation and act like they have a rare commodity. In fact, foreign ships have gained a dominant position in the northern and southern shipping lanes. Further more, taking advantage of this great opportunity, they decided to discuss another increase in freight rates. Yesterday, shipping companies issued a notice that starting July 1st, all export goods from Shanghai to northern and southern ports will be subject to a 10% increase on the tariff (i.e., freight rate) as of July 1st, which has been communicated to all customers. Citing increased material costs, such as metals, it is rumored that there will be a third increase in freight rates on July 2nd. The method will be the same as the cases in May and June. All goods from Shanghai to northern and southern ports will be subject to an additional 10% freight increase. In reality, freight rates have increased by a total of 30% over three months (May, June, and July). The price increase is done in the name of five companies, but China Merchants Steam Navigation and Ningpo Steamship Company lack tonnage, so despite having a good business, they are watching foreign ships carry goods. Chinese shipping companies only have the name, while the benefits go to foreign companies. It is estimated that the losses incurred by foreign shipping companies over the years can be recovered in one fell swoop.</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony of the General Office of the National Goods Joint Operations Company Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang Personally Attended and Gave Instructions; Divided into Business, Administrative, and Accounting Sections</p>

<h3>Public Concession Public Latrine Contractors Appeal for Relief</h3>
<p>Several Measures</p>
<p>Joint Report from Citizens' Association Transferred to the Public Works Department to Request the Public Works Department of the Public Concession. According to a joint report from the Public Latrine Contractors Joint Association, the establishment of public latrines by the Public Works Department is for the convenience of the public. Our provision of toilet paper next to each public latrine is also for the convenience of the public. We rely on the income from the sale of toilet paper to support our families. In the early days, prices were relatively stable, and copper coins could be exchanged for silver at less than 200 coins per yuan, so it was still possible to maintain a living. However, prices have now risen, and the price of silver coins has increased, resulting in losses on both sides. The income from business is difficult to sustain our families. The Public Works Department believes that our management of public latrines and sale of toilet paper is very profitable and even sees it as an opportunity to get rich. They secretly extort money from toilet paper vendors at each public latrine, which has gradually become a public secret. Now the secret has become public, and they have actually advertised for bids in the newspaper. Last year's bid price was 3,853 yuan, which was won by Zhang Tongxing (i.e., Dongfangxing Company). Zhang Tongxing declared to the toilet paper vendors at each public latrine that the Public Works Department was experiencing financial difficulties and the bid price was high, and the vendors had suffered significant losses due to the sudden drop in copper coins, which the Public Works Department was well aware of. Therefore, they recently planned to cancel the "This is a public toilet for men only, no charge for entry" sign at each public latrine from March 1st. Each sheet of toilet paper would cost one copper coin, but the sale of toilet paper would not be forced. The vendors believed this was true and were happy to contract. However, many months have passed and it has not been implemented, which is shocking. The Public Works Department publicly advertised for bids for the management of public latrines and the sale of toilet paper, which should be a legal operation protected by the Public Works Department. How can they allow people to enter and exit without paying, taking advantage of a small profit? If the Public Works Department is truly considering the convenience of the public, then they should not have publicly advertised for bids in the first place. How can we recover the bid price we paid? If they believe that the price of toilet paper is one copper coin, but make it clear that the sale of toilet paper is not forced, who in society would not be greedy for cheap prices? How can we recover the bid price we paid? In the beginning, the price of toilet paper was one copper coin, which was worth 5 li of silver. If we still follow the old regulations today, how can we poor vendors bear this loss? Prices are rising daily, and the bid price is high, putting us in a difficult situation. This is a hardship that no other industry has experienced. Furthermore, the problems do not end there. The Public Works Department's sanitation department also makes things difficult for the vendors, prohibiting sales. If they disagree, they force us to pay fines. We do not know what the Public Works Department means by collecting the bid price. If we were not trying to make a profit by selling toilet paper, why would we waste our energy and money? The Public Works Department is aware of the above-mentioned actions, but has turned a blind eye. Recently, the pressure has been increasing, and we poor vendors are truly worried about our survival. We are forced to request that your association consider the current difficult times, be sympathetic to the plight of the poor, and uphold justice, urging the Public Works Department to improve the following measures: ㊀ Request the cancellation of the "no charge for entry" sign. ㊁ Re-establish the price of toilet paper. ㊂ Request a reduction in the bid price. ㊃ If the above three items cannot be achieved, the Public Works Department should cancel the bidding contract and hire its own management personnel to handle the matter. We sincerely request that your association forward the above four measures to the Public Works Department for prompt reform and action.</p>

<h3>The Various Circles' Sichuan Disaster Relief Association Held Its First Board of Directors Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chairman Zhang Qun Reported on Seven Items of Association Affairs. Ren Wangyu Returned to Shanghai and Described the Sichuan Disaster Situation. Wang Yiting Donated 2,000 Yuan for Relief as the First Donation.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Various Circles' Sichuan Disaster Relief Association held its first joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the Bank Association on Hong Kong Road at 4 PM yesterday. Approximately one hundred people attended, including Wu Dingchang, Zhou Zuomin, Zhang Qun, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Hongjun, Wang Yiting, Zhang Xiaolin, Xu Kan, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Fu Rulin, Ji Lanting, Yu Zuoyan, Qu Wenliu, Song Hanzhang, Wang Boqi, Tang Shoumin, Ye Zhuotang, etc. Chairman Zhang Qun, Fu Yuchang, and Yang Zehuan recorded the proceedings. Zhang Qun reported as follows: Since the establishment of this association, today is the third meeting. I have a few points to report to everyone: ㊀ Two directors of this association, Ren Wangnan and Kang Xinru, have come from Sichuan, and they must have a clearer and more accurate understanding of the disaster situation in Sichuan. We can ask them to report. ㊁ Please discuss how this association's fundraising work should proceed. ㊂ Starting from today, this association has officially opened its office at No. 401, China Merchants Bank Building. All previous Sichuan Disaster Relief Associations have been merged into this association. All the directors and deputy directors of the propaganda and fundraising groups have been re-elected as directors of this association and should be asked to continue their positions. All members of the two groups will be recommended as staff of this association. ㊃ The donation registers originally issued by the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association will continue to be used for the time being. Once the donation registers of this association are ready, they will all be replaced. ㊄ The ten thousand dollars previously borrowed from Juxingcheng, Chuan Kang, Chuan Yan, Mei Feng, and Commercial Five Banks by Vice Chairman Xu Keting, who was responsible for it, has been sent to the Sichuan Province Relief Association for emergency relief. Now this association should be responsible for gradually repaying the banks on average from the donations received later. ㊅ The fundraising of this association must wait until the donation registers are printed before it can begin. However, Jin City Bank voluntarily raised 5,000 yuan for Sichuan disaster relief at its anniversary celebration the day before yesterday. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of tens of millions of disaster victims in Sichuan Province. ㊆ The association's operating expenses will be temporarily borrowed from Juxingcheng by Vice Chairman Xu Keting for 1,000 yuan for expenses. Then, Ren Wangnan reported that he only stayed in Sichuan for three weeks this time. There are a total of 145 counties in Sichuan Province. According to a recent accurate survey by the Sichuan Provincial Government, there are 26 counties with severe disasters, 46 counties with secondary disasters, and 68 counties with minor disasters. Only nine counties in western Sichuan have not been affected by the disaster. The number of disaster victims, excluding those who can be rescued by their own efforts, is estimated to be 30 million people who need relief. Distributing 2 million for emergency relief would give each person only a few cents, which would really be of no help. Now that the Xiaoman solar term is approaching, only light rain has fallen, and the fields are still cracked. This year's rice cannot be planted, and the autumn harvest is also hopeless. Deaths are increasing day by day. According to what I know in Zhong County, there is a mass grave that has been dug, and more than 10,000 people have been taken to the pit after starving to death. In Chongqing, people are starving to death in public, and burials cannot keep up, so a cremation ground has been established. The severity of the disaster can be seen from this. Mayor Yu Hongjun said that everyone felt very sad after hearing Mr. Ren's report. We must recognize that Sichuan is the vitality of the entire Chinese nation. Sichuan's disaster will have a great impact on the entire nation. Disaster relief is like putting out a fire. We must rush to find a way to rescue. I serve in Shanghai and will do my best to support disaster relief work in all provinces and will actively follow everyone. Wu Dingchang then proposed two fundraising methods: ㊀ Leaders of various organizations should voluntarily initiate fundraising. ㊁ All circles in Shanghai should voluntarily fundraise. Fu Mubo also suggested estimating how much money can be raised and borrowing it from the banking sector to remit it to Sichuan, which will be gradually repaid with the income from donations in the future to meet the purpose of emergency rescue. Finally, Lin Kangyi spoke about the methods proposed by Wu and Chuan. It is proposed that this association convene a meeting of standing directors and supervisors on the 19th to submit the decision for implementation, which was approved by the whole body, announced the adjournment, and Wang Yiting, in view of the severity of the Sichuan disaster, made a special donation of 2,000 yuan to serve as relief funds and planned to wait for the Shanghai Various Circles' Sichuan Disaster Relief Association donation register to be printed and help solicit donations from all parties.</p>

<h3>Rong Zongjing Talks About Developing the Northern Jiangsu Salt Reclamation Area</h3>
<p>The Land is Vast and the Soil is Fertile, Most Suitable for Planting Cotton. Mr. Rong Advocates Replacing Relief with Work.</p>
<p>Amidst the high-pitched National Economic Construction Movement, the entire country, both government and public, are actively striving to develop various industries and increase agricultural production in rural areas. Since the financial community of this city organized a delegation last year to inspect the coastal salt reclamation area of Northern Jiangsu, they believe that it is most suitable for planting cotton. They have planned to organize a banking group to specialize in investment and development, so that leaders from all walks of life will continue to advocate and strive to increase cotton production in order to complete Jiangsu Province as the primary cotton-producing province. According to Mr. Rong Zongjing, a magnate in the cotton yarn industry who enthusiastically supports this matter, he gave a detailed interview to a reporter from the Industrial Society. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Northern Jiangsu Reclamation Area is Most Suitable for Planting Cotton</p>
<p>According to Mr. Rong, the cotton-producing areas in China include twelve provinces, including Yi, Yu, Shan, Lu, Wan, and E. Among them, Hebei Province has the most abundant cotton production, accounting for about two-fifths of the production of various provinces each year. In the past, most of the textile raw materials in the country relied on the supply of the province. Now that the cotton in the province has been monopolized by Japanese merchants, Chinese merchants' raw materials have been significantly affected. As for the remaining cotton-planting provinces, the annual output is not very large, and it only serves to supply Chinese merchants to maintain the current status quo. If we want to increase textile production, then the raw materials will not be enough. Therefore, last year, the financial community, in view of the above points, organized an inspection group to go to the coastal area of Northern Jiangsu for inspection. After field investigation and research, it was determined that the land in the salt reclamation area is suitable for planting cotton, and there is an urgent need for investment and development. Therefore, after returning to Shanghai, the Northern Jiangsu Cotton Reclamation and Garrison Banking Group was organized to jointly advocate the cotton planting business.</p>
<p>Vast Land, Valued by All Circles</p>
<p>According to the salt reclamation area, there are a total of 15 to 16 million mu of land along the coast from Haizhou to Nantong. If we can work together to actively develop it, then in two or three years, Jiangsu Province can be expected to become the primary cotton-producing province. According to general concerns, it is expected that once the area is developed, it can increase cotton production by 1.5 million dan each year. Including the original output of 2.3 million dan, it can be higher than the output of Hebei Province. In addition, the diversion of the Huai River is about to be completed, so there is no need to worry about floods. Not long ago, I (Mr. Rong said himself) jointly suggested with Minister of Military and Political Affairs He Yingqin, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government Chen Guofu, and Miao Peicheng to develop the area and promote cotton production. After many efforts, considerable success has been achieved.</p>
<p>Chen Guofu's Assistance is the Most Powerful</p>
<p>According to Mr. Rong, Chairman Chen Guofu of Jiangsu Province provided the most assistance to the planning and development of the reclamation area. He has repeatedly sent personnel to inspect, and the most important work has been implemented step by step. However, according to my wishes, I deeply hope that the National Economic Committee and agricultural cooperatives, agricultural treasury, etc., will assist in completing Mr. Chen's grand plan so that our country will achieve prosperity. Recently, the droughts in Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and other provinces have been severe, and countless people are dying. The best policy should be for all sectors to continue to find ways to move the disaster victims in each province to the area to plant cotton, replacing relief with work, which will both enrich the country and rescue the disaster, killing two birds with one stone.</p>

<h3>The Dinghai Fellow Villagers Association Telegraphs to Negotiate and Stop Japanese Vessels from Encroaching on Fishing Grounds</h3>
<p>According to reports from fishermen, the Dinghai Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai stated that Japanese fishing vessels have encroached on the ocean area of Shengshan and Sheshan to fish. They telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Industry, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government this month to negotiate and stop them. The original text is as follows: (Omitted above) According to reports from fellow villagers, many Japanese fishing vessels have been encroaching on the ocean area of Shengshan and Sheshan at the junction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, fishing across the border, and have been doing so to this day. Our Chinese fishermen have been using the old method of fishing, so it is inexhaustible, and the next fish season can still be fished as usual. The fish will definitely not be reduced because of it. Now, the Japanese fishing vessels use the new method of heavy nets. The ships are equipped with wireless electricity. Most fishing vessels are scattered in the north and south oceans to scout. Once a school of fish is discovered, each ship is immediately called by telegram to encircle and catch it. Wherever the Japanese ships go, the fish are empty, and there will be no fish to catch in the future. All of our fishermen feel a great impact. The Japanese fishing boats use extremely sturdy machines and travel quickly. They charge and bump, and all of our nets are abandoned in the ocean. There is no way to find them. Our fishing boats have to avoid each other. If you are not careful, you will be hit and sunk. The number of victims is countless. Fishermen are not only in danger of livelihood, but also in danger of life. I have to ask your association to find a way to forward it to the government for negotiation and suppression. According to the investigation, Japanese fishing vessels come to our country's territorial waters to fish across the border from time to time, and now they invade our nearest fishing grounds, hindering the livelihood of our fishermen. If we do not seriously negotiate to stop them, then in the future, our country's coastal fishing grounds will inevitably be gradually forced by them, threatening millions of our fishermen. The consequences are unthinkable. According to the report, the previous situation was used to hold the telegram and ask "Jun Yuan to examine and approve the rapid order of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to strictly negotiate and stop it," "Jun Bu (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) to examine and approve the rapid and strict negotiation and suppression," "Jun Bu (Ministry of Industry) quickly consults the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to strictly negotiate and suppress it," "Jun Fu quickly consults the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to strictly negotiate and suppress it."

In addition to resolving many important resolutions, the Shanghai Fish Market and Brokerage Association sent representatives Xu Yangxian and others, nine people, to the meeting, requesting Chairman Du to present the details of the fish vendors' strike. After Mr. Du received them, he said that the fish vendor representatives asked me for a few points the night before. After I explained, and allowed the reasonable items to be submitted to the Board of Directors for consideration, the representatives promised to resume their business unconditionally. Unexpectedly, today's newspaper published an apology announcement, which is slightly inconsistent with the facts, and it concerns the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Industry. The amendment has a certain procedure. Please do not misunderstand. Regarding how to reduce the handling fee, the Board of Directors decided today to hand it over to the Standing Committee to convene representatives of the Brokerage Association to discuss specific methods.

Since the crackdown on smuggling has been intensified, smuggling has been slightly stopped, but the trend of dumping is becoming more intense, only because the inspection of smuggled artificial silk is strictly prohibited, and it is not easy to import. Official road transportation, customs duties are particularly heavy, and the tax on woven silk is lighter than that of artificial silk. The neighboring countries are very cunning and avoid it. Therefore, the dumping of foreign silk is rampant. According to artificial silk, each box weighs about 200 pounds, and the value is about 150 yuan. The specific tax is about 250 yuan in national currency per box. If neighboring countries use this raw material to weave goods to China, the previous tax was 80% of the value, only about 120 yuan is required, and there is room to take advantage of. Therefore, a large number of woven products are fully dumped. Since January, the silk market has been chaotic. Large and small retail stores in the country are dumping it at low prices and competing to purchase it to attract customers. Inferior goods are sold quickly, while Guochou silk is not progressing. Only because the customs duties are reversed, the balance is lost, and the difference is more than doubled. This strange phenomenon of guests occupying the host has been staged. If this continues, my country's silk weaving industry and commerce will have no living space, and the livelihoods of millions of weavers in the two provinces will sit and wait to die. If the customs duty balance is not modified, how can this crisis be saved? You should invite the association to convene a meeting of members of the same industry in the two provinces as soon as possible to elect representatives to go to Beijing to petition, and must change the import tax rate of artificial silk to ad valorem tax to remedy the bias, so that domestic silk merchants and the majority of workers will not die under the unequal customs duties, and can maintain their inherent livelihood, and it is urgent to wait for orders, etc., According to this, the import tariff of artificial silk and artificial silk fabrics is too light and too heavy, resulting in foreign businessmen taking the opportunity to dump a large number of artificial silk woven products into China, resulting in the current situation of the national silk industry and commerce in the evening. The association has repeatedly requested the Ministry of Finance to modify the tariff rules, make appropriate adjustments, but has not been approved. Now, my country's silk industry has been deeply affected, and labor will be exhausted. Only gathering, the full strength of the same industry in the province, resolutely striving, is enough to save it, otherwise, if we continue to delay ourselves, the livelihood of millions of industrial and commercial people in the two provinces will be trapped in failure. Therefore, it is specifically determined to hold an emergency meeting of the same industry in the two provinces at 3 PM on the 18th (Tuesday) at the association's location in Gaodun Street, Jiumu Ground, Shanghai, to discuss the export method, and make a public decision to implement it. Please, representatives of your association, come to Shanghai at that time to attend the meeting and express your great views, which is the most anticipated. To the same industry associations of the silk weaving industry in various places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, it is heard that representatives from various places have replied to the letter to attend and discuss."</p>

<h3>Shanxi Province Is Building the Jin-Sui Railway and Raising Funds from the Shanghai Silver Community</h3>
<p>Using the Tongpu Railway as Collateral. An Agreement Will Be Reached Soon After Negotiations in Tianjin.</p>
<p>In order to develop the transportation industry, Shanxi Province has been quite active in railway construction in recent years. Director of Pacification Yan Xishan is now planning to build the Jin-Sui Railway to facilitate the transportation of goods and passengers in Taiyuan and Guihua. Special personnel are discussing loan negotiations with China Communications and other banks. Shenzhou News Agency reporters have learned from relevant parties that Jin Yan once sent personnel to Tianjin to contact the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Chinese Farmers Bank, and decided to use the Tongpu Railway as collateral to borrow 5 million yuan for the construction of the Jin-Sui Railway. However, the situation is quite complicated, so it has not been fully negotiated. The three banks have not yet discussed how to allocate the loan of 5 million yuan. It is expected that the railway construction bank community should be happy to cooperate and assist in this loan, but the Jin Provincial Government has not yet sent personnel to Shanghai for contact.</p>
<h3>Case of Korean Drug Dealers Assaulting Police Officers</h3>
<p>The responsible police station has already reported the incident. The General Bureau is negotiating with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>In the Beisichuan Road area of this city, located in Hongkou and belonging to the extraterritorial road construction zone, many Japanese Koreans reside. Among them, unscrupulous individuals frequently engage in drug trafficking and sales, employing various schemes, making arrests quite challenging. In recent years, the responsible police station has repeatedly, in conjunction with the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai, cracked down on over a dozen drug-selling operations, arresting over three or four hundred drug users. However, their activities have not diminished. This is because they rely on consular jurisdiction as a shield, being repeatedly arrested and released, which is insufficient to deter them. Recently, in order to eliminate the atmosphere of drugs, the responsible police station drafted a plan and submitted it to the General Bureau for approval, organizing a plainclothes drug-arrest team to be stationed near various drug-selling operations within the area, to monitor and arrest drug buyers. This operation began on the 14th of this month and has been quite successful in recent days, with over a hundred drug offenders arrested. As a result, drug buyers have become cautious, and drug-selling Koreans have become greatly alarmed. Therefore, these drug sellers have gathered in groups of three to five to escort drug buyers and assault drug-arresting officers to resist arrest. Unexpectedly, at 12:00 noon on the 16th, Li Bao-cai, a police officer from the drug-arrest team of the station, was stationed near a Korean drug-selling operation at No. 5, De Kang West Lane, Qiujiang Road, when he saw a Chinese man wearing a blue short shirt and trousers enter the premises and then hurriedly exit, followed by three Koreans protecting him. To avoid conflict, the officer did not search the man but followed him to the Yongxing Road police district on Qiujiang Branch Road. Seeing that the Koreans were far away, he rushed to search the Chinese man, but was spotted by the Koreans, who rushed up, seized the drug offender, and surrounded and beat Officer Li Bao-cai. He sustained severe head and waist injuries and lost consciousness on the spot. He was rescued by residents and escorted back to the station. Upon hearing the news, the station chief immediately sent the injured officer to Fumin Hospital for treatment and notified the Japanese Consulate by telephone to strictly apprehend the offending Koreans. He also reported the situation to the General Bureau, requesting them to lodge a serious protest.</p>

<h3>Chen Zongyu Reported by Divorced Wife</h3>
<p>Accused of Two Fraud Cases Due to Losing Lawsuit, Another Case Involving Su Wu</p>
<p>Chen Zongyu, a former clerk of the First Special District Court, married a woman named Qi Huizhen. Later, Chen and Qi developed animosity, and Chen became acquainted with another woman named Wang Lanzhen. Now, Chen and Qi are involved in mutual lawsuits, both criminal and civil, extensively. Recently, most of these cases have concluded. However, in the case where Qi Huizhen was ordered to return furniture expenses to Chen Zongyu, the court has begun enforcement. Therefore, Qi harbored resentment and filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the First Special Court, accusing Chen Zongyu of suspected fraud during his tenure as a clerk. The events she cited are two: ① The quit-smoking drug "Dwarf Gourd Essence" sold by Puda Pharmacy was found to contain toxic substances. The police seized and prosecuted the pharmacy in court. The pharmacy owner, Xu Jifang, requested Chen Zongyu to have the seized drugs returned and the arrested suspect declared innocent. At that time, Chen demanded 500 yuan, and they settled on 250 yuan. Xu first paid 100 yuan in cash, then continued with 50 yuan in cash and a check. Later, because it was not done, Xu stopped the check. Chen then colluded with an Indian named Ha Chai-la-sheng to sue Xu. ② Huang Huaisheng of the Jinan Film Company, due to a civil case, was about to have his property sealed by the court. Huang sent someone to Chen's office, requesting assistance to postpone the sealing for a few days so that the items could be moved away. Chen then forwarded the request to Wei Xifu. However, the amount of compensation Chen received from Huang is unknown. Upon receiving the complaint, the Procuratorate immediately issued summonses to Qi and Chen, ordering them to appear in the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court for investigation yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Chen is now practicing as a lawyer and has formed a firm with foreign lawyer Da Dou at No. 142, Bowuyuan Road. When the bailiff delivered the summons, the staff of the firm said that Chen was not in Shanghai, so the summons could not be delivered. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan opened the court with the prosecutor to investigate. Qi Huizhen explained the process, stating, "Because of the divorce lawsuit with Chen, not only did Chen not give me alimony, but he also ordered me to return the furniture expenses, which has already been enforced, leaving me with no recourse. Therefore, I have no choice but to expose Chen's inside story to your office. Chen is indeed in Shanghai and has not left. He currently resides at No. 32, Hengqing Lane, Beile Road, in the French Concession. Someone saw him there yesterday." Prosecutor Song examined the confession and postponed the hearing for further review, issuing a warrant for Qi Huizhen to arrest Chen Zongyu and bring him to justice. Then, the court adjourned. The aforementioned Wei Xifu is actually Wei Suwu, a clerk of the First Special Court. After Prosecutor Song adjourned the court, he continued the investigation in the Sixth Court at noon. He ordered Wei to post bail and await further questioning.</p>
<h3>Yesterday was Buddha's Birthday</h3>
<p>Jing'an Temple was Bustling</p>
<p>Yesterday was the eighth day of the ninth lunar month, which Buddhists consider the birthday of the Buddha. Therefore, temples throughout the country celebrated yesterday.</p>
<p>In this city, the Jing'an Temple is the most bustling on this day every year. Therefore, from dawn, the pilgrims came in an endless stream, rushing to burn the first incense. From 8:00 AM, pilgrims came and went like weaving, and tourists and idlers gradually gathered. There was hardly any space inside the temple, and the incense smoke was blinding and the candle flames were scorching. Most of the pilgrims were women, with fewer men. They all carried a yellow cloth bag on their shoulders, worshipped the Buddha with utmost respect. The stone well in front of the Jing'an Temple was once known as a scenic spot, the "Sixth Spring under Heaven." However, on ordinary days, the spring water is dry and dirty, not worth a visit. Today, the situation has changed. Pilgrims have been putting in pre-purchased creatures such as fish, turtles, and snails, causing onlookers to crowd around like a wall, as crowded as the temple. The temporary stalls set up within a few miles around the temple were inconvenient for shopping due to the excessive number of people. According to the stallholders, the business of each stall was not as prosperous as the previous Sunday. While returning, the reporter of Datong News Agency saw the mounted police officers dispatched by the Jing'an Temple police station patrolling in groups of three to five, prohibiting pedestrians from stopping and not allowing stalls to place goods on the sidewalks, so the order was good. It is also learned that all temporary stalls will be removed at 6:00 PM today.</p>

<h3>The Tianyi Labor Strike Resolved</h3>
<p>Work Resumed Universally Yesterday Morning, Order was Very Good</p>
<p>The Tianyi Silk Factory at the intersection of Jin Sheng Road and Pingliang Road in Hongkou, this city, employs more than 200 workers. Its business is usually quite prosperous. This time, the workers demanded that the management improve treatment, causing a strike. After repeated mediation by the Municipal Social Bureau and the ruling on various measures, the management could not fulfill them, causing the strike to drag on for more than a month without a solution. Zhou Xuexiang, acting chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in consideration of the workers' pain and to eliminate the strike, convened a mediation between labor and management on the 14th of this month, together with the Huaru Road branch of the Fourth District Silk Reeling and Weaving Industry Union. Li Yinchu and Zhang Yancheng represented the management, and Ma Zongsui and Qian Wupu represented the labor. They worked hard to persuade both sides. In addition to complying with the measures ruled by the Municipal Social Bureau, the management sincerely accepted various requests from the workers. Both sides were satisfied. All the workers resumed work in the factory yesterday morning, accompanied by Hu Menglin, a member sent by the General Federation of Trade Unions. The Yulin Road police station sent Chinese and Western detectives to protect the outside, and the order was very good. The labor strike was resolved.</p>
<h3>Female Hostess Met an Unsavory Person, Destitute and Ill Seeking Help</h3>

Eventually, she became acquainted with Yang Shaoxing from Tongzhou. Unexpectedly, Yang treated her in every way, causing Fengying to suffer from severe dry blood disease. Yang showed no pity and fled. Fengying was destitute and ill and was evicted by the landlord. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, she squatted on the sidewalk of Xinqiao Street, Minguo Road, groaning and sobbing. Passersby Jin Zhimei and Shao Yinren saw her and, moved by righteous indignation, accompanied her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Afterward, they accompanied her to the Lao Bei Men Police Station, seeking relief. After questioning, Yan Fengying had no relatives in Shanghai and presented a hostess pass from Tianyun Building. It was used as a piece of paper to be sent to the Bureau for relief.</p>
<h3>Patient Jumps From Building, Seriously Injured</h3>

At 5:30 PM the day before yesterday (the 16th), he was found lying in front of No. 19, La Fayette Road, French Concession. Hua Bu No. 216 saw it and reported it to the Xiahui Police Station, which dispatched a team to send him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At around 12:00 noon yesterday, Wang, due to mental disorder, took advantage of the unpreparedness of others and jumped from the balcony of the four-story ward to escape, falling heavily.

However, Team Leader Liu Huai of the Detective General Team, because the mastermind of the case had not yet been apprehended, submitted a request to the Police General Bureau through the Xinzha Branch. Yesterday morning, the General Team dispatched personnel to arrest the mastermind Shi Chao-gan and bring him to the team. He is currently being interrogated. It is said that Shi was arrested in Caojiadu.</p>
<h3>The Gongyi Factory Dismissal of Workers, Severance Pay Issued This Morning</h3>
<p>Party and Government Personnel Dispatched to Monitor</p>
<p>The British-owned Gongyi Cotton Mill on Robert's Road, Western Shanghai, previously had a strike due to the dismissal of foremen. After a long stalemate, party and government organs sent personnel to mediate, and six resolution measures were signed. All workers also returned to work in the factory on the 14th. The factory has decided to dismiss 60 workers and will issue dismissal pay in the factory at 10:00 AM this morning (workers with pensions will be paid according to the pension, one month for each year; workers without pensions will receive three months of severance pay; if the pension is less than three months, the factory will make up the difference). However, seven apprentices have no pension regulations. Therefore, party and government organs negotiated with the factory to compensate them with 500 yuan in national currency. The Municipal Party Department decided to send Wu Wenbang, Wang Xianqing of the Social Bureau, and Jia Enchao, director of the Caojiadu Branch of the Police Bureau, to monitor to avoid further misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>Assault While Watching a Free Show</h3>
<p>Ma Zenggui Sentenced to One Year</p>
<p>The Changzhou Opera House, Shanghai's First Stage in the No. 934, Qiwupu Road, has been quite prosperous recently. It was coveted by the ruffian Ma Zenggui (from Shaoxing) and others. At 7:40 PM on the 6th of this month, he and more than a dozen companions went to watch the show. He failed to enter without buying tickets and quarreled with the receptionists and ticket-buying tea servants Chen Fengqing, Xu Zhenxing, Yang Xinglin, and Wang Arong. They then used iron rulers and wooden sticks to injure Chen's head, back, shoulders, and arms and fled in different directions. Later, Chinese and Western detectives from the Yuyi Road Police Station arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested Ma, seizing a short iron stick from him. He was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The previous day, Judge Xiao Xiefei came to the court for a continued hearing. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated that the defendant assaulted while watching a free show and an iron rod was seized from him. He asked for a strict investigation. According to the victims' testimony, the defendant's testimony was ambiguous. Judge Xiao sentenced Ma Zenggui to one year of imprisonment and confiscated the iron bar.</p>
<h3>Germany Recruits a Large Number of Chinese Laborers in Shanghai</h3>
<p>A Total of Sixty-Three People, Scheduled to Sail on the 21st</p>
<p>Shenzhou News Agency reports that since Germany has been actively preparing for war, it has felt a shortage of manpower and material resources. Therefore, the German government has instructed commercial ships sailing abroad to employ maritime workers from other countries in ports of call. After being concentrated in Germany, they will be assigned to work. The German ships "Hengboli" and "Taibishi" docked in this city and began to recruit Chinese workers to serve as stokers and sailors. After hearing the news, unemployed ship workers scattered in eastern Shanghai rushed to apply. The two ships commissioned Baolong Hospital to examine the workers' bodies. Those who passed the examination were vaccinated and inoculated with cowpox. The hospital examined them on the 16th and 17th of this month. On the 16th, more than 50 people registered for the examination, and 31 passed. These workers were employed by the "Taibishi" ship. Yesterday, more than 40 people registered for the examination, and 32 were selected. They were employed by the "Hengboli" ship. The Shenzhou News Agency reporter asked each worker why they had to leave their hometowns and go abroad to work even though they had maritime skills. They all said that they had been unemployed for a long time and could not maintain their lives. According to the contract signed between the workers and the ship, they must undergo a physical examination first. After passing, they must board the ship to work. The monthly salary is 60-70 yuan. However, there is no salary to take when leaving. They can only receive a salary after being assigned to work in Germany. The return date is set for once every two and a half years. However, there is still the question of whether the workers can be assigned to sail to Shanghai ports in the future. These 63 people are the first batch of recruits. After that, German ships will continue to recruit when they come to Shanghai. Most of the workers who applied this time were from Ningbo and Dinghai and had been working at sea for many years. In addition, this batch of workers will be transported out of the country by German ships on the 21st. According to another source, since last year, Germany has recruited Chinese workers in China once every two months. However, this is the first time they have been directly transported to Germany.</p>
<h3>Robbers Search the Abbot and Pilgrims at Zonghaitang Temple in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Chen Jichao Shot, Treatable; General Temple Lost About Ten Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday was the eighth day of the fourth lunar month of the lunar calendar, commonly known as Buddha's Birthday. Temples and monasteries everywhere were bustling with incense. Even the Zonghaitang Temple at No. 72, Jiazi, West Zhujiawan, Tanziwan, Zhabei, which is as remote, was surprisingly crowded for a while. The abbot held a vegetarian feast to attract pilgrims. Therefore, ordinary men and women, superstitious people, went to offer incense and worship. However, since most of them were common people, the income was very limited. Unexpectedly, it was also coveted by bandits. At around 7:00 PM yesterday, Chen Jichao, the 35-year-old abbot from Yangzhou, was preparing vegetarian dishes to send to the main hall when five men suddenly came outside the hall. One was wearing a black suit, and the rest were wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers. They spoke in various Yangzhou and Northern accents, claiming to be special agents here to search for opium. After speaking, they showed two six-inch pistols, ordering all the men and women in the hall, more than a dozen people, not to move. Three bandits searched everyone, taking away all money and possessions. Thereupon the pilgrims knew they had met bandits, but they had no way to resist, so they had to let the bandits rob them. Finally, the bandits searched the abbot Chen Jichao, seeing that he had three yuan in legal tender, which was the incense money given by the pilgrims. They also robbed him. However, Chen Jichao was reluctant and tried to snatch it back, which angered the bandits. They immediately shot him once, the bullet entering the left chest and exiting to the left side, injuring his left arm. He immediately fell to the ground. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the bandits shouted and fled. All the pilgrims calmed down and rushed to a nearby millet shop to borrow a telephone to report to the Tanziwan sub-station. The patrol officer Luo Siwei immediately led the police to pursue the bandits, but the report was too late to capture them. A bullet casing was found outside the hall and taken back for filing. Chen Jichao, who was injured, was sent to Renji Hospital by medical director No. 1622. Fortunately, the injury was not serious. After bandaging, he was discharged from the hospital and returned home to heal himself. The situation was reported to the General Bureau, and the case was ordered to be tracked down. The total loss was only about ten yuan.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Tanjiaqiao Silk Weaving Factory Resolved</h3>
<p>Factory Acknowledges Three Demands</p>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Yan Shao-chen, the patrol officer at Post No. 52 of the Tanjiaqiao Police Station of the Xinzha Police Branch in Zhabei, learned that the workers of the Tanjiaqiao Silk Weaving Factory were gathering at the Shixin Silk Weaving Factory for a meeting. Officer Yan immediately reported to the station by telephone. Patrol Officer Yang Chunran dispatched Sergeant Shi Ruilan to lead many police officers to suppress the meeting. They saw more than 200 workers discussing the conditions, but the order was very good, so they did not interfere at the time. As a result, the workers decided on three demands: ① If the factory has no work to do for two days, the factory must subsidize the workers' meal expenses by 30 cents; ② If workers do not ask for leave for half a month, the factory must reward them with 50 cents; ③ Weavers use private rulers and request to switch to municipal rulers. According to the police officers' report, the owner of Shixin Factory, Di Zhisheng, acknowledged the above three items, and the work resumption was resolved immediately. After receiving the report, Patrol Officer Yang, in addition to reporting to the Xinzha Branch, still ordered the police officer at Post No. 52 to pay attention to reconnaissance and dispatched patrol police to protect the area.</p>
<h3>Five Packages of Morphine Seized at Pier No. 9 of the Bund</h3>
<p>Multiple Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM yesterday, at Pier No. 9 of the Bund in Nanshi, the Municipal Police and Water Patrol Team seized a "tiger-cart" loaded with four bags of lime, containing five packages of morphine, weighing about 40 taels, worth nearly a thousand yuan. The carter Lin Heshang, the transporter Bei A'er, 26 years old, from Haimen, resident of No. 1, Qianjie Street in front of the Great King Temple, and the suspect Lin A'fa were all detained and brought to the bureau.

When he saw a black-plated car causing trouble at the intersection, surrounded by many people, he also stopped the car. Unexpectedly, the person who caused the trouble took the opportunity to point out that the old woman was injured by the Xiang Sheng car. The crowd was not convinced. Then, the nearby guard policeman stepped forward, stopped the black-plated car, obtained a prosecutor's business card, copied down the driver's name and car number, brought them to the bureau for reporting. The injured old woman was immediately sent to Shanghai South Hospital for treatment, her injuries were not serious, and she was still conscious, but due to her old age and weakness, it would depend on whether there would be any changes.</p>

<h3>Fire at British-owned Longmao Warehouse in Lujiazui</h3>
<p>At 9:50 AM yesterday, a fire broke out on the lower floor of warehouse No. 37 of the British-owned Longmao Warehouse in Lujiazui, Pudong. Female workers were sorting cotton when, for unknown reasons, a fire suddenly started in a pile of white cotton. The white cotton belonged to Yixing Huahang of this port, consisting of 150 bales in wooden clamps, with 75 bales already opened, a total of 242 bales, with 120 bales already opened, and 38 small sample bales, with 15 bales already opened. At that time, except for the unopened bales, which were undamaged because they were placed at the southern end, all the opened bales were affected. The female workers rushed out of the warehouse, causing considerable disorder. The warehouse used its own water pump to tightly close the warehouse door, break the glass on the windows, and spray water inside. However, the fire intensified. After half an hour of attempts to put it out, they were unsuccessful, so they telegraphed various agencies for assistance. Soon, the Pudong Fire Brigade and the Customs Pujie Fire Boat arrived, opened the warehouse door, and a firefighter wearing protective gear entered and specifically overturned the burning cotton, using several water pumps to concentrate water power for vigorous extinguishing. Countless amounts of water were poured on the fire. It was not until 10:30 AM that the fire was completely extinguished. After inspection, it was found that all the opened white cotton, weighing 30,000 catties, was half burned and the remainder was soaked in water. The estimated loss was about 10,050 yuan. There were various rumors about the cause of the fire, and the truth is still unclear. It is said that the owner had a large amount of insurance on the goods.</p>
<h3>Impeccably Dressed and Well-Mannered, Turns Out to Be an Experienced Thief</h3>
<p>Breaks into a Hotel Room to Steal / Attempted Suicide After Fingerprints Were Verified</p>
<p>He Qing from Henan checked into Room 93 of the Jue Lu Hotel at 250 Yu Qiaqing Road around 2:00 AM on the 15th of this month. Unexpectedly, at 3:30 AM, he climbed over the balcony from the window and entered Room 94, occupied by Feng Yiyin and others, intending to steal property. After being discovered by Feng, He immediately fled back to his own room. The tea attendants apprehended him and turned him over to the Lao Zha Police Station. Hua Detective Shan Zhaoxian investigated, but He completely denied the theft. He claimed to be employed by the National Government, had just arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing, and because it was late, it was inconvenient to return home, so he checked into a hotel temporarily. He also claimed to live in a certain place in the French Concession. At that time, the detectives saw that He was wearing a luxurious Western suit and his manner was unusually generous, so they suspected he was not a thief. Therefore, they investigated the information he provided. Unexpectedly, the results of the investigation were completely false. After sending his fingerprints to the fingerprint department for verification, it was discovered that He was indeed an experienced thief. In the past few years, he had been sentenced to imprisonment for eight months, one year, and one and a half years by the First and Second Special District Courts for theft cases. His claim to be a high-ranking official of the National Government was completely false. He was immediately taken into custody. Unexpectedly, at this time, He suddenly took out a Western knife made from a razor blade from his pocket and stabbed himself in the neck, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, the detectives quickly snatched it away, only causing superficial wounds with no major harm. Yesterday, he was sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the previous situation, stating that the case still needed to be investigated, so he requested a postponement of the trial. Judge Feng Shide approved the request, ordered him to be detained, and rescheduled the interrogation.</p>
<h3>Huishan Police Crack Theft Case and Trace the Source of the Gun</h3>

During the postponed investigation, it was found that Gong Mao was not related to the case and she was released first. The court approved it.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Sues for Annulment of Marriage After Discovering Husband is Deaf-Mute</h3>
<p>Married in Chaozhou to Avoid Attention of Relatives and Friends / Defendant Raises Jurisdictional Issues and Fails to Appear</p>
<p>Zheng Xihua, a 20-year-old Chaozhou woman residing at No. 3, Jingmingli, Fuyou Road, Xinkai River, retained lawyers Yuan Yang'an and Dai Ningrui to sue her deaf-mute husband Chen Huanzhen (18 years old, residing at No. 8, Yong'anli, Xueyuan Road, Chengnan) in the local court to annul their marriage. The main points of her complaint stated that the plaintiff was betrothed to the defendant in 1916 by her parents and a matchmaker. At that time, she was still a young girl and knew nothing about such matters. It was not until after the marriage was consummated in January of last year that she learned that the defendant was a deaf-mute child under the age of sixteen, and furthermore, was暴戾成性, relying on his wealth to bully others. Even during the honeymoon period, he would resort to violent beatings over trivial matters. The plaintiff was unable to bear the abuse and had no choice but to seek refuge in her mother's home. Although the defendant is now nominally eighteen years old, he was born in 1920, which means he is actually seventeen years old and has not yet reached full age. According to Articles 980 and 989 of the Civil Code, a man who has not reached the age of eighteen is not allowed to marry, and reaching this age is grounds for annulment. The defendant failed to appear after being summoned on a scheduled date, and submitted a statement raising jurisdictional issues, claiming that it was under the jurisdiction of Chaoyang. Therefore, the plaintiff further stated in her rejoinder that the defendant and his father had been living in Shanghai for many years. His father runs Yonghe Pawnshop on Yong'an Street and Guangchang Department Store on Tianzhutang Street, so Shanghai is the base of life for the defendant and his father. The ancestral home in their hometown is just a family estate. The marriage took place in their hometown because the defendant was deaf-mute and disabled, so they hastily held the ceremony in the remote countryside to avoid the trouble of relatives and friends in Shanghai. Moreover, it was only for three months, so there is no question of jurisdiction. Therefore, Judge Chen Weicheng held another hearing yesterday. The defendant still did not appear. Lawyer Yuan Yang'an stated that the defendant grew up in Shanghai and had made Shanghai his permanent place of residence, relying on his father's life. The defendant's father is the owner of Yonghe Pawnshop on Yong'an Street, which has been in operation for more than thirty years, and also runs Guangchang Department Store. As for the marriage in Chaozhou, it was because the defendant was only sixteen years old, also deaf and mute, also short and small. If they were to get married in Shanghai, there would be many relatives and friends who would consider it indecorous, so they went to Chaozhou to get married. The court rescheduled the trial for another date.</p>
<h3>Two Russians Sue Over Jointly Operated Amon Theater</h3>
<p>Bailuo Lidao (transliteration), 87 years old this year, and two fellow countrymen, Yajielike (transliteration), rented the former site of the Moonlight Grand Theater on Bair Road, French Concession, in December of last year to open the Amon Cinema. Lidao provided the capital, and Yajielike served as the manager. After operating for a short period, the theater closed due to losses and has recently been reorganized. Lidao has now filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Yajielike of defrauding him of money, and filed an incidental civil suit, requesting the court to order the defendant to return the capital of 1,700 yuan and losses of 2,300 yuan. Judge Qiu Huandao summoned the parties to the Criminal Division No. 2 yesterday morning. The plaintiff's lawyer, who was Russian, appeared on his behalf, stating that in December of last year, the plaintiff and defendant jointly opened the Amon Cinema, agreeing that the plaintiff would provide the capital and the defendant would act as manager. The plaintiff first paid the defendant 1,700 yuan as start-up capital. On the 20th of that month, the plaintiff was injured by a car and treated in the hospital. All the theater affairs were handled by the defendant. Unexpectedly, on January 15th of this year, the defendant used a typewriter to type out a share transfer agreement and took advantage of the plaintiff's confusion to have the plaintiff sign it. The plaintiff only discovered that he had been fooled after signing it. The defendant had already transferred the plaintiff's shares to someone surnamed Yan for 9,000 yuan. In addition to being swindled out of the paid-in capital, the plaintiff suffered a total loss of 2,300 yuan. Please judge the defendant according to law. The defendant argued that when the plaintiff signed the agreement, his lawyer was also present. The defendant lost 8,000 gold in running the theater. The plaintiff transferred the shares to Yan, causing the defendant to suffer losses that he could not recover. He requested that the court declare him innocent. The court verified the confessions and ordered the parties to make their arguments, then declared the case closed and awaited judgment.</p>
<h3>Kang Qikai Violates Regulations by Not Having a License</h3>

<h3>Theft at New Site of Lawyers Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association had its original site at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Rue Belles in the French Concession. At the end of last year, Yijian Building was built, and Enterprise Construction Factory won the bid to construct it. The reason was that Chen, the manager of the construction factory, died of a sudden illness when the Second Zha Engineering was completed, so the construction project was stopped. After negotiations back and forth, a few days ago, the Lawyers Association sent members such as Xu Zuoliang and Chen Tingrui to the site to take inventory of all the engineering materials that had been abandoned halfway. A theft occurred at the site late the night before last, and the thieves stole more than forty steel bars that were left at the site. The thieves were spotted by a patrolling police officer while they were hiring a cart to transport the materials. The police officer thought that transporting materials from the site at night was suspicious, so he detained both the people and the stolen goods and took them to the Lujia Gong Police Station. The head of the police station learned about the theft and summoned the watchmen from the site to the police station. They identified the stolen goods and the thieves, so the thieves were taken into custody and will be sent to the court for interrogation.</p>

<h3>A Note on Mr. Ma Yudan</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Since the government has been working hard on domestic construction, the import of machinery has been increasing year by year. To increase production, it is necessary to purchase as much imported machinery as possible. This principle of "good work" must first have "good tools" is something that all construction workers agree on. However, I believe that purchasing foreign goods to produce goods will not fundamentally solve the problems that construction wants to solve. The benefits of production are not yet visible, but the outflow of profits is already clear. The fundamental way to build is to cultivate manufacturing talents? The manufacture of machinery requires, first, raw materials, and second, talents. China is not short of raw materials, but lacks talents. Is it better to take care of it ourselves, take and seek what we want, rather than entrusting goods to the land and begging for help from others?</p>
<p>Medicine is the crystallization of science. Since the art of electrotherapy has become clear in modern times, the use of machinery has become more widespread. However, electrotherapy equipment is all imported, and the annual outflow is even greater. If we take the tools for saving lives from others, once the source is cut off, we will be at a loss. The danger is not only the outflow of funds. I have often been deeply concerned about the lack of electrotherapy equipment manufacturing talents. Recently, I have found Mr. Ma Yudan. Mr. Ma Yudan is a high-achieving student of the Aurora Medical College. When I was a teacher at the school, I saw that Mr. Ma was intelligent and eager to learn, with extraordinary talents. In addition to studying medicine, he was devoted to the work of electrical appliance manufacturing, and he did not hesitate to study all electrotherapy equipment. At first, he gave away many electric soldering irons he made to his classmates. Then, he felt that the application of electrotherapy equipment was the most widespread with shortwave diathermy machines. Practicing doctors almost have one in hand. However, imported goods are expensive, bulky, and difficult to carry. He concentrated on research and was determined to improve. The cost of what he made was low, only half of that of foreign goods, and the style was exquisite, not exceeding a handbag. However, its heating power was not lighter due to its size. Electrocautery and electrocoagulation did not reduce the function of imported goods. It can also use static electricity and is not limited to alternating current. It can be carried to the homes of patients and can also be used in the interior where there is a lack of lighting equipment. It can be said that it is a magical use of technology! Mr. Ma is about to graduate this summer. I often advise him to use his full power to manufacture on a large scale. To present him, or perhaps it should be noted by medical doctors who are engaged in medical construction?</p>

<p>— Chu Jinfang</p>
<p>Three, Nanjing Municipal Health Office</p>
<p>The hygiene work in Nanjing City began after the National Government established its capital there. In May 1932, the Hygiene Bureau was abolished, and the Hygiene Office was established, directly under the Nanjing Municipal Government, to handle all hygiene-related matters in the city.

<h3>Throwing Child into River</h3>
<p>— Yu Gao</p>
<p>Social tragedies are constantly happening. In every corner, big or small, across the country, hardly a day or moment passes without lives being destroyed and lost. Yet, because the existence of these people is always forgotten, it fails to attract the attention of others. In Sichuan, thousands of disaster victims are starving to death every day, while people living in Shanghai can still "turn a blind eye" and continue their extravagant and decadent lives. That's the reason.</p>
<p>But the reason doesn't stop there. Chinese society has never known how to respect human life. In the past, autocratic emperors could execute their ministers with inhuman tortures such as dismemberment and beheading. The rebel Zhang Xianzhong killed several million people when he entered Sichuan. The thought of this still makes people shudder. Yet, even in this modern and civilized age, aren't large numbers of outstanding young people being led into terrible slaughterhouses like sacrificial lambs? Initially, these bright red bloodstains might attract people's attention, but over time, the impression of tragedy becomes too frequent, and the shadow gradually fades. It is said that this is not intentional, but rather has a physiological cause. The human senses become gradually numb to the same external phenomena after too many stimuli. If you want to restore it, you have to strengthen the stimulation. For example, in this society, there are four or five suicides every day. Newspapers cram these unfortunate victims' stories together, and people become too accustomed to seeing them, so they ignore them. But if you want to attract their attention, it's not impossible. That is, the suicide's means of seeking death must be exceptionally tragic, using excessive self-harm to awaken people's ordinary senses. For example, someone previously jumped from the third floor of the Great World with his wife and children, their blood bright red, their bodies a mess, which briefly attracted people's attention. Newspapers wrote about it one after another, considering it a very serious social problem. But how shockingly enormous was the sacrifice of the dead!</p>
<p>I happened to see a news item in various newspapers: "A Cantonese woman, Qian Zhushi, has a two-year-old son. Her husband is a laborer. Recently, due to financial difficulties and a lack of livelihood, she suddenly had thoughts of ending her life. Yesterday, at about 10 a.m., she took her son to the bank of the Suzhou River near Jiangxi Road Bridge. Taking advantage of a moment when people weren't paying attention, she jumped into the river. Fortunately, she was rescued and did not drown."</p>
<p>Driven by economic hardship, throwing oneself and one's child into the river has become a common sight in this society, nothing out of the ordinary. Yet behind this extreme ordinariness lies a great tragedy, which people won't think about. Yes! Who tells it to be too ordinary to attract people's attention?</p>
<h3>Sorrow of Life</h3>
<p>— Tianshe</p>
<p>Because of my route, I inevitably have to pass through the noisy, crowded, damp, and muddy vegetable market every morning on my way to work. But these things can be endured, as long as I get through that area, it will be quiet. What I find most difficult to endure and what is deeply imprinted on my mind and not easily forgotten is a kind of deathly stimulation: the large vat at the entrance of the chicken and duck shop, the vat full of ochre-colored blood, the surface covered with broken chicken and duck feathers, the smooth, clean white bodies of chickens and ducks hanging upside down on iron hooks, their necks stretched so long, with faint traces of blood seeping from the slits where they were cut. The blood of these pitiful creatures has congealed into clumps, immersed in buckets for sale. Their internal organs have all been dug out and piled in bamboo baskets for people to use as appetizers.</p>
<p>And in the pork shops, the employees, whether to show that their livestock are fresh or to deliberately give me some kind of deathly terror, always have a bloody pig's head hanging on the pillar at the door. Sometimes the eyes are wide open, as if they can't die in peace; sometimes the eyelids are closed, still showing a pitiful expression at the moment of death. There is also one or two pig lungs, densely covered with tiny blood vessels, the place where the trachea is broken spurting white foam. At a glance, you can tell that the lungs are healthy. When I, who have a suspicion of early lung disease, see this scene, I immediately feel difficulty breathing, and my chest seems to have a hidden pain. Because of the momentary sensation in my nerves: it's as if my own lungs have been hung out. But my own lungs are unhealthy. So, I lower my head.</p>
<p>I once suffered from a severe coughing and spitting blood illness. My vegetarian aunt, out of excessive love for me, also cruelly told me a simple recipe: "Use pig lungs to nourish human lungs." While the pig lungs that have just been taken from the chest are still hot, stuff one or two dozen Sichuan fritillaries into the trachea, boil them until they are soft, chop them up, and eat them lightly. It is said to be extremely effective. But I finally thanked her for her good intentions but did not follow the recipe. This kind of "taking the strengths of things to make up for one's own weaknesses," a recipe that borders on selfishness, I have certainly heard of many times, such as eating pig brains to help the weak and forgetful brain, eating pig kidneys for kidney deficiency and lower back pain, eating tendons for poor leg strength, soft-shelled turtle and turtle shell for nourishing yin, and young chickens for supplementing deficiency and loss. Such incredible "magical remedies" for treating illness, are they beneficial or harmful? It's still an unknown number, but the first to suffer the misfortune of being slaughtered are those livestock who, like humans, have life and consciousness. Some time ago, there were horrifying incidents of "boiling babies alive" and "sucking boys' essence." Could these be "progressive" and "taking the strengths of others to make up for one's own weaknesses"? However, the cruelty of certain humans becomes all the more apparent here.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Zikai's "Protecting Life Drawings" is one of the books that I often reread. Although each picture is only a few simple strokes, without embellishment or exaggeration, the stimulating feeling towards the fate of living beings and the state of death has deeply aroused the sorrow in my heart. What the pictures portray is the same as what I see in the vegetable market: a batch of ducks hanging on iron hooks, with the caption "Exposing Corpses"; a bloody pig's head, with the caption "Commanding Order." The former reminds me of the tragedies that have happened to humans themselves, such as "Great Fire," "Broadcasting Cars," "Overturning Boats," and "Famine." The latter reminds me of the horror of prisoners being beheaded and their heads hung at the gate of the city as a warning to the public. Humans, just like other living beings, have the possibility of suffering the most perverse murderous intentions.</p>
<p>However, death by blade, death by fire and water, death by disaster, is still tangible, and if tangible, one can still win a little sympathy in words or writing. It's just that a group of people who are constantly tormented by a life of suffering, selling sweat and blood, and also having to let others suck their fat, are slowly drying up, slowly dying, without a trace of a wound to be found. Although before they die, they may have experienced fatigue and illness, they still struggle in fatigue and illness, without giving up working, struggling for "life," but the result of the struggle cannot escape death. Where exactly is the meaning of life? From livestock to a portion of humanity, and to oneself among humanity, there is the same sorrow of life.</p>
<p>Ms. Zhou Lianxia, from Jiangxi province, is skilled in calligraphy and painting, and especially knowledgeable in poetry. From the 15th to the 17th of this month, the Chinese Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association will hold its fourth exhibition on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Tongxiang Association on Yu Qiaqing Road. Ms. Zhou will participate in the exhibition with many outstanding masterpieces.</p>

<h3>Night Walk</h3>
<p>— Liang Qijun</p>
<p>—— One of the "Paradise" Intuitions</p>
<p>Pulling my felt hat low to my eyebrows, I began to walk quickly across the stone bridge. The continuous spring rain that had been falling for five days was still continuing. The streets were so muddy that people were constantly in danger of slipping. ...</p>
<p>"You should take a good rest. Why don't you stay here for the night on this dark night with a gentle breeze and slanting rain?"</p>
<p>My friend's caring words seemed to be ringing in my ears again.</p>
<p>I refused his kindness. — I have always cared little about this kind of delicate thought. I don't know what good it does to nourish the body until it is plump and white. I only understand how to love my life and my work.</p>
<p>"No, let me get rained on. I also want to learn from the willow trees and sprout some tender green shoots. — It's spring."</p>
<p>"Spring?..."</p>
<p>My friend was immersed in the bewitchment of astonished surprise. He covered his face with both hands and sighed. ...</p>
<p>So, I quietly walked out, quietly walking my road in the muddy rainy night.</p>
<p>Along the river, several small boats and rows of bamboo rafts were tightly squeezed together. The black, transparent river water quietly brushed past the sides of the boats. I don't know what was causing the bamboo rafts to creak.</p>
<p>The splashing of the oars of the night boats gradually faded away. But loneliness was replaced by murmured whispers and low sighs.</p>
<p>On the riverbank, there were piles of rubble, bamboo branches, tree stumps, and a bundle of thin firewood, as if some terrible thing was crouching behind them, ready to jump out and grab people. A hunched figure, holding a dim and tiny lamp, crawled out of the cabin and deliberately pretended to cough. ...</p>
<p>Rainwater hung from the brim of my hat, and I let it lie on my cheek. My shirt was wet, and my steps were now slow and tired.</p>
<p>Although I know to grit my teeth and live on until the day of death that is beyond human control, the too-long, hopeless gray days have almost made me forget even the instinct to get angry.</p>
<p>My life has placed my numb body in a small county town called "Paradise," and five months have passed. — Five months as bland as a bowl of unsalted greens, with a bit of a bitter taste.</p>
<p>At the beginning, I still childishly used the same enthusiasm and caution as a gold panner, searching in every corner for the origin of the name "Paradise." Maybe I could find some seeds of joy there. But this Paradise, which resembles a bankrupt household, has changed. I have never once said with satisfaction:</p>
<p>"That's Paradise."</p>
<p>Every day, a small newspaper uses two large sheets of paper to record the news of Paradise.</p>
<p>— Paradise? Hell?</p>
<p>Such doubt is by no means without reason. —</p>
<p>Filling the paper are: disputes between men and women, accusations of abandonment and adultery; shocking actions of tyrannical lake bandits, assassinations, robberies, abductions; rent collection, disturbances, conflicts with the police, bloodshed; opium offenders; private prostitutes;...</p>
<p>A traveling reporter wrote in a playful tone in his dispatch: "I have seen everything in Paradise, but I am very sorry to ask you to forgive me. I'm sorry that I can't tell you anything besides 'old' and 'antiquated'."</p>
<p>The days of Paradise flow by like a sluggish and turbid river. Spring, is reflecting the oily sheen of the gorgeous sunlight, floating on the murky black river surface.</p>
<p>The rain soaked my shirt, and from time to time, the cold made me shiver. Water droplets dripped from the brim of my hat onto my face, and then dripped down to the ground from my trouser legs along with my body.</p>
<p>Dark night, cold rain, boundless loneliness and sorrow, but I believe my heart is warm. — I long for a clear and bright spring.</p>
<h3>Fragments of Night</h3>
<p>— Wang Rendong</p>
<p>Window</p>
<p>Night, boundless silence.</p>
<p>The flame of the lamp flickers: a depressed flower. However, the surrounding darkness densely pervades — netting it; not allowing it to bloom. Like a will-o'-the-wisp frozen in a deep valley. Like the powerless silent emerald green of a dying firefly. Like a line of poetry in the heart of the depressed.</p>
<p>The wooden-framed window has no paper: the night wind is soughing.</p>
<p>Outside the window is a maple tree, soughing in the night wind. Memory tells me: it once had blood-red leaves. However, it has turned black as a bird in the night. Although my blurred eyes have seen some red eyes like those of a mad dog, they immediately disappeared, disappeared.</p>
<p>Only the boundless night, boundless silence.</p>
<p>The lamp flame stretches the shadows of my father and me and sticks them to the empty wall. Like a silhouette.</p>
<p>Father sits with his hands cupped, head bowed, in silence.</p>
<p>Occasionally there is a long, deep sigh — when he raises his head and sees the silence outside the window.</p>
<p>Boundless depression has exhausted him.</p>
<p>I am also silent: but one nightmare after another crawls.</p>
<p>Although depression also suffocates me, a string of many, very long lonely, miserable laughs has repeatedly tried to creep out of my heart in secret.</p>
<p>After my eyes became blurred, the red eyes of the mad dog also disappeared.</p>
<p>In the room, outside the window: silence shrinks densely.</p>
<p>The lamp flame freezes.</p>
<p>What remains is a heavy piece of night.</p>
<p>Will-o'-the-wisp</p>
<p>(A will-o'-the-wisp is like a lamp flame blooming in the depressed night)</p>
<p>Night.</p>
<p>Under the skinny trees, several of us watching will-o'-the-wisps sit silently on the hillside.</p>
<p>We are waiting for the emerald green will-o'-the-wisps to appear in that distant, deep black forest.</p>
<p>Night and terror are kneaded into one.</p>
<p>(Terror will crawl onto the heart of the will-o'-the-wisp, but it cannot cover the eyes of those who watch it.)</p>
<p>Beside me is a stone tablet: I lean against it and can hide from some of the sharp wind. It makes my hands ice cold. As if I am touching a dead heart. But, if I leave my hand on it for a long time, I transmit the inner madness to it.</p>
<p>The other children who came with me squeeze silently beside me, and night and terror have also kneaded us into one.</p>
<p>We have a common expectation.</p>
<p>In that distance: is a deeper blackness. From memory, we know that there are many graves on that side. — Where there are many graves, there are many will-o'-the-wisps.</p>
<p>From the place of those piled-up graves will appear the will-o'-the-wisps that we expect.</p>
<p>The skinny trees are like silent sentinels on the lookout. When the night wind comes, they sway soughingly: they stir up the silence that night and terror have kneaded into one. — This is a warning.</p>
<p>We squeeze even closer together.</p>
