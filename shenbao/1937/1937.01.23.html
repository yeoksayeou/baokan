<p>諸君、今晚兄弟所要講的是怎樣救亡圖存、所謂救亡圖存、是因為亡國之禍就在眼前、我們要想什麽方法來救他、亡國之禍所以迫在眼前、因為內憂外患重重交迫、先說外患、如九一八之後、先失東三省、後失熱河、其間還有淞滬之戰、長城各口之戰、察北冀東以及河北都處在極惡的環境、這樣的鯨吞蠶食、可使中國陷於滅亡，再說內憂、共匪所到、民生塗炭、由江西·而湖南·而貴州·而雲南·而四川·以至陝甘、這樣的所至糜爛、也可使中國陷於滅亡、以上二者、有一於此、已為亡國之禍、何况這二者好像有了密約、將兩把刀由兩條路殺人、如今更漸漸合攏起來了呢、有人說、與其亡於外人、不如亡於共匪、須知亡總是一樣的、我們不要坐視其亡、而要救亡、有人說，蘇俄行了共產、何嘗亡國、須知蘇俄的國家環境、與我國全然不同、革命時候也與我國全然不同、而且除了蘇俄之外、歐洲有些國家、想行共產、無不陷於危亡、大戰後的匈牙利、因為想行共產、被羅馬尼亞打入京城、諸君總還記得、所以大戰后勝利的意大利、一度共產騷擾之後、趕緊便有法西斯來抵制他、大戰失敗的德意志、－度北產騷擾之後、趕緊便有國社黨來抵制他、西班牙還不算實行共產、祗不過接近共產，已經發生大亂、亂事結果、尚未可知、眼前已將西班牙割成兩塊、而且瑪德里京城巳經粉碎了、由此種種看來、不特中國目前實行共產，可以亡國、卽使接近共匪、受其操縱、也足以引起大亂、而至於亡、數年以來、中國在這內憂外患重重交迫之中、苦苦掙扎顧得肅清內憂、便顧不得捍禦外患、顧得捍禦外患、便顧不得肅清內憂、數年以來政府人民、陷於這個夾攻的形勞之中、焦頭爛額、眞是說不出的苦痛、在這樣夾攻的形勞之中、要想出方法、打開一條生路、是很不容易的、數年以來、積了無數苦痛的經驗、方纔定出一個救亡圖存之整個的計劃和一定的步驟、尤其是一年以來、這個計劃和步驟、已經着着的向前進、為舉國所一致認識了、如果這個計劃和步驟、沒有意外阻撓的話、我們相信在最短期間、內憂可以告一結束、因為共匪竄至陝甘以後、漸漸窮蹙、人所共知、如其洗心革面、不難就範、否則只有歸於消減、中國可以全力對外、無復內顧之憂了、想不到忽然有去年十二月十二日的西安事變、更想不到蔣委員長平安回京以後、還有一部份軍隊負隅抗命、甚至赤化的舉動這樣一來、內憂愈加複雜、外患也愈加猖獗、我們如今講到救亡圖存、卑無高論惟有誠心呼籲、全國民衆、認清環境、立定腳跟、仍向着救亡圖存之整個的計劃和一定的步驟做去、萬不可為共匪所搖惑、中了他挑撥離間的毒計因為救亡圖存之計劃和步驟、雖然條理萬端、總括起來、不外“對外要保衛國土”、“對內要團結民衆”、的兩個口號、這兩個口號、如今為共匪所偵悉、而假藉之以行其挑撥離間的毒計了、先就“保衛國土”來說我們只看最近的綏遠守土禦寇、已經有了相當的進展、這種進展、不是容易得來的、自從淞滬長城兩次戰役之後、政府及人民、深深感覺到種種缺乏、相與不斷努力、從事補救、一面忍耐、一面加緊工作、方繼得到這個進展、中央當局的領導、地方當局的同心合力、全國人民的一致後盾、都在這次表現出來、而在這吃緊的時候、忽然的最高統帥、幾蒙不測、忽然的地方割據、又將重演、後方及側面、有此搖動、前線亦因之徬徨、這是何等苦痛的事呢、這種舉動、明明是分裂國土、而共匪却偏要假藉抗戰的名義、以保衛國土之名、而行分裂國土之實再就“團結民衆”來說、自國難發生以來、由國難會議以至最近籌備中的國民大會、都是團結民衆的表現、我們必須知道團結民衆、惟有國民黨才做得來、决不是共黨能做得來、何以呢、國民黨是以國民革命為目的的、所謂國民革命、是求整個國家整個民族之生存及其發達、故以整個國家整個民族的共同利害為基礎、而求其團結、于理於勢、均是必然的、共產黨是以階級鬥爭寫目的、主張以－個階級打倒其他各階級、故拆散人民的聯合戰線、也是於理於勢均是必然的、試看當全國一致守土禦寇的時候、忽然的從中操縱、使同在國民革命軍旗幟下的部隊、發生裂痕、使同在中華民國國旗下之領土、發生裂痕、這便是拆散人民的聯合戰線的一個極大證據、而共匪却又偏要假藉“人民陣線”的名義、以團結民衆之名，而行拆散民衆之實、兄弟剛才所說挑撥離間的毒計、卽此可見、兄弟以為我們今日若要救亡圖存、惟有依原定計劃與步驟、努力做去、以期其實現、而期其實現、惟有全國民衆以全力為政府之後盾、無貳心、無歧途、沉着勇敢猛向前進、使挑撥離間之毒計無所施展、使懷有野心乘時割據之企圖、無所發生、這樣方纔可以肅清內憂、這樣方纔可以捍禦外患、目前救亡圖存之要着、莫大於此、（二十二日中央社電）</p>

<h3>潼洛鋒車記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　明心</p>
<p>洛陽之行，逗留晨夕，略采風物，載之於篇·漸知由洛西行，日有－車，可至潼關，因决計附之以行。以待車晚發，復得清暇，則條與思古之幽情，出游龍門白馬寺，此二得各踞洛邑二十余里，一由南行，一則東向也。南行出西門，先過西宮，卽中原重鎮之所在，興築甚鉅，儲械亦豐，事關軍秘，不更觀縷。卽涉洛水，過天津橋，（邵康節詩天津橋上杜鵑啼者卽此（橋為舊築，不勝載重，現方別搆新橋於其左，基脚均已敷就，計時可以完成。橋卽康節舊居之安樂窩，至今子姓多居於是，世德緜延，足以風已。進為關林，卽關侯被害後函首見還之塚地，古柏紅墻，殿宇翼然，容冬方由劉峙主持重修者，少一留覽，漁至龍門。龍門方修一新橋，尚未完工，而規制宏偉，足供軍事之需。龍門山本緜亘，得大禹氏盤之，俾通伊水，斷岸夾江，是調伊闕。龍門石刻僅後於雲崗數十年，而毀損過之，無山不有小窟，亦幾無窟不空，斷脰折足，比比皆是，千餘年前之文物，盡供市儈之斧斤，彌可慨嘆。近者競言存古，而卽此殘餘猶有最近為人盜去者，典守有職，將何以善其後乎，信此數年，可以只有石窟而無佛像也。其最偉最巨者，為半山之九閒殿，蓋武后嘗於此營別殿以避暑者。大佛高至五丈許，尚復完善，其對岸香山寺，卽白香山故居，亦其葬所，身後捨宅為寺，現亦頹毀不堪。漸遵道北歸，轉出東門，至白馬寺，先過東門，卽見孔子入周問禮樂之碑，東周文物，令人深夢奠之思，前為夾馬營，朱太祖誕生之所，太祖以忠厚開基，而杯酒釋兵權，尤為千秋以降，安內之美談，思之思之，邈乎不可及已。更進卽白馬寺，久遭渝毀，近者始得諸大善信發心重修，雖規模仍不安敞，石刻嚴遠不過金天禧時者。此此炎漢古利，東來大法之初基，而頹廢至此，弘法者宜更有以冒明之。寺前卽舍利塔，建制特古，作四方形，自漢以來，屢經修葺，迄今尚兀立雲表，古德摩勝竺法蘭兩聖僧馱經遠至者，亦葬寺內，躉草一歲，未見碑碣也</p>
<p>由洛而潼關凡二百二十五公里，車行八小時，沿途約略可記者。金谷園站，為石祟故趾，荒烟衰草，墜樓之跡，一不可尋，澠池為秦王擊缶處，具見當白交鄰之道，殊合於今日平等立塲之精義。迨至潼關，左為雄鎮，右帶黃河，氣象萬千，關門聳峙，而頹壞特甚，車站尚停有鐵甲車多輛，蓋均在後方待命者。城內幹路修直分為東南西北四街，東大街多商肆，南大街多糧行花行，壁上則多紅綠紙標語，有日楊虎城為陝西之公敵，有日張學良為勇於改過之好漢，有日與匪接近，留心受騙，有日集中國力，方可對外，於此四項，卽是覘政治軍事之動問矣。</p>
<p>城內駐軍不多，蓋各軍受命，多已分赴前方配備完全，惟前方各軍多有留守辦事處，設於城內，加以負守衛警備之資者，似此彈丸之地，街市已覺戎裝者多於便衣，惟近來軍人訓育日佳，故市民相習初不覺有絲毫之驚惶，且復因而振興市面，貿易轉繁，飯館多軍裝者，或一人據案，或三五會食，應價付資，絕無要索，記者冷眼旁觀，知國家之有進步，於此可以覘之。軍士亦多明大義，識事理，當與接席者一談，則日軍士效命，初無他言，惟一舉手，－投足，何莫非國家之資源元氣，倘能化乖戾為祥和，絕共匪而得對方之悔禍，則吾懠復員以移駐北向，勇氣寫不更且百倍乎。兵士官佐南北籍貫均有之，尤愛談百靈朝戰役之盛，以為雖未身參茲役，而得諸電訊，我武維揚，信此當前，不難而固金甌，振我鼓顰，乃獨惜夫棧節之橫生也。</p>
<p>至於此間軍事布置，以事涉機秘，未容盡寡，華縣前卽赤水，逾水卽渭南，為東北一○五師劉多荃等所部也。劉部本在華縣，事變旣起，此間前方即往圍攻華縣以蕞爾土城，自難固守，劉部因卽退去，域內所幸尚未大受損傷，於今箭已在絃而懸岸未始不可勒馬，則竚視政治上之運用，以及對方悔禍之有無辦法耳。山西安至此，電話電報通而又斷，最近更不許人民之通過，然仍有少數得以賦歸，據稱共軍確有參加，惟為數不多，目前對於人民，尚未大施刦掠，至楊部於事變之際，秩序騒然，隴海被扣之新到藍鋼車兩列，非特盡加毀損，亦且將車內絨椅臥具破舖率行取去，兵士懸絨毯於槍尖，沿街叫賣，每條僅值數角，甚至將車座之絨墊，亦以刺刀劊下者，可謂極破壞之能事矣。</p>
<p>潼關城內，人民熙攘，一如往日，小販沿街零售食物布疋之屬，不絕於途，華北飯店為此間翹楚，座客常滿，而城內古跡，如馬超刺曹操時中樹一槍，操得兔脫，槍穴猶在其樹，至今不枯，在東大街中，復興藥材行內者，兵士往觀，肩摩穀擊，又關帝廟之大區，其文字觀之，忽作陰文，忽作陽文者，（此必是日光反映之故，本地人傳為神物）亦復多人往觀，至關西書院。為漢時楊家不受遺金，以為天知地知人知我知之遺跡，則知者較少，非少有頭巾氣者，不暇往尋慎獨之遺躅矣。城內有戲院一，茅舍土階，演陜西梆子，門前冷落，而對門之郵局電局，則房屋本不宏敞，滙欵寄信者紛至沓來，亦均戎裝佩劍之沐，擁擠已極，拆字繕函之單，卽於屋前空院列案售書，亦復生涯鼎盛，足　上慰菽水，下養妻學，人同此心，陌頭柳色，自昔有然矣。（十八日潼關發）</p>

<h3>統一救國之意義</h3>
<p>— 高</p>
<p>統一救國。為新近蔚起之呼聲。本市文化界曾有聯合宣言揭諸報端。大口呿舌發揮無遣自來救國運動每多步趨不一論其意義之明豁口號之單純指歸之嚴正。感召之迅捷。固未有如今茲一役者也。四郊多壘。室如懸磬。救亡圖存。人同此心。以言救國步驟。必日先謀統一。以言統－目標。必日志在救國。統一為救國之序幕救國為統一之結論二者有其必然之聯擊非可輕易相分閡。此統一救國之口號。所以能得各方一致之贊助也。</p>
<p>謂擁有如此巨大人口之國家。而竟不能發揮整個之力量。吾不之信。謂圓顱方趾之倫。而竟於甘自沈淪。不思振奮。吾亦絕難置信。然而數年擾攘之結果。迄未能有集中力量表現者。則意見參差認識不足有以致之也。一念之錯。貽無窮之戚毫釐之失。成千里之謬。事之扼腕。寗有逾斯。吾人當知。凡我所利者。敵皆害之。我所害者。敵則利之。我以救國為圖存之要策。人則百計以邊撓我救國之策動。我以統一為救國之先聲。人則多方以破壞我統－之形成。利用國人弱點之所在。施其各個聲破之伎倆。愿者脅之。貪者餌之。怯懦者惆嚇之。狐疑者挑撥之。內懷猜忌者。設詞而搆煽之。迨至鷸蚌互併。彼乃坐收其利。過去事實。憚於枚舉。略一澄思。不難恍然。自今伊始。謂宜人人抱定統一救國之决心。事事皆以統一救國為前提。犧牲小我之權益。維護國家之大計。放棄私人之忿悁。尊重政令之威信。在集中全國意志之下。以共謀救國行動之實體化。</p>
<p>昔人有云。哀莫大於心死。而身死次之吾國人心。果已盡死矣乎。則統一救國之吶喊。行將見其徒勞而無功。如其不然。吾人敢言。在統一局勢之下。未有不足以救國者。同時吾人亦敢言。在救國號召之下。未有不足以鞏固統一者。數年來一部分國人之犧性奮鬬為何。日為救國。數年來一部分國人之隱忍遷就為何。日為統－。今幸統一局面。粗具端倪。救國行動正圖亢進。斷不容再有任何藉口。作統－障碍。坐隳國家之命脈。助長敵人之氣燄。全國人士。應共鑒諸。</p>

<h3>日美棉業成立臨時協定</h3>
<p>日貨輪美受限制</p>
<p>大阪　日美棉業頃已訂立如下之臨時協定、日本方面除協定外、今後二年間運往美國之棉布總數量、自動統制如下、卽昭和十二年及十三年之兩年度、共為三億五千五百萬碼、（但十二年度之日本裝運量、不得超過一億八千萬碼）又關於日議棉業貿易各種問題之解决、在紐約及大阪設日美棉業審議會、為常設機關、其他附隨本協定之細目條件、二十二日起繼續協議决定之、今觀本協定之內容、從去年度美國於提高日本棉布關稅前之自制要求不過四千五百萬碼、而去年中、日本棉布運往美國者達七千三百五十一萬二千碼之事實觀之、知本協定雖為雙方讓步之結果、而結於日本可謂相當之成功、（二十二日同盟電）</p>

<p>河水汜濫　波及十州</p>
<p>［紐約］本尊爾凡尼亞等十州為水淹沒之區、電力饋送皆斷、故燈火不明、食水亦感缺乏、迨今俄亥倭河流域之居居、已有八萬人無家可歸、印狄亞那州之勞倫斯鎮已有七千人棄家而逃、該鎮之防水堤今日決口廣半哩、全鎮已成澤國、俄亥倭州之樓資茅鎮今日各工廠皆鳴汽笛、令民衆速離危險區域、因將開啟水閘、以圖保全需金百萬元築成高平呎之防水堤、該鎮一部分將因以被淹也、現水已越堤而過、茍不啟閘、堤有崩圯之盧、十州當局現傳來兩雪損失之報告、因是河水乃愈高漲、辛辛那蒂州之水災損失已達百萬元、各鐵路均不能按時開車、該州之俄亥倭河目下水位已高逾上次水災時十五呎半、各災區之大小河道、約漲至空前之高度、各項工業、皆為停頓、今尚恐發生火災與疫癘、則人民之艱困將愈甚矣、迄今各處死於水者、已達八十二人、</p>

<h3>日內閣屈服於軍部决定解散議會</h3>
<p>軍人領袖氣燄高張　議會制度重大打擊</p>
<p>［東京］日內閣今晨舉行緊急閣議、最後决定解散議会詔書或將於明日頒發、（二十二日中央社電）</p>
<p>［南京］政府决定於二十三日奏請日皇、頒發關於解散議會之詔書、（廿二日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］閣議之方針、已决定解散議會、二十三日奏請公布詔書、（廿二日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］內閣今日舉行緊急會議、歷四小時之久、卒屈服軍部之壓力、决議奏請日皇下詔解散議會、但尚須明日下午續開會議以確定之、此足徵內閣希圖恫嚇政黨放棄仇對政府之態度、惟各政黨亦不示弱、深信衆院可持通過龐大之整武預算案之舉、迫令要求解散議會之寺內陸相就範、內閣苟不奏請解散議會、則唯有辭職之一途、如果解散議會、則將為寺內陸相等陸軍領袖之大勝利、而議會制度將受一重大打擊矣、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［東京］日政府因濱田及寺內昨日之劇烈辯論、於昨日深夜决定議會停會兩日、廣田內閣與政黨間之種種正面衝突、已不可避免、議會甫集會一日、而關於一般問題之責問猶未完竣時、卽停會兩日、幾為空前現象、濱田昨日演詞之要旨、在於責難廣田內閣求助於軍部為唯一推動力、因此造成法西斯及獨裁政治之恐慌、傳日政府已察覺昨日議會中竟無一議員為政府辯護、而民政黨之態度雖比較緩和、但關於增稅及外交問題亦嚴加責難、其他小黨均對政府表示强烈之反對、不遺餘力、昨晚議會甫告散會後、解散議會之說卽甚囂塵上、聞因隸屬政友民政兩黨之閣員反對解散議會、故遂有停會兩日之决議、（廿二日中央社電）</p>
<p>［東京］政府於二十二日閣議席上業經决定解散議會、但正式决定須於二十三日之閣議方可發表、而政府現在决計不擁有任何與黨、斷然實行解散其意見所以趨於一致者、因軍部認為欲促現在之政黨加以反省、則除解散以外、當無他途、意見至為强硬故也、且廣田首相亦表示贊同、蓋政府並非以解散之結果而確信獲得多數、因選舉結果或當實行總辭職、亦未可知、閣僚一部分則認為此項總選舉之際、政黨之分野必發生變化、而現在之軍部當與其他勢力謀得協調、以圖一新庶政、又主張維持現狀、卽時使政黨政治復活而發生分解作用、具有此項見解者亦不乏人、總之議會被解散以後之政黨分野與夫政界之動向均為今後極堪注目之情形也、（二十二日同盟電）</p>
<h3>內閣緊急會議</h3>
<p>寺內陸相主解散議會　不恤以本人去就力爭</p>
<p>［東京］政府於二十一日衆議院會議散後、在議院內召開臨時緊急會議、先由寺內陸相發言、謂觀今日衆讓院中之論議、政黨各派兩人入閣而在政府黨之立場、然竟取反政府的態度、在此情形之下、議會殊難圓滿結束、政府應為重大决意、陸相並以頗强硬之態度、極力主張卽時解散議會、促各閣員之决意、前田·島田·賴母木·小川等黨出身閣員、一致反對陸相之議會解散論、而謂議會中論議、雖有多少反政府的意見、然未達不信任現內閣之地步、因此解散議會之說、實無道理、政府應為努力、使預算案通過議會、於是閣議空氣極為緊張、寺內陸相堅持自說不讓、並在言外表示其進退問題、而主張解散議會、但其結果决定奏請日皇休會兩日、以求議會反省、（二十二日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］决定內閣總辭職或解散議會之內閣會議、於今晨十時半開始舉行、截至下午二時止尚未散會、內閣會議前、全體閣員除隸屬政黨者外、一般意見均傾向解散議會、寺內陸相今晨九時與陸軍省首腦部舉行緊急會議、巳决定强硬議案、向今晨舉行閣議中提出、寺內嗣卽晋謁參謀總長閑院宮、報告軍部之議案海相永野亦在閣議前召開海軍省首腦部會議、全國人民咸平心靜氣、等待今日內閣之决議、政治空氣緊張無匹、據此間一般觀察、廣田內閣總辭職較為可能、並指出議會停開、適足增長議會議員之嫌忌耳、政府一方面旣無政黨聽其處置、他方面民政黨又不願予以擁護、故實際上巳無談判妥協之餘地、設議會解散將來重選之結果、更不難預料、故與其坐待崩潰、母寗立卽辭職、較為合法也、惟軍部態度極端强硬、堅主解散議會、俾免發生不幸事端、軍部深信重選結果、苟證明對政府有所不利、則再提出辭職、尚不為過遲、廣田究將接受上述何項意見、成為目前至大之問題、政黨現如坐針氈、固不顧議會解散、又不能與政府覓求妥協、一言以蔽之、內閣總辭職抑或議會解散、對今日日本內政有廣大微妙之關係、目前或將演成一種局面、卽政府雖充分認清不得不出於辭職之一途、但仍决定先行解散議會也、（二十二日中央社電）</p>
<h3>政黨態度强硬</h3>
<p>軍部企圖打破現狀　廣田內閣恐難久持</p>
<p>［東京］內閣會議今日雖確實决定解散議會、但未在形式上通過解散議會之决議案、須待明日午後之閣議始能作最後之决定、故尚有一日可作妥協之談判、政友民政兩大黨對政府停開議會兩日之舉、極為激動、分別集會決定强硬態度、卽於今日訓令各該黨出身之閣僚、對解散議會之議勿表同意、際此最後之時機、政黨出身閣員四人之可能的態度、極引起一般之注意、傳今日閣議席上、陸相寺內文相平生藏相馬場拓相永田等、主張解散議會最烈、農相鳥田高相小川等均反對此議、軍部所以堅持解散議會之理由、大致可如下述、現有之政黨、不宜與之共同實施“庶政‘新’之任務極端明顯、故政府絕對不應與現有之政黨妥協、政黨苟不變更彼等之態度、則舍解散議會外、當無別途可循、政黨雖以庶政一新為口實、但事實上仍企圖以自由主義者之見地、維持現狀、關於此點、無論自內外情勢而論、直等於進出及放棄整個大陸政策、此點實難獲得人民之允准、無論現有政黨人數如何衆多、彼等顯不能代表全國人民、故軍部方面斷定解散議會、極屬重要也云、總觀軍部解散議會之理由、吾人卽能明瞭解散議會意見之根據、及將來日本政治之趨勢、軍部及政黨間之正面衝突若是之急促、故結果如何極難預卜、同時所謂“打破現狀”之意見亦極重要、政府在衆議院中旣無與黨、而貴族院中多數議員又多反對政府、（如議會重開第一日各黨所提質問情形、卽可證明）故此間一般觀察、認為內閣絕對無獲勝之希望、解散之舉、亦感困難、並認為創造新閣之運動現頗活躍、企圖攫取瓦解現有政黨之可能的機會、此種運動若告成功、政府以强有力之擁護為後盾、或能集合若干擁護者、此種希望雖非完全無稽、但亦尠有實現之可能、蓋組織新黨、旣非易事、而獲得多數贊同尤感困難、縱能獲得若干擁護者、亦屬無裨於事、因此若干人士預料廣田內閣最後終難支持、而於總還舉後、將被追辭職也、內閣繼任人選、現已有紛紛加以猜測者、總之此次解散議會之目標、曖昧不明、而政府之勝利、亦屬無望、－般認為解散議會之目標為不能解釋者云、（二十二日中央社電）</p>
<h3>政友會政友會</h3>

<h3>財界同情政黨</h3>
<p>反對强化獨裁政治　人心浮動市塲混亂</p>
<p>［東京］二十二日以緊張空氣中重開之日議會、因政黨態度意外强硬、現出危險狀態、政府遂奏請休會兩日、財界尤其產業與金融方面所受印象、大體如次、卽財界對於政黨之態度、表示同情、並希望對於龐大預算及關於諸產業之法律案、加以徹底的修改、然因政府停會兩日、以致政界之不安狀態深刻化、財界受大衝動、殊難透察前途情形、對於政局之展開、頗為注意、自三四年以來、乘非常時之機會陶醉於軍需景氣中獲得巨利之產業資本家、因政府編製三十億元之空前大預算、大為恐慌、馬塲藏相昨日演說雖樂觀財政前途、然日本產業經濟界之現狀、實與藏相之演說相反、證明其不堪受容現在財政政策之事實、而破局的惡性通貨膨脹現象、被認為軍需景氣已達險境之表徵、於是財界决然採取全般的反政府態度、而此影響波及政黨之强硬態度、使其愈向反政府之方向、但議會突然休會兩日、政局不安、財界對此似無確乎信念與準備對策、金融界從來對於政府强化獨裁之政治、與其蔑視經濟界突然之政策、表示反對、同時對於政黨態度頗為關心、而期望抨擊現內閣之施政、然政局忽然惡化、以致受極大衝動後、現極力企圖迴避政局之不安、然證券二十塲及商品市塲不免受相當影響、（二＋二日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］解散議會後之政局、其歸趨若何、頗難逆覩、股票界現雖注視其前途、但以物價昂貴、而以重價購進者現已陸續拋出、故主力般票如新東忽由百五十元以上之地步跌落四十九元一角、由一兩日前之高價六十三元六角慘跌至十四元之譜、鐘紡股票亦大落十元內外、其餘各股票繼續跌至三元或五元、因政局前途難料、人心極為動搖，尤以傳聞陸相有辭職說、更助長出售方面之氣息、財界均將不安、此項形勢頗屬濃厚、（二十二日同盟電）</p>

<h3>戰時的財政（續前）</h3>
<p>— 奚東曙</p>
<p>（二）遺產稅，此稅為一種財富稅，由承繼人之所得，作一次的徵收，最合租稅公平負担的原則，且可用累進的稅率，英美等國，施用此稅已久，我們此時，宜卽速施行，以完成此稅的機構，以便將來充分的利用。</p>
<p>（三）戰時利得稅歐戰時，各主要國，均徵收一種戰時利得稅，在戰事進行，無數的人犧牲性命於疆塲的時候，有一部份人，因為政府有巨額物資的購買，以及必需品價格的驟漲，反而坐得額外的利潤，政府自應要攫取此種意外的收獲，英美兩國，對戰時利得稅均收百分之八十，法國則征收百分之六十，我們在非常時期中，也應該採用此稅。</p>
<p>（四）超過盈餘稅美國會施用此稅，以工商機關為單位，譬如先列年息八厘為標準盈餘，除開支外，如超過此成分，則課以超過盈餘稅，此稅征收的手續，較為繁瑣。</p>
<p>（五）臨時財產稅此稅係從個人財產上，作一次的割取，就一定日期中，將各個人的資產，凡超過某限劉者，則課以重稅，或一次繳納，或陸續付進，此為純粹財產本身的抽稅，並不根據－年的收益，此稅可以限制小資產的形成，且可使政府在一限期內，收進巨數，德國曾實執行一種“帝國緊急犧牲稅”，卽屬這類性質，此稅尚未曾通行，但仍可備緊急時的採﻿</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>用，對於我們現時經濟的環境，直接税中，可以極端利用的，就是所得税，其次爲戰時利得税，及遺産税。</p>
<p>除增征這幾種直接税外，還可採用以下的方法，以充實國庫。</p>
<p>一·國營事業的加價，國營事業，如電政，郵政，鐵道，航運，儘可加價，且收税甚速。</p>
<p>二·特種消費税，及娱樂捐的增加，凡屬奢侈品，如烟酒，鐘，錶，摩托車，化裝品等，均可課以特别税，入會費，娱樂塲入塲劵，也可以課税，此種税的負擔，都落在有經濟能方人的身上，並不防礙一般人的生活，凡含有奢侈性的消費，均可盡量的課税。</p>
<p>三·印花税，登記税，營業税等的增加。</p>
<p>四·免役税，凡受征國民，不願參加戰役者，均可課以相當的税額。</p>
<p>五·自由捐輸，戰時可勸導人民捐輸，如愛國捐，救國捐，國防捐，航空捐，節食捐等</p>
<p>六·外債戰時最好是借外債，不至動摇本國的經濟，而立即獲得大量物資的供給，俟將來再陸續以物資償還，這是最有利於戰時的財政，尤其是我們農業的國家，必須得外方物資的供給，恐戰時遭經濟封鎖，最好在戰事未發生以前，多借外債，但這也要看國際的環境如何。</p>
<p>總而言之，除能利用外債外，我們應當積極的利用各種課税，以充戰費，而利用內債，以爲調劑，戰時的公債，仍必須銷售於民間，不能使其充作發行紙幣的凖備，否則公債一出，紙幣隨之而來，造成通貨極端的膨脹，必使我們的貨幣，蹈馬克與盧布之後，但在戰事初起之時，新的税收，尚未流進國庫，公債也未及發出，勢必要向國家銀行，得緊急的通融，臨時的接濟，但不能視爲常策，使國家銀行，作無限制的供給，戰事一起，政府即應作根本之圖，向人民方面加税或舉債。</p>
<p>戰爭原是人力物力上絶大的消耗，當國家的命運，民族的存亡，判决於戰爭勝負的時候，無數的同胞，且不惜犧牲性命，凡屬國民，有經濟能力的，除維持最低生活外，都應盡量作經濟的犧牲，因爲如果戰敗，一切的一切，均不能享受，如果戰勝，民族可以生存，國家的地位，可以提高，個人的經濟，也可以改善，時以我們在戰時，應當作種種的犧牲，以求最後的勝利，對於政府爲戰爭而施行的各種課税與內債，也應該以最大的熱誠，接受和擁護。</p>
<p>當然戰事可以避免，則避免，萬一到了不得已的時候，很大的問題，就是財政，總要有充分的凖備，不使戰事受絲毫影響，要知非常時期的籌欵方法，是帶有幾分硬性的，與平時理財不同，如有適當的凖備，也不成問題的，就使假定每月支出戰費，爲二萬萬元，則一年支出，共爲二十四萬萬元，假如四分之一，或六萬萬元，出諸新的税收，其餘四分之三，計十八萬萬元，當然要乞靈於公債，我們現在每人平均公債的負擔，尚不到十三元，比諸世界各國，要算很小的數目，若以人口比例分配，這十八萬萬元公債，不過使每人增加負担四元，即使在第二年內，又發此數的公債，也不過使每人增加八元的負担，現在中國內部，已經完全統一，兄弟體察一般人民愛國的思想，以及擁戴軍事領袖的熱忱，相信對於戰時財政，一定可以順利進行的，至於新的税制，以及公債的辦法，現在無須乎詳細的説，今天不過提出一點大綱，貢獻諸位，作參考的材料罷了。（完）</p>
<h3>嘉善窰業復興之展望</h3>
<p>— 屠慧子</p>
<p>嘉善窰業，在全國占有相當地位，載在志乘。縣境之北，西北。東北三區，烟突如林，窰墩達八百餘座。農民悉以此爲正業。窰户計四百六十餘家，製户計十一萬餘人；坯户計二百二十餘人，其他運坯·裝窰·運貨·統曰窰工，平均一萬四千餘人，實爲全縣二十一萬民衆生計所繫。出産有甎·瓦·瓦板·大部屬於人工製造。機製之廠，僅泰山·華新·陶新·金門·等四廠，尤以泰山規模較大，有分廠在龍華，發行所亦最多。銷路以上海爲大宗，餘則通於長江淹域，年産甎瓦十一萬餘，值價五百八十九萬。自不景氣影響及於建築，窰業亦不能例外，銷路既呆，金融遂滯，貨價因以逐跌。窰户節省開支，裁工减薪，以致工潮疊起，而出貨運輸，時告停頓，同業復互相嫉妬，不惜偷工减料，貶價求沽，貨品既劣，信譽遂墮，外省窰業，又乘機掠奪本縣固有之市塲，本縣窰業遂一蹶而不振，縣長於樹巒，任民廳保甲指導員來縣視察，即認窰業爲本縣主要生産，間接有關全省經濟，意在復興，迨主縣政，遂召集全縣窰商，詳細研討，延請窰業專家來縣實地勘察，擬定計劃，呈請省廳，當於八五六次省政會議通過批准，於縣長又數度赴滬向各銀行家磋商貸欵，經費既有着落，因成立窰業管理處，縣長自兼處長，另聘工程顧問多人，十一月一日起開始辦公，分全縣爲七個窰區，每一窰區，設辦事處一所，管理員一人常駐辦公，建設廳亦派窰業專家胡厥文爲本縣窰業指導員，駐縣督導。又組織窰業研究會，聘黨政名人爲委員。更於十二月八日起在縣政府開辦窰業講習會，窰商與工作人員全體聽講。其復興要點有三：（一）改良品質：本縣窰貨，銷諸內地，究屬有限，當以上海爲最巨，年來建築，率用水泥鋼骨，或新式甎瓦，本縣窰貨，尚墨守成法不知改良，自難爭勝市塲，且貨品高下不齊，式樣大小無定，不合工程家所需要，同時又不能産大宗貨品，以合乎整個材料，因此急宜改良，其方法有二：（二）技術改良：坯泥之生熟混合與搗壓密度，新泥風化時間，均有一定標準，力求避免品質之鬆散粗率，或稜角不整，常派檢定員蒞塲檢定。而火力强弱，水量多少，則派督導員按窰紀錄，訂定奬懲條例，此外對於窰墩建築，裝窰技術，亦設法改進，並指定示範窰墩，爲一般表率。（二）檢騐出品：甎瓦之坏，均有模商製模，售於製户，現則舉行坏模商人登記，發許可證，方准營業。坏模須有一定方式，並用堅硬木材製造，附刻商標牌號，管理處加以檢定戳記，製户購進新模，不得自由削改，新模出貨，再經複檢，合格者加戳准銷。凡此數事，有稽查隨時稽查之。（二）節制産量：全縣窰墩，一律編號，月查其出品數量，並各埠消費數量，由管理處支配推銷，而窰墩之燒停，亦有一定，於是貨無壅積而適合市塲之需要。（三）統制運銷：窰户運銷，向係零販散買，且多同業傾擠。現則每一窰區，組織一合作社，窰户爲産銷社員，製户爲製造社員。又有基本合作社，分製坯銷貨購料三種，設指導員隨時指導，七個合作社，合組聯合社，由聯合社辦理運銷業務。上海杭州各設推銷處，有推銷主任，專職常駐，除運銷外，兼帶報告商情，宣傳産量。其次舉辦貨船登記，改販銷制爲儷運制，所有窰價與水脚，由處訂定，不得擅改。將來並從水運擴充至陸運，不特廢除牙儈之牟利壟斷，且調整交易手續而無兜售招徠之麻煩，此復興窰業計劃之大概</p>

<h3>怎樣教養自己的兒童</h3>
<p>— 羅正</p>
<p>有人說：兒童是民族的根本，民族乃國家的基礎，我們要談救國，自然首先應該使國家的基礎强固，而要增强國家的基礎，更需要培養民族根本；所以我們研究兒童問題實為急不容緩的當前唯一要務。現在，無論從敎育方面，健康方面，或甚至是思想，運動方面，我們都應當領導他們向着時代的軌道上前進。</p>
<p>敎養兒童是一件不很容易的事情，它比擔負任何工作為重，因為在幼孩時間，我們只要注意，那麼就可發現每一個常態的兒童應當怎樣地度他未進學校以前的歲月，在這時期中，種種健康的習慣，以及日後為人所必需的一切身心特徵，皆須形尤完備了；直至進了學校，那他的種種習慣和特徵又要經過－度改造與訓練。因為兒童只是人類中的一種幼蟲，在健康上，他們所需要的是正當的睡岷，正當的食物，相當量和相當種的遊戲，而同時，更應規定相當時間，實行檢驗身體，以便預備施行阻止疾病的發生。</p>
<p>任伺兒童，都富於創造性，模仿性，但也富於破壞性；——他們不拘得到一紙一物，都會做成一件不成模樣的東西，也會模擬別人的一舉一動，但同時也會破壞一件好好的東西。尤其是他們善於喜新厭舊，不拘食物玩具，在初得到手的時候，他們總是歡喜的，可是玩弄得稍久了便會厭惡，拋棄。他們的求知慾也很强，這隨時隨地都可以看出的。他們凡看見一件東西，或得到一件東西，總愛向大人追根究底；所以，這時候大人只要啟導以正當的智識，那他們一定很容易領會的。因此一般父母對於自己的孩子：㊀須持冷靜的態度。幼兒有不服從之處，如果你自己由此而引起過度的緊張和激動，則將使愛好刺激的兒童常常要不服從。㊁給與兒童以他自己的遊戲塲所和玩具，如果兒童與成人共處的時間太久了，他們的創發的自動的天性將為模仿所限制。㊂兒童看見了動目的東西而伸手去要，切不可攔阻他，或將東相拿開。因為這時毀壞了他的獨立性，而使兒童感到是必得依賴成人的。㊃要使兒童的每日生活成為紀律化，而且讓他遵循着一個日常生活的程序，不准逾越；因為遵守常規正是日後生活中的成功之捷徑。</p>
<p>今為一般學齡兒童，假定訂了一個日常生活的程序表在下面。——本文有幾點是從聞砧君譯，美國西部保留大學養護學科敎授，阿美何斯婁女士。所著“育兒格言”中參考過來的</p>
<p>每日午前七時起身，自己洗臉刷牙，傍人的帮助越少越好，洗漱以後，卽進早膳。八時半吃一匙魚肝油，隨卽到戶外去遊戲，十時飲一小杯橘子汁。十一時洗浴，並準備午餐，餐前須休息二十分鐘，午餐應自食，不得由傍人餵飼。午後一時左右是中覺的睡眠時間。三時飲牛乳一杯，再出外遊戲。五時半進晚膳，餐後應留室內作小遊戲，直到睡時。七時上牀入睡。每日應至郊野或公園中吸收新鮮空氣。——</p>
<p>但是遺憾得很，這樣一張簡單的，完備的生活表，却不是中國一般兒童所能夠享受的：如果中國有這樣一位保姆或父母的話，那也只有少數資產階級的兒子和女兒纔能實行。可是我却希望每一个中國的孩子都會有這份權利；所以我謹願將這张兒童生活程序”呈獻給新中國的每一個兒童之前。</p>
<p>兒童問題在歐西及日本各國，本來是十分重視的，卽是主張獨裁的希特勒，他曾經提倡過優生學，而世界老人墨索里尼，去年也會獎勵過生育。日本的對於兒童敎青，更是非常努力的。就是我國古代也很注意於幼兒敎育，“昔孟母，擇隣處，”即其一例，可是在若干時期以前，這樣一個嚴重的根本問題，反給國人忽略了過去。但是在目前這非常時期中，請婦女們來改造一下這些未來的主人翁的環境吧！</p>
<h3>湖南女學生的土布裙褂</h3>
<p>— 德隣</p>
<p>婦女們的虛榮心，是比男子來得更重大，伊們終日在幻想着：“衣必錦繡”，“居必麗都”：否則不足以表現其豪闊富有。近年來我國工商業的不振，洋貨的充斥，入超的驚人，所以便有人認為婦女是推銷洋貨最力的－員；不信的話，試看伊們日常不可缺少的脂粉香水，和衣飾的棉毛織品，都占着舶來品的大多數，但是伊們根深蒂固的虛榮心，這也是無可諱言的事實，在伊們心裹看的比任何都要來得重要，不過我們不可以一筆抹殺而論：惟有湖南女學生的土布裙褂，是值得欽佩和不可多觀的。</p>
<p>湘省在何芸樵主席的政治之下，敎育的發達，這是全國所及不上的，就首會一隅而論，學校林立，主其事者，頗能努力苦幹，措施完備，學生精神亦多富有朝氣，而尤以樸實的學生服裝在繁盛的街市上，你目光接觸到的莘莘學子，無論男女，終年穿了一身元色土布制服，但少穿着絲毛織品的；越發是一般女學生，非但是一律土布裙褂，並且不施脂粉，至於那種戴製衣服的士布原料，純粹是來自鄉間自紡自織和自己染的，這才配稱做是完全國貨了。</p>
<p>伊們的服裝，最多的是一種短褂短裙，上半截穿上一件元色土布褂子，下半身配上一條齊膝蓋的元色士布裙子，覆額的頭髪，明亮的秋波，在胸膛的右部，用白色絨線繡上了學校的名稱，和學校裏編列的號碼，雖然不塗脂抹粉，那種淡妝素抹，卻也別具風格，並且流露了一種天然的健康美，這是我們江浙截髮作時裝的女學生所不及的。</p>
<h3>西班牙戰爭中的女傑（下）</h3>
<p>— 伯懇</p>
<p>維多利亞女士不曾到過前線。她是太脆弱了。但她的思想却是很前進的、她主張：女子從軍不但使男性兵士受到一種要在女子面前獻功的鼓勵，且更使他們格外賣力。藉以保持在戰爭中男子勝於女子這傳統的優勢。</p>
<p>大概因為她素來擅長組織的緣故，所以目前她担任着徵募婦女軍隊的總管。徵兵事務所設在巴西羅那Barcelona地方的一所新式旅館中，門口掛着一塊木牌：“加泰隆女兵營總辦公處”裏面，打字員和速記員忙碌的工作着。中央安放着一張長方檯子，上首坐着四位女委員；她們是在檢閱排列在下首的約摸二十個特來應徵的候補娘子軍。在這些志願從軍的西班牙婦女中，有衣服襤樓的工廠婦女，有伶俐嬌小的女店員，有學過敎育的女學生，更有富麗堂皇的交際花。一個個地，她們挨次被喚到女委員面前。身體檢查是不需要的；簡單的口試和迅速的察看就算完事。結果，半數被派送到前線，半數留在後方服務。</p>
<p>服務後方的婦女分組担任三種工作—烹飪，看護傷兵，及照顧上前線去的婦女的孩子。上前線去的婦女也分組編入三種軍隊—步兵，砲兵，及航空隊。</p>
<p>在西班牙叛軍方面，也有一位顯著的女武士。她的名字呌做希諾利泰，杜洛斯SenoritaDolores。她是已故的迭克推多的女兒。在所有西班牙女武士中，她是最美麗的一個。</p>
<p>據說，希諾利泰女士曾做過“敢死巡查隊”Death　Patro's”的汽車夫。在被政府軍占領的加泰隆省市上，每天晚上有政府軍的軍官乘汽車出巡。叛軍方面的敢死巡查隊穿上彷傚政府軍軍官的服裝，乘坐塗繪着政府軍徽號的汽車，混入市上。看到一輛政軍的巡查汽車迎面馳來，他們便把一枚炸彈擲到牠的輪下。烟霧消散後，只剩一堆廢鐵和支離的屍體。這樣，他們四處馳騁，等候巡查汽車，加以襲擊。到了全市騷動，他們便棄車潛逃。</p>
<p>在此次西班牙內戰中，更有一位慷慨殉難的女武士。這就是安尼泰。洛浦茲女士AnilaLopez。她原是美利達Merec'a地方某藥房的店員，後來却做了西蕃蓮女士和維多利亞，甘脫女士的重要的助手。她的面貌醜陋得和村婦一般，但她却是一個學者。“她是識拉丁文的呀”，她的同村人常常這樣稱譽她。她更熟知西班牙的歷史。她記是伊莎伯拉女王Oueen　Isabella—哥侖布的恩君—率領軍隊把摩爾人逐出西班牙的故事。</p>
<p>當她聽到弗朗哥將軍率領摩爾人來奪美利達這消息的時候，對於回敎徒的傳統的恐怖使她着手緊急的對付。她邀集村民，組織防禦隊。她安排好把地雷裝在街道，方塲，及公共建築物下面。她知道：只要撳動電鈕，就可以把敵軍殺得乾乾凈淨，雖然全村亦將變成焦土。</p>
<p>可是，當敵軍到臨的時候，愛惜村民生命的念頭立卽使她改變了主意。她離開電紐傍邊，走到敵軍面前，大胆受擒野蠻的摩爾兵毫不客氣地把她縛住，不留情的槍彈轉瞬間斷送了她的生命她的最後遺言是：“至少，我死得太年經了”。這表示：她不怕死，却以不盡責而死為憾</p>
<h3>日本的新娘學校</h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>日本的有新娘學校，雖然還沒有幾年，可是近年以來，日本的新娘學校，却有高速度的發展，而結渠却已影響一般的女子高等學校。日本的女子，所以不願進高等學校而大家要進新娘學校，唯一的原因，就在新娘學校的學費低廉，而且在一個很短的時期之中就可受到做日本人的妻子的全部功課的訓練。課程之中，包括縫紉，家事，花卉佈置，茶會整備，以至主婦的各種禮儀等等，至於普通的女子高等學校，讀完全部的功課，至少要歷時三年之久，金錢和時間兩方面，都可節省，所以使多數女子，中等學校畢業之後，大家要進這種新娘學校。</p>
<p>據日本的報紙所載，那麼有一個女子高等學校，幾年之前，全校的學生有四百人之多，可是現在祗有一百多些，當然是受了新娘學校的影響，至少學年的太長，是一個重大的原因。所以日本的高等女子學校，要對付這種新娘學校主要的方法，就在把畢業的年限縮短。據說新娘學校之中，有一部分是由高等學校畢業的女生創辦而負責敎導的。現在除了醫科，產科的女子學校以外，一般的女子高等學校，都已受到影響，而學生的人數，在很快的减少之中</p>
<p>同時我們更知道日本的女子中學，到了學生畢業的時候，在事前的一年之中，也多半要指定一個時期，作為新娘訓練的時期。為的是這些女子，馬上就要畢業了，畢業之後，伊們有的雖然要升學，但大多數怕不能繼續求學而要踏進社會去找尋職業，以求自立了，其中一部分結婚的年齡巳屆，更說不定要結婚了。平時學校之中，課程的裏面，雖然也有家事，縫紉，烹調等課程，但在日本的學校當局看來，以為這些還不夠，所以要指定一個時期，作為專門訓練新娘，以補平時的不足。</p>
<p>事情是很有趣味的，那些女學生在訓練的時候，連得家裏也不回去，就住在學校的裏面。伊們所吃的東西，自己烹調，換下的衣服，自己洗濯，灑掃敎室，整理房間，所有的家事，都要操作：換句話說，凡是一個新嫁娘所應操作的事，都要實習一下的。日木的婦女，一種天生的服從性本來為任何邦國的婦女所不及的，學校的所以要實施新嫁娘訓練，當然在希望所有的女同學結婚而後，每一個能夠做賢妻良母，而且在未出閣前，在學校之中先經過一度相當的訓練之後，一旦出閣，對於家事方面，什麼都可措置裕如、不必再跟翁姑學習了、不但在日本的女子學校是這樣，就是日僑在各國設立的女子學校，現在到了最後的一學期，也有新嫁娘訓練的特別科目的。</p>
<h3>婦女與洗浴的常識</h3>
<p>— 曹義璇</p>
<p>洗浴對於身心的保健，是很有效果的。可是養成洗浴的習慣，與洗浴的常識，實為家庭婦人不可缺的要件。現把洗浴應當注意的各點與洗浴的利益，拉雜的說一下：第一，從外面回來受了寒風吹過的時候，絕對不可立卽洗浴，洗浴以前，須先把身體溫暖，因為身體冷時，皮膚的血管，都是收縮，突然地走到浴缸裏，血管要急激的擴張，那末，皮膚血管的收縮，擴張作用，要受損傷的，就是血管病發生的原因。倘若家庭中沒有洗浴設備，跑到外面的浴堂去洗浴，進了浴堂後，應當休息二十分鐘，才可脫衣入浴。第二，身體經過激烈的運動，或在精神勞動以後，也是不可立卽洗浴的，應當先把肉體鎮定，或休息一小時，恢復精神的疲勞後，才可洗浴。第二，浴水的溫度，更要注意，不可立卽浸到很熱的水，最初用三十八度至四十度的低溫水，把全身浸五分鐘，然後加高水溫至四十二三度，老人與婦人以及有慢性腎臟炭，血管硬化症的人，以四十度為宜，小兒二十八九度已足。所以浴水應先用溫度表驗過。第四，肚子饑餓，與吃飽飯的時候，切不可洗浴，食後應隔十一二小時，冬季以臨臥前為最宜，因為容易安眠的。普通浴後，須把身體溫暖小時，有妊娠的婦人，不宜久浸高溫的的浴水，因為下腹受了長時間的高溫，必使子宮筋收縮，往往有流產之禍。至於洗浴能夠保健身心的理由。是經過洗浴，刺激皮膚，可以增進內臟的活動。大凡住在冷的氣溫中時，全身的皮膚緊張，精神覺到疲勞，同時皮膚為防體溫的喪失，全身的皮膚血管，要極度的收縮，血液就送到內臟裏去，因為皮膚血管收縮，腦的血管，也要收縮的，於是腦內的血液循環，亦滯鈍了。就是腦內的營養亦不好，老廢的東西，積留不動，這時精神疲倦，神經興奮，全身愈加感到疲倦。他方調和內臟機能的種種中樞，因為血液循環的滯鈍，失去營養，肺，胃腸，內分泌臟器等機能，都受惡影響，身體自然就不適意了。所以做主婦的人，對於子女洗浴，應當十一分的留心，原來子女身體的强弱，完全為主婦的責任，主婦不解洗浴的常識，在現代的社會中，實在可恥的。溫水洗浴的生理作用，對於皮膚有重大的意義，就是皮膚裏有多數的血管，像細綱樣子平生的。我們全身的血液總量，大約有一半，是戴在皮膚的。因為經過溫浴，皮膚受溫熱的刺激，那末，皮膚裏的多數血管，一時擴張起來，皮膚的表面，聚集了多量的血液，時全身的血液分布，起了大動搖，換句話來說：皮膚的血管擴張時，內臟的血會就會收縮的。所以每天用溫水洗浴，能夠使身體各部的機能旺盛，增加食慾，同時分布於皮膚的多數神經，與內臟本有密切的關係，洗浴後，因為刺激一定的皮膚神經，卽能鼓舞一定的內臟，增高活動的機能，就是增强身體的抵抗力與內分泌，以及赤白血球，促進身體內新陳代謁的性能，而且因皮膚血管擴張，使腦的血液循環亦好，增加腦的營養，精神就會鎮靜，皮膚的氣管，不會閉塞，皮膚面的汗與脂肪，可以除去的。這種顯著的生理現象，應當明白的</p>
<h3>錢袋的開關</h3>
<h3>美容時應該注意的幾點</h3>
<p>— （蜜絲佛陀）</p>
<p>每一個婦女差不多都要實行美容，但是美容的方法，固然必須注意，美容的時候，也有幾點，應該留意：</p>
<p>㊀不要在男子面前美容許多男子都說，婦人的美貌是她們所獨有的，換一句話說，也是她們的秘密，因此她們就不能在男子面前，公開的捐破她們自己的秘密。按照情理來講，當一個男子看見婦女的美觀是借重美容品而獲得的話，對於婦女美貌的印象，也就根本不同了。</p>
<p>㊁不要在公開塲所美容在宴會的席上，或是在街上，却不是美容的地方，最好當在正式的美容室或是盥洗室裹。</p>
<p>㊂不要借別人的美容品借別人的美容品來實施美容，非但不合衛生，而且足以使人討厭。此外，各人的面貌各不相同，美容品的顏色，既隨着各人的面貌而配合，那末在另一個人使用起來，自然不能相稱，所以每一個婦女如果實施美容的話，就應該自備一套美容品。</p>
<p>㊃為女客備置美容品如果家裏常有女客來往，那末最好備就些美容品，以供她們偶然缺少美容品時使用，這其實也是主人家的一些禮義，是一個主婦應該知道的。</p>
<h3>女子與蒔花</h3>
<p>— 吳巧芳</p>
<p>花狀優美，花色鮮艷，女子愛花，以其性之相近也。</p>
<p>故以愛花之女子，而解種花之趣味，於社會上增進高潔風尚，於家庭內養成動勉性行，效益之大，匪可言喻。歐美日本，獎勵家庭園藝已數十年，故該國婦女，莫不俱有園藝常識，卽裝飾上花卉之應用，如餐桌角花，瓶養用花，以及在籃花球之結集和扦扎，亦均諗熟，可不假手於人。惟是園藝原分一部，曰果樹，曰蔬菜曰花卉，三者之中，果樹蔬菜，或需廣闊的地段，或需多大之勞力，或需豐裕之資本，或需精巧之技術，或須十數年間，始觀厥成，或須調集器械，乃善其事，何若花卉最易種植，用力不煩，見效頗速。且花壇量地設置，花盆隨處安排，卽僅止數弓之庭園，一經種植，足供晨夕之遊眺，四時之賞玩，分舉其利點，約有下列四端：</p>
<p>澄清空氣一般植物通性，畫間吸人炭氣，夜間則放出養氣，人能善為利用，日見身體康强，女子簡出深居，空氣易感陳腐，家中種植花卉，自然可以澄清，瓶養盆栽，裝飾美觀，猶其餘事，此種花之關於衛生上之利點也。</p>
<p>發抒鬱積　家庭間事，豈能盡如人意，女子性柔，每多鬱積，實為致病之根，時或不幸偶逢逆境，何以解憂！惟有花卉，觀其含芳吐艷，競秀爭妍，若目睹而神怡，遂煩惱之頓消，薔薇含笑，萓草療愁，此種花之關於養心之利點二也。</p>
<p>利用自然　植物在自然界中，種類旣多，無美不備，茍利用之有方，大足以增進家庭之幸福，例如花卉之內，江南槐立消驚毒，虎耳草廣治瘉傷，玫瑰花有製香水之用途，除蟲菊為辟蚊矗之藥料馨素茉莉引起薰風，偏竹佩蘭，潛消暑氣，形形色色，指不勝屈。惟花種者，獲享無窮藥利，此種花者關於自然界之利點三也。</p>
<p>印證科學　女子自入學以來，種植方面，多所講習，但敎材之或缺，標本之不齊，每致學理空談，實物莫睹，若家庭之間，培養花卉，隨時觀賞，獨類引伸，例如風媒蟲媒之特徵立辨，木本草本之性狀秀知，推之植物之生理作用，組織概要，繁殖方法，俱可實地考驗，益人神智，惟種花者易收若斯效果，此種花者關於科學界之利點四也。</p>
<p>他若播種勻苗，澆水施肥，以至除草驅蟲等，逐日從事，活動全體筋骨，習練勞動服役與花為友，涵養審美觀念，善畫者資以寫生，能詩者因而題詠，借助優美之花卉，愈發揮女子之天才，兩美壁合，相得益彰，家家有女，莫不愛花，女性嗜花，泃宜種之，他日，我國園藝之進展，造端在茲，家庭和樂，導源於斯，質諸女界，當無異辭也，願亟起圖之</p>
<p>去年春季，美國婦人會組織婦女園藝參觀團，（均係貴族婦女）週遊世界，考察各國園藝狀况，曾至上海及蘇杭南京等處遊覽參觀，所至各地，僅由各地地方政府照例設讌招待外，其他未聞有所舉動，及至日本，地方政府招待外，各地園藝團體，俱舉行盛大之聯歡會，並每日贈送各地原產之鮮花，非常活躍，非常熱烈，聞該參觀團，在日所得印象極佳，結果，該團同國後，曾向日本採購大批牡丹等花卉園藝植物云。據此以觀，可知美國婦女界，對園藝研究之熱烈與興趣，及日人之善於經商矣。（關於蒔花材料方法，可函訽松江松隱松下園丁，當有滿意之答復。）</p>
<h3>第三信</h3>
<p>— 卓呆</p>
<p>B女士：</p>
<p>你上星期的一信，問我；“要在庭中種些什麼花，可以一年到頭，不斷的有花可賞？”這的確是一個有趣的问題！</p>
<p>大約就是女士自己，要在府上的庭中，多種些花木麼？我從前也有過這種經驗，種了幾棵花樹，開花時，當然好看；但是有的時候，無花可賞，又是覺得庭園中太寂寞，尤其是在冬天，更為沒趣。所以後來種花樹，也往往使它們開花的期間，可以接得下去，甲花開罷，乙花又開，乙花將落，丙花含苞，雖在冬天，也可以不致無花可賞了。</p>
<p>不過現在一研究，方知其中有一個毛病。花是四季都有了，從庭園的價值上講，是完全不合理的。我國向稱庭園為花園，這句話也有語病。要曉得大概開花的樹，落葉樹占多數，常青樹極少，如果園中多種了花樹，那末，就是多種落葉樹了。春天夏天，固然熱鬧，一到秋天，葉子落盡，在庭園中一望，只看見許多朝天的光樹枝，這不是大煞風景的事麼？所以現代的造園家，往往多種常青樹而少種落葉樹，這是一個極普通的公式。多種常青樹，到了冬天，就不會看滿園蕭條之象，若全種了常青樹，又太沒有變化，所以要參加幾棵開花的落葉樹在內，使它一年四季，有不同的景象。發生無花可賞的時候，倒不是問題，連樹葉也瞧不見，庭園上才是一個大問題，因此必須守這公式。至於常青樹與落葉樹，該如何配置？怎樣比例？這要看了庭園的方向，環境，有位等種種關係而定，不能有一定數目。</p>
<p>這樣的辦法，如果愛看花的人，因着花有青黃不接之時，嫌太冷靜，也有一個很好的補救法。可以在庭園中最顯明的地方，劃一個地位，做一花圃。在這花圃中，多種草花，這就熱鬧了。本來看花，不一定要看木本之花，草花也大有欣賞之價值，而且近來外國種的草花，尤其燦爛，庭園中實在少不得它。普通的草花，往往分兩種，一種是春天的，一種是秋天的。</p>
<p>那未，一個花圃中，一年只開春秋兩次花，其餘的時候，不是仍舊沒有花可以看麼？這也有一個很妙的辦法，可以使它一年之中，不斷的有花。</p>
<p>最好另外有空地，種這些草花，到開花之時，才把這花，移到花圃中去，供人玩賞。其時把另外一種，又在空地中種起來了。到花圃中的花將謝，卽行取去，另換別的花進去。如此，花圃中的花，永遠不會斷了，草花雖分春秋兩種，倘使有的早種，有的遲種，也可以接得上去。</p>
<p>這樣辦法，花能夠永遠不斷了。那永久可以裝飾庭園的葉，也不致有時看不見了。女士何不照我的法子試一下！</p>

<h3>竭澤而漁不是好辦法</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>上海法租界當局，近日因為催收一中國藥劑門市發售章程捐”，激成界內全體國藥號的罷市，事態頗形嚴重。一方面公共租界當局，亦有於本年度起，增加市捐的擬議，引起界內各業的惶恐，函請停止。這兩事對於各業，關系甚大。現在我以第三者的立場，出來說幾句話。</p>
<p>公共租界的加捐，原因據說是因為財政竭乏，故將實行加捐，以資挹注。至若法租界的征收新捐，原因何在，尚無所開，大約想亦不出於財政問題。因財政竭乏，而征收新捐或加捐，原是可以的，但這必須附有條件。㊀應於法有據，㊁應顧反納稅人的能力。</p>
<p>據國藥號說，當局的徵收“章程捐”，是於法無據的，但當局則說這是根據公董局辦法而施行。這一點屬於法理方面，我不想多說。至若要問及目前各業，有無繳納新捐的能力，那我敢斷定，是負擔不起的。</p>
<p>事實擺在人們的眼前，上海市面，近年受經濟恐慌的影響，日趨衰落。這從各業的相繼倒閉，及商店大減價的旗幟，可以看得出來。故現在各業不要說是新捐或加捐，無力繳納，恐怕連其他的捐稅，亦有不勝負擔的痛苦。可見在目前的狀況下，要徵收新捐或加捐，實無異竭澤而漁，不論當局所持的理由，如何充足，辦法是極不妥當的。</p>
<p>至若法租界當局，用斷水斷電的手段，來壓迫國藥號，至於激成全體同業的罷市，更屬非法。因為徵收章程捐問題，卽使非實行不可，亦須從正當的方法解決。斷水斷電，實足以影響人民的營業及生活。况諸國藥號，既無積欠水電費，當局自無權加以截斷。</p>
<p>現在公共租界加捐的擬議，尚未寶行，希望當局顧及各業的困苦情形，自動停止。而法租界的催收新捐，已激成界內全體國藥號的罷市，事情且有據犬的趨勢，我們更希望雙方，早商解决的辦法。</p>
<h3>霧</h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>天空凝固著乳白色的水蒸氣，沉重的像壓在心腔上的鉛塊，呼吸都急迫起來了，今朝已是第三朝的大霧。</p>
<p>一輛出廠電車燃亮著電炬，掌車的頻頻踏著鈴警告前面的行人車輛。車輛裏沒有一個乘客，電炬彷彿天上的星星，一團糊糢的黑影倒在車廂角裏，大概是賣票人在那裏打瞌睡吧？人力車夫駝着背，把車打挾在腰窩肢裏，蹣跚地靠着路邊，蛇行過來。那裏有一個小食的攤子，一盞媒油燈在冒着的然氣中顫慄着，車夫都在這裏停靠了車輛，圍着攤子買點心屹；也有一二個車夫放出他們尖銳的目光，在碼頭上，人行道上尋覓他們的第一個主顧，—他們常常沒帶一個子兒從家裏出來，要做着了一個生意才買食他們的早點。</p>
<p>穿紅馬夾的清道夫，靠在電线木桿上望着遙遠的黃浦江，那裏停泊着一艘飄着米字旗的軍艦，這或許不是他的目標，他在懷念着糢糊一片對江的家裏，有一個年高的老母或是在喂奶的孩子，等着他賺錢回來做冬天的衣服呢！他竟是出了神，把凍得發僵的手指伸在馬夾的口袋裏呆立着，那柄掃帚就像一個遺棄了的婦人似的摔在他的腳邊。</p>
<p>在凝固的空氣中鈴聲又響過來了，現在不是電車上的鈴聲，那清道夫的耳覺還是很聰明的，他知道他的同伴已經率着垃圾驢車從隔馬路走來。他馬上用呼吸着的曖氣溫了溫手指，搶過地上的掃帚，彷彿有人要掠奪他似的，勤快地在街心掃着，等到他能夠看清楚牽驢車的是那樣一個面藐時，電线木桿的邊上已經堆着很高的垃圾了。</p>
<p>他們點頭招呼着，挽驢車的從衣兜裏搜出兩枝爛縐的姻捲，他們在擋風的方向燃了火，兩道濃烟混合在霧層中時，他們低低地談着一些不相干的事，幾乎忘去他們的工作還沒有做完，而那頭馬驢却搖着頸上的銅鈴在警告他們了。</p>
<p>剛才挽着空車的人力車夫做着了生意又回來了，而且帶來了另外一個客人，那顯然是乘開往內河的頭班輪船的。雖然瞧不見江海關上的大鐘，輸船上的水員却沒有疏忽了他的責任，已經拉第二次回聲了。</p>
<p>不知什麽時候，什麽地方趕來的人羣，在碼頭上擁擠着，那裏是一幅人生的寫真：有兒子送着父親回家去的，也有妻子捨不開新婚的丈夫，發財的果然微笑着做着歸家的好夢，從同鄉親戚那里借了一筆最後的盤纏的，或許對着黃浦江在痛恨上海為什麽沒有容納他的餘地呢！</p>
<p>那無情的輸船拉第三次回聲了，它把悲歡離合隔開在碼頭上，奮勇地冲破了濃厚的霧層向江心駛去，遺留在碼頭上的心都像憑空地掛了起來。船影漸漸沉入在乳白的空氣中了，他們旋過身來時，人力車夫蜂羣似的把他們包圍住了。</p>
<p>濃霧漸漸地淡了，雜亂，匆忙又把都市的原形顯了出來。</p>
<p>一羣小癟三倦伏在一家貨棧的牆角落裏，他們把報紙遮蔽着身體，他們又僥倖度過一個冬天的晚上了！</p>
<p>但是，“三朝大霧發西风”，天上或許為着富貴的人們要過年，醞釀着要下一场“瑞雪”呢！</p>
<h3>天下第一菜的史料</h3>
<p>— 藩根</p>
<p>近日各地大小報紙，有關於江蘇省陳主席所發明之“天下第一菜”的新聞頗多，筆者因與陳先生素識，日前晤談之下，叩以究竟，亟為記其大略，以嚮閱者。</p>
<p>“天下第一菜”係蝦仁，雞湯，番茄，鍋巴合配而成（他報有悮載番茄為番椒者）原非先生所發明，不過經其發現優點，而加以改良，並定其名稱而已。緣民國十八年先生赴杭，在某處一小飯館進餐，菜中卽有此品，惟尚非現在之四料配合者，先生見其顏色之艷麗，鍋巴之清脆，味旣鮮美，而鍋巴入湯之後，發蚩然悅耳之音，香氣撲鼻，認為具備聲香色味之好菜，且其價不過數角，因是每於吃飯時常憶及之。會有友人邀宴於聚豐園，先生卽提議以此菜代魚翅，蓋通常宴會，每以魚翅爲主菜，表示敬客之意；惟魚翅價昂，且多外貨，味亦僅厚膩而已，實不如此菜之鮮美也。斯後先生常於友人問宣傳此菜好處，惟尚未定其名稱。先生有堂妹留學於比利時老，因不慣食外國菜，自作炊食，先生曾去函告以此菜作法，及種種優點，並謂調之得官，可稱為世界第一好菜，其堂妹遵法烹之，頗為滿意，遍告彼邦友人，以其四美兼備，莫不詫為新發現，爭相調作，則此菜業於斯時傳入異邦矣。後先生主政蘇省後，適江蘇物品展覽會閉幕，盛宴佳賓，命廚司作純粹江蘇菜以享之，蓋符江蘇物品之意也。品類齊備，可謂集江蘇菜之大成，同時亦參加此菜，並確定配備為蝦仁，雞湯，番茄，鍋巴，不准摻入其它物料，而定其名為“天下第一菜”，人多以為“天下第一菜”與“江蘇菜”同時脫胎，實則此菜已有其數年之曆史，近日報章之載以為新聞者，實已爲舊聞矣。</p>
<p>此後陳先生凡宴賓客，必備此品，故凡曾參加陳先生宴會者，大都嘗過，年底並親爲作頌，於指陳此菜優點而外，復多因物勵志之句，詞意宏大，頌曰：“是名天下第一菜，色聲香味皆齊備，宴客原非專惠口，自應兼惠眼耳鼻，此菜滋補價不貴，可代燕耳或魚翅，番茄鍋巴雞與蝦，不獨肥甘更健胃，燥與濕兮動與植，中外水陸品類萃，勇敢赴敵屈能伸，因物尤可激志氣，我今鄭重作宣傳，每飯不念願向嗜”。並爲普及起見，將頌詞印成小紙，本年元旦宴會，分贈各客，鎮地報館記者得之，遂為揭諸報端。</p>
<p>近來鎮江人自誇有三個天下第一在鎮江，一為天下第一江山，在北固山，延陸吳琚所題；一爲天下第一泉，在金山寺左近，似為清乾隆御題；一卽陳主席之天下第一菜也。</p>

<p>銀壇祭酒喬治亞立斯，與滬人闊别已久了。現在他的作品「布衣天子」The　King's　Vacation已定於今日起在國泰大戲院開映，這未嘗不是影壇上的一個好消息吧。喬治亞立斯在片中飾一個個性奇特的國王，他因爲皇帝的生活，過於拘束，一舉一動，都不能自由，並且當國內革命爆發時，他竟起來和革命黨携手，寗願抛棄皇位，劇情諷刺，演出幽默，亞立斯的演技，當然是超凡入聖，毋庸多述，且除亞立斯外，尚有狄克鮑惠爾，亞立斯夫人及派屈烈茜愛麗絲等大明星合演，更爲此片生色不少。</p>

<h3>「夜半歌聲」雜綴</h3>
<p>金山在「夜半歌聲」中飾一純正的革命青年，與「狂歡之夜」中之浪子姿態絶然不同，演技則又過之。</p>

<p>胡萍飾一含寃莫伸之弱女子，表演內心抑鬱數幕，於傷感中充滿熱情，美麗淸秀，别創作風。</p>
<p>「夜半歌聲」故事，極衷感頑艷離奇曲折之至。</p>
<p>「夜半歌聲」中有許多狀貌奇特的人物，化裝精妙，有令人不寒而慄之魅力。</p>
<p>攝影師余省三薛伯青爲「夜半歌聲」光綫的構造，下了不少心血，處處顯得恐怖萬分。</p>
<p>「夜半歌聲」是一首悲壯的抒情詩。</p>
<p>馬徐維邦爲攝製「夜半歌聲」處心積慮，嘔盡心血。</p>

<h3>The Hopes for a Peaceful Resolution in Shaanxi and Gansu Are Very Slim</h3>
<p>Yang Hucheng's Letter is Vague; Li Zhigang Departs from Nanjing After Visiting He Yingqin; The Situation in Lanzhou is Not as Stable as Before</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The prospects for a peaceful resolution in Shaanxi and Gansu are dwindling. Yang Hucheng is stubbornly acting on his own, having ordered his troops to actively prepare. Military forces are deployed along all lines, indicating defiance to the end. The puppet political departments under the control of the Red bandit Zhou Enlai have moved to Lintong along with Yang's military headquarters. Several propaganda teams have been dispatched to various locations to spread propaganda to the soldiers. Military conferences are held daily in Xi'an, with senior Red bandit military officers and political personnel participating. When Mi Chunlin, Bao Wenyou, and Li Zhigang met with Yang Hucheng in Xi'an, Yang did not accept the central government's offer of leniency. Li Zhigang met with Minister He Yingqin and central authorities on the evening of the 21st to report on his meeting with Yang Hucheng, and presented a letter from Yang. The contents of both were extremely vague and impractical. Furthermore, the situation in Lanzhou is not as stable as before. The Red bandits in Hexi have largely retreated, but are blocked by the central army, preventing them from linking up with Lanzhou. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Li Zhigang, representing Yang Hucheng, arrived in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 21st. After reporting to Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, he continued to consult with Minister He at 9:00 AM on the 22nd. He departed from Nanjing for Zhejiang at 10:00 AM to make a report, expected to arrive that afternoon. He will stay for a day or two before returning to Nanjing. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Lei Baohua, the Director of the Construction Department of Shaanxi Province, and his wife, arrived in Nanjing a few days ago. This afternoon, they visited Shao Lizhi, the Chairman of Shaanxi Province, to report on the situation. Lei told people that he had already resigned from his position as Director of the Construction Department and did not feel comfortable expressing opinions on the current situation in Shaanxi. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The second group of foreigners evacuated from Xi'an, including six Italians, one British national, and one Spaniard, arrived in Nanjing by Eurasia plane on the 21st. They boarded an express train to Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd. Approximately twenty more foreigners from Lanzhou, Pingliang, and other locations will also be returning east in stages. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] There have been minor skirmishes along the defense lines for several consecutive days. (Special dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] It will not be easy to resolve the Shaanxi incident peacefully. It is widely believed that if the central government is willing to endure the pain of suppressing the rebellion, it will not be difficult to eliminate the rebels in a short period. There are also reports that the Red bandits in northern Shaanxi are attempting to cross the river and flee eastward. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] According to railway news, there is little hope for peace in Shaanxi. The central army is adopting a defensive posture. Yang Hucheng has lost his freedom of action after allying with the communists. Zhang Xueliang's troops will likely not align with Yang. Yang is currently wavering and feels increasingly isolated. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Peng Zhaoxian, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Shaanxi Province, Hang Yi, the Administrative Inspector of the Second District, and Zhou Xuechang, the Provincial 指委 [likely 指導委員會 - Guidance Committee] , jointly visited Secretary-General Weng of the Executive Yuan on the 22nd to report on the situation in Shaanxi Province. It is said that Peng plans to travel to Shaanxi soon. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A telegram from Tongguan reports that the troops of Zhang and Yang on the front lines have repeatedly provoked the central army's defense lines in recent days. The central army is maintaining a strict defense, but no major battles have occurred. The Red bandits who entered Xi'an have suddenly withdrawn from the city and are densely distributed in the villages. Their pseudo-political workers are intensifying propaganda among the troops and work among the civilians. Yang Hucheng's troops stationed in Sanyuan have begun to move towards Xi'an, and the defense duties they leave behind are being taken over by the Red bandits. It is also reported that the Red bandit Xu Donghai's faction is now following pseudo-orders, taking the route through Shangxian County, and plotting to disrupt western Henan in order to divert troops. Their vanguard has reached Ziziguan. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Foreign sources say that due to Yang's deteriorating attitude, there is no hope for a peaceful resolution to the Shaanxi-Gansu problem. As a result of recent consultations between Yang and the bandit leaders Mao, Zhu, Xu, etc., there will be a new organization. (Special dispatch from the 32nd)</p>
<h3>Telegrams from Various Quarters Requesting the Suppression of Yang and Yu</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou] The Joint Association of Guangdong Province and City Journalists, the Press Association, the Education Association, the Municipal Education Federation, and principals of various primary and secondary schools, totaling over thirty organizations, have sent telegrams to the central government. They stated that Yang and other rebels, instead of seeking to atone for their crimes, are openly colluding with bandits and defying orders. If they are not severely punished, it will be more difficult to deal with them later. They requested decisive action, ordering a suppression to uphold national discipline and solidify the foundation of the nation. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Chengdu] The agricultural, industrial, commercial, educational, and women's organizations of Huayang County sent a telegram to the central government on the 21st, requesting a clear order to suppress Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong in order to maintain the foundation of the country. At the same time, they also sent telegrams to Yang and Yu, explaining the advantages and disadvantages, urging them to repent and obey the orders of the central government. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanchang] The Jiangxi-Sichuan Journalists Association, because Yang Hucheng did not obey the central government's handling of the Xi'an Incident, sent a telegram to the central government requesting strict sanctions to uphold the law. They also sent telegrams to Yang and Yu, advising them to wake up early, atone for their sins, and perform meritorious service to redeem their past mistakes. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Gao Guizi Goes to Taiyuan to Visit Yan Xishan</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Gao Guizi left Beiping this morning for Taiyuan to visit Yan Xishan to discuss issues such as the joint defense of Shanxi and Shaanxi. After the meeting, he will return to Suide to resume his defense duties. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Hosts a Banquet for Important Figures at His Private Residence Tonight</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Wang is scheduled to host a banquet at his private residence on Yihe Road at 7:00 PM on the 23rd for important figures from the central government and heads of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd. He visited Chairman Wang at Yihe Road at 10:00 AM for consultations, and then visited Foreign Minister Zhang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss matters. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>De Wang's Attitude Becomes Passive</h3>
<p>Having his Powers Reduced, He Has Returned to Pangjiangzhuo Sea Tribe and Opened a Big Green Ditch</p>
<p>[Tianjin] A telegram from Jining reports that the director of a certain special agency stationed in Jiabusi is monitoring the reorganization of the puppet Mongolian government, reducing the powers of De Wang and expanding the powers of the advisers. De Wang is unhappy and his attitude is passive. He left the temple on the 21st and returned to Pangjiang, ostensibly to recuperate under the pretext of illness. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] A telegram from Jining reports that the eastern front of Suiyuan has been thoroughly defended after Zeng Tingyi's deployment. The puppet bandit army in Nanhuaqian has not moved since the 20th. On the 21st, a reconnaissance aircraft with a certain symbol flew from Shangdu to the airspace above Xinghe, circled for a while, and then flew away. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] A telegram from Jining reports that the puppet Mongolian army of the Zhuo Sea Tribe has arrived at Daqinggou. Liu Guitang, Cheng Guorui, and the puppet army recruited by the puppet government are currently being vigorously trained and organized in Zhangbei and Shangdu, and will be led by Jin Huanwen, the chief of staff of Liu's army. There are already 1,300 men, but the firearms have not been fully distributed. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] Certain parties in Jiabusi, Zhangbei, and Shangdu have been holding important meetings with military leaders of the bandits, puppets, and Mongolian troops stationed there for several days to discuss the overall attack on Suiyuan, which is expected to take place before the lunar new year. Currently, they are engaging in disruptive activities. According to related sources, 13,000 boxes of gasoline and over 300 tons of coal have been transported from Zhangbei to Jiabusi and Shangdu in the past ten days. On the evening of the 22nd, seventeen carts of coal continued to arrive at the temple. On the evening of the 21st, three aircraft arrived at the temple from Duolun and are parked at the airport. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] It is rumored that De Wang's attitude is passive and he has flown to Pangjiang to recuperate. Li Shouxin and others are currently discussing the attack on Suiyuan. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Tashiro Hosts a Banquet for Feng Zhi'an</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] Tashiro hosted a private banquet for Feng Zhi'an at his official residence in Zhangyuan at 6:00 PM on the 22nd, accompanied by Hashimoto, Wachi, Iida, and others. Feng is scheduled to host a return banquet for Tashiro and others at the Tianjin Municipal Government's Flower Hall on the 23rd. He will leave Tianjin next week to inspect various counties in southern Hebei. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Song Zheyuan intends to return to Beiping before the Spring Festival to welcome his mother to Beiping for the New Year. He will host a banquet for Tashiro next week before departing. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] A telegram from Baoding states that Feng Zhi'an recently issued an order to all commissioners, stating that he will uphold his original principles and implement the three major policies of suppressing communism, prohibiting drugs, and eliminating bandits. As for opening canals, digging wells, revitalizing industry, promoting culture, and other construction projects, all are for the welfare of the people. He hopes that all colleagues in the province will handle matters carefully and will severely punish anyone who perverts the law and harms the people. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Air Defense Drill Held in Taiyuan</h3>
<p>Yan Xishan and Zhao Dai Accompanied by Their Families Seek Refuge in Underground Caves; All City Traffic is Cut Off, and Businesses Close</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] The air defense drill in Taiyuan officially took place this morning. At 8:30 AM, it was assumed that nine enemy aircraft flew along the Zhengtai Railway Line to Taiyuan and engaged in an aerial battle with our aircraft outside the East Gate. Yan Xishan and Zhao Dai, along with their families and government officials, sought refuge in underground caves outside the East Gate. All city traffic was cut off, and businesses closed. The performance was extremely realistic. At 3:00 PM, a drill simulated enemy aircraft attacking from northern Shanxi. At 8:00 PM, a drill simulated a blackout and the dropping of flares. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Qin Dechun Hosts a Banquet for Various Sectors</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Qin Dechun is scheduled to host a banquet for political, business, and banking leaders on the evening of the 23rd to discuss measures for disaster relief loans for businesses. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Organization in Eastern Hebei Secretly Plots to Expand</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] The expansion of the puppet organization in Eastern Hebei was recently discussed with the head of the Third Section of a certain military headquarters outside the Guan. Recognizing that the Shaanxi Incident has occurred, and the situation in North China may change, the plan has been temporarily suspended. However, the internal strengthening of the puppet organization is still proceeding as usual. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Establishes a Large-Scale Smuggling Organization</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] A large-scale smuggling organization established by ronin on Route 8 of the Tianjin French Concession has not yet been named but will be called the Hebei-Chahar Transportation Company or the Manchuria-Mongolia Transportation Company. It will use thirty heavy-duty trucks on the Tianjin-Tanggu and Tianjin-Beiping highways, equipped with weapons. It plans to start operations in early March. Currently, there are over 50 million yuan worth of smuggled goods in a certain concession in Tianjin. The ronin plan to sell them all within six months. Because it is difficult for customs and the Chief Inspectorate of Highway Transport to suppress smuggling in the suburbs of Tianjin, they often follow the smuggling trucks for dozens or hundreds of miles to intercept and detain them. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Qingdao] On the afternoon of the 22nd, when the Zao Long Maru arrived in Qingdao from Dalian, a certain foreigner was found to be smuggling a large quantity of white sugar and rayon ashore. The goods were seized by customs and only released after taxes were paid. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Tianjin Flour Exchange Begins Operations</h3>

<p>[Tianjin] The Tianjin branch of the Joint Match Company opened yesterday. All factories of China Chemical Industry are participating. Sales will begin in mid-February. The standard price has been approved by the head office. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Prince Pan Departs from Suiyuan</h3>
<p>[Guihua] Prince Pan of the Siziwang Banner left Suiyuan this morning to return to the banner to oversee matters, due to the importance of defense in northern Suiyuan. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Resumption of the Longyan Coal and Iron Mines is Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] The matter of resuming operations at the Longyan Iron Mine is currently awaiting resolution on how to settle the old shares. Lu Zongyu has been summoning the old shareholders for discussions in recent days. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>We Have Accepted the Principle of Exporting Lu Salt</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] We have accepted the principle of exporting Lu salt. The only difference lies in the price of salt. Japanese Vice-Consul Nagai, the director of the Tianjin branch of the Kyokoshin Trading Company, is in contact with the authorities. The Committee for Improving the Townships of Southern Hebei has decided to install siphon pipes in Gaoyang County to divert water from the Hutuo River for irrigation, which can irrigate 200,000 mu and increase annual salt revenue by 100,000 yuan. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Traitors Arrested in Yuxian County</h3>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Traitors Xia Dingchu and Wang Zigao, under the instructions of a certain party, colluded with local bandits in Yuxian County, plotting an uprising. They were arrested by the county and handed over to the Zhengzhou Commissioner's Office for interrogation on the 22nd. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Reclamation Corps Organized in Mabian County, Sichuan</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] There is a vast expanse of wasteland in Mabian County, Sichuan, with fertile soil. In order to promote production, local figures have recently initiated the organization of a reclamation corps. The planned project will first carry out collective reclamation in the area around Quantuo Temple and Bei'ao, forming five groups, with ten households in each group. The necessary funds have already been raised. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Inquires into Cases of Japanese Aircraft Landing Arbitrarily</h3>
<p>In order to file a protest</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Japanese aircraft have repeatedly landed arbitrarily in Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan in recent months, and have even distributed absurd publications. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already protested to the Japanese side, but has not yet received a response. On the 21st, another Japanese aircraft flew to Qingdao.

<h3>Wang Jingwei Broadcasts a Speech on How to Save the Nation from Destruction</h3>
<p>Eliminating Internal Troubles and Defending Against Foreign Aggression - Proceed According to the Original Plan and Steps</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Broadcasting Station invited Chairman Wang Jingwei to give a broadcast speech at 8:35 PM on the 22nd, entitled "How to Save the Nation from Destruction." The original words are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, what I want to talk about tonight is how to save the nation from destruction. The so-called saving the nation from destruction is because the disaster of national subjugation is right before our eyes, and we must think of ways to save it. The disaster of national subjugation is so imminent because internal and external troubles are pressing in from all sides. First, let's talk about foreign aggression. After the September 18th Incident, we first lost the three northeastern provinces, and then Rehe. In between, there was also the Battle of Shanghai, the Battle of the Great Wall Passes, and northern Chahar, eastern Hebei, and Hebei are all in extremely difficult circumstances. Such gradual encroachment can lead to China's destruction. Then, let's talk about internal troubles. Wherever the communist bandits go, the people suffer. From Jiangxi, to Hunan, to Guizhou, to Yunnan, to Sichuan, and even to Shaanxi and Gansu, such devastation can also lead to China's destruction. If either of the above two occurs, it is already a disaster for the country, let alone that the two seem to have a secret agreement, using two knives to kill people from two different paths, and now they are gradually merging together? Some people say that it is better to be destroyed by the communist bandits than by foreigners. It should be known that destruction is the same, no matter who causes it. We should not sit idly by and watch it happen, but must save the nation. Some people say that Soviet Russia practiced communism and did not perish. It should be known that Russia's national environment is completely different from ours, and the revolution was also completely different from ours. Moreover, besides Soviet Russia, some countries in Europe that wanted to practice communism have all fallen into danger and destruction. Hungary after the Great War, because it wanted to practice communism, was invaded by Romania and occupied its capital. You must all remember that. Therefore, victorious Italy after the Great War, after a period of communist disturbance, quickly had fascism to counter it. Defeated Germany after the Great War, after a period of communist disturbance, quickly had the National Socialist Party to counter it. Spain has not even fully implemented communism, but is only close to communism, and has already suffered great chaos. The outcome of the chaos is still unknown, but Spain has already been divided into two, and the capital, Madrid, has been shattered. From all this, we can see that not only would China's current practice of communism lead to national destruction, but even being close to communist bandits and being manipulated by them would be enough to cause great chaos and lead to destruction. For several years, China has been struggling in the midst of these internal and external troubles, and when it could take care of eliminating internal troubles, it could not take care of defending against foreign aggression, and when it could take care of defending against foreign aggression, it could not take care of eliminating internal troubles. For several years, the government and the people have been trapped in this double attack, exhausted and overwhelmed, truly indescribable suffering. In such a double attack, it is very difficult to find a way to open up a path to survival. For several years, after accumulating countless painful experiences, we have finally formulated an overall plan and specific steps for saving the nation from destruction. Especially in the past year, this plan and these steps have been steadily moving forward and have been unanimously recognized by the whole country. If this plan and these steps are not unexpectedly hindered, we believe that internal troubles can come to an end in the shortest possible time, because it is well known that the communist bandits have gradually become impoverished after fleeing to Shaanxi and Gansu. If they repent and reform, it will not be difficult for them to comply. Otherwise, they can only be eliminated, and China can focus all its efforts on foreign affairs without worrying about internal affairs. Unexpectedly, there was the Xi'an Incident of December 12th last year, and even more unexpectedly, after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek returned to the capital safely, there was still a part of the army resisting orders and even taking actions towards redification. In this way, internal troubles become more complicated and foreign aggression becomes more rampant. Today, when we talk about saving the nation from destruction, I have no profound theories, but only a sincere appeal for the people of the whole country to recognize the environment, stand firm, and continue to follow the overall plan and specific steps for saving the nation from destruction. You must not be swayed by the communist bandits and fall for their divisive tricks, because although the plan and steps for saving the nation from destruction are multi-faceted, they can be summarized as nothing more than two slogans: "Defend the territory against foreign aggression" and "Unite the people internally." These two slogans have now been detected by the communist bandits and are being used to carry out their divisive tricks. First, let's talk about "defending the territory." We only need to look at the recent defense of Suiyuan against foreign aggression to see that considerable progress has already been made. This progress has not been easy to achieve. Since the two battles of Shanghai and the Great Wall, the government and the people have deeply felt various shortcomings and have been constantly working hard to remedy them, enduring and intensifying their efforts, only then to achieve this progress. The leadership of the central authorities, the concerted efforts of the local authorities, and the unanimous support of the people of the whole country have all been demonstrated in this instance. And at this critical moment, the Supreme Commander was suddenly almost met with misfortune, and the local separatism was about to be re-enacted. With such shaking in the rear and on the flanks, the front lines are also at a loss. What a painful thing this is. This kind of action is clearly dividing the territory, but the communist bandits insist on using the name of resisting Japan, using the name of defending the territory to carry out the reality of dividing the territory. Then, let's talk about "uniting the people." Since the outbreak of national crisis, from the National Crisis Conference to the upcoming National Assembly, all are manifestations of uniting the people. We must know that only the Kuomintang can unite the people, and the Communist Party can never do it. Why is that? The Kuomintang aims at national revolution. The so-called national revolution is to seek the survival and development of the entire country and the entire nation. Therefore, it is based on the common interests of the entire country and the entire nation, and seeks its unity. This is inevitable in reason and in situation. The Communist Party takes class struggle as its aim, advocating using one class to overthrow other classes. Therefore, dismantling the united front of the people is also inevitable in reason and in situation. Just look at the time when the whole country was united in defending the territory against foreign aggression, and suddenly they manipulated from the middle, causing rifts in the troops under the banner of the National Revolutionary Army, and causing rifts in the territory under the flag of the Republic of China. This is a very great evidence of dismantling the united front of the people, but the communist bandits insist on using the name of the "People's Front," using the name of uniting the people to carry out the reality of dismantling the people. What I just said about the divisive tricks is evident here. I believe that if we want to save the nation from destruction today, we can only work hard according to the original plan and steps in order to realize it. And to realize it, the people of the whole country must give the government their full support, without second thoughts, without detours, calmly, bravely, and vigorously moving forward, so that the divisive tricks have no place to be implemented, and the attempts of those who harbor ambitions to seize the opportunity to separate and govern will not occur. Only in this way can we eliminate internal troubles, and only in this way can we defend against foreign aggression. The most important thing for saving the nation from destruction at present is no greater than this. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

The Ministry submitted its findings to the Executive Yuan for referral to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The Ministry has now received a reply from the Legislative Yuan, stating that it has been decided to approve the draft convention later. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Economic Experts Discuss Inheritance Tax</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] An economic expert stated that inheritance tax has been implemented for a long time in various countries around the world. It has a sound tax system and is extremely fair. Our country is still in its early stages of implementation, and the tax rate should be kept low to avoid the occurrence of evasion. However, the income tax has not been implemented for long, and the inheritance tax should only be levied after it has been effectively implemented. This will ensure that preparations are sufficient and investigations are accurate, and then proceed gradually. He added that current bank interest rates should be reduced to encourage those with surplus funds to invest in industrial construction. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Record of a Trip on the Tongguan-Luoyang Train</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Mingxin</p>
<p>On my trip to Luoyang, I stayed for a morning and evening, briefly collecting local customs and writing them down. I gradually learned that there is a train westward from Luoyang to Tongguan every day, so I decided to take it. Since the train departs late, I had some free time, so I visited the Longmen Grottoes and the White Horse Temple, each located more than twenty miles from Luoyang, one to the south and the other to the east. Going south out of the west gate, I first passed the West Palace, which is the location of an important central plains town, with large-scale construction and abundant weapons. As it concerns military secrets, I did not observe further. Then I crossed the Luoyang River, passing Tianjin Bridge (Shao Yong's poem "The cuckoo cries on Tianjin Bridge" refers to this bridge). The bridge is an old structure, unable to bear heavy loads, and a new bridge is currently being built to its left, with the foundations already laid. It is expected to be completed soon. The bridge is located at Shao Yong's old residence, Anle Nest, where his descendants still live, and their virtuous reputation continues to this day. Further on is Guanlin, the tomb of Guan Yu after his head was returned after his death. Ancient cypress trees and red walls surround the palace halls. It was recently renovated by Liu Zhi. I briefly visited it before reaching Longmen. Longmen is building a new bridge, which is not yet completed, but it is magnificent in scale and can meet military needs. The Longmen Mountains stretch continuously, and were cut through by Da Yu to allow the Yi River to flow through, forming cliffs on both sides of the river, known as Yique. The Longmen stone carvings are only a few decades later than Yungang, but they are more damaged. There are small caves on every mountain, and almost every cave is empty. Broken heads and severed feet are everywhere. The cultural relics of more than a thousand years ago have been reduced to firewood by merchants, which is regrettable. Recently, there has been much talk about preserving the ancients, but even the remnants have been stolen recently. Officials have a duty to protect them, so how can they do their job well? I believe that in a few years, there will only be stone caves without Buddha statues. The most magnificent and largest is the Jiujian Palace on the mountainside, where Empress Wu once built a separate palace to escape the summer heat. The Great Buddha is more than fifty feet tall and is still intact. On the opposite bank is Xiangshan Temple, the former residence and burial place of Bai Juyi. He donated his house to become a temple after his death, but it is now in disrepair. Gradually following the road north, I turned out of the east gate to the White Horse Temple. Passing through the east gate, I saw the stele of Confucius entering Zhou to inquire about rites and music. The cultural relics of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty evoke deep thoughts of the past. Ahead is Jiama Camp, the birthplace of Zhu Yuanzhang. Zhu Yuanzhang founded the country with benevolence and righteousness, and his release of military power with wine is a beautiful tale for later generations. Thinking of it, thinking of it, it is far beyond my reach. Further on is the White Horse Temple, which has been destroyed for a long time. Recently, many benefactors have begun to renovate it, but the scale is still not open. The stone carvings are certainly not older than the Jin Tianxi period. This is the initial foundation of the great dharma that came east from ancient Yanhan, but it has fallen into disrepair. Those who promote the dharma should do more to make it clear. In front of the temple is the stupa, which is ancient in construction and square in shape. It has been repaired many times since the Han Dynasty, but it still stands tall in the clouds. The two holy monks, Kasyapa Matanga and Dharmaratna, who carried the sutras from afar, are also buried in the temple. I stayed for a year, but did not see any steles.</p>
<p>From Luoyang to Tongguan is 225 kilometers, and the train takes eight hours. The following are some things that can be recorded along the way: Jingu Garden Station is the old site of Shi Chong. The ruins of the fallen building cannot be found in the desolate smoke and grass. Mianchi is where the King of Qin struck the urn, which shows the way of befriending neighbors, which is very much in line with the spirit of today's equal standing. Arriving at Tongguan, the left is a majestic town, and the right is the Yellow River, with a myriad of scenes. The gate is towering, but it is severely dilapidated. There are many armored vehicles parked at the station, all waiting for orders in the rear. The main roads in the city are divided into four streets: east, south, west, and north. East Main Street has many shops, South Main Street has many grain shops and flower shops, and the walls are covered with red and green paper slogans. Some say Yang Hucheng is a public enemy of Shaanxi, some say Zhang Xueliang is a good man who is brave in correcting his mistakes, some say be careful not to be deceived by approaching bandits, and some say only by concentrating China's strength can we deal with foreign countries. These four items are the movements in politics and military affairs.</p>
<p>There are not many troops stationed in the city, because most of the troops have been ordered to go to the front line for deployment. However, many units on the front line have liaison offices in the city, plus those responsible for guarding and maintaining security. In this small place, there seem to be more soldiers in uniform than civilians. However, the military's training has been improving recently, so the citizens are not alarmed at all, and the market has been revitalized, and trade has become more frequent. There are many soldiers in the restaurants, either sitting alone or eating in groups of three or five, paying the price without demanding anything. Observing this coldly, I know that the progress of the country can be seen here. The soldiers also understand the great righteousness and know the truth. When talking to those sitting next to them, they say that the soldiers are serving their country and have nothing else to say. Every movement and gesture is a resource and vitality of the country. If we can turn perversity into peace, eliminate the communists, and get the other side to repent, then we can restore our strength and move north with even greater courage. The officers and soldiers come from all over the country, and they especially like to talk about the great victory in the Battle of Baiduishan, saying that although they did not participate in the battle themselves, they learned from the telegrams that our army was strong. They believe that it is not difficult to consolidate our country, but it is a pity that there are obstacles.</p>
<p>As for the military deployment here, due to the sensitive nature of the matter, I cannot say everything. Huaxian is in front of Chishui, and across the river is Weinan, which is the territory of Liu Duoquan's 105th Division of the Northeast Army. Liu's troops were originally in Huaxian. After the incident, the front line here immediately went to attack Huaxian, but it was difficult to defend with a small earthen city, so Liu's troops retreated. Fortunately, the area has not been greatly damaged. Now the arrow is on the string, and it is not impossible to rein in the horse before reaching the cliff, so we must wait and see the political operation and whether the other party repents. The phone and telegram lines to Shanxi'an are connected and then cut off. Recently, people have not been allowed to pass through, but there are still a few who can return home. According to them, the communist army did participate, but in small numbers. Currently, they have not carried out large-scale looting of the people. As for Yang's troops, during the incident, the order was chaotic. Two newly arrived blue steel trains of the Longhai Railway were not only completely destroyed, but also the velvet chairs and bedding inside were looted. Soldiers hung velvet blankets on the tips of their spears and sold them along the street for only a few cents each. Even the velvet cushions of the seats were cut off with bayonets, which can be said to be the ultimate in destruction.</p>
<p>In Tongguan City, the people are bustling as usual. Vendors sell food and cloth along the streets endlessly. The North China Hotel is the best in the area, and it is always full of customers. The ancient sites in the city, such as the tree that Ma Chao stabbed Cao Cao in the east street when he escaped. The stab wound is still in the tree, which has not withered to this day. In the Fuxing Medicine Store, soldiers go to see it, jostling and crowding. The Great Temple of Guan Yu, where the characters sometimes appear in intaglio and sometimes in relief. (This must be due to the reflection of sunlight. The locals say it is a sacred object.) Many people also go to see it. As for the Guanxi Academy, where Yang Zhen refused the legacy of gold in the Han Dynasty, thinking that heaven knew, earth knew, I knew, and you knew. There are fewer people who know it, and only those with a scholarly air go to seek the legacy of prudent solitude. There is a theater in the city, a thatched cottage with earthen steps, performing Shaanxi opera. The entrance is deserted, while the post office and telegraph office across the street are not very spacious, but people come to remit money and send letters. They are all soldiers in uniform with swords, and they are extremely crowded. Those who disassemble characters and write letters sell books in the open courtyard in front of the house, and their livelihoods are also thriving. People have the same heart, and the willow color on the street has been the same since ancient times. (Sent from Tongguan on the 18th)</p>

<h3>The Meaning of Unity and National Salvation</h3>
<p>— Gao</p>
<p>"Unity and National Salvation" is a newly emerging call. The cultural circles of this city once issued a joint declaration published in the newspapers. Expanding greatly on the meaning of national salvation, the many past movements of national salvation are not consistently aligned, but now the meaning of this slogan is clear and simple, the guiding principle is strict, and the appeal is swift. The borders are surrounded by enemies and the house is empty. Saving the country and surviving is on everyone's mind. Speaking of the steps to save the country, we must first seek unity. Speaking of the goal of unity, we must focus on saving the country. Unity is the prelude to saving the country, and saving the country is the conclusion of unity. The two are inevitably linked and cannot be easily separated. This is why the slogan of "Unity and National Salvation" has received unanimous support from all parties.</p>
<p>To say that a country with such a huge population cannot exert its full strength is unbelievable. To say that people with heads and feet would willingly sink into decline and not think of rising up is also difficult to believe. However, as a result of years of turmoil, the failure to concentrate strength is due to differences of opinion and insufficient understanding. A wrong thought can lead to endless sorrow, and a millimeter's mistake can lead to a thousand-mile deviation. There is nothing more regrettable than this. We must know that whatever benefits us, the enemy harms. Whatever harms us, the enemy benefits. We take saving the country as an important strategy for survival, and others try every means to sabotage our efforts to save the country. We take unity as the precursor to saving the country, and others try to undermine the formation of our unity. They exploit the weaknesses of the Chinese people and use their tricks of separate destruction. They threaten the willing, bait the greedy, intimidate the timid, and provoke the suspicious. Those who harbor suspicion are incited with false accusations. Until the snipe and clam fight, they reap the benefits. Past facts are too numerous to list. With a little reflection, it is not difficult to understand. From now on, everyone should be determined to unite and save the country, and everything should be based on unity and national salvation as a prerequisite. Sacrifice the interests of the individual to maintain the overall interests of the country. Abandon personal grievances and respect the authority of government decrees. Under the concentration of national will, jointly seek the realization of national salvation actions.</p>
<p>The ancients said that there is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart, and death of the body is second. Has the heart of our people died completely? Then the call for unity and national salvation will be in vain. If not, we dare to say that under the unified situation, there is nothing insufficient to save the country. At the same time, we also dare to say that under the call to save the country, there is nothing insufficient to consolidate unity. What have the sacrifices and struggles of some Chinese people been for in recent years? For saving the country. What have the forbearance and compromise of some Chinese people been for in recent years? For unity. Fortunately, the unified situation is beginning to take shape, and actions to save the country are advancing. There must be no more excuses to obstruct unity, undermine the country's lifeline, and increase the enemy's arrogance. The people of the whole country should take note of this.</p>

At the same time, the Defense Committee ordered non-combatants to move out of Madrid within seventy-two hours, otherwise they will be forced to leave the city. Azaña said in his speech that the rebels have used Moors and foreign aid from certain countries, which has made the civil war a serious international problem, or may even escalate into a European war. The invasion of Spanish territory by foreigners is no different from attacking the Spanish Republic government. From 5:40 PM this afternoon, the rebels resumed shelling the capital with artillery.

<h3>Bombs Explode in Various Parts of the Portuguese Capital</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Destroyed, Ministry of War Damaged, Twelve Bombs in Total, Fourteen People Detained</p>
<p>Lisbon Today, several bomb attacks suddenly occurred in the city and its suburbs. The first was in the center of the city, destroying a house that was formerly the Spanish consulate. A bomb also exploded at the Portuguese Radio Club, about ten miles from the city. A tower of the National Broadcasting Station in the suburbs was also damaged by a bomb. The greatest loss was at the Ministry of Education, a two-story building that was completely destroyed. When the ceiling collapsed, the minister and a secretary narrowly escaped. Only Captain Dulis was injured. When the bomb exploded, the Portuguese anti-communist army was holding a meeting inside the ministry, and several of its leaders were spared. The fourth bomb exploded in the Ministry of War, resulting in five injuries. The fifth bomb exploded near the oil depot of the Mobil Oil Company, but only destroyed a truck and slightly injured a passerby sleeping next to the house. Another bomb shattered the glass windows of the arsenal. So far, there have been no reports of deaths anywhere. It is reported that the authorities have now arrested fourteen suspects, including one Englishman and one woman. According to the Minister of Interior, these acts of violence are a reflection of international unrest, especially the Spanish incident. This must have been done by the communists, who must have been incited by foreigners and assisted by unscrupulous Portuguese elements. Until midnight, a total of twelve bombs exploded. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lisbon After the bombing in this city the day before yesterday, the House of Representatives immediately convened a meeting to discuss it. All the members expressed their indignation, saying that the national security was threatened and that all means should be used to maintain it. If necessary, they would not hesitate to punish the traitors with severe laws. Some said that the Ministry of Education was also hit, and some members were suspected of complicity. The situation was serious, which was self-evident. Subsequently, the proposal by Speaker Dous Reis was passed, requesting the government to take various measures to maintain security, and declaring to the government that the House of Representatives was closely related to the government.

<h3>Results of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross's Trip to Japan</h3>
<p>Statement by the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>[London] Labour Party member Davies asked the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Viscount Cranborne, in the House of Commons today to explain in detail the results of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross's trip to Japan. Cranborne replied that Sir Frederick Leith-Ross was ordered to visit Tokyo twice after going to the Far East, so that there would be an opportunity to exchange views on financial and economic issues of common interest to Britain and Japan. However, Leith-Ross was not tasked with negotiating any specific events, in other words, no agreement was concluded. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan-US Cotton Industry Establishes Temporary Agreement</h3>
<p>Restrictions on Japanese Goods in the US</p>
<p>Osaka The Japan-US cotton industry has recently reached the following temporary agreement: In addition to the agreement, the total amount of cotton cloth shipped to the United States by the Japanese side in the next two years will be automatically controlled as follows: In the two years of Showa 12 and 13, the total will be 355 million yards. (However, the amount shipped by Japan in Showa 12 shall not exceed 180 million yards.) Regarding the resolution of various issues in the Japan-US cotton industry trade, the Japan-US Cotton Industry Council will be established in New York and Osaka as a permanent organization. Other detailed conditions attached to this agreement will continue to be negotiated and decided from the 22nd. Looking at the contents of this agreement, considering that last year's US requirement for self-restraint before raising tariffs on Japanese cotton cloth was only 45 million yards, and that last year, Japan shipped 73,512,000 yards of cotton cloth to the United States, it is known that although this agreement is the result of concessions on both sides, it can be said to be quite successful for Japan.

<h3>Severe Flooding in the Midwestern United States</h3>
<p>River Waters Overflow, Affecting Ten States</p>
<p>[New York] Ten states, including Pennsylvania, are submerged by floods. Electrical power is cut off, causing darkness and a shortage of drinking water. To date, in the Ohio River basin, 80,000 people are homeless. In Lawrence, Indiana, 7,000 people have fled their homes. The town's levee broke today, spanning half a mile, turning the entire town into a swamp. In Louisville, Ohio, factories sounded sirens today, ordering the public to quickly evacuate danger zones, as they prepared to open the sluice gates to save the million-dollar, tall-footed levee. Part of the town will be flooded as a result. The water has already breached the levee, and if the gates are not opened, there is a risk the levee will collapse. Authorities in the ten states are now reporting heavy snow losses, causing the river water to rise even higher. Flood damage in Cincinnati has reached one million dollars. All railways are unable to operate on schedule. The current water level of the Ohio River in that state is more than fifteen and a half feet higher than the last flood. The large and small rivers in the disaster areas have risen to unprecedented heights. All kinds of industries have come to a standstill. There are now fears of fires and epidemics, which will further exacerbate the hardships of the people. To date, the number of deaths caused by the floods has reached eighty-two.</p>
<p>Follow-up Dispatch The sluice gates in Portsmouth were opened at 3:00 AM to divert the floodwaters, flooding commercial areas to save the entire town. After the gates were opened, water poured into the streets, immersing shops and factories. 1,300 merchants and workers living in that area evacuated overnight. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Pope in Mortal Agony</h3>
<p>Vatican City At approximately 12:00 AM tonight, it was officially announced that the Pope "appears to be in mortal agony, relying only on the power of prayer, and has not yet passed away." It was also stated that the Pope's condition is extremely critical, but a pulse remains, and he occasionally appears thirsty. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Vatican City Tonight, members of the diplomatic corps who visited the Holy See to offer their condolences expressed deep concern about the Pope's condition, considering it extremely dangerous. The Pope is now also suffering from asthma, making breathing difficult. As a result, the heart is working even harder, and the body's fluid circulation is poor. Swelling in the legs may lead to gangrene. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<h3>Statement by the Japanese Military</h3>
<p>Attacking Political Parties Hinders Japan's Progress</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Army authorities issued the following unofficial statement late on the 21st, expressing their belief: "Observing the current state of existing political parties through the atmosphere and speeches within the Diet today, their attitude remains the same as before, disregarding themselves and focusing solely on attacking others. It is completely impossible for the military to carry out a renewal of general administration with such political parties. If existing political parties have concrete plans and oppose the current renewal of general administration, that could be forgiven. However, they verbally advocate for the renewal of general administration while forgetting the surging reform intentions that arose after the February 26th Incident, and they have no concrete plans. Such actions by political parties, using the renewal of general administration as a pretext to maintain the status quo, hinder Japan's progress and instead invite its decline. This not only impedes Japan's role as a stabilizing force in East Asia but also turns it into an isolated island nation. Whether Japan can fulfill the mission the Japanese nation should undertake in this state is a question that the 90 million citizens must resolve through criticism. Political parties that have traditionally used party interests and strategies as tactics, disregarding national and public welfare, have now been placed under national scrutiny and have completely abandoned their value for continued existence. The realization of true parliamentary politics that conforms to the Constitution, and that parliamentary politics correctly recognizes its position, must first address the solution of important issues such as clarifying the national essence, strengthening national defense, promoting industry, and stabilizing the people's lives. Is this not the only path for the regeneration of existing political parties? In short, the current situation is a conflict between maintaining the status quo and breaking the status quo. The victory of the faction that breaks the status quo is the victory of the renewal of general administration. If existing political parties do not recognize this current state, they will inevitably face a state of disintegration." (Allied Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Police Deployed</h3>
<p>To Protect the Safety of Cabinet Members</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Today, the entire police force was ordered to deploy to protect cabinet members and those who spoke in the Diet yesterday. This indicates that the Japanese political situation is currently extremely tense. Army Minister Terauchi, Vice Minister Isoya, and other high-ranking officials consulted and then returned to Japan to meet with Chief of the Army General Staff Prince Kan'in. It is reported that the Army Minister reiterated his claim that if the political parties do not reconsider their attitudes, the Diet should be dissolved. Navy Minister Mizuno held a meeting last night with key officials from the Ministry of the Navy and resolved to support the Army Minister's attitude. (Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Yields to Military Pressure, Decides to Dissolve the Diet</h3>

<p>[Tokyo] The Cabinet held an emergency meeting today that lasted for four hours and finally yielded to pressure from the military, resolving to petition the Emperor to issue an edict dissolving the Diet. However, it will hold another meeting tomorrow afternoon to confirm this, indicating that the Cabinet hopes to intimidate the political parties into abandoning their hostile attitude towards the government. However, the political parties are also not showing weakness, believing that the House of Representatives can hold a vote to pass a huge military budget, forcing Army Minister Terauchi, who is demanding the dissolution of the Diet, to comply. If the Cabinet does not petition for the dissolution of the Diet, the only option is to resign. If the Diet is dissolved, it will be a great victory for Army Minister Terauchi and other military leaders, and the parliamentary system will suffer a major blow. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Due to the intense debates between Hamada and Terauchi yesterday, the Japanese government decided late yesterday to suspend the Diet for two days. All direct conflicts between the Hirota Cabinet and the political parties have become unavoidable. The Diet had only convened for one day, and the questioning on general issues had not yet been completed when it was suspended for two days, which is almost unprecedented. The main point of Hamada's speech yesterday was to criticize the Hirota Cabinet for relying on the military as its sole driving force, thus creating a fear of fascism and dictatorial politics. It is reported that the Japanese government has realized that not a single Diet member defended the government in yesterday's Diet session, and although the attitude of the Minseito Party was relatively moderate, they also severely criticized the government on issues of tax increases and diplomacy. Other small parties expressed strong opposition to the government, sparing no effort. The idea of dissolving the Diet was rampant as soon as the Diet adjourned last night. It is said that because cabinet members belonging to the Seiyukai and Minseito parties opposed the dissolution of the Diet, the decision was made to suspend the Diet for two days. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At today's Cabinet meeting on the 22nd, it was decided to dissolve the Diet, but the formal decision must be announced at the Cabinet meeting on the 23rd. The government has now decided not to have any affiliated parties and to resolutely implement the dissolution. The reason for their consensus is that the military believes that if they want to urge the current political parties to reflect, there is no other way than dissolution. Their opinion is extremely strong. Furthermore, Prime Minister Hirota also expressed his agreement, as the government is not confident in obtaining a majority as a result of the dissolution. It is also possible that they will implement a total resignation as a result of the election. Some cabinet members believe that the division of political parties will change during this general election, and that the current military should seek coordination with other forces to achieve a renewal of general administration. There are also not a few who advocate maintaining the status quo, immediately reviving party politics, and causing a decomposition effect. In short, the division of political parties and the trends in the political world after the Diet is dissolved are extremely noteworthy developments in the future. (Allied Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Emergency Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Army Minister Terauchi Advocates Dissolving the Diet Struggles with His Own Resignation to Argue His Case</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the House of Representatives meeting adjourned on the 21st, the government convened a temporary emergency meeting in the Diet. Army Minister Terauchi spoke first, stating that based on today's deliberations in the House of Representatives, the parties each sent two members into the cabinet and took an anti-government stance while in the position of the government party. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for the Diet to conclude satisfactorily, and the government should make a major decision. The Army Minister strongly advocated for the immediate dissolution of the Diet, urging the cabinet members to make a decision. Cabinet members from the parties, such as Maeda, Shimada, Yorimotoki, and Ogawa, unanimously opposed the Army Minister's argument for dissolving the Diet, saying that although there were some anti-government opinions in the Diet, they did not reach the point of no confidence in the current cabinet, so there was no reason to dissolve the Diet. The government should make efforts to pass the budget bill through the Diet. As a result, the atmosphere in the cabinet meeting was extremely tense. Army Minister Terauchi insisted on his own views and implied the issue of his own resignation while advocating for the dissolution of the Diet. However, the result was a decision to petition the Emperor of Japan to suspend the meeting for two days to seek reflection from the Diet. (Allied Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The cabinet meeting to decide whether to resign en masse or dissolve the Diet began at 10:30 this morning and has not yet adjourned as of 2:00 PM. Before the cabinet meeting, the general opinion of all cabinet members, except those affiliated with political parties, tended towards dissolving the Diet. Army Minister Terauchi held an emergency meeting with the heads of the Ministry of the Army at 9:00 this morning and decided on a tough proposal to submit to the cabinet meeting this morning. Terauchi then visited Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in to report on the military's proposal. Navy Minister Nagano also convened a meeting of the heads of the Ministry of the Navy before the cabinet meeting. The people across the nation are calmly awaiting the decision of today's cabinet, and the political atmosphere is extremely tense. According to general observations here, a total resignation of the Hirota Cabinet is more likely, and it is pointed out that the suspension of the Diet is sufficient to increase the suspicions of Diet members. Since the government has no political parties to follow its lead on one hand, and the Minseito Party is unwilling to support it on the other, there is practically no room for negotiation and compromise. If the results of the re-election after the Diet is dissolved are even more difficult to predict, it would be more legitimate to resign immediately rather than wait for a collapse. However, the attitude of the military is extremely tough, insisting on dissolving the Diet to avoid unfortunate incidents. The military believes that if the results of the re-election prove to be unfavorable to the government, it would not be too late to submit its resignation again. Which of the above opinions Hirota will accept is the biggest question at present. The political parties are sitting on pins and needles, neither ignoring the dissolution of the Diet nor seeking a compromise with the government. In short, the total resignation of the Cabinet or the dissolution of the Diet has a broad and subtle relationship to Japan's domestic politics today. A situation may now develop in which the government, while fully recognizing that it has no choice but to resign, still decides to dissolve the Diet first. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Political Parties Adopt a Tough Stance</h3>
<p>Military Attempts to Break the Status Quo Hirota Cabinet May Not Last Long</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Although the Cabinet meeting decided today to dissolve the Diet, it did not formally pass a resolution to dissolve the Diet. A final decision will not be made until the cabinet meeting tomorrow afternoon, so there is still one day for compromise negotiations. The Seiyukai and Minseito parties are extremely agitated by the government's decision to suspend the Diet for two days and have convened meetings to decide on a tough stance, instructing their respective cabinet members today not to agree to the dissolution of the Diet. At this final moment, the possible attitudes of the four cabinet members from the political parties are attracting general attention. It is reported that at today's cabinet meeting, Army Minister Terauchi, Education Minister Hirao, Finance Minister Baba, and Colonial Affairs Minister Nagata advocated for the dissolution of the Diet most strongly, while Agriculture Minister Torda and Communications Minister Ogawa opposed the proposal. The reasons why the military insists on dissolving the Diet can be summarized as follows: It is extremely clear that the existing political parties are not suitable for jointly implementing the task of "renewing general administration." Therefore, the government should absolutely not compromise with the existing political parties. If the political parties do not change their attitudes, there is no alternative but to dissolve the Diet. Although the political parties use the renewal of general administration as a pretext, they are in fact attempting to maintain the status quo from a liberal perspective. From the perspective of both domestic and foreign affairs, this is equivalent to abandoning the entire continental policy, which is difficult for the people to approve. Regardless of the number of existing political parties, they clearly cannot represent the people of the entire country. Therefore, the military has determined that dissolving the Diet is extremely important. By observing the military's reasons for dissolving the Diet, we can understand the basis for the opinion to dissolve the Diet and the future trends of Japanese politics. The head-on collision between the military and the political parties is so urgent that it is difficult to predict the outcome. At the same time, the opinion of "breaking the status quo" is also extremely important. Since the government has no affiliated parties in the House of Representatives, and the majority of members in the House of Peers are also opposed to the government (as can be proved by the questions raised by the parties on the first day of the Diet's reopening), general observations here believe that the Cabinet has absolutely no hope of winning, and the act of dissolution is also difficult. It is also believed that the movement to create a new cabinet is currently quite active, attempting to seize the possible opportunity to disintegrate the existing political parties. If this movement is successful, the government, with strong support as its backing, may be able to gather some supporters. Although this hope is not entirely unfounded, it is unlikely to be realized, as organizing a new party is not easy, and obtaining a majority of support is even more difficult. Even if they can obtain some supporters, it will be of no help. Therefore, some people predict that the Hirota Cabinet will ultimately be unable to maintain its position and will be forced to resign after the general election. There are now various speculations about the candidates for the successor to the Cabinet. In short, the goal of this dissolution of the Diet is ambiguous and unclear, and the government's victory is also hopeless. It is generally believed that the goal of dissolving the Diet is inexplicable. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Seiyukai Party</h3>
<p>Resentful of Government's Suppression of Speech Considering Future Actions to Be Taken</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Seiyukai convened an emergency executive meeting at its headquarters at 1:00 PM on the 22nd. The party's elders, advisors, executives, secretary-general, and chairman of the Policy Research Council all attended. Focusing on the issue of the suspension of the Diet, the party unanimously resolved on the following items regarding the party's attitude: (1) The party believes that the Diet being suspended right at the beginning is an act by the government to suppress speech, and there is no greater illegality. (2) In view of the true meaning of constitutional government, cabinet members from our party must not agree to the dissolution of the Diet.</p>
<p>After the meeting passed the above two proposals, it continued to hold an emergency meeting of Diet members at the party headquarters at 2:00 PM, unanimously approving the above resolutions without any objections. The secretary-general then immediately visited the cabinet members from the party, delivered the above resolution documents, and requested that they act in accordance with their consistent policy. (Allied Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Minseito Party Temporarily Adopts a Wait-and-See Approach</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] In order to decide on its attitude towards this dissolution of the Diet, the Minseito Party convened a general affairs meeting at its headquarters at 1:00 PM on the 22nd. Executive personnel all attended. First, Yorimotoki, Minister of Communications, reported on the internal situation of the government. He did not mention the delicate movements within the cabinet, the Minister's own advancement or retreat, or the relationship with the party, remaining completely isolated. Next, Saito Takao argued that what should be questioned by the government should still be questioned, and what should be reviewed should still be reviewed, and then an attitude should be decided. Finally, Koizumi Matajiro spoke of adopting a wait-and-see attitude and not acting rashly, which was endorsed by his colleagues. A meeting of Diet members was convened at 3:00 PM, and Koizumi's views were explained. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. (Allied Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Financial Circles Sympathize with Political Parties</h3>
<p>Oppose Strengthening Dictatorial Politics Public Sentiment Unsettled, Market in Disarray</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Diet, which reopened in a tense atmosphere on the 22nd, has shown a dangerous state due to the unexpectedly tough attitude of the political parties. The government has therefore petitioned for a two-day recess. The impressions received by the financial community, especially the industrial and financial sectors, are generally as follows: The financial community expresses sympathy for the attitude of the political parties and hopes that the huge budget and laws concerning various industries will be thoroughly revised. However, the government's two-day recess has deepened the state of anxiety in the political world, causing a major shock to the financial community, making it difficult to see through the future situation, and paying close attention to the development of the political situation. Since the past three or four years, industrial capitalists who have reaped huge profits by taking advantage of the wartime boom have been greatly alarmed by the government's unprecedented budget of 3 billion yuan. Although Finance Minister Baba's speech yesterday was optimistic about the future of finance, the current state of Japan's industrial economy is actually the opposite of the Finance Minister's speech, proving the fact that it cannot accept the current fiscal policy, and the ruinous phenomenon of malignant inflation is considered a sign that the wartime boom has reached a dangerous point. As a result, the financial community has resolutely adopted a general anti-government attitude, and this influence has affected the tough attitude of the political parties, making them increasingly anti-government. However, the Diet's sudden two-day recess and the instability of the political situation suggest that the financial community has no firm conviction or countermeasures for this. The financial sector has always opposed the government's strengthening of dictatorial politics and its disregard for the sudden policies of the economic sector. At the same time, it is very concerned about the attitude of the political parties and hopes to criticize the current cabinet's administration. However, the sudden deterioration of the political situation has greatly shocked it, and it is now making every effort to avoid the instability of the political situation. However, the stock market and commodity market are inevitably affected to a considerable extent. (Allied Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] It is difficult to predict the future direction of the political situation after the dissolution of the Diet. Although the stock market is currently paying attention to its future, the high prices have led to a continuous sell-off by those who bought at high prices. As a result, mainstay stocks such as New Eastern have fallen from above 150 yuan to 49.10 yuan, a sharp drop of 14 yuan from the high price of 63.60 yuan a day or two ago. Kanebo stocks also fell sharply by around 10 yuan, and other stocks continued to fall to 3 or 5 yuan. As the future of the political situation is unpredictable, public sentiment is extremely shaken. In particular, rumors of the Army Minister's resignation have further fueled the selling pressure. The financial community is generally anxious, and this trend is quite strong.

<h3>The Qingdao Match Merchants' Industry Dispute is Becoming Increasingly Serious</h3>
<p>The Match Joint Office Opposes the Monopoly and Control of the Joint Venture Society, Submitting Appeals to Various Authorities and Sending Representatives for Petitions</p>
<p>A communication from Qingdao reports that the Qingdao branch of the National Match Joint Venture Society is about to be established. However, eighteen match factories including Luxi and Zhendong in Shandong Province are opposing the Qingdao branch of the joint venture, which they believe threatens the industry by monopolizing and controlling it. They have organized a joint office to prepare for resistance. Investigations reveal that the joint office agrees with the principle of establishing a joint venture society. However, they believe that the society's articles of association and the agreements made with foreign merchants contain elements of monopoly, control, and damage to national industry. They have repeatedly petitioned the central, provincial, and municipal authorities to order corrections, but the issue has not been resolved after years of contention. On November 16th and 17th last year, the Ministry of Finance convened a meeting at the Tax Bureau, with representatives from the Ministry of Industry and the Joint Venture Society attending. It was decided that all Chinese match factories that had not joined the joint venture must join by January 20th of this year. Otherwise, the Ministry of Industry would revoke their registration, and the Ministry of Finance would stop selling flower labels and issuing licenses. This decision was telegraphed to the Joint Venture Society headquarters, which forwarded it to the match merchants for compliance. After receiving this notification, the joint office of eighteen factories including Luxi and Zhendong in Shandong Province immediately convened an emergency meeting and decided to struggle and make a final sacrifice. They resolved to submit appeals to the Administrative and Supervisory Yuan, and send declarations of denial to the Ministries of Finance and Industry. They also sent representatives to the provincial and municipal governments to petition. Furthermore, they resolved that if the government did not understand their plight and proceeded to revoke registrations and stop selling flower labels and issuing licenses, leading to factory closures and unemployment, the joint office factories would not be responsible. Observing the current situation, the dispute between the two sides is likely to become increasingly serious. According to statistics, the eighteen factories employ directly and indirectly no less than 100,000 workers. If they are forced to shut down due to this dispute, society will be affected, which is an important issue that cannot be ignored. The petitions submitted by the joint office to various authorities are listed below.</p>
<p>Petition to the Administrative and Supervisory Yuan: Regarding the Match Production and Sales Joint Venture Society's Deceptive Reporting and Threatening of the Industry, a Critical Situation, and the Imminent Risk of Bankruptcy. A Humble Request for a Thorough Investigation and Protection, and an Order to the Relevant Authorities to Modify the Proposal and Seek a Fair and Appropriate Solution to Benefit Manufacturers and Maintain Industry. The eighteen factories unanimously agree with the principle of joint ventures. However, the society's articles of association and the agreements negotiated with Japanese counterparts contain elements of monopoly, control, subservience to foreign interests, and self-inflicted harm, making them difficult to accept. We have already refuted them point by point and submitted opinions in writing, requesting your esteemed Yuan to order a halt to and correction of these issues. However, after years of appeals, our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Our legitimate requests have not been adopted by the society or addressed appropriately by the relevant authorities. The situation is deeply worrying, as it concerns our very survival. We have now received telegram No. 5770 from the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, forwarded by the National Production and Sales Joint Venture Society. Upon reading it, we were extremely perplexed and astonished. The reason why the eighteen factories have been cautiously considering and hesitant to join the joint venture is entirely due to the monopolistic policies of the society, in which powerful manufacturers collude with foreigners to suppress their domestic counterparts. This places the majority of small factories in a position of constant aggression and oppression, unable to breathe freely. Even the Huai Shang Minsheng factories in the Central China region deeply feel the insidious nature of these articles of association and agreements, making it impossible for small factories to survive. The facts are clear and can be proven. However, the society brazenly disregards this, showing no sincerity in repenting its errors. The articles of association are treated as if they were divinely ordained, with not a single word allowed to be modified. The measures are dictated unilaterally, with factories not allowed to express their opinions. They even use the fact that the Sino-Japanese agreement has been filed with the four ministries as their sole means of intimidation, leading to a long-term stalemate in the joint venture. The responsibility for this naturally lies with the society. At the Ministry of Finance meeting on November 16th and 17th last year, only the responsible personnel from the society were invited to attend and explain the situation, without notifying the factories to state their opinions. Since only one side was heard, it is no wonder that the society was able to deceive with false pretenses and malicious speculation. From a rational and reasonable perspective, how can this be considered fair? Furthermore, the so-called separate corrections and necessary rectifications mentioned in the meeting of the Ministries of Finance and Industry only relate to the production ratios of each district and factory and their calculation methods. The telegram does not mention how the articles of association will be modified or whether the agreement can be salvaged. The society's letter also does not mention this. Moreover, what is the extent of the so-called separate corrections? Will the preferential rights of the Japanese side be revoked, and will everyone be treated equally? And have the points that need to be corrected been corrected? And are they suitable for the balanced development of factories of all sizes, without containing monopoly, control, or selfish agendas? This is what we are worried about and cannot understand. The Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, without investigating the nature of this dispute and the reasons why the factories refuse to join, is using coercive means to force all factories to join the joint venture by February 1st. If they fail to join by the deadline, their registrations will be revoked, flower label sales will be stopped, and no further extensions will be granted. This seems to be complying with the requests of the powerful manufacturers in the society, completely disregarding the interests and survival of the eighteen factories, and does not seem to be the government's intention to treat all factories equally. If the society's organization of the joint venture is truly aimed at rescuing the industry, all factories would readily join without the need for government coercion. Otherwise, with so much capital and enterprise at stake, it would be better to struggle and make the ultimate sacrifice than to be forced to join, be controlled by others, and cut off our own means of survival. The factories have repeatedly stated that they will never join the society until its articles of association are corrected. We hope that you will understand that the Ministry of Finance is in charge of tax revenue and protecting manufacturers, while the Ministry of Industry promotes industry and focuses on people's livelihoods. Since we have already been registered, you should be able to clearly understand the reasons and difficulties of the factories that refuse to join and grant us your understanding. If you do not understand the situation and mistakenly believe the society's slanderous remarks that refusing to join is equivalent to opposing the joint venture and attempting to smuggle, and proceed to implement the decision and not grant any further extensions, we will only wait for the government's decision. However, for the sake of the future of industry and the social economy, the stakes are high. The unemployment of hundreds of thousands of workers is an extremely serious problem in the region. At a time when the rural economy is collapsing and the market is depressed, and after repeated disasters, small-scale factories should be encouraged and protected, not subjected to wanton destruction that cuts off their own means of survival. We have always admired your advocacy for industry and focus on people's livelihoods. You would never sit idly by and watch as the factories are manipulated and controlled by capitalists, leading to their demise, without lending a helping hand. The situation is critical, and we are presenting our case. We humbly request your esteemed Yuan to conduct a thorough investigation and protection, and order the relevant authorities to modify the proposal and seek a legitimate solution to benefit manufacturers and maintain industry. The livelihoods of the people and the stability of the region depend on it.</p>
<p>Petition to the Authorities of Shandong and Qingdao: Regarding the Match Joint Venture Society's Deceptive Reporting to the Government and Threatening of the Industry, a Critical Situation, and the Imminent Risk of Bankruptcy. A Humble Request for Prompt Protection and a Forwarding of the Proposal to the Relevant Authorities to Modify the Proposal and Seek a Solution to Benefit Manufacturers and Maintain Industry. The eighteen factories unanimously agree with the principle of joint ventures. However, the society's articles of association and the agreements made with Japanese counterparts contain elements of monopoly, control, subservience to foreign interests, and self-inflicted harm, which should be rectified and corrected to align with the original intention of rescuing the industry. Last year, when Liu Hongsheng came to Qingdao, we personally presented to you the illegal and power-abdicating points in the articles of association and agreements, refuted them point by point, and submitted reasons, requesting your government to provide relief and forward the request to the relevant authorities to order corrections. Whether the articles of association and agreements are fair and reasonable, whether there is truly no selfishness in exclusivity and subservience to foreign interests, and whether the reasons for our refutation are sufficient and have value for consideration, and whether we are truly attempting to subvert the joint venture with other agendas, as the society falsely accuses us of, will become clear through comparison and verification. This is something that Your Excellency will be able to discern clearly and does not need to be repeated. Unexpectedly, our legitimate requests have not been adopted by the society. Even if Your Excellency suggests a compromise between the two sides, Liu Hongsheng will not accept it. The situation is deeply worrying, as it concerns our very survival. On January 9th of this year, we suddenly received a letter from the Joint Venture Society stating that the Ministry of Finance had issued order No. 5770, and that the Ministry had convened a meeting at the Tax Bureau on November 16th and 17th, 1936, with representatives from the Ministry of Industry attending, to conduct a thorough study and impartial review, and had notified the responsible personnel of the society to attend and explain the situation. The two ministries decided that all Chinese match factories that had not joined the joint venture would be granted an extension until January 20th, 1937, and must join the society by February 1st. If any factories still failed to join by February 1st, the Ministry of Industry would revoke their registration, and the Ministry of Finance would stop selling flower labels and issuing licenses, and no further extensions would be granted. We were also informed that the order had been forwarded to the match factories for compliance. Upon reading it, we were extremely perplexed and astonished. The reason why the eighteen factories have been hesitating to join the joint venture is entirely due to the monopolistic policies of the society, in which powerful manufacturers collude with foreigners to suppress their domestic counterparts. This places the majority of small factories in a position of constant aggression and oppression, unable to breathe freely. Even the Huai Shang Minsheng factories in the Central China region deeply feel the insidious nature of these articles of association and agreements, making it impossible for small factories to survive. The facts are clear and known to everyone. However, the society shows no sincerity in repenting its errors and disregards the interests of the factories. Specifically, the society is unwilling to loosen its grip on the restrictions and oppression imposed on the factories through the articles of association and agreements, leading to a long-term stalemate in the joint venture. The responsibility for this naturally lies with the society. At the Ministry of Finance meeting on November 16th and 17th last year, only the responsible personnel from the society were invited to attend and explain the situation, without notifying the factories to state their opinions. Since only one side was heard, it is no wonder that the society was able to deceive with false pretenses and malicious speculation. From a rational and reasonable perspective, how can this be considered fair? Whether the society's articles of association have been corrected, whether the humiliating and power-abdicating points in the agreement have been salvaged, the minutes of the meeting have not been made public, and the society's letter has not notified us. The telegram only mentions that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, based on the above decision, have separately corrected the production ratio calculation tables submitted by the society, and extracted the details of the meeting and the points that need to be corrected, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing. How exactly are the calculation tables corrected? Will the Japanese merchants' increased production quotas be revoked, and will everyone be treated equally? And have the points that need to be corrected been corrected? And are they suitable for the balanced development of factories of all sizes, without containing monopoly, control, or selfish agendas? This is what we are worried about and cannot understand. However, the previous decision of the Ministries of Finance and Industry, in order to rescue the match industry and prevent smuggling and tax evasion, forces all factories to join the joint venture and revokes the registrations and stops the sale of flower labels for those who do not join by the deadline, so that the powerful manufacturers in the society can exploit them at will, while disregarding the interests and survival of the eighteen factories. This does not seem to be the government's intention to treat all factories equally. If the powerful manufacturers in the society and their articles of association and agreements truly aim to rescue the industry, all factories would readily join without the need for government coercion. Otherwise, with so much capital and enterprise at stake, it would be better to struggle and make the ultimate sacrifice than to be forced to join, be controlled by others, and cut off our own means of survival. The factories have repeatedly stated that they will never join the society until its articles of association are corrected. We hope that you will understand that the Ministry of Finance is in charge of tax revenue and protecting manufacturers, while the Ministry of Industry promotes industry and focuses on people's livelihoods. Since we have already been registered, you should be able to clearly understand the reasons and difficulties of the factories that refuse to join and grant us your understanding. If you do not understand the situation and mistakenly believe the society's slanderous remarks that we are opposing the joint venture and have other agendas, and proceed to revoke our registrations and stop the sale of flower labels without granting any extensions, the eighteen factories are financially weak and can only wait for the government's decision. However, for the sake of the future of industry and the social economy, the stakes are high. The unemployment of hundreds of thousands of workers is an extremely serious problem in the province and city. The factories will have unspeakable suffering. We have always admired our Chairman and Mayor for their care for manufacturers and their great concern. At a time when factories are being subjected to hardship and suppression, you would never sit idly by and watch as the eighteen factories are manipulated and controlled by capitalists, leading to their demise, without lending a helping hand. The situation is critical, and we are presenting our case. We humbly request Your Excellency to grant us protection and promptly consult with the relevant authorities to modify the proposal and seek a legitimate solution to benefit manufacturers and maintain industry. The livelihoods of the people and the stability of the region depend on it.</p>
<h3>Engineering Conditions of the Xuan-Gui Section of the Nanjing-Jiangxi Railway</h3>
<p>The Engineering Bureau Sends Personnel to Inspect the Road and Bridges Along the Line. Construction of the Southern Qimen Road Can Also Begin Within Days.</p>
<p>A communication from Tunxi reports that the Jing-Quzhou Railway, which connects the Jiangnan and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways, was changed to the Nanjing-Jiangxi Railway after Quzhou was abandoned. Except for the section from Nanjing to Sunjiabu in Xuancheng, which has already been opened to traffic, the northern section of the road from Ningguo to Qimen is progressing rapidly. It is scheduled to be completed from Ningguo to Xiuning by March of this year. The eastern part of Xuxi has already been built. The eighth section from Huizhou to Yansi has also started construction. The ninth section from Yansi (in Shexian County) to Xiuning is also being prepared. The Engineering Bureau of the Xuancheng-Guixi section, in order to understand the route and bridges along the line so as to speed up construction, recently sent engineers Wang Huaiyong and Li Rongzhai to Xiuning to inspect the tenth section from Xiuning to Yuting (in the territory of Huoxian County) and the eleventh section from Yuting to Jinzipai (in the territory of Qimen County). Construction of the southern Qimen road at Houtan, Guixi, Rongkou, and Daohu can begin within 20 days. Recently, the General Engineering Bureau shipped various materials to Qimen. The Twelfth Engineering Office of the fourth and fifth teams stationed in Qimen has hired a large number of road workers, about 10,000 people, from Beiping to wait for instructions. However, the northern section of the road from Ningguo to Xiuning will soon be laid with tracks, requiring a large number of sleepers. The Shexian sleeper procurement office plans to purchase a total of 10,000 sleepers, with each timber merchant responsible for procuring them separately, with 20% to be delivered in March and 40% in each of April and May (January 18th).</p>
<h3>Suzhou Urges the Remittance of 200,000 Provincial Funds</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, with the Lunar New Year approaching and the province urgently in need of funds, specially sent Su Cengyi to Suzhou on the 22nd to urge the county government to remit 200,000 yuan in provincial funds. After negotiations with County Magistrate Deng, it was agreed that 200,000 yuan would be remitted before the end of January. After completing his mission, Su went to Kunshan that night to also urge the remittance of provincial funds.</p>
<p>Borrowing Funds to Build a New Suzhou</p>
<p>The Wuxian Construction Bureau, regarding the major construction plan for the Wuxian urban area this year, the reconstruction of the four city gates of Xu, Pan, Lou, and Qi, the opening and widening of major trunk roads in the city, and the reconstruction of bridges, estimates that the total cost will be over 290,000 yuan. The plan has been approved by the Department of Construction, and the necessary funds have been approved to be borrowed from various banks. The funds will be repaid in installments of 80,000 yuan per year under the Wuxian construction fund. In order to actively proceed, the county government has scheduled a meeting for the morning of the 23rd, convening the managers of six banks, including Jiangsu, China, Communications, Land, Farmers, to negotiate the loan. Once the procedures are completed and the funds are handed over, construction must begin as soon as possible, with the aim of completing it before the Double Tenth Festival this year.</p>
<p>The Water Police Sends Warships to Suppress Lake Bandits</p>
<p>Zhou Weilie, the commander of the second district of the water police, because there have recently been large gangs of lake bandits plotting to disturb the villages of counties along Taihu Lake, such as Wuxing, specially sent Inspector Xue Zhichao on the evening of the 21st, leading a fleet of warships, to patrol the area along Taihu Lake day and night, and to suppress the lake bandits at the opportune time. At the same time, it is reported that the Zhejiang water police have also sent teams to intercept them.</p>
<h3>Twelve Passengers Injured in a Car Accident in Jiading</h3>
<p>At 11:10 AM on the 21st, a No. 17 car of the Shanghai-Taicang Automobile Company, which was traveling from Jiading to Shanghai, had heavy objects placed on the roof. The driver, a certain Jia, neglected his duties and allowed a certain coppersmith who did not know the technology of repairing cars to drive. When the car reached near Shi Xiang Gong Beng, the car drove into a ditch on the side of the road, and the car overturned. Twelve passengers were injured. Two old men and women had fractured skulls and were bleeding, fearing for their lives. In addition, nine other people were seriously injured, all of whom were sent to Shanghai and Yegouqiao Taijiabao Relief Hospital for treatment. One person who was slightly injured returned to the city by car and was treated by the Jiading Hospital and has been discharged.</p>
<h3>Two Accountants from the Changzhou County Bureau Go Missing</h3>
<p>Wu Nan (Zi Ziwen), the accountant of the Wuyi Education Bureau, is over 60 years old and has been working in the bureau for over ten years. Recently, due to heavy personal consumption, he embezzled the education funds he was in charge of. Over time, by the end of 1935, he owed as much as 12,000 yuan. The bureau did not notice. Starting in 1936, Jin Guoping was reassigned by the Department of Education to fill the position of accountant in the Education Bureau. Wu, unable to make up the shortfall and hand over the accounts, fled on the 15th of this month as the Lunar New Year approached. The bureau is investigating. At the same time, his son Wu Ruihua, who was the treasurer of the county government (also the accountant), who usually handled a large amount of money and was always conscientious, unexpectedly fled on the 17th of this month. Before leaving, he left a note in the office that read, "Alas! Alas! Alas! From now on, the world will have one less honest person." Afterwards, the county government summoned his guarantor to the government, and together they liquidated the funds he had handled. It was not easy to clarify for a while. The position of treasurer of the First Section has been temporarily filled by Zhuge Cheng. It is also reported that Wu Nan, the accountant of the Education Bureau, and Wu Ruihua, the treasurer of the county government (Wu Nan's son), have successively embezzled funds and fled. Wu Nan has been in the bureau for more than ten years. The director has changed nine times, but the accountant has not been changed, so there is no guarantor. The embezzlement is about 12,000 yuan. Director Sun Youguang telegraphed the county government and forwarded it to the Department of Education, requesting that personnel be sent to investigate thoroughly and requesting punishment himself. The county government has ordered Director Sun to find out Wu Nan's property in order to seal it up. The Department of Education immediately sent staff members Zhu Maogong and Rui Jun to Changzhou on the 21st. They inspected the accounts at the Education Bureau on the 22nd and will stay for several days. His son, Wu Ruihua, also has a deficit in the county government. The county government has summoned his guarantor, Yang Gansheng, to take care of it. Yang agreed to find a way to be responsible for repayment. However, the amount of the deficit has not yet been clarified. The county magistrate took a car to the province early on the morning of the 22nd to ask for instructions on how to handle it.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Sends Personnel to Inspect Kala-Azar</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government established the Huaiyin District Kala-Azar Prevention and Treatment Team last year, setting up the headquarters in Lianshui, and nine sub-teams in the territory of Siyang, Suqian, and Huaian, each sub-team under the jurisdiction of five prevention and treatment stations, spreading throughout the countryside. The Kala-Azar sufferers in northern Jiangsu, who had been suffering from the disease for a long time, have finally received the relief of modern medicine. It is now learned that the Department of Civil Affairs, in order to investigate the actual situation of the prevalence of Kala-Azar and the prevention and treatment situation, has specially joined forces with the Provincial Hospital to send personnel to the epidemic area to conduct inspections. It is reported that Shao Tizhang of the Department of Civil Affairs and Li Zihang and Song Jinzhang of the Medical and Political College have already set off north yesterday. The inspection period is about one month.</p>
<h3>Nantong Water Police Intercepts Sea Bandits</h3>
<p>Several bandit ships were discovered on the sea off Xinyangkou, a salt-producing area, with more than 300 bandits. After being suppressed by the third brigade of the Yancheng water police, the bandit ships fled south. Zhu Aizhou, the commander of the third district of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, specially dispatched the first and second brigades stationed in Lusi and Chongming to the sea to intercept them.</p>
<p>Judgment in the Dongxiang Murder Case</p>
<p>Xu Defu, a native of the county, was doing business in Shanghai. His wife, Jiang Cuie, had romantic affairs in Yiyu, Dongxiang. Her adultery was discovered by Xu Decheng, the husband's elder brother, which led to a grudge. She brutally murdered Xu Decheng. The case was solved by the district office, and the male and female criminals were handed over to the court. On the 21st, Judge Liu of the criminal court concluded the trial. Jiang Yuxian was sentenced to death, and Jiang Cuie and Jiang Mingzhu were sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Patrol Boats Patrol Guajiang in Groups</h3>
<p>Wu Jiqing, the commander of the fourth district of the Provincial Water Police, in order to ensure the safety of winter defense, specially ordered the troops stationed in various places to diligently patrol the defense area day and night to ensure the public security of the waters, and to liaise and rendezvous with the land police. He also ordered the special forces directly under the district to divide the patrol boats into groups responsible for patrolling the waters of Guazhoukou day and night, to strictly prevent bandits from entering by water and disturbing the residents along the river and the merchants traveling back and forth.</p>
<h3>Lead-Pencil Mine Discovered in the Western Countryside of Haizhou</h3>
<p>The western countryside of this county is rich in mineral resources. In addition to the phosphorous mine in Qushan and the mica mine in Qinglongshan, which are being mined, a lead-pencil mine has now been discovered in Shuanghu Township, the fifth district, which is 100 miles away from the county seat. The surrounding area occupies more than ten hectares. Recently, merchants from the county seat, such as Fu Xiayun, have raised funds to prepare for mining, and have drawn a map of the mining area and submitted it to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction and the Ministry of Industry for filing. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction sent technician Zhang Yi to the mine in Haizhou for inspection. Before leaving, technician Zhang packed several bags of lead-pencil produced in the mine and took them to Zhenjiang for chemical testing. Fu and others are waiting for the approval of the Department of Construction and the issuance of the mining license before starting construction.</p>
<h3>Ningbo National Woodcut Exhibition</h3>

<h3>Zi Lin Cup Final Today: Youyou and Measurement Vie for the Championship</h3>
<p>The Match will be at 2:30 PM at the Hongkou Park Stadium. In Group A, Jinnan Faces Portuguese Merchants, and Western Merchants Changed to Fighting St. Francis.</p>
<p>The two teams, Youyou and Measurement, which have won the right to compete in the Zi Lin Cup final, are scheduled to hold the final at the first stadium of Hongkou Park at 2:30 PM this afternoon. Youyou has had a good record since it started the competition. In the semi-finals, it defeated its only strong rival, Zhen Dan. At the same time, the Russian army, which formed a three-legged stance, was resolved by the Measurement team, which was unknown in the league, indirectly providing Youyou with a lot of convenience. The Russian army's record in the league is above Youyou's. Now that it has been eliminated by the Measurement team, and Youyou's strength is far beyond that of the Measurement team, Youyou can rest assured about the championship. There are three matches in Group A of the Western League today. The match between Western Police and Su Keer is expected to be a tough battle because Gaxu Dang will be absent. Although the Portuguese army is in decline, Jinnan Wang Nanzhen, Yin Guiren, Yan Lianjin, and other pillars are now on a grand tour to the south. It is bound to be supplemented by Group B players, so the victory may belong to the Portuguese merchants. In another match, the Western Merchants were originally scheduled to play against Lax. Because three players from the Lax team were selected for the inter-port competition, it will be difficult to attend the league at that time. Therefore, Western Merchants changed to fighting St. Francis. There is also a Group C match, between Yousheng and Savaia. The Savaia team has already won the championship in Group C, but Yousheng has also been very aggressive recently and has the ambition to defeat the Savaia team. The schedule and lineups of each team today are as follows:</p>
<p>Youyou Team (Zi Cup Final)</p>
<p>Yousheng Team (Against Savaia)</p>

<h3>News Communication Fails, Five Dragons Triumph</h3>
<p>26 to 17 – Five Dragons Always Ahead</p>
<p>Originally, there were two basketball games scheduled for yesterday at Zhongyuan. However, the Division B Group 1 match between the Yidui team and Moore, scheduled for 6:30 PM, was postponed. Only the Group A game between Five Dragons and News Communication took place. News Communication recently gained success against Xiqing and didn't take Five Dragons seriously. Consequently, Lan Yin, Pisele, Shi Guiya, and others didn't play. However, Five Dragons was not a weak team. Wu Bixian and Xu Zhaoxiong coordinated their play with incredible skill, preventing Carson from performing effectively. After the match began, Xu Zhaoxiong scored first, followed by two baskets from Wu Bixian. Then, Wang Zhenlun added one free throw, giving Five Dragons a 7-0 lead. Although News Communication had Carson coordinating in the center, they were unsuccessful due to Five Dragons' tight defense. At 5-0, they urgently replaced Mao Nai with Walter, but it didn't help. When Lie Jingfeng committed a foul, Walter scored two free throws, finally adding some points to the scoreboard. Afterwards, Li Zude scored a basket, and Carson also contributed. Wu Bixian scored again, and Walter retaliated in kind, bringing the score to 11-6, with Five Dragons still leading by five points. The situation seemed quite balanced. Soon after, Li Zude scored two more free throws, and Pan Sisi also scored one out of two free throws. Time flew by, and the halftime break arrived. Five Dragons led 13-7 in the first half. In the second half, Wu Bixian successfully scored from the perimeter. Walter missed both free throws. After Carson scored, the veteran Nai Bo'er was brought on to replace Pan Ensi, but it didn't improve the situation. For Five Dragons, Xu Zhaoxiong scored a free throw, and Li Zude scored another basket. Lan Jin was unhappy with the referee Zhang Wenyuan, resulting in a technical foul. Xu Zhaoxiong missed the free throw. With victory in sight, Five Dragons called a timeout to maintain their lead. However, after the game resumed, News Communication attacked fiercely, resulting in numerous fouls on both sides. After Mao Nai scored a free throw, Xu and Liu quickly scored three points, bringing the score to 21-10, with Five Dragons holding a clear advantage. Later, Lan Jin and Li Zude each scored. News Communication then brought on Fusi Tuo. With only five minutes remaining, Li and Fusi Tuo each scored a free throw. Wu Bixian scored under the basket, and Carson also made a solo dash and scored. With even less time remaining, only one minute, Five Dragons, having secured the victory, replaced Xu, Wang, and Li with Zhao Shouchang, Wu Bixin, and Zhou Xuexian for rest. After Carson scored, the final buzzer sounded loudly. In the end, Five Dragons won decisively with a score of 26-17. This was the first time News Communication had lost in Shanghai, except for a loss to a visiting team.</p>

<h3>Amateur Billiards Group A Competition: Zhang Yingda Achieves Great Victory</h3>
<p>Demonstrates Divine Skills, Securing Qualification for the Replay – Wins Against Wu Chengqi with 1000 to 571</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda, a leading figure in Chinese billiards, showcased extraordinary skills in two matches yesterday, defeating Wu Chengqi (previously mistakenly reported as Wu Chengxiang) with a score of 1000 to 571 in the Group A billiards championship, securing qualification for the replay.</p>
<p>Zhang's performance in the first half was already excellent, but his fluency and mastery in the second half were truly rare. With a cue in hand, he could do whatever he wanted. The ball would fall as he desired, and openings and other techniques were all under his control. He scored every time, and missing a shot became a rare occurrence. This was truly a masterpiece of Zhang's life. Wu's performance was less stable in the second half than in the first half, but his shots in the middle of the first half were even more brilliant. If he could have continued like that, he would have provided Zhang with a strong competition.</p>
<p>After Zhang scored 27, 29, and 26 in the first three shots, he took the lead. However, he faltered midway, giving Wu a good opportunity to accelerate and catch up. With a 40-point shot, Wu took the lead with 184 to 130. Later, Zhang regained the lead with 207 to 178. After that, it was all Zhang's show. Wu could only try to follow, hoping not to fall too far behind. At the end of the first half, Zhang had 500 points and Wu had 360.</p>
<p>The second half passed smoothly in a one-sided manner. Wu was constantly plagued by bad luck, unable to develop all his skills. Watching Zhang's miraculous shots, every shot was a revelation, and every time there was a way to score. Scores of 20 or more were achieved very easily. Occasionally, Zhang was careless, but good luck would help him, and he would always gain something. Therefore, it only took one and a half hours to reach 500 points.</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda (First Half): 27, 29, 48, 37, 32, 49, 30, 20, 30, 42. (Second Half): 41, 49, 25, 45, 43, 39, 60, 22. Wu Chengqi (First Half): 40, 40. (Second Half): 20, 26, 35.</p>

<h3>The Return of Students Studying in Japan Faces Problems</h3>
<p>Those Who Have Not Obtained a Study Abroad Certificate Are Not Considered Students by the State – Japanese Students' Association Asks the Ministry of Education to Issue Certificates</p>
<p>(Tokyo Special Dispatch) Since the qualification issue of our students studying in Japan occurred, students studying in Japan have been running around all day.

The Federation of Chinese Students Studying in Japan also requested the Ministry of Education to revise the regulations on restrictions on students studying in Japan. The situations of all parties are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Request to the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>In order to request the Ministry of Education to revise the regulations on restrictions on students studying in Japan, the Federation of Chinese Students Studying in Japan has explored the main points as follows (the original text is very long. For the sake of economic space, its main points are recorded as follows): ㊀ All Chinese students who have studied at schools in Japan, whether or not they have obtained a study abroad certificate, shall be recognized for their academic qualifications and shall be issued a certificate. ㊁ All Chinese students who have graduated from schools in Japan, whether or not they have obtained a study abroad certificate, shall be recognized for their graduation qualifications and shall be issued a certificate. More than two-thirds of all students studying in Japan have not obtained a study abroad certificate. Can the majority of students be ignored? Can the results of the hard work of the majority of students studying in Japan for several years still have no guarantee of life? Therefore, in addition to the above-mentioned main tasks, the Association also has two tasks: First, to request our country's educational institutions and other competent authorities in Japan to effectively protect the safety of all students studying in Japan; Second, to request our country's educational institutions and other competent authorities in Japan to give all students as much freedom as possible in cultural activities and academic research. In order to realize the latter two requirements, it is necessary to first obtain the formal and legal qualifications of students studying abroad (omitted below).</p>

Unexpectedly, when the class started yesterday, many people joined the school. Those who are enthusiastic about promoting the second form of the national language alphabet, national language Romanization, and a Japanese man from the Institute of Business were also among the students.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Large Investors Suddenly Dump Huge Amounts - Class A Plunges Nearly a Yuan This Month</p>
<p>Other Prices Fluctuate Slightly Based on Supply and Demand</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was quite lively due to the upcoming settlement period. The market atmosphere was firm and stable. Although there was a significant amount of selling by large investors, there were also many buyers, resulting in a very balanced and smooth flow of chips on the trading floor. Market prices also fluctuated slightly. Large investors suddenly dumped huge amounts, causing market prices to plunge by more than a yuan. Later, due to increased buying interest from retail investors, prices recovered slightly. Today is the last two days of the current month's contract. The battle between bulls and bears is expected to be intense. In the morning, the market opened with calm sentiment, and many retail investors also engaged in deferred transactions. Prices of classes E and D fluctuated by only a few cents. However, when a large amount of classes A, 54, and 10 were suddenly dumped, the market plunged by as much as 50 to 60 cents. In the second session, the market gradually weakened. Number 50 saw selling at every level, and numbers 23 and 37 saw a surge in deferred transactions. Number 35, however, absorbed a significant amount. Classes E and C fell back by 10 to 20 cents. Class A near-term continued to fall by 50.5 cents due to selling of number 77. In the afternoon, bulls and bears competed fiercely. Numbers 35 and 4 saw significant buying, and number 38 saw a lot of deferred transactions. Classes D and B rose slightly by 10 cents, while classes E, C, and A rebounded by 10 to 20 cents. At the close, buying interest revived, and buying of numbers 5 and 35 became more intense. Number 50 was still being sold. Market prices uniformly rose by 10 to 20 cents. Overall, classes E and C for next month rose by 10 to 30 cents, while the rest fell by 10 to 30 cents. Class A for the current month fell by a substantial 80.5 cents. The total trading volume was 8,715,000 yuan. The price fluctuations and highs and lows are compared in the table on the left. (Unit: Yuan; Trading Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>April Flour also Enters the 4-Yuan Range</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw prices rise first and then fall in the morning. As overseas wheat prices were reported to be up 48 points in Chicago, up 12 cents in Canada, and up 1 penny in Liverpool, prices opened higher, with market sentiment naturally boosted by the slightly higher overseas wheat prices, rising by 1 to 2 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. However, in the second session, the near-term remained stable, while the far-term saw little activity from both traders and buyers, and many who had profited took their gains, causing market sentiment to weaken again. By the afternoon, market sentiment took a sharp turn downwards. The current month saw short covering due to the approaching settlement date, while the far-term was dampened by the weak wheat market and the poor quality of current wheat, causing selling pressure to increase. Prices fell by 2, 3, and 4 cents for all months. As the settlement date is approaching, actual buyers are expecting a positive result, so the subsequent trend should be stable.</p>
<p>Millers' Buying is Very Sluggish - Wheat Futures Fall Back by About 10 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw near-term weakness and far-term firmness in the morning. Due to the upcoming settlement date, millers' buying interest was very sluggish, causing market sentiment to be weak. Far-term months saw market sentiment turn firm due to slightly higher overseas wheat prices. However, due to limited buyer interest, although prices initially rose by 3 to 4 cents, they later fell back. By the afternoon, the current month saw significant short covering, and rumors that millers were unwilling to accept the goods prepared for delivery by the bulls caused market sentiment to become even more bearish, causing prices to fall back by 12 cents. The far-term saw increased selling pressure due to the declining flour market, causing prices to fall by nearly 10 cents. The spot wheat market saw the standard price fall again, making it difficult to improve. Jiangbei wheat had fallen to 6.18 yuan, and Tiantai Shaoxing wheat was only 6.1 yuan. Approximately 3,000 bags were opened for sale. It is reported that millers need the price to fall to the 6-yuan level before buying interest can be stronger.</p>
<p>River Rice Market Down Slightly Again</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of more than 40 vessels arrived from various regions, carrying approximately 8,700 to 8,800 piculs of goods. Among them, 25 to 26 vessels carried thin rice. The thin rice market situation remained weak. As both street sales and bulk purchases were sluggish, with Qingdao merchants only buying approximately 2,000 bags, the market price fell slightly again. Thick japonica rice remained stable. Doyang pointed rice also saw little fluctuation. Yin Bian Yuan's supply exceeded demand, causing it to fall by -10 cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 31 to 32 vessels arrived from various regions downriver. Demand for various types of goods in the market was weak. White japonica rice was sluggish, with prices falling by a small number of cents to a slight drop. Early rice also showed signs of softening. Arrivals and sales of thin rice were balanced, with prices stable. Sheep pointed rice saw slightly more activity, with prices tightly pegged by a few cents. Du Bu customer pointed and white yuan saw average demand, with market situation stable.</p>
<p>Husked Rice and Polished Rice - Guangdong and Shantou Merchants Still Purchasing</p>
<p>Yesterday, the digestion of husked and polished rice was still good. Although cargo owners and brokers urgently sought to sell, the market was still able to support the prices. Although the demand from Guangdong merchants was not as strong as in previous days, there was still demand for 6,000 to 7,000 piculs of husked and polished rice. Shantou merchants also made some small purchases. Arrivals have been gradually decreasing recently. Some brokers are planning to adopt a passive approach and wait for a rally before resuming inquiries. The market may be able to remain stable. Today, 7,500 bags of Jiangxi rice, 5,000 bags of Hunan rice, 2,500 bags of Han husked rice, 1,050 bags of Wen Yong rice, and 100 bags of large squeezed rice were opened for sale.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Re-exported Coarse White Sugar Falls by 10 Cents</p>
<p>Several Thousand Bags of Hainan Red Sugar to Arrive Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended weaker. The official association's price for Class 24 coarse white sugar spot was still 23.3 yuan, but no transactions took place. Re-exported goods were traded at 7.65 yuan, with slightly more transactions. The original price of Dong white remained unchanged. There were more sellers than buyers. Mian white sugar from the local factory, Dahua Jinxin No. 1, was priced at 22.3 yuan. Numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 were discounted by 20 cents each. It is reported that several thousand bags of Hainan red sugar will arrive on the Jia Ying wheel today.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods</h3>
<p>Shallow River Water Levels Lead to Few Arrivals of Wood Ear Fungus</p>
<p>Selling Price of Sichuan Wood Ear Fungus Rises Again by 8 Yuan - Production Price of He Kou and Xing An Wood Ear Fungus Also Increases</p>
<p>Due to the shallow water levels in the Yangtze River, there have been very few arrivals of wood ear fungus, leading to repeated price increases. Yesterday, Sichuan wood ear fungus shops opened at 138 yuan for Eight-Link, an increase of 8 yuan compared to the previous day. At the same time, a telegram from Hankou reported that the production price of He Kou and Xing An wood ear fungus had also risen to 117 yuan, an increase of nearly 5 yuan. The trend is still tight, with signs of continued increases. The market price of Dingsheng Aviation brand small-package wood ear fungus was quoted at 136 yuan, a slight decrease.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Local Factory's Fine Cloth Prices are Surprisingly High</p>
<p>Ample Inventory of Fine Twill is Still Unable to Support Prices - Large Dong Piece White Goods Merchants Prepare to Advance Funds</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was flat. As yarn prices remained strong, prices for spring-season colored goods, poplin, linen, and far-term white goods, coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, and grey cloth were all higher than spot prices. Although current sales to customers are intermittent and very sluggish, this is a normal situation before the end of the settlement. Dong Piece white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill have seen significant consecutive price declines. Most retail merchants have already released their goods. Many large merchants are advocating not to sell and are fully prepared to advance funds at the end of the month, so their intentions are firm. Yesterday, fine cloth and grey cloth were quoted 5 cents higher per piece. Fine twill saw mixed price movements, with only a 5 to 7 cent range. The overall trend was flat. Most transactions were still with local and inland merchants, with approximately 300 bags transacted. Local factory's fine cloth prices were surprisingly high, but fine twill was still unable to support prices. With a large inventory, sales volume exceeded fine cloth by 5 to 6 times, so the market trend continued to be soft, with uneven selling prices. Most of the goods were for local and various customer group dyeing factories and gray cloth factories. Guangdong merchants gradually started to purchase, with a total of more than 400 pieces transacted, mostly for spot and current month goods. The Shandong and Yangtze merchant groups' business in patterned goods and colored goods became quiet. Printed goods, colored cloth, poplin, and woolen cloth markets were firm. Bleached cloth and yarn poplin grey cloth were particularly popular.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Foreign Silk Prices Fall Back - Silk Dealers Mostly Seek to Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market turned downward. Silk prices in Japan and the US fell back again. Yokohama spot prices fell by 17 yuan, and futures prices fell by 27 yuan. New York near-term fell by a small 5 points, and far-term fell by 5.5 points. Lyon silk fell by half a franc. The remaining silk products were able to maintain their original prices. The Shanghai silk market also trended weaker. Although many manufacturers remained firm, most dealers sold. Therefore, yesterday, foreign firms had some transactions. American firms' silk prices fell by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. London firms' prices were quite good. For example, the price of 50 tans of Yongyu Jinfeng Tai brand white factory silk was 855 yuan, which was a clear example. User silk with a fineness of 7-8 sold for 820 yuan, which seemed firmer than foreign firms' prices. A total of 153 bales were sold yesterday.</p>
<p>Raw Silk Exports Decrease in the First Half of January</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Silk Division of the Ministry of Industry, raw silk exports from Shanghai in the first half of January saw a significant decrease compared to the second half of the previous month. This period's exports included 968 bales to Europe, 530 bales to the US, 100 bales to India, and 216 bales to other ports, for a total of 1,814 bales. This was a decrease of 1,788 bales compared to the second half of the previous month. It is understood that this was due to fewer goods being released by foreign and silk merchants before the New Year on the 15th. The silk prices during this period were better than before. According to the average prices of various types of silk released by the Bureau for the first half of the month before the 15th, there were significant increases compared to before. The average price of high-grade white factory silk was 930 yuan, A-grade 13.15 was 900 yuan, B-grade was 850 yuan, B-grade 16.22 rough texture was 820 yuan, grey warp was 400 yuan, and zhili was 700 yuan. The details of various types of silk and the destinations are listed below for reference.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Low-Grade American Cotton Weaker at Origin</p>
<p>Yesterday's opening of the American cotton market saw slow trading. Most transactions were between fellow traders. Due to good news from Liverpool and favorable conditions in the yarn and cloth market, factories actively bought, with all months rising by 1 to 6 pounds sterling. Foreign merchants sold near-term and bought far-term, while spot merchants did the opposite. However, the price for the March contract still encountered resistance at 12.5 cents. Current sales were better. Low-grade cotton was weaker at origin. The closing was firm. Spot prices fell by 3 pounds sterling, and futures prices fell by 1 pound sterling to rising by 3 pounds sterling. English cotton spot prices rose by 6 points, and futures prices rose by 2 to 3 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to selling by cotton farmers and futures traders, but later rebounded due to buying by fellow traders. Smooth fruit rose by 1 to 1.5 rupees, Oomra rose by 2 to 3 rupees, and Belarose rose by 1 to 1.25 rupees. Original telegrams are recorded on the left (telegram of the 21st).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 22nd was: Belarose at 227 rupees, down half a rupee; Oomra at 206.5 rupees; Smooth Fruit at 179 rupees, down 0.25 rupees.</p>

<h3>Wartime Finance (Continued from Previous Issue)</h3>
<p>— Xi Dongshu</p>
<p>(II) Inheritance Tax: This tax is a type of wealth tax, levied once on the inheritance received by the heir. It is most consistent with the principle of fair tax burden and can use progressive tax rates. The United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries have been implementing this tax for a long time. We should implement it as soon as possible to complete the organization of this tax so that it can be fully utilized in the future.</p>
<p>(III) Wartime Profit Tax: During the European War, major countries all levied a type of wartime profit tax. When countless people are sacrificing their lives on the battlefield during wartime, a portion of people are instead reaping extra profits due to the government's massive purchases of materials and the sharp rise in the prices of necessities. The government should seize this type of unexpected gain. The United Kingdom and the United States both collect 80% of wartime profits tax, while France collects 60%. We should also adopt this tax during these extraordinary times.</p>
<p>(IV) Excess Profits Tax: The United States will implement this tax, using industrial and commercial organizations as the unit. For example, an annual interest rate of 8% is first listed as the standard profit. If it exceeds this level, then an excess profits tax is levied. The procedure for collecting this tax is more complicated.</p>
<p>(V) Temporary Property Tax: This tax is a one-time levy from personal property. On a certain date, a heavy tax is levied on the assets of individuals who exceed a certain limit. It is either paid in one lump sum or paid in installments. This is a pure tax on the property itself and is not based on annual income. This tax can limit the formation of small assets and enable the government to collect a large sum within a certain period. Germany has implemented a type of "Imperial Emergency Sacrifice Tax", which belongs to this category. This tax has not yet been widely adopted, but it can be reserved for use in emergencies. In terms of our current economic environment, the direct tax that can be utilized to the greatest extent is income tax, followed by wartime profit tax and inheritance tax.</p>
<p>In addition to increasing these types of direct taxes, the following methods can also be used to enrich the national treasury:</p>
<p>1. Price increases for state-owned enterprises: State-owned enterprises such as telecommunications, postal services, railways, and shipping can increase prices as much as possible, and tax collection is very fast.</p>
<p>2. Special consumption tax and increased entertainment donations: A special tax can be levied on all luxury goods, such as tobacco, alcohol, clocks, watches, motorcycles, and cosmetics. Membership fees and entrance tickets to entertainment venues can also be taxed. The burden of this type of tax falls on people with economic capabilities and does not hinder the lives of ordinary people. Taxes can be levied as much as possible on all consumption that contains luxury.</p>
<p>3. Increase in stamp tax, registration tax, business tax, etc.</p>
<p>4. Exemption tax: A corresponding tax amount can be levied on nationals who are subject to conscription but do not want to participate in the war.</p>
<p>5. Voluntary donations: People can be encouraged to donate during wartime, such as patriotic donations, national salvation donations, national defense donations, aviation donations, and food-saving donations.</p>
<p>6. Foreign debt: It is best to borrow foreign debt during wartime so as not to shake the domestic economy and immediately obtain a large supply of materials. They can then be repaid with materials in the future. This is the most beneficial to wartime finance, especially for our agricultural country. We must obtain the supply of foreign materials. Fearing economic blockade during the war, it is best to borrow more foreign debt before the war breaks out, but this also depends on the international environment.</p>
<p>In short, in addition to being able to utilize foreign debt, we should actively utilize various taxes to cover war expenses and utilize domestic debt as a regulator. Wartime public bonds must still be sold to the public and cannot be used as a reserve for issuing banknotes. Otherwise, as soon as public bonds are issued, banknotes will follow, creating extreme inflation, which will inevitably make our currency follow in the footsteps of the mark and the ruble. However, at the beginning of the war, new tax revenues have not yet flowed into the national treasury, and public bonds have not yet been issued. It is necessary to obtain emergency financing and temporary assistance from the national bank, but it cannot be regarded as a permanent policy to make the national bank provide unlimited supplies. As soon as the war begins, the government should make fundamental plans to increase taxes or borrow from the people.</p>
<p>War is a huge waste of human and material resources. When the fate of the country and the survival of the nation are decided by the victory or defeat of the war, countless compatriots will not hesitate to sacrifice their lives. All nationals with economic capabilities, in addition to maintaining the lowest standard of living, should make economic sacrifices as much as possible. Because if the war is lost, everything cannot be enjoyed. If the war is won, the nation can survive, the country's position can be improved, and the individual's economy can also be improved. Therefore, we should make all kinds of sacrifices in wartime in order to seek the final victory, and we should accept and support the various taxes and domestic debts implemented by the government for the war with the greatest enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Of course, war can be avoided if it can be avoided. In the event that it becomes unavoidable, the big problem is finance. There must be full preparation so that the war is not affected in the slightest. It is necessary to know that the methods of raising funds in extraordinary times are somewhat rigid and are different from peacetime financial management. If there are adequate preparations, it will not be a problem. Suppose that monthly war expenses are 200 million yuan, then the annual expenditure will be 2.4 billion yuan. If one-quarter, or 600 million yuan, comes from new tax revenues, then the remaining three-quarters, or 1.8 billion yuan, will naturally have to rely on public bonds. Our current per capita public debt burden is still less than 13 yuan, which is a very small number compared to the countries of the world. If allocated according to the proportion of the population, these 1.8 billion yuan in public bonds will only increase the burden by 4 yuan per person. Even if this amount of public bonds is issued again in the second year, it will only increase the burden by 8 yuan per person. Now that China is completely unified internally, and the author understands the patriotic thoughts of the general public and the enthusiasm for supporting military leaders, I believe that wartime finance can definitely be carried out smoothly. As for the new tax system and the methods of public bonds, there is no need to explain them in detail now. Today, I will just put forward an outline for you to use as a reference. (End)</p>

<h3>Prospects for the Revival of Jiashan Pottery Industry</h3>
<p>— Tu Huizi</p>
<p>Jiashan pottery industry occupies a considerable position in the country, as recorded in local gazetteers. In the northern, northwestern, and northeastern regions of the county, chimneys stand like forests, and there are over eight hundred kiln mounds. Farmers rely entirely on this as their primary occupation. There are more than 460 pottery households, over 110,000 shaping households, over 220 mud-brick households, and over 14,000 others engaged in tasks such as transporting mud-bricks, loading kilns, and transporting goods. This truly affects the livelihoods of the entire county's 210,000 residents. Production includes bricks, tiles, and roofing slates, mostly made by hand. There are only four mechanized factories: Taishan, Huaxin, Taoxin, and Jinmen, with Taishan being the largest, having a branch in Longhua and the most distribution outlets. The main sales market is Shanghai, with the rest distributed throughout the Yangtze River basin, with an annual output of over 110,000 tiles and bricks, valued at 5.89 million. Since the economic downturn affected construction, the pottery industry was no exception. With sluggish sales, finances stagnated, and prices gradually fell. Pottery households reduced expenses by laying off workers and cutting wages, leading to frequent labor strikes. Goods deliveries and transportation came to a standstill, and competitors became jealous of each other, resorting to inferior materials and cutting corners to sell at lower prices. As the quality of goods deteriorated, reputation was lost. Potteries from other provinces seized the opportunity to capture the county's original market, causing the county's pottery industry to decline. When County Magistrate Yu Shuluan visited the county, accompanied by a representative from the Civil Affairs Department's Baojia (self-governance) Guidance Office, he recognized the pottery industry as the county's main production, indirectly related to the province's economy, and intended to revive it. After taking charge of county affairs, he convened pottery merchants from the entire county for detailed discussions and invited pottery experts to the county for on-site inspections to formulate a plan. This was submitted to the provincial authorities and approved at the 856th provincial administrative meeting. The county magistrate then went to Shanghai several times to discuss loans with bankers. With funding secured, a Pottery Industry Management Office was established, with the county magistrate serving as the director. Several engineering consultants were hired, and operations began on November 1st. The county was divided into seven kiln districts, each with an office and a resident manager. The Construction Department also dispatched pottery expert Hu Juewen to the county as a pottery industry instructor, stationed in the county to supervise the work. A Pottery Industry Research Association was also organized, with prominent figures from the party and government serving as committee members. Furthermore, a Pottery Industry Training Course was opened at the county government on December 8th, with all pottery merchants and staff attending. The main points of the revival are as follows: (1) Improving Quality: The county's pottery products are sold to a limited extent inland, with Shanghai being the largest market. In recent years, construction has predominantly used cement, steel, or new-style bricks and tiles. The county's pottery products still adhere to traditional methods and lack improvement, making it difficult to compete in the market. Moreover, the quality of goods varies, and the sizes are inconsistent, failing to meet the needs of engineers. At the same time, large quantities of goods cannot be produced to match the overall materials. Therefore, improvements are urgently needed. The methods include: (2) Technical Improvement: There are specific standards for the mixing and density of raw and cooked mud and the weathering time of new mud, striving to avoid looseness, roughness, or irregular edges in quality. Inspectors are regularly dispatched to the site for verification. The strength of the fire and the amount of water are recorded by supervisors at the kiln, and reward and punishment regulations are established. In addition, methods are devised to improve kiln construction and loading techniques, and demonstration kilns are designated as models for general guidance. (2) Inspection of Products: Brick and tile molds are made by mold merchants and sold to the shaping households. Now, mold merchants are registered and issued permits before being allowed to operate. Molds must have a specific design and be made of durable wood, with engraved trademarks. The management office will verify and stamp them. Shaping households are not allowed to freely modify newly purchased molds. New molds are re-inspected after production, and qualified ones are stamped for sale. All these matters are subject to inspection by inspectors at any time. (2) Controlling Production: All kiln mounds in the county are numbered, and the monthly output is checked. The management office will distribute and promote sales based on the consumption in various ports. The firing and stopping of kilns are also regulated, so that goods are not overstocked and meet the needs of the market. (3) Unified Transportation and Sales: Pottery households have traditionally sold their goods in small quantities and individually, often facing cutthroat competition. Now, each kiln district will organize a cooperative, with pottery households as production and sales members, and shaping households as manufacturing members. There are also basic cooperatives, divided into three types: mud-brick making, sales, and material purchasing. Supervisors are assigned to provide guidance at all times. The seven cooperatives will form a united association, which will handle transportation and sales. Sales offices will be set up in Shanghai and Hangzhou, with sales directors stationed there to report on market conditions and promote production. Secondly, cargo ships will be registered, and the sales system will be changed to a freight system. All kiln prices and freight rates will be set by the office and cannot be changed without authorization. In the future, water transport will be expanded to land transport, not only eliminating the profiteering and monopoly of brokers but also streamlining transaction procedures and eliminating the hassle of solicitation. This is a general overview of the pottery industry revival plan.</p>

The above three items should first be telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance by the various chambers of commerce in a joint name for amendment; (4) The following items listed in Article 12 of the Collection Guidelines should be revised: (A) Capital interest should exclude official interest; (B) Free donations should exclude those for public welfare and charitable purposes (such as donations for purchasing machinery, celebrating birthdays, etc.); (C) The phrase "or reforming equipment" should be deleted from the expenses for business expansion or equipment reform; (D) The phrase "or effectiveness" should be deleted from the repair costs for houses, factories, warehouses, machinery, tools, appliances, and ships that are sufficient to increase their original value or effectiveness. The above decisions should be submitted to the general meeting for approval before implementation.</p>
<p>Research Meeting</p>
<p>The research meeting continued at 2:00 PM, with 162 representatives attending. Gu Suming presided over the meeting, and Ye Zhizhong served as the recorder. The chairman first reported on the results of the group meeting, which were approved and accepted. Subsequently, the following motions were discussed: (1) Wujin Chamber of Commerce proposed that for dividends and profits from January 1 to February 10, 1937, those who settle accounts according to the lunar calendar should be given clear regulations. Resolution: Merged into a related case for request; (2) According to Article 13 of the Collection Guidelines, the income tax already paid from business income should be deducted from the income tax payable. For example, if a certain company paid a tax of 30 yuan on a surplus of over 1,000 yuan in a certain exchange, can this 30 yuan be deducted from the income tax payable after the company settles its accounts? Resolution: According to the interpretation of Article 12 of the Implementation Rules, individual temporary business income can be deducted by exchange brokers, but not by shop numbers; (3) If the company's articles of association do not stipulate dividends, but distribute bonuses from the surplus, will this not be regarded as interest on stocks in the second category of Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations? Resolution: Dividends are taxed, bonuses are not taxed. The Collection Guidelines for the third category have regulations; (4) The Hardware Guild proposed whether income tax should be listed as public expenses. Resolution: Income tax cannot be included in public expenses because taxes can only be calculated after pure profit is determined; (5) In addition to actual losses during the business period, bad debts should include reasonable forecasts of bad debt losses for accounts receivable at the time of settlement. Resolution: Principle approved, submitted to the group meeting for research; (6) The Sauce Garden Industry proposed whether the income from a business's real estate can be tax-exempt. Resolution: Whether a store has real estate income related to its main business or auxiliary business, it must be included in the total income for taxation; (7) The Silk and Satin Industry proposed that if a store has deposits in banks and money shops, and the interest has already been subject to income tax, should it be taxed again after being added to the store's total income? Is this duplication? Resolution: The Collection Guidelines have stipulated that refunds can be issued for those who have been taxed twice; (8) The Great China Match Company proposed whether the amortization of goodwill (purchased with cash) is not clearly stipulated in Article 15 of the Implementation Rules and Article 10 of the Collection Guidelines for the first category, can it be included in the profit and loss statement as an expense? Resolution: Goodwill is the right to operate a business, and Article 13 of the Valuation Method in the Collection Guidelines for the first category already has regulations; (9) If a legal entity whose purpose is not to profit from real estate invests in real estate and obtains income, should that income be excluded when calculating pure profit? Resolution: Submitted to the group meeting for research; (10) Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce proposed that the current accounts of stores are different from fixed deposits because they have both deposits and debts. Should interest income tax be exempted? Resolution: Submitted to the group meeting; (11) Submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to formulate regulations for the organization of the review committee as soon as possible so that it can be established as soon as possible. Resolution: The original proposal was adopted; (12) The Silk and Satin Guild proposed that stores should still retain the cash accounting system. Resolution: Submitted to the group meeting; (13) Chen Ziyi, representative of the bean and rice industry, proposed that the silver and money industry should receive a one-fifth bonus for withholding income tax, and all industries should request the same precedent and handle it uniformly. Resolution: Passed. After the discussion of the above first category of business income was completed, the discussion of the second category of salary and remuneration income continued. First, accountant Xu Yongzuo reported, summarizing the submitted proposals into six points: (1) Salaries starting from 30 yuan are subject to tax, which is too low. It should be changed to starting from 50 yuan; (2) The second category tax rate is too progressive, there are too few brackets, and the difference between each bracket is too large; (3) There are too few tax exemptions. The following should be added: (A) Tax exemption for family burden; (B) Tax exemption for all mandatory savings other than statutory savings; (C) Tax exemption for life insurance; (D) Tax exemption for pensions and alimony in addition to education savings; (4) Fixed allowances for food and lodging expenses, transportation expenses, and entertainment expenses should not be regarded as salary and remuneration and should not be taxed; (5) Commissions, handling fees, and remuneration that are taxed repeatedly should be refunded or not taxed; (6) Copyright royalties should be tax-exempt. After the report, the chairman announced that the second group meeting would be held tomorrow (the 23rd) at 10:00 AM, and the general meeting would be held at 2:00 PM. At 5:00 PM, the Income Tax Affairs Office will host a tea party for all representatives on the seventh floor of the New Asia Hotel. All representatives are requested to attend.</p>
<h3>Two Income Tax Suggestions</h3>
<p>Please Extend the Capital Declaration Period; Please Do Not Limit Reserve Funds</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "Dear Sir, According to the announcement of your office, all income from items A and B of the first category should be reported and taxed by the persons in charge of the respective businesses after the end of this business year, starting from January of this year. According to the merchants of various industries, the Ministry of Finance's Geng telegram in response to our chamber on January 8 stated, 'We have received the Yan telegram of December. For income from business operations in items A and B whose settlement period is February 10, 1937, the income from January 1 to February 10, 1937, will be allowed to be reported and taxed at the same time after the next settlement. After that, the settlement will be made once a year according to the customary period of each industry.' Therefore, the end of each industry's customary period is recognized by the Ministry of Finance, and the fact that this year's settlement period is February 10 is also known to the Ministry of Finance. The amount of income should be reported after the annual settlement period, which is clearly stated in Article 8 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and in your office's announcement. However, item 3 of the announcement also states that the names of the persons in charge and the actual amount of business capital or share capital should be filled in and sent to the office for registration before the end of January of this year. Before the final conclusion, whether the business will continue, and whether the capital or share capital will increase or decrease, are still uncertain. Therefore, it is practically difficult to fill in the form and report before the end of January. If the business changes, this procedure will be futile and will have to be reported separately. We propose that your office consider making changes and allow the form to be filled in and reported within one month after the final conclusion on February 10, so that the handling will be more based on facts and the business situation will be more convenient. Moreover, since the Ministry has ordered that the tax payment for this year be extended to the next payment, making changes to the period stipulated in Article 46 of the Detailed Rules will not hinder the reporting procedures. We hope that you will investigate and reply. This is the most important thing." Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, He Xianggu, and Kong Rulin, representatives of the bean and rice industry and the miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry, submitted a motion to the Income Tax Research Association of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating the following reasons: "For thousands of years, the commercial customs of our country, regardless of partnerships or sole proprietorships, have always set aside reserve funds from the annual business profits. The reservation of this reserve fund is the same in nature and different in name as the public reserve fund stipulated in the Company Law. The purpose of setting aside is, on the negative side, to prepare for making up for future losses or to meet the needs of special events that occur temporarily, and on the positive side, to enrich the strength of the business so that its business foundation reaches a stable and long-term position. In practice, it participates in business activities with the same function as the original invested funds. Item 2 of Article 7 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations states, 'If there is a public reserve fund, one-third of the total amount may be included in the calculation of capital.' Also, Item 11 of the Draft Collection Guidelines for Income Tax for the First Category of Business Operations states, 'If the public reserve fund has reached one-half of the total capital, the public reserve fund set aside may not be used as a statutory public reserve fund.' This is enough to gradually reduce the strength of business operations and affect the shaking of the entire commercial foundation. To seek profits and avoid losses is human nature. If setting aside a public reserve fund is subject to strict restrictions and limitations in tax law, then those that were set aside in the past will be distributed before the income tax is levied. In the future, even if there are losses that need to be made up, we would rather add capital than set aside reserves to bear the current tax burden. Based on the above reasons, our association believes that at the beginning of the government's creation of income tax, it should give some consideration to the development of commercial self-reliance, quickly allow the public reserve funds of business operations to be included in capital, and cancel the restriction that public reserve funds that have reached one-half of the capital may not be used as statutory public reserve funds. We sincerely hope that this is appropriate. The proposers: Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry, Bean and Rice Industry Guild."</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Return Withholding Income Tax Bonuses to Depositors</h3>
<p>With the approval of the Ministry of Finance, the Silver and Money Industry Guild has followed through with the bonus policy for withholding income tax. A reporter from New Voice Agency withdrew money from a certain bank yesterday, and according to regulations, the income tax on deposit interest should have been withheld at a rate of 50 per mille. However, the bank actually withheld 40 per mille. According to the bank clerk, the income tax on deposit interest should be 50 per mille according to regulations, but the banks and money shops are now returning the withholding bonus given by the Ministry of Finance to the depositors. This is an extra consideration. The deposit income tax withheld by the bank or money shop is still calculated as 50 per mille.</p>
<h3>Soliciting Opinions on First Category Income Tax</h3>
<p>Accountant Pan Xulun and others send a letter to the Income Tax Affairs Office, stating their opinions on revising the Draft Collection Guidelines for First Category Income Tax. "After reviewing the Draft Collection Guidelines for Income Tax, the Income Tax Affairs Office has published them separately to solicit opinions from all sectors. Yesterday, accountants Pan Xulun, Li Wenjie, Qian Naiheng, Li Hongshou, Chen Wenlin, and Tang Wenrui of the Lixin Accounting Firm in this city sent a letter to the Income Tax Affairs Office, stating their opinions on revising the Draft Collection Guidelines for Income Tax for the First Category of Business Operations based on the results of their research. The original letter is very long. The main points are excerpted below for reference and research by those in the industrial and commercial sectors who are concerned about income tax." (1) Article 5 of the Draft Collection Guidelines for the First Category (hereinafter referred to as "the Draft") stipulates that "the public reserve fund mentioned in Item 2 of Article 7 of the Detailed Rules for Implementation is limited to the public reserve fund stipulated by laws and regulations." After reviewing the rules and regulations, the item does not contain the meaning of this restriction, and the Collection Guidelines forcibly restrict it, which deprives the rights that have already been granted to business operators in the Detailed Rules for Implementation. It should be revised. (2) According to the provisions of Articles 9 and 10 of the Draft, the accounting systems of all business operations must adopt the accrual basis (i.e., the accrual basis) and not the cash basis. There may be many obstacles in implementation. In the United States, the accrual basis and the cash basis can be used together. With the immaturity and incompleteness of the level of industrial and commercial accounting in our country, it is difficult to require taxpayers to adopt a complete accrual basis uniformly. It is better to follow the precedent of the United States and allow taxpayers to choose any system. (3) Article 12 of the Draft stipulates that "free donations" cannot be regarded as necessary business expenses. In this case, all gifts, airplane donations, assistance to Sui donations, flood and drought donations, etc., given by various industrial and commercial organizations for entertainment and communication will not be able to be listed as expenses and will have to be taxed, which is too harsh. In fact, these donations are necessary expenditures for industrial and commercial operators to maintain their business reputation. Because they are related to business, they should be regarded as expenses. As for donations that have nothing to do with business, they can be disallowed as expenses. (4) Article 16 of the Draft stipulates, "If the remaining property of business operations in Items A and B of the Draft exceeds the actual amount of original capital after economic calculations due to mergers and dissolutions, the excess portion shall be taxed at the tax rate in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations." In this case, the public reserve fund, reserve fund, and retained earnings that have been set aside shall already be taxed for Items A and B of the first category during previous settlements. When they are liquidated and distributed, they shall be taxed again for Item C of the first category, which is undoubtedly duplication. Article 21 of the Detailed Rules for Implementation stipulates, "If business operations still have income after settlement due to mergers, dissolutions, and liquidations, they shall also be taxed." The income mentioned in this article should refer to the income during the liquidation period and should never refer to the voluntary public reserves that have been set aside and taxed before the liquidation period. Therefore, Article 16 of the Draft must be revised. (5) Article 23 of the Draft stipulates that taxpayers should present "the necessary account books of the current business year or the previous year, or a clear inventory of assets and liabilities, or other documents that can prove it" when being investigated. Observing that the word "or" is used several times in the article, it seems that if the taxpayer has presented any one of the listed documents, he does not need to present other documents again. This seems to be avoiding the opening of the door of convenience for investigators, which is inappropriate. All the words "or" should be changed to "or and" (i.e., "and/or" in English), and the clear inventory that belongs to the nature of profit and loss should also be ordered to be presented sometimes. (6) The asset valuation method attached to the Draft is too simple and rigid and should be supplemented and revised as follows: A. Article 13 of the valuation method stipulates that the amortization period for business rights and copyrights is 10 years, which sometimes cannot be consistent with the facts. It should be changed to a more flexible provision. B. The shortest useful life of each asset stipulated in the depreciation rate calculation table cannot be used as the shortest depreciation period in fact. The occurrence of depreciation is not only due to the durability of the material but also needs to take into account the two levels of "inapplicability" and "abandonment." For example, the table stipulates that the shortest useful life of steel-concrete or brick-built offices and buildings is 60 years. In Shanghai, it is rare for office buildings to be used for as long as 60 years. Therefore, the depreciation rate set by the table must be re-ordered according to the facts with more flexible provisions. C. Article 19 of the valuation method only recognizes the method of estimating bad debts individually and does not recognize the method of comprehensive preparation estimation. This causes significant difficulties for industrial and commercial operators with a large number of accounts in estimating bad debts and is incomplete. VII. There is also an important modification in the wording, that is, Article 7 of the Draft says, "Convert its capital amount in proportion to the entire year during the business period." The wording is really lacking in fluency. It should be changed to "Multiply the pure profit amount by a multiple of the length of time equivalent to the business period for the whole year" before it is fluent. Because the pure profit amount can be converted by the length of time, the capital amount only has a monthly and daily average and cannot be converted into other amounts by the length of time.</p>
<h3>Liang Hejun to Host All Sectors Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce convened an income tax research association, which held three meetings and studied problems in two aspects: legal and factual. In addition to the legal points, which were mostly answered by accountant Xu Yongzuo one by one, the factual points that could not be resolved were generally reserved and summarized for the competent income tax authority to review and instruct. Liang Hejun and others from the Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Income Tax Offices are scheduled to hold a tea party at 5:00 PM today on the seventh floor of the New Asia Hotel to host representatives from the research association, as well as the Party Headquarters, the Chamber of Commerce, the press, accountants, etc., to provide guidance. It is reported that the number of participants is about two hundred and dozens of people, and there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Yan Huijing Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Plans to Visit Hangzhou; Returning North in Two Weeks</p>
<p>Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Dr. Yan Huijing arrived in Shanghai at 7:40 AM yesterday on the Shanghai-Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) train from Tianjin and stayed at the International Hotel. According to those around him, Dr. Yan has been resting and recuperating due to stomach illness since resigning and returning to China, and has declined all parties' invitations. This visit is to reciprocate the visits of friends and plans to visit Hangzhou within the month, returning north in about two weeks.</p>
<h3>Female Dancers, Musicians, and Actresses: All Subject to Income Tax Withholding</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Greater Shanghai Entertainment Co., Ltd. previously sent a letter to the Shanghai Income Tax Office for clarification regarding the method of withholding income tax for female dancers, accompanying dancers, musicians, and actresses. A response has been received stating that the income of all the aforementioned professionals is derived from direct labor. Therefore, regardless of whether they are employed by dance halls or are self-employed, and regardless of whether they receive salaries or split earnings by agreement, the organization receiving their income shall withhold income tax from the total amount of their monthly income, based on the salary income of other workers, at the time of distribution or payment. The Shanghai Office has notified all entertainment venues to implement this uniformly.</p>

<h3>The French Concession's Pharmacy Strike Trend Suddenly Eases Last Night</h3>
<p>A Solution is Likely. The French Municipal Council Will First Restore Electricity and Fire This Morning. The Pharmaceutical Association Will Then Notify All Businesses to Resume Operations. The Tax Issue Has Been Resolved with Two Methods.</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports: The strike of Chinese medicine stores in the French Concession is easing after authorities negotiated with the French Municipal Council and persuaded the pharmaceutical industry. Last night, the situation suddenly became more moderate, with the possibility of an immediate resolution. New Voice News Agency reporters have learned that the French Municipal Council will first restore electricity and fire to all pharmacies today, and then the Pharmaceutical Association will notify all pharmacies to resume operations. Regarding the restoration of electricity and fire, a handling fee of seven yuan should be paid according to regulations, but the French side has also agreed to waive it. Regarding the payment of the pharmaceutical tax, in order to safeguard the budget of the French Municipal Council for the 25th year, it is permitted to pay half of the original amount. As for the 26th year, the French Municipal Council will submit a request to the board of directors for further reconsideration.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation Remained Serious. Yesterday, the situation of the Chinese medicine store strike in the French Concession remained serious. According to a New Voice News Agency reporter's investigation, although the detained clerk of Gaodetang has been released, the barbed wire fences in front of Mitianyi, Laotongren, Xiuxin, Rongren, and other stores have not yet been removed. The detectives stationed at each pharmacy have also not been withdrawn. Those whose electricity was cut off yesterday included Xu Chongdao on Avenue Joffre, Kangyutang on Rue Amiral Bayle, and Ye Shudetang on Avenue de l'Amiral Petit Thouars. As of yesterday, almost all had their electricity cut off. The French Municipal Council sent personnel to warn each pharmacy, stating that if the donations were not paid within three days, a complete blockade would be implemented and water would continue to be cut off.</p>
<p>Striking Colleagues Firmly Insist. The Pharmaceutical Association held a plenary meeting of executives and supervisors at 2:00 PM yesterday and decided to convene an emergency meeting of representatives from all colleagues in the French Concession to discuss all response measures. The meeting was held at 9:00 PM that evening. More than 100 representatives from colleagues in the French Concession attended, and all executives and supervisors of the Association also participated. During the meeting, representatives exchanged views and unanimously advocated adhering to the Association's resolution, persevering to the end, and not stopping until the goal of abolishing the exorbitant taxes was achieved.</p>
<p>The Association Decides on Negotiation Channels. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned that in order to alleviate the suffering of colleagues as soon as possible, the Pharmaceutical Association will follow the following channels to resolve the strike. In addition to requesting party and government authorities to continue negotiations, the French Municipal Council's imposition of exorbitant taxes and implementation of power outages were illegal. It was decided to proceed with legal procedures. It is also heard that the Association has sent personnel to consult with lawyers from Da Shang to proceed. In addition, appeals will be made to all sectors of society to help promote an early resolution.</p>
<p>Various Industries Support and Insist on Three Points. Various colleagues in the salted fish industry, aquatic wood industry, and fresh pork industry are deeply indignant because the French Municipal Council not only showed no intention of abolishing the exorbitant taxes but also continued to exert pressure. They intend to submit another request to the authorities to negotiate a resolution as soon as possible, insisting on three requirements: (1) Immediately restore electricity and fire unconditionally; (2) Guarantee the right to demand compensation for losses due to the strike; (3) Guarantee that the same situation will not happen again in the entire district in the future. If the goal is not achieved, they are prepared to take the most effective assistance measures.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Negotiates with the French Authorities. Central News Agency reports: Yesterday at noon, Cen Zhiliang and Huang Huichang, representatives of the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, went to the Municipal Government, where Secretary Geng personally received them and inquired about the events of the strike. The two representatives reported the details and requested a speedy resolution to maintain the market. Secretary Geng conducted preliminary verbal negotiations with the French Concession Police yesterday afternoon, believing that cutting off water and electricity would harm public order. Therefore, the Municipal Government intends to restore water and electricity first, and the Chinese pharmacies will also resume business first, and then negotiate the regulations and donations for Chinese medicine preparations. If the French Concession authorities can accept the Municipal Government's views, the situation may ease, it is said.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of the Second Special District Federation. The National News Agency reports: After the French Municipal Council forced the collection of pharmaceutical retail tax from Chinese medicine stores in the French Concession, a strike was triggered. The Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation convened a temporary emergency meeting at the Federation's location at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than 20 people attended, including Shang Mujiang, Qu Zhenhua, Gong Jingyan, Huang Xianggu, Wang Deyan, Zheng Xia, Shao Ziying, Ji Weiliang, Qian Jia Kui, Zhang Gengshan, Shao Baoxing, He Guangming, Mao Yun, Zhang Shishi, Xu Xiuting, Bei Zairong, Zhou Qinpu, Zhu Shengmao, Zhu Wenqi, Wang Haifan, Dong Kechang, and Jin Liren. Wang Deyan was elected chairman. The chairman first reported on the resolutions of the previous meeting and the strike situation of the National Pharmaceutical Industry. Discussions then began, and the following important matters were resolved: (1) This Federation has repeatedly received letters from various businesses reporting that the French Municipal Council has cut off water and electricity and forced the collection of pharmaceutical retail tax from the National Pharmaceutical Industry. Such unreasonable actions and oppression are unbearable for businessmen. It is requested that your Federation uphold justice, seek liberation and fight for the dignity of Chinese taxpayers in the entire district, and conduct serious negotiations as soon as possible to abolish the new tax and immediately restore electricity and fire. In the event that this cannot be achieved, all businesses in the district are willing to provide strong assistance and will not hesitate to make any sacrifices, etc. How should this case be handled? It was resolved that: (1) Qu Zhenhua and Gong Jingyan will be elected as representatives to negotiate with Director Wei of the Municipal Council in person. (2) A telegram will be sent to the French Ambassador Nachia to correct the Municipal Council's illegal disconnection of electricity in order to avoid accidents. (3) A letter will be sent to the French Concession Taxpayers' Association to forward to the Chinese directors that the new tax rate for the National Pharmaceutical Industry should be submitted to the Municipal Council meeting for reconsideration and cancellation. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the French Ambassador Requesting Correction. The Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation decided to send a telegram to the French Ambassador for correction at a temporary emergency meeting yesterday. The telegram reads as follows: "To His Excellency Ambassador Nachia, The French Municipal Council of the Shanghai French Concession has cut off water and electricity because Chinese pharmacies cannot afford the new tax rate, causing a pharmacy strike. It has been three days and there is still no resolution. Cutting off water and electricity cuts off the lives of citizens, and the Municipal Council often uses this method to deal with citizens. Other shops are also very angry. If the Municipal Council does not restore water and electricity, it will cause resentment among all residents of the French Concession. Considering that Your Excellency has always cared for the citizens of the French Concession, we implore you to correct the Municipal Council's harsh behavior to avoid unexpected changes. Yours sincerely, Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation."</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Sent Telegrams Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting that Zhang Xueliang be Sent to Court</p>
<p>After listing Zhang Xueliang's eleven major crimes of harming the country and the people, the Joint Conference of Various Organizations in this city submitted them to the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Justice yesterday, requesting that they be dealt with according to the law, and telegraphed the whole country to unanimously advocate for this. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Submission to the Military Affairs Commission</p>
<p>The Joint Conference of Various Organizations in Shanghai submitted a document to the Military Affairs Commission, stating: "Submission for the sake of submission. Zhang Xueliang, a traitor, has committed notorious crimes against the country and the people. The public groups in this city are heartbroken by Zhang's betrayal and held a joint conference on [Date] to list Zhang Xueliang's eleven major crimes (attached). It was resolved to submit a request to the Military Affairs Commission to transfer Zhang Xueliang to the court for trial. It is noted that Zhang's rebellious mutiny in Xi'an, his acts of insurrection, his collusion with the Communist bandits, and his destruction of unity have previously led to the establishment of a special military court by your esteemed commission, which sentenced him to ten years of imprisonment. Although the National Government issued a special pardon, Zhang's rebellious nature has caused irreparable damage to the country's vitality. If he is not severely punished, how can the law be upheld and the foundation of the country be maintained? It is therefore reasonable to submit a request to your esteemed commission to transfer Zhang Xueliang to the court immediately for trial and to impose the appropriate punishment. We are overwhelmed with sincere prayer."</p>
<p>Submission to the Ministry of Justice</p>
<p>The Joint Conference of Various Organizations in Shanghai submitted a document to the Ministry of Justice, stating: "Submission for the sake of submission. Zhang Xueliang lost four provinces, humiliated the nation, kidnapped the commander-in-chief, and committed acts of insurrection. His crimes are too numerous to count. The public groups in this city are heartbroken by Zhang's betrayal and held a joint conference on [Date] to list Zhang Xueliang's eleven major crimes (attached). It was resolved to submit a request to the Ministry of Justice to order the Supreme Court to promptly investigate. In addition to submitting a request to the Military Affairs Commission to transfer Zhang to the court for trial, it is reasonable to submit a request to your esteemed ministry to instruct the Supreme Court to promptly investigate and punish him according to law in order to uphold the law. We are overwhelmed with sincere prayer."</p>
<p>Telegram to the Whole Country</p>
<p>"To all national agencies, organizations, and newspapers, The Joint Conference of Various Organizations has submitted documents to the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Justice (see above). Please unanimously advocate to punish traitors and uphold the law. We hereby inform you and hope for your consideration. Sincerely, Joint Conference of Various Organizations in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng each boarded a private train carriage last night attached to the overnight express train to leave Beijing and arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Students in Military Training Telegraph Request to Punish Yang</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: All military training students and trained citizens in this city telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, requesting the suppression of Yang Hucheng, etc., stating: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Military Affairs Commission, The Xi'an Incident has aroused nationwide indignation, while the principal offender Zhang Xueliang has received the grace of special pardon, and the accomplices Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong have also received the leniency of being dismissed but retained in their positions. The Central Government's painstaking efforts to preserve national strength and protect soldiers are recognized by the people of the whole country. If Yang, Yu, and others have any conscience, how should they express gratitude and repay their kindness, make amends for their crimes, obey orders, and handle the aftermath? However, news has come that Yang, Yu, and others are prone to creating chaos and show no repentance. They have resisted orders in the past and are now resorting to arms and rebellion. Recently, they have even dared to commit heinous acts, colluding with the Communist bandits, spreading fallacies, and endangering the party and the country. There is nothing worse than this. If such traitors are tolerated again, not only will the unified situation of recent years be on the verge of collapse, but also the great achievements of past bandit suppression will be wasted in a month, and the fate of the country and the nation will be unimaginable. Therefore, we telegraph and request your esteemed departments (government) (commission) to accept public opinion and promptly order suppression in order to quell the source of trouble and restore discipline. Our entire body of 25,000 comrades is willing to serve as a backing and listen to orders. We are overwhelmed with urgent anticipation of your orders. Sincerely, All Military Training Students and Trained Citizens in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Ninguo County, Southern Anhui Province, Suffers from Banditry; Garrison Troops are Responsible for Suppression</h3>
<p>Zhang Fakui and Others Telegraph a Response to Yang Hu</p>
<p>After Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, received a telegram from the Ninguo County Chamber of Commerce in southern Anhui Province reporting bandit activity, he immediately telegraphed Liu Zhenhua, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, and Zhang Fakui, former Director of the Fujian-Zhejiang-Anhui-Jiangxi Border Area and current Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Border Area, requesting that they send troops to assist in the suppression to clear the banditry. He has now received telegrams from Liu and Zhang responding to Commander Yang that the bandits in Ninguo and other counties in southern Anhui Province have been assigned to the newly appointed Director of the Fujian-Zhejiang-Anhui-Jiangxi Border Area, Liu Jianxu, who has dispatched troops to be responsible for suppression. The original text of the two telegrams is recorded below: (1) Liu Zhenhua's telegram states: "To Commander Yang Xiaotian of the Shanghai Songhu Garrison Headquarters, I have received your confidential telegram. It has been verified that the bandits in Ninguo and other counties in southern Anhui Province have been assigned by the Military Affairs Commission to be suppressed by the Fujian-Zhejiang-Anhui-Jiangxi Border Area Director's Office. Director Liu (Jianxu) has now assigned a certain division to be responsible for suppression, with a deadline of before the geng day of the second month to eliminate them. The division has already arrived at a certain line, and this government has also instructed the security teams stationed in southern Anhui Province to listen to the command of a certain division commander and cooperate in the suppression to ensure that they are eliminated as scheduled. Regarding the matters you mentioned, in addition to supervising the subordinates to assist in the suppression at any time, I am responding accordingly for your inspection and hope that you will inform the Chamber of Commerce, etc. Brother Liu Zhenhua, [Seal]." (2) Zhang Fakui's telegram states: "To Commander Yang Xiaotian of Shanghai, Confidential. I have received the text from Commander Liu (Jianxu) stating that the bandits in Ninguo have been ordered to be suppressed by troops dispatched by Commander Gu. Before they arrive, Commander Li Songshan will also be instructed to take care of them. This is specially conveyed. Please relieve your mind. Brother Zhang Fakui, [Seal]."</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson Comprador Dispute Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Seamen's Union mediated and decided on three methods.</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson Company's compradors previously organized a association, arousing opposition from the "xizai" (Chinese clerks) and causing a dispute. Yesterday, Yang, a special representative of the Seamen's Union, sent Wang Jiyi and Wang Yalen to convene Li Zaichen, a representative of the compradors, and Wang Shanqing, a representative of the Tongyi Society, for fair mediation. Three methods were decided, which both parties considered satisfactory, and a resolution has been announced. The methods are recorded below: (1) Regarding the distribution of wine money received, the compradors will receive one share and the trainees will receive half a share. (2) If the compradors are transferred to different ships, the new compradors will receive the original compradors' supplies, food, etc., which will be estimated at market prices. (3) Unemployed workers from both sides must complete registration with the Seamen's Union within one month. Afterwards, the Seamen's Union will assign jobs to the unemployed in order of priority. The Tongyi Society shall not recommend. If the "xizai" are not working diligently, they must be suspended from work, and the compradors must first report to the Seamen's Union for approval.</p>
<h3>Crew of the New Peking Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>According to reports, the ship is still stranded, but the goods were not damaged.</p>
<p>The New Peking, a ship of the British-owned Taikoo Steam Navigation Company operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, ran aground outside the Zhenhai port at 5:00 AM the day before yesterday. All 500 passengers and more than 2,000 pieces of cargo were rescued. The Shanghai company has hired the Sand No. 4 tugboat of the Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. to the site of the accident for further rescue. At the site of the accident, the British warship Dantai happened to be passing by and berthed nearby to provide protection. The bottom of the ship's forward cabin has been breached by the reef and is still stranded there. If there are no major storms, it should not sink. It is also heard that work has begun to plug the hole, and after the tide rises, they will try to tow it to Shanghai for repairs in the dock. Because the company has no way to send a ship to replace it temporarily, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has been temporarily suspended. More than 200 employees in various departments of the ship, including the firemen, sailors, compradors, cargo clerks, middle cabin, and engine drivers, were rescued to Ningbo by ships such as the Tai'an warship and the anti-smuggling warship. A portion of the crew, 30 people, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the Ningshao. A New Voice News Agency reporter spoke with Chu Shengrong, a worker in the middle cabin department who arrived in Shanghai yesterday. He said that the ship left Shanghai for Ningbo on Wednesday (the 20th) and encountered danger at Laotaipo Reef at 4:20 AM on Thursday (the 21st). At 4:30 AM, a telegram was sent to all parties requesting rescue. The head cabin flooded to 11 feet 6 inches, then to 10 inches. The Ningbo company sent the Tai'an warship, the Zhejiang Provincial Foreign Sea Anti-Smuggling Warship No. 25, the Customs patrol boat, and the Jian'an and other tugboats to rescue the passengers to the Liyi, Donghai, Ningxiang, Zhenbei, Ningyu Zhen, and other five ships, and arrived in Ningbo at 2:00 PM. The second and third cabins did not flood, and the goods were not damaged at that time. Wheelock Marden sent two tugboats and a British warship to protect and rescue, etc. Yang Hu, a special representative of the Seamen's Union, sent Secretary Wang Jiyi and Section Chief Wang Yalen, as well as Lu Rongzhi, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch, and Peng Bowei also sent Lu Shuangxi, Mao Yu Feng, and Cheng Yongming, to express their condolences to the workers who came to Shanghai. The Seamen's Union decided to provide relief because the workers were rescuing passengers, and their personal belongings were not taken.</p>
<h3>Details of Another Large Dredger for the Dredging Bureau</h3>
<p>German Xue Shang Company wins the bid. The cost is approximately 3.7 million. The construction period is two years to complete and sail to Shanghai.</p>

The construction cost is 231,700 pounds (approximately 3.7 million national currency). The construction period is two years (calculated from the date of the contract until the ship is sailed to Shanghai for delivery). Regarding nearby contact matters, the company entrusted the Shanghai Siemens Foreign Firm to act as its agent. A reporter from the Datong News Agency learned at the bureau yesterday morning that the ship is 400 feet long and 62 and a half feet wide. It can dig up approximately 2,500 cubic yards of mud per hour. After the ship is completed and arrives in Shanghai, it will be added to the dredging work at the Wusongkou Shishentan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Experiments with Improving Child Laborers' Diets</h3>
<p>The Factories Affairs Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council is currently cooperating with the Lester Institute of Medical Research to study the health problems of workers. The results obtained are very beneficial in preventing workers from getting sick. The office noted that many workers get sick due to insufficient nutrition, such as male child laborers often suffering from beriberi, which is especially severe in the summer. The reason is related to food, so it was decided to start improving the diet of child laborers to improve their nutrition. The first step of the experiment is to rent a city house in the factory area to establish a small canteen for child laborers. However, only about 50 people can be accommodated at the beginning of the establishment to simplify the equipment. The canteen will cost approximately 9,000 yuan per year, of which 2,520 yuan will be paid by the factory owners, 3,480 yuan will be donated by the Lester Institute of Medical Research, and the remaining 3,000 yuan will be borne by the Municipal Council. The bureau has approved the inclusion of this amount in the 1937 budget.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul Suma Discusses the Guangdong Spirit of China</h3>
<p>The Japanese Shanghai Daily reports: Consul Suma of Nanjing arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and is scheduled to return to his country on the Taiyo Maru today, the 23rd. He made the following remarks to Japanese reporters at the embassy: "I have been in China for eleven years. During this time, China's situation has changed dramatically, like a surging wave. What I feel most deeply is that the 'Guangdong spirit' is the center of the National Government and has spread throughout China. The characteristics of the Guangdong spirit are an indomitable soul and the recovery of national rights. Many important figures in the National Government are from Guangdong. Although Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei are not from Guangdong, they have also received training in the Guangdong spirit. This spirit has been deeply expanded year by year in the past eleven years, so the indomitable soul will gradually strengthen in the future. The recovery of national rights, that is, the so-called recovery of lost territories by force, cannot be carried out rapidly, but its speed will vary from time to time. This is what we should pay attention to regarding the future trends of China and recognize its true nature. From another perspective, China is a large market in the world. However, this market is now open to foreign countries except Japan. How should Japan develop this market? This is the most important awareness for Japan's policy towards China. I believe that Japan should not take a passive observation of China, but should actively understand and adopt appropriate policies to improve Sino-Japanese relations."</p>

<h3>Abyssinian Film Suddenly Stopped Showing</h3>
<p>Shanghai Grand Theater Refunds Tickets, Asks Soviet and American Consuls to Negotiate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grand Theater at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qujiang Road, before the screening of the "Abyssinia" film at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Italian consulate in Shanghai requested a ban on the screening. The theater ignored this, stating that it had obtained approval from the Central Film Censorship Board and had a license. However, when it continued to screen the film at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Chen Zeliang, the chief of the North Sichuan Road Police Station of the Municipal Police Bureau, suddenly led police officers to the theater to dissuade the screening and ordered the theater, saying, "In order to comply with the order, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has ordered that the screening of the 'Abyssinia' film be suspended immediately. This is the order, etc. Therefore, it is urgently ordered to obey this order." The theater had no choice but to stop the screening of the film and changed to screening a circus film. Disappointed, the audience members demanded refunds, which the theater immediately complied with. As the theater is run by Soviet merchants, it has reported the matter to the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai to request negotiation. It is also heard that although the film was produced by the Soviet Film News Factory, it is represented by the Asian Film Company, which is run by Americans. Therefore, the agent has also reported to the American Consulate in Shanghai to request negotiation.</p>
<h3>Police and Bandits Chase and Injure Each Other in East Jiaxing Road</h3>
<p>Sanxing Leather Shoe Workshop Robbed, Guo Desheng Captures a Bandit and Injures His Hand, Xu Kangkang Wounded in the Abdomen by Stray Bullet</p>
<p>Sanxing Leather Shoe Factory Workshop at No. 35, Lane 166 (Hengfeng Lane), East Jiaxing Road, was opened by Cao Bingsheng from Pudong. The upstairs is where Cao's family resides. At about 5:40 PM yesterday afternoon, suddenly eight bandits went to rob the workshop. Six bandits, carrying pistols, entered the door and first guarded all the partners, apprentices, and women in the workshop. Four bandits went upstairs to search Cao's bedroom, but there was nothing in the room. They only robbed twenty yuan in paper money. The bandits were not satisfied and noticed a gold ring on Cao's wife's hand, so they ordered her to take it off and put it in their pockets and escaped. The apprentices and partners in the workshop noticed the bandits leaving the house and followed them out on tiptoe. The bandits did not notice and continued along East Jiaxing Road towards Fengtian Road. The pursuers saw a guard post there and shouted loudly to catch the robbers. The bandits, hearing the alarm, were greatly panicked and quickly turned into Diswei Road to escape. At this time, the guard post had also arrived and chased and fired shots. The bandits also returned fire to resist arrest. By the time they reached the intersection of Oujia Road, the bandits had successively escaped, leaving only one bandit, hoping to flee towards the Chinese Concession. He was spotted by Guo Desheng, a Hubei native, No. 2440 guard post of the North Sichuan Road Police Station there, and he rushed forward and grabbed the bandit's waist. The bandit, in a panic, pulled out his gun and fired at Guo's left hand. The bullet pierced the back of his hand, grazed his abdomen, and Guo was seriously injured. His strength gradually failed, and he was about to release his hand. Fortunately, the concession guard post had arrived, and the bandit was captured and a pistol was seized. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the bandit's hand had also been shot earlier. The bandit was first taken to the police station and then transferred to the 工部局 (Gōng bù jú) Hospital for diagnosis and treatment before further investigation. Guo Desheng, the injured policeman, was also sent to the hospital by the police station to receive treatment. Fortunately, the injury was not serious and there was no danger. However, during the fierce battle to capture the bandit, Xu Kangkang, a local man, 30 years old, a member of the Fourth Brigade of the Zhabei Security Team, was injured in the abdomen by a stray bullet because he could not escape in time. The injury was very serious and he was also sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment afterwards. His condition is very critical. The escaped bandits are currently being pursued.</p>
<h3>Using Unemployed Elderly to Transport and Sell Counterfeit Money</h3>
<p>Manufacturing Agency Located in Kangdi Road, Defendants Detained Pending Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Jiang Futian and Li Xianyang, inspectors of the 法捕房 (Fǎ bǔ fáng) Special Agency, and Zhou Bingcheng, Xie Guangming, Shen Jinshu, Bu Zhenglong, and Tao Ronglin, detectives, received a confidential report at about 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, stating that there was a counterfeit money manufacturing agency that printed a large number of fake 中央 (Zhōngyāng) and other bank notes and used elderly unemployed people to transport and sell them. Today, someone is sending them to Fuxing Lane in East Zilaihuo Street, please send someone to guard and arrest them.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the detectives disguised themselves and went to Fuxing Lane and the entrance of No. 29 in the alley in East Zilaihuo Street to wait. Before long, they saw two elderly men walking around, looking around suspiciously. The detectives immediately stepped forward to arrest them and found 98 fake one-yuan 中央 (Zhōngyāng) Bank notes and 400 two-jiao Chinese Farmers Bank transfer notes on the two men. All of them were</p>
<p>taken to the police station.</p>
<p>One confessed that his name was Wang Zengjin, 65 years old, from Shaoxing, living at No. 18, Huining Road, 华界 (Huá jiè). He used to run a firewood shop and is now unemployed. These counterfeit notes were taken from Zhao Yixian at Han Yanjing's place and given to me to send to No. 29, Fuxing Lane, stating that I would be given a reward of five yuan. The other confessed that his name was Zhao Yixian, 52 years old, living at No. 8, Xingshun South Lane, Gansi East Road, and also confessed the addresses of many accomplices. The</p>
<p>original group of detectives</p>
<p>continued to go to No. 60, Yuelaifang, Caishi Road, and arrested Han Yanjing (44 years old, from Shaoxing). Han's family has a large scene and is equipped with a telephone to report information. At that time, Liu Yuxuan (31 years old, from Shandong, living at No. 9, Lane 31, Lujia Ferry, Pudong) went to Han's house to collect a membership fee. Han gave Liu a five-jiao 中央 (Zhōngyāng) Bank counterfeit note, so he was also arrested. They then went to No. 30, Chengyu Lane, Lane 221, Lafayide Road, and arrested Yang Fusheng (49 years old, from Ningbo), and brought them all to the police station. They confessed that the</p>
<p>manufacturing agency</p>
<p>was located in the pavilion room at No. 22, Kangyi Lane, Kangdi Road. The boss is Xie Amao, who lives on the front floor, etc. The detectives immediately rushed to the address. Xie Ba fled upon hearing the news. Only Xie's mistress, Xie Xiuzhen (23 years old, from Suzhou), was captured, and two printing oil rollers and a No. 100 patterned printing plate were seized (the patterned plate was found to have been purchased from the</p>
<p>Heiyue Company</p>
<p>of 石田旭山 (Shítián Xùshān) Co., Ltd. on Zhapu Road) and other items were taken back to the police station together. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second Court. Chen Daqi, the judge, interrogated them. Yuan Jiahuang, the lawyer of the Police Department, requested a two-week extension to investigate the details of the case and then sue for interrogation. Then, the handling detectives reported the process of solving the case. The court verified the report, briefly interrogated the defendants, and decided to reschedule the interrogation to the morning of February 1. The defendants were detained.</p>
<h3>Wang Baolu is Not a Pastor</h3>
<p>Further Trial of Caustic Soda Case, Investigation Reveals Debt Dispute</p>
<p>Wang Baolu, an old man from Yangzhou who claimed to be a pastor in the church, 59 years old, living at No. 7, Sida Lane, Shigao Tower Road, took a bottle of caustic soda on the afternoon of the 12th of this month at 7:40 PM to No. 26, Shoupin Lane, Huade Road, and poured it on the face of Qin Gengtao, a young clergyman from Chuansha, Pudong (26 years old). Qin also resisted at the time, causing Wang's forehead to be injured. Wang</p>
<p>saw the disaster he had caused, and fled back home. Later, Shan Huihai, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and investigated the incident. He immediately sent the defendant Qin Gengtao to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Wang's address was located on a road built beyond the boundary and belonged to the 华界 (Huá jiè). The police officers of the competent police station cooperated to arrest Wang and take him to the police station. His forehead was also</p>
<p>injured by caustic soda. He was sent to the patrol hospital for treatment. The next morning, the police station sent the case transfer form along with an empty bottle to the First Special District Court to prosecute Wang Baolu for injury under Article 278, Section 3 of the Criminal Law. Because both parties were in the hospital and could not testify in court, the reason for the incident was unknown. An extension was requested to allow Qin and Zhu to be interrogated after they recovered from their injuries. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing</p>
<p>visited the Third Criminal Court to investigate the case. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the 工部局 (Gōng bù jú), stated that the victim Qin Gengtao had arrived at the case and his injuries had slightly healed. It was found during the rescheduling that the defendant Wang Baolu was not a pastor. Jiang Changchuan, the chairman of the Shanghai Christian Preaching Federation, sent a letter to the police station stating, "After investigation, there is no Wang Baolu among the pastors in Shanghai. The churches cannot tolerate a pastor who is so unaware of offending others. However, Wang is probably just some</p>
<p>German servant, or he has recently suffered from mental illness. This is related to the reputation of the church, etc." The letter was presented for inspection. It was also found that the defendant had purchased a bottle of the caustic soda used in the incident from a pharmacy on Baoxing Road, Zhabei before the incident. His purpose at the time was to go to Qin Gengtao's house and blind his eyes with the caustic soda to vent his anger. Shan, the detective, and the Zhabei police officers</p>
<p>arrested the defendant and he readily admitted to his intentions, etc. The defendant confessed that he had known Qin Gengtao for more than seven years. At that time, he met him preaching at the entrance of the Baitu Bridge Gospel Church and introduced him to work as a staff member at the Sacred Book Society at No. 58, Hong Kong Road. Later, when his salary was not enough to cover his expenses, he often borrowed money from me to help him. He often came to my house for meals. Recently, on January 1 of this year, I entrusted a friend surnamed Cai</p>
<p>to arrange a marriage for him. I advanced him one hundred yuan before the marriage, and I was the guarantor. However, after he married his wife, he never came to my house again and broke off relations with me, saying that we should not have any contact. It was also heard from his mother-in-law that he now wanted to convert to Buddhism. That day, I went to his house to persuade him without success, and he poured caustic soda on me. I snatched it away and injured his face. The rest of his confession was evasive. The victim Qin Gengtao stated that he</p>
<p>worked at the Sacred Book Society on Hong Kong Road. He is a preacher at the society. We have known each other for many years. The hundred yuan he borrowed when I got married was guaranteed by him and has not been repaid. I have always been on good terms with him. People in our church respect Christ and aim to love and save people. The defendant should not have committed such a malicious act, etc. Judge Zhong ruled that Wang Baolu be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing to call witnesses for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Bus Overturns in Shanghai-Taizhou, Causing Disaster</h3>
<p>Twelve Passengers Injured, Cause Due to Driver's Carelessness</p>
<p>A long-distance bus No. 17 of the Shanghai-Taizhou Bus Company, which departed from Jiading for Shanghai at 11:10 AM yesterday, overturned on the side of the road near Shixianggong Temple due to the driver's carelessness. Twelve passengers in the bus were injured, four of whom were seriously injured, with head injuries, skull damage, and life-threatening conditions. They were subsequently sent to various hospitals in Shanghai, Jiading, Liuhe, and Taijiabao for treatment. The cause of the accident was that the top of the bus was overloaded with goods, and the driver was not a formal driver, but a copper worker who repaired cars, resulting in the accident.</p>
<h3>Part of Li Guojie Case to be Executed First</h3>
<p>50,000 Yuan of Stocks Pledged to Bank, Part of Maolu Farm Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, embezzled 700,000 taels of public funds. The local court is now executing the case, with a total of more than 1.2 million yuan in principal and interest. He has been summoned and pursued many times, but has not paid a penny. Because he escorted the remains of former Executive Duan to Beiping, the deadline was yesterday. Judge Wang Fengqiu of the execution court held a hearing in the Eighth Court for execution. Li Guojie did not arrive. Lv Shifang and Jiang Yiping, two lawyers, appeared in court as agents, stating that Li had returned to Shanghai, but was unable to attend court due to illness. The stocks investigated by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company did exist, but they had been pledged to the Siming Bank in 1933. A total of 30,000 yuan of stocks had been pledged and could be handed over for execution. In addition to these stocks, there was no property that could be seized. They requested that the court issue an execution license in accordance with Article 7 of the Execution Law. If Li could work in society in the future, he would slowly find a way to repay the debt (just like the 民間興隆票 (Mínjiān xīnglóng piào)), which would benefit both parties. They asked the plaintiff to forgive him, etc. Jiang Hechun, the agent lawyer of the plaintiff, stated that according to the defendant's lawyer, the stocks had been pledged to the Siming Bank. He requested that the execution be carried out first. According to a report, it was found that Li had a Maolu Farm in Jintan County, which proved that Li was not without property. It was difficult to agree with the provision in Article 7 that the debtor had no property that could be executed. At this point, lawyer Lv Shifang again stated that the Maolu Farm was run by Qian Renzu, with Ji Zhenggang as the manager. Because the management was poor, he had requested to take over the farm. Li could not develop the farm because there was no investment, so he did not take it over, which led to the outside world knowing that Li had run the farm. In fact, he had not taken it over and could be investigated. The stocks were worth 50,000 yuan, with 30,000 yuan pledged to the Siming Bank. There was also a commemorative watch worth 5,000 yuan, pledged to Zhou Shuwen, with approximately 3,000 yuan pledged. At this point, lawyer Jiang again stated that he did not oppose what the defendant's lawyer said, but he could not agree either. He could not express any opinion at this time and would report to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which would then report to the Ministry of Communications for further review. At this point, the court ruled that the first part, the stocks of the Siming Bank, should be handed over for execution first. The second part, the Maolu Farm in Jintan, should be investigated by both parties. The court would issue an official letter to the Jintan County government to be responsible for the investigation. After the reply was received, a hearing would be scheduled again.</p>
<h3>Wife Dies and Loses Job, Xiong Ping Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Extremely Miserable Situation</p>
<p>Xiong Li, a young woman from Yunnan, 23 years old, graduated from the Tongde Obstetrics Hospital. She recently set up her own hospital at No. 1013, Huade Road, Hongkou. On January 18, for some unknown reason, she secretly took sleeping pills and committed suicide. Her family discovered her and sent her to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but she died on January 21. Her husband, Xiong Ping, 26 years old, also from Yunnan, used to work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is currently the editor-in-chief of a bookstore. Recently, the bookstore declared bankruptcy due to the sluggish market. Xiong Ping was deeply traumatized by his wife's tragic death and the recent business failure. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, he suddenly had a suicidal thought and stabbed himself in the throat with a sharp knife. He was injured and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. He was sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment by his family. It is said that the injury was very serious.</p>
<h3>Illegal Gambling Den on the Waters of Xuejia浜</h3>
<p>Twenty-Five Gamblers Caught on the Jinbaotai Coal Ship</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around two o'clock, Wei, the Chief of the Municipal Police Water Patrol Team, dispatched officers Zhang Guanyun and others to patrol the Huangpu River. When they reached the waters off Xuejia浜, they suddenly heard a cacophony of voices from the Jinbaotai coal ship. Upon investigation, they discovered a group of people gambling inside. They immediately reported back to the Chief, who ordered Inspector Pan Xiutong to lead a large contingent of police to the scene. The gamblers, engrossed in their games, were caught completely off guard by the police raid. Twenty-five gamblers, including Jin Lianghai and Ruan Gengquan, were apprehended on the spot, along with gambling paraphernalia and confiscated gambling money. The entire group was taken back to the station for interrogation. Given the late-night nature of the gambling and the gathering of a crowd, orders were issued yesterday afternoon to prepare a formal report, including witness statements, to be sent to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>National YMCA Mourns Yu Rizhang Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Association of Chinese Christian Youth held a memorial service yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to commemorate Yu Rizhang, the former General Secretary of the Association. Attendees included Association staff, Yu's family, and Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, who also sent a wreath. Pastor Yu Ensi presided over the service, with Bishop Wu Shide delivering a speech and Fu Ruoyu offering condolences.</p>
<h3>Paramount Employees Sue Directors After Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>Claims are for Unpaid Wages and Breach of Contract; Court Will Summon Witnesses for Further Investigation</p>
<p>The Paramount Grand Hotel, established by Dacheng Co., Ltd., which also operated a dance business, went bankrupt on August 5th of last year, owing more than 300,000 yuan. After being sued by various creditors, the company also filed for bankruptcy with the First Special District Court, where the matter is still being processed. Now, sixteen of its creditors, including foreign employees like Omore, allege that the company's bankruptcy was a fraudulent act. Through their lawyers, they have filed a criminal self-indictment against Zhang Qinbo, Chairman of Dacheng, Zhu Ruhong, Director and General Manager of Paramount, and Directors Zheng Xitao and Gu Liancheng with the First Special Court, requesting that they be investigated in accordance with Articles 152 and 154 of the Bankruptcy Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Fu Lin opened the court to hear the case. Only Zheng, Gu, and Jin, three of the defendants, appeared; the others were absent. The plaintiffs' lawyers presented their arguments, stating that the amounts owed to the plaintiffs were either for unpaid wages or for breach of contract, and that separate civil suits had already been filed. However, the company has failed to fully submit its accounting books, and the minutes of the board meetings have been concealed. The defendants, as those responsible for the company, cannot evade responsibility. Furthermore, it was argued that by the end of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), Dacheng's capital had already been almost entirely depleted, yet the defendants failed to declare bankruptcy as required by law and continued to operate, causing losses to third parties. This conduct clearly violated the provisions of Articles 152 and 154 of the Bankruptcy Law. The plaintiffs requested that the civil lawsuit files be reviewed and that the bankruptcy administrator be examined to clarify the matter. As for the defendants who failed to appear, they requested that arrest warrants be issued. In court, Zheng Xitao testified that he and the other defendants were directors of Dacheng, with Zhang as chairman and Zhu concurrently serving as general manager. However, Jin had resigned. Board meetings were held in the general manager's office, and there were meeting minutes. These records may have been lost when the company's assets were auctioned off. All other records have been handed over, and there has been no concealment. Judge Fu stated that the case still required further investigation and ordered a continuation of the hearing on the afternoon of the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3>Pawned Everything, Attempted Suicide but Failed: Driven to Crime by Circumstances</h3>
<p>Chen Kaiyuan Frauds Post Office Deposits Due to Desperation; Law is Not Devoid of Human Sentiment, Sentence Suspended</p>
<p>Chen Kaiyuan, a Cantonese man, is 25 years old, graduated from Peking University, married a woman named Wang, and has a two-year-old child. Chen recently brought his wife and children to Shanghai to make a living, residing in room number six of the Zhongshe Dormitory at 656 Weihaiwei Road. Being unfamiliar with the place and without relatives, he has been unable to find work for several months, while daily necessities cannot be dispensed with. As a result, all valuables have been</p>
<p>pawned to exhaustion. The Zhongshe dormitory fees are owed for as long as four months, but because Chen is normally amiable and of upright character, the Zhongshe supervisor not only did not pursue the matter but even lent him more than seventy yuan. Now Chen's wife is six months pregnant and about to give birth, requiring money for medical expenses, placing Chen in a situation no different from a living hell. He repeatedly considered suicide, but because of his love for his wife and child, he could not bear to do so. Therefore, after racking his brains, he decided to</p>
<p>take a risk. On the morning of the 18th, he managed to borrow ten yuan and, using the name of Lü Yanshen, deposited it at the Seymour Road Post Office. That same afternoon, he withdrew nine yuan from the Fujian Road Post Office, leaving a balance of one yuan. Then, Chen had three stamps made at the Mingzhi Engraving Shop at 1319 North Sichuan Road, by Wu Zikun, an apprentice from Changzhou, replicating the post office stamp and the two staff stamps on the deposit book. He then filled in a deposit of</p>
<p>two hundred yuan on the deposit book for the 19th and, at 9:30 AM yesterday morning, again went to the Fujian Road Post Office to attempt to withdraw fifty yuan. However, the post office detected the fraud and reported it to the Laozao Police Station. Chinese Detective Zhang Yuanjing and Detective Xue Youwen arrested Chen. Subsequently, Wu Zikun, who made the stamps, was also apprehended. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division. Police Barrister Ru Baoyi explained the case and charged Chen with</p>
<p>attempted fraud and forgery of seals under Article 339, paragraph 3, and Article 218 of the Criminal Law. Chen Kaiyuan was defended by Barrister Le Junwei. When questioned, Chen Kaiyuan confessed that he had resorted to this desperate measure due to the pressure of life. Wu Zikun stated that when he made the stamps, he did not know that they were forgeries. Then, Police Barrister Ru stated that the facts of the defendant Chen Kaiyuan's crime were very clear, but he was a highly educated man who had</p>
<p>been forced by circumstances to take a risk, leading him to break the law. Furthermore, he had no prior criminal record. He asked the court to consider this point when sentencing and grant him a suspended sentence so that he could reform. Barrister Le, defending the defendant, said that he had learned about the matter yesterday while at Zhongshe and, seeing the defendant's pitiful situation, knew that it was not intentional. Therefore, he was providing his services free of charge today. He asked the court to</p>
<p>show leniency and impose a lenient sentence. Chen Kaiyuan and his wife and children, who were in the audience, were all weeping silently, a truly tragic scene. Chief Judge Feng Shide reviewed the case and announced the verdict: Chen Kaiyuan was sentenced to six months imprisonment for attempted fraud, suspended for two years. Wu Zikun was acquitted, and the forged stamps were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Postal Workers' Union Elects New Executive and Supervisory Committees Yesterday</h3>
<p>The term of the 13th Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union expired in September of last year. Elections should have been held immediately, but they were repeatedly postponed due to the election of representatives to the National Assembly and the Xi'an Incident involving Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Finally, the 14th First Representative Assembly was held at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon in the hall on the third floor of the Shanghai Postal Administration, and the 14th Executive and Supervisory Committees were elected at the same time. A total of 117 representatives attended, and Cui Buwu, representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Zhu Xuefan, representing the National Postal Workers' Union, attended and gave speeches. After formal greetings, the chairman first reported on the purpose of the meeting, followed by reports on the important union affairs of the past year by the 13th Executive and Supervisory Committees. Then, Cui Buwu, representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, stating that he was very honored to participate in the meeting and had always admired the union. After hearing the chairman's and other comrades' reports on union affairs, he was even more convinced that the union's work had been outstanding. People across the country know that the Postal Workers' Union is the most well-organized and excellent union. This is the result of the union comrades' hard work and efforts. He was confident that the union would continue to maintain its past glory and carry it forward. Next, Comrade Zhu Xuefan of the National Postal Workers' Union delivered a speech, stating that the purpose of the representative assembly was to elect new executive and supervisory committees. What everyone should pay attention to, of course, are the words "elect new," but it must be known that electing new is only a formality. What we should pay more attention to is the spirit. Merely having a form without a spirit will never be able to relieve our pain or fulfill our original intentions. The success of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union is not based on its long history, but on the spiritual unity of all postal workers. If we want to preserve and promote past glory, we must value the word spirit. In the future, we should still follow the three major goals of serving the country, serving the organization, and serving the members, and continue to work hard. Finally, Comrade Zhu put forward the following three points: ① Promote thrift, ② Promote postal worker welfare, ③ All member disputes should be resolved by the union. He sincerely hoped that all representatives and the next committee would heed these three points. The speech was lengthy, so we will omit the rest. Finally, the election was held. The election results are recorded below: (A) Formal Executive Committee: 1. Xiao Qingshan, 2. Fan Caicong, 3. Lu Keming, 4. Cheng Zuoqing, 5. Zhang Zuoqi, 6. Wang Kai, 7. Wu Yaxiong, 8.

It is hoped that businesses in all sectors will participate as soon as possible to avoid missing the deadline.</p>
<h3>Cook Murder Case</h3>
<p>Struck in the Abdomen with a Fist, Chef Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Gan Zhongyi, a chef from Songjiang who worked at the Yushuntai restaurant at 5 Cichang Lane, Sichuan Road, was 52 years old. The day before yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, he had a work-related dispute with his colleague Zhang Xiaomao (a 26-year-old from Ningbo). Zhang struck Gan's abdomen severely. Afterwards, the restaurant owner, Li Longchang, took Gan to Renji Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he died at 6:45 PM that evening. The hospital reported the death to the General Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. Zhang was arrested and detained at the police station, and Gan's body was transported to the Fielun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Judge Tang of the First Special District Court, accompanied by two medical examiners, Wei and Zhang, and a clerk, arrived at the morgue. After examining the body, they took their seats in court. According to Zhang Xiaomao's statement, at 8:30 AM the day before yesterday, Gan was peeling shrimp in the restaurant, and he was cutting tofu. Gan suddenly told him to cut potatoes, but he refused because the wok was not empty. Gan then used foul language, and he struck him once. Li Longchang and Xu Xiaodi testified to the situation at the time. Judge Tang then ruled that the deceased, Gan Zhongyi, was a male who had died from being struck in the abdomen by Zhang Xiaomao while alive. The body was handed over to his nephew, Gan Futao, who signed a receipt for the corpse.</p>
<h3>Female Police Officers in the City Begin Outside Patrols</h3>
<p>Uniforms Identical to Male Officers</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, female police officers in the city began their duties nearly a month ago and have had very good results, which have been praised by their superiors. However, they were previously only working in internal affairs, and were not seen much on the streets. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter passed by the West Gate and saw a group of female police officers, led by a police officer, patrolling the area along the West Gate Wenmiao Road, Zhonghua Road, Zhaojiabang Road, and Jingxiu Road. They were cracking down on street vendors and illegal stalls to avoid obstructing traffic, and patiently persuading people, which attracted the attention of passersby. Their uniforms are identical to those of male police officers, except that they are slightly shorter and have the words "female police" on their shoulder badges.</p>
<h3>Three Rice Industry Associations Issue Notice to Stop Illegal Deductions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Grain Merchants' Trade Union, the Shanghai Northern Jiangsu Rice Transporters' United Association, and the Shanghai Changshu Guild jointly announced: Notice is hereby given: According to reports from the members of our associations, the Jiangsu, Nanjing, Shanghai, and County Rice Industry Associations Federation illegally entrusts the Bean and Rice Industry Trade Union to deduct a fee of one cent per stone (unit of measurement) as membership dues, which has caused unanimous opposition from rice merchants. The membership dues of that federation should legally be borne by the members who have joined that federation. To deduct dues from rice merchants is a violation of current laws and regulations. After appealing to the Party and government agencies to stop this practice, we received instructions from the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Zhizi No. 4822, stating, "Regarding the request to stop the Jiangsu, Nanjing, Shanghai, and County Rice Industry Associations Federation from illegally deducting membership dues," "Noted. We have already issued orders to the said federation and the Bean and Rice Industry Trade Union to stop this practice and have also sent a letter to the Bureau of Social Affairs to investigate." In accordance with these instructions, we have recorded and promulgated the case. We hope that all rice merchants will be informed. This notice is hereby given.</p>
<h3>YMCA Comforts Wounded Soldiers in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the YMCA National Association's War Zone Servicemen's Center in Suiyuan, various programs have been launched. Yesterday, the Association received a letter from Suiyuan reporting that a Comfort and Entertainment Gala for Wounded Soldiers had been held on the 17th, lasting three days at the Public Assembly Hall. The wounded soldiers were transported by car, and over 7,000 soldiers and civilians attended over the three days, creating much excitement. Although Suiyuan already has one silent film projector, they hope to watch a sound film. Therefore, they hope to raise funds in Shanghai to purchase a sound film projector and transport it to Suiyuan. Due to budgetary constraints, the Association has decided to raise funds from all sectors. Furthermore, the wounded soldiers in Suiyuan are in urgent need of towels and daily necessities. Upon receiving the report, the Association has separately requested donations from large companies in this city such as Wing On, Sincere, New New, and Amoy. It is expected that those who love the country and do not want to fall behind will generously donate. The Suiyuan Service Center urgently needs these supplies to be transported so that they can be distributed to the wounded soldiers. The Servicemen's Center has recently sent people to start new operations in Datong Pingdiquan and has already begun work.</p>
<h3>Capital Express Refund Policy and Cabin Occupancy Regulations</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway's Capital Express operates on the principle that each passenger receives a seat. After this policy was implemented, all passengers who purchase tickets must have a seat reserved for them. However, if a passenger requests a refund or changes to another train after the train has departed, the seat reserved by the railway will inevitably be wasted. Therefore, it is proposed that passengers with tickets for the Capital Express who need a refund or change to another train must contact the ticket office half an hour before the train departs. Otherwise, the ticket will be considered invalid. In addition, the Capital Express has three cabins. If four passengers, they can reserve one cabin. If there are fewer than four people but they want to occupy a cabin, they will be required to purchase tickets for the actual number of people plus pay half price for the unoccupied seats. After this bureau submitted the above two methods to the Ministry of Railways for review, it received Order No. 405 from the Industry Department, stating that the proposed Capital Express refund method has been approved and placed on file. Regarding the cabin occupancy regulations, it is instructed to comply with the provisions of Article 31, Paragraph 1 of the seventh edition of the Passenger Car Transportation Regulations, which requires the purchase of four full tickets to reserve one cabin.</p>

<p>The Municipal Council Music Band will hold a concert tomorrow (the 24th) afternoon at the Lyceum Theater on Pu Shi Road. Chinese female pianist Xia Guoqiong has been invited to be the main performer of "Hungarian Fantasia," accompanied by the entire band. This is the first time the band has collaborated with a Chinese artist. Ms. Xia is a top student of the famous Russian piano professor Zakharov in this city. She has studied piano with Zakharov for nine years and is not only skilled but also highly praised by Zakharov. Last year, she traveled to Japan, where music authorities such as Omaki Masao and Yamane Ginji also expressed their admiration and invited Ms. Xia to return to Japan this spring to hold a solo concert. This shows the high praise from international figures. The piece that Ms. Xia will perform tomorrow is a work by the 19th-century Hungarian Romantic composer Liszt. The performance of this piece will last for thirty minutes. The work is beautiful in content, powerful in expression, and magnificent in spirit. It requires profound cultivation to perform successfully. Ms. Xia has already practiced with the Municipal Council Band once, and the entire band praised her unanimously. They also hosted a banquet after the practice to celebrate her success, showing how wonderful her performance is.</p>

<h3>Zhu Xiaoheshang Gets a Large River Pig</h3>
<p>Completely Black, No Scales, No Hair; Weighs Over Ten Loads</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoheshang of Chongming saw an object on the beach a few days ago, completely black and as big as an ox. At first, he thought it was a dead fish. After carefully observing its shape, he realized it was not dead. The creature, because of its huge size, had mistakenly entered the shallows and lost its ability to move automatically, making it unable to withdraw from the beach. He immediately summoned the villagers to carry it onto a boat and transport it to the city center to try to sell it. Because no one inquired about it, it was transported to the Yunzao浜 in Wusong to be docked. For a time, crowds of people gathered. Those who were curious hired ferry sampans to go to the boat to watch it, as a result the many dozens of sampans were too few to keep up with the demand. The sampan boatmen took the opportunity to make a lot of unexpected business. It is said that this object is called a river pig, and its size is very different from those seen in the Huangpu Port. Because it is produced in salt water, it is so big, weighing about ten loads. It is completely black, without scales or hair, its head is like a pig, but its nose is longer. Although there were many viewers, there were also no buyers. Afterwards, Zhu Xiaoheshang still took it back to Chongming, intending to boil it for oil and sell it.</p>
<h3>Accusation of Obscene Conduct Against Zhang Sheng</h3>
<p>Zhang Shengzhi, a 45-year-old man from Jiangxi residing at No. 52 Baoxing Li, Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession, runs a cotton business in Shanghai. Zhang, misled by rumors and the art of "collecting yin to supplement yang," employs young maids, always selecting young women, to carry out his inhumane and selfish practices. To date, he has employed and replaced nearly twenty women. Approximately two days ago, he hired Zhang Cuizhen (21 years old), a woman from Suzhou, through a broker to work at his residence. Finding her appearance pleasing, Zhang attempted to act indecently. When she refused and wanted to quit, Zhang forcibly withheld her gold ring as blackmail. The woman reported this to the French police station the day before. Detective Wang Zhihao investigated and discovered the concealed details. Zhang was arrested and brought before the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday. The legal counsel for the police requested an extension for investigation. Judge Chen Daqi questioned both the plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant requested a lawyer for defense and asked to be released on bail. The court ordered a rescheduled hearing on the 26th. The defendant provided a surety of 600 yuan; failing that, he was detained.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Native Association Aids Shanghai Ningbo Daily</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ningbo Native Association held a joint meeting of executives and supervisors the other day and resolved to assist the Shanghai Ningbo Daily to expand its business and enrich its internal content in order to maintain its permanent standing. Yesterday afternoon, they specifically discussed assistance methods with Mr. Wang Beiping, the person in charge of the newspaper, and the following was decided: ① "Expanding the size": starting after the winter vacation this year, the newspaper will be published daily with two pages, typeset entirely in No. 6 font; ② "Improving content": in addition to adding political news and a Shanghai social section, a daily association affairs report column will be created; ③ ""Enriching the news of the seven counties": letters will be sent to the township offices of the seven counties, asking them to be responsible for daily news reports; ④ "Improving the supplement": in addition to restoring the "Reminiscences of Siming" and "Compatriot Service" columns, the original "Big Collection of Foreign Affairs" column will be edited by experts, without limiting local characteristics, and focusing on popular appeal; ⑤ ""Promoting sales": in addition to soliciting the original 6,270 copies distributed by the two distribution departments, the association will notify all members to offer a free month's subscription starting March 1, 26th year [of the Republic], (limited to members of the association), then charge one yuan every three months; ⑥ "Introducing advertisements": to increase revenue, the association will send letters to major companies and businesses owned by fellow Ningbo natives, asking them for monthly subsidies or to order long-term advertisements. Contracts have already been drafted with 50 companies. Association representatives Mr. Dong Xinqin and Mr. Shao Xiangqing will separately handle contacts; ⑦ "Regarding the newspaper's third anniversary celebration last year": many Ningbo natives in Shanghai agreed to sponsor, and while many have paid, some have yet to do so. The association plans to send letters to each native, urging them to fulfill their initial commitments and provide sponsorship in advance to facilitate expansion; ⑧ "The association has more than 100,000 old members in total": providing a free month's subscription would require a large amount of paper, printing, and other expenses. It should be maintained. In addition to advertising revenue, it can be allocated from the aforementioned funds donated by fellow natives.</p>

<p>Li Weiguang, a medical graduate from Tokyo University in Japan, specializes in pediatrics and also practices internal medicine. He is experienced and accurate in diagnosis. He founded a hospital in Xiamen more than ten years ago, with remarkable achievements and a widespread reputation. To this day, in southern Fujian, regardless of gender or age, everyone knows of Dr. Li's medical achievements and admires him. After leaving Fujian and practicing medicine in Shanghai for three years, all those who seek his consultation are pleased with his successful treatments. Recently, he has also invented a smoking cessation medicine called "An Di Du Jin Injection," with miraculous effects. Whether for new or heavy addicts, it can be guaranteed to cure the addiction completely in four days without any pain. It is said that Dr. Li spent more than ten years of effort, researching day and night, using the latest scientific methods and endocrine preparation to create this medicine. Since the success of this medicine, he has helped hundreds of people quit smoking addiction.

<p>Opening of the Shanghai Branch of the Beiyang Printing House The Beiyang Printing House, which pioneered the translation and printing of Western books nationwide, has been established for over twenty years, publishing thousands of books, especially famous engineering works.

Most of the Western book translation and printing houses and textbook publishers of major middle schools in Shanghai are supplied by the Beiyang Printing House. However, customers often feel that going through middlemen is not economical in terms of both time and money, and they have requested direct sales to achieve the goal of cooperation between production and consumption. In view of the enthusiasm of customers and the company's desire to reduce the burden on readers, the company has expanded its scope and established branch offices at No. 1550 Zhonghua Road and No. 19 Fangxie Road, near the Chen Yingshi Memorial Tower at the Lao Ximen entrance in this city. The grand opening is scheduled for today. A month-long sale is being held, with all translated Western books sold at a 60% discount.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editors: The report on the case of Lu Xingrong suing Lu Youchen for alimony, published in your newspaper on the 17th, does not match the facts. This case was initiated by Lu Xingrong's relative, Wang Liangyu, who accompanied Lu Xingrong to this lawyer's office on August 18, 25th year [of the Republic], where she personally signed the engagement contract and power of attorney. Later, due to the application for litigation assistance, Lu Xingrong personally handed over many pawn tickets, which this lawyer submitted on her behalf. These pawn tickets all belonged to the woman herself, as she stated and retrieved them in court. Her relative did not entrust the engagement. There are records of the engagement contract and power of attorney to prove this. Accordingly, we request your newspaper to make a correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Xu Jiashi, January 21.</p>

<h3>How to Raise Your Children</h3>
<p>— Luo Zheng</p>
<p>Some say: Children are the foundation of the nation, and the nation is the basis of the country. If we want to talk about saving the country, we should naturally first strengthen the foundation of the country. To strengthen the foundation of the country, we need to cultivate the foundation of the nation. Therefore, our research on children's issues is the only urgent task at hand. Now, whether it is from the perspective of education, health, or even thought and movement, we should guide them forward on the path of the times.</p>
<p>Raising children is not an easy task. It is more important than undertaking any work because in early childhood, we only need to pay attention, and then we can discover how every normal child should spend the years before entering school. During this period, all kinds of healthy habits and all the physical and mental characteristics necessary for being a person in the future must be formed and perfected. Until entering school, all their habits and characteristics must undergo a degree of transformation and training. Because children are just a kind of larvae in humans, in terms of health, what they need is proper sleep, proper food, and a considerable amount and kind of play. At the same time, a certain amount of time should be set aside to carry out physical examinations to prepare for preventing the occurrence of diseases.</p>
<p>Every child is rich in creativity and imitative ability, but also rich in destructiveness—no matter what paper or object they get, they will make it into a shapeless thing, and they will also imitate others' every move, but at the same time, they will also destroy a good thing. Especially they are good at liking the new and disliking the old. No matter food or toys, when they first get them, they are always happy, but after playing with them for a while, they will hate and abandon them. Their desire for knowledge is also very strong, which can be seen anytime and anywhere. Whenever they see something or get something, they always like to get to the bottom of it with adults; so, at this time, as long as adults enlighten them with correct knowledge, they will definitely understand it easily. Therefore, general parents should adopt the following attitudes towards their children: ① Maintain a calm attitude. If young children are disobedient, if you yourself become excessively tense and excited as a result, it will cause children who like stimulation to often be disobedient. ② Give children their own playgrounds and toys. If children spend too much time with adults, their creative and spontaneous nature will be limited by imitation. ③ When children see something interesting and reach out to take it, do not stop them or take the object away. Because at this time their independence is destroyed, and the child feels that they must rely on adults. ④ Make the child's daily life disciplined and let him follow a daily routine, not allowing him to overstep it; because adhering to routines is the shortcut to success in future life.</p>
<p>Now, I have tentatively made a daily routine schedule for general school-age children below.——Some points in this article have been referenced from "Child Rearing Maxims" written by Ms. Ahme Hostlo, Professor of Nursing at Western Reserve University in the United States, translated by Wen Zhenjun.</p>
<p>Get up at 7:00 AM every morning, wash your face and brush your teeth yourself, the less help from others the better, after washing up, have breakfast immediately. At 8:30 AM, take a spoonful of cod liver oil, then go outdoors to play. At 10:00 AM, drink a small cup of orange juice. At 11:00 AM, take a bath and prepare lunch. Rest for twenty minutes before lunch. Lunch should be eaten by oneself and not fed by others. Around 1:00 PM in the afternoon is nap time. At 3:00 PM, drink a cup of milk and go out to play again. At 5:30 PM, have dinner, after dinner, stay indoors for small games until bedtime. Go to bed at 7:00 PM. Every day, you should go to the suburbs or parks to absorb fresh air.——</p>
<p>But unfortunately, such a simple and complete life table cannot be enjoyed by general Chinese children: if there is such a nanny or parent in China, then only the sons and daughters of a small number of bourgeoisie can implement it. But I hope that every Chinese child will have this right; so I would like to present this "Children's Life Procedure" to every child in the new China.</p>
<p>Children's issues have always been highly valued in European, American, and Japanese countries. Even Hitler, who advocated dictatorship, once promoted eugenics, and the world's old man Mussolini also rewarded childbirth last year. Japan's efforts in children's education are even more vigorous. Even our ancient country paid attention to early childhood education, "Once, Mencius' mother chose to live near a cemetery," is one example, but in some periods before, such a serious fundamental problem was ignored by the people of the country. But in this extraordinary period, please, women, transform the environment of these future masters!</p>
<h3>The Homespun Cloth Skirt and Jacket of Hunan Female Students</h3>
<p>— De Lin</p>
<p>Women's vanity is greater than that of men. They are always fantasizing: "Clothes must be brocade," "Residences must be magnificent": otherwise, it is not enough to show their extravagance and wealth. In recent years, due to the sluggishness of my country's industry and commerce, the influx of foreign goods, and the alarming trade deficit, some people believe that women are the most powerful members in promoting foreign goods; if you don't believe it, just look at their daily essential cosmetics, perfumes, and clothing made of cotton and wool fabrics, most of which are imported goods, but their deeply rooted vanity is also an undeniable fact, which they see as more important than anything else. However, we cannot generalize with one stroke: only the homespun cloth skirts and jackets of Hunan female students are worthy of admiration and should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Under the political leadership of Chairman He Yunqiao in Hunan Province, the development of education is unmatched nationwide. Just in the first session, schools are everywhere, and those in charge are able to work hard and implement complete measures. The spirit of the students is also full of vitality, and especially the simple student uniforms are eye-catching in the prosperous streets. The students you see, regardless of gender, wear a uniform made of plain homespun cloth all year round, but rarely wear silk and wool fabrics; especially female students not only wear the same homespun cloth skirts and jackets, but also do not use cosmetics. As for the homespun raw materials for making clothes, they are purely self-spun, self-woven, and self-dyed from the countryside, which can be called completely domestic products.</p>
<p>Their clothing is mostly a kind of short jacket and short skirt. The upper body wears a plain homespun cloth jacket, and the lower body is matched with a knee-length plain homespun cloth skirt. The hair covering the forehead and bright eyes are on the right part of the chest, embroidered with the name of the school and the number listed in the school with white floss. Although they do not apply rouge or powder, that kind of light makeup and plain attire has a unique style and reveals a natural healthy beauty, which is unmatched by the female students in Jiangsu and Zhejiang who cut their hair and wear fashionable clothes.</p>
<h3>Heroines in the Spanish War (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Bo Ken</p>
<p>Ms. Victoria had never been to the front lines. She was too frail. But her thinking was very progressive. She argued that women joining the army not only encouraged male soldiers to want to perform meritorious service in front of women, but also made them work even harder. So as to maintain the traditional advantage of men over women in war.</p>
<p>Probably because she had always been good at organization, she is currently serving as the general manager of recruiting women's armies. The recruitment office is located in a new-style hotel in Barcelona, ​​with a wooden sign hanging at the door: "General Office of the Catalan Women's Camp" Inside, typists and stenographers were busy working. A long table was placed in the center, with four female committee members sitting at the top; they were reviewing about twenty prospective female soldiers arranged at the bottom. Among these Spanish women who volunteered to join the army were factory women in tattered clothes, smart and petite female shop assistants, female students who had studied education, and even luxurious socialites. One by one, they were summoned to the female committee members. Physical examinations are not required; a simple oral test and a quick look are enough. As a result, half were sent to the front lines and half remained in the rear to serve.</p>
<p>Women serving in the rear are divided into groups to perform three tasks—cooking, nursing the wounded, and taking care of the children of women who went to the front lines. Women who went to the front lines were also divided into groups and incorporated into three armies—infantry, artillery, and air force.</p>
<p>On the side of the Spanish rebels, there was also a prominent female warrior. Her name is Senorita Dolores. She was the daughter of the late Diec Teto. Of all the Spanish female warriors, she was the most beautiful.</p>
<p>It is said that Ms. Senorita Dolores once worked as a chauffeur for the "Death Patrols." In the Catalan provinces and cities occupied by the government forces, government military officers patrolled in cars every night. The death patrols on the rebel side wore clothes that imitated government military officers and rode in cars painted with the emblems of the government forces, mixed into the city. Seeing a government patrol car speeding towards them, they threw a bomb under its wheels. After the smoke cleared, only a pile of scrap iron and dismembered bodies remained. In this way, they galloped around, waiting for the patrol car to attack. When the whole city was rioting, they abandoned their cars and fled.</p>
<p>In this Spanish civil war, there was also a generous female warrior who died as a martyr. This is Ms. Anila Lopez. She was originally a clerk at a pharmacy in Merida, but later became an important assistant to Ms. Xifanlian and Ms. Victoria Gantuo. Her face was as ugly as a village woman, but she was a scholar. "She knows Latin," her villagers often praised her. She also knew Spanish history well. She remembered the story of Queen Isabella—Columbus's benefactor—leading the army to drive the Moors out of Spain.</p>
<p>When she heard the news that General Franco was leading the Moors to seize Merida, the traditional terror of Muslims made her begin emergency measures. She gathered the villagers and organized a defense team. She arranged to install landmines under streets, squares, and public buildings. She knew that by simply pressing a button, she could kill the enemy troops cleanly, although the entire village would also be turned into scorched earth.</p>
<p>However, when the enemy troops arrived, the idea of ​​cherishing the lives of the villagers immediately made her change her mind. She left the button and walked to the enemy troops, boldly captured. The savage Moorish soldiers tied her up unceremoniously, and merciless bullets instantly ended her life. Her last words were: "At least, I died too young." This shows that she was not afraid of death, but regretted dying without fulfilling her responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Japanese Bride Schools</h3>
<p>— Shadow</p>
<p>Japan has bride schools, and although they have only existed for a few years, they have developed at a high speed in recent years, and their establishment has already affected general girls' high schools. The only reason why Japanese girls are unwilling to enter high schools and instead want to go to bride schools is that the tuition fees of bride schools are lower, and they can receive training in all the subjects required to be a Japanese wife in a very short period. The curriculum includes sewing, housework, flower arrangement, tea party preparation, and various etiquette for housewives. As for ordinary girls' high schools, it takes at least three years to complete all the subjects, saving both money and time, so that after graduating from middle school, most girls want to enter these bride schools.</p>
<p>According to Japanese newspapers, a girls' high school that had as many as four hundred students a few years ago now has only a little over one hundred. This is undoubtedly influenced by the bride schools, at least the length of the school year is a major reason. Therefore, the main way for Japanese girls' high schools to deal with these bride schools is to shorten the graduation period. It is said that some of the bride schools are founded and taught by female graduates of high schools. Now, except for medical and obstetrical schools for women, general girls' high schools have been affected, and the number of students is decreasing rapidly.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also know that in Japanese girls' middle schools, when students are about to graduate, a period of time is usually designated as bride training in the year before graduation. This is because these girls are about to graduate, and although some of them want to continue their studies after graduation, most of them are afraid that they will not be able to continue their education and will have to enter society to find a job to support themselves. Some of them are already of marriageable age, and it is even possible that they will get married. Although there are courses such as domestic science, sewing, and cooking in the curriculum during normal school hours, the Japanese school authorities believe that these are not enough, so they designate a period of time for specialized bride training to supplement the usual deficiencies.</p>
<p>The matter is very interesting. The female students do not even go home during training, but live in the school. They cook their own food, wash their own clothes, sweep the classrooms, and tidy the rooms. All the housework has to be done. In other words, everything a new bride should do has to be practiced. Japanese women have a natural obedience that is unmatched by women in any other country. The reason why schools implement new bride training is of course to hope that all female students can become good wives and mothers after marriage, and that after undergoing considerable training in school before marriage, they can handle everything in terms of housework without having to learn from their in-laws. Not only is this the case in Japanese girls' schools, but Japanese schools established by overseas Japanese also have special courses in new bride training in the final semester.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge of Women and Bathing</h3>
<p>— Cao Yixuan</p>
<p>Bathing is very effective for the health of body and mind. However, developing the habit of bathing and common knowledge of bathing are essential requirements for housewives. Now I will roughly talk about the points to pay attention to when bathing and the benefits of bathing: First, when you come back from outside after being blown by the cold wind, you must never take a bath immediately. Before bathing, you must warm your body first, because when the body is cold, the blood vessels in the skin are all contracted. Suddenly walking into the bathtub will cause the blood vessels to expand rapidly, then the contraction and expansion of the skin's blood vessels will be damaged, which is the cause of vascular diseases. If there is no bathing equipment in the home, and you go to a public bathhouse to take a bath, you should rest for twenty minutes after entering the bathhouse before taking off your clothes and entering the bath. Second, you should not take a bath immediately after strenuous exercise or mental labor. You should first calm your body or rest for an hour to restore your mental fatigue before taking a bath. Second, pay more attention to the temperature of the bath water. Do not immediately immerse yourself in very hot water. First, use low-temperature water of 38 to 40 degrees to soak your whole body for five minutes, then increase the water temperature to 42 to 43 degrees. For the elderly, women, and people with chronic kidney disease and arteriosclerosis, 40 degrees is appropriate, and 28 to 29 degrees is enough for children. Therefore, the bath water should be tested with a thermometer first. Fourth, you must never take a bath when you are hungry or full. You should wait eleven or twelve hours after eating. Winter is best before going to bed, because it is easy to fall asleep. After a normal bath, you must keep your body warm for an hour. Pregnant women should not soak in hot water for a long time, because prolonged high temperature in the lower abdomen will cause the uterine muscles to contract, often causing miscarriage. As for the reason why bathing can protect the health of body and mind, it is that bathing stimulates the skin and can promote the activity of internal organs. Generally, when living in a cold climate, the skin of the whole body is tense, and the spirit feels tired. At the same time, in order to prevent the loss of body temperature, the blood vessels of the whole body contract to the extreme, and the blood is sent to the internal organs. Because the blood vessels of the skin contract, the blood vessels of the brain also contract, so the blood circulation in the brain is also slow. That is, the nutrition in the brain is not good, and old waste accumulates and does not move. At this time, the spirit is tired, the nerves are excited, and the whole body feels more tired. On the other hand, the various centers that coordinate the functions of the internal organs lose nutrition due to the sluggish blood circulation, and the functions of the lungs, stomach, intestines, and endocrine organs are all adversely affected, and the body is naturally uncomfortable. Therefore, housewives should pay full attention to their children's bathing. Originally, the strength of children's bodies is entirely the responsibility of housewives. It is really shameful for housewives not to understand the common sense of bathing in modern society. The physiological effect of warm water bathing is of great significance to the skin, that is, there are many blood vessels in the skin, like a fine net. About half of the total amount of blood in our whole body is on the skin. Because after a warm bath, the skin is stimulated by warmth, then the many blood vessels in the skin expand at once, and a large amount of blood gathers on the surface of the skin. At the time, the blood distribution of the whole body undergoes a major change. In other words, when the blood vessels of the skin expand, the blood in the internal organs will contract. Therefore, bathing with warm water every day can make the functions of all parts of the body vigorous, increase appetite, and at the same time, the many nerves distributed on the skin have a close relationship with the internal organs. After bathing, because stimulating certain skin nerves can stimulate certain internal organs and increase their activity, that is, enhance the body's resistance and endocrine, as well as red and white blood cells, promote the body's metabolism, and because the blood vessels of the skin expand, the blood circulation in the brain is also good, increasing the nutrition of the brain, the spirit will be calm, the trachea of the skin will not be blocked, and the sweat and fat on the surface of the skin can be removed. This significant physiological phenomenon should be understood clearly.</p>
<h3>The Switch of the Purse</h3>
<h3>Things to Pay Attention to When Doing Beauty</h3>
<p>— (Max Factor)</p>
<p>Almost every woman has to practice beauty, but the method of beauty must be noted, and there are also a few points to be aware of when doing beauty:</p>
<p>㊀ Do not do beauty in front of men. Many men say that women's beauty is unique to them. In other words, it is also their secret, so they cannot publicly break their own secrets in front of men. Logically speaking, when a man sees that a woman's beauty is obtained through beauty products, the impression of the woman's beauty will be fundamentally different.</p>
<p>㊁ Do not do beauty in public places. At banquets or on the street, it is not a place for beauty. It is best to be in a formal beauty salon or washroom.</p>
<p>㊂ Do not borrow other people's beauty products. Borrowing other people's beauty products to do beauty is not only unsanitary, but also enough to make people annoying. In addition, everyone's appearance is different, and the color of the beauty products is matched with each person's appearance, so it will naturally not be suitable for another person to use. Therefore, if every woman practices beauty, she should prepare her own set of beauty products.</p>
<p>㊃ Prepare beauty products for female guests. If you often have female guests visiting your home, it is best to prepare some beauty products for them to use when they accidentally lack beauty products. This is actually some etiquette of the host family, and it is something that a housewife should know.</p>
<h3>Women and Planting Flowers</h3>
<p>— Wu Qiaofang</p>
<p>Flowers are beautiful in shape and bright in color. Women love flowers because their natures are similar.</p>
<p>Therefore, for women who love flowers, understanding the fun of planting flowers can increase the noble style in society and cultivate diligence in the family. The benefits are great and cannot be expressed in words. Europe, America, and Japan have been encouraging home gardening for decades, so women in these countries all have gardening knowledge. Even the application of floral decorations, such as corner flowers for dining tables, flowers for bottle feeding, and the collection and insertion of flowers in baskets, are all well-versed and can be done without asking for help. However, gardening is originally divided into three parts: fruit trees, vegetables, and flowers. Among the three, fruit trees and vegetables may require a large area of land, a lot of labor, abundant capital, or sophisticated technology, or it may take ten years to see the results, or it may require the mobilization of equipment to do it well. Why not flowers, which are the easiest to plant, require little effort, and are effective quickly. And flower beds are set up according to the amount of land, and flower pots are arranged everywhere. Even if it is only a garden of several bows, once planted, it is enough for morning and evening walks and appreciation in all seasons. The advantages are listed in the following four points:</p>
<p>Purifying the air. Generally, plants absorb carbon dioxide during the day and release oxygen at night. If people can make good use of it, their bodies will become healthier day by day. Women are simple and live in seclusion, and the air is easy to feel stale. Planting flowers at home can naturally purify it. Bottle feeding and potted plants are beautiful decorations, which is just extra. This is the hygienic benefit of planting flowers.</p>
<p>Expressing depression. Family affairs cannot always be satisfactory. Women are gentle and often accumulate depression, which is the root of disease. What can you do to relieve your worries if you are unfortunately in adversity from time to time? Only flowers, watching them contain fragrance and spit out beauty, competing for beauty and vying for beauty, as if seeing them, you will feel happy and suddenly eliminate your troubles. Roses contain smiles, and daylilies relieve sorrow. This is the second benefit of planting flowers for nourishing the mind.</p>
<p>Using nature. There are many kinds of plants in nature, and all are beautiful. If they are used properly, they can greatly increase the happiness of the family. For example, among the flowers, Sophora japonica in Jiangnan can eliminate shock and poison, Saxifraga stolonifera can cure injuries widely, roses can be used to make perfume, Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium is a medicine for repelling mosquitoes, fragrant jasmine causes a gentle breeze, and Bianzhu and Peilan quietly eliminate summer heat. There are countless colors and shapes. Only those who plant flowers can enjoy endless medicinal benefits. This is the third benefit of flowers regarding nature.</p>
<p>Verifying science. Since entering school, girls have learned a lot about planting, but due to the lack of teaching materials and incomplete specimens, academic theories are often empty and practical objects cannot be seen. If flowers are cultivated at home, they can be watched at any time, and unique categories can be extended. For example, the characteristics of anemophilous and entomophilous can be distinguished immediately, and the properties of woody and herbaceous plants can be known. By analogy, the physiological functions, organizational outlines, and propagation methods of plants can all be tested in practice, which benefits people's intelligence. Only those who plant flowers can easily receive such effects. This is the fourth benefit of flowers regarding the scientific world.</p>
<p>Others, such as sowing seeds and thinning seedlings, watering and fertilizing, and weeding and removing insects, are done every day, activating all the muscles and bones of the body, practicing labor and service, and being friends with flowers, cultivating aesthetic concepts. Those who are good at painting use it for sketching, and those who can write poetry use it for composing poems. With the help of beautiful flowers, the genius of women is further developed, and the two are beautiful and complementary, adding to each other's brilliance. Every family has a daughter who loves flowers. Women like flowers, and it is appropriate to plant them. In the future, the development of gardening in our country will start here, and family harmony will originate here. If we ask the women, there will be no different opinions. I hope you will take action quickly.</p>
<p>Last spring, the American Women's Association organized a women's gardening tour group (all aristocratic women) to travel around the world to investigate the gardening conditions of various countries. They visited Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and other places. In all the places they visited, only the local governments provided banquets as usual, and no other actions were heard. When they arrived in Japan, in addition to the local government's reception, gardening groups from various places held grand joint celebrations and gave fresh flowers produced in various places every day. It was very active and very enthusiastic. It is said that the tour group had a very good impression in Japan. As a result, after the group returned to their country, they purchased a large number of peonies and other floral gardening plants from Japan. From this, we can see the enthusiasm and interest of the American women's community in gardening research and the Japanese people's skill in doing business. (For information on flower planting materials and methods, you can write to Songxia Gardener of Songyin, Songjiang. You will surely receive a satisfactory answer.)</p>
<h3>Third Letter</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Dai</p>
<p>Ms. B:</p>
<p>In your letter last week, you asked me: "What kind of flowers should I plant in the garden so that there are flowers to enjoy all year round?" This is indeed an interesting question!</p>
<p>Is it probably you yourself who want to plant more flowers and trees in the garden of your house? I have had this experience before. I planted a few flowering trees. Of course, they look good when they bloom, but sometimes there are no flowers to enjoy, and I feel that the garden is too lonely, especially in winter, which is even more boring. So later, when planting flowering trees, I often made their flowering periods connect, so that when flower A finishes blooming, flower B blooms again, and when flower B is about to fall, flower C is budding. Even in winter, there will not be no flowers to enjoy.</p>
<p>However, after studying it now, I realize that there is a problem with it. Having flowers in all seasons is completely unreasonable from the value of the garden. Our country has always called gardens flower gardens, but this statement is also problematic. You must know that most of the trees that bloom are deciduous trees, and very few are evergreen trees. If many flowering trees are planted in the garden, then many deciduous trees will be planted. Spring and summer are certainly lively, but when autumn comes, the leaves fall, and when you look at the garden, you only see many bare branches facing the sky. Isn't this a big eyesore? Therefore, modern gardeners often plant more evergreen trees and fewer deciduous trees, which is a very common formula. Planting more evergreen trees will prevent the sight of desolation in winter. If all evergreen trees are planted, it will be too monotonous, so you must add a few flowering deciduous trees to make it have different scenes in all seasons. The problem is not when there are no flowers to enjoy, but when you cannot even see the leaves, it is a big problem on the garden. Therefore, you must follow this formula. As for how to arrange evergreen trees and deciduous trees and what proportion to use, it depends on the direction, environment, and location of the garden. There cannot be a fixed number.</p>
<p>If people who like to see flowers find it too quiet because there is a time when the flowers are not blooming, there is also a good way to remedy it. You can draw a position in the most prominent place in the garden and make a flower bed. In this flower bed, plant many herbaceous flowers, which is lively. Originally, when looking at flowers, you don't necessarily have to look at woody flowers. Herbaceous flowers also have great appreciation value, and especially the herbaceous flowers planted by foreigners recently are very splendid. The garden really cannot do without them. Ordinary herbaceous flowers are often divided into two types, one for spring and one for autumn.</p>
<p>Then, a flower bed only blooms twice a year in spring and autumn. Isn't there still no flowers to see at other times? There is also a very wonderful way to make it have flowers constantly throughout the year.</p>
<p>It is best to have other open space to plant these herbaceous flowers, and only when they bloom, move these flowers to the flower bed for people to enjoy. At that time, another kind is planted in the open space again. When the flowers in the flower bed are about to wither, they are immediately taken away and replaced with other flowers. In this way, the flowers in the flower bed will never be cut off. Although herbaceous flowers are divided into spring and autumn, if some are planted early and some are planted late, they can also be connected.</p>
<p>With this method, the flowers can be forever continuous. Then the leaves that can permanently decorate the garden will also not be invisible at times. Why don't you try my method!</p>

<p>Supplement to the Shanghai Shen Bao</p>
<p>Talks</p>
<h3>Draining the Pond to Catch All the Fish is Not a Good Method</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai French Concession authorities provoked a strike by all the national pharmacies in the concession because of urging the collection of the "Regulations on the Sale of Chinese Medicines in Retail Stores" tax, and the situation is quite serious. On the one hand, the Public Concession authorities also have a proposal to increase the municipal tax from this year, which has aroused panic among various industries in the concession, and they have sent letters requesting a stop. These two matters are of great importance to all industries. Now I will come out as a third party and say a few words.</p>
<p>The reason for the Public Concession's increase in tax is said to be because of financial exhaustion, so it will implement an increase in tax to help it. As for the reason for the French Concession's collection of new tax, it has not yet been announced, but it is probably no more than a financial problem. It is originally possible to collect new tax or increase tax due to financial exhaustion, but this must be subject to conditions. ㊀ It should be based on the law, ㊁ It should take into account the ability of the counter-taxpayers.</p>
<p>According to the national pharmacies, the authorities' collection of the "Regulations Tax" is not based on the law, but the authorities say that this is implemented according to the Public Works Bureau's method. This point belongs to the legal aspect, and I don't want to say much. As for asking whether the various industries currently have the ability to pay the new tax, I dare to say that they cannot afford it.</p>
<p>The fact is in front of people. The Shanghai market has been declining in recent years due to the impact of the economic panic. This can be seen from the successive bankruptcies of various industries and the flags of store sales. Therefore, now various industries do not say that they are unable to pay the new tax or increased tax. I am afraid that even other taxes have the pain of being unable to bear them. It can be seen that under the current situation, collecting new tax or increasing tax is no different from draining the pond to catch all the fish. No matter how sufficient the reasons held by the authorities are, the method is extremely inappropriate.</p>
<p>As for the French Concession authorities' use of water and electricity cuts to oppress the national pharmacies, it is even more illegal to provoke a strike by all the same industries. Because the issue of collecting the Regulations Tax, even if it must be implemented, must be resolved through proper methods. Cutting off water and electricity is really enough to affect people's business and life. Moreover, since the national pharmacies have no arrears in water and electricity bills, the authorities have no right to cut them off.</p>
<p>Now the Public Concession's proposal to increase tax has not yet been implemented. I hope the authorities will take into account the difficult situation of the various industries and stop it automatically. And the French Concession's urging to collect the new tax has provoked a strike by all the national pharmacies in the concession, and the matter has a dogmatic trend. We hope that both parties will discuss a solution as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Mist</h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>The sky congeals with milky white water vapor, heavy like a lead block pressing on the chest, making breathing urgent. This is the third day of heavy fog.</p>
<p>A tram fresh from the factory lit its electric lamp, the conductor repeatedly ringing the bell to warn pedestrians and vehicles ahead. There were no passengers in the vehicle. The electric lamp seemed like a star in the sky. A blurred black shadow collapsed in the corner of the carriage, probably the ticket seller dozing off? The rickshaw pullers hunched their backs, tucking the rickshaw frame into their waists, staggering along the roadside, slithering along. There was a small food stall there, an oil lamp trembling in the rising fumes, the rickshaw pullers all parked their vehicles here, surrounding the stall to buy snacks; there were also one or two rickshaw pullers casting their sharp eyes, searching for their first customer on the pier and sidewalk—they often left home without a penny, and only bought their breakfast after doing a business.</p>
<p>The street cleaner in the red vest, leaned against the telephone pole, gazing at the distant Huangpu River, where a warship flying the Union Jack was docked. Perhaps this was not his goal, he was reminiscing about his blurred home across the river, where there was an elderly mother or a child being breastfed, waiting for him to earn money to buy winter clothes! He was lost in thought, his fingers, stiff with cold, stuck in the pocket of his vest, standing still, the broom like an abandoned woman, lying at his feet.</p>
<p>In the congealed air, the bell rang again. Now it was not the bell on the tram, the street cleaner's hearing was still very sharp, he knew that his companion had already led the garbage donkey cart from across the street. He immediately warmed his fingers with his breath, grabbed the broom from the ground, as if someone was about to snatch it from him, diligently sweeping in the middle of the street, and by the time he could see clearly the face of the person leading the donkey cart, a high pile of garbage had already accumulated next to the telephone pole.</p>
<p>They nodded in greeting, the one pulling the donkey cart searched out two crumpled cigarette butts from his pocket, they lit them in the direction of the windbreak, and as two streams of thick smoke mixed into the fog layer, they talked in low voices about some irrelevant things, almost forgetting that their work was not yet finished, while the donkey was shaking the copper bell on its neck to warn them.</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller who had just been pulling an empty cart had done business and returned, and brought another guest, who was obviously catching the first liner to the inland rivers. Although the clock on the Jianghai Customs could not be seen, the sailors on the liner had not neglected their duty and had already sounded the second echo.</p>
<p>People had gathered from who knows when and where, crowding on the pier, where a true picture of life was on display: there were sons seeing their fathers home, and wives reluctant to part with their newly married husbands, those who had made a fortune were indeed smiling, dreaming of returning home, and those who had borrowed a final sum from relatives and friends in their hometown were perhaps cursing Shanghai for not having room for them!</p>
<p>The ruthless liner sounded its third echo, separating joys and sorrows on the pier, bravely breaking through the thick fog layer and heading towards the center of the river, the hearts left on the pier hanging in the air. As the ship's shadow gradually sank into the milky white air, they turned around, and the rickshaw pullers surrounded them like a swarm of bees.</p>
<p>The thick fog gradually thinned, and chaos and haste revealed the original shape of the city.</p>
<p>A group of urchins curled up in the corner of the wall of a warehouse, covering their bodies with newspapers, they had fortunately survived another winter night!</p>
<p>But, "Three days of heavy fog bring west winds," perhaps heaven is brewing a "lucky snow" for the wealthy to celebrate the New Year!</p>
<h3>Historical Materials on the "Number One Dish in the World"</h3>
<p>— Fan Gen</p>
<p>Recently, major newspapers across the country have carried many news reports about the "Number One Dish in the World" invented by Chairman Chen of Jiangsu Province. Because the author is acquainted with Mr. Chen, I met with him a few days ago, inquired about the details, and quickly recorded the general outline for the readers.</p>
<p>The "Number One Dish in the World" is made of shrimp meat, chicken soup, tomatoes, and pot rice (some newspapers mistakenly wrote "tomatoes" as "chilies"). It was not originally invented by Mr. Chen, but he discovered its advantages, improved it, and gave it its name. It happened in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China when Mr. Chen went to Hangzhou. He was dining at a small restaurant and found this dish. However, it was not yet the combination of the four ingredients. Mr. Chen saw its bright color, the crispness of the pot rice, the delicious taste, and the pleasant sound of the pot rice entering the soup, with a fragrant aroma. He thought it was a good dish with sound, aroma, color, and taste, and its price was only a few cents, so he often remembered it when eating. A friend invited him to a banquet at Jufeng Garden, and Mr. Chen proposed using this dish instead of shark fin. Usually, shark fin is used as the main dish in banquets to show respect to guests. However, shark fin is expensive, mostly foreign goods, and only tastes thick and greasy, not as delicious as this dish. Afterwards, Mr. Chen often promoted the benefits of this dish to his friends, but he had not yet given it a name. Mr. Chen had a cousin studying in Belgium who was not used to foreign food and cooked her own meals. Mr. Chen wrote to her telling her how to make this dish, its various advantages, and said that if it was prepared well, it could be called the best dish in the world. His cousin followed the method and was very satisfied, telling her foreign friends about it. Everyone was surprised by its four perfections, and they all competed to make it. Thus, this dish was introduced to foreign countries at that time. Later, after Mr. Chen took charge of Jiangsu Province, the Jiangsu Goods Exhibition closed. A grand banquet was held for the guests, and he ordered the chef to make pure Jiangsu dishes to entertain them, in line with the meaning of Jiangsu goods. The dishes were complete, which can be said to be a culmination of Jiangsu cuisine. At the same time, this dish was also included, and it was determined that the ingredients would be shrimp meat, chicken soup, tomatoes, and pot rice, without adding other ingredients, and its name was set as "Number One Dish in the World." Many people thought that the "Number One Dish in the World" and "Jiangsu Cuisine" were born at the same time, but this dish already had a history of several years. The news reports in the newspapers recently are actually old news.</p>
<p>After that, Mr. Chen always prepared this dish for banquets, so most of those who had attended Mr. Chen's banquets had tasted it. At the end of the year, he personally wrote a eulogy, pointing out the advantages of this dish and adding many sentences that encourage ambition based on the ingredients. The wording was grand, and the eulogy said: "This is called the Number One Dish in the World, with color, sound, aroma, and taste all complete. Banquets are not only for the benefit of the mouth, but also for the eyes, ears, and nose. This dish is nourishing and not expensive, and can replace swallow's nest or shark fin. Tomatoes, pot rice, chicken, and shrimp are not only delicious but also good for the stomach. Dry and wet, moving and still, Chinese and foreign, land and sea ingredients are gathered together. Be brave to fight the enemy and be able to yield and stretch. Ambition can be inspired by things. I solemnly promote it today, hoping to enjoy it with every meal." For the sake of popularization, he printed the eulogy on small pieces of paper and distributed them to the guests at the New Year's Day banquet this year. A reporter from the local newspaper obtained it and published it in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Recently, Zhenjiang people have boasted that there are three things in Zhenjiang that are the best in the world: one is the best river and mountain in the world, in Beigushan, inscribed by Yan Lu Wu Ju; one is the best spring in the world, near Jinshan Temple, which seems to be inscribed by Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty; and the other is Chairman Chen's Number One Dish in the World.</p>

<h3>"Smuggling" and "Our Hometown"</h3>
<p>Premiering at the Penglai Grand Theater</p>
<p>"Smuggling" and "Our Hometown", performed by the Torch Drama Society, are scheduled to premiere today at the Penglai Grand Theater across from the Penglai Market in Nanshi.</p>
<p>The cast is extraordinarily solid, including Xia Xia, Qian Feng, He Bin, Ding Ning, Ma Hu, Zhao Shan, Zhang Hong, Zhang Yi, Wang Di, and Huang He. In addition to Xia Xia's excellent acting skills being recognized by all sectors, the others are all key members of the Shanghai Theater, Suzhou Film Studio, Jinan Film Company, and Haiyan Drama Society, and have been engaged in theatrical work for many years. With the serious direction of Mr. Ling He and Mr. Liu Liu, the performance effect must be good. However, the society is not complacent about this, and plans to hold a trial performance this afternoon to invite the press and theater circles to give guidance and assistance.</p>
<h3>Cathay Screens "Commoner Emperor"</h3>
<p>George Arliss's New Work</p>
<p>Silver Screen Jester George Arliss has been away from Shanghai for a long time. Now his work "The Commoner Emperor" (The King's Vacation) is scheduled to open today at the Cathay Grand Theater, which is not a good news for the film industry. George Arliss plays a king with a peculiar personality in the film. Because the life of the emperor is too restrictive, every move cannot be free. When a revolution breaks out in the country, he actually rises up and joins hands with the revolutionaries, preferring to abandon the throne. The plot is satirical and the performance is humorous. Arliss's acting skills are, of course, transcendent and need no further comment. In addition to Arliss, there are also big stars such as Dick Powell, Mrs. Arliss, and Patricia Ellis co-starring, which adds a lot to the film.</p>
<h3>About Amateur Actors</h3>
<p>The third major performance of amateur actors has been decided to be staged at the Carlton Theater in the city starting on the 24th of this month. The programs include three plays, "Demon of Desire", "Thunderstorm", and "Living in a Dream", all of which are world famous works. The definite news is: two theaters in Nanjing have contacted the Actor Association to negotiate the matter of going to Nanjing to perform over the years. The amateur has sent people to make contact and carry out the matter, and plans to re-stage "Nora" and "The Government Inspector" together. The picture above is Wang Weiyi's makeup in "Demon of Desire".</p>
