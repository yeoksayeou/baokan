<h3>德法軍備擴充的白熱化（一）</h3>
<p>— 孝可</p>
<p>自從一九三三年一月三十日，希特勒挟着國社黨的聲威，掌握了德國政權之後，德國即一步步的廢棄凡爾賽不平等條約，而恢復軍備。直到了去年的三月七日，德國又破壞洛加諾公約，進軍萊茵河非武裝區域。以致法國不得不動員軍隊，進駐馬齊諾戰线地道內，日夜防守。講到這條馬齊諾戰线，深約五＋米，內部設備完全機械化。据说遠望如無物，敵軍一到近前，就有機關槍砲從地中鑽出，在防範的嚴密上說來，真是鳥兒也飛不過來，並非過譽的了。一般德國軍事專家的議論，認為下次大戰，利在紳速，不宣而戰，短時內毁滅敵人的一切，然後可佔勝利。無怪法國在萊茵河邊的防守，格外戰戰兢兢，務求萬分嚴密。現在馬齊諾戰线除經常驻軍外，又恐戰事一旦發生，一時不及補充，特將附近鄉村的壯健居民，每星期一概集中戰线內，熟練機械的使用方法，以及軍械貯藏的場所等等，使臨時不致慌忙遲誤。法國軍事當局為增加戰時動員的速效起見，更將後備軍的一切服裝槍械，預藏指定地點，一俟戰事發生時，更不必先赴營房集中，進備一切，可以免除時間上的損失，祇須逕赴指定地點矣。</p>
<p>歐洲方面的國際關係，自希特勒擴充軍備，積極破壞各種國際絛約以後，本已萬分緊張，而所謂新洛加諾公約的締結，早宣傳於國際間，但因歐洲政局的變化，德意因奧國問題的解决，互相接近，對外交方针，表面上似超一致，藉以要挟英法，更因西班牙內戰發生，法相斯武力澎湃，致新洛加諾會议屡次延期，至今已遥遥無期矣。</p>
<p>殊不知國際間一波未平，一波又起，希特勒每在其Borcbtes　gaden鎮別墅閒居，對阿爾卑斯山積雪靜坐默思的時候，正在考慮着他那震驚世界的計劃，這就是在去年八月二十六日宣佈將義務軍役期自一年延長至二年。其結果，德國常備軍額，自去年十月起，至少要超過一百二十萬人。（軍役未延畏前，約為八十萬人，就中一九一四年級兵士為四十五萬人，另外的三十五萬則為職業兵，一九三五年級為大戰時生軍額最缺的第一年，然尚有三十至四十萬人，同時受軍事訓練的警察二十至二十五萬人，總計可達一百五十萬人。）德國延畏軍役期限，基威脅法國的嚴重性，自不待言，蓋法國在本部的常備軍額，祇四＋萬人，（內職業兵八萬人）去春法政府亦因一九一五年級義務軍士的缺逕之故，會向議會請求暫將軍役期延長至兩年，以維持常備軍的數額。故自德國擴充軍備的消思傳出後，法總理萊翁勃倫與國防部長達賴第即召集參謀本部，開聯席會議，籌議對策。結果祗有兩種辦法，可以對付德國武力的威脅，第一種：延長軍役至二年半或三年，此種辦法，財認為需費不資，且為人民所不滿，無實行可能性。第二種辦法：從軍械方面加以强度的機械化，故議决從軍械的質量與數量方面，兩方增進其效能。</p>

<h3>外交政策之一貫性</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>當佐藤新外相在東京舉行親任式的同一天國民政府根據中央政治會議之決議。發表于龍惠博士為外交部長。中日兩國。同時有新的外交長官。在中日國交已成為今世界注意力。集中的現在。對于中日兩國今後外交政策之變化。自然會引起種種揣測與設想。然而人物的上台下台。同一國之基本外交政策。關係不大。于龍惠博士在四日曾發表談话。謂今後外交方针。當本中央已定之政策。及五全大會以後中樞歷次所宣示之原則。繼續邁進。而佐藤在議院內宣布。謂一國外交方針。不應頻繁變更。而有保持幾分繼續性之必要。我們相信一種外交政策。是基于本國的需要與國際的環境二因素的。這兩個因素如果沒有變動。主持外交者人選之更迭。影響是十分微細的。</p>
<p>中國政府對于外交權之行使。數年以來。已漸漸地形成一種固定的制度。中國民黨的對外政策。經過孫中山先生及黨國諸領袖的闡揚與歷届黨的最高會議之宣佈。已有一定之途徑。尤其是月前舉行的三中全會。對于中日外交應取之方針。已有正確之决定。而这種决定。中國人民。表示着深切之同情。外交部长。其職責為處理國際交涉及關于在外僑民•居留外人•中外商業等一切事務。而外交政策之最後决定權。在于中國國民黨。因為現行訓政約法規定。中央統治權。由中國國民黨代行之。所以國民黨的中央政治會議。實為决定外交政策与监督外交行政的最高权關。這個機關。本身封中央執行委員會負責。而國民政府又對中央政治會議負責外交部只是國民政府的分支而已。</p>
<p>而且國民政府的各部分對于外交政策的執行。也負着監督與控制之责任。就行政院而論。外交部長直接對院長負責部長只是院長之属员而已。現在院長沒有更迭。當然谈不到外交政策之變動。其次。立法院對于外交權。亦有相當之控制。據國府組織法之規定。宣戰講和及其他重要國際事項。决定之权。在于立法院。一切國際協定及條约。属于立注範圍者。非經立法院議决公佈。则立法院有提出質询之責。至于監察院對于外交權之監督。更属明顯。因為監察院是最高監察機關。外交部長如有違法或失職之事。當然可以提出彈劾。在二十一年外交部簽訂中日上海停戰協定時。外交部長曾受監察院之彈劾即其明例。</p>
<p>所以外交部長之變動。同外交政策之方針。沒有很大的關係。我們希望政府保持外交之一貫性。我們希望新的外交部長本着民族自存與國際平等之宗旨。運用時會。向前努力。</p>

<p>（巴黎）國務總理白倫今晚發表無綫電廣播演說、說明日昨政府所採金融措置之意義、並籲請全國人民踴躍輸將、以認購國防公債、茲摘錄演詞大要如下總理首稱法國及外國人士、形容法國財政狀況雖遇於黯淡、然此層實有加以認眞注意之必要、今若採取治標之法、頭痛醫頭、脚痛醫脚、则流弊甚多、是必正本清源為一勞永逸之計而後可、此次政府所採取之金融措置、其目的即在於此、抑法国財政困難、其主要原因、不出二端、一则由於經濟恐慌也、二則由於國際局勢之緊張也、政府所擬之辦法、要在以有效手段、解除此兩種困難、使經濟狀况、日見改善、庶幾財政有昭蘇之望、夫法國經濟復興、已見端倪、而財政復興、獨為濡緩、此原不足為怪、論者不察、乃以為法國財政狀況、已瀕危殆、深慮政府採取過激性質之措置、如再度貶低幣值、或管理外匯之類、甚且對於國庫能否應付所負債務、亦表示懷疑、人民對於政府財政既缺乏信心、結果所届、資金為之外流、而外匯投機、亦復成為風氣、由此可見財政困难、直接足以影響貨幣之稳定、此政府為治本之計、所由必就財政狀况、與貨幣狀況兼籌並顧也、</p>
<p>就法國財政況而論、儘足以應付所務之債務、而不虞竭蹶、查國庫虧欠總額約為三百六十萬萬佛郎、益以英國借欵四十萬萬佛郎、（即倫教十二家貸與法國各鐵路公司之欵計四千萬鎊、折合佛郎約如上數）則總計為四百萬萬佛部、但自本年一月以來、政府已籌還八十萬萬佛郎、所餘虧負之數、不過三百二十萬萬佛郎、政府現已决定節减各項臨時支出六十萬萬佛郎、尚虧二百六十萬萬法郎、此數一部份係由鐵路虧耗所致、此項虧耗、以後當可逐漸減少、職是之故、即就稅牧情形最惡劣之時期計之、虧空之數、亦不致超過政府歲入之總額、且最後所餘虧空之數（二百六十萬萬佛郎）、其中百份之五十、係供國防經費之臨時支出、因此政府决定發行大批國防公債以資挹注、此項公债、將於日內開始發行、其票面分作佛郎美元英鎊三種、即代表英美法貸幣協定三簽字國之貨幣、以故此項公债之持券人、可獲有保障、即使英法美三國互相匯價、互有漲落、亦有無損失之虞、抑法國人士以資金輸出國外者、無非欲避免佛郎跌價之危險、今國防公債票面、分作佛郎美元英鎊三種任人選購、是則對於貨幣貶值之危險、無論在目前與在將來、均有所保障、彼在國外存有資金者、自不能再有所藉口而拒購公債矣、職是之故、政府期望國防公債發行之後、大批輸出資金、可重復歸回本國、若然則匯兌市場、當一變其原來之情形、為達到此項目的起見、政府玆將决定、嗣後黃金輸入及買賣、均得自由行之、（按以前人民在国内或国外貯有現金者、概須呈報政府、而由政府就其因佛郎貶值後所增高之價值、加以提取此項辦法、以後即將取銷故云、）此外白倫總理復再三聲明政府决定信守英法美三國貨幣協定、且各項强制性質之措置、如管理外匯制度等均當避免採取云、</p>

<p>（紐約）此間銀行界今日對於財部已與法國成立諒解、准許美國人民購買法國國防債券之說、頗為懷疑、惟稱瓊森法僅禁止愆付美債之國家在美國發行債券云、（六日國民電）</p>

<h3>旅歐隨筆（續）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐記者　列山</p>
<p>西班牙本來是個軍備落後的國家，可是此次內戰，大砲坦克車，飛機等等新式軍械應有盡有•一方面固然由於變方帮忙的人慷慨，不吝供给•另一面帮忙的人却也想乘這個機會將自己的軍械實地試騐一下，到底夠不夠精良•記得當佛蘭戈蔣軍方面由德國運到許多最新式高射砲以後，曾擊落好幾架俄法製造的飛機•一位德國熟人對記者說：“你瞧，德國的機會究竟是行的•我們的軍械比法俄等國的高明”•過了幾天，佛蘭戈方面德意產的飛機在馬德里前綫也被對方俄國製造的高射砲射落了好幾架•於是我開了這位熟人的玩笑，問他承認不承認，俄國的軍械也不錯、他不醫了•</p>
<p>雖說上次歐戰結果後到了現在不到二十年，但在這短期內歐洲各國的軍械造製已有驚人的進步•尤其是飛機並高射砲，坦克車並射坦克砲•這批新式軍械，無疑的，在未來戰爭中要佔一個最主要的地位•此日各國雖擁有不少這種利器，但還沒有經過一種實地試騐，成績到底如何，只有理論上的答案•恰因為這個緣故，歐洲各國都想把西班牙的內戰當做他們一個良好的試騐所•並且事實上，他們的確也是如此幹的</p>
<p>幾星期前，法國國會中一位議員質問航空部部長戈特，為什么在西班牙內戰中法國製造的飛機失事來得特別多•當時戈特先生答復：大部分失事的飛楊都是舊式的•至於新式的法國飛機却很可靠•戈特先生這種說法無異承認法國飛機曾參加了西班牙內戰•同樣的，英國上院中某次一議員質問英國航空當局，為什麼英國不派空軍武官隨員到馬德里去•據這位議員的意見，在馬德里前綫正在試騐着各国最新式的武器，尤其是空军•英國應该注意這類新式軍械的發展•後來英國果然派了一位空軍武官隨員到西班牙去。</p>
<p>倘若各國這樣再試騐下去，大約這一塲內戰還要經過相當的時日•所苦的只有西班牙人民•</p>
<p>二十一•西班牙內戰與志願軍間題</p>
<p>一般說來，在西班牙內戰中最使人家失望的，無過於西班牙兵士戰鬥力的薄弱•為的西班牙人缺乏作戰的能力，不會運用新式軍械，於是乎帮忙的人自己先焦急起来，由此才产生了志願军問题•德意两国除了派送大批空军人员以外，聽說新近還有正式軍隊便裝運赴西班牙，加入佛蘭戈將軍方面作戰•同樣的，各國的社會主義者也接連地跑到西班牙去帮助“人民陣线”政府•左派的报紙讚揚這批人是替社會主義奪鬥的勇士•右派的報紙却說他們是“砲灰”•不過雙方所公認的一點：就是此次死守馬德里是這批國際志願軍的功勞•</p>
<p>說起此次參加西班牙內戰的各國志願軍，情形却有分別•站在彿蘭戈將軍方面的德意法西斯蒂黨人大半都受過了軍事訓練，實力較强，相反的，“人民阵线”政府方面的志願軍•除了法俄一部分軍事專家或下級軍官以外，都只是普通的各國共產黨人並社會黨人•這一批人還是“烏合之衆”•雖說有為主義而犧牲的精神，但沒有戰爭的經騐•結果作戰時只善於防禦戰，一談到進攻戰鬥力就不及了•這我們月來在馬德里前綫的載爭情形中很可以看出•於是乎令人想起，像這樣的國際軍，就再多募集一批送到西班牙去，能否保證“人民陣綫”政府獲得最後的勝利•似乎還是一個疑由•</p>
<p>單靠本身的力量，或者以國際軍主體，“人民陣綫”政府在相當的時間內恐怕還沒有解决西班牙内戰的可能•假如法俄两国肯以正式军隊開入西班牙帮助作戰，那末亂事一二個月以內就可以平息•難然，這種舉動定會引起德意的反感，結果有引起世界大戰的危險•英法兩國的希望，就是把西班牙事件變成了地方事件，不至於連累及歐洲全體•於是乎新近歐洲各國才有禁止志願軍前赴西班牙的問題•不用說，這對於“人民陣綫”政府是一種打擊•</p>
<p>據一位有軍事常識的某君看法，除了法俄國家軍隊以外，只有中國的紅軍有能力帮助“人民陣线”政府解决內亂•倘若這数萬红军開到西班牙去，不出一個月，一定會產生另外一種局面•這也許對於大家都有好處”•他說：“在共產黨人看來，革命反正是世界性的，無論在中國或者在西班牙都是一樣•在我們中國人看來，這一來最少暫時可以避免掉在中國境內中國人去打中國人……</p>
<h3>粵金融波動之一瞥</h3>

<h3>⊙肺癆病家庭之大危險</h3>
<p>共食制與肺癆　中國當代大醫學家余雲岫先生述</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>共食之制，中國到處有之，南方尤甚，方丈一案，圍坐七八人，餚饌雜陳，盃箸交錯，家人父子，和氣團聚，賓朋主客，醉飽俱至，非不煦煦然親暱而周至，然者疾病傳染之鳩媒，即在乎此，其冒犯危險，與蹈白刅赴湯火，無以異也，聞者疑吾言乎，請舉肺癆以為說，肺癆之為病也，雖醫學發達如今日，苟病勢用進者，幾不能保其必愈，經診定則生死莫卜，此固人人所聞之而色變，避之惟恐不速者也，然而蔓延日廣，搵者日衆，畏之而不能免，避之而無所逃，豈真有死生之命，懸於天哉，亦其知識不足，習尚未善，而防之不得其道也</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>夫肺癆之為病，為由細菌傳染而成，德國考克博士發明肺癆菌以來四十餘年矣世界學者，舉無異議，千古神奸，豁然呈露，方之禹鼎，功不在下，至於今日，婦孺皆知，情債者獨我舊俗耳，其為菌也，長不及萬分珊知米突之十五，闊不及萬分㻿知米突之五，以千倍顯微鏡窺之，僅如短髭，無足不能以行也，無尾不能以遊也，無羽属不能以飛翔也，俗謂痨瘵由處捐而成，又謂肺蟲靈物，病人將死，飛遁而出、傳附他人者妄也，而紫庭追癆方，且關其六代之形，王肯堂證治準繩採之，要皆彷彿相像辭，四庫提要所以語怪之譏也。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>肺癆菌之人於肺中也，發育生長，繁殖醜類，故肺癆病人，咳唾之痰，多有此菌雜居其中，甚者一微塵痰沫，包涵癆菌之數，多至數千百頭，此以顯微鏡撿之，歷歷可數，非空言恫脅也，準此而推？一口之痰，其中癆菌之微，何止幾億萬頭，以包藏幾億萬頭癆菌之痰，由肺中而唾諸外界，必經喉舌沾唇菌而後出，然則包藏癆菌之痰沫，其污染於病人喉舌唇鹵間者，不知有幾微塵，而痰中癆菌之蟻附於病人喉舌唇菌間者，為數之多，何堪設想，盃箸之屬，一經肺癆病人之口之接觸，被其包涵癆菌之痰所污染者，不知有幾微塵，而痰中癆菌之僕緣於盃箸問者，為數之多，何堪設想，席上餚饌，一般病人下箸，其包涵癆菌之痰沫，足以污染餚饌者，不知有幾微壓，而痰中癆菌，緣附浮游於餚饌中者，為數之多，又何堪設想，同席之人，貿然不察，而用其盃箸，而食其唾餘，是呑癆菌也。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>嗟呼，患肺癆者，而為賓客奇食之人，則一二次之共食，或可幸免於傳染若為家人父字同居共業之人朝夕與處，每飯必共，是日二三餐，取癆菌而吞之也，欲求其不傳染，豈可得乎，故吾曰其冒犯危險，與蹈白刅赴湯火，無以異也，其偶有不被傳染者，或有特別之體質關係，直幸而免耳，易足恃乎，雖肺癆之傳染，多在於呼吸之氣，而入口之飲食，亦取禍之道也，然則共食之制，乃日取肺癆細菌，以壓無病者之制也，豈非陋習，豈非知命者所宜悚然知戒，豈非仁人君子，所當大聲疾呼而痛革之哉，中國肺癆病之多，實堪驚愕，蕩蕩洪水，不知汎濫之所極，亦亡國弱種之源也，有心世道者，亦於習俗改良之點，知所措意乎，（此文由余氏醫述轉載）</p>
<h3>肺癆病最新醫療法</h3>
<p>蓋肺結核（即肺癆）之原因是結核菌，而此菌一入人體內，則於該處，便成結節，以斷血行之路，又結核能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質，包園其體以防禦一切外來药力之侵入，故雖用種種殺菌藥，內服或注射，終不能達其病菌之實體內，歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法，對症療法，理舉的療法，血清療法，藥劑療法，及其他一切治療法等，尚未完全成功，而肺病無藥之說，遍滿於一世者，因未知此深奧學理故耳，由此現代結核學者，根據上述之學理，繼續研究，不遣餘力，結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑，名曰三那星Sanosin此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脫蠟術發明家德國柏格爾搏士之最新醫理而發明成功者，據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實驗報告，此藥有滲透肺病籠之結節及溶解體質之作用，兼具有殺菌力，能根治一二三期之肺癆，確有萬試萬盡之特效，在中國，業經國民政府中央衛生試驗所化驗藥性和平無毒，絕無任何副作用，茲略舉醫治作用於下。</p>
<p>（一）設於試驗管中，實驗“三那星”之藥力作用，則一分鐘後，結核菌皆消失其抗酸性，至三分鐘後，則此肺結核菌，完全殺盡，無一倖免。</p>
<p>（二）依動物試驗，則發見“三那星”能滲入結核病體內，設檢查其病籠內潛伏之　　結核菌，則盡失其抗酸性，此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣。</p>
<p>（三）如患者內服“三那星”一星期左右，則立見咯痰稀釋，體熱下降等良好狀態。</p>
<p>（四）更繼續內服“三那星”達三十天至六十天以上，則顯見體重增加，食慾激進，一切症狀，逐漸緩和，終達其囘天再造之偉功。</p>
<p>奉送三那星實驗報告書及肺病療養指導書函索即寄</p>

<h3>一萬公尺競走周如泉保持冠軍</h3>
<p>成績一時五十分卅五秒二　謝行導仍因姿勢不合取銷　表演組冠軍為談榮生</p>
<p>本市社會局主辦之第三届二萬公尺競走、於昨日上午九時在市中必區舉行、結果表演組談勞生以一時四十八分十七秒獲冠軍、公開組周如泉以一時五十分三十五秒二保持冠軍、謝行導雖先抵終點、惜仍以姿勢不合取銷資格、茲分誌如次、</p>
<p>起步情形</p>
<p>昨日上午九時復旦大學門前裁判員、童子軍、運動員均絡續抵達、雖天陰稍寒、但精神極佳、本届因有聾啞四人、老者二人參加、益增觀者與趣、八時五十分點卯、實到數五十一人、臨時缺席者有朱榮祥•陳叔倫•蔡仁良•沈祖樂•許運生•等五人、九時正槍聲起處、一五零二條飛毛腿向翔殷路蜂踴而前、一時難見先後、五百米後、謝行導•周如泉•邱德昌等始行先導、談榮生緊緊跟隨、而王漁仁鄭成山輩則洛後二十餘米、</p>
<p>中途競爭</p>
<p>在此二萬公尺之長距離中、大有路迢迢難達終點之慨、惟謝行導與周如泉則始終相近、或前或後、不即不離、邱德昌在最初一千公尺中曾一路前導、但至控江路以後即一蹶不振、至馬玉山路時周先於謝、軍工路電廠時謝先於周、水電廠時又周先於謝、最後則仍謝先於周、惟相距最多不過白公尺之譜、談榮生自控江路以後始終保待第三位、而至水電廠時忽怒馬狂奔、躍過周謝而居首魁、鄭成山則中途抽筋脫陣，王涇仁始終在五六位之間餘子或先或後變化甚多、而衆目暌睽之林吉姆、不幸以長力不繼、中途脫陣、</p>
<p>到達終點</p>
<p>十時三刻許談榮生一馬報到、掌聲不絕、其後百公尺許為謝行導、又十公尺為周如泉•徐藹臣．王涇仁到達時離周已五百公尺之遙、而徐國福•樂阿才等則幾有千餘公尺之鉅、此後次序為楊俊•崔偉民•吳潤昌•唐文儀•沈靜生•邱德昌•施炳桂•朱世英•陳春耕等、至十一時三刻始全部到達、檢點數目則為四十四人、老人吳水福處三十六名、葛精康四十一名、聾啞錢家璋二十九名、李文彬四十二名、</p>
<p>錄取名次</p>
<p>經檢察裁判集議結果、除去犯規者取消省格外、發表正式名次如次、表演第一談榮生成績一時四十八分十七秒、第二王涇仁一時五十五分十七秒四、公開組第一周如泉成績一時五十分三十五秒二、第二徐藹臣一時五十五分十七秒、第三徐國幅一時五十七分二十八秒四、第四楊俊︼時五十八分十五秒第五唐文儀•第六沈靜生、第七邱德昌、第八施炳桂、第九朱世英、第十陳春耕，</p>
<p>取銷資格</p>
<p>昨日因犯規而被取消資格者甚多、但最為可惜者乃謝行導一人、謝以一時五十分二十二秒四抵達終點、結果因姿勢不合、不能予以錄取、查謝君於上届变曾獲第一而受取消資格之處分、那時因裁判員全係中華競走會中聘請、仍恐受人懷疑包辦、故本届向各方聘請、且有來自北平、對運動員無一認識者、故謝君之姿勢不合、已成鐵則據集裁判云、謝君之姿勢、須根本訓練矯正後庶可參加云、寄語謝君勝敗小事、倘能矯正姿勢、勤加練習、仍為可造之才、倘以此而氣餒、且生怨心、則前途已無希望、而昨日當裁判宣佈取消後之大肆叫囂、殊非正當行為、又中華盡局汽車、時在謝之前後亂穿、亦非規律所許、且因阻碍裁判視线、有促成謝君犯規之機會、尚望注意及之、</p>
<p>當塲給獎</p>
<p>賽畢、於十二時在市府階前給獎、到社會局張科長、市黨部喻仲標•名譽總幹事馬崇淦•總裁判邵汝幹•總幹事王克永等、由袁增煜司儀、行禮如儀、首由張科長致詞、略謂本届因路程較上届增加一倍、故參加人數較少、但精神甚好、希望努力練習、下届能增至五萬公尺之目標云、次由市黨部喻仲標致詞、總裁判邵汝幹報告、末給獎、第一名得吳市長盾、潘局長杯、吳市長旗、第二名得吳市長盾•及旗、潘局長盾、第三各同、第四名得吳市長旗、潘局長盾、第五名同、第六至第十名各得潘局長盾、此外凡跑畢全程者均發獎牌一枚、開此次獎品均由標地運動器具公司承製、式樣頗為美觀云、</p>

<h3>中學畢業會考問題</h3>
<p>— 應</p>
<p>㊃</p>
<p>然則會考已無甚嚴重之流弊乎、是不然、上文所引前此京市小學因會考加重功課情形、恐全國中學至今猶蹈其弊、縱會考科目業已减少、各校仍不免對會考科目之教學時數額外增加何者、中史中地物理等科、其學程均已於二年級修學外史外地算學化學等科、雖延至最後一學期始畢、但大部分或一部分學程亦早屬過去、此過去之學科與學程非經一番複習、曷易待言應考、而況成績低劣學校、自問過去教學疏忽、不複習直無以應試、成績優良者亦自覺非複習雖以角優勝、於是青年這學習担負驟增、其健康之受損害、何待測量體重而後知、或詛救正之道、會考科目及其學程分量可逕以最後一學期者為限、不必溯及其前、此為會考計誠得矣、其如畢業後尚有升學考試之必須考試全部學程者何、且畢業考試尚以畢業程度為範圍、升學考試有竟超越畢業程度者、其雖實還在會考問題之上、如果升學考試與畢業會考不能溝通併合、則能免於會考者不能免於升學考試、又何責此暫免而總集困難於其後乎、如幸能併合為一矣、則其所考又必將為全部學程而斷無僅考最後階段之範圍之理、此會考科目及其學程內容似暫無變更之必要、為今之計與其聽令各校仍擅自增加時數複習過去學程、不如明令各校最後一學期得於課外規定每週三至五小時之復習時數、酌量分配於會考各枓、仍由各科教員切實指導、此外不得於課內外再行增加任何教學時數、庶事實需要與學習担負均能顾及、此外尚有一事、即会考及格成績之發表、歷來似均採取獎歷主義、每生各科成績均依分數揭示、今會考之制既經確立、不虞復有阻碍、似無取於揭示分數辦法、可僅依及格與否分別發表、僅亦减少其刺激性而維護青年心理衛生之一端歟、筆者非絕對擁護會考制也、惟在以考試為考查學業成績方法之原則未能根本改革以前、認為會考並不比學校所舉行之嚴格考試為更有害、而反較為有利、第因會考所引起一時緊張之空氣與學校之不當措施、影響確甚嚴重、同時與會考時間密接之升學考試、在理論上其重複既不可通、在事實上後者之困難超越前者數倍、遂使論者觀察不明、論點混淆、詬病會考、詛為虐政、平情論之、會考制度寗能負其費乎、我人為愛護青年並愛護青年之學業計、敢要求實際辦學者切實反省、平時對各科教學切實依據標準、認𠤤考查學業成績、養成學生努力學習慣於考試之風習、同時要求教育行政機關對於各校之濫增教學時數集中於會考科目、停頓非會考科目之教學、隨時查察糾正、最後更要求教育行政當局與各大學對大學之入學考試與高中畢業會考謀一溝通之道、並力求其考試之合理化、庶幾會考制度之內在的與外鑠的困難可减至最低限度、而整齊學業程度提高教學效率之實效可以大彰、區區之意願與教會界同人商榷之、（完）</p>

<h3>所得稅施行後工商界應注意三事</h3>
<p>李文杰在市民會演講　可供工商界重要參考</p>
<p>新聲社云、李文杰會計師、於前日在第一特區市民聯合會•講演“所得稅法施行後工商界在會計上應當注意之事項•”對所得稅各項實際問題、有極透徹具體之分析、為目前工商界重要參考資料、特亟錄如下、所得稅與會計的關係的重要、是極明顯的事、我國所得稅法規、現已開始施行了、工商界對於此一問題、已經引起了深切的注意、今天兄弟拿所得稅暫行條例及其施行細則與三類征收須知草案的規定做骨幹、把與有關係的會計上應注意的事項和問題、摘要加以討論現在所說的會計、當然是工商業會計、並且包括簿記的技術在內、茲分（甲）當前應當準備的事項、（乙）平時應加注意的事項、及（丙）决算時應加注意的事項三點、分別说明之、</p>
<p>（甲）當前應當準備的事項</p>
<p>㊀改良不完備的簿記、設立統一正確的會計制度、我國各地工廠商號、大多數是獨資經營、或合夥組織、規模率皆狹小、“信實通商”“以義為利、”是歷來的善良習慣、資本主與經理職員間、廠店與顧客間、任何重大事項、往往一貫為定、形式不必具備、因之對於簿記一項、平時多不注意、不完備的缺點自然不能避免、現在因為要繳納所得稅、必須有正確的簿記、方才可以結出正確的損益提出可靠的證明文件在納稅的時候、就可以免除不少的困難和糾紛、所以改良不完備的簿記、設立統一正確的會計制度、是當前應當立即準備的事項、設立一種統一正確的會計制度、要以每一行業的業務狀况固有習慣、和經營情形做對象、不是可以概括敘述的事、現在僅能摘述其具有共通性的要點於後、一•帳簿的名稱•種類．和作用、應當確一規定、二•記帳和决算的方法、應當集議規定、共同遵守、三•記帳時所用的會計科目和子目、應當力求群盡和一致例如“暫記•”和“雜項”、科目的使用、越少越好、四•收條•發票•定單•及其他記帳憑證的格式應當一律、五•結算帳目、應使用的表單、應規定合一的格式、六•各種與營業有關的契約•信件•及單據的保存也應富議定同一的方法、上述各點、都應當立即辦理、現在正是改良各業會計制度的極良好的機會、因為各業公司行號為切身的利害着想、必定樂於從事、各業同業公會正宜及時負起這個責任來、一面延請專家、代本業薦定一種簡單易行而具有統一正確性的會計制度、一面開辦簿記講習班、由會員各廠店派遺人員前來聽講習練、如此行之、可使各會員在短時間內、不必增加勞費、不必更動職員、而可以收取改良簿記正確計算損益的功用、</p>
<p>㊁切實整理資產負債的記錄、並估定其正確價額、再可分數項討論之、一•關於資本、一般工商業帳面所記載的資本額、往往不能代表牠們營業上供實際運營的資金、譬如歷年未分的盈餘、躲藏在資產裹面的秘密公積、以及資本主直接貸與營業的長期欵項等、性質與資本實在沒有差別、我國所得稅制、對於非公司組織的營利事業、也以盈利合資本實額定課稅率、在理論上、本來就有討論的餘地、因此之故、一個營利事業、以名目上不算資本的欵項來運營事業、顯然地在納稅上有不公平的負担、所以各公司行號第一步應速將其資本實額、重新準確計算、以免納稅毫無意義的吃虧、可是有一點不應忘記的、如屬公司組織、應修改章程為增資登記、如已為商號註冊、應變更已註冊的資本數目、並改訂合夥議據至於沒或辦理公司登記或商號註冊有、並宜乘此機會、完成登記的註冊的手續、因為取得了實業部的執照、當然是資本實額的最有力的證明文件了、二•關於其他負債、一般工商業的其他負債中、最重要的要算從親友方面吸收得來的存欵、通常不過在分戶清簿記戰一記號或堂名、存戶的眞實姓名和住址、只有經手人肚裹明白、現在因為吸收存欵的行號、應負扣繳所得稅的義務、所以對於帳內戶名應求顯明翔實、如有用記號堂名立戶的、應當在帳戶下加註眞實姓名•住址利率、如為定期欵項、並應記載到期日、以後年度過入新簿的時候、也應同樣辦理、如此不但圖扣繳所得稅的便利、即使經手人去職、別人繼續管理帳務、收支欵項、也就沒有什麼困難了、三•關於流動資產、A現金許多工商機關、帳簿上現金結存數額、往往不能與庫中實存的數目相一致相差時數目、即為各種性質的宕帳、如職員宕欠等、以及還期票據等類、職員宕欠欵項本來是不良習慣、應當革除、即使有急迫需要、也應當作為欠戶付帳、絕不能長久宕藏在現金庫存數內、至於應收遠期票據、也應列入“應收票據”科目內一方面可使會墳書類所表規的數字、正確表示眞實的財政狀况、更因第一類徵收須知草案、第十九條、准以不能收取的應收票據列作呆帳損失、單立應收票據一科目、也可便於查考B存貨或原料、一般工商業購進貨物、除分戶記入貨源簿表示對於進貨價額所負的債務外、對於貨物本身的出納、往往不加記錄、但於决算時、盤貨一次、以便结出损益、這不是完善的辦法、以後為便利隨時結帳、每月詳記報益及檢點現存貨物、防止走漏起見、對於貨物的出納、也應當獨立設置簿冊、以備記錄查考、每年結算時、再實地盤存－次、如果賬面記載數額與實地盤存數額發現差損時、即以“盤存消耗的科目來調整牠、關於存貨或原料、還有一點、就是原來賬面上估價若使太低、（俗所謂底子厚）可按照成本與時價執低的原則、車行估定其法律所允許的確實價格所謂時價、依第一類徵收須知第五條的規定、指結算時當地市面通行的價格而言、當地商會或同業公會共同擬訂的價格、解釋上當然視為市面通行的價格、四•關於固定資產、歷史悠久營業穩健的工商機關、為嗥防營業衰落起見、把房屋•地皮•機器•工具•生財•等類資產、為極度的折减、使與實際價格、相去懸殊、那是恒有的事例、所得稅法為防止逃稅計、對於不合理的隱藏盈餘、不得不加以取締、所以在第一類徵收須知裹、附訂了許多縝密的資產估價方法、以資遵守、這是以後的事在所得稅開始施行的時候、工商業者應當檢查一下、現在所有的資產、在賬面所表現的價額、是否實在、如果太低的話、那麼低計資產即是低計資本、也就是增重所得稅的負擔、為消弭這一種缺憾計、自應重行切實估計其價值、以達正確表示財政狀况的目的、至於各項固定資產、均應各別記載其名稱•件數•原價•時價•使用年數•及現在估定之價額、以為來日折舊的根據及查考、如有相當證明文件、如建築合同買賣契約、各項發票收條、也應當分別保存、以作證明、五•關於分支店間帳目、所得稅暫行條例施行細則第六條規定、本店及其分支店營業所、同在中華民國境內、而其資本互為劃分者、應分別計算其所得額、又第一類征收須知草案第二項規定、施行細則所稱本店及其分支店之資本互為劃分者係指分支店之資本及營業完全獨立者而言、根據上述的規定、工商機關如有分支店開設在外埠、業務負責人、即應審察實際情形、决定本店與分支店間資本有無劃分的必要、再以後分支店與本店間的往來欵項、應切實明白整理、不容稍涉含混、六•關於附屬事業的投資某一工商機關、因或種的需要、在同地或異地獨資設立性質不相同的營利事業、這種情形事所常有、但往往不獨立劃分資本、用往來戶的名義、任許透用欵項、年終結算盈虧、亦可隨意處分、在所得稅施行後、便發生問題了、依法應劃分資本獨立營業、這也是即須準備辦理的事、七•關於損失利益賬目、最重要的一點、就是一般工商業對於銷貨進貨的賬目、除在貨源簿各戶表示進貨所負的債務、及在客清簿各戶表示銷貨所生的債權、係屬資產負債性質的賬簿、並在營業賬簿上記載逐日所做的交易、係屬流水性質的補助賬以外、對於銷貨與進貨的數量價額、在總清簿上缺少－種綜合連續的記載、賬併戶的結數、僅足表示應收帳欵的已收部份、不足表示全部賒賣交易、因此營業狀況的查考、必須逐日逐戶加算不能一覽無餘、如果在總清簿設立“銷貨總額”及一進貨總額三賬戶、分別記入現進賒進現售賒賣的交易、在手續上不過稍微麻煩點、會計整理的目的、便可達到、此外如收進應收賬欵所有的抹尾找零等等、都應當別設科目、以為整理、</p>
<p>㊂注意研究所得稅法的內容　所得稅法規與工商業的關係、既極深切、工商業者對於牠的內容、尤其是申報調查審查的手續、應當透澈明瞭、並須隨時研究、如有意見、應貢獻於政府、俾使所得稅法的施行、不致遭逢窒碍、而制度本身、也可以日臻完善、以後並且要對於法院的判例、審查委員會的决議、財政部的解釋函件及命令佈告、專家學者在理論上的探討、隨時加以注意、庶幾乎平時可以應付一切、遇有困雖或爭議發生時、也可以從容不迫相機辦理、這類注意研究的事是有繼續性的、最好能由商會或同業公會領導辦理效能比較的大、</p>
<p>㊃申報是否吸收存欵及資本等項　依照財政部所得稅事務處的佈告、工商機關如受收存欵應在本年二月底以前向各地辦事處報明、公司商號行棧工廠及營利之個人、也應在二月底以前、將牌號•住址•負責人姓名•營業資本或股本實額報明、如係股份有限公司或股份兩合公司、並須將股份總額•種類•每股金額•營業年度、一併報明、</p>

<h3>調整世界的通貨</h3>
<p>— 謝菊曾譯</p>
<p>本文爲甘末爾教授新著，刋布於最近出版之Nation's　Business雜誌，特爲迻譯，以供參考。</p>
<p>在一九三六年九月二十六日，久在意料中的法國金本位的崩潰，果然正式宣布。法政府爲使人動聽起見，委婉其詞的説是向國會建議「調整通貨」，繼之便是荷蘭，瑞士，意大利，捷克，迅速地隨着作同樣的宣布。</p>
<p>與法國宣言同時的，則有美英法三國政府宣稱彼等業已成立一種力謀安定國際滙兑的恊定；雖則三國政府的文告，措詞不是一樣，但性質毫無二致。</p>
<p>道恊定的目的，據美財長毛根韜的聲明，乃是維持「國際滙兑制度最大的可能的平衡。」三國政府同意「儘量避免因此項提議調整所致的國際滙兑基礎的可能的騷亂，」並請其他各國合作，於是比利時，瑞士，荷蘭，便應邀相繼加入。</p>
<p>（一）黄金的移動</p>
<p>到了十月十三日跟着宣布了一個補充恊定。據美國方面宣稱此舉乃美國的「意思」擬「出售黄金與各國，供立時出口或指定供作平衡或安定滙兑基金之用。而此諸國又必須同樣地表示願出售黄金與美國，其條件須經美國滿意。」至出售的機關，係由紐約聯邦凖備銀行代表財部爲之，當時價格規定爲每盎司美金三五元，外加經手費千分之一·五。</p>
<p>同日美方宣布英法兩國，業已遵行恊定條件，於是這一計畫，便在三國間發生效力。</p>
<p>凡是向來關心於此一問題的人，對於這個補充恊定，一些兒也感不到驚異。因爲早經認定如果一旦法國抛棄金本位，倘使要繼續牽行國際黄金淸算起見，應該有訂立此類恊定的必要，其理由可以簡括地列舉如下：</p>
<p>美財部久已規定凡黄金由本國出口，祗以對金本位國家之能維持固定的黄金賣買價格者爲限。因爲無論何時，在自然的經濟趨勢之下，使黄金有流入美國傾向時美國惟有向這些國家可以合理的計算着獲得到黄金。而合乎此項規定的，只有法，比，荷數國。其中法國尤占重要，美國當然不在其內。至於法國本身，對於黄金輸出，原不曾加以限制，而美國對别國的黄金支付，凡包括於黄金輸出之內者，往往統行流入法國。法蘭西銀行爲願意使黄金得以輸出起見，因此特地制定了一個黄金價值的參考的基本點，同時兼爲其他國家間相互移轉黄金存欵。</p>
<p>等到法，比，荷三國抛棄了金本位，便把這個恊定全部擊破，因此美國財政部長毛根韜，於一月十三日宣布一種補充恊定，取而代之。此舉乃是三國間對於金貨淸算的一種新的明白的恊定，並邀請别的國家加入。該恊定係准許三國中的每一國家，運用它的平凖基金，將結欠其他　國的差額，按照恊定的滙率，換成黄金，或將存在海外的黄金，指撥本國帳户，或由本國輸送黄金，以供此項目的之用。</p>
<p>此事實行的結果，實際便是限制關係幾國間對於蒙受平凖基金影響的那些國家及政府代理機關的金貨移動。所以補充恊定的作用，簡直是第一次恊定的工具罷了。</p>
<p>兩種恊定的實質，包含下列三項：</p>
<p>（一）世界上最重要的二個國家，從貨幣的立塲上，在一個計畫下，實際合作，以求滙兑的安定，因爲鑒於三年前亡界經濟會議的破裂，以及近年來國際匯兑的動盪，此舉在它本身，實是一種進歩的真辦法。</p>
<p>（二）該計畫乃是設定國際淸算的機構，兼爲國際用金淸算的基礎。</p>
<p>（三）該計畫包括一種宣示，意圖减少近年來層出不窮的國際貿易限制，因爲此類限制，對於貨幣的擾亂及滙兑的變動，影響不能説是不大。</p>
<p>（二）平衡的重要勝過安定</p>
<p>但是尚有若干事情，不曾包括穩定滙兑恊定內。第一，他們不曾規定安定國際滙兑所實施的貨幣基礎。他們着眼於維持匯兑的平衡，但是關於準據着維持平衡的貨幣單位，或本位的方式等等一應重要問題，他們都不説什麽。縱觀全部恊定，它的基本計畫，也許是金本位，銀本位，複本位，物價指數本位，或竟是任何一種管理妥善的通貨。顯然地滙率的保持平衡，或是處在迅疾的通貨膨脹局面之下，或是處在迅疾的通貨緊縮局面之下。或是處在安定的物價局面之下，假定各國間的普通物價變動，都是一樣的話。同時這個恊定，也可詮釋並奉行着去迎合金本位正宗派的意旨，也可詮釋並奉行着去滿足主張商品幣本位者的願望。</p>
<p>第二，此項恊定，不曾規定確切期限，僅不過是做一日看一日的辦法。所謂「滙兑安定」或「匯兑平衡」的一個條欵，通常不能於長時期內在種種不同的通貨間固定其相對的價值。所以此三國間的「滙兑安定恊定」，天天可以提出取銷，只要當事人間任何一造實在欠缺安定的原素，就可以出而主張。</p>
<p>這個計畫或許可以容忍幾時，引入較善的境界；或許隨時隨早在滙兑戰爭裏宣告崩潰。當時受了人工激刺的結果，法，荷，意，瑞士的通貨貶值，足以裨益於這幾國的出口貿易，但在此種情形之下，德，俄，日本的通貨政策，究將如何取捨，實在是一樁嚴重的事情。</p>
<p>法國的新貨幣法，授權政府减低法郎的金成分，自百分之二五至百分之三四之間。瑞士也制定同樣法律，减低瑞士法郎的金成分自百分之三○至百分之四○。意大利則减低里拉的金成分爲百分之四○至百分之五○。至于荷蘭，對此並没有宣布確切的比例，暫時聽任荷盾浮沈于滙兑市塲。</p>
<p>差不多每國都將它的貨幣貶值，便獲到一種安定或平衡基金，從所謂「貶值利潤」裏産生出來。所謂貶值利潤，就是金準備的價值，在舊幣的金成分和新幣的金成分間所表示的差異。例如法蘭西的金凖備，從它舊價值貶到法郎所含的金成分百分之七四·八，即以此爲基礎，重行評價，就産生出「金利潤」約一七，○○○，○○○，○○○法郎，如數爲政府所有。在此數中，一○，○○○，○○○，○○○法郎——照現價約合美金四六六，○○○，○○○元——另行提開，設立平衡基金，歸法蘭西銀行管理，用以維持法律規定的限度內的法郎價值。</p>
<p>關於經由此項巨大安定基金所致的滙兑交易及金貨移動的影響，則由各關係政府加以統制，大部分均由各國中央銀行，暗中進行。</p>
<p>總而言之，這是本人的評判，就是近來金集團國家的相繼貶值，以及國際安定通貨的計畫，都是，表示向着貨幣穩定的途上前進。本人更信時候一到，行將廹令國際貨幣穩定于金基礎的上面，其理由不妨將過去歷史回溯一下。</p>
<p>（三）追求金本位</p>
<p>當歐洲大戰在一九一四年爆發的時候，差不多全體的先進國家，都是使用金本位，—就是他們對于别種本位經過多世紀的試騐與訾謬而後達到的一種本位—金本位固然不能工作的十分完善，但是比起從前所盛行的銀本位，複本位，及管理的紙本位來，究竟要高明的多。一般人的心理，都認金本位是過去試騐成績最好的貨幣本位，而對于未來的真問題，不是用某種别的本位來代替金本位的問題，却是如何使金本位成爲國際上更優越的貨幣本位。</p>
<p>當大戰期內及戰後最初二年之間，貨幣本位幾乎到處崩潰，每個金本位國家，都把它抛棄。雖則美國的脱離金本位，不如他國之甚，但是也要限制黄金的出口。至于别的貨幣本位，也一樣地宣告破裂，甚至有些國家，在戰時施行管理的紙本位，經過了極度的貨幣跌價。</p>
<p>戰事告終，各國决心從速恢復金本位，此舉顯然地使黄金的需要大見增加，倘使仍用戰前的貨幣單位，則結果物價必爲之大跌。如果各國都回復金本位到一九二○年美國的高度物價水凖，那末世界上將没有充分的黄金，足資週轉。果然，在一九二○年後期及一九二一年初期，意料中的物價崩潰，就此降臨。一年之內，美國批發物價跌落百分之四四，也即是代表黄金價值增加百分之八十。</p>
<p>此項黄金價值的增加，大足鼓勵黄金的生産，於是戰時遭受嚴重打擊的金礦業，便迅速地昭蘇。</p>
<p>和約簽訂之後，所有戰時窖藏及不活動的黄金，大都均出來流通。全世界緩緩地毅然地回復到金本位，此項窖藏金貨的流出，連同金礦産量的增加，以及黄金在貨幣使用上的節約方法的增進，適足以應付因回復金本位而起的需要。到了一九二七年，多數國家都各恢復金基礎。至於黄金價值，用它對貨物的購買力來尺度，自一九二一年後期直至一九二九年後期世界恐慌發端之前爲止，簡直是異常安定。</p>
<p>（四）貶低金價值</p>
<p>許多國家的回復金本位並不想重建他們戰前的金平價，乃是要穩定于他們那時紙幣單位裏大加貶低的金價值上面。換句話説，他們乃是穩定于代表當時本來面目的金價值上。例如法國穩定法郎于美金三·九二分，以代戰前之一九·三分；意大利穩定于美金五·二六分，以代戰前之一九·三分。至於經過瘋狂的通貨膨脹的若干國家，如波蘭，德意志等，則創造新的貨幣單位，代表當時行使的紙幣的巨大倍數的價值。例如德國，規定紙馬克一百萬兆枚，折合金馬克一枚。</p>
<p>此項穩定方法，可以使現行的物價工資因此而起的擾亂，减至極輕微的程度。但是少數歐洲國家，其通貨曾經貶值的，至是着手回復到他們戰前的金貨幣單位，就中英國便是最著的一個。等到戰時保持着的滙兑統制，一旦解放，英鎊的金值，立見下跌。直到一九二○年二月，低到美金三·一九五元。此後緩緩卜漲，但遭遇着許多阻礙相若干堅强的反動，直到一九二六年春季，重行建立金本位於往日金平價的上面爲止。</p>
<p>當英國回復金本位到美金四·八七元合一個英鎊，經過了長期期和痛苦的通貨緊縮程序，使英鎊的金值，由極度的低落，提高了百分之五二。他們政府的採用這個通貨緊縮計劃，置彼邦許多著名經濟學家和財政專家的勸告於不顧，同時對别國一般著名經濟學家的評判，也一概置之不理。而英國在這幾年及隨後幾年中所遭的經濟困難，不能不歸咎於這個猛烈的通貨緊縮政策。</p>
<p>在一九二一年至一九二九年的大部分時期中，英國物價都呈堅强的下跌，但同時美國的物價，依照美國著名的指數來尺度，却比較來得安定。</p>
<p>英鎊的緊縮，使英國出口貿易受累不淺。因爲英鎊的金值上漲，出口商向外國收到的貨欵，折合英鎊一天少似一天。例如他輸出貨物到美國，售得十萬美金，假定滙價爲三·三三1/3元，他就可以收到三萬英鎊；如果滙兑率升到四元，他只有得到二萬五千英鎊了。而在事實上，出口商成本的低落，决没有英鎊的金值上升的快。</p>
<p>通貨緊縮同時又增加了英政府戰後的財政負担，因爲提高了用以支付大宗內債及恩俸的英鎊價值。而其中最重要的一樁事情，就是英鎊的金值上漲，却不能把工資來核减一下，因爲英國的工會勢力很强，他們的反抗很有效力。這一來，便增加了英國向海外市塲競爭的輸出品的成本。所以在大部分的這個時期中，英國出口貿易倍形衰落，再也不能與美德等重要敵手在世界市塲角逐。因爲英是島國，疆域狹小，聯合二國的福利，有賴於她的國外貿易，遠較她的主要競爭諸國爲甚。</p>
<p>當一九二九年恐慌開始，全世界金本位國家的物價，一齊狂跌，到處將信任心降至低點。全世界都爭奪黄金以求安全，那時用物價來尺度黄金，黄金的價值，高得無以復加。</p>
<p>英國經過長時期的通貨緊縮，在此期內，她把紙幣約等於金圓三·一九五的價值，提高到金圓四·八七。等到她把紙幣回復到金平價，喘息未定，黄金的本身價值，爲了世界經濟恐慌，大漲特漲，因此使她踏上了更進一歩的通貨緊縮。</p>
<p>英國的金本位，終於力竭聲嘶，宣告破裂。到了一九三一年九月二十一日，便停止了黄金支付。從英鎊的金價值，迅速地瀉落。在一九三五年中，平均約較舊日美金比價低落百分之四。</p>
<p>（五）世畉幣制的重重打擊</p>
<p>本來世界貨幣制度，爲了世界經濟恐慌，業已遭遇重大壓廹，至此又備受英鎊崩潰的打擊。自從英國脱離了金本位之後，於是大多數的英國屬地，及殖民地，北歐諸國，以及南美若干國家的金本位，也都給英國連帶踢翻，把世界的通貨攪得混亂，因而引起許多的匯兑戰爭。</p>
<p>此後幾年之中，一國接連着一國，相繼放棄了金本位，甚至美國居世界上最大的金貨供給地位，也於一九三三年初期，加入了這個集團。在一九三六年開始之際，只剩下了少數國家，還保留着不景氣以前的金本位，而比利時及美國，則於貶低幣值之下，回復到金本位。</p>
<p>這種情形，引起了國際貿易及國際金融的紊亂。這是大家承認的原則，就是當一國貨幣單位的外滙價值下降，她的出口貿易，必蒙着激刺，而商品的進口，必遭受打擊。滙兑的低落，其作用彷彿對於進口貿易課一種進口税，但這是暫時的現象。一等到物價工資能够回復平衡，這現象就此消滅，此項激刺輸出與妨礙輸入，便是回復平衡的機械作用的一部份。但是這種進行需要着時間，往往又備嘗痛苦，而因滙兑激刺的出口貨，不爲對方國家所歡迎，結果他們又必對於稱做滙兑傾銷的，施行種種的限制。</p>
<p>從另一方面説，利用跌價通貨，對一國的進口貿易，科以特别負擔，可以在不經濟的實業裏，創造出新的廣大利益來。在這種情形之下，大家在市塲角逐，終於使國際貿易上堆積了一大批的限制禁例。</p>
<p>這樣的滙兑戰爭，差不多各國都受着影響。倘從邏輯上求得論結，可以歸納到反證論法。一個國家採用繼續貶低幣值的政策，用以激刺輸出，阻礙輸入，使本國的貨物，一天多似一天送到外國人手裏，而收到外國人的貨物，却一天少似一天。一個國家，决不能靠這般樣子致富。</p>
<p>（六）必將重行建立一個國際金單位</p>
<p>在此項匯兑戰爭期間，一般不曾把他們通貨貶值的國家，却大受其累。他們喪失了低賤貨幣國家的出口市塲。使他們國內實業，遭受不幸的反動，影響及於一國的預算。假使此等國家，具有充分堅實的經濟及政治力量，足以對抗這類襲擊，直到國內外物價匯率重返平衡爲止，那當然没有問題。他們儘可置之不理，而且轉可證明他們所遭的痛苦，反比貶值諸國爲少。無如事實上正好相反，使他們處於極困難的地位。</p>
<p>近來法·荷·瑞士·意大利及捷克的貶值，可使他們的貨幣單位，與前次已經貶值的諸國貨幣單位，漸趨平衡，並可除去這些金集團國家近年在世界出口貿易上競爭所遭遇的許多障礙，更可以使這些新貶值的國家，與早經貶值諸國互相角逐，成爲比過去格外來得强固的敵手。</p>
<p>凡此種種情形，如果關係各國，按着方針前進，不再因新近若干貨幣貶值，致國外貿易競爭上暫時有利與不利的轉向，重行捲入新的匯兑戰爭渦漩，那末不難趨向更安定的平衡之路。</p>
<p>雖則恊定上没有規定需要重返金本位，但是此類恊定的邏輯結果，本人敢信必將重行建立一個國際的金本位。這樣的一金本位，乃是恊定上規定的國際滙兑永久祥衡所賴以保持的惟一基礎。自然，這樣的一金本位，不能完全出之自動。一應通貨，多少必須加以管理。假定任何的永久安定國際匯兑計畫着手進行，同時又必需各國中央銀行的通力合作。</p>
<p>今日之下，世人對於銀本位或複本位的優劣，並無定論。少數地方，如英美以及北歐諸國，擁着一種很有力的輿論，贊成某種方式的管理通貨或貨物本位。但是縱使在這些國家，一般有理智的見解，總是傾向於金本位。當然，此種情形，在美國尤其來得真實。</p>
<p>吾人不妨拿一九三一年英國脱離金本位前幾個月著名的麥美倫報告書內的聲述，作爲本文的論結。</p>
<p>「……在人類技能範圍中，或許没有更重要的目標，勝過於使全世界成就一個充實的科學化的化幣制度了。但是要使世界貨幣制度早日成爲整個的一個，恐怕很少或竟不會有進歩的希望，除非從具有歷史的金本位發軔進化的結果。……」</p>

<h3>美國景氣與生絲消費之檢討（續）</h3>
<p>— 天予</p>
<p>上表明顯地昭示我們的是（一）去年的絲價，雖無前年十月後的高價，可是直維持其每磅一·六七美金的價格，而且比之前年全年的每磅平均價一·五六美金，差不多每月表示超過的金額。（二）與前年同期比較時，其超過的程度更甚，最多之月份，幾及三○％，就是以九個月的平均價來比較，也顯示着一七％左右的增加。（三）此九個月的每磅平均價格一·六六八三美金，如與一九三四年的每磅平均價一·二四二美金比較，則有三四·三％以上的著顯增加，這是非常值得注意的事。</p>
<p>根據各方面的觀察，關於可以指示一般購買力回復程度的就業率及工業率等，以去年一月乃至三月的指數與一九三四年同期比較，大概有三—六％左右的增加；而實質工資的趨向停滯，却是因爲去年中生活費的上升，至國民所得，據政府的發表，大概比之一九三四年有一四％即六千萬美金的增大。所以一般購買力之估計，約有一○％以下的向上。可是生絲的價格，比之一九三四年，竟超過三四·三％；就使生絲的購買力也和一般購買力比例的增加，比之一九三四年，也還不逮四分之一左右。這種减少率，當然除掉以减少消費數量來補救外，别無他法。這就是去年美國的絲消（九個月平均數）比之前年與一九三四年有一五—二五％减少之説明。</p>
<p>再進一歩説：美國的購買力之增進，却有生活費之騰貴，爲之抵消，尤血是去年以來，因旱災而致農産物價略飛漲，食物費因有顯著的增高，其他又因爲重工業品價格的向上，居住費燃料燈火費不得不隨而上升。在這樣生活費的高漲中，反對地被服費却呈逐月下降的趨勢。所以生絲在美國生活費高漲的跛行性中，不得不來一個消費競爭的退却，揭錄下表，以明究竟：</p>
<p>因爲消費於衣服類金額的减少，而反對地屬於必需的服用品却不能正比例的减少，於是不得不於使用的材料方面來斟酌。所以前年雖然羊毛交了特異的好運，（比一九三四年消費增加七八％）去年却不得不讓棉花與人造絲來代替，羊毛尚且如此，生絲當然更不用説，此其一。因爲農産物價格的提高，由於美國自身生産與供給的商品棉花，自得隨而騰貴；但也正因爲係國貨的關係，一般自多提倡，生絲則來自國外，没有此種的聯鎖關係，此其二。單就生絲與人造絲言，消費方面，則生絲在六七月的青黄不接時期，呈特異的萎縮；而人造絲則相反地上漲，六七月間，達未曾有之好况，消費指數上昇至一四五左右。一般地説：生絲的價格高過人造絲的某程度時，生絲的消費領域即爲人造絲所侵。這程度：根據過去的經騐，大概是二倍半左右。如人造絲的每磅價不到○·六美金，生絲價則在一·五美金以上。又如日絲Special　XX　Crack在紐約現物市塲，十個月的每磅價平均爲一·八美金，華絲白廠經二十一中者，亦在一·七美金左右，這種價格的差别，實是人造絲侵佔生絲的唯一理由。放棄被生絲獨佔的婦人手編襪不論，單就佔美國全消費將半的織物來講，則生絲對人造絲的競爭，現全面的退却；這裏尤其是於廣幅織物方面。這種解釋，根據井上氏的意見，一方由於美國國民對服用纖維的消費心理，已與恐慌前異趣，而從經濟方面打算。另一方面，更以生絲的價格高昂，且變動過大，而織物原料費的變動，隨即直接地表現於製品方面，使價格不能穩定。於是一般織物業者，相對的表現着裹足的態度，這確是切合時勢之見。</p>
<p>總之：美國經濟景氣的結果，是使絲價隨一般物價而上漲；（這裏當然不能忘記與供求的關係—由於供給量的减少消極地刺㦸絲價上漲）可是因爲（一）美國的景氣是尚在回復之途，究還没有達到常態時一般的正規化，而不免有多少的跛行性質。（二）在這個大家積極凖備世界二次大火併的前夜，景氣多少帶有鋼鐵的氣味；於生絲缺乏直接的影響力量。所以生絲價格高漲的結果，反對地促使生絲消費的没落。可知生絲所受景氣之賜，並不是和其他一樣，正比例的利益均霑。雖然這裏也不能否認其有相當力量的刺㦸作用。</p>
<p>五、中日絲在美國市塲</p>
<p>在分析過美國的景氣及於生絲消費的影響之後，接着我們要討論的是中國和日本之美國消費的二大生絲供給國的情形。因爲：兩國因其地理與人事的相異，對美國消費的供給，自各有其不同的趨向。而對此問題的檢討，因爲與中國有其直接影響的關係，故也是本文重要目的之一。</p>
<p>過去。美國生絲消費市塲，是爲日本所獨佔；最近數年，更由佔全額的八○％昇至九○％以上。這裏首蒙影響的，當然是中國的生絲。按統計，中國生絲輸美的没落，由一九二三年的二五％退讓至一九三四年的二％以下。可是在一九三五年，就美國的消費略形增進後的趨勢來看，則華絲與日絲是表現着强烈的鬥爭。據美國全國織物業聯合會的調查，則一九三五年日本輸美與一九三四年的比較，僅增進九·五％，（計一九四三年爲四二一，○○六包，一九五年爲四六一，二四六包）而華絲的輸美，一九三五年對一九三四年比較，則差不多增至三倍左右。（計一九三四年七，八○七包，一九三五年爲二二，七六一包）至消費數量：則日絲僅增加六·七％，（計一九三四年爲四四六，○○四包，一九三五年爲四七五，九五二包）而華絲則增加七七％左右。（計一九三四年爲一○，三一六包，一九三五年爲一八，二五七包）其競爭的劇烈，概可想見，而於前年中國的蠶絲業何以特受良好的刺㦸這一點，也可瞭然了。</p>
<p>因爲世界生絲的供給國，主要係中日兩國，故對於生絲的輸出，差不得有其反比例的關係存在。因之華絲與日絲，在去年的消費競爭，仍舊極形緊張，據上述機關的調查，去年十個月來美國生絲的輸入，如以前年的每月平均數爲基數，而觀察其最近的傾向時，中日兩國，俱示减退的趨勢。而華絲的衰落程度，比之日本，實低過一四點，計日絲十個月來平均比前年减退一六％，華絲則有三○％的低落。但最近則俱漸有恢復的傾向。兹揭錄華絲與日絲十個月來的輸美情形如下，以見全豹：</p>
<h3>所得税申報表類之編製法（四）</h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>（一）行號報告表（續）</p>
<p>（一）備考　以上各種事項塡畢後，其他事項之須同時申報者，可塡入備考地位。此種備考事項，約有二端，（一）公積金及盈餘滾存等。依照現行關於所得税之法律，雖未能於計算所得税税率時，併入資本計算，然社會上請求財政部於納税須知中特施行細則第七條及第十五條所定公積金之範圍放寛者甚多。將來或可達到目的。則現在先行申報，亦不爲無益。（二）本支店可各别申報其行號，而其營利事業所得，可合併計算，以繳納所得税。依照所得税暫行條例施行細則第六條之規定，本支店資本之互爲劃分者，應分别計算其所得額。第一類營利事業所得税徵收須知草案第二條之規定云，施行細則第六條所稱本店及其分支店之資本互爲劃分者，係指分支店之資本及營業完全獨立者而言。又據財政部之解釋云，如分支店之牌號與總店不同，而其資本及營業非完全獨立者，其所得仍歸總店合併計算。凖此而言，本支店分别計算所得税者當極少。無論其牌號是否相同，資本是否劃分，祗須其資本之來源相同，即可合併課税。所謂營業完全獨立者，事實上蓋不常有也。故申報行號時，應將分支店之名稱及地址，塡入備考地位，以便將來合併課税時有所查考</p>
<p>（七）塡報月日　塡報本表之月日，亦應塡明。凡上開各事項之所申報者，皆塡報當時之情形也。將來遇有變更，無論其所變更者爲何種事項，均須爲變更之申報。收受本　之機關，爲當地主管徵收機關。在上海即爲財政部所得税上海辦事處，（在江海關大樓四樓）送去時，可記入回單簿，取得收件回單爲憑。依照本報告表之格式，無須蓋用行號之圖記，亦無須另備書函也。</p>

<h3>談梅</h3>
<p>— 唐東園</p>
<p>梅，古文作某，象子在木上之形，後作梅，從每，諧聲也，書云：「若作和羮，爾惟梅鹽，」若是則媒合衆味之意，故書家訛爲甘木，以梅爲楳也。</p>
<p>孤山庾嶺，名著詞章，梅妃梅軒，事列傳記。宋林逋結廬西湖孤山不娶無子，多植梅畜鶴，以爲梅妻鶴子。古人以梅與松竹，並稱爲歳寒三友，蓋能助人以淸高雅潔之風度也。</p>
<p>梅，早春先葉開花，芳香郁烈，故賈思勰曰：梅花優於香，桃花優於色。予曰：不然，誰不於鄧尉，西溪，之梅盛開時，獨行其間，不呼，香色俱優。</p>
<p>梅，薔薇科，落葉性，葉廣橢圓形，或卵形，先端尖，緣邊多鋸齒，幼時樹勢直伸，枝多，花密，甚呈美態；及老，幹漸樛曲，樹心朽腐，而生空洞，然外方抽枝開花，益呈蒼老高雅之狀。</p>
<p>范石湖著有梅譜，載九十餘品，然近人稱有數百品，大别爲白梅紅梅，單瓣重瓣，四大類，江梅，一名野梅，直脚梅，山間水濱荒寒淸絶之境産之，花瓣小，灰白色，香氣馥郁，疎生於枝。日本居類書云：「梅有四貴，貴稀而不貴繁，貴老而不貴嫩，貴瘦而不貴肥，貴含而不貴開」。江梅可謂四美兼具。早梅一名冬至梅，廣羣芳譜云：「花勝直脚梅，吳中春晚，二月始爛漫，獨此品於冬至前已開，故得早名，錢塘湖上，亦有一種開尤早，余嘗重陽日，新折之，有横枝對菊開之句」花單瓣紅色，亦有白色；又有八朔梅，中秋開花，淡紅多瓣，小輪可愛。早梅結實者人都珍之。此外，尚有消梅，黄香梅，鶴頂梅，黄金梅，冬梅，紫梅，六瓣梅，重葉梅，綠蕚梅，鴛鴦梅等，俱皆著名，考古籍尚有墨梅，照水梅，品字梅，杏梅，麗枝梅。</p>
<h3>紫羅蘭盦所栽之盆梅</h3>
<h3>梅屋雜拾</h3>
<p>— （周瘦鵑）</p>
<p>自吾政府明定梅花爲國花後，予遂愛梅成癖，於所居廣植梅花，且構小屋曰梅屋，疊小丘曰梅丘，其植於盆盎中者，亦纍纍然梅也。春初花發，與紫羅蘭相爲嫵媚，日夕細領色香，可以糞土蛾眉，期月不近房闥。丙子春，易子君左自京江來觀吾梅，賦詩見贈云：仙姿玉骨絶人寰，換得輕顰是嫩寒，紅粉新妝穿繡襖，梅花香裹紫羅蘭。一裹字奇妙。</p>
<p>葉譽虎先生卜居吳下，時相過從，亦癖梅，家藏梅花二十餘盆，爲故吳中藝梅專家胡煥章氏舊物，崚嶒鐵骨，彌見蒼古。日者踵門觀賞，見有一幹元立如鷹隼者，著白花數朶，自然入畫。臨别承以遐庵詩稿見貺，盥薇雒誦，愛不忍釋；中有詠梅兩絶，尤所篤嗜，如小遊仙云：丹方雲帳鎖烟霞，色界人天認未差，我厭仙踪還擾擾，獨騎孤鶴踏梅花。夜坐云：空庭獨樹隱歸鴉，珠箔無聲濕露華，十二回廊淸似水，夜深孤月守梅花。似不食人間烟火人語。</p>
<p>梅以綠蕚爲上，如淡妝美人，亭立月明中，最有幽致。予近得一綠梅老樁，高僅尺許，枯幹粗如人臂，著花十餘，疎落有畫意，至可愛玩。昔人之詠綠梅者，予頗愛吳蘭雪坐月一絶云：林塘幽絶似山家，坐轉闌陰月未斜，仙鶴一雙都睡著，冷香吹遍綠梅花。又邵心炯拗春云：拗春天氣酒難賒，微雪初晴日易斜，今夜瓦爐停藥帖，細君教煮綠梅花。兩詩亦淸雋，如綠梅花。</p>
<h3>探梅</h3>
<p>— 張真相</p>
<p>江南春早！紅梅傳來的春訊，尤其是今年的西湖，没有冰封凍鎖的銀跡；令人覺得在江南是得着機會，首先迎頭趕上春了。</p>
<p>海上茶商在湖上的一所汪莊，早在立春前幾天，我們就看到滿樹極鮮妍的朶朶紅梅，我們想起十四五年前，汪精衛先生的一首「鄧尉山探梅」七絶。原詩云：「林外春山斷復連，泮冰池水乍涓涓，田家籬落欹疏處，一樹紅梅分外妍」。從這首詩裏所顯示出的賞鑑力，畢竟是高人一等。特别着眼在「田家離落欹疏處」，講出紅梅另有一種動動人的妍姿。這在一般遊山玩水的人們，似乎有不足語此之感，我們帶着一般人遊湖的心情，也只能在汪莊那種環境裏，才覺得朶朶紅梅有特别生動的姿態，換到别處，似乎就很不易説啦！</p>
<p>在江南一些朋友家裏，先看到幾盆紅梅的盆景，總以爲是用人工烘出的。及至到汪莊看到湖上的紅梅，方曉得大自然空氣的温和，就是天造的花房。</p>
<h3>日本與梅花</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>日本人最喜歡的當然是他們的國花櫻花，但是櫻花不能耐久，盛衰不到一周，並且不宜作爲盆栽，以供案頭，這是最大缺點。梅花不但枝幹百態，種類又多，高大的佈置庭園，低小的可作盆栽，一切都比櫻花合宜。因此喜歡種植的日本人，對於我國的國花梅花，是十分愛護珍貴的。但是在日本梅花的價格很貴，照他們的風俗，在元旦一定要供着松竹梅三友的。普通人家，只在門前插着松竹，家裏「床之間」裏便不能再供着一盆梅花了。</p>
<p>日本單瓣的梅花，有玉蕚，黄金梅，雪盃，滿月，玉紅等種。重瓣的更多，有白雲龍簾內，錦梅，唐梅，㬇山白，月影，殘月等種。鹿兒島紅梅，較我國鐵骨紅，顔色更深，故一名真黑梅。日本人的梅花盆栽，和我國大不相同的。我國普通花圃裏的盆梅，大部以開花茂盛爲主要，剪紥姿態是十分粗俗的，直立的盆梅，雖無匠氣，但是任其自然之後，又失了疏影横斜的美態。因此我國除了專家種植供私人欣賞之外，真不容易得到盡善盡美的本子。</p>
<p>松柏盆栽是日本有名的種植，他們培養梅花，也和松柏一樣，除了花種花色之外，枝幹的姿態，花盆山石，都十分注重。好在日本種植花木的，不是大花圃，便是下野軍人和有閑貴族。因此不以賣買爲主，各種均可考究了。日本盆栽唯一的要道，是將一顆很小的樹木，培養得和一顆大樹一樣，種在花盆中間，欣賞把玩，要宛如立在大樹下面。俯仰流覽相同。在日比欲盆梅展覽會中，曾見有一顆名「紅枝垂」的，椏枝都向下垂，細長如柳。還有名「見驚」的，幹木枯空異常，摇摇欲墮，但是着花無數，淸奇絶倫。有四本並植在一盆中的，各具姿態，形如梅林，而高度均不及尺，佈置得很有條理。盆梅的幹木，均不粗大，重在彎曲姿勢。露根者均附青苔山石，有我國古畫意。日本盆栽，除松柏之外，當推盆梅，其次則爲菊花及雜果花木了。</p>
<p>生花瓶花在冬天，亦以梅花爲主，有時襯以山茶水山和松竹，要維持到櫻花開放爲止。日本女子都學生花，用科學方法使耐久不謝。我國插花時，先將火炙其切斷處，直立水中亦可持久。據日本人云，此法切斷處宜成斜形，使面積增大，火炙後立即插在水中，勿使空氣侵入幹內。則幹中所包之水分，可以受火炙而成蒸氣，直昇至幹頂以爲花朶營養，故梅花可以維持至一月以上了。</p>
<h3>觀梅（上）</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>時間的巨輪很迅速地在人生底軌道上飛駛着，它帶走了我的童年，碾碎了我的青春；那窮困潦倒的生活却苦苦地鞭策着我，使我離開了可愛的故鄉，離開了温暖的家，由這個城市流浪到那個城市，由那個城市，又飄泊到另一個都市中，許多崎嶇的世路就那樣怱忙地奔了過去，自己從没有餘暇來想到一些風雅的事情，雖然我並不是不懂風雅，或不愛風雅，但一切的奇妙意念也早經跟着那生活的煩惱的歳月溜走了呵！</p>
<p>有時，自家偶然也會想起一些有閒的樂事，如：旅行，看潮，尋勝，訪梅等。尤其是訪梅，自己一想起了梅花，便會想到那漫山遍野都是梅林的故鄉來，雖然在童年的時候，只要到了梅花盛放的季節，自己差不多每天和那些遊伴們在梅林掩蔽下奔跑跳躍的。那兒，山坡上，郊原中，許多梅樹的枝條上，全塗滿了一球一球皚皚如雪的素艷花朶，在日光下發着銀鉑的光；它在這枯灰色的背景下，更襯托出了處子般幽静可愛。不過那時自己雖則對於梅花已有一份好感，可是却不解得什麽呌做疎影横斜，什麽呌做暗香浮動，只是有時在山峯上望下來，看着那白茫茫的一大片銀海，和把梅樹摇動幾下，見到無數梅瓣繽紛如飛雪似的從枝頭上飄落下來的當兒，覺得它十分好看罷了。</p>
<p>在最近，自己爲了失業而得到了一些閒暇，於是得在梅花盛放的季節裏，跑到這裏來，欣賞那素艷如雪的梅花。</p>
<p>可是今年春天，氣候寒冷得真有點兒像是三九嚴冬，所以我雖然揀在梅花盛放的季節回來，然而梅花却還深沉地酣睡在夢裏。這可給了我一個失望，這失望是重重地打進了我心底深處。</p>
<p>半月來天氣總是陰鬱着的，而且時寒時暖，因此大自然里也找不到春天的影子；迄至最近，天是晴朗了，氣候也和暖了，於是屋角上的幾株老梅樹上已在吐着一朶朶的梅瓣。一天，兩天，三天……枝頭上的蓓蕾都已開放了，那素色的影子在玻璃窗外跳動着；從此，我彷彿回復了我的童年，找到了我的青春。每天侵晨，將那扇格子玻璃窗推開向外面看，好像一個饑餓的囚犯，站在鐵栅裏邊盼望自由和麵包一樣，我只是那麽貪婪地觀賞。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回（絮語感慈幃懺情殉孝秋光黯翠黛觸景書懷）</p>
<p>夢蘭道：不是不是。我現在是另一種想法。就在今天，我要决定我應當做怎樣一個人。或者是舊的人呢，或者是新的人呢？這兩種隨便我挑一種人做，决不應當徘徊在新或舊的路上。二少奶道：那末，我就不知道退的更問妹妹一句話了。你倒是願意做舊的人呢？或者是做新的人呢？夢蘭將喝完了茶的空杯子拿在手上，揑得很緊的摇撼了幾下。在他那摇撼的時候，非常吃力，似乎那茶杯隨時有揑破的可能。二少乃倒嚇了一跳，只有怔怔的向他望着。他咬了嘴唇，沉思了很久，自言自語的道：爲人難！我還是挑容易的作，作個孝女罷。二少奶把話談到了這裏，覺得不能更向下問了。因微笑道：妹妹，我是個直性子人，只管説得痛快，忘了忌諱，有許多話是不應當告訴你的。告訴過你以後，我又有一點後悔，母親知道了，不要説我多嘴嗎？夢蘭道：這個你儘可以放心，我决不能説是你告訴我的。再説，我已死了心了，不想有什麽出頭的日子，縱然你告訴過我，也没有什麽關係。二少奶站着，將手理理鬢髮，笑道：我也不管你聽了我這話打算怎麽樣？反正我説的是實話。縱然讓母親知道了，也不能説我造謡，我想母親也早要把這事告訴你，只是説不出口來罷。他説着這話，還是手扶了桌沿，向夢蘭注視着。脚雖向前微微的移了一歩，但是他並不走開。夢蘭道：你還猶豫着什麽？還有應當告訴我的話，没有説出來嗎？二少奶注視他微笑着，接上摇了兩摇頭道：没有什麽可説的了。説着，還走向前來，握住了夢蘭的手摇撼了兩下。這才回頭望了他兩次，緩緩的下樓而去。當然，夢蘭坐在小樓上，把嫂嫂的話，想了一遍，更增了無數的心事。在二嫂説話的時候，倒也不感覺有什麽奇異之處。只是在他説完話以後，却是一而再，再而三的，只管向人看着，好像還有一句要説的話不曾説出來。於是先靠了桌子，撑住頭想想。隨後又躺到床上，側身抱了枕頭，閉了眼想想。最後起來，靠了窗户檻，看着天上的白雲。直等天上的雲變了紅色，一陣陣的烏鴉，零落着由天空飛過，眼見這一天的光陰，又是糊塗的消磨了。（一四一）</p>

<h3>我們紀念「三八」要—</h3>
<p>— 金光楣</p>
<p>一年一度紀念的三八婦女節，今天又到了。</p>
<p>紀念的意義，是要我們檢討過去的工作，把握現在的實况，剏造未來的前途。</p>
<p>在國難嚴重之今日，我們紀念三八婦女節，顯然的這裏是深給了我們一種特殊的任務，我們的民族，是被壓廹被侵略的民族，我們的國家是在死中求生，努力自救的國家。因此我們的負荷，要較諸其他一般國家的婦女要更繁重，更艱巨。</p>
<p>無疑的，我們婦女是整個民族解放運動中被推進的一員，但我們也不能忽略了我們自身的力量，亦足以帮助民族解放運動前途之展開。開也不能無視這種交互的作用。</p>
<p>在此統一救國，自力救亡的民族復興洪流中，我們婦女所應集中和珍惜所有的人力與財力，以自効於國家者，自亦不能有異於他人。</p>
<p>因此，在國難現階段中，紀念「三八」，我們應當以三民主義爲共同信仰，在民族利益高於一切的前提下，努力於我們今後的工作，爭取我們光榮燦爛的前程。</p>
<h3>三八節告全國婦女書</h3>
<p>— 王孝英</p>
<p>偉大光榮的「三八」節，又於今日悄悄的來臨了！</p>
<p>「三八」節是婦女運動史上最燦爛的一頁，不，牠是人類進化史上最值得歌頌的一頁！我們應怎樣向着這光耀的日子致着快意的敬禮呵！</p>
<p>然而在這國難嚴重，山河破碎的今日，我們來紀念這「婦女解放節」，使我們感覺到中國婦女界所負的責任是異常的重大，———因之紀念的意囊也就特别地深長了！</p>
<p>婦女運動在中國已有三十餘年的歷史了，追溯以往，一方面婦女們爲了自身的解放，社會的進化，民族的自由，與平等，在種種艱苦奮鬥的過程中得到不少的成就，盡了應盡的責任，由「五四」，而「五卅」，而「九一八」，而「一二八」，以至於今日，婦女們無時無地不站在反帝運動的最前綫，英勇地幹着救亡的工作，客觀的事實，早已有了正確的證明，此地用不着多事嘮叨。</p>
<p>但在另一面，婦女們却也不免有若干缺點：考其中之最著者即大多數婦女如散沙似的缺乏團結的精神，因無團結的精神，以致對於任何一件事體所獲得的實效往往不能和我們理想中所盼望的相符合，這是一件多麽痛心疾首的事，我敢説：過去婦女運動如有鐵般的團結精神，其成績當較勝於今日千萬倍了！</p>
<p>是的，「過去」即如「死去」，今後應怎樣來補救我們的缺點呢？誠然，補救之道甚多，但我以爲目前急需努力的工作便是：——</p>
<p>第一個是團結！第二個是團結！第三個還是團結！</p>
<p>因爲有團結才有偉大的力量；有偉大的力量，才能抵抗敵人的侵略，挽救民族的危機，才能樹立一切偉大艱難的事業而可獲得驚人的成績了！</p>
<p>全國婦女們，在光榮的「三八」節的今日，爲了民族，爲了國家，爲了自身，我們一致團結起來吧！</p>
<h3>近年來中國婦女運動之檢討及今後應趨之途徑</h3>
<p>— 江蕙若</p>
<p>今日三八節爲國際婦女勞工運動之紀念日。遠瞻世界各國勞工婦運之成績，近察我國婦運之現狀，不禁感慨係之焉。兹爲篇幅所限，世界婦運暫置不論，祗就我國近年來婦運之銷沉，略加以檢討：</p>
<p>一二年前，我國或有人主張；宜效法意德政策，高呼『女子回家庭去，』騰出空位，以畀男子。一時附和之者甚衆。如此飲鴆止渴之政策，雖暫能救濟一部分失業男子於一時，但終非久長之策。何則？蓋職業婦女休職歸家，依父夫　生，如父夫收入豐富，則婦女回歸家庭後，席豐履厚，優游歳月，度其寄生生活，而爲父夫者極其精力，以贍養其妻女，終其身爲妻女作牛馬，我真爲此等男子叫屈不止也，此就中上之家而論耳，若中下之家，父夫辛勤作工所得，不足以贍其妻孥，勢必賴妻女出外工作，以補家用之不足，若一旦解職歸家，社會間雖美其名曰『治理家政』，但巧婦難爲無米之炊，究其極，柔順者自怨自艾；桀黠者爲非作惡；此種情形，彰彰在人耳目。有識之士，羣起攻擊，以爲男女應各就其個性作工，方能造成幸福之家庭，富强之國家。故去年來，婦女回歸家庭之呼聲，不復聞矣。</p>
<p>我國二萬萬二千萬女開胞，能受教育者，不及千分之一，而千分之一之內，除少數受大學教育者外，其餘惟受中小學教育。小學教育爲國民教育，兹姑不論。然試環觀吾國女子中等教育，皆施以普通教育，預備升入大學之用。但試問我國中學畢業生，能升入大學者有幾？而一般受過中學教育之女子，無一技之長不能適應社會，浪費人材，可勝浩嘆。故我謂今後女子中等教育，宜着重職業教育，庶一般無力升學之女子，歩入社會後，不致有才不勝任，萬事棘手之感也。此從事婦女運動應努力改進者一也。</p>
<p>現今中上層之婦女，皆斤斤較量於自身之利益，對於大多數勞動婦女之痛苦，熟視之若無覩。今後應努力輔助勞動婦女，去除其痛苦，改善其生活，施以相當之教育，以先覺覺後覺，以先知覺後知，務使勞動婦女脱離困苦壓逼之生活，而同登平等自由之樂園。此今後從事婦運應努力改進者二也。</p>
<p>上述意見，是否有當，尚祈海內明達，加以指教。幸甚。</p>
<h3>三八節感言</h3>
<p>— 吳戴儀</p>
<p>時代不斷地前進，一年一度的三八節，又來臨了，這莊嚴偉大的國際婦女節。是世界婦女解放運動的紀念日，也可以説是世界婦女覺悟的一天。我們追念着前人的努力，應該如何的繼續奮鬬？這是在紀念三八節時，全世界的婦女們，所應共同注意的一點。</p>
<p>關於三八節的史實，凡是從事婦女運動和智識界的婦女們，大概没有不知道的了。我感覺到中國的婦女運動，和其他各國的有顯著的不同，所以就管見所及，拉雜的無系統的隨便談談，也許這隨便的談談，會切合現在的需要吧！</p>
<p>時代是不斷地前進，環境也各别的不同。每一問題的對付，是必須要適應時代，審察環境，中國婦女運動的口號，果然和各國同樣的要求解放，但是中國是一個教育不普及生産很落後的國家，社會的封建勢力，既未根本剷除，婦女的自身的道德智能，依然没落，外患內憂，交相煎廹，民族危亡，岌焉不可終日。所以中國的婦女運動的最大的目的，除要求解放外，應該以復興民族爲前提。否則不務其本而齊其末，我敢斷言是没有結果的。</p>
<p>中國婦女，法律已賦予政治經濟上和男子一樣的平等，所以中國的婦女們，根本無需再爭那權利上的平等原則，至於自由的範圍，在法律許可之下，也和男子没什麽歧視，不過事實還不盡然，依舊脱不了有名無實，原因是數千年的宗法制度，封建遺毒，深入人心，一時不易改革；而婦女教育職業等的不能並遍，是障礙婦運進展的最大原因！在這種情形之下，普及婦女教育和提倡婦女職業，實在是一件急不容緩的當前的急務。</p>
<p>近年來智識界的婦女們，已漸次的覺悟了，佔大多數的婦女們，還是不知不覺的安於他們的固有的黑暗的生活，她們不但是什麽都不知道，並且以爲是應該這樣的。多可憐呀，這些無知的婦女！先知先覺的婦女們，是負有覺醒她們的責任的。我相信要是她們不參加我們的集團，婦女運動，永遠没有澈底成功的一天。深入民衆，是十分需要的喲。</p>
<p>我們既然明白了今後應行努力的方針而實地去做了，同時還得積極的去剷除一切的障礙，毫不猶預地毅然决然地向前邁進，不偷安，不畏難，不妥洽，不屈服，然後可以實現我們的理想。謹在這光榮的紀念日，貢獻些膚淺的見解。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>人之謀我</h3>
<p>— 羅才淸</p>
<p>讀完了本報的到百靈廟去，我彷彿也身處其境似的，有一位兵士對我說着：“當兵的就恐死得不得其所，這次是我們惟一的機會，豈肯輕易放過”中國是向來被稱為最酷愛和平的民族，和世界最好的市場，然而，還有無數“都情願拿血肉之軀，和敵人拚命，為整個國家民族自由而犧牲”的英勇的將士，—并不是“槍彈從背而入”的將士</p>
<p>不過，正如作者所说“我們覺得最可痛心的，就是這次敵人所用的一千多萬元戰費，都是從冀東偽組織走私項下撥來，而所用的槍械砲彈和轟炸的飛機，都是瀋陽兵工廠出品，拿中國人的錢，充中國人自相殘殺的戰費，拿中國人所製的軍器，來屠殺中國人，這是何等兇狠殘忍的手段！”人之謀我，已經無所不用其極，再看此次收復百靈廟所收穫的三件珍寶”：一是盛岛少將的“用兵紀要”一書，書內有特別記載,可以佈置軍事要塞，屯聚食糧的地方，都調查得清清楚楚;第二件是五萬分之一，和十萬份之一的軍事地圖各－本，由察北各盟旗起，至甘肅寗夏蘭州，都測量得異常精細調到；第三件是敵侵略西北的各種計劃書，使人毛骨為之悚然!</p>
<p>我們這個“地大物博，物產豐富”的國家，他們已經為之打算到很週到了，而且深入各地的如鄭州特務機關等都在或明或暗地進行他們“野心家的迷夢”！同日（七日）我們又在某報上讀到東京特约通信，說是他們完成了一張國際電影呌做“新土”的，是一對夫婦到滿洲去開闢他們的“新土”的故事，片中有一首“新土”的歌：“沒有土地人們啊！往哪里去？看啊，越過了海的大陸之天地！那里有土地在等着我們。”</p>
<p>“我們能把東北四省國土由人家作為“新土”而永久估據着嗎？”</p>
<h3>坐不花錢的黃包車</h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>肚子很餓，照慣例是加快著脚步趕回家去，自己弄打汽爐燒飯吃，可是從霞飛路一轉入了環龍路時，却想起了，久不在家，而且家里没有菜，那未，到哪兒去咧？—心才轉上個念頭，脚步却慢下來了。腦子里是胡胡塗塗地打轉，差不多面前碰了塊牆壁也不會覺得了似的那未定神。但是，倐忽地耳邊却響着一個陌生的，低沈的，焦急而又不自然的呼喚聲：</p>
<p>“先生，車啊！”</p>
<p>不慣坐車的我，尤其是在這更沒有坐車的必要的時候，雖已覺得有點異乎尋常，而到底是非常平淡的語句掉在後頭，脚仍在走自己的路。</p>
<p>然而！</p>
<p>“謝謝你，”這會儿我不得不注意地啼聽這一定含有什末祕密的拉客的黃包車夫的說話了。“謝謝你坐我的車過去，—亞爾培路！謝謝你。”</p>
<p>雖說是謝，但這到底是不必要，所以即使曾注意聽這已很有力的話，但仍很不在乎的在走我自己的。而且不是嗎，自己心里正三上五落地沒着落的還是吃飯問題：燒，不成：到館子，那可吃不消；那未，難道真要吃上碗陽春麺拉倒嗎，似乎也很不興，……</p>
<p>“先生，做做好事吧！先生：先生</p>
<p>這意外的聲音終於把我從雜亂的情緒中喚醒了過來。於是，我不得不以奇異的眼光來注視這位哀求別人坐他的車子的傢伙了—一個黃包車夫，跟在馬路上所看到的整千整萬的都沒有特殊的差別，也是黧黑的臉龐，粗壯的胳膊，還有那雙健跑的腿，不還是跟尋常的車夫一般地粗大，叢着毛，很健而有力的嗎。年紀雖然大一點，也不过四五十歲，决不至於便是跟別人搶生意不到而至於用好說話來求人坐地的車的弱者。……</p>
<p>我才沒有仔細端詳完畢這個奇怪的車夫，他却已在他的打着皺的额角露出了希望的火光，圓活的眼珠子在向我示意，兩手也把車槓停了下來，腰曲着，成了一個讓人上車的姿势。我明白這一定是因為我注视他以後而討來的麻煩。不過，我既沒這種需要，即使類似這種綁票式的行動我也决不能將就的。於是，我連端詳的工作也不繼續地，便昂起了頭，當作很象從沒這回事地向前走去了。然而，這個奇異的陌生者却始終沒讓我從他的手里溜走似的，我的耳尕很清澈地聽到他拉着車跟上來了。而且還說—</p>
<p>先生！不要你錢的！謝謝你……”</p>
<p>我的神经感着一下抽搐，頭馬上又掉轉了來，這陌生的車夫却居然把车也拖了來，含着哭，又是－個迎人的樣式。而我，這無恥的貪利的人馬上又給自尊心制止了這一飢不擇食的舉動，略一猶豫之後，紅了一下臉兒又昂了頭走着自己的了。</p>
<p>“不要你錢的！不要你錢的……”</p>
<p>疲倦了，我自己知道。但，這到底是什未一會事：這社會那里會有不花錢的便宜貨。然而，如今這不花錢的便宜貨便居然送到面前來了，這不會是一件欺騙的，或者甚至比這還更可怕的事嗎？可是，對着這在耳邊不斷地嗡嗡地呌着的怪事，居然也引起了好奇來了。</p>
<p>於是，脚便略為頓了一下了。這陌生的傢伙很像害怕我便真的會從他的手里逃走一樣，很快的又追了上來。又是一個迎人的姿勢，嘴吧里却更可憐地懇求了：</p>
<p>“謝謝你，不要你錢的！拖過馬路，不要你錢的！”</p>
<p>這趟，一股勇氣使我坐了上去了，而他，我這可憐的自討苦吃的陌生者，却很像非常賣力地拖了車子朝西直跑。過了邁而西愛路口，我才發覺了滯留在那馬路的東面的還有不少的車子，而他們，那些可憐的車夫們却都用羡慕的眼光注視著我这輛車子。這時我心放了一大半了，稍為憶測得到了這件事的巧妙的一點，後來却更索性问這幸運的車夫，而他是，这未快活地答着：</p>
<p>“空車不准拖啦！”</p>
<p>又是文明人的交通规例吧。於是我更開始和這已熟識了的人谈話了。</p>
<p>“不准拖，那不是给困在那邊了嗎？”</p>
<p>“不是嗎，這樣一輩子也沒有生意的，除非過了霞飛路，但那更不用想”</p>
<p>“那末，要交班怎樣？”</p>
<p>“天曉得。”</p>
<p>“沒理講的嗎？”</p>
<p>“這世界那講理！昨天一下不留神，給撬照會又罰了五角大洋，還白拖了一天車呢。那你又跟誰講去！……”</p>
<p>他的話未完，目的地已到了，我們這奇異的而又短促的關係已算完了。他，却像一頭出了籠的鳥兒－樣，却正燃着了他的希望的火光呢。（邂逅草）</p>
<h3>探梅</h3>
<p>— 江静丁</p>
<p>這次寒假裹回浙江去，車上碰到杭州的老朋友，他硬拖我在杭州住一夜去，好在杭州也已三年不見面了，住一夜玩一天也是好的。當天晚上便住在朋友家裹第二天的早上，又去訪了幾個久不見面的朋友，人馬一多，玩與更好，於是决定去看梅花，（不如說去“尋梅”吧）雖然這天沒有下着雪。</p>
<p>十一點鐘便吃飽了肚子，我們三人開始從旗下出發了。</p>
<p>湖堤兩旁的柳葉兒都落光了，只剩下一些枯枝在那裹搖擺。走到西湖博覺橋的橋端，這里便是孤山的範圍了；傍孤山北簏向西行走，不二百步，梅花開得正盛，時時地襲過一陣清清的幽香來。在路旁我拾到了一朵從殘酷的人們手中遣下的白色梅花，我將她拾來挿在自己的前襟，好幽香的氣味啊。我只覺得這朶白色的梅花，好像是一位潔身的小姑娘，她是從獸性的人的性慾期中逃脫出來的幸運兒。</p>
<p>心里這樣－想，彷彿我們不應該來探梅似的。走到蘇曼殊墓前，久久不想再走，看着許多朝孤山那邊走的遊客，大概又有不少梅枝犧牲在他們手里了。</p>
<h3>賽金花（一）</h3>
<p>— 陳禾作</p>
<p>社會制度的惡劣，人們因着經濟的壓迫，不管是危險，恥辱，祇要是能掙錢的勾當，就不顧一切而去幹了。金雲仙她是惟利是圖的女子：她見着賽金花美麗，就騙賽到各花船上去玩，暗裹偷賺了許多錢，年幼無知的賽金花，從此被黑暗的社會所吞噬了！</p>

<h3>陳波兒歸來了</h3>
<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>陳波兒從綏遠勞軍回來了，她是昨天早晨七時四十分的平滬通快車到的。這次回來的祇有她一人，據説，其他團員都早回來了，還没有回來的祇吳似鴻和崔嵬倆，吳似鴻因爲有些私事，要上青島去一次，崔嵬則還留在北平，因爲她預備參加三月十五日在綏遠舉行的軍民追悼大會</p>
<p>在她們留在北平的時候，上海不是有關於她們被軟禁的流言嗎，其實這流言是不確的，北平的當局很希望他們能早些走，免得多惹是非！不願走的到是她們，因爲她們在前綫答應過守土將士們，説是回到北平以後，一定靠演戲來籌些欵子買東西來送給他們，爲了守信，也爲了爭取演劇自由起見，因之她們在没有把戲演出之前，便不肯走，而一方面呢，從間接直接得來的消息和忠告，都勸她們還是不演爲妙，在這樣情勢下，差不多僵持了一個月，後來總算在本月一號晚上，在燕京大學演出了四個戲，（一）漢奸的子孫；（二）女記者；（三）棄兒；（四）黎明；觀衆有一千多人，演出的成績也很好，所以同情她們的對她們的印象更好了。</p>
<p>在前綫，她們演過「放下你的鞭子」「張家店」「走私」等三個戲，另外還有歌唱和演説，這些成績全都很好，把兵士們感動得流淚和大呌便是明證。她們從上海出發的原祇十個人，但因爲沿途都有加入她們隊伍的，所以到前綫去是一共有三十九人，她們在歸綏住了二天，百靈廟住了二天，另外在平地泉也住了一天，加之路上躭擱的辰光，一共大概在一星期左右，在這一星期裏，她們雖然受着凍，在肉體上很受了些苦，但在精神上，却是挺痛快的，她們盡了一部份做國民的責任，而盡了責任的她們，還是平素爲大人先生們所瞧不起的所謂弱不禁風和「難養」的「女子」。</p>
<p>關於陳波兒以後的出路問題，因爲前幾天報上曾經有提到她向明星當局辭職的消息，所以連帶的問到了她，她説：「我剛從北平回來，上海的情形怎樣了，我不大熟悉，至於辭職的事情，則並没有逼會事，脱離明星則更没有，因爲我跟明星是有合同的」。</p>
<p>最後，還是再讓我回過頭來説：昨晨去歡迎她的人們吧。因爲來得很突然，各方面知道的太少，連通知都來不及，所以昨晨到車站去的，除各報的記者之外，就祇有季小姐等三位，另外，則是她的丈夫和她的孩子任克。</p>
<h3>大力士百克門</h3>
<p>卡爾登自百克門羣芳會後，各界對於大力士百克門，咸表驚奇，百氏除全身肌肉能運氣至任何部份隨音樂而跳動外，尚能以在一輛，重三百磅，上載三人以背上兩肌肉夾着車柄，拉之緩行，更站立以八角台上，手舉木盤上有男女十餘人坐立其間，以頭頂而用兩手托之，並用電力而轉動此八角台，使觀者洞悉其前後均無痕跡假借，其武功殊屬不易記者爲明瞭百氏本身歷史起見，昨由該團華經理周聖才君之介紹，得晤於後台。</p>
<p>百氏係臘泰維亞人，今年已四十一歳，十六歳以前身體衰弱，自感痛苦，遂加入理搿體育會，經一年之苦心努力，身體轉强，前後判若兩人，是年得該會舉重第一名，三年後，在德國得舉重錦標，一九二五年得世界舉重第三名，其最高紀錄，兩手可三百。六磅，右手二百十磅，能連舉三下，而其頭部可受千磅以上重量，爲常人所不及者，其武技除連演表演之肌肉跳動，肌肉拉重，舉重外，尚能以鐵鈎，夾於背脊肌肉上吊空中，脚下復可吊三四人之重量，更有以粗如銀圓之鐵條棍，在手中盤玩如麵條，並可左右肩挑二十餘人，行之泰然，等等，其武功可見一斑。</p>
<p>百氏並使記者明悉肌肉拉重之情况，常塲由七人站立在上，作實地試騐，記者亦身臨其間，絲毫無夾，至其肌肉之跳動，實是操於一種神經感覺，且須於柔軟體操與機械運動並進，操練以恒，日久方克成功，至其頭部至少可有二千磅重量，故舉十餘人並非難事，百氏遂領導參觀其八角台，此台後有一小門，內有一盤，百氏站立其中，用電力上升，惟上下殊緩，須廿餘分鐘之多，故表演時，時間不能過久也。</p>
<p>百氏年正半百而貌尚如二十許人，狀態粗魯，多髭，黄髮中秃，實常以頭部演技之故，生平未結婚，尚係處男，對於性慾，已無感覺，有一兄，已故，平日注意於筋骨訓練，每日平均在六小時上，睡眠則規定至少八小時，睡時，不許任何人入內，不閉窗，蓋愛作郊外生活所致，拚棄烟酒，食蔬菜，不食肉類，故其固精運氣保元之陽方克至此。</p>
<p>百氏復言：最近擬刋登廣告，滬上如有人能表演其武功與其任何部份相同者，願酬金五千元，半數送入慈善團體，希望各界前往比賽，决無食言。</p>
<p>百氏前年曾隨海京伯馬戲班來滬，隨後返德，近在德國組織歌舞班，以己名爲團名，沿途聘請各國名優，全體一行七十餘人，由德直接來滬，在上月廿五號獻技以來，頗盛一時，明日起將爲各團體義務表演數日，實爲期無多，臨行匆匆，聊表雅意耳。百氏與記者握别，並贈其近影多幀，以留紀念。</p>

<h3>Silver Stored in Shanghai Branch of Bank of Japan Should Be Handed Over to Our Country</h3>
<p>—Advocacy of Kodama and Others— Tokyo Observes Sino-Japanese Cotton Industry Cooperation as Important Mission of Kodama and Others’ Trip</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to today's Chugai Business News, although Kodama Kenji and his delegation are said to be visiting China for reciprocal visits and to attend the Sino-Japanese Trade Association General Assembly held in Shanghai, and therefore did not bring any specific plans, they are paying close attention to the question of whether general cooperation on the cotton industry and cotton planting can be successful. This is because the cotton issue is actually the key to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Regarding this matter, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the Japan Textile Association, and the Japan Textile Industry Association in China have exchanged opinions several times, and thorough preparations have been made in various aspects. The reason why three cotton industry representatives have joined this trip is precisely because of this. Therefore, cotton industry cooperation is truly an important mission of this trip, and it is hoped that the upcoming Sino-Japanese Joint Association will discuss specific policies for cooperation. The newspaper continued that improvements in cotton seeds and increased cotton yields must also be noted. Regarding this matter, Japanese officials have already consulted with the Chinese Cotton Industry Control Commission several times. According to another source, Prime Minister Hayashi Senjuro of Japan hosted a farewell banquet for Kodama and his delegation last night, during which Kodama and others exchanged specific views with Prime Minister Hayashi and the Army and Navy Ministers. Many people advocated that the silver stored in the Shanghai branch of the Bank of Japan should be handed over to China. It is particularly important to recall that since China implemented currency reform, all foreign banks have handed over silver to China, but the Bank of Japan has not yet handed it over. It is reported here that the amount of silver held by the Bank of Japan is only nine million yen. Regarding this issue, no decision has yet been made, but there is still room for further consideration. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>French Correspondence</p>
<h3>The White-Hot Military Expansion of Germany and France (1)</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ke</p>
<p>Since January 30, 1933, when Hitler, backed by the power of the Nazi Party, seized political power in Germany, Germany has gradually abandoned the unequal Treaty of Versailles and resumed military buildup. On March 7th of last year, Germany violated the Treaty of Locarno and marched into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. As a result, France had to mobilize its troops and station them day and night in the Maginot Line tunnels for defense. It is said that the Maginot Line is about 50 meters deep and fully mechanized internally. It is said that from a distance, it seems like nothing, but as soon as enemy troops approach, machine guns and cannons will emerge from the ground. In terms of the strictness of defense, it is no exaggeration to say that even birds cannot fly over it. German military experts generally believe that the next war will benefit from speed, launching a surprise attack, destroying everything of the enemy in a short time, and then achieving victory. No wonder France is particularly cautious in its defense of the Rhineland, striving for utmost thoroughness. In addition to regularly stationed troops, the Maginot Line, fearing that it would not be able to resupply in time once war breaks out, concentrates healthy residents of nearby villages in the line every week to familiarize themselves with the use of machinery, the location of military equipment storage, etc., so as to avoid panic and delays in an emergency. In order to increase the efficiency of mobilization during wartime, the French military authorities have also pre-stored all uniforms, firearms, and equipment for reserve troops in designated locations, so that they do not need to go to the barracks to concentrate and prepare everything when war breaks out, which can avoid wasting time, and only need to go directly to the designated location.</p>
<p>Since Hitler expanded his military and actively violated various international treaties, international relations in Europe have been extremely tense. The conclusion of the so-called New Locarno Pact had long been publicized internationally, but due to changes in the European political situation, Germany and Italy approached each other due to the resolution of the Austrian issue, and their foreign policies seemed to be highly consistent, using this to coerce Britain and France. Furthermore, due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and the surge of Fascist forces, the New Locarno Conference was repeatedly postponed and is now indefinitely delayed.</p>
<p>Little did people know that one wave subsides internationally, and another rises. When Hitler was relaxing in his Borchtesgaden villa, contemplating the snow-capped Alps, he was considering his world-shaking plan, which was announced on August 26th of last year, extending the mandatory military service period from one year to two years. As a result, the number of German standing army troops, since last October, must have exceeded at least 1.2 million. (Before the extension of the military service period, it was about 800,000, of which soldiers of the 1914 class accounted for 450,000, and the other 350,000 were professional soldiers. The 1935 class was the first year with the most severe shortage of soldiers during the war, but there were still 300,000 to 400,000 people, plus 200,000 to 250,000 policemen undergoing military training at the same time, totaling up to 1.5 million people.) The severity of Germany's extension of the military service period to France is self-evident. The number of standing army troops in France is only 400,000 (including 80,000 professional soldiers). Last spring, the French government also requested the parliament to temporarily extend the military service period to two years due to the lack of conscripts in the 1915 class in order to maintain the number of standing army troops. Therefore, after the news of Germany's military expansion spread, French Prime Minister Leon Blum and Minister of National Defense Daladier immediately convened the General Staff for a joint meeting to discuss countermeasures. As a result, there are only two ways to deal with the threat of German force: first, extend military service to two and a half or three years. This method is considered too costly and unpopular with the people, and there is no possibility of implementation. The second method is to strengthen the mechanization of military equipment. Therefore, it was decided to increase its effectiveness in terms of both the quality and quantity of military equipment.</p>

<h3>Consistency in Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>On the same day that the new Japanese Foreign Minister Sato held his inaugural ceremony in Tokyo, the National Government, based on the decision of the Central Political Council, announced that Dr. Yu Longhui would be the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Japan and China both have new foreign ministers at the same time. At a time when Sino-Japanese relations have become the focus of the world's attention, changes in the future foreign policies of China and Japan will naturally cause various speculations and assumptions. However, the rise and fall of personnel has little to do with the basic foreign policy of a country. Dr. Yu Longhui issued a statement on the 4th, saying that future foreign policy should continue to advance based on the central government's established policies and the principles declared by the central authorities after the Fifth Plenary Session. Sato announced in the Diet that a country's foreign policy should not be changed frequently but should maintain some continuity. We believe that a foreign policy is based on the two factors of the country's needs and the international environment. If these two factors do not change, the change of personnel in charge of foreign affairs has a very subtle impact.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Chinese government's exercise of foreign affairs powers has gradually formed a fixed system. The Kuomintang's foreign policy has a certain path after being expounded by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the leaders of the party and the country and announced by the supreme meetings of the past. In particular, the recent Third Plenary Session made a correct decision on the policy that should be adopted in Sino-Japanese diplomacy. And this decision, the Chinese people, expressed deep sympathy. The duties of the Minister of Foreign Affairs are to handle international relations and all matters related to overseas Chinese, foreign residents, and Sino-foreign commerce, etc. The final decision-making power of foreign policy lies with the Chinese Kuomintang. Because the current Provisional Constitution stipulates that the central ruling power is exercised by the Chinese Kuomintang. Therefore, the Central Political Council of the Kuomintang is actually the supreme power organ that decides foreign policy and supervises foreign administration. This agency is responsible to the Central Executive Committee itself. And the National Government is responsible to the Central Political Council, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is just a branch of the National Government.</p>
<p>Moreover, all parts of the National Government are responsible for supervising and controlling the implementation of foreign policy. As far as the Executive Yuan is concerned, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is directly responsible to the President of the Yuan. The minister is only a subordinate of the President of the Yuan. Now that the President of the Yuan has not changed, there is naturally no question of a change in foreign policy. Secondly, the Legislative Yuan also has considerable control over foreign affairs power. According to the provisions of the National Government Organization Law, the power to decide on declarations of war, peace talks, and other important international matters lies with the Legislative Yuan. All international agreements and treaties that fall within the scope of the Legislative Yuan must be resolved and announced by the Legislative Yuan, otherwise, the Legislative Yuan has the responsibility to raise inquiries. As for the Supervisory Yuan's supervision of foreign affairs power, it is even more obvious. Because the Supervisory Yuan is the highest supervisory organ, if the Minister of Foreign Affairs has any illegal or dereliction of duty, he can of course be impeached. When the Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed the Sino-Japanese Shanghai Truce Agreement in the twenty-first year, the Minister of Foreign Affairs was impeached by the Supervisory Yuan, which is a clear example.</p>
<p>Therefore, the change of the Minister of Foreign Affairs has no great relationship with the direction of foreign policy. We hope that the government will maintain the consistency of diplomacy. We hope that the new Minister of Foreign Affairs will work hard with the aim of national self-preservation and international equality, using the opportunities of the times.</p>
<h3>Western Powers Reach Compromise on Supervision Plan</h3>
<p>Portugal Makes Three Concessions to Russia, Details Pending Discussion; Implementation Expected This Saturday After Assembly Approval</p>
<p>(London) The Non-Intervention Committee, which is responsible for drafting the final details of the plan to monitor the Spanish coast and borders, met for ten hours yesterday and reached an agreement late at night on all issues concerning the implementation of the monitoring plan. The entire committee will be asked to meet on Monday to accept the recommendations of the subcommittee so that the first phase of the land and sea monitoring plan can be implemented immediately. The subcommittee spent a long time considering the report submitted by the naval experts' special meeting on the naval monitoring plan. According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Times, it now appears that Dutch Vice Admiral Graff will be appointed as the administrator of the joint land and sea monitoring plan. According to the monitoring plan, an international office will be set up to implement monitoring on behalf of the 27 countries, and the chairman will be elected by the Non-Intervention Committee. The remaining representatives will be selected by the governments of the five countries of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia. A total of 500 monitors are needed for the Spanish coast, 130 British monitors are stationed on the Spanish-Portuguese border, 130 international monitors are stationed on the French-Spanish border, and 5 monitors are stationed on the Gibraltar-Spanish border. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch dated the 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee has decided that the implementation of the Spanish land and sea border monitoring plan should be postponed to the 13th of this month. (Originally scheduled to start at midnight today) (Central News Agency Havas dispatch dated the 6th)</p>
<p>(London) The subcommittee of the Committee on Adjustment of the Spanish Civil War met at 3:30 PM yesterday and did not disperse until 11:00 PM. It reached an agreement in principle on the Spanish land and sea border monitoring plan and completely revised a method of establishing an international agreement by participating countries. The content is: ㊀ Participating countries agree to send warships to designated locations, ensuring that they arrive on the 13th of this month. The land border monitors should also go to the designated locations on the same day. ㊁ The entire monitoring plan must be effectively implemented only after the maritime monitors (i.e., those who implement monitoring on ships sailing to Spain in various countries' seaports) arrive at the designated locations and are able to perform their duties. In addition, the subcommittee has determined to appoint former Chief of Staff of the Dutch Navy, Admiral Graff, as the Director of the London General Office, British Vice Admiral Yue Lifu as the Director of Sea Monitoring, and Dutch Colonel Lunen as the Director of Monitoring on the French-Spanish border of the Pyrenees. The Adjustment Committee is scheduled to hold a plenary meeting on the 8th of this month to approve the above monitoring plan. However, there are still three details that must be approved by the governments of the Soviet Union, France, and Germany before they can take effect. Therefore, it is still uncertain whether the plenary meeting can approve it at that time. The three details are: ㊀ the monitoring of the Canary Islands of Western Spain (now in the hands of the Nationalist Army), ㊁ the tonnage tax that should be paid by all ships under monitoring should be paid by the General Office instead of being borne by the shipowners, ㊂ the monitoring costs that should be borne by each country should be paid in currencies other than marks. Furthermore, the implementation of monitoring on ships leaving the League and sailing to various ports in Western Spain is the focus of the dispute between Portugal and the Soviet Union, and it is also a major difficulty for the subcommittee. Portugal opposes the implementation of monitoring in Lisbon and Madeira because it does not want Soviet ships to anchor in those ports. The Soviet Union has protested this. After Portugal expressed concessions, the Soviet Union withdrew its protest, and finally, Lisbon and Madeira were used as monitoring locations according to the original plan. According to the situation of the subcommittee's meeting yesterday, it was very strange that many ambassadors used long-distance telephones in the conference room to ask for instructions from their respective governments. This is unprecedented. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch dated the 7th)</p>
<h3>Argentine Embassy to Spain Moves to Valencia</h3>
<p>⊙Madrid After the Argentine government moved its embassy to the city of Valencia, the current Chargé d'Affaires, Urdasar, will be promoted to Ambassador and will go to Paris soon, and then to Valencia to take up his new post. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Army Concentrates Forces to Prepare for a Major Offensive</h3>
<p>Artillery Battles Occur in the Western Suburbs of the Capital; Government Orders Unification of Military Power</p>
<p>⊙Madrid Our correspondent Roling reports that the Nationalist Army is now concentrating large numbers of soldiers in the area around the Kalama River in the southeast of the capital and the area around El Bardo in the northwest. Moradat, a town near the Kalama River, is particularly heavily fortified. A major offensive is expected to launch at any moment. The offensive is roughly divided into two routes: one route is on the south side of the capital, attacking the highway from Madrid to Valencia, and the other route starts from the towns of Las Rozas and El Plantivo in the northwest and attacks the capital. The government army artillery units launched a fierce bombardment on the rear of the Nationalist Army positions this morning, intending to prevent them from concentrating. The Nationalist Army immediately returned fire, and the artillery battle lasted until the afternoon. In addition, twelve strike aircraft of the Nationalist Army also bombed the government army positions in the morning, but were quickly forced to retreat. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch dated the 6th)</p>
<p>⊙Valencia The Kalama front line seems to be about to have a decisive battle. It is rumored that General Lano, the commander of the Nationalist Army who captured Malaga, is now concentrating his troops in an attempt to launch a major offensive and control the main road from Madrid to Valencia. Therefore, the government army launched a fierce bombardment with artillery at dawn, which lasted for four hours. The Nationalist Army also returned fire after one hour of fighting. At that time, twelve Nationalist Army bombers, assisted by several fighter planes, bombed the government army positions. Before long, the government army planes took off to fight, and the enemy planes retreated. At the same time, the Spanish government has ordered the merger of foreign volunteers and Republican volunteers in the government army's telegram to unify military power. From then on, the international brigades will no longer operate independently under the command of their commanders. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch dated the 6th)</p>
<p>⊙Madrid Before midnight last night, the rebel army launched a fierce offensive on the front line of the University City, attempting to seize El Bardo. At the same time, a wall of the hospital building suddenly collapsed, causing a squad of rebel soldiers to be crushed to death and creating a 165-yard gap in the rebel army's encirclement line around the capital. Today, the rebel army issued a communiqué in Talafanla, denying that the government army had reached the outskirts of Toledo. The government army headquarters ordered the requisition of all civilian gas masks for the use of the troops defending the capital, and ordered special vigilance on the central front line to prevent the rebel army from launching a general offensive. It is reported that 25,000 troops who will launch a general offensive on the capital will arrive one after another. (National Telegram dated the 6th)</p>
<h3>Twelve Italian Divisions Preparing to Go to Spain to Assist in the War</h3>
<p>News Reported by French Newspapers</p>
<p>(Paris) After the subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War decided to postpone the implementation of the Spanish land and sea border monitoring plan to the +3rd of this month, some newspapers here were deeply concerned that Italy might send troops to Spain before the sea monitoring plan is implemented. The Business Daily published an article by Mrs. Tabui, which briefly stated, "The Italian Army has four corps, each corps has three divisions, and they are now preparing to depart. The country is doing its utmost to assist the Spanish Nationalist Army, which is the most intense this time. This news comes from an eyewitness, the same person who reported three months ago that Italy sent 60,000 troops to Spain (which has now been proven to be true)."

<p>Mechanized Army to Increase to Four Divisions; Total of 2,500 Tanks</p>
<p>(London) The Times correspondent in Berlin recently stated that Germany may add one more division of mechanized troops, bringing the total to four divisions, and add two artillery regiments. Each division of mechanized troops has two tank regiments, totaling 500 tanks. The original three divisions already have as many as 1,500 tanks. In addition, each division also has a reconnaissance armored vehicle team, an artillery regiment, and a mechanized cavalry regiment. Each division can advance 16 kilometers per hour.

<h3>Hungary's Right-Wing Coup Plot Discovered</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Handles Situation Effectively; Suppresses the Disorder Before It Takes Shape</p>
<p>⊙Budapest Although the official has not confirmed the joint uprising of far-right groups in Hungary, the huge changes in the political situation are almost inevitable. Fortunately, Prime Minister Darányi handled the situation effectively and was able to contain it. In Hungary, there are recently the National Socialist Arrow Cross Group, the Sickle Cross Group, the Nationalist Group, the Turul Group, and the Movement Group, all of which are far-right groups that have planned unrest, attempted to seize power, and received financial support from a certain country. The government authorities were aware of this and have repeatedly consulted and decided on measures to maintain law and order and stop it. Prime Minister Darányi also delivered a speech to the National Unity Party in this city yesterday, stating that "Regardless of whether it is internal or external, adventurous actions are not allowed. The government has decided to maintain law and order and has the strength to do so." In addition, the Hungarian Police Commissioner Ferenc resigned at this time, and the German Minister to Hungary, Macgansen, also left Budapest at the same time to travel to Greece.

<p>⊙Budapest Although the racist Movement Group's plot to launch a coup has been discovered, its secrets have not yet been fully revealed. In general, this conspiracy is still brewing, but the measures taken by the authorities to quell the unrest are also kept secret. What is known is that Police Commissioner Ferencz has resigned, and his confidant Hedeny will probably also resign. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch dated the 6th)</p>
<h3>Nazi Party Dominates Danzig City Council</h3>
<p>⊙Free City of Danzig The Social Democratic councilor of the Free City Council, Brier, was recently arrested by the Nazi authorities of this city and detained for a long time. He has just been released, but he has been forced to give up his seat and sign a declaration allowing him not to engage in political activities again. His vacated seat will be taken over by the Nazi Party member Grossman. Currently, the Nazi Party occupies 46 of the 72 councilors in the city council, which is close to the statutory two-thirds, namely 48 seats. Once this number is reached, the constitution of the Free City can be amended legally. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch dated the 6th)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Diet Session Is Expected to Pass Peacefully; The Foundation of the Hayashi Cabinet Is Solid</h3>
<p>Budget Bill Expected to Pass the House of Representatives Today; Confrontational Situation Between Political Parties and the Military Eases</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's unprecedentedly huge budget, estimated at approximately 2.8 billion yen, was approved yesterday by the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives. Except for an increase in subsidies to local governments, the original proposal was not modified. This was the expected result and is not surprising. Although the Seiyukai and Minseito parties attached a joint warning of four points, this move was only to maintain the face of the political parties. As for the movement to reform policies, the political parties themselves are full of sores and carbuncles and have no ability to fight again. After the adjournment of the Diet, the injury will become even more serious. The Social Masses Party and the Toho Society fundamentally opposed the budget, but the views of the two parties differed. The former opposed it because of the huge military expenditure and tax increase plans, which increased the pressure on the people, while the latter opposed it because the current budget could not fully express the policies of the Hayashi Cabinet. Now that the budget has been approved by the Budget Committee, it should soon be safely passed by the plenary session of the House of Representatives. After it is approved by the House of Representatives, it seems that it will not encounter much opposition in the House of Peers. Therefore, there is no doubt that this session of the Diet will be able to adjourn at the end of March without any waves. The future political trend depends on the development of various forces after the end of the Diet's work. At present, the foundation of the Hayashi Cabinet seems to be more solid than when the cabinet was first formed, but there are still many internal contradictions. It is doubtful whether the cabinet can completely overcome the difficulties. The political development after the adjournment of the Diet will definitely be more noteworthy and more important than the political trend during the Diet session.

<h3>Premier Hayashi Discusses Future Measures</h3>
<p>Reforming Administrative Organs is Imperative; No Need to Imitate British Party Politics</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The budget for the Showa 12th year has already been decided upon by the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 6th and is expected to pass the House of Representatives safely on the 8th before being sent to the House of Peers. It is now certain that the Hayashi Cabinet will overcome the difficulties in this session of parliament. Premier Hayashi discussed the government's future policy at his official residence last night, as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ The Minister of Education Issue: We are seeking a full-time Minister of Education promptly, but after much consideration, we have not yet found a suitable candidate. Whether we should seek someone from academia or any other field is not restricted. We plan to find someone who is suitable for the cabinet. A decision should be made soon.</p>
<p>㊁ The Full-Time Issue for Ministers of Railways and Colonial Affairs: The full-time appointment of the Ministers of Railways and Colonial Affairs is related to the issue of reforming administrative organizations. Whether to proceed with this again has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>㊂ The Issue of Administrative Organization Reform: Reforming administrative organizations is planned to be implemented after consultation with key personnel. Whether to handle this matter through the current Investigation Bureau or whether to expand the functions of the Investigation Bureau is being considered. As for whether a so-called General Affairs Agency is necessary, it is currently under study. The previous cabinet's plan for a General Affairs Agency emphasized managing personnel and budget matters, but it created an overly powerful situation, which has its drawbacks. Therefore, careful consideration is needed. While the organization of an Economic Planning Headquarters is necessary, whether it should be a key department or a larger-scale organization is being considered.</p>
<p>㊃ Working with Political Parties: When I formed the cabinet, the confrontational state between political parties and the military was quite sharp. Even selecting cabinet members required them to leave their parties. However, recently, both sides have reached a point of mutual reflection, so the relationship between the two sides seems to have eased somewhat. I believe that there is no hindrance if it is a political party that is not biased towards party interests, but I do not think that the party politics of Britain, where the two major parties control power, is necessary. There is no need to immediately apply foreign-style politics to Japan because Japan has its own unique politics.</p>
<p>㊄ Extraordinary Session of Parliament: This parliamentary session does not have time to promote the realization of the unique policies of the current cabinet, so it may be possible to convene an extraordinary session of parliament. The ministers of each ministry are currently studying appropriate plans, but because the next parliamentary session is being held early, it is not yet possible to predict whether preparations can be made properly.</p>
<p>㊅ Policy Issues: Establishing an industrial plan that corresponds to the national defense plan is an urgent issue. It is also necessary to have thorough policies on price controls and stabilizing the lives of the people.</p>
<p>Issues such as increasing the salaries of lower-level officials are also issues that should be considered, but due to financial considerations, it is necessary to listen to the opinions of the Minister of Finance to study them. (Kyodo News, 7th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Women's Association Invites Madame Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>A Joyful Meeting in May</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This year marks the 20th anniversary of Madame Chiang Kai-shek (Soong Mei-ling)'s graduation from Wellesley College in the United States. The university deeply admires Madame Chiang's courageous act of personally saving her husband during the Xi'an Incident and has awarded her an honorary doctorate in philosophy. The presentation ceremony is scheduled to be held in June this year. The Tokyo United Women's Association learned of this and, led by Chairman Yayoi Yoshioka and Hideko Inoue, plans to invite Madame Chiang Kai-shek to land in Japan on her way to the United States, where the association will host her in the hope of clarifying Sino-Japanese relations. On the 3rd of this month, they entrusted Ms. Ikuko Shimizu, a member in China, to deliver the invitation to Madame Chiang. The invitation praised Madame Chiang's actions and stated that women across Japan eagerly look forward to meeting her and requested that she stop over in Japan on her way to the United States. The Women's Association is now awaiting Madame Chiang's good news and expects to welcome Madame Chiang Kai-shek to Japan in May for a joyful Sino-Japanese exchange. (Kyodo News, 7th)</p>

<h3>France Implements Financial Policies, Urges People to Cooperate</h3>
<p>Premier's Radio Address Clarifies Significance; National Defense Bonds Scheduled for Issue This Wednesday</p>
<p>(Paris) The national defense bonds to be issued by the government will begin to be issued on Wednesday (the 10th). All departments under the Ministry of Finance are spending today organizing the regulations for these bonds, which are expected to be announced around the morning of the 9th so that the public is fully informed. (Central News Agency, Geneva, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Premier Léon Blum gave a radio address tonight explaining the significance of the financial measures taken by the government yesterday and calling on the people of the country to enthusiastically contribute by purchasing national defense bonds. The following is an excerpt of the speech: The Premier first stated that although the financial situation of France, as described by French and foreign figures, is grim, it is necessary to pay serious attention to this matter. If we adopt superficial methods of treating the symptom rather than the cause, many malpractices will result. It is necessary to address the root cause for a permanent solution. The purpose of the financial measures taken by the government this time is to do just that. The main reasons for France's financial difficulties are two: one is due to the economic panic, and the other is due to the tension in the international situation. The government's proposed solution is to use effective means to resolve these two difficulties, improve the economic situation, and hope for a revival of public finance. The recovery of the French economy has already begun to show signs, but the recovery of public finance alone is slow. This is not surprising. Those who do not understand this believe that France's financial situation is on the verge of collapse and are deeply concerned that the government will take extreme measures, such as devaluing the currency again or managing foreign exchange. They even express doubts about whether the national treasury can meet its debts. The people lack confidence in the government's finances, and as a result, capital flows out, and foreign exchange speculation becomes a trend. From this, it can be seen that financial difficulties directly affect the stability of the currency. This is why the government, in order to treat the root cause, must simultaneously consider the financial situation and the currency situation.</p>
<p>As far as France's financial situation is concerned, it is sufficient to meet its debts and there is no fear of exhaustion. The total amount of the national treasury's deficit is about 360 billion francs, plus the British loan of 40 billion francs (i.e., the 40 million pounds loaned by the twelve London railway companies to France, which is equivalent to the above amount in francs), for a total of 400 billion francs. However, since January of this year, the government has already repaid 80 billion francs, and the remaining deficit is no more than 320 billion francs. The government has now decided to reduce various temporary expenditures by 60 billion francs, leaving a deficit of 260 billion francs. Part of this amount is due to railway losses, which should gradually decrease in the future. For this reason, even if the tax situation is at its worst, the amount of the deficit will not exceed the total amount of the government's revenue. Moreover, 50 percent of the final remaining deficit (260 billion francs) is for temporary expenditures for national defense funds. Therefore, the government has decided to issue a large number of national defense bonds to inject funds. These bonds will be issued within days, with denominations in francs, dollars, and pounds, representing the currencies of the three signatory countries of the Anglo-American-French Currency Agreement. Therefore, the bondholders can be protected, and even if the exchange rates between the three countries fluctuate, there is no risk of loss. Those French people who export funds abroad do so only to avoid the risk of the franc falling in value. Now the national defense bonds are available in francs, dollars, and pounds, allowing people to choose, so there is protection against the risk of currency devaluation, both now and in the future. Those who have funds abroad will not be able to find an excuse to refuse to buy the bonds. For this reason, the government expects that after the issuance of the national defense bonds, a large amount of exported funds can return to the country. If so, the foreign exchange market will change its original situation. To achieve this goal, the government has decided that from now on, the import and sale of gold will be free. (According to previous regulations, people who had cash in the country or abroad had to report it to the government, and the government would extract the value increased by the franc's devaluation. This measure will be abolished in the future.) In addition, Premier Blum repeatedly stated that the government has decided to abide by the Anglo-American-French Currency Agreement and that all mandatory measures, such as the foreign exchange management system, should be avoided.</p>
<p>The second part of the Premier's speech concerned the reduction of government spending, stating that the total reduction amounted to 60 billion francs, which would be reduced from various temporary expenditures such as national defense expenditures, public works expenditures, subsidies to local governments, subsidies to several railway companies, and construction expenditures of various post offices. Other parts of the budget have not been changed, and all public works that have already begun must be completed and will never be abandoned. Finally, the Premier stated that the main purpose of the government's decision yesterday was to make the funds flowing out of the country return to the country. Therefore, the government must create various situations so that the return of capital to the country can obtain benefits. In addition, the government should take all possible measures to prevent the outflow of funds, but all mandatory measures, such as foreign exchange management, should be avoided because these measures are contrary to France's foreign policy. He also said that the government's past achievements have strengthened domestic and international peace and restored the economy, which is the only way to reduce government spending. His conclusion was: "We do not want to engage in war again. At this time, what we are calling for is to concentrate the power of the whole country. The government that is issuing this call to the whole country today is worthy of the trust of the people and is not ashamed. This is what I dare to say." (Central News Agency, Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>French Government Rushing to Draft Bills</h3>
<p>Requesting Congressional Authorization to Issue National Defense Bonds</p>
<p>(Paris) Rumors have it that the total amount of French national defense bonds will be 100 billion francs, with a fixed interest rate of 4%. It was originally scheduled to be issued tomorrow, but due to legal issues, it will be changed to Wednesday. The government feels it is necessary to ask Congress to approve the amendment to the financial law passed last October, so it is rushing to draft bills to submit to the Senate and the House of Representatives for approval so that the government's decisions can take effect. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The government is now scheduled to submit a bill to the House of Representatives on Tuesday (the 9th of this month) requesting authorization to issue national defense bonds, along with a foreign exchange guarantee (referring to the fact that the bond is denominated in francs, pounds, and dollars, and that the principal of the pound and dollar bonds will be converted into francs at the exchange rate of the pound and dollar against the franc at the time of repayment). The House Finance Committee will meet on Tuesday morning to review the bill, and the Senate Finance Committee will meet on the same day in the afternoon to review it so that the government can issue the bonds on Tuesday (the 10th of this month). According to sources responsible, Finance Minister Olivoir discussed the issuance of bonds from a legal perspective with Roueff, a member of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, and Alex, the dean of the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris, this morning, and discovered several difficulties that should be resolved. In addition, the government will also ask the House of Representatives to authorize the government to: ㊀ denominate the bonds in francs, pounds, and dollars; ㊁ modify the system of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund (referring to expanding the organization and ordering it to monitor the domestic bond market). Finally, the government will submit an amendment to the currency law to abolish the provisions prohibiting the sale and purchase of gold and ordering people to report their gold holdings. It is learned that when the House Finance Committee meets to review the National Defense Bond Bill, Finance Minister Olivoir will personally attend to explain it and submit a report on the state of the Treasury's revenue and expenditure, pointing out that the Treasury's revenue is the lowest in February each year, but the revenue in February of this year was actually higher than the budget figure. Regarding the issue of national defense bonds, most members in the House of Representatives lounge believe that the bill proposed by the government will definitely be passed, and the issuance of the bonds will also be satisfactory. Premier Léon Blum, Defense Minister Daladier, and Interior Minister Tourmo have recently jointly issued an order to the governors of all provinces across the country to organize committees within their borders. All members of the organization, regardless of political affiliation, as well as members of provincial and municipal councils, civil and military officials, and representatives of business associations, should be ordered to join the committee to jointly study various methods of selling national defense bonds to observe their success.

<h3>Rumor of Understanding Reached Between the U.S. and France</h3>
<p>Allowing Americans to Invest in France Does Not Contradict the Johnson Act; French Ambassador Visits U.S. Treasury Secretary</p>
<p>(Paris) Unofficial sources here said today that U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau has reached an understanding with French Premier Blum to allow U.S. banks to invest in French national defense bonds, which will not contradict the U.S. Johnson Act prohibiting loans to countries in default. It is understood that if French bonds are repaid in U.S. dollars or British pounds, the U.S. government will not object to banks notifying customers to purchase them, but banks may not purchase them directly. Experts here believe that if Americans automatically remit their private funds to Paris to purchase French bonds, of course, they cannot be prohibited. It is likely that Britain will also introduce France's national defense loan as an attractive investment. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(New York) The banking community here today is skeptical about the rumor that the Treasury Department has reached an understanding with France to allow Americans to purchase French national defense bonds, but said that the Johnson Act only prohibits countries in default of U.S. debts from issuing bonds in the United States.

<h3>Austrian Monarchists Hold Demonstration</h3>
<p>Hosted by the Legitimist Front; Two Cabinet Members Participate</p>
<p>(Vienna) The monarchists recently held a large-scale demonstration at the Ernst Circus, which was hosted by the "Legitimist Front," composed of Austrian soldiers. The venue was packed with people, and two cabinet members also attended: General Hulget, the State Counselor, and Rote, the Deputy Minister. Stainning, the leader of the "Legitimist Front," insisted that the Austrian people should have the right to advocate for the restoration of the monarchy.

<h3>U.S.-Canada Talks</h3>
<p>—Details Unknown— Summoning a World Economic Conference; Beret Explores President's Intentions</p>
<p>(Washington) Canadian Prime Minister King arrived here yesterday and held talks with President Roosevelt, which have now concluded. The U.S. government has not issued a press release on these talks. It is reported that matters of mutual interest to both Canada and the U.S. were discussed. At the same time, it is widely rumored that U.S. Ambassador to France Beret has returned here from France and plans to inform President Roosevelt whether to send officials through diplomatic channels to inquire about the opinions of various countries on summoning a world economic and disarmament conference. This rumor has not been confirmed by officials. According to the opinions of well-informed sources, Beret's trip is related to his speech before leaving Paris, in which he said that the United States is prepared to participate in future trade and disarmament conferences. Since the New York Times published a report that President Roosevelt is considering inviting the rulers of the world to attend a conference, people still believe that President Roosevelt will take this action soon after the general election. However, no matter what proposals are made, it is doubtful whether President Roosevelt will consider carrying out this work at a time when the Supreme Court battle is imminent. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>Military and Police on High Alert: Liu Lurui Escorted to Wuchang</h3>
<p>Temporarily Held in the First Prison with Great Courtesy; Higher Court to Commence Trial Soon; Cheng Bianchao Awaiting Confrontation, Not Yet Executed</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Central Committee member Liu Lurui, implicated in the Tang Youren and Yang Yongtai case, was arrested by the Shanghai Public Concession police on the 24th of last month. After a ruling by the First Special District Court, he was handed over to the Hubei Higher Court for trial. The Chief Prosecutor of the court, Lu Shizeng, specially appointed Prosecutor Zhang Fusen to lead over a dozen police officers to Shanghai to escort him back. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, they escorted Liu onto the China Merchants Bureau's Jiang'an steamer to be transported to Hubei. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau also dispatched eleven police officers, including Yang Fulin and Xue Yuewu, to accompany and transfer him. Zhang then returned to Hubei by plane on the 3rd to report the details of the escort to Chief Prosecutor Lu. Meanwhile, arrangements were made at the First Prison Detention Center as a temporary detention place for Liu. The Jiang'an steamer passed Nanjing on the 3rd, Wuhu on the 4th, and Jiujiang at 3:00 AM on the 5th, arriving at Pier No. 3 of the China Merchants Bureau in Hankou at 4:30 PM. In advance, the Wuhan Garrison Brigade's Seventh Regiment of Military Police, police officers from the Sixth Branch of the Municipal Police, inspectors from the Inspection Office, detectives from the Detective Team, and detectives and police from the Higher Court were assigned to be on guard and take care of matters. The riverbank was also cordoned off. After the Jiang'an steamer docked, passengers on board were not allowed to disembark. The Military Affairs Ministry's Huan'an chartered steamer immediately approached and docked to the left of the Jiang'an steamer. The Maritime Public Security Bureau dispatched patrol boats to patrol the river surface. Liu, wearing a blue-gray sheepskin robe and leather shoes, slowly walked out of the dining hall and directly boarded the An Huan chartered steamer, heading towards Wuchang. At 5:00 PM, the steamer arrived at the Hanyangmen pier. The security measures on the steamer and on the riverbank were as strict as in Hankou. Under the surveillance of military and police, Liu ascended the steps, maintaining his composure. After landing, Liu and the detectives and bailiffs rode in the Higher Court's prepared No. 360 car to the court. The remaining military and police escorted them in two other cars. At 5:10 PM, they arrived at the entrance of the Higher Court, entered the auditorium directly, and Chief Prosecutor Bian Shizeng dispatched personnel to complete the handover procedures with the Shanghai Police Bureau. Liu was then handed over to the director's office of the First Prison Detention Center for custody, where he received considerable courtesy. It is said that before Liu was escorted back, the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office had already begun investigating the assassination of Yang Yongqin. The assassin, Cheng Bianchao (aka Tan Wenxin), and accomplices, suspects Gu Yifan, Luo Jingning, Wen Maogong, Gong Bozhou, Cai Decheng, Yang Qixin, Huang Zhenglin, Wang Guangzong, Yang Xiangmin, Yu Jianzhong, Xiao Ruoxu, Li Qunjian, Li Guozhong, He Yunxiao, and over ten others, are all detained in prison. The Prosecutor's Office will begin the trial in the coming days, summoning all parties to confront Liu, in order to handle the case according to the law. Rumors that Cheng Xiechao had already been executed by firing squad have now been clarified as inaccurate. (March 5th)</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council's Internal Structure</h3>
<p>Reduction in the Number of Specialized Committees, to be Renamed as Offices; Cao Rulin to Assume Leadership of the Foreign Affairs Committee</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Mr. Song Zheyuan has completed his task of entertaining foreign guests in Tianjin. He originally intended to return to Beiping on the 5th to handle political affairs, but due to the resurgence of the land purchase dispute by the Japanese military in Fengtai, Wanping Commissioner Wang Lengzhai came to Tianjin to report. Song is currently negotiating with the other party, seeking a peaceful resolution. At the same time, Lieutenant Colonel Wachi, the Second Section Chief of the Japanese military, has returned to his country to consult with the new cabinet and Land Minister Sugiyama regarding North China diplomacy. He is expected to return to Tianjin on the 7th. Song wants to hear the Japanese side's response before making a move, so he is staying for a few more days. However, due to his long absence from Beiping, political affairs are waiting to be handled. On the 4th, he specifically ordered Qin Dechun, Qi Bianyuan, and Jia Deyao to return to Beiping first to handle everything on his behalf. Song himself will leave Tianjin no later than next Wednesday. Recent rumors of structural changes in the Hebei-Chahar Political Council are still prevalent. Judging from the news obtained here, the various specialized committees under the council will inevitably undergo reorganization, with the name of the committee being abolished or changed to a certain office. In terms of personnel, in order to achieve internal unity and external strength, there will also be slight changes. However, these will not hinder the actual operation. Jia Deyao resigned from the position of Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee a few days ago when he came to Tianjin, facing Song. This position has diplomatic obstacles, and it is difficult to select a successor. Previously, Song had sought Cao Rulin's consent to invite him to take the position, but Cao declined due to illness. Although Song is still searching for a candidate, it is unlikely that anyone will be willing to take the position due to the aforementioned reasons. If necessary, Cao will still be invited to take the honorary chairmanship, while Jia Deyao will actually take on the arduous task.</p>
<p>After the formation of the new Japanese cabinet, the general diplomatic policy towards North China has not yet been put into practice. The garrison headquarters is waiting for Section Chief Wachi's return to convene a meeting of military attachés to decide on the way forward. On his way back, Wachi stopped in Northeast China to visit the new Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Dong Xiuying, to exchange views on diplomacy towards China. The military attachés' meeting is expected to be held around March 20th. Japanese Land Minister Sugiyama recently answered questions from members of the House of Representatives, stating that the diplomatic situation in North China is special and still needs to be handled directly by the army. The Japanese consulates stationed in North China are paying close attention to this. The Jinan Consul-General Ono, the Zhangjiakou Consul Nakane, and the Shanhaiguan Consul Fujii came to Tianjin on the 4th to visit the Tianjin Consul-General Horiuchi to discuss the attitude to be adopted in the future and to assist the army in promoting diplomatic strategies. On the morning of the 5th, they also held a meeting at the British Concession Consulate to decide to send the Tianjin Consul Kishi Weiichi to return to his country on March 12th with the joint opinions of the consuls in North China to petition the new Foreign Minister Sato and report on the recent diplomatic trends in North China. He is expected to return to Tianjin in about three weeks, after which the consuls in Tianjin, Jinan, and Qingdao will follow the instructions to decide on everything. Overall, the Japanese diplomatic attitude towards North China, whether on the military or diplomatic side, will not be determined until Wachi and Kishi Weiichi return after their briefings.</p>
<p>Sogo Shinji, the president of Xingzhong Company, came to Tianjin on the 26th of last month to attend the board meeting of Tianjin Electric Power Company. Recently, he has been stationed in Tianjin to coordinate the company's plans for developing the North China economy, planning to stay in Tianjin for two months, focusing on the establishment of Tanggu Transportation Company, the restoration of Longyan Iron Mine, and the export of Lu salt. Li Sihao came to Tianjin last week to meet with Sogo, but only exchanged views with each other, without any concrete discussion. However, the export of Lu salt has been negotiated by Sogo with relevant parties for days, and their opinions are close to agreement. It is expected that exports can be realized next month.

<h3>Random Notes from a European Journey (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in Europe, Lieshan</p>
<p>Spain was originally a country with backward military equipment, but this civil war has seen all kinds of new-style military equipment, such as artillery, tanks, and airplanes. On the one hand, this is because the people helping both sides are generous and do not hesitate to supply them. On the other hand, the helpers also want to take this opportunity to test their own military equipment in the field to see if it is good enough. I remember that after the Francoist generals received many of the latest anti-aircraft guns from Germany, they shot down several Russian and French-made planes. A German acquaintance said to me: "You see, German machines are working after all. Our military equipment is better than that of France and Russia." A few days later, several German and Italian-made planes of the Francoist side were also shot down by Russian-made anti-aircraft guns on the Madrid front. So I joked with this acquaintance and asked him if he admitted that Russian military equipment was also good. He did not deny it.</p>
<p>Although it has been less than twenty years since the end of the last European war, the military equipment manufacturing of European countries has made amazing progress in this short period of time. Especially airplanes and anti-aircraft guns, tanks and anti-tank guns. These new-style military equipment will undoubtedly occupy a major position in future wars. Although countries today possess many of these weapons, they have not yet undergone a field test. What the results will be is just a theoretical answer. It is precisely for this reason that European countries want to use the Spanish Civil War as a good testing ground for them. And in fact, they are doing just that.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a member of the French parliament questioned Aviation Minister Cote about why so many French-made planes crashed in the Spanish Civil War. At the time, Mr. Cote replied that most of the crashed planes were old. As for the new French planes, they were very reliable. Mr. Cote's statement amounted to admitting that French planes had participated in the Spanish Civil War. Similarly, a member of the British House of Lords once questioned the British aviation authorities as to why Britain did not send air force attachés to Madrid. According to this member, the latest weapons of various countries, especially air forces, are being tested on the Madrid front. Britain should pay attention to the development of these new-style military equipment. Later, Britain did send an air force attaché to Spain.</p>
<p>If countries continue to test like this, this civil war will probably last for a considerable period of time. Only the Spanish people will suffer.</p>
<p>Twenty-One. The Spanish Civil War and the Issue of Volunteer Armies</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the most disappointing thing in the Spanish Civil War is the weakness of the Spanish soldiers' combat effectiveness. Because the Spanish lacked the ability to fight and could not use new military equipment, the helpers themselves became anxious, which led to the issue of volunteer armies. In addition to sending a large number of air force personnel, Germany and Italy are said to have recently transported formal troops in plain clothes to Spain to join the Francoist generals' forces. Similarly, socialists from various countries have also run to Spain to help the "People's Front" government. Left-wing newspapers praised these people as warriors fighting for socialism. Right-wing newspapers say they are "cannon fodder." However, one point is recognized by both sides: that the defense of Madrid is due to the efforts of these international volunteer armies.</p>
<p>Speaking of the volunteer armies from various countries participating in the Spanish Civil War, the situation is different. Most of the German and Italian fascists standing on the side of the Francoist generals have received military training and are stronger. Conversely, the volunteer armies on the side of the "People's Front" government, except for some military experts or junior officers from France and Russia, are just ordinary communists and socialists from various countries. This group of people is still a "disorganized mob." Although they have the spirit of sacrificing for their cause, they lack war experience. As a result, they are only good at defensive warfare when fighting, and their combat effectiveness is not as good when it comes to offensive warfare. We can see this very clearly in the fighting on the Madrid front in the past month. So it makes one wonder whether recruiting another batch of such international troops and sending them to Spain can guarantee the "People's Front" government a final victory. It still seems to be a question.</p>
<p>Relying solely on its own strength, or with the international army as the main force, the "People's Front" government probably cannot resolve the Spanish Civil War in a considerable amount of time. If France and Russia are willing to send formal troops into Spain to help fight, then the chaos can be quelled within one or two months. However, such an action will definitely arouse the resentment of Germany and Italy, and may result in a world war. The hope of Britain and France is to turn the Spanish incident into a local event so that it does not affect the whole of Europe. Therefore, the problem of banning volunteer armies from going to Spain has recently arisen in various European countries. Needless to say, this is a blow to the "People's Front" government.</p>
<p>According to a gentleman with military knowledge, besides the French and Russian national armies, only the Chinese Red Army has the ability to help the "People's Front" government resolve the internal chaos. If these tens of thousands of Red Army soldiers went to Spain, they would definitely create a different situation in less than a month. "This may be good for everyone," he said. "In the eyes of the communists, the revolution is world-wide anyway. Whether it is in China or in Spain, it is the same. In our Chinese eyes, this would at least temporarily avoid Chinese fighting Chinese within China...</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Financial Fluctuations in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Rumors of Increased Value of Guangdong Currency Cause Decline in Shanghai Exchange Rate; Shanghai-Guangdong Exchange Rate Gradually Recovers After Increased Issuance of Subsidiary Currency</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province's finances have experienced a major fluctuation in recent days. The Hong Kong and Shanghai exchange rates have suddenly fallen. The ratio of Hong Kong dollars and Guangdong subsidiary currency has dropped from plus 54 to plus 48. The ratio of silver dollars to Guangdong subsidiary currency has dropped from plus 5 to plus 47. The reason for this is that there are widespread rumors that the central authorities are considering increasing the value of the Guangdong currency, causing the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchange rates to fall accordingly. When the Shanghai exchange rate fell on the first day, the ratio of Shanghai banknotes to Guangdong subsidiary currency set by the Provincial Bank was still plus 5, while foreign banks outside were only receiving plus 47 for Shanghai banknotes. Those banks that had Shanghai banknotes in storage transferred them in large quantities to the Provincial Bank to exchange for Guangdong currency. It is said that they made a huge profit from this transfer. At the same time, the Provincial Bank lost a significant amount of exchange water. Therefore, on the day after the sudden surge, the Provincial Bank was forced to change the ratio of Shanghai banknotes to Guangdong currency to be the same as the market ratio, in order to avoid further losses. This contraction of the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchange water lasted for several days. The situation only began to ease on February 28, as the rumors of increasing the value of the Guangdong currency had not been confirmed. At the time, the official person in charge also solemnly stated that the authorities had entrusted the Provincial Bank to maintain the currency value, and the Provincial Bank would continue to follow the Guangdong financial regulation policy already set by the Ministry of Finance. In other words, the ratio of Shanghai banknotes to Guangdong currency would still be set at between plus 48 and plus 5. Moreover, seeing the high value of the Guangdong currency and the low exchange rate of Shanghai currency, they took the opportunity to increase the issuance of 4.5 million yuan of new Guangdong subsidiary currency banknotes in order to balance the exchange rate and maintain the stipulated ratio of plus 5 between Shanghai banknotes and Guangdong currency. Therefore, the Shanghai exchange rate has not fallen further in recent days. As of March 1, the ratio of Guangdong currency to Shanghai banknotes was a little over plus 47. The Hong Kong exchange rate has also risen accordingly, with the Hong Kong exchange rate being between plus 507 yuan per thousand yuan. According to political sources, the ratio of silver dollars to Guangdong currency will remain at the original ratio in the short term. The government does not seem to intend to increase the value of the Guangdong currency. However, the Guangdong Province silver dollar system seems to be accelerating. Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke and Economic Committee Standing Member Song Ziwen will go south in the coming days. There is a report of a major relationship between the Guangdong change to the silver dollar system. In the business community, increasing the value of the Guangdong currency has become a unanimous request in recent years. Because the ratio of silver dollars to Guangdong currency is as high as plus 5, it is extremely difficult to purchase goods from various provinces in the country. Moreover, the domestic products of various provinces are all based on silver dollars, and the cost of transporting goods to Guangdong is too high, making it difficult to sell, and business decline is inevitable. If the Shanghai exchange rate is reduced, it will be easier for goods from various provinces to be transported to Guangdong, and after entering Guangdong, they will also be easier to sell. Therefore, the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce recently sent a call to the central government to reduce the ratio of silver dollars to Guangdong currency again. However, in order to maintain the original plan, the government has not made a sudden change in policy, and has recently increased the issuance of Guangdong subsidiary currency banknotes in order to balance the Shanghai exchange rate. The official and business parties' claims are still in extreme positions.</p>

<h3>⊙The Great Danger of Tuberculosis in Families</h3>
<p>The Shared Meal System and Tuberculosis - As Described by Mr. Yu Yunxiu, a Great Contemporary Chinese Physician</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>The system of shared meals is prevalent throughout China, especially in the South. Around a square table, seven or eight people sit together, with various dishes mixed together and cups and chopsticks intermingling. Family members, father and son, gather in harmony, and guests and hosts alike eat and drink to their fill. It seems intimate and thoughtful, but it is precisely here that the insidious medium of disease transmission lies. Engaging in this practice is no different from knowingly walking on thin ice or plunging into boiling water. Do those who hear this doubt my words? Let me explain using tuberculosis as an example. Although medical science is as advanced as it is today, if the disease progresses, there is little guarantee of a cure. Once diagnosed, the prognosis is uncertain. This is something everyone has heard of and shudders at, avoiding it as quickly as possible. Yet, it spreads wider and wider, and more and more people contract it. We fear it but cannot escape, and avoid it but have nowhere to hide. Is it truly a matter of destiny, hanging in the balance? No, it is due to insufficient knowledge, poor habits, and a failure to prevent it in the right way.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is caused by bacterial infection. It has been over forty years since Dr. Koch of Germany discovered the tuberculosis bacillus. Scholars worldwide have no disagreement. This ancient villain has been exposed, and its discovery is as significant as Yu the Great's forging of the Nine Tripod Cauldrons. Today, even women and children know this, yet only our old customs remain oblivious. These bacteria are less than fifteen ten-thousandths of a millimeter long and less than five ten-thousandths of a millimeter wide. Under a thousand-fold microscope, they look like short whiskers, without feet to walk, without tails to swim, and without wings to fly. The common saying that consumption is caused by anger, or that the "lung worm" is a spiritual being that flies out of a dying person and attaches itself to others, is nonsense. The "Ziting Tuberculosis Capture Method," which describes the shape of the "worm" through six generations, as recorded in Wang Kentang's "Standards of Diagnosis and Treatment," are merely vague and similar descriptions, criticized by the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature) as dealing with the strange.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>When tuberculosis bacteria enter the lungs, they develop, grow, and reproduce ugly offspring. Therefore, the sputum of tuberculosis patients often contains these bacteria. In severe cases, even a tiny speck of sputum contains thousands of these bacteria. This can be clearly counted under a microscope and is not just empty words or threats. Based on this, how many billions of bacteria are in a mouthful of sputum? This sputum, containing billions of bacteria, is expelled from the lungs, passing through the throat, tongue, and lips. Therefore, how many specks of sputum containing tuberculosis bacteria contaminate the patient's throat, tongue, and lips? The number of bacteria clinging to the patient's throat, tongue, and lips is unimaginable. Once cups and chopsticks come into contact with the mouth of a tuberculosis patient, how many specks of sputum containing tuberculosis bacteria contaminate them? The number of bacteria crawling on the cups and chopsticks is unimaginable. When a tuberculosis patient uses chopsticks to eat from the dishes on the table, how many specks of sputum containing tuberculosis bacteria contaminate the dishes? The number of bacteria attaching and floating in the dishes is also unimaginable. When people at the same table carelessly use the same cups and chopsticks and eat the leftovers, they are swallowing tuberculosis bacteria.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Alas, if a person with tuberculosis is a guest at a feast, perhaps they can avoid spreading the disease through one or two shared meals. But if they are family members living and working together, eating together every day, two or three times a day, they are taking tuberculosis bacteria and swallowing them. How can they avoid spreading the disease? Therefore, I say that engaging in this practice is no different from knowingly walking on thin ice or plunging into boiling water. If someone is not infected, it may be due to a special physical condition, but this is mere luck and cannot be relied upon. Although tuberculosis is often transmitted through the air, contaminated food is also a pathway to disaster. The shared meal system is a way of taking tuberculosis bacteria and suppressing healthy people. Is this not a bad habit? Is it not something that wise people should be alarmed by and avoid? Is it not something that benevolent and virtuous people should loudly denounce and eradicate? The prevalence of tuberculosis in China is truly alarming, like a raging flood whose limits are unknown, and it is a source of national decline and racial weakness. Those who care about the world should pay attention to reforming this custom. (This article is reprinted from Yu's Medical Discourses)</p>
<h3>The Latest Medical Treatment for Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., tuberculosis) is the tubercle bacillus. Once this bacterium enters the human body, it forms nodules at that location, cutting off the blood supply. Furthermore, the tubercle bacillus secretes an acid-resistant wax that encapsulates its body to protect against the intrusion of external medicinal forces. Therefore, even with various antibacterial drugs taken internally or injected, they cannot reach the actual body of the bacteria. The natural therapy, symptomatic therapy, physical therapy, serum therapy, pharmaceutical therapy, and all other treatments traditionally used by physicians have not been entirely successful. The saying that there is no cure for tuberculosis has spread throughout the world because this profound scientific principle was unknown. Consequently, modern tuberculosis scholars, based on the aforementioned scientific principle, have continued their research tirelessly. As a result, they have created a chemical holy grail that eradicates tuberculosis bacteria, called Sanosin. This drug was successfully developed in accordance with the latest medical principles of Dr. Koch of Germany, the discoverer of the tuberculosis bacillus, and Dr. Berger of Germany, the inventor of the tuberculosis bacillus dewaxing technique. According to experimental reports from various tuberculosis sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating the nodules of tuberculosis and dissolving the physique, and it also has bactericidal power. It can radically cure tuberculosis in stages one, two, and three and has a proven effective effect in ten thousand tests. In China, the Central Hygiene Laboratory of the National Government has tested the drug's properties and found it to be harmless and non-toxic, with absolutely no side effects. A brief description of its therapeutic effects is provided below.</p>
<p>(1) When the medicinal power of "Sanosin" is tested in a test tube, the acid resistance of the tubercle bacillus disappears after one minute. After three minutes, the tubercle bacillus is completely eradicated, with no survivors.</p>
<p>(2) Animal experiments have found that "Sanosin" can penetrate the tuberculosis lesions. Examination of the tubercle bacilli lurking within the lesions reveals that they have lost their acid resistance, which proves that their waxy substance has been completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) When patients take "Sanosin" internally for about a week, they immediately experience a diluted sputum and a reduced body temperature, indicating a positive state.</p>
<p>(4) Continued internal administration of "Sanosin" for 30 to 60 days or more will visibly increase body weight, stimulate appetite, and gradually alleviate all symptoms, ultimately achieving the great feat of regeneration.</p>
<p>A Sanosin experimental report and a tuberculosis treatment guide will be sent upon request.</p>

<h3>International Cup Soccer: Unexpected Result – Jewish Team Gains Final Qualification</h3>
<p>Eliminating England 4-3</p>
<p>The replay of the International Cup soccer championship between England and the Jewish team was held at the racecourse yesterday. The English team, with Loyal at its core and supported by elite English players such as the French businessman Xibu, had a strong lineup. The Jewish team, on the other hand, consisted mostly of the best players from Lacky and Western businessmen. After yesterday's match, the English team performed poorly, resulting in a 2-2 draw in the first half. In the second half, the Jewish team scored two more goals, while the English team only managed one, resulting in England being eliminated with a total score of 4-2. The Jewish team won the right to play in the International Cup final and will compete against the winner between China and Portugal for the championship at a scheduled date. The result of yesterday's game can be considered unexpected. Before the game, England was highly favored, as Loyal was at the peak of his career and had sufficient strength, making it difficult for the Jewish team to compete. The Chinese team was concerned about the Portuguese team, but also about England. Now that the Jewish team has eliminated England, it indirectly benefits the Chinese team immensely. The only difficulty now is how to solve the Portuguese issue. If we can successfully overcome this hurdle, then winning the championship again should be easier than expected. Yesterday, because the fields in various locations were not completely dry, the replay of the International Cup between the Chinese team and Portugal at the Shen Garden and the morning league match between Jinde and Zhendan at Hongkou Park were both postponed and rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Zhou Ruquan Retains Championship in 10,000-Meter Walk</h3>
<p>Time: 1 hour, 50 minutes, 35.2 seconds; Xie Xingdao still disqualified due to improper form; Tan Rongsheng wins in the exhibition group</p>
<p>The third 20,000-meter walking competition organized by the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau was held in the downtown area yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. As a result, Tan Rongsheng won the championship in the exhibition group with a time of 1 hour, 48 minutes, and 17 seconds. Zhou Ruquan retained the championship in the open group with a time of 1 hour, 50 minutes, and 35.2 seconds. Although Xie Xingdao reached the finish line first, he was still disqualified due to improper form. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Starting Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., referees, Boy Scouts, and athletes arrived at the front gate of Fudan University one after another. Although the weather was cloudy and slightly cold, their spirits were high. This year's competition included four deaf-mute participants and two elderly participants, which added to the interest of the spectators. At 8:50 a.m., the roll call was taken, and 51 people were present. Those who were absent were Zhu Rongxiang, Chen Shulun, Cai Renliang, Shen Zule, Xu Yunsheng, and five others. At exactly 9:00 a.m., at the sound of the gun, 1,502 swift feet surged forward towards Xiangyin Road. It was difficult to see who was in the lead at first. After 500 meters, Xie Xingdao, Zhou Ruquan, Qiu Dechang, and others began to lead the way, with Tan Rongsheng following closely behind, while Wang Yuren and Zheng Chengshan lagged behind by more than 20 meters.</p>
<p>Competition Midway</p>
<p>In this long-distance of 20,000 meters, there was a sense of "the road is long and difficult to reach the end." However, Xie Xingdao and Zhou Ruquan remained close throughout, sometimes in front, sometimes behind, neither too close nor too far. Qiu Dechang had led the way for the first 1,000 meters, but after reaching Kongjiang Road, he declined sharply. At Ma Yushan Road, Zhou was ahead of Xie, at the Military Industry Road Power Plant, Xie was ahead of Zhou, and at the Water and Electricity Plant, Zhou was again ahead of Xie. In the end, Xie was still ahead of Zhou, but the distance between them was no more than 100 meters. Tan Rongsheng had maintained third place since Kongjiang Road, and at the Water and Electricity Plant, he suddenly sprinted and overtook Zhou and Xie to take the lead. Zheng Chengshan suffered a cramp and fell behind, while Wang Jingren remained between fifth and sixth place throughout. The others fluctuated greatly, and Lin Jiemu, who was watched by the crowd, unfortunately dropped out due to a lack of stamina.</p>
<p>Reaching the Finish Line</p>
<p>At about 10:45 a.m., Tan Rongsheng reported his arrival, and applause erupted. About 100 meters behind him was Xie Xingdao, and another 10 meters behind was Zhou Ruquan. When Xu Aichen and Wang Jingren arrived, they were already 500 meters away from Zhou, while Xu Guofu and Le Acai were nearly 1,000 meters behind. The subsequent order was Yang Jun, Cui Weimin, Wu Runchang, Tang Wenyi, Shen Jingsheng, Qiu Dechang, Shi Binggui, Zhu Shiying, Chen Chungeng, and others. All participants arrived by 11:45 a.m., and the count was 44 people. The elderly Wu Shuifu was 36th, Ge Jingkang was 41st, the deaf-mute Qian Jiazhang was 29th, and Li Wenbin was 42nd.</p>
<p>Recorded Rankings</p>
<p>After inspection and deliberation by the referees, and after excluding those who committed fouls, the official rankings were announced as follows: Exhibition Group: 1st place, Tan Rongsheng, time 1 hour, 48 minutes, 17 seconds; 2nd place, Wang Jingren, time 1 hour, 55 minutes, 17.4 seconds. Open Group: 1st place, Zhou Ruquan, time 1 hour, 50 minutes, 35.2 seconds; 2nd place, Xu Aichen, time 1 hour, 55 minutes, 17 seconds; 3rd place, Xu Guofu, time 1 hour, 57 minutes, 28.4 seconds; 4th place, Yang Jun, 5th place, Tang Wenyi, 6th place, Shen Jingsheng, 7th place, Qiu Dechang, 8th place, Shi Binggui, 9th place, Zhu Shiying, 10th place, Chen Chungeng.</p>
<p>Disqualifications</p>
<p>Many people were disqualified for committing fouls yesterday, but the most regrettable was Xie Xingdao. Xie reached the finish line with a time of 1 hour, 50 minutes, and 22.4 seconds, but he was not recorded due to improper form. It was found that Xie had won first place in the previous competition but was disqualified. At that time, because all the referees were hired by the Chinese Walking Association, it was still feared that people would suspect collusion. Therefore, this year, referees were hired from all parties, including those from Beijing, who did not know any of the athletes. Therefore, Xie's improper form has become an ironclad rule. According to the referees, Xie's form needs to be fundamentally trained and corrected before he can participate again. It is hoped that Xie will see winning or losing as a small matter. If he can correct his form and practice diligently, he can still be a talented person. However, if he is discouraged by this and harbors resentment, then there is no hope for his future. Furthermore, his outrageous shouting after the referee announced his disqualification was not appropriate behavior. In addition, the Chinese Municipal Bureau's car was driving back and forth in front of and behind Xie, which is not allowed by the rules and may have contributed to Xie's foul. It is hoped that attention will be paid to this.</p>
<p>Awards Ceremony</p>
<p>After the competition, the awards were presented at the City Hall steps at 12:00 noon. Section Chief Zhang of the Social Affairs Bureau, Yu Zhongbiao of the City Party Department, Honorary Secretary-General Ma Chonggan, Chief Referee Shao Rugan, Secretary-General Wang Keyong, and others were present. Yuan Zengyu presided over the ceremony, following the proper etiquette. First, Section Chief Zhang gave a speech, stating that this year's course was twice as long as the previous year's, so there were fewer participants, but their spirits were very good. He hoped that they would practice diligently and that the goal for the next competition would be to increase the distance to 50,000 meters. Next, Yu Zhongbiao of the City Party Department gave a speech, and Chief Referee Shao Rugan reported. Finally, the awards were presented. The first-place winner received Mayor Wu's shield, Director Pan's cup, and Mayor Wu's flag. The second-place winner received Mayor Wu's shield and flag, and Director Pan's shield. The third-place winner received the same. The fourth-place winner received Mayor Wu's flag and Director Pan's shield. The fifth-place winner received the same. The sixth to tenth-place winners each received Director Pan's shield. In addition, all those who completed the entire course received a medal. It is reported that all the prizes were manufactured by the Biao Di Sports Equipment Company, and the designs were quite beautiful.</p>

<h3>Xiqing Men's Volleyball Team to Battle Haiqing, Suzhou Shell</h3>
<p>Two Class A Matches; Women's Games Yesterday</p>
<p>There will be two Class A matches today for Xiqing volleyball. Both are second-round matches. Haiqing will play against Su Keer. In the previous match, Haiqing almost suffered an upset, but the strength of the two teams is vastly different. Therefore, if Haiqing does not underestimate its opponent tonight, it should win steadily. In the other match, the Russian team will meet Xiqing again. The Russian team has the momentum of defeating Haiqing, and its strength has returned to normal. Xiqing is suffering from a new defeat. Therefore, although the Russian team once surrendered to Xiqing, the outcome of tonight's match is difficult to predict. In the women's matches the night before last, the Public Concession Girls' High School won again. The Red team only scored one point in the first set, a maximum of four points in the second set, and only two points in the last set, for a total score of 45 to 7. The difference was as much as 38 points, and the difference in strength was like heaven and earth. The schedule and women's results for tonight are as follows:</p>
<p>Tonight's Schedule</p>
<p>Russian Team vs. Xiqing (Class A) 7:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Haiqing vs. Su Keer (Class A) 7:30 p.m.</p>

<h3>Fujian Province Implements Mass Literacy Education Plan</h3>
<p>Already Filed with the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>The first-year (25th year of the Republic) plan for mass literacy education in Fujian Province for out-of-school citizens has been filed with the Ministry of Education by the provincial government. The original plan is quite lengthy. Its main points are that mass schools will be established in counties and cities, with each Lianbao (collective security unit) as a unit. The distribution of school locations should be as even as possible. In addition to providing education to the general out-of-school population and providing education to workers in factories or companies, starting with the implementation of this plan, each prison in the provincial capital and various counties and cities will have a mass school established by its governing office to teach out-of-school citizens in prison. The methods, in addition to being handled in accordance with ordinary mass schools, should also pay attention to correcting their thoughts and imparting skills for making a living. The overview of the establishment of mass schools in various counties and cities throughout Fujian Province in the 15th year is as follows: The total population of all 64 counties and cities in the province is 10,058,631. Excluding those who are already in school, the number of out-of-school citizens who should receive literacy education is 4,537,960. According to this year's mass education plan, the number of out-of-school citizens who should be enrolled this year should be 276,456. Therefore, 1,441 to 2,830 mass schools will be established this year, with 5,547 classes, to accommodate out-of-school citizens. They are roughly divided into three categories: ⑴ Large counties and cities with more than 100,000 people who should receive literacy education: the number of people who should be enrolled this year is stipulated to account for one-twenty-first of the total number of people who should be educated. ⑵ Medium-sized counties and cities with more than 50,000 people who should receive literacy education: the number of people who should be enrolled this year is stipulated to account for one-sixteenth of the total number of people who should be educated. ⑶ Small counties and cities with less than 50,000 people who should receive literacy education: the number of people who should be enrolled this year is stipulated to account for one-twenty-seventh of the total number of people who should be educated. As for the teachers of mass schools, the education departments have established mass education teacher training institutes in various districts to train students sent by the counties for the purpose of implementing mass literacy education.</p>

It is divided into two volumes, the first volume contains fifteen articles with detailed guidance for students of all types, including male and female students, overseas Chinese students, arts, sciences, commerce, law, education, agriculture, engineering and medical students, as well as normal school students, boy scouts, and students studying abroad. The second volume contains twenty articles explaining research methods in various subjects such as politics, economics, education, literature and art, books, music, etc. Issues such as hygiene, further education, and employment are also discussed in detail. It is a truly essential book for students nationwide to pursue their studies and cultivate themselves. The educational community unanimously praised Mr. Cai Yuanpei who lauded the book saying, "The 'Student's Guide' broadly covers various methods of studying, and discusses the pros and cons of choosing a career after graduation, emphasizing reading, exercise, and hygiene. It enables readers to choose a plan, proceed in an orderly manner, and have a standard for both exertion and relaxation. It prevents them from being lured by schools that deceive and seek profit, and from being exploited by ruthless and unscrupulous ambitious individuals. It can truly be said to educate students with virtue and perfect their qualities." The book is a large volume of over 300,000 words, priced at two yuan, with a reduced price of one yuan and ten cents, and now further reduced by 30% to eighty-four cents. Postage by registered mail is an additional twelve cents. Buyers have been flocking to purchase it, and over a thousand copies have already been sold. The distributor is the Qin Fen Medical Bureau at 277 Sima Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Issues Regarding the Middle School Graduation Examination</h3>
<p>---Answering</p>
<p>⑶</p>
<p>Does this mean that the joint examination has no serious flaws? Not so. The situation in the previous Beijing primary schools, where the joint examination increased the workload, may still be the case in middle schools across the country. Even if the subjects for the joint examination have been reduced, schools still inevitably increase the teaching hours for the subjects tested in the joint examination. For example, subjects like Chinese history and Chinese geography, their academic schedules have already been completed in the second grade. Subjects like foreign history, foreign geography, mathematics, and chemistry, although they are completed only in the last semester, a large part or part of the academic schedule has also long passed. It is not easy to prepare for the examination of these past subjects and academic schedules without a review. Moreover, schools with poor grades feel that they have been negligent in the past, and there is no way to take the examination without reviewing. Even those with good grades feel that they must review in order to win the competition. As a result, the learning burden on young people has increased sharply, and the damage to their health can be known without measuring their weight. Or how to correct the problem? The subjects and academic schedules of the joint examination can be limited to those in the last semester, without having to trace back to the past. This is a sincere consideration for the joint examination. What about those who still have to take the entrance examination after graduation, which requires testing of the entire academic schedule? Moreover, the graduation examination is limited to the graduation level, while the entrance examination even exceeds the graduation level. This issue is still above the joint examination issue. If the entrance examination and the graduation joint examination cannot be communicated and combined, then those who can be exempted from the joint examination cannot be exempted from the entrance examination. Why blame this temporary exemption and then concentrate the difficulties later? If they can be combined into one, then the examination will inevitably cover the entire academic schedule, and there is no reason to only test the scope of the last stage. It seems that there is no need to change the subjects and academic schedule content of the joint examination for the time being. For the current plan, instead of allowing schools to increase the number of hours and review past academic schedules on their own, it is better to order schools to stipulate 3 to 5 hours of review time per week outside of class in the last semester, and to allocate it to the joint examination subjects in moderation. The teachers of each subject should provide practical guidance, and no additional teaching hours should be added inside or outside of class. In this way, both practical needs and the learning burden can be taken into consideration. In addition, there is one more thing, that is, the publication of the passing grades of the joint examination. In the past, it seemed that the award-winning approach was adopted. The scores of each subject for each student were posted according to the scores. Now that the joint examination system has been established and there is no fear of obstacles, it seems that there is no need to disclose the score. Only announce the results separately according to whether they passed or failed. This is also to reduce its stimulation and maintain the mental health of young people. The author does not absolutely support the joint examination system. However, before the principle of using examinations as a method of examining academic performance can be fundamentally reformed, it is considered that the joint examination is not more harmful than the strict examination held by the school, but is more beneficial. However, the atmosphere of temporary tension caused by the joint examination and the improper measures of the school have a serious impact. At the same time, the entrance examination, which is closely related to the time of the joint examination, is theoretically impossible to repeat, and in fact, the difficulty of the latter exceeds the former several times. As a result, the observers are unclear, the arguments are confused, the joint examination is criticized, and it is cursed as an oppressive policy. In all fairness, how can the joint examination system bear its expenses? For the sake of protecting young people and their academic studies, we dare to ask those who actually handle it to earnestly reflect on the practical basis of teaching each subject at ordinary times, carefully examine academic performance, and cultivate students' habit of studying hard and taking examinations. At the same time, we ask the educational administrative organs to supervise and correct the indiscriminate increase of teaching hours by various schools concentrated on the subjects of the joint examination and the suspension of teaching subjects not included in the joint examination. Finally, we ask the educational administrative authorities and various universities to find a way to communicate the university entrance examination with the high school graduation joint examination, and strive to rationalize the examination. In this way, the inherent and external difficulties of the joint examination system can be reduced to a minimum, and the practical effect of streamlining academic standards and improving teaching efficiency can be greatly enhanced. This is my humble wish to discuss with colleagues in the church community. (The End)</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Xiong Xiling and Others Return to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Issue Written Statement Stating that the Conference Proposals Were All Beneficial to Our Country, Passport Requirements for Chinese Traveling to Singapore and Gender Ratio Restrictions Have Been Revoked, Promoting the World Red Swastika Society as Xiong's Second Mission Abroad</p>
<p>According to the Shenzhou News Agency, Xiong Xiling and other four representatives of our country who attended the second Far East Conference for the Suppression of Traffic in Women and Children, convened by the League of Nations, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the Java Company's ship "Chisadani." The ship docked at the Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf at 10:30 AM. The Shenzhou News Agency reporter has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Welcome to Xiong and Others Upon Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>In addition to Consul Song Faxiang, who returned to his post after attending, the other representatives of our country, including World Red Swastika Society President Xiong Xiling and his wife, Executive Committee Member of the Children's Welfare Association Chen Heqin, and Director of the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute Ms. Guan Ruiwu, a total of four representatives, returned to China yesterday morning aboard the "Chisadani." Representatives from various circles who went to the ship to welcome them included Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the National Government Accounting Committee; Zhu Tingqi and his wife, Director of the Ministry of Finance Salt Revenue Inspection Office; Chen Tiesheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Children's Welfare Association; Zhang Guanshan, Vice President of the World Red Swastika Society China Southeast Branch; and Team Leader Hu Zhongcheng of the Red Swastika Society, leading ten members, as well as other charity figures such as Han Fuhang and his wife, Li Cikai and his wife, Wang Daoyuan, Tian Xiuben, and more than 50 others. The ship arrived at the new customs wharf at 12:00 PM. Xiong and others took a group photo with the welcomers at the wharf before departing separately.</p>
<p>Xiong's Second Mission Abroad</p>
<p>In addition to attending the conference, Xiong's second mission abroad was to take advantage of the gathering of various charitable organizations in the Far East to promote the situation of the international charitable organization "World Red Swastika Society," which was founded in China. According to Xiong's statement to the Shenzhou News Agency reporter yesterday, the World Red Swastika Society was founded in China, but there are still places abroad that are unaware of it, and some even think that the Swastika is related to the German National Socialist Party. This time, after explaining it to people from various countries, he has won the understanding and sympathy of the representatives. He hosted a banquet for all the representatives in Wannjiang, which was particularly pleasant. His impression of this trip abroad is excellent. The World Red Swastika Society and this Conference for the Suppression of Traffic in Women and Children are indeed of great importance: ⑴ The Association's various disaster relief efforts for water, drought, and war, in order to prevent women and children from being victimized by disasters, are a passive means of preventing trafficking in women and children. ⑵ Using moral influence to prevent frequent family separations. ⑶ The Association runs women's vocational training centers, orphanages, etc., which are active ways to prevent trafficking in women and children. The Red Swastika Society was founded in the 12th year of the Republic of China and has been actively engaged in charitable work ever since. According to Ms. Wu Yanwen, Xiong's wife, the abolition of officially sanctioned brothels has been passed, and countries will take actions in various fields to complete it in the future. As for women serving society, China is already working on it. According to Mr. Chen Heqin, the Chinese representatives at this conference argued on principle, and the requirements for Chinese to have food passports when going to Singapore and the gender ratio of Chinese entering the country have been abolished. The conference also resolved that: ⑴ The League of Nations should seek the consent of the Chinese government and cooperate with the authorities in the concessions in China to engage in anti-trafficking work. ⑵ Cooperate with shipping companies to prevent trafficking. ⑶ To rescue prostitutes, it advocates starting with education and medical methods. All of these were proposed by our representatives and passed by the conference.</p>
<p>The Delegation Issues a Written Statement</p>
<p>Xiong and the other four representatives issued a written statement aboard the ship yesterday, stating, "The League of Nations has always paid great attention to the issue of trafficking in women and children. The first conference was held in Geneva in 1921, and the problem of trafficking in women and children in Europe and America was largely resolved. In recent years, the League of Nations has been committed to the problem of trafficking in women and children in the Far East. In 1930, it sent personnel to investigate. The group consisted of one American and one Swede. They traveled from Europe to Asia, passing through Singapore, Siam, Annam, the Philippines, China, Japan, the Dutch East Indies, India, Persia, Syria, and other countries for a year and a half. The investigation was completed in 1932, and a report was published, which attracted great attention from various countries. The report proposed a variety of methods, and it seemed necessary for governments to take common steps. As a result, the League of Nations held this Far East Conference for the Suppression of Traffic in Women and Children. A total of 30 representatives from nine countries participated in this conference, including the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States, the Hong Kong government, China, France, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Siam, and the United States. There were also six international organizations and seven private organizations, with a total of 30 representatives. The Chinese private organizations were invited to participate by the government, including the World Red Swastika Society China General Association, the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, and the Peiping Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute. This conference began on February 2 and lasted until the 13th, a total of one week. The agenda was predetermined. Each time a problem was discussed, the representatives of each country would first submit a report at the conference, and then the representatives would debate and suggest. After the discussion had some direction, it would be submitted to the small group meeting for detailed review, and then submitted to the conference for voting. Therefore, the establishment and passage of a resolution required thorough research and considerable debate. The results of the meeting were satisfactory.</p>
<p>Six Resolutions Benefit China</p>
<p>Various resolutions are very beneficial to China, such as the first resolution to promote close cooperation and exchange of information between the police departments and competent authorities of various countries and the anti-trafficking agencies. The conference has resolved to establish an information office to handle this matter. When the League of Nations Far East Trafficking in Women and Children Investigation Team came to China for inspection several years ago, it felt that it was necessary for the countries of the East to cooperate effectively on this issue, and the information office was necessary to exchange information between countries. The Chinese representatives believe that in addition to setting up an information office, liaison officers should be added to enhance the effectiveness of cooperation. This proposal was also adopted by the conference. In the past, the most difficult point for China in preventing and suppressing trafficking in women and children was the concessions in the coastal trading ports, because the Chinese concessions were places where Chinese government orders could not reach, and they were no different from places to hide dirt. Now, they can contact each other and communicate with each other, so that the villains who traffic in people are no longer easy to be active in the concessions. Therefore, this resolution is of great benefit to China. However, the Chinese representatives hope that this information office can be established in Shanghai. The largest gain of the second proposal, which is to prevent trafficking in women and children, is that the shipping companies in various ports should cooperate with the local government to prevent the trafficking of women and children. Regarding the third proposal, we express satisfaction with the cooperation between the Far East police departments and other agencies and private organizations and government agencies, and hope that they will continue to work together to enhance the welfare of women and children. Regarding the fourth proposal, the authorities in charge of the welfare of women and children should widely employ female staff. This issue has been practiced in China for many years. The conference's resolution also hopes that local governments should make every effort to employ more female staff in the future. Regarding the fifth proposal, which is the abolition of officially sanctioned brothels, this issue is due to the existence of officially sanctioned prostitution systems in Eastern countries, such as Japan and French territories. Therefore, its resolution can only be made in principle: ⑴ Expand publicity work and cultivate public opinion, and use educational methods to eliminate prostitution. ⑵ Impose appropriate restrictions administratively, and provide prostitutes with medical diagnosis, treatment, and relief. Regarding the sixth proposal, the Far East White Russian issue, the conference decided that the League of Nations should select a commissioner to handle the matter in the Far East. The Chinese representatives gave the foreign representatives a very deep impression this time. The representatives of all countries also paid great attention to this conference and made long-term preparations."</p>
<h3>This City's Women's Association to Commemorate "March 8th" Today</h3>
<p>Meeting and Broadcasting for Widespread Promotion, the Association Also Issues a Letter to Women</p>
<p>Today is International Women's Day. To raise awareness among women throughout the city and express its views, the Shanghai Women's Association is holding a commemorative meeting at the Huadong Women's Middle School on Xiafei Road. This morning, they will invite celebrities to broadcast on Yasheng and Greater China radio stations. This afternoon, the association will send members to remote and educationally underdeveloped areas in the suburbs for widespread promotion. The association will also issue a "Letter to Women on International Women's Day." The original text is as follows: "Dear sisters, today is March 8th, a day to commemorate the liberation of women worldwide. On March 8th, 1909, a group of awakened women in the United States, unwilling to accept social discrimination and unequal treatment, rose up and held a great demonstration to awaken women to seek their own liberation. Therefore, at the International Women's Socialist Congress held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided that March 8th would be International Women's Day. In 1911, women in Germany and the United States took the lead in commemorating the day by holding a great mass demonstration on March 8th. At the same time, more than 80,000 female workers in Vienna, Austria, participated, demanding 'women's suffrage and protection of female workers,' and striving for equality between men and women in politics, economics, and society. Later, women in Britain, the Netherlands, and other countries held similar events. Thus, March 8th became a day for international women to promote solidarity and seek equal liberation. The various constraints and oppressions suffered by Chinese women are far more severe than those faced by women in Europe and America, and their demands for freedom and equality are even more pressing. Since the high tide of the 'March 8th' commemoration spread to East Asia, Chinese women have also automatically commemorated it in the same way as women around the world. This not only shows the awareness of Chinese women regarding their own suffering but also deeply reflects their understanding and courage regarding the need for revolution. Therefore, since the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, awakened Chinese women have enthusiastically participated, and the government has been able to respond to the demands of women by enacting many laws to improve the status of women. Today, although most Chinese women are still in bondage and oppression, it cannot be denied that there have been considerable gains in terms of politics and law. Therefore, we believe that the Chinese women's movement should do more active work in the future, to be clearer, that is, to act in accordance with the purpose of this association, to awaken women's national sense of responsibility, promote their morality and intelligence, participate in the National Revolution, and enhance their own and the nation's welfare. Its important tasks are: (1) planning for the improvement of women's lives and habits; (2) developing women's education; (3) developing women's careers; (4) conducting various investigations into the women's movement; (5) promoting the women's movement; (6) improving their families and their organization; (7) ensuring the motherhood of national survival; (8) protecting women's human rights; (9) providing relief to women; and (10) developing social welfare. In addition, China is now in a time of great national crisis, and our women should strive to rise up and, under the guidance of the government, do the work of resisting aggression and saving the country. When China is free and equal, most of China's women's problems can be solved as well. May all my female compatriots work hard."</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Revision of</h3>
<p>Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Income Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on the resolution of the Special Committee on Income Tax, yesterday submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting revisions to the detailed rules for the implementation of income tax. The original petition stated: "Regarding the matter of submitting petitions, it was resolved at the meeting convened by the association on January 20th to study income tax, that two points of opinion be submitted for revision regarding Article 7, paragraph 1, and Article 26 of the detailed rules for implementation. On February 5th, the association forwarded the situation to the Ministry of Finance, which issued approval No. 12288. After the adjournment of the study meeting, the association considered that the implementation of income tax is closely related to commerce and is extremely complex. To ensure thorough discussion, a special committee was organized to continue the study. In addition to the opinions on the collection guidelines, which have been submitted directly to the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance for adoption, the results of the study on the detailed rules for implementation propose fourteen revisions or additions. The articles are listed separately on another sheet of paper. We respectfully request that the Executive Yuan (Ministry) review them. Some require a brief explanation, such as the proposed revision of Article 7, which is the same as the proposal submitted by the association on February 5th, No. 87, on behalf of the representatives of various chambers of commerce. However, the wording of this revision is slightly different from the previous one in terms of detail. The proposal to delete Article 14 in its entirety is because the association's document No. 88, submitted to the Executive Yuan (Ministry) on February 4th, requesting the revision of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, has already explained that the current mandatory savings of various industries are the same as statutory savings in terms of function and meaning. Since the scope of the regulations is requested to be expanded, the restrictions added in Article 14 of the detailed rules for implementation should be deleted to ensure consistency. The proposed revision of Article 36 regarding the time limit for tax refunds is because tax payment has a fixed period, so tax refunds should be handled in the same way to avoid merchants waiting for years and suffering losses. Other articles that are proposed to be revised are considered unnecessary to explain further and are not mentioned again in the document. This petition is prepared and submitted, respectfully requesting that the Executive Yuan (Ministry) grant approval to adopt each item and allow the revisions, as it is for the public benefit. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, attached are the proposed revisions to the articles of the detailed rules for the implementation of income tax: Article 7: This article is proposed to be revised as follows: 'The term 'capital' refers to the paid-in capital of a company organized as a corporation, or the actual capital invested in other organizations. If there is a public reserve fund, it may be included in the calculation of capital.' Article 12: This article is proposed to be revised as follows: 'Non-profit legal persons or organizations that also engage in profit-making activities shall pay taxes on the profit-making portion in accordance with the regulations.' Article 14: This article is proposed to be deleted. Article 15: This article is proposed to be revised as follows: 'When calculating income of the first category, the total revenue shall be reduced by the expenses incurred during the business period, bad debts, depreciation, depletion, amortization, inventory consumption, public levies, and public reserve funds stipulated by law, and the remaining amount shall be the net profit, which shall be taxed at the tax rate stipulated in Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations.' Article 17: Please delete the word 'directly' in the fourth paragraph of this article, and delete the phrase 'the travel expenses in the third paragraph of the first item of this article are limited to those who receive remuneration, but shall not exceed 30% of their respective remuneration' at the end of the article. Article 15: Please add a proviso to this article: 'However, in the case of frequently used transactions, the settlement may be made according to the semi-annual settlement period.' Article 22: Please change 'twenty days' in this article to 'one month.' Article 23: Please change 'twenty days' in this article to 'one month.' Article 24: Please change the phrase 'account books and documents' in this article to 'documents.' Article 26: Please change the second paragraph of this article to: 'In addition to public servants who pay income tax in the second category on a monthly basis, freelancers and others engaged in various industries may pay it within one month after the annual settlement.' Also, in the third paragraph of the same article, please change 'settlement interest' to 'payment of interest,' and change the last sentence 'pay within twenty days' to 'pay within one month.' Article 34: Please change 'proof documents' in this article to 'proof documents.' Article 36: This article is proposed to be revised as follows: 'Taxpayers who believe that the income tax withheld should be reduced may apply for a tax refund to the local competent collection agency. When the local competent collection agency receives the aforementioned application for a tax refund, it shall refund it within one month.' Article 45 and Article 46: These two articles are proposed to be revised as Article 45: 'Companies, firms, stores, factories, and profit-making individuals shall, at the time of opening a business, report the name of the person in charge, business address, business type, business year, and actual amount of capital to the local competent collection agency. In addition to complying with the preceding paragraph, limited liability companies shall also report the total amount of share capital, the full amount of each share, and the amount of each public reserve to the local competent collection agency.' Article 46: 'Companies, firms, stores, factories, and profit-making individuals that have already opened a business before the implementation of these detailed rules shall, within six months from the date of implementation of these detailed rules, report the matters listed in the preceding article to the local competent collection agency.'"</p>
<h3>County Party Headquarters Sends Telegram in Response to Unified National Salvation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Headquarters yesterday telegraphed the city party headquarters of this city in response to the "Unified National Salvation" movement. The text reads, "The policy of internal pacification and external resistance has been a consistent national policy of the Central Government. However, internal pacification must be based on unification. Only with domestic unification can we talk about resisting aggression and teaching about national humiliation. The establishment of the Grand Alliance for Unified National Salvation by various circles in your city is a work that is urgently needed at present. The people of the whole country should unite and jointly impose severe sanctions on traitors and remnant communist bandits and warlords who undermine unification in order to complete the great cause of national unification. In addition to expressing unlimited sympathy for this unified national salvation movement, this association respectfully leads the county party members and the masses to follow your city and work together. Respectfully, the Shanghai County Executive Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Party of the Chinese Kuomintang."</p>

<h3>Tram Services on All Routes in the Public Concession Resumed as Usual Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Party and Government Officials Sent to Monitor Order, Which Was Good. Machine Workers to Enter the Factory for Work Today.</p>
<p>Terms of Treatment to be Mediated in Accordance with the Law.</p>
<p>According to Dagong News, after the strike by all the workers in the machinery department of the British-owned Shanghai Tramway Company in the Public Concession, mediation by the party and government agencies was ineffective. The workers in the machinery department went out the day before yesterday morning to block ticket sellers and drivers from going to work, resulting in the inability of all trams to run and the disruption of transportation. After receiving the report, the party and government agencies immediately issued a joint announcement, ordering the resumption of work immediately and awaiting legal mediation on the issue of conditions. In order to comply with the orders of the party and government, all workers entered the factory for work at 6:00 AM yesterday, and tram services on all routes have resumed. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Tram Services on All Routes Resume</p>
<p>The day before yesterday morning, all the drivers and ticket sellers of the British Tramway Company were blocked from working. After receiving the report, the party and government agencies of this city, considering that tram services are related to public transportation, decided after consultation to issue a joint announcement by the Social Bureau of the City Party Headquarters, ordering all workers to resume work immediately. They also summoned representatives of the workers all night for earnest persuasion. In order to comply with the orders of the party and government agencies, all the workers in the transportation department entered the factory at 6:00 AM yesterday and resumed work as usual. Tram services on all routes have also started on time and resumed. Trams on routes 5, 17, and 18 in the French Concession also entered the Public Concession as usual, and all transportation has resumed.</p>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Sent to Monitor</p>
<p>The party and government agencies of this city were deeply concerned that some workers who were unaware of the situation might come out again to block the trams and cause disturbances when the tram workers went to work. Therefore, at about 5:00 AM yesterday morning, Yu Yaoqiu and Lu Yinchu of the City Party Headquarters, Zhu Jintao of the Social Bureau, and Gong Yuting of the General Labor Union took cars to the Yangshupu Station in East Shanghai and the Jing'an Temple Station in West Shanghai for strict monitoring. The Yulin Road Police Station and the Jing'an Temple Police Station in the Public Concession also dispatched a large number of detectives and guard cars to provide strict protection around the factory gates. By 6:30 AM, all the workers were working as usual, and the order was very good. Representatives of the party and government agencies and Chinese and foreign detectives from the police stations also withdrew separately.</p>
<p>Machine Workers Resume Work This Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday happened to be Sunday, and the workers in the machinery department had a holiday as usual. Except for more than 80 night shift workers in the Huishan Road Branch of the machinery department who entered the factory for work at 6:00 PM last night, more than 300 workers in the machinery department of the old Hed Road factory and the new Beikaier Road factory were all day shift workers, so they are scheduled to enter the factory at 6:00 AM this morning and resume work as usual. Party and government agencies will also send personnel to monitor at that time to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Terms of Treatment to be Mediated</p>
<p>Regarding the conditions of treatment requested by the workers: (1) The two dismissed workers should be allowed to resume work. (2) Those who voluntarily resign due to illness or have served for 15 years should also be given a retirement payment of one month for each year of service (and so on). (3) Workers should not have their wages deducted for sick leave. The City Party Headquarters has notified Ivan, the manager of the company, who has accepted it and promised to convene a board meeting to discuss it. In order to quickly resolve the issue, the party and government agencies of this city will still send the original handlers, Lu Yinchu and Yu Yaoqiu of the City Party Headquarters, Zhu Jintao of the Social Bureau, and Zhu Xuefan and Gong Yuting of the General Labor Union, to the company today to conduct mediation. The issue of the Shen Gong workers' request for equal treatment as ticket sellers will also be included in the mediation.</p>
<h3>Three Banks, Including Zhongshi, Increase Government Shares</h3>
<p>Shareholders' Meetings to be Held Separately on a Scheduled Basis</p>
<p>The matter of increasing government shares in three banks, including China Industrial, China General Chamber of Commerce, and Siming Commercial Bank, has been approved by the shareholders' meeting to authorize the board of directors to contact the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry's order specifying the number of government shares was received last month. The three banks are scheduled to convene separate shareholders' meetings on the 22nd of this month to report on the progress of the negotiations and discuss restructuring matters. It is reported that Siming was established in the 34th year of Guangxu during the Qing Dynasty, with a total capital of 1.5 million taels, half of which was collected first. After the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, it was converted into 2.25 million yuan in national currency. This restructuring will expand the capital to 4 million yuan. The old shares will be converted into 337,500 yuan of new shares at a rate of 15%, and the Ministry of Finance will add 3,662,500 yuan of government shares. China General Chamber of Commerce was established in the 22nd year of Guangxu, with a capital of 5 million taels, which was later converted into 7 million yuan of new shares. This restructuring will change the capital to 4 million yuan.

A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency made a special visit. According to Wang, he has been away from the country for 12 years. This time he came back and felt that the country has not only made great progress in material aspects, but also the people's spirit is very different from the past, which he is very gratified about. He has served in the diplomatic field for more than 20 years and has made two trips around the world. The overseas Chinese in various places are extremely concerned about their motherland. Whenever there are natural disasters and man-made disasters in the country, the overseas Chinese can generously donate and are happy to donate. In addition to China, Malaysia, and the overseas Chinese in Central America, there are more than a thousand people, most of whom are engaged in business, with tea and silk cases accounting for the majority. The authorities in Central America treat overseas Chinese very well, and the overseas Chinese and local people have a very harmonious relationship.

<h3>Central Trust Bureau Negotiates with Consulate in Singapore to Handle Domestic Products</h3>
<p>Local Manufacturers Participate in Singapore's National Goods Exhibition Hall</p>
<p>According to Shenzhou News Agency, since the arrival of Gao Lingbai, our country's Consul General in Singapore, he has actively sought to communicate and develop business between Southeast Asia and China. He has also realized that the number of Southeast Asian overseas Chinese who have been working with domestic raw materials and commodities has been increasing in recent years. However, most overseas Chinese businessmen are isolated from domestic market conditions. Even though they are enthusiastic about running domestic products, they often suffer from the lack of trust. Now, in order to alleviate this difficulty and develop overseas trade markets, Gao has sent a special commissioner to Shanghai to negotiate with the Central Trust Bureau. A result has been negotiated. In the future, if overseas Chinese businessmen want to order domestic products, they can first fill out a price inquiry form to the Consulate General in Singapore, and the Consulate will immediately inform the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau to investigate prices on its behalf. If a public tender is required, it will be advertised in the newspaper on its behalf. After receiving a notice from the Bureau regarding the handling situation, our overseas Chinese businessmen can sign a consignment contract with the Consulate General. All customs declaration, tax payment, transportation, and purchase procedures will be handled by the Central Trust Bureau. However, the goods handled must be at least 10,000 yuan or more. According to the capital strength of the Central Trust Bureau, it is set up by the government and is not comparable to general for-profit organizations. The development of international trade and the convenience of overseas Chinese will be enhanced by this.</p>
<p>In addition, domestic lenders in this city are also sparing no effort to develop trade in Southeast Asia. The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, the China National Products Production and Sales Association, and the Singapore Branch of the Bank of China in this city have jointly established the China National Products Exhibition Hall in Singapore. The new layout has been basically completed, and the opening cost is set at 6,000 yuan in national currency, with 20 factories participating in principle. It would be even better if the number could be increased, and a method has been formulated. It is reported that the manufacturers in this city who have already participated include the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory, the Ya Guang Bakelite Factory, the Wu He Weaving Factory, the China Enamel Factory, and the Hua Feng Steel Refinement Factory, etc. 15 companies. Those who are contacting to participate are still very enthusiastic. After 20 companies are satisfied, they will transport the goods to the exhibition for a scheduled opening. It is expected that it will be established soon.</p>
<h3>Municipal Hospital Officially Opens on Schedule</h3>
<p>The Municipal Hospital and Hygiene Testing Laboratory of this city are the newest medical construction projects in Shanghai. Construction was ordered by the municipal government's Health Bureau in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), and all projects were completed at the end of last year. Work began successively on New Year's Day of the 26th year (1937). According to reliable sources, the two institutions are scheduled to hold their opening ceremonies simultaneously at 2:30 PM on April 3rd. It is said that invitation cards for the ceremony will be sent out soon. With the beautiful spring weather, it is expected that many people will be eager to attend, and the city center will inevitably be bustling with traffic.</p>

<h3>Three Things Businesses Should Note After Income Tax Implementation</h3>
<p>Li Wenjie's Speech at the Civic Auditorium Provides Important Reference for the Business Community</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, accountant Li Wenjie gave a speech entitled "Matters That Businesses Should Pay Attention to in Accounting After the Implementation of Income Tax" at the Civic Joint Association of the First Special District. He provided a very thorough and concrete analysis of various practical issues concerning income tax. It serves as an important reference for the current business community. We have urgently recorded it as follows: The importance of the relationship between income tax and accounting is extremely obvious. Income tax laws and regulations in our country have now begun to be implemented. The business community has already paid close attention to this issue. Today, I will use the provisions of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and its Implementation Rules, as well as the draft of the three types of collection guidelines, as the framework to discuss the accounting matters and issues that are related to it. The accounting I am talking about now is of course industrial and commercial accounting, and it includes bookkeeping techniques. Now, I will explain it in three points: (A) Matters to be prepared immediately, (B) Matters to be noted regularly, and (C) Matters to be noted at the time of final settlement.</p>
<p>(A) Matters to be Prepared Immediately</p>
<p>㊀ Improve incomplete bookkeeping and establish a unified and accurate accounting system. Most industrial and commercial firms in our country are sole proprietorships or partnerships, and the scale is generally small. "Integrity in commerce" and "taking righteousness as profit" are long-standing good habits. Between the capital owner and the managers, between the factory/store and the customers, any major matter is often consistently determined and the formalities are not necessarily complete. As a result, not much attention is paid to bookkeeping, and incomplete shortcomings are naturally unavoidable. Now, because income tax has to be paid, there must be accurate bookkeeping in order to produce accurate profits and losses and provide reliable supporting documents. When paying taxes, many difficulties and disputes can be avoided. Therefore, improving incomplete bookkeeping and establishing a unified and accurate accounting system is a matter that should be prepared immediately. Establishing a unified and accurate accounting system should take into account the business conditions, inherent habits, and operating conditions of each industry. It is not something that can be described in general terms. Now, I can only extract and describe the points that have commonality as follows: 1. The names, types, and functions of accounting books should be clearly defined. 2. The methods of bookkeeping and final settlement should be collectively discussed and jointly followed. 3. The accounting subjects and sub-items used for bookkeeping should strive for comprehensiveness and consistency. For example, the use of "temporary entries" and "miscellaneous items" should be minimized. 4. The formats of receipts, invoices, orders, and other accounting vouchers should be uniform. 5. The forms to be used for settling accounts should have a unified format. 6. The preservation of various contracts, letters, and documents related to business should also be discussed and agreed upon using the same method. All of the above points should be handled immediately. Now is an excellent opportunity to improve the accounting system of various industries because companies and firms in various industries will certainly be happy to engage in it for their own interests. Industry trade associations should take on this responsibility in a timely manner. On the one hand, they should invite experts to recommend a simple, easy-to-implement, unified, and accurate accounting system for the industry. On the other hand, they should organize bookkeeping training courses and send personnel from member factories and stores to attend the training. By doing so, members can achieve the benefits of improving bookkeeping and accurately calculating profits and losses in a short period of time without increasing labor costs or changing staff.</p>
<p>㊁ Solidly organize the records of assets and liabilities and estimate their correct value. This can be discussed in several items. 1. Regarding capital, the amount of capital recorded in the books of general industrial and commercial firms often cannot represent the funds actually used in their operations. For example, undistributed profits from previous years, secret reserves hidden in assets, and long-term loans directly lent to the business by the capital owner are, in nature, no different from capital. Our country's income tax system also uses the profit and actual capital amount to determine the tax rate for non-corporate profit-making enterprises. In theory, there is room for discussion. Therefore, if a profit-making enterprise operates a business with funds that are nominally not capital, it obviously bears an unfair burden in terms of taxation. Therefore, the first step for each company and firm should be to quickly and accurately calculate its actual capital amount to avoid paying taxes meaninglessly at a loss. However, one point should not be forgotten: if it is a corporate organization, the articles of association should be revised for capital increase registration; if it has been registered as a commercial firm, the registered capital amount should be changed, and the partnership agreement should be revised. As for those who have not or have handled company registration or commercial firm registration, they should take this opportunity to complete the registration procedures because obtaining a license from the Ministry of Industry is, of course, the most powerful proof of the actual amount of capital. 2. Regarding other liabilities, the most important of other liabilities of general industrial and commercial firms is the deposits absorbed from relatives and friends. Usually, only a mark or shop name is recorded in the sub-account ledger. Only the handler knows the true name and address of the depositor. Now, because firms that absorb deposits should bear the obligation of withholding income tax, the account names in the books should be clear and detailed. If a mark or shop name is used to open an account, the true name, address, and interest rate should be added under the account. If it is a fixed-term deposit, the due date should also be recorded. When transferring to a new book in subsequent years, it should also be handled in the same way. This is not only for the convenience of withholding income tax, but even if the handler leaves the job, others can continue to manage the accounts, receive and pay funds without any difficulty. 3. Regarding current assets, A. Cash: The amount of cash balance on the books of many industrial and commercial institutions often cannot match the actual amount in the treasury. The difference is the amount of various types of outstanding accounts, such as employee outstanding debts and returned promissory notes. Employee outstanding debts are originally a bad habit and should be eliminated. Even if there is an urgent need, it should be treated as an outstanding account and paid off, and must never be kept outstanding in the cash inventory for a long time. As for accounts receivable on forward promissory notes, they should also be listed in the "accounts receivable promissory notes" subject. On the one hand, the figures expressed in the accounting books can accurately represent the true financial situation. Moreover, according to Article 19 of the draft Guidelines for the First Category of Collection, uncollectible accounts receivable promissory notes are allowed to be listed as bad debt losses. Setting up a separate subject of accounts receivable promissory notes can also facilitate investigation. B. Inventory or raw materials: When general industrial and commercial firms purchase goods, in addition to recording the debt owed for the purchase price in the goods source book by household, the receipt and delivery of the goods themselves are often not recorded, but the inventory is taken once at the time of final settlement to determine the profit and loss. This is not a perfect approach. In the future, in order to facilitate the settlement of accounts at any time, the profit and loss should be recorded in detail every month, and the existing goods should be checked to prevent leakage. Separate books should also be set up for the receipt and delivery of goods for recording and investigation. When settling accounts every year, the physical inventory should be taken again. If a difference loss is found between the amount recorded in the books and the amount of the physical inventory, it should be adjusted with the "inventory consumption" subject. Regarding inventory or raw materials, there is another point, that is, if the original valuation on the books is too low (commonly known as thick bottom), the firm can estimate the accurate price allowed by law according to the principle of taking the lower of cost and market price. The so-called market price, according to Article 5 of the First Category Collection Guidelines, refers to the prevailing price in the local market at the time of settlement. The price jointly formulated by the local chamber of commerce or trade association is naturally regarded as the prevailing price in the market. 4. Regarding fixed assets, long-established and stable industrial and commercial institutions, in order to prevent business decline, often make extreme depreciation of assets such as houses, land, machinery, tools, and living things, so that they are far from the actual price. This is a constant example. In order to prevent tax evasion, the income tax law has to crack down on unreasonable hidden profits. Therefore, many meticulous asset valuation methods have been attached to the first category collection guidelines for compliance. This is a matter for the future. When the income tax begins to be implemented, industrial and commercial operators should check whether the value expressed on the books of all existing assets is real. If it is too low, then underestimating assets is underestimating capital, which is increasing the burden of income tax. In order to eliminate this shortcoming, the value should be re-estimated in a practical manner to achieve the purpose of accurately representing the financial situation. As for the various fixed assets, their names, quantities, original prices, market prices, years of use, and currently estimated prices should be recorded separately as a basis for future depreciation and investigation. If there are relevant supporting documents, such as construction contracts, sales contracts, and various invoices and receipts, they should also be kept separately for proof. 5. Regarding branch store accounts, Article 6 of the Implementation Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that if the head office and its branches and business offices are all within the territory of the Republic of China and their capital is divided among themselves, their income should be calculated separately. Article 2 of the Draft Guidelines for the First Category Collection stipulates that the division of capital between the head office and its branches referred to in the Implementation Rules refers to the capital and business of the branches being completely independent. According to the above regulations, if an industrial and commercial institution has branches opened in other places, the business负责人 should examine the actual situation and decide whether it is necessary to divide the capital between the head office and the branches. In the future, the transactions between the branches and the head office should be sorted out in a practical and clear manner, and no ambiguity should be allowed. 6. Regarding investments in affiliated businesses, it is common for an industrial and commercial institution to independently establish profit-making businesses of different natures in the same or different places due to certain needs. However, capital is often not independently divided. Instead, the name of a reciprocal account is used to allow the use of funds, and the profit and loss at the end of the year can also be disposed of at will. After the implementation of income tax, problems will arise. According to the law, capital should be divided and business should be operated independently. This is also a matter that needs to be prepared immediately. 7. Regarding loss and profit accounts, the most important point is that for the accounts of sales and purchases of general industrial and commercial firms, in addition to indicating the debts owed for the purchases in the accounts in the goods source book and the claims arising from the sales in the accounts in the customer book, which are asset and liability books, and recording the daily transactions in the business books, which are auxiliary books of a running nature, there is a lack of a comprehensive and continuous record of the quantity and amount of sales and purchases in the general ledger. The closing balance of the account is only sufficient to indicate the received part of the accounts receivable and is not sufficient to indicate all credit transactions. Therefore, the investigation of the business situation must be added up day by day and household by household, and it cannot be seen at a glance. If "total sales" and "total purchases" accounts are set up in the general ledger, and the transactions of cash purchases, credit purchases, cash sales, and credit sales are recorded separately, the accounting purposes can be achieved with only a slight increase in the procedure. In addition, such as the receipt of accounts receivable, all the roundings and changes, etc., should be set up separately as a subject for sorting out.</p>
<p>㊂ Pay attention to studying the content of the income tax law. Since the relationship between income tax laws and regulations and industry and commerce is extremely close, industrial and commercial operators should thoroughly understand its content, especially the procedures for declaration, investigation, and review, and should study it at any time. If there are any opinions, they should be contributed to the government so that the implementation of the income tax law will not encounter obstacles, and the system itself can be improved day by day. In the future, they should also pay attention to court precedents, resolutions of review committees, explanatory letters and orders of the Ministry of Finance, and theoretical explorations by experts and scholars at any time, so that they can almost cope with everything at ordinary times, and when difficulties or disputes arise, they can calmly handle them at their discretion. This kind of attention and research is continuous. It is best to be led by the Chamber of Commerce or the Industry Association for greater effectiveness.</p>
<p>㊃ Whether to declare the absorption of deposits and capital, etc. According to the announcement of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, if industrial and commercial institutions receive deposits, they should report to the local offices before the end of February of this year. Companies, commercial firms, factories, and profit-making individuals should also report their brand names, addresses, responsible person's name, operating capital or paid-in capital before the end of February. If it is a limited company or a limited partnership with shares, the total number of shares, types, amount per share, and operating year should also be reported.</p>

<h3>New Directors of the Public Concession's Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The US and Japan Have Already Nominated, the British Position Is Still Vacant</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the new directors of the Public Concession's Municipal Council will be elected by foreign taxpayers on April 5th and 6th. The number of seats is two each for the US and Japan, and five for the UK. The US candidates have recently been nominated by the US Community Committee in this city, namely current director Mr. Fessenden, a lawyer, and Mr. Bland, the new president of the US Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. The Japanese candidates were also announced last Friday by the presidents of the Japanese Association and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in this city, namely Mr. Yamamoto, director of the Shanghai branch of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, and Mr. Ube, president of the Shanghai branch of Mitsubishi Corporation. Both are current directors. The UK candidates have not yet been nominated. It is said that of the current five directors, except for Mr. Brett, the remaining four will leave Shanghai due to business or other reasons, so they are unwilling to be re-elected and others need to be nominated. It is said that the British Community Association in this city has decided to hold a meeting within days to nominate them. Although there are only five seats, there will be at least ten candidates nominated. As for the Chinese directors, there are also five seats, and they can be selected within days. Therefore, judging from the current situation, since the nominated candidates are equal to the statutory number of seats, the candidates do not need to compete in this election, and foreign taxpayers do not need to vote. The new directors can be decided. Furthermore, although the Japanese community has only nominated two candidates this time, the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun in this city still published an editorial stating that this move by the Japanese community does not mean that it has given up its advocacy of increasing the number of Japanese directors to three.</p>

<h3>A Young Man Associates with Boatmen</h3>

<h3>Civic Association Writes to the Municipal Council to Speed Up the Construction of Low-Cost Housing</h3>
<p>To Avoid Tens of Thousands of Shantytown Dwellers Becoming Homeless</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Civic Joint Association of the First Special District wrote to the Municipal Council regarding the Municipal Council's deadline for the demolition of shantytowns on various roads in the Hongkou District, stating that, according to reports from shantytown representatives Tang Anping, Wang Qiben, Sun Hankui, and others in the Hongkou District, the Municipal Council has set a deadline of May 1 of this year for all shantytowns on Dalian Bay Road, Yulin Road, Qiwupu Road, Pingliang Road, Lanhua Road, Yangshupu Road, and Zhaofeng Road, and the boundary road of the concession to be relocated voluntarily, otherwise the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council will demolish them. This has caused extreme panic among the shantytown dwellers in the area, and they have come to the association one after another to ask for help. The shantytown problem was previously suggested by this association to the Municipal Council to raise funds to build low-cost housing to accommodate them in order to gradually eliminate shantytowns. It was later learned that the Municipal Council had a plan to implement the construction of low-cost housing, which was a source of great joy. However, the Municipal Council suddenly ordered the demolition of shantytowns on various roads in the Hongkou District, disregarding the livelihood of tens of thousands of shantytown dwellers and allowing them to become homeless. The impact of this is enough to become a burden on public security, and this association cannot remain silent. Therefore, we are writing to the Municipal Council to ask it to consider the livelihood of the poor and not demolish the shantytowns, and to speed up the realization of the construction of low-cost housing in order to seek a fundamental solution.</p>

The audience surrounded the enclosure and were reluctant to leave after careful examination, causing those who came late to regret their visit. At around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Mr. Chu Minyi specially introduced French Ambassador Naziat to visit, and he also praised it endlessly. There were eight additional exhibits yesterday, including a screen with portraits of ladies by Bin Shi, a pair of jade Yang Tai Zhen dancing statues, a pair of yellow jade palace lanterns, and a crystal ball. There were also two pieces of jade rough, one of which was standing upright in the shape of the God of Longevity, with its whole body covered with yellow stone and scattered with emerald green spots on top. It is said that there will also be a pair of emerald table screens, with a total of twelve pieces, carved with the twelve flower gods, with very exquisite craftsmanship, which will be displayed today and tomorrow. As for the emerald pagoda, which is praised as the "three wonders of rarity", its value is rumored to be different. According to reporters, the pagoda is unparalleled in the world, so it is difficult to estimate its price. However, when it was shipped to the United States for export last time, the customs valuation was 1 million yuan in cost, while the valuation of the American jeweler was 275,000 US dollars, which is equivalent to 1.1 million yuan in national currency. It is said that the product will not be extended due to packaging and transportation, and important figures in Beijing, such as Chairman Lin, will come to Shanghai to visit.</p>

The agenda was as follows: ① Notify members that when declaring income tax, the actual amount of capital and the total amount of deposits received, regardless of the scope or size of the store, must be declared on the form to avoid misunderstandings during inspections. ② Weng Bingyao proposed whether the office should set up facilities to study income tax and improve bookkeeping.

It was decided to notify members to come to the office to prepay cash and register before 12:00 AM every period 2•4•6. After the quota is full, report to the bank and set every Monday•Wednesday•Friday to send to the meeting for exchange. Those who do not prepay cash registration will be deemed to have given up on their own. ④ Colleagues sell various cigars. Because the boxes are opened and sold out of the case, the inspectors of the Shanghai Inspection Office recently mistakenly referred to it as a tax evasion case. It was decided that the chairman should negotiate with the Inspection Office and ask them to return the deducted goods and notify members that if they sell various Yun cigars in the future, such as one hundred, fifty, twenty-five, or original boxes, or paper bags, all printed flower wrapping paper should not leave the cigar branch. Ten packs should not be out of the case, otherwise, it is easy to cause misunderstandings and be deducted and punished. ⑤ Members asked for a deduction of the grade collection of tobacco and alcohol licenses. It was decided to find out whether the reported grades of each number are consistent and should be persuaded to pay separately to benefit both the tax and the merchant. ⑥ Members requested to replace the summer license on behalf of the council. It was decided that Zhang Songji would continue to be responsible and follow the usual practice. ⑦ It is necessary to rectify the unified market price to avoid the citizens' excuse and maintain the livelihood of the industry.

<h3>Shen Museum Curator's Birthday Gift Moved to Help the Capital's National Hospital</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Zhongfang, Curator of the National Medical Branch in this city, is known for his kindness and has been praised by society. This month, the 10th is Mr. Shen's 60th birthday celebration. Friends and acquaintances have all planned to celebrate his birthday with a banquet. Mr. Shen, with the national crisis at stake, did not want to be extravagant and repeatedly declined. It happened that the funds for the construction of the National Hospital in the capital were insufficient and were being raised. Therefore, Chen Lifu, Chairman of the Central National Medical Center, and Jiao Yitang, Curator, and other gentlemen, initiated the request that the birthday greetings from all gentlemen be converted into cash to help the National Hospital, and Mr. Shen was willing to use the funds for the banquet as his personal special donation, both of which were donated. Those who heard this unanimously agreed. Now, it has been entrusted to the Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road in this city to collect the birthday gifts. In recent days, there have been many people who have gone to send money. According to Mr. Shen's declaration yesterday, I am not talented and virtuous, and I did not dare to celebrate my birthday. Because the Capital National Hospital is a public welfare undertaking in society, I am a National Doctor, and I must donate as much as I can. Moreover, I am honored by the kindness of Chen and Jiao, and how can I refuse? I will not set up a auditorium or prepare a banquet, which can both avoid killing and save materials and resources. All the money received will be donated to the National Hospital to help the good deeds and save lives. Take the grand ceremony of celebrating your birthday as a resource to create blessings for the people. I sincerely hope that comrades from all over the world and philanthropists at home and abroad can help the Capital National Hospital when there are celebrations, so that the collection of armpits can be successful.</p>

<h3>: Woman Dies by Poisoning Due to Incurable Hidden Illness</h3>
<p>A woman named Cao from Shaoxing, thirty-four years old this year, married Long Haijin (forty years old this year), a Sichuanese who worked as a cook. They lived in a room in the Suzhou native Gu Xiangqing's house, No. 211, Ma Lang Road, in the French Concession. The couple had a good relationship, but she was infertile and suffered from syphilis, which had been treated repeatedly, but ultimately it would flare up and then recede, and she could not be completely cured. Recently, it recurred and became uncontrollable, causing ulcers in her lower body and unbearable pain. Medical treatment was ineffective, leading Ms. Cao to feel that life was meaningless, and she developed the idea of ​​despairing of the world. The day before yesterday, early in the morning, she went out to buy raw opium, returned home, and secretly swallowed it to commit suicide. By noon, she was poisoned. The sub-landlord discovered it and immediately hired a car to send Ms. Cao to Renji Hospital, while notifying her husband. However, Ms. Cao had been deeply poisoned and the rescue was ineffective. She died at one o'clock in the afternoon. The hospital reported to the French police station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall morgue. The next day, they reported to Judge Wang Ren of the Second Special Court, who, together with the forensic scribe, arrived at the morgue. It was verified that Long Cao had indeed died by consuming raw opium before death. After questioning her husband and the sub-landlord, he ordered that the body be handed over to her husband, Long Haisheng, after signing a guarantee for the collection.</p>

<p>Three Measures Decided to Assist the Bereaved Families</p>
<p>The Lake Society of this city held a discussion meeting for the bereaved families of the Yongxin Wheel disaster at the society at 1:00 PM yesterday. In addition to the society's committee members Pan Gongzhan and Shen Jiesheng, representatives from the Wujiang County Government, Pingwang Police Station, Wujiang No. 8 District Office, Pingwang Chamber of Commerce, the First Administrative Inspectorate of Zhejiang Province, the Wuxing County Government, the Shanghai Tongxiang Association of Wujiang, and the bereaved families all attended. The chairman, Shen Tianxin, reported the purpose of the meeting, and then Huang Ren, the head of the Pingwang Public Security Bureau, reported:</p>
<p>Important Report　He stated briefly that the bureau only received the report two hours after the sinking of the Yongxin Wheel. He immediately telegraphed the Shanghai Yongshun Company and sent police to the scene of the accident, together with the water police patrol boat, to supervise the recovery of corpses and objects. Throughout the day, no one from the Yongshun Shipping Company was seen, nor was any report received from the Yongshun Company. The so-called heavy machinery from the company departed from Shanghai at 11:00 AM on the 4th and arrived at Pingwang on the 5th. Several boatmen came with it, claiming they would only salvage the ship and refused to salvage the corpses. This was what was agreed upon by the Yongshun Company. After repeated discussions, it was agreed that 5 yuan would be paid for each corpse salvaged. However, due to the large number of corpses, it was not until the afternoon of the 7th that all were salvaged, a total of 54 corpses.</p>
<p>Three Requests　Subsequently, Wu Lusheng, Wang Zhaoji, Liu Enzhen, Lu Jingxian, and others from the bereaved families successively expressed their opinions, expressing deep indignation at the company's improper handling and requesting three points: ㊀ Strictly punish the employees who caused the accident, ㊁ Compensate for the losses according to the law, ㊂ Request the Lake Society to uphold justice and provide assistance to the best of its ability.</p>
<p>Lake Society's Assistance　Finally, lawyer Wang from the Lake Society's legal team expressed two points based on the facts: ㊀ The Lake Society, standing as a fellow native organization, will do its best to assist in the administrative part. ㊁ As for the judicial part, the Wujiang County Government, which also handles judicial affairs, is already investigating, and each family can follow the summons for interrogation. It was decided to implement three measures: ㊀ The Lake Society will invite the person in charge of Yongshun Company to discuss again, ㊁ Regarding the administrative aspects, the Lake Society will do its best to assist each bereaved family, ㊂ The Lake Society will compile the reports from all parties and send them to the Wujiang County Government for prosecution. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>Economic Special Issue</p>
<h3>Adjusting the World's Currency</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xie Juceng</p>
<p>This article is from Professor Ganmoer's new book, published in the recent issue of Nation's Business magazine, specially translated for reference.</p>
<p>On September 26, 1936, the long-anticipated collapse of the French gold standard was formally announced. The French government, to make it sound more appealing, euphemistically stated that it was suggesting to the parliament to "adjust the currency," followed by the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, and Czechoslovakia, quickly making similar announcements.</p>
<p>Simultaneous with the French declaration, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France announced that they had established an agreement to strive for stability in international exchange rates. Although the wording of the three governments' statements was not identical, the nature was entirely the same.</p>
<p>According to U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's statement, the purpose of the agreement was to maintain "the greatest possible balance in the international exchange rate system." The three governments agreed to "avoid, as much as possible, the potential disturbances to the international exchange rate basis caused by this proposed adjustment," and invited other countries to cooperate, whereupon Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands were invited to join successively.</p>
<p>(I) The Movement of Gold</p>
<p>On October 13, a supplementary agreement was announced. According to the U.S. side, this move was the U.S.'s "intention" to "sell gold to various countries for immediate export or designated for use in balancing or stabilizing exchange rate funds. And these countries must similarly express their willingness to sell gold to the United States, under conditions satisfactory to the United States." The selling agency was the New York Federal Reserve Bank representing the Treasury Department, with the price set at US$35 per ounce, plus a handling fee of 0.15%.</p>
<p>On the same day, the U.S. announced that Britain and France had complied with the terms of the agreement, and thus this plan became effective among the three countries.</p>
<p>Those who have always been concerned about this issue were not surprised by this supplementary agreement. Because it was recognized that if France abandoned the gold standard, it would be necessary to establish such an agreement in order to continue international gold settlements. The reasons can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department has long stipulated that gold exports from the country are limited to countries on the gold standard that can maintain a fixed gold buying and selling price. Because whenever natural economic trends cause gold to flow into the United States, the United States can only reasonably expect to obtain gold from these countries. The countries that meet this requirement are France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, with France being particularly important. The United States, of course, is not among them. As for France itself, it has never restricted gold exports, and U.S. payments to other countries, including gold exports, often flowed into France. To facilitate gold exports, the Bank of France specifically established a basic reference point for the value of gold, also serving as a means for other countries to transfer gold deposits among themselves.</p>
<p>When France, Belgium, and the Netherlands abandoned the gold standard, they completely broke this agreement. Therefore, U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced a supplementary agreement on January 13 to replace it. This was a new clear agreement among the three countries on gold settlements, inviting other countries to join. The agreement allowed each of the three countries to use its stabilization fund to convert the amount owed to other countries into gold at the agreed exchange rate, or to allocate gold held overseas to its domestic account, or to transport gold from the country for this purpose.</p>
<p>The practical result of this implementation is to restrict the movement of gold between the countries concerned for those countries and government agencies affected by the stabilization fund. Therefore, the role of the supplementary agreement is simply a tool of the first agreement.</p>
<p>The essence of the two agreements includes the following three items:</p>
<p>(1) The world's two most important countries are actually cooperating under a plan, from a monetary standpoint, to seek exchange rate stability. Given the breakdown of the World Economic Conference three years ago, and the volatility of international exchange rates in recent years, this move in itself is a truly progressive approach.</p>
<p>(2) The plan establishes an international clearing mechanism, serving as the basis for international gold settlement.</p>
<p>(3) The plan includes a declaration of intent to reduce the numerous international trade restrictions that have emerged in recent years, as such restrictions have a significant impact on currency disturbances and exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
<p>(II) The Importance of Balance Outweighs Stability</p>
<p>However, there are still some things not included in the exchange rate stabilization agreement. First, they did not specify the monetary basis for stabilizing international exchange rates. They focused on maintaining the balance of exchange rates, but they did not say anything about important issues such as the monetary unit on which the balance is based, or the method of standard. Looking at the entire agreement, its basic plan may be the gold standard, the silver standard, the bimetallic standard, the price index standard, or even any well-managed currency. Clearly, exchange rates can be kept in balance either in a situation of rapid inflation, or in a situation of rapid deflation, or in a situation of stable prices, assuming that the general price changes between countries are the same. At the same time, this agreement can be interpreted and implemented to cater to the wishes of the orthodox proponents of the gold standard, and can also be interpreted and implemented to satisfy the desires of those who advocate the commodity currency standard.</p>
<p>Second, this agreement does not specify a definite period, but is merely a day-to-day approach. A clause like "exchange rate stability" or "exchange rate balance" usually cannot fix the relative value between different currencies for a long period of time. Therefore, the "exchange rate stabilization agreement" among the three countries can be canceled every day, as long as any party involved lacks the element of stability, they can come forward and argue.</p>
<p>This plan may tolerate the introduction of a better situation for some time; it may collapse at any time in the exchange rate war. The devaluation of the currencies of France, the Netherlands, Italy, and Switzerland as a result of artificial stimulation is sufficient to benefit the export trade of these countries, but in this situation, how Germany, Russia, and Japan will choose their currency policies is indeed a serious matter.</p>
<p>France's new monetary law authorizes the government to reduce the gold content of the franc from 25% to 34%. Switzerland also enacted similar laws, reducing the gold content of the Swiss franc from 30% to 40%. Italy reduced the gold content of the lira to 40% to 50%. As for the Netherlands, it did not announce a specific ratio, temporarily allowing the guilder to float on the exchange rate market.</p>
<p>Almost every country that devalued its currency obtained a stabilization or balance fund, generated from the so-called "devaluation profit." The so-called devaluation profit is the value of the gold reserve, expressed in the difference between the gold content of the old currency and the gold content of the new currency. For example, the gold reserve of France, from its old value devalued to 74.8% of the gold content of the franc, was re-evaluated on this basis, resulting in a "gold profit" of approximately 17,000,000,000 francs, all owned by the government. Of this amount, 10,000,000,000 francs—equivalent to approximately US$466,000,000 at the current price—were separately allocated to establish a balance fund, managed by the Bank of France to maintain the value of the franc within the limits prescribed by law.</p>
<p>The impact of exchange rate transactions and gold movements caused by this huge stabilization fund is controlled by the governments concerned, mostly carried out secretly by the central banks of various countries.</p>
<p>In summary, this is my judgment, that the recent successive devaluations of the gold bloc countries, as well as the plan for international currency stabilization, all indicate progress towards currency stability. I further believe that when the time comes, it will force international currency to stabilize on a gold basis, for which the reasons may be traced back to past history.</p>
<p>(III) The Pursuit of the Gold Standard</p>
<p>When the European War broke out in 1914, almost all advanced countries were using the gold standard—a standard they had reached after centuries of experimentation with and criticism of other standards—the gold standard was not working perfectly, but it was much better than the silver standard, bimetallic standard, and managed paper standard that prevailed in the past. People generally believed that the gold standard was the currency standard with the best performance in past experiments, and the real question for the future was not the issue of replacing the gold standard with some other standard, but how to make the gold standard a more superior international currency standard.</p>
<p>During the Great War and the first two years after the war, currency standards collapsed almost everywhere, and every gold standard country abandoned it. Although the United States' departure from the gold standard was not as severe as other countries, it also had to restrict gold exports. As for other currency standards, they also declared bankruptcy, and even some countries implemented a managed paper standard during the war, experiencing extreme currency depreciation.</p>
<p>When the war ended, countries were determined to quickly restore the gold standard, which obviously greatly increased the demand for gold, and if the pre-war currency units were still used, the result would be a sharp drop in prices. If all countries restored the gold standard to the high price level of the United States in 1920, then there would not be enough gold in the world for circulation. Sure enough, in the late 1920s and early 1921, the anticipated price collapse arrived. Within a year, U.S. wholesale prices fell by 44%, which also represents an 80% increase in the value of gold.</p>
<p>This increase in the value of gold greatly encouraged gold production, and thus the gold mining industry, which had been severely hit during the war, quickly recovered.</p>
<p>After the peace treaty was signed, most of the gold hoarded and inactive during the war was released into circulation. The world slowly and resolutely returned to the gold standard. The outflow of this hoarded gold, together with the increase in gold mine production, and the improvement in methods of saving gold in currency use, were sufficient to meet the needs arising from the restoration of the gold standard. By 1927, most countries had restored the gold basis. As for the value of gold, measured by its purchasing power over goods, it was simply extremely stable from the late 1921s until the outbreak of the world panic in the late 1929s.</p>
<p>(IV) Devaluing the Value of Gold</p>
<p>Many countries' restoration of the gold standard did not want to rebuild their pre-war gold parity, but to stabilize on the greatly devalued gold value in their paper currency units at that time. In other words, they were stabilizing on the gold value that represented their true face at the time. For example, France stabilized the franc at US$0.0392, instead of the pre-war US$0.193; Italy stabilized at US$0.0526, instead of the pre-war US$0.193. As for some countries that had experienced crazy inflation, such as Poland, Germany, etc., they created new currency units, representing a huge multiple of the value of the paper money circulating at that time. For example, Germany stipulated that one hundred trillion paper marks were equivalent to one gold mark.</p>
<p>This stabilization method can minimize the disturbances to current prices and wages caused by this. However, a small number of European countries, whose currencies had been devalued, then began to restore their pre-war gold currency units, with Britain being the most prominent. Once the exchange controls maintained during the war were lifted, the gold value of the pound sterling immediately fell. Until February 1920, it fell to US$3.195. After that, it slowly rose, but encountered many obstacles and some strong reactions, until the spring of 1926, when the gold standard was re-established at the old gold parity.</p>
<p>When Britain restored the gold standard to US$4.87 per pound sterling, it went through a long and painful process of deflation, raising the gold value of the pound sterling from an extremely low level by 52%. Their government adopted this deflation plan, disregarding the advice of many famous economists and financial experts in their country, and also ignoring the criticisms of general famous economists in other countries. And the economic difficulties that Britain encountered in these years and the following years cannot but be attributed to this violent deflation policy.</p>
<p>During most of the period from 1921 to 1929, British prices showed a strong decline, but at the same time, U.S. prices, measured by the famous U.S. index, were relatively more stable.</p>
<p>The contraction of the pound sterling made British export trade suffer a lot. Because the gold value of the pound sterling rose, the amount of money received by exporters from foreign countries was less and less when converted into pounds sterling. For example, if he exported goods to the United States and sold them for US$100,000, assuming the exchange rate was US$3.33 1/3, he could receive £30,000; if the exchange rate rose to US$4, he would only get £25,000. And in fact, the decline in the cost of exporters was definitely not as fast as the rise in the gold value of the pound sterling.</p>
<p>Deflation also increased the British government's post-war financial burden, because it raised the value of the pound sterling used to pay off large amounts of domestic debt and pensions. And the most important thing was that the rise in the gold value of the pound sterling could not reduce wages, because the British trade unions were very powerful, and their resistance was very effective. This increased the cost of British exports competing in overseas markets. Therefore, during most of this period, British export trade was greatly weakened, and it could no longer compete with important rivals such as the United States and Germany in the world market. Because Britain is an island country, with a small territory, the welfare of the United Kingdom relies on her foreign trade, far more than her main competitors.</p>
<p>When the panic of 1929 began, prices in gold standard countries around the world fell sharply, and confidence was reduced to a low point everywhere. The world scrambled for gold for safety, and at that time, measured by prices, the value of gold was extremely high.</p>
<p>Britain had undergone a long period of deflation, during which she raised the value of the paper currency from approximately 3.195 gold dollars to 4.87 gold dollars. When she restored the paper currency to gold parity, before she could catch her breath, the value of gold itself soared due to the world economic panic, thus putting her on a further path of deflation.</p>
<p>Britain's gold standard finally ran out of steam and declared bankruptcy. On September 21, 1931, it stopped gold payments. The gold value of the pound sterling quickly plummeted. In 1935, it was on average about 4% lower than the old U.S. dollar exchange rate.</p>
<p>(V) Heavy Blows to the World Currency System</p>
<p>Originally, the world monetary system had already suffered major pressure due to the world economic panic, and at this point, it was hit hard by the collapse of the pound sterling. Since Britain broke away from the gold standard, the gold standards of most of the British territories and colonies, the Nordic countries, and some South American countries were also kicked over by Britain, disrupting the world's currency and causing many exchange rate wars.</p>
<p>In the next few years, one country after another successively abandoned the gold standard, and even the United States, which had the largest gold supply in the world, joined this group in early 1933. At the beginning of 1936, only a few countries were left that still retained the pre-recession gold standard, and Belgium and the United States returned to the gold standard after devaluing their currencies.</p>
<p>This situation caused disorder in international trade and international finance. It is a universally recognized principle that when the foreign exchange value of a country's currency unit declines, its export trade will be stimulated, and the import of goods will be hit. The decline in exchange rates acts like an import tax on import trade, but this is a temporary phenomenon. Once prices and wages are able to return to equilibrium, this phenomenon disappears, and this stimulation of exports and hindrance of imports is part of the mechanical action of returning to equilibrium. But this process takes time, often involves pain, and because the exchange rate stimulates exports, they are not welcomed by the other country, and as a result, they must impose various restrictions on what is called exchange rate dumping.</p>
<p>On the other hand, using a devalued currency to impose a special burden on a country's import trade can create new and broad benefits in uneconomical industries. In this situation, everyone competes in the market, eventually leading to a large number of restrictions and prohibitions piling up on international trade.</p>
<p>Such exchange rate wars have affected almost every country. If a logical conclusion is sought, it can be summarized into a reductio ad absurdum argument. A country adopts a policy of continuously devaluing its currency to stimulate exports and hinder imports, so that more and more of its goods are sent to foreigners, while fewer and fewer goods are received from foreigners. A country cannot get rich in this way.</p>
<p>(VI) An International Gold Unit Will Inevitably Be Re-established</p>
<p>During this exchange rate war, countries that did not devalue their currencies were greatly harmed. They lost the export market of countries with cheap currencies. Making their domestic industries suffer unfortunate reactions, affecting a country's budget. If these countries have sufficient and solid economic and political power to resist such attacks until domestic and foreign price exchange rates return to equilibrium, then there is of course no problem. They can ignore it, and even prove that the suffering they have suffered is less than that of the devaluing countries. Unfortunately, the opposite is true, putting them in a very difficult position.</p>
<p>The recent devaluations of France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, and Czechoslovakia can make their currency units gradually balance with the currency units of countries that have already devalued, and can remove many of the obstacles that these gold bloc countries have encountered in competing in world export trade in recent years, and can make these newly devalued countries compete with the countries that have already devalued, becoming stronger rivals than in the past.</p>
<p>All of these situations, if the countries concerned move forward according to the policy, and no longer re-enter the vortex of new exchange rate wars due to temporary favorable and unfavorable shifts in foreign trade competition caused by recent currency devaluations, then it is not difficult to move towards a more stable balance.</p>
<p>Although the agreement does not stipulate the need to return to the gold standard, I dare to believe that the logical result of such an agreement will be to re-establish an international gold standard. Such a gold standard is the only basis on which the permanent equilibrium of international exchange rates stipulated in the agreement can be maintained. Naturally, such a gold standard cannot be completely automatic. All currencies must be managed to some extent. Assuming that any permanent and stable international exchange rate plan is launched, the close cooperation of central banks of various countries is also necessary.</p>
<p>Today, there is no consensus on the merits of the silver standard or the bimetallic standard. A few places, such as Britain, the United States, and the Nordic countries, have a very strong public opinion, in favor of some form of managed currency or commodity standard. But even in these countries, the general rational view tends towards the gold standard. Of course, this situation is especially true in the United States.</p>
<p>We may take the statement in the famous Macmillan Report a few months before Britain broke away from the gold standard in 1931 as the conclusion of this article.</p>
<p>"...Perhaps there is no more important goal within the scope of human skills than to make the world achieve a complete scientific monetary system. But to make the world monetary system become a whole one as soon as possible, there is probably little or no hope of progress, unless it evolves from the historical gold standard...</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>Cloth Sales Surge</p>
<p>U.S. Cotton Prices Rise Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with extremely active trading. Prices rose by 14 to 25 points for various months due to large-scale purchases by the public, foreign firms, industry players, and speculators. The rise in the Liverpool and Egyptian markets, and cloth sales reaching 80 million yards, also contributed to the price increase. Later, long positions were closed and cotton farmers hedged their sales, causing a partial reaction. However, sales volume was absorbed. The current cotton situation is still tight. The Commodity Loan Corporation reported that, as of the 4th, 615,641 bales of cotton pledged had been sold. The recent increase in new outside investors and fears of international inflation have led to extremely high market prices. Spot prices rose by 17 points, and futures prices rose by 16 to 23 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 18 points, and futures prices rose by 21.2 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to favorable foreign news, then retraced due to profit-taking. However, due to large-scale purchases and short covering, market prices rose again. Pingguoer rose by 5 to 5.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 5.75 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 6 to 6.5 rupees. Original telegram excerpt (dated 6th)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for the 8th is: Bairoxi at 238.5 rupees, Pingguoer at 189.5 rupees, both up by 0.5 rupees, and Aomula at 221.25 rupees, up by 0.25 rupees.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Sub-White Japonica Rises and Falls</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were few ships arriving from the river downstream routes, only 15 or 16. Sales of various goods in the market were average. Top-grade white japonica was slightly weak by a small number of points, while mid-grade goods were stable. Lower-grade goods were slightly tight. The market turned weak later. Early rice arrivals were scarce, and although transactions were not brisk, prices were firm. The top grade of thin rice prices barely stood, while medium and lower grades showed a soft trend. Scattered transactions were sluggish due to cloudy weather. The market was flat and weak. Other rice varieties were similar to the previous market.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over twenty source groups, with a total of 4,300 to 4,400 shi of goods. Sales in this street market were moving, but the appetite was not strong. Only Tianjin, Qingdao, Xi'an, and other groups handled 1,500 to 1,600 packages of thin rice. Therefore, although the arrival of goods was not large, the market condition was only average. The prices of thick and thin japonica were slightly firm for zero sales, while wholesale prices remained at the original level. The supply and demand of Dujian and Yinyuan were similar, and there was no difference.</p>
<h3>A Review of American Economic Conditions and Raw Silk Consumption (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Tian Yu</p>
<p>The above clearly demonstrates to us that: (1) Although last year's silk prices did not reach the high levels of the previous year after October, they maintained a price of US$1.67 per pound and exceeded the previous year's average price of US$1.56 per pound almost every month; (2) When compared to the same period in the previous year, the extent of the increase was even greater, with some months reaching nearly 30%. Even when comparing the average price over nine months, there was still an increase of around 17%; (3) The average price per pound for these nine months was US$1.6683, which is a significant increase of over 34.3% compared to the average price of US$1.242 per pound in 1934. This is something that deserves special attention.</p>
<p>Based on observations from various sources regarding employment rates and industrial rates, which can indicate the degree of general purchasing power recovery, the indices for January to March of last year showed an increase of approximately 3-6% compared to the same period in 1934. However, the trend of real wages stagnated due to the rise in the cost of living in the middle of last year. According to government publications, national income increased by approximately 14%, or US$60 million, compared to 1934. Therefore, the estimated increase in general purchasing power is about 10% or less. However, the price of raw silk exceeded that of 1934 by as much as 34.3%. Even if the purchasing power of raw silk increased in proportion to the general purchasing power, it would still be about a quarter less than in 1934. Naturally, the only way to compensate for this reduction rate is to reduce consumption. This explains why last year's silk consumption in the United States (average over nine months) decreased by 15-25% compared to the previous year and 1934.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the increase in purchasing power in the United States was offset by the rise in the cost of living. In particular, since last year, the prices of agricultural products have risen slightly due to the drought, food costs have increased significantly, and the prices of heavy industrial products have also increased, forcing up the cost of housing, fuel, and lighting. In this environment of rising living costs, expenditure on clothing has shown a downward trend month by month. Therefore, raw silk, in the laggard increase of living costs in the United States, had to retreat in the consumer competition. The table below shows this:</p>
<p>Because of the decrease in spending on clothing, the demand for essential clothing items could not be reduced in proportion. Therefore, consideration had to be given to the materials used. Although wool enjoyed particularly good fortune the year before (consumption increased by 78% compared to 1934), last year it had to be replaced by cotton and rayon. If that was the case for wool, it was certainly the case for raw silk, this is the first point. The increase in agricultural product prices caused the price of cotton, a commodity produced and supplied by the United States itself, to increase accordingly. However, precisely because it is a domestic product, it is generally promoted more. Raw silk, on the other hand, comes from abroad and does not have this kind of linked relationship, this is the second point. Speaking only of raw silk and rayon, in terms of consumption, raw silk showed a particularly severe contraction during the transition period of June and July. In contrast, rayon rose, reaching an unprecedentedly good situation during June and July, with the consumption index rising to around 145. Generally speaking, when the price of raw silk exceeds the price of rayon by a certain amount, the consumption area of ​​raw silk is invaded by rayon. According to past experience, this degree is about two and a half times. For example, if the price of rayon is less than US$0.6 per pound, the price of raw silk will be above US$1.5 per pound. Furthermore, the average price of Japanese silk "Special XX Crack" on the New York spot market for ten months was US$1.8 per pound, while Chinese silk "White Filature 21" was also around US$1.7 per pound. This price difference is indeed the only reason for rayon to encroach on raw silk. Leaving aside women's hand-knitted stockings, which are exclusively dominated by raw silk, in terms of fabrics, which account for nearly half of total US consumption, raw silk is now retreating across the board in its competition with rayon, especially in the area of ​​wide fabrics. According to Mr. Inoue's opinion, one reason is that the American people's consumption psychology towards clothing fibers is different from before the panic and that they consider it from an economic perspective. On the other hand, the high and volatile price of raw silk means that changes in fabric raw material costs are immediately reflected in the finished products, making prices unstable. As a result, general fabric manufacturers are showing a relatively hesitant attitude, which is indeed a timely view.</p>
<p>In short, the result of the economic boom in the United States is that silk prices rise along with general prices (here, the relationship between supply and demand must not be forgotten—the decrease in supply passively stimulates silk prices to rise). However, (1) the economic boom in the United States is still on the road to recovery and has not yet reached the normal level, so it inevitably has some shortcomings; (2) on the eve of the second world war, the economic boom has somewhat of a steel smell and lacks a direct influence on raw silk. Therefore, the result of the high price of raw silk is to promote the decline in raw silk consumption. It can be seen that the benefits of the economic boom to raw silk are not the same as to other industries, with an equal proportional distribution of benefits. Although, it cannot be denied that there is a considerable stimulating effect.</p>
<p>5.  Chinese and Japanese Silk in the American Market</p>
<p>After analyzing the impact of American economic conditions on raw silk consumption, we will then discuss the situation of China and Japan, the two major raw silk suppliers for American consumption. Because the two countries have different geographical and personal situations, their supply to American consumption naturally has its own different trends. A review of this issue is one of the main purposes of this article, as it is directly related to China.</p>
<p>In the past, the American raw silk consumption market was exclusively dominated by Japan. In recent years, it has increased from 80% of the total amount to over 90%. The first to be affected by this is naturally Chinese silk. According to statistics, the decline of Chinese silk exports to the United States has retreated from 25% in 1923 to less than 2% in 1934. However, in 1935, judging from the trend after the slight increase in consumption in the United States, Chinese silk and Japanese silk showed a strong struggle. According to a survey by the National Fabric Manufacturers Association of the United States, Japanese exports to the United States increased by only 9.5% in 1935 compared to 1934 (421,006 bales in 1943 and 461,246 bales in 1995), while Chinese silk exports to the United States almost tripled in 1935 compared to 1934 (7,807 bales in 1934 and 22,761 bales in 1935). As for the quantity consumed, Japanese silk increased by only 6.7% (446,004 bales in 1934 and 475,952 bales in 1935), while Chinese silk increased by about 77% (10,316 bales in 1934 and 18,257 bales in 1935). The intensity of the competition can be imagined, and it is also clear why China's silk industry received such good stimulation the year before.</p>
<p>Because the world's raw silk suppliers are mainly China and Japan, there must be an inverse proportional relationship between their raw silk exports. As a result, the consumer competition between Chinese silk and Japanese silk was still very tense last year. According to the survey by the above-mentioned agency, when observing the recent trend of American raw silk imports in the past ten months, with the monthly average number of the previous year as the base, both China and Japan showed a declining trend. However, the degree of decline of Chinese silk was 14 points lower than that of Japan. Japanese silk decreased by an average of 16% compared to the previous year in the past ten months, while Chinese silk had a decline of 30%. However, recently, there has been a gradual tendency to recover. The situation of Chinese silk and Japanese silk exports to the United States in the past ten months is listed below to see the whole picture:</p>
<h3>Compilation Method of Income Tax Return Forms (4)</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>(1) Report Form for Firms (Continued)</p>
<p>(1) Remarks: After filling in all the above items, other items that need to be declared at the same time can be filled in the remarks section. There are about two aspects to these remarks: (1) Public reserve fund and retained earnings, etc. According to the current laws regarding income tax, although they cannot be included in the capital calculation when calculating the income tax rate, many people in the society have requested the Ministry of Finance to broaden the scope of the public reserve fund stipulated in Articles 7 and 15 of the Taxpayer's Guide. In the future, the goal may be achieved. It would not be useless to declare it now. (2) The head office and branch can declare their firms separately, and their business income can be calculated together to pay income tax. According to the provisions of Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, if the capital of the head office and branch are divided, their income should be calculated separately. Article 2 of the Draft Collection Instructions for the First Category of Business Income Tax states that the division of capital between the head office and its branch offices mentioned in Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for Implementation refers to cases where the capital and business of the branch office are completely independent. According to the interpretation of the Ministry of Finance, if the brand name of the branch office is different from that of the head office, and its capital and business are not completely independent, its income will still be calculated together with the head office. In this case, there should be very few cases where the head office and branch office calculate income tax separately. Regardless of whether the brand name is the same or whether the capital is divided, as long as the source of the capital is the same, it can be taxed together. The so-called completely independent business is rarely found in practice. Therefore, when declaring a firm, the name and address of the branch office should be filled in the remarks section so that it can be checked when taxation is consolidated in the future.</p>
<p>(7) Date of Filing: The month and day of filing this form should also be clearly filled in. All the items declared above are the situation at the time of filing. If there are any changes in the future, no matter what kind of matter is changed, a declaration of change must be made. The receiving agency for this form is the local competent collection agency. In Shanghai, it is the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance (on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs Building). When sending it, you can record it in the return receipt book and obtain a receipt for collection. According to the format of this report form, there is no need to affix the firm's seal or prepare a separate letter.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>Special Issue on the National Flower</p>
<h3>Preserved Plum</h3>
<p>— (Xu Yunqiu)</p>
<p>Lyrics of the Mei Lu Lou: In the year of Yichou, He Zizhen and Wu Pingzhai drank in Pan Yangxian's studio and composed a poem on potted plum blossoms, using the original rhyme of Su Dongpo's "Water Melody": A tree, a round moon, another ancient plum heaven, mountain fist curved hunched, flower longevity unknown, also called bamboo fence thatched cottage, also called grand hall golden house, style always high cold, expected to be Miao Gushe, little exiled to the mortal world. Slanting shadow, solitary crane stands, thin dragon sleeps, short screen curved table clear supply, bottles and pots arranged in a circle, carved by Wu Gang's fairy axe, moved next to Zhen Niang's fragrant tomb, experiencing kalpas to get heaven complete, married to Geng An's painting, white sleeves are more charming. Note: Potted plum blossoms in Wuzhong are best planted by Gu Zhong'an. During the Gengshen Rebellion, the gardener moved them to a remote place in Tiger Hill, so they were safe and sound. My friend, the owner of the Ziluolan'an Studio, has the same hobby as Zhong'an, and his collection of fine species even exceeds his; and his elegant gatherings of poetry and wine, and the joy of feasting on flowers, are no less than those of the Pan family in those years. Now, I have selected a dozen of the most precious ones to participate in the Wuzhong Literature Exhibition. I once read Chen Meigong's "Peaceful Chats" saying: Red plum blossoms used to be popular in Suzhou, and Yan Yuanxian transplanted them to his Xigang mansion; one day, a wealthy tourist bribed the gardener and got a branch to graft. From then on, there were two trees in the capital. This can also prove that red plum blossoms originally came from Suzhou. Therefore, Zhou Jun brought these fairies from Luofu Mountain to the grand meeting, which is truly enough to add luster to Wuzhong's literature and make each other more brilliant.</p>
<h3>On Plum Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Tang Dongyuan</p>
<p>Plum, ancient writing as 某, symbolizes the fruit on the tree, later written as 梅, follows 每, a homophone. The Book says, "If you want to make a harmonious soup, you only need plum and salt." If so, it means to mediate various flavors, so calligraphers mistakenly used it as Ganmu, using 梅 for 楳.</p>
<p>Gushan and Yuling are famous in lyrics, and Mei Fei and Mei Xuan are listed in biographies. Lin Bu of the Song Dynasty built a hut on Gushan in West Lake without marrying or having children. He planted many plum trees and raised cranes, using them as his plum wife and crane sons. The ancients called plum blossoms, pine trees, and bamboo the Three Friends of Winter, because they can help people with a clear, noble, and elegant demeanor.</p>
<p>Plum blossoms bloom before the leaves in early spring, with a fragrant aroma, so Jia Sixie said: Plum blossoms are superior in fragrance, peach blossoms are superior in color. I say: No, who doesn't go alone among the Dengwei and Xixi plum blossoms in full bloom, without calling, fragrance and color are both excellent.</p>
<p>Plum, Rosaceae family, deciduous, leaves are broad oval or oval, pointed at the tip, with serrated edges. When young, the tree stretches straight, with many branches and dense flowers, presenting a beautiful appearance; when old, the trunk gradually bends, the heart of the tree decays and becomes hollow, but the outer branches sprout and bloom, increasingly showing an old and elegant appearance.</p>
<p>Fan Shih-hu wrote the Plum Blossom Manual, which contains more than ninety varieties, but recent people claim that there are hundreds of varieties, roughly divided into white plum and red plum, single-petal and double-petal, four categories. Jiangmei, also known as Yemei, Zhijiaomei, is produced in the barren and clear environment of mountains, streams, and waterfronts. The petals are small, grayish-white, the fragrance is rich, and they grow sparsely on the branches. The Japanese Jurui Book says: "Plum blossoms have four virtues: they value sparseness over density, oldness over tenderness, thinness over fatness, and containment over opening." Jiangmei can be said to have all four beauties. Zaomei, also known as Dongzhi Mei, Guangqunfangpu says: "The flowers are better than Zhijiaomei. The spring in Wuzhong is late, and it only begins to bloom in February. Only this variety blooms before the winter solstice, so it is named early. There is also a variety on Qiantang Lake that blooms especially early. I once broke off a new branch on the Double Ninth Festival, with a horizontal branch opening against chrysanthemums." The flowers are single-petaled red, and there are also white ones; there are also Basuomei, which bloom in mid-autumn, light red with many petals, and small and lovely wheels. People cherish those who bear fruit early. In addition, there are Xiaomei, Huangxiangmei, Hedingmei, Huangjinmei, Dongmei, Zimei, Six-petal Mei, Chongyemei, Lüyuemei, Yuanyangmei, etc., all of which are famous. Ancient books also mention Momei, Zhaoshuimei, Pinzimei, Xingmei, and Lizhimei.</p>
<h3>Potted Plum Blossoms Planted in Ziluolan'an Studio</h3>
<h3>Plum House Miscellany</h3>
<p>— (Zhou Shoujuan)</p>
<p>Since our government clearly designated plum blossoms as the national flower, I have become obsessed with plum blossoms. I planted plum blossoms extensively in my residence and built a small house called Plum House, and a small hill called Plum Hill. Those planted in pots and basins are also full of plum blossoms. In early spring, when the flowers bloom, they are charming with violets. I carefully appreciate the color and fragrance from morning to night, and I can treat them as moth eyebrows in the soil, and I don't get close to my house for a month. In the spring of Bingzi, Yi Zijun came from Jingjiang to see my plum blossoms and gave me a poem: Fairy posture and jade bones are beyond the human world, exchanged for a light frown that is tender and cold, red powder new makeup wears embroidered jacket, plum blossom fragrance wrapped in violets. The word "wrapped" is wonderful.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Yuhu settled in Wuxia, and we often visited each other. He was also addicted to plum blossoms. He had twenty pots of plum blossoms in his collection, which were the old objects of Hu Huanzhang, an expert in plum blossoms in Wuzhong. The jagged iron bones are more ancient. A few days ago, I came to his door to admire them and saw a trunk standing upright like a falcon, with a few white flowers blooming on it, naturally picturesque. Before leaving, I received a draft of Xia An's poems as a gift. I washed my hands and read them, and I loved them so much that I couldn't bear to put them down. Among them, there were two quatrains about plum blossoms, which I especially liked, such as "A Small Journey of Immortals": The elixir recipe cloud curtain locks the smoke and haze, the color world of human beings recognizes no difference, I am tired of the fairy traces still disturbing, riding a solitary crane to step on plum blossoms. Night Sitting: A solitary tree in an empty courtyard hides returning crows, the pearl blinds are silent and wet with dew, the twelve cloisters are as clear as water, and the lonely moon guards the plum blossoms deep at night. It seems like the words of someone who does not eat human fireworks.</p>
<p>Green calyx plum blossoms are the best, like lightly made-up beauties standing in the moonlight, with the most secluded charm. I recently got an old green plum tree stump, only a foot or so high, with a dry trunk as thick as a human arm, with more than ten flowers, sparse and picturesque, which is very lovable. Among those who have praised green plum blossoms in the past, I especially love Wu Lanxue's "Sitting in the Moon": The forest pond is secluded like a mountain house, sitting and turning the railing, the moon is not slanting, a pair of fairy cranes are asleep, and the cold fragrance blows all over the green plum blossoms. Shao Xinjiong's "Awkward Spring" says: The awkward spring weather makes it difficult to borrow wine, the slight snow is clear and the sun is easy to slant, tonight the tile stove stops the medicine paste, and my wife teaches me to cook green plum blossoms. Both poems are also clear and beautiful, like green plum blossoms.</p>
<h3>Exploring Plum Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenxiang</p>
<p>Spring comes early in Jiangnan! The spring news brought by red plum blossoms, especially this year's West Lake, has no silver traces of ice and snow; it makes people feel that they have the opportunity to catch up with spring in Jiangnan first.</p>
<p>At Wang Zhuang, a tea merchant's residence on the lake, we saw the trees full of extremely beautiful red plum blossoms as early as a few days before the Beginning of Spring. We remembered a seven-character quatrain "Exploring Plum Blossoms on Dengwei Mountain" by Mr. Wang Jingwei fourteen or fifteen years ago. The original poem says: "The spring mountains outside the forest are broken and connected again, the melting ice in the pond is just trickling, in the secluded places of the farmhouse's broken fences, a tree of red plum blossoms is particularly beautiful." The appreciation displayed in this poem is, after all, superior. He specially focused on "in the secluded places of the farmhouse's broken fences", telling that red plum blossoms have another kind of touching beauty. It seems that ordinary tourists who go sightseeing do not have enough words to describe this feeling. We, with the mood of ordinary people touring the lake, can only feel that the red plum blossoms in Wang Zhuang have a particularly vivid posture, it seems very difficult to say in other places!</p>
<p>In the homes of some friends in Jiangnan, I first saw a few potted red plum bonsai, and I always thought they were artificially forced. It was not until I went to Wang Zhuang to see the red plum blossoms on the lake that I realized that the mildness of the natural air is a natural flower house.</p>
<h3>Japan and Plum Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>The Japanese's favorite is, of course, their national flower, the cherry blossom, but cherry blossoms do not last long, and they wither in less than a week, and they are not suitable for bonsai for the desk, which is the biggest drawback. Plum blossoms not only have branches and trunks in hundreds of forms, but also have many types. The tall ones can be arranged in gardens, and the small ones can be used as bonsai. Everything is more suitable than cherry blossoms. Therefore, the Japanese who like to plant trees are very fond of and cherish my country's national flower, the plum blossom. However, plum blossoms are very expensive in Japan. According to their customs, they must offer the Three Friends of Pine, Bamboo, and Plum on New Year's Day. Ordinary people only put pine and bamboo in front of the door, and they cannot put a pot of plum blossoms on the "tokonoma" in the house.</p>
<p>Japanese single-petal plum blossoms include varieties such as Yuyu, Golden Plum, Snow Cup, Full Moon, and Yuhong. There are more double-petal varieties, including Baiyunlongliannei, Jinmei, Tangmei, Huan Shanbai, Yueying, and Canyue. The red plum blossoms of Kagoshima are darker in color than our Tiegu red, so it is also called Zhenheimei. Japanese plum bonsai are very different from those in our country. Most of the plum bonsai in ordinary flower gardens in our country mainly focus on blooming luxuriantly, and the pruning posture is very vulgar. Although the upright plum bonsai have no artificiality, they lose the beauty of sparse shadows when left to nature. Therefore, in our country, it is really not easy to obtain perfect specimens except for experts who grow them for private appreciation.</p>
<p>Pine and cypress bonsai are famous plants in Japan. They also cultivate plum blossoms in the same way as pine and cypress. In addition to the flower species and flower colors, they also pay great attention to the posture of the branches and trunks, flower pots, and mountain stones. Fortunately, those who grow flowers and trees in Japan are not large flower gardens, but retired soldiers and idle nobles. Therefore, they do not focus on buying and selling, and all kinds of research can be done. The only key to Japanese bonsai is to cultivate a very small tree so that it is like a big tree, plant it in the middle of a flower pot, and appreciate it as if standing under a big tree. The same is true for looking up and down. At the Hibiya Plum Blossom Exhibition, I once saw one named "Hong Shidare," whose branches drooped downward, slender like willows. There is also one named "Miken," whose trunk is unusually withered and empty, shaking and falling, but it has countless flowers, which is clear and unique. There are four trees planted in one pot, each with its own posture, shaped like a plum forest, but the height is less than a foot, and the arrangement is very orderly. The trunks of the plum bonsai are not thick, but the emphasis is on the bending posture. Those with exposed roots are attached with green moss and mountain stones, which have the meaning of ancient Chinese paintings. Among Japanese bonsai, pine and cypress are the most recommended, followed by plum blossoms, and then chrysanthemums and miscellaneous fruit trees.</p>
<p>In winter, cut flowers are also mainly plum blossoms, sometimes set off with camellias, waterside mountains, and pine and bamboo, to maintain them until the cherry blossoms bloom. Japanese women all learn flower arrangement and use scientific methods to make them last longer. When arranging flowers in our country, first burn the cut end with fire, and it can last for a long time if it is placed upright in water. According to the Japanese, the cut end should be slanted to increase the area. After burning with fire, immediately insert it into the water and do not allow air to enter the trunk. Then the water contained in the trunk can be heated by fire to form steam, which rises directly to the top of the trunk to nourish the flowers, so the plum blossoms can last for more than a month.</p>
<h3>Watching Plum Blossoms (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>The giant wheel of time is speeding rapidly on the track of life. It has taken away my childhood and crushed my youth. The impoverished life is cruelly whipping me, forcing me to leave my lovely hometown and my warm home, drifting from this city to that city, and from that city to another city. Many rugged paths in the world have been rushed through so hastily that I have never had the leisure to think about some elegant things. Although I am not ignorant of elegance, or do not love elegance, all the wonderful ideas have long gone with the troubled years of life!</p>
<p>Sometimes, I would occasionally think of some leisurely pleasures, such as: traveling, watching the tide, seeking scenic spots, visiting plum blossoms, etc. Especially visiting plum blossoms. Whenever I think of plum blossoms, I will think of my hometown where the mountains and fields are full of plum forests. Although in childhood, as long as it was the season when plum blossoms were in full bloom, I would almost every day run and jump with my playmates under the cover of the plum forest. There, on the hillsides, in the suburbs, on the branches of many plum trees, all were covered with balls of snow-white plain flowers, shining with silver foil in the sunlight. It set off the maiden-like tranquility and loveliness even more against this dull gray background. However, although I had a good impression of plum blossoms at that time, I did not understand what sparse shadows and slanting slopes meant, or what a faint fragrance meant. It was just that sometimes when I looked down from the mountain peaks, I saw a vast expanse of silver sea, and when I shook the plum trees a few times, I saw countless plum petals falling from the branches like flying snow, and I thought it was very beautiful.</p>
<p>Recently, I have gained some leisure time due to unemployment, so I have been able to come here during the season when plum blossoms are in full bloom to appreciate the snow-white plum blossoms.</p>
<p>However, the weather this spring is really as cold as the depth of winter, so although I chose to come back during the season when plum blossoms are in full bloom, the plum blossoms are still deeply asleep in their dreams. This has given me a disappointment that has struck heavily into the depths of my heart.</p>
<p>For half a month, the weather has always been gloomy, and it has been cold and warm from time to time, so there is no trace of spring in nature. Until recently, the sky has been clear, and the weather has been warm, so a few old plum trees in the corner of the house have been spitting out plum petals. One day, two days, three days... the buds on the branches have all opened, and the plain shadows are jumping outside the glass window. From then on, I seemed to have recovered my childhood and found my youth. Every morning, I would push open the lattice glass window and look outside, like a hungry prisoner standing behind iron bars hoping for freedom and bread, I just watched so greedily.</p>
<h3>Changing Nest Luan Feng</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 11 (Mutterings Arouse Compassionate Parental Concern, Repentance Betrays Filial Piety, Autumn Light Dimly Reflects Jade Complexion, Scene Evokes Literary Sentiment)</p>
<p>Menglan said: It's not, it's not. I have another idea now. Today, I want to decide what kind of person I should be. Either an old person or a new person? I can choose either of these two types, but I shouldn't waver between the new and the old. The Second Young Mistress said: In that case, I don't know, let me ask my younger sister another question. Do you want to be an old person? Or a new person? Menglan held the empty teacup in her hand after finishing her tea, shaking it tightly several times. When she shook it, she seemed to be struggling very hard, as if the teacup could be crushed at any moment. The Second Young Mistress was taken aback and could only stare at her blankly. She bit her lip, thought for a long time, and said to herself: It's hard to be a person! I'll choose the easier one, to be a filial daughter. The Second Young Mistress felt that she couldn't ask any further after talking this far. So she smiled slightly and said: Sister, I am a straightforward person, I just speak frankly and forget taboos, there are many things I shouldn't have told you. After telling you, I regretted it a little. If Mother knows, won't she say I'm gossiping? Menglan said: You can rest assured about this, I will never say you told me. Besides, I have given up all hope and don't want any chance of advancement, even if you told me, it doesn't matter. The Second Young Mistress stood up, tidied her temples, and smiled: I don't care what you plan to do after hearing my words? Anyway, I'm telling the truth. Even if Mother knows, she can't say I'm spreading rumors. I think Mother would have wanted to tell you this a long time ago, but she just couldn't bring herself to say it. As she said this, she was still holding the edge of the table, looking at Menglan. Although she moved forward slightly, she didn't leave. Menglan said: What are you still hesitating about? Is there anything else you should tell me that you haven't said? The Second Young Mistress looked at her with a smile, shook her head twice, and said: There's nothing else to say. As she said this, she walked forward, held Menglan's hand and shook it twice. Only then did she look back at her twice and slowly go downstairs. Of course, Menglan sat in the small building, thought about her sister-in-law's words, and added countless worries. When the Second Sister-in-law was speaking, she didn't feel anything strange. But after she finished speaking, she kept looking at her again and again, as if there was still a sentence she wanted to say but hadn't said. So she first leaned on the table, propped her head and thought. Then she lay down on the bed, hugged the pillow to her side, and closed her eyes to think. Finally, she got up and leaned on the windowsill, looking at the white clouds in the sky. She waited until the clouds in the sky turned red, and flocks of crows flew across the sky, and she saw that the day's time was spent in confusion. (141)</p>
<p>International Women's Day Special Edition</p>
<h3>What We Should Do to Commemorate "March 8th"</h3>
<p>— Jin Guangmei</p>
<p>The annual March 8th International Women's Day has arrived again today.</p>
<p>The significance of the commemoration is for us to review our past work, grasp the current situation, and create a future.</p>
<p>In today's era of serious national crisis, our commemoration of March 8th clearly gives us a special mission. Our nation is a nation that is being oppressed and invaded. Our country is seeking survival in death and striving to save itself. Therefore, our burden is heavier and more difficult than that of women in other countries.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, we women are members who are being advanced in the entire national liberation movement, but we cannot ignore our own strength, which is also sufficient to help the future development of the national liberation movement. We cannot ignore this interactive effect either.</p>
<p>In this torrent of national rejuvenation of uniting to save the country and saving the country through our own efforts, we women should concentrate and cherish all human and financial resources to contribute to the country, which cannot be different from others.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the current stage of national crisis, in commemorating "March 8th", we should take the Three Principles of the People as our common belief, and under the premise that national interests are above all else, strive for our future work and strive for our glorious and splendid future.</p>
<h3>Letter to Women of the Whole Country on March 8th</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaoying</p>
<p>The great and glorious "March 8th" festival has quietly arrived again today!</p>
<p>"March 8th" is the most brilliant page in the history of the women's movement, no, it is the most praiseworthy page in the history of human evolution! How should we pay our joyful respects to this glorious day!</p>
<p>However, in this era of serious national crisis and broken mountains and rivers, our commemoration of this "Women's Liberation Day" makes us feel that the responsibility borne by Chinese women is extremely heavy, — thus the meaning of the commemoration is particularly profound!</p>
<p>The women's movement in China has a history of more than 30 years. Looking back, on the one hand, women have achieved a lot in the process of struggling through various hardships for their own liberation, the evolution of society, and the freedom and equality of the nation, and have fulfilled their due responsibilities. From the "May Fourth" Movement, to the "May Thirtieth" Movement, to the "September 18th" Incident, to the "January 28th" Incident, and up to today, women have always stood on the front line of the anti-imperialist movement, bravely doing the work of saving the country. Objective facts have long provided correct proof, so there is no need to be long-winded here.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, women inevitably have some shortcomings: The most prominent of these is that most women lack the spirit of unity like loose sand. Because of the lack of the spirit of unity, the actual effect obtained for any matter is often not in line with what we ideally hope for. This is such a painful thing. I dare say: If the women's movement in the past had the spirit of iron-like unity, its achievements would have been thousands of times better than today!</p>
<p>Yes, "the past" is like "the dead". How should we remedy our shortcomings in the future? Indeed, there are many ways to remedy this, but I think the work that urgently needs to be done at present is: ——</p>
<p>The first is unity! The second is unity! The third is still unity!</p>
<p>Because only with unity can there be great strength; with great strength, we can resist the enemy's invasion, save the nation's crisis, and establish all great and difficult undertakings and achieve amazing results!</p>
<p>Women of the whole country, on this glorious "March 8th" festival, for the sake of the nation, for the sake of the country, and for the sake of ourselves, let us unite together!</p>
<h3>Review of the Chinese Women's Movement in Recent Years and the Path It Should Take in the Future</h3>
<p>— Jiang Huiruo</p>
<p>Today, March 8th is the anniversary of the International Women's Labor Movement. Looking at the achievements of the labor and women's movements in various countries around the world, and observing the current situation of our country's women's movement, I can't help but feel emotional. Due to space limitations, the world women's movement will not be discussed for the time being, but I will briefly review the decline of our country's women's movement in recent years:</p>
<p>One or two years ago, some people in our country advocated that we should follow the policies of Italy and Germany, and shout "Women should return home" to free up positions for men. For a time, many people echoed this view. Although this policy of quenching thirst with poison can temporarily relieve some unemployed men for a while, it is ultimately not a long-term solution. Why? Because if working women leave their jobs and return home, relying on their fathers and husbands for a living, and if their fathers and husbands have abundant income, then the women will return to their families, living a life of luxury and leisure, enjoying their parasitic life. And the fathers and husbands will exhaust their energy to support their wives and daughters, spending their entire lives as oxen and horses for their wives and daughters. I really feel sorry for these men. This is discussed from the perspective of middle and upper-class families. If it is a middle and lower-class family, the father and husband's hard-earned income will not be enough to support their wives and children. They will inevitably rely on their wives and daughters to go out to work to supplement the family's insufficient income. If they are dismissed from their jobs and return home, although society euphemistically calls it "managing household affairs," even a clever wife cannot cook without rice. In the end, the gentle ones will complain and feel sorry for themselves; the cunning ones will do evil. This kind of situation is obvious to everyone. People with insight have risen up to attack this view, believing that men and women should each work according to their individual characteristics in order to create a happy family and a strong country. Therefore, in the past year, the call for women to return to their families has not been heard again.</p>
<p>Of the 220 million female compatriots in our country, less than one-thousandth can receive education, and within that one-thousandth, with the exception of a small number who have received university education, the rest have only received primary and secondary education. Primary education is national education, so I will not discuss it for the time being. However, if you look around at the secondary education of women in our country, it is all given a general education, preparing them for entering universities. But let me ask, how many secondary school graduates in our country can enter universities? And in general, women who have received secondary education do not have a skill and cannot adapt to society, wasting talents, which is regrettable. Therefore, I say that in the future, the secondary education of women should focus on vocational education, so that women who are generally unable to attend university will not feel incompetent and overwhelmed after entering society. This is the first thing that those engaged in the women's movement should strive to improve.</p>
<p>At present, middle and upper-class women are all carefully calculating their own interests, and are indifferent to the suffering of the majority of working women. In the future, we should strive to assist working women, remove their pain, improve their lives, and provide them with appropriate education, so that those who are aware can awaken those who are not, and those who know can enlighten those who do not, so that working women can get rid of the difficult and oppressive life and ascend to the paradise of equality and freedom. This is the second thing that those engaged in the women's movement should strive to improve in the future.</p>
<p>I hope that people of insight at home and abroad will provide guidance on whether the above opinions are appropriate. I would be very grateful.</p>
<h3>Reflections on March 8th</h3>
<p>— Wu Daiyi</p>
<p>The times are constantly advancing. The annual March 8th International Women's Day has arrived again. This solemn and great international women's festival is a day to commemorate the world women's liberation movement, and it can also be said to be a day of awakening for women around the world. Remembering the efforts of our predecessors, how should we continue to struggle? This is a point that women around the world should pay attention to when commemorating March 8th.</p>
<p>Regarding the historical facts of March 8th, women engaged in the women's movement and women in the intellectual class probably all know about it. I feel that the Chinese women's movement is significantly different from those of other countries, so I will just talk casually about what I have seen and heard, which may be what is needed now!</p>
<p>The times are constantly advancing, and the environments are also different. Dealing with each issue must be adapted to the times and examine the environment. The slogan of the Chinese women's movement is indeed the same as that of other countries, demanding liberation, but China is a country with un-popularized education and very backward production. The feudal forces of society have not been fundamentally eradicated, and the moral intelligence of women themselves is still declining. Foreign troubles and internal worries are pressing each other, and the nation is in danger. Therefore, the greatest goal of the Chinese women's movement, in addition to demanding liberation, should take national revival as a prerequisite. Otherwise, if we do not focus on the root and only focus on the branches, I dare say that there will be no results.</p>
<p>Chinese women have been granted the same equality as men in politics and economics by law, so Chinese women basically do not need to fight for the principle of equality in rights anymore. As for the scope of freedom, under the permission of the law, there is no discrimination against men, but the reality is not always the case, and it is still not truly realized. The reason is that the patriarchal system and feudal poison that have existed for thousands of years have deeply rooted in people's hearts and are not easy to reform in a short time; and the fact that women's education and occupations cannot be widespread is the biggest obstacle to the progress of the women's movement! In this situation, popularizing women's education and promoting women's occupations are indeed urgent and immediate tasks.</p>
<p>In recent years, women in the intellectual class have gradually awakened. The majority of women are still unaware and are content with their inherent dark lives. Not only do they not know anything, but they also think that it should be like this. How pitiful, these ignorant women! Women who are enlightened are responsible for awakening them. I believe that if they do not join our group, the women's movement will never be completely successful. Going deep into the masses is very necessary.</p>
<p>Now that we have understood the direction we should strive for in the future and have actually done it, we must also actively eliminate all obstacles, move forward resolutely and decisively without hesitation, without being complacent, without fearing difficulties, without compromising, and without yielding, so that we can realize our ideals. I would like to offer some superficial views on this glorious day of commemoration.</p>

<h3>Man's Conspiracy Against Me</h3>
<p>— Luo Caiqing</p>
<p>After reading the report in this newspaper "Going to Bailing Temple," I felt as if I were there myself. A soldier said to me: "Soldiers are afraid of dying in vain. This is our only chance. How can we easily let it go?" China has always been known as the nation that loves peace the most and the best market in the world. However, there are still countless brave soldiers who "are willing to use their flesh and blood to fight the enemy and sacrifice for the freedom of the entire nation and people," — not soldiers who "bullets enter from the back."</p>
<p>However, as the author said, "What we find most heartbreaking is that the enemy's war expenses of more than 10 million yuan were all allocated from the smuggling items of the pseudo-organization in eastern Hebei, and the guns, ammunition, and bombing aircraft used were all produced by the Shenyang Arsenal. Taking the money of the Chinese to pay for the war expenses of the Chinese killing each other, and taking the military equipment made by the Chinese to slaughter the Chinese, what a fierce and cruel means this is!" Man's conspiracy against me has reached the extreme. Looking at the three treasures obtained in the recovery of Bailing Temple this time: One is Major General Shima's book "Notes on Military Affairs," which contains special records. The places where military fortresses can be set up and food can be stored are all clearly investigated; the second is a military map of 1/50,000 and a military map of 1/100,000, from the various leagues and banners of northern Chahar to Lanzhou, Gansu and Ningxia, all measured with extraordinary precision; the third is various planning documents for the enemy's invasion of the northwest, which makes people shudder!</p>
<p>They have already planned very carefully for our country, which is "large in area, rich in resources, and rich in products," and the intelligence agencies in various places, such as the Zhengzhou Special Service Agency, are carrying out their "dreams of ambition" overtly or covertly! On the same day (7th), we also read in a certain newspaper a special dispatch from Tokyo, saying that they had completed an international film called "New Land," which tells the story of a couple going to Manchuria to open up their "New Land." There is a song called "New Land" in the film: "People without land! Where are you going? Look, the continent and heaven beyond the sea! There is land waiting for us there."</p>
<p>"Can we let the four northeastern provinces of our country be permanently occupied by others as 'New Land'?"</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Ride That Doesn't Cost Money</h3>
<p>— Laoxin</p>
<p>I was very hungry. As usual, I was quickening my pace to rush home to make my own meal with the gas stove. But when I turned from Avenue Joffre into Route Tenant de St. Julien, I remembered that I hadn't been home for a long time, and there was no food at home. So, where should I go? — Just as this thought came to mind, my pace slowed down. My mind was spinning in confusion, almost as if I wouldn't even notice if I bumped into a wall in front of me. Just as I was regaining my senses, I suddenly heard an unfamiliar, low, anxious, and unnatural call in my ear:</p>
<p>"Sir, rickshaw!"</p>
<p>I'm not used to taking rickshaws, especially when there's no need to take one. Although I felt that it was a bit unusual, I still ignored this very plain sentence and continued walking my own way.</p>
<p>However!</p>
<p>"Thank you," I had to pay attention to what this rickshaw puller, who must be hiding something secret, was saying. "Thank you for taking my rickshaw, — Avenue Albert! Thank you."</p>
<p>Although it was a thank you, it was unnecessary, so even though I had paid attention to this very forceful sentence, I still walked on my own way without caring. And wasn't I still worrying about the problem of eating in my heart: cooking, no; going to a restaurant, that would be too expensive; so, was I really going to just have a bowl of plain noodles, which didn't seem very appealing, …</p>
<p>"Sir, please do a good deed! Sir: Sir…"</p>
<p>This unexpected voice finally woke me up from my chaotic emotions. So, I had to look at this guy who was begging others to take his rickshaw with strange eyes — a rickshaw puller, no different from the thousands and thousands of others seen on the road, with a swarthy face, strong arms, and those strong legs, weren't they just as thick and hairy as ordinary rickshaw pullers, very strong and powerful? Although he was a bit older, he was only in his forties or fifties, definitely not a weakling who had to beg people to take his rickshaw because he couldn't compete with others. …</p>
<p>Before I could finish scrutinizing this strange rickshaw puller, he had already revealed a spark of hope on his wrinkled forehead. His lively eyes were signaling to me, and his hands had also stopped the rickshaw shafts. He was bending his waist, forming a posture for someone to get on the rickshaw. I understood that this must be the trouble I had gotten myself into after I looked at him. However, since I didn't need it, even if it was a kidnapping-like action, I definitely couldn't give in. So, I didn't continue scrutinizing him and walked forward with my head held high, as if nothing had happened. However, this strange stranger didn't let me slip away from his hands. My ears clearly heard him pulling the rickshaw and following me. And he also said —</p>
<p>"Sir! I don't want your money! Thank you…"</p>
<p>My nerves twitched a bit, and my head immediately turned around again. This strange rickshaw puller actually dragged the rickshaw over, crying, and putting on a welcoming posture again. And I, this shameless, greedy person, was immediately stopped by my self-esteem from this desperate act. After hesitating for a moment, I blushed and walked on my own way with my head held high.</p>
<p>"I don't want your money! I don't want your money…"</p>
<p>I was tired, I knew it myself. But, what was going on? How could there be freebies in this society? However, now that this freebie was actually being offered to me, wouldn't it be a deception, or even something more terrible? But, facing this strange thing that was constantly buzzing in my ear, it actually aroused my curiosity.</p>
<p>So, my foot stopped slightly. This strange guy seemed to be afraid that I would really escape from his hands, so he quickly chased after me again. Again, it was a welcoming posture, but his mouth was begging even more pitifully:</p>
<p>"Thank you, I don't want your money! Just drag it across the road, I don't want your money!"</p>
<p>This time, a burst of courage made me sit on it, and he, this pitiful stranger who was asking for trouble, seemed to be dragging the rickshaw very hard to run west. After passing the Route Cardinal Mercier intersection, I realized that there were still quite a few rickshaws stranded on the east side of the road, and they, those poor rickshaw pullers, were all watching my rickshaw with envious eyes. At this time, my heart was mostly relieved, and I slightly speculated on the cleverness of this matter. Later, I simply asked this lucky rickshaw puller, and he answered happily:</p>
<p>"Empty rickshaws are not allowed to be pulled!"</p>
<p>It was the traffic regulations of civilized people again. So, I began to talk to this person who had already become familiar with me.</p>
<p>"If they're not allowed to be pulled, aren't they trapped there?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it so, there will be no business for a lifetime, unless you pass Avenue Joffre, but that's even more unthinkable."</p>
<p>"Then, how do you change shifts?"</p>
<p>"God knows."</p>
<p>"Is there no way to reason?"</p>
<p>"This world doesn't reason! Yesterday, I accidentally had my license confiscated and was fined five jiao, and I dragged the rickshaw for a day for nothing. Who can you reason with!…"</p>
<p>His words were not finished, and the destination had arrived. This strange and short-lived relationship of ours was over. He, like a bird out of a cage, was burning with the light of his hope. (Casual Encounters)</p>
<h3>Exploring Plum Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jingding</p>
<p>During this winter vacation, I went back to Zhejiang. On the train, I met an old friend from Hangzhou. He insisted on dragging me to stay in Hangzhou for one night. Fortunately, I hadn't seen Hangzhou for three years. It would be good to stay one night and play for a day. That night, I stayed at my friend's house. The next morning, I visited a few old friends whom I hadn't seen for a long time. With more people, it was even better to play. So, we decided to go see the plum blossoms (or rather, "search for plum blossoms"). Although it wasn't snowing that day.</p>
<p>We had a full meal at eleven o'clock, and the three of us started from the Banner.</p>
<p>The willow leaves on both sides of the lake embankment had all fallen, leaving only some dead branches swaying there. We walked to the end of the Bojue Bridge on the West Lake. This is the area of Gushan. Walking west along the northern foot of Gushan, the plum blossoms were in full bloom in less than two hundred steps, and a faint fragrance wafted over from time to time. On the roadside, I picked up a white plum blossom that had been discarded from the hands of cruel people. I picked it up and inserted it in my front lapel. What a fragrant smell. I only felt that this white plum blossom was like a chaste little girl, a lucky one who had escaped from the sexual period of bestial people.</p>
<p>Thinking like this, it seemed that we shouldn't have come to explore the plum blossoms. We walked to the tomb of Su Manshu and didn't want to leave for a long time. Looking at the many tourists walking towards Gushan, many plum branches were probably sacrificed in their hands.</p>
<h3>Sai Jinhua (1)</h3>
<p>— Written by Chen He</p>
<p>Due to the inferiority of the social system, and the economic oppression of people, regardless of danger or shame, as long as it is a job that can earn money, they will do everything they can to do it. Jin Yunxian was a woman who only cared about profit: She saw that Sai Jinhua was beautiful, so she tricked Sai into going to various flower boats to play, secretly earning a lot of money. The young and ignorant Sai Jinhua was swallowed up by the dark society from then on!</p>

<h3>Chen Boer Returns</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Chen Boer returned from comforting the troops in Suiyuan. She arrived on the express train from Ping to Shanghai at 7:40 yesterday morning. Only she alone returned this time. It is said that the other members of the troupe had returned earlier. Only Wu Sihong and Cui Wei have not returned. Wu Sihong had some private matters and had to go to Qingdao once. Cui Wei is still in Peiping because she is preparing to participate in the military-civilian memorial service to be held in Suiyuan on March 15.</p>
<p>When they stayed in Peiping, wasn't there a rumor in Shanghai about them being under house arrest? In fact, this rumor is not true. The Peiping authorities hoped they would leave sooner rather than later to avoid causing more trouble! It was they who were unwilling to leave because they had promised the soldiers guarding the territory at the front that after returning to Peiping, they would definitely raise some money by performing plays to buy things to send to them. In order to keep their promise and to fight for freedom of performance, they refused to leave before the play was performed. On the one hand, news and advice obtained directly and indirectly advised them not to perform for the best. Under such circumstances, it was almost deadlocked for a month. Later, on the evening of the 1st of this month, they performed four plays at Yenching University: (1) Descendants of Traitors; (2) Female Reporter; (3) Abandoned Child; (4) Dawn. There were more than 1,000 audience members, and the performance was very successful, so those who sympathized with them had an even better impression of them.</p>
<p>At the front, they performed three plays: "Put Down Your Whip," "Zhangjiadian," and "Smuggling." In addition, there were singing and speeches. All these results were very good. The tears and loud shouts that moved the soldiers were clear evidence. There were only ten of them when they left Shanghai, but because people joined their team along the way, there were a total of thirty-nine people who went to the front. They stayed in Gui Sui for two days, Bailing Temple for two days, and Pingdiquan for one day. Adding the time spent on the road, it took about a week in total. During this week, although they suffered from the cold and suffered some physical hardships, they were quite happy in spirit. They fulfilled a part of their responsibility as citizens, and they who had fulfilled their responsibility were still the so-called weak and "difficult to raise" "women" who were usually looked down upon by adults and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Regarding Chen Boer's future path, because the newspaper had mentioned her resignation to the Star Film Company a few days ago, she was asked about it. She said: "I just came back from Peiping, and I am not very familiar with the situation in Shanghai. As for the resignation, it didn't happen. It's even more impossible to leave the Star Film Company because I have a contract with the Star Film Company."</p>
<p>Finally, let me go back and talk about the people who went to welcome her yesterday morning. Because it came so suddenly, too few people knew about it, and there was no time to notify everyone, so the people who went to the station yesterday morning were, in addition to reporters from various newspapers, only Miss Ji and three others, and then her husband and her child, Ren Ke.</p>
<h3>Strongman Backmen</h3>
<p>Since the Backmen Beauty Contest at the Carlton, all circles have expressed surprise at the strongman Backmen. In addition to being able to move his whole body muscles to any part to dance to the music, Backmen can also use the muscles on his back to hold the car handles on a car weighing 300 pounds and carrying three people on it, pulling it slowly. He can also stand on an octagonal platform, holding a wooden plate with more than a dozen men and women sitting and standing in between, supporting it with his head and hands, and rotating the octagonal platform with electricity, so that the audience can see that there are no traces of borrowing in the front and back. His martial arts are really not easy. In order to understand Backmen's own history, the reporter met him backstage yesterday through the introduction of Mr. Zhou Shengcai, the Chinese manager of the troupe.</p>
<p>Backmen is from Latvia and is 41 years old this year. Before the age of sixteen, he was physically weak and felt pain. He then joined the Lige Sports Association. After a year of hard work, his body became stronger, completely different from before. In that year, he won first place in weightlifting at the association. Three years later, he won the German weightlifting championship. In 1925, he won third place in the world weightlifting championship. His highest record is 306 pounds with both hands and 210 pounds with his right hand, which he can lift three times in a row. His head can withstand more than 1,000 pounds of weight, which is beyond the reach of ordinary people. In addition to the muscle dancing, muscle pulling, and weightlifting performances, his martial arts also include using iron hooks to clamp on the muscles of his back to hang in the air, with three or four people hanging on his feet. He can also play with iron bars as thick as silver coins in his hands like noodles, and he can carry more than twenty people on his left and right shoulders, walking calmly, etc. His martial arts can be seen.</p>
<p>Backmen also clarified to the reporter the situation of muscle pulling. He had seven people stand on the stage for a live test. The reporter also stood among them without any clamping. As for the movement of his muscles, it is actually controlled by a kind of nerve sensation, and it must be combined with both soft gymnastics and mechanical exercise to achieve success over time. As for his head, it can withstand at least 2,000 pounds of weight, so lifting more than a dozen people is not difficult. Backmen then led a tour of his octagonal platform. There is a small door behind this platform, with a plate inside. Backmen stands in it and rises using electricity, but the ascent and descent are very slow, taking more than twenty minutes. Therefore, the performance time cannot be too long.</p>
<p>Backmen is in his mid-century but looks like he is only in his twenties. He is crude, with many mustaches and bald in the middle of his yellow hair, which is actually because he often performs head stunts. He has never married in his life and is still a virgin. He has no feeling for sexual desire. He has an older brother who has passed away. He usually pays attention to muscle training, averaging six hours a day. He stipulates that he must sleep for at least eight hours. When he sleeps, no one is allowed to enter, and the windows are not closed, because he loves outdoor living. He gives up smoking and drinking, eats vegetables, and does not eat meat. Therefore, his method of solidifying essence, circulating energy, and protecting the original yang can reach this level.</p>
<p>Backmen also said: He recently plans to publish an advertisement, offering a reward of 5,000 yuan to anyone in Shanghai who can perform the same martial arts or any part of his martial arts as him, with half of the money going to charity. He hopes that people from all walks of life will come to compete, and he will definitely not go back on his word.</p>
<p>Backmen came to Shanghai with the Haijingbo Circus two years ago, then returned to Germany. Recently, he organized a song and dance troupe in Germany, using his own name as the name of the troupe. He hired famous performers from various countries along the way. The entire group of seventy people came directly to Shanghai from Germany. Since they performed on the 25th of last month, they have been quite popular. Starting tomorrow, they will perform for various groups for free for a few days. There is not much time left. Before leaving, he briefly expressed his elegant intentions. Backmen shook hands with the reporter and gave him several recent photos as a souvenir.</p>
