<p>時評</p>
<h3>開發海南島在國防上的意義</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>自從去年北海事件發生。日本一度派艦前往海南島的海口以後。國人的目光漸漸集中於我國那唯一的大島了。去年十一月間。宋子文親往該島視察。計劃開發。本年一月。粵省建設廳又擬定開發海南島四期計劃。準備分期實施。最近香港華商總會又邀滬粵各界。共同組織海南島實業考察團。前往該島。作周密的考察。準備在將來投資興業。雖然具體計劃的賓施。還有待於長時間的規劃。但國內實業界對於該島關心如此殷切。也是值得稱道的。</p>
<p>海南島正在亞熱帶重要物產應有盡有。鑛產如金•銀•銅•鐵•錫•鉛•鹽•等。蘊藏很富農產如米•甘蔗•橡樹•椰子•咖啡等也有大量的生產而感恩•江昌•崖縣•凌水•萬寗•定安•會樂等縣的森林。更是廣大無垠。又因四面環海。產魚很多。在海南島和非律賓安南之間。有廣達五千四百平方里的漁區。是世界一大漁塲。從經濟的觀點這實在是不能漠視的地方。</p>
<p>不但如此。海南島在國防上也有很重要的意義。南部崖縣的榆林港是一個天然的良好軍港水的深度和形勢的險要都在福建三都澳之上。倘能加以經營。定可成為我國南部海軍的根據地。當此我國北部重要軍港多已淪亡的時候。經營這個軍港以為華南國防的第一線。其意義自很重大。正惟如此。海南鳥也就使强鄰垂涎了。日人石凡藤夫在其所著“從軍事觀察海南島”一文中。說“海南島對於華南尤其對於廣東廣西。是作戰的根據地…海南島的地位。無論如何。對於兩廣軍隊的登陸。以及海上的交通貿易等。都有支配全局之勢。”文中的結論又說。“假如該島的榆林港能够成為一大軍港。而日本可以自由使用的話。挪末日本可以在短時期內。把艦隊集中該港。一舉而使香港的軍事價值失其效力。使西貢的法國艦隊潛伏不敢現。在優勢的美國艦隊未曾到達之前。卽已控制中國的南海於手中了。”</p>
<p>單看這篇文字。就可推想海南島已經成為日本南進政策的目標了。我們為鞏固南部的國防計。為經濟上自力更生計。非趕緊來開發海南島不可。無論要耗費的資力多麼巨大。要遭遇的阻力多麼可怕。這個半荒的大島總是值得我們竭全力來建設的。因為在中國復興的途徑上。這項艱苦的建設是必經的階段啊。</p>
<h3>日本新外相佐藤研究打開難關政策</h3>
<p>擬恢復退出國聯時所失友邦　軍備排除外侮不應用以侵略</p>
<p>（東京）佐藤尚武、因其對內對外政策、尤其關於外交政策之意見、與林首相及杉山陸相等、見解一致、入閣就任外相、而於三日晚出席閣議、闡明其外交根本方針、其內容大致如下、現以日本為中心之東亞情勢、殊不許樂觀、打開此難關之關鍵、實繫於日本對於將來所採行動之是非、故日本外交、應始終在明朗方針之下、立脚於國際正義觀念、實行政策、而當其實行之際、由軍部•外交當局•及政黨•與各省之間、成立密接諒解、而以其集合之力邁進、實行國是、則可於不久將來、打消列國誤解、必能打開難關、且以日德防共協定新得友邦、不難恢復曾以退出國聯所失友邦之交誼、前途廣人、且外交為擁護國家正當發展者、故不應無充分軍備為其背景、但軍備常為排除外侮之力、而不應為實行侵略之軍備、佐藤外相根據於此根本方針、擬擴大從來陸海軍與外務之三相會議、考慮各閣員均得協力實行外交政策之方法、並於適當時期、闡明其抱懷之外交方針、（四日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）佐藤外相三日晚舉行親任式後、在議院內談其抱負謂、余就任外相之結果、或有人以為日本外交有急激變化、然據余意見、國家與國家永久存在、一國外交方針、不應頻繁變更、母寗使一國樹立外交政策、保持幾分繼績性、乃為必要、以此而論、余個人任駐外使臣時之見解、或所抱政策、在今日就任外務首腦人時、能否完全採用、尚待研究、尤由日本政府外交方針繼續性而論、更有再考慮之必要、因此、研究前內閣外交方針後、如有應使保持繼續性者、則依然從其方針、不加變更、但隨從事態之變更、應要改變者、當然充分考慮其改變問題、總之、將與各閣員交換意見後、編製整個政策、努力實行、此余所期望者也、（四日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本駐法大使佐藤尚武返抵東京、僅一晚、卽被任為外相、可見林銧十郎內閣如何追切需要專任外相、佐藤服務於外交界已三十六年、其中三十一年、均遠處外國、而在中國僅於一九一四年任駐哈爾濱領事三年而已、以佐藤在外務省服務時間而論、比廣田尚多一年、四年前出任駐法大使時、曾一度來華旅行、為期僅三星期、因此日本人士多認為佐藤不僅對中國情形無正確之認識、且對其本國實際政情、亦缺乏充分之明瞭、但因彼以外交官資格、長時間駐節歐洲、其觀點與思想不無與長期蟄居東亞一隅者不同、故期望在未來“住藤外交”中、有實際之表現者、頗不乏人、觀於一般情勢、日本今日之外交趨向、决不能完全由外相支配、佐藤之外交方法與程度或可與其他外相略異、但不能有一百八十度之改變、自不待言、誠然、在幕後指揮佐藤的勢力之活動、而非佐藤本人之政策值得吾人主要之注意、昨晚佐藤就任外相後所發表之意見、卽“國家之外交政策、須有連續性”一語、可以證明矣、至於外務省次官人選、須至議會閉幕後方能决定、但如由白鳥敏夫充任、則將來外交之趨向更可明瞭也、（中央社四日電）</p>
<p>（東京）新外相佐藤為刷新外交起見、定於日內實行外務省內及駐外使臣之大批更動、而駐法大使、因秩父宮殿下行將渡歐、尤有早時補任必要、內定起用現駐意大使杉村陽太郎為駐法大使、同時以駐瑞士堀田公使繼任杉村原職、（四日同盟社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）日本駐法大使佐藤尚武已被任為外相、此間觀察家聞之、頗加讚揚、謂佐籐對于歐洲事務、極為熱悉、且曾駐法多年、故其升任外相、足徵日本方面有與法國促進聯繫之傾向、但日本外交政策一般趨勢、不至因此而有重要之變更、則以林內閣登台之後業經申明外交政葉當以仍舊貫故也、惟佐籐就職以後、若能做到下開二事、則英國政府自必大為滿意、一卽去歲英國水兵在台灣基隆港、遭日本當局虐待、因而引起英國方面之抗議、此案延擱數月、迄未解决	、今後希望日本政府能將本案設法解抉、二卽去年三月間英美法三國簽訂倫敦海軍條約之後、日本迄未接受該約所規定之質的限制辦法、故希望日本海軍省能于本月底以前接受此項限制、而簽字加入該約云、（中央社三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）日本駐法大使佐藤尚武、被任為外相、熟悉遠東事件之人士、對於此事、鮮加評論、僅對於佐籐之外交才能、備加讚揚、謂佐籐係日本舊派外交界中最卓越人物之一、且係屬於擁護國聯會之一派、蓋渠曾數次代表日本政府出席國聯會、直至日本退出國聯會時為止、當一九三一年中日滿洲事伴發生之際、佐籐在日內瓦異常微妙之談判中、拆衝罇俎、維護日本利益、功効卓著、其在巴黎、任駐法使節、任務異常困難、蓋近年法俄兩國互相接近、而日俄兩國則關係頗為緊張、佐籐處境、殊難應付、然至佐籐離法為止、法國人士對渠、仍具有廣大之同情、此非佐籐應會之靈敏、不足致此也云、此外一般觀察者、則以佐籐對於國聯會、感情頗佳、且在法國駐節多年、此次出任外長之後、或將改善日法兩國邦交、以致日德用國友誼感受影響、以故頗表不安、此與往歲日本前駐法大使石井男爵昇任外相時、德國一般人之不安心理、如出一轍也，（中央社三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）日本駐法大使佐藤尚武、升任外務大臣之後、小巴黎人報頃加以評論云、“法國官塲對於此舉、極表歡迎、緣佐藤大使乃係法國之摯友、奉使駐法、前後四年、對於法國旣富有同情心、其折衝玷壇之才能、亦有不可及者、其去思自非一時所可湮沒也、”該報縷述佐藤之經歷、調其在歐戰前曾任日本駐俄大使館參事有年、對於俄國情形、極為熟諳、今旣擢任外務大臣、必可利用此種經騐、而有所貢獻云、（中央社四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）日本駐法大使佐藤尚武、任為該國外相、消息傳至此間之後、國聯會人士均熱烈表示歡迎、以為此乃日本之幸、卽全世界和平、亦且蒙其利、佐藤蓋無時不以世界和平為念也、又佐藤耀升外相之後、日本與國際會所屬各技術團體必可賡續合作、例如軍縮會議主席團會議、定於本年五月六日開會、日本自必派員參加云、（中央社四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）參院今日所通過之中立法、係畢特門所提山、今日討論中之特點、為共和黨議員波拉與樊登堡挾擊美國於棄海洋自由主義、又共和黨議員約翰生謂、該議案之通過、不啻會去國會宣戰之權、此為國會最後與最重要之職責云、該法所載各條、在任何時經總統宣佈戰爭狀態之存在後、卽自然發生效力、總統並有權隨意禁止美船運輸足以危及美國和平之住何物料、（中央社二日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）附加修正條文、規定各項物品、凡屬中立法載明禁止運往交戰國者、美國商船若加以裝運、則美國政府卽不予該商船以保護云、（中央社三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）國內最有力之農業團體若干、今日已非正式互相團結、反對修改菲列賓獨立法、以免不利於美國之農民、據悉參加此項運動者、有南部十三州農業委員之代表、彼等在政治上頗有勢力、今日已開始舉行“敎育宣傳”、俾使全國農業領袖、明瞭美國與菲島之關係、最重要者約有下列、</p>
<p>㊀美菲貿易現在美國居入超地位、</p>
<p>㊁菲人頗有多購他國貨物之傾向、</p>
<p>㊂美國對菲如再讓步、則美國士產橡皮植物油及糖之農民、將大受影響、此等團體某發言人稱、獨立法倘有修改、凡屬不利美國農民者、國會當不致通過、農業團體向來擁護獨立法、亦因該法規定於菲島獨立之後、其他位將與其他獨立國相等云、（三日國民電）</p>

<h3>國聯行政院九十六屆會議之觀感</h3>
<p>各重要問題結果圓滿　顧大使備受各國讚揚</p>
<p>日內瓦通訊、國聯行政院第九十六屆會議、業已閉會、自一月二十一日起至二十八日止、計開會六次、這是本年第一次行政院會議、這次的會議、雖經過了相當的困難、但是却有相當的成功、不但是為國聯歷史上一頁光榮的記錄、且可為將來會議的模範、歐洲輿諭稱此次結果為國聯的復興、蓋因此次的各種問題中幾個重要問題、處理得宜、結果圓滿、</p>
<p>第一、土耳其與法國之糾紛</p>
<p>在行政院會議之前、土耳其會堅持由峽克Sandjak之完全獨立、土法之談判、幾成僵局、地中海上濃霧籠罩之中、隱然的又添了一番憂慮、當時傳言有土耳其將用武力解决之說、倘使成為事實、國聯不免又增加了次崩潰的恐怖、但使這兩個會員國、却沒有效法前人的榜樣、也沒有在國聯之外找尋解决的途徑、而將此問題交行政院處理、表現了雙方信任國聯遵守盟約、行政院處理的結果、使雙方都能滿意、且誠意接受、於是一個極嚴重的問題、能够懸崖勒馬、趨於法律化外文化、因之兩國的國交、復歸車軌、實際上雙方的民衆、都得到了無限的好處、這種無限的好處、完全由於信任國聯及遵守盟約而得到的、可以作為將來的榜樣、因為向來國聯處理兩會員國的糾紛若得中國同意、則必遭乙國拒絕、有“遵守盟約的、也必有一個破壞盟約的、中日問題•玻巴糾紛•義阿戰爭問題•雖有不同、國家雖有强弱之分、然而遵守則”也、破壞則也、因有破壞之成例在、故觀察者對於土法問題、事前能不樂觀、事後對於國聯乃抱無限的希望、</p>
<p>第二、但澤問題</p>
<p>自德國退盟以來、但澤問題、亦日趨嚴重、幾成德國波蘭國聯衝突之中心、德國國社黨、在但澤之勢力日益擴張、凡非同情於日耳曼民族者、均有恐怖的威脅、甚至於國聯所委的統治委員萊斯特氏、也遭受過侮辱、所謂在國聯統治下的自由市、已漸漸失其自由、但澤市在歐洲東北部、隱伏着不少的危機、在去年十月、第九十三屆行政院議時、所表演的尤為顯著、但澤議會主席葛萊斯、在行政院會議席上、不是代表市民的口氣、乃代國社黨表示威脅、他曾聲明不再來日內瓦了、所以在第九十四五兩屆行政院會議、但澤問題、竟不能討論、但是葛萊斯又來日內瓦出席了、且出現於九十六屆會議席上、這次的態度很溫和客氣、對於行政院新委的統治委員、他表示同意、並表示願意合作、他聲明與統治委員的關係、完全建樹在法律上、這次的結果、雖然與歐洲過去的幾個月的政治變遷有關係、然而實際上、確實表現了三人委員會的努力、行政院又一次的成功、</p>
<p>第三、智利西班牙關於難民的糾紛</p>
<p>此項問題、事先並未列入議程、乃是智利代表臨時的發動、智利代表要求西班牙政府對於避難於使館之難民、加以保障、因西班牙政府對於逃亡者之慘殺、智利認為違背國際公約、由智利代表與西班牙代表之辯論、且轉為與蘇俄代表之激辯、但行政院終算達到調停的目的、我國顧代表、以主席兼報告員、往來於智西兩國代表之間、不下十數次、更兼艾登•（英）德爾波斯•（法）兩代表協助調停、大家雖費了舌敝唇為的工夫結果、總算是圓滿解决、雙方同意、直接談判、是為本屆最後的集會、該日下午自三時起、行政院忽而秘密會議、忽而公開會議、直至晚八時半、始告閉會、顧代表的報告書、經行政院一致通過、使小題未得大做、也可以說是行政院又一次的成功、雙方代表對於顧代表之調停苦心、亦頗表感謝、</p>
<p>第四、駐國聯報界代表之言論自由問題</p>
<p>駐國聯國際記者公會會員、近年以來、凡有關於反對法西斯主義之論文、常遭瑞士政府之壓迫或驅逐出境、舉世認為民主政治最發達之瑞士、可是因為處在兩大法西斯勢力之間、似乎已不能維持其永久中立的精神、對於兩國之政治犯、也不能盡其法律上保護的責任了、但上述的記者公會、根據一九二六年國聯大會通過之議决案、國聯會員國、有保障責任、蓋國聯甚為瞭解沒有報界的合作、則國聯的工作及其和平宗旨、不能得世界民衆之瞭解、瑞士政府、當時業已接受上項議案、但數年以來、對於反對民主政治的或有礙與其他國家的邦交的言論、未見有干涉的舉動、而獨對於有關德義兩國之言論、橫加取締行政院顧主席、於接到該記者公會的說帖後、曾在秘密會議中、提出討論、行政院各代表、均表示憤懣、且通過接受處理、組織五人委員會（中國英法瑞典波關）研究辦法、以便報告下屆會議、行政院接受處理私人團體與小國政府間之問題、亦為國聯有史以來罕有之事、駐國聯記者及歐洲報界、對於行政院主席及各理事的態度、認為國聯尊重言論自由的表現、足以促起輿論對於國聯更進一步的瞭解與同情、尤可謂本屆行政院成績之一、在這不景氣的環境之中、行政院對於上述的幾個重要問題、件件都已達到圓滿結果、其努力未致於空虛、故得到輿論特別的尊敬、在行政院閉會之日、日內瓦國民日報上說“九十六屆行政院閉會了、國聯從來未有如此的蓬勃氣象、九十六屆是最美滿的一屆、恢復了人們的和平期望、因為各理事能負責任、對於重要問題、能識大體一九三七年之開始、行政院各理事、切實負起責任、使各國民衆對於國聯的和平組織、慶賀得到保證……”談到我顧代表該報說“……九十六屆行政院證明了顧維鈞主席之才能、……其他各報贊揚尤多不勝記述、其稱贊我顧代表之精審老練、不减於稱贊國聯也、”</p>
<p>按我國輪任行政院主席、此為第三次、第一次在一九二二年為顧代表初次任主席、第二次為一九二七年、由我國當時駐法公使陳籙任主席、此次則顧代表第二次任主席、顧氏在十七年前曾為國聯盟約起草委員會的委員可謂為國聯元老之一、乃此間人士、多稱為靑年外交家、蓋由其儀表推測、咸疑為三十許人、殊不知閉會後三日、恰屆其五十誕辰、想顧大使之載譽而歸、必較其友人祝壽精神上尤為愉快也、（中央社一月三十日日內瓦通訊）</p>

<h3>張鈁談豫災奇重</h3>

<p>災區廣闊</p>
<p>新新社記者、昨日曾訪張氏於寓所、叩詢豫省災情、及施振辦法、據談、豫省最近幾年來、災祲頻仍、農村經濟之枯竭、人民困苦顚連、情况本已難言、詎知去歲春季以後、暘雨失時、復遭蟲雹、田禾盡桔、竟至顆粒無收、以致赤地千地、流亡相續、災區達九十三縣、占全省十分之九、災民遠九百餘萬、災情最重者、為豫南潢川等三十餘縣、災區之廣、災情之慘、實為罕有、</p>
<p>流亡載道</p>
<p>中央及各慈善團體、雖先後撥募急振欵項、一百餘萬元、及省府發帑、辦理平糶、貸欵貸穀、因災情嚴重、災民衆多、已感杯水車薪、無濟於事、故一般少壯災民、流徙於湖北•山東•河北•及蘇浙等省、老弱者大都覓食無從、流為餓殍、情形實慘不忍覩、最近接省府來電、邇來成千成萬之災民、均已紛紛轉赴省垣一帶、乞求救濟、</p>
<p>來滬募振</p>
<p>本人此次隨商主席（震）晋京、出席三中全會、特向中央請求救濟、業經中央派賑務會委員長朱慶瀾、前往調查、此次來滬、曾分訪杜月笙•王一亭•屈文六•諸先生、接洽勸募賑欵、亦已得諸先生贊助、向各界勸募、惟為賑濟積極計、擬將施行鑿井開渠及修路工賑、故日內並擬訪宋子文先生、陳商一切、並望全國同胞、慷慨解囊、予以救濟、俾拯豫省九百萬災民之生命、於溝壑云、</p>
<h3>黃旭初昨日南返</h3>

<p>駐粵綏靖主任余漢謀、虎門要塞司令陳策、粵建廳長劉維熾等、候乘大來公司麥金蘭總統輪返粵、原定昨晚卽可登輪、於今晨啟程離滬、乃該輪中途遇霧、一再誤時、尚須延至今晨、方可航行抵滬、今日下午五時四十五分、駛往香港、故余氏等亦須順延至今日下午、始克成行、屆時吳市長等各方、均將赴輪次歡送、</p>
<h3>麵粉廠原料恐慌</h3>
<p>存底不及五萬包　訂購洋麥或减車</p>
<p>大公社云、我國去年春熟、小麥產量、較歷年增收百分之三十左右、致麥價在登塲出新之際、一時低跌、日商乘我價廉、卽在華大量收買後、因國麥存底减少、曾於去年九十月間、粉麥市塲、發生空前飛漲、當時因內地屯積、故實際盈虛若何、尚乏精密統計、自今春以來、內地屯積之貨、逐漸被麺粉廠收買、存底已微薄、僅就本埠而論、各廠及雜糧行所存現貨、不足五萬包、照各廠磨粉原料需用計算、不滿二個月之用途、</p>
<p>訂購洋麥</p>
<p>各廠所磨製之粉、因筋綫關係、以國麥洋麥摻雜並用、國麥綫條柔軟、故成數較多、現各廠因國麥存數有限、且收買困難、所有去年秋底所訂之貨、已於年底分批運華交貨外、今春原料更感不敷、特再訂購洋麥一萬八千噸、其第一批八千噸、已運裝抵滬、其尚在陸續啟運、於本月二十日前後方可抵滬交貨、惟此項洋麥市價、每百斤（司馬秤）較國麥高昂三四角云、因原料急需其餘所受損失、當亦不可計及也、</p>
<p>各廠减車</p>
<p>各麺粉廠在此原料恐慌聲中、為維持營業起見、均紛紛减少車數、計開車數不過六七成、倘至四五月靑黃不接之時、勢將引成全部停車、本年播種之麥、詎因天氣失和、麥種深受影響、據熟諗農事方面之推測、本年國麥產量、恐將减損云云、</p>

<p>津滬埠際足球賽、已定本月二十六日耶穌復活節在上海舉行、津隊定二十二日離津南下、預計二十四日可抵上海、在滬比賽三塲、二十九日離滬北返、上海西人足球會已凖備一切、歡迎津隊、兹錄比賽秩序等如下、</p>
<p>比賽秩序</p>
<p>三月二十六日（星期五）　天津對上海　埠際賽　逸園</p>
<p>三月二十七日（星期六）　天津對中華　友誼賽　申園</p>
<p>三月二十九日（星期一）　天津對軍聯　友誼賽　逸園</p>
<p>如二十六日天雨或成和局、則比賽秩序或將變更、</p>
<p>不再試賽</p>
<p>關於上海隊之人選問題、聞上海西人足球會、爲節省時間起見、將不再舉行試賽、將以赴港之代表隊爲參考、稍加變動、勞逸爾球員、决不參加埠際隊、將代表軍聯出席云、</p>
<p>三賽形勢</p>
<p>津滬埠際賽、已賽五次、津勝三、滬勝一、一次和局、爲一九三四年在滬舉行時、各得三球和局、適港隊在滬、遂舉行三角賽、此次三塲比賽、津隊對上海之戰、上海隊乘勝港歸來、對津隊必有惡戰、中華隊雖南遊成績不佳、在本地則孫錦順李義臣賈幼良諸人、一齊效力、局面必將大變也、對勞逸爾、津隊亦未可樂觀、勞逸爾近曾以六比一大勝平漢路、而平漢則曾以三比三和北寗、加以勞隊在滬、近來聲勢甚大、好將亦多、不可輕視、</p>
<p>津隊預選</p>
<p>中央社天津四日電　津滬埠際足球賽、即將在滬舉行、津萬國足球會、將選拔各隊優秀份子十五人、組織成軍將於二十二日由津赴滬、現並定七日舉行二次選拔賽、决定正式代表、</p>

<p>本月重出四十元關　　棉紗前市開盤、因美棉三品紗花市况繼續狂騰、人心激昂、兼之上日跌風未免太暴、於是浮空鑒於環境轉變、急乎扒補、因此反動更劇、漲風愈熾、惟現銷仍淸、故市面帶平尚穩、然本月份已有狂漲之象、抬至二百四十元收盤、實以三品紗飛漲八·八元之譜標紗各月比上日收盤價均漲二元七角至三元半、惟本月獨漲五元一角、午後開盤本月份氣勢大變、市塲多説上午印商多頭公司買進爲額達一萬多包、於是散户空頭紛紛抵補、金子帮上日巨量賣出、昨則復來補空、檯面更覺乾枯、穿四十元外、遠月牽入佳境、但買者减少、二盤後本月獨挺、遠月平平、結果本月比上午收盤價再漲一元半、遠月漲跌二·三角、錦昌長豐晨買午賣、查賣出恒益三千四百包、裕大三千七百五十包、合興三千八百五十包、昶記一千五百五十包、仁豐五千五百五十包、義成一千三百五十包、潤康一千六百五十包、恊成二千六百包、生源二千四百包、永大四千二百包、信誠二千一百包、買進大豐一千七百五十包、通記一千○五十包、錦昌二千七百包、賡豐四千一百包、望泰興三千三百五十包、頥大一千八百包、大昌成六千九百五十包、益昶二千四百包、元一四千一百五十包、福康一千包、</p>

<p>遠月出四十四元關</p>
<p>棉市大漲、氣勢緊俏、因美棉繼續前進、現貨廹近一角四分關口、印棉亦高、大阪三品花漲二元外、於是人心牽動、空方紛起扒補、同時紗市轉趨高翔、漲勢愈形鋭利、遠期兩個月均漲出四十四元關外云、</p>
<p>標花漲起七角半</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月一律飛漲、因美印棉價續升、大阪一品花近遠期均漲一元至一元至一元九角、於是市塲人心震撼、散户抵補、但多數心里因國內存棉尚厚、仍無意做多、標花結果、各月比上日收盤價均漲五六角、午後開盤、市情頗挺、被紗市提起、空頭抵補尤急、市塲議論對於英棉仍看好、結果各月比上午收盤價再漲五分至二角、查賣出信誠三千担、元一二千八百担、裕康三千二百担、合興五千一百担、昶記二千二百担、長餘二千担、大昌成五千担、恒昌三千二百担、大昶二千五百担、長和四千八百担、同和二千四百担、永昌一千三百担、潤康一千八百担、買進通記一萬一千六百担、恒益七千二百擔、裕大四千八百擔、明德五千二百担、瑞大二千四百担、申大三千五百擔、益昶二千二百担、源興昌五千一百担、一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>麥市趨勢由穩轉昂</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、大致平穩、上落甚微、因洋麥互有上落、而市塲之賣買、一部分又以粉市爲轉移、故近遠期初則微好、旋則遠期因天時而微落、迨至下午開盤、初則見定、後以粉市回振、花紗市塲、又反振甚烈、致各月份喊價、亦漸提高較好三五分不等、現麥市面、因到貨不多、廠胃亦寂、聞祇開黄橋麥四百餘包、價與前日相仿云、</p>
<p>期粉至午後亦一變</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、呈初跌繼漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小一二角、坎拿大近小四分遠小一二角、利物浦獨漲二便士零、當開價後、以洋麥互有出入、市氣初尚平穩、旋以天色晴朗、業外多頭、紛紛暢脱、致三四月份、走勢甚鬆、最低又至四元一關、較前日跌二三分、七八月份、賣買較淸、祇小一分零、迨至下午開盤、市氣突轉挺健、以花紗漲風奇速、又有國際借欵之謡、浮空一補、廠方又趁勢拉進、故近期反漲一分左右、七八月份因近期之回漲、亦帶好一二分、此後情形、如國外無特殊變化、當看盤旋之象云、</p>
<p>黄豆芝蔴漲跌不同</p>
<p>近日洋莊芝蔴、有一蹶不振之勢、實以去路静寂、人心毫無生氣、市價跌進十四元大關、尚無人問津、所以大局仍難捉摸、現貨毛蔴幸有日商零星動辦、市價得以立定、黄豆則續漲三四分、去路在豆餅旺銷之下、（昨由汕頭厦門內地等成交各廠餅三萬六千片）廠胃得以蟬聯、且本街內地仍勁、大連亦一復升、故市氣顯見穩固、昨統市計開漢口乍豆四千餘包、四平街豆三車、頴州豆二車、臨淮關豆一車、其他各豆亦有六七百包交易云、</p>

<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源三十餘號、貨共六千石、本街銷塲依舊呆木、船户甩價後、則稍較動動、包胃西安青島帮祗辦薄稻七八百包、故市况下垂、厚粳價削去角半、薄稻跌一角至角外不一、杜尖貶近角、陰兀降角許、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來閘船户念七八艘、市上各貨交易、因天時轉暖、胃納更見淸淡、市形長疲短俏之勢、昨市頂白粳價平疲、中下之貨價少數分至一角、早稻跟小七八分、薄稻亦小五六分、羊埠尖價小近角、杜尖客尖疲三五分、陰變元價較前市又小數分、其餘各貨價均見疲勢、</p>

<h3>杜思妥益夫斯基的普式庚演説詞</h3>
<p>— 陳漢年</p>
<p>最近在報章雜誌上看到不少名流學者的：紀念詩人普式庚的演説，和文字，使我不禁聯想到杜思妥益夫斯基的普式庚演説詞。杜氏的這篇演説是俄國文壇上一件有歷史價值的文獻，發表於一八八零年六月六日莫斯科的普式庚紀念的開幕典禮的一天，這個典禮是由俄國文藝友人會所主辦，被邀參加的作家很多，杜氏和屠格湼夫是其中之最著名兩個。</p>
<p>那個典禮一連繼續了好幾天，第一天晚上是普式庚詩選朗誦，接着是兩天的宴會和演説。七日，是屠格湼夫演説的日子。屠氏在當時一般人的心目中仍然是個最有聲望的作家。他用着他高貴的，有修養的，温和的態度讚美着普式庚的天才，特别是俄國性的天才。他説他是祖國的詩人，是祖國至高無上的詩人。但是他在末尾發出了兩個問題：普式庚是屬於歐洲嗎？這個偉大的俄國人是有世界性嗎？</p>
<p>八日，是臨着杜思妥益夫斯基演説了。他的演説稿是幾天前早就預備好的，所以當他預備的時候，决計没有想到屠格湼夫的文學觀點，杜氏與屠氏在思想上，一個是斯拉夫主義，一個是西方主義，因思想的不同，而仇視很深。但是，事有凑巧，他的演説和屠格湼夫共鳴的地方很多，而且無意中回答了屠格湼夫的問題。</p>
<p>「從來不曾有過一個詩人像普式庚這樣有世界性，」杜氏説，「他不但有世界性，而且這種世界性是這樣非常的深邃，他能够在也的靈魂裏擁抱，吸收外國的精神；就是因爲這種天賦，普式庚的力量得以表現。什麽是俄國民族精神的力量，如果牠不是一個趨向世界精神的抱負，這種世界精神會擁抱整個地球和整個人類？因爲普式庚吐出了民族的力量，他早就預料並且預言了牠未來的意義。因此他是一個先知。彼得大帝的革興對於我們有什麽意義？這些革興不僅是採用歐洲的衣服，習慣，教育，科學而已。人們採用了那些東西就希圖世界的聯合和博愛。没有敵視，只有友誼和親愛，我們把一切外國的天才收入我們的精神，並且能够直覺地，迅速地辨别，去除矛盾，調解分歧；藉此我們表示了我們的凖備和願望，我們，剛剛自己團結好了的我們，希望造成一個全宇宙的團結。俄國人種的意義，無疑地是歐洲的，世界的。要做一個真正的俄國人和做整個的俄國人，其意義祗在此：是一個全人類的兄弟，具有世界的人性。這就叫做斯拉夫主義；……我老早相信，我們——也許不是我們，而是俄國人未來的後代——我們每一個人，都會知道要做一個真正的俄國人必需有這樣的意義；想出一個解决的方法，終止歐洲的糾紛；指給歐洲一條在俄國靈魂裏的避免她的慘痛的道路；替他注入一種四海之內，皆兄弟也的骨肉的親愛，也許在最後，宣佈出世界大同這偉大，極終的消息，照耶穌的福音説，就是全人類友愛的，永遠的和諧。」</p>
<p>杜氏在這一節演説詞裏，不啻是替斯拉夫主義發出了一個宣言，不過他的這個斯拉夫主義决非一般狹隘的愛國主義（Chauvinsm）可比，牠裏面是包含了一個崇高的理想：國際主義。</p>
<p>聽衆給這篇演説所激發起來的熱烈的情緒真是空前的，幾乎是不可思議的。他一上台，一陣長時間的掌聲簡直使他無法開始發言。他終於發言了，可是每一節，每一段落，總受着掌聲不斷的阻撓。他興奮有力地説着，到最後他説到人類博愛的時候，整個禮堂像是發了瘋似的。聽衆們愉悦的叫喊實在難以形容；他們哭着，抱着，並且罰誓要互相親愛。太太們，政府裏的官員，學生們，一齊擁到他跟前，抱着他，吻着他。有兩個老人走來對他説：「我們做了二十年的仇敵；但是我們剛剛和好了——經過你。你是我們的聖人，我們的先知。」接着是全堂的哄呌：先知！先知！他的敵人屠格湼夫也跑了來，緊緊的抱着他，眼裏含着眼淚説：「你是一個天才，勝過一個天才。」詩人阿克賽可夫（Aksakov）跳到講台上，大聲的告訴聽衆，説他的演説不祗是一篇演説，而是一件歷史上的事件。學生們擁來了。有一個學生，淚流滿面，歇氏迭里地倒在他的脚下，昏蹶過去。俄國文藝友人會立刻選了他做名譽會員。又是，一陣瘋狂的歡呼。依照節目，下去應該是阿克賽可夫演説，可是阿氏願意棄權，他説，「我們的天才杜思妥益夫斯基已經説完一切，解决了一切。」這時杜氏很疲倦，想退出休息，可是聽衆不讓他離開。他們預備了一個巨大的桂樹花圏，在會席終了的時候，由一百多個婦女跳上講台，在全體聽衆面前把牠戴在他的頭上。「我們代表全俄的婦女，對於她們，你説得太好了。」誰都淌出眼淚來。熱烈的歡呼又響徹了整個體堂。</p>
<p>詩人普式庚是個謳歌解放，自由的預言者，如今真正的解放，自由是在他的祖國實現了。小説家杜思妥益夫斯基在他的普式庚演説詞裏也是一個預言者，他預言着世界大同，全人類的博愛；可是如今世界上却充滿了火藥氣，屠夫們正在無恥地挑撥着民族的仇恨。俄國的人民憑着他們幾十年來堅苦卓絶的奮鬥，終於在詩人百年祭的今日，享受了詩人的預言。那麽，今日的世界人民一定會以同樣堅苦卓絶的奮鬥，來實現這小説家的預言——這實現的日子，也許同樣在這預言者的百年未到之前就會來臨吧。</p>

<p>一種是「起絶早」。就是在第一天就約好，第二天剛魚肚白，就上山坡去聚會。當天空泛魚白色，天上掛着幾顆疏落的星，山林静穆的躺着，金沙江似乎還未曾睡醒的時候，姑娘很早的就在講好的地方等着，看見男的來了，就拉開了嗓子唱：</p>
<p>「我説是嘍，扁擔挑水兩頭掛，莫玩笑，對你説，那邊有情掛那邊。」</p>
<p>男的聽見了，就會接着唱：</p>
<p>「我説是嘍，妹子！阿哥死也死在花樹下，莫玩笑，對你説，埋也埋在花樹根。」</p>
<p>兩個人坐在森林裏，聽着淸晨的鳥唱，聞着野花的幽香，説着情話，直到太陽昇高了，山中人影凌亂的時候，才踅回家。</p>
<p>在回家的時候，姑娘會望着男子的背影唱個省調！</p>
<p>「刀切蕹㖠格菜兩頭空，兩人做㖠格事兩人知，燕子銜泥嘴要穩，蜘蛛牽㖠格絲在肚中。」</p>
<p>一種是「瓜子開」就是他們和她們的約會，在約會上，一面談話，一面嗑瓜子的意思。「瓜子開」多半是在山上森林裏。姑娘們背着些水果，蜜餞，餅子，瓜子之類的東西，到山上，用羊皮墊着屁股，姑娘約得幾個女伴，團團的圍坐着，談些本子，唱些省調，達里調，門化調，本地調，坐了一兩個鐘頭，才踅回家。</p>
<p>一到過節，中秋或端午，姑娘便大加準備，送男的禮物，送餅子，水菓，蜜餞，鞋子（姑娘親手縫的），帽子……男的也受之無愧，因爲兩龍的經濟權，多半操在女的手裏，姑娘們多半有「私方」，經濟能力很充足，所以送得起許多東西給男子，男子有時還禮，有時則不還，俗呌做「搶」。</p>
<p>雨龍因爲從小男女雙方就訂了婚，由戀愛而結婚是很少的。有時青年男女對於婚期太不滿意，會雙雙的跳金沙江或自掛在山上的林子裏死去，但大多數，則低頭順從，嫁了父母訂好的丈夫之後，養了小孩，在遇着從前的情人的時候，不過互相微笑而已。</p>
<h3>固安道中的夜</h3>
<p>— 王時風</p>
<p>黑暗像天邊的海潮，</p>
<p>淹没了白茫茫的前途，</p>
<p>七星座嵌在高空，</p>
<p>依稀辨得是溝是道。</p>
<p>沉暗的平野上，</p>
<p>顛拐着十幾個青年，</p>
<p>踏着頭前的人影，</p>
<p>脚在鬆泛的土中上下。</p>
<p>下錯了一脚，</p>
<p>摔磕了半身土，</p>
<p>默默地爬起，</p>
<p>不撢一下又動着脚。</p>
<p>「往右邊拐。」</p>
<p>「前面的請走慢些，」</p>
<p>「小心，是個坑。」</p>
<p>「留神，有溝。」</p>
<p>是什麽串起了</p>
<p>這一羣不熟識的人的親暱？</p>
<p>「休養休養吧，」</p>
<p>零落的坐在土中。</p>
<p>「起來——同學們！</p>
<p>沙—沙—又在出發」</p>
<p>樹像在面前站起，</p>
<p>又到了一村。</p>
<p>一星星的燈火，</p>
<p>歆動着無邊親切的喜悦。</p>
<p>驚起了的犬吠，</p>
<p>引出了詫異的眼光：</p>
<p>十幾個少年男女，</p>
<p>摸着黑在匆匆前走。</p>
<p>「到固安還有幾里地？」</p>
<p>「還有十里地。」</p>
<p>快完了，這黑暗的路程！</p>
<p>閃爍着手電，</p>
<p>曠野中聽到了人聲。</p>
<p>「那兒來的？」</p>
<p>「北平。」</p>
<p>「辛苦了！只有五里地。」</p>
<p>素樸的哨兵的慰問，</p>
<p>不遠了，我們已走到了營地。</p>
<p>滋長起脚下的興奮。</p>
<p>「累麽？」</p>
<p>「不。你呢？」</p>
<p>「我也不累。」</p>
<p>是什麽鑄成這些青年的崛强，</p>
<p>在無邊的黑暗里，</p>
<p>深厚的泥土中掙扎着？</p>
<p>小小院落，塞滿了先到的同伴們，</p>
<p>泛濫着洪水的歌聲。</p>
<p>蒼白的煤氣燈，</p>
<p>照着從黑暗里奔波來的一羣，</p>
<p>親熱的</p>
<p>笑着，</p>
<p>訴説着，</p>
<p>互相撲打着</p>
<p>變成黄褐色的毛髮鞋襪。</p>
<p>在歡欣的空氣中，</p>
<p>缷去了渾身的沉重。</p>

<h3>又是戲劇</h3>
<p>— 稜麏</p>
<p>偶然想起戲劇，寫了幾句廢話，不料却碰上一九三七的戲劇年了。既然無意中趁了熱閙，多説少説都一樣，素性又是戲劇。</p>
<p>戲劇年剛開始，就有人担心會閙劇本荒。這兜頭的冷水太無情了，雖實際的情形，却又似也指示有這種可能，不久前曾有某某兩劇團爭排某一劇本，現在就又有某劇團要排某劇本，劇作家不答應，而答應給另一劇團演，并替他們導演。但這都究與實際的劇本荒無關。後一種辦法，倒正可以免除第一種爭執。這自然將引起不爲劇作所支持的劇團的更大的劇本荒，但那已不是劇本荒的問題，而是一個劇團如何會没劇作者支持的問題。因爲上演權的素來不被重視，所以才有人敢於冒昧組織劇團，預備遇什麽可演的劇本拖來就演。這主要的支持既是仰仗着隨便，則别方面的支持，更覺可以隨便，結果，雖有良好的劇本，因其他條件，本不足以支持一個劇團，演出也是失敗。若上演劇本，須顧慮劇作者的支持，則組織劇團時，先須顧慮到能得劇作者支持的條件的完全，則失敗機會却少，而劇作者當無不願意支持他的。自然，假定具備完全條件的劇團太多，而劇作家大少，不够分配時，仍然是會有劇本荒的，但我們現在不能説有預備下這假定的必要。比之演員，我們的劇作者似不算少。</p>
<p>劇作家太多，無處上演他們的劇本，也會無選擇地去支持任何一個劇團。其中固然也有根本只求演出，不顧結果如何的，這些自可以完全置之不論，有些却完全誤於把劇本的能力，和劇作者的能力估計得太高。由演員出身或兼會演劇的劇作者，雖可以是最好的劇作者，但也往往是最壞的。倘若他的演藝才能只是平常的，那末他所寫的劇本，也是不須更高的技能演出的。我們的話劇運動，所還未造就成過一個能得特高的評價的演員，劇作者中却特多演過劇的作者，這也是一些劇作者所以對劇團無選擇的原因。也許我們可以看到一些劇作者連合起來，表演他們自己寫作的戲劇，若預想那樣也未必演得出好戲，因未免想得太落空，那個劇團都不會是個穩固的劇團。</p>
<p>自從提倡業餘戲劇，以挽救文明戲的墮落以來，非業餘的劇團就幾乎没有。其初很諱言職業的演劇，現在職業與非職業是不成問題了，倘有個業餘劇團被要求着繼續出演，則縱是業餘也得職業化。據説現在觀衆及劇院經理，都有這要求，我們希望最先被要求的一個，能成爲穩固的一個。要一個穩固的劇團，才能得劇作者的支持，已如上説，而一個劇團到他的演技能决定劇作的成敗的時候，他的對作家的支持，也許比作家的支持他更大。劇本因演出不行而失敗，是最寃柱的失敗，能把已寫過的劇本，重作一其次公平的估價，縱是對中國的戲劇的最大的貢獻，也就是對作者的最大帮助。我們固難希望一個劇團實地這樣做，可却非有具有這樣能力的劇團不可。而這種能力的保證，似乎借演世界名劇爲表現，不失爲一比較可用的方法。</p>
<p>既然爲劇團本身，有許多戲劇是該演的，爲對戲劇的貢獻，有許多戲劇是該演的，我們離劇本荒至少有一不近的距離，不能與文明戲時代，中外劇本都缺乏的情形相提並論。説怕劇本荒的是預爲他向舊戲找材料辯護，也許嫌太羅織，但我仍得提説縱劇本荒，也不能求助改良舊戲，以致再度墜落。</p>
<h3>白薇的「悲劇生涯」</h3>
<p>— 楚陽</p>
<p>眼前這個「悲劇的時代」没有終結以前，人生總是「悲劇的」吧？先哲曾經説過人類的歷史就是一部「鬥爭史」，也可以説是一部「悲劇史」啊！人爲什麽喜歡觀看悲劇？自古希臘以至於現代，偉大的文學作品無不是悲劇的，難道悲劇是人生的根性，人類的命運？我們從「文學不過是生活的反映」這個觀點來追究悲劇藝術的根源及其存在的社會價值就很容易地發現悲劇所表現的是人生的真實。</p>
<p>凡是居於現實的没落社會的人們，不管它是覺醒的或是夢夢的，又誰能逃得了這個歷史的大悲劇？在歷史的大悲劇之下的個人，它的生活現實無不是悲劇的。</p>
<p>假若我這樣的看法不被人視爲是「悲觀哲學」而能被承認是理性的觀察的話，那我就覺得白薇女士用了「悲劇生涯」四字作她的「自傳」的題名是極有意義和興味的。讀者大概都不會忘記她是一個戲劇作家，一個熱情的女詩人；因爲她深深地理解悲劇藝術，她自己又從家庭，社會和情愛中經騐了實際人生的悲劇，那她用了自己的生命寫下的一部活生生的生活史而題名爲「悲劇生涯」，這豈是輕易按上的！</p>
<p>「悲劇生涯」，或者説它是一部「自傳體的小説」，或者説是一部「小説式的自傳」；但在我讀了之後，我認爲這不是小説，也不是自傳。這是一個和封建的男權的醜惡社會奮勇鬥爭的女子的生活紀錄，這是一個愛自由求解放的熱情的新女性的懺悔錄。我以極大的感動和虔誠讀白薇的此書，如像我讀虚騷的那部尤滿着人性的呼喊的大膽的震驚了世界文壇的「懺悔錄」一樣耽醉。</p>
<p>我並不欲替作者誇大什麽，最好還是聽作者自己的解釋吧，作者説：「世間不一定偉人底生活才值得傳記。渺小的人，也許有他更多的真實，因爲人愈渺小，愈不必有許多虚僞的面具，並且能更多地接觸社會的黑暗和殘酷，甚至更能使他强烈地體騐人生，要求光明和真實。但殘酷的社會能給他甚麽，會剝削他甚麽之間，得覺出更多更多的真實味來。</p>
<p>「這篇東西，是寫一個從封建勢力脱走後的「挪拉」，她的想向上，想衝出一切的重圍，想爭取自己和大衆的解放，自由：不幸她又是陷到甚麽世界，被殘酷的魔手是怎樣毁了她一切，而她還在苦難中掙扎，度着深深地想前進的長長的悲慘生活。</p>
<p>「是用速寫，用素描，用大刀闊斧，真實的，純情的，熱烈的，赤裸裸毫不加掩飾地紀錄下來的可歌可泣的「人生」。是比暴風雨中的梨花更悲的事實，是地獄裏苦痛的靈魂的呼聲，是繪畫，也是詩，是思想不同的青年男女底風流賬，也是時代的産兒的兩性解剖圖，是典型的個性淸楚的輪廓，也是工作和愛情深刻的矛盾，是整個半殖民地的動盪，和殖民地化的民族性的淡寫，也是一個想前進的純真情熱的女子底紅情懺悔錄。」</p>
<p>一部書，如果你不去讀過，任你怎樣的介紹也是無用的，純情的傳奇性質的書尤其這樣。因此，我也不想在這篇短文裏瑣碎叙述它的內容。「悲劇生涯」的內容，簡單地説是十載的苦情貫穿着一個逃脱了舊的牢城（家庭）又淪落在新的苦海（社會）裏的女子的生命，掙扎，掙扎，最後還是掙扎！—恐怕永久也是掙扎吧？假若這條社會的航船不能達到光明的彼岸的時候之前—。因爲畸形的戀愛像一條毒蛇一樣緊緊地纒繞着悲劇的主人公的一身，故此書也完全以那曲折糾紛的戀愛作了全書的中心綫索。在你初讀的時候你設想不到爲什麽一塲戀愛有如許之多藤葛，在你讀完之後你也會要驚奇這戀愛的人生大悲劇竟如此的複雜與豐富，真叫一些單純而又天真的少男少女們要深刻地感到這樣的戀愛的「可怖」：那豈不是青春毒素嗎？社會的健壯的生命是何等可寳貴的啊！要真真地了解此書，那需要具有一個健全的世界觀和人生觀，而且還必須一個更重要的正確的兩性觀和戀愛觀，這不是教你陶醉的書，而是引你批判的書。讀者！你會不惜以你的純潔的眼淚同情於悲劇的主人公，同情於此書的作者，但社會是殘酷的，事實是殘酷的，作者並没有企圖用他那早已流成了一個深潭跳下去她就可以永被淹没的眼淚來換取你脆弱得可憐的神經質的眼淚，作者爲了表達她的人生的真實，亦即社會的真實，她是已經超於事實的殘酷而比事實更殘酷的表現了真實的。因之此書不獨是一部富於熱情的著作，而且也是一部保有理性的著作。</p>
<p>然而，一個會批判的人，或是一個善同情的人，他不一定能覺察出此書的好處。甚或有些對愛情有「淸潔癖」的青年，或瞧不起寫浪漫的愛情的題材要從這書的讀者，他甚至於今對此書對作者起反感。發現好處，先應把握如次的幾點：第一必須理解書中所寫的主人公—亦即作者自己—是一個典型的熱情女子。她若扮演起沙士比亞的悲劇來的確會是一位大導演理想中的Ophelia，她的熱情可以和歌德書中存何一個熱情的女角相比擬。不幸她生在現代，生在東方的中國新舊潮流交替的時期；她雖逃出了古老家庭，逃脱了　賣婚姻，逃掉了封建的禮教，甚至於逃到了脱離這一些舊的覊絆的異邦去了，她度過勞動的生活，也度過自由的生活，當她解！放自己的時候，她却迷失在那個五色繽紛瀰漫着Romantic的戀愛裏了，她終結做了「神聖愛情」的犧牲品，十年也不能自拔！進而就應該知道我們的主人公所處的時代，她完全是五四的浪漫主義—這裏不止是指「文學」的意義而是指由思想到生活的一般來説的—所胎生的人物，那時是唯美唯情的戀愛至上主義發狂一樣流行於新青年與新女性之間的時期，那時他們充滿着浪漫的幻想，而以戀愛爲人生的第一義。主人公熱情的性格與這種思潮相結合就造成了她今後的生命。雖然她的生命不是不變的，她正也隨着時代前進而前進，她也曾投入大革命的漩渦，也曾參加一九三○年前後的社會運動與文化運動；但早就製就的那條生命的紐帶，始終束縛着她，她輾轉於那愛情的毒病中九死一生，最後還是「下落不明」，僅留一綫「光明」的希望！還有一點，我們不能撇開圍繞在主人公周圍的那許多人物與事物來孤立地觀察，爲什麽我們的主人公的愛人是那樣的人物？那位「紅」女士又在串演些什麽戲？痴情的醫生和K先生，她的許多朋友，那些雖然描寫得不詳的社會生活與活動，怎樣生構成主人公的全部悲劇生涯，我們不能不從主人公的環境去洞察她的生活，她的思想，她的情感，她的可敬和可恥處。我們要從個人的悲劇，來研究這個悲劇的社會性：因爲個人的悲劇就是社會的悲劇所造成的啊。</p>
<p>作者如果能將她自身的悲劇的社會性作更鮮明地表露，則此書的息義將更大；可惜她的寫法的着重點，放在戀愛的描寫上，反複層疊地寫來，有的地方會嫌不經濟，使讀者感覺懨膩，她的生活遍歷自五四，一九二五—二七，九一八，一二八等民族歷史上多來多變的時期，她如果能將這些重大的時代背景作爲她生活的後幕，以她自己作主角做中心而更多地織入她的生活紀錄的話，那將何等增加全書的光輝？但她畢竟這樣寫成了，我們祇好原諒她是在「黑雲慘壓得不能透氣的時候」寫的。</p>
<p>我連連地讀下去的當頭，廹我心弦的是作者熱情澎湃，排山倒海似地力量的文字風格，記得作者發表她的長篇小説「炸彈與征馬」時，魯迅先生曾對她獨特的作風加以讚美，她的描寫的確是她自己所説的「粗」的（有許多地方表現非常「大膽」，但她的「粗」却不妨碍她的文筆之美。雖然也有許多描寫過於抽象化及多用抽象字眼，是可疵議的，但這得别論了。</p>
<p>這書也是没有什麽「結搆」的，完全是她自己的「心裁」，全書五篇，長長短短，並非密接地組合，各可獨立成章，全靠她那種熱情澎湃的氣勢纔把它們流滙成長江大河的。</p>
<p>最後，我驚奇，作者在七八年的長期的沉疴之下，生命力還能如此剛强，抱着重病，忍着巨痛，在「書不成而身先死」的恐怖裏，在斷續的幾個月之內竟完成了這部三十萬字的創作，真是一部「死呢？生？」的悲歌了。希望她不要再唱這「自我的悲歌」了，用她今後的生命，替垂死的中國民族，死裏求生的民衆，受着層層壓廹的婦女，去寫一部更偉大的「悲劇生涯」，她自己在這偉大的「悲劇生涯」中開始她的「光明史」！</p>
<h3>一個新聞記者</h3>
<p>— 勞燕</p>
<p>十五年前的印象</p>
<p>前幾天我遇見名記者黄寄萍君。他曾告訴我一段故事。他説這件事至今還不能使他忘記。以下就是黄君告訴我的話。</p>
<p>黄君説：『約莫十五年前。我的父親患貧血症。身體衰弱得很。想服些補藥。一時竟找不到適當的東西。我的母親爲此廢寢忘餐。憂慮萬分。恰巧見到報上「人造自來血」的廣告。據醫生説。可以試服。我便函購一打。服了兩月。居然氣血較旺。深信「自來血」確是補血的妙品。連續服了一年。父親的氣體。已恢復了康健。我們一家人都很感激五洲藥房創製新藥的功德。事情雖然過了十五年。但是我腦子裏的印象。却至今不曾磨滅呢。』</p>

<h3>食菌與烹孩</h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>在報上剛看到能夠吞食各種病菌的怪人之後，現在又看到了想醫治麻病而烹食孩屍的新聞，套句老調，呌做“天下之大，無奇不有”。</p>
<p>吞食病菌的司徒其，到南京碰壁而回，到上海來也只有幾張報紙為之“特寫”一番而已；而且衛生署稱他患有神經病。那怪人到底能不能食菌，只好不了了之，成為“懸案”。</p>
<p>做了“人”，都是想“長命百歲”的。孩子生下地來，先要排八字，看有沒有“關煞”，否則，瞎子先生就先做筆好賣買，呌做“解星宿”。好像一“解”之後，準是長命”如果小生命眞是活得不耐煩而半途死去，那是“命運”了，非人力可以挽回的。</p>
<p>因為怕“死”，人最怕是生病，所謂“好漢最怕病來磨，卽使是“好漢，”一遇到生病，似乎也磨不住的樣子。而現在科學又進步得太快，許許多多生了耳朵，從來沒有聽見過的病菌，被那些“傻子”關在實騐室裏發明了：而這許多新的病菌又沒有尅服的藥劑，如肺病，直到現在，德日兩國最著名的醫生，還沒有發明可以直接殺結核菌的藥劑。而肺病又徧那樣普遍地發展着。記得有一家小學校，檢驗學生的結果，是患肺病者估十分四．三，那些小生命，大概又是“命運不佳”，將被結絯菌結果的，因之司徒其先生“發明”能食病菌，這眞是天上掉下來的救星！他的體力能否抵抗，他自己似乎很有把握，他能繼續十五天不食，（司徒其對某報記者談話看來已經是“奇人”了。可惜的是沒有人請他公開表演，反落得一個“神經病”他自己正害着一種可怕的病呢。</p>
<p>這種不怕死的官傅，倒底落了空。我想除了這位司徒其先生之外，恐怕無法再找出一個確眞的證據，證明人類是不怕死的。其實“怕死”也並不是“罪惡”，做了皇帝尚且要求“不死之藥”，小癟三為了搶飯而打開頭，也是為的要活命。然而因為要“活命”，而烹食起小孩來，總不免有些鮮血淋淋，何况食了死孩，是否可以醫治痲瘋還是個大問題。</p>
<p>然而這世界上，因為自己要“活命”而“殺人一又是很多，而且殺起來總是整百整千，彷彿這世界上有“人滿之患”似的，這樣對比起來，彭池潭骨二人似乎還情有可原，况且殺的還是個“孩屍”。</p>
<p>這個世界眞不知要殺到什麼時候為止，那些“獎勵生殖”出來的小生命，我也頗懷疑他的“命運”眞像犯了些什麼關煞”似的。</p>
<h3>潛行艇氷下往探北極的計劃</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>美國探險家休白特威金斯爵士目下正在組織出海底往探北極的壯圖，倫敦人士現極注意這件事。威氏曾定造海底潛行艇一艘，本定今春出發，至於能否成行，須視這潛艇能否及時造成而定，或者還須展緩－年，也未可知。據現情觀之，所需的引擎，和潛艇所需的鋼料，恐在四個月內不能交貨，但是承造的工廠，目下正在加工趕造，待一切齊全後，只須兩個半月，便能把潛艇造成。</p>
<p>假使威氏决定本年出發，他須在五月一日前試驗潛艇，然後在七月一日左右，由斯關資堡琴動身，向北極進發，以免錯過北極探險最佳的時期。再者，最近三個月內，一切物價，至少已漲高百分之三十五，往時他每次探險所豫備的經費，必比實用之數多籌百分之五十餘，這次的探險費，計算須需二萬鎊，數已很大，假使物價再增高的話，萬一一時籌不着所增的費用，他所視為應立卽實行的要關，怕要延至來年了。</p>
<p>據威氏說：“這是我歷來計畫探險工作中最安全的一次。人們以為我們要被冰困住，那是不明瞭北極的狀祝。這次危險的成分，遠不及一九三一年我們乘了十三年的美國老潛艇“舡魚”號前往南極探險的那次。普通潛艇跟我現在所定造的潛艇，大不相同。我願意得一條好船，以便能夠讓交別人，進行所定的工作·我意中的潛艇，論利便，是絕大的，論舒服，怕是絕小的。它沉沒在水底的時候，重二百十噸，長度是七十四呎，橫度是十四呎，並且有一根二呎寬的方龍骨。艇身是用厚一吋之八分之七的精鋼造成，那是堅不可破的，沉水的深度，不滿五十呎。一切力求簡單，因為這艇實際不過是－個空殼，其中只裝引擎，發電機，推動馬達各一具，和大儲備電池一具。甲板上毫無裝修，房間中亦無特別裝修，和附屬用品，所有的全是科學設備。艇中亦不備沒水舵和潛望鏡，輔助機器是完全沒有的。我們在水面時，可運用無綫電，每天約運用十二小時，沒在水中時，我們能用大電力，跟六百哩外接觸·我們離斯關資堡琴時，平均每日駛行五十哩，直到白棱海為止。我打算留駐北極數天，然後向愛爾斯米亞地進發，以便决定裴里和麥克米蘭二人所信為看見的土地是否存在，那士地柯克博士還曾攝過影哩。那一區域，前後有三次航空探險家前往探視，都未成功。由飛機察勘這區，實在危險得很，因為該處的冰，跟南極的冰全不相同，倘若降在冰面，那冰很容易破裂。水面船隻却不能駛至這區數百哩以內，只有潛艇，還可駛到。用潛艇探險，不如一般人所意料的困難。我們將在冰的下面駛行，隨時能在浮冰的中間露出水面，我們能瞭遠五十碼之遙。我們在那裏並不覺冷，那冰無論好壞，只有十四五呎厚，北極旅行家還說冰的平均厚度，只在一二呎之間·我覺得用尋常的方法，兩個月才可到達，若用潛艇，只須兩星期左右。我們在沿途很多工作，如紀錄海的深度，研究水的成分，考察動植物，測量吸力，這些事在科學世界上巳日見重要。磁性的觀察，也是重要的一項。總而言之，我們將從事前曾行過的各種極地調查，和其他數種調查。我們將在更大安舒和便利狀况下實行這許多工作。至於艇中的人員，我們一共將有七個人，我現在還未選定，但是不難得之，因為來函自請參加的，已有四千多人。須知我們的潛艇，不像普通潛艇的複雜，所以駕駛并不煩難。再加只須照管兩個艙口，而一切佈置，又很簡單，因此力上的勞作，用着極少。不過我們的工作，當然是連接不斷的，在冰下或水下時，我們的推進行動，每日將以十二小時為限。人們談到這件事，都覺得很危險，他們却忘了北極附近有很廣的水面，北極在某時期中，也是如此。就我上次在“舡魚”號所得的經騐而論，我敢說這次組織的探險，可算得我歷來所從事的最安全的一次。”</p>
<p>威氏對於目前所遇的困難，很抱樂觀，希望不日能决定在今年或明年可以出發。但無論如何，這件事必須要做成的。威氏誠懇地說道：這件事我蓄志已久，自從哲斯特主教約翰威金斯氏首先提出這個問題後，到如今巳延緩了三百八十七年，我旣見到，不能不幹它一下。”</p>
<h3>向何處去</h3>

<h3>幸運兒</h3>
<p>— 鴻福</p>
<p>小寶是劉家的獨生子，因為他家資富有，生下來就受着父母的慣養，衣服飲食都是特別考究，並且整日間食糖菓不離口。但是小寶的養育雖然是這樣的優渥，他的發育却不大健全，他今年已經四歲，而容黃瘦！牙齒常痛！時時引起他父母的掛慮。</p>
<p>吳家的孩子—小毛，他家要不過是中產之家，他也沒有過那優渥的生話；但他的發育却是非常快速，非常健全。他今年還不滿兩歲，他却能走許多的路，並且能咬得動堅硬的食物，一般人看見他那樣強健可愛，都叫他是幸運的兒童。其實這也沒有別的，不過是因為小毛的父母，從去年起就給小毛常吃“家樂鈣”巧克力糖，這種糖裏面含有滋補的成分，所以能獲得這樣的效果啊。</p>
<p>兒童常食五洲藥房的“家樂鈣”，就能做強健幸運的兒童。</p>

<p>“狗皮換萞，箕換錢！”</p>
<p>那販子拉長了尾音喊着，他有一個挺拔的高身子，頭上套了隻四塊瓦的貓皮冬帽，蘆葦尖子似的茸毛上，浮了好多細小的白點點，身上，是件肥昂昂地毛藍粗布袍子，下身兩條長腿，鵝樣的望前一探一探地走，不一陣他換了條小巷，從墻角下，一頭狗鑽到他身邊來，嗅了他一回，驚嚇的仰起頭，像受了打似的吠呌狗，皮販子没有理牠，在一家老住宅的大披檐下停了，壁上一個窗户被推開了，一個老婦人俯身岀來，鋭聲的喊着：</p>
<p>“噲，買狗皮的！”</p>
<p>於是，那販子向黑暗中，四面張望了一下，嘴里説：</p>
<p>“誰家呀？”</p>
<p>那瘦小的老婦人，招呼他到自家門口，扭轉身打窗裏面送岀張大花斑狗的皮來。他接過來用手掌輕微地撫摸着，一片小栽絨似的毛斜着去閃岀曲綫的光來，用手划拉着，軟棉棉地感到滑得可</p>

<p>愛，過後把那黑白相間的皮毛，擦了下自己的腮，便伸長胳膊提起來，歪了個臉子仔細地看着，才問：</p>
<p>「兩個箆箕？」</p>
<p>「兩個萞箕加兩吊錢！」</p>
<p>「那太貴！」</p>
<p>「養了四年的個大花斑狗，正月裏壞野崽子們，偷我們後門曬的棗干子吃，我們花子跑上去就咬了個孩子的腿，第二天起早兎崽子們丢給了牠個燒熟滿菁，上去一口，狗就打滾嚎起來，夜晚裏滿嘴狗牙全掉了，我兒子這才剝了牠，這皮上了硝，包管不走油，你摸摸呀……」</p>
<p>「好，給你加一吊，」</p>
<p>瘦老女人接了錢，捧了兩隻柳條萞箕，回過身便把那黑色的門板閉了。</p>
<p>狗皮販子愛惜地把狗皮掛在扁擔前頭，仰起臉看看那黑雲飛滿了的夜空，又要降雪了，他沿着凍了汚泥的小路，又那麽一聲聲地喚呌着：</p>
<p>「狗皮換萞箕喲！」</p>
<p>每一家的窗口都亮起了昏沉的燈光，狗悲凉的呌着，夜把鄉村染上了凝静的黑色。</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui Arrives in Beijing to Meet with Central Authorities</h3>
<p>Will Go to the Ministry on Monday to Take Office. No Changes to Internal Staff. Foreign Policy Remains Consistent.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The new Foreign Minister, Wang Chonghui, along with secretaries Feng Zhizheng and Zhu Yongshou, arrived in Beijing at 7 AM on the 4th. They disembarked at Hepingmen Station. Wang's former subordinates and friends in Beijing were all at the station to welcome him. He then returned to his private residence in the new residential area to rest. Around 9 AM, he visited former Minister Zhang to meet and discuss the handover date. Next, he visited Sun Ke at the Mausoleum and then visited President Chiang at the Military Academy to request instructions on everything. Chiang kept Wang for lunch at his residence, and they had a detailed discussion. In the afternoon, Wang received visitors at his residence. In the evening, he visited Chairman Lin's residence to see and request instructions from the Chairman. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Wang at his private residence. According to the interview, after arriving in Beijing, he had already visited Chairman Lin and President Chiang to request instructions and visited former Minister Zhang for discussions. It was decided that he would go to the ministry on Monday to take office. He hopes that there will be no changes to the staff within the ministry. Those who voluntarily resign will also be persuaded to stay after he takes office. The future foreign policy will continue to follow the central government's established policies and the principles repeatedly declared by the central authorities since the Fifth National Congress. Before taking office, he has no personal opinions to express. His nasal disease is mild in the spring, only slightly more severe in the winter and summer. He has now had his left tooth extracted, and the pus has been removed. He plans to purchase a nasal irrigation device to treat it at home to avoid frequent trips to Shanghai. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the news of Wang Chonghui's succession as Foreign Minister spread, admirers and friends of Wang from the international community have sent congratulatory telegrams. More than ten telegrams have been received from judges of the International Court of Justice and ambassadors from various countries. Mrs. Wang is currently in Shanghai and will be coming to Beijing soon. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) News of Dr. Wang Chonghui, former judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, being appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese National Government, has aroused great interest among experts in Far Eastern affairs here. This is because, in their minds, Dr. Wang Chonghui is one of the most famous figures representing the new China. Commentators believe that Wang is a scholar of achievement in modern times and a first-class jurist, extremely proficient in both English and German. People from various European countries, especially those from the International Court of Justice at The Hague, admire him deeply. As for whether China's foreign policy will change after he takes office as Foreign Minister, commentators here have not expressed their opinions. However, they believe that the new China's foreign policy under the Kuomintang is flexible and that it can handle the delicate diplomacy with Japan with ease and achieve remarkable results. Dr. Wang Chonghui is a senior member of the Kuomintang and a follower of Sun Yat-sen. It can be asserted that he will surely inherit the old ways and carry them forward. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Visits Chairman Wang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen visited Chairman Wang's private residence at 4 PM on the 4th. The visit lasted for forty minutes. The British Ambassador's visit was of a friendly nature. During the conversation, both sides expressed their satisfaction with the increasingly close relationship between China and Britain. The British Ambassador also informed Chairman Wang that he plans to travel to various parts of southern China in the near future to inspect the situation of British expatriates. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) "Le Temps" published an article by the renowned Far Eastern affairs reporter Duboisque, commenting on the speech delivered by Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Council of the Chinese Kuomintang, at the Central Memorial Week on January 18 after returning to China. It stated, "China has now entered a new era, which is a confirmed fact." In Wang's speech, there was a section mentioning the Chinese Communist Party's intention to cooperate with the central government to resist foreign aggression. Duboisque expressed doubt about the sincerity of the Communist Party and specifically pointed this out in his article. He believed that "When the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang was held in Nanjing last month, it passed a resolution to eradicate the Communist scourge and advocated continuing President Chiang's policy of suppressing the Communists. This view is the same as Wang Jingwei's. Some people in China believe that the Kuomintang today should restore the teachings of President Sun and implement the policy of alliance with Russia and tolerance of the Communists. This is a misunderstanding of President Sun's original intention. When President Sun was alive, although he deeply admired the Soviet revolutionary leader Lenin and once experimented with the policy of workers and peasants in Guangdong Province, Sun and his associates never imagined that China's fate should be closely linked with Russia." Duboisque went on to mention Wang's speech regarding Japan, saying, "Wang's views are the same as the hopes of most politicians in China, hoping to resist foreign aggression but only after restoring domestic order... On the Japanese side, since General Hayashi came out to form a cabinet, there is a tendency to adopt a policy of coordination with China. After the selection of the new Japanese Foreign Minister, this trend will surely be further enhanced." (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Concurrently Serves as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei Visits Zhang to Urge Him to Take Up the New Position. Colleagues at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hold a Tea Party to Bid Farewell.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhengting, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Central Political Council, has been appointed as the Ambassador to the United States and will soon take office. At the meeting of the Central Political Council on the 3rd, upon the proposal of Chairman Wang and President Chiang, Secretary-General Zhang Qun was appointed to concurrently serve as the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The resolution was passed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Wang of the Central Political Council visited Foreign Minister Zhang Qun at 11 AM on the 4th to discuss the situation of the Central Political Council, hoping that he would take up the position of Secretary-General immediately. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The entire staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and their families held a grand tea party in the auditorium of the Ministry at 5 PM on the afternoon of the 4th to bid farewell to Minister Zhang and his wife. First, they took a photo in the rear square of the Ministry, and then entered the auditorium for the tea party. Deputy Chairman Chen Lu of the Treaty Committee delivered a speech on behalf of everyone, recounting Minister Zhang's achievements over the past year. Zhang then gave a reply, elaborating on the significance of adjusting the organizational structure, and finally encouraging his colleagues to work hard to serve the country. His attitude was amiable, and his words were sincere. Afterwards, Mrs. Zhang gave a brief speech. The party ended with joy at around 6 PM. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>Japan Eagerly Seeks to Encircle Land in Fengtai</h3>
<p>(Tianjin)</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the Japanese military unit in Fengtai purchasing land to build barracks and an airfield, it is planned to require 1,500 mu of land. Because the Ministry of the Army has already issued the land price, the military unit must purchase it properly to report back. Previously, due to our refusal, they are now instigating Chinese traitors to buy and sell in their names. When the transaction is completed, the contract and payment are made at their unit headquarters. The Wanping Commissioner's Office once sent detectives to monitor the activities of general Chinese traitors. On the 3rd, the Japanese side even raised questions, accusing them of hindering the safety and freedom of Japanese and Korean residents and demanding an immediate halt. For this reason, Mu Ping Commissioner Wang Lengwen came to Tianjin to visit Song Qin to report and request instructions on how to deal with it. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>

However, the Japanese side has not yet provided a satisfactory reply to the Tianjin Customs' requests for compensation, a written apology, and a guarantee that such incidents will not happen again. French Consul General Li Bili, stationed in Tianjin, expressed his apology to Tax Commissioner Mayville on the 4th because the Tianjin Customs was unable to provide adequate protection in the French Concession, resulting in the robbery by Ronin. He also said that he had increased the number of detectives to strengthen the protection of the customs and warehouses to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

Many provinces and cities have implemented it in accordance with the prohibition orders and policies, but there are also many that have not implemented it effectively or are acting on their own. This is due to a lack of firm belief in the anti-opium policy and a lack of enthusiasm for saving the country. The deadline for elimination is very close. If efforts are not intensified, opium addiction will continue to spread and the reputation of the country will be greatly affected.

<h3>The Significance of Developing Hainan Island in National Defense</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Since the Beihai Incident occurred last year, when Japan once sent warships to Haikou on Hainan Island, the eyes of the Chinese people have gradually focused on our country's only large island. In November of last year, Song Ziwen personally inspected the island and planned its development. In January of this year, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction formulated a four-phase plan for the development of Hainan Island, preparing to implement it in stages. Recently, the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce invited various sectors from Shanghai and Guangdong to jointly form a Hainan Island Industrial Inspection Group to conduct a thorough inspection of the island, preparing to invest in industries in the future. Although the implementation of concrete plans still requires a long-term planning process, the domestic industrial sector's keen interest in the island is commendable.</p>
<p>Hainan Island is located in the subtropics, and it has all kinds of important products. Mineral resources such as gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, and salt are abundant. Agricultural products such as rice, sugarcane, rubber trees, coconuts, and coffee are also produced in large quantities. The forests of Ganen, Jiangchang, Yaxian, Lingshui, Wanning, Ding'an, Huile, and other counties are vast and boundless. Furthermore, due to being surrounded by the sea, there are many fish. Between Hainan Island and the Philippines and Annam, there is a fishing area of 5,400 square miles, which is one of the world's major fishing grounds. From an economic point of view, this is indeed a place that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Not only that, Hainan Island also has a very important significance in national defense. Yulin Port in Yaxian in the south is a natural and excellent naval port. The depth of the water and the perilousness of the terrain are both above Sandu Ao in Fujian. If it can be managed properly, it will certainly become a base for our country's southern navy. At a time when many important military ports in northern China have already fallen, the significance of managing this military port as the first line of national defense in South China is very great. Precisely because of this, Hainan Island has also become coveted by strong neighbors. The Japanese, Ishihara, in his book "Observing Hainan Island from a Military Perspective," said, "Hainan Island is a base of operations for South China, especially for Guangdong and Guangxi... The position of Hainan Island, in any case, has a dominant effect on the landing of troops in Guangdong and Guangxi, as well as on maritime traffic and trade." The conclusion of the article also says, "If Yulin Port on the island can become a major military port that Japan can freely use, then Japan can concentrate its fleet in the port in a short period of time and render Hong Kong's military value ineffective in one fell swoop, causing the French fleet in Saigon to lie dormant and dare not appear. Before the arrival of the superior American fleet, it will have already controlled the South China Sea in its hands."</p>
<p>Just looking at this article, one can imagine that Hainan Island has already become a target of Japan's southward policy. For the sake of consolidating our southern national defense, for the sake of economic self-reliance, we must hurry up and develop Hainan Island. No matter how huge the capital to be spent and how terrible the resistance to be encountered, this semi-barren island is always worth our full efforts to build. Because on the path of China's rejuvenation, this arduous construction is an essential stage.</p>
<h3>New Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Studies Policies to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>Plans to Restore Friendships Lost When Withdrawing from the League of Nations; Military Preparations to Repel Foreign Aggression Should Not Be Used for Aggression</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Sato Naotake, because his opinions on domestic and foreign policies, especially regarding foreign policy, are consistent with those of Prime Minister Hayashi and Army Minister Sugiyama, took office as Foreign Minister and clarified his fundamental foreign policy at the cabinet meeting on the evening of the 3rd. The contents are roughly as follows: The current situation in East Asia, centered on Japan, is not optimistic. The key to overcoming this difficulty lies in the right or wrong of Japan's future actions. Therefore, Japanese diplomacy should always implement policies under a clear direction, based on the concept of international justice. When implementing them, a close understanding should be established between the military, diplomatic authorities, political parties, and various ministries, and they should advance with their collective strength and implement national policies. Then, in the near future, it will be possible to dispel the misunderstandings of various countries, and it will inevitably be possible to overcome difficulties. Moreover, with the Japan-Germany Anti-Communist Agreement, it is not difficult to restore the friendship of the allies lost by withdrawing from the League of Nations. The future is broad. Furthermore, diplomacy is for protecting the legitimate development of the country, so it should not be without sufficient military preparations as its background, but military preparations are always the power to repel foreign aggression and should not be military preparations for implementing aggression. Based on this fundamental policy, Foreign Minister Sato plans to expand the existing trilateral conference of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry, consider ways for all cabinet members to cooperate in implementing foreign policy, and clarify his foreign policy aspirations at an appropriate time. (Allied Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After holding his inaugural ceremony on the evening of the 3rd, Foreign Minister Sato spoke about his ambitions in the Diet, saying, "As a result of my appointment as Foreign Minister, some people may think that there will be drastic changes in Japanese diplomacy. However, in my opinion, countries and countries exist permanently. The diplomatic policy of a country should not be changed frequently. It is necessary for a country to establish a diplomatic policy and maintain some continuity. In this regard, my personal views or policies when I was an ambassador stationed abroad, whether they can be fully adopted when I take office as the head of foreign affairs today, remain to be studied. Especially in terms of the continuity of the Japanese government's foreign policy, there is a need for further consideration. Therefore, after studying the foreign policy of the previous cabinet, if there are any that should be maintained in continuity, they will still follow that policy without change. However, as things change, those that need to be changed will of course be fully considered. In short, I will exchange views with the cabinet members, formulate an overall policy, and strive to implement it. This is what I hope for." (Allied Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Ambassador to France Sato Naotake returned to Tokyo and was appointed Foreign Minister after only one night, which shows how urgently the Hayashi Tenjūrō cabinet needed a full-time Foreign Minister. Sato has served in the diplomatic world for 36 years, of which 31 years have been spent far away in foreign countries, and in China, he only served as Consul in Harbin for three years in 1914. In terms of Sato's service time in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is one year more than Hirota. When he took office as Ambassador to France four years ago, he once traveled to China for only three weeks. Therefore, many Japanese people believe that Sato not only does not have a correct understanding of the situation in China, but also lacks a full understanding of the actual political situation in his own country. However, because he has been stationed in Europe for a long time as a diplomat, his views and thoughts are not different from those who have lived in a corner of East Asia for a long time. Therefore, there are quite a few people who expect that there will be a practical performance in the future "Sato diplomacy." Judging from the general situation, the current diplomatic trend of Japan cannot be completely dominated by the Foreign Minister. Sato's diplomatic methods and extent may be slightly different from other Foreign Ministers, but there cannot be a 180-degree change, which goes without saying. Indeed, the activities of the forces behind Sato are more worthy of our attention than Sato's own policies. Sato's opinion expressed last night after taking office as Foreign Minister, namely, "The diplomatic policy of a country must have continuity," can prove this. As for the selection of the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, it will not be decided until after the parliament is closed, but if Shiratori Toshio is appointed, the future diplomatic trend will be clearer. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to revitalize diplomacy, the new Foreign Minister Sato is scheduled to implement a large-scale change in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in the ambassadors stationed abroad in the near future. Because His Highness Prince Chichibu will travel to Europe, there is a particular need to appoint a successor as soon as possible. It is internally decided to appoint the current Ambassador to Italy Sugimura Yotaro as Ambassador to France, and at the same time appoint Horita, Minister to Switzerland, to succeed Sugimura's original position. (Allied Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The appointment of Japanese Ambassador to France Sato Naotake as Foreign Minister has been praised by observers here, who say that Sato is extremely familiar with European affairs and has been stationed in France for many years. Therefore, his promotion to Foreign Minister is a sign that Japan has a tendency to promote ties with France. However, the general trend of Japanese foreign policy will not undergo major changes as a result of this, because the Hayashi cabinet has already stated that its foreign policy should remain as it was. However, if Sato can achieve the following two things after taking office, the British government will certainly be very satisfied. One is the case last year when British sailors were abused by the Japanese authorities in Keelung Port, Taiwan, which caused protests from the British side. This case has been delayed for several months and has not been resolved. In the future, it is hoped that the Japanese government can find a way to solve this case. The second is that since the United Kingdom, the United States, and France signed the London Naval Treaty in March of last year, Japan has not accepted the qualitative restrictions stipulated in the treaty. Therefore, it is hoped that the Japanese Navy Ministry can accept these restrictions and sign the treaty before the end of this month. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The appointment of Japanese Ambassador to France Sato Naotake as Foreign Minister has elicited few comments from people familiar with Far Eastern affairs, who only praise Sato's diplomatic talents, saying that Sato is one of the most outstanding figures in the old-school diplomatic circles in Japan and belongs to the faction that supports the League of Nations. He has represented the Japanese government at the League of Nations on several occasions, until Japan withdrew from the League of Nations. During the Sino-Japanese Manchurian Incident in 1931, Sato played a crucial role in Geneva's extremely delicate negotiations, maintaining Japanese interests. His effectiveness was remarkable. As Ambassador to France in Paris, his mission was extremely difficult, because France and Russia have been approaching each other in recent years, while the relationship between Japan and Russia has been quite tense. Sato's situation was difficult to cope with. However, until Sato left France, the French people still had great sympathy for him. This could not have been achieved without Sato's extraordinary agility. In addition, general observers believe that Sato has a good feeling for the League of Nations and has been stationed in France for many years. After he takes office as Foreign Minister, he may improve the relations between Japan and France, which may affect the friendship between Japan and Germany. Therefore, they are quite uneasy, which is the same as the uneasiness of the German people when Baron Ishii, the former Japanese Ambassador to France, was promoted to Foreign Minister in previous years. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the promotion of Japanese Ambassador to France Sato Naotake to Foreign Minister, Le Petit Parisien commented, "The French officialdom is extremely pleased with this move, because Ambassador Sato is a close friend of France. He has been stationed in France for four years and has a great deal of sympathy for France. His talent for diplomatic negotiation is also unmatched. His departure is not something that can be forgotten in a moment." The newspaper recounted Sato's experience, stating that he had served as a counselor in the Japanese Embassy in Russia for many years before the European War and was very familiar with the situation in Russia. Now that he has been promoted to Foreign Minister, he will certainly be able to use this experience and make contributions. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the news that Japanese Ambassador to France Sato Naotake had been appointed Foreign Minister of the country reached here, people from the League of Nations warmly welcomed the news, believing that it was a good thing for Japan, and that it would also benefit world peace. Sato never ceases to think about world peace. Furthermore, after Sato's promotion to Foreign Minister, Japan and the technical groups affiliated with the International Association will certainly continue to cooperate. For example, the meeting of the presidium of the Disarmament Conference is scheduled to be held on May 6 of this year, and Japan will definitely send representatives to participate.

<h3>US Senate Passes New Neutrality Law</h3>
<p>Also Effective in Civil Wars; President Has Deciding Power</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today passed the government's proposed Neutrality Law by a vote of 62 to 6, and it was immediately sent to the House for review. The contents of the bill include the following eight points:</p>
<p>1.  All arms, ammunition, and military supplies must be prohibited from export.</p>
<p>2.  Whether other items are prohibited or not is decided by the President.</p>
<p>3.  For belligerent groups, the export of any goods must be prohibited. If a foreign government or agent purchases them and transports them to the belligerent groups, they cannot be prohibited.</p>
<p>4.  Loans to belligerent groups are prohibited.</p>
<p>5.  American citizens are prohibited from traveling on belligerent group ships.</p>
<p>6.  The President has the right to decide whether or not to prohibit belligerent groups from using American ports to transport food.</p>
<p>7.  Armed American ships are prohibited from entering belligerent group ports.</p>
<p>8.  Both sides of a civil war may be considered belligerent groups.</p>
<p>Senator Borah said at the end of the debate that the bill abandoned the maritime freedom policy that the United States has always adhered to, and that the result would be the disregard and attack of other countries. Senator Johnson also opposed the bill's "cash and carry method" and reiterated Borah's words, saying that the United States would be forced to unite with Britain in the Atlantic and with Japan in the Pacific, because Britain and Japan both have strong navies. (National News Agency dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Neutrality Law passed by the Senate today was proposed by Pittman. The highlight of today's discussion was the Republican senators Borah and Vandenberg attacking the United States for abandoning oceanic liberalism. Republican Senator Johnson said that the passage of the bill would be equivalent to depriving Congress of its power to declare war, which is Congress's final and most important responsibility. The various clauses contained in the law will automatically take effect at any time after the President declares the existence of a state of war, and the President also has the right to prohibit American ships from transporting any materials that may endanger the peace of the United States at will. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) An amendment was added, stipulating that if American merchant ships load any items that are prohibited from being transported to belligerent countries under the Neutrality Law, the American government will not protect the merchant ships.

<h3>Roosevelt's Banquet for Quezon</h3>
<p>Preparing for Economic Conference</p>
<p>(Washington) Philippine President Quezon told reporters today that he intends to invite President Roosevelt to visit the Philippines, and expressed his gratitude for President Roosevelt's luncheon today. (3rd National Electric)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt hosted a luncheon today for Philippine Commonwealth President Quezon. Among those invited to accompany were Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Navy Swanson, Secretary of War Woodring, and nineteen other high-ranking officials. This indicates that the future economic negotiations between the United States and the Philippines will be of great importance. The Secretaries of State, Navy, and War will have a significant impact on future U.S. commercial, naval, and military policies related to the Philippines. Undersecretary of State Sayre told the Associated Press today that the two-and-a-half-hour conversation with Quezon was very satisfactory, and that further talks would continue.

<p>(Washington) Several of the most powerful agricultural groups in the country have today informally united to oppose the amendment of the Philippine Independence Act, in order to avoid being detrimental to American farmers. It is reported that representatives of agricultural commissions from thirteen southern states, who are politically influential, are participating in this movement and have begun an "educational campaign" to ensure that national agricultural leaders understand the relationship between the United States and the Philippines. The most important points are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ U.S.-Philippine trade currently has the U.S. in a trade surplus position.</p>
<p>㊁ Filipinos tend to purchase more goods from other countries.</p>
<p>㊂ If the United States makes further concessions to the Philippines, American farmers of rubber, vegetable oil, and sugar will be greatly affected. A spokesperson for these groups stated that if the Independence Act is amended, Congress will not pass anything detrimental to American farmers. Agricultural groups have always supported the Independence Act because it stipulates that after the Philippines becomes independent, its status will be equal to that of other independent nations.

<h3>Britain Willing to Cooperate with U.S. to Create World Peace</h3>
<p>Lord Privy Seal Advocates Expanding Armaments, Hoping to Generate Stable Power in Europe</p>
<p>(London) Lord Privy Seal Halifax declared in the House of Lords today, "Our efforts, whether in diplomacy, military affairs, or industry, are all based on a single goal, namely, to build peace on the foundation of justice. Only justice can support the edifice and allow all nations to rest in peace."</p>
<p>Halifax elaborated on the rearmament and described the mission of surveillance ships in the Spanish Civil War, stating that these ships do not have the right to arrest or search, but can only identify the names of ships entering Spanish ports and whether they are complying with the agreement, and allow observers to board the ships. Otherwise, everything else remains the same. The British government is now responsible for protecting its own ships. A member asked whether there were observers from other countries stationed on the warships. Halifax said that the Spanish coast has now been divided into sections, each monitored by warships from different countries, and there seems to be no need for observers from other countries to be stationed on the warships.</p>
<p>Regarding the danger of isolation, Halifax said, "We will neither be isolated nor willingly isolated; it is impossible. How the future will be is difficult to predict, but the current government's policy is very clear."</p>
<p>Halifax added, "I am also quite concerned about the possibility of disputes occurring in Eastern Europe. I have not forgotten that these disputes, related to the Franco-Soviet pact, will trigger an even greater crisis in Western Europe. Therefore, if we are to adopt a certain attitude towards hypothetical disputes in Central and Eastern Europe, it is impossible to say at once that we have put the affairs of Central and Eastern Europe out of our minds. Furthermore, we have repeatedly stated that we are willing to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant, but if these obligations cannot be precisely defined, it is a defect of the League of Nations Covenant itself. Although the League of Nations is now weak, British power has not diminished in the slightest, and we are willing to do our best to prevent conflicts from occurring. Some say that Britain's military build-up is due to the imminent threat of future wars, but in fact, we have no such pessimistic thoughts. We firmly believe that the stronger Britain's military is, the less likely war will occur. Britain's military is not a selfish military, nor is it for aggression, but rather, we hope that in the future, a stable power can emerge among the countries of Europe."</p>
<p>Halifax continued, "I know that there will inevitably come a time when a lower level of military balance can be consulted between countries, so as to avoid countries competing in armaments out of necessity. The British government also deeply hopes that this time will come soon. We sincerely welcome agreements that promote peace, no matter when or where. We still firmly believe in the ideals of the League of Nations, but if we do not have the strength to fulfill our duties, it will be in vain."</p>
<p>Halifax concluded that the British government would offer sympathetic assistance to any path that could lead to the realm of peace. Britain has previously dealt with all European issues based on this spirit, and hopes to obtain the cooperation of the United States in this spirit. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>British Army Budget is £82 Million</h3>
<p>£26 Million More Than Last Year; Hong Kong to Hold Joint Naval, Land, and Air Exercises</p>
<p>(London) This year's army estimates were released this morning, totaling £63,312,000, an increase of £7,239,000 over last year, including supplementary estimates. £19,054,000 for the equipment and public works expenses of the standing army will be appropriated from the unified fund under the National Defence Loan Act. If this clause is included, the total amount of the army estimates for 1937 will be £82,174,000, which will exceed £26,293,000 over last year. In the memorandum attached to the army estimates, Secretary of War Cooper pointed out that there are two points that make this year's estimates less clear than last year's. The first point is that last year, the construction cost of government factories was £551,800, which was included in the army estimates, but this year, the cost of £794,600 has been changed to the artillery factory estimates, and there is the same amount of subsidy allocated from the unified fund, which is listed in the estimates. The second point is that last year there was a special expense of £2,800,000 related to the Italian-Abyssinian War, but this year this item has been deleted. As for the number of army personnel, excluding those serving in India, the total number is 168,900, compared to 158,400 in 1936 and 186,400 in 1914. This year, a total of 47,200 new recruits are needed. The current number of recruits is not yet sufficient, but Cooper plans to find other ways to remedy this. As it stands, the physical standards have now been modified, and defects in the feet can now be disregarded due to the mechanization of the army. Cooper's memorandum included descriptions of improvements to barracks construction, such as hot air, hot water, and new cooking facilities. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Singapore) Hong Kong will hold joint naval, land, and air exercises within the month. One thousand troops from Singapore will participate, accounting for one of the two battalions of the Singapore garrison. They will travel by submarine HMS Medway, arriving in Hong Kong around March 8 and returning in mid-April. At least one squadron of the Royal Air Force from RAF Seletar will participate, and Air Vice-Marshal Maltby, Commander of the Far East Air Force, will also attend. Furthermore, the current defensive strength of Hong Kong consists of three infantry battalions and units from various corps, such as artillery units, engineering units, and signal units. The artillery units also include two anti-aircraft squadrons, and six aircraft will cooperate with the anti-aircraft units in exercises. It is expected that the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes, carrying twenty fighter planes, will participate as part of the opposing force. Furthermore, the cruiser HMS Cumberland, which remained in the port of Malaya after the Singapore defense exercises, will set sail for Hong Kong on March 10. Other warships participating, in addition to the Medway submarine and the Hermes aircraft carrier, include eleven submarines, eight destroyers, and two small warships, which are already en route to Hong Kong.

<h3>Japan Emphasizes British and American Shipbuilding</h3>
<p>Researching Ways to Respond</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British naval budget for 1937 totals £100,506,500 (an actual increase of £23,776,600 over the previous year). The aim of this new arms expansion plan is to maintain the construction of an invincible navy. The United States' $526 million has been passed by Congress, indicating a determination to build the only modern navy. The shipbuilding competition between the two countries has now taken its first concrete step. The Japanese Navy attaches great importance to this matter and will vigorously expand its independent economic and military preparedness. At the same time, it will quickly implement the Third Supplementary Plan and carefully study the new British and American naval plans that go beyond the quantitative limits stipulated in the Washington and London treaties, and then seek countermeasures.

<h3>Italian Fascist Party's Population Policy</h3>
<p>Clever Methods; Encouraging Reproduction</p>
<p>(Rome) The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party continued its meeting last night at 10:00 PM and adjourned at 3:00 AM this morning. First, Minister of the Interior Bottai reported on the population issue, and a resolution was immediately passed to improve the current population policy in accordance with the following principles:</p>
<p>㊀ Those with many children should enjoy priority in seeking employment, because when the country encounters extraordinary circumstances, the families that provide the most men and suffer the greatest sacrifices are those with large populations.</p>
<p>㊁ The size of wages should be proportional to the number of dependents in the family. In other words, for those with the same job and equal performance, the wages earned should be determined by the burden on the family.</p>
<p>㊂ Existing methods used to stabilize the livelihoods of families with large populations should be improved.</p>
<p>㊃ The state should provide marriage loans to those who marry and the state should organize special insurance to protect the lives of workers' widows.</p>
<p>㊄ A national federation should be organized for families with large populations.</p>
<p>㊅ The boundaries of provinces, villages, and towns should be re-demarcated in accordance with the latest population statistics, and those with too many elderly people and a declining population should be immediately abolished.</p>
<p>㊅ A central agency should be established to promote and monitor the implementation of population policies.</p>
<p>This resolution believes that without people, the country has no youth, no military strength, no economic development, no security, and no future. Therefore, the population issue is called "the greatest of all problems." (Central News Agency, Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Italian Veterans to Assemble Next Month</h3>

<p>◎ Madrid: According to a report in the Claridad newspaper, government troops have occupied Toledo and part of the area near the Alcázar fortress. The National Army resisted fiercely beforehand. Toledo is the capital of Toledo province, located on the Tagus River, 50 miles southwest of Madrid. It was once the capital of Spain. The battle lasted for 23 hours, and the National Army suffered heavy losses. Later, about 30,000 government troops crossed the Tagus River between Talavera and Toledo and advanced on the railway and the highway between Talavera and Toledo, which the National Army relied on as a source of support from the Talavera side. Furthermore, the National Army once attempted to cut off the highway between Madrid and Valencia, but this plan failed. After four hours of shelling and charging, the National Army retreated to its original defensive line, and the ground was covered with corpses. The government also claimed that the area west of Oviedo city has fallen into the hands of the government army, so traffic to Oviedo has been completely cut off by the government army. However, according to news from the National Army, 400 militiamen from the government side have surrendered to the National Army on the west bank of the Tagus River. They were forcibly conscripted from Valencia and sent to the front immediately after joining the army. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>◎ Madrid: Regarding the news reported by the Luz newspaper that the government army had entered Toledo, a city south of the capital, General Miaja, chairman of the Defense Committee, recently stated that this news has not yet been confirmed.

In addition, there are contacts between the two sides on all fronts, especially near the university area in the western suburbs of the city. At the former beach of Motril city (southeast of Malaga port) in the south, the government army is slowly advancing. (Central News Agency, Havas, 4th)</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Discusses China's Insurance Law</h3>
<p>(London) At a meeting of the House of Commons today, Conservative MP Moreland reiterated questions about China's insurance law. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that he had received a report from Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British ambassador to China, stating that the Chinese government promulgated the revised insurance law on November 11 of last year, and attached implementing regulations, one of which stipulates that insurance policies must be printed in Chinese. If foreign languages are also used, the Chinese version shall prevail. At the same time, the law regarding insurance completion has been published, but it is heard that it has not yet been implemented. He has not received any further information, but detailed reports are sent regularly. The Foreign Secretary also answered another question, saying that he has not heard that the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the Sichuan Provincial Government not to allow foreigners or their representatives to engage in the insurance business in any non-treaty port inland, but he has asked the ambassador to China to report on this matter.

<h3>Improvement of Economic Conditions After the French Popular Front Government Took Office</h3>
<p>(Paris) Since the Blanc government took office last June, the economic situation in France has gradually improved. Recently, signs of recovery have become increasingly evident. Examples are provided below:</p>
<p>㊀ In the first seven weeks of this year, the total railway income nationwide increased by more than 12% compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>㊁ Savings deposits increased by as much as 223,000,000 francs in the first two months of this year.</p>
<p>㊂ Tax revenue in January this year totaled 2,900,000,000 francs, an increase of 233,000,000 francs compared to January last year. The increase in indirect taxes, income tax, and securities and exchange transaction taxes was particularly significant.</p>
<p>㊃ After the implementation of the 40-hour work week, the national output did not decrease. For example, steel production in January this year was 603,000 tons, an increase of 12,000 tons compared to December last year and 42,000 tons compared to November last year. Pig iron production in January this year was 587,000 tons, an increase of 19,000 tons compared to December last year and 78,000 tons compared to January last year.</p>
<p>㊄ The number of unemployed has decreased by 70,000 compared to last year, and localized unemployment has almost completely disappeared. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Impressions of the 96th Session of the League of Nations Council</h3>
<p>Satisfactory Results on Important Issues, Ambassador Gu Highly Praised by All Countries</p>
<p>Geneva Correspondence: The 96th session of the League of Nations Council has concluded. It was held six times from January 21st to 28th. This was the first council meeting of the year. Although the meeting encountered considerable difficulties, it achieved considerable success. It is not only a glorious record in the history of the League of Nations but also a model for future meetings. European public opinion calls this result a revival of the League of Nations because several important issues were handled appropriately and the results were satisfactory.</p>
<p>First, the Dispute Between Turkey and France</p>
<p>Before the Council meeting, Turkey insisted on the complete independence of the Sanjak of Alexandretta. Negotiations between Turkey and France were nearly deadlocked. A dense fog shrouded the Mediterranean, adding another layer of worry. At that time, there were rumors that Turkey would use force to resolve the issue. If that had happened, the League of Nations would have faced another threat of collapse. However, these two member states did not follow the example of their predecessors, nor did they seek solutions outside the League of Nations. Instead, they entrusted the issue to the Council for resolution, demonstrating their trust in the League of Nations and their adherence to the covenant. The Council's handling of the issue satisfied both parties, and they sincerely accepted it. Thus, an extremely serious problem was averted and brought under the rule of law and culture. As a result, the relations between the two countries returned to normal. In fact, the people of both sides have benefited immensely. This immense benefit was entirely due to trust in the League of Nations and adherence to the covenant, which can serve as an example for the future. Because in the past, if the League of Nations dealt with disputes between two member states with the consent of Country A, it would inevitably be rejected by Country B. There is always one who "obeys the covenant" and one who "breaks the covenant." The Sino-Japanese issue, the Bolivia-Paraguay dispute, and the Italo-Ethiopian War were different, and the countries were of different strengths, but "obeying" and "breaking" are the same. Because there were precedents of breaking the covenant, observers were not optimistic about the Turkish-French issue beforehand. Afterwards, they had infinite hope for the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Second, the Danzig Issue</p>
<p>Since Germany withdrew from the League, the Danzig issue has become increasingly serious, almost becoming the center of conflict between Germany, Poland, and the League of Nations. The power of the German Nazi Party in Danzig is expanding, and those who do not sympathize with the Germanic people face threats of terror. Even League of Nations High Commissioner Sean Lester has been insulted. The "free city" under the rule of the League of Nations has gradually lost its freedom. Danzig, located in northeastern Europe, harbors many crises. This was especially evident during the 93rd session of the Council in October last year. Danzig Senate President Greiser did not speak in the tone of a representative of the citizens at the Council meeting but instead expressed threats on behalf of the Nazi Party. He declared that he would no longer come to Geneva. Therefore, the Danzig issue could not be discussed at the 94th and 95th sessions of the Council. However, Greiser came to Geneva again and appeared at the 96th session. This time, his attitude was very mild and polite. He expressed his agreement with the new High Commissioner appointed by the Council and expressed his willingness to cooperate. He stated that his relationship with the High Commissioner was entirely based on the law. Although this result is related to the political changes in Europe over the past few months, it actually demonstrates the efforts of the Committee of Three. The Council achieved another success.</p>
<p>Third, the Dispute Between Chile and Spain Regarding Refugees</p>
<p>This issue was not originally on the agenda but was initiated by the Chilean representative on an ad hoc basis. The Chilean representative requested the Spanish government to guarantee the safety of refugees seeking asylum in embassies because Chile believed that the Spanish government's massacre of fugitives violated international conventions. The debate between the Chilean and Spanish representatives turned into a heated debate with the Soviet representative, but the Council ultimately achieved the goal of mediation. Chinese representative Gu, as chairman and rapporteur, traveled between the representatives of Chile and Spain dozens of times. With the assistance of Eden (UK) and Delbos (France), everyone worked hard to achieve a satisfactory resolution. Both parties agreed to direct negotiations. This was the last gathering of the session. That afternoon, the Council held a closed meeting, then an open meeting, until it adjourned at 8:30 PM. Representative Gu's report was unanimously adopted by the Council, preventing a minor issue from becoming a major one. It can also be said that the Council achieved another success. Both parties expressed their gratitude for Representative Gu's painstaking mediation efforts.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Issue of Freedom of Speech for Representatives of the Press Stationed at the League of Nations</p>
<p>In recent years, members of the International Association of Journalists stationed at the League of Nations whose articles opposed Fascism have often been suppressed or expelled by the Swiss government. Switzerland, which is universally regarded as the most developed democratic country, seems to have been unable to maintain its spirit of permanent neutrality because it is situated between two major Fascist powers. It has also been unable to fulfill its legal responsibility to protect political prisoners from both countries. However, the aforementioned journalists' association, based on a resolution passed by the League of Nations General Assembly in 1926, argues that League of Nations member states have a responsibility to ensure that the League understands that without the cooperation of the press, the work of the League and its peaceful purposes cannot be understood by the people of the world. The Swiss government had already accepted the aforementioned resolution at that time, but for several years, it had not interfered with statements that opposed democratic politics or harmed relations with other countries. However, it has uniquely suppressed statements related to Germany and Italy. Council Chairman Gu, after receiving a written statement from the journalists' association, raised the issue for discussion in a closed meeting. The representatives of the Council expressed their indignation and passed a motion to accept and handle the issue, organizing a five-member committee (China, UK, France, Sweden, Poland) to study the matter and report back to the next session. The Council's acceptance of a problem between a private organization and a small country's government is also rare in the history of the League of Nations. Journalists stationed at the League of Nations and the European press regard the attitude of the Council Chairman and the councilors as a manifestation of the League's respect for freedom of speech, which is enough to promote a deeper understanding and sympathy for the League of Nations in public opinion. This can also be considered one of the achievements of this session of the Council. In this unfavorable environment, the Council has achieved satisfactory results on the aforementioned several important issues, and its efforts have not been in vain. Therefore, it has gained special respect from public opinion. On the day the Council adjourned, the Journal de Genève stated: "The 96th session of the Council has adjourned. The League of Nations has never been so vigorous. The 96th session is the most satisfactory. It has restored people's hopes for peace because the councilors can take responsibility and can see the big picture on important issues. At the beginning of 1937, the councilors of the Council took responsibility to ensure that the people of all countries celebrate the guarantee of the League of Nations' peaceful organization..." Speaking of our Representative Gu, the newspaper said: "...The 96th session of the Council has proved the talent of Chairman Gu Weijun... Other newspapers have praised him even more beyond description, praising Representative Gu's keenness and experience no less than praising the League of Nations."</p>
<p>It is noted that this is the third time that our country has taken the chairmanship of the Council. The first time was in 1922 when Representative Gu first served as chairman, the second time was in 1927, when our country's then-Ambassador to France Chen Lu served as chairman, and this time it was Representative Gu's second time as chairman. Mr. Gu was a member of the League of Nations Covenant Drafting Committee seventeen years ago and can be said to be one of the League of Nations' elders. However, people here mostly call him a young diplomat, as his appearance leads them to suspect that he is in his thirties. They do not know that three days after the closing of the session, it will be his 50th birthday. It is thought that Ambassador Gu's return with praise will be even more spiritually pleasant than his friends' birthday wishes. (Central News Agency, Geneva, January 30)</p>
<h3>Bandits in Nan'an, Fujian Province, Collude with Ronin</h3>
<p>Multiple Robberies and Murders Occur in Jintao District. Notorious Bandit Huang Sanqi Arrested in Xiamen. Bandits and Ronin Have Secret Organizations</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Jintao in the second district of Nan'an County, Quanzhou Prefecture, is a border area where the three counties of Anxi, Nan'an, and Yongchun meet. In the past, bandits and communists roamed around, making it notoriously difficult to govern. Last year, after the stationed troops suppressed them, the bandits and communists collapsed, and the local area gradually became peaceful. Unexpectedly, in February of this year, multiple robberies and murders occurred in the Jintao district, and it was discovered that bad elements were colluding with Ronin and had secret organizations. On February 15, the Chen Kaishu and Chen Douchi stores on Xiaxu Street in the district were robbed. The bandits cut off the power lines along the way, creating a very rampant situation. Subsequently, Fang Guo'an, the director of the Qianjin Temple United Security Office in the second district of Nan'an, reported the truth of the incident, stating: "On the 15th of this month, I was ordered by the county government to supervise the chiefs and militiamen to go to the county government for exercises. Unexpectedly, that night, Huang Sanqi from Louxia Township colluded with four Ronin, carrying short guns. They first entered the Huang family's Shisun house in the township, searched for Huang Chi's self-defense Mauser pistol, claiming to be under the orders of the headquarters. When Huang resisted, he was tied up in a nearby dilapidated house. They then went to Xiaxu Street and knocked on the doors of Chen Kaishu and Chen Douchi's stores, pretending to buy things. Three entered the room, and two guarded the door, claiming to collect donations. Suddenly, they claimed to be under the orders of the headquarters to handle a case here and were short of travel expenses, asking to borrow several hundred yuan. They eventually extorted more than two hundred yuan. The merchants immediately sounded the alarm, gathered the militiamen to pursue, but failed to capture them. Huang Chi managed to escape home the next morning. Huang Sanqi was previously wanted. Now, he dares to collude with Ronin to go to the township to tie up and search, which has been reported to the government for strict investigation," and so on. Based on this, it can be proven that local bandits colluded with Ronin. On the 25th, Xie Konghuai of Dongmen Township in Jintao was also robbed of more than 1,300 yuan. In addition, Huang Mao, a general merchandise merchant, went missing in Houkeng Township. His body was later found near the Shen'an United Security Office, stabbed more than seventy times, and the 218 yuan he was carrying was also stolen. After these cases occurred, the district office learned that Huang had come to Xiamen a month ago to lead four Ronin from a certain direction back to Jintao. After the robbery, Huang returned to Xiamen. Fang Guo'an, the director of the second district United Security Office, led two militiamen to Xiamen a few days ago and met with the detective team of the Xiamen Municipal Police Bureau to find out that Huang was hiding in a certain place in Caozaian. At 7:00 PM on March 1, all the detectives went to the address and arrested Huang. He is currently being held at the headquarters, awaiting a letter from the Nan'an County government to transfer him. Huang is a notorious bandit in Jintao, who usually runs rampant in the countryside, and many people have been ravaged by him. This time, he colluded with Ronin, which is especially hated by the villagers. It is also said that the secret organization in Jintao is called the "Action Team," which is an organization of bandits and Ronin from a certain direction. (March 3)</p>
<h3>Poison Also Found in Chaoshan Salt</h3>
<p>Salt in Two Salt Factories in Raoping County Sealed Off. Similar to the Poisoned Salt in Southern Fujian Last Month. It is Said That the Poisoning Was Done by Ronin and Traitors.</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The coastal area of Chaoshan is a salt-producing area. Every year, salt is transported and sold to the counties in Chaozhou, Meizhou, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces, totaling more than six million dan, which is a major source of national tax revenue. In recent years, Ronin from a certain country have been causing trouble in the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong, engaging in drug trafficking and smuggling by any means possible. Last month, it was discovered in Putian, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen in Fujian Province that poison had been added to the salt, which alarmed southern Fujian for a time. Unexpectedly, the Xingji and Jitong salt factories in Raoping County in Chaozhou have recently had the same discovery as in southern Fujian. All salt that is white and transparent, crystallized into a rectangular shape, has no salty taste, tastes acidic, slightly bitter, seems to be gelatinous, and melts when exposed to fire. The salt found in the Xingji factory is probably the same as that in Putian and Xinghua in Fujian Province. After the news spread, it was rumored in all counties of Chaoshan, causing panic in the city. The Raoping County government immediately sealed off the salt for thorough chemical examination and investigation. According to a letter from Putian, Fujian Province, three weeks ago, a strange epidemic was discovered in Putian, where patients suffered from abdominal distension, with the belly swelling up like a ball, solid and shiny. Within a day or two, the intestines rotted, and even the belly rotted. Doctors were helpless, and it became an incurable disease. The life expectancy was at most ten days. In Xianyou, Zhangzhou, and other places, dozens of people have died as a result. Later, Xianyou discovered that poison had been added to the salt warehouse. The residents of Zhangzhou and Xiamen checked the salt themselves and also discovered white, crystalline substances. Therefore, last month, there was panic in southern Fujian County. Those who bought salt were all very careful. It has been found that privateers and Ronin often travel to and transport smuggled goods in the salt-producing areas of Nanli, Pinghai, Meizhou, and Dongshan in Fujian Province. Therefore, the people of Fujian unanimously suspect that the poison in the salt must have been done by Ronin from a certain country. Now that similar incidents have been discovered in Raoping, the salt-producing areas of Chaozhou, such as Haishan, Dongjie, Dagang, Fuxun, and Hongmen, are also places where treacherous and Ronin travel. Therefore, the military and political officers of Chaoshan are particularly concerned. According to reports, Division Commander Li Hanhun of the stationed army specially obtained various types of salt from salt-producing areas and salt factories and handed them over to the Shantou Municipal Hospital for chemical examination to determine whether they had been poisoned and what the composition of the poison was. The Shantou Municipal Hospital did not have the necessary equipment for chemical examination. Therefore, Li took them to Guangzhou and handed them over to the Zhongda Medical Department for chemical examination. The Raoping County government has sealed off the Xingji and Jitong salt factories and prohibits them from being sold, awaiting the results of the chemical examination, and has reported the details to the division headquarters, the administrative office, the Fourth Route Army headquarters, the provincial government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and other agencies for filing. It also ordered the subordinate district and township offices to strictly inspect coastal areas for suspicious people poisoning the salt fields.</p>
<h3>Kunshan Actively Prepares to Establish a Sports Association</h3>
<p>Since the public sports field in this county was abolished, the promotion of public sports has been lacking. Recently, the county party department was ordered to organize a county sports association and district, township, and town branches. A preparatory committee has now been established, with Zhu Fukang and eight others elected as members to be responsible for actively carrying out the work. They are currently soliciting members and drafting regulations, and it is expected to be established in early April, when national physical training will be implemented.</p>
<h3>Feng Wangyi of Suzhou Arrested for Fraud</h3>
<p>Lu Jimei and Lu Pan Quanchun, a wealthy couple on Fenghuang Street in Fengmen, have a deep addiction. The county government has repeatedly ordered them to abstain but they have not complied. They have been arrested and sent to the county hospital for compulsory abstinence. A man named Feng Wangyi, who used to be an adjutant to a certain division stationed in Suzhou, knew that Lu was afraid of being convicted. He contacted Lu, offering to bribe the county's opium suppression authorities and to use his influence in the press to avoid punishment. Lu believed him and agreed to pay 1,000 yuan, with 700 yuan to be used to bribe the county's opium suppression authorities and 300 yuan to be used to influence the press. It was agreed that the money would be paid on the 4th. The county government's opium case investigation office learned of this and sent judges Du and Zhang to the county hospital to arrest Feng Wangyi. They found two Shanghai Bank checks for 500 yuan each on his person. They took Feng Wangyi back to the county government and detained him pending interrogation.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Levy Land Value Tax</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Wuxian Land Administration Bureau has been gradually completing the task of carrying out land surveying and registration throughout the county. In order to implement the land value tax in the urban area as soon as possible, the county government ordered the Land Administration Bureau on the 4th to submit the names of the landowners who have completed registration in the urban area to the county government by the end of May, so as to prepare all the procedures. As for the investigation of land prices in the urban area, the township and town offices will report them to the county government.</p>
<h3>A Dreadful Meningitis Epidemic in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Tan Shouren, the preparation director of this county's health office, said that due to the recent bad weather, a meningitis epidemic has broken out, spreading to residents in Guangcheng and other townships. Everyone is cautious about diet and daily life and warns each other. The office has organized an epidemic prevention team to give injections as a central task. More than 600 people have been vaccinated against meningitis in recent days. At present, Meiyuan, Guangqin district, and Xinduqiao in the fourth district have become dangerous areas and are threatening to spread to the urban area and the entire county. In order to prevent the spread, the office convened a second emergency epidemic prevention meeting yesterday and decided: (1) to expand the epidemic prevention organization, (2) to inform the police bureau and instruct them to assist in epidemic prevention, (3) to report the current state of the meningitis epidemic in this county and the office's epidemic prevention work to the Department of Civil Affairs and request that nearby counties be notified to take precautions to prevent the spread, (4) to apply for epidemic prevention funds and establish a temporary epidemic hospital, and to send doctor Zheng Fuxi to Beijing to purchase a large batch of meningitis vaccines from the Central Health Administration for a large-scale epidemic prevention campaign.</p>
<h3>Youth Commits Suicide by Lying on Railroad Tracks</h3>
<p>Xiao Chu, the 16-year-old son of Jiang A'xiang, a resident of No. 32 Shuigoutou, outside the West Gate, dropped out of school and stayed at home. He could not find a job. Recently, Xiao Chu made a slight mistake and was beaten by his father. He left home alone. At about 7:00 PM on the 3rd, he walked to the vicinity of Yangqi outside the West Gate of the Wuxi Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway and lay down on the tracks, committing suicide. At that time, a train came, cutting him in half at the eyebrows, almost in two pieces. He died instantly, with blood and flesh blurred and internal organs ruptured, a terrible sight. The next day, his parents were informed and went to identify the body. They confirmed that it was their son and mourned over the body, which was heartbreaking.</p>
<h3>The Labor Unrest at Changzhou Minfeng Factory Has Not Yet Subsided</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 2nd, all the female workers at the Minfeng Yarn Factory outside Xiaonanmen in Wuyi County went on strike. The police bureau sent officers to the factory to maintain order and urged them to return to work. On the morning of the 3rd, the female workers rushed into the factory gate and destroyed the workers' and students' classrooms and storage rooms. The police bureau and the security team sent additional police to guard the area. Jiang Dingsheng, the director of the trade union preparatory committee, went to the factory to mediate and urged the female workers to elect representatives to negotiate. As a result, Zhou Heying, Zhou Yundi, and 47 others were elected to present seven demands to the county party department: ㊀ Request to restore the previously reduced wages, ㊁ Request to abolish the training class students, ㊂ Workers should not be dismissed without cause, ㊃ Restore the dismissed supervisors and workers without fault, ㊄ Workers' wages should be clearly stated daily earnings and paid on a daily basis, ㊅ The factory should not force workers to bear the responsibilities of training students and handicraft workers, ㊆ Chen Yucuan, the director of the training department, and Sun Jinsheng, the work inspector of the weaving department, should be replaced. Police Chief Xu Baoguang, together with Jiang Dingsheng, contacted the factory about the above conditions and negotiated twice at the county party department, but there was no concrete solution. Feng Jingheng, the representative of the factory, promised to reply again on the 4th. Some of the female workers also dispersed and returned home at night. The factory's strike losses are more than 10,000 yuan per day, and the damage to property is not included.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Jingcheng Road Limits Demolition of Civilian Houses</h3>
<p>The Jingcheng Road in Yangzhou City, which is under construction, has long been surveyed for the road alignment and the bidding has been submitted for approval. Later, due to the problem of the road alignment, the Department of Construction repeatedly received complaints, and ordered the county to transfer the bureau to draw detailed drawings for approval, so it was suspended. The civilian houses within the surveyed line have not yet been demolished. The county bureau has now received an order from the Department approving the construction according to the original surveyed road alignment. In addition to notifying the construction factory that won the bid to come to the bureau to complete the formalities for signing a contract, it has also limited the owners of civilian houses within the road alignment to demolish them within a month, and it is said that the new West Gate will be opened in ten days.</p>
<h3>Rioters Gather in Houzhen Village, Danyang</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the squadron of the 5th Security Brigade stationed in Quanzhou Town reported by the town chief Tang Shiyong that a large number of rioters gathered to discuss matters at the home of Tang Yibao in Houzhen Village, requesting detention and punishment. The squadron immediately went to arrest them with live ammunition and found dozens of people gathered to discuss matters. They went forward to surround and arrest them, but the rioters fled in all directions. As a result, only Tang Bangrui, Wang Dabian, Zhong Jinbao, Xu Geng'er, Yue Lingao, Wang Bingsheng, Tang Jinbao, Wu Yisheng, and Gong Zhanfa, a Jiangbei native, were captured, and a White Langlin pistol with ten bullets was found beside Wang Dabian, an iron ruler was found on Tang Bangrui's waist, and an axe was found beside Zhanfa. The squadron tied up all the people along with the murder weapons and escorted them to the city and sent them to the squadron headquarters for verification. It is now learned that after the questioning by squadron commander Zhai, Tang Bangrui asked someone to bail him out, and the rest of the people were sent to the brigade headquarters along with the documents to the county for verification.</p>
<h3>Nantong Water Police Team's Measures to Protect Fishing</h3>
<p>The spring yellow croaker fishing season in the coastal area of northern Jiangsu is approaching. Zhu Aizhou, the commander of the third water police district, convened all the squadron leaders and captains to discuss the measures to protect fishing: ㊀ From April 10th, the Junhe and Haiying patrol ships and the patrol boats belonging to the second squadron will be responsible for protection in the Shengsi fishing area. ㊁ From April 5th, the patrol boats of the second and third squadrons will be responsible for protection in the Zhongsha fishing area. ㊂ The special squadron's patrol boats will be inspected and defended by district inspectors. ㊃ Shen Zaiquan, the chief inspector of the Shengsi fishing area, will be stationed at Xun and direct the defense. ㊄ The district headquarters will send an inspector to the Dongsha fishing area to be stationed at Xun and direct the defense.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Builds Cao Hao Wharf</h3>
<p>The Shao-Xiao Tangzha Engineering Office previously found that the Cao'e Hao Dam had as many as eleven dry gates built by the Guo Tanghang for loading and unloading goods, which was very dangerous. It was decided to build one or two public wharfs at that place and fill in the original dry gates. The plan has now been drafted and the estimated cost is 5,000 yuan, which will be paid from the annual repair item. It has been submitted to the Department of Construction for approval yesterday.</p>
<h3>Yuyao Prepares to Establish Textile Company</h3>
<p>Yuyao cotton is known for its white color and pure quality, with an annual output of over two million dan, ranking first in all of Zhejiang Province. However, the cotton merchants who trade in it often suffer losses. The reason for this is that they are controlled by others and cannot be independent. Yuyao cotton must be transported to Ningbo and undergo drying and inspection. If the drying and inspection are not satisfactory, they will lose at least three or four yuan per pair. Moreover, market prices fluctuate rapidly. These two reasons are the biggest difficulties for Yuyao cotton traders. Shanghai-based Ningbo merchants such as Xu Qianlin, seeing that Zhouxing Town's commerce has become exceptionally prosperous since the establishment of a central station in Ziguan Cao in that town, plan to raise a large amount of capital to establish a textile company in the town, in order to revitalize industry.</p>

<h3>Income Tax Office's Reply to Chamber of Commerce Letter</h3>
<p>Adopting Both Actual Receipt and Payment Systems; Officials to Study in Detail</p>
<p>The Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, in response to a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting the concurrent adoption of an actual receipt and payment system, replied to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying: "Regarding your Chamber's official letter No. 320, dated February 20th of this year, concerning the Research Association for the Collection of Income Tax, based on a proposal from the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, construction companies that contract for projects may not be able to complete their projects for several years, and payments are also made in installments over several years. Currently, the draft Collection Guidelines for Category 1 adopt an accrual system. If a business takes several years to complete, the actual receipts of the following year will inevitably be included in the current year, which is equivalent to having the taxes payable in the following year paid in advance in the current year, causing difficulties for merchants. Please revise the Collection Guidelines to avoid obstructions." Approved. In addition to referring the requested revision of the Collection Guidelines to the responsible personnel for detailed study, we hereby reply accordingly. Please take note."</p>
<h3>Zhang Fang Talks About the Severity of the Henan Disaster</h3>
<p>Over Nine Million Disaster Victims Awaiting Relief; Report to All Sectors Today</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, Zhang Fang, a member of the Central Committee and chairman of the Henan Provincial Accounting Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the 27th of last month. He has been visiting various parties in recent days to discuss raising funds for disaster relief. He is scheduled to host a reception for all sectors at 4 p.m. today on the eighth floor of the Hua An Apartment to report on the disaster situation. Zhang will also meet with the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council, Song Ziwen and Chen Shang, to discuss ways to implement work relief. After Zhu Qinglan, who is waiting to inspect the disaster area, returns to Shanghai for a meeting, Zhang will return to Henan to preside over disaster relief matters.</p>
<p>Vast Disaster Area</p>
<p>A Xin Xin News Agency reporter visited Zhang at his residence yesterday to inquire about the disaster situation in Henan Province and the implementation of relief measures. According to him, Henan Province has been plagued by frequent disasters in recent years, the rural economy has been exhausted, and the people's plight is already unspeakable. Who knew that since the spring of last year, the weather has been unfavorable, with excessive rain and droughts, followed by insect infestations and hail, resulting in complete crop failure. The land has become barren, and people are constantly fleeing. The disaster area covers 93 counties, accounting for nine-tenths of the entire province, with over 9 million disaster victims. The most severely affected areas are the 30-odd counties in southern Henan, such as Huangchuan. The extent of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster are rare.</p>
<p>Roads Filled with Refugees</p>
<p>Although the central government and various charitable organizations have successively allocated and raised emergency relief funds of over 1 million yuan, and the provincial government has issued funds to carry out price stabilization and loans of grain, due to the severity of the disaster and the large number of disaster victims, it is like a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. Therefore, most of the young and strong disaster victims have fled to Hubei, Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, while the elderly and weak have no way to find food and have become starving corpses. The situation is truly unbearable to witness. Recently, a telegram was received from the provincial government stating that thousands upon thousands of disaster victims have been flocking to the provincial capital to beg for relief.</p>
<p>Raising Funds in Shanghai</p>
<p>This time, I accompanied Chairman Shang (Zhen) to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, where I specifically requested relief from the central government. The central government has already sent Zhu Qinglan, the chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, to investigate. This time, I came to Shanghai and visited Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Wang Yiting, and Mr. Qu Wenliu to discuss raising disaster relief funds. I have also received the support of these gentlemen to solicit donations from all sectors. However, for the sake of active relief, I plan to implement well-digging, canal-dredging, and road-repair work relief. Therefore, I plan to visit Mr. Song Ziwen in the coming days to discuss everything. I also hope that compatriots across the country will generously donate and provide relief to save the lives of the 9 million disaster victims in Henan Province.</p>
<h3>Huang Xuchu Returns South Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yu Junxian Travels on the Same Ship</p>
<p>Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, came to Shanghai after the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee to handle private matters. On the evening of the 3rd, Chen Guangfu, General Manager of Shanghai Bank, and Zou Bingwen, Manager, hosted a banquet for Huang at the International Hotel, and invited many leaders from all sectors of the city to accompany him. During the banquet, they exchanged views on developing Guangxi's industries and the atmosphere was very pleasant. Huang went to the Xinguang Wharf at 4 p.m. yesterday (the 4th) and boarded the Yikang, a small steamer owned by the China Alcohol Company, to board the American postal ship President Wilson to return south. The ship set sail at 5 p.m. People from Shanghai's industrial circles and related parties, such as Yu Qiaqing, Zou Bingwen, Huang Huabiao, and Shi Yucun, went to the wharf to see him off. According to Huang, Liu Weizhang will take the President McKinley to Hong Kong and return to Guangxi on the 5th. In addition, Yu Junxian, a member of the Central Committee, returned south on the same ship yesterday.</p>
<h3>Yu Hanmou, Chen Ce, etc. Change Return to Guangdong to Tonight Again</h3>
<p>Because the President McKinley's Arrival in Shanghai Was Delayed</p>
<p>Yu Hanmou, Director of the Pacification Headquarters in Guangdong, Chen Ce, Commander of the Humen Fortress, and Liu Weizhi, Director of the Guangdong Construction Department, etc., were waiting to board the President McKinley of the Da Lai Company to return to Guangdong. It was originally scheduled to board the ship last night and depart from Shanghai this morning. However, the ship encountered fog en route and was repeatedly delayed. It will not be able to sail to Shanghai until this morning. It will sail to Hong Kong at 5:45 p.m. today. Therefore, Yu and others must also postpone their departure until this afternoon. At that time, Mayor Wu and others will go to the ship to see them off.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills Fear Raw Material Shortage</h3>
<p>Inventory Less Than 50,000 Bags; Orders for Foreign Wheat May Be Reduced</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, last spring's wheat production in our country increased by about 30% compared to previous years, resulting in a temporary drop in wheat prices when new wheat was harvested. Taking advantage of the low prices, Japanese merchants bought large quantities in China. As domestic wheat inventories decreased, the flour and wheat market experienced unprecedented price increases in September and October last year. At that time, due to domestic stockpiling, there was a lack of precise statistics on the actual surplus or deficit. Since the spring of this year, the stockpiled goods in the interior have gradually been purchased by flour mills, and the inventory has become meager. Just in this city, the current stock of goods stored in various factories and grain stores is less than 50,000 bags, which is not enough for two months of use, according to the raw material needs of the factories' flour milling.</p>
<p>Ordering Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>Due to the relationship between gluten, the flour milled by various factories is mixed with domestic wheat and foreign wheat. Domestic wheat has soft fibers, so the yield is higher. Currently, various factories have limited domestic wheat stocks and are finding it difficult to purchase more. All the goods ordered at the end of last fall have been shipped to China in batches by the end of the year. This spring, the raw material shortage is even more acute. Another 18,000 tons of foreign wheat has been ordered. The first batch of 8,000 tons has been shipped to Shanghai, and the rest are being shipped in succession and will arrive in Shanghai around the 20th of this month. However, the market price of this foreign wheat is 30 to 40 cents higher per 100 catties (Sima catty) than domestic wheat. Due to the urgent need for raw materials, the remaining losses should also be taken into account.</p>
<p>Factories Reduce Production</p>
<p>Amidst the raw material shortage, flour mills are reducing production to maintain business operations. It is estimated that the number of operating machines is only 60% to 70%. If the situation continues until April and May, when the new wheat has not yet been harvested, it will inevitably lead to a complete shutdown. The wheat sown this year has been severely affected by unfavorable weather. According to speculation from people familiar with agricultural affairs, the domestic wheat production this year is likely to be reduced.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Tea Exports Increased</h3>
<p>Totaling Approximately 300,000 Quintals, An Increase of Over 6,000 Quintals Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry released the export and re-export volume of Chinese tea from Shanghai last year, with statistics based on anti-value. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Exports and Re-exports</p>
<p>Statistics for the export volume of Chinese tea (including green tea, black tea, brick tea, and other teas) from Shanghai last year (in quintals): United Kingdom 20,336.94, France 3,563.73, Germany 5,594.96, Netherlands 2,640.60, Spain 367.77, Denmark 322.05, Italy 2.77, Boston and other countries 371.77, United States 22,636.43, Canada 2,092.42, Africa 131,316.25, Soviet Union 5,058.23, India 5,248.17, Hong Kong 6,556.11, South Pacific Islands 70.42, Australia 413.96, and other countries 1,691.53, totaling 208,274.26. Adding the re-export volume, the total is 297,174.86, which is 6,851.95 more than the total export and re-export volume of 290,322.91 in the 24th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>Category and Value</p>
<p>The national export categories and values (in national currency) are as follows: Black tea 96,030 quintals, valued at 7,968,396 yuan; Green tea 155,931 quintals, valued at 19,192,267 yuan; Brick tea 90,876 quintals, valued at 2,305,565 yuan; Other teas 30,006 quintals, valued at 1,195,483 yuan; totaling 372,843 quintals, valued at 30,661,711 yuan.</p>
<h3>City Police Bureau Thoroughly Disinfects and Implements Random Checks on Reformed Opium Addicts</h3>
<p>Designating Two Thousand People, Ordering All Bureaus and Offices to Summon for Inspection; Changing Fourth-Term Licenses Starting April 1st</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, in order to prevent reformed opium addicts from relapsing and to thoroughly eliminate opium addiction, the City Police Bureau is processing the summons and inspection of reformed opium addicts. According to Dai Lizhen, the head of the Opium Suppression Section, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Issuing Orders to Summon Reformed Opium Addicts for Inspection</p>
<p>The bureau has registered opium addicts and reported the number of registered opium addicts, totaling over 42,000 people, of which over 18,000 have voluntarily quit. However, last year, various sub-bureaus discovered over 220 opium addicts who had relapsed after quitting. After interrogation by the bureau's Third Section, they were transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for imprisonment. In order to prevent opium addicts from being indecisive and relapsing, the bureau, with the approval of the municipal government, ordered the 16th Pu West Gate Sub-Bureaus to summon reformed opium addicts for inspection last month. In order to thoroughly eliminate opium addiction, 2,000 reformed opium addicts were designated a few days ago, and the list was announced to all police sub-bureaus and police stations, ordering them to summon them for inspection. After the 2,000 opium addicts have been summoned for inspection, they will be summoned in batches to ensure that reformed opium addicts do not relapse and fall into the legal net.</p>
<p>This Year's Seized Opium Cases</p>
<p>Since the end of the opium addict registration at the end of last December, the bureau has issued orders to all bureaus and offices to step up the investigation and arrest of unregistered opium addicts and drug dealers. As of yesterday, 48 drug cases have been seized, and 84 opium addicts have been arrested. After interrogation by the bureau's Third Section, they were transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for trial under military law. The drug dealers will be interrogated by the headquarters and then requested for approval from the Military Affairs Commission for immediate execution by shooting, in order to deter others.</p>
<p>Opium Addicts' Licenses to Be Renewed Next Month</p>
<p>According to the regulations, opium addicts' licenses in this city are renewed every six months. The third-term licenses expired on October 1st of last year and will expire on the 30th of this month. The Opium Suppression Section of the bureau is actively processing the fourth-term licenses, which will begin to be renewed on April 1st. At that time, a full registration will be announced first, and opium addicts will go to renew their licenses.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Electric Power Company's Profits Last Year</h3>
<p>12,454,575 Yuan</p>
<p>According to the 1936 annual report released by the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the company made every effort to increase all types of business last year. Although the business situation in the first half of the year was not good, there were still many new subscribers. As a result of this effort, despite the continued sluggishness of most construction activities throughout the year, the number of users still increased by 2,229. At the end of last year, there were a total of 78,934 users. The kilowatt units sold increased by 5% compared to 1935, so the annual settlement showed a very good business performance. The expenses required for the company's expansion and improvement can all be paid from the profits without the need to raise new funds. The reserve fund listed on the balance sheet totals 9,438,878 yuan, an increase of 1,590,291 yuan compared to the end of 1935. The company's income, as of the end of last year, after deducting expenses and other items, showed a profit of 12,454,575 yuan. The company's assets are valued at 177,830,215 yuan. The operating income totaled 25,566,730 yuan, the operating expenses totaled 12,834,516 yuan, and the net profit was 12,731,214 yuan. In addition, the interest and dividends from the Shanghai West District Electric Power Company totaled 172,062 yuan. The dividends for the silver preferred shares are still paid quarterly as usual. The dividends for the second preferred shares of US$7 per share have been fully paid.</p>
<h3>Capital of Various Industries Allowed to Submit Supplementary Income Tax Declarations</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Invites Representatives of Various Industries to Talk Today</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Finance is implementing income tax, and with the assistance of the City Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Industries Association, the promotion is proceeding smoothly. The capital declarations for business income tax were closed at the end of last month. The Shanghai office is currently reviewing them and will report them to the head office in the coming days. However, there are still some businesses and companies that do not understand the filing procedures and meaning and have not filed. The City Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to convene representatives of various industry associations throughout the city this afternoon to discuss. At that time, Liang Hejun, director of the Shanghai office, and others will attend to explain in detail. It is reported that in order to facilitate merchants, supplementary declarations are allowed. According to the staff of the office, income tax is a good tax, and the procedures must be changed from the previous malpractices. A more generous attitude should be adopted to achieve the initial intention of not harassing merchants. It is hoped that merchants can trust the government to facilitate the promotion. It is also reported that charitable organizations or the foundations and educational savings of groups that are stipulated to be tax-exempt are now also starting to be declared, with the deadline at the end of this month. However, in order to prevent abuses, more detailed regulations will be added. The former must be legal charitable organizations or groups designated as funds for certain purposes and not used at any time. The latter must be savings for children's education, and receipts from school fee payments must be used as proof when receiving the principal and interest. Otherwise, the interest income will be taxed at the ordinary deposit interest rate. In addition, the office will earnestly handle the tax refunds for overpaid taxes. After calculating the tax payment lists from all parties, about twenty cases have been discovered, most of which are due to miscalculations by the taxpaying institutions. Although the amounts are very scattered, they have all been reviewed, listed, and registered. Once the tax refund method is agreed upon, the taxpaying institutions will be notified to collect the refunds. The procedures will also be simplified.</p>
<h3>Jade Exhibition for Paris Exposition Opens Today</h3>
<p>Inviting Military and Political Authorities and Leaders from All Sectors to Visit</p>
<p>Our country's exhibits for this year's Paris International Exposition have been very enthusiastic. Among them, the jade industry's exhibits are the most precious, including a jade pagoda that took ten years of carving and 150,000 man-hours to complete. Its value is inestimable. In addition, there are large quantities of jade carvings and various precious jewelry, a dazzling array of beautiful things. They are displayed separately for public exhibition.

<h3>Workers at British Tram Company's Machine Room Went on Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>Seven Demands Rejected by Management; Representatives to Petition Party and Government Agencies This Morning</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, Zhang Shunbao and Zhang Shiqing, two steelworkers at the Herd Road Old Factory of the British Shanghai Tram Company in the Public Concession, had requested three days of leave from the company, but they had not returned to work after the expiration of the leave. They returned to the factory on the 27th of last month. The company fired them on the grounds that the workers had not applied for an extension of their leave after the leave expired. The factory workers expressed dissatisfaction upon hearing the news and negotiated with the company, but to no avail. Therefore, a go-slow occurred on the evening of the 27th. The company sent people to persuade them and promised to reply on the afternoon of the 3rd. By the day before yesterday, the company still had not given a definite reply. At about 10 p.m., all 80-odd workers expressed dissatisfaction and went on strike. All 80-odd workers at the Huishan Road factory also followed suit, and the situation was quite serious.</p>
<p>Joint Strike</p>
<p>Since the 160-odd workers in the machine room and coppersmith room of the old and new factories in Herd Road and Huishan Road went on strike, at about 7 a.m. yesterday, the workers in Huishan Road flocked to the main factory on Baikai'er Road, demanding that all workers join the strike. Upon hearing the news, the Western manager of the factory persuaded the workers and promised to reply at 4 p.m. However, the factory still did not reply at that time, so all the workers poured out of the factory and joined the strike. Currently, the striking workers include 86 from the Herd Road factory, 86 from the Huishan Road factory, and over 300 workers from various rooms at the Baikai'er Road factory, totaling about 500 people.</p>
<p>Obstructing Tram Operation</p>
<p>After the workers in the two factories in the eastern district of Shanghai joined the strike, the Yulin Road police station in charge dispatched over 100 Chinese and Western detectives and several police cars to guard the area. At about 4 p.m., when a tram on the 8th route on Yangshupu Road was running, more than 30 workers went to stop it. Two workers were arrested by the detectives. Then, at the Pingliang Road intersection, many workers went to question the detectives upon hearing the news. The detectives, fearing an accident, released the workers immediately. There have been no other disturbances, but the police station is on high alert.</p>
<p>Presenting Conditions</p>
<p>After the workers of the three factories went on strike, they presented seven conditions, as follows: (1) The two workers who were unreasonably dismissed should be reinstated immediately. (2) For every year of service, a month's severance pay should be given, and so on. For those who have not completed one year, it should be calculated at 12%. (3) Whether the factory closes down or the workers resign, all severance pay should be paid. (4) If a worker dies or is injured on the job and cannot work, in addition to the severance pay he is entitled to, special condolence money should be given. (5) Severance pay should be given for five years of service, regardless of whether the worker resigns or retires. (6) If a worker takes sick leave with a doctor's certificate, his salary should be paid. (7) Work should be stopped on Sundays, and salaries should be paid.</p>
<p>Negotiations Failed</p>
<p>At 4 p.m., the workers of the three factories sent foremen Ge Wenpei, Shu Changlin, Chen Pinhai, Zhu Xiaogen, Xu Renhai, Tian Axiang, Zhou Shenglin, and Lu Sanbao to the general office on North Suzhou River to meet with Park Locke, the tram manager, to negotiate, but they were rejected, resulting in no outcome. The foremen held a meeting last night to discuss how to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>Petition This Morning</p>
<p>The workers decided at the meeting last night to send 12 representatives to the City Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the General Labor Union, and other agencies this morning to petition for assistance and mediation in order to prevent the labor unrest from escalating.</p>
<p>Not Escalating</p>
<p>A Da Gong News Agency reporter inquired about the opinions of representatives of the ticket sellers and drivers on this labor unrest yesterday. According to them, the labor unrest of the ticket sellers and drivers had been resolved by the party and government agencies, but they hoped that the company would implement the agreed-upon measures uniformly and not make excuses to obstruct them. They also said that ticket seller No. 243, due to his weak health, was unable to work and had requested the company to retire and issue severance pay. Who knew that the company authorities replied that the severance pay would be implemented from February 1, 1937, and that the previous years of work could not be included. Therefore, the workers are very panicked and have requested the party and government agencies to negotiate. As for the labor unrest of the three factories, it is hoped that the company will accept their demands so that the labor unrest can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Yu Jie-cai Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Successful Petition Results</h3>
<p>Yesterday, issues regarding education for Yi and Miao youths were discussed; a proposal to establish an organization to promote Yi and Miao affairs</p>
<p>A large group of Tusi to come to Beijing and Shanghai in six months</p>
<p>Gao Yuzhu and Yu Jie-cai, representatives of the Tusi and people of the southwestern Yi ethnic group along the border, previously expressed the genuine desire of the Tusi and Miao people to petition the central government in Beijing regarding opinions on managing national defense for the southwestern ethnic groups. After three months, Gao and Yu are soon to return south. Mr. Yu made a special trip to Shanghai the day before yesterday to connect with various sectors. After the matter was completed, he went to Beijing again this afternoon. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency specially visited Mr. Yu at his residence yesterday to inquire about the details.</p>
<p>Good results from petitioning in Beijing</p>
<p>According to Mr. Yu, the key points of the petition to the Third Plenary Session by Gao and Yu included: ㊀ Investigation methods for Yi affairs, ㊁ Education methods, ㊂ Governance methods, ㊃ Development methods, ㊄ Requesting special provisions for the election of Yi and Miao representatives to the National Assembly, so that the Yi and Miao peoples can produce formal representatives and have the opportunity to participate in national politics, achieving the principle of equality; ㊅ Treatment of representatives of the Yi and Miao Tusi and people along the southwestern border, etc. The central government paid close attention to this, approved many items, and handed them over to the Executive Yuan for planning and implementation. At the same time, forms were printed for the petitioners to conduct detailed investigations to facilitate progress. Because the government cares about border affairs, the results of the petition were extremely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Local associations assist students</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Mr. Yu went to the city center to visit Mayor Wu, and then visited educator Huang Yanpei at the local association to discuss future education for Yi Tusi youths coming to Shanghai to facilitate cultural exchange and fulfill the purpose of developing education in the border regions. The local association is very enthusiastic about assisting Miao and Yi youths in coming to Shanghai for education. Students coming to Shanghai in the future will be accommodated by the local association, and efforts will be made to waive all expenses. After Gao and Yu return to Yunnan, they will begin sending Miao and Yi Tusi youths to Shanghai to study in batches.</p>
<p>Setting up a Miao-Yi Promotion Association in Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Yu will go to Beijing this afternoon, and within a day or two, will come to Shanghai with Gao Yuzhu. According to them, after Mr. Gao arrives, the biggest task will be to prepare for the establishment of a fixed organization in Shanghai to promote Yi and Miao culture and publish periodicals. They will ask for assistance from all sectors in this matter. Other tasks include: ㊀ Continuing to visit schools, factories, etc. in Shanghai that have not yet been visited; ㊁ Preparing for public lectures to give concrete reports on all aspects of Miao and Yi culture, geography, and social conditions; ㊂ Seeking to promote the deep attention of domestic compatriots to the Miao and Yi peoples, and expressing gratitude to all sectors.</p>
<p>Returning to Beijing and Shanghai in six months</p>
<p>After another ten days of staying in Beijing and Shanghai, Gao and Yu will return to the Yunnan border to promote the central government's benevolence and conduct investigations into the Yi and Miao situation according to the central government's instructions to seek common unity among the Tusi. At the same time, they will go to the border areas of Sichuan and Guizhou to understand the actual situation and collect local products. Six months later, they plan to come to Beijing and Shanghai again. At that time, in addition to submitting the investigation report to the central government, they will bring local products to hold a border area product exhibition in Beijing and Shanghai. They will also lead a large group of Miao and Yi Tusi to visit Beijing and Shanghai, and a large group of Miao and Yi youths to come to Shanghai to study.</p>
<h3>Outgoing Commander of the US Fleet Orem Returned Home Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Orem, the outgoing commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, departed for his home country yesterday at 5:00 PM aboard the Dollar Steamship Company's President Wilson liner, after Rear Admiral Marquette, the newly appointed commander, arrived in Shanghai to take over. He will be assigned to a new position.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Route to Return to Normal Starting Today</h3>
<p>Customs lifts ban on waterways, six companies cancel shallow water fees</p>
<p>Last year in September and October, the river water had already receded. When the water level was at its lowest, the Jiujiang-Hankou section receded to nine feet and one inch. Large ships from the six Shanghai companies could only reach Wuhu, and medium-sized ships could only reach Jiujiang. Freight transportation between Xun and Han was changed to barge transshipment. Above Yuezhou on the Hankou-Changsha line, the water level even dropped to one foot, and navigation was completely suspended. All cargo was transported by local boats. The Sichuan River route was also divided into three linked sections, causing major difficulties for Yangtze River shipping. The Jianghan Customs temporarily closed the original river channel and sought a new route to maintain transportation for five months. Until recently, due to the warm weather, the water level in the Yangtze River has risen sharply.</p>
<p>Water Level Rises Significantly</p>
<p>Yesterday, various shipping companies in this port received a telegram from Hankou stating that the shallowest point in the upper reaches has risen to more than eighteen feet, and all difficult navigation points between Jiujiang and Hankou are unobstructed. Large ships can pass directly to Hankou with heavy loads. Ships carrying rice, salt, iron, coal, and deep-draft seagoing vessels can also travel up and down without hindrance. Terry, the Superintendent of the Jianghan Customs Inspection Department, sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday stating that the sections of the waterway closed during the shallow water period will be reopened for navigation on the 5th of this month (i.e., today). The shallowest waterways,</p>
<p>Is Daijia Island</p>
<p>And Luohu Island. When the water was shallow last winter, the Jianghan Customs closed these two waterways, restricting the passage of Yangtze River ships traveling up and down, and set up red and black flag buoys there as warning signs for ships. The lightship in the eastern channel of Daijia Island was stopped from emitting light, and the lightship below Luohu Island also turned off its lights to indicate that this route was impassable. To prevent accidents, the Fankou small steamer was specially dispatched to serve as a guard in that section. Now that the river water has risen sharply, the</p>
<p>Navigation Route Restored</p>
<p>For traffic will be implemented from today. The red and black flag buoys on Daijia Island will be removed, and the lightship in the eastern channel of that area and the Luohu Island lightship will resume emitting light as usual from today, indicating that ships can resume navigation. The Fanjiang small steamer will also be withdrawn from today. All changes to the Yangtze River route during the shallow water period will be restored to their original state today. Lest the shipping companies be unaware, this is telegraphed in detail for notification to avoid misunderstandings. The six companies in this port</p>
<p>Further Agreed</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the Yangtze River water has risen greatly and there are no restrictions on the movement of ships and the loading of goods, the shallow water freight increase agreed upon last year during the shallow water period will be cancelled uniformly from the 10th of this month. The Yangtze River section will be reduced by 50 percent, and the Changsha route will be reduced by 100 percent. It was previously discussed to shorten the reduction when the water rose. Now that it has been discussed and decided, the shallow water fee added last year will be cancelled uniformly from the 10th of this month, restoring the original rate from five months ago. However, due to the sharp increase in various expenses on the ship, after the shallow water fee is cancelled, the freight rate will be moderately increased by 20 percent as compensation. An announcement will be made to all passengers soon.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Pan Shi-wu Returns to China, Arrives in Shanghai for Investment</h3>

Mr. Pan has affairs to attend to in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, so he is scheduled to take the President McKinley liner to Guangzhou this morning. He plans to stay for a week and then come to Shanghai again to meet with leaders of the local industrial sector and conduct investment matters.</p>
<h3>Caohejing Local Commemoration Today</h3>
<p>Lights and candles shine brightly in the evening</p>
<p>Today (the 5th) is the beginning of the 13th annual local commemoration of Caohejing Town. More than 50 merchants and residents of the town, including Tang Puzhuang, Pan Wenlan, and Xue Linsheng, held a preparatory meeting at the Yang residence. He Jingzhi and Tang Jimin were appointed to be responsible for the arrangements. It was decided by public consensus to abolish meaningless colored archways. In order to promote business, a reed mat shed was erected at the Guanshengyuan Workers' Sports Ground to set up a market, allowing merchants to set up temporary stalls. It is reported that many people registered for the meeting in the past two days. All arrangements have now been completed. Tonight, the lights and candles in front of the shops will be brilliant and will be worth seeing. It is also understood that members of the Sincere Society will hold a dinner party.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Promotes Tea Industry Production Inspection</h3>
<p>Fan Hejun dispatched to Fujian for inspection</p>
<p>In order to revive the tea industry and improve the quality of Chinese tea, the Ministry of Industry established the Tea Production Inspection and Supervision Office this spring. It is now learned that the area for production inspection implemented by the office this year was originally set for the provinces of Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi. However, the tea production in Fujian is also quite important. The Provincial Department of Construction has repeatedly requested the Ministry of Industry to hold it at the same time. It is now learned that Fan Hejun, the head of the inspection section of the Supervision Office, has been dispatched to Fujian Province to inspect the tea industry and prepare for production inspection. It is reported that Mr. Fan took a boat yesterday afternoon to the first place.</p>
<h3>Notice from the Tenant Association</h3>
<p>Refusing to pay house tax for road construction beyond the concession</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Tenant Association of this city believes that the forced collection of house tax by the Public Works Department in the road construction area beyond the concession concerns the infringement of Chinese sovereignty. In addition to requesting the municipal government to negotiate the recovery of self-management, it specially notified tenants in the area yesterday to refuse to pay the tax unanimously. The road construction beyond the concession is an illegal act by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession that infringes upon Chinese sovereignty. The various sectors have long advocated for recovery. However, the Bureau is determined to persist, and although negotiations have been held repeatedly, no thorough solution has been obtained. Now the Public Works Department is intensifying its efforts and is willing to use various coercive methods to force the collection of house tax, which is extremely indignant. The owners have now expressed their opposition, and all of our tenants should also deeply recognize that the road construction area beyond the concession should legally be managed by the municipal government. If we rashly pay the tax, it is tantamount to making a cocoon and helping to create the infringement fact. The Association cannot bear to sit idly by. In addition to submitting a request to the municipal government to quickly negotiate recovery for self-management, a special notice is hereby issued to all tenants that they must take consistent steps and persist to the end, and emphasize national integrity to maintain sovereignty. This notice is hereby issued.</p>

<h3>Inland River Shipping Industry Supports New Minister of Communications Yu</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the Central Political Conference approved the special appointment of Yu Feipeng as Minister of Communications, personnel in the communications sector in Shanghai have expressed unusual excitement. According to Mr. Wang Jianping, Director-General of the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Industry Association, since Mr. Yu has been acting as Minister of Communications, he has been keenly reforming the postal, telecommunications, and aviation industries, with remarkable achievements. Among them, the three matters of establishing shipping industry registration, shipping industry supervision, and promoting shipping industry cooperation are the most satisfactory to the public. The Association resolved at the Sixth Member Congress on December 26 last year to telegraph the Executive Yuan requesting that Mr. Yu be formally appointed as Minister of Communications to recognize his contributions. Now that the clear order has been issued, the public is greatly comforted. Communications is an important national policy and is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. Moreover, during this extraordinary period, the responsibility is even greater.

<h3>Mint Purchases Eight Nickel-Copper Coin Machines from the US</h3>
<p>Increasing the production of new subsidiary coins, expected to arrive in Shanghai in early next month</p>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, since the implementation of the legal tender policy in our country two years ago, in order to unify the currency system, the Ministry of Finance's Central Mint was ordered to mint one-cent and half-cent copper coins, as well as five-cent, one-dime, and two-dime nickel-based new subsidiary coins, which began to circulate in the market in February last year. Now, due to the convenience of use, the demand from all over the country is increasing day by day, resulting in a situation where the daily output of new coins is insufficient for distribution. Therefore, there is a recent plan to add machinery to increase the daily output of nickel coins to one million pieces to meet demand. Eight coin minting machines were specially purchased from the United States, with four machines dedicated to minting one-cent and half-cent copper coins, and four machines dedicated to minting one-dime and two-dime nickel coins. The machinery has been purchased by the Central Mint from the United States and will soon be shipped from the United States to China. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early next month and will be installed and completed in May to start minting. The factory authorities believe that after the new machines are added, the factory premises will be insufficient, so a new factory building has been located to the left of the original factory site, costing approximately 20,000 yuan, and construction has begun. It will soon be completed to house the newly purchased coin minting machinery. After the new machines arrive, the factory will have a total of 25 machines. Based on the total production rate of the existing 17 machines, it can produce 18,750,000 to 18,800,000 one-cent and half-cent copper coins, and 20 to 25 percent nickel coins per day.</p>

He presented a brief table listing local public opinions to the province for review. He cited the provincial government's financial order No. 1747 and land order No. 14, which stated that the city land and special land, and the portion of the land price that was in dispute, should be forwarded to the land administration bureau for handling according to law. He expressed the hope that all those present would express their opinions on this new policy so that it could be fully benefited from, and so on.

Then, Yao Huiquan expressed his opinion, hoping to reduce the standard price and increase the tax rate in accordance with the actual situation. Then, Zhang Yi spoke, stating that land policy is one of the methods by which the Premier solved the problem of people's livelihood. The county's trial implementation was at the forefront, creating a great political record, which was deeply admired. However, during the initial valuation, the interviews may not have been thorough, and the investigations may not have been factual, resulting in unfairness and disputes. The provincial government took into account the people's feelings and provided the convenience of revising the standard price of city land and special land. He hoped that the revaluation of land prices must be handled appropriately so that the public would be convinced, the new policy could be promoted to its full benefit, and the land policy could be realized.

<h3>Death Sentence for Li Zhibao, Manufacturer of Narcotics</h3>
<p>Second Special Court Pronounces Death Penalty as a Beginning</p>
<p>Since our country implemented the Provisional Regulations for Punishing the Crimes of Prohibiting Opium and Narcotics, more than a year has passed. Generally, the manufacturing and selling of potent narcotics are punishable by death. However, from January 1st of this year, those who consume narcotics are also subject to the death penalty. The authorities have repeatedly issued announcements to inform the public. Recently, Chinese detectives Xu Zhiqing and Wu Changkai from the Xinzha Patrol Room uncovered Jiangbei native Li Zhibao and his concubine Chen Huangshi, who were privately manufacturing red pills in a pavilion room on the upper floor of No. 73, Lane 432, Meibai Road. They confiscated a large quantity of red pills and manufacturing equipment. They were sent to the First Special Court, and the Patrol Room's lawyer, Li Zhishan, prosecuted them according to Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing the Crimes of Narcotics. The defendant Li Zhibao confessed that he was instructed to manufacture the drugs by Wu A'er, who is at large, while Chen Huangshi denied the charges. The court heard the cases and awaited the pronouncements. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin presided over the case in Criminal Court No. 8 and announced the verdict. The main text of the verdict stated that Li Zhibao was sentenced to death for jointly manufacturing narcotics and deprived of his civil rights for life. Chen Huangshi was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment for jointly manufacturing narcotics, with the sentence reduced, and deprived of her civil rights for ten years. All confiscated items were to be confiscated according to the list. If they were not satisfied with the verdict, they could file an appeal with the Second High Branch Court within ten days of receiving the verdict.

<h3>A Woman Crushed into Multiple Pieces on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Tracks</h3>
<p>Resembling Suicide, Body Separated into More Than Ten Sections, The Flesh Was Gruesome and Unbearable to Witness</p>
<p>Around 10 p.m. the night before last, a patrol team from the Zhabei Security Corps discovered a human head on the railway tracks between Gonghe Xin Road and Datong Road. Upon inspection, it was determined to be that of a female, with her hair cut off. Further inspection revealed multiple sections of the body, including the torso, legs, and feet, scattered along the second track (belonging to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway) for more than ten zhang (approximately 33 meters). The patrol team immediately reported the discovery to the railway police, who in turn notified the section chief of the railway. Upon arrival and investigation, it was determined that the victim had been struck and killed by a high-speed train at 10:15 p.m. The railway police then summoned the local bailiff, Shen Xiaowu, to collect the severed limbs, head, and torso and place them together to prevent further damage by passing trains. Yesterday morning, the bailiff reported the incident to the Shanghai Local Court. Around 4 p.m., Prosecutor Li Fen, accompanied by a female coroner, arrived at the scene for an inquest. The victim's skull was crushed, and the brain matter had flowed out. Both hands and fingers were also crushed. The abdomen and intestines were exposed. One foot was severed from the knee. She was barefoot, with a pair of leather shoes lying separately. A pair of yellow-black striped socks were also separated from her feet. She was wearing a tobacco-colored silk spring cat-skin cheongsam, with a single blue Shilin cloth long coat and a striped cloth short shirt underneath, and black trousers. She appeared to be around thirty years old. During the inquest, a green gemstone ring was still on the victim's finger, which the prosecutor took for safekeeping. Judging by the circumstances, it appeared to be a suicide. The body was separated into about ten sections, and the flesh was gruesome and unbearable to witness. Since no family members could be found, the prosecutor filled out the coroner's report and instructed the bailiff to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Zhang Youli, a 35-year-old Jiangbei native who resides at No. 16, Shuncheng Lane, Zhoujia Pai Road, selling steamed buns, is still single. Sun Xiuying, a 17-year-old girl from Taizhou, lives in the same two-story building. She is somewhat attractive and works at the Yufeng Textile Factory. Zhang Youli often teases her, but she ignores him. On the morning of the 22nd of last month, at around 10 a.m., because she was working the night shift, she was asleep in bed. Zhang Youli took advantage of the fact that her mother, Mrs. Ding, had gone out to the vegetable market to buy vegetables. He secretly climbed up to the second floor, pinned down Sun Xiuying, and attempted to violate her. At that moment, his mother returned from the vegetable market, and the girl told her the truth. His mother scolded him, but he became angry and started yelling loudly. He then violently pushed his mother and the girl to the ground and prevented Sun Xiuying from going to work at the factory. He used a knife to cut the girl's face, causing injuries. Chinese detective Zhang Yunjian heard the commotion and arrived, arrested Zhang Youli, and sent him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Bianfen continued the trial in Criminal Court No. 3. The Municipal Council lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, filed a public prosecution under Article 222, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code for attempted rape and stated that the defendant was overcome by lust and desired to achieve his goal like a beast. He even assaulted his mother for scolding him. He requested severe punishment. When questioned, the defendant's confession was evasive. Judge Xiao ordered him to be remanded in custody and scheduled the sentencing for a later date.</p>

<h3>The Wife of the Street Sweeper in Shangxian Lane, Autopsy Reveals Death Due to Illness</h3>
<p>The Deceased and the Lodger Repeatedly Caused Trouble, She Was Detained by the Police and Died from the Stress</p>
<p>The Yu family, a landlord residing at No. 32, Shangxian Lane, Lane 358, Xiafei Road in the French Concession, moved out after being sued by the landlord for owing rent. On the 17th of last month, Yang Wu, a 27-year-old woman from Nanjing who was renting a room downstairs, dismantled the loft boards installed by the landlord for sale while moving. Cao A'er, a city resident who swept the streets in the lane, stopped her from dismantling. Cao's wife, Zhou, rushed over to help, leading to a dispute and mutual struggle at the police station. As a result, Yang Wu was still allowed to dismantle the boards. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 3 p.m., Yang Wu went to Cao to ask for the key to open the door and take the iron bed. Cao's wife, Cao Zhou, again had a verbal dispute with Yang Wu. Wu reported it to the police, who summoned Zhou for questioning. Because Zhou was being unreasonable, they decided to detain her. At 9 p.m., she was released and returned home. Zhou immediately felt pain in her chest. Cao A'er sent her to Jianan Hospital at No. 17, Laozhen Father Road for treatment. Zhou was already in her last breath and eventually died due to ineffective treatment in half an hour. The hospital reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. The deceased's husband, Cao A'er, claimed that his wife had been beaten by Yang Wu on the 27th of last month and verbally abused on this day, which led to her detention and death. The police then transported the body to the Tongren Auxiliary Hall Mortuary. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the First Special Court, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived at the mortuary at noon to examine the body. No injuries were found on the body. Then, in the afternoon, the body was dissected for a detailed examination. The results showed that the deceased had a history of asthma and heart failure and died from stress. After the examination, the official allowed the husband of the deceased to sign an affidavit to claim the body for burial. However, the deceased's husband was unwilling to accept this and hired a lawyer to prepare for a legal resolution with Yang Wu.</p>
<h3>The Cook's Son Extorts a Huge Sum</h3>
<p>The Son Inherits His Father's Profession and Then Starts Extorting Money, The Son Makes Unreasonable Demands and Continues to Extort</p>
<p>The cook at No. 159 Hankou Road, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, was originally a Ningbo native surnamed Chen. Chen had hired Wang Aru as an assistant. After Chen passed away due to illness, Wang took over the position. However, Chen's son, Chen Defu (currently 23 years old), would frequently demand money from Wang. Wang would often provide assistance, giving him one yuan or several jiao each time. On the 28th of last month, Wang Aru suddenly received a threatening letter from Chen Defu, intending to extort</p>
<p>Fifty yuan</p>
<p>Wang ignored it. Then, on the 1st of this month, he received another letter stating that if he did not pay, he would be met with knives and axes. Wang reported this to the General Patrol Room. Wang would go to the Fuzhou Road vegetable market around 8 a.m. every day to buy vegetables. On the 2nd of the month, his son, Wang Hanzhang, went to buy the vegetables instead. Chen Defu was already waiting inside the vegetable market. When he saw Wang Hanzhang, he stepped forward, first threatening him verbally and then taking out</p>
<p>An ax and a hammer each</p>
<p>Intending to harm Wang's life. Wang quickly avoided him and escaped. Afterwards, Wang Aru notified the police. At 8 a.m. the day before yesterday, Chinese detective Li Wenhan accompanied Wang Aru to the vegetable market. Chen came again and was arrested by the detective and taken back to the police station. According to his confession, the threatening letter was written in collaboration with someone named Wang Shaoan, and the ax and hammer were borrowed from</p>
<p>Song Xiaochun</p>
<p>At Zhou Runxing's plank box shop at No. 9, Lane 140, Shandong Road. The detectives then, together with personnel from the Municipal Police Department, arrested Wang Shaoan at No. 224 Xinjiang Road and temporarily detained him at the Municipal Police Department. They then went to Zhou Runxing's shop and retrieved the ax and hammer. Yesterday morning, Chen Defu was transferred to Criminal Court No. 1 of the First Court. The Patrol Room lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the circumstances and filed a lawsuit for the crime of extortion. He stated that Wang Shaoan had not yet been brought to the police station, so he requested</p>
<p>Adjournment for Hearing</p>
<p>Wang Aru then testified about the events, stating that he had provided the defendant with about two hundred yuan in assistance before. When questioned, Chen Defu confessed that the plaintiff was originally a partner of his father. After his father passed away, he had taken over the job for half a month, but then the plaintiff took it away. Although he had given him a considerable amount of money, it was all paid separately. The threatening letter was written by him, and so on. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the criminal court, reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for another week of interrogation.</p>

<h3>Paramount Hotel Coordination Plan Not Approved by the Court</h3>
<p>Due to Objections from Creditors, A Meeting of Creditors is Scheduled for the 13th</p>
<p>Since the Paramount Hotel closed down last year due to heavy debts that could not be repaid, the Dacheng Company applied to the First Special District Local Court for bankruptcy, which was accepted and ruled by the court. Accountant An Shaoyun was appointed as the bankruptcy administrator. The first creditors' meeting was convened in December of last year, and the debtor's proposed coordination plan was passed on the spot. However, just as the bankruptcy administrator was reporting to the court for approval, a portion of the creditors (foreigners) raised objections, claiming that they had not participated in the creditors' meeting. Therefore, the court, in accordance with the law, did not approve the coordination plan and approved the administrator's request to convene a second creditors' meeting on the 13th of this month to proceed with the bankruptcy process. The court's announcement is as follows: Regarding the announcement, this court is handling Bankruptcy Case No. 24 of the 25th year of the Republic (1936) of Dacheng Co., Ltd. (Paramount Hotel).

<h3>Serial Offender and Persistent Thief Horita Arrested</h3>
<p>The Japanese Consulate General Deploys a Wide Search Network, Requests Assistance from the Municipal Council's Japanese Police, and Finally Arrests Him on Hong Kong Road</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, since January, extortion and robbery cases have frequently occurred in the Japanese district of Hongkou, causing great panic among ordinary families. The Japanese Consul General's Police Department has devoted all its efforts to searching for the perpetrator. On the afternoon of the 3rd, at 4:45 p.m., Horita Masao, 31 years old, from Kumamoto City, was purchasing a ticket at the Guanglu Theater on Zhapu Road Bridge and was about to enter to</p>
<p>Watch a Movie</p>
<p>When he was spotted by the Hankou Police Station. The perpetrator immediately fled and was only arrested on Hong Kong Road after being chased. The perpetrator claimed to be Korean and resisted on the spot. He was then assisted by Chinese police and brought to the Consul General's office. It was found that the perpetrator had served as a diplomat for Rong Shang Zeng on Zhapu Road in April of last year, but was dismissed after only a month. He was later arrested for fraud and imprisoned in Nagasaki Prison. He completed his sentence in January of this year and</p>
<p>Came to Shanghai Again</p>
<p>He knows the situation of Japanese families well and has repeatedly extorted money from Japanese people. On the 10th night of January, he stole 50 to 60 yuan from the Yisong restaurant on North Sichuan Road. On February 17th, he broke into the Yajima family in Hengfeng Lane, Shigaota Road, threatened the housekeeper with a kitchen knife, and stole a sewing machine. On the 22nd of the same month, he claimed to be a Municipal Council patrol officer and broke into the Okamoto family on Hesserk Road, stealing items worth more than 100 yuan. On the 2nd of this month, he</p>
<p>Demanded Travel Expenses</p>
<p>At Fumin Hospital. The perpetrator often stayed in Chinese hotels and often disguised himself, so the police at the Consul General's office had not been able to track him down. They had been searching in various ways for a month but had made no progress. On the 28th night of the previous month, he was seen wandering near the racecourse on Great Horse Road and escaped again. Director Tajima and other judicial personnel held a search meeting and deployed a wide search network, but due to insufficient manpower, they requested assistance from the Japanese team police of the Municipal Council before he could be captured.</p>
<h3>Wall Collapses on Edward Road (Avenue Edward VII) in Madrid Last Night</h3>
<p>Vegetable Vendor Wang Liansheng Was Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Numbers 1126, 1128 and 1130 Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession, are all single, two-story buildings, originally part of the New Madrid buildings (opposite Rue Montauban [now Route des Soeurs] in the French Concession). They were constructed more than twenty years ago. Unexpectedly, at 11:30 last night, the rear extension of the Haichangxing Sheepskin Shop (established for 15 years), opened by Hai Shanzhong, a Henan native, at No. 1128, together with the upper half of the rear wall, suddenly collapsed completely with a loud crash that shook the surrounding area. At the same time, the rear walls of the neighboring houses, No. 1126, Gu Shunxing's Awning Shop, and No. 1130, Xu Yongtai's Paint Shop, also collapsed partially. When the wall collapsed, Wang Liansheng (37 years old), a vegetable vendor from Jiangbei who resided at No. 17 Annakin Road in the French Concession, happened to be urinating next to a trash can at the base of the wall and was injured in the head and feet. The nearby patrol officers immediately telegraphed the police station, and the fire brigade dispatched an ambulance to take Wang Liansheng to Renji Hospital for treatment. The detectives were ordered to investigate the cause of the collapse for verification.</p>

<h3>Tax School Student Poisons Himself</h3>
<p>Li Honggu, a 22-year-old Cantonese student from the Tax School at No. 200 Rue P. Heude (now Route Tenant de la Tour) in the French Concession, for unknown reasons, secretly took poison at around 9 a.m. yesterday. Soon after, the poison took effect and he became uncontrollable.

<h3>Hengli River Works: County Government Urges Completion of Dredging</h3>
<p>District Office Summons Baojia for Discussion</p>
<p>The Shanghai County's requisition of labor to dredge the Hengli River works, including the construction of dams to pump water and engage in manual dredging, has been hampered by continuous rain, leading to slow progress. The Shanghai County Government issued Instruction No. 2265 yesterday, stating that the Hengli River channel in the county is of utmost importance for water conservancy and transportation within the county. Local individuals reported that the river had been neglected for years, resulting in increasing siltation. With the approval of this office and endorsement, funds were allocated from the provincial relief fund surplus and funds were raised to implement dredging this year. However, it has been found that more than two months have passed since the commencement of work, and the amount of excavated soil is minimal. The spring plowing season is approaching quickly, and the completion of the project is uncertain, which is a matter of grave concern. All villagers along the river must understand that the dredging of the Hengli River is primarily for irrigation of fields and convenience of transportation. Although no wages are paid for soil excavation, the construction of dams, water pumping, and equipment management involve public funds, which are substantial. It is imperative to take advantage of the current agricultural off-season to work together diligently to complete the project, and no one should use excuses to delay or postpone the work. In the future, before the river is dredged to the specified width and depth, no dams may be opened to divert water, and the work funds received by each district office will not be reimbursed. In addition to issuing separate orders to the respective district chiefs to supervise the work strictly, this announcement is hereby issued, urging all conscripted laborers along the river to consider the vital interests of the river and make a concerted effort. Both agricultural and water conservancy matters depend on it. This announcement is made. It is learned that the Third District Office convened meetings at Huangwu in Zhuanqiao at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday and in the District Office Conference Room at 3:00 PM yesterday, respectively. The meetings were attended by township chiefs, bao chiefs, jia chiefs, section chiefs, and dam contractors concerned. Attendees included Wang Zhixue, Ru Bocai, Zhao Zhongfang, Lu Dezhong, Zhuang Jinshan, Zhao Xinglin, Sun Shiben, Zhou Yangju, Lu Yingquan, Lu Ruming, Lin Quangen, Ni Binzhi, Zhu Hutang, Zhang Cailin, and over two hundred others. During the meeting, District Chief Zhang reported on the actual situation of the river works and the progress plan. Then, questions were raised for joint discussion, leading to the following resolutions: (1) Dam workers must diligently guard the dams; (2) Accumulated water must be pumped out by the ninth of this month; (3) Collective dredging will resume on the seventh of this month; (4) The District Office will provide additional water pumps to assist with water pumping; (5) Soil deposits on both banks will be removed immediately. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Navigation Administration Bureau Cracks Down on Overloaded Ships</h3>
<p>Deliberate Violations Will Be Prosecuted</p>
<p>The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in view of the unprecedented tragedy caused by the Yongxin steamship of the Shenhu route being overloaded, resulting in the drowning deaths of dozens of male and female passengers, and for the sake of navigation safety, has issued a special order to the Inland River Steamship Industry Association and all shipping bureaus, prohibiting overloading in the future to prevent accidents. The original order reads: "It has been found that the Yongxin steamship on the Shenhu day route suffered an accident in Pingwang, resulting in drowning deaths, which caused an unprecedented tragedy in the inland river. The cause of the accident was the excessive amount of cargo, improper loading, and careless navigation. Hereafter, all inland river shipping companies must not overload passengers or cargo. Except for lightweight and scattered luggage, no cargo is allowed to be loaded on the canopies of the ships to avoid the risk of being top-heavy. Navigation must be handled with utmost care to ensure safety. After this order is issued, anyone who dares to deliberately violate it will be severely punished upon being reported or found to be true after investigation. It is hereby ordered that the association forward this order to all steamship companies (bureaus) for compliance. This order is of utmost importance." After receiving the order, the Inland River Steamship Industry Association of this city immediately instructed its members to comply.</p>

<h3>Robbers Gain Entry Under Pretense of Treating Guests, Carry Out Armed Robbery</h3>
<p>At 10:30 AM yesterday, two robbers wearing blue cloth and gray cloth short jackets and speaking with a Cantonese accent suddenly broke into the home of Tan Tinggan (32 years old, Cantonese), who works at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochangmiao, 9 Zhengfeng Lane, Bansongyuan Road in Nanshi. Posing as if they were treating guests, they displayed pistols and knives to threaten the occupants, driving everyone into one room. Tan had already gone to the shipyard to work, and his wife was out shopping. Only Tan's mother and a maid were at home, and they were all tied up with ropes and gagged with cotton cloth, leaving them to ransack the house at will. As a result, they stole 96 silver dollars, over 20 legal tender, a gold chain, a pair of gold buttons, a platinum watch, a Western-style overcoat, and a gray serge robe. The two robbers, having looted their fill, left with their stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Debt Collection Leads to Bloody Incident</h3>
<p>Di Chengyu, 32 years old, from Yangzhou, works as a coppersmith and lives at the Zhu Chengxing copper shop in Jixiang Lane, Songxue Street. Due to his poverty, at 8:30 AM yesterday, Di's friend sought him to collect a hui contribution. Di had instructed Xu Housheng downstairs to say that Di had gone out. Unexpectedly, Xu Housheng forgot and led the debt collector upstairs. Di became enraged and spoke disrespectfully, and Xu also refused to yield, leading to a fight. Each grabbed wooden stools and crockery to strike the other, resulting in Di suffering several punctures to his face and legs, with blood flowing profusely and serious injuries. However, Xu Housheng's face was also struck several times, resulting in less severe injuries. Neighbors called the police, and Ma Shuquan arrived and took both injured men to the Lao Beimen Police Station. Chief Shen immediately sent the injured men to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. However, Di was penniless and unable to be admitted to the hospital, so he was immediately sent to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>Buck to Perform Benefit Show</h3>
<p>Location Still Carlton, Date Still Under Discussion</p>
<p>The "Buck Battles All-Stars" show has been extremely popular since its performance at the Carlton. This is due to the theater's exceptional artistry. All of the group's performances are extremely beautiful and moving. The quality of the dance is unmatched by ordinary dancers in Shanghai. Even the "Ten Thousand Flowers" troupe that came to China a few years ago was not as good. Furthermore, Buck's martial arts are even more exceptional. The "pulling a car" performance is done entirely with muscle. Even the "Ten Thousand Flowers" troupe did not have this kind of performance. It is said that to repay the kindness of the people of Shanghai, in addition to reducing ticket prices and changing the program every day, the troupe will also perform a benefit show for a certain organization. The location will still be the Carlton, but the date is still under discussion. Everything is in progress. The program for the benefit show will be even more exciting.</p>
<h3>The Finest Toothpaste</h3>
<p>Toothpaste is a daily hygiene product. Although there are many types on the market, most are made of substandard materials that can easily damage tooth enamel. Only "131" toothpaste can effectively whiten teeth, strengthen gums, eliminate odors, and prevent cavities. This toothpaste is made under the supervision of pharmacists, so it has special medicinal effects. It is also made of pure and fine materials, so there is no sound when brushing, so it does not damage the enamel. It is the only fine product among domestic toothpastes. It is sold in all major pharmacies and department stores.</p>
<h3>Zhu Baoxia Opens "Perilous Marriage"</h3>
<p>The Great World Pingju Theater is completely full due to the appeal of the Zhu Baoxia and Zhu Zixia sisters. After the famous Pingju teacher Guan Hongbin directed the plays "Fox Spirit Marriage" and "Good Sister-in-law," he pioneered a new era for Pingju and raised its value considerably. The reputation of the Zhu sisters has increased as a result. The newly arranged "Perilous Marriage" is full of fun and has a compact plot. Baoxia's special new singing style and Zixia's cross-dressing as a young man are both features. It is now in rehearsal and is scheduled to premiere this Saturday night (the 6th). At that time, the Pingju Theater at the Great World will definitely have a new grand occasion.</p>

<h3>Post Office Notice: Add Red Label to Express Letters</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1398 states that domestic express mail should have two horizontal lines drawn at the top and bottom of the envelope, and the words "express" should be written between the two horizontal lines at the top. This is already stipulated in Article 261 of the Postal Regulations. However, most senders have not followed this method, which makes it difficult for the post office to sort express mail. In order to make it easier to identify, a deep red label has been printed as a trial, similar to the method for airmail, and is intended to be attached to the envelope when sending express mail. This label can be obtained by the sender from various post offices. This notice is hereby issued to inform the public. Director Zha Peilin, March 3.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor, We have been commissioned by the Wing On Steamship Bureau to state that the March 1st news column of your newspaper carried a report about the Lake Society's proposal to impound the New Wing On steamer along with the Yongxin steamer of the Yong Shun Steamship Company in connection with the capsizing of the Yongxin. We were shocked to read this. The New Wing On steamer is only entrusted to Yong Shun Company for operation as part of a shipping partnership and this was announced in the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers on March 12 of last year. The Wing On steamer remains the property of our bureau and is not subject to any restrictions. We request that your newspaper make a correction. Sincerely, Chao Jimei, March 3.</p>

<h3>Tianjin-Shanghai Football Match Scheduled for the 26th at Yiyuan</h3>
<p>Tianjin Team to Depart Tianjin on the 22nd</p>
<p>Three Major Battles Scheduled in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Tianjin-Shanghai football match is scheduled to be held on Easter Sunday, the 26th of this month, in Shanghai. The Tianjin team is scheduled to depart Tianjin on the 22nd and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 24th. Three matches will be played in Shanghai before the team returns north on the 29th. The Shanghai Football Club has prepared everything to welcome the Tianjin team. The match schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Match Schedule</p>
<p>March 26th (Friday): Tianjin vs. Shanghai, Inter-port Match, Yiyuan</p>
<p>March 27th (Saturday): Tianjin vs. China, Friendship Match, Shenyuan</p>
<p>March 29th (Monday): Tianjin vs. Army Union, Friendship Match, Yiyuan</p>
<p>If it rains on the 26th or the game ends in a tie, the match schedule may be changed.</p>
<p>No More Trial Matches</p>
<p>Regarding the selection of the Shanghai team, it is reported that the Shanghai Football Club, in order to save time, will no longer hold trial matches. The selection will be based on the team that went to Hong Kong, with slight changes. It has been decided that Laville players will not participate in the inter-port team and will represent the Army Union instead.</p>
<p>Three Matches Analysis</p>
<p>The Tianjin-Shanghai inter-port match has been played five times. Tianjin has won three times, Shanghai has won once, and there has been one tie. The tie occurred in 1934 when the match was held in Shanghai, with each team scoring three goals. As the Hong Kong team was in Shanghai at the time, a triangular match was held. In this three-match series, the Shanghai team, returning victorious from Hong Kong, will face a fierce battle against the Tianjin team. Although the China team did not perform well during its southern tour, with Sun Jinshun, Li Yichen, Jia Youliang, and others all playing in Shanghai, the situation will be greatly changed. Tianjin should also not be optimistic against Laville. Laville recently defeated the Pinghan Railway team 6-1, while Pinghan tied the Beining team 3-3. In addition, Laville's momentum has been great in Shanghai recently, and there are many good players, so they should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Tianjin Preliminary Selection</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tianjin, 4th: The Tianjin-Shanghai football match will soon be held in Shanghai. The Tianjin International Football Club will select 15 outstanding players from various teams to form an army and travel to Shanghai from Tianjin on the 22nd. The second selection match is scheduled for the 7th to determine the official representatives.</p>

<h3>Gentry in Zhenjiang Establish a Large-Scale Middle School</h3>
<p>The location is planned to be outside the East Gate</p>
<p>In the past, Zhenjiang had few private middle schools other than church schools. It was not until ten years ago that the current Women's Vocational Middle School was established. The need for a boys' middle school is particularly urgent. Although Zhenjiang Private Middle School and Dong Middle Vocational School have been established one after another in recent years, there are still many applicants. However, the law is widely adopted, and thousands of out-of-school youths are added every year in Zhenjiang alone. Now it is reported that the gentry Lu Xiaobo, Yan Huiyu, and Leng Yuqiu believe that this is a great loss to the local area and have decided to establish a larger private middle school to remedy it. A few days ago, they reached an agreement with Hu Bijang, Xu Jingren, Tang Shoumin, and other giant merchants in Shanghai to actively carry out the work. The fund has been designated for various public welfare donations, totaling more than 100,000 yuan. The school site is planned to be more than 100 mu of reclaimed land in the suburbs of the East Gate. The construction of a new school building has invited Zhang Haicheng, the former president of Nanjing Middle School, to plan everything, with the goal of enrolling students in the autumn of this year.</p>

<h3>High School Graduation Examination Problems</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>The high school graduation examination method was started in the summer of the 21st year and has been six years now. It has been revised four times, and possible malpractices have been minimized. The voices of opposition have gradually disappeared, but the remaining sound is still endless, just because a system cannot be beneficial without harm, and the remaining abuses of the examination have not yet been completely eradicated. In a blink of an eye, the summer vacation is coming, and provinces and cities will be busy with examination administration. Those who care about education will again have something to discuss. In order to avoid arguments that violate the facts and judgments that fall into errors, we should first review the previous revisions of the examination methods and their implementation. The high school graduation examination method began with the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations on Graduation Examinations for Primary and Secondary School Students in May of the 21st year. In December of the 22nd year, the primary school examination was abolished, and the Regulations on Graduation Examinations for Secondary School Students were promulgated. In April of the 24th year, the Revised Regulations on Graduation Examinations for Secondary School Students were promulgated. In April of the 25th year, an order was issued to change the high school graduation examination method. In November, it was also ordered that the winter examination would still use the previous change method. In the four promulgated decrees before and after the unification, regarding the subjects of the examination, the provisional regulations stipulated that the junior high school was divided into eight subjects: Party Doctrine, Chinese, Arithmetic, History, Geography, Nature, Physical Education, and Foreign Language. The senior high school was divided into ten subjects: Party Doctrine, Chinese, Arithmetic, History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Foreign Language, and Physical Education. The formal regulations stipulated that the junior high school was divided into seven subjects: Civics, Chinese, Arithmetic, Chemistry, Biology, History, Geography, and Foreign Language. The senior high school was divided into nine subjects: Civics, Chinese, Arithmetic, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Geography, and Foreign Language. The revised regulations followed the same unchanged. The change method stipulated that both junior and senior high schools were divided into five subjects: Chinese, Foreign Language, Arithmetic, Chemistry, and History and Geography. Regarding the calculation of grades, the provisional regulations stipulated that the grades of each subject not examined would be sent by each original school to the主管 education administrative agency for review of the calculation methods, etc. The formal regulations stipulated that the calculation method for the grades of each subject of the graduation examination should be based on the school's graduation grades of each subject (the science year grades account for three-fifths of the graduation grades of each subject, and the graduation examination grades of each subject account for two-fifths) accounting for four-tenths, and the grades of each subject of the examination accounting for six-tenths, combined for calculation. The revised regulations stipulated the same, but the so-called school graduation grades of each subject are the average of the three-year grades. The change method stipulated that the sum of the grades of each subject of the examination and the grades of each subject not examined, divided by the sum of the number of examination subjects and the number of subjects not examined, is the total average of the graduation grades. Regarding the problem of school graduation examinations before participating in the graduation examination, although the provisional regulations did not have clear regulations, in June of the 22nd year, the Ministry of Education issued a notice that those who did not participate in the graduation examination, failed, and did not participate in the school graduation examination would not be issued a graduation certificate or a study certificate. It is that the school graduation examination must still be held before the graduation examination. The formal regulations stipulated that the grades of each subject of the graduation examination should account for four-tenths of the school graduation grades of each subject, and the so-called school graduation grades of each subject are calculated by each science year grades accounting for three-fifths and the graduation examination grades of each subject accounting for two-fifths. It is clearly stipulated that the school graduation examination should be held before the graduation examination. The revised regulations abolished the school graduation examination (but junior high schools that do not participate in the examination or sample examination still need to hold a school graduation examination). The graduating students should hold a semester examination for the courses studied in the last semester, and the average grade of each academic year should be the school graduation grade. Regarding the calculation of school grades, the provisional regulations stipulated that the total average of the average grades of all students participating in the examination in each school should be used as the grade of each school, and the grades should be graded and revealed. The formal regulations stipulated that the percentage of (1) the number of graduating students in each school to the number of participants in the examination, (2) the number of participants in the examination to the number of passing students, and (3) the average of the grades of the passing students should be listed as 甲, 乙, 丙, 丁, four grades and revealed. The revised regulations canceled the item of the percentage of the number of participants in the examination to the number of passing students. The change method stipulated that only a list of schools participating in the examination should be issued, and there is no need to calculate school grades based on student grades. This is also a large change in the content of the examination law.</p>

<h3>Yarn</h3>
<p>This month, yarn prices have risen eight times,</p>
<p>Jumping up by $6.60.</p>
<p>American cotton, grade three, soars relentlessly.</p>
<p>Indian merchants return with a bullish approach to buying.</p>
<p>Short positions are rapidly covered, intensifying the reactive surge.</p>
<p>The yarn market has turned firm, and the price surge is intense, primarily due to the continuous rise of yarn and cotton prices overseas.

<p>This month, breaking through the $40 barrier again. At the opening of the cotton yarn market, prices continued to soar due to the bullish market conditions for American cotton, grade three. Market sentiment was high, and the previous day's price drop was deemed too severe. Speculators, sensing a change in the environment, rushed to cover short positions, intensifying the reactive surge and fueling the price increase. However, spot sales remained sluggish, keeping the market relatively stable. Nevertheless, this month has shown signs of a wild surge, rising to a closing price of $240. The grade three yarn price soared by $8.80. The prices for all months of standard yarn were up $2.70 to $3.50 compared to the previous day's closing price. However, this month alone rose by $5.10. At the afternoon opening, the momentum for this month changed dramatically. The market widely speculated that Indian merchant bullish companies bought over 10,000 bales in the morning. Consequently, retail short sellers rushed to cover their positions. The "gold shops," which had sold heavily the previous day, returned to cover their short positions yesterday, further tightening the market. Prices broke through the $40 barrier, and distant months entered a favorable position, but buying decreased. After the second session, the current month surged independently, while distant months remained flat. As a result, the current month rose an additional $1.50 compared to the morning closing price, while distant months rose or fell by $0.20-$0.30. Jinchang and Changfeng bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon. Investigating the sales: Hengyi sold 3,400 bales, Yuda 3,750 bales, Hexing 3,850 bales, Changji 1,550 bales, Renfeng 5,550 bales, Yicheng 1,350 bales, Runkang 1,650 bales, Xiecheng 2,600 bales, Shengyuan 2,400 bales, Yongda 4,200 bales, and Xincheng 2,100 bales. Purchases: Dafeng 1,750 bales, Tongji 1,050 bales, Jinchang 2,700 bales, Gengfeng 4,100 bales, Wang Taixing 3,350 bales, Yida 1,800 bales, Dachangcheng 6,950 bales, Yichang 2,400 bales, Yuanyi 4,150 bales, and Fukang 1,000 bales.</p>
<p>Yarn sales of over 1,100 bales.</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good, more so than before. A total of 1,281 bales were purchased by various firms throughout the day, with selling prices up $1.20. The purchase amounts for each firm are listed below.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton consistently rises.</p>
<p>Cotton reacts violently.</p>
<p>Market short sellers rush to cover their positions.</p>
<p>Distant months break through the $44 barrier.</p>
<p>The cotton market sees a major surge, with bullish sentiment. As American cotton continues to advance, spot prices approach the $0.14 mark. Indian cotton is also high, and Osaka's grade one cotton is up over $2. As a result, market sentiment is stirred, and short sellers rush to cover their positions. At the same time, the yarn market turns bullish, and the price increase becomes even sharper. Futures contracts for both months have risen above the $44 barrier.</p>
<p>Standard cotton rises by $0.75.</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market, prices for all months rose sharply. Due to the continued rise in American and Indian cotton prices, Osaka's grade one cotton rose from $1 to $1.90 for both near and distant months. As a result, market sentiment was shaken, and retail investors covered their positions. However, most believe that domestic cotton inventories are still high, and they are not interested in taking long positions. As a result, the prices for all months rose by $0.50-$0.60 compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, market conditions were quite strong and were driven by the yarn market. Short covering was particularly urgent. Market discussions favored English cotton. As a result, prices for all months rose an additional $0.05-$0.20 compared to the morning closing price. Investigating the sales: Xincheng sold 3,000 dan, Yuanyi 2,800 dan, Yukang 3,200 dan, Hexing 5,100 dan, Changji 2,200 dan, Changyu 2,000 dan, Dachangcheng 5,000 dan, Hengchang 3,200 dan, Dachang 2,500 dan, Changhe 4,800 dan, Tonghe 2,400 dan, Yongchang 1,300 dan, and Runkang 1,800 dan. Purchases: Tongji 11,600 dan, Hengyi 7,200 dan, Yuda 4,800 dan, Mingde 5,200 dan, Ruidi 2,400 dan, Shenda 3,500 dan, Yichang 2,200 dan, and Yuanxingchang 5,100 dan.

<p>Spot cotton mill needs are gradually becoming active.</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still good, and mill needs are gradually increasing. Yao cotton is arriving, 1,600 bales.</p>
<p>American cotton price increases intensify.</p>
<p>There are new sellers for distant months as well.</p>
<p>Spot prices approach the $0.04 mark.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with good news from Liverpool and unpredictable foreign political situations. Spot cotton was firm, and domestic and foreign traders actively bought, with prices rising by 3 to 13 points. Although large numbers of long positions were closed and cotton farmers hedged, these were absorbed by speculators. Even new cotton for distant months was being purchased by new speculators. The closing of old long positions had already been taken over, so in reality, market conditions became even firmer. At the closing, the public actively bought, and the market continued to rise, with spot prices up 27 points and futures prices up 21-30 points. English cotton spot prices were up 6 points, and futures prices were up 15-16 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to good news from abroad, then weakened due to the closing of long positions, but ultimately, due to a strong stock market, trader purchases, and short covering, prices rose again. Plain Gaw爾 rose by 2.25-2.5 rupees, 奥姆辣 by 2.5-3 rupees, and White羅溪 by 3.25-3.5 rupees. (Telegram from the 3rd)</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 4th was White羅溪 at 235 rupees, 奥姆辣 at 216.25 rupees, and Plain Gaw爾 at 188.25 rupees, all up 3.75 rupees.</p>
<p>Private estimates of American cotton acreage slightly increase.</p>
<p>New York, 3rd (Telegram) - The Chamber of Commerce's current estimate of cotton acreage is 33,425,000 acres. The previous estimate (February 11th) was 33,371,000 acres.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Spring and summer cotton goods sales suddenly surge.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was gloomy and rainy. Once it cleared up and the weather turned warm, sales of light-colored spring and summer goods suddenly surged. At the same time, overseas cotton markets continued to rise, and standard yarn and cotton also rebounded rapidly. After the sharp drop in white goods, Dong Pi fine cloth rebounded strongly yesterday. The leading Longtou fine cloth rose by $0.10 in the morning market and later increased to $0.20. Other grades also rose by $0.05-$0.15. Japanese trading houses offered over 200 pieces of Longtou brand fine cloth for April, May, and June delivery in the morning. The opening price for Longtou was $9, and in the afternoon, it was quoted at $9.10. Fine twills from domestic factories and Eastern goods also rebounded by $0.05. Raw cloth, coarse cloth, and coarse twills remained flat. Transactions in white goods were mostly for Dong Pi fine cloth, with traders covering short positions, totaling over 1,000 pieces. Fine twills from Chinese and foreign factories were taken up by domestic and Yangtze River/Yunnan merchants, totaling nearly 300 bales. Among light-colored goods, striped and plain silk crepe had good momentum, with demand increasing from both northern and southern merchants, domestic merchants, and local retailers, totaling over 500 boxes. Satin, floral cloth, bleached cloth, and Shilin bamboo also sold well, but dark-colored woolens and blue cloth sales gradually turned sluggish.</p>
<h3>Capital Merchants Busily Procure Western-style Woolens</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market saw a great deal of trade yesterday. Sales of Western-style woolens were stronger than those of ordinary Chinese-style fabrics. Customers from the capital (Beijing) mostly came to Shanghai in person to make purchases, and their demand was stronger than in the past. They were actively procuring Western-style materials such as medium-thick serge, Herringbone, Chong Shi Pao Tuike (冲師泡推克), Four Seas Lishi (四·海力斯), Ha Wei (哈味), lotus woolen fabric, floral flannel, and feather yarn. Payment terms were half cash and half credit. Dealers were busy processing sales orders all day. Shipping and postal deliveries for export were also congested. Standard prices were even more favorable than last week.</p>
<p>Yuanfang's auction prices fluctuated.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Thursday, was the 3027th auction of Yuanfang Trading Company, featuring Western satin, yuan velvet, Zhigong woolen fabric, feather silk, yuan silk crepe, foreign red cloth, white cotton yarn, and bleached white cloth, totaling eight categories and 32 brands, with only 33 boxes in total. The market saw scattered purchases from merchants and inland river traders, while local sales were lackluster. The current offerings mainly consisted of single boxes per brand. Dealers showed little competition in purchasing, and auction prices fluctuated. Western satin prices were a few cents lower than the previous auction for three brands. Yuan velvet and Zhigong woolen fabric each rose by one or two cents for one brand. Yuan silk crepe was not listed for a long time, and its price was also average. Twenty-three brands of yuan feather silk were auctioned. Compared to the previous auction, the price of the Zhulin Luanfeng Cai Bashi (竹林鸞鳳彩八士) brand increased from $0.70 to $1, while the Shibazi and Bozi Tu brands increased from $0.75 to $1.40. The Monkey Deer brand rose by $0.60, and the rest rose by one or two cents. Foreign red cloth prices were firm for heavy grades. White cotton yarn and bleached white cloth, being spring season goods, were listed at firm prices. (Announcement) Next Thursday, Renluntu white silk crepe will be added.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>The wheat market shifts from steady to rising.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally stable in the morning, with minimal fluctuations. Due to mixed movements in foreign wheat prices and market buying and selling partially shifting to the flour market, near- and distant-month contracts initially showed slight gains, followed by a slight decline in distant-month contracts due to weather conditions. At the afternoon opening, the market initially appeared stable, but then the flour market rebounded, and the yarn and cotton markets also rebounded sharply, causing prices for all months to gradually rise, increasing by 3 to 5 cents. The spot wheat market was quiet due to limited arrivals and mill demand. Only about 400 bags of Huangqiao wheat were reported to have opened, with prices similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>Flour futures also change in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed initial declines followed by gains after the morning opening. Foreign wheat prices were reported as Chicago down $0.10-$0.20, Canada down $0.04 for near-month and $0.10-$0.20 for distant-month contracts, while Liverpool was up 2 pence. After opening prices were quoted, the market was initially stable due to mixed movements in foreign wheat prices. However, as the weather cleared, outside bullish investors actively sold, causing March and April contracts to ease, with the lowest price falling to the $4.00 level, down $0.02-$0.03 from the previous day. July and August contracts saw more active trading and were only down by $0.01. At the afternoon opening, market sentiment suddenly turned bullish due to the rapid rise in yarn and cotton prices and rumors of international borrowing. Short sellers covered their positions, and mills took the opportunity to buy, causing near-month contracts to rebound by about $0.01. July and August contracts also improved by $0.01-$0.02 due to the rebound in near-month contracts. In the future, unless there are special changes overseas, the market is expected to fluctuate.</p>
<p>Soybeans and sesame seeds show different price movements.</p>
<p>Recently, foreign sesame seeds have shown a declining trend due to sluggish sales and lifeless market sentiment. Prices have fallen below the $14.00 level with no one interested, making the overall situation difficult to predict. Spot raw sesame seeds are fortunate to have sporadic purchases from Japanese traders, allowing prices to stabilize. Soybean prices continue to rise by $0.03-$0.04, driven by strong sales of soybean cakes (with 36,000 pieces of cake sold by various factories from Shantou, Xiamen, and inland regions yesterday). Mill demand remains steady, and local demand in this street and inland regions remains strong. Dalian has also rebounded again, making market sentiment appear stable. Yesterday, a total of over 4,000 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans, three truckloads of Sipingjie soybeans, two truckloads of Yingzhou soybeans, and one truckload of Linhuaiguan soybeans were opened, with other soybeans also seeing 600-700 bags traded.</p>
<p>Ke Xian rice sells the most to Guangdong, followed by the local street.</p>
<p>The arrival of Ke Xian rice has slightly decreased recently, but sales to Guangdong remain strong. Rough rice inventories are scarce, making market conditions even more bullish. The machine-milled rice has been actively purchased by Guangdong merchants, and the market has also turned firmer. Rough rice prices continue to rise sharply, and machine-milled rice is also approaching the level. A total of over 17,000 bags were opened, with Guangdong merchants accounting for the most, around 10,000 bags. The local street was next, with Xiamen, Shantou, and North China merchants each purchasing several hundred bags. The main type of rice sold was Gan rice, totaling 14,210 bags, followed by Xiang rice at 3,250 bags, Han rough rice at 330 bags, and Yongyuan at 270 bags.</p>
<p>Rice prices in both the Northern and Southern markets fall again and again.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over 30 firms brought a total of 6,000 shi of goods. Sales in the local market remained sluggish. After boatmen lowered prices, sales increased slightly. Merchants from Xi'an and Qingdao only purchased 700-800 bags of thin-skinned rice, causing market conditions to decline. Thick Japonica rice prices were reduced by $0.15, while thin-skinned rice prices fell by $0.10-$0.18. Dujian depreciated by nearly $0.10, and Yinwu fell by about $0.10.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 70-80 boats from various waterways arrived at the gate. Due to warmer weather, demand for all goods on the market was even more sluggish, and the market showed a trend of prolonged weakness and brief gains. Yesterday, the market price for top-quality white Japonica rice was flat and weak, while the prices for medium- and low-quality rice fell by a few cents to $0.10. Early rice followed, down by $0.07-$0.08, and thin-skinned rice was also down by $0.05-$0.06. Yangbu Jian prices were down nearly $0.10, while Dujian and Ke Jian fell by $0.03-$0.05. Yinbian Yuan prices were down a few cents from the previous market, and the prices of all other goods were weak.</p>

Bank posted rates showed the British pound and US dollar were both flat, and customs gold units were unchanged. The standard posted gold price remained at 1156.4 yuan.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Large Accounts Rarely Enter or Exit</p>
<p>Bond prices remain good, up $0.30-$0.40.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market tended to be firm. Large accounts rarely entered or exited. However, a certain firm sold about one million in long-term Class A bonds, which was a relatively large amount. Otherwise, only Firm 16 bought, which was relatively more than others, who all made scattered transactions. The trend has become a consolidation, and the market price is not much different from the previous high. If there are flaws, the decline will also be very rapid. The course of yesterday was that the market price was slightly firm at the opening in the morning, and there was some short covering on the table. Although Firm 18 and Firm 57 sold, Firm 16 and retail investors were quite interested in buying. Although the market was consolidating, it was still raised by $0.10-$0.20.

Only at the close did Firm 54 offer long-term Class A bonds, but the price of Class A bonds was relatively cheap, and there were many buyers, still gaining $0.10. The future of the market price is not likely to see major ups and downs for the time being. As a result, market prices rose uniformly by $0.10-$0.40. The total number of transactions was 4,390,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

It is learned that current factory prices are $810 for white factory 78 uniform RR and $780 for local silk, but there are still few large transactions. American and French dealers are still more active in high-grade factory silk. Domestic silk consumption is also weak, with only scattered trading. The Shanghai silk market has a trend of turning firm with Japan and the US.</p>
<p>Tea Firms Prepare to Open Market</p>
<p>Local tea, such as Ping Shui, has been on hold due to the proposed unified production and sales plan of the United Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces. It is now learned that the company's affairs will not be easy to realize this year due to the wide scope. As a result, each tea firm is preparing to open the market as before. In addition to the partial reorganization of Hongyuan, Yongshengchang, and Changsheng firms, Ning Shenji has been added to operate the tea firm business.</p>
<p>The Tunxi Tea Industry Market is Thriving</p>

<h3>Preparation Method of Income Tax Return Forms (2)</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>(3) Business Type: The business type is the business operated by the firm. The business of each firm should be fixed. According to Article 12 of the Implementing Rules, any purchase or sale of goods, securities, or gold and silver currency unrelated to the main business, and whose income is not calculated under the main business income, is considered a temporary profit-making enterprise. According to Article 12 of the Draft Notice on the Collection of Income Tax for First-Category Profit-Making Enterprises, losses other than the main and subsidiary businesses are not considered necessary and reasonable expenses and losses in business. If the taxpayer lists them in the profit and loss statement, they should be removed when calculating net profit. The scope of the business type filled in this form should not be too narrow. When operating a certain type of goods, the manufacturing or sales matters should be clearly stated at the same time. For example, the yarn number of a yarn store selling cotton yarn should be filled in as the sale of cotton yarn. A sugar store that manufactures and sells sugar should be filled in as the manufacture and sale of sugar.</p>
<p>(4) Firm Address: The address should be filled in in detail, such as No. 14 Defeng Lane, Beijing Road, Shanghai. If there are warehouses or factories in other places within the same tax area, it is not necessary to fill them in together and can be filled in separately in the remarks section. There is no need to fill in another return form. However, warehouses and factories that use another name, or whose capital is divided and whose business is completely independent, should be reported on a separate form.</p>
<p>(5) Actual Amount of Business Capital or Share Capital: The Provisional Regulations on Income Tax define capital in Article 3 as the actual amount of capital, and in Article 4 as the capital amount. The Detailed Implementing Rules define capital in Article 5 and Article 6 as capital, and in Article 7 as the capital that refers to the share capital actually paid in by companies organized under the company structure or the principal actually invested by other organizations. Article 46 refers to the actual amount of capital and share capital. The Notice on the Collection of Income Tax for First-Category Profit-Making Enterprises defines capital in Article 2, Article 3, Article 6, Article 7, Article 12, Article 19, and Article 20 as capital or capital amount. This form is an applicable return form for non-company organized commercial firms, row stations, factories, and profitable individuals. And this type of profitable business, except for individual operators, should be a partnership organization. Partnerships also have what is called share money. The business capital referred to in this form is in principle the capital of individual operators. The actual amount of share capital is the capital filled in by partnership organizations, and one of them can be selected. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Dostoevsky's Pushkin Speech</h3>
<p>— Chen Hannian</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen many speeches and writings by celebrities and scholars commemorating the poet Pushkin in newspapers and magazines, which cannot help but remind me of Dostoevsky's Pushkin speech. Dostoevsky's speech is a historically valuable document in Russian literary circles. It was delivered on June 6, 1880, at the opening ceremony of the Pushkin memorial in Moscow. This ceremony was organized by the Russian Literary Friends Association, and many writers were invited to participate, with Dostoevsky and Turgenev being the two most famous.</p>
<p>The ceremony continued for several days. The first evening was a Pushkin poetry reading, followed by two days of banquets and speeches. The seventh was Turgenev's speech. Turgenev was still considered the most prestigious writer in the minds of most people at the time. He praised Pushkin's genius, especially his Russian genius, with his noble, cultivated, and gentle attitude. He said that he was the poet of the motherland, the supreme poet of the motherland. But at the end, he raised two questions: Did Pushkin belong to Europe? Did this great Russian have universality?</p>
<p>The eighth was Dostoevsky's speech. His speech was prepared a few days earlier, so when he was preparing, he did not consider Turgenev's literary views. Dostoevsky and Turgenev differed greatly in their thinking, one being a Slavophile and the other a Westernizer, and their hostility was deep due to these differences. However, by coincidence, his speech resonated with Turgenev in many places, and unintentionally answered Turgenev's questions.</p>
<p>"Never has there been a poet as universal as Pushkin," Dostoevsky said. "He is not only universal, but this universality is so profound that he can embrace and absorb foreign spirits in his soul; it is because of this talent that Pushkin's power is expressed. What is the power of the Russian national spirit if it is not an aspiration towards a world spirit that embraces the entire globe and all of humanity? Because Pushkin uttered the power of the nation, he foresaw and predicted its future significance. Therefore, he is a prophet. What is the significance of Peter the Great's reforms for us? These reforms are not just about adopting European clothes, customs, education, and science. People adopted those things in order to unite and love the world. There is no hostility, only friendship and affection. We incorporate all foreign geniuses into our spirit and can intuitively and quickly distinguish, eliminate contradictions, and reconcile differences; thereby, we express our readiness and desire. We, who have just united ourselves, hope to create a universal unity. The significance of the Russian race is undoubtedly European and global. To be a true Russian and to be a complete Russian, the meaning lies in this: to be a brother to all mankind, possessing universal humanity. This is called Slavophilism; … I have long believed that we—perhaps not us, but future generations of Russians—each of us will know that being a true Russian must have such a meaning; to come up with a solution, to end Europe's disputes; to point Europe to a path in the Russian soul that avoids her suffering; to inject into her a kinship of brotherhood within the four seas, and perhaps, in the end, to announce the great, ultimate message of global harmony, as the Gospel of Jesus says, that is, the eternal harmony of the friendship of all mankind."</p>
<p>In this section of his speech, Dostoevsky was no less than issuing a declaration for Slavophilism, but his Slavophilism is by no means comparable to general narrow nationalism (Chauvinism). It contains a lofty ideal: internationalism.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic emotions that the audience was aroused by this speech were unprecedented and almost unbelievable. As soon as he took the stage, a long burst of applause made it impossible for him to begin speaking. He finally spoke, but every section and every paragraph was constantly interrupted by applause. He spoke excitedly and powerfully, and when he finally spoke of universal love, the entire auditorium seemed to have gone mad. The joyful shouts of the audience were truly indescribable; they cried, hugged, and vowed to love each other. Ladies, government officials, and students all crowded in front of him, hugging him and kissing him. Two old men came up to him and said, "We have been enemies for twenty years; but we have just reconciled—through you. You are our saint, our prophet." Then there was a roar from the whole hall: Prophet! Prophet! His enemy Turgenev also ran over, hugging him tightly, with tears in his eyes, and said, "You are a genius, more than a genius." The poet Aksakov jumped onto the podium and loudly told the audience that his speech was not just a speech, but a historical event. The students swarmed over. One student, with tears streaming down his face, fell at his feet and fainted. The Russian Literary Friends Association immediately elected him as an honorary member. Again, there was a frenzy of cheers. According to the program, Aksakov should have spoken next, but Aksakov was willing to abstain. He said, "Our genius Dostoevsky has said everything and solved everything." At this time, Dostoevsky was very tired and wanted to leave and rest, but the audience would not let him leave. They prepared a huge laurel wreath, and at the end of the meeting, more than a hundred women jumped onto the podium and placed it on his head in front of the entire audience. "We represent all the women of Russia, you spoke so well for them." Everyone shed tears. Enthusiastic cheers resounded throughout the auditorium again.</p>
<p>The poet Pushkin was a prophet who sang of liberation and freedom, and now true liberation and freedom have been realized in his motherland. The novelist Dostoevsky was also a prophet in his Pushkin speech. He prophesied global harmony and universal love for all mankind; but now the world is full of gunpowder, and butchers are shamelessly provoking national hatred. The Russian people, with their decades of arduous struggle, finally enjoyed the poet's prophecy on the centenary of the poet's birth. Then, the people of the world today will surely use the same arduous struggle to realize the novelist's prophecy—the day of this realization may come even before the centenary of this prophet.</p>
<h3>The Youth of Pushkin – W. Eaworsky</h3>
<h3>Continued Records of Love in Mountain Country</h3>
<p>— Han Gu</p>
<p>When young men and women in Yulong become acquainted, there are two ways they gather:</p>
<p>One is "getting up extremely early." That is, they agree on the first day to meet on the hillside the next day at dawn. When the sky is turning fish-belly white, with a few scattered stars hanging in the sky, and the mountains and forests are lying quietly, with the Jinsha River seemingly not yet awake, the girl waits very early at the agreed place. Seeing the boy coming, she opens her throat and sings:</p>
<p>"I say, a carrying pole with water buckets on both ends, don't joke, I'm telling you, the love hangs on that side."</p>
<p>The boy hears it and continues to sing:</p>
<p>"I say, sister! This brother would rather die under the flowering tree, don't joke, I'm telling you, bury me at the roots of the flowering tree."</p>
<p>The two sit in the forest, listening to the morning birds singing, smelling the fragrance of wild flowers, and whispering sweet words until the sun rises high and the mountain is filled with human shadows before reluctantly returning home.</p>
<p>On the way home, the girl will sing a "provincial tune" while watching the boy's back!</p>
<p>"Chopping water spinach leaves, both ends are empty, what two people do, only they know, swallows carrying mud must keep their mouths steady, spiders drawing silk keep it in their bellies."</p>
<p>The other is "melon seed cracking," which means that they meet and chat while cracking melon seeds. "Melon seed cracking" mostly takes place in the mountain forests. The girls carry some fruit, candied fruit, cakes, melon seeds, and other things to the mountain. They sit on sheepskins, and the girls gather with a few female companions, sitting in a circle, talking about each other, and singing provincial tunes, Dali tunes, Menghua tunes, and local tunes. After sitting for an hour or two, they reluctantly return home.</p>
<p>When it comes to festivals, such as Mid-Autumn Festival or Dragon Boat Festival, the girls make elaborate preparations to send gifts to the boys, including cakes, fruits, candied fruits, shoes (sewn by the girl herself), hats… The boys accept them without any shame because the economic power in Yulong is mostly in the hands of the girls. The girls mostly have "private savings," and their economic ability is very sufficient, so they can afford to send many things to the boys. The boys sometimes reciprocate, sometimes they don't, which is commonly called "snatching."</p>
<p>In Yulong, because boys and girls are betrothed to each other from a young age, it is rare for them to marry out of love. Sometimes, young men and women are too dissatisfied with the wedding date and will jump into the Jinsha River together or hang themselves in the mountain forests, but most of them bow their heads in obedience. After marrying the husband arranged by their parents and raising children, when they encounter their former lovers, they only smile at each other.</p>
<h3>Night on the Road to Gu'an</h3>
<p>— Wang Shifeng</p>
<p>Darkness is like the tide from the edge of the sky,</p>
<p>Submerging the vast white future,</p>
<p>The Big Dipper is embedded in the high sky,</p>
<p>One can vaguely distinguish the ditches and roads.</p>
<p>On the dark and silent plain,</p>
<p>A dozen young people are stumbling,</p>
<p>Stepping on the shadows of the people in front,</p>
<p>Their feet rise and fall in the loose soil.</p>
<p>One wrong step,</p>

<p>"I'm not tired either."</p>
<p>What forges the strength of these young people,</p>

<h3>Drama Again</h3>
<p>— Ling Jun</p>
<p>I happened to think of drama and wrote a few useless words, but unexpectedly, I stumbled upon the drama year of 1937. Since I unintentionally joined in the fun, it's all the same whether I say more or less, so it's drama again.</p>
<p>The drama year has just begun, and some people are worried about a shortage of scripts. This bucket of cold water is too ruthless, although the actual situation seems to indicate that this is possible. Not long ago, two theater troupes competed to stage a certain script. Now, a certain theater troupe wants to stage a certain script, but the playwright does not agree, but agrees to let another theater troupe perform it and direct it for them. But this has nothing to do with the actual shortage of scripts. The latter approach can precisely avoid the first dispute. This will naturally cause a greater shortage of scripts for theater troupes that are not supported by playwrights, but that is no longer a question of script shortage, but a question of how a theater troupe can not have the support of a playwright. Because performance rights have always been neglected, some people dare to rashly organize theater troupes, preparing to perform any available scripts they can drag in. Since this main support relies on randomness, other aspects of support feel even more random. As a result, even if there is a good script, because other conditions are not sufficient to support a theater troupe, the performance is also a failure. If staging a script requires consideration of the playwright's support, then when organizing a theater troupe, one must first consider the completeness of the conditions that can obtain the playwright's support, then the chances of failure are less, and the playwright will undoubtedly be willing to support them. Of course, assuming that there are too many theater troupes with complete conditions, and the playwrights are too few and not enough to distribute, there will still be a shortage of scripts, but we cannot say that there is a need to prepare for this assumption now. Compared to actors, our playwrights do not seem to be few.</p>
<p>If there are too many playwrights and nowhere to stage their scripts, they will support any theater troupe indiscriminately. Of course, some of them only seek performance and do not care about the outcome. These can be completely ignored. Some are completely mistaken in overestimating the ability of the script and the ability of the playwright. Playwrights who come from actors or can also act in plays may be the best playwrights, but they are also often the worst. If their acting skills are only ordinary, then the scripts they write do not require higher skills to perform. Our spoken drama movement has not yet created an actor who can get a particularly high evaluation, but among playwrights, there are many authors who have acted in plays. This is also the reason why some playwrights have no choice in theater troupes. Perhaps we can see some playwrights uniting to perform the plays they write themselves. If we expect that they may not be able to perform well, because it is too unrealistic, that theater troupe will not be a stable theater troupe.</p>
<p>Since the promotion of amateur theater to save the decline of civilized drama, there are almost no non-amateur theater troupes. At first, they were very secretive about professional drama. Now, professional and non-professional are no longer a problem. If an amateur theater troupe is required to continue performing, then even if it is amateur, it must become professional. It is said that now audiences and theater managers both have this requirement. We hope that the first one to be required can become a stable one. As mentioned above, to have a stable theater troupe, one must have the support of the playwright. And when a theater troupe's acting skills can determine the success or failure of a play, its support for the writer may be greater than the writer's support for it. A script failing due to a bad performance is the most unjust failure. Being able to re-evaluate a written script fairly is the greatest contribution to Chinese drama and the greatest help to the author. We can hardly expect a theater troupe to do this in practice, but it must have a theater troupe with such ability. And the guarantee of this ability seems to be best expressed by performing world-famous plays, which is a relatively usable method.</p>
<p>Since there are many plays that should be performed for the theater troupe itself, and there are many plays that should be performed for the contribution to drama, we are at least not near a script shortage, and cannot be compared with the situation in the civilized drama era, when both Chinese and foreign scripts were lacking. Saying that people are afraid of a script shortage is to defend finding materials from old operas for it, which may be too far-fetched, but I still have to mention that even if there is a script shortage, we cannot seek help from improving old operas, lest we fall again.</p>
<h3>Bai Wei's "Tragic Life"</h3>
<p>— Chu Yang</p>
<p>Before this "tragic era" comes to an end, isn't life always "tragic"? Ancient philosophers once said that human history is a history of "struggle," and it can also be said to be a history of "tragedy"! Why do people like to watch tragedies? From ancient Greece to the present, great literary works are all tragedies. Is tragedy the root of life, the fate of mankind? If we investigate the origin of tragic art and its social value from the perspective that "literature is merely a reflection of life," it is easy to discover that tragedy expresses the reality of life.</p>
<p>Everyone living in a declining society, whether they are awakened or dreaming, who can escape this great historical tragedy? The life reality of an individual under the great historical tragedy is nothing but tragic.</p>
<p>If my view is not regarded as "pessimistic philosophy" and can be recognized as a rational observation, then I think it is extremely meaningful and interesting that Ms. Bai Wei used the four words "Tragic Life" as the title of her "Autobiography." Readers will probably not forget that she is a playwright, a passionate female poet; because she deeply understands tragic art, and she herself has experienced the tragedy of real life in family, society, and love, then her use of her own life to write a vivid history of life and title it "Tragic Life" is not something lightly applied!</p>
<p>"Tragic Life" can be said to be an "autobiographical novel," or a "novel-like autobiography"; but after reading it, I don't think it is a novel, nor is it an autobiography. This is a record of a woman's life, bravely fighting against the ugly feudal patriarchal society, and it is a confession of a passionate new woman who loves freedom and seeks liberation. I read Bai Wei's book with great emotion and piety, just like I am absorbed in Xu Sao's "Confessions," which is full of humanistic cries and boldly shocked the literary world.</p>
<p>I don't want to exaggerate anything for the author. It's best to listen to the author's own explanation. The author said: "It is not necessarily the lives of great men that are worthy of biographies. Small people may have more truth, because the smaller a person is, the less necessary it is to have many false masks, and the more they can come into contact with the darkness and cruelty of society, and even more strongly experience life and demand light and truth. But how much can a cruel society give him, and how much will it exploit him, so that he can feel more and more of the truth.</p>
<p>"This thing is about a 'Nora' who escaped from feudal forces, her desire to move upward, to break through all the encirclements, to fight for her own liberation and the liberation of the masses, and freedom. Unfortunately, she fell into what world, and how was everything destroyed by the cruel devil's hand, and she is still struggling in suffering, living a long and miserable life with a deep desire to move forward.</p>
<p>"It is a sketch, a drawing, a bold, true, pure, passionate, and naked record of a moving 'life' without any concealment. It is a fact more tragic than pear blossoms in a storm, the cry of a suffering soul in hell, it is painting, it is also poetry, it is a love affair of young men and women with different thoughts, it is also an anatomical diagram of the sexes, a product of the times, it is a clear outline of a typical personality, it is also a deep contradiction between work and love, it is the turmoil of the entire semi-colonial country, and the faint writing of colonialized national character, and it is also a red-blooded confession of a pure and passionate woman who wants to move forward."</p>
<p>A book, if you don't read it, no matter how you introduce it, it's useless, especially a pure and legendary book. Therefore, I don't want to describe its contents in detail in this short article. The content of "Tragic Life" can be simply said that ten years of suffering runs through the life, struggle, and struggle of a woman who escaped from the old prison city (family) and fell into a new sea of ​​suffering (society), and finally still struggles! —I am afraid it will be a struggle forever, right? —Unless this social ship can reach the bright shore—. Because a deformed love tightly entangles the protagonist of the tragedy like a poisonous snake, this book also completely uses that tortuous and complicated love as the central thread of the whole book. When you first read it, you can't imagine why a love affair has so many tendrils and vines. After you finish reading it, you will also be surprised that the great tragedy of this love life is so complex and rich, which really makes some simple and innocent young men and women deeply feel the "horror" of such love: isn't that a youth toxin? How precious is the healthy life of society! To truly understand this book, it is necessary to have a sound worldview and outlook on life, and, more importantly, a correct view of the sexes and love. This is not a book to intoxicate you, but a book to guide you to criticize. Reader! You will not hesitate to sympathize with the protagonist of the tragedy and the author of this book with your pure tears, but society is cruel, and the facts are cruel. The author did not attempt to exchange your fragile and pathetic neurotic tears with her tears, which have long flowed into a deep pool that she can jump into and be forever submerged. In order to express the truth of her life, that is, the truth of society, the author has already transcended the cruelty of the facts and expressed the truth more cruelly than the facts. Therefore, this book is not only a passionate work but also a rational work.</p>
<p>However, a person who can criticize, or a person who is good at sympathy, may not necessarily be able to perceive the benefits of this book. Or even some young people who have "cleanliness" about love, or look down on the theme of writing romantic love, will even feel disgusted with this book and the author. To discover the benefits, you should first grasp the following points: First, you must understand that the protagonist written in the book—that is, the author herself—is a typical passionate woman. If she were to play Shakespeare's tragedy, she would indeed be an ideal Ophelia for a great director. Her passion can be compared to any passionate female character in Goethe's books. Unfortunately, she was born in modern times, born in China, in the period of transition between old and new trends in the East; although she escaped from the ancient family, escaped from the marriage of sale, escaped from feudal ethics, and even escaped to a foreign land that was free from these old shackles, she lived a life of labor and a life of freedom. When she liberated herself, she was lost in that colorful Romantic love, and she ended up becoming a victim of "sacred love," unable to extricate herself for ten years! Furthermore, we should know the era in which our protagonist lived. She was entirely a product of the Romanticism of the May Fourth Movement—here, it not only refers to the meaning of "literature" but refers to the general situation from thought to life. At that time, the cult of aesthetics and emotions, and the supremacy of love, were rampant among new young men and women. At that time, they were full of romantic fantasies and regarded love as the primary meaning of life. The protagonist's passionate personality combined with this trend of thought created her life from then on. Although her life was not immutable, she was also advancing with the times. She also plunged into the whirlpool of the Great Revolution and participated in the social and cultural movements around 1930; but the lifeline that had been forged long ago always bound her, and she was tossed in the poisonous disease of love, surviving nine deaths and one life, and finally was "missing," leaving only a glimmer of hope for "light"! There is also one point. We cannot observe in isolation the many people and things surrounding the protagonist. Why is our protagonist's lover such a person? What kind of drama is that "Red" lady playing again? The infatuated doctor and Mr. K, her many friends, and those social lives and activities that are not described in detail, how do they constitute the protagonist's entire tragic life? We must not fail to discern her life, her thoughts, her emotions, and her admirable and shameful aspects from the protagonist's environment. We want to study the social nature of this personal tragedy: because the personal tragedy is caused by the social tragedy.</p>
<p>If the author could more clearly reveal the social nature of her own tragedy, the meaning of this book would be even greater; unfortunately, the focus of her writing is on the description of love. The repeated and layered writing is somewhat uneconomical in some places, which makes the reader feel tired. Her life experience spans the varied periods of the nation's history, such as the May Fourth Movement, 1925-27, September 18th, and January 28th. If she could use these major historical backgrounds as the backdrop of her life, with herself as the protagonist and center, and weave more of her life records into it, how much would it increase the brilliance of the whole book? But she has written it this way after all, and we can only forgive her for writing it "when the black clouds were so oppressive that one could not breathe."</p>
<p>What compelled my heartstrings as I read on and on was the author's passionate and overwhelming writing style. I remember when the author published her long novel "Bombs and Warhorses," Mr. Lu Xun praised her unique style. Her description is indeed "rough" as she said herself (many places are very "bold"), but her "roughness" does not hinder the beauty of her writing. Although there are many descriptions that are too abstract and use too many abstract words, which are objectionable, but that is another matter.</p>
<p>This book also has no "structure." It is entirely her own "inspiration." The entire book is in five chapters, long and short, not closely combined. Each can stand alone, and it is entirely her passionate momentum that merges them into a long river.</p>
<p>Finally, I am surprised that the author's vitality is still so strong after seven or eight years of chronic illness. Embracing serious illness, enduring great pain, in the horror of "the book is not finished but the body dies first," she completed this 300,000-word creation in a few intermittent months. It is truly a tragic song of "death or life?" I hope she will no longer sing this "self-tragic song," and use her life from now on to write a greater "tragic life" for the dying Chinese nation, the people seeking life in death, and the women suffering from layers of oppression. In this great "tragic life," she will begin her "history of light"!</p>
<h3>A News Reporter</h3>
<p>— Lao Yan</p>
<p>Impressions from Fifteen Years Ago</p>
<p>A few days ago, I met the famous reporter Huang Jiping. He told me a story. He said that he still cannot forget this matter. The following are the words of Mr. Huang.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang said: "About fifteen years ago, my father suffered from anemia and was very weak. He wanted to take some tonics, but he couldn't find anything suitable for a while. My mother was so worried that she couldn't sleep or eat. She happened to see an advertisement for 'Artificial Self-Flowing Blood' in the newspaper. According to the doctor, he could try it. So I bought a dozen boxes by mail. After taking it for two months, his Qi and blood were indeed stronger. I firmly believed that 'Self-Flowing Blood' was a wonderful product for replenishing blood. After taking it continuously for a year, my father's body had recovered to health. Our family is very grateful to Wuzhou Pharmacy for creating the new medicine. Although the matter has passed for fifteen years, the impression in my mind has not been erased to this day."</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Eating Germs and Cooking Children</h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>Just after seeing a strange person in the newspaper who could swallow all kinds of germs, now I see news of cooking children's corpses to treat leprosy. To quote an old saying, it's called "The world is so big, there is nothing that is not strange."</p>
<p>Situ Qi, who swallowed germs, returned from Nanjing after being rejected. When he came to Shanghai, only a few newspapers did a "feature" on him; and the Department of Health said that he had a mental illness. Whether that strange person can really eat germs, it can only end without resolution, becoming a "pending case."</p>
<p>Everyone who becomes a "person" wants to "live to be a hundred years old." When a child is born, the eight characters must be arranged first to see if there are any "inauspicious stars," otherwise, the blind fortune teller will first make a good sale, called "resolving the stars." It seems that after one "resolution," it is guaranteed to be long-lived. If the small life is really impatient to live and dies halfway, that is "fate," which cannot be saved by human power.</p>
<p>Because they are afraid of "death," people are most afraid of getting sick. As the saying goes, "Even a hero is most afraid of being worn down by illness." Even if he is a "hero," he seems unable to withstand it when he gets sick. And now science is progressing too fast. Many germs that ears have never heard of are "invented" by those "fools" in laboratories; and there are no medicines to overcome these many new germs. For example, for lung disease, even the most famous doctors in Germany and Japan have not yet invented a medicine that can directly kill tubercle bacilli. And lung disease is developing so universally. I remember that in a small school, the results of examining students showed that about 4.3 out of 10 were suffering from lung disease. Those small lives are probably "unlucky" and will be ended by tubercle bacilli. Therefore, Mr. Situ Qi's "invention" of being able to eat germs is really a savior from heaven! He seems very confident that his physical strength can resist. He can continue not to eat for fifteen days (Situ Qi's conversation with a reporter from a certain newspaper seems to be a "strange person"). Unfortunately, no one asked him to perform publicly, and he ended up as a "mentally ill person." He himself is suffering from a terrible disease.</p>
<p>This kind of official Fu who is not afraid of death ultimately failed. I think that other than this Mr. Situ Qi, I am afraid that it is impossible to find any real evidence to prove that human beings are not afraid of death. In fact, "fear of death" is not a "sin." Even the emperor asks for the "elixir of immortality," and a small gangster opens his head to grab food in order to live. However, because they want to "live," they cook children, which is inevitably bloody. Moreover, it is a big question whether eating dead children can cure leprosy.</p>
<p>However, in this world, there are many people who "kill" because they want to "live," and they always kill hundreds or thousands, as if there is a "population explosion" in this world. In comparison, Peng Chi and Tan Gu seem to be excusable, especially since they killed a "child corpse."</p>
<p>I really don't know when this world will stop killing. I also suspect that the "fate" of those small lives that are "encouraged to reproduce" seems to have committed some kind of inauspicious star.</p>
<h3>Plan for Submarine to Explore the Arctic Under the Ice</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>Sir Hubert Wilkins, an American explorer, is currently organizing a grand plan to explore the Arctic from underwater. People in London are paying close attention to this matter. Mr. Wilkins had a submarine built, which was originally scheduled to depart this spring. Whether it can be done depends on whether the submarine can be built in time, or it may have to be postponed for a year, which is not known. According to the current situation, the required engine and the steel needed for the submarine may not be delivered within four months, but the factory undertaking the construction is currently working hard to rush the construction. After everything is complete, it will only take two and a half months to build the submarine.</p>
<p>If Mr. Wilkins decides to depart this year, he must test the submarine before May 1, and then depart from Si Guan Zi Baoqin around July 1 to head to the Arctic, so as not to miss the best time for Arctic exploration. Furthermore, in the past three months, all prices have risen by at least 35%. In the past, the funds he prepared for each expedition must be 50% more than the actual number. The cost of this expedition is estimated to require 20,000 pounds, which is already a large number. If prices continue to rise, and if he cannot raise the increased expenses for a while, the important matter that he regards as immediately implemented may have to be postponed until next year.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wilkins: "This is the safest of all my planned exploration works. People think that we will be trapped by ice, which is an unclear understanding of the Arctic situation. The dangerous elements this time are far less than the time in 1931 when we took the thirteen-year-old American old submarine 'Nautilus' to Antarctica. Ordinary submarines are very different from the submarines I am currently building. I would like to get a good ship so that I can let others take over and carry out the planned work. The submarine in my mind is extremely convenient, but the comfort is probably extremely small. When it is submerged underwater, it weighs 210 tons, is 74 feet long, 14 feet wide, and has a square keel that is 2 feet wide. The hull is made of fine steel that is 7/8 inch thick, which is unbreakable. The depth of submersion is less than 50 feet. Everything is as simple as possible, because this boat is actually just an empty shell, which only contains one engine, one generator, one propulsion motor, and one large storage battery. There is no decoration on the deck, and there is no special decoration or accessories in the room. All are scientific equipment. There is also no submerged rudder or periscope in the boat, and there are no auxiliary machines at all. When we are on the surface of the water, we can use wireless electricity, about 12 hours a day. When we are submerged in the water, we can use high power to contact 600 miles away. When we leave Si Guan Zi Baoqin, we will travel an average of 50 miles per day until we reach the White Sea. I plan to stay in the Arctic for several days, and then head to Ellesmere Island to determine whether the land that Perry and Macmillan believed they saw exists. Dr. Kirk also took photos of the land. That area has been visited by aviation explorers three times before and after, but all failed. It is really dangerous to survey this area by plane, because the ice there is completely different from the ice in Antarctica. If you land on the ice, the ice will easily break. Surface ships cannot reach within hundreds of miles of this area, only submarines can reach it. Exploring with submarines is not as difficult as ordinary people expect. We will be driving under the ice and can emerge on the surface of the water in the middle of the floating ice at any time. We can see as far as 50 yards away. We don’t feel cold there. The ice, whether good or bad, is only fourteen or five feet thick. Arctic travelers also say that the average thickness of the ice is only between one and two feet. I think it would take two months to reach by ordinary methods, but it would only take about two weeks by submarine. We have a lot of work along the way, such as recording the depth of the sea, studying the composition of the water, investigating animals and plants, and measuring suction. These things have become increasingly important in the scientific world. Magnetic observation is also an important item. In short, we will conduct various polar investigations that have been done before, and several other investigations. We will carry out these many tasks in greater comfort and convenience. As for the personnel in the boat, there will be a total of seven of us. I have not yet selected them, but it is not difficult to get them, because more than 4,000 people have written to apply. It must be known that our submarines are not as complicated as ordinary submarines, so driving is not difficult. In addition, we only need to take care of two hatches, and all the arrangements are very simple, so very little physical labor is used. However, our work is certainly continuous. When under ice or water, our propulsion will be limited to 12 hours a day. People talk about this matter and feel it is very dangerous, but they forget that there is a wide area of water near the Arctic, and the Arctic is also like this at a certain time. Based on my previous experience on the 'Nautilus,' I dare say that this organized expedition can be regarded as the safest of all I have ever undertaken."</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins is very optimistic about the difficulties he is currently encountering, and hopes to decide soon whether to depart this year or next year. But in any case, this matter must be done. Mr. Wilkins said sincerely: "I have been planning this matter for a long time. Since Bishop Chester John Wilkins first raised this question, it has been delayed for 387 years. Now that I have seen it, I cannot but do it."</p>

<h3>Lucky Child</h3>
<p>— Hong Fu</p>
<p>Xiao Bao is the only child of the Liu family. Because his family is wealthy, he has been spoiled by his parents since he was born. His clothes and food are especially exquisite, and he always eats sweets all day long. But although Xiao Bao's upbringing is so superior, his development is not very healthy. He is already four years old this year, but he is yellow and thin! His teeth often hurt! It often causes his parents to worry.</p>
<p>The Wu family's child—Xiao Mao, his family is only a middle-class family, and he has not had that superior life; but his development is very fast and very healthy. He is not yet two years old this year, but he can walk a lot of roads and can bite hard food. When people see how strong and cute he is, they call him a lucky child. In fact, there is nothing else to it. It's just because Xiao Mao's parents have been feeding Xiao Mao "Jia Le Calcium" chocolate candy since last year. This kind of candy contains nourishing ingredients, so it can achieve such an effect.</p>
<p>Children who often eat "Jia Le Calcium" from Wuzhou Pharmacy can become strong and lucky children.</p>
<h3>Dog Skin Peddler</h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>That peddler shouted along the road:</p>
<p>"Dog skins for winnowing baskets!"</p>
<p>In the desolate village, shrouded in a deep silence, under the leaden sky, the northwest wind blew from time to time. The shadows of dusk closed the doors of every house. In the twilight, the cold wind spread its wings, and the farm animals pulled the slow two-wheeled cart, strings of intermittent bell sounds drifting from afar.</p>
<p>"Dog skins for winnowing baskets, winnowing baskets for money!"</p>
<p>The peddler stretched out his voice as he shouted. He had a tall and upright body, with a cat-skin winter hat with four pieces sewn together on his head. Many tiny white spots floated on the reed-like fluff. He wore a baggy, deep blue coarse cloth robe. His two long legs walked forward with a goose-like gait. Soon, he turned into a small alley. From under a corner of the wall, a dog came to his side, sniffed him once, and then, startled, raised its head and barked as if beaten. The skin peddler ignored it and stopped under the large overhanging eaves of an old residence. A window on the wall was pushed open, and an old woman leaned out, shouting in a sharp voice:</p>
<p>"Hey, the dog skin buyer!"</p>
<p>Then, the peddler looked around in the darkness and said:</p>
<p>"Whose house is it?"</p>
<p>The thin old woman beckoned him to her door, turned around, and sent out a large spotted dog's skin from the window. He took it and gently stroked it with his palm. The fur, like a small plush rug, slanted and shimmered with curved light. He stroked it with his hand, feeling soft and fluffy, smooth and lovable. Then, he rubbed the black and white fur against his cheek, stretched out his arm, and looked at it carefully with a tilted face before asking:</p>
<p>"Two winnowing baskets?"</p>
<p>"Two winnowing baskets plus two strings of cash!"</p>
<p>"That's too expensive!"</p>
<p>"This is a big spotted dog that we raised for four years. In the first month, those wild cubs stole the dried dates we were drying behind our back door. When our hired hand ran up, it bit a child's leg. The next morning, those rabbit bastards threw it a cooked wild turnip. It took one bite and the dog rolled around howling. That night, all of its teeth fell out. That's when my son skinned it. This skin has been tanned and is guaranteed not to leak oil. Feel it..."</p>
<p>"Alright, I'll give you one more string of cash."</p>
<p>The thin old woman took the money, held two willow winnowing baskets, turned around, and closed the black door panel.</p>
<p>The dog skin peddler lovingly hung the dog skin at the front of his carrying pole, looked up at the night sky filled with dark clouds. It was going to snow again. He walked along the small path frozen with mud, shouting again and again:</p>
<p>"Dog skins for winnowing baskets!"</p>
<p>Dim lights lit up in the windows of every house. Dogs barked mournfully. The night dyed the countryside with a frozen black.</p>

<p>Entering and leaving the Grand View Garden diligently. The maidens are all equally graceful. Only Qingwen's delicate weeping posture stands out. Her nature is harmonious and her intentions are tender. She deeply wins the love of the Yihong Gongzi (Master of Yihong Courtyard). Every word and action delights him. Her ignorant cough turns into a serious illness. Medicine and stones are ineffective and unnatural. She is haggard and often sleepless. She keeps her illness a secret from her master. She is skillful with needles and thread, with ingenious talent. The cloak with peacock gold threads is torn and cannot be worn. She, in one night's effort, completes the patching. From then on, the burden becomes unbearable. Her beautiful face is short-lived, gone in an instant. The Gongzi's life is ill-fated, his intestines about to break. He secretly makes a hibiscus pouch by the lamp. He sighs once and sheds two tears. In the earthen mound, your life is ill-fated. Under the red gauze window, I am without destiny. Drawing out the tears of the Xiaoxiang concubine. She silently watches from across the window. Burning incense with a flower petal. Presenting a cup on the three-foot lonely grave. Romantic figures are often talented. Clouds and rain are merciless, the moon is not full. Suffering from the endless pain of life and death.</p>

Rowing a boat to see grandpa. Grandpa says I'm really clean. Blue cloth shirt. Calculated flat and dry. Two hands. Washed as white as lotus roots. (4) Little younger sister. Rowing a boat to see the fair. Ten small boats in a row. Don't compete to be first. Competing to be first messes up the class. Don't stop. Stopping blocks the way for pedestrians.</p>

<p>Movies</p>
<h3>Minxin News</h3>
<p>Minxin's first production, "Mother's Love," already has high box office records everywhere. This time, "The Door of Flesh and Spirit" has finished at the Suzhou Public Hall, and the total income has exceeded "Mother's Love" by one time, which shows the audience's enthusiastic welcome to the film. The film will be shown in various places soon. Its special style, psychological depiction, heart-stirring mood, and tortuous realistic story will all give the audience a deep understanding.</p>
<p>"New Humanity" recently borrowed the Shanghai's grandest and magnificent Metropolitan Ballroom to shoot a dance scene, and the results were extremely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Since Li Keng started acting, although the roles he has played have different personalities each time, most of them have been poor children. Now Bu Wancang has specially written a play for Li Keng, in which he appears as a little gentleman, co-starring with Lin Chuchu. This film will be one of Minxin's productions this year and is tentatively titled "Little Gentleman."</p>
<p>The greatest scene in "New Humanity," the mass grave, will depart for Qingjiangpu soon to shoot. The actors include Lin Chuchu, Li Keng, Wang Guilin, etc. Other temporary actors, six or seven hundred people, will be recruited locally.</p>
<p>In addition, in "New Humanity," the boat scene of Liang Saizhu, Hu Rong, and Dai Yanwan, although only a few shots, will also be filmed in Yangzhou in order to achieve the best possible shooting effect. The location shooting team will depart at the same time as the Qingjiangpu location shooting.</p>
<p>Bu Wancang praises the acting performance of the newly discovered child star Li Xi to everyone he meets, and those who watched the trial performance of the excerpts the other day were all surprised and speechless.</p>
<h3>Cathay Screens "A Soulful Melody"</h3>

<h3>Da Guangming Star Sunday Additional Early Showing</h3>
<p>American Navy Worship Service</p>
<p>Will be Moved to Cathay</p>
<p>For the past two years, the Da Guangming Cinema has lent its venue to the American Navy for worship services every Sunday morning. It is now heard that the theater authorities, due to the extreme crowding of the audience at the two afternoon screenings on Sundays, have decided that, starting this Sunday, an additional screening will be added every Sunday at 10:30 AM. The film shown will be the same as the film shown in the afternoon, and the ticket price will be 60 cents for both the balcony and the orchestra seats. This move will indeed provide a great deal of convenience to movie fans in Shanghai. As for the American Navy worship service, it will be moved to the Cathay Grand Theater on Xiafei Road as before.</p>
<h3>Era Cinema March Issue Published</h3>
