<h3>葛家牌樓黃港之敵被我襲後路迫擊</h3>
<p>葑村塘一帶全日砲火籠罩　戰况猛烈敵軍遭痛擊受創</p>
<p>大塲以北、戰事仍在激烈進行之中、我軍陣綫、異常鞏固、傾全力進犯大塲之敵、在葛家牌樓·黃港·兪家宅·等處、被我軍猛擊後、受創重大、不敢續進、經二日二夜之　血戰、敵軍顯巳疲備不支、昨晨四時半、敵軍又企圖突圍、向我軍猛犯、血戰復又展開、我軍奮勇向前、將其撲滅、在敵軍火力集中之下、前仆後繼、直向前衝、將突圍之敵、擊斃無數、敵軍經此痛擊、仍向原處退去、公路以西、葛家牌樓黃港之敵、仍在我軍重圍之中、茲將昨日全日以迄夜晚之戰況、分述如次、</p>
<p>幾度進犯終不得逞</p>
<p>中央社江灣隨軍記者二十一日晚九時三十分報吿、蕰藻浜南岸沿滬太公路及葑封村塘兩側、整日籠罩於砲火之中、拂曉起、敵機結隊而來、在我陣地投彈甚多、黃港方面之敵、自晨至夜、不斷向我湖裏宅·蘇家宅·盛家宅·來犯、我嚴陣以待、見敵行近、卽以機槍掃射、敵砲火雖猛、但我扼守原陣、不為所動、至午時、敵以坦克車多輛、掩護步兵向我公路西側朱家宅·陳家宅·之綫猛撲、我警戒綫一度被突破、旋經奮力衝鋒、終將敵逐去、恢復原陣、公路東側之蘇家橋宅·膏荏橋宅·以至陸宅·沈家灣·周程宅·全綫、敵由西北兩方來犯、亦激戰終日、惟我陣地鞏固、戒備嚴密、敵終無隙可乘、</p>
<p>我軍反攻勢如破竹</p>
<p>軍息、葛家牌樓黃港一帶之敵、經我堵截、已無進展能力、敵正圖在葛家牌樓構築工事、以憑固守、我乘敵勢未穩、卽於昨午反攻、由左翼抄擊、沿葑村塘之南岸突進、截其後路、其時敵機雖活動異常、惟我部隊均於預定之時間、結集於張家樓下、號令旣下、我軍咸奮不顧身、浴血衝鋒、緊迫敵陣、我軍頗佔優勢、</p>
<h3>江灣閘北我軍出擊斃敵</h3>
<p>中央社閘北隨軍記者二十二日晨一時廿五分報吿、昨日我軍各路反攻、江灣方面、先於午後三時卅分、由賀家巷·東宅·八字橋·與體育會路各處、以小部向市中心區及泗涇球塲分頭遊擊、敵軍見我前進、卽隱匿而去、惟坦克車數輛來往阻我前進、我軍卽間道而行、至六時許、有數隊沿吉浦而進、沿途斃敵兵六十餘、譚家宅·水電路·胡家木橋·柳營路各處、我亦派小部隊進擊六三花園及愛國女學之敵、七時半砲聲密集、總攻開始、我砲兵射擊準確　　屢中敵軍要害、惟敵避不迎戰、故各處僅有前哨之接觸、江灣路上亦有敵坦克軍活動、至九時半、我軍一度由八字橋衝近六三花園殲敵後、仍行退回、與敵相持、廣東街東賓興路口、我亦以小部隊衝至北四川路向敵擾擊、敵則深伏於工事後、以機關槍還擊、當時密集之槍聲、震驚全市、約持續兩小時、卽趨沉寂、我已達擾擊目的卽撤回原防、</p>
<h3>我空軍來滬助戰</h3>
<p>敵兵房彈庫均遭我轟炸</p>
<p>昨晚十時三十五分、我空軍來滬助戰、飛經浦江上空敵艦先用探照燈在空中搜尋、旋卽以高射砲轟擊、約三分鐘卽停止、至十一時四十五分、砲聲再作、較第一次猛烈、高射機關槍聲亦連續不絕、惟已不如往日之密、我機目的並不在轟炸敵艦、故卽安然飛去、至今晨一時十分、敵艦又起一度庸擾、但砲聲亦殊寥落、想敵軍巳不勝浪費砲彈之負担矣、</p>
<p>平凉路眉州路日商上海纺織公司第四廠職員宿舍、自戰事發生後、卽歸敵軍應用、作為兵房、此外並將平凉路齊齊哈爾路職員宿舍、作為軍械貯藏處、昨晚我空軍於來滬助戰之餘、曾於今晨零點十二分前往眉州路上空向敵兵房轟炸、頓卽爆炸起火燃燒甚烈、至今晨一時三十四分、始被撲滅、敵軍死傷甚衆、至今晨一時左右、該齊齊哈爾路敵軍軍械庫、又被我空軍轟炸中的、起火燃燒、且有大批軍火着火爆烈、聲震四野、直至二時四十分左右、爆炸力稍衰、方得着手撲救、至今晨四時許、火燄尚未全熄、敵軍損失奇重、</p>
<h3>大塲絕對穩固</h3>
<p>日來因葛家牌楼宅及黃港之陷入敵手、大塲方面、受到重大威脅、而大塲之安危、更有關江灣閘北戰局、故日來讀報者、對於大塲情勢、甚為關切、本報記者昨夜赴前綫、叩問某高級指揮官、承吿一小小村落之得失、實無關宏旨、現黑大黄宅一带之敵、雖深入黄港附近、實際上大塲形勢、並不如想像之嚴重、總之大塲絕對穩固、現葛家牌樓之敵、受我正面及左右兩側之三面包圍、陣地愈縮愈狹、已成為一極狹隘之尖角形、正面受我侯家庫·盛家宅·界涇宅之攻擊、左面受我墻門頭宅至楊灣宅之壓迫、右面受我馬橋宅·季項宅·沿公路側擊、敵雖亟亟構築工事、但侷處牛角尖中、無異自陷絕境、昨夜經我激烈之反攻、不難殲滅、某長官又謂、該處我有極堅固之壕塹、雄厚之兵力、敵軍卽使進犯大塲、决難得逞、曾國藩云、“紮硬塞、打死仗”、我軍現在卽採此種戰略、戰事前途、絕對樂觀云、</p>

<h3>楊樹浦敵機七架證實被我炸燬</h3>
<p>我空軍巧隨敵機建奇功　外人徵實日當局不否認</p>
<p>大陸報云、十月十四日之夜中國飛機駕駛員某氏、曾巧施計謀、在楊樹浦日飛行塲、炸毀日機七架、此事雖日當局嚴守秘密、但已經可靠之外人觀察家徵實、是日薄暮後、本埠砲火連天之際、日飛機四架、開其機上之燈、飛回根據地、為中國飛機一架所見、亦開其機上之燈、而加入日機隊中飛行、日機因是以為該機乃屬自己方面、未加注意、旣抵飛行塲、該機亦佯作降落狀、迨日機四架全行降地、乃擲炸彈兩枚而飛去、日機察覺後、急發警報、於是浦江中各日艦齊發高射砲、滬地居民、當憶是日七時左右、高射砲聲隆隆震耳也、但該中國飛機、是時已遠離上海矣、楊樹浦日飛行塲、因受浦東中國砲隊之威脅、遷至吳淞之說、已由外人視察家徵實、昨晨新聞訪員、以此事詢諸日海軍發言人、據答、虛實可自求之、</p>
<h3>敵軍官死傷已證實</h3>

<h3>敵軍動態</h3>
<p>敵部隊怯戰</p>
<p>羅店西北老丹宅秦宅張家村一帶之敵人、近已換防、其新到之部隊、紀律甚差、每經我飛機及大砲擊中時、輒大聲呼號、紛亂不堪、且怯弱異常、晝夜發槍亂射、以自壯其膽、惟其機關槍手似頗沉着云、</p>

<h3>中國之經濟力量足抗戰兩年有餘</h3>
<p>縱上海華北失守仍將繼續奮鬬　戰時經濟我已準備不日將實行　宋子文與外籍訪員談話</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、中國銀行總裁宋子文近接見倫敦每日導報訪員、與談中日戰事甚久、宋稱、縱淞滬與黃河以北各省全行淪陷、國民政府亦决不與日本休戰、中國之經濟力、足以抗戰兩年、於必要時、尚可延長、上海若陷落、則將視爲僅屬此次求生存之大戰之起點、縱南京不保、亦將繼續奮鬬如故、假使今有休戰之可能、吾人已不在蘆溝橋抵抗、且已早在該處議和、何必待至華北數省失守乎、宋氏承認南京若與上海實業根據地約佔中國海關收入半數之來源隔斷、政府將受一重大打擊、而須在内地組織新的經濟根據地、與上海之方式大不相同、但渠信中國人民皆凖備忍受調整之大震動、中國應付戰爭艱困之能力、業經試騐、而不可限量、人民對於政府之一切需求、無不樂於供給、蓋全國今已團結一致、堅決從事求生存之戰爭也、宋氏次述及第八路軍在晋北抵抗武器精備之敵軍、已疊獲勝利、繼謂往日共黨在華南維持長期之抵抗、足爲中國人民有以弱勝强、以寡勝多能力之明證、共黨僅以江西半省爲根據地、能與政府軍五十萬周旋、此足徵全國動員、共赴一的、其能力爲何如矣、訪員問此次戰爭、範圍廣大、必需大改革與大犧牲而後可、中央政府其已凖備取應行之嚴峻步驟、組織貫澈性質之戰時經濟否、宋答、當已凖備、或不日將實行之、訪員又問中國遲遲未取抗戰到底之堅毅步驟、使許多人以爲中央政府仍開啟與日本談判之門戶、中國迄今尚不與日本正式斷絕經濟關係、且未與日本斷絕外交關係、未沒收日人之財產、未定遠大計畫、利用國人實業與銀行之富力、而謀將其活動之主要地移至內地新根據地、其故可得聞乎、宋答、渠信此皆爲時間之事、且僅須出以權謀、不必凖備作决議也、（例如九月份日本輸　入上海之物品、較之七月份已减少百分之九九六·六、）至於第四點、現已日見實現、尤其爲關於戰爭之根本實業、如上海之五金業、今大部分已移入內地矣、宋氏至是復涉及一般人對於中國作戰到底之懷疑、謂中國之政治統一、有賴於繼續抗戰、假使政府僅因華北或上海之淪陷、而以爲應屈服者、則政治統一、將不可能、今日華軍、士氣甚盛、今苟作休戰之思、則軍心必將渙散、防衛松滬之戰役、已犧牲甚多之生命、且參與者有各省之軍隊、今日談及訓和、必不爲前綫將士所樂聞、宋氏不願宜露中國目前所需之戰費、惟稱此諸日本渺乎其小、渠估計日本今至少須日費七十五萬鎊、約合日金一千萬元、宋氏並不輕視日本應付困難之能力、蓋在國家淪於危境之時、必能喚起其人民作痛苦之犧牲也、或謂日本經濟崩潰、爲期不遠、宋氏對於此說不予附和、惟謂日本苟有此日、終必在中國之前發現也、宋氏又謂國民政府深悉在戰爭之初步階段中、中國之損失與失敗、必遠逾日本、但不經黑夜、不達朗晨、中國抗戰彌久、地位彌强、日本則地位彌弱、國民政府對於此點、深信弗疑、訪員乃問外傳蘇聯飛機八百架已運抵蘭州、此說是否可靠、宋答、渠亦聞此說覺甚有趣、但不能徵實耳、訪員又問及日軍佔據包頭、深入鄂多斯旗事、中蘇之交通、將因以隔斷、關係匪淺、宋謂此問可參閱精細之地圖、卽能得其答語、訪員又稱、外傳外蒙復將內響中國、北地戰事或可因以有新發展、宋氏對於此問、無以爲答、但謂日本在內蒙所獲軍事上之勝利、若長此深進則種種不利之因素亦將隨以發展、蓋中日戰爭延長、日本内國與國際之地位將减弱、一旦與蘇聯正面衝突、將不堪設想矣、惟渠信蘇聯對於遠東危機之决議、若遷延過久、則贊力必甚大也、</p>
<h3>在轟炸中來去</h3>
<p>— 郭沫若</p>
<p>十三</p>
<p>警報解除後；汽車又開來了。汽車夫異常的高與，在車裏連連地向我說，我們的高射砲眞打得好，眞打得好！城裏所打落了的兩架飛機，他也是看見了的。</p>
<p>一街的人都是笑逐顏開的，那笑中自然有從恐佈裏解放出來了的安心，而更加不用說的是含有眞打得好，眞打得好的歡喜。這歡喜把我們民族的感情打成了一片，我們要把這民族的歡喜匯成哄笑，轟落下敵人的一切的飛機！視死如歸的歡笑的轟炸，這是我們的至精銳的武器，敵人，你盡量的來吧！</p>
<p>到了約定地因爲時間已過，汪先生留下了一位秘書，吿訴汽車夫更開到某地去。</p>
<p>在客廳裏坐候得沒一分鐘光景，汪先生進門來了，老遠開着跑步：跑來和我握手，幾幾乎要把我擁把着的一樣。</p>
<p>汪先生的精神很好，但比武漢時代是消瘦得多了。</p>
<p>汪先生說，大家曉得你來了，都很高興。剛才在開會議，大家都期待着會開完後可以和你見面，但可惜警報的時候太長，所以都散開了。</p>
<p>汪先生又說到我要回上海的話來，於是我便知道，岳軍是把我要走的消息報吿了的。</p>
<p>談了有將近一個鐘頭的話，汪先生問我；已經見過公博沒有？我說，還不曾見過，正想和他見面。</p>
<p>汪先生說；那嗎好，你就留在我這兒吃午飯，我打電話去呌公博來，我們一道再說。</p>
<p>我說；巳經和孫哲生先生約過，要在午前去看他。午飯也有先約。</p>
<p>汪先生說；那嗎好，我打電話去問公博，讓他約定一個時間和地點。</p>
<p>汪先生進去打電話去了，起初轉來說，公博要來看我，問我住在什麽地方。我吿訴了。但汪先生再轉來時，郤說，公博約我三點鐘到他往的地方去</p>
<p>離開十二時已經不遠了，我便告辭了，去訪問孫哲生先生。</p>
<p>哲生先生也問到了我的關於甲骨文和金文的研究上來。在上海曾經聽見吳經熊博士說過，哲生先生曾買過我的“殷契粹編”來送他，他郤把我的“屈原”和浮士德”來轉贈了。古器物學的研究，在中國似乎有成爲一般趣味的傾向，但我自己回到中國來僅僅祗有兩個月，對於那些研究就好像隔了兩個世紀，這在我自己或許怕是一種危磯。</p>
<p>在陳設中看見有一個靑銅器，是有蓋的匜。把蓋揭開來看，蓋頂和器底都有銘，作器者是“浮公之孫公父宅”（公父是字，宅乃名。）這個器皿，記得在“寗壽鑑古或“西淸古鑑”上紀錄過。器之如匜而有蓋者，王國維以爲是飲酒的兕觥。但這個公父宅匜旣大而有蓋，銘文也明明說是匜，而且器和銘都不會是贋品，足見王國維的兕觥說也有點靠不住。古者匜與盤必相埒，匜是盛水的器皿，無論盛熱水或冷水，都不妨其有蓋。匜不常有蓋，我看是說不過去的。大約有蓋而小的匜也可以盛酒，古人則稱之爲兕觥吧。</p>
<p>因爲綫報的頻繁在哲生先生那兒竟由十二點鐘捱到了三點過鐘。談了不少的話，會了不少的人，公博也是在這兒會看的。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>敵人的軍事企圖</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>就全般的戰事形勢看來。敵人因爲嘗夠了我軍堅强抵抗的苦味。受到了國際形勢的壓迫。已經把主要的軍事目標集中在山西方面。要用全力奪取了太原。完成黃河以北軍事控制的局勢。然後脅迫我國接受屈辱的和平。至于上海一綫。則實在爲了“皇軍”的面子關係。不得不煞費苦心戰下去。這方面敵人的企圖就是急于要攻佔大塲。迫得江灣閘北的我軍撤退爭回些以前所丟的面子。一到這地步也許就巴不得罷休了。</p>
<p>敵人這一種打算當然是不能實現的幻想。山西方面自從大軍增援以後我們迭次獲得了大勝。敵軍已經勢窮力蹙了上海方面敵軍五次總攻。都遭慘敗。顯然也不易再進。况且我軍事領袖迭次聲明過抗戰到底的决心。敵人卽使偶獲局部的勝利要罷休。我們也是不肯饒過他們的。</p>
<p>可是我們卻不能不指出敵人目下縮小戰爭範圍的企圖是毒辣的。敵人明知戰爭持久下去。於他們不利。要用速戰的手段來結束戰爭。這雖不能使我國上當。但對於有的第三國的心理。郤是能夠相當迎合的。</p>

<h3>抗戰時期的民主問題</h3>
<p>— 章乃器</p>
<p>近來有些人一聽到民主兩個字，便立刻要想到下面的兩個問題：</p>
<p>一·抗戰時期正需要一個有力量的政府，為甚麼還談民主呢？</p>
<p>二·抗戰時期正需要擁護領袖，為甚麼還談民主呢？</p>
<p>對於這兩個問題，我們可以給他們一個極簡單的答復：民主就是民權，這一點孫中山先生已經對我們說過了；我們目下的抗戰，並不是從天上掉下來的，祇不過是國民革命的一個新階段，是三民主義進一步的實行。那末，誰又能說抗戰時期就不需要民主呢？但，我們不願意提出這樣簡單的理由，我們要進一步研究這兩個問題的內容。</p>
<p>孫先生在民權主義裹，曾經把政權和治權分析得很清楚。</p>
<p>他說：</p>
<p>“想造成的新國家，是要把國家的政治大權，分開成兩個　　一個是政權，要把這個大權，完全交到人民的手內，要人民有充分的政權可以直接去管理國事。這個政權，便是民權。一個是治權，要把這個大權，完全交到政府的機關之內，要政府有很大的力量，治理全國事務。這個治權，便是政府權。”</p>
<p>他又說：</p>
<p>“政府的威力可以發展，人民的權力也可以擴充。有了這種政權和治權，才可以達到美國學者的目的，造成萬能政府，為人民謀幸福。”</p>
<p>這兩段話證明，民權的發展，不但不會降低政府的威力，反而可以增加政府的威力。歷史所給與我們敎訓，也只是有民主制度能夠澈底掃除政治上經濟上一切封建割據的勢力，完成一個眞正統一的國家，建立起來一個有力量的政府。歐美各國近數十年間民主制度所造成政治上的糾紛和政府基礎的脆弱，並不是民主政治的先天弱點，而是民主政治的後人病態。這是因為議會漸漸的變成□□資本家的工具，不能反映大多數人的公意；資產階級內部的矛盾，才會反映到議會裹，而大多數人民一致的意見，反而表現不出來。我們且看看，各國在推翻封建制度建立民主制度之後，專制的淫威是消滅了，政府的力量却只有增加。一個操生殺予奪大權的帝王，表面上看起來是“不可一世”然而那裹能動員全國的力量？到是一個民主國家的政府，雖然平時有議會的牽制，但是國力的增長和國力的動員，却絕對不是封建政府所能企及。我們再看看，近年來有些國家的人民大衆漸漸的覺悟了，漸漸的能選出代表自已利益的代議士了，政治的基礎便比較的穩定起來。要之，民主政治暴露弱點的時候，便是議會不能代表大多數人民的時候，便是民主變成虛偽民主的時候，民主本身會有什么罪惡呢？　　　　說到我國的民主問題，抗戰以前的民主呼聲和抗戰以後是不同的。抗戰以前我們談民主，是要政府執行人民公意，抵抗侵略；抗戰以後我們談民主，是要政府集中國力，動員民力，抗戰到底，以取得最後的勝利。老實說，目下民衆所顧慮的，不是中央權力的過大或者領袖權力的集中，而是怕中央的權力不能及於地方，領袖的意旨不能達於下層，以致削弱了抗戰的力量。我曾經說過：目下“上下一心”是做到了，中層卻還有部分的問題。人民要抗戰，領袖已經發動抗戰，人民要抗戰到底，領袖也要抗戰到底，人民要動員自己參加抗戰，領袖也說非動員全國人民參加抗戰不能取得最後的勝利。領袖已經完全執行人民的公意，從領袖和人民的關係來說：那可說是再民主不過了。但是，中層却存在着少數的障碍物！　　　　從軍事來講，華北戰爭初期的失利，誰都知道是少數地方軍人還存在着封建割據的意識，上不能執行中央的意旨，下違反了士兵抗戰的要求，以致坐誤戎機，迭失名城。倘使沒有這中層的障碍，中央意旨和士兵要求能打成一片,何至於此？我們也知道，在這偉大的抗戰潮流中，一切腐败齷齪的物事都要被冲洗得乾乾凈凈，一切障碍物都要被淘汰以盡，但是，用玉石俱焚喪師失地的方式來冲洗淘汰，對於國力的消耗實在太大了！　　　　其次，在政治方面，貪污頇顢頇的官僚風氣，壟斷把持的閥閱意識，和播弄是非的政客技倆，依然到處遺留着：甚至認賊作父的敵探漢奸，也不斷的發現出來。無疑的，過去十年間對內對外的妥洽政策，曾經使許多惡腐習氣重新抬頭，同時，許多惡腐分子，也乘機混到政治機構裹來。他們有的欺上蒙下，有的諂上虐下；一面陽奉陰違，阻碍中央政策的執行，一面狐假虎威，削弱人民對於政府的信仰·萬一軍事上受了頓挫，重新提出妥洽主張，企圖動搖抗戰的，恐怕也就是這一班人。　　　　復其次，在社會方面，新舊土劣把持後方工作及保甲制度，以為個人乘機漁利的工具的，也所在都有。如制裁漢奸及抽調壯丁，便在許多地方成為土劣敲詐平民的口實·他們為了要掩蓋自己的劣跡，便不能不壓迫民衆的抬頭。國家在抗戰時期中如何迫切需要民衆的奮起，那裹是這一　　所能了解所肯計及？這一班自私自利不知羞恥的棍徒，在敵兵壓境的時候要重新為了自己的私利變成漢奸傀儡，自然都是意中事。　　　　這種種中層的障碍物，上面纂竊了政府的治權，下面掠奪了人民的政權。我們現在要求民主，便是要他們把治權還給政府，把政權還給人民。就政府和人民的關係來講，我們希望政府能夠肅清一切欺上蒙下諂上虐下的惡腐分子，造成一個上下一心的局面；就中央和地方的關係來講，我們希望中央能夠肅清一切封建割據的殘餘意識，以造成一個眞正的統一國家。為要達到這種希望，我們認為政府必須先給人民以更多的民主權利，一面使人民可以自動組織起來保護自己的利益，同時貢獻自己的力量；一面使輿論能成為民衆的喉舌，足以暴露一切巧取豪奪欺壓平民的劣跡，糾正一切把持壟斷腐敗顢頇的風氣。這種任務的澈底執行，專靠上面一個雷霆萬鈞之力，是不够的，即使布置一個偵查網，恐怕也收效甚微。一定下面有民衆的力量做基礎，上面的力量才能發揮得出來。惡腐分子所怕的，並不是掛一漏萬的上面的制裁，而是萬目睽睽的民衆的制裁。</p>
<p>偉大的抗戰是整個民族的試金石，也是每一個人的試金石。誰愛國，誰不愛國，誰進步，誰腐敗，就從他們對於抗戰的熱情當中充分表現出來。我們在這個大潮流當中，用不着有什麼黨派意識，也用不着有什麼階級成見，因為，民族的利害終超過任何團體的利害，而亡國奴的痛苦畢竟是超經濟的。更具體點說：我們用不着過分重視一個人的過去歷史和經濟基礎，而只須注意他在今天的表現；一個軍閥參加了抗戰，一個土劣發動了後援，我們就應該立刻引為同志。陣綫太容易劃分了，一切籠统的“反對”“打倒”口號，現在都不需要了。只要大家都能化除成見，聯合一切愛國的人，同時破除情面，制裁一切自私的人，中層的障碍就可以很容易的掃除乾凈。</p>
<p>曆史上民主制度的實行，往往就在大潮流當中。我們現在上面有執行人民公意的領袖，中層有很多純良的幹部，下層還有意志統一的民衆；民主權利的開放和政府治權的提高，巳經變成不相抵觸不能分離的兩件事，還有什麼值得顧慮呢？難道“民主集權”四個字的涵義都會忘記了嗎？</p>
<p>總之，為要保證抗戰的最後勝利，我們需要一個萬能的政府，但是，一個萬能的政府，必須有偉大的民衆力量做基礎。抗戰時期的民主，目的就在提高民衆的力量，排除中層的障碍，使民衆和領袖打成一片，使中央和地方合成一體，以造成一個萬能的政府。</p>
<h3>戰時日本百態</h3>
<p>前言</p>
<p>申時社特訊、蘆溝橋事件發生後、本社記者即兼程赴日、昨日回滬、為期計三個月、日本始終在很緊張的戰時狀態之下、因日警監視記者行動、檢查記者信件、故在日本無通信之自由、今已回到祖國、於自由的行一個深呼吸之後、即執筆草此“戰時日本百態”、從政治社會各方面描書其動態、容可供關心戰時日本者之參考、</p>
<p>㊀為甚麼戰爭</p>
<p>日本為甚麼對中國戰爭、這是很容易解答的、日本要刦奪中國的富源、征服中國，以實現其大陸政策、</p>
<p>可是他們對世界各國却不便於這樣乾脆地講、所以不得不苦悶的尋求一些堂而皇之的理由、第一步是掩飾、“不擴大事件”、“局地解决”、及至事件擴大至上海、甚至召集第七十二次臨時　會、增加二十六萬的　　費的時候、　　節、　川、於是近衛也跟着軍部學步、高呼“　懲中國政府”了、</p>
<p>一方高呼“膺懲”、一方面又帶上了一副妙不可言的日本獨特的面具、說日本和中國戰爭的目的、是在要求中國的協力“提携”、並不要求“領土”、日本膺懲的對象是中國政府、不是中國人民、日本毋寗要替中國人民謀幸福、</p>
<p>這種離間的話、也許近衛及軍部各位　覺得說得很動聽　然而他們根本上並沒有看　看今日的中國政府與國民是否那樣容易離間、試看抗戰以後的中國南北各地的將領及全國民衆之熱烈擁護中央、殊死抗　、便可看出近衛等如何近視淺見　可憐、</p>
<p>關於這事、他們自國的外交界長老前　駐德大使　本多熊太郎Honda　KumalaroShiha　於芝公園的國民大會上、曾有峻烈的批評、他說“日本口口聲聲要替中國人民謀幸福、我以爲日本在替別國人民謀幸福之前、最好先使自國的人民有吃有穿、日本自身是一個窮困的國家　人民衣食所需、均仰給於中國、日本工業、最發達的是紡織、而在江南的日本紡織業、占日本全國紡織業百分之二十、每年可得贏餘上萬萬、日本國民身上所穿之汗衫·棉背心　裹褲·等、均係霑此贏餘之餘潤、但戰爭破壞了此巨大的利源、長期戰爭、日本國民靠甚麼來維持其衣食”、這眞是一針見血之論、可惜在極端的言論壓迫之下、敢於如此大聲疾呼者、直如鳳毛麟角、而本多氏之所論、若非記者親耳聽見、在報端决看不到、</p>
<p>用戰爭要求“提携”的奇妙理論、猶之一手打別人的耳光、一手要人家和他拉手做朋友、這除了聰明的日本人以外、任何國家民族均不能做、於是近衛求敎於三原則的作俑者廣田外相、討到了一個新法寶、說要剷除中國的赤化、他以為這次總可以嚇倒經濟帝國主義的各國了、然而這法寶似乎也並沒有多大效力、美國大總统在芝加哥的演說、擲以前觀望的態度、而對日軍之慘無人道的轟炸無防備的都市與非武裝的人民、與以非人道的考語、認日本對華之軍事行動、違反九國公約與凱洛格非戰公約、</p>
<p>這一下子、逼得日本露出原形了、十月六日外務省情報長部河相達夫　Tatsumo　Kawai對外國記者發表“爆彈”聲明　說世界為人類而設、正直而勤勉的人、有享受幸福生活之權利、托庇祖宗遺蔭擁有廣大資源、而慵懶怠惰、不肯開發者、應受淘汰、現世界資源分配不平均、有“持有者”與“無有者”之分、“無有者”為要求資源之平均分配除戰爭外、尚有何種手段可以解决、這聲明的乃是日本的眞正態度　你有、我沒有、你的要給我、不給我、我便打你、這便是日本對華戰爭的原因、這强盜式的供狀、博得外國記者的喝釆、說“你早這麼說、不就得了麼、我們現在纔明白日本的眞意、”</p>
<p>對於河相這圖窮而匕首現的聲明、引起內閣極大的不滿、十月八日閣議、遞相永井柳太郎嚴詞責問廣田情報部長發言何以如此輕率、正當英美對日關係緊張之際、這樣重要的聲明、竟不得閣議之諒解、而輕於發表、殊屬失當、閣員附和永井、紛紛責難廣田、廣田甚窘、近衛也說、“這位情報部長、眞糟糕得可以”、</p>
<p>㊁路透社與河相火併</p>
<p>日本有一份美國人辦的外字報　　　　、　得有　的　説、他説、中有這次戰爭、在軍事上日本取攻勢、但在國際宜傳上、則完全是守勢、而且被中國攻擊得體無完膚、做宣傳工作至少要有新聞學常識、按照新聞的慣例　Sensational的報道、照例排入最顯著的地位、以吸引讀者、而新聞最不歡迎的是更正的報道、且一般讀者也只是注意駭人聽聞的報道、而不留心那隨後的更正　這次中日事變、中國方面所供給的資料以及西洋記者由中國拍出的電報、俱係根據實地見聞暴露日軍不人道的行為、而日本所發的電報只一味地否認或更正中國與西洋記者的通信、作戰是在中國、其作戰的實相、中國及西洋記者係根據實地見聞而報告、讀者當然欣然置信而日本所發之否認的電報、則多由東京拍出、東京既非作戰所在地、日本又無一官吏一記者留居南京或其中國都市、然則日本有何材料否認中國或西洋記者的通信呢、</p>
<p>上面的社說、道破了日本宣傳的全貌、日本外務省情報部每週兩次接見外報記者、好像每次都是在那裹作否認或更正的工作、譬如九月二十二日、日機在南京·廣東·兩方面的大轟炸、路透社曾有異常詳盡的報告、拍至倫敦、各報均以此慘無人道的轟炸無防備的都市、炸死非戰鬥員二千人為大標題、引起英國朝野對日軍暴行致的憤慨、日情報部長河相、對此發出異想天開的聲明、說路透社在廣東並無特派記者、此消息係一廣東籍之中國人梁某所供給、顯然不可信、路透社東京特派員M·J·Cox　考可斯為此曾與河相當面衝突、考可斯正式通告同盟社及日本各報館、謂本特派員奉路透社總社命令、鄭重聲明廣東確有路透社特派員在、其人為英籍、曾任上海工部局中學教員多年、為精通中國事情之路透社幹部、日機炸死非戰鬥員一千名、係該特派員親眼所見、所謂梁某、路透社並無其人、</p>
<p>對於考可斯這强硬的逆襲、河相只有棄甲曳兵而走、蓋宣傳不根據事實、結果只有自己暴露其醜也</p>
<p>㊂戰時內閣强心針</p>
<p>目下日本政界所考慮的問題、已經不是戰爭、因為戰爭已經開始、政界上層所焦慮的問題是戰勝抑或戰敗的結果、以及如　收拾　後的問題、</p>
<p>於天地之間、縱然不敗、以今日中國國力之向上、抗戰之勇猛、國際關係之複雜、近衛也負不起收拾戰後時局的重任、於是早自為計、乃有臨時內閣參議之組織、</p>
<p>內閣參議、係網羅日本各派勢力的代表人物、口實的反映國民各階層之意見、解消一切的小乘的摩擦相尅、以收拾時局因為係各派勢力之揉合、便無異各派替近衛分擔政治上的責任、就近衛自身計、固不失為脆弱的內閣　錠强心針、然而七拼八湊的內閣參議、連平日冰炭不相容的宇垣·荒木·也拉在一起究竟能發生多大效力、甚屬疑問、且其人選如秋田淸·松岡洋右、報界對之　均有微辭、故內閣參議未成立之前、已有人問其鼎之重輕了、臨時內閣官制、已於十月十三日由樞密院本會議可决、十五日公布、其內容計兩條、第一、關於中國事變之重要國務、設內閣參議若干名、使之參與內閣籌劃、內閣參議由練達之士中簡拔敕命、第二、內閣參議、受國務大臣禮遇、</p>
<p>內閣參議之大選、由軍部選四名、（陸海兩部各二名）政界選三名、財界選二名、外交界選一名、合計十名、</p>
<p>陸軍方面、宇垣一成大將·荒木貞夫大將、</p>
<p>海軍方面，安保清種大將·末次信正大將、</p>
<p>政黨方面、民政黨總裁町田忠治·政友代行委員前田米藏無所屬秋田清、</p>
<p>財界方面、鄉誠之助·池田成彬、</p>
<p>外交方面松岡洋右、</p>
<p>朝日新聞十四日社說云、“內閣參議、並非作為合議體的諮問機關、受國務大臣待遇的各人、個別的參與內閣之籌劃、有缺乏政治的明朗性之虞、由於人選之如何與其視為國家機關、毋寗有首相個人私的機關之感、”又云、“現內閣出現、當時曾有人以近衛公爵之出馬為“最後法寶、”此次的內閣參與、在或種意味上言之、纔是眞的最後法寶、全體到齊的同時、有庫無存糧之感、”又云、“國民决不相信外交方面絕對信賴廣田外相、便可不必有任何補强工作、否則毋寗使人今而始發外交界無人之歏、較之內補强還必要的是外交陣之刷新興强化、”（第三段完、全文未完、待續、）</p>
<h3>市當局創辦平民兒童醫院</h3>
<p>孔夫人亦擇址籌辦一所　將來并擬施以相當教育</p>
<p>本市兪市長鑒於滬戰發生後、難民顚沛流離、兒童尤感困苦、經飭衛生局李局長調查情形、據報收容所中及其他平民兒童、平均死亡日約有二百人左右、爰飭衛生局速辦兒童醫院、以資挽救，即由李局長積極籌辦、並得財政局徐局長夏科長等盡力協籌經費、已在慕爾嗚路六十五號成立平民兒童醫院一所、暫置一百床位、業於本月十六日開始工作、凡景況困難之一歲至十歲病童、均可前往免費門診及住院治療、為擴充床位、並充實內容起見、仍須各界熱心士女懷兒童幸福者、捐贈衣服奶粉牛奶及藥品等件、如捐助現款、請交霞飛路呂班路口上海市銀行辦事處代收、並均發給蓋印正式收據、以昭愼重、而防冒名撞騙、</p>
<p>孔副院長夫人宋靄齡女士、前曾獨仟經費、主辦傷兵醫院於麗都原址、成續懋著、嗣奉中央令、私人醫院、皆須結束、故將全院物品、移贈內地蘇州後方醫院、孔夫人鑒於社會上猶無兒童醫院之設備、一般貧病兒童、無從就醫故早有創辦兒童醫院之計劃、現因傷兵醫院結束竣事、决提前開辦、地點以康腦脫路某大洋房最為適宜、惟該處現尚有孔夫人扶助之基督敎徒難民甚多、近日正進行設法另為安頓、大約一星期後即可成立、聞該院專收六歲至十二歲左右無父母扶養之被難兒童、全院可收容一百名之譜、開辦之初、暫收六十名、孔夫人並擬俟各兒童康健恢復後、施以相當教育、與中華慈幼恊會所辦教育機關實行聯絡、使該院兒童最低可受高小敎育、其有天資卓越者、則甄別升學、更予深造、其餘設法使其就業、以成社會有用之才、孔夫人並望將來在各地大城市均有同樣設備、其造福於兒童及國家當非淺鮮、</p>

<h3>隨軍日記（九）（附圖片）</h3>
<p>— 中央社特派隨軍記者陳萬里</p>
<p>十月十五日</p>
<p>天空比較前昨兩日平靜得多了、雖然嗡嗡的機聲、還不時來侵擾、按載在蕰藻浜的南岸進行、敵人是忘不了大傷和眞如、不過也只白白地送命、這個中央突破的夢想、總得要在我們的槍刺之下粉碎了的、</p>
<p>“陣中日報”和“陣中畫報”、都是最近出版的戰時讀物、聽說是專門供給在前綫的將士們阅讀的、內容都很豐富、我看對陣中畫報上有一幅　連綫的沒畫、畫着一個士兵紥了個草人、掛在樹枝上、下面繋了一根繩子、自己便拿了繩子的一端、伏在戰壕之中、把草人不斷地牽動着、敵人遠遠地看到了、以爲是我們進襲、於是就倉皇地胡亂轟擊、花了不少的砲彈、有人吿訴我、這是戰地的寫實、我覺得很有趣味、</p>
<p>今天的晚上和白天同樣的沉寂很少聽到砲聲、應得可以安眠一晚了。</p>
<p>十月十六日</p>
<p>早晨四點鐘起床、忽忽地到了上海、見到許多朋友、十分愉快、在晚上兩點多鐘、又忽忽地踏着月亮回來、沿途看到擔架兵從火綫上抬着傷兵下來、他們在家屬中站着等候救護車來到、我是深深地感動了、我覺得我們對於負傷的勇士們、是需要更快地予以救護的。</p>
<p>十月十七日</p>
<p>猛烈的戰爭、在葛家牌樓宅和陳家行兩地展開、敵人一方面是企圖南進（葛家牌樓宅）經大衆而建眞如、完成大包圍的形勢、一方是企圖西進、（陳家行）但衆趨南翔、實現中央突破的戰略、但是　敵人在兩地都受到了重大的打擊、而在葛家牌樓宅更有壯烈的血戰在進行、</p>
<p>侯家木橋（在廟行正面）的敵人、前人向我們新宅陣地進犯給我們打了個落花流水、並且還捉到了一個俘虜、他是第一師團步兵第二旅團第三聯隊第三大隊第十二中隊第二小隊的一等兵，名字叫做田中淸藏已經在昨天解到了這裏。</p>
<p>一個滿臉長着鬍子、頭頂已經禿了的中年人、他便是田中淸藏、他生長在東京、今年三十五歲、在東京開着一家花店、他是後備役、在大正十二年退伍的、這次侵華的戰事爆發之後、預備役和後備役都動員了、他也就在軍閥的驅使之下、到了上海、浸在水裏作戰、已經有一個多禮拜、腰部和兩腿部腫痛、精神更疲倦到了極點、因此逃不動而給我們俘虜了、</p>
<p>據他說、這向日軍在上海的傷亡很重、一般地說傷亡都已超過半數、而第二師團的傷亡更重、幾乎所俘無幾、他自己所屬的第一師團、加納旅團長和長谷田韓隊長、也都已經陣亡了、査加納旅團長於本月十一日在曹家宅戰死、名治雄、東京府人、五十歲、係士官第二十一期出身、曾任步兵第十三聯隊附、及第一師團副官、</p>
<p>我們問他松井大將之受傷是否確實、他回答的是“聽說確實受了傷、”</p>
<p>他還說現在日軍的飲食、發生了絕大的困難、士兵在前綫都携帶了乾糧、每兩天發一次、但是吃了乾糧之後、大家無法止渴、就胡亂的喝着污濁的生水、因此痢疾在土兵中嚴重地流行着。</p>
<p>對於這次戰事、他表示了極度的反感、他說後備役和預備役、對於這次戰事、都一致表示反對的、實在日本經濟的力量、還不能擔負這回的戰爭、</p>
<p>他對於我們的優待、十分感激、而更感激的是他因此將來得以生還東京了、</p>
<p>十月十八日</p>
<p>照常地轟炸、照常地砲擊、但是步兵却整天祇有小接觸而已、今天敵機又在陣地的上空散了六七種不同的傳單、大多數是“　歡迎投降”、並有“漲價”了說是“持此傳單來投降者賞洋兩元”、—這祇是暴露了敵人狼狽醜態、同時也證明了敵人對於戰事之毫無辨法而已、</p>
<p>有一種傳單上面還印着英文、不知道敵方是否是接受了外國記者的建議、希望英美的駐軍也去投降、這眞是令人莫測高深了。</p>
<p>敵人除了“歡迎”我們“投降”之外、還挑撥和離間我們對於英國的感情在他們散發的許多傳單之中、有一張呌做“英國榨取中國資金圖”說是“歐美派協助英國把中國的資金源源不絕的流入英國、我看了這張“英國榨取中國資金圖”之後、就想到敵機之掃射英國大使和航空武官决非出於誤會、他們正是看淸楚了英國的國旗、才加以射擊的</p>
<p>今天有人爲俘虜田中淸藏攝影、我也就照了幾張、當時他看到我抽着烟捲、便討了一枝、並且還要求寫一封家書、回去報吿平安、因為他自從九月十四日參戰以來、對於國內的通信、長官是絕對禁止的、大約是怕把失利的眞相傳到國內去吧、</p>

<h3>（瑣評）</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>敵日此次急急對華用兵。歐洲政局之不安甯。亦為其原因之一。故自中日不宣血戰之後。又與德意締結某種協定。遙為聲援。此種擧動。明明對於蘇聯作一種表示的姿勢日。“假定你來，須得後顧。”其實敵日對於國際間的信義。早經破產。今日聯合德意以作聲援者。安知他日形勢一變。又聯合蘇俄以作後盾。德意雖愚。亦决不肯眞實為彼利用。而造成第二次大戰也。並且中俄的關係。與日德意的關係。其形勢逈不相侔。敵日以中國為綿年。以蘇聯為仇敵。第一步侵略我華。第二步卽對俄開戰。故我國此次抗敵不啻為蘇俄敵抗也。德意之興我國。素稱敦睦。而與敵日亦並無好感。不過因某種關係。而與敵日聯為一氣。但敵日的力量。自經此次開戰而後。其伎倆亦圖窮而七首見矣。德意旣不足以利用敵日而反為敵日利用。豈不是寃。</p>
<h3>我軍全線反攻克復要點多處</h3>

<p>葛家牌樓一帶</p>
<p>蕰藻浜南岸葛家牌樓黃港一帶、為激戰之中心、我為剷除葑村塘兩岸敵軍勢力、採兩翼夾擊、及由後路大包圍之策略、故在正面湖裹宅、蘇家宅·小池園·之綫、嚴堵敵軍之續進、而由談家頭經張家樓下沿葑村塘襲其左背、我軍前仆後繼、有進無退、敵經我圍擊、勢力漸趨動搖、惟該處敵集有堅强之主力、故一時尚難予以殱滅、</p>
<p>陳家巷至廣福</p>
<p>陳家巷以至廣福全綫、我軍頗有進展、我軍由頓悟寺·老陸宅·廣福·吳宅·張家宅·朱北宅·各點出擊、聲勢甚盛、敵望風披靡、張家宅·吳宅·當前之南梅宅·爲敵右翼主力所在、我由兩旁兜擊、敵卒不支、我載獲其檢械等甚多、廣福正面、則前進千餘公尺、經新木橋而至西二房·老陸宅、我罼克復唐橋頭後、向北轉進、與西二房之部隊合攻士橋而克之、其中有戴宅一點、敵堅守不退、已爲我重重包圍、頓悟寺之東北兩面、我已克復盛家宅·橋亭宅·朱三房·等、</p>

<h3>砲火中的觀感</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>（本報特寫）在前夜的天空皓月之下，汽車繞行着比較安全的路線，好似張天師畫符籙的章法，東灣西轉地硬把我們送到××方面的最前線。可幸一路之上，并未承飛機先生的光顧，當是總理在天有靈！</p>
<p>不過中途走着幾個小村鎭，則見屋宇坍塌，瓦礫遍地，從還在蕩漾着　的飛鏖　和火藥味的流風餘韻中，還可嗅察出這是瘋狂殘暴的敵機，在白天或下晚剛撤了的爛汚。有些虎口餘生，徼倖未炸毀的商店，雖然門窗關得緊緊的，看不見一綫兒燈光，但是另從幾家照常推磨濾漿的豆腐店的銷路去推想，可斷盾民絕未因敵機之轟炸，便孬死光或逃完。敵人如此任意轟炸非戰區人民的一切不法行爲，除了㊀加强我們抗戰必求到勝利的决心，㊁越發激起國際間對日的公憤，㊂替他們大和民族子孫，自己播種下些惡因果之外，難道他們的那好像早被人類正義之箭射穿成一個大血洞的太陽旗，也會隨着炸彈驟然下挿於我們的領土上麼？</p>
<p>敵機漫無標準的投彈法，不但“豈有此理”，有時且“莫測高深”。前線上一位副官長說：“他曾親見一架敵機，遠從我後方飛來，在坦然數百畝的棉地上，投彈八枚而去。次日簿暮，復見如故”。這是因爲駕駛人飛出後尋不着目標，只好隨便投了，以便報銷呢？或是他已覺悟到彼國軍閥侵略之非法，而消極地實行他的反戰思想呢？我想若幸而是後者的原故，則此類事態的新發展，必將愈演愈甚，以促日帝國主義之崩潰。</p>
<p>正在前線某地指揮作戰的××師師長××將軍，他又同我們講了一件相類的意外事，他說：“今天有敵砲運二十餘枚，一個追一個地打在附近，可是奇怪得很，若有一個會爆炸的，那我們這一窩就要不得了！當時大家笑評此事，有說“天相中國”的，有說“鬼神呵護幅將”的，實際上則大家明白：這顯然又是敵人自己給自已搗鬼。否則就事論事也是敵人暴露軍火失效的大弱點。</p>
<p>我們對於敵人的軍實，固然不能把牠估計得太高，但也不宜估計得太低。譬如前幾天敵人打來的砲彈，上有最近昭和十二年造的年號，若竟相信中日開戰僅二月，敵人砲火卽感缺乏之說，這無疑的是要犯了估計太低的錯誤。可是敵人二月來的四次總攻，用盡了他們所有的飛機大砲毒瓦斯種種法寶，還被我英勇抗戰的健兒們，弄得一籌莫展，寸步難行。他們原是最崇拜物質的，所以才把最近改良的新式砲彈，搬演上場，然而成績亦不過如此而已。這，當然是反映我用極旺盛極振奮的士氣，以撻伐唯物質是恃的敵人，必將一帆風順，節節勝利到底。</p>
<p>現在敵人第五次第六次的援軍，又已胆戰心悸地相繼抵滬了·然而我們前線越殺越起勁，愈打愈有經騐的英勇將士，聞此消息，不過報之以冷笑曰：“我們希望他們一批批的快來上海，殺了個少一個；否則他們不來這里，終歸要去華北！”這是多麼豪壯負責的話！古人有善殺牛的，則目中無全牛。以彼例此，那麼眼前的這些跳梁倭寇，在我叱咜風雲，氣吞牛斗的將士心目中，當然也同樣的早成了運回台灣去的千箱萬匣的屍灰去了！</p>
<p>來一批打一批，殺一個少一個——這並不是我將士言過其實早夸言，那天他們在市中心區反攻勝利戰中，捉得三個貨眞價實的東洋俘虜，從他們吱吱唔唔的口供里，才曉得敵軍自開戰以來，確已傷亡過半。他們原是剛調來的預備兵，尚未譜習戰况。在東京徵調時，騙他們說，僅在租界上防衛共產軍？），誰知一到上海，就呌他們來上火線。有幾天伙食送不上，眞餓得要死……那俘虜說着，竟不顧他們所謂皇軍才尊嚴（？），而涕泗滂沱，呌苦連天了。如此沮喪的士氣，驅詣槍林彈雨，殺聲震野的疆塲上，不是等於驅羔羊以膏虎吻麼？</p>
<p>另一個俘虜又說，他們的總司令部。即設於我富麗堂皇的新市府大禮堂中。附近高大建築物，如博物館圖書館及體育館等，都有高射砲拱衛着。領導一般日本無辜平民來滬送死的人屠販子松井大將，確已受傷，躲在司令部中，勉强坐鎭指揮。</p>
<p>敵軍自八一三揭開戰幕以後，他們所用的戰略，初出翼端攻襲，屢遭痛擊，實力殆將喪盡，乃請精銳援軍，如所謂機械化部隊之久留米師團等，企圖中央突破，雖不惜屢次付以重大代價，但所得有限，卒不能輕越雷池而過。中央突破之計，旣屢告失敗，今後倘欲再改用兩翼包圍，可是陣線拉長，勢必較以前增加兩倍以上的兵力。但彼蕞爾三島，將如何再蒐維如此衆多的兵數，情不得已，似將仍採用中央突破，但我步步爲營，穩紥穩打，無論他從任何一點突進，不觸着我們嚴陣以待的彈幕，便要自投我們久候多時的火網，包管呌他們步着以前數次失敗的覆轍，抱頭鼠竄地潰退而去</p>
<p>這是我們在前線的一個陣地上：前面有敵我機槍，旅進旅退的咯咯掃射聲，後面有我高瞻遠矚，隆隆向敵正確轟擊的大砲聲，遠望黃浦江上空，遠有敵機不斷高射上去的探海燈，和紅綠相間的信號彈照明彈。不用說，這又是我們的飛機正在虹口一帶大顯神威了，……在這樣的一個前線環境里，向我英勇抗戰的將士們，實地探訪得的一些片段的資料（二六、一○、二○、）</p>

<h3>Our Army Launches a Full-Scale General Offensive, Punishing and Crushing Rebellious Enemies on All Fronts</h3>
<p>The Battle at Chenjiaxiang is Fierce, with Gunfire Ceaseless Throughout the Night - Enemy Forces at Gejia Pailou and Huanggang Suffer Extremely Heavy Casualties - Our Forces Fiercely Attack Zhabei and Jiangwan, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy - Our Air Force Assists in the Battle, Artillery Displays Its Power</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter, in order to investigate the intense battles of the past few days, especially drove to the front line last night at 6:30 PM via a side road. The entire journey was shrouded in gunfire, with light and flames radiating everywhere. Our artillery was exerting its power, bombarding the enemy, the rumbling sound shaking the four fields. When returning to the office at 1:00 AM this morning, the sound of gunfire continued incessantly. At the same time, our air force also launched a night raid, with the enemy's anti-aircraft guns and machine guns randomly firing into the air, sparks flashing. Starting at 8:00 PM last night (the 21st), our army ordered a full-scale general offensive. The situation on all fronts is extremely favorable. Our artillery concentrated on targets, simultaneously launching a fierce bombardment of the enemy's positions. The density of the gunfire was unprecedented, especially in the Chenjiaxiang area. At the same time, our troops also made the most intense advances along this route. Chenjiaxiang is a powerful stronghold of our army, which has always remained in our hands, never having fallen. The area around Dunwu Temple, Shenjiazha, and Zhusanfang has been a point of contention between the two sides, with advances and retreats occurring no less than a dozen times. Therefore, the houses in the villages in that area have all been destroyed, a scene of scorched earth, only their names remaining. Currently, our army has adopted a semi-encirclement strategy, fiercely attacking them last night. At the same time, our rear troops are continuously advancing forward, and the enemy is showing signs of being unable to withstand the pressure. In the Guangfu area, around 3:00 PM yesterday, the enemy launched a prolonged artillery barrage against us, but we suffered no losses. Their troops were deeply entrenched in the trenches and did not come out to engage. We ignored them. At night, our army launched a full-scale general offensive, with the infantry and artillery maintaining close coordination, fiercely attacking the enemy. Although the enemy also came out of their trenches to resist, they suffered extremely heavy casualties. As for the Shixianggong Temple line, our army has gained a considerable advantage. The enemy is currently adopting a defensive posture, while our army is attacking daily, making considerable progress repeatedly, and the fortifications are gradually being strengthened, becoming exceptionally solid. The enemy has absolutely no way to advance. In the Liuhe area, our army's positions are even more secure than Mount Tai. This area was originally the enemy's main target, attempting to repeat the old trick from January 28th, outflanking our rear to shake our overall situation. We saw through their plot, so we deployed heavy troops and established powerful fortifications, rendering the enemy helpless. Even if they were to attempt a landing with a division or two of troops, it would not be difficult for us to annihilate them immediately. Therefore, this kind of conspiracy by the enemy has long been hopeless. Furthermore, at 4:00 AM this morning, this newspaper received a report from the front lines that our army had launched a full-scale general offensive since 7:30 PM last night. As of the time of the report, progress had been quite rapid on all fronts. The battle situation is as follows: ㊀ Our army north of Dachang advanced north along the Hutai Highway from Ximipu, and after several assaults, advanced to Wujiazhai around 11:00 PM, with Hujia Yan as the objective. Around 1:00 AM this morning, fierce fighting was still ongoing there. ㊁ Our army advancing from the line of Zhaojiajiao and Qiangmentou Zhai, with Heida Huangzhai as the objective, advanced very rapidly. Unable to withstand the pressure of our artillery fire, the enemy collapsed and retreated one after another. Around 9:00 PM, our army approached the vicinity of Sunjiachi to Yangzhai. ㊂ The enemy in the area around Gejia Pailou Zhai, after being encircled and severely attacked by our three sides, already appeared exhausted and unable to cope. Starting at 8:00 PM, our side, under the cover of intensive artillery fire from large cannons, gradually advanced. Around 1:00 AM this morning, the battle was still raging fiercely. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in this battle, while our side also suffered considerable losses. ㊃ North of Miaohang, our army, with Zhouxing as the center, launched a fierce attack on the enemy at Yanjiawan. Progress along this route was also quite rapid. Around 12:00 AM this morning, they had already advanced to the area of Caojiazhai and Zhangzhai. The enemy's link west of Yanjiawan has already been cut off by us. ㊄ In the Chenjiaxiang area, our army launched attacks along two routes: one advancing eastward along the Yunzaobang, with Guojiazhai and Qiaojiazhai as the objective, and the other attacking northwards, with Yangzhai, Zhusanfang, and Shenjiazhai as the objective. The battle along this route was the most intense. From yesterday evening to 2:00 AM this morning, there was a bloody battle lasting for ten hours. The density of gunfire and the intensity of artillery fire were unprecedented. Our army advanced bravely and gained a considerable advantage.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency's correspondent with the army reported at 9:30 PM on the 21st that the outbreak of the Shanghai battle today marked seventy days. In the past half-month, the center of gravity of the battle has shifted to the south bank of the Yunzaobang, with repeated assaults along the Hutai Highway running north-south and on both banks of the Fengcun Tang running east-west. The intensity of the battle is truly unprecedented. As for the Luodian, Guangfu, Miaohang, Jiangwan, and Zhabei lines, there were only contacts between small units. Even our army's artillery in Pudong has been quiet for many days. Our army has adopted a long-term resistance strategy of attrition, mostly adopting a defensive posture. The enemy's four general offensives have all ended in failure after being met with our head-on counterattacks. This time, they have twice fiercely attacked the south bank of the Yunzaobang, attempting to advance into Dachang, putting forth their full effort for a final struggle. However, they were severely blocked by us at Wanjia Pailou and no longer have the strength to advance. Their exhausted and desperate state has been fully exposed. In order to severely punish the enemy, our army began a full-scale counteroffensive at 7:30 PM today. The air force also dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle. The intensity of our army's artillery fire is unprecedented since the start of the Shanghai battle. As of the time of the report, our loyal and brave soldiers on all fronts, under the cover of intensive artillery fire, were fiercely attacking the enemy with heroic posture, and the fierce battle was progressing smoothly.</p>
<h3>The Enemy at Gejia Pailou and Huanggang is Attacked in the Rear and Forced to Retreat</h3>
<p>The Fengcun Tang Area is Shrouded in Gunfire All Day Long - The Battle is Fierce, with the Enemy Suffering a Severe Blow</p>
<p>North of Dachang, the battle is still raging fiercely. Our army's front lines are exceptionally solid. The enemy, who are putting forth their full effort to attack Dachang, have suffered heavy casualties after being fiercely attacked by our army at Gejia Pailou, Huanggang, and Yujia Zhai, and dare not continue their advance. After two days and two nights of bloody battle, the enemy is showing signs of exhaustion and inability to cope. At 4:30 AM yesterday morning, the enemy again attempted to break through, fiercely attacking our army, and the bloody battle unfolded again. Our army bravely advanced, suppressing them. Under the concentrated fire of the enemy, they fell forward one after another, charging straight ahead, killing countless of the enemy who were attempting to break through. After this heavy blow, the enemy still retreated to their original positions. West of the highway, the enemy at Gejia Pailou and Huanggang are still surrounded by our army. The battle situation from yesterday all day to the night is described in detail as follows.</p>
<p>Repeated Assaults Ultimately Fail</p>
<p>The Central News Agency's correspondent with the army in Jiangwan reported at 9:30 PM on the 21st that the south bank of the Yunzaobang, along the Hutai Highway and both sides of the Fengcun Tang, was shrouded in gunfire all day long. Starting at dawn, enemy planes came in formations and dropped many bombs on our positions. The enemy in the Huanggang area has been attacking our Huli Zhai, Sujia Zhai, and Shengjia Zhai continuously from morning to night. We stood ready, and upon seeing the enemy approaching, immediately strafed them with machine guns. Although the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, we held our original positions and remained unmoved. At noon, the enemy used many tanks to cover infantry in a fierce attack on our line of Zhujia Zhai and Chenjia Zhai on the west side of the highway. Our warning line was breached once, but after a valiant charge, we finally drove the enemy away and restored our original positions. On the east side of the highway, the enemy attacked the entire line from Sujia Qiaozhai, Gaoren Qiaozhai, to Lu Zhai, Shenjiawan, and Zhoucheng Zhai from the northwest and both fought fiercely all day. However, our positions were solid and our defenses were tight, and the enemy ultimately had no opportunity to exploit.</p>
<p>Our Army's Counteroffensive is Irresistible</p>
<p>Following the lull in fighting, the enemy in the Gejia Pailou and Huanggang area, after being blocked by us, no longer had the ability to advance. The enemy is currently trying to build fortifications in Gejia Pailou in order to hold fast. Taking advantage of the enemy's unstable position, we immediately launched a counteroffensive yesterday afternoon, flanking them from the left wing, breaking through along the south bank of the Fengcun Tang, and cutting off their rear. At that time, although enemy planes were unusually active, our troops all assembled under Zhangjialou at the scheduled time. Once the order was given, our army, regardless of their own safety, charged forward in a bloody assault, pressing hard on the enemy's positions. Our army gained a considerable advantage.</p>
<h3>Our Army Launches Attacks in Jiangwan and Zhabei, Killing the Enemy</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency's correspondent in Zhabei reported at 1:25 AM on the 22nd that yesterday, our army launched counterattacks on all fronts. In the Jiangwan area, starting at 3:30 PM, small units from Hejiaxiang, Dongzhai, Baziqiao, and the Tiyuhui Road launched guerilla attacks in separate directions on the city center area and the Sijing Ballfield. Upon seeing our advance, the enemy forces immediately hid themselves, but several tanks came and went to block our advance. Our troops then proceeded by backroads, and by 6:00 PM, several teams advanced along Jipu, killing over sixty enemy soldiers along the way. We also dispatched small units to attack the enemy at Tanjiazhai, Shuidian Road, Huojia Muqiao, and Liuying Road, as well as the enemy at the Liusan Garden and the Aiguo Girls' School. At 7:30 PM, the gunfire intensified and the general offensive began. Our artillery fire was accurate, repeatedly hitting key enemy targets, but the enemy avoided engaging in combat. Therefore, there was only contact with outposts in various locations. Enemy tanks were also active on the Jiangwan Road. At 9:30 PM, our army once charged from Baziqiao near Liusan Garden to annihilate the enemy, and then retreated, confronting the enemy. At the intersection of Guangdong Street and Dongbinxing Road, we also used a small unit to charge to the North Sichuan Road to harass the enemy, who were deeply entrenched behind fortifications, retaliating with machine guns. At that time, the dense gunfire shook the entire city, lasting for about two hours, before gradually subsiding. We achieved our goal of harassment and then withdrew to our original defenses.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Comes to Shanghai to Assist in the Battle</h3>
<p>Enemy Barracks and Ammunition Depots are Bombed by Us</p>
<p>At 10:35 PM last night, our air force came to Shanghai to assist in the battle. Enemy warships in the air space over the Huangpu River first used searchlights to search the sky, and then bombarded with anti-aircraft guns. It stopped after about three minutes. At 11:45 PM, the gunfire resumed, more intense than the first time, and the sound of anti-aircraft machine guns was also continuous, but not as dense as in the past. The purpose of our aircraft was not to bomb enemy warships, so they flew away safely. At 1:10 AM this morning, enemy warships made another disturbance, but the gunfire was also sparse, presumably the enemy was unable to bear the burden of wasting ammunition.</p>
<p>The staff quarters of the Fourth Factory of the Japanese-owned Shanghai Textile Company on Pingliang Road and Meizhou Road, since the outbreak of the war, have been used by the enemy as barracks. In addition, the staff quarters on Pingliang Road and Qiqihar Road have been used as an ammunition depot. Last night, our air force, while coming to Shanghai to assist in the battle, went to the sky over Meizhou Road at 12:12 AM this morning to bomb the enemy's barracks, which immediately exploded and caught fire, burning fiercely. It was not extinguished until 1:34 AM this morning. The enemy suffered many casualties. Around 1:00 AM this morning, the enemy's ammunition depot on Qiqihar Road was also bombed by our air force, catching fire and burning, and a large number of munitions exploded and detonated, the sound shaking the four fields. It was not until around 2:40 AM that the explosive force weakened slightly, and fire-fighting could begin. As of 4:00 AM this morning, the flames had not been completely extinguished. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Dachang is Absolutely Secure</h3>
<p>In recent days, due to the fall of Gejia Pailou Zhai and Huanggang into enemy hands, the Dachang area has been under serious threat. The safety of Dachang is even more related to the battle situation in Jiangwan and Zhabei. Therefore, readers of newspapers have been very concerned about the situation in Dachang. This newspaper's reporter went to the front line last night and asked a senior commander, who said that the gains and losses of a small village are actually not very important. Although the enemy in the Heida Huangzhai area has penetrated deep near Huanggang, the situation in Dachang is not as serious as imagined. In short, Dachang is absolutely secure. Currently, the enemy at Gejia Pailou is surrounded by us on three sides, the front and the left and right sides, and the position is shrinking narrower and narrower, already becoming an extremely narrow triangular shape. The front is attacked by our Houjiaku, Shengjiazhai, and Jiejingzhai. The left is pressed by our Qiangmentou Zhai to Yangwan Zhai. The right is flanked by our Maqiaozhai and Jixiangzhai along the highway. Although the enemy is eagerly building fortifications, being trapped in a dead end is no different from inviting their own destruction. After our fierce counterattack last night, it will not be difficult to annihilate them. The commander also said that we have extremely solid trenches and strong troops in that area. Even if the enemy attacks Dachang, they will definitely not succeed. Zeng Guofan said, "Build solid camps and fight to the death." Our army is now adopting this strategy, and the future of the war is absolutely optimistic.</p>
<h3>Map of the Yunzaobang South Bank War Zone</h3>
<h3>Enemy Assault on Chenjiaxiang Repelled</h3>
<p>A portion of the enemy force launched another assault on our Chenjiaxiang line. The enemy came with a fierce momentum, launching multiple assaults, but were all bravely repelled by our loyal soldiers. Our army's lines remain unmoving.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency in Suzhou telegraphed on the 21st that on the 20th, the enemy launched fierce attacks on our Maqiaozhai, Chenjiaxiang, and near Xinlao Lu Zhai, all of which failed. At 9:00 PM on the 20th, the enemy launched a fierce attack on our Xinlao Lu Zhai. Our army rose up to meet the attack, and around 12:00 AM, the enemy, unable to withstand the pressure, retreated. Since the morning of the 21st, the enemy has again attacked the aforementioned locations, and our army is currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Plan to Land at Mingsha Port</h3>
<p>Several enemy warships and many small motorboats are gathered at Mingsha Port in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River outside the mouth of Wusong, seemingly with the intention of landing, but have not yet taken action. Our army is on high alert.</p>
<h3>Seven Enemy Planes at Yangshupu Confirmed to Have Been Destroyed by Our Bombing</h3>
<p>Our Air Force Ingeniously Follows Enemy Planes and Achieves a Wonderful Victory - Foreign Investigation Confirms, Japanese Authorities Do Not Deny</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that on the night of October 14th, a Chinese aircraft pilot cleverly devised a plan to destroy seven Japanese planes at the Yangshupu Japanese airfield. Although the Japanese authorities have kept this matter a secret, it has been confirmed by reliable foreign observers. On the evening of that day, amidst the continuous artillery fire in this city, four Japanese planes, with their lights on, flew back to their base, where they were seen by a Chinese plane, which also turned on its lights and joined the Japanese squadron. The Japanese planes, believing that the plane belonged to their own side, did not pay attention to it. Upon reaching the airfield, the plane also feigned a landing, and when all four Japanese planes had landed, it dropped two bombs and flew away. After the Japanese planes noticed, they immediately issued an alarm, and the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River simultaneously fired anti-aircraft guns. Residents of Shanghai should remember the deafening sound of anti-aircraft guns around 7:00 PM that day. However, the Chinese plane had already left Shanghai at that time. The rumor that the Yangshupu Japanese airfield had been moved to Wusong due to the threat from the Chinese artillery team in Pudong has been confirmed by foreign observers. Yesterday morning, a news reporter inquired about this matter to the Japanese naval spokesperson, who replied that the truth or falsehood can be found out for yourself.</p>
<h3>Enemy Officer Casualties Confirmed</h3>
<p>Japanese Planes Crash Repeatedly</p>
<p>During the Liuhang battle on the 6th, 7th, and 8th, the enemy suffered very heavy casualties. The names of six officers of the rank of major or above who were killed in action or seriously wounded were announced by their military headquarters. Tokujiro Iizuka was killed in action at Sujiazhai, Jojiro Uno was seriously wounded by a bullet at Yangjiazhai, and Masao Sato was shot through the right chest at Liuhang and seriously wounded. In addition, Sueki Nakayama was killed in action, and Teiichiro Inaba and Michikazu Ishida were all seriously wounded, but the locations were not detailed. Furthermore, the enemy, realizing the weakness of their air force's combat power and the heavy casualties of their combatants, is actively engaged in training, causing planes to crash almost every day. According to the Tokyo Asahi, on the afternoon of the 6th, a fighter plane crashed at the Kagamigahara airfield. The plane was completely destroyed, and the pilot, Sergeant Tsutomu Imai, died on the spot. Also, according to the Osaka Mainichi, on the morning of the 9th, two planes collided in the air at the Kasumigaura Naval Airfield. One plane was piloted by instructor Major Motohachi Miyazaki, and crashed to the ground, seriously injured and died shortly thereafter.</p>
<h3>One Enemy Plane Shot Down in Huacao Town</h3>
<p>Two Enemy Pilots Burned to Death</p>
<p>The Central News Agency's correspondent with the army in Jiangwan reported at 12:25 PM on the 21st that at 10:00 AM this morning, an enemy plane dropped bombs in Huacao Town and was hit by our army's anti-aircraft guns. It immediately caught fire and crashed into a small bay near the Suzhou River. The two pilots were dragged out by our garrison and were completely charred beyond recognition. Only the words "Third Team" were on its parts.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troop Movements</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops are Cowardly</p>
<p>The enemy troops in the area of Laodan Zhai, Qin Zhai, and Zhangjia Village northwest of Luodian have recently been rotated. The newly arrived troops have very poor discipline. Whenever they are hit by our planes and artillery, they shout loudly and become extremely chaotic. They are also exceptionally cowardly, firing their guns randomly day and night to embolden themselves. However, their machine gunners seem to be quite calm.</p>
<p>Corpses and Wounded Soldiers</p>
<p>Around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, another enemy merchant ship converted into a Red Cross ship, the America Maru, sailed to Shanghai and docked at the Huishan Wharf, carrying away approximately one thousand enemy corpses and wounded soldiers. In recent days, a total of five enemy Red Cross ships have sailed to Shanghai, indicating the heavy casualties suffered by the enemy.</p>
<p>Tanks Arrived</p>
<p>Yesterday, four more enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, the Nishiyama Maru, Ryukou Maru, Kotoku Maru, and another transport ship of unknown name, sailed to Shanghai and docked at the Huangpu and Hongkou wharves, bringing over one hundred tanks, over three hundred military vehicles, and other military supplies and ammunition. Unloading began at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Twenty-Seven Enemy Warships</p>
<p>At dawn yesterday, an enemy cruiser, the Takinogeme, sailed to Shanghai and anchored off the Hongkou Wharf.

<h3>Our Army's Great Victory in Counter-offensive in Northern Shanxi</h3>
<p>The enemy's main force north of Yuanping was encircled and routed by our forces. The enemy's second attempt to cross the Zhang River on the Pinghan Front was unsuccessful. Our army's advance north along the Jinpu Railway means the imminent recovery of all lost territories.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Shanxi Frontline Report: Associated Press war correspondent Belden reported from the frontline today that the Chinese army had changed its strategy and launched a major counter-offensive. After using guerrilla tactics to besiege the enemy on all sides, it has achieved unprecedented victory on the entire northern Shanxi front. In recent days, fierce battles have taken place along the borders of Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. The Chinese army is advancing on all fronts. The main fronts are Yuanping, 80 miles north of Taiyuan, and Niangziguan, 130 miles east, both of which are key points for controlling Taiyuan. The Japanese army has advanced along multiple routes and, to protect transportation, has had to deploy troops along the way, gradually being wiped out by the Chinese army. At Nanhuaikuaizi, northwest of Yuanping, the Chinese army launched a surprise attack from Ningwu, completely annihilating an entire enemy brigade and capturing three to four hundred prisoners. North of Yuanping, the main force of two enemy divisions was also encircled and routed by the Chinese army's skilled troops, leaving countless corpses. Among them were many White Russians, though the reporter did not witness this personally. At the same time, the Chinese army's guerrilla forces have cut off enemy transportation in the mountains north of Yanmen Pass, forcing over a hundred Japanese freight vehicles to retreat to Datong, plunging the enemy's main force on the front lines into dire straits. With the traffic between Datong and Yuanping cut off, and the route from Zhangjiakou to eastern Shanxi impassable due to the Chinese army's recapture of Pingxingguan, enemy cavalry attempting to flee to Hebei were blocked by Chinese militia and forces. Meanwhile, Chinese guerrilla teams sped down the mountain paths along the Shanxi border, endangering the traffic on the Pinghan Railway. Currently, Chinese army aircraft in Taiyuan bomb Japanese positions daily, with intense aerial warfare. The Chinese army's frontline has also received many new artillery pieces, and coordination between infantry, artillery, and air force is extremely close. As a result, the Japanese army has collapsed in three routes east of Yuanping. During the retreat of enemy troops from Guoxian, 22 tanks were destroyed, and Japanese and Mongolian troops suffered 3,000 casualties. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The number of volunteer soldiers near Beiping is increasing daily. Small teams of Japanese soldiers are ambushed from time to time. Foreign residents here often see dozens of wounded Japanese soldiers returning in groups from the suburbs. The Japanese authorities have now dispatched most of the over 5,000 Japanese troops in Beiping to guard key locations outside the city. When discussing the situation in Shanxi, a Japanese spokesman admitted that the Japanese army is suffering greatly from mountain warfare. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] On the morning of the 20th, the enemy north of Xinkou attacked our right flank at Lingshan (about 30 miles east of Xinkou). After a fierce counterattack by our army, they retreated. The enemy in the central area attacked our Guanzhuang (between Xinkou and Yuanping). Our army fought bravely to seize the mountain peaks from the enemy. Although both regimental commanders were wounded, they continued to lead their troops in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. In desperation, the enemy released tear gas, but its effectiveness was minimal. Our army continued to fight bravely and repelled the enemy. On the left flank, artillery fire was very intense in the morning, and the fighting was more moderate in the afternoon. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to a telegram from Taiyuan on the 19th, received by related departments in the capital: (1) Since the morning of the 19th, the enemy in northern Shanxi has launched a fierce attack on our right flank. The fighting was most intense at 10:00 AM. A certain unit of our army fought to the death to repel the attack. The fighting gradually subsided at 2:00 PM. Our central units fought with the enemy for the high ground south of Guancun. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties, and we also suffered considerable casualties. The situation is now stalemated. Most of the enemy remains near Yongxing Village and are using smoke screens, appearing to be shifting their forces to other areas. In recent days of fierce fighting, we have destroyed more than 20 enemy tanks and more than 100 armored vehicles, all of which were abandoned in riverbeds. Since then, enemy tanks and armored vehicles have not dared to approach our army's positions. (2) The enemy at Jiuguan in eastern Shanxi is still facing off against our army. Enemy and our forces are fiercely engaged in battle at Faluling, and are currently in a stalemate. (3) A battalion of a certain brigade of a certain route army of our forces rushed to Yanmen Pass on the 18th to destroy transportation. The enemy urgently dispatched two regiments of reinforcements from Guoxian and Fanshi, resulting in fierce fighting. (4) The Tianjin Japanese army headquarters ordered the Hasegawa unit to attempt to move towards Xinxian. The Kayashima regiment departed from Tianjin for Shanxi. The enemy force also includes the 77th and 78th regiments of the 8th Brigade and a division of the puppet Manchukuo army. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

(21st Central News Agency Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Jinan] From last night to this morning, the frontline has been quiet. Our forces and the enemy are currently facing off across the Tuhai River. Our reinforcements continue to move north, and the enemy is also reinforcing with more than 2,000 troops. At dawn, there was artillery fire on the front lines. Five of our aircraft flew to Pingyuan and Yucheng to bomb. Enemy aircraft dropped four bombs about 20 miles west of this city at dawn, mistakenly bombing sorghum stalk dams, with no other damage. Four other aircraft flew to Xuzhou and dropped two bombs, one bomb at Hanzhuang Lane Bridge, and strafed the railway station, but were damaged by our anti-aircraft fire, and one escaped. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>[Beiping] According to a statement by the Japanese military authorities, the Japanese army has reached the south bank of the Zhang River, 14 miles from Zhangde. However, the situation in Shandong Province has become mysterious. A Japanese spokesman admitted that they had encountered strong resistance, but did not admit reports of the Japanese army's retreat. It is heard that most of the Japanese army is concentrated in Wucheng, 25 miles west of Pingyuan. The Jinpu Railway line seems to have no protection at all, and Han Fuqu's troops have advanced north, encountering little resistance along the way, and are now preparing to recover Dezhou and Sangyuan. Foreign reports also state that the Shandong army has moved north from the Tuhai River and is approaching Dezhou, with the Japanese army offering no resistance. (Central News Agency 9th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Jinan] The frontline was quiet last night. At 4:00 AM on the 21st, there was an artillery battle across the Tuhai River, which quickly stopped. Currently, most of our army is advancing forward, and it will not be difficult to annihilate the remaining enemy. At 4:50 AM on the 21st, a squadron of our air force flew north over Yucheng to bomb enemy troops along the Jinpu Railway line. Two enemy aircraft dropped two bombs in Tongshan, one bomb in Hanzhuang, and strafed, but one was hit by our anti-aircraft fire and escaped wounded. Also, one enemy aircraft dropped four bombs about 20 miles west of Jinan city at around 5:00 AM on the 21st, all of which landed in the water. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>No Doubt the Attack on Chinese Fishing Boats Was by a Japanese Submarine</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Investigation Committee Holds Third Meeting, British Naval Major Testifies</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Hong Kong committee investigating the fishermen's deaths held its third meeting on the 21st. British Naval Major Herbert testified, stating that, based on the evidence, the bombing of the fishing boats was definitely by a Japanese submarine. A fourth meeting is scheduled for the 22nd. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The official committee investigating the Japanese submarine attack on Chinese fishing boats continued its meeting this morning, discussing the nationality of the submarine. According to three Chinese witnesses, they unanimously declared that the submarine had two cannons, the Arabic numeral "7" on the conning tower, and black and white stripes painted on it. The sailors on board all wore double-shouldered leather straps. Major Herbert, the committee's naval expert, testified that these are all characteristics of Japanese submarines. There is no doubt that the submarine belongs to Japan. (21st National Maritime Telegram)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Today, when the investigation into the Japanese submarine sinking of Chinese fishing boats continued, British naval expert Captain Herbert provided an eyewitness report, saying, "I testify under oath that the submarine that sank the Chinese fishing boats was definitely Japanese." According to Herbert, there have been no fewer than seven submarines recently attacking Chinese fishing boats in southern China. Their hulls are all painted with black and white stripes and other symbols specific to Japanese warships, and the sailors on board all wear the shoulder capes unique to the Japanese navy. Therefore, there is no doubt as to their Japanese nationality. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Liang Qingwei, a fisherman from Hong Kong, sailed his fishing boat out to sea on the 16th. He encountered an enemy warship in Dapeng Bay, which sent nine soldiers to his boat.

<p>[Nanjing] Eight enemy aircraft flew to the Danyang and Changzhou areas at 9:00 AM on the 21st to drop bombs, and also appeared to be heading towards the capital. Our air force rushed to intercept them, and the enemy aircraft scattered and fled.

At 1:00 PM, five enemy fighter planes flew to the capital's airspace to conduct reconnaissance for about five minutes, also intending to challenge the Chinese air force. Following them were eleven bombers, which dropped countless bombs on the airfield, creating 46 craters in the ground. The city felt the vibrations of the explosions, and black smoke and flames were seen rising in the southeast sky. At the same time, three more bombers bombed Pukou. One of the aircraft dropped something resembling a ball of black smoke, leading to suspicions that the aircraft had been shot down, but no aircraft was shot down, and what was dropped was not determined. One aircraft dropped many leaflets, but they were blown to the southeast outside the city. The alert was lifted at 3:00 PM.

<h3>Enemy Bombing of Our Cultural Institutions Falsely Accuses Us of Converting Schools into Barracks</h3>
<p>Confusing International Public Opinion in Attempt to Evade Responsibility; Such Base Tactics Only Make the World Scornful</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, enemy aircraft have violated international conventions and bombed our cultural institutions and non-combatant personnel. These illegal acts have long been scorned by all civilized countries in the world. However, due to the recent severe condemnation by international public opinion, the Japanese side is attempting to shirk responsibility and resorting to forceful sophistry. It is heard that the Allied News Agency claimed yesterday that the reason enemy aircraft bombed our cultural institutions was because we had converted schools into barracks. It is truly unknown what basis they have for saying so. For example, when National Central University and Sun Yat-sen University were bombed, they were both preparing for the start of classes. Where is the fact of their use as barracks? Moreover, those two locations are far from the front lines, so there is no need to convert them into barracks. The situation in other bombed cultural institutions is similar. In short, this kind of absurd propaganda by the Japanese side, based on strong arguments and unreasonable demands, is nothing more than an attempt to confuse international hearing and vision, and attempt to evade international criticism of Japan. But facts speak louder than words. Such base tactics by the Japanese only make the world scornful. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>China's Economic Strength Sufficient to Resist War for More Than Two Years</h3>
<p>Even if Shanghai and North China are Lost, the Struggle Will Continue  Wartime Economy is Already Prepared and Will Be Implemented Soon  Song Ziwen's Interview with Foreign Reporters</p>
<p>The English "Ta Mei Evening News" reported that Song Ziwen, President of the Bank of China, recently met with a reporter from the London "Daily Herald" and discussed the Sino-Japanese war for a long time. Song stated that even if Shanghai and the provinces north of the Yellow River were completely lost, the National Government would never cease hostilities with Japan. China's economic power is sufficient to resist the war for two years, and can be extended if necessary. If Shanghai falls, it will be regarded as only the starting point of this great war for survival. Even if Nanjing is not defended, the struggle will continue as before. If there were a possibility of truce now, we would not have resisted at Lugou Bridge, and would have already negotiated peace there. Why wait until several provinces in North China are lost? Song admitted that if Nanjing were cut off from the industrial base of Shanghai, which accounts for half of China's customs revenue, the government would suffer a major blow and would have to organize a new economic base inland, very different from the Shanghai model. However, he believes that the Chinese people are prepared to endure the great shock of adjustment. China's ability to cope with the difficulties of war has been tested and is unlimited. The people are happy to provide everything the government needs, because the whole country is now united and determined to engage in the war for survival. Song then mentioned that the Eighth Route Army has repeatedly won victories in northern Shanxi against well-equipped enemy forces. He went on to say that the long-term resistance maintained by the communists in southern China in the past is a clear demonstration of the Chinese people's ability to overcome the strong with the weak and the few with the many. The communists, with only half of Jiangxi Province as their base, were able to fight against 500,000 government troops. This shows the capacity for national mobilization and concerted effort. The reporter asked whether the central government was prepared to take the necessary severe steps to organize a thorough wartime economy, given the broad scope of the war, which requires major reforms and sacrifices. Song replied that he was already prepared, or would implement it soon. The reporter also asked why China had been slow to take resolute steps to resist the war to the end, leading many to believe that the central government was still opening the door for negotiations with Japan. Why has China not yet formally severed economic relations with Japan, nor severed diplomatic relations, nor confiscated Japanese property, nor made long-term plans to use the wealth of Chinese industries and banks to move the main area of their activities to the new inland base? Song replied that he believed these were all matters of time and only required strategy, without the need to prepare resolutions. (For example, Japanese imports to Shanghai in September have decreased by 996.6% compared to July.) As for the fourth point, it is now being realized day by day, especially for industries fundamental to the war, such as the metal industry in Shanghai, which has now mostly moved inland. At this point, Song also touched on the general public's doubts about China's ability to fight to the end, saying that China's political unity depends on continuing the resistance. If the government thinks it should succumb simply because of the fall of North China or Shanghai, then political unity will be impossible. Today, the morale of the Chinese army is very high. If we were to think about a truce now, the morale of the army would inevitably be shaken. The Battle of Songhu has sacrificed many lives, and troops from various provinces have participated. Today, talking about reconciliation would certainly not be welcomed by the frontline soldiers. Song did not want to disclose China's current war expenses, but said that they were insignificant compared to Japan's. He estimated that Japan now spends at least £750,000 a day, or about 10 million Japanese yen. Song did not underestimate Japan's ability to cope with difficulties, because in times of national crisis, it will be able to awaken its people to make painful sacrifices. Some say that Japan's economic collapse is not far off. Song did not agree with this view, but said that if Japan were to have such a day, it would inevitably be discovered before China. Song also said that the National Government is well aware that in the initial stages of the war, China's losses and failures will far exceed those of Japan, but "no darkness, no dawn." The longer China resists, the stronger its position will be, and the weaker Japan's position will be. The National Government is deeply convinced of this. The reporter then asked whether it was reliable that 800 Soviet aircraft had been transported to Lanzhou. Song replied that he had heard this and found it very interesting, but could not verify it. The reporter also asked about the Japanese army occupying Baotou and penetrating into the Ordos region, which would cut off Sino-Soviet transportation and have significant implications. Song said that this question could be answered by consulting a detailed map. The reporter also said that it was rumored that Outer Mongolia would return to China, and that the war in the north might have new developments as a result. Song had no answer to this question, but said that if the military victories Japan has achieved in Inner Mongolia were to continue to deepen, various unfavorable factors would also develop accordingly. As the Sino-Japanese war prolongs, Japan's domestic and international position will weaken. Once there is a direct conflict with the Soviet Union, it would be unthinkable. However, he believes that if the Soviet Union's decision on the Far East crisis is delayed for too long, the assistance will be very great.</p>
<h3>Going to and Fro in the Bombing</h3>

<p>The people on the street were all smiling. In those smiles, there was naturally a sense of relief from the terror, and even more so, there was the joy of "really good, really good." This joy united the emotions of our nation. We must gather this national joy into a roar of laughter to bombard down all the enemy's planes! Bombing with laughter that regards death as returning home is our most elite weapon. Enemy, come as much as you want!</p>

<p>Mr. Wang said, "Everyone knows you're here, and they're all very happy. We were just in a meeting, and everyone was looking forward to meeting you after the meeting was over, but unfortunately the air raid alarm lasted too long, so they all dispersed."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang also mentioned my plan to return to Shanghai, so I knew that Yue Jun had reported my intention to leave.</p>
<p>After talking for nearly an hour, Mr. Wang asked me, "Have you seen Mr. Gongbo yet?" I said, "I haven't seen him yet, and I'm just planning to meet him."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said, "Well, then stay here and have lunch with me. I'll call Gongbo to come, and we can talk together."</p>
<p>I said, "I've already made an appointment with Mr. Sun Zhesheng to see him before noon. I also have a lunch appointment."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said, "Well, then I'll call Gongbo and ask him to arrange a time and place."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang went in to make a phone call. At first, he came back and said that Gongbo wanted to see me and asked where I lived. I told him. But when Mr. Wang came back again, he said that Gongbo had asked me to go to his place at three o'clock.</p>
<p>It was not far from twelve o'clock, so I said goodbye and went to visit Mr. Sun Zhesheng.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhesheng also asked about my research on oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions. I had heard Dr. Wu Jingxiong say in Shanghai that Mr. Zhesheng had bought my "Yinqi Cuibian" to give to him, but he had given my "Qu Yuan" and "Faust" in return. The study of ancient artifacts seems to be becoming a general interest in China, but I have only been back in China for two months, and those studies seem like two centuries ago. I myself may be afraid of a crisis.</p>
<p>Among the furnishings, I saw a bronze vessel with a lid, a "Yi". When I opened the lid, there were inscriptions on both the lid and the bottom of the vessel. The maker was "Gongfu Zhai, the grandson of Fu Gong" (Gongfu is the courtesy name, Zhai is the given name). I remember that this vessel was recorded in "Ningshou Jiangu" or "Xiqing Gujian". Wang Guowei believed that vessels like the Yi but with lids were drinking vessels called "Sigong". However, this Gongfu Zhai Yi is large and has a lid, and the inscription clearly states that it is a Yi, and both the vessel and the inscription are not likely to be forgeries, which shows that Wang Guowei's theory of Sigong is also a bit unreliable. In ancient times, Yi and Pan (basins) were necessarily similar. Yi are vessels for holding water. Whether holding hot or cold water, it does not prevent them from having lids. It is untenable to say that Yi did not often have lids. Perhaps small Yi with lids could also hold wine, and the ancients called them Sigong.</p>
<p>Because of frequent reports, I stayed at Mr. Zhesheng's place from twelve o'clock to past three o'clock. I talked a lot, met many people, and Gongbo also came to see me here.</p>

<h3>US Representative Departs for Belgium to Cooperate with Various Countries in Creating Peace</h3>
<p>Determined to Resolve the Sino-Japanese War  US Ambassador to the UK Returns to Post Yesterday Simultaneously  Secretary of State Hull Visits Canada</p>
<p>[New York] Davis, the chief representative of the United States to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, departed from here today for Brussels. Before his departure, he expressed the hope that Japan could attend the conference and cooperate with other countries to shorten the war and peacefully resolve the Sino-Japanese problem. When a Japanese reporter asked Davis whether he was accusing Japan of being an aggressor, Davis replied, "We have no prejudice, only like other peace-loving wise people, sit down and discuss." As for whether Soviet Russia was invited to participate, Davis said, "We (probably referring to the United States) did not invite Soviet Russia," meaning that the United States does not have the authority to invite any country. Davis further stated that although the United States has a plan in mind for participating in the conference, it is unwilling to make any predictions and will probably adapt to the situation as it changes. (Guomin News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>[New York] Davis, the US representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, stated to reporters before his departure today that "What we need is peace, so we must do our best to promote peace. The US delegation's trip to Europe does not offer any promises, but we are determined to explore all avenues to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict and end the war." When asked about his hopes for the future of the conference, Davis replied, "It is not yet possible to predict what steps will be taken or what paths will be followed. Our minds are absolutely open and are not bound by anything." Davis added that, according to the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty, we can convene a conference to consult without proposing any specific actions. In addition to Davis, the members of the US delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference include Hornbeck, Special Advisor for Far Eastern Affairs at the State Department, and Murphy, Director of the European Division of the State Department. Both feel that the future of the conference will be very long and difficult. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>[New York] Davis, the chief representative of the United States to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, met with President Roosevelt at Hyde Park City yesterday for three hours, and met with the Belgian Ambassador to the United States, Pundots, today. In the afternoon at 5 p.m., he led the delegation on the "Washington" liner to Europe. Before the departure, many reporters, especially reporters from China and Japan, asked whether the severity of the international situation was equivalent to that of 1914. Davis declined to comment, saying only, "I am not a prophet. We are going to Brussels this time at the invitation of the Belgian government to seek a constructive and peaceful solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute in accordance with Article VII of the Nine-Power Treaty. We have not taken any obligations, nor do we harbor any prejudices. In short, the US government is prepared to seek any path that can lead to peace." A spokesman for the US delegation said that the Brussels conference will be based solely on the Nine-Power Treaty and will not involve the League of Nations, but if the conference ultimately fails, the League of Nations will continue to take action. As for the current position taken by the United States, it is to leave Japan some room for maneuver. (Central News Agency, Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>[New York] The US Ambassador to the UK, Bingham, recently returned home to report on his duties.

<p>⊙Ottawa US Secretary of State Hull recently came here for a private visit and told the press that the relations between the United States and Canada are harmonious and there is nothing to formally discuss.

<h3>Japan Only Received Notification of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Hirota Plans to Consider Carefully with Konoe and Related Cabinet Members  And Plans to Ask Belgium to Explain the Meaning Before Submitting a Reply</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Belgian Ambassador to Japan, Bassompierre, visited Foreign Minister Hirota this morning at 10:30 am, and formally submitted an invitation to Japan to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in accordance with instructions from his government. Foreign Minister Hirota will consult with Prime Minister Konoe and various government agencies. The Belgian invitation stated that the Belgian government, following the British government and with the consent of the US government, specially proposed to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to hold a meeting in Brussels on the 30th of this month, to review the situation in East Asia and study effective methods to promote the termination of disputes in various regions, in accordance with Article VII of the treaty. Foreign Minister Hirota believes that the content and wording of the invitation are prone to misunderstanding, so he plans to first ask the conference initiator to clarify the meaning and examine it in detail, so as to ensure that it does not leave any misunderstanding in the future, and then respond. It is now scheduled that at the cabinet meeting on the 22nd, the Foreign Minister will first report on the acceptance of the invitation, and then the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister Konoe, as well as various related cabinet members, will engage in careful consultation, taking a cautious and cautious attitude to deal with it. Among the related ministries, although it is planned to submit it to the cabinet meeting after deciding on the countermeasures, and then submit it to the Emperor for approval, it will be reported to the Belgian government. The government also plans to clarify Japan's actions towards China in its reply, announce it to China and foreign countries, and attach a statement on the Japanese government's policy on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The so-called Japanese government's established policy is that the Sino-Japanese dispute should be resolved fairly and appropriately by the two countries themselves based on reality. Therefore, in addition to regretting the invitation to participate in the Nine-Power Conference, it is difficult to accept. (Daimeng News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Federation held a meeting and passed a resolution opposing Japan's participation in the Nine-Power Conference. A copy of the proposal was sent to Foreign Minister Hirota this morning. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 21st)</p>

<h3>US Military Supplies Can Be Self-Sufficient</h3>
<p>[Washington] According to US veteran Wagner today, among the world's great powers, the only country that can be self-sufficient in wartime without waiting for external assistance is the United States. After examining 24 kinds of minerals, he determined that Japan, Germany, and Italy are all unlikely to engage in long-term warfare. In terms of these 24 kinds of mineral raw materials, the United States' self-sufficiency rate is 22.35%, Germany's is only 6.20%, Italy's is only 1.77%, and Japan's is only 1.77%. As for France, it accounts for 5.37%, Soviet Russia accounts for 4.95%, and the United Kingdom accounts for 4.50%. Weber also said that all aggressive countries are now actively storing magnesium, which is necessary for steelmaking, so he asked the United States to prepare for a rainy day and store 1,500,000 tons in case of emergency, because only Soviet Russia can be self-sufficient in this metal. As for chromium, which strengthens iron armor shells, only Soviet Russia is rich in it, so it is necessary to store it in advance. Weber went on to say that countries around the world now depend on each other for important raw materials, and few can be completely independent. Therefore, except for the United States, no country has the possibility of defeating other countries. Therefore, in his opinion, if aggressive countries are placed in a completely isolated position, and the world does not communicate with them, they will be in a situation of being unable to advance or retreat. But the United States is not the same. In the event of an emergency, in addition to its own rich mineral resources, it can also use the mineral resources of Central and South America. As for the abundance of food, there is no other country in the world that can compare with the United States. The only things lacking are the aforementioned magnesium, as well as nickel, tungsten, antimony, rubber, and quinine, which are necessary for wartime. (Guomin News Agency, 20th)</p>

<h3>Nationals, Arise! Lord Mayor of London Appeals to the British People to Donate to Aid Wounded Soldiers and Refugees in Our Country</h3>
<p>Sir Evelyn Baring Donates £1,000 Personally and Has Already Delivered It　American Red Cross Donates a Total of $108,000　League of Nations Decides to Send Medical Experts to China for Epidemic Prevention</p>
<p>[London] The Lord Mayor of London, at the joint appeal of the China Association, the British Red Cross, and the British Missionary Societies, delivered a special broadcast today, calling on the nation to donate to aid refugees in the Chinese war zones. The Lord Mayor stated that he believes that all sectors of the British people should unite to help China in its national crisis. Since the outbreak of the war in China, countless numbers of people have been left homeless, reduced to abject poverty, and are wounded or sick, urgently in need of medical assistance. This is indeed a huge problem, and the opportunistic outbreaks of cholera and typhoid are particularly worrying. British nationals are also suffering, with many having their homes destroyed and livelihoods cut off. The Lord Mayor added that the mayors of Edinburgh, Glasgow, York, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff, and Plymouth have united with him in appealing to the nation. In addition, the British Red Cross, the China Association, and the British Missionary Societies have formed a committee to receive donations, chaired by Lord Donoughmore, former Under-Secretary of State for War. All money and goods donated in Britain will be sent to China and distributed under the direction of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, and the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Northcote. The Lord Mayor of London's public letter will be published in various newspapers today. Sir Evelyn Baring, a well-known British financier, has donated £1,000, which has already been delivered to the committee. There are many other large donors. It is also noted that the joint appeal letter of December 2nd was signed by many prominent figures, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of Westminster, the Archbishop of York, and the Lord Mayor of London.

<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Assembly previously passed a resolution stipulating the appropriation of two million Swiss francs to assist the Chinese government in preventing epidemics. Regarding this matter, the League of Nations Supervisory Committee recently held a meeting to study the use and allocation of this funding from both budgetary and administrative perspectives. A plan was approved, stipulating the dispatch of medical experts, accompanied by all necessary medical supplies and sanitary equipment, to China. The salaries of these medical experts will be paid by the League of Nations, but they will be available for deployment by the Chinese government at any time as advisors to the Chinese government. The implementation of this plan will still be the responsibility of the Chinese government. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Spanish Issue Opens Up</h3>
<p>Italy and Germany Signal Concessions</p>
<p>[London] The deadlock in the Non-Intervention Committee has been broken today due to Germany and Italy rescinding their recognition of belligerent status for both sides in the Spanish Civil War. After a lengthy meeting this afternoon, Germany and Italy agreed that volunteer withdrawals should begin with a symbolic withdrawal, and agreed to send monitors to Spain to investigate the number of volunteers withdrawn. Their report will likely be studied by a subcommittee, which will determine that after a substantial withdrawal of volunteers, belligerent rights will be recognized for both sides in the Spanish Civil War. The symbolic withdrawal of volunteers will take place before the monitors enter Spain. According to an announcement issued by the Non-Intervention Committee today, the meeting made substantial progress on various important issues. The subcommittee is scheduled to reconvene at 3:00 PM on Friday. (Reuter's dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 20th)</p>

<h3>Methods for Registering Japanese Goods for the Economic Severance Association</h3>
<p>Distributed to Various Trade Associations for Registration　Final Deadline is November 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Economic Severance Association Against Japan has decided on methods for registering Japanese goods purchased before August 13th in this city. These methods have been handed over to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to be implemented by various trade associations. It is learned that various registration forms (three in total) have now been printed. It is hoped that all businesses will go to their respective trade associations immediately to register as soon as possible, no later than November 1st. The established methods for registering Japanese goods are recorded below: ㊀ All factories and businesses in this city that purchased raw materials produced in Japan, goods imported from Japan, or goods manufactured in Japanese factories in China before August 13th of this year must register with the Registration Section of this Association in accordance with these methods before October 31st. ㊁ Registration forms are divided into the following three types: (A) Raw Material Registration Form, for factories that purchase Japanese raw materials to manufacture goods; (B) Goods Registration Form, for businesses that sell Japanese goods; (C) Order Contract Registration Form, for factories and businesses that have entered into contracts with Japanese merchants or agents selling Japanese goods that have not yet been fully fulfilled. ㊂ The format of the registration form shall be determined by this Association. ㊃ The Raw Material Registration Form shall be filled out by the factory applying for registration, indicating the manufacturing process. ㊄ The Goods Registration Form shall be filled out by the business applying for registration, indicating the sales method. ㊅ In the Order Contract Registration Form, if part of the contract has been fulfilled, both the fulfilled and unfulfilled parts should be indicated. ㊆ The registration forms shall be printed and distributed by this Association, and a letter shall be sent to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to distribute them to the affiliated trade associations for distribution to member factories and businesses to fill out. ㊇ Factories and businesses that have not established trade associations and have not joined the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce as members should apply to this Association to obtain and register the forms. ㊈ The registration form should be signed and sealed in person by the factory owner or shop owner, or their manager, and should state that if any of the items filled in on the registration form are found to be untrue or incomplete, they are willing to accept the most severe punishment from this Association. ㊉ The registration form shall be in quadruplicate. After being filled out by the factory or business applying for registration, it shall be submitted directly to the respective trade association for review. The trade association shall retain one copy for record, and the remaining three copies shall be stamped and certified by the chairman of the trade association and sent to the Registration Section of this Association. After the Registration Section reviews them, it shall stamp them with a security seal and retain two copies for use by the Association. The fourth copy shall be stamped with the seal of the Shanghai National Economic Severance Association Against Japan for registration and future inspection, and returned to the factory or business applying for registration to keep. ㊉㊀ The quantity of raw materials and goods registered, in addition to those currently in the store or warehouse, those holding warehouse receipts and customs permits should submit them along with the registration form for inspection by the respective trade association during registration. Only after the trade association has verified that there are no errors can the trade association stamp and certify them. ㊉㊁ After the registration procedure is completed, the Inspection Section of this Association will send personnel to inspect the actual quantity of raw materials and goods stored in the store and warehouse of each factory and store, and the quantity on the warehouse receipts and customs permits at any time to see if it matches the quantity reported on the registration form. If there are any discrepancies, once discovered, they will be severely punished. ㊉㊂ After registering raw materials and goods, the factory or business applying for registration, except for the raw material part where the factory owner explains the situation and requests the Association to allow continued use until the raw materials are used up in order to facilitate work, all goods shall not be sold separately before the Association permits centralized sales. Otherwise, once discovered, in addition to confiscating the goods, the person in charge will be severely dealt with according to law. ㊉㊃ After the registration deadline expires, the Registration Section of this Association shall compile and bind the raw materials, goods, and order contract registration forms of the factories and businesses into volumes according to the industry categories, assign numbers to them, and retain one copy in this section for record, and transfer another copy to the Inspection Section for reference in conducting inspection work. ㊉㊄ These methods shall be implemented from the date of the resolution of the Standing Committee of this Association, and the same shall apply to revisions.</p>
<h3>Transit Tax Only Collected Once</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce responded to the China Chemical Industry Society yesterday regarding the explanation that the transit tax is only collected once, stating, "According to Jianghai Customs Proclamation No. 1611, the transit tax that has already been paid at other customs ports shall be exempted." In other words, the transit tax is only collected once, and it is not collected at each level like the Likin tax. Therefore, in the case of A, B, and C mentioned in your letter, if there is a customs office or branch office set up at any point in A, after the transit tax is collected once, it will not be collected again after passing through other places. A copy of the Jianghai Customs Special Waybill Method No. 1616 is attached for your reference. For machine-made goods, after the principal and surtax of 7.5% ad valorem are paid at the first port of departure, they are exempt from repeated collection when passing through the country. In this transit tax regulation, it is stated that machine-made goods should pay transit tax when transported to various places in the country, just like ordinary local goods of the same type. This item of goods should also pay customs duties once. However, goods that should pay consolidated tax are not included in this example. In other words, cotton yarn, etc., which has already been collected consolidated tax once, no longer needs to pay transit tax. Other machine-made goods that do not need to pay consolidated tax only pay transit tax once. The newly ordered transit tax rules mostly levy 7.5% ad valorem, so the method of exempting machine-made goods from repeated collection in the country is not harmed or changed by changing to transit tax. According to what the Association has heard, when machine-made goods arrive at a certain place and are disassembled and transported to another location for sale, it is possible to apply for a distribution license. Please verify this point clearly and reply before the Association inquires Jianghai Customs again to see if it is still handled according to the old regulations.</p>
<h3>P'ei Chen Elementary School Clothing Donation Drive</h3>
<p>All teachers and students of the private P'ei Chen Elementary School on Route Haig, Shanghai West, in view of the increasingly cold weather and the pitiable situation of refugees clad in rags and suffering from cold and hunger, initiated a clothing donation drive. First, teachers and students voluntarily donated, and then it was extended to relatives and friends. More than 400 pieces of clothing, shoes, and hats have been donated in recent days. It is heard that after the school has donated 1,000 pieces, the teachers will lead student representatives, such as Li K'eng, to the refugee camps for distribution. According to the school, this is the first time in this city that an elementary school has donated clothing to aid refugees.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Union Promotes Boycott Movement Against Japan by Workers of All Countries</h3>
<p>Telegrams Requesting Leadership from the International Transport Workers' Federation and the British Labour Party Executive Committee</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of our sacred war of self-defense and national resistance, the anger of working friends all over the world at the brutality of Japan's invasion of China has spread like wildfire. Our Chinese Seamen's Union expresses its admiration for the stance of justice taken by major labor unions around the world, and sends telegrams expressing its gratitude. The following are the two telegrams sent by the union yesterday to the International Transport Workers' Federation in the Netherlands and the Executive Committee of the National Labor Movement of Great Britain in London.</p>
<p>Telegram 1 To the International Transport Workers' Federation in Amsterdam, Netherlands: The Japanese imperialists, in order to realize their ambitions of aggression, have not hesitated to destroy human peace, and have suddenly invaded us with force, invading our Peiping and Tianjin, and disturbing our Shanghai. We are launching a full-scale war of resistance for national self-defense. Although we strike back at those who attack us, we are actually sacrificing ourselves to maintain world peace. In the two months of the war of resistance, the brutality of the Japanese army in China has been witnessed by all. Simply because they were unsuccessful in their expedition, they used innocent refugees as targets, dispatching troops and aircraft to bomb them recklessly in order to retaliate. The disaster-stricken areas extend to thirteen provinces, especially the major cities such as the capital and Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hankou, resulting in the tragic bombing deaths of over ten thousand elderly, weak, women, and children. As for destroying cultural institutions, disturbing embassies of various countries, occupying churches, and massacring fishermen, these are even lesser matters. With such unbridled actions, there will be no justice or righteousness in the world. This union, leading the national seamen, hereby appeals to your federation to uphold justice and speak frankly, and to inform all member countries of the brutal behavior of Japan's invasion of China, and to unite and rise up to impose severe sanctions on them. Implement the following three measures: ㊀ Boycott the import of Japanese goods. ㊁ Refuse to transport military supplies and various raw materials to Japan. ㊂ Urge your government to implement effective sanctions against Japan. World peace and human justice depend greatly on this. We eagerly await your reply.</p>
<p>Telegram 2 To the Executive Committee of the National Labour Movement of Great Britain in London, and forwarded to working friends all over the world: The tyrannical Japan, having already invaded our Northeast with force, has also sent reinforcements to Ji, Cha, Sui, and Jin, and invaded South China. In fact, they are attempting, on the one hand, to encompass China and monopolize the political and economic interests of East Asia to enrich their poisonous teeth and claws, and on the other hand, to realize Tanaka Giichi's memorial, and to advance westward through our Mongolia to reach Europe and implement a policy of vertical and horizontal alliances, to seize the resources of Europe and the United States, to wield modern weapons, and to indulge in barbaric atrocities. An unprecedented catastrophe for humanity is spreading at an extremely rapid pace. It goes without saying that Chinese women, children, the elderly, and the weak are being bombed and massacred. The flames of their ferocity have also affected friendly peace officers, innocent civilians, neutral ships, and remote ports. If this scourge that threatens world peace and massacres humanity is not removed, there will be no peace in the world. Fortunately, your federation has issued a high-pitched call, proclaiming five resolutions to urge the workers of the world to prepare to "boycott" Japan. Your kindness and friendship are deeply appreciated.

<h3>British Boy Scouts Association Telegraphed the City's Boy Scouts Yesterday Expressing Sympathy</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Shanghai Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps has been serving on the front and rear lines, undertaking various rescue work, and telegraphed Boy Scouts around the world to report Japanese atrocities. It is learned that the British Boy Scouts Association has replied to the city's Boy Scouts, and it is also heard that the Corps has been approved by the China Boy Scouts Association to be reorganized as the First Regiment of the Chinese Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reply from the British Boy Scouts Association</p>
<p>The British Boy Scouts Association replied, "Shanghai British Consulate forwards to the Shanghai Chinese Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps, Upon receipt of your telegram. Chinese Boy Scout brothers, in this critical moment, are not afraid of difficulties and are carrying out rescue work. We express our deep sympathy and congratulations. Your work has been reported prominently in major British newspapers. We hope you will continue your efforts. More details in a letter. British Boy Scouts Association, London, October 17th."</p>
<p>Approved for Reorganization as the First Regiment</p>
<p>In order to prepare the national Boy Scouts for long-term service, the China Boy Scouts Association has issued orders to the councils in various regions to organize wartime service corps. Now, the Shanghai Boy Scouts have been approved to be reorganized as the First Regiment of the Chinese Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps. The staff of the General Headquarters has not changed. A secretariat, command office, propaganda office, and law enforcement office are established above the regimental commander. Each office has a director and deputy director, and several staff members below the director. There are six district corps and a total of twenty-six direct-affiliated detachments. Each detachment has one detachment leader and several squad leaders. In total, the regiment has approximately 1,000 members, of which female comrades account for a quarter. They are all dispatched by the command office to the front and rear lines to undertake rescue, communication, engineering, and other work. Recently, in order to understand the work situation of various service agencies, a work report form has been distributed, which must be signed and sealed by the detachment leaders every Wednesday and Saturday before 11:00 AM and submitted to the statistics section of the command office of the General Headquarters on Tianjin Road, Wu Qing-jun, for collection.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Military Intentions</h3>
<p>— It Is Appropriate</p>
<p>Judging from the overall war situation, the enemy, having tasted the bitterness of our army's strong resistance and being pressured by the international situation, has concentrated its main military objective in Shanxi. It wants to use all its strength to seize Taiyuan and complete the military control of the situation north of the Yellow River, and then coerce our country into accepting a humiliating peace. As for the Shanghai front, it is really for the sake of the "Imperial Army's" face that it has to painstakingly fight on. The enemy's intention in this area is to urgently occupy D场, forcing our army in Jiangwan and Zhabei to retreat in order to regain some of the face lost before. Once this is achieved, they may be eager to stop.</p>
<p>This intention of the enemy is of course an unattainable fantasy. Since the reinforcement of large armies in Shanxi, we have repeatedly won great victories, and the enemy forces have been exhausted. The enemy's five general offensives in Shanghai have all suffered disastrous defeats, and it is clear that it will not be easy to advance further. Moreover, our military leaders have repeatedly declared their determination to resist to the end. Even if the enemy occasionally wins a local victory and wants to stop, we will not let them off.</p>
<p>However, we cannot fail to point out that the enemy's current attempt to narrow the scope of the war is poisonous. The enemy knows that a protracted war is detrimental to them, and they want to end the war by means of a swift battle. Although this cannot fool our country, it can quite cater to the psychology of some third countries.</p>

<h3>The Question of Democracy During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Zhang Naiqi</p>
<p>Recently, some people, upon hearing the word "democracy," immediately think of the following two questions:</p>
<p>1. During the War of Resistance, a strong government is precisely what is needed. Why are we still talking about democracy?</p>
<p>2. During the War of Resistance, we need to support our leaders. Why are we still talking about democracy?</p>
<p>To these two questions, we can give a very simple answer: democracy is civil rights. Mr. Sun Yat-sen has already told us this. Our current War of Resistance is not something that fell from the sky, but simply a new stage of the National Revolution, a further implementation of the Three Principles of the People. Then, who can say that democracy is not needed during the War of Resistance? However, we are unwilling to offer such a simple reason. We want to further study the content of these two questions.</p>
<p>In his "Principle of Democracy," Mr. Sun clearly analyzed the distinction between political power and governing power.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p>"The new country we want to create is one in which the great political power of the country is divided into two parts. One is political power, and this great power must be completely handed over to the people, so that the people have full political power to directly manage national affairs. This political power is democracy. The other is governing power, and this great power must be completely handed over to the organs of the government, so that the government has great power to govern national affairs. This governing power is the power of the government."</p>
<p>He also said:</p>
<p>"The power of the government can be developed, and the power of the people can also be expanded. With this kind of political power and governing power, we can achieve the goals of American scholars and create an all-powerful government for the happiness of the people."</p>
<p>These two paragraphs prove that the development of democracy will not only not reduce the power of the government, but can actually increase it. The lessons that history has given us also show that only a democratic system can thoroughly eliminate all feudal separatist forces in politics and economics, complete a truly unified country, and establish a strong government. The political disputes and the fragility of the foundation of government caused by democratic systems in European and American countries in recent decades are not inherent weaknesses of democratic politics, but rather acquired pathologies of democratic politics. This is because parliaments have gradually become tools of □□ capitalists and cannot reflect the public will of the majority of people. The contradictions within the bourgeoisie are reflected in the parliament, while the unanimous opinions of the majority of the people are not expressed. Let us look at how, after various countries overthrew the feudal system and established a democratic system, the tyrannical power of autocracy was eliminated, but the power of the government only increased. An emperor who wields the power of life and death may seem "unparalleled" on the surface, but where can he mobilize the power of the entire country? A democratic government, even though it is constrained by parliament in peacetime, has a growth of national strength and the mobilization of national power that a feudal government can never match. Let us look again at how, in recent years, the people of some countries have gradually become aware and have gradually been able to elect representatives who represent their own interests, and the foundation of politics has become relatively stable. In short, the weakness of democratic politics is exposed when the parliament cannot represent the majority of the people, when democracy becomes false democracy. What evil does democracy itself have? As for the issue of democracy in our country, the call for democracy before the War of Resistance is different from that after the War of Resistance. Before the War of Resistance, when we talked about democracy, we wanted the government to execute the public will of the people and resist aggression. After the War of Resistance, when we talked about democracy, we wanted the government to concentrate national power, mobilize the people's strength, and fight the War of Resistance to the end to achieve final victory. To be honest, what the people are currently concerned about is not the excessive power of the central government or the concentration of power in the leader, but the fear that the power of the central government cannot reach the local level, and that the leader's will cannot reach the lower levels, thereby weakening the strength of the War of Resistance. I once said that "unity from top to bottom" has been achieved, but there are still some problems in the middle layers. The people want to resist the War, the leader has already launched the War of Resistance, the people want to fight the War of Resistance to the end, and the leader also says that we cannot achieve final victory unless we mobilize the entire nation to participate in the War of Resistance. The leader has completely executed the public will of the people. From the relationship between the leader and the people, it can be said to be extremely democratic. However, there are a few obstacles in the middle layers! From a military point of view, everyone knows that the initial failures in the North China War were due to the fact that a small number of local military personnel still harbored feudal separatist ideas. They were unable to execute the intentions of the central government above, and violated the soldiers' demands for resistance below, which led to missed opportunities and repeated losses of famous cities. If there were no obstacles in this middle layer, and the intentions of the central government and the demands of the soldiers could be integrated, how could this have happened? We also know that in this great tide of the War of Resistance, all corrupt and filthy things will be washed away cleanly, and all obstacles will be eliminated as much as possible. However, washing away and eliminating them in a way that burns both jade and stone and loses territory is too great a drain on national strength! Secondly, in the political sphere, the bureaucratic atmosphere of corruption and stupidity, the consciousness of monopolistic power, and the tricks of political manipulators still remain everywhere. Even enemy spies and traitors who recognize thieves as their fathers are constantly being discovered. Undoubtedly, the policy of compromise, both internally and externally, in the past ten years has caused many evil and corrupt habits to re-emerge. At the same time, many evil and corrupt elements have also taken the opportunity to infiltrate political institutions. Some of them deceive those above and deceive those below, while others flatter those above and abuse those below. On the one hand, they nominally obey but actually disobey, hindering the implementation of the central government's policies. On the other hand, they exploit their borrowed authority to weaken the people's faith in the government. In the event of military setbacks, those who re-propose a policy of compromise and attempt to undermine the War of Resistance will probably be these people. Thirdly, in the social sphere, new and old local bullies who control the rear work and the Baojia system, using it as a tool for personal gain, are also everywhere. For example, the punishment of traitors and the conscription of strong men have become excuses for local bullies to extort money from the common people in many places. In order to cover up their own misdeeds, they cannot but suppress the rise of the people. How urgently the country needs the people to rise up during the War of Resistance, how can these people understand or care about it? These selfish and shameless scoundrels will naturally become traitors and puppets for their own private interests when enemy troops are pressing down on the border. These various obstacles in the middle layer have usurped the governing power of the government above and plundered the political power of the people below. What we are asking for now is democracy, which is to ask them to return the governing power to the government and the political power to the people. In terms of the relationship between the government and the people, we hope that the government can eliminate all evil and corrupt elements who deceive those above and deceive those below, and create a situation of unity from top to bottom. In terms of the relationship between the central government and the local governments, we hope that the central government can eliminate all remnants of feudal separatist consciousness and create a truly unified country. In order to achieve this hope, we believe that the government must first give the people more democratic rights, so that the people can automatically organize to protect their own interests and contribute their own strength. At the same time, public opinion can become the mouthpiece of the people, enough to expose all the evil deeds of exploiting, grabbing, and oppressing the common people, and correct all the habits of monopolizing, controlling, corruption, and stupidity. The thorough execution of this task is not enough to rely solely on the power of thunder above. Even if a network of detectives is set up, I am afraid that it will have little effect. There must be the strength of the people below as a foundation for the strength above to be brought into play. What corrupt elements fear is not the spotty and leaky sanctions from above, but the sanctions from the people who are watching with a thousand eyes.</p>
<p>The great War of Resistance is a touchstone for the entire nation, and also a touchstone for every individual. Who loves the country, who does not love the country, who is progressive, and who is corrupt, will be fully expressed in their enthusiasm for the War of Resistance. In this great tide, we do not need any party consciousness, nor do we need any class prejudice, because the interests of the nation ultimately outweigh the interests of any group, and the pain of being a subjugated slave is ultimately supra-economic. To be more specific, we do not need to overemphasize a person's past history and economic foundation, but only need to pay attention to his performance today. If a warlord participates in the War of Resistance, or a local bully launches rear support, we should immediately regard him as a comrade. The battle lines are too easy to draw, and all general slogans of "oppose" and "overthrow" are no longer needed now. As long as everyone can eliminate prejudices, unite all patriotic people, and at the same time break through affection and sanction all selfish people, the obstacles in the middle layer can be easily removed.</p>
<p>Historically, the implementation of democratic systems has often been in the midst of a great tide. We now have a leader above who executes the public will of the people, many pure and good cadres in the middle layers, and a unified will of the people in the lower layers. The opening of democratic rights and the improvement of the government's governing power have become two things that are not contradictory and cannot be separated. What else is there to worry about? Have we forgotten the meaning of the four words "democratic centralism"?</p>
<p>In short, in order to guarantee the final victory of the War of Resistance, we need an all-powerful government. However, an all-powerful government must have the great strength of the people as its foundation. The purpose of democracy during the War of Resistance is to improve the strength of the people, eliminate the obstacles in the middle layer, so that the people and the leader are integrated, so that the central government and the local governments are integrated, in order to create an all-powerful government.</p>
<h3>A Hundred Aspects of Wartime Japan</h3>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Shishi News Agency: After the Lugouqiao Incident, our reporter immediately went to Japan as quickly as possible and returned to Shanghai yesterday. For a period of three months, Japan was always in a very tense state of war. Because the Japanese police monitored the reporter's movements and checked the reporter's letters, there was no freedom of communication in Japan. Now that he has returned to the motherland, after taking a deep breath of freedom, he immediately took up his pen to draft this "A Hundred Aspects of Wartime Japan," depicting its dynamics from various aspects of politics and society, which may be used as a reference for those who are concerned about wartime Japan.</p>
<p>㊀ Why the War?</p>
<p>Why is Japan at war with China? This is easy to answer. Japan wants to plunder China's resources and conquer China in order to realize its continental policy.</p>
<p>However, they find it inconvenient to say this so bluntly to the countries of the world. Therefore, they have to agonizingly seek some grand and legitimate reasons. The first step is to cover up: "not expanding the incident," "local settlement." By the time the incident expanded to Shanghai, and even the 72nd extraordinary Diet session was convened to increase military spending by 260,000,000 yen, the □□ section, □□, then Konoe also followed in the footsteps of the military and shouted "punish the Chinese government!"</p>
<p>On the one hand, they shouted "punish," while on the other hand, they put on a wonderfully unique Japanese mask, saying that the purpose of Japan's war with China is to demand China's cooperation ("tie-up"), not to demand "territory." The target of Japan's punishment is the Chinese government, not the Chinese people. Japan would rather seek happiness for the Chinese people.</p>
<p>These divisive words may sound very pleasant to Konoe and the various members of the military, but they fundamentally failed to see whether today's Chinese government and people are so easily divided. Just look at the enthusiastic support of the central government by the generals and the people across the north and south of China after the War of Resistance, and their desperate resistance, and you can see how short-sighted and pitiful Konoe and others are.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, Honda Kumalaro Shiha, a senior member of their country's diplomatic circles and former ambassador to Germany, made a severe criticism at a national conference in Shiba Park. He said, "Japan keeps saying that it wants to seek happiness for the Chinese people. I think that before Japan seeks happiness for the people of other countries, it is best to first enable its own people to have food and clothing. Japan itself is a poor country. The people's needs for food and clothing all depend on China. The most developed industry in Japan is textiles, and the Japanese textile industry in Jiangnan accounts for 20% of the national textile industry, and can earn a surplus of hundreds of millions of yen every year. The undershirts, cotton vests, underwear, etc. worn by Japanese citizens are all stained with the benefits of this surplus. But the war has destroyed this huge source of profit. What will the Japanese people rely on to maintain their food and clothing in the long term?" This is truly a pointed comment. Unfortunately, under extreme pressure of speech, those who dare to shout so loudly are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. And what Mr. Honda said, if the reporter had not heard it with his own ears, would never be seen in the newspapers.</p>
<p>The wonderful theory of demanding "tie-up" through war is like slapping someone in the face with one hand and asking them to shake hands and be friends with the other. No country or nation other than the clever Japanese can do this. So Konoe asked the author of the Three Principles, Foreign Minister Hirota, for advice, and received a new magic weapon, saying that he wanted to eliminate the communization of China. He thought that this time he could scare the economic imperialist countries. However, this magic weapon does not seem to have much effect either. The President of the United States, in his speech in Chicago, abandoned his previous wait-and-see attitude and gave an inhuman evaluation of the Japanese army's brutal bombing of unprepared cities and unarmed people, believing that Japan's military actions against China violated the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact.</p>
<p>This forced Japan to reveal its true colors. On October 6, Tatsumo Kawai, head of the Foreign Ministry's Information Department, issued a "bomb" statement to foreign reporters, saying that the world was created for mankind, and that honest and hardworking people have the right to enjoy a happy life. Those who rely on the legacy of their ancestors to possess vast resources, but are lazy and unwilling to develop them, should be eliminated. The distribution of world resources is currently uneven, with a distinction between "holders" and "non-holders." What other means can "non-holders" use to resolve the demand for an average distribution of resources other than war? This statement is Japan's true attitude: you have it, I don't; give me yours; if you don't give it to me, I'll hit you. This is the reason for Japan's war against China. This robber-like confession won applause from foreign reporters, who said, "If you had said so earlier, wouldn't that have been better? We now understand Japan's true intentions."</p>
<p>Kawai's statement, which revealed the dagger after the map was exhausted, aroused great dissatisfaction in the cabinet. At the cabinet meeting on October 8, Ryutaro Nagai sternly questioned Hirota about why the head of the Information Department spoke so rashly. At a time when relations between Britain and the United States and Japan were tense, such an important statement was not understood by the cabinet and was lightly released, which was extremely inappropriate. Cabinet members echoed Nagai and criticized Hirota one after another. Hirota was very embarrassed, and Konoe also said, "This head of the Information Department is really terrible."</p>
<p>㊁ Reuters vs. Kawai</p>
<p>There is a foreign newspaper in Japan run by an American, □□□□□□□, □ have □'s □ say. He said that in this war, Japan has taken the offensive militarily, but in international propaganda, it is completely on the defensive and has been completely devastated by China's attacks. To do propaganda work, you must at least have basic knowledge of journalism. According to the conventions of news, sensational reports are usually placed in the most prominent position to attract readers, and the most unwelcome thing in news is corrective reports. And in general readers only pay attention to sensational reports, and do not pay attention to the subsequent corrections. In this Sino-Japanese incident, the information supplied by the Chinese side and the telegrams taken by Western reporters from China were all based on on-the-spot observations exposing the inhumane behavior of the Japanese army. The telegrams sent by Japan only denied or corrected the communications of Chinese and Western reporters. The war is in China, and the actual situation of the war is reported by Chinese and Western reporters based on on-the-spot observations. Readers will of course gladly believe it, while the denying telegrams sent by Japan are mostly taken from Tokyo. Since Tokyo is not the location of the war, and no Japanese official or reporter stays in Nanjing or other Chinese cities, what materials does Japan have to deny the communications of Chinese or Western reporters?</p>
<p>The above editorial revealed the entire picture of Japanese propaganda. The Information Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs meets with foreign reporters twice a week. It seems that every time they are there to do the work of denying or correcting. For example, on September 22, Reuters had an unusually detailed report on the large-scale bombing by Japanese aircraft in Nanjing and Guangdong. It was sent to London, and all newspapers used this inhumane bombing of unprepared cities and the killing of 2,000 non-combatants as the headline, causing indignation in the British government and public against the Japanese army's atrocities. Kawai, the head of the Japanese Information Department, issued a fanciful statement on this matter, saying that Reuters had no special correspondent in Guangdong, and that the news was provided by a Chinese person surnamed Liang from Guangdong, which was obviously untrustworthy. M. J. Cox, the Tokyo correspondent of Reuters, confronted Kawai face-to-face about this. Cox officially notified the Allied News Agency and Japanese newspapers that this correspondent was ordered by the headquarters of Reuters to solemnly declare that Reuters did have a special correspondent in Guangdong. This person is British and has been a teacher at the Shanghai Municipal Council Middle School for many years. He is an executive of Reuters who is proficient in Chinese affairs. The special correspondent personally witnessed the Japanese aircraft killing 1,000 non-combatants. Reuters does not have the so-called Mr. Liang.</p>
<p>Faced with Cox's tough counterattack, Kawai had no choice but to abandon his armor and flee. Propaganda that is not based on facts can only expose its own ugliness.</p>
<p>㊂ Strengthening the Wartime Cabinet</p>
<p>The problem currently being considered by the Japanese political world is no longer the war, because the war has already begun. The problem that the upper levels of the political world are anxious about is the result of winning or losing the war, and how to deal with the aftermath.</p>
<p>In the space between heaven and earth, even if it is not defeated, with the upward trend of China's national strength today, the courage of the War of Resistance, and the complexity of international relations, Konoe cannot afford the heavy responsibility of dealing with the postwar situation. Therefore, he planned early and organized a temporary cabinet council.</p>
<p>The cabinet council brings together representatives of various forces in Japan to reflect the opinions of people from all walks of life and resolve all minor frictions in order to deal with the current situation. Because it is a combination of various forces, it is no different from various factions sharing the political responsibility for Konoe. From Konoe's own point of view, it is indeed a cardiac injection to strengthen the fragile cabinet. However, it is doubtful how much effect a cabinet council that is pieced together, even pulling together Ugaki and Araki, who are usually incompatible, can have. Moreover, people in the press have reservations about the candidates, such as Kiyoshi Akita and Yosuke Matsuoka. Therefore, even before the cabinet council was established, some people were already questioning its weight. The temporary cabinet official system was approved by the Privy Council plenary session on October 13 and announced on the 15th. The content consists of two articles: first, regarding important state affairs concerning the China Incident, a number of cabinet councilors shall be appointed to participate in the cabinet's planning. The cabinet councilors shall be selected from among experienced people by imperial decree. Second, the cabinet councilors shall be treated as state ministers.</p>
<p>The general election of cabinet councilors will be held with four people selected by the military (two each from the army and navy), three people selected by the political world, two people selected by the financial world, and one person selected by the diplomatic world, for a total of ten people.</p>
<p>Army: General Kazushige Ugaki, General Sadao Araki.</p>
<p>Navy: Admiral Kiyotane Anbo, Admiral Nobumasa Suetsugu.</p>
<p>Political parties: President of the Minseito, Chuji Machida, Acting Committee Member of the Seiyukai, Yonezo Maeda, Independent Kiyoshi Akita.</p>
<p>Financial world: Seinosuke Gō, Shigeyoshi Ikeda.</p>
<p>Diplomatic field: Yosuke Matsuoka.</p>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun editorial on the 14th stated, "The cabinet council is not a deliberative advisory body. Each person treated as a state minister individually participates in the planning of the cabinet. There is a risk of a lack of political clarity. Depending on the selection of personnel, rather than being regarded as a national institution, it gives the impression of a private organ of the Prime Minister. "It also said, "When the current cabinet appeared, some people said that the appearance of Duke Konoe was the 'last resort.' In a certain sense, this cabinet participation is the real last resort. At the same time that everyone is present, there is a feeling that the treasury is empty." It also said, "The people will never believe that absolutely trusting Foreign Minister Hirota in the diplomatic field means that there is no need for any strengthening work. Otherwise, it would make people sigh that there is no one in the diplomatic world. What is more necessary than internal strengthening is the renewal and strengthening of the diplomatic front." (End of the third paragraph, to be continued, the full text is not finished.)</p>
<h3>The Municipal Authorities Establish a Children's Hospital for the Common People</h3>
<p>Madame Kong is also selecting a site to prepare for the establishment of one. In the future, there are also plans to provide considerable education.</p>
<p>Mayor Yu of this city, in view of the fact that after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, refugees have been displaced and children are particularly suffering, has instructed Director Li of the Health Bureau to investigate the situation. According to reports, the average daily death rate of children in shelters and other common people is about 200. Therefore, he instructed Director Li of the Health Bureau to establish a children's hospital as soon as possible to save them. Director Li is actively preparing for this and has received the full cooperation of Director Xu and Section Chief Xia of the Finance Bureau in arranging funding. A children's hospital for the common people has been established at No. 65 Moore Road, with 100 beds temporarily. Work began on the 16th of this month. Children from one to ten years old in difficult circumstances can go there for free outpatient and inpatient treatment. In order to expand the number of beds and enrich the content, we still need enthusiastic men and women from all walks of life who care about the well-being of children to donate clothes, milk powder, milk, and medicines. If you want to donate cash, please hand it over to the Shanghai Municipal Bank branch at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Luyuan Road for collection, and a stamped official receipt will be issued to ensure prudence and prevent impersonation and fraud.</p>
<p>Ms. Soong Ai-ling, wife of Vice President Kong, previously single-handedly funded and ran a wounded soldiers' hospital at the original site of Lido, with outstanding results. Later, she received an order from the Central Government that all private hospitals must be closed. Therefore, all the items in the hospital were transferred to the rear hospital in Suzhou in the interior. Madame Kong, in view of the fact that there are still no children's hospital facilities in society, and that general poor and sick children have no place to seek medical treatment, has long had a plan to establish a children's hospital. Now that the wounded soldiers' hospital has been completed and closed, she has decided to open it in advance. The location at a large Western-style house on Kangnaiduo Road is the most suitable. However, there are still many Christian refugees helped by Madame Kong in that place. Arrangements are currently being made to resettle them separately. It will be established in about a week. It is heard that the hospital specializes in accepting orphaned children between the ages of six and twelve. The entire hospital can accommodate about 100 people. At the beginning of the opening, 60 people will be accepted temporarily. Madame Kong also plans to provide considerable education to the children after they have recovered their health, and to establish contact with the educational institutions run by the China Child Welfare Association, so that the children in the hospital can receive at least elementary school education. Those who have outstanding talents will be selected to study further and receive further education. The rest will be found ways to make them employed, so that they can become useful talents in society. Madame Kong also hopes that there will be the same facilities in large cities in the future. Her contributions to children and the country should not be small.</p>

<h3>Random War Diary (9) (Attached Picture)</h3>
<p>— Special Military Correspondent Chen Wanli from the Central News Agency</p>
<p>October 15th</p>
<p>The sky is much calmer than the previous two days. Although the buzzing of planes still disturbs us from time to time, construction continues on the south bank of the Wenzaobang River. The enemy will never forget the heavy losses at Dachang and Zhenru, but they are only sacrificing their lives in vain. This dream of a central breakthrough will be shattered under our bayonets.</p>
<p>"Frontline Daily" and "Frontline Pictorial" are newly published wartime reading materials, said to be specially provided for the soldiers on the front lines to read. The content is very rich. I saw a picture on the Frontline Pictorial; it depicted a soldier tying a straw man and hanging it on a tree branch. He then tied a rope to the bottom of the straw man, held the other end of the rope, and lay prone in the trench, constantly pulling the straw man. The enemy saw it from afar and thought it was our attack, so they bombarded wildly in panic, wasting a lot of shells. Someone told me this was a true depiction of the battlefield, and I found it very interesting.</p>
<p>Tonight is as quiet as daytime. I rarely hear the sound of cannons, so I should be able to sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>October 16th</p>
<p>I got up at four o'clock in the morning, rushed to Shanghai, and was very happy to see many friends. A little after two o'clock in the evening, I hurriedly returned in the moonlight. Along the way, I saw stretcher bearers carrying wounded soldiers down from the front lines. Their family members stood waiting for the ambulances to arrive. I was deeply moved. I feel that we need to provide faster medical care for our wounded warriors.</p>
<p>October 17th</p>
<p>Fierce fighting is taking place in the areas of Gejia Pailouzhai and Chenjiahang. On one hand, the enemy is trying to advance south (Gejia Pailouzhai) through Dachang to Jianzhenru, completing an encirclement. On the other hand, they are trying to advance west (Chenjiahang) towards Nanxiang, implementing a strategy of central breakthrough. However, the enemy has suffered major setbacks in both locations. There is fierce, heroic fighting taking place in Gejia Pailouzhai.</p>
<p>The enemy at Houjia Muqiao (in front of Miaohang) previously attacked our Xinzhaizhen position, but we inflicted a crushing defeat on them, and even captured a prisoner. He is a private first class in the Second Platoon, Twelfth Company, Third Battalion, Third Regiment, Second Brigade of the First Division, named Tanaka Seizo. He was sent here yesterday.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man with a full beard and a bald head is Tanaka Seizo. He grew up in Tokyo and is thirty-five years old this year. He runs a flower shop in Tokyo. He is a reserve soldier and was discharged from the military in the twelfth year of the Taisho era. After the outbreak of this war of aggression against China, both reservists and retired soldiers were mobilized, and he was forced by the warlords to come to Shanghai. He has been fighting submerged in water for more than a week, and his waist and legs are swollen and painful. His spirit is exhausted to the extreme, so he could not escape and was captured by us.</p>
<p>According to him, the Japanese army in Shanghai has suffered heavy casualties. Generally speaking, the casualties have exceeded half. The Second Division has suffered even heavier casualties, with almost no prisoners taken. The commander of the Kano Brigade and the captain of the Hasegawa unit, both belonging to his own First Division, have also been killed in action. It is verified that Kano, the brigade commander, died in battle at Caojiazha in the eleventh month of this month. His name was Haruji, he was from Tokyo Prefecture, and he was fifty years old. He was a graduate of the 21st class of military officers and had served as an adjunct to the 13th Infantry Regiment and the adjutant to the 1st Division.</p>
<p>We asked him if it was true that General Matsui was injured, and he replied, "I heard that he was indeed injured."</p>
<p>He also said that the Japanese army is currently experiencing great difficulties with food. Soldiers carry dry rations on the front lines, which are distributed once every two days. But after eating the dry rations, everyone cannot quench their thirst, so they randomly drink dirty, raw water, and dysentery is seriously prevalent among the soldiers.</p>
<p>He expressed extreme disgust with this war. He said that both the reservists and retired soldiers unanimously oppose this war, and that Japan's economic strength cannot bear this war.</p>
<p>He is very grateful for our preferential treatment and is even more grateful that he will be able to return alive to Tokyo.</p>
<p>October 18th</p>
<p>The bombing and shelling continue as usual, but the infantry only has minor contact all day. Today, enemy planes scattered six or seven different kinds of leaflets over our positions. Most of them say "Welcome to surrender" and even "We've raised the price!" saying "Those who surrender with this leaflet will be rewarded with two silver dollars." This only exposes the enemy's desperate ugliness and also proves that the enemy is completely helpless in the war.</p>
<p>One type of leaflet even has English printed on it. I don't know if the enemy has accepted the suggestion of foreign journalists and hopes that the British and American troops stationed here will also surrender. This is truly unfathomable.</p>
<p>In addition to "welcoming" our "surrender," the enemy is also trying to provoke and alienate our feelings toward England. Among the many leaflets they have distributed, there is one called "A Diagram of Britain's Exploitation of Chinese Funds," which says "The pro-European and American factions are helping Britain funnel Chinese funds into England without end." After seeing this "Diagram of Britain's Exploitation of Chinese Funds," I think that the enemy planes' strafing of the British ambassador and air attaché was definitely not a misunderstanding. They clearly saw the British flag before shooting at it.</p>
<p>Today, someone took a photo of the prisoner Tanaka Seizo, so I took a few too. At that time, he saw me smoking a cigarette, so he asked for one and also requested to write a letter home to report his safety because, since he joined the war on September 14, the officers have absolutely forbidden domestic correspondence, probably fearing that the truth of the defeats would be spread back home.</p>

<h3>Comforting Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition Opens Today</h3>
<p>More than 700 Pieces of Exquisite Works Displayed on the Fourth Floor of the Great World Company</p>
<p>The Chinese Painting Society, the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Society, and others, in order to comfort the brave soldiers fighting against the enemy on the front lines, specially initiated a calligraphy and painting exhibition to comfort the soldiers. Since the preparation, they have received enthusiastic support from important figures of the party and state, as well as famous contemporary calligraphers. More than 700 pieces of exquisite works have been collected, numbered, and displayed on the fourth floor of the Great World Company on Nanjing Road for public exhibition. The exhibition will be held from October 22nd to November 5th, from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day. Visitors are welcome to visit without tickets. The calligraphy and paintings displayed at the venue are not priced, and people are free to bid and draw lots. There are also methods for people to obtain them. All proceeds from the sale will be used as consolation money, and the Shanghai Consolation Committee will send personnel to directly collect the money with receipts. It is expected that the number of visitors will be very crowded.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Tenth Ambulance Team Seeks Donations of Vehicles and Quilts</h3>
<p>Jiang Fangjiu, captain of the Tenth Ambulance Team of the Pudong Red Cross, yesterday issued a request to the Shanghai charity community to donate ten bicycles and one hundred quilts. It is reported that enemy planes and cannons have been indiscriminately bombing innocent civilians in Pudong in recent days. Towns like Yangjing West and Tangqiao East have been the worst affected. Many people have been torn limb from limb. The team is responsible for the rescue work along the river for forty or fifty miles. Unlike Shanghai, where there are cars for transportation, everything relies on walking, and the work is arduous. Bicycles are specially for the use of intelligence officers to investigate the bombing locations and notify the stretcher teams for rescue. Quilts are for the wounded to cover themselves. Donors are also requested to send their donations to the General Association at No. 25 Ye Hong Road, specifying that they are for the use of the Pudong Tenth Team.</p>
<h3>Film Industry Appeals for Refugees</h3>
<p>Broadcasting Begins Today on Chinese and Western Radio Stations to Raise Funds</p>
<p>The golden wind sends coolness, and the weather is getting colder. Hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled from the war zones are displaced, crying from hunger and cold, and their situation is particularly pitiful. The Shanghai Film Industry National Salvation Association, as fellow countrymen, should answer their call. It has specially joined forces with the Relief Committee to launch a broadcast appeal for donations. Starting at 2:00 PM today, famous male and female stars will broadcast and sing their specialties of Peking opera, drama, singing, etc. on Chinese and Western radio stations (frequency 1040, telephone 94020). It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate generously to help the disaster-stricken people in their hour of need.</p>
<h3>Ambulance Team of the Rescue Association Encountered Danger</h3>
<p>Two Wounded Soldiers Killed on the Spot by Bombing, Ambulance Riddled with Over a Hundred Bullet Holes</p>
<p>The 　 Rescue Team of the Shanghai Rescue Committee, led by Deputy Captain Lei Shude, departed from a certain place in Jiading at 7:15 AM on the 18th to rescue wounded soldiers. When the ambulance was carrying wounded soldiers through a certain town, because the place was located on the front line and enemy planes were releasing signals, enemy artillery fire was concentrated on the area. The team immediately stopped advancing and completely moved the lightly and seriously wounded soldiers out of the vehicle, scattering them around. Within a period of thirty-five minutes, more than two hundred shells landed in the vicinity. Two wounded soldiers were killed on the spot by the bombing. The remaining wounded soldiers, team members, and drivers were all knocked into the ditches along the road. The ambulance was riddled with over a hundred bullet holes of various sizes. Fortunately, the machinery was not badly damaged. After the artillery fire subsided slightly and after some repairs, the deputy captain personally drove the vehicle with the wounded soldiers to a certain dressing station set up by the association for treatment.</p>
<h3>Women's Battlefield Service Corps to Expand its Organization</h3>
<p>Ms. Hu Lanqi, the leader of the Shanghai Labor Women's Battlefield Service Corps, has led her comrades to serve on the front lines with remarkable achievements. Yesterday, she returned to Shanghai on official business and will expand the organization and add another team to depart for the front lines and work hard on rescue work. According to Ms. Hu, the refugees in the war zone are everywhere, homeless, and suffering from cold and hunger. There is an urgent need for refugee clothing, especially clothes for women and children. It is hoped that compatriots from all walks of life will donate generously. Women in the war zone are currently making cloth shoes for the soldiers, so it is hoped that all sectors will donate cloth. The above two items should be sent to Ms. Hu at No. 13 Zhenping Lane, Songshan Road, so that they can be forwarded to the front lines. The merit will be immeasurable.</p>

<h3>Our Army Recaptured Xin Muqiao and Vigorously Advanced Toward Liuhang</h3>
<p>Stubborn Enemy Defending Gejia Pailou and Huanggang • Successively Conquered Important Locations North and South • General Offensive Centered on Guangfu Town • This Morning Our Army Captured Hei Da Huang Zhai</p>
<p>For several consecutive days, the enemy has been attempting to advance on Dachang on a large scale. After our close interception and thorough mopping-up, the enemy has become disoriented and panicked. The night before last, in order to test the enemy's strength, our army launched a counterattack on the entire left wing with concentrated artillery fire. After achieving our purpose, we triumphantly retreated back to our original positions. Starting at 8:00 PM last night, we ordered a general offensive on the entire front, centered on Guangfu Town, and advanced to take Liuhang in order to make the enemy unable to care for both ends and to threaten the rear of the enemy forces advancing on Dachang from the south. As a result of the general offensive, our entire army has achieved considerable gains, making the enemy who crossed the Fengcun Tang to attack Dachang from the side trapped between Gejia Pailou and Huanggang, making it impossible for them to advance. The safety of Dachang can be said to be completely assured from the current war situation. The front-line battle report obtained by this newspaper at 2:00 PM this afternoon is as follows: ㊀ Last night, our army's general offensive centered on Guangfu Town recovered the important locations of Shiqiao and Daizhai southeast of Guangfu Town at midnight. Our army has recovered part of the North and South Meizhai northeast of Guangfu Town. After our army was successful on the left and right wings, it encircled and fiercely attacked the enemy in the center of Xin Muqiao. After a fierce battle, it was also completely recovered by 2:00 AM this morning. ㊁ On the line of Chenjia Lane and Dunwusi Temple, we deployed elite and fresh troops. For several consecutive days, the enemy has been fiercely attacking this line, attempting to directly spy on Nanxiang. After our head-on attack, they no longer dared to try again lightly. Last night, our army began to attack, breaking through the enemy's first line of defense and forcing them to retreat to the second trench. ㊂ The stubborn enemy on the south bank of Fengcun Tang is still entrenched in the Gejia Pailou and Huanggang area. Last night and this morning, they repeatedly attacked our positions in Hulizhai and other places, but were all repelled. ㊃ Along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway in the Huangjiazhai and Zhujiazhai area, there was fierce fighting this morning that has not stopped so far. Enemy planes and cannons are constantly bombing our positions. Our mechanized units were dispatched to meet the enemy, and they have a great advantage. ㊄ Our army continues to make progress in Jiangwan and Zhabei. The situation in Miaohang is relatively quiet.</p>
<h3>We Recaptured Hei Da Huang Zhai</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the Jiangwan army reported at 1:30 PM on the 22nd that the biggest success of our army's counterattack last night on the south bank of the Wenzaobang River was the recapture of Hei Da Huang Zhai. At dusk, we advanced in five routes, with the troops at Dunwusi Temple on the north bank providing support. Our army fought bravely and killed the enemy and advanced rapidly. By 11:00 PM, we had advanced to the vicinity of Shenjiazhai and continued to charge, up to four times. We fell forward and followed each other, advancing without retreating. It was not until 5:30 AM this morning (the 22nd) that Hei Da Huang Zhai was recaptured, posing a major threat to the enemy who had advanced deep to the south.</p>
<h3>Guangfu Our Army Ordered General Offensive Last Night and Advanced Toward Liuhang</h3>
<p>Southern Route Recovered Shiqiao and Daizhai • Northern Route Occupied North and South Two Meizhai • Recaptured Xin Muqiao and Continued to Advance</p>
<p>Last night, our army issued an order for a general offensive on the entire front. Centered on Guangfu, the entire army advanced to take Liuhang in order to threaten the rear of the enemy forces on the south bank of the Wenzaobang River. After a night of bloody fighting, our army has made considerable progress, successively recovering important strongholds east and west of Guangfu, such as Shiqiao, Daizhai, South Meizhai, North Meizhai, and other places. The enemy at Xin Muqiao east of Guangfu was surrounded on the left and right and hastily retreated. Our army tracked the enemy and continued to advance, aiming for Liuhang. The distance between Guangfu and Liuhang is only four thousand meters. If our army can recapture Liuhang and cut off the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, then the enemy on the south bank of the Wenzaobang River will have their retreat cut off and will fall into our army's large encirclement. Advancing on Dachang will be nothing more than a dream.</p>
<p>Last night at 8:00 PM, our army's general offensive began. Starting from Guangfu, we advanced on Liuhang from the north and south routes. All the soldiers were exceptionally brave. As soon as they heard the order, everyone was excited and rushed forward. Although the enemy concentrated their firepower and fiercely bombarded us, they could not stop the advance of our brave soldiers. The sound of killing shook the sky under the artillery fire. Although the enemy stubbornly resisted, their defensive works were completely destroyed under our army's brave and fierce attack. Corpses were everywhere, and countless weapons were abandoned. The enemy retreated in panic. Our army on the southern route completely recovered the two important strongholds of Shiqiao and Daizhai to the southeast. Our army on the northern route attacked the enemy, who stubbornly defended the strong fortifications at Nanmeizhai and Beimeizhai. Under the rain of enemy bullets, our army fell forward and followed each other, charging and fighting in close combat with bayonets and hand grenades, and finally broke into the two villages and occupied part of them. The enemy at Xin Muqiao in the center saw that the left and right sides had been lost and were surrounded by our army on three sides. They had no intention of fighting and hastily retreated. The defeated enemy was in a state of panic and great confusion. This morning, our army is still continuing to advance on the entire front, advancing towards Liuhang.</p>
<h3>Our Army Broke Through the Enemy's First Line of Defense in Chenjia Lane</h3>
<p>Fighting is Still Fiercely Progressing This Morning</p>
<p>On the Chenjia Lane and Dunwusi Temple line, our army also launched an attack forward at the same time last night. Although the enemy stubbornly resisted based on fortifications, our soldiers were incomparably brave and advanced through the enemy's artillery fire and rain of bullets. After a night of bloody fighting, they broke through the enemy's first line of defense and fiercely forced them to retreat into the second trench. This morning, the fighting on this line is still extremely fierce, and our army has made considerable progress.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Attacked Again Last Night and Inflicted Heavy Damage on the Enemy</h3>
<p>Enemy Ammunition Depot and Barracks Were Bombed by Us</p>
<p>When our air force was bombing the Yangshupu area last night, the Yizhong Rubber Factory at No. 134 Chaoyang Road was hit by a bomb and caught fire, spreading to neighboring houses and causing considerable damage. In addition, two warehouses of the Weitong Textile Company on Lan Road also caught fire and were extinguished by fire engines dispatched by the Public Works Department. It is reported that the above locations were all parts of the enemy's military supplies and temporary barracks, so the deaths and losses were exceptionally heavy.</p>
<p>Between 10:22 PM and 10:31 PM, 11:29 PM and 11:36 PM, 12:56 AM and 1:07 AM this morning, 1:39 AM and 1:46 AM, and 2:40 AM and 2:47 AM, our planes launched night attacks. Anti-aircraft guns fired continuously. Bombs fell in the following locations: ㊀ 11:15 PM, Qiqihar Road and Yanshan Road, causing a large fire. ㊁ 12:15 PM, Pingliang Road and Meizhou Road intersection also caught fire. ㊂ 2:55 AM, there was also a fire at Pingliang Road and Qiqihar Road.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces at Gejia Pailou and Huanggang Are Still Surrounded by Our Army</h3>
<p>Attempted to Break Through Once Last Night but Were Still Bravely Repelled by Our Army</p>
<p>Our army's advance at Guangfu poses a great threat to the enemy advancing on Dachang from the south of the Wenzaobang River. Our army north of Dachang is also attacking from the Huangjiazhai and Yujiazhai area along the highway. Our army in the Zhangjialouxia area on the left wing is also striking the back of the enemy attacking from the south. The enemy at Gejia Pailou and Huanggang are thus trapped in a heavy encirclement. After our army attacked last night, the enemy stubbornly resisted and once attempted to break through and counterattack us. Our army's morale was extremely high, and we repelled them in one go. The enemy is holding on to their fortifications and is still surrounded by our army.</p>
<h3>Our Army is Making Rapid Progress in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Has Occupied Three Important Villages • Last Night, Our Army Launched a General Offensive on the Entire Front. On the Jiangwan and Zhabei line, our army also launched a brave attack at the same time. Due to Zhabei's proximity to the concession, citizens of the special district heard very clear and continuous artillery fire, as well as dense machine gun and rifle fire, until about 6:00 PM. After 7:00 PM, it became even more intense and did not stop all night. Our army repeatedly attacked the enemy in the area of ​​Sijing Stadium in the direction of Baziqiao, Tiyuhui Road, Dongzhai, and Hejiazhai in separate attacks. At the same time, our army also launched a fierce attack on 63 Huayuan and Aiguo Girls' School from Tan Jiazhai, Hujia Muqiao, Shuidian Road, and Liuying Road. Under the cover of the artillery, everyone in our army was exceptionally brave, and once approached 63 Huayuan, killing many enemies. The enemy in the North Sichuan Road area was also attacked by our army from Guangdong Street and Dongbaoxing Road. In particular, our army near the Jiangwan Stadium made faster progress and occupied three important villages there, annihilating many enemies.</p>
<p>The Miaohang area was relatively quiet yesterday. Both sides maintained their original positions. However, our army's vigilance was extremely tight. If the enemy comes to attack, it will be difficult for them to succeed.</p>
<h3>Fierce Artillery Battles Several Times in Pudong</h3>
<p>At 8:00 PM last night, just as the troops in Zhabei were fiercely attacking the enemy's Hongkou and Yangshupu positions, our brave heavy artillery team in Pudong once again exerted its power, firing artillery shells at the enemy's bases in the above two places. Each shell was extremely loud, and the houses and land in Pudong were shaken. When the sound of the artillery fire began, it landed in the enemy's positions, and the sound of explosions was heard. The target was extremely accurate. After more than a dozen shells were fired in succession, a fire broke out near North Sichuan Road. The enemy suffered a major threat from this, and more than a dozen enemy warships of various sizes also joined forces to fire artillery at Pudong in retaliation. As a result, a fierce artillery battle broke out between the two sides. For a time, the rumbling sound in the Huangpu River resounded through the clouds. In the fierce battle until about 10:30 PM, our side fired more than one hundred heavy artillery shells. Many shells hit the enemy's positions, and the enemy soldiers suffered heavy casualties. In order to avoid our shells, the enemy warships moved back and forth from time to time and fired a total of more than two hundred shells. Most of the shells landed in the fields of Caijiaxiang, Nanyangjing Bridge, Jiangjiaxiang, Yangjiadu, Tangqiao, and Zijiaqiao. Only a dozen shells destroyed several civilian houses. More than a dozen men and women, including Xiangmin Jiang Chenshi, Zhu Qinghua, Zhang Xirong, Jiang Abao, Lu Jiangshi, Jiang Jinsheng, Chen Shiliang, Chen Dingshi, Chen Yueming, He Dingsan, Jiang Agen, Wu Linjiang, and Jiang Fendi, were killed or injured. At 4:30 AM this morning, enemy warships opened fire again in retaliation. Our army ignored them. The enemy fired a total of twenty or thirty rounds. Seeing that our side did not react, they stopped. At 8:00 AM, five or six enemy planes flew to the rear of Pudong to scout our artillery positions. They lasted for two hours without gaining anything.</p>
<h3>Our Army Attacked Along the Pinghan Railway Line and Advanced to the Matouzhen Area</h3>
<p>Remnants of the Enemy North of Yucheng on the Jinpu Railway Line are Being Mopped Up • Fierce Fighting in Eastern Jin, We Occupied the Heights North of Jiuguan</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] North of the Zhanghe River on the Pinghan Railway, a certain unit of our fresh troops has been bravely attacking for days. It is said that they have now advanced to the Matouzhen area. Most of the enemy forces are cavalry, and most of them have been wiped out. A few remnants have fled north in a panic (Central News Agency telegram on the 21st).</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] On the Pinghan front, our army is pressing towards Cixian. The enemy's right wing is densely firing artillery across the Zhanghe River, fiercely attacking our positions. Fierce fighting is still ongoing (Special dispatch on the 21st).</p>
<p>[Jinan] After a small number of enemy troops on the Jinpu Railway line fled to the north bank of the Tuhai River, they were met with a head-on attack by us. As of the evening of the 21st, they did not dare to invade south. Now our reinforcements have arrived and are preparing a large-scale counterattack. The remnants of the enemy north of Yucheng have been intercepted into several sections and are surrounded and are being separately mopped up. In addition, the roadbed of the railway in the Dongguang area was destroyed by our guerrillas for about a mile, and the enemy's rear transportation is extremely difficult. At noon on the 21st, four enemy planes dropped seven bombs on Ziyang, slightly damaging the iron bridge (Central News Agency telegram on the 21st).</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Military situation, ㊀ The enemy forces attacking Jiuguan have been almost completely wiped out. A certain division of the enemy near Jingxing is attempting to attack Niangziguan again. We have been waiting in strict formation, preparing to meet the attack head-on. ㊁ A certain brigade of our commander launched an attack on the enemy at Jiuguan early on the 19th and immediately occupied the heights north of Jiuguan. Our daredevil team entered Jiuguan and set it on fire. The enemy collapsed towards the highlands east of Jiuguan. The enemy then launched a large-scale counterattack, starting a melee. Both sides suffered heavy casualties ㊂ The enemy at Jingxing, with about one regiment or more, attacked our Falu Ridge and Niangziguan positions near dawn on the 19th. Our defending army met them head-on, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. Our Commander Shi was injured (Central News Agency telegram on the 21st).</p>

<p>[Xuzhou] Enemy planes have raided Jiangsu and Shandong 30 times, all with the aim of destroying our transportation (Special dispatch on the 21st).</p>
<h3>Enemy Army Admires the Spirit of Our Army</h3>
<p>Women and Children Also Love Their Country</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] According to the obtained memo of a Japanese officer, (1) Chinese soldiers who fell behind (that is, retreated) and were pursued by our army often chose to commit suicide rather than surrender. Even though they are enemies, we cannot help but admire their great spirit. (2) Men, women, old, and young in the Guangjin area threw hand grenades at our army, showing that even women and children in China have a patriotic spirit. (3) Corpses continue to be left everywhere, and even a bellicose nation cannot help but feel war-weariness (Central News Agency telegram on the 21st).</p>
<h3>Nine-Nation Pact Conference: Italy Decides to Participate</h3>
<p>Japan Carefully Considers Reply, Eden Explains British Foreign Policy</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the Nine-Nation Pact Conference, Italian officials have stated that the Italian government has accepted the invitation to participate. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Sources in diplomatic circles state that the Nine-Nation Pact Conference will be held in Beijing on the 30th of this month. Representatives from China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries have already been appointed. It is now reported that the French cabinet has decided that Foreign Minister Delbos and the Under-Secretary will serve as plenipotentiary representatives to attend the conference. The representative of Sweden to the conference is expected to be the Swedish Minister to Belgium. (Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After Foreign Minister Hirota received the Belgian government's invitation for Japan to participate in the Nine-Nation Pact Conference, he convened a meeting of key officials at the Vice-Minister's office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3:30 PM. Vice-Minister Horiuchi and various bureau chiefs attended the meeting. They decided on the general outline of the government's reply. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, taking a cautious approach, decided to hold another meeting of key officials today and exchange views with relevant ministries. The proposal will be submitted to the cabinet on the 26th for a formal decision and then sent to the Belgian government. At the same time, the central government will issue an important statement to clarify Japan's attitude toward the Nine-Nation Pact Conference to countries around the world. (Domei News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons reconvened at 3:00 PM today and immediately began debating foreign policy. Foreign Secretary Eden first gave a speech, explaining Britain's policies toward the Far East and the situation in Spain. Regarding the situation in the Far East, he said, "The desire of everyone today is to stop the killing and suffering within China. If the upcoming Nine-Nation Pact Conference can achieve this goal, it will be a great contribution to peace and humanity. If it fails, we will inevitably have to consider a new situation. However, we have great hope for the success of the Nine-Nation Pact Conference, and I reiterate this repeatedly. The British government is determined to do everything in its power to make it a success." Speaking of the conflict between China and Japan, he said that regardless of the final outcome, the result will only be to impoverish both sides and the world. Britain is most aggrieved by this conflict, not only because we have significant commercial interests in the Far East, but also because we were in talks with the Japanese government before the Sino-Japanese war broke out. If these talks had continued and the Chinese government had been consulted, relations between countries in the Far East might have improved considerably. Now these talks have been suspended, and it seems impossible to continue them under the current circumstances. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, the British government has maintained close contact with relevant countries, especially the United States, to find a solution. As a result, the decision was made to convene the Nine-Nation Pact Conference. According to information received here, the Italian government has decided to participate, and the US government has sent Davis as its chief representative. It is not appropriate to speculate at this time what issues should or should not be discussed after the conference opens. What can be said is, "The League of Nations has prepared an agenda for this conference. Therefore, I would like to make a suggestion to the gentlemen of the House of Commons: The proper step for us to take is to consult with the other signatory countries of the Nine-Nation Pact and do everything in our power to carry out the tasks assigned by the League of Nations."

<h3>(Brief Commentary)</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>One of the reasons Japan is hastily using force against China this time is the instability of the European political situation. Therefore, after the undeclared bloody war between China and Japan, it concluded some kind of agreement with Germany and Italy to provide remote support. This move is clearly a gesture towards the Soviet Union, saying, "If you come, you must consider your rear." In fact, Japan's credibility in the international community has long been bankrupt. Who knows if it will unite with Germany and Italy today for support, and then unite with Soviet Russia tomorrow for backing if the situation changes? Germany and Italy, though foolish, will certainly not allow themselves to be genuinely used by Japan to create a second world war. Furthermore, the relationship between China and Russia is completely different from the relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy. Japan considers China a constant annoyance and the Soviet Union an enemy. The first step is to invade China, and the second step is to go to war with Russia. Therefore, China's resistance this time is tantamount to resisting Japan for the Soviet Union. Germany and Italy have always been on good terms with China and have no affection for Japan. However, due to certain circumstances, they have joined forces with Japan. But Japan's strength, after this war, has been exhausted and its tricks have been exposed. If Germany and Italy are not able to use Japan but are instead used by Japan, wouldn't that be a great injustice?</p>
<h3>Our Troops Launch Full-Scale Counterattack, Recapturing Many Key Points</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 11:00 AM on the 22nd that our troops launched a full-scale counterattack, starting at 7:30 PM last night. Soldiers from all directions, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, advanced towards their predetermined targets. The enemy frantically fought back, with anti-aircraft guns, artillery, and machine guns forming a wall of fire. The intensity of the situation was unprecedented since "August 13th." Our brave soldiers braved the artillery fire and fought bravely, making progress in all directions, recapturing many important strongholds, and annihilating countless enemies. The fighting temporarily stopped at 4:00 AM. After dawn, a thick fog enveloped the area, preventing enemy aircraft from operating. Our troops continued to take advantage of the natural smoke screen, pressing on and fighting bravely. They fought fiercely for another four hours, and everything fell silent at 9:00 AM. The situation in each sector is as follows:</p>
<p>Gejia Pailou Area</p>
<p>The Gejia Pailou and Huanggang areas on the south bank of the Yunzao Creek were the center of intense fighting. In order to eliminate the enemy forces on both sides of the Fengcun Pond, we adopted a pincer attack from both flanks and a large encirclement from the rear. Therefore, on the front line of Huguozhai, Sujiazhai, and Xiaochiyuan, we strictly blocked the enemy's continued advance, while attacking their left flank along Fengcun Pond via Tanjiatou and Zhangjialou. Our troops advanced one after another, with no retreat. The enemy's strength was gradually shaken by our encirclement, but because the enemy concentrated a strong main force there, it was difficult to annihilate them immediately.</p>
<p>Chenjia Lane to Guangfu</p>
<p>Our troops made considerable progress on the entire line from Chenjia Lane to Guangfu. Our troops launched attacks from Dunwu Temple, Lao Lu Zhai, Guangfu, Wu Zhai, Zhangjia Zhai, and Zhu Bei Zhai, creating a formidable momentum. The enemy collapsed at the sight of us. Zhangjia Zhai, Wu Zhai, and Nan Mei Zhai in front of them were the locations of the enemy's main force on the right flank. We attacked from both sides, and the enemy could not resist. We captured many of their weapons and equipment. On the Guangfu front, we advanced more than a thousand meters, reaching Xi Erfang via Xinmu Bridge. After our troops recaptured Tang Qiaotou, they turned north and joined the troops at Xi Erfang to attack and capture Shi Qiao. Among them, Daizhai was a point where the enemy stubbornly defended and refused to retreat, and it has been heavily surrounded by us. On the northeast sides of Dunwu Temple, we have recaptured Shengjiazhai, Qiaotingzhai, and Zhu Sanfang, etc.</p>
<p>Jiangtianwan Lukesi</p>
<p>In other areas, such as Jiangwan, we recaptured Lukesi and attacked Liangjiang Girls' School from the East and West Sports Association roads, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. In Miaohang, we also advanced 300 meters east from Guo Lezhai, restoring the point of the Shuixian Temple. Near Houjia Muqiao, many enemies were killed, and many rifles were captured. In Chenjiazhai and Yujiazhai, the enemy resisted stubbornly, so the fighting was very fierce. A certain battalion commander of ours was seriously injured near Lu Zhai while leading the charge. Shenjiawan Zhai was once broken through by the enemy, but it was recovered by our daredevil team by midnight.</p>
<p>Cao Su Wangcun Temple Line</p>
<p>According to a report from our Guangfu war correspondent at 10:00 AM, the enemy at the western end of Wu Zhai was still dreaming when we attacked. Our troops suddenly arrived and surrounded and annihilated dozens of enemies. Many documents were obtained from the enemy corpses and are being examined. On the Cao Wang Temple and Su Village line, our troops also launched a surprise attack. In Lao Dan Zhai, Xin Dan Zhai, Qin Jia Zhai, Meng Jia Alley, and Zhao Jia Bridge, the enemy collapsed and retreated, and our troops bravely pursued, killing and capturing many enemies. Shugou Bridge Station and Yang Zhai south of the Liu River Creek were all recaptured by us. The remnants of the enemy collapsed and retreated to Houjia Zhai, Chen Zhai, and Wang Zhai. In total, in the area between Zhai, Guangfu, and the Liu River, we suffered several hundred casualties, while the enemy suffered several times more.</p>

<h3>Impressions in the Midst of Artillery Fire</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Under the bright moon of the previous night, the car circled along a relatively safe route, like a Taoist priest drawing talismans, stubbornly sending us to the front line in the ×× sector. Fortunately, we were not visited by the flying gentlemen along the way, thanks to the spirit of the Premier in heaven!</p>
<p>However, passing through several small villages and towns along the way, we saw collapsed houses and rubble everywhere. From the lingering aftereffects of the flying shrapnel and gunpowder, we could still smell the remnants of the mad and brutal enemy planes that had just withdrawn during the day or late at night. Some shops that had narrowly escaped destruction, although their doors and windows were tightly closed, and no light could be seen, could still be inferred from the sales of tofu shops that were still grinding and filtering soy milk as usual that the people had not all died or fled due to the enemy's bombing. Such illegal acts of the enemy arbitrarily bombing the people in non-combat areas, besides (1) strengthening our determination to fight and win, (2) further arousing international public anger against Japan, and (3) sowing some bad seeds for their own Yamato descendants, could it be that their sun flag, which seems to have been shot through into a large blood hole by the arrow of human justice, would suddenly be planted on our territory along with the bombs?</p>
<p>The enemy planes' random bombing is not only "unreasonable" but sometimes also "unfathomable." A adjutant on the front line said, "He personally saw an enemy plane flying from our rear and dropping eight bombs on a cotton field of hundreds of acres. The next day at dusk, he saw the same thing again." Is this because the pilot couldn't find a target after flying out and had to drop them randomly to get reimbursed? Or has he realized the illegality of his country's warlords' invasion and is passively implementing his anti-war ideas? I think if it is fortunately the latter reason, then the new development of this kind of situation will inevitably intensify and promote the collapse of Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>General ××, the commander of the ×× division, who was directing operations at a certain place on the front line, also told us a similar unexpected thing. He said, "Today, more than twenty enemy shells were fired and landed one after another nearby, but strangely enough, not a single one exploded, otherwise our whole nest would have been in trouble! At that time, everyone laughed and commented on this matter, some saying 'Heaven helps China,' and others saying 'God protects the General,' but in reality, everyone understood that this was obviously the enemy sabotaging themselves. Otherwise, objectively speaking, it also exposed the enemy's great weakness of ineffective ammunition."</p>
<p>We certainly cannot overestimate the enemy's military strength, but we should not underestimate it either. For example, the artillery shells fired by the enemy a few days ago had the recent year number of Showa 12 on them. If we believe the saying that the enemy's artillery fire is lacking only two months after the start of the Sino-Japanese war, then we are undoubtedly making a mistake of underestimation. However, the enemy used all their magic weapons, such as aircraft, artillery, and poison gas, in their four general offensives in February, but they were still stumped by our heroic and resistant warriors and could not move an inch. They originally worshiped material things the most, so they brought out the newly improved artillery shells, but the results were only so-so. This, of course, reflects that we are using extremely strong and invigorating morale to lash out at the enemy who only relies on material things, and we will definitely have smooth sailing and win every battle to the end.</p>
<p>Now the enemy's fifth and sixth reinforcements have arrived in Shanghai, trembling with fear. However, our heroic soldiers on the front line, who are killing more and more vigorously and gaining more and more experience, only responded with a cold laugh when they heard this news, saying, "We hope they come to Shanghai in batches, the more we kill, the fewer there are; otherwise, if they don't come here, they will eventually go to North China!" What a heroic and responsible statement! The ancients had a butcher who was good at killing cattle, so he had no whole cattle in his eyes. Similarly, these jumping clowns in front of us, in the eyes of our generals who command the wind and clouds and have the ambition to swallow the Big Dipper, have also become the ashes of corpses packed into thousands of boxes to be transported back to Taiwan!</p>
<p>Kill a batch when they come, kill one less – this is not just our soldiers exaggerating early. That day, they captured three genuine Japanese prisoners in the victorious counterattack in the downtown area. From their squeaking confessions, we learned that the enemy army has indeed suffered more than half casualties since the start of the war. They were originally reserve soldiers who had just been transferred and had not yet learned about the war. When they were recruited in Tokyo, they were tricked into believing that they were only defending against the communist army in the concession. Who knew that as soon as they arrived in Shanghai, they were told to go to the front line. For a few days, the food was not delivered, and they were really starving to death... As the prisoner spoke, he disregarded his so-called imperial army's dignity (?) and wept bitterly, complaining endlessly. Such demoralized morale, driven to the battlefield of guns and bullets, and the sound of killing, is not tantamount to driving lambs to feed the tiger's mouth?</p>
<p>Another prisoner said that their headquarters is located in our magnificent New City Government Auditorium. Nearby tall buildings, such as museums, libraries, and gymnasiums, are all protected by anti-aircraft guns. General Matsui, the human butcher who led the general Japanese innocent civilians to Shanghai to die, has indeed been injured and is hiding in the headquarters, barely directing the command.</p>
<p>Since the enemy army launched the war on August 13, their initial strategy of attacking from the wings has been repeatedly hit hard, and their strength has been almost exhausted. Then they requested elite reinforcements, such as the so-called mechanized division of the Kurume Division, attempting a central breakthrough. Although they have repeatedly paid a heavy price, they have gained little and have not been able to easily cross the Lei Pond. Since the central breakthrough plan has repeatedly failed, if they want to change to encirclement on both flanks in the future, the extended front line will inevitably require more than twice the number of troops as before. But how will the small three islands collect so many troops again? In desperation, it seems that they will still adopt the central breakthrough, but we are building fortifications step by step and fighting steadily. No matter which point they break through, they will not touch our carefully prepared barrage and will throw themselves into our long-awaited fire net, guaranteeing to make them follow the repeated failures of the past and collapse and retreat with their heads in their hands.</p>
<p>This is one of our positions on the front line: in front of us, there are enemy and our machine guns, the sound of short bursts of fire, behind us, there are our farsighted and loudly bombing the enemy's accurate cannons, looking into the distance in the sky above the Huangpu River, there are enemy planes constantly firing searchlights high into the sky, and signal flares with red and green colors. Needless to say, this is again our planes showing their power in the Hongkou area,... In such a front-line environment, some fragments of information were actually discovered from my heroic soldiers who are bravely resisting the war (26, 10, 20)</p>
<h3>The Activity of Guerrilla in the Suburban Areas</h3>
<p>Workers, Peasants, and Students Participate the Most; It is Extremely Difficult for the Japanese Bandits to Cope</p>
<p>Beijing Communication: Since the Lugouqiao Incident, followed by the loss of Beiping and Tianjin, the general salvation groups in Beiping, in order to recover the lost territory, expel Japanese imperialism from China, and strive for the victory of the war of resistance, decided to organize guerrilla teams and launch guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>Organizational Basis</p>
<p>There were originally the National Salvation Association, the Anti-Gambling Association, and the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard in the suburbs of Beiping, with more than 30 members. There were 23 people in Wanping 7th District, Qingbaikou, and other places. There were more than 30 members in the Beiping Elementary School Students Reading Club. In addition, there were 152 local militia. These armed elements immediately tried to hide in various places when the Japanese troops occupied most of the 7th District. After the 7th District was lost, they immediately led more than 200 refugees, more than 10 members of the Changxindian Wuwei Group, more than 100 members of the Zhuoxian National Salvation Association, dozens of workers and civilians in Kangzhuang, and 40 to 50 members of the People's Vanguard team who remained in Beiping to participate, actively organizing them and laying a preliminary foundation.</p>
<p>Organizational Process</p>
<p>After the 29th Army withdrew from Beiping, Zhao's 27 troops who went to a certain place in early August were blocked and returned to Beiping in Yangyifang and other places. They immediately decided to organize three independent units that contacted, echoed, and helped each other. At the appropriate time, they would organize a staff group to serve as the overall leadership organ. After August 15, the staff group began to send people to inspect and enrich the organization of various units. Later, student soldiers were secretly deployed in the northeast and west suburbs of Beiping and smashed the Second Prison, releasing more than 500 people. With the consent of the prisoners, more than 200 people participated in guerrilla work. In a few days, they came into contact with the enemy army. As a result, the team killed the brigade commander and one member, and injured one machine gunner. The enemy died eight or nine people, and many were injured. The unit immediately retreated to ×× and other places. Because of the expansion of the unit and the busy affairs, a reorganization meeting was held on September 9.</p>
<p>Organizational Composition</p>
<p>Those who participated in the guerrilla team included farmers and workers, former Northeast Volunteers and political prisoners, and general prisoners. In addition, there were soldiers and security groups, among which there were especially many students.</p>
<p>Impact on the Enemy</p>
<p>The enemy in Beiping does not have many troops. Every day, the same troops enter Xidaomen and exit Dongzhimen, then enter Yongdingmen and exit Chaoyang or Andingmen. Even at the Qinghua and Qinghe stations on the Ping-Sui Railway, the enemy troops only station 40 to 50 people daily. When there is an alarm, they call Xiwan or Xizhimen to temporarily dispatch troops. The enemy originally stationed many troops in Kongshankou Road, Mentougou, and Pingxi Xiyuan, but the enemy troops in Pingxi Xiyuan and other places in mid-September have all been transferred away. Our guerrilla team knows the enemy's situation well, is very active, and attacks various gates from time to time. The enemy army cannot dispatch enough troops and finds it difficult to cope. The enemy army often conscripts laborers inside and outside the city and ravages women. The houses in the villages before and after Qicun and Nanbeiliucun on the edge of the Western Hills have been mostly burned down by the enemy army, and countless people have been killed. Especially when entering Futouling, they kill anyone they see, which is extremely cruel. Therefore, the general public hates the enemy army very much, and the guerrilla team gets a lot of help from the people when it attacks. (11th)</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Attack Changshu Along the River Ports</h3>
<p>Enemy Ships Take Advantage of the Rising Tide; After Two Fierce Battles, the Enemy Finally Collapses and Retreats</p>
<p>Changshu Communication: In recent days, the cities here and the Fushan, Hupu, and Dongzhang City areas along the river have been repeatedly ravaged by enemy planes, and enemy ships have also sailed to various ports from time to time, bombarding our shore, attempting to land. Therefore, recently, each river port has been unusually strained. The situation in each port is briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>In the early part of this month, the weather was cloudy and rainy, and the southeast wind was strong. As a result, the river tide rose greatly. The enemy took advantage of the opportunity and ordered four enemy ships that had gone to the outside of the Fushan port on the night of the 7th to fire on our shore along the Hupu port area. However, because they were still far from the shore, the bullets all fell into the river. On the night of the 8th, the enemy took advantage of the strong wind and heavy rain to launch a large-scale attack on the Fushan port with wooden rafts and bamboo rafts. Our army waited until they were close to the shore and used dense rifles and machine guns to sweep them. The enemy used small steel cannons to bombard us. After three hours of fierce fighting between the two sides, our army, because it was waiting in ease, had an absolute advantage and finally repelled the enemy. The next day, due to the rapid tide, the bamboo and wooden rafts used by the enemy were all scattered. Hupu port also had wooden sections drifting in. On the evening of the 11th, the enemy ships sailed from downstream and docked outside the Baimao, Xu Liujing, Hupu, and Geshān ports, with a total of more than 35 ships. That night, they also used rubber boats to sail to the shore, and the ships used artillery to cover them. Our army also fought back fiercely all night, and it did not stop until dawn. The enemy suffered many casualties, and the bodies mostly fell into the river outside Hupu port. Our army also sank four enemy rubber boats, and a cannon in the boat also fell into the river. A giant bomb fell in the countryside of Guijia City, but it did not explode. The bomb was about three feet high and was manufactured by our Shenyang Arsenal in the 11th year of the Republic of China. Now it is used by the enemy, which is very regrettable. The bomb has now been moved to the Old Wu City District Office for preservation. Many other unexploded small artillery shells of the enemy have also been picked up in the wilderness. This was the most severe two nights of the 8th and 11th. From the evening of the 14th, the enemy took advantage of the tide and had two ships intending to attack Baimao port. Fortunately, the wind suddenly changed in the middle of the way, and the northwest wind blew strongly. An enemy ship was stranded in the Laoshusha area outside Baimao port and could not withdraw. The next morning, we discovered it and immediately gave it close surveillance. Unfortunately, due to insufficient firepower, we could not bombard it. From the 15th to the 17th, the wind did not change, and the enemy ship was still difficult to leave, but it seemed to be protecting the ship to wait for the high tide and then leave. According to visitors from Fushan, a giant ship docked outside Fushan port on the 14th. He witnessed at 9:00 PM that night that two of our planes flew to drop bombs, hitting as many as seven. Although the ship fired artillery in a panic, our planes all flew back safely. Then the ship caught fire, but it was extinguished after a while.</p>
<h3>The Garrison Headquarters Announces the Protection of Merchants and Civilians Transportation</h3>
<p>Police Officers and Members Illegally Extort; Those Who Commit This Act Will Be Dealt with Strictly According to Military Law</p>
<p>Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued Announcement General No. 155, stating: During the wartime period, the transportation of goods by merchants and civilians is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood and is of great importance to the long-term war of resistance. In addition to strict investigation to prevent traitors from aiding the enemy and to prevent merchants from manipulating prices, the transportation of goods by legitimate merchants and civilians should be protected and facilitated. It has been found that police officers and members of local agencies and organizations in the suburbs and towns along the way or on the streets of this city illegally extort money from inland merchants and civilians who transport goods to Shanghai by ships. This is really disregarding discipline and harming the people. It is necessary to issue a notice and inform everyone. If such incidents occur again in the future, once verified, they will be dealt with according to military law. The victims of the merchants and civilians are allowed to report to this headquarters for strict investigation in order to maintain commercial transport and uphold the law. In addition to the notice, a public announcement is made for all to know. This announcement is issued by Commander Yang Hu.</p>
<h3>Comforting Soldiers in North China</h3>
<p>Women's Comfort Association Sends Comfort Goods; National Pharmaceutical Industry Levies Special Donation</p>
<p>He Xiangning, chairman of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Women's Comfort Association for Soldiers Fighting in the War of Resistance Against Aggression, sent out four truckloads of comfort goods yesterday (the 21st) afternoon. These included 150 comfort bags (specifically designated for air force soldiers), 2,500 cotton vests, 1,000 pairs of gloves, 2,000 pairs of earmuffs, 2,000 pairs of socks, 200 sets of thermal underwear, 50 cotton quilts, and 200 sets of clothing for wounded soldiers. She requested that Madam Chiang, chairman of the Nanjing General Association, distribute these to the soldiers fighting in North China. The value of this batch of comfort goods is approximately 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, in order to raise funds to comfort the soldiers, issued a notice to its members yesterday stating: "With the start of the full-scale war of resistance, the attainment of final victory depends on whether the entire nation can arouse its conscience and contribute all it has to the country. Now, the Songhu War of Resistance has already inflicted heavy damage on the brutal enemy and has been praised by the international community. The North China War of Resistance, which is vital to the nation's lifeline, sees our loyal and brave soldiers fighting fiercely, defending the country with a spirit that deeply moves and respects our entire nation. Various groups in this city have specially organized a North China Soldier Comfort Delegation to express their respect by going north in the coming days to comfort the soldiers fighting in North China. Soldiers risk their lives and forget their own safety to fight for the survival of the nation, and the people should actively support them. The Northbound Comfort Delegation is an important matter. Therefore, after a joint meeting of the association's executive and supervisory committees, it was decided to levy a special donation from all members for two months, starting from now, to be handed over to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for the needs of the northbound comfort mission. We sincerely hope that everyone will share the same hatred for the enemy and generously donate what they can. This is what we earnestly hope for."</p>
<h3>National Products Movement Association Discusses Relocating Factories</h3>
<p>Formulating Concrete Plans to Offer the Authorities for Reference</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Movement Federation is scheduled to hold a meeting today to discuss the issue of relocating factories in the city. The association's circular reads: "Dear Sir/Madam, this association has received a letter from the Design Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, instructing this association to work with the China General Federation of Industry to formulate concrete plans for the relocation of factories in this city, to be offered to the authorities for reference, etc. This association is scheduled to hold a meeting to discuss this matter at 5:00 PM on the 22nd of this month (Friday) in the conference room on the sixth floor of the Pudong Building. Please ensure that you attend on time. Shanghai National Products Movement Federation."</p>
<h3>Two Railway Bureaus Add Deputy Directors</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways are vital arteries for transportation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Since the war of resistance, enemy aircraft have indiscriminately bombed along the lines. Our country repairs them as soon as they are damaged, striving to maintain them. Therefore, the arduousness of the work of the two railway bureaus is widely acknowledged. The Ministry of Railways, recognizing the importance of the two railways' missions, has specially added the position of Deputy Director. Lu Futing has been appointed to fill the vacancy and took office in Wuxian a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Charity Federation Focuses on International Propaganda</h3>
<p>Collecting Photos of Enemy Atrocities to Send to Our Ambassadors in Europe and America</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association, in view of the fact that the violent Japanese invasion of Shanghai disregards humanitarianism, and indiscriminate bombing has made it difficult for non-combat areas and non-combatants to escape, with countless refugees and rescue workers being killed or injured, in order to expose their atrocities to the international community and awaken the sense of justice in the world, is collecting more than sixty photos of various atrocities and sending them separately to our ambassadors in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium: Gu Weijun, Wang Zhengting, Guo Taiqi, Cheng Tianfang, and Qian Tai, etc., in order to carry out international propaganda. The association properly sealed and mailed the photos yesterday, which will certainly have a significant impact on international opinion.</p>
<p>Youth in Wartime, Issue 18</p>
<h3>Consolidating the Front Line of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhen</p>
<p>Earlier this month, we received a letter from Mr. Yan—who is over fifty years old—expressing great concern about national affairs and providing us with three methods to consolidate the rear-area front line of resistance. We have specially excerpted them below for public discussion and reference. —Editor's Note</p>
<p>㊀ Resist Enemy Goods—Seeing reports that the enemy is setting up customs in Zhabei to collect taxes is certainly hateful, but their promotion in the market must rely on the assistance of traitors. The way to crack down on this is for each industry to supervise and report on each other. Those who violate the rules should be subject to the death penalty. If someone knows the situation but does not report it, or makes false accusations out of spite, they should be punished in the same way. Once sales are stagnant, imports will inevitably decrease, and the illegal customs will become a mere formality.</p>
<p>㊁ Organize the People—In the interior, rigorously implement the Baojia system, with county and municipal administrative chiefs bearing full responsibility. The quality of its implementation should determine the ranking of their performance. If an unexpected incident occurs, officials and the people should be jointly punished. In cities, implement the neighborhood organization system, tasking relevant public organizations to carry it out forcefully, with strict rules and regulations. If there are difficulties, those in charge should find ways to resolve them.</p>
<p>㊂ Purchase Agricultural Products—The autumn harvest has already begun in various places. Although the Four Banks are handling collateral loans, this may be too slow to address the urgent need, and it may be difficult to prevent traitors from buying up supplies to aid the enemy. To remedy this, the government and the people should do everything they can to purchase on the spot, the sooner the better, to prevent traitors from getting there first.</p>
