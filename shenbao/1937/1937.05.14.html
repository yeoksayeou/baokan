<h3>日木總選結果的解剖（上）</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>假使某國眞有公正的選舉，那麽，看某國總選的結果，就等於看某國國內社會諸勢力關係的一種說明了。但是，從議會主義發生到現在，不但日本，任何資本主義國的選，都不能是眞眞公正的。不過，由於社會的矛盾越來越强，無法掩飾了，由總選舉的結果，也就可以看出國內諸勢力消長的一般實况。</p>
<p>我們從日本此次的總選舉，指出目前日本社會矛盾的一般實况吧。</p>
<p>在所謂，凖戰時的國家總勸員的方針下，一部份金屬資本寡頭政治家（如現藏相結城及現日本銀行總裁池田成彬等）與軍部，顯然是站在領導地位上的。內閣部理林大將，不過是一部份金融資金家與軍部間的聯繫人吧了。軍部給與林大特的任務不外是：編成空前的大預算，組織可以實現統制強化的政府，並解放與軍部衝突的議會。—不，這不但是給林內閣的，以後的內閣也决逃不出這些圈套。</p>
<p>軍部給興內閣的任務，也足以代表一部份金融資本家的企圖。因現階段的日本資本主義，除了靠軍需工業的景氣，就不能在任何的景氣；除了統制強化外，就不能實現獨佔的發展。現藏相結城豐太郎卽前興業銀行的部裁，現日本銀行練裁卽所謂三井謀將，”並且是與法西斯運動密切關係的池田成彬—從這關係上看，一部份金融資本家，軍部，與林內閣的關係是很顯明的。</p>
<p>空前的軍事大預算案通過了，議會也照軍部的要求解散了，可以實現統制強化的“企書廳，也大半弄出眉目來了，可是，解散後的總選，這總迭的結果，不但無利於林內閣。並且，新議會的反政府派，仍佔多數。林內閣若不總辭職，便只好再來一次解散。然而，卽使再解散，那結果，也决不會於林內閣有利的。只因林內閣不能抑制林內閣政策下，所引起的物價飛騰，這就是以摧毀林內閣的壽命，不用說其他。</p>
<p>林內閣所遭遇的因難和打擊，事實上也就是日本金融寡頭政治及軍部法西斯之一派所遭遇的。但，便是林內閣了，並不能說明金融寡頭政治的失勢，也不能證明日本法西斯的退潮，這是很明顯的。</p>
<p>不過，自“二•二六”事變以來．“合法派”法西斯是常佔優勢的。此次總選的結果，不能不說，法西斯進展已顯出了一時的萎弱。至於金融資本家方面，至多只能說是池田與結城所代表的系，遭遇了非常輕微的頓挫吧了。因在現存制度下，任何人出來組閣，都不能不看着資本家的馬頭行事。林內閣可以倒，結城等可以下台，但金融資本家的代理人，在目前是隨時可找到的。便是代表日本資本家利益的對華政策，也决不會有絲毫根本上的改變。</p>
<p>解散議會後，林大將本希望新黨出現，但因貴族院議長近衛公不願出頭組織新黨，新黨的空氣便沉寂下去了。新黨不能成立的原因很多，但最重要的而且是有决定性的原因，却是由於國外形勢的轉變。那便是，中國的統一完成，戰爭停止，全民族一致對外的空氣正抬頭，使林內閣的對華政策不能有多大進展，因此，打破了日本人民的幻夢，更感覺到生活的重壓，更引起對政府的反感，法西斯運動，在如此條件下，就不能不受到挫折了。本來爭取殖民地，在目前是法內斯發展的一個重要條件呵。</p>
<p>法西斯的一時不振，再從林內閣的挫敗來說明吧：</p>
<p>總選的結果，林內閣的與黨昭和會，由原有的二十四議蓆，减退到十九了，國民同盟也僅保持原狀（十一席）：其他具有法西斯性質的會派：政治革新協議會五席，養正會一席，鄕軍同志會一席，皇道會一席，明倫會一席，東方會十一席，大日本靑年黨一席，此外有中立的一二十五席即將上各派席數合計，也不過估現議席繼數四百六十六的百分之二十。何况以上各小會派，並不定都表示支持內閣。例如東方會的領袖中野正剛，便早已表示反對林內閣了。</p>
<p>可以用中野正剛來代表法西斯的合法急進派（中野正剛是極端贊美板垣中將相石莞大佐的。然而這兩人便是“一八”更變的“大功臣”，也即是現軍部內所謂“急進派”），但東方會此次也不過增加席吧了。</p>
<p>顯示一大躍進的是社會大衆黨，由原來的二十席，增加到二十七席了。其他—日本無產黨（前　農無產協議會，保持原勢三席）。政友會增加一席（一七五）。民政黨减少二十六席（一七九），但仍是第一黨。</p>
<p>總合反林內閣的議席，約四○一，估絕對多數。（未完）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>英帝國會議的前途</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>在英王加冕典禮轟動了全球之後。世人所注目的就是今日開幕的英帝國會議。這個會議的中心問題是什麽。現在還無從確知在英政府方面透露出來的消息也各不相同。三月九日據英外相艾登宣稱本屆帝國會議中最主要的問題是外交政策上月英首相鮑爾溫則宣佈。着本屆帝國會議所要討論的。有㊀外交問題㊁國防問題㊂憲法問題㊃商業海運與航空交通問題等。可是參加帝國會議的南非代表最近却直截了當地說這次會議祇不過是一個經濟會議。是奧太華會議之績。在我們看來。這次會議中。外交和經濟大約是並重的。現在請就這兩大問題來檢討一番。</p>
<p>先從美國的外交來講。現今的世界形勢。與九三一年。顯然大不相同了。以往英國的外交政策雖徘徊於集體安全與孤立主義的兩途。然而只要國聯的威信存在英國的安全就比較有着保障。這一點是英國外交家始終認識的帝國的自治領。對於國聯這一機構向來也非常重視。自從一九三一年以後。侵略國把盟約撕得粉碎不論在歌洲抑在東亞英國都受着侵略的威脅。外交政策何所適從。當然成了一個問題。在歐洲方面。為了自身的安全。英國不能不與法比聯絡。以保障此國的安全。防止德國的侵入。這樣的政策。加拿大等自治領未必甘願接受。在這次帝國會議中。自有共同協商的必要。在遠東方面。英國目前的外交政策。仍徬徨不定。與美國合作共同來對付日本呢。抑與日本妥協。保全太平洋的原有勢力。這些問題也得與太平洋上有關的自治領作一度協商。因為英國的自治領不但在內政上有絕大的獨立權限。並且對外也有個別的政策。譬如加拿大自治領對於日本就有其個別的主張。一九○九年為了栘民問題。加拿大曾與日本締結君子協定。華盛頓會議後。英日同盟的遽爾取消加拿大的反對。亦極有力量。所以要知道將來英日究否能在遠東覓取妥協之道。英帝國各自治領的態度。實很可注意這是與中國有切身利害關係的。我們對於這次英帝國會議最所關心的也就在此。</p>
<p>其次講到英帝國會議中的經濟問題。這問題的發展興將來的世界經濟合作有密切的關係。自從一九三二年奧太華協定成立後。英國由自由貿易而走上保護關稅政策。造成了集團經濟的趨勢。使各國關稅壁壘愈築愈高。因此引起的世界經濟合作運動。其成功與否的主要關鍵就在這次帝國會議。如果這次會議在帝國的經濟政策上。沒有商定改弦易轍的辦法。那麽歐洲各國推定比首相齊蘭進行减除貿易的障碍。以恢復經濟繁榮的舉動。就不免徒勞無功。我們知道。英國歷來對於農集進口限額制度。是根本不願意取消的。而且欲謀經濟合作。必先普遍减低關稅。取消最惠條歎之類。可是關於這問題。鮑爾溫也說過英國政府特別注意於最惠條欵的維持的話由此看來。這次帝國會議對於奧太華協定的精神大約仍舊要維持下去。果眞如此。那麽。所謂世界經濟合作。恐怕將如一九三二年的世界貨幣會議一樣。弄得英美不歡而散了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>攔輿告狀</h3>
<p>— 乃一</p>
<p>京滇週覽團現在已在歸程中了。靠了報上的通訊，週覽團告訴我們許多可貴的見聞；也因之使我們間接多了些知識，明白了不少黔滇各邊省的賓况</p>
<p>從報上的通訊看來，我們知道週覽團所到之處，沿途的建築物等等，是都經粉飾一過的，以期週覽團諸君駕臨之際，隨了鞭砲歡呼之聲，可以給一個蓬蓬勃勃的印象，這用心是苦的，然而“打腫了充胖子”的結果，小民們則更“死要面子活受罪矣。可怪的却是有時這些“粉飾”又不能從願，例如某報上的“週覽紀略”，“從安順附近直到安南，近二百公里之間，沿途都能間斷的看到芙蓉烟花。山𡼏中距公路較遠的地帶尤多。……據云是因常局以觀瞻所繫，把在公路附近已種的烟苗，悉令翻除，但鴉片苗生殖力甚強，經雨水潤澤之後，死而復活，到現在又開了花。所以花節雖過，仍留一綫眼福。”</p>
<p>這自然是不幸得很，未能把人的眼目遮掩過去。不過這還是屬於表面的。據中央社九日安南電云：“禇團長語記者稱︰自京出發以來，沿途所接各縣人民訴冤呈狀極多：檢查各狀內容，人民所遭非法處置之苦，殊為慘重。本人現無權過問，返京後，當將其分呈行政院司法院，盼望將一切不合法案件，予以嚴厲糾正，以維法紀，而保障民權。”這絛電訊說得很含混；但是“人民所遭非法處置之苦，殊為慘重，”却可以想見；在粉飾街道，盛宴招待，夾道迎送之外，小民們居然還會偷偷地向週覽團告狀，這是出於沿途各縣當局的意外的吧？而在讀了那些歡迎的盛況之餘的我們，可也想不到小民們居然敢大胆如此，然而，於此却也更使我們想到他們受苦的慘重”。各地雖有大大小小的衙門，却都非他們“訴冤呈狀”的地方！</p>
<p>現在小民們自然祇有靜待褚團長“返京後”的處置；我們呢，也且看“將一切不合法案件，予以嚴厲糾正”者，究竟有若干件！</p>
<p>但如果我們的希望不算太奢，則實在也不僅以平反“一切不合法案件”為滿足，因為等有了“冤案”，則人民所受的苦楚，巳經太“慘重”了。</p>
<h3>漏關</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>——山行雜什</p>
<p>把全副怠倦的心情，寄托在伕頭的身上，揮着汗，望了前面的村落，不知是這一夥里的那一個，仰了𩓐子眼睛巴巴地——</p>
<p>——多快，離開黃峭崗又是八十里了呵！跟着，好像不肯讓這句話落空，有人就補了一句：“那山根，不是酒店啞麽！”說着，還向老張看了一眼。</p>
<p>對於這，老張很明白，把長的包頭解下來往空間一揮，讓聲浪打着呼哨，狠了心：“少走十里也罷”！隨着，將手里的桃木棍子往上一揚！！</p>
<p>——今晚歇在酒店啞嘍！</p>
<p>這是－個極小的村落，河水打黃峭網蜿蜓的流下來，到這里更加寬闊了，因為正當陰雨連綿的天氣，水漲得多了，距離岸邊至多只有二三尺高，急漩着，結成了數不淸的渦，再向下游沖擊過去。那一頭緊靠在山根，水草密茂的蓋着水面，這一頭沿了河岸是條官道，環形的包圍過去。說官道，其實也不寬，旁側的山坡傾斜的揷在靑空里，一排矮小的屋子靠了山根埋下根基。在這一列房子的當中，守在口上的是“查緝特貨繳付稅欵”的騐關，對面，在河里還停放了兩隻沒有蓬的小船，船梢有一面白旗子，耐不住蒸熱的垂下了頭，看不淸上面究竟有些什麽字跡。</p>
<p>洽在夕陽，紅的雲塊像紙剪樣的貼到水面上。屋子有限，容不了這許多過客，好在是熱天用不到厚的鋪蓋，於是分開了，－部移到左鄰，一部則靠貼了口上的關卡住到搭有茅棚的底下。</p>
<p>夜了，周遭都是一片漆黑，夜鳥拉長了呌聲掠過長空，一霎眼，又像以前般的回到靜寂里。不知怎麽總睡不着，彷彿有種種的心事捺不下去，夜之風吹着對面的水草嘩嘩地發山一陣磨擦的響聲，山玻上偶爾的還能聽得到一兩聲猴子的啼呌。</p>
<p>突然的，睡在關子裹的緝查員㗭㗭嗦嗦地起來了，是兩個人，好像在經過一度的什麽商議，慌張地握了一盞並不明亮的風燈走出來，一個年紀大點的衝着說：“這回看你還往那裏跑，頭兒進城，哼，也該我們吃一着了呵；”笑聲揚溢着，鷺鷥一樣。</p>
<p>隨後，他們把風燈往前面隨便的照了一下，大的發出了警告：“啊，水聲！”這簡直是一幕奇突的戲劇，跟了這騷擾，我和老鐵也起來了，站在河邊往遠處瞭望一下，除了一片灰濛的月色和波動的水草以外，什麽都沒有。這舉動，大概引起了他們的不快，拿風燈在我們的臉前幌一回，到底佔了點外路人的便宜，並沒有遭受禁止，只勸告着“不能聲響“這意思我們明白，是怕“打草驚蛇”！</p>
<p>夜風很大，等了半天什麽都沒有，年小的一個顯出不快活的樣子，而大點的一個自信心頗強，把帶出來的大號電筒往水面上連連地照射幾下，彷紼幾條巨蟒雜亂的撲到河上，水，依舊是一個個的渦流，什麽都看不見，這才懶散的又走回去。</p>
<p>他們並沒有睡，被企望的心緒支配着，坐在那長凳上，不時的拿電筒照下山巔，又照下茫茫地路上。這之後，隱沒在遠處水草裏起了陣急驟的聲音，好像划槳打水面似的，於是，大的拖了小的，一個箭步跳下了停靠在岸邊的小船，拍搭，拍搭的濺起了水花，往有聲音的地方直衝過去。</p>
<p>不久，他們帶回了另一隻小船，船上有兩個男人，滿臉靑焦的顏色，抖着，船板下有十幾個白色包子，擺在他們的臉前，打起官話來是“漏關”，空口說白話當然是無用的，於是，一捲票子塞到他們的手中，換來了一串得意的笑聲，把手一揮—</p>
<p>船去了，水草打着水面，顫抖的臉色和巧小的船隻又消失在一片蒼茫的月色裏，周遭，依舊是死樣的靜寂。</p>
<h3>薔薇</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>小園里的薔薇又開放了。</p>
<p>每次當薔薇花盛開的季節，我只要看到小園里那叢有刺的籐蔓上，躱着一朶朶的，紅的白的薔薇花時，總會懷念起死去了將近二十年的祖母來。</p>
<p>祖母死的時侯已經七十六歲了，我那時還只八九歲年紀，因此，對於她的死，有點茫然的，不過，她的愛我却是使我永遠也不會忘記的。</p>
<p>祖母的－生是非常勤儉的，她二十多歲，便守了寡，因為沒有一個孩子可以繼承宗祧，就向一房近族里去過繼了一個兒子來，靠了兩間破舊的右屋，把幾塊荒蕪的山地墾着，生活總算還能够過去。</p>
<p>她從年靑一直做到死，沒有讓她有一個休息的機會，每天她總是在幾塊山地里栽培一些樹木，晚上坐在一盞煤油燈下做着縫紉，雨天則坐在家里編織草鞋賣。她把一片枇杷山，一塊楊梅山都收拾得非常好，而門前的那叢竹林和屋後幾畝茶葉樹，更是村中人見了誰都羨慕的，但是到了暮年，她的境况更壤了，甚至到苞山的一隻寺院里去看看家，或替和尚們洗洗衣服，來維持殘年生活</p>
<p>祖母在生的時候很愛花，我們天井里的花藥壇上什麽花都有，尤其是薔薇花，在我們周圍差不多全用薔薇刺築着瀋籬，那刺條是密密地連一頭小雞也不容易鑽得進的。大門前和後門口更有兩堵很高的薔薇照牆，每當薔薇花盛放的時候，藩籬上點綴着一朶朶紅的白的花朶，讓馥郁的芬芳在空氣中流動着。</p>
<p>祖母每天早上，總要帶着一把剪子，去剪裁那些多餘的枝條，或整理一些零落的花蕾，不隨便地讓人家攀折一朶。我的愛薔薇，也許是由於祖母的遺傳吧！但是我是歡喜的是白薔薇：因為我覺得紅薔薇雖然嬌媚鮮艷，可總不及白色的來得素凈高雅，不過當紅白兩種開放在一起時，却又另有一種美艷華麗的風姿了。因此，幾年以來我總不能忘懷那織綴如錦的花籬，有時偶然在別處花圃中看見了－個薔薇花架，也會使自己</p>

<h3>賽金花</h3>
<p>— 陳禾製</p>
<p>十九</p>
<p>北京被聯軍攻陷後，那景象真是，慘絶人寰，不堪卒睹，尤其是婦女，她們平時受盡了種種欺騙和侮辱，在戰時則受兵士，和敵兵的蹂躪，但是又向誰，却訴寃呢？洋兵初進京城，便遍尋婦女，發洩他們的獸性，京城婦女幾無一可幸免者。這時候的賽金花幸而在西洋時，學會了洋語，並詢得，聯軍統帥瓦德齊是往昔友好，的消息。</p>
<p>想起，祖母手植的薔薇藩籬來，從那一朶余的薔薇花影裏，我彷彿見到了祖母的慈祥底笑容。</p>
<p>在祖母過世以後的第三年，我的父親也接着去世了。於是，爲了生活我便跟着母親離開了温暖的家，離開了親愛的故鄉，翌年返鄉掃墓，那些薔薇薇籐已經給人砍折得不成個樣子，周圍的藩籬却連一點痕跡都没有了。</p>
<p>於是我將那些薔薇移植到祖母的墓傍，但没有多少時候又讓那些刈草的小童來砍敗了，不過現在每年薔薇花開的時候，也有幾叢野玫瑰會寂寞地在墳墓的四周爬着，散佈着濃烈的芬芳，來伴墓中的孤魂的。</p>
<p>小園里的薔薇又開放了。</p>
<p>默默地，我伸手擷下了一朶白的一朶紅的薔薇，來插在祖母的墳上。</p>
<h3>斷指諫父的悲劇</h3>
<p>凡事弄到要人疏諫，則其情勢之嚴重，可想而知。找國古時候對於皇帝進言，曾有過“諫院”之設。但自鼎革以來，疏諫這一類的事情，就早經廢棄了。不過相類似這一種行為的事情還是有的，比如年前有幾個日本士兵反對他們當局侵略滿洲的尸諫，和最近南京玄武湖阮則文自殺之對我政府當局的尸諫，以及去年十二月事件之所謂兵諫…等等。可是這些多是有關國家大事的諫言，和一般人之在私生活或行為上的進諫，是全然不同的。比方子之諫父，卽其一例</p>
<p>據最近的報載：有一鹽城趙老二者，妻已多年，遺有一子三女，子名寶善，現年二十二歲，頗誠實。詎老一年逾半白，常在外尋花拈草，寶善屢諫不聽，近復與同鄕老媽胡氏姘識搬回家中，儼似一對老夫婦，而胡氏前夫所生子女（俗名油瓶）亦隨母來家。從此異母兄弟姊妹，時常發生爭執，而胡氏反唆使將寶善兄妹毒打，前日上午寶善不堪虐待一痛苦，怨憤之餘，舉起菜刀砍去左手食指兩節，藉以諫父，並將鮮血在白紙上寫成“斷指紀念”四個血字：後經鄰居將寶善車送海格路紅十字會醫治，因傷無大碍包紥後，旋卽出院云。”這里說的雖然只是家庭瑣事，然而在這一“諫”之下，卻已經現出了一幕斷指的悲劇。斷指的結果，雖則一流血不多，傷無大碍”，但是有意無意之間，倒在說明了這個社會的悲劇的存在。</p>
<p>父親尋花問柳，妻亡後又結絃這種現象固然極普遍，但是正唯其普遍，所以更其客易形成這一類悲劇的緣因。不久之前，曾有過一幕因父親續絃，而弄成子女大鬧禮堂的悲喜劇，這末一來，更可想見這斷指諫父的悲哀，並不是一件偶然的事件了。</p>
<p>諫而至於流血，或自殺，無論為國為家，都不免有點近乎愚蠢，但是要消滅這種愚蠢的舉動，卻又非體承其忠誠之意旨，而接受了這種諫言不可。</p>

<h3>Methods for Reorganizing the Ningxiang Railway Advance</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The 6.1 million yuan in advances from the British company in the Ningxiang Railway has been resolved through reorganization by the Ministry of Railways and approved by the Central Government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also consulted the British Embassy for record. The reorganization methods are as follows: 1. Among the Ningxiang advances, 1 million taels of treasury silver used to acquire the Zhuping Railway will be reorganized into 1.5 million yuan in national currency, which will be repaid in installments from the profits of the Zhuping section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The repayment will be 100,000 yuan per year for the first five years, 150,000 yuan per year for the next five years, and 200,000 yuan per year thereafter until the entire amount is repaid. The above amount payable each year will be divided into four seasons and paid to the British company. The first payment of 25,000 yuan is scheduled to be paid on July 1, 1937. If the profits of the Zhuping section are insufficient to repay the above amount, the Ministry of Railways guarantees the payment. 2. The remaining part of the Ningxiang advances, totaling 1 million taels of treasury silver, plus 486,000 taels of Shanghai Tael, will be reorganized into 3.6 million yuan in national currency. Since the Ministry of Railways is currently planning to ask the British company to contract for the construction of the Jinggang Railway, or the extension line of the Guangzhou-Meizhou Railway, which is currently under discussion, the amount will be deducted from the net amount of the loan and repaid. However, since the issuance of the above loan has not been decided, the Ministry of Railways will pay interest at the rate of one cent per annum on the principal of the advance, which is 2.2 million yuan in national currency, and pay it every six months. The first payment will be made six months after the signing. The above methods should be considered as the complete method for reorganizing the Ningxiang advances, and the Ningxiang Railway loan contract should be considered void. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo Correspondence</p>
<h3>An Analysis of the Results of the Japanese General Election (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Nan Yun</p>
<p>If a country truly has fair elections, then examining the results of that country's general election is equivalent to understanding the relationships between the various social forces within that country. However, since the advent of parliamentarianism, not only in Japan but in any capitalist country, elections cannot be truly fair. Nevertheless, as social contradictions become increasingly acute and impossible to conceal, the results of a general election can reveal the general state of the rise and fall of domestic forces.</p>
<p>Let us analyze the general situation of social contradictions in Japan today based on the recent general election in Japan.</p>
<p>Under the so-called "quasi-wartime national mobilization" policy, a group of metallic capital oligarchs (such as current Minister of Finance Yuki and current Bank of Japan Governor Ikeda Shigeaki) and the military are clearly in leading positions. Prime Minister Hayashi is merely a liaison between a section of financial capitalists and the military. The tasks given to Hayashi by the military are nothing more than: drafting an unprecedentedly large budget, organizing a government that can implement intensified control, and liberating the parliament that clashes with the military—no, not only Hayashi's cabinet, but future cabinets will not be able to escape these constraints.</p>
<p>The tasks given to Hayashi's cabinet by the military also represent the ambitions of a section of financial capitalists. Because at the current stage of Japanese capitalism, it cannot achieve any prosperity except through the boom in military demand industries, and it cannot achieve monopoly development except through intensified control. Current Minister of Finance Yuki Toyotaro is the former head of the Industrial Bank of Japan, and the current Bank of Japan governor is the so-called "Mitsui strategist," and also Ikeda Shigeaki, who is closely related to the fascist movement—from this relationship, the relationship between a section of financial capitalists, the military, and Hayashi's cabinet is very clear.</p>
<p>The unprecedented military mega-budget was passed, the parliament was dissolved as requested by the military, and the "Planning Board," which could implement intensified control, was mostly established. However, the results of the general election after the dissolution are not only unfavorable to Hayashi's cabinet. Moreover, the anti-government faction in the new parliament still holds a majority. If Hayashi's cabinet does not resign en masse, it will have to dissolve the parliament again. However, even if it dissolves the parliament again, the result will definitely not be favorable to Hayashi's cabinet. Simply because Hayashi's cabinet cannot suppress the soaring prices caused by Hayashi's cabinet's policies, this is enough to destroy the life of Hayashi's cabinet, not to mention anything else.</p>
<p>The difficulties and blows encountered by Hayashi's cabinet are in fact also encountered by one faction of Japan's financial oligarchy and military fascists. However, the fall of Hayashi's cabinet cannot demonstrate the decline of financial oligarchs, nor can it prove the ebb of Japanese fascists. This is very clear.</p>
<p>However, since the "February 26th Incident," "legalist" fascists have always occupied the dominant position. The results of this general election cannot but be said that the advance of fascism has shown a temporary weakening. As for financial capitalists, at most it can only be said that the system represented by Ikeda and Yuki has encountered a very slight setback. Because under the existing system, anyone who forms a cabinet cannot but act according to the wishes of the capitalists. Hayashi's cabinet can fall, Yuki and others can step down, but agents of financial capitalists can be found at any time at present. Even the policy towards China, which represents the interests of Japanese capitalists, will not have the slightest fundamental change.</p>
<p>After dissolving the parliament, General Hayashi originally hoped that a new party would emerge, but because Prince Konoe, the speaker of the House of Peers, was unwilling to come forward to form a new party, the atmosphere of the new party subsided. There are many reasons why the new party could not be established, but the most important and decisive reason is due to the change in the international situation. That is, the completion of China's unification, the cessation of the war, and the atmosphere of national unity against foreign enemies are rising, making Hayashi's cabinet's policy towards China unable to make much progress. Therefore, the illusions of the Japanese people were shattered, they felt the heavy pressure of life even more, and they aroused even greater resentment towards the government. Under such conditions, the fascist movement cannot but suffer setbacks. Originally, striving for colonies is an important condition for the development of fascism at present.</p>
<p>The temporary decline of fascism can also be explained by the setback of Hayashi's cabinet:</p>
<p>As a result of the general election, Hayashi's cabinet's partner, the Showa Society, decreased from the original twenty-four seats to nineteen. The Kokumin Domei (National League) also only maintained its original state (eleven seats). Other associations with fascist characteristics: Political Renovation Council five seats, Yangzheng Association one seat, Kyoguntoshi Association (Rural Soldiers Comrades Association) one seat, Kodo Society one seat, Minrin Society one seat, Toho Association eleven seats, Dai Nippon Youth Party one seat. In addition, there are one or twenty-five neutral seats, which means that the total number of seats for each faction is only about 20% of the current 466 seats. Moreover, not all of the above small associations necessarily express support for the cabinet. For example, Nakano Seigo, the leader of the Toho Association, has long expressed his opposition to Hayashi's cabinet.</p>

The Minseito decreased by twenty-six seats (179), but is still the largest party.</p>

<h3>The Prospects of the British Imperial Conference</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>After the coronation of the British King, which caused a sensation around the world, the world's attention is focused on the British Imperial Conference that opens today. What is the central issue of this conference? It is still impossible to know for sure. The information revealed by the British government is also different. On March 9, British Foreign Secretary Eden claimed that the most important issue in this Imperial Conference was foreign policy. Last month, British Prime Minister Baldwin announced that this Imperial Conference would discuss ① foreign policy issues ② defense issues ③ constitutional issues ④ commercial shipping and air traffic issues. However, the South African representative attending the Imperial Conference recently stated bluntly that this conference is just an economic conference, the legacy of the Ottawa Conference. In our opinion, foreign affairs and economy are about the same importance at this conference. Now, let's examine these two major issues.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the United States' foreign policy. The current world situation is obviously very different from that of 1931. In the past, although British foreign policy wavered between collective security and isolationism, as long as the prestige of the League of Nations existed, Britain's security was relatively guaranteed. This is a point that British diplomats have always recognized. The empire's dominions have always attached great importance to the League of Nations as an institution. Since 1931, the aggressor countries have torn the covenant to pieces. Whether in Europe or in East Asia, Britain is threatened by aggression. What should it do with its foreign policy? This has of course become a problem. In Europe, for its own safety, Britain cannot but liaise with France and Belgium to ensure the security of these countries and prevent German invasion. Such a policy may not be acceptable to dominions such as Canada. There is a need for joint consultation at this Imperial Conference. In the Far East, Britain's current foreign policy is still wavering. Should it cooperate with the United States to deal with Japan together? Or compromise with Japan to preserve the original power in the Pacific? These issues also need to be consulted with the dominions concerned in the Pacific. Because Britain's dominions not only have great independence in internal affairs, but also have individual policies in foreign affairs. For example, the Dominion of Canada has its own individual views on Japan. In 1909, Canada concluded the Gentlemen's Agreement with Japan due to the emigration issue. After the Washington Conference, the sudden cancellation of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was also greatly opposed by Canada. Therefore, to know whether Britain and Japan will be able to find a compromise in the Far East in the future, the attitude of the British Imperial dominions is very noteworthy. This is closely related to China's vital interests. This is also what we are most concerned about in this British Imperial Conference.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about the economic issues in the British Imperial Conference. The development of this issue is closely related to future world economic cooperation. Since the Ottawa Agreement was concluded in 1932, Britain has shifted from free trade to a protectionist tariff policy, creating a trend of economic blocs and making tariff barriers between countries higher and higher. Therefore, the success or failure of the world economic cooperation movement is the main key to this Imperial Conference. If this conference does not agree on a way to change course in the economic policy of the empire, then the actions of European countries to promote Prime Minister Theunis's efforts to reduce trade barriers and restore economic prosperity will inevitably be in vain. We know that Britain has always been fundamentally unwilling to abolish the agricultural import quota system. Moreover, to seek economic cooperation, tariffs must first be generally reduced and most-favored-nation clauses must be abolished. However, regarding this issue, Baldwin also said that the British government pays special attention to maintaining the most-favored-nation clause. Judging from this, the spirit of the Ottawa Agreement will probably still be maintained in this Imperial Conference. If this is true, then the so-called world economic cooperation will probably end up like the 1932 World Monetary Conference, with Britain and the United States falling out.</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Kong Discusses Borrowing from Britain to Develop Industry and Reorganize Old Debts</h3>
<p>Date of Meeting with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Undecided; Will Also Visit Berlin</p>
<p>[London] Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy sent by China to Britain to attend the coronation of the British King, frankly discussed rumors that he intended to negotiate borrowing money during his visit to Britain when he met with a Reuters reporter today. Kong first denied that any proposals had been made or negotiations had begun on the matter, and then said, "It is of course normal for my subordinates to make informal visits and collect information abroad. For example, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's chief economic advisor, also visited me, but before May 15, I am a guest of the British King, and I am currently in the position of a guest, so it is naturally inconvenient to first discuss matters other than formal tasks." Kong further told reporters that British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain had expressed his willingness to have dinner with him in the future, but the date has not yet been selected. Kong said that the interest rate on domestic public bonds in China is between 6% and 9%, and customs duties of about 200 million yuan are paid annually to repay these bonds. Therefore, if he can repay these loans with cheaper currency and use the remainder for construction or to revitalize industry, he will be happy to do so. However, there is no definite plan on how to handle this matter. Kong further said that China has approximately US$120 million in foreign exchange reserves for banknotes in New York and approximately £25 million in London. Therefore, the Chinese people can rest assured about the soundness of the banknotes. Furthermore, judging from the current situation, customs revenue reaches approximately 450 million yuan per year. Kong concluded that the Chinese budget is not unbalanced because national revenue can cover all recurring expenditures. (Reuters dispatch via Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy of China attending the coronation of the British King, has been invited by Hermann Göring, the economic dictator of Germany's Four-Year Plan, Field Marshal Blomberg, Minister of National Defense, and Hjalmar Schacht, Minister of Economic Affairs and President of the German Central Bank, to visit Berlin after completing his official duties, and then go to Baden-Baden for several months of recuperation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[London] Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy of China attending the coronation of the British King, gave a speech to Reuters reporters today, saying, "I cannot describe in words the feelings I have gained from this coronation ceremony of the British monarch. The entire ceremony is filled with religious significance, which is not only a performance on the ceremony, but also has the profound meaning of appealing to God to bless the new dynasty. Secondly, it is incredible that the people of countless countries in the world are expressing joy and praise in different languages at the same time." Kong further stated that one of the most moving sections of the coronation ceremony was when the Archbishop of Canterbury announced the confirmation of the new monarch to the four directions of southeast, northwest, and the new king bowed to the four directions in thanks. Kong and Deputy Envoy Chen Shaokuan left Buckingham Palace at 8:40 AM and arrived at Westminster Abbey. Kong's seat in the church was excellent, close to the high altar. Ambassador Guo Qinqi sat opposite Kong as the Chinese ambassador. A total of ten people participated in the Chinese delegation. (Reuters dispatch via Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japan-Soviet Talks Yield No Results</h3>
<p>Soviet Ambassador Leaves Office</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Naotake met with Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev at the Foreign Minister's residence today to exchange views. It is reported that although the two had a long meeting, their opinions were still far apart. It is rumored that Sato inquired Yurenev's opinion on the possibility of concluding a permanent fishing agreement after the expiration of the existing temporary fishing agreement at the end of this year. Not only did Yurenev not express a definite opinion, but he also inquired Sato's opinion on the Soviet-Manchurian border issue, and no conclusion was reached. However, the two seemed to express the hope that after the arrival of the new Soviet Ambassador, Kosrovsky, the relations between the two countries could be concretely resolved. Yurenev is scheduled to leave Tokyo for Moscow at 7:00 AM on the 15th of this month, and then go to Berlin to take up his new post. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Bond Market Sluggish</h3>
<p>Financial World Uneasy</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The market prices of Japanese government bonds have recently fallen during periods of high short-term interest rates at the end of each month, and the general public has come to regard this as a common phenomenon in finance and does not find it strange. However, this month is still halfway through, and the market price of 3.5% national debt has not risen and is still below the issue price, so the financial and securities circles are deeply worried, thinking that if this continues, it will have a bad impact on the national debt policy, and they hope that the authorities will establish a firm countermeasure as soon as possible. It is also believed that the reason for this phenomenon is not that the credit of the national debt itself has been shaken, but because of the use of funds, so it can be maintained without difficulty as long as an appropriate countermeasure is established.

<h3>British King's Radio Address Thanks Subjects for Love and Support</h3>
<p>The Meaning of the Coronation Ceremony Keeps Pace with the Times; I Wish to Dedicate Myself to Fulfilling the Duties of a Monarch</p>
<p>[London] After the coronation broadcast program concluded tonight, the British King issued an instruction to the people of the entire British Empire from Buckingham Palace. He said, "Tonight, I speak to you with a full heart. Never before has a new king been able to speak to all his people in his palace on the day of his coronation, and never before has the coronation ceremony been as meaningful as it is today. Overseas and domestic territories are now parts of this ancient nation with freedom and equality. Therefore, this morning I felt that the entire British Empire was actually gathered inside Westminster Abbey. I am pleased that, no matter where you are, I can now address you and pay tribute to old friends in distant lands I have visited and new friends in places I have never been. The Queen and I wish you health and happiness. During this time of celebration, we have not forgotten the hardships of the people. The courageous spirit and model citizenship displayed by those encountering hardships will always be remembered by us. We especially wish to express our sympathy and offer comfort to them. I am extremely grateful for your loyalty and love for me and the Queen, which cannot be expressed in words. The kindness you have shown in the streets today and the countless congratulatory telegrams sent from home and abroad have made us feel indescribable. What I can say is that I can now express my gratitude in serving the public, which is the only path I should choose. The crown is a symbol of the unity of hundreds of millions of people. Now, by the grace of God and the will of the free people of the British Empire, I have received this crown. The responsibility for maintaining the honor and integrity of this crown now rests upon me as your monarch. This is indeed a great responsibility, but when I saw your representatives standing around me in Westminster Abbey and knew that you were all participating in this solemn and magnificent ceremony, my heart was filled with trust. The form of the ceremony is passed down from ancient times, but its meaning keeps pace with the times. Its highest meaning is to serve people. I have dedicated myself in extremely solemn words to fulfill the duties of a king. We wish to faithfully fulfill what you have entrusted to us with God's help. I hope that those of you who are children now will forever retain the memory of this pleasant day, just as I still remember the coronation day of the late king. In the future, when you travel from one part of the British Empire to another, it will be like traveling in a large family, and those you meet will have been influenced by the same memories, and their emotions will tend to support our common inheritance. I hope that you all know our free union and our important relationships, and that you know how our friendship with countries around the world can promote peace and progress. The Queen and I will never forget the feelings of this day in our hearts. As I begin my reign, I am deeply moved by the kindness I have received from you. I will never fail to live up to this kindness. I sincerely thank you and pray that God will bless you forever." The aforementioned instruction was issued by the British King alone, sitting in a small room in Buckingham Palace, addressing the broadcasting machine. The Queen and other members of the royal family listened quietly to the broadcast in another room a little further away. The sound was very clear. (12th Central News Agency Reuters Telegraph)</p>

Its inherent stability has been tested by the most severe tests and has not been damaged. Our group of countries is the largest peaceful entity ever. If we do not obtain the goodwill and assistance of those outside this circle, our position will be far less stable than it is today, and it will even be in danger. What is possible for a quarter of humanity is certainly not impossible for the other three-quarters. Today, the largest peaceful organizations in the world are Britain and the United States. It is hoped that President Roosevelt's grand plan to benefit world peace will be realized one day, which would be a blessing for humanity. Humanity has never had such a great opportunity as we have today to help promote the greatest principles of humanity. Among the countries in the world today, the United States is in the most advantageous position. I secretly wish that this great opportunity will not pass silently and be left unutilized.

<p>⊙Ottawa The entire Canada, from the northernmost to the remote defenses, to the bustling cities, celebrated the coronation ceremony of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Tonight, from the east coast to the west coast, signal stations were set up every fifty miles to relay the coronation news with torches. Major cities held celebrations or prayer ceremonies to pray for the new king's blessing. Governor-General Lord Tweedsmuir reviewed the specially selected elite troops in Ottawa, and a large military band played national music. Ten thousand oak trees were shipped from the New Forest in England and planted in various parts of Canada as a memorial to the new king's coronation. (12th Central News Agency Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>London Grand Ceremony Has Passed, Countless People Tiredly Return Home</h3>
<p>More Than 9,000 People Encounter Accidents; 200,000 People Leave London by Train</p>
<p>[London] The grand coronation ceremony has become a past achievement. George VI and Queen Elizabeth woke up late today. The city of London has returned to normal. Yesterday, a total of 9,585 people were injured here. (13th Kuomintang Telegraph)</p>
<p>[London] The splendid coronation ceremony in the royal palace has been completed. Although the weather was unfavorable, with heavy rain driving people away at times, the tourists' enthusiasm was still unabated. In the evening, many gathered in Hyde Park to participate in the celebration. The King and Queen appeared four times in front of the Buckingham Palace hall to thank the crowd. Afterwards, the crowd was still excited, traveling back and forth on the streets, singing old wartime songs. Crowds of people gathered at London stations, waiting for trains to return home. Although they were very happy, many showed signs of fatigue because they had not slept for forty-eight hours. Trains departed from Paddington Station every ten minutes. It is estimated that 200,000 people will leave London by train tonight. No serious misfortunes were reported among the spectators. The occasional incidents were nothing more than minor injuries from falls and fainting due to fatigue. (12th Central News Agency Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>[London] After the coronation parade dispersed, the general public was no longer controlled by the police and rushed to tearooms and cafes in the West End. At that time, there were no vehicles on the streets, only a sea of people moving like a tide. Near Trafalgar Square, the entrances of the underground stations were filled with people waiting for half a kilometer. The streets where the parade passed were littered with paper, newspapers, glass bottles, and orange peels. When the cinemas reopened at 5 PM, they were instantly full, as it was raining heavily on the streets at that time, so people went to the cinemas to avoid the rain. In the evening, when the rain stopped, the streets of the West End were crowded with people, mostly walking around without a specific purpose. The people in the poor areas near the suburbs were no less excited than those in the city. In total, about two million people attended the coronation parade today, not including those who watched the parade from the windows of buildings. The audience was able to maintain strict discipline, and the police maintained order very effectively, so no disturbances occurred. As for those who felt unwell or encountered accidents in the crowd, there were 9,593 people, of which 162 were more serious and were sent to hospitals for treatment. Only in St. James Square, an old man was suffocated to death by the crowd. It is reported that the police used cars equipped with loudspeakers to direct pedestrians today. If there were unexpected situations among the families of the audience, or if the audience felt unwell and were rescued by medical teams, the information was reported through the loudspeakers. There was a car of this kind on Trafalgar Square, saying loudly, "Mr. Wilshire, please go to the vicinity of the big clock on Charing Cross Street to wait for Mrs. Wilshire." When the general audience heard this, they laughed loudly. (12th Central News Agency Havas Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Complex European Situation: England and Germany Approach, England and Italy Become Estranged</h3>
<p>Will Mussolini Visit Hitler?　England Will Pay More Attention to Central European Issues</p>
<p>[Berlin] The new British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, has already presented his credentials. The "Deutsche Diplomatisch-Politische Korrespondenz" (German Diplomatic-Political Correspondence) has published an article reviewing Anglo-German relations. The newspaper declared that the appointment of the new ambassador is particularly gratifying because "in recent months, Anglo-German relations have been very bleak." It also stated that recent articles in British newspapers often give the impression that Britain's attitude towards Germany, if not hostile, is at least unfriendly. Furthermore, the British authorities have failed to take action against defamatory reports. This anti-German propaganda has already had an impact, with political circles in Central European countries believing that Britain will assist anti-German conspiracies and reject German cooperation on European political proposals. This development is inconsistent with the spirit of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, which aimed to establish relations between the two countries on a basis of mutual trust. The newspaper believes that the new ambassador's declaration has clarified Anglo-German relations, stating that the principle of "self-existence and co-existence" will be the foundation of Anglo-German relations. "The British Ambassador declared that there is no problem that cannot be resolved through Anglo-German cooperation. This statement is indeed true." (National Maritime Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>[London] The new British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, paid a visit to Chancellor Hitler the day before yesterday, presented his credentials, and exchanged cordial remarks. The importance of the meeting can be gleaned from the headlines in the London newspapers. The Conservative "Daily Telegraph" headline read "Hitler on Anglo-German Friendship." The "Daily Mail" headline was "Britain Seeks Agreement with Germany." The "Daily Telegraph" declared that the meeting between Ambassador Henderson and the German leader gave German officials a very good impression and was seen as an auspicious sign for the future of Anglo-German relations. The Labour "Daily Herald" also reported that the discussions between Hitler and Henderson were a tangible indication of Anglo-German cooperation. (National Maritime Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>[London] German Defense Minister General von Blomberg, as Germany's representative at the coronation of the British King, visited British Foreign Secretary Eden and Prime Minister Baldwin this morning for lengthy talks. (National Maritime Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The number of British residents here has decreased from 1,300 to 700 since Britain imposed sanctions on Italy. Today, British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Eric Drummond, invited them to the embassy to participate in a coronation celebration, and the ambassador presented them with coronation commemorative spoons. Newspapers are under orders from the authorities not to publish news of the British King's coronation. The only coronation-related news reported was that one person had been crushed to death in London. However, the Vatican's "L'Osservatore Romano" disregarded the Italian authorities' ban and was filled with coronation news. Hundreds of Romans bought and read this newspaper. (Central News Agency, Rome, Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the coronation of the British King, the semi-official Stefani News Agency issued a brief report stating only that the coronation ceremony of King George VI of Great Britain was held this morning, consisting of just a few dozen words. The national newspapers did not mention the coronation celebrations at all, and only referred to Britain in articles commenting on the tense relations between Britain and Italy. The "Popolo di Roma" (People of Rome) stated that the current tension between Britain and Italy should be understood in terms of geography and history. Geographically, Italy's position is not on the main route of the British Empire, making it difficult for Britain to rest easy. Historically, the Abyssinian affair was the most serious setback Britain has suffered since the American War of Independence. Since we cannot change history or geography, we cannot help it.

<p>[Rome] According to reliable sources here today, the Italian government is about to expel Miss Mackenzie, a reporter for the "London Evening Standard," because she sent inaccurate telegrams. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Italian authorities have dismissed as inaccurate reports published by the Vienna correspondent of the French News Agency that Hitler and Mussolini will meet in Venice or at Hitler's villa in Berchtesgaden, Germany. They state that there is no decision whatsoever for the German leader and the Italian Prime Minister to meet. (National Maritime Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin: General Göring, Hitler's confidant and Minister of Aviation, is scheduled to go to Italy on the 15th of this month to spend the Pentecost holiday. German officials have stated that General Göring's trip is purely private and does not involve any mission. As for Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's return visit to Germany, Hitler's villa in Berchtesgaden has been chosen as the meeting place. It is likely that Prime Minister Mussolini will travel on the newly opened air route between the two countries, which allows for direct travel from Rome to that location. (Central News Agency, Rome, Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] German Defense Minister General von Blomberg will visit Rome at the end of May. After visiting Italy, he will visit the Hungarian capital on May 28 to reciprocate the visit of Hungarian Defense Minister General Röder. (National Maritime Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>[London] After the completion of the British King's coronation ceremony, the newspapers here immediately began discussing the political talks that the British government has been holding with visiting statesmen from various countries in recent days, and speculating on the main topics of these talks. The most widely discussed topic is the so-called cooperation of the Danube River countries. It is reported that Czechoslovak Prime Minister Hodza is preparing to obtain British support for his plan to create a Danube River economic group, and at the same time request that Britain abolish the most-favored-nation clause. Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt is also using the same purpose as a negotiating principle. It is widely expected that Britain is very concerned about the problems of Southeastern Europe in the future. (National Maritime Telegraph, 13th)</p>

We would be especially honored if Your Majesty and the Queen could visit Northern Ireland on July 28th of this year." (Central News Agency, London, Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Duke of Windsor Listens to British King's Coronation Ceremony via Radio</h3>
<p>⊙Menges: The Duke of Windsor and Mrs. Wallis Simpson sat side by side in the kitchen of their Cannes villa today, quietly listening to the radio broadcast of the British King's coronation. The kitchen has been transformed into an American-style bar. The Duke, wearing a bathrobe, looked very comfortable. It is reported that the Duke sent a telegram of congratulations to George VI, but the text of the telegram is unknown. The Duke's attitude was very cheerful and he showed no resentment at his brother's coronation. Mrs. Simpson also enjoyed listening to the broadcast very much. It is also said that a specially filmed movie will be rushed here by airplane from London for screening. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>⊙Tours, France: Many journalists went to the nearby Candé villa today, intending to find out what was happening at the villa on the day of King George VI's coronation. However, the Duke of Windsor's spokesman, an American named Rogers, refused to make a statement, saying only that the rumors that a coronation movie would be flown to the villa for the Duke to watch tonight were not true.

<h3>Japanese Fishing Boats Invade Ganyu Waters to Fish</h3>
<p>Smashing Chinese Fishing Nets　Fishermen Suffer Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Haizhou Correspondence: Ganyu County borders the East Sea. Many coastal residents make a living by fishing. Now is the fishing season, and the sea is full of fishermen's sails. However, on the 5th of this month, several gasoline-powered Japanese fishing boats from Qingdao sailed to the waters outside Mujiatuo in the Sixth District of Ganyu, fishing indiscriminately and deliberately smashing Chinese wooden fishing boats and fishing nets. The fishermen were unable to resist and rushed ashore to escape, suffering heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Commanders of Various Divisions of the Fourth Army Request Higher Guangdong Currency Value</h3>
<p>Low Currency Value Leads to High Prices for Food and Goods　Public Food Supply Becomes an Important Issue Recently</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has remained a province with an import surplus in recent years, with money constantly flowing out. Although foreign trade has increased slightly in recent months, major products such as raw silk, tea, mats, silk fabrics, and ivory utensils have not improved significantly. Furthermore, remittances from overseas Chinese are far less than before. There is almost no hope of reversing the outflow of money. As a result of the import surplus, the social economy is depleted and the exchange rate rises accordingly. The ratio of Guangdong currency to national currency has remained at five jiao (0.5 yuan) recently. Due to the above reasons, the prices of all goods, except those produced in Guangdong, have soared. Taking the most needed food, grain, as an example, white rice that costs one yuan in other provinces is more than five jiao more expensive after being transported to Guangdong. Other things can be imagined. Therefore, although rice from neighboring provinces is continuously transported to Guangdong, the price of rice in Guangdong has not fallen slightly recently, precisely because the exchange rate is too high. Merchants therefore plan to reiterate the request to the central authorities to consider the situation, re-increase the value of Guangdong currency, and not devalue it too much, so as to avoid the people of Guangdong suffering from long-term hardship in life. The Guangdong Chamber of Commerce has recently scheduled a meeting to discuss this matter. Yesterday, the generals of the Fourth Army, taking advantage of the visit of Deputy President of the Judicial Yuan Tan Zhen to Guangdong, also went to see him together, requesting him to convey the situation to the central government and find ways to improve the ratio of national currency to Guangdong currency. They spoke with great pain, saying that since the restoration of Guangdong, the central government has been determined to relieve the people of Guangdong from their suffering, such as abolishing exorbitant taxes, and banning opium and gambling. The people of Guangdong are praising and longing to enjoy peace and cheap rice. However, due to the high exchange rate, although rice is being imported continuously, the price of rice has not fallen slightly, and the prices of various goods have also risen, greatly threatening their lives. In the past, one yuan of national currency was only equal to about one yuan and two jiao of Guangdong banknotes. Now, it has increased to one yuan and five jiao, which is tantamount to giving an 80% discount to the value of two yuan of Guangdong currency, which is equivalent to giving an 80% discount to all the wealth of the people of Guangdong. Guangdong is a province with an import surplus. If it exchanges with neighboring provinces based on the national currency, one yuan of Guangdong banknotes will be almost equal to zero after being exchanged five times. Furthermore, in terms of military rations, soldiers could fill their stomachs with six yuan a month in the past, but now it has risen to seven or eight yuan, and they still cannot eat their fill. They earnestly hoped that Deputy President Tan would convey the situation. Tan said that the military commanders including Ye Zhao, Li Hanhun, Mo Xide, Zhang Ruigui, Deng Longguang, Chen Zhang, Brigade Commander Luo Zicun and other said that they had agreed to report to the Central Government and wait for handling.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Civil Servant Sentenced for Extortion</p>
<p>Zhu Yinhui, the owner of the Chengzhang Printing House outside the west gate of this county, extorted one hundred yuan from merchant Zhang Jiliang in February on the pretext of a certain opium case. Commissioner Wang learned of the matter and arrested Zhu Yinhui and transferred him to the district command for questioning. Zhu wrote a confession in prison admitting to accepting bribes. He bribed the staff of commissioner's office, Pu Hua. The district command, according to the confession, considered the case a criminal matter and transferred Zhu and Pu to the local court for investigation. The investigation has now been completed. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution on the charge of fraud and obtaining property. The court repeatedly summoned witnesses to hold court hearings. Finally, at 3 p.m. on the 13th, Judge Wang ascended to the criminal court and sentenced Zhu Yinhui and Pu Hua to one year of imprisonment each for fraud and obtaining property.

<p>In order to understand the livelihood situation of the people so as to promote government affairs, the county government decided that after the rice stem borer removal work is completed, the intern police officers and soldiers will be commissioned, starting from May 20, to continue to conduct a survey of the livelihood situation of the people throughout the county. In addition to ordering the police bureau to earnestly abide by this order, and the township and baojia chiefs of each district to do their best to assist, a public announcement was made yesterday to make everyone aware.</p>

<p>Criminal Escapes from Prison</p>
<p>A prisoner named Wu Ronggen, who had been sentenced to two years in prison by the court, escaped from the county prison of this county yesterday. Due to the large number of prisoners held in the county prison, and because of the hot weather, the prison officer in charge led a group of prisoners out to perform duties every day, either to cut grass or to sweep the streets. The prisoner Wu Ronggen took advantage of this opportunity to escape. The prison authorities are currently searching for him.</p>
<p>Fushan Ferry Becomes a Bubble</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department plans to seek a connection between the traffic between Jiangsu Province and Jiangnan, by setting up a ferry from Langshan Port in Nantong to Fukou in this county. It summoned Ling Zhibin, the chief of the construction department of this county, to inquire about the situation in Fukou. Later, because the beach outside Fukou was very far away and it was not easy to build a pier, and even if it could be built, the cost would be too high, it was difficult to achieve. The Yantze River estuary folk ferry will be more suitable in Jiangyin. If Fukou is abandoned, Jiangyin will be another area of interest.</p>
<p>Discovery of Taiping Official Seal</p>
<p>Recently, many relics of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom have been discovered here. The other day, in an ancient temple in the Xintang port area, a section of the wall collapsed, and an official seal from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era was discovered. The seal is wooden and is very old and dilapidated, but the inscription "Father Heaven, Brother Heaven, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Zhaowen County, Rear Camp, Left Camp, Youlu Shuai" (Lieutenant) and the surrounding dragon patterns are exceptionally clear. Someone has already provided funds to purchase it and send it to the Central Museum for safekeeping.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Planning the Construction of a Suburban Highway Network</p>
<p>The road construction project of the Su-Fu Highway is nearing completion. Long-distance buses have been running between Suzhou and Qionglong Mountain. The entire road will be open to traffic soon. In order to facilitate traffic in the western suburbs of this county, such as Dongting East Mountain, Tianping Mountain, Guanyin Mountain, and Hanshan Temple, etc., the Su-Fu Long-Distance Bus Company has decided to extend the route. The first step is to build a section from Mudu through Tianping Mountain, Hanshan Temple to Suzhou Railway Station. The second step is to build from Mudu through Ducun and Jijing to Dongting East Mountain, and to set up another ferry in Dongting East Mountain across about 20 li of the Taihu Lake surface to Guitouzhu of Dongting West Mountain (not the Guitouzhu in Wuxi, that is in the middle of Taihu Lake, and the scenery is excellent with ancient sites all around). The funds for road construction, etc., require more than 100,000 yuan. The company has decided to continue recruiting investors. It has already drafted a plan and submitted it to the Construction Department for approval and is carrying out road construction surveying. At the same time, Jiang Zhongchuan, Wang Shujie, Fan Junbo, and others have initiated the construction of the Su-Dong Highway (Suzhou to Dongting East Mountain), which has the same route as the Su-Fu Company. A meeting of initiators was once convened to nominate persons in charge, and ten yuan of funding was prepared. Each initiator recognized 20,000 yuan. Later, after learning that the Su-Fu Company had been approved by the Construction Department, it will cooperate with the Su-Fu Company. The Dongting East Mountain Shanghai Native Association has expressed its approval for the Dongshan port to have buses, and has also agreed to join the shares to facilitate progress.</p>

<p>Good Silkworms, High Leaf Prices, Panic</p>
<p>The farmers in the four rural areas of this county have been more enthusiastic about raising spring silkworms this year than last year. More than 160,000 sheets of spring silkworm eggs have been sold in the silkworm demonstration area. Recently, the weather has been mild and most of the silkworms are healthy. The native varieties have been eating vigorously and will soon be ready to spin their cocoons. The improved varieties are also about to undergo their major molt. However, the market price of mulberry leaves has suddenly soared to three yuan per dan, which increases the cost of raising silkworms and causes great anxiety among the farmers. The registration for this year's spring cocoon crop is expected to be around the 25th. The number of registered households last year was 2,690, and it is planned to add 310 more this year, for a total of 3,000. The demonstration area has submitted a request to the Construction Department for approval.</p>
<p>Continuing to Hold the City Parade Festival</p>
<p>On the 28th day of the third month of the lunar calendar, the Seven Temples Festival to worship the Eastern Peak shook the whole city. On that day, six temples returned to their palaces that night. Only the Zhenjiang Wang Wang of the South Water Immortal Temple did not return to his palace, but remained in the Wanggong Ancestral Hall in Huishan Songzi for offering. It was learned yesterday that the temple directors of the temple have decided to hold a city parade festival on May 23 (that is, the 14th day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar) to commemorate Wanggong's construction of the city and defense against the invaders in Xishan. The ceremonial guards are more splendid than those of the Six Temples, with 30 wheeled vehicles and 20 horses.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Please Provide Compensation for Farmland Used for Road Construction</p>
<p>The Yaohan Township outside the east gate was required to allocate farmland and give compensation for the development of a highway. The township residents followed the order and submitted the land order to the former township head, Hua Yunqing. However, Hua Yan did not register and submit it. Hundreds of township residents, both men and women, were extremely anxious and went to the district office to petition on the 11th, demanding that compensation be given as soon as possible. After the district chief Han Guozhang's persuasion failed, he and the bao chiefs went to the county government to petition. County Magistrate Yuan agreed to transfer the matter to the district for handling.</p>

<h3>Funing</h3>
<p>Silkworms and Wheat Damaged Due to Climate</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring in this county, the climate has been cold, and with continuous rain, all the spring silkworms and wheat seeds have been affected by the excessive rain and cold weather, which has severely affected growth. According to old farmers, the silkworm cocoons are reduced by half and the wheat is only about 60% of what it should be.</p>

<p>Burying a Filial Son Alive</p>
<p>Wang Yiqing, the son of Wang Zongchang of Wang Village, Juedu Township, in the Third District of Zhenhai, did not engage in proper business and specialized in associating with bandits. He did everything from theft to kidnapping. Although he was once sent to the county for investigation by his clan members, he did not change his evil ways after being released from prison. The villagers could not bear it any longer. Headed by his father, they gathered together to discuss and decided to put him to death to eliminate future troubles. After the clan members signed, they tightly tied Wang Yiqing's body, hands and feet with ropes, put him in a pre-made large burlap bag, wrapped him in huge stones, carried him to the middle of the river, and threw him into the center of the river, killing him.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Spring Silkworms Show Signs of Disease and Death</p>
<p>Due to the successive increases in silk prices last year, the farmers in the four rural areas of this county have widely raised spring silkworms this year. The Xingbang native silkworms in the southeastern township have already undergone their major molt and are being fed leaves. The northwestern townships are all hatching. The early varieties of improved silkworms are in their second molt, while the later ones are in their initial molt and opening their mouths. However, since the hatching of the native silkworms, the climate has been unstable, with alternating cold and warm, and there has been continuous cloudy and rainy weather, so diseased silkworms have been found in various townships. Recently, the weather has cleared up and if the climate can be adjusted, the spring silkworms can still be saved. Mulberry leaves cost between 1.5 and 1.9 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Requests Postponement of Tax Case</p>
<p>The Shaoxing sauce gardens have been identified to owe tens of thousands of jin of salt for sales, which they are obligated to pay with ten thousand yuan in taxes. Because they could not afford it, they petitioned the Ministry of Finance to request that the levy be changed to a supplemental purchase, but the Ministry did not approve it. The Transportation Department sent personnel to Shaoxing to seal up the factories of the Liuhe Xing and Tongxing sauce gardens, which owed the most. The industry immediately convened a meeting on the 11th. They said that with the current financial ability to pay the levy, they would inevitably go bankrupt. Not only would the livelihoods of the thousands of workers be affected, but the food supply for the people would also be affected. They have decided to appeal according to law, and at the same time request the county chamber of commerce to transfer the request to the authorities to temporarily. The chamber of commerce said that if the sauce garden is closed, it will not only be related to the local people's food supply. There is also an impediment to the lives of a number of workers. Appealing according to the law is an act of desperation. That night, they telegraphed the Zhejiang Salt Affairs Administration to request a temporary stay of execution.</p>

<p>— 桮棬</p>
<p>At 9 PM, we arrived at Qujing County. The main street of the county seat was uniformly decorated with national flags and red lanterns at every house. People from all walks of life lined up for a kilometer to welcome us. We were received at the former Qujing garrison headquarters, now the Normal School. In the school, there was a stele from the fourth year of the Taiheng reign of the Jin Dynasty. Investigation revealed that Cuan was originally a small kingdom, and the Cuan surname once existed, but it is now lost. This stele was unearthed during the Qianlong era and erected here. The old city of Qujing is located five li away from here. It was the Han Chinese who invaded here from the south of the Xiangke River. During the late Ming Dynasty, Mu Ying led troops into Yunnan, bringing Nanjing soldiers who were stationed here for a long time. Therefore, the Qujing natives mostly have their ancestral home in Nanjing, especially the middle-aged and elderly women, whose clothing, hairstyles, foot binding, etc., are very similar to those of Nanjing, and their speech also has the muddy sound of the Nanjing dialect. In the “Tianwang Temple” north of the city, there are seven large and small bronze Buddhas, the larger ones being over ten feet tall. The area is only 100 kilometers away from Dongchuan County. The copper in ancient times was all supplied by the copper mines of Dongchuan County, hence such a large amount of copper material. Outside the South Gate, there is the “Dongshan Temple,” built in the third year of Hongwu. When the Ming Dynasty fell, a relative took refuge in the temple as a monk, with the Dharma name “Qing Zhiye.” When lecturing and discussing Dao, the literary style was very popular. Sun Heran, a famous Qujing Confucian scholar, was a friend of the monk Qing. A descendant of the Sun family is now working as a secretary for Mr. Li Yinquan in Xiaowang Mountain. The anecdotes about Dongshan Temple will be inquired from Mr. Li for more details in the future. That evening, Qujing Normal School and primary and secondary school students held a lantern parade. Regiment Commander Chu gave a speech on behalf of the group. All the Qujing youth sang the Party song and shouted “Long live Chairman Chiang.” It can be said that southern Yunnan and the central government have long been completely integrated. The arrival of the inspection tour has further strengthened this close relationship. The meeting ended at midnight, and it was really unfair to keep the young people up so late.</p>
<p>The twenty-fifth day (April 29th), we departed from Qujing, passing through Guanqiao, Malong County, Xiaotugou, and Dajiqiao, along a flat road of 150 kilometers, to reach Kunming. Ten li away from Kunming, personnel from the British and French consulates were already waiting in cars. People from military, political, academic, and business circles stood for about four kilometers from two kilometers outside the city to the guest house inside the city. The people were out in droves. Many military and police officers wore helmets. Middle schools and social military training were fully armed. The mounted police all rode local small, fat horses. Their hand knives were shiny and uniform. The students wore khaki-colored boy scout uniforms. French priests stood in full attire on the buildings along the street, raising their hands to greet us. We arrived at the Yufu Guest House. The guesthouse was originally the mansion of Mr. Yu Siyang, which was sold to the provincial government for one million Yunnan currency. It is now used as a guest house, or it can be called the Lizi Society. The beds and bedding were prepared, and each meal had an exquisite menu. It can be said that it was the height of luxury. When we arrived, the British and French consuls immediately followed to meet the two group leaders, Chu and Wu, and exchanged pleasantries with them. The French consul, Kang Dong, had served as a counselor in the Peiping embassy and could speak fluent Chinese, engaging with everyone. Zhang Banghan, the director of the Construction Department, was still a young man when he attended the National Assembly of the 20th year of the Republic of China and the Fifth Representative Conference. After five years, his hair had turned gray, which shows his hard work and dedication to his hometown. Mr. Si Sui brought many works on this trip, and Mr. Zheng Yue also brought a batch of recent works. It has been agreed to open a book exhibition in this city. Our inspection in Yunnan was divided into three groups. The first group was near Kunming, the second group set off to inspect the Gejiu tin mines, and the third group went to Dali in northern Yunnan for inspection.</p>
<p>The twenty-sixth day (April 30th), people from all walks of life in Kunming held a welcoming meeting at the provincial party headquarters. Chairman Long delivered a speech and thanked General Wu Qiwei for accompanying the group to Yunnan. General Hao Mengling also rushed from the defense area. Mr. Zhang Banghan of the Yunnan Construction Department had attended the National Assembly of the 20th year of the Republic of China and talked with me very happily. His content was the same as "Yunnan Construction Work Report One." In addition, the Yunnan-Guizhou prosecutor, Mr. Ren Kecheng, was originally going to Guizhou, but because colleagues arrived in Kunming, he deliberately delayed his trip for a few days. At noon, we went to Yuantong Temple to visit the calligraphy and painting exhibition, which had many wonderful pieces, and paid tribute to the martyrs' tombs. We also paid our respects at the tomb of Tang Jiyao to commemorate his contributions to the Protectorate Movement. In the main hall of Yuantong Temple, there is a steel Buddha with a hole in its chest, which was broken by someone during the Muslim Rebellion. Initially, it was thought that the Buddha had a golden heart, but after the hole was pierced, there was nothing inside. Later, after Admiral Ma Rulong quelled the rebellion, the statue was moved back to the temple. The Buddha's face behind the hall looks very similar to Mr. Zhang Ziwang, who drives vegetable oil cars. Everyone joked to Zhang, saying that the vegetable oil car experiment was successful, and he could become a Buddha. A temporary market for local products was set up in front of the temple. Jade articles and bronzes were not of high quality. Sanqi, amber, and ivory were also not top-grade. At the same time, the Yunnan press circles welcomed colleagues from the group at Zhengfeng Restaurant. We met Mr. Li Qicheng. Mr. Li had a special fondness for this newspaper, and we had a very pleasant conversation. In the evening, Chairman Long welcomed us at the Sui Office. The office was the former residence of Wu Sangui, located on a high ground in the city, overlooking the entire city. Mr. Long was dressed in casual clothes, a black mandarin jacket and gray shirt, with a transparent jade ring on his finger. His attitude was sincere, and his eyebrows showed a resolute expression. In his speech, he hoped that the central government would give full material and talent assistance to the border provinces, which are as important as the construction of the hinterland. In the past, the development of the Anhui, Jiangxi, and Guizhou highways received economic and technical assistance from the central government, while Yunnan relied on its own province.</p>
<p>The twenty-seventh day (May 1st), we participated in the military parade in the morning. The soldiers were the Yunnan "Guard Army One, One, Two Regiments" (without a brigade commander, directly under the Sui Office). The soldiers were tall and strong, and some were conscripted from various counties. They are now approaching retirement, and their morale and skills are still considerable. At noon, academic groups gave a public banquet. Since our arrival in Yunnan, we have been overwhelmed by invitations from all parties, and our energy has been completely consumed by personnel matters. Sightseeing, investigation, visits, and recording have been difficult to find time for. On the one hand, we have greatly enjoyed the benefits of the mouth, but it is not very consistent with the original purpose of the group. It is appropriate that Minister Shao Zhonghui convey new instructions from the leader.</p>
<p>When our group arrived, it was decided to divide into three groups to visit the "Gejiu Tin Mine" and the "Dali Highway." Later, because the round trip time was too long, it was completely canceled today. Therefore, the entire group did not go to the Yunnan Provincial Government's "Overview of Yunnan" in two books, which are comparable to the "Jiangxi Yearbook," "Hunan Yearbook," and "Guizhou Today." The degree of accuracy cannot be judged without comparing the facts one by one. People on the journey do not have time for this delicate work.</p>
<p>Kunming political officials and gentry are united, so the promotion is very powerful. However, the general people's lives have not yet escaped hardship. The city has a population of 130,000, and the unemployed account for one-third. The repairs and household registration of rural roads are done by both men and women. According to city customs, the doors open at nine o'clock every morning. Due to the arrival of the inspection tour, it has been changed to seven o'clock. The closing time at night was originally nine o'clock, but it has also been extended by one hour to ten o'clock. The city has a prostitution management office run by the police bureau, with an inspection office located in Yunjin Market. It is "named a group," divided into eight rooms, inhabited by dozens of prostitutes. It is said that these are all lower-class, so the so-called upper-class are probably not under management.</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Returns to Leling Native Place</h3>
<p>Stay for More Than Ten Days then Returns to Ping</p>
<p>Jinan telegram: Ji-Cha Political Committee Chairman Song Zheyuan's ancestral home is Yanmiao, south of Leling City, Shandong. The Song family had not returned home to sweep the graves for a long time, so on the 10th, he led more than 90 members of the Special Service Regiment and secretaries, attendants, etc. from Tianjin, took the Jinpu train south to Cangzhou Station, changed to a car and went to Leling. According to the Leling long-distance telephone, Song Zheyuan and his party arrived at Yanmiao, their ancestral home in Leling, from Cangzhou at 2:00 pm on the 11th to sweep the graves. Leling County Chief Li Nianyi and others personally went outside the city to welcome him, and went to Yanmiao to visit Mr. Song. It was decided that on the 10th, he would meet with Leling county gentry and merchants to advocate the compilation of the Leling County Records. Mr. Song has donated 15,000 yuan for repairing Leling County Records. This time, the compilation office will be discussed. It is heard that Song will stay in Leling for more than ten days before returning to Ping (11th).</p>

<h3>Jianghai Customs Newly Built Giant Aircraft Carrier</h3>
<p>Named Fuxing Can Be Launched Next Month The Ship is Equipped with Eight Patrol Boats</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs' giant aircraft carrier Fuxing will be launched next month. The reporter from Datong News Agency has recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Giant Aircraft Carrier Jianghai Customs has an increasing number of registered ships, and the responsibility for maritime maintenance is also increasing. The existing patrol ships are not enough to be dispatched, so it started two years ago to entrust Jiangnan Shipyard to build a giant aircraft carrier, and then the Ruirong Factory of the shipyard will build eight small patrol boats to strengthen the maritime strength,</p>
<p>Launched in June The aircraft carrier is 400 feet long, majestic and unparalleled, and can be equipped with eight sub-ships. The above-mentioned small patrol boats built by Jiangnan Shipyard and Ruirong Factory are prepared to be equipped with the aircraft carrier, and its greatness can be seen. I heard that the aircraft carrier can be launched in mid-June and the eight small patrol boats have been built and are ready for use,</p>
<p>Management of Ships The Customs currently has more than 30 patrol ships, all of which are arranged in stars, so the aircraft carrier has been named Fuxing. It is verified that the Customs currently manages only civilian ships, which has reached more than 14,000, and the maritime patrol duty is very important, so this addition is made to strengthen the strength, and it is also learned that each of the Customs' existing patrol ships can only be equipped with two patrol boats, which is very different from the aircraft carrier,</p>

<h3>Shanghai Tannery Workers Clash with Detectives Yesterday</h3>
<p>Five Injured Workers Sent to Hospital for Treatment; Party and Government Agencies Sent Personnel to Investigate Yesterday</p>
<p>Over two hundred Chinese workers at the Shanghai Tannery on Avenue Petain, West Shanghai, were dissatisfied with the factory's dismissal of old workers and demanded improved treatment conditions. After the strike, the Public Concession Bureau specially convened both labor and management for mediation at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, which was ineffective. The Jewish foreman of the factory, Harimus, seeing that the workers' sudden strike had affected the hides that had already been immersed in chemical solutions, and that they would corrode if immersed for too long, temporarily hired twelve Russian workers to work in the factory at 9:00 AM yesterday. When the striking workers learned of this, they believed that the Russian workers were intentionally sabotaging the labor movement, so they gathered over a hundred people and went to stop the work. Unexpectedly, the factory owner, seeing the seriousness of the matter, without regard to the jurisdiction of the police, mistakenly reported to the Jing'an Temple Road police station, which dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives and police vehicles to protect them, resulting in a clash with the workers. Workers Chen Shanyun, Chen Baojin, Dai Bobo, Chen Weifa, Yang Lubin, and others were injured in the eyes and heads by detectives using batons. After receiving the news, the Caojiadu Police Station, considering the location of the jurisdiction, also urgently assigned a police chief to go to suppress the situation and persuaded the workers to disperse. At the same time, the injured people were dispatched by policemen No. 6153 and 1153, and an ambulance was called to send them to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road, and then transferred to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the situation was reported to the headquarters for instructions. Meanwhile, party and government agencies have also sent personnel to investigate the truth in order to deal with it. It is reported that when the workers clashed with the detectives, one Western detective and one Indian detective were slightly injured.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weavers Association to Hold Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>Artificial Silk Selling Well, National Silk Declining; Requesting Ministry of Finance to Revise Tax Rates</p>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weavers Association received a letter from the Suzhou Silk Group (Yun Brocade Guild) of the Shanghai Silk Merchants Association stating that the tariff imbalance, with the import tax on artificial silk and finished products differing by more than two times, has caused chaos in the silk market and made it difficult to promote domestic silk. They requested a meeting to be convened to send representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Finance to change the tax rate on imported artificial silk to ad valorem in order to avoid bias. After receiving the letter, the association, considering that this matter concerns the survival of the entire national silk industry, specifically scheduled representatives from silk weaving industries in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and southern provinces to come to Shanghai on the 18th of this month for an emergency meeting to discuss measures. A notice was issued yesterday stating: "Dear Sirs, (Omitted) According to this, the excessively low and heavy import tariffs on artificial silk and artificial silk fabrics have provided foreign merchants with the opportunity to dump a large number of artificial silk woven finished products in China, resulting in the current state of decline and exhaustion for the domestic silk industry. The association has repeatedly requested the Ministry of Finance to revise these tax regulations to reduce the surplus and supplement the deficiency, but has not been approved. Today, our country's silk industry has suffered deeply and is on the verge of extinction. Only by gathering the full strength of the industry in both provinces and resolutely striving can we save it. Otherwise, if we continue to delay and mislead ourselves, the livelihoods of millions of industrialists and merchants in our two provinces will inevitably fall into failure. Therefore, it is specifically scheduled for the 18th of this month (Tuesday) at 3:00 PM at the association's office on Gaodun Street, Jiumu Di, Shanghai, to hold an emergency meeting of the industry in both provinces to discuss measures and make public decisions for implementation. We urge your (guild) (representative) to arrive in Shanghai on time and attend the meeting to express your great views. We sincerely hope so."</p>

<h3>Relief Committee Cables Disaster Relief Association to Raise Funds for Gansu Disaster</h3>
<p>Remit Funds to Gansu for Monitored Distribution of Relief</p>
<p>The Joint Disaster Relief Association of charitable organizations in this city received a telegram from the Relief Commission yesterday, requesting it to quickly raise relief funds for the Gansu disaster. The original telegram read: "The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association's kind consideration is requested. The Gansu disaster is severe, and the victims are crying out for food and relief. If your association has donations designated for the Gansu disaster, please collect and remit them to this commission as soon as possible so that they can be remitted to Gansu Province for supervised distribution by the Relief Funds Commissioner, Du Yannian. This is most urgent. Printed by the Relief Commission."</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Medicine Shipped to Gansu by Eurasia Aviation</h3>

<h3>Increased Disaster Relief for Dengfeng</h3>
<p>Jisheng Society Remitted Over 60,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society and the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association jointly launched emergency relief for Dengfeng. Yesterday, they received a telegram from Feng Junyangshan, director of relief affairs of the association, which stated, "We have received your letter. The household survey is complete, totaling 18,852 households. Based on the severity of the disaster, calculated by grade, the minimum requirement is 56,000 yuan for cash relief and 5,000 yuan for work relief. Except for the funds received, there is still a shortage of 6,000 yuan. In any case, this amount cannot be reduced. Please make every effort to raise funds for relief." The two associations have already entrusted Zhengjiaotong Bank to remit 55,000 yuan in advance and have now added another 6,000 yuan, all of which has been remitted, totaling 61,000 yuan. The amount of relief for Dengfeng County alone, including both emergency and work relief, totals more than 60,000 yuan, which is a significant amount. However, in areas with severe disasters, where the old harvest has been exhausted and the new harvest is not yet in, this can only temporarily address the immediate needs. The long-term outlook is bleak and unimaginable. It is difficult for the two associations to raise funds, and most of it is borrowed in advance. The disaster victims in the four provinces of Henan, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou are crying out for food. There are countless millions. It is hoped that patriotic people with charitable hearts will alleviate the hunger and distress of others, do their utmost, and practice thrift to rescue the survivors and reverse the disaster.</p>

<h3>Municipal Land Administration Bureau Supplementary Measures for Sealing Land</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association, due to the difficulty for its clients in requesting the court to execute land, has sent a letter to the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government has replied and attached the land survey measures formulated by the Land Administration Bureau, which are recorded below.</p>
<p>Supplementary Measures for Sealing Land Formulated by the Municipal Land Bureau:</p>
<p>(1) When the court executes the sealing of land, it shall, ten days before the sealing, send a letter to the Bureau requesting it to send personnel to conduct a joint survey and determine the boundaries, and then immediately stop the transfer of ownership. Then, the court shall send a letter to the Bureau requesting it to measure and evaluate the land. The letter shall clearly state the addresses of the creditor and debtor.</p>
<p>(2) After receiving the sealing notice from the Bureau, it shall send personnel holding credentials to the court on time to go together. If the date is changed or the sealing is stopped before the due date, the court shall notify the Bureau by telephone within the possible scope.</p>
<p>(3) The car fare for the personnel sent by the Bureau to the court, and the wooden stakes used for marking the boundaries, shall be paid from the Bureau's measurement fee. The car fare from the court and to the court shall be paid by the court from the sealing fee.</p>
<p>(4) When the court regularly seals the land and requests the Bureau to send personnel, in addition to the court notifying the creditor and inviting the local guarantor to receive the seal, the Bureau shall also order the local guarantor to arrive on time.</p>
<p>(5) For real estate registration certificates originally belonging to Baoshan County and submitted to the court, the court shall directly check them and send a letter to the Bureau for valuation, without the need for a joint survey.</p>
<p>(6) After the court sends a letter to the Bureau requesting measurement and valuation, the Bureau shall send the survey drawing and the valuation list to the court within two months at the latest. However, for land certificates within Shanghai County, because it is necessary to check the registration list, the location, and the boundaries of the mu, or because boundary disputes occur with neighboring households, the completion period cannot be determined. However, the Bureau shall handle it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(7) The measurement fee shall still be collected by the Bureau directly from the parties concerned after the sealing, as per usual practice.</p>
<p>(8) Regarding the attachment of land, the Bureau shall still follow the usual practice of issuing a land certificate number or a single number after the sealing and sending a letter to the Bureau to prohibit the debtor from disposing of the land, without first sending a letter requesting a joint survey.</p>
<p>(9) For land that has already been sealed but not surveyed jointly by the Bureau, if the court deems it necessary to conduct a joint survey when sending a letter to the Bureau for measurement, the court may also send a letter to the Bureau ten days in advance to request it to send personnel to go together.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang Hates Ridiculous Geomancy</h3>
<p>Letter to Nephew Instructing Him Not to Believe in Feng Shui</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Chairman Wang of the Central Political Committee has always hated the absurd talk of geomancy. Recently, regarding the relocation of his uncle's burial, he sent a private letter to his nephew, Shen Shansong, instructing him to never believe in feng shui, which can be said to be a blow to the head for feng shui masters. The original letter is extracted below:</p>
<p>Nephew Shen Cigao,</p>
<p>I received the letter from your third aunt, saying that the municipal government will open West Lihu Park, and the tomb of your third uncle must be moved. I asked you to speak for it. I replied immediately, there is nothing to say. If the government moves the burial, please trouble the nephew to take care of it in the province. If you need to return to Beijing, then entrust someone to take care of it. The burial fee of one thousand yuan will be remitted immediately. Absolutely do not listen to a word from the dog-headed feng shui master. The rest is troubled by the nephew to preside over.</p>

<h3>Flourishing Far East Shipping</h3>
<p>Strong Cargo Transportation and Increased Wheat Prices Create a Severe Shortage of Ships and Difficulty in Chartering</p>
<p>Shipping companies from countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands are successively building giant ships to compete for Far East business, forming a white-hot situation. According to news from a foreign shipping company in this city, the prosperity of the Far East shipping market is a rare sight since the European War, resulting in a severe shortage of ships and difficulty in chartering. It will still take a considerable amount of time for Australia to clear its backlog. On the one hand, strong cargo transportation and increased wheat prices require an increase in ships to clear the backlog, which is particularly urgent. However, there are too many renters of time charter ships, and there are no surplus ships. The term of these time charters ranges from about six months to nine months. The ship rental is calculated according to the loaded tonnage, and the price of large ships is as high as eight shillings (about 6.50 national currency). Ships in the Mediterranean that can sail are paying attention to Argentina's banking business and are willing to sail empty to pick up cargo. If this situation continues, the Far East freight rate will have to be revised. It is difficult to make a profit on goods transported from the United States to the East, because most shipowners still think the current charter price is too low. Therefore, freight rates for scrap iron, sugar transported to the West Indies, and other goods have continued to increase. The freight rate for scrap iron transported from the United States to Japan reached 37 shillings and 6 pence in May, and there is still the possibility of further increase. The number of ships needed for time charters in Japan is gradually increasing, and the price is still between six shillings and six pence and eight shillings (about five to six yuan and five jiao), and there is no standard, depending on the size of the ship and the length of the rental period, but its need is still extremely urgent. Recently, there have also been new methods of calculating ship rentals based on each voyage, which is a novel method in the midst of ship panic.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Fellow Association to Hold Inaugural Meeting</h3>
<p>On the 23rd at the District One Water and Electricity Workers' Union</p>
<p>Since the Songjiang Fellow Association in Shanghai was initiated and organized by Wu Kaixian, Zhang Xiaotong, and others, and members have been solicited and preparations have been actively made, it has been for a year. It has now been completed. It is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month at the auditorium of the District One Water and Electricity Workers' Union on Guohuo Road in the Nanshi area. In addition to the dispatch of personnel from Party and government agencies to attend and guide, more than a thousand members of the association will attend the inaugural ceremony.</p>
<h3>Shandong Fellow Association Cables Request to Postpone Salt Tax Increase in Shandong Area</h3>
<p>The Shandong Fellow Association in Shanghai, believing that Shandong has suffered from disasters for years and the people's livelihood has not yet recovered, and that the central government has now stipulated that a special construction fund of one yuan per city should be added under the salt tax item in the Shandong area, was shocked when the Fellow Association heard the news. It specially cabled the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing Government and the Ministry of Finance to postpone the implementation of the salt tax increase in the Shandong area. The text of the telegram is recorded below.</p>
<p>To the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing Government and the Ministry of Finance:</p>
<p>We have recently read in the newspapers that the central government has stipulated that a special construction fund of one yuan per city should be added to the salt tax item in the Shandong area, and that the salt price per jin should be increased by one cent for salt merchants in each county, etc. The Shandong Fellow Association in Shanghai was shocked to hear the news. Shandong has suffered from disasters for years, and the people's livelihood has not yet recovered. The current salt price is already very high. If it is further increased, it will be more difficult for the people of Shandong to survive. Moreover, if the salt tax is increased, local scoundrels will inevitably take the opportunity to smuggle and transport salt. In this way, not only will the annual salt tax not increase, but it will only increase the suffering of the people in vain. The government will bear the false name of increasing the burden on the people, while the people will suffer a great economic loss. If it is said that national construction requires funds urgently, it is possible to find ways to open up funds without passing the burden on to the people. Moreover, the fishermen along the coast of Shandong use salt in large quantities. If the salt tax is increased by one cent, the burden will be very heavy, and their livelihood is deeply concerned. We sincerely hope that the Department will care about the people's suffering and embrace compassion. We earnestly request that you consider the suffering of the people and allow a temporary postponement of the tax increase in the Shandong area. We await your orders with the utmost urgency.</p>
<p>The Shandong Fellow Association in Shanghai bows respectfully.</p>
<h3>Shangyu Fellow Association Suggests Moving Hospital Ticket Sales</h3>
<p>The celebrations held for the coronation of the British Emperor by the Chinese people of this city on the 10th, 11th, and 12th of May were held at the Racecourse. The hall feared that too many people would affect the order, so tickets were sold, divided into three grades of five yuan, three yuan, and two yuan. The amount of revenue is likely to be quite considerable. Chen Jiufeng, a member of the Shangyu Fellow Association, believes that this revenue, taken from the celebration by the citizens, should be used for the welfare of the citizens. He sent a letter to the association to forward it to the Bureau of Works, suggesting its original letter, stating:</p>
<p>"I am writing to inform you that, according to a letter from members Chen Jiufeng and others, the Chinese people are expressing enthusiastic celebrations for the coronation of the British Emperor, which is sufficient evidence of the harmony of Sino-British relations and the love of the people of both countries. It is heard that, on the day of the celebration, the Racecourse restricted the number of celebrants and sold tickets, which is also a very appropriate move. On the one hand, it is a gift of congratulations, and on the other hand, the proceeds from the tickets sold during the celebration period should be used for the expenses of the Racecourse's epidemic hospital, which would be fair and reasonable, and the facts could be achieved in both aspects. Please send a letter to the Bureau of Works to suggest these words. According to this investigation, the sale of tickets for the Racecourse's coronation celebration was originally to limit the chaos. The revenue is used for good deeds, which is a proper way to handle it. We should send a letter to your office for review. If you can accept the suggestion, the Chinese people will be even more grateful for the benevolence of your great emperor. If there are other solutions, we also hope for a reply. This is to convey the brotherhood between us."</p>

<h3>Animal Protection Society Requests Temporary Suspension of Capture and Killing of Stray Dogs</h3>
<p>Letter to Rugao County Government, Adopted by Sun Jun</p>
<p>The China Animal Protection Society yesterday sent a letter to the Rugao County Government, requesting a temporary suspension of the capture and killing of stray dogs in order to maintain animal life. The original letter reads, "According to member Yuan Puci's report, the county of Gui is brutally killing stray dogs, inflicting cruel punishment on living things, and Sun Fasuo and others have initiated fundraising for adoption, requesting that a letter be forwarded to your county government to temporarily suspend the capture and killing in order to maintain animal life. The fact that stray dogs are rampant is detrimental to city guests and hygiene, and measures should be taken to ban them, but this kind of crime does not occur in the animal itself, and if their lives are harmed because of it, it does not seem to be the way of benevolence to love things. Now that Mr. Sun and others have initiated adoption, it seems that they can be allowed to do so, so that animal life and urban sanitation are not hindered. It should be instructed to temporarily suspend the execution in order to maintain the path of benevolence."</p>

<h3>Celebrating the British King's Coronation: Thugs Seize the Opportunity to Cause Trouble</h3>
<p>Multiple Women Abused by Heinous Perpetrators; Police Lawyers Request Full Legal Punishment</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was the official coronation day of the British King. A military parade was held at the Racecourse, causing a large crowd of people who enjoy excitement to gather around the Racecourse, leading to blocked roads. Taking advantage of this situation, thugs and petty thieves were out in force, insulting women and robbing people of their belongings. The First Special District Court received many such cases, numbering seven or eight. Details of some of the cases are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Chen Feifei, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 128 Guizhou Road, twenty years old, was riding in a rickshaw around 9 p.m. planning to go to the Xiaoyao Ballroom on Yuchaqing Road. When the rickshaw reached the intersection of Yuchaqing Road and Jiujiang Road, dozens of thugs, including Li A'gen from Huzhou, rushed forward and overturned the rickshaw. Chen fell to the ground, and Li and the others immediately tore off all of Chen's cheongsam, underwear, and pants, leaving Chen completely naked. Li and the others then committed various illegal acts, injuring Chen's lower body and buttocks. Chen reported this to Chinese detective Zhang Zhiqiu, who arrested Li. Chen's wallet and watch were also missing. ㊁ Shi Wenying, a nineteen-year-old local woman residing at No. 16 Xiamen Road, who used to work as a dancer but recently quit, was leaving the Dadong Ballroom around 11:40 p.m. When she passed the intersection of Yinghua Street and Jiujiang Road, she was suddenly dragged into an alley next to the Great World entertainment center by Yangzhounese Bian Zhenghong and others, who committed indecent acts, injuring Wang's lower body. Passerby Tang A'liu stepped forward and handed Bian over to Chinese detective Chen Shanji, who took him into the Laozha Police Station. ㊂ Shen Lindi, a woman residing at No. 444 Xiangfen Lane, was walking along Nanjing Road near Guangxi Road around 11:35 a.m. when Tong A'gen and others from Ningbo stepped forward and picked Shen up, causing her shoes to fall off and making it impossible for her to walk. Wang then seized the opportunity to snatch Shen's watch. Later, Wang was apprehended by the police. ㊃ Wang Zhenzhen, a woman residing at No. 17 Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, who performs dramas at the Oriental Bookstore, was passing near the International Ballroom on Guizhou Road around 11:15 p.m. when Zhang Yuanqing from Anhui stepped forward and snatched her wallet. After Wang shouted for help, Chinese detective Weng Hongdong came forward and apprehended Zhang. ㊄ Wang Zhu Shi, a pregnant woman residing at No. 4 Ruikang Lane, Beijing Road, who was six months pregnant, was riding in a rickshaw with her husband, Wang Deqing, to her mother's house in Ningbo around 5:10 p.m. when dozens of bandits, including Wang Fengsong from Songjiang, stepped forward at the intersection of Guizhou Road and Nanjing Road. Li overturned Wang's rickshaw, and she fell to the ground. The bandit Wang then straddled her body, attempting to commit an illegal act, while others chimed in, causing injuries to her face and legs. At the same time, her wallet, containing valuables worth over twenty yuan, was snatched by Wang and taken away by his accomplices. Wang Fengsong was grabbed by Wang Deqing and handed over to Chinese detective Min Zhaoxian, who took him into the Laozha Police Station. ㊅ Yuan Gongchang was passing the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yuchaqing Road around 8:35 p.m. when Qian Shuqing from Nanjing stepped forward and snatched the felt hat he was wearing. Qian was caught on the spot by Yuan, but the hat had already been taken away by his accomplices. Qian was also handed over to the police and taken into the Laozha Police Station. All six cases were sent by the police to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed charges under Article 325 and 329 of the Criminal Law for robbery and Article 225 of the Criminal Law for offenses against public morals. He stated that the defendants' behavior was extremely vile, leaving no room for leniency, and requested that they be severely punished according to the law to deter future offenders. After Judge Feng Shide questioned each case, except for the ten A'gen, who was sentenced to one year in prison, the remaining cases were either postponed until next Thursday morning for further hearing or scheduled for judgment next Thursday morning. In the first case, the victim Chen Feifei not only suffered injuries to her lower body but also was unable to return home due to her clothes being completely torn off, leaving her naked. The detectives helped her by borrowing clothes, which she wore before hiring a rickshaw to go home.</p>
<h3>Murderous Assault on Wife Due to Suspected Infidelity</h3>
<p>Wife Survives but is Crippled; Case Under Trial, Investigation Pending</p>
<p>Du Wenli (also known as Du Wu), Du Wenkui (also known as Du Liu), and Du Wenhua (also known as Du Qi) are brothers. Du Liu's wife, Du Li Shi, originally lived in Nanjing. According to Du Liu, because Du Li Shi had an affair with Zhou Baohua, Du Liu moved to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, Zhou followed them to Shanghai and continued the affair. Therefore, Du Liu, his brother Du Wu, his younger brother Du Qi, and Xu Qing'en (Du Qi's brother-in-law) conspired to kill the adulterous woman. On the night of January 19, Xu Qing'en invited Du Liu and Du Li Shi for dinner. When they passed the entrance of Moling Lane on Jinling Road in Zhabei, Xu Qing'en pushed Du Li Shi into the lane. Xu Qing'en and Du Liu then pulled out sharp knives and stabbed her. Du Wu and Du Qi stood guard at the entrance of the lane. They stabbed Du Li Shi more than ten times, believing she was dead, and then fled. Unexpectedly, she was still alive and was sent to the hospital by the police. Although her life was saved, her limbs were broken, leaving her crippled. She claimed that her husband did not engage in honest work and had committed theft multiple times, and she had repeatedly advised him against it, causing resentment. Therefore, her eldest uncle, youngest uncle, and Xu Qing'en conspired to kill her. The local court arrested the three Du brothers and filed a public lawsuit. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongxing opened the trial. Du Liu confessed that his wife had committed adultery with Zhou Baohua and requested that Zhou also be punished for adultery according to the law. As for the murder of Du Li Shi, Du Liu confessed without hesitation but claimed that his brothers were not involved. He also claimed that after killing his wife, he fled to Xiaguan, Nanjing, but he personally wrote a letter to his father-in-law, Li Songshan, informing him that he would be filing a lawsuit and provided his address. Therefore, the detectives were able to apprehend him based on his description. He argued that this was not due to the merits of the detectives but was self-surrender. He requested that the court adopt his statement. The court then summoned Zhou Baohua, who denied having an affair with Du Li Shi. The court instructed Zhou Baohua to post bail and told Du Liu that he should sue Zhou Baohua and Du Li Shi at the Nanjing Capital District Court because it was a matter of jurisdiction. Du Liu thanked the court. The court then asked Du Wu and Du Qi, who both claimed that they were working at the Pudong Water Plant that day and could not have been present, and provided wage records as proof. After reviewing the evidence, the court ruled that Du Wu and Du Qi could post a reliable surety and should be available for questioning at any time. However, Li Songshan, Du Li Shi's father, stated that his daughter had been crippled and requested damages of three thousand yuan. Finally, the court adjourned the case for further investigation and questioning. Du Wenkui (Du Liu) was returned to custody, and Xu Qing'en was placed on the wanted list.</p>
<h3>Vehicle Inspection on the Shanghai-Minhang Road</h3>
<p>Preventing Banditry</p>
<p>Recently, there have been incidents of bandits robbing cars in Shanghai. Therefore, local authorities are stepping up precautions to maintain public safety. The Shanghai-Minhang South Extension Road connects to the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and various branch roads such as the Shanghai-Songjiang road, allowing for smooth traffic. It is inevitable that unscrupulous individuals will take the opportunity to covet it. Luo, the head of the Caojing District, and Yin, the head of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, are jointly taking precautions to prevent incidents from occurring. County police are responsible for inspecting vehicles heading south at the Qianliangmiao Station or the Beiqiao Station. Those coming to Shanghai from Minhang will be strictly inspected by police from the district at the Caohejing Cao Family Garden. In addition, Inspector Zhang Xilong is patrolling and supervising to ensure thoroughness. This measure has been implemented since yesterday to ensure the safety of travelers.</p>

<p>Chen Tifang from Tongzhou runs a thriving hotel in his hometown and has accumulated some savings over the years. His son, Yaoguo, is twenty-two years old and not yet married. At the end of last year, Yaoguo came to Shanghai for leisure and stayed at his uncle Yuan Zhenxin's house. Yuan, who runs a clinic with Doctor Ye at No. 80, Lane 435, Tokyo Road, lives at No. 1345 Robinson Road. Yuan learned that his nephew Yaoguo's father had recently taken a concubine. Yuan instigated Yaoguo, saying that since his father had taken a concubine, his future livelihood and inheritance were at risk. He suggested that Yaoguo try to obtain some cash and save it for his future independence. Yaoguo, being young and inexperienced, believed him. He immediately returned to his hometown and stole over 1,600 yuan from his father. On January 16 of this year, he returned to Shanghai. After taking some expenses for himself, he handed over the remaining 1,520 yuan to Yuan Zhenxin, asking him to deposit it for him. At the same time, fearing that his father would come to Shanghai to look for him, Yuan also encouraged Yaoguo to temporarily avoid him by going to Suzhou to learn medicine with a doctor. After a few days, Yaoguo came to Shanghai to inquire about the news. Unexpectedly, Yuan Zhenxin had the intention of embezzling the money. Apart from acknowledging the expenses of over 600 yuan used for introducing him to the doctor, he denied having kept the remaining money, intending to misappropriate it. After repeated negotiations failed, Chen Yaoguo was angered. On the 8th of this month, he opened Room 13 at the Anle Hotel on North Zhejiang Road alone, wrote two suicide notes to his father, Chen Tifang, detailing the events. He also wrote two letters to the police and the Anle Hotel, planning to commit suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River late at night. However, Chen's actions were seen as suspicious by the tea boy, who reported it to the Huizha Police Station. Detective Zhuge Qian went to investigate and learned the details. He then arrested Yuan Zhenxin. It was not until the day before yesterday that Yuan was arrested on Xinzha Road and taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the above situation and requested that Yuan Zhenxin be detained for further investigation. Following this, Chen Yaoguo filed a complaint detailing the events. When questioned, Yuan Zhenxin absolutely denied that his nephew Chen Yaoguo had deposited 1,520 yuan with him and hired a lawyer to request bail. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the statements and ordered that Yuan not be granted bail and that he be detained until the morning of the 18th for further questioning.</p>

<h3>He Kangli Appeals Original Sentence in Rape Case</h3>
<p>Luo Xi to Marry Liu Binru; He Objects to Luo's Age</p>
<p>He Kangli, a 27-year-old from Huarong, Hunan, was accused of rape by Luo Xi (also known as Wei Xuezhen), a woman from Changsha, a fellow townsperson. He was sentenced to six months in prison with a three-year suspended sentence by the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Luo also filed a civil suit for damages of 20,200 yuan, resulting in a judgment for He to pay 1,000 yuan. He was granted bail and released pending the appeal period. He appealed both the criminal and civil judgments to the Third Branch of the High Court. The criminal part of the case was investigated by Judge Chen Daqi of the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday morning, the criminal panel, consisting of Criminal Division Chief Wu Tingqi and judges Chen Daqi and Wang Yue, along with Prosecutor Dong, convened a joint session in the Third Criminal Court for the trial. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi appeared on behalf of the French police. The plaintiff, Luo Xi, did not attend; only the appellant, He Kangli, and his defense attorney were present. He stated that he was formerly a teacher and currently resides at No. 98 Xie Xu Road. Luo Xi reported to the French police on February 23 of this year, accusing him of rape, which led to his arrest and transfer to the Second Special District Court, where he was sentenced to six months in prison. He stated that he could not accept the sentence. The court ordered him to state the grounds for his appeal. He stated two grounds for appeal: ㊀ Luo Xi had a relationship with him in October of last year, which she initiated. She was over sixteen years old last year. She claimed to be seventeen years old last year, so she must be eighteen years old this year. She was born on March 18, as indicated on the household registration records at the Changsha Police Bureau. When she accused him, she suddenly said she was sixteen years old. He could not accept the original judgment that he had raped a girl under sixteen years old. ㊁ She had a relationship with Liu Binru in the middle of her relationship with him, and later she colluded with Liu to frame him, causing him to be involved in a lawsuit. She and Liu are currently living in the Hunan Elementary School on Jumen Road in the Nanshi district and are about to get married. The court reviewed the statements and ordered that Luo Xi be summoned to court at a later date for further questioning. The court then adjourned.</p>

<h3>Accusation of Embezzlement During Voting Yesterday, Witness Summoned</h3>
<p>Signature on Stock Completely Correct; Verified by Employee of Huitong Company</p>
<p>After the death of Xi Lanqing from Pudong, his concubine Zhou Huilin, Hu Shulin, Chuan Minqi, and Peng Renyin are suspected of embezzlement. The case was reported to the Laozha Police Station by Xi's children and a public lawsuit was filed. The First Special District Court has held several trials on the matter, as detailed in this newspaper. During the postponement, the police seized an iron box belonging to the defendants, which was stored at the Dade Qianzhuang, and presented it to the notary office of the First Special District Court. The box contained only six yuan in national currency. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide of the First Special District Court continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. Police lawyers Ru Baoyi and Wang Yaotang briefly restated the facts of the prosecution. Huang Xingshen, an employee of the Huitong Company, testified that on March 16, the defendants Zhou Huilin, Hu Shulin, and Chuan Minqi came to request that 6,000 shares of Java Company stock and 400 shares of rubber stock be transferred from Xi Lanqing's account to Zhou Huilin's. Xi's signature on the stock was completely correct, and the words "Zhou Huilin" were written by Hu Shulin. Zhou's seal was stamped by Zhou herself. Zhou Huilin stated that the Zilaihuo Company stock and other stocks were given to her by Xi Lanqing during his lifetime. Xi had personally signed the transfer application. The stocks only required the applicant's signature to be transferred, so she and Hu and Chuan came to Shanghai to transfer the stock to the Zilaihuo Company. Because she did not speak English, she entrusted Hu and Chuan to go. After the court questioned the three defendants, Hu, Chuan, and Peng, it announced that the trial would be postponed.</p>
<h3>Theater Tea Boy Indecent Assault Case Indictment</h3>
<p>Yun He Shao, residing at No. 6 Taihe Street, Yangshupu Road, along with theater tea boys, Ningbo natives Chen Awei and Wu Abao (both 19 years old), on the 7th of this month, after the play ended at midnight, seized the opportunity to lure four female spectators from the same village, Wu Damao, 19 years old, her younger sister Xiaomao, 16 years old, Zhou Jinmei, 17 years old, and another woman, Wang Jidi, to the Xi'an Hotel on Xi'an Road. They booked two rooms, with the four women residing in one room, and Chen and Wu in the other. Initially, nothing happened. However, around 4 a.m., Chen Awei and Wu Abao stealthily entered the women's room and dragged Wu Damao and Zhou Jinmei into their room. Chen slept with Damao, and Wu shared a bed with Jinmei, defiling their innocence. At dawn, they dispersed. Wang Xingdi and Xiaomao were fortunately not violated. The next afternoon at 3 p.m., tea boys Chen and Wu encountered Wu Damao and Zhou Jinmei near the theater and went to the Yadong Hotel on Guangdong Road for continued pleasure. The following day, they went to the Xinjiang Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road and booked a room, making it three times in total. The matter was discovered by the two women's family members, Wu Ahu and Zhou Fangshi. The day before yesterday, they reported the situation to the Yulin Road Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detectives Liu Zhisheng and Zhao Baosheng to secretly investigate the address and apprehend tea boys Chen and Wu, who were taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's legal counsel, Gai Tianyin, explained the case and initiated prosecution based on Article 240 and Article 241, Section 3 of the Criminal Law, concerning enticement and indecent assault. He stated that the two defendants denied raping Wu and Zhou in the police station, but Wu Damao and Zhou Jinmei underwent examinations at Renji, Baolong, and Guangren Hospitals. Their certificates of diagnosis have not yet been completed, and a request was made to postpone the case. According to the testimonies of Wu Damao and Zhou Jinmei, they were deceived by the two defendants and acted not out of their own free will. When questioned, the defendants Chen Awei and Wu Abao firmly denied raping the two women. Judge Zhong Qing ordered them to remain in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>

<h3>Lao Yang Qinghe Fuju Closure Unrelated to Yang Qinghe Faji</h3>
<p>Faji Silver Shop Operates as Usual</p>
<p>Yang Qinghe Faji Silver Shop, located at No. 154 Henan Road, has been established for nearly 40 years and is a leading enterprise in Shanghai's silver shop industry. With an outstanding reputation and flourishing business, its operations have become even more prosperous recently after the closure of Lao Yang Qinghe Fuju Silver Shop at No. 393 Henan Road. Yesterday's report stating that the shop had announced its closure was a mistake regarding Lao Yang Qinghe Fuju Silver Shop.

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Stopping the Carriage to File a Complaint</h3>
<p>— Naiyi</p>
<p>The Beijing-Yunnan touring group is now on its way back. Thanks to the news reports, the touring group has told us many valuable things and insights, thus indirectly enabling us to gain more knowledge and understand the situation in various border provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan.</p>
<p>Judging from the news reports, we know that the buildings along the way where the touring group went have all been spruced up, in the hope that when the members of the touring group arrive, accompanied by the sound of firecrackers and cheers, it can give a prosperous impression. This effort is painstaking, but the result of "stuffing yourself to look fat" will make the common people "suffer more for the sake of saving face." Strangely, sometimes these "sprucing up" efforts cannot be fulfilled. For example, in a certain newspaper's "Touring Chronicle," "From the vicinity of Anshun to Annam, for nearly 200 kilometers, opium poppy flowers can be seen intermittently along the way. There are even more areas farther from the road in the mountains... According to reports, because the authorities believed it was related to appearances, they ordered the opium poppy seedlings that had been planted near the road to be turned over, but opium poppy seedlings are very fertile. After being moistened by rain, they died and were resurrected, and now they have blossomed again. Therefore, although the flowering season has passed, it still leaves a glimmer of visual pleasure."</p>
<p>This is naturally very unfortunate, failing to conceal the truth. But this still belongs to the superficial level. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Annam on the 9th, "Leader Chu told reporters that since departing from Beijing, the people of the counties along the way have submitted many petitions complaining of injustice. Upon inspecting the contents of each petition, the suffering of the people due to illegal treatment is truly severe. I currently have no authority to intervene. After returning to Beijing, I will present them separately to the Executive Yuan and the Judicial Yuan, hoping that all illegal cases will be severely rectified to maintain the rule of law and protect civil rights." This dispatch is very vague, but "the suffering of the people due to illegal treatment is truly severe" is imaginable. In addition to sprucing up the streets, hosting grand banquets, and welcoming with crowds lining the streets, the common people actually secretly filed complaints with the touring group. This was unexpected by the local authorities along the way, right? And after reading about the grand welcome, we could not have imagined that the common people would dare to be so bold. However, this makes us think even more about the severity of their suffering. Although there are government offices of all sizes everywhere, they are not places for them to "file petitions complaining of injustice"!</p>
<p>Now, the common people naturally only have to wait quietly for Leader Chu's disposition "after returning to Beijing." As for us, let's see how many cases will actually have "all illegal cases severely rectified"!</p>
<p>But if our hope is not too extravagant, then we are really not satisfied with just redressing "all illegal cases," because once there are "unjust cases," the suffering of the people is already too "severe."</p>
<h3>Evading Customs</h3>
<p>— Youqi</p>
<p>— Mountain Travel Miscellany</p>
<p>Entrusting all my weary feelings to the porter, I wipe away sweat and gaze at the village ahead, wondering which one in this group, with eyes raised, eagerly yearns——</p>
<p>——How soon, we are eighty miles away from Huangqiao Ridge again! Following that, as if unwilling to let this sentence fall through, someone added: "Isn't that mountain foot a hotel!" Saying that, he also glanced at Old Zhang.</p>
<p>To this, Old Zhang was very clear. He took off his long head wrap and waved it in the air, letting the sound waves whistle, making up his mind: "It's okay to walk ten miles less"! Then, he raised the peach wood stick in his hand——</p>
<p>——Tonight we'll rest at the hotel!</p>
<p>This is a very small village. The river flows meanderingly from Huangqiao Ridge, becoming wider here. Because it is rainy season, the water has risen a lot, only two or three feet from the bank, swirling rapidly, forming countless eddies, before rushing downstream. On that side, it is close to the mountain foot, with dense aquatic plants covering the water surface. On this side, along the riverbank, is a government road, encircling the village. Saying it's a government road, it is actually not wide. The sloping mountainside cuts into the blue sky, and a row of small houses is nestled against the mountain foot. In the middle of this row of houses, guarding the entrance is the customs post for "inspecting special goods and paying taxes." Opposite, in the river, are two small boats without awnings. A white flag on the stern of the boat droops listlessly, unable to withstand the heat, and it is impossible to see clearly what is written on it.</p>
<p>It is just sunset, and the red clouds are like paper cutouts pasted on the water surface. The houses are limited, and cannot accommodate so many travelers. Fortunately, it is summer, so thick bedding is not needed. So they split up, one part moving to the left neighbor, and the other part relying on the customs post at the entrance to stay under a thatched shed.</p>
<p>It is night, and the surroundings are pitch black. Night birds let out long calls, sweeping across the sky. In an instant, it returns to the previous silence. I don't know why, but I can't fall asleep. It seems that there are all kinds of worries that can't be suppressed. The night wind blows the aquatic plants opposite, making a rustling sound. Occasionally, one or two cries of monkeys can be heard on the mountainside.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the customs officers sleeping in the customs post get up, sniffling. There are two of them. It seems that after some discussion, they anxiously grabbed a not-so-bright wind lamp and walked out. The older one said to the younger one: "Let's see where you run this time. The boss has gone to the city, huh, it's time for us to get a piece of the action"; laughter overflowing, like egrets.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they casually shined the wind lamp forward. The older one issued a warning: "Ah, the sound of water!" This is simply a bizarre drama. Following this disturbance, Lao Tie and I also got up and stood by the river, looking into the distance. Apart from a hazy moonlight and undulating aquatic plants, there was nothing. This action probably caused their displeasure. They shone the wind lamp on our faces for a while. After all, they took advantage of being outsiders and were not prohibited. They only advised us "not to make any noise." We understood what this meant, which was to avoid "scaring the snake"!</p>
<p>The night wind is strong. After waiting for a long time, nothing happened. The younger one looked unhappy, while the older one was quite confident. He shined the large flashlight he brought out on the water surface several times. It seemed like several giant pythons were chaotically falling onto the river. The water was still a series of eddies. Nothing could be seen. Only then did they lazily walk back.</p>
<p>They didn't sleep. Dominated by expectant thoughts, they sat on the long bench, constantly shining the flashlight on the mountain peak, and then on the vast road. After that, a sudden sound rose from the aquatic plants hidden in the distance, like oars hitting the water surface. So, the older one dragged the younger one, and they jumped into the small boat parked on the shore, splashing water as they rushed straight towards the sound.</p>
<p>Soon, they brought back another small boat. There were two men on the boat, their faces ashen, trembling. There were a dozen white buns under the boat, placed in front of their faces. Speaking in official dialect, it was "evading customs." Of course, it was useless to just talk empty words. So, a roll of banknotes was stuffed into their hands, exchanged for a series of triumphant laughter. With a wave of their hand—</p>
<p>The boat left. The aquatic plants hit the water surface. The trembling faces and the small boat disappeared into a vast moonlight. The surroundings were still dead silent.</p>
<h3>Rose</h3>
<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>The roses in the small garden are blooming again.</p>
<p>Every time during the rose blooming season, whenever I see the thorny vines in the small garden, with clusters of red and white roses hiding on them, I always miss my grandmother who died almost twenty years ago.</p>
<p>My grandmother was seventy-six years old when she died. I was only eight or nine years old at the time. Therefore, I was a little dazed about her death. However, her love for me is something I will never forget.</p>
<p>My grandmother's life was very thrifty. She became a widow in her twenties. Because she didn't have a child to inherit the family line, she adopted a son from a close relative. Relying on two dilapidated tile houses and cultivating a few barren mountain lands, she was able to make a living.</p>
<p>She worked from her youth until her death, never giving herself a chance to rest. Every day, she always cultivated some trees in a few mountain lands. At night, she sat under a kerosene lamp doing sewing. On rainy days, she sat at home weaving straw sandals to sell. She managed a loquat mountain and a waxberry mountain very well, and the bamboo forest in front of the door and the several acres of tea trees behind the house were envied by everyone in the village. But in her later years, her situation worsened, and she even had to look after a temple in Bao Mountain or wash clothes for the monks to maintain her remaining years.</p>
<p>My grandmother loved flowers very much when she was alive. There were all kinds of flowers on the flower altar in our courtyard, especially roses. We almost completely surrounded our place with rose thorns, and the thorns were so dense that even a small chicken could not easily get in. There were also two very high rose screen walls in front of the main gate and the back door. Whenever the roses bloomed, the fences were adorned with clusters of red and white flowers, letting the rich fragrance flow in the air.</p>
<p>Every morning, my grandmother always took a pair of scissors to prune the excess branches or tidy up some fallen buds, and she wouldn't let anyone pick a flower casually. My love for roses is perhaps due to my grandmother's inheritance! But what I like is the white rose: because I think although the red rose is charming and bright, it is not as simple and elegant as the white one. However, when the red and white colors are blooming together, they have another kind of beautiful and gorgeous style. Therefore, for several years, I can't forget the flower fence woven like brocade. Sometimes when I accidentally see a rose trellis in someone else's flower garden, it will also make me</p>

<h3>Sai Jinhua</h3>
<p>— Chen Hezhi</p>
<p>Nineteen</p>
<p>After Beijing was captured by the Allied Forces, the scene was truly tragic and unbearable to witness, especially for women. They usually suffered all kinds of deception and humiliation, and in wartime, they were ravaged by soldiers and enemy soldiers, but to whom could they complain? Fortunately, Sai Jinhua had learned a foreign language during her time in the West, and inquired that the commander of the Allied Forces, Waldersee, was an old friend.</p>
<p>Thinking of the rose fence planted by my grandmother, from the shadow of the remaining rose flowers, I seemed to see my grandmother's kind smile.</p>
<p>In the third year after my grandmother passed away, my father also passed away. So, for the sake of life, I followed my mother and left my warm home, leaving my beloved hometown. I returned to my hometown the following year to sweep the tomb, but the rose vines had been chopped and broken beyond recognition, and there was not even a trace of the surrounding fences.</p>
<p>So I transplanted those roses next to my grandmother's grave, but not long after, they were cut down by the children who were cutting grass. However, now every year when the roses bloom, there are also a few wild roses that will climb lonely around the tomb, spreading a strong fragrance to accompany the lonely soul in the tomb.</p>
<p>The roses in the small garden are blooming again.</p>
<p>Silently, I reached out and picked a white rose and a red rose to insert on my grandmother's grave.</p>
<h3>Tragedy of Cutting Off a Finger to Advise One's Father</h3>
<p>Whenever something reaches the point where someone needs to advise, the seriousness of the situation can be imagined. In ancient China, there was a "Council of Advisers" for speaking to the emperor. But since the change of dynasties, things like advice have long been abolished. However, there are still things similar to this kind of behavior, such as the suicide of several Japanese soldiers in previous years to protest their government's invasion of Manchuria, the recent suicide of Ruan Zewen by Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing to advise our government, and the so-called military advice of the December incident last year... and so on. However, these are mostly advice concerning major national affairs, and are completely different from the advice of ordinary people in their private lives or behavior. For example, a son advising his father is one example.</p>
<p>According to recent reports: There is a man named Zhao Laoer from Yancheng whose wife has been dead for many years, leaving behind one son and three daughters. The son, named Baoshan, is currently twenty-two years old and is quite honest. But the father, who is over half a century old, often seeks out prostitutes outside. Baoshan repeatedly advised him but he would not listen. Recently, he became involved with an old woman from the same village, Hu, and moved her into the house, seemingly like an old couple. The children (commonly known as "oil bottles") of Hu's former husband also came home with their mother. From then on, half-brothers and sisters often had disputes, and Hu instead instigated them to beat Baoshan and his sisters. One day before noon, Baoshan could not bear the abuse and suffering. Out of resentment, he raised a kitchen knife and chopped off two sections of his left index finger to advise his father, and wrote the four blood-red characters "Severed Finger Memorial" on white paper with fresh blood. Later, the neighbors drove Baoshan to the Red Cross on Haige Road for treatment. Because the injury was not serious, he was bandaged and discharged from the hospital." Although this only speaks of family trivialities, a tragedy of severed fingers has already appeared under this "advice." Although the severed finger resulted in "little bleeding and no serious injury," it inadvertently illustrates the existence of a social tragedy.</p>
<p>It is common for a father to seek prostitutes and remarry after the death of his wife. But precisely because it is common, it is more likely to form the cause of this type of tragedy. Not long ago, there was a bittersweet drama caused by a father's remarriage, which resulted in the children making a big scene at the wedding hall. This makes it even more conceivable that this sorrow of severing a finger to advise a father is not an accidental event.</p>
<p>Advising to the point of bloodshed or suicide, whether for the country or for the family, is inevitably a bit foolish, but to eliminate this foolish behavior, one must embody its sincere intent and accept this advice.</p>
