<h3>昨大隊日軍通過公共租界</h3>
<p>警務處予以充分戒備　南京路旁突來手溜彈　一華人呼口號跳窗死日兵搜查禁通行至九時止</p>
<p>昨日上午十一時、大隊日軍約六千人、包括步兵騎兵砲兵工兵輜重兵等、由滬西中山路豐田紗廠、整隊出發、經極司非而路•愚園路•海格路•福煦路•愛多亞路•虞洽鄉路•南京路•外灘、過白渡橋而達虹口、事前公共租界警務處方面、曾在日軍經過地段、予以充分戒備、禁止車馬通行、並嚴阻閒雜人等在附近里弄間停留等等、故當時所經各地段內、完全沉寂、巡行日軍、係行列式、三人一排、由日軍上級軍官為導、隨後首為步兵、而以騎兵殿之、所有日僑咸手持太陽旗、在隊後附隊而進、同時另有日軍飛機五架、在低空盤旋、掩護行列、</p>
<p>當正午十二時四十四分、在日軍大隊行列經過虞洽卿路、折入南京路向東行進、將近廣西路口時、突有一手溜彈、自路口所站人叢中拋出、落於日軍行列之旁、立起爆炸、當塲炸傷日兵三人、印捕一名、西探一人、華捕一名、路面亦被炸力損毀、成一碗形、深約三英寸之洞、當時站立最近之第二五○九號華捕、目睹斯情、立卽向擲彈人發槍兩響、當塲將其擊倒於廣西路廣寒宮理髮館門首馬路上、斯時日軍行列立卽停止進行、所有隊兵齊上剌刀、凖備殿後之馬隊、亦同時調前、與三十餘名步兵、在出事地點、四週搜索、並實行佈防、並將已被擊倒之靑年圍住、租界警務人員出動更多、在東西兩端佈崗、卽商店內購物人等、亦暫時禁止走動、日軍官數人於出事後、二分鐘內、首先趕到、且有武裝軍車三輛、隨後到達、數分鐘後、卽指派步兵七十餘人、與若干機械部隊、由軍官數人指揮、留守出事地點、其餘行列仍舊、依照預定行程前進、循外灘而達虹口、被炸傷者分別送醫、</p>
<p>留守日軍、於大隊行列經過後、卽在雲南路與浙江路間之南京路上、分別警戒、並着手檢查一切界內所留人等、惟西人除外、而俄籍僑民亦同樣不得出入警戒綫、斯項工作、直至當晚六七時、尚未完竣、而警戒仍未撤除、惟該擲彈靑年、據悉當時係受重傷、故經於斯時運去、着手偵訊、內容未詳、直至當晚九時左右、日軍在南京路警戒而兼檢查工作、方始完竣、其部隊亦卽撤回虹口、至於該案偵查之眞相、與經過、則無切實公報、故尚無從探悉、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今日日兵六千名、由極司非而區、列隊游行至虹口、下午一時四十五分、行至公共租界中心南京路廣西路轉角時、忽有華人或韓人一名擲一手溜彈、傷日兵三名、擲彈者為巡捕當塲開槍擊倒、又外國警官一員亦受傷、一時形勢頓見緊張、日兵皆上刺刀、日騎兵展開入橫街搜查、道旁觀者皆驚亂四散、致廣西路遺有鞋物甚多、但未幾日兵復集隊沿南京路前進、僅留軍官與騎兵一小隊、駐於肇事之地、今日下午當局仍在從事澈查、大美晚報付印時、擲彈者之屍仍伏於馬路上、日兵於上午十一時、由豐田紗廠出廠、給滬杭鐵路軌道、經過英兵防綫、取道白利南路•愚園路•海格路•福煦路•虞洽卿路•南京路•黃浦灘而進、最後之隊伍、於下午一時四十五分經過外白渡橋、公共租界與法租界之警務人員、當時皆全體出防、以防發生意外、當日兵經過愚園路時、有華人一名、圖由隙處越隊而至對街、爲日兵拘獲、擁入汽車駛去、旋過大世界前、有華人一名、自愛多亞路八百六十號住屋三層樓窗中躍下、口呼“中華民國萬歲”、墜於樓下有刺鐵絲障碍物上而死、</p>
<p>日兵經過南京路廣西路轉角處、有華人一名、自南首擲一手溜彈、彈落路上爆炸、傷日兵三名之腿部、至少尚傷日平民一名、又傷中國平民數名、西副捕頭麥克菲右臂與腿受微傷、現信尚有印捕頭一被中、另有觀者數人、衣服爲彈片穿過、炸聲發作後、日兵立卽止步、騎兵衝入橫街、步兵則上剌刀隨於其後、南京路上初集觀者甚衆、至是逃避一空、商店多上牌門、但橫街與小弄中、皆集有驚惶之羣衆、中西探捕聞警皆持槍到塲、華捕二五○九號目覩擲彈者、卽向連開四槍、兩中其胸、乃倒於路上、惟未卽斃命、日兵與巡捕皆集於四局、向之問話、其餘日兵則在附近一帶搜查、下午一時零二分一旦兵回至原屬、復列隊前進、</p>
<p>大美晚報付印時、日兵六十至八十名、在擲彈地佈哨綫甚廣、自雲南路起至浙江路止、南京路上與橫街皆不許平民行走、日兵皆上剌刀、駐於各地點、擲彈者之屍仍臥於倒處、已否氣絕未悉、日軍高級司令、現會同公共租界警務處澈查是案、並將舉行騐屍、</p>

<h3>The Isolated Army Supported for a Hundred Hours, Jiangyin Fort Fell</h3>
<p>I reluctantly withdrew at seven o'clock last night. The area above Jiangyin has been heavily blockaded. There were fierce battles in the suburbs of Danyang.</p>
<p>Reliable sources say that the Jiangyin Fort has been under a joint land, sea, and air attack by the Japanese for the past four or five days. Its left and right flanks, rear, and even top have been subjected to fierce attacks by the latest weapons. It can be said that it was facing enemies on five sides. Our local garrison, using their flesh and blood as a strong fortress to compensate for the lack of material resources, fought bravely and resisted for about a hundred hours. Finally, due to the isolation of the garrison and the backwardness of their weapons, they had to reluctantly withdraw at around seven o'clock last night (the 2nd). Although Jiangyin is the first gateway to our mighty Yangtze River, we have recently tightly closed and heavily blockaded the gateway above Jiangyin. If the Japanese army tries to move further west, they will inevitably encounter even stronger resistance. Furthermore, the Japanese army on the northern route of the right wing, after invading Shimenwan from Puyuan, was counterattacked by our forces on the 2nd. When they reached Shimenwan, the Japanese army retreated immediately due to their limited troop strength.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the war reports obtained by this newspaper from various sources yesterday: ㊀ Danyang area: According to Japanese sources, the Japanese army's units, including the Katagiri and Ono units, had completely occupied the county seat by yesterday morning. The Japanese army is waiting for the rear reinforcement troops to arrive before setting off for Zhenjiang. However, according to other reliable sources, there was fierce fighting between the two sides in the city of Danyang. The situation is indeed very tense, but it has not yet fallen. ㊁ Liyang area: The Japanese also claim to have occupied it and are advancing towards Lishui. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, they reached Shijiaqiao, twenty kilometers ahead of Lishui. However, since the fall of Yixing to our side, although the Japanese army has continued to advance west, attempting to attack Liyang and Lishui, threatening the flanks of Danyang and Zhenjiang, our forces have deployed heavy troops in Chengtangqiao, Xushe Town, Hongta City, Dushan Dang, and other places, and fought bravely. Only in the city of Liyang was a group of plainclothes soldiers discovered, and the situation seemed slightly chaotic. The claim of its fall is still difficult to confirm. Another report says that the Japanese are still focusing their main force between Changxing and Yi, and are constantly reinforcing their troops.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Land Near Tongzhou</h3>
<p>[Hankou] In North China, except for some contact near Taiyuan, the war situation is quite calm. Both China and Japan are currently gathering large armies to prepare for a major battle that will determine the fate of Nanjing. The Chinese side here is quite pleased with the setbacks the Japanese army has encountered this week and the recovery of Guangde. It is also said that the progress of the Japanese army on the Yangtze River has been greatly restricted due to the penetration of two Chinese divisions near Jiangyin. And the national defense lines in various parts of China have also been greatly strengthened due to the arrival of fresh troops. The Japanese side is now working hard to destroy the Jiangyin water barrier in order to allow Japanese warships to move west. It is said that the water barrier has already been damaged by shelling. The Japanese army is now clearing the nearby mines. The landing of the Japanese army near Tongzhou is an attempt to stop the activities of the Chinese artillery on the north bank of the Yangtze River, as the artillery near Tongzhou is being used to protect the Jiangyin water barrier. (2nd National Maritime Telegram)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] It is reported that yesterday, multiple Japanese aircraft flew to the Tianxing Port fort on the opposite bank of Jiangyin and carried out a large-scale bombing, attempting to destroy the Chinese military works there and then land on the north bank to attack the rear of Jiangyin. (3rd Express News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Carrier Anchored at Shidongkou</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the British Swire Company's Wuhu steamer arrived in Shanghai from Tongzhou. According to passengers on board, the attack on Jiangyin was very fierce, and the fort fired many shells. The sound of artillery fire had gradually decreased yesterday. Currently, there are about eight or nine Japanese warships on the Jiangyin River near Fuchangsha, all of which are destroyers and gunboats. There are no cruisers there. However, there is one Japanese aircraft carrier anchored at Shidongkou. Yesterday morning, four seaplanes took off from the aircraft carrier and reconnoitered over the Jiangyin fort. After about two hours, they returned to the aircraft carrier. Along the route of the steamer's arrival in Shanghai, the number of Japanese warships seen was greatly reduced. The Japanese warships in the waters outside Langshan have also been moved away. There are about forty-five Japanese transport ships outside the Wusongkou, and no more than eight Japanese warships.</p>
<h3>Our Guerrilla Force is Exceptionally Active</h3>
<p>According to external sources, our guerrilla force has been extremely active in Linghu, Nanxun, and Wuxing for the past few days. On the morning of the 2nd, when the Japanese army arrived at Linghu, they were fiercely attacked by our troops, and the Japanese army suffered considerable losses. Wang Hua, an officer of the puppet Manchukuo army, was also captured by our forces.</p>
<h3>Japanese Response: Respect the Safety of the Nanjing Refugee Zone Within Possible Limits</h3>
<p>The International Relief Committee Has Decided to Proceed with Arrangements</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to today's news, the Japanese authorities have replied to the International Relief Committee, saying that they will respect the safety of the Nanjing Refugee Zone within possible limits. Although the committee has not received a definite reply from the Japanese side, it has now begun to prepare all matters related to protecting the refugees in the zone. (2nd National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Nanjing Safety Zone Committee stated this morning that they received a telegram from Father Rao in Shanghai, stating that the Japanese authorities have received the request to establish a safety zone in Nanjing, but regret that they cannot approve this request. If the Chinese army engages in improper behavior towards civilians or property, the Japanese army cannot be responsible. However, the Japanese army will strive to respect the area, adhering to the principle of not compromising military necessity. The committee has now decided to proceed with arrangements, pending a direct response from the Japanese side. It is noted that Father Rao's telegram was the result of the committee's telegram on November 29 requesting Father Rao to intercede with the Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe, etc. The committee appointed Fei Wusheng, a secretary of the YMCA, as the director of the secretariat on Tuesday, and organized four sections for finance, housing, food, and hygiene. Funds of 100,000 yuan have been pledged. Mayor Ma of Nanjing has promised to provide 30,000 bags of rice. Preliminary preparations have been made for the housing problem, and police have been assigned to maintain order within the zone. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Passing of the Panchen Lama</h3>
<p>New Delhi: According to today's news, the Panchen Lama passed away on November 20 near Jekundo (transliteration) in western China. Before receiving a radio message confirming his death, news had come from Lhasa stating that the Panchen Lama was ill and that various Lama temples were holding religious ceremonies to pray for his early recovery. It is noted that the Panchen Lama had been away from Tibet for thirteen years and had recently planned to return, but ultimately did not succeed. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>U.S. Orders All Nationals to Leave Beijing as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The U.S. State Department today instructed all U.S. nationals here to leave Beijing as soon as possible and evacuate to safe areas. However, about fifteen U.S. missionaries, teachers, and doctors informed the U.S. Embassy after receiving the notice that they were unwilling to leave due to their professional responsibilities.

In addition, there are several women from other countries living on the mooring ship, but five American women are still in the city. Those foreigners who are staying in the city are prepared to board the ship immediately in case of emergency. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Foreign Residents of Hankou Live in Peace as Usual</h3>
<p>[Hankou] Hankou, where the temporary Chinese government is located, has now become a refuge camp for refugees. Thousands of refugees arrive here every day, gathering on the streets and obstructing traffic. The movement of Chinese troops "comes and goes" without ceasing, and the iron birds in the sky constantly roar. However, the public concession of Hankou is as quiet as usual. Foreigners living in it live in peace and are not surprised, as if they are unaware of the incident. As for the citizens in other parts, they pack their belongings and carry the old and young, preparing to go deeper inland. The only thing that foreign nationals in Hankou need to consider is how to send women and children to Hong Kong. (3rd National Maritime Telegram)</p>

Eleven were repelled by our aircraft at Tangshan, and the remaining four took the opportunity to intrude. Our anti-aircraft artillery fired intensively.

<h3>Yesterday a Large Unit of Japanese Troops Passed Through the Public Concession</h3>
<p>The Police Department Gave Full Precautions. A Hand Grenade Suddenly Came from the Side of Nanjing Road. A Chinese Man Shouted Slogans and Jumped Out of the Window and Died. Japanese Soldiers Searched and Prohibited Passage Until Nine O'Clock.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, a large unit of Japanese troops, about 6,000 men, including infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineers, and logistics troops, departed from the Toyota Textile Factory on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai. They marched through Great Western Road, Yu Yuen Road, Haig Road, Avenue Foch, Avenue Edward VII, Rue Chapsal, Nanking Road, and the Bund, crossed the Garden Bridge, and arrived at Hongkou. In advance, the Police Department of the Public Concession had taken full precautions in the sections through which the Japanese troops passed, prohibiting the passage of vehicles and horses and strictly preventing idlers from staying in the nearby alleys. Therefore, the sections passed through at that time were completely silent. The patrolling Japanese troops were in a row of three, led by Japanese senior officers, followed by infantry, and cavalry at the rear. All Japanese expatriates held Japanese flags and followed the team. At the same time, five Japanese aircraft circled at low altitude, covering the ranks.</p>
<p>At 12:44 PM, when a large unit of Japanese troops was passing through Rue Chapsal, turning into Nanking Road and heading east, near the intersection of Kwangsi Road, a hand grenade suddenly came from the crowd standing at the intersection and landed beside the Japanese ranks. An explosion immediately occurred, injuring three Japanese soldiers, one Indian policeman, one Western detective, and one Chinese policeman on the spot. The road surface was also damaged by the explosion, forming a bowl-shaped hole about three inches deep. The Chinese policeman No. 2509, who was standing closest, witnessed the situation and immediately fired two shots at the grenade thrower, knocking him down on the street in front of the Kwanghan Palace barber shop on Kwangsi Road. At this time, the Japanese ranks immediately stopped moving. All the soldiers put on their bayonets, and the cavalry prepared to guard the rear. At the same time, they moved forward with more than thirty infantrymen and searched around the scene and implemented defenses. More concession police officers were dispatched, posting guards at both the east and west ends, and even shoppers in the stores were temporarily prohibited from moving. Several Japanese officers arrived at the scene within two minutes after the incident, followed by three armed military vehicles. After a few minutes, they dispatched more than seventy infantrymen and some mechanical units, commanded by several officers, to stay at the scene, while the rest of the ranks continued to advance according to the planned route, following the Bund and reaching Hongkou. The injured were sent to the hospital separately.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops who stayed behind guarded Nanking Road between Yunnan Road and Chekiang Road after the main ranks passed and began to inspect all those remaining within the boundary, except for Westerners. Russian expatriates were also not allowed to enter or leave the cordon. This work had not been completed until 6:00 or 7:00 PM that night, and the cordon had not been lifted. However, the grenade thrower was reportedly seriously injured at the time, so he was taken away at that time for interrogation. The details are unknown. It was not until around 9:00 PM that the Japanese army's guard and inspection work on Nanking Road was completed, and its troops withdrew to Hongkou. As for the truth and process of the case investigation, there is no reliable public announcement, so it is still impossible to find out.</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Wan Bao (Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury) reported that 6,000 Japanese soldiers marched in a procession from the Great Western Road area to Hongkou today. At 1:45 PM, when they reached the corner of Nanking Road and Kwangsi Road in the center of the Public Concession, a Chinese or Korean man suddenly threw a hand grenade, injuring three Japanese soldiers. The grenade thrower was shot and killed on the spot by a patrol officer. A foreign police officer was also injured. The situation suddenly became tense. The Japanese soldiers all put on their bayonets, and the Japanese cavalry deployed to search the side streets. The spectators on the roadside were all scattered in panic, leaving many shoes and other items on Kwangsi Road. However, the Japanese soldiers soon regrouped and continued to advance along Nanking Road, leaving only a small team of officers and cavalry stationed at the scene of the incident. The authorities were still investigating the incident this afternoon. The body of the grenade thrower was still lying on the road when the Da Mei Wan Bao went to press. The Japanese soldiers left the factory at Toyota Textile Factory at 11:00 AM, passed the British troops' defense line on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and took the route of Brenan Road, Yu Yuen Road, Haig Road, Avenue Foch, Rue Chapsal, Nanking Road, and the Bund. The last team passed the Garden Bridge at 1:45 PM. The police officers of the Public Concession and the French Concession were all on duty at that time to prevent accidents. When the Japanese soldiers passed Yu Yuen Road, a Chinese man tried to cross the street through a gap in the ranks, but was arrested by the Japanese soldiers and taken away in a car. Later, in front of the Great World, a Chinese man jumped from the third-floor window of the house at 860 Avenue Edward VII, shouted "Long live the Republic of China", and fell to his death on the barbed wire obstacles below.</p>
<p>When the Japanese soldiers passed the corner of Nanking Road and Kwangsi Road, a Chinese man threw a hand grenade from the south, and the grenade exploded on the road, injuring three Japanese soldiers in the legs and at least one Japanese civilian. Several Chinese civilians were also injured. Western Deputy Inspector MacFie suffered minor injuries to his right arm and leg. It is now believed that an Indian inspector was also hit. Several spectators also had their clothes pierced by shrapnel. After the explosion, the Japanese soldiers immediately stopped. The cavalry rushed into the side streets, and the infantry followed with bayonets. There were many spectators gathered on Nanking Road, but they all fled. Many shops put up their doors, but crowds of frightened people gathered in the side streets and alleys. Chinese and Western detectives arrived at the scene with guns after hearing the alarm. Chinese policeman No. 2509 witnessed the grenade thrower and immediately fired four shots, two of which hit him in the chest, and he fell to the ground, but he did not die immediately. The Japanese soldiers and patrol officers gathered in the fourth bureau and interrogated him. The remaining Japanese soldiers searched in the nearby area. At 1:02 PM, a team of soldiers returned to their original positions and resumed their march.</p>
<p>When the Da Mei Wan Bao went to press, 60 to 80 Japanese soldiers were stationed on a wide cordon at the grenade throwing site, from Yunnan Road to Chekiang Road. Pedestrians were not allowed to walk on Nanking Road and the side streets. The Japanese soldiers were all armed with bayonets and stationed at various locations. The body of the grenade thrower was still lying where he fell. It is not known if he had died. The senior Japanese commander is currently investigating the case with the Police Department of the Public Concession and will conduct an autopsy.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Japanese army originally planned to go to the South City from Hongkou along the Bund today, but it is now heard that the plan has been cancelled.</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Wan Bao reported that when the Japanese authorities met with news reporters this morning (the 3rd), they revealed that the Shanghai Consular Corps had expressed its views to the Japanese Consul General, advising the Japanese army not to make today's parade. However, it is heard that this opinion was expressed informally and did not take the form of a formal note. It also said that it is not for us to comment on whether it is advisable for more than 5,000 Japanese troops to move from the Great Western Road area to Hongkou via another route. This army may be transferred to the South City tomorrow, but this plan cannot be confirmed today. In view of the fact that Chinese aircraft attacked the Izumo yesterday, the Japanese army felt that it should be protected by land army aircraft. When a reporter asked what activities these aircraft would carry out during the parade, the spokesperson replied that he could not say for sure, but he believed that they were unlikely to carry bombs, because the Public Concession Police Department was taking strict precautions and there was no need for this. We believe that this parade will not cause any accidents. The reporter also stated that foreigners in Shanghai are quite alarmed by this transfer of Japanese troops. The Japanese spokesperson also made an explanatory reply. Rumors outside say that when the Japanese army paraded today, the Concession authorities, fearing that the police force was weak and insufficient to suppress the crowd, requested that foreign troops stationed in the area cooperate in guarding the route. U.S. military officers all denied this claim.</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Wan Bao reported that after the bomb incident on Nanking Road this afternoon, Japanese soldiers set up a cordon on Nanking Road from Fukien Road to Rue Chapsal, and placed movable barbed wire obstacles, which were extended to various side streets. Pedestrians were prohibited from entering or leaving the cordon. At about 3:20 PM, a Japanese patrol team went west to Jessfield Road and entered the U.S. military defense zone, placing obstacles in front of the Grand Theatre, guarded by one officer and two sentries, and stopping traffic. At 4:30 PM, Colonel Puraes, commander of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment, and another officer arrived at the scene and met with the Japanese officer. The Japanese officer stated that he was unaware of the boundary line of the U.S. military defense zone and removed the obstacles to Rue Chapsal. As a result, Jessfield Road was able to pass through again. The houses within the Japanese soldiers' cordon are now believed to have been searched door-to-door, and Chinese and foreigners have also been inspected and sent out of the cordon by the Municipal Council police. At that time, the cordon was becoming wider and wider. Chinese and foreigners who did not know about it and crossed it were beaten by Japanese officers and sentries. Among the foreigners were several Germans and Americans. At that time, even a team of British soldiers was blocked outside the cordon. British officers in military cars and police officers on motorcycles were also stopped. However, at dusk, the Japanese soldiers took the Municipal Council Police Department-supplied cars and retreated to Hongkou one after another. Because the case has been thoroughly investigated, it is expected that the Nanking Road and Kwangsi Road area will be able to return to normal tonight. The results of the investigation are not yet known.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Chinese or Korean grenade thrower who was shot down by the Chinese policeman died at the corner of Nanking Road and Kwangsi Road at 2:00 PM. The shot was left unrepaired, and the Japanese soldiers did not allow him to be moved or given medical treatment. He is now covered with a white cloth. According to the Japanese military police, the person is a Korean revolutionary party member who has been wanted by the Japanese authorities for a long time.</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Wan Bao reported that Mr. Middleton, a 54-year-old British lawyer who has lived in Shanghai for many years and has a good reputation, was watching the Japanese army parade on Nanking Road today. A Japanese ronin, carrying a bundle of Japanese flags under his arm, saw his countrymen and handed them one. Then he took another one and forced it into Mr. Middleton's hand, hoping that he would join the celebration. After Mr. Middleton took the flag, he silently broke it on his lap. The ronin was furious when he saw this. At that time, a Japanese officer stepped forward to make things difficult for Mr. Middleton. Although Mr. Middleton was good at words, he did not want to waste his breath and punched him in the face. At a time when his life was in danger, fortunately, a Municipal Council police officer rushed to the scene, arrested Mr. Middleton in a car, and sent him to the police station.</p>
<p>Mr. Reed, a 73-year-old American, fought with eight Japanese sailors, including three officers, on Tibet Road this afternoon. Mr. Reed said, I am a law-abiding American and have the right to self-respect. I was walking quietly on the road when a team of Japanese sentries came, and one of the officers pushed me in the back and said something rude. I have never been treated like this in my life, so I raised my fist and hit him in the lip. The officer then pointed to the bleeding area and showed it to the other two officers. Then another person rushed towards me, so I hit him in the nose. At that time, everyone rushed up and beat me on the head. I was not injured, but my glasses were deeply sunken, but the glass was not broken. They also drew their pistols. Mr. Zhuo, who was passing by, was also pushed.</p>

<h3>German Ambassador to China Trautmann Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Speculation on German Mediation Becomes More Credible, But Berlin Official Circles Remain Tight-Lipped</p>
<p>[Nanjing] German Ambassador Trautmann arrived here from Hankou today. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Reliable sources acknowledge that German Ambassador to China Trautmann is currently in Nanjing discussing matters with Chairman Chiang. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the rumors of German mediation in the Sino-Japanese dispute, responsible officials here recently stated that there is no basis for such claims, and that the German authorities have previously denied them. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Chinese Embassy here solemnly declares that although the German Ambassador to China is visiting Nanjing, peace negotiations are unlikely to materialize. It also stated that the Chinese government's move to the interior is entirely due to its determination to resist Japan in the long term. Japan today not only seeks to threaten China's survival and independence, but also endangers the security of international treaties and the interests of all nations. Therefore, China has no hope of immediate compromise with Japan. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Today, various circles in Germany are very interested in the news of German mediation in the Sino-Japanese dispute. A spokesperson told a Reuters reporter, "I know nothing about this matter. No such event is currently underway." (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the rumors of German mediation in the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Labour Party's "Daily Herald" recently published an article stating, "Although the German government has denied the mediation, it has not denied that it intends to mediate if the opportunity arises. German leader Hitler does not want Soviet Russia to gain a foothold, and it is true that he wants to encourage China to participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact. His efforts for peace are noteworthy, as he must seek reasonable terms in order to gain China's friendship, so that the Chinese government does not consider it too unfair." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspaper Publishes Article Criticizing Democratic Nations</h3>
<p>Attributed to Mussolini, Saying Italy Would Rather Have Cannons Than Butter</p>
<p>[Rome] The "New York Times" recently published an article stating that the best way for democratic nations to deal with authoritarian nations is for them to implement economic cooperation. Today, the "Italian Daily" published an article, reportedly written by Prime Minister Mussolini himself, in response to the "New York Times," stating, "Britain, the United States, and France are now preparing an economic war, attempting to strangle the economic lifelines of the 'totalitarian states,' forcing them to resort to war. The people of the totalitarian states, threatened by economic blockade and starvation, have only one way to deal with this: to prepare with all their strength, determination, and weapons. In short, if butter and cannons are mutually exclusive, then Italy would rather have cannons than butter." General observers believe that since the announcement of trade negotiations between Britain and the United States, Italian newspapers have not mentioned a word about it. However, today's article in the "Italian People's Daily" truly represents Italy's reaction to the trade negotiations between Britain and the United States, as Italy deeply fears that once the Anglo-American agreement is concluded, it will pose a great danger to the Italian economy. Therefore, it considers this an act of aggression by the democratic nations against Italy. Furthermore, during the Abyssinian War, Britain, France, and other countries imposed economic sanctions on Italy, which Italy has never forgotten. Although the economic restrictions imposed during the Abyssinian War were lifted a year ago, they are now likely to be reinstated due to economic difficulties. For this reason, Italian newspapers have recently attacked the democratic nations with unprecedented ferocity. General observers believe that the intention is to make the Italian people believe that France intends to engage in war. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Chiang Baili's Speech on Sino-German Friendship</h3>
<p>Germany Recognizes Manchukuo, Not Likely to Happen Soon</p>
<p>⊙Hamburg Chinese Special Envoy to Germany Chiang Baili, accompanied by Chinese Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang, arrived here from Berlin by train today. Dr. Ritzde of the East Asia Association welcomed them at the station. After Mr. Chiang alighted from the train, he went straight to the Four Seasons Hotel, where the East Asia Association held a meeting to welcome him. Many celebrities attended. First, the chairman of the association, Mr. Riffiri, delivered a speech. Then, Mr. Chiang stood up and delivered a speech, first mentioning the German ship that sailed from Hamburg to China a hundred years ago, which made China first aware of German machinery. Afterwards, China's belief in all German manufactured industrial products increased, creating a phenomenon of welcoming German goods to enter the country. Mr. Chiang said that recently, countries have been advocating self-sufficiency, but according to what he believes, even if there is self-sufficiency, it does not mean severing relations with other countries. Regarding the Xi'an Incident last year, Mr. Chiang strongly denied the claim that this incident was related to the communist movement, and presented proof based on the fact that he stayed in Xi'an with Chairman Chiang during the incident. Mr. Chiang declared that there was nothing else that changed General Zhang Xueliang's attitude other than Chairman Chiang's diary. If you compare China with other countries, you will know that China is a country of moral concepts, or a country of communist thought. Believing that Germans share the same moral principles, we know that China and Germany will definitely be able to understand each other deeply. He firmly expressed his belief in the solid foundation of friendship that already exists between the two countries and hoped for the continuation of trade between the two countries. In the afternoon, the Chinese Consulate General in Hamburg held a tea party to welcome Mr. Chiang. Mr. Chiang left Hamburg in the evening. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the issue of the German government recognizing "Manchukuo," responsible officials here recently declared that this matter is unlikely to materialize in the immediate future. However, in order to express the friendly relations between Germany and Japan, the German government may eventually have to recognize "Manchukuo" after some time. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Today, qualified people here do not believe in the rumors that Germany is about to recognize "Manchukuo," and say that Italy's position in the Far East is very different from Germany's. They believe that recognizing "Manchukuo" at present will have a negative impact on Sino-German relations. Finally, they said that Germany has considerable interests in the Chinese market, and since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Germany's export trade to China has been severely hit.

The newspaper also stated that Foreign Minister Hirota declared to the cabinet that the rumors that Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe recently stated in a meeting with reporters that Japan would negotiate with Chairman Chiang when negotiating peace with China do not represent the opinion of the Japanese government.

<h3>Japanese Diplomacy Active in Europe</h3>
<p>Ishii Departs for France from Italy, Goto Visits German Foreign Minister</p>
<p>[Rome] Former Japanese Foreign Minister and current Privy Councilor Ishii departed from here for Paris at 11 o'clock this morning. Japanese Ambassador to Italy Horita and embassy staff went to the station to see him off. Responsible officials have adopted an extremely reserved attitude regarding Ishii's meeting with Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday, but most attach great importance to it. General observers believe that Ishii is a privy councilor, so his mission is even more important than the Japanese goodwill envoy Okura, who came to Italy recently. Ishii declined to issue any political statements to the Havas reporter, only saying that he first met Prime Minister Mussolini fifteen years ago when the Fascist Party began to govern, and he is very happy to meet him again this time. He also said that he had served as the ambassador to France for a long time, and he is very happy to revisit his old haunts this time, and plans to spend Christmas in Paris. It is reported that after Ishii goes to Paris, he plans to go to other European capitals, and then return to Paris soon. He will also hold talks with government officials and political leaders of the countries he passes through. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Lloyd George Worried About Britain's Position</h3>
<p>The Seriousness of the Far East Situation Has Never Been Greater</p>
<p>[London] British Prime Minister during the European War, Lloyd George, gave a speech at the "Action Peace Building Association" today, saying, "Whenever an international crisis occurs, democratic countries invariably follow the old ways, shirking responsibilities and allowing authoritarian countries to achieve their great desires of voracious appetite. Now, the tiger in the Far East is devouring its prey again. If you want to scare away this tiger, it will definitely not work by making a few gestures." Lloyd George also said, "Since the European War, Britain's position has never been more serious than it is today. When the Second World War breaks out, the Mediterranean will definitely be blocked by others. Since Italy conquered the Abyssinians, sea transportation will also be cut off by the Italians at any time. Now, Germany and Italy are engaged in the management of Spain. If this work is completed, Britain will be in a state of utter defeat, or in a state of immobility, when the Second World War breaks out." (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<h3>British Army Cadre Reorganization Adapts to Modern Warfare</h3>
<p>Promoting Young Officers to Key Positions, Actively Implementing the Great National Defense Plan</p>
<p>[London] The British War Office announced today that there has been a major reorganization of the Army Council in order to adapt to the development of new-style warfare. Three members of the Council's Military Committee will resign as a result, and be replaced by young officers. Viscount Gort, who was stationed in Shanghai with the military in 1927, will be promoted to Chief of the Imperial General Staff, while the position of Deputy Chief of Staff will be given to Adams, the commander of the 1st Division Artillery. According to War Office sources, the aim of this reorganization is to enable officers holding key staff positions in the country to have closer access to the central trends of army policy. It is expected that the reorganization will be completed by the end of the year. Britain is currently implementing a great plan to reorganize its armaments and actively defend the country. The authorities have conducted a very detailed investigation into whether the existing organization is truly suitable for exercising the policy that is inseparable from this great plan, and the result is this change. According to the authorities, this is a psychological issue. After young soldiers take up key positions in the Army Council, War Minister Hore-Belisha can use new ideas to instill strength into the army. After the army administration undergoes this reorganization, military promotions will be based on merit and talent. The previous concepts of promoting officials based on seniority and qualifications will be completely abolished. The average age of the military committee members of the Military Council, which used to be 63, will be changed to 52 after this reorganization. Viscount Gort was previously a guard, but now he has been promoted to Chief of Staff, which is rare. One more thing to note is that important British generals such as Lieutenant General Dill and General Wavell will be assigned other tasks so that they can serve as commanders of field troops in the event of an emergency. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>[London] War Minister Hore-Belisha recently made major changes to the army's cadre generals, the purpose of which is to refresh the army and give important positions to outstanding talents, so that they can cope with events with ease once something happens. In addition, with regard to the army's establishment, all existing outdated regulations will also be abolished in order to satisfy the claims for army democratization put forward by the left-wing parties. Among them, with regard to the transfer of cadre generals, the War Office recently issued a public statement saying that among the four members of the Military Senate Council, in addition to the Chief of Ordnance Department, Vice Admiral Blanc, remaining in office, the other three, namely Chief of the General Staff of the Army General Deverell, Director General of Military Administration of the Army Lieutenant General Knox, and Director General of Supply of the Army General Ayers, have all voluntarily resigned. The younger General Gort will succeed as Chief of the General Staff of the Army, and Major General Liddell will succeed as Director General of Military Administration. As for the post of Director General of Supply, it will be concurrently held by the Chief of Ordnance Department, Vice Admiral Blanc. In addition, Major General Wavell, commander of the British garrison in Palestine, will be reassigned as commander of the Southern Military Region of England from April next year. The post of commander of the garrison in Palestine will be succeeded by Major General Haining. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Consult with the Netherlands, Portugal, and Other Countries on Naval Cooperation</h3>
<p>Jointly Protect Interests in the Far East, France Strengthens Air Defense in Vietnam</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the situation in the Far East, members of the British Parliament are now discussing a question, namely, whether Britain should strengthen its fleet in that region if the situation in the Far East continues to worsen. In addition, the news that Japanese naval marines have occupied Chixi Island in Guangdong has not been confirmed, but it is generally true that a small number of Japanese soldiers have landed on the island. It is generally believed that the activities of the Japanese army in certain places in China are enough to hinder the interests maintained by Britain and other countries. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Today's "Kokumin Shimbun" reported that Tokyo has received news that Britain is about to dispatch military, naval, and air force delegations to Portugal so that the two countries can form a joint action in the event of war. Macau is one of the main military and dangerous locations in Portuguese territory, so Britain is currently negotiating with Portugal to establish a British naval and air force base there. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>[London] After the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway in China was bombed by Japanese planes, traffic between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland was often interrupted. Hong Kong's commerce is in danger of complete stagnation, and British business people are deeply disturbed by this. It is reported that they have joined with financial circles to put pressure on the cabinet, hoping to protect trade between China and Britain so that it will not collapse. In addition, since Hong Kong's position is currently under threat, there have been rumors that the British Far East Fleet will concentrate in Singapore. Regarding this level, British naval experts all believe that if this matter is to be implemented, it must be with the cooperation of other countries, especially the navies of the United States and the Netherlands. Speaking of the Netherlands, the waters of its East Indies currently have 20 submarines, which are very powerful in terms of defense. Although it is not known whether Britain and the Netherlands have conducted consultations on naval cooperation, it is generally believed that it is not impossible. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>[London] Today's "Manchester Guardian" mentioned the Japanese pressure on France to close the Vietnamese border, saying that France has quickly realized the danger lurking in this unconcealed threat. The aviation organization spread throughout France and North Africa will be expanded to Vietnam. Although Vietnam has a permanently stationed fleet, Britain and France will equally welcome the strengthening of aviation defenses. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Busy Visiting Central and Eastern Europe</h3>
<p>Stopping in Berlin on the Way to Warsaw, Having Long Talks with the German Foreign Minister</p>
<p>[Paris] After returning from London yesterday, Foreign Minister Delbos set off today for official visits to Poland and the Little Entente countries. It is reported that the Foreign Minister's trip was originally a gesture of appeasement to the allied countries, but after the talks between the British and French authorities, the British government entrusted Foreign Minister Delbos to speak on behalf of the British government at the same time when visiting these countries. Therefore, the significance of the Foreign Minister's trip has changed by itself. It is generally believed that with regard to maintaining the territorial integrity of the Central European countries, Delbos will provide practical guarantees to the countries concerned and inform them that Britain and France both believe that if internal disturbances occur in Austria and Czechoslovakia, they will be enough to hinder European peace. However, Delbos has no intention of conducting formal negotiations with the Central European countries, but will only exchange views with them separately on a broad basis. As for the obligations stipulated in the existing alliance treaties between France and the countries concerned, they will still be observed without exception. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The train that the French Foreign Minister Delbos was traveling on to the Polish capital passed through here this morning. German Foreign Minister Neurath immediately boarded the train to welcome him and hold talks. French Ambassador to Germany Ponset was also present. Ponset then accompanied Delbos to the city of Frankfurt. It is generally believed that the German Foreign Minister's courtesy to Delbos is extremely important. Previously, when the late French Foreign Minister Barthou visited Central Europe via Berlin in 1934, the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs only sent the Director of Protocol to take care of him at the station. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Warsaw Regarding the French Foreign Minister's visit, the newspapers here have recently commented on it, and all believe that it is of great importance. The government-sponsored "Polish Post" stated, "There is no doubt that as a result of Foreign Minister Delbos's trip, the diplomatic authorities of France and Poland will be able to reach a complete understanding." The government-sponsored "Morning Post" stated, "The cooperative relationship between France and Poland has been strengthened in the past year. Delbos's trip is enough to prove that this relationship has become increasingly close." The military organ "Polish Army News" stated, "The alliance treaty between France and Poland is becoming increasingly important to peace and security. The French Foreign Minister's visit can be seen as such." The Socialist Party's "Workers' News" stated, "Germany's policy is to weaken France's position in Central and Eastern Europe. This policy is very dangerous for Poland. It would be unwise for us to cooperate with Germany." The opposition organ "Warsaw Post" stated, "Foreign Minister Delbos's trip can confirm that France and Poland hold completely consistent views, but the two sides may not be able to agree on methods and strategies, and efforts should be made to adjust them." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Italy Currently Has the Most Submarines</h3>
<p>Ranked First in the World</p>
<p>[Paris] According to the Paris Evening News, the position of the world's leading submarine power has been transferred from France to Italy. According to official statistics, France had 89 submarines on July 1 this year, while Italy had 116. Of France's 89, only 77 are working, and the remaining 12 are six under construction and six planned. Of Italy's 116, 84 are working, and the remaining 32 are being repaired in the shipyard. The newspaper said that the French government cut the naval expenditure in the 1938 budget by 200 million francs compared with last year, and it is a miscalculation not to think about maintaining France's advantage in submarines. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<h3>French Military Budget for Next Year</h3>
<p>Totaling 5 Billion Francs, Passed by the Chamber of Deputies Yesterday</p>
<p>[Paris] This morning, the Chamber of Deputies convened to discuss the draft budget for next year. The item concerning military expenditure was unanimously passed. The total military expenditure is estimated at 5,072,000,000-odd francs, plus 1,556,000,000-odd francs for colonial defense expenditure, and 1,122,000,000-odd francs for the manufacture of gunpowder and gunpowder factories. During the discussion of this item, Minister of National Defense Daladier attended and delivered a speech, stating: "It is deeply regrettable that we have to burden the people with huge expenses to ensure the security of France's national defense. In short, it is not yet time to reduce military expenditure. There are two reasons for this: first, all attempts to reduce armaments have failed; second, Germany has a standing army of one million men, and Italy's main army also reaches 300,000 men, not including those stationed in Libyan Africa, Abyssinia, and Spain. As for France's military industry, since it was nationalized, it has been quite satisfactory. The manufacturing of anti-aircraft guns can now be done without delay. In addition, Belgium has adopted a neutral stance, so France has no choice but to protect its northern border. The defense projects on the northern Jura Mountains and Upper Alsace borders are currently under construction. Recent incidents on the Tunisian border have made it even more necessary for us to strengthen our military strength. In short, maintaining peace, preserving the republican government and the system of freedom, and preserving human dignity are the important tasks we shoulder. However, we must have sound finances," and so on. (Havas Dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3>North China Daily News Reports Eyewitness Account of Our Aircraft Attacking Japanese Warships</h3>
<p>First Air Raid in Six Weeks; Japanese Warships Fired Anti-Aircraft Guns Twice</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that yesterday (2nd) at dawn, two Chinese aircraft suddenly appeared over the mouth of Wusong, bombing Japanese warships. This was the first Chinese aircraft air raid on Shanghai in six weeks. For two weeks before the end of the fighting near Shanghai, there was no sound of anti-aircraft guns fired by Japanese warships at attacking aircraft. Yesterday morning, the Japanese warships anchored outside Wusong opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, and about twenty Japanese aircraft took off to pursue. The two Chinese single-engine aircraft, flying very fast, rumbled through the sky, but only a few people heard them. Most Shanghai residents were unaware of this action, but several foreigners witnessed it. One of them was Mr. Clarenburg of the Java Mail Steamship Company, who witnessed the whole process on his way to the Tegeeselendari, a ship of the Java Mail line, which was berthed at the Holt Wharf in Pudong. He told a reporter of the North China Daily News that he saw two aircraft flying very fast. When they reached Wusong, the Japanese warships anchored there opened fire with anti-aircraft guns. He estimated that the two aircraft were about five or six thousand feet above the ground. When they reached their target, they swooped down. He heard an explosion, and in a moment, about twenty Japanese aircraft took off to pursue, but the two Chinese aircraft had disappeared. It is now believed that Chinese aircraft made a second attack in the afternoon, as the Japanese warships' anti-aircraft guns were heard again. Yesterday afternoon, a Japanese naval spokesman told reporters that two Chinese aircraft flew to Wusong in the morning. One of them dropped a bomb near the Izumo. Several other bombs fell into the river near Wusong. According to Chinese sources, the Chinese air force has been very active in the Yangtze River area in recent days, damaging several Japanese warships. Yesterday morning, two aircraft were sent to bomb Japanese gunboats in Wusong. As for the results of the attack, all sectors of the Chinese community were unaware of it yesterday.</p>
<h3>American News Agency Reports Kawagoe's Telegram to Wang</h3>
<p>To Go to Hankou to Discuss Peace Terms; Japanese Embassy Denies This</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that a major American news agency is disseminating news in the United States that the Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe, telegraphed the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Chonghui, saying that he was willing to go to Hankou. Last night (2nd), a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy denied this, calling it a joke. According to the telegram, which was sent from Hankou on November 29, the Japanese Ambassador said that he was willing to go to Hankou to discuss peace terms, but Wang Chonghui refused, declaring that China intends to resist to the end.</p>
<h3>Japanese Boats Search Ships in Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Detaining More Than Ten Chinese Ships; Sandboats and Freighters Spared</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that yesterday (2nd) at noon, four more motorboats, of the type used for taking passengers to Wusong, and a small steamer, full of armed Japanese soldiers, arrived outside the Bund and began searching the ships, patrolling around the docks. They carefully inspected the small steamers and sandboats that were not flying foreign flags. Some of the ships were boarded by Japanese soldiers. Several ships, as many as six or seven berthing at the docks, dispersed as soon as they saw the Japanese ships coming and going. Several sandboats and freighters safely sailed away from the docks without being stopped. The Japanese soldiers' search seemed to be directed from a motorboat, on which sat an officer holding a list. The search ended at around 4 PM. Between twelve and fifteen ships were detained, including several coal boats and a small steamer. At the time, there was a large crowd of onlookers on the shore.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Detains German Tugboat, Raises Flag and Returns It</h3>
<p>Amicable Solution Reached</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that an amicable solution has been reached by the German and Japanese authorities in Shanghai regarding the two German tugboats detained by the Japanese army on November 17. On Thursday morning, in the presence of the German Consul-General, the Japanese Embassy, representatives of the Japanese China Sea Fleet, and the owners of the ships, the German flag was raised on the two ships and they were returned to their original owners.</p>
<h3>National Jinan University Actively Prepares to Move to Jiangxi</h3>
<p>校址已勘定在南昌</p>
<p>National Jinan University is the highest academic research institution for overseas Chinese. Since the Battle of Shanghai, the school has been repeatedly bombed due to its proximity to the war zone, and has suffered heavy losses. Fortunately, important instruments, books, and students have been moved to safe places in advance, so it can continue to open for classes in the Shanghai concession for the time being. Later, President He, in order to establish a permanent foundation for the school, went to Nanjing last month with University Secretary Du Zuozhou to report on the situation of the Shanghai school and to request instructions on the relocation of the school. Minister Wang discussed the matter and said that the school could select a location in the suburbs of Nanchang to move to, so that it could be permanently operated in Jiangxi. Minister Wang also said that since the school has already opened in the Shanghai concession this semester, it can be closed at the end of the next semester. After receiving the order, President He returned to Shanghai and completed the preparations for school affairs. Then he went to Jiangxi with Du Zuozhou to consult with the Jiangxi Provincial Government on the location of the school buildings. Chairman Xiong of Jiangxi Province, Acting Chairman Cheng, Director of the Department of Education, and various committee members all said that the province has been working hard to establish a national university in recent years in order to improve the province's culture and reduce the tuition costs for students. Although the Central Government has already approved the establishment of Zhongzheng Medical College, it will still need to be expanded in the future. Recently, it has been heard that Director Cheng of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, Commissioner Xiong Sui, and He Du have been personally selecting a school site in the vicinity of Nanchang City. It is generally believed that the Wanshou Palace in Xishan, sixty miles from Nanchang City, and the Zhang Family Mansion in Chitian, ninety miles away, have very spacious buildings and the scenery is quite beautiful. If they are slightly repaired, they will be ideal temporary school buildings. It was immediately decided that all the buildings in Wanshou Palace would be used for the university headquarters, and the buildings in Chitian would be used for the attached middle school. Recently, it has been heard that the school has sent a letter to the Jiangxi Provincial Government requesting permission to borrow the buildings, and it has been approved. Currently, President He has reported the selected school buildings and preparations to the Ministry of Education for filing, and has telegraphed his colleagues in Shanghai to prepare for the relocation. In order to actively prepare, the school has borrowed a building in the Relief Committee at No. 24 Qingjie Hall in Nanchang City as the Nanchang office, and President He has entrusted University Secretary Du Zuozhou as the director of the office to be responsible for all matters in Jiangxi. According to Du, the two buildings are being renovated and should be ready for use next semester. It is also learned that when Chen Panzao, a counselor from the Ministry of Education, went to Jiangxi to inspect the two temporary school buildings selected by the school, he was accompanied by Cheng Tingzhang of the Jiangxi Department of Education and He Duer for a re-examination. Chen was also satisfied and promised to return to the ministry to submit a report to Minister Chen for verification.</p>

<h3>Nanshi a Scorched Earth</h3>
<p>Ruined Walls and Frozen Wasteland; Red Timber in East Street All Reduced to Ashes; Fire Extinguished Yesterday</p>
<p>The fires in Nanshi have been continuous, but by yesterday, they had been completely extinguished, with no more signs of rekindling. Although small wisps of yellow smoke were coming from between Shipin Lane and Wengjia Lane in the city, they were just thin strands and had extinguished themselves by the afternoon. Counting from the time the fire started in Nanshi, it has been twenty-two days. Everywhere is rubble and ashes, ruined walls, a scorched earth, and a frozen wasteland. Only the areas around the refugee camps and the area from Xieqiao Zhaozhou Road to Nanyang Bridge and Heping Road are still intact, but the doors are all half-open and half-closed. The rest, along the shore and inside, has mostly changed color. Looking back on the past, it is impossible not to feel the contrast between then and now. All factories, schools, public buildings, etc., have been reduced to ashes. The extent of the loss is beyond words. Nanshi, which was once famous for its prosperity, has now become a desolate place.</p>
<p>Losses in East Street: Since the fire started in Nanshi the night before, it spread to East Street and Xueqian Street, which are close to the refugee camps. From 6 PM in the evening until 3 AM yesterday morning, it burned until it was extinguished. At that time, the people in the refugee camps could witness the tragic burning. It was found that there were many furniture stores on East Street, including Cai Hongda, Cai Hongtai, and other mahogany furniture stores. They had not moved since the war. The losses of the more than ten furniture stores in that area alone are estimated to be over two to three hundred thousand. As for the houses, there are about two to three hundred of them. However, the Qiu Tianbao Silver Shop was unharmed because its front door was at the intersection of Minguo Road.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Disaster Area: The large fire in Nanshi has now been determined to have destroyed all the houses from Xiexu Road all the way to Laoyingpan in Rihui Port. On Liyuan Road, along the street in Liyuanfang, and over fifty houses in Minli Lane in Xieqiao, only ten or so remain. Lianfang Lane on Liyuan Road was also completely destroyed. From the Tongfa Rice Store in the southern corner of Lishi West Lane to the entire RenShou Lane, HuiNing Road, and HuaiRen Lane, more than forty houses were destroyed. The houses on the west side of the Civil Court, on Tingxi Road, and the family industrial society were bombed. The houses on the north side of the coal ash road west of HuMin Road, from Scissor Bridge to Railway Station Road, destroyed the home for the disabled. It then spread to the Jixian Teahouse at the corner of the Civil Court entrance and was burned down. The houses on both sides of the Civil Court Iron Gate West Local Office Road were completely destroyed. More than ten houses in Puyi Lane and Houtai behind the Civil Court were destroyed, and the front doors are still intact. The street-facing houses and Mingfu Lane from the National Goods Road of the HuMin Long-Distance Bus Station to South Desheng Lane were all destroyed (This was bombed, and there is a huge hole in the road). The Lishi vegetable market on Daxing Street was destroyed. The houses in Lishi East Lane were burned to half of the Da Shun Xin South Goods Store. The Xinxingchi Bathhouse at the corner of Lujiabang Road diagonally opposite was destroyed, and the houses in Xichang Lane were also destroyed. All the way north, it burned to Jiangyin Street, all the way to Huangjiaque Road, Anlan Road, and Ningkang Lane. The Wuben Girls' School, Ping'an Village, and Shuzai Lane were all burned, but not completely. Dozens of houses were destroyed at the intersection of Daji Road and Linyin Road. The Zhonghua Vocational School and the Zhonghua Iron Factory on Yingxun Road, Lujiabang, were completely destroyed. Dozens of houses on Yingxun Road to Zhonghua Road were destroyed. Half of Minli Middle School was burned. Inside Xiaoximen, Shangwen Road was burned from the station to the former County Education Bureau Lane. However, to the east of Yinggong Ancestral Hall Road, except for the Longmen Village Hua House, which is currently occupied by military officers and has not been touched, the houses beyond this point have been burned all the way through Hejia Lane to Xuejia Bridge and Ninghe Road, and the Yiyuan Garden has also been burned. The garden was originally the site of the Land Bureau, and now there are the Municipal Farmers' Association and the Municipal Public Works Bureau street lamp management office, as well as the Land Administration Bureau's surveying teams 1, 2, and 3 offices and the Finance Bureau's field tax collection office. They have all been reduced to ashes, and the Penglai market has also been burned. The Penglai Road houses of the Municipal Police Bureau have been burned less, and many of the houses along the road in Xincheng Lane on Xicang Road have been burned.</p>
<h3>Four Batches of Tribute Rice Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Ship Imported 30,000 Bags of Rice Yesterday; Unloading and Distribution by Rice Industry Association This Morning; Grocers Ordered 20,000 Bags of Rice Expected to Arrive Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company are cooperating to purchase foreign rice. The fourth batch, loaded on the Zhejiang ship, arrived in Shanghai at 4 PM yesterday. The grocers ordered the first batch of 20,000 bags of Annam rice, loaded on the Shunzhi ship. Due to winds along the coast, it has been delayed until today to arrive in Shanghai. The Rice Industry Association is handling the distribution of the four batches of rice. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhejiang Arrives in Shanghai: The French firm Daufou, entrusted by the Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company, ordered a total of 115,000 bags of Saigon foreign rice, which will be shipped to Shanghai in four batches. The fourth batch of 30,000 bags, loaded on the British Taikoo Company's Zhejiang ship, arrived in Shanghai at 4 PM yesterday and berthed at the Taikoo Wharf pontoon. The foreign firm plans to unload the goods at the Bund Wharf on Sanma Road this morning for the Rice Industry Association to pick up and distribute to 500 member rice stores for retail.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Orders: The grocery industry association member rice shops ordered foreign rice from Annam. The first batch was loaded on the British ship Shunzhi, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 1st. Due to bad weather along the coast, it has been delayed repeatedly. It is now expected to arrive in Shanghai today, with a volume of 2,000 tons, equivalent to 20,000 bags. As for the rice loaded on the French Postal Steamship Lilo, it was ordered by French firms such as Daufou and is expected to arrive on the afternoon of the 13th. In addition, the second batch of Annam rice for the grocery industry is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Contacting for Rice Collection: In addition to collecting Saigon rice from the Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company in four batches, totaling 80,000 bags, which will be distributed to 500 member rice stores for retail, each member rice store has also directly asked the association to forward a certificate to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and has been trying to purchase domestic rice from rice-producing areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Chairman Zhang Nianxuan of the association has been in contact with the French Concession Board and the grocery industry to continue collecting rice and handling retail matters.</p>
<h3>Two Associations Procure Rice, Beans, Firewood, and Charcoal</h3>
<p>Ordering Rice and Beans from Nantong; Procuring Firewood and Charcoal from Wenzhou</p>
<p>Ordering Rice and Beans: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Nantong Martial Law Headquarters yesterday, certifying that the city's grocers were transporting rice and beans. The original letter stated, "Dear Sir, According to a letter from the city's Groceries, Oils, and Cake Industry Association, the city is lacking rice and the people's food supply is in danger. Our firm plans to purchase rice and beans from Nantongzhou Taixian to provide some relief. In addition to obtaining a certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, please ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to prepare another document to the Nantong Martial Law Headquarters, approving the release, so that our firm can send personnel to Tong to deliver it for procurement, and we will be very grateful," which was received. The Shanghai food supply is lacking and needs to be relieved. The company is sending personnel to Tong to transport rice and beans, which is for the purpose of relieving the people's food supply. In addition to issuing a certificate from our association, we hereby send a letter to your department, requesting that you order your subordinates to release it at that time, which is our greatest expectation."</p>
<p>Procuring Firewood and Charcoal: The city's Firewood and Charcoal Industry Association believes that the city is lacking firewood and charcoal fuel, which affects the livelihood of the citizens. There is widespread panic, and they have been planning for relief. Previously, there were still many firewood and charcoal boats gathered at the Nanshi Water Plant entrance. They requested assistance from the two concession authorities to allow them to unload their goods for the market to alleviate the immediate crisis. However, this has not been done. Recently, they have repeatedly received requests from member companies to try to procure firewood and charcoal from Wenzhou. At the same time, many Wenzhou merchants have also come to Shanghai a few days ago to discuss the restoration of supply methods. The association, in addition to requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to first send a letter to the local government to provide a certificate, also convened an emergency meeting of all member companies yesterday to discuss procurement of firewood and charcoal and market regulation methods. After the Wenzhou guests explained the situation, it was resolved that each member company would separately identify the goods, and in the first phase, raise 40,000 yuan in funds, which would be collected by the Zhejiang Industry and the Zhongnan banks. After obtaining a certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, they would immediately send personnel to join the Wenzhou guests to purchase the goods.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Investigates and Reports Factory Losses</h3>
<p>First Batch of 1.5 Million Yuan; The Rest Awaiting Completion and Submission</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Industry, reporting that on November 23, it had approved the Shanghai Municipal Government Secretariat's dispatch to the Ministry of Industry to investigate industrial losses in various places, and attached blank forms to the meeting. According to the Huamei Tobacco Company and other seven companies, they have filled out the forms and submitted them to the meeting, which are included in the first batch and telegraphed for verification. The details are as follows: ㊀ Huamei Tobacco Company factory loss of 590,000 yuan, ㊁ Yonghe Industrial Company loss of 390,000 yuan, ㊂ New China Engineering Co., Ltd. loss of 129,524 yuan, ㊃ Xinfeng Silk and Cloth Factory loss of 81,592 yuan, ㊄ Yufeng Silk Factory loss of 89,300 yuan, ㊅ Shude Company loss of 104,500 yuan, ㊆ China Machine Printing Factory loss of 150,000 yuan. The above seven factories in the first batch total 1,534,916 yuan in losses.</p>
<h3>After the Suspension of Raw Silk Inspection, Foreign Firms Stop Purchasing Chinese Silk</h3>
<p>More Than 10,000 Bales of Silk in Shanghai; Only Three Silk Factories Operating, Including Jardine Matheson</p>
<p>The silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been affected by the war. Except for the three factories in the Shanghai Public Concession, Jardine Matheson and others, the rest have temporarily suspended operations. After the suspension of raw silk export inspection, the foreign firms stationed in Shanghai have stopped purchasing Chinese silk, resulting in a surplus of silk in Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Silk Factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Have Almost All Stopped Operations: Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are our country's silk producing areas. According to statistics from 1931, there are 105 in Shanghai, 6 in Suzhou and Zhenjiang, 48 in Wuxi, 14 in Hangzhou, 4 in Jiaxing, and 5 in Huzhou, Xiashi, and Changan, for a total of 185, with 48,120 machines. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the areas of the silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have all become war zones. Except for the three factories in the Shanghai Public Concession, Tong Yuhongfeng north of the Suzhou Creek and Jardine Matheson and others south of the Suzhou Creek, the rest have all stopped operations, and more than 100,000 unemployed male and female workers are out of work.</p>
<p>Inspection Suspended, Foreign Firms Stop Trading: The sales channels for our country's factory silk are divided into ㊀ overseas European and American markets and ㊁ domestic silk factory users. Today, the European and American markets are affected by the Far East War, and the sales of Chinese silk have been greatly reduced. The domestic silk factories are affected by the Shanghai War and cannot start operations. At the same time, because the raw silk export inspection of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has been suspended, foreign firms operating in Chinese silk exports stationed in Shanghai, such as Dachan and Lena, have temporarily suspended the purchase of Chinese silk.</p>
<p>Silk Prices Have No Market, Inventory Piles Up: After the foreign firms stopped purchasing Chinese silk and the domestic silk factories were forced to stop operations, there was no transaction in factory silk at all, and prices were no longer available. Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been trying to transport the reeled silk to warehouses in safe areas of Shanghai for storage, resulting in a pile of silk in Shanghai. Reporters have learned from silk factories that the total is more than 10,000 bales, with Wuxi silk accounting for the majority.</p>
<p>Cocoons Stored in Various Places Cannot Be Reeled: The silk merchants and cocoon merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have a large number of spring and autumn cocoons in storage. Now, because the silk factories in various places have been forced to stop operations, they cannot be reeled. This year, the Zhejiang Sericulture Control Association borrowed money and entrusted the factories to purchase autumn cocoons. Except for a small number that have been reeled into factory silk and transported to Shanghai for the Sales Promotion Committee to promote overseas sales, most are stored in warehouses in Hangzhou and other places.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Factory Industry Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Coal Dust Source Extremely Scarce, Coal Briquette Quality Poor</p>
<p>Coal briquettes, due to their convenient combustion and low price, are the most common fuel for daily use by citizens. Therefore, the coal briquette industry in this city is particularly developed. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency at the Coal Briquette Industry Association, since the outbreak of war in this city, all industries have suffered losses, and the coal briquette factory industry has been particularly severe. Among the large-scale manufacturers in the concessions, only Oriental is still operating. In Zhabei, there were Hua Nan, and in Nanshi, there were Nan Yang, Guo Hua, Zhong Hua, and He Zhong, a total of four factories. In the Hongkou district, there were Da Zhong Yuan, Guang Hua, and Zhong Guo, three factories. In the Yangshupu district, there were Hua Cheng and Hua Dong, two factories. None of them moved out after the war. Currently, most of the factory buildings and machinery have been reduced to ashes, resulting in extremely heavy losses. According to the person in charge of the industry, currently only Oriental is still in operation, but even they are operating intermittently due to a lack of raw materials. Most others are using small machinery and hiring laborers for manual production, resulting in a sharp decrease in output. According to investigations, current products are no longer as refined and durable as in the past. Previously, coal briquettes were made with approximately 80% coal dust and 20% mud dust, but now, due to the extreme scarcity of coal dust, this standard can no longer be maintained. The raw materials for coal briquettes used to rely on Li Hua dust and Fu Yuan dust from the Yangtze River basin, as well as Hong Ji coal dust from overseas. Now, the Yangtze River route has been cut off, and the supply of Hong Ji goods is also weak, resulting in a continuous increase in prices. Before the war, each ton cost 18 yuan, but now it has reached more than 50 yuan, which poses a serious threat to the daily lives of citizens.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Water Transportation</h3>
<p>New Beijing Resumes Sailing to Ningbo, Liverpool First Time Through</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Line: The Ningbo River blockade was coordinated by the Ningbo Fellow Association with the Ningbo authorities to allow foreign merchant ships from Shanghai to enter the port. However, the fortress department must send a ship to guide the port. Therefore, the Italian merchant ship De Ping is now resuming its regular voyages, traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo every other day, which is convenient for travelers. According to a report from the Da Tong News Agency yesterday, the Taikoo's New Beijing has also resumed the Shanghai-Ningbo line and has already started a trip. The second trip is scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Ningbo at 2:00 PM on the 4th, and then to Wenzhou. The third-class ticket from Shanghai to Ningbo on this ship used to be three yuan, but now, in order to reduce the burden on passengers, it has been reduced to two yuan, the same price as the De Ping.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Nantong Line: The Shanghai-Nantongzhou route is the only transportation route after the change of the war situation. After the ships on this line arrive in Tongzhou, both cargo and passengers can take a boat to Zhenjiang, then to Nanjing, and then to various ports along the Yangtze River to reach various cities and towns in the interior. Therefore, the British merchant Taikoo Jardine Matheson's Wuhu, Wuxue, Tonghe, and Pinghe, and the Italian merchant Hua Yi Company's En De and other five ships are experiencing unprecedented congestion in passenger and cargo transportation. Currently, in order to clear the accumulated goods in Nantong, the two companies have temporarily stopped loading cargo and are focusing on carrying passengers. Therefore, various goods in Shanghai that want to be transported to various ports along the Yangtze River have to wait for an opportunity. It is learned that the Greek merchant Da Tong Shipping Company in this city has recently decided to open the Shanghai-Nantong line to carry passengers and cargo to facilitate transportation, and has designated the Liverpool fast ship to operate. Its first sailing date is this month on the 5th (Sunday) at 8:00 AM, departing from Jin Li Yuan Wharf. Ticket sales have already begun. The third-class fare is two yuan and two yuan and five jiao, respectively.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Chongming Line: After the British merchant Taikoo Company decided to open the Shanghai-Chongming line and designated the Xiu Shan to operate, it has already started selling passenger tickets. Those who want to go to Chongming can directly purchase tickets from the company. The first sailing date of the ship has been set for 7:00 AM this morning, departing from the Taikoo Company Wharf in Puxi.</p>
<h3>Meteor and Haiguang Grain Transport Ships Still Working</h3>
<p>Currently Moored on the Huangpu River in Front of the New Customs, Will Leave Shanghai with Grain and Fodder in the Coming Days</p>
<p>After the Jianghai Customs patrol ships were seized, only the Haixing and Meteor grain transport ships were spared because they were responsible for supplying food, beverages, and oil to the lighthouse keepers on the isolated islands at sea. At the time, it was not reported that they were seized. However, soon after, when the two grain transport ships were towing the patrol ships in the Huangpu River for the second time that day, they were also towed away. However, because the supply work of the two ships was crucial, they were eventually released. When the reporter visited the Jianghai Customs yesterday morning, the two ships were both moored on the Huangpu River in front of the new customs. It was heard that they would soon be transporting grain, beverages, and oil to various lighthouses, floats, and mark trees at sea for supply. It was found that in addition to the Haixing and Meteor, the Jianghai Customs grain transport ships also have the Haixing. Because it was transferred to the Yangtze River area to take on the supply work of various lighthouses, light floats, and signposts, it did not stay in Shanghai. According to the recent announcement by the Customs Patrol Engineering Department on the current water level of various sections of the Yangtze River, which is extremely important for navigation during the shallow water season next year, the exploration records are as follows: Changsha 7 feet 9 inches, Yichang 10 feet 2 inches, Shashi 12 feet 6 inches, Yuezhou 30 feet 3 inches, Hankou 35 feet 5 inches, Jiujiang 32 feet 1 inch, Anqing 31 feet 9 inches, Wuhu 22 feet 2 inches, Zhenjiang 15 feet.</p>
<h3>Gaoqiao Residents Take Responsibility for Their Own Defense</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Once Advanced, Withdrew After Consideration, Ferry Crossing Has Hubei Qingkou Gang Demanding Expenses</p>
<p>Yesterday evening at 5:00 PM, a reporter inquired about the recent situation of Gaoqiao from villagers who came to Shanghai. According to reports, after our troops withdrew from the area, there were no Japanese troops stationed there. Last month, the Japanese side issued a notice stating that they would send a team to suppress the town. On the 30th at 8:00 AM, 70 to 80 naval marines landed at the Gaoqiao Wharf and advanced to the town, stationed in sections. The fire brigade and other groups sent representatives to negotiate with the Japanese troops, assuring them that the town was safe and there was no need to worry, and requesting them to withdraw their troops to reassure the people. They also provided them with a luncheon. After considering, the Japanese troops finally agreed. Therefore, the landing troops withdrew completely that afternoon. Currently, the town is still open for business as usual. The local residents are taking responsibility for their own defense. There have been no cases of theft. However, at the Gaoqiao ferry crossing, the Hubei Qingkou gang is guarding the area, demanding expenses from passengers carrying goods or vegetables. The amount ranges from several jiao to several yuan, and haggling is possible. However, those who refuse to pay are often in danger of losing their goods or vegetables. Therefore, passengers passing through the ferry crossing find this extremely hateful.</p>

<h3>International Relief Conference Decides to Aid Homeless Refugees</h3>
<p>Initially Increase Accommodation by 1,000, Then Plan Expansion, Salvation Army Distributes Food on Streets for Days</p>
<p>The International Relief Society held a standing committee meeting yesterday. In addition to reporting on various association affairs, it was noted that there were a large number of homeless refugees along the streets and in various neighborhoods. As the harsh winter has already arrived, it is urgent to rescue them. The following relief measures were decided: ㊀ Establish a sixth shelter specifically for homeless refugees from the streets and various neighborhoods. ㊁ Use the Jinzhuang Guild Hall on North Henan Road as the site. ㊂ Initially aim to accommodate 1,000 people, then plan for expansion. ㊃ The association will allocate 1,000 yuan for start-up expenses and prepare for establishment immediately. In addition, the Director of the Relief Group of the Society, Mr. Marius, has been working with members of the Salvation Army for days, carrying steamed buns and other foods to distribute on the streets, providing temporary relief.</p>
<p>Christmas Expansion of Disaster Relief for Children: The International Relief Society believes that the Christmas holiday is approaching soon, and most of the disaster-stricken children in the shelters are living in misery, either lacking clothing or suffering from illness. The situation is very tragic. Therefore, a "Disaster Relief for Children Movement" has been launched, hoping that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate children's necessities before Christmas, such as clothes, quilts, shoes, hats, socks, and children's books and various candies, which would be greatly welcomed, to be distributed on Christmas Day to benefit the disaster-stricken children.</p>
<p>Preventing Theft, Nighttime Guard: When the Nanshi Refugee Area was first established, theft was rampant and quite rampant. Recently, with the increasingly complete measures in the area, and the French authorities also dispatched police to patrol the area, this trend has been curbed. However, break-ins and thefts of uninhabited houses in the area still occur. The International Relief Society office issued a notice yesterday announcing nighttime guard measures, prohibiting walking on the road from 7:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning. Violators will be detained at the office and released at dawn.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief for Children to be Moved to New Site: The China Early Childhood Education Association is making unremitting efforts in disaster relief for children in the war zone. It is learned that the association's disaster relief shelter for children at the Jinye Vocational School on Da Tong Road, Baek Road, cannot be expanded. It has selected the new site of the Caojiadu St. John's YMCA Middle School and has been dispatching personnel to arrange it for days, which has been completed. In addition to merging the existing shelter immediately, it is also trying to negotiate with the concession authorities to include some of the disaster-stricken children in the refugee area. Because the new site is sufficient to accommodate more than 1,000 disaster-stricken children, the association also plans to send personnel to the Pinghan Road area to organize disaster relief work for children, which can be launched within a week.</p>
<h3>Embezzling 20,000, Whisking Away a Prostitute for Pleasure</h3>
<p>Tea Boy Facilitates Escape, Investigation Concludes with Prosecution</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongming, the executive director of the China Made Legs Company in Room 413 of the Shanghai Building at 368 Sichuan Road, ordered his staff member, Cantonese Hu Qingbin, at 9:00 AM on the 1st of this month to deliver a check for 20,000 yuan in national currency from the China Xing Bank at 149 Sichuan Road to the Cunde Qianzhuang at 316 Ningbo Road. However, Hu did not do so and instead went to the China Hostel on Zhejiang Road after cashing the 20,000 yuan to abscond. The detective department of the police station, led by Chinese detective Jiang Shangpei and detectives Zhu Wanjun and Tian Zhengsheng, launched an investigation after Zhang reported the incident to the police station. After Hu withdrew the money, he immediately went to Room 37 of the China Hostel on Zhejiang Road and hired a Cantonese prostitute, Cui Xiuying, to accompany him. Therefore, at 11:00 PM that night, the detectives went to the hostel with Hu's photo to inquire. However, the tea boy, Zhou A Lin, falsely claimed that no such person was staying there.

<p>The foreign merchant ferries that maintain temporary traffic between Pudong and Puxi, except for the Yangjing and Dongjiang lines, which have been blocked, the only remaining Gaoqiao line has also been interrupted for three days. After the British merchant Moller Company sent personnel to explain that the navigation issue had nothing to do with military affairs and made every effort to dredge it, the Gaoqiao ferry crossing was finally allowed to open yesterday. The company immediately sent a large transport Minnie at around 8:00 AM, moored at the Xin Guan Wharf on Sanma Road, carrying more than a thousand villagers and vegetable vendors. At 9:00 AM, it set sail and went directly to Gaoqiao, and at 10:30 AM, it returned with more than a thousand people. At 2:00 PM, it made another trip and returned to Shanghai at 5:00 PM. In total, there were two trips back and forth throughout the day, relieving the stranded passengers on both sides of the east and west, about 5,000 people. The ticket sales amounted to about 2,500 yuan, and the vegetables from Pudong, which had been cut off for more than three days, were also transported in large quantities in two trips in the morning and afternoon, with the most being large green vegetables, followed by celery, shepherd's purse, cabbage, spinach, cauliflower, golden flower vegetables, new garlic, taro, and so on, totaling about seven or eight hundred dan. From this morning, they will be filling the vegetable markets in this city again. When the reporter boarded the ship to Shanghai, he inquired with the Chinese crew members and learned that the ship's individual resumption of navigation was only temporary. The crew members were also unable to confirm whether it could still sail this morning and would depend on temporary decisions. As for the Italian merchant Hua Yi Company's Beiyang and the Moller Company's ships, they have not yet resumed navigation to Gaoqiao because they have not made arrangements.</p>
