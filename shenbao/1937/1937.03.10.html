<h3>對王寵惠之談話日方表示其見解</h3>
<p>認王外長聲明之趣旨　與佐藤闡明者相符合　華北問题似難卽解决</p>
<p>［東京］中國外交部長王寵惠發表之外交方針、極為抽象的、其内容不過表示互惠平等友誼等外交之根本原则、關於今後之其體方針、未有表示、故日本外務省亦以極愼重之態度、批評王部長之聲明、卽王部長聲明之趣旨、與佐藤外相在貴族院闡明“立於平等立場再檢討對華政策”之方針、完全符合、日本對其原則並無反對、母寗封於中國向國家的建設邁進之努力、以東亚友邦之資格、表示同情的態度、唯問題在於中國將如何具體化此種抽象的原則之點、當中國實現此原则時、如非由政治的立場充分認識實際的事態、而研究根基於現在事實之解决方法、則兩國當局者欲確立中日和平之努力、必招來反對的結果、並能使中日關係比今日狀態更為惡化、尤其中國方面期待之平等及互惠等、如係隨徙中國國家之完備、漸進的取消不平等條約者、則日本當局亦當然應其交涉、並有提出日本方面要求之準備、然中國之要求、如一部份人所主張、為取消華北政策及其他非現實的、且無認識之强硬者、則佐藤外相企圖使兩國關係歸於常道之努力、亦不得不歸泡影而失其功效、因此日外務省希望中國充分諒解佐藤外相之眞意、由大局见地實行外交方針、而不誤其進退也、（九日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］佐藤外相在貴族院演說外交方針時、中國新任外交部長王寵惠亦在南京發表外交方針、唯王部長之聲明、比佐藤外相之詳細答辯、過於抽象的、且屬簡單、故對於日本國民與以意外感念、王部長之聲明、確以日本為其對象、可解釋為對於林兼攝外相外交演說、及佐藤外相親任式後聲明之應聲、綜合日本各方面之意見、王部長最先主張兩國國民感情之融合、其次力說尊重主權、以平等互惠爲基礎解决外交諸問題、此焉當然之外交的言論、而其精神亦與佐藤外相八日之外交演說精神合致，要在此兩者今後處理具體的問題時、如何誠實、且如何现實的實行其方針之一點、總之中日兩國新外相、同時發表同樣精神之言論，主張互相提携、努力安定東亞、则由此空氣之中發見經濟的與政治的合作方法、當然爲此兩當局者之責任、然若就保全領士一项而論、中國方面如照其理想、卽時要求解消冀東與冀察政府、或出於否認中日“满”三國接壤地特殊性之態度、则不論兩國外相之言論如何巧妙、其不過終於言論而已、故豫料王部長将来不拘泥於此種抽象的理想論、必能洞察大局、努力實行實際的政策、（九日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］今晨此間各報均以最重要之地位刋載我新任外長王寵惠氏對外國新聞記者所發表之談話、朝日新聞在新聞欄内著論稱王寵惠氏之談話以林銑十郎前在議會所發表之演說、及佐藤尙武就任外相後所發表之談話爲對象當爲封日本之一種重要姿势、中國外長凖備從事調整中日關係、誠含有重要意義、佐藤在贵族院宣佈同樣態度後、王氏卽發表談話、相隔僅數小時、王氏措辭雖屬抽象、但在兩國之外交姿態上、業已發現新途徑及意見相符之點、今兩氏就任兩國外長、並相互承認彼此之立場、则新局勢已在發展中、而可共同實現東亞之安定也、該報機顯示外務省之態度、認爲在現時空氣之下、應覓求經濟政治合作之各種具體計畫、誠屬自然、惟關於維持領土主權一點、苟中國堅持撤廢冀東僞組織時、日本仍不得不採取斷然態度、故中國如完全認識日本之眞實意向、則中國必须以巧妙之法應付局勢云、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>［東京］日外相佐藤尙武昨日在貴族院所發表之演說、雖無原稿、但演詞之大意、似均已獲得首相林銑十郎，陸相杉山元、及海相米内光政之同意、大河内之質問、亦似係事前商妥、以予佐藤發表該演詞之機會、據此間所悉、各國之反響極佳、蘇聯認爲係日本對華之新措施、惟觀諸此間權威方面之心理、封於佐藤之抽象的談話、僅在闡明原則一點雖未表示反對、但於具體問題，奴撤廢冀東僞組織、及交還察北六縣等、不獨已發現反對之意見、甚至有人竟表示强硬意見、故事實上旣存之許多難題、不能僅談原則而可解决也、佐藤胸中所懷解决具體問題之計劃、现雖未悉、但如中國之立場不予以適當之尊重、以及佐藤不能設法予以合理之解决、則原則之討論、恐終成爲空談也、惟此間空氣已大見轉變、凡關心中日問題人士、均殷待佐藤將其所言演成理實、及将中日關係恢復正常途徑云、（九日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>佐藤外交的剖視</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>從西安事變和平解决以後。日本對華的觀感頗有相當的改變。如日本前任駐南京總領事須磨最近回國後盛稱吾國之強盛。謂如日之方升又如卽將來華之日本考察團團長兒玉也力主要以新的眼光來看中國七日日本新任外相佐藤在議會中的外交演說。更為九一八事變以來所罕見。佐藤在其演說中雖謂一國之外交應有其繼續性。但與現局不適宜者亦應設法予以改變在佐藤的眼光中。日本以前的對華外交確有其不能適應新局勢發展的地方因此他說“中日問題只有吾儕改變方法另從新起點着手。方可解决”佐藤所說的新起點是什麼呢。主要的是以平等的地位對待中國進行談判佐藤說。“完全獨立國家間的交涉應以平等的地位為根據。”又說“吾入應將過去一切付諸東流而從新以平等地位進行談判。”佐藤外相的這次演。的確是幣以以後不會聽到過。而值得我們密切注意的。</p>
<p>不過我們在聆蝗日本新外相的演說之後不能不指出佐藤所要求改變的。是日本對華交涉的方法而不是日本對華外交的根本政策。日本對華外交的根本政策是大陸政策的厲行。這個大陸政策除非過到極大的阻碍。是不會改變或放棄的。佐藤所說的“一國的外交應有其機續性。”也就是指這點而言所以佐藤新外相所主張改變的。是對華談判的方法。這種談判方法的改變也許可以解决兩國間的若干問題。但其所求達到的目的卻沒有兩樣。這是我們應該明白的。</p>
<p>佐藤外相為什麼主張改變對華的態度呢。這有兩個重要的原因。第一是中國的統一局面已日趨鞏固。各黨各派都在中央政府的抵抗外來侵略的大目標下凝結在一起。匯成巨大的勢力使日本再不能像以前一樣的予取予求。尤其是去年兩廣事件與西安事變的和平解决。使日本不能再以“非現代的國家”來看待我國至於綏遠抗戰的勝利與南京中日談判的僵持更使日本不能不考慮改變其過去的政策。第二是日本近年厲行大陸政策的結果。已引起國際間的嚴重反擊。而陷於國際孤立的地位中。去年日德反共協定的締訂。本想藉此打開這種孤立的局面。但結果適得其反。非但全世界各國都注目這個協定就是日本國內的人民也極表不滿。羣起攻擊政府。在這樣國際孤立的局面下。日本政府就不能不改變其過去的對華態度了。因為誠如新外相所說。“中日問題的根本解决乃日本將來外交的樞紐對華關係調整之成敗。不僅可予日本對蘇聯關係以嚴重的影響。且對英美亦有關係。至於所謂太平洋問題與軍縮問題。均與對華問題不可分離。倘中日問題能予以調整。則日本與其他列強之磨擦。自可大為減少。同時日本之信譽亦可提高。”（見七日佐藤對記者談話）</p>
<p>在上述二個原因中。前者比後者更為重要。因為吾國統一局勢的鞏固。對日能採保持主權完整的堅強政策。則日本就不至於提出過分要求。而大陸政策亦無法順利實現。因此日本與各國在遠東利益的衝突也不至於如此嚴重。所以我們如果要希望日本能改變過去的對華態度。那末我們首要擁護中央政權。鞏固統一局面。對外採取一個獨立國家所應具的堅強政策。如果不此之圖。而對佐藤外交懷着奢望。那是會上當的。因為要中他們真有改變對華外交的决心。以平等的國家對待我們。那未就該尊重中國主權與領士的完整。首先取消華北的非法組織。交還東北四省。然後再來談判邦交的調整。經濟的提攜以及“共存共榮”的辦法。</p>
<h3>佐藤外交宣言郭泰祺表滿意</h3>
<p>謂中日談判僵局須予打破　英日妥協應尊重中國利益</p>
<p>［倫敦］</p>
<p>路透代表今日晋謁中國大使郭泰祺、郭大使對日本新外相佐藤在貴族院中所發表同情於中國求與他國平等之演說、表示滿意、且謂中日談判之僵局、必須有以打破之、惟談判當依平等互惠之方針、重行開始、其言曰“余覺佐藤友善之姿勢、必能引起南京正常方面之反應、王寵惠博士之任中國外長、佐藤之任日本外相、適在同日公布、此或為一種佳兆、蓋因此可便雙方、於相互之關係上、就新觀念作新起點也、佐藤之演說、其結果或將有利於、關心遠東和平與商業之各國、中國之圖與列強親善、孜孜不倦、而尤注重其近鄰、其進行此舉也、依守平等與互惠之基礎、故對此種謀友好解决之建議、必予歡迎郭大使繼述及日外相願與英國重圖親善、消除在中國市場起爭之源一節、謂渠確信中國對於此種發展、唯有表示滿意而已、至於英日之任何妥協、必將尊重中國之經濟與政治利益、自無庸贅言、郭大使末乃聲明、凡所言者、悉為其個人見解云、（中央社八日路透電）</p>
<h3>英國好感</h3>
<p>［倫敦］日本新外相佐藤昨在貴族院所發之演說、已引起此間與遠東有關各界及其他各界之良好印象、一般人士皆以為日政府今已充分覺悟其摟今對華政策之失敗、旦夕必將變更其策略、日本今似願尊重中國所提出以平等原則、為解决中日懸案新談判基礎之主張、衆又謂日本歷任外相就職時、輒發使人興奮之同樣演詞、但据現象觀之此次佐藤所發者、必得林首相與杉山元陸相之充分贊助、東京之政治空氣對於佐藤必能履行其所言一節、似確抱同一意見、再則、新任外相似將得駐華日大使川越之同情、尤憶川越大使嘗發言、主張重整日本之對華政策、而與中日經濟關係有關之非官場有擊力各界之代表亦嘗表示同樣意見、英國運用友善外交、以成立中英間和諧之合作、於近數月中在南華所表現者、日人對之顯心深切有感於中云、（中央社九日路透電）</p>
<h3>美取保留</h3>
<p>［華盛頓］日本新外相佐藤發表關於外交政策宣言之後、美國政界人士均以保留態度處之、並謂佐藤外相主張改善中日兩國關係、此項政策、美國政府自所贊成、惟日本熊度轉變之眞意、恐在鞏固日德兩國間之諒解、其主要目的、似為消除日本與中國作戰之危險、並使中國在未來日俄兩國戰事中、保守中立、此在美國外交界人士亦謂中國、政府此際正擬造成全國大團結、藉以抵抗日本之威脅故日本乃乘機向中國提議訂立新友好條約、俾使中國不受莫斯科之影響云、（中央社八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>東報評論</h3>
<p>［東京］外相佐藤昨在貴族院發表關於外交政策演說後、今晨僅朝日新聞讀賣新聞與都新聞三報加以評論、關於對華外交一點、期日新聞謂、外相佐藤關於對華外交之觀點、在原則上不應反對、佐藤曾斷言日本過去數年間之對華外交、結果已完全失敗、此類確言山諸外交當局之口、可謂罕見的率直之自承也、不幸此項斷言、不僅不應加以否認、但從吾人觀點上、且有疑問、卽日本在過去數年間是否曾有澈底對華之外交、目前僵局之主要原因、實由於日本自始至終在對華外交上堅持自己狹窄之觀點、而忽視向國際關係之立場觀察全般局勢之需要、吾人曾屢次言明、中日關係之調整、乃日本整個外交政策之基石、因此非與對華關心之各國合作、不能預期成功、佐藤懷抱國際外交上之可貴經驗、對從新起點重行檢討中日問題之工作實屬最適宜之人物也、讀賣新聞評論謂、外相佐藤所謂從新起點、改變看法、以及將過去一切付諸東流、準備以平等地位恢復談判數語、應視為較林首相前在議會所言、卽兩國國民應時相接觸、俾實質上增進中日之接近與互助為更進一步、不期中國外交部長王寵惠氏亦於同日向記者宣稱、國際關係應以平等互惠為基礎、循和平路綫力謀友誼之增進、此言誠良好之對照也、中日兩外相同時重行指出與再度宣佈在平等互惠原則下增進友誼之斷言、使否人豁然為之一爽、如呼吸新鮮空氣焉、但僅如此不應視作充分之保證、以判斷曾遭遇無數打擊之中日談判能得順利進行、因此吾人誠懇希望兩國當局對現局之眞實情形、不予忽視、不然、良好之空氣將不幸如霧之消散矣、</p>
<p>都新聞載稱、外相佐藤駐節外國為時甚久、戰是之故、對外交之連續感覺必要、雖然國內與情在决定外交途徑、誠甚重要、但對方情况亦應慎重加以考慮、在對華方面尤感必要、因中國情形複雜與微妙也、至於從新起點改變看法之意見、乃吾人一向所擁護云、（中央社九日電）</p>
<h3>日議會重心移貴族院</h3>
<p>預算案開始審議</p>
<p>［東京］貴族院自本日起開始審議政府預算案、因此議會中心移至貴族院、政府當局因預算案平安通過衆議院、抱樂觀態度、頗信貴族院方面雖有議論、結果必能通過預算、但因議會會期僅餘十七日、擬盡力促進貴族院審議預算案、而有必要時、實施最少限度會期之延長、以期預算案俾圓滿成立、（九日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］本日貴族院會議、午前十時二十五分開會、因接到衆議送交之預算案、於是重心暫移歸貴族院、議場至形緊張、傍聰席亦告滿座、劈頭由結城藏相要求發言而登臺、說明十二年度總預算案之大網、其演詞與在衆院之財政演說略同、並謂此項修正預算、業經衆議院照原案可决、但此次提出預算案較例年稍遲、在此會期短縮之際、仍望審議之後賜以贊助為荷、演說過三十五分鐘始畢、（九日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］日貴族院今日有人提出極端荒謬之質問、使人不禁啞然失笑、在今日之世界中、此種殘餘思想竟仍未消滅、殊為不解、綠有年邁之文學博士三上參次、現為貴族院議員、今日會議時、突然向外相佐藤尚武質問、謂日政府曷承認“中華民國”之慣用名稱、三上企圖解釋“中華”兩字謂、該兩字之習用表示藐視中國以外之其他國家、佐藤答曰、一九三○年內閣會議决定、在正式文件上、中國應稱為“中華民國”佐藤並謂、每個國家之國名、皆由國家自由選擇、他國實不能不加以承認、且事實上稱為“支那”、亦不足表示藐視云、三上又起立對佐藤昨日之演詞表示反對謂、中國人民過於自尊、安能與之平等云、（中央社九日電）</p>
<h3>日商相說明對滿經濟關係</h3>
<p>［東京］今日衆議院之輸出保障案委員會、伍堂商相答覆政友會宮本一郎之質問、對於日滿產業質易關係、闡明政府之方針如左、</p>
<p>㊀若僅由日本方面之便宜而論、則明訂日滿產業之分野、滿洲出為原料、日本以其原料而加工、當屬最良之辦法、但滿洲旣為嚴然之“獨立國”、則漸次舉辦加工產業、實為情出不已、日本對於此事、卽其頭痛之根源、故日本為將來計、務使勿發生不利之競爭、設法調整以日滿兩國之消費經濟為基調、其貿易政策亦須注重於此、㊁由日滿貿易之見地上觀之、理想上當以日滿經濟集團打成一片、而廢除關稅是也、但日滿特惠關稅之訂約、未便輕易行使、尚應加以考盧也、㊂滿洲市場將來不能認為不變為日華之競爭市場、但由日滿間之特殊情形觀之、斷無特別於日不利之事，蓋滿洲之新產業、均由日本之資本而成立者也、㊃為阻止在滿發生日華經濟上之競爭起見、若日滿訂立特種協定、實為不妥、實際上滿洲之產業計畫反其資金、均由日本一手造成者、若此種滿洲竟被中國所威脅、當為我國產寨之奇恥大辱、尤有言者、若將中國經濟力欲驅逐於滿洲以外、余認為不可者也云云、（九日國民電）</p>

<h3>國聯原料會議英代表陳述意見</h3>
<p>反對殖民地門戶開放　準備獎勵原料品生產　日代表力主移民自由</p>
<p>［日內瓦］國聯近召集會議研究各國對若干種原料應的平等商業機會問題、參加者十六國日本雖非國聯會員國、亦在其列、而德意兩國竟無代表山席、該會已於今日開幕、由國聯秘霄長愛文諾致開幕詞、謂川席各員非全代表其本國政府、故大可自由發表意見、會議將取非公開式、會議情形僅將摘要發表云、（中央社八日路透電）</p>
<p>嗣由英日兩國代表相繼發言、英國代表卽該國政府經濟顧問李滋羅斯爵士（卽前來中國調查財政經濟情形者）自稱所發表者、乃係個人之主張、但消息靈通人士則以為渠所陳述者、實卽英國政府之見解、李滋羅斯略謂、“今若欲轉讓各國所屬殖民地、以求解决原料問題之困難、則縱使將全洲殖民地悉行轉讓、亦未必濟事、且若干國家亦未必因此而能在原料方面自給自足也茲為解決原料問題起見、英國政府準備在其所屬各殖民地內、獎勵各項原料品之生產、卽使某種原料品僅為外國所需要、對於英國並無用處者、亦當設法增加其產額、但除此以外、英國不欲再有所作為、抑在各國殖民地內、採取門戶開放政策、往往足以妨碍殖民地事業之發展、且亦有損於土著人民之福利、今有多數國家、一方面主張門戶開放政策、而在另一方面、則又採取完全相反之政萊、例如設法妨碍國際貿易之發展、並用人為方法、維持貨幣匯價之類、何其自相予盾歟、查多數國家缺乏原料品、其故實因各該國均在國內採行不適當之財政經濟政策所致、其中尤以限制進口數額制度、最不適常、夫製造人工原料以替代天然原料、對於國民經濟所增加之負担、實較向外國購入原料為尤鉅、此類政策推行之結果、徒足使人民生活水準日益降低而已、李滋羅斯又以為國聯會秘書處所起草關於原料問題之節略內、並未提及食糧問題、殊可惋惜、則以食糧供給問題較諸工業生產品供給問題、實尤為重要也、李滋羅斯繼復主張編制關於原料品生產消費及價格之統計表、並就每種原料品各設一小組委員會、而由該原料品之主要輸入國與輸出國代表担任委員云、</p>
<p>日本代表卽該國駐德大使館商務參贊首藤繼之發表演說、大意主張廢止原枓品輸出之各種限制辦法、凡未經充分開發之各殖民地內、應一律准許移民自由入境、不問移民之國籍與種族為何、均不當加以限制、非洲此屬剛果之現行制度、在一切尚未開發之各殖民地內、均應加以倣行、首藤井又謂、貿易自由與原料品分配、此兩問題、斷不能加以分離、就日本而論、工業用原料品之供給、固屬有關日本之生存、而極為重要，然若僅用種種方法、便原料品輸入日本獲得便利、尚不足以解除當前之困難、此必同時採取各項措置、使工業製造品之國際貿易、獲得便利而和可也云、（中央社八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>倉庫紗向外運銷</p>
<p>紗市重臻佳境</p>
<p>津帮動辦現紗</p>
<p>空户抵補遂起</p>
<p>遠期人氣愈昻</p>
<p>紗市晨疲午堅、局勢不脱大盤旋之象、但多數目標觀跌、預料紗廠出數漸漸增加、逢漲時抛賣者尚不乏人、故壓力重之、昔日附和印商派其中大部份、業已由多翻空、市傳有交貨之説、二十二號定額達一萬二千包外、惟世界棉業尚在良好中、買方亦拉緊不放、現紗北路津帮採辦較勤、午後人心轉佳、市價復入佳境矣、倉庫中紗紗竭力設法使其運銷、昨則賣去一千一百餘包云、</p>
<p>標紗晨跌午漲</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月微見下落、因美棉三品紗花連漲多日、俱見回跌、然查其跌度甚爲微式、拍至遠期反見上升、二盤後近疲遠堅、迨至收盤、聞三品紗價收盤又復回漲、人心稍昂、現紗北帮仍有進胃、各月回上數角、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均跌三四角、遠漲一角、午後開盤市情傳緊、因三品紗又漲、紗銷津帮胃口續健、且倉庫中又賣去一千包外、空頭抵補又漲、三盤稍回小、迨至收盤聞現紗成交在二千包外、遠期人氣仍佳、標紗結果各月比上午收盤價均漲八九角、查賣出聚興二千四百五十包、錦昌二千五百包、大昌成四千二百包、恒益一千零五十包、裕大一千零五十包、泰昌三千七百五十包、恊成二千零五十包、大昶一千一百包、信誠一千九百五十包、買進賡豐五千六百包、明德一千八百五十包、森康五千零五十包、愼記一千包、潤康二千五百包、福康二千三百包、長豐三千六百五十包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>美印棉跌勢輕微</p>
<p>棉花看小者尚少</p>
<p>午後隨紗市回挺</p>
<p>棉市晨跌午漲、市態稍形轉趨堅昂、蓋以美棉大漲小回頭、印棉下跌亦微、因此抛賣者未見踴躍、市氣尚定、午後紗市回挺、棉市亦牽入佳境矣、但現棉廠需復趨沉寂云、</p>
<p>標花結果回起角許</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因連漲久長之美棉、反動回挫十三至十七磅音、印棉跌○二五至○五羅比、人心尚見和平、因外棉跌勢未熾、抛賣者未踴、拍至末月勿動、二盤後稍有變化、標花結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一角至二角、午後開盤、市况良好、拍至遠期更俏、以紗市復升、三品花漲力尤强空頭抵補而堅、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一角半至三角、查賣出大孚三千九百担、吉豐二千五百担、聚興一千七百担、達記一千八百担、元一六千七百担、大昌成六千八百担、益昶一千六百担、益康五千担、新昶七千一百担、源興昌九千一百担、愼昌三千三百担、泰昌六千三百担、同和二千一百担、買進恒益一萬○二百担、裕大五千五百担、通記三千七百担、明德五千五百担、合興三千六百担、瑞大二千担、豐泰二千担、賡豐一萬二千一百担、長和一萬四千五百擔、潤康五千五百擔、長豐三千擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>棉花廠辦復歸沉静</p>
<p>現棉消費平常、廠需轉趨沉悶、來源亦未見云、</p>
<p>美棉現貨脚地仍堅</p>
<p>收盤前有抵空回升</p>
<p>昨電結果跌勢尚輕</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况極活、價因利物浦消息不佳、大批多頭了結、各月猛跌二十三至三十八磅音、旋以現棉脚地堅挺、現貨商及同業盡量吸收、同時、空户亦有抵補、市價回升、收盤前、同業買進、市勢又昂、尤以遠月爲最、收盤堅穩、計現貨跌十三磅音、期貨跌十三至十八磅音、英棉現貨跌四點、期貨跌四五點、印棉初因日商大批買進及補空而漲、後因利物浦消息不佳及多頭了結而疲、計平果爾不動、奥姆辣跌○·二五至○·五羅比、白羅溪跌半羅比、原電錄左、（八日電）</p>

<p>麵粉實銷岑寂</p>
<p>昨日粉市、各月份市面、呈先疲繼漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、回好八分至一二角不等、利物浦跌一便士零、當開價時、以洋麥互有上落、市場人心、曾一度不振、故本月份開價小至四元零一分、惟有此低價、浮空急急抵補、市面復因此而回漲、二盤以下、即以空頭抵進、多頭回出不暢、本月份曾高四元零五分二厘半、其餘月份、均爲帶起二分左右、迨至下午開盤、因實銷仍鮮動静、近期人心、又逐軟弱、較上午回落一分、七八月份出入無幾、目下市情、終以實銷太寂、致難穩定云、</p>

<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源四十餘號、貨共八千四五百石、厚粳居多、厚粳店銷呆滯、行情續跌一角左右、薄稻包胃仍有天津帮辦去一千餘包、惟本銷甚淡、致市色升降不一、零去則小一角、總之薄稻出路、包胃與零銷迥然不同、客帮專視輪運之有無、彼則惟憑天時之變化、及到源之多寡、故呈參差之現象耳、杜尖帶軟羊尖乏貨已久、獨頗佔鮮、陰元則平庸、</p>
<p>新麥行市須看天時</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、大致穩定、本月份因雙方互擯、故少出入、四月份因出户甚稀、又接近本月份、因此喊高三五分、六月份以下、以客户少出、亦喊好一二分、迨至下午開盤、本月份因到頭不暢、産地合價、亦未鬆宜、故提高五分、四月份則多頭回出、回小二三分、六月份以下、大致盤旋、祗八月份人心微好、目下陳麥如到源見旺、當不致過挺、新麥如得天時緩和、人心方易漸平也、現麥市面、因廠胃不貪、喊價小去二三分、開天台麥六元六角三分、崇明麥六元五角三分、計開一千餘包云、</p>

<p>黄豆市况屹然堅昂</p>
<p>標凖油豆、連市繼續報漲、油漲三角左右、豆漲四五分、餅市不動、惟晨間滬上開盤時多頭頗有回出、新買亦淡、市面未能繼續上砌、祇黄豆現貨邇日本客去化均活、廠胃尤貪、到貨各行消通、故標豆補空甚健、又被連市帶好、市乃歩歩轉好、收市歩漲四六分不一、標油行號不出、價亦歩好一角半、標餅賣氣較盛、價仍回小一分左右、</p>
<p>昨日黄豆被大連電告轉定、人心又被牽制、惟銷塲不斷、市氣得以立住、行情比前市升砌一二分、計成交頴州豆四車、蚌埠豆三車、郯城豆八百包、宿遷豆一百五十餘包、沙市豆二百餘包、杜豆沙黄一千三四百包、漢口豆一千五百餘包、及遲豆三百五十包、九江冬豆三百餘包、</p>

<p>（七）營業年度　營業年度者，會計决算上所定之年度也，故又名會計年度。依公司法第一百六十六條及第二百六十條之規定，股份有限公司及股份兩合公司，每營業年度終，董事或無限責任股東應造具决算書表等，交監察人查核，以備報告於股東會。無限公司及兩合公司，公司法雖無營業年度字樣之規定，然其盈餘之分派，及第一類營利事業所得税之計算、均有待於每年之决算。則營業年度，要亦有確定之必要。故所得税暫行條例施行細則第八條，規定第一類甲乙兩項營利事業之所得，每年結算一次。此種年度之起訖，如採用曆年制，則自每年一月一日起至十二月三十一日止。如不採用曆年制，則可依各業之習慣或十務上之便利，任擇一日期。祇須滿足十二個月，即成爲一年度。本表之所塡報者，則其起訖之年月日也。例如每年三月一日起至翌年二月底止，或每年以商家總結束期爲止等均是。依所得税暫行條例第八條之規定，第一類甲乙兩項營利事業之所得，應由納税義務者於每年結算後三個月內，報告於主管徵收機關。其所稱結算，即决算也。今年爲第一類營利事業所得税開徵之第一年，如營業年度不依曆年制，自民國二十六年一月一日起至本營業年度開始之前一日止，應依施行細則第九條及第二十二條之規定，另行結算，申報其所得額。商家今年之依商家總結束期（即二月十日止）結束者，其自一月一日至二月十日止期間內之第一類營利事業所得，究應如何申報，政府當局尚在考慮中。惟曾發表待本年度終，同時分别報解耳。</p>
<p>（八）備考　備考地位，用以塡報上開各種事項外之事項者也。通常之應塡報者，約有二項：（一）公積金。依所得税暫行條例施行細則第七條及第一類營利事業所得税納税須知第十一條之規定，公司依法令所提存之公積金，得以三分之一併入資本計算，以算出所得合資本實額百分之若干。此項公積金，即指公司法第一百七十條所規定之公積金。其與將來所得税之計算，關係甚大，應於備考地位塡報之。（二）本支店。依所得税暫行條例施行細則第六條及第一類營利事業所得税徵收須知草案第二條之規定、本店及其分支店同在國內者、除資本及營業完全獨立者外、可合併計算其所得額。則此種分支店，應先於本表備考地位塡報，並報明其合併計算之事由，以備將來之查考。如塡報本表者爲分支店，而資本並不劃分者，在前開之股份總額及實收股額地位，可塡明資本在本店之字樣，而於備考地位塡報本店之名稱，及其所在地。娮其分支店有合於所得税暫行條例施行細則第五條及第一類營利事業所得税徵收須知草案第五條所規定應分别計算其所得額，而將在國外部份營業上之盈餘剔除者，麡應於本表備考地位塡報之。</p>
<p>（九）塡報日期　塡報本表之日期，亦應塡入本表。上開各事項之塡報於本表者，皆應塡報日當時之情形。如將來發生變更，無論其所變更者爲何種事項，均應爲變更之報告。（未完）</p>

<h3>訪問家庭主婦之效力</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>本市國貨運動聯合會，訪問家庭主婦工作，辦理已有半年，雖未能普遍收效，但據，國貨公司以及各工廠同人談話，很有許多主顧，都從訪問中來。</p>
<p>一天早上吾在五和織造廠，遇到銀行界老前輩宋漢章先生，正在選購棉毛衫，謂其家中人一致景仰國貨不待訪問，已能自己上門來購，宋老先生爲國內金融界之權威，其信仰國貨如此，吾國貨界當如何淬厲奮勉，以毋負宋先生之美意與熱忱。</p>
<p>又一天赴康元廠，訪康原先生，適有某公館電話至，則李太太謂舊歷新年中擬以玩具饋贈親戚家之小孩，以代壓歳錢，聽女訪問員報告，貴廠玩具，富有教育意味，故請先送些樣子來，以便大批採購，其訪問效力，又見一斑。</p>
<p>最近有人托吾向亞浦耳買大宗燈泡，又有人問新亞藥廠之玻璃杯及各種新藥，三友社鴻新廠之各種布疋，中國化學工業社及五洲之化裝品之各色綢緞，均謂都從女訪問員口中得來。即此一些消息，可見事在人爲，家庭主婦，誰不愛國，誰無良心，誰不樂用國貨，誰不信仰國産，只須有人説明勸告，予以種種之指導耳。</p>
<h3>建立城隍廟國貨商塲</h3>
<p>— 喬劍花女士</p>
<p>這次廢曆新年。內地來了幾個朋友。未能免俗的陪了她們到各處玩玩。那一天下午。到了南市的城隍廟。熱鬧擁擠的情形。不必多説。在那裏最值得我們注意的。要算是各個商店和販賣攤了。所陳列的東西。恐怕有百分之九十以上是舶來品。尤其是我們親善的友邦所製造的。要佔絶大多數。</p>
<p>我們到一家點心店樓上。吃一些特具風味的點心。大家談論到這個嚴重的問題。同時看見對面被燬的小世界遊藝塲。房屋至今没有修復。認爲大可利用這舊址。設計一個完備的國貨商塲。</p>
<p>我們的意見歸納起來。</p>
<p>第一，上海的城隍廟是名聞世界的所在地。無論初來上海或是旅滬較久的外國人。亦去遊的很多。看到目前舶來品充斥的情形。不是把我們國民的台多坍盡了嗎。從國際觀瞻上説。城隍廟設立國貨商塲是必要的。</p>
<p>第二，上海南京路的國貨商塲。地位似乎不是最好。而營業還算發達。可是住居南市的人。每有購買不便的感覺。逛城隍廟本是內地來的人或住居上海的人所大家要的。那末順便買些應用物品。也是人情之常。在此設一國貨商塲。以城隍廟地位之優勝。營業發達。可操左劵。</p>
<p>第三，小世界遊藝塲被燬。在目前遊藝塲已到末路的時代。似乎不必急求單獨的恢復。何妨將小世界舊址全部翻建五層水泥房屋。底層可仍照目前辦法。出租於各店舖。但一以販賣國貨爲條件。二層三層爲國貨大商塲。四層可做寫字間。五層可做遊藝塲。那麽規模宏大。市面繁盛。是不成問題的。</p>
<p>第四，小世界舊址的地主。聽説有好幾家。大部份是浦東三林學校校董會所有。該會校董。都是熱心愛國份子。那末該會之贊同此計劃。是毫無疑義的。其他一部份是市政府所有。那想來更不成問題。倘使由國貨團體或是上海市社會局發起。聯絡該地地主和城隍廟董事會。組織一個設計委員會。負責進行。如此則衆擎易舉。國貨商塲的實現是不難的。</p>
<p>第五，經費的籌集。或由地主任建築費。各國貨廠任營業費。或另組公司。或各廠聯營。或完全由婦女管理門市。樹立婦女商業的模範。都可歸設計委員會負責商討。具體辦法。這裏决定。暫且不提。</p>
<p>這樣粗淺的意見。在事實上能不能實行。希望賢明的當局。愛國的市民。和國貨廠家。一同起來。求辦法的充實而具體。漸漸地從言論而成爲事實。那末抛磚引玉。筆者廢曆新年的遊覽城隍廟。覺得絶對有意義了。</p>
<h3>從入超談到國貨同業聯合産銷</h3>
<p>— 程學鵬</p>
<p>，以武力做他們的後盾來逃避這一道僅有的關税。或者更乾脆些，就在中國開起廠來，利用中國低賤的原料和勞工，在他們科學化的經營之下，製造出大量的商品來傾銷到各地去，壟斷我國的市塲。處於這種局面下的國貨事業，要怎樣才能抬起頭來呢？</p>
<p>（二）運輸問題—交通爲産業發展的要素，我國鐵路既不發達，公路也嫌不便，因此大部分貨物的運輸是靠航行，而我國內河航行的主權又都操在外人之手，所以國貨發展的命運也就受着外人的支配。雖然國營與國人自辦的輪船也有，但是牠的比例數也少得可以，往往不够分配，只得仰仗於外輪，外輪載運國貨，水脚既貴，且多遲緩，何况其中尚有海關的黑幕，結果華商祇有望洋興嘆而已！</p>
<p>單從上述兩點看來，國貨要獲得最後的勝利，確爲難事。不過我認爲除了掃除一切足以防害國貨事業發展的障礙物以外，惟有國貨同業工廠實行聯合産銷制，才是最好的辦法，其故安在？兹分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）實行聯會産銷後，可以調查市塲需要情形，統制生産數量和銷售價格，不致受供過於求而賤價競賣之影響。</p>
<p>（二）劃一標準，使生産標準化。</p>
<p>（三）原料可由「同業聯合産銷處」大量購進，分發各工廠，减輕成本。</p>
<p>（四）設置研究會，專門研究該業之産品，發現較好之製造方法時，應秘密公開，各工廠同受其利。</p>
<p>（五）因聯合産銷，得統制産品市塲，與舶來品競爭。</p>
<p>（六）因産銷事務由「同業，答産銷處」負責辦理聯故各廠家開支可較省。</p>
<p>上述六項，均爲國貨同業工廠連合産銷之利益，其實行時之具體方案，因非本文範圍以內，故從略。</p>
<p>翻開每年的海關貿易册來一看，知道我國歷年以來都有巨額的入超，因此一般人莫不担着極大的心事，認爲國貨之所以不能抬頭，完全是入超的關係。實在這是過慮的，我的意見如下：</p>
<p>（一）在工業落後的我國，要仰給於外國的貨物很多，勢必入超。</p>
<p>（二）進口貿易分有形與無形兩種，有形即進口貨，無形的爲外人投資，華僑匯欵，以及外人來華之遊歷費等等均屬。同時我們要知道國際間的付欵，不一定直接支付現金（Cash），而大多是取商品的方式。歐戰以後我國國際貿易上曾經發生過下述二個現象：</p>
<p>（一）入超較大之年反是白銀流入較多之年。</p>
<p>（二）出口貿易增加之年反是白銀流出較多之年。</p>
<p>從上所述，可知入超並不一定是現銀流出，現銀流入並非一定是出超。所以實際上入超决不如一般人所以爲的那樣嚴重，反之，我們應當容許有入超。</p>
<p>致於國貨之所以不能抬頭的問題，那是錯綜複雜，决非本文所能盡述。現在我僅提出最重要的一點，希望全國提倡國貨運動者和國貨廠商注意。</p>
<p>這一點就是「國貨同業工廠聯合産銷」問題。在未叙述本問題的重要以前，須先來檢討一下目前的國貨環境若何。</p>
<p>（一）收税問題—我國的關税率雖已比任何獨立國家低上幾倍，可是帝國主義者還要嫌高</p>
<h3>介紹「國貨運動的一支輕騎隊」</h3>
<p>— 胥松子女士</p>
<p>記得家庭訪問工作剛剛開始的時候，仰葊先生曾昭示我們説：「主婦是購買國貨的主體，倘使主婦熱心國貨，國貨的出路當然通行無阻。可是怎樣打開這條出路，便是女訪問員的任務。」</p>
<p>在目前，家庭訪問工作業已進行半載，深得萬千主婦維護的今日，任誰以爲所應討論的，不是剷除出路上的障礙，而爲工作的奠立問題，那該是愚不可及的看法吧。</p>
<p>對於那些不聰明的疑慮，自然會有事實反證牠的謬誤。我們所念念不忘的，當是怎樣補救工作的缺憾，使工作更順利地進行？」</p>
<p>從實際工作中，我們深深的覺得，每次和主婦的見面，固然是看了當時的情况，發表適當的談話，總以引人入勝之後轉向本題，方算達到的。但另一方面，却因顧慮工作效率的普遍，又不能不將談話在短時間內告一段落，因此，這是難免有言不盡意之處的。况在洋貨充塞市塲的今日，一般主婦，都有無法辨别國貨真僞的痛苦，縱經詳細解釋，也不免因貨品各物太多，而會有「掛一漏萬」的地方。</p>
<p>其次，是各廠商托我們代發的贈品劵和宣傳品，雖然大部份都算華貴實用，得着不少成效，但因各廠紙色不一，很不適於長期保存，難有久遠的效力。至於説到我們曾經手代發及日常經見的國貨刋物，數量也很不少，若究其實際，除本刋——國貨專刋和少數類似刋物，有她的指導國貨運動嚴肅意義外，大都廣告重於內容，雖編者自以爲極盡宣揚能事，却使人一見，即目爲「廣告刋物」，能否受人歡迎，可想而知。然而，一般主婦的希求良好讀物的供給，又是一件很實際的事情吧。</p>
<p>如上所説的一些缺憾，雖然是小小的私見，但爲訪問工作的前途（亦即國貨運動的前途）着想，該是不容忽視的問題。</p>
<p>對於這些缺憾如何補救，我們已經有過長時期的考慮，那就是本文所要介紹這以國貨運動中一支經騎隊的姿態出現的，「主婦之友」半月刋的發刋？</p>
<p>我們認爲：在現狀下，以提倡國貨爲本位而內容豐富的刋物是很少的。至於能迎合主婦心理，深入家庭的，更不多見。我們希望，我們在工作之餘來編行的這個「主婦之友」，稍能盡她微小的貢獻呢。</p>
<p>我們希望「主婦之友」的是：——</p>
<p>（一）她將有華貴的外觀，豐富的內容，使主婦在「潛移默化」中深受國貨宣傳。</p>
<p>（二）對於國貨出品，作系統的介紹，以補我們和主婦談話的不足。經常商討一般國貨的辨别方法，使主婦不致誤買外貨。並特設國貨咨詢欄，留備主婦咨詢。</p>
<p>（三）站在主婦的立塲，以公正的態度批評國貨，使優良出品能益顯其優點；粗製濫造者，得有改進的機會。</p>
<p>（四）另闢「國貨市塲」專欄，將日常生活所需的國貨，分類編制，以便主婦購取貨品時，有「按圖索驥」的便利。</p>
<p>（五）各廠商廣告及贈劵，都可附頁刋入。既可省各自印刷的糜費，又有永久給主婦珍惜的價值和效力。</p>
<p>（七）每期出版，由訪問員親致主婦之手，使家庭主婦與訪問員間，保持永久而真摯的友誼，實際上，也就是促進她們對於國貨運動有廣大而深刻的觀感。</p>
<p>自然我們的能力是很薄弱的。可是，能否擔當得起這個重大的工作，不是我們要問的。我們要問，在外貨鐵蹄下的國貨運動者，是否有奮發起來，爭取「購買國貨的主體」，　織自己的輕騎隊，給外貨以襲擊的必要呢</p>
<p>最後，我們是伸開要求的手在這兒了，願一切同情我們的人們，不吝他的援手呵！</p>
<h3>閒話送禮</h3>
<p>— 王永濤</p>
<p>我們是寄存在社會上的，爲了聯絡感情和其他的一切關係，對於送禮的俗例，是積極難免吧！如你的朋友，有喜慶的事情，在你接到喜帖之後，就要打算送一筆禮物去，但送去禮物，亦須受對方歡迎，否則，送得不得法，就會遭對方的不快，最近我所見到的，便是個很好的例證，就是我的朋友李君，於上月結婚，我聞知這個喜訊，就送去一張國貨禮劵，同時，他的親友，也都不約而同的紛紛前來送禮，後來經李君細細檢查全部份禮物，內中除去少數的現金和軸子外，四分之三各大公司的禮劵，李君是素來提倡國貨的，他不覺摇着頭對我説：「唉！這許多禮劵，何不改送國貨禮劵，呌我怎樣去兑國貨呢？……」就這樣看來，可知道送禮考慮的必要了。</p>
<p>上海的中國國貨公司，和三友實業社，都是很偉大的純粹國産商店，所出售的貨物，如布疋毛織化妝等，簡直是應有盡有，且發售國貨禮劵，甚爲精美樸實，可以隨時十足兑貨，你把這禮劵，送給親友，他不但很歡迎，而且敬佩你是個提倡國貨的愛國分子，故筆者謹希讀者諸君，今後應採用國貨禮劵，俾對於國貨前途，有無限的發展希望。</p>

<h3>所得稅施行後工商界應注意三事（續）</h3>
<p>李文杰在市民會演請　可供工商界重要參考</p>
<p>（丙）决算時應加注意的事項</p>
<p>决算是表現會計正確紀錄財產增減變化情形的結果、營利事業所得稅的申報和繳納都在會計年度結束以後、所以决算也右以說是繳納所得稅的準備工作的最重要部份、於此我們對於現行所得稅法的立法原則應認識兩點、</p>
<p>㊀年度課稅主義的採行、和㊁應收應付制的嚴格引用、根據第一點、所以上年度營業的虧損、不得列入本年度計算、本於第二點所以第一類征收須知草案、明白解釋收入總額及實際開支的含義、及規定各種資產（包括遲延資產在內）的佔價方法前向已經說明過、本文是以現行法規的規定做骨幹、對於這些規定的得失短長、恕不發表意見、以下分述决算時應行注意的事項、</p>
<p>㊀總店與分支店會計的合併假定總分店間並未劃分資本、營業亦不完全獨立、在决算時公支店的帳目、應與總店的賬目合併决算、藉以表現其整個的財政狀況及營業成績、如果總店賬目的决算、只限於本店的資產負債及損益、對於撥付分支店的欵項貨物、用“分支店往來”科目、列入總店賬目內、對於分支店的資產負債及損益、不加顧問、則决算表冊不能表示全般的營業狀況、結出的盈虧數、卽非正確、對於所得稅的計算基礎、當然亦見動搖、所以總店辦理决算時、必須把分支店的資產負債損失利益諸項目、合併計算在內、</p>
<p>㊁應收未收應付未付預收預付各項的整理一般工商機關、多未採用新式會計制度、在結賬時、對於應收未收應付未付、預收預付各項應行整理的賬目每不重視、或者不加整理、或者雖加整理、只及比較重大的數項目、他們以為此項應收未收應付未付的賬目、儘可在將來收付的時候，再行記賬、至於預收預付的賬目、對外不再生銀錢上收支的關係更沒有整理的必要不知賬目按期結算、原來就是為的要明悉各年度的營業情形和盈虧數目某一會計年度內的損益計算、能夠確實表示該年度捐益情形、才算發揮會計的效能、所以在結賬時、必須將應收未收應付未付各項、一一查明轉賬、預收預付各項賬目亦同、預收為遲延負債應從收益中轉山預付為遞延資產、應從損失中轉出、均須按照時間為比例的計算、加以整理、而後年度損益計算及期末的資產負債狀況、可以正確、所得稅卽以正確的年度純益額為征課基礎、更可顯見本條所述會計原則的重要性、</p>
<p>㊂存貨的估價查我國商人通例第二十七絛第二項、對於財產目録之造具、規定應附記現時之價格、時價高於原價時、須記其原價、第一類征收須知草案所附資產估計方法、第一項則規定資產之估價除本方法別有規定外、以原價為標準、原價高於時價時、以時價為標準文字雖不相同、其採取時價與原價孰世之原則則、以往之工商業對於年終貨價估計折扣的决定、往往任意伸縮、大槪盈餘優厚年份將存貨折價作低、盈餘不多或虧折的年份、則將存貨任意作高並將歷年所存的滯銷貨物也用高價列入以減少虧損或增加盈餘、這種處理方法、實係因果倒置自欺欺人、現行所得稅法、對於商品的估價、明定方法、上述流弊可以因而糾正、</p>
<p>㊃固定資產的折舊固定資產的種類、本於其構造情形所定的最短耐用年數、及其最大折舊率、與估價的標準、在資產估價方法中、都有很詳細的規定、這些規定是否合理、適用時有無窒礙、固然是個問題然而給予工商機關以合一的準𦃰、可使以往隨意伸縮的流弊、不再發生也是一件值得稱贊的事、</p>
<p>㊄呆賬的剔除在學理上本有“綜合估計法”，和個別剔除法“二種、惟一者不能同時採用、现行法是採取個別剔除法、資產估價方法第十九條規定、銷貸賬欵、應收賬欵應收票據、及各項欠欵等債權，有左列情事之一者、得列為損失、㊀因倒閉、逃匿、或受破產之宣告、或其他原因、致債權之一部或全部、不能收回者、㊁債權中的逾期二年、經合法之催收、未能收取本金或利息者、就是這個意思、法意尚屬寬格並能救濟自由估計呆帳、伸縮損益的</p>
<p>㊅無形資產的折除出價取得作為資產的營業權和著作權、限十年折除完畢、商標權•專用權•及其他各種特許權等、各依其取得後法定享有之年數折除究畢、</p>
<p>㊆開辦費的攤提至短期間為五年</p>
<p>㊇結算報告及納稅的截止期、依照暫行條例第八條及施行細則第廿十六條的法意、營業年度為自一月一日至于一月三十一日、及照廢歷結帳者、結算事宜須在二月底以前辦竣、其以七月一日至來年六月三十日為營業會計年度者、須在七月底以前、將結算辦竣在上半年、以三月一日至五月三十一日之三個月為申報及納稅期限、在下半年、以八月一日至十月三十日為申報及納稅期限、按照施行細叫第三十三條之規定主管怔收機關、决定所得税額的期間、為收到申報人的申報十五日內、所以申報的截止期、比較納稅的截止期、至短應提前十五日卽上半年為五月十六日、下半年為十月十五日、</p>
<p>㊈申報的文件填具第一類所得額甲種報告表、並提出財產目錄資為負債表、損益計算書、或其他是以證明其所得額之帳薄文據、財產目錄中、並應註明各項財產的原價與時價的差額及其估定之價類於此有應說明者、報告表裏所列的純所得額興損益計算書裹面所列的純益額、絕不相同、最明顯的差額、就是法定公積金的扣除、此外半時支列錯誤的不應減除的項目、也須在申報以前分別加以調整、在英美各國、這類調盤工作工商機關為節省時間宇續和避免違法的危險超見往往委託會計師辦理、以臻完善、以上所述各點、都不過本於個人觀察所及、並參照法規內容加以闡述、所得稅是已施行了、施行以後、吾人實際上所感覺到的困難、必將十百倍於吾人所預料、希望賢明的征收機關長官、能於納稅人通力合作、來克制這種種必經的困難、良好的所得稅制的基礎和推進的前程、卽將於此奠定、那是個人所馨香祝禱的、（完）</p>

<h3>孫少卿包濫詞訟捕房加控二案</h3>
<p>一為姚月波案一為潘雪艶案　又有周湘雲一案亦係孫經辦　昨日法院訊問諭令禁止旁聽</p>
<p>通州人孫少卿、因有包濫詞訟、恐嚇詐財嫌疑、經公共捕房華督察長陸連奎•探長劉紹奎•等拘捕、解出第一特區法院、業依刑法一五七條三四六條起訴包濫孫吳桂珍與吳登瀛析產事件、而取得四萬元一案、各情已誌本報、昨日午後、此案由特一法院刑庭長錢鴻業開刑一庭續訊、經諭令</p>
<p>禁止旁聽</p>
<p>先由捕房律師汝葆彝起稱、除上次已起訴之案外、今日加控二案㊀有南通人姚月波（姚仁興營造廠主）的與其兄姚仁義（姚順興營造廠主）合包工程、旋姚仁義死、卽由其子姚志春繼承一切事業、姚月波卽於三十年與姪清算該包工賬目、令給付應得之一萬元權利因姚志春不允、乃託被告孫少卿出與交涉經孫轉</p>
<p>託朱南山</p>
<p>醫生調停、結果以五千元和解成立、但姚月波實祇得到一千五百元㊁名女伶潘雪艶（現適住居巨籟達路同福里號花旗銀行之高級職員鄭永泉）、於二十四年十一月間、曾委託被告孫少卿向一名徐懋昌（大豐紗廠主、為大英銀行買辦徐懋棠之弟）、者索詐二萬元、後經徐委託吳麟坤律師以</p>
<p>一萬九千</p>
<p>元之代價立據了結、而潘所得甚少今日證人姚月波•及吳麟坤•顧公秉•二律師均到庭、而陳霆銳律師因病不能到案云云、遂將證人姚月波之供單呈案、庭上卽傳吳登瀛之子吳申伯至案、謂本院曾向爾之代表律師陳霆銳訽問、據稱在案未了之前、爾等曾接　嚇電話、及有人</p>
<p>尾隨爾等</p>
<p>之汽車、但吳絕對否認、時孫少卿之妻孫朱氏在庭、經庭上傳案、訊以前有女子吳月娥訴周湘雲一案、係爾夫經辦、後以七萬元和解、爾知否、據答吳月娥前與本人同居、曾經吳之請求到庭作證則有之、餘均不知、庭上詢以該案經本院查明、係爾天與已死之唐嘉鵬所合辦、是否、氏亦答不知、捕房律師汝葆彝卽聲明、氏有</p>
<p>共犯嫌疑</p>
<p>捕房須予以偵查、繼由錢庭長傳吳麟坤律師到案、據其證稱、在二十四年十一月之某日、徐懋昌至福煦路福明邨六十七號後之家內、謂前與潘雪艶因觀劇相識或有約同吃飯之字絛等留於潘手、致潘挾此以為曾與發生關係之證據、需案二萬元、現已經孫少卿•蔡福棠•調解成立、惟須立一</p>
<p>永斷糾葛</p>
<p>字據、說明與潘無關及收回字條、本律師常代為擬稿後因欲交欵、於某日孫少卿•蔡福棠•潘洪生•等同來本律師處堅主須潘親到、方可交欵、因此孫與潘洪生在本律師家內互毆、經制止始停嗣後經潘雪艶與孫等同來、始立據將一萬元交付了結、該據上孫少卿•蔡福棠•共居調人地位、今日徐懋</p>
<p>因事在杭</p>
<p>不能到案、已委陸益方會計師代表到庭云云、繼由庭上訊陸、謂徐須一星期後方能到庭、詁之孫少卿、對於此案完全否認、謂並無經手此案之事、錢庭長繼傳姚月波到庭、據供、因我姪不尢將我應得之權利分給、故氣極在百老匯路東興爾茶樓與樓主殷祥發言、及經殷介紹與孫少卿辦理、言明</p>
<p>四六分派</p>
<p>山江肇周書一契約、結果以五千元了結、詎孫竟分給我一千五百元、餘均為所吞、亦無可奈何、至孫吳氏確係我介紹，氏住於孫家約一年孫初索二十萬繼減至十二萬•七萬最後始以四萬元談妥、而孫祇給孫吳氏一萬一千五百元、而給我酬勞車資五百元聞孫言及曾</p>
<p>在四川路</p>
<p>尾隨過吳登瀛之汽車次云云、旋由顧公秉律師證明孫吳氏案係由孫少卿於解决前四五天、囑我辦理當在陳霆銳律師公館交欵時、孫亦在塲、當時對方陳律師將莊票交我、由我轉交與孫吳氏、以後之事不得而知云云、錢庭長當向係詰問、由孫仍始終否認、庭上乃諭本案改期一星期再訊、</p>

<h3>工作</h3>
<p>— （閻重樓）</p>
<p>工作就是人生。</p>
<p>今日的成就，就是昨日的工作積勞；今日的窮困，就是昨日的生活閒逸！</p>
<p>有工就有生存。</p>
<p>人們不能受强廹的工作，所以要能够自動的工作。</p>
<p>閒逸不一定是快樂，工作不一定是痛苦。</p>
<p>一個人整日爲了工作勞動不息，你就可以知道他絶對是個優良的份子。</p>
<p>多做工作，可以消除妄念。</p>
<p>把難的工作做過以後，便會覺得那工作並不很難。</p>
<p>今日的工作不做完，便把明日做工作的地位佔去了！</p>
<p>在工作的隊伍中單獨不工作，和在閒逸的一羣中單獨去勞動，是一樣的要感覺到難受。</p>
<p>無論社會變成怎樣的制度，人們總不能没有工作。</p>

<h3>保安司徒廟</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>上海南京路，誰都知道是一條最繁華的長路，同時因爲它物質太過於文明了，所以又被號稱爲大馬路，説它爲上海第一條馬路。可是文明固然文明，但却有一個十八世紀的迷信玩意兒在那兒哩！你道什麽？就是本文所記的保安司徒廟（俗稱虹廟。）</p>
<p>筆者在上海已久，未曾去參觀過，原因是上海有許多有其名而無其實的玩意兒，因此我縱使經過其門，猶不曾注意及呢：</p>
<p>昨天閒着無聊，特地到南京路去跑跑，才使我注意到保安司徒廟來了。商得同伴的同意，終於跑進去參觀了十餘分鐘。</p>
<p>這廟原來在泰康食品公司隔壁，一開間門面，門額上有五個大金字：「保安司徒廟」。踏入門檻，就是賣佛珠，佛書，以及求神唸經的用品。二沿邊掛着「有求必應」的匾額，都是信徒所贈。中央置着一位不知名的神像，峨峨直立，很是威風。再入內是正殿了，也許是香火太盛了吧？使進去的人，眼睛也不能張開，燒香膜拜的人非常擁擠；還有許多出賣肉體和出賣人格的婦女，也拿着香很虔誠的跪拜，據説拜後營業比較好點，我不禁暗暗好笑，神道會教人注意性，那末那位神不是不正了嗎？這或許是他們所謂的「有求必應」的玄妙吧？</p>
<p>折入左邊廂房是一位求卦問卜和替人合婚姻的拆字菩薩。戴着黑眼鏡，穿着藍色袍子，元色馬褂，端端正正的坐着，面前置着一張桌子，桌前放香爐一個，內有一枝香，並燃着的！是神？是人？我實在無法辨别。於是將信將疑地跑了出來。</p>
<p>回到馬路來，眼前的景象，似乎已換了一個「爲什麽迷信在中國，老是這樣狺獗呢？」同伴問我。我似無言可答，祇得向他苦笑着。</p>

<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回（絮語感慈幃懺情殉孝黯秋光翠黛觸景書懷）</p>
<p>他夾書包出門去的時候，小菊也就跟送到大門外來，手扶了門框，站在石門框上對了他的後影看着。等他走去了幾歩，却輕輕叫了一聲小姐。夢蘭回頭問他有什麽事。小菊笑着説没有作事。夢蘭道：你這小東西，倒拿我開心。叫我作什麽？説畢，自向前走。小菊隨在後面，又追了幾歩，又笑着叫道：小姐，我和你説句話。夢蘭道：有話你就説，鬼頭鬼腦的樣子幹什麽。這才停住了脚，回轉身望了他道：有什麽話，你倒是説。小菊將一個食指按住了嘴唇，微揚着頭，向他臉上望着。因道：我對小姐説了，你更要發愁了。夢蘭笑道：你怕我發愁，你就不必對我説了。小菊回轉身來，摸了辮子梢。將脚在地面上畫着因道：小姐待我很好，我要是不説，我良心上過不去。這句話，倒是引起了夢蘭的注意，這就立住了脚没有動，向他望着道：你且説，有什麽要緊的事。你總知道我爲人，我决不能説是你告訴我的。小菊回頭看着自己門口，走近一歩，靠住夢蘭身邊，低聲道：小姐大喜的日子，已經擇定了，是九月二十四日。老爺的意思，早就要告訴你。太太説是老早的告訴了小姐，老早的就要淘氣。不如等到日子擺在眼前，再同小姐説。我心裏就很替小姐難過，這樣的大事，怎好不告訴你呢？可是我又胆小，不敢多嘴。因爲昨晚上二少奶同你説話，已經告訴了一半了。所以我索興把這一半也告訴你。夢蘭聽着，先是怔了一怔，隨後便是道：事先你爲什麽不告訴我呢？小菊道：事先我怎麽敢説呢？全家都不提一個字。夢蘭點點頭道：好，我知道了，你回去罷。他交代了這句話已畢，微微的歎了一口氣，掉轉身來，自一歩歩的向學校路上走去。他本來就是愁眉不展的人，經過了這一度談話，更是在那淸秀的面龐上，加了一層憂鬱的意味。去的時候，心裏想着心事，是一歩歩的看了地面走去。散學回來的時候，還是這樣一歩歩的量着地面走回來。不過在半路上，却不時的抬頭向前面看去。這似乎冥冥之中，起了什麽感應，在他抬頭向前看去的時候，章國器是在他這個姿態中出現了。平常兩人相遇，夢蘭總是裝着毫無所知的樣子，交錯的過去。至多是向國器看上兩眼，在那眼光一瞥之中，把百千萬句的言語，都代表過去了。（一四三）</p>

<h3>世界四大巨頭的軼事（上）</h3>
<p>— 晁溪</p>
<p>三，製造筒麵的墨索里尼</p>
<p>意大利可怕的墨索里尼，其平生的臉容也决不像那常見於新聞的相片那樣的可怕，實則他那時時隱現着的微笑，常使和他接見過的人們否認這獨裁者有那公開攝影的相片所顯示的那嚴酷的臉容，並且墨索里尼的聲音，聽來又是極其悦耳的，所以有些人竟要説，這墨索里尼如果不志於所謂政治家的無聊的勾當，而專心於歌唱的修養，則他將成爲一個音樂家卡路梭的後繼者。</p>
<p>這有權有勢的法西斯統帥，現在是傾其熱情與精力以宣傳其主張於大衆之前，可是在從前他是去鼓吹社會主義的人物，他的確是一個二重人格的所有主，在聽衆的面前或和要人對談時，常擺着莊嚴面孔的墨索里尼，和在家中恣意躭樂於飲食時的他，顯然大相差異，這不免行之過甚了。</p>
<p>他最好吃加了自製醬汁的筒麵Macolam，在他的食桌旁，常設置着特製的蒸鍋，和盛着醬汁的小壺，當他的僕人從蒸鍋中拿起筒麵，恭恭敬敬捧在他面前的時候，他動其得意的鼻子，用木杓取一些他家傳的醬汁加味於其中，這樣地弄好之後，他的僕人才把筒麵送到來客的面前，據説曾有一個見惡於墨索里尼的勇士，有一次把這獨裁者所自製的筒麵拒絶了，於是他被流到地中海的島上去。</p>
<p>四，雄辯的希特拉</p>
<p>焚書，放逐猶太人，極用壓廹政治之手段的國社黨首領希特拉，在十九年前原也不過是一上士兵而已，他的豐滿的肉體中，就是現在也依然存在着當時的精神。最近他常穿着無領的早服，恰似一個運動家，他這是在努力顯示其安閑的態度，但是他依然要找着美國方面新聞記者對陣：「我個人最討厭的是所謂批評，那只有使問題更加糾紛而已，現在德國是處於非常時期中，自凡爾賽條約簽字以來十四年間，我德國人之自殺者達二十二萬四千名，那不是一日要自殺四人嗎？德國在一八七○年與法國打代，也没有戰死六萬人以上呢？……」（一九三三年接見新聞記者時）這簡直連獨語都用演説口調了，確不愧爲一個對陣的雄辯家。</p>

<h3>賽金花的葬地陶然亭</h3>
<p>— 陳效坎</p>
<p>一代英雌賽金花自從在北平病死後，身後蕭條，其家人幾無力爲之埋葬，幸得一般慈善家追念賽氏當年爲國奔走的功績，大家就慨解仁囊，捐貲替伊埋葬在平市南郊的陶然亭畔，賽氏有知，亦當目瞑無憾了。</p>
<p>陶然亭據説是淸朝郎中江藻釀資建造的，亭基很高，廻廊曲房，很可以遠眺平市的風景呢。</p>
<p>不過這兒都是郊外的風物，而且是十分荒凉寂寞；是以都市邊的人一到厭倦了它們的生命而撒手長逝時，總搬到那塊去做了一個歸宿的地方。「北邙惟見塚千堆」此地有焉！</p>
<p>可是北平四郊的墓地，並不像咱們內地來得少；爲什麽獨讓「陶然亭」去出名呢？這一點，也有一個文學上的因緣在荒塚稠疊中你可以找得一些駢四儷六文情俱佳的悽艷的詞句。</p>
<p>咱們現在先拏香塚來説：——這是一座草木叢生已成爲狐窟鼠穴的荒凉古墓，子孫散處，麥飯久虚，斷碣殘碑，已是弄的不成樣兒了，但是在那塊灰黑色的碑石上，依稀還可以辨出一點妙文來：</p>
<p>「浩浩愁·茫茫刧！短歌終，明月缺，鬱鬱佳城，中有碧血，血亦有時盡，月亦有時滅，一縷香魂無斷絶！是耶非耶？化爲蝴蝶！」</p>
<p>另有七絶一首，亦頗可讀，文云：</p>
<p>「飄零風雨可憐生，香夢迷離滿綠汀：落盡夭桃又濃李，不堪重讀瘞花銘。」</p>
<p>這座古墓里畢竟眼的是甚麽人？咱可不曉得。據那邊土人説：是從前名妓蒨雲的埋骨處；有的却説是當年香妃的秘密塚。言人人殊，誰也不能斷定。——距香塚止有二十歳武的所在，還有一個鸚鵡塚，也有一段銘文：</p>
<p>「文兮禍所伏：慧兮禍所生，吁嗟作賦傷正平。」</p>
<p>這座墳説是某代某有名文人焚稿的地方，他因着遭受了一種重大的刺㦸，無處可以洩憤恨，恨的就把所有文稿付諸一炬，將灰燼葬在地下。多末可惜呵！</p>
<p>賽金花一生事蹟，可歌可泣：亦悽亦艷，較之那點以色相博人愛憐的姨太太，人格要高出百倍，簡直不可同日而語咧！現在伊安葬在這個地方，那是再好也没有了。</p>
<p>——「香塚」上的那首七絶挽詩，也大可移贈與賽氏呢！……。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>許大使的幸運</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>前日日新任外相佐藤尚武，接見外交團，對各大使談話時間甚短，僅與我駐日大使許世英氏，談話時間甚長，以許大使行將返國也，六日許世英離京，起程返國，日方又開盛大之歡送會，表示好感，使臣往還，關係國際禮貌，自應有送往迎來之表示，但此次日方如此殷勤招待，實所罕見。</p>
<p>佐藤並向許大使表示，本人素路中日兩國間之和平必要，此后將力謀實現此種宿論，梁青許大使人格，仰慕已久，希望許大使能早日返任，共同在中日關係上有所貢獻，此種表示好感的態度，和甜蜜的論調，許大使問之，恐不免有受寵若驚之概。</p>
<p>現任彼方正高喊着經濟提携的標語，中日兩國間，行將化干戈而為玉帛，變戾氣不祥和，所以對於此次許氏之返國，更有遠大的企求，因此招待也格外的周到，許氏躬逢其盛，亦許氏始願所不及此也，但許氏雖為駐日大使，而外交方針，必須秉承中央當局的意旨，原不得自由應付，然許大使的責任，一面當匡動政府所不逮。一面可向日方直接折衝，其地位乏重要，不問可知，故許氏得蒙此優渥之禮遇，亦許氏之位望有以致之也。</p>
<p>然彼方一面以經濟提携為號召，而所謂經濟考察團者，一批一批的來華，作實地的調查，而又一方在華北方面，大增其兵，大演其操，完全欲以武力控制，武力侵佔，此種兩樣情態的舉動，與共說彼方外交上的兩元化，母齊說裹應外合的一元化也，在此種情形之下，而謂有親善之可能，誰實信之。</p>
<p>我國雖為世界上惟一愛好和平的國家，然在此種雙管齊下之壓迫下，也決不甘為人所欺蒙，為人所玩弄，而竟國置罔聞，絕不與之磨擦，而一到既成事實，更不好與彼商量，許大使身駐彼國，對於彼國內部的情形，與外界的觀察，必定較為深切，當必有高遠偉大的意見，貢獻於政府，决不因國際禮貌之間，感覺滿意，而認為晶兩國親善之徵也。</p>
<p>凡私人間之酬酢，若忽有人焉，無端與之親密，或無端而與之冷淡，則其冷淡與親密之間，必定考察其理由，而認識其情實，方可對付，否則為人所欺，事後悔之，亦無及矣，而況許使身膺國家之重寄，國家所賴以應付折衝者，亦惟許使是賴，其關係之重要，不問可知，我深望許使能其正認識彼方的情狀也。</p>
<h3>迎陳波兒及其他</h3>
<p>— 蕭梅</p>
<p>“上海婦孺綏遠前線慰勞團”代表陳波兒女士等回來了，和這新聞同時在報上出現的，還有許多紀念三八節的文章•這些文章的立論，大都是很正確的，要求民族的及自身的解放，要求在自由的天地中，和男子同樣的成為一個“堂堂的人”。</p>
<p>在政治和法律上，中国婦女是和共他國家的婦女同樣，和男子是平等的，但在教育上是怎樣呢？法律雖然規定男女有受同等的教育的權利，從大學出來，甚至從外洋留學回來的所謂智識婦女，在今日的中國也不能算少，然而試把視野放得大一些，落後的，做了一輩子牛馬的，不知教育為何物的婦女又有多少？為了經濟的從屬關係，受過教育和正地受教育的女子，和男子比較起來，又有怎樣的分別？</p>
<p>好些先哲們說過“女子是雙重的奴隸”的話，並不是誇張的說法，一般女子除和一般的男性勞働者同樣，是受支配者，在男女關係上，在這個男性中心社會中，她們也是奴隸，而在這“東方古國”的中國，封建餘孽並沒死絕，她們所受到的侮辱的損害，更超過其他的所謂文明國家而上之。</p>
<p>陳波兒等一行北上勞軍，所經歷的，便是一個很好的例。</p>
<p>據說陳波兒等北上勞軍的起初，是倍承各方的優待的，優待的原因很滑稽：因為陳波兒是電影明星。電影明星，這在一般人的心目中，是交際花之流差不了多少的，因之所謂勞軍也者，大抵也是巧立名目，但想不到一見之下，她們卻沒有妖艷的裝飾和輕佻的舉動，而到了綏遠之後，還居然出於意外的演了幾個在內地演不出的戲。這樣，電影明星是陪人上館子吃飯跳舞的玩物的觀念，固然是用事實來打破了，而繼之所受到的“優待”，是演不成戲，是種種的威嚇，則原也“活該”。</p>
<p>陳波兒等還是在社會上比較有地位的覺醒了的智識份子，她們所行的聊以自慰於心的“國民的職任”便受到了這樣的阻難和被曲解，其他處在黑暗中默默地生着，無休止的操勞着的婦女，又將會受到怎樣的侮辱和損害呢？</p>
<p>被“阻難”的原因，或許還可以解釋為“弱國”：（但我們不明白何以“弱國”連國民的天職都不能盡！）而被曲解，則又是什麼呢？</p>
<p>要打破“阻難”，那得在求民族解放的目標下去進行，而要免去被曲解侮辱，那非但得用事實來塞住那些污衊的嘴和心，還得在經濟的從屬關係上去求得總解决。</p>
<p>女子的經濟權如果一日不能獨立起來，那麼，女子就得一輩子做男性的奴隸，被曲解，那還是小矣哉的。</p>

<p>我在這個時候來到瑪德里，可算得千載難逢了。城中的街道，因為沒有清道夫工作，遍地都是垃圾；公園中的椅子，都七凌八亂，倒在地上；商店都緊閉門戶，有的玻璃窗已被搗碎，有的招牌已經除去，有的鐵棚倒下，把大門擋住，出入的人，必須俯身蛇行。時鐘都已停止，郵政局內部，業已燒燬，但壯美的外殼，却仍然存在，四面要口，都用郵包作障碍物，但不知袋裹是否裝着從未寄遞而為人望眼欲穿的家書。有一家報館，門前用未賣去的報紙堆成一座障碍物，上面排列着幾盆冬青樹，好像巴黎酒肆門前所見的一般。身體強壯的男子，每天都須受軍事訓練半天，所以糧食店只在早晨開門，買客當一排排地等着，有些店鋪却在午後開門。有一家精美的商店，專賣外國運入的男子服裝，還在出賣存貨，買客大都是軍官們。旁邊的商店都已完全破毁，它却巍然獨存，大約是恃着所掛的法國或別國的旗號吧。商店所存最有用的奢侈品，只有晚餐用的精美器具，和同類的物品，因為無人過問，到現在還剩着哩。應時而起的交易，都在沿街呌賣，其中有些是中國人，賣的是兵士所需的物品，如便用刀，修面用的材料，呢帽，廉價的寶石，假珠等類。我不知道這樣東西從何處販來，又不知道怎麼能運到瑪德里。那些小販有的在“大維亞街”人行道上設攤，有的在“浦爾太台爾索爾”大砲彈炸成的巨穴旁邊鋪着呌賣。因為地面彈穴很多，電車駛過的時候，郁非常謹愼。我曾見一個女子在一片青翠矮樹場上喂羊。城中的生活，凌亂無序，從前極壯麗的住宅，現都滿住着乞丐和難民，他們是由遭兵災的各處逃來的，也有在內搭成蓆棚，作久居之計。兵士對於他們，施捨很慷慨，可見在這殺人如麻的當兒，入的慈善心還沒消滅。有幾家作新時代裝飾的咖啡館，雖是取價極貴，但到了下午開市以後，都賣滿座。那些顧客都是請假出遊的軍人，他們的服裝，形形色色，難得看見，有戴着哥薩克帽的，有穿着羊皮大衣的，也有衣服很襤褸的。他們的語言，也很紛雜。他們都是國際縱隊的戰士，西班牙人民稱之為英雄，他們所要的東西，人民們只恨沒有，假使有的話，很願意供獻給他們的。他們像學童一般，一盆盆的糖饅頭送到他們面前，一霎眼便狼吞虎咽地吃光了。他們因為沒有巧格力糖與菓子醬吃很不悅意。現有只剩幾家咖啡館，還能供給些食品。德國兵士的狀貌，比他國兵士覺得蒼老，西民都很信任他們。國際縱隊的兵士會對我說道：“你瞧我們都是雄赳赳氣昂昂的，自已彼此見了也害怕。”從前咖啡館的四壁，都裝飾得很華麗，現在呢，都滿貼着宣傳的圖畫，看了使人驚心動魄！瑪德里城中有一座大紅色的高塔，現在彈孔纍纍，有卍字記號的一條大青蟒很想把它吞下。檢查員的辦公室，燈光黯淡，寫字樓上多舖了被褥辦事員夜裹都睡在上面。外國新聞訪員都經過一間廚房，來到“大維亞旅館”的底層餐室，坐在一張長案前進食。得閒，各人到他的本國大使署，盤桓片刻，在那裹可吸到些中立的空氣。我的食所，是在一家西班牙報館地窖之中，報館職員的廚房，設在裹面。那些職員們高談闊論，十分歡樂。有時還把麺包互擲嬉。我們常常用大豆充飢，目前不用說美味，便是家常的食品，也很不容易得到呢。</p>

<h3>上海業餘劇人將重演「慾魔」「大雷雨」「醉生夢死」</h3>
<p>上海業餘劇人上次公演之「慾魔」「大雷雨」「醉生夢死」三劇，不僅在上海極博好評，且在南京亦備受榮譽，國府暨中央黨部諸要人，戲劇家田漢，華漢，余上沅，馬彦祥，曹禺，當地文藝界，新聞界名流，以及法大使館參贊，俄大使館秘書等，於觀後莫不頷首稱道焉。</p>
<p>旅京歸來，卡爾登大戲院曾經理即將上海觀衆要求業餘劇人重演函件四百七十多封交諸鄭君里，其中有一封係出諸名戲劇家洪深先生之手者，業餘執委鑒於各界盛情難却，當即决定於本月十二日起將「慾魔」「大雷雨」「醉生夢死」公演七天，以答全滬人士之雅意云。</p>
<h3>「馬路天使」</h3>
<p>深夜立在街頭徘徊的女人，她們耐着飢餓寒冷，懷着希望的心期待着人們的憐憫。在燈紅酒緑，引吭高歌的當兒，也許你曾看到他們那樣淺笑輕顰，但是她們的靈魂，也許正在無邊的黑暗裏涰泣呻吟，這聲音是悲慘的。</p>
<p>「馬路天使」正是描寫着這類人的生活，以及如人們所膜視着的下層職業者的動静。</p>
<p>這樣的題材的製作，「馬路天使」還是初創，這新型的嘗試，將給觀衆們以新的深刻的印象。</p>
<p>編導者袁牧之，是人們所熟悉的，他在舞台上的功績，誰也承認是不可漠滅的，在影壇上貢獻，是同樣地偉大的。這「馬路天使」是他最近在明星的新作，是一部沉痛深刻的悲喜劇。</p>
<p>這裏有樂隊的喇叭手，報販，理髮師，妓女…………劇中人扮飾者有趙丹，魏鶴齡，周旋，謝俊，王吉亭，錢千里等。</p>
<p>另分更有舞台上爲觀衆所愛好的趙慧深女士，在本片裏客串一個妓女的角色。</p>
<h3>「彈性女兒」將近公映</h3>
<p>藝華即將公映之哀艷鉅片「彈性女兒」，自從開始攝製到完成，足有經過半載的悠久時期，關於這部戲所取的題材，是以闡發都會婦女職業問題及女性戀愛的理爲中心的一個現實劇旨，對於彷徨在罪惡的都會中的青年舞女，作一個深刻的論定。</p>
<p>「彈性女兒」的劇作者潘孑農，以靈的巧筆法，新頴的題材，插寫三個不同性情的舞女，飄蕩在煎熬的生活綫上，見不到她們的笑容，祇有傷心的哭臉，各人又遭遇到戀情的種種變幻，終年被埋在社會上　隱佈的陷阱中，任憑她們怎樣的掙扎，奮鬥，依然在黑暗中矇憧着，到何處去尋覓一些光明的出路呢。「彈性女兒」的劇旨，展示在我們面前的，是一部舞女血淚史。</p>
<p>「彈性女兒」由名導演陳鏗然擔任的，關於他在無聲片興盛的時期，曾經導演過一部「舞女血」，留着很好的印象。現在舊調重彈，出其以往的經騐，將這部「彈性女兒」，處理得格外精善，無疑的是一部駕輕就熟的傑作。</p>
<p>「彈性女兒」中的三個舞女，其一由路明擔任外，並由嚴月閒，朱秋痕客串演出，支配得很適當，餘如徐琴芳，馬陋芬，余光，秦桐，姜修，趙曼娜等，都是演技純熟，處於重要地位的角色，另外兩個男主角，則由徐　靈，石斧客串飾演，人材整齊，更使「彈性女兒」得到良好收穫。</p>
<p>「彈性女兒」中有兩支歌曲，「彈性女兒」「雙雙燕」，爲潘孑農作詞，晏如譜曲，詞句凄宛動聽，由路明單獨唱出，歌聲之悠揚，表情之深刻，廻顧中國影壇上，未嘗有過，况以描寫舞女爲中心題材的「彈性女兒」，在過去的國産片中尚未見過，是爲藝華最新出品的一部名貴電影，此片公映期近，勢必在轟動全滬舞壇，定有一番熱烈的盛况也。</p>
<h3>民新新聞</h3>
<p>「新人道」外景隊頃已出發揚州及淸江浦工作，一行有卜萬蒼，林楚楚，黎鏗，胡戎，王桂林，許坤武，黎錫，王天化，冷波，戴衍萬，熊淳，莊國鈞，林劍鳴，馬宗虎，顔慈等四十餘人，蓋此行在拍取黄沙萬里，餓莩遍地之偉大災景，連同在該地參加出演之臨時演員，爲數總在六七百人以上，所耗至少當在三千元以上。</p>
<p>爲中國影片作風獨創一格之「靈肉之門」，在各埠公演後。賣座成績鼎盛，故各處紛紛搶訂映權。聞現已印出拷貝十餘部，又該片再印一種拷貝於每句對白同時在畫面見字，使不懂國語之觀衆，可以隨聽隨看，完全了解云。</p>
<p>民新新聞部特派專員朱樹濤等赴四川攝取新聞影片，現已出發，因有此種不憚艱難之精神，故民新新聞片中方有多量之珍奇收獲也。</p>
<p>「神秘女探」爲以武功擅長之鄔麗珠女士及大力士彭飛所合演，該片導演任彭件對於每個鏡頭均在刺激緊張情况中攝上膠片。參照工作之人員，多爲對於偵探影片研究有素之人物，其成績之佳，可以斷言。</p>

<h3>一只汽缸的新型小汽車</h3>
<p>— 力</p>
<p>—兩匹半馬力—</p>
<p>上期本刊登載過一種英國出品的小型汽車照片——牌名呌“史科太”。這車子非常輕便。燃油也十分經濟。這種小汽車。可說是世界上英國出品小型汽車中最小的一種了。現在這車子居然在滬上發現。不是很的興味的麼。</p>
<p>據西報載稱上期四“武林”輪從漢口到上海。有兩位乘客霍爾格夫婦二人。帶來一輛最小的汽車。這汽車便是呌做“史科太”特號的。霍氏夫婦在上午到埠。便設法了一張捐照。於是這一輛最小型的汽車。載了他們二人由輪埠穿過英租界南京路直向華懋公寓進發。這時候正當中午交通繁忙的時候。這輛名符其實的小汽車。很覺盼顧自豪的在馬路上駛行。據車主霍爾格氏稱。他的小車子居然能和驅體岸然的大型車。並駕齊驅哩。</p>
<p>“史科太”的製造者。為英國一家造汽油船的公司。這種車子在經濟方面。可說得是數一數二的。馬達祇有一隻汽缸。馬力是兩匹半。這種引擎便是機器腳踏車中所用的。每小時最高速率為四十五英里。據說在英國駕較的時候。每加侖的汽油可走八十英里。這是和普通的機器腳踏車相仿的。所以這種小型汽車。眞可說是介於小汽車與附有邊車的機器腳踏車之間的。可是它的優點。旣沒有小汽車的開支大。又沒有機器腳踏車般的不舒服哩。</p>
<p>這種小汽車的經常開支旣如是的省㒢。可是目下所認為美中不足的。就是它的第一筆購買費用並不見得低廉。否則這車竟可名之為世界上四輪摩托車中最經濟的一種了。車主霍爾格現在希望在上海的熱鬧街市上。以每加侖汽油走六十英里為正常標準。在實際上。這車的最高速率似乎不能十二分高。可是在都市中用用也儘夠代步。况且它的加速等快速。卽使有高速度中轉灣時。也不致有翻車的危險呢。車中的引擎為空氣冷却式的一種。聽說製作非常卓越。</p>
<h3>一九三七年福特車身式樣</h3>
<p>福特汽車公司。最近加入特等俱樂部小轎車於一九三七年車身式樣之列。故可供選擇之車樣。實不一而足。此種新式車身式樣。對於凡欲購有小轎式車之專用。而有時須載乘二人以上者。最為合用。一九三七年福特V八類之車身式樣中。有五種可有特等或無特等之設備。此外尚的六種。均在特等范圍之中。</p>
<p>一九三七年福特車身式樣全表如下：各種具有六十匹馬力引擎之汽車。——二門轎车。二門旅行轎車。四門轎車。四門旅行轎車。反五窗小轎車。皆無特等設備。各種無特等設備之八十五匹馬力引擎之汽車。——二門轎車。四門轎車。二門旅行轎車。四門旅行轎車。及五窗小轎車。各種具有特等設備之八十五匹馬力引擎汽車——二門轎車。四門轎車。跑車蓬車。五窗小轎車。二門旅行轎車。四門旅行轎車。俱樂部小轎車。活頂轎車。活頂小轎車及俱樂部轎車。</p>
<h3>一九三七年特等福特跑車</h3>
<p>如圖為一九三七年特等福特V八四門跑車。前端飄逸雅麗。具有新式頭燈。V形玻璃屏風。以及一九三七年式特有之美麗綫度。此種新車。共有十一種特等車身。其中之五。並無特等設備。所謂特等式者。乃指裝有八十五匹馬力之引擎而言。其無特等設備者。則或裝六十匹馬力之引擎。或裝八十五匹馬力之引擎。悉聽購者之便。機械方面之改良諸點。則有指撥之駕駛駝。及動作輕易之安全車制。</p>
<h3>汽車瑣聞</h3>
<p>— 愚</p>
<p>▲第一百萬輛雪佛蘭　雪佛蘭汽車公司近在一年之間造成一百萬輛之汽車。此實為該公司歷史上未有之盛舉。此項一百萬輛汽車係包括所造之客軍故運貨車而言。一九三六年之第一百萬輛雪佛蘭。係在去冬完成於撥萊茅斯廠中。是時董事長克雷斯勒民親自在場。該公司以前所造之客車及運貨車之最高紀錄，為一九三五年之八四三，五九九輛。克雷斯勒氏為紀念此百萬輛之出品。曾云。此項紀綠之究成。可徵汽車製造業實為社會及經濟之要素。而仍在努力邁進中者也。二十年前。須集三百家之汽車公司出品。始能於一年間成就百萬輛之汽車數云。</p>
<p>▲美國公路建築費用　美國公路建築向極邁進。一九三六年之費用已達美金六○○，○○○，○○○元，此係美國造路協會所編制者。蓋自一九三一年以來。當以去年之造路工程最見進展也。聯邦經費。包括各種公路工程費及補助費等。約佔總數中之三○○，○○○○○○元，據聞一九三七年之造路費用，行將更見增益云。</p>
<p>▲醇與汽車肇禍關係　英醫士佛儂近在醫學研究會席上。發表關於酗酒與汽車肇禍之關係。略謂英國之汽車肇禍事件。兩年以來。其數雖未較一九三四年為增進。但平均致命者一日間尚有十八人。受傷者超過六百人。雖運輸部之統計稱。衹八十分之一為屬於醉後駕駛者。但由美國之統計視之。酗酒駕駛實佔肇禍重大原因之一。卽飲稍量之酒。亦受累不淺。其較願著者卽為於無知覺中增加其速率。如用威特麥克氏之試騐。於檢查血液或尿後。卽可由於所容酒精之成份。而互𪒕其症狀。無論何人如血中含有千分之一之酒精時。百分之四十至六十。卽受酒之作用。如含有一，七則百分之八十至八十八受其影響。如含有千分之一則全部受其影響矣。故佛氏之結論云。駕駛汽車者。務須掃除飲酒。</p>
<p>▲强賓火塞在英建廠　專製強賓發火塞之工廠現方在英起建。其全部工程費約為英金一○○，○○○鎊。廠基佔地止英畝。位置於倫敦附近之米達爾塞克斯地方。以前在美國發售之强賓發火塞。完全由溫沙地方之坎拿大强賓廠所製造。英國各種汽車以强賓發火塞作為標准装麗者。計有馬律斯，司坦達，亭堡，福特等。近來因各方殷需。於是决在英國建廠。新廠屋計一層高。廣三三，○○○方尺。所有各種製造及裝配機器咸係最新式者。可製各種汽車及飛機用之發火塞。</p>
<p>▲汽車競賽為牛敗興　最近由皇家東菲汽車協會所主持之汽車競賽。其全部行程為二千七百十五英里。加入之汽車計四十二輛。各車價值自英金一，○○○鎊以次不等。比賽時各駕駛者均有驚人之經歷。其中尤以第十一號之駕駛員惠司考為最不幸。因距離終點祇一百英里時。忽然發生意外之碰撞。而其已過之行程固已超過同儕者也。此時惠氏所遏司運命神乃為一牛。覓將其已在掌握中之勝利奪去。惠司考之車相撞後。車頭散熱器受損甚鉅。不得已停車裝換。而實責之時間乃為之損失不少。所可告慰者。惠民縱未獲冠軍。亞軍則仍舍公莫屬耳。</p>
<p>▲汽車上禁裝電視具　邇來汽車上裝設無綫電收音機者。實繁有徒。尤以美國此風為最盛。其原因一則為美國無綫電事業發達。二則為美人重娛樂。每當駕車外出。或作長途駛行。途中不致寂寞。實則車上裝置無綫電收音機。如於休泍假日。作郊外旅行。綠野如幕。音樂乍起。亦多清趣。否則於都布間短途駛行。偶一分心。反多意外耳。目下美國之好寄人士又擬將電視具裝置車上。此則於聆音之外。又可以目視。為娛樂許。自無不台。不過一班關心於交通安全者。深恐此風一張。後息無窮。良以駕駛汽車。務須手限並用。萬一駕駛者偶不經心。豈非巨禍立至。故大西洋城之國民安全會近已創有建議。禁在汽車上裝置電視具。其理由中有“母令梅蕙絲之玉影。得上銀幕。以致汽車肇禍。益難收拾”等語。亦可謂寓莊於諧者矣。</p>

<h3>Japanese Side Expresses Views on Wang Chonghui's Speech</h3>
<p>Acknowledges that the Aim of Foreign Minister Wang's Statement Aligns with Sato's Clarification, but the North China Problem Seems Difficult to Resolve Immediately</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui of China has made a statement on foreign policy that is extremely abstract, its content merely expressing fundamental principles of diplomacy such as mutual benefit, equality, and friendship. There has been no indication of specific policies for the future. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also criticizing Minister Wang's statement with extreme caution. The gist of Minister Wang's statement completely coincides with Foreign Minister Sato's clarification in the House of Peers: "Re-examining the policy toward China from an equal standpoint." Japan has no opposition to this principle and is willing to show sympathy, as an East Asian ally, for China's efforts to move toward national construction. However, the problem lies in how China will concretize this abstract principle. When China implements this principle, if the actual situation is not fully recognized from a political standpoint and a solution is studied based on current facts, then the efforts of both countries' authorities to establish Sino-Japanese peace will inevitably lead to opposition and could worsen Sino-Japanese relations more than the current state. In particular, regarding China's expectations of equality and mutual benefit, if they are aimed at gradually abolishing unequal treaties as China's national system becomes more complete, then the Japanese authorities should naturally respond to the negotiations and be prepared to present Japan's demands. However, if China's demands, as some people advocate, are to abolish the North China policy and other unrealistic and uninformed hard-line demands, then Foreign Minister Sato's efforts to bring the relations between the two countries back to normalcy will inevitably vanish and lose their effectiveness. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes that China will fully understand Foreign Minister Sato's true intentions, implement its foreign policy from a broad perspective, and not misjudge its progress or retreat. (Ninth Day, Allied Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] When Foreign Minister Sato gave a speech on foreign policy in the House of Peers, the newly appointed Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui also issued a statement on foreign policy in Nanjing. However, Minister Wang's statement was more abstract and simpler than Foreign Minister Sato's detailed reply, which gave the Japanese people an unexpected feeling. Minister Wang's statement was indeed aimed at Japan and can be interpreted as a response to Foreign Minister Hayashi Senjuro's diplomatic speech and Foreign Minister Sato's statement after assuming office. Combining the opinions of various aspects in Japan, Minister Wang first advocated the integration of national sentiments between the two countries, and secondly, he emphasized resolving diplomatic issues based on respect for sovereignty, equality, and mutual benefit. These are, of course, diplomatic remarks, and their spirit is also in line with Foreign Minister Sato's diplomatic speech on the 8th. The key lies in how honestly and realistically the two parties will implement their policies when handling specific issues in the future. In short, the new foreign ministers of China and Japan simultaneously issued statements with the same spirit, advocating mutual cooperation and efforts to stabilize East Asia. Therefore, it is naturally the responsibility of the authorities of both countries to discover methods of economic and political cooperation within this atmosphere. However, concerning the preservation of territorial integrity, if the Chinese side immediately demands the dissolution of the Eastern Hebei and Chahar governments according to their ideals, or adopts an attitude of denying the special nature of the "Manchukuo"-China-Japan contiguous region, then no matter how skillfully the foreign ministers of the two countries speak, it will ultimately amount to nothing more than words. Therefore, it is anticipated that Minister Wang will not adhere to this kind of abstract idealism in the future but will be able to see the big picture clearly and strive to implement practical policies. (Ninth Day, Allied Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] This morning, all newspapers here published the talk given by our new Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui to foreign journalists in the most important position. The Asahi Shimbun commented in its news column that Wang Chonghui's talk was directed at the speech given by Hayashi Senjuro in the Diet and Sato Naotake's remarks after taking office as Foreign Minister, considering this an important stance towards Japan. The Chinese Foreign Minister is preparing to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, which indeed contains important significance. Sato announced the same attitude in the House of Peers, and Wang made his statement only a few hours later. Although Wang's wording is abstract, a new path and agreement have already been discovered in the diplomatic stance of the two countries. Now that the two gentlemen have assumed the positions of foreign ministers in both countries and mutually acknowledge each other's positions, a new situation is developing and the stabilization of East Asia can be jointly achieved. The newspaper reveals the attitude of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, believing that under the current atmosphere, it is natural to seek various concrete plans for economic and political cooperation. However, regarding the point of maintaining territorial sovereignty, if China insists on abolishing the puppet organization of Eastern Hebei, Japan will still have to take decisive measures. Therefore, if China fully understands Japan's true intentions, it must deal with the situation skillfully, it is said. (Ninth Day, Central News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato Naotake's speech in the House of Peers yesterday, although there was no original manuscript, seems to have obtained the consent of Prime Minister Hayashi Senjuro, Army Minister Sugiyama Gen, and Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa. Ohkouchi's questions also seem to have been agreed upon in advance, providing Sato with the opportunity to give the speech. According to what is known here, the reactions from various countries have been excellent. The Soviet Union believes that it is a new measure by Japan towards China. However, judging from the psychology of authoritative figures here, although there is no objection to Sato's abstract talk on clarifying principles, regarding specific issues, such as abolishing the puppet organization of Eastern Hebei and returning the six counties of northern Chahar, not only have opinions against this been discovered, but some have even expressed strong opinions. Therefore, many existing difficulties cannot be resolved by merely discussing principles. Sato's plan for resolving specific problems is currently unknown, but if China's position is not given appropriate respect and Sato cannot find a way to resolve it reasonably, then the discussion of principles may ultimately become empty talk. However, the atmosphere here has greatly changed, and all those concerned about Sino-Japanese issues are eagerly awaiting Sato to put his words into action and restore Sino-Japanese relations to a normal path.

As for the development of Hainan Island, Shanghai will send a survey group to investigate plans, and it is hoped that the Hong Kong overseas Chinese will participate as a whole.

<h3>230,000 English Tons of Lu Salt to be Exported to Japan</h3>
<p>Contract Agreement to be Signed on the 11th; Japanese Occupation of Tanggu Salt Flats Withdrawn</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The eastern and western Tanggu salt flats, previously occupied by the Japanese military as salt production land, have had their barbed wire fences removed and been restored to their original condition through ongoing negotiations between the Standing Bureau [of the Tianjin Municipal Government] and the Japanese. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] An agreement on the export of Lu salt to Japan has been reached, and the signing is scheduled for 10:00 AM on the 11th at the Lu Salt Transport Office. The Hebei-Chahar Economic Council will send Commissioner Li Lulu to participate. The Chinese representatives for the signing will be Lu Salt Transport Commissioner Li Hanhua, Lu Feng Store Manager Shao Jingyin, and Salt Farm Representative Shao Ziqin. The Japanese representative will be Seino Tsunetaro, the Minister of Xingzhong Salt Industry. The total export volume is 230,000 English tons, with a price of 2.4 yuan per ton. The prices and procedures are the same as last year, except that Xingzhong will additionally provide a subsidy of 20,000 yuan to 90 salt farm households to avoid severe losses. Xingzhong plans to establish the Tanggu Transportation Company next month, after which transportation will begin, loading onto giant ships outside Dagu Port for shipment to Hokkaido to supply the Tokugawa Soda Company and Asahi Glass Company for the production of chemical salt. Xingzhong is still planning other methods regarding occupying Lu salt permanent benefits. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Japanese side has designated ten giant ships from the Dai Nippon Steamship Company and International Transportation Company for the Lu salt export transportation, divided into one or two batches of 100,000 tons each, and a third batch of 30,000 tons, to be transported to China in about four months. Li Hanhua returned to Tianjin from Peiping on the 9th to preside over the contract signing on the 11th. According to a salt farm owner in Changlu, the price of Lu salt is 2.4 yuan per ton, resulting in unbearable losses for the salt farm households. Only because Xingzhong took over the overseas export matters and did not want the mountain price to be higher than last year, did Li Sihao negotiate a subsidy of 20,000 yuan, which is not included in the contract. Salt farm households are requesting that the price be allowed to increase during the next salt purchase, but the Japanese side is unwilling. Of the more than 200 salt farm households in northern Changlu, over 100 have gone bankrupt due to losses over the years. There are currently 90 cases. The Japanese purchase of so much salt has created a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Various defunct salt farm households are applying to the Hebei Provincial Government for loans of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan to prepare for resumption of work, and are currently in consultation. Shao Jingyin, manager of the Lu Feng Store, stated that Lu salt has always used metric tons, each ton being 32 jin less than an English ton. The Japanese side insisted on using English tons for the salt they purchased, resulting in an invisible loss of approximately 32 jin per ton for the salt farm households. This point was negotiated several times without success, and the salt farm households had no choice but to sell at a loss. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Hong Kong] Three airships of the British Royal Air Force, flying from Singapore, intended to come here to participate in future major exercises. Midway, they encountered a major storm on the Lagaon Islands, approximately 18 miles southeast of Macau, and were forced to land. The British destroyer HMS Duke, and HMS Westminster, are currently sailing to assist them. In addition, sailors from four destroyers have been recalled to their ships to await orders. Naval authorities admit that if the three airships are damaged and drift with the waves, the destroyers currently docked here may be used, but there is not yet enough concern for the three airships. According to reports, a detachment of the Royal Air Force flying from Singapore, consisting of four airships, only one of which has safely arrived here. That airship, piloted by Air Force Commander Hotter, also encountered storms and docked on the coast of Lattron Island.

<h3>An Analysis of Sato's Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Since the peaceful resolution of the Xi'an Incident, Japan's perception of China has undergone considerable change. For example, Suma, the former Japanese Consul-General in Nanking, recently returned to Japan and praised our country's strength, saying that it was like the rising sun. Kodama, the leader of the Japanese observation group soon to visit China, also emphasized the need to look at China with new eyes. The diplomatic speech made by Sato, the new Japanese Foreign Minister, in the Diet on the 7th, was even rarer than anything since the September 18th Incident. In his speech, Sato stated that the diplomacy of a country should have continuity, but that anything unsuitable for the current situation should be changed. In Sato's view, Japan's previous diplomacy towards China did have aspects that could not adapt to the new developments, so he said, "The Sino-Japanese problem can only be solved if we change our methods and start anew." What is the new starting point that Sato mentioned? The main thing is to treat China as an equal and conduct negotiations. Sato said, "Negotiations between fully independent countries should be based on equal status." He also said, "We should let everything in the past flow away and conduct negotiations anew on an equal footing." The speech by Foreign Minister Sato is indeed one that has not been heard since [the September 18th Incident] and is worth paying close attention to.</p>
<p>However, after listening to the speech by the new Japanese Foreign Minister, we must point out that what Sato is asking to be changed is the method of Japan's negotiations with China, not the fundamental policy of Japan's diplomacy towards China. The fundamental policy of Japan's diplomacy towards China is the vigorous implementation of the continental policy. This continental policy will not be changed or abandoned unless it faces extreme obstacles. What Sato said about "a country's diplomacy should have continuity" refers to this point. Therefore, what the new Foreign Minister Sato advocates changing is the method of negotiating with China. This change in negotiating methods may solve some problems between the two countries, but the goals they seek to achieve are no different. This is what we should understand.</p>
<p>Why does Foreign Minister Sato advocate changing the attitude towards China? There are two important reasons. The first is that China's unification is becoming increasingly consolidated. All parties and factions are united under the grand goal of resisting foreign aggression by the central government, forming a huge force that makes it impossible for Japan to take whatever it wants as before. In particular, the peaceful resolution of the Two Guangxi Incident and the Xi'an Incident last year made it impossible for Japan to treat our country as a "non-modern country." Furthermore, the victory of the Suiyuan Resistance and the stalemate in the Sino-Japanese negotiations in Nanking made it impossible for Japan not to consider changing its past policies. The second is that the result of Japan's vigorous implementation of the continental policy in recent years has provoked serious international repercussions and has led to a position of international isolation. The conclusion of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany last year was intended to break this isolation, but the result was the opposite. Not only are all countries around the world paying attention to this agreement, but the people of Japan are also extremely dissatisfied, rising up to attack the government. In such a situation of international isolation, the Japanese government has no choice but to change its past attitude towards China. Because, as the new Foreign Minister said, "The fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese problem is the key to Japan's future diplomacy. The success or failure of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations will not only have a serious impact on Japan's relations with the Soviet Union but is also related to Britain and the United States. As for the so-called Pacific problem and disarmament problem, they are inseparable from the China problem. If the Sino-Japanese problem can be adjusted, then the friction between Japan and other powers can be greatly reduced. At the same time, Japan's credibility can also be improved." (See Sato's interview with reporters on the 7th)</p>
<p>Of the two reasons mentioned above, the former is more important than the latter. Because the consolidation of our country's unification enables us to adopt a strong policy of maintaining sovereignty and integrity against Japan, Japan will not make excessive demands, and the continental policy will not be successfully implemented. Therefore, the conflict between Japan and various countries over interests in the Far East will not be so serious. So, if we want to hope that Japan can change its past attitude towards China, then we must first support the central government, consolidate the unification, and adopt a strong policy that an independent country should have towards the outside world. If we do not do this and harbor extravagant hopes for Sato's diplomacy, we will be deceived. Because if they really have the determination to change their diplomacy towards China and treat us as an equal country, then they should respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, first abolish the illegal organizations in North China, and return the four northeastern provinces. Then come and negotiate the adjustment of diplomatic relations, economic cooperation, and a method of "coexistence and co-prosperity."</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi Expresses Satisfaction with Sato's Diplomatic Declaration</h3>
<p>Says the Stalemate in Sino-Japanese Negotiations Must be Broken; Anglo-Japanese Compromise Should Respect Chinese Interests</p>
<p>[London]</p>
<p>Reuters' representative today visited the Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi. Ambassador Guo expressed satisfaction with the speech given by the new Japanese Foreign Minister Sato in the House of Peers, in which he sympathized with China's desire for equality with other countries. He also stated that the stalemate in Sino-Japanese negotiations must be broken, but negotiations should be restarted based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. He said, "I feel that Sato's friendly gesture will surely elicit a normal response from Nanking. The appointment of Dr. Wang Chonghui as China's Foreign Minister and Sato's appointment as Japan's Foreign Minister were announced on the same day, which may be a good omen, as this may allow both sides to make a new start on new ideas regarding their mutual relationship. The result of Sato's speech may be beneficial to all countries that are concerned with peace and commerce in the Far East. China's efforts to be friendly with the powers are tireless, and it pays particular attention to its neighbors. It is proceeding with this on the basis of equality and reciprocity, so it will welcome any proposal for a friendly solution." Ambassador Guo continued to mention that the Japanese Foreign Minister is willing to rebuild friendship with Britain and eliminate the source of conflict in the Chinese market, saying that he is confident that China can only express satisfaction with this development. As for any compromise between Britain and Japan, it goes without saying that it will respect China's economic and political interests. Ambassador Guo finally stated that everything he said was his personal opinion. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>British Goodwill</h3>
<p>[London] The speech given yesterday by the new Japanese Foreign Minister Sato in the House of Peers has elicited a good impression here and in various circles related to the Far East, as well as in other circles. Generally, people believe that the Japanese government is now fully aware of the failure of its current policy towards China and will inevitably change its strategy sooner or later. Japan now seems willing to respect China's proposal to take the principle of equality as the basis for new negotiations to resolve the outstanding issues between China and Japan. It is also said that previous Japanese foreign ministers have often given similarly exciting speeches when taking office, but based on current phenomena, it is believed that this speech by Sato must have the full support of Prime Minister Hayashi and Army Minister Sugiyama. The political atmosphere in Tokyo seems to be firmly of the same opinion regarding Sato's ability to fulfill what he said. Furthermore, the new Foreign Minister seems to have the sympathy of the Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe. Ambassador Kawagoe once spoke out in favor of reorganizing Japan's policy towards China, and representatives of non-official influential circles related to Sino-Japanese economic relations have also expressed the same opinion. The British are deeply impressed by the friendly diplomacy used by the British to establish harmonious cooperation between China and Britain in South China in recent months.

<h3>American Reservation</h3>
<p>[Washington] After the new Japanese Foreign Minister Sato issued a declaration on foreign policy, American political figures have adopted a reserved attitude towards it. They said that the American government supports Foreign Minister Sato's proposal to improve relations between China and Japan, but it is feared that the true intention of Japan's change of attitude is to consolidate the understanding between Japan and Germany. Its main purpose seems to be to eliminate the danger of war between Japan and China, and to keep China neutral in any future war between Japan and Russia. This is what American diplomatic circles have said, that the Chinese government is currently planning to create national unity in order to resist Japan's threat, so Japan is taking the opportunity to propose the conclusion of a new treaty of friendship with China, so that China will not be influenced by Moscow.

<h3>Dongbao Commentary</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] After Foreign Minister Sato gave a speech on foreign policy in the House of Peers yesterday, only three newspapers, the Asahi Shimbun, the Yomiuri Shimbun, and the Miyako Shimbun, commented on it this morning. Regarding the point about diplomacy towards China, the Jiji Shimbun stated that, in principle, Foreign Minister Sato's view on diplomacy towards China should not be opposed. Sato has asserted that Japan's diplomacy towards China in the past few years has been a complete failure. Such a definite statement from the mouth of a diplomatic authority can be said to be a rare and frank confession. Unfortunately, this assertion should not only not be denied, but from our point of view, there is also a question: That is, has Japan ever had thorough diplomacy towards China in the past few years? The main reason for the current stalemate is that Japan has insisted on its own narrow point of view in its diplomacy towards China from beginning to end, and has neglected the need to observe the overall situation from the perspective of international relations. We have repeatedly stated that the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations is the cornerstone of Japan's entire foreign policy, and therefore it cannot be expected to succeed without cooperation with various countries concerned about China. Sato is a person who is most suitable for the work of re-examining the Sino-Japanese issue from a new starting point, as he has valuable experience in international diplomacy. The Yomiuri Shimbun commented that Foreign Minister Sato's remarks about starting anew, changing the way of thinking, and letting everything in the past flow away in preparation for resuming negotiations on an equal footing, should be regarded as a further step forward compared to what Prime Minister Hayashi said in the Diet before, that the people of the two countries should have contact with each other from time to time in order to substantially increase the approach and mutual assistance between China and Japan. It is unexpected that the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui also declared to reporters on the same day that international relations should be based on equality and mutual benefit, and that efforts should be made to increase friendship through peaceful means. These words are truly a good contrast. The simultaneous re-pointing out and re-declaration of the assertion of increasing friendship under the principle of equality and mutual benefit by the two foreign ministers of China and Japan made people feel refreshed, as if breathing fresh air. However, this alone should not be regarded as a sufficient guarantee to judge that the Sino-Japanese negotiations, which have encountered countless setbacks, can proceed smoothly. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the authorities of both countries will not ignore the true situation of the current situation, otherwise, the good air will unfortunately dissipate like mist.</p>
<p>The Miyako Shimbun reported that Foreign Minister Sato has been stationed abroad for a long time, and for this reason, he feels the need for a continuous sense of diplomacy. Although domestic sentiment is very important in determining the path of diplomacy, the situation of the other party should also be carefully considered. This is especially necessary in relation to China because the situation in China is complex and delicate. As for the opinion of changing the way of thinking from a new starting point, it is what we have always supported. (Central News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Parliament Focuses on the House of Peers</h3>
<p>Budget Bill Begins Deliberation</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Peers began deliberating on the government budget bill today, shifting the parliamentary focus to the House of Peers. The government is optimistic, as the budget bill passed smoothly through the House of Representatives, and believes that although there may be discussions in the House of Peers, the budget will ultimately be passed. However, with only seventeen days remaining in the parliamentary session, they intend to do their utmost to expedite the House of Peers' deliberation on the budget and, if necessary, implement a minimal extension of the session to ensure the budget bill is successfully enacted. (9th Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Today's House of Peers meeting commenced at 10:25 AM. With the budget bill transferred from the House of Representatives, the focus temporarily shifted to the House of Peers, creating a tense atmosphere in the chamber. The gallery was also filled to capacity. At the outset, Finance Minister Yuki requested and took the floor to explain the outline of the 12th fiscal year's general budget. His speech was similar to the financial address he gave in the House of Representatives. He stated that this revised budget had been approved by the House of Representatives as originally proposed, but as the budget bill was being submitted later than usual this year, he hoped that it would be reviewed and approved, given the shortened session. His speech lasted for thirty-five minutes. (9th Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Today, someone in the Japanese House of Peers raised an extremely absurd question that caused amusement. It is incomprehensible that such residual thinking still exists in today's world. An aged Doctor of Literature, Sanzji Mikami, currently a member of the House of Peers, suddenly questioned Foreign Minister Naotake Sato during today's meeting, asking why the Japanese government acknowledges the customary name "Republic of China." Mikami attempted to explain that the habitual use of the two characters "Zhonghua" (中華) implies contempt for countries other than China. Sato replied that the Cabinet meeting of 1930 decided that China should be referred to as "Republic of China" in official documents. Sato also said that each country's name is freely chosen by the country, and other countries cannot but recognize it. Furthermore, the term "Shina" (支那) does not necessarily imply contempt. Mikami then rose again to object to Sato's speech yesterday, saying that the Chinese people are too self-respecting to be treated as equals. (Central News Agency, 9th Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister of Commerce Explains Economic Relations with Manchukuo</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Today, in the House of Representatives' Export Guarantee Committee, Minister of Commerce Godo, in response to a question from Ichiro Miyamoto of the Seiyukai, clarified the government's policy on industrial and trade relations between Japan and Manchukuo as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ From Japan's perspective alone, the best approach would be to clearly define the division of industries between Japan and Manchukuo, with Manchukuo producing raw materials and Japan processing them. However, since Manchukuo is a firmly "independent state," it is inevitable that it will gradually develop processing industries, which is the root of Japan's headache. Therefore, for the future, Japan must prevent unfavorable competition and seek to adjust based on the consumption economies of both Japan and Manchukuo. Trade policies must also focus on this. ㊁ From the viewpoint of Japan-Manchukuo trade, the ideal situation would be to integrate the Japan-Manchukuo economic bloc and abolish tariffs. However, a special preferential tariff treaty between Japan and Manchukuo should not be easily implemented and should be carefully considered. ㊂ In the future, the Manchukuo market cannot be considered immune to competition between Japan and China. However, considering the special circumstances between Japan and Manchukuo, there is no reason for anything particularly unfavorable to Japan, as Manchukuo's new industries are all established with Japanese capital. ㊃ To prevent economic competition between Japan and China in Manchukuo, it would be inappropriate to establish a special agreement between Japan and Manchukuo. In reality, Manchukuo's industrial plans and funds are all created by Japan. If such Manchukuo were threatened by China, it would be a great disgrace to our national industry. Furthermore, I believe it is unacceptable to attempt to expel Chinese economic power from Manchukuo. (9th Kokumin Telegram)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Raw Materials Conference: British Representative States Opinions</h3>
<p>Opposes Open Door Policy in Colonies, Prepares to Encourage Raw Material Production, Japanese Representative Advocates Freedom of Immigration</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations recently convened a conference to study the issue of equal commercial opportunities for all countries regarding certain raw materials. Sixteen countries participated, including Japan, although it is not a member of the League of Nations, while Germany and Italy had no representatives present. The conference opened today with an opening address by League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, who stated that the participants do not fully represent their national governments and can freely express their opinions. The meeting will be held in private, and only summaries of the proceedings will be published. (Central News Agency, 8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Subsequently, the representatives of Great Britain and Japan delivered speeches. The British representative, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross (the government's economic advisor who previously came to China to investigate financial and economic conditions), claimed that he was expressing his personal views, but well-informed sources believe that what he presented was, in fact, the British government's perspective. Leith-Ross stated, "If we want to transfer the colonies belonging to various countries in order to solve the difficulty of raw materials, even if all the colonies on the continent are transferred, it may not be effective, and some countries may not be able to be self-sufficient in raw materials. In order to solve the problem of raw materials, the British government is prepared to encourage the production of various raw materials in its colonies. Even if a certain raw material is only needed by foreign countries and is useless to Britain, we should try to increase its output, but apart from this, Britain does not want to do anything more. Furthermore, adopting an open-door policy in the colonies of various countries often hinders the development of colonial enterprises and is detrimental to the welfare of the indigenous people. Many countries, on the one hand, advocate an open-door policy, while on the other hand, adopt completely opposite policies, such as hindering the development of international trade and maintaining currency exchange rates by artificial means. How self-contradictory is this? The reason why many countries lack raw materials is because these countries have implemented inappropriate fiscal and economic policies at home. Among them, the system of limiting import quotas is the most inappropriate. The burden of manufacturing artificial raw materials to replace natural raw materials on the national economy is actually greater than purchasing raw materials from foreign countries. The result of the implementation of such policies only serves to lower the living standards of the people." Leith-Ross also believed that the note drafted by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on the issue of raw materials did not mention the issue of food, which is regrettable, because the problem of food supply is even more important than the problem of industrial production. Leith-Ross further advocated compiling statistics on the production, consumption, and prices of raw materials and establishing a small committee for each raw material, with representatives from the major importing and exporting countries of that raw material serving as members.</p>
<p>The Japanese representative, Shuto, the commercial counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Germany, then delivered a speech, generally advocating the abolition of various restrictions on the export of raw materials. In all undeveloped colonies, freedom of immigration should be universally permitted, and no restrictions should be imposed regardless of the nationality or race of the immigrants. The current system in the Congo of Africa should be followed in all undeveloped colonies. Shuto also said that the two issues of free trade and raw material distribution cannot be separated. As far as Japan is concerned, the supply of raw materials for industrial use is related to Japan's survival and is extremely important, but merely using various methods to facilitate the import of raw materials into Japan is not enough to solve the current difficulties. It is also necessary to take various measures to facilitate international trade in industrial manufactured goods. (Central News Agency, 8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>German Ambassador to Britain Scheduled to Return to Post Today</h3>
<p>Carrying New Instructions</p>
<p>[Berlin] German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop, who recently returned to Germany to attend the Leipzig City Fair, is now scheduled to return to London this Wednesday.

<h3>Important Speech by British Foreign Secretary Eden</h3>
<p>Does Not Believe a Major War is Unavoidable, Praises American Peace Efforts</p>
<p>[London] In a speech delivered at Albetinge last night, Foreign Secretary Eden stated that the large-scale arms buildup by various countries should not lead to the conclusion that a world war is inevitable. The British government will not endorse such a fatalistic doctrine, and those who work for peace are truly numerous and diverse in their methods. Many are aware that once a war breaks out, both the victors and the vanquished will suffer immeasurable disasters that cannot be avoided. This alone is enough to make ambitious individuals cautious and prevent them from acting rashly. Eden continued by saying that the United States is a great protagonist in stabilizing peace. Looking at the current state of turmoil in the world, one thing is comforting: that in the large area where the American flag is displayed, there are those who love peace and strive for progress, engaged in great work.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary continued, saying that foreign affairs will be one of the main issues discussed at the upcoming Imperial Conference. The value of a free exchange of views on this issue by the various departments of the British government at this time cannot be overestimated. The British government intends to present all the facts openly and fully at the meeting and will strive to reach a compromise in a direction that contributes to the prosperity of the various departments of the British Empire and world peace. The British government firmly believes that a rearmament program is beneficial to peace and is indisputable. If necessary, it intends to implement it thoroughly, but the British government will seize the first opportunity to curb the evil forces of increased armaments, and will never miss the opportunity to establish international agreements to promote trade and international relations.

<h3>Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War Passes Oversight Plan</h3>
<p>Includes Declaration and Attachments, Maritime Surveillance to Begin Saturday</p>
<p>[London] The Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War held a plenary session this afternoon. After a lengthy discussion, the committee finally passed a plan for the surveillance of Spanish land and sea borders. Representatives of Great Britain, France, Germany, and Italy immediately announced that their respective governments were prepared to implement the maritime surveillance plan starting on the 13th of this month. In addition, the Non-Intervention Committee also passed a proposal by the French representative to include representatives from three other signatory countries to the non-intervention agreement, in addition to the representatives from Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia, in the London headquarters responsible for implementing the surveillance plan. The Non-Intervention Committee then passed a resolution on future work, arguing that: ㊀ the issue of expanding the scope of the Non-Intervention Agreement should be studied. "Expanding" refers to prohibiting not only the direct intervention acts of shipping arms to Spain and sending volunteers to Spain, but also various indirect intervention acts, such as providing financial support to both sides of the civil war and sending individuals of Spanish nationality to Spain to engage in activities that prolong the civil war or increase the conflict. ㊁ various methods should be drafted as soon as possible to ensure that all foreign individuals who directly or indirectly participate in the civil war within Spain are forced to withdraw. Finally, the Non-Intervention Committee resolved the difficulties that arose in Germany regarding surveillance expenses. According to the surveillance budget of £1 million, Germany is responsible for over £140,000, but due to the country's lack of foreign currency, the Non-Intervention Committee agreed to have the country pay £10,000 first, with the remaining amount to be paid in foreign currency, and the payment method will be determined later.

<p>[London] Regarding the plan for land border surveillance in Spain, the implementation process, as generally understood, will be divided into three steps: ㊀ appointing main supervisors to begin performing their duties; ㊁ appointing lower-level personnel; ㊂ each of these personnel performing their duties. As for the distribution of supervisors, in addition to the 130 British inspectors dispatched along the border between Portugal and Spain, 130 international inspectors will be stationed in the Pyrenees Mountains, i.e., the border between France and Spain, and five will be stationed at the border between the British territory of Gibraltar and Spain. There will also be a total of 550 naval supervisors. Regarding the issue of the Spanish Canary Islands, i.e., the ships of the countries participating in the non-intervention agreement traveling from the Americas to Spain should dock in the ports of the Canary Islands to be inspected, there are currently differences of opinion among the countries concerned, and it will be resolved at a later date. (Central News Agency, 8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The land and sea border surveillance plan passed by the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War yesterday includes a declaration and one attachment each. The declaration states that: ㊀ after the Non-Intervention Committee passed a resolution on the 16th of last month to prohibit volunteers from participating countries from going to Spain, the governments of the member countries have recently decided to expand the scope to include non-Spanish nationals who are recruited or transit in these countries, or who depart from these countries to Spain to aid the civil war, and prohibit them as well. ㊁ The member countries believe that establishing a border inspection system on the Spanish land border to examine the implementation of the Non-Intervention Agreement is beneficial. ㊂ The Portuguese government invited the British government to dispatch inspectors to the border area between Portugal and Spain to inspect the implementation of the agreement, and the British government has accepted this invitation and will treat these inspectors as personnel attached to the British Embassy in Portugal. ㊃ The British government notified the committee that after the above measures were established, the country's inspectors could carry out their duties. ㊄ The member countries firmly believe that the British government, in cooperation with Portugal, will be able to complete its mission, and therefore decided to implement surveillance measures in accordance with the annex in the border area between Spain and France, the border area between Spain and the British territory of Gibraltar, and the Spanish coast and territories, until an amendment or other resolution is passed at a later date. The declaration also stated that the four countries, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, have stated to the committee that they will begin zonal surveillance of Spanish waters on the 13th of this month.</p>
<p>The attachment is divided into seven sections: ㊀ The surveillance measures and the organization of the London headquarters; ㊁ Special surveillance measures for the Spanish land border; ㊂ Surveillance measures for ships belonging to countries participating in the Non-Intervention Agreement traveling to Spain, but surveillance measures for ships belonging to these countries coming from the Americas and required to anchor in the ports of the Canary Islands will be discussed separately; ㊃ The zonal surveillance measures by warships of Great Britain, France, Germany, and Italy along the coast and territories of mainland Spain. This coastline is approximately 10,000 nautical miles long, and the warships of each country should fly their national flag; ㊄ Inspectors from various countries should implement surveillance measures in a gradual process; ㊅ The total surveillance cost is £834,000, to be amortized over twelve months. Participating countries should allocate funds to the headquarters according to the ratio set by the headquarters. This ratio may be revised to be fair. Of these, the expenses required for the surveillance measures at the border between Portugal and Spain should be borne 80% by the United Kingdom and 20% by Portugal. The expenses required in Spanish waters should be borne by the countries responsible for surveillance, i.e., Great Britain, France, Germany, and Italy; ㊆ The date of establishment of the headquarters (i.e., March 8th).

<h3>Spanish Government Cargo Ship Sunk</h3>
<p>Transferred Cargo Mid-Voyage, Arms Not Lost</p>
<p>[London] The Spanish ship "Mar Cantabrico" (2,518 tons) was bombarded and sunk today by the Nationalist cruiser "Canarias" in the Bay of Biscay. The British Admiralty issued a statement tonight claiming that four British destroyers responded to the ship's SOS signal and sailed to rescue it. The HMS Echo received a telegram from the Canarias stating that the ship's crew had been rescued and boarded the ship, which proves that the ship has indeed sunk. The Nationalist forces were overjoyed at the sinking of the ship, as it was carrying $3.5 million worth of arms for the Spanish government. It quietly sailed out of New York Harbor a few hours before the U.S. Congress passed a law prohibiting the shipment of war materiel to Spain. The U.S. Coast Guard tried to chase it but failed. Since January 1st of this year, the Nationalist forces had vowed to capture it. On January 21st, it was reported that the ship had arrived in Veracruz, but then no trace of it was found. Nationalist warships had been patrolling the coast closely to prevent the unloading of its cargo. It is now believed that the ship had not had time to unload its cargo before it was attacked. (Central News Agency, 8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Sources within the Spanish government said here today that "the arms carried by the cargo ship 'Mar Cantabrico' were not lost. Before the ship set sail from the United States, it was anticipated that the rebel forces would intercept it, so it was planned to transfer the arms to another ship mid-voyage and sail directly to a port under the control of the Spanish government forces. The 'Mar Cantabrico' then continued on its original route to deceive the enemy." (9th Kokumin Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] It is learned that the Spanish ship "Mar Cantabrico," which was sunk yesterday in the Bay of Biscay by a Spanish Nationalist cruiser, was a 6,000-ton vessel that sailed from New York Harbor on January 6th. The ship was carrying a large quantity of war materiel, including eight aircraft and thirty-two field guns, all for the Spanish government. (Central News Agency, 9th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Saint John of Luz: The Spanish government forces learned today of the sinking of the cargo ship "Mar Cantabrico" and were greatly alarmed, as the arms it carried were urgently needed. Madrid originally planned to launch a counter-offensive against the rebel forces as soon as it received these arms, in order to clear the enemy traces in the suburbs of the capital. Now that it has all vanished, this plan will naturally suffer a major setback. It is not known whether Madrid will be able to hold out. (9th Kokumin Telegram)</p>

<p>According to Reuters' New York correspondent, although the Spanish merchant ship "Mar Cantabrico" failed to pass through the blockade of the Spanish Nationalist coast, the government forces' embassy in Mexico City still plans to continue shipping arms and food to Spain. The Mexican government is currently cooperating, and the Spanish merchant ship "Motormar" is now loading military supplies, preparing to set sail. (Central News Agency, 9th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Atrocious Behavior of Italian Troops Stationed in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Part of the Information Verified. Undersecretary of State Answers Member's Question</p>
<p>[London] During today's session of the House of Commons, several members inquired about the events of February 19 in Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia, when an assassination attempt was made on Italian Governor-General Graziani. In his response, Undersecretary Cranborne implicitly acknowledged the massacre perpetrated by the Italian authorities after the incident. He stated, "While it is difficult to obtain accurate details, it is generally known that after the incident, Addis Ababa experienced great turmoil. Italian soldiers took the opportunity to engage in severe acts of retaliation, resulting in many Abyssinian deaths and significant property damage. I am pleased to inform you that British citizens and those under British protection who were arrested after the incident have been released after the acting British Consul-General's negotiations with the Italian authorities. No British citizens died in this case." Labor MP Fletcher asked the Undersecretary to note that eyewitnesses claimed the Italian soldiers' retaliatory actions were indescribably barbaric and the most brutal act seen in Africa since the Congo massacre. The Undersecretary replied, "I have seen this report. I say with a heavy heart that part of the information received by the Foreign Office has been verified."

<h3>A Certain Military Officer Flies to North Chahar to Inspect Puppet Troops</h3>
<p>And Inspects an Armament Factory Established by a Certain Party. Li Shouxin's Force's Equipment Transported Back Outside the Great Wall</p>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence: After the puppet troops in North Chahar and Jehol, following the orders of a certain military headquarters, withdrew to their original defense positions in Jehol Province before March 1, military actions have temporarily come to an end. It is said that the important task of the puppet troops' withdrawal is to expand training. Recently, in order to understand the actual training situation after the reorganization of the Mongolian puppet troops, a certain military headquarters sent three officers who flew from Changchun to Gongbei on a military plane at 4 PM on the 5th of this month. Kuwahara, the head of the Zhangbei Special Affairs Agency, and Li Shouxin, the puppet deputy commander, who had originally gone to the Xiqide Wang Mansion to offer condolences on the 4th of this month, rushed to Zhangbei by car at noon on the 5th after receiving the news and went to the airport outside the East Gate to welcome them. After the officers got off the plane, they went to the Special Affairs Agency in the city to rest. Then, accompanied by Kuwahara and Li Shouxin, they inspected the armament factory established by a certain party inside the East Gate. It is said that the officers will inspect each of the puppet troops separately starting from the 6th and will stay for several days before returning.</p>
<p>The mother of De Wang was buried on the 5th. Many people from all sides went to the West Sunite Banner to offer condolences. De Wang usually served his mother with filial piety and was known for it. He was overwhelmed with grief and became ill. According to De Wang's original intention, he planned to stay in the West Banner to guard his mother's tomb and recuperate, but because a certain party urged him so urgently that it could not be delayed, De Wang sent a telegram to the Jia Bu Temple puppet government on the evening of the 5th, saying that he had decided to return to the temple in the next few days.</p>
<p>Six tanks and ten airplanes, which a certain party had previously issued to Li Shouxin's force, were originally parked in Zhangbei and were all transported back outside the Great Wall on the 5th. The types of aircraft included four fighter planes, four bomber planes, and two reconnaissance planes. One of the bomber planes had been shot down by our army and was severely damaged.</p>
<p>In addition, Wu Heling, a confidant of De Wang, went to Changchun on the orders of De Wang to discuss the Zhangbei puppet organization with a certain military headquarters. Currently, the chief of staff of a certain military headquarters, Itagaki, has been transferred, and the new person has not yet arrived, so Wu is still staying in Changchun. (6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Establish Asia Association Xiamen Branch</h3>
<p>Noteworthy Internal Organization: Has a Special Committee and an Inland Department</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: When Japanese General Matsui traveled to Fujian and Guangdong two years ago and passed through Xiamen, he advocated the establishment of the "Greater Asia Association Xiamen Branch" in Xiamen. At that time, Japanese and Taiwanese residents in Xiamen had an organizing committee, but it was never formally announced. According to recent news, the "Greater Asia Association Xiamen Branch" has been established at the Kashiwabara Hotel opened by the Japanese in Gulangyu. Most of the members are Japanese and Taiwanese in Xiamen, and Yan Jinniu and others from the Tenth Army in the inland of Fujian Province have also participated. The association's internal organization has a "Special Committee" in addition to the board of directors, which is divided into five departments: General Affairs, Organization, Publicity, Public Relations, and Inland, each with selected personnel responsible for handling affairs. The association's stated purpose is to promote the unity of Asian ethnic groups to seek co-existence and co-prosperity and to maintain goodwill and peace forever. Since its establishment, it has held several board meetings. The fact that its organization includes a Special Committee and an Inland Department seems to require close attention. (March 7)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Shantou Quarantine Station's Maltreatment of Compatriots Going Abroad</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Organizations' Appeals for Relief Are Ineffective. The Quarantine Station Has Recently Become Even More Aggravated</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Every month, tens of thousands of compatriots from Chaozhou and Meizhou counties go to Shantou to go abroad for a living. Wang Gongchen, the director of the Shantou Quarantine Station, previously stipulated that each person going abroad would be charged a quarantine fee of one silver dollar. Overseas Chinese organizations and associations in various ports believed that this practice was an egregious example and sent telegrams to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Nanjing, requesting its cancellation, but to no avail. Therefore, those who go abroad cannot board the ship without a quarantine certificate. However, even those with quarantine certificates are still subject to examination by doctors from the local immigration office after arriving in Siam, proving that the Shantou quarantine is of absolutely no benefit to compatriots in the Shan State. It was found that last month, 51 people were refused disembarkation by the Siamese side, who called it measles and ordered them to return home. Therefore, the compatriots going abroad are extremely dissatisfied with the quarantine station. The Shantou Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society has telegraphed the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission again, requesting an improvement, but the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has not yet provided a satisfactory response. Unexpectedly, the quarantine station has issued a new rule that in addition to paying a fee of one dollar, two personal photos must be attached to the quarantine certificate, and the photos must be taken at a designated photo studio of the quarantine station in order to be valid. The cost of photography is particularly expensive and cannot be done in a short time. Those going abroad and organizations such as the travel industry association strongly opposed it, but it was still ineffective. The quarantine station began implementing the new rule on March 1. On the 2nd, two British ships, Guiyang and Harris, sailed to Siam, carrying more than 2,500 passengers going abroad. Because they did not have time to take photos, each person asked the quarantine station for leniency, but the quarantine station ignored them, causing great anger among the passengers, who roared loudly and shouted "Long live the Republic of China!" Unexpectedly, the quarantine station staff suddenly pulled out guns to intimidate them. As the ship was about to depart, the passengers boarded the ship one after another. The staff member, on the order of the director of the quarantine station, boarded the ship to negotiate with the captains of the two ships, ordered more than 2,000 people going abroad to be hoisted ashore, all luggage was unloaded, and ordered the two ships to postpone their departure, causing the passengers going abroad to be in a terrible situation. The shipping company immediately reported the situation to the British Consul in Shantou. The British Consul only shook his head and sighed and interceded with the quarantine station, but it was still ineffective. The Shantou Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, the Travel Industry Association, and other organizations turned to the Shantou Municipal Government to petition and negotiated with the quarantine station, but it was ultimately ineffective. On the morning of the 3rd, the shipping company again pleaded with the British Consul to negotiate with the municipal government, and it was finally allowed to re-board the ship, but more than 200 people were unable to take photos and returned to their hotels. On the 4th, various organizations in Shantou telegraphed the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, reporting the details of the case and requesting that the resolutions on protecting overseas Chinese be earnestly implemented, and that the loving care for overseas Chinese repeatedly emphasized be taken seriously. The organizations also presented petitions to the Administrative Office, the Municipal Government, and other agencies, requesting that they earnestly assist overseas Chinese going abroad. The words of the petitions were sincere, but it is not known what the effect will be.</p>
<h3>Fujian Province's Unified Control of Black Tea Production and Sales Has Been Realized</h3>
<p>Joint Sales Office Has Been Established. The Sales of Fujian Fir Wood Are Also Gradually Improving</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Last year, the black tea produced in eastern and northern Fujian Province sold well in the north and Southeast Asia, and tea merchants made a slight profit. This year, in order to promote foreign trade, the Construction Department decided to implement unified control of production and sales. The Fuzhou Export Black Tea Joint Sales Office was established by the department, with a capital of 800,000 yuan, of which 200,000 yuan was subscribed by tea firms as fixed capital, and 600,000 yuan was borrowed from banks by the Construction Department as working capital. From now on, the province's black tea export trade will be handled by the office. Tea firms are only responsible for purchasing tea leaves in the inland, baking, and decorating them, and then handing them over to the joint office for export. Tea firms that do not join the joint office are not allowed to engage in the export tea business. After this method was promulgated, the tea firms believed that it would hinder business development and unanimously opposed it and refused to join. Subsequently, Guan Zhongle, a counselor of the provincial government dispatched by the Construction Department, and Luo Mianhou, the chairman of the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce, convened representatives of various tea firms for several consultations, exchanged views with each other, and approved five supplementary methods from the business side. The tea firms were satisfied and agreed to join. The Fuzhou Export Black Tea Joint Sales Office has been organized and established. The office is located in the former Southeast Bank on Nan Tai Da Ling Ding. Guan Zhongle has been appointed by the Construction Department as the manager, and Luo Mianhou and Wu Shaohua have been elected by the tea firms as co-managers. A review committee has also been established, with representatives of the tea firms serving as review members. It is said that the joint sales office has established standards for the quality and decoration of exported black tea. Those that do not meet the standards are not allowed to be exported, in order to increase the value of Fujian tea and restore its reputation.</p>
<p>In addition, the fir wood produced in western and northern Fujian Province sold well last year because American pine wood was not exported and Taiwan timber harvesting was stopped. Therefore, timber merchants from Tianjin and Taiwan purchased from Fuzhou. The prices of all wooden sticks and wood chips have increased. This year, sales in North China are still not bad, but sales in Zhejiang and the Yangtze River area are extremely sluggish. Therefore, there are not many wooden rafts transported from northern Fujian to Fuzhou since the new year. However, recently, it has been rumored that a certain country has contacted this province to order a large number of fir wood for construction purposes. However, according to the timber industry, nothing has been heard of it. (March 6)</p>
<h3>Jiading: Unified Sale of Grass Products</h3>
<p>A special handicraft industry in the eastern rural areas of this county uses yellow grass to weave slippers, sandals, cup sleeves, handbags, schoolbags, wallets, document holders, etc., which are sold in the country, Southeast Asia, the United States, and other places, with annual sales reaching more than 600,000 yuan. The Economic Construction Movement Branch of this county believes that merchants are mutually squeezing each other, indiscriminately collecting inferior goods, and manufacturers are therefore producing crudely and abusing materials, resulting in poor exports, affecting sales, and the failure is worrying. After collecting opinions from all parties, it is proposed that a sales cooperative be jointly established by the sales and manufacturing parties, and the Jiading Grass Products Unified Control Committee be organized by the branch to seek rectification and improvement. Before the cooperative is organized, the Zhongfan Grass Weaving Factory Co., Ltd. will be organized by the merchants, with a fixed capital of 100,000 yuan, which has been fully paid. The opening ceremony was held in Xuhang Town in October. The county government approved the exclusive operation for five years</p>

It is scheduled to review them in three phases on the 13th, 17th, and 23rd of this month. On the one hand, the county government ordered the various districts to quickly send the list of township and town Baos and Chiefs who have been re-elected to the county for review. After passing the review, it will be formally announced, so that they can be sent to the provincial district for training in batches in April, and all can be completed this month.</p>

<h3>Summary of Bandit News in the Four Townships</h3>
<p>The Zhang San family in Xujiang Township was visited by more than ten bandits the night before last, who wantonly robbed and burned the legs of the homeowner, causing a loss of about 100 yuan.

He immediately sent police to capture the bandit leader, who confessed. He was sent to the headquarters for interrogation on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Rice Prices Rebound and Change Direction</h3>
<p>The local rice market, after the resumption of trading after the Lunar New Year, had few arrivals, and several newly opened rice mills wanted to purchase, so the market price increased daily. In the past half month, the sales were not good, and the market price has continued to decline, falling by nearly one yuan compared to the end of last year, and the Maan rice has also fallen by about five corners. Yesterday, there was a slight turnaround, and there is no fear of further decline.

<h3>Zhenjiang: Armed Clashes Erupt During Anti-Smuggling Operations</h3>
<p>Sun Xu, the captain of the tax anti-smuggling team stationed in Jinshanhe, received a tip yesterday that Bian Jinfay's family, residents of Yongdong Township in the county, hid several packages of smuggled salt from the Shouzhou gang in Anhui Province, secretly planning to transport and sell them. After receiving the tip, Captain Sun sent several armed police officers to search around midnight the night before last. However, Bian had received the news in advance and moved the smuggled goods elsewhere. When the anti-smuggling police officers arrived, they searched for half an hour without finding anything. Bian's attitude became tough because the team did not find any smuggled goods, and a conflict broke out with the team's investigating personnel. Before long, many traffickers from the Shouzhou gang heard the news and rushed to the scene. At first, there was a verbal conflict between the team members and the police officers, then they took action, wielding sticks and throwing stones. More and more participants gathered. Seeing the situation was not good, the team feared they would be outnumbered and opened fire, causing a major disturbance. About a dozen people were injured on both sides. The Zhenjiang County Government was informed afterward and immediately sent police to suppress the situation and sent the perpetrators to the county for interrogation yesterday morning. It is unknown how they will be dealt with.</p>

<h3>Lectures for Overseas Chinese School Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>To be Held in Beijing on the 15th of this Month</p>
<p>Penang Members to Arrive in Shanghai on the 14th</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Chunpu, Director of the Overseas Chinese Education Department of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, was ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the late month of the 24th year of the Republic to go to Nanyang to investigate commercial and overseas Chinese affairs and to investigate local consulates. When he passed through Penang in mid-April, Principal Chen Guang'en of Chung Ling High School, the highest Chinese school in British Malaya, organized all the Chinese school teachers and staff in Penang to host a banquet for Director Chen at the Shanghai Hotel. During the banquet, Principal Chen instructed Mr. Qian Jingcheng, a teacher at the school, to appeal to Director Chen to suggest to the central government to allocate funds to assist administrative personnel of overseas Chinese schools to return to the country to study education, so as to reform overseas Chinese education. Director Chen deeply appreciated this suggestion. After Chen completed his official duties and returned to Beijing, he drafted an implementation outline and submitted it to the central government for adoption. After a considerable period of time, the case was approved by the Executive Yuan. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission originally planned to implement it in November of last year, but due to the winter season, overseas Chinese school teachers and staff, who had lived in Nanyang for a long time, were not suitable for this climate. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission immediately announced that it would be postponed to March 15th of this year (the lecture and investigation time were each set for one month). All overseas Chinese schools in British, Dutch, Siamese, Burmese, and Philippine Islands were allowed to send students to participate in the lectures (a fixed number of 50). They would also visit Nanjing, Qingdao, Beijing, Wuxi, Suzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places to investigate education. All travel expenses would be borne by the overseas Chinese schools themselves, and all expenses for transportation, food, and lodging during the lectures and investigations would be provided by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. According to reliable sources, the Penang side has already nominated Principal Chen Guang'en of Chung Ling High School, Principal Zhu Yuehua of Fujian Women's School, and Principal Xu Mingzhi of Jixiao Overseas Chinese School to join the association through Consul Huang Yankai, the consul stationed in Penang. In addition, those who joined the lecture at their own expense and accompanied the investigation included Mr. Liu Weimin and Mr. Wen Jicheng, representatives of the board of directors of Chung Ling High School, Fujian Women's School, and Lizexue School, and Principal Su Bingzhang of Lizexue School. Each of these members is scheduled to leave Penang for Singapore on the 5th of this month, and take the German post ship Soharnorst via the Philippines back to China on the 7th. They are scheduled to arrive here on the 14th and take the Beijing-Shanghai train to Beijing to report.</p>

<p>6. Experimentation and Research</p>
<p>Experimentation is an important task of the school. The experimental work carried out by the school can be briefly described in two aspects as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Comparative Experimentation of Teaching Problems: Conducted in four steps:</p>
<p>(1) Preparation Period: The first step is theoretical preparation, such as reading education experimental methods; the second step is methodological preparation, such as selecting experimental problems and determining experimental methods; the third step is tool preparation, such as editing experimental materials and tests.</p>
<p>(2) Experimentation Period: Such as testing, grouping, preliminary testing, experimentation, retesting, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Calculation Period: Such as calculating progress and regression numbers, winning points, experimental coefficients, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Reporting Period: Such as compiling reports, printing, etc.</p>
<p>Experiments that have already yielded results include:</p>
<p>(1) A comparative experiment on the use of the circular method and the direct method in arranging fraction teaching materials. The results indicate that the circular method is more suitable.</p>
<p>(2) A comparative experiment on explaining stroke order and not explaining stroke order in writing instruction. The results indicate that explaining stroke order is more suitable.</p>
<p>(3) A comparative experiment on the problem of composition correction. The results indicate that correction is more suitable.</p>
<p>(4) A comparative experiment on the teaching methods of principles and theories in arithmetic. The results indicate that the inductive method is more suitable.</p>
<p>(5) A comparative experiment on the problem of memorizing short modern vernacular texts. The results indicate that memorization is more suitable.</p>
<p>Detailed reports are available in special volumes for the above five experiments. The results of other small-problem experiments have been compiled into the first report of small-problem experiments, the second report, and a preliminary compilation of the school's small-problem results, with summaries.</p>
<p>From the 23rd year of the Republic, the five Jiangsu Provincial Experimental Primary Schools, in order to improve the efficiency of experimental education and concentrate the experimental efforts of each school, jointly organized an Experimental Research Committee to coordinate experimental research matters, to notify each other of the determination of experimental problems, and to compile and report to the Department of Education by the Committee, so as to avoid duplication of experimental problems and waste of experimental efforts. This method has been tried for two years and has been quite effective.</p>
<p>In the first Experimental Research Committee of the 24th year of the Republic, in order to further concentrate experimental efforts and enhance the accuracy of experiments, a principle was established to jointly experiment on a number of problems, so that each problem would have experimental results from five schools, which could be mutually verified and further improve the reliability of accuracy. Among the common experimental problems, two were experimented on in the first semester of the 25th year of the Republic, namely:</p>

<p>Yarn Market Returns to Favorable Condition</p>
<p>Tianjin Traders Actively Buying Spot Yarn</p>
<p>Short Covering Begins</p>
<p>Far-Term Sentiment Becomes More Positive</p>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and strong in the afternoon, and the situation did not deviate from the overall fluctuation trend. However, most targets were bearish, anticipating that yarn mill output would gradually increase, and there were still many people who sold off on rallies, so the pressure was heavy. Most of the former supporters of Indian merchants have already turned from long to short. There are rumors of deliveries, with a quota of 12,000 bales scheduled for the 22nd. However, the global cotton industry is still in good condition, and buyers are also holding on tightly. Spot yarn traders from the Tianjin region are actively buying on the North Road. After noon, sentiment improved and market prices returned to a favorable level. Yarn in warehouses is making every effort to sell, and it is said that more than 1,100 bales were sold yesterday.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Falls in the Morning and Rises in the Afternoon</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market in the morning, slight declines were seen in each month due to the consecutive days of gains in the prices of Grade 3 American cotton and yarn. However, the degree of decline was very slight. When auctioned to the far term, it was seen to rise instead. After the second session, the near term was weak and the far term was strong. By the time of closing, it was reported that the closing price of Grade 3 yarn had rebounded, and sentiment rose slightly. Spot yarn traders from the northern region still had an appetite. Each month rebounded by a few dimes. As a result, the closing price of standard yarn for each month fell by three or four dimes compared to the closing price of the previous day, and the far term rose by one dime. At the opening of the afternoon session, the market situation was tight, because Grade 3 yarn had risen again, and yarn sales to Tianjin continued to be strong. Moreover, more than 1,000 bales were sold from warehouses, and short covering caused another rise. The third session rebounded slightly. By the time of closing, it was reported that spot yarn was traded for more than 2,000 bales, and far-term sentiment remained positive. As a result, the closing price of standard yarn for each month rose by eight or nine dimes compared to the closing price in the morning. It was found that Juxing sold 2,450 bales, Jinchang 2,500 bales, Dachangcheng 4,200 bales, Hengyi 1,050 bales, Yudada 1,050 bales, Taichang 3,750 bales, Xiacheng 2,050 bales, Dachang 1,100 bales, and Xincheng 1,950 bales.

<p>The cotton market was weak in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the market trend slightly shifted towards firmness, because American cotton rose sharply and had a small pullback, and the decline in Indian cotton was also slight. Therefore, there was no enthusiastic selling, and the market sentiment was still stable. The demand from spot cotton mills has become quiet again.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Results Rebound Slightly</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market in the morning, American cotton, which had risen for a long time, retreated by 13 to 17 points, and Indian cotton fell by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees. Sentiment was still peaceful because the decline in foreign cotton was not intense, and there were no enthusiastic sellers. The auction was unchanged until the end of the month. There was a slight change after the second session. As a result, the closing price of standard cotton for each month fell by one to two dimes compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market situation was good at the opening of the afternoon session, and it was even more popular when auctioned to the far term. Because the yarn market rebounded, the upward force of Grade 3 cotton was particularly strong, and short covering caused it to be firm. As a result, the closing price for each month rose by 1.5 to 3 dimes compared to the closing price in the morning. It was found that Dafu sold 3,900 dan, Jifeng 2,500 dan, Juxing 1,700 dan, Daji 1,800 dan, Yuanyi 6,700 dan, Dachangcheng 6,800 dan, Yichang 1,600 dan, Yikang 5,000 dan, Xinchang 7,100 dan, Yuanxingchang 9,100 dan, Shenchang 3,300 dan, Taichang 6,300 dan, and Tonghe 2,100 dan.

<p>Spot cotton consumption is normal, and factory demand has become depressed. The source of supply is also not seen.</p>
<p>The Spot Price of American Cotton Remains Firm</p>
<p>There Was a Short Covering Rally Before Closing</p>
<p>The Decline in Yesterday's Telegraph Results Was Still Slight</p>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market opened extremely actively. Prices fell sharply by 23 to 38 points in each month due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and large-scale profit-taking by bulls. Subsequently, spot cotton was strong, spot traders and industry peers absorbed as much as possible. At the same time, short covering also occurred, and market prices rebounded. Before closing, industry peers bought, and the market trend rose again, especially in the far month. The closing was firm. Spot prices fell by 13 points, futures prices fell by 13 to 18 points, British cotton spot prices fell by 4 points, and futures prices fell by 4 to 5 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to large-scale purchases and short covering by Japanese merchants, but later weakened due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, Pingguo'er was unchanged, Oula fell by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by half a rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 8th).</p>

<h3>Piece Goods</h3>

<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Flour Sales Are Silent</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a trend of weakness followed by a rise in each month. The prices of foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada rebounded by 8 to 12 dimes. Liverpool fell by one pence and zero. When prices opened, market sentiment was once depressed due to the ups and downs of foreign wheat, so this month's opening price was as low as 4.01 yuan. With this low price, short covering was hurried, and the market rebounded as a result. Below the second session, there was only short covering, and long positions did not come out smoothly. This month once rose as high as 4.0525 yuan. The other months were all up by about 2 points. When the afternoon session opened, the recent sentiment became weak again and fell by one point compared to the morning, because spot sales were still not active. The months of July and August were little changed. At present, the market situation is ultimately difficult to stabilize due to the lack of spot sales.</p>
<p>River Rice Prices Are Being Revised Daily</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) 34 Niansan boats arrived at the dam. Transactions in each cargo were unusually quiet. High-quality white japonica rice prices were weak by several points, while medium-quality rice was down by about one dime. Bo rice was down by 6 or 7 points. Top-quality Yangxian rice was weak, while medium-quality goods and Bu rice prices were down by 3 or 5 points. Yinbian yuan rice prices were down by 7 or 8 points. Prices of other goods have also been revised.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 40 sources from various traders, with a total of 8,400 to 8,500 stones of goods, mostly thick japonica rice. Thick japonica rice sales were sluggish, and market conditions continued to fall by about one dime. Tianjin traders still bought more than 1,000 packages of thin rice, but local sales were very weak, resulting in mixed market colors. Retail sales were down by one dime. In short, the output of thin rice, bulk purchases, and retail sales are completely different. Foreign traders only look at whether there is transportation, while they only rely on changes in the weather and the amount of source arrivals, so there is a disparate phenomenon. Dujian is soft, and Yangjian has been out of stock for a long time, so it is quite fresh. Yin yuan is mediocre.</p>
<p>New Wheat Market Needs to Watch the Weather</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market was generally stable at the opening in the morning. This month, because the two sides were mutually exclusive, there was little fluctuation. In April, because the number of households was very scarce, and it was close to this month, it was therefore called higher by 3 or 5 points. Below June, because there were few customer exits, it was also called better by 1 or 2 points. At the opening of the afternoon session, this month was raised by 5 points because the arrival was not smooth and the production area price was also not cheap. In April, the bulls came out and fell by 2 or 3 points. Below June, it was generally fluctuating. Only the August sentiment was slightly better. At present, if the arrival source of Chen wheat is strong, it should not be too strong. If the new wheat has mild weather, sentiment will be easier to gradually level off. In the spot wheat market, the asking price was slightly reduced by 2 or 3 points due to the factory's lack of greed. Kaikai Tiantai wheat was 6.63 yuan and Chongming wheat was 6.53 yuan, with an estimated 1,000 packages.</p>
<p>Flour is Shipped North to Tianjin</p>
<p>Xian Rice is Shipped South to Guangdong Province</p>
<p>Among the goods shipped from this city to the Beiyang region, miscellaneous grains and flour are the main items. Two weeks ago, due to the New Year holidays and price relations, there was a period of stagnation, but it has recently become active again. It is reported that the total amount of flour shipped to Tianjin last week was approximately 500,000 bags. Today and tomorrow, there are more than 100,000 bags. It is reported that there is a large amount of flour waiting to be shipped. Since Yue Province experienced a rice panic, Da Shang has purchased from the Yangtze River and shipped it directly from Xunwu and other places. Even the transshipment in this city is not small. Today, the Haili, Taiyuan, Risheng, and Mingsheng wheels went to Guangdong, carrying more than 40,000 bags of rice.</p>
<p>Soybean Market Remains Firm</p>
<p>Standard oil beans continue to rise in the market. Oil rose by about three dimes, beans rose by four or five points, and the cake market was unchanged. However, at the opening in Shanghai in the morning, the bulls came out quite a bit, and new purchases were also light, so the market could not continue to climb. However, the spot soybeans have been actively depleted by Japanese customers, and the factory appetite is particularly greedy, so the incoming goods from various industries are clearing, so standard beans are being covered strongly, and the market has been pulled up by the connected market, and the market has gradually improved, and the closing price has risen by 4 to 6 points. Standard oil shops do not come out, and the price is also good by one dime and a half. Standard cake sales are more prevalent, but the price is still down by about one point.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was restrained by the Dalian telegram report, but the sales area continued, and the market was able to stand, and the market was elevated by one or two points compared to the previous market. A total of four cars of Yingzhou beans, three cars of Bengbu beans, 800 packages of Tancheng beans, more than 150 packages of Suqian beans, more than 200 packages of Shashi beans, more than 1,300 packages of Dudu Shayang, more than 1,500 packages of Hankou beans, and 350 packages of late beans, more than 300 packages of Jiujiang winter beans were transacted.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bond Trading Becoming Increasingly Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday's Market Did Not Reach 3 Million</p>
<p>Market Prices Were Still Good, Up 1-2 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's public bond market remained sluggish, showing no signs of recovery. Large traders continued to maintain their long and short positions, becoming more entrenched. Trading on the surface was as quiet as ever, but retail investors' confidence was quite strong, and buying power was still considerable. Market prices fluctuated and appeared to be holding up, but the trend remained difficult to escape the doldrums. Yesterday morning, the market opened with a slight decline due to the sale of chips of Nos. 11 and 43, but retail investors' buying interest remained strong. C and D bonds were up by 0.05 to 0.2 jiao. In the second session, the trend became firm again, and retail investors continued to buy diligently. Nos. 16 and 34 also absorbed a lot, and market prices immediately rebounded by about 0.1 jiao. Nos. 35 and 5, however, were selling off. In the afternoon, trading became even quieter, and retail investors were more active in swap transactions. However, due to the good confidence of the people, market prices remained up by 0.05 to 0.2 jiao. Only B bonds fell slightly by 0.05 jiao this month. At the close, because Nos. 10 and 38 had limited price buying that was very strong, C and D bonds continued to rise by about 0.1 jiao. However, the trend was still fluctuating. The closing result was that all bonds rose by 0.1 to 0.25 jiao, and A bonds fell by about 0.05 jiao next month. The total transaction volume was 2.47 million yuan. The comparison of price increases, decreases, highs, and lows is listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Foreign Firms' Ash Gray Trading Opens at 80 Packages</p>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk prices showed inconsistent trends, with Japanese prices weakening and American prices strengthening. New York silk (83-75 degrees), Shanghai silk, and Guangdong silk each increased by 0.02. Exchange recent term rose by 0.01, and futures rose by 0.02. Yokohama silk prices fell by 10 yuan for spot goods and 13 yuan for futures compared to the previous morning. In the Lyon silk market, Japanese silk rose by 2.25 francs, and Chinese silk remained unchanged. In the Shanghai silk market, there were still a few transactions in new silk. B-grade white factories largely sold off at prices ranging from 745 yuan to 755 yuan. Foreign firms' ash gray trading had been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and other firms purchased 80 packages. For user silk, silk weaving factories in various places have now started operations, and the demand for raw materials is gradually becoming urgent. Therefore, there are many transactions in silk for both local and foreign use, and market prices are stable without much fluctuation. Yesterday, the total number of transactions in the city was 242 packages.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Quanzhou Sliced Blue Sugar Rises by 0.2 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat. The association's price fixing showed that the spot price for No. 4 coarse white sugar was 22.85 yuan, with no change. Transit goods were 7.45 yuan, with a slight transaction, up by 0.05 jiao. There was not much change in Dongbai sugar. Transit goods (N) mark was 7.5 yuan, and SH mark was 7.4 yuan, both of which were released. The price of this factory's cotton white sugar was reduced by 0.1 jiao. Zhenji No. 1 was 21.6 yuan, No. 2 was 21.2 yuan, No. 3 was 20.8 yuan, No. 4 was 20.4 yuan, and No. 5 was 20 yuan. Dahua Golden Heart No. 1 was 21.8 yuan, No. 2 was 21.6 yuan, No. 3 was 21.4 yuan, No. 4 was 21.2 yuan, and No. 5 was 21 yuan. The number plate had Quanzhou gang opening Quanzhou sliced blue sugar for several hundred packages, with the higher price being 11.8 yuan, and the second-highest being 11.6 yuan, which was 0.2 jiao higher than yesterday.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Fruits</h3>
<p>Walnut Sales Remain Sluggish</p>
<p>Walnut sales have been sluggish recently, and the trend continues to weaken. Currently, the market price for hand-picked walnuts is 26-27 yuan, Changping walnuts are 18-19 yuan, Bozhou walnuts are 16-17 yuan, Shimen walnuts are 23-24 yuan to 22 yuan, and Shilu walnuts are 14-15 yuan. Walnut kernels are also weak. Cleared goods are 31-32 yuan to 30 yuan, Lingbao kernels are 27-28 yuan, and Shangtao kernels are 25-26 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>New Galvanized Iron Wire Prices Slightly Lower</p>
<p>The trading of new galvanized iron wire has been very active recently. The market selling price for No. 16 to No. 20 is estimated at 14 yuan per dan, and No. 21 to No. 25 is estimated at 17.5 yuan, both of which are about 1-2 yuan lower than before. However, customers and factories are reluctant to buy at these prices. It is reported that overseas factories have set prices for No. 16 to No. 20 at 22 pounds per ton (equivalent to about 21 yuan per dan in Shanghai), and No. 21 to No. 25 is priced at 32 pounds (equivalent to over 30 yuan per dan in Shanghai), which is higher than the prices in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>Production Index for the Second Half of Last Year</p>
<p>The Economic Research Department of the Central Bank released the production index for the second half of the 25th year of the Republic as follows:</p>
<p>Starting from July of the 25th year of the Republic, the monthly indexes for flour and matches have not yet been obtained for Sichuan materials. For the item of cotton yarn in November, not all regions have arrived. In December, cotton yarn, cigarettes, and beer are missing, so the total index is not calculated for the time being. The output of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces was not previously included, so it is still not included in the calculation for comparison purposes. Starting from January of the 26th year of the Republic, it is planned to thoroughly organize the statistical materials, and the index will also be revised. At that time, the output of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces will be included in the calculation.</p>
<h3>Compilation Method of Income Tax Return Forms (6)</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>(3) Business Registration Statement</p>
<p>(7) Business Year: The business year is the year determined in the accounting final accounts, also known as the accounting year. According to Articles 166 and 260 of the Company Law, at the end of each business year, the directors or unlimited liability shareholders of limited companies and limited partnerships should prepare final account statements, etc., and submit them to the supervisors for review in preparation for reporting to the shareholders' meeting. Although the Company Law does not have the term "business year" for unlimited companies and partnerships, the distribution of profits and the calculation of the Class 1 profit-seeking enterprise income tax are dependent on the annual final accounts. Therefore, it is also necessary to determine the business year. Therefore, Article 8 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that the income of Class 1 A and B profit-seeking enterprises should be settled once a year. The start and end of this type of year, if using the calendar year system, is from January 1 to December 31 each year. If not using the calendar year system, a date can be chosen according to the habits of each industry or practical convenience. As long as it satisfies twelve months, it becomes a year. The information to be filled in on this form is the start and end dates. For example, from March 1 each year to the end of February of the following year, or ending with the merchant's total closing period each year, etc. According to Article 8 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the income of Class 1 A and B profit-seeking enterprises should be reported to the competent collection agency within three months after the annual settlement by the taxpayers. The so-called settlement is the final account. This year is the first year for the collection of Class 1 profit-seeking enterprise income tax. If the business year does not follow the calendar year system, from January 1 of the 26th year of the Republic to the day before the start of this business year, the income should be settled and reported separately according to Articles 9 and 22 of the Implementing Regulations. For merchants whose business ends this year according to the merchant's total closing period (i.e., ending on February 10), the government authorities are still considering how to report the Class 1 profit-seeking enterprise income from January 1 to February 10. However, it has been announced that it will be reported separately at the end of this year.</p>
<p>(8) Remarks: The remarks section is used to fill in matters other than the various matters mentioned above. There are usually two items to be filled in: (1) Reserve fund. According to Article 7 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Article 11 of the Taxpayer Instructions for Class 1 Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax, the reserve fund set aside by the company in accordance with laws and regulations can be included in the capital calculation by one-third to calculate the percentage of income to the actual amount of capital. This reserve fund refers to the reserve fund stipulated in Article 170 of the Company Law. It is greatly related to the calculation of future income tax and should be filled in the remarks section. (2) Main and branch stores. According to Article 6 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Article 2 of the Draft Collection Instructions for Class 1 Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax, if the main store and its branch stores are both in the country, the income can be calculated together, except for those with completely independent capital and business. Therefore, this type of branch store should be filled in the remarks section of this form first and report the reason for the joint calculation for future reference. If the person filling in this form is a branch store and the capital is not divided, the words "capital is in the main store" can be filled in the total number of shares and the paid-up share capital section, and the name and location of the main store can be filled in the remarks section. If the branch store meets the provisions of Article 5 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Article 5 of the Draft Collection Instructions for Class 1 Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax and should calculate its income separately, and remove the profits from the business in the foreign part, it should be filled in the remarks section of this form.</p>
<p>(9) Date of Filing: The date of filing this form should also be filled in on this form. The information filled in on this form should be the situation at the time of the filing date. If there are changes in the future, no matter what kind of matter is changed, a report of the change should be made. (To be continued)</p>

<p>National Goods Special Issue</p>

<h3>The Effectiveness of Visiting Housewives</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The National Goods Movement United Association of this city has been conducting visits to housewives for half a year. Although it has not been universally effective, according to conversations with the staff of National Goods Companies and various factories, many customers have come from these visits.</p>
<p>One morning, I met Mr. Song Hanzhang, a senior member of the banking industry, at the Wuhe Weaving Factory. He was choosing cotton sweaters and said that his family unanimously admired national goods and could come to buy them on their own without waiting for visits. Mr. Song, as an authority in the domestic financial industry, has such faith in national goods. How should we in the national goods industry strive to live up to Mr. Song's kindness and enthusiasm?</p>
<p>Another day, I went to the Kangyuan Factory to visit Mr. Kangyuan. A phone call came from a certain public residence. Mrs. Li said that she planned to give toys to the children of relatives as New Year's gifts during the Lunar New Year to replace New Year's money. After listening to the report of the female visitor, she said that the toys of your factory are rich in educational meaning, so please send some samples first for bulk purchase. The effectiveness of the visits can be seen again.</p>
<p>Recently, someone entrusted me to buy a large number of light bulbs from Yapu, and someone asked about the glass cups and various new medicines of the Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, various fabrics of the Sanyou Society Hongxin Factory, and the cosmetics and various colors of silk satin of the China Chemical Industry Society and Wuzhou. All said that they came from the mouths of the female visitors. From these messages, it can be seen that everything depends on human effort. Housewives, who does not love the country, who has no conscience, who does not enjoy using national goods, who does not believe in national products? It only needs someone to explain and advise and provide various kinds of guidance.</p>
<h3>Establish a National Goods Market at the City God Temple</h3>
<p>— Ms. Qiao Jianhua</p>
<p>This Lunar New Year, some friends came from the inland. I inevitably accompanied them to various places to play. One afternoon, we arrived at the City God Temple in Nanshi. The lively and crowded situation need not be said. What is most worthy of our attention there is the various shops and stalls. I am afraid that more than 90% of the things displayed are imported goods. Especially those manufactured by our friendly ally occupy the vast majority.</p>
<p>We went upstairs to a dim sum shop to eat some dim sum with unique flavors. Everyone discussed this serious problem and at the same time saw the small world amusement park on the opposite side that had been destroyed. The house has not been repaired to this day. It is believed that this site can be used to design a complete national goods market.</p>
<p>Our opinions can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>First, the City God Temple in Shanghai is a world-famous location. Many foreigners who come to Shanghai for the first time or who have lived in Shanghai for a long time also go to visit. Seeing the current situation of imported goods flooding the market, isn't it undermining the Taiwanese of our people? From an international perspective, establishing a national goods market at the City God Temple is necessary.</p>
<p>Second, the location of the National Goods Market on Nanjing Road in Shanghai does not seem to be the best, but the business is still relatively developed. However, people living in Nanshi often feel inconvenient to buy. Visiting the City God Temple is something that people from the inland or people living in Shanghai want to do. Then, buying some daily necessities along the way is also human nature. Establishing a national goods market here, with the superior location of the City God Temple, business development can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Third, the small world amusement park was destroyed. In the current era when amusement parks have reached the end of the road, it does not seem necessary to rush to restore it alone. Why not rebuild the entire site of the small world into a five-story cement building? The ground floor can still be rented to various shops as it is now, but one condition is to sell national goods. The second and third floors are national goods department stores. The fourth floor can be used as office space. The fifth floor can be used as an amusement park. Then, the scale will be grand and the market will be prosperous, which is not a problem.</p>
<p>Fourth, the landlords of the small world site are said to be several. Most of them are owned by the Pudong Sanlin School Board of Directors. The school directors are all enthusiastic patriots. Then, the association's approval of this plan is undoubtedly. The other part is owned by the municipal government, which does not seem to be a problem. If a national goods organization or the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs initiates it and contacts the local landlords and the City God Temple Board of Directors to organize a design committee to be responsible for the implementation, then everyone will work together easily. The realization of the national goods market is not difficult.</p>
<p>Fifth, the fundraising of funds. The landlords can pay the construction costs, and the national goods factories can pay the operating costs. Or another company can be formed. Or the factories can jointly operate. Or women can be fully responsible for managing the retail. Establishing a model of women's commerce can all be left to the design committee to discuss and decide on specific methods. I will not mention it here for the time being.</p>
<p>Such superficial opinions, can they be implemented in practice? I hope that the wise authorities, patriotic citizens, and national goods manufacturers will come together to seek more complete and concrete methods and gradually turn from words into facts. Then, throwing a brick to attract jade, the author's Lunar New Year tour of the City God Temple felt absolutely meaningful.</p>
<h3>From Trade Deficits to Joint Production and Sales by National Goods Industries</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xuepeng</p>
<p>, using armed force as their backing to evade this only tariff. Or, more simply, they set up factories in China, using China's cheap raw materials and labor, and under their scientific management, manufactured a large number of commodities to dump in various places, monopolizing our country's market. In this situation, how can the national goods industry raise its head?</p>
<p>(2) Transportation Problems - Transportation is the key element for industrial development. Our country's railways are not developed, and highways are also inconvenient. Therefore, most of the transportation of goods relies on navigation, and the sovereignty of our country's inland river navigation is in the hands of foreigners. Therefore, the fate of the development of national goods is also controlled by foreigners. Although there are also state-owned and Chinese-owned shipping companies, the proportion is so small that it is often not enough to allocate, so we have to rely on foreign ships. Foreign ships carry national goods, and the freight is expensive and often slow. Moreover, there are still customs scandals, and the result is that Chinese businessmen can only sigh in despair!</p>
<p>Judging from the above two points alone, it is indeed difficult for national goods to achieve final victory. However, I believe that in addition to removing all obstacles that may hinder the development of the national goods industry, the only way is for national goods industrial factories to implement a joint production and sales system. Why is this? The reasons are described below:</p>
<p>(1) After the implementation of joint production and sales, it is possible to investigate the needs of the market, control the production quantity and sales price, and avoid the impact of oversupply and cheap competition.</p>
<p>(2) Standardize the standards to standardize production.</p>
<p>(3) Raw materials can be purchased in large quantities by the "Joint Production and Sales Office of the Industry" and distributed to various factories, reducing costs.</p>
<p>(4) Establish a research institute to specialize in the products of the industry. When better manufacturing methods are discovered, they should be secretly disclosed, and all factories should benefit from them.</p>
<p>(5) Due to joint production and sales, it is possible to control the product market and compete with imported goods.</p>
<p>(6) Because the production and sales affairs are handled by the "Joint Production and Sales Office of the Industry," the expenses of each factory can be reduced.</p>
<p>The above six items are all the benefits of joint production and sales by national goods industrial factories. The specific plan for its implementation is beyond the scope of this article, so it is omitted.</p>
<p>Opening up the annual customs trade book, we know that our country has had huge trade deficits over the years. Therefore, people are worried and believe that the reason why national goods cannot raise their heads is entirely due to trade deficits. In fact, this is an overestimation. My opinion is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In our country with backward industry, we have to rely on foreign goods for many things, and trade deficits are inevitable.</p>
<p>(2) Import trade is divided into tangible and intangible. Tangible means imported goods, and intangible includes foreign investment, remittances from overseas Chinese, and travel expenses for foreigners coming to China, etc. At the same time, we must know that international payments are not necessarily paid directly in cash, but are mostly taken in the form of goods. After the European War, the following two phenomena occurred in our country's international trade:</p>
<p>(1) Years with larger trade deficits were years with more silver inflow.</p>
<p>(2) Years with increased export trade were years with more silver outflow.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that trade deficits are not necessarily cash outflows, and cash inflows are not necessarily trade surpluses. Therefore, in reality, trade deficits are not as serious as generally thought. On the contrary, we should allow for trade deficits.</p>
<p>As for the problem that national goods cannot raise their heads, it is complicated and cannot be fully described in this article. Now I would like to raise only the most important point, hoping that those who promote the national goods movement and national goods manufacturers across the country will pay attention.</p>
<p>This point is the issue of "joint production and sales by national goods industrial factories." Before describing the importance of this issue, we must first review the current environment of national goods.</p>
<p>(1) Tax Collection Issues - Although our country's tariff rate is several times lower than that of any independent country, imperialists still complain that it is too high.</p>
<h3>Introducing "A Light Cavalry Unit of the National Products Movement"</h3>
<p>— Ms. Xu Songzi</p>
<p>I remember when the home visit work had just started, Mr. Yang Ang once told us, "Housewives are the main body of purchasing national products. If housewives are enthusiastic about national products, the way out for national products will naturally be unimpeded. But how to open up this way out is the task of female visitors."</p>
<p>At present, the home visit work has been going on for half a year, and it has been deeply supported by thousands of housewives. Anyone who thinks that what should be discussed is not to remove obstacles on the way out, but to lay the foundation for the work, that would be an incredibly foolish view.</p>
<p>For those unwise doubts, facts will naturally refute their fallacies. What we always keep in mind is how to remedy the shortcomings of the work and make the work go more smoothly?"</p>
<p>From actual work, we deeply feel that each meeting with a housewife, although it is to look at the situation at the time and make appropriate remarks, it is considered achieved only after attracting people and then turning to the topic. However, on the other hand, due to concerns about the universality of work efficiency, we have to end the conversation in a short time. Therefore, it is inevitable that there are places where the meaning is not fully expressed. Moreover, in today's market filled with foreign goods, the average housewife has the pain of not being able to distinguish the authenticity of national products. Even after detailed explanations, it is inevitable that there will be places of "missing one out of ten thousand" due to too many goods.</p>
<p>Secondly, the gift coupons and promotional materials entrusted to us by various manufacturers have been quite effective, and most of them are considered luxurious and practical, but because the paper colors of each factory are different, they are not suitable for long-term preservation and are difficult to have a lasting effect. As for the national product publications that we have handled and seen daily, the number is also quite large. If we investigate the actual situation, except for this journal – the National Products Special Issue – and a few similar publications that have her serious significance in guiding the national products movement, most of them emphasize advertising over content. Although the editors themselves believe they are doing everything possible to promote, they make people see them as "advertising publications" at first glance, and whether they are welcomed is imaginable. However, the general housewives' hope for the supply of good reading materials is also a very practical thing.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned shortcomings, although small personal opinions, should not be ignored for the future of the visit work (that is, the future of the national products movement).</p>
<p>How to remedy these shortcomings, we have had a long period of consideration, that is, the publication of the "Housewives' Friend" bi-monthly, which is to be introduced in this article as a light cavalry unit in the national products movement?</p>
<p>We believe that under the current situation, there are very few publications that are based on promoting national products and have rich content. As for those that can cater to the psychology of housewives and penetrate into families, there are even fewer. We hope that this "Housewives' Friend" that we edit and publish in our spare time can make a small contribution.</p>
<p>What we hope for "Housewives' Friend" is: –</p>
<p>(1) She will have a luxurious appearance and rich content, so that housewives will be deeply influenced by the national products propaganda in "subtle influence."</p>
<p>(2) To systematically introduce national products, to make up for the shortcomings of our conversations with housewives. To constantly discuss the general methods of identifying national products, so that housewives will not mistakenly buy foreign goods. And to set up a national product consultation column, reserved for housewives to consult.</p>
<p>(3) Standing in the position of housewives, to criticize national products with a fair attitude, so that excellent products can show their advantages even more; those who are roughly manufactured will have the opportunity to improve.</p>
<p>(4) To open a special column for "National Products Market", to classify and compile the national products needed for daily life, so that housewives can have the convenience of "finding what they need according to the map" when purchasing goods.</p>
<p>(5) Advertisements and gift coupons from various manufacturers can be inserted in attached pages. This can save the cost of printing each one, and also give housewives the value and effect of permanent cherishing.</p>
<p>(7) Each issue is published and delivered to the hands of housewives by the visitors, so that the housewives and the visitors can maintain a permanent and sincere friendship, and in fact, it is to promote their broad and profound views on the national products movement.</p>
<p>Naturally, our ability is very weak. However, whether we can shoulder this important task is not what we want to ask. What we want to ask is, do national product movement activists under the iron hooves of foreign goods have the need to rise up, fight for the "main body of purchasing national products," weave their own light cavalry unit, and attack foreign goods?</p>
<p>Finally, we are reaching out our hands here, and we hope that all those who sympathize with us will not hesitate to lend a helping hand!</p>
<h3>Idle Talk on Gift Giving</h3>
<p>— Wang Yongtao</p>
<p>We are deposited in society, and for the sake of connecting feelings and all other relationships, it is inevitable to be active in the custom of giving gifts! If your friend has a happy event, after you receive the invitation, you will have to plan to send a gift. However, the gift must be welcomed by the other party, otherwise, if the gift is not given properly, it will cause the other party's displeasure. What I have seen recently is a very good example. My friend Mr. Li got married last month. When I heard this good news, I sent him a national product gift certificate. At the same time, his relatives and friends also came to give gifts in droves. Later, after Mr. Li carefully checked all the gifts, except for a few cash and calligraphy scrolls, three-quarters of them were gift certificates from various major companies. Mr. Li has always advocated national products. He shook his head and said to me, "Alas! Why don't you change so many gift certificates to national product gift certificates? How can I redeem national products?..." From this, you can know the necessity of considering gift giving.</p>
<p>The China National Products Company and Sanyou Industrial Company in Shanghai are both very great pure domestic stores. The goods they sell, such as cloth, woolen fabrics, cosmetics, etc., are simply all-inclusive, and they issue national product gift certificates, which are very exquisite and simple. You can redeem them for goods at any time. If you give this gift certificate to relatives and friends, they will not only be very welcome, but also admire you as a patriotic element who promotes national products. Therefore, the author sincerely hopes that you, the readers, will adopt national product gift certificates in the future, so that there will be unlimited hope for the development of national products.</p>

<p>Written Statement</p>
<p>I was ordered to serve as ambassador to Japan, and departed on March 6 last year to take up my post. This time I am asking for leave to report on my duties, and also left the embassy on March 6 to return to China. During this year, I have handled everything in accordance with the orders of the Central Government. Although I have passively been fortunate enough not to increase diplomatic difficulties, I have not actively established any achievements. Recalling the grand enthusiasm of the people of the country and friends from all sides when I was sent off, and the earnest expectations, I feel extremely ashamed. During my tenure, various incidents occurred continuously. First, there was the Guangdong-Guangxi Incident, followed by the Qingjin Consulate Case, and the injuries to Japanese residents in the concession of Chengdu, Beihai, Shanghai and Hankou came one after another. Finally, there was the invasion of Suiyuan by bandits and puppets, which led to the Xi'an Incident that shocked the world. The changes and ups and downs all produced subtle reflections on diplomacy. Diplomatic personnel were also in a state of tension and excitement every day. However, I have a very firm belief that the great cause of unity of our government will surely be completed, and that the people of the whole country will be able to remain calm and steadfast, and under the leadership of the government, take orderly steps to advance towards the road of national rejuvenation. I will never be pessimistic, and I also hope that friendly countries will not despise us. I have earnestly told the Japanese government and the public that the rapid resolution of the Xi'an Incident and the spirit of unity of our people in supporting the leader have provided great proof and are seen by the world. Therefore, all parties in Japan are singing the saying of re-examining and re-understanding China. This is the true expression of what I said when I was about to leave the country, "It is internal and not external, and it is better to seek oneself than to seek others." It is very gratifying. Today, the country is still at a critical juncture of survival, and the key is related to the endless misfortunes of the nation. I deeply hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will be conscientious and work together to overcome difficulties. Take Japan as an example. Its people are hardworking and industrious, and its industry and commerce are developing. Its research in academics is thorough in old studies, and its progress in new studies is long-term. It is good at creating for reasons, so it can build a foundation of wealth and strength. This is what we should catch up with quickly, so as not to be ashamed of being the most backward country with the oldest culture and history. I am determined that diplomacy should take justice as its purpose, and that the success of achieving justice must be based on absolute sincerity. Therefore, everything in Japan is based on justice and sincerity, and I follow the instructions of the Central Government to deal with it. In terms of diplomatic technology, I advocate that it should be in an active position, and should not be controlled by others in everything and be in a passive position. Although success cannot be guaranteed, it should always be done in this way. However, I feel that to study and observe the national conditions of a country, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of its history, culture, customs, and human feelings. It is a very painful thing to force a blind person to see and a dumb person to speak. This time, I can take a short break, and I deeply hope that the government, for the sake of developing proactive and just diplomacy, can enable foreign envoys to fully exert the function of the country's vision and hearing, and make it easier for them to progress.</p>

<h3>Press Colleagues Held a Banquet to Celebrate Mayor Wu's Fiftieth Birthday</h3>
<p>Wang Boqi Delivered a Congratulatory Speech and Hu Pu'an Presented a Screen</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, yesterday was Mayor Wu of Shanghai's fiftieth birthday. Because Mayor Wu did not want to be extravagant, he tried to hide it in every possible way. Only press colleagues knew about it. Because Mr. Wu has been in office for five years, benefiting the local people, and has been able to do his best to maintain the news industry, they held a public celebration banquet at Xinghualou on the evening of the 6th and presented a marble engraving of "Like the Sun at Noon" as a birthday screen. Representatives from various newspapers including Shen Bao Li Yonggeng, Ma Yinliang, Zhou Mengxiong, Xinwen Bao Wang Boqi, Wang Weizhen, Li Haoran, Yan Duhe, Shibao Huang Bohui, Shishi Xinbao Cui Weiwu, Fan Gongbi, Min Bao Hu Xuan'an, Guan Ji'an, Yuan Yeyu, Zhonghua Ribao Liang Xiuyu, Guo Xiufeng, Dagong Bao Zhang Weiluan, Li Zikuan, Wang Yunsheng, Libao Wu Zhongyi, Dalu Bao Dong Guangxian, Yang Guangxian, Dawan Bao Zeng Xubai, and Shenzhou Ribao Jiang Guangtang were present, and Secretary-General Yu, bureau chiefs, Section Chief Li Dachao, Secretary Chen Kecheng, Secretary Chen Xunxiao, and Director Feng Youzhen of the Central News Agency were invited to accompany them. During the banquet, Wang Boqi delivered a congratulatory speech, saying that this year we are happy to celebrate Mayor Wu's fiftieth birthday. Shanghai press colleagues deeply admire the mayor's various political achievements over the past five years, as well as his hard work and perseverance in maintaining local security. Therefore, today we take this opportunity of a public birthday banquet to express our admiration briefly. Mayor Wu is the most constructive politician in the party and the country, and he is also a strict soldier. In the past, all the facilities in Guangzhou, as well as the mediation of the non-northern easy banner incident, and the promotion of China's unification, are facts that the whole country has seen. Since taking office as mayor of this city, it has coincided with the serious national crisis. There have been various battles in Songhu, the Great Wall, and Sui East, as well as the Xi'an Incident that shocked the world on December 12 last year. These short five years are the most difficult stage in our country's history. Shanghai is the largest city in the country, with a mixture of Chinese and foreigners. Its importance is not only the barrier of the southeast half of the country, but also the concentration of national resources and wealth. In a special environment, it is a place that is most difficult to deal with when it comes into contact with foreign forces on the one hand and the uneven quality of residents on the other hand. In the process of stormy waves, the mayor seems to be the chief helmsman of the city's 3.7 million people, who can lead the citizens to a safe area or to a dangerous area. As a result of Mayor Wu's efforts, he has after all led the citizens to a safe area. Since the beginning of this year, although the national crisis has not been resolved, our nation has indeed stepped into the path of rejuvenation step by step. At the time of the bright spring, we are happy to celebrate Mayor Wu's fiftieth birthday. In addition to expressing our respect for the mayor's past political achievements, we also want to wish the mayor all the best in the future. The souvenir we presented to Mayor Wu is engraved with the four characters "Like the Sun at Noon". The reason is that fifty years old is a period of rich experience and full of energy. In ancient times, people established virtue, established words, and established merit, often after the "strong and prosperous years". The achievements of modern politicians and great scholars in various countries are also mostly after the age of fifty. Ancient and modern China and foreign countries are all the same. We still remember that last October, the whole country congratulated Chairman Chiang on his fiftieth birthday. Today, we are here to celebrate Mayor Wu's fiftieth birthday. The time difference is only three months, and Chairman Chiang and Mayor Wu are both shouldering major national missions with a rich and strong body, which is truly a rare grand event. Mayor Wu's past political achievements have already occupied a glorious page. I am waiting for the auspicious day of the summit, and I congratulate Mayor Wu on his continued efforts to open up a splendid future and create more blessings for the country and the local people. This is the unanimous wish of the people to wish people longevity and the world longevity. After the speech, Hu Xuan'an was elected as the representative to present the screen, and everyone applauded. Then Mayor Wu gave a thank-you speech, and everyone left happily at around 10:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Bureau Will Increase Property Tax</h3>
<p>Foreign Taxpayers Will Discuss</p>
<p>According to the Dalu Bao, a senior official of the Public Works Bureau told a Dalu Bao reporter yesterday that recently, schools, hospitals, and other organizations have been allocating a lot of funds to the Public Works Bureau. The Public Works Bureau cannot cook without rice. The only way to deal with it is to increase the municipal tax. The municipal tax collected in the Public Concession is probably the lowest in the world. Therefore, it is expected that when the Public Works Bureau's directors hold a regular meeting next Wednesday to discuss the budget for the next fiscal year, they may propose to increase the municipal tax by 2% to 16%. If the new budget and the tax increase are passed by the directors, they will be submitted to the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers to be held next month for review. If so, there will be a debate at that time.</p>

<p>Flying Across the Pacific</p>
<h3>China's First Passenger Zhang Yuanbei Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Talks About How Flying Across the Pacific Was Extremely Smooth, America's Aviation is Developed, We Should Catch Up Quickly</p>
<p>According to Shenzhou News Agency, Zhang Yuanbei, former instructor of the Hangzhou Central Aviation School and current manager of Martin Aircraft Company, went abroad at his own expense on August 20 last year to inspect the aviation industry in the United States. He traveled all over the United States and finished his business. He flew across the Pacific Ocean to Little Luzon and transferred to the President Hoover to Shanghai. He arrived at the port at 11:30 a.m. yesterday. More than a dozen friends of Mr. Zhang and Shen Deshe of the Aviation Administration, Zhao Daosheng of the Ministry of Finance, and Zhou Peize of the Central Mint arrived at the pier to welcome him. A Shenzhou News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Zhang yesterday to talk about his inspection situation as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection of the Aviation Industry</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang, "I went to the United States in August last year to inspect the aviation industry. For seven months, I traveled all over the United States and made on-site inspections. I visited ten national talent training institutions in the United States, and twenty-three famous aircraft manufacturing plants and supply plants. I also met with factory owners and aviation experts to discuss the progress of the aviation industry. I deeply admire the large number of airlines in the United States and the punctuality of the aircraft's flight times. I myself spent a day in the central flight tower in New York to observe the traffic of aircraft and the situation of take-off and landing, and I felt that the management was effective. Although there are aircraft coming and going every two minutes, the order is orderly and well-organized."</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Yuanbei</h3>
<p>Flying Across the Pacific</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang continued, "When I was in the United States, I flew a plane from New York to Vancouver (in Canada) in about a day. I also made many trips in the United States. The total distance I traveled in the air was about 12,000 miles in the United States. Finally, I flew across the Pacific Ocean, about 8,000 miles. I took the Pan Pacific Company's 'China Clipper' and flew from the United States to Manila. I departed on February 25 and arrived on March 3, a total of 60 hours. The altitude was about 8,500 feet to 9,000 feet. The weather was clear that day and the climate was good. The flight was extremely smooth and safe." Mr. Zhang's flight across the Pacific Ocean this time is said to be the first Chinese passenger.</p>
<p>Advocating Aircraft Manufacturing</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang said to the Shenzhou News Agency reporter at the end, "I have long wanted to go to the United States to study aviation, but I was unable to do so due to obstacles. It was not until last year that I was able to make the trip. I studied practical problems in aircraft manufacturing, pilot training, aircraft combat, and aircraft protection in the United States. Through this inspection, I deeply know the importance of the aviation industry in the international community. The past European war and the recent war in Spain can all be used as proof of the facts. I also hope that I can be of some help to the aviation industry in our country in the future. Although the aviation industry in our country is still in its infancy, as long as we continue to work hard, we will not always lag behind. The most important thing at present is to (1) assist the government with civilian power to complete aircraft manufacturing and increase people's interest in aircraft, so that they are happy to invest; (2) The United States now manufactures aircraft like manufacturing automobiles. Our country must be able to set up factories to manufacture them ourselves; (3) The government should encourage the establishment of various matching parts factories, because aircraft are all made up of matching parts. For example, there is a factory in Shanghai that makes electricity meters, which can be cited; (4) The technology of Chinese pilots is not behind compared with other countries, but the quantity is too small and must be strengthened; (5) Manufacturing aircraft is not difficult, as long as people are interested and determined, 55% of the labor is required for the completion of each aircraft. With the development of our country's handicrafts and the low wages, if we can promote the aircraft manufacturing industry, it will definitely develop. I have many feelings this time, but the most important thing is to encourage people to donate money to buy aircraft, and more importantly, to promote investment in setting up factories to manufacture aircraft ourselves."</p>
<h3>The Speech of the Japanese Foreign Minister Has Aroused Great Attention in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Considered to be a Declaration with Many Points of Truth and Insight</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the speech of the new Japanese Foreign Minister Naotake Sato on Japan's foreign policy in the House of Peers on the 8th was published by Shanghai newspapers in large characters in an important position, which aroused great attention from all walks of life. The general public believes that Foreign Minister Sato's declaration has many words of truth and insight, such as saying "The current Sino-Japanese problem can only be solved by us (Japan) changing the method and starting from a new starting point." "Everything in the past should be let go, and negotiations should be conducted from a new equal footing." These are all accurate and easy-to-see arguments, which have not been said by previous foreign ministers in recent years. As for his saying "In diplomacy, one should not forget the other party," and "Negotiations between completely independent countries should be based on equality," they are even more rational and coincide with the basic principles of our country's foreign policy. Our new Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui's remarks to reporters on the 8th advocated that international relations should be based on equality and mutual benefit. What Foreign Minister Wang calls "equality" and "mutual benefit" are no different from what Foreign Minister Sato advocates "should be based on equality" and "should not forget the other party in diplomacy." The two new foreign ministers issued important declarations on the same day, and the content of the declarations is also mostly the same in its purpose, which can be said to be a coincidence. People here praised Foreign Minister Sato's correct views and deeply hope that he will overcome all difficulties and work hard based on the principles of "equality" and "not forgetting the other party" so that the relations between China and Japan can have a turning point.</p>

<h3>Yamamoto and Zhanbu Are Unwilling to Be Elected as New Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that the Japanese residents in Shanghai had nominated Yamamoto and Zhanbu as candidates for the new directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council last week. Both are incumbent directors, so it was widely expected that they would be re-elected. Unexpectedly, on the 5th of this month, both declared their unwillingness to be elected, without announcing the reasons. Public opinion believes that this was due to the fact that the Japanese-language "Shanghai Daily" had published several articles last week criticizing the Japanese residents' nomination system and attacking the two gentlemen.

<p>Various shipping companies in Shanghai have received a notice from the Xiamen Customs stating that if any ship passing through the waters of Xiamen encounters a shallow sandy beach river buoy (i.e., a floating buoy) set up by the Customs, and it is broken and drifting in the port due to wind and waves, the ship should immediately bring it back and report it to the Customs. If the ship sees it but does not bring it back or report it to the Xiamen Customs, the captain of the ship will be sentenced to three years' imprisonment. This severe measure has been announced and implemented. Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received this telegram and immediately informed the captains of all ocean-going ships of this prohibition for their information.</p>

Night shift work will receive a subsidy of 7 cents per person per night. 3. Wages will be increased twice a year, with each increase being no less than 10%, with the dates set as January 1st and July 1st (only for those who have worked for more than six months). 4. Wage increases will be the same as before, with two wage increases per month. 5. The wages for warping workers are 56 cents for 10,000 warps on the reeling machine and 45 cents on the warping machine per 100 meters. 6. The daily working hours are set at 11 hours. 7. Those who are responsible for more than one warp per day will receive a subsidy of 25 cents per person per day. 8. Wages will be paid as usual on statutory holidays. If work is required, wages will be doubled. 9. Work will be stopped on Sundays. If work is required, wages will be doubled. 10. Wages will be paid as usual for the period of the strike. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM. It is reported that the workers of the three factories have all resumed work last night.</p>
<h3>Lun Chang Printing and Dyeing Factory Workers Resumed Work Voluntarily</h3>
<p>Two Days' Wages Paid for the Strike Period; Other Conditions to Be Mediated by the Party and Government</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that more than 1,200 male and female workers of the British-owned Lun Jing Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, went on a full-scale strike to demand increased wages and improved treatment after being rejected by the factory. As the opinions of labor and management differed greatly, the strike lasted for a week. The day before yesterday, all the workers sent 12 representatives to various agencies such as the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labour Union to petition for relief, and the strike seemed to be expanding. After hearing the news, the factory immediately invited the heads of various departments and worker representatives to negotiate again at 4:00 PM. As a result, the factory agreed to continue negotiations on the six conditions proposed by the workers. As for the wages during the workers' strike period, the factory agreed to pay for one day. All the workers agreed, as the factory's attitude had been conciliatory, so more than 1,000 night shift workers voluntarily resumed work at 5:30 PM the night before last, and the day shift workers also went to work as usual yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>A Large Shark Was Transported to the New World</h3>

<h3>Three Things Businessmen Should Pay Attention to After the Implementation of Income Tax (Continued)</h3>
<p>Li Wenjie's Speech at the Civic Auditorium Offers Important Reference for the Business Community</p>
<p>(C) Matters Requiring Attention During Final Accounting</p>
<p>The final accounting is the result of accurately recording the increase or decrease of assets. The declaration and payment of income tax for profit-seeking enterprises are both done after the end of the accounting year. Therefore, the final accounting can also be said to be the most important part of the preparation work for paying income tax. Here, we should recognize two points regarding the legislative principles of the current income tax law:</p>
<p>㊀ The adoption of the annual taxation principle and ㊁ the strict application of the accrual basis. According to the first point, the operating losses of the previous year cannot be included in the calculations of the current year. Based on the second point, the draft guidelines for the first category of collection clearly explain the meaning of total income and actual expenses, and the methods for valuing various assets (including deferred assets) have been explained earlier. This article uses the provisions of current laws and regulations as the backbone, and will not comment on the merits and demerits of these provisions. The following describes the matters that should be paid attention to during the final accounting:</p>
<p>㊀ Consolidation of Accounting for Head Office and Branch Offices: Assuming that there is no separation of capital between the head office and branch offices, and the business is not completely independent, the accounts of the branch offices should be consolidated with the accounts of the head office during the final accounting to reflect their overall financial situation and operating performance. If the final accounting of the head office's accounts is limited to the assets, liabilities, and profits and losses of the head office, and the "branch office current account" is used for the funds and goods allocated to the branch offices and included in the head office's accounts, and the assets, liabilities, and profits and losses of the branch offices are not taken into account, then the final accounting statements cannot reflect the overall operating situation, and the resulting profit and loss figures will not be accurate. The basis for calculating income tax will naturally also be shaken. Therefore, when the head office handles the final accounting, it must combine the assets, liabilities, losses, and profits of the branch offices into the calculation.</p>
<p>㊁ Organization of Various Items of Accounts Receivable, Uncollected, Accounts Payable, Unpaid, Prepaid, and Deferred Revenue: Most industrial and commercial organizations have not adopted a new-style accounting system. When closing accounts, they often do not pay attention to the accounts that need to be organized for accounts receivable, uncollected, accounts payable, unpaid, prepaid, and deferred revenue, or they do not organize them, or even if they do, they only focus on relatively significant items. They believe that these accounts receivable and uncollected, accounts payable and unpaid, can be recorded when they are received or paid in the future. As for the prepaid and deferred revenue accounts, since there is no longer any monetary inflow or outflow relationship, there is no need to organize them. They do not know that the periodic closing of accounts is originally for the purpose of clearly understanding the operating situation and profit and loss figures of each year. Only when the profit and loss calculation within an accounting year can accurately reflect the profit and loss situation of that year can the effectiveness of accounting be brought into play. Therefore, when closing accounts, all accounts receivable and uncollected, accounts payable and unpaid must be checked and transferred, and the same applies to prepaid and deferred revenue accounts. Deferred revenue is a deferred liability and should be transferred out of revenue, and prepaid expenses are deferred assets and should be transferred out of losses. All must be calculated proportionally according to time and organized, and then the annual profit and loss calculation and the ending asset and liability situation can be accurate. Income tax is based on the accurate annual net profit as the basis for collection, which further highlights the importance of the accounting principles described in this article.</p>
<p>㊂ Valuation of Inventory: Article 27, Paragraph 2 of the General Rules for Chinese Merchants stipulates that the current price should be noted in the preparation of the property inventory. When the market price is higher than the original price, the original price must be recorded. The first item of the asset valuation method attached to the draft collection guidelines for the first category stipulates that the valuation of assets should be based on the original price unless otherwise specified in this method, and when the original price is higher than the market price, the market price should be the standard. Although the wording is not the same, the principle of which to take, market price or original price, is the same. In the past, industry and commerce often arbitrarily expanded or contracted the year-end inventory valuation discount. Generally, in years with generous surpluses, the inventory was depreciated to a lower value. In years with little surplus or losses, the inventory was arbitrarily valued high, and the unsold goods stored over the years were also included at a high price to reduce losses or increase profits. This approach is actually putting the cart before the horse and deceiving oneself. The current income tax law clearly stipulates the method for valuing goods, and the above-mentioned malpractices can be corrected as a result.</p>
<p>㊃ Depreciation of Fixed Assets: The types of fixed assets, the shortest useful life determined based on their structural conditions, and the maximum depreciation rate, and the valuation standards are all specified in great detail in the asset valuation method. Whether these regulations are reasonable and whether there are any obstacles in their application is certainly a problem. However, giving industrial and commercial organizations a unified standard so that the malpractice of arbitrary expansion and contraction in the past no longer occurs is also a commendable thing.</p>
<p>㊄ Elimination of Bad Debts: In theory, there are two types of methods: "comprehensive estimation method" and "individual elimination method." However, one cannot be used at the same time. The current law adopts the individual elimination method. Article 19 of the Asset Valuation Method stipulates that receivables, accounts receivable, notes receivable, and various debts, etc., may be listed as losses if one of the following circumstances occurs: ㊀ Part or all of the creditor's rights cannot be recovered due to bankruptcy, absconding, or declaration of bankruptcy, or other reasons; ㊁ The creditor's rights have been overdue for two years, and the principal or interest has not been collected after legal collection. This is the meaning of this. The intention of the law is still lenient and can remedy the freedom to estimate bad debts and expand or contract profits and losses.</p>
<p>㊅ Amortization of Intangible Assets: Business rights and copyrights acquired by bidding and used as assets must be fully amortized within ten years. Trademark rights, exclusive rights, and other various franchise rights, etc., are each amortized to completion according to the legally enjoyed number of years after their acquisition.</p>
<p>㊆ Amortization of Organizational Expenses: At least five years for the shortest period.</p>
<p>㊇ Deadline for Settlement Report and Tax Payment: According to the meaning of Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations and Article 26 of the Implementing Rules, the business year is from January 1 to January 31, and those who close accounts according to the lunar calendar must complete the settlement matters before the end of February. Those who use July 1 to June 30 of the following year as the business accounting year must complete the settlement before the end of July. The three months from March 1 to May 31 in the first half of the year are the declaration and tax payment period, and the period from August 1 to October 30 in the second half of the year is the declaration and tax payment period. According to the provisions of Article 33 of the Implementing Rules, the period for the competent collection authority to determine the amount of income tax is within 15 days of receiving the taxpayer's declaration. Therefore, the deadline for declaration should be 15 days earlier than the deadline for tax payment, that is, May 16 for the first half of the year and October 15 for the second half of the year.</p>
<p>㊈ Documents for Declaration: Fill out the Category A Report Form for Income Amount of the First Category, and submit the property inventory as a balance sheet, profit and loss statement, or other accounting documents to prove the income amount. In the property inventory, the difference between the original price and the market price of each item of property and its estimated price category should also be noted. What should be explained here is that the net income listed in the report form is completely different from the net profit listed in the profit and loss statement. The most obvious difference is the deduction of the statutory reserve fund. In addition, items that are incorrectly listed or should not be deducted must also be adjusted separately before the declaration. In various countries in Europe and the United States, in order to save time and avoid the risk of illegality, industrial and commercial organizations often entrust accountants to handle this type of adjustment work to achieve perfection. The above-mentioned points are nothing more than elaboration based on personal observation and reference to the content of laws and regulations. Income tax has been implemented. After implementation, the difficulties that we actually feel will be ten or a hundred times greater than we expected. It is hoped that the wise officials of the collection authorities can cooperate with taxpayers to overcome these inevitable difficulties. The foundation of a good income tax system and the future of its advancement will be laid here. That is what I sincerely pray for. (End)</p>

<h3>Train Collides with Car Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>At the Intersection of Qingyang Port and Xihu Highway, Car Smashed, One Westerner Seriously Injured and Died</p>
<p>Yesterday, the fourth upward special express train on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway left Shanghai at 8:35 a.m. It was towed by C-type locomotive No. 11 and No. 12. When it passed the Qingyang Port station and the gate of the Xihu Highway, a Willis brand small car driven by a Westerner on the highway was also speeding towards it. The car's concession registration was No. 3194, and the municipal government registration was No. 7322. The Westerner seemed to want to cross the intersection of the railway and the highway in front of the train. Unexpectedly, the train was also speeding forward at full speed. However, the horsepower of the small car was ultimately limited, and the driver still overestimated himself and rushed forward, causing it to collide violently with the second locomotive C-type No. 12 of the fourth train at the intersection. The car was thrown more than ten feet away by the locomotive and fell into the rice field west of the highway. The car body was shattered, and the Western driver's head was broken and blood splattered everywhere. The train attendants and locomotive drivers also stopped the train urgently and went to check. They saw that the Westerner was beyond help. There was a Western doctor on the train, so they asked him to give first aid, but he ultimately died due to serious injuries. Therefore, he died shortly after. The train conductor, etc., went to Kunshan Station to report and telegraphed the railway bureau for instructions. At the same time, the station dispatched a police chief to the scene of the accident to conduct an on-site investigation. Next to the deceased's body, they copied out many business cards and more than forty yuan in paper money. The business cards were printed with "G. Liebsch" and "Technical Department of Yali Foreign Company, 410 Sichuan Road, Shanghai" and other words. Therefore, they learned the deceased's surname and that he was of German nationality. Since the train was not damaged, it continued to run immediately. After receiving the report from Kunshan Station, the Kunshan County Government also sent personnel to investigate and took photos of the deceased and the destroyed car one by one. They also ordered the local security to temporarily guard the corpse and wait for the examination this morning before the family members could claim the body. They have also sent personnel to notify Yali Foreign Company to inform the deceased's family members.</p>
<h3>What Happened to Luo Pu?</h3>
<p>Responsibility Lies with the Boatwoman</p>
<p>The No. 5 municipal ferry running the Gaoqiao Banqiao route collided with a sampan while returning to Shanghai in the evening of the 6th of this month at the Pudong Xidu Wharf due to improper turning. A ferry passenger, Kang Genfa (37 years old), a native of Pudong, who worked as a packing coolie for the Japanese-owned Iwai Yoko, fell into the river and drowned. The Customs Water Police Station did not determine who was responsible for the accident, but the two boatwomen, Wang Zhou, a native of Shandong, and Wang Han, a native of Jiangbei, were suspected of negligence in their duties, resulting in death. Yesterday, Detective Shi A Jin was sent to summon the two defendants and send them to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Pei Gaolu抢救管</p>
<p>Pei Gaolu, a native of Changzhou who used to work as a coolie at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou, was watching goods at the wharf at about 7 p.m. the night before. At that time, five water pipes were unloaded from the British ship Lunqi. Because they rolled to the edge of the wharf, Pei stepped forward to rescue them, and both he and the pipes fell into the river. When others noticed, it was too late to save him. He sank without a trace. Customs Water Patrol sent Detective Yao Guofa to investigate the incident and wait for the body to be recovered before reporting for an examination.</p>
<p>Unstable Footing, Falls Down</p>
<p>Also, at 2:15 p.m. yesterday, Chen Shi, a ship repair worker from Guangdong on the British ship Behar, which was berthed at Waipu Xin in Hongkou, accidentally fell onto the No. 43 iron barge berthed next to the ship while working on the Three Calendar Scaffold. His head, arms, buttocks, and other parts were severely injured. The Customs Water Patrol detective Long Qingyun carried him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Gambling Case Cracked at the Xin Xin Hotel</h3>
<p>Defendants Fined</p>
<p>Liu Ya Ying, the Chinese detective head of the Old Gate Patrol Room, learned that someone was gambling in Room 810 of the Xin Xin Hotel on Guizhou Road, profiting by taking commissions. At 11:15 p.m. the night before, he led detectives to the hotel and arrested eight gambling offenders, including Ni Shenrong, Jin Zifu, Wu Ronggen, and Jiang Xia. They seized a pair of dominoes, two dice, and thirteen yuan in paper money, and took them all to the patrol room, where they were detained separately. Also, the Chinese and Western detectives of the New Gate Patrol Room arrested eighteen gambling offenders, including Wang Zhang, Shao Rensi, Zhao A Yu, and Wang Li, at No. 5, Lane 253, Meibai Ge Road, at 11 p.m. last night. Together with a set of mahjong tiles, a set of sand flower tiles, a pair of dominoes, and the gambling money, they were taken to the patrol room and detained. Yesterday morning, they were successively sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court, where the patrol room lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a lawsuit according to law. After Judge Jin questioned them one by one, he ruled that each defendant should be fined separately, and the gambling equipment and gambling money should be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Defense Committee Passes Budget Draft</h3>
<p>Including the Volunteer Corps, Fire Department, and Police Department</p>
<p>The draft budget for this year's Shanghai Municipal Council's Volunteer Corps, Fire Department, and Police Department has been submitted to the Council's Board of Directors by the Council's Defense Committee for review by the Finance Committee. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Volunteer Corps</p>
<p>(Explanation) This year's expenditure is 88,710 yuan less than last year's. The terms of office of the adjutant and artillery instructor have expired, and it is proposed to abolish their vacancies, which can save salaries of 5,960 yuan. Uniform fees are reduced by 13,400 yuan compared to last year. It is not planned to add military equipment this year, so the purchase cost of products has been saved a lot. The transportation fee has increased by 3,000 yuan due to the addition of vehicles. The expenditure of the Russian team will be reduced by 15,680 yuan due to the salary schedule agreed upon, which will take effect from July 10 this year. A special expenditure item includes the cost of purchasing two trucks, totaling 6,800 yuan. According to the opinion of the Finance Director, the budget has been reduced as much as possible, so there is no room for further savings in various expenditures.</p>
<p>㊁ Fire Department</p>
<p>(A) Special Expenditure: The expenditure required for the new central fire brigade is estimated at 1,000,000 yuan, and the expenditure for the new branch offices in various districts is estimated at 1,200,000 yuan, all of which have been eliminated. The expenditure required for the expansion project of the machine room of the Hongkou branch and the remainder of the expenditure required for the temporary branch on Henan Road are both allowed to be included in the special expenditure item.</p>
<p>(B) Recurring expenditure, excluding the cost of purchasing materials and supplies and the expenditure required for ambulances, totals 506,40 yuan, saving 34,350 yuan compared to last year. It is planned to purchase two vehicles for transporting patients to hospitals, so the funding for the ambulance section has increased by 13,230 yuan.</p>
<p>㊂ Police Department</p>
<p>(Explanation) This year's expenditure is 162,240 yuan less than last year's. The reason is the implementation of the newly revised salary schedule, temporarily reducing the number of police officers, and saving various other expenditures. After the Police Department handled the affairs of the former Rickshaw Committee, the required expenditure has been included in the budget. The quota for patrolmen and probationary patrolmen was originally 313, but it is planned to temporarily use 283 this year. The rickshaw management section added one vehicle inspector, the reserve team added 16 Russian police officers (transferred from the Russian team of the Volunteer Corps), two drivers, 20 Japanese police officers, and the expenditure required for the promotion of the Chinese assistant patrol chief to inspector has also been included in the budget. The expenditure for the prisons and reformatories has decreased by 5,920 yuan compared to last year. The expenditure required for hiring a Chinese assistant warden and adding two teachers has been included in the budget. The expenditure for the special patrol section (including the purchase cost of materials and supplies) totals 30,680 yuan.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Bravely Fights Robbers</h3>
<p>A Packet of Subsidiary Coins Preserved, Robber Shoots and Injures His Left Leg</p>
<p>Sun Xiuting, a native of Zhenjiang, 19 years old, is now an apprentice at the Baoxiang Money Shop at No. 23 Tianzhutang Street, French Concession. Although Sun is young, he is naturally alert, which is why he is valued by the colleagues in the shop. At 5:30 a.m. yesterday, Sun was ordered by Qiu Deru (a native of Suzhou), the shop's accountant, to carry 200 yuan in legal tender to the Xinjingxiang Money Shop in Nandongmen, Nanshi, to exchange for nickel coins and subsidiary coins for door-to-door exchange. Sun went to Dadongmen and completed the procedures. After wrapping the exchanged subsidiary coins of various kinds in newspaper, he clamped them under his arm. When he walked to the entrance of the Sunjia Lane on Zhonghua Road, Taidongmen, three robbers suddenly jumped out from the roadside. One robber wearing a felt hat blocked the way with a gun, aimed at Sun's chest, and forbade him to make a sound. At the same time, one robber intended to snatch the paper bag that Sun was holding. Sun immediately resisted with his arm and shouted for help. Knowing that things were not good, and in order to escape, the robbers shot at Sun's lower body. The bullet hit Sun's left leg and pierced through. He fell to the ground in extreme pain. The three robbers took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The police officer at Post No. 15 nearby reported to the Yemiao Police Station. Chief Yu immediately led a large number of police officers to the scene. He first sent Sun to the Nanyang Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injury was not serious. Chief Yu ordered his subordinates and Dong Mingde, the captain of the Fifth Detachment of the Investigation Team, to investigate the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Two Robbery Cases</h3>
<p>Labu Road: Yesterday morning, three robbers came to the room at No. on Labu Road, French Concession. One robber held a pistol and forbade them to make a sound. As a result, more than 100 yuan in national currency was robbed, and the robbers escaped with the loot. Afterwards, the victim issued a loss report to the patrol room and asked them to arrest the robbers.</p>
<p>Xingsheng Street: At 8:30 p.m. last night, six robbers suddenly came to the overshoe shop at No. 90 Xingsheng Street, French Concession. Three robbers with guns entered the shop and forbade everyone to make a sound. They robbed all the more than 100 yuan sold in the counter. After obtaining the loot, they went out and fled separately. Then the shop owner, Kai Ming, issued a loss report to the Dazimingzhong Patrol Room and requested to pursue the robbers.</p>
<h3>Sun Shaoqing Indiscriminately Engages in Litigation; Patrol Room Adds Two Charges</h3>
<p>One Case is Yao Yuebo, One Case is Pan Xueyan. There is Also Zhou Xiangyun Case Handled by Sun. Court Interrogation Yesterday Ordered Prohibition of Audience</p>
<p>Sun Shaoqing, a native of Tongzhou, was suspected of indiscriminately engaging in litigation, intimidation, and defrauding money. He was arrested by the Public Patrol Room's Chinese Inspector Lu Liankui and Detective Liu Shaokui and sent to the First Special District Court. He was prosecuted according to Articles 157 and 346 of the Criminal Law for indiscriminately engaging in the Sun Wu Guizhen and Wu Dengying property division case and obtaining 40,000 yuan. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, this case was continued to be heard in the First Criminal Court by Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court. An order was issued to</p>
<p>Prohibit Audience</p>
<p>First, the patrol room lawyer Ru Baoyi claimed that, in addition to the case that had already been prosecuted last time, two more cases were added today. ㊀ Yao Yuebo (owner of Yao Renxing Construction Factory), a native of Nantong, and his brother Yao Renyi (owner of Yao Shunxing Construction Factory) jointly contracted a project. Later, Yao Renyi died, and his son Yao Zhichun inherited all the business. In the 30th year, Yao Yuebo settled the project account with his nephew and ordered him to pay 10,000 yuan in rights. Because Yao Zhichun refused, he entrusted the defendant Sun Shaoqing to negotiate. After Sun turned to</p>
<p>Entrust Zhu Nanshan</p>
<p>Doctor to mediate, the result was a settlement of 5,000 yuan, but Yao Yuebo actually only got 1,500 yuan. ㊁ The famous actress Pan Xueyan (currently living in Tongfuli, Julai Road, with Zheng Yongquan, a senior employee of Citibank), in November of the 24th year, had entrusted the defendant Sun Shaoqing to extort 20,000 yuan from Xu Maochang (owner of Dafeng Yarn Factory, brother of Xu Maotang, comprador of the Bank of England). Later, Xu entrusted lawyer Wu Linkun to</p>
<p>19,000</p>
<p>Yuan as the price to settle the case, and Pan got very little. Today, the witnesses Yao Yuebo and the two lawyers Wu Linkun and Gu Gongbing are all in court, but lawyer Chen Tingrui cannot attend due to illness. Then, Yao Yuebo's confession was presented to the court. The court immediately summoned Wu Shenbo, the son of Wu Dengying, to the case, saying that the court had inquired to your representative lawyer Chen Tingrui, who claimed that before the case was over, you had received threatening phone calls and someone</p>
<p>Following Your</p>
<p>Car, but Wu absolutely denied it. At that time, Sun Shaoqing's wife Sun Zhu was in court. After the court summoned her to the case and questioned her, she asked whether she knew that Wu Yuee had sued Zhou Xiangyun, which was handled by her husband and settled for 70,000 yuan. According to her answer, Wu Yuee had lived with her before. She had testified in court at Wu's request, but she did not know anything else. The court asked whether the case had been investigated by the court and was jointly handled by her and the deceased Tang Jiapeng. She also replied that she did not know. The patrol room lawyer Ru Baoyi immediately stated that she had</p>
<p>Accomplice Suspicion</p>
<p>The patrol room must investigate it. Then Qian Judge summoned lawyer Wu Linkun to the case. According to his testimony, on a certain day in November of the 24th year, Xu Maochang went to the back of No. 67 Fuming Village, Fuxu Road, and said that he had met Pan Xueyan because they met while watching a play or had the same dining words left in Pan's hand, causing Pan to use this as evidence that he had a relationship with him, and he needed 20,000 yuan. Now Sun Shaoqing and Cai Futang have mediated a settlement, but one must establish a</p>
<p>Never End Entanglements</p>
<p>Certificate, explaining that it has nothing to do with Pan and recalling the note. This lawyer often drafted it on his behalf. Later, because he wanted to hand over the money, on a certain day, Sun Shaoqing, Cai Futang, Pan Hongsheng, and others came to this lawyer's place and insisted that Pan must come in person before the money could be handed over. Therefore, Sun and Pan Hongsheng fought each other in this lawyer's house. After being stopped, they stopped. Afterwards, after Pan Xueyan and Sun and others came together, they finally made a statement and handed over 10,000 yuan to settle the case. Sun Shaoqing and Cai Futang are co-mediators on the certificate. Today, Xu Mao</p>
<p>Is in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Because of an accident, he could not attend the meeting and has commissioned accountant Lu Yifang to attend the meeting on his behalf. Qian Judge then questioned Lu, saying that Xu would not be able to attend the meeting until a week later. In short, Sun Shaoqing completely denied this case, saying that he had not handled the case. Qian Judge then summoned Yao Yuebo to the court. According to his confession, because my nephew did not want to give me the rights that I deserved, I was so angry that I spoke with the building owner Yin Xiangfa in the Dongxinger Tea House on Broadway and asked Yin to introduce Sun Shaoqing to handle it.</p>
<p>Four-Six Split</p>
<p>The mountain Jiang Zhaozhou wrote a contract. As a result, it was settled for 5,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, Sun only gave me 1,500 yuan, and the rest was swallowed up. There was nothing I could do. As for Sun Wu, I did introduce her. She lived in Sun's house for about a year. Sun initially demanded 200,000 yuan, then reduced it to 120,000, 70,000, and finally settled for 40,000 yuan. Sun only gave Sun Wu 11,500 yuan, and gave me 500 yuan for rewards and travel expenses. I heard Sun say that he had</p>
<p>On Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Followed Wu Dengying's car and so on. Then, lawyer Gu Gongbing proved that Sun Wu's case was handled by Sun Shaoqing four or five days before the settlement. When the money was handed over at lawyer Chen Tingrui's office, Sun was also in the room. At that time, the other party's lawyer Chen handed the bank note to me, and I handed it over to Sun Wu. I don't know what happened after that. Qian Judge asked him about the incident, and Sun still denied it from beginning to end. The court then announced that the case would be adjourned for one week for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>39 Million People Hold Parker Pens</h3>
<p>Far East Sales Account for 25 Percent</p>
<p>According to the Zilin Daily, yesterday, Mr. Parker, the general manager of the American Parker Pen Company, told the Zilin Daily representative that the pens manufactured by the company and sold in the Far East account for about 25 percent of the total. Sales have increased sharply in recent years, especially in the Philippines and India. Unfortunately, there are many counterfeits, especially in Japan.

<h3>Turning Soil into Gold</h3>
<p>A Fraud Case Involving Chemical Reactions in Medicinal Liquids Awaits Trial Conclusion</p>
<p>Bydalinko, a 46-year-old White Russian, resided at No. 304 Myers Avenue, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. He previously operated a metal jewelry store on Rue du Pere Froc. Last October, he and his translator, Li Bingzhong (a 45-year-old from Zhenjiang), went to Fuzhou to open a jewelry store. They agreed with Li Jinde, a Taiwanese man (who was a detective at the local Public Security Bureau), that Bydalinko would entrust him with selling eight and a half taels of 14-karat foreign gold. Li did not sell it. Later, Li Bingzhong sold it himself to Chen Aqian and a Ms. Lin, obtaining 968 national currency. However, the buyers later discovered that the foreign gold was made from soil as the raw material, transformed into metal through the chemical action of a certain medicinal liquid. However, it could only deceive for a short time; after a long time, it would revert to soil. They reported this to the local Public Security Bureau. Since Bydalinko and others had already returned to Shanghai by boat, an urgent telegram was sent to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. When the ship arrived in Shanghai, Bydalinko and Li Bingzhong were intercepted and transferred to the local court. Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang investigated and received confirmation from the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau that the gold bar was indeed counterfeit. The defendants confessed that they could earn 50 yuan from each yuan, so they were prosecuted for fraud. Yesterday, Judge Lu Hongze opened the court and questioned the defendants, who claimed that the gold was not counterfeit and that Li Jinde, unhappy with the 100 yuan introduction commission he received, designed a scheme to frame them. They hired a lawyer to defend them. The judge announced the end of the debate, and the verdict will be announced on the 13th. The defendants requested to be released on bail, which the judge granted after each paid a deposit of 1,000 yuan.</p>

It has now been found that those gambling inside at the time included Ala Navitongji (a journalist), Shapiro (a salesman), Guo Qiubi (a broker), Burke (a musician), Bairanasi (a salesman), and Yin Xiang Luoweiski (unemployed).

<p>Yang Rongfu, the owner of Dachang Porcelain Shop at No. 130 Kai Zi Er Road, French Concession, from Wuxi, had his six-year-old son Huiqi kidnapped by his hired rickshaw puller Cai Fuxing, who conspired with others to hide him, and then sent a letter demanding 5,000 yuan for ransom. He also sent a party member, Wu Jinshu, to contact the victim's family with the shoes worn by Huiqi, and agreed on a price of 1,000 yuan. Yang prepared the money and went to the agreed location, but no one from the gang came to collect the money and hand over the ticket. The incident was leaked, and Cheng Yunyu, a tailor from Wuxi who lived near the Eight Immortals Bridge, used the name of the kidnapper to send a letter to Yang Rongfu, asking him to prepare 3,000 yuan to contact the ransom ticket at the Xinxin Hotel, in order to defraud money. Yang Rongfu was afraid of being defrauded again, and reported the information to the French police, who sent a detective in disguise to the Xinxin Hotel and arrested Zhang Yunyu.

The first defendant, Cai Fuxing, the rickshaw puller used by the victim, secretly discussed with the gang members Wu Jinshu and Shi Dehong, and the fugitive Gao Jinshi and Zhang Zhenyi, at the Tiger Stove across from Fuxingli. On January 27, Yang Rongfu went to Nanjing for business, and Cai Fuxing sent him to the North Station. Cai believed that the opportunity had arrived, so he kidnapped Huiqi and sent him to the boat. The ransom price was 5,000 yuan, but was finally negotiated for 1,000 yuan. Wu Jinshu was entrusted to carry Huiqi's shoes to show trust. Later, Zhang Yunyu sent a letter to Yang demanding ransom. The police received the report from the victim and were able to solve the case. After full investigation, Chen Shoupeng was found to be unrelated to the case and will not be prosecuted. He requested that he be released first. The four defendants Cai Fuxing, Wu Jinshu, Shi Dehong, and Zhang Yunyu were prosecuted according to Article 264 and Lu 136 of the Criminal Law for kidnapping and extorting money and fraud.

Yao still refused to accept the judgment and filed a third appeal with the Supreme Court. Since his arrest and detention, it has been two and a half years. Now it is known that the Supreme Court has reviewed the case file and found that the facts of the case were not fully understood. Therefore, the court ruled to revoke the original judgment and remand the case to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. It is reported that the Third Branch of the High Court has received the judgment documents and case files issued by the Supreme Court and will conduct a trial soon.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>
<p>— (Yan Chonglou)</p>
<p>Work is life.</p>
<p>Today's achievements are the result of yesterday's hard work; today's poverty is the result of yesterday's leisure!</p>
<p>Where there is work, there is survival.</p>
<p>People cannot endure forced labor, so they must be able to work automatically.</p>
<p>Leisure is not necessarily happiness, and work is not necessarily pain.</p>
<p>You can tell that a person who labors tirelessly for work all day long is definitely an excellent member.</p>
<p>Doing more work can eliminate delusions.</p>
<p>After doing a difficult job, you will find that the job is not very difficult.</p>
<p>If today's work is not finished, it will take up the place of tomorrow's work!</p>
<p>Working alone in a team of workers is as uncomfortable as laboring alone in a group of idlers.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of system society becomes, people cannot be without work.</p>

<h3>Ba'an Situ Temple</h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Nanjing Road in Shanghai is the most prosperous long road. At the same time, because it is too materially civilized, it is also known as the Great Road, saying that it is the first road in Shanghai. But civilization is civilization, but there is an 18th-century superstitious thing there! What do you say? It is the Ba'an Situ Temple (commonly known as Rainbow Temple) recorded in this article.</p>
<p>I have been in Shanghai for a long time, but I have never visited it. The reason is that there are many things in Shanghai that have a name but no reality. Therefore, even if I pass by its door, I have never paid attention to it.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was bored, so I went to Nanjing Road to run around, which made me pay attention to Ba'an Situ Temple. After discussing it with my companions, I finally ran in and visited for more than ten minutes.</p>
<p>This temple is originally next to the Taikang Food Company, with a one-room facade. There are five golden characters on the door plaque: "Ba'an Situ Temple". Stepping over the threshold, you will find vendors selling Buddhist beads, Buddhist books, and supplies for seeking gods and chanting scriptures. On both sides are plaques with the words "Every wish is fulfilled", which were all donated by believers. In the center stands an unknown statue of a god, standing tall and majestic. Further inside is the main hall. Perhaps the incense is too strong? It makes people unable to open their eyes when they go in, and the people who burn incense and worship are very crowded; there are also many women who sell their bodies and sell their personality, also holding incense and kneeling very piously. It is said that the business is better after worshiping. I can't help but laugh secretly. The divine way teaches people to pay attention to sex, then isn't that god not righteous? This may be the mystery of what they call "Every wish is fulfilled"?</p>
<p>Turning into the left wing is a fortune-telling and divination bodhisattva who helps people match marriages by dismantling characters. Wearing black glasses, wearing a blue robe, and a meta-colored mandarin jacket, he sits upright, with a table in front of him, and an incense burner on the table, with an incense stick in it, and it is lit! Is it a god? Is it a person? I really can't tell. So I ran out dubiously.</p>
<p>Back on the road, the scene in front of me seemed to have changed to: "Why is superstition so rampant in China?" My companion asked me. I seemed speechless and could only smile bitterly at him.</p>

<p>Chapter 11 (Whispering Words Touch the Merciful Curtain, Repenting of Affection, Committing Filial Piety, Sad Autumn Light, Emerald Eyebrows Touch the Scene, Writing Feelings)</p>
<p>When he went out the door with his book bag, Xiao Ju also followed him to the outside of the gate, holding the door frame and standing on the stone door frame looking at his back. After he walked a few steps, she gently called out "Miss". Meng Lan turned around and asked him what was the matter. Xiao Ju smiled and said nothing was the matter. Meng Lan said: "You little thing, you're making fun of me. What did you call me for?" After speaking, she walked forward. Xiao Ju followed behind, chasing a few steps, and smiled and called out: "Miss, I have something to tell you." Meng Lan said: "If you have something to say, just say it, what are you doing acting so sneaky." Then she stopped and turned around to look at him and said: "What do you want to say, just say it." Xiao Ju pressed a finger to her lips, slightly raising her head, looking at his face. She said: "If I tell Miss, you will be even more worried." Meng Lan smiled and said: "If you're afraid of me being worried, then you don't have to tell me." Xiao Ju turned around, touched the end of her braid, and drew on the ground with her feet and said: "Miss treats me very well, if I don't say it, my conscience will not let me." These words aroused Meng Lan's attention, so she stood still and did not move, looking at him and said: "Tell me, what is so important. You always know my character, I will definitely not say that you told me." Xiao Ju looked back at her own door, took a step closer, leaned against Meng Lan, and whispered: "Miss's happy day has been chosen, it's September 24th. Master's intention was to tell you long ago. Madam said that she had told Miss long ago, she would be naughty long ago. It's better to tell Miss when the day is right in front of her. I feel very sad for Miss in my heart, how can such a big thing not be told to you? But I am also timid and dare not speak up. Because last night the second young mistress spoke to you and has already told you half of it. So I just told you the other half." Hearing this, Meng Lan was stunned for a moment, and then said: "Why didn't you tell me beforehand?" Xiao Ju said: "How dare I say it beforehand? The whole family didn't mention a word." Meng Lan nodded and said: "Okay, I know, you go back." After he finished saying these words, he sighed slightly, turned around, and walked step by step towards the school road. He was originally a person with a furrowed brow, and after this conversation, a layer of melancholy was added to that delicate face. When he went, he was thinking about his thoughts and walked step by step looking at the ground. When he came back from school, he still measured the ground and walked back step by step. However, on the way, he looked up to the front from time to time. It seemed that something was feeling in the dark. When he looked up to the front, Zhang Guoqi appeared in this posture of him. Usually when the two meet, Meng Lan always pretends to be ignorant and passes by. At most, he glances at Guoqi, and in that glimpse of the eye, he represents hundreds of millions of words. (143)</p>
<p>Famous People's Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the World's Four Giants (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Chao Xi</p>
<p>Three, Mussolini, the manufacturer of Macaroni</p>
<p>The face of the terrible Mussolini of Italy is definitely not as terrible as the photos that are often seen in the news. In fact, his often appearing smile often makes those who have met him deny that the dictator has the stern face shown in the publicly photographed photos. And Mussolini's voice is extremely pleasant to hear, so some people even want to say that if this Mussolini did not aspire to the boring business of so-called politicians, but concentrated on the cultivation of singing, he would become a successor to the musician Caruso.</p>
<p>This powerful Fascist commander is now devoting his enthusiasm and energy to promoting his views to the public, but in the past he was a figure who advocated socialism. He is indeed a possessor of a dual personality. Mussolini, who often puts on a solemn face in front of the audience or when talking to important people, is clearly very different from him when he indulges in food and drink at home. This is inevitably excessive.</p>
<p>He likes to eat macaroni with homemade sauce the most. Next to his dining table, there is often a specially made steamer and a small pot containing sauce. When his servant picks up the macaroni from the steamer and respectfully presents it to him, he moves his proud nose, takes some of his family's traditional sauce with a wooden spoon to add flavor to it. After doing this, his servant brings the macaroni to the guest. It is said that a warrior who was hated by Mussolini once rejected the macaroni made by the dictator himself, so he was exiled to an island in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Four, the Eloquent Hitler</p>
<p>Hitler, the leader of the National Socialist Party who burned books, exiled Jews, and used extremely oppressive political means, was originally just a soldier nineteen years ago. His full body still contains the spirit of that time. Recently, he often wears a collarless morning suit, just like an athlete. He is trying to show his leisurely attitude, but he still wants to find American journalists to confront: "What I personally hate the most is so-called criticism, which only makes the problem more complicated. Now Germany is in a very difficult period. In the fourteen years since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, 224,000 Germans have committed suicide. Isn't that four people committing suicide a day? Germany did not even have more than 60,000 people killed in the war with France in 1870?..." (Interview with journalists in 1933) This is simply using a speech tone even when speaking alone, and he is indeed worthy of being an eloquent debater.</p>
<p>Feature</p>
<h3>Sai Jinhua's Burial Site, Taoranting</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiaokan</p>
<p>After the death of Sai Jinhua, a heroine of her generation, in Peiping, her funeral was desolate, and her family was almost unable to bury her. Fortunately, some philanthropists recalled Sai's merits in running for the country in those years, and everyone generously donated money to bury her next to Taoranting on the southern outskirts of the city. If Sai knew, she should die without regret.</p>
<p>It is said that Taoranting was built by Jiang Zao, a doctor of the Qing Dynasty, with his own funds. The foundation of the pavilion is very high, with winding corridors and rooms, from which you can see the scenery of Peiping from afar.</p>
<p>However, this is all suburban scenery, and it is very desolate and lonely; therefore, when people on the edge of the city get tired of their lives and die, they always move to that place to make a place of return. "Only thousands of graves are seen in Beiman" is right here!</p>
<p>However, the cemeteries in the four suburbs of Peiping are not as few as in our inland areas; why do you let "Taoranting" become famous alone? This also has a literary origin. In the dense mounds of barren tombs, you can find some parallel four and six beautiful and sad sentences.</p>
<p>Let's first take the Fragrant Tomb as an example:—This is a desolate ancient tomb overgrown with weeds and has become a fox den and rat hole. The descendants are scattered, the barley rice has been empty for a long time, and the broken stele and broken monument have been messed up. However, on that gray-black stone tablet, you can still vaguely identify some wonderful texts:</p>
<p>"Vast sorrow, vast calamity! The short song ends, the bright moon is missing, the lush city of beautiful people, there is blue blood in it, the blood will sometimes run out, the moon will sometimes disappear, a wisp of fragrant soul will never be cut off! Is it or is it not? Transform into a butterfly!"</p>
<p>There is also a seven-character quatrain, which is also quite readable, and the text says:</p>
<p>"The fluttering wind and rain are pitiful, the fragrant dreams are hazy and full of green Ting: the fallen peaches are exhausted and the plums are strong, it is unbearable to reread the inscription for burying flowers."</p>
<p>What kind of person is buried in this ancient tomb after all? We don't know. According to the locals there: it is the burial place of Qian Yun, a famous prostitute from the past; but some say that it is the secret tomb of Concubine Xiang of that year. Everyone has different opinions, and no one can be sure. ——Just twenty years away from Xiang Tomb, there is also a Parrot Tomb, which also has an inscription:</p>
<p>"Literature is the source of misfortune: wisdom is the source of misfortune, alas, writing fu hurts Zheng Ping."</p>
<p>It is said that this tomb is the place where a famous writer in a certain era burned his manuscripts. He suffered a major stimulation and had nowhere to vent his hatred. He hated it and burned all the manuscripts, burying the ashes underground. What a pity!</p>
<p>Sai Jinhua's life deeds are worth singing and crying: both sad and beautiful, compared to the aunt who just uses her beauty to win people's love, her personality is a hundred times higher, and it is simply incomparable! Now that she is buried in this place, that is the best it can be.</p>
<p>——The seven-character quatrain eulogy on the "Fragrant Tomb" can also be transferred to Sai!....</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Ambassador Xu's Luck</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>The other day, the newly appointed Japanese Foreign Minister, Sato Naotake, met with the diplomatic corps and spoke with the ambassadors for a short time. However, he spoke with Xu Shiying, our ambassador to Japan, for a long time. This was because Ambassador Xu was about to return to China. On the 6th, Xu Shiying left Beijing and set off for home. The Japanese side also held a grand farewell party to express their goodwill. Exchanges between envoys are related to international etiquette, and there should naturally be expressions of welcome and farewell. However, the Japanese side's enthusiastic hospitality this time was truly rare.</p>
<p>Sato also expressed to Ambassador Xu that he had always believed in the necessity of peace between China and Japan and would strive to realize this long-held view in the future. He had long admired Ambassador Liangqing Xu's personality and hoped that Ambassador Xu could return to his post soon and make contributions to Sino-Japanese relations together. Ambassador Xu must have been flattered by this expression of goodwill and sweet tone.</p>
<p>The other side is now shouting the slogan of economic cooperation. It seems that the weapons of war between China and Japan are about to turn into silk and jade, and the ominous and inharmonious atmosphere is changing. Therefore, there are even more far-reaching expectations for Xu's return this time, so the hospitality is also extraordinarily thoughtful. Xu was fortunate enough to witness this grand occasion, which was perhaps beyond his original wishes. However, although Xu is the ambassador to Japan, the diplomatic policy must adhere to the intentions of the central authorities and cannot be freely dealt with. However, Ambassador Xu's responsibility is to assist the government where it falls short on one hand, and to directly negotiate with the Japanese side on the other hand. His important position is self-evident. Therefore, Xu's receipt of this generous treatment is also due to his position and prestige.</p>
<p>However, while the other side is calling for economic cooperation, so-called economic survey teams are coming to China in batches to conduct on-the-ground surveys. On the other hand, they are greatly increasing their troops in North China and conducting large-scale exercises, completely intending to control and occupy by force. This kind of two-faced action is the same as saying that the other side's diplomacy is dualistic, or even that it is a coordinated unity that responds internally and externally. Under these circumstances, who really believes that there is a possibility of friendship?</p>
<p>Although our country is the only peace-loving country in the world, we will never allow ourselves to be deceived or played with under this two-pronged oppression. We will never turn a deaf ear to it, never rub against it, and once it becomes a fait accompli, it will be even more difficult to discuss with them. Ambassador Xu is stationed in their country, and his understanding of the internal situation of their country and the observations of the outside world must be deeper. He will definitely have high and great opinions to contribute to the government, and he will never be satisfied because of international etiquette and consider it a sign of friendship between the two countries.</p>
<p>In private exchanges, if someone suddenly becomes intimate with you for no reason, or becomes cold for no reason, then you must investigate the reason between their coldness and intimacy and understand the truth before you can deal with them. Otherwise, you will be deceived, and it will be too late to regret it. Moreover, Ambassador Xu shoulders the heavy responsibility of the country, and the country relies on Ambassador Xu to deal with and negotiate. The importance of his relationship is self-evident. I deeply hope that Ambassador Xu can truly understand the situation on the other side.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Chen Bo'er and Others</h3>
<p>— Xiao Mei</p>
<p>Ms. Chen Bo'er, representative of the "Shanghai Women and Children's Suiyuan Front Comfort Group," and others have returned. Simultaneously appearing in the newspapers are numerous articles commemorating March 8th (International Women's Day). The arguments in these articles are mostly correct, demanding national and personal liberation, and seeking to become "upright individuals" equal to men in a free world.</p>
<p>In politics and law, Chinese women are equal to women in other countries and equal to men. But what about in education? Although the law stipulates that men and women have the right to equal education, the number of so-called intellectual women graduating from universities, and even returning from studying abroad, is not small in China today. However, if we broaden our perspective, how many women are backward, toiling like beasts of burden their whole lives, and unaware of what education is? Due to economic dependence, what is the difference between educated and properly educated women compared to men?</p>
<p>Many sages have said that "women are doubly enslaved," which is not an exaggeration. Generally, women, like ordinary male laborers, are subordinates. In gender relations, in this male-centered society, they are also slaves. And in this "ancient country of the East," China, the remnants of feudalism have not died out, and the insults and damages they suffer exceed those of other so-called civilized countries.</p>
<p>The experiences of Chen Bo'er and her group in going north to comfort the troops provide a good example.</p>
<p>It is said that when Chen Bo'er and her group first went north to comfort the troops, they were treated very favorably by all parties. The reason for this favorable treatment is ridiculous: because Chen Bo'er is a movie star. In the minds of many, movie stars are not much different from social butterflies. Therefore, the so-called troop comforting was largely a pretext. But unexpectedly, upon meeting them, they found no seductive adornments or frivolous behavior. And after arriving in Suiyuan, they even unexpectedly performed several plays that could not be performed in the interior. In this way, the notion that movie stars are playthings for accompanying people to restaurants, eating, and dancing was indeed shattered by facts. And the "favorable treatment" that followed, the inability to perform, and the various threats, were originally "deserved."</p>
<p>Chen Bo'er and others are relatively well-placed, awakened intellectuals in society. Their "national duty," which they performed to comfort themselves, encountered such obstacles and misinterpretations. What kind of insults and damages will other women, living in darkness and toiling endlessly, suffer?</p>
<p>The reason for being "obstructed" may perhaps be explained as "weak nation": (but we do not understand why even a "weak nation" cannot fulfill the national duty of its citizens!) But what is the reason for being misinterpreted?</p>
<p>To break through "obstruction," we must proceed with the goal of seeking national liberation. And to avoid being misinterpreted and insulted, we must not only use facts to silence those slanderous mouths and hearts, but also seek a comprehensive solution to the problem of economic dependence.</p>
<p>If women's economic rights cannot be established independently, then women will be slaves to men for life, and being misinterpreted is a small matter.</p>
<h3>Sai Jinhua (2)</h3>
<p>— Chen He</p>
<p>Sai Jinhua mingled with Jin Yunxian on various flower boats for more than just a day, and the news finally reached her grandmother's ears. In her sacred concept of chastity, such a spectacle of accompanying people to drink and providing entertainment was not allowed. "But what can be done in this social system! It's economic oppression!" After Sai Zhou's repeated persuasion, following the tide, Sai Jinhua became a prostitute from then on.</p>
<h3>A French Female Journalist Describes the Scenery of Madrid</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>I arrived in Madrid at this time, which can be considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The streets in the city were full of garbage because no street cleaners were working; the chairs in the park were all scattered and lying on the ground; the shops were all closed, some with broken glass windows, some with signs removed, and some with iron sheds collapsed, blocking the doors, so people had to bend down and crawl to get in and out. The clocks had all stopped, and the post office had been burned inside, but the magnificent exterior still remained. The key points on all sides were blocked with mailbags, but I don't know if the bags contained family letters that had never been delivered and that people were eagerly waiting for. One newspaper office had a barrier made of unsold newspapers in front of the door, with a few pots of holly trees arranged on top, like those seen in front of Parisian taverns. Strong men had to undergo military training for half a day every day, so food stores only opened in the morning, and customers waited in rows. Some shops opened in the afternoon. One exquisite shop, specializing in foreign-imported men's clothing, was still selling its stock, and the customers were mostly officers. The shops next door had been completely destroyed, but it stood alone, probably relying on the French or other flags it hung. The most useful luxury goods in the store were exquisite dinnerware and similar items, which are still left now because no one cares about them. The opportunistic transactions were all hawked along the street, and some of them were Chinese, selling items needed by soldiers, such as portable knives, shaving supplies, felt hats, cheap gems, and fake beads. I don't know where these things came from or how they could be transported to Madrid. Some of the vendors set up stalls on the sidewalks of "Gran Vía" or spread out their wares for sale next to the huge craters formed by artillery shells in "Puerta del Sol." Because there were many bomb craters on the ground, the trams were very careful when passing by. I saw a woman feeding sheep on a green shrub field. Life in the city was chaotic and disordered. The once magnificent residences were now full of beggars and refugees who had fled from all the war-torn areas, and some had even built reed sheds inside, planning to stay for a long time. The soldiers were very generous to them, which shows that even in the midst of indiscriminate killing, people's charitable hearts have not been extinguished. Several cafes decorated in a new style were very expensive, but they were full after they opened in the afternoon. The customers were all soldiers on leave, and their clothes were of all kinds, rarely seen. Some wore Cossack hats, some wore sheepskin coats, and some were dressed in rags. Their languages were also very mixed. They were all fighters of the International Brigades, whom the Spanish people called heroes. The people only hated that they didn't have what they wanted and were willing to offer it to them if they did. Like schoolchildren, pots of sugar buns were sent to them, and they devoured them in an instant. They were very unhappy because they didn't have chocolate or marmalade to eat. Only a few cafes are left that can still supply some food. The German soldiers looked older than the soldiers of other countries, and the Spanish people trusted them very much. The soldiers of the International Brigades would say to me: "Look at us, we are all majestic and high-spirited, and we are afraid of each other when we see each other." The walls of the cafes used to be decorated very gorgeously, but now they are covered with propaganda pictures that are shocking! There is a tall red tower in Madrid, now riddled with bullet holes, and a large blue python with a swastika symbol wants to swallow it. The inspector's office is dimly lit, and the desks are covered with bedding, where the clerks sleep at night. Foreign news reporters all pass through a kitchen to reach the dining room at the bottom of the "Gran Vía Hotel" and eat at a long table. When they have time, they go to their country's embassy to linger for a while, where they can breathe some neutral air. I ate in the cellar of a Spanish newspaper, where the kitchen for the newspaper staff was located. The staff talked and laughed loudly and happily. Sometimes they even threw bread at each other playfully. We often filled our stomachs with soybeans. Nowadays, not to mention delicacies, even ordinary food is not easy to get.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Amateur Actors Will Re-stage "Demon of Lust," "Thunderstorm," "Living Like a Drunken Dream"</h3>
<p>The three plays "Demon of Lust," "Thunderstorm," and "Living Like a Drunken Dream," which were previously performed by Shanghai amateur actors, were not only highly praised in Shanghai, but also received honor in Nanjing. Important figures of the National Government and the Central Party Headquarters, playwrights Tian Han, Hua Han, Yu Shangyuan, Ma Yanxiang, Cao Yu, local literary and art circles, media celebrities, and the Counselor of the French Embassy and the Secretary of the Russian Embassy all nodded in praise after watching them.</p>
<p>Having returned from Nanjing, the manager of the Carlton Theatre has delivered more than 470 letters from Shanghai audience members requesting amateur actors to re-stage them to Mr. Zheng Junli. Among them, one was from the hand of the famous playwright Hong Shen. The executive committee of the amateurs, considering the warm hospitality of all sectors, immediately decided to perform "Demon of Lust," "Thunderstorm," and "Living Like a Drunken Dream" for seven days starting on the 12th of this month to repay the elegant wishes of all the people in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>"Street Angel"</h3>
<p>Women standing on the street late at night, wandering, enduring hunger and cold, hoping for people's pity. In the midst of the bright lights and loud singing, perhaps you have seen them smile lightly, but their souls may be weeping and groaning in the endless darkness. This sound is tragic.</p>
<p>"Street Angel" depicts the lives of these kinds of people and the movements of the lower-class professionals who are despised by people.</p>
<p>"Street Angel" is the first creation of such a theme. This new type of attempt will give the audience a new and profound impression.</p>
<p>The director, Yuan Muzhi, is familiar to people. His achievements on the stage are undeniable, and his contributions to the film industry are equally great. This "Street Angel" is his recent new work at Mingxing Film Company, a painful and profound tragicomedy.</p>
<p>Here are band trumpet players, news vendors, barbers, prostitutes... The actors include Zhao Dan, Wei Heling, Zhou Xuan, Xie Jun, Wang Jiting, Qian Qianli, and others.</p>
<p>In addition, Ms. Zhao Huishen, who is loved by audiences on the stage, will play a guest role as a prostitute in this film.</p>
<h3>"Elastic Daughter" is Coming Soon</h3>
<p>The tragic and gorgeous film "Elastic Daughter," which Yihua is about to release, has undergone a long period of half a year from the beginning of filming to completion. The theme taken for this play is a realistic drama that expounds the occupational problems of women in the metropolis and the principles of female love, making a profound determination for the young dancers wandering in the sinful metropolis.</p>
<p>The playwright of "Elastic Daughter," Pan Zienong, with his clever pen, new themes, and three dancers with different personalities, floats on the tormenting line of life, unable to see their smiles, only sad crying faces. Everyone also encounters various changes in love, and is buried in the socially hidden traps year after year, no matter how they struggle and fight, they are still confused in the darkness, where to find some bright way out. The theme of "Elastic Daughter" presents us with a history of blood and tears of dancers.</p>
<p>"Elastic Daughter" is directed by the famous director Chen Kengran. During the prosperous period of silent films, he directed a "Blood of a Dancer," leaving a very good impression. Now, repeating the old tune, using his past experience, he has handled this "Elastic Daughter" with extra care and skill, which is undoubtedly a masterpiece.</p>
<p>The three dancers in "Elastic Daughter" are played by Lu Ming, Yan Yuexian, and Zhu Qiuchen, which are very appropriately arranged. Xu Qinfang, Ma Loufen, Yu Guang, Qin Tong, Jiang Xiu, Zhao Manna, and others are all skilled in acting and play important roles. The other two male protagonists are played by Xu Ling and Shi Fu as guest roles. The neat cast makes "Elastic Daughter" get good harvest.</p>
<p>There are two songs in "Elastic Daughter," "Elastic Daughter" and "Shuang Shuang Yan," with lyrics by Pan Zienong and music by Yan Ru. The lyrics are sad and moving, and Lu Ming sings them alone. The melodious singing and profound expression have never been seen in the Chinese film industry. Moreover, "Elastic Daughter," which focuses on the theme of dancers, has not been seen in domestic films in the past. It is a valuable film recently produced by Yihua. With the film's release approaching, it is bound to cause a sensation in the Shanghai dance scene and there will be a warm grand occasion.</p>

<p>Automobile Special</p>
<h3>A New Type of Small Car with One Cylinder</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>— Two and a Half Horsepower —</p>
<p>The last issue of this journal published a photo of a small car made in the United Kingdom — named "Scoota." This car is very light. The fuel is also very economical. This small car can be said to be the smallest of the small cars made in the UK in the world. Now this car has actually been found in Shanghai. Isn't it very interesting?</p>
<p>According to Western newspapers, the "Wulin" wheel in the last issue arrived in Shanghai from Hankou. Two passengers, Mr. and Mrs. Holger, brought a smallest car. This car is called the "Scoota" special. Mr. and Mrs. Holger arrived in port in the morning and managed to get a donation certificate. So this smallest car carried them through the British Concession on Nanjing Road and straight to the Cathay Hotel. This was during the busy traffic at noon. This truly small car drove proudly on the road. According to the car owner Mr. Holger, his small car can actually run side by side with large cars that look dignified.</p>
<p>The manufacturer of "Scoota" is a British company that manufactures gasoline ships. This car can be said to be one of the best in terms of economy. The motor has only one cylinder. The horsepower is two and a half. This engine is the one used in motorcycle. The maximum speed per hour is forty-five miles. It is said that when driving in the UK, it can travel eighty miles per gallon of gasoline. This is similar to ordinary motorcycles. So this small car can truly be said to be between a small car and a motorcycle with a sidecar. But its advantage is that it does not have the high cost of a small car, nor the discomfort of a motorcycle.</p>
<p>The regular expenses of this small car are so frugal, but what is currently considered to be the fly in the ointment is that its initial purchase cost is not low. Otherwise, this car could be called the most economical four-wheeled motorcycle in the world. The car owner Holger now hopes that it can travel 60 miles per gallon of gasoline as the normal standard in the bustling streets of Shanghai. In practice, the maximum speed of this car does not seem to be very high. But it is enough for commuting in the city. Moreover, its acceleration is fast, so even if there is a high-speed turn, there will be no danger of rollover. The engine in the car is an air-cooled type. It is said that the production is very excellent.</p>
<h3>1937 Ford Body Styles</h3>
<p>Ford Motor Company. Has recently added a club coupe to its lineup of 1937 body styles. Thus, the variety of car styles to choose from is truly abundant. This new body style is most suitable for those who want a coupe for personal use, but occasionally need to carry more than two people. Among the 1937 Ford V8 body styles, five are available with or without deluxe equipment. Additionally, there are six models that fall within the deluxe range.</p>
<p>The complete list of 1937 Ford body styles is as follows: Various cars with a 60-horsepower engine – Two-door sedan, two-door touring sedan, four-door sedan, four-door touring sedan, and five-window coupe, all without deluxe equipment.

Various cars with an 85-horsepower engine with deluxe equipment – Two-door sedan, four-door sedan, convertible coupe, five-window coupe, two-door touring sedan, four-door touring sedan, club coupe, convertible sedan, convertible coupe, and club coupe.</p>
<h3>1937 Deluxe Ford Coupe</h3>
<p>As shown in the picture is a 1937 Deluxe Ford V8 four-door coupe. The front is elegant and flowing, featuring new headlights, a V-shaped windshield, and the beautiful lines unique to the 1937 style. This new car has a total of eleven deluxe body styles, five of which do not have deluxe equipment. The so-called deluxe style refers to being equipped with an 85-horsepower engine. Those without deluxe equipment are equipped with either a 60-horsepower engine or an 85-horsepower engine, as desired by the buyer. The mechanical improvements include fingertip gearshift controls and an easy-to-operate safety braking system.</p>
<h3>Automotive Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Fool</p>
<p>▲The Millionth Chevrolet  Chevrolet Motor Company has recently produced one million cars in one year. This is truly an unprecedented feat in the company's history. This one million cars includes both passenger cars and trucks manufactured. The millionth Chevrolet of 1936 was completed last winter at the Plymouth plant. At that time, Chairman Chrysler himself was present. The company's previous highest record for passenger cars and trucks manufactured was 843,599 vehicles in 1935. Chrysler, in commemorating the production of this million vehicles, stated that the achievement of this record demonstrates that the automobile manufacturing industry is a vital element of society and the economy, and is still striving forward. Twenty years ago, it required the output of 300 automobile companies to achieve one million cars in a year.</p>
<p>▲U.S. Highway Construction Costs The U.S. is making great strides in highway construction. The expenditure for 1936 has reached US$600,000,000, as compiled by the American Road Builders' Association. Since 1931, the road construction projects of last year were the most advanced. Federal funding, including various highway project costs and subsidies, accounted for approximately US$300,000,000 of the total. It is reported that the road construction expenditure for 1937 will see even greater increases.</p>
<p>▲Relationship Between Alcohol and Car Accidents British physician Vernon recently presented a report at a medical research conference regarding the relationship between alcohol abuse and car accidents. He stated that although the number of car accident incidents in England has not increased compared to 1934, the average daily number of fatalities is still 18, and the number of injured exceeds 600. Although the Ministry of Transport's statistics claim that only one in eighty incidents is due to drunk driving, based on U.S. statistics, drunk driving is indeed a major cause of accidents. Even drinking small amounts of alcohol can be detrimental, as it often unknowingly increases speed. Using Widmark's test, after examining blood or urine, the symptoms can be inferred from the alcohol content. Anyone with one part per thousand of alcohol in their blood is 40% to 60% affected by alcohol. With 1.7 parts per thousand, 80% to 88% are affected. With one part per thousand, all are affected. Therefore, Vernon concluded that drivers must eliminate alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>▲Champion Spark Plug to Build Factory in England  A factory specializing in the production of Champion spark plugs is currently being built in England. The total project cost is approximately £100,000. The factory site occupies one acre and is located in Middlesex, near London. Previously, Champion spark plugs sold in the U.S. were entirely manufactured by the Canadian Champion factory in Windsor. Various British automobiles, including Morris, Standard, Hillman, and Ford, use Champion spark plugs as standard equipment. Due to recent strong demand, the decision was made to build a factory in England. The new factory building is one story high, with an area of 33,000 square feet. All kinds of manufacturing and assembly machinery are the latest models, capable of producing spark plugs for various automobiles and aircraft.</p>
<p>▲Car Race Spoiled by Ox  The recent car race hosted by the Royal East Africa Automobile Association had a total distance of 2,715 miles. Forty-two cars participated, each with a value ranging from under £1,000. During the race, the drivers experienced many surprising incidents. Among them, driver Whisteco, number eleven, was the most unfortunate. Just one hundred miles from the finish line, he suddenly had an unexpected collision. The distance he had already covered had surpassed that of his peers. The deity who determined Whisteco's fate was an ox, which snatched the victory he had already grasped. After Whisteco's car collided, the radiator at the front of the car was severely damaged, forcing him to stop and replace it. The time lost was considerable. What is comforting is that even though Whisteco did not win the championship, he still won the second prize.</p>
<p>▲Television Sets Prohibited in Cars  Recently, the number of people installing radios in their cars has been increasing, especially in the U.S. This is due to the development of the radio industry in the U.S. and the American emphasis on entertainment. When driving out or traveling long distances, one is not lonely. In fact, installing a radio in a car can add to the fun of a holiday trip to the countryside, where music suddenly arises amidst the green fields. Otherwise, during short trips in the city, a moment of distraction can lead to accidents. At present, American enthusiasts are also planning to install television sets in their cars. This would allow one to watch in addition to listening, which would certainly be enjoyable. However, a group of people concerned about traffic safety are deeply worried that this trend will have endless consequences. Because driving a car requires the use of both hands and eyes, if the driver is momentarily inattentive, wouldn't it be a disaster? Therefore, the National Safety Council of Atlantic City has recently made a suggestion to prohibit the installation of television sets in cars. The reasons given include "Lest Mae West's image appear on the screen, leading to more car accidents that are difficult to handle." This can be said to be putting seriousness into humor.</p>
