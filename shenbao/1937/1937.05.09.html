<h3>國防綫上（四）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　叔棣</p>
<p>㊂山西印蒙記</p>
<p>“印象如何”？—我一到太原，就有一位特別性急的朋友，這麼問我：當我在那裹逗留的期間，也屢次碰到各方面的人士，提出這樣的詢問。臨離開時，有朋友到車站送我，——</p>
<p>“此行印象如何呢”？最後一次，提出了這樣的詢問。</p>
<p>以一個新聞記者地位來到的我，對這問題，怎麼回答呢？很想籠統地說：“很好很好”！或是：“各方面看起來呀，都還不錯”。然而他們在提出詢問時，往往又附帶聲明了：“不要單聽客套的稱讚話：從你這遠地的來賓方面，我們想聽聽你的具體印象，到底是怎樣”。</p>
<p>看見他們那種認真，熱烈，　摯，和謙遜的神色，我覺得，我不應當純用客套話敷衍：我應當平心靜氣地，把各方面所得的印象，歸納一下，然後再回答他們。說的對不對，是另一個問題；在我這方面，總求不辜負他們的意思，和不辜負。我這一次國防綫上旅行的使命。</p>
<p>所以，我是一直保留著以後答覆的地步的•我說：“等將來，把所得的歸納和分析以後，再說出來請教吧。”</p>
<p>不過現在呢，無論對於山西人士，無論對於本報的讀者們，已經是到了不得不說出我在山西所得的印象的時候了。</p>
<p>我想先從這一點的處所說起。這一回，我為什麼受本報派遣，有這個國防綫上的旅行，這，在上面的一釋題”裏，已經約略述過了。我的去到山西，其最大原因，就是因爲牠處在國防綫上，担負著國防前衛的任务，各種情况，為全國各界人士特別關心的緣故。我個人對於山西的希望，和全國人是敢的：希望牠在各方面，成為我們國家民族的最鞏固的前衛；因而，我在山西要看的對象呢，也和對於別的處在國防綫上的地域一樣。假如在山西所得的印象，和別的地方有些不同，那末，應該是牠表現的不同，而不是我的看法的不同。</p>
<p>上面這段話，我在山西時，一再向各方面說過；他們立刻了解了我，而且就很熱心地問：“那末，你打算看些什麼呢”！</p>
<p>我思索了一下說：“看是綜合地什麼都想看一看的，隻是勉強分一分，大概有這幾項：國防設施，經濟建設，民衆組織，……”</p>
<p>於是，他們很熱心地給予了許多便利和帮助，有時，甚至超過了，我想望中的應該給予的範圍。這樣，我完畢了對於各方面的大概的觀察。當我離開的時候，他們表現出一種非常信任的神情，向我說：“雖，你是新聞記者，負有有聞必錄的報道使命；然而，我們相信，你定能在適當方式下，把你觀察所得，和作的觀感，忠實地向國人傳播的。一他們並沒有說：“這是有關國防秘密的，謂不必發表，”或有關什麼什麼的，“請不必披露”，等等的話；而這些話呢，却是新聞記者常碰到的囑附。</p>
<p>對於他們的熱心和信任，我祗有感謝，和慚愧我自己能力的薄弱：但是，我總想把我在山四觀察所得，和我個人的觀感，竭力在“適當的方式下”，報吿出來。他們的態度，深深感動了我，我敢說，在國家民族的立塲上，我們四萬九千萬同胞的觀點，是完全一致的。</p>
<p>我仔細在腦子裏歸納分析了一下以後，假如要我說出劉於山西的整個印象麼？那末，我也舉出的，最深刻的印象，當是：山西全省人士，上自閻百川先生，趙次隴先生，各高級將領，各方面負責人士，“直至全省的全體民衆，每個人，都了解了他們在國防綫上處的地位的重要，而在那裹埋頭苦幹；同時，他們迫切地希望，和全國的同胞，携起手來，團結起來，向衛國保種的大道邁進。所以，他們很想便全國的同胞，能多多了解他們，多多協助他們；因而，也就非常願意把山西眞實的情形，向新聞記者們展露，希望經過他們的“適當報道”，忠實地傳給國人。像有些地方，視新聞記者為麻煩的人物，而行着新聞絕對封鎖的事，在山西，是沒有的。我個人這回在山西所遭受的　待，縱使不龍代表全體新聞界，不過在這裹，我很願意舉出幾件瑣事來，作為一種例證。</p>
<p>當我到太原的那兩天，正是閻白川先生最忙的時候；金憲章反正部隊的南調，全省縣長的考試，少年大檢閱，國民兵基幹人員的考試，各高級將鎭雲集，正在舉行着省防會議；……這一切，都由閻先生親自主持。（其實，山西一切的事，都由閰先生親自主持，想來他是一直在忙着的。不過據朋友告訴我，那兩天，是他特別忙的時候。）知道這情形以後，所以，當一位朋友問我是不是想見見閻先生的時候，我感到有點躊躇起來了。</p>
<p>“既然來到山西了，當然想見見閻先生致敬的。不過，你們不是說他現在特別忙麼？……我想看機會再說吧，因為我恐怕不龍逗留太久。”</p>
<p>當天，我和綏靖公署交際處的一位劉先生，同車去參觀西北實業公司的各廠，途中，我便中和他閒談到閻先生最近的忙。</p>
<p>“可不是嗎！”他說。“最近一個禮𢪙內，要見的客，巳經排好在日程上了。”</p>
<p>於是，我在心裹盤算，見閻先生的事，恐怕這趟沒有希望了：看形勢，最少要等十天，而我呢，祗打算在山西至多再停一個禮拜。</p>
<p>然而就在　第二天，有位朋友忽然跑來對我說：“我已經和閻先生說過了，他說在綏遠見過你的，聽見你來到此地、他說他打算見你談談。”</p>

<h3>民治與割據</h3>
<p>— 陶希聖</p>
<p>外國的黨派活動，是階級性的。中國的黨派活動很顯明有地方性。在外國，國內政權統一，不容於政府的黨派，只有秘密活動於民間，或竟逃亡於國外。在中國，政治還沒有完全統一，黨派不容於甲省的，可以轉入乙省。甚至不容於中央的黨派，可以在地方公然活動。不隱諱的說，在今日，中央的嚴厲的統制，使一些黨派投附於地方以求自存。為了自存，他們常畏忌統一。</p>
<p>在今日的國際情勢之下，直捷了當的反對國家的統一，是不大說得過去的。反對統一的人們，常以民主政治為理論的根據。民主政治與地方割據可以說有混淆的樣子。主張民主政治者，往往反對中央集權，而其實則袒護地方割據。要客觀一點來說，這並不是合於邏輯的理論。假如甲省乙省丙省都沒有行民主制度，則合甲乙丙諸省而成的國家並不就是民主國家。反之，假如中央政府有很大的權力，而這個集權的中央政府奉國民為主權者，惟命是聽，則這個國家不能說不是民主國家了。</p>
<p>話雖如此，在不容於政府的黨派却不會這樣看法，尤其是言談講說之士不會這樣看法：言談講說之士最宜於地方割據。不容於齊者可以往秦，而不容於楚者可以居魏。假如民主政治就是等於言論自由的話，不問秦齊楚魏是不是各行民主制度，只要他們四國是互相矛盾，則四國的聯邦就是民主國家。為什麼呢？言談講說之士可以放言高論於四國之間，不是民主又是什麼？他們可以在齊反秦，在魏反楚，不是民主又是什麼？假如齊秦楚魏成了統一國家，則游士的言談講說當然受了限制。卽令是民主國家，也還有內亂的刑章，也就沒有割據時代那樣的自由。</p>
<p>黨派紛爭與地方割據　往繳在處，這是很顯明的事實。我以為今日的中國，如果統一的過程與民主化的過程成為並進的過程，便可以减少各黨各派對於地方割據的要求的强度。我常說，不民主就不能集權，這也是一個理由。具體的說，與其讓所謂各黨各派分途助長地方的離心力，不如容他們在中央政府的會議制度之下，自由的言談講說。言談講說之士縱然可以各獲得一千兩千的信徒，却不致於像在統制之下那樣，帶有神秘的力量。與其讓好奇的青年有“關門讀禁書”的興味，不如讓他們在光天化日之下把一個一個黨派首領看過明白，化神祕為平凡。</p>
<p>最明白的近事可以作個證明。去年一年之內，言談講說之士拿句“各黨各派的聯合”出來，居然有不少的人響應。自三中全會的“澈底消滅共產黨”案公表以後，所謂各黨各派運動又到那兒去了？同樣的，對於統制，他們主張言論自由。言論果然自由了，又有什麼超自然的或超人的言論？幾句口號加上幾頂帽子的言論又有什麼號召力？</p>
<p>我在北平的報上，提出“網開三面”的要求，要求中央對於那些所謂各黨各派，宣佈一種政策說：”欲左左，欲右右，不用命者乃入吾網的”這樣可以减少地方割據的一個成因，可以收集中國力的大效。</p>

<p>言談</p>
<h3>讀“夜光杯”</h3>
<p>— 陳浮</p>
<p>近年來，中國小百姓在國事上所受的教訓，可謂深而且廣了。奴隸的運命，一天天的和我們接近；然而掙扎不得。因為抵抗須要長期，攘外必先安內，你一動，有人就要來“安”，安得你血肉糢糊，或者瘟頭瘟腦的去坐黑房子。</p>
<p>救亡的方法是多的，那些好聽的名目，記也記不清楚了。但可走的路不過兩條，小百姓還看得明白：要求生存，祗有鬥爭，不然就安心做亡國奴。</p>
<p>亡國的慘病雖難於想象，東北和冀東的暗無天日，却正是很好的前車之鑒。這幾年中，我們已經流了無數的血，而這新舊斑剝的血痕，就表現着中國民衆鐵一般堅强的求生的意志。—敵人的侵略使他們憤怒，漢奸的出賣使他們痛恨，他們願意用自己的生命給强暴者與無恥者以答復。</p>
<p>這就是我們所看見的慷慨悲壯的種種史實！</p>
<p>前些時候，報紙上登過一則新聞，記載着一位女性在冀東殉難的壯劇。那是一個舞女，可是愛國的熱情使她擔任了英勇的角色，她跑到冀東去，謀殺殷汝耕，不幸計泄，結果反受了屠戮。這舞女的熱情曾經使無數人感動，最近且見之於文藝上的反映。—尤兢先生的近著“夜光杯”，就是根據這史實創作的五幕劇。</p>
<p>自然，這樣的救國行動很有些傅奇性，這位殉難的女性也帶着英雄主義的色彩，正如一夜光杯作者所說，這種“近於虛無”的傾向，是不足為訓的。然而可貴的是她那種磅礴的熱情，嫉惡如仇的凜然的正義！</p>
<p>大人先生正在不滿於文藝家的“祇說病症，不開藥方”，而北平的特種文人，日處於烏烟瘴氣的區域，不以為逆，倒反從國防文學上嗅出“海洛英氣味”來。“夜光杯”正是一部極優秀的國防戲劇，雖然也沒有開着什麼藥方”，却很值得愛好文藝者的一讀。最好是將它搬上舞台。—因為“夜光杯”不僅寫出了一個女性的英勇和熱情，而且從這裹照徹了漢奸的醜態，和傀儡政治下的黑暗，混沌！</p>

<h3>苦行僧</h3>
<p>— 陸嘉</p>
<p>我曾在半山腰的小莊裹營一所石屋，在裹面度過幾個閑散的寒暑。</p>
<p>初夜，當我正徘徊於夢的邊緣，一聲凄淸的鑼聲落到我的枕上，使我從朦朧裹醒過來。</p>
<p>我熟悉這個鑼聲。從我遷居到山中來，牠每晚代替着山莊的柝聲，從初夜到三更。今晚，這嫠婦的泣訴似的顫慄的音波又順着上山的石路，漸慚挨近我的小窗。鑼聲前還有一個高吭而凄厲的宣佛聲：</p>
<p>南—無—阿—彌—陀—佛</p>
<p>餘韻簌簌地索抖着，最後便隱沒在蒼然的鑼聲裹。走近時我可以聽見一個個沉重的脚步，雜在鑼聲宣佛聲間。</p>
<p>鑼聲震得窗紙和庭前的樹葉子悉悉地抖起來了。</p>
<p>我想起山上𡽡險的路，想起為寒露浸透的芒鞋，想起喊出絕望的佛號的老苦行僧。這老僧不怕山上噬人的毒蛇和比毒蛇更可怕的寂寞嗎？</p>
<p>我也記起山間關於老僧的傳說：為贖自己年青時所鑄下的大錯，超度一個少女的亡魂，他半路捨棄了頭髪，披起袈裟。又按照佛家贖孽的規矩，每晚他敲着鐲，幾步一拜地走上山又走下山；轉幾個灣幾個曲折；到天明才回到廟宇裹去。他每晚點着燈籠，為那陷在輸迴的少女照明幽冥的路；為着那不能忘記的愛情，他勇敢地走上這跒跘的山徑。不管是三冬落雪，陰天，颶風，驟雨，閃雷……他踏着堅實的步子走了將近三十年的夜路。把自己隱在心底的創痛，藉着鑼和宣佛聲述說給山嵐聽。</p>
<p>因為這一個凄艷的故事，我愛在半夜捨棄被窩裹的溫暖，推開小窗，把頭探在清冷的寒風，等候那飄起的鑼聲。</p>
<p>我看見一隻透紅的燈籠，夜海上的漁燈似地，輕輕地在簿暗的夜裹飄搖。沿着山間的石徑，一會兒現，一會兒又為亂樹叢，懸崖所掩。逐漸搖近的時候，紅燈籠暈暗的光影裹便有一個老僧的輪廓現出來。胸前縣鑼，一手柱杖，一手有念珠與鑼鎚。袈裟的邊緣已被荊棘掛破，而且沾滿了泥土，就像幾度跌倒又爬起似的。</p>
<p>我不能清楚地審視他的臉，只藉着暗紅的燈光看見他飄揚在胸前的白鬚。似乎他還有端肅的面型，修整的鼻端。雖然一層憂鬱蒙上他衰老的臉，却依稀殘留舊日的丰采。兩雙眼睛放射莊嚴與堅忍的光，探測前面崎嶇的路。</p>
<p>他走得很艱難，幾步一次的跪拜又使他不能走快些。只因這老僧已有過高的年紀，風兩又摧毀了他的身體，若沒有拐杖的帮助，他幾乎不能起立了。可是他仍毫不茍且地跪下去，嘴裹還默念着不可知的經咒，從他莊嚴的態度看來，該是為那逝去的姑娘的吧！</p>
<p>走到我的窗下他的神情看上去很疲倦了，雖然掙扎着，步子却顯得凌亂，而且輕浮。每次拜下去都有站不起來的危險。敲鑼，宣佛號的聲音也漸漸低弱了。我為他深深地担憂着：他能支持這崎嶇的山路嗎，這樣的深夜跌到山谷裹是不會有人去救的呢。</p>
<p>糢糊的身影和昏黯的燈子又混入夜的朦朧裹去，我呆立着，輕微的惆悵浮上我的心，我忘記夜露是重的，而我有太單薄的衫子。</p>
<p>一聲凄涼的宣佛聲從頂上傳來，接着鑼聲也響了。餘音嫋嫋地邇散開，逐漸沉落在靜寂的深夜裏。</p>
<h3>國粹</h3>
<p>— 唯生</p>
<p>“國粹”的解釋，不用說，應該是“國家精粹”的意思。然而要怎樣的事物才配得上稱是“國家的精粹”呢？那不用說，是那些帮助國家民族得生，因此標記了國家民族底光榮的東西。</p>
<p>但無論什麼國家和民族，需要求生這一點是萬古不變的，而能使它得生和發展的東西却時時在改變着。比方火槍十礮，是曾經帮助過我們的民族獨立生存過來的“國粹”，但是現在，若再死抱住火槍士礮不肯放手，那反要失掉“生”的日子就在眼前。這點淺顯的道理，無論古今，凡是清醒一點的人都懂得的。所以，棄牧畜而耕作，並不算“華夏”的羞恥：廢除跪拜而採用鞠躬，取消帝制而建立共和，也不唯不能採用“國粹”家的邏輯，認為是“崇洋”的投降表現，且是每一個熱血的中國人，都要認為是民光榮的具現，中華民族解放運動中的不朽的標識。可見，只要是眞正能助我們得生的東西，都應該接受過來，且都一樣是民族光榮柱五。這是沒有什麼“外來”或“本位”的對立的。</p>
<p>問題倒不在於“本”“外”，而在於“獲得”。</p>
<p>比方公路吧：人家是用來流通自己底工業生產品的，是拿來調節自己底國內市塲的，我們却是拿來帮助舶來品的傾銷：結果，在人家是用來表現了發展，而在我們，却是用來表現了墮落。可見要眞能使“外來”的東西有益於我們，也須要有眞實的力量。又比方文字吧：古人由象形而篆棣，由篆棣而草楷，是時時在求進步的，而現在我們的國粹一家却反抱住方塊不放：書寫物吧：古人由刀而筆，由簡而紙，也時時是在求着進步的，未嘗因為丟掉舊的，不中用的東西而吝惜，而我們現在的“國粹家們，也反死抱住一文房四寶”不肯丟手：結果，一切在古人是光榮的行為，而在我們，則是無能的鄙陋！可見就要眞的保存一國粹”的精神，也不是苟且偷安的懶虫們所能做得到的。</p>
<p>昨天，報載着這樣一段消息：江蘇省立揚州中學校長周厚樞與其介弟周厚復兩氏，鑒於青年學子使用自來水筆日廣，毛筆書法能力日低，而洋紙消耗日多，爰悉心研究，創製懷中文具，及寫字墨膏，文具為一極精美小賽象牙盒，內裝筆墨硯水，文房四寶，……誠保存國粹挽回權利之利器，……</p>
<p>兩位周先生能看見“洋紙消耗日多”而關心，由這關心而想到“挽回權利”，這用心是值得敬服的。然而，他們“悉心研究”的結果，不是跟“洋紙”一樣好的“國紙”，跟“洋自來水筆”一樣好的一國自來水筆”，而是裝在“精美小賽象牙盒”裹的新式“文房四寶”。既要調墨，又須加水，茹墨揮毫，還是那個老套：既骯髒，又麻煩。自然這結果是一定的：不唯不能“挽回權利”且也無法把“國粹”保存，想妥協於復古，結果是做了復古的無益犧牲。</p>
<p>這也是中了非“國粹”的“國粹家”們底毒的一種現形。</p>

<p>二十五萬年前的古頭顱</p>
<p>本年三月下旬美國費城生物學研究院舉行國際古代人類討論會，閉幕的那一天，南非州特蘭斯瓦爾博物院脊椎古生物跟人類學主任白羅姆博士曾把一個古代動物的頭顱，貢獻於會衆之前。那頭顱去夏在特蘭斯瓦爾西南角斯特克方坦一個石灰洞中覓得，是約二十五萬年的古物，可算得人類的始祖，有猴樣的腦子，牙齒却跟人相同，因為是女性，所以取名一斯特克方坦女童。按一九三四年在距斯特克方坦三百哩同樣的一個洞中，也曾覓得一個古生物，取名“太恩格斯男童”。</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>據博士說：這兩種古生物，很有相同之處，古生物學家曾斷定那男童是人類中一種“眞正失踪的連銷”，也有人說，那不過是一個純種的黑猩猩。據南非達特教授的意見，那男童死的時候，才五歲，近於人的成分，比近於人猩猩或黑猩猩的成分為多，而介於猿猴跟“爪哇人”之間。博士很贊同這說，但他以為這兩種古生物，不是生在同一時代的，那男童生在約七十五萬年前的“下更新期”大約跟“爪哇人同一時代，那女童却生在約二十五萬年前的“中更新期”，或“上更新期”。她不過十八歲，牙齒差不多全像人的，她從人類的祖宗，或一百到二百年前的“上新期”人類所遺傳的一類，密切有關，這是很少疑點的。歐洲古生物學對於那男童所屬的種類，意見雖不一致，但把最新發見的新證物，跟以前所發見的互相印證，那“太恩格斯男童”，的確跟人類的始祖很相近的。又查那女童，當日想是被一隻絕種的刃齒虎咬死的，因為在她發見的洞旁，有一隻刃齒虎的遺體，而那猿人的頭骨上，也留着刃齒痕痕跡。斯特克方坦的人猿洞中，常發見許多殘物，那可證明當日人猿是吃拂拂，兎子，鼴鼠，大蟹，小羚羊，生活的。這些東西，現在都已絕種了。還可證明人猿曾用器具殺小羚羊，跟掘鼴鼠，在殺羚羊的當兒，還成羣而往，在水洞旁裹包圍那些小羚羊哩。</p>
<p>博士又說：他相信一切進化，都在“非物質的大力”—也可說“精神的大力”—支配下發展，自始便以人類出現為目的，等到世界上有了人類，大功吿成，於是進化便吿終止。博士以為進化現在已停止了，縱在距今一千萬年後，世界上也不會出現什麼新的活形體的。進化似曾奮力前展，哺乳動物的各大種類，全在“始新期”四千萬年中創生的，此後除了人類以外，却沒有新種哺乳動物創生。在距今約一百萬年前，忽然產生人形的動物，却像有一羣大力，奉着造化人類的使命，都在努力進化，但是除了成功一種外，其餘的都已失敗而滅亡了。博士又說明他的觀念，雖免要被宗教家反對，但生物學家赫克斯萊氏正在著書發揮這種定見。”</p>
<p>哈佛大學胡頓教授也在會中發表意見道：人類對於他自己的進化也非靠本身，因為人的機構中含著一種力量，那機構自然會實現他自己的命運。前人類的動物是縣在樹上搖擺的，後來漸漸覺得自己的個兒太大，不適於做這種小孩子的把戲，於是便下地覓取機會，因此人類才住在地面上。胡頓博士又說及“化石人”的功續，遠非現代的野巒可比，現代的野蠻，很少值得人類學家注意的成績。人類最初用的器具，跟火的用途，都是化石人”發現的，“化石人”大約還是有規律的言語創始者。他脫離了猿猴，創造人的文化，這麼偉大的功績，後來人的事業，還沒有能勝過他的。</p>

<h3>Ueda Consults with De Wang and Vigorously Trains Bandit Puppet Troops</h3>
<p>Organizes Two Large Detachments into Two Divisions; De Wang Appoints Himself Commander-in-Chief; Japanese Increase Troops on Border by One Brigade</p>
<p>[Beiping] Reports of an additional brigade stationed in Zhangbei and Rehe have been confirmed. After Ueda returned to Changchun, this plan was immediately implemented to increase the strength of the Meng puppet regime. It is reported that the so-called Mongolian Banner Security Force is being actively trained, organized into two large detachments, comprising the strength of two divisions, with Bao Yueqing and Li Shouxin appointed as detachment commanders, and De Wang as commander-in-chief. The training method involves using 100 men as a unit, with two Japanese officers serving as instructors. The required equipment is supplied by the Japanese. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] Li Shouxin's artillery regiment stationed in Zhangbei was completely moved to Huade on the 8th. Regiment commander Ding Chunxuan received a major demerit for losing seven artillery mirrors worth 30,000 yuan. Furthermore, the special service agency ordered Zhangduo Company to lend ten vehicles to transport ammunition to areas within the pass continuously from the 7th. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Ueda has flown from Huade to inspect Zhanghua, Binxian, Guyuan and other places. Part of the Matsui Division is moving from Zhifeng to Duolun, and many camel carts are currently concentrated there. The Japanese claim that this is for the rotation of puppet bandit troops. It is also reported that a certain faction is transferring a large number of puppet bandit troops from Shangdu and Zhangbei to the rear for reorganization, increasing their monthly pay to more than double that of the Sui army, intending to prevent defection. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Sources say that General Ueda Kenkichi flew from Chengde to Jiabus, where he held important consultations with De Wang, Li Shouxin, Bao Yueqing, and others. Ueda flew to Zhangbei on the 7th before returning to Chengde for inspection. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The Japanese army in Rehe decided to increase troops after Ueda arrived in Rehe. Currently, military transport is busy among Duolun, Chicheng, and Longguan. After flying to Duolun, Ueda also inspected Binxian, Guyuan, and other places. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Rumors of troop movements by puppet bandits and certain factions in Chahar East have been circulating for days, creating a tense situation. According to those returning from inspection in Zhangbei, most of the puppet bandit troops in Shangdu and Zhangbei still belong to Liu Guitang. Li Shouxin's puppet troops are located between Binxian and Kangbao. In recent months, due to a lack of fuel, puppet bandit troops have frequently dispatched small units to Honggeertu and other places to collect supplies from the civilian population, and have been repeatedly driven out by the Jin-Sui army, hence the rumor that the Jin-Sui army will launch a counteroffensive. The puppet bandit troops in Zhangbei and Shangdu are currently tense. However, recently, the Liu and Li units of the puppet bandits and newly formed security force cavalry in Shangdu and Zhangbei have been frequently mobilized, but the number of troops has not increased. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Guihua] Men Bingyue came to Sui on the 8th to meet with Fu Zuoyi to request instructions on the defense of Sui East. Wang Zixiu, the newly appointed brigade commander, left Sui on the 8th to return to Sui East to assume his defense post. Yuan Qingzeng, director of the Suiyuan provincial capital police bureau, was approved to resign, and Zhang Gongliang was appointed by the provincial government on the 8th to succeed him. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Han Fuju Inspects Jiaodong</h3>
<p>[Jinan] Han Fuju left for Jiaodong by car at 7:00 AM on the 8th for inspection. He will first inspect Zhangqiu and then proceed to various counties, planning to return to Ji'nan after a week. Military and political affairs will be handled on his behalf by Liu Shuxiang, Zhang Shaotang, and Li Shuchun. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Today, Han Fuju inspected Zhangqiu, and he is scheduled to go to Zouping on the 9th. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Mr. Stefani and Jiang Baili and others visited the Zouping Rural Construction Institute today and will go to Qingdao tonight. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>He Yaozu Visits Liu Zhi</h3>
<p>Gansu's Financial Difficulties Are Being Addressed; He Is Scheduled to Take Office in Gansu in Mid-Month</p>
<p>[Nanjing] He Yaozu, acting chairman of Gansu, visited Yu Xuezhong on the morning of the 8th to discuss Gansu's administration. He also met with Liu Zhi in the afternoon for discussions. It is reported that Gansu Province is facing financial difficulties due to the stagnation of taxation, and has requested the Ministry of Finance to find a solution. A loan of 200,000 yuan from the Central Bank has been approved and will be remitted to Gansu for use. He is scheduled to take office in Gansu in mid-month. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] He Yaozu visited Yu Xuezhong on the morning of the 8th to discuss the handover of provincial government affairs. He is scheduled to take a train to Shaanxi on the 10th to meet with Gu Zhutong, and is expected to fly to Lanzhou to take office around the 15th. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Tan Kemin, secretary-general of the Qinghai Provincial Government, followed Ma Lin by train westward.

<h3>Truth About the Floating Corpse Case in Tianjin's Hai River</h3>
<p>Police Bureau Arrests Two Corpse-Carrying Coolies; They Were Coming from a Certain Concession and Planned to Carry the Corpse to the Riverbank</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The source of the floating corpse in Tianjin's Hai River has now been identified. Since this case aroused significant attention from all parties, the Police Bureau immediately ordered its subordinates to thoroughly investigate the truth. Song Zheyuan also personally instructed that those who solve the case will be heavily rewarded. At 3:30 PM on the 8th, detectives from the Police Bureau discovered four coolies along the south bank of the Huashi River by the East Floating Bridge, carrying a corpse. They were coming from a certain concession. Two people were arrested while leading the team, and the others fled. According to the arrested coolies, one named Yang Xiang and the other Kong Zhaoyuan, they made a living by pulling wooden carts (wheelbarrows for transporting heavy objects). Today, while passing through Zhakou Street, they were ordered by a patrolman to carry a corpse from the roadside to the riverbank. They said that they had never done the same thing before. Around 4:00 PM in the afternoon, detectives discovered the same incident at the same location. However, the corpse-carrying coolies fled to a certain concession as soon as they saw that things were not going well, and could not be captured. At that time, the person being carried had not yet died. It is said that his name was Jia Rongqi, 30 years old, from Cang County. He used to make playing cards for a living. He came to Tianjin several months ago to make a living, staying at a certain noodle restaurant in Zhakou Street. Now, because of serious illness, he was carried here by someone hired by the restaurant. It is generally speculated that Yang Xiang and others were told to carry the corpse to the riverbank, which was the end of the mission. It was to avoid the serious crime of throwing people into the river. Since Yin and others are coolies with difficult livelihoods, they would inevitably strip off the clothes when throwing the corpse to make a living. There is no doubt about this. The Police Bureau is now stepping up its investigation, and more concrete findings should be available soon. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Li Pingheng of the International Labour Bureau Delivered a Speech at the Governing Body Meeting</h3>
<p>Explaining Our Concession Factory Inspection Issues</p>
<p>[Geneva] At the 79th session of the Governing Body of the International Labour Bureau, Li Pingheng, the representative of the Chinese government, delivered a speech to explain the factory inspection issues in Chinese concessions, and detailed the historical background of various laws passed from the 1919 Washington International Labour Conference to 1936. Li went on to say that although the Chinese government has various economic and financial difficulties, it still implements several factory inspection laws. If the Chinese Factory Law is not implemented in the Shanghai concession, then China cannot fully implement labor legislation. Chinese industry must be subject to the control of the Factory Inspection Law, and it is naturally reasonable that it cannot compete with industrial sectors in concessions that are not subject to inspection. The ratification of international labor agreements will be equally difficult. The non-implementation of the Factory Inspection Law in the concessions hinders the development of Chinese industry and prevents the improvement of workers' conditions. Li immediately suggested to the Governing Body that it order the Director of the Labour Bureau to intervene quickly and contact the relevant powers on this serious issue. The Governing Body unanimously adopted Li's proposal. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>On the National Defense Line (4)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shu Di</p>
<p>㊂ Impressions of Shanxi and Inner Mongolia</p>
<p>"What are your impressions?" — As soon as I arrived in Taiyuan, a particularly impatient friend asked me this question. During my stay there, I was repeatedly asked the same question by people from all walks of life. When I was about to leave, a friend came to see me off at the station —</p>
<p>"What are your impressions of this trip?" This question was asked for the last time.</p>
<p>As a news reporter, how should I answer this question? I really wanted to say vaguely, "Very good, very good!" or: "Everything looks pretty good." However, when they asked the question, they often added: "Don't just listen to polite compliments: we want to hear your specific impressions as a guest from afar. What are they?"</p>
<p>Seeing their earnest, enthusiastic, sincere, and humble expressions, I felt that I should not just give a perfunctory answer: I should calmly summarize the impressions I had gained from all aspects and then answer them. Whether what I said was right or wrong was another question; as far as I was concerned, I wanted to live up to their intentions and live up to my mission on this national defense line trip.</p>
<p>Therefore, I kept my answer for later. I said: "Let's talk about it after I have summarized and analyzed what I have learned."</p>
<p>But now, it is time to tell both the people of Shanxi and the readers of this newspaper what my impressions of Shanxi are.</p>
<p>I would like to start with this point. The biggest reason I was sent by this newspaper to travel along the national defense line this time, I have already outlined in the "Issuing the Title" above. The biggest reason for my visit to Shanxi is because it is located on the national defense line and bears the task of the national defense vanguard. The various situations are of particular concern to people from all walks of life across the country. My personal hope for Shanxi is the same as that of the people of the whole country: to hope that it will become the most solid vanguard of our nation in all aspects. Therefore, the objects I want to see in Shanxi are the same as those in other areas located on the national defense line. If the impressions I get in Shanxi are somewhat different from those in other places, it should be because of the different ways they are presented, not because of the difference in my views.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly said the above paragraph to all parties in Shanxi. They immediately understood me and asked enthusiastically: "Well, what do you plan to see?"</p>
<p>I thought for a moment and said: "I want to see everything comprehensively, but if I have to divide it, there are probably these items: national defense facilities, economic construction, mass organizations..."</p>
<p>Therefore, they gave me a lot of convenience and help very enthusiastically, sometimes even exceeding the scope of what I expected. In this way, I completed a general observation of all aspects. When I left, they showed a very trusting expression and said to me: "Although you are a news reporter and have the mission of reporting everything you hear, we believe that you will be able to truthfully communicate your observations and feelings to the people of the country in an appropriate manner." They did not say: "This is a national defense secret, so there is no need to publish it," or about something else, "Please do not disclose it," etc. However, these words are often encountered by news reporters.</p>
<p>I can only thank them for their enthusiasm and trust, and be ashamed of my own weak abilities: but I always want to report what I have observed in Shanxi and my personal feelings to the best of my ability in an "appropriate way." Their attitude deeply moved me, and I dare say that, from the standpoint of the nation, the views of our 490 million compatriots are completely consistent.</p>
<p>After carefully summarizing and analyzing it in my mind, if you want me to say my overall impression of Shanxi, then the deepest impression I have is: all the people in Shanxi, from Mr. Yan Baichuan, Mr. Zhao Cilong, senior generals, and responsible people in all aspects, "to the entire people of the province, everyone understands the importance of their position on the national defense line and are working hard there; at the same time, they urgently hope and work with compatriots across the country, unite, and move towards the great road of defending the country and protecting the race. Therefore, they very much want the compatriots across the country to understand them more and help them more; therefore, they are also very willing to show the true situation of Shanxi to the news reporters, hoping that it will be truthfully transmitted to the people of the country through their "appropriate reports." Like some places that regard news reporters as troublesome figures and carry out absolute news censorship, there is none in Shanxi. Even if my personal treatment in Shanxi this time does not represent the entire journalistic community, I would like to cite a few trivial things here as an example.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Taiyuan, it was when Mr. Yan Baichuan was the busiest; the southward transfer of the troops who had revolted in Jin Xianzhang, the examination of the county magistrates of the whole province, the grand review of the youth, the examination of the backbone personnel of the national army; all senior generals gathered and were holding a provincial defense conference; ... all of this was personally presided over by Mr. Yan. (In fact, everything in Shanxi is personally presided over by Mr. Yan, and I think he has always been busy. But according to friends, those two days were when he was particularly busy.) After knowing this situation, when a friend asked me if I wanted to see Mr. Yan, I felt a little hesitant.</p>
<p>"Since I've come to Shanxi, of course I want to see Mr. Yan to pay my respects. But, didn't you say he's particularly busy now?... I think I'll wait for a chance to talk about it, because I'm afraid I won't be staying for too long."</p>
<p>That day, I went with Mr. Liu from the Liaison Office of the Pacification Commissioner's Office to visit the various factories of the Northwest Industrial Company. On the way, I chatted with him about Mr. Yan's recent busyness.</p>
<p>"Isn't that right!" he said. "The guests to be met in the past week have already been scheduled."</p>
<p>Therefore, I calculated in my heart that the matter of seeing Mr. Yan was probably hopeless this time: judging from the situation, I would have to wait at least ten days, and I only planned to stay in Shanxi for at most another week.</p>
<p>However, the next day, a friend suddenly ran to me and said: "I have already spoken to Mr. Yan, and he said that he met you in Suiyuan. Hearing that you have come here, he said that he plans to see you and talk to you."</p>

<h3>Democracy and Separatism</h3>
<p>— Tao Xisheng</p>
<p>Foreign party activities are class-based. Chinese party activities are clearly local. In foreign countries, domestic political power is unified, and parties that are not tolerated by the government can only engage in secret activities among the people, or even flee abroad. In China, politics is not yet fully unified, and parties that are not tolerated in Province A can move to Province B. Even parties that are not tolerated by the central government can operate openly in the localities. To put it bluntly, today, the central government's strict control is causing some parties to attach themselves to the localities in order to survive. For the sake of survival, they often fear unification.</p>
<p>Under today's international situation, it is not very justifiable to directly oppose the unification of the country. People who oppose unification often use democratic politics as the theoretical basis. Democratic politics and local separatism can be said to have a confusing appearance. Advocates of democratic politics often oppose centralism, but in reality, they are protecting local separatism. To be objective, this is not a logical theory. If Provinces A, B, and C do not have democratic systems, then a country composed of Provinces A, B, and C is not a democratic country. Conversely, if the central government has great power, and this centralized central government regards the people as the sovereign and only listens to their orders, then this country cannot be said to be undemocratic.</p>
<p>Even so, parties that are not tolerated by the government do not see it that way, especially those who speak and lecture: speakers and lecturers are most suitable for local separatism. Those who are not tolerated in Qi can go to Qin, and those who are not tolerated in Chu can live in Wei. If democratic politics is equivalent to freedom of speech, regardless of whether Qin, Qi, Chu, and Wei each practice democratic systems, as long as the four countries are mutually contradictory, then the federation of the four countries is a democratic country. Why? Speakers and lecturers can speak freely in the four countries, what is more democratic than that? They can oppose Qin in Qi and oppose Chu in Wei, what is more democratic than that? If Qin, Qi, Chu, and Wei become a unified country, then the speeches and lectures of wandering scholars will of course be restricted. Even in a democratic country, there are still criminal laws for internal strife, and there is no freedom like in the era of separatism.</p>
<p>Party strife and local separatism often exist together, this is a very obvious fact. I believe that in China today, if the process of unification and the process of democratization become parallel processes, the intensity of the demands of the various parties for local separatism can be reduced. I often say that you cannot have centralism without democracy, and this is one reason. Specifically, rather than letting the so-called various parties separately promote local centrifugal force, it is better to allow them to speak and lecture freely under the conference system of the central government. Even if speakers and lecturers can each gain one or two thousand followers, they will not have the same mysterious power as they do under control. Rather than letting curious young people have the interest of "reading forbidden books behind closed doors," it is better to let them see each party leader clearly in broad daylight, and turn mystery into ordinariness.</p>
<p>The most obvious recent events can be used as proof. Within the past year, speakers and lecturers brought out the phrase "unification of the various parties," and surprisingly, many people responded. Since the publication of the "Thoroughly Eliminate the Communist Party" case of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, where has the so-called movement of the various parties gone? Similarly, for control, they advocate freedom of speech. If speech is truly free, what supernatural or superhuman speech is there? What appeal do a few slogans plus a few labels have?</p>
<p>In a newspaper in Beiping, I put forward the request for "opening the net on three sides," asking the central government to announce a policy to those so-called various parties saying: "Those who want to go left, go left; those who want to go right, go right; those who do not obey will enter my net." This can reduce one cause of local separatism and can gather China's strength to great effect.</p>
<h3>British-Japanese Talks Will Not Harm China's Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Nor is it intended to divide spheres of influence, but only to discuss certain current matters</p>
<p>[London] The issue of cooperation between Britain and Japan in the Far East will likely begin negotiations in a very short period of time. According to official announcements, the British government is currently awaiting proposals from Japan. Japanese sources say that the Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Shigeru Yoshida, has already received instructions from the government, but must wait until several points in it are fully clarified before submitting it to the British government. The general public strongly claims that the British-Japanese talks will not harm the interests of other countries or China's territorial and political integrity. The British side has no intention of recognizing "Manchukuo" and does not intend to change its current Far East policy. Britain and Japan will only conduct concrete discussions on certain matters that have been determined before, such as the issue of financially assisting China, the issue of Chinese railways, and the issue of customs. Japanese sources also said that Japan will still firmly maintain its original views on the following two issues: ㊀ That no country should interfere in the various political issues that are only related to China and Japan, and the issue of dividing spheres of influence in China between Britain and Japan will not be allowed to be discussed. ㊁ That Japan will continue to reject any qualitative restrictions on the naval side if its previous demand for quantitative restrictions is not met. According to those responsible, the British-Japanese cooperation negotiations have already caused unease on the Chinese side. The Chinese government is said to have inquired of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, about the meaning of these talks. It is also said that the British government replied that Britain and Japan are currently only conducting preliminary talks to exchange views. Afterwards, the British-Japanese talks will not harm China's interests and there is no intention of dividing spheres of influence in China. In addition, Japanese Ambassador to the UK Shigeru Yoshida has repeatedly visited the British Foreign Office recently. So far, the only result is to clarify the general atmosphere between the two countries. Before the League of Nations meeting, Japan was condemned for the dispute between China and Japan. Last year, an incident occurred in Keelung, Taiwan, where British sailors were insulted. Since then, relations between Britain and Japan have been tense. Today, the contact between the Japanese ambassador and the Foreign Office is only enough to eliminate this tense state. As for the real negotiations, they will usually begin after Japan submits a proposal. (Central News Agency, Havana dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>[London] Major General Wuttruff, manager of the Henan Fu Company in China, hosted a banquet for Chinese Special Envoy Dr. H. H. Kung tonight. Financial figures also said that the company issued a notice today announcing that it will undertake financial reforms. The issues discussed during the banquet were about this. According to the content of the notice, the company's business reorganization in China has been completed. Thanks to the sincere cooperation of the Chinese authorities, the results of the mining operations are very satisfactory. Under the current circumstances, the general situation in China, especially in the vicinity of the company's mining sites in Henan Province, has gradually stabilized. The company's directors believe that now is the time to reduce the company's capital. If no international disputes occur in the Far East, and the Chinese government can maintain the status quo, then dividends can be distributed in the near future after the company's capital is reduced.

<h3>Japanese Socialist Party Criticizes Successive Cabinets</h3>
<p>The ruling class implements deceptive policies, making prices expensive and the people miserable</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Socialist People's Party, which made significant progress in the current general election, held its first new delegate meeting at 1:00 PM today on the third floor of the Marunouchi Imperial Agricultural Association Building. Thirty-seven new members and all members of the Central Executive Committee attended. Suzuki Bunji was elected as Chairman of the Delegate Meeting, Sugiyama Genjiro as Vice Chairman, and Asanuma, Kawakami, Kamei, and Mizutani as secretaries. Subsequently, Chairman Abe and Secretary-General Aso delivered opening speeches, encouraging party members to fight for the people, resolutely carry out internal reforms, and then decided to hold a daily delegate meeting once a day to discuss policies to deal with the current situation, and their implementation attitudes. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. Chairman Abe's speech is as follows: Our party has made epoch-making progress in this general election. This is the result of our twenty years of arduous struggle in the social movement of our country, and it is also the public opinion of the masses demanding the implementation of internal reforms. We are not overconfident in victory, and we must feel deeply the importance of our party's mission. This general election not only failed to provide any solution to the volatile political situation, but also made the chaotic situation more profound. As a result, prices are expensive and the lives of the people are under extreme pressure. Now, the self-defense struggle demanding increased wages has become a national movement. Such heavy pressure on the lives of the people is a necessary consequence of the cooperative regime of the ruling class, such as the Hirota Cabinet and the Chai Cabinet, which forcibly creates huge budgets based on narrow national defense under the current structure. We will resolutely fight against the deceptive policies of the ruling class and criticize the responsibility of the Lin Cabinet. The Lin Cabinet, in view of the public opinion of the people and its own responsibility, should quickly resign to transform the political situation. There is no way to open up this chaotic situation other than to implement internal reforms. We believe that the urgent handling of the authorities should remove the pressure of life due to expensive prices, and quickly increase the salaries and wages of lower-level officials and workers. As for the next regime, we should immediately convene a special parliament to decide on specific plans for national reform. (Daimeng News Agency dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Plans to Limit Imports</h3>
<p>To cope with rising prices</p>
<p>[Tokyo] In order to improve the international balance of payments and cope with rising prices, the Ministry of Finance intends to further implement trade management from the import exchange permission system. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry also takes the same steps as the Ministry of Finance and decides to review the issue of limiting the quantity of important imports, which is the basis of the import exchange permission system, and has been holding meetings to discuss this matter for days. According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry's policy, it will investigate the various situations of import and export of national defense-related products and raw materials, and domestic consumer goods imported from abroad, in order to establish a reasonable import restriction policy for reference. As a result, the import of so-called unnecessary goods, in addition to national defense supplies, export product raw materials, etc., will be greatly restricted.

<h3>Davis Leaves England for America</h3>
<p>London Talks Come to an End</p>
<p>[London] American envoy Davis, having stayed in London for 39 days, took advantage of the departure of the Manhattan today to give a statement to a reporter from the Daily Mail, describing his impressions of the European situation after meeting with diplomats and economic leaders from various countries. He said that international trade routes must be opened up to allow economic forces to develop freely, so that the whole world can achieve a stable state. Disarmament must be implemented, but only after economic stability. Regarding an Anglo-American agreement, he said that there was little hope for the signing of such an agreement, as there were already too many agreements signed worldwide. However, the United States is prepared to suggest increasing commercial relations between the two countries. He believes that the result of the International Sugar Conference is the first step towards economic stability. (National Maritime Telegraph, 8th)</p>
<h3>London Exceptionally Lively in Preparation for Watching the Coronation Parade</h3>
<p>Viewing Stands Everywhere Can Accommodate One Million People, 200,000 of Whom Are From Abroad</p>
<p>[London] Today, 30,000 troops participating in the British King's coronation arrived here by train from various places. The lively scene at the London station was unprecedented since the war. Overseas spectators are also arriving in England in large numbers. In the next three days, 16 ships will arrive from Canada, the United States, the Far East, the West Indies, Africa, and New Zealand, carrying passengers. Thousands more are coming from continental Europe. It is estimated that the viewing stands along the parade route will accommodate one million people, of whom no fewer than 200,000 will be from overseas. Tourists arriving early can avoid the congestion at the last minute and leisurely visit scenic spots throughout the country, as well as tour the latest industrial and national defense arrangements. London streets are decorated with lights and flags, and high viewing stands, some as high as 60 feet, are erected on both sides of the streets along the coronation parade route, supported by iron pillars to prevent collapse. The most worrying thing is the public bus strike, but efforts are being made to get the strikers back to work as soon as possible. The 25,000 strikers are also well aware of the impact of the bus strike on hundreds of thousands of tourists. Bevin, the general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, and other union leaders were at the union this morning awaiting a summons from the Ministry of Labor. It is widely believed that the Labor Bureau will be able to mediate the bus drivers' demand for a 7.5-hour workday. If mediation fails, the government may take action. The bus drivers still consider the proposal of the Court of Inquiry to be insufficiently thorough, and they want a firm guarantee that experts will investigate all the facts of their complaints.

<p>[Washington] Navy Secretary Swanson said today that the Navy Department will continue to study the effectiveness of airships, which are lighter than air, and whether the huge cost is worthwhile. Until last month, the construction of these airships seemed very unprofitable, but if the treasury has surplus funds, the Navy intends to build one for experimental purposes. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>[Washington] U.S. Navy Secretary Swanson recently announced that the Navy Department will continue to study the applicability of airships and will not change its policy due to the Hindenburg tragedy. The fire on the ship was caused by hydrogen, but American airships use helium instead of hydrogen, so there is no risk of fire. (Central News Agency, Havas, 7th)</p>

<h3>US to Abolish Helium Export Ban</h3>
<p>Cause of Hindenburg Accident Under Investigation, Death Toll Now Reaches Thirty-Six</p>
<p>[New York] After the destruction of the German airship Hindenburg, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, in a state of shock and mourning, passed a bill to lift the current ban on the export and commercial sale of helium, which the United States has a monopoly on. Helium can be exported for non-military purposes under regulations approved by the president. American private individuals or domestic commercial organizations who wish to purchase and store helium may also be approved. However, the government may purchase helium when it is necessary for national defense. After the passage of this bill, there will be no problem with the sale of helium. However, members of the Armed Services Committee still have doubts about whether the United States can supply Germany with a sufficient amount of helium for its airships. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The whole of Germany expressed grief over the Hindenburg airship accident. Prime Minister Hitler has ordered the allocation of 30,000 marks to comfort the families of the deceased. At the same time, German aviation experts met at the Ministry of Aviation this afternoon to discuss the aftermath and investigation. Those present included members of the investigation team, Dr. Eckener, Dr. Durr, Professor Bork, Professor Dickmann, Colonel Blippert, and Hoffman. They decided to rush to the scene of the accident on the Europa airship on the morning of the 8th to investigate. (National Maritime Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>⊙Cologne, Germany: The chairman of the Zeppelin Airship Company, Dr. Eckener, accompanied by six key figures in the aviation industry, boarded a plane from here to Cherbourg, France, at 1:25 pm, and then transferred to the German mail ship Bremen to go to the United States to investigate the truth of the Hindenburg airship accident. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of Commerce Roper has appointed several members to organize a committee to conduct an investigation. Senator Copeland, chairman of the Senate Aviation Safety Committee, announced that the committee will investigate two matters: ㊀ whether the Hindenburg accident was due to deliberate sabotage, and ㊁ what materials were used in the internal construction of the airship, and whether these materials were non-combustible. It is also heard that Congress will pass a law stipulating that fire-resistant materials must be used in buildings. (Central News Agency, Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the cause of the German airship Hindenburg accident, Dr. Eckener, chairman of the Zeppelin Airship Company, gave a radio address here, saying that the U.S. government has always had excellent equipment and personnel for aviation authorities, so the claim that the accident was caused by deliberate sabotage is not credible. However, it is more reasonable to say that an electrical phenomenon occurred due to weather reasons, causing an explosion. (Central News Agency, Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>[New York] Another injured passenger from the German airship Hindenburg accident died today, bringing the death toll to as many as thirty-six. (Central News Agency, Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3>Hindenburg Insurance Premium Was Very High</h3>
<p>Totaling £500,000</p>
<p>[London] The Hindenburg German airship had disaster insurance totaling £500,000, of which £225,000 was underwritten by the British Lloyd's insurance company. The company knew that the ship used hydrogen and was at risk of fire, but still underwrote it. In addition, all crew members and passengers also had huge amounts of life insurance. As such, the amount to be compensated this time is extremely large, which is rare in the aviation industry. (Central News Agency, Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to the Zeppelin Airline, the insurance amount for the Hindenburg airship in German insurance companies reached 6 million marks. Due to repeated reinsurance, this total has reached 2.5 million gold yuan. The company has now decided to pay 30,000 marks to comfort each deceased passenger. (National Maritime Telegraph, 7th)</p>

She only climbed out after the airship landed, so she suffered only minor injuries. After being bandaged by a hospital doctor, she walked away alone and went to the airport to take a plane to Boston. Mrs. Clement said that there were five women and one young girl among the passengers on the ill-fated airship, but they were not seen after the accident. However, she maintained her calm attitude throughout. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>Britain Asks Both Sides in Spain to Stop Aerial Bombardment</h3>
<p>Proposed in the Non-Intervention Committee, Representatives of Various Countries Request Instructions from Their Home Countries</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War held a meeting this afternoon and issued a communiqué after the meeting stating that the British representative had proposed that both sides in the Spanish civil war stop aerial bombardment. The other representatives agreed to ask their governments for instructions. The subcommittee will send the original text of the British proposal to the representatives of various countries so that they can quickly report to their respective governments and receive instructions in the shortest possible time.

<p>[London] The House of Commons debated the Spanish issue today. Foreign Secretary Eden stated that the British government is determined to do its best to promote the policy of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war to prevent causing European disputes.

This matter is progressing on a large scale and may create a new situation that requires us to reconsider. However, I do not believe that this situation will necessarily arise.

<p>[London] The diplomatic correspondent of the News Chronicle recently declared that the fact that German planes had flown to Spanish-controlled Balearic Islands via Italy and Spain has now been proven to be true. Between March 18 and April 6, German planes delivered 5,000 bombs, giant bombs (each weighing 250 kilograms), and 5,000 incendiary bombs to the Spanish Nationalists. As such, Foreign Secretary Eden's statement in the House of Commons on Thursday that Germany and Italy supplied the Nationalists with aircraft is not entirely consistent with the non-intervention agreement. It is not known what technical reasons there are to justify this. Responsible persons here are generally unclear about the reason. (Central News Agency, Havas, 8th)</p>

As the army moved forward, enemy planes bombed the government army positions in the mountains with bombs, dropping as many as 100 incendiary bombs, causing a pine forest fire. However, the Basque army's resistance was not weakened. Moroccan troops attacked the right wing of the Basque army, but it was difficult to make progress due to the dense forest on the hillside. The Basque army could use the forest to cover themselves and shoot at the enemy. The landing of Moroccan troops in the Basque Country is the first time in Spanish history.

<h3>French Prime Minister Calls on Labor and Management to Avoid Disputes</h3>
<p>Both Sides Should Consider Rights and Obligations, Important Social Laws Will Be Proposed Soon</p>
<p>[Paris] Prime Minister Blum spoke in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon on the government's current socio-economic policies and appealed to labor and management nationwide to consider their responsibilities to the country. He said that this appeal did not come from him alone, nor from the government alone, but from the entire country. He also reviewed the government's past achievements, saying that in the current situation, economic recovery is a remarkable phenomenon. Therefore, in order to make the various reforms that have already been implemented adapt to the new environment and prepare for future reforms, there is a legitimate reason to temporarily suspend the implementation of other reforms. It should be stated that the government does not intend to implement any other reforms other than those stipulated in the People's Front platform. The Prime Minister then declared that the government intends to propose several important social bills soon, the most important of which are as follows: ① the Agricultural Debt Amendment Bill, ② the Old-Age Workers' Endowment Fund Bill, ③ the Public Servants' Right to Join Unions Bill, and ④ the Prevention of Agricultural Disasters Bill. In order to avoid excessive expenditure, the government cannot approve the request of the General Confederation of Labor to allocate 100 million francs to carry out public works. However, the government will still spend as much as 800 million francs on public works this year. As for fiscal revenue, the government will adopt fairer collection methods and eliminate tax evasion. In this way, fiscal revenue can be expected to increase, and it will be easier to raise funds for the implementation of the old-age endowment fund system. To this end, the Prime Minister asked labor and management to do their best to avoid disputes so that the Paris International Exposition can proceed smoothly and achieve success. He also said that since the General Confederation of Labor and the National Employers' Federation signed a work contract last July, labor interests have been protected. However, since the labor class has obtained new rights, it must also assume new obligations. As for the employers, they should know that their rights are not arbitrary or inherent, but should be restricted by law. Labor laws, such as the Compulsory Arbitration Law for Labor-Management Disputes, must be implemented by the employers. The Prime Minister finally said that the spirit of progress must be supplemented by the spirit of order and reason, and loyalty to the people's livelihood system and peaceful procedures must be complemented by decisiveness and determination. The success or failure of French democracy must be proven in this. After the Prime Minister's speech, all the deputies of the People's Front parties stood up and applauded warmly. Therefore, observers believe that when the Chamber of Deputies ends the debate tomorrow and votes on the motion of confidence in the government, the government will be able to obtain a majority of confidence.

<h3>A Brief History of the Invention of Zeppelin Airships</h3>
<p>The German Zeppelin airship "Hindenburg" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, USA. The following is a brief history of the invention of airships:</p>
<p>The inventor of airships was not a German, but a Jew discriminated against by Germans at the time, named David Schwarz. Schwarz was originally a timber merchant from Agram, a place that used to belong to Austria but now belongs to Yugoslavia. He was actually the first in the world to manufacture an airship with a cabin. His first difficulty was the question of what material to use for the gasbag on top of the airship. He initially used metal for its sturdiness. However, in order to ascend, it needed to be lightweight, so it had to be a light metal. Finally, he decided to use aluminum, but no one believed him. Later, with the help of a Russian military attaché, he was able to go to Russia, which usually refused Jews entry, for testing. After two years, the aluminum gasbag was made. Another difficulty arose: the gas filled into the gasbag was deemed unsuitable. When the deadline arrived, the airship still could not fly, leading to conflict with the Russian military. The military stopped funding, so he fled St. Petersburg and went to Westphalia, Germany. A man named Bage lived there and mined aluminum. He thought of using aluminum to make airship gasbags to increase aluminum sales, so Schwarz stayed there to conduct research. However, he was in dire financial straits. Later, the Prussian military and political department took notice of his work, and in 1895, he continued his research in Berlin. However, the motor he made was unsuitable, and the chemical plant did not supply oxygen on time, so he left Berlin for a sanatorium in Jena. On January 13, 1897, the German chemical plant reported that the oxygen was ready. The Prussian military and political department also telegraphed urging him to test the airship and promised to purchase the rights to his invention after a successful test. Unfortunately, he was too excited after receiving the telegram and died of heart failure. At that time, the airship was ready, but no one dared to risk flying it. The authorities found someone, and on November 30, 1897, the test flight was successful. On February 10, 1898, Schwarz's invention rights were sold by his wife to the Zeppelin factory for the low price of 15,000 marks.</p>

<h3>Further News on the Severe Drought in Western Henan</h3>
<p>Eight Million Disaster Victims Eagerly Awaiting Relief - Over Three Hundred Starved to Death in Half a Month</p>
<p>Luoyang Dispatch: Since June of last year, Western Henan has been ravaged by drought, and the disaster has worsened daily. Until now, it has still not rained. Not only was there no harvest last year, but this spring's wheat could not be sown, so there is no hope for a summer harvest. Eight million people in Western Henan are suffering from an unprecedented catastrophe. In the past half month, although there have been occasional light rains, they have only been a few drops. The seeds for autumn crops cannot be planted in the soil, and all cotton fields are also difficult to sow, leading to a worsening drought in over twenty counties in Western Henan. Although benevolent people and gentry have repeatedly gone to the area to provide relief, it is like a drop in the bucket, and few benefit. Therefore, in recent days, there have been daily reports of people dying of starvation in various counties. It is reported that in Dengfeng, Yichuan, Songxian, Yiyang, Gongxian, Luoyang, and other counties, over two hundred people have died of starvation in just ten days. Moreover, at this time when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest is not yet in, almost every household is empty. Even if they wait until June, there will be no wheat to eat. The future is bleak, and the dangers are severe. It is hoped that charitable people will generously donate to quickly provide relief to this major disaster. For a more fundamental solution, such as promoting water conservancy projects and digging wells, it is also hoped that the authorities will actively promote them to prevent future hidden dangers. The following is a brief record of the current disaster situation, which is not only unheard of in Sichuan, Guizhou, and other places, but also an unprecedented catastrophe in Western Henan in decades. It should be known to those who are concerned about the disaster.</p>
<p>Sixteen Thousand Starving People in Dengfeng: The total population of Dengfeng County is 240,000, of which 100,000 are completely starving and cannot survive without relief, and 60,000 are partially starving. Currently, the county has completed the actual registration of the list of starving people and submitted it to the province for relief. The relief supplies received so far, including those from the provincial government, Xiaolu Society, National Relief Association, Mu Ouchu, Gonglu Garrison Department, and the Provincial Relief Association, or from organizations or individuals, total about 150,000 yuan, and 8,000 shi of grain accumulated in the county in the years 23 and 24 are also loaned out to households. However, there are still people starving to death on the roads every day. In the past two weeks, it is estimated that over 110 people have died from starvation. The situation is extremely tragic.</p>
<p>Severe Disaster in Yiyang, Many Starving to Death: Yiyang has a mountainous terrain, and all the land is dry farmland. Therefore, the drought is extremely severe. According to the county magistrate, since the beginning of spring, 78 disaster victims have starved to death in the county. Recently, another 17 people have died of starvation. Currently, in the midst of the spring famine, nine out of ten households are empty. Generally, residents grind stone powder into flour to fill their stomachs. It has been found that this stone powder has no nutritional elements, and prolonged consumption will damage the stomach. The poor people are suffering even more. How tragic!</p>
<p>Starving Corpses Everywhere in Yichuan: According to those providing relief from the Kao Hui Society, the inhuman lives lived by the disaster victims in the county are beyond our imagination. In the Baiyangzhen area, grass roots and tree bark have long been stripped and eaten clean. Many people twist and eat the rice straw from the roofs of their houses, so many houses in the villages no longer have roofs. Recently, many people have been eating stone powder to survive. Many disaster victims in the area have fled to other places to escape the famine, and the number of deaths in recent days is also very high. Initially, some people buried the dead, but recently, because there are too many deaths, no one cares about them. Unexpectedly, starving corpses are seen everywhere. Today, we have actually witnessed it. Even domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, and dogs have long disappeared from the area.</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Beggars and Starving People in Songxian: Songxian has a vast territory and poor soil. Last year, the drought was severe, and both the wheat and autumn harvests were withered. This spring, it was again devastated by banditry, making people's lives even more difficult. All available thistle, hoewort, grass roots, tree bark, and wheat stalks have been scavenged. According to investigations, over 120 beggars have starved to death in the county in recent days. The number is truly alarming. Also, in Yaogou, a village in the county, a child named Lang was carrying over ten black buns when a strong man snatched them away and killed the child with a stone to prevent future trouble. The tragedy of the disaster is truly chilling.</p>
<h3>Plague Rampant in Southern Fujian, Death Toll Reaches 800 in Hui'an</h3>
<p>Health Department Commissioners Draft Epidemic Prevention Plan - Plague Also Discovered in Zhangpu and Zhao'an Counties</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Plague has broken out in the coastal counties of Southern Fujian for two or three months, spreading more rapidly. According to a report from Hui'an on the 2nd, several people have recently died in the city as well. Statistics show that 580 people have died in northern Hui'an, nearly 200 in southern Hui'an, and over 30 in Wangchuan. The total death toll in the county is no less than 800. Lu Dihuan, the section chief of the Provincial Health Department, and Cao Shouli, the head of the Epidemic Prevention Section, are leading disinfection teams to actively carry out prevention and control measures. In Quanzhou, plague was discovered on March 10, and only six people died before it was stopped. On April 19, the plague broke out again. As of May 3, another 15 people have died, bringing the total death toll to 21. Five people have recovered, and five are still ill.</p>
<p>The Health Department dispatched Yang Yongnian, the director of the Health Testing Institute, as a special commissioner for epidemic prevention, leading over 20 epidemic prevention personnel and 60 boxes of medicine to Fujian in batches. Yang arrived in Fuzhou on April 27 and contacted the provincial government. On the 29th, he went south to inspect the epidemic areas, first to Fuqing, then to Putian, and arrived in Hui'an that evening. On May 1, he went to Quanzhou, and on the evening of the 3rd, he arrived in Xiamen. According to him, "The results of the inspection of the epidemic areas show that Fuqing is the most serious, with 300 to 400 deaths. Hui'an is the next most serious, with over 200 deaths. Jinjiang (i.e., Quanzhou) has only a small outbreak, with dozens of deaths. From my observation, the plague in Quanzhou is likely to worsen. Xiamen has implemented effective prevention and control measures, so it is unlikely to break out. Currently, there are eight counties in the epidemic area, including Fuqing, Putian, Xianyou, Hui'an, and Jinjiang. The territory is vast, and the most important task is to conduct a detailed statistical survey of the size of the epidemic area, the houses, and the population. Then, assign personnel to work and set up epidemic prevention stations or sub-stations in different areas. After staying in Xiamen for a few days, I will return to Fuzhou to draft an overall plan and send personnel to each of the affected counties to recruit 20 students above the middle school level to implement training in hygiene and epidemic prevention to assist in the work. After two weeks, I will set out again to inspect the epidemic prevention work, which is scheduled to last for six months starting from May 1. The fundamental solution is to renovate the houses to eliminate the rats, but due to economic and time constraints, we can only administer injections and disinfectations for the time being. The funds required are 10,000 yuan from the central government and 20,000 yuan from the Fujian provincial government, but I am afraid that it will still be insufficient." Cao Shouli, the head of the Provincial Epidemic Prevention Section, returned to the province on the 4th and reported that as of now, over 200 people have died in northern Hui'an. Since the implementation of traffic restrictions and injections, the epidemic has subsided slightly. In addition, the Xiamen Port Quarantine Station announced on the 4th that plague is prevalent in Hui'an and nearby towns. Starting from the 5th, all ships and boats from Hui'an, Quanzhou, Anhai, and Dongshi, as well as people coming to Xiamen, must undergo inspection before being allowed to enter the port.</p>
<p>In addition, plague has been discovered in the third district of Zhangpu County in the Zhangzhou area. Over 30 people have died in Xiashen Village in that district, and over 20 people have died in Helin. It has also been found that plague has recently been discovered in Tingyangbu and Xitan in Zhao'an City. On average, over ten people are dying of the plague every day, with Tingyangbu being the most severe. In the residence of Xu Yongming in that area, four out of six family members died within three days, and the other two are also infected and in critical condition. The county authorities have planned prevention and control measures.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province to Pilot Land Tax Stamps</h3>
<p>Using Tax Stamps to Replace Currency for Paying Land Tax</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: In order to improve the method of collecting land tax, increase administrative efficiency, and eliminate corruption in land tax collection, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance has specially piloted a "Land Tax Stamp" system. The so-called land tax stamp is a type of voucher used to pay land tax, and its form and function are similar to stamp duty stamps and postage stamps, except that it distinguishes the scope of land. The purpose of implementing this system is to replace currency with tax stamps for paying land tax and to replace the old grain certificates with tax stamps affixed to vouchers. This can eliminate the malpractices of arbitrary charges, demands for bribes, and embezzlement. On the other hand, it can prevent forgery, theft, and abandonment of certificates. The most distinctive feature of land tax stamps is that the collection procedure is simple and it eliminates corruption in land tax collection. Other benefits include ease of safekeeping, ease of standardization and management, and ease of transfer. Land tax stamps are divided into five categories and 27 types: red stamps from 1 fen to 9 fen (9 types), green stamps from 1 jiao to 9 jiao (9 types), yellow stamps from 1 yuan to 5 yuan (5 types), blue stamps for 10 yuan, 20 yuan, and 50 yuan (3 types), and purple stamps for 100 yuan (1 type). All are printed by the Department of Finance. The county governments list the types and quantities needed and submit them to the banks that collect tax payments. The banks then collect the tax stamps in accordance with certain procedures. When businesses pay land tax, they bring the land tax collection voucher issued in advance by the county government to the tax collection office of the bank to purchase tax stamps for the amount due. The tax collector then affixes the tax stamps of the same value to the voucher and the payment stub, stamps the seam with the bank's seal, cuts along the seam, and hands the voucher to the business for safekeeping. The payment stub is then handed over to the accounting clerk for registration and then to the registry clerk for cancellation in the collection register. In order to ensure that the land tax stamp system has a standard to follow, the Department of Finance has drafted 24 provisional measures, which have been approved and implemented by the Provincial Government Committee at its 877th meeting. According to the person in charge of the department, these measures are drafted based on the following two principles: one is to seek simple and thorough procedures, and the other is to consider reducing the difficulties in promotion and preventing malpractices. There are clear regulations on the production, affixing, auditing, etc., of land tax stamps. Subsequently, the measures will be revised and supplemented based on the results of the pilot program. Once the credibility of the tax stamps is established, measures for the sale and payment of land tax on behalf of others will also be added to facilitate the payment of land tax by the people. This land tax stamp method has been ordered by the Department of Finance to be piloted in Yangzhong County starting from the second term of the 25th year. Since the start of tax collection in the county last month, the situation has been extremely smooth. From the 16th year, Zhenjiang, Taining, Jintan, Taicang, Taixing, Jiangdu, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, Suining, Shuyang, Dangshan, Taixing, and Kunshan, Danyang, and other 13 counties that have completed the land declaration will continue to pilot the program. During this period, the Department of Finance will send personnel to investigate and study at any time so that this innovation in the history of land tax can be promoted conveniently and become more perfect. According to the person in charge of the Department of Finance, the department will, at the end of the 26th year, based on the results of the pilot program in Yangzhong and other 13 counties, promulgate formal measures for land tax stamps and promote them throughout the province.</p>
<h3>Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway to be Converted into a Branch Line of the Beijing-Ganzhou Railway</h3>
<p>Saving Expenses to Repay Japanese Debt</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway is the only artery for Jiangxi to reach the Yangtze River. It is 128.35 kilometers long and has outstanding Japanese debt of 11,329,111 Japanese yen in principal and interest, as well as domestic debt of over 7 million yuan. Since it was taken over by the Ministry of Railways in 1929, the monthly operating income has reached 100,000 yuan, but the expenses are at least 90,000 yuan, and in lean months, the income may not even cover the expenses, leaving no ability to repay the debt. The Japanese creditor group then declared that it would demand management of the railway. Subsequently, the Ministry of Railways sent Fan Zhiyuan, the director of the railway, to Japan to negotiate with the creditor, the East Asia Industrial Development Company of Japan, and agreed to suspend the interest on the debt and repay it in installments. It is said that the reason why the company was able to be particularly accommodating was that after the completion of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway had lost its role in controlling Jiangxi's transportation. Even if it managed the railway according to the agreement, it would be difficult to achieve its ideal goals. It would be better to sell the assets and seek profits. Moreover, the railway was affected by the continuous banditry in Jiangxi Province, and the rural production declined, resulting in a significant decline in business. After the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the import and export goods had to pass through the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway from Jiujiang, which required paying half the customs tax, resulting in a daily decline in freight. Passenger transport also plummeted. It is said that the Ministry of Railways decided to merge the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway into the Beijing-Ganzhou Railway Bureau for management and convert it into a branch line of the Beijing-Ganzhou Railway in order to save all expenses and use the savings to repay the debt, as the Ministry of Railways stipulates that the Japanese debt will be repaid in installments, with funds allocated by the central government and the operating income of the railway jointly bearing the burden. If the operating income is only enough to cover the expenses, it will inevitably affect the repayment of the debt. (May 2)</p>
<h3>Land Value Tax Rate in Beijing to be Reduced</h3>
<p>City Government Decides to Limit it to Three Years - Mayor Ma Issues Explanation</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: The city government held its 426th municipal meeting on the morning of the 7th. Mayor Ma, the chairman, first heard reports from the secretary-general and the heads of various bureaus and offices on important cases handled by the secretariat and various bureaus. Then, the motions were discussed and approved. Under the principle of not changing the land value and tax rate, the city-wide land value tax will be collected at 90% of the original rate. Self-occupied land and self-cultivated land will be given an additional 80% discount according to law, limited to three years. The proposal will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before implementation. As for the question of how to divide self-occupied land, self-cultivated land, and rented land within the same property area, it will be handed over to Councilor Zhang and the Finance, Land, and Public Works Bureaus for joint deliberation. Regarding the reduction of land value tax, Mayor Ma also made the following statement:</p>
<p>"Since the collection of land value tax in this city was approved by the Executive Yuan, citizens have repeatedly requested a reduction. The government, in consideration of the people's sentiments, has made every effort to ease the burden on taxpayers, except for the tax rate, which was approved by the central government and cannot be changed. The tax exemption for land with restricted use and the tax exemption for land passed by roads have been ordered to be implemented. After detailed investigation, it is necessary to temporarily reduce the collection of land value tax, as the economy of the people in this city still needs to be cultivated and supported. Therefore, it was proposed at today's municipal meeting for discussion and was decided that the collection of land value tax will be temporarily reduced by 10% across the board for a period of three years. Those who meet the requirements of Article 197 of the Land Law for self-occupied land will be given an additional 20% discount according to law. In other words, the land use tax will be collected at 90% across the board, and the self-occupied land tax will be collected at 72%. If a portion is self-occupied and a portion is rented out, it will still be regarded as self-occupied land, so as to take care of the people's difficulties while still taking into account the legal discount right given to the people by Article 297 of the Land Law. The original land value tax rate for improved land and construction land in this city was set at 14 per thousand. If it is collected at 90%, the tax rate will be reduced to slightly more than 12 per thousand. The self-occupied land can be given an additional 20% discount according to law, so the self-occupied land tax rate is equivalent to being reduced to 10 per thousand. The original agricultural land tax rate was set at 10 per thousand. After this reduction, the tax rate for self-cultivated land is only slightly more than 7 per thousand, and the tax rate for rented land is 9 per thousand. It can be said that the government is generous to the people. I hope that all citizens can appreciate the heavy burden of the capital construction and the financial constraints of the city government and enthusiastically pay the taxes."</p>

After interrogation by the patrol officer, he claimed his name was Qian Baizhou, and the silver was purchased from Tiancheng Silver House in Shaoxing and intended to be transported to Shanghai to make jewelry. The outpost sent a document to the Chengguan Public Security Bureau for verification, stating that the smuggling of silver was related to the ban. After interrogation by the Chengguan Public Security Bureau, it was considered that the case required further investigation, and Qian Baizhou was transferred to the county government for verification.</p>

<p>Patrol boat No. 15 of the 75th Squadron of the 1st District of the 3rd Bureau of the Liangzhe Tax Police Corps was transporting public salt to Zhenhai to pay taxes on the morning of the 5th, five days after. Upon leaving Zhenhai to patrol for smugglers at 11:50 p.m., while sailing on the Qi'tou waters of Zhoushan, it happened to meet the Xinrui'an Wheel traveling between Shanghai and Wenzhou. Both parties did not dodge in time, resulting in a collision. The patrol boat was immediately breached and sank. The crew all fell into the water. Zhou Weisheng, the captain of the Xinrui'an Wheel, supervised the sailors to carry out the rescue, and fortunately, all of them were rescued. The patrol boat immediately sank, and all the sixteen rifles, two wooden-cased guns, over twenty artillery pieces, many boxes of ammunition, and many sets of tax police cotton-padded uniforms were lost to the flood. Sun Xiangfu, the captain of the tax police team, took the boat to Zhen on the morning of the 6th, reported to the Navigation Administration Office, and then took a boat with Wu Shanbiao, the captain of the 74th Squadron, to Shanghai to negotiate compensation.</p>
<p>Judgment on Yuanli Factory Debt</p>
<p>Yuanli Rice Factory on Dongsheng Road, Jiangdong, was opened by rice merchant Chen Ruifu. This year, due to poor turnover, it was closed down. The factory had mortgaged the rice and grain it stored to Jukangzhuang on Jiangxia Street for a large sum of money. The factory failed to repay the large sum by this time, so Jukang brought a lawsuit to the criminal court of the court of Zou, which declared the factory innocent, so they filed a lawsuit in the same court to seek compensation for the debt. The case was judged by the civil court on the 6th, and the defendant Chen Ruifu was ordered to compensate the plaintiff 9,190 yuan in national currency, and interest calculated from February 1 of this year until the end of the execution date, in accordance with the large debt precedents for the debt.</p>

<p>The Ninth Annual Elementary School Joint Sports Meet of this city, which opened on the sixth of this month, concluded successfully yesterday after two and a half days of effort. Because the grouping standards for this session were different from previous sessions, it is not possible to compare them with previous records, but the overall scores are still good. A total of six championships were awarded. The men's championships in all divisions were swept by Special District One. The women's A and B championships went to the Second District of South Shanghai, and the internal division went to Zhabei. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Group Performances</p>
<p>Yesterday was the final day of the conference, with a total of twelve group exercise programs. Among them, the barehanded exercises of Simei, performed by the Huanong Elementary School, were lively and the steps were neat. Qingru's "Small Army," Youying's "Fear of Non-Resistance," and the "Airplanes Coming" of the Municipal Middle School, and the "Reserve Army" of Chongshi were all national defense exercises with significant meaning. Weida's "National Flower Exercise" was also commendable, and the imitative exercises of the deaf and mute, which used hand gestures to direct, were quite amusing.</p>
<p>Overview of the Conference</p>
<p>The number of participants in this conference was larger than in the previous session, and the group exercise programs were especially rich, with quite novel teaching materials. The track and field scores were good. Most commendable was that rural elementary school students won many awards in this session. These little heroes help their parents with labor at home after their daily lessons, and already have hardworking muscles and healthy bodies. If they are trained properly, it will not be difficult to surpass the urban areas in the future. In addition, the spirit of the conference was very good, the students were very disciplined, and there were no bad incidents in the past few days, which is the best achievement of the conference. The diligence and efforts of the non-officials were also particularly noteworthy.</p>

<h3>Acting Mayor Yu and Hua An Company Hosted a Banquet for Overseas Chinese Aviators Yesterday</h3>
<p>Continued to Visit the Aviation Construction Branch in the Morning, Promised to Fund Expansion of the Library</p>
<p>Xu Qixing and Chen Yiyan, young overseas Chinese aviators from Java, visited the Shanghai branch of the China Aviation Construction Association again yesterday morning. They were received by Wang Xiaolai, a member of the association's standing committee, and talked for an hour. Xu Jun said that the association's library did not have many books, so he generously agreed to provide funding. In the future, they will collect aviation books from various countries to enrich the content of the library. Then, they took a group photo to commemorate the occasion. At noon, Acting Mayor Yu hosted a banquet, and at 7:30 pm, Du Yuesheng, Lu Yuequan, and others from the Hua An Cooperative Life Insurance Company hosted a banquet. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor's Banquet</p>
<p>At noon, Acting Mayor Yu invited Xu and Chen to participate in the regular meeting of the city's party, government, military, and business leaders. During the meeting, Acting Mayor Yu stood up and delivered a welcome speech, stating that the two of them were the first overseas Chinese to return to the country for sightseeing and fly their own airplanes. This not only made the Chinese people aware of the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for their motherland, but also aroused a lot of interest in the aviation industry. He heard that the two of them had returned to the country and were willing to devote all their efforts to developing aviation in the motherland, which was warmly welcomed and anticipated by the people of the country. Then, Xu Jun gave a reply, saying, "Chairman Acting Mayor Yu and gentlemen, we are very grateful for the warm welcome from all walks of life since we returned to the country. Since we first entered the country, we have heard and seen that the people of the country are doing their best to develop the country, which gives us endless hope for the future of the country and overseas Chinese. We hope to use our weak abilities to contribute to the country. We believe that our country has thousands of years of beautiful and immortal culture as a solid foundation. If it is completed with modern systems, it will surely guide us to a bright future. A German professor once said, 'Chinese culture teaches people to live in peace and contentment, which is truly wise life.' However, as times change, we cannot only stick to this wise life, but should adopt a scientific and progressive way of life so that we can enjoy peace and security. Today, the mayor's generous hospitality has increased our enthusiasm to serve the motherland. We would like to express our deep gratitude."</p>
<p>Hua An's Banquet</p>
<p>At 7:30 pm yesterday, Hua An Cooperative Life Insurance Company hosted a banquet on the eighth floor of the company to welcome Xu and Chen and invited Shanghai leaders from all walks of life to accompany them. The guests and hosts included Xu Qixing, Chen Yiyan, Yang Xiaotian, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaofan, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Lin Kanghou, Song Ziliang, Song Zian, Chen Jian'an, Mu Ouchu, Huang Renzhi, Xi Yushu, Wu Qiding, Zhang Weiru, Hu Yunzhuang, Liu Weijun, Yang Zhixiong, Ye Liangcai, Yu Yefeng, You Jusun, Ruan Weiyang, Ding Wushi, Jiang Xizhang, Lu Yuequan, Jing Qiankun, Yu Ci, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Lu Weiping, Qu Shaoyi, Pan Zhiwen, Chen Zijie, Lu Wenshao, Gu Bowei, Wang Liangdi, Long Huibai, Sheng Pihua, Chen Sidu, Lu Jinwen, Lu Zhaozhang, Sun Daosheng, Yang Zhisheng, Lu Weifan, Lu Weihan, Zhang Yuliang, Tian Zhibu, Li Qintang, Yu Junhou, Yu Zhende, and more than forty others, making it a grand occasion. During the banquet, Lu Yuequan, general manager of the company, delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Today, Mr. Du Yuesheng and I, on behalf of the company, are hosting a banquet to welcome the overseas Chinese Xu Qixing and Chen Yiyan back to the country to wash away the dust. We feel very happy. The two gentlemen have lived overseas for a long time. This time, they have returned to the country and are meeting with their compatriots, which is like family members reuniting after a long separation. There are many words that they want to say from the bottom of their hearts, but they don't know where to start. Three months ago, I went to Nanyang and met Mr. Xu. At first sight, I felt as close as brothers. Mr. Xu frequently asked about the current situation of the motherland, and his concern for the motherland was overflowing with words. At that time, Mr. Xu expressed his intention to return to the country to investigate, and I also strongly supported him. Now, Mr. Xu has indeed returned to the country with Mr. Chen to meet with the elders and brothers of the motherland, and his joy is difficult to express in words. Mr. Xu's business in Java, Nanyang, is very great and is indeed the leader of the overseas Chinese businessmen there. Our company has a branch in Java and has received a lot of help from Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu sees that our company is run by Chinese businessmen and is a social enterprise that is beneficial to the Chinese community, so he protects our company with his patriotic enthusiasm. This is something that our company is very grateful for to Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu is a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman, but his ambition is for the aviation industry, so he went to England to study aviation and studied with Mr. Chen, and both achieved excellent results. The plane that Mr. Xu drove back to the country this time was made by Mr. Xu himself, so Mr. Xu is not only proficient in flying skills, but also knows a lot about aircraft manufacturing. Mr. Chen also has the same ability, which our domestic compatriots admire very much for Mr. Xu and Mr. Chen. I think that our country is currently striving to make progress in various construction projects, and there is a great need for the aviation industry. Now, Mr. Xu and Mr. Chen are very concerned about the current situation of the motherland, and they are also very willing to use their strengths to serve the motherland in the aviation industry, which is very much needed by the motherland. This is something that our domestic compatriots welcome very much for the two gentlemen and are willing to use the same patriotic enthusiasm to take care of the two gentlemen to the best of their ability. The leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai who are present today also have this grand aspiration. The two gentlemen, Xu and Chen, are the first overseas Chinese to drive airplanes to their country from overseas. I hope that the two gentlemen will be able to see the progress of their motherland during this time in the motherland to comfort their usual concerns about the motherland. In the future, they will be able to fly back to the motherland from time to time to support the aviation industry of the motherland. This is what our domestic compatriots are extremely looking forward to. I respectfully propose a toast and wish the two gentlemen a bright future and win glory for the country." Next, guest Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, followed by Xu Qi and Jun's reply, saying, "I am very grateful for the warm welcome from all walks of life after returning to the country. The whole country has been unified, and the leaders of all industries are also united in good faith, which is a cause for celebration for the future. Hua An Company's business is developed and serves overseas Chinese, which makes domestic and foreign compatriots closer, which I deeply admire and wish its business success." Next, Mr. Chen Yiyan replied, saying that although he is good at flying skills, he is not good at social etiquette. This time, he returned to the country by flying from England to contribute what he has learned to the motherland. He is very grateful for this grand banquet and hopes that the leaders from all walks of life present will give him guidance.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Office Provides District Guidance</h3>
<p>Reporting and Paying Taxes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance wrote to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "Dear Sir/Madam, since the implementation of the income tax is just beginning, it is difficult for all sectors to fully understand the interpretation of the law, the calculation of tax amounts, and the procedures for reporting and paying taxes for a while. This office has always provided detailed answers to inquiries from all sectors in writing or orally. However, recently, many staff members of businesses in the north, south, and special districts of this city have come to the office (or requested by telephone) to say that they are still unfamiliar with filling out tax returns and calculating tax amounts. Moreover, since the partners are engaged in business, they have little time to spare, and they feel it is difficult to travel back and forth to report and pay taxes. They have requested that personnel be sent to provide guidance. After investigating the above-mentioned sections claimed by the business companies, they are factually true and should be implemented in districts to facilitate them. We have discussed this with the committee members of your association, and they have agreed. In addition to handling this matter, we are writing to inform you and hope that you will pass this on to all industry associations to notify all businesses."</p>

The celebratory decorations of British stores have also been completely completed. The British Overseas Chinese Association hosted all British overseas Chinese at No. 600 Hongqiao Road from 3:00 pm to 7:00 pm yesterday, with a large number of British women and children arriving. After the meeting, special buses sent them off. Today is Sunday, and all British overseas Chinese will gather in churches to bless the British King.</p>
<p>British Envoy Returns to Beijing</p>
<p>Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday to attend the grand ball held by the British overseas Chinese to celebrate the coronation of the British King the night before last. It was originally planned to return to Beijing after presiding over the celebration ceremony on the 12th, but it has now been decided that the ceremony will be presided over by Lieutenant General Leader, commander of the British fleet in China. Therefore, he only stayed in Shanghai for two days and returned to Beijing by the 11:00 pm night express train last night. It is scheduled to host a celebration party in Beijing on the 12th to entertain Chinese officials and diplomatic representatives from various countries.</p>
<p>Citizens' Congratulations</p>
<p>This month 12th is the coronation ceremony of King George VI of England. The First Special District Citizens' Union of this city has issued a notice to all its district branches to celebrate by flying flags on this day. Lin Kanghou, chairman of the association, will also go to the British Consulate General in Shanghai to congratulate him at that time.</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Fly Flags</p>
<p>The Shipping Association yesterday issued a notice to all large and small shipping companies in the city, stating that this month 12th is the date of the coronation ceremony of the British King. At that time, all Chinese commercial ships, whether importing or exporting, and those anchored in the port, will celebrate by flying full flags (i.e., hanging the flags of all countries on the entire ship) to show joint celebration. The companies have notified the captains of each ship to comply. As for the company side, flags will also be hung on the same day to express the meaning of celebration.</p>
<p>Traffic Regulations</p>
<p>King George VI of England will hold a coronation ceremony on this month 12th. The British overseas Chinese in this city will also hold a grand celebration in the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road from 9:15 pm to 11:30 pm on the evenings of the 11th and 12th. Everything has been arranged in advance in the racecourse, and it is gorgeously decorated. The electric lights will be bright at night, shining like daylight. All ceremonies will be carried out under thousands of electric lights. However, in order to take into account the congestion of visitors, admission tickets are issued, with prices ranging from five yuan, two yuan, and one yuan to show restrictions. However, the five-yuan tickets have all been sold out in mid-April. Currently, there are still some two-yuan and one-yuan tickets left, but the number is not much. In order to maintain order in the field, the lawn on the south side of the racecourse has been designated as a private car parking area, which is sufficient for 2,000 cars to park. All cars will enter through the gate on Mahuo Road and park on the lawn on the south side in order. Before the celebration ceremony is over each night, no unauthorized movement is allowed. It must wait until the program is over before being allowed to open out of the gate at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Racecourse Road in a fish-like manner. The preparatory staff has specially opened an exit there. Any vehicles are not allowed to park around the racecourse, and it is stipulated that vehicles should avoid passing through the east-west sections of Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Carter Road from the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 3rd days and must detour to other roads. This temporary traffic measure and detailed regulations are carefully instructed by the Traffic Department of the Bureau of Public Works. Special drawings are now made, and each item is separately as left. For fear that drivers may not understand, the Traffic Department has remade instruction signs that are seven feet high and placed them at important roads and intersections. In addition, there is another point that the reporter has learned to be true, which is enough for all walks of life to know that the celebration ceremony has been selected to be held on the ground in front of the racecourse grandstand, but the surrounding area is shielded by obstacles fifteen feet high, so the outside cannot be seen at all. Even looking down from buildings six or seven stories high is difficult to achieve the purpose. In addition, there are rumors that there will be parades and fireworks displays on that day. After a thorough investigation with the preparatory office, it is said that there is no such program. The 10th has been set as the rehearsal period. Whether there are various programs rumored outside will be clear at that time. Temporary Traffic Regulations ㊀ All kinds of vehicles in the field are responsible for command by the police. ㊁ All kinds of vehicles from outside (self-prepared cars or scheduled cars used by visitors) will enter the field through the gate on Mahuo Road opposite Weihaiwei Road. ㊂ All kinds of vehicles in the field are only allowed to exit through the newly opened large bucket at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Racecourse Road. If it is a self-prepared car, it will be parked in the designated parking area. It is not allowed to start without authorization before the celebration ceremony is over. ㊃ Drivers of all kinds of vehicles going to the Racecourse to participate in or visit the grand ceremony should observe the following regulations and detour to their destinations (A) West section of Jing'an Temple Road, vehicles from outside should turn south on Tongfu Road and reach Mahuo Road via Weihaiwei Road to enter the field (B) West section of Fuxu Road, vehicles from outside 1. should go straight to Mahuo Road via Weihaiwei Road to enter the field, 2. go north from Fuxu Road via Tongfu Road and Weihaiwei Road to reach Mahuo Road and enter the field (C) East section of Aidaoya Road, vehicles from outside should go west along the original road and then turn to Mahuo Road to enter the field. ㊄ Drivers of vehicles should try to avoid passing through the Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road sections between Tongban Road to the east and Yu Qiaqing Road to the west. If it is absolutely necessary, then you should turn south from Nanjing Road, turn into Yu Qiaqing Road, detour to Aidaoya Road to the west, and then turn into Mahuo Road to enter the field. ㊅ Mahuo Road (from Weihaiwei Road in the south to Jing'an Temple Road in the north) is closed to traffic and used as a parking lot for VIPs ㊆ Drivers should pay close attention to and abide by the instruction signs at various main intersections ㊇ After the ceremony is over, all vehicles should disperse and return, and should drive according to the following two designated routes, (A) turn right at the exit and follow Yu Qiaqing Road towards Aidaoya Road, (B) turn right at the exit and follow Yu Qiaqing Road towards Aidaoya Road, or turn left and follow Yu Qiaqing Road, turn into Fuzhou Road, but the Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road area east of Tongfu Road should still be avoided.</p>

<h3>Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company Organizes Timber Company</h3>
<p>Personnel in Various Departments Continue to Be Hired</p>
<p>The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company, with an original capital of 20 million yuan, has already started construction on the Chengdu-Chongqing section of the railway a month ago. However, due to rising land purchase and material prices, it has exceeded the budget by a lot. Therefore, it has increased its capital by 5 million yuan, which has been approved by the board of directors and will be submitted to the next shareholders' meeting for ratification. Here are the details:</p>
<p>Rising Material Prices Increase Capital</p>
<p>The Sichuan-Guizhou Company is building a railway from Chengdu to Chongqing with an original capital of 20 million yuan. The route has been surveyed and materials have been ordered. However, the price of iron has soared, materials are expensive, and the land used has also been negotiated by the Sichuan-Guizhou provincial authorities at the request of the owners, and the company has agreed to compensate them. In total, the average is 45 yuan per mu, which is not enough for the original capital. Therefore, it was approved at the third board meeting held in Shanghai the day before yesterday to increase the capital by 5 million yuan, which will be submitted to the next shareholders' meeting for ratification. Zhang Jia'ao, Minister of Railways and director of the company, has instructed Xie Fencheng to take over because he has no time to serve concurrently. Xu Kan, Vice Minister, has also been instructed to serve as a director to be dispatched by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Personnel in Various Departments Continue to Be Hired</p>
<p>The company's general office is located in Shanghai, and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Engineering Bureau is located in Chongqing. The internal organization has been finalized, and personnel in various departments continue to be hired. Qiu Chuanmeng is the director of the General Affairs Department, Lu Jinggui is the director of the Technical Department, Qi Zhanyi and Ouyang Ling are the chief engineers, Wei Huanzhang is the commissioner, Wang Zuliang is the chief auditor, Chen Zuyi is the deputy director of the Engineering Bureau, Zhang Enfang is the head of the Accounting Department of the Engineering Bureau, and Gu Weilian is hired as the accounting inspector and Wu Zhitian as the director of the secretariat of the board of directors and Wang Xudong as the secretary in accordance with the investment contract. However, Mr. Wu was sent abroad and is temporarily replaced by Jiang Jiamei, director of the company's secretariat.</p>
<p>Timber Company's Capital Determined</p>
<p>The Chengdu-Chongqing Road has now started construction. Gan Xuyong, director of the company, came to Shanghai this time to participate in the board meeting and contacted Song Ziwen and others to invite them to inspect Sichuan. In order to relieve the victims of the severe Sichuan disaster this year, the company has consulted with the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association and agreed to do work relief. However, the method is still being discussed. In addition, the company has decided to purchase the sleepers used in the interior and has jointly established the Sichuan Timber Company with the Ministry of Railways and the Sichuan Provincial Government, with a capital of 2 million yuan. The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Railways and the Sichuan Provincial Government each subscribe 200,000 yuan, and 700,000 yuan in commercial shares are raised in Shanghai and Sichuan. The Shanghai side is shared by the Sichuan-Guizhou Company and the Construction Bank, and the bank sends personnel to start preparations immediately.</p>
<h3>News Briefs</h3>
<p>Fast Profit Breaks Anchor Chain</p>
<p>The "Fast Profit" steamship of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's upper Yangtze line, which came to Shanghai from Yichang this time, broke its anchor chain on the 7th of this month when it arrived downstream of Anqing. The captain urgently steered the ship back to Shanghai and reported to the head office to arrange for a new anchor chain before sailing upstream again, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<p>Chinese People Fight for Pilotage Rights</p>
<p>The section from Tongsha to Shanghai outside Wusong requires foreign ships arriving in Shanghai to hire pilots to guide them into the port. However, this pilotage right has always been held by foreigners and managed by the customs. There are a total of forty pilots, and Chinese people are not allowed to participate. In recent years, the Chinese people have repeatedly fought for the government to take back the pilotage rights for this section and allow Chinese people to manage it themselves, but it has not been successful. Recently, a vacancy occurred among the foreign pilots. Jin Yueshi, a senior figure in China's maritime circles, fought hard to take the examination at the Jianghai Customs and, as of yesterday, has passed the examination and obtained a pilot's position. Mr. Jin has already resigned from his position as captain of the "Fair" steamship at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and will immediately go to the customs to take up his new post.

Shanghai's Yi Shen, Xin Chang Shen Tai, and other timber companies have all ordered large quantities of timber and have chartered a large number of ocean-going ships to transport them to Shanghai. It is reported that the Ministry of Railways has also purchased 20,000 tons (each ton is calculated as 40 cubic feet) and will begin loading and unloading in Shanghai from June 1st.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin, Silk Weaving, and Other Industries Initiate the Establishment of the China Artificial Silk Factory</h3>
<p>First Investigate Factory Sites in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou; Investigate Mechanical Engineering in Germany and Italy</p>
<p>Leaders of the Shanghai silk and satin industry, silk weaving industry, cotton cloth industry, dyeing and weaving industry, knitting industry, and artificial silk businesses, such as Luo Qinghua, Cai Shengbai, Ke Ganchen, and Zhu Wenqi, as well as financial entrepreneurs Guo Bingwen, Wu Yun Chu, Chen Qin Shi, Pan Gongzhan, and Shou Jingwei, have initiated the China Artificial Silk Factory, which has been in the planning stages for three years. Recently, progress has begun to be seen. It is reported that the factory's organization is based on the principle of joint production, cooperation, and consumption by the textile industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. It is planned to initially establish an artificial silk factory with a daily output of three tons and gradually expand it to achieve self-sufficiency in textile raw materials. First, the silk and satin industry and other trade associations petitioned the government to promote and encourage it. Up until early spring of this year, the initiators, Luo Qinghua and others, jointly submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry, which was submitted to the Industrial Incentive Review Committee for review of specialized areas. It is reported that the factory's preparations are progressing smoothly, and many leaders from Beijing and Shanghai have participated in the initiation. Domestic and foreign experts have drafted a business plan. In mid-last month, Luo Qinghua, the temporary director of the factory's preparatory office, accompanied by technical experts, went to Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou to investigate factory sites and examine water sources. The factory's initiators, Guo Bingwen and Wu Yun Chu, have recently traveled to Europe one after another and are responsible for investigating mechanical engineering in Germany and Italy. It is reported that the factory will soon publicly raise shares and welcome domestic entrepreneurs to participate in cooperation.</p>
<h3>The New "Xin Duan An" Steamer on the Shanghai-Wenzhou Line Sinks a Patrol Boat in a Collision</h3>
<p>Tax Police Send Personnel to Shanghai for Negotiations</p>
<p>The "Xin Duan An" steamer, owned by the Shen An Steamship Company at No. 400 on the Outer Bund Road in Shanghai, which operates between Shanghai and Wenzhou, set sail from Wenzhou to Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the 4th of this month. At 11:50 PM on the 5th, when passing through the Qitou waters of Zhoushan, it collided with patrol boat No. 74 of the 75th team of the first district of the third team of the Zhejiang Tax Police Bureau due to the late hour and unusually dark sky. The "Xin Duan An" steamer only suffered scratches to the bow due to its sturdy hull, while the Tax Police Bureau's patrol boat immediately sank. All eighteen people on board the patrol boat, including fourteen tax police officers, two helmsmen, and team leader Sun Xiangfu and squad leader Chen Wencheng, fell into the water. Captain Zhou Weisheng of the "Xin Duan An" steamer supervised the crew to launch lifeboats to rescue them, and all were rescued safely. However, all the rifles, wooden-cased guns, homemade cannons, and police uniforms inside the boat were lost in the flood. Afterwards, the "Xin Duan An" steamer was ordered by Tax Police Team Leader Sun Xiangfu to sail to Zhenhai and report to the Ningbo Office of the Shanghai Navigation Administration for investigation and disposition. Captain Zhou Weisheng of the steamer also paid 200 yuan to the tax police to replenish the lost clothing. As the steamer was carrying more than sixty passengers and was fully loaded with passengers and cargo, it was released at the request of the shipowner and arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM on the 7th, docking at Pier No. 12 on the Outer Bund. The tax police team sent a representative, Wu Shanliang, to Shanghai on board the ship to handle negotiations.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Cables Government Requesting a Ban on Wheat Exports</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry, stating, "To the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry: Regarding the letter from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Inland Mechanized Flour Mill Industry Association on the 7th of this month, it states that the quantity of flour produced by our country's flour mills is increasing year by year, and the consumption of raw material wheat is also increasing annually. Since 1931, all imports of foreign wheat have been valued at around 70 to 80 million each year. Even though the domestic wheat harvests in the past two years were bountiful, according to the statistics published by the Ministry of Industry, the wheat production in 1936 increased by more than 70 million dan compared to 1935, it was initially thought that flour mills would not need to seek foreign raw materials. However, the result is that annual foreign wheat imports are still in the range of 20 to 30 million. Upon investigation, when the new wheat came on the market last year, our association telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry, requesting a ban on wheat exports or the imposition of an export tax on wheat to maintain the people's food supply and reassure the public, due to the impact of foreign merchants exporting wheat, which affected the people's food supply and hindered flour mills. Subsequently, we received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating that in July of this year, the average wheat price in Shanghai was only about 4.40 yuan per shi dan, which was 80 to 90 jiao lower than the price of 5.30 yuan per shi dan when the new wheat came on the market. Also, according to the investigation and statistics of the National Tariff Commission, the wheat purchased by foreign merchants in our country is at most only about 100,000 metric tons. At a time when wheat prices are slightly rebounding and there are a small number of foreign exports, a sudden ban on wheat exports or the imposition of an export tax would not be in line with the government's original intention of maintaining the rural economy. As a result, our association's request was not implemented. Now, upon investigation, the prices of wheat futures for June, July, August, and September on the Shanghai Grain Exchange are all around 5.45 yuan per shi dan, which is comparable to the market price of new wheat last year. However, the market price of wheat is still about 30% higher than the price of rice. In addition, continuous rainfall and fluctuating temperatures have had a significant impact on spring plowing, especially for wheat. Therefore, the price of wheat is bound to rise and not fall, which is sufficient to protect the rural economy. If, due to a poor wheat harvest, foreign merchants are allowed to transport wheat for export on the one hand, and we rely on foreign wheat imports on the other, the outflow of funds would be detrimental to both the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, we have specially listed the facts and respectfully request your association to forward them to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry, and to issue an order to ban wheat exports in order to maintain the people's food supply and reduce the trade deficit. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce bows, Yang." "According to reports, the flour mills are experiencing a shortage of raw materials due to the empty reserves of domestic wheat, the scarcity and high price of foreign wheat, and the average output of the factories is only about 30%. Therefore, the association's request is beneficial for maintaining production volume for the flour mills, preventing unemployment for the workers, and from the standpoint of the national economy. It is appropriate to telegraph your yuan (department) for review and approval, and to consider and handle it for the public good. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows, Yang."</p>
<h3>Seamen Request the Recovery of Pilotage Rights</h3>
<p>Further Delegates Sent to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>The various Chinese seamen's organizations, for the purpose of requesting the government to recover pilotage rights in order to strengthen national defense, previously organized a committee and sent delegates to Beijing to petition, obtaining satisfactory results. Subsequently, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee opened, and a majority of Central Committee members jointly proposed, "Implement the recovery of pilotage rights and place the pilotage personnel under the administration of the Ministry of Communications." It is now learned that this proposal has been approved by the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for handling. However, as this case has been forwarded for a long time, seamen from various regions have specially requested the committee to send personnel to the central government again to urge its implementation, in order to see it implemented as soon as possible. The association has now, at the request of seamen from various regions, sent delegates to Beijing with a written statement of reasons to urge the central government and the Executive Yuan, and at the same time telegraphed all sectors of the country, requesting unanimous support for the recovery in order to strengthen national defense.</p>
<h3>The Red Swastika Society Plans Disaster Relief for Five Provinces</h3>
<p>In view of the serious disasters in Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Ningxia, and Guizhou provinces this year, and the lack of food for the disaster victims, who are mostly filling their hunger with stone flour cakes, the China General Association of the World Red Swastika Society has joined forces with Red Swastika branches throughout the country to organize relief efforts. It has already raised tens of thousands of yuan in relief funds. Once the relief funds from various locations are received, they will be allocated to the disaster areas for emergency relief. The Southeast Office and the Wuxi branches have purchased a large quantity of flour and transported it to Henan Province for distribution. The association is pooling national efforts to organize relief for the five provinces this time, and hopes that philanthropists from all walks of life will provide unified assistance so that the disaster victims can be relieved. Guizhou Branch of the China Foreign Famine Relief Commission</p>
<h3>Telegraphed the General Association Again to Beg for Relief</h3>
<p>The China Foreign Famine Relief Association at No. 505 Henan Road previously received a telegram from the Guizhou branch reporting on the disaster and requesting assistance. This was reported previously. After receiving the telegram, the General Association telegraphed to inquire about the counties most severely affected in order to provide relief. The reply received stated, "To the General Association: We are grateful for your kind telegram inquiring about the severe disaster situation and the counties in urgent need of relief, and we admire your concern for the suffering of Guizhou. Upon investigation, 74 of the province's 81 counties have been affected by the disaster. Leaving aside the counties with relatively light disaster conditions, there are 62 counties hoping for relief, and 21 counties that cannot survive without relief, including Chishui, Zunyi, Tongzi, Renhuai, Guiyang, Anshun, Xingyi, Kelong, Weining, Zheng'an, Bijie, Zhenfeng, Huinan, Huaihe, Guanling, Zhenning, Fenggang, Pu'an, Xingren, Ernan, and Ceheng. In total, there are more than 2.72 million disaster victims, accounting for 30% of the province's population. The difficult situation has been detailed in previous telegrams. We earnestly request that you widely solicit donations and work together to provide relief.</p>
<h3>The Reality of the Drought in Guizhou</h3>
<p>Guizhou is a mountainous region with obstructed transportation. Since last summer, it has not rained for ten months, the fields are cracked and cannot be planted, the wells and springs are exhausted, the rivers are dry and silted up, and drinking water is extremely scarce. Residents have to fetch water for drinking from 20 to 30 miles away, and each load of water is sold for 40 to 50 cents of national currency, which is unheard of in ancient times. The price of rice has risen to 30 to 40 yuan per stone, and there is no way to purchase it. The disaster victims cannot even gather wild plants to fill their hunger. Many take Guanyin powder to fill their stomachs, but they die of abdominal distension within a few days. Diseases such as diphtheria, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, and spring plague are extremely prevalent in the affected counties, and deaths are common. The affected areas have reached more than 60 counties, with the counties in northern Guizhou being the most severely affected, followed by the counties in the western route, and then the counties in the southeastern route. Those affected account for three-quarters of the province, and there are more than 3 million disaster victims. In the most severely affected counties, not only are there no remaining grains in the homes, but there is also no green grass in the fields. Currently, the only way to provide relief is through emergency relief. The Guizhou Provincial Government and the Guizhou natives in Beijing, He Yingqin and others, telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to allocate funds for emergency relief. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To Chairman Chiang in Hangzhou: We have repeatedly received letters and telegrams from Governor Gu of the Guizhou Provincial Government and local elders, stating that the spring famine this year is extremely severe, and the disaster-stricken families have become warehouses, and the warehouses have long been empty. Spring plowing has not yet been planted, and the disaster area covers the entire province, which is unprecedented in recent decades. The starving people are crying out for help. Although the Relief Commission has issued 100,000 yuan and sent personnel to distribute it, it is a drop in the bucket due to the vast disaster area and is of no help. The Guizhou natives in Beijing have been meeting for days and have unanimously decided that we implore you to approve and allocate 1 million yuan in relief funds to the Guizhou Provincial Government to work with the local Relief Commission to effectively handle emergency relief in order to save the remaining people and avert the crisis. In urgent words, we beg you to approve our request. Serving, Yingqin, Wang Boqun, Gu Zhenglun, Gu Zhengding, Li Zhonggong, Zhou Zhongliang, Zhang Daofan, Gu Zhenggang, He Jiwu, He Congyan, Du Chen, Wang Shufang, Zhang Tingxiu, Shi Weihuan, Song Shuqiao, etc. kowtow, Dong." At the same time, Zhu Ziqiao was telegraphed to enter Guizhou to inspect the situation.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Ma Chen Donate Funds to Relieve the Sui Disaster</h3>
<p>The United Charity and Disaster Relief Association of this city received a telegram from the Ma Chen Overseas Chinese Donation Committee for Patriotic Charity, donating 1,446.98 yuan in national currency for disaster relief in Suiyuan. The original telegram stated, "We have repeatedly received letters from various domestic charitable organizations and reports in newspapers stating that since the war in Chahar and Suiyuan occurred, the disaster situation has been severe and relief is urgently needed. Domestic compatriots have been tightening their belts and promoting relief efforts, and overseas Chinese have been generously donating their salaries in response. Some have even donated their entire day's earnings for relief purposes. We believe that the overseas Chinese in this port have always been second to none in good deeds. Therefore, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce initiated a joint meeting of various community organizations, which unanimously agreed to organize the Ma Chen Overseas Chinese Donation Committee for Patriotic Charity to carry out fundraising and appeal on behalf of the disaster victims to provide assistance. As a result, a total of 788.75 Dutch guilders was donated, which was used by the Netherlands Wood Public Bank to purchase 1,446.98 yuan in national currency. The draft is presented above. We hope you will check and collect it and forward it to the Suiyuan disaster area to relieve the wounded and refugees. Although the amount is small and a drop in the bucket, it is only to fulfill the duties of the local compatriots. If the amount is collected properly, please send the receipt as soon as possible so that we can inform the donors and show our credibility. The Chairman of the Ma Chen Overseas Chinese Donation Committee for Patriotic Charity, Li Chengde, bows, Yu."</p>
<h3>Sichuan Students in Shanghai Plead for Disaster Victims Yesterday</h3>
<p>Meeting Today to Discuss Entertainment Relief Performances</p>
<p>The Sichuan Students Disaster Relief Association in Shanghai sent letters to the various charitable organizations, disaster relief associations, and overseas Chinese associations in Renji Hall yesterday, appealing for help. The original letter stated, "We respectfully inform you that the drought in our province is extremely severe, unprecedented in history, and there is also a widespread epidemic, with many deaths. Although the central government has allocated 1 million in public bonds, which have been converted into 700,000 yuan in cash, for emergency relief, the disaster area covers more than 130 counties, with more than 40 million disaster victims, which is a drop in the bucket and of no help. In addition to appealing to the central government for permission to issue public bonds for continued relief, we have always admired your concern for the suffering and famine, and we hereby respectfully request your support and special emergency relief, and the tens of millions of lives will be grateful. The Sichuan Students Disaster Relief Association in Shanghai bows." It is also reported that the association is scheduled to hold a joint meeting at 9:00 AM today to discuss entertainment relief performance plans.</p>
<h3>Gold Exchange Brokers Association Withholding Income Tax Law</h3>
<p>Meeting Held Yesterday to Discuss and Decide</p>
<p>The Gold Exchange Brokers Association of this city held a temporary meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at its office on North Wuxi Road to discuss the method of legally withholding the profit income tax of customers, as some brokers were not very clear about it. All the brokers attended the meeting, and Chairman Zhan Liansheng reported on the withholding method: ㊀ For non-industry merchants engaged in fixed-term trading, the broker should be responsible for reporting their income. ㊁ For merchants engaged in fixed-term trading with a capital of 2,000 yuan or more, the merchant should temporarily declare and pay the tax themselves according to law, but the broker should also be responsible for reporting the income. ㊂ In order to implement national policies and protect tax revenue, brokers will no longer accept entrustments from merchants with a capital of less than 2,000 yuan. Otherwise, they will be required to change the account name and withhold taxes in accordance with the regulations. ㊃ The dates for declaration and payment of withheld taxes will be advanced or delayed. For example, the tax for January, which was originally scheduled to be declared at the end of February and paid in mid-March, can now be extended to the end of April for declaration and payment. Also, the tax for March can be advanced to the end of April for declaration and payment.</p>

<h3>The Question of Public Prosecution and Private Prosecution in the Hei Lan Family Property Dispute</h3>
<p>The Zhou Family Handed Over Part of the Property; Questioning Whether They Were Formally Married</p>
<p>After Hei Lanqing, a resident of Pudong, died, his children discovered that his concubine, Zhou Huilin, colluded with Fu Jiafu (namely Fu Minqi), Hu Shulin, Peng Ren, and others to embezzle their father's inheritance. They reported this to the Lao Zha station, and Chinese detectives Wang Shusen, Pang Ruiqing, and detective Lu Shanji arrested Hu Shulin and Peng Ren first. The others were released on bail by the First Special District Court. Zhou Huilin and Fu Jiafu also surrendered themselves to the authorities a few days ago, as reported in this newspaper. In addition to the station initiating a public prosecution against Zhou Huilin and others, Hei's children also hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution. The case was continued in the Criminal Division of Judge Feng Shide yesterday morning. The station lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the station is prosecuting the defendants Zhou Huilin, Hu Shulin, and Fu Jiafu for embezzlement under Articles 335, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code, and is not prosecuting Peng Ren. During the extension period, the station discovered that the defendant had embezzled more than 58,000 yuan that Hei Lanqing had deposited in the Chun Yuan Bank on Tianjin Road, changed the account name, and changed the names of more than 6,000 shares of the Java Rubber Company and other stocks from Hei's name to Zhou Huilin's name, and sold some of them to the Lao Gongmao Foreign Company. Also, after opening a silver box that was brought from Hangzhou, it was found that there was a key inside, which was used to open the iron box stored in the Dade Bank on Tianjin Road. Therefore, he requested permission to have the box transferred to the case and opened for investigation. The facts of the case are extremely complex, and the station's investigation has not yet been completed, so he requested that the hearing be adjourned. The plaintiff's representative lawyer, Ma Shounian, and the defendants' representative lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Yu Xiangqin, argued fiercely over the issue of combining public and private prosecutions. The court ordered that the matter be examined after the trial. Hei Lanqing's third son then surrendered himself and testified that after receiving a telegram in Shanghai that his father was seriously ill, they rushed to Hangzhou, but their father had already died. At that time, they asked Zhou about their father's iron box seal key, etc., but Zhou claimed to be unaware of it. After negotiations, both parties agreed to hand over all of their father's property for legal distribution, but Zhou only handed over a portion, and most of the stocks, etc., were not handed over. Later, the transfer of the Hu and Peng families to the Zilai Fire Company occurred, and the arrest was reported to the court. The court then inquired whether Hei Lanqing had formally married Zhou. The reply was that Zhou was bought by their father for 400 yuan. When she came, she was covered in sores, which their family helped to heal, so there was no marriage. The defendant's lawyer immediately pointed out that his statement was inappropriate and would be dealt with separately according to law. After verifying the testimony, Judge Feng ordered that the case be adjourned and a special court be convened for another hearing.</p>

<h3>Yihua Rubber Factory Workers Beaten Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Three Seriously Injured, Lawsuit Filed</p>
<p>Over a hundred male and female workers were originally employed at the Yihua Rubber Factory on the Shanghai-Minhang Road. Recently, due to poor management by Zhou Bo, it was leased to Yihua Xinji to continue operations, with Chen Chun contracting all the work, and Chen subcontracting to Gao Zibing, Tang Huisheng, etc. This led to worker dissatisfaction over the collection of guarantee money. They have petitioned party and government organs and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for assistance. Yesterday morning, at about 8 o'clock, more than 20 of these workers were at the factory entrance inquiring about the start of work when they were suddenly attacked by over 40 thugs wielding sharp weapons. Workers Zhou Yunlong, Xu Zhenjia, and Zhang Debin were severely injured, and more than a dozen others sustained minor injuries. It is reported that the workers have submitted themselves to the District Court Prosecutor's Office for injury examination and have retained a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit, as well as petitioning party and government organs and the Federation of Trade Unions to demand the arrest of the perpetrators and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Estranged Couple: Wang Huaixuan Harasses Her Husband Endlessly</h3>
<p>Zhou Zhidong Cannot Bear Cohabitation; Defendant Fails to Appear for Interrogation</p>
<p>Zhou Zhidong, a local resident in his thirties who lives behind the Nanjing Grand Theater on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession and works at a foreign firm, married Wang Huaixuan, a local woman, in the sixth year of the Republic of China. Initially, their relationship was harmonious, but around the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, Wang Huaixuan's attitude suddenly changed. She constantly looked for trouble, causing quarrels with her mother-in-law or fighting with other women. In March of that year, Wang suddenly returned to Ningbo for a short time. Zhou Zhidong received a threatening letter stating that he should quickly resolve the matter with Wang Huaixuan, or else he would be dealt with using a handgun if he did not settle the matter with money. Zhou reported this letter to the French police and requested protection. Soon after, Wang suddenly returned home and daily engaged in veiled insults, banging on the table, throwing bowls, smashing four rice bowls, and placing a red-hot iron on the bed, attempting to set fire to the place. She also threatened to commit suicide. When these tactics failed, Wang changed her approach. One day, she ordered Lao Jiu Zhang to quickly deliver several hundred yuan worth of silk to her house. When it was delivered, she ordered it to be returned. The next day, she instructed a jewelry store to deliver over four thousand yuan worth of jewelry. On alternate days, she ordered three pairs of leather shoes to be delivered, foreign goods from Lihua Company, hand towels from Sanyou Industrial Society, and tin foil from Dingsheng Foil Shop. Each item was dismissed upon arrival, making the house look like a marketplace. Last month, Wang absconded with the money. Zhou, unable to bear his wife's harassment, commissioned lawyer Fang Houjie to file a petition with the Civil Court, requesting mediation for divorce from Wang Huaixuan. The court, upon receiving the petition, scheduled a hearing for yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Wang Shiqi, to convene both parties for mediation. Wang Huaixuan did not appear. Only the petitioner, Zhou Zhidong, attended with his lawyer, presenting his petition. The court declared the mediation unsuccessful and instructed the petitioner to formally file a lawsuit.</p>

<p>Although the local food market had seen rice prices temporarily fall due to Guangdong's exemption of taxes on foreign rice, recently, the central government has seriously reviewed the case, shortened the time frame, and stipulated that foreign rice taxes can be re-imposed at any time if domestic rice prices fall excessively. As a result, public confidence has been somewhat strengthened. In the past week alone, rice prices in the market have risen by as much as half a yuan. From this city alone, over ten thousand bags of客秈rice are transported to Guangzhou daily, and shipments to Guangdong from other places continue unabated.</p>

However, the section between the 日昇樓 and Henan Road West is relatively long and lacks stations, causing inconvenience for citizens. In view of this, the Municipal Council has recently announced the following new stops: (1) New Bus Stops: From east to west, a new stop will be added in front of 冠生園; from west to east, a new stop will be added at 虹廟. (2) New Tram Stops: From east to west, a new stop will be added at the Zhili Road intersection; from west to east, a new stop will be added in front of the Bank of Communications. The above-mentioned stop arrangements have been officially implemented, and those boarding and alighting at the new stops are quite crowded.</p>

<h3>A Young Woman with Limited Knowledge Was Deceived and Lost Her Virginity</h3>
<p>Zou Zhiyi, Originally from Shandong with a Wife, Opened a Store and Used Deceptive Means to Send Money Home; The Woman Discovered This and Filed a Lawsuit with the Court</p>
<p>Zhang Zhou, also known as Zhang Xiuhua, a 32-year-old local woman residing at No. 25 Huayuanfang on Rue du Pere Robert in the French Concession, has recently retained a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Second Branch of the Court, accusing Zou Zhiyi (34 years old, from Shandong), the owner of the Yihua Foreign Goods Store at No. 242 Huanlong Road and her lover, of fraudulent seduction, violating public morals, and deceiving her of property, as well as publicly insulting her. She has filed an incidental civil suit seeking compensation for damages. According to the complaint, the plaintiff went to the Beihengmao Customs Brokerage on Wuma Road in 1932. The defendant, who was the bookkeeper there, learned that the plaintiff was a young woman with some savings and discovered her whereabouts. He then pursued and seduced her, falsely claiming that he was not married and was willing to marry her and live with her until old age. The plaintiff, being naive, was deceived and lost her virginity. The defendant then took advantage of the situation, claiming that he had lived in Russia for many years and could speak Russian. He suggested opening a Russian daily necessities store in the French Concession, where many Russian expatriates lived, and claimed it would be profitable. The plaintiff believed him and provided a total of 2,000 yuan in cash and red sandalwood furniture. The defendant then opened the Yihua Jinghuo Store on Huanlong Road, which was doing fairly well. However, the defendant did not reciprocate the plaintiff's kindness but instead insulted, verbally abused, and physically assaulted her. The plaintiff, sensing something amiss, began to observe the defendant's actions and correspondence last month. She then discovered that the defendant had a wife at home and was constantly sending money from the store back to his hometown in Shandong for household expenses. Initially, he used deception to make the plaintiff believe they had a conjugal relationship and had sexual relations with her. Then, intending to unlawfully possess her property, he used deception to induce her to hand over her belongings. Finally, he used violence to publicly insult her. She requests that the defendant be prosecuted under Articles 229, 339, and 309, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. In the incidental civil suit, she seeks compensation for the fraudulently obtained sum of 1,000 yuan and the value of the red sandalwood furniture. The court, upon receiving the complaint, convened a hearing in the Second Criminal Court yesterday, presided over by Judge Chen Shuoying. The defendant failed to appear, nor was he represented by a lawyer. Only the plaintiff and her lawyer were present. After the facts were questioned in court, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant had failed to appear despite being summoned and requested that an arrest warrant be issued to bring the defendant to court for questioning. The court adjourned the hearing to a later date for further review.</p>

<h3>Pang Jubao Cannot Find His Wife</h3>
<p>Official Order to Investigate the Location and Arrest the Abductor</p>
<p>Pang Jubao, a 16-year-old owner of a shoe repair shop in front of Meimeili, Henghang Bridge, North Sichuan Road, has a wife named Xia Yueying, who is young. Chen Mingming, a fellow villager, often visited and had been having an affair with her for a long time. In January of this year, Chen falsely claimed that he would introduce Yueying to work at the Hengxing Silk Factory in Caojiadu, and tricked Pang out of one yuan for expenses. He then absconded with Yueying and hid at No. 9, Lane 256, Rue Belliot. Pang remained unaware of the situation for several days. When he went to look for his wife, she was nowhere to be found. He eventually found clues at Chen's cousin Chen Futang's place. The two Chens forced Pang to write a receipt acknowledging that he had received Yueying, before allowing him to take her home. On the 27th of last month, they abducted Yueying again. Pang filed a complaint with the District Court. When the defendants failed to appear, the prosecutor indicted them. Yesterday, Judge Bai opened the court. Pang's lawyer, Yu, stated that the defendants were hiding in Tiantai County. He requested that the court order an investigation of their location and the issuance of arrest warrants.</p>
<h3>Shen Jicheng and Wife Have Marital Discord</h3>
<p>Qi Shucheng Petitions for Separation</p>
<p>Shen Jicheng, 32, a former actor at Tianyi Film Company and currently a customs inspector stationed at Shanghai North Railway Station, is being sued for separation by his wife, Shen Qi Shucheng, 26 (from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 14, Bu Gao Li, Avenue Albert). Represented by lawyer Feng Song, she filed a petition with the Second Branch of the Civil Court, citing the following reasons: The two married in 1928 according to their parents' wishes and through a matchmaker at St. Peter's Church. Initially, their relationship was affectionate and they had four children: a daughter Meilin, 9 years old, a daughter Jinlin, 8 years old, a daughter Xiulin, 5 years old, and a daughter Huilin, 1 year old. However, the defendant, Shen Jicheng, has a fondness for women and has been engaging in illicit affairs outside the home. Since then, he has been mistreating the plaintiff and neglecting her livelihood. The plaintiff has been enduring this without complaint, hoping that he would realize his mistakes, repent, and return to her, so that their relationship could be as good as before. However, the defendant has not only failed to reform but has intensified his behavior. The plaintiff finds it unbearable to live with him and requests a separation for five years, ordering the defendant to pay 200 yuan per month for living expenses. The court, upon receiving the petition, convened a hearing yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Wang Shiqi. The defendant, Shen Jicheng, did not appear. The plaintiff's lawyer presented the reasons for the petition. The court noted the defendant's absence and ruled that the mediation was unsuccessful. The plaintiff was instructed to file a formal lawsuit before adjourning the hearing.</p>

<h3>Reading "Night-Shining Cup"</h3>
<p>— Chen Fu</p>
<p>In recent years, the lessons learned by ordinary Chinese people on national affairs can be described as profound and extensive. The fate of slaves is approaching us day by day; yet we cannot struggle free. Because resistance requires a long-term commitment, and internal stability must precede external resistance. As soon as you move, someone will come to "stabilize" you, stabilizing you until your flesh is torn apart, or until you become dazed and confused and end up in a dark cell.</p>
<p>There are many ways to save the nation; the pleasant-sounding names are too numerous to remember. But there are only two paths one can take, and ordinary people can see them clearly: to demand survival, one must fight; otherwise, one should resign oneself to being a slave to a conquered nation.</p>
<p>Although the misery of national subjugation is hard to imagine, the darkness in the Northeast and Eastern Hebei is a very good lesson. In these few years, we have shed countless blood, and these old and new bloodstains demonstrate the iron-willed determination of the Chinese people to survive. The enemy's aggression makes them angry, and the betrayal of the traitors makes them hate them. They are willing to use their lives to answer the aggressors and the shameless.</p>
<p>This is what we have seen in the various instances of inspiring and tragic historical facts!</p>
<p>Some time ago, a news item in the newspaper recorded the heroic drama of a woman who died for her country in Eastern Hebei. She was a dancer, but her patriotic enthusiasm led her to take on a heroic role. She ran to Eastern Hebei to assassinate Yin Rugeng, but unfortunately, her plan was leaked, and she was slaughtered. This dancer's enthusiasm has moved countless people, and it has recently been reflected in literature. Mr. You Jing's recent work, "Night-Shining Cup," is a five-act play based on this historical fact.</p>
<p>Naturally, such a patriotic action has a bit of a legendary character, and this martyred woman also carries a heroic color, as the author of "Night-Shining Cup" said, this kind of "near-nihilistic" tendency is not to be taken as a lesson. But what is valuable is her surging enthusiasm, and her righteous indignation!</p>
<p>The big shots are dissatisfied with the literary artists who "only talk about the illness, but do not prescribe a cure," while the special writers in Beiping, who live in an area of pollution and darkness, do not think it's wrong, but instead smell out a "heroin flavor" from the literature of national defense. "Night-Shining Cup" is an extremely excellent drama of national defense, although it does not "prescribe any medicine," it is worth reading by those who love literature. It is best to put it on the stage - because "Night-Shining Cup" not only writes about the heroism and enthusiasm of a woman, but also shines through the ugliness of the traitors, and the darkness and chaos under the puppet government!</p>

<h3>Ascetic Monk</h3>
<p>— Lu Jia</p>
<p>I once built a stone house halfway up the mountain in a small village, where I spent several leisurely winters and summers.</p>
<p>One early evening, as I was hovering on the edge of sleep, a mournful gong sound fell onto my pillow, waking me from my slumber.</p>
<p>I was familiar with this gong sound. Since I moved to the mountains, it had replaced the village watchman's clapper every night, from the early evening until the third watch. Tonight, this widow's weeping-like trembling sound waves once again followed the stone path up the mountain, gradually approaching my small window. Before the gong sound, there was also a loud and mournful chanting of Buddha's name:</p>
<p>Na—mo—A—mi—tuo—fo</p>
<p>The lingering sound rustled and trembled, eventually disappearing into the vast gong sound. As it drew closer, I could hear heavy footsteps mixed in with the gong and chanting.</p>
<p>The gong sound made the window paper and the leaves in front of the courtyard rustle.</p>
<p>I thought of the treacherous mountain paths, the straw sandals soaked by the cold dew, and the old ascetic monk who cried out his desperate Buddha's name. Was this old monk not afraid of the man-eating snakes on the mountain and the loneliness more terrifying than snakes?</p>
<p>I also remembered the legends about the old monk in the mountains: to atone for the great mistake he had made in his youth and to deliver the soul of a young girl, he abandoned his hair halfway, donned a kasaya, and according to the Buddhist rules for atonement, he walked up and down the mountain every night, bowing every few steps, turning several bends and twists, only returning to the temple by dawn. Every night, he lit a lantern to illuminate the dark path for the girl trapped in reincarnation; for the love he could not forget, he bravely walked this rugged mountain path. Regardless of the snow in the dead of winter, cloudy days, hurricanes, or sudden rainstorms... he walked this night road for nearly thirty years with firm steps, telling the mountain mists of the pain hidden deep in his heart through the gong and the chanting.</p>
<p>Because of this poignant story, I liked to abandon the warmth of the quilt in the middle of the night, push open the small window, and stick my head out into the cold wind, waiting for the floating gong sound.</p>
<p>I saw a glowing red lantern, like a fishing light on the night sea, gently swaying in the dim night. Along the mountain stone path, it would appear for a moment, then be hidden by the chaotic bushes and cliffs. As it gradually approached, the outline of an old monk appeared in the dim light of the red lantern. A gong hung in front of his chest, and he held a staff in one hand and prayer beads and a gong mallet in the other. The edges of his kasaya had been torn by thorns and were covered in mud, as if he had fallen and risen several times.</p>
<p>I could not clearly see his face, only see his white beard fluttering in front of his chest by the dim red light. He seemed to still have dignified features and a well-defined nose. Although a layer of melancholy covered his aging face, traces of his former elegance remained. His eyes radiated solemnity and perseverance, probing the rugged road ahead.</p>
<p>He walked with difficulty, and the kneeling every few steps prevented him from walking faster. Because this old monk was already too old, and the wind and rain had destroyed his body, he could hardly stand up without the help of a walking stick. But he still knelt down meticulously, murmuring unknowable mantras in his mouth, which, judging from his solemn attitude, must have been for the departed girl!</p>
<p>When he walked under my window, he looked very tired. Although struggling, his steps seemed disordered and frivolous. Each time he bowed, there was a danger of not being able to stand up. The sound of the gong and the chanting of Buddha's name also gradually weakened. I was deeply worried for him: could he endure this rugged mountain road? If he fell into the valley on such a late night, no one would come to save him.</p>
<p>The blurred figure and the dim lamp merged into the haze of the night again. I stood there blankly, a slight melancholy floating in my heart. I forgot that the night dew was heavy, and I had too thin a shirt on.</p>
<p>A mournful chanting of Buddha's name came from the top of the mountain, followed by the sound of the gong. The lingering sound slowly dissipated, gradually sinking into the silent night.</p>
<h3>National Essence</h3>
<p>— Wei Sheng</p>
<p>The explanation of "national essence" should undoubtedly be "the essence of the nation." However, what kind of things deserve to be called "the essence of the nation"? Needless to say, it is those things that help the nation survive and thus mark the nation's glory.</p>
<p>But no matter what country or nation it is, the need to survive is eternally不变, but the things that enable it to survive and develop are constantly changing. For example, firearms and cannons were once the "national essence" that helped our nation survive independently, but now, if we stubbornly cling to firearms and cannons and refuse to let go, then the day we lose "life" will be right in front of us. This simple truth is understood by anyone who is a little clear-headed, whether ancient or modern. Therefore, abandoning animal husbandry and engaging in farming is not the shame of "Hua Xia"; abolishing kneeling and adopting bowing, abolishing the imperial system and establishing a republic, not only cannot adopt the logic of "national essence" adherents, thinking it is a surrender of "worshiping foreigners," but it is also what every patriotic Chinese person should consider a manifestation of national glory and an immortal symbol of the Chinese national liberation movement. It can be seen that as long as it is something that can truly help us survive, we should accept it, and it is equally a pillar of national glory. There is no opposition between "foreign" or "local."</p>
<p>The problem does not lie in "local" or "foreign," but in "acquisition."</p>
<p>For example, roads: people use them to circulate their own industrial products, to regulate their own domestic markets, but we use them to help the dumping of imported goods. As a result, in other countries, they are used to express development, but in our country, they are used to express decline. It can be seen that to truly make "foreign" things beneficial to us, we must also have real power. For example, writing: the ancients progressed from pictograms to seal script and clerical script, and from seal script and clerical script to cursive and standard script, always seeking progress, but now our national essence proponents stubbornly cling to square characters. Writing materials: the ancients progressed from knives to pens, from bamboo slips to paper, always seeking progress, never begrudging abandoning old, useless things, but now our "national essence" adherents stubbornly cling to "one study and four treasures" and refuse to let go. As a result, everything that was glorious behavior in the ancients is now incompetence and vulgarity in us! It can be seen that to truly preserve the spirit of "national essence," it is not something that lazy worms who seek temporary ease can do.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the newspaper reported the following news: Zhou Houxu, the principal of Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou Middle School, and his younger brother, Zhou Houfu, seeing that young students are using fountain pens more and more widely, and their ability to write calligraphy with brushes is declining, and that foreign paper is being consumed more and more, have painstakingly researched and created "Huaiwen" stationery and writing ink paste. The stationery is an extremely exquisite small celluloid ivory box, containing pens, ink, inkstones, and water, the "four treasures of the study"... a powerful tool to preserve national essence and reclaim rights...</p>
<p>The two Mr. Zhous can see the "increasing consumption of foreign paper" and are concerned. Their concern leads them to think about "reclaiming rights," and this intention is admirable. However, the result of their "painstaking research" is not "national paper" as good as "foreign paper," or a "national fountain pen" as good as a "foreign fountain pen," but a new-style "four treasures of the study" packed in an "exquisite small celluloid ivory box." You have to mix ink, add water, dip the brush in ink, and write, it's still the same old routine: dirty and troublesome. Naturally, the result is certain: not only can it not "reclaim rights," but it cannot preserve "national essence." Trying to compromise by returning to the past results in a useless sacrifice for revival.</p>
<p>This is also a manifestation of being poisoned by the "national essence proponents" who are not "national essence."</p>
<h3>Starting Work</h3>

<h3>Research on the Ancestors of Mankind</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Ancient Skull of 250,000 Years Ago</p>
<p>At the end of March this year, the Academy of Biological Research in Philadelphia, USA, held an international discussion on ancient humans. On the closing day, Dr. Broom, Director of Vertebrate Paleontology and Anthropology at the Transvaal Museum in South Africa, presented an ancient animal skull to the audience. The skull was found last summer in a limestone cave in Sterkfontein, in the southwest corner of Transvaal. It is about 250,000 years old and can be considered the ancestor of mankind. It has a monkey-like brain, but its teeth are the same as those of humans. Because it is female, it is named "Sterkfontein Girl." According to reports, in 1934, an ancient organism was also found in the same cave 300 miles from Sterkfontein, named "Taung Child."</p>
<p>Continued on Page 5</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>According to Dr. Broom, these two ancient organisms have many similarities. Paleontologists have determined that the boy is a "truly missing link" in mankind, and some say that he is just a purebred chimpanzee. According to Professor Dart of South Africa, the boy was only five years old when he died, and his human component was greater than that of a human chimpanzee or chimpanzee, and was between apes and "Java Man." Dr. Broom agreed with this statement, but he believed that these two ancient organisms were not born in the same era. The boy was born in the "Lower Pleistocene" about 750,000 years ago, about the same era as "Java Man," while the girl was born in the "Middle Pleistocene" or "Upper Pleistocene" about 250,000 years ago. She was only eighteen years old, and her teeth were almost entirely human-like. She is closely related to a type inherited from the ancestors of mankind or "Upper Pliocene" humans one to two million years ago, and there is little doubt about this. Although European paleontologists have different opinions on the species to which the boy belongs, the latest discoveries and previous findings confirm that the "Taung Child" is indeed very similar to the ancestors of mankind. It was also found that the girl was probably killed by an extinct saber-toothed tiger, because next to the cave where she was found, there was a remains of a saber-toothed tiger, and the skull of the ape-man also had traces of saber-tooth marks. Many remains are often found in the Sterkfontein ape-man cave, which proves that the ape-men ate ostriches, rabbits, moles, crabs, and small antelopes. These things are now extinct. It can also prove that ape-men used tools to kill small antelopes and dig moles. When killing antelopes, they went in groups and surrounded the small antelopes in the water caves.</p>
<p>Dr. Broom also said: He believes that all evolution is developed under the control of "non-material great power"—which can also be said to be "spiritual great power"—and the purpose from the beginning was the appearance of mankind. When there were humans in the world, the great work was completed, and evolution ended. Dr. Broom believes that evolution has now stopped, and even ten million years from now, there will be no new living forms in the world. Evolution seems to have strived forward, and all major categories of mammals were created in the "Eocene" 40 million years ago. Since then, no new species of mammals have been created except for humans. About one million years ago, human-shaped animals suddenly appeared, as if a group of great powers were carrying out the mission of creating mankind and were working hard to evolve, but except for the successful one, all the others have failed and become extinct. Dr. Broom also explained that although his ideas will inevitably be opposed by religious people, biologist Huxley is writing a book to express this view."</p>
<p>Professor Hooton of Harvard University also expressed his opinion at the meeting: Humans do not rely on themselves for their own evolution, because there is a force in the human body, and that body will naturally fulfill its own destiny. Pre-human animals hung from trees and swayed, and later gradually felt that their bodies were too large to do this kind of childish game, so they went to the ground to find opportunities, and thus humans lived on the ground. Dr. Hooton also mentioned that the achievements of "fossil men" are far incomparable to modern savages. Modern savages rarely have any achievements worthy of anthropologists' attention. The first tools used by humans and the use of fire were discovered by "fossil men." "Fossil men" were probably also the creators of regular language. He broke away from apes and created human culture. Such great achievements have not been surpassed by later human undertakings.</p>
