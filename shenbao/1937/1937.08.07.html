<p>時評</p>
<h3>鼓勵民氣勿使消沉</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>日來華北戰局比較沉寂有人說。“這是暴風雨前的平靜”我們希望這話是對的。敵寇佔據了我們土地。一面在平津肆行屠殺。一面又以飛機四出擲彈示威。這種險惡恐怖的局面。豈是我們所能忍受。我們的文化古城與繁鬧港埠。豈能長留在敵人踐踏之下。所以目前華北戰局暫時沉寂。我們祗能望它是極暫時的。暫時的平靜應該迅速衝破。而衝破之後所展開的局面。則必然是我方的全力抗敵。驅逐敵人離境。</p>
<p>然而目前有一危險現象。卽戰局呈現沉寂之後。民氣漸見消沉這種趨向。有種種的因素。加以助成。我們不能不嚴加注意。這許多因素。最顯明者有下列的幾點。㊀有人談及目前的危局。常把我國形容為弱者。似乎不足與敵人抗衡。這種消極的論調。足以間接增强侵略者的氣燄。是非常危險的。㊁又有入談及我方抗戰不惜極度犧牲甚至大半國土糜爛亦為應有之事這種意見。一方面固可以表示我們决死奮鬥之意。另一面則也不免誇大敵人的破壞力。間接使我方軍民的抗敵意志。感受影響。㊂日來在京滬等地。有大部分居民遷移。此種現象。稱之為一種戰時的準備。固亦未始不可。但是過多而且過於急促的人口移動。足使謠諑四播。這時又加以敵人漢奸。乘機鼓動。使不明眞相的人民。未見抗敵而先自生擾動。結果於敵有利。而對於我國的抗敵準備。則反無何種帮助。</p>
<p>上述三點僅是幾個最易見的實例。我們從這種情形所得到的唯一敎訓。卽戰局沉寂的局面久延下去。足使民氣消沉而民氣的消沉。則已經不能為戰了然而在目前我們所容忍的最後關頭。早已超過不抗戰中國將無以自存而我們要戰卽應盡力維持並鼓勵民氣使勿消沉。</p>
<p>目前多數軍政要人之聚集首都為一種好現象。目前各地抗敵後援之積極布置亦為一種急要之工作這種種消息。用以對民衆宣傳。已足使羣心鼓舞此外若有更具體之事實。表示抗戰局面的確定展開。增强我國之勝利把握者。尤應迅速傳播使全國大衆均能堅毅沉着不畏懼任何牺牲在全面抗戰發動之後。我們必能以最大的勇气。博取最後的勝利。</p>
<h3>我們應如何抗敵救國</h3>
<p>—馮副委長廣播演講—　　　對敵人估計須正確　對抗敵政策須認淸發　揚民族抗戰精神　實行堅强持久戰爭</p>
<p>［南京］馮副委員長六日晚八時起、在中央廣播電台演講、題為“我們應如何抗敵救國”原詞如次、</p>
<p>諸位同胞、在今日我們的民族敵人日本帝國主義、又以武力攻佔我們的平津、屠殺我們的同胞、現在平漢鐵路、津浦鐵路、和平綏鐵路沿綫、到處轟炸我們的時候、眞正到了我們民族存亡的最後關頭、我看到聽到許多同胞、無有一個不是在憤怒敵人的暴行、都在打算如何為國家民族的存亡而奮鬥、我們看到犧牲自己的性命、抵抗敵人的進攻、雖然戰爭的結果、我們暫時小有失敗、可是這一切表現、已證明我們能够抗敵救國、並且保證我們能夠獲得抗戰的最後勝利、所以我今天就來和諸位談談“我們應如何抗敵救國”的問題、我們政府對於敵人的態度、已經蔣委員長幾次明白愷切地昭告於全世界、就是我們以平津及華北主權的不受侵犯、為我們暫時忍耐的最後關頭、所以現時除了日帝國主義澈底悔悟、返還一切侵佔去的領土主權以外、我們只有為爭取國家的生存而奮鬥、我們只有實現蔣委員長的主張而抗敵、說到如何抗敵救國、我們可以分三點來說第一、我們應如何正確的估計敵人這個問題、我們又可以分成二點、㊀六年來敵人不斷的對我國侵略、尤其是最近敵人在蘆溝橋和平津的襲擊轟炸、已經最後一次的打碎了少數人以為日帝國主義的侵略還有止境的幻想、另一方面這些慘痛的事實、又不免激起一部分同胞把全日本人民都看成敵人的錯誤認識、我們要知道侵略中國的是日本帝國主義、兇橫殘暴的是日本軍閥、至於日本人民、我相信大都還是愛好和平擁護公理和正義的、我相信他們終有一天會和我們携起手來、制裁他們橫行無忌的軍閥、打倒他們帝國主義的政治、但是我們對於日帝國主義和軍閥、却决不應該再存有絲毫的幻想他們是只有覆亡於我們革命戰爭的鐵血之下時、才能收拾他們貪得無厭的野心、才能認識世間的公理和正義、㊁我們還有些人把敵人的力量估計的太高、把我們自已的力量估計的太低、他們所以把敵人力量估得太高、一方面是太高估計了敵人砲火的效力、另一方面又相信日本可以在我國國民中用威脅利誘的卑劣手段、收買許多人去做工具關於現代戰爭中砲火的效力、我們在後面再去詳細說明、現在就以蘆溝橋的戰事而論、這是敵人處心積慮、至少計劃了一二個月以後的行動、為什麼他們攻擊了兩個星期、傷亡到由五百至三千人還沒有攻下、由此可見只要我們的將領和士兵能忠勇愛國不怕犧牲、相當的有點準備、就可以抵抗敵人武器的優勢、就可以打擊敵人外强中乾的輕舉妄動、同樣的我們平南戰爭的失敗、固然由於敵人武力的集中與衆多、然而亦於我們自己的準備不够、否則敵人是不會這樣容易得手的、又比如敵人早已把二十九軍和廿九軍的將領看成可以隨意支配的工具、然而宋哲元到了緊急的關頭、還是要不顧一切的還手、廿九軍的官兵、還是要忠義奮勇的抗戰起來、所以廿九軍這次幾千人的死亡、死的眞有價值、實不愧為申國的革命軍人、再如日本一手製造的冀東偽組織之下的保安隊、因為張慶餘和士兵的幡然反正、一天功夫就把通州的日本兵殺死了二百多而舉起抗敵的旗幟、由此可知敵人所製造所希望的我國內部的予盾、在民族生死關頭的時候、必然能够致的站在抗敵戰綫上共同挽救危亡、而日本所誇耀的武力、並非是不可戰勝的、况且現在有的不過是前哨的戰鬥、如果展開了全面的持久戰時、他們的內部問題、還要更多更大、㊂另方面又有些人把敵人的力量、估計的太低以為只要我們的軍隊一還擊敵人就得敗亡　這也是不合事實的想法、因為民族革命戰爭、固然不是單靠武器的優良、但是我們祇少得有决心、有計劃、有準備、我們要避免敵人之所長、以襲其所缺、益用我之所長、以攻其所短、因為敵人內部、固然有許多矛盾、士兵們都有畏縮怕死不願打仗的心理、但是亦必須在找們長久的抗戰與反攻之下、牠們內部問題和矛盾、才能完全暴露出來、總之、我們對於敵人的力量、估計的太高或太低、都是錯誤的、估計太高了、結論只有等待作亡國奴、或是甘心情願的做漢奸、估計太低了、不免要受許多不必要的失敗和損失、反而增加了敵人的兇燄、因此我們對於敵人的正確估計、應該是敵人的物質力量並不可怕、我們必能戰勝、而這個必能戰勝的條件、就是我們舉國上下堅毅的决心、週密具體的計劃、盡可能的充分準備和持久的大規模的抗戰、第二、我們應如何正確的認識抗敵政策、我們現在所以要實行抗戰、完全是我們的敵人逼迫出來的我們並不是愛好和平、正因為過去我們過於愛好和平、所以成為日本帝國主義侵略不己的對象、現在只有用抗戰手段、才能取得眞正的和平、才能使全世界的各民族獲得平等自由的生存發展之權利、因此我們的堅决抗戰、不是以一死了事、保全了個人的人格和國格、就以為足、而是以少數人民犧牲、求得全民訪無數人的永久生存、我們不是燬滅我們的民族和國家建設、使敵人卽使占領了全中國亦毫無所得、而是要在敵人的侵略中、把無論未被或已被敵人侵吞了的地方、用我們頑强抗戰的手段、完全把敵人驅逐出去、而取得國家自由與平等、我們這個最後勝利的信心、决不是幻想而是敎訓、總理中山先生曾分析武昌起義的事、說明這個道理、他說、有熊秉坤者、新軍中一排長耳、見事機已迫、正在大索黨人、若我不先發制人、終必為人所制、置於死地而後生、等死耳不如速發難、因將此意告諸同志、僉以無子彈對、後由熊秉坤向其友之已退伍者、借得兩盒子彈、分授同志、革命之武器所恃者、僅有此數、槍聲一起、砲兵營首先響應、瑞澂張彪相繼逃竄、武昌遂入於革命黨人之手、彼滿淸方面軍隊非不多也、槍彈非不備也、當革命風聲傳播之時、瑞澂日商諸某國領事、謂若湖北有事、請其撥軍艦相助、布置如此周密、共力如此雄厚、乃被革命黨人以兩盒子彈打破之、諸君試想兩盒子彈、至多不過五十顆卽使一一命中、殺敵不過五十人能打破武昌乎、余以為打破武昌者革命黨人之精神為之兵法云、先聲奪人、所謂先聲卽精神也準是以觀、物質之力量小、精神之力量大、可於武昌役决之、此第就本國而言、已有此先例、試再言外國、前次義大利人、有加利波地者、為一有名之革命家、彼亦非有如何武器能力、當其渡海攻城、也以一千人與三萬敵人相持四五日、卒由他路抄襲入城、此在戰略上戰術上、無論如何、均不能取勝、而事實之相懸若此、將謂以少勝衆手、直乃精神勝物質、這一段遺訓、是我們今日所當切記的、現在的日本帝國主義、其戰鬥力固遠勝於滿淸政府、但是我們現有的武器、亦遠勝於辛亥時的革命軍、况且我們有的是偉大的民族精神、而日本帝國主義、於如日俄戰爭時之俄國、毫無精神可言、所以這次中日戰爭的結果、只要我們澈底抗戰、失敗者必定是日本、最後勝利者必定是我國的、第三、我們應如何實行抗敵救國、從上面所說的看來、我們對於抗敵救國的辦法約有三點、㊀發揚我們民族抗戰精神、如同甲、毀家紓難的令尹子文為公不為私、乙、申包胥的為國不為家、我們首先要把許多不良的觀念、比如自私、不誠實、怕死、為家不為國、明哲保身、等等、這些觀念、如不剷除凈盡、不留一點奴隸坯子、我們現在應該刮垢磨光、以“為公”代替“自私”、以“忠實”代替“不誠、”以“犧牲”代替“怕死’以“戰死於戰塲”代替“壽終正寢、”我們如果個個人做到只知有公不知有私、忠於國忠於民族、不顧家庭、犧牲個人小我的生命、換取民族大我的生仔則我們的國家、必能從日本帝國主義的壓迫下、獲得自由平等的地位、比如土耳其和蘇聯的反抗戰爭、都是以民族抗戰精神而獲得勝利的最好榜樣、㊁我們要知道抗敵戰爭的進行、是．一個長時期的艱苦巨大的工作、我們除了貢獻我們的身體到戰塲上去奮鬥、還應該貢獻我們的金錢財產給國家、以充作一切必要的戰費、最近聽說侵略主義的日本、在蘆溝橋事變發生以後、他們的國民、尚有捐助一百萬元五十萬元給國家的、我們是被侵略的國家、我們是在生死存亡之最後關頭的人民、所以我們更應該比敵人還要加賠踴躍的來賢家紓難、人人將他所有的金錢、貢獻一大部分給國家、則我們自然不怕財政困難、不怕我們沒有新式的武器來抵抗敵人了、抗敵戰爭無疑的是個巨大的消耗戰、我們國民應該加倍的替抗戰生產用品、加倍的替抗戰節省、私人用品、實行不供給原料與敵人、而將節衣縮食和生產所得的物品、完全集中到國家手裏去、這樣我們的抗戰、就可以持久、力量就可以加大了、最近敵人已經在他們國內實行第七次的徵兵、並且增加戰費四五萬萬元、又宣傳要將二十八個師團來攻擊我國、民國四年的時候、日本曾以動員軍隊嚇住了袁世凱、使他完全承認了牠所提出的二十一條、同胞們現在已不是那個賣國政府時代了、我們要動員四萬萬五千萬人以答覆牠動員廿八個師團、我們要把精神把金錢把物力都貢獻給抗敵戰爭上去以拚死的戰鬥打擊我們的敵人、現在世界上還無所謂什麼眞理及和平、誰的力量大、眞理和平就在那一邊、現在是我們全體國民、為公理為正義為生存為和平為國家為民族為自已為子孫犧牲一切精神物質的最後關頭、要人人起來參加抗戰、方可生存、不然則亡、總理中山先生敎訓我們說、“安南有一個大官住在河內、呌做黃高啟、從前安南沒有亡國的時候、他做過了宰相的、所以他是升過了大官、發過了大財、因為他很有錢所以他置在河內的產業、便非常之多、家中的花園、也非常之火，但是安南現在亡了、他就是做過了大官、發過了大財還是要做法國的奴隸、國家亡了、要做外國人的奴隸、就是升官像黃高啟、發財也像黃高啟、要人不罵他是亡國奴、他還有什麼榮耀呢、國家之存亡、和我們人民有很大的關係、如果國家是强盛、大家便榮耀、國家是衰弱、大家便恥辱”、中山先生的這段遺訓、也就是我今天貢獻給諸位的意見、希望全國人民都在政府的統一領導之下、實行堅强持久的抗日民族革命戰爭、敵人是不足怕的、一次兩次的小失敗、也是不足慮的、只要我們全體國民愈接愈厲的抗戰下去、勝利總是我們的、(六日中央社電）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>對於上演“保衛蘆溝橋”的幾點意見</h3>
<p>— 羅才淸</p>
<p>“保衛蘆溝橋”到今天才能和我們在舞臺上相見，眞如前幾天李一先生所說的不免有“遲了”之感，但也正如保衛蘆溝橋一代序所說“我們有筆的時候用筆，有嘴的時候用嘴，到嘴筆都來不及用的時候，使各將以血肉和敵人相持於戰塲。我們不甘心做奴隸，我們願以鮮血向敵人保證我們民族的永存。”現在蘆溝橋雖然已失陷，—而且北平都吿淪亡了，但是，民族都有一顆鐵一樣堅強的心，將以血肉和敵人相持於戰塲，“蘆溝橋可為我人之墳墓”的吼聲將保證我們博得最後之勝利的。</p>
<p>現在所想說的是對於上演“保衛蘆溝橋”的幾點意見，中國劇作者協會的啟事：“本劇放棄上演權，歡迎國內外各劇團自由排演”。這是值得我們擁護的。“上起刺刀來，弟兄們散開！”（見“保衛蘆溝橋”第二部插曲“上起刺刀來”—獻給中華良國的軍人—）這不僅是中華民國軍人的大職，也將是全民業－致的打動，因為“中華民族是一個鐵的集體！我們不能失去寸土地！兵士戰死，有百姓來抵！丈夫戰死，有妻子來抵！“（見保衛蘆溝橋主題歌）但是了在幾個較大的都市，如上海，南京等，有多量的劇團組織外，其他窮鄉僻隅，甚至尙不知“話劇”是什麼東西。他們同樣是“鐵的集體”的一員，但是他們的嘴，他們的筆，是英雄無用武之地的，這責任應該由移動劇團負起來。我們要用鼓動的力量去喚醒，去聯繫各地的民衆，所以個人的私見：最好是由幾個小劇團聯合起來，各自分幕排演，如甲團担任第一幕，乙團担任第二幕等。事前預定了出發地點的路綫，分組前往，譬如甲團在某地演了第一幕，馬上向第二個目的地出發，而由乙團補上來接演第二幕……這樣，人數可以减少，行動上佔到不少便利，而且可以很快的深入到內地去。而且可以操用“放下你的鞭子”的演出方式，即是曠塲上，街頭巷尾，張一幕布作為房屋，豎一竹竿代門墻，都可演出。我們不必研究演技，祇要能夠表達劇中的情緒去刺激觀衆，鼓動觀衆就夠了。據說南京此次上演“蘆溝橋”，田漢先生發表過這層意見。</p>
<p>至於各地能自動組織劇團，自然更好。上面已經說過，在演出方面可以儘量簡單，寗願節省無謂的消耗，而多演幾塲。而且各地自動組織的劇團，不妨用方言演出。我國言語不流一，用國語演出，在許多地方反有隔膜之弊，方言演出，不但可以把演者的情緒完全發揮，而聽者也感到格外親切，這在收效上比較有把握。</p>
<p>此次上海公演的“保衛蘆溝橋”，因為租界的特殊關係，祇能假座南市蓬萊大戲院，這是我們感到痛心的，但是也應該利用移動劇團之長，不妨用最簡單的形式出發到曹家渡，浦東一帶去上演，這不但是對於中國劇團聯誼社的希望，其他小劇團也是責任所在。至於此次的演期，據說只有四天，而且售座最高價為一元，這顯得太不普遍。演期如此短促，或許是工作者的時間關係，但是我們不妨擴大范圍，集中所有人才，誰有空就由誰上演，不必限定這幾個人，這樣可以延長演期。座價高至一元，這或者是戲院租費或其他開支過鉅的關係，但以後可以特演幾塲戲，减低座價，能售一角，五分最好。這是個人的一點私見。</p>
<p>這私見也就是“代序”上所說的希望這個劇本能夠廣泛的上演於前後方，更希望看過戲的觀衆，能和我們—劇中所有的民衆士官們相共鳴，高呼：</p>
<p>保衛蘆溝橋！保衛華北！保衛祖國！一切不願做奴隸的人們，起來呀！</p>
<p>報告文學</p>
<h3>陽光下</h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>華北被魔鬼的蹄爪蹂躪着。戰鼓響了，終于暴風雨波動了整個的中華。但是我們的華南民衆，雖然一部份已經覺醒了，其他的都還迷濛在黑暗的角落里，過着和日常同樣的生活。這種環境之下的我們青年，却像一座火山似的，隨時要想從地殼中爆裂出來。我們决不拋忘了所負着偉大的使命！</p>
<p>然而，我們主要的任務，並不是現在急于要掮了槍支去赴戰，而是要使民衆們知道這次華北的事件，誰是禍首，誰是殺人的正兇。因此，我們這一羣靑年，在合唱着“起來，不願做奴隸的人們……冒着敵人的炮火，前進！”的歌聲中，抱着興奮熱烈的心情，走向每一個平民窟裏去了。</p>
<p>出發宣傳的第一天下午。——</p>
<p>那是－個陽光猛烈的天氣。天上沒有一朵流雲，風也停滯着。這平民窟，彷彿一隻被烙紅了的鐵鍋似的，到處充滿了熱浪。我們沿着這迂曲的小路走去，經了半點鐘的折磨，終于，在一塊被垃圾堆成了墳丘，污水流成了小溪的曠塲上收住了腳步。——這曠塲的前面却有着百來間鴿籠似的矮屋。</p>
<p>臭，熱，渴，這時已三位一體的交織着我們每個人身體。但是我們不因此放鬆了目前的地位，把一切準備起來了。</p>
<p>兩旁此刻却已有好些人圍住了我們：尤其是一羣小孩子，像看什麼把戲似的，拚命扯動着肩膀，舉起了腿子，從人羣中擠進一張張粗髒的臉來，怪聲兒地嚷着:</p>
<p>“學生哥兒來演說了，媽媽！來聽……”</p>
<p>“快來瞧啊！…………”</p>
<p>大人們呢，也興奮得像螞蟻子獲着了狼藉的魚骨似的，漸漸地各人丟開了自己手中的工作，也將我們四個人包圍在垓心。</p>
<p>人不斷地增多着，他們先是交頭接耳的起着紛論。接着，是對我們露出了歡迎的笑臉；更有二三們人，我親眼瞧見他們在爭奪着一張破爛的板櫈，要讓我們可以安定的坐下。</p>
<p>“先生，你們講啊！”</p>
<p>喧嚷煩雜的語聲鬧了一陣子，頃刻間，却回過來一種異常嚴肅的情緒。于是我們一個伙伴開始講下去了：</p>
<p>“兄弟，叔伯們！我們的天津，北平現在已經給強人奪了過去，他們到處殺人，放火，那邊的民房已多半數被搗完了！……雖然，士兵們正在火綫上拚着生命，但他們用飛機大砲向我們轟炸，在蘆溝橋，長辛店已不知死傷了多少同胞。——我們在後方，現在可也不能忍耐的，我們應該準備起來，拿我們的拳頭當做武器，去打……”</p>
<p>“打死××人！我們要打啊！——”</p>
<p>突然的，他那激昂的聲喉在這時被四圍的人聲冲散了！人叢中却有不少數的眼睛浴着血：憤然地或是舉起了粗大的手臂。每個人的臉上掛着黃荳那麽大的汗珠……</p>
<p>然而我們為了防范警署加给我們“擾乱治安”的罪名，忙着站起身來，拉高了嗓子喊着：</p>
<p>“不許你們嚷，大家靜聽下去啊！”</p>
<p>嘶啞了我們的喉嚨，才壓住了他們的吼聲。接着我們的伙伴又說下去道：</p>
<p>“你們放心！咱們現在已經出了大兵，上前方去應戰了！……但是，當北方正危急的時候，你們在後方千萬不可聽受歹人的誘惑，去當漢奸，給我們自已受重大的打擊！——”</p>
<h3>保衛蘆溝橋㊁</h3>
<p>— 陳禾作</p>
<p>蘆溝橋頭的一家小茶館里，這時候有一個獨腳退伍兵士呌做劉得標的在那裏唱“失地鼓詞”。詞曰：</p>
<p>“失地一方又一方，吉林遮寗黑龍江：熱河之後再是河北察哈爾，一天一天侵略儘猖狂。</p>
<p>譬如破竹沒抵抗，敵人更把野心橫：自古道水來土堰兵來將擋，怎能强盜臨鬥沒主張？”</p>
<p>老劉的鼓詞博得大家的贊賞，並且還有人要求“再來一個”但是老劉說：“咱是個老粗，本不會唱什麼詞兒，這還是以前在隊伍裏面學來的。”</p>
<p>於是他談起咅峯口，在那裏他們二十九軍的大刀會留下點威風，老劉的一條腿也換了鬼子的一輛坦克車，幾十條性命……</p>
<p>有一個呌丁大頭就問他：“大刀隊旣然那麼威風，怎樣沒把鬼子殺光呢”？</p>
<p>老劉說：“那咱可不知道，上頭呌咱們弟兄退呀”</p>
<p>“狗臊的甘心去當漢奸！”</p>
<p>“漢奸也是我們的敵人啊！……”</p>
<p>“照哇！”我們四個人却禁不住對那幾個倔強的同胞鼓了一陣嘹響的掌聲。他們呢，也得意地笑了一笑，繼續的聽着我們的勸告。——</p>
<p>“……我們知道：一般人的去當漢奸，是為了自己的生活。他們窮了，自然也愛去幹一下子的，其實這是錯誤！你們要互相的防備，誰發覺誰人的行為有這種嫌疑，立刻去報告就地警所，那也是非常偉大的功績啊！………”</p>
<p>“好的！我們準照這辦法實行：然而，××人欺悔我們太利害了，我們要求將他們趕出華北………你看見了大人們，煩你代替我們小百科這樣帶個信兒————”</p>
<p>那個個子高高的年青人興奮地說着這大套話，我們幾平被感動得流淚了；我們也幾乎忘記了這時是站在猛烈的陽光下，受著熱浪的熏炙………</p>
<p>這樣過了約摸一個鐘頭，我們為要將這些灌輸到更廣大的市民層里，于是，我們但離開了這烈陽照射的地帶。</p>
<p>在臨走時，他們這大堆人還向我們高高的招着手，痛快地喊出了一聲：</p>
<p>“先生們，再会！——”</p>
<h3>“如何如何”</h3>
<p>— 长靑</p>
<p>少时，讀三國演義，當諸葛亮授計給將屬的時候，作者卽用“如此如此”“這般這般”，將調兵遣將的計策輕輕提過不表。這辦法，倒不是有關“軍事秘密”，而是作者為使文章有波瀾的一種埋伏法而已。事實上諸葛亮當初一定給諸將屬說明了出兵的計劃的。</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>四日的各報上，在“政府同僚意見完全一致”的標題登出了一則新聞：</p>
<p>“南京三日電”中央社訊：軍政部發言人談：自蘆溝橋事件發生以來，我政府本既定政策，審慎肆應，全國意見完全一致，政府同僚更無不同主張，外報所傳何應欽等主張如何如何，絶對不確，想係傳聞失實。</p>
<p>這便是於“如此”“這般”以外，又有“如何”的一格。而所以有此“如何”的一格，大概不是漢奸的陰謀，便是敵人的造謡。因爲中央自蘆溝橋事件發生以來文章已不再用埋伏法，早已宣佈了最低限度的四點立場，和已抱於最後關頭，必須犧牲到底的决心。中央國策，“如此這般”早已家諭户曉，孩提皆知。若又欲從“如此這般”中，打出一條“如何”的道路，非漢奸與敵人的陰謀而何。</p>
<p>敵人與漢奸，要在我們“如此這般”的國策中，打出“如何”的道路。雖然没有把握，但遲遲不行的川越茂，終於由大連飛來到上海了。言外之音，是很可玩味的。其言曰，“彼力雖微，仍冀中日關係於最後的危機線上可以轉換，盡力調整國交，惟大勢所趨，或恐不能，果爾則後事只可付諸年青者。”既用“調整國交”來開闢“如何”的道路，又用“付諸年青者”，來威嚇我們既定的“這般”的國策，眞是個絶好的外交官詞令。而東京中央社的電訊，；於其後又加上一句：“此間對川越此行，期待甚大。”彷彿傳出敵人眞的没有土地野心似的。眞的還有條“如何”的道路可以開闢似的。這眞呌人有“如之何！如之何！”之歎了</p>

<h3>Sudden Tension in Hankou as Storm Brews</h3>
<p>Japanese Concession Declares Martial Law, Japanese Marines Land and Deploy Defenses; Consulates of Various Countries Prepare for Emergencies; Our Authorities Remain Calm, No Incidents Occur Until Late</p>
<p>[Hankou] The Japanese Concession suddenly declared martial law on the evening of the 5th. At approximately 11:00 PM, Japanese Marines landed and rushed to construct defensive works, working busily throughout the night. The situation was tense. Fortunately, our side remained calm and no incidents occurred. Upon inquiry by our authorities today, they claimed there had been a misunderstanding. By 5:00 PM this afternoon, the situation had eased. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hankou] This afternoon, Japanese sailors on patrol in the Japanese Concession reinforced the sandbag defenses already built on various roads leading to the Chinese territory. Armored cars carrying numerous Japanese soldiers patrolled the roads and guarded key points, immediately creating a tense situation. Chinese soldiers were also stationed behind newly constructed sandbag defenses in the Chinese territory and at the concrete defenses built near intersections adjacent to the Japanese Concession. Meanwhile, the last group of approximately 400 women and children of Japanese residents were scheduled to sail to Shanghai tomorrow afternoon. Foreign residents in and near the Japanese Concession received warnings to evacuate immediately. Chinese people also flocked into the Chinese Special District. Consulates of various countries prepared for emergencies, having selected assembly points for their respective nationals. However, no incidents have occurred yet. Between 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM last night, Japanese soldiers in the Japanese Concession conducted defense drills, with all lights extinguished, causing widespread panic. Chinese officers guarding the nearby Special District, unaware of the reason, immediately dispatched additional soldiers to guard the defenses and took other precautionary measures. Residents in the vicinity were alarmed for an hour until everything returned to normal around midnight. It is reported that the Japanese authorities had notified the Chinese authorities in advance about the drills, but due to miscommunication, this information was not relayed to the Special District. A reporter from the English-language Chu Pao interviewed the Japanese Consul General, who stated that the Japanese Commander-in-Chief had recently met with He Chengjun, the Pacification Director. Both parties stated that they had no intention of attacking the other. The Japanese army is now under orders from Tokyo to abide by the Cabinet's decision and not provoke any incidents. When the reporter asked if the Japanese army would defend the Japanese Concession if the Chinese army attempted to occupy it, the Japanese Consul General replied that, of course, they would defend it, and that there was no doubt about it. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 6th)</p>

Whether or not to reorganize the 19th Route Army will be up to the government. All the soldiers of the 19th Route Army want to find a chance to sacrifice themselves and shed the last drop of blood for the country. If Japan can give up its aggression and return our lost territories, then the battle clouds in the sky can disappear immediately. Otherwise, our country should not shy away from a war. As for the future of the war, we do not need to consider it at present, nor do we have time to consider it. However, the situation where the people of our country are determined to sacrifice to the end and the Japanese warlords are forcing their people to make unjust sacrifices will inevitably lead to a tragic end for the aggressors. Upon arriving in Nanjing, I will visit Chiang Kai-shek. Zou said that this war of resistance is not only related to the survival and continuation of our country and nation, but also to the survival of the world's human culture. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Encourage National Spirit, Do Not Let It Decline</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Recently, the war situation in North China has been relatively calm. Some say, "This is the calm before the storm." We hope this is true. The enemy has occupied our land and is carrying out massacres in Tianjin and Peking while also using aircraft to demonstrate by dropping bombs. This dangerous and terrifying situation is unbearable for us. How can our ancient cultural cities and bustling ports remain under the enemy's trampling feet for long? Therefore, the current temporary calm in the North China war situation can only be hoped to be extremely temporary. This temporary calm should be quickly broken, and the situation that unfolds afterward must be our full-scale resistance against the enemy, driving them out of our territory.</p>
<p>However, there is a dangerous phenomenon currently: after the war situation has become calm, the national spirit is gradually declining. Various factors are contributing to this trend, and we must pay close attention to it. Among these factors, the most obvious are the following points: ㊀ When people discuss the current crisis, they often describe our country as weak, seemingly unable to resist the enemy. This kind of negative argument can indirectly enhance the arrogance of the aggressors and is very dangerous. ㊁ Others talk about our resistance, saying that even if it entails extreme sacrifice, even the devastation of a large part of our territory is acceptable. While this can express our determination to fight to the death on the one hand, on the other, it inevitably exaggerates the enemy's destructive power, indirectly affecting the will of our soldiers and civilians to resist the enemy. ㊂ Recently, in cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai, a large number of residents have relocated. This phenomenon, called a wartime preparation, may not be entirely wrong. However, excessive and rushed population movements can spread rumors everywhere. At this time, the enemy and traitors take the opportunity to stir up trouble, causing people who do not know the truth to become agitated before even resisting the enemy. As a result, this benefits the enemy and does not help our country's preparations for resistance.</p>
<p>The above three points are just a few of the most easily seen examples. The only lesson we learn from this situation is that if the calm war situation is prolonged, it will weaken the national spirit, and once the national spirit is weakened, there can be no more fighting. However, at this last juncture we are tolerating, it has long been exceeded: if China does not resist, it will not be able to survive. And if we want to fight, we should do our best to maintain and encourage the national spirit, so that it does not decline.</p>
<p>The current gathering of most military and political leaders in the capital is a good sign. The active deployment of anti-Japanese support in various places is also an urgent task. These messages, used to publicize to the masses, are enough to inspire everyone. In addition, if there are more concrete facts indicating the definite unfolding of the war against Japan, enhancing our country's grasp of victory, they should be quickly disseminated so that the entire nation can be firm and calm, not afraid of any sacrifice. After the full-scale war of resistance is launched, we will surely be able to gain the final victory with the greatest courage.</p>
<h3>How Should We Resist the Enemy and Save the Nation?</h3>
<p>—Vice Chairman Feng's Broadcast Address— Accurate Estimation of the Enemy Required. Clear Understanding of Anti-Japanese Policies Required. Promote the National Spirit of Resistance. Implement a Strong and Protracted War.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Vice Chairman Feng delivered a speech on the Central Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 6th, starting at 8 PM, entitled "How Should We Resist the Enemy and Save the Nation?" The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, today, our national enemy, Japanese imperialism, has once again occupied our Tianjin and Peking with military force, massacring our compatriots. Now, along the Pinghan Railway, Jinpu Railway, and PingSui Railway, they are bombing everywhere. It has truly reached the final moment of our nation's survival. I have seen and heard that none of our compatriots are not angered by the enemy's atrocities, and all are considering how to fight for the survival of the nation. We see them sacrificing their lives to resist the enemy's attack. Although the result of the war is that we have temporarily suffered small defeats, all these performances have proved that we can resist the enemy and save the country, and guarantee that we can achieve the final victory of the War of Resistance. Therefore, today I am here to talk to you about the question of "How Should We Resist the Enemy and Save the Nation?" Our government's attitude towards the enemy has been clearly and thoroughly announced to the world by Chairman Chiang several times, that is, we take the inviolability of the sovereignty of Tianjin and Peking and North China as the final juncture of our temporary endurance. Therefore, now, unless Japanese imperialism thoroughly repents and returns all the territories and sovereignty it has seized, we can only fight for the survival of the country, and we can only realize Chairman Chiang's proposition to resist the enemy. Speaking of how to resist the enemy and save the country, we can divide it into three points. First, how should we correctly estimate the enemy? We can divide this into two points. ㊀ For six years, the enemy has been constantly invading our country, especially the recent attacks and bombings by the enemy at Lugouqiao and Tianjin, which have finally shattered the illusion of a few people that Japanese imperialism's aggression still has a limit. On the other hand, these tragic facts inevitably arouse some compatriots to mistakenly regard all Japanese people as enemies. We must know that it is Japanese imperialism that is invading China, and it is the Japanese warlords who are fierce and brutal. As for the Japanese people, I believe that most of them still love peace and uphold justice and righteousness. I believe that one day they will join hands with us to punish their rampant warlords and overthrow their imperialist politics. However, we should never have any illusions about Japanese imperialism and the warlords. Only when they are destroyed under the iron and blood of our revolutionary war can they rein in their insatiable ambitions and recognize the justice and righteousness of the world. ㊁ Some of us also overestimate the enemy's strength and underestimate our own strength. The reason why they overestimate the enemy's strength is, on the one hand, that they overestimate the effectiveness of the enemy's artillery, and on the other hand, they believe that Japan can use despicable means of threats and inducements to buy many people among our people to become tools. Regarding the effectiveness of artillery in modern warfare, we will explain it in detail later. Now, taking the war in Lugouqiao as an example, this was an action that the enemy had deliberately planned for at least one or two months. Why have they not captured it after attacking for two weeks and suffering casualties ranging from five hundred to three thousand people? From this, it can be seen that as long as our generals and soldiers are loyal, brave, patriotic, and not afraid of sacrifice, and are reasonably prepared, they can resist the enemy's superior weapons and strike at the enemy's pretentious and reckless actions. Similarly, the failure of our Pingnan War was due to the enemy's concentration of forces and numbers, but also to our own insufficient preparation. Otherwise, the enemy would not have succeeded so easily. For example, the enemy had long regarded the generals of the 29th Army as tools that could be disposed of at will. However, when Song Zheyuan reached a critical juncture, he had to fight back regardless of everything. The officers and soldiers of the 29th Army had to be loyal, brave, and fight hard. Therefore, the deaths of thousands of people in the 29th Army this time were truly valuable. They deserve to be revolutionary soldiers of the Shen Kingdom. Furthermore, the security team under the puppet organization of eastern Hebei, which was created by Japan, killed more than 200 Japanese soldiers in Tongzhou and raised the banner of resisting the enemy in one day because of Zhang Qingyu and the soldiers' sudden turn to righteousness. From this, it can be seen that the internal contradictions in our country created and hoped for by the enemy will inevitably stand on the anti-Japanese front together to save the crisis at the critical moment of national life and death. The martial power boasted by Japan is not invincible. Moreover, what we have now is only the outpost battle. If a full-scale protracted war is launched, their internal problems will be even more and bigger. ㊂ On the other hand, some people underestimate the enemy's strength, thinking that as long as our army fights back, the enemy will be defeated. This is also an unrealistic idea, because the national revolutionary war is not simply about the excellence of weapons, but we must at least have determination, planning, and preparation. We must avoid the enemy's strengths, attack their weaknesses, and use our strengths to attack their weaknesses. Because there are many contradictions within the enemy, and the soldiers all have the psychology of shrinking back, fearing death, and not wanting to fight, but these internal problems and contradictions can only be fully exposed under our long-term war of resistance and counterattack. In short, it is wrong to overestimate or underestimate the enemy's strength. If you overestimate it, the conclusion is only to wait to be a slave to the country, or to willingly be a traitor. If you underestimate it, you will inevitably suffer many unnecessary failures and losses, which will only increase the enemy's arrogance. Therefore, our correct estimation of the enemy should be that the enemy's material power is not terrible, and we will surely be able to defeat it. The condition for this inevitable victory is our nation's firm determination, detailed and concrete plans, the fullest possible preparation, and a sustained and large-scale war of resistance. Second, how should we correctly understand the policy of resisting the enemy? The reason why we are now implementing the War of Resistance is entirely forced upon us by our enemy. We do not love peace, precisely because we loved peace too much in the past, so we became the object of Japanese imperialism's relentless aggression. Now, only by means of resistance can we achieve true peace and enable all nations of the world to gain the rights to equal and free survival and development. Therefore, our resolute resistance is not to die and be done with it, preserving one's personal integrity and national integrity, and thinking that is enough, but to seek the permanent survival of countless people by sacrificing a few people. We are not destroying our nation and national construction, so that even if the enemy occupies all of China, they will gain nothing, but in the enemy's invasion, we will completely drive the enemy out by means of our tenacious resistance, whether in places that have not been or have already been invaded by the enemy, and achieve national freedom and equality. Our confidence in this final victory is by no means an illusion, but a lesson. President Sun Zhongshan once analyzed the Wuchang Uprising, explaining this principle. He said, "There was a Xiong Bingkun, a platoon leader in the New Army. Seeing that the opportunity was pressing and the party members were being searched, if I did not strike first, I would be controlled and put to death. It is better to strike quickly rather than wait for death. He told his comrades this idea, but they all said they had no bullets. Later, Xiong Bingkun borrowed two boxes of bullets from a retired friend, and distributed them to his comrades. The revolutionary weapons relied on only this number. As soon as the gunshots started, the artillery battalion responded first, and Rui Cheng and Zhang Biao fled one after another, and Wuchang fell into the hands of the revolutionaries. The Qing side had many troops, and they were fully equipped with ammunition. When news of the revolution spread, Rui Cheng discussed it with a consul of a certain country, saying that if something happened in Hubei, he would ask them to send warships to help. The arrangements were so meticulous, and the joint forces were so strong, but they were broken by the revolutionaries with two boxes of bullets. Think about it, two boxes of bullets, at most fifty bullets. Even if they all hit, they could only kill fifty enemies. How could they break Wuchang? I think what broke Wuchang was the spirit of the revolutionaries. The art of war says, 'Seize the initiative by making a noise.' The so-called 'noise' is the spirit. Based on this, the power of material is small, and the power of spirit is great. This can be decided in the Wuchang campaign." This is just based on our own country, and there is already this precedent. Let me talk about a foreign country. Previously, an Italian, named Garibaldi, was a famous revolutionary. He did not have any weapons or abilities. When he crossed the sea to attack the city, he held out against 30,000 enemies with 1,000 men for four or five days, and finally attacked the city from another path. Whether in strategy or tactics, he could not have won, but the facts were so different. What do you mean by winning with less against more? It is directly the spirit winning over material." This passage of instruction is what we should remember today. Today's Japanese imperialism, its fighting power is far better than the Qing government, but our existing weapons are also far better than the revolutionary army in the Xinhai Revolution. Moreover, we have a great national spirit, while Japanese imperialism is like Russia during the Russo-Japanese War, with no spirit to speak of. Therefore, the result of this Sino-Japanese war is that as long as we thoroughly resist, the loser must be Japan, and the final victor must be our country. Third, how should we implement the War of Resistance and save the country? Judging from what has been said above, we have about three points regarding how to resist the enemy and save the country: ㊀ Promote our national spirit of resistance, such as A, Yin Ziwu who ruined his family to help the country, being public and not private, and B, Shen Baoxu's being loyal to the country and not to his family. First of all, we must get rid of many bad ideas, such as selfishness, dishonesty, fear of death, loyalty to the family but not to the country, and self-preservation. If these concepts are not completely eradicated, leaving no trace of slavery, we should now scrape off the dirt and polish it up, replace "selfishness" with "public," replace "dishonesty" with "honesty," replace "fear of death" with "sacrifice," and replace "dying peacefully in bed" with "dying in battle." If everyone can only know the public and not the private, be loyal to the country and the nation, disregard the family, and sacrifice the lives of the small self to exchange for the lives of the great national self, then our country will surely be able to obtain a free and equal position from the oppression of Japanese imperialism. For example, the resistance wars of Turkey and the Soviet Union are the best examples of achieving victory through the national spirit of resistance. ㊁ We must know that the conduct of the War of Resistance is a long-term, arduous, and huge task. In addition to contributing our bodies to fight on the battlefield, we should also contribute our money and property to the country to be used as all necessary war expenses. Recently, I heard that after the Lugouqiao Incident, the citizens of Japan, which is an aggressor, donated 1 million yuan and 500,000 yuan to the country. We are the invaded country, and we are the people at the last juncture of life and death. Therefore, we should be even more eager to help the country than the enemy. Everyone should contribute a large part of all the money they have to the country, so that we will naturally not be afraid of financial difficulties, and we will not be afraid that we will not have new weapons to resist the enemy. The War of Resistance is undoubtedly a huge war of attrition. Our people should redouble their efforts to produce supplies for the War of Resistance, redouble their efforts to save for the War of Resistance, and not supply raw materials and private supplies to the enemy, but completely concentrate the goods obtained from austerity and production into the hands of the country. In this way, our War of Resistance can be sustained, and our strength can be increased. Recently, the enemy has already implemented the seventh conscription in their country and increased war expenses by 450 million yuan, and also announced that they will send 28 divisions to attack our country. In 1915, Japan once intimidated Yuan Shikai by mobilizing troops, causing him to completely recognize the Twenty-One Demands it proposed. Compatriots, now is not the era of that traitorous government. We must mobilize 450 million people to respond to their mobilization of 28 divisions. We must contribute our spirit, money, and material resources to the War of Resistance to strike at our enemies with a desperate fight. There is no so-called truth and peace in the world now. Whoever has the greatest strength, truth and peace are on that side. Now is the final moment for all of us to sacrifice all our spiritual and material things for justice, for survival, for peace, for the country, for the nation, for ourselves, and for our children and grandchildren. Everyone must rise up and participate in the War of Resistance in order to survive, otherwise they will perish. President Sun Zhongshan taught us, "There was a high official in Annam who lived in Hanoi, named Huang Gaoqi. Before Annam was conquered, he had served as prime minister, so he had been promoted to high office and made a lot of money. Because he was very rich, he had a lot of property in Hanoi, and the garden in his house was also very beautiful. But now that Annam is conquered, even if he had been a high official and made a lot of money, he would still be a slave to France. If the country is conquered, he would be a slave to foreigners. Even if he had been promoted to high office like Huang Gaoqi and made a lot of money like Huang Gaoqi, what honor would he have if people did not scold him as a slave to the conquered country? The survival of the country has a great relationship with our people. If the country is strong, everyone will be honored. If the country is weak, everyone will be ashamed." This passage of instruction from President Sun Zhongshan is also the opinion I am contributing to you today. I hope that all the people of the country will, under the unified leadership of the government, implement a strong and sustained anti-Japanese national revolutionary war. The enemy is not to be feared, and small failures once or twice are not to be worried about. As long as all of us continue to resist more and more fiercely, victory will always be ours.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi and Gu Weijun Meet with French Prime Minister Xu Dan</h3>
<p>Kong says China is ready to fight for survival. Gu says Japan's actions are completing the Tanaka Plan.</p>
<p>[Paris] Chinese Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, accompanied by Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, visited French Prime Minister Xu Dan today to discuss the Far Eastern situation. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, arrived here this morning from London and will stay until the 7th of this month before proceeding to Berlin and Prague. He told reporters from Havas that regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, "If the countries of Western Europe want to prevent war in the Far East, they may still be able to do so. Most of the public opinion in Europe and the United States is sympathetic to China, and I am very pleased. I also firmly believe that if the rulers and people of Japan can accept world opinion, its influence will not only save China and Japan from war, but also save the countries of the world from catastrophe. China is now defending its independence and is determined to repay violence with violence. The current stalemate is obviously a struggle between aggressive war and the forces of peace. China will not only fight for its own survival, but also for world justice and righteousness." Regarding the withdrawal of the 29th Army of China from Beiping and Tianjin, Vice President Kong said that rumors in Western countries that General Song Zheyuan had betrayed the country were untrue. In fact, Mr. Song trusted the Japanese garrison authorities too much. The Japanese army had made solemn promises, and Mr. Song believed them without doubt, only to be deceived by Japan. Vice President Kong's visit to France is not of an official nature, but he began negotiations on various economic and financial issues with financial circles in Paris before going to the United States last month. Negotiations will continue within days to seek solutions. In addition, Mr. Kong will defend China's position in the Sino-Japanese dispute. (Havas, Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Chinese Ambassador to France Dr. Gu Weijun recently told reporters from "Strong Newspaper" that "Japan's current actions are a step to complete the Tanaka Plan. Japan has long coveted mineral resources and farmland in North China, but the cooperation of a nation can never be achieved by bayonets. In particular, economic cooperation cannot be achieved by force. At this point, a serious conflict between China and Japan is inevitable. After the start of the war, we will continue to resist until the last breath. As for the outcome of the conflict, there are only two possibilities: either peace-loving and respected countries will come forward to intervene strongly, or the aggressor country will go bankrupt financially and economically. It is true that the countries of the world have their own serious difficulties, but acts of military aggression, no matter where they come from, directly endanger international peace and the security of all nations. This is also something we must not forget." Ambassador Gu Weijun then explained the causes of the current Sino-Japanese conflict, saying that Japan claimed it wanted to enter Wanping County to search for missing Japanese soldiers, but was refused by the Chinese defense forces, so it opened fire on the city. An attack. An exercise of the Japanese army in the area of Wanping City violated the Xin Chou Treaty which clearly prohibited it. This was the first step in Japan's provocation. A few weeks ago, when incidents occurred between Japanese and Russian groups on the Heilongjiang River, Japan's intention was to test the reaction of the Soviet Union. As a result, the Soviet Union's attitude was extremely compromising. Japan then believed that it could implement its aggressive plan against China. However, in recent years, China has made rapid and obvious progress in politics, economy, and military affairs, and Japan will not be able to do whatever it wants."

<h3>China Issues Bonds in London</h3>
<p>Britain Agrees in Principle - London Newspapers Take Notice</p>
<p>[London] Britain's agreement in principle to China's issuance of £20 million in bonds in London is highly valued by newspapers here. However, it reiterated that the bonds were not immediately available. Various parties are inquiring about the details of the matter with the Chinese Embassy and banks with headquarters in the Far East. According to the Financial News, unless the political situation in the Far East becomes clearer, there is no room for the necessary conditions for borrowing from China. The newspaper also stated that the British Treasury is very concerned about the loan, as it is part of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross's plan to help China improve its financial and economic situation. The newspaper further stated that part of the loan would be used to develop transportation, and a large amount of machinery and equipment would be purchased from the United Kingdom. In addition, the Birmingham Post published an editorial today saying that the intention of this loan agreement is sufficient to show that some countries, including the United States, will disregard Japan's intentions and decide to provide practical assistance to the Nanjing government so that the Chinese nation can stand on its own. This is something to be congratulated for China. Furthermore, creditors must know for sure the purpose of the loan, which should be of a definite non-military nature and should be conducive to China's social and economic situation. They must also obtain a direct and fairly practical right in China's economic interests and the consolidation of the current Chinese government, so that aggressive countries will have to pay attention.

If China joins the German-Japanese Anti-Communist Agreement to eliminate communism in the East, peace in East Asia can be ensured. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>German Advisors in China</h3>
<p>German Political Circles Consider Recall</p>
<p>[Berlin] German political circles are currently considering whether to recall all German military advisors in China. If the current conflict between China and Japan continues and the German military advisors remain in China, Japan may regard this as an unfriendly move. In short, Germany is willing to maintain absolute neutrality in the dispute between China and Japan. Although the military advisors in China are hired in a private capacity, they are all German citizens and are subject to the power of the German government. (Havas, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>

<h3>British Plan for World Peace - Five Steps</h3>
<p>Seeking to Improve Relations with Italy and Germany - Eden to Visit Rome Next Month</p>
<p>[London] German Foreign Minister Neurath and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano are likely to visit London in mid-September. However, British Foreign Secretary Eden may visit Rome first. If this development proceeds smoothly, the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany can sign a treaty to maintain peace in Europe. It is understood that the current plan has about the following five steps: ㊀ Eliminate misunderstandings between Britain and Italy, ㊁ Improve relations between Britain and Germany, including the signing of a new Locarno Treaty or Germany's return to the League of Nations, ㊂ Eliminate the threat of the Spanish Civil War to world peace, at least withdraw a part of the foreign volunteers, but at the same time recognize the Spanish National Army as a belligerent group, ㊃ Britain and Japan conclude a political agreement to stabilize the situation in the Far East. Before the establishment of this agreement, it is of course conditional on the absence of a long-term conflict between China and Japan, ㊄ Britain and the United States conclude a commercial agreement. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the question of reconciliation between Britain and Italy, people in London believe that the two sides have decided to conduct negotiations in Rome in early September to discuss in detail the principles agreed upon by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in their recent exchanges of letters. (Havas, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Rome] According to an observer, the prospects for negotiations between Britain and Italy will inevitably lead France to participate in the matter, which should also be supported in France. According to Italian newspapers, the controversy against France has stopped for a long time, which makes it easier to improve relations between France and Italy. Those in charge believe that if the tense relations between France and Italy can be eased, the negotiations between Britain and Italy will also be greatly facilitated, and the rapprochement between Britain and Italy will be enough to divert the political axis formed by Germany and Italy, which should be welcomed by France. Those in charge also said that recently, public opinion in Britain and Italy has undergone the necessary evolution, which has led to closer relations between the two countries. In the future, the diplomatic authorities of the major European countries may reach an agreement within the possible scope. This agreement may be called the New Locarno Treaty or the Four-Power Pact of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. In short, the purpose is to promote the stability of peace in Europe.

<h3>West European Convention Issues</h3>
<p>Germany and Italy Support British Proposal - Organize Expert Committee to Study</p>
<p>[London] The British government recently sent notes to the governments of France, Germany, and Italy on the matter of the future West European Convention, advocating the organization of a committee of experts in London to study it. British diplomatic circles recently announced that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received reports from British envoys to Germany and Italy stating that Germany and Italy have expressed their support and are willing to send experts to London. However, Italy insists on two demands: ㊀ Britain must first recognize Italy's sovereignty over Abyssinia, ㊁ The expert committee must have political power. On this level, Germany advocates that the expert committee should be limited to a purely technical nature in accordance with the British proposal. (Havas, Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The "Berliner Tageblatt" stated that Germany, Italy, Britain, and France are the four major powers in Europe, and their interests are intertwined. If they can link the two groups that maintain the status quo and break the status quo and lay a solid foundation for peace in Central and Western Europe, all countries will benefit. The West European policy, rather than the first after-the-war policy of France, has caused war fronts in Eastern Europe, and the establishment of a peace system remains a problem to be solved. If the four major powers in Europe can trust each other, there will be no shortage of opportunities for cooperation. There are currently four major issues that must be resolved in the process from maintaining the status quo to peaceful improvement of the status quo: ㊀ Equality in armaments, ㊁ Economic cooperation, ㊂ Ethnic minorities, ㊃ Mandated territories. If these problems can be dealt with in a constructive manner, they will be easier to solve. (Haitong Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Insists on its Original Position on the Spanish Question</h3>
<p>Opposes Recognizing Spanish Belligerents - Non-Intervention Committee Adjourns</p>
<p>[London] The Sub-Committee of the Non-Intervention Committee has now decided to adjourn and wait for a new convening. In addition, a committee of experts has been organized and will begin to investigate the means of maritime and land surveillance. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, after negotiations were held by the governments of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy yesterday, it was reported that an agreement was to be concluded by the four governments outside the Coordinating Committee, agreeing that after the foreign volunteers in Spain had been substantially withdrawn, the two parties involved in the civil war in the country would be recognized as belligerent groups. This agreement excludes the Soviet Union and may be submitted for discussion at a meeting of the sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee this week. The Soviet Union has always maintained its previous position, which is, in fact, equivalent to refusing to recognize the Spanish National Army as a belligerent group. However, the Soviet Union agrees that this issue can be resolved by other countries concerned outside the Coordinating Committee, and the Soviet Union will not participate in the signing. For this reason, the issue of recognizing belligerent groups will be separated from the compromise plan proposed by Britain, and Russia will be excluded and resolved by other countries in its place. As for the other parts of the compromise plan, they will still be used as the basis for concluding a general agreement. It is not yet known whether Germany and Italy will accept this new plan, but according to this new plan, Germany and Italy should no longer use Russia's opposition to recognizing belligerent groups as a reason to advocate the revocation of the two laws of Britain and France. If so, it is not hopeless to establish a compromise between the two extreme propositions. (Havas, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>

<h3>Russian Newspaper Comments on Japan's Ambitions</h3>
<p>Strongly Criticizes British and American Connivance</p>
<p>[Moscow] Izvestia stated, "At the beginning of the North China Incident, some rulers in Britain and the United States ignored the signs of the incident and deliberately underestimated the meaning contained in it, calling it a 'local incident' that often occurs. This position, of course, suits the Japanese bandits' intentions. They know that the United States has adopted a policy of isolation and does not actively strive for peace, and that Britain continues to make concessions and compromises, so they recklessly launch an all-out resolute offensive. 'Some people in the ruling classes of the world powers, especially Britain, still hope that Japan's aggression against North China can take another direction, at least temporarily no longer continue to advance towards Central China, South China, and the Pacific Ocean. Recent developments have proved that this illusion is completely wrong. On the one hand, Japan sees that Britain and the United States do not effectively oppose it, and on the other hand, it has practically experienced that there are many difficulties in the 'other direction', so it decides to continue to advance in the direction of the weakest resistance, penetrate deep into the interior of China, and prepare for large-scale provocations against Central China and South China, directly infringing on British interests. At the same time, recent events have also proved that Japanese imperialism will never be satisfied with annexing China, and its intention is to turn China into a training ground to create favorable conditions for a new war of redistribution.' 'Judging from the recent situation, it is even more surprising that Mr. Eden has invited Germany and Italy to jointly mediate the Sino-Japanese conflict. This is like seeing the victim being strangled by a robber, but not only sitting idly by, but also urging other accomplices who specialize in robbery to take up the task of occupying Manchuria. It has proved that it is useless to beg Japanese imperialism to lay down its butcher knife and restore its reason, and it is also futile to expect the Japanese warlords to respect international obligations. The truth is completely clear that any isolated policy that refuses to strive for peace together, any policy of non-interference in Japanese aggression, any policy of concession and compromise before the Japanese bandits, will only promote their more reckless aggression and increase the danger of world war. The Japanese warlords only recognize one authority, that is, the authority of force. If they want to stop the atrocities of the Japanese warlords and avoid world war, they can only establish an effective international peace organization, and only by uniting the countries of the world that are willing to strive for peace and actively fighting for peace can they achieve practical results.'

<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Mandates Commission met today to discuss the Royal Commission's Palestine report. There were many concessions to Britain. British Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore spoke on behalf of Britain, saying that if it was thought Britain was trying to shed its responsibility under the mandate system and wanted the League of Nations and the Mandates Commission to be responsible for British policy, it was a complete misunderstanding of Britain's attitude. He emphasized that Britain was governing Palestine on behalf of the League of Nations. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Anti-Enemy Support Association Cables, Urging Stop to Residents of Neighboring Counties Moving to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Cables Sent to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Governments Ordering Subordinates to Handle - Concessions Are Not Paradise, No Need to Move Here</p>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association yesterday cabled the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments, stating: "Regarding the recent influx of residents from counties near Shanghai along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, seeking to avoid war, the population of Shanghai is already at its peak. Residents of Zhabei have mostly moved south to the concessions, and housing is already a problem. If residents from nearby counties continue to move in, food shortages will inevitably occur. Shanghai is the largest coastal city in China, and considering the tragedy of Tianjin, Shanghai is unlikely to escape unscathed. The concessions are by no means a paradise on earth. Even from a safety perspective, Shanghai is far inferior to the inland areas. Therefore, it is not advisable for residents of your province to move to Shanghai. We hereby request your government to order the county governments near Shanghai to use effective measures to prevent residents from migrating to Shanghai, to maintain order and avoid displacement. We earnestly hope for this." Addressed to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Zhejiang Provincial Government.</p>

<h3>Xiao Zhenying Returns to China Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wen Yingxing Arrives in Shanghai on the Same Flight, Yang Hu and Others Greet Him</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying, a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and former mayor of Tianjin, traveled abroad with Minister Kong in April to inspect industries in Europe and America. Recently, upon hearing of the tense situation in North China and the imminent outbreak of all-out war, he immediately cut short his inspection, transferred from England to America, and took a postal airline flight back to China. He arrived at Longhua Airport yesterday at 4:20 PM on a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Hong Kong. Wen Yingxing, a military attache to the special mission to England for the coronation of the British monarch, also arrived on the same flight from the United States. Those who went to the airport to welcome him yesterday included Mayor Yu's representative Wang Shaosu, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Central Committee member Chuan Rulin, Municipal Police Bureau Chief Cai Jingjun, 29th Army Shanghai Office Li Guang'an, Beijing Office Li Shijun, and Du Yuesheng, Wang Ziyao, Kong Lingkan, Mrs. Xiao, and dozens of others. According to Xiao, speaking to a Shenzhou News Agency reporter at the airport, he returned to China in haste to face the national crisis together. The country is in deep crisis, and we can only pledge to serve the country to save it from peril. After arriving in Shanghai, he will stay in Shanghai for one night and then proceed to Nanjing to meet with the authorities. The decision on when to go north will be made after arriving in Nanjing. Regarding his inspection abroad, because the time was very short, what he gained was limited. However, he deeply felt that the progress of science and material construction in Europe and America in recent years is truly astonishing. Our country should strive to catch up urgently, which is also a key point in saving the country. Detailed information will be drafted into a report soon and submitted to the government for reference. According to Wen Yingxing, he accompanied Minister Kong abroad and, after attending the coronation ceremony of the British monarch in England, inspected the army in Europe. Because the national situation is urgent and he is a soldier with a military position, he decided to return to the motherland from the United States by plane. Minister Kong is still in France and will also depart for China soon.</p>

<p>Saving Daoist Ritual Fees to Save the Country</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce advises all citizens to save money on Daoist rituals and temple fairs and donate it to save the country, stating in an announcement: "During the Mid-Autumn Festival, it has been customary to hire monks to perform Daoist rituals and for the City God to go on patrol, ostensibly to eliminate disasters and seek blessings, but in reality, wasting money on useless things. Our citizens must know that today the nation has reached a critical juncture of life and death. Without a country, the people are at the mercy of others. Where do blessings come from? Today, saving this useless expense and using it to save the country is the way to eliminate disasters and seek blessings. The Chamber of Commerce sincerely advises citizens and hopes that social leaders and leaders of public offices and guilds will lead by example and jointly advocate this. The future of the nation depends on it."</p>

<h3>Ningxing and Daxing Ships Safely Arrive in Ningbo Amidst Hurricane</h3>
<p>Huaxing Radio Station Erroneously Broadcast Sinking News, Announcer Sent to Police Station Requesting Exemption from Prosecution</p>
<p>The Ningxing, a passenger ship of the Sanbei Company on the Ningbo route, departed Shanghai for Ningbo on Thursday at 5:00 PM with over 40 passengers. After 11:00 PM that night, the Huaxing Radio Station in Shanghai suddenly broadcast a report stating that the Ningxing ship, after leaving Shanghai, encountered a hurricane in the waters of Dajishan, the ship sank, and all passengers drowned. After the spread of this shocking news, the families of the ship's crew and passengers, believing that the radio station's broadcast must be accurate, many women rushed to Wharf No. 2 on the Bund that night and wept bitterly at the Huangpu River. Until 6:00 or 7:00 AM yesterday, a large group of men and women, young and old, went to the Sanbei Company to inquire about the truth. The people at the company said that there was no such thing, and where did this shocking rumor come from? The people said that the Huaxing Radio Station had already broadcast it, and the company was trying to deceive the public. The company then announced to the public the telegram that the Ningxing ship had already arrived in Zhenhai, but the people still did not believe it, and more and more people came. The company then sent another telegram to inquire and received a reply from Ningbo stating that the Ningxing ship had arrived safely in Ningbo at 8:00 AM. The original telegram was posted, and the people finally believed it and gradually left. The Sanbei authorities then summoned the announcer of the Huaxing Radio Station to the company and questioned him as to why he broadcast the rumor and where the information came from. The announcer replied that it came from a telephone report. The company then asked why he did not inquire with the company to verify the information before broadcasting it, which was intentionally malicious. After consulting with lawyer Jiang Yiping at the company, the announcer was detained at the police station pending punishment. In the afternoon, the Huaxing Radio Station repeatedly pleaded with Sanbei, willing to publish an apology in the newspaper today, stating that it was due to mishearing a telephone report, and requesting exemption from prosecuting the announcer. Sanbei, after the station's earnest pleading, has agreed to a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>Also, the Daxing ship of the Daxing Company, which originally ran the Wenzhou-Taizhou route, recently changed to the Ningbo route because the Hongxing ship was being repaired. This ship departed Shanghai for Ningbo on the 3rd of this month. After leaving Shanghai, there was no news. Rumors of its misfortune have spread throughout Shanghai. Because there was no radio equipment on board, it was impossible to inquire about its whereabouts. All parties in Shanghai have been deeply concerned about the whereabouts of this ship in recent days, fearing that it had encountered an accident. Until yesterday afternoon, the company received a telegram from the ship, reporting that it had arrived safely in Ningbo. The company then informed all sectors, and the people were greatly relieved.</p>
<p>The Hongshun ship of the Datongxing Company, which was heading to Shashi on the Upper Yangtze River, encountered a hurricane outside the Wusongkou on the morning of the 5th. Fortunately, it dropped anchor early to take shelter. However, the wind and waves were too strong, and the anchor chain broke. A large iron anchor was lost at sea. Fortunately, the ship was not damaged. A telegram has been sent to Shanghai yesterday stating that the ship has set sail for the Yangtze River.</p>

<h3>General Labor Union and Municipal Chamber of Commerce Discuss Wartime Production Control Yesterday</h3>
<p>Urging Major Industries to Intensify Production, Letter Sent to Banking Industry to Continue Lending and Regulating</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union, considering that the survival of the nation has reached a final juncture, and in order to concentrate the strength of all workers in Shanghai and prepare to contribute to the country, specially invited the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the China Industrial Federation, the National Goods Factory Federation, the Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation, and other organizations at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss issues such as wartime industrial production control in Shanghai. Over 20 people attended. Chairman Zhou Xuexiang reported that in this extraordinary period, industrial production must be strictly controlled. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "Wartime is like peacetime, and peacetime is like wartime." Therefore, we should ensure that various important productions are not interrupted due to wartime. If the rear area is not well prepared, it will greatly affect the morale of the front lines.

<h3>Anti-Enemy Support Association Announces Measures for Collecting Scrap Copper, Aluminum, and Iron</h3>
<p>Resistance Requires Strengthening Military Material Resources, Collection Divided into Citizen and School Groups</p>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association yesterday announced measures for collecting scrap copper, aluminum, and iron, hoping that all sectors will donate to strengthen military material resources. The registration of the wartime service corps organized by the association will close on the 10th. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Origin of Collection</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident, a full-scale war may break out at any time. The supply of military materials will also increase sharply. However, military materials depend on raw materials. Once the external supply of raw materials is cut off, wouldn't we be helpless? Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said, "We must make a long-term resistance in order to achieve the final victory." However, long-term resistance should have preparations for long-term resistance. Only after strengthening military materials can there be a possibility of long-term resistance. The Association, in view of this, has specially formulated measures to collect scrap copper, aluminum, and iron in order to strengthen military material resources and turn useless things into useful things. Once the war begins, the whole country will be scorched earth. All military materials will either be destroyed or used by the enemy. If they can be quickly transported for military use, it would be a good plan. When the country is about to be destroyed and the home is about to be lost, patriotic compatriots should jointly support it.</p>
<p>Collection Measures</p>
<p>(1) Scrap copper, aluminum, and iron refer to materials that cannot be used and have already been discarded as waste. Copper can be yellow copper, white copper, purple copper, etc., such as broken copper cans, old wax threads, leaky copper, spittoons, etc. Aluminum is commonly known as steel essence. The steel essence pots and steel essence utensils sold on the market are all included. Iron can be pig iron, wrought iron, bar iron, iron blocks, etc., all are collected. However, iron sheets are not accepted. (2) The collection methods are divided into two groups: citizens and schools. (A) For citizens, the following locations are designated as collection points. Citizens can voluntarily submit to the following locations starting from August 7th: (1) Municipal Education Association at No. 200 Daji Road, Nanshi. (2) Inside the Charity Group on Datong Road, Zhabei. (3) Dashanghai Consumer Cooperative on Pobo Road in the French Concession. (4) He'an Primary School and Municipal Peide Primary School on Xinzha Road in the Public Concession and Huasheng Road. (5) Huatong Factory on Dongchang Road, Pudong. (6) Jiangwan Municipal Office. (7) Wusong Chamber of Commerce. (8) Inside the Beixinjing Defense Corps. (B) For schools, each school will be responsible for notifying students to collect from families and relatives and then send them to the original school for temporary storage (copper, aluminum, and iron should be stored separately). After a certain amount has been collected, the school will send it to the above-mentioned collection points in the citizen group for collection. (3) After a certain amount has been collected in each location, the Association will collect it, melt it, and submit it to the government for use.</p>

<p>President's Address</p>
<p>After performing the formalities, President Du Yuesheng delivered an opening speech, stating, "Our association is holding its annual meeting today, coinciding with a very serious national crisis. The people of the country are filled with resentment. The only way to cope with this situation is to avoid empty talk, work diligently, support the government, implement established policies, and strive to maintain local stability, so that the people will not suffer from displacement. If the government can focus wholeheartedly on external affairs and the rear is free from worries, that is our inherent duty and the long-cherished aspiration of our colleagues. Time is precious, and I do not wish to say more. I am willing to join my colleagues in making concerted efforts."</p>
<p>Amendment of Articles of Association</p>
<p>Following the Secretary-General's report on association affairs, the meeting approved the draft budget for expenditures from July to December of the 26th year and amended Article 3 of the articles of association, increasing the number of directors from fifteen to twenty-one.

<h3>Girl's Suicide Due to Being Unable to Attend School</h3>
<p>Nurse's Uniform Found, Corpse Examined Yesterday</p>
<p>On the morning of the 4th of this month, at around 10 AM, a young woman went to the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road to book room 729. She registered her name as Fang Bing, 20 years old, from Nanjing, and carried two leather suitcases and one lead-lined suitcase. The next morning at 4 AM, a tea server, Zhang Asheng, found the woman suspicious. He first called the room but received no answer. He then managed to climb in through the window and found the woman unconscious and lying on the bed. He reported it to the Lao Zha Gate Police Station, and an ambulance was called to the scene and rushed her to the Renji Hospital, but it was too late, and she died. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. We now know that after Detective He Lian Zeng of the police station went to investigate, he found two nurse's uniforms with red crosses on the shoulders, as well as medical books and magazines, and four empty bottles of sleeping pills in the suitcase. There was also a suicide note that read, "I really want to study, but my circumstances do not allow it. Therefore, I feel sad, angry, and disheartened, so I do not want to live," etc. It was determined that the woman had committed suicide by taking poison. The corpse was taken to the Philanthropic Road morgue yesterday, and Prosecutor Tang was dispatched by the First Special Court to verify the corpse. He verified that the deceased was Fang Bing, female, and had died from an overdose of sleeping pills. Before the relatives of the deceased are identified, the corpse will be placed in the care of the Pushan Villa for encoffining. The belongings of the deceased should be sent by the police station in charge to the court for claiming.</p>

<h3>Murder and Rape Case on Huade Road</h3>
<p>Adulterer Strangles Husband and Then Commits Suicide, Both Died and Autopsy Performed Yesterday</p>
<p>Wu Kunyuan, 23 years old, a native of Changshu, lived in a pavilion room at 53 Youbangli, No. 640 Huade Road. At 2:30 AM the night before last, Wu was sound asleep with his wife, Chen, 20 years old, also a native of Changshu, when Jin Yongliang, a fellow villager, sneaked into the pavilion room and threatened Chen with a knife to keep her quiet. Chen hurriedly woke her husband, Wu Kunyuan, who jumped up and fought with Jin. Furniture and electrical wires were damaged in the room. In the end, Wu was no match for Jin, and was stabbed in the right eye. Wu stumbled out in pain and collapsed on the stairs, dying shortly after. Seeing the enormity of his crime, Jin Yongliang slit his own throat with a knife and fell down in the pavilion room. Wu's wife, Chen, was terrified and reported it to the neighborhood watchman of Youbangli, No. 532, who telegraphed the Yulin Road Police Station, dispatching Detective Li Pengfei to investigate. Wu's body was sent to the Feilun Road morgue, and Jin Yongliang was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital. However, he had sustained too severe injuries and died at 8:00 AM yesterday. Chen Fuer, the father of Wu's wife Chen (also living in a third-floor attic), was suspected of being an accomplice to the murder and was taken to the police station. At 9:00 AM, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Li Zhishan stated that after investigation, Wu Chen had a physical relationship with Jin Yongchang. She admitted it in the police station. He asked for an extension for detailed investigation. Judge Zhong Qing questioned the two defendants and ordered them to be detained again for further verification. Zhang Zongru, the prosecutor, went to the morgue for the autopsies of Wu Kunyuan and Jin Yongliang. He found that Wu Kunyuan, male, died from knife wounds sustained during his life, and Jin Yongliang, male, committed suicide out of fear of punishment. Wu Kunyuan's body was handed over to his wife's father, Chen Fuer. Jin Yongliang's family had not been identified, and the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for encoffining.</p>

<h3>Counterfeit Currency Case: Japanese and Korean Accomplices Testify in Court</h3>
<p>Ishii Nobuyoshi Wrote a Confession, Further Investigation Required, Re-Hearing Postponed</p>
<p>Liu Bin from Tianjin, Zhou Yuqing from Henan, Yang Jingxian from Songjiang, Zhao Shusheng from Anhui, Jin Diqing from Jiaxing, a woman surnamed Zhou Yang, etc., colluded with Japanese and Korean individuals Wada Hidefu, Torita Seiji, Ishii Nobuyoshi, Misan Ihei, Hiyo Mitsu, Yang Yu, Yang Gongchen, Yang Jinzhang, etc., to counterfeit our country's legal currency, the 5-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China, and the 1-yuan banknotes of the Guangdong Provincial Bank. The Chief Inspectorate, including Chinese Inspector Lu Liankui, Detectives Liu Shaokui and Zhu Shuling, and Western Detective Beibeining, etc., successively arrested them at Room 511 of the Hua'an Hotel and No. 23, Lane 142, Xihua Road, No. 25, Hualong Road, etc., and seized 400 counterfeit 5-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China, as well as the machines and copper plates used for counterfeiting, etc. Except for Wada and the other eight, who were handed over to the Japanese Consulate for investigation, the remaining six, including Liu Bin, etc., were sent to the First Special Court for trial and detention. The details were reported in this newspaper on the 31st of last month. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide opened the first criminal court to hear the case. Jin Diqing hired lawyer Fan Gang, and Yang Jingxian hired lawyer Xu Wufang, to appear in court for defense. First, the police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated the facts and then claimed that, according to Articles 195 and 196 of the Criminal Law, the crime of manufacturing and using counterfeit currency should be prosecuted to the court. However, Zhou Yang's case was found to be unrelated, so it was requested that she be released from detention. The Japanese and Korean accomplices were also brought to court today. However, only Ishii Nobuyoshi seemed to know more details about the case. He had written a detailed confession for the court to refer to. If there was anything unclear, he could be summoned for questioning, etc. Then, Chinese Detective Zhu Shuling reported the process of arresting the defendants (details omitted as previously reported). Finally, the responsibilities of each defendant were explained in detail. It was said that Liu Bin was found in possession of 400 counterfeit banknotes at the Hua'an Hotel with Wada and the other four Japanese. Zhou Yuqing was arrested at Ishii's home. The 400 counterfeit banknotes were said by Liu Bin to have been given to him by Zhou Yuqing, but Zhou claimed that he obtained them from Yang Jingxian, so Yang was also arrested. As for Zhao Shusheng and Jin Diqing, they were related to the case of jointly organizing the counterfeiting of Guangdong Provincial Bank banknotes with Deng Cigan from Hong Kong and Ishii. Six copper plates of the counterfeit banknotes and spare parts of printing machines were also seized, etc. After the court questioned Ishii, it questioned each of the defendants and then postponed the hearing for further investigation. Zhou Yang was released.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case in Suzhou: The Victim, Startled and Afraid, Was Interrogated</h3>
<p>Testimony Unusually Vague, Kidnappers Remanded for Further Trial</p>
<p>Jiang Didi, a six-year-old boy, lived in Zhangjiali, Chenmu Town, outside the Loumen Gate of Suzhou. On the 14th of last month, he was lured to Shanghai by kidnappers and hidden at No. 6 Jupelias Road in the French Concession. A letter was sent to his family, demanding a ransom of 1,000 yuan. The day before yesterday, Yan Ying, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, received a tip from an informant that the kidnappers were drinking tea and waiting for news at the Changchun Tea Garden, No. 376 Maiteheshituo Road. Detective Yan reported to the captain and, together with Chinese Inspector Zhu Jihuang, Detectives Wang Runhe, Hu Guangrong, Zhang Yaoji, and two other detectives, went to the tea garden at noon and arrested ten people from Suzhou, including Gao Amao, Pu Asan, Chen Ahai, Ma Asi, Wang Jinbao, Chen Zhigao from Haimen, Zhou Xiaoyue from Ningbo, and A Song, Dai Xiaodi, and Jin Genrong from Kunshan. They also arrested two more accomplices, Li Asi and Gao Xiangsheng, from Suzhou, in a bungalow at Zhangjiazai on the same road. After Gao confessed that there was another accomplice, Jiang Genrong from Suzhou, hiding at No. 13 Maiqili, Maiqi Road in the French Concession, Chinese and Western detectives went to the French Concession, quietly went to No. 13, and arrested Jiang Genrong. After a while, they received another tip that the victim, Jiang Didi, was hidden in a house at No. 6 Jupelias Road, guarded by a young maid, Zhu Caiying, whom the child called "elder sister."

<h3>Accomplice Denies Involvement in Du Wenkui's Wife Murder Case</h3>
<p>Xu Qingen Arrested and Tried in Court, Request to Summon Du Li for Confrontation</p>
<p>Du Wenkui (aka Du Liu) from Qingjiang, angered that his wife, Du Li, had committed adultery with Zhou Baolin, losing all face, conspired with Xu Qingen, the brother-in-law of his younger brother Du Wenzhang (aka Du Qi), on January 19th of this year to trick Du Liu and his wife into having dinner, and lured them to Meilin Lane on Jinling Road, Zhabei. There, he stabbed her more than twenty times. Because she was too shameless, he also slashed her face with a knife. However, she revived after death and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Although she recovered, her face was scarred, and she no longer had her former charm. She accused Du Liu, his elder brother Du Wu, his younger brother Du Qi, and Xu Qingen of attempted murder. At the time, except for Xu, who was at large, the three Du brothers were arrested and sent to the District Court. Du Wenkui (aka Du Liu) was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for attempted murder. Du Wu and Du Qi were found not guilty. Xu Qingen was wanted. Xu Qingen has now been arrested by the Detective Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau and transferred to the court. Judge Wu Zongyu interrogated him yesterday. Xu testified that he did go to dinner with Du Liu, but he did not help Du Liu kill his wife. It was not discussed with him, and he did not trick Du Li into coming out. He asked for her to be summoned for confrontation, as he was innocent. His previous testimony was obtained through torture by the Detective Brigade. The court adjourned to summon Du Li for questioning, and the defendant was remanded.</p>

<p>Idle Talk</p>
<h3>Some Opinions on Staging "Defend Lugou Bridge"</h3>
<p>— Luo Caiqing</p>
<p>"Defend Lugou Bridge" is only able to meet us on stage today, which, as Mr. Li Yi said a few days ago, inevitably gives a sense of being "late," but as the preface to "Defend Lugou Bridge" says, "We use the pen when we have a pen, and the mouth when we have a mouth. When both mouth and pen are insufficient, we will let our soldiers fight the enemy with flesh and blood on the battlefield. We are unwilling to be slaves, and we are willing to guarantee the eternal existence of our nation with blood to the enemy." Although Lugou Bridge has now fallen—and even Beiping has been lost—the nation has an iron-like heart and will fight the enemy with flesh and blood on the battlefield. The roar of "Lugou Bridge can be our grave" will guarantee that we win the final victory.</p>
<p>What I want to say now are a few opinions regarding staging "Defend Lugou Bridge." The announcement from the China Playwrights Association says, "This play relinquishes its performance rights, and all domestic and foreign theater groups are welcome to rehearse and perform it freely." This is worthy of our support. "Fix bayonets, brothers, spread out!" (See the interlude "Fix Bayonets" in the second part of "Defend Lugou Bridge"—dedicated to the soldiers of good China) This is not only the great duty of the soldiers of the Republic of China, but also the unanimous action of the entire nation, because "The Chinese nation is a collective of iron! We cannot lose an inch of land! When soldiers die in battle, the people will replace them! When husbands die in battle, wives will replace them!" (See the theme song of "Defend Lugou Bridge") However, in several larger cities, such as Shanghai and Nanjing, there are many theater groups, but in other remote areas, people don't even know what "spoken drama" is. They are also members of the "collective of iron," but their mouths and pens have no place to be used, and this responsibility should be borne by mobile theater groups. We must use the power of agitation to awaken and connect the people in various places. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is best for several small theater groups to unite, with each group taking charge of a scene, such as Group A being responsible for the first scene, and Group B being responsible for the second scene, etc. After pre-determining the route of departure, they should travel in groups. For example, Group A performs the first scene in a certain place and immediately sets off for the second destination, while Group B fills in and continues to perform the second scene... In this way, the number of people can be reduced, the action will be more convenient, and they can quickly penetrate into the interior. Moreover, they can use the performance style of "Put Down Your Whip," that is, in open spaces, streets, and alleys, setting up a curtain as a house and erecting a bamboo pole as a door, and performing there. We don't need to study acting skills; we only need to express the emotions in the play to stimulate and agitate the audience. It is said that Mr. Tian Han expressed this opinion during the performance of "Lugou Bridge" in Nanjing.</p>
<p>As for local groups that can organize theater groups automatically, that is naturally even better. As mentioned above, the performance aspect can be as simple as possible, preferring to save unnecessary consumption and perform more shows. Moreover, locally organized theater groups may use dialects for performance. The language in our country is not uniform, and performing in the national language can be alienating in many places. Performing in dialects can not only fully express the performers' emotions, but also make the listeners feel particularly close, which is more reliable in terms of effectiveness.</p>
<p>The current public performance of "Defend Lugou Bridge" in Shanghai can only be held at the Penglai Grand Theater in the Nanshi area due to the special circumstances of the concessions, which we find distressing, but we should also take advantage of the strengths of mobile theater groups and set off to Caojiadu, Pudong, and other areas in the simplest form to perform. This is not only a hope for the China Theater Group Liaison Society, but also the responsibility of other small theater groups. As for the duration of this performance, it is said to be only four days, and the highest ticket price is one yuan, which seems too exclusive. The performance period is so short, perhaps due to the workers' time constraints, but we may expand the scope, concentrate all talents, and have whoever is available perform, without limiting it to these few people, so as to extend the performance period. The ticket price is as high as one yuan, which may be due to the high rent of the theater or other excessive expenses, but later we can have a few special performances, lowering the ticket price; it would be best if it could be sold for ten cents or five cents. These are just my personal opinions.</p>
<p>These personal opinions are also what the "preface" hopes for: that this script can be widely performed in the front and rear, and even more hopes that the audience who have seen the play can resonate with us—all the people and officers in the play—and shout:</p>
<p>Defend Lugou Bridge! Defend North China! Defend the Motherland! All those who are unwilling to be slaves, rise up!</p>
<p>Reportage</p>
<h3>Under the Sunshine</h3>
<p>— Zhifu</p>
<p>North China is being ravaged by the devil's hooves. The drums of war have sounded, and finally, the storm has stirred the entire Chinese nation. However, although a part of our South China populace has already awakened, others are still shrouded in the darkness, living the same lives as usual. In this environment, we young people are like volcanoes, ready to erupt from the earth's crust at any moment. We will never forget the great mission we bear!</p>
<p>However, our main task is not to rush to the battlefield with guns, but to make the people aware of who is the culprit and the true murderer in this North China incident. Therefore, this group of young people, singing "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves... braving the enemy's gunfire, advance!" with excitement and enthusiasm, walked into every slum.</p>
<p>The first afternoon of starting the propaganda.——</p>
<p>It was a day with intense sunshine. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, and the wind was still. This slum was like a cast iron pan that had been scorched red, filled with heat waves everywhere. We walked along this winding path, and after half an hour of torture, we finally stopped on an open space where garbage had been piled up into mounds and sewage had flowed into streams.——In front of this open space were about a hundred or so low houses like pigeon cages.</p>
<p>Odor, heat, thirst—at this moment, the trinity intertwined in each of our bodies. But we didn't relax our current position because of this and prepared everything.</p>
<p>At this moment, many people had already surrounded us on both sides: especially a group of children, desperately tugging at shoulders and raising their legs, squeezing rough, dirty faces out of the crowd and shouting in strange voices, as if watching some kind of show:</p>
<p>"The student brothers are here to speak, Mom! Come listen..."</p>
<p>"Come and see!............"</p>
<p>The adults were also as excited as ants finding scattered fish bones, and gradually everyone dropped their work and surrounded the four of us.</p>
<p>The number of people kept increasing, and at first they whispered to each other, starting arguments. Then, they revealed welcoming smiles to us; and there were two or three people who I personally saw vying for a dilapidated bench so that we could sit down in peace.</p>
<p>"Sir, please speak!"</p>
<p>After a noisy and chaotic sound, an unusually serious mood returned in an instant. Then one of our partners began to speak:</p>
<p>"Brothers, uncles! Our Tianjin and Beiping have now been seized by the strongmen, who are killing and setting fires everywhere. Most of the houses over there have been destroyed!... Although the soldiers are risking their lives on the front lines, they are bombing us with planes and cannons. We don't know how many compatriots have been killed or injured at Lugou Bridge and Changxindian.——We are in the rear, and we can't tolerate it anymore. We should prepare and use our fists as weapons to fight..."</p>
<p>"Beat to death the ×× people! We want to fight!——"</p>
<p>Suddenly, his passionate voice was scattered by the voices of the people around him! In the crowd, many eyes were bathed in blood: angrily raising thick arms. Every face was covered in beads of sweat the size of soybeans...</p>
<p>However, in order to prevent the police from giving us the crime of "disturbing public order," we hurriedly stood up and shouted at the top of our voices:</p>
<p>"Don't yell, everyone listen quietly!"</p>
<p>We strained our throats before suppressing their roars. Then our partner continued to say:</p>
<p>"Don't worry! We've already sent troops to the front to fight! ... But when the north is in danger, you in the rear must not listen to the temptations of evil people and become traitors, causing us great damage! ——"</p>
<h3>Defend Lugou Bridge ㊁</h3>
<p>— Written by Chen He</p>
<p>In a small teahouse near Lugou Bridge, at this time, there was a one-legged veteran soldier named Liu Debiao singing "Ballads of Lost Territory." The lyrics went:</p>
<p>"One territory after another is lost, Jilin, Zhening, Heilongjiang: After Rehe, it's Hebei and Chahar, aggression is rampant day by day.</p>
<p>Like splitting bamboo without resistance, the enemy is even more ambitious: Since ancient times, water is blocked by earth, and soldiers are blocked by generals, how can we have no response when bandits come to fight?"</p>
<p>Old Liu's ballad won everyone's praise, and some even asked for "another one," but Old Liu said, "I'm just a rough old man, I don't know how to sing any songs. I learned this from the team before."</p>
<p>So he talked about Gubeikou, where their Twenty-ninth Army's Big Sword Brigade left a bit of prestige. Old Liu exchanged one of his legs for one of the Japanese devils' tanks, and dozens of lives...</p>
<p>There was someone named Ding Datou who asked him: "Since the Big Sword Brigade was so impressive, how come they didn't kill all the Japanese devils?"</p>
<p>Old Liu said, "I don't know about that. The superiors told us brothers to retreat."</p>
<p>"Damn it! They're willing to be traitors!"</p>
<p>"Traitors are also our enemies!..."</p>
<p>"That's right!" The four of us couldn't help but give a loud round of applause to those stubborn compatriots. They smiled triumphantly and continued to listen to our advice.——</p>
<p>"...We know that most people become traitors for their own livelihood. They are poor, so they naturally like to do it for a while, but this is a mistake! You must guard against each other. If anyone discovers that someone's behavior is suspicious, report it to the local police station immediately, and that is also a very great merit!..."</p>
<p>"Okay! We will definitely follow this method: However, the ×× people are bullying us too much. We demand that they be driven out of North China... If you see the adults, please convey a message for us little people————"</p>
<p>That tall young man said these big words excitedly, and we were almost moved to tears; we had almost forgotten that we were standing under the intense sunlight, suffering from the heat waves....</p>
<p>After about an hour, in order to instill these ideas into a wider range of citizens, we left this sun-scorched area.</p>
<p>As we left, this crowd of people waved to us and shouted heartily:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, goodbye!——"</p>
<h3>"How How"</h3>
<p>— Changqing</p>
<p>When I was young, I read "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." When Zhuge Liang gave instructions to his generals, the author used "thus and thus" and "in this way and in this way" to lightly pass over the military plans without elaborating. This method was not related to "military secrets," but was merely a foreshadowing technique used by the author to create twists and turns in the story. In fact, Zhuge Liang must have explained the plans of deployment to all his generals.</p>

<p>On the fourth of the month, a news item was published in various newspapers under the headline "Government Colleagues' Opinions are Completely Consistent":</p>
<p>"Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch" A report from the Central News Agency: The spokesperson for the Ministry of Military Affairs stated: Since the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, our government has been prudently responding according to its established policy, and the opinions of the entire country are completely consistent. Government colleagues have no different opinions. The foreign reports claiming that He Yingqin and others advocated "how how" are absolutely inaccurate and are likely based on false rumors.</p>
<p>This is another category of "how" in addition to "thus" and "in this way." And the reason why there is this category of "how" is probably not a conspiracy by traitors, but slander by the enemy. Because since the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, the Central Government no longer used foreshadowing techniques in its statements. It has long announced the minimum four-point position and the determination to sacrifice to the end at the final moment. The central government's national policy, "thus and in this way," has long been known to every household and child. If one wants to carve out a path of "how" from "thus and in this way," it is nothing but a conspiracy by traitors and the enemy.</p>
<p>The enemy and traitors want to carve out a path of "how" from our national policy of "thus and in this way." Although there is no certainty, Shigeru Kawagoe, who had been delaying, finally flew from Dalian to Shanghai. The implication is very thought-provoking. He said, "Although his strength is weak, he still hopes to be able to transform Sino-Japanese relations on the last crisis line, and do his best to adjust national relations. However, given the general trend, he fears that he may not be able to. If that is the case, then the aftermath can only be left to the young people." He is using "adjusting national relations" to open up a path of "how," and using "leaving it to the young people" to intimidate our established policy of "in this way." This is truly an excellent diplomatic expression. And the Tokyo Central News Agency's report added the sentence: "Great expectations are placed on Kawagoe's trip here." It seems to convey that the enemy really has no territorial ambitions. It seems that there really is a path of "how" that can be opened up. This truly makes people exclaim, "What to do! What to do!"</p>
