<h3>國聯會通過報告書宣布日本違犯條約</h3>
<p>報告書列舉日本侵略種種事實　各國應援助中國增强抵抗力量　召開九國公約國會議進行調解</p>
<p>［日內瓦］國聯大會已定於今日下午五時開會、二十三國委員會之報告書定可遇過、惟波蘭瑞士及暹羅等國、大約將不投票、至依違兩可者、聞美總統之演說後、已均有所决定、國聯方面認美國已有放棄其超然獨立之傾向、故極為欣慰、再則美總統之言論、必係受中國境遇之刺激、而係對日本所言者云（中央社六日路透電）</p>
<p>［日內瓦］國聯諮詢委員會十三國小組委員會反覆考慮與辛勞工作後、今日對於報告書已成立結論、聲明日本侵犯中國、實違反九國公約與非戰公約、該委員會並通過另一文件、建議邀請九國公約簽字國、從速開會、以期用調解方法、終止中日戰爭、此二文件旋皆由二十三國諮詢委員會全體通過、有三國未投票、卽加拿與瑞士、欲向本國政府請訓、波蘭則謂、諮詢委員會忽視會議規程而成立危險前例云、</p>
<p>諮詢委員會並通過提交國聯大會討論决議草案如下、“國聯大會㊀核准第二報告書中所載之提議、並請主席對於國聯會員國之為九國公約簽字中者開會、採取必要之擧動、㊁表示對於中國予以精神上之援助、並建議國聯會員國不得採行削弱中國抵抗力量致增加其在目前衝突中困難之任何行為、並應考慮彼等可各個援助中國之程度、㊂决定本屆會議休會、並授權主席於諮詢委員會請求時、再召開會議、”</p>
<p>衆意此案較前預料者更利於中國、此殆羅斯福總統之演說有以致之因此結果、不日或在倫敦召開之太平洋列强會議、常能以若干有效的援助、給予中國也、</p>
<p>小組委員會第一報告書載稱、“中日兩國對於爭端與引起敵對行為之原因、各執一詞、惟事有莫可爭辯者、卽日本大軍、侵入中國土地、估據運北平在內之廣大土地、日政府復施行海軍計劃、對鎖中國海岸、以斷絕中國航運、日機又在中國各處、大肆轟炸是也、本委員會於研究提交會議之各事實後不得不以為、㊀日本在海陸空三方面之對華戰爭、按諸引起此次衝突之偶發事件、全不相稱、㊁日本此種行為、不能便利或增進其政治家所稱為日本政策的目的之兩國聞友好合作、㊂日本此種行為、在現有合法的自衛方法或權利之根據上、實無正富理由、㊃日本此種行為、實與日本在九國公約與非戰公約下之義務大相牴觸”、</p>
<p>報告書劈頭卽追述一九三七年七月聞事件及緒溝橋事變、並陳述中日雙方對於此事之互相矛盾的言論、繼謂、當交涉正在進行之時、大批軍隊之調動、致使時局愈臻惡劣、七月底、華北敵對行為乃爆發、日軍在華北之作戰、激起中國境內活潑之反饗、日本政治家旣發表中國必須退讓之空言採行聚急財政計劃、旅華日僑復有撤退中國之行動、於是中國朝野、不得不作日本已决計以其我力擊破中國抵抗之論斷、䢔至八月第二星期、中國政府人民所抱日本欲以武力征服中國之見解、愈益信而有徵、蓋中外利益被此密切連繋之上海、雖有使戰事避難努力卒成第二戰塲也云、</p>
<p>報告書於略述有關係之各條件後、謂報告書第一節所陳述之顯明事實、已證明日本破壤其對華與對他國之義務、日本在此環境中之敵對打為、按諸其尊重中國主權獨立與士地完整之義務、旣相牴觸、卽鞍諸其除以和平方法外不得以武力解决其對華爭端之義務、亦相逕庭、在華日軍之地位必須能證明確為保護合法駐於中國之日本軍民所必要之自衛計劃、始能與日本所負之條約義務不相衝突觀於七月十三日中國蔣委員長之演說、七月十九日中國致日本之牒文、及七月二十七日日本首相之言論、足徵雙方初皆以為偶發事件、可地方化、而和平解决可獲取、乃在較早階級中、日本已開始表示不僅欲獲地方解决、且决計欲得兩國間各種問題之總解决焉、報告書於其叙文結論處謂七月十九日之倫忘錄、（願接受國際公法所載各項和平解决方法者、）現仍為中國政府之政策、此乃無可疑者云、</p>
<p>委員會第一報告書載稱、維持條約義務而尊重之、此在各國關係極為重大、中國現有局勢、不僅涉及中日兩國、而世界各國亦皆有關係、許多國家在其國人生命與物質利益上、已受直接影響、然與各國尤關重要者、厥為和平之恢復與維持．吾人不承認此次衝突僅可由中日兩國直接解决之、全部問题必須予以研究、尤其是遵照国聯盟約與國際公約以恢復和牛之適當方法、此外、必须繼續努力、謀以調解恢復和平、九國公約簽字國已允於需要時舉行完全面坦直之商榷、故本委員會决議從速邀請九國公約簽字國、開始商榷、並希望羅致與遠東有特殊關係之其他各國之合作云諮詢委員會無論如伺將於一個月內再開一度會議、（中央社六日路透電）</p>
<h3>國聯大會延會後昨開最後會議</h3>
<p>美總統演說影響重大　暹邏波蘭仍表示棄權</p>
<p>［日內瓦］國聯會大會第十八屆常會已定於本日午後五時舉行最後一次會議通過關於中日糾紛之决議案、預料此項决議案不至引起何項反對、一般觀察著以為、昨晚開會時若干國家代表團雖曾要求大會延緩將决議草案提付表决、其用意不在反對該决議草案、乃欲向本國政府請訓之後、然後投票耳、消息靈通人士并以為、决議草案內所列各項决議、闕係實非細小、益以美國羅斯福總統日昨在芝加哥所發表之演說、其性質因而愈形重要、且羅斯福此項演說、對於大會昨日之辯論、亦有重大之影饗云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［日內瓦］國聯大會今晚八時四十五分開會、討倫關於中日斜紛之决議草案、挪威與加拿大兩國代表、均主張向各該國政府請訓、挪威代表並要求延會、大會卒乃議决於明日午後五時开會、俾將决議草案捉付表决、中英兩國代表至最後時間、亦均接受挪威代表之建議而贊成延會藉免各國代表有被迫投票之譏、國聯會人士頃聲明、大會延會之舉並無何項政治意羲存乎其間云、茲將大會討論情形、詳誌於下、</p>
<p>暹邏代表宣稱、渠因不及向本國政府請訓之故、决定棄權、波蘭代表加瑪尼基亦决定棄權、并謂决議草案主張委託某某國（指九國公約各簽字國）處理中日糾紛、此在彼蘭未便予以接受、抑各該國未來行動、亦不能使國聯會其他各會員國受其約束、挪威代表亨勃羅則以决議草案內容、至最後時間始乃通知諮詢委員會以外各國、引為憾事、南非聯邦代表亦附和此說、至是英代表艾立特法代表彭古先後發表演說、中張决議草案應立卽予以通過、艾立特之言曰、國聯會所能採用之和解方式、務當在最廣泛之基礎上付諸實施、以故吾人主張依照華盛頓九國公約之規定、立卽採取實事求是、而具有建設性質的捷速行動、但同時並不脫離國聯會之範疇、彭古之言曰、時局情形嚴重若是、吾人至少應在心理上完全一致、法國對於次議草案、明白而無保留的加以接受、抑此項决議草案、內容並不足以妨礙和解努力、而做說明主要三點、㊀卽中國文化、較諸吾等大多數國家遠為古裔、現方遭受慘酷之境遇、自當在精神上予以贊助、㊁任何行動凡足以妨礙中國抵抗力量者、均當避免之、㊂勸告凡與遠東問題最有關係各國儘量援助中國、凡此三點、詞意旣極明白又極溫和、此外决議草案又將國聯會與代表法律之一種區域協定（指九國公約）聞關聯予以聞明、但同時並未將責任諉諸九國公約簽字國質言之、國聯會現仍履行其職責、並委託範圍較小之委員公與國聯會協力維護和平而已、</p>
<p>蘇聯代表李維諾夫繼起發言謂、“諮詢委會業戶搜集各項要索、足以證明侵略行動、但未用“侵略”字樣、又按之决議草案所載國聯大會僅在精神上贊助中國、而未在實質上援助該國、此在吾人亦引為憾事、惟國聯大會會期並未結束、諮詢委會亦仍執行職務、而中國所獲得者、亦較尋常鼓勵尤勝一籌、叮謂差强人意、蘇聯茲以國聯會忠實會員國之資格、希望國聯會對於中國履行其全部職責焉嗣由中國代表顧維鈞發言、謂時局戰重情形、諮詢委會能予以了解、殊足稱道該委會所提各項建議、雖遠不足以使吾人獲得滿足、而吾人仍準備予以接受、但附有條件卽中國代表團得以隨時重行提出其原來要求是也”、顧氏詞畢、各國代表均熱烈鼓掌、至是挪威代表享勃羅謂、茲事體大要求大會將决議草案暫援提付表决、並謂此舉、此非反對决議草案之謂、實因若干國代表欲向各該國政府請訓、並相互進行磋商而已云云、瑞典丹麥兩國代表亦均贊助此議、大會乃用舉手法、通過挪威提議、並决定於明日午後五時賡續開會、（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>我代表團表示滿意</h3>
<p>［日內瓦］國聯大會中日問題諮詢委員會通過决議草案之後、中國出席國聯會各代表均表示滿意、代表團發言人並向哈瓦斯社訪日發表談話稱、吾人會欲將美國前國務卿史汀生所揭渠之中義、即不承認以武力侵佔之士地一項主義、列入决議草案之內、但因澳洲聯邦代表勃魯斯根據法珅觀點、提出異議之故、未能成為事實、目前决議草案旣已明白譴責侵略國吾人甚感滿意、草案又向國聯會各會員國建議、務勿採取任何措置、致中國自衛力量為之減弱、此𨾈應解釋為各國暗在精神上接受約束、勿在財政與軍火方面接濟日本、俾得加強侵略力量、至於太平洋各國他日舉行會議之後、國聯會亦仍當注視遠東時局之演進情形、並於必要時、採取各項措置、總之、吾人已在政治精神方面、擭得相當程度的勝利、則固顯然無疑也云云、（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>抗戰時期的民主集權</h3>
<p>— 張志讓</p>
<p>日前國府命令將國民大會延期開會。在此全面抗戰時期，當然應該如此。然而這並不是說：抗戰延長一日，則民權政治就應該展緩施行一日，而是相反地，正惟因為我國需要全民抗戰，所以民權政治尤為必要。不過在此期內，它的機構和運用，較之平時，應該有些不同而已。</p>
<p>平時的民權政治就是歐美各種民主政制中的最澈底的一種。中山先生在民權主義第五講裹闡明民權政治的性質，有這樣的幾句話：‘今日我們主張民權，是要把政權放在人民掌握之中。那末人民成了一個甚麼東西呢？中國自革命以後，成立民權政體，凡事都是應該由人民作主的。所以現在的政治又可以呌做民主政治；換句話說，在共和政體之下，就是用入民來做皇帝。’關於人民行使這個皇帝的職穢——就是政權——的方法，中山先生又說：‘有了四個民權，便可以直接管理國家的政治。這四個民權又呌做政權，就是管理政府的權。’‘這四個權是選舉權，罷免權，創制權，複决權’（均見民權主義第六講（‘必具有此四大民權，方得謂為純粹之民國也’（見民權初步序）此外人民還有一般憲法所保障的集會，結社，言論，信敎等自由。這樣就是平時的民權政治。</p>
<p>平時的民權政治，到了國難嚴重像我國全面抗戰以前最近幾年的樣子，就必須要特別加強它的機構的一部分——就是整個政治機構的權力應該集合於中心的一點此外一切民權政治的運用均與平時相同惟有這樣，才能使政府一切的設施都受支配於鞏固國防的原則之下，全國人民的力量都運用到準備抗戰的目標上去。這就是國防時期的民權政治——它的特點就是民主集權。（參閱本年七月十一日本報週刋所載中心集權與民主基礎一文）。</p>
<p>現在全面抗戰已經展開，中心集權，自然比以前的需要更大；民主基礎，是否因此遂可忽視呢？</p>
<p>民主與集權，並不是兩個對立的觀念，它們實在是相輔而行的。民意不能直逹中心，人民的情况和需要就不易瞭解，中心權力的行使就難得如響斯應地指揮如意。政治機構的權力不集中，人民也就得不到一個居中吸引之點，使他們一切的力量都集合起來，運用到抗日上去。况且要能最後戰勝敵人，我們必項由軍隊的抗戰發展到全民的抗戰——把全國民衆的力量與軍隊的力量相配合。這样才可使日帝國主義的人砲與飛機，因四面受擊，進退維谷，而失其效用·所以民主與集權，在此抗戰時期，實在都比以前的困難時期——更比平時—為重要。不過在此期內，它們都需要一種適應抗戰的進展而已。</p>
<p>民權政治在此抗戰時期所需要的進展就是民主集權簡單化。這個簡單化是有兩方面的。</p>
<p>在集權方面，整個的政治機構應該因為軍事旁午而簡開化。不但疊床架屋之弊應該竭力避免，就是平時的繁重機紐也要改進。否則中心權力就不容易運用自如。這是集權機構所需要的進展。</p>
<p>在民主方面，民權運用的程序也應該要簡單化。在此抗戰時期人民與政府更應該有息息相通的關係。所以民意機關的需要更比平時為迫切。這種機關應該要有中山先生所倡民權的具體而微的職權。而它的產生和進行恰應該探取極簡單的程序。普遍的選舉，在此全力對付敵人的時候，不但是不相宜並且是不可能的。產生戰時民意機關的簡單方法，試舉一二個例子，就像前後方抗敵軍隊和各地方人民團體的推選（包括尋常法定團體各銀行公會，商會等及抗戰時期的愛國團體等。（以後跟着民衆運動的推廣，和民衆組織的進展，行使推選權的團體也就叮以逐漸增加。這不過是略舉一二例子，究莧如何才算適當的簡單程序，却是一個值得進一步研究的問題。此外言論，出版，集會，結祉的自由尤須竭力提倡。報章刊物的意見亦應隨時注意。目的是在使人民的要求直達政治的中心，中心的權力直貫社會的四周。</p>
<p>這個簡單化的民主集權就是抗戰時期的民權政治。它的圓滿實現，實在是抗戰勝刋的最大保障。</p>

<h3>一個俘虜灑盡酸辛淚</h3>
<p>希望不要再打下去　還故鄉依舊做店夥</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者、在閘北遇到被我軍俘獲的敵軍、他的悲慘的遭過、激起了記者對他的同情心、</p>
<p>他名加籐佐一、日本佐世保的士者、今年二十六歲、在一家小商店做職員、昭和八年、他已經退伍了、這回軍事緊急、又被徵入伍、九月十六日、從佐世保動身、十八日到了上海、集合在北四川路底敵海軍司令部中、九月二十八那一晚、參加作戰、從廣東街進襲我們的陣地、被我軍猛投手溜彈、炸倒在女子小學的屋角裏、額角和左頰都受了傷、暈倒在那兒、等他醒了過來、孤獨只留下一個人、可是我國的軍隊也沒發見他、他躲在屋角裏動也不敢動、一天一天過了、到了十月四日的晚上、他實在餓得不能支持了、想試試爬出屋角從那兒逃走、就在門口被我軍抓住了、</p>
<p>他、很疲憊地在張參謀主任面前站着、幾乎站也站不住、主任呌他坐了下來、他口渴得很、喝了很多很多熱茶、他滿臉都是粗黑長鬍孑、那雙灰塵罩滿的布鞋和的臉非常相稱、主任先呌他說說自己的身世、他的酸淚滴下來了、他的聲音那麼低而滯重、他說、</p>
<p>‘我是一個小商人、我的母親年紀老了、我們家境很不好、我的小弟幼妹一家人、全靠我在小店做小夥計的一點月薪過過活、現在我出來了、也不知她們怎麼過活下去、’他的眼皮給熱淚所浸透、我知道他在懷念他的家、他的老母小弟和幼妹、尤其是懷念他剛結了婚的愛妻、他把愛妻的照片、給我們看、他說、</p>
<p>‘今年六月、我才結婚、我們做小商人結婚眞是不容易的、我的愛妻她眞能吃苦、我不知道她今後得怎麼活下去、’我們贊美他的妻子的美麗、他搖搖頭、嘆那冷透心骨的長氣、他的身上所帶那些神符、一定是他的老母和新婚愛妻所贈予的、其中包含最深切的人生悲酸、他的母妻定是朝夕焚香、替他在祝福、</p>
<p>張主任問他對於作戰的感想、他說、他只不過是一個上等兵、不大知道什麼、只知道他所認識的熟人、一個一個的不幸信息都傳來了、他自己也不知命在何時、他自幸變成了俘虜、總還有一綫生還希望、他說、大家都不加道為什麼要和中國打仗、大槪是外交辦得不好、以致兩國開戰了、他唯一的希望、是不要再打下去了、讓他可以回家鄕去、依舊做做小夥計、讓一家老小可以活下去、</p>
<p>他的哀訴、他的酸淚、使我們每一個人都非常感動、但是戶外砲聲隆隆、敵人的魔手正在那兒舞動、咳、日本軍閥、眞是人類的劊子手呢、</p>
<h3>伊藤來滬何為</h3>
<p>歐美人士已洞如觀火　空言奚益徒勞往返耳</p>
<p>盛傳來滬向歐美各國領袖有所活動之在野日本外交人員伊藤氏等一行、日前乘日輪上海丸由神戶啟程、經門司·長崎·駛滬、昨日（六日）上午七時抵埠、停泊匯山碼頭、日方高級人員均往輪埠迎迓、查暴日橫行、世所共知、歐美有識之士、决不為其所惑、預料伊籐等此來、亦不過徒勞往返而已、</p>
<h3>外輪載甬客來滬遭敵禁阻</h3>
<p>謂如下次再來旅客　須在匯山碼頭登陸</p>
<p>華義輪船公司之恩德輪、此次由甬返滬、有旅客七百餘名、從寗波來滬、乃船到上海、即至金利源碼頭停泊、船內旅客、正欲登岸、而租界當局、因現時正在遣送難民離滬之際、內地民衆、不應再來上海、當時乃動阻該批旅客上岸、仍令原船返甬　自下午四時起、至七時止、經寗波旅滬各界、向租界當局、證明此批旅客、多數為商人、交涉結果、方始允予登陸、各旅客在船、守候至晚間八時、遂得上岸、詎敵方海軍當局、昨日忽通知意領署、謂如果恩德輪、下次再從寗波載運旅客到滬、屆時决不許其開至金利源碼頭上岸、須改在匯山碼頭登陸云云、從今日起、寗波輪將不能再載旅客至滬矣、</p>

<h3>三士兵死守陣地獲得榮譽嘉獎</h3>
<p>哀師必勝抗戰前途璨爛</p>
<p>敵軍侵佔劉行鎮源源補充後、日前曾沿劉行廣福公路之南北進犯、攻我吳家宅及張家宅陣地、敵來勢兇猛、一度進至張家宅、旋經我增援反攻、將其擊退、恢復原陣地其南陸家宅方面、戰事亦激烈異常、我軍奮勇抵抗、惟敵方砲火猛烈、我軍傷亡甚重、最後僅有連長一人及士兵四人、仍扼守陣地、以機關槍掃射、敵不能前、旋連長亦中彈受傷、卽有一士兵負護退去、其餘三士兵、仍沉着應付、卒得生力軍馳到增援、將敵擊退、三士兵誓死守土之勇敢、已獲上峰榮譽嘉獎、</p>
<p>時評</p>
<h3>國聯的態度</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>記得美國前國務部長史汀生在‘遠東的危機’一書中有過這麼一句話。‘侵略是火災。如果不撲救。那是要從一塊地方延燒到全世界的。’</p>
<p>的確。這烈火從東四省燒到阿比西尼亞。從阿比西尼亞燒到西班牙。現在又在我們的大陸上大燒特燒起來。使全世界的和平國家十分着急了。</p>
<p>國際聯盟在性質上原是個世界的‘救火會’。它每逢火警從來沒有用全力來撲救。因此火勢是愈來愈熾盛了。</p>
<p>最近國聯諮詢委員會好容易通過了一個决議案。其中甚至連‘侵略’和‘戰爭’等字樣都絕對避用。這表明着。它因為顧忌放火者的緣故。不願直率的說出是火災。免得引起本身救火的義務。</p>
<p>國聯採取着這樣怯弱的態度。顯然由于操縱這個機構的有些政治家的苟安心理。要使他們把這一種心理克服。我們還須在外交上加緊的努力。</p>

<p>今晨三時、廣東街·虬江路·寶源路·東寶興路我軍、試行反攻、極為得手、斃敵軍三十餘人敵軍倉皇中、用平射炮向我攻擊、目的在破壞我建築物我亦以平射砲還擊、敵戰車受我砲火威脅、遂掩護其步兵紛紛後退、敵受重創後乃於今晨七時、以大砲向我轟擊、我未置理、今晨四時許、敵以大砲向我攻擊後、卽有戰車三輛、掩護其步兵二百餘人、向我八字橋進犯、我軍在橫浜河西岸與敵對峙、同時我另調精銳部隊、由柳營路向敵側擊、激戰一小時、敵遂不支潰退、是役斃敵五十餘人、獲步槍十餘支、輕機關槍一架、又上午敵機曾一度活動、嗣因大雨、遂停止飛行、同時敵軍大砲曾向我共和路寶山路轟擊甚烈、但與我工事無礙、</p>
<h3>偷渡敵軍被我截擊</h3>
<p>我派有力部隊增援堵截激戰未已</p>
<p>劉行方面、敵軍在楊宅偷渡蕰藻浜部隊、現被我嚴家灣守軍嚴堵激戰中、江家宅渡河部隊、似與唐橋（公路橋）渡河部隊互相呼應、昨日下午三時同時渡河我方已派有力部隊、前往增援堵截激戰、迄晨未止、</p>
<p>昨日下午劉行附近之敵、突向我某師陣地、攻擊甚烈當時該處我方守軍、卽奮起抗戰、激戰約一小時有餘、卒以衆寡懸殊、以致我張家宅至倪家園附近一帶陣綫、被敵突破、旋經我軍增援部隊趕到反攻後、敵始潰退、我遂恢復原有陣地、</p>
<p>昨晨二時許、敵軍約有數百人、分乘小艇二艘、利用漲潮機會、由蕰藻浜北岸東楊宅及南雨之顧家宅一帶、偸渡登陸、我南岸守軍、立卽奮力射擊、激戰至九時左右、我某師某旅、將江家宅陣地收復、敵軍被迫向東楊宅方面後逃、旋卽集中該處地帶負嵎頑抗、同時並施放烟幕彈、企圖南進、但已被我某師某旅所截阻、</p>
<h3>三井碼頭炸燬實况</h3>
<p>敵軍燃料已成嚴重問題</p>
<p>浦東其昌機日商新三井棧、共有浮碼頭四座、自左面起算、第一·第二·第三·三碼頭為該棧自用、第四碼頭向供敵駐滬兵艦運煤之用、俗呼海軍碼頭、四碼頭同盧三井棧界地內、並連一起、自敵侵滬以來、數次在各該碼頭企圖登陸、當於上月間、被我將一二三碼頭三座一併炸沉、而第四海軍碼頭、碩果僅存、敵軍竟在內藏有大批五金雜物、及運動器具如網球拍等、並有軍火一批、堆存於內、我方遂於本月四日清晨、再度用某項武器、將該碼頭炸沉、以斷敵登陸之唯一途徑、記者於今晨搭某外輪公司小輪前往察看損害情形、見四座碼頭連同浮橋、均已沉沒、海軍碼頭一浮橋則在爆炸時向上激起、反墮於岸上、可見炸力異常猛烈、至該碼頭本泊有我國某公司長德輪輪一艘、係於戰事未發生前運煤四千餘噸、在該棧候卸、滬戰起後、卽被敵軍刦持、陸續運去煤炭二三千噸、船內尚有一千餘噸、現已船貨一併被敵軍拖至別處、至三井棧內、現尚堆有煤炭一萬餘噸、此後數十艘敵艦、已不能再在該棧取煤、故其燃料一項、彼方已成一嚴重問題、惟有望煤興嘆矣、</p>
<h3>敵艦駛楊樹浦開砲</h3>
<p>向我浦東陣地無的放矢</p>
<p>敵機因天雨而未能活動、故由出雲艦率多數砲艦、駛往楊樹浦江面、開砲向我陣地轟擊、在雲霧瀰漫中、作漫無標的之亂射、移時卽停止、</p>
<p>昨宵以來、浦江敵艦已停止向浦東發砲、我砲隊亦暫行停轟、故全綫極為沉寂、惟自深晚起、敵艦每隔半小時、必用探海燈向浦東岸綫照射、旋卽熄燈、改用機檢掃射、以防我軍加以襲擊、故清脆機槍聲、時時可聞、直至天明始已、今晨八時、敵旗艦出雲、忽由四小輪拖駛離滬、衆料係暫時駛往淞口外、某處指揮各艦作戰、按該艦曾兩度中、我某項爆炸器受傷、數日前曾雇數十工匠加工修竣、該艦出口後、現由另一砲艦、代使在滬指揮職權云、</p>
<h3>敵司令部似將遷移</h3>

<p>昨日敵以坦克車二三十輛、掩護其步兵的數百名、攻擊我某師羅店西南方面嚴宅、杜宅之陣地、當敵軍進抵徐宅附近時、經我軍集中火力、猛烈反攻、敵軍不支瀆過、死傷極衆、至此敵乃用毒瓦斯、攻擊我軍、但我早有準備、無在損害、</p>
<h3>佐野部隊全軍覆沒</h3>
<p>大公社云、連日進犯我江灣愛國女校一帶陣地之敵軍佐野部隊、經我軍迭予圍困痛擊、迄至昨晚十二時止、已全軍覆沒、我軍並在其隊長桑田身畔、搜出日記簿及敵軍進犯路徑、以及各地配備軍隊數目之詳細軍用圖表二大幀、現均已一併送呈參謀部研究、此外進犯北站寶山路一帶之海軍陸戰隊近藤部隊、現亦被我軍殘滅大半、已潰不成軍云、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>現在世界各國。除與敵國有特别關係者外。任何一國之政界。商界。宗教界。學術界。及一切普通人民。不問性别。不問老幼。無不同情於我國。而痛斥敵人的獸類行爲。一致表示起而援助。此種情形。豈是宣傳。運動。呼籲。等等所能辦得到的事呢。</p>
<p>一個人欲人人呌好。固不容易。一個人欲人人呌惡。亦不容易。一個國家。亦是如此。此次日本侵略殘忍行爲。無論我國人親受其惠賜者。莫不咬牙切齒。恨不得食其肉而寢其皮。即傍觀者見之。亦莫不怒髮衝冠。攘臂欲起。即此一點觀之。則正義人道。尚在於人間。而不容野蠻殘暴之國家。蹂躪净盡。更於此可見。正義人道一時雖被野蠻殘暴之國家所蹂躪。而正義人道。仍必有復伸於世界之一日。倘世界而果成爲原始時代率獸食人之狀態者。則世界决不成爲世界矣。</p>

<h3>戰時讀物問題</h3>
<p>— 元生</p>
<p>讀九月卅日辛報慧敏君寫的一段插話‘過時照片’，我就聯想起了戰時靑年選讀刊物報章的重要了。</p>
<p>插話中說：‘良友的號外一戰時書刋’的第三期‘我軍江防’自中的幾幀相片，是‘一二八’時的，第四期‘壯志凌雲’頁中和第五期封面的我軍飛機相片，都是‘巢匪’時代的，尤其是第五期封面那張中三架飛機的號數（三○五，三一一，三○九）和二十三年二月一十八日航空署情報出版的第十五期‘航空露佈’裏面的完全一樣。”</p>
<p>這些，假定確是事實的話，那這個刋物，至少是負了‘欺騙讀者’的罪名。</p>
<p>自滬戰爆發後，新出版的雜誌報章，正多如雨後春筍，共中有‘貨眞價實’‘值得讚美’的，但也有‘一塌糊塗’‘不知所云’的。</p>
<p>在戰時的靑年，對於選讀這種刋物與報章，的確是非常重要。我們知道報誌報章，是負有鼓吹抗敵情緒的偉大的使命的，假定某種刋物，或某種報章，失去了他的信譽，那在宣傳上，至少是减少了一部份力量。</p>
<p>戰時靑年，應怎樣選讀雜誌報章，這個問題，我不敢解答，還得留待讀者們仔細的去檢討和研究。</p>
<h3>給戰時靑年</h3>
<p>— 競明</p>
<p>現在不是我們讀書的時候了！你想蘆構橋事件攪擾了我們一暑期，虹橋事件不是又毀滅了我們的學校嗎？假以‘九一八’，‘一二八’，情形比較，强寇二次進犯我國土，還不是單獨行動的習慣麼！</p>
<p>我們還有空研究什麼政治制度，我们還待研究什麽經濟學？我們也母庸學習什麼國際性的法律了，現實便是我們的敎訓啊！</p>
<p>上海的戰事距今已有五十多天。牠影響於國際的，據近日報載？英擬實力制裁日本，美抗議日暴行，我顧代表出席國際諮詢委員會，要求於討論中日案時承認日本為侵略國，其他如德京意法而總撥聚晤，西班牙戰事消息等，國際動熊顯露列强自決策略，我以及民族戰事之神聖·但是我們要認淸楚環境，我們耍做戰時靑年！</p>
<h3>語屑</h3>
<p>— 勞漁</p>
<p>“獻”金出力，這是人民愛國精神，充分的表顯，</p>
<p>“給”前方將士，以物質的援助，這是後方民衆應盡的義務。</p>
<p>“戰”死疆場，這是最光榮的犧牲。</p>
<p>“時”代告訴我們：在今日唯有抗戰，才能求得國家的生存，民族的復興。</p>
<p>“青”年們！在這國家存亡，决於旦夕的今日，我們該怎樣的負起這嚴重的使命？</p>
<p>“年”幼的兒童，你們也該盡量的省下糖菓錢，去多置幾顆子彈多打死幾個敵人。</p>

<h3>The League of Nations Passes Report Announcing Japan's Violation of Treaties</h3>
<p>The report lists various facts of Japan's aggression. All countries should assist China in strengthening its resistance. A conference of the Nine-Power Treaty signatories should be convened for mediation.</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Assembly is scheduled to meet at 5:00 PM today. The report of the Twenty-Three Nation Committee is expected to pass. However, Poland, Switzerland, and Siam are likely to abstain from voting. As for those wavering, it is heard that after President [Franklin D.] Roosevelt's speech, they have all made decisions. The League of Nations is greatly pleased as it believes the United States is showing a tendency to abandon its detached independence. Furthermore, President Roosevelt's remarks must have been stimulated by China's situation and were directed at Japan. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] After repeated consideration and diligent work, the Thirteen-Nation Subcommittee of the League of Nations Advisory Committee today reached a conclusion on the report, declaring that Japan's invasion of China violates the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The committee also passed another document recommending that the signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty convene a meeting as soon as possible to end the Sino-Japanese War through mediation. Both documents were then passed by the entire Twenty-Three Nation Advisory Committee. Three countries abstained from voting: Canada and Switzerland, which wanted to seek instructions from their governments, and Poland, which said the advisory committee had disregarded procedural rules and set a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee also passed a draft resolution to be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly for discussion and resolution: "The League of Nations Assembly (1) approves the proposals contained in the second report and requests the President to convene a meeting of the League of Nations member states that are signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty to take necessary actions; (2) expresses its moral support to China and recommends that the League of Nations member states do not take any actions that weaken China's resistance and increase its difficulties in the current conflict, and should consider the extent to which they can individually assist China; (3) decides to adjourn the current session and authorizes the President to reconvene the meeting at the request of the Advisory Committee."</p>
<p>It is generally believed that this case is more favorable to China than previously expected, largely due to President Roosevelt's speech. As a result, the Pacific powers conference, which may be convened in London soon, may be able to provide China with some effective assistance.</p>
<p>The first report of the Subcommittee stated, "China and Japan each hold a different view of the cause of the dispute and the outbreak of hostilities. However, some facts are indisputable, namely, that the Japanese army invaded Chinese territory, occupied vast areas including Beiping, and the Japanese government is implementing a naval plan to blockade the Chinese coast to cut off Chinese shipping, and Japanese aircraft are carrying out large-scale bombings throughout China. After studying the facts submitted to the meeting, the Committee cannot but believe that (1) Japan's war against China on land, sea, and air is completely disproportionate to the incidental events that caused the conflict; (2) this behavior of Japan cannot facilitate or promote the friendly cooperation between the two countries, which its politicians call the purpose of Japanese policy; (3) this behavior of Japan has no legitimate justification based on existing lawful means or rights of self-defense; (4) this behavior of Japan is in serious conflict with Japan's obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact."</p>
<p>The report begins by recounting the July 7th Incident in 1937 and the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, and presenting the conflicting statements of China and Japan on the matter. It continues, "While negotiations were underway, the movement of large numbers of troops worsened the situation. At the end of July, hostilities broke out in North China. The Japanese military operations in North China aroused vigorous reactions within China. Japanese politicians made empty promises that China must concede, adopted urgent financial plans, and Japanese residents in China took action to evacuate. As a result, the Chinese government and people had to conclude that Japan was determined to use its power to crush Chinese resistance. By the second week of August, the Chinese government and people were increasingly convinced that Japan wanted to conquer China by force. Although efforts were made to avoid war in Shanghai, where Chinese and foreign interests were closely linked, it eventually became a second battlefield."</p>
<p>After briefly outlining the relevant conditions, the report states that the clear facts presented in the first section of the report have proven that Japan has violated its obligations to China and other countries. Japan's hostile actions in this environment conflict with its obligation to respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and also contradict its obligation not to use force to resolve its disputes with China except by peaceful means. The position of the Japanese army in China must be able to prove that it is a necessary self-defense plan to protect the Japanese soldiers and civilians legally stationed in China, in order not to conflict with Japan's treaty obligations. Based on Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech in China on July 13, China's note to Japan on July 19, and the Japanese Prime Minister's remarks on July 27, it is clear that both sides initially believed that the incident could be localized and a peaceful solution could be achieved. However, at an earlier stage, Japan began to indicate that it not only wanted to obtain a local solution, but was determined to obtain a comprehensive solution to various issues between the two countries. The report concludes its narrative by stating that the memorandum of July 19 (willing to accept various peaceful methods stipulated in international law) is still the policy of the Chinese government, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>The first report of the Committee stated that maintaining and respecting treaty obligations is extremely important in international relations. The current situation in China involves not only China and Japan, but also all countries in the world. Many countries have been directly affected in terms of the lives and material interests of their citizens. However, what is particularly important to all countries is the restoration and maintenance of peace. We do not recognize that this conflict can only be resolved directly by China and Japan. The entire issue must be studied, especially the appropriate methods for restoring peace in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant and international conventions. In addition, efforts must continue to be made to restore peace through mediation. The signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty have agreed to hold full and frank consultations when necessary. Therefore, this Committee has decided to invite the signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty to begin consultations as soon as possible, and hopes to enlist the cooperation of other countries with special ties to the Far East. The Advisory Committee will convene another meeting within a month, regardless of the situation. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Assembly Holds Final Meeting Yesterday After Postponement</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt's Speech Has Significant Impact, Siam and Poland Still Abstain</p>
<p>[Geneva] The 18th regular session of the League of Nations Assembly is scheduled to hold its final meeting at 5:00 PM this afternoon to pass a resolution on the Sino-Japanese dispute. It is expected that this resolution will not cause any opposition. Observers generally believe that although some national delegations requested the Assembly to postpone submitting the draft resolution for a vote at the meeting last night, their intention was not to oppose the draft resolution, but to seek instructions from their governments before voting. Informed sources also believe that the resolutions listed in the draft resolution are indeed not trivial. Moreover, President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago the day before yesterday has made its nature even more important, and Roosevelt's speech has also had a significant impact on the Assembly's debate yesterday. (Havas, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Assembly met at 8:45 PM tonight to discuss the draft resolution on the Sino-Japanese conflict. Representatives of Norway and Canada both advocated seeking instructions from their respective governments. The Norwegian representative also requested a postponement of the meeting. The Assembly finally decided to meet at 5:00 PM tomorrow afternoon to submit the draft resolution for a vote. Representatives of China and the United Kingdom also accepted the Norwegian representative's suggestion at the last minute and agreed to postpone the meeting, so as to avoid criticism that representatives of various countries were forced to vote. League of Nations officials have stated that there is no political significance behind the postponement of the Assembly meeting. The details of the Assembly's discussion are recorded below:</p>
<p>The representative of Siam declared that he had decided to abstain from voting because he did not have time to seek instructions from his government. The representative of Poland, Mr. Kamanicki, also decided to abstain, saying that the draft resolution advocated entrusting certain countries (referring to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty) to handle the Sino-Japanese dispute, which Poland could not accept. Moreover, the future actions of these countries could not bind other member states of the League of Nations. The representative of Norway, Mr. Hambro, regretted that the content of the draft resolution was only notified to countries outside the Advisory Committee at the last minute. The representative of the Union of South Africa also echoed this statement. Thereupon, the UK representative, Mr. Eliot, and the French representative, Mr. Pongou, spoke successively, advocating that the draft resolution should be passed immediately. Mr. Eliot said that the reconciliation methods that the League of Nations can adopt must be implemented on the broadest possible basis. Therefore, we advocate taking pragmatic and constructive swift actions immediately in accordance with the provisions of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, but at the same time without departing from the scope of the League of Nations. Mr. Pongou said that the situation is so serious that we should at least be psychologically completely consistent. France accepts the draft resolution clearly and without reservation. Moreover, the content of this draft resolution is not enough to hinder reconciliation efforts, and three main points are explained: (1) China's culture is far more ancient than that of most of our countries, and it is now suffering a tragic situation, so it should be supported spiritually; (2) Any action that hinders China's resistance forces should be avoided; (3) Advise all countries that are most related to the Far East issue to assist China as much as possible. All these three points are extremely clear and mild in meaning. In addition, the draft resolution also clarifies the connection between the League of Nations and a regional agreement (referring to the Nine-Power Treaty) that represents the law. However, at the same time, it does not delegate responsibility to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. In essence, the League of Nations is still fulfilling its duties and entrusting a smaller committee to cooperate with the League of Nations to maintain peace.</p>
<p>The Soviet representative, Mr. Litvinov, then took the floor and said, "The Advisory Committee has collected various key elements to prove the act of aggression, but did not use the word 'aggression'. Moreover, according to the draft resolution, the League of Nations Assembly only supports China spiritually, but does not provide substantive assistance to that country. This is also regrettable to us. However, the League of Nations Assembly session has not ended, and the Advisory Committee is still performing its duties, and what China has obtained is even better than ordinary encouragement. It can be said to be barely satisfactory. The Soviet Union, as a loyal member of the League of Nations, hopes that the League of Nations will fulfill all its responsibilities to China." Then, the Chinese representative, Mr. Gu Weijun, spoke, saying, "It is commendable that the Advisory Committee can understand the serious situation. Although the various recommendations made by the committee are far from satisfying us, we are still prepared to accept them, but with the condition that the Chinese delegation can re-submit its original request at any time." After Mr. Gu finished speaking, representatives from various countries applauded warmly. Thereupon, the Norwegian representative, Mr. Hambro, said that the matter was of great importance and requested the Assembly to temporarily postpone submitting the draft resolution for a vote, and said that this move was not to oppose the draft resolution, but because representatives of several countries wanted to seek instructions from their respective governments and conduct mutual consultations. Representatives of Sweden and Denmark also supported this proposal. The Assembly then used a show of hands to pass the Norwegian proposal and decided to continue the meeting at 5:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. (Havas, Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Lord Mayor of London Presides Over Fundraising Campaign to Aid Wounded Soldiers and Civilians in China</h3>
<p>[London] The Lord Mayor of London, Sir Broderd Briggidge, has recently obtained permission from the government and cooperation from the Bank of England to conduct a fundraising campaign to raise funds to aid wounded soldiers and civilians in China. He has also issued an appeal to the financial community to immediately assist the Chinese people with practical and effective measures. Regarding this matter, representatives from the economic and financial circles will form a committee within days to be responsible for carrying out all activities. (Havas, Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Signatory Countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to Meet Within Two Weeks</h3>
<p>The venue will be in London, and related countries will be invited to participate.</p>
<p>[Geneva] The resolution on the Sino-Japanese dispute passed by the Advisory Committee of the League of Nations Assembly stipulates that the League of Nations Assembly should recommend convening a meeting of countries with special relations in the Far East, especially the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. According to general predictions, this meeting will be held in London within two weeks, and the Advisory Committee is scheduled to meet in early November, when it will be clear the outcome of the discussion at the meeting. (Havas, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Our Delegation Expresses Satisfaction</h3>
<p>[Geneva] After the Advisory Committee of the League of Nations Assembly passed the draft resolution on the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Chinese representatives attending the League of Nations Assembly expressed satisfaction. The spokesperson of the delegation also gave an interview to Havas News Agency, saying that we had wanted to include in the draft resolution the proposition put forward by the former US Secretary of State Stimson, namely, not to recognize the land occupied by force, but it could not become a reality because the representative of the Commonwealth of Australia, Mr. Bruce, raised objections based on the French perspective. We are very satisfied that the current draft resolution has clearly condemned the aggressor country. The draft also recommends to the member states of the League of Nations not to take any measures that weaken China's self-defense forces. This should be interpreted as tacit acceptance of the restraint that countries should not provide financial and military support to Japan, so as to strengthen its aggression. As for the Pacific countries' holding a meeting in the future, the League of Nations should also pay attention to the evolution of the Far East situation and take various measures when necessary. In short, there is no doubt that we have achieved a considerable degree of victory in the political and spiritual aspects. (Havas, Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Boycott Movement in England and New Zealand</h3>
<p>[Wellington, New Zealand] The dockworkers here recently decided not to handle any goods for Japanese ships. It has now been decided that, with the exception of scrap metal, they will still load goods for the Japanese ship Chifuku Maru. It is heard that the above decision was based on the instructions of the New Zealand Workers' Union after investigating the industrial movement in Europe and Australia. The instructions advocated that all goods except scrap metal should not be detained, and stated that this matter should be internationalized. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[London] The managers of consumer cooperatives in Nottinghamshire, England, have recently decided not to purchase Japanese goods. (Havas, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>US Sends Army Unit to Tianjin to Reinforce</h3>
<p>[San Francisco] A unit of the US Army boarded the transport ship Grant today and headed for Tianjin to strengthen the US garrison there. Among them, two platoons will land in Honolulu and the Philippines along the way. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the US Marine Corps has been reinforced in China, but this is the first time that the army has been sent to the Far East.

<h3>Two Schools of Thought Within the League of Nations</h3>
<p>[Geneva] Various countries originally held two different views on the Sino-Japanese issue. The first was advocated by China, the Soviet Union, and New Zealand, that the League of Nations should continue to discuss this issue. The second was advocated by the United Kingdom, that the League of Nations Assembly should submit it to the countries most concerned with the Pacific issue for discussion. The two are actually contradictory, because if the Sino-Japanese dispute needs to be handled through mutual contact between member states and non-member states in order to find a friendly solution, then the actions of the League of Nations will be hindered. Therefore, the resolution submitted by the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue to the League of Nations Assembly advocates "taking all appropriate measures to end the dispute through compromise," which refers to convening a Pacific conference. However, this conference is initiated by the League of Nations, and its failure or success is naturally a matter for the League of Nations. If the League of Nations Assembly passes this resolution today, it will not only "provide spiritual assistance to China," but also fail to specify the nature and scope of the assistance, and advise member states to "assist China separately." In addition, this resolution advocates that the League of Nations Assembly declare an adjournment and authorize the Advisory Committee to pay attention to the Far East situation and continue to meet within a month, "in Geneva or elsewhere." The so-called elsewhere mostly refers to London, and the Pacific conference may also be held there. If so, then the League of Nations' continuing to deal with the Sino-Japanese dispute will not be hindered. (Havas, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japan Limits Trade, International Balance of Payments Pessimistic</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry has formulated export and import licensing rules in accordance with the Provisional Measures Law on Export and Import Goods, which will be announced and implemented on the 10th. However, estimates vary as to how much imports can be reduced each year. According to official estimates, import restrictions can save 80 million yen on cotton, 60 million yen on wool, and 10 million yen on wood, totaling 150 million yen. Import bans can save a total of 35 million yen, totaling only 185 million yen. Because the outlook for improving the international balance of payments is still pessimistic, there are still items to be added for restrictions and bans, hoping to reach 200 million yen. However, reducing civilian needs cannot compensate for certain types of imports. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Mass Meeting Held in London, Archbishop Condemns Japanese Atrocities</h3>
<p>More Than 10,000 Notables from All Walks of Life Gather Together, Demanding Economic Sanctions from All Countries</p>
<p>[London] The mass meeting initiated by the Liberal Party's News Chronicle was held in the Albert Hall this evening, with more than 10,000 participants. The Chairman, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Lytton, Chairman of the League of Nations Manchuria Investigation Team in 1932, the Chairman of the London City Council, the leader of the opposition Labor Party, Mr. Morrison, and Professor Zhang Pengchun of Nankai University in China, all sat around the podium and spoke successively. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution expressing indignation at the Japanese army's bombing of Chinese civilians, and demanding that the British government initiate joint action with other countries in the economic and other fields to stop such atrocities by the Japanese army. (Havas, Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>[London] A public meeting was held in Albert Hall today to oppose Japan's invasion of China. There were no vacant seats. Dr. Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury, although he received a telegram from the British churches in Tokyo asking him not to chair the meeting, still attended the meeting on time and served as the chairman. In his speech, he screened a film taken in the war zone, entitled "Bombs Echo Through China."</p>
<p>The Archbishop began by saying that the purpose of the meeting was to oppose the killing and maiming of non-combatants, which is a characteristic of the tragic war in China today and has shocked the civilized world. We welcome the protests made by the British and American governments, but the ordinary people of Britain have not yet had the opportunity to express their grief and deep emotion. In the tragic situation of the war, the narration is inevitably inaccurate, but the things that shock and pain us are everywhere. In terms of human suffering, the recipient of a hundred people is no different from thousands of people. Although the Archbishop of Tokyo telegraphed to oppose my attendance at this meeting, I would like to state that I have special relations and friendships with Japanese Christians. I know that many of them must feel heartache because of my attendance here tonight. What I do not understand is whether they know the facts as we know them. However, even among friends, one cannot violate one's conscience. Conscience forbids us to maintain silence. If we remain silent, people will mistakenly believe that we acquiesce in the actions of the Japanese army. We now appeal to the Japanese government and its people to stop the actions of their naval and army commanders in China, so that Japan can remain among the civilized nations. I personally have not joined the application for the British government to act alone, and I do not want the assistance of other countries, but if the protest and application are not effective, then we should ask the government to first declare that if it can obtain the assistance of various countries to make its actions effective, then the British government is prepared to come forward and ask all countries to participate jointly. Any protest from the world today against the atrocities suffered by China, in all honesty, should lead to a protest from the world against the possibility of a re-enactment of this kind of atrocity on a larger and more tragic scale in the future. May the world not ignore the motto. The Doctor concluded by saying that we now record with shock and give a practical condemnation of the Japanese army's arbitrary attacks on non-combatant civilians in China, and urge the British government to take the lead in seeking joint action by various countries to implement economic plans or other methods that are sufficient to stop the continuation of the atrocities.</p>
<p>Next, Professor Zhang Pengchun of Nankai University gave a detailed account of the tragic situation of the war in Tianjin, saying that China is fighting today as a united and consistent nation, and its resistance has proven to be unexpectedly strong and will be able to support it for a long time.</p>
<p>Lord Lytton, Chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Team on the September 18th Incident, said that the war that Japan is conducting in China today is a kind of international evil. The most shameful point of this tragedy is the method of warfare that we are now opposing. The inventors were not Japan, but those who copied Europe. The Japanese army was trained and formed according to the Prussian military system and Prussian theories of terror. Japan regards treaties as waste paper and views the means of terror in war as the standard symbol of great military power.</p>
<p>Lloyd George sent a letter stating that if civilization must be preserved today, then all countries in the world that are more humane and work hard for peace should make aggressors realize through practical joint action that barbarism is not a race to win war.</p>
<p>Finally, the Duchess of Derby asked the audience to implement an economic boycott of Japan worldwide. Labor Party Secretary Morrison also made this request and wished the Chinese people victory in resisting aggression. Mr. Morrison also said that it would be even better to find a way to prevent Japan from continuing its aggression today. Conservative Party official Churchill, Liberal Party leader Tricklay, League of Nations Association Chairman Miller, and Ship Port Dockers Union Secretary Tillette all sent letters to the meeting expressing their opinions. Tillette believed that dockworkers all over the world would definitely make it impossible for Japanese ships to sail, which is the only way to stop the Japanese war.

<h3>Japan Sends Rear Official to China to Assume a Key Position</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Ministry of the Army transferred Rear Admiral Hiromu Machijiri, who was the aide-de-camp of the Bureau of Military Affairs, to be the director of the Bureau of Military Affairs and the chief secretary of the Military Council. Commander Yamasawa Moto-Toshiro succeeded him as the aide-de-camp. (Daimai News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Organizations Send Telegram to US President</h3>
<p>Expressing Respect</p>
<p>On the 5th, US President Roosevelt delivered a speech in Chicago, strongly condemning the atrocities of militaristic nations and striving to maintain world justice. The opinions of various countries unanimously responded. Our country, suffering from the invasion of violent Japan, is particularly inspired by the US President's expression of upholding justice. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other organizations sent a special telegram yesterday to express their respect. The original telegram stated: "To His Excellency President Roosevelt of the United States of America, we were delighted to read in the newspaper that Your Excellency's speech in Chicago, based on the highest principles of human justice and world peace, advocated international cooperation to contain the forces of violence. Your insightful views are universally admired. In particular, the Chinese people, suffering from the illegal aggression of militarism, feel as if they have seen a ray of light in a time of profound darkness. We hope that you will consistently adopt active measures to uphold the principle of world peace and strive for its realization. We send this special telegram to express our respect. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Local Association, Shanghai Educational Association, Shanghai General Labor Union." (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>US President's Diplomatic Speech Emphasized by All Countries</h3>
<p>Britain and France Welcome, US Public Opinion Supports; Comparable to Wilson's Previous Remarks</p>
<p>[Geneva] Diplomatic circles here believe that US President Roosevelt's speech yesterday is of great significance. It is not impossible that the League of Nations will make some progress as a result. It is also said that this speech has already had a decisive impact on future negotiations on the Sino-Japanese issue. (Central News Agency, 6th, Havas)</p>
<p>[New York] American newspapers unanimously praised President Roosevelt's important speech on American foreign policy. The New York Times considered Roosevelt's statement that "isolation is not a way to avoid war" to be an accurate and unwavering argument. However, the specific nature of Roosevelt's so-called "common action" remains to be seen as the situation evolves and Roosevelt elaborates. In any case, President Roosevelt's passionate remarks are sufficient to express America's deep indignation at Japan's inhumane actions. The Chicago Tribune said that President Roosevelt has now announced a new foreign policy. However, if this policy could be expressed in more precise language, it could be called the resurrection of President Wilson's foreign policy. (5th, Guomin Dian)</p>
<p>[Washington] Informed sources believe that President Roosevelt's speech today is the most important statement he has ever made on foreign affairs. Whether the United States will take action to prevent the spread of the Sino-Japanese conflict and the Spanish conflict is subject to much speculation. Some observers are convinced that the President's speech is in fact an expression of his intention to strive to exclude aggressor nations from world commerce. After reading this speech, people generally believe that President Roosevelt is currently seeking peace in all aspects, and is willing to provide unlimited moral assistance to any concerted efforts to restore world peace. Although no one believes that the United States is prepared to take the lead, many feel that the President's remarks are intended to encourage the League of Nations to adopt a more stringent and practical plan for aggressor nations, which the United States will fully support. (Central News Agency, 5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] Today's newspapers all published President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago yesterday in a prominent position, with particular emphasis on his statement that peace-loving countries should isolate countries that spread the plague of international anarchy. The Daily Herald interpreted this statement as President Roosevelt no longer refusing any proposal to apply joint pressure to Japan, saying that if the British government were to propose a concrete plan to Washington, it would be able to obtain a real opportunity for effective implementation. Other newspapers did not consider the President's speech to be an indication of a change in American policy. The Times also held this view, saying that those who reject methods of reconciliation and only value force, making reconciliation impossible, not only threaten their neighbors, but also endanger civilization itself, as President Roosevelt said. The threat they are warning against will ultimately be met not only with universal condemnation, but also with the joint resistance of all civilized nations, whose power should not be underestimated. (Central News Agency, 6th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Paris] French newspapers unanimously welcomed President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago, regarding it as a powerful contribution to peace. Le Journal stated that this was a solemn warning to those who intend to disrupt peace. Le Temps stated that the President has declared that if the United States wishes to avoid war, it must participate in collective peace. Le Petit Parisien stated that the President's remarks can be seen as a warning that the United States is now undoubtedly assisting the threatened countries in the Pacific.

<h3>Democratic Centralism During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhirang</p>
<p>The National Government recently ordered the postponement of the National Assembly. This is of course necessary during this period of full-scale war of resistance. However, this does not mean that the implementation of democratic politics should be delayed by one day for every day the war of resistance is prolonged. On the contrary, precisely because our country needs a national war of resistance, democratic politics is all the more necessary. However, its institutions and operations during this period should be somewhat different from those in peacetime.</p>
<p>Democratic politics in peacetime is the most thorough form of the various democratic systems in Europe and America. In the fifth lecture of his Three Principles of the People, Mr. Sun Yat-sen explained the nature of democratic politics with the following words: "Today, we advocate democracy because we want to place political power in the hands of the people. Then what do the people become? Since the revolution, China has established a democratic political system, and everything should be decided by the people. Therefore, today's politics can also be called democratic politics; in other words, under the republican system, the people are used as the emperor." Regarding the method by which the people exercise the duties of this emperor—that is, political power—Mr. Sun also said: "With the four rights of the people, they can directly manage the politics of the country. These four rights are also called political power, which is the power to manage the government." "These four rights are the right to elect, the right to recall, the right to initiate, and the right to referendum" (all see the sixth lecture of the Three Principles of the People). "Only with these four major rights can it be said to be a pure republic" (see Preface to the Fundamentals of Democracy). In addition, the people also have freedoms such as assembly, association, speech, and religion, which are guaranteed by general constitutions. This is democratic politics in peacetime.</p>
<p>When democratic politics in peacetime reaches a critical stage like the recent years before the full-scale war of resistance in our country, it is necessary to particularly strengthen a part of its institutions—that is, the power of the entire political institution should be concentrated at a central point. In addition, the operation of all democratic politics is the same as in peacetime. Only in this way can all government measures be subject to the principle of consolidating national defense, and the strength of the entire nation can be used to prepare for war. This is democratic politics in the period of national defense—its characteristic is democratic centralism. (See the article "Centralized Power and Democratic Foundation" published in this newspaper's weekly issue on July 11 of this year).</p>
<p>Now that the full-scale war of resistance has begun, the need for centralized power is naturally greater than before; can the democratic foundation be ignored as a result?</p>
<p>Democracy and centralism are not two opposing concepts; they are in fact complementary. If public opinion cannot directly reach the center, it will be difficult to understand the situation and needs of the people, and the exercise of central power will be difficult to command as desired. If the power of the political institution is not concentrated, the people will not be able to obtain a central point of attraction to gather all their strength and use it to resist Japan. Moreover, in order to finally defeat the enemy, we must develop from the military's war of resistance to a national war of resistance—combining the strength of the entire nation with the strength of the military. In this way, the Japanese imperialist's artillery and aircraft can be attacked from all sides, making it difficult for them to advance or retreat, and losing their effectiveness. Therefore, democracy and centralism are actually more important in this period of war of resistance than in the previous difficult period—and even more so than in peacetime. However, during this period, they both need a kind of progress that adapts to the war of resistance.</p>
<p>The progress that democratic politics needs in this period of war of resistance is the simplification of democratic centralism. This simplification has two aspects.</p>
<p>In terms of centralism, the entire political institution should be simplified due to the rush of military affairs. Not only should the drawbacks of redundancy be avoided as much as possible, but also the cumbersome mechanisms of peacetime should be improved. Otherwise, it will not be easy for the central power to be used freely. This is the progress that the centralist institution needs.</p>
<p>In terms of democracy, the procedures for the operation of civil rights should also be simplified. During this period of war of resistance, the people and the government should have a closer relationship. Therefore, the need for civil opinion organizations is even more urgent than in peacetime. This kind of organization should have the specific and miniature powers of the civil rights advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. And its emergence and progress should take extremely simple procedures. Universal elections are not only inappropriate but also impossible at this time when all efforts are being devoted to dealing with the enemy. As a simple method of producing wartime civil opinion organizations, let us give one or two examples, such as the election by front and rear anti-enemy troops and local people's organizations (including ordinary statutory organizations such as bank guilds, chambers of commerce, etc., and patriotic organizations during the war of resistance. (Later, with the promotion of popular movements and the progress of popular organizations, the organizations exercising the right to elect will also gradually increase. These are just a few examples. However, what kind of simple procedure is considered appropriate is a question worth further study. In addition, freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association must be vigorously promoted. Attention should also be paid to the opinions of newspapers and periodicals at any time. The purpose is to make the people's demands reach the center of politics directly, and the power of the center penetrate the periphery of society directly.</p>
<p>This simplified democratic centralism is democratic politics during the war of resistance. Its complete realization is truly the greatest guarantee of victory in the war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Attempting to Cross the Wenzaobang Were Fiercely Attacked by Our Forces and Are on the Verge of Collapse</h3>
<p>Our Positions in Zhabei and Jiangwan Remain Unchanged; Enemy Suffers Significant Losses Near Luodian and Liuhang</p>
<p>A Central News Agency military reporter reported at 8:30 PM on the 6th that a large number of enemy troops were gathering in the Dongyangzhai and Jiangjiazhai areas on the north bank of the Wenzaobang, attempting to cross the river and invade aggressively. For several days, they have been fiercely bombarding the south bank with aircraft and artillery. Before dawn today, a unit forcibly crossed the river. Our troops stationed in Yanjiawan took advantage of their unstable position and launched an encirclement attack. By noon, they had been repelled, but not completely wiped out. At 3:00 PM, the enemy sent reinforcements again, and fierce fighting resumed. A small group of enemy troops, due to our pressure, fled westward, covering the crossing of another part of their force near the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. Fortunately, we discovered this and immediately launched a head-on attack. As of the time of the report, fighting was taking place in all three locations. The enemy, stubbornly defending along the river, is on the verge of collapse, while our reinforcements are arriving continuously. The remnants of the enemy can soon be repelled and wiped out.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Zhabei and Jiangwan All Day</h3>
<p>At around 8:30 PM last night (the 6th), our troops rushed out of Qiujiang Road. There were many puppet troops in the northeast of that area. Our troops used hand grenades to fight, resulting in the destruction of two enemy machine guns in that area. Taking advantage of the victory, they rushed to North Sichuan Road. The enemy troops were terrified and used several tanks to cover a quick retreat. The fighting was very fierce. At around 9:00 PM, our troops safely retreated to their original positions. At around 11:00 PM, the enemy troops bombarded our positions on Qiujiang Road with artillery, firing many shells, but none of them hit their targets. Our troops remained steadfast and suffered no losses.</p>
<p>At around 9:00 PM last night (the 6th), enemy artillery positions in the Hongkou area fired at Fangjia Wooden Bridge. At around 10:00 PM, more than 100 enemy troops from the No. 63 Flower Garden launched an assault on our positions from the east of Bazibridge. Our troops launched a head-on attack on Liuying Road, killing more than 20 enemy troops. The enemy's attempt completely failed, and they retreated in disarray.</p>
<p>Skirmish at Chizhi University</p>
<p>A Central News Agency military reporter reported at 8:30 PM on the 6th: ㊀ The enemy continues to bombard our positions in Jiangwan and Zhabei with artillery and aircraft, but the positions remain unchanged. ㊁ There is enemy activity 100 meters in front of our guard line at Yejia Flower Garden, Fudan University, but there has been no contact. ㊂ There was a skirmish in the Chizhi University area. ㊃ The enemy is constantly bombarding our Bazibridge area, using 15-centimeter howitzer shells.</p>
<p>Two-Pronged Attack Foiled</p>
<p>A Central News Agency military reporter reported at 8:30 PM on the 6th that enemy troops on North Sichuan Road launched a two-pronged attack at noon, advancing from Dongbaoxing Road and Fusheng Road. As the outposts approached, our troops rose up to fight. The enemy relied on the cover of tanks and repeatedly pressed forward, but our small cannons and hand grenades also unleashed great power. The battle continued until 4:00 PM, becoming even more intense. Our troops advanced bravely, bathing in blood, and finally repelled the enemy by dusk.</p>
<p>Dragon Clothes Launched Encirclement, Annihilating Many Enemies</p>
<p>A Central News Agency military reporter reported at 1:00 PM on the 6th that 200-300 enemy troops on North Sichuan Road, under the cover of tanks, launched an attack from Dongbaoxing Road at 3:30 AM. Our troops calmly responded to the attack. Suddenly, civilian houses behind our positions caught fire. Because we were unable to put out the fire, it spread very quickly. Our troops could not stay in the flames for long and immediately moved to the left and right. The enemy thought we had retreated and rushed to attack. Seeing that a part of the enemy had rushed past, we rose up and attacked, encircling them. A total of more than 70 enemies were annihilated in the two places, and three light machine guns and many rifles were captured. There were many puppet troops with Northern accents among the enemy troops in that area.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle in Luodian and Liuhang</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Actually Use Poison Gas</p>
<p>Enemy South of Luodian Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>There has been fierce fighting near Luodian for several days. The enemy has repeatedly attacked our northern position at the Shixianggong Temple. After being repelled by our troops, yesterday 1,000 enemy troops, under the cover of 30 tanks and armored vehicles, attacked again. After contact with the outposts, the enemy relied on superior weapons and stubbornly advanced, constructing fortifications about 600 meters in front of our positions and holding their ground against us. To the south of Luodian, a part of the enemy crossed the Shanghai-Taicang Highway and went deep into the west, an isolated force. We divided our troops to attack them from the side, encircling them. The enemy panicked and desperately tried to break through the encirclement and escape, but suffered heavy casualties. Few survived, and even their captain died in the chaos. Our troops searched the positions, capturing more than 10 enemy troops alive, and intercepting three light machine guns and many rifles. According to reports, the enemy, having failed in several attacks and running out of ideas, actually used poison gas bombs. However, the type of gas is still under investigation.</p>
<p>Countless Enemies Killed in Guangfu Town</p>
<p>Yesterday, a soldier from a certain unit was wounded at the front line in Guangfu Town, Liuhang, and was sent to Shanghai for treatment. According to his description of the battle, starting at dawn this morning (the 6th), the enemy greatly reinforced their forces, attacking our positions near Guangfu Town from the west of Liuhang, Zhoujia'an and Yaojiazhai, in two routes. At the same time, they used tanks and heavy artillery to cover their advance. Several enemy aircraft were also constantly bombing the positions in the air. The enemy's momentum was unprecedented. At that time, our troops concentrated their forces and calmly responded to the attack. As soon as the enemy approached, they used machine guns to sweep and heavy artillery to bombard, meeting the attack with all their strength. The enemy still charged forward, one after another. Our troops, seeing the opportunity, rushed out of the trenches and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, displaying extreme bravery. Although under the heavy impact of the enemy's heavy weapons, they still bravely advanced, without fear. After about two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy began to retreat. Our troops killed countless enemies, destroyed one tank, and captured many spoils of war abandoned by the enemy. We also suffered some casualties in this battle, but we are still firmly defending our original positions.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bomb Almost Daily</h3>
<p>Zhabei Suffers the Most Bombing, Qibao Particularly Devastated; Nanxiang Town a Scene of Devastation, 60 Dead and Wounded</p>
<p>Zhabei</p>
<p>Several enemy aircraft were active over Zhabei from 5:00 AM to about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, dropping many heavy bombs on Baoxing Road, Liuying Road, Zhongshan Road, and other places, causing considerable damage to local civilian houses. Later, they were driven away in disarray by our troops' heavy machine gun fire. In addition, five large single-winged aircraft dropped bombs near the railway line west of the Jiangwan Racecourse. The vicinity of Dachang was also bombed by Japanese aircraft, which did not stop until noon. At the intersection of Le'an Road, North Sichuan Road, Qiujiang Road, and Xingtie Road, the railway east of the Commercial Press factory and the railway west of the North Station were subjected to heavy artillery fire, with more than 300 shells landing. At around 8:30 AM, a shell fell inside the open space of the Yu Qiaqing Road Fire Company, but fortunately it did not explode, so there was no damage. At around 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM, Japanese aircraft bombed the vicinity of Zhabei and Jiangwan Town again. The artillery fire about one mile west of the North Station did not stop until late at night. Fortunately, the weather was dark and drizzly yesterday, making it difficult for the enemy aircraft to identify targets, so the bombs they dropped did not hinder our important projects.</p>
<p>Western Shanghai</p>
<p>In the Western Shanghai area, eight enemy aircraft also carried out heavy bombing after 8:00 AM yesterday morning, dropping more than 40 bombs, causing considerable casualties among civilians in Beixinjing and nearby villages. At 3:50 PM, six enemy aircraft flew to Qibao Town in Western Shanghai again, first dropping two heavy bombs that hit the roof of Yang Dingyuan's cotton ginning factory on Datang North Street. The force of the explosions was fierce, and more than 30 factory buildings and surrounding city houses were destroyed. 21 cotton ginning machines and three motors were completely damaged. Two old stewards were crushed to death on the spot. A female servant in the house was injured. The wife of Yang Yunjian, a neighboring tailor, had her head blown off and died. Several other people, including Yang Borong's wife, were injured by shrapnel. At that time, the town's noon market had not yet dispersed, and the villagers, unaware of the danger, gathered on the bridge to look up, causing them to be spotted by the enemy aircraft, which flew low again and dropped a bomb on the bridge. The explosion on the spot turned dozens of shops on the north and south sides of the bridge into ruins, including Ding Fuji, Yida Feng, Dong Yongxing Old Restaurant, Baosheng Tang, Cheng Baoxiang, Hengshan Tang, and Zhu Yongyu. In an instant, blood and flesh flew everywhere, a horrifying sight. Afterwards, the town's rescue team was dispatched in full force, first shipping more than 20 seriously injured people to Shanghai for treatment. 13 bodies that were dug out were buried one after another, but according to the townspeople's speculation, there are still many bodies buried on the banks of the river that have not been discovered.</p>
<p>Nanxiang</p>
<p>Nanxiang Town was bombed by enemy aircraft more than ten times, causing the entire town, including South Street and North Street, to become a scene of devastation. However, the residents and shops have already fled. Ji Wang Temple, which was originally a temporary market, was also bombed yesterday morning. Malu Town, 12 li north of Nanxiang, was bombed three times in the past few days, destroying almost all of the villagers' houses, and there were reports of 60 deaths and injuries among the villagers.</p>
<h3>Our Aviation Soldiers Contribute More Than Money</h3>
<p>Pledging to Purchase 200,000 Yuan in National Salvation Bonds</p>
<p>The Aviation Commission believes that the full-scale war of resistance is related to the survival of the nation, and that contributing money and effort is the duty of every citizen. The air force officers have always been enthusiastic about patriotism and will not lag behind in contributing. Therefore, they first pledged to purchase 200,000 yuan in national salvation bonds, and have sent a letter to the General Association for Solicitation. The General Association stated that the air force officers have a deep understanding of the righteousness of the cause, and in addition to defending the territory and eliminating stubborn enemies, they are also actively contributing, which can be a model for the entire country. The people in the rear should therefore consider how to contribute their financial, human, and material resources to feel less ashamed in their conscience.</p>
<h3>Enemy Breakthrough at Yuanping Foiled</h3>
<p>Fierce Four-Pronged Assault Results in Hand-to-Hand Combat; Still Under Our Troops' Tight Encirclement; Eighth Route Army Repeatedly Inflicts Heavy Damage on the Enemy; Takes Advantage of Victory to Advance in Another Direction</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] After being surrounded by our forces on the 5th, the enemy troops at Yuanping repeatedly attempted to break through, but all failed. On the evening of the 5th, more than ten enemy aircraft flew in shifts, attempting to cover the breakthrough of the trapped troops, but all were repelled by our air force. The enemy, cut off from supplies, was extremely fearful. That night, they launched a fierce four-pronged assault, resulting in hand-to-hand combat with our forces. The fighting was extremely fierce. The enemy suffered 500-600 dead and wounded. The remaining enemy troops are still under our troops' tight encirclement, and their remnants will be completely eliminated within days. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] After the Eighth Route Army recovered Shuoxian and Pinglu, their morale was even higher. The vanguard troops are now taking advantage of the victory to actively advance in another direction, and new developments will be made within days. Since the Eighth Route Army began operating in northern Shanxi, they have been displaying their expertise in guerrilla warfare, with elusive movements and rapid advances and retreats. Every time they attack the enemy, the enemy cannot grasp their movements, becoming exhausted from running around and suffering heavy losses. Our side has repeatedly achieved miraculous results. Most of the northern Shanxi front has now moved to Yanmen Pass, while the Eighth Route Army is still operating outside the pass, which has its own special strategic significance. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Twenty-two enemy heavy and light bombers flew in from the southwest at 10:00 AM on the 6th, seemingly intending to attack the capital. Upon receiving the report, our air force immediately dispatched planes to intercept them. While the enemy planes were flying in Anhui territory, eleven suddenly diverted to Raoqing, while the other eleven headed straight for Nanjing. The enemy and our forces met over Jurong, and an engagement ensued. Amidst the chaos, seven enemy light bombers took the opportunity to intrude into Nanjing's airspace, rampaging in the vicinity of Dajiaochang. As they flew over Tongji Gate, our anti-aircraft guns and cannons opened fire fiercely and simultaneously. One enemy light bomber was hit, emitting a plume of yellow smoke and plummeting downwards. Those who witnessed the scene cheered. The enemy plane crashed into a pond near Dajiaochang. The pilot and a combatant inside were killed instantly.

Our forces went to intercept them, engaging the enemy in the vicinity of Jurong. Seeing that there was no opportunity to exploit, the enemy planes detoured from the southeast to the suburbs of Nanjing, dropping over ten bombs near Dajiaochang. They then appeared to be advancing towards Nanjing's airspace. After being fired upon by our anti-aircraft guns and cannons, the enemy planes retreated, and our planes pursued and caught up, resulting in an engagement. After about fifteen minutes, both sides were wounded and crashed. The personnel in our plane sustained minor injuries, and the fuselage was slightly damaged, but it is still repairable.

<h3>He Chengjun Resigns from Acting Chairman of Hubei</h3>
<p>[Hankou] The Executive Yuan meeting on the 5th resolved to appoint He Chengjun to concurrently serve as the acting chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government. Currently, He believes that although Wuhan is not a war zone, the local relations are important, and one person's energy is limited, making it difficult to concurrently serve. He specifically telegraphed President Chiang requesting the appointment of another capable person. The original telegram is as follows: Urgent to Chiang Chung-cheng of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing. Oral reports say the Executive Yuan meeting on the 5th resolved that Hubei Provincial Government Chairman Huang Shaohong is leaving office on official business. Before returning to his post, all chairman duties are to be concurrently performed by He Chengjun. Since the start of the war of resistance, although Wuhan is not a war zone, local relations are important and complicated, no different from the front lines. One person's energy is limited, making it difficult to concurrently serve as provincial administrator, leading to trivial matters. If there are places where military affairs require the performance of duty, I would not hesitate to face fire and water. I recall that when I earnestly resigned from concurrently serving as administrator of Hubei Province in the 21st year, I explained to you that I did not wish to bear political responsibility again. I dare to ask you to understand my foolish sincerity, withdraw the order, and appoint another capable person. Boundless gratitude. Employee He Chengjun kowtows. (6th) Printed specifically.

<h3>Last Month's Fierce Battle at Liuhang: Our Four Battalion Commanders Sacrificed Themselves Heroically</h3>
<p>Noble Loyalty Will Forever Be Recorded in History</p>
<p>In the middle of last month, the enemy launched a full-scale attack on Liuhang, attempting to implement a central breakthrough strategy to shake our entire line. On the 13th, 14th, and 15th, the enemy launched two fierce attacks against us, and the fighting was extremely fierce. Our army bravely resisted and calmly responded, and the enemy soldiers were repelled. The enemy suffered very heavy casualties in this battle, and we also suffered considerable losses. Yang Shilu, Chen Hongyuan, Yang Jiucun, and Geng Mingtang, the four battalion commanders of our ××× Division, who were responsible for that line, all sacrificed themselves. Now, we have learned the detailed course of the battle of the Yang and Geng battalions and the brief biographies of the two battalion commanders as follows:</p>
<p>Details of the Battle</p>
<p>From September 13th to 15th, when the enemy was fiercely attacking our defense line in the Liuhang area, Battalion Commander Yang Shilu of the × Division led his troops to defend the approximately 600-meter section of the position from the southern end of Liduan to Ganxiantou. The enemy carried out intensive artillery bombardment more than three times a day, bombarding our position in general, followed by infantry charges. When the Northern Army emerged from the trenches and bravely intercepted and killed them, they turned back and fled, not daring to look back. Therefore, although we fought fiercely for two days and nights, we had not yet achieved a larger victory. Battalion Commander Shi deeply felt that it was not a good plan to just be attacked by the enemy's artillery without achieving a large number of kills. Therefore, when the enemy's artillery bombarded, he deployed most of his troops on both wings, leaving only a few enemy soldiers to resist in the middle. When the enemy soldiers charged, our front feigned a retreat, luring the enemy deep. The two wings surrounded the enemy. The enemy knew they had been tricked, and it was too late to retreat. In the close combat, more than 200 were killed or wounded by us. The enemy retaliated, and at 5:00 PM on the 15th, they launched a fierce attack on us with planes and artillery, followed by an infantry charge twice as large as before, covered by tanks. Yang ordered the officers and soldiers to remain calm and wait, and at the same time ordered the pistol soldiers of each company to fire their pistols into the tank's observation holes when the tanks were within 20 meters. Several tank drivers were shot dead by us, and the remaining tanks fled in a panic before their mission was completed. At this time, the officers and soldiers of the battalion and the fourth transport officers and soldiers who were temporarily attached to the battalion had come out of the trenches to meet and kill the enemy. After an hour of melee, about 300 enemies were killed. Finally, due to the enemy's numerical superiority over us, Battalion Commander Yang was shot and killed on the battlefield. The officers and soldiers of the battalion also made a heroic sacrifice. Fortunately, our reinforcements arrived in time and repelled the enemy. The battle fought by one battalion led by Battalion Commander Geng was fought on the afternoon of September 13th at 1:00 PM, when our army was attacking and advancing and was surrounded by the enemy. Battalion Commander Geng led his troops to reinforce the enemy's fierce attack from the mountain side, killing more than 100 enemies on the spot. The enemy then increased reinforcements and more than ten tanks, using the fierce cover of artillery fire. The battalion commander still fought bravely against the enemy, charging six or seven times, and sacrificed himself for the country east of Xiaosongzhai.</p>
<p>Brief Biographies of Yang and Geng</p>
<p>㊀ Battalion Commander Yang Shiyuan, courtesy name Chongli, was from Qianxian County, Shaanxi. He was tall and majestic, concise and taciturn, sincere and amiable to people, and served the public with loyalty, courage, and diligence. Therefore, since he served as a platoon leader, company commander, and battalion and regimental adjutant, he has been deeply trusted by his superiors and loved by his subordinates. ㊁ Battalion Commander Geng Mingtang, courtesy name Jianzhou, was 32 years old, from Xuchang, Henan. He graduated from the Central Infantry Academy and served as a platoon leader, staff officer, and battalion adjutant. He was the battalion commander of × Battalion, ×× Regiment, ×× Division.</p>

<h3>The International Friendship Society Held Its Inaugural Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mayor Yu Delivered a Sincere Speech</p>
<p>The International Friendship Society, initiated by local leaders Liu Zhan'en, Xu Xinliu, Zou Bingwen, Zhu Shaoping, and others, held its inaugural meeting at the International Hotel at 12:15 PM yesterday. Over a hundred people from all walks of life attended, including consuls general from Britain, France, Russia, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and Norway, presidents of various foreign chambers of commerce, special correspondents from major European and American newspapers stationed in Shanghai, editors-in-chief and general managers of major Chinese and Western newspapers in the area, and general managers of various banks and major companies. Liu Zhan'en first delivered an opening speech and reported on the preparations. Mayor Yu then delivered a speech on the significance of the establishment of the International Friendship Society. The meeting then passed the charter, changed the annual membership fee from two yuan to five yuan, and changed the number of directors from seven to nine. Officers were then elected. Chen Heqin, Nasq, and Luccock were nominated as members of the board of directors. The nominating committee nominated Liu Zhan'en, Xu Xinliu, Zhu Shaoping, Dai Baoliu, W. C. Cassels of HSBC, W. H. Plant, president of the American Chamber of Commerce, Breal, president of the French Havas News Agency, Krug I, a German pastor, and Romolo Angelone, commercial counselor of the Italian Embassy, as the nine directors. The motion passed unanimously. The first board meeting was then held to discuss various matters and stipulated that a member luncheon will be held on the first Wednesday of each month. The main purpose is to enhance the feelings of Chinese and foreign people. Mayor Yu's speech is as follows:</p>
<p>I am deeply honored to be invited to speak at the opening of your society today. The establishment of the International Friendship Society in the cosmopolitan city of Shanghai is fitting and gratifying. As far as Hongjun knows, the purpose of your society is to use the members of the society to enhance mutual international understanding, and to conduct frank and fair discussions on world affairs, so as to form a true and unfeigned public opinion in the world. I, Hongjun, am humble, but I believe that the establishment of your society today is in line with the times. In the history of the Far East, there is no greater need for pure public opinion than today. Some believe that public opinion can be manufactured by human power to fit one's own illusions. This is a big mistake. True public opinion is a natural expression of mankind condemning evildoers, which cannot be manufactured by human power. When the actions between people or between countries violate justice, this true public opinion will not condone it and will unanimously condemn it. At that time, no force in the world can stop it. The various barbaric acts of the Japanese army, navy, and air force in China's territory, which are now rampant and unscrupulous, have aroused public outrage all over the world, which is clear evidence. The Tokyo government has spent countless amounts of money on domestic and foreign propaganda, especially focusing on foreign countries, printing books, sending secret envoys to lobby, and propaganda materials that are constantly being sent, reaching everywhere from Europe and America to the whole world, leaving no stone unturned, in order to penetrate the hearts of the people and divert their attention. To achieve its deliberate attempt to conquer and rule China. However, facts speak louder than words, and the result is nothing more than that the speakers are earnest and the listeners are disdainful. Japan has repeatedly denied that Japanese aircraft bombard cities without military facilities, drop bombs in civilian residential areas, and strafe pedestrians on the road. It also refuses to admit that its submarines have deafened and attacked our fishing boats, and allowed our innocent fishermen to drift and freeze to death in the distant sea. It even said that the Japanese Imperial Army would never do such inhumane things. The eyewitness testimony of impartial people from friendly countries has even been falsely accused of being Chinese propaganda, and they want to cover up the world's eyes with one hand. However, justice is in the hearts of the people, and the world cannot be deceived. True public opinion will eventually have its way of expressing itself. Otherwise, why would the League of Nations General Assembly unanimously condemn it, the great powers unanimously protest, the British people unanimously express outrage, British religious groups unanimously call for a halt, the British Labour Party urge the government to impose sanctions, the Indian people express indignation, workers in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand refuse to unload Japanese loans, the American people march and demonstrate, and the newspapers in France, the United States, and the world unanimously scold Japanese aircraft for disregarding humanity? Is it under someone's instructions? All of this cannot be achieved by force. Only public opinion can achieve it. The fact that twenty-one countries in the world unanimously condemn Japan's atrocities means that their condemnation must be fair. This is what everyone present should keep in mind. The oppressed public opinion in Japan knows the danger of the warlords' policies, but unfortunately, public opinion is often held hostage by violence. It is difficult for the Japanese people themselves to believe that economic cooperation and true friendship with China can be achieved by arson and murder. However, there is nothing they can do. The war that is undeclared is now in progress. The Japanese aggression will not stop for a day, and this war will not stop for a day. China is fighting for self-defense and to defend its territory. The Chinese government knows the magnitude of its responsibility and the arduousness of its work. Any sacrifices that an independent and self-respecting country should make in the same situation, any sacrifices, the Chinese government and the Chinese people have made without hesitation. Ready to sacrifice. With the flames of war raging and strong enemies in front of us, we firmly believe that unity and unity are enough to overcome the difficulties. Indeed, China will suffer a great calamity, an unprecedented great calamity. However, we are happy to do so, to drive out foreign invaders for China and to maintain humanity for the world. Therefore, China's war of resistance is not fighting for itself alone. Lord Cranborne of England has made it clear at the League of Nations General Assembly that the behavior of Japanese aircraft in China is obviously a great harm to the whole world. He asked the League of Nations in a solemn manner, "If this kind of behavior continues unabated, or becomes even more serious, can civilization itself exist?" US Secretary of State Hull also announced that the US government, in accordance with its protest to Tokyo on September 22, believed that the indiscriminate bombing of peaceful professionals in densely populated areas by Japanese aircraft was a great violation of international justice and human morality. The French representative Dalbozzi said that "If the League of Nations remains silent, it is tantamount to conspiring with Japan. If the people of the world do not act according to their conscience and unanimously condemn it, civilization itself will be in danger. We must always remember the good words of our Chinese friends that saving China depends on the Chinese people themselves. However, at a time when the entire world's civilization and human happiness are deeply threatened, people from all countries should know the danger of standing aside and isolating themselves. This article is self-explanatory without me having to say more.</p>

<h3>American Women's Groups Telegraph the US to Oppose Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>Also telegraphed Madame Chiang, expressing sympathy for our country</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reports that the Shanghai American Women's Association and the American Association of University Women jointly telegraphed President Roosevelt's wife on Wednesday, hoping that the United States would lead the countries to stop Japan's aggression against China. The two groups met on Wednesday morning at the office of the American Women's Association in Jing'an Temple to discuss the association's work in relieving the victims of the war and other matters, and then decided to send the telegram. The telegram expressed shock and pain at the bombing of non-combatants, even affecting women and children, by Japanese aircraft. Similar telegrams were sent to the American Association of University Women, the American Association of University Women, and the League of Women Voters. A reply telegram was sent to Madame Chiang Kai-shek, expressing sympathy for China and informing her that four telegrams had been sent to the United States. During the meeting, it was also stated that the American Women's Association was willing to assist the Chinese Women's Association in making bandages and bedding. Several weeks ago, the association had expressed this sympathy to the Chinese Women's Association.</p>
<h3>A Group of American僑 Scheduled to Return Home</h3>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident, many American 僑 in Shanghai have left Shanghai and returned to their countries one after another. It is reported that there are still some American 僑 who voluntarily leave Shanghai and plan to take the American transport ship Shawmont, which will sail to Japan on the 19th, and then transfer to an American merchant ship to return to the United States.</p>
<h3>A Prisoner Sheds Bitter Tears</h3>
<p>Hoping there will be no more fighting, longing to return to his hometown and work as a shop assistant again.</p>
<p>A military reporter from the Central News Agency, in Zhabei, encountered a captured enemy soldier from the Japanese army. His tragic experience aroused the reporter's sympathy.</p>
<p>His name is Kato Saichi, a soldier from Sasebo, Japan, twenty-six years old this year. He worked as a clerk in a small shop. In Showa 8 (1933), he had already been discharged from the army. This time, due to the military emergency, he was drafted back into the army. On September 16th, he departed from Sasebo and arrived in Shanghai on the 18th, assembling at the Japanese naval headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. On the night of September 28th, he participated in the battle, attacking our positions from Guangdong Street. He was knocked down by our army's fierce hand grenade, exploding in the corner of a girls' school. His forehead and left cheek were injured, and he fainted there. When he woke up, he was alone. However, our troops did not find him either. He hid in the corner, afraid to move. Day after day passed, until the evening of October 4th, when he was so hungry that he could no longer bear it. He tried to crawl out of the corner and escape from there, but he was captured by our army at the entrance.</p>
<p>He stood wearily before Chief of Staff Zhang, barely able to stand. The Chief asked him to sit down. He was very thirsty and drank a lot of hot tea. His face was covered with a thick, black, long beard, which matched his dust-covered cloth shoes very well. The Chief first asked him to talk about his background. His tears fell. His voice was so low and heavy. He said:</p>
<p>'I am a small businessman. My mother is old, and our family is not well-off. My younger brother and younger sister's family all depend on my small monthly salary as a shop assistant in a small shop to make a living. Now that I am out here, I don't know how they will survive.' His eyelids were soaked with hot tears. I knew he was thinking of his family, his old mother, younger brother, and younger sister, especially his beloved wife whom he had just married. He showed us a photo of his beloved wife, and said:</p>
<p>'I only got married this June. It's really not easy for us small businessmen to get married. My beloved wife can really endure hardship. I don't know how she will live in the future.' We praised the beauty of his wife. He shook his head and sighed a long, bone-chilling sigh. The amulets he carried must have been given to him by his old mother and newlywed wife, containing the deepest sadness of life. His mother and wife must be burning incense day and night, blessing him.</p>
<p>Chief Zhang asked him about his feelings about the war. He said that he was just a private first class and didn't know much. He only knew that unfortunate news of his acquaintances kept coming. He himself didn't know when his life would end. He felt fortunate to have become a prisoner, as there was still a glimmer of hope for survival. He said that no one knew why they were fighting China. It was probably because the diplomacy was not handled well, leading to the war between the two countries. His only hope was that there would be no more fighting, so that he could return to his hometown and work as a shop assistant again, so that his family could survive.</p>
<p>His plea and his tears moved each of us very much. But the sound of artillery outside was booming, and the enemy's evil hands were dancing there. Alas, the Japanese warlords are truly executioners of humanity.</p>
<h3>What is Ito Doing in Shanghai?</h3>
<p>Westerners have seen through his intentions. Empty words are of no use, only a wasted trip.</p>
<p>It is widely rumored that Mr. Ito, a Japanese diplomat out of office, and his entourage, who came to Shanghai to engage in activities with leaders of European and American countries, set sail from Kobe on the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru via Moji and Nagasaki and arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 6th) at 7:00 AM, berthing at the Waibaidu Bridge Wharf. High-ranking Japanese officials all went to the port to welcome them. It is known to the world that violent Japan is running rampant. Knowledgeable people in Europe and America will never be fooled by them. It is expected that Ito and his party's visit here will only be a wasted trip.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ship Carrying Ningbo Passengers to Shanghai Blocked by the Enemy</h3>
<p>Stating that if they bring passengers again next time, they must disembark at the Waibaidu Bridge Wharf.</p>
<p>The Endeavor, a ship of the China-Italy Shipping Company, had over seven hundred passengers returning to Shanghai from Ningbo. When the ship arrived in Shanghai, it docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf. As the passengers were about to disembark, the authorities of the International Settlement, because they were currently sending refugees away from Shanghai, and people from the mainland should not come to Shanghai again, blocked the passengers from disembarking and ordered the ship to return to Ningbo. From 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM, various circles in Ningbo in Shanghai proved to the authorities of the International Settlement that most of the passengers were merchants, and after negotiations, they were finally allowed to disembark. The passengers waited on the ship until 8:00 PM in the evening before they were able to disembark. Unexpectedly, the enemy naval authorities suddenly notified the Italian Consulate yesterday, stating that if the Endeavor carries passengers from Ningbo to Shanghai again next time, they will not be allowed to sail to the Jinliyuan Wharf to disembark, and must disembark at the Waibaidu Bridge Wharf. From today onwards, Ningbo ships will no longer be able to carry passengers to Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Public Welfare Association of the Ministry of Communications and Telecommunications staff on Luming Road in this city has always worked extremely hard for the cause of resisting the enemy and saving the country. For example, they have donated more than 20,000 yuan to aid Ma Zhanshan's former 19th Route Army, the Northeast Volunteer Army, and the soldiers resisting the enemy in Suiyuan. Now that the government has issued national salvation bonds, the association has not only advised members in various places to do their best to purchase them, but has also subscribed to 10,000 yuan themselves, and has remitted the funds to the Ministry of Communications, requesting them to purchase the bonds on their behalf.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Woolen Fabric Factory Trade Association recently established a National Salvation Bond Woolen Fabric Factory Sub-Team. In addition to subscribing to 10,000 yuan of bonds on the spot, they will continue to make efforts to solicit subscriptions separately.</p>
<h3>Three Soldiers Awarded for Heroically Defending Their Position</h3>
<p>A sorrowful army will surely win; the future of the war of resistance is bright.</p>
<p>After the enemy forces invaded and occupied Liuhang Town and continuously replenished their forces, they recently advanced north and south along the Liuhang-Guangfu Highway, attacking our positions in Wujiazhai and Zhangjiazhai. The enemy's offensive was fierce and they once advanced to Zhangjiazhai, but they were repelled by our reinforcements and the original positions were restored. On the south side of Lujiazhai, the fighting was also extremely fierce. Our army fought bravely, but the enemy's artillery fire was intense and our army suffered heavy casualties. In the end, only one company commander and four soldiers remained to defend the position, using machine guns to sweep the enemy, preventing them from advancing. Soon, the company commander was also wounded by gunfire and one soldier escorted him away. The remaining three soldiers remained calm and dealt with the situation, and eventually fresh troops arrived to reinforce them, repelling the enemy. The bravery of the three soldiers in defending their territory to the death has been recognized and commended by their superiors.</p>

<h3>The Attitude of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>I remember that former US Secretary of State Stimson had a sentence in his book 'The Crisis in the Far East'. 'Aggression is a fire. If it is not put out, it will spread from one place to the whole world.'</p>
<p>Indeed. This raging fire spread from the Four Northeastern Provinces to Abyssinia. From Abyssinia to Spain. Now it is raging on our continent. Making the peace-loving countries of the world very anxious.</p>
<p>The League of Nations, in nature, was originally a world 'fire brigade'. Whenever there was a fire alarm, it never used its full strength to put it out. Therefore, the fire is getting more and more intense.</p>
<p>Recently, the League of Nations Advisory Committee finally passed a resolution. Even the words 'aggression' and 'war' were absolutely avoided. This shows that, because of its concern for the arsonist, it was unwilling to directly say that it was a fire, lest it provoke its own obligation to put out the fire.</p>
<p>The League of Nations has adopted such a timid attitude. This is clearly due to the complacency of some politicians who control this institution. To make them overcome this mentality, we still need to intensify our efforts in diplomacy.</p>

<h3>German Consul-General Kindt Expresses Deep Sympathy for China</h3>
<p>Xu Qiao, a resident of Shanghai, holds a harvest thanksgiving celebration every year in mid-October. On the 3rd of this month, the German community in Shanghai held a celebration at the German School at No. 1 Daxilu in this city. Mr. Kindt, the German Consul-General in Shanghai, personally participated and delivered a speech. His speech expressed deep sympathy for our country, saying that in this Far East war, as far as the Germans are concerned, although there is an obligation to maintain a neutral stance, this cannot prevent the Germans from expressing their sympathetic feelings to the friendly countries and their people in their personal capacity. This obligation of neutrality cannot prevent the Germans from being friends of this nation. He has been an official here for decades and considers this his second hometown, so he has a very clear understanding of it and extremely deep sympathy. The Germans have made some contributions to various undertakings in China and do not want to see their harvests destroyed by artillery fire. Their sympathy for the people of their friendly neighbors is only natural.</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Appeals to the United States to Implement a Boycott of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Implementing a boycott of Japan can make the aggressor yield. Sanctions for the sake of justice and righteousness are an unavoidable duty. Delivered a broadcast speech to the American people yesterday.</p>
<p>Dr. Shi Zhaoji, our country's former ambassador to the United States, delivered a radio speech to the American people on the international radio station in this city at 7:00 AM yesterday morning (the 6th), urging the American people to boycott Japanese goods. The full text of Shi's speech is translated as follows:</p>
<p>A few days ago, I made a statement to the press, informing my American friends that my country's expectations of your country are deeper than those of any other country. The traditional friendship between China and Japan has closely linked the two countries. This statement has been conveyed to you by news agencies of various countries. This morning at 7:00 (Shanghai time), I repeat my country's expectations of the people of your country. In our history, whenever my country has encountered great difficulties, the people of your country have always expressed sympathy. Therefore, I am now appealing to the people of your country again. Here, amidst the intense artillery fire and the rumbling of airplanes, I have witnessed thousands of wounded soldiers and civilians panting in the rear hospitals. I have no hesitation in saying that our war of resistance is a war of resistance for survival. Based on my experience studying in your country and serving as my country's ambassador to your country, I am convinced that the people of your country have always upheld justice and will be able to give my country full sympathy. This incident is like a fire breaking out in your neighbor's house. Whether it is arson or an accidental occurrence, you will definitely consider it unfortunate. I firmly believe that you will fulfill your responsibility as good neighbors and rise up to help China. Indeed, I believe that there are quite a few among you who are willing to provide my country with material assistance. The American Red Cross has generously donated a large sum of money to help the wounded soldiers and civilians. The first batch of medicines donated to my country by the Chinese Medical Association by the people of your country has arrived in my country. We are all deeply grateful. I urge you to continue to donate generously, because the number of wounded soldiers and civilians and homeless refugees is extremely large. God knows that we desperately need help. Now I have another very good plan to suggest to you. This is something that can be done by the rich, the poor, the old, the young, the noble and the lowly. What is the plan? That is to implement a boycott of Japan. If all the people in the world who uphold justice implement a boycott of Japan, even if it is an informal implementation, we can make the aggressor yield in a short period of time. You have the power to turn hostility into friendship. You can save millions of innocent people from being massacred. Quickly rise up to implement a boycott of Japan, and quickly persuade your friends who uphold justice to implement a boycott. Then the violent acts of aggression by Japan will definitely stop. Some people in your country advocate maintaining absolute neutrality and avoiding being drawn into the vortex of war. I am afraid that they will oppose my suggestion. If the cause and responsibility for the dispute are unclear, I will express sympathy with those who advocate maintaining neutrality. However, in this dispute, the facts are obvious. Who should be held responsible is also very clear. Now, which is the aggressor country and which is the victim of aggression? There is no doubt. Is this war the result of Japanese troops invading Chinese territory, or is it the result of Chinese troops invading Japanese territory? I have no intention of suggesting that your country should abandon its neutrality and send its army and navy to China to help China fight. I frankly tell you that people in my country are expressing doubts about the misinterpretation of the neutrality policy by some people in your country. Because if a country adopts a neutrality law without regard to the fact that one of the countries is an aggressor country, then the result will only benefit the aggressor country. For example, some people suggest that American missionaries in China should leave China and return to their country in order to implement the neutrality law. Because the presence of American missionaries in China can stimulate the national spirit of China and strengthen the morale of resistance. If the United States makes a law and implements it according to this scope, then the people of your country should think twice about whether there is a misinterpretation of your country's neutrality law. The people of my country have always respected your country's conservative neutrality and its intention to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. However, we still remember that your country is a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. Now, that treaty has been torn up by violent Japan. I believe that your country has a moral obligation to the violation of this treaty. I am extremely happy to see your country's reputation in China growing day by day. However, I must advise you that if a great country like the United States ignores the international treaty obligations that China deeply expects and adopts an extremely strict neutrality law, then your country's prestige will be swept away. If your neighbor's house is set on fire by bandits, will you turn a deaf ear to the cries for help from the victims? Will you stand by and treat the bandits and the law-abiding victims the same? You, as the people, should rise up and seek positive change. At the very least, you should stop all supplies to the bandits who have repeatedly looted houses. If you can do this, it will be a collective effort to sanction Japan. If it is successful, it will be a great contribution to history, and it can prove that power without justice as a backing is definitely not justice. You will usher in a new era, at which time justice and righteousness can overcome everything. It proves that the power of individuals can prevent a country's government from aggression and the rampant acts of militarists. We are now standing at the door of a great opportunity to create a new stage, and the power to succeed is in the hands of each of you in your country.</p>
<h3>Japanese Public Opinion Hopes to End the War Soon</h3>
<p>Gradually Feeling Doubt and Wavering Towards the Warlords' Militarism; High-Ranking Officials Question the Necessity of the War</p>
<p>Japanese newspapers that arrived in Shanghai on the 5th show that Japanese public opinion is gradually feeling doubt and wavering towards the future of the militarist policies being pursued by the warlords. An editorial in the Tokyo Shimbun on October 1st even proposed the demand to end the war soon, the main points of which are: ㊀ The Japanese government should prepare in advance to avoid repeating the Tokyo riots after the Russo-Japanese War. ㊁ Although a long-term war is not out of the question, it is not in Japan's interest or in the interest of East Asia. If possible, after the Shanghai war comes to an end, Japan can automatically use diplomatic means to end the war. ㊂ The government should not be bound by past statements and abandon territorial demands, and it seems possible to advocate ceding the eastern region to prevent war from breaking out again. ㊃ It is possible to demand compensation, etc. In addition, other newspapers also expressed dissatisfaction between the lines, stating that the Japanese army's operations in Shanghai were fruitless, and international criticism was pouring in. One newspaper even reported that high-ranking officials and financial circles have begun to question the military: ㊀ What is the necessity of the war? ㊁ How to clean up the mess? ㊂ Why can't the military respond to military opportunities, and military plans cannot be realized as scheduled? The Privy Council may even hold the military accountable, so the military hopes to find a solution before the opening of the regular Diet on December 25th this year.</p>
<h3>Business Community Task Force's National Day Bond Subscription Campaign</h3>
<p>The overall goal is 20 million yuan in national salvation bonds and 200,000 households in national salvation savings.</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Salvation Bond Business Community Task Force has decided on the following measures for the expansion of the National Day National Salvation Bond solicitation campaign in order to actively promote the solicitation of national salvation bonds: ㊀ The Kawamoto Task Force will prepare its national salvation bond subscription forms, weekly report forms, and employee national salvation savings subscription examination forms in advance and distribute them to various sub-teams. ㊁ All team leaders and members of each sub-team should unite with several member representatives and divide into at least ten groups, with each group consisting of several people, and depart in sections on National Day to solicit donations from door to door from their colleagues. ㊂ National salvation bonds: according to Article 8 of the solicitation method, those who have not subscribed should be persuaded to listen, and those who have subscribed should prepare to pay, fill in the weekly report form. ㊃ National salvation savings: according to Article 9 of the solicitation method, employees in the same industry with salaries above 90 yuan should subscribe to one-tenth of their monthly salary, and those with salaries below 50 yuan should subscribe freely, or follow the unified standards formulated by each front-line sub-team, and all monthly savings will be deducted by the business staff. Those who have not saved should be persuaded to fill in the subscription form, and those who have saved should be recorded in the examination form. ㊄ In order to carry out items 3 and 4, each sub-team should bring subscription weekly report forms and subscription examination forms when they depart in groups and fill them out from door to door. ㊅ The overall goal of this task force's solicitation on National Day is 10 million yuan in national salvation bonds and 200,000 households in national salvation savings, in order to match the significance of the Double Tenth. ㊆ Each sub-team should fairly assess and report the results of the solicitation to this task force, and those who subscribe enthusiastically and solicitation members with outstanding performance should also be specially reported to this task force for commendation. ㊇ If a sub-team completes the solicitation of bonds to be issued and savings to be paid on National Day, this task force will report to the solicitation headquarters and grant exceptional commendation. Those who do not complete the solicitation but have outstanding performance will be rewarded separately. ㊈ All staff members of this task force should depart separately on National Day to inspect the various sub-teams and examine the work situation. ㊉ This national law will be promulgated and implemented by this task force and reported to the solicitation headquarters for record. The women's group of the Shanghai Municipal National Salvation Bond Solicitation Task Force has decided to mobilize all members of various women's groups and female school students on the day of Double Tenth to dedicate a day's work to solicit donations from the women's community throughout the city and to publicize the significance of subscribing to national salvation bonds.</p>
<h3>Leaving a Name on a Cotton Vest Has Profound Significance</h3>
<p>Vegetable Stallholders Donate White Garments; Wouldn't Those Who Haven't Donated Be Scorned By Future Generations?</p>
<p>The Shanghai Comfort Committee has recently received an enthusiastic response from all parties in donating cotton vests. In order to encourage donations, those who donate 50 or more items will have their names printed on the lining of the cotton vests and published in the newspaper to promote their benevolence. Urgently needed first aid kits are also needed in the front lines, and donations are also hoped for. Each kit costs 10 cents and is available for sale at all pharmacies. They can be sent to Jingshi Nunnery on Guling Road, or the Cotton Fabric Association in Huajin Lane on Simalu, and other receiving agencies designated by the Comfort Committee.</p>
<p>Cheng Hongsheng and Wu Linsheng, staff members of the Xiaocai Market on Simalu, realizing that the cool breeze has already risen and the front lines need cotton clothing to protect themselves, especially solicited donations from the stallholders. In a short time, the stallholders of the market collected 100 items and sent them to the local association for collection and transfer. Since the vegetable vendors' daily income is meager, they have such enthusiasm. Cheng and Wu, in addition to their duties, also handle national salvation work, which is admirable. It is deeply hoped that those who have not donated will donate quickly, so as not to be laughed at by the vegetable sellers.</p>
<h3>Various Circles Enthusiastically Subscribe to Comfort Bags</h3>
<p>Since the First Special District Citizens' Federation negotiated with the Municipal Comfort Committee and launched a campaign to collect National Day commemorative comfort bags to comfort the soldiers resisting the enemy, various circles throughout the city have enthusiastically participated. Yesterday, the following circles subscribed to the association: Tianchu MSG Factory 1,000 bags, Guangdong Bank colleagues 250 bags, Zhu Wenjie and Ding Huikang raised 200 bags from British merchants Wantai Co., Ltd., Zhu Qizhen raised 200 bags from Li Caibao, Zhou Hongxiang 100 bags, Chen Dequan 100 bags, Lu Ziren and Pan Chunhua 100 bags, Sino-French Pharmacy 200 bags, Zhu He Cheng 100 bags, Zhu Shoutang raised 265 bags, Wang Shaoxian 200 bags, Fan Chunlin 100 bags, Lixin Silk Factory employees 100 bags, Xianzhong Dyeing Factory 100 bags, Xu Xinliu 100 bags, Yuan Ludeng 50 bags, Xu Xiangsun 100 bags, and many others with 50, 30, and several bags. In addition, the various district branches of the association have also subscribed to more than 5,000 bags. In order to facilitate subscriptions from various circles, those with more than 50 bags can notify the association and send staff with official receipts to contact them. The student community is also expanding solicitation for National Day comfort bags. Schools such as Kunfan, Siwen, and Zhenshi have all started to work.</p>
<h3>Preventing Enemy Acquisition of Gunny Sacks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lamo Gunny Sack Cloth Trade Association issued an urgent notice yesterday, stating: We have recently received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating, “The municipal government’s special order No. 1291 of September 27 stated that, in view of the fact that this city is in the midst of a war of resistance, all military-related commodities should be controlled in order to prevent aiding the enemy. It is hereby ordered that all merchants and shops should only supply military-related commodities to the official army. If they are sold at will, once discovered, they will be severely punished.” We have recorded the order and issued a notice accordingly, hoping that you will check and distribute it to your colleagues and abide by it together as the main matter. Upon receiving this, we have found that many of our colleagues have moved and we do not know their addresses, so we cannot notify them. Therefore, we have recorded the letter and published it in the newspaper as a notice, hoping that all of our colleagues will abide by it together.</p>
<h3>Dramatic Robbery Case on Maqi Road: Thief Kills Pedestrian</h3>

<p>At 10:40 AM on the 17th of last month, two robbers, one armed with a handgun, broke into a glutinous rice soy sauce shop on Maqi Road and robbed 80 yuan in cash. As the two robbers fled, the owner shouted loudly and several people gave chase. One of the unarmed robbers fled to Dongjing Road and was stopped by pedestrian Li Jiayu. The armed robber then fired at Li, hitting him in a vital area and killing him on the spot. The murderers fled without a trace. According to reports, the deceased Li Jiayu saw justice and acted bravely, resulting in his death for the public good, which is commendable. The police department has given his family 150 yuan in legal tender as compensation.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Opening of Schools by the Public Works Department</h3>

<h3>US State Department Officially Issues Declaration Condemning Japanese Aggression Against China</h3>
<p>Expressing Willingness to Participate in the London Pacific Conference; Determined to Cooperate with All Countries to Mediate the Far East Dispute</p>
<p>[Washington] The State Department today issued a declaration condemning Japanese aggression against China, pointing out that Japan's actions in China violate the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The article implicitly refers to today's League of Nations General Assembly meeting and continues by saying that since the current dispute in the Far East occurred, the US government has been strongly advising the Chinese and Japanese governments not to take hostile actions and has offered to both countries to work together to find mutually acceptable methods to peacefully mediate the overall situation in the Far East. The public believes that this move by the State Department has left no doubt that the US government intends to cooperate with the League of Nations to the best of its ability in the Far East crisis. (Central News Agency, 6th Reuters)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the meeting of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to discuss the disputes between China and Japan, the US State Department has not yet received an invitation. However, responsible parties have claimed that the US will undoubtedly participate in this meeting. They also said that the US's attitude towards acts that violate the treaty will be consistent with the League of Nations. This can be seen in President Roosevelt's speech yesterday. (Central News Agency, 6th Havas)</p>
<p>[Washington] After President Roosevelt delivered a speech in Chicago yesterday, US government officials recently stated that Secretary of State Hull had previously stated in a written statement on July 16 that the US should cooperate effectively with other countries to maintain peace. The President's speech yesterday was intended to educate public opinion and promote the acceptance of this cooperative policy. European public opinion now wants to know what measures the US government intends to take so that those who sit and talk can stand up and act. This is due to a lack of understanding of the US's national conditions. Indeed, the President's speech was a preliminary expression, and its intention was to make people understand the truth of the international situation and to enable all peace-loving countries to use the Nine-Power Treaty to achieve their goals through the League of Nations. Now that the front of peace-loving countries has been established, we can take further steps to seek joint action. (Central News Agency, 6th Havas)</p>
<h3>League of Nations General Assembly Passes Resolution on China-Japan Issue</h3>
<p>Representatives of Siam and Poland Abstain; Conference of Nine-Power Treaty Countries to be Convened Immediately</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations General Assembly met at 5:00 PM today to discuss the resolution on the disputes between China and Japan. Representatives of Norway and the Union of South Africa requested at yesterday's General Assembly to postpone the meeting for one day to consult their respective governments. After the meeting today, the representatives of the countries stated that they had received instructions from their governments and decided to vote in favor. At this point, the General Assembly passed the resolution proposed by the Advisory Committee on China-Japan Issues yesterday without debate by a unanimous vote (with only Poland and Siam abstaining) as a final decision. The Chairman, Indian representative Aga Khan, declared that he would take all necessary measures in accordance with this resolution. The General Assembly also decided to adjourn without closing in order to convene a meeting immediately when requested by the Advisory Committee. The Chairman then signed letters of invitation in accordance with the procedures outlined in the resolution in order to invite all member states that are signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty to hold a meeting as soon as possible in accordance with Article 7 of the Treaty. (Note: Article 9 of the Nine-Power Treaty stipulates that the contracting parties agree that whenever a situation arises that any one of the contracting parties believes involves the application of the provisions of this Treaty and is appropriate for discussion, the relevant contracting parties shall fully and frankly notify each other.) The member states of the League of Nations that are signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty include China, France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the British Empire, which includes the United Kingdom, Canada, the Union of South Africa, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, and India. In addition, there are five other countries that successively signed and joined after the Nine-Power Treaty was established: Bolivia, Denmark, Mexico, Norway, and Sweden. Therefore, the invitation letter from the Chairman of the General Assembly, Aga Khan, was sent to the governments of the aforementioned seventeen countries. Whether the two signatory countries of the non-member states, the United States and Japan, and the non-signatory country of the Soviet Union, will be invited will be decided by the aforementioned seventeen countries. The meeting place is likely to be London. After signing the invitation letter, Chairman Aga Khan delivered a short speech to conclude, roughly stating: "The main issue at present is the issue of humanity and human dignity. The suffering suffered by one nation must be felt by other nations. The weakening of one nation will inevitably lead to the weakening of other nations. Conversely, the progress of one nation will also be for the benefit of other nations. All of this is no longer an empty ideal but a compass that should be followed by the authorities of various countries and people of goodwill." (Central News Agency, 6th Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Well-informed sources in British political circles recently stated that the future Pacific Conference will soon be held in London. The United States will accept the invitation to participate, while Japan will definitely refuse to attend. As for the reason why the meeting place was chosen in London, it is because Geneva and Washington both leave too obvious traces of the United States' participation in the activities of the League of Nations, which the US government may not agree with. Well-informed sources also said that regarding the issue of boycotting Japanese goods, some autonomous territories in the UK, with Japan as their main customer, are opposed to this measure and have reportedly expressed this to the British government. The UK's attitude may be affected by this, so the boycott issue will not be put to discussion. The conference will probably only show that the countries concerned have reached a spiritual consensus and let the Japanese government know. (Central News Agency, 6th Havas)</p>
<h3>Enemy Attack on Eight Character Bridge Fails; Our Counterattack in Zhabei Succeeded</h3>
<p>Dozens of Enemy Soldiers Killed and Many Military Equipment Captured; Enemy Crosses the Wenzaobang River and is Surrounded by Our Forces</p>
<p>At 3:00 AM this morning, our troops on Guangdong Street, Qiujiang Road, Baoyuan Road, and Dongbaoxing Road launched a trial counterattack and were very successful, killing more than 30 enemy soldiers. In a panic, the enemy used flat-trajectory artillery to attack us, aiming to destroy our buildings. We also returned fire with flat-trajectory artillery. Threatened by our artillery fire, the enemy tanks covered their infantry and retreated one after another. After suffering heavy losses, the enemy bombarded us with artillery at 7:00 AM this morning, but we ignored it. At around 4:00 AM this morning, after the enemy attacked us with artillery, three tanks covered more than 200 of their infantrymen and attacked our Eight Character Bridge. Our army confronted the enemy on the west bank of the Yokohama River. At the same time, we also transferred elite troops to flank the enemy from Liuying Road. After an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy was defeated and retreated. In this battle, more than 50 enemy soldiers were killed, and more than 10 rifles and one light machine gun were captured. Enemy planes were once active in the morning, but stopped flying due to heavy rain. At the same time, the enemy's artillery bombarded our Gonghe Road and Baoshan Road very fiercely, but it did not affect our fortifications.</p>
<h3>Enemy Soldiers Sneaking Across Intercepted by Our Forces</h3>
<p>We Send Powerful Reinforcements to Block and Intercept in an Ongoing Fierce Battle</p>
<p>In the Liuhang area, the enemy troops who sneaked across the Wenzaobang River in Yangzhai are currently being fiercely blocked by our garrison in Yanjiawan and are in a fierce battle. The troops crossing the river at Jiangjiazhai seem to be echoing the troops crossing the river at Tang Bridge (highway bridge). They crossed the river simultaneously at 3:00 PM yesterday. Our side has sent powerful troops to reinforce the blockade. The fierce battle has continued until this morning.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the enemy near Liuhang suddenly launched a fierce attack on the position of one of our divisions. At that time, our garrison troops there immediately rose up to resist. After a fierce battle of more than an hour, due to the disparity in numbers, our defense line near Zhangjiazhai to Nijiawan was broken through by the enemy. After our reinforcements arrived and counterattacked, the enemy began to collapse and retreat, and we recovered our original position.</p>
<p>At around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, about hundreds of enemy soldiers, divided into two small boats, took advantage of the high tide to sneak ashore from Dongyangzhai and Gujiazhai areas north of the Wenzaobang River. Our garrison troops on the south bank immediately fired fiercely. The fierce battle lasted until around 9:00 AM, when a certain brigade of a certain division of ours recovered the Jiangjiazhai position. The enemy troops were forced to retreat towards Dongyangzhai, and then concentrated in that area to stubbornly resist. At the same time, they also released smoke bombs in an attempt to advance south, but they were intercepted by a certain brigade of a certain division of ours.</p>
<h3>Actual Situation of the Destruction of the Mitsui Wharf</h3>
<p>Enemy's Fuel Supply Has Become a Serious Problem</p>
<p>The Qichang Japanese-owned New Mitsui Warehouse in Pudong has a total of four floating wharves. Counting from the left, the first, second, and third wharves are for the warehouse's own use. The fourth wharf is used for transporting coal to the enemy's warships stationed in Shanghai and is commonly called the Navy Wharf. The four wharves are within the boundary of the Lu Mitsui Warehouse and are connected together. Since the enemy invaded Shanghai, they have attempted to land at each of these wharves several times. Last month, we bombed and sank the first, second, and third wharves. The fourth Navy Wharf was the only one remaining. The enemy army actually hid a large number of hardware, sundries, and sports equipment such as tennis rackets inside, as well as a batch of military supplies. On the morning of the 4th of this month, our side used a certain weapon again to sink the wharf, cutting off the enemy's only way to land. A reporter took a small wheel of a certain foreign shipping company this morning to check the extent of the damage. He saw that all four wharves and floating bridges had sunk. One floating bridge of the Navy Wharf was thrown upwards during the explosion and fell back on the shore, showing that the explosive force was extremely fierce. A Changde Wheel of a certain Chinese company was originally berthed at the wharf. It had transported more than 4,000 tons of coal before the war broke out and was waiting to unload at the warehouse. After the Shanghai war broke out, it was hijacked by the enemy army, and 2-3,000 tons of coal were successively transported away. There were still more than 1,000 tons in the ship, and now both the ship and the cargo have been towed to another place by the enemy army. There are still more than 10,000 tons of coal piled up in the Mitsui Warehouse. From now on, dozens of enemy warships will no longer be able to take coal at the warehouse, so their fuel supply has become a serious problem. They can only sigh at the coal in vain.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Sail to Yangshupu and Open Fire</h3>
<p>Firing Indiscriminately at Our Pudong Positions</p>
<p>Enemy planes were unable to move due to the rain, so the Izumo battleship led a number of gunboats to the Yangshupu River and opened fire on our positions, firing indiscriminately in the thick fog and mist. They stopped after a while.</p>
<p>Since last night, enemy warships in the Huangpu River have stopped firing on Pudong, and our artillery has also temporarily stopped bombing, so the entire line is extremely quiet. However, since late at night, the enemy warships used searchlights to illuminate the Pudong coastline every half hour, and then turned off the lights and switched to machine gun sweeps to prevent our army from attacking. Therefore, the crisp sound of machine guns could be heard from time to time until dawn. At 8:00 AM this morning, the enemy flagship Izumo was suddenly towed away from Shanghai by four small wheels. It is expected to be temporarily sailing to a certain place outside Songkou to command the warships to fight. It is said that the ship was twice hit by a certain explosive device of ours and injured. Several days ago, dozens of craftsmen were hired to repair it. After the ship left, another gunboat is now temporarily acting as the commander in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Enemy Headquarters Seems to be Moving</h3>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Songhu War, the enemy's Marine Corps Headquarters on Jiangwan Road feared that it would be attacked by our army. Therefore, on August 10, it moved all of its important military documents, military supplies, and machinery to the No. 1 Cotton Mill of the Public University on Yangshupu Road, and part of it was moved to the Japanese Primary School on North Sichuan Road and the Japanese Navy Club on Peng Road. Unexpectedly, after the start of the 813 War, the enemy's headquarters on Jiangwan Road, as well as the Public University Cotton Mill, the Japanese Primary School, and the Navy Club were bombed by our air force and artillery forces and were repeatedly severely damaged. Therefore, the houses were ruined and the losses were heavy. According to those who fled south from Hongkou this morning, the enemy army was seen inspecting the houses in the Delin Apartments at the intersection of Chongming Road and Tiantong Road last night, but their intentions are unknown.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Warehouses Looted</h3>
<p>Leaving Only a Pair of Broken Slippers; Enemy Transforms Two Warehouses into Temporary Rear Hospitals</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, the central and northern warehouses of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were transformed by the enemy army for the landing of troops and the berthing of transport ships. Today, a Westerner inspected the Hongkou district and saw that the goods in the central and northern warehouses had been looted by the enemy army. Even the writing desks and wooden furniture in the warehouses had been completely removed. The only original items left in the two warehouses that had not been taken away were a pair of broken slippers. The two warehouses have now been transformed by the Japanese army into temporary rear hospitals to accommodate wounded soldiers, and the lower-level warehouses of the northern warehouse have also been transformed into military horse stables.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Zhabei in Heavy Rain</h3>
<p>No Fierce Fighting in Jiangwan and Zhabei Yesterday and Today</p>
<p>In the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas, there was no fierce fighting yesterday evening and this morning except for occasional artillery fire. In the recent week, the enemy army has been fiercely bombing Zhabei with planes and artillery every day without making any progress. Our side, however, has suffered no other damage except for the destruction of a few civilian houses. They even resorted to various despicable means, scattering leaflets that were nonsensical from planes. At around 8:00 AM this morning, while it was raining continuously, two enemy planes came again, first circling over Zhabei, then opening fire with machine guns. Before long, they dropped more than a dozen heavy bombs in succession. At the same time, the enemy artillery on Jiangwan Road, Liusan Garden, and Eight Character Bridge also bombarded fiercely, continuing until noon.</p>
<p>Last night (6th), rifle, machine gun, hand grenade, and mortar fire could be heard intermittently north of Bazilu in the North Sichuan Road and Baoshan Road areas. This morning, the Dacha Area was bombed. From 8:00 to 9:00 AM, the area north of the McGinn Road station airfield was also bombed.</p>

<p>[Hong Kong] Zhang Huichang and Liu Weichi arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai on the 6th. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Comments</h3>
<p>— Appearance</p>
<p>In the current world, except for countries with special relations with the enemy, the political, business, religious, academic, and all ordinary people of any country, regardless of gender, age, or youth, all sympathize with our country and denounce the enemy's beastly behavior. All unanimously expressed their intention to rise up and help. How could this situation be achieved by propaganda, movements, appeals, etc.?</p>
<p>It is not easy for one person to be praised by everyone. It is also not easy for one person to be cursed by everyone. The same is true for a country. This time, the cruel and savage behavior of Japanese aggression, whether our people have personally benefited from it, are gnashing their teeth and hating to eat their flesh and sleep on their skin. Even onlookers, seeing it, are all furious and want to rise up. From this point of view, justice and humanity are still in the world and will not allow a barbaric and brutal country to trample them clean. It can be seen that although justice and humanity are temporarily trampled on by a barbaric and brutal country, justice and humanity must still be restored to the world one day. If the world were to become a primitive state of beasts eating people, then the world would not become the world.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Speech Vigorously Condemns Aggressor Nations</h3>
<p>⊙Chicago: The new bridge in this city was inaugurated today. President Roosevelt personally presided and delivered an important speech, vehemently condemning aggressor nations. He stated that the United States was reluctant to decide against participating in the war, but could not guarantee it would not be drawn into the vortex of war. The audience of 50,000 people cheered enthusiastically from time to time, expressing their approval. The speech was also broadcast nationwide via radio. He said: "If we want to live freely and peacefully in the world without worry, all peace-loving countries must work together to strengthen the laws and principles that safeguard peace. All those who disregard the law, despise humanity, and create unrest and anarchy in the international arena, should be resisted by all peace-loving nations. Moreover, after such a state has been created, it is by no means possible to avoid being affected by adopting a policy of isolation or neutrality. In 1928, when the Kellogg-Briand Pact was signed in Paris, all countries still harbored boundless hope for international peace. However, in recent years, what has been commonly seen in the international arena is only terror and illegality. This state of affairs was initiated by unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of other countries, or the violation of existing treaties and the invasion of other countries' territories. Today, the harm has become so severe that it threatens the very foundation of civilization. For example, without declaring war, without issuing warnings, and without any other reason, countless innocent civilians, women, and children have died under the bombs of airplanes. In so-called peacetime, numerous ships have been attacked by submarines for no reason and without warning. Some countries have instigated civil wars in friendly countries with whom they have no feud and participated in them. Still other countries demand freedom on the one hand, but refuse to grant it to other countries with their own possessions. Countless innocent nations and countries have been sacrificed. Although all these situations have occurred in other parts of the world, the countries of the Americas cannot remain aloof. In today's world, all countries are interconnected and have joint relationships. Therefore, it is impossible for any country to be completely isolated, whether spiritually or technically. For the present, we must restore international morality and the dignity of promises and treaties. Today's issue is not just about treaty violations; it is related to war and peace, and the principles of international law and humanity. The current international situation is like a society plagued by epidemics. To eradicate epidemics, we must isolate those who are infected. The same is true internationally. At present, peace-loving countries account for 90 percent of the world, while 10 percent threaten all international laws and humanitarian principles. Therefore, the former must have a way to control the latter. As far as the United States is concerned, I am determined to continue to pursue a policy of peace and take all possible measures to avoid being drawn into the war. However, world peace is now under threat. Once a war has broken out, whether or not it has been formally declared, it has the potential to spread, and even nations and peoples far from the war zone may be involved. Therefore, even though we are determined to stay out of it, we cannot avoid being adversely affected by the war, nor can we guarantee that we will not be drawn into the vortex of war. We should take all necessary measures to reduce the chances of causing disputes. However, in a turbulent world, we cannot obtain complete security. In short, the principles of maintaining peace must be respected, and the spirit of mutual reliance among countries must be restored so that human civilization can be sustained. However, one thing must be noted: the desire of all countries to maintain peace must be fully expressed so that all countries seeking to violate existing treaties and infringe upon the rights of other countries will be alerted. In other words, all countries must take active action to preserve peace. Since the United States abhors war and hopes for peace, it should actively participate in the search for peace."

<h3>Diary of Enemy Aircraft Bombing Guangzhou (Continued)</h3>
<p>From September 21st to 26th</p>
<p>September 23rd</p>
<p>The enemy aircraft carrier moved from Tangjiawan to the sea off Dachixi in Taishan on the evening of the 22nd and continued to send planes to attack. At 00:40 on the 23rd, Guangzhou issued its first air raid alarm. At around 1:20, three enemy planes invaded the city again. At that time, our side released a large smoke screen, and the city was filled with smoke. The enemy planes could not find their target, and our air force did not intercept them. The enemy planes did not drop bombs in or around the city, but circled in the air for more than an hour before retreating, at around 3:00. The alarm was not lifted. At around 3:40, three enemy planes invaded the city again. At that time, the haze gradually dissipated. After entering the city, the enemy planes circled in the air, searching for targets, and dropped more than ten 50-pound to 100-pound bombs in Xicun, Zengbu, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and other places. Our ground air defense forces fiercely counterattacked. At around 6:00, the enemy planes were routed, and the alarm was lifted. At 6:25, a second emergency air raid alarm was issued. At around 6:50, more than twenty enemy planes, divided into eastern, western, northern, and southern routes, simultaneously attacked the city. Our entire fleet took off to respond. The anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns of the ground air defense forces also joined the attack. From 7:15 to 7:50, the air battle between the enemy and us was the fiercest. The enemy planes simultaneously attacked Guangzhou from different directions with the original intention of making it impossible for our air force to take care of everything, so as to carry out their bombing atrocities. However, because our air force was strong and brave in responding, the enemy planes were soon forced by our air force to concentrate in the northwest and southwest corners, and then they threw dozens of bombs at factories in the Xicun industrial area, such as the Zengbu Water Plant. At this time, our anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns in these two directions fired at the enemy planes as densely as firecrackers, and the sound of enemy bombs shaking the whole city was intertwined. Our air force chased all the enemy planes to the southwest corner, that is, the Henan side, and then turned defense into offense. By 7:40, all the enemy planes were repelled. Our air force chased them far away. One of our fighter planes, driven by Huang Guangxing, bravely chased them to Humen, where it was surrounded by many enemy planes. Our plane was forced to turn back and landed on a civilian house near the Zhongkai School in Henan. The house and the plane were badly damaged. The pilot, Huang Guangxing, suffered abrasions on his forehead, back, hands, and feet and was admitted to a hospital for treatment. He was not seriously injured. After the alarm was lifted after 8:00, an investigation revealed that the enemy planes were all launched in batches from the mother ship at Daxie Island, with three planes in each batch. The first and second times they came to harass Guangzhou, there were only three enemy planes, wanting to use this to exhaust our air force's ability to respond. Until after 6:00, they launched a large-scale attack in order to achieve their purpose. However, due to the brave response of our air force, they did not achieve their goal. It is estimated that more than ten bombs were dropped in Xicun, but they did not damage the factories. More than ten bombs were also dropped at the Zengbu Water Plant, most of which fell into the ponds, with only minor damage to the water pipes, which were repaired by 9:30 and the water supply was restored as usual. However, the water color was slightly yellow. Three bombs fell on the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, two of which were near Liantang Road, far from the hall. Although one hit the center of the back seat, it only caused minor damage. Two fell on Huanghuagang, causing no damage. Civilian houses and shops were not bombed. However, the enemy planes swept with machine guns from the air very densely, and several citizens were injured or killed by stray bullets. At around 9:00, order in the city was completely restored.</p>
<p>September 24th</p>
<p>Three enemy planes attacked from the southwest at around 11:30 that evening. The air defense office immediately issued an alarm. Before long, as the enemy planes approached the suburbs, our air force was informed and dispatched a team of planes to chase them away. One enemy plane, in the high-altitude black clouds, broke into the airspace between the northeast and northwest of the city, circling back and forth, far from the urban area. Our anti-aircraft guns and machine gun teams were ready and waiting. After about twenty minutes, our planes followed and arrived. The enemy plane fled in a panic without dropping any bombs. It was found that this was a reconnaissance plane, and its purpose was to try to spy. Seeing that we were prepared, it fled in a hurry. The other two planes were also chased out of the country by us.</p>
<p>September 25th</p>
<p>At 0:05 on the 25th, six enemy planes entered the country from the Zhongshan Tangjiawan area and attacked the city. Our air force headquarters immediately dispatched planes to take off and intercept them. They encountered the enemy planes over the border of Shunde County and intercepted them. Because the enemy planes were suddenly encountered by our planes, they resisted slightly. Our planes were brave and vigorous. At times, the enemy planes were surrounded. After fighting hard for about 20 minutes, our planes gradually pressed the enemy planes tightly. Unexpectedly, the enemy planes used all kinds of tricks, and while fighting, they ran away. Three planes took the opportunity to break through the encirclement and fled into the city. At that time, the night was hazy, and it was not easy for the enemy planes to circle at an altitude of 6,000 feet to find their target. Two planes were being chased very closely by our planes, so they dropped three bombs in a hurry over the eastern suburbs and tried to escape quickly. The places where the bombs fell were all wilderness, and they did not cause any damage to us. Two planes were trapped in the airspace over the city and tried to break through the encirclement many times, but they failed. At 1:10, they ventured to break out and escape. At 1:30, the alarm was lifted. But at 2:25, the second air raid alarm was issued again. One enemy plane sneaked into the high-altitude airspace of the city and circled for as long as two hours, not daring to fly low or drop any bombs. It was expected to be reconnaissance in nature. However, at that time, the night fog was very thick, and the enemy's reconnaissance should have also lost its effectiveness. At around 4:00, they ventured to lower their altitude and circled between our Hanmin Road and Haizhu Road. Finally, they lowered it again to about 1,000 feet and swept from east to west. Our densely arranged anti-aircraft machine guns nearby urgently swept at the enemy planes. At that time, the enemy planes suddenly tilted and shook the plane twice, which was undoubtedly hit and injured. They immediately fled to the southern suburbs. At 4:50, the alarm was lifted. It was also found that in this enemy air raid, the traitors in the city had greatly reduced their activities because the constitutional police had laid a strict net. Occasionally, one or two places were still found to be setting off rockets. The military police on duty immediately opened fire. Therefore, they did not dare to be as rampant as before. At 10:55, the alarm was issued again. A team of our air force immediately drove planes to chase and fight in the airspace of Huangpu for a long time, injuring two enemy planes. Although the remaining enemy planes approached the city, they could not succeed due to the brave interception of our air force and fled in a hurry. After the alarm was lifted at 12:20, the city returned to normal again.</p>
<p>September 26th</p>
<p>At 0:20 on this day, enemy planes came to attack again, taking advantage of the dark night. When our monitoring posts discovered it, they immediately telegraphed to various places to prepare for battle. The air raid alarm was also issued at the same time. It was found that the enemy planes that came to attack that evening were five in number, flying in from the east. At that time, our air force fleet took off to intercept them. When they arrived in the airspace of Shilong, they encountered the enemy planes and fought each other. The battle was fierce. At that time, four enemy planes were surrounded by us and struggling to cope. However, another enemy plane tried to fly straight into the city. However, we had already prepared for it, so there were two other planes chasing after it. When the plane reached our airspace of Huangpu, the ground anti-aircraft guns and cannons all fired at the same time. The enemy plane still dared not cross the fire net and dropped two bombs in a hurry and fled. It was found that the two bombs dropped fell into the water and did not explode. The enemy planes in the airspace of Shilong were also entangled by us. As a result of the fierce fighting, we chased them to the vicinity of Humen, where they threw bombs at random and left. It was found that the bombs dropped were all aimless. Except for one or two falling into the fields, the rest fell into the water. All parts of our fortress suffered no losses. After this air raid ended, the alarm was lifted, and the people slept peacefully. At 2:00 in the morning, an enemy plane tried to sneak in again, but it was still discovered by us, and we fired anti-aircraft guns and cannons fiercely. However, at that time, the plane attacked from the dark side in the suburbs and once broke into the city. But our plane chased hard, not allowing it to drop bombs. The enemy plane then fled. At that time, our side was afraid that the enemy planes would come out again, so we dispatched planes to search and defend all night, until 6:10 in the morning when the alarm was lifted. At 1:00 in the afternoon, enemy planes came again. At that time, the sun was shining in the sky, and it was difficult for them to escape our eyes. Therefore, after our side discovered it, we dispatched a fleet of planes to meet them and issued the first air raid alarm. The positions of anti-aircraft guns and cannons were also on strict alert. When our fleet of planes flew to Shilong, they encountered the enemy planes coming to meet them, and the air battle began immediately. At that time, another fleet of our planes between Humen also discovered that three enemy planes had copied and arrived. They also rushed forward to intercept them and fought fiercely for about ten minutes. For the sake of serious precaution in the provincial capital, an emergency alarm was issued. After a while, our front fleet had separately repelled the enemy planes. When they chased to the airspace above Shilong, the enemy planes joined together again and tried to rush in again. However, our fleet was also circling and searching here without returning to the team. Therefore, they fought forward again for about 30 minutes, and the enemy planes fled in a panic. In this battle, they were not allowed to break into the city. It was seen that one enemy plane was hit by us and seriously injured, and it was expected that it would be difficult to return to the nest. Afterwards, according to a certain chief officer, the enemy planes that came to attack at noon were divided into two teams to attack the city. In addition to the three confirmed in Humen, there was another team of five in Shilong, but as a result, they were all repelled by us.</p>

<h3>China Flour Mill Hit by Bombs and Catches Fire</h3>
<p>Zhabei water pipes damaged; firefighters work hard to extinguish the fire</p>
<p>The night before last, Japanese aircraft dropped a large number of bombs in Zhabei. The China Flour Mill was hit by bombs and caught fire. After hearing the news, the chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade personally led firefighters to the scene to put out the fire. The U.S. Navy also sent personnel to inspect because there was a lot of gasoline stored near the factory. By the time the fire chief arrived, the flour mill was already in flames. He then found a sampan and led his men across the river to the north of Suzhou Creek, using large hoses to draw water and spray it. At that time, the firefighters from Zhabei had also arrived, but because the water pipes in Zhabei had been damaged, it was impossible to put out the fire. There were two large warehouses, a tannery, and a large amount of oil stored by a certain oil factory near the factory, which were very likely to be ignited by the flames, and the danger was great. Fortunately, thanks to the firefighters' efforts to put out the fire, a major disaster was avoided.</p>

<h3>War of Resistance Song</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuyu</p>
<p>The tiger looms menacingly before Mount Fuji, brandishing its claws and fangs, eager to devour and tear. Presuming dominance over the three islands, it rampages across the continent, indulging in gluttony. Recalling the year Jiawu, our armies hid away, the shame of Shimonoseki, when will it be wiped away? Taiwan and Korea fell in succession, respectfully the seas became a barrier to the East. The drums of war from the land of the rising sun shake the earth, ten thousand passes and mountains are abandoned. Generals hold empty sway over vast armies, allowing the Central Plains to be breached. Ma Zhanshan resisted in Nenjiang, Wang Yizhe defended Jinzhou, two heroes rose one after the other, the people heard the news with respect and joy. The Nineteenth Route Army defended Shanghai against the Japanese, the fame of Jiang and Cai was especially great. At Xifengkou, the fortifications were strong, the little clowns stumbled and were frustrated. The Tanggu Truce followed He-Umezu, the situation in Hebei and Yan has already collapsed. Enduring humiliation and swallowing insults for several autumns, dedicating efforts to national defense and construction, removing all boundaries in the divine land, listening to orders, no plundering or theft. During the Suiyuan campaign, the bandit's courage was stifled, the iron crows and frost spears became a fleeting glimpse. Oh, the leader's integrity is high, the Xi'an Incident was quickly quelled. Most importantly, the unification of political parties into one furnace, the nation's spirit is even more united. The incident at Lugou Bridge sparked trouble for no reason, the great peace of Tianjin collapsed. Bullets rained down on the Great Wall, the clouds of war spread to Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Flames of war stretched across the sky, the light of Shanghai, fleets of ships stretching thousands of miles across the sea. Now, the court and the commoners are all aroused, filled with the same hatred, courage redoubled. National crisis looms, the enemy has penetrated deep, what use are writing brushes and ink stones? Unbind your hair and secure your helmet, join in saving the nation, donning armor and grasping weapons, fight to be bathed in blood. Flying generals soar into the sky, displaying divine prowess, compared to us, the enemy seems clumsy. Not daring to linger in battle, indiscriminately bombing civilians, how despicable! Thousands of villages turn to smoke, ten thousand bones of the common people turn to ashes. Refugees fill the roads, their suffering is tragic, their cries echoing to the heavens, their voices mournful. From the southern peaks of the Five Ridges to the northern Hengshan, the disaster area is vast, truly tragic. The nations hate the wooden clogs of the Japanese, written condemnations have already been set in stone. We uphold our military might, launching punitive expeditions, a long-term War of Resistance, not to be interrupted. Soldiers all hold the determination to die, we will never kneel to you.</p>
<p>Sixth Issue of Wartime Youth</p>
<h3>The Problem of Wartime Reading Materials</h3>
<p>— Yuansheng</p>
<p>Reading a short story by Mr. Huimin in the September 30th Xinbao newspaper entitled 'Outdated Photographs,' I was reminded of the importance of wartime youth selecting reading materials, publications, and newspapers.</p>
<p>The short story said: "Several photos in the third issue of Liangyou's special issue 'Wartime Books and Publications,' 'Our Army's River Defense,' are from the 'January 28th Incident.' The photos of our army's planes in the 'Lofty Ambition' pages of the fourth issue and on the cover of the fifth issue are all from the 'Bandit Suppression' era. In particular, the numbers of the three planes (305, 311, 309) on the cover of the fifth issue are exactly the same as those in the 15th issue of 'Aviation Announcement' published by the Aviation Agency on February 18, 1934."</p>
<p>If these are indeed facts, then this publication is at least guilty of 'deceiving readers.'</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, newly published magazines and newspapers have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Among them are those that are 'genuine and praiseworthy,' but there are also those that are 'a complete mess' and 'incomprehensible.'</p>
<p>In wartime, it is indeed very important for young people to choose to read such publications and newspapers. We know that newspapers and magazines have a great mission to promote anti-enemy sentiment. If a certain publication or a certain newspaper loses its credibility, then it will at least reduce part of the strength in propaganda.</p>
<p>How should wartime youth choose to read magazines and newspapers? I dare not answer this question, and I will have to leave it to the readers to carefully review and study.</p>
<h3>To Wartime Youth</h3>
<p>— Jingming</p>
<p>Now is not the time for us to study! Do you think the Lugou Bridge Incident disturbed our summer vacation, and didn't the Hongqiao Incident destroy our schools again? Comparing the situations of the 'September 18th Incident' and the 'January 28th Incident,' isn't it a habit for the strong bandits to invade our country for the second time on their own?</p>
<p>Do we still have time to study what kind of political system? Are we still waiting to study economics? We don't need to study international law anymore. Reality is our lesson!</p>
<p>The war in Shanghai has been going on for more than fifty days. How does it affect the international situation? According to recent reports, Britain intends to impose effective sanctions on Japan, the United States protests Japan's atrocities, and our representative Gu attends the International Advisory Committee, requesting that Japan be recognized as an aggressor country when discussing the Sino-Japanese case. Other international dynamics, such as the meetings between Germany, the capital of Italy, and France, and the news of the Spanish war, reveal the self-determination strategies of the powers. We and the sacredness of national warfare. But we must recognize the environment clearly, we must be wartime youth!</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— Laoyu</p>
<p>"Offering" money and contributing efforts, this is a full display of the people's patriotic spirit.</p>
<p>"Giving" material assistance to the soldiers on the front line, this is the obligation that the people in the rear should fulfill.</p>
<p>"Dying" on the battlefield, this is the most glorious sacrifice.</p>
<p>"Times" tell us: Today, only resistance can seek the survival of the country and the revival of the nation.</p>
<p>"Youth"! In this time when the survival of the country is at stake, how should we shoulder this serious mission?</p>
<p>"Young" children, you should also try to save your candy money and buy a few more bullets to kill a few more enemies.</p>
