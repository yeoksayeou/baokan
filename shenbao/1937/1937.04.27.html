<h3>兒童健康問題</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>中國衛生教育社上海分社。日昨舉行一次兒童健康比賽會。報名預賽的有一千三百餘人。參加决賽的也有五百名之多。這可見得社會上對於這樣一個比賽會。已經有着熱烈的興趣了。健康原是人生必要的條件。為推動一切事業的基礎。兒童又是國家的新生機能。負着未來國事奠定的使命。不在今日好好地培養他。來造成一種中興的勢力。眼看積弱的覊絆。將永遠離不開我們的肩頭。提倡健康比賽的意思。固然是在奬進一般家庭對兒童健康的注意。同時也足誘致許多在適當年齡的兒童。自力調整其攝生的工作。</p>
<p>可是我們覺得。大多數做父母的。是没有不愛惜其子女身體的。事實上造成不健康的原因。還是由於一般科學知識的缺乏。營養之不得其宜。調護之未衷於理。都足使兒童形成萎弱的狀態。而此種愛之適以害之相反結果。在通常做父母的是根本不會覺察到的。必須衛生教育充分發達到每個家庭的裏面。這纔有煥然改觀的可能。在目前未曾達到這個階段之前。唯一補救的辦法。顯然是有待於醫術人員之多多努力了。比如當一個兒童感到些微疾病由他父母抱送就醫的時候。做醫生的。就該細細的施行檢查的手續。問明日常保育的情形。如果發覺有不合理的地方。便應明白指岀錯誤之所在。而予以必要適度的糾正。在内心反應之下。是容易使一般父母遵從醫生的囑咐。接納醫生的勸告的。不幸得很。現在多半醫生。都有忙得透不過氣的樣子。非但没有耐心來盡指導的責任。有的簡直連診察也不肯反復推敲一下。匆匆處方。匆匆給藥。便算盡了他們最大的責任。這實在使我們感到非常的失望。而且認為是一個相當嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>關於醫生的人事管制。我們也曾一再討論過。尤其是在公立性質的醫院裏。操大衆幸福樞紐的醫生們。是萬萬不能掉以輕心的。我們固然希望公立醫院有其完善的設備。來增高治療的效能。有其偉大的建築。來容納多數的病黎。我們更希望公立醫院有克盡厥職的醫生。來擔負他們的工作。我們固然盼切每個醫生都能秉持其高明的學識和經騐。我們更盼切每個醫生都能體念其自尊的人格與責任。因為醫生之該接近病人。是開宗明義的第一條件。如果這一層不能令人有充分的滿意。則一切都屬無謂。即使有新的器械。好的布置。也只不過是少數人的利便。而無補於大衆的幸福了。這當然不僅屬於兒童的部份。而在兒童的診察上。實更有其注意的必要。所以我們趁這機會。特為提岀。希望一般與醫事有關的諸位先生們。予以鄭重的考慮和採納。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>“理想伴侶”</h3>
<p>— 方克文</p>
<p>有一位洛勃金斯基夫人，她是一位土耳其產的巴黎女作家，她為了找尋世界上的理想伴侶”，已經週遊了世界三次了，却始終都找不到；她的名字和使命在報上和我們初見的時候，我想，她將永遠找不到吧？可是巧得很，“理想伴侶”據說終于“偶然地”被找到了，并且，榮幸之至，這一對“理想伴侶”，還是我們中國人。</p>
<p>這一對“理想伴侶”是怎樣一對伴侶呢？據洛勃金斯基夫人所宣佈的，是：“我的‘理想夫婦’是中國人，相當富有。她們已有了三個小孩子了。這位先生他自己說是已在五十歲了，使我驚異的看他外表至多是四十歲。一至於他的太太呢，”她並不如何美麗，但是她面部構造的優美輪廓，和着她的一頭髪，引起了我的注意。她的時式的黑絲旗袍，綴着乳白的鑲邊，使她的體熊顯得非常出色雅貴。誰都不相信她是已四十歲了。”這一對“理想伴侶”的職業和姓名，則據說不信任新聞記者，所以不允宣佈云。</p>
<p>她們“十分幸福的原因”，則是“我和我的妻子，每三個月我們關閉在房子裏一星期。在此時期中，我們相互不談一語，對其他的人也如此。”而其理由，則是“人腦的機構，因為日當的思慮，短時期的睡眠，實不足以回復原時的強健。同樣一部汽車，經了每小時百二十里長程駛行而後，需要休息，才能恢復原有機構，夫婦間的械機作用，較之機械更為複雜，所以需要更進步的調整。”</p>
<p>這說法實在是够新奇的，“這項自然哲學的相生法，”據說雖每對配偶可以實施了“但不能適用於窮書記，工廠工作者，以及為生活而忙碌的人；”這種限制的用意相當高妙，反過來也可以說，“為生活而忙碌的人，”“一辈子就不用想過“理想伴侶”的生活。</p>
<p>中國人在外國人的目光中是一個謎，這於洛勃金斯基夫人大概也包括在內；而近年來外國人對謎的中國似乎更急於瞭解，所以舉凡關於中國的書籍就頗好銷。中國的婚姻問題呢，因為制度的不同，也成為謎之一；而現在所發現的“理想伴侶”，恰好也正是中國人，並且其“方法”又這樣的“有趣”，正如謎語“樣；這不要說是不瞭解中國的外國人將會感到新奇有趣，就是我們中國人吧，譬如我，便也喫驚於這一對“理想伴侶”的“理想”得出奇！而洛勃金斯基夫人的手段又這樣的巧妙，她更把這一對“理想伴侶”說成為“謎的人物，姓名不肯宣佈，連照片也不肯給人看。</p>
<p>預料洛勃金斯基夫人把“周遊世界找尋理想婚姻”一書出版的時侯，是一定能洛陽紙貴，滿載而歸的。</p>
<p>我們就祝洛勃金斯基夫人的成功吧！而我們中國，勢必也將更成為“謎”了，在外國人的心目中。</p>
<h3>殺替身猪</h3>
<p>— 向陽</p>
<p>那個病了整一年的老女人，現在死板板的仰到床上，氣息低微地發看虛喘，眼珠在打縐的肉皮下輕輕的滾動，她一雙左手顫抖的擺了擺，作兒子的這年靑莊稼漢，很孝順地說：</p>
<p>“娘，你幹啥”？</p>
<p>“你，你把咱圈裏的小猪棣一個，夜裏請個殺替身的來”。</p>
<p>太陽剛落山，兒子就把一個背杏黃包袱的獨眼龍請到家來，這人腦頂心盤條蒼灰色的枯巴辮子，年歲近五十了，瘦格稜的，一雙好眼睛大得怕人，走進屋來，瞪大眼皮溜溜地向各處轉，望迎門那張判官像那兒，不時瞅瞅，像紙後面藏着什麼，他在門上檻貼了張黃紙畫紅字的幡，夜風打院中吹來，一飄一飄的發響。</p>
<p>這病人的兒子把香案擺在屋當中，點燃着半尺高的紅臘燭，香爐里捕上一把子楡木香，獨眼龍搖了搖手，讓那漢子躱出去，剩下他一個人後，便用一壘黃錢包扎了片請神牌子，在突突的火燄上燃着，直直跪到地平面，嘴不清不白的嘟噥了陣，再立起來便由腰帶處掏出隻小鳥牛角筒，嗚鳴咽咽地吹個不休，一邊吹，就义開腿跑向原野中去。</p>
<p>鄉村的居民，在無事作的靜夜里，已早早地睡了，偶而尚有一二個窗口亮着凄迷的燈光，里面搖紡車的老婦人聽見那鬼氣森森的尖沙沙的角音，便也撲的聲把燈吹熄了。獨眼龍沿了村莊跑着圈子，急促的脚步𨆉得亂草吱扎地響，狗在籬笆後一個逗引一個的吠起來。不一刻，酣睡中的孩子也被驚忭得哭了。當他氣噓噓地邁着顛三倒四的步子走回屋來，燭光已暗淡下去，香燒成灰爐了，燭苗里還直立着色的烟芯，他從戰兢競的那靑年農夫手里，抱過那匹哼得有氣沒力的猪崽，用一方新紅洋布連頭帶腦捲裏上，平放在香案前矮脚桌面正中，他雙手插腰，用那隻兇狠狠的眼蹬視着陰里的屋頂，念道：</p>
<p>“不看金面看佛面，不看佛面看眾仙，且容她多活幾十歲，換一條性命押九泉。……”</p>
<p>一陣糢糊的禱告，接着發瘋的摔着脚掌狂跳，待剛圍了猪兜轉過一個圈來就從一個紅綠布縫成的小刀庫里，叟地抽出把明亮耀眼的短七寸子，左手扭住黑毛茸茸的猪耳朶，小猪悽慘的尖叫着，四隻給繩子捆了的小腿，不住的在紅布中瞪搓。他將刀背使牙橫咬住，另隻手提起猪的尾巴，旋風般在病人床前繞來繞去，重立到矮脚桌旁時，大聲的念着咒語，把刀在桌上有節奏地敲打了一會兒，這時燭光更沉暗了，只有一星紅光還在屋中閃動。</p>
<p>獨眼龍用刀籤在案板上，琤琤地彈着，伸手拍了下猪的頂門，猛一刀，由喂管戚刺進鉤盤，一聲短促而悽厲的絕呌，血從桌上淌到地面，屋子浸在鬼氣幢幢的黑影中了。他走到香案下舉起血淋淋的刀，向上單腿跪下高嚷一聲，轉回身便把門上檻的紙幡扯下。</p>
<p>那靑年農民害怕的走出來，把香案搬了，用繩索把那匹遭難的小猪捆好，向獨眼龍道着辛苦，一面却把這小猪送過手去，這瞎子赶急打妥黃包袱，牛角筒掛在脖脛下，手提着那個死在他手中的小生命，紫黃色的瘦臉上，泛出一絲嚇人的笑紋，出了院落，一手撑起尖刀，便消沒進無涯的黑夜里了。</p>
<p>門刷的關上，這靑年農民走回屋來，胆怯的邁到床邊看看，喊聲娘，靜靜地不動也不回答，他想也許睡熟了，當他觸到老人的手和臉時，一切是冰涼的，鼻孔已消失了那僅有的一絲呼吸。</p>
<h3>食慾</h3>
<p>— 柳明</p>
<h3>寂寞</h3>
<p>“你知道今日的江山，</p>
<p>有多少悽惶的涙？</p>
<p>你想想呵！對對對！”</p>
<p>連今夜，這歌聲我已聽了三次了。多麼寂寞的歌呵！第一次是在我搬來後的第二天，窗外正下着小雨，是老天難為每一個孤單的旅人的時候；第二次是在半日前，夜已深了，都市的鬧聲早已寂滅，我靜睡在床上，望着透過窗帷瀉在地板上的月光，當時這歌聲勾去了我的睡眠和眼淚。我相信，世上沒有比這更憂鬱的歌，尤其是在靜夜，在有月的靜夜</p>
<p>一種少年人的好奇的心情，使我在隔天問問聽差：</p>
<p>“誰在昨天晚上唱歌呢？”　　“也許是那個朝鮮人，吵了你嗎？</p>
<p>我們討厭這個人，他就要搬塲了，他欠了三個月的房租，是一個終年不洗身，不說話的又乖僻又骯髒的人。”</p>
<p>我背過臉去，聽差也逕自走了。這席話更增加我的恨惘。</p>
<p>今夜，我撥開窗帷，又是一個有月的夜晚，在都市是難得看見這樣的好月亮的。於是我打開門，走上陽臺去，憑着那列久經風霜的灰欄杆，沉在記憶的沙灘裏。</p>
<p>我真不願意有人來打擾這夜的寗靜。我願意沒在記憶的海洋裏，聽往事的低訴，讓夜露嵌上我的頭髮。然而就在這時候，我聽到一聲喟嘆，低得像在夢裏聽到的一樣。我回過頭去，有一個人正同我一樣。憑着那欄杆，举起頭望着那遙照窮荒的明月。</p>
<p>我們互相默默地注視了一會。</p>
<p>“寂寞的人呵”我對自己說。</p>
<p>然而，我又總見那歌聲了，是幽訴樣低沉呵。</p>
<p>“你知道今日的江山，</p>
<p>有事少悽惶的淚？”</p>
<p>他用手撫着他的頭髮，閉上眼睛，週身戰抖着。</p>
<p>“你知道你是誰？</p>
<p>你知道年華如水！</p>
<p>你知道秋聲，添得幾分憔悴？</p>
<p>故國呵！垂！垂！垂！……”</p>
<p>“垂！垂！垂！”他拉長着他的尾聲，頭兒不住搖擺着，接着他就昏昏顚顚地返回他的房裏去。</p>
<p>我看見灰欄杆上，留下了一片水漬，在月光下亮着。是沒有祖國者的眼淚呵！隨卽他滅了他房裏的電燈，陽臺上的月光更加悽黯，　　　“你知這今日的江山……”</p>
<p>我想學着他唱，但不成聲，我的嗓子已經嘶啞了。</p>

<h3>The Scourge in Sichuan Comes in Pairs: Epidemic Accompanies Drought</h3>
<p>Eastern and Northern Sichuan Suffer the Most Severe Calamities; Daily Deaths in Each County Exceed One Hundred; Provincial Relief Association Expanded and Established; Zhu Qinglan and Liu Xiang Confer in Detail on Relief Efforts, Now Ready; Executive Yuan to Hold Meeting to Discuss Relief Measures</p>
<p>[Chongqing] Since Sichuan suffered from drought, ordinary poor people have been unable to make a living and have resorted to digging for white clay and grass roots to fill their stomachs, resulting in many deaths from conditions such as the inability to excrete and swollen feet. In addition, a spring epidemic is raging, and countless people are dying without medical treatment. This tragic situation is most severe in eastern and northern Sichuan. According to investigations, in the most severely affected counties, about two hundred people die every day, while in less severely affected counties, more than one hundred people die daily. Even in Chongqing City, about thirty people die every day. The scale of the disaster is extraordinarily severe, unprecedented in recent years. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Chongqing] Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the National Relief Commission, has been in the province for several days, discussing relief matters in detail with Liu Xiang, and arrangements have been finalized. It is reported that he will fly to Gansu Province on the 29th to inspect the disaster situation. In addition, Cao Zhongzhi, the Ministry of Finance's Special Commissioner for Sichuan Relief, will also depart from the province to investigate the disaster situation in various counties and implement relief efforts. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan attaches great importance to the Sichuan disaster relief case. It is now scheduled to convene a meeting of relevant ministries and commissions this week to discuss concrete relief measures. The Sichuan Provincial Government's request to issue 15 million yuan in disaster relief bonds is currently being addressed by the Ministry of Finance, which has ordered the Bond Department to investigate the amount of funds designated for this purpose and to study the proposed issuance method. It is expected to be submitted to the Yuan for approval in the coming days. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Relief Commission has allocated 2,000 yuan for fire relief in Chongqing and to subsidize disaster victims in Chengdu. The Sichuan Provincial Government has requested an additional allocation of 200,000 yuan for relief funds, which has been telegraphed to the central government by Zhu Qinglan. The Relief Commission is currently discussing this with the Ministry of Finance. The central government previously allocated 1 million yuan in Series Wu public compensation bonds, mortgaged for 703,000 yuan in cash. In addition, the Juye and Cheng banks have transferred the funds to the Sichuan Provincial Bank.

The two laws were revised in accordance with the key points of the revisions issued by the central government. Regarding the Organizational Law of the National Assembly, the first article of the current law, "The National Assembly formulates the constitution and exercises the powers conferred by the constitution," will be changed to "The National Assembly formulates the constitution and determines the date on which it will be implemented." Articles 3 and 4 of the current law will be merged into Article 3, which separately stipulates the ex officio representatives and attendees of the National Assembly. Articles 5 to 11 of the current law will be changed to Articles 4 to 10 in sequence, and an article will be added after Article 11 of the current law, "The National Assembly shall conclude its mission upon completion of its term," which will be Article 11. Articles 12 to 20 of the current law remain unchanged. Therefore, after the preliminary review and revision, the number of articles in the Organizational Law of the National Assembly remains 20. There are more revisions to the Electoral Law of Representatives. The current law has a total of eight chapters and sixty-two articles. The number of chapters remains the same after this preliminary review and revision, but the articles have been deleted, including Articles 11, 14, and 22 of the current law, and the article "Various special elections, such as those where elections cannot be held, shall have their representatives designated by the National Government" has been added to the chapter on supplementary provisions. Therefore, the number of articles in the Electoral Law of Representatives after the preliminary review and revision has been reduced from sixty-two to sixty articles. In addition, there are also revisions to Article 2 of the current law, the total number and distribution of representatives. After Article 6 of the current law, the words "designated by the National Government" in the articles of the chapters on regional and occupational elections have also been uniformly deleted. Other than that, everything remains the same without any changes. All of the above preliminary review results will be reviewed again by 21 members, including Chuan Zhaojicheng and Huang Youchang, at a meeting on the morning of the 28th, and then submitted to the Yuan for review on the 30th.

When reporters visited him, he talked about reporting the progress of the Yuan's work to the President and Yu Youren's reasons for declining to celebrate his birthday, as follows: The recent work of the Control Yuan includes: ① Organizing various historical governance records, reporting on personnel investigations, and carefully researching specialized matters such as flood prevention, post-war rehabilitation in military areas, taxation, and prison administration, in order to increase the effectiveness of supervision and to provide suggestions to competent authorities as a reference for promoting work; ② Compiling statistics on the effectiveness of the exercise of the Yuan's powers, the work of both the supervisory and auditing departments, and the multiple committee members and auditing departments are engaged in detailed statistical analysis, because the experience of implementing the five-power political system during the previous period of political tutelage after the constitution is formulated will be an important basis for studying the draft constitution; ③ The President is carefully considering the re-appointment or transfer of the supervisory envoys to various regions whose terms have expired, and must also ask for instructions from the central government. Regarding Yu's resignation, the Yuan has repeatedly received telegrams, stating that "to revive the nation, we must first eliminate bad habits. If this Yuan starts this trend, all agencies across the country will follow suit, how can we end the consequences? Not only will fundraising easily lead to abuses, but I also decline all words of praise. I hope that my colleagues in the Yuan will take my intention as their intention, which is to love me more than anything." During this visit to Shanghai, President Yu earnestly entrusted me with this instruction and absolutely declined the celebration. As for the old friends in Shaanxi planning to build the Youren Library, President Yu said that this is a contribution to local culture and should be another matter, and he intends to strongly support its completion, change its name, and expand its scope to commemorate all the revolutionaries and people of insight since the revolution, and that the regulations should be sustainable. President Yu has telegraphed to his colleagues in Shaanxi, saying that if the required funds are insufficient, he will find ways to supplement them. Yu also laughed and said, "I am 59 years old this year. Among the elders and peers, only I have a wife who has reached the age of being able to hold the hairpin," referring to his original wife, Gao Zhonglin. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Chairman Ju Zheng led the attendees in paying their respects and then gave a report on his recent travels to Beiping, Qingdao, Shanghai, and other places, as well as the general situation in various locations, and the spirit of the central government's proposed amendments to the Constitution and the National Assembly Organization Law. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM (Central News Agency dispatch dated the 26th).</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government held its weekly memorial service at 10:00 AM on the 26th. Deng Jiayan, Jing Hengyi, Liu Jiwen, Chen Jiliang, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from the National Government and various Yuan and Ministry departments, totaling approximately 400 people, attended. Chairman Lin Sen led the attendees in paying their respects and then gave a speech on "The Relationship between Local Autonomy and the Convocation of the National Assembly." The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM (Central News Agency dispatch dated the 26th).</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Lin Sen spoke on "The Relationship between Local Autonomy and the Convocation of the National Assembly" at the National Government's weekly memorial service on the morning of the 26th. He first gave a very detailed report on the importance of local autonomy and the progress made in implementing local autonomy in recent years. He then described the reasons why the promotion of autonomy has not been completed uniformly across all provinces and has not achieved the expected results, stating that they can be summarized into four factors: talent, funding, laws and regulations, and natural and man-made disasters. He also stated that there is now an issue that is directly related to local autonomy, which is that the National Assembly has been scheduled to convene on November 12th. The representatives to the National Assembly were originally stipulated to be directly elected by the people, but if the people do not have the capacity for self-governance, how can they exercise the right to vote? Furthermore, after the Constitution is promulgated in the future, national sovereignty will belong to the people, and the people must be trained to exercise sovereignty. With the National Assembly approaching soon, it is, of course, impossible to complete all autonomy affairs within this short period of time. However, the convocation of the National Assembly cannot be delayed any longer. The appropriate solution is to utilize existing lower-level organizations such as the Baojia system, and start by training the people to use the four rights, and then gradually promote other parts of the autonomy work. Fortunately, the central government is gradually taking measures to alleviate the previous four factors in a passive way, and in an active way, it has also determined concrete measures for the autonomy system and policy. In the future, as long as the whole country is mobilized and works together, local autonomy is sure to achieve good results (Central News Agency dispatch dated the 26th).</p>

<h3>The Problem of Children's Health</h3>
<p>—Du</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Health Education Society held a children's health competition yesterday. Over 1,300 people registered for the preliminary rounds, and over 500 people participated in the finals. This shows that society is already showing great interest in such competitions. Health is a necessary condition for life and the foundation for promoting all undertakings. Children are the nation's new and vital force, bearing the mission of laying the foundation for future national affairs. If we do not cultivate them properly today to create a force for revitalization, the shackles of weakness will forever remain on our shoulders. The purpose of promoting health competitions is not only to encourage general families to pay attention to children's health but also to induce many children of the appropriate age to adjust their health practices on their own.</p>
<p>However, we feel that most parents cherish their children's health. In fact, the cause of ill health is due to a lack of general scientific knowledge. Inadequate nutrition and improper care can cause children to become weak. Parents are generally unaware of this kind of well-intentioned harm. Only when health education is fully developed to every family can there be a completely new perspective. Before reaching this stage, the only way to remedy the situation is to rely on the great efforts of medical personnel. For example, when a child feels slightly ill and is brought to the doctor by his parents, the doctor should carefully perform the examination procedure and ask about the daily care situation. If anything unreasonable is discovered, the doctor should clearly point out the error and give the necessary and appropriate correction. Under the inner reaction, it is easy to make the general parents follow the doctor's advice and accept the doctor's advice. Unfortunately, most doctors now seem to be too busy to breathe. Not only do they not have the patience to fulfill their guiding responsibilities, but some simply refuse to repeatedly consider the diagnosis. They hurriedly prescribe a prescription and give medicine, considering that they have fulfilled their greatest responsibility. This really makes us feel very disappointed and think it is a rather serious problem.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly discussed the personnel control of doctors. Especially in public hospitals, the doctors who control the hub of public happiness must not be taken lightly. We certainly hope that public hospitals have perfect equipment to increase the effectiveness of treatment, and magnificent buildings to accommodate the majority of sick people. We also hope that public hospitals have doctors who can fulfill their duties and take on their work. We certainly look forward to every doctor holding his high knowledge and experience. We also hope that every doctor can understand his self-respect and responsibility. Because the doctor's duty to approach the patient is the first condition to be made clear. If this level cannot give people full satisfaction, then everything is useless. Even if there are new instruments and good arrangements, it is only convenient for a few people and does not help the happiness of the public. This is of course not only part of the children, but in the diagnosis of children, it is necessary to pay attention to it. So we take this opportunity to make a special presentation, hoping that the general gentlemen who are involved in medical affairs will give serious consideration and adoption.</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Kong and Entourage Arrive in Genoa, Italy</h3>
<p>Gu Weijun Welcomes Them at the Port</p>
<p>⊙Genoa, Special Envoy Kong Xiangxi and his entourage, who were dispatched to England to attend the coronation ceremony of the British King, arrived here today. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, and representatives of the city of Genoa all came to welcome them. It was originally said that Special Envoy Kong and Deputy Envoy Chen Shaokuan would first go to Berlin and Prague, but this is not the case. They are scheduled to depart for London tonight (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency dated the 26th).</p>
<p>⊙Naples, Special Envoy Kong Xiangxi, who was dispatched to England to attend the coronation ceremony of King George VI, led his entourage on the Italian postal ship Victoria, arriving here this afternoon (25th). Italian officials and many members of the Chinese Embassy in Italy came to meet them. Count Ciano, the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr. Mazzili, the mayor of the port of Naples, and Admiral Vanli, the naval commander of the port of Naples, all sent representatives to the port to welcome them. Ambassador Liu Wendao, the Chinese ambassador to Italy, was unable to come to the port to welcome them due to illness. Madam Tian Liu, the ambassador's wife, and Shen Zutong, the counselor of the embassy, boarded the ship to welcome them on behalf of the ambassador.

<h3>Both Political and Civil Parties in Japan Oppose the Government Unanimously</h3>
<p>Conflicts with the Government Are Inevitable After the General Election; The Hayashi Cabinet May Resign</p>
<p>[Tokyo] What the Japanese political circles are unanimously concerned about at present is what attitude the political and civil parties will take towards the political situation after the general election. During the election campaign, the two parties raised the banner of "anti-government and overthrowing the Hayashi Cabinet". Even after the election is over, will they continue to maintain and move towards the path of overthrowing the cabinet? These two points are the central issues that will influence the future political situation. Comprehensively considering the current situation of the political and civil parties, the two parties will likely continue their common anti-government momentum after the election, aiming for the failure of the Hayashi Cabinet, and engaging in a head-on conflict with the government. According to the views of the two parties, the result of the general election is that the seats of the political and civil parties in the House of Representatives will definitely not be reduced compared to before the dissolution, so there is no doubt that they will still have the power to influence the parliament. Therefore, taking this election as a national trial, it is the constitutional norm for the cabinet to submit its resignation. The Hayashi Cabinet, on the other hand, seems to be waiting for changes in the situation after the election, spying on the gaps between the two factions, considering its secret countermeasures, and at the same time releasing the air of re-dissolution, hoping that the actions of the two parties will be conducive to the development of the government. However, the general trend of the political and civil parties has now become unanimously anti-government, with no room for government alienation, so they will definitely not be intimidated by the re-dissolution propaganda, and will decisively fight the government to the end. The two parties have decided to adopt a unified and firm anti-government attitude. In short, under this situation, from the perspective of the political and civil parties, perhaps before the opening of the special parliament after the election, they will engage in a head-on conflict with the government to determine the outcome. The government will collapse on its own before the special parliament, and there will be a change in the political situation (Dispatch from the Allied News Agency dated the 26th).</p>
<h3>President Matsuoka of the South Manchuria Railway Calls on the Minister of the Army</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Matsuoka, President of the South Manchuria Railway, visited Sugiyama, the Minister of the Army and Director-General of the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs, at the Minister's official residence at 2:00 PM today to report on the actual situation and the South Manchuria Railway's undertakings in the "Manchukuo" industry five-year plan, and to exchange various important opinions (Dispatch from the Allied News Agency dated the 26th).</p>
<h3>The Russian Ambassador to Japan Will Soon Be Replaced</h3>
<p>Successor's Choice Subject to Japanese Consent</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to local sources, Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev made an important proposal to Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Naotake regarding Japan-Soviet relations a few days ago, and after consultation at the Japan-Soviet summit, the result has been decided to accept it, but this is far from the facts. The main task of Yurenev's two visits to Sato on the 15th and 24th of this month was to seek the consent of the Japanese government for the Soviet government's appointment of Smirnov as his successor, because Yurenev has been transferred to the post of ambassador to Germany and is scheduled to go to Moscow on May 15th to take up his new post. Smirnov is currently the Deputy Director of the Far East Bureau of the Soviet People's Committee for Foreign Affairs, and has lived in Japan for nine years. He occupies an important position in the recent Soviet negotiations with Japan. It is also heard that Yurenev seems to have conveyed his intention to improve general Japan-Soviet relations to the Moscow authorities, but it is difficult to verify the rumor that Yu would require the Japanese government to formally guarantee that there are no secret clauses in the Japan-German Anti-Comintern Pact. However, at least before returning to Japan on April 13th, Yu had already decided to transfer to the post of ambassador to Germany. In view of this fact, Yu's visit to Sato seemed not only to seek the Japanese side's consent for his successor, but also to ease the Japan-Soviet atmosphere in order to create a relatively good international environment to facilitate his future negotiations with the German government (Central News Agency dispatch dated the 26th).</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan</h3>

<h3>The Tokyo Streetcar Strike Resolved</h3>
<p>Wage Increase of 10%; Thanks to the Mediation of the Police Department</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The compromise agreement for the Tokyo streetcar strike was signed by representatives of both labor and management at 8:00 AM this morning. The Tokyo city will pay a total of 13 million yen in wages to all workers. The increase of 10% this time is 1.3 million yen, and 250,000 yen will be added as a subsidy based on the previously announced 6.2% salary increase plan. As a result of the agreement between the leaders of the Guan Zheng Alliance and the Central Committee, it was decided to issue a resumption of work order, and the original state will be restored at about 4:00 PM today (Dispatch from the Allied News Agency dated the 26th).</p>
<p>[Tokyo] As the Tokyo streetcar strike gradually deteriorated, the Metropolitan Police Department decided to abandon its wait-and-see attitude and began active mediation. Last night, Police Superintendent General Yokoyama invited Sasaki, the chairman of the workers' group, other leaders, and key officials of the Tokyo City Authority, including Mayor Ushizuka, to the Metropolitan Police Department for direct negotiations. The workers' group initially demanded a 20% wage increase, but the city authority announced an increase of 8.1%, and the two sides insisted on their own arguments without concession. At 2:50 AM this morning, the negotiations were decisively stopped. However, negotiations restarted from 6:00 AM, and as a result of the agreement, it was decided to increase wages and subsidies by 10%, which was recognized by the workers' representatives. Therefore, the streetcar strike, which had been idling for three days, was resolved (Dispatch from the Allied News Agency dated the 26th).</p>

<h3>The Paris Exposition Opens on Schedule</h3>
<p>Science and Art are Forged in One Furnace; Layout and Equipment Are a Great Spectacle</p>
<p>[Paris] The Paris International Exposition is scheduled to officially open on the 24th of next month, and will be open to the public from the 26th. The greatest feature of this exposition is that it melts art and science in one furnace, gathering the great achievements of fine arts, music and modern technology, which is extremely brilliant and splendid. Electrical engineers, hydraulic engineers, poets and composers divide the work to cooperate. What was only seen on the stage in the past is now also the case for the layout and equipment of the exposition. There are star actors, music, a grand natural background, and electric lighting scenery. What are the so-called star actors? There are 30 large and famous fountains in the venue, spraying water up to 20 meters high, reflecting with five colors of electric light, like a protagonist. Next to them are 144 smaller fountains, supplemented by springs and 250 searchlights, which are like supporting actors. What is the so-called music? The most outstanding composers in France will be called upon to create the music for the venue, and every word and sentence comes from the poet's careful structure. What is the natural background? The Seine River, which runs through Paris, will become the incomparably grand background of the venue. The sparkling water and the magnificent buildings of the venue reflect each other, which can be called a great spectacle. What is the electric lighting scenery? The electricity consumption of the exposition will reach 4,000 kilowatts, which is carefully arranged by engineering experts and Tuan experts, and the three great colors of water and light are exhausted. The Eiffel Tower, built 48 years ago, will become an unprecedentedly large electric pole, and the light on the top of the tower will reach a height of three miles, and it will be visible within a radius of hundreds of miles. Ten thousand electric rainbow lights are installed in the lower layer of the tower, and 40 long-distance searchlights are mapped to each other to form a bright pool of light. Next to it, electric light is used to form a great fountain-style scenery, and its color and pattern changes are infinite, which is really an unprecedented wonder. As for the practical aspects, the exposition will have a family electrical pavilion, which is divided into four floors. The bottom floor is an electric dining room. All cooking uses the latest electric stoves and electric cookers. Visitors can enter the room to taste the food cooked by electricity. The first and second floors are residential rooms, and all arrangements use electricity. There are simple buildings, and there are also extremely luxurious ones. The third floor is cluttered with electric washing machines, electric cooking machines, electric ironing machines, electric water tanks, etc., and everything that modern new-style families need is available. Seeing this, all housewives should know that it is a pleasure to preside over the middle of the kitchen (Dispatch from Havas, Central News Agency, dated the 25th).</p>
<h3>Performing Parachute, Birdman Dies Tragically in France</h3>
<p>More Than 200,000 Spectators Express Their Sorrow in Unison</p>
<p>[Paris] The famous American aviation parachute performer Mr. Sang, who is known as the "Birdman", performed in the suburb of Vincennes City at 6:00 PM today. He accidentally suffered a tragic death. At that time, about 200,000 people gathered to watch. Before Mr. Sang ascended to the sky, he made meticulous preparations, which took a long time to complete. He then struck a parachute on his back and abdomen, and then boarded a Farman-style aircraft, looking very peaceful. The aircraft was driven by pilot Bouriet and accompanied by pilot Humbert, so that Humbert could unfold the wings on his body when Mr. Sang jumped off the aircraft. When the aircraft flew to the sky above the command stand, the audience saw Mr. Sang jump down from a height of 3,000 meters. Then he flapped his wings and flew to the right, like an eagle. Then he turned to the center of the venue, turned to the left, and then flew to the right again. Judging from the state of his performance, it seemed to be completely successful. Unexpectedly, when Mr. Sang descended to an altitude of 400 meters above the ground, he wanted to open the parachute on his back, but the parachute only opened halfway. Then he wanted to open the parachute on his abdomen, but it suddenly failed. At this time, the audience was shocked and screamed wildly, and then saw Mr. Sang fall to the ground, his body wrapped in two parachutes. When he was carried to the ambulance, Mr. Sang only had a breath left, and he died before he could be driven to the hospital. The audience was very frustrated, so that the aviation conference did not finish and they scattered. Mr. Sang was born in Fulu City, Michigan, USA, and is now 26 years old. He has jumped down from a high altitude in his life, and slowly unfolded the parachute safely to land in the middle, a total of 350 times. He first made the "Birdman" test on February 24, 1934, and has not had an accident after more than 300 performances. Now he has suffered an accident (everyone who hears it regrets it) (Dispatch from Havas, Central News Agency, dated the 25th).</p>

<h3>Göring Arrives in Rome for Talks with Mussolini</h3>
<p>Seeking to Strengthen the Rome-Berlin Axis, Leaders to Meet This Summer</p>
<p>[London] Following his talks with Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met with General Göring in Rome this morning. Göring's visit is on behalf of Hitler, to discuss the Spanish issue with the Italian Prime Minister. Göring had been staying in Naples for several days and only departed for Rome last night. It is said that the two leaders are extremely anxious about the prolonged inability of the Spanish Nationalist forces to achieve victory. Furthermore, relatives of Italian soldiers serving in the Spanish Nationalist forces are also eager for their safe return. Moreover, Göring's visit to Italy will also likely touch upon Germany's Four-Year Plan, which is under Göring's control, with Italy actively cooperating. In addition, both Italy and Germany are facing increasing difficulties in obtaining raw materials for their arms expansion, especially feeling the lack of steel. However, the most noteworthy aspect of the meeting between Mussolini and Göring today is to increase the strength of the so-called Rome-Berlin axis and attract more allied countries. But whether this move can succeed depends on whether Mussolini can sway Schuschnigg's heart, causing him to leave the Paris-London axis and join the German-Italian axis. If so, then Czechoslovakia, because of its pro-French leanings, will inevitably be affected by isolation. It is expected that in the next few weeks, Italy will send Foreign Minister Ciano to visit Albania, Hungary, and Angola. Finally, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will travel to Germany to visit Hitler at his Berghof villa. (Central News Agency, 26th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Rome] German Air Minister General Göring arrived here from the port of Naples at 6:45 this morning. He is scheduled to visit Italian Foreign Minister Ciano at 9:00 AM and pay his respects to Prime Minister Mussolini at 5:00 PM this afternoon. Well-informed sources claim that General Göring is on a special mission to discuss arrangements for a meeting between German leader Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini with Italian authorities. This is also the purpose of the upcoming visit of German Foreign Minister Neurath to Italy in early May. As such, General Göring is not expected to sign any political agreements or diplomatic documents with Italian authorities. Among German dignitaries, Göring is the most ardent proponent of promoting friendly relations between Germany and Italy, so his visit to Italy should not be taken lightly. It is said that Göring will leave Rome tomorrow and tour Italy by car for a week before returning home. In addition, it is reported that German Defense Minister General von Blomberg will formally visit Italy and participate in the celebration of the founding of the Italian Empire (May 9th). (Central News Agency, 26th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[Rome] German leader Hitler's confidant, General Göring, left Naples last night for Rome and will begin talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today. It is expected that their discussions will have a significant impact on the situation in Spain. According to some speculation, this important conversation may produce a movement in which Germany and Italy are willing to withdraw their volunteers in Spain if other countries agree to do the same. Mediation of the Spanish Civil War will likely be one of the topics discussed by the two leaders. General Göring will also persuade Mussolini to visit Hitler at his villa, in order to show the world the friendship between Italy and Germany. It is expected that the Italian Prime Minister may adopt his suggestion. (Central News Agency, 26th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Political circles claim that Foreign Minister Neurath will travel to Rome in early May to formally visit the Italian government. The close and intimate policies of Germany and Italy, and the political axis constituted by the two countries, is an important fact in European diplomacy, which will be clearly demonstrated by Neurath's visit.

(Central News Agency, 26th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>◎Brussels Well-informed sources claim that British Foreign Secretary Eden, during talks with Belgian authorities this morning, will discuss the issue of the Rhineland Pact (i.e., the new Locarno Pact) and the economic survey to be conducted by Prime Minister Janson (i.e., the possibility of removing various barriers to international trade). As for the issues not addressed in the declaration issued by Britain and France yesterday, namely whether the existing agreements between the British, French, and Belgian general staffs should be maintained or abolished (Britain and France have already decided to maintain them), and the interpretation of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant (i.e., the provisions for sanctions) by the Belgian government, it has been decided to leave them for future discussion. Regarding the Rhineland Pact issue, Belgium hopes that Germany can follow Britain and France and assume responsibility for guaranteeing Belgium's territorial security, in order to achieve complete success. Some Belgian figures even advocate the establishment of a non-aggression pact between Britain, France, and Germany. (Central News Agency, 26th, Havas dispatch)</p>

Taking Poland as an example, all issues related to Poland have never been resolved within the scope of the League of Nations. Therefore, it is time to convene an international conference to discuss the revision of the covenant. (Central News Agency, 26th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Authorities Protest to Britain</h3>
<p>Accusing British Warships of Violating Neutrality Principles, British Merchant Ships Shelled, British Government Counter-Protests</p>
<p>◎Salamanca The Burgos Nationalist government recently protested to Britain, accusing British warships of deliberately undermining the principle of neutrality by interfering between cargo ships and the Nationalist Navy cruiser "Almirante Cervera," and requesting the British government to instruct its warships not to engage in similar actions in the future. This protest is clearly in response to the British cruiser "Hotspur" warning the "Almirante Cervera" not to interfere with British food-carrying merchant ships heading to the port of Bilbao outside Spanish territorial waters. At that time, the "Hotspur" was prepared to open fire on the "Almirante Cervera" if it interfered with the food ships. The "Almirante Cervera" dared not resist and steamed away, and the three British ships carrying food were able to safely enter the port of Bilbao. (Central News Agency, 26th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The British government today instructed its ambassador to Spain, Chilton, to lodge a protest with the Salamanca Nationalist authorities because Nationalist warships interfered with British ships. On April 23, three British ships loaded with grain broke through the Nationalist blockade line and entered the port of Bilbao. Before they reached their destination, a Nationalist Navy cruiser and another warship fired several shells at the British ships. The British cruiser "Hotspur" immediately sailed to the scene and warned the Nationalist Navy cruiser not to fire again, otherwise it would be fired upon with 15-inch guns. The Nationalist Navy cruiser and others then retreated. The protest issued by the Burgos Nationalist government to Britain, accusing Britain of undermining the principle of neutrality, has not yet reached London. (Central News Agency, 26th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>◎Saint-Jean-de-Luz British ships continue to break through the Spanish Nationalist blockade line and sail south to ports on the Basque coast. There are now four more ships. The ship "Jenny," formerly a Greek ship but now registered in London, has safely arrived in the port of Santander fully loaded with food. Furthermore, the Glasgow merchant ship "Elm Hill" has also arrived in Santander with food. In addition, the British merchant ships "Hans Poth" and "Stesso" have also safely arrived in Bilbao. They sailed from La Pallice, France, into Spanish territory and did not encounter any danger along the way. According to the captain of the "Stesso," there was no sign of Spanish rebel warships along the way. However, after the ship arrived at the shore, Bilbao was suddenly subjected to an air raid by the rebels, causing people on the docks to flee in panic. But the time was extremely short, with only two attacking aircraft, Junkers aircraft manufactured in Germany. Statistics show that a total of eight British ships and one French ship have successfully broken through the Spanish rebel blockade line. After they arrived in Bilbao, the local people were overjoyed, and the crew of each ship were treated as heroes. (Central News Agency, 26th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Montreux Conference at a Standstill</h3>
<p>French and Egyptian Opinions Differ</p>
<p>◎Montreux The French-Egyptian negotiations held here have now developed a rift. The French representative submitted a memorandum explaining what it wanted to obtain in permanent relations. After the French chief representative, Tedeschi, talked with Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas for a long time, the Egyptian government is not prepared to discuss this matter at present, and does not want to conclude this treaty immediately, because it has not yet collected all the necessary documents. Egypt is willing to resolve the issue of consular jurisdiction first, while France wants to agree on a concrete approach to other matters first, resulting in slightly different opinions between the two sides. Tedeschi has now departed for Paris with the French Ambassador to Egypt, Lagarde, to discuss the matter with the French government. Another French representative, Simon, has returned home earlier. Therefore, the Standing Committee meeting held today will inevitably be postponed. The French representative may not be able to return here until Wednesday.

<h3>Tax-Free Foreign Grain Rice Transported to Guangdong Case Concludes</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Decides on Monthly Import Volume for Each Customs Office, The People's Food Association Plans Import Measures for Foreign Rice and Grain</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication, The import of tax-free foreign rice in Guangdong Province, has been obstructed for months, and the outside world mostly criticizes the People's Food Regulation Association for delaying and not approving the visa. Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Provincial Government, considered that the people's food was of great importance, and immediately sent staff to investigate, and convened a temporary meeting in the Provincial Government, after discussion, the People's Food Regulation Association was reorganized, and Li Dachao, appointed by the Provincial Government, and Liao Peilun, representative of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, were invited to attend the meeting to preside over everything, but in order to respect the central laws and regulations, the name of the People's Food Regulation Association was still retained, and it was decided that the tax-free foreign rice registration and visa should be handled by the Customs Office together with the People's Food Regulation Association. The import of 4 million dan of tax-free rice is divided by various customs offices and cannot be imported entirely through Guangzhou. It is estimated that from April to July, each month will import 1 million dan, and the import volume of each customs office each month is: Shantou Customs 400,000 dan, Guangzhou Customs 120,000 dan, Kowloon 360,000 dan, Gongbei Customs 34,000 dan, Jiangmen 64,000 dan, Sanshui Customs 10,000 dan, Zhaoqing Customs 8,000 dan, Leizhou Customs 4,000 dan, totaling 1 million dan. If the monthly population quantity of each customs office is less than the above number, it will be supplemented by the following month. After the meeting, Li Dachao and Ding Peilun went to the People's Food Regulation Association to convene a meeting to start reorganizing the association. It was decided that in the future, the import of tax-free foreign rice would be handled in accordance with the above-mentioned methods stipulated by the provincial government, and all departments of the People's Food Regulation Association would be moved to the provincial government office, leaving only the part of purchasing and transporting domestic rice and accounting attached to the Provincial Bank. The secretariat of the People's Food Regulation Association was also reorganized. The original director of the secretariat, Xiong, resigned, and Li Dachao succeeded him as director of the secretariat of the association. After the internal reorganization, it was decided that tax-free foreign rice and rice would be registered and certified from the 24th, and import measures for purchasing and transporting foreign rice and rice were drafted as follows: ① Merchants purchasing and transporting foreign rice and rice, importing through various customs offices in this province, must first fill out an application form for purchasing and transporting tax-free foreign rice and rice to the association, detailing the quantity of foreign rice and rice purchased, the place of order, the purchase price, the type, the place of origin, the customs office of import, and the arrival date, and submit it to the People's Food Regulation Association for approval ② After approval, an import permit for tax-free foreign rice and rice will be issued separately. Merchants should transport the certificate for foreign rice and rice within one month, and must not exceed the time limit. If the time limit is exceeded, the issued permit will be invalidated. ③ Merchants purchasing and transporting tax-free foreign rice and rice must hold the import permit for tax-free foreign rice and rice, together with the import declaration, to the import customs office for tax-free import. ④ Merchants must report the daily sales volume, existing quantity, and storage location of the tax-free foreign rice and rice purchased for import to the association for verification and registration on a daily basis. ⑤ Merchants must not transfer tax-free foreign rice and rice for re-export or export. If they illegally transfer it, it will be handled in accordance with the measures promulgated by the provincial government to prohibit the export of rice from the province. ⑥ The regulation association may send personnel to inspect, seal, and store the imported tax-free foreign rice and rice at any time, so as to coordinate and regulate the people's food in various parts of the province as a whole. ⑦ In order to regulate the people's food and stabilize the market, in case of unexpected changes, the selling price of all tax-free foreign rice and rice must be in accordance with the standard price set by the association, and it is strictly forbidden to hoard and manipulate prices. ⑧ If there are any matters not covered by these measures, they may be revised by the regulation association. ⑨ These measures will be implemented from the date of approval and promulgation by the provincial government. The above measures were notified to the merchants on the 23rd for their information, and the customs office began to handle the visa and registration procedures on the 24th, and the People's Food Regulation Association sent personnel to various customs offices to assist in the handling. The case of tax-free foreign rice imports has come to an end. (April 24)</p>
<h3>A Certain Country's Navy Covets Kinmen</h3>
<p>Air Force Personnel Privately Survey Airfield, Personnel Disguised as Fishermen Survey the Bay</p>
<p>Xiamen Communication, Kinmen County is an island, acting as the port of Xiamen and Xiamen Island as the important military base in southern Fujian, and with Taiwan and Penghu holding each other, it also holds the important route to the east of Hong Kong, and is located to the north of the Philippine Islands, so Xiamen and Kinmen have long been highly regarded by the navy of a certain country. According to reports here, "Kinmen is a military important place. In this time of certain country's active southward advance, it covets the island. According to investigations, recently some air force personnel from a certain country have secretly gone to the county to survey and draw airfield maps in Wulipu and Shuanglongshan and report the detailed survey to the military headquarters across the island. Also, the island's port is deep and wide, suitable for mooring giant ships, so the navy of a certain country does not spare any effort in exploring the seabed of the island, often buying traitors with huge sums of money, and specially sending technicians disguised as fishermen to explore the bays. It is heard that the county government has obtained secret reports and ordered strict attention." (April 25)</p>

They were found not guilty on other charges. One handgun was confiscated. Hu Changping, Zhang Guoping, and Xu Yaoying were found not guilty. The written verdict was distributed by the court to the defendants and their lawyers today (the 24th). Excerpts of the facts and reasoning are provided below.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>Yu Likui (also known as Li Zi’an, also known as Li Shiru) was originally a soldier who, after losing his job, joined an assassination group organized by the fugitive Wang Yaqiao, distributed around Beijing and Shanghai, specializing in assassinating important central figures to vent his anger. On July 23, 1931, at approximately 7:00 AM, after learning that former Finance Minister Song Ziwen was traveling to Shanghai, he and his accomplices, carrying bombs and handguns, went to the Shanghai North Railway Station's east building to launch an attack. They mistakenly killed Tang Yunlu, the accompanying secretary-general. Song Ziwen avoided injury by removing his hat and hiding behind a northern pillar, and after an artist fired back, he managed to escape. Subsequently, he was escorted by railway police to the upper floors of the building, and reported the incident to the bureau chief and patrol team. Yu and his accomplices abandoned their weapons and fled.</p>
<p>By 1934, the Shanghai authorities had successively captured assassins from the group, including Long Lin, Tang Ming, Li Kai, and Peng Guanghui (also known as Zhang Yucheng). Yu Likui, along with Wang Yaqiao, fled to Hong Kong, where he continued to plan methods with Hu Dahai (also known as Hu Qichang), Zheng Yijian, and others. In July 1934, Hua Kezhi traveled from Shanghai to Hong Kong to secretly discuss establishing the Chenguang News Agency in Nanjing, appointing Hua Kezhi as president, Zhang Yuhua (also known as Zhang Siming, also known as Zhang Simin) as manager, He Poguang (also known as He Shao Ru) as editor, and Xi Fengming (also known as Sun Fenghai), Liu Shurong (also known as Liu Zhonghu) as reporters, to serve as a cover for assassinations. In September of the same year, after the Chenguang News Agency was established, Hua Kezhi returned to Hong Kong to discuss with Wang Yaqiao, Hu Dahai, Zhou Shiping, and others, planning to have Sun Fengming carry out an assassination during the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. Wang provided one six-round (i.e. revolver) handgun for Hua to take back for use. In December of the same year, when the Central Committee convened, Zhang Yuhua and He Poguang escorted Sun Fengming to the Central Party Headquarters to attempt to assassinate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but failed. Sun then went to Shanghai. At this time, Hua Kezhi went to Hong Kong again to report on the failed assassination and plan future steps. Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, and others discussed and decided to continue the operation, but the executor was undecided for a time. In January 1935, it was decided to give Sun Fengming another chance and planned to summon Sun to Hong Kong to criticize him. However, Zhang Yuhua of the Chenguang News Agency, fearing that Sun Fengming could not shoulder this important task, specially invited Guo Zhuanzhong from De'an, Jiangxi, to Beijing to serve as Sun's replacement. Later, because Hong Kong summoned Sun, Zhang led Sun and Guo to Hong Kong in March. They were instructed by Wang, Yu, and others on the fourth floor of the Qiongya Chamber of Commerce. Sun immediately expressed his determination. Two days later, Zhang, Sun, and Guo went to Wang's concubine Ai Ying's house at No. 1 Lao Mingtai for discussion. Those present included Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, Hua Kezhi, Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, and others. At that time, Hu Dahai suggested that using a bomb was better than a handgun. Hua Kezhi suggested that the Chenguang News Agency send Zhang Zhihan to preside over the effort, but this did not materialize.</p>
<p>In May of the same year, Wang, Yu, and others again discussed the matter at No. 19 Fengfu Terrace, and sent Zhou Shiping to see if Sun Fengming had the resolve. Zhou went north at the end of May and returned to Hong Kong at the end of June to report that the personnel of the Chenguang News Agency were working hard, and Sun Fengming in particular was determined, but their finances were extremely strained. He also stated that Zhang would come to Hong Kong to report on the work and financial situation. In August, Zhang Yuhua handed over the assassination handgun to Gu Zifeng (also known as Guo Zifeng) to hide in the house of Lu Qingqi, who knew about the matter. Shortly afterwards, it was taken back. At the same time, Zhang arrived in Hong Kong and spoke to Li Chenghe and Zheng Yijian, stating their dire financial situation. Wang, Yu, and others expressed their willingness to help, but no satisfactory outcome was reached. In the same month, former Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei resigned, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek flew to Nanjing from Hankou. He Poguang again escorted Sun Fengming to the meeting to attempt an assassination, but ultimately failed because Sun Fengming was too nervous when he encountered Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and could not act. Lu Qingqi telegraphed this to Shanghai, and the staff who had temporarily taken refuge in Shanghai returned to Beijing. Sun Fengming also returned to Shanghai from Beijing. The agency's funds had long been exhausted. Hua and Zhang had recruited Xiang Zhonglin in the spring to come to Beijing to carry out activities and provide subsidies to those staying in the agency, but Xiang often went to Zhenjiang. After Sun returned to Shanghai, Xiang returned to the agency. Li Huaicheng, an old acquaintance of Xiang, often came to visit and discuss matters, and was privy to the secrets.</p>
<p>In October of the same year, Hua Kezhi, believing that the Central Committee was about to convene the Sixth Plenary Session, brought Sun Fengming from Shanghai to Nanjing on the 22nd or 23rd, where he discussed with Zhang, He, and others and decided to carry out the assassination during the photo session at the opening of the Sixth Plenary Session. Because the previous two failures were due to the focus being solely on Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the target, it was decided to first target Chiang, then Wang. If neither could be attacked, then they would create a major disturbance. Fearing that Sun Fengming, who was responsible for carrying out the assassination, would be indecisive or careless, they convened a talk session on the evening of the 28th of the same month, initiated by Hua Kezhi. Hua, Zhang, He, Liu, Xiang, Li, and Sun were all present. With the exception of Liu, who did not speak, the rest encouraged and guided Sun. Sun fully agreed, vowing not to return alive. Xiang and He separately went to collect reporter entry passes, and He obtained one. On the morning of November 1st, he and Liu Shurong escorted Sun to the Central Party Headquarters, handing over the entry pass to Sun for entry. On the morning of the same day, at 10:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held the opening ceremony of the Sixth Plenary Session. All Central Committee members took photos at the entrance of the meeting hall, standing in front and back rows. After the photos were taken, the committee members in the back row first turned and entered the hall through the main entrance, while the committee members in the front row could only turn and enter last. President Wang Jingwei happened to be in the front row. Sun Fengming suddenly jumped out from beside the camera and fired three shots at President Wang Jingwei, hitting him in the left cheekbone, left arm, and back. Fortunately, there was no life-threatening injury. Sun Fengming was injured by the guards, sent to the hospital for treatment, and died. The gun was also seized on the spot. Hua, Zhang, He, Liu, Xiang, and Li all left Beijing beforehand. Hua Kezhi also went from Shanghai to Hong Kong to report on the assassination. Afterwards, Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, Lu Qingqi, and others were successively arrested in Shanghai, Danyang, Zhenjiang, and other places. Yu Likui and others in Hong Kong also felt deeply uneasy.</p>
<p>On the 22nd and 23rd of the same month, Yu Likui, Hu Dahai, Zhou Shiping, and others were arrested in Hong Kong. Numerous secret letters sent to various places were found in a suitcase carried by Hu Dahai. They were brought to the Hong Kong Central Police Office for interrogation. The communication addresses of Hu Changping (also known as Hu Changming) and Zhang Guoping (also known as Ji Fan) were found in the suitcase. They were subsequently arrested in Fuzhou, Hefei, and other places. On December 1st, Xu Yaoying (also known as Xu Yaojing, also known as Xu Yao Ying), the wife of the fugitive Xu Zhiyuan (also known as Xu Zhiyuan, also known as Xu Yuan), was arrested after being entrusted by her husband's friend Hu Zhiming to withdraw money from the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. The Central Standing Committee decided to send Zhang, He, Liu, Xiang, Li, and Lu to the Jiangsu High Court Fifth Branch Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. The court's criminal division ruled that it lacked jurisdiction and transferred the case to the trial court. The other six people were extradited by the Hong Kong government to the Capital Police Department in succession, and were arrested and escorted to this court. The public prosecutor of this court filed a public prosecution. This court deemed that the two cases were intertwined and decided to merge them for trial. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Assailant of Yan Duhe Has Been Dismissed</p>
<p>Yan Duhe, the deputy editor-in-chief of the Shanghai News, was assaulted in front of the newspaper office the day before yesterday. The situation has already been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the assailant's name is Jin Su, with the courtesy name of Gengsheng, 37 years old, residing at No. 54 Pishi Street in Suzhou city. He was formerly a businessman who passed the Higher Court Clerk Examination the year before last and is currently serving in the Second Criminal Division of the Jiangsu Higher Court as a clerk. He has always been law-abiding and is a subscriber to the Xin Kai Bao newspaper. On the morning of the 25th, he suddenly went to Shanghai and assaulted Yan. It appears to be due to a nervous breakdown. After the incident, the president of the High Court, Zhu, ordered his dismissal on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Strange Homicide Outside East Gate</p>
<p>A strange homicide occurred at the Shen family outside the East Gate the night before last, with a rather intricate plot. The thief was a friend of the victim's family. Before the incident, the assailant had come to their house and used a diversionary tactic to orchestrate this sinister drama. After the event, he was strangely calm, leaving those who heard about it speechless. The Zhu Gu family of Tai'an Street outside the East Gate runs a millet shop and has only one daughter, Jin Feng. Because the Gu family lacked a male heir, they planned to take their nephew Xu Liangbao as their son-in-law. Xu was formerly engaged in the mat business in Suzhou and now lives in the Gu family. Consequently, Xu's biological mother, Xu Liu, also moved to Changshu to live together. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday evening, a young man named Gu Jinkui suddenly came to Xu's residence. Gu and Liangbao were former partners. Gu is now working as a clerk in the Nuoying Cinema in this county. Xu, saying that he had not seen Gu in eight years, talked and chatted with him with great pleasure. That night, Xu bought wine and ordered food to entertain Gu. Gu did not refuse. After dinner, Gu insisted that Xu enter the city to watch a movie. Thereupon, Liangbao, along with Gu and Jin Feng, went together, leaving only Xu Liu to guard the house. That evening, it was raining heavily. After arriving at the cinema, Gu Jinkui, after arranging everything properly for them, pretended to go outside to relieve himself. He then quietly left the city and went straight to Xu's residence, where he stabbed Xu's mother, Liu, multiple times with a knife, including to the throat, left rib, right shoulder, and right back, totaling six wounds. She immediately collapsed in a pool of blood. Gu Jinkui then took all 74 yuan in silver from the drawer and fled. Afterwards, Gu Jinkui returned to the cinema and met with Xu and the others, but his clothes were soaked. He said that it was because he had gone out to visit a friend. When the movie ended, he shook hands with them to bid farewell. When Xu and the others returned home, they suddenly saw the old woman lying in a pool of blood. Fortunately, she could still speak and said that Gu Jinkui had done it. Therefore, they immediately sent Liu to the county hospital. Xu went out that night to find the murderer and found him at the Dadong Hotel outside the South Gate. He was sent to the police station and the next day was handed over to the county to be dealt with under the regulations for punishing bandits by military officers. According to the murderer's confession, it was revenge, not robbery. The case is now awaiting investigation and verification. According to the neighbors, the inside story of this case is quite complicated, and it may also involve romantic elements.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Director of the Land Bureau Arrives in Wuxi to Take Over</p>
<p>The Wuxi County Land Administration Bureau's overdue collection of profits and benefits and the embezzlement by the collection officer Zhang Qigu, after investigation by the Provincial Land Bureau, was dealt with by sending Zhang to Zhenjiang. The position of the bureau director was then taken over by Ding Songlin, commissioned by the province. This information has already been reported in this newspaper. Now, it is known that the new director Ding, along with the newly commissioned General Affairs Section Chief Cao Yiyuan, came to Wuxi from Zhenjiang the day before yesterday and visited the County Government to pay respects to County Magistrate Long and discuss everything. The county has received a telegram from the provincial government, ordering it to send personnel to supervise the handover. Chen Feng, the Chief of the General Affairs Section, was also appointed to handle the handover procedures of Hu Pinfang. All original employees of the bureau will not be moved for the time being. The new director Ding went to the bureau yesterday morning (the 26th) to take over and sort everything out. Hu Pinfang is currently residing in the Huizhong Hotel in Zhenjiang. His concurrent position as the section chief of the Hubei Provincial Land Administration Bureau has also been suspended due to the embezzlement case. The total amount of embezzlement is approximately over ten thousand, and the county government is collecting evidence for a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Fishing Affected by Cold Weather</p>
<p>This spring's yellow croaker fishing season at the nine fishing grounds along the coast of Nantong has seen very low yields due to the cold weather. Moreover, the recent wind and rain have caused the capsizing of fifty to sixty fishing boats off the coast of Lvsi and Jianggang, creating an unprecedented catastrophe for the fishermen.</p>
<p>Smoking Cessation Circulating in Rural Areas</p>
<p>Nantong County is banning opium addiction half a year ahead of schedule. However, recently, there are still over 1,400 registered smokers. It is difficult for the county hospital to accommodate all of them. With the approval of the Department of Civil Affairs, the county government has set up smoking cessation centers in rural areas to implement smoking cessation, starting from Yu Xi on May 1st.</p>

<h3>President Yu Discusses Declining Birthday Wishes</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that this month, the 30th, is the sixtieth birthday of Mr. Yu Youren, the highly respected elder statesman and President of the Control Yuan, and his wife. All parties are planning to hold celebrations at that time. A recent report stated that President Yu would move to another place to avoid the celebrations. The reporter made a special trip to President Yu's residence in Jing'an Villa yesterday to visit President Yu. According to him, "I am very much opposed to birthday celebrations. Moreover, at this time of serious national crisis, when we are striving for construction, our economic resources and time are all insufficient. I definitely cannot waste them on meaningless birthday celebrations. Therefore, not only will I reject all those who raise funds and purchase gifts to celebrate my birthday, but I will also not accept any congratulatory messages in writing from my subordinates. If such a trend starts, I, as the President of the Control Yuan, celebrate my birthday today, and the ministers, vice-ministers, directors, and provincial government chairmen will celebrate their birthdays tomorrow. Such cyclical celebrations will continue throughout the year, only causing hardship to ordinary salaried workers. After giving gifts to their superiors, they have little left to live on. How can they muster the spirit to serve the country wholeheartedly? The country spends tens of millions on administrative expenses annually, and a large portion of it is used for meaningless birthday celebrations. How can the country's future be imagined? As for those who offer birthday wishes in writing, they will naturally be filled with flattering words, which are sickening to read. What use do we revolutionaries have for such things? Since I heard that all parties were planning to celebrate my birthday, I immediately notified everyone that I would not accept any birthday gifts or messages. Even if many friends make the long journey to visit, I urge them not to bother to travel. I hope that all my friends and comrades will be loyal to their duties, be honest and impartial, and contribute a bit more to the country's construction. This is far better than giving me gifts and messages." Finally, the reporter asked President Yu where he would go to avoid the celebrations. Yu smiled but did not answer.</p>
<h3>Requesting a Limit of 1 Million Dan of Duty-Free Foreign Rice from Guangdong</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Cables Executive Yuan; Luo Qinghua and Others Explain the Reasons</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Nanjing Executive Yuan yesterday, "To Acting President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan: According to letters from the city's bean and rice industry, grocery, oil cake industry, and two trade associations, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are reconsidering the matter of duty-free imports of foreign rice from Guangdong. The original quota for imports has been reduced to 1 million dan. Later, Guangdong province did not agree, and the original plan of 4 million dan was maintained. Guangdong's excuse of the lean season is limited to the months of May and June. Calculating Guangdong's monthly rice consumption at 600,000 to 700,000 dan per month, the total for the two months is only a little over 1 million dan. The duty-free 1 million dan is sufficient for consumption. After June, the more than 2 million dan of rice waiting to be transported from rice-producing areas across the country, and the more than 10 million dan of rice in storage, can be transported in a continuous stream. Therefore, it is believed that after the duty-free 1 million dan has been imported, duty-free imports should not continue in order to maintain agricultural production, etc. Their proposal takes into account the rural economy, the supply and demand of domestic rice, and the food needs of the Guangdong people. It is appropriate to telegraph Your Excellency and request that you carefully review this case and strongly support it when reconsidering this matter. This would be a public service. Sincerely, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce." Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce representative Luo Qinghua and bean and rice grocery industry representatives Gu Xinyi and Chen Ziyi visited Industry Minister Wu Dingchang at the Bank Club. First, Chen Ziyi and others stated that after the six provinces and cities grocery merchants reasoned forcefully, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had reportedly presented a response to the Executive Yuan maintaining the original plan of 4 million dan. They pointed out that the lean season in Guangdong province is during May and June. 1 million dan of foreign rice has already been imported, which is enough to sustain them through May, based on a daily consumption of 20,000 dan. The grocery merchants from the six provinces and cities are responsible for regulating the rice supply for June. Therefore, they request that the duty-free import be limited to what has already been imported and ask Minister Wu to attend today's Executive Yuan meeting and explain the situation to the Executive Yuan. They left at around 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Yesterday, Chinese and American Personnel Celebrated the Success of Sino-American Air Navigation</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai Praised the Increasingly Close Sino-American Relations and Immediately Sold Commemorative Envelopes, Stationery, and Stamps</p>
<p>The inaugural flight of the Sino-American scheduled air service is scheduled to begin this morning (the 27th). It will first transport mail, carried by a Sikorsky aircraft of the China National Aviation Corporation to Hong Kong. There, it will be transferred to the China Clipper flying boat of Pan American Airways, directly to the United States. The entire journey is 10,000 miles and will take seven days to reach San Francisco. Subsequently, there will be round trips every week. Passenger service is scheduled to begin on the 4th of next month. The Sino-American Trade Association of this city and the American Chamber of Commerce specially held an air navigation celebration banquet yesterday afternoon. They invited people from all walks of life in China and the United States to gather for a meal and immediately sold commemorative envelopes, stationery, and stamps. The grand occasion is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Decoration: The venue was on the fifth floor of the American Club. The Chinese and American flags of the Republic of China were hung in the center, with portraits of Sun Yat-sen and Washington on both sides. Flying photos and red satin banners were displayed on all four walls, with the four golden characters "Flying Across the Ocean" hanging. A model of the China Clipper was placed on the stage. A temporary postal collection office was set up in the west corner of the venue. The entire arrangement was very neat and tidy.</p>
<p>Celebration Held: The Sino-American Trade Association and the American Chamber of Commerce, in celebration of the success of Sino-American air navigation, held a banquet at the American Club at 12:15 yesterday afternoon. About 300 leaders from Chinese and American officialdom and business, as well as senior staff from airlines and postal bureaus, attended. Wang Xiaolai, representative of the Sino-American Trade Association, and Mr. Brent, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, acted as hosts and delivered congratulatory speeches. Afterwards, Mr. Bond, director of the China National Aviation Corporation, reported on the preparations for Sino-American air navigation, the flight routes, equipment, and passenger and mail prices. Then, Mr. Arnold, commercial counselor of the United States, Mr. Dane, manager of the China National Aviation Corporation, and others spoke. The Postal Administration specially printed commemorative stamps, which were divided into three types: one yuan, three jiao, and one jiao five fen. They were sold on the spot, stamped for authentication, and immediately collected. During the banquet, five American women sold commemorative paper envelopes printed by the Sino-American Trade Association, selling a total of 2,000 copies, which was still not enough. Those who purchased them wrote on the spot and handed them over to the temporary postal collection office for mailing. According to a postal worker who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter, the stamps sold were worth about 4,000 yuan and were sold out between 1 and 3 o'clock.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech: During the banquet, Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech saying, "Today, I, on behalf of the Sino-American Trade Association and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, am extremely pleased to jointly hold this celebration for the inaugural Sino-American air service tomorrow. Since the National Government of our country took office, it has paid great attention to the private aviation industry. The establishment of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation in 1930 was mainly to open up international air routes. However, due to various obstacles, both domestically and abroad, in selecting the three routes for air navigation, it was not possible to implement them until last year, when the Sino-French joint transport air navigation contract was signed. The French airline added an air route directly from Marseille to Hanoi in Annam, and China added a route from Guangzhou to Hanoi in Annam to connect with it. This route was initially undertaken by the China National Aviation Corporation and later transferred to the Southwest Aviation Corporation. Since then, the air routes between Europe and Asia have been connected, making travel more convenient for passengers. This is a new era in the history of transportation. However, looking back at the air routes on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean, they have not yet been connected, which is still a shortcoming. Therefore, our people hope that the air routes between the Americas and Asia can be connected after the European air routes. This is an unusually eager hope. At that time, the China Clipper flying boat of your country's Pan Pacific Airways, after two test flights, crossed the Pacific Ocean with exceptionally good results. The British government also agreed to establish a joint air station in Hong Kong. Therefore, the matter of Sino-American air navigation was realized. It was agreed that the Shanghai-Hong Kong route would be handled by the China National Aviation Corporation, and the San Francisco-Manila-Hong Kong route would be handled by your country's Pan Pacific Airways. The process of Sino-American air navigation, due to crossing the Pacific Ocean and the establishment of air stations, was no less difficult and tortuous than that of European and Asian air navigation. The fact that it was finally successful cannot but be attributed to the efforts of the personnel of your country's Pan Pacific Airways. This is what we should be grateful for. In recent years, the Chinese people and our government have had the same enthusiastic spirit for the aviation industry. This is evidenced by the fact that the total aviation fees contributed by the people in recent years have not been less than 20 million yuan. I am fortunate to be in the position of chairman of the Aviation Association and deeply aware of the general public's fervent hopes. Therefore, today, regarding the imminent commencement of Sino-American air navigation, I dare say that the people of the whole country will be extremely pleased to hear this news. Their views are probably no more than the following two: (1) Our country's civil aviation industry has not been established for long, but it has completed its initial stage of communicating with foreign countries, which is enough to show the world that China is now a country that is striving to make progress. (2) Your country is a large republic on the Pacific Ocean known for its love of peace, and our country is also a large republic on the Pacific Ocean known for its love of peace. The connection of air routes and the shortening of transportation routes are all signs that the two great republics are becoming increasingly close. Moreover, the use of the most advanced air routes exclusively for the development of peaceful undertakings is even more sufficient to guarantee peace on the Pacific Ocean in the future. I am fortunate to be participating in this grand event today and offer a toast to wish that the people of our two countries can henceforth advance bravely towards the above-mentioned goals and make today's celebration forever retain its profound historical significance."</p>
<h3>Commemorative Air Navigation Stamps</h3>
<p>Brent's Speech: Mr. Brent, president of the American Chamber of Commerce, said in his speech, "I am very happy to be here today to participate in the celebration banquet for Sino-American air navigation on behalf of the American Chamber of Commerce. After the establishment of your country's National Government, it has made great efforts in the domestic aviation industry. In 1929, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation was established to initiate the international aviation industry. However, its planned routes have not been realized due to various difficulties. Last year, the Sino-French airmail contract was signed, and France's operation of the Marseille-French Hanoi route was able to connect with the Guangzhou-Hanoi route. This route was originally operated by the China National Aviation Corporation and later transferred to the Southwest Aviation Corporation. Sino-French air navigation has opened a new era in transportation between the two countries. However, we hope that American aviation can connect with the Asian continent. Not long ago, the China Clipper flying boat of Pan American Airways successfully flew across the Pacific Ocean twice. With the consent of the British government, a station was established in Hong Kong, and Sino-American air navigation became hopeful. Therefore, it was decided that the China National Aviation Corporation would be responsible for the Shanghai-Hong Kong section, and Pan American Airways would be responsible for the San Francisco-Manila-Hong Kong section. After many difficulties, it was successful. We cannot but express our congratulations for the efforts of the two companies. In recent years, the National Government has made great progress in the aviation industry, and its investment in this industry has reached 20 million yuan. I firmly believe that if the people of your country are so enthusiastic about the domestic aviation industry, they will also be happy with the success of Sino-American air navigation. Finally, I have two points to make: First, although China's aviation industry is still in its infancy, the opening of international air routes is sufficient to prove that China is actively striving to make progress. Second, China and the United States are countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that love peace. With the success of air navigation, the two countries will become closer. With the use of modern weapons to carry out peaceful undertakings, the peace of the Pacific Ocean will undoubtedly be further consolidated."</p>
<p>Dane's Speech: Mr. Dane, general manager of the China National Aviation Corporation, said in his speech, "I am deeply honored to be able to participate in this grand ceremony for the first Sino-American air navigation celebration banquet held by the American Chamber of Commerce and the Sino-American Trade Association. I eagerly hope that the China Clipper's model can become more and more prosperous, and we can hold another banquet to celebrate it. I am deeply gratified that I participated in the planning of the direct air route between China and Europe and the United States, as well as our country's enthusiastic participation in the international aviation industry. All of you present here are famous people of our time. I am pleased to be able to participate and witness this grand ceremony on the eve of the direct Sino-American air navigation, which has created a connection between China and the United States. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all those who have contributed to civil aviation in the past few years, as it has been sufficient to promote the cause of trans-Pacific aviation. Tomorrow, after the Sino-American air navigation, our letters can circle the world in 18 days. This great success is not only an honor for us and Pan American Airways, but also for the people of China and the United States. From today onwards, the authorities of China and the United States have cooperated with each other in the aviation industry. Starting at 6:30 tomorrow morning, the China National Aviation Corporation's Sikorsky D-43 aircraft will take off, and the air route between Shanghai and New York will be established. Subsequently, the China Clipper will make great contributions to the merchants of both countries every time it travels back and forth. I take this opportunity to congratulate the success of this great undertaking and hope that the China Clipper will not only contribute to the trade between China and the United States every time it travels back and forth, but also make the relationship between the people of the two countries closer and make the diplomatic relations between the two countries more harmonious."</p>
<p>Official Opening: The entire Sino-American air navigation route is 10,000 miles long. The stops along the route are: Shanghai, Hong Kong, Manila, Guam, Wake Island, Midway Island, Honolulu, and San Francisco in the United States. The Shanghai-Hong Kong route is operated by the China National Aviation Corporation, using Sikorsky aircraft, which take off every Tuesday and can carry 17 passengers. The Hong Kong-San Francisco route is operated by Pan American Airways, using the China Clipper flying boat, which can carry 40 passengers. It departs from Hong Kong every Thursday and arrives in San Francisco the following Tuesday. From the United States to China, it departs from San Francisco every Wednesday and arrives in Hong Kong the following Wednesday. The China Clipper, which departed from San Francisco for the first time, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday (the 26th). The mail it brought will be transported to Shanghai by the China National Aviation Corporation's Sikorsky aircraft tomorrow (the 28th). It is also heard that passenger service will officially begin on the 4th of next month. The fare from Shanghai to the United States is US$980 per passenger, and the postage for a regular letter weighing 5 grams is 1 yuan and 4 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Maritime Accident</h3>
<p>Huikang Grounded: The Huikang, a ship of the Huitong Steamship Company, with a displacement of 1,599 tons, a length of 246 feet 10 inches, a width of 34 feet 6 inches, and a depth of 22 feet, set sail from Weihaiwei this time to load salt at Haizhou Puzi Port and transport it to Hankou for unloading. On the 25th of this month, the ship fully loaded with salt set sail from Haizhou Port. Due to the receding waters of Haizhou, the ship was grounded and unable to escape. The captain of the ship has telegraphed to Shanghai for help. It has been decided to send a ship to unload the cargo to reduce the ship's draft and then tow it away.</p>
<p>Xinming Collision: The Xinming, a Beiyang liner of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, set sail for Tianjin on the 21st of this month. When the ship entered Tanggu and sailed to Chen Tangzhuang, the water was shallowest there. Only one ship can sail in the navigable channel. Therefore, a signal pole was set up there to warn incoming and outgoing ships. The Xinming was sailing in the direction of the current. When turning, the Fengli of the Zhengji Company sailed out from Shantou. When the two ships approached, they were in a narrow place and could not avoid each other, causing the Xinming to collide with the Fengli. The Fengli was damaged on the left side of the bow, and the left bow of the Xinming was also damaged. The damage to the Fengli was more serious. Yesterday morning, the shipowner of the Xinming reported the collision and the damage to both parties to the Bureau.</p>

It has also borrowed 4 million yuan from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees to purchase machinery. It is expected that it will be able to start construction in the summer of 1939. It is estimated that 40 tons of newsprint can be produced per day, which is sufficient for the domestic printing industry.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Disaster Relief Association Representatives Go to Beijing to Petition</h3>
<p>Requesting Continued Issuance of Government Bonds for Relief - Ren Wangnan Telegraphed Disaster Situation Yesterday</p>
<p>The Sichuan Disaster Relief Association of this city received a telegram yesterday from Ren Wangnan, who was sent to Sichuan to survey the disaster. The original telegram is recorded below: 1. The 14th Administrative Inspectorate District is located in northern Sichuan. Since last autumn, no rain has fallen for nine months. Most of the spring beans and wheat have not been sown. Even those that have been sown have not sprouted due to lack of rain. Even if many sprout, they will wither and die immediately. The red soil has become widespread, and there is no harvest. Currently, the price of grain has risen to more than 13 yuan per dou, and it relies on neighboring districts for assistance. Ordinary people have little to buy and still use reeds, thatch, tall roots, mulberry, paulownia, loquat peels, yellow thorn, Han wood, mulberry, willow, and other fine grasses to satisfy their hunger. After eating, many people develop yellow edema and die. Currently, due to the prolonged drought, the springs have dried up, and the rivers have been cut off. There is no water to drink for thousands of miles. The disaster in this district is extremely severe. At this moment, violent people are taking risks and forming gangs to rob food. Once captured, they say that life is worse than death and are willing to accept heavy punishment. 2. A strong wind suddenly blew in Junlian, and it was unusually hot, with the temperature reaching 106 degrees. Beans, wheat, tea, and mulberry were mostly broken and uprooted. Houses collapsed, and children and livestock were blown to death. This kind of wind disaster is truly an unprecedented catastrophe. 3. In the counties of western Sichuan, no rain has fallen from autumn to winter, causing the price of rice to skyrocket. The livelihood of ordinary people is difficult, and bandits are rampant. Incidents of robbing bags of rice on the road continue to occur. The transportation of rice between the counties of Sichuan Province is not interconnected, and the rising rice prices are hindering the future of people's food. The Association, recognizing the severity of the disaster, which cannot be alleviated without huge funds, specially appointed four representatives, Xiang Yuren, Li Qingfan, Tang Dean, and Lv Yifeng, to go to Beijing by car yesterday to join the Beijing Sichuan Disaster Relief Association to petition the central authorities for the issuance of government bonds worth 15 million yuan for relief.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou Congratulates the US National Chamber of Commerce Congress by Telegram Yesterday</h3>
<p>The 25th National Congress of the US National Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to be held today in Washington, DC. All chambers of commerce across the country and overseas Chinese businessmen, such as the Citibank Chamber of Commerce in this city, have sent representatives to participate, which is very grand. The president of the Chamber, Mr. Sproles, sent a special letter to Mr. Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce of China, in January this year, inviting him to the United States to attend the meeting so that the Sino-American Chamber of Commerce could establish close ties, and trade between the two countries could be further promoted. Mr. Lin replied that he would be happy to go if possible. Later, President Sproles sent another letter to Mr. Lin in February, saying that he was pleased to hear that he would be visiting their country and would prepare a grand welcome. Now, Mr. Lin is unable to fulfill the appointment due to busy official duties and has sent a telegram of congratulations: "On the occasion of the All-American Chamber of Commerce Congress, I am sorry that I am unable to attend and visit your country due to private matters. I hereby send a telegram of congratulations."</p>
<h3>Nie Guangyu Replaced as Employer Representative to the International Labour Organization</h3>

They had previously jointly nominated Mr. Lin Guanghou as the representative, Tian Heqing as the advisor, and Xie Jia as the advisor and secretary, which had been reported. It has now been found that Lin Kanghou is unable to accept the nomination due to his heavy duties. They have now jointly nominated Nie Guangyu as the employer representative for this session. The remaining advisors and secretaries remain the same as the original nominations and have not changed. They are submitting Mr. Nie's resume to the Ministry for inspection and approval and respectfully request that it be forwarded to the Executive Yuan for appointment, which would be convenient for the public. The Association also telegraphed the Ministry of Industries today, which happens to be the day of the Executive Yuan's routine meeting, to report the matter so that it could be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Banking Community Invests in Hengzhong Textile Factory</h3>
<p>Capital of 3.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Hunan Provincial Government, in order to develop the province's textile industry, had agreed with local gentry and businessmen and the Shanghai banking community to establish the Weizhong Textile Factory. Its capital is 3.5 million yuan, with 20% of the shares (700,000 yuan) being government shares, which will be allocated by the Hunan Provincial Government itself. The remaining 80% of the shares are business shares, with 10% (350,000 yuan) being subscribed by local businessmen and the other 70% (2.35 million yuan) being invested by various banks in Shanghai, which have also been confirmed. It has been decided to hold a meeting in the coming days. It is heard that the board of directors will be organized with nine directors. It has also been agreed that two government shares will be filled by the directors of the province's construction and finance departments, and the rest will be elected by business shares. There will be three supervisors, one from the government and two from business. As for the location of the factory, it is roughly in western Hunan, and the location is still under consideration. The machinery and equipment will be the latest models, with 30,000 spindles and 500 looms. It is heard that the board of directors has decided to order them from abroad and purchase land to build factory buildings. At the earliest, it will be able to start construction in the second half of next year. The raw cotton can be obtained from the nearby cotton-producing areas. As for the output, it is estimated that about 90 pieces of 16-count coarse yarn will be produced per day, with half of it being used for self-consumption and the other half being woven into cloth, with 1,200 bolts being produced per day, which will be sold entirely in various parts of the province and will be entrusted to the China Cotton Corporation to handle all its business.</p>
<h3>Prince Sha and Others Acted Yesterday</h3>
<p>Changed to Go to Beijing Tonight</p>
<p>Prince Sha, Chairman of the Suimeng Council, and Prince Kang, Committee Member of the Council and Director of the Industry Bureau, and Committee Member Prince E, were originally scheduled to go to Beijing by car yesterday morning. However, upon learning that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek would meet with them today, they temporarily suspended their plans and rescheduled to take the 11:00 pm express train to Beijing tonight. They went out at around 10:00 yesterday morning and visited Mr. Qian Dajun, Director of the Chairman's Adjutant Office of the Military Affairs Commission, and Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, and others before returning to their residence to rest at around 3:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Records of Current People</h3>
<p>Ye Chucang, Liu Ruiheng, Wu Dingchang, Fu Rulin, Zhang Gongquan, and Zou Lin took the overnight express train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<p>Former French Governor of Vietnam Vanier arrived in Shanghai on the 5:20 pm express train from Beijing yesterday and arrived at the station at 10:20 pm.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Intensifies Investigation and Arrest of Private Smokers</h3>
<p>Completing the Supplementary Registration Work on Time</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau, with the deadline for supplementary registration and the fourth period of license renewal approaching quickly, has seen a surge in the number of registrations and renewals in recent days. However, given the large number of private smokers arrested, it is clear that a majority of smokers have failed to register. In addition to continuing to organize propaganda teams to go out and publicize and encourage registration and renewal, it has also ordered all police officers to intensify investigations and arrests. Anyone who looks suspicious and has a smoky face will be strictly questioned and searched. In the past two days, the various branches have detained more than 300 private smokers. Unlicensed smokers in this city will find it difficult to escape the eyes and ears of the investigators under this strict investigation. Therefore, it is better to take the initiative to apply for supplementary registration. It has also been found that there are only a few days left for the license renewal period. The Police Bureau is urging smokers to renew their licenses quickly. In the future, once the renewal period expires, it will no longer be possible to renew them, and they will all be treated as unlicensed private smokers. Smokers with third-period licenses should not delay and make mistakes.</p>

<h3>Thousands of Slum Dwellers in the Eastern District of Shanghai Petitioned the Municipal Council Yesterday</h3>
<p>Detectives Stopped Them, and After a One-Hour Standoff, They Gradually Dispersed - Mr. He Replied to the Representatives that 500 Rooms Would be Demolished First</p>
<p>The slum dwellers in the area of Pingliang Road, Linqing Road, Huade Road, Huasheng Road, Huishan Road, Yangzhou Road, Yangshuqing Road, Zhabei Road, and Meizhou Road in the Eastern District have been ordered by the Municipal Council to demolish their homes before May 1st. They have repeatedly appealed to all parties for relief. Recently, the Municipal Council saw that the slum dwellers showed no signs of demolition and ordered the Public Works Department to prepare to hire workers to carry out forced demolition, which caused panic among the people. Therefore, yesterday morning, they held a joint petition to the Municipal Council. Ten slum dwellers from each road formed a group, led and presided over by a group leader. At 9:00 yesterday morning, they gathered at Zhaoyang Road, Meizhou Road, and Yangshupu Road one after another, with no less than 5,000 men and women, blocking the roads. They held banners with the words "Slum Dwellers' Petition, Please Withdraw the Demolition Order." Upon hearing the news, the Yangshupu Police Station immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign armed detectives to stop them. Later, Chief Detective Gao from the Central Police Station also rushed to persuade them. After a one-hour standoff, fortunately, no accidents occurred. Finally, Tang Anping, Shen Changgui, Ding Mingshan, and 12 others were elected as representatives to petition the Municipal Council. The crowd gradually dispersed. After the representatives went to the Municipal Council, they were received by Mr. He Dehui. Mr. He especially conveyed this to the Bureau and instructed them to go back to wait for news at around 4:00 in the afternoon. Later, the representatives returned on time. Mr. He replied to the representatives that one-tenth of the slums must be demolished every year, which was decided by the previous Board of Directors meeting and cannot be changed. 500 rooms should be demolished first in May. As for affordable housing, it is difficult to realize due to funding and the large number of empty houses.</p>
<h3>Niu Changyao of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee Went to Japan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Niu Changyao of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, although he has been working in the Party Department for many years, always feels that his academic discussion is insufficient and is especially afraid that he will not be able to cope with the difficulties of the future. He applied to the Provincial Government last year for an allocation of 5,000 yuan to subsidize his study abroad expenses and allocated 15,000 yuan from his personal savings from past years as a long-term study abroad preparation. He initially went to Japan and then studied in Italy. Unexpectedly, Mr. Niu's wife suddenly became seriously ill, and he was also busy with the National Election and had no time for this. His wife passed away this spring, and the National Election has also been arranged properly. Mr. Niu came to Shanghai a few days ago and took the Japanese Empress liner to Japan yesterday, and resigned from his position on the Party Committee to avoid falsely holding a title and receiving an idle salary. The Central Government also appreciated his sincerity and has approved his resignation.</p>

<h3>Former Director of the Zhejiang Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau, Fan Guang, is Accused of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Jiang Zhongzhu Paid a Deposit of 7,500 Yuan to Seek the Position of Branch Director; He Never Received a Receipt for the Deposit; The Trial Opened Yesterday and Fan Guang was Ordered to Post Bail</p>
<p>Jiang Zhongzhu, formerly the Director of the Kangshu Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Branch and a native of Changzhou, is 36 years old. He retained lawyer Lu Dingkui to file a complaint in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Fan Guang (formerly the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs), currently a Counselor of the Ministry of Finance and formerly the Director of the Zhejiang Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau, residing at No. 529, Lane 527, West Hams Road, and Zhu Zhengqian, the Chief Accountant of the Zhejiang Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau, of embezzling his deposit and requesting an investigation. It is alleged that in July of last year, the plaintiff paid a deposit of 7,500 yuan in the residence of the first defendant to seek the position of Branch Director, which was received by the second defendant. A letter of appointment was issued at the time, and it was said that the receipt for the deposit would be delivered after he took office. However, from the time he took office until he left office, he never received the receipt for the deposit, and he repeatedly urged them by letter and telegram, but they ignored him. He requested that they be investigated according to law. The court accepted the complaint and, after repeated hearings by Judge Zhang Minsheng, the defendants failed to appear on the pretext. When the plaintiff, Jiang Zhongzhu, appeared in court to answer questions, the Hangzhou District Procuratorate sent a document to the Second Special Court requesting that he be transferred for investigation, causing the case to be delayed. Yesterday morning, another hearing was held. The plaintiff was represented by his lawyer, who stated the criminal facts of the two defendants and presented documentary evidence of letters and telegrams, listed the addresses of witnesses, and requested that they be summoned. The defendant Fan Guang appeared in court with his defense lawyer Wu Kaisheng, and Zhu Zhengqian appeared in court with his defense lawyer Cai Xiaobai. In court, the judge asked Fan Guang: Why didn't you give the plaintiff a receipt for the deposit? He replied: I didn't receive the deposit. The judge asked: If you didn't receive the deposit, how did you trust him to be the Branch Director? He replied: After Jiang took office, he asked his brother Jiang Zuoping to guarantee him. His brother is the Secretary of the Guohua Bank. The judge asked: If his brother guaranteed him, why is there no guarantee letter? Fan was speechless and then replied that he had sent a letter urging him to submit it, but he had not submitted it. At this point, lawyer Wu Kaisheng said that the plaintiff's witnesses and material evidence were incomplete and that he had repeatedly failed to appear when summoned. He asked the court to review the situation. The judge said that the plaintiff had already submitted all the evidence and that the defendants had repeatedly failed to appear when summoned. Lawyer Wu said again that the defendant was still ill today and was a Counselor of the Ministry of Finance, a person of status, and should be forgiven by the court. At this point, the court ordered that the hearing be adjourned to the 30th and ordered Fan to post bail and be temporarily taken away by his defense lawyer, limited to submitting a formal bail within three days. The lawyer representing the plaintiff was also instructed to inform the plaintiff that he must appear in court himself for the next hearing.</p>

<h3>Family Discord Leads to Shanghai Seeking a Livelihood, Encountering Fraud</h3>
<p>Watching a Play, the Father Was Lured and Defiled by a Villain; Possessions Stolen, Resentment and Attempted Suicide</p>
<p>At 0:50 AM yesterday morning, a young woman, Chen Yuan (25 years old) from Tongzhou, was lamenting her fate in a small alley on Minguo Road. She was discovered by Hu Peigen of the Fourth Precinct tying her belt to the iron window grilles to hang herself. Because the young woman did not look like a poor woman, he questioned her. According to her, she had come to Shanghai from Tongzhou recently due to a family quarrel, wanting to work in a factory to support herself. However, she had no introductions. Today, while watching a play, she was lured to a hotel and defiled by someone named Xu, and then all her possessions were stolen. Because she had nowhere to go, she attempted suicide. The officer immediately took her to the Old North Gate Police Station. After questioning by Officer Hu about whether she had relatives in Shanghai, she said that she had a relative in Xiaodongmen, but she did not know the house number. As the woman had been deceived and had no home to return to, it was decided to report the situation to the bureau for relief.</p>
<h3>Female Runner of Weaving Factory Accused of Embezzlement by the Factory</h3>
<p>Defendant Released on Bail after Yesterday's Trial Adjourned</p>
<p>The Datong Weaving Factory at No. 58 Pushi Road accused female runner Xu Yueming (34 years old, Shanghai native) of embezzlement in the Criminal Division of the Local Court. The trial was heard by Judge Yu yesterday afternoon. Chen Chengrong appeared in court on behalf of the Datong Factory, stating that Xu Yueming was a salesperson and had a contract. She was not responsible for the factory's work, and all accounts receivable outside the factory had receipts and were collected by another bill collector. The runner could not collect them on her behalf. Recently, it was discovered that she had privately embezzled 150 yuan from the Sichuan Chongqing Nayuna account, 30 yuan from the Wuxi Xinsheng Bookstore, and 49 yuan from the Suzhou Guangdong Jiuhua Socks Factory, all in the name of the factory owner's wife. There are receipts and letters as evidence. There are also over 20 yuan from Laoyuanji, 60 yuan from Xinhongchang, 49 yuan, 5 jiao from Zhang Zhouyu, 36 yuan, 2 jiao, and 8 fen from Zhengyu, and 60 yuan from Zhang Yuchun, etc. Xu Yueming stated that she signed a contract with the factory in July of the 24th year of the Republic to be a runner, with commissions as remuneration. She was not responsible for daily accounts because they could not be collected, so they asked her to collect them on their behalf. Because the factory saved on stamp duty, there were sometimes no receipts. The 150 yuan was paid to her as a commission. She had sold over 20,000 yuan worth of goods and should have received over 1,000 yuan in commissions, but only over 100 yuan was paid. She was falsely accused to avoid paying the commissions. The court adjourned the trial to a later date and released the defendant on bail for 300 yuan.</p>

<h3>Golden Su Attacks Yan Duhe with Extreme Violence, an Inconceivable Malady</h3>
<p>Allegedly Discovered in a Dream, etc. Should a Psychiatric Evaluation Be Conducted?</p>
<p>Yan Duhe, the deputy chief editor of the Xinwenbao newspaper, was suddenly attacked by Jin Su, a native of Suzhou, with a rasp, who stabbed him violently in the neck, causing injury. The incident occurred around one o'clock in the afternoon while Yan was on his way to work at the newspaper office. Jin was apprehended by Meng Zongpei, the elevator operator of the newspaper, and Xiang Bofeng, Constable No. 396, and handed over to the General Police Station. Hua Detective Liu Xiangqi and Detective Liang Gansheng investigated the matter, and Jin was taken into custody. This was reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Jin to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court, with Judge Xiao Xieffen presiding.</p>
<p>Judge Interrogates</p>
<p>Yan Duhe was unable to attend due to his injuries, so lawyer Wu Zhiping represented him in court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated first that the victim, Yan Duhe, was at the Xinwenbao newspaper office on Hankou Road yesterday afternoon, preparing to step into the elevator, when the defendant suddenly approached, grabbed Yan's collar with his left hand, and stabbed Yan violently in the neck with a rasp in his right hand. Because Yan resisted, half of the rasp broke off inside Yan's neck. Jin was apprehended on the spot, and Yan went to Renji Hospital, where a doctor removed the rasp and bandaged the wound. Yan then went to the police station. The reason the defendant wanted to stab Yan was because he suffered from a mental illness, believing that Yan Duhe was</p>
<p>Casting Spells</p>
<p>on him. Therefore, he repeatedly sent letters to Yan, or visited Yan in Shanghai on Sundays, harassing him endlessly. Yan replied in detail, explaining the situation, or asked friends to explain, but the defendant remained unconvinced. Last week, he came to Shanghai again to visit Yan, but Yan refused to see him. Unexpectedly, this incident occurred yesterday. When the defendant was arrested, a reply letter from Yan Duhe explaining the situation to the defendant was found on his person. The defendant confessed to the stabbing in the police station and provided a written statement. However, whether the defendant suffers from a mental illness requires evaluation, and whether he had the intention</p>
<p>to Kill Yan</p>
<p>must also be investigated. Therefore, he requested that the case be adjourned for further hearing. The police are currently prosecuting the defendant under Article 276 of the Criminal Law for causing serious injury to another person, etc. Subsequently, lawyer Wu Zhiping, representing Yan Duhe, described the circumstances, stating that the defendant had been harassing the injured party for more than a year. Although Yan Duhe replied with letters or explained in person, it was ineffective. Yan asked his friend, Cheng Xiaoqing, to visit the defendant's residence at No. 54 Pishi Street, Suzhou, to explain, but when the defendant discussed other matters, his speech was coherent and orderly. However, when Yan Duhe was mentioned, he</p>
<p>Became Radically Different</p>
<p>He insisted that his mental distress was caused by Yan's use of supernatural powers that humans could not resist. The defendant's mother also stated that the defendant suffered from a nervous disorder. Unexpectedly, yesterday's incident occurred. Now, the injured party requests that the court handle the matter in accordance with security measures, etc., and presented multiple letters from the defendant to Yan to the court for questioning.</p>
<p>Jin Su testified</p>
<p>that he was 40 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 54 Pishi Street, Suzhou. He works at the Suzhou High Court, initially managing the issuance of summonses and currently distributing new cases, a position he has held for more than four years. Ten years ago, he suddenly suffered from an incomprehensible illness, sometimes unable to hold a pen, and sometimes his mind suddenly became unclear. The matters he handled were also erroneous because of this. Initially, he did not know the cause, but later he discovered in a dream that Yan Duhe was using supernatural powers that humans could not resist to make him like this. Furthermore, he discovered the tone of Yan's ill will in the words of Yan's Kuaihuo Lin talks in the Xinwenbao newspaper. Therefore, he negotiated with Yan, but after explanation, he still believed that he was being harmed by Yan. He thought that there was no legal recourse for Yan's actions, so he also intended to inflict some physical pain on Yan to vent the anger in his chest. The judge immediately told him that Yan had</p>
<p>Never Met Him Before</p>
<p>so why would he harm him? But Jin still insisted on his preconceived notions, believing that Yan was using spells to trick him. Lawyer Wu Zhiping then stated that Yan Duhe, fearing that the defendant might be stimulated after reading his articles, asked Cheng Xiaoqing to persuade him not to read his talks anymore. According to the defendant, he had already stopped reading the Xinwenbao for a year. Judge Xiao checked the report and then announced that the case would be adjourned for one week for further hearing.

<p>New Culture writers Ba Jin, Zhou Zuoren, Ye Shaojun, Xie Shuixin, and the managers of Kaiming Bookstore, Zhang Xichen, and Beixin Bookstore, Li Zhiyun, etc., jointly retained lawyers Wu Zhiping and Fang Jiazhen to file a lawsuit in the Second Criminal Court against Zhang Lanxiao, the manager of Fanggu Bookstore at No. 1 Dongmulaihuo Street, Xigaodi Lane, for copyright infringement. They claimed that Zhang Lanxiao had reprinted dozens of registered books written and published by the plaintiffs, including Ba Jin's short story collections, Hai Xing Zaji, Miewang, Tanlongji, Chengzhong, Wangshi, Ding Ling Wenxuan, etc., and was selling them in the market. They requested that he be investigated in accordance with Article 33 of the Copyright Law and that the issuance of the books be prohibited in advance in accordance with Article 31 of the same law, etc. This was briefly reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhu Chuzhe presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. Both parties were represented by their respective attorneys. First, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs stated the grounds for the lawsuit. The defendant's lawyer, Pan Zhenya, argued that the books published by the defendant were selections of essays, which differed from reprinting in principle, and presented written arguments. He also stated that there was still a question in this case. Ba Jin and the defendant were friends, and Ba Jin had indicated to the defendant in Shanghai that he had not filed a lawsuit. As for Zhou Zuoren in Beiping and Xie Shuixin in the United States, he requested that the court summon the plaintiffs to the court for questioning. The court reviewed the statements and decided to adjourn the hearing for investigation.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Bicycles on Highways</h3>
<p>Reply from the National Highway Commission</p>
<p>Xing Zhigang, the head of the Fifth District of Shanghai County, found that the Fourth and Fifth Districts of Pudong, located between Nanhui County and Shanghai Municipality, had each established their own bicycle taxes, resulting in triple taxation by the county and city governments, preventing mutual access. Therefore, he repeatedly petitioned the National Highway Commission to propose relief. Yesterday, he received a reply from the General Office of the Commission stating that the case had been discussed and resolved by Zhao Zukang, a standing member of the Commission. Enclosed is a copy of the eighth case of the current Standing Committee, "Provisional Measures for Bicycles to Travel on Highways and Uniform Bicycle Taxes in Various Provinces and Cities," for your reference. ① In order to facilitate the passage of bicycles on highways and to standardize bicycle taxes, the National Economic Commission and the provinces and cities participating in intercommunication automobiles have formulated these provisional measures. ② Privately owned and commercial bicycles in each province and city should be registered and taxed annually in the locality of the bicycle owner. The annual tax should be one yuan per bicycle, including the license and other fees. However, if the original tax rate of each province and city is higher than one yuan, those who are afraid of reducing it may temporarily collect according to the original tax rate of the province and city, and gradually reduce it to one yuan before the end of the eighteenth year. ③ Bicycles from each province and city that have been registered and taxed by the competent authority in the locality of the bicycle owner shall be allowed to pass through other provinces and cities without additional tolls and intercommunication taxes. However, the stay in any other province or city shall not exceed one year. ④ If the stay of a bicycle in any other province or city exceeds the prescribed time limit, it shall be immediately registered and taxed in the province or city where it is staying, and the original license shall be surrendered at the same time. ⑤ Bicycles passing through other provinces and cities shall comply with all traffic regulations of the passing provinces and cities. If there is any violation, it shall be punished according to the regulations of the violating province or city. If the violator has left the province or city where the violation occurred, the competent authority of the province or city where he is located may be notified to enforce the punishment. ⑥ Freight bicycles in each province and city may be temporarily handled in accordance with ordinary bicycles when traveling on highways, but provinces and cities with narrow road widths and excessive bends may prohibit passage. ⑦ These measures shall be decided by the Standing Committee of the National Highway Commission, and after being sent to the National Economic Commission and forwarded to the provincial and municipal governments for approval, they shall be promulgated and implemented.</p>

<h3>Increased Price of Beef and Mutton</h3>
<p>The Beef and Mutton Traders Association has issued a notice stating: "The source of cattle slaughtered in this city comes from Shandong, Anhui, Hebei, Henan, and the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang near this city. Recently, most of the cattle produced in these areas have been purchased at high prices and transported to Qingdao for slaughter, and the meat is exported abroad. The Zhejiang provincial authorities have also banned cattle from leaving the country, resulting in a scarce source of cattle in this city and soaring prices. The price of sheep has also increased sharply because the herdsmen in the producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have realized huge profits by slaughtering ewes and fetal sheep to obtain and sell their skins, cutting off the source of supply. Compared with the previous month, the price of cattle has increased by more than 100%, and the price of sheep has increased by as much as 200%. In view of this situation, the losses of our colleagues who sell these meats have reached their limit. If we continue to sell at the predetermined prices, our limited capital will inevitably lead to the inability to maintain our business. Therefore, our association convened a meeting on April 22 to discuss raising prices. It was decided that, 'From May 1 of this year, all beef sold will be increased by 10% of the original price (such as 26 cents per pound for 20 cents, 39 cents per pound for 30 cents, and so on), and mutton will be increased by 50%. Customers who have long-term transactions and have contracts with fixed prices should also increase the original contract prices in full to maintain their capital.' In addition to publishing this notice in the newspaper, we hereby record this notice to all colleagues, urging them to strictly comply and to inform customers to comply as well. This is important. Shanghai Beef and Mutton Traders Association, April 23, 26th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>Wusong Spring Fish on the Market</h3>
<p>Wusong is a major production and sales center for spring fish (i.e., yellow croaker), and its annual business is quite large. This year's general distributors are Kaitai, Shen Tai, and Tongyu (reorganized from Cuisheng) three fish shops. Yesterday morning, the first batch of spring fish, carried by the boat "Gongheshun", arrived fully loaded. After the customs inspector and the tax police captain Yin Risheng inspected the boat, the fish were unloaded and sold. The opening price was set at 6.60 yuan per "chou" of the city scale (110 jin), and one yuan could buy about 15 jin of fish. There was not much goods yesterday, only enough to meet the needs of local fishmongers. Wholesale from inland merchants will have to wait for the arrival of larger fishing fleets. Yesterday afternoon, Zhang Panshi, the director of the Joint Chamber of Commerce of Fishermen's Representatives, hosted a banquet to entertain Liu Jianqun, the second district chief of the tax police, Tang Chengzong, the managing director of the fish market, and officials from various land and water authorities. During the banquet, they discussed various measures for protecting fish resources and production and sales.</p>
<h3>Record of the Sixth Regular Meeting of the Mining and Metallurgical Engineering Society's Shanghai Branch</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Mining and Metallurgical Engineering Society held its sixth regular meeting at 6:30 PM on the 24th of this month in the drawing room of the Ahshi Building on Xianzhou Road, presided over by President Lu Zhixue. He delivered a speech on the manufacture and uses of sulfuric acid. The summary is as follows: Sulfuric acid is a basic raw material in modern industry, and the amount of sulfuric acid used in a country is an indicator of the strength of its industry. The United States uses about 8 million tons annually, accounting for more than 50% of the world's production. Japan's recent increase in production is the most alarming. In 1913, it only produced 70,000 tons of 100% acid, 110,000 tons in 1925, and more than 1 million tons in 1936. Our country produces less than 10,000 tons. The raw materials used to manufacture sulfuric acid are either sulfur or iron sulfide. The former is purchased from the United States and Japan, and the latter is purchased from Spain and Korea, or mined in various provinces. If our country wants to be self-sufficient, we should search for adequate iron sulfide mines and establish factories for manufacturing in different regions. Wang Ziwu then spoke, saying that for decades, the amount of sulfur emitted from lead and antimony smelting furnaces into the air has been enormous. If our country's engineers could accumulate it, they could turn harm into benefit. He also said that although the Water Conservancy Company has built a factory in Pukou to manufacture sulfuric acid fertilizer, it is far from meeting the needs of the whole country. If the use of fertilizers in the country becomes more widespread, the source of sulfur will become even more important. After the meeting, the attendees sat down for dinner, which ended at 5:30. Those present that day were Yu Ziwei, Sun Xianhui, Lu Zhixue, Zheng Weisan, Pan Songyao, Shen Maiqun, Wang Ziwu, Cai Zhengcui, Fang Zizhong, Liu Hongyi, Yu Sen, Lai Lun, Su Jiandong, Li Zushen, Li Jingtian, Jin Yueyu, Li Shu, and guests Shui Chongxun, director of the Northwest Supervision Bureau, Li Zufen, manager of the Liuhegou Coal Mine, Yan Shi, director of the Changlai Manganese Mine of Hanyeping Company, and Zhou Qimin and Hu Zijian. The dinner was hosted by engineers Su Jiandong, Shen Maiqun, and Gu Zhiyun of Xinhe Steel Works.</p>
<h3>The Gruel Shop Beauty Values Her Reputation, Shi Fubao is Too Bored</h3>
<p>Zhen Di Almost Wants to End Her Life, Not Admitting Even After Being Slapped</p>
<p>Zhao Zhen Di, the eldest daughter of Zhao Zheng Nan, who runs a gruel shop at No. 304 Xibaoyu Road, Tiantong'an Road, Zhabei, is 19 years old and extremely beautiful, earning her the nickname "Gruel Shop Beauty". She has been betrothed to someone since childhood. However, Shi Fu Bao, a shop assistant (24 years old, from Danyang), wanted to eat swan meat. Zhen Di's beauty was like a peach blossom, aloof and indifferent. Therefore, Shi often teased her with improper words or actions. Around 2 PM on the 7th of this month, Zhen Di went upstairs to call her younger sister. As she walked out of the room, Shi, who was assigned to the night shift that day (the gruel shop operates overnight), was sleeping on the third floor, joking with another shop assistant, Zhang Jingen. Seeing Zhen Di at the door, he deliberately pushed Zhang hard, causing him to fall on Zhen Di. Zhen Di thought that Shi was deliberately insulting her, and slapped him once. Shi harbored resentment and spread rumors in the teahouse, falsely accusing Zhen Di of having an affair with Zhang Jingen, saying that he saw Zhang coming out of her room, etc. Upon hearing this, Zhen Di was so angry that she wanted to end her life and swallowed poison. Fortunately, her family found out and immediately sent her to the hospital for treatment. They then reported the incident to the police, who arrested Shi Fu Bao and sent him to the local court to be prosecuted for defamation. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the court hearing. Zhao and her daughter appeared in court and explained the situation. However, the defendant not only firmly denied the slander, but also did not admit to being slapped. The court ordered the debate to be concluded and will pronounce the sentence at 3 PM on the 30th. The defendant was sent back to custody.</p>

<h3>Fatal Beating to the Cheek Causes Brain Hemorrhage</h3>
<p>Initial Attempt to Resolve Apprentice Quarrel, Deceased's Disobedience Leads to Death</p>
<p>Huang Cai Ji Machine Factory, owned by Huang Wei-cai from Haimen, located at No. 9, Jin Tong Village, Lane 474, Xu Jia Ying Road, French Concession, specializes in manufacturing spring copper locks used on suitcases. It employs over ten copper smiths and apprentices. On the evening of the 25th at 10:15 PM, apprentices Shen Ren-cai (17 years old, from Qi Dong) and Yu Long-cai (15 years old, from Haimen) were cutting copper sheets. Yu accidentally struck Shen's foot with the copper sheet he was holding. Shen immediately stepped on the copper sheet and began to argue. Copper smith Gu Lin-qi (22 years old, from Haimen) stepped forward to mediate and urged them to continue working, but Shen refused to listen. Gu then struck Shen's right cheek with his right hand, hitting his right ear. Shen and Gu went upstairs to complain to the factory owner. After being scolded, they returned downstairs to work. At 11:00 PM, they stopped work and went to bed. Shen felt numbness throughout his body and collapsed while washing his face. Factory owner Huang Wei-cai, along with Gu Lin-qi and another copper smith, Shi Hong-lang, rushed Shen to Guangci Hospital. He died before receiving treatment. Doctors diagnosed that his ear blood vessels ruptured from the beating, causing a brain hemorrhage and death. The hospital reported the case to the French police, who arrested the suspect, Gu Lin-qi. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue for autopsy. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dong Qi-ming from the Special No. 2 Court and a coroner arrived to examine the body. After Central and Western detectives reported their investigation, they interrogated the defendant, Gu Lin-qi. Gu confessed that he struck the deceased's ear because he refused to listen when trying to stop a quarrel between the deceased and another apprentice, Yu Long-cai. The factory owner and copper smith Shi Hong-lang, as witnesses, gave testimonies consistent with the defendant's. However, the deceased's brother, Shen Yuan-jing, claimed that his younger brother was beaten to death for no reason and requested justice, stating that his parents were unable to make arrangements for the funeral. The court ruled that Shen Ren-cai's death was indeed caused by the ear being struck, resulting in brain damage. The body was handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for collection, awaiting relatives to claim it. At 3:00 PM, the police escorted the defendant, Gu Lin-qi, to the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court. Judge Chen Gu-ying interrogated him. Lawyer Yao Zhao-di from the Police Department stated that the defendant was charged with causing death by injury and requested a postponement for further investigation before prosecution. After reviewing the report and questioning the defendant, the court announced a rescheduling of the hearing to 9:00 AM on the 29th and ordered the defendant to be detained.</p>
<h3>Wang He-ying Sues Wu Zhi-hao, Demanding $36,000</h3>
<p>Divorced from Poor Husband to be with Wu, Employed as Teacher, Ultimately Violated, Gives Birth to Yuan-xin, Demanding Support, Hearing Postponed to May 5th with Order to Summon Defendant</p>
<p>Wu Nian-hao from Ningbo once founded the Binbo Industrial Bank and Dashengfu Silk Store, enjoying a period of success. However, due to poor market conditions, his businesses failed, and Wu disappeared from public view. Recently, Wu Zhi-hao was sued by</p>
<p>a woman from Cixi, Ningbo,</p>
<p>Wang He-ying, sixteen years old, along with her four-year-old son, Yuan-xin, who hired lawyer Chen Xing-min to file a lawsuit in the Special No. 1 Court, accusing him of fraudulent marriage, seduction, and abandonment. The lawsuit alleges that the plaintiff's previous husband, Xu Shi-ping, had limited income. She was employed as a teacher at Yangzhi Primary School on Fujian Road. At the time, the defendant was a school trustee. He began</p>
<p>showing concern and care.</p>
<p>They became acquainted. The plaintiff believed that social interactions were open and that male-female relationships were commonplace. However, the defendant harbored ulterior motives. After learning about the plaintiff's family situation, he became increasingly intimate, showering her with gifts and constantly pursuing her. Through various deceptions, boasting of his wealth, he forced her to accompany him for drinks at a restaurant. Feigning attentiveness, amidst the wine and heated atmosphere, the defendant knelt down and confessed his passionate pursuit. The plaintiff,</p>
<p>unaware,</p>
<p>fell into his trap and was ultimately violated. On multiple occasions, she was coerced into illicit acts at hotels. However, their affair was discovered by her former husband, Xu Shi-ping, leading to a major dispute. The defendant then used sweet words to persuade her to divorce her husband quickly, promising to cover all expenses and assuring her of a future of lasting happiness. The plaintiff, in this difficult situation, was powerless to resist and had to obey his arrangements. After much difficulty, the defendant hired a lawyer to provide her with $1,700 in national currency</p>
<p>to resolve the matter completely.</p>
<p>From then on, they separated, each going their own way, filled with tears and regret. She began cohabiting with the defendant. Initially, their relationship was harmonious, but it gradually cooled. They had a son, named Yuan-xin, who is now four years old. The defendant provided her with a Shanghai National Products Company passbook, paying her $100 per month to support their living expenses. However, the defendant abandoned her and neglected to provide support. She had to borrow from various sources. Unable to endure it any longer, she filed a lawsuit with the court,</p>
<p>requesting mediation.</p>
<p>The defendant, aware of his predicament, hired Chen Zhong-gao to mediate and agreed to pay monthly living expenses and settle all debts. The plaintiff, considering their past relationship, reluctantly agreed. However, the defendant soon reverted to his old ways, leaving the plaintiff and her son without means of support. The plaintiff believes that the defendant's actions constitute offenses under Articles 293, Section 1, and 294, Section 1, of the Criminal Code. In addition to requesting legal punishment, she also requests the return of $1,500 in borrowed money and demands that the defendant pay monthly living and</p>
<p>educational expenses</p>
<p>of $100 in national currency until she reaches the age of thirty, totaling $36,000, to be paid in a lump sum. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Ri-sheng presided over the hearing in Court No. 8. The defendant did not appear. The plaintiff, Wang He-ying, along with her son, Yuan-xin, appeared and testified to the above circumstances. Judge Huang ordered the case to be postponed to 2:00 PM on May 5th, ordering the plaintiff to summon the defendant to appear in court for further questioning.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>"Ideal Partner"</h3>
<p>— Fang Ke-wen</p>
<p>There is a Mrs. Robe Kinginsky, a Parisian female writer of Turkish origin. She has traveled around the world three times in search of the "ideal partner" in the world, but she has never found it. When her name and mission first appeared in the newspapers, I thought she would never find it? But coincidentally, the "ideal partner" is said to have been "accidentally" found, and, honored to say, this pair of "ideal partners" are Chinese.</p>
<p>What kind of partners are these "ideal partners"? According to Mrs. Robe Kinginsky, they are: "My 'ideal couple' are Chinese, quite wealthy. They already have three children. The gentleman himself says that he is already fifty years old, but I was surprised to see that he looks at most forty years old. As for his wife," she is not very beautiful, but the beautiful contours of her face, combined with her hair, caught my attention. Her fashionable black silk cheongsam, decorated with milky white trim, made her figure look very outstanding and elegant. No one would believe that she is already forty years old." The profession and names of this "ideal partner" are said to not trust reporters, so they refused to announce them.</p>
<p>The reason for their "great happiness" is that "My wife and I, every three months we close ourselves in the house for a week. During this period, we do not speak to each other, nor to other people." And the reason is that "The mechanism of the human brain, because of daily thinking and short periods of sleep, is not enough to restore its original strength. Similarly, a car, after driving a long distance of one hundred and twenty miles per hour, needs rest to restore its original mechanism. The mechanical action between husband and wife is more complicated than that of machines, so more advanced adjustments are needed."</p>
<p>This statement is really novel. "This method of natural philosophy," is said to be implementable by every couple, "but cannot be applied to poor clerks, factory workers, and those who are busy for life." The intention of this limitation is quite ingenious, and conversely, it can also be said that "people who are busy for life" "don't have to think about the life of an 'ideal partner' in their entire lives."</p>
<p>The Chinese are a mystery in the eyes of foreigners, and this probably includes Mrs. Robe Kinginsky; and in recent years, foreigners seem to be more eager to understand the mysterious China, so books about China are quite popular. Chinese marriage problems, because of the difference in systems, have also become one of the mysteries; and now the discovered "ideal partner" just happens to be Chinese, and their "method" is so "interesting", just like a riddle. It is not necessary to say that foreigners who do not understand China will find it novel and interesting, even we Chinese, like me, are also surprised at how surprisingly "ideal" this pair of "ideal partners" is! And Mrs. Robe Kinginsky's methods are so clever that she even describes this pair of "ideal partners" as "mysterious figures, unwilling to announce their names, and even unwilling to show their photos to others."</p>
<p>It is expected that when Mrs. Robe Kinginsky publishes her book "Traveling Around the World to Find Ideal Marriage", it will definitely be a bestseller and she will return with a full load.</p>
<p>Let us wish Mrs. Robe Kinginsky success! And we Chinese will inevitably become more of a "mystery" in the hearts of foreigners.</p>
<h3>Killing a Substitute Pig</h3>
<p>— Xiang Yang</p>
<p>That old woman who had been sick for a whole year was now lying stiffly on the bed, her breath weak and her eyes rolling gently under her wrinkled skin. Her trembling left hand waved weakly. The young peasant, her son, said piously,</p>
<p>"Mother, what are you doing?"</p>
<p>"You, you slaughter one of the little pigs in our pen and invite someone to kill a substitute pig tonight."</p>
<p>As soon as the sun set, the son invited a one-eyed man with an apricot-yellow package on his back. The man's pale gray, withered braid was coiled on top of his head. He was nearly fifty years old, thin and bony, with a pair of eyes that were frighteningly large. Walking into the house, he rolled his eyes around, glancing at the Judge's portrait facing the door, as if something was hidden behind the paper. He pasted a yellow paper with red characters on the door frame. The night wind blowing from the courtyard made it flutter and rustle.</p>
<p>The patient's son placed the incense altar in the middle of the room, lit half-foot-high red candles, and filled the incense burner with a handful of elm incense. The one-eyed man waved his hand, telling the man to step out, leaving him alone. He used a stack of yellow money to wrap a piece of God-inviting tablet, burning it on the flickering flame, kneeling straight on the ground, muttering incoherently for a while. Standing up again, he took out a small bird-shaped ox horn tube from his belt, playing it in a sorrowful tune, all the while spreading his legs and running towards the fields.</p>
<p>The villagers, in the quiet night when there was nothing to do, had already gone to bed early. Occasionally, one or two windows still shone with dim lights, and the old woman inside spinning the spinning wheel heard the ghostly, eerie, sharp sound of the horn, and with a puff, blew out the lamp. The one-eyed man ran in circles around the village, his hurried footsteps rustling through the weeds. The dogs behind the fences barked, one provoking the other. Before long, the sleeping children were also frightened and cried. When he walked back to the house with staggering steps, panting, the candlelight had dimmed, the incense had burned to ash, and the colored smoke core still stood upright in the candle flame. He took the piglet that was groaning weakly from the trembling young farmer's hands, wrapped it head and brain in a new red foreign cloth, and placed it flat on the center of the low table in front of the incense altar. He put his hands on his hips, staring at the dark roof with his fierce eye, and recited:</p>
<p>"Don't look at the golden face, look at the Buddha's face, don't look at the Buddha's face, look at the immortals, let her live for a few more decades, exchange a life to pay for the nine springs. …"</p>
<p>After a vague prayer, he stomped his feet wildly, jumping around like crazy. Just as he circled the pig's head, he pulled out a bright and dazzling seven-inch short knife from a small knife holder sewn from red and green cloth. His left hand twisted the black furry pig ear, and the little pig screamed miserably, its four small legs tied with rope, constantly kicking and rubbing in the red cloth. He used the back of the knife to bite it horizontally with his teeth, and with the other hand he lifted the pig's tail, circling around the patient's bed like a whirlwind. When he stood back by the low table, he recited the incantation loudly, tapping the knife rhythmically on the table for a while. At this time, the candlelight became even dimmer, with only a star of red light still flickering in the house.</p>
<p>The one-eyed man used the knife tip to tap on the chopping board, then reached out and patted the top of the pig's head, and with a sudden stab, pierced into the palate from the throat. A short and mournful cry was heard, and blood flowed from the table to the ground. The house was immersed in a ghostly shadow. He walked to the incense table, raised the bloody knife, knelt down on one leg, shouted loudly, turned around and tore off the paper banner on the door frame.</p>
<p>The young farmer walked out in fear, moved the incense table, tied up the ill-fated piglet with ropes, and thanked the one-eyed man for his hard work, while handing over the piglet. The blind man hurriedly packed his yellow bag, the ox horn tube hanging under his neck, holding the little life that had died in his hands, a terrifying smile on his purple-yellow skinny face, left the courtyard, supported himself with his sharp knife, and disappeared into the endless darkness.</p>
<p>The door slammed shut. The young farmer walked back to the house, stepping timidly to the bedside to take a look, calling out "Mother," but she was quietly motionless and did not answer. He thought she might have fallen asleep, but when he touched the old woman's hands and face, everything was cold, and the last trace of breath had disappeared from her nostrils.</p>
<h3>Appetite</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<h3>Loneliness</h3>
<p>"Do you know today's rivers and mountains,</p>
<p>How many sad tears?</p>
<p>Think about it! Yes, yes, yes!"</p>
<p>Tonight, I've heard this song three times already. What a lonely song! The first time was the day after I moved in, when it was raining outside the window, a time when God makes things difficult for every lonely traveler; the second time was half a day ago, when the night was deep and the noise of the city had long subsided. I was lying quietly in bed, looking at the moonlight that poured onto the floor through the window curtains. At that time, the song took away my sleep and tears. I believe there is no more melancholic song in the world, especially on quiet nights, on quiet nights with a moon.</p>
<p>A young man's curiosity led me to ask the concierge the next day:</p>
<p>"Who was singing last night?" "Maybe it was that Korean, did he bother you?</p>
<p>We hate this person, he is about to move out, he owes three months' rent, he is a perverse and dirty person who doesn't bathe all year round and doesn't speak."</p>
<p>I turned my face away, and the concierge walked away on his own. This conversation only increased my confusion and bewilderment.</p>
<p>Tonight, I parted the window curtains. It was another moonlit night, and it was rare to see such a good moon in the city. So I opened the door and walked onto the balcony, relying on the row of gray railings that had been weathered for a long time, sinking into the sands of memory.</p>
<p>I really don't want anyone to disturb the tranquility of this night. I want to be submerged in the ocean of memory, listening to the whispers of the past, letting the night dew embed itself in my hair. But at this moment, I heard a sigh, as low as if I heard it in a dream. I turned my head and saw that someone was doing the same as me. Leaning on the railing, he raised his head and looked at the bright moon shining on the desolate wilderness.</p>
<p>We stared at each other silently for a while.</p>
<p>"A lonely person," I said to myself.</p>
<p>However, I heard the song again, it was a mournful whisper.</p>
<p>"Do you know today's rivers and mountains,</p>
<p>Are there few sad tears?"</p>
<p>He stroked his hair, closed his eyes, and trembled all over.</p>
<p>"Do you know who you are?</p>
<p>Do you know that time is like water!</p>
<p>Do you know that the autumn sounds add a bit of haggardness?</p>
<p>Fatherland! Drooping! Drooping! Drooping! …"</p>
<p>"Drooping! Drooping! Drooping!" He lengthened his final sound, shaking his head constantly, and then he returned to his room in a confused and erratic manner.</p>
<p>I saw a patch of water stains left on the gray railing, shining in the moonlight. It was the tears of a person without a homeland! Then he turned off the electric light in his room, and the moonlight on the balcony became even more gloomy. "Do you know today's rivers and mountains…"</p>
<p>I wanted to learn to sing like him, but I couldn't make a sound, my throat was already hoarse.</p>
