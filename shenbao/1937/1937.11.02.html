<h3>頑敵又有兩處渡河陳家渡侯家埭激戰終日</h3>
<p>經我軍包圍痛勦後勢已大挫　敵猛烈犯小南翔找陣地無損　施相公廟我守原綫並未西移</p>
<p>敵軍自前晨起、沿蘇州河梵皇鐵橋迤西、至申紀浜（卽姚家渡）北岸一綫、屢次渡河、均被我軍擊退、但北新涇及周家橋兩處、在其大砲與姻幕掩護之下、卒被強渡過河、經我軍包圍痛擊後、已全部肅清、迨昨晨三時許、敵又由中山路橋附近偷渡過河、竟有敵軍約二十餘人衝到農田紗廠附近陣地、旋經我軍數度衝擊、立即潰退、至午十一時、敵又從陳家渡、侯家埭二地偷渡、攻我劉家宅、吳家庫陣地、從陳家渡偷渡之敵約百餘人、經我軍圍剿、斃敵甚多、尚有少數殘部在掙扎中、侯家宅偷渡之敵約三百餘人、被我軍嚴密包圍、至今晨（二日）三時、戰事更烈、敵已不支、當可限時肅淸、至於中路江橋至小南翔之綫、昨日午後二時、敵又集中陸空之力、向我小南翔及塘橋角等陣地猛攻、但我陣地鞏固異常、並未受損、至晚猶在激戰中、左翼施相公廟之綫、自我軍新陣綫佈置完成後、已取得密切聯絡、敵雖數度來犯、但我方陣綫、絕無變動、亦未西移、</p>
<h3>敵昨又渡河南犯</h3>
<p>激戰終日我正包園解决</p>
<p>滬戰重心、移至滬西後、三日來蘇州河兩岸砲火不絕、前日敵曾在周家橋•陳家渡•等處渡河來犯、經我殱減後、昨日午前十一時、又在陳家渡•·侯家埭•兩處偷渡、激戰終日、據中央社隨軍記者昨晚十一時半報告、迄晚止、敵勢已挫、我軍正加以包圍解决、其戰况如下、</p>
<h3>陳家渡百人經痛擊</h3>
<p>昨日淸晨起、敵軍以重砲向我南岸陣地猛轟、敵機亦活動異常、惟投彈不多、陳家渡方面、敵建有帆布橋一座、我軍正設法破壞時、敵軍於上午十一時、又施放烟慕、由橋渡來、但數僅百餘、我軍當由劉家宅出擊、斃敵甚多、入晚後尚有少數殘部、退至北岸之處掙扎、不久卽可解決、</p>
<h3>侯家埭三百被包圍</h3>
<p>同時在北新涇西北約二公里之侯家埭一帶、敵亦在烟幕下偷波、且進行建橋、其法甚簡、以帆布一端紮於北岸、而用汽艇拖至對岸紮住、卽告完成、該處被敵渡過約三百餘、分向我屈家橋•姚家宅•全綫進犯、經我奮擊、將敵壓迫西退、敵集中兵力猛犯、吳家庫廰頭二據點、致為其佔據、旋我軍反攻、於晚六時許、已將廰頭方面敵軍這去、而將吳家庫之敵包圍勦擊、限時肅淸、</p>
<h3>前日敵軍完全消滅</h3>
<p>又悉、前日在周家橋方面渡河者、原有三百人、在中途經我砲擊、得獲渡至南岸者、僅百餘人、我該處民房甚多、敵卽散伏其中、剿擊頗為不易、故卽用火攻、將有敵軍盤據之房屋、均付一炬、尚餘二三十人、向河岸竄逃、匿伏岸邊、我機槍射擊無效、卽派敢死隊蛇行至岸旁、以手溜彈猛擲、將其殲滅、我檢查敵軍屍體、係屬陸軍第三師第六聯隊、</p>
<p>又據另一報告、右冀方面、敵軍自前晨起至昨晨拂曉止、於二十四小時內、沿蘇州河梵皇鐵橋迤西、至申紀浜（卽姚家渡）北岸一綫、不斷南攻、我軍在南岸憑堅固守、敵軍屢次渡河、均被我軍擊退、但北新涇及周家橋兩處、在其大砲與烟幕掩護之下、卒被強渡過河、但人數不多、昨晚經我軍包圍痛擊後、業已全部肅淸、南岸已無敵踪、計北新徑奪獲步槍五六十枝、周家橋二三十枝、生還者無幾、餘均落河而死、迨今晨三時許、敵以上述兩處完全失敗、心不甘服、遂調遺步兵約一中隊之眾、由中山路橋附近偷渡過河、當被我軍機槍火力壓退、但當時曾有一小部敵軍約二十餘人被其衝到農田紗廠附近陣地、旋經我軍數度衝擊、彼以立足未穩、立卽潰退、我奪獲步槍十餘枝、拂曉後、敵軍僅以大砲轟擊、我軍沉着應戰、屹不為助、截至午時止、雙方均在隔河對峙中、</p>
<h3>敵軍猛犯小南翔</h3>
<p>相持至晚我陣地無變動</p>
<p>中央社南翔隨軍記者一日晚十二時報告、敵軍西犯南翔之計劃、迄未放棄、我軍亦戒備周密、本日午後二時、敵經多日之準備果以六千餘之步兵、在陸空聯合之砲火下、猛烈進犯、正面攻我小南翔、兩翼並進攻我塘橋角及土地堂、火綫長達二公里、我軍陣地、經二日之修補、鞏固異常、雖在敵集中砲火下、仍完好無損、故相持至晚、我陣地毫無變動、敵以進取心切、故猛撲而來、我亦迎擊、遂入於激戰、預料明日當有更激烈之主力戰、</p>
<h3>施相公廟我軍陣地未西移</h3>
<p>中央社廣福隨軍記者晉謁負責指揮左翼軍之某高級參謀、據鄭重聲明、該軍自八月二十三日至九月七日、與敵在羅店經數度劇戰後、於九月八日始將陣地稍向後移、在施相公廟東側附近與敵相持、直至目前、敵雖屢次進犯、但我陣地毫無變動、北次右翼陣地雖有新布置、惟與左翼隨時取得密切聯絡、故並無影饗、前傳施相公廟陣地曾向西移動之說、則屬不確、</p>
<h3>敵由眞如西犯未逞</h3>
<p>經我迎戰斃敵四百餘　獲野砲三門機槍十五</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者一日午前十－時報告、昨夜十一時、敵軍二聯隊由真如方面沿店浦槎浦西進、向我江橋鎭前李家巷•積善庵．警戒陣地進犯、經我派某某兩部迎戰、反覆衝鋒五六次、至今日上午、將敵鑿退、是役斃敵四百餘、並奪獲野砲三門、機槍十五挺、</p>
<h3>敵增援軍到三千餘</h3>
<p>又續到魚雷艦一艘　傷兵八百啟椗返國</p>
<p>昨晨六時許、續有敵商輪改建之運輸艦銃波丸•廣德丸•一九八號運輸艦Ume丸•等三艘、相繼駛滬、分靠黃涌碼頭、招商局北棧•及大阪碼頭、下午二時左右、又有敵四三號運輸艦空智丸駛到、停靠於大阪碼頭、以上四艦、共計載來敵第六次增援軍之第六批、合約三千餘人、此外昨日並續有敵運輸艦Iro號Nojima號商輪改建之一三五號運輸艦等三艘駛滬、分靠招商局北棧及虬江碼頭、載來軍火甚多、上列各艦、其中Ume丸及ro號二艘、已於昨日下午四時左右離滬返日、其餘各艦、仍分泊浦江、</p>
<p>中央社云、確息、浦江內原泊有敵魚雷艦二艘、一名Okinosbima、泊虬江碼頭、一名Iyskushima、泊九號浮筒、昨日下午三時左右、又有名號不明之敵魚雷艦一艘駛滬、停泊八號浮筒、以上三艦、皆滿載魚雷、至駛滬用意、則不得而知云、此外並有敵運輸艦二艘、於昨晨七時左右、相繼駛滬、分靠招商局北棧及虬江碼頭、載來砲彈步槍彈及共他軍用節無算云、</p>
<p>前日載來軍火之敵輸上海丸、於停靠匯山碼頭、將軍火起卸完竣後、昨日復換載敵傷乓八百餘人、於下午三時左右、啟椗返日、</p>

<h3>敵機在浦束肆虐</h3>
<p>昨日下午三時許、有敵機六架、分為兩隊、在浦東陸家渡·楊家濟•張家浜一帶、槃旋窺察、輪流投彈達十餘枚之多、毀我民房十餘間、至五時左右、該敵機始逸去、又同時有敵機一架、在南市第十六號碼頭及浦東瀾泥渡一帶低飛、用機槍掃射、幸該地居民早巳避入安全地帶、未有死傷云、</p>
<h3>崑山擊落敵機</h3>

<p>三十日上午、敵三發動重轟炸機數度飛至崑山轟炸、當經我高射砲轟射、擊落一架、已誌前報、茲據續訊、墮落敵機、機身完整、俘獲機關槍兩挺、無綫電一架、及駕駛員五名、餘二名逃匿、現正在搜索中、</p>
<h3>孤軍團附謝晉→兀接見中外記者</h3>
<p>暢談退出閘北經過　苦守四晝夜斃敵一百餘名　參加戰役十餘年經驗豐富</p>
<p>我第八十八師二六二旅五二四團團附謝晉元、於奉最高當局命令退出閘北最後陣地後、現該團除營長楊瑞符及受傷軍士、已入醫院醫治外、謝團附及其餘兵士、均已到達安全地帶、卽可再開赴前綫、繼續殺敵、申時社記者昨訪謝團附於某處、當時適有路透社記者•及法文日報社記者·字林西報記者•等亦往訪間、茲誌謝團附對記者談話如次、</p>
<p>日方謠言絕不可信</p>
<p>外報記者、首訽自我閘北孤軍進出四行倉庫堆棧後、據日方宣傳、謂在日兵入內時、搜查堆棧房屋內、有我士兵屍體百餘具、是否確實、據答、敵文宣傳、完全不確、四行堆棧內、除有若干沙袋外、並無如許屍體、我在內士軍、共為四百二十名、徹退時為三百七十七人、共中除有十餘名已殉難外、餘者受傷入醫院療治中、而敵方被我孤軍所擊斃者、確有一百名以上、因敵方不知我究竟有多少官兵、故信日造謠、絕不可信、</p>
<p>機槍三架掩護撒退</p>
<p>至於撤退之經過、據謝談、係於三十日晚九時、奉到命令、當時卽命令全體凖備殺敵、但並未告以徹退、蓋當時本國全體官兵、均決心與此最從陣地共存共亡、當時敵方在前、機關槍聲、密切異常、至一時後稍緩、本團卽乘此時機衝山、以三架機關檢掩護、敵方始終未敢追近、我得以安全退出、但敵方士兵作戰能力之薄弱、於此可見、苟常時敵敢迫近衝我、則我當亦不能如是安全出入矣</p>
<p>稍事休息再赴前綫</p>
<p>最後、謝氏以全體官兵對於抗敵情緒、均興奮異常、決待梢事休息後繼續往前綫殺敵、謝氏為廣東省籍、現年三十三歲、家屬現在廣東、有子女各二、謝氏畢業於黃埔軍校第五期、出校後卽參加革命軍北伐、至今已歷十餘年、各次戰役、均曾參加、對作戰經驗、甚為豐富、</p>
<h3>廣福陳家行一帶殉職三將領略歷</h3>
<p>上月下旬、在廣福與陳家行－帶、敵我曾賺開前所罕有之壯戰、雙方死傷、俱甚嚴重、我旅長秦霖•龐漢楨•團長謝鼎新•等三人、皆以身殉、茲將三將士略歷、附誌於后、用寄哀思、藉資紀念、</p>
<p>秦霖　秦霖、字沛然、廣西桂林人、中央軍校第一分校高級班第三期畢業、曾參加北伐各戰役、為人忠毅勇敢、灣宅之役‵以身殉難、年僅三十六歲、為現代一有為之青下軍人也、惡耗傳來時、全軍無不涕泣、</p>
<p>龐漢楨　字應中、廣西靖西人、年三十八歲、中央軍校第一分校高級班第二期畢業、化伐時、歷充團營長等職、為人沉靜剛直、勇敢有為、談家頭之役亦以身殉、</p>
<p>謝鼎新　廣西容縣人、貧充十九路軍旅團長等職、一二八淞滬抗戰、亦曾參與、為人勇敢善戰、陳家行之役、率領所部、浴血衝擊、予敵重創、但謝團長亦遂以身殉、</p>
<h3>戰區雜寫（二）</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>誰也不會健忘吧；一二八英勇抗戰的十九路軍，苦戰一月零二日，正博得世人高喝采聲，勢望益切的時候，突聞睛天霹震，他們忽退守第二道防綫了。不用說，這是受了瀏河偷渡上岸的影響了！</p>
<p>反之，此次八一三發動的上海區抗戰，敵軍用最優勢的兵力，海陸空一致向我壓迫，殘暴瘋狂，無所不用其極，八十日來不知付了參少代價，然後才於中央綫梢有進展。瀏河守軍防綫，固如金湯，使敵軍屢欲抄襲一二八老文章，都歸失敗，這不能不說是瀏河守軍的一大功勞吧！</p>
<p>誠然，瀏河固守之功，是很的得歌頌的。可惜那裹比較僻達，往返不易，很少有人去訪問，同時在那裏負責任，獨當一方的xxx先生，他是將門之裔，兼擅詩文，素以“權利看淸，生死看明”八字自矢，遇事尤能埋頭苦幹，不求聞達。於是關於瀏河方面光榮的抗戰經過，就極少見到有系統文宇發表。</p>
<p>全血抗戰未發生以前，記者在沿某地訪晤x先生，談到國防問題，他認為物質精神，均極重要。有時物質建設，恐為對。象所破壞，便須於訓練艮眾，組織民眾的精神國防，。多所努力。但這絕非一紙標語，便可奏效；因標語如藥方，不經良醫的精密審察，或審察而不實際服用，都是無濟於事的。這話並非終的放矢，目前民眾力量，不能與軍事力量配合，即正坐此弊。但是蘊藏極富的民眾力量，畢竟是支持持久抗戰的最偉火的基石，縱是臨渴掘井，也亟應把它開發使用出來才好。無</p>
<p>敵軍有一度由用沙河口乘處上陸，我軍猛勇將彼擊退，雙方傷亡，各五六百人•近來敵軍雖也不時進犯，但我防禦陣地，固如金湯，且士兵戰鬬經騐，愈打愈豐富，愈打愈起勁，甚至有兩師人，連換防休息都不願，致敵每次來攻，無有受重創而潰。總計兩日以來，先後斃敵校尉官以下級士兵，確數達二千餘名、跳水死的不在內）。敵之台灣守備隊重籐支隊，目全被殲減，無一生還者。</p>
<p>不過敵人因屢次失敗，竟敢於本月十一日企圖登岸時，施放毒氣。幸因當晚風勢很大，未曾奏效。後在江邊淸掃陣地，又得敵軍所遣毒氣彈箱一支，除已施放者外，僅餘－枚。暴敵如此不顧國際公法，實乃自速其亡之兆！</p>
<p>敵軍還有所謂五年計劃，可動員八百萬人的狂論，但據我某軍事家觀察，恐盡彼國所有壯丁，完全驅諸戰傷，也絕不能得此鉅數。而況經此戰役之後（浙滬一區，作戰兩月餘，彼傷亡即遠六萬以上，華北當較此為烈），任如何嵬羅鑿盡，恐動員一百萬人，也是難乎其難的了。至於我國人數，必愈來愈多，至少可動員一千萬以上。人口壯丁之比較，也是近代作戰軍實估計之一重要部門，我優彼劣，最後勝利，自䍩必屬於我！</p>
<h3>敵軍以廢票强索物品</h3>

<p>對於這些事實、我們毫不驚奇、祇是日本海盜登陸後、﹁以前在金之台人嚮導下鄕、﹂這件事、覺得萬分痛恨，日寇滅亡了我們台灣、仇恨巳如海深、血債如積得如山、現在父想滅亡我們祖先的家鄕、華南、我們散居在華南的台灣同胞、祇有馬上自動武裝起來、參加祖國抗日的統一戰綫、向日本強盜衝鋒、保衛家鄕華南．保衛中華、爭取民族的自由解放、不料竟有些喪心病狂的人、恬不知恥的甘心做走狗、做敵人的內應、難道幾十年來亡國奴的生括、還不夠受嗎、難道要永遠的做日本奴才、不想站立起來、做一個自由的人嗎、</p>
<p>我們知道金廈是華南門戶和屏障、一旦被敵人完全佔領、閩粵便發生了極嚴重的危機、受到淪亡的威脅、更可怕的是奴隸生活、將要無限的延長下去、我們祖先墳墓田地、也將變成日寇的屠塲、</p>
<p>時候是萬分追急了、絕不容我們再有絲毫遲疑、因循自誤、留居華南的台灣同胞、必須立刻武裝起來、粉碎敵人的陰謀和侵略、為保衛我們的祖先的家鄕、華南而鬥爭、為保衛金廈而鬥爭、</p>

<p>顧大使言調整最低限度　遵守修約保障領土完整　會議工作擬分兩步進行</p>
<p>［巴黎］出席九國公約會議中國首席代表顧維鈞氏今日聲稱、中國固願中日戰爭得因各國之調解而終止、但日本非尊重其對九國公約所發之諾言不可、中國凖備出席會議、凖備接受合於國際公法之和平解决辦法、總之、以九國公約會議為基礎之調解辦怯、中國凖傭接受之、我人所堅决要求者、為民族國家之生存、顧氏又謂、凡日本所建議之直接交涉、中國不欲為之、我人决對國聯與九國公約致其始終不渝之誠、故認為一切和平之建議、非循此二途徑不可、中國今日所處地位、卽係被侵略之地位、日本不獨破壞九國公約而危害中國之生存、同時更蹂躪其他簽約國之地位也、顧氏又表示、彼十分盼望會議之成功、唯對日本之不肯出席、表示失望、並謂、日本此種昂岸態度、可謂其蔑視其所簽條約之又一蹬明、此種不能尊重條約之行動、不獨當事之中國大受其害、實與世界之安全有極大之關係、故今日之日本對華問題、絕非一偶之問題、而為國際社會及文化存滅之大問題、於今日而欲求和平與安全、我人非先恢復條約義務之恪守不可、此一原則、若不能重行確立、則世界必無和平之可能、文化亦必更無存績之希望也、（一日國民電）</p>
<p>比京　九國公約會議美國代表團今日聲明、解决中日戰事之任何調解計劃、苟非為中國完全接受者、美國决不贊成、另息、美國人士對於休戰問題、難甚關切、然目下業已决定拒絕一切予中國以不利之和平辦法、唯假使九國公約會議能制止中日戰爭、或擬另開一種會議、以謀還東問題之完全解决、此種會議是否有必要、各國代表皆無成見、惟就其初步談話而觀、英法美諸國或將贊助此種計劃、因此種會議或能奠定保障中國自由之基石、而確保歐美各國在遠東之利益也、此後或將另訂一種新絛約、以代現行之九國公約及華府海約、亦未可知、（三十一日國民電）</p>
<p>比京　今日據可靠方面消息、九國公約會議調解中日戰事之舉、或將因中國要求該約簽字諸國對日採取共同行動、而告失敗、中國要求、聞將以九國公約保障中國領土完整政治獨立之規定為根據、此舉將使英美法代表大感棘手、蓋三國事前已經商定、九國公約會議應先使中日停戰、然後開始談判、以謀諦造永久和平、據美代表團消息、議事日程大致規定、首先兩日由各國代表發表演說、然後請中國代表說明可以接受停戰之條什、然後再向日本另發請柬、使之出席會議、說明日本立塲及解决條件、假使日本再拒絕出席、則各國分頭向日本探明停戰條件、中日態度明白之後、各國再於會議席上用調解方法、尋求折衷方案、惟據現狀觀之、中日態度大相懸殊、調和頗為因難云、（一日國民電）</p>

<h3>蘇俄期待美國甚殷</h3>
<p>李維諾夫率代表團赴比京　太平洋學會主張經濟制裁</p>
<p>［莫斯科］蘇聯政府自接受比國邀請應允參加九國公約會議之後、當任命外交人民委員長季維諾夫．副委員長波丹金．駐比公使魯彬寗為代表、李維諾夫與波丹金二人頃於晚間十時啟程前往白魯塞爾、比國駐蘇聯公使萊戴利埃與蘇聯政府要人多名均在車站歡送、據蘇聯政界人士宣稱、蘇聯代表團此次出席會議、對於美國態度屬望甚深、並認為日本對華侵略行動欲予以制止實惟美國是賴、蓋以英國對於任何折衷方案、凡足以維護該國在華利益者、均凖備加以贊助而不擬再有更進一多之行動、此在美國則羅斯福總統與赫爾國務卿均曾發表演說、對於日本侵略行動加以譴責、並說明美國未便長此保持孤立態度、蘇聯政界人士對於此項態度均表好感、並以為美國輿論傾向孤立主義者雖仍大有人在、所望羅斯福與赫爾兩氏坐而言者能起而行耳、此外蘇聯代表團在九國公約會議席上對於愛好和平各國必須組成聯合陳綫、以對付侵略國一項主張、定必加以支持、特關於此層、蘇聯是否自行提出具體建議則尚無可知、（中央社卅一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>加拿大托倫多　太平洋學會總幹事卡德今日在此作公開演說、謂九國公約會議如不能發起對日施行經濟制裁、則遠東之和平或將延緩三四年、始能實現、卡氏引英國經濟學家凱恩斯之言云、﹁經濟制裁至少有十分之九可收實效、而其成功對於目前及將來皆大有價值﹂、至於意阿之戰、未因制裁而停止、則卡氏以為意國為大陸國家、而日木則為島國、當可加以封鎖、惟經濟制裁為最後之一步、必項俟外交方法完全失敗之後、始應實施云、（三十一日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］據此間經濟學者今日觀察、日本工業此後是否讀有開展、當以此次對華戰爭為關鍵、日本此次對華戰爭、為其打破鎖國狀態以來進入上業時代之最高峯、設日本於此次戰爭之中、國家經濟力量並不耗竭、而在華獲得最後之勝利、則其工業自必仍為長足之躍進、而危及世界各國之商業、反之、日本若為中國戰敗、或國內經濟力量耗竭而進入虛脫狀態、則各國對於日貨之競爭、卽可無所用其憂慮矣、（三十一日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］素以艾登外相喉舌見稱之﹁約克夏郵報﹂頃登載一文、評論九國公約會議、謂﹁美國代表台維斯此次出席會議、關係極為重要、所惜九國公約會議開幕之前、各方空氣頗為黯淡、意相墨索里尼决定不派遺外長齊亞諾山席九國公約會議、此其一也、意國政府召回駐法大使賽呂蒂、此其二也、比利時政潮始終不定、此其三也、西班牙內戰不干濘問題之解决、再遲延、此其四也、有此種種、故九國公約會議前途、殊多不吉之兆、雖然、會議目的不在提供外交談話之機會、而在發見何種方法、以使中國境內戰事迅速終止、此為吾人之所熟知、抑羅斯福總統之親信台維斯此次正式代表美國出席會議、其關係尤非等閒可比、艾登外相日內卽將前往比京、大約渠將在九國公約會議開幕之前、乘機與台維斯會晤、俾就遠東時局有所商談﹂云（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>悼英軍四義士</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>當今日本軍閥正在用殘暴的侵略手段破壞着世界的正義和平。最可寶貴的就是維護正義人道的英勇的戰士。上海的英國駐軍在侵略者的飛機大砲亂轟亂炸的狀况之下。始終堅毅地守衛着租界防區不給侵略者絲毫的方便。因此近幾天來。英軍中間籣直天天有着死傷。而白利南路四戰士的殉難尤其是轟動世界的悲劇、可是這也使世界的正義精神愈加發揚了。</p>
<p>除了正義精神以外。上海英駐軍所表顯的人道精神。也是使我們深深地感佩的。在這里就摘取一段記載。(見二十八日本報)作為例證罷。那是描寫英國兵在梵王渡橋援助難民的光景的。“………他們捲起袖管用那粗壯多毛的手臂從橋的彼端一次次的一手抱着一兩個正在駭得哭的孩子。一手扶着或抱着龍鍾的老婦或無力行走的婦人們走過橋來。一担担代難民們把衣被或食米挑過橋來。他們流着汗。一次一次。我在那邊的二小時中他們始終是那麼像對自己的家人般眞誠地對難民們援手。我親眼看見難民們對他們感激得落下淚來。我親耳聽見難民們由衷地訴說的感謝話。我知他們雖然不懂得。却也並不是希望人們的謝詞。我第一次看見眞眞的“人”。</p>
<p>我們永遠忘不掉上海英軍這一種維護正義人道的精神。因此上月廿九日那天敵人的砲彈所造成的白利南路的悲劇。也就不能不使我們感泣着。昨日英國四義士擧殯時。我國數十機關團體派代表執紼致敬。正是十分適切的表示。我們覺得這四位義士的軀売雖已埋在地下了。他們的殉道精神可還長留在全世界擁護正義人道的無數人們的心頭。他們的死是不朽的。</p>

<h3>故都陷落後之形形色色（一）</h3>
<p>— 朱鏡心</p>
<p>七十餘日見聞記</p>
<p>自七月七日夜、蘆溝橋畔砲聲突起後、中日戰端、逐漸開展、迄二十七日廊房（平津間之重要車站）衝突、遞演成平郊抗戰二十八日深夜、守軍移防南下、我歷代故都之北平、遂落於敵手、百六十萬同胞、亦淪落於敵軍鐵蹄之下、度其非人生活、記者於事變後因各種困難、未能即時南奔、因得目睹失陷後故都各項狀况、前後歷時七十餘日、頃始于本月九日潛行逃出繞道大津靑島濟南徐州鄭州等地、於昨日抵漢、茲將目擊各情、略述如左、</p>
<p>一、漢奸大肆活動</p>
<p>故都爲北方政治中心冀察政務委員會原設於此、七月二十八日晚宋哲元决定離平、當發表以張自忠代理委員長職務、並兼任北平市長、負責處理一切、二十九軍部隊、除留阮玄武一旅、改名保安隊、留守北平、協同警察、維持地方外、餘均全部開出、同時並發表潘毓桂爲警察局長、張潘等於八月一日同時就職、當潘氏就職時、會謂日軍决不入城（潘與日方關係甚深、仟冀察政務處長時、即因此解職）、至八月二日、日方通知張自忠、令阮部即時解除武裝、開往黃寺待命、致張赤手空拳、無法負責、旋於五日被迫離職、地方遂呈無政府狀態、僅由警察局暫時維持、</p>
<p>漢奸之活動、遠在蘆溝橋事變之前、事變發生後、實力派主戰、漢奸派主和、及戰端開始漢奸經遂大肆活動、前北平商會會長冷家驥、前湖南省長周肇祥等、邀同所謂地方名宿、應時而起、每日奔走於日特務機關之門、以大好河山、爲彼等升官發財之禮物、宋哲元氏離平、即係彼等假日機將大舉轟炸北平、請顧念一百六十萬人民生命財產爲名、請其離去、嗣以目的旣達、遂有新組織之醖釀、先以地方維持會爲掠奪政權之初步、冷週等以資望不孚、恐難得日方許可、乃威誘前淸遺老江朝宗出山任會長、江以年老之軀不堪重任、曾一度謙辭，實則食指早已怦動、維持會開始辦公之期、爲八月十日、彼等則宣告於八月一日成立、當聘請大批日人爲顧問、强拉各界名士任委員顧問等職、復以北平市長一職、自張自忠被迫去位後、虛懸已久、冷潘等莫不覬覦、每日奔走活動、但日人以彼等市井流俗、難勝重任、乃授意維持會、假借民意、公推江朝宗兼任市長、各局局長亦一律更換、大小漢奸遂得一過官癮、地痞流氓、居然高官顯職、如工務局長李季思、原任某路局科員、每日赴局當差、下午出任局長、奇形怪狀、笑話百出、而每日筫綠奔走者、仍不乏其人、魑魅魍魎、行同鬼蜮、忝顏事仇、亳無羞愧之色、實則各機關大權皆操於日籍顧問之手、各機關之行政收支以及用人、雖一文之微、如不經簽字許可、亦無效力、雖如此情形、但漢奸輩爭權奪利之心、仍高騰萬丈、例如電車公司爲平市收入較佳營業、江朝宗即以維持會名義、委本人任董事長、各委員任理監事、經日人面斥阻止、方自行收回成命、其不知人間羞恥事、至此可謂達於極點、漢奸集團之維持會外、另一部漢奸如許蘭州等、則於八月二十七日成立所謂“華北人民目治會、”與維持會互爭賣國作倀之優先權、最近更有一部漢奸、組織大亞細亞同盟、亦爲爭權奪利之機關、醖釀設立華北僞政府、置民衆於萬刦不復之地、</p>
<p>漢奸謟媚日方、各有不同、煞費苦心、即如此次北平於事變中未罹戰禍、一部漢奸、即歸功於日軍、乃以保護生命財產之美名、自稱代表、求見日特務機關長松井、面爲陳述、要求爲彼代建銅像於天安門之前、松井懼彼邦之蜚言、當即加以拒絕、彼輩必猶不死、復改送感謝狀、不但個人感激、即後世子孫、亦莫不感激之卑言鄙語、以博一粲、中華民族人格、至比全被彼輩掃盡矣、</p>
<p>最近消息傳來、日方以通縣保安隊反正、日僑軍民、均被殺害、歸罪於殷逆汝耕、將彼逮捕、解大連審訊、聞已被槍决、爲虎作倀之結果如此、可爲殷鑒、一般漢奸聞訊、亦莫不膽寒</p>

<h3>全國應注意的重要關頭</h3>
<p>— 鞱奮</p>
<p>在兩年前我還流浪在倫敦的時候，有一天看了倫敦泰晤士報上所登日本軍部發言人的一段話，氣得一天飯都吃不下。那時日本帝國主義於掠奪東北四省之後．已開始侵人綏邊，英國各報對於日軍的橫行無忌，頗有煩言，日本軍部發言人便發表了一段意見，說中國民族無理可講，所怕的就只有拳頭•對付中國的唯一方怯就只有武力，用武力是有求必應的，用其他方法是亳無功效的，這種實際的悄形只有日本人懂得最清楚，不是西洋人所能了解的，所以奉勸西洋人不要多嘴，只要看日本人所得到的結果就可以證明的。這明明是對世界公開宣言中國人是天生的奴性，只有用對奴隸威追的辦法對付中國入！日本近衛首相毫無顧忌地對世界宜言要把中國打到屈膝，也顯示着同樣的心理，‘屈膝’是奴隸的狀態，在他看起來，中國的四萬萬五千萬人就只是一大擊具有奴性的動物而已。</p>
<p>但是被日本帝國主義視為奴隸的中國人終於不能再忍辱含垢，奮然為保持民族的生存而起來抗戰了．日本帝國主義仍深信他們可用對付奴隸方法達到成功，所以盡量利用殺人的大砲，坦克車，機關槍，毒氣，和轟炸，在中國作大規模的慘無人道的屠殺，無辜的平民和避難的婦孺，都遭受到慘無人道的屠殺•但是中國人無論遭受了怎樣的慘遇，仍然是咬緊牙根，為着爭取民族生存而忍受慘苦，毫無怨懟。世界視態，為之激轉，暴日罪惡，盡行顯露。我們已對全世界證明中國人並不是像日本帝國主羲所想像的只具有奴性的動物。</p>
<p>但是我們要眞能自㧞於‘奴籍’，最最重要的是在當前抗戰的過程中勿上日本帝國主義的老當。據路透社十月三十日由布魯塞爾傳來據說可靠來源的電訊，日本認為如果中國政府願與日本直接講和，日本願由美國出來做調人。該電訊又說日本除了駐華的某系軍閥外，都急於要停止對華戰爭，勿使範圍擴大；又說日本的領袖們都怕深入中國後易受蘇聯的襲般。這消息表示日本帝國主義經我國的英勇抗戰，已經着慌：表示在華的日軍閥已失卻國內的一般支持：表示日本帝國主義之不勝持久戰，也就是我國只要持久抗戰，必然可以得到最後的勝利。但是這一電訊說日本絕不放棄華北五省自治及內蒙帝國，甚至加上上海附近地帶的佔有。這表示日本的所謂‘講和’，就是等於要我們‘屈膝’。我們所以大聲疾呼，認‘主張妥協和平者就是漢奸’，原因也就在此。</p>
<p>我國政府為保持土地主權而領導全國抗戰，蔣委員長三令五申地表示我國必抗戰到底的决心，這是與天下以共見的事實，我們國民只有熱誠擁護政府和蔣委員長抗戰到底，决無任何懷疑的餘地。但是正是因為我們要熱誠擁護政府和蔣委員長抗戰到底，所以對於敵人動搖我國人心的陰謀及漢奸為虎作倀的活動，不得不加以精密的注意與嚴厲的制裁。</p>
<p>我們要下决心抗戰到底，做堂堂的人呢？還是自甘中涂妥協，幫助日本帝國主義造成四萬萬五千萬的‘奴隸’，使日本帝國中義代言人對世界悔辱中國民族的狂吠得到事實上的證明？這是全國應注意的重要關頭！</p>

<p>昨日由北新涇西北之侯家埭、及申紀浜口之陳家渡、偷渡至河南之敵、在砲火掩護之下、將南岸吳家厙及廳頭兩村舍佔據、作爲據點、企圖向南進犯、砲火終日不息、轟擊我方陣地、天時雖極陰黯多雲、氣壓甚低、敵機仍在一千米突以上之高度活動、我軍沉着應戰、嚴密監視、入晚、乃向前進剿、予以痛擊、我軍砲隊、集中河岸轟擊、機槍隊以廳頭及吳家厙爲目標、向前挺進、前哨步隊、匍伏蛇行、以手溜彈猛加擲擊、通宵砲戰及步兵衝鋒肉搏、昨晚午夜、廳頭之敵、已完全解决、將其逐退、紛紛落水逃生、匿於吳家厙之敵、則被我軍嚴密包圍、卽可解決、</p>
<p>今晨敵軍砲火、仍集中沿河一帶我軍陣地、大量敵機在陰霾空氣中活動、偵察投彈、我軍陣地毫無變動、</p>
<p>申紀浜以北、江橋鎭以至小南翔廣福、敵軍雖一再來犯、均巳擊退、今晨該綫較爲沈寂、</p>

<p>今日上午九時半當敵機在浦東偵炸時、浦江敵艦父頻頻發砲轟擊、在彼方海空聯合行動後、一時形勢頗告緊張、我軍全綫通令嚴加戒備、敵艦共開二十餘砲、又告沉寂、記者事後趨謁某長官、據談、浦東陣地、絕對無虞、浦江中離有敵方小汽艇載運兵士、往來於虹口楊樹浦一帶浦面、但純係遊弋巡視性質、始終未敢有積極行動、且我陣綫鞏固、警戒嚴密、敵艇决難駛近浦灘、更無從登陸一步總之、浦東全綫之平穩、一如往日云、</p>
<h3>今日午前敵機濫炸滬西浦東</h3>
<p>南市飛往偵察並未投彈　下午因大雨頻降旋絕跡</p>

<h3>法藉天主敎堂反對轟炸</h3>
<p>請政府提出抗議</p>
<p>申時社云、自敵軍當局恫嚇南市居民、講將大舉轟炸後、該處居民爭相奔避、景象至慘、連日因天雨、尚無敵機前住實施轟炸、惟頃據記者探悉、南市城廂一帶、天主敎與基督敎所置房產極多、幾佔全部房產三分之一以上、就中尤以法國籍天主敎堂所佔最鉅、故目下各該敎堂大爲憤慨、以南市於戰事上並非要衝、而日軍竟欲濫施轟炸、殘害平民及私產、作無關戰鬥上之暴行、决非國際公法之所許、故巳向本國政府請求、向日當局提出抗議、反對轟炸南市、以免危及外僑財產云、</p>
<h3>南市巡禮</h3>
<p>居民向租界逃難　商店仍照常營業　公民團維持秩序</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>比京電。據私人方面消息日本擬接受美國出任調解。以解决遠東局勢。惟須中國政府首光贊成與日本直接談判。此種消息。未免有些滑稽。因爲中日直接談刋不成。於是有不宣而戰之舉。現在戰巳八旬。仍舊直接談判。則八旬間不宣而戰之種種犧牲。直是無謂。此滑稽者。一我國抗戰。早具决心。不戰則巳。戰則决無中途罷手之理。乃當國聯開會之時。於是我國有陳述理由。請求國聯公判之舉。此固我會員國應有之表示也。國聯無法解决。乃有召開九國公約會議之主張。現在大會將開。而仍歸直接談判則召關九國公約會議之舉。實爲多事。此滑稽者二。並且日本接受美國出任調解云者。是使美國居間任調解之責任也。今旣欲我政府贊成日本直接談判則日本接受美國出任調解之說。不免滑天下之大稽。</p>

<p>— 穆深思</p>
<p>吾國金融制度、栾棧散漫、里凡都市興內地金融、不獨未進平衡發展、甚且形成陣電興偏枯之對照、平日影響國計民生、已非達鮮、況值此授戰時期、益覺戰車、故有亟謀開發內地金融必要、試要例以明之、今歲農村父告豐稔、原可捕至軍糧民食、並鞏固最大多數之國民經濟力量、本屬抗戰中之喜訊、捷因戰爭關系、致各地棉花、乏人收買、價格空前暴跃、現值新教登塲、設冉不謀補救、反將演或豐災之結果此其一、工廠邊在內地之洽商、早已引起一般人士之注意、且已進入買雙之階段、一方面努力於國防與民生工業之生產、一方面維持萬千工人之生計、實爲抗戰中之一軍要問題、然隨時隨地、需要金融機關之援助、自不持言尤以在敵人非法封鎖海岸之現狀下、正可利用此絕好機會、積稶提倡國貨、確立富強基礎、此其二、吾國內地金融祖織之未臻齊通與健全、有關於國民程濟之推展、興國家財政之設施、至重且鉅、證以目前發行之五萬萬元救國公債、就人口比例言、實非鉅數、但轉𣊬二月、勸其猶未足額、推厥消納遲綫之原因、內地無法普遍動募、洽多發內地同跑、未獲量力認請之機會、要亦不容漠視、尤有進者為抗戰持久計、不獨應使此次國債旱日募全、當更諜第二第三期國債徵募之準備、此其三、</p>
<p>當淞滬抗戰暴發之初、財部會頒佈安定金融辦法七條、一方穩定國內金融、一方防止資金外流、復由中央交農四行聯合組設內地𧵑放委員會’藉謀活商內地金融鞏固國民經濟、揆財政當局之用意、備極週詳、但因‘內地𧵑放委員會’僅分佈於少數重要都市、數量似謙不足、至安定金融辦法、因係臨時之緊急措置、顧此失彼、勢所難免、致都市資金未獲暢流內地、而內地金融、亦未能週轉活潑、鑒於上述之缺憾、雖𤁒開發內地金融之要旨四則、</p>
<p>㊀鼓勵內地優劃　凡上海匯劃存款、准其自由𦹏入內地、付以法帶、若由內地匯至上海者、則概付匯劃、但遇不實際之需要、得申述理由、呈請兀准以法帶付給之、又攜帶法帶案滬者、規定若干元以上、作爲禁律、予以沒收、藉防資金之外流、</p>

<h3>知識靑年在今日的任務</h3>
<p>‘誰為中國生力軍，唯我靑年！</p>
<p>誰為世界改造者，唯我青年！</p>
<p>精神飽滿體力健，情感熱烈意志堅，</p>
<p>奮發有為無限量，唯我青年！’</p>
<p>青年歌，採自軍歌集</p>
<p>自從‘七八’‘八一三’戰事發生後，我政府决定向日全面抗戰，於是在華南和華北，都有我們武裝靑年，發揮他們飽滿的精神，強健的體魄，熱烈的情感，堅定的意志，天天在那𧙬為國家民族爭生存，可是知識靑年怎樣呢？</p>
<p>知識靑年，多數為大中學生和小學教師，前者為數當不下六十萬，後者為數當不下五十萬這百餘萬的知識靑年，也有飽滿的精神，也有強健的體魄，也有熱烈的情感，也有堅定的意志，並且還有豐富的學識，當勝也能為國家民族發揮無限的力量。然而事實上則現在所表現的，不過募捐，慰勞，辦壁報等等極小的力量而已。</p>
<p>我不是要知織靑年，也個個武裝起來，走上前綫去，因為這一點在目前尚不須要，而且讓國家艮族的優秀分子，只發揮一個⼠兵的效力，為國家民族計、實在是一種大損失，我决不希望他們這樣去幹。</p>
<p>我們現在失去了國防綫上長城的一部份，但是忠勇的武裝靑年，已經在前綫為國造成一道血肉的長城，我們更希望知識靑年，在後方再造成一道精神上的長城。</p>
<p>甚麼是精神上的長城呢？有組織的民族和有訓練的民族，今後將為我們抗戰最偉大的力量，今後將寫我們抗戰最持久的力量，所以我們希望造成的精神上的長域，便造這有組織的民族和有訓練的民衆。</p>
<p>今日的東北人，竟有不惜為敵人作前驅者，這是我們精神上的長城沒有建筑完成的原因。</p>
<p>今日的北平，竟有中小學教員講習會的提辦，而以善隣•反黨治等為宗旨，這是我們精神的長城從沒有建筑完成的原因。</p>
<p>今日京滬路和滬杭路沿綫，常有漢奸發現，他們有的為了幾角錢的生活費，而不惜充當漢奸，甚至根本不知目已做了漢奸的，這也是我們精神上的長城沒有建筑完成原因。</p>
<p>這精神上的長域，我們是再也不能遲遲不築了，我們希望這偉大的工程，由百餘萬的知識靑年趕快承攬了去！</p>
<p>組織民眾，應讓先從知識靑年自身的組織做起，訓練民眾，應先從知識靑年自身的訓練做起。現在大中小學，在戰區內有不少停着課的，便是非戰區域以內，也有因敵機不絕轟炸而停課的,尤其是上海，由平津流亡而來的知識靑年，為數更是不少，這些失學的大中學生和失業的小學敎師，正可在當政機關或抗敵後援會等團體指導之下，自作短期必要的訓練•更五人一組，十人一組的自成簡單切實的組織。然後深入內地，更深入農村，對於廣大民衆，便可予以組織和訓練。</p>
<p>對於民眾的組織，可以利用保甲等固有的組織，不過要使他健全正击實起來。</p>
<p>對於民眾的訓練，除授以戰時京議，本國地理，國際形勢等以外，應更注重禮義廉恥，養成高尚的節操。</p>
<p>至於現在並未停課或即日就將上課的大中學生和小學敎師，也應分出一部份的時間，去做這種工作。不過可以本地為限。對於這種重大的工作，我們全國童子軍更應發揮比以館所發揮的更偉大的力量！</p>
<p>末了我願提大晚報記者的一段話，為我們全國的靑年告</p>
<p>“假使中國人，大家抱立了國存與存國亡與亡之决必，卽便他日我所生活的地帶，中國的政治勢力給敵人遮斷了，我還是照舊給國族奮斗着，不因困苦而拋棄，不因强暴而畏縮，則能騎雖踏遍了神州，中國還是整個的團結生存。我們的最後勝利，就决定在這上面。……以砲火去抵擋敵人的侵略當然重要，可是在砲火抵擋失效之後，我們惟一的長城，是團結的人心。”</p>

<h3>Stubborn Enemy Attempts River Crossing Again at Chenjiadu and Houjiadai, Fierce Fighting All Day</h3>
<p>After our army's encirclement and fierce suppression, the enemy's momentum has been greatly weakened. The enemy fiercely attacks Xiaonanxiang, seeking a foothold to no avail. Our defense line at Shixianggong Temple remains unchanged, with no westward shift.</p>
<p>From the early hours of the previous day, the enemy repeatedly attempted to cross the Suzhou River along the northern bank from the Fanhuang Railway Bridge west to Shenjibin (i.e., Yaojiadu), but was repelled by our army each time. However, at Beixinjing and Zhoujiaqiao, under the cover of their artillery and smoke screens, they managed to force their way across the river. After being encircled and fiercely attacked by our army, they were completely eliminated. Around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy again attempted to cross the river stealthily near the Zhongshan Road Bridge, with about twenty enemy soldiers even reaching the vicinity of our positions near the farmland and cotton mill. They were quickly routed by our army's repeated assaults. At 11:00 AM, the enemy again attempted to cross the river stealthily at Chenjiadu and Houjiadai, attacking our positions at Liujiazhai and Wujiaku. About a hundred enemy soldiers crossed from Chenjiadu, and after being encircled and attacked by our army, many were killed. A few remnants are still struggling. About three hundred enemy soldiers crossed at Houjiadai and were tightly surrounded by our army. As of 3:00 AM this morning (the 2nd), the fighting has intensified. The enemy is on the verge of collapse and should be completely eliminated shortly. As for the central front from Jiangqiao to Xiaonanxiang, at 2:00 PM yesterday, the enemy again concentrated their land and air forces to launch a fierce attack on our positions at Xiaonanxiang, Tangqiaojiao, and other locations. However, our positions are exceptionally well-fortified and suffered no damage. The fighting continued fiercely into the evening. On the left flank, the defense line at Shixianggong Temple has maintained close contact since our new defensive line was completed. Although the enemy has attacked several times, our line has remained unchanged and has not shifted westward.</p>
<h3>Enemy Again Crosses River to Attack Southward Yesterday</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting All Day, We Are Encircling to Resolve the Situation</p>
<p>Since the focus of the Shanghai battle shifted to western Shanghai, artillery fire has been incessant on both sides of the Suzhou River for the past three days. The enemy attempted to cross the river and attack at Zhoujiaqiao, Chenjiadu, and other places the day before yesterday, and after we inflicted heavy losses on them, they again attempted to cross stealthily at Chenjiadu and Houjiadai at 11:00 AM yesterday, resulting in fierce fighting all day. According to a report from a Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the troops at 11:30 PM last night, the enemy's momentum had been checked by evening, and our army is encircling them to resolve the situation. The battle situation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Hundred Enemy Soldiers at Chenjiadu Fiercely Attacked</h3>
<p>From early yesterday morning, the enemy army launched heavy artillery bombardment on our South bank positions. Enemy aircraft were also unusually active, but didn't drop many bombs. In the Chenjiadu area, the enemy constructed a pontoon bridge. While our army was attempting to destroy it, the enemy again released smoke screens at 11:00 AM and crossed the bridge, but numbering only about a hundred men. Our army launched an attack from Liujiazhai, killing many enemies. By nightfall, a small number of remnants retreated to the North bank, struggling, and will soon be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Three Hundred at Houjiadai Surrounded</h3>
<p>At the same time, in the Houjiadai area, about two kilometers northwest of Beixinjing, the enemy also attempted to cross the river under the cover of smoke screens and began building a bridge. The method was very simple: one end of a canvas was tied to the North bank, and a motorboat dragged it to the opposite bank and tied it down, completing the bridge. About three hundred enemy soldiers crossed there and advanced towards our Qujiaqiao and Yaojiazhai along the entire line. After our brave fighting, we pushed the enemy back westward. The enemy concentrated their forces to fiercely attack our two strongholds at Wujiaku and Tingtou, which they occupied. Our army then counterattacked and, at around 6:00 PM, drove out the enemy from Tingtou and encircled and attacked the enemy at Wujiaku, aiming to eliminate them within a limited time.</p>
<h3>Enemy Completely Eliminated the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>It has also been learned that of the three hundred enemy soldiers who crossed the river at Zhoujiaqiao the day before yesterday, only about a hundred managed to reach the South bank after being shelled by our artillery in mid-river. There are many civilian houses in that area, and the enemy scattered and hid in them, making it difficult to suppress them. Therefore, we used fire to set ablaze all the houses occupied by the enemy. The remaining twenty or thirty soldiers fled towards the riverbank and hid along the shore. Our machine-gun fire was ineffective, so we sent a suicide squad to crawl to the shore and throw hand grenades, annihilating them. Our inspection of the enemy corpses revealed that they belonged to the 6th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the Army.</p>
<p>According to another report, on the right wing, from the early hours of the previous day to dawn yesterday, the enemy launched continuous southward attacks along the line from the Fanhuang Railway Bridge west to Shenjibin (i.e., Yaojiadu) on the Suzhou River for 24 hours. Our army relied on solid defenses on the South bank, and the enemy's repeated attempts to cross the river were all repelled. However, at Beixinjing and Zhoujiaqiao, under the cover of their artillery and smoke screens, they managed to force their way across the river, but in small numbers. Last night, after being encircled and fiercely attacked by our army, they were completely eliminated. There are no enemy traces on the South bank. It is estimated that 50-60 rifles were captured at Beixinjing and 20-30 at Zhoujiaqiao. Few survived, and the rest fell into the river and died. At around 3:00 AM this morning, the enemy, unwilling to accept their complete failure at the two locations mentioned above, transferred about a company of infantry and attempted to cross the river stealthily near the Zhongshan Road Bridge. They were immediately suppressed by our army's machine-gun fire. However, a small number of enemy soldiers, about twenty, managed to reach our positions near the farmland and cotton mill. After our army's repeated assaults, they quickly collapsed due to their unstable foothold. We captured over ten rifles. After dawn, the enemy only shelled with artillery. Our army responded calmly and remained unshaken. As of noon, both sides are in a standoff across the river.</p>
<h3>Enemy Army Fiercely Attacks Xiaonanxiang</h3>
<p>Stalemate Until Evening, Our Positions Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the troops in Nanxiang reported at 12:00 AM on the 1st that the enemy's plan to attack Nanxiang westward has not been abandoned, and our army is also making thorough preparations. At 2:00 PM today, after days of preparation, the enemy indeed launched a fierce attack with over 6,000 infantry, supported by combined land and air artillery fire, attacking Xiaonanxiang head-on and advancing on our Tangqiaojiao and Tuditang flanks. The front line stretched for two kilometers. Our army's positions, which had been repaired for two days, are exceptionally well-fortified and remained intact despite the enemy's concentrated artillery fire. Therefore, the stalemate continued until evening, and our positions remained unchanged. The enemy was eager to advance and rushed forward, while we countered, leading to fierce fighting. It is expected that there will be more intense main force battles tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Our Army's Position at Shixianggong Temple Has Not Shifted Westward</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the troops in Guangfu had an interview with a senior staff officer in charge of commanding the left-wing army. He solemnly stated that his army, after several fierce battles with the enemy in Luodian from August 23rd to September 7th, only moved its positions slightly backward on September 8th and remained in a standoff with the enemy near the eastern side of Shixianggong Temple until now. Although the enemy has attacked repeatedly, our positions have not changed at all. Although the right-wing positions to the north have undergone new deployments, they have maintained close contact with the left wing at all times, so there is no impact. The previous report that the Shixianggong Temple position had shifted westward is inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Westward Attack from Zhenru Failed</h3>
<p>We Repelled the Attack, Killing Over 400 Enemy Soldiers and Capturing Three Field Guns and Fifteen Machine Guns</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the troops reported at 11:00 AM on the 1st that at 11:00 PM last night, two enemy regiments advanced westward from Zhenru along the Dianpu and Chapu Rivers, attacking our warning positions at Qianlijiaxiang and Jisian'an in front of Jiangqiao Town. We dispatched two units to counterattack, launching repeated assaults five or six times, and drove the enemy back this morning. In this battle, we killed over 400 enemy soldiers and captured three field guns and fifteen machine guns.</p>
<h3>Over Three Thousand Enemy Reinforcements Arrive</h3>
<p>Also, One Torpedo Boat and Eight Hundred Wounded Soldiers Set Sail Back to Their Country</p>
<p>At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, three enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, the "Tsuguba Maru," the "Kotoku Maru," and Transport Ship No. 198 "Ume Maru," successively sailed into Shanghai and docked at the Huangpu Wharf, the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, and the Osaka Wharf. At around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, Enemy Transport Ship No. 43 "Kuzo Maru" also arrived and docked at the Osaka Wharf. These four ships carried the sixth batch of the enemy's sixth reinforcement army, totaling over three thousand men. In addition, yesterday, three more enemy transport ships, the "Iro" Nojima and Merchant Ship converted to Transport Ship No. 135, sailed into Shanghai and docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf and the Zhabei Wharf, carrying a large amount of military supplies. Among the ships listed above, the "Ume Maru" and "Iro," left Shanghai and returned to Japan at around 4:00 PM yesterday. The remaining ships are still anchored in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a confirmed report states that there were originally two enemy torpedo boats anchored in the Huangpu River, one named "Okinosbima," anchored at the Zhabei Wharf, and one named "Iyskushima," anchored at Buoy No. 9. At around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, another enemy torpedo boat with an unknown name sailed into Shanghai and anchored at Buoy No. 8. All three ships are fully loaded with torpedoes. The purpose of their arrival is unknown. In addition, two enemy transport ships sailed into Shanghai at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning and docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf and the Zhabei Wharf, carrying countless artillery shells, rifle bullets, and other military supplies.</p>
<p>The enemy transport ship "Shanghai Maru," which carried military supplies the day before yesterday, unloaded the supplies after docking at the Huishan Wharf. Yesterday, it reloaded over eight hundred wounded enemy soldiers and set sail back to Japan at around 3:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Various Groups Visit Foreign Envoys to Request Protection of the Nine-Power Treaty</h3>
<p>Envoys Express Sympathy and Willingness to Relay Message. Telegram to Chairman of the Belgian Conference Requesting Sanctions Against Japan's Brutality. Request to European Students to Petition the Belgian Conference.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association previously convened a joint meeting of various groups and resolved many important cases, including issuing a declaration and telegrams regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, expressing its position, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has been learned that the meeting yesterday also dispatched representatives to visit foreign envoys in Shanghai, telegraphed the chairman of the conference in Belgium and the delegations of various countries, and telegraphed students studying in Europe to petition nearby. The details of the various situations are listed below:</p>
<h3>Visits to Foreign Envoys</h3>
<p>The association's delegation, consisting of Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Tong Xingbai, Liu Zhanen, Xu Xinliu, Yan Fuqing, Zhu Shaoping, and nine others, gathered at the Central Trust Bank at 9:00 AM yesterday, carrying two printed documents and a declaration, and set off to visit the consulates of various countries in Shanghai, meeting with the ambassadors and consuls representing their countries in Shanghai. On behalf of the Chinese people, they expressed their solemn position on the Nine-Power Treaty, requesting the envoys to relay the message to their respective governments and advocate for a fair position based on the spirit of the treaty. The envoys all expressed sympathy and willingness to relay the message to their governments. The atmosphere was very harmonious.</p>
<h3>Telegram to the Belgian Conference</h3>
<p>The meeting believes that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will convene in three days. Yesterday, it sent an urgent telegram to the Chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Belgium and the delegations of various countries, stating: "The Chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and the delegations of various countries of the Chinese Parliament in Beijing, it is known that since September 18th, Japanese warlords have brazenly and openly invaded our country's territory, arbitrarily damaged the integrity of our country's administration, seized our Northeast, attacked our Hebei and Chahar, looted our customs, and infringed upon our postal rights. All of the spirit and provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty have been broken without remaining. The Chinese government, in order to fulfill its treaty obligations and defend its territory, has had no choice but to fight to the death with an indomitable spirit to curb violence. Now, at the time of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the agricultural, commercial, industrial, and educational groups in Shanghai specially convened a joint meeting and jointly telegraphed your chairman and your delegations, earnestly requesting that, in order to maintain the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty, you implement: (1) clearly declare Japan as a violator of the treaty, (2) order the Japanese army to withdraw completely and quickly, (3) if Japan does not comply with the resolution, then please use the most effective sanctions to stop the Japanese atrocities, (4) actively assist China in resisting the war, and (5) in order to avoid future disputes, strengthen the Nine-Power Treaty and add sanction clauses, so that the collective security of the Pacific Ocean can be maintained and world peace can also be maintained."</p>
<h3>Telegram to Students Studying in Europe</h3>
<p>The association also telegraphed the Chinese student associations in England, France, Germany, and Belgium yesterday, stating: "The Japanese brutality is escalating, trampling on international treaties, destroying world peace, and is a scourge to humanity and a demon to the East. As long as we have breath, we will fight them to the end. Now that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is being held in Belgium, please gather nearby and petition the conference, and make sure to base your requests on the spirit of the treaty and impose effective sanctions on Japan to curb its atrocities. We are anxiously awaiting your response. The Joint Meeting of Various Groups in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Summary of Telegrams from Various Groups</h3>
<p>(1) The Chinese Labor Association, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and the Chinese Seamen's Union telegraphed the general trade unions in England, the United States, France, Russia, Norway, Brazil, Mexico, India, New Zealand, Sydney, Marseille, Canada, South Africa, Vancouver, and other places, stating: "The Japanese are launching a large-scale invasion of China, arbitrarily bombing and massacring innocent people, burning cultural institutions, and killing young students, creating an unprecedented tragedy. This not only endangers world peace but also destroys human culture. Our association and others specially telegraphed your association, earnestly requesting you to immediately implement various effective sanctions to prevent aggression and maintain peace. We would be extremely grateful."

The text of the telegram is omitted.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Rampage in Pudong</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, six enemy aircraft, divided into two teams, circled and scouted over the areas of Lujia Du, Yangjia Ji, and Zhangjia Bang in Pudong, taking turns dropping over ten bombs, destroying over ten civilian houses. The enemy aircraft only left at around 5:00 PM. At the same time, an enemy aircraft flew low over the No. 16 Wharf in the South City and the Lannidu area in Pudong, strafing with machine guns. Fortunately, the residents of the area had already taken shelter in safe areas, and there were no casualties.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Kunshan</h3>
<p>Intact Aircraft Body, Five Pilots Captured, Two Others Fled and Are Being Searched For</p>
<p>On the morning of the 30th, several enemy heavy bombers flew to Kunshan to bomb. As reported in the previous newspaper, one was shot down by our anti-aircraft guns. According to further reports, the downed enemy aircraft has an intact body. Two machine guns, one radio, and five pilots were captured. The other two fled and are currently being searched for.</p>
<h3>Commander Xie Jinyuan of the Lone Army Regiment Meets with Chinese and Foreign Reporters</h3>
<p>Discusses Withdrawal from Zhabei. Bitterly Defended for Four Days and Nights, Killing Over a Hundred Enemy Soldiers. Rich Experience in Over Ten Years of Participation in Campaigns.</p>
<p>After Xie Jinyuan, commander of the 524th Regiment of the 262nd Brigade of our 88th Division, withdrew from the last position in Zhabei under orders from the highest authorities, the regiment, excluding Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu and the wounded soldiers who have been admitted to the hospital for treatment, has arrived at a safe area and will soon return to the front line to continue killing the enemy. The Shen Shi News reporter visited Commander Xie at a certain location yesterday. At that time, Reuters reporter, French Daily reporter, and North China Daily News reporter were also visiting. The record of Commander Xie's conversation with the reporters is as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Rumors Are Absolutely Untrue</p>
<p>Foreign reporters first inquired about the Japanese propaganda stating that over a hundred Chinese soldier corpses were found in the godown after the Japanese soldiers entered the godown after the withdrawal of our lone army from the godown in Zhabei. Commander Xie replied, "The enemy's propaganda is completely untrue. In the godown, apart from a few sandbags, there were no so many corpses. There were a total of four hundred and twenty soldiers in the godown. At the time of the withdrawal, there were three hundred and seventy-seven people. Among them, more than ten were martyred, and the rest were wounded and admitted to the hospital for treatment. However, the enemy killed by our lone army was indeed more than a hundred. Because the enemy did not know how many officers and soldiers we had, they believed the Japanese rumors. The rumors are absolutely untrue."</p>
<p>Three Machine Guns Covered the Withdrawal</p>
<p>Regarding the withdrawal, Xie said that he received the order at 9:00 PM on the 30th. At that time, he immediately ordered everyone to prepare to kill the enemy but did not tell them about the withdrawal. At that time, all the officers and soldiers were determined to coexist and die with this final position. At that time, the enemy was in front, and the sound of machine guns was very close. After 1:00 AM, it slowed down slightly. The regiment took this opportunity to rush out, using three machine guns to cover the withdrawal. The enemy never dared to approach. Our safety shows how weak the enemy soldiers are. If the enemy dared to approach and attack us normally, we would not have been able to leave so safely.</p>
<p>Rest Briefly and Return to the Front Line</p>
<p>Finally, Xie said that all the officers and soldiers were extremely excited about resisting the enemy and decided to continue to the front line to kill the enemy after a brief rest. Xie is from Guangdong Province, 33 years old, and his family is currently in Guangdong. He has two sons and two daughters. Xie graduated from the fifth class of the Whampoa Military Academy and joined the Northern Expeditionary Army after graduation. He has participated in various campaigns for more than ten years and has extensive experience in combat.</p>
<h3>Brief Biographies of Three Generals Who Died in the Guangfu-Chenjiahang Area</h3>
<p>In late August, there was an unprecedented fierce battle between the enemy and us in the Guangfu and Chenjiahang areas. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Our Brigade Commander Qin Lin, Brigade Commander Pang Hanzhen, and Regimental Commander Xie Dingxin all died in action. The brief biographies of the three generals are attached below to express our condolences and commemorate them.</p>
<p>Qin Lin, courtesy name Peiran, was from Guilin, Guangxi. He graduated from the third class of the senior course of the First Branch of the Central Military Academy. He participated in various battles of the Northern Expedition. He was loyal, resolute, and brave. He died in the Wanzhai battle at the young age of thirty-six. He was a promising young soldier of modern times. When the bad news came, the entire army wept.</p>
<p>Pang Hanzhen, courtesy name Yingzhong, was from Jingxi, Guangxi. He was thirty-eight years old and graduated from the second class of the senior course of the First Branch of the Central Military Academy. During the Northern Expedition, he served as a battalion commander and other positions. He was calm, upright, brave, and promising. He also died in the Tanjiatou battle.</p>
<p>Xie Dingxin was from Rongxian, Guangxi. He served as a brigade commander and other positions in the 19th Route Army. He also participated in the January 28th Shanghai War of Resistance. He was brave and good at fighting. In the Chenjiahang battle, he led his troops in a bloody assault, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. However, Regimental Commander Xie also died in action.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings from the War Zone (II)</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>No one will forget, right? The heroic 19th Route Army in the January 28th War of Resistance fought bitterly for one month and two days, earning high praise from the world. Just as their reputation was soaring, suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, they retreated to the second line of defense. Needless to say, this was due to the enemy's stealthy landing at Liuhe.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the Shanghai War of Resistance launched on August 13th, the enemy used the most superior forces, pressing us from the sea, land, and air, and employing all means of cruelty and madness. For eighty days, they paid a heavy price before making some progress on the central front. The Liuhe garrison's defensive line was as solid as gold, causing the enemy's repeated attempts to copy the old tactics of the January 28th incident to fail. This must be said to be a great contribution of the Liuhe garrison.</p>
<p>Indeed, the merit of the Liuhe garrison's defense is very worthy of praise. Unfortunately, that place is relatively remote and difficult to access, and few people go to visit. At the same time, Mr. XXX, who is responsible for and in charge of that area, is a descendant of a military family and is also skilled in poetry and prose. He always aims for the eight characters of "seeing rights clearly and seeing life and death clearly." He is especially able to bury himself in hard work and does not seek fame. Therefore, very few systematic articles have been published about the glorious war of resistance in Liuhe.</p>
<p>Before the full-scale war of resistance broke out, the reporter visited Mr. X in a certain place and talked about national defense issues. He believed that both material and spiritual aspects are extremely important. Sometimes, material construction may be destroyed by the enemy, so we must train the people and organize the spiritual national defense of the people, making more efforts. But this is by no means something that can be achieved with a single slogan. Slogans are like prescriptions, and if they are not carefully examined by a good doctor, or if they are examined but not actually taken, they will be of no use. These words are not aimed at nothing. The fact that the current strength of the people cannot be coordinated with the military strength is precisely due to this drawback. However, the people's power, which is extremely rich in reserve, is after all the greatest cornerstone supporting a protracted war of resistance. Even if it is digging a well only when thirsty, we should also develop and use it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The enemy once landed at Shakou and was bravely repelled by our army. Both sides suffered five or six hundred casualties. In recent times, although the enemy has also attacked from time to time, our defensive positions are as solid as gold, and the soldiers' combat experience is becoming richer and more vigorous as they fight. There are even two divisions who do not want to change defenses and rest, so that the enemy is severely wounded and collapses every time they attack. In total, in the past two days, the number of enemy officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers killed has been confirmed to be more than two thousand (excluding those who jumped into the water and died). The enemy's Taiwan garrison's Shigetō detachment has been completely wiped out, with no survivors.</p>
<p>However, because of repeated failures, the enemy dared to release poison gas when attempting to land on the 11th of this month. Fortunately, the wind was very strong that night, and it did not work. Later, when cleaning the positions by the river, we found a box of poison gas bombs sent by the enemy. Apart from those that had already been released, there was only one left. The brutality of the enemy in disregarding international law is indeed a sign of their own destruction!</p>
<p>The enemy also has the crazy theory of a so-called five-year plan that can mobilize eight million people, but according to the observation of one of our military experts, even if all the able-bodied men in their country are completely driven to the battlefield, they will never be able to reach this huge number. Moreover, after this battle (in the Zhejiang-Shanghai area, in more than two months of fighting, their casualties have exceeded 60,000, and North China is likely to be even more severe), it is difficult to mobilize even one million people, no matter how hard they try. As for the number of people in our country, it will inevitably increase more and more, and at least ten million or more can be mobilized. The comparison of population and able-bodied men is also an important part of the modern assessment of military strength. We are superior to them, and the final victory will naturally belong to us!</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Forcibly Demanding Goods with Worthless Currency</h3>
<p>This newspaper, the "North China Daily News," reported that inside the pockets of dead Japanese soldiers on the Shanghai-Songhu battlefields, remarkably noteworthy paper money was frequently discovered. Some of this paper money belonged to China, some to Germany, and occasionally even to the Soviet Union in the form of rubles. None of it was currently accepted on the market. For example, among the Chinese paper money was that issued by the China Colonization Bank, which had ceased operations in 1916 during Yuan Shikai's era. Similarly, the various types of German currency were worth next to nothing after the Great War, and today are even more valueless. The intention behind this practice by the Japanese side has sparked widespread speculation. We cannot help but recall that the Japanese military spokesperson in Shanghai recently stated that Japanese troops would exchange goods for fair prices in occupied areas. Therefore, some believe that the paper money found in the pockets of dead Japanese soldiers was distributed by the Japanese authorities to enable the soldiers to obtain goods using worthless currency. This conjecture has considerable merit. However, Chinese people are well aware that this is the type of paper money previously issued by warlords in various provinces, and it will be difficult to deceive the average Chinese farmer. This action by the Japanese side is merely a clumsy and farcical stunt. What is even more ridiculous is that the five-yuan notes of the Colonization Bank carried by the Japanese soldiers bore the words "Zhejiang," when in fact, upon closer inspection, the original wording was "Harbin Three." (Translator's note: The "North China Daily News" also printed a copperplate engraving of the China Colonization Bank notes and German mark notes retrieved from the bodies of enemy soldiers.) This is not surprising, as the head office of the former Colonization Bank was originally located in Shenyang. After its currency became unacceptable on the market, it was stored in the provincial treasury. Furthermore, Chinese farmers can also recognize wartime German mark notes as worthless. According to news from North China, the Japanese troops there are also employing the same trick.</p>
<h3>Open Letter from the Taiwan Revolutionary Grand Alliance to Compatriots in Southern China and Taiwan</h3>
<p>Defend the ancestral homeland of Southern China! Defend Jinmen and Xiamen, the gateways of Southern China!</p>
<p>The Japanese imperialists' plot to invade and occupy Southern China did not begin today. They have been actively and continuously advancing their armed occupation, especially in our hometowns, the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. Since the "August 13th" incident in Shanghai, when the all-out war of resistance began, the bayonets of our national heroes on the front lines have pierced through the paper tiger of the "Imperial Army," giving the Japanese imperialists a resolute and forceful response. This has driven the savage and brutal Eastern bandits to become even more frenzied and violent, using airplanes to bomb important cities throughout China, such as Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Hainan Island, all of which have become targets for their bestial acts. Ultimately, they have even occupied these places, which is entirely in line with the malicious scheme we had foreseen. Recently, will the upcoming meeting of the signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty provide us with a favorable future for our war of resistance? Many countries have stated that the primary task of this meeting is to resolve the Sino-Japanese War. On one hand, our enemy is actively brewing the organization of a Mongolian puppet government. On the other, they are intensifying their military offensives to create numerous fait accompli as favorable conditions for mediation. Moreover, the enemy's internal collaborators, the traitors and collaborators, are also doing their utmost to lead China's great war of resistance down the path of accepting mediation. Therefore, after our troops withdrew from the Dayang defense line and strictly guarded the new positions on the 26th of this month, the Japanese imperialists immediately launched a naval offensive against Southern China. According to a special dispatch from Xiamen on the 27th, "Enemy warships fired more than a hundred shells, covering the landing of marines on Kinmen Island."</p>
<p>Furthermore, a special dispatch from Xiamen on the 28th stated, "When the enemy marines landed on Kinmen, they encountered fierce resistance from our righteous volunteers. Therefore, after occupying the island, they went into the countryside under the guidance of Taiwanese people who were previously in Jinmen, searching for military equipment and food supplies, conducting strict household registration checks, rounding up able-bodied men, and gathering them in one place for a brutal massacre using machine guns."</p>
<p>We are not surprised by these facts. We are only filled with extreme hatred for the fact that "after the Japanese pirates landed, they went into the countryside under the guidance of Taiwanese people who were previously in Jinmen." The Japanese invaders destroyed our Taiwan, and our hatred is as deep as the sea, our blood debt as high as a mountain. Now, they want to destroy the ancestral homeland of our ancestors, Southern China. We, the Taiwanese compatriots scattered throughout Southern China, can only immediately and voluntarily arm ourselves, join the united front of the motherland's resistance against Japan, charge towards the Japanese bandits, defend our homeland Southern China, defend China, and strive for national freedom and liberation. Unexpectedly, there are some insane people who shamelessly and willingly act as running dogs and internal collaborators of the enemy. Haven't decades of life as subjugated people been enough? Do they want to forever be Japanese slaves, unwilling to stand up and be free people?</p>
<p>We know that Kinmen and Xiamen are the gateways and shields of Southern China. Once they are completely occupied by the enemy, Fujian and Guangdong will face an extremely serious crisis and be threatened with subjugation. Even more frightening is that the life of slavery will be prolonged indefinitely. The tombs and fields of our ancestors will also be turned into slaughterhouses for the Japanese invaders.</p>
<p>Time is extremely pressing. We must not hesitate any longer, procrastinate, or mislead ourselves. Taiwanese compatriots residing in Southern China must immediately arm themselves, shatter the enemy's conspiracies and aggression, fight to defend our ancestral homeland Southern China, and fight to defend Kinmen and Xiamen!</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministry Issues Statement on the Eve of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>Refuting Japanese Slanders and Listing Atrocities of Aggression. No Peace Possible if Japan Does Not Withdraw Troops</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Foreign Ministry spokesman issued the following statement regarding the Japanese government's statement of October 28 refusing to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference: The Japanese government has decided to refuse to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and formally sent a reply to the Belgian ambassador to Japan on October 27 stating its so-called reasons. On the 28th, it issued a lengthy statement elaborating on its so-called position. A review of both documents reveals that they not only contain many slanderous words against China, but also fail to understand the painstaking efforts of the League of Nations and the United States to maintain peace. The Japanese statement begins by stating that the root cause of the Sino-Japanese conflict lies in China's consistent anti-foreign policy since the Xinhai Revolution, especially its thorough anti-Japanese policy. It also states that Japan has had unlimited sympathy for the awakening of China's national consciousness and has provided various forms of assistance. However, China not only did not appreciate this great virtue but instead brandished its weapons of anti-Japanism, leading to the current situation. Therefore, the key to resolving the Sino-Japanese conflict lies in China abandoning its anti-Japanese policy and instead cooperating with Japan. This argument is easily seen as false by anyone familiar with recent events in East Asia. The foreign policy of China's National Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China. This is the reasonable aspiration of the Chinese nation and is deeply understood and sympathized with by friends from other countries. The Chinese government has always respected the legitimate rights and interests of foreigners and welcomes foreign capital and technical talent. The current development of Sino-foreign commerce and the friendship between peoples are sufficient to serve as ironclad proof of China's good faith policies and cannot be obscured by Japanese slander. Japan is China's close neighbor and shares a similar culture. The Chinese government and people have no time to be anything but friendly; how could they possibly discriminate? Since the Xinhai Revolution, Japan has used every possible means to infringe upon and oppress China. The Twenty-One Demands are still fresh in the memory of the world. After the National Revolution, Japan obstructed the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, undermined China's unification, and created the Jinan Incident of 1928. Is this how they express their so-called welcome for the awakening of China's national consciousness? As for Japan's claim that it was the first to assist China in restoring tariff autonomy and expressed goodwill towards China's hope of abolishing extraterritoriality, this is also inconsistent with the facts. China signed tariff treaties with relevant countries in 1928, completing tariff autonomy. Only Japan made various demands until 1930, when it finally signed a treaty with various conditions attached. In the past two years, Japan has assisted large-scale smuggling on one hand and obstructed China's anti-smuggling efforts on the other, causing significant damage to China's tariff revenue and customs administration. Regarding the issue of extraterritoriality, Japan has made the most of this privilege in recent years to cover up various illegal activities, such as free flights, private establishment of special service agencies, provision of bandits, and sale of drugs. Is this how they "adopt policies to meet China's legitimate expectations"? After the September 18th Incident, Japan forcibly occupied Chinese territory and endangered China's survival, becoming even more blatant and unscrupulous. After the puppet state of Manchukuo, it created the puppet organization of Eastern Hebei, and now it is creating the so-called "Mongolian state" in the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan to gradually realize its conspiracy to annex China. The Chinese people have repeatedly endured such situations, which no country or nation can tolerate, in the hope of Japan's eventual awakening. The government has repeatedly instructed the people to explain the meaning of tolerance. The people can understand the government's difficulties. Even if there are occasional unfortunate incidents between the Chinese and Japanese people, the fault may not lie with China, and the Chinese government will resolve them satisfactorily in accordance with the principle of friendship. In the past three years, Japan's trade with China has increased year by year. In the first six months of this year, it almost ranked first. This proves that China has no anti-Japanese behavior. As for the evacuation of Japanese residents in various places after the Lugouqiao Incident, this was purely a planned action by Japan, intended to plan for the safety of Japanese residents and facilitate the violence of the Japanese army. When the Japanese residents were evacuated, the Chinese authorities still provided various conveniences and managed their property on their behalf, which is in stark contrast to the various difficulties imposed by Japanese authorities on Chinese residents when they left Japan. However, tolerance has its limits. As Japan's acts of oppression and aggression continue to increase, the Chinese people can no longer endure it and have to rise up to resist and exercise their natural right of self-defense. But even in the midst of the war of resistance, the Chinese people do not consider the entire Japanese people as their enemy, but rather a small number of aggressive warlords. What the Chinese people want to eliminate is not the legitimate businesses of Japanese residents in China, but rather the Japanese warlords' acts of aggression against China. In short, China has no anti-foreign behavior at all, and initially there was no anti-Japanese incident. The current unfortunate situation is entirely caused by Japan's continuous acts of aggression and oppression. The Japanese statement claims that the recent cause of the Sino-Japanese situation in North China was due to China violating the so-called "He-Umezu Agreement" and dispatching central troops to the north. In Shanghai, it was due to China disregarding the Shanghai Truce Agreement and entering the demilitarized zone. Therefore, the Japanese military actions in Hebei and Shanghai were purely self-defense measures and did not violate the Nine-Power Treaty. This tone is purely sophistry and ignores the facts. How the Lugouqiao Incident and the Shanghai Hongqiao Airport Incident occurred due to Japanese military provocations, how the Chinese government exhausted its efforts to seek a peaceful resolution, how the Japanese government lacked peaceful sincerity and concentrated a large number of naval, land, and air forces to attack the Chinese army, and how the Chinese army had no choice but to rise up and fight back, how the Japanese army brutally killed non-combatants and destroyed Chinese cultural institutions have all been repeatedly announced by the Chinese government, and many objective and truthful reports have been published in Chinese and foreign newspapers. The League of Nations General Assembly also had a fair and detailed report and resolution on October 6. Who is the aggressor and who is defending themselves? The facts are all there; how can they be covered up by clever words? Moreover, the Chinese government's free deployment of national troops within its own borders is an exercise of national sovereignty and is not subject to any restrictions. If it is said that Japan can dispatch a large army to invade Chinese territory, while China has no right to send troops for defense, then there is no such reason in the world. As for the Shanghai Truce Agreement, in recent years, the illegal entry of Japanese troops into the demilitarized zone in Shanghai has been heard and witnessed by Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai. When the Shanghai Incident broke out, the Japanese army openly used the Public Concession as a base for military operations, which is even more well-known to the world. Since the Japanese army had repeatedly violated the Truce Agreement in advance, how can China be blamed for adhering to it later? Japan is a signatory country to the Nine-Power Treaty, which clearly stipulates respect for China's sovereignty and territorial and administrative integrity. That is, Japan has an obligation to respect China's sovereignty and territorial and administrative integrity. Now, without any real reason, it has sent more than 500,000 naval, land, and air forces to invade China, occupy cities, massacre people, and trample on land, while still claiming that it is a "self-defense measure," still claiming that it has no territorial ambitions, and still thinking that it does not violate the Nine-Power Treaty. Who in the world will believe it? The Japanese statement and the reply to the Belgian ambassador to Japan repeatedly mention the Chinese Communist Party and the issue of communism, and claim that communism and anti-Japanese policies are both obstacles to peace between China and Japan. This is purely false propaganda that the world will not believe. China's national policy is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. For the past ten years, the Chinese Nationalist Party and the National Government have made the greatest efforts and sacrifices to eliminate the violence and redification policies of the Communist Party. The details of this process are well known to the world and do not need to be repeated. Recently, the Chinese Communist Party, in view of China's increasingly urgent foreign aggression and the only way to save the country and survive is to follow the Three Principles of the People, formally announced on September 22: (1) Abandoning the policy of violence; (2) Stopping the redification movement; (3) Abolishing the Soviet organization; (4) Abolishing the Red Army. Therefore, in today's China, everyone follows the Three Principles of the People, and the people of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, are fighting together to resist foreign aggression and realize the lofty ideals of the Three Principles of the People. No matter how clever the Japanese propaganda is, it is difficult to conceal the obvious facts. In short, the unfortunate situation between China and Japan is entirely due to Japan's continued aggression against China. If the Japanese government abandons its consistent policy of aggression, stops its acts of aggression, and withdraws its aggressive forces, it will not be difficult for peace to reappear in East Asia.

<h3>U.S. Representative States Respect for China's Position</h3>
<p>Ambassador Koo Says Minimum Requirement for Adjustment is Compliance with Treaty and Guarantee of Territorial Integrity. Conference Work to be Carried Out in Two Stages.</p>
<p>[Paris] Koo Vi-kyuin, chief representative of China attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, stated today that while China is willing for the Sino-Japanese War to be terminated through the mediation of various countries, Japan must respect its promises made to the Nine-Power Treaty. China is prepared to attend the conference and accept a peaceful solution in accordance with international law. In short, China is prepared to accept a mediation method based on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. What we firmly demand is the survival of the nation-state. Koo also stated that China does not want to engage in direct negotiations suggested by Japan. We are determined to remain committed to the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, we believe that all peace proposals must not be made through these two channels. China's current position is that of being invaded. Japan is not only destroying the Nine-Power Treaty and endangering China's survival, but is also trampling on the status of other signatory countries. Koo also expressed his great hope for the success of the conference, but expressed disappointment at Japan's refusal to attend, and said that Japan's arrogant attitude can be described as another proof of its contempt for the treaties it has signed. This kind of action that does not respect treaties not only harms the parties involved in China, but also has a great relationship with the security of the world. Therefore, today's Japanese problem in China is by no means an occasional problem, but a major problem for the survival of international society and culture. Today, if we want to seek peace and security, we must first restore the observance of treaty obligations. If this principle cannot be re-established, there will be no possibility of peace in the world, and there will be no hope for the continuation of culture. (One-day National Telegram)</p>
<p>Brussels. The U.S. delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference today stated that the U.S. would not endorse any plan to resolve the Sino-Japanese War unless it was fully accepted by China. Another source said that U.S. officials were very concerned about the issue of a ceasefire, but have now decided to reject any peace measures that would be detrimental to China. However, if the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can stop the Sino-Japanese War, or propose another conference to seek a complete solution to the Far East issue, there is no preconceived notion among the representatives of various countries as to whether such a conference is necessary. However, judging from their initial discussions, the UK, France, and the U.S. may support this plan, as such a conference may lay the cornerstone for guaranteeing China's freedom and ensuring the interests of European and American countries in the Far East. It is also possible that a new treaty will be signed later to replace the current Nine-Power Treaty and the Washington Naval Treaty. (31st National Telegram)</p>
<p>Brussels. Today, according to reliable sources, the move by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to mediate the Sino-Japanese War may fail due to China's request that the signatory countries to the treaty take joint action against Japan. It is reported that China's request will be based on the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing China's territorial integrity and political independence. This move will make the representatives of the UK, U.S., and France feel very thorny, as the three countries have agreed in advance that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference should first achieve a ceasefire between China and Japan, and then begin negotiations to seek a lasting peace. According to the U.S. delegation, the agenda is roughly set as follows: First, the representatives of various countries will make speeches for two days, and then ask the Chinese representative to explain the terms of the ceasefire that can be accepted, and then send another invitation to Japan to attend the conference and explain Japan's position and conditions for resolution. If Japan refuses to attend again, the various countries will separately find out the terms of the ceasefire from Japan. After the attitudes of China and Japan are clear, the various countries will use mediation methods at the conference to seek a compromise. However, judging from the current situation, the attitudes of China and Japan are very different, and reconciliation is quite difficult. (One-day National Telegram)</p>
<p>Brussels. Today, according to reliable sources from private sources, Japan intends to accept the U.S. as a mediator to resolve the Far East situation, but China's government must first agree to direct negotiations with Japan. It is reported that most of Japan, except for a few warlords, hopes to end the war before it becomes unmanageable. (31st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Has High Expectations for the United States</h3>
<p>Litvinov Leads Delegation to Brussels. Pacific Institute Advocates Economic Sanctions</p>
<p>[Moscow] After the Soviet government accepted Belgium's invitation to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it appointed Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Litvinov, Deputy Commissar Bodankin, and Minister to Belgium Rubinin as representatives. Litvinov and Bodankin left for Brussels at 10 p.m. last night. Belgian Minister to the Soviet Union Ledellier and many senior Soviet government officials were at the station to see them off. According to Soviet political figures, the Soviet delegation has high expectations for the U.S. attitude at this conference and believes that the only way to stop Japan's aggression against China is to rely on the U.S. This is because the UK is prepared to support any compromise plan that will protect its interests in China and does not intend to take any further action. In the U.S., both President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have made speeches condemning Japan's aggression and stating that the U.S. should not remain isolated for long. Soviet political figures have expressed their appreciation for this attitude and believe that although there are still many people in the U.S. who tend to be isolationist, they hope that Roosevelt and Hull will put their words into action. In addition, the Soviet delegation will definitely support the proposal that all peace-loving countries must form a united front to deal with aggressor countries at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. However, it is not yet known whether the Soviet Union will put forward specific proposals on this matter. (Central News Agency 31st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Rome] The Italian delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference left here this morning for Brussels. The delegation is headed by Count Maresti Scoti, a former member of the Lytton Commission, and includes senior officials and experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Central News Agency 1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Toronto, Canada. Carter, Director General of the Pacific Institute, said in a public speech here today that if the Nine-Power Treaty Conference cannot launch economic sanctions against Japan, the peace in the Far East may be delayed for three or four years before it can be realized. Carter quoted British economist Keynes as saying, "Economic sanctions are at least nine-tenths effective, and their success is of great value to both the present and the future." As for the Italian-Ethiopian War, which did not stop due to sanctions, Carter believes that Italy is a continental country, while Japan is an island country, which can be blockaded. However, economic sanctions are the last step and should only be implemented after diplomatic methods have completely failed. (31st National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] According to economists here today, whether Japan's industry will develop in the future depends on this war against China. This war against China is the peak of Japan's entry into the industrial era since it broke its isolationist state. If Japan does not exhaust its national economic power in this war and wins the final victory in China, its industry will inevitably make significant progress and endanger the commerce of various countries in the world. On the contrary, if Japan is defeated by China or its domestic economic power is exhausted and it enters a state of collapse, then the various countries can not worry about the competition of Japanese goods. (31st National Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The "Yorkshire Post," which is known as the mouthpiece of Foreign Secretary Eden, recently published an article commenting on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying, "The presence of U.S. Representative Davis at this conference is extremely important. Unfortunately, the atmosphere before the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is rather bleak. One is that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini decided not to send Foreign Minister Ciano to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The second is that the Italian government has recalled its ambassador to France, Cerutti. The third is that the political turmoil in Belgium is still unsettled. The fourth is that the solution to the problem of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War is further delayed. With all these, the future of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is ominous. However, the purpose of the conference is not to provide an opportunity for diplomatic talks, but to find a way to quickly end the war in China, which is well known to us. It is also not unimportant that President Roosevelt's confidant Davis is officially representing the U.S. at this conference. Foreign Secretary Eden will be traveling to Brussels in the next few days, presumably to take the opportunity to meet with Davis before the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to discuss the situation in the Far East."

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Mourning the Four British Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Today, Japanese warlords are using brutal aggression to destroy world justice and peace. The most valuable thing is the brave soldiers who defend justice and humanity. Under the chaos of aircraft and artillery bombardment by the invaders, the British garrison in Shanghai has always resolutely guarded the concession defense zone without giving the invaders the slightest convenience. Therefore, in recent days, there have been daily casualties among the British army. The martyrdom of the four soldiers on Bailinan Road is an especially shocking tragedy for the world, but it has also further promoted the spirit of justice in the world.</p>
<p>In addition to the spirit of justice, the humanitarian spirit shown by the British garrison in Shanghai is also deeply admirable to us. Here, let me excerpt a passage from a record (see this newspaper on the 28th) as an example. It describes the scene of British soldiers helping refugees at the Fanwangdu Bridge: "…They rolled up their sleeves and used their strong, hairy arms to carry one or two crying children at a time from the other side of the bridge, and supported or carried frail old women or women who were unable to walk across the bridge. They carried burdens of clothes or rice for the refugees across the bridge. They were sweating. Time after time. In the two hours I was there, they were always so sincere in helping the refugees as if they were their own family. I saw with my own eyes the refugees shedding tears of gratitude to them. I heard with my own ears the words of thanks spoken by the refugees from the bottom of their hearts. I know that although they do not understand, they are not hoping for people's thanks. For the first time, I saw true "humans."</p>
<p>We will never forget the spirit of justice and humanity of the British army in Shanghai. Therefore, the tragedy of Bailinan Road caused by the enemy's bombs on the 29th of last month cannot but move us to tears. Yesterday, when the four British soldiers were buried, dozens of Chinese organizations sent representatives to pay their respects, which was a very appropriate expression. We feel that although the bodies of these four soldiers have been buried underground, their spirit of martyrdom will always remain in the hearts of countless people around the world who uphold justice and humanity. Their death is immortal.</p>
<h3>Philippine People Condemn Japanese Aggression</h3>

<p>[Manila] The Philippine Democratic Political Guarantee Alliance yesterday passed a resolution: "Urging the Philippine people to unanimously condemn Japan's aggressive acts of slaughtering Chinese non-combatants, immediately launch a fundraising campaign to relieve the wounded and refugees, and prepare for economic boycott against Japan." It is understood that the Philippine Democratic Political Guarantee Alliance is a private Philippine independence organization, representing labor, students, civilian groups, etc. Only over a thousand members attended yesterday's meeting. The rest of the citizens were not allowed to participate for fear of disturbing order. In addition to Filipinos, one person each from China, Britain, and the United States spoke at the scene, and many people from France and Spain also participated. Yesterday's resolution also stated that the Philippines should support all international actions to stop Japan's crimes of conquering other countries. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 1st)</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Original Speech at the Central Memorial Week Meeting</h3>
<p>Describing the Experience of Being Sent Abroad and Personal Thoughts</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Party Headquarters held a Memorial Week for the Leader this morning. All working comrades attended. After paying their respects led by Committee Member Kong Xiangxi, he delivered a speech on the spot. His original words are as follows: "Comrades, Xiangxi has just returned from his mission abroad. Upon the order of the Central Government, I will attend today's Memorial Week to deliver a report. Due to time constraints, I can only describe the experience of this trip and my personal thoughts. This time, I was ordered to go to England to attend the coronation of the British King and to inspect the economic construction of Europe and the United States along the way. I visited various countries and had sincere discussions with their leaders in both the government and the opposition. The gracious hospitality of the various countries to the delegation is still unforgettable. This situation is definitely not just a personal affection for Xiangxi. It is because our country has achieved significant results in all constructions under the decision-making of the Central Government and the leadership of President Jiang over the years. Therefore, it can arouse the respect of various countries. Even the Lugou Bridge Incident has already occurred, and economic cooperation, such as issuing railway bonds in England and loans from other countries, can still proceed smoothly. And when the nationwide war of resistance broke out, it was originally planned to return to the country immediately to join the national crisis, but the international liaison affairs were not yet concluded, so it was delayed again. Fortunately, after more than a month of negotiations, the international community gradually became sympathetic to us. The League of Nations decided to convene a Nine-Power Treaty Conference and notified all member states that they should not obstruct our self-defense and resistance. Military assistance has also become more convenient. Both spiritual and material aspects have achieved considerable success. It is also because our loyal and brave soldiers are fighting bloody battles on the front lines, and the whole country is united under the guidance of the leader, showing people that we cannot be humiliated. As the saying goes, "God helps those who help themselves." Now I feel this is more credible. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference will be opened soon. The establishment of the Nine-Power Treaty originated from the Washington Conference. At that time, the European war had ended, and countries around the world were in pain during the war, knowing that Europe could temporarily be at peace, but the Pacific was still full of crises. Japan would take advantage of the opportunity of the World War to propose the Twenty-One Demands to our country and the Nishihara loans to control China, and then dominate Asia and take the lead in the world. It was a hidden danger to the future of peace in East Asia. Therefore, the Nine-Power Treaty was initiated to eliminate it in advance. Fortunately, the Meiji faction in Japan was in power at that time and had a world vision, so they were able to participate in the signing. However, the Japanese warlords still have the traditional militaristic concept, and their ambitions have not diminished. For more than ten years, they have used Pan-Asianism to instigate European and American countries in East Asian territories. The Japanese Empire has advocated declaring war on Britain. This has been seen in Japanese books and newspapers. Recently, there have been rumors of breaking off diplomatic relations with Britain. For example, in 1898, they opposed the United States' inclusion of Hawaii into its territory, and declared that the construction of the navy was to target the United States, and the army was to oppose the Soviet Union. It was not enough to show off its power in the Pacific, and it even planned to marry off Japanese soldiers to the Abyssinian prince in order to get involved in Africa. Judging from their ambitions, they actually want to encroach on the great powers and dominate the world. Since the 918 Incident, the great powers and our country have been trying to resolve the issue peacefully out of concern for peace in East Asia. However, the Japanese warlords have the desire to gain an inch. Although they have been advocating sweet words of the same text, the same species, coexistence, co-prosperity, and friendship, the fact of invading the territory and massacring the people has not stopped. Since the start of the all-out war of resistance, airplanes bombing civilians has been heard every day. Their cruelty is becoming more and more evident, and they are abandoning humanity. Based on this fact, judging from their ambitions, it is not just a matter for our country. It will inevitably affect friendly countries along the Pacific coast. It is expected that at the opening of the conference, all peace-loving and justice-upholding friendly countries will impose effective sanctions on the militaristic Japanese warlord government. As for our country, at a time when the strong enemy is showing off its violence, in order to seek the survival of the country and the nation, we have only to be determined to sacrifice to the end to resist the war. International sympathy is enough to give us encouragement. In the future, we should work harder to achieve final success. We deeply express our respect and trust for the efforts of various friendly countries to uphold justice and maintain peace. We especially hope that sensible and understanding people in Japan will urge the domestic warlords to wake up as soon as possible, so as to preserve the reputation of their country and the virtues of mankind, and avoid falling into a state of eternal doom. This is what our country hopes for them to wake up and extricate themselves from. (Central News Agency, 1st)</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Shelling Ninghai Sea to Cover Marine Landing</h3>
<p>Repelled by Our Brave Militia; Enemy Flees After Being Hit</p>

<h3>Hebei Provincial Bank Notes Stop Being Used</h3>
<p>Does Not Affect the Credit of the Legal Tender</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Recently, Hebei Provincial Bank notes have flowed into Henan and Shandong provinces in large quantities with the army and refugees. In Zhengzhou and other places, they are not easy to circulate, and there have been various incidents of forced circulation and discounted use, causing repeated disputes in the market. The Ministry of Finance has already received an order from President Chiang to telegraph to the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai on October 27, ordering that all provincial notes flowing out of the Hebei and Chahar provinces be stopped for use, and that the original issuing bank be responsible for making arrangements for consolidation and redemption. The reporter asked the relevant parties whether the suspension of the issuance of this provincial note would cause misunderstandings. It was told that: ⑴ The circulation of provincial notes should be limited to the province and should not be circulated outside the province. ⑵ The issuance of banknotes by the Hebei Provincial Bank has not been approved by the Central Government and is equivalent to privately issued notes. Its issuance reserve fund is also insufficient. It is different from the other banks' banknotes, the reserve fund of which is legally managed by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee and checked and announced on a regular basis. ⑶ The provinces of Hebei and Chahar are now in a state of chaos. The President of the Hebei Provincial Bank has transferred the head office to the person appointed by the Security Maintenance Association established by the enemy garrison due to its inability to resist the puppet order. This is because the bank's foundation has been shaken and it has been hijacked and used by the enemy. The suspension of its circulation now is a necessary measure and will not affect the credit of the legal tender. (Central News Agency, 1st)</p>

<p>Palma, Majorca Island: A Havas News Agency reporter recently inspected the construction of the Nationalist naval base on the Spanish Balearic Island of Majorca in the Mediterranean. The construction plan was originally conceived by Nationalist Commander-in-Chief General Franco during his tenure as fortress commander of the Balearic Islands. The main point is to excavate huge tunnels along the coastal rocks to serve as aircraft bases and to place artillery positions in such a way that they cannot be detected from the sea, thus making it impossible to attack them. The project is currently overseen by Vice Admiral Paul Nantai. Once completed, Majorca Island will become one of the most important naval fortresses in the Mediterranean. Currently, all warships belonging to the Nationalists are concentrated on Majorca Island. The officers of each ship have been replenished because, of the original 1,000 officers in the Spanish Navy, 550 have been executed, 375 are serving with the Nationalists, and 75 remain loyal to the Republican government. To fill the vacancies, the Nationalists have had to conscript merchant sailors into the navy. In addition, the Nationalist authorities are recruiting a large number of new soldiers from among the 350,000 residents of Majorca Island to form an army, which is commanded by General Canovas. Furthermore, General Franco's brother, Colonel Franco, is also serving as the air force commander on Majorca Island. Among the Balearic Islands, only Minorca Island is still occupied by the government forces, with a population of 50,000. The coastline is equipped with the latest coastal artillery, defended by 7,000 troops, several warships, and four squadrons of aircraft. (Central News Agency, 31st Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Plans to Recruit Volunteers</h3>
<p>At Least 500,000</p>
<p>[Washington] The US Army General Staff is currently drafting a plan advocating the establishment of a volunteer recruitment bureau so that, in the event of war, at least 500,000 volunteers can be recruited within two months to strengthen national defense forces. In other words, the bureau's mission is to rapidly increase domestic military strength before the United States implements conscription. The method involves establishing recruitment committees in military strategic locations in each state, chaired by a general officer. Each committee is under the control of the National Defense Forces General Staff. According to the general mobilization procedures drafted by the US Federal Government, in the event of war, the number of National Defense Forces personnel should increase from 375,000 to 1,500,000 within four months. The above volunteer recruitment plan is part of the general mobilization procedures. (Central News Agency, 31st Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Four British Soldiers Buried Yesterday Amidst Solemn Grandeur</h3>
<p>Representatives from All Sectors of Our Society Attended; Representatives of Japanese Butchers Denied Entry</p>
<p>On the 29th of last month, enemy forces shelled the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, but the aim was inaccurate, and several shells landed in the British garrison defense area of ​​Brittany Road in Vanham Ferry, causing three British soldiers, Howard Mellon and O'Toole, to unfortunately die on the spot. Finn and MacSharry were seriously injured, and Finn also died in the hospital. The British garrison authorities held a funeral ceremony for these four unfortunate martyrs at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. A battalion of British soldiers, led by senior military officers, participated, and military officers stationed in Shanghai from various countries also sent personnel to participate, but the representative of the Japanese butchers was refused entry. All sectors of our country deeply sympathize with these four British soldiers who sacrificed themselves for human justice, and those who went to hold the coffin included representatives from dozens of institutions and groups such as the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Banking Association, the Education Association, the Local Association, the Anti-Enemy Support Association, the Cultural Circles Salvation Association, the Special No. 2 District City Federation, the Western Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Truck Industry Association, the Youth Association, the Commercial Press, the Journalists Association, the Lawyers Association, and the Women's Association.</p>

When the procession was underway, those who stopped to pay their respects on both sides of the road were countless, and the mourning was extremely glorious. However, two enemy planes circled back and forth in the sky, and the sound of artillery fire in the western district was incessant. While we are remembering the four martyrs of this friendly country, we can't help but think of the Japanese warlords, the executioners of humanity, who are carrying out their slaughter work, which further increases our feelings of indignation.</p>

<h3>Various Aspects of the Former Capital After the Fall (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jingxin</p>
<p>Seventy-Odd Days of Observations</p>
<p>Since the night of July 7, when the sound of gunfire suddenly erupted at the Lugou Bridge, the Sino-Japanese War gradually unfolded. By July 27, the conflict in Langfang (an important railway station between Tianjin and Beijing) had escalated into resistance in the suburbs of Beijing. Late at night on July 28, the defending forces moved south, and Beijing, the ancient capital of our dynasties, fell into the hands of the enemy. 1.6 million compatriots were also reduced to a sub-human existence under the iron hooves of the enemy. Due to various difficulties after the incident, I, the reporter, was unable to flee south immediately, and was therefore able to witness various conditions in the former capital after its fall, lasting for more than seventy days. I only secretly escaped on the ninth of this month, detouring through Dalian, Qingdao, Jinan, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, and other places, arriving in Wuhan yesterday. Now I will briefly describe what I saw.</p>
<p>1. Traitors Actively Engage</p>
<p>Beijing was the political center of the north, and the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council was originally located here. On the evening of July 28, Song Zheyuan decided to leave Beijing and announced that Zhang Zizhong would act as the chairman of the council and also serve as the mayor of Beijing, responsible for handling everything. Except for one brigade of Ruan Xuanwu's 29th Army, which was renamed the Security Force and remained in Beijing to assist the police in maintaining local order, the rest were all withdrawn. At the same time, Pan Yugui was appointed as the director of the police bureau. Zhang and Pan took office simultaneously on August 1. When Mr. Pan took office, he said that the Japanese army would never enter the city (Pan had a deep relationship with the Japanese side, and was dismissed from his post as director of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Office because of this). On August 2, the Japanese side notified Zhang Zizhong, ordering Ruan's troops to disarm immediately and go to Huangsi to await orders, causing Zhang to be unable to take responsibility barehanded. On the 5th, he was forced to resign, and the area was in a state of anarchy, temporarily maintained only by the police bureau.</p>
<p>The activities of traitors were far before the Lugouqiao Incident. After the incident, the powerful faction advocated war, and the traitor faction advocated peace. As soon as the war started, the traitors began to act wildly. Leng Jiaji, former chairman of the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, and Zhou Zhaoxiang, former governor of Hunan Province, invited so-called local dignitaries and rose up in response to the times, running to the doors of the Japanese special service agencies every day, using the great rivers and mountains as gifts for their promotion and wealth. Song Zheyuan's departure from Beijing was due to them taking advantage of the opportunity, claiming that the Japanese would launch a large-scale bombing of Beijing, and asking him to leave in the name of considering the lives and property of 1.6 million people. Later, when the goal was reached, a new organization was brewing, using the local maintenance society as the first step in seizing power. Leng Zhou and others, fearing that they would be difficult to obtain Japanese permission because their qualifications were not convincing, intimidated Jiang Chaozong, a former Qing official, to come out of retirement to serve as the chairman of the association. Jiang declined once due to his old age, but in fact his fingers had long been twitching. The Maintenance Association began operating on August 10, but they announced its establishment on August 1. A large number of Japanese were hired as consultants, and famous figures from all walks of life were forcibly pulled in as members and consultants. Since the position of mayor of Beijing had been vacant for a long time after Zhang Zizhong was forced to step down, Leng Pan and others all coveted it and were running around every day. However, the Japanese believed that they were commoners in the market and could not bear the important task, so they instructed the Maintenance Association to use public opinion to publicly elect Jiang Chaozong as the mayor concurrently. The heads of all bureaus were also replaced, and the traitors of all sizes were able to enjoy the addiction of being officials. Local ruffians actually became high-ranking officials, such as Li Jisi, director of the Public Works Bureau, who was originally a staff member of a certain railway bureau. He went to the bureau to work every day, and in the afternoon he took over as the director of the bureau. The strange shapes and jokes were endless, and there were still many people who ran around every day. Goblins and monsters acted like ghosts, shamelessly serving their enemies and showing no shame. In fact, the power of all institutions was in the hands of Japanese consultants. The administration, income, expenses, and employment of all institutions, even a small amount of money, would be invalid without their signature and permission. Even under such circumstances, the hearts of the traitors to fight for power and profit were still soaring. For example, the tram company had better business income in Beijing. Jiang Chaozong, in the name of the Maintenance Association, appointed himself as the chairman of the board and all the members as directors and supervisors. After being rebuked and stopped by the Japanese, he withdrew his order himself. Their ignorance of shame can be said to have reached its peak at this point. In addition to the traitor group's Maintenance Association, another group of traitors, such as Xu Lanzhou, established the so-called "North China People's Self-Government Association" on August 27, competing with the Maintenance Association for the priority of selling out the country. More recently, another group of traitors has organized the Greater East Asia Alliance, which is also an agency for competing for power and profit, brewing to establish a puppet government in North China and placing the people in a place of no return.</p>
<p>The traitors flattered the Japanese in different ways, racking their brains. For example, because Beijing did not suffer war damage during the incident, a group of traitors attributed it to the Japanese army. They called themselves representatives in the name of protecting life and property, and requested to see the head of the Japanese special service agency, Matsui, and made a statement in person, requesting that a bronze statue be built for him in front of Tiananmen Square. Matsui, fearing the rumors of his country, immediately refused. They must not give up, and changed to sending a letter of thanks, with humble words and vulgar words that not only they are grateful, but also their descendants will be grateful, in order to win a smile. The personality of the Chinese nation has been completely swept away by them.</p>
<p>Recent news has come that the Japanese blamed Yin Rugeng for the uprising of the Tongxian Security Force, the killing of Japanese expatriates, and arrested him for interrogation in Dalian. It is reported that he has been shot. The result of serving as an accomplice to the tiger is like this, which can serve as a warning. When the general traitors heard the news, they were also terrified.</p>
<h3>General Labor Union Raises Funds to Comfort Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Currently Casting Commemorative Medals for the Songhu Resistance</p>
<p>In order to comfort the heroic soldiers who have been wounded, the General Labor Union of this city has raised funds to prepare resistance commemorative medals to be distributed to the soldiers as permanent souvenirs. The titles of each donor are listed below: Zhan Xinxian 50 yuan, Zhou Dexin 30 yuan, Cheng Zhenlai 10 yuan, Dai Songlai 10 yuan, Chen Caibao 20 yuan, He Shudao 20 yuan, Xu Zhixiang and Guo Shangjin 20 yuan each, Li Yaoting 20 yuan, Li Fenglai 20 yuan, Li Yougeng 10 yuan, Zhang Jing'an 20 yuan, Yang Guanzhao 50 yuan, Lou Yinchuan 50 yuan, Zhang Shulin 20 yuan, Qi Lianzhang 20 yuan, Yu Rupin 50 yuan, Shao Xubai 20 yuan, Zhou Xuexiang 30 yuan, Zhu Xuefan 30 yuan, Long Peiyun 20 yuan, totaling 540 yuan. It is reported that the badges are bronze in color, engraved with the words "Songhu Resistance Commemorative," and a steel helmet is drawn in the middle, engraved with the words "National Hero," tied with a red ribbon, which is quite exquisite and lovely. The union will send personnel to various wounded soldiers' hospitals to distribute them separately in the near future.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Wang Works Hard to Raise National Bonds</h3>
<p>Facilitating Deposits and Bond Purchases; Suggesting Rent-for-Bonds Method</p>
<p>The Women's Group for Fundraising for National Salvation Bonds received a telegram yesterday from Ambassador Wang stationed in the United States to Madame Kong, the director of the group, stating that they will follow up on mobilizing the forces of the overseas Chinese women's community and will report the results in the near future.</p>
<p>Deposit Booklets Can Be Used to Purchase Bonds</p>
<p>The General Assembly of the National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Committee stated that, according to people's applications, they will use deposit booklets to purchase national bonds. They have contacted various banks separately, and all banks can provide support and facilitate payment. It has now been learned that Jin Cheng Bank has replied to the General Assembly, agreeing to facilitate the handling of 28 deposit booklets, totaling more than 7,000 yuan, from depositors Xiang Meiying and others in the bank. The Shanghai Industrial Trust Company has also agreed to facilitate the payment of 10,000 yuan in deposits from depositor Fang Zhemin, and the China National Goods Bank has also agreed to facilitate the payment of 110 yuan in deposits from depositor Weng Muzong.</p>
<p>Suggestions from the Special Zone Citizens' Association</p>
<p>The Eighth District Branch of the Citizens' United Association of the Special Area in this port specially suggested to the National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Committee on the implementation of methods for purchasing national salvation bonds with rent: ⑴ Notify all landlords in the city to use one month's rent as the standard to subscribe to national bonds in full; ⑵ Tenants can subscribe on behalf of the landlords and pay to the designated bank. In exchange for rent tickets for any month when collecting rent, ⑶ The period is until the end of November, and the bank should be paid on time. If it is found that a neighborhood or household has not yet purchased bonds on behalf of them within the time limit, they will be ordered to pay. The bond raising will continue until the bonds are fully raised. ⑷ The investigation work will be undertaken by the citizens' branch associations in the two special districts. ⑸ Owners should notify tenants separately to implement this. ⑹ For Chinese industries managed by foreign merchants, they should also be handled in the same way.</p>

The audience was moved by everything. Finally, four children, Hu Xiangqin, Hu Juqiu, Li Mingmin, and Zhang Weiwei, on behalf of all the people, presented flags and flowers to the military commander to show their comfort and respect.</p>
<h3>Not Ashamed of Being the Daughter of a Military Family, a Girl Donates Money to Comfort the Troops</h3>
<p>Since the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our soldiers on the front line have been bravely fighting the enemy and sacrificing their lives on the battlefield. The people in the rear are enthusiastically contributing and donating money to comfort these heroes who are seeking the survival of the country and the nation, fulfilling the natural duties of the people and expressing their determination to resist the enemy. Yesterday, this newspaper received two national dollars from five-year-old Liu Nongsun, which was the money she saved from her daily candy allowance to comfort the soldiers on the front line, and she personally wrote, "These two dollars are for my father's comrades." Her father, Liu Yun Jia, is also one of the members in the War of Resistance Against Japan. ××</p>
<h3>Both Guangdong and Guangxi Students in Shanghai Sent a Telegram to Chairman Chiang and Others to Pay Respects</h3>
<p>Protecting the Country and Defending the Territory is Admired by All; Please Implement the Policy Thoroughly to Comfort the Hopes of the People</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Guangdong and Guangxi Students' Anti-Enemy Support Association in Shanghai has been engaged in education and national salvation work, which is extremely tense. Considering that the start of the national resistance depends on the leadership of the government, which has dealt a heavy blow to the violent enemy, Tan Qixiang, chairman of the association, and all members jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang and Wu, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, General Commander Yu, Commander-in-Chief Li of the Nanjing Military Commission, and Deputy Commander Bai, to express their condolences and pledge to be the backing force. It is learned that the original text of the condolence telegram is as follows ⑴ The telegram to Chairman Chiang in Nanjing said, "Chairman Chiang, Japan is invading. We rely on your prestige to lead the army, defend the country, and your achievements are as high as Mount Hua, admired by the world.

<h3>Urgent Order for Registration of Jointly Published Publications</h3>
<p>Various Suspended Publications Must Also Be Reported and Investigated According to Law</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Resistance War, many of the publications originally registered in this city have been temporarily suspended due to the impact of the war, or have been jointly published by several publishing houses. The question of whether these publications should be subject to re-registration or change of registration has been submitted by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to the Municipal Government for instructions. The bureau has received Instruction No. 2144 from the Municipal Government, which states, "The matter is noted. Publications jointly published by various publishing houses should be regarded as new publications and must be registered in accordance with Article 9 of the Publications Law. If publishing houses themselves have temporarily suspended publication due to the impact of the war, they should also report to the local competent authorities for forwarding to the Ministry of the Interior in accordance with Article 24 of the Implementing Regulations of the Publications Law. It is imperative that you separately forward this order for compliance." Yesterday, Special Order No. 2415 was issued, ordering that all publishing houses in this city that have temporarily suspended publication due to the impact of the war must submit a report on the suspension to the bureau for forwarding before November 10th. Those who jointly publish publications with several publishing houses must also apply for registration in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3>Nanshi Remains Peaceful as Before</h3>
<p>Shops Open as Usual, Police Maintain Order; French Authorities Send Troops to Protect the Waterworks Director</p>
<p>Yesterday, our reporter made a special trip to Nanshi to investigate and found that the situation there was still very stable. Most of the shops on Zhaojiabang Road, Fangbang Road, Xiaodongmen, and other major streets were still open for business. The police and trained citizens maintained order as usual, with a calm and composed attitude. However, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifice, many citizens withdrew. Therefore, around 8 a.m., vehicles moving belongings filled the roads around Xiaoximen and Laobeimen. By 10 a.m., the traffic there was even more congested, and the transportation lines were almost cut off. Fortunately, the police directed traffic effectively, and order was maintained well.</p>
<p>Around 10 a.m. yesterday, an enemy plane flew over Nanshi to reconnoiter, then left without dropping any bombs.</p>
<p>The French Concession's waterworks director is located on the Bund outside the Bansongyuan Road in Nanshi. Therefore, yesterday morning, the French military authorities dispatched many French soldiers to protect it closely by vehicle. A French warship has been stationed for a long time at the Qiuxin Factory outside Puzhong. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the water supply.</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that residents of Nanshi have heard rumors that the Japanese army will bomb Nanshi and are now moving into the French and International Concessions. According to Chinese newspapers, the Japanese military authorities notified the consulates of various countries in Shanghai that the Japanese army would bomb Nanshi, so they asked foreigners to evacuate the area. However, according to the French authorities, foreign consulates have not received such notification.</p>
<h3>Czech Minister Pays Courtesy Visit to Mayor Yu</h3>
<p>Czech Minister Mr. Cipa has been in China for more than two months and is stationed in the capital. He came to Shanghai on official business the other day. Yesterday (the 1st), at 10 a.m., he made a special trip to the Municipal Government on Fenglin Bridge to pay a courtesy visit to Mayor Yu, exchanging pleasantries for a while before taking his leave.</p>

<h3>Designated Donations for Yang's Battalion Being Distributed</h3>
<p>When the Shanghai Municipal Comfort Committee learned that the Yang Battalion's isolated troops of the 88th Division were holding out at the Sihang Warehouse, various parties entrusted them with cash to purchase goods for comfort, such as 200 yuan (National Currency) donated by the China Electrical Workers' Union, 100 yuan donated by the employees of the Fufeng Factory, 40 yuan donated by Guan Yunnong, 40 yuan donated by Zhang Shujun, and other donations, amounting to a considerable sum. Now that the Yang Battalion has safely withdrawn, the committee is distributing the funds for use, hoping not to disappoint the donors. In addition, the committee purchased a large number of blankets, mast lights, and other practical items from the comfort funds the other day and sent staff to deliver them directly to the Yang Battalion. Now that the Yang Battalion has gone to the front line to fight again, please stop sending food and other comfort items to the Yang Battalion from now on, so as not to waste material resources.</p>
<h3>Money Shops Extend Ten-Batch Procedures</h3>
<p>The maximum extension period is six months, and all interest for the previous period must be paid in full.</p>
<p>After the Shanghai money shops made accommodations to extend the ten-batch, ten-installment credit loans, since October 31st was a Sunday holiday, all extension procedures were carried out yesterday. The shops were very busy because of this. The extension period ranged from one month to six months, but all interest for the previous period had to be paid in full. Because old loans could not be recovered, new loans were temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>The Scene in Songjiang After the Enemy Bombing</h3>
<p>After the enemy planes indiscriminately bombed Songjiang on the 28th and 29th, the city was deserted, and the residents fled. When the Songhui Inn area at the foot of the West City Wall caught fire, only Yao Chongfu, Zhang Mengxing, and a few others from the Fire Brigade dragged the hoses to put out the fire. Fortunately, the investigators from the People's Committee and Yang Shijie and others assisted in demolishing houses to rescue and maintain traffic, and the Jinghua Market Street in the west of the suspension bridge was spared from spreading fire. Otherwise, the losses would have been even greater. Five bombed corpses under the West City were buried by the Red Cross on the evening of the 30th.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan's Speech Encourages Boy Scouts</h3>
<p>Long-term service, review character, and determine future work guidelines</p>
<p>The First Regiment (i.e., Shanghai City) of the Wartime Service Corps of the Boy Scouts of China held its fifth anniversary week at the headquarters of the General Corps on Tianjin Road at 9 a.m. yesterday. Mr. Pan Gongzhan attended the speech and held a group affairs meeting to discuss many important items. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Pan's Speech: The fifth anniversary week was held at the headquarters of the group yesterday. More than 400 people, including Leng Xueqiao and other officials at all levels, as well as representatives of the sub-groups and directly subordinate large and small teams, attended. Pan Gongzhan gave a speech saying that today is the fifth anniversary week of the First Regiment of the Wartime Service Corps of the Boy Scouts of China, and I feel very excited. Since the Boy Scouts started various tasks on August 13, they have won praise from people from all walks of life and praise from all countries in the world. However, our responsibilities are becoming more and more important. I hope to work hard to serve with the goal of doing one good deed a day. Finally, he said that the withdrawal of our army from Zhabei and Jiangwan is entirely due to strategic relations. I hope that you will continue the spirit of the past and lead the Boy Scouts to serve for a long time and review your own character.</p>
<p>Group Affairs Meeting: The group convened a group affairs meeting last week to discuss the "Proposal to Determine the Future Service Guidelines of This Group." It was decided that: 1. Resist the war to the end and serve to the end; 2. Strengthen the organization and intensify work; 3. Follow the army's movements and pay attention to liaison. "Proposal to Determine the Future Work Steps of This Group" It was decided that: 1. The Boy Scouts who are currently working will continue to hold their original positions; 2. Boy Scouts who do not have jobs in the group will find ways to send them out to serve; 3. The maximum number of people sent out for the first mountain launch is 50 per place; 4. Designated locations for stationing: (A) Suzhou, (B) Songjiang, (C) Kunshan, and (D) Jiaxing. It is also learned that the group has sent staff to take charge of everything for the Boy Scouts stationed in Suzhou and Kunshan. In addition, the group is now recruiting reserve members, who must have proof from the headquarters or a letter of recommendation from the school, and fill out a parental permission form, a volunteer form, and a photo. Those whose procedures are incomplete or who fail the exam will not be admitted. They have won praise from various divisions and brigades on the front line and people from all walks of life. Since our army retreated to the new front line, the team still goes to ×× every day to rescue wounded soldiers, and the rescue work covers the entire war zone. However, because the war zone has moved backward and the road is longer, I deeply feel that the round trip takes a long time, and the prepared ambulances are not enough. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will consider the soldiers who are fighting bravely against the enemy on the front line. If there are trucks and military vehicles, please donate or lend them generously, so that the team can rescue as widely as possible.</p>
<h3>Inquiry about the Exchange of National Salvation Donation Receipts</h3>
<p>Those with official receipts do not need to exchange them again.</p>
<p>The National Salvation Donation Fundraising Committee of this city entrusted Xu Yongzuo Accounting Firm yesterday to exchange official National Salvation Donation receipts so that they can be used to exchange for National Salvation Public Bonds in the future. Our reporter inquired about the details from Xu Yongzuo Accounting Firm yesterday. According to reports, those donors who have received official receipts (with the name of the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association Fundraising Committee from All Walks of Life and the name of its director printed on the receipt, and the seal of the acting agency) do not need to exchange them again. It is a pity that most donors misunderstand this and come to exchange official receipts, which is a lot of trouble. There are also those who come to exchange receipts for donations from their own institutions and radio stations, which is also a misunderstanding. The acting agencies entrusted by the Fundraising Committee are only banks, money shops, and newspapers, and no other institutions.</p>
<h3>Measures for Treating Seriously Ill Refugees at Night</h3>
<p>Doctors on duty from the First and Second Relief Hospitals will go to treat them.</p>
<p>The Health Group of the Shanghai Branch of the Emergency Period Refugee Relief Committee, in view of the fact that the sick refugees in various shelters have either exceeded the consultation time or suddenly develop serious illnesses at night, which is especially pitiful, has specially stipulated the following treatment methods: 1. For each shelter that has not been assigned a doctor, or if there is a doctor but the consultation time has passed, if a refugee living in the shelter suffers from a minor internal or surgical illness, the administrator of the shelter can prepare a note and send the refugee directly to the outpatient department of the relief hospital for consultation and treatment. (The first hospital is located at the original site of the Hangzhou Restaurant on Aiduya Road, and the second hospital is located at the Labor Hospital at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Binshu Road.) 2. For refugees suffering from serious internal or surgical illnesses who cannot move, the administrators of the shelters can call 32327 during the day to contact the group, and at night can call the relief hospital, the first hospital at 96564, or the second hospital at 35457, to ask the resident on-duty doctor to go to the shelter for treatment. 3. Patients going to the relief hospital for outpatient treatment by car can have their transportation expenses reimbursed by the shelters, indicating the date, patient's name, illness, route, and transportation costs, and verifying the reimbursement, but in principle, electric trams, buses, or rickshaws should be used.</p>

<h3>The Important Crossroads That the Whole Country Should Pay Attention To</h3>
<p>— Tao Fen</p>
<p>Two years ago, when I was still wandering in London, I read a statement by a spokesperson for the Japanese military headquarters in the London Times one day, and I was so angry that I couldn't eat for a day. At that time, Japanese imperialism, after plundering the four northeastern provinces, had begun to invade the border of Suiyuan. The British newspapers had many complaints about the Japanese army's recklessness, and the spokesperson for the Japanese military headquarters published a statement saying that the Chinese nation was unreasonable and only feared fists. The only way to deal with China was with force. Using force was always effective, and other methods were ineffective. Only the Japanese knew this practical situation best, and Westerners could not understand it. Therefore, he advised Westerners not to interfere, and only look at the results obtained by the Japanese to prove it. This was clearly a public declaration to the world that the Chinese were born with a servile nature, and the only way to deal with China was to use methods to coerce slaves! Japanese Prime Minister Konoe made a public statement to the world without any scruples that he would beat China to its knees, which also showed the same mentality. 'Kneeling' is the state of a slave. In his view, China's 450 million people are just a large group of animals with a servile nature.</p>
<p>But the Chinese, who were regarded as slaves by Japanese imperialism, could no longer endure humiliation and rose up to resist the war in order to maintain the survival of the nation. Japanese imperialism still firmly believed that they could succeed by using methods to deal with slaves, so they made full use of murderous cannons, tanks, machine guns, poison gas, and bombing to carry out large-scale, inhumane massacres in China. Innocent civilians and refugees were subjected to inhumane massacres. But no matter what kind of tragedy the Chinese suffered, they still gritted their teeth and endured the suffering without complaint in order to strive for national survival. The world's attitude was drastically changed, and the crimes of the violent Japanese were fully revealed. We have proved to the world that the Chinese are not animals with only a servile nature, as Japanese imperialism imagined.</p>
<p>But if we want to truly free ourselves from 'slavery', the most important thing is not to fall for the old tricks of Japanese imperialism in the current war of resistance. According to a Reuters dispatch from Brussels on October 30, from a supposedly reliable source, Japan believes that if the Chinese government is willing to negotiate directly with Japan, Japan is willing to have the United States come out to mediate. The dispatch also said that except for a certain clique of warlords stationed in China, all of Japan is eager to stop the war against China and prevent its scope from expanding; and that Japanese leaders are afraid of being easily attacked by the Soviet Union after going deep into China. This news shows that Japanese imperialism has been panicked by our country's heroic resistance; it shows that the Japanese warlords in China have lost the general support of the country; it shows that Japanese imperialism cannot win a protracted war, which means that as long as our country perseveres in the war of resistance, we will surely achieve final victory. But the dispatch said that Japan will never give up the autonomy of the five provinces of North China and the empire of Inner Mongolia, and even add the possession of the area near Shanghai. This means that Japan's so-called 'peace' is equivalent to asking us to 'kneel'. This is why we loudly call out that 'those who advocate compromise and peace are traitors'.</p>
<p>Our government is leading the country in the war of resistance in order to maintain territorial sovereignty. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated his determination to resist the war to the end, which is a fact that the world can see. Our people only need to wholeheartedly support the government and Chairman Chiang in resisting the war to the end, and there is no room for doubt. But precisely because we want to wholeheartedly support the government and Chairman Chiang in resisting the war to the end, we must pay close attention to and severely punish the enemy's conspiracy to shake the morale of our people and the activities of traitors who act as accomplices.</p>
<p>Are we determined to resist the war to the end and be honorable people? Or are we willing to compromise halfway, help Japanese imperialism create 450 million 'slaves', and allow the Japanese imperialist spokesmen's rabid barking at the world to humiliate the Chinese nation to be proven in fact? This is an important crossroads that the whole country should pay attention to!</p>
<h3>British Scout Leader Expresses Sympathy and Wishes Victory</h3>
<p>A letter was sent to the Municipal Boy Scout Service Corps yesterday. The letter took a month to arrive.</p>
<p>Mr. Bading, chairman of the British Boy Scout Association in London, sent a letter of condolence to the Boy Scouts serving in Shanghai in wartime on the first day of last month. It was received yesterday. It took exactly one month via Siberia. The original letter briefly stated, "I have learned of your letter of August 20. The British Boy Scout brothers deeply care for and admire your spirit of serving wounded compatriots and refugees. The day when your country will achieve victory and peace must not be far away. I hereby express my sincere sympathy and congratulations."</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Relieves Middle and Higher Education Students in War Zones</h3>
<p>Appropriate subsidies are provided to schools that have moved south.</p>
<p>Nanjing dispatch: Students from middle and higher education institutions in the war zones of Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Pingjin, and other provinces and cities who came to Nanjing one after another have long been received and registered by the Ministry of Education and ordered to attend school, receive training, and evacuate in all directions. Approximately 900 people were issued train and boat tickets and sent to various places to study, and approximately 600 people were transferred to relevant agencies for training. Several funds were also remitted to subsidize the Shandong and Shaanxi Education Departments to handle relief matters. Recently, it was found that there are still many teachers and students from middle schools in the provinces and cities mentioned above who have arrived in Henan and Shaanxi. It is known that some schools in southern Hebei have safely transported important equipment and documents such as books and instruments to Henan. The Ministry of Education has formulated measures and allocated funds to set up one or two temporary middle schools and normal schools in Henan to accommodate the various students. In addition to sending Commissioner Cha Liangzhao to Henan to coordinate preparations, the Ministry has also telegraphed the Henan Education Department to arrange for the reception of the teachers and students first. Recently, when Yao Yinshun, Zhang Chenqing, Yang Yuru, and other principals of normal schools in Hebei reported to the Ministry, the Ministry immediately ordered them to return to Henan to participate in the work. It is also heard that the Ministry will send another commissioner to supervise the progress.</p>
<h3>The Truth About Qin Guoding's Beating to Death</h3>
<p>Short Stature Led to Misidentification; Proof Documents Were Lost in Transit</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association from All Walks of Life spoke to our reporter. The association recently received a letter from the Public Works Bureau instructing it to correct the situation of Qin Guoding, a technician from the Construction Committee of the Central District of the city, being beaten to death by passers-by. The original letter briefly stated that Qin Guoding, a technician from the architect's office of the Central District Construction Committee of the city, was from Liaoning and Qingdao. He once studied architecture in Germany and returned to China. After the Northeast was occupied, he was unwilling to return to his hometown and become a compliant citizen of the occupied country. He worked in the Shanghai Central Construction Committee and contributed a lot to the construction work. Because he was deeply stimulated, he always harbored an irreconcilable hatred for the enemy. He was truly a rare and promising young man. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 29th of last month, Qin and his friend Duan were walking through the intersection of Xinzha Road and Wenzhou Road when a large crowd was gathering to watch the brave and heroic isolated army fighting in the Sihang Warehouse. Suddenly, one or two citizens mistakenly identified Qin and others as Japanese because of their short stature. Both men immediately showed their proof documents, hoping to dispel the crowd's doubts. However, because the certificate was held in hand, they were fortunately spared from being beaten. However, Qin's employee certificate, which had Qin's photo on it, was passed around for viewing and was then lost. Later, people did not ask about the situation and immediately beat him in droves. One voice led to a hundred responses, and the police were unable to stop it. In an instant, he died under the crisscrossing sticks. The situation was extremely tragic. Government authorities were extremely saddened after hearing the news. This kind of tragedy has been seen many times since the war of resistance. It is hoped that patriotic citizens will be more careful in the future to avoid similar unfortunate incidents. If you encounter someone who looks suspicious, you can ask the police to arrest and hand them over for legal action. Otherwise, Qin's death is a major loss to both the public and private sectors.</p>
<h3>Mitten Fundraising Campaign</h3>
<p>Initiated by the Municipal Joint Comfort Committee, fundraising is underway.</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of Shanghai Comfort Committee for Anti-Enemy Soldiers, in view of the approaching early winter and the increasingly cold weather, and the concern of all circles in this city for the hardship of the soldiers, has collected a large number of cotton vests and sent them to the front line. However, in the future, soldiers fighting bitterly with the enemy in the bleak north wind will also need mittens very much. The committee plans to launch a mitten fundraising campaign. It is currently discussing the measures and will soon launch a general fundraising campaign among member stores, residents, citizens, and people from all walks of life in the district to meet the needs of soldiers on the front line. Other military comfort items are also being collected at the same time. The committee's office is now located at 77 Racecourse Road, telephone number 96658.</p>
<h3>Monastic Rescue Team Lacks Ambulances</h3>
<p>Hoping for Donations or Loans from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>The Monastic Rescue Team, organized by the Shanghai Charity Organization United Disaster Relief Association's Committee for Rescuing Refugees in War Zones, has been dispatched to the front line every day to rescue the wounded under the leadership of General Captain Qu Wenliu and Deputy General Captain Hongming Dharma Master since its establishment. Under intense gunfire, the team still does not avoid hardship and ventures to the front line to rescue our loyal and brave wounded soldiers. Its brave service spirit has won the praise of various divisions and brigades on the front line and people from all walks of life. Since our army retreated to the new front line, the team still goes to ×× every day to rescue wounded soldiers, and the rescue work covers the entire war zone. However, because the war zone has moved backward and the road is longer, I deeply feel that the round trip takes a long time, and the prepared ambulances are not enough. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will consider the soldiers who are fighting bravely against the enemy on the front line. If there are trucks and cars, please donate or lend them generously, so that the team can rescue as widely as possible.</p>
<h3>Division Commander Zhu's Injuries Have Not Yet Left Danger</h3>
<p>One Blood Vessel in the Chest Has Already Ruptured; The Right Nervous System Has Also Been Damaged</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Division Commander Zhu Yaohua of a certain division, because of the loss of Dachang, which affected the overall situation of the Shanghai war, had no face to face his superiors and comrades, so he shot himself on the afternoon of the 28th of last month. He was immediately sent to a certain hospital in Shanghai for treatment. The Central News Agency reporter made a special trip to visit him yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Enduring the Pain of Abandoning After Being Breached by the Enemy</p>
<p>Before coming to Shanghai, Division Commander Zhu had led the unit in Jiangxi to carry out bandit suppression work, and he had repeatedly established meritorious achievements and won the praise of his superiors. This time, he was ordered to come to Shanghai to take charge of the defense line west of Dachang, and he repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the invading enemy army. Since the enemy adopted the strategy of breaking through the center, the division became the main force in the frontal battle, resisting desperately and holding on to the original position. On the 25th of last month, the enemy attacked again with a large force, and the division still resisted desperately, but in the end, because the equipment was too poor, it was breached by the enemy army, which led to the impact on the overall situation in Shanghai. He had no choice but to endure the pain and abandon even Jiangwan and Zhabei.</p>
<p>Shooting Himself and Being Sent to the Hospital for Treatment</p>
<p>Division Commander Zhu, because the important place was lost and he had no face to face his superiors and comrades, shot himself with a pistol on the afternoon of the 18th. The bullet passed through the third and fourth ribs above the right breast, through the tip of the lung, to the back, but did not penetrate. He immediately fell to the ground. He was then helped up and it was found that there was still weak breathing in the chest. He was immediately sent to a certain hospital in Shanghai for surgery to remove the bullet. The procedure was still good, but because Division Commander Zhu was both tall and fat, there were still bone fragments embedded in the muscles, which were not easy to remove. Therefore, the wound has not healed yet. In order to prevent inflammation and lung bleeding, he is currently being injected and nursed.</p>
<p>Examination Shows That He Has Not Yet Left Danger</p>
<p>When the reporter visited Division Commander Zhu at a certain hospital yesterday, he saw that his physique was very healthy, but his spirit was quite depressed. Ge Zhiqiang, the military doctor of the division, was by his side to take care of him. According to the doctor, one blood vessel in Division Commander Zhu's chest has already ruptured. Today (the 1st), an X-ray examination was used, but the location of the rupture has not yet been found. The right nervous system has also been damaged, resulting in the complete failure of the left arm and no feeling. The examination will continue tomorrow (i.e., today). Therefore, he has not yet left the danger zone. For the sake of recuperation, he will refuse to see all guests in the future. The reporter also thought that Division Commander Zhu's life was in danger and it was not convenient to talk too much, so he said goodbye and left.</p>
<h3>Urgently Awaiting Donations of Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>Cotton quilts, cotton, and first aid kits are also hoped to be generously donated.</p>
<p>As the weather is getting colder, many soldiers are in great need of cotton vests. The cotton vests donated by various parties that have been received by the Shanghai Municipal Comfort Committee have been claimed by various armies and are about to run out. We have no choice but to hope that all parties will continue to donate. Cotton quilts and cotton are also in great need. We also hope that first aid kits will be generously donated.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting on Both Banks of the Suzhou River: Surrounded and Suppressed Stubborn Enemies Trying to Cross Over</h3>
<p>The remaining enemies at Wujia Shed are expected to be cleared out after our joint attack. No trace of the enemy remains in the Yaojia Zhai and Liujia Zhai areas. Over sixty enemy aircraft bombarded our positions along the river.</p>
<p>The focus of the Shanghai battle has shifted to both banks of the Suzhou River. The enemy is desperately trying to achieve a quick victory and has concentrated its forces for days, attempting to cross the Suzhou River in multiple routes. Aircraft and artillery bombard our riverside positions day and night. Our troops are responding calmly, still using the strategy of encirclement to annihilate the stubborn enemies trying to cross over. At dawn this morning, over sixty enemy aircraft were active along the Suzhou River west of Shanghai, dropping countless bombs. The roaring sounds shook the entire city. The sounds of artillery and machine guns were also clearly audible. The battle situation is extremely fierce. The frontline report obtained by this newspaper this afternoon is as follows: ㊀ The enemies who crossed the river near Zhongshan Road Bridge have already been completely cleared out. The enemy and we are still facing each other across the river, with fierce artillery battles on both sides. ㊁ The enemy crossed over from Chenjia Du, Jiangjia Zhai, Jinjia Zhai, etc., and fiercely attacked our Liujia Zhai position (Liujia Zhai is located between Beixin Jing and Zhoujia Bridge). Our troops were temporarily caught in a bitter battle, but reinforcements arrived in time, encircling and suppressing the enemy from three sides. Although the enemy struggled stubbornly, they completely collapsed by this morning, and the remnants fled by swimming. ㊂ The enemy crossing over from Houjia Dai was larger in number and captured our strongholds of Wujia Shed and Tingtou. After we counterattacked and retook Tingtou in the middle of the night, we formed a tight encirclement with our troops at Zhangzhai and Caijiazhai. Fierce fighting is still ongoing this afternoon, and it is expected that they will be cleared out within the day. ㊃ The enemy's heavy artillery suppression fire is still targeting Beixin Jing and Huacao Town, and was particularly fierce last night and this morning. However, the damage to our fortifications is minimal. ㊄ Our front lines from north of Jiangqiao Town to Xiaonanxiang, Guangfu, and Shixianggong Temple stand firm as a mountain. The enemy did not dare to try lightly this morning, except for artillery bombardment. ㊅ Enemy aircraft constantly scouted over Pudong this morning and dropped bombs aimlessly. Several civilian houses caught fire, but it had absolutely no impact on our military affairs.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Crossing the River at Tingtou and Liujiazhai Have Been Eliminated</h3>
<p>A small number of remaining enemies at Wujia Shed are surrounded. The line at Xiaonanxiang and Guangfu is relatively quiet. Artillery battles along the river remain fierce.</p>
<p>For three days, enemy troops on the north bank of the Suzhou River have repeatedly tried to cross over, attempting to invade our south bank positions. Several points along the coast from Zhoujia Bridge through Beixin Jing to Yaojia Du at Shenji Bangkou have been crossed over. After being severely attacked by us, the two places, Zhoujia Bridge and Beixin Jing, have been almost completely annihilated. Only a very small number of remaining enemies in the Zhoujia Bridge area are entrenched north of Hopeland Road, near Liujiazhai. Yesterday morning, the remaining enemies once tried to break through to the east, rushing near the Toyota Yarn Factory. They were swept by our army with dense machine gun fire, resulting in many casualties. They then retreated back along the river to Liujiazhai. Last night, in order to clear them out, our army tightly surrounded the Liujiazhai area and searched it thoroughly. Although the enemy resisted stubbornly and many were killed, the rest fell into the water and fled. According to reports from the front, the enemy troops crossing the river in the Zhoujia Bridge and Liujiazhai areas have been completely cleared out this morning. There is also no trace of the enemy near the Toyota Yarn Factory, which is guarded by our army.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the enemy who crossed over to the south of the river from Houjia Dai, northwest of Beixin Jing, and Chenjia Du, Shenji Bangkou, occupied the two villages of Wujia Shed and Tingtou on the south bank under the cover of artillery fire as strongholds, attempting to advance southward. The artillery fire continued all day, bombarding our positions. Although the weather was extremely gloomy and cloudy and the air pressure was very low, enemy aircraft were still active at altitudes of over one thousand meters. Our troops responded calmly, monitoring them closely. In the evening, they advanced to suppress and severely attack them. Our artillery teams concentrated their bombardment on the river bank, and machine gun teams targeted Tingtou and Wujia Shed, advancing forward. The forward sentries crawled forward like snakes and threw grenades fiercely. Throughout the night there was artillery fire and infantry charges with close combat. Last night at midnight, the enemy at Tingtou was completely eliminated, and they were driven back, fleeing into the water. The enemy hiding in Wujia Shed was tightly surrounded by our army and will be resolved soon.</p>
<p>This morning, the enemy's artillery fire is still concentrated on our positions along the river. A large number of enemy aircraft are active in the hazy air, scouting and bombing. Our positions have not changed at all.</p>
<p>North of Shenji Bang, from Jiangqiao Town to Xiaonanxiang Guangfu, the enemy troops have repeatedly attacked but have been repelled. The line was relatively quiet this morning.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the army reported at 12:00 noon on the 2nd that the sound of artillery fire on both banks of the Suzhou River west of Shanghai has continued for over fifty hours. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy attempted to cross the river for the second time, and after our interception, fierce fighting continued until dawn today. Most of the enemy in the Liujiazhai area has been annihilated, and the remaining ugly elements, having no foothold, stealthily retreated at dawn, so there is no trace of the enemy there. The ones who crossed over at Houjia Dai were forced westward by our pressure, and there are still over a hundred people surrounded by us in the civilian houses of Wujia Ku. The enemy's retreat route has been cut off, so they are still stubbornly resisting. Because the enemy has suffered heavy losses from repeated attempts to cross the river in the past two days, they have been using artillery to bombard the entire line from Zhongshan Road to Shenji Bang on the south bank since last night. The roaring sound continued throughout the night. After dawn today, several enemy aircraft bombed in support, and our army also returned fire with artillery. The sound of artillery had not stopped by noon.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the army reported at 12:30 PM on the 2nd that at about 2:00 AM this morning, about 300 enemy soldiers used smoke screens to cover their attempt to cross the river from the Chenjia Du area. Our army advanced from Liujiazhai, approaching the shore and swept machine guns into the smoke. Only a few landed on the south bank, but after being surrounded in three places, they were completely annihilated by 4:30 AM. The enemy deaths reached more than 130.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attempt to Land in Pudong Failed</h3>
<p>Driven away in panic after being severely attacked by us</p>
<p>Military news: At about 7:00 AM this morning, enemy warships in the Huangpu River once again shelled Pudong, attempting to cover the landing of enemy troops in the Chunjiang Wharf area. However, our army was fully prepared. When the enemy approached, they immediately fired with machine guns. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the enemy troops fled in panic, and the enemy's attempt ultimately failed to be implemented.</p>
<p>At 9:30 this morning, when enemy aircraft were scouting and bombing in Pudong, enemy warships in the Huangpu River frequently shelled, creating a tense situation for a while after their joint sea-air operation. Our entire line issued orders to be on high alert. The enemy warships fired a total of over twenty shells and then fell silent again. The reporter later visited an officer. According to him, there is absolutely no danger to the Pudong positions. There are enemy small motorboats carrying soldiers in the Huangpu River, traveling back and forth between Hongkou and Yangshupu, but it is purely patrolling in nature and they have never dared to take any active action. Moreover, our defensive lines are solid and the guards are tight. Enemy boats cannot easily approach the shore, let alone land. In short, the stability of the entire Pudong line is as usual.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Indiscriminately Bombarded Western Shanghai and Pudong This Morning</h3>
<p>Aircraft from Nanshi flew to scout but did not drop bombs. Disappeared in the afternoon due to heavy rain.</p>
<p>Starting at dawn this morning, large numbers of enemy giant aircraft were active in the sky, flying to western Shanghai along the Suzhou River and various places in Pudong, wantonly bombing. At around 10:00 AM, the sky suddenly became overcast and rainy, and enemy aircraft gradually decreased. However, even though it was raining heavily after 1:00 PM, there were still one or two enemy aircraft continuing to wreak havoc in the Pudong area. By 1:30 PM, enemy aircraft had disappeared. As for the Nanshi area, although a few enemy aircraft flew to scout, they did not drop any bombs.</p>
<p>West of Shanghai: Large teams of enemy aircraft wantonly bombed the area west of Shanghai starting at dawn this morning, dropping two or three bombs each time, or seven or eight bombs at most. The roaring sound shook the entire Shanghai area. They had not left by 1:00 PM this afternoon. The losses are under investigation. Starting at 6:00 AM this morning, six enemy aircraft scouted back and forth over the areas of Lujiadu, Yangjiadu, Zhangjiabang, Tangqiao, and Yangjing in Pudong. At around 8:00 AM, they dropped more than twenty bombs in Lujiadu and Yangjiadu successively, and frequently strafed with machine guns at low altitude, destroying more than ten civilian houses and killing and injuring many residents. They escaped at around 10:00 AM, and three more aircraft returned to drop bombs in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Nanshi: At around 5:00 AM this morning, there was first one aircraft, then it increased to three aircraft, and by 8:00 AM, it had increased to six aircraft, constantly circling and scouting over the areas of the railway station, Gaochangmiao, the city, and the 16 Ponds, but did not drop any bombs. Before long, they fled south. However, because the enemy had threatened two days ago to bomb Nanshi, residents have been flocking to the concessions in recent days. The area where the Chinese and foreign concessions meet was still extremely crowded with vehicles today. At noon, an enemy aircraft flew to Longhua and dropped six bombs, injuring four civilians.</p>
<p>Pudong: Pudong was again subjected to heavy bombing by enemy aircraft this morning. When it was not yet dawn at 5:00 AM, there were already three enemy aircraft flying over the sky. Residents were all awakened by the creaking sound of the aircraft. Seeing the lights on the enemy aircraft flickering on and off, they flew away half an hour later. At 8:30 AM, three more bombers came to scout along the coast and circled several times, before heading to the eastern villages and dropping bombs continuously. Seven bombs were dropped in Qianjia Lane, destroying four civilian houses and killing one girl. Eight bombs were dropped in Yinshici Yangdian, destroying fifteen civilian houses. Two bombs were dropped at Caotou An, destroying three civilian houses. Three bombs were dropped on Shenjia Street, two on Erluo Street, and no damage was done to Yiluo Street, destroying one civilian house and crushing an old woman to death. Two bombs were dropped on Zhangjia Building, with no deaths or injuries. Also, yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, enemy aircraft dropped one bomb in Xiaopudong, injuring Wu Zhang's wife. One bomb was dropped in Tiandu Nei, destroying one house and injuring Sheng Yugen. Three bombs were dropped in Shenjia Nong, destroying five civilian houses, killing one man, and injuring residents Wang Zhukun and Shen Chao Fa. One bomb was dropped in Shiba Jian, destroying one house and injuring Fan Xiuqing.</p>
<h3>Relief Society's Municipal Branch Sends Representatives to Pay Condolences to Martyred British Soldiers</h3>
<p>The society also expressed its gratitude to the British army for assisting in rescuing refugees, and sent a formal letter of thanks to the army commander yesterday.</p>
<p>During the recent change in the defense line of our army in Zhabei, the war extended to western Shanghai, and as a result, the British military camp in the area was also subjected to indiscriminate shelling by the Japanese side, killing three people. Their bodies have been placed in coffins at the International Funeral Home. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, a memorial service was held at the funeral home. All sectors of society in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, deeply regretted their unfortunate deaths because the British army maintained order and rescued refugees with utmost courage. They sent condolences one after another. The Municipal Relief Society also specially dispatched Secretary-General Mao Yun and Reception Group Director Cai Renbao as representatives of the society and the 100,000 refugees in the city to pay condolences and make every effort. They specially sent a letter of thanks yesterday: "During this time when our army changed its defense line in Zhabei, tens of thousands of our compatriots in the area were in danger and rushed out of danger. Under the fierce shelling of enemy artillery, their lives were at risk. Fortunately, your army provided full assistance and rescued them to a safe area, especially assisting the elderly, weak, women, and children. This moral spirit full of human sympathy and enthusiastic courage is not only the glory of your army, but also a great manifestation of the national civilization of your country. Our compatriots in the enemy country are all deeply grateful and will always remember it. Our association is in charge of relief, and after witnessing it, we are even more grateful. We hereby send a formal letter of thanks, hoping that your army commander will take note of it and forward it to all your colleagues in the army."</p>
<h3>French Catholic Churches Oppose Bombing</h3>
<p>Requests that the government lodge a protest</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that since the enemy army authorities threatened the residents of Nanshi, saying they would carry out a large-scale bombing, the residents there have been fleeing for safety, and the scene is extremely tragic. Due to the rain in recent days, no enemy aircraft have gone to carry out the bombing. However, according to reporters, Catholic and Christian churches have a large number of properties in the Nanshi urban area, accounting for more than one-third of all properties. Among them, French Catholic churches occupy the most. Therefore, all the churches are very angry now, believing that Nanshi is not a strategic point in the war, but the Japanese army intends to indiscriminately carry out bombing, harming civilians and private property, which is an act of violence unrelated to combat and is not permitted by international law. Therefore, they have requested their national government to lodge a protest with the Japanese authorities to oppose the bombing of Nanshi, so as to avoid endangering foreign properties.</p>
<h3>A Tour of Nanshi</h3>
<p>Residents flee to the concessions, shops still operate as usual, and the Citizens' Corps maintains order</p>
<p>Since the enemy announced the bombing of Nanshi, yesterday was sunny, and two enemy aircraft flew over Nanshi. At 4:00 PM, three enemy aircraft dropped bombs on Xinma Road in the Yangjiadu area of Pudong. Their circling range extended to the eastern half of the city, so residents of Nanshi hired vehicles to move to the concessions. Vehicle prices soared several times. However, the number of people entering Nanshi recently is no less than 100,000, and the iron gates leading to the French Concession are only at four locations: Fenglin Bridge in western Shanghai, and Niaolang Road in Xieqiao, Nanyang Bridge in Ximen, and the Old North Gate. The traffic is only through the two iron gates. Although the French Concession authorities attach importance to humanitarianism and do not require passes, the entrance and exit are too small, and the refugees are more numerous, so order is inevitably disrupted. Therefore, the patrols at the iron gate ordered the guards to let a large number of people enter at a time, so the lines near the entrance were almost half a li long. Among them, the Nanyang Bridge and Old North Gate were the most crowded. The Nanyang Bridge section stretched from both the Old West Gate and Fangbang Bridge to Nanyang Bridge, with vehicles connected and sometimes stopping, with as many as several thousand vehicles. The Old North Gate along Mingguo Road was also blocked by vehicles starting from the New North Gate. Therefore, in the afternoon from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, in order to maintain order, pedestrians exiting the iron gate were temporarily held for half an hour. Then, one iron gate was opened at Nanyang Bridge to let the people exiting the iron gate out, so as to avoid blocking both sides. However, some returning women hired vehicles to enter the iron gate at 3:00 PM and waited at the end of the line, but they could not squeeze in until the evening, and the curfew time had arrived, so they had to return home in the same vehicle, and the loss was already irreparable. As for the houses along the road where the Chinese and French borders meet along Mingguo Road and Lanweiman Road, all front and back doors were nailed shut by the police authorities because some people had false passes and sought profit. However, after the relocation in these two days, this morning the reporter investigated inside and outside the city and along the Pudong area. All shops along the roads were operating as usual. However, there were very few buyers in the small vegetable market, indicating that there were few residents. As for the government agencies, judicial agencies, such as the Shanghai Local Court, were still working as usual. There are currently 600 prisoners in the detention center, and because of the shortage of yellow millet for prisoners' food, white rice is temporarily issued. Police agencies, such as the police stations, still have police standing guard at important intersections. Other civic groups, such as citizen training and defense groups, are making efforts to maintain order along the way. Currently, almost all positions around the city of Nanshi are the responsibility of citizen training.</p>
<h3>All Sectors of Society in Xuzhou Donate a Large Number of Cotton Clothes</h3>
<p>[Xuzhou] Citizens from all sectors of Xuzhou and Bu donated a large number of cotton clothes. On the 31st, they requested Commissioner Shao Hanyuan to send telegrams to Wang Zhonglian, Wang Jingjiu, and Sun Yuanliang's three divisions, presenting 2,500 pieces and hoping that they would work hard to resist the enemy and sacrifice themselves for the country. Archbishop Tai Yiou, the archbishop of the Catholic Church in Xuzhou, prays for the victory of our soldiers at the front every day, and blesses the refugees in the war zone to avoid disaster (1st telegram).</p>
<h3>Our Army Sends a Large Number of Reinforcements to Shanxi</h3>
<p>A portion moves south from northern Shanxi to join Yangquan. The left wing of our army on the Pinghan Line is advancing towards Gaoyi.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Chinese military authorities are now dispatching a large number of reinforcements to Shanxi to stop the Japanese army's offensive towards Taiyuan. According to this, a semi-official source claimed that a portion of a certain route army is now moving south from northern Shanxi to join the large army concentrated in Yangquan. The Chinese army believes that Taiyuan is related to the entire war situation in Shanxi, so the Yangquan line has decided to defend it desperately under any circumstances. The Chinese army on the Pinghan Line is also preparing to launch a large-scale counteroffensive near the Zhang River (2nd National Daily Telegram).</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Our left wing on the Pinghan Line has recovered Baixiang and is advancing towards Gaoyi. Also, four enemy aircraft bombed more than ten bombs on the Longhai Line between Haozhai and Jiaxi, killing several people. It is reported that one aircraft self-immolated and fell to the ground (31st Special Telegram).</p>
<h3>Our Army Advances More Than Twenty Li North of the Tuhai River on the Jinpu Line</h3>
<p>[Jinan] On the Jinpu Line, on the 1st, our guard troops advanced more than twenty li north of the Tuhai River. The enemy is still actively building defensive works. We clashed with small enemy units from time to time and repelled all enemy troops. A certain unit on the right wing has annihilated more than half of the enemy at Fenghuangdian. The enemy is still fighting. In the area of Zhoujia Zhai and Zhangguan Dian, more than twenty li southwest of Pingyuan, there are two to three hundred enemy infantry. At noon on the 31st, after a fierce attack by our army, many enemies were killed. The enemy has retreated into the city, and there is no trace of the enemy in the Zhoujia Zhai area (1st Central News Agency Telegram).</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Guide, One Shot Down</h3>

<h3>Short Comments</h3>
<p>— Phase</p>
<p>Belgian capital telegram. According to private sources, Japan intends to accept the United States to serve as a mediator to resolve the Far East situation. However, the Chinese government must first agree to direct negotiations with Japan. This kind of news is somewhat ridiculous. Because direct negotiations between China and Japan failed, there was an undeclared war. Now that the war has been fought for eighty days, direct negotiations are still being held, then the various sacrifices of the undeclared war in the eighty days are meaningless. This is ridiculous. First, our country's resistance war has long been determined. If we don't fight, it's over. If we fight, there is no reason to stop halfway. Then, when the League of Nations meeting was held, our country had reasons to state and requested the League of Nations to make a public judgment. This is indeed an expression that our member states should have. The League of Nations could not solve it, so there was a proposal to convene a Nine-Power Treaty meeting. Now that the general meeting is about to open, and still returns to direct negotiations, then the act of convening the Nine-Power Treaty meeting is really superfluous. This is ridiculous. Second, and Japan accepts the United States to serve as a mediator, which means that the United States is responsible for mediating. Now that our government wants to approve direct negotiations with Japan, Japan's acceptance of the United States to serve as a mediator is a great mockery of the world.</p>
<h3>Nine-Power Conference to Open Tomorrow Amidst Brutal Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>Delegations from all countries gather in the Belgian capital. Chinese students in Europe demand sanctions against Japan. British political circles express pessimism about the future of the conference.</p>
<p>Belgian capital: The Chinese delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference arrived here this afternoon. The chief representative is Gu Weijun, the ambassador to France, and the vice-chief representatives are Guo Taiqi, the ambassador to the United Kingdom, and Qian Tai, the ambassador to Belgium. Other members of the delegation are Jin Wensi, the minister to the Netherlands, Hu Shize, the minister to Switzerland, Yang Yinpu, an expert from the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations, Shi Jibian, a counselor at the Chinese Embassy in France, Liu Pu, a first secretary at the British Embassy, and Yang Guangxing, a columnist for the Shanghai Continental News. During the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Yang will specialize in the intelligence work of the Chinese delegation (1st Central News Agency Havas Telegram).</p>
<p>⊙Brussels: On the eve of the opening of the Beijing Conference today, student groups here issued an appeal, asking the delegations attending the meeting to do their best to help China and sanction Japan. The declaration also listed the Japanese army's atrocities of destroying Chinese universities and bombing undefended cities (2nd Haitian Telegram).</p>
<p>⊙Beijing: British Foreign Secretary Eden left London last night to come to Beijing, accompanied by Colonial Minister Malcolm MacDonald and Undersecretary of the Foreign Office, Cadogan. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and Deputy Minister Bodankin also set off from Moscow on Sunday to come here. As for the American delegation led by Chief Representative Davis, it arrived here on October 28 (2nd Central News Agency Reuters Telegram).</p>
<p>[Paris] French Foreign Minister Dalbos set off for Beijing at 11:30 this morning. Other members of the French delegation are Secretary of State Tedesan, Undersecretary of Colonial Affairs Monetville, Assistant Deputy of the League of Nations Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Laicode, Assistant Deputy of the Asian Division, Heberno (former Counselor of the Embassy in China), and several experts and consultants (2nd Central News Agency Havas Telegram).</p>
<p>[Rome] The Italian delegation set off for Beijing last night, with the former ambassador to Germany, Maris Cotti, as the chief representative (2nd National Haitian Telegram).</p>
<p>⊙Lisbon: The Portuguese government has appointed Minister to Belgium, Casteiro, as the chief representative to attend the Nine-Power Conference, with Ambassador to the United States, Bi Yanji, as his deputy (1st Central News Agency Havas Telegram).</p>
<p>[London] There is great concern here about the situation in the Far East. Political figures are very pessimistic about the prospects of the Beijing Conference. Especially with Japan's refusal to attend, they are extremely disappointed. It is said that since the method of economic joint sanctions has been decided not to be adopted, the only possibility for the meeting is to first call on the belligerents to mediate, and second to obtain the understanding of all countries on the attitude of the final result, so as to decide on the steps to be taken to end the war. It is believed that the future of the conference depends largely on the cooperation of the joint actions of Britain and the United States, and it is expected that the US representative Davis has received detailed instructions on this matter. The Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's suspension of Brussels has also increased the pessimism here (1st Haitian News Agency Telegram).</p>

<h3>Italy Joins the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact</h3>
<p>Military mutual assistance in nature. Can be signed this week.</p>
<p>[Rome] According to authoritative sources here tonight, Italy is scheduled to join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact this week. According to this agreement, it was signed in Berlin on November 25, 1936 by the German Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ribbentrop, and the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Mushanokoji. Italy's accession this time only adds a signature and does not stipulate additional clauses. Germany, Italy, and Japan agreed to mutually notify each other of news about international communist activities and discuss close cooperation in counteracting it, while inviting other countries to participate together. Italy's accession to the agreement will be signed jointly by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop, and Japanese Ambassador to Italy Hotta. It is said that the scope of this agreement will never be expanded. In other words, there is no military nature (1st Haitian Telegram).</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Organizes a Wartime General Headquarters</h3>
<p>Major Personnel Changes in the Army; Hata and Koiso Promoted to Generals</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Amidst the development of the Sino-Japanese war, important opinions have arisen within the Japanese government. There is a proposal to establish a wartime general headquarters to achieve the objectives of the China Incident as soon as possible and to ensure that no regrets are left in managing the war. Prime Minister Konoe has been seeking opinions from various sectors, primarily the army and navy. As a result, all parties have unanimously agreed to this plan. Therefore, the government has decided to apply the wartime general headquarters ordinance, which was promulgated during the Russo-Japanese War, and establish a general headquarters in Tokyo. This will realize a wartime system that is both in name and in substance. The timing will be determined after considering the development of the war situation in the Shanghai area and the attitudes of various countries at the Nine-Power Conference. It is expected to be around mid-November. The staff of the general headquarters will likely be composed of the Chief and Vice Chief of the General Staff, the Chief and Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, the Army and Navy Ministers, and the Prime Minister. (2nd United Press Telegram)</p>

<p>⊙Calcutta: Indian National Congress leader Gandhi originally planned to leave here last night with the members of the Working Committee of the National Congress. However, due to high blood pressure and heart problems, his departure has been postponed. At the same time, the members of the Working Committee have also been informed to postpone their departure. This indicates that Gandhi's condition is worrisome. Gandhi is currently 69 years old. (2nd Central News Agency, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Developing Inland Finance Issues</h3>
<p>— Mu Shensi</p>
<p>Our nation's financial system is chaotic and fragmented. The finance in the metropolitan areas and inland areas have not only failed to achieve balanced development, but have even formed a contrast of prosperity versus decline. This has already significantly impacted the national economy and people's livelihoods in peacetime. All the more so now, during this period of war, this is felt even more acutely. Therefore, there is an urgent need to seek to develop inland finance. Let us take a few examples to illustrate this. This year, the rural areas have reported bumper harvests, which could have been used to supplement military and civilian food supplies and consolidate the economic strength of the vast majority of the population. This was originally good news amidst the war of resistance. However, due to the war, there is a lack of buyers for cotton in various regions, and prices have plummeted to unprecedented lows. With the new harvest now appearing, if no remedies are sought, it may lead to a disastrous outcome despite the bumper harvest. This is one example. The movement of factories inland has long attracted the attention of the general public and has already entered the stage of implementation. On the one hand, this effort strives to produce for national defense and civilian industries; on the other hand, it maintains the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers. This is an important issue in the war of resistance. However, financial institutions are needed to provide assistance at any time and in any place. Especially under the current circumstances of the enemy's illegal blockade of the coast, this is an excellent opportunity to actively promote domestic goods and establish a strong foundation. This is a second example. The incomplete and unsound organization of inland finance in our country is of utmost importance to the promotion of the national economy and the facilitation of national finance. As evidence, the current issue of 500 million yuan in national salvation bonds, in proportion to the population, is actually not a large amount. However, after only two months, subscriptions are still insufficient. One cannot ignore that the reason for the slow subscription is that there is no way to universally mobilize subscriptions in the inland areas, and many inland compatriots have not had the opportunity to subscribe according to their capacity. Furthermore, for the sake of a prolonged war of resistance, not only should we ensure that the current national bonds are fully subscribed as soon as possible, but we should also prepare for the issuance of second and third rounds of national bonds. This is a third example.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Battle of Shanghai, the Ministry of Finance promulgated seven measures to stabilize finance, on the one hand to stabilize domestic finance, and on the other hand to prevent capital outflow. The Central Bank, along with the four agricultural banks, jointly established an inland financial development committee to invigorate inland finance and consolidate the national economy. The intention of the financial authorities was extremely thorough. However, because the 'Inland Financial Development Committee' was only distributed in a small number of important cities, the quantity seemed insufficient. As for the measures to stabilize finance, because they were temporary and emergency measures, it was inevitable that they would focus on one aspect while neglecting others. As a result, urban capital failed to flow smoothly to the inland areas, and inland finance also failed to circulate actively. In view of the above-mentioned shortcomings, I would like to offer four points on the essence of developing inland finance:</p>
<p>① Encourage inland remittances: All Shanghai remittance deposits should be allowed to freely remit into the inland areas and paid in legal tender. If remittances are made from the inland areas to Shanghai, they should be paid in remittances. However, in the event of an impractical need, a request may be submitted stating the reasons and requesting approval to pay in legal tender. Furthermore, the carrying of legal tender to Shanghai should be regulated, with a certain amount or more being prohibited and confiscated to prevent capital outflow.</p>
<p>② Open inland deposits: All inland deposits should be freely deposited and withdrawn without restrictions. Deposits require deposits to be made and taken out. If one cannot smoothly take out, one cannot smoothly deposit. Furthermore, Shanghai's fixed-term and current deposits, transferred to the original bank in the inland areas, should be given preferential treatment by exempting remittance fees to encourage them to enrich the economic strength of the rear areas.</p>
<p>③ Establish more inland banks: Banks in our country are not only concentrated in cities, but also set up branch offices in one corner. Now, branch offices or sub-branches should be established in towns and cities in all provinces, expanded where they have been established, and newly established where they have not been established. The original financial organizations in various regions should be supported and improved, and in nearby rural areas, the organization of 'credit cooperatives' should be utilized, subsidized where they exist, and promoted where they do not. Furthermore, one should deeply understand that the principle of management lies in the spirit of division of labor and cooperation. Therefore, one should no longer focus on one corner and engage in unnecessary competition. One must strive to improve the financial organizations in various regions and give full play to their inherent strengths, so as to complete a great national financial network.</p>
<p>④ Expand postal savings services: It is not easy to practically establish branch offices of banks in various places in a short period of time. However, the establishment of post offices is already widespread throughout the country and penetrates into rural areas. Therefore, depending on the situation in various places and the size of the post office, they can undertake all or part of the banking business. On the one hand, they can boldly absorb social idle funds; on the other hand, they can supply funds for enterprises. They can also use the method of import and export of goods to facilitate the financing of transportation and sales. In this way, not only can manpower be saved, but efficiency can also be quickly improved.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned points are implemented separately and promoted vigorously, urban capital can flow smoothly to the inland areas, and the financial function of the inland areas can also be fully developed. The benefits are at least the following: Centralize inland cash reserves, complete legal tender policy, and enrich national wealth; this is one benefit. Promote agricultural, industrial, and mining production, develop natural resources, and enhance the power of resistance; this is a second benefit. Utilize the cooperative financial function, improve the organization of the people, and consolidate order in the rear areas; this is a third benefit. In terms of our country's vast territory, abundant resources, and large population, if the economy is properly managed, then the final victory of the war of resistance will definitely belong to us. In recent years, government departments have spared no effort in promoting the 'National Economic Construction Movement'. I would like to suggest that scholars also use the slogan 'Funds Return to the Countryside'. However, under today's economic circumstances, effective measures must be taken to save the nation from danger. I once recalled that during the European War, the German Minister of Economic Affairs, Helfferich, said, "It must be known that once the national economy falls into stagnation or collapse, the foundation of the country's resistance will immediately be shaken, and it will fall into an irreversible situation." How apt are these words! I hope that the financial community of our country, under the leadership of the financial authorities, will rise up and make plans for this.</p>
<h3>Tragedy of Enemy Bombing in Changshu</h3>
<p>Over a Hundred Houses Destroyed in the West Warehouse Area; Rear of the County High School Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Changshu Correspondence: At 2:30 PM on the 28th, the urban area was again bombed by enemy planes, with up to twenty bombs dropped. The local losses were very serious. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>At about 1:30 PM on that day, the urban area issued an emergency alarm. After a while, six enemy planes came from the southwest. The planes were old-style biplanes. Judging from their direction and time, it seemed that they came to Changshu after their atrocities over Wuxi. When they reached the sky over the urban area, they first circled the city from north to west. Then they began to drop bombs. From 2:35 to 2:57 PM, they went southeast. The bombing lasted for a total of twenty-two minutes. More than twenty bombs were dropped, all falling on the civilian houses in the West Warehouse area, destroying about one hundred houses. At 5:15 PM, the alarm was lifted. Senli High School, seeing the danger in the city, had already sent students to Wangzhuang Town for classes. This time, the enemy planes targeted the school, with four bombs hitting the school. Three bombs fell on the open space of the large playground, leaving three large holes, each about the size of a square table and about three feet deep. One bomb hit the auditorium, completely destroying the girls' dormitory, girls' church, auditorium, teachers' office, principal's office, secretary's office, library, and part of the classrooms in the rear half. The doors and windows on the half of the building along the playground were all damaged and in disarray. Many fragments of bombs were found there, with the words "60 Watt Explosion Bomb" on them. The doors and windows of the front half of the building, such as the boys' dormitory, teachers' bedrooms, classrooms, and Boy Scout office, were also destroyed. Pieces of broken glass were scattered all over the ground. Only one watchman was staying in the school, so he was naturally injured. The most significant losses this time were the school and the Shanghai Guanxi Church at the western end. There were more than twenty casualties.</p>
<h3>City Federation Presents Banners to Soldiers to Express Respect</h3>
<p>The Municipal First Special District Citizens' Federation, in order to express its gratitude and appreciation for the loyalty and bravery of the frontline soldiers in fighting against the war, which has benefited the country, has specially made four red silk banners, embroidered on all four sides, with words of vigilance woven from black velvet in the center. The words are, 'Drums and trumpets should be majestic', 'Swallowing the fierce sun', 'Protecting the country as a city', 'Cutting the thorns for the country', 'National Glory'. The upper inscription is 'To the entire soldiers of a certain army and a certain division' or 'Respectfully presented to a certain general'. The lower inscription is 'Respectfully presented jointly by the chairman and all standing committee members'. It is reported that the Federation has decided to send representatives to present the banners to various armies.</p>
<h3>Traffic Completely Restored South of Garbage Bridge</h3>
<p>People and Vehicles Can Pass Through South Suzhou Road; Trolleybuses Extend Northward</p>
<p>Traffic on the southern section of the New Garbage Bridge, since being blockaded on the afternoon of the 27th of last month, and the concession authorities placing wire and wooden frames across the northern end of Nicheng Bridge to prohibit people from passing east, was opened with a gap in the middle of the wire and wooden frames on the morning of the 31st of last month, allowing pedestrians to enter and exit through the gap, restoring traffic between Nicheng Bridge and Xiamen Road. However, vehicles were still prohibited from passing through. As of this morning (2nd), the concession authorities have widened the gap in the wire and wooden frames placed on Nicheng Bridge, with the distance between the two ends of the remaining space being more than 20 feet. Therefore, pedestrians and vehicles are allowed to pass through from Nicheng Bridge to the South Suzhou River bank. The terminus of the 18th route trolleybus has also been extended to the New Garbage Bridge pier.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Implement Economic Severance Against Japan</h3>
<p>Central Bank Suspends Trading in Japanese Exchange Rates; Refuses to Accept Japanese Bank Drafts and Checks</p>
<p>After the Banking and Money Shop Association issued a notice implementing economic severance against Japan, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Banking and Money Shop Association that: ① Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, banks have automatically stopped all transactions with Japanese commercial banks. At the same time, the Central Bank has suspended the listing and trading of Japanese exchange rates. ② Money shops have never had direct transactions with Japanese commercial banks. Now, Japanese commercial banks' drafts, checks, etc., have been uniformly refused. Furthermore, the Japanese commercial banks in Shanghai are Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Sumitomo Bank, Bank of Korea, Shanghai Bank, and Hankou Bank. Their Chinese employees have already resigned voluntarily. As for the banknotes of Japanese commercial banks, they have long been rejected in our country's market.</p>
<h3>Banking and Money Shop Industry Develops Internal Remittances and Loans to Purchase Agricultural Products</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that various important industries have been moved to the interior to start operations, and people from all provinces and cities in Shanghai have also returned to their hometowns to seek a livelihood, the internal remittance business of the banking and money shop industry in the city has suddenly become active due to the influx of funds into the interior. All banks and shops are planning to set up branches and offices in the interior to meet the needs. In addition, this year the climate is suitable, and rainfall is well-distributed, and there has been a bumper harvest of agricultural products in various places. However, due to enemy planes bombing everywhere, those who purchase agricultural products such as cotton are not as enthusiastic as in the past. Now, in order to regulate the rural economy and facilitate the flow of food and daily necessities, it has been decided that each of the inland branches and shops should prepare a certain amount of loans to support industry, commerce, and farmers in purchasing agricultural products. According to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau are currently processing loans in various places according to the planned plans. The Agricultural Credit Administration is actively preparing for agricultural warehouse loans, marketing loans, and agricultural product pledges, and is preparing to collect a large amount of agricultural products to meet the needs of a long-term war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Trade Unions Need to Emphasize Propaganda Work for National Salvation</h3>
<p>Bing</p>
<p>The Trade Union Association for National Salvation, in order to expand the propaganda for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and the Defend Greater Shanghai Movement, has specially dispatched more than 300 propaganda teams today to conduct propaganda on various roads, and carry a large number of propaganda materials, slogans, etc. in order to distribute and post them, so as to awaken the citizens of the whole city and strengthen the work of national salvation. The fourth issue of the Association's National Salvation Journal was also published today. In order to grasp the current situation, its content also focuses on defending Greater Shanghai. In addition, when conducting the burial service for the English soldier, the association also sent a representative to participate in the funeral and presented a wreath to express condolences.</p>
<h3>The Task of Intellectual Youth Today</h3>
<p>"Who is the new force of China? Only we youth!</p>
<p>Who is the transformer of the world? Only we youth!</p>
<p>Full of spirit, healthy body, passionate emotions, firm will,</p>
<p>Aspiring and promising without limit, only we youth!"</p>
<p>Youth Song, taken from the Military Songs Collection</p>
<p>Since the "July 8th" and "August 13th" incidents occurred, our government decided to launch a full-scale war of resistance against Japan. Therefore, in South China and North China, we have armed youth who are giving full play to their full spirit, strong physique, passionate emotions, and firm will, and are fighting for the survival of the nation every day. But what about intellectual youth?</p>
<p>Most of the intellectual youth are college and middle school students and primary school teachers. The former number no less than 600,000, and the latter number no less than 500,000. These millions of intellectual youth also have a full spirit, a strong physique, passionate emotions, and a firm will, and also have rich knowledge. They can certainly exert unlimited power for the nation. However, in fact, what is currently being demonstrated is only very small efforts such as fundraising, condolences, and running wall newspapers.</p>
<p>I don't want intellectual youth to all arm themselves and go to the front line, because this is not necessary at the moment, and it is a great loss to the nation to let the outstanding members of the country only exert the effectiveness of a soldier. I definitely don't want them to do that.</p>
<p>We have now lost a part of the Great Wall on the national defense line, but the loyal and brave armed youth have already created a wall of flesh and blood on the front line for the country. We also hope that intellectual youth can create a spiritual Great Wall in the rear.</p>
<p>What is the spiritual Great Wall? Organized and trained people will be our greatest force in the war of resistance in the future, and will write our most enduring force in the war of resistance in the future. Therefore, the spiritual Great Wall that we hope to create is to create these organized and trained people.</p>
<p>Today's Northeasterners are even willing to be pioneers for the enemy. This is the reason why our spiritual Great Wall has not been completed.</p>
<p>Today's Beiping has a seminar for primary and secondary school teachers, with the purposes of "good neighborliness" and "anti-Party rule." This is the reason why our spiritual Great Wall has never been completed.</p>
<p>Along the Jinghu Road and Huhang Road today, there are often traitors found. Some of them are willing to be traitors for a few dimes of living expenses, and some even do not know that they have become traitors. This is also the reason why our spiritual Great Wall has not been completed.</p>
<p>We can no longer delay building this spiritual Great Wall. We hope that these millions of intellectual youth will quickly undertake this great project!</p>
<p>Organizing the people should start with the organization of intellectual youth themselves. Training the people should start with the training of intellectual youth themselves. At present, many colleges and middle schools in the war zone have suspended classes, and even in non-war zones, there are schools that have suspended classes due to continuous enemy bombings. Especially in Shanghai, there are a large number of intellectual youth who have fled from Tianjin. These out-of-school college and middle school students and unemployed primary school teachers can receive short-term necessary training under the guidance of government agencies or anti-enemy support associations and other groups, and form simple and practical organizations in groups of five or ten. Then, going deep into the interior, even deeper into the countryside, they can organize and train the vast masses of people.</p>
<p>For the organization of the people, we can use the existing organizations such as Baojia, but we must make them sound, upright and practical.</p>
<p>For the training of the people, in addition to teaching wartime common sense, national geography, international situation, etc., we should also pay more attention to the four virtues of etiquette, justice, integrity, and shame to cultivate noble integrity.</p>
<p>As for the college and middle school students and primary school teachers who are not currently suspended or will soon attend classes, they should also allocate a portion of their time to do this work. However, it can be limited to the local area. For this major work, our national Boy Scouts should exert a greater force than they have exerted in the past!</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to offer a passage from a reporter from the Ta Wan Pao as a warning to the youth of our country:</p>
<p>"If the Chinese people all embrace the determination to coexist with the country or perish with the country, even if the political power of China in the area where I live is blocked by the enemy in the future, I will still fight for the country, not abandon it because of hardship, and not shrink back because of violence, then even if the cavalry tramples all over China, China will still be united and survive. Our final victory depends on this... It is of course important to use artillery to resist the enemy's invasion, but after the artillery resistance fails, our only Great Wall is the united hearts of the people."</p>
