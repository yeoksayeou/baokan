<h3>風雨凄其上海全市昨淪陷</h3>
<p>尚有軍警作最後犧牲</p>
<p>奉令堅守南市之軍警、在敵軍猛烈之砲火中、艱苦抗禦、至前晚十一時、終以工事被毀、無堅可憑、乃奉令撤退、惟昨尚有一部軍警、在頑敵環攻下、仍誓死抗戰、在凄風慘雨之中、傳來疏落之槍砲聲、至午四時許、槍聲沉寂、我大上海遂完全淪陷敵手、昨據記者據悉南市失守之慘痛經過、誌錄於後、以為大上海淪亡之最後報道、敵於十日午開始、向南市總攻、以飛機二三十架、及海陸大砲、集中轟擊、敵部亦不斷進犯、至十一日午二時許、砲聲未絕、我防守第一道防綫之五五師張旅、在猛烈之砲火中、艱苦支持至二十餘小時、終以工事被毀、傷亡重大、被敵突破、我軍全綫、由三十五里縮至十五里、陣地益蹙、勢瀕危急、我接到警報後、立命防守十六舖沿江之軍警趕往局門路增援、扼守陸家浜路之第二道防綫、敵於衝過日暉港以後、卽以坦克車五輛為先導、掩護大隊步兵、如潮湧而至、我警察中隊長鍾楊親率警士、扼守局門路徽甯路等處抗戰、雖實力懸殊、但仍奮勇應付、鍾隊長竟以身殉、而為敵衝過、直趨城廂、其時敵並以大砲轟擊我沿江陣地、並以橡皮艇載敵軍偷渡來犯、我十六舖及西門分局官警馳往助戰、卒以該地國防工事兩座、為敵砲轟燬、全體官警、悉作壯烈犧牲、但仍有一部孤軍、在敵三面包圍之中决死抗戰、自午五時至八時、血戰最劇予敵以重創、旋復奉到命令、至午夜十一時、始全部作有秩序之撤退、惟尚有軍警一隊、不顧退去、堅求成仁、以竟其志、相持至昨午四時頗有犧牲者、</p>
<h3>沿浦我軍艱苦奮鬥</h3>
<p>我堅守南市最後陣地張旅及警察總隊、在敵砲火彈雨之下、艱苦奮鬥、終以工事被毀、且水斷糧絕、故於前午奉到命令撤退、大部已於深夜退去、惟尚有一部據守外馬路關橋以南、沿浦之市倉庫•寗紹棧房之部隊、因未奉到命令、故在敵軍重圍之中、仍沉着抗戰誓以最後一滴血、以盡其衛國守士之責、敵軍砲擊澈夜未停、其步兵則未飮衝入、昨晨並有敵橡皮艇數艘、由浦江駛近該處、經我軍以機關槍掃射後、卽行逃去、我軍堅守至昨日下午、方向安全地點撤退、</p>
<h3>半淞園畔英勇殺敵</h3>
<p>南市陸家浜路以南、車站路以東至浦邊半淞園附近一帶、另有我守軍一部約數百人、因未奉到命令、昨仍在繼續與敵艱苦抗戰、該處我軍、自前晚起、三面被敵重重包圍、敵方除用重砲猛烈轟擊外、並以鐵甲車為掩護、曾數度向我守軍衝刺、但因我該批守軍成抱與陣地共存亡决心、必欲向敵軍索取相當代價、故皆佔據各處高樓、以機關槍密集向敵掃射、激戰至下午、我守軍方向後撤退、</p>
<h3>奉南川同時淪陷</h3>
<p>地方損失之巨首推南橋</p>
<p>奉南川三縣、至昨日止、已全部淪陷茲據奉賢某君於昨晨出險到滬報告敵人先頭部隊、均為偽軍改編、黑色制服、並有持手槍、穿便衣大帽者、到卽不許人民遷避、勒令嚮導、四出搜索、凡有嫌疑、或對答不淸之輩、便加禁閉、敵正式部隊完全黃服、帽邊各有金綫、一係從盛梓廟•莊行•拓林•西新市等處過來、各要隘盤查甚嚴、某君經過南橋附近、忽遇敵軍、喝問職業、經上前說明、由一口操台州音之便衣探解釋以四元代價、得到通行證一紙、始免於難、至地方損失之巨、首推南橋、至奉城•南高橋等處、連日來被敵艦之砲、敵機之轟炸、已成焦土、至東鄕靑村港等地、據該處某花廠探報、地方尚少騷擾、小本商店、仍有交易、蓋至今尚未發現敵踪也、南匯方面、亦於十二日前、同時失陷、外間並謠傳川沙縣、已有偽組織維持會發現之說、確否待證、逃滬難民、南匯較多、奉賢次之、川沙最少、現南匯江倬雲等會同浦東同鄕會設法救濟外、奉賢昨在本埠樂園開會設立留滬難民登記處、先行調查、</p>
<h3>浦東敵軍總數逾萬</h3>
<p>大部開往浦南一帶</p>
<p>自敵軍先頭部隊、於前晨佔據浦東後、繼續增援、已達萬名以上、其中半數、係身材高大口操國語之滿洲兵、每三人中、必有一敵兵監視、携帶大批輜重軍器、已於昨晨經過周浦、向奉賢縣浦南邊開去、俾興金山嘴登陸進擾松江之敵軍、取得聯絡、向滬杭路一帶進犯、</p>
<h3>平湖乍浦被炸詳情</h3>
<p>獨山附近有激戰</p>
<p>昨據平湖同鄕會負責人戴桐秋君報告、平湖及乍浦被炸消息如下、（該項消息由平湖逃來之同鄕口述）本月三日接金山衛•新倉•等處警報、一部份商店停業、四日、敵飛機五六架、自晨至晚、竟日偵察城區民衆、紛向西門及北門以外逃避、敵機未投彈、五日下午三時起、敵機開始自南門外及城區轟炸、共投彈三十餘枚、郵政局•電話局•王公昌•王祥和•及大小街弄、均被炸燬、其他各區、未目睹不詳、乍浦方面、據自乍浦逃來之潤餘社社員述稱、乍浦南門外車站、大王廟•迎龍橋•及附近民房均被炸、城內三山會館、中心小學、徐宅祠堂、及西門大街、北門外吊橋、亦於四日被炸、死傷頗多、又該會昨得可靠報告、平湖乍浦、仍在我軍堅守中、惟離乍浦東九里之獨山附近有激戰、獨山有九個山峯、矗立海濱、敵圖越山侵乍浦、必難進展、</p>
<h3>我放棄南市浦東後現扼守新陣地</h3>
<p>廣福黃渡陣地鞏固　靑浦松江仍在我手</p>
<p>中央社南京十二日路透電、此間接華人方面消息、華軍委棄浦東南市後、現扼守新陣地、以松江為右翼、黃渡為中央、廣福為左翼、華軍刻與在杭州灣登陸之日軍戰於泗涇附近、第二道防綫設於靑浦松江現仍在華軍之手、同時此間接寗波電話、日軍在觀海衞登陸之說不確、惟日軍艦在海鹽附近、甚形活動、</p>

<h3>字林西報著論慰勉我上海同胞</h3>
<p>成敗尚有待諸將來　因痛苦而益求自新　屠殺破壞不能損我民族靈魂</p>
<p>字林報昨載社論曰、摧殘上海中心之戰神、已離此而遠去矣、但上海仍須受其纏擾、而不能逃避使戰神遠去之鐵箍所加之壓力、華軍之守衛上海四周防綫、初以為不能逾二三星期、今其退走、一般華人、不得不為懊喪、彼等或因其防守之勇敢、並因士兵曾奮鬥以使敵軍之前進、付高昂之代價、而為之鼓舞亦未可知、惟當上海以外之戰事方在展開、成敗尚待諸將來之際、復回至中立態度之沉默、其所受之感觸、凡各國人民之與同處者、應向表示同情而致敬者也、雖在此種事件表示同情、為益無多、然中國人民當知此間與中國他處外僑一大部分、因華人所遭之艱困、極為痛心、且對於彼等抵抗外國侵略所作之犧牲、深為憐憫、世界第六大城三百餘萬華人、在此重大國難之中、今暫與其政府及國家斷絕直接與無拘束之接觸時、保持政治上死後之種種、實不能對之吹毛求疵、一盎斯重之誠意的同時與體諒、價值實等於一噸重之勸告與儆誡、今對採取國家尊嚴所需之堅忍的抑制、作精神的鼓勵、或不失其適當範圍也、</p>
<p>上海以整個而論、當然視目前事勢之轉變、為其自己困難又入一幕之徵𧰼、雖戰事恐慌之嚴重性、行將消滅、然此種困難、似不致因而减輕也、今所需者、為市民合作之發展、第此種合作、時時使個人與團體陷於進退維谷之地位、在此種局勢中、外人當承認彼等負有調整每日生活使適合現實之義務、或有因若干人受有痛苦、而以為上海之災難、確由於中政府决議以上海為抵抗日本侵略主要地點所致、斷定此事、當就理論與事實、善用其智慧、尋常人士、多對時事之進行、作表面之合法估計、日人所稱上海之活劇、乃中政府剛愎與破壞條約所釀成、此言未可輕信、此種思想、恐足使外人意見趨入歧途、故今當重申若干廣大之理由焉、日本在華北所取之行動實迫中政府與其人民於承認繼續吞蝕其土地、而危及其國家之完整、與對絕大優勢之武力、忍痛抵抗二途之中、擇一行之日本不能自以為其有譴責此項選擇後果之權、此為上海問題今日所最難解之點、外人情感之受衝動、當然更形重大、因兩主要國之戰爭、雖非有計畫的、不幸已損害上海經濟安全所賴之中立國人龐大之利益也、此點目前縱不能受確切之解釋、但亦未便予以漠視、在相當期內、此間非第三方面之漁利者所遭之不幸、卽非日人團體被迫於生命財產所受之許多危險、如此次上海事務重大危機之最後解决（雖此事或將為中日關係間更大之爭端、尚有公道者、則必提出考慮也、</p>
<p>彼抱戰爭應限於華北之見解者、實圖倡成中國在適合日本之戰地外另擇一地、與日為抗、難辭其咎之理論、上海確似有一九三二年五月間之淞滬協定為庇、要知該協定未經雙方調印、且為一種臨時辦法、今旣不能接受中國破壞協定、凖備自衛方法、以抗日本政策在此間與各處顯明可能性之責言、蓋此種責言全以事實侈談幻想三者幾不可分解之糾結為根據也、復不能詳細釋明時常發展之論題、卽破壞協定、非任何一方面所專行者是、而事有須聲明有、中國於其主權上遭遇武力之攻擊、審察一切環境、而在其視為能以有力的打擊甚至為摧毀的打擊、加於侵略者之處而施打擊、固名正言順也、至其對於在此大城作戰將釀成重大損失、作適當考慮時、曾否加以估計將來之評論者、必將决定之、此點非俟自廣州至北平之全面戰爭最後之結果已明時、不能妄加判决、上海今日急宜自固、以忍受經濟上政治上社會上重大之困難、而憂懼與悲觀、充滿全城、上海今正為攻軍包圍成功、然當憶此鋼圈之外、與南京首都之外、伏有中國人道與中國勇氣偉大波動之集團、無論災患現似已釀成重大糜爛、而有具體之專實存在、但此實為中國最後復原與解脫外國覊軛之熱誠、在相當期內、中國重大之需要、必復投於本城本港、而負助其繁榮之責任、並證明上海之前途、為中國進步商業上與財政上的輔助之信念、此可為上海担保者也、再就精神而言、事實乃屬鐵證、屠殺與破壞、决不能損害此偉大民族之靈魂、且反將使彼等因遭受共同痛苦、而求自新、並消除或曾使彼等受苦之一切錯誤、今日適值民國創造者之紀念日、外人作此同情之解釋、尤為適宜、蓋此足為中國處此令人恐怖之一時中之慰藉物也、</p>
<h3>壯哉二機關槍手</h3>
<p>敵人衝來擊斃百餘　退出之後人亦昏倒</p>
<p>日暉港打浦橋奉命防守之二機關槍手、當前日奉命撤退時詎彼等不願、致敵人衝來時、被該戰士搖槍斃敵百人、後至彈盡援絕、爬入法商水電公司墻內、人亦昏倒、經某西人詢問、已三日水漿不進、後送醫院救治云、</p>
<h3>楓涇鎮我調大軍反攻</h3>
<p>中央社杭州十二日電、楓涇鎮我軍防綫、十日下午被敵突破後、當晚我卽調大軍向敵反攻、激戰至十一日、敵仍圖進擾、我已派重兵堵截、</p>
<h3>六十一師李副旅長殉難</h3>
<p>陸軍六十一師一八旅副旅長李忠、字棟樑、年四十七歲、安徽合肥人、此次奉命抗戰、在淞滬前綫、屢建奇勛、尤以在愛國女校陣地浴血抗敵為最著、雖在陣地受傷、依然率部奮戰、自我軍移新陣綫後、該師在吳家厙一帶陣地、又予敵人以重創、本月三日至六日、李副旅長隨師長親上前鋒、不幸被十餘敵兵包圍、頻受機槍掃射、雖經該師三六五團李團長率援解圍、但不幸已受重傷、旋卽入賓隆醫院療治、又轉入紅十字會醫院療治、終以藥石無靈、於昨日在院殉忠、當將遺體舁入中國殯儀館、茲定今日下午一時半至二時大殮、李氏在原籍有一妻三子、身後備極簫條、而赤膽忠魂、想為各界人士所同聲一哭也、</p>

<h3>保持愛護民族的偉大精神</h3>
<p>— 金仲華</p>
<p>淞滬戰塲上的我軍，經過三個月的血戰，已於前日整軍移守第二道防綫了。這第二道防綫，乃是我們東戰塲上眞正的國防綫；今後我軍的抗戰，將比三個月來在臨時築成的防綫上的浴血苦鬥，要方便得多，而且要强烈得多。這是值得我們安慰的。然而，三個月來，我們在上海的同胞，耳聞着周圍戰綫的槍砲聲音，眼見着身活血污的受傷戰士，我們的為民族獨立解放而努力的熱烈情緒，是隨着這種直接刺激而不斷高漲着的。現在，隨着戰綫的遠移，我們的槍砲聲響，我們的英勇戰土，也漸漸地遠離我們而去。這在情緒上也許要引起許多同胞的悲憤惆悵，而這種悲憤惆悵的情緒，也就是我們愛護自己民族的深刻表現。不過，在這裹我們要勉勵上海市內的數百萬同胞的，就是單純的悲憤惆悵的情緒，是沒有用的，今後我們當以更艱毅更沉着的精神，保持並且發展我們愛護民族的偉大力量。</p>
<p>目前有一點我們需要認淸，卽至少在暫時，上海的同胞將和抗戰的前綫隔離着了。這種情形，將必然使這裹的同胞處在一種比較艱苦的生活中。眞正的抗戰消息，不易迅速傳達到；某種有形與無形的威脅，將漸慚壓緊來；而一部分只顧私利，不顧大體的人，也許將耽於眼前的逸樂，漸漸把民族獨立解放的偉大鬥爭，漸漸淡忘下去。正為了這種情形，我們更要提醒在這裹的許多同胞，努力保持愛護民族的偉大精神。</p>
<p>大家要記着，在上海周圍，我們已有鉅萬戰士流着為民族解放而鬥爭的血。有幾萬的英魂永遠存留於淞滬區域，我們不能忘記他們，因此我們更不能忘記在艱苦鬥爭中的我們民族。另一方面，在更廣大的戰綫上，我們的無數萬戰士，還是不斷和侵略者進行着鬥爭。戰鼓的聲音會遠遠地傳入我們的耳鼓的，我們全民族無數新起來的戰士的呼號，也會不斷地鼓動着我們的；只要和們咬緊牙關，沉着努力，我們雖然遠離了抗戰的前綫，却不一定是在戰綫之下。</p>
<p>抗戰初期的感情激動的時期，是過去了；今後才是運用理智沉着苦戰的時期。在我們民族解放的長期鬥爭中，我們不能希望短時期的意外的大勝利；但是只要全國一心，再接再厲，我們必能獲得最後的勝利。所以，我們應該更鄭重的相互勉勵，希望每個同胞保持愛護民族的偉大精神！</p>

<h3>尋求與國與團結民衆</h3>
<p>汪主席發表論文（續）</p>
<p>［南京］世界上沒有一個國家不注意於自己的生存的、旣注意於自已的生存、沒有不防到自己陷於孤立的、尤其沒有一家國家為自己生存的原故、不得已而與人作打時、不去尋求帮手的、蘇聯自從新經濟政策、兩次五年計劃實行以來、已漸漸成為世界上一個强國了、而其國家在地理上又處於最不怕人侵略的境遇、然而注意國交尋求與國汲汲如此、那麼聽了我們這般的高調、嚇了一跳把肩　聳起、把舌頭伸了出來、决不是虛搆的想像、此外還有一部分人士、持着一種見解、以為中國要少須把法西斯蒂的國家撇開、這也是不對的、如今世界上的國家、已不是從前的時候、會因基督敎與非基督敎而興起十字軍、因新敎與舊敎而發生混戰、所謂因主義相同而結合、其成分遠不如因利害相同來得密切、中國與此等國家之關係、以主義論、各有其政治之自由、如人選擇其最適合於自己國情之制度而加以損益期於適用、用不着彼此相强、以利害論、彼此利害並無衝突、友誼與商務關係、經濟關係、日益增進、有什麼理由將他撇開、這不是孟子所說爲淵驅魚、為叢驅雀麼、尤其是德國、他因戰敗之後、備嘗痛苦、想解除不平等的束縛、恢復平等的地位、其努力更足使我們起敬、至於其他各國、縱使和中國無甚密切關係、但於正義人道上作公正的主張、即是於世界有益，亦於中國有益、例如當國聯投票取决中日問題的時候、前此放棄投票的只有一個暹邏、此次暹邏之外、只有一個波蘭、這可見各國對於正義人道𤍠心維持、對於日本之暴行、深惡痛絕、對於中國之堅决抵抗、有深厚之同情、這些都是我們所不容忽視的、總之、中國的外交方針、旣然認定要循國際和平之路綫以前進、則凡反對侵略者、都可以爲中國之與國、中國惟有盡其在我、以博得各國之同情、進而得各國之援助、進而與各國對於侵略者加以制裁、這是中國平日應取的態度、尤其是在抗戰期間應取的態度、再說團結民衆抗戰之目的、在把垂亡的中國、挽救回來、而使之復興、欲達到此目的、惟有合四萬萬人之衆”以必死之决心、盡可能的努力、努力所在、第一自然是軍事、以四萬萬人之衆、如果加以訓練、前赴戰塲、前仆後繼、則抗戰必能持久而得最後勝利、第二是政治經濟財政敎育以至文學等等方面、不問為精神的物質的、一切都要集中起來加緊工作、再切實說一句、這些工作不但不可因抗戰而放鬆、並且要因抗戰而加緊、因爲抗戰的意義、不但在消極方面要消耗敵人的力量、尤其在積極方面、要增長我們的力量、這是抗戰能持久的基礎、也是抗敵能得到最後勝利的基礎、如此說來、抗戰不只是前方將士的事、而是全國各地民衆的事、民衆之努力與否為抗戰能否持久、能否因持久而得到最後勝利之最大關鍵、所以團結民衆、在平時固然必要、在抗戰期間尤為緊急、如今的問題、是如何纔能團結民衆呢、有人說道、歐洲大戰期間、如英如法、皆是全國民衆不分派別一致團結、無論政治上經濟上各種見解繁然各殊、只要認定國家高於一切、便能團結起來、一致努力、這種說法、在國本已定民主政治已經成功之英法等國、自然可以行得去、如果在國本正在樹立的過程中、民主政治正在開始訓練、尚未成熟的中國、今日就不能不再加以考慮了、因為在這樣風雨漂搖的今日、團結民衆不可不有一個中心、不可不以一個主義為中心、民衆有了一個主義、對於過去現在方𦆵認識得淸楚、對於將來方𦆵有了準確的方向、而把握定了、邁步前進、上頭說過抗戰不只是軍事而是遍及於政治經濟財政敎育以至文學等等方面、旣然方面如此之多、愈不能不有一個主義以為之統率了、單就軍事來說、三月以來、事實的昭示、凡是受過三民主義的訓練之軍隊、其抗戰能力必然强大、我們不必將軍隊的番號列𦦙出來、只就人人所知的南口之全團殉職、寶山乏全營殉職、以及各處戰綫的敵將士之未奉命令有死無退、便一一足以證明、綜而言之、三月以來、無日無時不是以將士的血肉、尤其是以精兵良將的血肉築成壕塹、來阻遏敵人的前進、他們為什麼有這種壯烈犧牲的精神呢、因爲平日受過三民主義的訓練、明白了民族主義上要對得起祖宗、下要對得起子孫、明白了民權主義民生主義、知道了向此前進、中國必然得到了自由平等的光明快樂、反之必將陷於奴隸、有了三民主義站在前面、引之導之、使之向前而進、所以又奮發又沉着、將一己的血肉、築成阻遏敵人侵略的一條壕塹、同時也築成了四萬萬同胞及其子孫所同走上的一條快樂的大道、我們相信每一個精兵良將、當其殺身成仁的時候、沒有不把三民主義之實現、為其最大之代價、及無上之安慰的、軍隊方面如此其他一切方面何莫不然、有了主義、𦆵有信仰、有了信仰、𦆵有精誠、有了精誠、𦆵能團結、有了圍結、𦆵有力量、有了力量纔能持久、𦆵能得到最後之勝利、故不言團結則已、言團結不可不有一個中心、不可不以主義為中心、不可不以三民主義為中心、在中國國民黨同志紅一念及三民主義之未能實現、固然引為莫大之責任、在中國同胞亦必認定在此危急存亡之際、唯有三民主義𦆵可以把民衆團結起來、所以中國共產黨最近宣言、亦切實聲明、願為三民主義之實現而奮鬥、我們如樂這樣的合四萬萬人之身、以為一身、合四萬萬人之心以爲　心、則抗戰必能持久、持久必能得到最後之勝利、是無疑的、我們今日在抗戰期間、紀念總理誕辰、覺得有無限感動、無限興奮、謹以此言爲小小貢獻、（中央社）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>上海租界問題</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>自從我軍因戰略關係。暫時從上海附近向後撤退以後。上海租界對內地的陸路交通。已經阻斷。界內市民不免對本身所受的政治上的保障。發生甚深的憂慮。因此軍委會政訓處及俞市長昨日各有懇切的文吿。昭示全市同胞。其中所說是使上海數百萬市民。得到極大的鼓勵和信念。每一市民都應當把這些話深深地銘記在心頭。</p>
<p>現在上海租界四周雖全在敵人武力控制之下。但租界以內還存在着我國各種的政府機關。而租界當局也還嚴格地維持着原有的職權。界內我國一切的主權。當然是不應發生什麽問題的。萬一有着動搖。這也就是整個租界的命運問題了。</p>
<p>我們相信武力决不能征服一切。而世界的正義和平。始終是不可抗的力量。尤其就國際關係非常複雜的上海來說。武力是决不能解决政治問題的。最近英美法三國代表在白魯塞爾商談上海租界問題。雖然內容不得而知。但這三大國一定要堅守尊重我國主權的原則。却可以斷言。因爲倘不如此。那些國家是不能維護在中國的權益的。</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>抗戰以來。已屆三月。自南市失陷。而淞滬戰局全非。現在戰局已擴展至松江靑浦楓涇石湖藻等處。我英勇的將士。還在浴血抗戰之中。回想三月以來。我人民因戰事而損失。固不可以數字計。至於戰事之成敗利鈍。尚難預料。而一般難民之流離失所。無家可歸。無衣可着。無米可餐者。奚啻數百萬。此眞當前之最嚴重最緊要之一大問題也。將無法以善其後乎。將對誰而作將伯之呼乎。我念及此。不禁心為之碎。而肝為之裂。</p>

<h3>遊擊戰與民衆組織（續）</h3>
<p>— 念慈</p>
<p>㊄堅擘淸野組鐵民衆、旣然是游擊隊的最大使命之一，那末他們所到的地方，自然要和當地的民衆有密切的連絡，以達到軍民打成一片的目的。在他們走的時候，把糧食都設法收藏起來。讓敵人來時，得不到一點吃的東西；不能入駐。</p>
<p>㊅用輕兵器前面已經說過，遊擊隊的器械，內為要運動盡便，所以大都是用步槍和機關槍等輕兵器的。他們沒有甚麼輜重兵，而且又要東奔西走，至多也祇耍幾尊小鋼砲和迫擊砲了。用槍也沒有一定的種類，不夠完全要和敵人的一樣為原同則•一日截擭敵人的子彈，裝上槍就可以應用。</p>
<p>㊆行蹤秘密在遊擊隊出發的時候，那目的地，往住除了長官之外，其餘的隊員，一個都不知道，大家祇顧跟着領導往前走等到了目的地之後，大家方才明白要到的地方。</p>
<p>㊇化整為零遊擊隊員在沒有任務的時候，不是大家聚在一起的。因為各人都有工作的能力，沒有事就各人分散到四方去，但在分散的時候，就到預先約定，在某一個時候，大家一定要凖時集齊，所以在集合的時候，是很迅速的、而且不必召集了。</p>
<p>遊擊隊的任務</p>
<p>一組織民衆　游擊隊到了一個地方，第一步的工作，就是把隊員分配出去，做組織民衆的工作。因為他們的糧食問題和地理問題，都需要民衆給他們解决的。</p>
<p>二破壞敵人的交通　他們知道了敵人要由某處到某處或者運輸的路錢時，便立刻派人去把某一段的交通設法破壞•使敵人增援斷絕，且又有斷食之虞，而失去戰鬥力。</p>
<p>三牽制敵人的兵力　當敵人正在向某處進攻時，他們立刻到敵人的後面去進襲，或是由左右兩路作側擊，使敵人腹背受敵。</p>
<p>四勞敵　探知了敵人駐紮所在，馬上前去進攻，等他們回擊的時候，又立卽退走，再由別路抄到另一面去襲擊。如此反復不停，使敵人疲於奔命，而又捉摸不到他們的主力何在，徒然消耗許多彈藥和實力；結果還是一無所得。</p>
<p>五餓敵　遊擊隊經過的地方，就把糧食都深藏起來，不給敵人吃，並月敵入自己所帶的食糧也常受他們的刦掠。甚至於連裹都下了毒藥，水也不讓敵人喝一點，逼得敵人不得不立卽退走。</p>
<p>游擊隊員必具的條件</p>
<p>游擊隊員的生活是非常刻苦的，雖然沒有甚麼嚴謹的條件。但每一個隊員是必須具有的。</p>
<p>㊀能走路　一天走二三百里路不算一回事。</p>
<p>㊁能耐勞　今天有糧食，大家多吃點，如果沒有，就一二天不吃也不要緊。</p>
<p>㊂熟識地理　每到一處地方，非得要深刻明瞭那地方的路徑和險隘不可</p>
<p>㊃槍法要絕對凖確　游擊隊的人數不過多，自然不能運帶大批的彈械了：對於子彈是很愛惜的，决不肯胡亂放一搶。並且在射擊的時候，專要射中敵人的軍官為原則，因為一枝軍隊裹面沒有長官，他的實力是要受到相當損失的。所以槍法是非要絕對準確不可。</p>
<p>㊄能夠深入民間　因為游擊隊是要和民樂有連絡，所以每一個隊員都要具有深入民間的能力。</p>
<p>㊅無槍也要戰　有時他們發現了敵人，卽使手裹沒有槍，也要支持下去。一方面再設法奪取敵人的槍械。</p>
<p>敵軍類別</p>
<p>我們的敵入—日本軍隊，假使要知道他是屬於那一類的，祇看他們的領章就行了，現在把他分述於次：</p>
<p>A步兵　紅領章</p>
<p>B砲兵　黃領章</p>
<p>C騎兵　深藍領章</p>
<p>D工兵　紫領章</p>
<p>B輜重兵　白領章</p>
<p>如果要知道人數多寡，祇看旗號就知道了。他們一個“中隊和我國軍隊二連”人差不多，一個“大隊”等於二營一人，一、個“聯隊”等於團人左右。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>游擊隊員，除了他們自己本身的條件之外，更須希望民衆有組織的幫肋，而能達到以少勝多，以逸待勞，隨地作戰，到處破壞的功效。他們的作戰，完全是居於主動地位的，並不作佔領土地的奢望。這種戰術，在被侵略的弱小國家，最為切用，因為懦弱的國家，隨時隨地都有被侵略的可能性，而本身又沒有充分的力量和軍備，一旦遭到列强的侵路，無法抵抗，衹有利用游擊戰來逐步消㓕敵人的整個力量；使他失去侵略的能力和野心。此外，我們還可以把養成將來龐大的軍隊為原則，我們被目為一盤散沙的民衆，也不難因此團結起來的。（完）</p>
<h3>中華的小英雄</h3>
<p>— 劉育才</p>
<p>在這一次上海的戰爭中，中國大多數的國民，都表現出他們眞誠的高貴價值！</p>
<p>戰雲和騷動震盪着這個大都市，戰區難民的救濟，以及糧食的供給和其他一切戰時問題，這是足夠了上海的政府當局忙於應付；在這時候就有許多急公好義的人民，正以他們的忠心努力為國家人羣盡最偉大的服役。這樣壯烈義勇的精神！在戰事爆發後到現在，我們隨時都能耳聞目見；但是另有一大羣的少年人，他們可佩的樸實的智勇兼備的英武精神！已確切地為一般人們所深切的認識和贊揚。</p>
<p>可敬佩的英雄</p>
<p>從這一次中日戰事爆發以後，一千五百餘名的少年兵就立卽動員，是為其祖國而服務；這一大羣的少年兵，就是曾為他們祖國的被敵侵略而盡過無數次寶貴職務的中國童子軍！他們大多數的年紀都祇有十六歲左右，從戰事爆發起，他們便把全部的光陰和實力都貢獻給危難的祖國。</p>
<p>他們的工作，經常地出入於可怕的矗炸地帶，在那些已遭炸毀過的區域裹，隨時可看見他們的踪影，他們憑着少年人固有的堅强意識，在大多數上了年紀的人所最怯懦的情境之下進行他們的任務；在每次羣衆被轟炸的慘劇發生時，總有這一輩少年在那裹，不論是已死的人或將死的人，祇要他們的目力所及，是責無旁貸地加以救護去，從這點上看來，我們可以想像到這輩少年童子軍的熱血高漲和愛國底感情是多麼勇壯啊！這裏我們還須記着，他們都是年未及冠的少年哩！</p>
<p>工作是義務的</p>
<p>他們忠勇愛國的情緒，十分緊張而嚴肅，似乎可說再沒有甚於此了；他們的集團中有三分之一的工作是分派在各個傷兵醫院服務；每天的工作時間，往往超過了十二小時，在其他方面服務的弟兄，其工作情形也一樣地緊張着！因為實際情形的需要起見，他們都是住宿於服務的所在地；童子軍團本部從上級領到的經費，是完全用之於堅要的工作上面，民衆們如有所捐贈的物品，他們都用之於救濟方面的；就是他們的制服，也完全由自已出錢製備的，他們是確切地涓滴歸公，而自己不受分文。</p>
<p>童子軍的助人</p>
<p>上海的中國民衆在敵愾同仇的憤懣之下，若是聽到街市上喊一聲“打漢奸”的時候，往往有些人是會冤屈波及的，童子軍見到可疑的羣情之中，就能機警的加以排解援助無辜的民衆，始得免於侮辱與毒打；有的商議會趁火打刦，故意把日常的主要食品，抬高價格，因而又會引起羣衆的憤懣而攻打商舖，童子軍見到這種情形，必加以追究事實的眞相後，送與主管處處理，而很多的商舖員，幸賴童子軍的調處，得免毆打。還有無數流離失所的戰區難民，而得到路費歸還鄕里，這也得感謝於這輩童子軍的帮助的，因為童子軍能夠設法把他們運送到安全地方。更有許多難民的家庭，遭受了戰事而一家流散，童子軍往往有機會碰見到而帮助使之團聚;另一方面，童子軍更為着前錢所需要的物品，而挨戶徵募，同時又担任了火綫中往返的其他重要工作。</p>
<p>第一個新的殉難者</p>
<p>童子軍的弟兄，他們都高興地想去火錢上服務，可是他們的軍事學織和年齡的太小，尚不足担任此種工作;在一二八戰役時期的上海童子軍，他們會給軍隊做了不少偉大的工作，始設置電話，管理交通，裝修通話錢，又曾帮助修復蘇州的城牆，和堆置沙包等防禦工程，並建築了一條從崑山到蘇州長綫二十公哩的軍路；當軍隊要調動的時候，童子軍更忙着一切助理的工作，有一個時期，他們也掮起了槍來同軍隊一處作戰！</p>
<p>又在各處災害存留的地方，這輩小英雄，都會派到那裏去工作，當他們在虞洽卿路和愛多亞路等處救肋難民的時候，他們中間有一個弟兄是作了大世界前慘劇的犧牲者；　個可敬佩的中華小英雄，他是中國第一個新的殉難者；</p>

        <h1>1937.11.13</h1>
<h3>Shanghai Falls Completely Amidst Wind and Rain Yesterday</h3>
<p>Remaining Soldiers and Police Make a Final Sacrifice</p>
<p>The soldiers and police ordered to defend Nanshi resisted fiercely amidst the enemy's intense artillery fire. However, by 11:00 PM the night before last, their defenses were destroyed, leaving them with nothing to rely on. They were then ordered to retreat. However, yesterday, a unit of soldiers and police still fought to the death under the enemy's encirclement. Amidst the dismal wind and rain, sporadic gunfire could be heard. By around 4:00 PM, the gunfire ceased, and our great Shanghai had completely fallen into enemy hands. According to a reporter, the tragic details of the fall of Nanshi are recorded below as the final report on the fall of Shanghai. The enemy launched a general attack on Nanshi starting at noon on the 10th, concentrating bombing with twenty to thirty aircraft and naval and land artillery. Enemy troops also continued to advance. By around 2:00 PM on the 11th, the artillery fire had not stopped. The Zhang Brigade of the 55th Division, defending the first line of defense, endured the fierce artillery fire for more than twenty hours. However, due to the destruction of their defenses and heavy casualties, they were breached by the enemy. The entire line of our army was shortened from thirty-five li to fifteen li, the defensive position becoming increasingly cramped and the situation becoming critical. After receiving the alert, we immediately ordered the soldiers and police defending the Bund area of ​​the 16th Section to rush to the area of Jumen Road to reinforce the second line of defense at Lujiabang Road. After the enemy crossed the Rihui Port, they immediately used five tanks as a vanguard, covering a large group of infantry, which surged forward like a tide. Zhong Yang, the captain of our police squadron, personally led the police officers to defend Jumen Road, Huining Road, and other places to fight. Although the strength was disparate, they still responded bravely. Captain Zhong died in battle, and the enemy broke through, heading straight for the city. At that time, the enemy also bombarded our riverside positions with artillery, and used rubber boats to carry enemy troops to attack. Officials and police from the 16th Section and the Ximen Branch rushed to assist in the battle. However, two of the local defense works were destroyed by enemy artillery fire, and all the officers and police made heroic sacrifices. However, a solitary unit still fought to the death amidst the enemy's three-sided encirclement. The bloodiest battle was fought from 5:00 AM to 8:00 AM, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. They then received an order, and by 11:00 PM, they began an orderly retreat. However, there was still a team of soldiers and police who, disregarding the retreat, firmly sought to achieve their goal of martyrdom. They held out until 4:00 PM yesterday, and many sacrificed their lives.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Fight Hard in Yanpu</h3>
<p>Zhang Brigade and the Police Headquarters, who steadfastly defended the last position in Nanshi, fought hard under enemy artillery fire and rain of bullets. They were eventually ordered to retreat the day before yesterday due to the destruction of the defense works and the lack of water and food. Most of the troops had retreated late at night, but a unit stationed south of the Wai Malu Customs Bridge and the municipal warehouses and Ning Shao godowns along the riverbank, because they had not received orders, still calmly resisted in the midst of the enemy's heavy encirclement, vowing to use their last drop of blood to fulfill their duty of defending the country. The enemy artillery fire continued all night, but their infantry did not rush in. Yesterday morning, several enemy rubber boats sailed from the Huangpu River towards that area, but after our army swept them with machine guns, they fled. Our army held out until yesterday afternoon and retreated in the direction of safe locations.</p>
<h3>Heroic Enemy Killing Near Bansongyuan</h3>
<p>In the area south of Lujiabang Road in Nanshi, east of Chezhan Road, and near Bansongyuan on the banks of the Huangpu River, another unit of our defending troops, about several hundred people, continued to fight hard against the enemy yesterday because they had not received orders. Since the night before last, our troops there had been heavily surrounded by the enemy on three sides. In addition to using heavy artillery to bombard fiercely, the enemy also used armored vehicles as cover and charged our defending troops several times. However, because our batch of defending troops were determined to coexist with the position and were determined to demand a considerable price from the enemy, they occupied various high-rise buildings and densely swept the enemy with machine guns. After fierce fighting until the afternoon, our defending troops retreated in the direction of the rear.</p>
<h3>Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha Fall Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Nanhui Bridge Suffers the Greatest Losses</p>
<p>The three counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha had all fallen by yesterday. According to a report from a gentleman from Fengxian who escaped to Shanghai yesterday morning, the enemy's vanguard troops were all reorganized puppet troops, wearing black uniforms, and there were also those wearing plain clothes and large hats and carrying pistols. Upon arrival, they did not allow the people to evacuate, ordered guides, and searched everywhere. Anyone who was suspicious or whose answers were unclear was imprisoned. The enemy's formal troops were all wearing yellow uniforms, with gold threads on the edges of their hats. They came from Shengzimiao, Zhuangxing, Tuolin, Xinxishi, and other places, and the checkpoints at each key point were very strict. When a certain gentleman passed near Nanhui Bridge, he suddenly encountered enemy troops, who shouted to ask his profession. After he stepped forward to explain, a plainclothes agent speaking with a Taizhou accent explained and he paid a price of four yuan to get a pass to escape the disaster. As for the extent of local losses, Nanhui Bridge suffered the most. Fengcheng and Nangaobridge, among other places, have been bombarded by enemy ships and bombed by enemy aircraft in recent days and have been reduced to scorched earth. According to a certain flower factory scout in Dongxiang Qingcungang and other places, there is little disturbance locally, and small shops are still trading, because no traces of the enemy have been found so far. The Nanhui area also fell at the same time before the 12th. There are also rumors outside that a puppet organization and maintenance association has been found in Chuansha County, but the accuracy of this remains to be verified. There are more refugees fleeing to Shanghai from Nanhui, followed by Fengxian, and the least from Chuansha. Currently, Jiang Zhuoyun of Nanhui and others are working with the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association to find ways to provide relief. Yesterday, Fengxian held a meeting at the Paradise in this city to set up a registration office for refugees staying in Shanghai to conduct a preliminary investigation.</p>
<h3>The Total Number of Enemy Troops in Pudong Exceeds 10,000</h3>
<p>Most of Them Head to Southern Pudong</p>
<p>Since the enemy's vanguard troops occupied Pudong the day before yesterday morning, reinforcements have continued to arrive, reaching more than 10,000 people. Half of them are Manchurian soldiers who are tall and speak Mandarin. Among every three people, there must be an enemy soldier monitoring them, carrying a large number of baggage and military equipment. They passed through Zhoupu yesterday morning and headed towards the southern border of Fengxian County, so that they could contact the enemy troops who landed at Jinshanwei and invaded Songjiang, and invade the area along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road.</p>
<h3>Details of the Bombing of Pinghu and Zhapu</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Near Dushan</p>
<p>According to Mr. Dai Tongqiu, the person in charge of the Pinghu Fellow Villagers Association, the news of the bombing of Pinghu and Zhapu is as follows: (This news was narrated by fellow villagers who escaped from Pinghu) On the 3rd of this month, we received alerts from Jinshanwei, Xincang, and other places. Some shops closed. On the 4th, five or six enemy planes scouted the urban area from morning to night all day long. The civilians fled to the outside of the West Gate and North Gate. The enemy planes did not drop bombs. Starting at 3:00 PM on the 5th, enemy planes began to bomb from outside the South Gate and the urban area, dropping more than 30 bombs. The post office, the telephone office, Wang Gongchang, Wang Xianghe, and the large and small streets were all destroyed. Other areas are not known because they were not witnessed. As for Zhapu, according to the members of Runyu Society who escaped from Zhapu, the Zhapu South Gate Railway Station, the Dawang Temple, the Yinglong Bridge, and nearby houses were all bombed. The Sanshan Guild Hall, the Central Elementary School, the Xu Family Ancestral Hall, and the West Gate Street and the North Gate Suspension Bridge in the city were also bombed on the 4th, causing many deaths and injuries. In addition, the association received a reliable report yesterday that Pinghu and Zhapu are still being defended by our army. However, there is fierce fighting near Dushan, nine li east of Zhapu. Dushan has nine peaks that stand tall on the coast. It will be difficult for the enemy to advance if they try to cross the mountain and invade Zhapu.</p>
<h3>After Abandoning Nanshi and Pudong, We Now Defend New Positions</h3>
<p>Guangfu and Huangdu Defenses are Solid; Qingpu and Songjiang are Still in Our Hands</p>
<p>Reuters, Nanjing, 12th Central News Agency: According to news from Chinese sources here, after abandoning Pudong and Nanshi, the Chinese army is now defending new positions, with Songjiang on the right flank, Huangdu in the center, and Guangfu on the left flank. The Chinese army is currently fighting the Japanese army that landed in Hangzhou Bay near Sijing. The second line of defense is set up in Qingpu and Songjiang, which are still in the hands of the Chinese army. At the same time, a phone call from Ningbo here said that the Japanese army's landing in Guanhaiwei is not accurate. However, Japanese warships are very active near Haiyan.</p>
<h3>Three Brave Soldiers Defending Luzhai are Wounded but Repel the Enemy</h3>
<p>The Military Affairs Commission Gives Special Bonuses and Two Ranks</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A battalion of our □□ Division, defending Luzhai, fought bravely in the battle on October 3, making many heroic sacrifices. In the end, only three soldiers, Geng Wanyou, Chen Wancheng, and Liu Liuer, remained. They continued to resist, and although wounded, they did not retreat, maintaining their position and waiting for reinforcements, repelling the enemy. Their resolute and brave spirit is truly commendable. The Military Affairs Commission has specially awarded each soldier a bonus of 200 yuan and promoted them each two ranks, and will also submit the case for discussion and commendation to show encouragement.</p>
<h3>The North China Daily News Publishes an Article Commiserating with Our Fellow Shanghai Compatriots</h3>
<p>Success or Failure Still Depends on the Future; Seeking Self-Renewal Through Pain; Massacre and Destruction Cannot Harm Our National Soul</p>
<p>The North China Daily News published an editorial yesterday, saying: "The god of war who devastated the center of Shanghai has left this place and gone far away, but Shanghai must still be troubled by it and cannot escape the pressure exerted by the iron hoops that make the god of war go far away." The Chinese army's defense of the surrounding defense lines of Shanghai was initially thought to be no more than two or three weeks. Now that it has retreated, the general Chinese people cannot help but be frustrated. They may be encouraged by the bravery of their defense and because the soldiers fought to make the enemy's advance pay a high price. However, when the war outside Shanghai is still unfolding and success or failure still depends on the future, returning to the silence of a neutral attitude, the feelings they receive, all the people of various countries who are in the same situation, should express sympathy and respect to them. Although expressing sympathy in this kind of event does little good, the Chinese people should know that a large part of the foreigners here and elsewhere in China are deeply saddened by the difficulties faced by the Chinese people and deeply sympathize with the sacrifices they have made in resisting foreign aggression. The more than 3 million Chinese people in the world's sixth largest city, in this great national crisis, when temporarily cut off from direct and unconstrained contact with their government and country, maintaining political mortification is not to be criticized. An ounce of sincerity and understanding is worth a ton of advice and admonition. It may not be inappropriate to give spiritual encouragement to the tenacity and restraint required to adopt national dignity.</p>
<p>Shanghai as a whole, of course, regards the current change in the situation as a sign of its own difficulties entering another scene. Although the severity of the war panic is about to disappear, this kind of difficulty does not seem to be alleviated as a result. What is needed now is the development of civic cooperation, but this kind of cooperation often puts individuals and groups in a dilemma. In this kind of situation, foreigners should recognize that they have an obligation to adjust their daily lives to suit reality. Some people may think that the disaster in Shanghai is indeed due to the Chinese government's decision to use Shanghai as the main location to resist Japanese aggression because some people have suffered. To determine this matter, use wisdom to make good use of theory and facts. Ordinary people often make superficial legal estimates of the course of events. The Japanese claim that the drama in Shanghai was caused by the Chinese government's stubbornness and violation of treaties. This statement should not be taken lightly. This kind of thinking may mislead foreigners' opinions, so we should reiterate some broad reasons today. Japan's actions in North China actually forced the Chinese government and its people to choose between admitting to continuing to swallow its land and endangering the integrity of its country, and painfully resisting overwhelming force. Japan cannot think that it has the right to condemn the consequences of this choice. This is the most difficult point in the Shanghai issue today. The emotional impact on foreigners is certainly even greater, because the war between the two major countries, although not planned, has unfortunately damaged the huge interests of neutral countries on which Shanghai's economic security depends. Although this point cannot be accurately explained at present, it should not be ignored. In the foreseeable future, the misfortune suffered by those who are not third-party profiteers, that is, the many dangers that Japanese groups are forced to face to their lives and property, the final solution of such a major crisis in Shanghai affairs (although this matter may be a greater dispute between China and Japan, there are still just people who will propose to consider it.</p>
<p>Those who hold the view that the war should be limited to North China are actually trying to advocate the theory that China should choose another place outside the battlefield suitable for Japan to fight against Japan, which is not without blame. Shanghai does seem to have the Songhu Agreement of May 1932 as a refuge. It should be known that the agreement was not signed by both parties and was a temporary measure. Now it cannot accept China's destruction of the agreement and prepare for self-defense to resist Japan's policy in the area and elsewhere, which is obviously possible. This kind of criticism is entirely based on the inextricable entanglement of facts and fantasies. It is also not possible to explain in detail the topic of constant development, that is, the destruction of the agreement is not exclusively done by any one party. It is necessary to declare that China, when it encounters an armed attack on its sovereignty, examines all the circumstances, and it is perfectly justifiable to strike at the place where it believes it can inflict a powerful blow, even a destructive blow, on the aggressor. As for whether it has made appropriate considerations when it makes appropriate considerations for the fact that fighting in this big city will cause major losses, future commentators will have to decide. This point cannot be judged arbitrarily until the final outcome of the full-scale war from Guangzhou to Beiping is clear. Shanghai today urgently needs to consolidate itself to endure the major economic, political and social difficulties, and worry and pessimism fill the entire city. Shanghai is now being successfully besieged by the attacking army, but it should be remembered that outside this steel ring and outside the capital of Nanjing, there are groups of great fluctuations in Chinese humanity and Chinese courage. No matter how serious the disaster seems to have caused great corruption, and there is a concrete and practical existence, this is actually China's last restoration and liberation from foreign yokes. In the foreseeable future, China's major needs will inevitably be re-invested in this city and port, and will be responsible for helping it prosper and proving Shanghai's future as a commercial and financial aid to China's progress. This can be guaranteed for Shanghai. Furthermore, in terms of spirit, the facts are ironclad. Massacre and destruction can never harm the soul of this great nation, and will instead make them seek self-renewal by suffering common pain and eliminating all the mistakes that may have caused them to suffer. Today is the anniversary of the creators of the Republic of China, and it is especially appropriate for foreigners to make this sympathetic interpretation, because this is enough to be a comfort to China in this terrifying moment.</p>
<h3>How Brave are the Two Machine Gunners!</h3>
<p>The enemy charged and they killed more than a hundred; after retreating, they also collapsed</p>
<p>The two machine gunners who were ordered to defend Rihui Port and Dapu Bridge were ordered to retreat the day before yesterday, but they were unwilling. When the enemy charged, the warriors shook their guns and killed a hundred enemies. Later, when the ammunition ran out, they climbed into the wall of the French-owned Water and Electricity Company, and they also collapsed. After a Westerner asked, they had not eaten or drunk for three days, and were later sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>We Mobilize a Large Army to Counterattack Fengjing Town</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 12th: After our army's defense line in Fengjing Town was broken by the enemy on the afternoon of the 10th, we immediately mobilized a large army to counterattack the enemy that night. After fierce fighting until the 11th, the enemy still tried to invade. We have sent heavy troops to block them.</p>
<h3>Deputy Brigade Commander Li of the 61st Division Dies</h3>
<p>Li Zhong, Deputy Brigade Commander of the 18th Brigade of the 61st Division of the Army, whose style name was Dongliang, was 47 years old and a native of Hefei, Anhui. This time, he was ordered to resist the war and made many outstanding achievements on the Shanghai front line, especially his bloody battle against the enemy at the Patriotic Girls' School position. Although he was wounded at the position, he still led his troops to fight bravely. After our army moved to a new front line, the division inflicted heavy damage on the enemy in the area around Wujiaju. From the 3rd to the 6th of this month, Deputy Brigade Commander Li accompanied the division commander to the front line. Unfortunately, he was surrounded by more than ten enemy soldiers and was frequently strafed by machine guns. Although Regiment Commander Li of the 365th Regiment of the division led reinforcements to break the siege, he was unfortunately seriously injured and was immediately admitted to Binlong Hospital for treatment. He was then transferred to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but eventually died in the hospital yesterday. His body was carried into the Chinese Funeral Home and the funeral will be held today at 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM. Mr. Li has a wife and three sons in his hometown, and his funeral is extremely desolate, but his loyalty is something that people from all walks of life want to cry for together.</p>

<h3>British Officials Firmly Deny Rumors of British Military Actions in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Reuters, Shanghai, 12th Central News Agency: Reuters is now instructed by responsible parties to declare that the rumors circulating in Shanghai that the British Navy and Army stationed in Shanghai have been authorized by the government to open fire on Japan immediately if it attacks the Public Concession south of the Suzhou Creek are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 12th Central News Agency: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today published an article issued by the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, which firmly denied the rumors spread by a certain foreign news agency that the British Navy and Army stationed in Shanghai had been ordered to open fire on the Japanese army if it attempted to enter the south bank of the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Trying to Establish a Blockade are Damaged</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that at about 11:00 AM yesterday (the 11th), a small Japanese steamer carrying a team of soldiers tried to climb onto a merchant ship sunk in the river at the Huangpu River blockade in the 16th Section, with ladders placed on the side of the ship, and distributed rifles and machine guns in various mouths. At that time, rifles and light machine gun bullets rained down from the pier, obviously without hitting. The small steamer left the blockade and sailed downstream. Before sailing a few yards, a heavy machine gun on the riverbank in Nanshi suddenly fired, and the distance was very close. The bullets seemed to have penetrated the steel plate and broken its boiler. Suddenly, steam came out like clouds, and the bullets continued to pour in from head to tail, riddled with bullets. Two Japanese soldiers jumped into the river and were rescued by a Japanese Navy dinghy. The warship floated with the waves, and the soldiers in the ship were either dead or injured. Later, another small steamer towed it downstream. It passed in front of various foreign warships. In the afternoon, the blockade was set on fire by Japanese soldiers pouring oil on it. A sand ship caught fire and floated in the river, almost engulfing an oil tanker and two Japanese gunboats. Later, the fireboat Puji arrived and extinguished the fire on the two sand ships.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Transported Another Large Batch of Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Another 5,000 Reinforcements Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday, another enemy transport ship No. ○3○, the merchant ship-rebuilt transport ship No. 127 Binjiang Maru, and the transport ship No. 384 Nikko Maru arrived in Shanghai, docking at the Huangpu and Osaka docks, carrying countless enemy trucks, armored vehicles, war horses, and ammunition. In addition, the enemy warship Najima arrived at the Xinhuaishan Pier in Pudong yesterday, unloading a large number of military trucks, war horses, machines, bicycles, and other military supplies. Yesterday, another enemy merchant ship-rebuilt transport ship No. 140 Aioi Maru, transport ship No. 70 Tenyo Maru, and Shanghai Maru (Ienoa Maru) and four other ships arrived in Shanghai, carrying the fourth batch of enemy seventh reinforcements, totaling about 5,000 people, landing at the Huangpu Dock, Osaka Dock, and Huishan Dock. In total, the enemy reinforcements have reached more than 20,000 in the past five days.</p>
<h3>The British Press Mourns the Death of Stephens</h3>
<p>The Japanese Ambassador to the UK Sends a Letter to the Daily Mail Expressing Regret and Personal Sympathy</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th Central News Agency: The Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Yoshitada Tokugawa, recently sent a letter to Lord Camrose, the editor-in-chief of the Daily Mail, expressing his great regret for the death of Stevens, the newspaper's reporter stationed in Shanghai, and his personal sympathy. The newspaper also published an article in memory of Mr. Stephens, saying that war correspondents like Mr. Stephens never put themselves first in the battlefields they described. Only his close friends knew about Mr. Stephens' many adventures. However, the records of these adventures, no matter how lightly written, show that Mr. Stephens had long been fearless in the face of danger. It is unfortunate that such a special and beloved person died prematurely, and all his friends mourned him. The London press has scheduled a memorial service for Mr. Stephens on November 17 at the Seamen's Church in Fleet Street.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Shanghai Municipal Party Department to Compatriots Across the Country</h3>
<p>The War of Total Resistance Will Not Stop for a Day; Relief Work Will Not Stop for a Day</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang published a letter to compatriots across the country yesterday, saying: "Dear compatriots across the country, everyone knows that the Shanghai War of Resistance is one aspect of the war of total resistance and one stage of the long-term war of resistance. It can even be said that the Shanghai War of Resistance is only the beginning of the war of total resistance and the long-term war of resistance, and is by no means its end. Looking back on the past three months, thanks to the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers at the front to kill the enemy and their heroic sacrifices, as well as the generous contributions and enthusiastic service of the entire city's people, the enemy has poured all their naval, land, and air forces, reinforced five times, and launched six general attacks, consuming a large amount of their combat power. Our heroic national army, although withdrawing from Shanghai due to strategic relations, can be said to have completed its mission quite well. Therefore, the withdrawal of our army from Shanghai cannot be regarded as a failure of our army's operations, nor can it be regarded as the end of the Shanghai war, and especially cannot be regarded as the final outcome of the war of total resistance. Only in this way, compatriots in the entire city of Shanghai and even compatriots across the country must not be shaken by the theories of traitors, and must clearly recognize that the tasks of the people in the future to resist the war will be more difficult and more great. We must persevere and move forward without retreating to overcome difficulties. Not only do displaced refugees need our relief everywhere, but also soldiers with broken arms and legs need our care, the families of martyrs need our education, the teams that charge into battle need our replenishment, the people who carry food and drink need our organization, the lifeless hinterland needs our propaganda, the skills to save the dying and heal the wounded need our training, the demons and ghosts of traitors need our sanctions, and even education and industry in times of emergency need our promotion and development, and the evolution and connection of the international situation needs our research and efforts... and so on. The war of total resistance will not stop for a day, that is, the work of our compatriots across the country to support the war of resistance will not stop for a day. We must not think that the Shanghai War of Resistance is over, and that we only need to do some post-disaster work and manage relief. If this is the case, then traitors like Jiang Chaozong will naturally pretend to be charitable and ingratiate themselves with the enemy. How can this be what all of us who are determined to resist the war expect? Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said, "Our determination to defend ourselves has always been consistent. Even if there is only the last soldier left and the last inch of territory, we will not change our original intention." We, the comrades in the entire city and the compatriots across the country, encourage each other to never stop until we achieve the final victory."</p>
<h3>A Refugee Describes the Tragic Situation in the Southwest Countryside after Three Escapes from Death</h3>
<p>Corpses Lying Everywhere Along the Shanghai-Minhang Road, Furniture and Farming Tools Looted</p>
<p>The southwestern countryside of this city, such as Longhua, Caohejing, Zhujiahang, Changqiao, Wujiabang, Meilong, and Qianliangmiao at the intersection of the city and county, etc., were successively occupied by enemy troops in the afternoon after our army withdrew from the positions on the south bank of the Suzhou River. Many farmers hesitated to leave because they could not bear to part with the crops in the fields and their property. Zhang Amao, a villager who recently escaped from the enemy's guns in western Shanghai after three narrow escapes, recounted the actual situation he witnessed as follows: Zhang Amao's ancestral home is Taojiatang, west of Caohejing Town. Because he did not know in advance that our army had already withdrawn, the residents of the house went to the nearby teahouse for tea as usual. On the afternoon of the 9th, the enemy troops arrived and fired machine guns in all directions. More than a dozen tea drinkers in the teahouse fell to the ground after being shot (all of them were residents of the Zhang family in Taojiatang). He knew that things were not good, so he immediately fell to the ground and fled east. At that time, thick smoke covered the sky in the southeast corner, and flames were soaring. He then took a small road to the Shanghai-Minhang Road and went south to Qianliangmiao. It was already dark when he was caught by an enemy sentry. They wanted to shoot him, but after repeated pleas, he was spared, but he was not allowed to go south. So he went north along the Shanghai-Minhang Road. Corpses were lying everywhere along the way, and there were many destroyed vehicles. Passing Shanghai Middle School in Wujiabang, he saw that enemy troops were stationed there. Later, because he was hungry and tired, he sat down to rest in front of the Huiling Bus Station. Unexpectedly, he was seen by the enemy troops in the school across the street, who suspected that he was a plainclothes soldier of our army. He was arrested again and sent to the enemy headquarters of Guanshengyuan in the whole Caohejing Town. There were already seven or eight people detained inside. Later, he took the opportunity to escape and saw that Yangjiagang had been reduced to scorched earth, with several corpses lying in the fields. There were also two or three female corpses on the ground at the east town entrance. Chen Yuanhe and other shops in the central market were burning fiercely. The residence of Yang Xinzheng, the municipal party committee member, was completely emptied. Several freight cars were parked at the town entrance, and the streets were filled with utensils and farm implements. Therefore, the losses in the town were very heavy. The houses on both sides of the lower building were destroyed by armored vehicles. Later, he went to Houshangbang and took a small road behind Xiqin Institute. When he reached Jinjianong, he was stopped by two enemy soldiers who opened fire at him. He fell to the ground in panic and fainted for a long time before he woke up. Fortunately, he was not injured and finally arrived at Xujiahui and escaped to Shanghai. Thinking of running for two days and three nights, and escaping from death three times, he couldn't help but feel terrified. In total, he saw no less than dozens of corpses along the way.</p>

<h3>The Second Invitation to the Beijing Conference is Rejected Again by Japan</h3>
<p>Insisting on Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations, Arrogant Attitude Disregarding Justice, No Different from Slapping the Great Powers in the Face</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japan has now declined the second invitation from Belgium to send representatives to the Beijing Conference. The reply has been approved by the cabinet and, after being approved by the Emperor this afternoon, will be delivered to the Belgian ambassador to Japan and telegraphed to the Japanese ambassador to Belgium. The Japanese government intends to publish an article at the same time to explain Japan's fundamental policy on the Sino-Japanese conflict. (Central News Agency, December Reuters)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After several hours of discussion and drafting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs finally decided not to publish an explanatory statement on Japan's reply to Belgium. (Central News Agency, December 12, Reuters)</p>
<p>Brussels The Japanese government has recently rejected the second invitation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and refused to attend the conference. Regarding this, Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, recently issued a statement to Havas, stating, "The Japanese government's attitude is arrogant, rude, and lacks sympathy. The representatives of the countries at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have a very moderate and compromising spirit, and even make concessions to seek perfection. Now Japan actually despises them. This is tantamount to slapping the entire Nine-Power Treaty Conference in the face. The Japanese government still values power and disregards justice, which can be seen here." (Central News Agency, December 12, Havas)</p>
<h3>Outline of Tokyo's Reply</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding Japan's reply to Belgium's second invitation to send representatives to the Nine-Power Conference, it stated that the Japanese government cannot accept the invitation to participate in a conference convened under the Nine-Power Treaty after being condemned for violating the terms of the Nine-Power Treaty. The reply stated that the letter of November 7 has been received and the opinions of the participating countries stated in the letter have been learned. As a result of careful consideration, it is felt that these opinions are not sufficient to make the Japanese government change its views and policies that have been clearly expressed in the first reply on October 27 and the public declaration on the same day. The Japanese government has always believed that Japan's current actions in China are self-defense actions taken by Japan following China's provocative actions. Therefore, it is not within the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty, and it is believed that there is no room to discuss the issue of applying the Nine-Power Treaty. Since the current incident originated in the special situation in East Asia, the most appropriate and fair solution can be obtained through direct negotiations between the two parties directly concerned. As for the attempt to negotiate in a collective institutional structure such as the Beijing Conference, it will only arouse the emotions of the people of the two countries and hinder the satisfactory resolution of this matter. This is the Japanese government's firm belief. If all countries fully understand the above views and help promote the stability of East Asia in a manner that suits the actual situation, the Japanese government will be happy to do so. Regarding the statement by the participating countries that all countries related to the Far East are affected by the current hostile actions, and the whole world is concerned about the repercussions of these hostile actions on the peace and security of all countries, the Japanese government now wishes to state that Japan is now doing its best to respect foreign rights and interests in China and has the deepest concern to establish peace with the satisfactory outcome of the current incident. Japan has clearly revealed all this in its repeated declarations. (Central News Agency, December 12, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Representatives Decide to Cancel the Final Application to Japan</h3>
<p>Brussels After the outline of the Japanese reply was transmitted here, it caused a deep impression. British Foreign Secretary Eden immediately discussed it with the representatives of the countries attending the Nine-Power Conference. Public opinion is that since the wording of the Japanese reply is so firm, it would be superfluous to request Japan again. Therefore, the plan to issue the last application has been cancelled. It is heard that tomorrow's meeting will consider preparing a draft of the entire situation statement. An informal meeting will be held tomorrow morning, and a public meeting will be held in the afternoon. Another informal meeting will be held on Monday to pass the statement, and then this statement will be sent to Japan as one of the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty. There is currently no certainty about future progress. The official original text of the Japanese reply has not yet arrived. (Central News Agency, December 12, Reuters)</p>

<p>Brussels Japan has now replied that it refuses to accept the second invitation issued by Belgium to attend the Nine-Power Conference. The countries will then proceed with the plan to deal with the current situation in Beijing, and plan to make a final application to Japan. This application is now being prepared and will be submitted to the plenary meeting of the Nine-Power Conference tomorrow morning. If approved, it will be issued immediately and request an immediate reply. When the Beijing Conference has exhausted its methods of reconciliation, it will face the difficulties that already existed when the meeting was convened, namely how to deal with this stalemate. Public opinion is that the answer to this question will come from Washington. People in Beijing believe that the Japanese reply has politely closed the door to the possibility of continuing negotiations with the Nine-Power Conference. (Central News Agency, December 12, Reuters)</p>
<p>Brussels According to French Foreign Minister Dalbos's statement last night, "Once the Japanese reply is received, we can decide what steps to take. We have decided to act quickly." This fact confirms the news circulating outside, and the attitudes of the countries after Japan refused to participate can be confirmed. Yesterday, the chief representatives of China, Britain, the United States, and France, including Gu Weijun, Eden, Davis, and Dalbos, held a meeting to discuss the situation, paying particular attention to the current situation in China. The meeting did not reach any conclusions, but it was heard that the possibility of issuing a declaration stating the efforts of various countries to mediate was discussed. The declaration may also make a final appeal to Japan and ask it to reply. It was also heard that this final contact could be made as early as Saturday. (Central News Agency Reuters, November 11)</p>

<h3>Japan's Use of Force Can Never Conquer All of China</h3>
<p>British Newspapers Express Doubt About the Success of German Mediation, Ambassador Gu Says Cooperation Among Nations Can Thwart Violence</p>
<p>[London] The Manchester Guardian commented on the Sino-Japanese War today, saying that Japan cannot solve its problems through military victories. If it wants to continue fighting until the entire Republic of China is defeated and the Chinese army is completely collapsed, even the most warlike Japanese seem to be daunted by this. However, the most doubtful thing today is whether Germany can find a basis for peace talks that can be accepted by both sides. The Chinese army can never accept Japan's peace terms under any circumstances. (Central News Agency, November 11, Reuters)</p>
<p>Brussels Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, gave a speech on American radio last night, mentioning President Roosevelt's statement that 90% of the world's people want peace. Gu said that there are many ways to stop international trampling on laws and aggression and achieve results with the unanimous goal and common determination of the majority of the world's people without resorting to force. If peace-loving countries take any joint mutual assistance plan, it will be enough to generate spiritual, diplomatic, and economic deterrent power and thwart the forces of turmoil and chaos in international life. For the sake of lasting peace, we must ensure that war cannot obtain any benefits. (Central News Agency, December 12, Reuters)</p>

<p>[London] At a meeting of the British Red Cross Society today, Chairman Sir Stanley stated that the London Mayor's fund for relieving Chinese refugees and wounded soldiers has now reached 70,000 pounds, and there are also many donations of goods such as blankets and clothing from all walks of life.

<h3>Japan Establishes General Headquarters</h3>
<p>Military Authorities Draft Military Orders, Expected to be Implemented Within Days</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to semi-official sources here, after a long period of negotiations, the government has reached a consensus on the establishment of a general headquarters, which will be established in Tokyo soon. This organization will be purely a military institution. The original plan to grant it the highest administrative power and wartime economic power in addition to military power has been cancelled. It is said that the reason for the delay in establishing the general headquarters is that the issue of reorganizing the cabinet is being considered at the same time, and opinions are quite divided. (Haitong Telegram, November 11)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The general headquarters decided by the government to establish is not based on the wartime general headquarters regulations promulgated during the Russo-Japanese War, but is established in accordance with another military order. This military order is currently being drafted by the army and navy authorities and can be completed in two or three days. The army and navy ministers will submit it for approval. If the procedures go smoothly, it can be implemented on the 15th or 16th of this month. The government is conducting an in-depth study by the relevant authorities due to the opinions of all parties on the organization of the general headquarters, but this is related to the issue of reforming the cabinet system, and the research work is inevitably slightly delayed. However, recently, the opinions of the army and navy authorities have been unified, and due to the progress of the battle situation in Shanghai, it has been decided to set up a general headquarters in Tokyo in the near future in order to achieve the goal of punishing China. The government will issue military orders after its preparations and procedures are completed. (Domei Telegram, December 12)</p>

<p>Five to Six Hundred People Killed</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Ogushi Mine in central Japan collapsed yesterday, and it is feared that at least five to six hundred people have died. It is heard that fifty children were buried in the mud. Also, about 300 miners from a certain copper mine have been burned to death. The landslide was very violent. The copper mine and the residences of 1,300 miners were almost completely swept away. The explosives stored in the mine exploded at that time, causing the surrounding area to become a sea of fire. It can be seen from several miles around. No less than 500 people are now going to rescue, but due to lack of water, the fire has not been extinguished. (Central News Agency, December 12, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Preliminary Talks Between Britain and Italy to Adjust Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Chamberlain Will Send a Letter to the Italian Prime Minister to Discuss Four Issues</p>
<p>[Rome] British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, held a lengthy talk this afternoon at the invitation of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. The preliminary stage of talks between Britain and Italy on adjusting relations has begun. It is heard that Ciano told the British Ambassador that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech at the New Mayor of London banquet expressed his willingness to promote relations with Italy, which Italy is very willing to realize and should be initiated by Britain first. Regarding the relations between Britain and Italy, Italian political figures have generally believed that British Foreign Secretary Eden is firmly opposed to rapprochement with Italy. Prime Minister Chamberlain is now preparing to hold talks with Italy. The Roman Diplomatic News published an article yesterday advocating that Britain should express its attitude and implement Prime Minister Chamberlain's claim to improve British-Italian relations. It is generally believed that this article was written by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. (Central News Agency, November 11, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the talks between Britain and Italy to adjust relations, Prime Minister Chamberlain will soon send a personal letter to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The draft letter is currently being drafted by personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In addition, the British government also intends to have Foreign Secretary Eden and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano hold talks, but this must be decided after Mussolini receives Prime Minister Chamberlain's letter and expresses his attitude. As for the preliminary talks between Britain and Italy that are currently being conducted through diplomatic channels, it is heard that they have encountered considerable difficulties. Because Britain previously requested that the issue of the Italian Radio Bari broadcasting anti-British programs in September last year be resolved first before talks could be held with Italy. The Italian side refuses to accept any preconditions, which is the difficulty. (Central News Agency, November 11, Havas)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the talks between Britain and Italy and Britain and Germany, Italian political figures believe that practical results can be obtained, and said that Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi met with British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Winstedt yesterday. British Ambassador to Italy Drummond also held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano today. In addition, British Privy Councilor Lord Halifax is about to go to Germany, all of which are good omens. Regarding the British-Italian talks, there are four main goals for Italy: ㊀ to promote British recognition of the Italian Empire, and ㊁ to indirectly weaken the British policy towards the Soviet Union. As for the future talks between Britain and Germany, the colonial issue will be the most important. (Central News Agency, November 11, Havas)</p>
<h3>British Privy Councilor Will Go to Berlin</h3>
<p>At the Invitation of the German Authorities</p>
<p>[London] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon stated in the House of Commons today that Viscount Halifax, Privy Councilor, will visit Führer Hitler in Berlin next week. The reason is that the German authorities plan to hunt near Berlin and invited Viscount Halifax to participate. Halifax has accepted, and the German invitation is purely private, said a general person who recognizes Halifax's visit to Germany, is actually the most important development in British-German relations after the European War, and hears that Foreign Secretary Eden is quite dissatisfied with this matter. (National Telegram, December 12)</p>
<p>[Berlin] It was recently heard that British Privy Councilor Halifax will come to Germany in the middle of next week. The political circles here expressed a warm welcome upon hearing this. It is said that Germany will take this opportunity to raise issues that are related to Germany's interests, and the colonial issue is one of them. No matter what path this conversation takes, Halifax will surely receive a warm welcome. (National Telegram, Central News Agency, December 12)</p>

Germany also supports this British proposal, but the Vatican Church advocates that Prince Francis, the leader of the Spanish Royalist Carlos faction, i.e. the Bourbon Royal Family, should ascend the throne as monarch.

<h3>U.S. Closely Watching Developments in Brazilian Politics</h3>

<p>[Washington] Regarding the establishment of a dictatorship in Brazil, U.S. Secretary of State Hull recently declined to comment, stating that an important agreement was established at last year's Pan-American Peace Conference, stipulating that American countries should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. "If the U.S. government were to formally comment on the situation in Brazil, it would inevitably conflict with this agreement," he said. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙ Capital of Brazil: Following the resignation of the Brazilian cabinet today, President Vargas has at least temporarily taken control of all executive and legislative power. Soon, Brazil will become the first country in the Americas to create a fascist-like political system. The new constitution was promulgated yesterday, granting dictatorial powers to the president and his cabinet. The president's first step was to announce the dissolution of all nationally elected organizations, such as the parliament and local councils. Now that the cabinet has also resigned, the president's second step will likely be to organize a four-part government, with legislation, administration, national economy, and justice all under the president's guidance, indirectly elected by the people. The president's term is six years, after which he can designate one or two people as his successors. The parliament will also be bicameral, but the president has the power to dissolve or postpone meetings at any time. The National Economic Council is an organization of professional groups, similar to Italy's fascist professional group organization. The president declared today that all current measures are temporary, pending a final decision by the National Assembly. Vargas will remain in office for the time being. If the National Assembly approves the new constitution, Vargas's term will end. At the same time, Vargas also announced a temporary halt to foreign debt payments, stating that Brazil does not want to take on even greater new debts to repay old debts. (11th National Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙ Capital of Brazil: Following the promulgation of the new constitution, satisfaction was expressed throughout the country. The governor of São Paulo even sent a telegram to President Vargas, stating that everyone was united, and all military institutions were as calm as ever. Foreign Minister Felinto Müller explained the changes in the political system to the foreign envoys. The cabinet has submitted its resignation en masse, allowing President Vargas to reorganize it as he sees fit. It is reported that Army Chief General Góis Monteiro, Navy Chief Admiral Guilhem, and Justice Minister Macedo Soares will all be reappointed. In addition, Brazil had originally abolished the death penalty, but it has now been reinstated by the new constitution to punish certain criminals. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Reactions in the Americas to Brazil's Implementation of Dictatorship</h3>
<p>⊙ Mexico City: Regarding the coup in Brazil, the Mexican General Confederation of Labor has issued an appeal to labor unions in Latin American countries, calling for joint protests and advocating for the prompt convening of a Latin American labor conference to resist fascism. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Washington] Diplomatic figures from South American countries recently commented on the coup in Brazil, saying that Brazil has benefited greatly from trade with the United States. If it leaves the U.S. sphere of influence, its economic life will be greatly affected, so President Vargas may not take it lightly and closely cooperate with dictatorial countries, thereby harming U.S. interests. The coup in Brazil has already triggered a reaction in the U.S. Congress. Senator Borah stated that the new Brazilian system has all the characteristics of fascism. He will resolutely oppose any actions that would help it succeed. The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee is currently discussing the proposal to lease six destroyers to Brazil, and it may agree with Borah's opinion and reject the proposal. In addition, the agreement between the U.S. and Brazil in July, stipulating that the U.S. could sell $50 million worth of gold to Brazil, may not continue to be fulfilled due to Brazil's plan to suspend foreign debt payments. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>The True Meaning of the Coup is Not Yet Fully Understood</h3>
<p>[Paris] Responsible individuals here recently commented on the coup in Brazil, saying that it is too early to say that the country has adopted a dictatorship, indicating that the true meaning of the coup is not yet fully understood. What can be said is that President Vargas's intention is clearly to revise the constitution, because under the original constitution, Vargas would not be able to be re-elected in next year's election. Vargas had already begun preparations months ago to ensure that his successor would follow his policies. However, the candidate Vargas supported, Américo de Almeida, had little chance of being elected. Conversely, his political opponent, José Américo de Almeida e Oliveira, was deeply supported by the business community and Brazil's three major newspapers, and was especially popular in Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. Recently, José Américo even published a letter to officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, stating that if a coup were to occur in the country, he hoped that the armed forces would not support it. It is generally believed that President Vargas launched the coup because of this letter. However, whether Vargas's actions will succeed depends on the loyalty of the armed forces, and the attitude of Brazil's anti-communist "Integralist Action" is also very important. (The party has nominated Plínio Salgado as its candidate for next year's election. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)</p>

<p>[Berlin] Regarding the coup in Brazil, German newspapers have praised it, saying that the conspiracies carried out by the Soviet Union in Brazil have suffered a fatal blow. The Berliner Tageblatt wrote, "Moscow has now lost another opportunity." As for the allegations in U.S. newspapers that the Brazilian coup was influenced by certain factions in France, they are malicious slanders. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Rome] News of the coup in Brazil has been widely reported in the local newspapers, but few have commented on it. Most newspaper headlines focus on the anti-communist and corporatist nature of the new Brazilian constitution, and say that foreign newspapers believe this is a victory for fascism. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙ Capital of Argentina: Brazilian Congressman João Neves da Fontoura, who fled here due to political differences with the Brazilian authorities, recently commented on the coup in his country, saying, "I firmly believe in the strength of the democratic forces in the country, and I am still optimistic even now. European fascism must seek support in South America in order to engage in war. Vargas fell into their trap because of indecision, which is regrettable. Vargas's so-called new system is actually fascism." Argentine Senator Alfredo Palacios said that Brazil has been played by the reckless, and that the so-called "corporatism or totalitarian government is absurd." In addition, the Argentine newspaper La Prensa reported that "the future of the American continent is bleak, and the signs are already visible. Fortunately, Brazilian farmers are inherently strong and will resist fascism." (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)</p>

It is the first time in the 19 years since the end of World War I that the Duke has not participated in the commemoration with his wartime comrades. It is said that the Duke originally intended to participate, but after hearing that the church minister, Dr. Darwell, said that the church's attitude towards divorce and remarriage was very strict, and that while he respected the Duke very much, he thought it would be better for the Duke not to participate in the religious service. The Duke was displeased upon hearing this and ultimately decided not to attend. (Central News Agency, 11th)</p>

<h3>Maintaining and Cherishing the Great Spirit of the Nation</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhonghua</p>
<p>Our troops on the Shanghai-Songhu battlefield, after three months of bloody battles, have moved and defended the second line of defense the day before yesterday. This second line of defense is the real national defense line on our eastern battlefield. From now on, our military's resistance will be much more convenient and much stronger than the bloody and arduous struggle on the temporarily built defense line over the past three months. This is something to be comforted by. However, for the past three months, our compatriots in Shanghai have heard the sounds of guns and cannons on the surrounding battle lines and seen the wounded soldiers covered in blood. Our fervent emotions for national independence and liberation have been constantly rising with this direct stimulation. Now, as the battle line moves further away, the sounds of our guns and cannons and our heroic soldiers are also gradually moving away from us. This may arouse feelings of grief and indignation in many compatriots, and these feelings of grief and indignation are a profound expression of our love and cherishment for our nation. However, what we want to encourage the millions of compatriots in Shanghai to do is that pure feelings of grief and indignation are useless. From now on, we should maintain and develop our great strength in cherishing the nation with a more tenacious and calmer spirit.</p>
<p>There is one point we need to recognize at present, that is, at least temporarily, the compatriots in Shanghai will be separated from the front line of the war of resistance. This situation will inevitably place the compatriots here in a more difficult life. Real news of the war of resistance will not be easily and quickly transmitted; certain tangible and intangible threats will gradually tighten; and some people who only care about their own interests and do not care about the overall situation may indulge in the immediate comfort and gradually forget the great struggle for national independence and liberation. Precisely because of this situation, we must remind the many compatriots here to strive to maintain the great spirit of cherishing the nation.</p>
<p>Everyone should remember that around Shanghai, our hundreds of thousands of soldiers have shed blood in the struggle for national liberation. Tens of thousands of heroic souls remain forever in the Shanghai-Songhu area. We cannot forget them, so we cannot forget our nation in the arduous struggle. On the other hand, on a wider front, our countless soldiers are still constantly fighting with the invaders. The sound of war drums will be transmitted far into our ears, and the cries of our countless newly emerging soldiers of the entire nation will continue to motivate us. As long as we grit our teeth, remain calm, and work hard, even though we are far from the front line of the war of resistance, we are not necessarily below the battle line.</p>
<p>The emotionally agitated period of the early stages of the war of resistance has passed; from now on will be a period of using reason to calmly and arduously fight. In our nation's long-term struggle for liberation, we cannot hope for short-term, unexpected great victories; but as long as the whole country is of one heart and perseveres, we will surely win the final victory. Therefore, we should more earnestly encourage each other, hoping that every compatriot will maintain the great spirit of cherishing the nation!</p>

<h3>Liu Xiang Arrives in Beijing and Gives a Speech</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Liu Xiang, Director of the Sichuan-Kangding Pacification Commission, arrived in Beijing by boat from Hankou on the morning of the 12th. He is scheduled to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the coming days to report on the military and political affairs of Sichuan and Kangding and to seek instructions on anti-Japanese strategies. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited him, and he gave the following speech: Japanese imperialism's policy towards our country is to eliminate our nation as the ultimate goal. However, our country is united from top to bottom, and under the leadership of the supreme leader, we are implementing a comprehensive and long-term war of resistance. It has only been three months, and the enemy's consumption has exceeded what they expected. Therefore, final victory will undoubtedly belong to our side. Sichuan Province is an important rear area and can contribute a lot to the government. In addition to mobilizing to participate in the war of resistance, we are currently working hard to develop resources. My visit to Beijing this time is to pay a visit to the supreme authorities, seek instructions on anti-Japanese strategies, and approve the construction plans for Sichuan Province. I will go to the front lines in the coming days to supervise the resistance of my troops, and I will not hesitate to make any sacrifices. In short, our country will survive if we resist, and perish if we are humiliated. I do not believe that a Chinese nation with thousands of years of history and culture will be defeated by Japan. I hope that the great popular strength of our country will resolutely resist to the end and decisively inflict a fatal blow on the enemy. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Joint Memorial Service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday Held by the Central Government and the National Government</h3>
<p>Lin Sen Reports on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Spirit of Resisting Japan</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Government and the National Government jointly held a memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday in the Central Auditorium at 7:00 AM on the 12th. Seventy-one members attended. Chairman Lin Sen presided and gave a report. The report is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Fellow comrades, today is the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, which can also be said to be the anniversary of the birth of the Three Principles of the People, and even more so the anniversary of the birth of the Republic of China. Because of the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, the Three Principles of the People were created. With the creation of the Three Principles of the People, the Republic of China was established. Therefore, how joyful and enthusiastic should we be in celebrating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday? However, the Republic of China, which was created with such difficulty by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, is now being wantonly invaded by the enemy. Brave and loyal soldiers throughout the country are fighting valiantly to resist the enemy. At this time, when we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, we should be even more determined in our will, concentrate our strength, and resist to the end to protect the Republic of China, which was created with such difficulty by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The enemy has sent a large number of troops to invade us and is using the most brutal means imaginable, such as massacring civilians and bombing cultural institutions, hospitals for the wounded, and refugee shelters. Although they have been condemned by the world for upholding justice, they have not ceased their brutal behavior. There is no doubt that they will be abandoned by the world. Our frontline soldiers are loyal and courageous in defending the country and sacrificing themselves heroically. Military experts from various countries who have gone to investigate have all praised them. Therefore, even though we are in difficult circumstances, as long as we raise our spirits, gather all the strength of the nation, and follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of fearlessness, we will engage in a long-term resistance against the enemy. Final victory will surely belong to us." (Central News Agency, 12th)</p>

<h3>Seeking to Unite the Nation and the People</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Publishes an Article (Continued)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] There is no country in the world that does not pay attention to its own survival. Having paid attention to its own survival, there is no country that does not guard against becoming isolated. Especially when a country is forced to fight with others for its survival, it will seek help. Since the implementation of the New Economic Policy and the two Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union has gradually become a strong country in the world. And its country is geographically in a situation where it is least afraid of invasion. However, it is so eager to pay attention to diplomatic relations and seek allies. If we hear such high-sounding talk, we will be startled, shrug our shoulders, and stick out our tongues. This is by no means a fabricated thought. In addition, there are some people who hold the view that China should at least set aside fascist countries, which is also wrong. The countries in the world today are not what they used to be. There will be no crusades because of Christianity and non-Christianity, and no civil wars because of Protestantism and Catholicism. The elements of uniting because of the same principles are far less close than uniting because of the same interests. China's relationship with these countries, in terms of principles, has its own political freedom, such as people choosing the system that is most suitable for their own national conditions and adding or subtracting from it for application. There is no need to force each other. In terms of interests, there is no conflict of interests between each other. Friendship and commercial relations and economic relations are increasing day by day. What reason is there to set him aside? Isn't this what Mencius said, "driving fish into the deep, and driving birds into the forest"? Especially Germany, because after the defeat, it has tasted suffering, and wants to get rid of unequal shackles and restore equal status. Its efforts are even more admirable. As for other countries, even if they do not have a close relationship with China, it is beneficial to the world and also beneficial to China to make fair claims on justice and humanity. For example, when the League of Nations voted on the Sino-Japanese issue, only Siam had previously abstained from voting. This time, in addition to Siam, there was only Poland. This shows that all countries are enthusiastic about maintaining justice and humanity, deeply abhor the atrocities of Japan, and have deep sympathy for China's determined resistance. These are all things that we cannot ignore. In short, since China's foreign policy has been determined to follow the path of international peace, anyone who opposes aggression can be China's allies. China can only do its best to win the sympathy of all countries, and then get the assistance of all countries, and then jointly impose sanctions on the aggressors with all countries. This is the attitude that China should take on weekdays, especially during the war of resistance. Furthermore, the purpose of uniting the people to resist the war is to save China from its decline and revive it. To achieve this goal, we must unite the 400 million people with the determination to die and make the greatest possible effort. Where the effort lies, the first is naturally military. If the 400 million people are trained and go to the battlefield, one after another, then the war of resistance will be protracted and achieve final victory. The second is politics, economy, finance, education, and even literature, etc., regardless of spiritual or material, everything must be concentrated and intensified. To say it more realistically, these tasks should not only not be relaxed because of the war of resistance, but also intensified because of the war of resistance. Because the significance of the war of resistance is not only to consume the enemy's strength in a passive way, but also to increase our strength in a positive way. This is the foundation for the war of resistance to be prolonged, and it is also the foundation for resisting the enemy to achieve final victory. In this way, the war of resistance is not only the business of the frontline soldiers, but the business of the people all over the country. Whether the people work hard or not is the biggest key to whether the war of resistance can be protracted and whether it can achieve final victory because of protractedness. Therefore, uniting the people is necessary in peacetime, and especially urgent during the war of resistance. The question now is, how can we unite the people? Some people say that during the European War, such as England and France, the people of the whole country were united regardless of factions. No matter how different the various opinions are on politics and economy, as long as they recognize that the country is above all else, they can unite and work together. This statement can naturally be done in England and France, where the national foundation has been established and democratic politics has been successful. If China, which is in the process of establishing the national foundation, and where democratic politics is just beginning to be trained and has not yet matured, must not be considered again today. Because in today's precarious situation, there must be a center for uniting the people, and there must be a principle as the center. With a principle, the people can clearly recognize the past, present, and future, and have an accurate direction for the future, and hold on to it, and move forward. It was said above that the war of resistance is not only military but also extends to politics, economy, finance, education, and even literature, etc. Since there are so many aspects, there must be a principle to command it. Just in terms of military, since March, the facts show that the combat capability of the army that has been trained in the Three Principles of the People must be strong. We don't have to list the serial numbers of the army, just the all-group martyrdom of Nankou, the all-battalion martyrdom of Baoshan, and the enemy soldiers on various fronts who have died without retreating without orders, are enough to prove it one by one. In summary, since March, there has not been a day or a time when the flesh and blood of the soldiers, especially the flesh and blood of the elite soldiers, has not been used to build trenches to block the enemy's advance. Why do they have this spirit of heroic sacrifice? Because they have been trained in the Three Principles of the People on weekdays, they understand that in terms of nationalism, they must be worthy of their ancestors and worthy of their descendants, and they understand that in terms of democracy and people's livelihood, they know that moving forward will surely lead China to freedom, equality, and light and happiness, otherwise it will be trapped in slavery. With the Three Principles of the People standing in front, leading them and guiding them to move forward, they are both energetic and calm, using their own flesh and blood to build a trench to block the enemy's invasion, and at the same time build a happy road for 400 million compatriots and their descendants to walk together. We believe that every elite soldier, when he sacrifices his life, will take the realization of the Three Principles of the People as his greatest price and supreme comfort. The same is true for the army, and the same is true for all other aspects. With principles, there is faith, with faith, there is sincerity, with sincerity, there is unity, with unity, there is strength, and with strength can we persist, and can we achieve final victory. Therefore, we should not talk about unity, but if we talk about unity, there must be a center, and the principle must be the center, and the Three Principles of the People must be the center. The comrades of the Chinese Kuomintang have a deep responsibility for the failure to realize the Three Principles of the People. The Chinese compatriots must also recognize that at this critical moment of life and death, only the Three Principles of the People can unite the people. Therefore, the recent declaration of the Chinese Communist Party also earnestly stated that it is willing to fight for the realization of the Three Principles of the People. If we are happy to unite the body of 400 million people into one body, and unite the hearts of 400 million people into one heart, then the war of resistance will surely be prolonged, and the prolongedness will surely achieve final victory, which is undoubtedly true. Today, during the war of resistance, when we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, we feel infinite emotion and infinite excitement. I offer these words as a small contribution.

<h3>Refugees Still Gather on the Streets in Bitter Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>A Corner of the Old North Gate is Opened to Transport Food; Father Raoult's Tireless Efforts and Chivalry are Admirable</p>
<p>A Corner of the Iron Gate Transports Food</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee is deeply concerned about the safety and sustenance of refugees in the South City. It has invited various charitable organizations for serious discussions and has asked Father Raoult to negotiate with the French Municipal Council to open the iron gate at the junction of the South City and the French Concession to transport food and settle refugees. However, the French authorities, considering the still tense situation in the South City, and to avoid accidents, have not yet agreed to do so temporarily. Only a corner of the iron gate at the Old North Gate has been opened, and the committee, together with various charitable organizations, is sending food for the refugees from there. However, many refugees who want to take refuge in the concession are still being blocked. Currently, along the Min'guo Road in the northern part of the South City, there are no less than 50,000 to 60,000 refugees gathered. For the past two days, they have been sleeping in the streets, exposed to wind and rain, and unable to eat when hungry. The situation is extremely miserable.</p>
<p>Since the change in our army's defense line, the South City has become a war zone. People are generally concerned about the refugee area set up by Father Raoult, which happens to be surrounded by the front line. Especially yesterday's report that the refugee area was cut off from supplies and the lives of more than 100,000 people were in danger. However, according to reporter investigations, the supply problem in the refugee area was handled the day before yesterday by the responsible persons of the city branch of the Refugee Relief Committee, together with He Fangli, a diplomatic expert from the Central Political Conference, and Lu Bohong and Wu Kaisheng, who negotiated with the French police. The French police issued a pass, and the Relief Association and the Charity Federation jointly prepared vehicles to transport bread and guangbing (a type of flatbread) from the iron gate of the concession at the Old North Gate, totaling 30,000 to 40,000 pieces, to distribute to the refugees in the reception center to satisfy their hunger, so there was no impact for the time being.</p>
<p>Suffering from Hunger and Cold is Unbearable</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency went to the iron gate at the border yesterday and saw that the refugees looked haggard, and some were sitting on the ground weeping silently, which was very heartbreaking. Although various charitable organizations and enthusiastic people in the concession were handing over large cakes and bread through the iron gate for relief, there were too few monks and too little porridge, which was of no help. Until about 1:00 PM, it suddenly rained, and the refugees' clothes were all wet. Suffering from hunger and cold, the suffering was unbearable. Various charitable organizations tried their best to dredge up all parties in order to help the refugees out of danger and maintain humanity. However, as of 5:00 PM, these refugees were still gathered there and had not retreated.</p>
<p>Actively Seeking to Restore Water for Refugees</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the International Relief Committee, the committee is currently engaging in multi-faceted contacts in order to ensure the comprehensive equipment of the refugee area in the South City. The most urgent matter at present is to raise sufficient supplies for the refugees and to restore the application of tap water in the area as soon as possible. The problem of tap water has now been discussed with the French authorities, who will send workers to connect the water pipes as soon as the situation turns slightly and within the possible range. The committee also plans to set up a permanent office in the area in order to handle daily affairs nearby.</p>
<h3>South City and Pudong Ravaged Amidst Smoke and Scorched Earth</h3>
<p>South Wharf Completely Burned and Rice Ships Also Sunk; Reliance on Righteous Ferries and the Essence of the Area Turned into Ashes by Fire</p>
<p>South City Since the day before yesterday, the area west of Xie Bridge in the South City has been reduced to scorched earth due to the indiscriminate throwing of incendiary bombs. The area east of Xie Bridge, from Lujiabang to Haichao Temple, was wantonly bombed by more than a dozen Japanese aircraft from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, so the houses are not complete. The area around the South Railway Station is also half scorched earth. The Family Industrial Society (ie, Invincible Brand Tooth Powder Factory) west of the local court was destroyed, and the Disabled Welfare Home in front of the local court was also destroyed. The houses in Huairenli on Huining Road behind the local court were completely destroyed. Many houses in the Liyuan Road area were destroyed, and even the Bingshe of the Yixi Guild Hall was affected. There are no intact houses between Lujiabang and the South Railway Station. Many houses in the Nan Wharf, Dongjiadu, Dama Wharf, Dadongmen, and Xian’gua Street areas were also bombed. Dozens of houses on both sides of Taiping Street in the city, including the Pharmaceutical Industry Association and the Fuxingyuan Restaurant, caught fire. Fortunately, the French Concession Fire Brigade connected the water to save them, so as to avoid affecting the refugee area. Therefore, after the entire street of Taiping Street to Dengyun Bridge was burned down, it was extinguished. Stray bullets hit the Dadongmen and Xiaonanmen areas, and many houses were also destroyed. The Bund area is almost half a pile of rubble. The South Wharf along the cordon was completely burned, and the ships on the shore, including rice ships, were all destroyed and sunk. The fires in Nanshi Manufacturing Bureau Road, Huining Road, Gaochang Temple, Longhua Road, and Sanpailou in the city have not been extinguished, and the fire is still raging. The black smoke in the sky is rising straight up, and it can be seen winding around. The scope is so wide that it is still burning at noon.</p>
<p>Starting at dawn yesterday morning, three enemy planes patrolled back and forth over the city of South City. Around 7:00 AM, two more planes flew in, and it took half an hour before they turned back. Around 10:00 AM, two more planes flew in to patrol.</p>
<p>Pudong There are currently about 5,000 enemy troops stationed in Pudong. Two-thirds have been assigned to the more than ten li along the Pu border south of Dongchang Road to fight against the South City. The large and small artillery positions arranged at each ferry port number forty to fifty. Yesterday, from morning to dusk, they launched a fierce bombardment of the Pu border area of South City. The destroyed warehouses and markets are countless. The Nanhangpu surface was filled with smoke. Looking from Pudong, the line of sight was blurred. There are still more than 2,000 enemy soldiers stationed in Yangjing Qichang Warehouse, Dongchang Road, Yangjiadu, and Tangqiao, carrying out their destructive work all day long. Relying on the righteous ferries, Dajie was still intact the day before yesterday. Starting from the Pudong Grand Theater in the north to the north of the Pawnshop Alley in the south, the essence of the area was turned into ashes after the fire yesterday morning. Although it rained continuously after noon, the fire did not diminish slightly. More than a hundred rooms on the Police Bureau Road west of Pudong Hospital and south of the hospital were also destroyed. Hundreds of houses in Wujia Alley were burned down. The Yihua Real Estate behind the Taikoo Company's warehouse was completely destroyed. Although the company tried its best to rescue it, it was of no avail. The Xiaoyangjing Temple was also burned down, and many houses on the Minfang Road of Nanshoutang in the south were also affected. No small number of rural villages such as Cao'an to Shengjiahang and Xijiazhai were destroyed. After the Huazhan of China Merchants Bureau was bombed and burned the day before yesterday, more than a dozen warehouses along the Pu border of the China Merchants South Station in Yangjiadu were also burned to the ground yesterday morning. All the local poor people who had not had time to escape were still numerous. Yesterday, they were all under surveillance. The young and strong were forced to fill hard labor, carrying military supplies, and the old and weak stayed at home and were not allowed to go out. Small enemy flags were distributed to each house to hang at the door.</p>

Commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday in Shanghai, its significance is even more profound and significant. After the report, the whole body stood up again and stood in silence for three minutes for the national martyrs. Then the meeting adjourned after shouting slogans. Although the memorial ceremony was short, the atmosphere at the meeting was very solemn, tense, and dignified.</p>
<p>Also, the banks and money houses in the city were closed for one day yesterday to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday to show their celebration. The Jianghai Customs was closed yesterday and stopped closing the customs all day. The Shanghai Post Office, parcel and remittance departments, also stopped working all day, and other departments were handled according to the Sunday working hours. The various branch offices also handled business according to the above time. The First Special District Local Court also stopped working for one day as usual. The court authorities had notified the public concession various police stations a day earlier that the transfer of prisoners would be stopped for one day.</p>
<h3>Various Food Organizations Try Their Best to Maintain People's Food</h3>
<p>Trying to Dredge up Sources and Adjust Prices; Soaring Prices Greatly Affect the Poor</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in view of the fact that food regulation is the most important thing at this time of tense situation and traffic obstruction, has ordered the four guilds of bean rice industry, rice shop industry, miscellaneous grain oil cake industry, and flour factory industry to try to dredge up sources and adjust prices. The above four guilds have ordered their members to try their best to maintain people's food. Rice shops such as Yuchengtai, Shunfeng, and Wanchang in the public concession and the French concession are selling as much as possible, with a limit of one yuan per person. The price of the first number is fourteen yuan. The retail price of flour on the market yesterday ranged from four yuan to four yuan and one corner. Flour factories such as Fuxin and Fufeng are rushing to produce flour to meet the needs of the market. The concession authorities have tried to transport the rice stored in the warehouses in the Hongkou District. Also, the foreign rice ordered by the concession authorities from foreign countries has arrived in Shanghai in the first batch and will be sold soon, so there is no need to worry about food in Shanghai. The situation in Shanghai has been tight in recent days, and transportation is difficult. Regarding the food problem, in addition to food, various salted fish and vegetables operated by the fish industry are essential ingredients. Now the fish shops in the Xiaodongmen Shiliupu area, in order to maintain the food supply, are trying their best to ensure that the sources will not be cut off.</p>
<p>In the past two days, the prices of various foods in the concession have soared. According to reporter investigations, the price of vegetables such as cabbage and turnips today reached 450 yuan per catty (previously, it was only sold for 70 to 80 yuan per catty). The prices of other vegetables, fish, crabs, etc. have also soared. The livelihood of the poor is greatly affected. According to the news from the local goods industry, it has urgently telegraphed to purchase vegetables from Shandong and other places, which will soon be transported from outside. At that time, the price of vegetables is expected to fall back.</p>
<h3>The City Need Not Worry About Rice and Grain</h3>
<p>Rice Stores to Start Selling at Fixed Prices Today　Large Quantities of Rice to be Shipped to Shanghai in Five Batches　A Conversation with He De-Kui</p>
<p>Because the rice originally stored in the rice stores of this city has mostly been sold out, and the source of rice and grain has been suddenly interrupted due to the impact of the war, many rice stores have temporarily suspended business due to lack of goods. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Mr. He De-Kui, Deputy General Manager of the Public Concession Works Bureau, yesterday and received the following statement. Mr. He first said that Mr. Zhang Nian-Xuan, Chairman of the Rice Merchants Association of this city, and others have requested assistance from the Public Concession Bureau due to the lack of rice and grain in the city. The Bureau has now reached an agreement with fifty retail rice stores to purchase rice from the Bureau starting from the 13th of this month (today), all of which will be sold at cost. The price is set at nine cents per catty, and each purchaser is limited to one yuan, in order to maintain the food supply for the general poor citizens. In addition, there are more than two hundred retail rice stores in the Public Concession, which are also planning to purchase rice from the Public Concession Bureau within the next few days and sell it at cost according to the above method. In this way, all retail rice stores in the Public Concession will have rice to sell, and there will be no more cases of business suspension due to lack of goods. The Public Concession Bureau still has 20,000 bags of rice in storage (each bag is 120 pounds, equivalent to 198 catties). In addition, a large quantity of rice will soon arrive in Shanghai. The first batch is 25,000 bags, which will arrive on the 19th of this month. The second batch is 30,000 bags, which will arrive on the 21st of this month. The third and fourth batches are also 30,000 bags each, which will be shipped to Shanghai on the 23rd and 25th of this month. The total of the above is 115,000 bags. In addition, there are more than one hundred inland rice boats docked on the Huangpu River, totaling about 20,000 dan (each dan is equivalent to 160 catties), which should arrive in Shanghai within a few days. As for those who do not eat rice but only eat wheat flour products, it is even less of a problem. There are currently more than 500,000 bags of flour (each bag is 49 pounds) and more than 800,000 bags of wheat in the safe area of the city. Each bag can produce two bags of flour, so the total amount of flour stored in the city should be more than 2.9 million bags. From the above, it can be seen that the rice and grain in this city is abundant, and there is no need to worry about shortage. The citizens of this city should not be overly concerned.</p>
<h3>200,000 Refugees in the City</h3>
<p>Urgently Awaiting Alms and Relief</p>
<p>As of this morning, the total number of refugees in the city is over 60,000 in the Public Concession, over 50,000 in the French Concession, and 100,000 in the Nanshi (Chinese City), totaling over 200,000 people who urgently need alms and relief. Yesterday, more than one hundred refugees from Pudong fled to Shanghai, a truly tragic scene.</p>
<h3>Coal Stored in Pudong Taken Away by the Enemy</h3>
<p>The coal depot at the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong originally stored a large amount of fuel coal. However, after the enemy troops landed a few days ago, many enemy ships and sand boats went to load and transport it away. Therefore, the coal stored in that area has now been reduced by more than half.</p>
<h3>Robbery with Injury at Dongxin Bridge</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, robbers suddenly broke into the Hehexing Noodle Shop at a certain address in Dongxin Bridge and robbed it. They stole more than 200 yuan in legal tender and fled with the loot. The shop owner shouted for thieves from behind. The robbers immediately took out a pistol and fired a shot as a warning. A shop assistant named Sun Xiquan (51 years old) was unfortunately shot in the waist and seriously injured. Nearby Chinese constables arrived after hearing the alarm, but the robbers had already fled. They had no choice but to send the injured person to Renji Hospital for treatment in an ambulance.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Concession Issue</h3>
<p>— Should</p>
<p>Since our troops temporarily retreated from the vicinity of Shanghai for strategic reasons, the land transportation between the Shanghai Concession and the inland has been cut off. The citizens in the Concession inevitably have deep concerns about the political protection they receive. Therefore, the Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission and Mayor Yu each issued earnest announcements yesterday to inform the compatriots in the city. What they said greatly encouraged and gave confidence to the millions of citizens in Shanghai. Every citizen should keep these words deeply in mind.</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai Concession is now completely under the control of the enemy's military force, various government agencies of our country still exist within the Concession. The Concession authorities also strictly maintain their original powers. Of course, there should be no problems with all our country's sovereignty within the Concession. If there is any wavering, it will be a matter of the fate of the entire Concession.</p>
<p>We believe that military force cannot conquer everything, and that world justice and peace are ultimately an irresistible force. Especially for Shanghai, where international relations are very complex, military force cannot solve political problems. Recently, representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France discussed the Shanghai Concession issue in Brussels. Although the content is unknown, it can be asserted that these three major countries will adhere to the principle of respecting our country's sovereignty. Because if they do not do so, those countries will not be able to protect their interests in China.</p>

<h3>Retreating Military and Police Urgently Need Cotton Clothing and Food</h3>
<p>After our Nanshi military and police retreated under orders, some of them lost contact and retreated into the French Concession. The uniforms they wear are mostly torn. People from all walks of life are urgently requested to rush to make cotton-padded coats and pants or夹袄夹裤, and send them for replacement. The style must be the same as ordinary military uniforms. The material is limited to gray cloth. If you are not clear, you can consult the military uniform stores. After they are made, please hand them over to the Shanghai Municipal Comfort Committee • Municipal Chamber of Commerce • Local Coordination Association. In addition, a large amount of rice is needed, and donations are also expected. If it is inconvenient to buy, you can hand over the cash to the above-mentioned places for handling. Except for these two items, clothing and rice, nothing else is needed. Please do not send anything else.</p>
<h3>Reconsidering the Method of Buying Bonds with Rent</h3>
<p>A Special Task Force Sends a Letter to the Real Estate Association</p>
<p>The First Special District Team of the National Salvation Bonds Citizens Mobilization Corps sent a letter to the Real Estate Association yesterday, stating: "The purchase of national salvation bonds with rent is unanimously hoped for by all sectors. Your association previously resolved and announced to landlords to use one month's rent in September to purchase bonds, which shows sincerity in patriotism and is deeply admired. However, considering the economic depression in the city in recent years, most tenants are in arrears with rent. It will be difficult to exchange bank bond receipts for rent receipts for September until the arrears are cleared. At the same time, although the case has been published by your association in newspapers to notify landlords, few landlords have notified tenants accordingly. As a result, most tenants are doubtful and afraid that after buying public bonds with rent, they will be rejected by the landlords. Therefore, the campaign to buy public bonds with rent, although noisy for several months, has had little effect, which is a major regret for the public bond raising. After discussion at the meeting of the team leaders of this team, it was agreed that in view of the severity of the national crisis, landlords should be responsible for contributing money to save the country. The Real Estate Association should be requested to reconsider as soon as possible and cancel the stipulation of designating the rent for September. Any tenant who uses one month's rent to purchase public bonds on behalf of the landlord will be allowed to exchange it for the rent receipt for the most recent month. The landlord should also announce the method to the tenants in advance to facilitate the implementation. etc." It was recorded in the minutes. In addition to making suggestions to the National Salvation Bonds Mobilization Headquarters, a corresponding record was made and a letter was sent to your association for verification and prompt reconsideration. In addition, in order to understand the real estate situation in the First Special District and to persuade the tenants, this team requests your association to provide a copy of the membership list and a statement of the members' assets for reference. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>The Electrical Industry Raises More Than 50,000</p>
<p>The Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association believes that national salvation bonds are necessary to enrich national resources and expand war preparedness. Since the establishment of the branch team, it has worked hard to promote purchases among its members, and the results have been quite good. The first reported payment was more than 47,000 yuan, and the second was more than 4,000 yuan. The association is still actively raising funds.</p>
<h3>Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, and Others Launch a Campaign to Expand Comfort to Soldiers</h3>
<p>Seeking Overseas Chinese Leaders and Widespread Organization　Encouraging Soldier Spirit, Comforting the Families of the Dead and Wounded, and Aftercare</p>

If there are no children, continue to provide support. (The rest omitted)</p>
<h3>The United States Should Not Adopt an Isolationist Policy</h3>
<p>Long History of Sino-American Relations　This Move is Harmful to China　Remarks at a Banquet by the US Commercial Counsellor</p>
<p>The China Press reported that officers of the US military stationed in Shanghai held a banquet at the American Club last night (the 11th) to celebrate the anniversary of the armistice of the European War. Mr. Arnold, the US Commercial Counsellor, was also one of the guests. In his speech, he mentioned the long history of Sino-American friendship and commerce in the last decade of the 18th century. At that time, only sailboats were used for development. It was not until the establishment of the states on the Pacific coast that the United States re-emphasized its interests in China. Many Chinese products are used in American manufactured goods, such as carpets, pillows, toothbrushes, soap, tin, paint, hairnets, eggs, etc. Therefore, the American people are unknowingly in daily contact with Chinese products. Mr. Arnold deeply regretted the United States' adoption of an isolationist policy, saying that the Great Wall of China is now collapsing, while the United States is building a Great Wall around itself. This is obviously harmful, but he hopes this is only a temporary measure and urged the audience to strive to promote commerce and build a larger fleet of merchant ships. These factors can break the isolationist policy.</p>

<h3>Land Transportation in the City is Blocked, but Shipping is Open</h3>
<p>Accessible to Hong Kong, Ningbo, and Qingdao　Goods and Mail Rely on Transfer</p>
<p>After the retreat of our army from west Shanghai, the land transportation from this city to other ports was completely cut off by the enemy. Currently, the only way to transfer from Shanghai to other ports and then to the interior is by sea: ① From Shanghai to Tongzhou, transfer to Zhenjiang, with highways and railways to various places; ② From Shanghai to Qingdao, transfer to the interior via the Jiaoji Railway; ③ From Shanghai to Hong Kong to Guangzhou; ④ From Shanghai to Ningbo to Hangzhou. Recently, many people have been leaving on each trip. Therefore, freight and mail can still rely on transfer.

The management is quite meticulous and focuses on cleanliness and hygiene. In winter, cloth and cotton wool are purchased, wages are paid, and the refugees are asked to sew cotton quilts and coats for the refugees to protect themselves from the cold. The goodness of its handling and the benefit to the victims after the robbery are by no means shallow. However, under long-term subsistence, the Society is deeply worried about its weakness and inability to maintain it for a long time. It still relies on people from all walks of life to assist, so that these more than a thousand wretched birds will not have to worry about losing their shelter.</p>

<h3>New Frontline After Our Abandonment of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Retreated from Sijing Town, Now Holding the Songjiang-Sijing Highway　Fierce Battles Along the Songjiang-Fengjing Line for Days　The Line from Qingpu to Huangdu and Nanxiang is Very Stable</p>
<p>Special Report from This Newspaper: Our army's left-wing positions are still firmly defending the line from Guangfu to Liuhe. The north-south defense lines of Nanxiang to Huangdu in the middle are also unchanged. Although the enemy has been constantly advancing along the Jinghu Road and Nanda Highway for days, they have been repelled by our army. However, on the right-wing, the enemy's offensive in the area from Sijing to Songjiang is extremely fierce. There have been fierce battles on all roads for several days, especially near Sijing and Songjiang. According to news obtained this morning, Sijing Town has been abandoned by our army because it has no defensible terrain. It is now firmly defending the south bank of Sijingtang and Wenguanbang outside the town along the Songjiang-Sijing Highway, and has blown up the three stone bridges of the bang. In addition, our army has close contact with the line from north of Qingpu to Huangdu. As for the area along the railway line from Songjiang to Fengjing, our side has heavy troops to prevent the enemy from advancing. There were fierce battles on both yesterday and the day before.</p>
<h3>Blockade Line of the Huangpu River Destroyed</h3>
<p>Three Enemy Shallow Water Warships Entered the Southern Huangpu This Morning</p>
<p>The Huangpu River between Xiaodongmen and Laiyidu in Nanshi has been blockaded by us since before the outbreak of the war as a precaution. The enemy warships have never been able to go deeper inland. Now that Pudong and Nanshi have fallen into enemy hands one after another, the enemy is trying to destroy the obstacles blocking the Huangpu River. According to reliable information, a section along the Pudong side has been destroyed by them. At about 6:00 AM this morning, three enemy shallow water warships, fully loaded with soldiers, entered the Southern Huangpu but have not been seen leaving.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Pudong and Nanshi have completely fallen into enemy hands. The blockade line in front of the Ningbo-Shaoxing Wharf at the 16th Pier has been destroyed. The two municipal ferries, large sand boats, tugboats, barges, and other ships originally docked in the river have all been robbed by the enemy. One Zhonghe merchant ship has been towed away, and the others are still docked there, but all are flying the Japanese flag. One enemy warship, the one that shelled Nanshi the day before yesterday, and multiple shallow water warships and small boats, fully loaded with sailors and weapons, sailed upstream along the river at about 6:00 AM this morning to reinforce various places. The Ningbo-Shaoxing warehouses along the Pudong have been shelled by the enemy more than a hundred times, with many scars and serious damage. The waste along the Pudong and in the river is piled up in an extremely chaotic manner. The bustling area has become a dead city. Only eagles and birds can be seen circling over the water.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops in Pudong Announce Martial Law</h3>
<p>The enemy occupying Pudong announced martial law this morning and dispersed to various towns and villages, searching for people deemed suspicious. At the Pudong branch of Tianzhang Paper Mill, Shifanli, Wujiatong, Wu Ade's house, and other places, 400 to 500 people were detained for interrogation. The area of ​​several hundred acres from the Dongchang Road intersection eastward to Shantang Road Chaobei, through Wujiatong along Huayuanshi Bridge Road, to Laiyidu Main Street Chaonan, has been designated as a place to store military supplies. Poor people who have remained and have not left are forced to move out and are only allowed to take boats to Puxi. They were told that they would not be allowed to move back until a week later.</p>
<h3>Order in the Northern Concession of Suzhou Creek is Gradually Restoring</h3>
<p>Large Numbers of Refugees Sent to Shelters　Residents and Factories Gradually Recovering</p>
<p>The area north of Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession, from North Jiangxi Road to North Xizang Road (which is the British military zone), has been extremely dangerous since the outbreak of the Shanghai war due to stray bullets flying around in the war zone. Therefore, most residents moved to the area south of Suzhou Creek or the French Concession, accounting for eight or nine tenths of the entire area. Only those who remained were generally poor and unable to move, and the situation felt obviously deserted. In order to maintain public security and stability, the police authorities specially announced a curfew as early as 6:00 PM and turned off all the street lights north of Suzhou Creek. Therefore, from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM, it was completely dark. However, since our Zhabei garrison retreated on the 26th of last month for strategic reasons, there has been no danger of stray bullets in the area, and the situation has gradually become safe. Trolleybuses on Route 6 have also been running. The street lights on North Zhejiang Road, Qipu Road, and the alley lights in the lanes have also been completely turned on since yesterday, except for the section north of North Zhejiang Road and Haining Road, which is still not lit. Peng Road Municipal Feihong Primary School and Qunyi Girls' School in front of No. 920 Haining Road have been designated by the authorities as refugee shelters. A large number of refugees have been sent in yesterday, and the number of returning residents is also increasing day by day. The problem is that the landlords in the area cannot collect rent from the tenants, so they have notified the water company to cut off the water. The water in the well-known North and South Gaoshouli on Haining Road has also been cut off. Most residents are taking water from the Suzhou Creek for use. Although the Chinese Ratepayers' Association has issued a notice, advising landlords to restore the water supply, but it has not been implemented. It is heard that the curfew time in the area may be changed to be later due to the recent gradual stability. However, it is not yet known whether it can be adopted to be at 11:30 PM as south of Suzhou Creek. De Xing, Li Xing Tobacco Companies, and the main factory of the Great Eastern Book Company in the area, as well as other factories, have all resumed work as usual.</p>
<h3>南匯逃滬者談失陷經過</h3>
<p>Account of the Fall from a Refugee from Nanhui Fleeing to Shanghai</p>
<p>County Magistrate Abandoned Post and Fled on the 5th, Entire County in Chaos and Looting Occurred</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports that after enemy troops landed in Pudong, residents of Nanhui County also fled to Shanghai one after another. This morning, a reporter met with</p>
<p>A Mr. So-and-so from the Nanhui</p>
<p>Education Sector, who had just fled to Shanghai on the 11th. According to him, after the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, the situation in Nanhui was still relatively stable. Although enemy planes had flown over, they had not dropped any bombs. It was not until around 1:00 PM on the 5th of this month that an enemy plane came to bomb, dropping three bombs,</p>
<p>All of which landed in the County Town</p>
<p>One landed at the intersection of the main streets, and two landed inside the East Gate, destroying thirty to forty houses and killing or wounding more than twenty civilians. The county government and its affiliated agencies, as they were all located in the North Gate, were undamaged. The plane then flew to the Datuan Town under the county's jurisdiction and dropped two bombs, landing in the playground of Datuan Elementary School. The glass of nearby houses was shattered. The faculty and students of the school</p>

<h3>弔鄭將軍</h3>
<p>In Memory of General Zheng</p>
<p>— Wang Xiushen</p>
<p>General Zheng Tingzhen, Major General of the Army and Commander of the Independent 5th Brigade, bravely supervised the battle during the Battle of Dabaihui on the 16th of this month and sacrificed himself for the country. Zheng was a native of Tuocheng County, Henan Province, 42 years old. His father had passed away, but his mother was still alive. He left behind five children, all of whom were extremely intelligent. His wife was extremely virtuous. Zheng joined the army in the 6th year of the Republic (1917) and had a deep understanding of military science. He served as brigade commander in the Northern Expedition campaigns of the 17th year of the Republic (1928) and repeatedly made outstanding achievements. He had a reputation as a brave general during the Second Group Army era. In recent years, he led his troops to suppress bandits and made even greater contributions. Zheng was extremely generous, loyal, and upright. He had no private savings and distributed his salary to his officers and soldiers, which is why he gained the trust of his superiors and the respect of his subordinates. He usually trained his soldiers with strict discipline, but with a combination of kindness and authority, treating his officers and soldiers like his own children, so they were happy to give their lives when faced with battle. This summer, when I served as the commander of the Third Suppression Zone in the border area of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, Zheng also served as the deputy commander and provided much assistance. Later, due to the Japanese invasion, he was ordered to go to war in late August. Zheng led his entire brigade of elite soldiers north before me, and then I also led my troops on an eastward expedition. Due to the urgency of time, I did not meet with Zheng for a final conversation. We encouraged each other in telegrams to strive to kill the enemy to repay the country, and then we said goodbye. Now that Zheng has died before me for righteousness, how can I not grieve? At this critical moment of the war of resistance, as we strive for final victory, the loss of this brave general is extremely regrettable.</p>

<p>Japan Refuses to Participate in the Beijing Conference, Negotiations Completely Blocked</p>
<p>Breaking the Stalemate Depends on the Attitude of the United States. Japanese Sources Say US-Japan Contacts are Possible</p>
<p>⊙Beijing The rejection by Japan of the second request to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference leads many to believe that, apart from discussing the matter on Japan's own terms, any possibility of continuing negotiations with the Japanese government has been completely blocked. The current plan for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to hold a closed-door discussion today regarding the Japanese reply, hoping to adopt a memorandum that provides a complete account of the true situation of the Sino-Japanese War. A public meeting will also be held this morning or afternoon, where British Foreign Secretary Eden and US Chief Representative Davis are expected to deliver important speeches to the attendees. Representatives of the British Commonwealth may also make speeches. There is reason to believe that the meeting will be adjourned after today's meeting to allow the representatives to consult with their respective governments. Eden will return to London to welcome the King and Foreign Secretary of Belgium, Spaak. The first intention of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference after learning of the Japanese government's reply rejecting the request was to make a final appeal to Tokyo. However, after Eden consulted with the representatives, they felt that the wording of the Japanese reply was firm and that continuing to make requests would be futile. Therefore, this intention has been abandoned. Now, all methods of mediation have been exhausted, which has made the Nine-Power Treaty Conference difficult to handle. This difficulty has been lurking behind the scenes since the beginning of the conference, namely, how to deal with the stalemate. Many believe that the answer must await instructions from Washington.

They ask for relief." "According to the current situation, it is feared that river rice boats will not easily come to Shanghai. However, Anhui Province has a good harvest and river boats are still open, so it seems possible to find ways to transport and aid. Your association should discuss and decide on separate purchase and transport methods to provide assistance and reassure the people.

<p>The war of resistance has now reached three months. Since the loss of Nanshi, the entire Shanghai war situation has been completely different. Now the war situation has expanded to Songjiang, Qingpu, Fengjing, Shihuozao, and other places. Our heroic soldiers are still fighting bloody battles. Recalling the past three months, the losses suffered by our people due to the war cannot be counted in numbers. As for the success or failure of the war, it is still difficult to predict. As for the millions of refugees who are displaced, homeless, without clothes to wear, and without rice to eat, this is truly one of the most serious and urgent problems at the moment. Is there no way to deal with the aftermath? To whom shall we turn for help? When I think of this, I cannot help but feel my heart break and my liver split.</p>

<h3>饒神甫盡力維持難民給養秩序</h3>
<p>Father Jacquinot Does His Best to Maintain Order in Refugee Supplies</p>
<p>Organizing a Vigilante Team to Maintain Order, Delivering Supplies Twice a Day, Many Refugees are Sick and Eagerly Awaiting Medical Treatment</p>
<p>Since our army withdrew from Nanshi under orders, the refugee area issue has been deeply concerned by all parties. A New News Agency reporter visited the Shanghai International Relief Committee this morning to inquire. According to the person in charge of the Committee, although Nanshi has been occupied by the Japanese army, there is absolutely no problem in the refugee area. Father Jacquinot, the initiator, is currently in charge of everything in the area. The rumors that the enemy army had entered the refugee area have been denied by Father Jacquinot. The refugees currently sheltered are very safe, and the order in the area is being maintained by a vigilante team organized after the police withdrew with our army. The water and electricity problems have also been addressed by Father Jacquinot, who has requested the French authorities to open them. Once the situation improves slightly, the water pipes can be connected as far as possible. As for supplies, the Committee has formulated a plan to transport them in two batches every day at 8:30 AM and 3:00 PM. If people from all walks of life donate supplies, they can go directly to Room 318, 3rd Floor, Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, to be forwarded. It is also learned that the refugees gathered in the area along the Republic Road are being relocated by various charitable organizations to the refugee area for settlement.</p>
<p>The Tzu Lien Hui Refugee Relief Association, considering that the number of refugees in the refugee area within the city and those who have not been able to enter the Concession is extremely large, made a special large batch of food last night and tried to deliver it to Republic Road to supply the refugees. Today, it purchased two or three thousand pieces of bread, Guangbing biscuits, and steamed buns and delivered them to the International Relief Committee for forwarding to the refugee area. In addition, the drivers of the British-owned trolley company in the city initiated a fundraising campaign to purchase food and send it to the relief effort.</p>
<p>It is also reported that since the area northeast of Fangbang Road was designated as a refugee area, refugees from various places have continued to arrive one after another. The Yi Temple, Yu Garden, Qianye Nei Garden, the Jewelry Industry Branch, and other places are full of refugees, especially along the main road. According to statistics, the approximate numbers are:</p>
<p>Pudong: 57,000 people</p>
<p>Along the Huangpu River at the Great Wharf: 10,000 people</p>
<p>Pengpu to Caohejing: 3,000 people</p>
<p>Rihui Port Xietu Road: 15,000 people</p>
<p>Southwest of Fangbang Road: 21,000 people</p>
<p>Transferred from the Concession: 30,000 people</p>
<p>Others: 50,000 people</p>
<p>The above totals 166,000 people. At the beginning of winter, with the cold air coming in, without shelter, without food, without clothes, and without water, the suffering of the refugees is indescribable. Before the 11th, the Fire Brigade, the Protection Corps, the Police Boy Scouts, the Red Cross Society, the Protection Corps, and others maintained order. On the 12th, there was no one in charge, and the refugees were crying out for food, and the situation was extremely tragic, especially for women and children. According to Dr. Hua Jun, who is at No. 8-10 Fuyou Road, three or four out of ten refugees are sick, and he is the only one who has the responsibility to provide free consultations in the past few days. Two pregnant women gave birth to a son and a daughter in front of the Bodhisattva in the City God Temple, and he delivered them. There was also a pregnant woman of four months whose abdomen was pierced by a shrapnel fragment, with about two inches of large intestine flowing out. He bandaged and stitched it up, and arranged for her to be taken by the fire brigade's ambulance next to Xinkai River to a hospital in the Concession for treatment and rest. There are also many cases of gastrointestinal diseases, nervous disorders, and so on. It is hoped that the traditional Chinese medicine community in the Concession will go to the refugees to relieve their suffering in the spirit of human mutual aid.</p>

<h3>Guerrilla Warfare and People's Organizations (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Nianci</p>
<p>(4) Firmly Establish Clear Field and Organize Iron Masses: Since one of the greatest missions of the guerrillas is to clear the fields, they must have close contact with the local people to achieve the goal of uniting the military and the people. When they leave, they must find ways to hide the food so that the enemy cannot get anything to eat when they come and cannot settle in.</p>
<p>(5) Use Light Weapons: As mentioned earlier, the guerrillas' equipment should be as easy to carry as possible, so they mostly use light weapons such as rifles and machine guns. They do not have any heavy equipment, and they have to move around, so at most they only need a few small cannons and mortars. There is no fixed type of gun. It is best to use the same type as the enemy. If they intercept the enemy's bullets, they can load them into their guns and use them.</p>
<p>(6) Secret Movements: When the guerrillas set off, the destination is usually unknown to all the team members except the officers. Everyone just follows the leader forward. Only after arriving at the destination do they realize where they are going.</p>
<p>(7) Decentralization: When the guerrillas do not have a mission, they do not gather together. Because everyone has the ability to work, they disperse to all directions when there is nothing to do. But when dispersing, they agree in advance that everyone must gather on time at a certain time. Therefore, when gathering, it is very quick and there is no need to call them together.</p>
<p>The Tasks of the Guerrillas</p>
<p>1. Organize the People: When the guerrillas arrive in a place, the first step is to assign team members to organize the people. Because their food and geographical problems need to be solved by the people.</p>
<p>2. Disrupt the Enemy's Transportation: When they know that the enemy is going from one place to another or transporting money, they immediately send people to disrupt a certain section of the transportation in order to cut off the enemy's reinforcements and risk starvation, thus losing their combat effectiveness.</p>
<p>3. Restrain the Enemy's Forces: When the enemy is attacking a certain place, they immediately go behind the enemy to attack, or attack from the left and right flanks, causing the enemy to be attacked from both sides.</p>
<p>4. Tire the Enemy: After finding out where the enemy is stationed, they immediately go to attack. When the enemy counterattacks, they immediately retreat and then detour to the other side to attack. Repeating this continuously tires the enemy and makes them unable to figure out where their main force is, wasting a lot of ammunition and strength, and in the end getting nothing.</p>
<p>5. Starve the Enemy: The guerrillas hide all the food in the places they pass through so that the enemy cannot eat it. Moreover, the enemy's own food is often looted by them. Even the cloth wrappings are poisoned, and the enemy is not allowed to drink any water, forcing the enemy to retreat immediately.</p>
<p>The Necessary Conditions for Guerrillas</p>
<p>The life of a guerrilla is very difficult. Although there are no strict conditions, every team member must have the following:</p>
<p>(1) Able to Walk: Walking two or three hundred miles a day is nothing.</p>
<p>(2) Able to Endure Hardship: If there is food today, everyone should eat more. If there is none, it doesn't matter if they don't eat for one or two days.</p>
<p>(3) Familiar with Geography: Every time they arrive in a place, they must have a deep understanding of the paths and dangerous passes of that place.</p>
<p>(4) Gunmanship Must Be Absolutely Accurate: The number of guerrillas is not large, so they cannot carry a large amount of ammunition. They are very careful with bullets and will never fire a shot indiscriminately. Moreover, when shooting, they should focus on shooting the enemy officers, because an army without officers will suffer a considerable loss in strength. Therefore, gunmanship must be absolutely accurate.</p>
<p>(5) Able to Go Deep into the People: Because the guerrillas need to have contact with the people, every team member must have the ability to go deep into the people.</p>
<p>(6) Fight Even Without a Gun: Sometimes when they find the enemy, they must persevere even if they don't have a gun in their hand. On the one hand, they try to seize the enemy's weapons.</p>
<p>Enemy Army Categories</p>
<p>If we want to know which category our enemy—the Japanese army—belongs to, just look at their collar badges. Now I will describe them one by one:</p>
<p>A. Infantry: Red collar badge</p>
<p>B. Artillery: Yellow collar badge</p>
<p>C. Cavalry: Dark blue collar badge</p>
<p>D. Engineers: Purple collar badge</p>
<p>E. Supply troops: White collar badge</p>
<p>If you want to know how many people there are, just look at the flags. One "company" is about the same as two "companies" in our army. One "battalion" is equal to two "battalions." One "regiment" is equal to a "regiment."</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In addition to their own conditions, the guerrillas must also hope that the people will help them in an organized way, so that they can achieve the effect of defeating the many with the few, waiting for the enemy to become exhausted, fighting anywhere, and destroying everywhere. Their combat is completely based on an active position and does not have the extravagant hope of occupying land. This kind of tactic is most useful in weak countries that are being invaded, because weak countries are always at risk of being invaded, and they do not have sufficient strength and armaments. Once they are invaded by the great powers and cannot resist, they can only use guerrilla warfare to gradually eliminate the enemy's entire strength, so that it loses its ability and ambition to invade. In addition, we can also adopt the principle of cultivating a huge army in the future, and our people, who are regarded as a heap of loose sand, can easily unite as a result. (End)</p>
<h3>China's Little Heroes</h3>
<p>— Liu Yucai</p>
<p>In this war in Shanghai, most of the Chinese people have demonstrated their true and noble value!</p>
<p>The war clouds and turmoil are shaking this big city. The relief of war refugees, the supply of food, and all other wartime problems are enough to keep the Shanghai government authorities busy. At this time, there are many public-spirited people who are doing their best to serve the country and the people with their loyalty and efforts. Such a heroic and righteous spirit! We can hear and see it at any time from the outbreak of the war until now; but there is another large group of young people, their admirable, simple, intelligent, brave and martial spirit! It has been deeply recognized and praised by the general public.</p>
<p>Admirable Heroes</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, more than 1,500 boy scouts have been mobilized immediately to serve their motherland. This large group of boy scouts are the Chinese Boy Scouts who have performed countless valuable duties for their motherland, which has been invaded by the enemy! Most of them are only about sixteen years old. Since the outbreak of the war, they have dedicated all their time and strength to the motherland in distress.</p>
<p>Their work often takes them in and out of terrifying bombed areas. Their figures can be seen at any time in those bombed-out areas. They carry out their tasks with the inherent strong consciousness of young people, in situations where most older people are most cowardly. Whenever a tragic bombing of the masses occurs, these young people are always there. Whether they are dead or dying, as long as they can see them, they are duty-bound to rescue them. From this point of view, we can imagine how brave and strong the passion and patriotic feelings of these young boy scouts are! Here we must also remember that they are all teenagers who have not yet reached adulthood!</p>
<p>Work is Obligatory</p>
<p>Their loyal and patriotic sentiments are so intense and solemn that it seems there can be nothing more than this. One-third of their group is assigned to work in various military hospitals. The working hours every day often exceed 12 hours. The work situation of the brothers who serve in other areas is also equally intense! Because of the needs of the actual situation, they all live at the place where they serve. The funds received by the Boy Scout Headquarters from the superiors are completely used for essential work. The items donated by the people are all used for relief purposes. Even their uniforms are entirely paid for by themselves. They are definitely turning every penny over to the public and do not receive a penny for themselves.</p>
<p>Boy Scouts Help People</p>
<p>Under the anger and hatred of the Chinese people in Shanghai, when they hear the shout of "beat the traitors" in the streets, some people are often implicated wrongly. When boy scouts see suspicious crowds, they can be alert and help innocent people to avoid insult and beating. Some merchants take advantage of the fire to loot, deliberately raising the prices of daily necessities, which in turn will cause the anger of the masses and attack the shops. When boy scouts see this situation, they must investigate the truth of the facts and send them to the competent authorities for handling. Many shop employees are fortunate to avoid being beaten thanks to the mediation of the boy scouts. There are also countless displaced war refugees who receive travel expenses to return to their hometowns, which is also thanks to the help of these boy scouts, because the boy scouts can find ways to transport them to safe places. There are also many refugee families who have been dispersed due to the war, and boy scouts often have the opportunity to meet them and help them reunite. On the other hand, the boy scouts also collect donations from house to house for the items needed at the front line, and also take on other important work back and forth in the fire line.</p>
<p>The First New Martyr</p>
<p>The boy scout brothers are all happy to go to the front line to serve, but their military knowledge and young age are not enough to take on this kind of work. During the January 28 Incident, the Shanghai Boy Scouts did a lot of great work for the army, starting with setting up telephones, managing traffic, repairing telephone lines, and also helping to repair the walls of Suzhou and stacking sandbags for defensive works, and building a 20-kilometer military road from Kunshan to Suzhou. When the army was about to mobilize, the boy scouts were even busier with all the assistance work. For a period of time, they also carried guns and fought alongside the army!</p>
<p>Also in the places where various disasters remain, these little heroes will be sent there to work. When they were rescuing refugees at Yuqiaqing Road and Edward Road and other places, one of their brothers was a victim of the tragedy in front of the Great World. This admirable little Chinese hero, he is China's first new martyr!</p>
